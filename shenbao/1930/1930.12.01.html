<p>本年九月二十日倫敦日報（ＬｏｎｄｏｎＤａｉｌｙＨｅｒａｌｄ）載有一段發自孟買之電文題爲「日本侵佔印度市塲」其内容如次目前印度國會雖然竭力主張提倡國貨抵制外貨但是日本運到印度去的貨物反見增加想不到印度許多甘地信徒頭上所戴的帽子現在都是日貨而本年上半期（一月至六月）自日運印的棉花和人造絲比較去年同期增加八○○○○○○碼比較前年（一九二八年）增加二二○○○○○○碼</p>
<h3>英商圑之使命</h3>
<p>英國遠東經濟考察圑領袖湯姆森爵士（ＳｉｒＥｒｎｅｓｔＴｈｏｍｐｓｏｎ）曾說「本圑漫游遠東目的在觀察英國對華對日貿易的現狀並謀所以改進之方我們對於目前遠東貿易的情形很不滿意現在應該知道自已錯誤之所在那幾處不能適應市塲的需要爲什麽失去了從前的主要貿易地位怎樣可以恢復已經損失的商業現在我們每個圑員都負有重大的責任這是政府付託我們的現在應該研究目前困難的原因盼望我們重返故鄉的時候不但能將遠東市塲的希望和需要詳細報失英國商界還要設法戰勝許多目前阻碍商業的困難方才不負此行</p>

<h3>英國遠東經濟考察圑抵滬攝影（本館攝）</h3>
<p>近來中國雖然頻演内亂但是他的對外貿易數値與年俱增譬如目前他的進口貨値比較一九一三年增加一倍一九二八年竟達一七八六○○○○○○金鎊之鉅從前英國在華市塲曾佔優勝的地位現在却喪失了因爲目前英國在華貿易比較一九一四年减少一半同時我們的商塲勁敵接踵而起所以英國實業界目前最要緊的便是尋出失敗的原因關於供給中國的貨品那種地方我們不及其他各國現在要適應中國的需要應取那種步驟</p>
<h3>英商之勁敵</h3>
<p>我們關於中國的需要旣然要悉心研究而對於競爭各國的推銷方法也要詳加考察然後知道怎樣可以改進目前的貿易和競爭各國抗衡我們希望看見中國實業發展之象始能對於一般增進生產能率者有所匡助我們歡迎時常接到中國發展的報告洞悉了發展的情形才能增進中英的貿易現在中國的人口約佔世界人數四分之一他的生活程度只要稍爲提高一些便可使國際貿易有迅速的增加英國對華貿易棉花一項約佔總額的百分之三十五以上約佔中國輸入總額的百分之十五本圑所要考察的範圍非僅限於棉業並且包括羊毛絨線鋼鐵等業這許多貨品每年運華的數額很大所以我們對於這幾種實業最要留意觀察</p>

<h3>記天目山之奇獸</h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>頃有閣黎自天目山來告訴我一件怪獸食猴事頗爲離奇現在我把它</p>
<p>寫出來</p>
<p>浙西的天目山界於臨安於潛安吉和安徽的寗國間層巒疊嶂箐密林深山中多禽獸更多猴子並且常常有怪獸發現而西天目山中有一種奇獸形狀大小和狐狸差不多但毛色頭尾是黑的腰間是黄的所以呌做黄腰狸黄腰狸能坐能立四肢都像手各有五指惟前脚的指頭較長能握物它善於爬樹在樹上從這株跳到那株比松鼠還要輕捷原來松鼠過樹須要抓着那株樹的枝條方能過去他呢只要抓着那株樹的葉兒便能過去的</p>
<p>黄腰狸生性兇狠什麽野獸都怕它它最喜歡吃猴子吃法很奇它遠遠看見羣猴子便發聲喝住那羣猴一聽到他的聲音便　觫站住不敢稍動於是它就走近去用兩隻前脚把羣猴一一抱過抱時衆猴都俯首帖耳不敢反抗它抱得那隻最重便拾一張樹葉放在那隻猴子的頭上然後再喊一聲驅散那些頭上没有樹葉的猴子衆猴聞聲就都惴惴的慢慢走開只乘那隻頭上放樹葉的站着結它果腹可是老猴子雖然身重却能幸免困老猴子常常遇到了黄腰狸估計他們身體的輕重胆子益練益大而且知道黄腰狸吃它們是擇肥而噬的於是被抱的時候就用避重就輕的方法來對付把前身用虚乘勢輕輕向上以减輕其身體所以身雖重的也能脫險至於小猴了對於黄腰狸吃他們的事經騐旣少胆子又小故一遇到便駭極而昏被抱時都拚命用前脚拉住地下的草於是身體越發重了所以給黄腰狸當點心吃的總是這些小猴子</p>
<p>黄腰狸非但能吃猴子且能吃性兇力在的虎豹它見了虎豹便跳到它們的臀部上去舔肛門控肚貨吃它旣跳上了虎豹的臀部任豹怎樣奔騰跳躍總慣不下他的所以虎豹見了他没有不拚命逃避的</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（二十五）從大連到上海</p>
<p>「我是决定再回到上海去了」我這樣向老楊提議過幾次</p>
<p>「爲什麽呢你在這裏多逗留些時也許大連能獲得一個較好的位子况且你回到上海生活能有把握嗎」</p>
<p>的確我屢次給他這末了一句話兀住了現在學校都已經秋季開學了你是没有法再能鑽進去别的職業於我更是没有把握而且上海的友人們都以爲我這次是北地遨游歸來了但他們何知我實在是狼狽竄返呢於是我又不能不如起初北行時的聽隨運命的波移了然我終於還是離開了大連</p>
<p>「似乎運命是這樣注定了我不我是在與運命抗爭着啊」離上海的時候我是如此想着的如今又重想着了然而遣又何嘗不是運命的把戲呢</p>
<p>十二分感謝老楊殷勤地把我送上了海船</p>
<p>在船上一件不快意的事我因爲躱避水手們工作時所起的灰塵立站在一個靜闢的窗口觀看海景忽然一個日本茶房鼠子般地走來趕我離開那裏這眞使我生氣但我知道日本人是有一種專欺中國人而怕西洋人的下賤性的而且如果我使他知道我是一等乘客的話那也可以有到處站立的自由了於是我用英語給他說</p>
<p>「Mr　What　do　you　dol　I　am　passenger　in　lirst　class…」立刻這日本茶房跑開了如果我是一個英國人的話也許他會給我行一個一百度的鞠躬</p>
<p>在兩三日的海程中腦海裏也同樣無止息地起着思潮一切已往現在與未來的歡温悲創激憤愁慮與幻想全部陸續地在腦海裏洶湧與幻化</p>
<p>因爲愛情的埀死因爲友誼的破滅因爲生活的脅迫因爲幻滅後的一個新憧憬我毅然地抱了於江南長别的决心在飛着雪的凛凝的寒氣中揮着冷顫的手往北地流浪然誰料這却是一個夢的追求流泊在凍冽的北地僅僅半載便又狼猖地踏上了歸程但這又是一個渺范的憧憬呢即在自身最迫切的生活方法就　着一個絶大的疑問你更有何超於一已以上的理想之可能</p>
<p>然而終於在紛亂的思潮的幻化中海船是泊了上海的邊岸</p>
<p>「呵上海啊我這個Vagrant終於還是投入你的懷抱呀」</p>
<p>一輛人力車將我和兩件與我一樣風僅僅多行囊載往上海熱閙的中心的一家旅館裏</p>
<p>我不等休憩行旅的疲勞就去找我想念着的幾個友人誰知都没有過着恨然地走回來然在新世界前面的人舊中却掽且了老徐</p>
<p>什麽海風又把你捲回到上海」</p>
<p>「夢曉得也許我的靈魂失落在上海」</p>

<h3>上課前後</h3>
<p>— 君平</p>
<p>「靜我剛才看了佈告下點鐘有一個美國的愽士要到我們學校求演講所以下點鐘的社會學我是不去上了你歡喜麽去聽聽美國愽士的演講」</p>
<p>突地英把我的房門推門來她看到我在看書就把我的書用手掌住像怕我不去聽他的話似的</p>
<p>「這樣値得大驚小怪的美國的愽士演講　没有聽見過麽」不歡喜聽演講的我有些自私了</p>
<p>「要知道演講的人不是中國的美國愽士呢」</p>
<p>「是我知道」</p>
<p>你那裏知道還没有看過佈告」</p>
<p>「你曉得我没有看過佈告麽演講的是當那博士美國密西根大學的敎授也是本校特約的講師今天第一次到校來講演」</p>
<p>英點頭没有話回答她已知道我不願意去聽雷那愽士的講演就旋了個轉身走了</p>
<p>一個小小的敎室放了三十多隻椅子和一個小小的講臺以後就差不多没有空地了敎室的面積旣是這樣小椅子又放了這麽多自然椅子和椅子間的距離也是很小的就是當中剩下來的那條路也是那樣狹的一條</p>
<p>學校裏好像是特地優侍我們似的約有四十多個人選讀的社會學就把我們排在這個敎室裏上課這樣一來遲到的同學自然是没有椅子坐的於是他們就不得不到别個敎室裏去拿了幾條椅子進來這樣一個小小的敎室好像變得愈小了</p>
<p>這差不多已是成了每次上社會學時的慣例了在没有到上課的時候以前三四十個同學就都開着快步的向了這個小小的敎室裏進發等到上課的鐘響了以後就有幾隻椅子從外面拿進來向了敎室的前面塞住</p>
<p>可是今天的情形却有些不同敎室裏不但没有以前那樣的擁擠而且空氣也好像緩和了許多這自然是因爲一部分同學去聽演講的緣故</p>
<p>「今天爲什麽有許多人没有來」</p>
<p>社會學的敎授王先生带了他那副滑稽的臉孔進來了他照常地呈了一副可掬的笑容先用了他那雙載着近視眼鏡的眼睛向我們瞟了幾眼然後把他手上拿着的粉筆和點名册緩緩地放了下來他覺得今天突地少了這許多人未免是有别的原因存在於是他就用了疑問的語氣開口說了這一句</p>
<p>「嘻嘻嘻………」同學們看到他那副滑稽的臉孔就都不由的笑了起來他的話被這笑聲模糊了</p>
<p>「他們已去聽演講了」一個做假正經的同學回答</p>
<p>「演講什麽人來此地演講」</p>
<p>王先生聽到那個同學說演講就詫異起來</p>
<p>「一個美國的愽士」另一個同學搶着答</p>
<p>「…………………………」</p>
<p>王先生呆着了他就把點名册翻開來右手拿了一枝鉛筆自上而下的一個個呌着呌到一個同學的名字他就向那個同學的面上看了一眼像怕不老實的同學代别人報到似的</p>
<p>他這樣的一個一個呌着呌了一聲「密司脫趙振青」以後他忽而呆住了　以爲自已没有留意致把趙振青所回答的一聲「到」没有聽清楚於是他就　　地再呌了兩聲「密司脫趙振青密司趙………」</p>
<p>「哈哈哈………」接看是一陣同學們的笑聲</p>
<p>敎室裏頓時熱閙了起來密司密司的聲浪充滿了各人的耳鼓好像整個敎室裏的空氣都被密司吸引了這樣一來自然是吃虧那幾個坐在角落裏的女同學害得她們紅着臉緊緊地閉着口不敢聲響</p>
<p>王先生把名點了後就把點名册合上將那本缺了一隻角的講稿打開來台手拿了一枝粉筆來開始講了於是坐在這個小小的敎室裡聽講的二十幾個同學也就沉默下來</p>

<h3>炒栗子與戲劇</h3>
<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>散課後大多數的同學都挾着書包走回他們的寄宿舍只剩下十幾個××劇圑的圑員還在休息室裏流連著並且忙忙碌地正在整理道具因爲明後天又要出去公演了</p>
<p>「眞糟糕茶花女的情難透了××先生總要呌我担任我是該倒楣的嗎」芳㙭着嘴半喜半怒地說</p>
<p>「因爲你能夠體貼才呌你去他怎麽不派了我呢」在塊頭芹緊接着反駁了她細聽音發自那張胖臉裏邊使人感到一種滑稽的意義</p>
<p>「你也不錯有喜劇的天才」正在整理一件披風的林回轉頭來對她恭维著</p>
<p>被悶住在嗓了裏的笑聲咯咯地充滿了一室</p>
<p>只聽得有人大喊「你們好快樂也不通知我一聲」高幹子的彪從外面跳進來拍的一下一包什麽打在林的背上頓時紙包散開許多圓圓的東西滾滿了一地大家爭著去搶</p>
<p>「是炒栗子很好還是良鄉的呢」芹一面吃一面說因爲滿嘴都是栗子的緣故那臉便越發漲大了「你們天天說我大塊頭大塊頭應該多吃些」她的言語是渾合著栗子殼的破裂聲和咭咭咯咯的咀嚼聲同時發出所以非常含糊她彎著腰隨揀隨吃人們見她那滾滾的圓背脊幾乎變成球形了淘氣的芳忽然把臉一扳正模正樣地問「誰拿來的這一張來派名書」</p>
<p>「在那裏啊」但是話未說完轟然一聲笑聲幾乎震破這間小屋子了「確乎是人物背景都是一律圓形的難爲你買了這包好栗子來」林吃吃地笑着用肘推推高幹子的臂膊大家聽見了這句話從新又大笑起來芳手裏的栗子都撒在地上許多人用手去摩自已的肚子說一我的氣透不過來了」</p>
<p>「你們笑我我明天做起普于當斯來呌你小心一點我不同你們做介紹人看你這茶花女要不要急煞」芹用手指着芳又對林映映眼睛</p>
<p>大家見芹的嘴停住了一看地上的栗子早已不見忙問「還有栗子呢怎麽都完了」</p>
<p>「嚇是你們自已讓我吃的還要問」</p>
<p>「誰也不曾讓你啊」芳嘻嘻地質問她</p>
<p>「在你們笑的時候我就代勞了」</p>
<p>啊喲我們上當了許多人同聲說像一陣潮水冲翻了提岸</p>
<p>栗子旣然吃了不成大家只好靜靜地坐下來討論戲劇了「人家說歐洲的劇本搬到中國舞台上來的時候就會變成東方代和缺乏熱情的東西其實這也不是過分的話我們的女主角常常是太怕羞不放替劇中人發揮情感就像西哈諾裏邊的霍克桑也不是一個東方式的嬌小姐所能夠勝任的在許多次公演的時</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>候最吃緊的地方如第三幕末節克利斯將新婚　别這一段在歐洲女子演來一定是緊張到萬分把劇中人震抖的靈魂從各種的動作上表現出來一直傳達到觀衆的震抖的心靈裏然而中國的霍克桑是不敢接吻不敢擁抱的她只是冷靜地說著刻板的話所以一般批評家總覺得女演員的訓練未免太欠工夫了一林搖著披在腦後的長頭結束自已的談話</p>
<p>你說的也何嘗不對可是責人易而責已難輪到身上也就做不得主了你說她們不接吻不擁抱是過於忽略豈不知台前觀衆也是未經訓練的中國觀衆啊倘使這樣做了你知道他們對於這個女主角要說些什麽閒話並且女生角的愛人和别的男朋友也不願她過於認眞吧你們男子都是自私自利的還說什麽芹今天也開著話匣子了不知是妙粟子的功勞不是</p>
<p>芳本來坐在窗檻上此時便跳下來喊道一你們不要一掃帚打殺幾千螞蟻中國女子也不是人人都是嬌小姐的我雖然没有受過多少訓練却不能像那些旣想出風頭又怕人笑話的人這樣扭揑假使不能把劇中人的靈魂裝在自已的身體裏邊使她盡量地活動起來根本就不必談藝術」</p>
<p>長頭髮林對高幹子的耳邊低低說「可見人是要激的我們希望她這次的茶花女能夠成功」他於是首先鼓掌</p>
<p>高幹子彪也拍拍地附和着芹這天特别高興兩隻多肉的手掌一上一下的拍打起來發出不調和而重带的響聲此時休息室裏的人已漸漸散去祗剩得寥寥幾個了傍晚的太陽光淡淡地鑽進了這間小屋照著青年們快樂的面孔發出明亮的光彩墻脚邊排列著許多箱子劍用舊了的羽冠等等一束惟悴的人造茶花靜靜地躺在壁角裏象徵著被遺棄的茶花女的身世</p>
<p>一串響亮的聲音從窗邊送來好像是從高處落下的一些什麽聽的人立刻知道是高幹子也在發議論了「我們的劇圑初成立的時候這裏一個社那裏一個圑熱閙得不亦樂乎閙了一陣子忽然又都冷淡了到現在還有誰肯拼命去幹除開我們這個　子之外」</p>
<p>别人正想接著他的話突然各個的視線都不約而同的集中在方桌上一這是什麽大家看」聲音還没有完手絹包已被人攫來打開」票子是剛才的票子」芳快樂地喊起來</p>
<p>微笑掛在人人的臉上不到一會便只有許多空殼散佈在地下了獨有芹一人不吃她淡淡地笑着說「假使不是我用點小計你們只顧吃那裏還顧得了研究戲劇明天茶花女的成功要歸到我的票子身上的呢一吃夜飯鐘打了她們走後許多票子殼熱閙地擠滿了一地彷佛是預先報告著明天觀衆們擠軋的樣子</p>

If Yan realizes this, Chen will protect him and escort him to Tianjin. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing: A telegram from Taiyuan states that Yan has decided to leave Shanxi on the 1st. Shang Zhen has telegraphed Jiang and Zhang to report this. It is heard that Zhang has telegraphed Wang Shuchang to send a car to meet and escort him abroad. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Shang Zhen received a reply telegram from Zhang Xueliang stating that all safety and dignity issues along the way for Yan's departure abroad can be guaranteed. He will return north in the next few days and will send a special train to Shijiazhuang to meet him and dispatch senior officials to escort him, etc. Shang immediately took this telegram to Wutai Mountain to show Yan, but Yan still could not be completely reassured. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: In recent days, troops from various units of the Shanxi Army have continued to move towards northern Shanxi and Suiyuan.

<p>Nanjing: After Zhang Xueliang returned to Nanjing from Zhenjiang, he originally planned to go north on the morning of the 30th.

It was decided that he would cross the river at night. Some of his staff who went to Pukou entered the city in the morning to purchase supplies and returned to Pukou to board the train in the evening.

The staff members staying at the Central Hotel were also socializing in various places and showed no signs of leaving. It is also heard that Zhang was originally scheduled to return north on the 30th, but because there were still important official matters to be discussed with Jiang upon his return to Nanjing, and also because the central government would have an important meeting on the 1st, which he needed to attend, he postponed it. According to people around Zhang, he would probably leave in the afternoon of the 1st or the morning of the 2nd. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>America's Policy of National Seclusion</h3>
<p>The US government recently discussed formulating new immigration laws that not only strictly prohibit the entry of people of color but also uniformly prohibit Europeans, South Americans, and Filipinos under the same flag as the US. Therefore, people recently regard the current policy of the United States as completely implementing the ancient national policy of seclusion. In other words, it is restoring the closed-door policy of the past. The reason why Americans were once content under the closed-door policy was that the United States had a vast territory and abundant resources, and the population was not very large. They did not need to seek anything from the outside world and did not need to travel far across the oceans to come into contact with the world. Moreover, they had the two oceans to the east and west as their natural barriers, so there was no fear of invasion. Everyone was happy to live in peace and self-sufficiency. Later, when industry developed and goods became abundant, they had to seek commercial markets abroad. Therefore, they changed to openness. Now, shocked by the tide of economic downturn, it is difficult for commerce to develop abroad, while other countries want to take the opportunity to develop towards the US. Countries with large populations are eager to seek immigration to the US, which is the natural trend of today. It is also normal for Americans to feel the coming of this trend and revive the idea of closing the door. Throughout history, the extreme of civilizational progress has always easily provoked the reaction of restoring the old. Just as this time, the development of machinery and the surplus of goods have led to a disastrous situation in the business world. Some writers in the United States have advocated destroying machines and restoring handicrafts to ensure people's livelihood. Although this came from a temporary激论, it is not entirely insufficient to represent the ancient psychology of some people. 推之In politics, several countries in Europe have launched movements to restore autocratic politics due to the many disturbances of parliamentary politics. This is also an example. However, this kind of restoration ideology is just a temporary反激influence in the progress of civilization and will eventually disappear. How can the closed-door policy of the US truly have a day of realization again?</p>

<h3>Germany Protests Polish Telegrams</h3>
<p>Lists Facts of Abuse of Minorities</p>
<p>Requests that the League of Nations Uphold Justice</p>
<p>Geneva, 29th of National News Agency: Today, Germany sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, asking the great powers to pay attention to the abuse of the German minority before and after the Polish elections. It claimed that Polish violent elements, with the help of the authorities, committed various atrocities that violated the solemn agreement allowing the German people in Poland to exercise their Polish citizenship rights without any hindrance. It demanded compensation for the loss of life and property suffered by the German people and guaranteed that the same atrocities would not happen again in the future. Finally, it requested that the Council of the League of Nations include this matter on the agenda of the January regular meeting. The telegram detailed various atrocities, stating that in November, the German people were forcibly deprived of their right to vote. For example, in the Katowice area, 30,000 people who had participated in elections or held Polish public office were suddenly accused of failing to provide sufficient proof of nationality and were removed from the voter registration. Other German people were also subjected to various forms of oppression and even violence to force them to vote for government party candidates. In view of the complexity of the political situation in Poland, it is difficult to avoid sudden conflicts during elections. However, this time, systematic acts of terror were carried out specifically against the German people. For example, the thugs in Upper Silesia repeatedly attacked German villages, abused the villagers, and burned their houses. The victims appealed to the Polish police, who turned a deaf ear and turned a blind eye. A summary of ten cases is attached, clearly stating the location, name, and facts of the abuse as supporting evidence. The telegram ended by stating that the actions of the Polish people not only violated international law but also ran counter to humanitarianism. The League of Nations should immediately intervene and force Poland to strictly comply with the agreement to protect the interests of minorities.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Moscow, 29th - Lai Muxun, the first defendant in the Soviet Russian industrial sabotage case, confessed his resume, saying that after graduating, he worked in an industrial technical school.

After the implementation of the New Economic Policy, he served as the director of the Fuel Division of the Government Design Committee, and later as the director of the Thermal School. When the Soviet Union began construction work, he again participated in the actual struggle against the Soviet system. He has written 150 scientific books in his life, 30 of which have been translated into other languages. During the October Revolution, he engaged in defending the Moscow City Hall against the communist attacks. In 1927, he went to Paris on official business and discussed foreign intervention with other Russians. He is not opposed to all Soviet Russian plans. He also supports state capitalism, believing that coal and oil should not be operated by private individuals, but he believes that the Soviet system is enough to destroy the country, so he ultimately opposes it.

<h3>Telegram from Chahar</h3>
<p>All newspapers are informed that Chahar Province is located in the remote northern part of Hebei, where the people are poor. For four years, disasters and famines have been reported repeatedly.

In the afternoon, at 4:30, Li Hanzhang led the troops south. Also, the bandit leader Xu San's force in Wuding has more than a thousand people. A few days ago, Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 12th Army, personally led the 20th Division, 59th Brigade, to suppress them, killing three to four hundred bandits and seizing five to six hundred guns. The remaining bandits all escaped into the sea by boat. The government troops have no boats, and the seawater is shallow, so warships cannot enter. In the future, small warships will be needed to eliminate the bandits. As for the bandits in Xiajin, they have been dispersed by Ma Jingong's troops of the 60th Brigade of the 20th Division of the 12th Army. The bandits led by Wang Jinfa in Dongchang Guantao have occupied the area for half a year. Recently, they were also defeated by Rong Guangxing's troops of the 87th Brigade of the 29th Division of the 14th Army, and the remaining bandits fled into Hebei Province. The most rampant now are the combined forces of Wang Si Da Gezi in Linqu and the remnants of Gao Guizi's troops, numbering no less than three to four thousand people. The headquarters has sent Qiao Lizhi, the commander of the 74th Division of the 14th Army, to lead his troops and a guard regiment to suppress them. When the bandits saw the troops approaching, they fled into the mountains southwest of the county. Because Qiao's division was unfamiliar with the terrain, they have not yet penetrated deeply. In addition, the bandit force led by Wang Ziming in Anqiu Jiaoxian still appears from time to time. A few days ago, they even kidnapped people at the South Gate of Anqiu. The headquarters has ordered Zhan Shutang's troops of the 73rd Division stationed in Weifang to conduct a serious search and suppression. (November 27th)</p>
<h3>Change of Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence - The change of chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee has been brewing for many days. Yesterday (the 27th), the Jiaoji Railway Bureau finally received a formal order from the Ministry of Railways. The current chairman, Sa Fujun, will return to the position of Director of the Engineering Department of the Ministry of Railways. The vacant position will be filled by Ge Guangting, the Director of the Northern Section of the Pinghan Railway. Ge is from Anhui and has held important positions in the military and political circles. He is currently assisting Zhang Xueliang in Beijing. He will go north with Zhang in the next few days. He must wait until he returns to the Pinghan Railway Bureau to hand over his duties before he can come to Qingdao to take office. Currently, Sa has ordered the Railway Bureau to handle the handover. If Ge is unable to come to Qingdao recently, Sa plans to go to Beijing early to return to his original position and hand over his duties. Then Lu Mengxiong, a member of the committee, will handle the matter on his behalf. As for the rumors that the committee system of the Jiaoji Railway will be abolished and changed back to the bureau director system, the appointment of Ge Guangting as chairman by the Ministry of Railways this time shows that it is not accurate.

<h3>Relocation of the Longhai Railway Bureau Back to Zhengzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence - The Longhai Railway Administration was originally located in Zhengzhou. After the military operations this spring, the road to Xuzhou and Zhengzhou was blocked. Qian Zongze took over as the director of the bureau and set up an office in Xuzhou. In fact, it was no different from setting up the railway bureau in Xuzhou. As soon as the road to Zhengzhou was opened, Qian sent staff to Zhengzhou to take over the Zhengzhou bureau. However, for convenience, the office was still located in Xuzhou. As a result, the overall plan for the road proposed to move the Administration from Zhengzhou to Xuzhou. According to people in the railway, it would be better to set up the bureau in Xuzhou for business purposes, but it would still be better to set up the bureau in Zhengzhou for engineering purposes. Qian Zongze also submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways for instructions. Now that the entire line has been opened and the construction of the western section is still pending, the bureau has been ordered to still be located in Zhengzhou. However, the existing facilities in Xuzhou are also planned to be expanded to facilitate operations. Qian has also reorganized the bureau's organization and recently announced the appointment of Yu Shibin as the Director of the General Affairs Department, Huang Xuezou as the Deputy Director, Zhuang Jishi as the Director of the Engineering Department, Huang Zhaotong as the Director of the Transportation Department, Lin Yichun as the Director of the Locomotive Department, Liu Zhitian as the Director of the Accounting Department, and Zuo Lin as the Chief Secretary. The road's transportation and engineering affairs are divided into two sections: from Dapu to Mamuji is the first section, and from Mamuji to Lingbao is the second section. The road's police affairs are divided into three sections: Qiu Shijie is the Director of the First General Section, Wang Gengyu is the Director of the Second General Section, and Zhang Jie is the Director of the Third General Section. All have taken office. Qian is scheduled to go to Zhengzhou from Xuzhou tomorrow (the 30th) to preside over the bureau's affairs. All the personnel in Xuzhou have already left Xuzhou by train tonight to go west to Zhengzhou to make arrangements. (November 29th)</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong Passes Through Xuzhou to Tongguan</h3>
<p>The Northwest Headquarters Has Moved from Luoyang to Tongguan</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence - Gu Zhutong, the director of the Luoyang Headquarters, went to Beijing at the end of the month to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions on the organization of the headquarters. The headquarters was also established and has been moved from Luoyang to Tongguan during this period. Currently, the headquarters has been renamed the Northwest Headquarters, specializing in presiding over the affairs of the Northwest military and post-war matters. Gu returned to Xuzhou on the morning of the 26th by the Hubei-Guangdong armored train at 3:00 pm after returning from Beijing. The commander of the 52nd Division, Han Deqin, went to Beijing after taking office to meet with Chiang Kai-shek for instructions. Therefore, he returned to Xuzhou on the same train with Gu. On the train, Gu told reporters that the Northwest Headquarters had entered Tongguan and that he was going west to Tongguan to handle all the affairs of the headquarters. The central government has a whole plan for the post-war work in the Northwest. From the perspective of the situation in the Northwest, it is believed that there is no need to use military force again, and it can be resolved by peaceful means. Gu expressed optimism about the post-war work in the Northwest, believing that there would be no problems in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai. During the conversation, Liu Fengqi, the commander of the 1st Cavalry Division, came to Xuzhou from Bian and was introduced to Gu by Ma Hongda. Liu said that the division was reorganized from the cavalry of Zheng Dazhang's troops in the Northwest and had the news that they were gathering in eastern Shandong to enter Henan. Therefore, he went to Beijing to ask for instructions. Ma and Liu then bid farewell. Ma went north. Han invited Gu to the division headquarters for a rest. Gu had matters to attend to in Xuzhou and delayed for two hours before transferring to the Longhai Railway west to Tongguan. A part of the headquarters personnel accompanied him. It is said that the headquarters will advance west from Tongguan when necessary to gradually handle the post-war work in the Northwest. (November 27th)</p>
<h3>Eastern and Western Bandit Forces in Xuzhou Have Been Defeated</h3>
<p>Suixian, Si County, and Other Counties Are Handling Post-War Matters. Xuzhou Correspondence - The two major bandit forces in eastern and western Xuzhou have been separately suppressed by the military and police of various counties. It is now known that the bandits in the eastern part of Xuzhou at the junction of Suixian, Si County, and the bandits in the western part of Xuzhou at the junction of Tongshan, Xiao County, and Suixian have been separately defeated and searched and cleared. The bandits in the area of Suixian, Si County, and the bandits in the eastern part of Xuzhou were suppressed by Liu Jiashu's troops of the 4th Regiment of the 52nd Division stationed in Xuzhou, starting from Lingchengji and Buziji. After that, they joined forces with the police and militia of the three counties to destroy the bandit den in Guirenji. The bandits fled southwestward. The 52nd Division again dispatched He Kunxiong's troops of the 6th Regiment to continue the suppression. At that time, Liu's troops had chased the bandits to ChuanChengji in Anhui Province and contacted He's troops to advance, pursuing and searching. The bandit leader Liu Rongduo and others led the remnants to flee to northern Anhui. The captured bandit leader Sha Huozi is still under military escort to help capture the remaining bandits. Currently, Suixian, Si County, and other counties are handling the post-war matters of the bandits. For the sake of peace in the area, Liu and He's troops have not returned to their original defenses for the time being. As for the bandits at the junction of Tongshan, Xiao County, and Suixian, the three counties' police brigades launched a joint suppression in Cailiji. The bandit leader Zhang Chuanwen led his forces to flee to Zhaolou, 40 miles west of Xi Kou. The authorities of the three counties had made considerable contacts before the joint suppression and followed the bandits with the local militia. The bandits then fled west from Zhaolou, joined the defeated soldiers on the border of Henan and Anhui, and advanced towards Yongcheng. The police brigade of Yongcheng County also set out to intercept them and contacted the police brigade of Suixian to encircle and suppress the bandits from the southwest. The bandits then fled to the northwest. Currently, the three counties are searching for the remaining bandits in Cailiji and have stipulated three measures: (1) Clear out the bandit hideouts. (2) Deploy police teams for defense and prevention. (3) Clear out</p>

<h3>Garrison Troops in Fengshun Break Communist Party Organs in Eastern River</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence - Recently, the remaining Red Army of the 11th Army of Gu Dacun, a Communist bandit in the Chao-Mei area of Guangdong Province, was hunted down by the 62nd Division of the garrison troops and hid in the forests of Jiulongzhang Mountain in Eight Townships, Fengshun County. On the 20th of this month, the Fengshun garrison troops, led by Kong Kequan's Regiment, led by a surrendered Communist Party member and the Shanglinkeng Chanzhou Guard, searched the bandit dens in the Jiulongzhang Mountains. Kong's Regiment took the machine gun Browning team as the backbone, and divided the troops into two groups to advance. When they reached Shihuangqi Xinchating, they encountered the sentries of the Pseudo-East River Political Guard and the Second Column of the Pseudo-Red Army 11th Army. When the bandits saw the anti-bandit troops arrive, they fled to Maotoutu Yamaan Keng. Kong's Regiment chased and fired, killing countless bandits. They pursued to Langdangshi Yezhuhu and found a pseudo-Soviet government of Pseudo-East River with a third Pseudo-Notice posted on the door, signed by the bandit leaders Chen Kuiya (from Haifeng), Gu Dacun, Chen Yaochao, Yan Hanzhang, Li Zijun, Ye Yanji, Fang Guangqing, Li Guo (all from Dazhan Township, Fengshun), Li Chongsan, Huang Yanfang, He Ping, Long Wenhe, Gu Hongguang, Zhu Zigan, Chen Kaiqin, etc. A monthly report and many pseudo-seals and reactionary propaganda items were found in the pseudo-organ. On the same day, the bandit leaders Chen Kuiya, Gu Dacun, etc. fled to Gouwei Mountain without any resistance. According to the captured bandits, the bandit gang had previously hidden in Jiulongzhang, and after being besieged by Kong's Regiment, they fled to Bajia Mountain and were hunted down by Li Zhenliang's troops of the Wuhua Defense Army. Due to lack of food, they recently sneaked back near Jiulongzhang to find food and have no resistance, and will soon be wiped out. That night, Kong's Regiment camped in the mountains of DaAo Li. On the 21st, they returned to Fengshun City. In this battle, dozens of bandits were killed and one was captured alive. The remaining bandits fled to Dazhegang Ganzi Mountain Langdangshi YangQiu Keng.

<h3>Chaoan County in Guangdong Planting a Large Number of Tobacco Seedlings</h3>
<p>There Are More Than 2,800 Acres</p>
<p>The County Magistrate Only Now Vigorously Eliminates Them</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence - In the counties of Chaozhou Prefecture, Guangdong Province, this winter, some people are falsely sending personnel to various townships to persuade opium cultivation. Poppy cultivation has spread across the fields, filling the eyes. Local people have expressed their displeasure. This matter was heard by Xiang Hanping, the commander of the 62nd Division of the garrison troops, who issued an order to eliminate the tobacco. After the announcement, all poisonous plants must be eradicated. If a tobacco seedling is found again, the battalion, company, platoon leader, and all the members of the guard team in the area will be held guilty and shot without mercy. After this order was issued, Ruan Shuqing, the magistrate of Chaoan County, summoned the entire county's guard brigade, joint defense director, police district director, and the township autonomy association to hold a large meeting on tobacco eradication in the county government and enacted twelve measures, charging the Baos and Jiaz with handing over the tenants who planted tobacco, confiscating the fields, and printing the resolutions overnight and sending personnel to distribute them to various townships. Also, they prepared a survey table on the eradication of tobacco seedlings and ordered the police district directors to fill them out on the spot, so that personnel could be sent to various districts to conduct inspections. According to the reports filled out at the meeting that day, only ten districts in Fucheng, Chaoan County, did not plant opium. The most prosperous tobacco planting areas were the eight districts of Jiangdong, with an area of approximately 2,700 to 800 acres. Jiangdong district occupied 2,000 acres, Nangui district had more than 400 acres, and Longjin Chenglong districts had approximately 100 acres. Dongguan Qiushui Dahe and Dengyun districts had approximately 100 acres. Zhuang Boxi, the former chairman of the Jiangdong District Security Association, had his son Zhuang Zijing sheltering opium planting in the district. He was detained by the Chaoan County Government and sentenced to two years in prison with a three-year probation and a fine of 1,000 yuan. He paid 500 yuan on the 24th and was bailed out by a shop. The remaining 500 yuan must be paid within five days. After Zhuang Boxi was arrested in Jiangdong District, the villagers saw the government's vigorous efforts to eradicate tobacco and realized that they had been deceived by treacherous people. Fearing punishment, they competed to eradicate it first. It is said that other counties in Chaozhou will also follow up with tobacco eradication. Jiyang County also issued a tobacco eradication notice yesterday, but it has not yet been implemented. (26th)</p>
<h3>Hankow Municipal Government's Recent Diplomatic Engagements</h3>
<p>Since the abolition of the Diplomatic Affairs Bureau, diplomatic matters within Hubei Province are handled by the Hubei Civil Affairs Department, and those within Hankow City are handled by the Hankow Municipal Government. Recent diplomatic engagements of the Hankow Municipal Government are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3>Sinking of the Wanxin Steamer by a Japanese Vessel</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the Japanese warship stationed in Hankow sinking the Chinese Wanxin steamer, the Hankow Municipal Government repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese Consulate without result. On the 26th, it dispatched Health Bureau Director Li Bowen as a representative to the Japanese Consulate for further negotiations. He met with the Japanese Consul-General Itagaki Junzo. Li stated that the municipal government's investigation and received reports on the Wanxin steamer case differed greatly from the Consul's response. However, the municipal government deeply hoped for a prompt resolution to avoid harming relations between the two countries. The Consul responded that he shared the desire for a prompt resolution and that the commander of the Hirado warship had been recalled to Japan and would depart by the end of the month. If the person involved leaves Hankow, future resolution would be difficult. However, the circumstances described in the Chinese government's letter differed greatly from the Navy's report received by the Consul. Li replied that the municipal government's investigation and reports were based on sufficient facts and reasons. The Consul stated that exchanging arguments based on conflicting investigations and reports would be futile and would not lead to a resolution. Since the incident involved a warship and a merchant vessel, and neither the representative nor the Consul were present at the scene, it was difficult to ascertain the true circumstances. Out of a desire for Sino-Japanese friendship, the Consul proposed that the Chinese government and its representative, along with the Consul and naval authorities, convene a meeting of the involved parties from both the warship and the merchant vessel to investigate the incident and jointly handle the matter to achieve an early resolution. Li responded that the Consul's intention demonstrated the spirit of Sino-Japanese friendship and that he would convey the Consul's suggestion to the Mayor for consideration. Li then excused himself and returned to the municipal government to report on the negotiations. It is said that Liu Wendao also expressed his approval, and the municipal government will convene a meeting for both parties to negotiate within the day.</p>
<h3>Removal of Fortress in French Concession</h3>
<p>The Hankow Municipal Government repeatedly negotiated the removal of the fortress-style command post built by the French Concession. On the 24th, the French Consul sent a letter to the municipal government without a concrete response. On the 26th, the municipal government sent another letter reiterating the request for the removal of the command post. The correspondence is recorded as follows: The French Consul's letter stated: "In response to your letter of October 31st regarding the fortress-style command post built in the French Concession, I am pleased to note that you appreciate that this structure was originally established to assist in maintaining security in this port and recognize the efforts of the authorities of this concession. I also believe that Your Honor will easily explain any misunderstandings in order to avoid disputes. Your Honor's letter has been forwarded to the embassy of my country." The municipal government's letter stated: "With reference to your esteemed letter of the 24th of this month regarding the fortress-style command post built in the French Concession to avoid disputes, now that the situation has been stabilized and there are no other security concerns in this port, please maintain the original intention of the authorities of this concession. Please remove the command post immediately to avoid misunderstandings, as stated in the previous letter."</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents Surveying Roads Beyond Borders</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Japanese residents surveying terrain in the Chinese territory of Sanyuanli to the cremation grounds, the municipal government sent a letter to the Japanese Consul in Hankow requesting that he instruct them to cease to prevent misunderstandings. On the 26th, the Japanese Consul replied, stating that there were no plans to build roads beyond the border. The original letter stated: "Regarding the reports in your country's newspapers on the 22nd of this month, titled 'Japanese are plotting to seize land again,' claiming that Japanese were surveying the terrain from Sanyuanli to the cremation grounds on the 18th of this month in preparation for building roads beyond the border, the matter has been investigated by this Consulate. The Hankow Japanese Residents Group, at the request of the Western merchant racetrack, has only been surveying the existing road from Sanyuanli to the Japanese cremation grounds for four days since the 16th of this month. The Sanyuanli police station was notified in advance and requested to provide protection during the survey, which the station understood and provided. The Residents Group has absolutely no plans to build roads in that area." (November 26th)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Plans to Issue Lottery Bonds</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Various legal groups in Liaoning aimed to maintain financial stability in the market. They gathered at the Provincial Education Association to discuss solutions. The association publicly nominated Lu Muting, Director-General of the Official Bank of the Three Eastern Provinces, and Jin Zhezhen, President of the Liaoning Chamber of Commerce, to visit Zang Shiyi, Chairman of the Provincial Government, and suggest issuing lottery bonds worth tens of millions of yuan to aid commerce. The Provincial Government convened a joint meeting of the entire Provincial Committee and leaders of various legal groups. They decided to issue lottery bonds worth 20 million yuan, with a monthly interest rate of 1.2%, paid every four months, with each interest payment being 6%. Real estate was used as collateral, with 70% allocated to goods and agriculture and 30% to merchants. The expected recovery period was two years, and local tyrants and gentry were strictly prohibited from manipulating the market for their own benefit. On the 22nd, this plan was submitted to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, and after approval by the Committee, a telegram will be sent to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang for review and approval.

<h3>Liaoning Province Restricts Insurance Businesses</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning Agricultural and Mining Department noted the increasing prevalence of insurance businesses in recent years. Numerous Chinese and foreign insurance companies are located in the commercial ports of the province. However, many failed to register with local authorities or apply for registration in accordance with the law before establishing themselves. They relied solely on verbal promotions or newspaper advertisements, claiming strong capital and outstanding credit. Ordinary merchants and citizens, easily swayed, often purchased insurance from them. While some claims were compensated as agreed upon, many were rejected with excuses, leading to disputes. Some companies even closed down and fled, leaving no recourse for compensation, harming countless insured merchants and citizens. The department, also responsible for industry and commerce, was responsible for supervising this business. It previously drafted regulations for restriction and submitted them to the Provincial Government Committee for deliberation. The Provincial Government issued an order, approved by the 161st Provincial Committee meeting, instructing compliance. The department has issued orders to comply. The regulations are recorded as follows: (1) All insurance companies established in the province, regardless of whether they are Chinese or foreign, must comply with these regulations in addition to all other laws and regulations. (2) Insurance companies establishing themselves in the provincial capital must first submit an application to the Agricultural and Mining Department for verification and registration. Those in other counties must submit their application through the local authorities for review and approval. Foreign insurance companies must submit their application through their respective consuls to the office of the Special Commissioner stationed in Liaoning for review by the Agricultural and Mining Department, along with a certificate of nationality. Establishment is prohibited without approval. (3) When applying for registration, insurance companies must provide guarantees from two reputable merchants with capital of 50,000 yuan or more. Foreign companies establishing branches may request a guarantee from their respective consuls. (4) The application must detail the name, origin, address, occupation of the applicant, the type of business, the proposed address, and the amount of capital, along with the articles of association for evaluation. (5) The Agricultural and Mining Department will send personnel to verify the capital in the provincial capital. In other counties, the Agricultural and Mining Department may order the competent authority to send personnel to verify and obtain a deposit certificate from the bank. (6) All approved insurance companies must apply to the Agricultural and Mining Department for registration and pay a security deposit of 5,000 yuan within 15 days of approval. Branches must pay half the amount. (7) If an insurance company cannot compensate the insured amount, the Agricultural and Mining Department may withhold all or part of the aforementioned security deposit to compensate the insured party's losses. If the amount is still insufficient, the guarantor is responsible for compensation. If there are no accidents during the company's operation, the company may apply for the return of the deposit at the end of the business. (8) After registration, insurance companies may entrust ordinary merchants to act as agents in the various counties of the province, in addition to establishing branches in accordance with the law, but must have formal authorization documents. The entrusted merchants must have capital of 20,000 yuan or more to be eligible. (9) When entrusting a merchant to act as an agent, the company must submit an application to the Agricultural and Mining Department for filing. Foreign companies must submit their application through their respective consuls to the office of the Special Commissioner stationed in Liaoning for review by the Agricultural and Mining Department. If a merchant submits the application on their own, they must attach the company's authorization documents. A processing fee of ten yuan must be paid with each application. (10) Insurance companies, whether headquarters, branches, or agencies, must submit all accounting reports to the Agricultural and Mining Department for review at the end of each accounting period.

(12) Insurance companies that have already registered before the implementation of these regulations must pay the security deposit within six months of the implementation of these regulations. (13) Those who violate the provisions of Articles 2, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 13 may be prohibited from operating or fined up to one thousand yuan by the Agricultural and Mining Department or the competent local authority, depending on the circumstances. (14) These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any outstanding matters. (15) These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Provincial Government Committee meeting. (November 26th)</p>
<h3>Details of the Shooting of a Chinese by Japanese Soldiers in Fengcheng</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The local authorities have instructed the diplomatic office to negotiate vigorously regarding the case of the Japanese garrison shooting a Chinese in Xigou Village, Fengcheng. The Shenyang Diplomatic Association sent a letter to the Fengcheng County Government to investigate the details of the incident in order to gather evidence and understand the truth. The county government replied yesterday with the following: "Upon receiving your esteemed letter, we immediately ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate the matter. According to the report submitted by Ao Shizhang, Chief of the First Branch Bureau, on the morning of October 4th, at approximately 9:00 AM, Chen Fangxiang, the village head of Chengxigou Village, reported that a male corpse was found near the South Bridge Cave of the Japanese Railway. We immediately went to investigate. However, several members of the Japanese garrison were guarding the area and refused to allow us to proceed. The Branch Bureau Chief, upon hearing this, took the village head and police to the scene for inspection. The county secretary, Japanese garrison police, county soldiers, and others had already arrived. We learned that the deceased villager was Liu Decai, a resident of Chengxigou Village. He was lying face up within the Japanese railway property, wearing a blue cotton jacket and pants and rubber shoes. Next to him was a small wooden stick about two feet long. There was a knife wound on the outside of his right arm, two knife wounds on the outside of his right armpit, a large area of scraped knife wounds on his back, and a bullet wound on his left posterior rib. It was confirmed that he had been shot and killed by the Japanese. A sketch was drawn, and with the cooperation of the Japanese police, the body was moved outside the railway property and properly guarded for examination. We hereby submit the sketch for your examination." "Based on this, we requested the branch court prosecutor to send personnel to examine the body. They replied that the deceased Liu Decai had been stabbed with a bayonet and then shot, resulting in death. We have enclosed the examination report for your review." "The County Chief, still concerned about the truth, ordered Ao Shizhang to investigate further. According to Liu Wang, the deceased's wife, who lives east of the railway bridge cave, more than 100 steps away from the railway, her husband Liu Decai was employed by Ai Dequan at Ai Jiabaozi, west of the bridge cave. Ai Jiabaozi is only two li away from her home, and he often returned home. On the evening of October 3rd, at about 7:00 PM, she suddenly heard cries for help west of the railway bridge for about ten minutes, followed by gunshots. The next morning, she learned that her husband had been shot and killed by the Japanese soldiers. According to Ai Dequan, Liu Decai was employed at his home and had dinner there on the evening of October 3rd. He then went to his father-in-law, Wang Jingui's house, empty-handed to get flour to prepare for the festival before returning home. Wang Jingui stated that Liu Decai did not have a gun or wooden stick when he came to his house. The statements of Ai Dequan and Wang Jingui are generally consistent. According to Zi Changxiang, a resident west of the bridge cave, about half a li away from the bridge cave, at 7:30 PM on the evening of October 3rd, he suddenly heard someone shouting for help. He went out to investigate and saw a Chinese being chased and captured by Japanese soldiers and dragged towards the bridge cave. He was afraid of the Japanese soldiers and did not dare to help. About ten minutes later, he heard gunshots, and then silence. The Japanese garrison soldier Kawashima stated that at 7:30 PM on the evening of October 3rd, before the southbound train arrived, he suddenly heard the sound of stones being placed on the railway bridge in the West River. He patrolled along the road to the south end of the bridge and saw a large stone on the tracks. The deceased Chinese was running down from the tracks. He chased after him. The Chinese resisted arrest with a wooden stick in his hand. He used his gun to defend himself. Unable to withstand the resistance, he shot and killed him. The knife wounds on the Chinese were caused when he blocked the Chinese's stick attacks with his gun, which was struck by a knife. We have enclosed his signed statement, sketch, and record for your report." "The County Chief has further investigated and found that Liu Decai was a local resident who had lived near the railway for many years. He was well aware of the strict precautions taken by the Japanese along the railway. Placing stones on the tracks would not only endanger himself but also his family. Even foolish villagers would not risk their lives and families for such a trivial matter. As for the Japanese claim that he resisted arrest with a wooden stick, Ai Dequan stated that he was empty-handed, and Wang Jingui did not see him holding a wooden stick. Even if he had a small stick, it would not be able to withstand the powerful gun. Although it was dark at the time, and there were no other witnesses, nearby villagers heard his cries for help, which suggests that he was unable to resist and died after exerting all his strength to shout for help and being shot. Liu Decai was too busy trying to escape to resist arrest or to defend himself. Now, his family has come to the county, wailing and demanding compensation. The County Chief is trying to comfort them while informing residents along the railway and passersby not to enter the railway cordon without authorization to avoid danger. In addition to submitting separate letters for serious negotiation, we have enclosed copies of the examination report, sketch, signed statement, and record for your review." (November 26th)</p>
<p>The Case of a Judge of the Eastern Special Court Killing for Money</p>
<h3>Judge Ye Yixiong Escapes to Ping with a Concubine</h3>
<p>Lies and Deceives Her to Disembark Mid-Journey, Shoots and Kills Her</p>
<p>Ye is Apprehended by Railway Police and Sent to Harbin for Trial</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The darkness of the Northeast judiciary is most evident in Jilin and Heilongjiang. The Special Region handles many cases involving foreigners, and many legal professionals uphold their integrity. In recent years, foreign visitors to Harbin have praised the judiciary. However, a shocking case has recently occurred in the Special Region's legal circles involving Judge Ye Yixiong plotting to murder a widow for her money, causing public outrage. The murdered widow, Zhang Lizhen, was 31 years old and from Beiping. Her husband, Zhang Ziming, was an engineer in the third district of the Harbin Long-Distance Telephone Bureau. Several years ago, he met Lizhen in Liuxiang and arranged for her to be removed from the registry to become his concubine. Zhang passed away last year due to illness, leaving behind more than 10,000 yuan in savings and shares in the Xie Xingnan Sauce Garden. Lizhen, being young and widowed, found it difficult to live alone. She began a secret affair with Ye Yixiong, a judge in the summary court of the Eastern Special Local Court, who had been her client in the past. Ye was 34 years old and from Minhou, Fujian. He was known for his womanizing and was already married to Peng Churi, from Hubei, with whom he had children, who currently reside at No. 17, 14th Street, Daoli, Harbin. However, Ye did not often stay at home, spending most of his time either at Lizhen's place or with prostitutes. His extravagant spending habits led to mounting debts. Recently, Lizhen wanted to return to her hometown in Beiping and had remitted her late husband's savings to Beiping, a draft worth 7,050 yuan in silver, which she carried with her for convenience during her travels. As Ye was her lover, she did not hide anything from him and told him everything. Ye, harboring malicious intentions, falsely told Lizhen that he also wanted to go to Beiping to handle personal matters and travel, asking her to accompany him. Lizhen did not suspect anything. On the evening of the 23rd, at 10:45 PM, they boarded the third passenger train south from Harbin, each purchasing a second-class sleeper seat. On the train, Ye feigned intimacy and learned that Lizhen had her draft and seal with her. After 12:00 AM, when the train arrived at Shuangchengpu Station, south of Harbin, which was scheduled to stop for more than ten minutes, Ye falsely claimed that the train would stop for an hour and insisted that Lizhen disembark with him to have tea in the dining hall. Lizhen initially refused, but Ye repeatedly urged her, and Lizhen could not refuse, so she disembarked with him. After disembarking, Ye led Lizhen to the back of a freight warehouse next to the station. Seeing that no one was around, he tripped Lizhen, causing her to fall to the ground. At the same time, he pulled out a handgun and shot Lizhen in the back. Thinking that he had finished the job, he searched Lizhen's body for the draft and seal, threw the gun into the wild, and fled to a hotel in the city. Unexpectedly, the bullet entered Lizhen's back and lodged in her lower abdomen without exiting. She fainted for a short time and then regained consciousness and groaned. A patrolling railway policeman found her and carried her into the station. After regaining some composure, Lizhen recounted Ye's murder attempt in detail. The railway police, seeing that her injuries were severe, arranged for her to be transported to Harbin on a small ticket train at 6:15 AM on the 24th and admitted to the Central Hospital for treatment. At noon, the doctor removed the bullet, resulting in significant blood loss, and she fell into a coma. The doctor said her life was in danger. Upon hearing the news on the afternoon of the 24th, the Special Court first dismissed Ye from his position as judge and telegraphed the Changchun Railway Medical Section to send him back for trial. At 1:00 PM, Prosecutor Wang Ke and Secretary Wang Demao were dispatched to the hospital to take Lizhen's statement, but the doctor forbade them from speaking to her, so they instead obtained the facts from the first section of the railway police. Ye Yixiong spent the night in Shuangcheng and arrived at the station at 7:10 AM on the 24th to purchase a ticket back to Harbin. The railway police, seeing that his clothing and appearance matched Lizhen's description, questioned him. Ye panicked and spoke incoherently, and he was arrested at the police station. Zhang Lizhen's seal, draft, and Ye's official business card were found on his person, confirming that he was the culprit. As the area was under the jurisdiction of the sixth section of the Changchun Railway Police, he was transferred to the Changchun General Section and scheduled to be sent to Harbin early yesterday morning. The case will be investigated by the Special Court and then sent to the Binjiang Court for handling. (November 24th)</p>
<p>Continued Investigation: The Sixth Section of the Changchun Railway Police sent two patrol officers, Chang and Ma, and two police officers with the ninth passenger train and the railway bureau's funds transport car, escorting Ye Yixiong to Harbin at 8:00 AM this (25th) morning. He was immediately sent to the Railway Police Department. At 10:00 AM, Yang, a section member of the third section of the Railway Police Department, briefly interrogated him and then detained him. He will be sent to the Special District Local Court in the next day or two. Ye laid down in the train car immediately after boarding in Changchun, feigning sleep, but frequently turned over, appearing unable to overcome his remorse. The Changchun Railway Police Section, due to the seriousness of the case, secured him with shackles and assigned patrol officers to guard him in shifts during the journey. When he arrived at the Harbin station this morning, the railway police first transported Zhang Lizhen's belongings, five leather suitcases, in a car. Then, they helped Ye off the train. Ye wore a blue woolen Western-style coat with the collar turned up, his head retracted. He wore a black sheared velvet Turkish-style fur hat and had a pale face. He stood at the train door, looking around with a very desolate expression. After boarding the car, he tried to pull his hat down tightly, using his collar to cover his face. However, his twitching lips and the pupils of his eyes visible outside his collar revealed that he was still cunningly watching people. During his statement at the Changchun Railway Police Section, Ye claimed that Zhang Lizhen was a friend's wife and that he was entrusted to take care of her when her husband was on his deathbed. Because she was alone and returning home, he was asked to accompany her. When the train arrived at Shuangchengpu, he disembarked with her to get some fresh air. Because he feared encountering bandits, he carried a gun for self-defense. Unexpectedly, when the train suddenly started moving, he tripped over Zhang, causing her to fall, and the gun went off accidentally, injuring Lizhen. When asked why he did not report to the police after the accident, which could have reduced his punishment, and why he fled and took the draft and seal, he lowered his head and did not answer. After the Shuangchengpu railway police apprehended Ye, they found Zhang Lizhen's seal, gold watch, and 500 yuan in Tianjin currency. However, the 7,050 yuan draft was missing. After searching for a long time, it was finally found at the bottom of his Western suit pant leg. The Special Court held a meeting last night to discuss the matter. Because the case was serious, a temporary investigation court was specially formed to investigate it before sending it directly to the Northeast Supreme Court in Liaoning to avoid the Binjiang Court from protecting the defendant due to being of the same level. The condition of the injured Zhang Lizhen has not changed, and her life may not be in danger. (November 25th)</p>
<p>The Hulan-Hailun Railway is Changed to Commercial Operation</p>
<h3>Total Shares Valued at 14 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The business of the Hulan-Hailun Railway has been extremely prosperous in recent years. However, Heilongjiang Province's treasury has been depleted since the defense against Russia last year, causing all construction projects throughout the province to be unable to proceed due to a shortage of funds. The Guangxin Official Bank, the province's agent treasury, also suffers from a lack of funds, causing the banknotes it issues to repeatedly depreciate in value. The Qiqihar-Keshan Railway and the extension of the Hulan-Hailun Railway to Hegang cannot be built due to lack of funds (the Qiqihar-Keshan Railway has only been built to Ningnian). The Provincial Government previously decided that the province had invested heavily in the Hulan-Hailun Railway. If the Hulan-Hailun Railway were changed to commercial operation and commercial shares were raised to replace official funds, the province could use its financial resources for various construction projects. It was submitted to the Northeast Political and Transportation Committee for approval. It was approved and ordered to be implemented as proposed. The Hulan-Hailun Railway will be reorganized into the Hulan-Hailun Railway Company and formally established on December 1st. Gao Yunkun, the current director, will be appointed as the General Manager, and Wan Guobin, the Director of the Qiqihar-Angxi Railway Bureau, will be appointed as the Deputy General Manager. The General Manager will be stationed in the province, and the Deputy General Manager will be stationed permanently in the company. Wan Guobin took office as Deputy General Manager at the company in Songpu Town on the 20th of this month and immediately began raising commercial shares. The methods are as follows: (1) The railway, from Majiachuan Wharf in Hulan to the outer city of Hailun, will be designated as a limited liability company. (2) The company's total share capital is tentatively set at 14 million yuan in silver dollars. Official and commercial parties will be responsible for raising shares. If there are excess shares, they will be commercially managed. (3) The company's total shares are 280,000 shares, each share costing 50 yuan. Only citizens of the Republic of China can invest in shares. (4) The company's registered shares are divided into three types: 100-share certificates worth 5,000 yuan, 10-share certificates worth 500 yuan, and 1-share certificates worth 50 yuan. (5) The company designates the Heilongjiang Provincial Bank as the institution for collecting share capital. It will immediately issue certificates, and formal stock certificates will be exchanged after the fourth installment of share capital has been collected. (6) Share capital will be paid in four installments, which will be approved by the Transportation Committee and the Heilongjiang Provincial Government (the dates have not yet been determined). (7) Interest will be paid at the rate of 6% per annum from the date the share capital is paid. (8) If the company needs to increase share capital, it will be added through a shareholders' meeting. (9) The company will have 11 directors and 3 supervisors. Commercial shareholders will have directors and supervisors in proportion to the number of shares they hold. Official directors and supervisors will be appointed by the Provincial Government. Commercial directors and supervisors will be elected by the shareholders. (10) Commercial shareholders who are over 25 years old, of good character, well-educated, and hold 1,000 shares are qualified to be elected as directors. Those who hold 500 shares are qualified to be elected as supervisors. (11) When commercial shares increase by 1 million yuan and official shares decrease accordingly, the number of official directors and supervisors will be reduced by one, and commercial shareholders will be selected to fill the vacancy. (12) If a stock certificate is lost, the owner must provide a detailed explanation and obtain a confirmation from two or more company shareholders as witnesses. The company will publish an advertisement to invalidate the certificate. If no other circumstances arise after three months, a new certificate will be issued. (13) If a shareholder wants to transfer shares, they must provide a detailed explanation and submit the old stock certificate for transfer. However, transfers will be suspended 30 days before each general meeting. (14) The company's stock certificates cannot be sold to foreigners at any time. Even private transfers will be invalid. (15) If several people jointly purchase a share, one person will be designated as the shareholder. (16) The company's stock certificates are securities with value and can be mortgaged at banks to obtain loans. (17) The company's articles of association can be amended at any time if they are incomplete. (18) The company's articles of association will be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The county police team has dispatched personnel to Hougang Benyi, Punan Hougang Town, which is located at the intersection of Songjiang and Jinshan counties, reaching Songyin in Jinshan to the north and connecting Zhangdi in Jinshan to the south via the Huangpu River. The terrain of Songzhi Dianshan Mapeng is important. Six times this year, a kidnapping case occurred involving the wealthy Wang family, with the bandits acting brazenly as if they were in an uninhabited area, causing considerable concern among the locals. Now, during the winter defense period, Magistrate Jin is concerned that there may still be unrest in the area, so he has specially dispatched the second platoon of the police team to be stationed there to deter crime and to order them to concurrently serve as guerrillas in the event of nearby bandit activity.</p>
<p>The East Outer Bridge Road has begun repairs. The roads and bridges in the city have been gradually repaired by the First District Office and are now relatively smooth. However, the main street outside the East Gate is still uneven and difficult to travel, and the two Huan Tong Bridge and Small Stone Bridge that lead to the Mingxing Bridge train station have yet to be leveled, making it inconvenient for streetcars and travelers. At the request of local people, the District Office is planning to repair them and work started yesterday. However, the project is quite large, so local people have donated funds in turn, and it is expected to be completed by the end of next month. In addition, the Ma Ya Bridge and Qihang Bridge, which are important hubs for access to Sijing and other places, have a high volume of pedestrian traffic, but they are dangerous due to years of disrepair. Wu Juchi, the head of the East Outer Town, has initiated a project to repair them and has sent a letter to the District Office for filing and approval of funding assistance.</p>

<p>Bandits discovered at a performing arts venue. Yesterday afternoon (28th), in Nantan, Xiannv Temple in the county, performers from the Lixiahe area set up a cloth circle to perform martial arts, attracting a large crowd of spectators. Suddenly, Liang Zhengbang, a police officer from the Water Public Security Team stationed in the area, saw bandits who had previously robbed a ship at Zhaoguan Dam. He immediately stepped forward to question them, but the bandits, feeling guilty, fired two shots from a pistol. Fortunately, they missed. The Water and Land Public Security and the business community sent teams to round up the bandits, but they had already escaped without a trace. Recently, forty people speaking in northern accents have suddenly appeared in the Yiling area of the county. They carry weapons, beat gongs and drums, and set up a venue to perform, causing the villagers to fear that their large numbers might lead to a disaster similar to the Xiannv Temple bandits. The district party headquarters and the agricultural association jointly sent a telegram to the county government requesting that it be stopped. It is reported that the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau yesterday to find a way to expel them from the territory to protect public security.</p>

<p>Chenxi Highway North Section Project Borrowing 60,000 yuan. Since Mao Feng, the director of the Construction Bureau, took office, he has actively started construction of bridges and culverts on the northern section of the Chenxi Highway. However, the total cost of the entire section is more than 90,000 yuan. In addition to the 10,000 yuan previously borrowed from the automobile company and the 20,000 yuan collected, which have already been used up, there is still a shortage of more than 60,000 yuan. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, County Magistrate Li, together with Mao Feng, the director of the Construction Bureau, convened a tea party with local gentry and representatives of various Qian Zhuang (money shops) to discuss borrowing money. It was decided that the Finance Bureau and Mei Shou would be responsible for borrowing 10,000 yuan. Wu Shuying, Long Yin, Chen Zhongda, and Wang Yiyun would borrow 10,000 yuan from Huachang and Zhonghua Coal Companies using the yarn factory's supervision warehouse. Another 10,000 yuan would be borrowed from various Qian Zhuang, totaling 30,000 yuan. Half of this amount will be paid by November 20, and the full amount will be paid by the end of the month. It is planned to continue borrowing 10,000 yuan from the automobile company (the above interest is borrowed using the road construction Mu (acre) tax as collateral). The various items of Mu (acre) tax revenue are estimated to total 10,000 yuan, bringing the total to 60,000 yuan. According to Director Mao Jian, the entire road is expected to be completed within six months, and the entire road is expected to be open to traffic by next spring.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>A Small Kidnapping Victim Rescued Midway. Yu Long, the first squad leader of the first company of the railway police stationed in Linze, a county town, led his squad on patrol that night. Suddenly, he saw electric light on the east side of the town and went to investigate. He learned that bandits were passing by and opened fire to pursue them. The bandits returned fire and fled east, leaving behind a kidnapping victim. He was taken back to the squad for questioning and said that he was the eldest grandson of Zhang Fengyi from Jishuigou, with the nickname Xiangrui, and was ten years old. Squad Leader Yu sent the kidnapping victim to the brigade headquarters last night (27th) to be transferred to the county government to notify the family to identify him.</p>
<p>Xingyou (Xinghua-Gaoyou) Helper Boat Robbed Again. The Xingyou Helper Boat set off from Xinghua to Gaoyou the day before yesterday.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>A Fishing Boat Robbed in Taihe Town. Shen's fishing boat was anchored at the Erbai Ferry in Taihe Town, Phoenix District, in this county. The boat was inhabited by many men and women who depended on raising ducks for a living. In recent years, their livelihood had been good and they had accumulated some savings. The day before yesterday (27th), many bandits suddenly arrived in several small boats and searched Shen's boat. At that time, only two women were left on the boat, and the rest had gone out to work. The bandits first tied up the two women and then began to search. As a result, they robbed more than 700 silver dollars, two gold rings, one silver bracelet, five cotton blankets, and dozens of ducks. After the robbery, they sailed away into the lake. Afterward, Shen reported the robbery to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>The Western Town of the Mountain is Startled Several Times in One Night. The Western Town of the Mountain has suffered two robberies and kidnapping cases in the recent month, and there has been no news to date. As a result, the residents of the town have been extremely panicked recently, with the feeling of "wind noise and crane crying". On the night before yesterday, when the water and land police were secretly posting sentries, they suddenly discovered a ship in the sea that was sailing and stopping, lingering near the Siyang Town, with suspicious behavior. The sentries reported back to the team and then used the telephone to inform Li Zhan Kui, the captain of the Mountain Team, to gather all the patrolmen and set off to the West Yang in the middle of the night. The ship, knowing that there was preparation, turned its sails and escaped. Fortunately, there was no accident, but it caused great panic among the residents, and some even moved overnight, causing unusual chaos. A young woman uses clever tricks to deceive others. A woman has suddenly appeared in the city of this county, defrauding silver dollars and objects from major households. The day before yesterday, when she went to the home of Zou Sicheng, the director of the Nong Yang office in Gejia Lane, there were only a few women in the Zou family. The woman claimed to be Xu from Zhejiang, 23 years old, and a graduate of Qinghua University. She said that she had been introduced to work as a secretary in the county government. Her brother had studied with Zou Sicheng's brother, Si Lian, at Jiaotong University and they had been in frequent contact. Therefore, she had come to visit after arriving in Chang. Because her speech was clear and her dress was modern, the Zou women did not suspect anything and invited her to have tea and refreshments. After talking for a long time, the woman took Zou to a remote place and said that she had brought little money for the trip and that it was inconvenient for the county government to advance her salary. She said that she was feeling weak and needed to take some medicine, so she asked to borrow five yuan temporarily and would return it on Sunday. Zou agreed and the woman took the money and left. Then she went to Wang Yunpeng's house in Dongshan Tang Jing'an (Wang Zishun is currently studying at Jiaotong University) and said, "I am familiar with your son and my uncle is a secretary in the county government. I came from Shanghai this time and will return tomorrow. Shunan asked me to bring his clothes." However, Wang suspected that it was a scam, so he went to the county government to inquire. He was firmly answered that there was no secretary named Xu. The woman, knowing that she was about to be exposed, left.

<h3>Ministry of Education Collects Teaching Materials for Overseas Chinese Schools</h3>

<p>Su Severely Punishes Jiangning and Taixing Finance Bureau Chiefs</p>
<h3>For Disregarding Education Funds</h3>
<p>Jiangning Dismissed, Taixing Recorded a Demerit: The Jiangsu Provincial Government, according to the Finance Department's reply to the Education Fund Management Office, requested that Huang Shoushan, the chief of the Jiangning Finance Bureau, and Tan Xiangqing, the chief of the Taixing Finance Bureau, be punished for misconduct. The 351st meeting of the Provincial Government Committee on November 25 decided to approve the request. The original report from the Finance Department stated that, in addition to the Jiangning Finance Bureau Chief Huang Shoushan being proposed for dismissal due to ineffective collection, the former Yixing Finance Bureau Chief Tan Xiangqing, who was then the Taixing Finance Bureau Chief, had misappropriated more than 32,200 yuan of special provincial education funds during his tenure in Yixing. After being transferred to Taixing, he accumulated arrears for more than seven months. Although the misappropriation was for public purposes and could be considered justifiable, the ineffective collection and failure to return the funds early were also inexcusable. It is proposed that the bureau chief be given a major demerit to show punishment and warning. At the same time, he is still ordered to earnestly urge the collection of new and old taxes, and to remit them monthly after collection. He is also ordered to propose a plan for the rapid return of the previous old debts and submit it for approval in order to prioritize education funds.</p>

<p>Zhang Zhizhong, the director of education of the Central Military Academy and concurrently the commander of the Second Teaching Division, had previously requested Chiang Kai-shek, the president of the school, to approve his resignation from the concurrent position of division commander so that he could devote himself to the school affairs.

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Cai Yuanpei Discusses the Issue of the Principal of China Public School</h3>
<p>A new principal is being sought</p>
<p>Gao Yihan resigns from all positions</p>
<p>(National News Agency) A report on the 28th stated that Ma Junwu was still the principal of China Public School and was planning the next semester's program. After the news spread, the students of the school were all surprised and discussed it. The League of Students, fearing that the whole student body would misunderstand and lead to tragedy, sent representatives to inquire about the truth from all sides. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the representatives of the League of Students visited Chairman Cai at his private residence on Route Jisi Fei Er and had a three-hour conversation. The following is a transcript of the conversation:</p>
<p>Cai's Remarks (Representative asked) It was reported the other day that Mr. Cai personally went to Mr. Ma Junwu's private residence on Kunming Road to urge him to return to school to work. Is this true? Cai (replied) I have been to Mr. Ma's house, but it was to explain the reasons why the board of directors approved his resignation this time, not to urge him to return to school to work. (Asked) Does the board of directors maintain the original proposal? (Answered) The resolution of the board of directors will certainly be maintained. There is no such thing as making a resolution and then overturning it. (Asked) Now that the board of directors has approved Mr. Ma's resignation and appointed Mr. Yu to succeed him, then in theory and in fact, Mr. Yu should be in charge of China Public School. In addition, Mr. Yu has already arrived at China Public School and formally announced the maintenance of order. Why is it that Ma Junwu still uses the title of principal to issue announcements, and the representative group is widely publicizing that Principal Ma has returned to his post? What is going on? (Answered) What the representative group says and does can be taken into account, so what is the point of having a board of directors? Mr. Ma's going to school was his own decision, and it was also a matter of course before he handed over his responsibilities. (Asked) Why is the representative group interfering in school administration, sometimes expelling a teacher and sometimes expelling an employee, causing a stir in the city? Is this correct? (Answered) The school authorities should bear full responsibility. The representatives should immediately urge Principal Yu to come to the school to take charge. Cai (replied) Of course, we would be very happy if Mr. Yu could come, but Mr. Yu cannot spare time for national affairs. We are looking for a new principal, but we have not found one yet. It is a very good thing that you have always avoided conflicts and cared for the school. The board of directors fully understands this. However, after you go back today, you should still persuade the students to study in peace. You can ignore the issue of the board of directors meeting.</p>
<p>Gao Yihan Resigns. Since Mr. Gao Yihan established the Academy of Social Sciences at China Public School, the name of social science at China Public School has become famous for a time, and it has enjoyed a high reputation among the universities in Shanghai. The students also have extraordinary faith in him. At the beginning of this semester, Mr. Ma was slow to issue Mr. Gao's letter of appointment, and the students actually questioned him and requested it repeatedly. Mr. Gao was also extraordinarily close to the general students, so the relationship between teachers and students was very harmonious. However, after this student unrest occurred, the students of the representative group actually issued a threatening warning letter to Mr. Gao. Mr. Gao immediately sent a letter to the board of directors to resign from all positions and left gracefully. We have specially found Mr. Gao's letter of resignation to the board of directors:</p>
<p>To Mr. Zimin and the Board of Directors for your kind review: Yihan has long been determined to sever all relations with the board of directors, president, and professors of China Public School. However, because the issue of the principal has not been settled, it has been delayed until now. Now, I hereby submit a letter to clarify that the board of directors approves my resignation from the position of director of China Public School, and I also ask the board of directors to inform the new principal to approve my resignation from the position of president and professor. This is all I have to report. I wish you good health. Gao Yihan, November 22nd.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Railways Allocates More Than 400,000 Yuan to Build the Engineering Hall of Jiaotong University</h3>
<p>Since Jiaotong University was placed under the administration of the Ministry of Railways, it has been making every effort to develop it. In order to emphasize engineering and focus on experimentation, it was decided to build a large-scale engineering hall, which is estimated to cost more than 400,000 yuan.

A national anti-drug speech contest is held every year. This city is responsible for the preparations by the education section of our association. The colleges and universities have already been held yesterday at the YMCA. The actors participating were very enthusiastic. This is really a good phenomenon for the anti-drug movement. This time, all parties have provided a lot of support to create this unprecedentedly grand meeting. Today, there are too many people participating in the elementary school group, so it is held here to eliminate the scourge of morphine tablets. The student community should be responsible for this. Today's international status is precarious due to the scourge of opium. Students are the future masters of society and the country. They must unite and work hard against this substance that destroys the country and exterminates the race in order to achieve the goal of eliminating the scourge of drugs. Next, the students began their speeches, each showing their strengths, eloquently and enthusiastically, which was a great event. The meeting ended at 12:00 PM. The judges appointed by the association, Yang Xizhen, Master of Arts, principal of Zhongxi Girls' School, Ma Canhan, Master of Arts, professor of Daxia University, Jin Wuzhou, Doctor of Philosophy, executive director of Puyi Society, Chen Binghuang, Master of Arts, of the China Student Magazine, Bai Zhiying, Doctor of Philosophy, and Chen Hongjun, executive officer of the General Affairs Section of the China National Anti-Drug Association, etc., determined the first place in the elementary school group to be Tang Dun of Xicheng Elementary School, titled "The Enemy of Anti-Drug"; the second place to be Zhong Liansheng of Shihua Elementary School, titled "Banning Opium to Save the Country"; the third place to be Tang Wenyu of Wanzhu Elementary School, titled "How Should We Fight Drugs"; the fourth place to be Lin Yongquan of Pudong Elementary School, titled "The Key Points of Anti-Drug"; and the fifth place to be Zuo Yongbao of Derun Elementary School, titled "Personal Anti-Drug."

The sound of applause was like thunder. Finally, anti-drug films and silent educational films specially provided by Da Guangming were shown to help the fun. It is heard that the association is preparing for a national student essay contest after the end of the speech contest.</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Cultivates Shipping Talents</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is the only shipping organization in China. Since the National Government nationalized the company, the director-general, Mr. Li Zhonggong, has actively reorganized and managed it, leaving no stone unturned. Important tasks such as returning commercial shares, revitalizing the company's affairs, adding ships, expanding overseas routes, and reorganizing inland river routes are all being implemented step by step with detailed plans, as reported in the newspapers. It is recently heard that the company believes that there is a shortage of talent in China's shipping industry, and the development of the shipping industry in the future will inevitably rely on foreign experts. Therefore, the company is making every effort to expand the shipping specialist department of the China Merchants Public School, which is run by the company. In addition to the original two classes of navigation, one class of marine engineering, one class of navigation, and one class of business, a total of 180 new students will be recruited. Registration is scheduled to begin on December 10 this year at the China Merchants Public School on Huade Road, Tilanqiao, in this city.

<h3>Zhenru Unfortunately Loses</h3>
<p>Lost to Western Captives Two to Three</p>
<p>The Stott Cup Has Been Eliminated</p>
<p>Zhenru's Football Skills, Although Defeated, Are Still Glorious</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhenru and Western Captives played in Yishui for the Stott Cup. In the second half, they were still able to overwhelm Western Captives with a score of two to zero. The spectators around were all happy. However, unexpectedly, in the last fifteen minutes of the game, the luck of Western Captives turned, and three goals were scored, reversing the victory. From then on, Zhenru has entered the elimination round of the Stott Cup.</p>
<h3>One Misstep Becomes Eternal Regret</h3>
<p>We cannot judge heroes by victory or defeat. Yesterday's Zhenru was even more brilliant than before. We cannot bury its art because of its failure. Zhenru accounted for 60% to 70% of the entire 90 minutes. What is regrettable is that the misstep of 15 minutes has become an eternal regret. It is almost impossible to change the strategy and slightly change the formation. Chen Zhenhe personally listed the front line to join the entire army in the final struggle, trying to reverse the situation and show the spirit of our nation. However, bad luck was at the head, and several counterattacks became smoke. As a result, the Zhenru, which was strong in momentum and strong in strength for a time, was relegated to the bottom with a score of two to three. The referee was Graham.</p>
<h3>Showing Off Their Skills on the Green Field</h3>
<p>Since the rise of Zhenru's athletes in the Shanghai football world, the Shanghai fans have followed wherever their banner has been raised. On that day, Yishui's arena became a grand occasion for a time. It rained lightly in the morning, but fortunately it stopped soon, and the slightly wet field did not hinder the battle. The bell rang three times, the sound of the silver box rang, and the Chinese and Western athletes responded to the battle. Showing off their skills on the green field, Western Captives used their divine power to attack first, and Turner sent a long ball. Liang Guanlian stepped forward to receive it, and David rushed to defend. The goalkeeper fell to the ground, and Jack rushed to save the goal. The goalkeeper held on tightly and finally escaped the danger. The inside of Zhenru was like a golden city and iron wall from then on. It was difficult for the enemy to penetrate deeply, but they could only attack from a distance.</p>
<h3>Center Forward Dai Sweeps the Head to Make the First Contribution</h3>
<p>The mistake of Western Captives' inner guard, Shigaotu, almost ruined the event. Chen Bingxiang took advantage of this to quickly pass the ball, and Fu Hexuan's shot in front of the goal hit the goalkeeper directly, otherwise it would have been disastrous. After Western Captives escaped the danger, the army besieged and forced a corner kick. A ball flew over, and Turner headed it diagonally, hitting the wooden post. Turner picked it up again, and the goalkeeper caught it and fell again. Fortunately, Chen Zhenhe retreated to the rear to prevent it from happening. Soon, Western Captives misunderstood each other, and center forward Dai remotely passed the ball to the left. The left winger Fu Hexuan added a kick, and the goalkeeper hit him, catching it and escaping the danger. At that time, the military situation of Zhenru was very terrible. Western Captives seemed to be living in a storm. Left forward He Lei took care of both sides, and his contribution was great. In the first two minutes of the first half, Chen Zhenhe passed the ball to Chen Jiaqiu, and then passed it to the front of the goal. Goalkeeper Boshi panicked and lost it. Dai Linjing took a light ride and swept into the gate, winning the first contribution. Zhenru took the lead with one to zero in the first half.</p>
<h3>Luo Haiguang's Kick Amazes Everyone</h3>
<p>The army fought again, and Zhenru's energy was still strong. The enemy often had internal chaos, creating a dangerous situation. Zhenru took advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of the opportunity. Among the five forwards, Luo Haiguang made his debut for the first time yesterday. His skills were agile and attracted much attention from the audience. At 14 minutes, left winger Chen Bingxiang passed the ball, and Luo Haiguang used his agile foot to touch it successfully, causing the audience to cheer.</p>
<h3>Fifteen Minutes Cast a Big Mistake</h3>
<p>Zhenru had two goals after experiencing a difficult victory. However, due to Fu Hexuan's foul, a free kick was awarded. The ground was about 35 yards away from the gate. A ball was sent in, and center-back Ge Xu stood tall and headed it into the gate. Western Captives won back a goal, and their momentum suddenly rose. They always lingered in front of Zhenru's gate. Turner kicked back and shot the center forward David, and the score was tied at two to two. Soon, Turner shot hard at 40 yards, and the goalkeeper jumped up a little late and was already in the net. The loss of three goals took 15 minutes, and the speed of the change was really unexpected. The maker of the big mistake could not shirk his responsibility.</p>
<h3>Zhenru's Athletes, Although Defeated, Are Still Glorious</h3>
<p>Zhenru won and lost again, and their hearts were not reconciled. They changed their lineup and tried to recover. Chen Zhenhe took over as the left inner, Zhuang Shihong was transferred to the center back, and Chen Jiaqiu replaced Zhuang's position. Western Captives' dragon gate became the target of everyone. Chen Bingxiang picked up the ball, and the two sides fought for each other. The goalkeeper could not return, and Fu Hexuan shot at the door, but Shigaotu headed the ball out. The ball was picked up again, and the goalkeeper rushed out three feet to save the ball. However, the dangerous phenomenon still existed, and it was not difficult to break through at any time. When the final whistle suddenly sounded, Western Captives were able to win Zhenru with three to two.</p>

<h3>The Navy Wins Lux Two to One</h3>
<p>A Scene From the Advanced Cup Preliminary</p>
<p>Lax had defeated the Navy by a score of eleven to one in the Group A competition before, so they were arrogant. Yesterday, they reunited with the Navy at the Western Captives Field for the Advanced Cup Preliminary. Out of the blue, the Navy defeated Lax by a score of two to one.

<h3>Chairman Jiang Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Asks About the Illness of Madam Soong</p>
<p>Will Return to Nanjing and Then to Jiangxi in a Few Days</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui Will Go to Assist in Suppressing the Communists. Chairman Jiang and his wife of the National Government arrived in Shanghai by night express train from Nanjing at 7:20 AM yesterday. Those traveling with him included Guard Captain Wang Shihe, Adjutant Jiang Fushou, and four guards. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Station Arrangement</h3>
<p>Chairman Jiang and his wife notified the Nanjing station late the night before last at 10:50 PM to prepare a car to come to Shanghai. A PCA flower car was attached to the Nanjing-Shanghai night express train. Due to the urgency of time, it was delayed until 11:20 PM before it departed, so it arrived 20 minutes late from the scheduled time of 7:00 AM yesterday morning. The left and right sides of the station were protected by military police sent by the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Garrison Command. The military band of the Public Security Bureau also arrived at the station to welcome them.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Personnel</h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang arrived at the station at about 6:00 AM yesterday morning to welcome them. Soon, Minister Kong Xiangxi and Commander Xiong Shihui also arrived one after another. After Chairman Jiang and his wife got off the train, they shook hands with the welcomers one by one and then took a car to Madam Soong's residence on Seymour Road to rest. Cao Haosen and Ye Zhuotang and others also arrived in Shanghai on the same train with Jiang yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Actions</h3>
<p>According to people at the Soong residence, Madam Soong had previously gone abroad to recuperate and had recently returned to Shanghai. Her old illness had not fully recovered and she had been vomiting from time to time recently, so Chairman Jiang and his wife came to Shanghai to inquire about her. After arriving at the Soong residence at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Jiang went to Kong's residence at 9:00 AM and then returned to his residence for lunch with Kong Xiangxi and his wife. He Yingqin and Liu Jiwen arrived at the Soong residence one after another to pay their respects but did not meet him. In the afternoon, Chairman Jiang and his wife returned to their residence to rest and declined visitors. Zhang Jinshu, the representative of the Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan, went to pay his respects but was not received. At 7:00 PM in the evening, he went to the Soong residence again to meet with Xiong Shihui and Zhang Qun for a long time. It is heard that he will stay in Shanghai for two or three days and then return to Nanjing and then to Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>Xiong and Zhang's Conversation</h3>
<p>This reporter interviewed Commander Xiong and Mayor Zhang yesterday. According to Zhang, Chairman Jiang's visit to Shanghai this time was purely a private matter and had no political relationship. The date of his return to Nanjing will be decided tomorrow (the 1st). Xiong said that Chairman Jiang's trip to Jiangxi is still a few days away. After Chairman Jiang arrives in Jiangxi, I will go to Shanghai and then rush to assist in directing the suppression of bandits. Most of the Fifth Division is now stationed in Jiangxi. In the future, the Fifth Division will assist other departments in their efforts to suppress the bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in order to thoroughly resolve the matter.</p>
<h3>The British Economic Survey Group Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Purpose of the Delegation's Visit to China</p>
<p>The Welcome of Chinese and Foreign Authorities</p>
<p>The British Far East Economic Survey Group, led by Sir Thomson, arrived in Shanghai on the RMS Nalder at about 10:00 AM yesterday. The Shanghai Municipal Government had put up a banner at the New Customs Wharf that said "Welcome to the British Far East Economic Survey Group." Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang, representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Mo Ruoqiang, Dong Keren, and Tian Heqing, representatives of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and representatives of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce also welcomed them at the wharf. On the British side, British Consul-General Bai Linan and others welcomed them at the wharf. The British business survey group is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel. Various news and views are compiled as follows:</p>
<h3>Records from the London Daily Newspaper</h3>
<p>The London Daily Herald of September 20th of this year carried a telegram from Bombay entitled "Japan's Encroachment on Indian Markets," the content of which is as follows: Although the Indian National Congress is making every effort to advocate domestic goods and resist foreign goods, the amount of goods shipped from Japan to India has actually increased. Unexpectedly, the hats worn by many Gandhi followers in India are now Japanese goods. In the first half of this year (January to June), the amount of cotton and rayon shipped from Japan to India increased by 8,000,000 yards compared to the same period last year, and by 22,000,000 yards compared to the year before (1928).</p>
<h3>Mission of the British Business Delegation</h3>
<p>Sir Ernest Thompson, the leader of the British Far East Economic Survey Group, once said, "The purpose of our group's tour of the Far East is to observe the current state of British trade with China and Japan and to seek ways to improve it. We are very dissatisfied with the current state of trade in the Far East. Now we should know where our mistakes lie, where we are not adapting to market needs, why we have lost our former dominant trading position, and how we can recover the lost business. Now each of our members bears a heavy responsibility. This is what the government has entrusted to us. Now we should study the reasons for the current difficulties, and hope that when we return home, we will not only be able to report in detail the hopes and needs of the Far Eastern market to the British business community, but also find ways to overcome the many difficulties that currently hinder business, so that we will not fail this trip."</p>
<h3>Objectives for Coming to China</h3>
<p>"I am deeply honored to have been asked by the government to lead this delegation. I am delighted to be spending time with all of you. The members of this delegation have all been carefully selected and do not include ordinary tourists, so we are confident that we will be able to accomplish many useful things. We plan to go to Japan first and then to China before the end of November. At that time, we will surely receive a warm welcome from the people there. We hope that this trip will not only increase trade with China, so that both countries can benefit, but also that China will be encouraged to develop."</p>
<h3>Photograph of the British Far East Economic Survey Group Arriving in Shanghai (Taken by this Newspaper)</h3>
<p>Although China has been experiencing frequent internal strife in recent years, its foreign trade value has been increasing year by year. For example, its current import value has doubled compared to 1913, and in 1928 it reached a huge £178,600,000. In the past, Britain held a dominant position in the Chinese market, but now it has lost it, because current British trade with China has decreased by half compared to 1914. At the same time, our strong business rivals are emerging one after another, so the most important thing for the British business community at present is to find out the reasons for the failure, and where we are inferior to other countries in terms of the goods supplied to China. Now we need to adapt to the needs of China and take appropriate steps.</p>
<h3>British Business Rivals</h3>
<p>Since we need to study the needs of China carefully, we also need to examine the sales methods of competing countries in detail, and then know how to improve the current trade and compete with competing countries. We hope to see the development of Chinese industry, so that we can assist those who generally increase productivity. We welcome receiving reports on China's development often, and only by understanding the situation of development can we increase Sino-British trade. The population of China currently accounts for about a quarter of the world's population. As long as its living standards improve slightly, international trade can be rapidly increased. British trade with China, cotton alone, accounts for about 35% of the total, and about 15% of China's total imports. The scope of the delegation's investigation is not limited to the cotton industry, but also includes wool, yarn, steel, and other industries. The amount of these goods shipped to China every year is very large, so we must pay close attention to these industries.</p>
<h3>Members of the British Business Delegation</h3>
<p>Sir Thomas Allen is a representative of the cooperative movement and a member of the Imperial Economic Committee, a member of the Empire Marketing Board, and also a member of the Bank Finance and Industry Committee. Mr. Bell is a member of the trade union and has gained a glorious position in the labor movement. Five years ago, he was elected as the secretary of the United Textile Factory Workers Association and the vice-chairman of the Amalgamated Weavers Association. He will certainly be of great help to this survey work. Mr. William A. Crowther and Lieutenant Colonel Reginald Morcom are both industrial experts. Mr. Crowther is a member of the Huddersfield Woollen and Worsted Federation and the British Wool Research Council, and is a representative of the wool industry. As for Mr. Morcom, he is a well-known leader in British electrical engineering. He has served as the vice-chairman of the British Electrical and Allied Manufacturers Association and has made many contributions to the organization of the association. He is also the vice-chairman of the Federation of British Industries and the Institute of Electrical Engineers. Mr. Louis Beale is a representative of the government, a commercial commissioner and a commercial advisor. He is familiar with foreign affairs and has special expertise in market surveys, so he will definitely make many contributions to this delegation.</p>
<h3>Members of the Cotton Sub-Mission</h3>
<p>In addition, there is also the Cotton Sub-Mission. The names of the members are listed below: Mr. Birchenough has served as an executive committee member of the Amalgamated Association of Operative Spinners for the past twenty years and has been a member of the General Federation of Trade Unions for more than ten years. Mr. Duxbury has extensive experience in various departments of yarn factories. He is a member of the Cotton Reconstruction Board and the Joint Committee of Cotton Trade Organizations. Mr. Edmondson has been the secretary of the Federation of Calico Print Pers and a member of various finished goods industry committees for the past fourteen years. Mr. George Green is familiar with factory affairs and is currently the chairman of the Padibam Manufacturers Association and the manager of George Green and Co (Padibam Ltd). Mr. Reiss is a member of the Manchester Chamber of Commerce and the manager of Reiss Bros Ltd. This company has been in contact with the Chinese market for about 100 years. Mr. Reiss is familiar with the situation in China and has been to China. Mr. Wild has been engaged in the spinning industry for more than 30 years. Since 1923, he has always represented the Federation of Master Cotton Spinners at the biennial meetings held in Washington. Dr. Briggs and Mr. L. St. Quinten Hill C.B.E. are the secretaries of the delegation, and Mr. F. A. Barnes is the assistant secretary of the delegation. Mr. N. A. Guttery is the secretary of the Cotton Sub-Mission.</p>
<h3>Opinions of Members of the Cotton Delegation</h3>
<p>The members of the Cotton Sub-Mission will definitely gain sufficient knowledge and experience in the cotton industry on this trip. Our responsibility is very important. As mentioned earlier, now that our delegation has so many talents, we are not afraid of not achieving excellent results. The development of our foreign trade is closely related to the prosperity of the whole country, and its development cannot depend on the strength of one person. We must have a spirit of cooperation. We should not only pay attention to the needs of special industries, but also pay attention to the needs of the national industry. When we return home next spring, we plan to submit the report we have compiled to the Development of Foreign Trade Conference for detailed discussion, and within the possible scope, we will try to implement our suggestions step by step.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Receptions and Visits</h3>
<p>Itinerary for receiving the delegation members: December 4th and 5th, entertained by the Chinese and British authorities in Nanjing; 8th, banquet (British Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai); 9th, evening banquet (Municipal Government); 10th, afternoon tea party (Industry and Commerce Department's Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau and the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs); 11th, banquet (Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce); 13th, banquet (British Minister's representative, Grenfell); 16th, afternoon welcome party (British Consul General and Commercial Counselor in Shanghai).

<h3>Mo Ruoqiang's Wishes</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau sent an essay written by Mo Ruoqiang entitled "What is Desired of the British Business Delegation," which is quite insightful and revealing, as follows:</p>
<p>Since the European War, the world's economic situation has undergone drastic changes. Whether it is a country with a small population or a country with a superior location and abundant resources, it must open up new markets overseas in order to solve the problems of overproduction and unemployment of workers. Britain has recently seen a decline in foreign trade, leading to overproduction and a sharp increase in unemployment at home. In order to save the domestic economic crisis, it has thought of expanding trade in the Far East and specially dispatched Sir Ernest Thompson to lead the British Far East Economic Survey Group to tour East Asia. The purpose is to survey the current state of trade in the Far East, the future development trend, and the views of our country's upper and lower classes on Britain, and then plan how to promote advantages and eliminate disadvantages in order to improve, how to compete with other countries, and restore the inherent trading position. Its impact on political and commercial circles between China and Britain is very important and significant. We, as local hosts, should sincerely welcome them, and for the future development of Sino-British trade, we feel that there are unfulfilled expectations beyond the receptions and banquets. Now, I would like to briefly express my views on the relationship between Sino-British trade, based on the customs records this year. The trade situation between Britain and British-owned areas, excluding Hong Kong, still maintains its inherent position. For example, in 1929, the import trade accounted for 21.6% of China's total national import, while in 1928 it only accounted for 19.6%. As for the export trade, there is not much difference before and after. The following table shows the trade situation between China and Britain over the years:</p>
<p>Table of Trade Value between China and Britain (1922-1929)</p>
<p>Year From China to Britain From Britain to China Total</p>
<p>(Unit: Customs Taels)</p>
<p>1922 38,507,874 142,925,550 183,800,424</p>
<p>1923 43,207,101 120,390,229 163,604,353</p>
<p>1924 50,250,851 112,611,025 162,861,876</p>
<p>1925 47,642,185 93,137,777 140,780,962</p>
<p>1926 55,835,783 116,269,419 172,105,202</p>
<p>1927 57,991,169 75,023,941 133,015,635</p>
<p>1928 61,063,733 113,756,581 174,820,321</p>
<p>1929 74,334,237 119,148,969 193,485,206</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The above table proves that China's trade with Britain, whether it is export or import, shows an increasing trend. For example, in 1922, the value of goods transported from China to Britain was only 28,507,874 taels of silver, but in 1929 it jumped to 74,334,237 taels. In 1929, the value of goods transported from Britain to China was 119,148,969 taels, which was slightly lower than in 1922, 1923, and 1924, but it exceeded 44,076,575 taels compared to 1927. The progress and regression are really astonishing. At present, the goods transported from Britain to China are mainly steel, textiles, machinery, piece goods, tinplate, etc. Because the cities in China are now determined to innovate and strive for construction, the houses built are mostly made of reinforced steel and concrete, so the sales of building steel and plain iron bars are extremely wide. Most of these goods are ordered from British and Belgian companies. In addition, the import of wire ropes is mostly to meet the needs of mines, and the Sichuan salt mines use a particularly large amount, which is also supplied by British and American manufacturers. If British tinplate can still be imported continuously to supply canneries, this industry is developing more and more in China, so the future sales of tinplate can be guaranteed. In addition, the high-quality rayon operated by British merchants can still maintain its original state. In recent years, the production of rayon has been abundant, and its sales in China will be able to remain smooth from beginning to end. Now, among the goods exported from China to Britain, soybeans, soybean products, and various other agricultural products are the most important. For example, in recent years, the soybean market in Manchuria has been improving day by day and has not been affected by the political situation, and the harvest is quite abundant. China ships to Japan and Europe every quarter, and there is no increase. Although the European market price is not high, China's soybean industry can still compete for profits. In addition, the sales of soybean oil in various parts of Europe have also greatly improved, so these goods can all get good prices and be valued again. Recently, because kerosene is suitable for use, those who used soybean oil as fuel have gradually been eliminated, so the sales of soybean oil have all shifted to foreign countries and exports are booming. This is also a major reason. As for eggs and egg products, they are also a major export from China. For example, every winter, the European climate is extremely cold and egg prices skyrocket, which is a good opportunity for China to engage in this trade. In addition, canned frozen eggs are now selling well in various parts of Europe and exports are booming and are getting good prices. If the methods of raising and manufacturing can be improved in a practical way, then the future development is still not determined. In addition, the output value of pig bristles, oils, coarse cloth, hardware and minerals, salt, monosodium glutamate powder, etc. produced in China has been increasing in recent years, and it may not be difficult to develop more opportunities in the British market in the future. In summary, it is sufficient to prove that China's trade with Britain in recent years is not without a spirit of development, because our country has a large population and strong purchasing power, and our country is in an era of construction and needs raw materials and industrial products more than any other country. For materials, we are eager for the help of friendly countries, so any country in the world that can give Chinese people with a friendly attitude and sincere sympathy, China is willing to recognize it as a mutually beneficial country at any time. It is a pity that the British government has always held narrow-minded views and only sought to develop its one-sided business, and has not considered the feelings of the other party at all, which is a pity. Here is a brief description: (1) The businesses already established by Chinese in Australia are not counted as new partners, and the restrictions on Chinese businesses in the area are becoming weaker and weaker as a result. (2) The London Chinese Restaurant now wants to continue to hire new chefs in the country to come to England, but it is difficult to obtain the permission of the British Home Office, which hinders the industry greatly. (3) South Africa has now stopped issuing business licenses to Chinese and is using other methods to deprive overseas Chinese of the legal benefits they have already obtained. The local legislature is currently amending the case of Asians renting houses. If this case is passed, the business of Chinese people in the area will have to stop within five years. (4) From 168 to 1914, the total amount of head tax paid by overseas Chinese in Canada reached 16,844,966 Canadian dollars. This harsh case only applies to overseas Chinese. Since 194, the Chinese population has been banned, even the wives and children of Chinese businessmen in Canada are banned. The intention is to make Chinese people disappear from Canada. The above is only a rough outline. In short, the harsh treatment suffered by overseas Chinese in England and its dependencies is innumerable. If the British do not change their course, the friendship between the two countries will be broken as a result, and it is even more difficult to discuss the development of business. Therefore, when the British business delegation comes to Shanghai this time, during the reception and banquet, the people of the country should first tell them in pain about the various unequal facts and make a unanimous publicity, so that the delegation can suggest to the British government after returning home that all facts that hinder the commercial development of the two countries, such as revising harsh cases, prohibiting the import of Chinese, imposing heavy head taxes, depriving overseas Chinese of legal rights, restricting their legitimate businesses, and strictly setting the qualifications for students studying in England, must be carefully considered and eliminated in order to gain the goodwill of the Chinese people, so that they can cooperate with each other and benefit from trade. It must be known that the benefit of trade between the two countries lies in mutual benefit, and the basis of mutual benefit must be built on the goodwill of equal treatment. I deeply hope that the delegation will understand this and be able to strongly suggest to its government after returning from the Eastern tour in order to promote its awareness, which is what I am looking forward to.</p>
<h3>Household Registration Survey to Begin Today in Various Districts of the County</h3>
<p>Deadline for Completion is One Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received an order from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs to investigate the household registration and issued a survey form to the county. The county has prepared all the procedures and printed the survey forms and distributed them to various districts for application. Yesterday, the county magistrate instructed the district chiefs to follow the provincial order and implement the survey from December 1st (today). The deadline for completion is one month and they must be reported to the county for compilation and reporting. Important local government affairs must not be delayed, it was said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Seat Relocation Issue</h3>
<p>Opinions of Former District Chief Peng of the Second District of the County</p>
<p>In light of the long-delayed resolution of the Shanghai County seat relocation issue, Peng Liren, the former district chief of the Second District of Shanghai County, has drafted his opinions and submitted them to various agencies and local figures yesterday for their consideration and early implementation. His opinion article states:</p>
<p>Since the separation of the city and county in Shanghai, the prosperous areas of the city have all become municipal property, leaving only the impoverished eight rural townships under county jurisdiction. However, the county government is still located within the city's reduced boundaries. This not only violates the theoretical principle that a county's governing body should be within its own territory, depriving it of the conditions to be a county, but also, in reality, various county undertakings lack a central focus, making it difficult to develop. In recent years, various county endeavors have been in a state of impasse. For example, in education, financial resources are stretched thin, making it difficult to sustain. In public security, huge debts have accumulated, creating a precarious situation. Other construction projects are even more impossible to initiate. The root cause is the limited scope and insufficient income, while administrative expenses are restricted by the current system. Not only can they not be reduced from before, but they tend to increase, leading to an extraordinary shortage of funds for undertakings. Existing endeavors are failing daily, and new construction is out of the question. Therefore, moving the county seat to Beiqiao, which is centrally located within the county, has become a unanimous demand of the entire county's populace. It has been repeatedly discussed and resolved by the county representatives' assembly and the county administrative meetings. The county government and the construction bureau have also made several plans, but have been unable to implement them due to various difficulties. However, I believe that if the entire county can be determined to relocate immediately, not all problems would be insurmountable. The county's scope is extremely small. If the county seat is established in Beiqiao, the distance between each district and the county seat would be no more than ten miles. Once the county roads are completed, it would be a direct journey of only a few minutes. In this way, it would be extremely convenient for the county government to direct and supervise the county's undertakings. Establishing a central focus would not only stabilize society, but also allow all undertakings to progress. It is also said that Shanghai Middle School is considering moving to Beiqiao. If so, Beiqiao would not only become the county's political center, but also an educational center. If our county authorities and local figures can invigorate themselves, work diligently, and strive for good governance, then establishing a model county seat would be immediately achievable. Compared to the current situation of being scattered and perfunctory, wouldn't the gains and losses be vastly different? Some say that Beiqiao is originally a village and town without adequate buildings to accommodate the various agencies. We must wait until funds are raised to construct buildings before the relocation can be implemented. However, we are now in a revolutionary period, and we should embrace the revolutionary spirit. After the Turkish revolution succeeded, they built a new capital in Ankara, and everything started from scratch, without extravagance. When the Jiangsu provincial government moved to Zhenjiang, they all temporarily used renovated old government buildings. There are also quite a few old buildings in Beiqiao. Only a few thousand dollars need to be raised for minor renovations to make them usable. When undertakings develop and funds are abundant in the future, new buildings can be constructed. The above is just a brief expression of my humble opinion on the county seat relocation issue. However, if only the county seat is relocated, and the political center can be determined, but there is no solution to the funding problem, then there will be no way to reorganize and develop undertakings. Looking at the current situation, it seems that education funding is difficult to sustain, public security funding is tens of thousands in debt, district governance funding is nonexistent, and township funding is non-existent. As a result, all construction is impossible to carry out. If such a situation is not addressed, it will inevitably lead to bankruptcy. As for the methods of relief, ordinary financial increases in taxes or the creation of new taxes cannot solve the problem. The county's taxes are the highest in the province, and the people's burden is already heavy, making it difficult to increase them further. Even if they are increased, the county's area is small, and the amount of land is only slightly over 200,000 mu, which would not generate much revenue. As for creating new taxes, all of the county's agriculture, industry, and commerce are in decline, making it difficult to increase new taxes before increasing production. Therefore, I believe that we should consider the county-owned properties in the city. For example, the buildings owned by the Education Bureau are currently rented to citizens. The original two-story buildings can be rebuilt into three-story buildings, which would increase the rent by at least one-third. After the county seat is relocated, the original buildings and land of the various agencies do not need to be sold. They can be rebuilt into municipal buildings to collect rent as regular expenses. As the urban area gradually develops, housing prices will gradually increase, and the rent collected will be considerable. With this income, the county can support all expenses. In the future, water conservancy, roads, industry, and education can be gradually constructed to perfection. (As for public security funding, before there is a fundamental solution, the municipal government should still comply with the city-county agreement to provide assistance.) If the buildings are sold, although there will be a large amount of revenue temporarily, there will be no source of income for all expenses in the future, and it will still be trapped in a dead end. Therefore, rebuilding municipal buildings and collecting rent is a fundamental solution. Some may suspect that the municipal government may obstruct this. This is a case of groundless worry. The county has the right to freely dispose of county-owned properties. If the municipal government wants to realize its plan for Greater Shanghai, it should assist this and not obstruct it. Only when the final construction is completed can the municipal government's plan for Greater Shanghai be realized. Otherwise, the presence of county government agencies within the city will inevitably cause many obstacles to the municipal government's facilities. Moreover, Shanghai County is a place of attention for both Chinese and foreigners. The quality of its construction indirectly represents the county administration of the entire country. If it is dilapidated and unbearable, it will inevitably be ridiculed by foreign countries. The municipal government is also a domestic administrative organ and would never bear to obstruct this. If caution is required, a plan may be drafted and submitted by the county to the National Internal Affairs Conference for a public resolution and then submitted to the National Government for record. In this way, no one can undermine it, and all construction in our county can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Liren previously served in district administration and felt that all undertakings in the county were suffering from a lack of funds, making it impossible to proceed. The county seat was also far away in the city. Bearing in mind the difficulties of taking over administration, he racked his brains to realize the plan to relocate the county seat and find a way to increase financial revenue. However, his knowledge was limited, and he could not draft a perfect plan. Now, while studying, he has drafted this article to express his views. If the authorities and local elders adopt it, express their opinions, complete the plan, and implement it, it would be the fortune of the entire county's people, and I cannot help but offer my heartfelt wishes.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Japanese Attitude Toward Recovering Japanese Concessions in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that Wang Zhengting, the minister of foreign affairs, has been in informal contact with the Japanese acting ambassador, Shigemitsu, for some time regarding China's request to recover the Japanese concessions in Hankou and other places. However, strict secrecy was maintained at the time, so there was no news of it from the outside world. This time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs made a formal proposal to the Japanese side. Ordinary Japanese people may be surprised by this sudden event. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo had long expected it. However, according to those familiar with diplomacy last night (29th), although Japanese newspapers are commenting on this request from China, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet issued instructions to Shigemitsu regarding the future response policy and reply to China's note. According to unofficial news from Tokyo close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese government seems to think that it is still too early to discuss this matter. It will probably have to wait until the Japanese parliament adjourns next spring and the Chinese political situation continues to progress rapidly before the Japanese government will proceed with this negotiation.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Two Holders' Associations</h3>
<p>Proposed Petition to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Since relocating to Xie Long Fang Building on Hankou Road 46, the Joint Association of Temporary Exchange Certificate Holders of the Central Bank and the Joint Association of National Government Treasury Certificate Holders of the Ministry of Finance have been quite busy with registration for days. Various groups have expressed sympathy for the association's progress. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that this matter is of great importance to national policy, commercial livelihoods, and has already sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to plead on its behalf and demand redemption. Other silver and money guilds will also make representations. The association plans to immediately elect three representatives to go to Chiang's residence nearby to petition Chiang Kai-shek, who is said to be coming to Shanghai. The association adheres to the principle of holding fewer meetings and doing more work, and all progress is based on practical work.</p>
<h3>Rural Cooperative Movement in This City</h3>
<p>The agricultural product sales cooperative, previously established by the First Agricultural Association of the city's first district, was approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to operate on a trial basis for three months. The deadline has expired at the end of November this year. The organization of the cooperative is very sound, and the members are also quite cooperative. Therefore, there is great hope for the development of the cooperative's affairs. The cooperative has now publicly petitioned the Municipal Council and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for official establishment and continued operation of the agricultural product sales cooperation business in order to develop it. In addition, the Agricultural Association of the first district believes that although the agricultural product sales cooperative is actively progressing, the development of the business still requires considerable official publicity, and that other cooperative businesses such as credit, production, consumption, utilization, and transportation should also be developed as much as possible in order to implement and promote them. Therefore, the association has ordered the farmers' associations in its subordinate villages to convene members in stages to hold cooperative movement lectures to assist in the publicity and progress of the agricultural product sales cooperative in the district.</p>
<h3>14th Standing Committee Meeting of the Rice Union</h3>
<p>Petition to Promulgate the Rice Circulation Act</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Rice Industry Associations of Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, and surrounding counties held its 14th Standing Committee Meeting of Directors and Supervisors yesterday at Cuixiu Hall. The committee members present were Zhao Zixin, Zhu Zixiang, Lu Gongquan, and thirteen others. Zhu Zixiang was elected as the chairman. After performing the formalities, the chairman reported on the progress made during the month. Then, they discussed the letter from the Wujiang County Rice Industry Association regarding the detention of the Yuan Fengtai rice boat by the Pingwang Rice Inspection Office. Although the provincial government has approved the county to investigate and reply, they are deeply afraid that it will not be handled fairly. It was decided to re-telegraph the provincial government, pleading for it to order the Wujiang County government to resolve the matter as soon as possible to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. In addition, Lu Ruiwen and other rice merchants from Changshu sent a letter requesting the removal of Lu Gongquan, the representative of the county. It was decided that the letter was not officially stamped and did not include the addresses of the individuals. It was considered a type of anonymous letter and should not be accepted. Subsequently, Zhao Zixin temporarily proposed that the rice circulation issue in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has not been promulgated to the counties in Jiangsu Province, resulting in difficulties and fines. It was decided to forward it to the Executive Yuan to request the provincial government to immediately promulgate it to facilitate circulation.</p>

<h3>Recent News on Labor-Management Disputes in the Pawn Industry</h3>
<p>The Union Appeals to Various Unions for Assistance. The pawn industry's workers request to amend the treatment conditions. The labor and management sides have held meetings respectively to discuss it several times, but as of yesterday, the management side still used the principle of automatic pay raises without amending the conditions as a pretext. The labor side insisted that amending the conditions was the goal that must be achieved. The two sides are persisting. The union side has sent out many letters to various unions and groups for assistance, saying: "Dear Sirs, Since our association has requested the management side to amend the treatment conditions, it has been several months, and the management side has completely ignored it. Our workers are suffering from difficulties and are suffering both physically and mentally. During this period, the existence of the union is further hampered. The Labor-Management Dispute Handling Law does not apply to disputes between employers and workers, so there is no way to appeal. Fortunately, the various trade unions in the city have helped to jointly request the Social Affairs Bureau to mediate. On November 20, the Social Affairs Bureau convened a meeting between the labor and management sides to advise both sides to resolve the issue peacefully and automatically. However, at this time, it is still difficult to predict whether the management side can resolve the issue and eliminate the dispute early. In the event of deliberate procrastination, our association has no choice but to rather be a shattered jade than an unbroken tile, and vows to deal with the management side. However, we are limited in our ability and are afraid that we will fail miserably. Therefore, we are seeking assistance from sympathetic groups in advance. When our association's labor unrest occurs, please provide assistance in the form of text and strength. We will be grateful."</p>

<h3>One Woman Has Four Husbands</h3>
<p>Relating Her Scandalous History in Detail</p>
<p>Truly the Utmost in Shamelessness</p>
<p>Xu Xiuying, a woman from Yangzhou in her early twenties, is a lady worker at the Gongda Yarn Factory in Yangshupu. Many of the male workers in the factory coveted the beauty of the woman, and many courted her. The woman embraced a spirit of indiscriminate love, and did not refuse anyone who came. She had already had an affair with Xu Jinsheng, her roommate at 270 Yangshupu Road. Now, she had an affair with the male worker Guo Shaoqing. Later, Guo wanted to monopolize her, so he lured Xiuying to live in the home of Zheng Fangshi in Pudong. Before long, she fell in love with Xu Yongfu, a famous figure in the area. Guo saw that the woman could be the wife of anyone, so he sold her to Liu Jinshan, a Pudong villager, as a concubine. Xu Jinsheng originally regarded Xiuying as his wife. Since her disappearance, he had reported it to the police, who had arrested Guo Shaoqing and others for interrogation and detention. The other day, Zheng Fangshi and the persons involved, Fang Degui and Hou Buhao, were also arrested and taken to the Special Court. Xu Xiuying also appeared in court and described her scandalous history in detail, showing no shame at all. One woman has four men, truly the utmost in licentiousness. Judge Ge instructed the three defendants to be detained and interrogated together with Guo Shaoqing and others.</p>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Issues Order to Correct Police Appearance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order yesterday, saying, "It is noted that the most important thing about police uniforms is neatness. The director of this bureau has repeatedly warned about this at business meetings and has ordered the captains of the districts and teams to check and correct it at any time. However, it has recently been found that some police officers still do not fasten their collar badges, wear their belts, tie their leggings, and wear shoes and socks of mixed colors when walking on the streets. This kind of state is all a loss of face. The director of this bureau has been determined to revitalize for a year, and only this one aspect of the work has not been effectively implemented by the responsible officials, which is not what was originally expected. It is necessary to reiterate the prohibition in order to rectify the situation. In the future, police uniforms should be earnestly corrected by patrol officers and sergeants, and they should also report each other regardless of jurisdiction. The bureau will also send personnel to inspect at any time. If the above-mentioned situation occurs again, the offending police officers will be sent to the bureau for severe punishment, and their officers will be given appropriate punishment as a warning. In addition to the distribution, the following order is hereby issued for the captains of the districts and teams to comply with it in its entirety.</p>
<h3>Learning Opera Matters The Paper Turns Into a Contract of Indenture</h3>
<p>Xu Qian, a 37-year-old woman from Changshu who lives in the Yongkang South Goods Store in Beile Road, submitted a petition to the Women's Association yesterday, saying, "I am submitting this petition to request legal assistance in the matter of my daughter being deceived in order to restore the women's movement. My biological daughter, Gui Bao, is 14 years old this year. In February of this year, she was introduced by a Mr. Luo to learn opera at Xu Yuezhen's place at 171 Duoduo Lane, Daji Road. At that time, Xu Yuezhen hired someone to draw up a paper stating that she would thank the teacher 300 yuan after learning, and instructed the petitioner to sign it. The petitioner believed it to be true. Unexpectedly, Gui was taken away by her to study and was forced to engage in prostitution. Now, she claims to the petitioner that if she wants to take the girl back, she must pay back the previous selling price of 300 yuan, otherwise she must be sold elsewhere, saying that the paper established earlier is a contract of indenture, etc. When the petitioner heard the news, she was alarmed and panicked. She was merely a woman who was illiterate and mistakenly fell into a trap. Is there justice in this world? There is no way to appeal. I have always admired your association's efforts to rescue women without reservation. Therefore, I submit this petition requesting your association to assist in handing over Gui Bao, the daughter of the petitioner, by the Xu Yuezhen, to restore her freedom, and to punish her severely in order to bring peace to the timid and restore the women's movement.</p>
<p>De, etc. I present this petition respectfully."</p>
<p>The Victim Trails Robbers</p>
<h3>Upon Learning of Their Whereabouts, They Immediately Report to the Police and Capture Them</h3>
<p>At about 7 PM on the evening of the 26th of last month, the home of Wu Guisheng, a resident of 166 Qinglian Street, Jiumu Village, in the jurisdiction of the Second District, First Precinct of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, was robbed. At that time, there were a total of three robbers, each armed with a pistol. They searched and robbed for about a quarter of an hour before fleeing with the stolen goods. At that time, the victim did not dare to speak out and secretly followed the robbers. They witnessed the robbers fleeing from Xinqiao Street into the French Concession, along Xiqinqiao Xin Street, northward across Fada Road to the entrance of Dongqinqiao, and entering Baoyu Lane. They saw them enter through the back door of No. 34. The victim immediately went back to report the details to the head of the First Precinct of the Second District, Chief Qian. After receiving the report, Chief Qian immediately telegraphed the Second District Headquarters. Subsequently, on the same day, detectives Cao Junda, Tang Genquan, and others, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the French Concession, went to the Ningbo Hotel on Xinqiao Street and arrested the bandit Wang Azhang. They took him to the police station. After the head of the detective briefly questioned him, he handed him over to the detectives who came to take him to court. The Second District Headquarters will transfer him to the Public Security Bureau today for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Bandits Captured Outside Songkou</h3>
<p>Chen Qingxun, the leader of the Second Squadron of the Luzhuang Police Team stationed outside Wusongkou, received a tip that several bandit leaders had sneaked back from Jiangnan and were hiding in the home of a certain family in Xiyan Village, Tong County, and were plotting activities. After receiving the report, the squadron leader secretly led armed police officers to search the address at about 5 AM the other day. They arrested four people on the spot, namely Shen Yulin, member of the bandit army's artillery committee, Zhang Zhusan, member of the organization committee, Shen Jun, transportation committee member, and Mei Baihong, captain of the guard, and confiscated two Mauser pistols, six small cannons, six large swords, and 226 small knives. They immediately took them back to the team headquarters for interrogation. They confessed that they had sneaked into this place from Jiangnan only a few days ago and were currently working in various positions, plotting to take action, etc. After verifying the confession, Director Chen transferred the four bandits and the confiscated military equipment to the Nantong County Police Brigade yesterday afternoon for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case in Changxing Township, Baoshan</h3>
<p>Since this spring, pirates have repeatedly landed and kidnapped residents in Changxing Township, First District, Baoshan County, causing those with some property in the township to move away. Feng Baoxiang, the owner of the Feng Taihe Grocery Store, had his son and daughter-in-law kidnapped by pirates to Da'an Port outside Wusongkou in June of this year. Feng spent 3,000 yuan to send someone to redeem his son and daughter-in-law. Only a few months had passed since then. Unexpectedly, at about 10 PM the other night, two more pirate ships carrying 50 to 60 pirates sailed to the coast of Changxing Township and landed directly at Feng's house to rob. Before leaving, the pirates intended to set fire to the house, but they did not do so because Feng's wife pleaded bitterly. However, five of his children were kidnapped by pirates and taken to the pirate ship, which set sail and left. At that time, Feng was invited by a friend to go elsewhere and was spared. What is most pitiful is that his daughter-in-law, who had just been redeemed from the pirate den a few months ago and was bedridden, was also dragged down from the bed by the pirates and kidnapped. She was then abandoned on the beach by the pirates due to her severe illness and difficulty in walking. Later, her family</p>

<h3>Robbery Disguised as Marriage with Outcries of Kidnapping</h3>
<p>Hou Gu-shi, a resident of Houjia Bridge Township, Zhenru, is over thirty years old. Her husband is deceased, and she has a beautiful daughter named Yun Zhen, who is of marriageable age. She was betrothed in childhood to A-Fu, the son of the Hou Ge family, who lived in the same residence. At that time, both families agreed. However, A-Fu, being just over twenty, was naturally rogue-like. Because his future wife's family was not far from his, he often went to tease Yun Zhen, hoping to take liberties. Yun Zhen, seeing her fiancé as frivolous, developed feelings of disdain and often avoided him, even harboring thoughts of breaking off the engagement. The Ge family, eager to have a grandson, engaged a matchmaker to arrange for a propitious day for the wedding. But Gu-shi, knowing her daughter was unwilling, made excuses that Yun Zhen was too young and needed to wait three more years. The Jin family learned of this and realized the woman's side was deliberately delaying, intending to renege on the marriage. So, the day before yesterday, they gathered more than a dozen relatives and friends, hired a sedan chair, and ordered people to carry it over. Ge-shi and her daughter-in-law, Hou Jin-shi, called the group into the house and dragged Yun Zhen from her bed, forcing her into the sedan chair. Gu-shi, witnessing this, was shocked and cried out, "Kidnapping!" Fortunately, the police officers from the Fourth District, Third Precinct, were patrolling nearby and rushed to apprehend them. Seeing the police arrive, the crowd scattered and fled into the fields. Only Hou Jin-shi and Hou Ge-shi were apprehended. After an interrogation by the police chief, they were ordered to be sent to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>Shen Fuqing Sues Wife for Immoral Conduct</p>
<h3>Files for Divorce</h3>
<p>Shen Fuqing, from Wujiang, resides at No. 8 Gao Lane, outside Dadongmen, and is in the fruit business. He has filed a lawsuit in the local court against his wife, Shen Lin-shi, for immoral conduct, seeking a divorce. The main points of his complaint are as follows: He married the defendant last November. Since she entered the house, she has been incredibly wasteful and often doesn't return home until late at night. This February, she went back to Ningbo on the pretext of visiting relatives, but never arrived. The plaintiff wrote to his in-laws, who said she hadn't returned to Ningbo. She only returned home in April. The plaintiff advised her to change her ways, hoping she would improve. However, in June, she secretly stole clothes and went out to squander money, only returning in July. The plaintiff questioned her, and she produced a pawn ticket. When he tried to reason with her, she gathered seven or eight thugs to drag the plaintiff to a teahouse for a "negotiation" with the intention of extorting money. On September 27, she again stole a bag of clothes and fled without a trace. Later, the plaintiff's mother, Zhang-shi, spotted her and took her to the Chonghai native association. He was then persuaded to take her back. On October 6, the defendant falsely accused him of assault in a lawsuit before the Procuratorate of your court. Now, the defendant has been associating with rogues since she left in September and has not returned home. The plaintiff is from a poor family and it was not easy to marry a wife, and he still has no children. For the sake of his entire life, he cannot allow her to be dissolute outside. The various sufferings the plaintiff has endured are difficult to describe in writing. If he does not separate from her soon, the future consequences will be unimaginable, etc. The defendant, Shen Lin-shi, has engaged lawyer Sun Qiying to file a defense. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Zhenhai opened the court for the trial. The plaintiff recounted the previous events. Then, the defendant, Shen Lin-shi, testified that she is 23 years old, from Chongming, and does not want a divorce. She did not return to Ningbo in February. On March 14, she was taken back by a relative, and on April 8, she returned to her husband's house. In May, her husband, in turn, called the police to arrest her, but she has not engaged in any misconduct. Her husband injured her, and she was treated at the Nanyang Hospital for half a month before recovering. Judge Zhao, having heard the testimonies, stated that since the plaintiff claims there is a case pending in the Procuratorate, he will wait for the file to be retrieved before scheduling another hearing.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Woman's Divorce Case Awaits Judgment</p>
<p>Song Lianxiang, a young woman from Ningbo residing at No. 63, Daxing Li, Xingjia Mu Bridge, Zhabei, recently engaged lawyer Xu Qinpu to sue her husband, Wang A-gen, in the local court for abandonment, seeking a divorce, etc. Her statement is as follows: The plaintiff is 24 years old this year. When she was fifteen, she married the defendant through a matchmaker. When she was twenty, she moved to Shanghai with her husband and rented a house at No. 3, Taoyuan Li, Tilanqiao. Unexpectedly, on June 1, in that year (i.e., 1926), the defendant, Wang A-gen, suddenly left and has not been heard from for several years, leaving the plaintiff's livelihood unattended. Thinking that there is no land or property in her hometown, nor parents-in-law or children, how can she support herself? For several years, she has only been able to survive by borrowing money. She now knows that the defendant has another wife outside, which is a clear case of intentional abandonment. Rather than bear the empty name of "wife," it is better to simply get a divorce, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Qufei opened the court. The defendant did not appear because his address is unknown. The plaintiff, Song Lianxiang, accompanied by her newly engaged lawyer, appeared in court and recounted the previous events. After the plaintiff's lawyer presented the case, the judge announced the end of the debate and that a judgment would be rendered later.</p>

<p>A woman, Zhang Wang-shi, represented by a lawyer, sued in the Criminal Court of the Public Concession, stating that the plaintiff married the defendant, Zhang Shanfa, in 1913. In 1920, because the plaintiff could not bear children, she agreed with the plaintiff to marry a woman surnamed Mou as a concubine. Unexpectedly, before long, the defendant became intimate with a woman surnamed Mou and abandoned the plaintiff as if she were worn-out shoes, neglecting to provide for her. Moreover, the defendant, in the past year, used someone else's name to borrow 100 yuan in silver from the plaintiff, giving her a promissory note. When she asked for it back, not only was she not repaid, but she was beaten. Under such circumstances, it is difficult to grow old together, and she requests permission to divorce and recover 1,000 yuan in alimony, etc. The defendant also engaged a lawyer to defend, stating that the plaintiff and defendant are acquaintances, not a formal married couple. The plaintiff's accusation of abandonment is factually incorrect. The plaintiff, before 1915, was surnamed Li and had a son with a man surnamed Li. The plaintiff's accusations are baseless and should be dismissed. The plaintiff, Zhang Wang-shi, claimed that although the woman and Zhang Shanfa were not formally married, the defendant wrote a marriage contract in his own handwriting and signed it, vowing that if he ever regretted it, he would die in prison in the future. She now presents the marriage contract for review. In the past, the woman worked as an amah in the home of a foreigner, and all the wages she earned were spent by the defendant. Now, the woman is over forty years old and has stopped working as a maid, so the defendant dislikes her because she is old and not as young as other women, and also because she cannot earn money for him to squander, so he abandons her. She requests a strict investigation. At this point, Judge Zhu Cheng announced to the defendant: "Although the plaintiff and you are not formally married, you have lived together for over ten years. We cannot bear to see her abandoned and neglected."</p>

<p>The defendant was ordered to pay 500 yuan to the plaintiff and was released on bail pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Mother and Son Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Cha Jin-yuan, 38 years old, from Changshu, resides in the French Concession, Baxianqiao, and is a fruit vendor. His mother, Yao-shi, works as a servant in the home of a Liu family in Tongyi Li, Nanjing Road, in the Public Concession. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Cha Jin-yuan went to Nanjing Road to visit his mother. At this time, Yao-shi had gone to the vegetable market. Cha searched and found his mother at the small vegetable market. Both mother and son were unable to avoid an oncoming car and were knocked down, injuring their right legs and faces. Afterwards, the car owner sent both of them to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>One Punch Kills</h3>
<p>Zhang Yishuang, 45 years old, from Jiangbei, is a dock worker residing at No. 252 Yuqing Li, East-West Huade Road. The upper floor of his residence is sublet to Xu Saozi, 30 years old. In November of last year, a car driver named Huang Jinmao owed Xu 40 yuan in hui money, constantly making excuses and repeatedly failing to pay. Yesterday evening at 7:30 PM, Xu invited Zhang Yishuang to go with her to Huang's place to demand the money. Huang acted arrogantly and rudely, speaking disrespectfully and arguing heatedly. Seeing this situation, Zhang became enraged and could not help but side with Xu. Huang then turned his anger on Zhang, and they began to fight. Huang's friend (Gu Erdaizi) and Zhang Laoer also joined the fray, helping Huang Jinmao to restrain Zhang and beat him severely, striking Zhang's waist with a punch. Zhang instantly lost his breath and died on the spot. Someone immediately reported the incident to the police station, and they arrested the perpetrator, Zhang Laoer. The others, realizing they had caused a major disaster, fled through the door and escaped. The body was transported by car to Tongren Hospital and then to the Fei Lun Road morgue for an autopsy.</p>
<p>Stomach Pierced by Nail</p>
<h3>Large Intestine Protrudes, Zhao Wenxiang in Grave Danger</h3>
<p>Zhao Wenxiang, a Taoist priest from Shandong residing at No. 129 Shunjin Li, Hongzhen, East Shanghai, was sleeping on the upper floor of his residence last night at 8:30 PM. Needing to urinate, he hastily descended the stairs. In the dim light, he accidentally lost his footing and fell. A large iron nail was located next to the ladder on the lower floor, and Zhao's stomach landed directly on the point of the nail. Blood gushed out instantly, and he lost consciousness. Neighbors, hearing the noise, gathered and managed to remove the nail. Zhao's large intestine also protruded, a gruesome sight. He was then hired a car and sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. After doctors performed surgery, his condition gradually improved, but his fever spiked, and his mind became confused. According to the doctors, Zhao's life is in grave danger.</p>
<p>The Misfortune of Child Brides</p>
<h3>One Forced into Prostitution, One Coerced into Being Sold</h3>
<p>(1) Liu Zhendi, a 19-year-old girl residing on the upper floor of the Tianyicheng Hotel on Qingyun Road, Zhabei, submitted a petition to the Women's Association yesterday, stating: "Petition regarding being abused and coerced into prostitution by my aunt-in-law. I, Zhendi, was arranged to be a child bride at the age of fifteen by my father, Liu Yongqing, through matchmaker Shao Jinbao.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Zou Shao-shi constantly abused and cursed me, forcing me into prostitution. Although I, Zhendi, come from a poor family, I am unwilling to engage in this improper business. Her abuse and cursing became even more severe, and she repeatedly drove me out. Having no choice, on the thirtieth day of the eleventh month of the lunar calendar last year (1929), I returned to my mother's home to make a living by doing hard labor to maintain my purity. Unexpectedly, my husband's family suddenly wants to take me back. If I am to remain a child bride, I will refuse until death. If I am to return to the Zou family as a daughter-in-law, it must be after Shui-gen is older and has a proper job. I, Zhendi, will voluntarily enter the door and will have no objection. Therefore, I earnestly request your association to quickly provide legal protection. I am filled with urgent and imploring sorrow. Respectfully submitted." (2) Also, Mao Linghua, a 23-year-old woman residing at No. 270 Beihai Road, the British Concession, submitted a petition to the Women's Association yesterday, stating: "Petition regarding being threatened, intimidated, and intended to be sold. Please review and provide assistance.</p>
<p>I, Mao Linghua, entered the Dai family as a child bride at the age of thirteen. At the age of fourteen, I was sent out by the Dai family to work as a servant. At the age of seventeen, I married Dai Dejin. Unexpectedly, the following year, I was again driven to Shanghai to work as a servant. Dai Dejin then drifted away and his whereabouts have been unknown for six years, with no news. His malicious abandonment is extremely evident. Unexpectedly, on the twenty-third of this month, he suddenly brought a group of thugs and, using threats and intimidation, took Linghua to No. 1013 Xinshi Road, Jiangwan, and hid her. For days, he has been soliciting customers, choosing a price to sell her. Fortunately, yesterday afternoon, her father found her and waited for the woman to go out before rescuing her. However, according to information obtained, Dai Dejin and a group of thugs are watching day and night, and their intentions are clear. Dejin first abandoned her and drifted away, and now he has joined with thugs to coerce and sell her. The relationship of husband and wife is completely broken. Therefore, I earnestly beg your association to provide assistance and guidance on how to proceed. I am truly imploring. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>Police Should Be Polite When Inspecting Vehicles and Pedestrians</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau issued a circular to its subordinate districts and teams yesterday, stating: "Inspecting vehicles and pedestrians is originally a temporary expedient to eliminate hidden dangers. The valuable thing is that the police should be peaceful in their approach, so that the public understands the purpose of the inspection and avoids misunderstandings. For example, when performing this duty, if encountering someone with status or accompanied by family members, and there are no unusual circumstances, once the matter is clarified, they should be allowed to pass immediately. When foreigners residing in the interior or traveling by car pass by, if it is deemed necessary to conduct an inspection, even more courtesy should be shown to be appropriate. However, recent reports indicate that police officers in various districts and teams often point guns at vehicles, acting aggressively, and even arbitrarily inspecting vehicles with no suspicious signs (forcing them to stop). This kind of meaningless action, intended to protect the people, actually harasses them and is not the original intention of this bureau chief in setting up checkpoints. Repeated admonitions have been ignored, which is extremely abominable. The district and team leaders in charge have failed to supervise effectively and cannot escape responsibility. From now on, the attitude to be maintained during inspections and the procedures to be followed must be clearly explained to the police officers under your command in order to correct this. If such negligence continues, strict disciplinary action will be taken as a warning to those who deliberately disobey orders. In addition to distributing this order, it is hereby ordered that all district and team leaders comply with it and not violate it. Be sure to comply."</p>
<p>Resumption of Rubber Lawsuit</p>
<h3>Decision on Whether to Render an Interim Judgment to Be Made After Reviewing the Case</h3>
<p>Wu Rongchang, a compradore for Xinji Foreign Firm, previously entered into a contract with Zhenhua Garden to sell rubber. When the delivery date arrived, Wu had no goods to deliver. Zhenhua Garden then purchased elsewhere, but the price was much higher than the one set by Wu, resulting in a loss of tens of thousands of gold. They sued in the Special District Local Court. Wu engaged lawyer Shen Yuesheng to argue that the contract was signed on behalf of Xinji and that Xinji should be responsible. He requested that the court first render an interim judgment on this issue. The judge then adjourned the case for a later hearing. This was previously reported in the newspaper. The day before yesterday, Judge Zhou Daren resumed the hearing. Lawyer Shen still maintained the above argument and requested that an interim judgment be issued first. His reasons were threefold: (1) Xinji Limited Company is registered in Hong Kong. Wu Rongchang was entrusted by the company to enter into a contract with the plaintiff, so the subject of this lawsuit should be Xinji. (2) Wu is a compradore for Xinji and is an employee of the company and cannot represent the company in the lawsuit. (3) Even if the plaintiff suffered losses, they can only negotiate with Xinji. Therefore, if the subject of the lawsuit is not resolved first, there can be no talk of losses. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that, according to a precedent set by the Supreme Court, foreign firms not registered in our country are not recognized as legal entities, and the Chinese manager should be held responsible. The compradore is the Chinese manager, and the defendant, Wu Rongchang, has no excuse to shirk responsibility. Moreover, he is still a shareholder of Xinji. When the contract was signed, the plaintiff only recognized Wu and did not recognize Xinji. Now that he is not fulfilling the contract and wants to push it onto others, there is no reason. If the defendant insists on requesting an interim judgment, he should be ordered to submit the Xinji share register, etc. Lawyer Shen replied that Xinji's share capital is 250,000, and Wu only owns a small portion of the shares. However, Wu is only a compradore and not the manager of the branch. The precedent cited by the plaintiff is not applicable. The nature of an interim judgment is to save litigation time. If the subject of the lawsuit is not resolved, the other parts cannot proceed. This is actually beneficial to both parties. Why oppose it so strongly? Judge Zhou then announced that both lawyers should wait for the review of the case. If there is reason for an interim judgment, it will be as the defendant requested. If there is no need for an interim judgment, another hearing will be scheduled. The court then adjourned.</p>
<p>The Grand China Woolen Mill's Winter Clothing Exhibition</p>
<h3>Review of the Event</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony the Day Before Yesterday The Grand China Woolen Mill held its winter clothing exhibition at the National Products United Department Store on Nanjing Road the day before yesterday. Guests attending included Zhao Jinqing, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Visiting Bureau in Shanghai; Wang Yansong of the Municipal Party Committee; Ye Huijun of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce; Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Lin Kanghou of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce; Dong Kerren of the National Products Exhibition Hall; Lu Xingzhuang of the National Products Factory Federation; Ji Jiannan of the Machinery Industry Association; Shu Huizhen of the National Products Maintenance Association; Tu Kaizheng of the New Medicine Association; Chen Wangxian of the Telegraph Bureau; and Zhang Shenzhi, Jiang Zhonghe, Yuan Hesong, and over a thousand others. Lin Kanghou, Ye Huijun, Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong, Zhang Zilian, Lu Xingzhuang, and Gu Jiuru were elected as chairpersons, with Sun Choucheng as the recorder and Wang Hongxiang as the master of ceremonies. After the meeting opened, Zhang Zilian reported on the establishment of the Camel Down Mill by Mr. Gu Jiuru, the recent establishment of the Grand China Woolen Mill, and the purpose of today's opening of the winter clothing exhibition. Next, Pan Gongzhan gave a speech, saying that our country has always had factories for silk and satin that can compete with foreign goods. However, we have not paid attention to woolen cloth. However, winter clothing now uses a lot of woolen cloth, and a lot of money flows out every year. Now, Mr. Gu can pay attention to this, and the future is very promising. Next, Wang Yansong gave a speech, saying that to make the country strong, the people must be rich. To make the people rich, we must develop industry. The Grand China Woolen Mill has invented national woolen cloth. I hope that merchants and users will vigorously promote this national product. Ye Huijun said that foreigners buy raw materials from our country, make them into goods, and then sell them back to China. Every year, I don't know how much money flows out. If this continues, the country will not be a country. I hope that we must use national products in the future to avoid the outflow of rights and interests. Next, Lin Kanghou described that all the shops in Shanghai sell foreign goods. He advised the people to buy Grand China Woolen Mill products first when they want to make winter clothes. Next, Zhao Jinqing gave a detailed speech describing the Japanese people's enthusiasm for using national products. He hoped that all sectors of society would quickly change their psychology of being fond of using foreign goods in the future. Next, Shu Huizhen described the past years of promoting national products. She hoped that women would pay attention. Dong Kerren described the need for woolen cloth and praised the Grand China Woolen Mill for inventing national woolen cloth, which is beneficial to people's livelihood. Finally, Gu Jiuru gave a thank you speech. Then, winter clothing performances and group singing were held, and other entertainment continued until around 5:00 PM. In the evening, there were singing and dancing, comic skits, masquerade lectures, and other events. It was extremely lively.

<p>Expelled Overseas Chinese from British and Dutch Colonies Host the Press Yesterday</p>
<h3>Each Gives a Heartfelt Speech</h3>
<p>Zheng Luosheng, Zeng Ziying, Luo Ciqi, Liao Peizhi, Feng Hanyue, and other representatives of the Support Association for the Promotion of Public Diplomacy by Expelled Overseas Chinese from British and Dutch Colonies in Southeast Asia hosted a banquet yesterday afternoon to entertain the press. Representatives from various newspapers, news agencies, the Overseas Chinese Federation, and Jinan University attended, totaling fifty people. Zheng Luosheng reported the intention of the reception, saying: "I am very grateful that the reporters and representatives have come to attend. Overseas Chinese suffer deeply from the oppression of imperialism. I hope that reporters in various countries will do their best to publicize this, urge the government to conduct serious negotiations, and awaken the attention of the people to relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese and enhance the status of the nation." Next, Zeng Ziying and Luo Ciqi, expelled overseas Chinese from British colonies, described the situation of overseas Chinese being arrested, detained, and expelled by the British colonial government. Then, Liao Peizhi and Feng Hanyue, representatives of expelled overseas Chinese from Dutch colonies, spoke, saying that the Dutch heavily tax Chinese immigrants, with taxes on entry, taxes on each person, and taxes on business. The heavy taxes are becoming increasingly exploitative. Overseas Chinese born in these lands are treated the same as natives by the Dutch government. Consuls only have the duty to investigate commercial matters and have no power to protect overseas Chinese rights. All of this is restricted by the Sino-Dutch Commercial Treaty. If this treaty is not abolished and the powers of consuls are not expanded soon, overseas Chinese in the Netherlands are equivalent to people of a conquered country. Regarding party affairs, religious affairs, and newspapers, they are viewed as the same enemy as British imperialism. We will make a solemn declaration regarding the abolition of the treaty. Next, Xu Jikong and Lin Youren, representatives of the Overseas Chinese Federation, also made impassioned arguments.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Dismissal of Workers by British-American Tobacco Factory</p>
<h3>Declarations of Support from Four Labor Unions</h3>
<p>The Fourth Group of the Huacheng Tobacco Factory Labor Union declared: "Fellow citizens, we must realize that imperialists set up factories in our country, using our poor compatriots as tools to seek profits for them. They obtain high profits with meager compensation. Our compatriots have no choice but to listen to their commands in order to solve their food problems. They live a life of toil and hardship like oxen and horses. It is pitiable and sad. The imperialists rely on their capital and domineering position to exert their oppression and abuse. Whenever disputes arise, they handle them alone, relying on the power of imperialism, rejecting the mediation of our country's government departments, and directly destroying our poor compatriots and indirectly despising our government's laws. What could be more inhumane and contrary to justice? Anyone with blood will be outraged. Recently, the British-American Tobacco Factory again dismissed a large number of workers without cause. Upon hearing the news, we were extremely indignant. Our labor unions are in the same industry, and our fates are intertwined. How can we remain silent? We are willing to act in the spirit of 'a fox mourning the death of a rabbit' and provide spiritual and material assistance to the union. We would rather be shattered jade than complete tile. We have a few words that we must urgently tell the factory's capital side. We believe that if capitalists want to seek welfare, they must do it alone, or do workers assist them? If there is a vast amount of capital but no good workers, what is the use of capital? How can development be achieved? The mutual use of labor and capital is undoubted. Since they use each other, they should support each other, express the friendship of crossing the river in the same boat, and seek the welfare of both labor and capital. All good operators do this. Now, the factory's capital side does not know the principles of business development. They erroneously dismissed a large number of workers without cause. Is this not like getting a son and abandoning a wife, or a great bandit expelling his father? Not only does this harm people, but it also damages itself. If this causes a disturbance, it will be their own fault. We deeply disapprove of this kind of illegal and unreasonable behavior by the factory's capital side. We have read the three reasons that the union requested from the factory, and they are very sufficient. We can say that they are seeking a compromise. We hope that the factory's capital side will show a little conscience and quickly accept them to avoid the expansion of disputes and maintain the relationship between capital and labor. Otherwise, where there is justice, we will fight to the death and will not allow any cunning excuses. This is our declaration." Signed: Shanghai Huacheng Tobacco Factory Labor Union, Yongtai Cigar Factory Labor Union, Hexing Tobacco Factory Labor Union, and Renhe Cigar Factory Labor Union.</p>

<h3>Suppression of Disruptive Elements in the Tobacco Exchange Industry</h3>
<p>The number of tobacco exchange and grocery stores on various roads, streets, and alleys in the Chinese-administered areas of the city has been increasing daily, leading to competition. The exchange rates and prices in the concession areas are extremely chaotic. Some unscrupulous and ignorant individuals have also infiltrated the industry, using the establishment of tobacco exchange and grocery stores as a pretext to damage commercial reputation and credit. Yesterday, the leading businesses on various roads in the South City jointly signed a letter to the Shanghai South Office, requesting the Executive Committee to promptly formulate measures to suppress the industry and submit a document to the Party and government agencies for immediate announcement and strict enforcement. Those tobacco exchange and grocery stores that operate under false names and continue to cause damage and disruption should be severely punished to serve as a warning, maintain social credit, and secure the livelihoods of fellow businesses. In addition to publishing a declaration to inform fellow businesses to temporarily comply with the association's regulations, once the newly drafted measures are submitted to the authorities for approval and record, a notice will be issued, and major newspapers will be requested to publish and promote it.</p>

<h3>Report from the Advisory and Judging Committee on the Memorial Tower for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum</h3>
<p>To the Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum Memorial Tower Design Judging Committee:</p>
<p>We, the advisors, held a meeting at Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum at 2:00 PM on September 20th to judge the submitted designs for the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Tower. There were a total of six designs submitted, each marked with a code number for identification. The judging criteria were based on the terms set by your committee, while also considering aesthetics and economics. After the advisors discussed each design, the unanimous decision was as follows: Second Prize: Number 6; Third Prize: Number 2; Fourth Prize: Number 1; Fifth Prize: Number 4; Sixth Prize: Number 5; Seventh Prize: Number 3.</p>
<p>The advisors believe that all the designs have shortcomings and none are worthy of being selected for the First Prize, so the First Prize will be left vacant. At the same time, the advisors have drafted a building plan opinion letter. The advisors believe that if the meaning of this opinion letter is further embellished, it would be better than any of the submitted designs. Enclosed are the meeting minutes, judging opinion letter, and drafted building plan opinion letter. Please review and acknowledge. Sincerely, Advisors: Ye Gongchuo, Wang Zhen, Liu Shineng, Liang Dingming, Yan Deqing, Schubart.</p>
<p>Judging Opinion Letter: "Number 1" - Design marked with a T-square and two set squares: (1) The overall tower style of this piece is quite good, but the tower body is an irregular octagon, which is not as aesthetically pleasing as an equilateral one. The entrance archway is not very appropriate. Also, the tower body has fifteen layers, with twelve layers of the same height, which is not suitable for distant viewing. It would be more beautiful if the height of each layer gradually decreased upwards. (2) The internal layout of the top and bottom floors is still relatively complete, but the four staircases on each floor seem excessive, especially on the upper floors. (3) The circular shape of the four corners of the platform is quite distinctive, but it does not match the other parts. The tower base also feels narrow and unattractive. "Number 2" - Design marked with the character inside a square: (1) The drawing technique of this piece is very artistic. All the rules for soliciting designs have been followed. (2) The tower body design is quite good, but the height of each layer is the same, and the outer wall edge is a straight line, which is not attractive from a distance. It would be more beautiful if the height of each layer could gradually decrease upwards and the middle of the outer wall edge was slightly convex to form a fish belly shape. (3) The first floor of the tower's interior is too low, and the staircase in the center is usable, but the elevator inside seems inconsistent with the intention of building a memorial tower. The location of the inscriptions is too high and not very appropriate. (4) The platform and surrounding scenery and decoration are quite ingenious. "Number 3" - Design marked with an archway: (1) This design is divided into two types. One has only eleven layers, which does not comply with the solicitation rules, and it also has many shortcomings. The outward protruding part of each layer is imperfect and uneconomical. (2) The arrangement of the staircase inside the tower is close to the outer wall, obscuring the view. The top and bottom floors do not have a special design, and the design of the interior of each layer is also largely overlooked. (3) The layout of the overall site is also sloppy. "Number 4" - Design marked with the character inside a circle: (1) The height of each layer of the tower body in this piece gradually decreases upwards, which is quite appropriate. (2) The arrangement of the staircases on each floor is well-conceived, but the internal layout of each floor has not been planned in detail, which is a shortcoming. (How should the location for the 180,000 characters be reserved? At least it should be noted.) (3) The platform structure is detracting, and the layout of the main road is deliberately uneven, creating a zigzag shape, which is not grand. It would be more beautiful if the middle part of the tower was slightly convex to form a fish belly shape. The overall construction does not adopt a variety of styles, so it is inevitably repetitive and monotonous. "Number 5" - Design marked with a dragon: (1) The style of this tower is generally acceptable, but the number of layers is two more than stipulated in the solicitation rules. The layout of the lower three layers of the tower is poor. (2) The staircase arrangement is unsuitable. (3) The garden walls and gatehouses around the base of the tower obstruct the view. "Number 6" - Design marked with a double octagon: (1) The layout and drawing technique of this piece are excellent. All the rules for soliciting designs have been met. (2) The exterior appearance of the tower body is very good, and the styles of the bottom and top floors are particularly distinctive. It would be more beautiful if each layer in the middle was slightly convex to form a fish belly shape. (3) The internal layout is not entirely appropriate. The window sills on the upper floors seem too high, making it inconvenient to lean on. If the staircase on the bottom floor is moved to the side, a spacious and beautiful hall could be obtained. (3) The staircases on the upper floors are all located in the center of the tower, which is very appropriate, but the construction and aesthetics of the staircase seem to need further modification. (4) The layout of the entire site, as well as the tower base and steps, are excellent. The planting of trees along both sides of the road is also appropriate, but there seem to be too few decorations in the middle of the road. Based on the above reasons, the order of awards is specifically determined as follows: Second Prize: Design marked with a double octagon; Fifth Prize: Design marked with the character inside a circle; Third Prize: Design marked with the character inside a square; Sixth Prize: Design marked with a dragon; Fourth Prize: Design marked with a T-square and two set squares; Seventh Prize: Design marked with an archway. The construction of this tower is as important as the Dr. Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. It will not only be appreciated by Chinese people, but also criticized by tourists from various countries. It must not only adopt the functions of new architectural styles, but also express the characteristics of the inherent civilization. Although the designs that have been selected this time are not without merit, it cannot be said that they completely meet the requirements. Therefore, the order of awards has been discussed and determined as above. It seems that it is still necessary to adopt the strengths of all designs and design separately when actually constructing it in order to serve as a model.</p>
<p>Building Plan Opinion Letter: (1) Form: The entire building must be majestic, simple, and unadorned, and it must match the style of the mausoleum base. The tower style should be octagonal with a slightly convex middle, like a fish belly. (2) Height: The total height of the tower, including the base and stone platform, must not be less than 70 meters or more than 100 meters. (3) Number and Size of Tower Layers: The tower has a total of fifteen layers including the base. The height and width of each layer decrease from bottom to top, with a slope of 1:16. (4) Bottom Floor of the Tower: The lowest two layers should be combined into one to build a spacious hall. Therefore, the height and width should be specially enlarged. This hall can be used for memorial gatherings. There should be memorials or decorations in the hall to represent the Three Principles of the People, the Five-Power Constitution, the Five Races, and the provinces and special regions. (5) Interior of the Tower: Only stairs can be used inside the tower. The stairs on the bottom two floors should be hidden in the promenade, while the other floors should be installed in the center of each floor. All stone carvings should be evenly distributed on the inner walls of the tower. All doors and windows must not use wood. The top of the tower should be round and built with blue pottery, and it must be equipped with lightning rods. (6) Materials: Wood is absolutely not allowed. All stone materials, unless there are special circumstances, must use natural colors and do not need to be finely polished. Blue glazed tiles should be used. (7) Door Orientation: There should be doors facing both north and south. (8) Lighting: Electric lights should be installed around the tower at appropriate distances and heights for nighttime use to reflect and illuminate the tower body. At the same time, there should be suitable electric lights inside the tower. (9) Steps: The steps must be divided into three lines, going straight up from the front and gradually narrowing towards the tower to avoid the disadvantage of too much difference in size at both ends when viewed from a distance. Trees should be planted between each line to enhance the beauty. (10) Platform: There should be three layers of platform, each shorter and smaller, with railings, gutters, and various decorations around it. (11) Decoration: There should be archways and trees between the ring mausoleum road and the tower to connect them. (12) Paths: The nearby paths should allow vehicles to drive directly to the nearest point of the tower, and a parking lot should be set up nearby. (13) Manager's Residence: This residence should be near the tower and its location must not damage the overall scenery.</p>

<h3>Laughing It Off</h3>
<p>— Seaside Wanderer</p>
<p>Mother: — This Western doctor is really skilled!</p>
<p>Son: — You say he's skilled, but I hate him day and night!</p>
<p>Mother: — Why?</p>
<p>Son: — My illness could have kept me away from school for two weeks, but he healed me in just two days!</p>
<p>Gentleman (Liu, next door, visiting the hostess): — Madam, your and your daughter's piano and violin playing are exceptionally beautiful! Would it be possible to play for us this afternoon?</p>
<p>Neighbor Woman: — Thank you for your kind words, sir. We are ashamed to admit it, but when should we come to your residence? Is there a banquet at your place?</p>
<p>Gentleman: — No, it's just that the rent collector is coming today to demand the rent for last month. I want him to reduce it, so I'm using your music as a reason to reduce the rent.</p>
<p>Wife: — Our child is so brave! He cut his finger today and bled a lot, but he endured the pain and hid his finger so that no one else could see it. He's so brave at such a young age; he'll definitely be outstanding when he grows up.</p>
<p>Husband: — Do you really think he's brave? It's just because that new foreign knife he bought last week with his saved allowance money is now cut and his finger is afraid we will take it back from him.</p>
<h3>Evening Meal at the Firemen's Association</h3>
<p>— Listening Ice Life</p>
<p>Shen Ziyongqing has a fondness for flowers, especially good at chrysanthemums. Every year there are new varieties, and there are no ordinary flowers in pots. He and Mr. Zhu Pingu Shaoyi are equally fond of them. Their hands are chapped, and their fingers are covered in manure, but they don't mind. At the beginning of winter this year, they gathered all the works of art from the three families and displayed them on the third floor of the Firemen's Association in Dongjiadu. They sent invitations to appreciate them, and so, the day before, I drove there. First, my friend Zhang Ruogu precisely photographed them for Zhang's newspapers, so the skirts and clogs were crowded at the doorstep. As soon as I went up the building, I felt that thousands of reds and purples were rushing into my eyes, as if I had entered the Dongyang Chrysanthemum Garden and could not distinguish the Five Beauty Chrysanthemums. More than two hundred pots were scattered around the banquet, encircling the building and forming a world. Shen Zi patted me on the shoulder and laughed, and I also laughed, guiding me to watch carefully and not even making a word of cold greeting. And I strongly insisted that he not follow me too much and be restrictive. At that time, Qin Yanbo, Li (Qicheng) Fuzi, Zhu (Jinyu) and other gentlemen were all watching quietly with their hands behind their backs, and they only nodded in response, covering their spirits and meeting flowers. So I saw the crazy slaves and bears, and if people scolded the little boy for being rude, they would not dare to resign. Chrysanthemums are originally objects between the bamboo fences, lonely and self-appreciating, Tao Lingqu named people in poems and then entered the Hall of Elegance, and then people gathered to comment and often put A and B in high and low positions, and those who are fat are crowned and those who are thin are in the temple. This is how those who love chrysanthemums should be. If you are not small, you know that, I said that chrysanthemums are originally shabby, with thinness as beauty, there are (Shang Ding Zhou Yi) on the shelf, one book with long, thin and fine petals, its shape is like an earring, its color is gold and gray, and there are also withered and scorched ones that want to become stiff. After reading it for a long time, its essence has the spirit of plum and snow. It is a pity that many people despise its appearance and ignore it, which is very sad. As for the lonely and high purity, (Crystal Pavilion) should be pushed, its shape is like an orchid and its purity is like snow. There is no point for deer to dare to invade, and it is indeed a different product. The rest, such as (Hydrangea Yellow), wins with fatness and fullness, "Crane Wings" wins with loneliness and quietness, and "Wang Huanfei" wins with beauty and loveliness. Qicheng Fuzi commented on "Emerald Beard", which is a round flower standing alone with its petals all green and rising like it. Is it Wei? Isn't it Wei Zhonghui who said that Wei is the one who is extremely heavenly? There are also two pots of literati chrysanthemums produced in Japan, with their stems hanging down like bird vines and dozens of flowers tied to the stems and all the flowers blooming upwards, but they are small like green coins with color but no fragrance, which is suitable for potted plants. If the whole hall is full of them, it will be unattractive. If there is no shallow barren strange stone device, it will inevitably lose its appearance. I once saw it several times in the 63rd Garden. It was not a noble species at first. There is also a plant with dark red petals and the back of the petals is white, like thick frost, slightly rolled upwards, and named "Purple Velvet", how appropriate is that! There is also a strange flower in a pot with dense flowers and rich colors, as red and gorgeous as a cockscomb, with three flowers as light pink, which is very similar to the carnation among Western flowers. Shao Yi pointed to Yu and said, "This is Guan Gong chopping Diao Chan under the moon." I smiled at him. There are also several famous species that are exported by the Sanyou Industrial Society and Xiaoguanyuan, elegant, reclusive, clear, beautiful, fat, and thin, which is not consistent. Unfortunately, Yu is forgetful and not easy to describe. He is so fond of flowers! Yongqing is compiling a chrysanthemum manual, which may be able to slightly reduce Yu's guilt. Most of the plants planted in Xiaoguanyuan are American species, with oily and shiny flowers and leaves, shimmering in the bright lamps, like water mercury, which is fascinating, and it is also the result of careful pruning and nurturing. Afterwards, more and more guests arrived, so the banquet was opened and they drank freely. Yu and General Li (Yingshi) gambled and were afraid that they could not beat Ji Qun. Ji Qun arrived later and only accompanied him to drink a few large goblets. Ten thousand flowers were competing in dancing, and the wine was better than the flowers. The fragrance of flowers and wine was so indistinguishable that I could not distinguish them clearly.</p>

<h3>On Tiger Crabs</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Maritime people are curious by nature, and even the slightest differences in things can be exaggerated and displayed in the market to attract wealth. This is the case with the so-called "Beauty Crab" and "Zhang Fei Crab." A few days ago, I attended a banquet at the home of my Fujian friend, Mr. Lin Zihua. Mr. Lin is a collector of antiquities with a rich collection. After the banquet, I happened to browse through his jade, stone, bronze vessels, and tripods. I saw a box, the color of which was a deep, moist lacquer, made from two crab shells joined together. Each shell had human-like faces with whiskers and eyebrows. When asked, he said, "This is a tiger crab. Zhou Li Yuan's 'Min Xiao Ji' (Notes from Fujian) once recorded it." He then turned to the notes, which read: "The tiger crab in Fujian is a different kind of crab, of rough quality and poor taste, not worth mentioning. However, its shell greatly resembles the tiger head painted on people's doors, with a deep red and mottled color. Northerners find it strange, and some set it in to make wine vessels. Tongzhou and Rugao also have this species, commonly called 'Guan Gong Crab.'" Tiger crabs are produced on the seashore in groups of dozens. When enemies come, they can spew red juice to confuse their eyes, like cuttlefish squirting ink to hide themselves. Therefore, they are not easy to catch, but they are very afraid of light. People carry saltpeter and sulfur to the seashore and burn it. The tiger crabs, seeing the strong light, are all surprised and lie prone, not daring to move. People can then pick them up. The tiger crab box in my house is an heirloom from my great-great-grandfather, used to store medicinal powder. Although it is old, it does not leak air, because the inside and outside are coated with glue and sealed very tightly. Seeing this, one wonders if the "Beauty Crab" and "Zhang Fei Crab" that stirred up a sensation for a time are also of the tiger crab variety.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Strange Beast on Mount Tianmu</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chang</p>
<p>Recently, a guest from Mount Tianmu told me about a strange beast that eats monkeys, which is quite bizarre. Now I will write it down.</p>
<p>Mount Tianmu in western Zhejiang is located between Lin'an, Yuqian, Anji, and Ningguo in Anhui. It is a place of layered peaks and dense forests, rich in birds and beasts, especially monkeys. Strange beasts are often discovered. In West Tianmu Mountain, there is a strange beast whose shape and size are similar to a fox, but its fur, head, and tail are black, and its waist is yellow. Therefore, it is called the "Yellow-Waist Weasel." The Yellow-Waist Weasel can sit and stand, and its limbs are like hands, each with five fingers. However, the fingers on its front feet are longer and can grasp objects. It is good at climbing trees, jumping from one tree to another more nimbly than a squirrel. Squirrels must grab the branches of the tree to cross, but it can cross by just grabbing the leaves of the tree.</p>
<p>The Yellow-Waist Weasel is fierce by nature, and all wild beasts fear it. It likes to eat monkeys most of all, and its method of eating them is very strange. When it sees a group of monkeys from afar, it makes a sound to stop them. The monkeys, upon hearing its voice, tremble and stand still, not daring to move. Then, it walks closer and hugs each monkey in the group with its two front feet. While it hugs them, the monkeys all bow their heads and submit, not daring to resist. It picks up the heaviest one, puts a leaf on the monkey’s head, then shouts again to disperse the monkeys without leaves on their heads. The monkeys, hearing the sound, nervously walk away slowly, leaving only the monkey with the leaf on its head to stand there and satisfy its hunger. However, the old monkeys, although heavy, can escape. The old monkeys often encounter the Yellow-Waist Weasel, and they are able to estimate their body weight and their courage grows. They also know that the Yellow-Waist Weasel chooses the fattest to eat, so when they are hugged, they use the method of avoiding the heavy and choosing the light, using their front body lightly upwards to reduce their weight, so even those who are heavy can escape. As for the small monkeys, they have little experience with the Yellow-Waist Weasel eating them, and they are timid, so when they encounter it, they are extremely frightened and faint. When they are hugged, they desperately use their front feet to pull on the grass on the ground, so their bodies become heavier, and it is always these small monkeys that the Yellow-Waist Weasel eats as snacks.</p>
<p>The Yellow-Waist Weasel can not only eat monkeys, but also tigers and leopards, which are fierce and strong. When it sees a tiger or leopard, it jumps onto their buttocks and licks their anus, controlling their abdomen to eat. Once it jumps onto the buttocks of a tiger or leopard, no matter how the leopard gallops and jumps, it can never shake it off, so no tiger or leopard can avoid fleeing for their lives when they see it.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (87)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>Mr. Yang held out a cigarette to a monkey, using his palm to test it. When Yang threw it, the monkey tore the cigarette apart, sniffed it, and found it strange. He extinguished the fire with his palm. I remember Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species" says that monkeys can drink alcohol and get drunk, so they can probably smoke too. However, before, when I was in Guangxi, I took a small monkey in a car, and it also got carsick. This is the same as people. There are many kinds of birds, including large parrots with blue-red and long tails, as big as domestic chickens, which are very rare. I sat in a pavilion with Yang to avoid the rain and ate peas. Suddenly, I heard a very gentle sound falling from above. It was a pink parrot asking for food. Its voice was very charming. Giving it peas, it took them from my hand with its tongue. Its tongue was square, and its claws and beak were sharp. I just don't know if it also eats meat. The pink parrot repeatedly asked for food and didn't leave. Emperor Taizong of Tang said that hungry birds rely on people, and people naturally pity them. I gave it dozens of peas, and each time it asked for food, its voice was nice, as if saying "Give me." In Western languages, a beauty is called a bird, and a savage person is called a beast. This proves that bird nature is better than beast nature, and female nature is better than male nature.</p>
<p>There are also zebras, which are extremely beautiful, with white bodies and black stripes. They are native to Africa and are similar in size to horses, but with stripes. It would be good to mate them with ordinary horses to propagate their species. Even if the stripes aren't pure, they would still be beautiful. There is also an ostrich. This creature is between birds and beasts, shaped like a bird but can be ridden, and it doesn't fly or sing. There is also a one-horned rhinoceros floating its nose in the water. Besides this, there are two elephants each, large and small. Each elephant has its feet tied with two iron chains. I haven't seen any other strange things.</p>
<p>Outside the park, there is a large lake and large trees, where Westerners race boats, which is a very beautiful scene. Mr. Yang paid for all the expenses, etc. Mr. Yang has very high aspirations. On this day, we talked at length about bird nature. I felt a great deal of... The two of us talked about bird nature in the Parrot Pavilion, and I asked what the ultimate question of human nature, good or evil, is like. He said it is most difficult to say. Eastern and Western scholars explain the origins of society, some advocating optimism, thus advocating inherent goodness; others advocating pessimism, thus advocating inherent evil; others taking a middle view, thus advocating a mixed nature; others taking a natural view, thus advocating a natural nature; and others taking a nihilistic view, thus advocating no inherent nature. Optimists include Mencius, Song Dynasty Confucian scholars, Wang Yangming, Jesus, Tolstoy, and Thales' followers. Pessimists include Xunzi, Shang Yang, and Machiavelli. Those who take a middle view include Confucius, who said that people's natures are close, but their habits are far apart, and Yang Xiong, who said that there are three grades of nature. Those who advocate emptiness are Buddhists and Daoists. I advocate that human nature can be good, and it can be achieved by using Kropotkin's science of mutual aid among species to achieve humanity in harmony.</p>
<h3>Eastern Travel Correspondence (23)</h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaohou</p>
<p>Visit to Newspaper Offices of Japan: Among the newspaper offices in Tokyo, Japan, the Asahi Shimbun, the Nichinichi Shimbun, and the China Times are the most famous. Here, I will separately describe what I learned from personally visiting these three major newspaper offices.</p>
<p>(Zi) Asahi Shimbun Newspaper Office: The Asahi Shimbun is the newspaper with the longest history and the most prominent reputation in Japan. When the reporter visited the Asahi Shimbun, a group of students from the Imperial University also happened to be visiting the company. They were received by Mr. Moriyama Hashimoto, the head of the China Department of the company. First, they went to the rooftop of the company's nine-story building (the building has a total of eight floors, plus the basement, making it nine stories). They rested on the flying platform, which overlooked the entire city of Tokyo. I then asked Ms. Du Huairong, who had come with me to visit the company, to take a photo of the elevated train (commonly known as the "sky train") and the sunset over the river bridge. After the Imperial University students finished their tour, Mr. Matsushima Taro, the head of the public relations department of the company, led us to visit the various floors and rooms, explaining everything in detail. I noted that the most notable features were its communication methods. In addition to wireless telegraphs and telephoto, the newest method was to have its own aircraft to ensure speed, and the oldest method was still the old Chinese method of using pigeons to deliver messages. They raised over 500 specially trained communication pigeons. Each pigeon can carry about four ounces of communication paper, delivering it steadily and quickly without error. New machines and old methods were adopted in a broad and inclusive manner. Its Osaka headquarters (the headquarters of both the Asahi Shimbun and the Nichinichi Shimbun are in Osaka, and Tokyo is a branch office, but due to its capital city status, the scale of the branch office is even larger than that of the headquarters) is about 800 li from Tokyo. Telephoto takes only 20 minutes. The editorial department has 350 employees. The attached library has a collection of 30,000 books. The auditorium can accommodate 1,500 people. There are three elevators. Its newest printing press can produce 20,000 copies of a daily newspaper in 15 minutes. It uses about 7 piculs of ink every day and 140 rolls of newsprint every day, with each roll printing 20,000 copies. The business department has 300 employees. There are 45 specially contracted correspondents abroad. In total, the company has about 1,400 employees, including workers. This newspaper was founded in Meiji 21 (1888). According to Mr. Matsuyama, it was initially printed by hand using woodblocks. After several changes, it has reached its current state. After the tour, we were invited by President Murayama Nohei to take a group photo and were presented with several films of various departments and pigeon post, as a memento.</p>
<p>(Chou) Nichinichi Shimbun Newspaper Office: After its establishment, the Nichinichi Shimbun advanced rapidly after the Asahi Shimbun, and its reputation and achievements are also on par with the Asahi. When the reporter visited the company, President Motoyama Hikoichi had gone to the Osaka headquarters, and the tour was led by Mr. Okamura Sadaji, a permanent reporter in the public relations department of the company. The company has six floors. First, we took the elevator to the roof, and then we went down the stairs to visit each floor. First, we went to the electrical type-setting department and the telephoto department. The communication pigeons and other facilities are also similar to those of the Asahi Shimbun. This newspaper was founded in Meiji 5 (1872). It was initially printed using woodblocks. The editorial department has about 300 employees. There are about 500 printing workers. The electrical type-setting department can produce 120 characters per machine per minute, and about 500,000 characters are produced every day. The typesetting room can accommodate 200 workers working simultaneously. The newest printing press can print 80,000 copies per hour by six machines, and 120,000 copies by six machines. This press capable of printing 120,000 copies per hour is the newest model, specially manufactured by the United States for Japan. Not only is it unavailable in other countries in East Asia, but even the largest New York newspapers in the United States can only print 100,000 copies per hour. This machine, which is the newest machine in the world that can print the most newspapers, is truly the hallmark of this company. There is also a folding machine that groups 50 copies into a set. After the newspapers are divided and folded into sets, they are distributed to various locations near Yokohama. The company has a regional lighting switchboard. Once the light indicates where it should be sent, it is sent out by truck in one minute. The company's newsprint is made in Japan. The length of a roll of unfolded newspaper is a "ri" and ten "cho", or about seven and a half li. Each roll can print 20,000 copies. The entire company has about 2,600 employees. The newspaper is published twice a day, in the morning and evening editions, each with 950,000 copies. The total capital is 10 million yen, or more than 12 million yuan. In addition to the two editions, it also publishes a daily summary, weekly magazine, quarterly magazine, and annual yearbook. President Motoyama also serves as the leader of various large economic organizations and is very active.</p>
<p>(Yin) China Times Newspaper Office: "China" is a transliteration of the English word "China," which is a term used by the Japanese to view our country. Since the founding of the Republic of China, places such as the Chinese Embassy and consulates have changed "China" to the words "Republic of China." However, the customs of that country have been followed for so long that it has become a fixed term. The contents and index of the newspaper are divided into (1) editorials, (2) commemorative essays, (3) special articles, (4) current affairs overview, and (5) current affairs commentary. Its only goal, as its name suggests, is to be a special newspaper about our country. Although its equipment is far less grand than the Asahi and Nichinichi newspaper offices, it is necessary for those from our country who visit that country to pay special attention.</p>
<p>Overall, the three major Japanese newspapers, whether due to the scale of their grandeur or the speed of their business spirit, all have much to admire. However, looking at their publications, they fully express the color of their imperialism under a monarchical system, and often exaggerate the propaganda of political events occurring in our country. In the typesetting department of the Nichinichi Shimbun, I saw a typesetting frame with large characters, each an inch square, bearing the names of Chiang Kai-shek and Feng Yuxiang. From this, it can be seen that the newspaper industry pays attention to the politics of our country.</p>

<h3>Dramatic Changes in the Gold Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Turbulence Arises, Peak Approaches Six Hundred Taels</p>
<p>Earthquake News Causes a Terrible Fall of Fifteen Taels in Two Days</p>
<p>Red Bars Still Level, Futures Increase by Eleven Taels</p>
<p>An Overview of the Entire Week: The state of futures gold last week showed:</p>
<p>Extreme and confusing changes, a total loss of control. There were five or six taels of fluctuations each day, circling around 590 taels, with no clear grasp, because news was diverging, and the intentions of industry colleagues were fleeting. From the beginning of the week, things were still even, but suddenly, due to a strange rise in bills of exchange, overseas silver markets also saw a decline, so there was a surge of ten taels, and large households competed to buy, almost approaching 600 taels. Then, due to Japan's sudden serious earthquake, people were filled with fear, and in two days, there was a terrible fall of 14 or 15 taels. By Friday, there was a sudden drop to 81 taels and two mace, and a general bullish sentiment began to emerge. The selling pressure was brave, and by Saturday, the silver market and bills of exchange were exceptionally strong, and there was a rush to pile in, especially those who were short, who were all eager to offset their positions due to their predicament. The price then pierced through the 90-tael mark, suddenly discovering a new high price of 598 taels and six mace. However, the result eased slightly, calculated at 95 taels, an increase of 6 taels and 1 mace compared to the previous Saturday. However, there was a total of 17 taels and 4 mace of retracement during this week. It is said that the Dalian gang has been recently loosening their grip, and the Guang gang Hengxingsheng has made great progress in replenishing their positions. However, Yifeng, Yongcheng, Fengyongxin, Xiangluo, and others have powerful large bullish households who have all sold off. Fuchang Yuancheng Yongdeng specialize in bills of exchange hedges, so their inflows and outflows are erratic, and they are greatly making up for short positions through physical hedging. As for the bill of exchange unveiling price, it was initially pressed down by more than 30 taels to about 30 taels, and then calculated to be pressed between 40 taels. During this week, the total silver of large bars was reduced to 1,875 (with a difference of 1,875), and the American silver price was also reduced by half a point (calculated at 375 cycles). The first token was reduced by a total of one and a half grades, and had already broken into one shilling and seven pence. American exchange rates were also reduced by 875, and East exchange rates were raised by 2.75 points, now reaching 1 tael, 3 qian, 1 fen, and 7.5 li. However, there was no major change in spot red bars, and sales were also normal. Only the silver building industry had some transactions, and the price of futures marks increased by more than 11 taels. Observing the future of the gold market, there is still a period of circling. Judging from the exchange rate, it seems to have the ability to rise, and it should be able to reach the 600-tael mark. The following is a record of the general situation during the week.</p>
<h3>The Process of Rises and Falls</h3>
<p>Since Monday (November 24), the large bars did not change, and the American silver was reduced by 125. There was also no change in the exchange market. As for the gold market, it opened slightly weak, calculated at 587 taels and 6 qian, then 7 qian and 3 li. Suddenly, Xinhong and goods buyers were very interested, and it rose to 89 taels and 6 qian. After that, there was a rotation of more than one tael from time to time. As a result, it was 88 taels and 1 qian, a slight decrease of 8 qian compared to the previous Saturday. The market situation was still mediocre. The entire day only counted for 2 qian and 3 qian of ups and downs. The next day, the silver market trended lower, and the shilling was reduced twice, totaling one grade. Chinese merchants frantically piled in, causing the internal market to be very tight. Therefore, the gold market suddenly rushed out of the 90-tael mark. Large households frantically made up for their previous short positions, and by the afternoon, it had reached 98 taels and 2 qian, a flying victory of 9 taels and 6 qian compared to the previous day. The difference on this day was 7 taels and 6 qian. The next Wednesday, there was a sudden reversal because it was expected that the large bars should be reduced, but they unexpectedly stood still, so people became timid. It opened at 95 taels and 8 qian, and immediately dropped about 2 taels. After that, the ups and downs were uncertain. At noon, it reached 7 taels and 4 qian. In the afternoon, because Reuters reported that the Japanese earthquake was very serious, the industry colleagues were not completely clear. Nai Yuancheng Daixinhong Luo sold out, and Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, Hengxing, Hongli, and other large households inclined to sell. The wind and clouds rose sharply, and it fell by more than 3 taels, calculated at only 92 taels and 45 qian. The total difference for the day was 5 taels high, and it fell again by 4 taels and 9 qian compared to the previous day. The next day, all the newspapers had published reports, and people were terrified because of it. Large households emerged, and the storm surged, pouring down more than 9 taels. From the beginning of the morning, it fell by 4 taels and a half to 88 taels and 3 qian, immediately breaking through the 90-tael mark. The large bars did not change, but the shilling was hung for half a grade, and the internal market was also loose. Industry colleagues sold and then piled in. Until the afternoon, it suddenly dropped to 83 taels and 2 qian, and the back market was 3 taels and 9 qian. The total difference for the day was 5 taels and zero. Recalling the next day, the large bars returned to 0.0625, and the shilling did not change. However, the internal market was initially even and then straight. Industry colleagues advanced and then exited. As for the gold market, it was once depressed in the morning to 81 taels and 2 qian, which was really the lingering effect of the previous night. After that, buyers became active again and went up again, calculated at 87 taels and 8 qian. As a result, 7 taels and a half had already returned to 3 taels and 6 qian. However, there were 6 taels and 6 qian of twists and turns. On Saturday, the large bars fell again, and the exchange market was reduced twice, totaling one grade. Chinese merchants rushed to climb and close their positions, and there were closings, so the gold price rose by 4 taels and 2 qian in the morning to 91 taels and 7 qian, and then rushed out of the 90-tael mark again. After that, Hengxing, Shengda, Fuchang, and others offset their positions, and the shillings were reduced again, suddenly jumping to a new record of 98 taels and 6 qian. However, because the Dalian gang and Tong Taichang, Yuanxing Yong, Yuancheng Yong, and others tended to sell off, the exchange market saw a slight softening, and it fell sharply by 3 to 4 taels. The closing price was 95 taels, and it made a small 2 taels again, only about 3 taels. The market was floating and unstable, and it was difficult to take action. However, it was still up 7 taels and a half compared to the day before. According to the exchange's listed price calculation, there were 7 taels and 3 qian of rotation in half a day, and the two days combined had already risen by 11 taels and 1 qian, while the transactions among colleagues were divergent and inconsistent. The following is a description of the high and low prices of British, American, and Indian money markets, as well as futures gold.</p>

<h3>Silver Dollar Closing at the End of the Month is Slightly Busy</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the banks were closed as usual. Because it was the end of the month, the money industry and various Chinese banks that were not closed were very busy. The market price for li was 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 1 hao 2 hu ban in the morning and 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 2 hao ban in the afternoon. The result was the same as the previous day.

<h3>Total Silver Interest for Last Month</h3>

If this is the case, the interest rate will be discussed at the meeting tomorrow, and the deposit interest rate will be around 4 taels and 95 qian.</p>
<h3>Securities: Bond Prices Rose Significantly Last Week</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Exceeded 6.1 Million</p>
<p>During the past week, the bond market conditions in this Shanghai securities market, though around the month-end settlement period for both the current and forward markets, saw a rise in bond prices and enthusiastic investment from all parties. Consequently, market activity was robust. Except for Friday, when the market was closed for settlement, Saturday saw the highest transaction volume, reaching over 1.56 million. The first two days of the week each recorded 1.3 to 1.4 million. On Thursday, it reached 1.01 million. Although the November term had closed on Wednesday, and the January term had not yet opened, the December term alone saw transactions exceeding 7.8 million. Total turnover for the week reached 6.185 million, with the 1924 Customs Surtax Bond being the most active, followed by the 1927 Consolidation Bond and the Reorganization Bond. Specifically, the 1924 Customs Surtax Bond accounted for 211,500 yuan in the November term, 1.0405 million yuan in the December term, and 282,500 yuan in the January term. The Consolidation Bond accounted for 174,500 yuan in the November term, 1.034 million yuan in the December term, and 200,500 yuan in the January term. The Reorganization Bond accounted for 116,500 yuan in the November term, 743,500 yuan in the December term, and 236,000 yuan in the January term. The 1927 National Debt accounted for 146,000 yuan in the November term, 795,500 yuan in the December term, and 106,000 yuan in the January term. The 1927 Sixth-Year Consolidation Bond also performed well, with 42,500 yuan in the November term, 313,500 yuan in the December term, and 111,500 yuan in the January term. However, other bonds remained quiet, such as the Customs Duty bonds, which accounted for 45,500 yuan in the November term, 201,500 yuan in the December term, and 85,000 yuan in the January term. The 1927 Consolidated Bond accounted for 17,500 yuan in the November term, 82,000 yuan in the December term, and 85,000 yuan in the January term. Furthermore, the Post-Reorganization Bond only saw 47,000 yuan, the Seventh-Year Bond 110,000 yuan, the Financial Bond 60,000 yuan, and the Second Series of the Twenty-fifth Year Bond 30,000 yuan. There were no transactions in the continued series bond. Spot transactions totaled 200,290 yuan, with the 1924 Customs Surtax Bond accounting for 116,500 yuan, the Reorganization Bond for 31,400 yuan, the Post-Reorganization Bond for 12,000 yuan, the Customs Duty Bond for 16,000 yuan, and other bonds only accounting for 4,000 to 5,000 yuan each. Additionally, ten shares of Chinese Merchant Securities were traded. As for the changes in bond prices, due to the favorable political situation and progress in the reorganization of domestic and foreign debts through the efforts of the financial industry, the prospects are promising. Therefore, the bond market environment is excellent, and investment in public bonds is more widespread than before. The enthusiasm for buying has increased, leading to a substantial recovery in bond prices due to strong demand. The robust market conditions are unprecedented in recent years. Among them, the Consolidation Bond rose nearly five yuan, the Reorganization Bond rose three yuan, and the 1924 Customs Surtax Bond rose approximately two yuan. Even the Sixth-Year Consolidation Bond rose by more than four yuan and seventy-eight cents compared to the previous week. Spot trading of the 1924 Customs Surtax Bond, Consolidation Bond, and Reorganization Bond is scarce on the market, leading to significant price increases. Only the Seventh-Year Bond and the 1927 Consolidated Bond remained relatively stable, while the 1927 National Debt experienced a slight contraction. A summary of the high, low, rise, and fall of various bond prices during the past week is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Cotton Market Continues Downstream</h3>
<p>Yesterday, unfavorable news from the American cotton market in Liverpool and weak hedging in the South caused a slight upward trend at the close. Futures prices rose by one to four points, while spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures fell by four to six points, and spot prices fell by twelve points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by fifteen points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly following the American cotton market but weakened further due to local short selling. Pingle fell by three rupees, forward contracts fell by four rupees, Oomra near-term and forward contracts fell by three rupees, and Barosi fell by four rupees. (Telegraph from the 29th)</p>

<h3>Grain: River Down Rice Market Dark and Declining</h3>
<p>Settlement Period Trend Slows</p>
<p>Bian Yin Yuan Falls by Two Cents</p>
<p>Keng Rice Prices Are Maintained at a Premium</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over forty cargo vessels arrived from downriver. Sales on the main street were sluggish due to the approaching month-end settlement. However, sentiment stabilized slightly due to the cloudy weather, and the price of high-quality Keng rice remained firm, opening at around 14.5 yuan. The market for paddy rice from Pudong was weak, with prices gradually declining by the cent. Yangxian rice was scarce, and supply of Dujian rice was limited, so prices remained stable. Early sales of coastal rice were better, but the market turned quiet in the afternoon. Coastal rice arriving in Shanghai was diverted elsewhere, causing the trend to stagnate and prices to soften slightly. Top-grade coastal rice still opened at 12 yuan. Bian Yuan rice from the north and west roads arrived continuously, causing prices to gradually decline by two cents. Sales of cloudy and poor-quality rice were particularly weak, falling another two cents, with the top price opening at 10.5 yuan.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, over twenty cargo vessels arrived from downriver, and sales were extremely flat. Initially, the market was expected to improve due to the rainy weather, but sluggish sales led to a stable situation. High-quality Keng rice from Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongzhou remained firm, while sales of thin rice and early rice from the southern region were even more sluggish. Market prices continued to decline, and all parties shortened their positions. However, there was no attempt to discount particularly high-quality rice, suggesting a potential for price increases. Yangxian and Dujian rice appeared stable, with active sales in rural areas, making it difficult for prices to fall. General sales of Bian Yin Hua rice remained mediocre, with prices in this region only declining slightly compared to the northern market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Daily Train Sugar Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Raw Sugar and White Sugar Also Rise by Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received a production area telegram indicating no electricity due to the week. The Chamber of Commerce market traded strong and the market atmosphere turned stronger, with quite a few transactions. Dutch sugar #24 raw sugar and white sugar traded at a high price of 7.5 taels, with high-quality goods at 7 taels and 5.5 qian. Fine-ground white sugar traded at 7 taels and 5.75 qian, a sudden increase of five cents compared to the previous day, and the market was firm. #20 Medium white sugar traded at 6 taels and 7 qian. #8 Dutch red traded at 6 taels and 3 qian, followed by 6 taels and 2 qian and 2.5 fen. The market was not weak. The trend of daily train sugar was even stronger, with even less top-grade goods, creating a situation of demand exceeding supply. At the beginning of the market, N Mark traded at 7 taels and 7 qian, YT Mark traded at 7 taels and 5.5 qian, TK Mark traded at 7 taels and 6 qian, TM Mark traded at 7 taels and 1 qian, YP Mark traded at 7 taels and 9.5 qian, Meiji YRO Mark traded at 6 taels and 9 qian, J Mark traded at 8 taels and 1 qian, and SH Mark traded at 7 taels and 2.5 qian. The market was still active, and prices were called higher by five cents, although there were few inquiries, the market was firm and supported. Only Hua Xinhao opened the market with 180 bags of spot raw sugar and white sugar at a price of 7 taels and 5 qian, which was quite popular.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Stone Pier Dried Longan Market Price Inverted</h3>
<p>Sales of Stone Pier dried longan have been sluggish recently. The previous shipments have been in stock for almost a month without being sold. The cost is above 21 taels, but the current selling price of 20 taels is also lacking buyers. Although the land price has been loosened, the price of Shen still needs 20 taels and a half, resulting in an inverted price and a gradual stagnation. Moreover, with the Western New Year approaching, there is little hope in the short term. However, small quantities of goods are still being shipped out, but they are also cheaper by six or seven qian compared to before.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Lifeless Last Week</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Only Over a Hundred Bales</p>
<p>During the past week, the silk market in Shanghai was extremely sluggish. Natural disasters and man-made calamities occurred one after another in markets such as New York and Lyon, and the economy became increasingly unstable. Most silk mills have shut down, silk consumption has decreased significantly, and inventories have soared. No one is paying attention to Chinese silk. Even if the telegrams are not forwarded, domestic silk mills in Shanghai and the inland areas have some demand for yellow and white factory silks, but the appetite for purchasing is limited. Manufacturers say that the silk itself is not cheap, and the market is still stable. Transactions of yellow and white coarse silk from British and Indian firms are also rare, and prices remain flat and sluggish. The Yokohama silk market has experienced a sharp decline in silk prices due to the impact of the great earthquake. During the week, the Shanghai silk market was lifeless, with a total transaction volume of just over a hundred bales and a turnover of over seven hundred bales. The price of overseas Chinese silk continues to fall, with high prices but no market. More than thirty silk mills in Shanghai, which reluctantly started work at the end of the week, have been unable to sustain operations due to weak sales to Europe. Two factories, including Yu Feng, have continued to shut down. The market prices of Chinese silk in the European and American markets at the end of last week are listed below (New York: price per pound in gold dollars; Lyon: price per kilogram in francs):</p>
<p>| Silk Type | New York | Lyon | Silk Type | New York | Lyon |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Superior Shanghai Raw Silk | 2.45 | 277 | Superior Dried Raw Silk | 1.90 | 170 |</p>
<p>| Superior Shanghai Raw Silk | 2.00 | 225 | Medium Dried Raw Silk | 1.40 | 121 |</p>
<p>| Medium Shanghai Raw Silk | 1.20 | 177 | Inferior Dried Raw Silk | 1.00 | 95 |</p>
<p>| Inferior Shanghai Raw Silk | 1.05 | 125 | Superior Coarse Raw Silk | 1.55 | 135 |</p>
<p>| Superior Shandong Raw Silk | 2.05 | 188 | Inferior Coarse Raw Silk | 0.95 | 90 |</p>
<p>| Superior Sichuan Raw Silk | 2.00 | 190 | Superior White Silk | 0.75 | 78 |</p>
<p>| Superior Gray Raw Silk | 1.15 | 20 |</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Iron Sheets Sold Out Immediately Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>Recently, the demand for 18-gauge black iron sheets has been very strong among various groups. The goods are sold out as soon as they arrive. Yesterday, Gonghexiang and New Taikoo had shipments arriving, with a total of over 2,000 bundles. All were purchased by groups from Tianjin, Niuzhuang, and the local enamel industry. Therefore, the market supply remains scarce, and the price is 12 taels and 2.5 qian per picul.</p>

<h3>New Method for Treating Fishbone Obstruction in Throat</h3>
<p>— Ms. Fang Yun</p>
<p>Yesterday, at Dr. Xie Liheng's clinic in Ningkang Lane, North Zhejiang Road, I saw a person seeking treatment for a fishbone stuck in their throat. They could hardly open their mouth and were in great pain. Dr. Xie immediately mixed equal parts of rice vinegar and warm water in a cup and had the patient rinse their throat frequently. After three rinses, the pain disappeared in less than ten minutes. Everyone was amazed. Dr. Xie said that immersing animal bones in hydrochloric acid quickly makes them soft because the lime content has been dissolved. Therefore, I have transferred this method to treat bone obstruction. However, because of the strong acidity, I worry about damaging the teeth and throat skin, so I added water to reduce its strength and limit it to the throat cavity and not the oral cavity. This is faster than swallowing rice balls or olives. Checking the ability of acid to dissolve lime is a common method, but applying it to treat bone obstruction in the throat is truly ingenious and simple, so I am publishing it.</p>

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Journey</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(25) From Dalian to Shanghai</p>
<p>"I've decided to go back to Shanghai," I suggested to Old Yang several times.</p>
<p>"Why? If you stay here longer, perhaps Dalian can secure a better position for you. Moreover, can you be sure of making a living if you return to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>Indeed, that last question of his repeatedly stopped me. Now that the schools have already opened for the fall semester, there's no way I can squeeze in. And I'm even less confident about other jobs. Besides, my friends in Shanghai probably think I'm returning from a grand tour of the north, but little do they know I'm actually sneaking back in a wretched state. Thus, I had no choice but to let fate carry me along, just like when I first set out for the north. But in the end, I still left Dalian.</p>
<p>"It seems destiny has ordained it this way... No, I'm struggling against destiny!" That's what I thought when I left Shanghai. Now I'm thinking it again. But isn't this also a trick of destiny?</p>
<p>I'm immensely grateful to Old Yang for kindly seeing me off onto the ship to Shanghai.</p>
<p>On the ship, an unpleasant incident occurred. To avoid the dust raised by the sailors working, I stood by a quiet window to look at the sea view. Suddenly, a Japanese steward, like a rat, came over and ordered me to leave. This really angered me, but I knew that the Japanese have a despicable habit of bullying the Chinese while fearing Westerners. Moreover, if I let him know I was a first-class passenger, I would have the freedom to stand anywhere. So I said to him in English,</p>
<p>"Mr. What do you do! I am passenger in first class…" Immediately, the Japanese steward ran away. If I had been an Englishman, he might have given me a hundred-degree bow.</p>
<p>During the two or three days at sea, my mind was also ceaselessly stirred by thoughts. All the past, present, and future joys, sorrows, excitements, worries, and fantasies surged and transformed in my mind one after another.</p>
<p>Because of the death of love, because of the breakdown of friendship, because of the coercion of life, because of a new longing after disillusionment, I resolutely resolved to part with Jiangnan for a long time. In the freezing cold, I waved my trembling hand and wandered north. But who would have thought that this was just a dream-seeking journey? After drifting in the frigid north for only half a year, I stumbled back in a wretched state. But isn't this also a vague longing? The most pressing question is how to make a living. Given that major question, what possibility do you have of an ideal that transcends your own situation?</p>
<p>However, finally, amid the chaos of thought and transformation, the ship docked on the shores of Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Ah, Shanghai, this vagrant of mine has finally thrown himself into your arms!"</p>
<p>A rickshaw carried me and my two shabby bags to a hotel in the bustling center of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Without resting from the fatigue of the journey, I went to look for several friends I was thinking of. But to my surprise, none of them were around. Dejectedly, I walked back, but in front of the New World, I bumped into Old Xu.</p>
<p>"What sea breeze blew you back to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Who knows, maybe my soul was lost in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>I offer this piece to Bi to commemorate our dead love, even though you won't find a single word about us inside.</p>
<h3>The Education Society of Great China University</h3>
<p>— Xin Yan</p>
<p>It is true that the emergence of academic groups like bamboo shoots after a spring rain is a good phenomenon and a sign of the school's glory. But further speaking, in addition to seeking breadth in quantity, there is also a need to seek perfection in quality. In other words, in addition to promoting fame, there is also a need to hope for the reality to match. A good name should be based on substance. When the quality is fully realized, the quantity will naturally be commensurate, because the superiority of quality over quantity is only a matter of scope, and it does not lose its soundness. If the quantity exceeds the quality, then there is a danger of a huge, clumsy object that is unwieldy. Therefore, it is better to be practical. The Education Society of Great China University has been operating in the past and striving in the future based on this spirit of not asking for harvest but only asking for cultivation, educating for the sake of education, and researching for the sake of research. The value of the Education Society of Great China University lies in this, and it is also different from other groups.</p>
<p>The Education Society does not have any background and no narrow-mindedness. Any student who is interested in education and wants to do in-depth research, regardless of department, can join at any time. An executive body is produced by all members, not called a committee but called an executive council. There is no chairman, only a chief and deputy chief. Others include clerical, administrative, storage, lecture, communications, publishing, editing, accounting, visitation, and investigation. Each executive does not pursue empty fame and specializes in practical work. The following have been carried out: (1) Experts are invited to give lectures at least twice a month. The appointed experts include Mr. Xie Xunchu, Chen Heqin, Liao Shicheng, and others. (2) The editing of publications. In order to work, another editorial committee has been formed to prepare a comprehensive and applicable high school normal school education curriculum outline within this half year, which is progressing very successfully. The educational discussion blackboard newspaper that was initially published will be temporarily suspended. (3) Alumni communication. This is an opportunity to continue our research and expand its scope. Members should not break away from the association after graduating and leaving the school. At the same time, the members in school also hope that their pioneering team will often report some front-line military information and response strategies. (4) Cooperative reading. Each member should read at least one newly published book, extract the outline, print it, and distribute it to all members for reference and mutual learning to achieve the effect of cooperation. (5) Debate. The focus is on training eloquence. Knowledge is important, but the ability to express oneself should not be neglected. Especially in education, because education is a social undertaking, those engaged in education have the spirit of reaching and enabling others. Therefore, the skill of expressing emotions is valued by us. (6) Discussion group. This organization is almost a variation of regular classes and has the opportunity to explore freely, avoiding the shortcomings of teaching what is not learned and learning what is not used. Every time it is held, a professor is invited to attend and provide guidance, and questions are raised and discussed at will. (7) The student practice education section. Every semester, there must be the establishment of a people's night school. This is certainly a good place for our experiments. The rest, such as our school's kindergarten and middle school, can also provide our practice at a reasonable time. (8) Visitation and investigation. The investigation officer will formulate many forms and inspection points, wanting to at least have a general understanding of Shanghai's education. Now, I will report on the situation of the first visitation and express my gratitude to the several institutions that earnestly guided us.</p>
<h3>High-Achieving Students from Zhizhi University: Ms. Dai Weijun and Qian Shihua</h3>
<p>— (Bing)</p>
<p>November 6th was a gloomy, misty, and chilly day. It was the date we had confirmed for our visit. Each member's eagerness to seek harmony was fervent, and the desire to uphold the pre-arranged agreement undoubtedly surpassed any fear of the dreary weather. Filled with unwavering hope, we boarded a specially hired bus heading towards the southern part of the city. The sparse trees of the countryside were unfamiliar to those of us who had never ventured into the countryside. On the swaying bus, we divided the tasks and finalized the plan. We arrived at the Shanghai County Education Bureau and proceeded inside, passing long corridors with slogans written on the walls, instilling a sense of solemn confidence. After a brief wait communicated by the doorkeeper, Director Shi Yangyong emerged and greeted us with great respect, leading us into a conference room resembling a waterside pavilion. It was evident at first glance that the building was converted from a dilapidated temple. Director Shi personally welcomed us and served tea. He then provided a detailed report on various items, demonstrating the attitude of an educator and lacking any bureaucratic airs. He managed the county's budget of over 100,000 appropriately, ensuring that resources were fully utilized. While other organizations might create positions solely to accommodate personnel, the school education and social education departments of the bureau were managed by a single individual. According to the report, there was no decrease in the workload. Before departing, each of us received over ten different kinds of educational publications, with exceptionally rich content, demonstrating the bureau's diligent efforts. Nearby, we visited public school gardens with flower trees and flowerbeds, as well as peculiar birds and animals. On average, hundreds of migrants visit each day. There were also many children playing in the gifted children's school. The gifted children's school is the First Experimental Primary School, which is designed for gifted children. After a brief tour, we felt that there was much room for improvement. In the afternoon, we visited the Wuben Middle School. Thanks to the enthusiastic guidance of an old classmate, we were able to see everything in great detail. Finally, we went to the Municipal Education Bureau, which was the main destination of this trip. Prior to our visit, the bureau had sent a reply expressing their welcome. However, due to the extreme busyness of the staff, they hastily provided a general overview of the entire bureau. Afterwards, the staff member who initially received us delegated another staff member to accompany us on a tour. Everywhere we looked, we saw evidence of meticulous organization and a tense work environment. The publications compiled by the bureau were exquisitely designed and widely subscribed to from various regions. They also presented us with a copy.</p>
<p>Although the Education Society is only a year old, it is indeed a pragmatic and research-oriented organization, maintaining the true essence of education. Its sole purpose is to pursue knowledge for the sake of knowledge, to explore educational theories and methods, to seek improvements in education, and to strive for the fulfillment of a satisfying life. Therefore, individuals or groups sharing the same goals can likely contribute to the society's mission. The Education Society has established a correspondence division, which is of utmost significance, as our ultimate goal is to fulfill our mission and ensure that the society's founding purpose is not affected by personnel changes. I believe that education is such, and I fear that all construction projects cannot escape this principle. China's various construction projects are still in their infancy. Each experience gives us a pitiful impression. Without humbly accepting good advice and seeking improvement, we will never catch up with others.</p>

<h3>On the Study of Law</h3>
<p>— One</p>
<p>Law School Law Research Association Edition</p>
<p>The Law Research Association of the Law School is not only a powerful academic research group within the school, praised by fellow students, and regarded favorably by the school authorities, but also attracts considerable attention from the academic circles of Shanghai. Just as we know that Datong University students have the "Wanbai Literature and Arts Society," the College of Law and Politics has the "Guangming Society," and Tongji University has the "Qing Society," the Law Research Association is a product of the last semester. The "Fa Guang Bao" (Law Light Newspaper) it publishes has already reached its fifth issue. Students have a copy in hand, and many external requests are received. Other activities, such as inviting celebrities to give lectures, holding lectures, and practicing litigation, are all attracting attention, and the newspaper also publishes articles from time to time. Despite the above achievements, the association members still believe that they are not satisfied, demonstrating the spirit of knowing one's limitations after learning. Therefore, at the fourth executive committee meeting, it was decided to publish a special issue called "On the Study of Law." The content includes law, politics, economics, and other social sciences. In addition to collecting the association's outstanding works, professors and well-known scholars were invited to contribute articles. We heard that Mr. Junliang, Guo Yuanjue, Wang Qufie, He Chengkui, Zhu Fuyan, Zhang Yao, Qian Chengjun, Liao Wei, Pan Shenjunru, and Lu Dingkui have agreed to contribute. The thirty-thousand-word treatise is expected to be spectacular. At the same time, efforts are being made to beautify it. For a group of students who are still studying, to be able to have such an initiative is truly admirable. We are eagerly waiting for it. However, economics is crucial. Therefore, a fundraising committee was organized and is now underway. It is estimated that more than five hundred yuan will be needed. It is divided into groups to solicit donations from the outside, from teachers and students. We have obtained a general fundraising notice, which is excerpted below to get a glimpse of its past achievements and the original intention of publishing the special issue.</p>
<p>In recent years, the country has been in turmoil, with internal and external difficulties. The main cause is naturally attributed to the problem of national ability. Today's authorities are making every effort to achieve the success of democratic constitutionalism. However, this task is heavy and depends not only on a few talented and capable people, but also on the ability of the majority of citizens to understand the rule of law and judge policies. If we cannot make efforts to remedy this at this time, I am afraid that academic decline and national power will wither forever. How can we talk about democratic constitutionalism or even doctrines and policies? The members of this association carefully study law, politics, and economics, aiming to promote and develop them, and to lay the foundation for cultivating democratic constitutionalism. The purpose lies herein.</p>
<p>This association has been established for half a year. Although there are no surprising achievements, there have been considerable contributions. In terms of research, two discussion meetings have been held, and there are many insightful and profound opinions. In terms of lectures, celebrities such as Dr. Lu Jinhou and Master Ying Chengyi, as well as association members, have given many lectures. In terms of litigation practice, four court sessions have been opened. And the most important thing is the "Fa Guang Bao" (Law Light Newspaper), which has already been published in five issues. The content is not perfect, but it is praised by the students. The association is deeply ashamed and grateful. Therefore, although there are the above achievements, if we say that we have really gained something, we dare not believe it. If we say that we have gained nothing, we dare not believe it because of shame and gratitude. The more one learns, the more one realizes one's deficiencies. The members of this association dare not be arrogant or selfish. They want to contribute what they have learned to all the students and to the association for further exploration and to achieve practical results. Therefore, there is a decision to issue a special issue.</p>
<p>Now that the decision has been made, funding is naturally the primary issue. Although there are nearly a hundred members in the association, the past expenses for publishing publications and practice have been quite large. In accordance with the principle of unselfishness in this school, there is a separate proposal to solicit donations from the outside. Therefore, a fundraising committee was organized and is about to begin. After raising five hundred yuan, the highlights of all the achievements and materials of the association will be compiled into a four- or five-hundred-page giant book. It is hoped that all teachers and students will appreciate its importance and generously donate money to support it. Then, small contributions can make a big difference, and many trees can support the building. In the future, the publication will be completed, so that the foundation of the association will become stronger, and the knowledge of members and students will increase day by day. Then, the benefits will be immeasurable. All members of the association will be grateful and bow a hundred times. This announcement.</p>
<h3>Before and After Class</h3>
<p>— Junping</p>
<p>"Jing, I just saw the announcement. An American PhD is coming to our school to give a lecture next period, so I'm not going to Sociology next period. Do you want to go and listen to the American PhD's lecture?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, Ying pushed open my door. When she saw me reading, she covered my book with her hand, as if afraid that I wouldn't listen to her.</p>
<p>"Is it worth making such a fuss about an American PhD lecture? Haven't you heard one before?" I, who don't like listening to lectures, was a little selfish.</p>
<p>"You have to know that the lecturer is not Chinese, but an American PhD!"</p>
<p>"I know."</p>
<p>"How do you know? You haven't even seen the announcement."</p>
<p>"Do you know if I've seen the announcement? The lecturer is Dr. Lei Na, a professor at the University of Michigan and a special lecturer at our school. Today is his first time lecturing at the school."</p>
<p>Ying nodded and didn't reply. She already knew I didn't want to listen to Dr. Lei Na's lecture, so she turned around and left.</p>
<p>A small classroom had more than thirty chairs and a small podium, leaving almost no space. The area of the classroom was so small, and so many chairs were placed in it, so naturally the distance between the chairs was also very small. Even the aisle left in the middle was so narrow.</p>
<p>The school seemed to be especially accommodating to us. About forty people who had selected Sociology were assigned to this classroom. In this way, students who arrived late naturally had no chairs to sit on. So they had to go to other classrooms to get some chairs and bring them in. This small classroom seemed to become even smaller.</p>
<p>This had almost become a routine for every Sociology class. Before class, thirty or forty students would all walk quickly towards this small classroom. After the class bell rang, several chairs would be brought in from outside and crammed into the front of the classroom.</p>
<p>But today's situation was a little different. The classroom was not only less crowded than before, but the air also seemed to be much milder. This was naturally because some students had gone to listen to the lecture.</p>
<p>"Why are so many people absent today?"</p>
<p>Sociology professor Mr. Wang came in with his comical face. He habitually put on a kind smile, first glanced at us with his near-sighted glasses, then slowly put down the chalk and attendance book he was holding in his hand. He felt that there must be other reasons why so many people were suddenly absent, so he opened his mouth and said this sentence in a questioning tone.</p>
<p>"Hee hee hee..." The students couldn't help but laugh when they saw his comical face. His words were blurred by the laughter.</p>
<p>"They have gone to listen to the lecture," a sanctimonious student replied.</p>
<p>"Lecture? Who's here to give a lecture?"</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was surprised when he heard the student say lecture.</p>
<p>"An American PhD," another student抢着答.</p>
<p>"..........................."</p>
<p>Mr. Wang was stunned. He opened the attendance book, took a pencil in his right hand, and called out the names one by one from top to bottom. When he called out a student's name, he glanced at the student's face, as if afraid that dishonest students would answer for others.</p>
<p>He called out the names one by one. After calling out "Mr. Zhao Zhenqing", he suddenly stopped. He thought that he had not paid attention and did not hear Zhao Zhenqing's reply of "Here". So he hurriedly called out again twice, "Mr. Zhao Zhenqing, Mr. Zhao..."</p>
<p>"Hahaha..." What followed was a burst of laughter from the students.</p>
<p>The classroom suddenly became lively. The sound of "Miss Miss" filled everyone's ears, as if the air in the entire classroom was attracted by "Miss". In this way, naturally the girls sitting in the corner suffered, their faces blushing, tightly closing their mouths, not daring to make a sound.</p>
<p>After Mr. Wang called the names, he closed the attendance book, opened the lecture notes that were missing a corner, took a piece of chalk, and began to lecture. So the twenty or so students sitting in this small classroom also fell silent.</p>

<h3>Roasted Chestnuts and Drama</h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>After class, most of the students left, carrying their schoolbags, and returned to their dormitories. Only a dozen or so members of the ×× Drama Troupe were still lingering in the lounge, busy organizing props because they were going out for public performances again in the next few days.</p>
<p>"It's terrible, I can't get into the emotions of Camille. Mr. ×× always wants me to play the part. Am I doomed?" Fang said, half happy and half angry.</p>
<p>"Because you can empathize, that's why he wants you to do it. Why doesn't he assign me?" Kuai Touqin retorted immediately. Listening carefully, the sound came from that fat face, giving people a sense of comicality.</p>
<p>"You're not bad either. You have the talent for comedy." Lin, who was organizing a cloak, turned her head and complimented her.</p>
<p>Suppressed laughter filled the room.</p>
<p>Someone shouted, "You're so happy, but you didn't even notify me!" Gao Ganzi's Biao jumped in from outside, slapping a package of something on Lin's back. The paper bag suddenly burst open, and many round things rolled all over the ground. Everyone scrambled to grab them.</p>
<p>"They're roasted chestnuts, very good, they're from Liangxiang," Qin said as she ate. Because her mouth was full of chestnuts, her face became even more flushed. "You always say I'm big, I should eat more." Her words were mixed with the cracking sound of chestnut shells and the clicking and munching sounds, so they were very vague. She bent down to pick them up and eat them. When people saw her rolling round back almost become a ball, the naughty Fang suddenly put on a serious face and asked, "Who brought this? Whose name is on it?"</p>
<p>"Where is it?" But before the words were finished, a burst of laughter almost shattered the small house. "Indeed, the characters and background are all round. It's hard for you to buy this bag of good chestnuts!" Lin laughed and pushed Gao Ganzi's arm with her elbow. Everyone heard this sentence and laughed again. The chestnuts in Fang's hand were scattered on the ground. Many people used their hands to rub their stomachs, saying, "Oh, I can't breathe!"</p>
<p>"You're laughing at me! I'll play Pu Yudangsi tomorrow. You be careful. I won't be your matchmaker. Let's see if your Camille will be in a hurry." Qin pointed at Fang with her finger and glared at Lin again.</p>
<p>Everyone saw that Qin's mouth had stopped. They looked and saw that the chestnuts on the ground had disappeared. They quickly asked, "Where are the chestnuts? Are they all gone?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, you guys let me eat them. Why are you asking?"</p>
<p>"No one let you eat them," Fang questioned her playfully.</p>
<p>"When you were laughing, I took the liberty of doing it for you."</p>
<p>"Oh, we were fooled!" Many people said in unison, like a tide overturning the embankment.</p>
<p>Since the chestnuts were eaten, everyone had to sit down quietly and discuss the drama. "People say that when European scripts are moved to the Chinese stage, they become oriental imitations and lack enthusiasm. In fact, this is not an exaggeration. Our female protagonists are often too shy and don't dare to express the emotions of the characters. Just like Huo Kesang in Cyrano, she is not a demure young lady in the oriental style who can play the role well. In many public performances,</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>the most critical part, such as the end of Act III, when Chris says goodbye to his new wife, must be so tense that the actor expresses the shaking soul of the character through various actions, conveying it directly to the shaking hearts of the audience. However, the Chinese Huo Kesang does not dare to kiss or hug. She just says stereotyped words calmly. Therefore, critics generally feel that the training of female actors is too lacking." Lin shook her long hair behind her head, ending her speech.</p>
<p>"What you said is not wrong, but it is easy to criticize others and difficult to criticize oneself. When it comes to oneself, one cannot take the lead. You say that they don't kiss or hug, that they are too neglectful. How can you know that the audience in front of the stage is also untrained Chinese audiences? If they did that, do you know what gossip they would say about this female protagonist? And the female actor's lover and other boyfriends would not want her to be too serious, right? You men are all selfish. What are you talking about?" Qin also opened her mouth today, I don't know if it was thanks to the fried chestnuts.</p>
<p>Fang, who was originally sitting on the windowsill, jumped down at this time and shouted, "Don't kill thousands of ants with one blow! Not every Chinese woman is a delicate young lady! Although I haven't received much training, I can't be like those people who want to show off but are afraid of being laughed at. If you can't put the soul of the character into your own body and make her move as much as possible, then there's no need to talk about art at all!"</p>
<p>The long-haired Lin whispered in Gao Ganzi's ear, "It can be seen that people need to be stimulated. We hope that her Camille will be successful this time." Then he started clapping first.</p>
<p>Gao Ganzi Biao also echoed with claps. Qin was especially happy that day. Her two fleshy palms clapped up and down, making uncoordinated and heavy sounds. At this time, the people in the lounge had gradually dispersed, leaving only a few. The evening sunlight faintly penetrated into the small house, illuminating the happy faces of the young people and emitting a bright light. Many boxes were arranged along the foot of the wall, swords, old feather crowns, etc. A bunch of withered artificial camellias lay quietly in the corner, symbolizing the life of the abandoned Camille.</p>
<p>A series of loud sounds came from the window, as if something had fallen from a high place. People immediately knew that Gao Ganzi was also discussing something. "When our troupe was first established, there was a society here and a troupe there. It was very lively. After a while, they suddenly became indifferent. Now, who is willing to work hard except for our troupe?"</p>
<p>Just as others were about to continue his words, everyone's eyes converged on the square table. "What is this? Everyone, look!" Before the voice was finished, a handkerchief package had been grabbed and opened. "Tickets! They're the tickets from just now!" Fang shouted happily.</p>
<p>Smiles hung on everyone's faces. Before long, there were only many empty shells scattered on the ground. Only Qin did not eat. She smiled faintly and said, "If it weren't for me using a little trick, you would only care about eating and not about studying drama. Tomorrow, the success of Camille will be due to my tickets!" The dinner bell rang. After they left, many ticket shells were crowded on the ground, as if they were pre-reporting the appearance of the audience挤轧 tomorrow.</p>
