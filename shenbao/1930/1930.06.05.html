<p>時評</p>
<h3>再論殖民地之紛擾</h3>
<p>我嘗屢言之。人類之量力不甚相遠也。人類之智識不甚相遠也。苟竭其必死之心。有進無退之念。所差實無幾何也。但因世人自來有一種相傳之心理。以爲弱者。斷不能抗敵强者對於强者。惟有屈服之一途。迨自歐洲大戰而後。所謂世界之强者。亦現窮竭之狀。有時不能不向弱者乞助。於是弱者已窺破强者之力量。咸知强弱之分。非一成不變之定則。人人苟能自奮。出必死之心。存有進無退之念。雖有遲速。終有達其目的之一日。此種相傳之心理。一經衝破。人人欲求自由平等之念。遂勃發而不能或阻。此世界殖民地之人民。所以羣起而求脫其覊紏也。</p>
<p>然而世界之强者。自歐戰平息以後。旣忘其緊急時求助於弱者之狀况。且欲急求恢復歐戰以前之威權。不但對於弱者求助之諾言。口惠而實不至。又以經濟之關係。視此弱者之殖民地。尤爲富源之所在。更不願稍有所解放。此殖民地之弱者。旣覺悟於心。復憤恨於中。遂至無時無地不羣起而思與强者一决成敗。其所用之方法與手叚。雖各有不同。而其紛起而奮爭。遍世界之殖民地。固無一不有此現狀也。</p>

<h3>青島漁業衰落原因</h3>
<p>青島通信山東沿海一帶素稱産魚最富之區而膠澳一地因内海水淺多灘漁業尤爲各處之冠惟近年來漁民仍沿用舊法不知改良官廳亦未加以提倡任其衰落竟使大好産魚之區一蹶不振日本漁民遂得乘機侵我領海奪我漁權殊可痛惜茲將關於漁業情形調查如下</p>
<p>沿海漁塲之調查（一）登窰港位於沙子口區登窰村南距青島約七十里以前春冬兩期漁業甚盛即墨境靑山黃山之捕漁者均以此處爲售賣塲現該處捕漁者已寥寥無幾不足稱爲漁港矣（二）沙子口位於青島東方距靑約六十里爲全區最盛之漁業港該港可分三處即沙子口海廟灣泉子崖（即姜哥莊灣）該口爲去外海捕魚之中心出産魚量爲全區之冠（三）石老人灣該灣位於沙子口之西距靑約四十里灣内多石水不甚深只春季有在此捕刀魚者（四）山東頭灣位於石老人西距靑約三十五里春期在該灣捕鮹魚者爲最多其餘期間則均係張釣捕雜魚類（五）小港（又名靑島港）該港位於台東區之東南距靑約三十里春期産刀魚烏魚最多（六）四方湖島子問以前亦有一漁塲現因受工廠影響已無形消滅（七）沙嶺莊後灣該灣位於四滄區沙嶺莊北距靑約三十五里二十年前尙有在此捕魚者現已受工廠影響漁塲消滅（八）滄口灣該灣位於青島之北距靑約三十里三十年前尙爲漁業塲今則捕魚者多到外口惟秋季來此裝載果物之商船尙不少（九）女姑山灣該灣位於滄口之北距靑約四十五里該處産蛤蠣　子等最多以前亦爲膠州灣内漁業繁盛之區近來熘業衰落惟春期尙有捕刀魚者秋冬期捕魚者則甚寥寥（十）陰鳧位於膠州灣之西岸距靑約十海里該島三面環海人民生活除農業占十之三四外餘皆恃捕魚爲生捕魚時期全在春季一汛全年賴此生活（十）（一）薛家鄡黄島水靈山其情形與陰島同（十）（二）竹岔島位於青島西南距靑約二十海里地勢四面環海漁業以春季爲最盛産魚之富不亞於沙子口</p>
<p>漁業今昔之比較　查三十年前青島全區有百六十餘村爲漁業村計沙子口區約二十餘村張村區南部約八九村台東區約二十餘村四滄區哟討論三十餘村仙家寨區西部十餘村海西全區七十餘村每村漁戶約佔全村戶數之半現在除海西區尙以捕魚爲副業外至海東方面只沙子口區尙有三十餘戶其餘業漁者極少以現在與三十年前較直等於百與十之比查漁業衰落原因不外下列數種一青島自闢爲通商口岸後生活程度日高漁業收穫不能增加因而輟業者甚多二漁民株守舊法對於漁具及捕魚方法不知改良三感受經濟困難四海盜充斥五苛稅　捐太重六政府不加提倡　民無力改良七民三以來日人往往侵入我國領海捕魚致漁民收入減少有此種種原因青島漁業遂日就衰落成一蹶不振之勢（五月三十一日）</p>

<h3>裁判不公</h3>
<p>（惠京通訉）中日排球初賽於二十六日下午三時開始裁判爲原及坂本兩氏</p>
<p>中國排球其種度相去極遠故是日比賽日人之參觀者寥寥無幾蓋彼等自以爲必勝而無疑不料其結果有大出人意料以外者吾隊球員亦自信以爲必勝故不大留意開始未久即屢爲日人壓劈關門紀分牌上轉瞬日旗下懸九分而我國旗下只得三分而已此其輕敵之心有以致之也至此乃知亦不能太過輕敵之心有以致之也至此乃知亦不能太過輕敵於是急起直追然未兩三回合日隊已得十一分我隊四分易地再戰吾隊乃召集緊急會議討論對敵方法及再開始果即將球奪回由李福申發球連趕數分紀錄遂爲十一分平又經曾經全發球連獲三分乃以十四比十一駕乎日人之上惟至此乂停止不進日人屢用左右包抄法乘我三路之空虚連得五分又以十六比十四追出我隊我隊乃宣佈停戰以殺敵氣果然開始再賽則由朱祖成連獲三分結果又成十七與十六比我隊點先日隊在網發球又追出我隊一分徐亨又趕回兩分遂成十九與十八比至此兩隊皆嚴守陣脚不能進展經數次往還又爲日隊三路中連得兩分我國應拔隊焦急萬分蓋以日公證人之偏私袒獲明日張胆奪取分數屢謂吾隊以手過網觸網等我隊長亦經數次申辯惟仍無效傍觀者大爲咆哮使我隊不可與之再賽屢經我領隊等勸諭始復再賽兩隊又無甚進展至曾經全發球乃獲二分紀錄遂爲二十平兩隊爭鬥益劇時仍有一二次違例受罰者應援隊更大駡不已此局卒爲日本勝爲二十二與二十之比</p>
<p>中國應援隊憤極有拔隊而出者有仍不欲去而守候如何結果者人皆以爲在此種評判之下雖有絶技亦無能爲也</p>
<p>第二局開始陳錫炳連獲三分曹廷贊亦獲一分先聲奪人日隊大爲慌亂乃振察精神二路右翼連劈數次我隊朱黎徐李曾五員大將均大敗而返全無分數幸我隊之丘廣燮黎連楹亦連將敵將五員擊退故紀錄仍爲四與一之比日隊又獲二分於是連戰十餘次均未分勝負又過十餘分鐘然分數不過九與五比在此一局中國常常占先評判員之態茺亦大變我隊員亦甚鎭靜各能盡其所長聨絡工夫亦大有可觀及至陳從超發球全隊精神抖抖丘廣燮連劈數球朱祖成與黎連楹合作在綱前舉球不過略高於網即乘勢急劈下迅雷不及掩耳連得八分雖日人亦奮鬥奪回三分然曹廷贊發球時又連得四分日人至此無力挽回中國卒以二十一對八獲勝</p>
<p>第三局日人不知何故將善劈之右翼更換其始日隊猶鼓其餘勇兩隊尙相持不下久之漸漸身疲力竭軍無鬥志我隊則着着進攻凡發球者均無空手而回其中猶以曹廷贊得分最多及至二十對六朱黎急欲决勝完場屢欲獻其絶技惟操之太急舉球太低連連失敗幸分數相差極遠日隊無反攻之希望中華卒以二十一比八勝日人球術雖熟幼穉然亦不弱其救球甚快二路兩翼劈球亦甚得力惜經騐尙小訓練未到故終歸失敗</p>
<p>我隊丘廣爕在此一戰大立奇功　其所劈球或遠或近日人雖欲關門或爲其乘隙而入或由敵人指上飛過大多分數皆爲此君所得朱黎之合作快速劈球甚爲特色敵人不得不佩服</p>

<h3>中菲足球初賽</h3>
<p>五比零我國大勝</p>
<p>戴麟經連中三元立大功</p>
<p>周賢言奮身救球奏奇效</p>
<p>（東京通訉）二十七日午後零時二十分中菲足球隊初次交鋒於田徑賽場　震於兩隊威名來作壁上觀者達五萬人以上裁判員竹内虎生巡邊　濱田諭吉朝生要人結果上半時中國以三對○勝下半時復以二對○勝總結果中國以五比○大勝菲列濱俟二十九日再與日本决賽爭奪錦標茲將比賽經過詳情分述如下</p>
<h3>（一）八分鐘開紀錄</h3>
<p>開始接觸後雙方交戰異常勇敢我方處逆風故球常在我隊球門前盤旋危險萬狀幸鐵門周賢言把守如鐵桶否則殆矣至第八分鐘我隊右内鋒陳家球盤球直進衝破内衛絿線至球門前菲軍猛力搶撲陳即將球斜飛一脚輕輕傳與中鋒戴麟經戴不慌不忙舉足一蹴急而有力直撲球門由右角斜飛入網菲軍守門員萬萬不及救護我國遂勝第一球</p>
<h3>（二）半小時又一個</h3>
<p>其後菲軍努力反攻聲勢頗銳曾屢次罰角球亦未奏效菲軍前鋒個人技藝均尙不弱但連絡功夫太缺乏每次有攻門機會均踢出界線有一次我隊傾師出動内部空虚突被菲軍左翼盤球直來守門周賢言急離門救護菲軍脚快已離門十碼周返再趕已不能及祗見菲軍舉足踢球球竟越横木而過可謂坐失良機不再來矣至三十一分鐘時菲被罰角球由葉北華主踢一脚飛去球正落在菲軍門前雙方戰士混在一堆中鋒戴麟經以頭承球向球門一頂又入網内我隊勝第二球</p>
<h3>（三）戴麟經中三元</h3>
<p>厥後僅隔一分鐘孫錦順獲球傳與葉北華葉挾球飛駛直逼球門旋又傳與戴麟經戴脚頭微揚球又躍入網中我隊遂勝第三球於是拉拉隊高唱得勝之歌連日我國忍氣受辱此時始得稍爲發洩</p>
<h3>（四）第四個不算數</h3>
<p>菲軍旣負二球心猶不甘全軍下總攻擊令努力衝擊但因我隊内部實力非常充裕無計可逞至第三十八分鐘時我軍左翼葉北華獲球衝破敵之第二道防線順風一脚又進網内但裁判員過來謂係越位不算數於是前半局結果我隊以三對○獲勝</p>
<h3>（五）葉北華始奏功</h3>
<p>檸檬時間後雙方易地再戰我隊以陳光耀易陳家球爲右翼威勢更振但菲亦不示弱時時衝入内部防線雙方激戰久之毫無勝負至第二十八分鐘葉北華單槍匹馬深入敵境由左方十八分鐘葉北華單槍匹馬深入敵境由左方攻進一球奏第一功我隊勝第四球</p>
<h3>（六）孫錦順獲一球</h3>
<p>我軍乘戰勝餘威一路攻去勢如破竹未一分鐘葉北華得球傳與孫錦順孫三脚趕近球門向側角一脚球又入網我國勝第五球至是我隊復以馮佑運代葉北華雙方激戰久之並無紀錄結果我隊遂以五對○全勝</p>
<h3>（七）李寗鐵頭稱雄</h3>
<p>是日之戰我國隊員個個如生龍活虎日人觀衆均嘆止後防方面李寗之幾脚臥球與頭頂救出不少險球故日人羣尊之爲鐵頭蓋記實也茲將兩隊陣線錄下</p>

<p>第二局　我隊愈形得意飜弄敵陣擲虚隙處着着取分菲軍聨絡欠佳惟亦努力應付劇戰十餘合丘廣爕急擊以十一比六換塲是後菲隊奮起擊球漸確我軍後陣亦多失守緊追至十五比十四幾造成平手惟對方前排觸網黎連楹扣殺驚人分數增至十八比十四菲隊要求時間意欲挫我銳鋒續賽菲隊前排復犯越網曹廷贊陳錫炳之劈壓菲隊漸形不支比數爲二十對十五最後一分彼此拼命攻防佳技續出一來一往毫不相讓接戰至爲劇烈我隊率以二十一比十五得勝一洗初賽失敗之辱與菲列濱同列一勝一敗成績</p>

<p>比賽經過只見日軍縱横活躍猛擊銳攻初局我隊投手鍾友制球頗佳先死敵二人惟因防禦失愼日得兩人出壘後至二比三時强敵三壘右邊球遠滾至左翼而成本壘打一舉入三分我隊士氣之萎縮殆以此始是後各局日本益加暴威全軍猛攻而我隊守備漸形崩滅失策層出至敵人至十三分第四局我隊恢復兩點五六七局日人更加八分大勢已决第六局中陳運芳調任投手亦難阻敵聲威第八局接手蔡運平忍不能忍自任投手重責余獻三爲接手始得無事結果日本以二十一點對三大勝慘哉中國之敗</p>

<p>大會花絮錄</p>
<h3>選手年齡新紀錄</h3>
<p>大會開會第一日就出了許多新記錄而尤以選手年齡的新紀錄爲最有趣我國棒球選手馮恩錫君有的說五十四歲有的說四十七歲大槪是五十左右的人聽說孫子都有了不料事情竞無獨有偶日本網球手朝吹夫人確也不小今年芳齡四十二兒子已進了慶應大學了這兩位是大的古怪還有一位是小得稀奇的就是菲律濱的棒球選手S君今年纔十一歲大的球棒還比</p>
<h3>中菲女網球雙打表演</h3>
<p>下角自左至右李杏花李牡丹恩格約加里哥</p>
<p>他長他也居然出入於國際運動之場這二位是從遠東運動大會開始以來所没有的紀錄</p>
<h3>女生大呌「木村樣」</h3>
<p>菲律濱的跳高名將脫君一口氣跳到了二米把一般人看得目瞪口呆出聲不得日本的木村選手雖也不錯跳過了一米九六可是到這時候也有些懐疑不定還是再跳呢還是就此作罷决不下來後來一不成功二不過去到最後第三回實在興奮不起來了那時全塲靜寂無聲正在看究竟不料旁邊一羣女學生中大呌一聲「木村樣」把空氣冲破了</p>

<h3>勿齷龊呢多捧腹</h3>
<p>當中日籃球第一塲開戰以前兩國選手們都先到塲練習我國選手白衣白褲白鞋加之以胸前的紅地國徽鮮艶無比日本選手一律是灰色衣褲旁邊有個日本小姑娘說「像老鼠一樣齷龊來」等一回兩方外衣都脫去了日本選手黄衣白褲也很漂亮有個中國人對這小姑娘說「勿齷龆呢」弄得一般人棒腹大笑小姑娘也不禁浣然</p>

<p>考奎敎授之得名始於其吐藩（在中亞）探險遠征之成功此遠征之結果敎授對世界宣布發見一種古代文明之遺跡證明希臘波斯印度中國古代文化間有一種聨鎖之存在此發見爲近代最重要發見之一與古物探險學極有關係其發見之文畫由敎授携至印度備歷艱辛經過中亞許多大山其高峯有離海面一萬五千呎者最後得達柏林以所發見之奇畫珍藏於人類學博物院敎授於其發見曾有記述多種其最主要者爲「中亞佛敎的古物」全畫共四卷乃一煌煌鉅著云</p>

<p>屠格湼甫的小說是完成而有抑制的較强烈較無檢束的熱情的人非奥多耳杜思退益夫斯基的小說則是從他内中傾倒出來而並不入於無法則不規律的事實境界以外的什麽模型的他在靑年時代爲了革命底活動（這差不多没有比講談更進一步）被逮捕送到西比利亞去了四年他的慘苦的經騐在「死屋的追憶」之中演爲故事那鐵似的經騐入於他的靈魂中他便一生只是悲哀的人然而和他的慘苦一同恐怕作爲牠的結果罷有着對於凡有苦惱的人對於犯罪人和流浪人對於如他的小說之一所稱似的「受傷害受侮辱的人們」的偉大的同情他的最優美的作品「罪和罰」是可戰慄的深刻的東西貧窮的學生拉司柯爾尼柯甫犯了殘酷的殺人罪那動機並非嫉妬復仇搶刧之類普通的動機却是病底的主我主義的錯綜和對於生的鬱憤他向自己的戀人一個可憐的街頭的少女沙尼亞懺悔她便勸導他贖罪他委身於警察便被送到西比利亞去沙尼亞隨後到那里去跟從他她的獻身是在他的贖罪在這兩個孩子的受苦之中並不成着象徵主義者的杜斯退益夫斯基看見全俄羅斯並且夢想到全俄羅斯和全世界爲愛所贖時的未來他並不相信對於壓迫的救治之道是暴力在「鬼迷者」中他顯示着革命底陰謀的愚行和悲劇他以爲農夫是俄羅斯的希望將麥克沁高爾基現在向我們說不過是那時代的文學底及政治底理想的那些德性賦與農夫</p>
<p>在杜思退益夫斯基的一切小說中流露着的生的悲哀是往往被西方的讀者誤解爲病態的惟以人類有或種不健全的動機爲限這是病態的然而如此也不當非難小說家更過於因爲在報紙第一面揭載謀殺案火警拐誘且也揭載像北極飛行或者爲了尋求救助幾個自己的同胞之道的努力而斷送生命的或一外科醫的死似的美的人類底勇氣的記事而非難新聞記者這麽說並非杜思退益夫斯基從新聞採取材料這一種意思他是從普遍的生命採取材料的他的最大的小說「客拉馬助夫史弟」處理着現於全不重要的人們的弱點和困難的那善惡的問題在杜思退益夫斯基的全體之中並無「主人公」在而且女主人公不是爲電影而造的他們是太過哀切太過悲劇底太過眞實在杜思退益夫斯基的天才中所缺的唯一東西是諧謔感屠格湼甫有着牠具有頗蒼白的哲學底地有同情的性質的他們中間的最大者託爾斯泰只有着嚴肅而曲折的諧謔只有着微笑而無笑俄羅斯文學中哥郭里和柴霍甫之間是並無怎麽多的可笑味的</p>
<p>俄羅斯人往往是難以理解的但也並不比理解人類的其餘者更爲困難有人以爲被誤稱爲「心理」的斯拉夫人的氣質可以在我們貼近的隣人中看出來關於這點杜思退益夫斯基的最初的小說「窮人」似乎有着他實際上幾乎不知其作品的那迭更司的强的風味是深有意味的這是小小的圓的世界然而杜思退益夫斯基以爲本國民和本國文學從歐羅巴遠離這意思却顯示於他那對於託爾斯泰的「安那卡累泥那」的妙評說是京俄羅斯投寄一種偉大的東西於壓迫人類的諸問題的解决的能力而言這是俄羅斯能夠提出於西方世界的最明瞭的證據云云壓迫人類的諸問題不問東西都未經小說解决又人類性格的問題也一樣由小說提示着顯耀着却没有加以解决經由杜思退益夫斯基的俄羅斯來到我們這里者是傳達喚起情緒如在「客拉馬助夫兄弟」似的將興味撳入於散亂的細小事情頗硬固的根本底材料的他的力直至屠格湼甫及托爾斯泰的名至少被聞之後他没有被知於英吉利及亞美利加他那强烈的國民主義在國境阻止他然而他的人道底精神在一切國度至少有識的人們之間終於占了勝利現在杜思退益夫斯基是十九世紀的被公認的大巨匠之一了</p>
<p>俄羅斯的小說家將世界的重荷負於他們的雙肩上我們不能說那重荷是否增强了作爲藝術家的他們說他們是强大的他們的藝術是高貴而誠實的就儘夠了當一九一○年托爾斯泰死的時候他是全世界最傑出的文學者倘若他不過是一個小說家他就不會那麽樣世界底地受尊敬了罷倘若他不是小說家則他的作爲改革家及自由的鬥士的身分不會有那麽樣崇高了勇敢地使用自己的筆丨丨自己的人間性和自己的靈魂丨丨於非文學底鬥爭的文學者例如密耳頓及囂俄似的有過許多有的爲了「主義」犧牲自己的精力或時時擱置自己的藝術有的像擺侖似的棄筆而取劍托爾斯泰恐怕是試要將自己的藝術作爲對於自己較高的目的的邪魔的或無關係的東西而加以否定抑壓那有第一流創造力的唯一的藝術家了罷幸而那些目的直至他的創造底衝動已經表現於他的小說和故事爲止没有全然佔據他的心他在靑年時代是因襲的貴族和軍人並不在本性上却在外面的事情上是因襲底他那在克里米亞戰爭的經騐給材料於「綏白斯托波爾」及其他的戰爭故事那些作品立即帶了名聲來給他確立了他的文學底生涯那些作品的性質那些作品的主人公　照他自己所說是眞實而没有虚僞的誇張或感傷底光榮的影跡他將戰爭照那本來的樣看作人們發揮單純的盲目底勇氣的可恐的無益的東西當時他旣非平和主義者又非宣傳家實際皇帝是命令他從危險地帶退去的即在他的名聲煊赫而確實之後他也是較之文學倒是對於人和物抱着更多的興味的丨丨而這就是他的力的源泉他在鄉間的莊地消磨光陰努力敎育鄉村的孩子們改善農夫的狀態他在許多活動的當中寫了他的兩大小說「戰爭與和平」及「安那卡累泥那」</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Further Discussion on the Turmoil in Colonies</h3>
<p>I have repeatedly stated this: The physical strength of human beings is not that different from each other. The knowledge of human beings is not that different from each other. If one exhausts their will to die, and maintains a determination to advance without retreat, the differences are truly insignificant. However, because people have traditionally held a certain inherited psychology, believing that the weak can never resist the strong, and that the only option for the weak is to submit to the strong. Since the European War, the so-called strong nations of the world have also shown signs of exhaustion, and sometimes they have to beg for help from the weak. Thus, the weak have seen through the strength of the strong, and all know that the distinction between strong and weak is not an immutable rule. If everyone can strive for themselves, with a determination to die and a will to advance without retreat, although there may be slowness, there will eventually be a day to achieve their goals. Once this kind of inherited psychology is broken through, the desire for freedom and equality will erupt and cannot be stopped. This is why the people of the world's colonies have risen up to seek to break free from their shackles.</p>
<p>However, since the end of the European War, the strong nations of the world have forgotten the situation of seeking help from the weak in times of emergency, and are eager to restore the authority they had before the European War. Not only have the promises to help the weak remained empty words, but also, due to economic relations, they regard the colonies of the weak as a source of wealth, and are even more unwilling to make any concessions. The weak in the colonies, having both awakened in their hearts and become resentful within, have reached a point where they are rising up everywhere and at all times to think of settling the score with the strong. Although the methods and means they use are different, the fact that they are rising up and struggling is a phenomenon that exists in every colony in the world.</p>

<p>Yan Xishan</p>
<h3>Advocates Delaying the Formation of a Government</h3>
<h3>Wang Faqin Insists on Party Rule</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person said that Yan insists on delaying the formation of a government because: (1) Most of those who advocate organizing it are not very talented or capable. If they are recruited, it will obstruct the path of the virtuous; if they are not recruited, they will cause trouble. (2) Each province in the north has a person responsible for politics, so organizing it is not relevant to politics. (3) Yan believes in waiting for the fruit to ripen and the water to flow, and there is no need to be anxious. Moreover, the party's disputes have not been resolved. If a government is formed carelessly, how can one answer the critics? Therefore, it will not be realized in the near future. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative, Hu Jiesan, went to Zheng to meet Feng because his efforts to urge the formation of a government were ineffective, and now he and Men Bingyue have gone to Zheng to meet Feng. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Faqin announced that the focus of the party is still on the unresolved word "rule." Wang has never said that he is willing to break the party rule. As for the draft declaration, my brothers and I have not yet expressed our opinions, but it has already appeared in the newspapers, which is very surprising. I do not know who disclosed it. Wang also told people that if anyone wants to engage in political activities, we do not object, but please do not do so in Wang's name. Our proposal will be rejected if it is not adopted. I will retire to the countryside and let those who advocate breaking party rule do as they please. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, Sun Dianying and Fan Zhongxiu's representatives invited Chen Gongbo and others from the Party Committee to thank them. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tan Zhen said that since Wang's Eastern Telegram advocated opening an expanded conference, I hope that the powerful figures Yan and Feng will also send out responsive telegrams so that the party affairs meeting may return to the path of consultation. Today I will visit Zou and Xie to discuss how to proceed. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, Fan Zhongxiu sent another representative, Liu Juemin, to Beiping. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, the delegation and the Western Hills faction said to Wang's telegram that the theory was not leading, and they asked Wang to come to the north to preside over it, otherwise, correspondence would be more tortuous. Today, I will send a telegram to Wang and ask him to prepare for the 3rd Representative Assembly and the National Assembly. At present, national transportation is blocked, and the environment is different. Whether the representatives can come is self-evident. If designated, it would be inappropriate, and the formation of a government is even more distant. Please the comrade Wang who is in charge of party affairs, set an example and come to Beiping first to discuss together, so as to be a call. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Central Political Council Foreign Affairs Group</p>
<h3>Discussing Policy Towards Russia</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Sino-Russian official meeting is about to be held, the Foreign Affairs Group of the Central Political Council decided that the policy towards Russia should be decided first, so that there is something to follow during the meeting. After the Central Political Council meeting on the morning of the 4th, members of the Foreign Affairs Group held a special meeting at the Central Party Headquarters. Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Wang Chonghui, Ye Chucang, Wang Zhengting, etc. attended. The two vice ministers of the Foreign Ministry, Li and Wang, also went to attend and reported on the telegram from Mo Dehui and the current attitude of Soviet Russia. The committees then studied it in detail, and as a result, a method was formulated, which was reported to the Central Political Council. It is heard that the Central Political Council will decide to convene a temporary meeting on the 5th. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to news from foreign affairs circles, the Foreign Ministry has not received a report from Representative Mo regarding the three demands made by Soviet Russia that were reported in the newspapers. This news is unilateral propaganda from Soviet Russia and is not credible. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Disaster in the Northwest is Extremely Severe</h3>

<p>Zhang Xueliang Telegraphed</p>
<h3>His Views on Mongolian Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the National Government on the 30th, stating that he heard that the Mongolian-Tibetan Conference proposed reforming the banner system, changing those without leagues into leagues, and those without banners into banners. In addition, they would organize an Inner Mongolia Administrative Representative Council on each League, and the administration would be handled by the Mongolians themselves, and the courts would be specially established separately, and the counties and banners would not be allowed to manage them. After investigation, this proposal is very reasonable, but most Mongolians have not yet been civilized, and a small number of people advocate this, and most Mongolians will be frightened. If this is implemented at this time, it will cause more obstacles. It is better to wait until the time is ripe before implementing it. Moreover, counties have long been established in the territory of the Mongolian banners in the northeast, and Mongolians and Han Chinese live together in one place. Although the people are different, the land cannot be divided. If the proposal is implemented, it is like setting up two governments in the same region. Not only will there be more abuses, but also a major change may be brewing. Moreover, the princes and dukes of the leagues still have their latent power. Mongolians are accustomed to following the old ways and only follow the orders of the princes and dukes. Once reformed, they will all be suspicious and take risks. It is difficult to avoid becoming a tool for Outer Mongolia. This matter concerns the safety and security of the whole situation, and is of great importance. It is related to the governance of the northeast. I have telegraphed urgently to request that the matter be rectified and that a reply be given. The National Government has ordered the Executive Yuan to forward it to the Mongolian Conference. (4th, Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Foreign news: Semenov united with the Buryats and the middle and small farmers of the East Sea Coast, claiming to have 150,000 people. Small farmers refer to those who cultivate their own fields, while middle farmers are small landowners. In addition to cultivating their own land, they have surplus produce. According to Soviet law, they are not allowed to have fixed land property and are required to rotate the land of the same area every year in order to provide relief. This has been implemented for ten years. This year, the Soviet Union suddenly abolished this small farmer and small economic system and made the land owned by the middle and small farmers, and those who cultivated it all became public fields. As a result, the sovereign took resistance. Semenov received a certain background and was active. Many White Russians from Tianjin and Beiping went to Dalian to join Semenov. Most of these White Russians were former government officials and officials who had served three years ago who were unwilling to be idle, so they united against the Moscow government.

<p>Detainees Angrily Rushed Out, 25 Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Muslims Passed Resolution</p>
<p>Supporting Gandhi's Propaganda</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 3rd - A serious incident occurred near the Weili Detention Center in the Bombay Yarn Factory area on the 2nd. The detention center held about 1,000 volunteers who had been arrested for raiding salt fields. This morning, the detainees paraded, hung black flags, wore black armbands, and shouted slogans against imperialism, opposing the celebration of the British Emperor's birthday. Indians who heard this came to watch, so crowds gathered near the detention center. The police specially invited some engineers to build barbed wire barriers around the detention center, but the women in the yarn factory tried their best to prevent the engineers from working, so they used force to disperse the women. The detainees were therefore very angry and rushed out of the detention center to demolish the barriers. The police stopped them, and a melee broke out, seriously injuring 25 detainees, and 38 people outside the detention center were also injured. The leader of the engineers was hit in the head by a stone. Currently, two platoons of troops and 140 armed police officers are stationed in the detention center area.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Declares in the House of Commons</p>
<h3>Cabinet Will Have Changes</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - British Prime Minister MacDonald said in the House of Commons today that there will be some changes in the cabinet. Because the Imperial Conference is about to begin, the nature of the conference requires the Colonial Office to be divided into two departments. Overseas autonomous territories and dependencies should each be a department, each with a minister. The Labor government has always believed that the economic relationship between overseas autonomous territories and Britain is very important and has exchanged views with overseas autonomous territories and is thoroughly studying this entire issue. He is very willing to allow the Lord Privy Seal, Thomas, to continue the contact that has already been established with the prime ministers of overseas autonomous territories in order to benefit both the empire and British unemployment policies. Therefore, he has decided to ask Thomas to serve as the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. Thomas has agreed. As for how the agency that handles unemployment affairs will be reorganized, he will announce it later. The current Secretary of State for the Colonies, who is also the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, is Sir Passfield.</p>
<p>National Society, London, 3rd - British Prime Minister MacDonald reported to the House of Commons that Thomas has resigned as Lord Privy Seal and has been reassigned as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. Afterwards, the colonies and dominions will be divided into two departments with different responsibilities. He also declared that the government is currently planning other methods to deal with unemployment problems, but Conservative Party members responded with jeers.</p>
<p>British House of Lords</p>
<h3>Discusses Air Routes</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd - The House of Lords discussed the issue of imperial air routes today. The Secretary of State for Air stated that there are currently about 22,350 miles of scheduled air routes within the British Empire, second only to the United States. He hopes that by the end of 1931, the Indian air route can be extended to Australia. However, the date when this route can be opened depends on the Australian government. The Cairo-to-Cape Town line can be opened to the Great Lakes in Central Africa by 1930, and can reach Cape Town directly by the spring of 1931. The report of the advisory committee is very sympathetic to the plan for the Western Atlantic air route. He expects that there will be some achievements in this area, and the Canadian government is very willing to cooperate. If the flights of the airship R-100 to Canada in June and the airship R-101 to India in September are both successful, then the construction of airships with a capacity of 7.5 million cubic feet will begin immediately, because this type of giant ship is only commercially viable. At that time, the cooperation of major shipping companies may be requested. The United Kingdom has spent 2.3 million pounds on the airship program to date and has gained a great deal of knowledge. This knowledge alone is enough to compensate for the loss of money.</p>

<h3>Tax Reduction Plan of Japanese Government Party</h3>
<p>Seiyukai Believes it is Clumsy Propaganda</p>
<p>Minseito Dissatisfied with Hamaguchi's Attitude</p>
<p>Denyusha, Tokyo, 4th - The Seiyukai Executive Committee held a meeting yesterday at the Seiyukai headquarters. At the meeting, the general affairs criticized the tax reduction plan of the government and the party, saying that the naval expenditure for the established expenditure for the Showa 5th and 6th years must be 165 million yen. Afterwards, there will be subsidies for the construction of warships and the replacement construction of submarines every year, which must also cost more than 70 million yen. Furthermore, in order to eliminate the defense anxiety caused by the London Treaty, the air force must be expanded, which will also cost a lot of money. It is bound to use the surplus funds from military reduction. It can be seen that the government's statement that the result of military reduction is used for tax reduction is completely false. It is a clumsy propaganda of the government and the party to deceive the people.</p>
<p>Denyusha, Tokyo, 4th - Three people, including Minseito general affairs Sakurauchi Yukio, visited Prime Minister Hamaguchi yesterday as representatives of the party and requested that the surplus funds from the national treasury resulting from military reduction be used as a source of tax reduction to implement the policy of the Minseito. Prime Minister Hamaguchi replied that the surplus funds from military reduction cannot be used for purposes other than the necessary naval-related expenditures. The young and middle-aged members of the Minseito were dissatisfied with the Prime Minister's statement that the policy of using the surplus funds puts naval expenditure first and tax reduction second, forgetting the meaning of military reduction, which is to reduce the burden on the people. They were all dissatisfied with the Prime Minister's attitude of exclusively relying on the Navy's breath.</p>

<h3>The Battle Situation on the Pinghan Railway</h3>
<p>The Central Army's Right Wing Attacks Qixian</p>
<p>The Central Route Army Passes Linying and Encircles Xuchang</p>
<p>Yancheng Correspondence, June 1st. The Central Army on the Pinghan Railway is achieving successive victories. Apart from the somewhat subdued news from the left wing, the two divisions on the right wing are bravely advancing, bypassing Zhoujiakou from Queshan and Yancheng in a matter of ten days, heading north, passing Xihua, Taikang, and Suixian, and approaching Qixian. This area is defended by the forces of Sun Liangcheng and Ji Hongchang, who are confronting the Central Army at Wuji, ten miles from the city. A fierce battle has been raging since May 24th for eight days and nights, eventually leading to the Central Army's occupation. They are now attacking Qixian to link up with the Central Army on the Longhai Railway and directly seize Lanfeng. The central route has already passed Linying and is besieging Xuchang, which is expected to fall soon. When Linying was captured, the residents of the city, resentful of the harsh levies imposed by Fan Zhongxiu's troops for a long time, actively bound up and handed over any remaining Fan soldiers who had not managed to escape the city to be dealt with when the Central Army entered the city. On the evening of May 31st, Feng's troops were tightening the siege on Xuchang while also dispatching a small number of troops to harass the left wing to divide their forces. The sound of cannons roared loudly all night long. They were repelled by Xu Yuanquan's troops, and it is reported that Feng's troops suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Expeditionary Force Arrives at the Hunan Border</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. The Zhang Gui troops' abandonment of Guangxi and entry into Hunan have recently led to their arrival between Hengyang and Yongzhou. According to news from the front on the 26th, these Zhang Gui troops are still hovering around Hengyang, and whether they will take a detour through Hengshan to attack Zhuzhou and Liling remains to be seen. Therefore, the Guangdong pursuing troops are swiftly intensifying their departure. The authorities have ordered the completion of the transportation of the northbound troops by the end of May, gradually concentrating them on the Hunan border to await orders. It is reported that the Third Independent Brigade of the Sixth Route Army, commanded by Xu Kexiang, has also been ordered to return to the province from Wuzhou, taking the North River route to Hunan. Jiang Guangnai is leading two divisions of elite troops into Hunan, and preparations of all kinds are being made very thoroughly. In addition to the expeditionary force's expenses already being disbursed by the Finance Department, the headquarters yesterday also established supply stations and branch supervisory offices in Shaozhou, Lechang, and other places to facilitate the transportation of military supplies, and added a North River military long-distance telephone line, which was first established from Guangzhou through Shaoguan and Lechang to Chenzhou. Furthermore, two new teams of military communications units have recently been formed, and ten military telegraph operators have been selected and appointed from the Guangzhou Telegraph Bureau to be divided into two groups to accompany the Jiang and Cai divisions into Hunan. In addition, the air force is also a major force in pursuing the enemy into Hunan. On the 26th, Deng Yueming, the captain of the Second Air Squadron of the Aviation Department, led planes and flew to the Hengyang area to scout out the enemy's whereabouts, and will join the army in encircling and attacking the enemy when the army reaches the enemy's defense line. Jiang Guangnai, the commander-in-chief of the forward forces, led personnel from the 61st Division into Hunan from Shaozhou on the 27th to arrive at the Hunan border before the 31st, and will order a push south into Hunan as soon as all the divisions have arrived in Chenzhou. The direction of the advance will depend on the whereabouts of the Zhang Gui troops. (May 30th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Decline of Qingdao's Fishing Industry</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence. The coastal area of Shandong has always been known as the richest fishing area, and the Jiaozhou Bay area is particularly prominent due to its shallow inland waters and numerous beaches. However, in recent years, fishermen have continued to use old methods and have not sought to improve them, and the authorities have not promoted or supported them, allowing the industry to decline, causing a great fishing area to fall into decline. Japanese fishermen have seized the opportunity to invade our territorial waters and seize our fishing rights, which is truly regrettable. The investigation of the fishing industry situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation of Coastal Fishing Grounds: (1) Dengyao Port is located south of Dengyao Village in the Shazikou District, about seventy miles from Qingdao. Fishing was very prosperous here in the spring and winter seasons in the past. Fishermen from Qingshan and Huangshan in Jimo also used this place as a sales market. Now, there are very few fishermen fishing there, and it is no longer worthy of being called a fishing port. (2) Shazikou is located east of Qingdao, about sixty miles away, and is the most prosperous fishing port in the entire district. The port can be divided into three areas: Shazikou, Haimiao Bay, and Quanziya (i.e., Jianggezhuang Bay). This port is the center for offshore fishing, and the amount of fish produced is the highest in the entire district. (3) Shilaoren Bay is located west of Shazikou, about forty miles from Qingdao. The bay is mostly rocky and not very deep. Only in the spring are hairtail caught here. (4) Shandongtou Bay is located west of Shilaoren, about thirty-five miles from Qingdao. The most cuttlefish are caught in this bay during the spring season. During the remaining period, miscellaneous fish are caught by fishing. (5) Xiaogang (also known as Qingdao Port) is located southeast of the Taitung District, about thirty miles from Qingdao. The most hairtail and mullet are produced during the spring season. (6) Sifang Lake Island and other places used to have a fishing ground, but it has now disappeared due to the influence of factories. (7) Shalingzhuang Houwan is located north of Shalingzhuang in the Sifang District, about thirty-five miles from Qingdao. There were still fishermen fishing here twenty years ago, but now the fishing ground has disappeared due to the influence of factories. (8) Cangkou Bay is located north of Qingdao, about thirty miles from Qingdao. Thirty years ago, it was still a fishing ground, but today fishermen mostly go to outside ports. However, there are still many merchant ships coming here in the autumn to load fruits. (9) Nvgushan Bay is located north of Cangkou, about forty-five miles from Qingdao. The most clams, cockles, etc. are produced there. It used to be a prosperous fishing area in Jiaozhou Bay, but the industry has declined in recent years. Only in the spring are there still fishermen catching hairtail, while there are very few fishermen fishing in the autumn and winter. (10) Yinfu is located on the west coast of Jiaozhou Bay, about ten nautical miles from Qingdao. The island is surrounded by the sea on three sides, and people's livelihoods depend on fishing for about 70% of their income, in addition to agriculture accounting for 30-40%. The fishing season is entirely in the spring, and the whole year depends on this income. (11) Xuejiaqi, Huangdao, and Shuilingshan are in the same situation as Yin Island. (12) Zhucha Island is located southwest of Qingdao, about twenty nautical miles from Qingdao. The terrain is surrounded by the sea on all sides, and fishing is most prosperous in the spring season. The abundance of fish produced is no less than that of Shazikou.</p>
<p>Comparison of the Fishing Industry Then and Now: According to investigations, thirty years ago, there were more than 160 villages in the Qingdao area that were fishing villages, with about 20 villages in the Shazikou District, about 8-9 villages in the southern part of the Zhangcun District, about 20 villages in the Taitung District, about 30 villages in the Sifang District, about 10 villages in the western part of the Xianjiazhai District, and more than 70 villages in the entire Haixi area. Fishing households accounted for about half of the total number of households in each village. At present, apart from the Haixi area, which still relies on fishing as a secondary occupation, there are only about 30 households in the Shazikou District on the Haidong side, and very few people engaged in fishing in other areas. Compared to thirty years ago, the ratio is equal to one hundred to ten. According to investigations, the reasons for the decline of the fishing industry are nothing more than the following: 1. After Qingdao was opened as a commercial port, the standard of living increased daily, but the income from fishing could not be increased, resulting in many people abandoning the industry. 2. Fishermen adhered to old methods and did not know how to improve fishing gear and fishing methods. 3. Experiencing economic difficulties. 4. Pirates abounded. 5. The tax levies and donations were too heavy. 6. The government did not provide promotion or support, and the people were unable to improve. 7. Since the Third Year of the Republic, Japanese often intruded into our country's territorial waters to fish, resulting in reduced income for fishermen. Due to these various reasons, the fishing industry in Qingdao gradually declined and fell into a slump. (May 31st)</p>
<p>Jilin Province's Jingbo Lake</p>
<h3>Organizational Plan for the Hydroelectric Power Company</h3>
<p>First build a paper mill and sawmill, then gradually expand to</p>
<p>Make the Northeast an industrial zone that is completely electrified</p>
<p>Jilin Correspondence. Qian Zhaoxi, the former Military Governor of Rehe, and his associates initiated the organization of the Jingbo Lake Hydropower Company in September of last year, and the provincial government approved its establishment. Qian, together with electrical, civil engineering, and geological specialists, went to the site for a field survey on March 1st of this year, and the work has already been completed. It was decided to first trial-operate a paper mill and sawmill, organizing a limited company in accordance with the Company Law, with a total capital of 6 million national currency, divided into 300,000 shares. The head office will be located in Jilin, and branch offices may be established in Liaoning, Heilongjiang, and Rehe provinces as necessary. Once the capital is sufficient, operations will be expanded, with the aim of making the four northeastern provinces an industrial area that is completely electrified. The plan is quite ambitious, and many important figures in Jilin Province have also lent their names in support. An office has been set up in the provincial capital to prepare, and the company's articles of association, along with the investigation report, have been submitted to the provincial government for approval and filing, and the Construction and Agriculture &amp; Mining Departments have been ordered to review any areas of the electrical business establishment and company articles of association that need to be supplemented or revised. Once the orders are followed, work can begin. This matter is extremely important for the development of the Northeast, so the investigation report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Location and Terrain: Jingbo Lake is located in Tiren Township, Ning'an County, Jilin Province, 110 miles southwest of the county seat, at 129 degrees east longitude and 44 degrees north latitude. It is surrounded by mountains, and the accumulated water forms a lake. The lake to the south is called Nantou Lake, and the lake to the north is called Beitou Lake. The two lakes together resemble an "S" shape. The lake surface is 80 miles long from north to south and 20 miles wide from east to west, varying between five and ten miles. The bottom of the lake is mountainous, with uneven elevations. The water depth ranges from 18 zhang to 8-9 zhang, with the water level being deeper in summer compared to spring by 1.3-1.4 chi. The lakeshore is covered with volcanic mountains and protruding rocks that rise dozens of zhang above the water surface. The source of the lake water is divided into two locations: The first originates from the south in Datoushi River, Songjiang River, Fangshengou River, and Xiaojiaji River; the second originates from the southwest, one from Emuxi County and one from Zhangguangcai Mountain Range and Dunhua South Mountain Range. These are the upper reaches of the Mudanjiang River. The outlet of the lake water is only the Zhangjialiangzi Waterfall at the north head of the lake, which is about 4-5 zhang wide. In winter, when the water dries up, it is only about one zhang wide. Below the waterfall is the Mudanjiang River, which is about 700 li long and flows into the Songhua River in Yilan.</p>
<p>Hydropower of the Waterfall: The Zhangjialiangzi Waterfall is the only channel for the lake water to flow into the Mudanjiang River. In winter, when the water dries up, the waterfall is only about one zhang wide, two zhang high, and one chi thick. In summer, it is more than ten zhang high, seven or eight zhang wide, and four or five chi thick. Below the waterfall is a round pool with a diameter of about thirty or forty zhang, surrounded by rocks that are more than ten zhang high. The locals say that the pool is about three li deep. The south of the waterfall is the lake water, the east is the rocky mountain, and the northwest are connected to the Shi Dianzi, a vast expanse of 200 li long and 20-30 li wide. This kind of place is extremely unsuitable for civil engineering work, and the natural waterfall is too large in summer and too small in winter. Even if reservoirs are built to store water for the winter, the water discharge project in the summer will be difficult. However, it is found that about eight miles east of the waterfall, the distance between the lake and the river is about five li in Sijitong Zhengou, where the lake water is twenty zhang higher than the river water. The mountain separating the lake and the river is about ten zhang high. By excavating a ditch through here to the south of the river, it is possible to obtain 500,000 to 800,000 horsepower according to the calculation of the drop flow and flow velocity. By utilizing this huge amount of hydropower, it is possible to obtain 370,000 to 600,000 kilowatts of electricity to supply the four northeastern provinces, with a surplus of 60-70%. The south side of Sijitong is along the lake shore, and the north side is mostly plains with good soil quality, which is conducive to construction. This kind of place is very suitable for an industrial area.</p>
<p>Resources: The land near Jingbo Lake is fertile, the population is sparse, and the benefits of mining, agriculture, land reclamation, fishing, animal husbandry, and hunting are limitless. Forty to fifty li from the south head of the lake is a huge forest that is vast and boundless, and people call it Fuhai. According to Japanese investigations, it is said that there are indeed 200 million tons of timber. If one million tons are harvested annually, it will take 200 years to continue harvesting without exhausting it. If electricity is used for processing and papermaking, it can not only supply Japan's domestic use, but also conquer the Republic of China, etc. Although the trees near the lake seem lush, they have been heavily harvested due to the convenience of lake water transportation, and there are no large forests. Gold sand is found in abundance in the mountains. I saw it in the lake and at the mouth of Chongchong River. According to the locals, the Lahei Mountain in the lake is rich in all kinds of metal ores. Investigations have revealed that gold mines have been reported in Ning'an County in Changshuigou, Liangshuiquanzi, Wuhulin, Huangnihe, Xiaoqingshan, Majiatang, and other places, but Wangqing County, Emuxi County, and Dongning County, which are within 200-300 li of the lake, are the richest gold-producing areas. Coal mines in Dongning County include Foyegou, Changdaoshan, Dawuxiaopo, Wuhulin, Bolih River, and Tangzi. Only Wuhulinzi was about to start mining, but it was stopped, and the rest have not been mined. The lake is rich in fish, with carp and crucian carp being the most abundant. However, the crucian carp is the most delicious and was a tribute during the Qing Dynasty. The mountains near the lake produce famous products like ginseng, astragalus, and mushrooms. The animals include tigers, leopards, bears, wolves, deer, sable, otters, foxes, and gray rats. The most important agricultural product is wheat, followed by millet, barley, soybeans, oats, and sorghum. The quality of wheat is good, and people say that the wheat produced in the eastern province is the best locally produced wheat.</p>
<p>Scenery and Climate: Jingbo Lake was called Wuhanhai in the Tang Dynasty and Biersheng Lake in the Qing Dynasty. Its current name is Jingbo Lake. The mountains are clear and the water is beautiful, and the scenery is excellent. In the lake are Da Gu Shan, Xiao Gu Shan, and Lao Guan Shan. Da Gu Shan is more than 700 chi above the water surface, towering in the lake. The confluence of Daoshi Mountain and Yuansai Mountain is recorded in the county chronicles as "Two Dragons Playing with Pearls". There is an ancient temple on it called the Sanqing Temple. Lao Guan Shan stands alone at the south end of the lake and is inhabited by countless waterfowl. The top is covered with white bird droppings, several inches thick, which from a distance almost looks like accumulated snow. There are also two small mountains standing side by side, like a door, named Zhenzhu Men. North of the door is an ancient city. In the first year of the Republic of China, a copper seal was discovered with the characters "Wuhanzhou Jiansanwang Dadudu" (General Military Governor of Wuhanzhou in charge of Three Kings). The east, north, and south sides of the city are steep cliffs bordering the lake, which people cannot climb. Only the southwest has a winding path that can be used to ascend the city. Traveling all over the lake fills people with pleasure. In summer and autumn, the flowers are red, the water is green, the fish are leaping, the birds are flying, the haze floats, and the sunlight covers the lake, like a natural painting. Some people say that the scenery here is the second best in the world. There is a monument under the waterfall with the inscription "China's First Waterfall", which shows the admiration of tourists. The climate is mild and similar to Changchun. The winters are harsh, with temperatures as low as -30 degrees Celsius. The waterfall does not freeze even in the severe winter.</p>
<p>Transportation: Starting from Sijitong at Jingbo Lake, it is 700 li southwest to Jilin Provincial City, 300 li to Dunhua, 360 li southeast to Yanji, 40 li northeast to Dongjingcheng Town, 110 li to Ning'an County, 160 li to Hailin Station on the Chinese Eastern Railway, 826 li northwest along the Chinese Eastern Railway to Harbin, and 530 li northeast to Suifenhe. Although the waterway through the Mudanjiang River is 700 li long and can reach Yilan, the downstream water flow is too rapid, and many large rocks are exposed on the surface, like stars in the sky, which the locals call "Full of Stars". It is extremely dangerous for ships to travel here. Only wooden rafts and small boats transport garlic, wild vegetables, etc. and sell them together with the boats when they reach Yilan, never returning because it is very difficult to go upstream. Taking the Chinese Eastern Railway from Harbin to the east for 666 li to Hailin Station, there is a long-distance bus to Ning'an County, 50 li, which can be reached in about an hour. Traveling another 70 li south to Dongjingcheng can also be reached by bus in about three hours in winter. It is necessary to take a four-wheeled cart from Dongjingcheng to Sijitong, 40 li. Travel in the summer is slightly difficult. Miscellaneous records state that the farmers living near Jingbo Lake often saw Russians coming here to investigate before the first year of the Republic of China. After the first year of the Republic of China, people from England, France, and the United States also came to ask questions. However, the Japanese have been coming since the seventh year of the Republic of China until the tenth year. During these four years, four people lived here to survey every spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Each season, a shift was replaced, and they continued to come and go. They did not come in the eleventh year of the Republic of China. They investigated every aspect of the soil quality, water volume, topography, and climate in great detail. The domestic people have not seen a single person come here to investigate. Now, seeing them, I am very happy and follow them around all day, guiding them to where the watermarks were set up, where the ice was dug to measure the water, and where the soil was dug and taken away, as if counting family treasures, and speaking without reservation. Some patriotic comrades in the academic community have notebooks with records that they give as gifts, and their enthusiasm and support are moving, further strengthening our original aspirations.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government's Relief for the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>All new electric looms are exempt from taxes.</p>
<p>Zhejiang is China's southeastern sericulture region, and silk and satin have always been its major products. However, since recent years, the industry has declined indescribably. The biggest reason is that the designs are outdated and there is no innovation, and most of the weaving is done by wooden looms, resulting in products that are dull and lackluster, unable to compete with foreign goods. Zhang, the chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, decided to promote and relieve the silk industry, and decided that if people can use the latest European and American electric weaving machines to set up factories, they can be exempt from taxes after submitting an application to the Department of Construction and being approved by personnel sent for inspection. A proposal has been drawn up and submitted to the 311th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for resolution and approval. The Provincial Government has now instructed the Department of Construction to forward the order to the counties, instructing their subordinate silk industries to be informed.</p>
<h3>The Passage of the Tongshen Steamer Back to Harbin</h3>
<p>The ship stayed in Hulin for more than a year due to avoiding the Russian chaos.</p>
<p>The return to Harbin under orders was quite thrilling along the way.</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence. The Tongshen steamer, which had been moored in Hulin to avoid the Russian incident last year, only set sail back on May 18th of this year. The crew experienced many hardships along the way, and the crew returned to their homeland as if after a lifetime. It returned to Harbin Port at 4 pm on the 28th, and docked at the Toutiao Street pier at 9 am on the 29th to unload cargo. After unloading, it berthed on the north bank of the river. It is scheduled to enter the dock for repairs in a day or two and will resume sailing to Hulin on June 14th. According to Zhao Zi'an, the first mate of the ship, the passage of the ship back was as follows:</p>
<p>"Our ship was docked in mid-June of last year when the Russian incident was about to change. I was afraid that it would be dangerous to sail back, and there would be no good outcome, so I docked on our shore in Hulin. Although I could not avoid the alarm of war during the emergency period of the Sino-Russian war, I did not see any facts. In April of this year, I planned to return, and I fired up the engine three times, but I stopped because I was worried about the danger. On May 2nd, the telegraph line between Hulin and Tongjiang was repaired, so I sent a telegram to the headquarters (Navigation Bureau) asking for instructions. On the 5th, I received a reply ordering me to sail back to the port as soon as possible. I telegraphed back that the river channel was dangerous and could not be guaranteed to be free from accidents. Once sailing, the lives and property of the entire ship would have no protection. How should the headquarters handle it? Please give instructions. Then I received a reply saying that the Ussuri and Heilong Rivers are border rivers of the country, and China has its own navigation rights. Now, I am ordered by the National Government to order the ship to return as soon as possible, and all employees will be rewarded generously. The Sino-Russian conference will be held soon, and all other matters need not be considered. After receiving the telegram, I gathered the entire ship's machinists, helmsmen, sailors, etc. and told them the meaning of the telegram. All the employees said that they would only follow the first mate's orders, so I decided to set sail on the 18th. At 6 am, I ordered the engineer to sound the whistle three times according to the ship's regulations and solemnly hung the national flag and the ship emblem. At that time, all the people in Hulin City were alarmed. From the county magistrate to the women and children, many people went to the river to see us off. Most people thought I was nosy, thinking that it was still impossible to set sail. Now that I have set sail, I am blowing the whistle and hanging the flag to alarm the Russian soldiers on the opposite bank. I am afraid that if they do not fire cannons to block the way at this time, it will be difficult to escape the danger. I didn't think so, because I know that I am a Chinese man and woman, I am a Chinese captain, and my ship is sailing in the Sino-Russian border river with justice and righteousness, so what do I have to fear? However, to prevent any accidents, I secretly ordered the engineer to release full horsepower to move forward. When the ship left the Hulin shore, I still saw the crowd shaking their heads and sighing. From Hulin to Tongjiang, we passed through four Russian checkpoints, namely (1) Kayilin, (2) Qiaobozi, (3) Wangbabozi, and (4) Haiqing Fishing Ground. All of the above four checkpoints were heavily guarded by Russian troops. The main stream of the river had been cut down by our side during the anti-Russian campaign last year, so we had to sail close to the Russian bank. Although I knew it was dangerous, there was no other way. At 8 am, the first checkpoint, which was 20 li from Hulin, was on the opposite bank of our land. The office of the Northeast Navigation Bureau was originally located here. The director of the office, Mr. Tang, heard that our ship was sailing, so he hired a special person to watch the river bank to see the Russian side's movements, intending to warn us in case of an accident. Our ship was less than a li away from our shore, and the army went to the river bank in surprise to see the ship sailing, as if they were very surprised, but our ship took the opportunity to accelerate and the fate of the entire ship was entrusted to the engine and the waves. At about 9 am, we passed the second checkpoint, Qiaobozi. The chief pilot Yao Xing (i.e., the chief helmsman) pointed to the black shadow of the mountain in front of us and told us to pay attention. I looked at it with binoculars and saw that the mountains were covered with Russian cavalry soldiers aiming their guns at our ship. I thought that I would not be lucky, so I ordered all the employees on the ship to lie down on the deck, and the helm house was also blocked with armor. This kind of armor was prepared by me in Hulin to prevent accidents on the way. At this time, I took the opportunity to use it. I stood alone in the helm house to direct the engineer to release full horsepower to sail. The ship was sailing at a very high speed, almost unknown how many li per hour. As soon as we passed the side of the mountain, the Russian cavalry rushed down from the mountain and scattered to the riverside. Our ship had already sailed out two li at an extremely fast speed. Looking back at the Russian soldiers, they seemed quite disappointed, shouldered their guns, tightened their reins, and turned their horses away. At about 11 am, we passed the third checkpoint, "Wang Yiba Zi". Looking from afar, the Russian soldiers were in and out of the Russian camp, seeming very confused and pointing at our ship and talking to each other. Our ship crossed before they could decide, and stopped at Tuanshanzi, which belongs to Hulin, that night. The distance was 200 li from Hulin. On the morning of the 19th, we set off again. There were no obstacles along the way. We arrived safely in Raohe in the afternoon and anchored for the night. I got off the ship and told the people from all walks of life in Hulin via long-distance telephone. The other side was very happy for us. On the morning of the 20th, we set off again. The chief pilot Yao Xing suddenly fell ill, probably due to months of worry and hard work, but he still tried his best to support and serve. At 4 pm, we passed the Haiqing Fishing Ground, which was originally our land, but the Russians stationed heavy troops on the opposite bank and called it the fourth checkpoint. Before the Sino-Russian war, our ships often suffered attacks when sailing through this place, and merchants regarded it as a place of fear. We did not dare to celebrate after passing three checkpoints, so we finally determined our fate after passing this place. The ship was sailing closer when we suddenly saw dozens of Russian soldiers rushing out of the barracks and aiming their guns at our ship. I quickly assisted the chief pilot in drumming the wheel to drive the ship. The area is the intersection of the Ussuri and Heilong Rivers, connecting the Ussuri and Heilong Rivers with a river branch called Tongjiangzi, which is hundreds of li long. The harbor fork is winding and not easy to travel. Our merchant ships must pass through this fork when traveling to the Ussuri River. If we sail into this river, it will not be visible to the Russian checkpoint. Therefore, our ship tried its best to turn the rudder and rushed into Tongjiangzi. The Russian soldiers lost their target and stopped shooting. Just as my soul was about to settle down, I encountered an accident. Our ship was moving forward in the bushes when I saw black smoke rising in the air, gathering in the air, as if there were ships sailing ahead. Russian ships, except for warships, do not use coal. In other words, it can be proved by the black smoke that the ship in front was undoubtedly a Russian warship. However, our ship was like an arrow on the string and had to be fired, so we still tried our best to sail forward. It was not until a dozen or so li away that we knew that the black smoke was gathering at the intersection of the Heilong and Ussuri Rivers, which was still far away from our route. Therefore, the hearts of the crew were relieved. On the evening of the 21st, it was raining heavily and the river surface was dark and invisible. I was in charge of the ship and moved forward in the dark. There was no pier to dock at, so I had to desperately sail forward. The rain became heavier and heavier at midnight. In order to protect the lives of the entire ship, I was standing on the upper deck, looking ahead, when I suddenly saw two points of light about a li ahead of our ship moving very fast. Our ship tried its best to chase after them. At 1 am on the 22nd, we had already caught up, because the two points of light had stopped moving in the middle of the river. Our ship sailed past, and we almost fainted in shock, because the two points of light were none other than the mast lights of two huge Russian warships. Their soldiers came out to inspect as our ship passed, and fortunately they did not raise their anchors. Our ship sailed out dozens of li, and because it was dark, we could not move forward, so we stopped the ship in the river. We set sail again at 3 am on the 22nd and arrived at Chendeli at 9 am. I went ashore and asked the Tongjiang Navigation Bureau by telephone whether there were any Russian ships outside the river mouth. According to them, three ships had been berthed a few days ago, but they had already left, and the mines had been cleared, so it was safe to sail. At 8 pm that afternoon, we passed the Russian shore of Xuergu. At 7 pm, we arrived at the Sanjiang Estuary, and at 7:30 pm, we returned to Tongjiang. At that time, the Suzhou ship was firing up the engine, waiting to see how our ship would test the waters before deciding on a plan. After our ship arrived, the Suzhou ship sailed to Heihe at 7 am on the 23rd. In short, I was so frightened along the way back from Hulin that I had never experienced it in my 20 years of life on the river. Fortunately, we sailed back safely and reported to the public and private sectors without any blame." (30th)</p>

They had one son and two daughters. Jin's mother's family was considered relatively well-off. After her father passed away, she often asked her mother for money for her husband to squander. Recently, it was discovered that his wife had received a savings of five hundred yuan, so he repeatedly threatened her to demand money. Because of his recklessness, Jin kindly advised him, but he was always beaten. Jin was a weak woman deeply influenced by old etiquette, so she swallowed her tears and washed her face with tears. Because he was unable to get what he wanted, Huang used extremely cruel methods to tie up Jin in the front room and beat her to death with a door bolt and other objects. By the next day, neighbors did not see Jin and became suspicious. They pushed straight in and saw Jin's body lying across the room, covered in bruises. Her mother, who was over sixty years old, rushed to the scene after hearing the news and was heartbroken.

Guo Enbo did not dare to speak out and left dejectedly.</p>
<p>Panic Over the Future of People's Food Supply: Since the beginning of spring in Wuxi, the price of rice has gradually risen and cannot be curbed. Although the government has advised rice merchants to consider the people's food supply, limit rice prices, and prohibit exports, the speakers are earnest and the listeners are indifferent. Now that summer has arrived, rice merchants are again using the pretext that the supply is scarce due to the transition period and gradually raising the price of rice. As of yesterday, the market price of white rice had risen to 17.2 yuan per dan and is likely to continue to rise. The common people who depend on grain are greatly alarmed.</p>
<p>Daytime Robbery Case in Jihuayuan Lane: Li Yonglian, also known as Ronglin, a teacher at the Zhenyi Silk Factory outside the South Gate, is responsible for teaching the children of the factory workers and lives in the factory's Jihuayuan Lane workshop. Around 2:00 pm the day before yesterday, four robbers wearing white short shirts and pants and undershirts, carrying knives and iron rulers, arrived at Li's house one after another. One person stayed outside to keep watch, and the other three entered to rob. First, they tied up Li's sister, Ye Li, with a rope and rubbed her lips with a knife, shouting, "If you make a sound, I'll cut you!" Ye was too frightened to make a sound. Li's wife and daughter happened to be at the factory, so the robbers went upstairs and directly entered Yonglian's room to search. After about forty minutes, they took the loot and left with the lookout, passing the small wooden bridge and heading towards Baoshan Temple. Afterwards, Ye shouted loudly and told the neighbors. Yonglian checked the lost items, which included fifty yuan in silver dollars, one hundred and fifty yuan in banknotes, gold hairpins, gold bracelets, and single-layer clothing, bedding, etc., worth more than three hundred yuan in total. He immediately reported the incident to the Public Security Sub-Bureau of the camp, which forwarded it to the authorities for investigation. In the evening, Luo Xiaoda, a member of the Third Sub-Bureau, arrested a suspect named Li Huzi in front of Baoshan Temple, but he was found to be unrelated and was released on bail.</p>
<p>Summary of Rural Robbery Cases: Xu Yongkang, who lives in the vicinity of Dongfeng, Yangming Township, Third District, has been doing business in Shanghai. There are few people living at home. The night before last, many robbers carrying guns and flashlights broke into the house and searched everywhere for about an hour before taking the loot out. After checking, it was found that a total of more than two hundred yuan was lost. Yesterday, Yongkang sent a letter to the county reporting the incident and requesting investigation. Also, at 1:00 am the night before last, more than ten robbers in Youdu Village, Jingyun City, blatantly knocked on the door of Xu Shougen. Several other robbers were guarding the back door of Xu's house. The back door had been broken. The robbers poured in. Xu Shougen's son hurriedly held a gong and climbed onto the roof, banging loudly to alarm the neighbors, who rushed to the rescue. The robbers then dispersed and fled.</p>
<p>Court Interrogation Record of a False Robbery Report Case: Cao Haochu, the accountant of the Luhangxing Foundry in Tonghui Bridge, received a total of 400 yuan in silver dollars and banknotes from Chen Zufu in Qingyang Town on the 29th of last month. The next day, he took a boat back to Wuxi. Not long after arriving at the port, he went to the Sixth Public Security Sub-Bureau to report that he had been robbed by two robbers near Liangba who opened fire and stole all 400 yuan he had collected. The sub-bureau found many suspicious points in his statement. In addition to investigating the case, it prepared a document and sent him to the County Public Security Bureau, which forwarded him to the County Government. Zhou Zitun, the trial judge, opened the court for interrogation yesterday. According to Cao Haochu's confession, he held the bag of money when the boat arrived at the dock, but the crowd was crowded and he accidentally let go of it. Suddenly, it was stolen. He was extremely anxious at the time and intended to commit suicide by jumping into the river. Then he thought that the stolen money was a mistake, and it was useless to die. However, he was mentally confused and after much thought, he falsely reported a robbery in the hope of concealing the matter. However, his relationship with the factory owner was very good, and he could not bear to cause him losses. Now, he had no choice but to sell his property to repay the debt. He knew that the false report of the robbery was inappropriate and requested leniency. Zhou Jun verified the confession and determined that his statement was factual. He ordered him to provide a guarantor to leave and handle the matter, pending investigation and verification.</p>

<h3>Nantong</h3>

The Press Federation held a special meeting at 7:00 pm to discuss the matter and decided that each newspaper should report as much as possible on the news of the opium trafficking case.</p>
<p>Military and Police Teams Launch Large-Scale Bandit Suppression: Bandits have been harassing the border area between Nantong, Rugao, and Haimen counties in Jiangbei. Recently, the wheat harvest has been completed and obstacles have been removed. The national army, provincial police team, and local security corps stationed in the area have jointly formed a bandit suppression team to launch a large-scale encirclement and suppression of the bandits.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Ambiguous Departure of Sub-Bureau Chief: Peng Ze (Zijie Shi), the chief of the North Wai Public Security First Sub-Bureau, was appointed after the new bureau chief Li Zong took office. Less than a month after his appointment, Mao Mujun, the district chief of the Second District of the Water Public Security Team, came to Cheng from Wuxi on the Jing'an warship on the 3rd and contacted County Magistrate Li. Then, he took Peng Ze to Wuxi. The sub-bureau affairs were handled by Cui Siping, the section chief of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau. It is said that Peng had uncleared matters when he was the captain of the sixth team in the Second District of the Water Police. Mao and Peng decided to take a warship to Wuxi on the morning of the 4th. They were extremely secretive to the outside world, only saying that Peng's father was critically ill in Suzhou and had asked for a few days' leave. The official denied and refused to announce other reasons.</p>
<p>Court Interrogation of Chen Songshan's Dereliction of Duty Case: Chen Songshan, the head of the Deshun Township Security Corps, was accused by Shi Xilin of killing his brother Shi Daguan and moving the body. The case of dereliction of duty was transmitted to a thousand witnesses for interrogation by Judge Yang on the evening of yesterday (the 3rd). Shi Xilin and his mother Yao both testified that after Daguan was detained, he entrusted Wang Dayi, Chen Guanlin, and Cai Rujin to provide a guarantee of eight yuan in bureau fees, but he was still not released. He suddenly hanged himself and died. He also had no illness. Therefore, they suspected whether he was beaten to death or hanged to death, which was difficult to determine. The judge said that he had witnessed the autopsy and confirmed that the deceased had indeed hanged himself. If it was clearly stated that he was beaten to death, he would have to provide a counterclaim guarantee in accordance with the law and submit it to the High Court for review and verification in order to make it clear. Shi Xilin replied that he only suspected that he was beaten to death and it was difficult to guess. The judge then interrogated the guarantors Wang Dayi and others. They testified that they went to guarantee Daguan twice but he was not released. The third time they went to guarantee, Commander Chen agreed but did not release him, and they did not know about the rest of the matter. Chen Songshan testified that if he had beaten Shi Daguan to death, he would be willing to be shot and requested a review. After the interrogation, Chen Songshan was released on bail pending further investigation and interrogation, and the others were ordered to return. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Body Standing Upright in the River: A male corpse was suddenly found in the small river behind Bu Jiacun, Sixth Bao, Changshou Township, yesterday morning.

On the evening of the 2nd, Zhang Zongsi, an opium trafficker, and his brother suddenly asked Wen for 250 yuan in owed money, saying that it was handled by Lu Juqiu and there was a written record as evidence. Wen then twisted Zhang Zongsi and others to the Public Security Bureau, saying that Zhang and others were in the form of kidnapping. He used to be a public official, but now he has retired. Suddenly, he came to retaliate against the working personnel. Wouldn't it be dangerous? Then, Huang Jinbiao and others persuaded him to leave. Wen Renfu formally filed a lawsuit yesterday.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Government's Method of Hiring: Since the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, no less than two thousand people have been introduced from all parties as county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs. The congestion in the official career is alarming. The provincial government now intends to adopt a selection method. Roughly, each member of the concurrent office will conduct a detailed review first. Those who pass the review will number about seventy people. It is intended to fill out the review qualification form in accordance with the county magistrate's appointment regulations, together with supporting documents, and first hold a general conversation with the introducers, and then have each member talk separately to determine whether they are qualified or not. At the same time, the person introduced by the member and qualified after his review must be fully responsible by the member. As for those who have passed the selection, before being appointed, they will be given considerable work as a test. If the results are excellent, they will be formally appointed. This method is still in the experimental stage. Recently, the provincial government has appointed about twenty county magistrates. The date of their arrival in office varies from one month to two months. Among these twenty people, two have now been accused and the provincial government has sent people to investigate secretly. It is now heard that the central government has approved the county magistrate examination and it can be held in June or July. The selection method may need to be changed in the future.</p>
<p>Villagers in Eastern Town Burn Bandits to Death: In the Guanshan Temple area of Zhenjiang East Town, bandits have been gathering and looting in recent days, and there have been cases of kidnapping and burning. The villagers are anxious and sleepless, hating the bandits to the core. The day before yesterday, hundreds of people gathered and searched for bandits everywhere. They searched and captured one bandit each in Zongzhang Lane, Shiqiao Tou, and Bei Wang Lane, and seven bandits in Hou Li and other places, for a total of ten. After discussion, it was decided to burn the ten bandits together to warn the future and vent their hatred for the harassment.</p>
<p>Results of the National Arts Branch Examination Announced: The Jiangsu Provincial National Arts Branch recruited the second class of normal school students the day before yesterday.

<p>Tobacco Merchants Oppose the Director of the Tax Collection Office: Yangzhou tobacco merchants held a meeting at the Guangye Public Office on the 3rd to discuss dealing with Wu Chida, the Director of the Tobacco License Tax Collection Office, and decided on (1) not to resist taxes, (2) not to recognize Wu personally, and (3) not to stop until Wu is removed. It is heard that the reason is that Wu, who also serves as the head of the Public Security Bureau's registration of female singers, has abused his power to falsely accuse Dong and two unrelated merchants of resisting taxes and has asked the Public Security Bureau to arrest them. It is now heard that Wu will continue to serve, so they are trying to resist.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>River Works Completed, Boat Traffic Resumes as Normal: Since the opening of the Tongde Line from Puyuan Town to Chang'an Station on the Huhangyong Line, travel has been convenient. The towns of Shimen and Tongxiang that it passes through are also major towns in Hezhong. Last autumn, boat traffic was suspended due to the dam break in the canal for dredging, causing hardship for passengers. Now that the river works have been completed, boat traffic has resumed as normal since the 20th of last month, which is convenient at a time when silkworm cocoons are on the market.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Xu Jinian Escapes from Two Kidnapping Attempts: Xu Jinian (also known as Si Bao Xiang) of Da Sizha west of Xucang Bridge in Huzhou has a considerable fortune and has long been coveted by bandits. Because Xu is good at defending himself, wears tattered clothes, and often pretends to be a coolie, the bandits have no way to start. On the 31st of last month, Xu went to Xucang Bridge to shop and was about two miles away from Zha on his way home when he encountered a bandit wearing a yuan yu gauze long gown. The bandit took out a pistol from his sleeve and forbade Xu from making a sound or shouting, asking if he was the Si Bao boss. Xu replied that he was not and that his surname was Yang. Three other bandits twisted Xu to the woods and searched him all over, robbing him of one silver dollar, six small silver coins, more than forty copper coins, three yellow croaker fish, more than a catty of pork, and several packets of tea snacks. Xu Jinian escaped home. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the same day, more than ten bandits armed with guns broke through the wall and entered. Xu could not avoid being dragged away by the bandits, who said, "Is your fourth boss at home?" Xu hurriedly said he was at Xucang Bridge. The bandits let go of Xu and searched everywhere upstairs, finding nothing and robbing all the clothes and other items, resulting in a loss of more than 300 yuan. Although Xu encountered bandits twice in one day, he was lucky to escape both times due to his quick wit.</p>
<p>Bandits Threaten Monks: At Hongxi Temple in Jinjia Lane, West Gate of this city, at about 3:00 pm the day before yesterday, a bandit wearing short clothes suddenly arrived. The abbot Liankui happened to be out attending religious services, leaving only a seven-year-old novice monk in the temple. The bandit asked where the abbot was, and the novice monk replied that he had gone out to attend religious services. The bandit left a letter asking to borrow 1,400 yuan and instructed him to tell the abbot Si Bao of the Xin Temple in Dongqiao Village outside the West Gate to borrow 1,600 yuan, which was limited to be paid at Sutai Mountain outside the South Gate on the tenth day of the fifth lunar month.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Water Pump Delivered to Hangzhou: The Hangzhou Waterworks has signed a contract with the Shanghai Xie Feng Construction Factory for the project and is now scheduled to start construction on the 29th.

<p>Qingyun Street Robbery Case Solved: The case of robbery and murder of the woman Yang Fang in the Hengda cigarette shop at the intersection of Qingyun Street, Guanchao, Xiachegn, Hangzhou, has now been solved. It is heard that the provincial capital's detective team has now captured many of the robbers involved in the case and is still investigating and interrogating them.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Butcher Shops Strike to Oppose Slaughterhouse: Yesterday, the butcher shops in Ningbo City went on an informal strike to oppose the Second Slaughterhouse. It is heard that the municipal government believes that the representatives of the butcher shops all supported the construction of the slaughterhouse and did not oppose it. Now that it has been completed, it is difficult to strike against it, and their attitude is very firm.</p>
<p>Yingrui Warship Sails to Dinghai to Be Stationed: The Yingrui warship sailed to Dinghai on May 31 to be stationed to protect the fishing season and patrol for pirates.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Preservation of Land Reporting Handling Fees: The Xiaoshan County Government yesterday received an order from Director Zhu of the Civil Affairs Department, stating that although the county's Land Reporting Office had been ordered to close and dissolve completely by the end of April, the second step of the reporting process still needs to continue. All handling fees collected by the county for land reporting, in addition to the four-tenths that should be submitted to the province as previously ordered, the remaining three-tenths retained by the county must be properly preserved for future use and not diverted for other purposes.</p>
<p>Shangnan Township Expedites Disaster Relief: The townships of Shangnan, Xiaoshan, Heshan, Datong, Zixia, etc., suffered repeated disasters last year, with no grain harvested from the fields. Now, during the lean season, the disaster victims are emaciated and pitiful. Local gentry and people have raised 2,000 yuan in cash to purchase 200 dan of cheap rice for distribution, scheduled to begin on June 10th.</p>
<p>Arrangement of Xianghu Yahu Mountain: Since Xianghu Lake in Xiaoshan was developed as a rural normal school and agricultural experiment station, it has achieved considerable success. Now, the graves in the Yahu Mountain area are being ordered to be moved to facilitate the construction of new buildings for farm expansion. The scenery of the lake is excellent, and the future arrangement of buildings and construction to enhance the scenery will be no less appealing to visitors than Hangzhou's West Lake.</p>

<h3>### China vs. Japan Men's Volleyball Preliminary Round (Xu Minhui) – China Wins 2-1</h3>
<h3>Unfair Refereeing</h3>
<p>(Hui Jing Tong Xun) The preliminary round of the China-Japan volleyball match began at 3:00 PM on the 26th, with referees Mr. Hara and Mr. Sakamoto.</p>
<p>The Chinese volleyball team's style is very different, so few Japanese spectators attended the match. They were confident of victory without a doubt, but the result was unexpected. Our team's players were also confident of victory, so they were not very attentive. Before long, the Japanese team repeatedly pressed and scored points. The score quickly showed Japan with nine points, while China only had three. This was due to their underestimation of the opponent. At this point, they realized they could not be too careless, so they quickly caught up. However, within two or three rounds, the Japanese team had already scored eleven points, and our team had four. After switching sides, our team held an emergency meeting to discuss strategies for facing the opponent. As soon as they restarted, they regained control of the ball. Li Fushen served, and they quickly scored several points, tying the score at eleven. Then, Zeng Jingquan served and scored three consecutive points, putting them ahead of the Japanese team at fourteen to eleven. However, they stopped advancing. The Japanese team repeatedly used flanking tactics, taking advantage of the gaps in our three lines, scoring five consecutive points and catching up to sixteen to fourteen. Our team then called a time-out to break the momentum of the opponent. As expected, when the game restarted, Zhu Zucheng scored three consecutive points, resulting in a score of seventeen to sixteen in our team's favor. Just then, the Japanese team scored a point while serving at the net, catching up with our team again. Xu Heng then caught up with two points, resulting in a score of nineteen to eighteen. At this point, both teams defended their positions tightly, unable to advance. After several exchanges, the Japanese team scored two consecutive points through our three lines. The Chinese supporting team was extremely anxious, as the Japanese referee was biased and openly stole points, repeatedly claiming that our team's hands crossed the net or touched the net. Our team captain protested several times, but to no avail. The spectators were outraged, urging our team not to continue the match. Only after repeated persuasion from our team leaders did they agree to resume the game. The two teams did not make much progress. There were still one or two violations and penalties. The cheering squad continued to scold vehemently. The game ended with Japan winning by a score of twenty-two to twenty.</p>
<p>The Chinese cheering squad was extremely angry. Some wanted to withdraw, while others wanted to stay and see how it would end. Everyone believed that under such unfair officiating, even the best skills would be useless.</p>
<p>The second game began with Chen Xibing scoring three consecutive points, and Cao Tingzan also scoring one point, taking the lead. The Japanese team was flustered and reinvigorated, attacking with two lines on the right flank several times. Our team's five generals, Zhu, Li, Xu, Li, and Zeng, were all defeated and returned with no points. Fortunately, our team's Qiu Guangxie and Li Lianying also repelled five enemy generals, so the score remained four to one. The Japanese team scored two more points, and after more than ten battles, there was no clear winner. More than ten minutes passed, but the score was only nine to five. In this game, China often took the lead, and the referee's attitude also changed greatly. Our team members were very calm and able to use their strengths to the fullest. The teamwork was also impressive. When Chen Congchao served, the whole team was invigorated. Qiu Guangxie repeatedly smashed the ball several times. Zhu Zucheng and Li Lianying cooperated to lift the ball in front of the net, slightly higher than the net, and then smashed it down like lightning, scoring eight consecutive points. Although the Japanese team also fought back and regained three points, Cao Tingzan scored four consecutive points while serving. The Japanese team was unable to recover at this point, and China finally won with a score of twenty-one to eight.</p>
<p>In the third game, the Japanese team replaced the right wing player, who was good at smashing, for some reason. In the beginning, the Japanese team still mustered their remaining strength, and the two teams were evenly matched. After a long time, they gradually became tired and exhausted, and the army had no fighting spirit. Our team attacked relentlessly. All those who served returned with points. Among them, Cao Tingzan scored the most points. At twenty to six, Zhu and Li were eager to win and end the game quickly, repeatedly trying to use their superb skills, but they were too hasty and lifted the ball too low, failing repeatedly. Fortunately, the score difference was so large that the Japanese team had no hope of counterattacking. China finally won with a score of twenty-one to eight. Although the Japanese team's ball skills were skillful and young, they were not weak. Their saving ability was very fast, and the smashing balls from the two lines on both wings were also very powerful. Unfortunately, their experience was still small and their training was insufficient, so they ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Our team's Qiu Guangxie made great contributions in this battle. The balls he smashed were either far or near. Although the Japanese team wanted to close the door, he took advantage of the gap to enter, or flew over the enemy's fingers. Most of the points were scored by this gentleman. Zhu and Li's cooperative fast smashing was very distinctive, and the enemy had to admire it.</p>

<h3>### China vs. Philippines Football Preliminary Round</h3>
<p>China Wins 5-0</p>
<p>Dai Linjing Scores a Hat-Trick and Makes Great Contributions</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan Bravely Saves the Ball and Achieves Miraculous Results</p>
<p>(Tokyo Communication) On the 27th, at 12:20 PM, the Chinese and Philippine football teams faced off for the first time at the track and field stadium. A crowd of over 50,000 spectators, impressed by the reputation of the two teams, came to watch. The referee was Takechi Torao, with Hamada Satoshi and Asao Yao as linesmen. As a result, China won 3-0 in the first half and 2-0 in the second half. Overall, China won 5-0 against the Philippines. The detailed report of the match is as follows:</p>
<h3>(1) Opening the Score in Eight Minutes</h3>
<p>After the kickoff, both sides fought bravely. Our side was facing headwinds, so the ball often circled in front of our goal, creating a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, the iron gate Zhou Xianyan guarded it like an iron barrel, otherwise it would have been dangerous. In the eighth minute, our team's right inside forward, Chen Jiaqiu, dribbled the ball straight in, breaking through the inner defensive line to the front of the goal. The Philippine army rushed to pounce, Chen then kicked the ball diagonally, lightly passing it to the center forward Dai Linjing. Dai calmly raised his foot and kicked, quickly and forcefully, directly into the goal from the right corner. The Philippine goalkeeper was unable to defend it. China won the first goal.</p>
<h3>(2) Another One in Half an Hour</h3>
<p>After that, the Philippine army tried hard to counterattack, and the momentum was quite strong. It had repeatedly taken corner kicks, but to no avail. The Philippine army's forwards' individual skills were not weak, but their teamwork was too lacking. Every time they had a chance to attack the goal, they kicked the ball out of bounds. One time, our team mobilized all its forces, and the interior was empty. Suddenly, the Philippine army's left wing dribbled the ball straight in. Goalkeeper Zhou Xianyan hurriedly left the goal to rescue. The Philippine army's feet were fast, and it was already ten yards away from the goal. Zhou returned and rushed again, but he could not reach it. He only saw the Philippine army raise its foot and kick the ball, but the ball passed over the crossbar, which can be said to be a missed opportunity. At the thirty-first minute, the Philippines was penalized for a corner kick. Ye Beihua kicked it out and the ball landed right in front of the Philippine goal. The soldiers of both sides were mixed in a pile, and the center forward Dai Linjing headed the ball towards the goal, and it went into the net again. Our team won the second goal.</p>
<h3>(3) Dai Linjing Scores a Hat-Trick</h3>
<p>Only one minute later, Sun Jinshun got the ball and passed it to Ye Beihua, who drove straight towards the goal with the ball, and then passed it to Dai Linjing, whose foot head slightly raised and the ball jumped into the net again. Our team won the third goal. So the cheerleaders sang the song of victory. For days, our country has endured humiliation, and at this time, it was able to vent a little.</p>
<h3>(4) The Fourth One Doesn't Count</h3>
<p>Since the Philippine army lost two goals, it was still not willing to give up. The whole army launched a general attack to try to attack, but because our team's internal strength was very abundant, there was nothing to do. At the thirty-eighth minute, our army's left wing Ye Beihua got the ball and broke through the enemy's second line of defense. A kick in the wind went into the net again, but the referee came over and said that it was offside and did not count. So the first half ended with our team winning by three to zero.</p>
<h3>(5) Ye Beihua Begins to Contribute</h3>
<p>After lemon time, the two sides exchanged ground and fought again. Our team replaced Chen Jiaqiu with Chen Guangyao as the right wing, and the power was even more powerful, but the Philippines was not weak and often rushed into the internal defense line. After a long battle, there was no winner. In the twenty-eighth minute, Ye Beihua single-handedly penetrated the enemy territory. From the left, Ye Beihua single-handedly penetrated the enemy territory. From the left, he scored a goal, making the first contribution. Our team won the fourth goal.</p>
<h3>(6) Sun Jinshun Gets a Goal</h3>
<p>Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue and went all the way, unstoppable. Before a minute had passed, Ye Beihua got the ball and passed it to Sun Jinshun. Sun kicked the ball three times to get close to the goal and kicked the ball into the net from the side corner. Our country won the fifth goal. At this time, our team replaced Ye Beihua with Feng Youyun. The two sides fought fiercely for a long time without any records. As a result, our team won a complete victory with five to zero.</p>
<h3>(7) Li Ning's Iron Head Reigns Supreme</h3>
<p>In today's battle, every one of our country's team members was as lively as a dragon and a tiger. The Japanese spectators were amazed. In the defense, Li Ning's few lying balls and headers saved many dangerous balls, so the Japanese people honored him as Iron Head. Here is a record of the lineups of the two teams:</p>
<h3>(8) Chinese Team</h3>

<h3>China vs. Philippines Second Men's Volleyball Match</h3>
<p>China Wins Big 2-0</p>
<h3>Avenge the Shame of the First Round Defeat</h3>
<p>The second volleyball match between China and the Philippines was held because it was cloudy and rainy, so after the women's exhibition match, the two teams went to the stadium to stretch their muscles and practice slightly. The match was held at 2:45 PM. The referees were Sakamoto and Hirota.</p>
<p>In the first game, the Philippine team served. After two or three smashes, they took a 4-0 lead. Then, the two teams fought each other. Qiu Guangxie's smash was effective. Xu Heng's skillful attack disrupted the enemy's rear. The front row net was also good, and they took a 9-7 lead. However, the tall men in the front row of the Philippine team often lightly jumped and raised their hands to high-pressure balls, which fell vertically and were difficult to save. After switching sides at 11-10, the two teams stole the ball and attacked each other. Their strength was almost equal, and the scores were close. At twenty points, they were tied. Qiu Guangxie's smash was effective, and Li Lianying's spike was effective. As a result, they won with a score of twenty-two to twenty.</p>
<p>In the second game, our team became more and more proud and disturbed the enemy's formation, throwing empty gaps and scoring points with every move. The Philippine army's teamwork was poor, but they also tried hard to cope. After more than ten fierce battles, Qiu Guangxie's quick strike changed the venue at eleven to six. After that, the Philippine team rallied and hit the ball more accurately. Our army's rear guard also lost a lot of ground and chased closely to fifteen to fourteen, almost tying the score. However, the opponent's front row touched the net, and Li Lianying's spike was amazing, increasing the score to eighteen to fourteen. The Philippine team requested time, intending to dampen our sharp edge. In the continued competition, the Philippine team's front row violated the net again. Cao Tingzan and Chen Xibing's smashes gradually made the Philippine team unable to support themselves, and the score was twenty to fifteen. In the last point, both sides desperately attacked and defended. Good skills continued to come out, and there was no compromise back and forth. The battle was extremely fierce, and our team won with a score of twenty-one to fifteen, washing away the shame of the first round defeat and tying the Philippines with one win and one loss.</p>

<h3>### China vs. Japan Baseball Preliminary Round</h3>
<p>China Suffers a Crushing Defeat 3-21</p>
<p>(Tokyo Communication) The preliminary baseball match between China and Japan was held at 2:30 PM on the 26th. Before the war, our army was highly anticipated. Japanese critics and experts did not dare to underestimate the strength of the Honolulu Chinese team, so baseball fans rushed to the stadium to watch. Unexpectedly, the two teams' ball skills were far apart. The Japanese army wreaked havoc, and China was at a loss. The Japanese audience was delighted, but our army's supporters were heartbroken and extremely sad.</p>
<p>In the competition, I only saw the Japanese army active and rampant, attacking fiercely. In the first inning, our team's pitcher, Zhong You, controlled the ball quite well and killed two enemies first. However, due to careless defense, Japan scored two people on base. When the score was two to three, the enemy's strong third base right-side ball rolled far to the left wing and became a home run, scoring three points in one fell swoop. The decline of our team's morale probably started from this. After that, in each inning, Japan became more violent and attacked with all its forces, while our team's defense gradually collapsed and mistakes were made one after another. By the time the enemy scored thirteen points, in the fourth inning, our team recovered two points. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh innings, the Japanese added eight points, and the overall situation was decided. In the sixth inning, Chen Yunfang was transferred to pitcher, but it was difficult to stop the enemy's power. In the eighth inning, Cai Yunping, who took over, could not bear it and took the heavy responsibility of pitcher. Yu Xian was the catcher, and he was able to do nothing. As a result, Japan won a great victory with twenty-one points to three. Alas, China's defeat.</p>

<h3>Japan vs. Philippines Second Men's Volleyball Match</h3>
<p>Philippines Wins Big 2-0</p>
<p>(Tokyo Communication) The second volleyball match between the Philippines and Japan was held on the 27th at 3:55 PM in the rain. The referee was Toyoshima Sakamoto, and the Japanese army served first.</p>
<p>In the first game, Japan lost the right to serve due to touching the net. The Philippine team's front-row pressure attack and slashing tactics scored points with every move. The Japanese army was not weak and chased closely behind. The Philippines switched sides at eleven to eight. Japan switched Wu and Sakagami to join the army, and the military might was quite strong. In an instant, they tied the score at fourteen points. After that, they took a 17-16 lead. However, this effort was only momentary. The Philippine team's slash became sharper and the net was sure. In the end, they won with a score of 21-17.</p>
<p>In the second game, Japan was quite superior at first. The two armies were very busy pressing and attacking, and they dealt with each other for a long time. Moreover, the rain made the game difficult due to the wet ball. After a tie of nine points, the front row center of the Philippine team used their tall stature and long arms to slash and score, switching sides at eleven to nine. After entering, the battle was fierce. It was not easy to score points back and forth. However, the Japanese army made continuous mistakes because they were eager to recover. The Philippine team took advantage of the situation to attack sharply and won a victory with a score of 21 to 12.</p>
<p>The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>### China vs. Philippines Second Baseball Match</h3>
<p>China Wins Big 15-4</p>
<p>(Tokyo Communication) The second baseball match between China and the Philippines was held on the 28th at 2:30 PM. Black clouds covered the stadium. Because it had rained the previous day, it was wet, and the strength of the three baseball countries had already been determined in the preliminary match between China and Japan, so there were very few spectators.</p>
<p>Our team attacked first. In the first inning, Zhang Rong'an saw the ball go out of bounds. The next player had a hit and four balls filled the bases. Cheng Guanbing hit a long shot to the right wing and scored the first point. The Philippine team had three unproductive players. In the second inning, neither side scored. In the third inning, Lu Shujie hit the ball and got on base. With the help of his teammates, he scored another point. In the fourth inning, Zhang Rong'an hit a double to send Feng Enci back to the team for one point. The Philippine team changed pitchers. Feng Yuhe hit the enemy's right wing. The front ball was lost and rolled far to become a triple. Zhang Rong'an scored. The Philippine team also took advantage of our team's mistakes to retaliate with two points. In the sixth inning, when our team was full of bases, the enemy advanced to defend. Feng Yuhe broke through the shortstop and both ran back to the team. Cai Yunping hit a left-field single and sent his teammates back to report a point. At this time, he changed pitchers again. Cheng Guanbing made a high fly sacrifice hit, and Feng Yuhe ran back quickly. He Donghan intercepted Cai Yunping's score in front of the first base line. In this turbulent game, our team scored five points in one fell swoop. In the seventh inning, they continued to attack fiercely and added two points. The overall situation had been decided. The Philippine team worked hard to win two points with two hits. In the ninth inning, in the final battle, the Chinese athletes wreaked havoc and scored more points.

<p>Anecdotes from the Games</p>
<h3>New Record for Athlete Age</h3>
<p>On the first day of the Games, many new records were set, and the most interesting was the new record for athlete age. Some say that Mr. Feng Enci, a Chinese baseball player, is 54 years old, while others say he is 47 years old. He is roughly around 50 years old and has grandchildren. Unexpectedly, things are never so unique. Mrs. Asabuki, a Japanese tennis player, is definitely not young either. She is 42 years old this year, and her son has already entered Keio University. These two are old oddities. There is also one who is surprisingly young, namely the Philippine baseball player S, who is only eleven years old this year. The big bat is bigger than</p>

The Japanese athlete Kimura was also not bad, jumping over one meter and ninety-six centimeters, but at this time, he was a little hesitant and unsure whether to jump again or stop here. He couldn't make up his mind. Later, he failed once and didn't pass twice. In the end, he couldn't get excited for the third time. At that time, the whole field was silent, watching what would happen. Unexpectedly, a group of female students next to him yelled "Mr. Kimura," breaking the air.</p>
<h3>Cheerleading Squad Shines Alone</h3>
<p>In the various competition venues of the outer garden, it can be said that you can't see the small flags of green, white, and red all over the ground here. Among the spectators, there is a pile of red hats in the east and a pile of white hats in the west, all of which are our country's cheerleading squad. There are countless other plainclothes teams. From the moment the athletes enter the venue, they start working, shouting slogans and singing cheering songs. This side says "China," and the other side continues with "Hua," followed by shouting "Long live" in unison. This rises and the other falls, without a moment of rest, making the atmosphere in the whole field tense to the extreme and excited to the extreme. It's really rare to be so energetic.</p>
<h3>Don't Be Sordid, but Be Hilarious</h3>
<p>Before the first China-Japan basketball game started, the athletes from both countries went to the stadium to practice. The Chinese athletes wore white clothes, white pants, and white shoes, plus the red national emblem on their chests, which was extremely bright. The Japanese athletes were all in gray clothes and pants. A Japanese girl next to them said, "They look as sordid as mice." After a while, both sides took off their coats. The Japanese athletes also looked very beautiful in yellow clothes and white pants. A Chinese person said to the little girl, "Don't be sordid." This made everyone laugh heartily, and the little girl couldn't help but smile.</p>

<h3>Order Prohibiting Education Bureau Chiefs from Leaving Office Lightly</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Education Department Instruction No. 824, Order to the education bureau chiefs of each county, states: For the purpose of compliance, it has been observed that the education bureau chiefs of various counties often resign due to minor difficulties or other obstacles, and some even entrust the bureau affairs to a substitute and leave their posts without prior approval. This has a significant impact on local education and is a failure to take public service seriously. From now on, the education bureau chiefs of each county must wait until the newly appointed bureau chief takes over before they are allowed to leave the county. Absolutely no one is allowed to leave their post without handing over the affairs and being irresponsible before the handover. Anyone who dares to violate this will be severely investigated. In addition to separate orders, this order is urgently issued for compliance, without fail.</p>

<h3>Appointment of Personnel by the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<h3>Junior High School Entrance Examination Proctors and Graders</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau is actively and diligently conducting the junior high school entrance examination. It is reported that in addition to the personnel assigned by the bureau, the proctors and graders will also include three representatives recommended by each of the following schools: Wuben Girls' High School, Jingye Middle School, Wusong Middle School, Daxia Affiliated High School, Jianguo Middle School, Junyi Middle School, Minli Middle School, Guangzhao Middle School, Minli Girls' High School, Shibei Middle School, Guanghua Affiliated High School, Fudan Affiliated High School, Chengzhong Middle School, Nanyang Middle School, and Pudong Middle School.</p>
<p>During the Municipal Education Bureau's Office Meeting</p>
<h3>Director Chen's Important Report</h3>
<p>Director Chen of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau reported at the 155th Office Meeting: (1) This month, due to the need to hold the entrance examination and other business, the work is relatively stressful. However, the purpose of the bureau in holding the entrance examination is simply to reorganize the education in this city and has no other purpose. However, the outside world does not understand the truth and has generated many rumors that the entrance examination is a prelude to suppression and takeover. However, I believe that to do things, one must have a firm determination, and rumors can be ignored. Therefore, no matter how difficult the entrance examination is, it must be carried out according to the established plan. If any school does not comply with the order, it will be punished accordingly. Even if this causes a great storm, I will accept it. There are many veteran educators in this city who, whenever an accident occurs, take the opportunity to make trouble and obstruct progress. Therefore, the inability to manage education in this city is actually affected by these educators. I have the responsibility and determination to reorganize education and will not shrink back in order to promote the development of education. I hope everyone will pay attention to this determination. (2) There are not many days left in this year, but there are still many tasks that have not been completed. The work seems to be too slow. It must be known that if anyone does not work hard, it will affect everyone from the director of the bureau to the clerk. If such a chronic disease is found in any staff member in the future, I will only enforce the law and will not be lenient. I hope the section chiefs will warn their colleagues to pay close attention. (3) From now on, staff attendance must be handled in accordance with the attendance rules. Senior personnel must also report to the director's office, and junior personnel must fill out attendance forms for assessment. Otherwise, the actions are too free and the discipline is too lax. Therefore, I solemnly declare that attention must be paid. (4) The end of this year is approaching. Various businesses within the scope of this year must also come to an end. I hope the sections and departments will carefully consider and complete them as soon as possible so that they can be clearly separated from the work of the next year. If there are not enough personnel, it is better to hire temporary personnel to help. Therefore, the office hours this month will be extended by one hour each day. It must be known that the situation in China is different from that in Europe and the United States. Under the current state of affairs in China, we can only use a sincere attitude and full energy to strive for the vigorous advancement of our cause, and we cannot imitate Europe and the United States in evenly distributing office hours, rest, and entertainment time.</p>

<h3>Ma Guli Gives a Lecture at the China Academy of Arts</h3>
<p>Dr. Ma Guli has always attached great importance to the literature and art of our country. The other day, he visited the China Academy of Arts (formerly known as the China Academy of Literature and Art) at the Ningbo Fellow Association and deeply appreciated the exhibition of works by teachers and students. Yesterday, he gave a lecture at the school accompanied by Dr. Ding Zhaoqing and Liu Suijiu, the founders of the school. Professors Zhang Hongwei, Ma Mengrong, Ma Gongyu, Zheng Manqing, and Fang Jiean entertained him. The main idea of the speech was that Chinese painting has always focused on freehand brushwork, while Western painting has always focused on realism, with the ability to resemble the real as the goal. However, after the invention of photography, it was realized that realism is not the ultimate goal of art, and the value of freehand brushwork was gradually understood. Therefore, European art today is gradually becoming Chinese. The words were very pertinent. After the speech, Liu Suijiu and Ding Zhaoqing gave speeches to further elaborate on Dr. Ma's ideas.</p>

<h3>Eulogy to the Martyrs of Lakeside Chen Boying</h3>
<p>Eulogy to the Martyrs of Lakeside is written to mourn the martyr Chen Ying shi. His courtesy name was Qimei, a native of Wuxing. He learned business as a child and went to Japan to study at the age of thirty. In the winter of that year, he joined the Tongmenghui. In the autumn of Xinhai, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. Jun led his comrades to attack the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau and broke it. The public then elected him as the Governor of the Shanghai Army. In the first year of the Republic of China, Yuan Shikai appointed him as the Minister of Industry and Commerce, but he refused and strongly opposed him. Several uprisings were unsuccessful. Yuan was afraid of him and sent his party to assassinate him in his residence, and he was killed. It was May 18th, the fifth year of the Republic of China. His tomb is located on the shore of Bilang Lake, beside the Xian Mountain, two or three miles outside the South Gate of Huzhou. I went to pay my respects more than ten days after this year's commemoration. There is a stone archway in front of the tomb. The front plaque is inscribed with the words "Achieving Benevolence and Taking Righteousness". There are couplets on the sides, saying, "Anecdotes are enough to prove that they can supplement the biographies of roaming heroes and merchants. Former sages are not allowed to let them, and they are indeed the first-class of Lu Lianzi and Fang." The back plaque says, "Gong De Feng Cen". The couplet says, "A grave buries Huang Chang, walking near Xian Mountain and shedding tears together. Three years of hiding Bixue, the sound is sad, Du Yuhe Zhao soul." Entering the lane, small trees are planted, half the height of a person. Entering again is the tomb gate. Passing the tomb gate is the tomb. The two sides are like embracing each other. There is a couplet saying, "Supporting the top and holding the danger, the cause is shining like the sun and the moon. Achieving benevolence and taking righteousness, looking up and down without shame, both heaven and man." There is a monument on it, inscribed with the words "The Tomb of Chen Gong Ying Shi", written by the former Premier. In front of the tomb are the words "The Spirit Is As Strong As Mountains And Rivers". The four walls are engraved with elegies and elegies, which cannot be fully recorded. The tomb is made of stone, simple and solemn, making people awe-inspiring. At that time, the color of the sun was slightly tragic, and a long wind came from the lake. Looking at the four mountains, it was like holding arms and waiting for them. There was no one else who came to the tomb. Thinking of the vastness of heaven and earth, calling the hero but not rising, all kinds of feelings were intertwined, and I couldn't help but linger for a long time. There is a ridge to the east of the tomb, and there is a pavilion on the ridge called Xiongkua Pavilion. There is a couplet saying, "The forests and valleys of the peaks in the southwest are especially beautiful. On the good days of spring and autumn, singing and weeping here." It is a collection of sentences, and it is neat and elegant, which can be called seamless. The first and last words are embedded in its beauty and the four characters of Dangsi are especially ingenious and cannot be achieved. The writer also put a lot of thought into it. After I came down, I regretted not bringing a pot of wine to pay tribute to the secluded spirit. After returning, I picked up a pen and wrote it down.</p>
<h3>A Toad Weighing Five Pounds Clear and Thin</h3>
<p>A few days ago, my friend Zhang Fulou told me that he had personally seen a native of Loudong get an extremely large toad, that is, he wanted to name the toad a "Lai Tuan," weighing more than five catties. The natives regarded it as a rare commodity and entered the city, hoping to get a good price for it. Some advised him to sell it to the pharmacy, which would definitely get a high price, but he did not succeed. Later, it was seen in a tea house in the city by a kind person who spent money to buy it and released it in the backyard to live in it, and allowed people to watch it. According to Yun, its thing is huge and unmatched, and it is like a turtle at first glance. Its hind feet are red and shiny, and the piles on its back are high and super like graves. They are all amazed as never seen before. Yu heard that foreign black people who travel far in the desert always cover their faces with Lai Tuan skin, feeling cool and incomparable. This thing is afraid of sunlight, and its body secretes a kind of viscous liquid from time to time to avoid it, so there is this utilization. Also, according to the Nanshi Yin Yan Biography, when the Western Expedition was made, large toad carts were made to carry scholars and cowhide to cover them, and pushed them to fill the trenches. It is clear that this thing has been created by those who have been in charge of the steering wheel, and it is not the creation of today.</p>

White butterfly flowers are slender and drooping, and the tables and chairs placed in the room are also moved out on this day to facilitate the display of flower planting. Other creeping grasses, daisies, etc. are arranged in neat rows and arranged properly. As for the tables in the garden, they are full of potted flowers, all of which are famous species. The most eye-catching is a table covered with embroidered tablecloths, with a flower basket placed on it, which is said to be the product of a certain school. Among the flowers placed in the basket, the golden yellow roses are the most precious. On the afternoon of this day, the guests gathered together. The costumes of Chinese women were unique, with long and short cheongsams of different colors, and the shadows of hairpins and hairpins were extremely prosperous for a while. And some female students from a certain school came to visit in blue cloth uniforms and small hats. It was also heard that Mr. Tang Shaoyi also came to visit on this day.

<h3>Rain Blocks the Huxin Temple National Walking Group Liu Hanru</h3>
<p>It has been three months since we set off. We have passed through a total of sixteen counties of all sizes. We arrived in Huaian, Jiangbei on National Humiliation Day. Recalling the daily life of these three months, we have not felt any hardship. And all comrades are physically strong and mentally active, which is worthy of comforting those who care about us. For the past three months, we have been running around and have not had a chance to rest. This time, we arrived in Huaian and, with the introduction of County Magistrate Wang Zhenyu, we were able to stay in the Huxin Temple in Meili for a few days, to sort out our work and take a little rest before moving on. The temple is located three miles west of the city of Huaian, with clear water and wood, and the halls and pavilions are solemn. Although it is not as large as Lingyin, the scenery is really good. At the entrance, there is a horizontal plaque that says "Huxin Suoyue", the anonymous person's surname is very similar to the handwriting of Qing Daoren. On the reverse side of the plaque, it says "Youji Keyuan", which was inscribed by Wu Changshuo. In the middle of the Kangxi period, Emperor Renmiao made a southern tour and personally wrote the three characters "Youji Temple" and gave it to the temple monks, so it is also known as Youji Temple. Outside the temple, there is a two-hundred-meter-long forest on the right side, and the same on the left side. Entering the temple gate, you must pass over a small bridge. On the opposite side of the bridge, there is also a plaque that says "City Mountain Forest", which was written by Zheng Xiaoxu. Outside the temple gate, in addition to the forest, there is also a vast courtyard, covering several acres, all planted with vegetables, called "Guachou", "Yuqu", and "Caiqi". The abbot's room is elegantly furnished, and the walls are full of calligraphy and paintings by celebrities. Abbot Hui specially opened the Mengjiao Mountain Room on the side of the Baojing Hall for us to stay. We ordinary vulgar people occupy the pure Buddhist land, which is very uneasy. On the evening of the 14th, Abbot Hui set up a vegetarian feast to wash us down. During the banquet, he talked about the history of the temple, and only then did we know that the temple was built in the Tang Dynasty and flourished in the early Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>There were only a few thatched huts, and the address was originally named Guanjia Lake. The temple is located in the heart of the lake, so it is named Huxin Temple. In the Jiawu year of Qianlong, the Lao Ba Kou River burst, and the river was silted up and leveled. After several repairs, it has the scale it is today. At the end, he presented a volume of Huxin inscriptions, all of which were poems left by famous people of the time. Being in this pure land, untouched by vulgar dust, hearing the sound of the Qing, makes the vulgar people have the thought of breaking away from everything and converting to the Three Jewels. We have been living here for a week, and we have been blocked by rain, which has prevented us from moving forward. Once the weather clears, we will go to Qingjiang. We have been greatly favored by the people from all walks of life in Huai'an, who have either given us lavish banquets or given us guidance and support, as well as the hospitality of County Magistrate Wang and the kindness of Abbot Hui, all of which are appreciated.</p>
<h3>The Battle of Throwing Stones in Lanxi</h3>
<p>Reading Mr. Gu Shide's article "The Stone-Throwing Festival" in a previous issue of this publication, one learns that this custom is not unique to Guangdong. However, whether this practice can truly avert disaster is something the author cannot know, sharing the same doubt as ascending heights on the Double Ninth Festival.</p>
<p>When the author was young, he would accompany elders to climb "Lianfeng Mountain" in Zhongshan. The scenery there was extremely serene and secluded. Looking down from the mountain, the roofs of houses resembled fish scales, and the fields were far away. The battle of throwing stones would invariably take place here every year. When the sun rose high in the sky, tourists gathered like ants. The two warring factions would each prepare large and small sharp stones as weapons, lying in wait at either end of the mountain. They would wait for the main combatant to light firecrackers, while spectators stood on the slopes, watching the outcome. The two sides would frequently hurl stones at each other in a rapid back-and-forth, with loud shouts to display their courage. Timid spectators, though highly interested, were also afraid of stray stones, so they watched with their heads covered. Those who cheered as if celebrating a victory. When one side ran out of stones, they would be in a dangerous situation, as the enemy would relentlessly pursue with stones, like wild horses charging across the mountain, causing broken heads and injured bodies. The results were often shocking. Those who sustained injuries not only did not feel distressed but even felt exhilarated, stopping the bleeding with yellow smoke. Their heroic spirit was enough to inspire the weak.</p>
<p>If one side was willing to admit defeat, they would raise a white flag as a sign of surrender, and the opposing side would wait for the main combatant to light firecrackers before ceasing hostilities.</p>
<p>After the battle, a banquet would typically be held. If there was no animosity between the two sides and it was merely a friendly competition, the victorious team would host a banquet for the defeated team, and they would celebrate together, not treating each other as enemies. If the battle was caused by revenge, the defeated party would offer a banquet as a sign of apology and as a congratulatory gift.</p>
<p>This kind of large-scale warfare was prevalent among the lower classes, but the upper classes did not engage in it, as the benefits were few and the harm was great, with injuries being inevitable. In recent years, Zhongshan County has vigorously reformed old customs, and it is unknown whether this kind of useless practice has been eliminated.</p>
<p>(P.S.) Mr. Gu's "My Village," I wonder which village it is? Please enlighten me.</p>

<h3>Theater News from Xindu: Xu Xiaoting</h3>
<p>The National Grand Theater of Xindu is located at a suitable location in Huapailou. Its construction is magnificent, and its facilities are complete. It is the only cinema in Xindu. This time, at the request of local residents Mr. Peng and Mr. Zhang, it made an exception to rent the place for a Mandarin opera performance to raise funds. Among those in charge are Mr. Sun Bowen, the commander of the Jiangning Fortress, and other famous figures. They specially invited Mr. Su Shaoqing to serve as the casting director. The dates are set for June 5th, 6th, and 7th, with six day and night performances, creating an unprecedented spectacle in Xindu. The repertoire has been set: Jin Shaoshan and Rui Debao's complete "Chain Trap," Jin Shaoshan and Xu Ziyi's (a famous amateur Tan-style beards from Nanjing) "Famen Temple," Jin Shaoshan and Liu Zhongqiu's (Shaoqing's talented student who collaborated with Bao Xiaodie at the Great China Company to record the "South Heaven Gate" record) "Yu Zangjian Assassinating King Liao," Jin Shaoshan's "Herding Tigers Pass," Rui Debao's "Picking the Flower Cart," "Ancient City Meeting," "Huarong Road," "Single Plank Bridge Pass," Zhang Wanyun and Jia Futang's (a famous amateur from Beiping who is on par with Qiu Guixian and is currently a storyteller for the China Public Theater) "Second Entry to the Palace," Zhuo Youqi's "Chengdu Zhaoguan Cursing Cao Tanning Mother," Guangdong female amateur Zheng Menglan's three Cantonese operas, and Kunqu operas such as Xu Laotaitai's "Wandering in the Garden," "Sweeping the Flowers," "Yearning for the Mortal World," and "Auspicious Date Making a Scene." In addition, there will be Beijing operas by famous amateurs from Su, Chang, Ning, and Xi. Because Shaoqing has to take care of everything, he will only perform in "Empty City Stratagem," with Shaoshan playing Ma Su, Debao accompanying Wang Ping, and Futang playing Sima Yi. This combination of talent is truly rare. The musicians are the two masters Sun Zuochen and Chen Yanheng, and the drummers are Yang Yulou and Luo Zhongquan, which makes it even more wonderful. Xindu has a population of three million people and has long suffered from a lack of theater. This large-scale performance will surely cause a sensation throughout the city. (Gratitude)</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (II)(O)(VI) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Green Curtains and Pearl Hairpins, Fair Lady Returns to a Fine Gentleman; Jade Pendants and Crimson Bed Curtains, Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family</p>
<p>Speaking to that point, Liu Xingshu smiled and said, "This has again sparked a round of your empty theories. I asked which of the three suitors, Ruiyun, is the best. According to what you've said, Ruiyun's heart must naturally be most inclined towards the youngest, Zhao Qi." Zuo Shuchen said, "This is just my personal conjecture. In any case, property is not an issue among the three conditions I mentioned. I've heard that all three are wealthy and are gentlemen of high standing. It's just that I don't know about the third issue I mentioned." Liu Xingshu said, "Why don't you try to find out? Did she marry that one? Are you not concerned at all? I'm very worried about it." Zuo Shichen said, "It's not that I'm not concerned, but I've been busy these past few days, so I haven't seen Ruiyun, and it's not good to ask her too eagerly. I'll naturally know when the festival arrives. But in these few days, I do want to go once to find out." After saying this, two more days passed, and Zuo Shichen went to Ruiyun's place. It was only five or six days away from the festival, but there were fewer and fewer customers in the tea rooms. The Shanghai business community values the three major festivals of the year, and there is a slight lull near the festivals, so they are inevitably a little busy. Secondly, there is a custom in the courtesan houses that hand towels must be paid for near the festivals. Usually, a towel is provided by the room attendants, but near the festivals, the towels are sent from the assistants. After the customers wipe with the towels, there is a customary reward. It's not that the towel is anything special, but it's a kind of hint for festival rewards. At that time, customers will take out reward envelopes of ten or twenty dollars. This towel later had a nickname called "Ciba Dumplings." This is just a towel, named after its shape. Some thrifty customers are afraid of eating Ciba dumplings, so they usually run very diligently, but they don't come during these few days. Therefore, the courtesan houses are much more idle. Zuo Shichen arrived at Ruiyun's place and asked, but Ruiyun hadn't returned yet. The old nanny was chattering and making noise, but she stopped when she saw Zuo Shichen coming. Seeing that she couldn't bear it anymore, the old nanny walked to the pavilion first, saying to Zuo Shichen, "Second Young Master, come in and sit down. I have something to tell you." Zuo Shichen followed her in and sat on a sofa, waiting to hear what she had to say. It must be about Ruiyun. The old nanny said hesitantly, "It's okay to tell you, Second Young Master. Our girl is going to be promoted." Zuo Shichen was stunned. What does she mean by "promoted"? The "girl" she's talking about is, of course, Ruiyun. Officials have promotions, which are called "promotions." Are the people in the courtesan houses the same as the people who work?</p>

<h3>Yarn Flower and Yarn Market Changes Several Times a Day</h3>
<p>Raw Cotton Soared, and the Gold Standard Fluctuated Unpredictably</p>
<p>Guangdong Sales Continued Smoothly, but Prosperity Is Difficult to Hope for in a Chaotic World.</p>
<p>The Situation in the Yarn Market Changed Several Times a Day. This Situation Was Entirely Due to the Continuous Plummeting of the Silver Price and the Soaring of the Gold Price, Which Caused Panic and Unpredictable Rises and Falls. Spot Sales Had Some Activity, but It Was Difficult to Increase Significantly Due to the Impact of the Current Situation. Therefore, It Once Circulated, but Raw Cotton Soared, and Foreign Exchange Shrank Strangely. The Future Was Difficult to Grasp.</p>
<p>The Futures Yarn Rose and Fell Unpredictably. Before the Exchange Member's Standard Market Opened, the Silver Price Continued to Fall Sharply, and the Gold Price Soared to About 600 Taels. The Buying Sound in the Business Market Reached Outdoors. For a Time, Sellers Were Suddenly Lacking, and the Situation Was Turbulent and Abnormal. Each Month Rose by 1.56 Qian. The Second Disk Rose by 34 Qian. The Third Closing Disk Fell Back Due to the News of the Gold Price. Profiteers Concluded. As a Result, Each Month Rose by 1249 Qian.

<h3>Cotton Market Under the Control of the Exchange Market</h3>
<p>In the Morning, the Forward Even Called a High of 1 Taels.</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, Major Clients Concluded, and There Was a Slight Fall Back.</p>
<p>The Condition of the Cotton Market Is Very Chaotic Because the Gold Market Is Soaring and the Exchange Rate Is Shrinking Madly. The Cotton Price Continues to Rise. Those Who Are Making New Purchases Are Swarming In, and Empty Households Are Greatly Frightened. The Tension in the Market Is Rarely Seen. The Market Seller's Hands Are Tied, and the Market Disk Calls a High of More Than One Taels. Later, Those Who Are Profiting Sold to Conclude, and the Market Situation Slightly Loosened, but Considering the Exchange Rate and the Joint Price of Indian Cotton, the Standard Flower Must Be at 423 Taels, so the Buyers of the Standard Flower Are All Looking at 40 Taels. The Cotton Market Is in the Midst of a Wave and Is Not Over Yet.</p>
<p>The New Flower Continued to Rise 3.5 Qian. Before the Exchange Han Standard Market Opened, the Gold Price Was Already Close to About 600 Taels. The Sellers in the Market Stopped, and the Buyers Cried Madly. The Prices Were Not Limited, and the Price Rose by 7 Qian. The November Rose by 1.2 Taels. Later, the Price Was Too High, Which Led to the Conclusion of Those Who Were Profiting, and There Were Also Major Clients Who Concluded, and the Market Situation Was Transferred to Loose and Fell Back. As a Result, It Still Rose by 2345 Qian. In the Afternoon, the Market Situation Was Flat. The Gold Market Fell Back and Fell by 1.5 Qian to 3 Qian. The Total Number of Transactions for the Day Was 81,100 Loads. The Closing Price of the Han Standard Is Listed on the Left.</p>

<h3>World Cotton Yarn Slump</h3>

<h3>The Price of Geng Rice in Zhongguan Gradually Increases, and Foreign Rice Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, about ten boats from various groups arrived, sales were average, and the price of high-quality North Geng rice remained unchanged, with the general price of top-grade rice opening at 21 yuan and 7 jiao, similar to the previous day. The price of Zhongguan white Geng rice gradually increased by half a jiao, due to the active consumption in this street. The situation is extremely good. The import and export of old Geng rice is quite large. The price of thin rice continues to tighten, opening high at 20 yuan. The buying interest from outside the customs is not weak. There are no goods arriving in Yangdu, Jianli Road for supply to Shanghai, and domestic rice merchants are completely focused on transporting foreign rice. Therefore, there are no goods being loaded and shipped, and they are hoping for supply of premium quality rice. As a result, the price of native premium rice has become stagnant. Due to the smooth sales, the price of foreign rice has risen by about 2 jiao, with high-quality goods above 18 yuan. The situation looks good. Although it rained all day, the trading was still strong.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Only a few boats arrived from the river. Sales in the market are still acceptable. Shops in the villages and towns of Suzhou, Tongzhou, Changzhou, and Xixi are all purchasing. The market is rising again by one or two jiao. The price of ordinary rice is around 19 yuan and 5 jiao. According to recent reports, the price of Geng rice in the north and south markets seems to be highest at 20 yuan on the surface, but in reality, it mostly exceeds this amount. In the South Shanghai region, the arrival of thin early rice is scarce, and sales are picking up. Prices continue to rise, with good quality rice priced at more than one jiao. There is an intermittent supply of indica rice due to the lack of a standard market. The price of white rice is extremely sluggish. Due to the weak inventory and arrivals, the market is gradually firming up, approaching one jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Rises Sharply in the Heavy Rain</h3>
<p>Silver and Money Brokers Suddenly Engage in Buying</p>
<p>Prices Rise More Than Two Fen for Each Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market rose even more sharply. Prices were surprisingly bullish after the opening both in the morning and afternoon. In the afternoon, during the first two trading sessions, due to heavy rain, silver and money brokers from outside the industry purchased forward contracts for flour, driving the price up to around 2 taels and 5 qian. However, the Wuxi brokers sold off their positions, so the price slightly retreated after the sharp rise. The closing prices were: June, up 1 fen 25; July, up 2 fen 75; August, up 2 fen 25; September, up 1 fen 7; October, up 3 fen; November, up 2 fen 25.</p>
<h3>The Standard Price of New Wheat Fluctuates by One Qian Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market opened with soaring prices for all months. During the afternoon session, due to the sharp rise in flour prices, more speculators outside the industry paid attention, and prices were even hotter. July and November both rose by a significant amount of 1 qian and 12 fen compared to the previous day. June, August, and September also rose by 8 or 9 fen. At the final close, June was up 2 fen, August was up 45 fen, September was up 2 fen, and October was up 6 fen. There were 700-800 bags of old wheat being offered, priced at 5 taels and 5 fen. New wheat arrivals were scarce, and the market sentiment was particularly good due to the rain. Nearly 1,000 bags were sold. Caishi wheat was priced at 4 taels and 7 qian 5 fen, Huzhou wheat at 4 taels and 6 qian 3 fen, and Jiading wheat at 4 taels and 5 qian 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Rises Sharply by Over Three Qian</h3>
<p>National Sugar Opens with 2,000 Bags and Remains Popular</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received reports from the producing areas that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.375, New York sugar futures were 1.50 for September, 1.59 for December, and 1.68 for March next year, each up by 3 fen compared to the previous report. May was at 1.74, also up by 2 fen. The spot price of Javanese sugar was 10 guilders, a sharp increase of 3.75 compared to the previous price. June sugar futures were priced at 9.50, July at 9.375, each up by 1.25, and August at 9.125, down by 1.25. The initial trading price of crude granulated sugar, due to the rapid contraction of the exchange rate, was 7 taels and 6 qian, and trading was quite active. The price rose from 7 taels 6 qian 2 fen 5 li to 6 qian 5 fen. In the after market the price rose to 7 taels 7 qian, and the supply was scarce. The asking price was 7 taels 8 qian, but buyers hesitated slightly, so no transaction resulted. Fine granulated sugar was priced at 7 taels 7 qian to 8 qian, No. 20 medium granulated sugar at 7 taels 5 to 5 qian 5 fen, and No. 10 Dutch red sugar at 6 taels. The market was bullish. The rise in Japanese sugar was even more severe, jumping by more than 3 qian, with a strong momentum to rise even higher. The prices for Minghua YT were 8 taels 3 qian to 3 qian 5 fen, YP at 8 taels 4 qian 5 fen to 5 qian, and YRO at 7 qian 9 qian to 8 taels. All of these were popular. Only Taikoo Sugar B remained, with the asking price at 8 yuan and 8 jiao in Hong Kong dollars, up 3 jiao compared to the previous price, but no one was asking about it. National Sugar opened with 2,000 bags of Zhen brand, priced at 8 taels and 3 qian, and Shi brand at 8 taels. The market sentiment was still popular. The Shanghai and China No. 2 factories, which are also under the National Sugar banner, increased their prices by 2 qian, with the Ren and Zhong brands both priced at 10 taels and 4 qian, and the Qian and Hua brands both priced at 10 taels and 2 qian. The market situation was quite firm. The two factories are tightening their sales because the spot price of raw sugar has risen sharply.</p>
<h3>Drastic Changes in Silk Exchange Rate Make Tea Market Even More Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in Shanghai was even quieter. There were no transactions for green tea from Tunxi and Suian. There were also no large transactions for Qimen black tea. High-grade black tea has already become scarce. The British market is not in urgent need of medium and low-grade goods. In addition, the price of gold has risen sharply and the exchange rate has fluctuated drastically. Therefore, most merchants are adopting a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3>Spring Chinese Silk Exports to the US are Slightly Stronger</h3>
<p>Eight Thousand Plus Packs in Jan-Feb, Over Ten Thousand in March</p>
<p>Chinese silk is the largest export trade, especially sales to the United States. The monthly export volume to the United States is mostly as high as four or five thousand packs, and no less than two or three thousand packs. This spring, because the US government has set a deadline of May 1 to impose import silk taxes, and silver prices are also cheap (Chinese silk trade is valued in taels), and the Japanese silver price is slowly rising, so American silk merchants are abandoning Japanese silk in favour of the processing of Chinese silk. American firms are actively transporting their existing stocks to the United States, so exports are more active. According to statistics, the export of Chinese silk to the United States in January was 8,708 packs, in February 8,221 packs, and in March 10,551 packs. During the same period last year, they were only more than 4,000 to 5,000 packs.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Silver Price Continues to Plunge</h3>
<p>Chinese Gold Continues to Leave the Country, Foreign Silver Continuously Imports</p>
<p>Gold Prices Soar, Silver Prices Plunge</p>
<p>The Whole Country is on the Verge of Bankruptcy, the Government Has No Solution</p>
<p>The price of silver has been gradually declining since January of this year. Today, the fall is even more severe. The whole country is shaken, saying that its devastation is greater than that of artillery fire. The Chinese authorities have been deliberating on ways to save the situation for some time, but no measures have been taken until recently, when the export ban of silver was implemented. But yesterday, the North China Daily News said that the result of the silver export ban is the opposite. When the ban was implemented, there were less than 3,000 gold bars in Shanghai. However, the total amount of miscellaneous gold from the mainland has greatly increased. The price of gold bars is close to 600 taels. There will be even more mainland gold bars and gold ornaments collected in Shanghai. There are also proposals to levy import silver tax to compensate in one or two ways, as said by the China Press. But a few days ago, the government firmly denied that there was such a proposal. What is the solution to saving the situation? This has to rely on the comprehensive planning of national economists and implement it as soon as possible. The situation has now become like a prairie fire. It is no longer possible to take a bystander attitude and let it take its course. The shocking news of yesterday is recorded as follows</p>
<p>Gold Prices Continue to Soar: At the Gold Exchange yesterday morning, the opening price was 577 taels, the highest was 598 and a half taels, and the afternoon closing price was 587 taels and 8 qian. The price of gold ornaments at Datong Silver Shop was 83 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Silver Still Being Imported: Since the National Government ordered the ban on foreign silver imports, the United Kingdom and the United States have still shipped large silver bars. The Japanese mail ship Hakusan Maru has arrived in Shanghai and loaded 216 large silver bars shipped from London, which have been unloaded. It is reported that a U.S. liner will arrive in Shanghai next Monday with a large batch of U.S. silver bars. It is still unknown whether they will be unloaded in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Investigation of Chinese Gold Being Transported to the United States: Yesterday, according to a reliable investigation in financial circles, from January to the end of March this year, a total of 275,156 cash bars were transported from China to New York in three months, accounting for 39,308 gold cakes (each 10 taels as one bar, every 7 bars become one cake) worth 5,687,410 US dollars, with an average of 42 yuan, equivalent to 13,541,450 taels of Shanghai silver. Already shocking enough, but the exports in April were even more alarming. During the entire month, there were 184,793 bars, accounting for 26,399 gold cakes worth 3,711,344 US dollars, with an average of 40 yuan, equivalent to 9,278,360 taels of Shanghai silver, actually exceeding the average number of exports in the above three months by more than one time. In May, because the government banned exports, they did not dare to openly report to customs and direct shipping. Because there are no detailed statistics for the exact number, there are still more than 100,000 bars of amounts exported by private transport, other goods, false reports, or smuggling that can be observed in the trade. In addition, in recent years, the old gold ornaments collected by silversmiths have been melted into cakes, which is uncountable.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth Industry Appeals: The Shanghai Special City Cotton Cloth Association submitted a document to the Shanghai Merchants Federation saying: "Respectfully, according to reports from our members, they have sent representatives to the association, claiming that the price of silver continues to fall, causing a drastic contraction. Not only is there no turnaround, but new prices are also emerging repeatedly. The government has stated that it will provide relief, but so far there are no specific measures. If this continues, all of us in the industry, as well as import and export merchants, will be in a desperate situation. Please refer to the Shanghai Merchants Federation to quickly unite relevant groups and appeal to the government to provide relief to alleviate our suffering." After checking, since the price of gold is expensive and the price of silver is cheap, our industry has been the first to bear the brunt, and other industries have also been greatly affected, causing Shanghai's finances to become unstable. Suspensions and bankruptcies occur from time to time. The crisis is hidden, and the dangers are all around. The seriousness of the situation is unbearable. If no remedies are taken quickly, it will inevitably lead to economic bankruptcy. This city is the center of commerce and the hub of finance. A single hair affects the whole body, and the disaster will spread to the whole country. Considering this, we are deeply worried. We believe that the Shanghai Merchants Federation leads the merchants and has always been committed to protecting the welfare of merchants and alleviating their suffering. For this precarious situation, we should have plans to respond and report the situation. We hope that you will convene an emergency meeting and invite representatives from the chambers of commerce of various countries to attend the meeting to discuss solutions. On the one hand, we will unite relevant groups and appeal to the government for relief to save the crisis and alleviate the suffering of merchants. With utmost urgency, we await your command." To the Shanghai Merchants Federation.</p>
<p>The Ninth District Party Department Telegraphs: The Ninth District Party Department of this city believes that the gold market has recently undergone a drastic change, with the highest price of more than 577 taels, which has created a new record that has never been seen before. People are in danger and cannot live in peace. The cause of this is directly due to the contradiction between the exchange rate and extreme imperialism. The exchange rate is indirectly affected by the speculative market. The only solution at present is for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to order the gold market to stop operations immediately in accordance with Article 41 of the Exchange Law because it endangers the public interest and disturbs public security. Then, find other ways to remedy the situation. As for the people, the united use of domestic products is one way to stop the loss of foreign exchange and save the national economy. Therefore, the City Executive Committee was specifically presented with a request to send a telegram to the central government to inform the National Government for verification so as to stabilize social morale and consolidate the rear order. The original presentation was thousands of words long, which is omitted here.</p>
<p>Japan Should be Held Responsible: The Wenhui Daily reported that the contraction of the foreign exchange market has created a strange situation that has never happened before. This morning (the 4th), the British exchange rate was reduced to one shilling, five pence, and two qian. The price of gold rose to 596 taels. Even at 2:30 in the afternoon, the price was still 586 taels and 5 qian. The market is unusually chaotic. There is no way to predict the future trend. Rumors are rife. Only time will tell how it ends up. According to the Japanese Mainichi Shimbun, Japan's gold ban is responsible for a large part of the reason why the price of silver has fallen so badly this year. Everyone knows that the Indian government's sale of silver and the large amount of silver flowing into China and hoarding in Shanghai are the main reasons for the fall in the price of silver. I don't know that Japan has a great relationship. In order to prevent the outflow of cash after the Japanese government lifted the ban, it asked various foreign exchange banks to provide spiritual assistance. Therefore, banks such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi absorbed cash in Shanghai after lifting the ban and transported it to the United States. According to the US Department of Commerce and the San Francisco Federation Reserve Bank, the amount of cash transferred to the United States in the past four months is as follows:</p>
<p>January: From Japan: ¥721,485. From China: ¥99,253</p>
<p>February: From Japan: ¥40,906,014. From China: ¥1,809,703</p>
<p>March: From Japan: ¥38,315,706. From China: ¥3,711,344</p>
<p>April: From Japan: ¥16,425.</p>
<p>(Translator's note: This table may contain omissions. According to statistics, the gold bars transferred to the United States from Shanghai in January to April alone were worth US$9,398,754.)</p>
<p>Looking at the above table, the cash transported to the United States from China has increased sharply since March, and the gold bars transported to Japan in April are also worth ¥2 million. This is why the Nanjing government had to ban the export of gold. The balance of gold and silver reserves in the Shanghai market has been lost, resulting in a sharp drop in the price of silver. As a result, the London and New York silver markets were affected, and the repercussions were enough to affect the Shanghai market. Therefore, the export of cash in the Shanghai market has actually been doubly affected, and the cause of this is the Japanese government. However, after the sharp drop in the price of silver, Sino-Japanese trade has been at a disadvantage, especially the export of Japanese cotton yarn to China. As a result, Japanese financiers and large merchants of yarn, cloth, sugar, and flour have blamed their government for lifting the ban too early and for the errors in the policies adopted after lifting the ban.</p>
<p>Quickly Implement Silver Tax Collection: The China Press editorial on the 4th said that the price of the British pound has risen to 19 yuan, and the price of silver has plummeted. The trend of the downward trend is increasing every moment. What will be the final result? China's bankruptcy is imminent, and it is useless to flatter the officials. If we do not find a way to stop the influx of low-priced silver like a raging tide in this major commercial port, China will be in ruin. Is there a political relationship between the foreign financiers' cruel actions and only one way to resist foreign activities? This matter must be dealt with with courage. We believe that even if the government levies silver taxes at this time, it can still make up for the loss and allow struggling merchants and bankers to benefit slightly. Today, it is not only these two types of people who are in danger of bankruptcy. The whole country is in this danger. What will be the result? It's unthinkable. Alas, China is now able to fight bravely on the battlefield. Why is it so cowardly and indecisive behind the battle? France's Poincaré once said that only courage and creativity can save a country's bankruptcy. Today, if China wants to save the situation, it must immediately implement resolute plans. The country's misfortunes can produce such great people? Now is the time.</p>

<h3>Report on the Work of the Rescue Team in the Front</h3>
<p>Captain Bao Sends a Telegram to Request Remittances</p>
<p>The departure of the Chinese Red Cross Rescue Team was reported in the previous report. Yesterday, the captain of the team sent a telegram from Xuzhou, saying that Vice President Yu and Chairman Wang were in charge of the team working at the Jiulishan Wounded Soldiers Hospital with the Ministry of Health. Today, more wounded soldiers from the front came to Xuzhou and asked the team to take them in for treatment, which has now been done. The burial team has set off for the front line on the last day, but the team is in great need of funds. Please send a remittance as soon as possible. Bao Kangning Jiang, who leads the team, asked. The Executive Committee of the Society is trying to raise funds.</p>
<h3>The Arsenal Still Worked as Usual Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Loss in the Bullet Loading Room the Day Before Yesterday was Very Small</p>
<p>Guo Chengen, director of the Shanghai Arsenal, told the National News Agency reporter yesterday that at 8:10 a.m. on Tuesday morning, an explosion suddenly occurred when workers gathered in the bullet loading room. The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated by experts, but there is absolutely no sabotage by villains. Because all the workers used have been serving for a long time and are extremely reliable, and the defense is strict and no strangers can break in. The material loss in this explosion was very small, worth less than 6,000 yuan. Because the loading of medicine is all done manually and not by machines, so is the material loss is not large. Unfortunately, six people died on the spot and twenty-five were injured, several of whom were seriously injured. The bullet loading room is far away from the manufacturing factory, so the factory has not been affected at all. It is still working as usual without any interruption.</p>

<h3>Belgian Ambassador Aloys Van de Vyvere Scheduled to Return to Beiping</h3>
<p>Banquet for Wang Zhengting and Others on the 6th</p>
<p>Belgian Ambassador Aloys Van de Vyvere came to Shanghai from Beiping some time ago, and it was heard that he was welcomed by the former Belgian Foreign Minister Paul Van den Broeck. Now it is learned that Paul Van den Broeck is scheduled to come to China in about October this year. Since the Belgian Ambassador has no other official business in Shanghai, he decided to return to Beiping immediately. Chen Shiguang and Liu Yunfang, the director and deputy director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, visited the Belgian Ambassador at the Hua Fan Hotel a few days ago. According to his statement, he has no special task for this trip to the south, and since his friend, French Ambassador Madé, is about to go to Japan to take office, he has decided to take a boat back to Beiping on the 7th to say goodbye. But before returning to Beiping, he hopes to have a meeting with Minister Wang. Yesterday, according to news from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Wang must come to Shanghai within one or two days. The Belgian Ambassador has scheduled a banquet at the Hua Fan Hotel at 8 p.m. on the 6th to invite Minister Wang and invite Chinese and foreign celebrities to accompany him. Minister Wang will come to Shanghai this time and have some contact with Japanese Acting Ambassador Mamoru Shigemitsu in Shanghai.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Navy Plans</p>
<h3>Additional Purchase of New Survey Vessels</h3>
<p>Drawing from the Boxer Indemnity Fund for Purchase</p>
<p>Dedicated to Surveying, Not to Be Used for Other Purposes</p>
<p>The Hydrographic Office directly under the Naval Department, located at Fenglin Bridge in this city, currently lacks sufficient survey vessels to allocate for its work. In order to plan for the development of surveying tasks, it is proposed to draw from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to purchase several new survey vessels to facilitate operations. A draft proposal for drawing funds has been submitted to the Naval Department for review by the National Government. The original text of the proposal is excerpted as follows: (1) Purchase two new survey vessels fully equipped with all kinds of new surveying instruments; (2) These two vessels should be built in British Hong Kong, ready for use upon arrival; (3) The contract should specify that these two vessels are exclusively for surveying purposes and not for other equipment; (4) Allocate the remaining funds to a trusted organization designated by both parties, specifically for the annual repair and consumption of the two new vessels. Funds should not be used for any other purposes unrelated to surveying. The department believes that surveying rivers and seas benefits domestic and foreign merchants, ensuring the safety of all voyages, which is a matter of international public interest. Drawing from the Boxer Indemnity Fund will surely gain British sympathy. Instructions have already been given to the office to comprehensively plan and draft a proposed budget for submission to the department for approval.</p>
<h3>Two Telegrams from Guangxi on Saving the Provincial Capital</h3>
<p>The Guangxi Provincial Capital Salvation Association in Shanghai was established on [day omitted]. The association's address is temporarily located at No. 105 Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession. The following two telegrams issued by Jiang on [day omitted] to the Guangxi Provincial Defense Corps and the Guangxi Army generals have been recorded: (1) To the Defense Corps: It is reported that Li, Huang, and Bai have fled to the border of Hunan, distributing rifles before their departure and using the name of the police commissioner of each district to coerce and prepare to seize territory by force in the event of victory. If defeated, they will return to their old nest and continue to fight desperately. Guangxi is not the private property of Li and Huang, and the militia is not the docile servant of a single surname. Now that the communist bandits are rampant, it is the responsibility of your corps to protect the local area. If the rebels return in desperation, you should unite to resolutely reject them to avoid causing war and harming the local people. The love of one's homeland is shared by all. I trust that you will not be tempted and plunge thousands of compatriots into misery. This is my sincere plea; I hope you will consider it. (2) To the Guangxi Generals: Li, Huang, and Bai have hijacked the people's armed forces as their tools of struggle, coercing our armed comrades to go astray. Years of hard fighting have resulted in great sacrifices. Recently, they hastily left Guangxi and fled to the border of Hunan, abandoning their homeland. Thinking of the future, I feel deeply saddened. Your patriotism and love for your homeland are well known. How can you bear to sacrifice the glory of the past revolution for the sake of a few private intentions? I hope you will make a decision as soon as possible to abandon the rebels and follow righteousness, preserve your strength, and defend the local area to make up for past mistakes and preserve your reputation. It is not too late to rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff. This is my sincere advice; I hope you will take it.</p>
<h3>Recent Statistics on Chinese Goods Shipped to the United States</h3>
<p>According to a survey, the total value of Chinese export goods shipped to the United States from January to April of this year was US$455,722,01, which is a considerable increase compared to last year. However, the US government has planned to change its tax system, and Chinese goods shipped to the United States from May onwards will inevitably decrease.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Meeting on Preventing Rice Stem Borers</h3>

<h3>Huzhou Society Telegrams Requesting Protection for Cocoon Merchants</h3>
<p>The Huzhou Society Committee previously telegraphed the authorities requesting measures to protect cocoon merchants. Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and County Magistrate Gong of Wuxing both replied, promising strict protection. The telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) Telegram from the Huzhou Society to Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and County Magistrate Gong of Wuxing: Almost every village in Wuxing is subject to banditry and kidnapping. Recently, major cases of looting have occurred in Si'an and Shanlian. As the cocoon market opens, cocoon merchants going inland to collect cocoons are afraid to travel due to the widespread presence of bandits. If measures are not taken urgently to provide proper protection, the livelihood of the people will become even more unbearable, and the government's revenue will also continue to decline. We request that heavy troops be dispatched to station in key villages and towns to provide protection and benefit the people's livelihood. We cannot express enough our gratitude. The entire Executive Committee of the Huzhou Society respectfully inquires. (2) Reply from Chairman Zhang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Huzhou Society: I have received your telegram. I have repeatedly ordered the commanders of bandit suppression in Huzhou to strictly protect the area. Reply from Zhang Renjie (seal). (3) Reply from County Magistrate Gong of Wuxing to the gentlemen of the Huzhou Society Executive Committee: I have received your telegram respectfully. The cocoon trade in Wuxing this year has increased by one hundred percent compared to last year. I have already submitted a request to the provincial government to add troops to Wuxing for protection and convened a meeting of the army, navy, and police before the market opened to discuss defense measures to ensure thoroughness. I am sending this telegram in reply for your information. Gong Shinong, County Magistrate of Wuxing (seal).</p>
<h3>Approximate Amount of Zhejiang Tea Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>7,162 Boxes Have Arrived</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is transporting boxed tea produced in Jin, Qu, Yan, and other places in Zhejiang Province to Shanghai for sale overseas. Huitong and Maoshuntai Transfer Companies have contracted with the railway bureau to transport the tea. Shipping began in late last month, and the tea has been continuously loaded at the Gate Station and transported to Shanghai. As of yesterday, the approximate amount that had arrived in Shanghai was 7,162 boxes. It is reported that there are still over 5,000 boxes of tea loaded onto barges at Shangjiang waiting to be transported to the Gate Station, all of which need to be loaded onto trains. Therefore, freight trains have been running daily from the station to Shanghai, and it is estimated that the total number of boxes of tea will be around 200,000 by the end of the season.</p>
<h3>Decline in Upriver Yangtze Shipping</h3>
<p>River Steamers Change to Coastal Routes</p>
<p>British Companies Reduce Ships, Starting This Month, the Yangtze Upriver Business Has Sharply Declined, With No Goods for Import or Export. One of the Hunan-bound steamers of the Nissin Company has been suspended. British companies operating on the Yuezhou, Shashi, Xiangtan, and Changsha routes have also suspended their regular steamers due to lack of cargo and have temporarily dispatched several tugboats to load scattered goods in Hunan and Hubei. The Taikoo Company decided yesterday to temporarily suspend the Chongqing steamer, which was originally running the Shanghai-Hankou route, and switch it to the Beiyang route because the Yangtze River was short of cargo. It is unusual for a Yangtze River steamer to be transferred to a coastal route.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Head to Hunan. The First Japanese Overseas Expeditionary Force has dispatched six warships, including the Sumida and Ataka, to Yuezhou and further to Changsha. Furthermore, Commander Minai of the fleet personally led the shallow-draft warships Atami and Futami, along with a naval group, to continue to Changsha.</p>
<p>River Pilots Return to Work. Foreign steamships operating on the Yichang-Chongqing route were opposed to the increase in salary for river pilots. After the Japanese and American ships agreed to increase salaries, British steamships such as Taikoo and Jardine Matheson resolutely refused to increase them, and the foreign companies hired their own drivers. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. It is reported that the situation has been mediated by various parties, and the British companies have also realized the difficulty of operating on the Sichuan River and have accepted the demands of the river pilots, agreeing to appropriately increase their salaries. Starting this month, all Chinese river pilots on foreign steamships operating upriver have returned to work.</p>
<h3>County Finance Bureau Urges Payment of Old Debts</h3>
<p>Wang Li, Director of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau, found that the amount of old rice tax and other tax revenues owed in the county was enormous. During this time of military affairs, the provincial government is urgently urging the remittance of funds, so it is imperative to organize the collection. Therefore, he summoned the heads of the six districts under the county at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the matter, ordering that the old rice tax owed from the 17th and 18th years of the Republic be paid in full within five mao (five days per mao). Those who are lazy or deliberately resist will be reported for arrest. Furthermore, Director Wang believes that there is still over 10,000 yuan of old rice tax owed from the 16th year of the Republic when the city and county were not divided. The original collectors should be held responsible for urging payment. Therefore, he ordered that the collectors who have been assigned to the city should be summoned to the bureau today to discuss the matter, limiting the time for urging payment in order to emphasize national taxation.</p>
<h3>End of Labor Conscription for Road Construction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau received instructions from the Jiangsu Construction Department stating that labor conscription for road construction in various counties should be temporarily suspended due to the current busy farming season. The labor conscription and road construction promotion associations, labor conscription and road construction offices, and labor conscription assistants set up for labor conscription and road construction should be abolished. Furthermore, the number of personnel used by the highway offices attached to various bureaus is still considerable and should be effectively reduced to comply with the principle of austerity policy. The temporary technicians set up by various counties for labor conscription and road construction are similar in nature to labor conscription assistants and should also be abolished at the same time. If counties need to carry out supplementary surveying, supervision, and construction of bridges and culverts, they should be allocated separately according to the needs of the work and reported for verification. Director Wu is now complying with the order and reporting the progress of labor conscription and road construction to the Construction Department for approval.</p>
<p>Shipping Merchants in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Continued Report on Opposition to Foreign Steamships Stopping at Anqing</h3>
<p>Requesting the Anhui Provincial Government to Fundamentally Cancel This Case</p>
<p>The Anhui authorities' approval for foreign steamships to dock at Anqing and establish public docks to collect taxes has been opposed by shipping merchants in Shanghai. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has replied to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, agreeing to consult with the Anhui Provincial Government to temporarily suspend this case, not wanting to benefit some at the expense of others. After the reply arrived in Shanghai, shipping merchants still considered it unsatisfactory because temporary suspension is not a fundamental cancellation. Li Fang, who proposed the establishment of docks, stated in his original report that "when I was in Anqing, various provincial government agencies believed that foreign ships coming and going to that place did not have wharves and did not anchor to pick up and drop off passengers, which was very dangerous. They instructed me to negotiate with the three foreign steamship companies to request that they dock at public wharves in the future." This statement completely ignores the facts. Steamships of Taikoo, Nissin, and Jardine Matheson have always stopped at Anqing without exception, and passengers and cargo have always been transported by private boats. Only the China Merchants and Sanbei steamships have been docking at the Anqing docks, with seventeen steamships. After the situation was stabilized, at least two steamships of Ning, Shao, Zhao, and Xing came and went every day. Even now, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's steamships are running daily. Yesterday, the shipping merchants decided on two measures: (1) First, order the Anqing branches to vigorously organize the docking of Chinese steamships at the docks to make it very convenient for passengers to embark and disembark, to prevent foreigners from making excuses. (2) The shipping merchants will submit a second report to the Ministry of Communications, requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consult with the Anhui Provincial Government to fundamentally cancel this case to comply with the government's intention to reclaim navigation rights.</p>
<p>Commercial Ship Driving Association Requests</p>
<h3>Each Steamship to Add Third Mates and Apprentices</h3>
<p>The Shipping Association yesterday sent a letter to various steamship companies stating that it had previously received a letter from the China Merchant Ship Drivers Association stating that recently, whenever shipping companies in various places purchased ships or replaced foreign crew members, they wanted to hire Chinese, but Chinese often lamented the lack of talent. The reason is that although Chinese have emerged later, there is no shortage of people, but there are too few opportunities for practical apprenticeship, and there is a lack of experience, so it is often inconvenient to entrust them with important tasks. If this is not changed urgently, it is feared that after ten years, there will still be a shortage of Chinese navigators. Therefore, the association has repeatedly convened meetings and unanimously decided on two proposals: one is to request the government to designate steamship companies in various places to add third mates and apprentices, and the other is to discuss whether your association can automatically add third mates and apprentices. The general outline of the resolution at that time was that all ships navigating along the coast, regardless of size, must add two to four apprentices. Those with a gross tonnage of more than 2,000 tons or a sea voyage of more than five days should add one third mate. How to treat these crew members should be considered by your association to provide the best method so that both the capital side and the crew members can benefit. The association believes that only in this way can the navigators who emerge later have sufficient opportunities for practical experience, so that in the near future, we can avoid the criticism of borrowing talents from foreign countries. The association believes that our country is in a situation where various imperialist forces are invading, and only by uniting the whole country and cooperating in all aspects can we compete for survival. Your association is wise and understands, and I dare to offer the above suggestions for your consideration. I hope you will reply as soon as possible, etc. This was submitted to the 6th Executive Supervisory Committee meeting on May 31 for discussion. It was unanimously decided that in recent years, Chinese shipping has been affected by various factors and has reached its extreme point. It is difficult to maintain if expenses are increased again, and training maritime talents cannot be delayed. Each company has to consider the situation and try to recruit as much as possible for training and to protect navigation rights. The association will send letters to each member for consideration and reply to the association, etc. The case is recorded and presented for your reference and consideration.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Agreed on Joint Defense Measures</h3>
<p>Party, Military, Police, and Business Groups Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday and Reached a Resolution</p>
<p>Factories are densely located in the Caojiadu area of Shanghai West. Fearing that there are reactionary elements hiding among them, the Party Headquarters of the Third District has sent letters to the military and police agencies in the district to solicit plans for prevention. As a result, each agency believed that mutual cooperation in prevention was essential. Therefore, a joint meeting of Party, military, police, business, and other groups was held at the Caojiadu Defense Corps at 2:00 PM yesterday. Duan Shaozhong (military), Zhang Yichen, Tang Liqing (Party), Yang Chen (Youth League), Zhu Rongping, Zhu Zhixian (business), and Ren Liping (police) attended. Tang Liqing was elected chairman. After the chairman reported on the matter, the discussion began. The meeting agreed on several joint defense measures, etc.</p>
<h3>Citizens' Federation Drafts Articles of Association</h3>
<p>Establishment of Branches Rejected</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Federation previously submitted a request to the Municipal Party Headquarters to establish branches to facilitate operations. The request was instructed that it was not in line with the original purpose of establishing the association and could not be approved. The second Standing Committee meeting decided to draft remedial measures for the establishment of branches and submit them for approval. It was also decided to ask the former drafting committee members Yan E, Sheng Xinzhao, and Wang Pingnan to draft measures and submit them for approval, along with a resolution to set the monthly membership fee at two jiao or more. Letters have been sent to Yan, Jiang, and Wang to prepare the measures and drafting rules as soon as possible for submission for approval.</p>
<p>Postal Headquarters</p>
<h3>Ordered to Prepare for the Weihaiwei Post Office</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has resolved the negotiation to recover the leasehold of Weihaiwei. British post offices have already been established in the area and Liugong Island. As the recovery is imminent, the necessary equipment for postal services and savings and remittance businesses should be prepared in advance to meet public needs after the takeover. Therefore, the Postal Headquarters and the Savings and Remittance Headquarters are instructed to carefully prepare and report the progress of the preparation at any time.</p>
<p>Yesterday</p>
<h3>Second General Meeting of the Chinese Medicine Association</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second general meeting of the Shanghai Special City Chinese Medicine Association. It was held at the Ningbo Fellow Association. More than 300 members and 60 guests attended. Xie Liheng, Ding Zhongying (represented by Guo Boliang), and Cai Jiping were elected as the presidium. Chen Yaotang was the master of ceremonies, and Chen Cunren and Cheng Diren were the recorders. The meeting began at 3:00 PM with a ceremony. First, the chairman reported: (1) At the beginning of the association's preparation, the Central Health Committee abolished the Chinese medicine case. The association then convened national medical groups to promote the National Medical Association. This is the most obvious external work of the association. (2) In order to cultivate talents, the association has taken over the Chinese Medical College for a year and has made considerable achievements. This is the most practical internal work of the association. In addition, all association affairs are detailed in the association publication, etc. Then, Yu Hongsun of the Finance Section reported on the income and expenditure briefly. Then, Jiang Wenfang of the Constitution Revision Committee stated his opinions and proposed a draft amendment, which was discussed article by article and passed. Then, the proposal was discussed. Cai Jiping and Sheng Wenfang proposed (1) Maintaining the development of members' businesses and the effectiveness of medical care. A total of six articles were passed in principle. (2) Expanding the organization of the association. A total of three articles were passed. (3) Asking various academic groups to subsidize the association's expenses. The resolution was passed in principle. The methods for the above three cases will be discussed and implemented by the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees. Due to the large number of proposals, there was not enough time for discussion due to time constraints. All discussions were handed over to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees for discussion and handling. Then, the successor executive and supervisory committee members were elected. After a group photo, the meeting adjourned at 5:10 PM.</p>

<h3>Major Fight in a Laundry Shop</h3>
<p>Abdomen Burned by a Red-Hot Iron</p>
<p>Head Covered in Blood from a Door Bolt</p>
<p>A laundry shop opened by a certain Jia, a native of Shaoxing, at the entrance of Mingyangli, Manzhou Road, Zhabei, had a certain Gao Yunbo, a native of Tianjin, come to pick up a washed and ironed long gown the other day. Shop assistant He Chuer asked for the washing and ironing fee, and Gao said that he would deliver it to your boss another day, but He refused and scolded Gao for being a pig and putting on airs. Gao refused to accept this and got into a scuffle with He. At that time, another shop assistant, Chen Fuchun, was ironing clothes with a red-hot iron. Seeing Gao beat up his colleague, Chen immediately held the red-hot iron toward Gao in a threatening manner. Gao was afraid and pushed He violently, causing him to fall on Chen. Chen accidentally held the iron and touched his abdomen, causing the red-hot iron to burn his abdomen, scorching the skin and flesh. A piece of skin was burned off, and the blood and flesh were bright red, which was a terrible sight. At that time, a group of people outside the door named Qiu Songshan saw that their colleague was in trouble and immediately grabbed a door bolt and hit Gao's head hard. Gao was quick-eyed and agile and dodged the blow, but the stick hit He Chuer's forehead, creating a hole. Because he used his hand to block the stick, the iron hoop on the stick pierced his tiger's mouth, causing a wound about three-fen deep, and blood flowed all over his body. Then, the fourth assistant Chen Yuzhang stepped forward and threw Gao to the ground, and Qiu Songshan and Chen Yuzhang肆行 together, causing him to suffer several injuries from the wooden stick. Then, patrol officer Zhang Pinsan arrived and brought the group of people to the First Sub-Bureau of the Fourth District and transferred them to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for questioning.</p>

<h3>Information Received by the Huining Fellow-Villagers Association Regarding Police Expenses in Jing County</h3>
<p>The Huining Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai received a letter yesterday from Xiao Zhiquan, captain of the First Guerrilla Squad of the People's Self-Defense Corps in Jing County. It stated that on the night of May 29 at 2:00 AM, the squad's second squad leader reported hearing gunshots in the city. Upon receiving the report, the squad immediately directed all armed personnel to strengthen their posts and deploy defenses in the eastern part of the city. The captain personally led five members to investigate the truth. While passing through East Street, they encountered over seventy mutineering soldiers who opened fire. After a thirty-minute street battle, the squad, outnumbered, suffered the death of squad member Luo Jinbiao. For self-preservation, they had to retreat to the outside of the East Gate temporarily. They then led their troops back to attack, vigorously pursuing the mutineering soldiers, who fled toward the outside of the North Gate. The squad is now maintaining order in the city. In addition to pursuing and suppressing the mutineers, the captain fears that fellow villagers abroad may misunderstand the situation and become anxious. He is therefore reporting the facts and hopes the association will investigate.</p>

<h3>Fearless Sleeper</h3>
<p>Feels Deeply Uneasy in America</p>
<p>Will Ask the American Consulate for Explanation</p>
<p>The lawsuit caused by the "Fearless Sleeper" film has been going on for nearly three months, and mediation is still underway. It is hoped that the case can be resolved amicably without going through legal channels, so the court has not set a date for continued hearings. It has been learned that Rock, the actor who played the lead role in the film, feels deeply uneasy after hearing about the matter in America. He has formally stated that when he played the role, he was purely motivated by interest and had no intention of insulting the Chinese. When the film was released in America, the Chinese community there did not point out any insults to the Chinese either. He did not expect that a misunderstanding would arise in Shanghai. He plans to write to the American Consulate in Shanghai for a detailed explanation to express his apology.</p>
<p>District Court Hearing</p>
<h3>Shandong Bandit Chief</h3>
<p>Hu Xiaozhong: Is He Really a Good Person?</p>
<p>Relying on Fellow Villagers from Linyi to Testify</p>
<p>Hu Xiaozhong, from Linyi, Shandong, was turned over to the Public Security Bureau last year in Shanghai's Fahua by Chen Qingtang, a fellow villager, who accused Hu of being a key member of the Shandong bandit Xie Liangcheng's gang. He allegedly led over 500 bandits on the night of August 25, 1928, to attack Chen's village, Nanquanzhuang, which is located ninety li from the city of Linyi, killing 143 men, women, and children, kidnapping 20 girls aged 15 to 20,陈的陈锡堂 was shot dead, 陈陈小娟 was raped unsuccessfully and then killed, and the houses were burned down. After the bandits were suppressed by the military, he fled to Shanghai. Due to the seriousness of the case, it was submitted to the Garrison Headquarters for review and then transferred to the District Court. The prosecutor completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Deng opened the court hearing. Hu Xiaozhong testified that he was 32 years old, from Linyi, and lived in Shanghai's Sanguantang as a laborer. He claimed to have only worked as a laborer for a little over ten days before being arrested. Before that, he served in the Third Brigade in Qingdao under Brigade Commander Deng Haifeng, Regiment Commander Zhao Xuehong (later known as Zhao Fengmin), and Battalion Commander Wang Youxiang, who were stationed in Zhucheng. He then claimed to have been a fireman. He said he joined the army in 1926 and served for four years. He denied all charges of robbery, murder, and arson, claiming that Chen Qingtang and others were selling private salt, and he had previously intercepted their private salt shipments several times between 1925 and 1927 while working as a clerk in a salt shop in his hometown, and that they were now falsely accusing him out of spite. The judge noted that his statements were contradictory and his testimony was inconsistent. He ordered photographs to be taken for correspondence to the battalion to verify whether he had served in the military between 1926 and 1929 in order to reach a verdict. The plaintiff, Chen Qingtang, testified that he was 32 years old, from Nanquanzhuang, Linyi, and worked as a laborer in Shanghai. He said that he was not at home when the disaster struck his family, but his brother, Chen Chou, was a captive at the time. The judge then summoned Chen Chou, who testified that he was 19 years old and recognized the defendant. On the night of August 25, 1928, at 10:00 PM, Hu led over 500 bandits to attack their village, which lasted until 8:00 AM on the 26th. His parents and sister-in-law were all kidnapped. His brother was shot dead when he tried to escape, and his niece was beaten to death when she refused to become his wife. He later escaped, and his parents were redeemed for ten yuan. Another victim, Dong Shihe, testified that he was from Nanquanzhuang, Linyi, and the defendant's aunt was his sister-in-law. On August 25, Hu led bandits to attack the village and killed his three nephews, Gouer, Shun'er, and Deng'er. Liu Qingchi, Liu Qingtang, and others testified that their homes were burned down, but their family members were not harmed. The judge instructed that if there were more fellow villagers who were victims, they should come forward to testify so that the truth could be clarified. The plaintiffs claimed that there were many people from the same village in Shanghai who could all come. The judge instructed them to gather together and submit a written statement for summoning. The case was adjourned for further hearing, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<p>Sheng Xuanhuai's Granddaughter Has Married</p>
<h3>Another Lawsuit Over Division of Property</h3>
<p>Wang Shengrong Sues Her Uncle Zechen</p>
<p>Demanding Division of Over 600,000</p>
<p>Lawsuits over the Sheng family's property in Biling have been occurring repeatedly. Now, Wang Shengrong, a granddaughter of Sheng Xuanhuai, has filed a lawsuit against her uncle, Sheng Zechen, and Zechen's son, Yuyou, also demanding a division of property. The late Aichen's two concubines, Gong and Zhang, have also been named as defendants. Sheng Zechen, Sheng Chongyi, Sheng Yuchang, and others have all come forward to participate as defendants, thus expanding the scope of the lawsuit. It is reported that Sheng Xuanhuai's first wife was Dong, and both Kui and Ai were born to Dong. The second wife was Zhuang. The plaintiff in this case, Rong, is the daughter of Kui and was adopted by Ai. Since Ai's children were all gone, Rong served Ai's two concubines, Gong and Zhang, with filial piety, and is naturally Ai's adopted daughter. Although Yuyou is the son of Zechen and has inherited Ai's lineage, Ai's estate, Madam Zhuang's private property, and the Yuzhai Charity Estate are all jointly owned by her and Yuyou, so she hired lawyer Li Zuyu to file a lawsuit against Ai's two concubines, Zechen, and his son, requesting a division of their assets totaling over 600,000. Zechen and Yuyou, who were sued, also hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Jiang Baoli to defend themselves, claiming that the plaintiff was actually the daughter of the eldest son, Kui, and since Ai had no children, Yuyou, the son of the fourth son, Zechen, was adopted, which is completely legal. There is no such thing as establishing an adopted daughter in addition to an adopted son. The plaintiff's claim that Ai adopted the plaintiff in 1916 because he had no son is illogical. Even if she believes that she has the right to jointly divide 60% of the Yuzhai Charity Estate, the plaintiff can only claim that the property under the name of the eldest son, Kui, has no identity or name in the third room, so how can she fabricate facts to request a division? They requested that the original lawsuit be rejected. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenyong opened the court. Both parties were represented by lawyers, and other participants also appointed lawyers to appear in court. After mutual arguments, the case was temporarily adjourned for review because the case was complex and required the plaintiff to provide a detailed statement of reasons.</p>
<h3>A Licentious Son-in-Law</h3>
<p>Seduces His Wife's Sister and Then Her Younger Sister</p>
<p>The Older Sister's Husband Becomes His Own Husband</p>
<p>Wang Nenghai, from Wusong, lives at No. 2 Baisazhong Road, in the French Concession. His daughter, Wang Shuzhen, is in her early twenties and has a beautiful appearance. She lost her mother at a young age and was raised by her father. She and her younger sister are unmarried. Recently, due to the opening of her romantic senses, she often visited her sister's husband, Chen Guitang, under the pretext of visiting her sister, and ended up developing a romantic relationship with Chen Guitang. Their love reached a boiling point. When her father, Wang Nenghai, found out, he took his daughter back and reprimanded her. However, Shuzhen actually ran away and started a new family with Chen Guitang, behaving like a married couple. After her father found out where she was, he reported it to the French police, who ordered an investigation and arrested Chen and Shuzhen together, taking them into custody. The couple tasted the flavor of a prison cell. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the French Court for questioning. First, the complainant, the girl's father, Wang Nenghai, stated that he lived on Youheng Road, Hongkou. His eldest daughter was seduced by the defendant, Chen Guitang, at the age of seventeen. Later, relatives mediated and formally married her to him as his wife. However, the complainant knew that his son-in-law was a licentious playboy and was afraid that he would seduce his second daughter, so he moved to a remote area at No. 2 Baisazhong Road, under his jurisdiction. Unexpectedly, Chen Guitang dared to take advantage of the complainant's absence on business trips to deceive and occupy his second daughter, Shuzhen. However, Chen's financial resources are limited and he is unable to take care of his wife, so how can he possibly support the younger sister? He requested that he be severely punished according to the law. As for the second daughter, Shuzhen, he requested that she be sent to the bureau because the complainant is away on business most of the time, and if he takes her back, she might be abducted again. Chen Guitang testified that he was a businessman in other cities. In August of last year, he left for business and returned to Shanghai in November. He learned that his wife was having an affair, so there were often disagreements in the family. His sister-in-law, Wang Shuzhen, often came to mediate, and day after day, the two of them went from friendship to love. When her father found out, he beat Shuzhen, so Shuzhen ran away and started a new family with him, which is true. Wang Shuzhen testified that last year, because her sister was having an affair, she had an argument with her brother-in-law. As a girl, she often went to mediate. Later, she saw that her brother-in-law treated her sister very well, so she developed a love for her brother-in-law. Now, she is willing to spend her life with her brother-in-law and does not want to go home. Although her father is her biological father, he often abused her, and she is afraid of him. Now that she is in her early twenties, according to the laws of the Republic of China, she should have the right to choose her own marriage. She requested that she be granted freedom and that the lawsuit be dismissed. Judge Zhu Chengshen consulted with the French Consul, Mr. Du, and ordered Chen to be released on bail and Wang Shuzhen to be detained while the police investigate whether Wang Shuzhen is over twenty years old and report back to the court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>A Page of a Young Girl's Painful History</h3>
<p>One Wrong Step Leads to Eternal Regret</p>
<p>Chen Yuemei, a woman of 24 years old from Guanyintang, Qingpu, lost both parents at a young age and was raised by her aunt, Li. Last autumn, she came to Xujiahui with a woman named Xu to learn lace making, and soon became a Catholic in the Catholic Church. In early February of this year, she was enticed by the rogue Yang Jinlong, and Yuemei was bewitched by him, so they formed a small family and lived together as a couple at No. 33 Qian Hu's House. In the beginning, they were still considered to be on good terms, but Yang associated with bandits and liked to gamble. He swindled all the lace wages obtained by Yuemei, and then pawned off her clothes and gold jewelry. Recently, he has ignored the family, and they are almost starving. When Yuemei asked him for money, she was beaten. Unexpectedly, Yang came the other day and claimed that if she wanted money, she could follow him. Yuemei had no choice but to follow Yang to the home of his mistress, Yang Shen, at No. 5 Xichengzhi Lane, Tangjie. He locked Yuemei in a room, surrounded her, and beat her until she was covered in injuries and her body was not intact. He also threatened to end her life with a pistol. Fortunately, a neighbor heard the noise and came to rescue her, so she was able to save her life. After Yuemei escaped, she went to the Sixth District, Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau in the town and requested an arrest. The police immediately dispatched officers to summon Yang Jinlong and Yang Shen to the station. After Chief Xu briefly interrogated them, Chen Yuemei testified that she had been enticed to a hotel by Yang Jinlong in February and was raped against her will under various threats. Her injustice was unpardonable for the rest of her life, and the defendant was a well-known local rogue with a large following, so she was afraid that her life would be difficult to protect in the future and that she could not face her parents in the afterlife. Therefore, she wished to break off all contact with him, ask for the return of the borrowed money, and go home to live. She pleaded to be tried for rape, and tears streamed down her face as she spoke. Yang Jinlong testified that he was 36 years old, from Kunshan, and worked as a telephone operator at the Nanyang University Telephone Office. He admitted to having an affair with Chen Yuemei and admitted to the beating. Chief Xu believed that the case involved enticement and rape and was inconvenient to handle, so he sent Chen Yuemei, Yang Jinlong, and Yang Shen to the District Court yesterday morning for strict handling according to the law.</p>
<h3>Trial Record of a Madman Murder Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiazhen Describes the Circumstances of the Murder</p>
<p>Zhang Jiazhen, a madman, killed a young woman, Wu Zhou, and a primary school student, Leng Cuibao, with a knife in front of the Qunxue Society at Xiaonanmen in March of this year. After being arrested by the patrol police, he was sent to a mental hospital. His mental state has gradually recovered, and the District Court has completed its investigation and filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Zhao opened the court hearing. Zhang Jiazhen testified that he was from Zhenjiang, and the knife was bought for ten cents by a Mr. Wang. He bought two knives, one for himself and one for Mr. Wang, who had already gone to Nanjing. He bought the knife not to kill people, but to sell beef. He didn't know what he was doing when he killed people. He hadn't bumped into the woman who was killed. Heaven told him to kill her. He had no grudges against the deceased. He wasn't lying. The child was watching him and was killed by him. There was also a child who hadn't died. He didn't know them either. Now he thinks about it, and he feels sad. He didn't kill the patrol police because he was going to shoot, so he scared him with a knife. He was willing to go to the police station and didn't want to escape. The judge asked, "Do you know that killing people is punishable by death?" He replied, "Heaven told me to kill them, so it's not my fault." The judge asked, "Are you willing to pay with your life?" Zhang couldn't answer. The judge asked, "Is there anyone who sold you out for pretending to be crazy and killing people?" He replied, "I want to pretend to be crazy. There is heaven and earth above and a beast below." The judge asked, "Why didn't you kill the other woman?" He replied, "She ran away." Witness He Jiumei testified that she was 21 years old, from Shanghai, and lived in Xiaonanmen. She and Wu Zhou were working in the factory. She saw Zhang Jiazhen grabbing Wu Zhou in Tianfuli. When she saw the knife, she immediately ran away, so she didn't know what happened after she was stabbed in the hand. The judge asked, "Did a young woman in your landlord Gong Xuexian's family ever have an argument with him?" She replied, "No." Leng Chuibao testified that he was 21 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived at No. 44 Meijialong as a teacher. His brother, Cuibao, was killed by Zhang Jiazhen after leaving school and died in the hospital. He didn't witness it at the time. Fan Zhang testified that she was 37 years old, from Zhenjiang, and lived at Tashuiqiao. Her husband's name was Fan Zhusheng, and he sold newspapers. Zhang Jiazhen was her younger brother. He had come to her house twice this year and didn't call out to her. He just played with her two sons. She didn't invite him because there were many people in her house. He had been mentally ill when he was twelve or thirteen years old, but he recovered soon after. He hadn't been mentally ill for three years since coming to Shanghai, but his words were a little off. She didn't know he lived in Ma Tianxing Lane until the Third Branch of the First District told her after he killed someone. The judge believed that there were discrepancies in the sentencing of this case, so he ordered that the witnesses be subpoenaed again for verification. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The National Sugar Manufacturing Company was operated by the Yizhong Banking Syndicate on behalf of the former National Sugar Factory in 1926 to compensate for outstanding debts. The planning and management were initially smooth, but the labor unrest and disputes caused by the political changes in the spring of 1927 were not resolved for a long time, resulting in huge losses and eventually leading to a shutdown. Last year, in order to protect the shareholders' capital and maintain the industry, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent personnel to organize a reorganization office to test-produce 10,000 tons of refined sugar in preparation for resuming operations. Now that the test production has been completed, the Ministry has ordered the reorganization office to return all the equipment to the Yizhong Banking Syndicate to facilitate the resumption of operations. It is reported that the Banking Syndicate has raised a large amount of capital and is making arrangements to proceed. Both parties have sent responsible personnel to the factory to carry out the handover since the day before yesterday. The Banking Syndicate has specially invited Lao Naixin to represent them in handling the takeover.</p>

<h3>An Elderly Man Commits Suicide After Losing His Grandson</h3>
<p>Hu Sanlin, a 61-year-old man from Gaoyou, used to pull a rickshaw. Recently, due to his old age, he shared a shift with another person (called a half-shift). His 60-year-old wife washed clothes for others, and his grandson, Heshang, 13 years old, rented a loft above the stove at No. 548 Fushou Lane, Jiaxing Road, Hongkou, to make a meager living. Heshang studied diligently and intelligently at a nearby private school. On the first day of this month, because of the abolished Lunar New Year Dragon Boat Festival holiday, Heshang went out to play after eating and did not return until late. The old couple searched everywhere in great anxiety. There was still no sign of him yesterday morning. Sanlin, feeling hopeless after his beloved grandson disappeared, suddenly embraced the idea of ending his life. He secretly swallowed opium to commit suicide in bed, sighing. His wife thought he was sleeping and didn't pay attention. When she called him for lunch and he didn't respond, she went to the bed and realized something was wrong. The landlord from Guangdong, Mr. Liang, heard the noise and came to see. He determined that he had taken poison and immediately sent him to the Gongji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, although the time of taking the poison was short, it was difficult to save his life due to his old age.</p>

Then, the meeting resolved to proceed with election procedures as follows: (1) It was decided to convene a members' general meeting on June 20th at the Ningbo Association Hall, and an announcement would be published in newspapers for two days to inform the industry. (2) It was resolved that the membership applications submitted by industry members were now complete and that a membership list should be compiled according to the reorganization procedures and submitted to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau for guidance and supervision of the election by representatives of the Reorganization Committee. (3) Upon receiving a letter from the Reorganization Committee setting a date for the Industry Representatives Conference and requesting the nomination of representatives to attend, it was resolved that the Reorganization Committee would nominate Committee Member Chen Liangyu as the association's representative.  Membership dues would be paid according to regulations.

It was resolved to designate a special committee to assess sale prices in detail and publish them for all industry members to comply with.  Any violations of the regulations would be subject to disciplinary action. This price list would be distributed twice a month.  Any fluctuations within the period would be announced separately and at any time. (5) It was noted that the assistance fees allocated from the license tax on opium in the Second District to the northern and southern cities were long overdue. The association urgently needed to collect these funds to cover the costs of holding the elections. It was resolved to investigate the matter and send a formal letter of demand. (6) Committee Member Shen Qixiang proposed that the market expenses previously determined by the association should be collected from July 1st of this year, after the establishment of the general membership meeting, to maintain the association's affairs (Passed). (7) Committee Member Chen Liangyu proposed that all funds received by the association in the future should be deposited and withdrawn from designated banks at any time, and that three economic committee members should be designated to be responsible for safekeeping.

<h3>Sues for Divorce Due to Husband's Abandonment</h3>
<p>Fu Xia, a woman from Yancheng, has retained attorney Zhang Ding to file a lawsuit with the District Court, alleging that her husband, Fu Longchang, abandoned her and seeking a divorce.  The petition states that she married the defendant in September of the thirteenth year of the Republic through a matchmaker.  However, he indulged in debauchery and neglected his duties, disregarding their livelihood.  She was forced to work in a factory as a female worker to make a living.  The defendant not only failed to improve himself but squandered her wages. When he did not get his way, he would resort to physical violence. On October 31st of last year, while the plaintiff was at the factory, he took all her clothes and belongings and disappeared. After a long time, she inquired with his parents, but they ignored her. She advertised in the newspaper in January of this year, hoping for an early reunion, but he callously abandoned her and never returned home.  Later, she learned that the defendant was at the Yong'an Company's Beijing opera theatre on April 6th, so she went to see him but was violently beaten and taken to the Nanjing Road police station. Because the case involved civil matters, she was instructed to file a lawsuit in court. The defendant has abandoned her for many years, and when she sought him out, she was beaten.  The affection and righteousness between them are broken, and it is difficult to grow old together. Therefore, she requests permission to divorce. The defendant also submitted a defense, accusing the plaintiff of adultery with her maternal uncle, Zeng Changtai. Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shengli specially opened the Fourth Court for trial. First, the plaintiff stated the previous situation. The court ordered Zeng Changtai to appear in court. He stated that he was 32 years old, from Yancheng, residing on Guoqing Road, and currently working at a certain amusement park. He was asked if he and Fu Xia were at Yong'an Company together. He replied that this was not the case and that he did not have time to play due to his work. He was asked if there was a Liu Xiaoxizi who seduced the plaintiff in the past, and if he negotiated at the scene afterward. He replied that he did. The court ordered the defendant, Fu Longchang, to appear in court. He testified that he pulls a cart for a living and does not want a divorce. Last year, on March 23rd, his wife was abducted by Liu Xiaoxizi, and he filed a lawsuit to bring his wife back. Unexpectedly, people told him that his maternal uncle, Zeng Changtai, was having an affair with his wife. He did not believe it until he returned home on September 27th of last year and caught them in the act. On the evening of April 6th this year, at 11:00 PM, someone informed him that his maternal uncle and his wife were playing at Yong'an Company, so he went there and grabbed his maternal uncle but was beaten and escaped. At that time, he took his wife to the police station and now asks the court for justice. The judge questioned Zeng Changtai again. He stated that these were all false accusations by Longchang, and that it was inappropriate for him, as an elder, to commit adultery with his nephew's wife. Because Longchang was usually unproductive, he would often educate him, which inevitably caused resentment. After that, he generally did not inquire about Longchang's family affairs. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant had accused the plaintiff and Zeng of adultery in the Procuratorate of this court, which was found not to be true. Furthermore, the plaintiff stated that the defendant was always unproductive, using lead coins and gambling, ruining her reputation, and shamelessly accusing her of adultery with her uncle. The neighbors are still there, and if there is any impropriety, they can be severely punished. The judge then invited Prosecutor Xu to appear in court and express his opinion. The plaintiff's lawyer then made a statement. The judge then announced that the debate was over and a verdict would be issued at 1:00 PM on the 7th of this month, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Woman Sues to Dissolve Engagement</h3>
<p>Fiancé Wants Ten Times the Betrothal Gift</p>
<p>Ling Awu, a local woman residing at No. 38, Xiangyi Lane, Gonghexin Road, Zhabei, recently retained attorney Gong Yingxuan to sue her fiancé, Zhao Jiansheng, in the District Court, alleging that he has no legitimate occupation and that she did not consent to the engagement. The case was heard by Judge Guo yesterday. First, the plaintiff, Ling Awu, testified that she was 24 years old and from Shanghai. When she was eight years old, her father betrothed her to the defendant. The defendant has never had a job. Furthermore, she was only eight years old when the engagement was made, so the engagement without her consent should be dissolved. Ling Wang, 55 years old, testified that Ling Awu is her daughter and that the engagement was entirely decided by her late husband. She agreed that her daughter requested termination of the engagement. The defendant, Zhao Jiansheng, testified that he was 25 years old, lived in Zhaojiazhai, West End, Pengpu Township, and worked for a living. The judge said, "How about the plaintiff return some money to you, and you remarry? Besides, marrying a wife who does not agree will never end well." The defendant replied that when the engagement was made, fifty yuan was given as a betrothal gift. If the plaintiff wants to terminate the engagement, she must pay ten times the penalty, five hundred yuan, before he will agree to terminate the engagement. The judge said, "How can that be? If you borrow money, the interest cannot exceed the principal. It is best to return the principal and interest. It is best to reconcile. There is no benefit in fighting a lawsuit. How much money will you spend after three trials? What benefits will you have?" The plaintiff interrupted and said, "There were only thirty-two yuan of betrothal gift when the engagement was made. Even if you double it, it is only sixty-four yuan." The matchmakers Ling Gengxin and Ling Yan also testified. The judge tried to reconcile them, but they did not agree, so he began the debate and considered it concluded, awaiting the verdict.</p>
<h3>Looted Fishing Boat Redeemed After Payment</h3>
<p>The Ningbo fishing boat "Jindeli," loaded with fresh yellow croaker for sale in Shanghai, arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 19th of last month and berthed on the Pudong beach opposite the Jianghai Customs House in Wusong River, near the "Cedian" and "Junhe" warships. That night, it was stormed by Wen-Tai pirates who entered the port of Wusong and looted the fishing boat. The fish merchant Xie Alai confirmed the robbery and reported it to the Fourth District Water Police for pursuit, and requested the Jiangzhe Fisheries Association to send the "Fuhai" escort vessel to track and rescue it. Details were reported in the 23rd of last month. It is now learned that after the fishing boat was robbed, the pirates forced it to sail to Haimen, Taizhou, and communicated with the fish merchant Xie Alai, requesting him to prepare funds for ransom. After receiving the letter, the fish merchant immediately sent someone to negotiate with the pirates. It was agreed to redeem the boat for 800 yuan, and the payment has been completed. The fishing boat can now escape danger and will sail to Shanghai soon. However, according to the Zhejiang Public Association, the loss from the robbery to date is more than a thousand yuan.</p>

Fortunately, it was daytime, and they were rescued by boatmen, so no one was injured. The customs and river police learned of the incident and tried to tow the lighter into the port, but the wind and waves were too strong, making it difficult to tow. They are now trying to find a way to tow and salvage it.</p>

A tram number 41, driven by a driver from the French Tramway Company, number 149, came by. Zhang rushed across the road in front of the tram and was knocked down, suffering a head injury and bleeding profusely. Police officers found him, recorded the number, and sent the injured person and the tram to Renji Hospital. He died from his injuries shortly after arriving at the hospital.

<h3>Be Careful When Russians Inquire</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reported that recently, two well-dressed Russians have been frequenting foreign firms, shops, and offices. One asks questions as a pretext, while the other steals in the meantime. As the weather gets warmer, those wearing Western suits tend to remove their coats and hang them on hooks. These people take the opportunity to steal valuables from the coat pockets. On April 30th, No. 17 Museum Road, and yesterday (May 3rd), No. 21 Yuanmingyuan Road were successively robbed. In one case, one Russian pretended to inquire about the address of a certain foreign firm. The owner flipped through the directory for him, unaware that the wallet in his pocket had already been taken by the second Russian, resulting in a loss of 150 yuan. From now on, anyone who removes their coat should pay attention to these people.</p>

<p>Incoming Correspondence</p>
<h3>Letter from China and Foreign Telephone Company to Shareholders</h3>
<p>Letter from Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company Limited to shareholders: Esteemed Shareholders, The declaration issued on April 26th was not entirely clear. The directors can now inform the shareholders that the report of the advisory committee has been received. The report indicates that the directors share the same views regarding the company's adoption of an automatic telephone system (as detailed in the aforementioned declaration). As the directors fully agree with the advisory committee, they specifically recommend that the shareholders accept the tender from International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation so that the matters discussed in the report of the Public Works Department Commissioner can be implemented immediately and the highest quality automatic telephone service can be provided to the public in Shanghai without delay. For the complete understanding of all shareholders, the following documents are included in this booklet: (1) Report of the Advisory Committee, (2) Tender of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation, (3) Tender of Ericson Telephone Company Limited, (4) Tender of Telegraph and Telephone Trust Limited. The decision to recommend accepting the tender of International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation is based on the fact that the directors have carefully considered this matter and have been advised by experts who have no interest in any particular system. As for the financial aspect, the directors believe that the price of 75 taels per share is quite fair, considering that the face value is only 50 taels and that the market price was only 65 taels and 5 qian at the time of the initial tender. The directors believe that the amount of profit that will be generated from the requested capital in the future is also reasonable, as it is still less than that of most other public utilities in Shanghai. Therefore, the directors hope that the shareholders will support their recommendation to sell the company's business to the new company organized by International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. The report of the advisory committee and the tenders of the three companies have been submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, requesting their approval to grant the patent to International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation. Once a written reply of approval is received, an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders will be convened. You will be notified of the date as soon as possible. With best wishes. Sincerely, Bell, Acting Chairman on behalf of the Board of Directors (May 28, 1930)</p>
<p>Letter</p>
<p>Dear Editor, The report in your newspaper's local news section about the Punam Group Police continuing to break up a bandit den not only contained inaccurate details, but also misrepresented the names of the people involved. I respectfully submit the true situation for publication in your newspaper to establish the facts. On May 7th, the kidnap victim Zhang Yuxing escaped from the bandit den and reported to Ye Yuyu and the Songjiang County Government. Upon receiving the report, Ye Yuyu, together with Deputy Township Head Ma Heshu, the local security officer Zhang Jingfang, and many villagers, raided the bandit den and captured the kidnappers Gu Guanlian (previously misidentified as Gu Liansheng) and Wang Jinyi, as well as the kidnap victim Zhang Zhujiang. The two bandits were sent to the Qiantang Harbor Ninth Precinct as an agent for the Nanhui County Government for legal action. The kidnap victim Zhang Zhujiang, due to his old age and prolonged confinement, requested to stay at the local security officer's home for one night. The next day, he filed a report with the county government. However, at 3:00 AM on the 8th, Zhang Yuxing, accompanied by Captain Shi of the Jiangsu Water Police, came with an official document from the Songjiang County Government to raid the bandit den. However, the bandits had already been transferred, and the kidnap victim had been rescued. Captain Shi took the kidnap victims Zhang Zhujiang and Zhang Yuxing to the Songjiang County Government for questioning and then released them. On the 10th, Inspector Shao Jingzhi of the Ninth Precinct, accompanied by Detective Yao, who was dispatched by Director Fang of the Nanhui County Public Security Bureau, hurriedly came to the township and insisted on taking the kidnap victim. We explained the situation in detail. They were furious and arrested Deputy Security Officer Luo Hongpu without raiding the bandit den. We had no choice but to go to Songjiang to ask the Songjiang County Government to return the kidnap victim Zhang Yuxing to Nanhui for filing a report and requesting the release of Hongpu. At this time, the County Public Security Bureau had no choice but to send the kidnappers to the County Government for legal action. However, Deputy Security Officer Luo Hongpu was still detained without release. After being imprisoned for four days, Zhang Yuxing was finally able to report to the Nanhui County Government, and Luo Hongpu was released after questioning. Currently, the kidnappers and kidnap victims have all been taken by Captain Shi to Songjiang for legal action. Ye Yuyu, Ma Heshu, Zhang Jingfang respectfully submit. Having read the news article "Prices of Livestock Intestines Continue to Rise" in the June 3rd issue of your newspaper, I am greatly astonished by the references to our factory. After investigation, our factory has not established branch factories in northern Anhui or southern Henan. The statement that "the stock in Shanghai is low, and there is no supply for the market" is contrary to the facts. Therefore, I request that you make a correction to avoid confusing the market. Sincerely, Guo Shunji</p>

<p>The idea for the World Grain Exhibition Conference began three or four years ago, and by 1928, it had gradually matured. Canadian Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Motherwell, convened a representative conference, which unanimously decided to prepare for the general assembly. The aim is to bring together agricultural authorities from around the world, especially those specializing in grain, to exchange ideas and discuss various related issues. At the same time, it will collect and exhibit grains from around the world for a friendly and open competition.</p>
<p>Regina is located in the heart of Canada's largest agricultural region, and 1932 marks the 50th anniversary of the first farmer settlements in Western Canada. This anniversary will also be celebrated, making it an ideal location and time for the conference.</p>
<p>After the plan was announced, it received support and praise from all sides. Canadian Prime Minister King stated, "This undertaking has global implications. Canada, as one of the world's largest grain producers, with millions of acres of land yet to be developed, feels the need to hold a world conference to discuss these issues." Minister of Agriculture Motherwell said, "This conference can encourage interest in improving grain quality and disseminate knowledge about improving general agricultural conditions, with extraordinary potential." Many Canadian newspapers also praised it, such as "Agricultural Report," which said, "This can be a powerful advertisement for our Canada and Canadian products to the world, while also focusing domestic attention on grain fields, which are the foundation of Canadian agriculture."</p>
<p>The conference will be chaired by the Governor-General of Canada, Viscount Willingdon. The Canadian federal government, provincial governments, and national public organizations are all providing support. The Canadian government has sent invitations to countries around the world, inviting them to send representatives and exhibits to participate in the conference. Although the conference date is still two years away, due to the broad scope and the time required for preparation, the Canadian government is actively preparing in all areas. The conference content is divided into two parts: exhibition and conference. There are no restrictions on the year in which the exhibited agricultural products were grown, but preference is given to those grown in 1930 and 1931, as all exhibits must be transported to the venue before March 1, 1932. On the conference side, in order to obtain the best possible results, it is quite difficult to solicit opinions from all parties and draft proposals.</p>
<p>The various detailed rules for managing the exhibition and conference are still being drafted, but the outline has been agreed upon. Generally, the right to send exhibits to the conference for display is granted to agriculturalists from anywhere in the world. Each agriculturalist can register as many types of crops as they have, without restriction, but only one registration can be made for each type. There is no limit on the year in which each exhibit was grown. The registration fee for each type is two dollars if the total value of the exhibit is two thousand dollars or less, and five dollars if the total value exceeds two thousand dollars. Each exhibit must genuinely be the product of the exhibitor and grown under cultivated conditions.</p>
<p>To facilitate the transportation of exhibits, Regina will be declared a port of entry.</p>
<p>The prize money (cash) for competitions in wheat, barley, corn, rye, buckwheat, millet, beans, hemp, sunflowers, radishes, etc., that has already been proposed exceeds 200,500 dollars (equivalent to over 50,000 pounds). The exhibits are divided into 19 categories, further subdivided into 55 classes, with a total of 1,600 prizes ranging from 2,500 dollars to 10 dollars.</p>
<p>Mr. Newman, a grain expert from the Canadian government, serves as the chairman of the prize committee. Other judges are selected from world-renowned experts.</p>
<p>The purpose of exhibiting the products is to demonstrate the progress made in the production and promotion of various agricultural crops through education, exploration, and economic research. The committee of each exhibiting country can freely decide the best way to display each exhibit from a national perspective.</p>
<p>Each country's exhibit can have a free area of 15 feet square. Outside of this area, there is a charge of five dollars for every five feet of frontage. Arrangements for the venue layout must be made with the exhibition authorities as early as possible. A small area will also be opened in the venue for commercial exhibitions. For details, please write to the organizing secretary.</p>
<p>In addition to the exhibition section, the conference section is also very important. Agricultural experts from all countries, whether practical or scientific, are invited to participate in the hope that this conference will become a clearinghouse for the best ideas and knowledge in agriculture worldwide.</p>
<p>To facilitate discussion, the conference will be divided into several sections, meeting in the mornings of each exhibition day. Lantern slides and films will be prepared in English and French as the official languages, and skilled interpreters will be available. The topics for discussion are divided into six categories:</p>
<p>(A) Agriculture</p>
<p>Soils (including physics, chemistry, and mycology)</p>
<p>Cultivation methods, fertilizers, weeds, plant growth and development, experimental methods, seed production and registration, irrigation</p>
<p>(B) Pests and Diseases</p>
<p>(C) Economics (including promotion)</p>
<p>Farm management and costs, grading, sales and investment, storage and transportation, world markets</p>
<p>(D) Milling and Baking</p>
<p>(E) Agricultural Machinery</p>
<p>Cleaning, cultivation, harvesting</p>
<p>(F) General</p>
<p>If national committees have suggestions, they can be submitted at the conference. All proposals and documents will be printed in both English and French and distributed to the representatives before each meeting. Therefore, all proposals must be submitted to the conference executive department before January 1, 1932.</p>
<p>In the future, after the conference, all documents, speeches, and records will be printed into a formal report and distributed to those in all countries who are concerned about agriculture for reference.</p>
<h3>Tenth World Summer Peake</h3>
<p>United States Actively Preparing</p>
<p>Special on "Summer Peake Village"</p>
<p>The Second World Summer Peake has been decided to be held in Los Angeles, USA, in 1932. The US Organizing Committee is actively preparing. The US began submitting a request to the World Summer Peake Committee in 1920 to hold the next session in Los Angeles. Currently, the Los Angeles Organizing Committee's office displays a petition from each of the three presidents, Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover. According to the Organizing Committee's announcement, a special "Summer Peake Village" will be set up around the main sports field for the rest of the athletes from various countries. In order to attract spectators, various promotional brochures are being printed.</p>
<h3>Nine-Foot-Long Fish Wing Bone</h3>
<p>The Xiamen Jimei Advanced Aquatic and Maritime School's training ship, Jimei No. 2, entered the port yesterday morning and obtained a large fish wing bone in the Langgang waters of the East Sea. It is about nine feet long and two feet high. It is said that the captain intends to send it to St. John's University for Mr. Zhu Yuanding, a Master of Biology, to study and determine what kind of giant fish's remains it is.</p>
<h3>Export Amount of Rapeseed to Japan</h3>
<p>Approximately 200,000 Dan This Year</p>
<p>Wuhu News: Wuhu's rapeseed production this year is approximately 350,000 dan, of which approximately 200,000 dan are exported to Japan. They are being shipped out one after another. The market price for medium-quality goods is between 50 and 70 cents. June and July futures are at 6.2 taels.</p>
<h3>Two German Oriental Scholars</h3>
<p>Died Simultaneously</p>
<p>Discoverers and Translators of the Turpan Script</p>
<p>Professor Albest von Le Coq and Professor F. W. K. Mueller, famous German oriental scholars, known in academic circles for jointly discovering the Turpan script, suddenly passed away in Berlin within minutes of each other. Those who heard the news were deeply saddened.</p>
<p>Professor Le Coq's reputation began with the success of his Turpan (in Central Asia) expedition. As a result of this expedition, the professor announced to the world the discovery of the remains of an ancient civilization, proving the existence of a link between ancient Greek, Persian, Indian, and Chinese cultures. This discovery is one of the most important discoveries of modern times and is highly relevant to antiquarian exploration. The professor brought the discovered texts and paintings to India, endured many hardships, crossed many high mountains in Central Asia, some of which were 15,000 feet above sea level, and finally arrived in Berlin. The discovered paintings are treasured in the Museum of Anthropology. The professor has written many accounts of his discovery, the most important of which is "Ancient Buddhist Art in Central Asia," a magnificent work in four volumes.</p>
<p>Professor Mueller served as the Director of the Oriental Department of the Berlin Museum of Anthropology for many years and was an authority on Oriental languages and cultures. His exploration area can be said to extend from Syria to Japan, from Japan to the South Pacific Islands, and from the South Pacific Islands back to Syria. He translated Samoan texts, compiled collections of Malay art, and spent many years translating Siamese texts into Western languages. In his later years, he specialized in the study of Chinese and Japanese characters. When Professor Le Coq brought the discovered Turpan documents back to Berlin, he immediately used his knowledge to study the reading of the Turpan script. Therefore, although the credit for the discovery belongs to Le Coq, the credit for the translation belongs to Mueller.</p>
<p>Before the deaths of Professors Le Coq and Mueller, Professor Wilhelm, the Director of the Chinese Cultural Institute in Frankfurt, also passed away. This is a major blow to Oriental studies in Germany. The successor to Professor Wilhelm has not yet been decided and is currently being handled by Mr. Schüler, who is also organizing his posthumous works.</p>

<h3>The Story of World Literature (1)(6)(6) by John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 42: 19th Century Russian Literature</p>
<p>Turgenev's novels are complete and restrained, while the more intense and unrestrained passions of Fyodor Dostoevsky pour out from within him and do not enter into any model beyond the realm of lawless and irregular facts. In his youth, he was arrested and sent to Siberia for four years for revolutionary activities (which barely went beyond lecturing). His bitter experience was turned into a story in "Memoirs from the House of the Dead." That iron-like experience entered his soul, and he became a sad man for life. However, along with his suffering, and perhaps as a result of it, came a great compassion for all who suffer, for criminals and vagrants, for "the insulted and injured people," as one of his novels is called. His most beautiful work, "Crime and Punishment," is a terrifyingly profound thing. Raskolnikov, a poor student, commits a brutal murder. The motive is not ordinary motives such as jealousy, revenge, or robbery, but the complexities of morbid egoism and resentment towards life. He confesses to his lover, Sonya, a miserable street girl, and she urges him to atone for his sins. He surrenders to the police and is sent to Siberia. Sonya later goes there to follow him. Her dedication is in his atonement. In the suffering of these two children, Dostoevsky, who is not a symbolist, sees all of Russia and dreams of a future in which all of Russia and the world are redeemed by love. He does not believe that the way to cure oppression is violence. In "Demons," he shows the folly and tragedy of revolutionary conspiracy. He believes that the peasants are the hope of Russia, endowing them with virtues that Maxim Gorky now tells us were only the literary and political ideals of that era.</p>
<p>The sorrow of life that flows through all of Dostoevsky's novels is often misunderstood by Western readers as morbid, as limited to humanity having some kind of unhealthy motive. This is morbid, but even so, the novelist should not be blamed any more than a journalist should be blamed for reporting murder cases, fires, abductions on the front page of the newspaper, and also reporting beautiful articles of human courage, such as the death of a polar flight or a surgeon who sacrificed his life in an effort to seek help for several of his compatriots. This is not to say that Dostoevsky took materials from the news; he took materials from universal life. His greatest novel, "The Brothers Karamazov," deals with the questions of good and evil that appear in the weaknesses and difficulties of all unimportant people. There is no "protagonist" in the whole of Dostoevsky, and the heroines are not made for the movies. They are too sad, too tragic, too real. The only thing lacking in Dostoevsky's genius is a sense of humor. Turgenev has it, with a rather pale philosophical and sympathetic nature. Tolstoy, the greatest of them, only has serious and tortuous humor, only smiling and no laughter. There is not much comic relief in Russian literature between Gogol and Chekhov.</p>
<p>Russians are often difficult to understand, but no more difficult than understanding the rest of humanity. Some people think that the Slavic temperament, which is mistakenly called "psychological," can be seen in our close neighbors. In this regard, Dostoevsky's first novel, "Poor Folk," seems to have a strong flavor of Dickens, whose works he actually hardly knew, which is very meaningful. This is a small, round world, but Dostoevsky thought that the alienation of his own people and his own literature from Europe was shown in his wonderful comments on Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina," saying that it was the Russian capital investing a great thing in the ability to solve the problems that oppress humanity. This is the clearest evidence that Russia can offer to the Western world. The problems that oppress humanity have not been solved by novels, whether in the East or the West. The same is true of the problems of human nature, which are suggested and revealed by novels, but not solved. What comes to us from Russia through Dostoevsky is the ability to convey and evoke emotions, such as in "The Brothers Karamazov," and to press interest into the scattered, small, and rather solid fundamental materials. He was not known in England and America until at least the names of Turgenev and Tolstoy were heard. His strong nationalism hindered him at the border, but his humanitarian spirit eventually triumphed among at least conscious people in all countries. Now Dostoevsky is one of the universally recognized great masters of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Russian novelists carry the weight of the world on their shoulders. We cannot say whether that burden has enhanced them as artists. Suffice it to say that they are powerful, their art is noble and honest. When Tolstoy died in 1910, he was the most outstanding writer in the world. If he were just a novelist, he would not have been so universally respected. If he had not been a novelist, his identity as a reformer and fighter for freedom would not have been so lofty. There have been many writers who bravely used their pens, their humanity, and their souls in non-literary struggles, such as Milton and Hugo, some of whom sacrificed their energy for "isms" or occasionally put aside their art, and some who, like Byron, abandoned the pen and took up the sword. Tolstoy was probably the only artist of first-rate creativity who tried to deny and suppress his art as a demon or irrelevant thing for his higher purposes. Fortunately, those purposes did not completely occupy his heart until his creative impulses had already been expressed in his novels and stories. In his youth, he was a hereditary aristocrat and soldier, and was hereditary not in nature but in outward affairs. His experiences in the Crimean War provided material for "Sevastopol" and other war stories. Those works immediately brought him fame and established his literary career. The nature of those works, the masters of those works, were, as he himself said, true and without false exaggeration or sentimental traces of glory. He saw war as it really was, as a terrible and useless thing in which people displayed simple, blind courage. At that time, he was neither a pacifist nor a propagandist. In fact, the emperor ordered him to retreat from the dangerous area. Even after his fame was resounding and certain, he was more interested in people and things than in literature, and that was the source of his power. He spent his time in the countryside on the manor, striving to educate the village children and improve the conditions of the farmers. In the midst of many activities, he wrote his two great novels, "War and Peace" and "Anna Karenina."</p>

<p>Peicheng Girls to</p>
<h3>Perform The Fan of Mrs. Errant</h3>
<p>Recently, the enthusiasm of Shanghai people for performing plays is indeed as rampant as fire. The Drama Association has just finished performing "The Merchant of Venice," and the Xinyou Drama Society is following up with "Uncle Vanya." The Fudan Drama Society's "Cyrano" and the Nanguo Society's "Carmen" are also about to be staged in succession. The young ladies of Peicheng Girls' School,熏陶ed by such hot artistic air, are also happily organizing drama troupes and working hard every day. As a result, they have decided to perform "The Fan of Mrs. Errant." Regarding this script, there is no need for any introduction. Everyone knows that it is a translation by Mr. Hong Shen. The Drama Association performed it a few years ago with Ms. Tang Ying in the lead role. Last year, Tsinghua University in Peiping and Nankai University in Tianjin also performed it. This time, the ladies of Peicheng, in order to shine in the center of this theatrical movement, are paying great attention to the selection of personnel, especially the selection of the protagonist, Ms. Xu Errant. They spent several days deciding to invite Miss Chen Minde, a woman of great talent and beauty, to take on the role. It is said that Miss Chen grew up in the north and speaks fluent Mandarin, both cleverly and purely. Moreover, Miss Chen's graceful figure is also truly in line with the identity of the character in the play. Their performance date is June 16th, and the location is the Summer Peake Cinema. Tickets are divided into one yuan and two yuan types. In addition to the young ladies selling them themselves, various universities and major bookstores are also selling them on commission. I think that in such hot weather, watching The Fan of Mrs. Errant is more worthwhile than drinking a few bottles of soda and eating a few pieces of ice cream.</p>
<h3>The Cherry Blossom Drama Society of National Central University</h3>
<p>Chen Xianrong</p>
<p>Many universities in our country have drama society organizations (referring to most). National Central University is the highest institution of learning in the capital, so it cannot escape being an exception. However, which is the drama society of National Central University? It is the Cherry Blossom Drama Society.</p>
<p>The Cherry Blossom Drama Society is the only organization at National Central University that studies drama. She has a long and glorious history. She is a beautiful, rich, and sympathetic art society full of beauty and love, giving us the sweet spring of life and the relics of the soul. Her instructor is Mr. Zhao Boyan, whom we have always admired. Mr. Zhao is an associate professor at National Central University, specializing in drama. When he studied in Japan and Germany, he directed several new dramas, and the audience admired his reputation. After he took the position at National Central University, the Cherry Blossom Drama Society was established in the school, and he was invited to be the instructor. He compiled and translated the Austrian drama "The Taste of Love," but it was not formally rehearsed. The characters and plots of other dramas directed by him were all appropriate. Therefore, the Cherry Blossom Drama Society became famous at the time. Now Mr. Zhao has passed away. The performance on New Year's Day the year before last was directed by him during his lifetime. At that time, the performance address was borrowing the Lu shed recently erected by Zhongda. Its layout was the shed on the west was the theater, and the two sides were the dressing room and the storage room. Suspended outside the shed was a circle of cypress, with the words Cherry Blossom Theater. The shed was decorated with many colored paper strips, and the inside was wrapped with green cypress branches. In the center of the venue was a flower bed with a bright electric torch suspended above it. Colored paper was also radiating from the corners of the roof. In addition, the scenery was based on a simple and solemn spirit. Dark cloths were suspended on both sides in three rows, and gray cloths were horizontally tied along the three layers. The back history used sky blue as the background, and the white electric light shone straight from both sides, which was extremely elegant. The results of the performances were all quite successful, and we cannot but attribute this to Mr. Zhao.</p>
<p>Now, although Mr. Zhao is dead, the comrades of the Cherry Blossom Society have not been discouraged by this, let alone become negative. It is reported that they have recently held a large-scale recruitment of members, and there are already many male and female students who sincerely request the board of directors of the society to introduce them into the society.</p>
