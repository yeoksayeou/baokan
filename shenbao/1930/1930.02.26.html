<p>時評</p>
<h3>反敎運動</h3>
<p>宗敎亦爲近今世界之一問題。向來宗敎争端。每起於敎派之不同。如日前印度之運動獨立。印回兩敎，即起衝突。且影響於政争。此其一例也。然今日之所當重視者。不在敎派之争。而在所謂反敎運動。</p>
<p>今日反敎運動之最劇烈者爲蘇俄。雖其官塲否認有迫害舉動。然封閉敎堂。拘捕敎徒。流竄國外。呼號求援。則爲事實。其次西班牙政局變後。學生數千人。歡迎前被驅逐之學生會長。除狂呼打倒帝國外。并狂呼打倒敎會。街中苟遇敎徒。呼聲輒起。是西班牙之反敎運動。雖於事實上未有若何舉動。然已足表示其熱烈之意矣。</p>
<p>今日世界最流行之基督敎。一爲希臘派之正敎。即東教會。希臘蘇俄斯拉夫族等所奉行者也。一爲羅馬天主敎。所謂政敎合一者。意德（南部）法比西等國奉行者也。該敎又别爲耶穌敎。則德（北部）荷英美等國。多數奉行者也。勢力之大。可見一斑。蘇俄與西班牙所奉行之教。派别雖異。然皆同出於一源。故自蘇俄反敎運動發生後。該敎中不論何派。皆生反感影響。近日東敎會倡議仿照國際聯盟。組織基督敎聯盟。成否雖不可知。然其欲以擴大組織。團結一致之方法。抵制此項反敎運動。已灼然可見。故此問題。將來或成一重大糾紛。亦未可知也。</p>
<p>夫宗敎自由之説。吾人姑舍勿論。第此迷信宗敎之觀念。久已深入於世界大部分之人心。今欲掃除此項積習。一須有一種主義。以替代其宗敎之信仰一須科學知識發明。至於極點。則迷信觀念自消。然此二者。皆須積年累月。由之以漸。决非倉卒所能成功。倘若不用此漸進之法。而欲以一時之勢力。强奪其信仰之心。强制其勿做信仰所託視若性命之工作。則其勢甚難糾。紛豈能倖免。此乃顯然易見者也。</p>

<h3>取締「不怕死」影片昨日之言論</h3>
<p>關炯之聲明未曾審查</p>
<p>陳德徴之感想　市敎育局長陳德徴在敎育局紀念週發表對不怕死影片之感想</p>
<p>云、關於閻鍚山言行的謬誤、上一次紀念週中、已經詳細報告、現在閻氏部隊侵入魯境、公然反叛、惟中央已早有辦法、故閻氏之覆亡在即、决非意外之事了、最近本市大光明光陸兩家戲院放映侮辱我國的羅克「不怕死」影片事作一報告、並略述我的感想、該片内容、據看過的説、大槪是描寫華橋偷竊行爲盜刦手段、以及販土綁票等等不道德無理性的舉動、被主角羅克挪揄譏笑戲弄辱駡挨打、一一去制服形容華人的野蠻、卑鄙狀態、淋漓盡致、無所不用其極、委實是以影片來侮辱華人的、復旦大學敎授洪深、在看這張影片時、激於義慣、當塲演説、竟被掮洋商招牌的大光明中國人經理嗾使巡捕、押送捕房、歷四五小時、始得釋出、這一件事、我人不可以小事而不加注意、因爲電影是文藝之一、文藝可表發一個民族的國民性、也可以轉移一個民族的國民性、外人慣以富於肉感和含有危險性影片、輸入中國、要使中國觀衆於潛移默化中、消滅中國的國民性、令善於迎合未成熟青年而又一度侮辱中國的羅克、作第二次侮辱、若有一個人受人挨打、受人辱駡、莫不面紅耳赤、起而報復、現在羅克於銀幕上公然侮辱我整個的民族、凡是組成民族的一分子之中國國民、都應當起而反抗、嚴重交涉、從前美國芝加哥省某戲院放映「重見光明」一片、黑人觀衆、譁然共起、奪片焚毁、卒由導演者格雷斐斯脱加演千尺表演黑人所辦各種事業之井然有序以了事、被壓迫之黑人、在美國境内見到侮辱黑人片子而侮辱程度、遠不若「不怕死」的厲害、尙且有此舉動、難道侮辱中國影片進中國海口、在中國境内、並且在中國人設立的戲院裏、觀衆十九是中國人面前不去反抗、不去交涉嗎、我記到從前意國水手、因爲「街頭人」一片描寫意婦賣淫而奪片焚燬、反去委曲求全地道歉以了事、我又還記到英人以「殘花淚」一片、描寫華婦優於英婦即加禁止、華婦之是否不可勝於英婦、和意婦賣淫之是否言過其實、姑且不論、而羅克的「不怕死」、不要説我們中國人不相信華僑有這麽一會事、就是美國人和僑居美國的外國人、衹要到過唐人街或是見過中國人的、也不會相信的吧、按照國際公法講、任何一國人不可無故去侮辱任何一國人、按照文藝道德講、也是任何一國人不可去侮辱任何一國人的、美國人公認滑稽之王的羅克、何以把已所不欲而强施於人呢、羅克的用心、是要借高英夫婦販士案件一案、遂不顧邦交、不講道德去做那投機生意、不知高英案件、也不過國際間偶然發生的一種不幸案件、和二年前美國駐滬領事署檢察官胡薩受賄數萬元而下獄的同一不幸、我國電影商、從未把胡薩案件編成脚本、導演電影、而美國羅克竟以高英案件爲背景、更穿插卑鄙齷齪的蔑視華人舉動、侮辱中國國民性、到處放映、倘使不去嚴重交涉、一任他爲所要爲、那是中國的國民性完了、還要談什麽革命、</p>
<p>我聽得人家説、没有心肝的大光明主人、知道事情糟了、還用「該片已經政府審查」的話、去哄騙觀衆、於是有一部分人就責備到我們的電影檢查委員會來、其實掮着洋商招牌、出賣中國國民性一味奴顔婢膝唯利是圖的大光明主人、那裏知道自已是中國人、並且不知道中國政府、他口中的政府、一想就可意會得到的呀、本市電影檢委會中决不至昏瞶到那種地步、不過電影檢查委員會事前不能制止、以致洪深拘入捕房、觀衆出錢賣辱、而該片仍得按照固定時間、在本市日夜放映、這種錯誤、是電影檢委會所痛心忍受的、不過電影檢查委員會當去年成立時候、對於檢查租界上掮洋商牌子的影片公司所放映的影片、也曾詳細規劃、後來因爲出口辦法、部令暫緩實行、於是租界方面的影片檢查、就此無形停頓、不然那種片子、没有方法可以進口、更没有方法在大光明光陸放映、而洪深也不致進捕房、觀衆不至用寃枉錢了、現在市宣傳部和電影檢查委員會在消極積極二方正在進行、使該片和類似該片的電影永遠不許放映、同時希望在外國人手下做官吏的中國檢查員、此後要着實注意中國人辦的中國報紙、無論如何、不許登這一類的廣告、更希望出錢不認貨的中國觀衆、只顧好處不講理性的中國洋奴、不要再去賞光、不要再施奔走疏通的鬼計、須知不要民族、不要國家、不要政府、是共產匪徒的行爲、我們是信仰三民主義者、我們要求民族的自由平等而革命、倘有侮辱我民族的、我們堅决地反抗、不怕招怨、不怕樹敵、我們爲民族争體面而犯罪下獄、甚至槍决、也所不惜、要使外國人知道中國人也有爲民族而奮鬥的氣節、據有人設二院映放「不怕死」的時候、每次均告滿座、十九是中國人、十十是智識階級中人、鼓掌聲、歡呼聲、狂笑聲、十九又是出之於中國人、一方面的這是最足令人傷心的、我們不要説羅克底侮辱吧、我們只要爲什麽開戲院的加入檢查的主持言論機關的以及一切紳士式的觀衆們、他們都是中國人、也要帮着侮辱中國人、我們看到不出息的中國人、有那樣多、又聯想到敎育了、要知道這種情形、格外可以證明、所謂辦敎育、决不是單單去敎人讀書寫字、也决不是單單敎人説話作文、最大的任務、還在培養人格、鍛鍊氣節、造成一時代的優美淳厚風尙、否則敎育是徒然的、</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑  海客　　妻丨咦。我們結婚了只一個禮拜。你就駡我麽。　　夫丨請你原諒。我小心伺候了你三四年。好容易得到今天這個機會。　　甲女丨你的戀人寫了情書寄給你時。你用甚麽法兒使你的父親不拆。　　乙亅我呌他在信封上寫明「雪茄價目表」。并蓋上一個某某煙行的圖章。可是我父親是不吸煙會的會長。他一見就生氣。向字紙簏裏一丢。我趁他不見時。悄悄的拾起來了。師丨孩子。你家裏有四隻火腿、倘將兩隻送了給我。還有幾隻。生丨兩隻。師亅你的算術很不差。回去時喚你的父親再給你實地試騐一下。　　甲亅你借了我的雨傘去。已有兩個禮拜了。怎麽老不還我。乙亅天有不測風雲。須防備以後還要下雨。　　子亅父親“文明與野蠻”。是怎樣的分别父亅這是很簡單的。文明的人能在六千碼外用砲彈打死他的敵人。野蠻的人却只能用大刀砍人的頭。博物學家之寶貝  絜廬　　吾國研究自然科學之鼻祖。其我浙之鍾憲鬯先生乎。先生名觀光。鎭海柴橋人。前清季年。西學東漸。當時習理、化、動、植、礦學者。不易多觀、縱有杜亞泉、杜就田、張脩爵、華文祺、謝洪賚諸君之迻譯敎本、然提倡之力。以先生爲最著。先生能文章。擅口才。所編植物學、動物學、理化學諸教本。簡明流利。遠非他人所能及。當時絜廬齒穉。嘗在寗波府教育會日餘補習科時。得聆先生教授生理衛生學。明白曉鬯。娓娓動人。不如後之教師。拖泥帶水。不知所云。而又傍證博引　餖飣滿紙。故作夷語。晦澀欺人。此亦現代敎育之通弊。當時所不屑爲者也。後先生辦理科專修學校於海上。紹興蔡孑民先生等從學焉。故今日上海棋盤街之實學通藝館、科學儀器館。鎭海人爲獨多。即先生提倡之成績也。嗟夫。今之由學者而爲郎者衆矣。唯先生之爲科學界前輩。隱居武林。没没亡聞。知之者翻甚尟耳。先生之弟名蔚章。亦深造於動物學。今亦隱於農村染肆中。以自食其力。豈非難能可貴者乎。先生於植物學。研究最深。全中國恐無第二人。嘗在閩之某山中。斫榛莽。焚茆茷。攀援而登。蒐集奇卉異草。忽口中喃喃自言曰。好寶貝。好寶貝。言未竟。一盜自林樾中躍出。横刀先生前曰。趣以寶貝壽乃公。不則莫怪乃公之刃之無情也。先生囅然笑曰。措大焉得有寶。任好漢自覓可也。盜乃摸索先生周身。毫無所得。先生始悟頃自言好寶貝。盜以爲眞獲寶貝耳。遂以一草示盜曰。予所獲之好寶貝。蓋此耳。其物爲某科植物。予足跡遍海内。今日始於此獲得。可不謂之好寶貝乎。盜一笑而去。理甫先生之勸不裹足歌  妍千　　本刊曾誌嘉興錢理甫先生之爲人。並述其著作勸善文字之盛業矣。則先生遺作。當爲嗜讀本刊者所顧暏也。茲錄其奉勸女子不裹足歌以示世人。讀此便知先生固非頑固者流。其思想堪稱新頴焉。　　歌曰。人之手足是天生　婦女裹足苦萬分。若説大脚没人娶。廣東閨秀盡嫁人。西施王嬙均天足。不聞大脚被人哂。無鹽嫫母脚不小。賢德人人争委禽。江西湖北多小脚。事事依賴他夫君，兵火水災逃不動。遭了兵災辱了身。况且裹時不堪苦。膿血淋漓無人問。親娘愛女來裹脚。膿血越多裹越緊。筋斷骨折夜難寐。强種變成弱種人。裹了十脚成玩具　徒作夫男戲弄品。文明地方開通早。家家女子足已伸。女學堂中無小脚。惟有伎女脚伶仃。此乃以足悦人者。大家婦女何苦行。奉勸文明賢婦女。已裹速放未裹禁。文明男子須苦勸。再要裹脚被人輕。吾國同胞一半女。天足方生强種人。若要國强須放足　國强不被外夷侵。一片婆心苦口語。文明女子必須聽。女子若肯不裹脚。勸者功德千丈深。勸得人人皆放足、勝如普陀拜觀音。五張破碎的郵票  淺　　商人吳之卿。家頗小康。有一子。小名五官。不務正業。酷喜呼盧喝雉。於去冬十月中。赴鄕趕睹。爲湖匪綁去。索價六千金。吳之卿雖疼愛其子。然困於經濟。無以應付。爲之愁眉不展。其戚徐某。奔走接洽三數次。因湖匪居爲奇貨。僅允照碼八折。未告成功。吳之卿四出借貸。費時二月。勉得四千金。遂定元宵節。再託徐某往贖。詎於元宵前一日。吳之卿忽得湖匪來函。啓視之。内無信箋。僅破碎之郵票五枚。知其子五官已被撕票。號跳痛哭。一面倩人覓屍。一面設靈拜懺。遍發喪單。備極隆重。迨前日（十九）傍晚。其子五官忽乘輪歸來。吳之卿拭目細視。見確係生還。遂破涕而笑。一脚踼去靈座。並將白幕等撕得片片碎。問五官何得生還。竟未費分文。五官告以乘𨻶遁回。言湖匪皆嗜睹若命。彼困居匪窟。不覺技癢。偶在匪首前。自誇活手。匪首命彼敎導延爲上客。彼知匪窟終非安身之地。且中央委派能員剿匪。尤多危險。遂乘匪首睡熟時逃出云云。吳之卿聞言。又驚又喜。以所得撕票信。授其子。問此係湖匪所寄否。五官曰。係余所寄。因恐父親持金往贖。徒擲虚牝。故作此恐嚇信。本擬寫明匪窟生活。如何安適。因恐被匪檢查。遂未果。此信則得匪首同意。始蒙寄出。不意父親竟信以爲眞也。吳子因賭被綁，結果竟因賭獲免。不可謂非奇事矣。陜災别記  憤公　　天禍中國。故使年年饖饉　歲歲烽烟。水火盜賊。交相爲厲。如陜豫各省之災荒。其情其景。吾人雖未履其地。蓋亦於報端開之熟矣。從來災荒之最慘者。莫過於析骸爲薪。易子而食。不幸彼蒼不仁。災荒類告。續續不已。區域亦愈擴愈大　遂令此等慘痛之事實。亦如劉禹錫之即席賦詩。司空見憤。渾爲閒事。詎不大可哀耶。頃我聞某君談。陜災之重。良爲空前所未有。語我綦詳。然大抵亦不外析骸食子。他人固已先我而記。即記之。亦不足動人之心。姑錄其未經人道之一節。蓋慘痛中而含有少許趣味者也。西安一地。尙可以錢易米。唯厥價奇昂。人民無力購買。則亦等於在陳。職是之故。壯者皆挺而走險。盜賊蠭起。殺人越貨之事。數見不鮮。軍警不能禁。其良懦而有家室子女者。則竟異想天開。不顧廉恥。令妻女論值賣淫。以易升斗。此猶不足異。最可憐者。七八齡之女童。亦使之操神女生涯。女童不解痛苦。反引以爲樂。則以其父因女賣淫。必鮮其衣服。俾廣招徠昔日須逢令節反過年。始衣新衣。今則平時亦衣新衣。故不勝其樂也。迨一度接客後。備受風狂雨驟。方曉新衣之樂。不足抵其苦。往往向其父乞免。則又不之許。施以鴇母式之强迫。而女童乃如處活地獄矣。嗚呼。此豈爲人父者之本心耶。特爲生活要求。欲苟延殘喘。不得不如此耳。一副對聯兩家失和  履冰　　婚嫁之事。餽贈喜聯。爲社會上習見之舉。初無足異。不過所書聯句。一時下筆不愼。亦易引起糾紛。近聞一事。爲一副對聯。而起争執。結果兩家失和。　　友有姚君。靑年喪偶。遂復續絃。喜期有贈以催妝之聯者。句爲「今夕斯何夕」。「新人勝舊人」。姚君得之。不加思索。即高懸於新房内妝臺之畔。不意前妻之母。是日亦臨門觀禮。偶入洞房。覩斯聯句。不禁悲從中來。大哭之餘。繼以咆哮。謂妻死未久。即貪新厭舊。「新人勝舊人」之句。實可爲辱没前妻確證。遂揮手撕聯。片片成蝴蝶之舞。而新置傢具。亦遭搗毁。一塲喜事。遂致不歡。文字肇禍。於茲可信矣。心上温馨（一三六）  包天笑　　第九回　諸名士閧笑捉迷藏　一嬌娘任情施擁護兩個韻籟。。還有相反之點。。是一個嬌小。。　一個頎長。。一個盛髮如雲。。一個却頭髮不多。。那時上海堂子裏的姑娘。。都流行梳辫子。。辫子中也分出鬆辫緊辫。。光辫毛辫種種的不同。。而伊却只有一條比較人家短小的辫兒。。據伊跟局的人説。。去年生了一塲病。。因此把頭髮落去了不少。。因此姊妹和伊戲謔。。呼之爲小辫子陳絳雲。。伊對鏡也自恨恨。。説總有一天。。拿把剪子來。。把頭髮一齊鉸去。。大家也以爲伊使氣的話。。笑着勸伊。。頭髮會慢慢的生長起來的。。誰也知道十餘年後。。凡是年輕的女子。。眞一齊都鉸起頭髮來呢。。又因爲陳絳雲不大肯講話。。人家便説伊是個「磕不開的甏」。。又説伊是個泥塑美人。。那天大家説。。我們把陳絳雲呌來。。從伊來了以後。。默默的給伊記起來。。到伊去時。。一共可以説幾句話。。這個測騐的結果。。伊到了檯面上。。向來不大肯叫人的。。來時只笑了一笑。。便坐下來。。人家不給伊講話。。伊也照例不給人家講話。。到臨去時。。只説了兩句。。「伲轉堂唱去了。。晏歌請過來」的兩句。。翩若驚鴻的去了。。於是就有人報告。。這個堂唱。。一共是笑了一笑。。説了兩句話。。那時左詩晨也叫過伊的堂唱。。便給伊辯護道。。不説話也有不説話的好處。。古人詩云。。「花如解語還多事。。石不能言最可人。。」　不是也説不説話的好嗎。。孔夫子説。。「天何言哉。。四時行焉。。百物生焉。。天何言哉。。」鄭彦修道。。向來婦女們每喜多言。。因此長舌婦爲社會所憎惡。。但是不説話的却定規不説話。。所謂息夫人三年不言。。儘管别樣事體都可以做。。口總是不開。。這就是西廂記中的一句。。呌做「盡在不言中。。」説得大家都笑了。。時觀平道。。那末兩個四寶合照了一張照片。。稱之爲八寶圖。。兩個韵籟合照了呢。。稱他什麽。。嚴一塵道。。可以稱之爲雙韵圖。。左詩晨道。。很好很好。。幾時請他們來照。。時韵籟道。。你們要合照。。我是什麽時候都可以的。。你們只约定了絳雲妹妹。。通知我就是了。。時觀平道。。横豎我們要攝金釵十二圖咧。。我們約定了一天。。大規模的來照他們一下子。。大槪你們起來都不早的。。起來了吃吃飯。。化妝又要費去了一兩個鐘頭。。省得約三約四。。索性約定了一天。。大家來照相。。　我敎他們備足了材料。。你們儘管有多少人來拍好了。。紅氍毹紅毹聞見錄  看雲樓　　（一）關於徐碧雲的　　碧雲新劇。咸出薌垞居士手。居士編劇。取材務求新穎。塲子務求經濟。穿插以增趣味。使全劇無一間場。而又不致寂莫。眞高手也。綠珠虞小　蕭觀音諸齣。已有大名。而全部玉堂春。尤爲膾炙人口。碧雲之唱做。初非有加於慧生小雲。此劇聲譽。駕而上之。則劇本之功之。日前碧雲貼此。嗓音視前爲窄。幸吃調未低。味亦未失。然不知珍獲，則必致塌中。不可不愼也。嫖院廟會起解會審等塲。俱有精采。高慶奎之藍袍。滿面怒容。咬牙呼打。殆與碧雲新閙意見。借此洩氣耶。一笑。是夕李慧琴去長坂坡之靡夫人。大才小用。未展所長。慧琴在坤伶中。的是上材的。　　（二）關於新艷秋的　　艷秋自與小樓演别姬於春和院後。聲價大增。樊山贈詩。有「男伶勁敵女班頭」之句。然津沽聽戲。夙重女伶。故猶有僅許其爲女班頭。而未信其爲男伶勁敵者。最近開明戲院。約艷秋與小樓合作。開北平未有之例。向之懐疑者。始無間言。三天戲碼。小樓安天會長坂坡惡虎村。艷秋探母（菊朋四郎）長坂坡梅龍鎭（菊朋正德）玉堂春（菊朋藍袍）均賣滿座。秋每天戲份。加至一百元。廿二夕。仍在開明合唱兩天。秋演御碑亭鴛鴦塚。小樓演晉陽宮鐵籠山。小樓對秋極贊許。允爲配演全本貂蟬之呂布。昔瑤卿排此，小樓連仲同班。因故未唱。不圖名劇復見於今日。亦顧曲界之幸也。此劇出演後。即赴津。先與小樓在新新唱三夕。繼在中原唱五夕。秋每天包銀三百元。早有定約。又清逸居士。爲艷秋與小樓編合作之劇。一爲覇王遇虞姬。一爲聶政。聞已脱稿矣。</p>

<h3>The National Government Will Issue New Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Using the Boxer Indemnity Allotments from Seven Countries After 1930 as Collateral</p>
<p>Issuing Customs Gold Unit Bonds of $222 Million</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry and Commerce petitioned the Executive Yuan, requesting to use the remaining Boxer Indemnity funds from Russia, England, Japan, America, Italy, Belgium, and the Netherlands after 1930, amounting to over $37 million in national currency, as collateral to issue Customs Gold Unit Bonds of $222 million. The bonds will be named "Republic of China 1930 7% Boxer Indemnity Bonds" to establish a special bank, preparing for the implementation of the gold standard and the handling of international exchange. A detailed plan has been proposed for resolution. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui Urges Zhao Daiwen to Go to Nanjing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Zhihui telegraphed Zhao Daiwen on the 24th, saying: "To Zhao Cilong of Taiyuan, I have received your respectful message. I am overjoyed at your imminent arrival. Reading Bai Gong's telegram, he still calls the plenary session a laughingstock, which must be eliminated to stop the chaos effectively. Bai Gong has already taken crazy medicine, which is shocking. Today, the party is extremely firm in opposing communism, and Bai Gong is still privately worried and sighing, hoping for improvement. Yet, he suddenly wants to welcome the almost communist party that has been ousted to jointly stop the chaos. Although Niangziguan is fortified, Wang Shaogu and his ilk, following the plans of Wang Jingwei and Chen Gongbo, bring their disciples and grandsons, employing a self-sacrificing ruse to sneak in. Bai Gong has tasted their ways in Taiyuan the year before last and recently in Hebei. The Prime Minister, with his great fearlessness, was good at manipulation but unfortunately became disabled. Many successors are immature scholars who also want to drink poison to quench their thirst. To this day, the Divine Land is restless, and great chaos is brewing but has not yet erupted. Does Bai Gong consider himself of the same tribe as the world's demons? After years of meditation, his anger precept suddenly moves, and he is willing to invite a wolf into his house. Such courage is truly astonishing! Zou Haibin and his followers, having lost their jobs, are fickle and do not care about principles, which is pitiful. Entrusting these people to eliminate the laughingstock, will it stop the chaos or cause greater chaos? Sir, you do not wish to see the sinking of the Divine Land. I hope you will convey my heartfelt concerns to Bai Gong and ultimately risk your old life to come here quickly. Once the storm clears, peace will surely return. I eagerly await you. Your younger brother, Wu Jingheng, bows respectfully." (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Military Preparations on the Shanxi Side</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A respectful telegram from Beiping: (1) When Yan Xishan issued the circular telegram, he immediately ordered his subordinates to mobilize and prepare for war. (2) It is heard that Yan plans to first drive the Northwest Army and miscellaneous Henan troops south as the vanguard, while the Shanxi army will supervise them from behind. (3) The Northwest Army will issue a joint telegram to the Shanxi side, requesting an advance payment of 2 million yuan for departure expenses and asking for the supply of military equipment and ammunition. It is said that there has been no reply yet. (4) The civilian politicians in northern Shanxi do not advocate sending troops, saying that betraying the central government has a hundred harms and no benefits. The miscellaneous Henan troops cannot be utilized. Once the Northwest Army's wings are strengthened, they will surely turn against them. Joining hands with other Western Hills Conference factions and reorganizationists is tantamount to recognizing thieves as fathers. They ask Yan not to act rashly, lest he become someone else's puppet. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Anti-Religious Movement</h3>
<p>Religion is also a problem in today's world. Historically, religious disputes often arise from differences in denominations. For example, the recent movement for independence in India saw conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, which also affected political disputes. This is one example. However, what should be emphasized today is not the dispute between denominations but the so-called anti-religious movement.</p>
<p>The most intense anti-religious movement today is in Soviet Russia. Although its officials deny any persecution, the closure of churches, arrest of believers, and expulsion to foreign countries seeking help are all facts. Second, after the change in the political situation in Spain, thousands of students welcomed the previously expelled president of the student association. Besides shouting slogans to overthrow imperialism, they also shouted slogans to overthrow the church. If they encountered believers in the street, shouts would immediately arise. Therefore, although the anti-religious movement in Spain has not taken any action in fact, it is enough to show its enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The most popular Christianity in the world today is the Orthodox Church of the Greek rite, namely the Eastern Church, which is practiced by Greeks, Russians, and Slavs. Another is Roman Catholicism, the so-called union of politics and religion, which is practiced by countries such as Italy, Germany (southern), France, Belgium, and Spain. The religion is also divided into Protestantism, which is mostly practiced by countries such as Germany (northern), the Netherlands, England, and the United States. The magnitude of its influence can be seen. Although the denominations practiced in Soviet Russia and Spain are different, they all come from the same source. Therefore, since the anti-religious movement occurred in Soviet Russia, regardless of denomination, there have been adverse reactions. Recently, the Eastern Church has advocated imitating the League of Nations to organize a Christian alliance. Whether or not it will succeed is unknown, but it is clear that it wants to use the method of expanding the organization and uniting to resist this anti-religious movement. Therefore, this problem may become a major dispute in the future.</p>
<p>We will not discuss the theory of religious freedom for the time being. However, this superstitious concept of religion has long been deeply rooted in the hearts of most people in the world. If one wants to eliminate this accumulated habit, one must have a doctrine to replace its religious belief, and scientific knowledge must be developed to the extreme, then superstitious concepts will disappear naturally. However, both of these require years of accumulation, gradually. It is definitely not something that can be achieved hastily. If one does not use this gradual method but wants to use the power of the moment to forcibly seize their hearts of faith and forcibly prevent them from doing the work that their faith regards as life, then the situation will be difficult to correct, and disputes cannot be avoided. This is obvious.</p>

<h3>Expected Reopening of the London Naval Conference</h3>
<p>French Premier Briand to Personally Intervene</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Deny News of Impending Breakdown</p>

<h3>Austrian Chancellor Visits Germany</h3>
<p>Suspicions Related to the Unification Issue</p>
<p>Triggering Various Speculations among the French</p>
<p>Agence Nationale, Berlin, 24th: Austrian Chancellor Schober has officially visited Germany, and after residing in Berlin for three days, he has now departed for Austria. The French press is filled with speculation, many suggesting that the primary topic of discussion between the Austrian and German Chancellors was the issue of German-Austrian unification. In reality, Schober's visit to Germany had two specific purposes: first, to negotiate a German-Austrian trade agreement; and second, to explain the details of his previous visit to Rome and the conclusion of the Italian-Austrian Friendship and Arbitration Treaty. German political circles had initially harbored some misunderstandings about this, but after Schober's explanation and clarification that the treaty represents the first step in Austria's important foreign policy direction, and his solemn declaration that there were no other secret clauses beyond those already published, these misunderstandings have been completely dispelled. As for the discussions between the two Chancellors, they were limited to reiterating the friendship and interdependence between the two countries and did not involve the issue of unification.</p>

<p>Japan Associated Press: Today's Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial titled "A Good Opportunity to Refresh Diplomacy," discussing the China issue as follows: Foreign Minister Shidehara stated in the Lower House on January 21st that in today's circumstances, an overbearing diplomatic policy not only makes it impossible to enhance national prestige but often makes it difficult to achieve its objectives. The Tanaka cabinet's diplomacy, failing to adapt to changing times, promoted a conservative and reactionary policy. Its so-called proactive policy, devoid of substance, has severely harmed Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, relations between the two countries must be guided by justice and fairness. Furthermore, in order to restore China's treaty-based equal status, full cooperation should be provided, while simultaneously ensuring the safety of Japanese residents in China and protecting Japan's economic interests. We and the nation fervently hope that Prime Minister Hamaguchi and Foreign Minister Shidehara, in accordance with the current cabinet's declaration, will handle the aforementioned China issue with a steady and steadfast new-era diplomacy. The people's support for the government and the party in this general election also lies in this.</p>
<p>Yamamoto's Plan to Travel Abroad</p>
<p>To Alleviate Pent-Up Frustration</p>
<p>Agence Telegraphique Suisse: Mr. Yamamoto Teijiro, the former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and the originator of the Land Reform Bill, harbored deep dissatisfaction during the previous cabinet due to unfulfilled ambitions. Adding to this, in the recent general election, he lost his long-held stronghold of Sado to another party, further depressing him. He plans to heed the advice of friends and travel leisurely through Europe and America to vent his frustration and boredom and to prepare for a future comeback. He is expected to depart around the end of March or early April.</p>
<h3>Homicide is the Intrinsic Nature of Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Deep Hatred of Religion is deeply resented but there is nothing that can be done</p>
<p>Words of British Prime Minister MacDonald</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: British Prime Minister MacDonald, in a letter to a certain gentleman discussing the Russian persecution of religion, stated that the government certainly abhors religious persecution, but the facts are what they are, and what can be done remains the question. The easiest thing to do in the world is to make rash moves that increase the suffering of religious believers in Russia. No matter how much public sentiment is stirred up, we should avoid it. Many of the rumors about religious persecution are not factual. However, the history of religion in Russia is unfortunately filled with records of homicide. The revolutionary psychology created by centuries of oppression contains elements of intense and narrow-minded advocacy. The British government's diplomatic recognition of Russia is based purely on practical and political reasons and does not involve domestic beliefs or politics. Therefore, agitation based on political or religious grounds cannot cause any government to deviate from its international relations and the norms of prudence, or to isolate a country as an outlaw nation. It will not make this country subservient to the world and reason, but will have the opposite effect. Even today, the tone and fervor of the protesters have hardened the Russian government's resolve and have allowed the Russian government to seize this opportunity to agitate its people by claiming that this is part of a conspiracy by other governments to prepare for war against Russia.</p>
<h3>British Parliament Questions Matters Regarding China</h3>
<p>Weihaiwei Recovery Issue</p>
<p>Huludao Port Construction Issue</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: British Foreign Secretary Henderson stated in the House of Commons today in response to a member's question that the Weihaiwei agreement has not yet been fully resolved but may soon be submitted to Parliament. A Conservative member suggested that a clause be added to the agreement to allow British ships to Weihaiwei, and the Foreign Secretary replied that he would pay attention to this suggestion.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: The contract between the Dutch Harbour Company and the Ping-Liao Railway for the construction of the Huludao port was raised in the House of Commons today. According to the contract, the port expenses are to be paid from the railway surplus. A member raised this question, and the Foreign Secretary replied that the British Ambassador to China has been instructed to protest against loans not handled by Sino-British companies, using the railway as collateral, as a violation of the railway loan contract. The British Ambassador has also been instructed to ask China to allocate all the railway surplus to pay off the railway debt and not to implement the Huludao port construction contract without clearing the debt and obtaining the consent of the Sino-British Company.</p>
<h3>British-Egyptian Treaty Negotiations to Continue</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: According to official sources, the Egyptian delegation, led by Prime Minister Nahas, will come to London within a week to negotiate the British-Egyptian treaty. It is reported that the British government has asked Sir Loraine, the British official stationed in Egypt and Sudan, to return to London during the British-Egyptian negotiations.</p>
<h3>Vietnamese Independence Movement Suffers Setback</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 25th: In recent disturbances in Vietnam, five French military officers have died, and several others have been injured. According to a report from Hanoi, a certain party leader and several of his associates have been arrested. Vietnamese soldiers are still searching for rebels in the lower reaches of the river. The Governor-General of Vietnam has issued a proclamation to the public, stating that the area has returned to peace, and farmers can return to their fields.

<h3>Hughes Assumes Office as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 20th: Hughes was sworn in today as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Judge Holmes administered the oath. After the swearing-in ceremony, Hughes went to the court to begin his work.</p>
<h3>British Free Trade Policy</h3>
<p>Conservatives Also Know It Is Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: The new monthly magazine of the National Conservative Association, titled Homeland and Empire, contains excerpts from talks of former Prime Minister Baldwin. According to the report, free trade within the Empire, although still a principle to which the Conservative Party should strive, is currently impossible to implement in reality. The political leaders of the overseas self-governing territories do not agree with this policy, and if it is insisted upon, it will force the colonies into bankruptcy. Furthermore, various countries have reciprocal treaties regarding colonial import trade, and mandated territories are particularly difficult to navigate. It is also said that if the newly established Imperial Unity Party destroys the Conservative Party's unity, free trade within the Empire will be even more hopeless in the coming years. The Conservative Party's protective measures, such as Imperial Preference, rationalization, and cooperation, are merely sound methods for achieving free trade within the Empire.</p>
<h3>Coup in Dominican Republic</h3>
<p>Two Forts Have Fallen</p>
<p>President Takes Refuge in the U.S. Embassy</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 24th: A report was received here today that a coup has occurred in the Dominican Republic in South America. According to a telegram from Mr. Curtis, the U.S. Ambassador to that country, Dominican President Vásquez has arrived at the U.S. Embassy, requesting accommodation for himself, his wife, and the vice president. Currently, only the President is in the embassy; his family has taken refuge in the forts overlooking Santo Domingo, the capital city. According to a telegram sent by the President to the Dominican Embassy in Washington, the insurgents are members of the opposition party, supported by a portion of the army, and have occupied two forts and are now advancing on the capital. President Vásquez took office on July 12, 1924, and his term will expire this year. The country has repeatedly experienced internal strife, and the United States has sent troops several times to suppress it. When Vásquez took office, his term was originally four years, but the constitution was amended in 1927, extending his term by two years. When Vásquez took office, the U.S. military had withdrawn from the country not long before. He soon signed a treaty with the United States, under which the United States lent him US$25 million to maintain public debt credit, and another US$10 million to reform domestic affairs, with customs duties to be supervised by U.S. officials as a condition.</p>
<h3>Japan Continues to Ship Cash to the United States</h3>
<p>Agence Telegraphique Suisse, Tokyo, 25th: The Mitsubishi Bank has once again shipped 5 million yen in cash for export on the Chunhun Maru. The domestic banks' cash shipments are continuing. Domestic banks are also using cash to repay debts due to high exchange rates, and the amount has increased sharply. Cash reserves are expected to fall below 900 million yen this month. Furthermore, the cash is all handled by foreign banks, shipped from Japan to the United States, from the United States to China, and then from China to Japan, circulating repeatedly. This trend is expected to continue.</p>
<h3>The Flavor of Eight Years Behind Bars</h3>
<p>Assassin of Hara Kei to be Released Tomorrow and abandon his butcher knife to become a Buddha on the spot</p>
<p>Agence Telegraphique Suisse, Tokyo, 25th: Nakaoka Konichi, the person who assassinated former Japanese Prime Minister Hara Kei in 1920, will be released from prison on the 27th. Having received three pardons, he will see the light of day again after eight years in prison. It is said that after his release, Nakaoka will shave his head and become a monk, entering the Hara family's ancestral temple, Daijiji Temple in Morioka, to accompany Hara Kei's spirit for the rest of his life.</p>
<h3>Early Spring in Japan Due to Summer Solar Sunspots</h3>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th: Since the 23rd, the weather in various parts of Japan has been unusually warm. The temperature in Tokyo on the afternoon of the 24th was 25 degrees Celsius. Dr. Fujiwara of the Central Meteorological Observatory said that even in the heat of London, the temperature is not 24 or 25 degrees Celsius. The current Japanese climate is unprecedented in 60 years. The reason for this is the relationship between the low pressure in the Sea of Japan and the ocean currents. Also, since the end of last year, the number of sunspots has increased dramatically, especially in January of this year. Therefore, it is not known whether this phenomenon has influenced the current situation.</p>

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government to Repair the Luan River Embankment</h3>
<p>The Hebei Construction Department recently received a letter from the North China Water Conservancy Commission requesting funds to repair the Luan River embankment and dredge the river channel. Director Wen Shouquan specifically raised the issue for discussion at yesterday's (21st) regular meeting of the Provincial Government Committee. A resolution was passed to order the county to raise funds for repairs. The proposal is recorded as follows: The North China Water Conservancy Commission's letter stated that at the 7th Commission meeting held on January 13th, the chief technician presented a plan for the Luan County East City embankment and water control project. The project is divided into three types: one is the embankment project, the second is the embankment and dike construction project, and the third is the river channel restoration project. It was resolved that, with reference to the first and third projects, the width of the diversion channel should be reduced, two low stone dams should be built, and the East Gate embankment project should be constructed. A letter was sent to the Hebei Provincial Construction Department requesting that funds be raised as soon as possible. Now that the project plan has been completed in detail, the entire project will be implemented in two phases. The first phase includes three parts, with an estimated cost of 159,400 yuan. The second phase includes two parts, with an estimated cost of 7,800 yuan. Accordingly, the project plan is attached and sent to your department for review. It is hoped that funds will be raised as soon as possible to start construction. Attached is the project plan and map, etc. The Luan County Registration Office had previously reported that the Luan River floods annually, damaging the people, submerging crops, and requesting that repairs be ordered. The Hebei Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee forwarded the letter to the Provincial Government, and the department dispatched technician Yang Liming to conduct a survey and report that the Luan River originates outside Dushikou and enters the sea southeast of Laoting County, 900 li long. The upstream river channel is wide, and the water flow is slightly slower, so there is no major problem. However, the mountain ranges on both banks north of Luan County meander, narrowing the water surface and intensifying the flow. It is said that in the past, the base of Hengshan Mountain protruded, suppressing the westward flow of the Luan River. The river channel was still four or five li away from the city. However, when the Pingfeng Railway Bridge was built in 1887, the mountain was blasted away, and the river channel gradually shifted westward. From 1924 to 1926, the outside of the East Gate collapsed for two li. The three villages of Nanchangzhuang, Zhuzhuangzi, and Maguanying have all collapsed. The outside of the East Gate is submerged in water, and many demolished houses have been removed, leaving only one-third remaining. The land through which the Luan River flows is extremely sandy. The west bank is too steep, and the water flows beneath it, forming a concave channel. Even without floods, the soil is loose, and the force of gravity causes it to collapse, which is also very dangerous. Proposed measures were submitted to the Provincial Government and submitted to the 74th meeting of the assembly for resolution, ordering the county to raise funds for repairs according to the proposed measures. One year has passed since then, and the county has not yet raised funds for repairs. The project is important, and it is difficult to delay. In view of the previous reasons, the Provincial Government should promptly raise the necessary funds to start construction to strengthen river defense and protect the people's lives. All the estimated funds for the first phase are 159,400 yuan, and the estimated funds for the second phase are 7,800 yuan. It is proposed to order the Ministry of Finance to allocate the funds in the specified amount or find other ways to facilitate construction. The above is submitted for public decision. (The project plan is omitted due to space limitations)</p>

<p>The Hangzhou Municipal Government ordered all dyeing workshops to relocate to the outskirts of the city in order to emphasize hygiene. The industry has repeatedly requested exemption from relocation, but has not been granted approval. Currently, the silk and cloth industries believe that the price of dyed silk and cloth is insufficient, and if it is in the townships, danger is imminent, and the workshops are really unable to bear this responsibility. Yesterday, they also submitted separate reports to the Provincial and Municipal Governments, requesting that they consider the merchants' difficulties, revoke the order, and formulate other management measures.</p>
<p>Local cloth was approved for tax-free sales, and all procedures for requesting tax-free certificates were also approved by the Ministry of Finance.

The town's cloth industry association specially submitted a request to the Hangzhou General Chamber of Commerce yesterday, forwarding it to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Jianghai Customs promptly investigate the case and release the goods to facilitate commercial transport.</p>

<h3>Post-War Conference in Northern Anhui Opens</h3>
<p>Bengbu Communication, Temporary Office of the Anhui Provincial Government in Bengbu: In order to understand the actual situation of the region and facilitate post-war reconstruction, county magistrates and representatives of local public organizations from various counties in northern Anhui were summoned to Bengbu to hold a post-war conference for northern Anhui. It was originally scheduled to take place on the 20th, but due to insufficient attendance, it was postponed to 10:00 AM on the 21st at the Huachang Street Commercial Travelers' Inn. More than one hundred people attended, including county magistrates, representatives of various organizations, and guests. After the opening ceremony, Chairman Yuan Lichen delivered an opening address, stating that northern Anhui is far from the provincial government, and the suffering of the people is often not well known. The implementation of administrative policies also often faces limitations. The counties of northern Anhui have suffered from military disasters and banditry more than once in recent years. Last year, due to drought and poor harvests, coupled with the occupation of the region by reactionary troops for more than two months at the end of the year, who arbitrarily extracted taxes and extorted supplies, the local area was devastated and the people were living in misery. The administrative system was also disrupted, and bandits sprung up everywhere, blocking transportation. The direct and indirect losses suffered by the people are countless. In view of this, the provincial government has specially established a temporary office in Bengbu. I feel that there are many things to be done to restore order in the region and alleviate the suffering of the people. Therefore, this post-war conference is being convened. You are on the ground, have a closer understanding of the situation, and have personally suffered from it. You must have insightful ideas on how to deal with the past and rectify the future, and provide good strategies for progress. Please, representatives, put forward your discussions at the conference, do not pursue unrealistic goals, do not engage in empty talk, and strive for practicality and effectiveness. Prioritize urgent matters and focus on progress, so that the post-war conference will not be in vain. Then, Xiong Gonglie, the magistrate of Fengtai County, Jiang Shuxun, the magistrate of Fengyang County, and representatives of public organizations from various counties delivered speeches in succession. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<p>Today (the 22nd), starting at 9:00 AM, the first meeting was held in the main hall of Tangyuan on Guofu Street, with thirty-one attendees, chaired by Yuan Lichen. The following matters were resolved: (1) Case of suppressing bandits in various counties of northern Anhui (proposed by the First Group of the Provincial Government Office).

(3) Regarding the third item of the original proposal, it was resolved to formulate measures for clearing rural areas based on the regulations on clearing rural areas issued by the provincial government last year, with reference to the situation in northern Anhui, and to carry out clearing of rural areas.

(4) Regarding the fourth item of the original proposal, it was resolved to merge it into the third item for handling. Jiang Shuxun proposed that the joint defense measures in the third proposal were of the same nature as the fifth item, and that they should be discussed together. The resolution was passed. (5) Regarding the fifth item of the original proposal, it was resolved to pass it in principle, and Jiang Shuxun, Peng Zhenqiu, Song Shike, She Nianci, and Jiang Huashi were designated as drafting committee members to draft joint defense measures, convened by Jiang Shuxun. (6) Regarding the sixth item of the original proposal, it was resolved that the provincial government has already established regulations for rewarding and punishing bandits, and there is no need for discussion.

Liu Yihua moved that in addition to replenishing ammunition, steel cannons and mortars should also be purchased for application. It was resolved that each county should submit a list of the types and quantities of shells required to the office for forwarding and procurement. Wu Shuxun proposed to change the agenda and discuss the fourth proposal in advance and move the second proposal to the afternoon for discussion. The resolution was passed. (2) Proposal to request the restoration of transportation to save commerce and the people's livelihood (proposed by the Bengbu General Chamber of Commerce). It was resolved (1) that the office should forward the proposal to the Ministry of Railways and send a letter to the Jinpu Railway Bureau to restore freight transportation, and send a letter to the local military officers to assist. (2) The magistrates of the counties along the Huai River should be responsible for suppressing bandits on both sides of the Huai River, and the military officers should be requested to send troops to assist.

(2) For school properties that are not under the jurisdiction of the Education Bureau, the county governments should assist the Education Bureau in recovering them. (2) Proposal on rectifying miscellaneous tax revenues in various counties of northern Anhui (proposed by the Second Group of the Office).

(3) For handling procedures, the purchase of machine lines and installation methods can be discussed with the Third Group of the Office. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. (22nd)</p>
<h3>American Merchants' Plan to Monopolize Sichuan Tung Oil</h3>
<p>Preparing a Capital of 10 Million US Dollars</p>
<p>Building Large Oil Tanks in Chongqing, Yichang, Wuhan, and Shanghai</p>
<p>Building Twenty-Four River Transport Vessels for Exclusive Transport</p>
<p>Establishing Branches Along the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers</p>
<p>Chongqing Communication: Sichuan tung oil has a very large production volume and excellent quality, ranking first in the world. The Sichuan tung oil won a special award in the Canadian oil quality competition last October, which is clear evidence of its quality. In recent years, this export trade has generated substantial profits, so people generally flock to it, and the planting of tung trees is all the rage. Mr. Warington, the American general manager of the American Sichuan Tung Oil Company, came to Sichuan in person to plan and handle the business because American industry needs a huge amount of Sichuan tung oil. He arrived in Chongqing on an American warship the other day. According to reports, the company has built twenty-four large and small river vessels at the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai for transportation, and has also built four small shallow-water tugs for transportation on the Jialing River, from Wanxian to more than a dozen counties including Jiading, Chongqing, Suining, Shunqing, Suiding, Quxian, Guang'an, and Hanyuan, where branches will be established. Branches will also be established in villages and towns upstream of Chongqing, such as Yuquanxi, Zhongbaisha, and Youxi. It is reported that he brought a huge sum of money, 10 million US dollars, and plans to build 50,000-ton oil tanks in Chongqing, Yichang, Wuhan, and Shanghai, and will invite merchants to contract the project, stipulate regulations for collecting oil, and issue advertisements to attract merchants from far and near. If they can handle the oil collection, a deposit of 30,000 yuan or more is required, depending on the distance. This is currently being actively pursued. Tung oil is a major category of Sichuan exports. After being monopolized by foreign merchants, although there are substantial profits, they will also be exploited by others. (China News Agency)</p>

<h3>Clearing Rural Areas Expenses in Liaoning Province</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication: The Provincial Clearing Rural Areas Bureau previously established county bureaus in various counties.

This was submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. The 88th meeting of the Provincial Committee decided to submit it to the Department of Finance for review.

<h3>Singaporean Overseas Chinese Request Lower Postal Rates</h3>
<p>Singapore Communication: Last May, the Ministry of Communications of the National Government resolved to ban private postal bureaus. Overseas Chinese heard the news and ran around telling each other in horror. They all believed that if this resolution were implemented, the families of tens of millions of overseas Chinese in Fujian and Guangdong provinces, who rely on remittances from abroad for their livelihoods, would no longer be able to remit money. Therefore, leaders of various overseas Chinese communities convened a meeting at the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and unanimously decided to establish an All-Overseas Chinese Congress to Petition for the Preservation of Private Postal Bureaus and to strongly appeal to the government. As a result, the Ministry of Communications, although agreeing to temporarily postpone the ban on private postal bureaus, still wanted to increase postal rates. The overseas Chinese believed that increasing postal rates would be an unbearable burden for the working class. Therefore, they telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to petition and also requested consideration from the local government. The text presented to the Ministry of Communications is recorded below: "We have repeatedly appealed to your ministry regarding the matter of private postal services in our previous documents and telegrams. We have also telegraphed on January 4th and 6th of this year, beseeching you to sympathize with the difficulties of overseas Chinese and approve our requests for reducing postal rates. We understand that you have been observing the situation, but more than a month has passed and we have not received any instructions. The overseas Chinese are eagerly waiting, believing that this increase in private postal rates is extremely important to the lives of overseas Chinese, especially the working class, who are particularly indignant. This is because if postal rates for letters coming from China are increased, postal rates for letters going abroad will also be implemented as an example, resulting in a double burden that is unbearable. Therefore, we have elected Chen Sien, a Chinese member of the Singapore Legislative Council, Chen Yuanquan, the chairman and vice-chairman of the Singapore Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, and others to represent us in meeting with the acting governor of Singapore to explain the plight of the overseas Chinese and request a reduction. According to the reports from these representatives, the acting governor of Singapore summoned the Postmaster General and the Secretary for Chinese Affairs to attend the meeting and discuss solutions. The local government is well aware of the situation of our overseas Chinese, so when the representatives made their representations, they were all moved and expressed their acceptance. However, the acting governor and the Postmaster General said that this initiative originated from a letter from your government requesting a ban and an increase in rates, and showed letters from our country's Post Office, including a key passage stating that, in addition to stating that overseas Chinese remit more than ten million in silver each year, they requested that the letter package system be maintained as before while increasing postal rates. Therefore, the Postmaster General here also followed suit. This point should be made clear to the overseas Chinese. After the representatives explained again, stating that the rich among the overseas Chinese are few and far between, while the poor make up almost the entire population. After checking the books of various private bureaus, it was found that the rich send fewer letters but remit more money, while the poor remit less money but send more letters. Increasing postal rates would burden the working class and cannot be compared to the large amount of money remitted by the overseas Chinese annually. The Secretary for Chinese Affairs also felt uneasy about increasing postal rates according to postal regulations, as the post office can only deliver domestic and foreign private postal letters to private bureaus and cannot deliver them directly to the recipients. Therefore, the acting governor agreed to consider the matter carefully and respond later. Considering this situation, the increase in rates was not the original intention of the local authorities, but the motivation was due to our country. The overseas Chinese are foolish and confused, believing that our National Government often has fine words and teachings and wants to alleviate all the suffering of our overseas Chinese. Now, the suffering has not been removed, but more suffering is added. The pain has not been alleviated, but the pain is increased. Besieged from inside and outside, who can solve our plight? Our postal authorities, even if they want to increase annual revenue, should take a comprehensive view and adopt a gradual approach. Therefore, we dare to reiterate our previous intentions: the postal rate for letters sent abroad should be six cents, and the postal rate for letters sent domestically should be five cents. We earnestly request your ministry to adopt this and order the Post Office to approve and implement it, and please telegraph the Postmaster General here, showing consideration for the difficulties of the overseas Chinese, approving our request, and fulfilling the practical intention of caring for the overseas Chinese. This would be most virtuous and convenient. Respectfully submitted by Li Weinan, acting chairman of the All-Overseas Chinese Congress to Petition for the Preservation of Private Postal Bureaus, Singapore, to Wang, Minister of Communications. (21st)</p>
<p>Appendix: Petition to the Governor of Singapore. The undersigned representatives of private postal bureaus respectfully submit the following to Your Excellency. Your Excellency understands the methods of private postal services. Our overseas Chinese working class remits money to their families in China through merchants engaged in the exchange business, which is the so-called "private bureaus." The method is that the remitter hands over the money they want to remit and the letter to their family to the private bureau. The private bureau collects these letters and bundles them into a general package, each package containing approximately thousands of letters, which the post office forwards to its branch in China. The post office also reports the number of silver and letters in each package to the post office and charges three cents per letter. The post office delivers the general package to the Chinese branch, which distributes the silver and letters to the recipients in various inland villages and townships. At the same time, it also collects return letters, which are sent back to the private bureau in Singapore from the general package through the post office. The remitter can pick up the return letters from their family at any time. This method is excellent. Approximately 200,000 of these silver letters are sent each month (including overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, as the silver letters from the Netherlands are also forwarded by the local private bureaus). The families of overseas Chinese workers are mostly in small villages and townships in China, and there is no way to deliver the remittances other than through the private bureaus. Furthermore, most of the return letters from China cannot be delivered by the post office. In Singapore, those who are engaged in planting cannot have their addresses delivered by the post office. This is especially true for rubber plantation workers who are employed here today and there tomorrow. Other manual laborers and domestic servants also often change employers. All of these working classes have special circumstances and feel it is difficult to send silver and letters. The establishment of private bureaus cannot be abolished. Each worker remits between two and three yuan per month, with each remittance costing four cents (three cents for postage and one cent for the cost of the private bureau sending the silver to the village and collecting the return letter). The private bureaus have no profit from the four cents charged. Their profit comes from the rise and fall of exchange rates. A month ago, our government indicated that it would cancel the general package system, which caused an outcry among the overseas Chinese here. As a result, an All-Overseas Chinese Congress was convened and a committee was formed to petition the National Government. Finally, the government agreed that the general package method could continue to be implemented as before. Recently, we received a letter from the Singapore Chinese Affairs Department stating that from March 1st, the fee for postal general packages may be increased to twelve cents. Based on this, the fee for each letter has increased by more than three cents. If the postal fee for general packages in Singapore is increased, mainland China is bound to increase accordingly. The fee for each letter will increase from four cents (three cents for postage and one cent for the cost of sending silver letters back) to twenty-three cents (twelve cents for Singapore postage, ten cents for Chinese postage, and one cent for private bureau fees). The increase will be nearly 500%. If the amount of money remitted is large, this will not matter much. But the amount of money remitted is only two or three yuan, so the impact will be very great. Your Excellency can imagine the suffering of the working class. We respectfully request that the post office maintain the postal fees for general packages as before. If the government considers it necessary to increase the fees, we ask that you reduce them to the lowest possible limit. We respectfully submit the following two reasons to Your Excellency: First, the private bureau general package method directly saves the post office a huge amount of time and labor. From this perspective, the fee paid for each letter in the general package should be cheaper than for ordinary letters. The method of posting ordinary letters requires each letter to have a stamp purchased and affixed, and the post office stamps each letter and distributes each letter. However, the general package method bundles thousands of letters into one package and only needs to be stamped once. On the surface, this procedure seems insignificant, but the private bureaus receive approximately 200,000 letters each month. The time and labor saved by the post office is very large. Conversely, if the general package system is abolished, the number of letters received and sent by the post office each month will increase by more than 200,000. In addition to regular customers, there will be more than 200,000 additional people to serve, more than 200,000 additional stamps sold each month, 200,000 additional letters stamped, and 200,000 additional letters distributed. The post office will inevitably have to hire more staff and expand its offices. In China, each of these more than 200,000 letters has a return letter, and the post office will stamp, distribute, and deliver them. All of these steps are now handled by the private bureaus, who are doing all the work for the post office. The post office only needs to deliver the general package to a small number of private bureaus, without having to directly deliver it to more than 200,000 different addresses (including recipients who live far from the post office, which is not certain). From this perspective, the time and labor saved by the private bureaus for the post office is not small. Second, we request that Your Excellency show consideration for the poor conditions of the working class. The existence of private bureaus is for the benefit of these people. If those who used to pay four cents to send two yuan are forced to pay twenty-three cents, we believe that the amount demanded is too harsh. The monthly income of workers is limited, and every cent is the price of their blood and sweat. We especially ask Your Excellency to show mercy and not make the coolie workers suffer unspeakable pain. There is one more point that we want to make clear to Your Excellency: we are not merchants who run private bureaus. We are only speaking on behalf of the working class and have no personal interests involved."</p>
<p>Local Communications</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Preparing for Afforestation Campaign: The Department of Agriculture and Mining instructed the county government that March 12th is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death anniversary and has been designated as Arbor Day and announced. Now that the afforestation season is approaching, how to expand afforestation to commemorate this special day should be prepared in advance. County Magistrate Jin, upon receiving the document, immediately sent letters to various agencies, setting the meeting on (26th) tomorrow to discuss afforestation methods to facilitate implementation.</p>
<p>The Repercussions of Arresting Teahouse Patrons: The heads of the Jinshanwei and Shanyang security groups jointly led security guards to the Fengxiangpu teahouse the other day, allegedly to investigate gambling and opium. Nine teahouse patrons were arrested. After some pleading, they were released on the spot for eighty yuan, resulting in Wang Dashun and others who were trying to mediate were also injured. This case has caused a stir in the local community. Yao Songsheng, the former head of the Jinshanwei security group, went to the county to file a complaint and has been instructed to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>Three Kidnappers Executed by Firing Squad: Lu Hefu, Tao Awu, and Li Jinheshang, villagers of Yekucun Township in Qingpu County, were kidnapped by bandits and held for ransom on October 17th of last year. The Second Team of the First District of the Provincial Public Security Bureau stationed in Qingpu arrested six kidnappers in the case: Chen Youliang, Hu Rongqin (also known as Shen Rongqin), Wu Fuchang, Zhang Liansheng, Wang Xiangqin, and Tang Yuxing. They were handed over to the county court for trial. Except for Zhang Liansheng, Tang Yuxing, and Wang Xiangqin, whose circumstances were relatively minor and were handled separately, Chen Youliang, Hu Rongqin, and Wu Fuchang all confessed without denial. County Magistrate Shen Yong proposed the death penalty, which was approved by the provincial government. County Magistrate Shen then tied up the three bandits Chen Youliang and others at 8:00 AM on the 24th and took them to the execution ground to be executed by firing squad.</p>
<p>Female Student Advocates for Small Families: A certain Shi in a town in Qingpu County has two daughters. The elder daughter, Ji Hua, is twenty years old and quite beautiful. She used to study at a girls' school in Shanghai. Her parents are very fond of her. Last year, a relative, Shen, acted as a matchmaker and arranged for her to marry a wealthy Zhou family in a village. Just as the betrothal gifts were being negotiated, the daughter suddenly refused and asked her father to cancel the marriage. The father had no choice but to agree, apologized to the matchmaker, and called it off. Then, in July of last year, the daughter's uncle acted as a matchmaker and arranged for her to marry the son of a wealthy gentleman, Qian, in a town. The daughter agreed, so the betrothal gifts were exchanged in October. Qian has now chosen a date in March for the wedding. When Shi heard about it, he prepared a dowry for his daughter. Unexpectedly, the daughter suddenly put forward a condition, saying that the wedding must be held in Shanghai, and after the wedding, she must live in Shanghai and start a small family, unwilling to live with her parents-in-law. Qian did not agree and asked someone to negotiate with Shi, but the daughter insisted on this point. If it was not allowed, she would rather dissolve the marriage. However, Shi's face was at stake, and he repeatedly persuaded his daughter, but the daughter's will was firm, so disagreements between father and daughter have occurred from time to time. It is not known how to resolve the matter.</p>
<p>Another Pair of Star-Crossed Lovers Arrested: A villager named Zhai in Lao Wu Jing Township in Qingpu County has a wife, Shou, who is thirty-one years old. They have been married for thirteen years and their relationship is very deep. They have two sons and a daughter. Shou has a cousin, Chen, who is over forty years old and not yet married. He has an affair with Shou. Her husband occasionally saw them, but he did not suspect anything as they were close relatives. However, his daughter, Su Lan, discovered the truth and told her father. Although Zhai was angry, he did not want to make a fuss since his children were grown up, and only advised her secretly. Unexpectedly, Shou became angry out of shame and slapped her husband, accusing him of ruining her reputation. Since Zhai had no evidence, he apologized and made amends to make peace. After a few days, Zhai pretended to go out boating, but actually stayed in a teahouse to drink tea. He instructed his daughter to track Chen's whereabouts. After seeing her husband go out, Shou summoned Chen again for pleasure. Su Lan secretly told her father, who rushed home, broke down the door, and captured them both, shouting, "Catch the thieves!" Neighbors heard the sound and came, and Chen was sent to the township chief, requesting severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Yuan Miao Temple to be Rebuilt into Central Market: Qian Street is the center of Suzhou, and the most commercially prosperous area. The municipal government is preparing to widen it, and the citizens have organized a road construction association to carry out the work. The Yuan Miao Temple in that area is a scenic spot. Now, three Shanghai merchants, including one named Gu, are planning to rebuild the front gate of Yuan Miao Temple into a central market. The area is about 168 square feet, and more than 100 four-story steel-framed foreign-style buildings will be constructed, with an estimated construction cost of 100,000 yuan. According to the plan, the ground floor will be for large shops, the second floor for restaurants and similar businesses, the third floor for auditoriums, hotels, and bathhouses, and the fourth floor for billiard rooms, amusement parks, and movie theaters. After the completion of the project, it will be rented out. However, the land belongs to the Taoist priests of Yuan Miao Temple and is temple property, so the land will be leased from the Taoist priests to build the houses. There has already been contact with the municipal government, and construction can begin after negotiations are completed.</p>
<p>Counter-Revolutionary Criminals Escorted to Suzhou: On the 24th, the Department of Civil Affairs dispatched more than ten police officers to escort six counter-revolutionary criminals to the High Court for interrogation. The six people are Rong Jiashu, head of the first district of the Shuyang Autonomous Region; Jiang Hanqing, head of the second district; Zhang Zhaoguang, head of the third district; Sun Yuchang, head of the fourth district; Li Yaofeng, head of the seventh district; and Hu Hanxia, director of the county's Public Security Bureau. It is said that they were reported by the monks of the Huoshen Temple and the nuns of the Yanshou Convent in the county, who claimed that the six had suspected reactionary activities and were holding meetings in the convent, plotting something untoward.</p>
<p>High Court Examines Prison Guards: Due to the overcrowding of prisoners in various districts, the president of the High Court, Lin, built a temporary detention center outside Panmen at the old arsenal, which will be completed within days. Therefore, on the 1st of this month, he recruited prison guards and scheduled the examination for yesterday (the 25th). A total of 127 people registered, and 64 people came to the court for the examination. The examination subjects were: (1) testing eyesight, (2) written test of general literacy, and (3) testing physical strength. Thirty people were selected, and ten were put on the waiting list. They will report to the court on March 1st and be sent to the Third Sub-Prison on Siqian Street for training. After the detention center is completed, they will go to work.</p>
<p>High Court Transfers Prison Officials: President Lin of the High Court approved the resignation of Liu Weilin, a prison official from Yangzhong County Prison, due to illness. The vacancy was filled by Chen Qingya, an official from the Wuxi Detention Branch. The Wuxi vacancy was filled by Wang Nianci, an official from the Fengxian County Detention Branch, and the Fengxian vacancy was filled by Xu Zhongtao.</p>
<p>Water Police Raid Lake Bandits: Wei Jing Tang and Wu Shen Jing outside Qimen were robbed by bandits on the same day. It is now known that the leader of the bandits is indeed Jiang Si Lao Ban (i.e., Jiang Asi). Yesterday (the 25th), the county government received a report from the Tian Cong District Office that eight or nine bandit ships were found near the Shuangmiao Port Sanguantang in Xiangcheng Luxiangwen. More than 100 bandits were found two miles northeast of the Hongmiao Temple on Zhiyang Cheng Lake, where Wu Dajin, a major Taihu bandit, was entrenched. At the same time, the County Public Security Bureau received a report from Chen Bojiu and Huang Hong, leaders of the water patrol team of the police brigade, that they had been ordered to investigate the bandits on the night of the 24th. They immediately took a car to Weiting and hired</p>
<p>a small boat, disguised as farmers, and bought more than ten kilograms of green vegetables to load on the boat to investigate Yangcheng Lake. That night, they met the helmsman of the Fifth Ship of the Eleventh Water Police Team, who had gone missing when Wei Jing Tang was robbed. He said that the bandits were still in Yangcheng Lake and were planning to rob ships. On the morning of the 24th, three bandit ships contacted the Eleventh Water Police Team between Xiangcheng and Tian Jing. Now, ten patrol boats of the Eleventh Team are guarding the railway bridge, and the Zhenwei warship is towing ten patrol boats of the guerrilla team to search and suppress the lake.</p>

<p>Robbery of a Grain Boat in Gezhuang: He Quanfu, a grain merchant in Gezhuang outside Xiaodongmen, loaded 166 stones of white rice on the 21st to sell in Shanghai. That night, the rice boat was docked at the Gezhuang River Wharf, intending to set sail the next day. Unexpectedly, at about 1:00 am that night, two boats resembling fishing boats sailed over and docked beside the rice boat. Then, more than 20 bandits from the fishing boats swarmed onto the rice boat, tied up the five crew members, and locked them in the stern cabin. They then proceeded to rob the boat, escaping towards Kuncheng Lake in the original boats. Afterwards, the victim checked the losses and found that 26 stones and 2 dou of white rice, 16 silver dollars, 18,000 copper coins, 5 cotton quilts, and more than 30 pieces of clothing had been robbed.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Eight-County and City Product Exhibition to be Held: In order to promote the products of various counties and cities, Sun Zuji, the magistrate of this county, initiated the Eight-County and City Product Exhibition. It is stipulated that the first week will be held in Huishan, this county, and the other counties and cities will hold it in turn. Yesterday, Magistrate Sun submitted this proposal to the county government meeting for discussion and approval.

<p>Two Boats Collide, Child Drowned: The other day, Jiangbei native Ma Yongliang, along with his wife and others, was sailing</p>
<p>a boat</p>
<p>loaded with brine from Wuxi to Suzhou for sale. Unexpectedly, while passing near Wangting, a water pumping machine boat suddenly came head-on. Due to the turbulent water flow, they could not avoid it, causing the two boats to collide. The brine boat was overturned at that time, and Ma's wife, Ms. Lu's six-day-old child, was tragically drowned. Mr. and Mrs. Ma, along with the owners of the water pumping machine boat, Gu Huixiang, Su Gensi, and Zhou Fengchang, were all arrested.</p>
<p>held, sent to the county for review.</p>
<p>Actively Carrying Out County-Wide Land Registration: Sun Zuji, the magistrate of Wuxi County, and Chen Liangdong, the director of the Finance Bureau, were recently appointed by the Finance Department as the director and deputy director of the Wuxi Land Registration Office. They have appointed staff to set up an office in the east corridor of the county government and submitted it to the county government meeting for discussion and approval. The seventeen autonomous regions were ordered to set up public offices so that all industries could go to register nearby. Recently, the department ordered that the entire county must be completed within six months, so the staff of the office are stepping up their work and will distribute the registration certificates to the autonomous regions today (the 26th) for registration to be carried out immediately.</p>
<p>Dispute Over Holding Feast Donations Unresolved: Lu Renshou, director of the Education Bureau of Wuxi County, recently stated that the autonomous feast donations held by the First Autonomous Region conflicted with the education feast donations that had been passed by the meeting. It is not appropriate to have such a divergent approach in the same region. He sent a letter to Qian Zhongliang, the head of the First District, advocating that the county Education Bureau should still collect the donations and that the autonomous donations should be collected as an attachment. Subsequently, the County Education Association also sent a letter to the First District questioning it. The two sides argued, each with its own reasons. People intervened to mediate, but there was no substantial resolution. The First District believes that the autonomous feast donations held by the district are based on the provisions of the Regulations for the Implementation of Township Autonomy, decided by the township chiefs and district affairs meetings, and do not exceed the scope of autonomy. At this time when autonomy is being promoted, it is impossible to suppress legitimate public opinion and favor the other side. Therefore, it has already replied to the Education Bureau, expressing its views and insisting on implementation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>High Court Assigns Investigation of Prison: In order to investigate the implementation of prison reform, the High Court sent Secretary Yao Guozhang to Wujin County in mid-January to solicit donations and prepare for reconstruction. On the 22nd, Yao commissioned Su Zhicheng, bearing the order of the High Court, to investigate whether the guards and others had been negligent prior to the prison break on January 31st. On the 23rd, he inspected the prison, assessed the situation, planned improvements, and scheduled a meeting of various agencies and local people to discuss the measures.</p>
<p>Bandits Run Rampant in the Suburbs: The Cao Jinpei family, who run a small cloth factory in Machili, Shuangpai outside the East Gate, were visited by four bandits the other night who broke down the door and demanded 1,000 yuan. After much pleading, they demanded 500 yuan. Because there was no cash, the bandits burned down three houses with two boxes of kerosene, causing a loss of more than 3,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Headquarters Secretly Arrests Suspected Reactionaries: Magistrate Shen, upon the order of the Department of Civil Affairs, transferred the secret order of the General Headquarters, according to Zhang Xirui, Xu Ruiwen, and Zhang Yi (who does not exist) of Changjing Township, Jiangyin, accusing Bao Hansheng, Wang Yanbin, Zhang Lianfang, Gu Di, and others of colluding with the Big Knife Society to transport firearms for lake bandits and bribing prison guard Liu to help prisoners escape. They should be arrested immediately. Magistrate Shen secretly ordered Cai Sheping, the inspector of the Public Security Bureau, to go to the countryside to summon the plaintiff and defendant to the city. On the night of the 24th, after questioning by Director Zhang, Bao Hansheng and others claimed to be unaware of the matter and had always been law-abiding. The plaintiff also denied making any accusations, claiming that it was a completely fabricated slander. More than 30 reputable businesses in Changjing</p>
<p>Provided proof and guaranteed their innocence. After questioning, Director Zhang believed that the case was beyond his jurisdiction and submitted it to the county government for review.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Monks Also Develop Official Ambitions: Director Miao of the Department of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province was inspecting outside the South Gate yesterday. When he arrived at Zhulin Temple, a young man in a Western suit suddenly came to Miao to complain, saying that he was originally a monk, with the secular name of Lu Zhiying. Some time ago, he met a graduate of a certain military academy, who claimed to have the ability to get a job. He believed it to be true at the time, changed his clothes, and gradually spent more than 1,200 yuan on job placement fees, but there has been no news. He asked for an investigation. Miao believed that the person deceived by the monk was obviously defrauding him of money, so he took the monk back into custody and sent him to the relief home for strict supervision this morning. He also investigated the defrauder for review.</p>
<p>Jurong Public Security Bureau Chief Escorted to the Province: Zeng Guangyu, chief of the Jurong County Public Security Bureau, was found to have violated the law by privately establishing an automobile company and openly operating it. The provincial government decided to hand it over to the Department of Civil Affairs for investigation. Yesterday, the Department sent someone to escort him to the province, where he is currently held in the Department, awaiting disposal.</p>
<p>Change of County Police Captain: Zhang Peifu, captain of the Zhenjiang County Police, was ordered by the Department of Civil Affairs to be appointed elsewhere. Ma Qingfeng has been appointed to replace him. Zhang and Ma have both completed the handover.</p>
<p>City God Temple to be Rebuilt into Public Entertainment Venue: The county party headquarters received a report from the party headquarters of the First District, stating that the City God Temple is the main base of superstition. During this period of political tutelage, to enlighten the people's wisdom, it is necessary to break down superstition and make good use of waste by rebuilding it into a public entertainment venue. After receiving the report, the department sent a letter to the Provincial Construction Committee yesterday, requesting that it be rebuilt immediately to eliminate superstition and benefit the public.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Jiahu Ferry Boat Robbed: The Zhao Shang Tong Yuan Cooperation Company's Jiahu auxiliary motorboats, Feixiang and Feilong, were robbed last winter. After Feixiang was robbed, the company requested the Water Police Bureau to send patrol boats from the Thirteenth Team to escort them. Yesterday (the 24th), after Feilong connected with the Shanghai-Hangzhou buses in Jiaxing, it set sail for Huzhou. After passing Wuzhen, at 4:30 pm, when it reached Yaodun Yang River, halfway between Qifengtang Bridge and Tuoxi, three bandits had already disguised themselves as villagers from Wuzhen and boarded the boat. One bandit on the ferry held a pistol and forced the boat to stop. Two bandits at the stern of the tugboat held wooden-cased Browning guns and fired randomly at the escorting patrol boat. Two small boats suddenly came from both sides, carrying more than 20 bandits, who also fired at the patrol boat with various firearms. The water police fought back, but the bandits outnumbered the police. Tan Xiaodong, a water policeman, was shot four times in both hands and feet. Xia Zhengzhang tried to seize a gun from a bandit and was bitten on the finger and hit in the head five times. He was bandaged at the Shuanglin Hospital that night and his injuries were quite serious. He has been sent to the Huzhou Gospel Hospital. Eight firearms were also robbed. The water police retreated, and the bandits swarmed onto the boat</p>
<p>searching and looting the passengers, none of whom were spared. The estimated loss is more than 2,000 gold yuan. Coincidentally, Xu, the captain of the Thirteenth Team, was inspecting the defense zone in Shuanglin. At about 7:00 pm, Water Policeman Wang Yuchun reported the situation. The captain immediately sent someone to telegraph the neighboring towns to encircle and suppress the bandits, and personally led the patrol boat to pursue them. By dawn, there was no trace of them. Now, detectives have been sent out in all directions. It is said that most of the bandits are natives and are mostly wearing cloth skirts.</p>
<p>Fourth District Division Meeting: The Jiaxing County Government, because the district division matter in this county has not been resolved, convened representatives of villages and neighborhoods throughout the county at the Zhongshan Hall in the Public Sports Field yesterday and the day before yesterday for the fourth district division meeting. As a result, it was decided to divide the entire county into seven districts. However, there are two versions of the seven-district plan. One version follows the existing police district division completely, and the other version does not follow the police district and changes the division.

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>A Young Woman Commits Suicide Due to Heartbreak: Xie Guiying, a 30-year-old young woman from Guangdong, is the beloved daughter of Tan Bushao, a wealthy merchant in Shanghai. Ten years ago, she married Xie Shaogang, also from Guangdong. Xie served as the inspector of the Ningbo Municipal Public Security Bureau three years ago, and Guiying also came to Ningbo to live with him. The couple was still loving. Later, Shaogang resigned, and the couple went to Guangzhou together. Recently, Shaogang was appointed to an important position in Guangdong and took another concubine. Guiying was depressed. On the 19th of this month, Guiying and her maid went from Guangdong to Shanghai. She attempted suicide on the way, but the maid persuaded her to stop. After arriving in Shanghai, she lived with her mother's family. Her father promised to give her 200,000 gold yuan in the future as lifelong maintenance expenses, but Guiying was still unable to alleviate her grief due to her husband's love. On the afternoon of the 21st, she left home under a pretext and took the Great Cabin of the Xin Ning Shao Ship No. 7 to Ningbo. When the ship set anchor, Yan covered the door of the room and hanged herself with electrical wire. She left two notes, one to her father, which simply said (I am forced by the world to do this, I will repay you in the next life) with the words "Your daughter Guiying bows goodbye" at the bottom. The other note was to the shipowner, which said (Please send the four items I left behind to No. 115 Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, Shanghai. Leave 25 yuan in banknotes, 15 yuan to the tea boy as a delivery fee, and the other 10 yuan also to the tea boy). The next morning, after the ship arrived at the port, it was discovered that the woman had hanged herself. The body was moved to the shore and placed in a shed built on the pier. The court was reported for inspection and a telegram was urgently sent to Shanghai to notify the family. Her father searched everywhere after Guiying disappeared. The next day at noon, he received a telegram from Ningbo and learned of the matter. He immediately ordered her husband's nephew, Jie Min, and cousin Yu, etc., to take the Ningxing ship to Ningbo to handle the aftermath. The coffin will be generously prepared today and transported back to Shanghai.</p>

<p>French Government Investigates Chinese Language</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a report from Gao Lu, our country's envoy to France, which was transferred by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday. The French government will send Mr. Mai Guli to China to investigate our country's education. His biggest task is the issue of the Chinese language and characters. Because Mr. Mai has been teaching Chinese characters in France for many years, the students he teaches cannot be understood by the Chinese people when they speak Chinese. Therefore, he came to investigate the reasons why it is not easy for people to understand and will write a book based on the investigation results to make it easier for the French to learn.</p>

<h3>National Games</h3>
<p>(1) Continued Appointment of Consultants</p>
<p>The National Games is the first of its kind in our country, with a grand scale, and attracts attention both at home and abroad. The responsibility is heavy, and we should gather ideas and benefit from others' experiences.

<p>(2) Reasons for Not Including Ping Pong in the Program</p>
<p>Because it is not an Outdoor Sport</p>
<p>Reply to the National Ping Pong Federation</p>
<p>The opening date of this National Games is quite close to the 9th Far Eastern Games, almost seamlessly connected. The National Amateur Athletic Federation has specially requested the federation to pre-select athletes. Chairman Yu Binqi and others of the National Ping Pong Federation requested to include ping pong, as it is a Far Eastern Games program. The federation believed that it was not an outdoor sport and could not be included. A reply was sent yesterday. The two letters are recorded as follows: Letter from the National Ping Pong Federation, Gentlemen, I have read the newspaper and learned that your association promotes sports and cultivates healthy citizens, and has scheduled the National Games to be held in Hangzhou on April 1. I am very impressed. However, among the sports categories, ping pong is the only one missing. I think that after ping pong was commended by the British Emperor in 1800, all countries in the world have promoted it. It started in our country in the first year of the Republic of China. It was first tested in Shanghai. The YMCA has been popular throughout the country for several years. It participated in the 8th Far Eastern Games in the 16th year of the Republic of China. It is suitable for both old and young, and is the most suitable sport for indoors. And in the 9th Far Eastern Games, there will definitely be championship games in the future. Therefore, I hope that this National Games will not miss this item, and I hope you will strongly promote it. Sincerely, Yu Binqi, Chairman of the National Ping Pong Federation. The federation's reply stated, Gentlemen, I received your letter of the 23rd of this month, and I am glad to learn about it. This association is promoting outdoor sports. Ping pong is an indoor sport. The National Games has nothing to do with the Far Eastern Games. However, it happens to be the time of the Far Eastern Games, and the National Amateur Athletic Federation is using this association for pre-selection only. I am very sorry for the inconvenience. I hope you will understand. Sincerely, Committee of the Chinese Ping Pong Federation.</p>
<p>(3) Venue Loaned to Zhejiang Provincial Games</p>
<p>This National Games is convened by provinces separately. Each province has already held the provincial games first to produce athletes to join. The Zhejiang Provincial Games has been actively prepared and is scheduled to be held on March 16, 17, and 18. Yesterday, the Zhejiang Education Department borrowed the venue and sports equipment from the National Games. The association approved the letter and has agreed to lend it.</p>
<p>(4) Postal and Telecommunications Equipment at the Venue</p>
<p>The National Games Preparatory Office moved from Ziyou Ma Po Lane to the Meidong Gaoqiao venue to work. Because the location is remote, it is difficult to publicize the news and to send letters and telegrams to visiting groups and guests. Yesterday, it specially sent letters to the Postal Administration, requesting to install temporary mailboxes in the venue to facilitate delivery. On the one hand, it also sent letters to the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau to install an extension machine to facilitate communication and avoid isolation.</p>
<p>(5) Opening the Sixth Staff Meeting</p>
<p>All the staff of the Games Preparatory Office held the sixth staff meeting at the office at 2:00 PM yesterday (25th) to exchange opinions and connect work. It is heard that the discussion was about the progress of various important tasks and the planning of future work implementation guidelines.</p>
<p>(6) Accommodation for Athletes</p>
<p>The first meeting of the Games Preparatory Office decided to use the original houses in the Meidong Gaoqiao Dayingpan as the office of the Games and the accommodation for athletes from various provinces.

Therefore, the Games is currently trying to rent the accommodation locations for athletes from various provinces.</p>

<h3>Report on the Newspaper Industry Football Championship</h3>
<p>Xinwen Team Defeats Shenbao Team 3-1</p>
<p>The second round of the Shanghai Newspaper Industry Union Championship, originally scheduled for last Thursday, was postponed to yesterday due to the referee's absence. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the athletes from both sides, full of energy, took to the field. The Xin team's forwards immediately pressed the Shen team's goal. An occasional lapse in concentration by the Shen team's center-back led to him kicking the ball into his own net. The goalkeeper was unable to defend it, and the ball went in. The Xin team, with the wind at their back, continued to attack the goal. Fortunately, the Shen team's defense was effective, and they prevented any further goals. The first half ended with a score of 1-0. After switching sides, the Shen team made a concerted effort to counterattack, but their luck was lacking, and they were repeatedly unsuccessful. Later, the Shen team's right forward received a pass from the right wing and scored a goal, creating a 1-1 tie. At this point, both sides fought bravely, hoping to secure the final victory. However, within a few minutes, the Xin team scored again. The Shen team, feeling demoralized, had a slight disruption in their formation. In the last four minutes, the Shen team conceded another goal. The final score was 3-1, with the Xin team winning. The referee was Mr. Jiang Xiangqing.</p>

<h3>Telegram Requesting Japanese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Not Be Treated as Reciprocal Items</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Chinese Cotton Mill Association to the Government</p>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Mill Association, regarding the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement, sent a telegram yesterday to the President of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of Finance, and the Minister of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing, stating: "News reports indicate that the Sino-Japanese tariff treaty is about to be signed, and the reciprocal agreement within it involves exchanging raw materials for finished products. The implications of this are extremely significant. Reciprocity must involve mutual benefit to be considered as such. For example, yarn and cloth are major Japanese imports, and their quantity is so large that the total value of Chinese products exported to Japan may not be sufficient to match it. To speak of reciprocity in this context is akin to cutting oneself with a knife, leading to the demise of the entire Chinese yarn and cloth industry. We earnestly request that you consider the infancy of our industry and the impoverishment of our people and ensure that Japanese-made cotton yarn and cloth are not treated as reciprocal items. We also request that the full text of the agreement be disclosed in advance for public review. We await your urgent response. The Chinese Cotton Mill Association respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun to Return to Shanghai Soon</h3>

According to Municipal Government sources, Deputy Adjutant Li's father boarded a ship yesterday to travel to the capital of Fujian Province.</p>

The Danish residents of this city are preparing a grand welcome.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Executive Committee Warns Yan Xishan</h3>
<p>Since Mr. Yan Xishan sent a telegram, the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee sent a telegram that day to inquire about the truth of the telegram. Having received no reply, they sent another telegram on the following day with advice and suggested three ways out, hoping he would choose one. After receiving this telegram, Yan replied by telegram on the following day, but his response was evasive and did not address the question. In order to encourage him to correct his mistakes and start anew, they sent another direct telegram to Yan yesterday, offering final sincere words and issuing a preliminary warning. The original telegram stated: "National emergency, urgent! To Mr. Yan Baichuan of Taiyuan, please take heed! Reading your telegram, we cannot help but feel saddened by your confusion and loss of direction. Since your telegram, your remarks have been inconsistent, your positions strange, and your arguments contradictory. In our telegram, we offered sincere advice, but your reply completely ignored the three options we suggested, focusing solely on the organization of the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. Your evasiveness is clear. However, if you still value the party, we must inform you that the National Congress is the highest authority within the party, a fact that you acknowledge. Your dissatisfaction lies only in the selection and appointment of some representatives to the Third Plenary Session. Therefore, you seek to deny it as the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session. Regardless of whether your calculations regarding the number of people are accurate, your statements today are tantamount to rebelling against the party. Why? Because the so-called selection is done by the Central Committee from a list of twice the number of representatives elected by local party headquarters. Those selected are still representatives elected by party members from various locations. How is this different from purely elected representatives? This is the first point. As for party members in provinces where formal party headquarters have not yet been established, registration is still underway, making direct elections difficult. Following the precedent set by the First and Second National Congresses, the Central Committee appointed representatives. What is wrong with that? This is the second point. Since the purge of the Communist Party in 1927, it has been necessary to both eliminate communist elements and prevent reactionary elements from infiltrating. Consolidating party affairs is a crucial task in strengthening the party's foundation. The Third Plenary Session has been postponed repeatedly, almost for three years. With the commencement of political tutelage, further delays are unacceptable. To prevent reactionary elements from using elections as a guise to infiltrate and pose as representatives in provinces where party headquarters have not yet been formally established, the Central Committee carefully selected representatives to ensure that the National Congress could convene as scheduled, meeting the needs of consolidating the party's foundation and leading political tutelage. This is the third point. Moreover, the method of selection and appointment was decided by the Central Standing Committee, and the individuals selected and appointed were also approved by the Central Standing Committee. This Central Standing Committee is the Standing Committee of the Second Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang, not the Central Standing Committee of one person. Therefore, the organization of the Third Plenary Session does not involve one person appointing more than half of the representatives. Your words are baseless. This is the fourth point. Furthermore, according to the party's charter, the Central Standing Committee has the power to perform duties during the recess of the Central Committee, and the Central Committee is the highest authority during the recess of the National Congress. Therefore, the organization law and election law for the Third Plenary Session passed by the Central Standing Committee are the rules and regulations established by the party's highest authority. Convening the National Congress based on these rules and regulations naturally makes it a legitimate Third Plenary Session. This is the fifth point. In summary, we can state unequivocally that the Third Plenary Session that convened in the capital on March 15 last year was the Kuomintang's Third Plenary Session. With the premise established, what more can you say about 'those comrades who condemn me, I admit all'? Moreover, your telegram only parrots the words of the Reorganization Faction. The Reorganization Faction betrayed the party and harmed the country, something you once detested. You launched expeditions from Fenglingdu to punish Feng and from Zhengzhou to punish Tang. Your resolute acceptance of the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to support the Central Government stemmed from your opposition to the Reorganization Faction. Now, for the sake of personal gain, you abandon your position and repeat the Reorganization Faction's traitorous rhetoric, claiming to protect the party. If this is how you protect the party, then from Zhang Fakui to Li Bai and Feng Tang, all claimed to protect the party. Why did you follow the Central Government to suppress them? We fear that the Reorganization Faction will laugh at your inconsistency and be ashamed to associate with you. This is one instance of your confusion and loss of direction. You are deliberately opposing the legally convened Third Plenary Session. Why did we not hear a word from you before the Third Plenary Session convened? Your close associates accepted appointments from the Central Committee and attended the session, and we never heard you object. You were elected as a Central Executive Committee member at the Third Plenary Session, and we never heard you decline. You accepted prestigious titles conferred upon you by the National Government appointed by the party, and we never saw you refuse to take office. Now, misled by petty people, you openly rebel against the party, deny the legitimacy of the Third Plenary Session, and seek to unite the Third Central Committee to decide party affairs. Do you not know that if the Third Plenary Session is denied, the Third Central Committee will have nothing to rely on, and your proposal will be fundamentally untenable, plunging the Kuomintang into a state of paralysis? Your intentions are not only to betray the party but also to destroy it. If you have a sinister plot, then destroy the party if you must, but why pretend to be righteous and claim to protect the party, as if you no longer know the meaning of shame? This is another instance of your confusion and loss of direction. In short, for the past eighteen years, you have been the local emperor of Shanxi, skilled in the art of duplicity, and you have not known the nation, let alone the party. Since your telegram, in less than two weeks, your true colors of harming the party and disrupting the nation have been fully revealed. The reason we have repeatedly offered sincere advice is that we still hope you will pull back from the brink, correct your mistakes, and start anew. If you remain unrepentant, believing yourself to be the most cunning person in the world, and insist on betraying the party and the nation, harming the people without regret, then we will have no choice but to request the Central Government to suppress the rebellion and will no longer resent you. The Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang."</p>
<h3>Hope for Tax Reduction on Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Transmits Opinions of Tea Merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, recognizing the decline of Chinese tea trade, the impoverishment of tea workers, and the widespread unemployment, which is detrimental to the nation and society, prepared ten measures to rescue Chinese tea and submitted them to the Municipal Government for referral to the Executive Yuan for review. Among them, regarding the tax reduction item, the Ministry of Finance has drafted three types of tax reduction measures. After receiving the order, the Bureau has instructed the Shanghai Tea Guild and the Shanghai Tea Merchants Association to take note, review, and reply. It is now reported that both the Tea Guild and the Tea Merchants Association have drafted opinions and submitted them successively. The Bureau is forwarding them to the Municipal Government for submission to the Executive Yuan for adoption and implementation. The original submission states: "In accordance with Order No. 2486, the Executive Yuan ordered the referral of three draft tax reduction measures by the Ministry of Finance regarding the rescue of Chinese tea and instructed the Shanghai Tea Guild to take note. After copying the three original measures, the Shanghai Tea Guild and the Shanghai Tea Merchants Association were instructed to take note. Subsequently, the Shanghai Tea Guild replied, stating that they did not fully understand the draft tax reduction measures prepared by the Ministry of Finance and requested an explanation. After providing a detailed explanation, the Guild replied, stating that after carefully examining the draft tax reduction measures prepared by the Ministry of Finance, they found that Clause C, which refers to exports, applies to the foreign tea of the Guild and exempts them from all inland taxes and export duties. This is what the Guild has repeatedly requested and has been approved by the Ministry of Finance, pending approval by the National Tariff Commission for promulgation. They are extremely grateful. They also request that the Ministry of Finance strictly order the finance departments of all provinces not to establish separate items after the method of full exemption of export duties on Chinese tea is determined. They are deeply grateful. The Shanghai Tea Merchants Association also replied, stating: (1) Of the three draft tax reduction measures prepared by the Ministry of Finance, Measure B is the most appropriate. However, Clause A, which states that the tax rate is 3% regardless of the quality of the goods, seems too broad. The quality of tea leaves varies greatly, with prices ranging from over 100 yuan per dan to only 12 or 13 yuan per dan. If they could be divided into four grades—high-grade tea, mid-grade tea, low-grade tea, and tea stems and tea dust—with taxes of 1 yuan per dan for high-grade tea, 5 jiao for mid-grade tea, 2.5 jiao for low-grade tea, and 1 jiao for tea stems and tea dust, it would be most in line with commercial practices. (2) Tea merchants hope that the raw tea sold domestically will be subject to a special consumption tax once in the producing province and that it can be released in all provinces domestically based on the receipt, without difficulties along the way. Furthermore, the impact of competition from Indian, Ceylonese, and Japanese teas has led to a daily decrease in exports. The reason, as stated by the late Premier, is due to the increase in costs due to excessive taxes and poor cultivation methods. Now that the government has measures to reduce tea taxes, which will reduce costs, it is a good policy. However, for the sake of the future development of Chinese tea, we still request that one-half of the tax revenue in the new tariff be allocated and managed by a Central Tea Industry Committee composed of government officials and tea merchant experts to handle tea industry improvement matters or establish a tea industry bank, so that there is hope for the revitalization of Chinese tea. Based on the above reports, the proposal submitted by the Tea Guild is based on the third item of the measures proposed by the Ministry of Finance and requests a full exemption from 50% of inland taxes for exports. The proposal submitted by the Tea Merchants Association supports both items A and B, requesting a reduction in taxes on raw tea sold domestically and a collection based on the grade of tea leaves. Each is based on a subjective viewpoint and seems to be somewhat adoptable. Tea is an important product of our country. Exported boxed tea should be encouraged, while raw tea is the raw material for producing foreign tea and should also be subject to a reduction in taxes to reduce costs. However, the fundamental solution lies in improving the quality of tea leaves to remain competitive. We can refer to the report submitted by the Tea Merchants Association and the measures in the Bureau's previous report on the reorganization of Chinese tea and propose that the Executive Yuan order all tea-producing provinces to allocate half of the tea tax revenue or continue to collect half of the special consumption tax on foreign boxed tea to be used for tea industry improvement expenses. The relevant departments of the government and the competent authorities of the tea-producing provinces or tea-selling markets and tea industry experts should organize a Central Tea Industry Committee to handle tea industry improvement and promotion matters. Based on the foregoing reasons, all the circumstances reported by the Shanghai Tea Guild and the Shanghai Tea Merchants Association, as well as the Bureau's proposed reasons, are hereby submitted for your review and approval to alleviate commercial difficulties and maintain the tea industry, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Sends Personnel to Shanghai to Learn Silk Testing</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Provincial Department of Construction's Provincial Bureau for the Improvement of Sericulture and Silk Industry noted that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Silk Testing Department has been established and that all equipment is state-of-the-art. It has selected technician Feng Shengkun to come to Shanghai to study the testing procedures at the Bureau and has brought two types of sample silk, four skeins each, to be tested by the Bureau. Guangdong silk factories use the composite twisting method for silk production, which is difficult and costly. Each factory loses approximately 5,000 to 8,000 yuan per year. There are over 140 silk factories in Guangdong Province, with a total annual loss of over 800,000 yuan. The Guangdong Provincial Bureau for the Improvement of Sericulture and Silk Industry, in order to recover this loss, plans to encourage the province's silk factories to switch to the single twisting method used by silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, the factories are constrained by habit and worry that changing the production method will affect the quality of the silk and affect their credibility in foreign trade, so they are mostly waiting and watching. Now, the director of the Bureau for the Improvement of Sericulture and Silk Industry plans to conduct in-depth research on this issue to ensure that the silk quality is not affected by the change in production method. If there is a way to prove this point to the factories, then changing the silk production method in Guangdong's silk factories will be easily resolved. Therefore, eight skeins of sample silk have been sent to the Bureau for research to achieve this goal. The Bureau believes that improving sericulture and silk industry is a noble intention and is happy to support it. Technician Feng has already arrived at the Shanghai Bureau, and the sample silk he brought has been sent to the Bureau, which has begun researching methods to improve silk production.</p>
<h3>Members of the United Chinese Association Welcome the British Consul-General</h3>
<p>The British Consul-General Gives a Very Sincere Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xiaoyun and other members of the Shanghai United Chinese Association hosted a luncheon yesterday for the new British Consul-General, Mr. J.F. Brenan. Present were President Xu of the Provisional Court, Judge Ge, Judge Yang, Pan Chengbo, Yu Hongjun, and other Chinese and foreign guests, totaling over seventy people. Mr. Wilson of Gonghe Yanghang, a member of the Association, presided over the meeting and delivered a welcome speech, stating that they were deeply honored that Mr. Brenan, who had previously served as Vice-Consul in Shanghai and was a member of the Association, had been appointed Consul-General. Consul-General Brenan rose to deliver a reply, which Mr. Zhang Xiaoyun translated, and the audience applauded. A group photo was taken, and the gathering ended at two o'clock. The speech of Consul-General Brenan is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Four years ago, when I left Shanghai, I was honored by a banquet hosted by the gentlemen of your Association and my old friend Mr. Zhang, where we enjoyed several hours of conversation. Recalling the past, it feels like yesterday. Today, I am again honored to be hosted by you at this gathering, which further increases my sense of honor. During these four years, the situation has been turbulent and has undergone great changes. While you have been in Shanghai, I have been in South China, witnessing these major political events, some of which have had frightening consequences, while others have been inspiring. The great nation, which has been through this turmoil, is now striving under the guidance of a single party and a single government, hoping to complete its unification. In the future, this struggle may continue for some time, and you and I, as guests in this country, may still be swept up by the whirlwind of overwhelming force, unable to extricate ourselves, or we may, as we sincerely hope, forever lay down arms and allow the national government recognized by the great powers to focus wholeheartedly on using national resources to implement its ambitious plans for construction and reform. It is impossible to know. Today, many of you present are prominent Chinese figures in Shanghai, leaders in the banking and commercial sectors. I would like to take this opportunity to express what I have wanted to say in my heart since arriving in Shanghai, representing the expatriate community of my country: The Chinese and British peoples have known each other for a long time, and the commercial and cultural relations between them have benefited both. Both great peoples share many common characteristics. The Chinese people are skilled in business and known for their honest transactions. The British people also often regard merchants as the backbone of the country and pride themselves on their reputation and behavior. Although both great peoples are slightly boastful, they are both equipped with common sense and are willing to accept reasonable solutions to resolve disputes. More importantly, there are no conflicting political goals between the two peoples. This is especially true in Shanghai. The International Settlement is a place where expatriates from all countries live together, not just a British settlement. However, the British are the majority. I can assure you that all responsible British officials share the same aspirations for the Settlement as you: to maintain good governance so that the safety of your and our expatriate communities' vast properties is always guaranteed, and to serve as a major base for the flow of Chinese and foreign business and wealth. Those of us who can look to the future all know that the management of the International Settlement will gradually transition into Chinese hands. The Municipal Council has already hired expert Mr. Feitang to investigate, research, and devise plans, hoping to open a smooth path towards this change. This is something you know. However, I am afraid that future calls for political change will cause the pace of progress to be too rapid and exceed the safety threshold. This is why I want to say to you that for the sake of your own interests and the interests of foreign merchants, please do your best to reconcile the various demands for rapid change from radical factions. In the past, Chinese people who owned property in the Settlement often relied on foreign forces to protect their property, but there will come a day when this trend is reversed. We expatriates will rely on you to maintain the local law and order and clean government."</p>
<h3>City Government Announces Temporary Regulations for the Public Safety Bureau's Handling of Passport Registration and Visa Endorsements</h3>
<p>Temporary Regulations</p>
<p>The city government yesterday sent a letter to the consulates of various countries, stating: "To Whom It May Concern: Following the abolition of the Jiangsu Foreign Affairs Commissioner's Office, all foreign affairs matters have been taken over by this government, which has instructed the Public Safety Bureau to continue handling them, as duly noted in previous communications.

<h3>Important Shipping News</h3>
<p>Chinese Ships Maintain Commercial Transport: Shanghai merchants are deeply distressed by the fact that transportation rights have fallen entirely into the hands of foreign merchants, who are oppressing them. They have requested that Chinese merchants quickly open Yangtze River routes to maintain transportation. The Sanbei Company is only capable in spirit. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is making an effort because some customers have pre-paid freight tickets. It was decided that, starting tomorrow, the foreign ship "Xinfeng" will be transferred to the Yangtze River route and the Shipping Department has been requested to protect it.</p>

<p>The Guangda's Dispute Yesterday: The China Merchant Steam Navigation Company's "Guangda" was cleared yesterday and is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Guangzhou this morning. There was a large amount of cargo shipped from Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, while passengers and cargo were boarding, the ship suddenly experienced a work stoppage dispute. It was because the cargo manager refused to work due to salary arrears. Thousands of passengers and cargo were stranded at the dock for a time. Merchants flocked to the general office to inquire. The office sent the salaries to the ship, and the dispute was resolved. However, it had been delayed for several hours. The ship was working overnight to load the ship and is scheduled to leave at 10 AM this morning.</p>

<h3>Request to Waive Supplementary Ship Tax</h3>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Petition to the City Government</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the city government: "To Whom It May Concern: On the 21st of this month, the Shanghai Siming Coal and Stone Transportation Boat Owners Association stated in a letter that recently, members reported to the association that when their boats arrived at Dongjiadu and Xinzha Bridge to register, in addition to paying the registration fee of three yuan per boat, the ship registration office and the finance collection office measured each boat and even detained them. When asked why, the registration office said that it was necessary to pay the ship tax for the three months from November of last year to January of this year. Members told them that the tax had been collected by the tax merchants, but they did not respond and demanded the tax certificate or the tax amount according to the current measurement, and they asked to make up for three months of tax. In view of this, this tax was collected by the tax merchant from November last year to January this year, and the boat merchant is free from the obligation to pay twice. Furthermore, it was allowed to exempt the supplementary donation in the previous conference's resolution method. Now, the ship registration office demands to make up for the payments. The sailors paid the taxes at that time. In their ignorance, they threw away the tax certificates as they paid. Also, there are (1) hard paper cards, (2) tax merchant's household registration books, and (3) the number copied on each boat to be proof that the taxes have been paid. The current tax collected is higher than before. It will be contrary to the principle of not collecting two taxes. We hereby truthfully submit this for your review and approval to instruct the bureau to check the files, and the case of allowing the exemption of the supplementary donation can be implemented, so as to avoid disputes and maintain commercial hardship. It is for the public good. Shanghai Special Municipality, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Regulations on Reorganizing the Jinghu Railway</h3>
<p>In order to ensure passenger safety and develop the railway, the Jinghu Railway Bureau specially notified all station staff yesterday: (1) Passengers without tickets are not allowed to pass through the ticket gates. Often, there are passengers without tickets on this railway's trains who take risks when the train is in motion and jump off, resulting in injuries and deaths. In order to prevent this danger, stationmasters of major stations should pay special attention to the fact that ticket collectors at each station should strictly prohibit anyone without a formal ticket from passing through the ticket gate and should not be negligent. (2) Passengers are not allowed to get off the train at the flag-raising place outside the station. If a passenger train stops outside the station to raise a flag, the on-duty ticket inspector and train captain should stop them and inform them that they can only get off the train after the train has entered the station and stopped. (3) Checking tickets on the train and verifying and collecting supplementary fees should be handled carefully according to the regulations. When checking tickets on the train, each ticket inspector should check carefully and do not be careless. If anyone is found to be riding without a ticket, they should immediately verify and collect the supplementary fare. The car section chief and the newly appointed car captains should check and supervise the ticket inspectors to carry out the work conscientiously.</p>
<h3>Registration Method for Wireless Telegraph</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Wireless General Station General Dispatch Office announced to all sectors of society: "To Whom It May Concern: Registration of wireless telegraphs should be paid for in advance from January 1, 1920. A public announcement was made in the newspaper and a grace period of two months was given to allow all sectors to notify merchants in various places. Many people have come to the station to pay according to the regulations, but there are still many people who registered with our office before but have not paid. In order to clear up the procedures, from now on, all households who have not paid the fee should handle the following matters: (1) If you have already registered with the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, you can come to our station's dispatch office with the receipt for official registration and no fee will be charged. (2) If you have not registered with the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, please bring the money to our office at 565 Laobeimen, MinGuo Road, as soon as possible for registration. (Registration is one yuan per month, or ten yuan per year.) If you still do not come to our office for official registration after the deadline, our office will not be responsible for any wrongly sent or delayed telegrams. Furthermore, our office does not send anyone outside to collect registration fees. This is a special and solemn declaration for your information."</p>

The following important cases were then discussed: (1) Committee Member Yu Qiaqing proposed a draft plan to save the industry. The committee members carefully discussed the case. All members agreed that the case was the most important at the moment and should be handled immediately. Committee Member Wang Xiaolai proposed to change "saving" to "maintaining".

(2) Discussion of the draft constitution of the Chamber of Commerce, with a total of eleven chapters and sixty articles, each article was revised and approved, and the decisions were sent to various agencies for approval and registration. (3) Committee Member Wang Yansong proposed to amend the reorganization procedure of the industry association.

Then other important cases were discussed and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>The Newspaper Workers Union Requests the Revocation of the Labor Dispute Handling Standards</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Workers Union is dissatisfied with the thirteen labor dispute handling standards of the Social Affairs Bureau and submitted a request to the city government yesterday to revoke them. The petition is excerpted below: "Petition for the Revocation of the Labor Dispute Handling Standards in order to Maintain Workers' Interests. We have read that on the 7th of this month, Shanghai newspapers reported that the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has prepared thirteen labor dispute handling standards, which have been approved by your bureau and have been forwarded to the Executive Yuan of the National Government for instructions and amendments for record. After reviewing these articles, we found that they only take care of the sole interests of the owners and deprive the workers of their welfare. We are shocked. We believe that labor disputes arise because workers demand improved treatment from their employers, or because employers do not fulfill the contracts signed by both labor and management. Therefore, if employers treat their employees well and abide by all contracts signed by both parties, various disputes can be eliminated invisibly. If disputes arise unfortunately, if our party and government authorities can stand on a fair and impartial position to judge them, then the disputes that have already arisen can be solved easily. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau wants to use a one-time solution to promulgate these thirteen labor dispute handling standards to eliminate disputes. The intention is good, but the method seems inappropriate. Because injustice will lead to cries, which is known to all. If the labor dispute is to be eliminated with an unfair handling standard, it is feared that the dispute will become worse. From then on, there will be no peaceful days between labor and management. For the sake of the future of the Party and the country, and for the safety of both labor and management, we hereby submit a special petition, requesting that these thirteen handling standards be revoked immediately, and the workers of Shanghai will be fortunate. Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Special Municipality City Government, Shanghai Newspaper Workers Union, February 23, 1920 of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Attached are six reasons for requesting the revocation of the labor dispute handling standards: (1) (Original Article 5) Contracts are only allowed to stipulate the priority employment of union members, and are not allowed to stipulate that non-members are not allowed to be hired, and similar articles. (Reason) The labor union is a group of all workers, that is, a force united by all workers to seek their own interests. All workers should be able to join actively and support it. Therefore, those who are unwilling to join the labor union organization are undoubtedly willing to destroy the organization and strength of the masses. This is the vermin in our working class, and of course cannot exist within the scope of the labor union's influence. Furthermore, the purpose of the owner's employment of employees is to buy the work of the employees. There is absolutely no relationship to whether they are members of the labor union, but it is very harmful to the labor union. Now, the handling standard stipulates that contracts are not allowed to stipulate the provision that non-members are not allowed to be hired, which seems inappropriate. This is the first reason for requesting the revocation. (2) (Original Article 6) Contracts are only allowed to stipulate that the dismissal of union members must be notified to the union first, and are not allowed to stipulate that the union must agree and similar articles. (Reason) The duty of the labor union is to protect all the interests of its workers. If the employer dismisses the workers and the labor union is not allowed to consult, then the workers have lost their due protection, and the labor union has also lost its obligation to protect the workers. And the party and government organs cannot, in accordance with the provisions of the party program to protect labor organizations and support their development, and the employer can, according to this article, unconditionally dismiss the important responsible personnel of the labor union or the workers who are enthusiastic about union affairs in the factory, and there is no difference between notification and non-notification. So why should there be this funny article in the contract? This is the second reason for requesting the revocation. (3) (Original Article 7) Contracts are not allowed to stipulate that workers who have been expelled from the union by the union must also be dismissed by the employer at the same time, and similar articles. (Reason) The labor union has disciplinary regulations in order to make the revolutionary force grand and the mass organization solid. Therefore, those who destroy the revolution, disrupt the organization, collude with the capitalist, and hinder the interests of the masses will be disciplined by the most severe discipline once they are discovered. This most severe discipline is to expel them from the union, and at the same time the employer must stop their work. Then the strength of the labor union can be consolidated, and the discipline of the labor union can be serious. This kind of fact all belongs to the occurrence between labor and labor. For the capitalist, there is absolutely no benefit or harm. For the benefit of me, the workers, it is very harmful. If this provision is carried out in practice, then from now on, the capitalists can, according to the protection of this article, buy labor thieves and running dogs to destroy the discipline and organization of the labor union, and the labor union can only let it be slaughtered due to the restrictions in the article. Therefore, the provision of this article is equivalent to dissolving the labor union. This is the third reason for requesting the revocation. (4) (Original Article 8) Contracts are not allowed to stipulate the method of general wage increase. (Reason) Stipulating the method of general wage increase in the contract is not only a major article in a contract, a major interest in a labor union, but also the most fair and appropriate thing. It can eliminate daily small disputes and reduce long-term large struggles. Now, this provision is intended to cause and expand the labor tide? I really can't figure it out. This is the fourth reason for requesting the revocation. (5) (Original Article 12) In the contract, the working hours of employees should be based on the standards set in the Special Municipality's Regulations on Employee Treatment. The business hours of the employer can be handled according to the customs of various industries. (Reason) The working hours in the general factories and stores in Shanghai are generally more than 12 hours, which exceeds the standard working hours stipulated in the Regulations on Employee Treatment. Now, if the business hours of the employer are not determined based on the working hours of the employees, then the workers will still not be able to enjoy the working hours stipulated in the Regulations on Employee Treatment. In other words, they will still have to work for more than 12 hours, which is very harmful to the interests of the workers. This is the fifth reason for requesting the revocation. (6) (Original Article 13) Wage increases should be based on the price index and the employer's recent three-year business conditions. (Reason) Increasing wages based on the price index is the most appropriate standard, but the latter, which must be based on the employer's recent three-year business conditions, directly contradicts the above. We believe that wages are like machinery and raw materials, both of which are values in a product and an indispensable capital in an enterprise, and are by no means profits outside of a product. Therefore, wages have absolutely nothing to do with capital profits and losses. This is the most common standing discussion, and it is also known to the general public. Now, the increase in wages must be based on the profits and losses of capital, which is absolutely unheard of in the customs of treating employees in the past and present, and is also unique in various countries in the East and West. For this reason, the sixth reason for requesting the revocation.</p>

The disaster relief funds in Yancheng·Fuying·have not been remitted in full. Directors Chen and He have sent telegrams urging the remittance. It is proposed to prepare to remit the payment immediately. (Resolution) First remit all the deposits of the Association, and then raise funds.</p>
<p>Jishenghui Remits Funds for Emergency Relief for the Spring Disaster in Shaanxi Province</p>
<p>The Chinese Jishenghui has recently received reports from disaster relief officials in Shaanxi Province that the spring disaster relief in Shaanxi Province is extremely urgent. In Wugong and other counties, many disaster victims are starving to death every day. They are now conducting investigations and distributing relief in the countryside. In Xi'an, Xianyang and other counties, many more disaster victims and disaster children have been received. The monthly expenditure is very large. In the disaster-stricken counties, the mass graves need to be widened, covered with soil, and increased with ash to avoid the foul air from causing epidemics, and huge sums are needed to relieve the immediate crisis. The Jishenghui remitted 20,000 yuan in Shenghao Ningbo Road Yuanji Bank's Jifeng Hou Zhen Ocean the day before yesterday, and Zhudui handed it over to the Shaanxi Province Association's Disaster Relief Office for receipt and distribution of relief to make up for the disaster.</p>
<h3>Twelve More Trolleys Will Be Added</h3>
<p>Xinzha Road Temporarily Closed for Traffic Due to Track Construction</p>
<p>Xinzha Road from Beini City Bridge to Parker Road has been renovated year by year, and the road has been widened, making it possible to rebuild a double-track road. Therefore, the Public Concession Tram Company, with the consent of the Public Works Bureau, started construction on the road last winter. At present, the section from West Factory Road to Changsha Road has been completed. However, the section between Changsha Road and Parker Road is now starting work. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, the Public Works Bureau will detour all vehicles traveling on Xinzha Road from Beini City Bridge to Parker Road, except for trolleys, such as the Route 10 bus and other vehicles, on Aveny Road, turn north on Parker Road and turn west at Jiangyuan Nongkou. According to the trolley company's plan, after the road is completed in the future, a Route 12 trolley service will be added. The route has been determined to go from Jing'an Temple Road east, to Carter Road north, to Megan Road, east on Xinzha Road, and then from Toejiao Bridge Zhejiang Road north to the boundary road of the North Railway Station. It is said that the entire road will be completed in March.</p>
<h3>Installation of Electric Lights and Telephones in Puxong Area</h3>
<p>Puxong is located in West Shanghai, and there have been no electric lights or telephones. Mr. Chen Yafu, the committee member of the area, has been approved by the Public Works Bureau and the Public Utilities Bureau to install electric lights and telephones in Puxong. It is said that the street lights in the town were electrified last week, and the citizens of the area have expressed their joy.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Plumbing Repairs</h3>
<p>Not Restricted by Water Company Agreements</p>
<p>After being registered with the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, the city's plumbing contractors pay a security deposit and enter into an agreement with the Shanghai Inner and Zhabei water companies. Subsequently, plumbing contractors like Minhua pointed out that Article 4 of the agreement states that plumbers installing water pipes and equipment for users, regardless of new installations, additions, alterations, or location, must first submit a plan and drawing of the site conditions and project to the company for inspection and approval before proceeding with the installation. This means that even minor repair work requires the company's inspection before work can begin, which is an excessive restriction that significantly impacts the business of plumbing contractors. They jointly petitioned the bureau for relief, and the bureau instructed the two water companies to review and respond. The water companies clarified that "new installation" in Article 4 refers to new installations without existing water supply, "addition" refers to adding rooms and faucets, and "alteration" refers to changing the original installation and moving the location of the water supply. These are all considered major projects. Other minor repair work, such as repairing leaks in indoor water pipes and faucets, does not require prior reporting to the company for inspection. Therefore, the contractors' complaint was a misunderstanding. It is reported that the two companies have jointly clarified the situation to the bureau.</p>
<p>Minhang Organizes a Joint Fire Brigade Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai County First District Office convened various businesses to organize the Minhang Joint Fire Brigade Association. District Chief Wu Jingqing presided over the meeting.

<h3>Xuehua Creek in Puzong District to be Dredged Soon</h3>
<p>Chen Yaofu, a Puzong Municipal Committee member, noted that the Xuehua Creek in the town had been silted up for a long time and was extremely polluted.

<h3>The Complete Truth of the Chen Tianxi Kidnapping Case Revealed</h3>
<p>The Entire Story from Ye Ahou's Mouth</p>
<p>Xu Xingan from Lujiazui Was Also Hidden There</p>
<p>The Chen Tianxi kidnapping case was completely solved by the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Detective Team at 5:00 AM the day before yesterday in Sanlintang, Pudong. The victim was rescued unharmed, and seven kidnappers, both male and female, were arrested on the spot. The details have been reported in this newspaper. However, that evening, Detective Ding Shunbao arrested the leader of the gang, Ye Ahou (aka Rui Lou), at the Jintai Hotel on Fuzhou Road. He was temporarily detained at the police station and brought to the team yesterday morning. After being interrogated by Captain Qiao, he confessed that he was 24 years old, a local resident from Sanlintang, Pudong, and had worked on Yangtze River steamers. He admitted to the entire kidnapping, including who instigated it out of spite, how he contacted people through intermediaries, how they secretly discussed it in room 18 of the Huadong Hotel on Dagou Bridge, how he gathered nine or eight people at the Yizhichun restaurant in Dongjiadu, and how he delivered letters twice for negotiation. He also confessed that on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month last year, he and eight others, with five guns, kidnapped Xu Qingzhi's son, Xingan, in Lujiazui Town, Nanhui County, Pudong. After the kidnapping, they hid him in the same place where Chen Tianxi was hidden. The victim was ransomed on the 24th of the tenth month, and he received 550 yuan, which he spent. He was solely responsible for renting both hiding places, and the landlord was his older sister.</p>
<h3>Fire in Baoyu Lane Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Old Woman Pei Pan Dies in the Flames</p>
<p>Several People Slightly Injured and Seek Treatment at the Hospital</p>
<p>A fire broke out suddenly at 8:28 AM yesterday in Cao Rongji Tailor Shop, No. 39, Alley 1, Baoyu Lane, Dongxin Bridge Street, French Concession. The flames quickly rose, and the fire was uncontrollable. The fire brigade's lookout tower spotted it and quickly dispatched several pump trucks to put out the fire. However, the sparks had already spread to the adjacent No. 38 Song Yanfu Doctor's residence and the upper floors of No. 40 Pinxiangchun Western Medicine Shop. At that time, old woman Pei Pan, 72 years old, who lived on the mezzanine of No. 39, was still asleep and could not be rescued, resulting in her death in the fire. Her head and face were charred beyond recognition. A young Suzhou woman, Jiang Xia, 32 years old, jumped out of the window in an attempt to escape, injuring her left foot. Her son, Lai Fang, 13 years old, suffered burns to his eyebrows and hair. The mother and son sought treatment at Renji Hospital. It took five hours to extinguish the fire, and it destroyed two buildings. Afterward, the police instructed detectives to investigate the cause of the fire and brought the fire starter to the police station for investigation. They also sent people to dig out the body from the fire scene and sent it to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for examination.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Sale of Pawn Tickets</h3>
<p>The Eight Thousand Gold Woolen Fabric Issue</p>
<p>Six Pawn Tickets Worth 4,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Sold for 400 Yuan</p>
<p>Redeeming the Original Tickets Requires 600 Yuan</p>
<p>Buyer's Clerk Assaulted</p>
<p>A man named Zhao Daren, whose identity is unknown, mortgaged 242 pieces of woolen fabric worth 8,000 gold to the Chinese Citizens Bank on Guangdong Road last year. On the 24th day of the twelfth lunar month, Yu Luqing, a local accountant at the bank, took the mortgaged woolen fabric to the Dachang Pawnshop on Guangxi Road and pawned it for 4,000 silver dollars. The pawn tickets were divided into six. Yu then offered these pawn tickets to his friend Zhuang Jihai for 400 gold. Zhuang did not have the funds due to the approaching New Year, so he introduced the tickets to Lu Ziqing, a comprador at the Renji Road Daoda Foreign Firm. Lu had previously been the president of the Chinese Citizens Bank but resigned after incurring large losses. He then became a comprador at Daoda, and was financially secure. After verifying that the mortgaged goods were valuable, he immediately purchased the tickets for 400 yuan. He planned to redeem them, so he first sent a letter to the bank. Yu Luqing, seeing that Lu wanted to redeem the tickets, rushed to the Dachang Pawnshop to report them as lost, preventing Lu from redeeming them. Yu then asked Zhuang to negotiate with Li, requesting to purchase the tickets back with funds he prepared. On February 21st of this year, Yu borrowed 400 gold from his friend Zhu Yigen and went with Zhu to the Jinlong Tobacco Company to negotiate with Zhuang again. Lu Ziqing was also invited. Lu said that when he purchased the tickets, it was difficult to transfer funds due to the end of the year. Now that the New Year had passed, it would cost 600 gold to buy the tickets back. Zhu only had 400 yuan with him, so he gave it to Lu, promising to pay the remaining 200 yuan later. The next day, Yu and Zhu went to Daoda, requesting Lu to go to the Chinese Citizens Bank to collect the funds. Lu was busy, so he sent his clerk, Tan Zitian, with the pawn tickets. Lu instructed Tan to only hand over the tickets after receiving 200 gold, fearing a trick. When they arrived at the Chinese Citizens Bank, Yu and others gathered thugs, imprisoned Tan in a room. Tan was unable to resist, and they snatched the six pawn tickets. Tan was released at 3:00 PM that day. He was terrified and went home to rest. The next morning, he reported the situation to Lu, who reported it to the General Patrol Room. The head of the patrol, Wang Chengying, detectives Zhang Yun, and Western detective Datts, accompanied the original parties to the Chinese Citizens Bank on Guangdong Road at 10:00 AM on the 24th. However, the bank was registered in Hong Kong under the British government, and they could not enter without an order from a British official. The Chinese and Western detectives waited at the bank entrance while Lu Ziqing entered the bank alone and called out Yu Luqing, who was then arrested. They then went to No. 2 Ximen Road, Taiping Bridge, to arrest Zhu Yigen, but Zhu was out and not apprehended. Yesterday morning, Yu was escorted to the Provisional Court, where Judge Zhou Xianjue held the first hearing. The plaintiff's attorney, Ye Kangfu, explained the details of the case, stating that the Chinese Citizens Bank was using its registration in Hong Kong to engage in illegal activities and should be investigated. Lu Ziqing, Zhuang Jihai, Tan Zitian, and others testified to everything. When questioned, the defendant Yu Luqing gave evasive answers, claiming that Tan voluntarily handed over the tickets. He also hired a lawyer to present the six pawn tickets as evidence and defend him. Judge Zhou ordered the defendant to pay a bail of 500 yuan and adjourned the hearing for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Abbot of Shousheng Nunnery Sues Again Over Land Deeds</h3>
<p>Unable to Pay Large Legal Fees</p>
<p>Requests to Provide Other Sufficient Guarantees</p>
<p>Abbot Dison of Shousheng Nunnery had previously sued Yang Kuihou from Huzhou for the return of the land deeds to the nunnery's property that Yang was holding. Yang claimed that he had handed the deeds to the Huzhou Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai for safekeeping and had not returned them. Dison then sued Yang in the Provisional Court. The lawsuit has been ongoing for years and remains unresolved. Now, using the nunnery's name, he has filed another lawsuit against Yang Kuihou and the Huzhou Association. However, the disputed land is worth 100,000 yuan, and the legal fees are substantial. The plaintiff claims to be unable to pay them and requests assistance, citing precedents. Yesterday, Judge Luo Chongtai held a hearing on this issue. The plaintiff's attorney gave a detailed account of the history of Shousheng Nunnery and the ownership of the land deeds, stating that the nunnery was built during the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty and belongs to the shaving sect. The position of abbot has been passed down from teacher to disciple through generations without interruption. The nunnery's land, measuring 1 mu, 9 fen, 5 li, and 4 hao, was acquired through donations by a former abbot. The deeds are conversion certificates No. 83 and 84. They were initially entrusted to Huang Zuoqing from Huzhou for safekeeping. Later, Huang declined and transferred them to Yang Kuihou's father, Yang Xinzhi. When the Social Bureau was established last year and began registering temple property, Dison asked Yang Kuihou for the deeds. Yang claimed to have handed them to the Huzhou Association for safekeeping, but the association refused to return them. The association's committee has even submitted a petition to the National Government to convert Shousheng Nunnery into the Yingshi Memorial Hall. The Huzhou Association has no connection to the nunnery, yet it seeks to use political influence to dispose of temple property, which suggests ulterior motives. Therefore, legal protection is necessary. Moreover, the regulations on temple property stipulate that even donations from benefactors cannot be reclaimed. The association is not even a benefactor and should be judged to have no ownership rights. The association should be ordered to return the deeds to the plaintiff. As for the legal fees, the plaintiff should be allowed to provide other guarantees. Judge Luo stated that this was an investigation into evidence and instructed the defendant's lawyer not to provide a verbal defense. He ordered a formal hearing to be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Woke Up and Bedside Companion Was Gone</h3>
<p>Looking Up in Shock, He Cried Out</p>
<p>Wife Hanging in Mid-Air</p>
<p>Xu Jinsheng from Zhenze, No. 1102 Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, made a living selling bamboo poles for drying clothes. His wife, Xu, 31 years old, worked in a sock factory winding yarn to help her husband make ends meet. They were usually on good terms. However, the day before yesterday, the couple had a major conflict over a trivial matter, almost resulting in violence. After the landlord intervened, the situation temporarily subsided. They still slept in the same bed that night. However, when Xu Jinsheng woke up the next morning, he found the bed empty and his wife missing. While wondering, he looked up in shock and cried out. His wife had hanged herself and was swinging like a pendulum. Xu immediately jumped up and cut her down, but she had already died. Seeing that his wife was dead, Xu fled without a trace. The landlord had no choice but to report it to the police station, ordering the local constable, Wang Shaoting, to report to the local court for examination. Inspector Li and other prosecutors were appointed to conduct an on-site examination, ordering the relatives of the deceased to collect the body. If there are no relatives, the charity will collect the body, pending the arrest and interrogation of Xu Jinsheng.</p>
<h3>Statements Regarding the "Never Die" Film Ban Yesterday</h3>
<p>Kwan Hung's Statement: Not Reviewed</p>
<p>Chen De-zheng's Thoughts: Chen De-zheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, expressed his thoughts on the "Never Die" film during Education Bureau Memorial Week, saying:</p>
<p>Regarding the fallacies of Yan Xishan's words and deeds, I already reported in detail during the last memorial week. Now, Yan's troops have invaded Lu Province and openly rebelled. However, the central government has already taken measures, so Yan's demise is imminent and definitely not unexpected. Recently, I will report on the screening of the "Never Die" film, which insults our country, by the Da Guangming and Guanglu cinemas in this city, and briefly state my thoughts. According to those who have seen the film, the content roughly depicts the immoral and irrational actions of overseas Chinese, such as theft, robbery, and kidnapping, etc. The protagonist, Locke, ridicules, mocks, jokes, and insults them, and completely subdues them, describing the barbaric and despicable state of the Chinese to the fullest extent. It is indeed using the film to insult the Chinese. Hong Shen, a professor at Fudan University, was so moved by righteousness when watching this film that he gave a speech on the spot. He was instigated by the Chinese manager of Da Guangming, who carries the signboard of a foreign merchant, to have the police arrest him and send him to the police station, where he was released after four or five hours. We cannot ignore this matter, because film is a form of art, and art can express the national character of a nation, and it can also transform the national character of a nation. Foreigners are accustomed to importing films rich in sensuality and containing danger into China, wanting to eliminate the national character of the Chinese in a subtle way, and to allow Locke, who is good at catering to immature young people and once insulted China, to commit a second insult. If a person is beaten and insulted, he will blush and retaliate. Now, Locke openly insults our entire nation on the screen. All Chinese citizens who make up the nation should rise up and resist and make serious representations. Previously, when a cinema in Chicago, USA, screened "The Birth of a Nation," black audiences rose up in an uproar, seized the film, and burned it. In the end, the director, Griffith, added a thousand feet of footage showing the orderly operation of various businesses run by black people to settle the matter. Oppressed black people, seeing films insulting black people in the United States, and the degree of insult is far less severe than "Never Die," still took such actions. Is it possible that when a film insulting China enters a Chinese port, within Chinese territory, and in a cinema established by Chinese people, nineteen out of ten audiences will not resist or make representations? I remember that Italian sailors seized and burned the film "Street Urchin" because it depicted Italian women prostituting themselves and apologized in a roundabout way to settle the matter. I also remember that the British banned the film "Broken Blossoms" because it depicted Chinese women as superior to British women. Whether Chinese women are superior to British women, and whether Italian women prostituting themselves is an exaggeration, let's not discuss for the time being. But as for Locke's "Never Die," don't say that we Chinese don't believe that overseas Chinese are so capable, even Americans and foreigners living in the United States, as long as they have been to Chinatown or seen Chinese people, wouldn't believe it, right? According to international law, no country can insult any other country without reason. According to literary and artistic morality, no country can insult any other country. Why does Locke, who is recognized as the king of comedy in the United States, impose on others what he does not want for himself? Locke's intention is to take advantage of the Gao Ying couple's drug trafficking case, and then disregard diplomatic relations and morality to do that speculative business. I don't know that the Gao Ying case is just an unfortunate case that occasionally occurs in international relations, the same misfortune as the case of the U.S. Consul's Office Prosecutor Husa in Shanghai being bribed with tens of thousands of dollars and imprisoned two years ago. Our Chinese film merchants have never compiled the Husa case into a script or directed a film, but the American Locke actually used the Gao Ying case as the background, and even interspersed it with despicable and filthy actions that despise the Chinese, insulting the Chinese national character, and screening it everywhere. If we don't make serious representations and let him do whatever he wants, then the Chinese national character is finished. What else is there to talk about revolution?</p>
<p>I heard people say that the heartless owner of Da Guangming, knowing that things were bad, even used the words "This film has been reviewed by the government" to deceive the audience. As a result, some people blamed our film censorship committee. In fact, the owner of Da Guangming, who carries the signboard of a foreign merchant, sells the Chinese national character, and is always slavish and profit-oriented, how can he know that he is a Chinese, and doesn't even know the Chinese government? The government he speaks of can be understood with a little thought. The film review committee of this city will never be so昏瞶 to that point. However, the film censorship committee could not prevent it in advance, resulting in Hong Shen being detained in the police station, the audience paying money to be insulted, and the film still being screened in this city day and night according to a fixed schedule. The film censorship committee deeply regrets and endures this mistake. However, when the film censorship committee was established last year, it also made detailed plans for checking films screened by film companies renting foreign merchant signs in the concession. Later, due to export regulations, the ministry ordered a temporary suspension, so the film censorship in the concession came to a standstill. Otherwise, that kind of film would have no way to be imported, let alone screened at Da Guangming Guanglu, and Hong Shen would not have been taken to the police station, and the audience would not have spent their money in vain. Now, the municipal propaganda department and the film censorship committee are actively working on both the negative and positive sides to ensure that this film and similar films are never allowed to be screened. At the same time, I hope that the Chinese inspectors who work as officials under foreigners will pay attention to the Chinese newspapers run by Chinese people from now on, and under no circumstances should they allow this kind of advertisement to be published. I also hope that the Chinese audiences who pay money without recognizing the goods and the Chinese 洋奴 who only care about benefits and don't talk about rationality will not go to see it again and stop using tricks to run around and dredge up relationships. It must be known that not wanting a nation, not wanting a country, and not wanting a government are the actions of communist bandits. We are believers in the Three Principles of the People. We demand national freedom and equality and revolution. If there is anyone who insults our nation, we will resolutely resist, not afraid of incurring resentment, not afraid of making enemies. We are willing to commit crimes and go to jail, and even be executed, for the sake of the nation. We want to let foreigners know that the Chinese also have the integrity to fight for the nation. According to some people, when the Second Cinema screened "Never Die," each showing was full, nineteen out of ten were Chinese, and ten out of ten were intellectuals. The applause, cheers, and laughter were again from the Chinese. On the one hand, this is the most heartbreaking thing. Let's not talk about Locke's insult, we only need to talk about why the theater owners, the people in charge of the censorship, the people who presided over the speech organs, and all the gentlemanly audiences, they are all Chinese, and they also help to insult the Chinese. Seeing so many unpromising Chinese people, we are reminded of education. It must be known that this situation can especially prove that so-called education is definitely not just teaching people to read and write, nor is it just teaching people to speak and write essays. The biggest task is to cultivate personality, exercise integrity, and create a beautiful and simple social atmosphere of the times. Otherwise, education is in vain.</p>
<p>An Additional Letter from Kwan Hung: Kwan Hung sent a letter to the Municipal Propaganda Department regarding the screening of the "Never Die" film by Da Guangming, saying: Respectfully, upon reading the newspaper report of Hong Shen's presentation to your department, the Da Guangming screening of the "Never Die" film insults the Chinese, please ban it. The text also involves my humble name. After reading it, I was deeply shocked. Hung and I are both Chinese citizens and have patriotic ideas. If the film was reviewed and insulting Chinese events were seen, a proposal should be made to immediately prohibit the screening. Although Hung was elected as one of the committee members of the concession film review committee, this "Never Die" film was not actually within my view, because the organization of the concession film review committee, both Chinese and Western committee members, are voluntary and have their own occupations. For the hundreds of films imported each month, in fact there is no time to review each film one by one. Therefore, ordinary review affairs are managed by the police station. However, the police station only reviews films with questions that cannot be resolved and films that are prohibited from being screened but the company does not accept. This "Never Die" film was not reviewed by the review committee, so Hung did not see it. In addition to writing to the concession film review committee to inquire, I respectfully submit this special letter, and pray for your understanding. This is above the Shanghai Special City Party Executive Committee Propaganda Department of the Chinese Kuomintang, respectfully submitted by Kwan Hung, February 24th.</p>
<p>Declaration of Theater Groups: The Shanghai Nanguo Society and other theater groups issued a declaration against the Locke "Never Die" film incident, saying: On the 22nd of this month, the Da Guangming Theater screened the "Never Die" film starring Locke. The plot of the play is extremely insulting to the Chinese. At that time, Mr. Hong Shen, a colleague in the theater industry, witnessed it on the spot, and in his indignation, he stood up and spoke to the audience, resulting in the whole audience demanding a refund. The theater manager even beat Mr. Hong Shen and called the police to arrest him, detaining him in the police station for three hours before releasing him. Colleagues in the theater industry are deeply indignant about this incident. Imperialist aggression against China is doing everything possible in the economic and cultural fields, and recently it has borrowed the expression of film to make ugly propaganda internationally, to create confusing anesthesia, to confuse black and white, and to mix in rumors. Its impact is not only to insult the Chinese. The "Never Die" film is an example. However, our government has always been unable to pay attention to this kind of problem and impose restrictions, which has led to this kind of strange play happening in a theater run by Chinese people, Da Guangming. The police station even acted recklessly in the process. Mr. Hong Shen had no illegal circumstances, but was arbitrarily arrested and detained without charge. Such oppression is not only the deprivation of Mr. Hong Shen's personal freedom, but also the public humiliation of our entire theater industry. Colleagues in the theater industry deeply wish to be the backing of Mr. Hong Shen and provide united assistance, and to make serious protests against the unreasonable Da Guangming Theater and the barbaric police station, so that this film will be destroyed and will no longer be screened in countries around the world. At the same time, we further wish to arouse the people of the whole country to pay attention to imported films in the future. If similar incidents occur again, we will use the power of the masses to directly ban them. This is a declaration by Nanguo Society, Xinyou Troupe, Art Theater Society, Modern Society, Fudan Theater Society, Daxia Theater Society, New Art Theater Society, Qingdao Theater Society, and Theater Art Society.</p>
<p>Letter from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Association: The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Association, because the Guanglu and Da Guangming cinemas in this port are screening the "Never Die" film starring Locke, deliberately insulting overseas Chinese, has some claims, and specially sent a letter to the Film Censorship Committee, saying: Dear Sirs, Recently, I read in the newspapers that your association specially held a temporary meeting yesterday to discuss the sound film "Never Die" starring the American Locke, which has been screened recently in the Da Guangming and Guanglu cinemas in the special area of this city. It is set in Chinatown in the United States, and completely depicts Chinese people as thieves, kidnappers, selling opium, and other kinds of vile, barbaric, and inferior acts, insulting the Chinese to the utmost extent, which greatly affects the national honor and international status of our country. The summary of the various response methods decided on the spot shows that your association is serious about doing things. How can I not admire it? After investigating, Chinese people have a long history of living in the United States and have special virtues. Such as being hardworking and frugal, which is already known to everyone. Supporting the national revolution has been unswerving for a long time, and is especially admired by the party and the country. As for last spring, a Chinese man from Pingxiang, Mr. Ye Xiaojian, did not苟取 the遺篋 containing huge sums of money hidden by an American woman in Chicago, USA. He waited for a long time to return it and refused a generous reward, which was greatly admired by the entire American people. A banquet was held to welcome him, and the Western newspapers scrambled to publish the incident, titled the most honorable person in China, called the Lincoln of China. This is enough to show the special virtues of overseas Chinese in the United States. The film's exaggerated promotion of the ugliness of overseas Chinese and concealing their beauty, saying that it contains political implications and encourages white people to reject overseas Chinese, is not an exaggeration. Even if there are two or three unscrupulous elements among overseas Chinese in the United States who disregard national dignity and commit such ugly acts, this is also due to the fact that木先腐然後蟲生, because the reason for this is often due to the design and enticement of unscrupulous Americans. Moreover, just in terms of selling and smoking opium, it is even more deeply hated by the general overseas Chinese. As in Europe, there is the Overseas Anti-Drug Support Association organized by Madam Zheng Ranghui, the wife of Minister Wang Jingqi, and in Southeast Asia, there is the Overseas Chinese Anti-Smoking Committee initiated by the giant businessman Chen Jiageng. Overseas Chinese in other places are also rising up and rejecting drugs in unison. Locke, the star of the film, completely disregards the facts and deliberately slanders, provoking ill will between the Chinese and Americans. Such things not only damage Locke's personal virtue, and the Chinese people regard him as a public enemy, but also impartial foreigners will probably severely criticize him. Since our association takes serving overseas Chinese as its mission, we can hardly remain silent in the face of the film's insult to overseas Chinese.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Therefore, based on what I have seen, I purchased it for your association, and I hope that you will work tirelessly to implement the established response methods to extend public opinion and protect the reputation of overseas Chinese, which is very helpful.</p>

<h3>Male Corpse in Huangpu River Shows Signs of Murder</h3>
<p>Suffocated and Thrown into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Police Speculate</p>
<p>At about 6:00 AM yesterday, a male corpse suddenly floated up in the Huangpu River near Jinliyuan Wharf, Sixteen Pu. He was about 20 years old, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, a Western-style short coat, rubber overshoes, black socks, and his hair was long. His eyes were covered with cloth strips, his mouth was stuffed with a towel, and his hands and feet were tightly tied with ropes. He floated on the river surface. The body was discovered by Chinese police officer No. 12 of the Lujiazui Water Police Station. The body was fished back to the police station. The head police officer observed that the corpse was in this shape, which seemed like he was tied up by enemies before his death, losing his freedom first, and blinding his eyes so that his vision was ineffective, and then suffocating him with a towel in his mouth. Fearing that the corpse had no place to be placed, he was thrown into the Huangpu River to destroy the traces. Based on the above speculations, the police officers believed that there was no doubt. However, the corpse's dress was very similar to that of a worker, and he had not been in the water for very long. The head police officer, considering that it was a case of murder and that no relatives claimed the body, ordered the detectives to transport the body to the morgue for examination, and requested the local court to send someone to examine it before proceeding to check the family members to claim it.</p>
<h3>Impoverished Man Attempts Suicide in River</h3>
<p>Rescued by a Boatman</p>
<p>Shi Yufeng from Zhenping, Anhui, 29 years old, had been unemployed for a long time in his hometown and was unable to make a living. Therefore, he came to Shanghai to seek employment. He has been eating and living at the home of his nephew, Xu Heshang, at No. 29 Jingxinli, behind the Pudong Hospital on the Pudong Police Station Road, for more than a year. Unexpectedly, his luck was not good, and he never had a suitable position. Thinking that he no longer had the face to rely on his nephew to make a living, he drafted two letters of testament at 7:00 AM the day before, hid them on his person, and went to the Taikoo Wharf in Lanni Ferry alone, jumping into the river to commit suicide. He was spotted by a nearby boatman, who immediately took measures to rescue him and sent him to the third district public security bureau. The district chief read the contents of his suicide note and showed it to his nephew, expressing his gratitude for the long time he had provided food and lodging, and that if he died and was salvaged, his body should be sent to his nephew's house for collection. After reading it, the district chief asked about the details and ordered the police to summon his nephew, Xu Heshang, to the district and lead him away.</p>
<h3>Economic Pressure Leads to Opium Suicide Attempt</h3>
<p>Li Zhaosheng from Zhenping, Henan, 29 years old, used to be in the silk and satin business in his hometown and had wealthy assets. Because he was repeatedly ravaged by bandits last winter, all his property was burned to the ground. He had no choice but to take a boat to Shanghai alone five days ago, temporarily residing at the Zhonghe 字号 (because the 号 is a silk and satin business run by Henan people) at No. 136 Ningbo Road in this port, intending to borrow some money from his fellow villagers. However, those who are engaged in the silk and satin business this year have mostly lost money, which has led to爱莫能助. Seeing this situation, Li was greatly disappointed. Looking back at his hometown, his wife and children cried, which was very pitiful. He felt depressed and suddenly had the idea of committing suicide. At about 12:00 noon yesterday, he secretly took a dose of opium paste to commit suicide. Fortunately, a fellow villager found out and immediately accompanied him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Hotel Guest Dies Tragically from Opium</h3>
<p>Chen Baochang from Ningbo, 20 years old, checked into a room at the Ruixing Inn opposite the Great World on Mintini Road in the French Concession the night before. For some reason, he suddenly had the idea of committing suicide and took raw opium. When the waiter saw that Chen was lying in bed and had not gotten up until 9:00 AM yesterday, he went to call him but he did not respond. Upon entering the room and inspecting, Chen had already died. His body was cold. The innkeeper immediately reported to the police station, who ordered detectives to go to the scene for investigation. The body was transported to the autopsy center of Tongren 辅元堂. The detectives investigated and summoned the brother of the deceased, Chen Baocai, to the case and waited for the report of the autopsy.</p>
<h3>Attempted Suicide After Theft of Proceeds from Sale of Land</h3>
<p>Zhang Yongxing from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang, 25 years old, sold several acres of land in his hometown a few days ago, obtaining 1,115 yuan. The day before yesterday (the 19th), he brought the money to Shanghai to start a business. Unexpectedly, while passing through Jiaxing in the car, a pickpocket stole the money. The man himself did not know. When he got off the train at the South Station, he realized that the money had vanished. Feeling indignant, he had the idea of committing suicide.

He was caught by the police officer at post No. 1348, who immediately took measures to rescue him and took him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

Afterwards, Chen Tailun cried to his mother, Chen Huang, but the latter has the nickname of female tiger. So she led her son to the Zheng family to question them. Because the child had smallpox, Zheng was afraid of causing忌諱 and apologized repeatedly. The woman refused and made a scene in his shop, destroying the glass windows and mirrors. Xiao Liuzi was frightened inside and cried loudly. People persuaded them to leave. The next day, Xiao Liu suddenly died. Zheng Jinbao believed that his son's death was due to fright. Yesterday, he twisted and accused the Chen couple and Chen's son together to the Sixth District Police Department.

<p>Kang Guitang, Kang Yintao, Kang Jujin, and others, represented by Mudiyi, filed a complaint in the criminal court of the French Public Concession, stating that the plaintiffs had a ancestral graveyard, totaling four mu, located in the French New Concession under its jurisdiction, with a total of fourteen original receipts as evidence. Unexpectedly, labels were suddenly found on the graveyard, with the words Shatian Bureau written on them. After investigation by the plaintiffs, it was learned that the labels were inserted by Zhou Fugen, a current local security clerk, on the orders of the official property office. Therefore, the plaintiffs questioned Zhou, who said that the labels were inserted on the orders of the official property office. Therefore, the plaintiffs asked the Land Bureau. Zhou Fugen was also summoned to the scene, but he suddenly claimed that he did not know about this matter. Before long, Lian Ji came forward and leased the land to others in a perpetual lease, with the stamp of the outgoing local security Huang Yuliang. The defendants committed fraud and requested an investigation. The defendant Lian Ji evaded and did not appear. The defendant Huang Yuliang was defended by Attorney Thibeaut, who stated that the land was a浜基 and was used as public property by the official property office, so the label was inserted. The Chinese and Western officials ordered them to leave and wait for another hearing at a later date.</p>

<p>Cinema Usher Secretly Picks Up a Lost Wallet</p>
<p>Manager Honestly Reports to the Police, Praiseworthy</p>
<p>Silver Dollars Ordered to Be Paid Back in Full</p>
<p>A moviegoer named Jia at the Jiuxing Cinema on Avenue Foch in the French Concession lost a wallet containing sixteen silver dollars. Li Wulin, an usher at the cinema, found the wallet and shared the money with his colleagues Ma Xianglin and Chen Nianyou. Shen Shi, the manager of the cinema, discovered this and reported it to the police, who arrested the three men. They were brought before the French court yesterday, where Judge Zhu heard the case.</p>
<p>The police chief first presented the details of the case. Manager Shen Shi of the cinema testified that the loser had reported the loss to the box office but, as it was not found, it was not returned. According to the cinema's regulations, ushers are required to report any lost items found. Because the defendants concealed the wallet, there was initially no return. Now that the matter has been uncovered, but the loser’s name and address is unknown, he requests a verdict.</p>
<p>Li Wulin confessed that he found the wallet while sweeping the floor and distributed one dollar to Ma Xianglin and two dollars to Chen Nianyou, keeping thirteen dollars for himself. He claimed he was new to the usher position and unaware of the regulations, requesting leniency for Ma and Chen. Ma and Chen admitted to receiving and spending the money, but stated that they have returned it in full and pleaded for leniency.</p>
<p>The judge ordered Li Wulin to return the full amount within seven days. The sixteen dollars, including the amounts returned by Ma and Chen, will be held by the police. If unclaimed within two months, the money will be confiscated. Li Wulin was fined one dollar as a warning. Ma and Chen were released with leniency.</p>

<p>The colleagues of the victims were summoned yesterday morning and escorted to the Provisional Court. Judge Tan Xinzhen presided over the preliminary hearing.

He claimed he had been falsely accused and requested his release. The police requested a postponement, so the hearing was adjourned, and Judge Tan ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>

<p>Weile Garden Speedway Competition</p>
<p>Promoting Speedway and Other New Forms of Entertainment</p>
<p>The Weile Garden Speedway Competition, funded by American businessmen with a capital of 100,000 yuan, is located near the Haig Road Racecourse. It can accommodate 10,000 spectators, and the grounds are spacious enough to add another 15,000 seats. The Weile Garden Clubhouse, built inside the speedway, has 400 dressing rooms. Members can enjoy ice skating and dancing in the safe zone between the track and the dressing rooms during competitions. Li Qiaoao is the honorary director of the Weile Garden Clubhouse.</p>
<p>The 250-meter-long speedway is built according to the regulations of the International Cycling Union, with banks as high as 80 degrees. Competitions are divided into professional and amateur categories. Currently, speedways and motor speedways exist in Paris, New York, London, Berlin, and other major cities around the world.</p>
<p>In addition to speedway competitions, the venue will also host tennis, basketball, ice skating, and other sports or entertainment activities. The clubhouse has a unique structure that allows the roof to be opened on sunny days for open-air events, making it ideal for various sports. The club has acquired 25 acres of land, and construction of the buildings is about to begin. The first priority is the training field, which is already available. Chinese citizens with a clean background and strong physique can go there for free without any obligation to the club, but they must undergo rigorous physical training under the management and guidance of Swedish sports expert Mr. Bengsen. The training provided at the venue is military-style. Currently, there are about 65 young Chinese men in training, aged between 17 and 25.</p>
<p>The construction of Weile Garden is entirely funded by Shanghai capital, and the shares have been fully subscribed. Weile Garden does not sell stocks, and its directors are all prominent figures in Shanghai's business and professional circles. The initiator is Mr. Bu Mangde, and Mr. Laiheshi, the general manager of the French Shanghai Daily, has spent most of his life involved in speedway and motor speedway competitions. Therefore, with his expert guidance, it is certain that excellent results will be achieved.</p>
<p>The competitions at the club will include professional and amateur leagues, and it is hoped that international competitions will also be held. People from various countries in Shanghai are currently organizing leagues. Anyone willing to practice a little each day can use the club's speedway, but they must be a member of the International Cycling Union to ensure that famous international speedway racers will not refuse to drive on the club's track when they visit Shanghai.</p>
<p>The directors and staff of the Weile Garden Speedway Competition are as follows: Da Lasi (a famous figure enthusiastic about horse racing), Shi Kuiai (a current affairs foreign firm), Laiheshi (general manager of the French Shanghai Daily), Li Hongao (Kelly &amp; Walsh), Chen Shouzhi (Peichang Company), Tailiba (manager of the Tiny Hotel), Tao Qing (United Transport Company), Peng Desen (sports instructor), Dr. Na Dan, and Bu Mangde (Chairman).</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read your esteemed newspaper's local news on February 24th regarding the suppression of bandits by the Shanghai-Hankou warship, the article stated that the sea bandits Li Jinbiao, Bai Qi, and Wang Xing were captured and executed by firing squad in Shengshan. This is not entirely accurate. The bandits were killed on the spot while resisting arrest. The so-called public display was only of the bodies of the three criminals. The names were also identified by the locals. Because the squadron must report the facts to the superiors, I request that your esteemed newspaper correct the record to reflect the true events. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Wang Qingfu, Guerrilla Captain of the 4th District of the Wusong Water Police.</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the news column in your esteemed newspaper on the 24th of this month regarding some family members of the victims of the May 30th Massacre not having received compensation, I would like to state that this information is completely fabricated by a small number of individuals. The distribution of compensation and various expenditures by our association last year were decided upon by a joint meeting of various Shanghai party, government, and military organizations, as well as the Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Taxpayer Association, and the May 30th Cemetery Board. The decisions were also approved and signed by all registered family members of our association. We have the meeting minutes as proof. How can it be said that we made decisions without authorization? As for the statement that the compensation exceeded 3,000 yuan per deceased, it should be noted that representatives Hu and Chen have worked tirelessly for the past four years, traveling back and forth between Beijing and Shanghai. Their expenses have totaled thousands of yuan. Although some public funds were provided, they covered less than one-tenth of the costs. This sacrifice was not solely for their benefit. If not for Hu and Chen's relentless efforts to appeal on all sides, the matter would likely still be unresolved, and no one knows how much longer it would have taken. Who would have helped or contributed a single penny to the families in these four years? As for the 5,000 yuan compensation, it was also decided upon at the joint meeting to recognize the two representatives' spirit of enduring hardship and striving for the safety of all family members. They have become permanently disabled, and their future livelihoods are uncertain. Our association's meeting place was temporarily located at the Xicheng Business Association due to a lack of funds during the initial organization last year. After the relocation of Xicheng, our association moved to Minqiu School. However, the school premises were cramped, and the personnel were complicated, making it unsuitable for conducting business. Therefore, we are currently seeking a suitable location and making arrangements. As the procedures have not been finalized, we have temporarily delayed publishing a notice to gather the family members who have not yet received compensation. However, more than a dozen people who have already registered with our association have come forward continuously in recent days. Therefore, representatives Hu and Chen have not been avoiding anyone. The continued organization of our association has already been approved by the various ministries and departments of the National Government and the party and government organs of this city, requesting to be put on file. There will be no disruption by any second party. The representative qualifications of Hu and Chen were long ago recommended by a number of family members and recognized by various higher-level organizations. Third parties have no right to interfere with their dismissal, and it cannot be undermined by a small number of people. We fear that outsiders are unaware of the truth and may be misled. This matter concerns the reputation of several associations and representatives Hu and Chen. Therefore, we specially request your newspaper to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to clarify the facts. With respectful greetings to the chief editor of the Shanghai edition of the Shen Bao.</p>

<p>Student: “Two.”</p>
<p>Teacher: “Your arithmetic isn’t bad. When you go home, have your father give you a real-world test.”</p>
<p>A: “You borrowed my umbrella and haven’t returned it for two weeks.”</p>
<p>B: “The weather is unpredictable. I need to keep it in case it rains again.”</p>
<p>Child: “Father, what’s the difference between ‘civilization and barbarism’?”</p>
<p>Father: “That’s very simple. Civilized people can kill their enemies with cannonballs from six thousand yards away. Barbarians can only chop off people’s heads with a broadsword.”</p>
<p>The Treasures of a Naturalist Jie Lu</p>
<p>Is Mr. Zhong Xianchang of Zhejiang the pioneer of natural science research in our country? Mr. Zhong’s given name is Guanguang, a native of Chaiqiao, Zhenhai. In the late Qing Dynasty, Western learning gradually spread to the East. It was not easy to find scholars of physics, chemistry, zoology, botany, and mineralogy at that time. Although there were translation textbooks by Du Yaquan, Du Jiutian, Zhang Xiujue, Hua Wenqi, and Xie Honglai, Mr. Zhong's promotion was the most prominent.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong was skilled in writing and eloquent. The textbooks he compiled on botany, zoology, physics, and chemistry were simple and fluent, far beyond the reach of others. At that time, when Jie Lu was young, he once listened to Mr. Zhong's lectures on physiology and hygiene at the supplementary class of the Ningbo Prefectural Education Association for more than a day. He explained it clearly and eloquently, moving people's hearts. He was not like later teachers, who dragged their feet, were incoherent, and cited broadly, embellishing the papers with foreign languages, making them obscure and deceitful. This was also a common failing of modern education, which Mr. Zhong disdained.</p>
<p>Later, Mr. Zhong ran a science vocational school in Shanghai. Cai Yuanpei of Shaoxing and others studied there. Therefore, most of the people from Zhenhai who work at the Shixue Tongyi Hall and the Scientific Instrument Hall on Qipan Street in Shanghai today are due to Mr. Zhong's promotion. Alas, many scholars today become officials, but Mr. Zhong, as a pioneer in the scientific community, lives in seclusion in the Wulin Mountains, unknown and unheard of. Few people know about him.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong's younger brother, named Weizhang, is also deeply accomplished in zoology. Today, he also lives in seclusion in a rural dyeing workshop to earn his own living. Isn't that admirable?</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong has the deepest research in botany. I am afraid there is no second person in the whole of China. Once, in a mountain in Fujian, he chopped down hazel bushes, burned thatch, climbed up and collected strange flowers and herbs. Suddenly, he muttered to himself, "What a treasure! What a treasure!" Before he finished speaking, a thief jumped out of the forest, holding a knife in front of Mr. Zhong and said, "Quickly hand over the treasure to me, or don't blame my merciless blade!" Mr. Zhong smiled and said, "How can a poor scholar have treasures? Let the hero find them himself." The thief then searched Mr. Zhong's body but found nothing. Mr. Zhong then realized that when he said "What a treasure!" the thief thought he had really found a treasure. So, he showed the thief a plant and said, "The treasure I have obtained is this. It belongs to a certain family of plants. I have traveled all over China, and today I finally obtained it here. Can't it be called a treasure?" The thief laughed and left.</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Lifei’s Song for Persuading Against Foot Binding Qian Yan</p>
<p>This publication has previously written about Mr. Qian Lifei of Jiaxing and his prolific writing to persuade people to do good. Therefore, Mr. Qian's posthumous works should be heeded by those who enjoy reading this publication. Now, we record his song for persuading women not to bind their feet to show the world. Reading this will show that Mr. Qian was not a stubborn person, and his thinking can be called innovative.</p>
<p>The song says: "People's hands and feet are born by heaven. Women's foot binding is extremely painful. If you say that big feet can't be married off, the ladies of Guangdong are all married off. Xi Shi and Wang Zhaojun both had natural feet. I have never heard of big feet being ridiculed. Wu Yan and Momo’s feet were not small. The virtuous are fought over by everyone. Jiangxi and Hubei have many small feet. Everything depends on their husbands. They cannot escape floods and fires. They suffer military disasters and are disgraced. Moreover, the pain of binding is unbearable. No one asks about the dripping blood. Loving mothers bind their daughters' feet. The more blood there is, the tighter they bind. Tendons break and bones break, and they cannot sleep at night. Strong species become weak species. After binding, ten feet become toys, only used for husbands to tease and play with. Civilized places opened up early. Every family's women's feet have already stretched. There are no small feet in girls’ schools. Only prostitutes have bound feet. This is to please people with their feet. Why should respectable women do this? I advise civilized, virtuous women, quickly release the bound and prohibit the unbound. Civilized men must earnestly advise, and those who still want to bind feet will be looked down upon. Half of our country's compatriots are women. Natural feet give birth to strong species. If you want a strong country, you must release your feet. A strong country will not be invaded by foreigners. A piece of heartfelt, earnest advice. Civilized women must listen. If women are willing not to bind their feet, the persuader's merit is immense. Persuading everyone to release their feet is better than worshiping Guanyin at Putuo."</p>
<p>Five Broken Stamps Qian</p>
<p>The merchant Wu Zhiqing was fairly well-off. He had a son nicknamed Wuguan, who did not engage in proper business but was fond of gambling. In mid-October of last year, he went to the countryside to gamble and was kidnapped by lake bandits, who demanded a ransom of six thousand gold pieces. Although Wu Zhiqing loved his son, he was constrained by his finances and could not afford to pay. He was very worried. His relative, Xu, ran around negotiating three or four times. Because the lake bandits considered Wuguan a rare commodity, they would only agree to an 80% discount on the ransom. This was not successful. Wu Zhiqing borrowed money from all sides. After two months, he barely managed to get four thousand gold pieces. He then scheduled to have Xu redeem his son on the Lantern Festival. However, the day before the Lantern Festival, Wu Zhiqing suddenly received a letter from the lake bandits. When he opened it, there was no letter inside, only five broken stamps. He knew that his son Wuguan had been killed. He cried out in pain. On one hand, he hired someone to find the body. On the other hand, he set up an altar to pray for repentance. He sent out mourning cards everywhere, extremely solemn. Then, the day before yesterday (the 19th) in the evening, his son Wuguan suddenly returned by boat. Wu Zhiqing wiped his eyes and looked carefully. Seeing that it was indeed a live person, he laughed through his tears. He kicked the spirit seat away and tore the white curtain into pieces. He asked Wuguan how he had managed to return and had not cost a single penny. Wuguan said that he had escaped by taking advantage of a gap. He said that the lake bandits were all addicted to gambling. He could not help but become itchy while confined in the bandit den. He occasionally boasted about his skills in front of the bandit leader. The bandit leader ordered him to teach them and appointed him as an honored guest. He knew that the bandit den was not a safe place for him in the end, and there was also a lot of danger since the central government had sent capable personnel to suppress the bandits. So, he escaped while the bandit leader was sound asleep.</p>
<p>Wu Zhiqing was both surprised and happy to hear this. He gave the ransom letter to his son and asked if it was sent by the lake bandits. Wuguan said, "It was sent by me. Because I was afraid that Father would bring the gold to redeem me and waste it in vain, I wrote this threatening letter. I originally intended to write about the comfortable life in the bandit den, but I was afraid of being inspected by the bandits, so I did not succeed. This letter was only sent out with the approval of the bandit leader. I did not expect Father to believe it was real."</p>
<p>The son was kidnapped for gambling, but in the end, he was exempted because of gambling. It cannot be said that this is not a strange thing.</p>
<p>Special Record of the Shaanxi Disaster Fen Gong</p>
<p>Heaven has brought disaster to China, causing famine every year and smoke from the beacon fires every year. Floods, fires, and bandits are all rampant. The situation and scenery of the disasters in Shaanxi and Henan</p>
<h3>Sentencing of Robbers and Kidnappers</h3>
<p>Heaviest Sentence is Twenty Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple police station previously apprehended nine robbers, including Han Jiaxing. They seized five pistols and thirty bullets, and immediately began an investigation. Except for Zhang Rongchang, who had not committed any crimes, the others had successively used weapons to rob several households, including Ban Liangzuo at No. 60 Sichuan Road, a certain Mr. at No. 861 Qipu Road, and Gu Jinbao on Jiangwan Road. They also attempted to kidnap Xu Xiangsheng on Dongyouheng Road. After summoning witnesses and submitting them to the Provisional Court for investigation, the verdict was announced yesterday morning. Zhang Rongchang's lawyer, Fan Gang, also attended the court. Judge Sun Yuan took the bench and sentenced Han Jiaxing and Hu Longgen to twenty years imprisonment each. Lu Hequn was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment. Zhang Bingrong and Zhang Kunsheng were sentenced to four years and two months imprisonment each. Mao Xubao was sentenced to four years imprisonment, and Li Abao and Zhou Ruigen were sentenced to six months imprisonment each. Zhang Rongchang was found not guilty, and the pistols and bullets were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Jiang Xingchu, Accomplice in the Assassination of Monk Zhang, Arrested in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Zhang Heshang, a native of Changzhou, was shot and killed on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai on July 26 of last year. Later, the police arrested two murderers, Liu Honggen and Liu Guangwen, who were interrogated and convicted by the Provisional Court. An arrest warrant was also issued for the accomplice, Jiang Xingchu, to be brought to justice. It has now been learned that Jiang had fled to the countryside in Wuxi and was recently arrested by the Wuxi County Government. He was handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and transferred to the local court for investigation. The Jing'an Temple police station learned of this, and because the crime scene was in the concession, they specifically requested a document from the Provisional Court and sent detectives Cao Ashan and Bao Tanyuanchang to the local court the day before yesterday. They brought Jiang back to the police station and escorted him to the Provisional Court yesterday morning. Judge Sun opened the trial. Zhang Wangshi, the wife of the deceased, filed a lawsuit, stating that on June 12th of the previous year (lunar calendar), when her husband Zhang Heshang was at home, Jiang Xingchu suddenly came from outside and lured her husband out. Soon after, she heard Jiang shouting "Open, open!" outside the door, and then gunshots rang out several times. She rushed out and saw her husband lying on the ground, bleeding profusely. The murderer had already fled, but her husband was still saying, "Jiang Xingchu, you shouldn't have..." After a while, detectives arrived to investigate. Her husband had disagreements with Jiang over money in the past, and there was long-standing resentment. Therefore, he callously committed this heinous act. Subsequently, Detective Bao reported the situation of the investigation at the scene of the incident, saying that when he arrived, the injured party was still able to speak. He questioned the injured party as to who the murderer was, and he claimed that he had been shot by Jiang Xingchu. He was then sent to the hospital and died of his injuries shortly after. When questioned, Jiang Xingchu confessed to knowing the deceased, but denied having any animosity or firing the gun. Judge Sun ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the hearing for seven days for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Zhou, A Woman for All Men</h3>
<p>Record of Second Husband and Fourth Husband Fighting Over a Wife</p>
<p>Shi Chunfa, a 35-year-old native of Huzhou, filed a complaint with the Baoshan County Government against Zhou, the wife of Han Yongwen of Luodian, the day before yesterday, and Zhou was taken into custody. Yesterday at 1:00 PM, County Magistrate Wu Jianong opened the trial. Shi Chunfa testified that the defendant, Zhou, had lived with him in their hometown for four years, but suddenly eloped without his knowledge last spring and engaged in an illicit relationship with a man surnamed Han. He requested a strict investigation. The defendant, Zhou, testified that she was 30 years old and a fellow villager of Shi. Although they lived together for four years, they were only acquainted through an affair. They had a daughter who is now nine years old. County Magistrate Wu asked in surprise, "If you only lived with Shi for four years, how do you have a nine-year-old daughter?" Zhou replied that the daughter was from her previous husband, Sun, who had passed away. After Sun's death, she remarried Shi Chunfa. Later, because Shi had no job and could not support her, she left and went to Hangzhou to visit her younger sister. She searched everywhere but could not find her. Having no choice, she returned to Shanghai, where she met a man named Yao Huiguang in Yangshupu and lived with him for several months. Later, she became destitute again and was sold to Han Yongwen of Luodian, who is now her fourth husband. After reviewing the testimony, County Magistrate Wu found the woman's testimony to be extremely licentious and ordered her to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Demanding Repayment of Debt Leads to Assault</h3>
<p>Song Bingkui, a 24-year-old local, was at the Laohuzao (stove shop) of Mantingfang on Six Ma Road at around 10:00 PM last night, demanding repayment of six yuan and forty cents from a gangster known as "Lai Litou" (Scabby Head) A Liang. Unexpectedly, A Liang not only refused to repay the money but instead grabbed an axe and struck Song in the left back, causing profuse bleeding and causing him to fall to the ground. He was then taken to Renji Hospital in a vehicle, and the hospital reported the incident to the Laozha Police Station, requesting that the perpetrator be arrested and severely punished.</p>
