<p>日本人對於籃球素不重視、惟自前次歸國、積極提倡、以雪歷届遠東運動會之恥、球員進步、出乎吾人之所料、其所以能勝吾隊者、要而言之、即投射傳遞、迅速準確、數字而耳、其所得之分數、大半由於遠射、全隊隊員皆能忍苦耐勞、自始至終、並無倦容、若言陣法、尙屬幼穉、鄙人逆料、今後遠東運動會、實爲中菲心腹之患也、中華隊爲久練之師、各種經騐、大都嘗過、國内全無敵手、目空一切、以爲區區無名島國籃球、何足懼哉、其自信能力過深、諺所謂、謙受益、滿招損者、實可爲吾籃球隊諸君戒也、比賽失敗、而怨及公證人、此非固運動家應有之態度、然人心之不同、各如其面、且評判術之寬嚴·精粗·智愚·誠狡、亦離一律、吾隊經騐富則富矣、然尤有未到者、即對於公證人之態度是也、公證人之人格·品性·智識·經騐·各有不同、球員平素練習、宜剷除一切違例、不良習慣、即使人有可疑之點者、亦必除之、勿利用公證人之弱點、而成爲不良積習、即公證人之智識淺陋者、吾亦必依規則行之、或有故意偏私者、亦不與較、即被其枉罰數次、亦必平心靜氣、不可焦急、在此衆目共覩之下、稍有良心者、必不敢明目張胆希騙、即有之、公論自在、雖敗尤榮、否則雖爭辯也、奮怒也、不特於事無補、且對於隊員心理上、技術上聯絡上、受種種刺激、必不能盡其力而行、往往强隊敗于弱隊者、以其一方面與敵隊鬥、一方面又須與公證人鬥、夫如是、鮮有不敗者、辦事人自當切法與之交涉、有時其如彼等並無較此再好者何、</p>
<p>技術方面、中華隊、用五人聯防守地法、此法防守雖嚴、惟破此陣者亦有數法、日隊深知吾隊情形、早已計劃、用遠射法破吾陣、若觀紀錄上日人所得之分數、大半皆由於遠射、則可知矣、吾隊隊員穏定、惟執球在手、傳射太慢、屢屢因此而失機會、又傳球太多、每次必須將球傳至籃下、然後投射、日人身手繏敏、往往將球奪去、而無法近籃、故投射之機會極少、不得已而變更計劃、亦用遠射法、惟平素鮮練習、臨時行之、多有不、準確之弊、故得不償失、隊員中有少涵養者、經公證人之剖球、傍觀者之謾駡、心爲之分、同隊者或本人、有所錯誤、則焦急萬分、形於舉動、此皆我隊失敗之理由也、</p>

<p>第二局、菲阿　亞夫人、（ＭRF　Ochoa)以六對二五對七、六對一勝我國李牡丹女士、女子第二場之戰鬥至烈、亦今日女子比賽中最有精彩之一幕、李起始開球、連告不利、共敗五盤、阿夫人大有一鼓直下之勢幸第六七盤時、牡丹精神忽振、抽球迭獲效果竟使敵無一勝之機會、觀衆方謂局事改變、中華從此否去泰來不謂阿太太亦特别加油、繼勝二盤遂以六對二勝第一局、第二局惡戰更烈、牡丹博得歡聲不少、而表演亦實不弱、惜未能維持、至終仍不免第三局敗耳、最初各勝一盤、繼又各方連勝二盤成二對之三比阿夫人於七八盤奮勇直前、得五對三之優勢、李女士急起追趕、血戰結果、以七對五挽回殘局、獲勝第二局、這連勝四盤、由敗轉勝之戰績使菲選手恐惶萬狀阿夫人已是倦容可掬、行動遲緩、而牡丹花則前後左右、奔駛迅速、球到人到、且滿面笑顔、一似確有把握者、不謂天不我助、李女士醋戰之餘、難免疎忽遂爲敵所乘、第三局决賽戰開始、未久即連敗四盤、雖振作精神、獲得第五盤但爲時已晚、莫能挽救、又連敗二盤終以一對六敗北焉、</p>
<p>總觀今日表演、日選手佐藤布井二氏、實力確實不弱、勝菲可無問題將來與我林邱二君、定有一番血戰、鹿死誰手、殊未敢預料女子方面、二李自是强手、菲阿朝亞夫人亦屬勁敵、中菲女子之勝負、或將决於明日之雙打矣、惟日女選手實力雄厚、我即勝菲、仍非特别努力不可、就二李球藝上言、杏花女士對手較弱、故前後二局、均極閒逸、開球甚準確而有力、牡丹女士、表演甚佳、雖敗猶榮、故球尤見特别工夫、惟過於保守、甚少進攻、使敵人以逸待勞、且屢用聲東擊西之詭技、而得點、牡丹小姐抽球之技、頗有可觀第一局六七兩盤、即以此致勝、如能在良好機會時、略略多用則阿氏之敗可無問題、質之李小姐、不知亦以爲然否、</p>

<p>江蘇省義務教育委員會第二次會議、於五月二十九日下午三時舉行、出席者、謝冰朱經農·葉楚傖·陳樹年·陳和銑·楊乃康·黃紹鴻·叚育華·主席陳和銑、記錄黃紹鴻、開會如儀、報告事項、主席報告江蘇各縣義務教育情形、討論事項、一、修正江蘇省會義務教育實騐區計劃案、决議（一）計劃案修正通過、（二）詳細預算由教廳編定十九年度以十五萬元爲限、（三）經費公推吳委員稚暉葉委員楚傖陳委員樹年籌商二、籌辦［單獨設立］與［集中編制］的師範學校案、决議本案推朱許謝三委員審查并函請農礦廳就辦理農事機關人員中指派參加、三、試行義務教育的第一步辦法案、决議通過、五時十五分散會、</p>
<p>試行義務教育的第一步辦法（楊乃康）這一次全國教育會議實施義務教育初步計畫案、在目標項下已經决定、［凡不能繼續在學四年的兒童、得酌量變通他們在求學期間而用補習學校或自修制度補足他們應受的義務教育、］這是從貧寒兒童一方面打算的、我們從設學的一方着想、照現在各縣經濟的能力師資的情形、要使已達學齡的兒童個個都入初級小學、事實上萬萬辦不到、如果要呌他們等到省縣經費籌足師資完成的时候、再來就學、那末他們已躭擱了不少時候、吃虧不小了、</p>
<p>所以我們現在應打定一個［卑之無甚高論］的態度要使這一般失學的兒童、趕快得有求學機會、美國在一八五二年的時候、麻塞怯思省始頒布强迫教育制度、從八歲至十四歲的兒童定每年就學十二個星期、以後推行到各省、到一八九八年已經有二十二省行了强迫教育的制度、全國義務教育的施行、一直到一九一九年才能完成、日本在明治五年頒定學制、人口滿六百的地方、要設定一個小學區、六歲以上的兒童無論男女、一定要呌他們就學、最初也以每年就學四個月、滿十六個月爲修了期、又進爲三年的簡易科、現在是定爲六年了、從美國和日本已往的義務教育歷史看來、他們的義務教育、起初也是很簡單的、等到國家經濟充足、才變成現在這個樣子、所以我們不必急急仿照他們現在的樣子、應照他們從前的樣子先做起來、</p>
<p>依我個人的意見、就照這一回全國教育會議議决變通辦法的意思、先試辦一種二小時制的初級小學、招收這一種十歲左右不能完全入正式小學的兒童、强迫他們每天來修學二小時、所授課程的内容比現在的初級小學要少、有幾種主要學科就够了、假定每年授課五百小時（三萬分鐘）滿足一千五百小時（九萬分鐘）就作爲義務教育修了、</p>
<p>這末一來、假定每個教員每天担任八小時、每個教室每天可以輪流收受四級兒童、豈非一個教師可以當做四個人、一個教室可以作四個教室、一級經費可以當做四級之用、這是最經濟没有的了、</p>
<p>這一種辦法、並不是開倒車、實在因爲現在的失學兒童太多了、璧如遇着一種天天挨餓的人、救濟的人、因爲糧食不充足、就連米湯都不灌、一定要等到米糧十分充足、才呌他們飽食、恐怕早已餓死了、所以我們現在先用（種灌米湯的辦法、暫時維持他們的生命、慢慢兒增加年限、充實内容一步一步的由簡而繁的做起來不必再等到經費師資等、完足以後再辦、</p>
<p>如果認爲這原則可以通得過、就想擬定幾條辦法、在江蘇指定幾縣試辦、或令某縣中指定幾處試辦、而同時並且要規定幾條簡單的强迫人學辦法、來試騐一下、</p>

<p>寧漢一致剷共。湖南馬日事變爲一大關鍵。馬日前。糊南有一大獄。聳動海内人士者。即葉德輝之被槍决是也。維時湖南黨政方在所謂左派之手。省城有特别法庭專爲裁判反動案件而設。以土豪劣紳被判死刑者。半年之間。已有二三十人之多。其中以槍决葉德輝最爲人所注目。蓋葉德輝之爲人。譽之者謂爲當今讀書種子。毀之者則詆爲現代文妖也。葉德輝被捕之夕。方由女伶某寓所歸來。來捕者係省農會自衛軍。即夕送往特别法庭。次晨即被槍决。蓋葉氏與武漢國民政府要人如譚畏公之流多爲舊識。又聞何鍵亦曾出其門下。在獄久羈。應致保釋。特别法庭委員某。兼省政府某廳長。爲葉氏學生。力主從速處决。於是葉氏以帝制餘孽。（曾爲湖南籌安分會會長）著各劣紳被誅矣。</p>
<p>葉氏未被捕時。嘗對人言。我非劣紳。乃是痞紳。痞子乃湘人詈無賴者之詞。類如滬語之所謂流氓。又嘗戲對人言。有人說我爲文妖。湖南並無文妖。只有字妖。一爲易寅村。一爲曹孟其。蓋易氏嗜金石。字有銀鈎鐵書之稱。曹氏擅古文。字則習北碑。參以顔法。上溯籇　自成一家。兩人皆與葉識。故葉氏乃爲此戲言也。葉氏好談房中術。蓄秘戲圖至夥。並著有雙梅景　叢書行世。嘗譏張競生談性藝爲外行。彼固以衷手自居也。</p>
<p>葉氏本爲蘇人。以寓湘久。故爲湘人。湘紳有兩麻子。自戊戍以來。即爲撫院以下當局所忌。一即葉麻子。一爲王麻子。王麻子爲王先謙。兩人皆爲翼教叢編中主要人物。而與戊戍湖南維新諸人爲難者也。</p>
<p>葉氏字煥彬。號郋園。著述甚多。蜚聲海内外。日本學者亦多推之。嘗自撰壽序。首句下筆即云國人皆曰可殺之葉德輝。後果以兇終。殆即所謂文讖歟。</p>

<p>秋水··</p>
<p>頃據日本通信。謂台灣島上最近發現一極富之金礦。發現者爲東京帝國大學工程科一教授杜可波里博士。Ｄr·Ｊisaburo　Tokobori博士研究礦學有年素有心得。此次旅行台灣。乃於無意之中。爲國家發見一空前之富源。其得意亦可想見矣。博士近携標本回國。一時朝野轟動。目爲盛事。有某報記者訪博士於其家。詢得詳情。刋之報章。乃譯而出之。以餉國人。須知台灣地域雖小。向爲我國屏藩。明末鄭成功之故事。當亦隠約在吾人腦海中也。不知其中利源。乃竟至不可以數計者。國有聞之。其亦有感於心乎。</p>
<p>金質約値五十萬萬元博士言。台灣藏金之富。殊覺不可思議。余此時極難下一確數。惟余自信。一至開掘之後。其總</p>
<p>數至少可値日金五十萬萬。其金礦即在台灣東部海岸離開倫哥Ｋarenko十五英里内之地。蔓延幾及一百五十英里地域之廣。亦足駭人也。</p>
<p>金沙沿街可得。其地金礦。均係包含於沙石之内。爲水所冲積而成。故地面上均有其蹝跡。余（博士自稱。在河　山中及平原上。亦均拾有金質之沙石。加以化騐。金之成分極富。即在市上之街道。亦時時可見此種金沙。余曾在一小村落中之小街。隨手拾得少許石。歸後騐之。居然亦含金質。台灣金礦之富可以想見。所謂隨地黃金垂手可拾者。台灣有之矣。故該處之金礦開掘極易。不若朝鮮及其他各處之金礦。非入地一百呎深之處。不見金苗。台灣金礦率皆浮於地面開掘實毫不費力。直至一百二十呎以下。方不見其蹝跡。殊爲東亞唯一之富源。亦世界上有史以來未有之藏金窟也。</p>
<h3 id="c188">眞實的戀愛悲劇　··電學 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>美國出版界中。有一本很風行的雜誌叫做［眞實的故事］。Ｔrue　Story這書中的材料。大都取着社會間所有的離奇的事實。而加以描寫與叙述。因爲眞的事實。總很入情入理。所以更能受人的歡迎。在這一個雜誌中的好的作品往往就成爲花蘭塢電影界影片的取材。像最近的［殺妻奇案］一片。也便是從這本雜誌中的小說改編而成的。</p>
<p>關於眞實的事攝製影片的。在我國電影界中也已數見不鮮。惟無論是歐美是我國。這種片的取材。大都偏重於戀愛的方面。而尤其是戀愛的悲劇方面。</p>
<p>像以前黃慧如陸根榮的戀愛案。便是一個很曲折的戀愛悲劇。所以明星影片公司曾經把他攝過一張黃陸之愛的影片。很受歡迎。馬振華汪世昌的戀愛案。情節雖很簡單。但確也是一個戀愛的悲劇。所以也有人家把他攝成影片。也很受歡迎。</p>
<p>我們知道悲劇的價値。在使人多能感動。而眞實的悲劇。則更因入情入理之故。而自然能激起觀者的同情心。攝製影片。最好用這種材料。</p>
<p>最近我國明星影片公司又有一張新片。呌做［一個紅蛋。］便也是取材於眞實的故事而編製的。據說在寗波很流傳這個故事。乃是說一個很賢慧的女郎。嫁了一個天閹的男子。不幸因爲人家生兒的一個紅蛋之故。竟使這個女郎無端的蒙寃死去。結果。使一個很好的家庭。充滿了悉雲慘霧。</p>
<p>我想起來。在這一張影片中。當然很能發揮着舊禮教的殘酷。和舊家庭間種種慘悽的景况的。那麽憑着事實的曲折。和銀色的煊染。一定能使人感受到緾綿而又悱惻的同情。</p>

<p>初夏清和。偏多風雨。内子以病後鄕居悶損。前日趁晴來錫。將縱覽湖山自廣。余與啜茗公園。綠陰深處。小憩片時。旋復偕往崇安寺前。隨意散步。並購置零星。此間百戲雜陳。百貨紛集。不啻蘇州之玄妙觀。常州之城隍廟也。塲側有市金魚者。清水一盆。數十尾游泳其中。悉現紅色。惟較大者兩尾深墨金黃。相間成采。爲狀尤可人。主者指曰。此龍種也。意頗居奇。内子絶愛憐之。遂索余納小銀幣四。得此一對珍物。欣然色喜。如獲宣予雙環。豐城兩劍也。主者復爲之盛以玻瓶。繫以綵絲。於是行則更番提携。坐則靜置案頭。觀其唼喋青藻。上下波光以爲樂。是夜宿旅邸。謂明日將携以還鄕。藉破空閨岑寂焉。及翌晨探之。則皆僵矣。内子驚出不意。相與苦究其病由。余笑曰。他姑勿論。即此小小之瓶。容量幾何。彼俩失盡自由。致英雄無用武地。而局促如轅下駒余早知其弗能久也。徒以重違卿意。聊取快一時耳。内子顰蹙曰。然則彼俩固活潑潑之鴛侣。儂愛之。而反以死之。將何以爲情耶。爰倩余爲辭以哀之曰。謫蓮臺之八瓣兮。出珠海之雙鱗。芙蓉其尾兮。瑇瑁其紋。琥珀其睛兮。珊瑚其身。乍凌波而修嫭兮。濯清漣以　明。旣燕娭其將逝兮。忽蟺糾以相迎。殪費文禽之窺鏡兮。迷離丹爵之燈。子美沿橋而佇望兮。坡仙拊檻以移情。余喜雙珠之並獲兮。胡曇　之一現。撫遺蛻以傷神兮。惜此豸之不見。豈鵒鴝踰濟而貊踰汶兮。信遷地之弗良耶。抑彩雲易散而花</p>

<p>瑪諦斯六十生辰（Ｄ）</p>
<p>諦斯從摩訶Ｍoreau和項勃蘭德Ｒembramdt的榜樣中解脫出來。他逐漸把［構圖的均衡］［調子的减降］等習慣的法則摒除了。他不因光暗所發生的［塑形］那般的凹凸而轉變書中的人物的臉孔。他全以濃色堆　的筆觸。線的巧妙。畫刀的刻劃。運用畫板上的色彩以裝餙的深味示人。</p>
<p>他注重純粹而不混和的色調。全以相等的密度安置於其不可交替之光質上。將他與瑪奈Ｅdouard　Monet藝術相比擬。是種觀感的極端。西湼克Ｐaul　Signao（新印象派的代表人物。現在還活着。是獨立展覽會的首領）在他的［由特拉克窪Ｄelacroix到新印象主義］書中。很合理地把法蘭西畫派的兩個時期間的嫡系說明過。但是他把最後的一程忽略了。其實。勝利的道路是由特拉克窪到瑪諦斯的這一條。瑪諦斯的色彩毫不根據科學的理論。却全憑着自我的觀察。情絡和感覺的經騐。像西湼克那些畫家。受着物拉克窪著作的刺戟。注意補色的原理。他那科學知識直使他在一定的色彩。瑪諦斯是努力用那能生自已感情的色调調。但是他的色調也有種必要的比例。有時因這一點便要將人物的形狀更動。結構也加以修改。因這些。所以二十年以前大家就稱他做野獸派的首領。其實野獸派的高超的着色就是他們的特色呢。</p>
<p>瑪諦斯在玻璃畫的意義上是色彩家。而在吕朋士Ｒubens（荷蘭大師善用艶麗之色調）的意義上則否。綫條走。出了色彩的範圍。他竟把色調冲破了。有如彈丸打破了玻璃的痕跡。使閱者有原始的繪畫之感。他那輸廓的平面的結構全是亞剌伯風。描綫的傾向韻律的規範在瑪諦斯的任何作品中塯有一種動的生力。有如通有電流的電綫。而這種原始的韻律使那形式有了一種系統活單純化。固爲描寫畸形的人物的誇張。常使他畫中的人物綜合而變形。瑪諦斯自已也說過。［假使畫一個女子的體軀。第一。要使她優美有意義。其餘的事便從這上面生出。依着主要的綫將那體軀的意味盡量的熬出來。驟然看去。表面上没甚魅力。却是在這種映像的裏面。充滿着更大更比人間的魅力會漸漸刺戟觀者的心。···］</p>
<p>瑪諦斯純是顧想綫形色彩構　的裝飾的效果來製作。他爲追求純粹的藝術靈感。極强烈的對照的色彩。在他六十生日過了以後。已於三月一日追踵着高更Ｇa</p>
<p>nguin到南非洲泰赫地島去了。我想今後他是定有許多讚美異鄕情調。表現南國風光的作品或者由這位天才的筆。使法蘭西的畫風翻弄到埃及的石刻那樣原始的作風。</p>

<p>新發現</p>
<p>柴霍甫生前未發表過的劇本　　托爾斯泰是很不喜歡柴霍甫所寫的那種劇本的、他曾經對柴霍甫說、［莎士比亞寫劇本已經寫得夠壞了、你却寫得比他還要壞、］</p>
<p>這話未免使人吃驚、但托爾斯泰自有托爾斯泰的道理、柴霍甫所發表過的一些劇本都是［不戲劇的］的戲劇、換句話說、都是靜的、缺少動的塲面和戲劇的情節的灰色的人物過着灰色的生活那使讀者或觀衆聳動的、不是强動活躍的行動、而是軟弱庸懦的性格、這就是柴霍甫劇本之能博得讀者們底同情（因而歡迎）的緣故、亦就是柴霍甫劇本和别人劇本不同的地方、亦就是托爾斯泰不喜歡柴霍甫劇本的主因、</p>
<p>柴霍甫底劇本是自成一派的、和他的小說自成一派一樣、但他並不是一開始寫劇本就成了這麽一派的、他是在許久的摸索以後才發現了抓住了他那特有的格調、其間是有過不少的發展和進步、這是看了他那部新近發現的遺稿就可以看出的、</p>
<p>柴霍甫底一部劇本新近被發現了、是以前没有發表過的、作者大概是以爲這部作品不能發表的、所以連題目都没有、因此原文版本出版時就叫做［一部未發表的劇本、柴霍甫作、］現在已經有人把它譯成英文了替它題发個名字叫［那個無用的人柏拉圖諾夫］（Ｔbat　Wortble</p>
<p>ss　Pellow　Platonov)、我們爲簡便起見把它稱爲［那個無用的人］吧、</p>
<p>翻開這個劇本來看的人、如果心裏存着想看到像［櫻桃園］［三姊妺］那樣的作品的心思、那是無疑地要失望的因爲這還是他的未成熟的作品、但、我們如果撇開了藝術來看、那末像這樣的發現是不常有的不能、不莫是可貴的了、並且技術、雖未達到完美的地步、作者底天才却已屢屢顯露在手法上、也頗有和他日後的成熟作品相像之處、這就可以使我們看到天才底進展、</p>
<p>［那個無用的人柏拉圖諾夫］是柴霍甫底戲劇家事業的起始、這是他第一次正正經經想寫戲劇所得的結果、因爲他以前雖然也嘗試過兩次、但是據我們所能知道的、這兩次都是帶着兒戲的態度、不能算爲正經的創作的、便是這個劇本、作於一八八○年的、那時柴霍甫也還祇有二十歲、尙在莫斯科大學念書、剛剛動手投稿各雜誌、來試騐他的文學天才、署名是那古怪的［安東夏·柴霍翁代］（Ａnto</p>
<p>sha　Cbckhonte)、他做的是一些滑稽的雜文和短篇小說、投稿的是一些第二三流的雜誌、他著作這部［柏拉圖拉夫］的時候、顯然是抱着很大的希望的、他夢想這劇本能在莫斯科的一家大劇塲開演、能使他在一夜之間由一個通俗的微末作家一躍而爲一個大作家、但是他送去這劇本以後、那劇塲的女主角不喜歡這個劇本、於是柴霍甫遵照了她的指示、動手來修改、但是他後來就將這劇本丢在一邊、中止了這件工作、爲什麽呢、是因爲他忙於學醫和寫滑稽作品賣錢而無暇及此呢、還是因爲這敏感胆怯的青年因被拒而覺得羞憤呢、我們可不知道、我們所知道的只是柴霍甫去世十九年以後、在一九二三年、從他的舊紙堆裏、這部作品被發現了、後來就在莫斯科出版、</p>
<p>在技術上、這個劇本是不完全的、但在形式上是完全的、他有整個的故事、故事底内容大略如此、米開爾伐苔葉維支柏拉圖諾夫是一個鄕間教師、性格是高尙的、而且骨子裏是道德的、可惜他對於女人的情慾太强烈了、而且天生没有决斷、没有或取或去的本事、碰着女人他就是一個没有辦法、走也不是、留也不是、旣不能有始終如一的思想、又不能有始終如一的行動、簡而言之、他除了軟綿綿的躺在沙發上、把自已窒息在那種優柔寡斷、自怨自責、飽含色情狂的氛圍氣以外、完全没有别的辦法、他是已經結婚了的、他的妻莎夏是忠貞而且温厚的、只給他幸福不給他痛苦、但是在智識上、她比他要低得多、所以他對於她不滿意、而她亦没有管束他的能力、於是他的情慾就去另尋出路了、因此攪出同時和三個女人戀愛的事情來、</p>
<p>第一個女性是安娜彼得洛芙娜、這是一個中年寡婦、看中他已經好久了的、他正要投向安娜的時候、忽然接到蘇菲亞底來信、因此弄得躊躇不决起來、蘇菲亞依谷洛芙娜是安娜底媳婦、柏拉圖洛夫在他未結婚以前就愛上了的、這時他就覺得事情難辦起來、正在没法之際、忽然又有一個女性跑進來干涉、這是瑪麗亞依菲莫芙娜、也是他的意中人之一、這一來、完全糟了、我們的這位柏拉圖洛夫就纏在這大糾紛裏、脫身不得、於是到了最後、我們看見他喝得爛醉了、被安娜、蘇菲亞、瑪麗亞包圍着、同時他的妻呢、據說已經呑了紅頭火柴、毒發將死了、蘇菲亞這時候恨極了、就拿起一把手槍、向柏拉圖諾夫放了一槍、没有放中、（這是俄國戲的老辦法）再放了一槍、才放死了他、於是這没辦法的無用之人給别人替他想出辦法來了、</p>
<p>這個劇本祇好說是悲劇、但有的地方實在發笑、這是柴霍甫底特色、在一篇未成熟的作品裏、也已經有些顯露出來的、並且這個劇本裏很有一些日後的成熟作品的胚胎、彷彿日後的那些成熟作品都是從這個劇本裏長大出來似的、譬如主人公柏拉圖諾夫底那種没有希望、毫無意志、而又神經衰弱的性格、就是和柴霍甫日後所作的［伊凡諾夫］底主人公非常相像的、要不是情節不同、我們簡直可以說［伊凡諾夫］就是這個劇本的改作了、再如成爲劇中一大部份的背景的伏音濟夫貴族家庭、環繞在這個家庭底窮困和没落的四周的那種感傷的氛圍氣、顯然就是［櫻桃園］中所流露的基要情調的胚胎、諸如此類的相似之處很不少、</p>
<p>這是顯然的、在日後技術成熟完美之時所有的種情調、主題、人物、在二十歲的時候是就已經結晶了、在這一點、［柏拉圖諾夫］得到了他的價値、</p>

<p>關於［現代丹麥文學］、上面約略說過了、在丹麥的文壇上、我們可以總括起來說、是呈有兩種特别的現象、第一種是大多數作家、都描寫本鄕的風土人情和農民生活的苦痛、第二種是一部作品的成功多在數萬字之上的、作者也是費了幾所以上的工夫、才産生一部巨著、</p>
<h3 id="c193">文壇雜話 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>哥德和席勒的交情</p>
<p>哥德開始和席勒見面、是在一七七九年他正是三十歲的時候、但至有說話的機會、則還在一七八八年他三十九歲時的夏天、是和王泰尹同在羅特爾泰脫遊玩的時候、</p>
<p>此後他俩的交情、至死也没有脫離過温厚的狀態、所以他俩交情之深切和熱烈、實是在所有文學家的歷史上是稍有的、不過他俩是有相反的性格和境遇、在當時的德國簡直可說處于二十人競爭者的地位、</p>
<p>他俩性格的不同、同樣的容貌也就完全相異、哥德有寬闊的額角、和凹進着的巨大的眼睛、他的堂堂的風姿、一看就可以想起他的偉大來席勒的面貌好像恰和哥德相反、他是有一個瘦瘦的臉、眼睛却是爛爛有光、並且頭頸還是細而又長、要是俯下步行時、那就好似一只在走路的駱駝、</p>
<p>哥德喜歡清潔、新鮮的空氣、願意住光線充足的房子、但席勒却反有爛蘋菓的香味是動不起筆的、</p>
<p>哥德要在清朝動筆、而席勒則須經過深夜裏珈琲和香檳的刺戟以後、才可以動身寫字、</p>
<p>席勒比哥德小十歲、但比哥德要先死、他死於一八○五年五月九日、享年是六十又四歲、當時淮依馬爾的劇場因此停止而表示哀悼、人們聽到了這個不幸的消息、誰都要驚嘆這位天才之死的、</p>
<p>當時哥德也久已病臥着、所以不能去慰問病中的老友、直到席勒死後、也没有誰敢去報告哥德、因爲他自已也已年老而在病臥中、受不起愛友死亡的悲悼、那時同住者得到了消息、就到室外來商量是否要報告、但哥德却早知有異而問道、</p>
<p>［知道了、是否席勒危險了、他說了這句話後就不絶的嘆息着、當晚、老哥德的室内、特别的寂靜、翌晨、一個女子到哥德的房裏時、他就好像很悲傷的問、</p>
<p>「昨天以爲席勒是危險了、是眞的麽」、</p>
<p>那時女子見了哥德的悉憂的臉色、已不知是如何回答的好、於是在不知不覺間就拿了手怕掩着臉哭起來了、</p>
<p>哥德看了這樣的態度、當然就完全明白、於是就叫着、</p>
<p>［呀、席勒死了麽、］</p>
<p>［是的、］</p>
<p>女子就且哭且答、</p>
<p>［呀、席勒死了麽、］</p>
<p>哥德連叫了二遍、就拿手去遮住他就要湧出眼淚的眼睛、</p>
<p>哥德比席勒多活兩年、是一八三二年三月二日逝世的、葬在席勒的墓旁他俩雖已死去、但靈魂的軀殼還是放置在一起、（平）</p>

<h3 id="e5">Tense Relations Between Italy and France <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>One of the greatest crises in the world today is the decline of commerce, the increase in unemployment, and the endless disputes between capitalists and workers. Another is that the colonized peoples of colonial countries are striving for liberation, while the countries that have invaded them are unwilling to give up the rights they have already seized. This also leads to endless conflicts. The third is the European nations' ambition for hegemony, which continues to rise and fall without ceasing. Before the European War, all countries tried their best to deal with Germany. Today, after the European War, they may try their best to deal with Italy. The tension between France and Italy has intensified since the London Naval Conference, becoming increasingly evident. The responsible persons of both countries have issued important declarations, much like the attitude between Germany and France before the European War. If this continues without a good way to mediate between them, a second European war may not be far off. However, compared to Germany in the past, Italy today does not rely solely on military force, believing in certain victory, and therefore does not pay much attention to diplomacy, resulting in many enemies. Italy, while focusing on strength, also took advantage of its cooperation with the Allied powers during the European War against the strong enemy Germany. It has also been able to maneuver among the various European countries. Furthermore, France's relationship with the major powers is not as close as it was before the European War. Therefore, not to mention the relationship with the world, if we only consider Europe, France's current situation with Italy is even more difficult than it was with Germany in the past.</p>

<p>Associated Press, Lakehurst Naval Air Station, 31st: Dr. Eckener calmly brought the Zeppelin airship safely to land at this naval air station this morning. After being unable to smoke for days due to piloting the airship, he smoked a cigarette before speaking with reporters, recounting the obstacles the airship encountered near Bona Bai Ge North. He said that when the Zeppelin crossed Bormat, it encountered strong headwinds, which were more dangerous than anything previously experienced. If the Zeppelin had not been so strong, it would have been unable to withstand the conditions. After escaping the danger, a detailed inspection of the ship was conducted, and fortunately, there was no damage. The doctor is scheduled to depart for home on Sunday evening or Monday morning and is currently preparing to refuel. This trip was specially permitted by the U.S. government to carry several bottles of wine to be used for meals after leaving U.S. territory.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Friedrichshafen, 31st: According to a telegram from Lakehurst, the Graf Zeppelin is scheduled to depart across the Atlantic for Germany on Monday night. Since its first transatlantic flight in the autumn of 1928, the ship has flown 150,000 kilometers.</p>

<p>He Chengjun Offers 200,000 Yuan Reward</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: After the Central Army surrounded Xuchang from three directions along the Pinghan Railway, the Northwestern Army troops of Zhang Weixi and Fan Zhongxi, under Ren Yingqi, were defeated. Zhangdian Street and Xuchang South Gate Station were also captured by the Central Army. At dawn on the 30th, the Central Army continued their fierce attack with intense artillery fire, completely routing the enemy at Zhangdian Street and capturing four regimental commanders and six battalion commanders. The army then advanced directly to the city. Shangguan Yunxiang's forces, who had originally attacked the south gate of Xuchang, now that the south gate had been retaken and the enemy's strategic points lost, detoured to attack the north gate, advancing to Wumeng Village, five miles from the north gate of Xuchang. They intercepted a unit of Zhang Weixi's army transporting supplies north from Xuchang, capturing three regimental commanders and five battalion commanders. He Chengjun received reports of these battles at Dashiqiao that day and immediately went to Xuchang, inspecting the city walls for a week. Knowing that the defending troops in the city had no fighting ability, he ordered the air force to send five planes and the armored car team, Minsheng and Xiping, to cooperate with the divisions in closely monitoring the enemy in the city and to retake Xuchang immediately. The main body of the army advanced north beyond Xuchang. The main force of the Northwestern Army was still concentrated in the strategic area of Heshang Bridge, which is close to Xinzheng. He Chengjun, recognizing the strategic importance of the location, as its seizure would allow Xinzheng and Zhengzhou to be taken without a fight, offered a reward of 200,000 yuan to encourage the troops to advance. Cao Zhenwu, Lu Peilie, Fan Yunpu, and others were appointed as judges to ensure fairness. It is expected that there will be a fierce battle in the area within the next day or two (May 31st).</p>
<h3 id="e46">Jiangsu Provincial Party Consolidation Committee Requests Salary Cuts for Civil Servants and Raises for Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>At its 42nd meeting, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Consolidation Committee passed a motion to petition the Central Government to reduce the salaries of civil servants and increase the salaries of elementary school teachers. The reasons have now been detailed and submitted to the Central Government for consideration. The petition states: "[Since our Party established the country, it has been several years. Administrative expenses have increased compared to the past, but achievements remain minimal. When expenditures are insufficient, they are taken from the people, and the people's suffering has not been alleviated, while their burdens have gradually increased. This is why there are proposals for austerity policies and the promotion of thrift. The most extravagant expenditure, accounting for 50-60% of the total, is the salaries of internal staff. In addition to these salaries, there are so-called office expenses, transportation expenses, and subsidies. Although the Central Government has explicitly prohibited them, they continue to be paid. Furthermore, various unnecessary miscellaneous expenses, when combined, account for another 20-30%. How much is left to be used for productive endeavors? Corrupt individuals then exploit these funds. Thus, agencies that spend tens of thousands of dollars annually have magnificent buildings and hundreds of officials, but what achievements have they demonstrated in the things that should be established and reformed? This is truly the misfortune of the country and a crisis for the future of party rule. Now, let us take the salary standards of civil servants and compare them with those of military officers who risk their lives on the battlefield, fighting to quell disturbances, support the vulnerable, secure the country, and resist foreign aggression. The military officers pale in comparison. When compared with party workers who lead the people, promote revolution, and realize ideology, the party workers pale in comparison. Our armed comrades and party workers have always taken sacrifice as their duty, seeking only enough to maintain their livelihoods. We will set this aside for now. But how can we compare them with elementary school teachers, who are related to cultivating healthy citizens, nurturing talent, and determining the fate of the country, when the disparity in their treatment is so great that it cannot be measured? The General has said, 'What we need to solve now is not the problem of comfort, nor the problem of luxury, but only the problem of needs.' Today's elementary school teachers lecture and instruct, wearing out their tongues and voices. With the meager resources they earn throughout the year, they cannot support their dependents, nor can they save for the future. In fact, they are not even able to meet their personal needs. Compared with the salary of a clerk in a government agency, which is nearly 200 yuan per month, or the salary of a section chief, which exceeds 300 yuan per month, their duties are often leisurely, and some simply clock in and do nothing all day. Their lives are spent in grand buildings, feasting on delicacies, wearing brocade, riding in luxurious cars, and issuing orders, with their official seals piled high. The extravagant consumption of one person exceeds the comfortable resources of thousands, and the comfortable resources of one person exceed the necessary expenses of thousands. Mencius said, 'In the kitchen, there is fatty meat; in the stable, there are fat horses; the people have a hungry look; in the fields, there are starving corpses. This is leading beasts to eat people.' Du Fu's poem says, 'Behind the vermillion gates, the smell of wine and meat reeks; by the roadside, there are frozen corpses.' Thinking of this, how can we not be alarmed? Moreover, the purpose of our Party's revolution is to seek the welfare of the majority of the people. Ask, which is more numerous in a county: elementary school teachers or civil servants? Which is more numerous in a province: elementary school teachers or civil servants? And which is more numerous in the country: elementary school teachers or civil servants? If the salaries of all civil servants in the country could be reduced across the board, and the savings used to improve the treatment of elementary school teachers, the civil servants would not be harmed in the slightest, while the elementary school teachers across the country would benefit greatly. Yet now, the hardships and difficulties of millions of people are ignored, while only the comfort and luxury of hundreds or thousands of people are sought. Not only is there no way to justify this, but it will also disappoint the people of the world. This is not only morally inappropriate, but also logically inconsistent. Furthermore, imparting knowledge to the people, cultivating the people's abilities, and instilling character in the people—all of these depend on education. Education is truly the foundation of the country and a crucial plan for saving it, and elementary school education is particularly essential for basic national training. The importance of the responsibilities of elementary school teachers cannot be overemphasized. In recent years, the number of elementary schools in various places has indeed increased, but in terms of quality, there has been no significant progress. This is because the treatment of elementary school teachers is too meager, and the general public has little interest in elementary school education. Even teacher training students who have not yet graduated often see elementary school teaching as a daunting path, and those who are currently working as elementary school teachers regard it as a burden. If they can find another way, they will all leave without hesitation. If they have the mindset of spending only a few days in the capital, how can they be expected to make plans for a hundred years of nurturing talent? If we do not quickly seek remedies, what will the future hold? The salaries of civil servants should be reduced, and the treatment of elementary school teachers should be improved. The theory has been briefly exhausted above. Now, let us speak in terms of facts. It is human nature to prefer leisure and dislike poverty. Leisure and pleasure lead to licentiousness, while poverty leads to desperation. Today's civil servants are wealthy, and their salaries far exceed what they need for comfort. Thus, they indulge in extravagance and do whatever they please, as if their salaries were intentionally designed to corrupt them. But what about today's elementary school teachers? Their monthly salary is nominally over 20 yuan, but in reality, some receive only five or six yuan, and some are owed for more than half a year without receiving a penny. Given the high cost of living, how can they maintain their livelihoods with such meager amounts, preventing their eyes from wandering and their minds from straying? Anti-revolutionary elements can then use their silver tongues to incite and tempt them. Lu You wrote, 'A young man cannot travel a hundred miles; hunger can make him travel to the ends of the earth.' These are factual words, not meant to be alarmist. Moreover, small men flock to where the profits are. An official returns home with a thousand strings of cash, which he can use to enjoy his old age and live a carefree life. This makes it difficult to realize a clean government, and repeated orders and injunctions are not enough to stop the trend of competition and pursuit of official positions. For now, the only plan is to quickly change course, reduce the salary standards of civil servants to a level that can meet their needs and allow for some comfort, and improve the treatment of elementary school teachers to a level that can sustain their lives and prevent them from going hungry and cold. This is the way to prevent corruption, seek mutual benefit, and ensure a comprehensive plan. Your committee, in the face of difficult times, is filled with concern and dares to speak its mind. Therefore, it has been resolved at the 42nd meeting of the committee to petition your association to reduce the salaries of civil servants and increase the treatment of elementary school teachers. We have now laid out our views in detail and respectfully request that you consider and implement them. The future of the Party and the country will truly benefit from this."</p>

<h3 id="e48">Guangdong Province to Abolish Likin in October <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Gambling Banned Only After Military Operations End</p>
<p>Entry Tax on Fruit Products Abolished by Explicit Order</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The National Government has explicitly ordered the abolition of likin throughout the country on October 10th of this year and has telegraphed the financial commissioners and finance departments of various provinces to prepare plans for abolishing likin in their respective provinces. Specialists, carrying plans, will be sent to Beijing before May 30th to discuss everything in person. The provinces were also ordered to telegraph Beijing in advance for verification of the total annual income of all likin taxes and similar likin taxes, broken down into individual items and total amounts. The Guangdong provincial finance authorities have reported all likin and similar likin taxes in the province to the provincial government. As for gambling, it will be banned only after military operations are completely concluded. The provincial government, based on the report, consulted the Ministry of Interior yesterday, stating, "[We now acknowledge your ministry's Police Character No. 321 consultation stating that the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan has forwarded a letter from Party member Li Yaohuan requesting the removal of customs barriers and likin and the prohibition of opium and gambling, and requested that it be handled separately. In addition, we have copied the section attached by Party member Li Yaohuan on prohibiting opium and gambling to eliminate the source of chaos and ensure the livelihood of the people. Upon investigation, we found that the Anti-Opium Commission previously sent a consultation with similar content, which was ordered to be reviewed and reported by the Finance Department and then forwarded for review. The Finance Department replied, 'Regarding the abolition of likin, the Finance Department received an order from your office No. 354 in February of this year, and the Executive Yuan approved a letter from the Civil Service Department of the National Government, which ordered that from October 10th of this year, all likin and similar likin taxes throughout the country will be abolished. We should comply with this order and implement it when the time comes. As for gambling, due to the ongoing suppression of the rebellion and the urgent need for funds, we have no choice but to rely on gambling revenue to meet the expenses. Once the military operations are concluded, we will ban it. The prohibition of opium is under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Anti-Opium Bureau, and the Finance Department cannot comment on it. Due to the previous orders, we have reported to your office for review and await further instructions.' We believe that the reliance on gambling revenue to maintain military expenses is a factual situation and should be forwarded to the Anti-Opium Commission for review. As the Anti-Opium Bureau is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, whether it should be prohibited and should be reviewed by the Ministry of Finance and then instructed to the Finance Department for notification and forwarded to the Anti-Opium Commission for review. Based on the previous consultation, we have written a document reporting the handling situation and hope you will review it. Currently, the annual income from various likin taxes in Guangdong Province is approximately 5.7 million yuan. The fees for sitting likin platforms is approximately 1.5 million yuan. The various government and county taxes similar to likin is approximately 1.62 million yuan. The Guangdong financial commissioner and the finance department director Fan Qiwu have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to verify this. Recently, the Finance Department has begun to abolish these likin taxes based on their urgency. The Guangzhou Municipal Government has a collection of taxes on fruits, which have been collected since the 20th of this month, after the contract with the merchants expired, has been explicitly canceled by the Finance Department and will no longer be contracted to merchants.

<h3 id="e49">Recent Financial Situation in Guangdong Province <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Decision to Redeem Principal and Pay Interest on Military Treasury Bonds Next Month</p>
<p>Bank of China Implements Exchange for 100 Yuan Banknotes</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Recently, with the conclusion of the war in Guangxi Province, a comfortable situation has suddenly emerged in Guangdong's financial circles. In the past, during the military period, the Bank of China's banknotes experienced several storms, and only the one-yuan banknotes could be fully used in the market. The remaining five-yuan, ten-yuan, fifty-yuan, and up to one hundred-yuan banknotes were discounted to seventy percent. During the military period, the total value of banknotes above five yuan could not exceed the aforementioned price. Now that the war has ended, most bankers believe that the war has come to an end, and the political situation will stabilize accordingly. Therefore, they are collecting the Bank of China's five-yuan and other denominations at high prices. Manipulators are taking advantage of the opportunity to raise their value. As a result, five-yuan and above Bank of China banknotes gradually increased from seventy percent to ninety percent as of yesterday (the 23rd). The main reason for the financial community to raise the price of Bank of China banknotes is that the government recently decided to implement lottery redemption of principal and interest for the issued military treasury bonds next month (June). At the same time, maturing treasury bonds will also be paid in full. In order to cope with the payment of the above treasury bonds, the government had no choice but to first restore the redemption of central banknotes above one yuan in order to facilitate turnover. Speculators predicted this trend and judged that the government would inevitably issue a policy to restore the redemption of banknotes above one yuan. Therefore, they scrambled to collect them, and as a result, the Bank of China notes above five yuan have continued to increase in value for days, from seventy percent to ninety percent. Now that this phenomenon exists, the government will not have much difficulty in preparing cash, even if it implements the restoration of any kind of banknote. First, Fan Qiwu, the Director of the Department of Finance of the Provincial Government, Huang Jusu, Sun Xiwu, and Qu Guoqiang, the Governor of the Bank of China, were dispatched by the Provincial Government to prepare for the redemption of Bank of China banknotes. Yesterday, the Provincial Government issued a clear order to the Department of Finance and the Bank of China to first restore the redemption of one hundred-yuan banknotes on the 26th. The remaining five-yuan, ten-yuan, and fifty-yuan Bank of China banknotes will also be redeemed successively in the shortest possible time. After the one-hundred-yuan banknotes are redeemed, the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes can also be redeemed in succession within five or six days. (May 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Chen Peikun, Gan Yun, and Others Arrive in Fujian <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Chen Peikun recently went to Shanghai from Xiamen, and then returned to Fujian from Shanghai. It is said that when Chen passed through Xiamen, he negotiated a loan of 70,000 yuan with various parties, using the consolidated consumer goods bureau as collateral. Three thousand yuan has already been delivered, and the remaining 40,000 yuan will be remitted successively. The political expenses to be issued for the Dragon Boat Festival are only 50,000 yuan short. The military expenses are handled by the Special Finance Office. As for Chen's concurrent positions as Director of Civil Affairs and Director of Finance, it is said that if the central government and Chairman Yang urge him further, he may reluctantly take on the position of Director of Civil Affairs. However, since Li Chengyi's resignation as Director of Finance has not yet been approved, he should be urged to come to Fujian immediately to avoid interruption of government affairs.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Party Commissioners Gan Yun, Chen Lianfang, and Kang Shaozhou also arrived in the province yesterday. It is heard that Gan and others will start by sorting out the Party affairs in Fujian Province in the future, so that the Provincial Party Headquarters can be formally established as soon as possible. Since the Party Headquarters in Fujian Province has been openly active since the 15th year of the Republic of China, it is still in the preparatory period. The central government hopes that the Provincial Party Headquarters will be completed soon. As for the local Party Headquarters in various counties, whether they have been formally established or are still in the guidance period, those that are sound will continue as usual, and those with disputes will be re-assigned personnel for guidance. The appointment of new commissioners will be implemented only after the establishment of the new Provincial Government. (May 28th)</p>

<p>Two Shop Assistants of Dejucheng Money Shop Shot Dead</p>
<p>More Than 1,100 Yuan in Banknotes Stolen</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: At 8:30 p.m. on the 27th, two robbers, both in their twenties, wearing blue short jackets and top hats, suddenly entered the Dejucheng Money Shop in Quanshang Market on Market Road 3 while the accounts were being settled. They closed the door and said they wanted to exchange money. Then, they took out pistols and ordered shop assistants Wang Zhizuo and Ma Xijun to quickly go up to the top bunk. Ma then jumped out of the window and shouted. Hearing the warning, the robbers shot Ma in the abdomen. At that time, shopkeeper Ma Xihe was calling at the door outside. The robbers opened the door and shot and killed the shopkeeper Ma, one shot to the head, two shots to the abdomen, and one shot to the left hand, for a total of four wounds. At the same time, they snatched 1,110 yuan in silver dollars from the drawer and fled. After hearing the gunshots, the police on Market Road 3 rushed to the scene to investigate. Seeing that a murder had occurred, they immediately blew the whistle to warn and reported to the branch. The patrol officer of the branch led the police to the scene, but the robbers had already fled. A search was conducted in all directions, but no trace was found. The case was immediately reported to the branch bureau and then to the general bureau. The injured Ma Xi was sent to Qingdao Hospital for treatment and died in the hospital at 11:15 p.m. That night, Wu Tingzhang, the prosecutor of the local court, arrived to examine the body and prepare the coffin. The Public Security Bureau has ordered its subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation and strive to solve the case. Market Road 3 is a prosperous street in Qingdao City. Such a serious case of murder and robbery occurred in the evening, and local security suddenly felt terrorized. (May 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e52">Disaster Situation in Shaanxi and Recent News on Disaster Relief <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>More Than 60,000 People Died in Qian County</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan Transports Rice to Lingbao</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaanxi Province is becoming more and more serious. The following is a quick telegram report from the Shaanxi Disaster Information Agency on the current situation and the disaster relief efforts of Zhu Qinglan and others. We hope philanthropists will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(1) Qian County in Shaanxi Province is located on a plateau and has no land for irrigation. Last autumn, there was no harvest, and summer wheat has not yet been planted. The entire territory originally had a population of 169,498, and 61,634 have died. Four-tenths have demolished houses and sold them. There are households without any relatives in every village. There are nearly thirty villages with no human habitation. There have been three rains this year, and weeds grow everywhere on the wasteland. Many disaster victims who dig up weeds to prolong their lives develop swelling and die. No one buries them, resulting in the spread of epidemics. People are dying from starvation and epidemics. Although the Xiaohui Learning Society of Beiping has come to the county twice to distribute relief and has set up soup kitchens and shelters, it is a drop in the bucket, and only one percent is saved. Seeing the desolate scene, one's hair stands on end. The Shaanxi Disaster Information Agency bows in ashes.</p>
<p>(2) Philanthropist Zhu Qinglan left Xi'an early in the morning and returned east to transport seeds. He arrived in Zhengzhou on the 22nd and telegraphed Liu Yufen, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and Deng Changyao, Chairman of the Relief Committee, saying that 3,000 bags of corn seeds would arrive in Lingbao on the 24th. Please find a way to hire cars to transport them so that they can be delivered quickly. After receiving the telegram, Chairman Liu immediately sent Deputy Adjutant Ma and Mayor Yang to prepare cars. On the 23rd and 24th, the two chairmen, Liu and Deng, convened a meeting in the province with the managers of the Automobile Administration Bureau and more than 20 automobile companies to discuss the plan. The personnel of the automobile companies were grateful for the enthusiasm of Zhu and the provincial authorities in disaster relief and were willing to assist with all their strength. They jointly decided on several points: (1) The seed transportation fee will be reduced by half, 6 yuan per bag. (2) Cars will depart for transportation from the 1st. (3) Please allocate a car and a passport from the provincial government. (4) The number of bags transported by each car company will be registered on the passport each time. After the transportation is completed, the passport will be returned and a completed transportation license will be issued. (5) No matter whether it is a public or commercial car company, if there is no completed transportation license to carry passengers and goods, the car will be detained and not allowed to pass. (6) The amount of grain transported will be calculated according to the car's load. A one-ton car can transport 40 bags (transported in four trips), and a ton and a half car can transport 60 bags. It is expected that the transportation can be completed in about 10 days. On the 18th, the Chang'an Relief Sub-Committee of the Provincial Relief Committee sent personnel to assist in distributing the passports and transportation fees to each car company clearly overnight, and they set off the next morning. In addition, Mr. Shang Yunting and Zhang Huanhai, the representatives of Zhu in Xi'an, also sent a letter on the 23rd to the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, the Red Cross Society, the Jisheng Sub-Committee, the Red Swastika Society, and other charitable organizations to discuss the seed distribution plan. It was decided to distribute seeds to the fifteen counties with severe disasters: Liquan, Pucheng, Sanyuan, Gaoling, Weinan, Mei County, Chang'an, Fufeng, Qishan, Jingyang, Qian County, Xingping, Zhouzhi, Xianyang, and Lintong. The Shaanxi Disaster Information Agency bows on the 1st.</p>
<p>(3) The Beijing China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, in view of the extraordinarily serious disaster situation in Shaanxi, has specially sent Arlington to Shaanxi to investigate the past disaster situation and survey the current disaster situation. Arlington has arrived in Yu H in the province. Although he is 72 years old, he is still energetic. He has been in China for more than 50 years and has assisted Li Hongzhang and Zhang Zhidong in handling confidential matters for many years. He has held important positions in the Ministry of Transportation of our country. In recent days, he has completed the investigation of the disaster situation in the vicinity of the provincial capital. He took a car to Xianyang, Xingping, Liquan, and other counties in the west of the province to conduct an on-site survey of the disaster situation early in the morning. In addition, Zhang Huanhai, Zhu Qinglan's representative in Shaanxi, also set off early in the morning to inspect disasters and provide relief in Liquan and Fufeng counties. In addition, Zhang Xianqing of the Shanghai Jisheng General Assembly went to Wugong to distribute emergency relief and seeds. The Shaanxi Disaster Information Agency bows on the 25th.</p>

<p>According to news from Xikang, Ms. Liu Manqing, a secretary of the National Government, who was dispatched to Tibet for investigation last year, started her journey last year. When she traveled to a place 200 miles away from Ba'an via Ba'an, she was stopped by Tibetan bandits. After several negotiations, she was finally allowed to pass. She arrived in Lhasa on April 12. The Dalai Lama expressed his great welcome. It is heard that Ms. Liu will also go to the eastern entrance of the Himalayas to investigate the details of Nepal's invasion of Tibet. It is a groundbreaking move for a weak woman to go to the extreme border and work hard for the country.</p>

<p>Harbin Correspondence: Turmoil has occurred in the coastal region of Russia. According to Russian sources here, about several thousand anti-Soviet troops have gathered in the Ivanov and Mengnaisi areas. They have now invaded the Lazodori and Yefukanyika stations. The Soviet Russian political authorities are now secretly dispatching spies in all directions to investigate the inside information of the anti-Soviet group and its external methods. On May 18, the anti-Soviet group robbed the Soviet Russian garrison headquarters' supply team of bread and other foods in large quantities near Lazodori. Small anti-Soviet groups have also been found near Shatucheng, Woxingcheng, and Weibu. Therefore, the Weibu area is extremely tense. The Soviet Russian authorities have now implemented martial law in the port and its vicinity. According to the Soviet Russian Das Telegraph Agency, the passenger and freight cars attached to the locomotive No. 80 on the Ussuri Road derailed suddenly near the station of Kudolsk, resulting in many deaths and injuries. It is heard that the reason was that the anti-Soviet group secretly destroyed the railway. The anti-Soviet group of about 100 people in the area are moving in and out of the small mountains and forests. Nearby farmers have expressed their welcome and supplied them with matches and food. The Suchang Coal Mine, the largest in the Far East, has almost completely stopped working. Although the Red Army sent to suppress the anti-Soviet group drove out a part of it, recently anti-Soviet groups in [Siergeyev], [Frolokov], [Kekagongka] and other places may concentrate on Suchang as a base in the near future. In the [Right-wing Suke] and [Ima Alanulno] areas of the coastal region, although the Red Army is suppressing them, half of them were surrounded and killed by the anti-Soviet group, and half surrendered to the anti-Soviet group. In addition, farmers and workers in the northern Xiang area of ​​Ussuri Railway also rose up to riot against the Soviet Russian authorities. Although it did not succeed, they were always rising up, and the momentum was very large. As for the military weapons used, most of them were knives, axes, and guns seized from the Red Army. Judging from the current situation, it is feared that the Soviet authorities will not be able to clean it up easily for a while. (May 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e55">A Letter of Blood and Tears from All Chinese Merchants Living in Mongolia <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>

<p>Chinese merchants in Mongolia are unable to bear the heavy taxes and duties. Recently, some businesses have reported that they are closing down. The Mongolian authorities have stated that if they report that they are closing down, they will not be allowed to remit money when the Far Eastern Bank resumes business, even if the Chinese and Mongolian governments have a proper solution, they will not be allowed to operate again. Some businesses have no way to raise money for special taxes and duties, so they beg the Mongolian authorities to allow them to pay the taxes and duties in kind. The Mongolian authorities immediately accused the businesses of deliberately violating their regulations, confiscated all the goods of the businesses, and ordered the merchants to leave the country quickly. The types and amounts of taxes and duties are briefly recorded below. Silk fabrics, tobacco, and cosmetics are taxed at 30 per cent of their value. Leather goods, magnetic wooden utensils are taxed at 15 per cent of their value. Copper, iron, tin, and sugar are taxed at 16 per cent of their value.

The salary donation is 120 yuan per year for the person in charge of the business, and 30 yuan per year for the staff. The business license donation is divided into eight grades: the special grade is not limited to the number of people, and is 9,000 yuan per year; the first grade is not limited to the number of people, and is 4,500 yuan per year; the second grade is not limited to the number of people, and is 2,500 yuan per year; the third grade is limited to 12 people, and is 1,500 yuan per year; the fourth grade is limited to 8 people, and is 1,000 yuan per year; the fifth grade is limited to 6 people, and is 500 yuan per year; the sixth grade is limited to 4 people, and is 250 yuan per year; the seventh grade is limited to 2 people, and is 150 yuan per year. The capital donation is 25 yuan per 1,000 yuan. The flow donation is 12 per cent per year. The actual number is multiplied by three or five times, and the donation bureau can estimate the increase at will. The bonus donation is 50 per cent per year. Regardless of whether there is any surplus profit, the bonus of 150 yuan per 1,000 yuan is estimated according to the amount of flow. The doorplate donation is divided into eight grades: the special grade is 1,200 yuan per year; the first grade is 800 yuan per year; the second grade is 600 yuan per year; the third grade is 300 yuan per year; the fourth grade is 200 yuan per year; the fifth grade is 150 yuan per year; the sixth grade is 100 yuan per year; the seventh grade is 80 yuan per year.

In addition, the donation for people living in the house is 15 yuan per room per year, the donation for storage rooms is 30 yuan per room per year, and the donation for kitchens is 5 yuan per room per year. The degree of donation is 3 yuan per pair for rulers. The large scale is 30 yuan per year, and the small scale is 8 yuan per year. The tobacco license donation is 120 yuan per year for all kinds of tobacco sold in whole, and 80 yuan for those sold in retail. To sum up, we Chinese people in Outer Mongolia have long been unbearable under the political and economic aggression of the red imperialism. However, the property and goods of the Mongolian business trip are still as high as 540 million yuan, according to a reliable survey. They are all blocked and cannot be cleaned up. They can only die. In addition to the direct and indirect losses suffered by Mongolian businesses and northwestern ports, and there will be no survivors, the number of Chinese and foreign goods exported to the outside of the country from Tianjin and Tianjin in the past was very large. Now, once it is stopped, Tianjin and Tianjin businesses will also suffer a major blow. Although there is no clear survey of tax revenue, the sharp reduction in imports and exports will inevitably have a major impact on revenue. In general, Outer Mongolia is a large sales market for our country's goods and a large source of money in the Northwest. Its relationship with our prosperity and decline is truly not superficial. Our Mongolian merchants are in dire straits and cannot live or die. There is no response to crying out to the heavens, and no response to calling out to the earth. We can only plead with patriotic and people-saving people from all walks of life to speak out in unison and urge the authorities to quickly take measures to provide relief, so as to protect the country's territory and relieve the people's suffering. China is fortunate, all northwestern ports are fortunate, and all Mongolian merchants are fortunate. Sincerely, all overseas Chinese merchants in Mongolia,</p>

<p>Police Unit Suppresses Bandits in Shazhou: Regarding the case of five men and women kidnapped from the home of Ma Yunbin, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Baimao Estuary, Dongwu District, it is now known that Ma Yunbin, who was kidnapped, and his student Gu Rulong, were shot and killed during the military and police suppression. His younger brother, Ai Ru, escaped from the bandit den on the night of the 30th. Previously, the water and land police unit stationed in Shazhou learned on the evening of the 29th that several bandit boats were anchored in Tiehuangsha in the middle of the river. Wang Kunshan, the director of the county's Public Security Bureau, led more than 40 members of the box cannon team and the police unit, together with patrol boats from the waterborne public security team of Districts 3 and 4, and agreed to gather at Xigang in Shazhou on the night of the 30th to prepare for the suppression. They also telegraphed various armed groups in Nantong to request that they lead troops and police to assist in blocking the escape routes. At 4:00 AM the next morning, the team set off and encountered bandit boats on the Jiangbian, east of Haitan, in Wenxingsha, and immediately opened fire. After about two hours of fierce fighting, the bandits were unable to withstand the pressure and fled in their boats. The police unit rescued four hostages, killed more than 20 bandits, captured two boats, and captured seven or eight bandits. It was also learned that a bandit named Chen Junshan fled to Shazhou during the rout and was captured by the armed group stationed in Shazhou.</p>
<p>Purchase of Firearms Encountered Difficulties: For the sake of defending the locality, the county government had ordered firearms from the Yali Foreign Firm in Shanghai. It has recently been learned that these firearms will soon be shipped to Shanghai. The county specially commissioned Lu Baozhong, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, and Wu Xinheng, the head of District 1, to take documents to Shanghai to pick them up. Unexpectedly, when the firearms passed through the Jianghai Customs by ship, they were not allowed to be transported ashore because they only had a provincial government passport and not a national government passport. The ship was anchored on the river bank at Jianghai Customs, and the crew claimed that the ship would lose 3,000 taels per day of delay. If the problem was not resolved, the firearms would be thrown into the sea. The Wujin County government's representatives were also waiting in Shanghai because Changzhou had also ordered hundreds of rifles from the same foreign firm. It is now known that Lu and Wu have negotiated with the representatives from Changzhou and requested the ship to stay for 24 hours. The loss of 3,000 taels will be borne by this county and Wujin. At the same time, they entrusted the Songhu authorities to negotiate with Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance and asked Guo Di to rush to obtain the passport. All the firearms would be purchased by the Ministry of Finance. Although the deposit paid by this county can be refunded, the losses incurred in delaying the ship and in purchasing and selling the firearms are already substantial.</p>

<p>Exploiting the Labor Dispute Remains Difficult to Resolve: Exploiting the rice subsidy turmoil in the yarn factory led to a strike. Zhong Jianhui, a member of the county party headquarters, mediated and signed the conditions. The Public Security Bureau released the detained suspects, Shen Zhangbao and 15 others, and only detained the representatives Ren Ruisheng and Li Jinsheng, who would be released after work resumed. Yesterday morning, when the workers were about to go to work at the factory, the iron gate was tightly closed. Manager Wang Yiyun suddenly regretted his previous agreement, saying that the conditions had to be resolved by the board of directors because the factory's business had also been poor recently, resulting in heavy losses. The workers then returned home. Member Zhong contacted the factory again, but the company's attitude was firm. Member Zhong immediately telegraphed the provincial party headquarters for instructions. The labor dispute remains difficult to resolve. The Public Security Bureau has not released the detained representatives Ren Ruisheng and others.</p>

<p>Recent Financial Problems in the Education Sector: The education sector in Jiangdu has been facing difficulties for the past six months due to years of famine and frequent changes of directors, resulting in accumulated arrears of educational funds for four or five months. After the new director, Chen Lanfang, took office, he was deeply concerned about the extreme hardship of his colleagues in the education sector. As a first step, he devised various methods to raise funds. Since taking office on the 16th of this month, he had raised and distributed funds for one and a half months (totaling more than 27,000 yuan) by yesterday (30th), which has slightly stabilized morale. It is now heard that Director Chen plans to raise funds for another two months before the summer vacation. Whether or not he can fulfill this wish is still unknown.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Accused of Colluding with Bandits - Ordered to Investigate: Tao Xuezhong, the leader of the Xiannvmiao Chamber of Commerce team in the county, was accused of colluding with bandits and defecting to the North.

However, the local merchants believed that Chief Tao would never do such a thing. Guan Mengting, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, also issued a letter of guarantee and sent it to the team to reinstate its mandate. Therefore, the chief was spared the loss of freedom.</p>
<p>Reduction in Slaughter Tax for Bidding: The slaughter tax in Jiangdu County was increased, resulting in no one bidding.

<p>Cancellation of Custody of Two Pawnshop Redemption Funds: Although the labor dispute at the Changling Pawnshop had been resolved earlier, all the redemption funds had been placed under the custody of county government official Ling Han and deposited in the Dechun Huichang Yong Pawnshops. It is now known that after the pawnshop dispute was resolved, the custody of the redemption funds was canceled.

<p>Zhang Fuqing and Others File Charges Against Meng Enyuan: Meng Enyuan, the former military governor of Jilin, was charged with illegally occupying the Harbin Electric Light Company and selling it to the Jilin Yongheng Official Bank for 1.94 million yuan. At that time, various newspapers published articles stating that Meng had improper behavior. Citizens Liu Zhongshu and others jointly requested the provincial government to confiscate the Electric Light Company and return it to the public. Meng settled the matter with money. Shareholders Kong Xianzhang also filed charges with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government to investigate. It has now been learned that Zhang Fuqing, a third-party creditor, has joined the lawsuit and filed charges with the National Government against Meng for various illegal acts during his tenure.

<p>Provincial Order Exempts Hotel Registration Books from Stamp Tax: Hotels in Jiaxing are equipped with registration books for filling in information about guests. Penalties often occur because stamp duty is not paid. Recently, the Gaosheng Hotel in Dongmen was found by an investigator from the Stamp Tax Bureau to have failed to affix stamps to the guest registration book, which was deemed to be a violation of the stamp duty regulations. The book was taken to the bureau and transferred to the County Public Security Bureau for punishment. The hotel refused to accept the judgment and reported it to the Chengdong Commercial Association. After receiving the report, the association stated that the registration book only contained information such as the guest's age, appearance, origin, and destination for the Public Security Bureau's inspection. It was not related to trade accounts or commercial books, and it was doubtful that stamp duty should be required. It jointly telegraphed the Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau, requesting an explanation on behalf of the various commercial associations in Beidajie and Beimenwai. A telegram was received in reply, stating that the guest registration book specifically prepared by the hotel for the Public Security Bureau's inspection was not related to trade and should be exempt from stamp duty. After receiving the telegram, the association notified the County Public Security Bureau and the Jiaxing Stamp Tax Sub-Bureau yesterday.</p>

<p>Tragic Incident of Bandits Robbing a Prisoner: A tragic incident of bandits robbing a prisoner occurred in Gaobu, Shaoxing, on the night of the 30th. The details are as follows: The prisoner, named Qian Yichen, was being escorted from Hangzhou to Sheng County. The Shaoxing Public Security Bureau assigned patrol team soldiers Xie Guitang and Zhou Genyuan to take the late-night boat to Sheng from Haoba. When they approached Gaobu, it was already late at night. Two bandits suddenly jumped out inside the boat, each wielding a wooden-sheathed gun. They ordered Xie Guitang to release the prisoner. When he hesitated, the bandits opened fire. Xie Guitang was shot twice in the abdomen and once in the leg. He immediately fell to the ground in a pool of blood. The bandits then ordered the boatman to dock and instructed Zhou Genyuan to lead the way west. The boat carried the wounded soldier to Gaobu and reported it to the Public Security Branch Bureau. The news was relayed to the city by telephone. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent a team of soldiers to Gaobu to pursue the bandits. The wounded soldier was sent to the city for treatment overnight, but he died en route due to his serious injuries. The soldiers dispatched from the city encountered the bandits and the robbed prisoner on the narrow road in front of the bus station outside the Wuyun Gate. They ordered them to stop, but the bandits opened fire, wounding the team soldier Wang Jinsheng in the left foot. The two bandits and the prisoner fled north. When the Public Security Bureau subsequently sent an inspector along with various police chiefs and detectives to arrest them, the bandits had already fled far away.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, We read with astonishment the article titled "Libidinous Scoundrel Rapes Young Girl" in the Wuxi correspondence section of your newspaper on the 23rd of this month. Our establishments are located directly opposite and next to (Yongfengshun) Fruit Store. We did not witness any such rape incident occurring on that day. Moreover, the temple is the busiest commercial area in our city, with shops lining the streets and pedestrians constantly passing by throughout the night. Furthermore, our establishments were not yet closed at 9:00 PM. It is obvious to all that the store clerk, You Ruichang, could not have tricked and raped the girl. The details in your newspaper's article are likely based on mistaken rumors. As this matter concerns local customs and the reputation of the store, we, as close neighbors, feel compelled to write this letter on their behalf, even if it seems presumptuous. We hope that you will publish our letter to dispel any doubts. We are grateful. Yan Juezhi, Zhang Zheng, Li Shuping, Zhu Muzhou, Dai Shaohong, May 31.</p>

<p>Yesterday, I read with astonishment the article titled "Another Dispute at Dingfengyong Silk Factory" in the Zhenjiang News section of your newspaper. The leader of the reeler worker's small group at the former Qinyi Silk Factory, Xu Erniang, was not hired by our factory because of her poor skills when we began operations. When Xu was not hired, Wang Siso immediately declared that if Xu wasn't working, everyone would stop working together, instigating a strike. Fortunately, most of the workers did not follow her lead and continued to work. After mediation by the Zhenjiang County Workers' Restructuring Committee, it was requested that she be tried out, which has already been done. Since our factory began operations on May 26 of this year, no strike has occurred. The article in your newspaper is likely based on mistaken rumors. As this matter concerns labor unrest, it is inappropriate to allow it to cause confusion. I am writing this quick letter to correct the record. I hope that it will be published in the Incoming Letters section. I would be grateful. Sincerely, Zhang Shaoqin, Manager of Dingfengyong Silk Factory, 19, 5, 31.</p>

<p>Shigemitsu Aoi, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires in China, was previously summoned back to his country by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to consult on future steps in negotiations with China and the issue of Ambassador Obata's visit to China. The date of Mr. Shigemitsu's departure had been postponed repeatedly. It was later set for yesterday on the Chichibu Maru. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs suddenly instructed Shigemitsu to suspend his return to his country. Therefore, Shigemitsu was unable to leave yesterday. The Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai has kept the reason for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs' sudden instruction to Shigemitsu to suspend his return to his country a secret. Whether Shigemitsu will still return to Tokyo in the future is also uncertain. According to the general observation of the Japanese, it is believed that Shigemitsu's suspension of his return to his country is related to the political situation in China.</p>
<h3 id="e78">The Preparatory Committee for Commercial Consolidation Prepares to Convene a Delegates' Congress <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Formal Establishment of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for Commercial Consolidation, having resolved through a plenary committee meeting, has scheduled a city-wide delegates' congress for June 21st to formally establish the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, it submitted reports to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and applied for permission from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. The original text stated that the powers stipulated in Article 3 of the organizational outline of our committee are: (1) Registering members of the former Shanghai Merchants' Association, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Zhabei Chamber of Commerce, and Nanshi Chamber of Commerce; (2) Drafting regulations for a unified organization in accordance with laws and regulations; (3) Preparing all organizational procedures for a unified organization. Currently, the first item, the registration procedure, has already been completed. The second item, the regulations of the Shanghai Special City Chamber of Commerce, has also been drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval. We proceeded according to the amendments of the Bureau of Social Affairs and, following the 51st executive meeting of our committee, amended them in accordance with the approved instructions. As for the third item, among the registered merchant organizations, 138 trade associations have been reorganized under the guidance of our committee, and 23 trade associations have been merged under the guidance of our committee. Among these 138 trade associations, 20 have completed reorganization. However, according to Article 14 of the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations promulgated by the National Government on August 17, 1929, [existing industrial and commercial associations prior to the implementation of this law, regardless of whether they are called public offices, guilds, or other names, whose aims are in accordance with the provisions of this law, shall be regarded as industrial and commercial associations established in accordance with this law, and shall be reorganized in accordance with this law within one year after its implementation]. The mission undertaken by our committee is to guide the local merchant organizations in accordance with laws and regulations. The Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations clearly stipulates that the time limit for reorganization is one year. Although our committee urges the trade associations to actively reorganize in accordance with the law, the time limit for reorganization granted by the law cannot be changed. Furthermore, the Law on Industrial and Commercial Associations also clearly stipulates that all those whose aims are in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 of this law shall be regarded as industrial and commercial associations established in accordance with this law. Therefore, within the scope of this city, the 138 trade associations reorganized under the guidance of our committee, although some have not yet completed reorganization in fact, their legal status has been completely determined. Furthermore, Article 12 of our committee's organizational outline stipulates that the Shanghai Commercial Consolidation Committee shall apply the service rules of the various levels of mass organization consolidation committees passed by the 150th executive meeting of the Central Committee in June 1928. Article 7 of those rules stipulates that when more than one-third of the lower-level organizations under the jurisdiction of the Consolidation Committee of Mass Organizations of each special city or county-level city have completed consolidation, they should report to the Party Headquarters of each special city or county-level city to send people to inspect. If it is deemed that a delegates' congress of mass organizations of the entire province (special city) or county (city) can be convened, the delegates' congress of the entire province (special city) or county (city) may be convened immediately. Currently, there are a total of 161 trade associations in this city that have been reorganized and merged under the guidance of our committee in accordance with the law. Among these 161 trade associations, 138 trade associations have been legally determined to be able to exercise their functions, which greatly exceeds the one-third requirement. Now, in order to complete the task of [establishing the organization of a unified group] stipulated in Article 15 of our committee's organizational outline, all organizational procedures for preparing a unified group are being actively carried out, and convening a delegates' congress of trade associations is a particularly important procedure for preparing a unified group. After considering the situation, it is urgently necessary to stipulate a date and hold it as soon as possible. Therefore, at the 13th plenary meeting of our committee on the 22nd of this month, it was resolved to convene a delegates' congress of trade associations in this city on June 21st, and to state the reasons in advance and apply for permission from the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs. As for the remaining organizations that have been merged under the guidance of our committee in accordance with the law but have not yet been completed, it is proposed that the reorganization committee of the relevant trade organization exercise its powers on its behalf, and recommend delegates in accordance with the regulations to attend the meeting together. This is because the nature of the reorganization committee of each relevant organization is to exercise the former powers of each merged organization on behalf of it during the reorganization period, which is the same as our committee exercising the powers of the four former merchant organizations on behalf of it. Recommending delegates to attend the meeting is also within the scope of exercising powers on its behalf, and should not be restricted separately. All the reasons for requesting permission to convene a delegates' congress of trade associations in this city are hereby stated. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby request your review and filing for public convenience.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Postal Employees' Union quickly telegraphed (titles omitted)</p>
<p>Publicly Appraised, Our China Post, after more than thirty years of operation, relies on the strictness of regulations and the spirit of examination. Fortunately, in the dark environment, it has been able to cleanse the murky and eliminate the corrupt, and not be mixed with them. Unexpectedly, last month, the Postal Administration, outside of the personnel grades stipulated in the Postal Regulations approved and promulgated by the National Government, arbitrarily established the deformed system of assistant and document clerks, and without holding legal examinations, privately extended personal invitations to twelve people to serve as document clerks and three people to serve as assistants. The latter has a monthly salary of 500 yuan for one person and 350 yuan for two people, and there is a pre-determination to be appointed as deputy postmaster in two years. The former has a monthly salary starting at 160 yuan, increasing annually to 280 yuan. Upon close inspection of the resumes of the assistants, one once served as an engineer, one once served as a consul of a certain country, and only one once served as an attendant of the postal association. The members of the document clerks are even more complex. At most, they are ignorant of postal knowledge and perfunctory in their duties. Alas, the rewards that our postal service personnel cannot obtain after a lifetime of hard work, or after decades of service, are now safely enjoyed by these people in one fell swoop. What injustice is greater than this? In the long run, it will lead to bribery, and success will be achieved through bribery. The fortunate ones</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>will be prominent, and the meritorious ones will be demoralized. Is the future of the postal service still worth asking about? Our Zeng and others, considering the difficulty of establishing the postal service, thoroughly oppose this system of document clerks and assistants that violates the teachings of the Premier and destroys the postal system. If there is a need for document and assistant affairs, the usual practice can be followed, and experienced personnel can be selected from among the senior staff to serve in order to be skilled. If this is not sufficient, legal examinations can be held in accordance with the regulations, and they can be assigned separately according to their existing grades. As for the twelve document clerks and assistants who have already been employed, since there is no basis in the postal regulations and they have not undergone legal examinations, their positions should be terminated. This opinion has already been submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the various ministries and departments of the National Government, and the newly appointed Postmaster General Wei Yifu for verification. The entire staff of our association is panicked. For the sake of the Party, for the sake of the postal service, and for the sake of our 400 million compatriots, we dare not be lenient. We sincerely hope that compatriots from all walks of life will understand that the selfishness of a few people will result in harm to the development of the postal service, and may even affect the overall political situation. We must unite and fight together to support them. Then the central government and the officials of the national government, with their clear vision, will surely find a solution through revolutionary means, so that the postal system will be complete, corruption will disappear, and then the bright and brilliant postal service can be realized. We earnestly and painfully plead, and humbly request your consideration.</p>
<h3 id="e86">The Pharmacy Workers' Union's Refutation of the Commercial Consolidation Committee <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Pharmacy Workers' Union sent a letter to the Commercial Consolidation Committee, stating: "Dear Sirs, yesterday I read in the newspaper that your committee presented the original news of the National Government of the Central Party Headquarters applying for the protection of human rights, stating briefly that, according to the clear orders of the National Government, the freedom of the bodies of all legitimate merchants and law-abiding residents should not be infringed by others without legal procedures, etc. The trade association fabricated facts, used dangerous words to incite listeners, and wove accusations, which shows the insidiousness of the association's intentions and the viciousness of its methods. Your committee, however, does not distinguish between right and wrong, listens to one-sided words, arbitrarily makes judgments, and disregards the facts, which is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, the Party and government authorities are well aware of the whole story, otherwise the colleagues of our association would have been caught in the net. This kind of slanderous propaganda is self-defeating to those who know the truth, and there is no value in making a statement. However, I am sincerely afraid that the outside world will not understand the truth and be deceived by it, so I have to write to your committee to clarify one or two things in order to clarify right and wrong and to promote justice. (1) Does the so-called protection of human rights by the association only refer to merchants, or should all the people of the country enjoy it? If it is as the association says, then I would like to investigate that on the afternoon of March 24, Hu Qingyu Tang capital (committee member of the trade association) at 7:00 PM, the Municipal Training Association representative Lin Meiyan, our association representative Zhao Zhenhui, accepted the request of the workers of the store, went to attend guidance, was falsely accused by the capital of being a communist, instigated armed patrolmen, abused their power, detained people in the police station, and expelled and beat the workers, etc. Our association is far away in Nanshi and similar facts occur from time to time. Why do you turn a deaf ear to it? Your association is close at hand, and you are deeply aware of the fact that it relies on the power of imperialism to oppress the workers. Why do you remain silent and have not heard of any expression? This is truly a great mystery to our association and awaits your explanation. As for Feng Jinpu's arrest, there is already a reply from the Municipal Training Association, so there is no need to repeat it. If it is said that the case of Song Zhuan Chen is even more unrelated to our association. If Mr. Song comes to the meeting on his own, how can our association refuse him? As for the workers' coercion, it is even more absurd. Workers demand wages, and coercion is not allowed in the present era, and it is not even close to reason. It is clear that the association intends to design harm and instructs Mr. Song to use this ghostly tactic. This is what our association should urgently declare and expose the secrets of the association. The motivation for our association to place workers has been published in the newspapers, based on conditions, referring to business realities, and seeking social security. The association has spread rumors of forced placement and requested the protection of human rights. We do not know whether the so-called forced placement is established (the previous report to the municipal party government and the letter to the petitioners have refuted it). The boundaries of the so-called human rights are purely selfish subjective observations, and all other measures are illegal. If unfortunately my words are true, then what is there to say? Your committee's position and talent are many times higher than our association's. Dare I ask you to teach me clearly? I am extremely eager to see your guidance."</p>
<h3 id="e87">Guo Qingzhao Passed Away on May 30th <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Funeral Will Be Held at 10:00 AM Today</p>
<p>Guo Qingzhao, a member of the Kuomintang, was resented by the communists for his efforts to purify the party. On May 5, 1930, he was attacked by communist thugs on Beile Road in the French Concession, shot in the waist and spine, and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. However, because the spinal nerve system was severed by the bullet, the upper part of his body could eat, speak, and move normally after recovery, but the lower part of his body lost sensation, resulting in disability. In May of this year, he was admitted to the Fumin Hospital established by the Japanese on North Sichuan Road to undergo surgery to reconnect the nerve system. He underwent surgery at 3:00 PM on the 5/30 Memorial Day, and due to excessive bleeding, he passed away at 8:00 PM that night. The following is a brief account of Mr. Guo's life and circumstances:</p>
<p>A Brief Account of Mr. Guo's Life Mr. Guo, 25 years old, a native of Ninghai, Zhejiang Province, was a top student at Zhejiang Provincial Fourth Middle School. He worked in the manufacturing department of the Shanghai Commercial Press as a typesetter. In 1925, he witnessed the May 30th Massacre and was angered by the brutality of the imperialists. To seek a proper way out for the workers, he resolutely joined the Chinese Kuomintang as a member, firmly believing in the Three People's Principles and studying them in depth. He was fierce, ambitious, and courageous. In his spare time, he still went to Shanggong Youth Lizhi Association night school for supplementary education. He then secretly discovered that the communists had a plot to overthrow the Chinese Kuomintang, so he secretly formed loyal comrades to fight for the party. Then, in April 1927, he implemented the purification of the party. Mr. Guo was then the standing committee member of the 14th branch of the First District, so he took the lead in launching the movement, and all the communists who were hiding in the factory of the Commercial Press were cleared out. Therefore, he was deeply trusted by the Central Committee and served as a standing committee member of the Commercial Press Labor Union, the Minister of Agriculture and Labor of the First District Party Headquarters, the instructor of the Shanghai Labor Union Unity Committee, the Standing Committee Member and Minister of Organization of the Shanghai General Labor Union, and the Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai Labor Union Consolidation Committee. He became more and more diligent in suppressing the communists and leading the labor movement. Although he went through many hardships, he became more and more enthusiastic in his struggle. Therefore, the Communist Party hated him to the bone, and Guo knew this, but he did not care. Suddenly, on the May 5th Memorial Day in 1928, he was ambushed by thugs on Beile Road in the French Concession while on official business, shot in the waist and spine, and sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Fortunately, he survived, but the spinal nerve system was severed by the bullet, and the lower body lost all sensation, resulting in disability. The Central Committee approved an annual pension of 400 yuan. After becoming disabled, Guo could not get up and walk, but he could still sit and plan. He still worked hard for the party as before and did not flinch. Therefore, the six district party headquarters in this city repeatedly elected Guo as a supervisory committee member. His belief among comrades can be seen from this. After becoming disabled, Guo deeply felt the difficulties of the times and the national crisis for two years, which was deafening and heartbreaking. He often hated his body for being a burden and consuming the pension. Recently, he heard that the Fumin Hospital established by the Japanese on North Sichuan Road could reconnect the nerve system by surgery, so he resolutely entered the hospital. Comrades and relatives all advised him to stop, because the matter was extremely dangerous, and even the doctors were not sure. Guo did not listen and said that if he could be healthy, his youth could still make a second contribution to the party. Even if he died, it would be better than worrying about old age in bed. He only hoped that all comrades would work hard for the party, and he would have no regrets if he died. The comrades were deeply saddened by his words and the uncertainty of the matter, and accompanied him to the hospital. At 3:00 PM on the 5/30 Memorial Day, the reconnection procedure was performed, and it was completed at 5:00 PM. The sensation in the lower body was restored. Everyone in the hospital was overjoyed. Because Guo had been disabled and economically distressed, his physical condition was weakening. This time, he lost too much blood and collapsed, and he could not be revived until 8:00 PM that night. He had already followed the martyrs. He was injured on the May 5th Memorial Day in 1928 and died on the May 30th Memorial Day in 1930, after two years and twenty-five days. Mr. Guo's death will follow these two anniversaries forever, which can be said to be a fortunate misfortune.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo's family members include his maternal grandmother, who is now 96 years old, his biological mother, who is now 63 years old, his wife, Ms. Ding, who is now 22 years old, and a son named Yongchou (meaning to eternally remember the communists' murder of his father), who is only 4 years old. They were all supported by Mr. Guo.</p>
<p>Posthumous arrangements After Mr. Guo's death, his family was destitute and the responsibility of supporting the elderly and raising children was very heavy. The comrades will organize a funeral committee, report to the municipal party headquarters and request for funeral expenses, and forward it to the central government for a more favorable discussion of the annual pension, which will continue to be received by Guo's son Yongchou in accordance with the regulations. The municipal party headquarters has approved a funeral expense of 500 yuan to handle the funeral affairs first.</p>
<p>Funeral route Mr. Guo's funeral residence is located in Chongye Lane, Yuezhou Road. The funeral will be held at 10:00 AM today (2nd), passing through Yuezhou Road, Zhaofeng Road, Oujia Road, Disiwei Road, North Sichuan Road, Dule'an Road, Donghengbang Road, Baoshan Road, Henan Road, directly to Minguo Road, and walking west to Fangxie Road to the Xieqiao temporary residence in Taizhou Guild Hall.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Strike at Edison Factory Reported Yesterday <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The General Electric Edison Appliance Company issued a notice, limiting those employed to work as usual from 7:00 AM on Monday (i.e., today), otherwise it will be regarded as resignation. Those who later request to work will be considered new workers, and various bonuses will be cancelled, etc. Upon hearing this, the strike committee of the factory specially issued a notice to the workers yesterday, stating: "Workers, do not be fooled by the capitalists. We must fight for ourselves. Obey all government and labor union orders and wait patiently for a solution."</p>
<h3 id="e89">Seamen's Union Requests No Japanese Examiners for Seamen <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The China Seamen's Industrial Federation yesterday received a report from the Qingdao branch, requesting the National Government's Ministry of Finance to order the Qingdao Customs not to use Japanese people as members of the seamen's examination committee. The original report is as follows: "We respectfully believe that the seamen's examination was originally intended to test skills and ensure safe navigation, so that both industry and life are safe. The law is the best and the intention is the best. However, although Qingdao has been taken over by our country, the Japanese are still invading it as if it were a sphere of influence. Therefore, the Qingdao Customs also uses Japanese people as members of the seamen's examination committee, which is shameful and humiliating. The people of the island have many complaints. Therefore, we should write a letter and request the Ministry of Finance to order the Qingdao Customs not to appoint Japanese people as members of the seamen's examination committee in the future in order to maintain national rights and avoid public opinion. This is a public convenience, etc. It is verified that Qingdao is a territory returned by our country, and the Chinese are not without nautical knowledge and experience. There is no need to borrow talent from other places, which would lead to the loss of national prestige and sovereignty. According to the previous report, we should prepare a letter and forward it to your department, sincerely requesting that you investigate and order the Qingdao Customs to remove all Japanese members of the seamen's examination committee and never employ them in the future. What to do is still waiting for your approval."</p>
<h3 id="e90">Official Letter Regarding the Rectification of Silk Cocoon Tax Collection <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>To Mr. Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance: In order to safeguard and rectify the silk cocoon industry, I have specially appointed Wu Longyue as the special financial commissioner of Jiangsu Province. An office has been established in Shanghai. Yesterday, Mr. Wu sent a letter to the Silk Cocoon Industry Association, which reads as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the silk cocoon taxes, which are a major source of national revenue, over the years, various bureaus have largely failed to strictly implement the regulations and procedures, leading to various malpractices. Dishonest officials and clerks have taken advantage of their positions for personal gain, creating difficulties and making demands. Some have even colluded with merchants to underreport or evade taxes, or use the same invoice multiple times. Such situations are inevitable.</p>
<p>In the case of cunning merchants who seek to benefit themselves and are willing to collude in wrongdoing, genuine and law-abiding merchants are subjected to undue harassment and hardship. Therefore, for the collection of cocoon taxes this year, the original regulations have been revised by this office, and all bureaus are ordered to comply with them, vigorously eliminate long-standing malpractices, and strictly prohibit demands for fees or customary charges associated with tax invoices, in order to achieve rectification.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this office has appointed commissioners to be stationed in Shanghai and Wuxi, the two areas where silk cocoons are most concentrated, to conduct investigations and inspections. With this approach, on the one hand, tax collection is being rectified to prevent fraud and confusion; on the other hand, honest merchants are being protected to facilitate their business operations and alleviate their burdens.</p>
<p>For fear that this is not yet widely known, this letter is being sent to inform all merchants and manufacturers that henceforth, when transporting silk cocoons, after paying the taxes at the point of origin, and passing through the inspection of various authorities, as long as the invoices and goods match and the procedures are complete, verification and stamping will be promptly provided for release. If there is any obstruction or demand for fees, they are permitted to report to this office at any time. Once verified, the relevant officials and clerks will be severely punished to deter greed.</p>
<p>Merchants and manufacturers must also not continue to engage in old malpractices, privately providing customary fees, or colluding in wrongdoing, lest they be held jointly liable. In addition to sending personnel to various locations for secret investigations, you are hereby ordered to comply without fail. Sincerely,</p>

<p>With the conclusion of the cocoon market in various areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, silk mills in Shanghai are now reeling new cocoons. An investigation reveals that of the 106 silk mills in Shanghai, only 60% are scheduled to start operations today (the 2nd). The remainder are waiting for the arrival of new cocoons in Shanghai before commencing operations.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Important Officials of the Bureau of Commodity Inspection Appointed by the Ministry <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Minister of Industry and Commerce, Kong, has always been cautious in selecting personnel for various agencies under his jurisdiction. They must undergo a three-month trial period. Only after assessing their performance and confirming their competence are they formally appointed. The Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection was established over a year ago. After carefully screening and assigning various officials on a trial basis, the trial period has been at least three months, and for some, over a year. Assessments have shown that they are diligent in their duties and fulfilling their responsibilities.</p>
<p>The bureau has previously submitted a list of officials who have completed their trial periods, along with their performance records, to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review. The Ministry has approved the granting of official appointments. The following are the important officials:</p>
<p>Secretary Zhang Qiwen (Chinese), Huang Zongzhu (Western languages), Head of the General Affairs Department Li Wen, Head of the Raw Silk Inspection Department Miao Zhongxiu, Deputy Head Li An, Technician Lan En, Head of the Cotton Inspection Department Ye Yuanding, Deputy Head Cheng Youfu, Head of the Livestock and By-product Inspection Department Chen Shunyun, Veterinarians Yi Wenzhi and Luo Qingsheng, Head of the Chemical Inspection Department Zhang Weiru. The acting head of the Lace Inspection Department, Chen Jinduan, Deputy Head Tao Yumen, Raw Silk Inspection Department technicians Guo Limao and Sun Benzhong, and the Head of the Livestock and By-product Inspection Department Huang Yisheng, and technician Gibbs are still within their trial periods and will be submitted for approval for official appointment later.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Fight Among Chauffeurs <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Caused by Professional Jealousy</p>
<p>Firefighter Helps Fellow Chauffeur</p>
<p>At around 3:00 AM yesterday, a brawl among industry workers occurred at the Xingfa Automobile Company at the intersection of Deswei Road and Tiantong Road. Chauffeur Wei Rongsheng, as well as Yin Maomao, a leader of the Hongkou Fire Brigade, and coppersmith Zhou Zhongsheng were all seriously injured. Fortunately, the First Precinct of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau learned of the incident and dispatched police to arrest all those involved.</p>
<p>The incident stemmed from professional jealousy, the result of a business dispute between the Xingfa and Zhongmei Automobile Companies. The Zhongmei Automobile Company, located at 33 Wusong Road, has been doing fairly well. Especially during horse and dog racing season, it is overwhelmed with business. However, automobiles from other companies, such as Xingfa, have often been found at its door, soliciting customers. On the customer's side, they board any car they see and do not inquire as to whose car it is. However, the owner of Zhongmei feels unhappy about others sharing in his profits, believing that a porridge shop in front of a restaurant is nothing but stealing business. Furthermore, they considered that others were hindering the entry and exit of vehicles and obstructing pedestrian traffic. They frequently used harsh words and sarcasm to order others to leave, but with no result. Instead, the two sides exchanged unpleasant words.</p>
<p>On the day before yesterday, during the Jiangwan horse racing season, both the Zhongmei and Xingfa Automobile Companies sent cars to Jiangwan Road to pick up and drop off customers. Zhongmei chauffeur Geng Longren and Xingfa chauffeur Li Sanxi started a quarrel over competing for passengers, which led to fighting. The situation was very fierce. However, afterwards, they dispersed.</p>
<p>However, at 3:00 AM yesterday, Geng Longren of Zhongmei suddenly led a group of people to argue. Because the two sides had long-standing grudges, the situation quickly escalated. A major brawl broke out. The question of who was right or wrong was irrelevant. Instantly, iron rulers were flying and knives were flashing. Loud shouts were heard by the neighbors. As a result, Wei Rongsheng of the Xingfa Company, Yin Maomao of the Hongkou Fire Brigade, and Zhou Zhongsheng were injured in the head, face, chest, and waist. Several others sustained minor injuries.</p>
<p>The First Precinct of the Fifth District Public Security Bureau learned of the incident and immediately dispatched police to arrest the perpetrators. They were Li Sanxi, Yan Yonggui, Wei Rongsheng, and the defendants Geng Longren, Yin Maomao, Zhou Zhongsheng, Ding Dechang, Zhou Shiyuan, and Shi Yongqing. Of these, Yin, Zhou, and Shi were all employed by the Shenjiawan Fire Brigade and had been invited by the Zhongmei side.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Pujiang Robbery Reported Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>On the 30th of last month, the Junpu General Bureau dispatched several Chinese and foreign staff members, including Ou An, Hart, Sun Duoting, and Chen Wangshan, on the "Lifei" launch to distribute salaries to workers on various dredging vessels working in the Pujiang River. As it sailed to the Haixie machine ship near the Huangpu Wharf in Pudong, it was suddenly attacked by seven or eight bandits who jumped onto the launch and fired over 30 shots, stealing over 20,000 yuan in cash. They also shot and killed one Chinese and one foreign engineer, and seriously injured four others. This was reported in yesterday's news. Further details obtained yesterday are listed below:</p>

<p>The staff of the Junpu Bureau's various machine ships were in urgent need of wages for the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival. As such, the bureau has decided at a meeting to re-issue the wages to the various machine ships on Monday (the 2nd). To prevent such incidents, the bureau has requested the Special Municipality Public Security Bureau to dispatch eight armed police officers for protection.</p>

<p>Sun Duoting, Chinese Deputy Engineer of the Junpu Bureau's dredging department, died in the line of duty. The bureau convened an emergency meeting on the 30th of last month. The standard compensation for Sun was only two years' salary, about 10,000 yuan. Because the incident was extraordinary, more generous compensation should be provided. After discussions by the bureau chiefs, it was proposed that Sun Duoting's special compensation be 20,000 taels of silver.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Former Haizhou Transportation Official Blackmailed by Subordinates <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Allegations of Private Gain and Corruption</p>
<p>$400 Ransom Demanded</p>
<p>Evidence Returned</p>
<p>Two Arrested On Site</p>
<p>Zhang Tianji, a native of Nanhai County, Guangdong Province, served as the Haizhou Transportation Official. His brother, Zean (An Qinsheng), also served as a section chief in the Transportation Official's office. Last year, Tianji left his post, and the brothers brought their families to Shanghai, residing on Beinan Road. Zean then joined the Zhihua Hospital on Wenzhou Road.</p>
<p>On March 26th of this year, Zean received a letter to be forwarded to Tianji. After reading it, it stated that Tianji had engaged in private gain and corruption while in office. Written evidence had been obtained and would be reported to a superior official, unless 400 yuan was paid as a "birthday gift", after which the evidence would be returned. The letter was signed Zheng Fuyu. Tianji knew that Zheng was the document section chief of the Transportation Official's office, so he ignored what appeared to be blackmail. Zheng then visited Tianji's residence to discuss the matter, but with no result.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Zhang asked his friend Dong Peizhi to rent room 77 at the Hongkou Hotel on North Sichuan Road and invited Zheng to negotiate there. Meanwhile, Zhang sent Zheng's letter to the Municipal Police Headquarters, accusing Zheng of extortion. A detective chief dispatched detectives Zhu Asan and Bao Tang Yao Changmin to wait at the hotel at 9:00 PM. Later, Zheng and his friend Lu Yuquan arrived at the Hongkou Hotel to negotiate with Dong. Dong gave them 400 yuan in marked bills, and Zheng and Lu returned the written evidence. As they left, the detectives pursued and arrested them. The 400 yuan they had extorted had already been split, with Zheng receiving 300 yuan and Lu receiving 100 yuan. Both amounts were found on their persons.</p>
<p>The next morning, they were taken to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu questioned them. The plaintiffs, Zhang Tianji and his brother, and the witness Dong Peizhi, testified to the events. Zheng, a native of Shaoxing, stated that he had previously served as Zhang Tianji's document section chief. More than 1,000 yuan in rewards for anti-smuggling confiscated by the Transportation Official's office were embezzled by Zhang when he left his post. He claimed he was entitled to 300 yuan of these rewards, so he asked for it. As for the various acts of corruption during Zhang's tenure, he had listed the evidence and reported it to the Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance, not extorting him. Lu, a native of Fujian, claimed that he had been trying to resolve the dispute between Zhang and Zheng and that Dong had given him 100 yuan as a reward, which he had refused. The court ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody for a further hearing.</p>

<p>Realized His Error Only At Death's Door</p>
<p>Admonishing Others Not To Go Astray</p>
<p>A suicide note filled with self-pity</p>
<p>Yesterday at noon, a young man in his twenties, Cheng Puru from Jiading, boarded a ferry at the Ning-Shao Wharf on the Bund to cross the river to Pudong. As the ferry reached mid-stream, Cheng suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. The boatman immediately stopped the engine and tried to rescue him, and the sailors also helped to retrieve Cheng. He was unconscious from swallowing too much water. The boatman steered the boat to Pudong, where the patrolman brought Cheng to the Third District Public Security Bureau. They revived him using artificial respiration.</p>
<p>He confessed that he had been working in the foreign goods business, but</p>

<h3 id="e108">Opinion On "Egg Inside an Egg" <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Related To The Chicken's Constitution</p>
<p>Not A Different Internal Structure</p>
<p>Two hens raised at the Chen Longxing rice store on Sanguantang Street in Tangqiao, Pudong, have laid a total of three "egg-in-egg" eggs, varying in shape and length. Nearby residents have expressed their surprise. This newspaper reported the matter on the 29th of last month. Yesterday, we met Mr. Chen Peide, a former senior executive at an egg factory, who has considerable experience in egg research. We now record his opinion on "egg-in-egg", for the reference of the physiology community.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen said, this is not surprising. The laying of eggs by chickens varies with the constitution. So, there is often a double yolk egg, or an egg with white but no yolk, or a soft egg, etc. Ordinary people see this as strange, but in fact, double yolk eggs are due to the chicken's strong body and excessive essence. Eggs with white but no yolk, and soft eggs, are due to the chicken's weak constitution and incomplete development. "Egg-in-egg" is also due to the hen's excessive appetite, resulting in too much internal lime and essence, and the eggshell being overly fertilized. However, "egg-in-egg" often occurs within the egg yolk cell, and more often in the spring, but cannot be hatched. The chickens at the shop eat rice all day long, so their constitution is strong and their appetite is huge, which can explain the occurence. The eggshell is hard, which can prove that the hen is producing a lot, and it's not that the chicken has a different internal structure. If the chicken is fed less, then "egg-in-egg" will not occur again. It is also said that this kind of "egg-in-egg" can cure blocked digestion, but it remains to be verified.</p>

<p>Wang Chengbao Disregards Prohibition</p>
<p>Luo Sanlong Scams Under A False Identity</p>
<p>According to the old custom, every year during the Dragon Boat Festival, the residents along the river will have dragon boat races, but these old customs were mostly started by unemployed people who were only drumming up support as an excuse to collect money. There were even incidents of drowning during the flag snatching competitions. The government had issued strict prohibitions many times, but those people disobeyed. Yesterday was the Dragon Boat Festival, those people petitioned the Public Security Bureau last month to hold it, but the Fifth District Party Branch did not agree and it was still banned.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau ordered the Water Patrol Team to strictly prohibit it and issued a notice. However, at around 7:00 AM yesterday, numerous dragon boats were found at Puyi Ferry and Yangjia Ferry. Captain Xu of the Water Patrol Team dispatched patrol leader Li Chenghua with several police officers to arrest five. After a thorough investigation, Wang Chengbao, the organizer, claimed that the dragon boat race was being done by the people, but after the Public Security Bureau ordered the race to be stopped, Luo Sanlong approached him on May 24, claiming that he could contact the police for 400 yuan to allow the race. Wang agreed and paid 190 yuan on the spot, another 75 yuan was paid on May 30.</p>
<p>Wang said he had paid 265 yuan to Luo, and the money was given to Luo at the Deyi Teahouse in the City God Temple. They realized they were defrauded by Luo now that they were arrested. Captain Xu said that dragon boats do not fit with the nation and they were banned by the Public Security Bureau, and now he realized that they were guilty. He realized that Luo Sanlong dared to impersonate the authorities in order to scam money, which was even more heinous. Other than ordering his men to arrest Luo Sanlong, he sent Wang Chengbao to the judicial branch for approval.</p>

<p>One Child Drowned</p>
<p>More than 3000 Yuan In Losses</p>
<p>On the morning of May 31, the Xiechangde rice shop in Shanghai North District hired Jia Qiaonan's lighter to transport 210 bags of Saigon rice from the Tongchunfu warehouse in Pudong. At 11:55 AM, while passing through the Huangpu River off the Bund of Nanjing Road, it was struck by the "Kanda Maru" of the Japanese Yamashita Steamship Company. At the same time, the lighter was hooked by an iron hook on the ship. The ship did not stop, but dragged it for 4-5 li. The ship broke, and all the rice fell into the river. The ten people on board cried out. The steamer ignored them. One of the boatman's sons drowned. One of the coolies swam ashore, and the other eight were rescued by the ship's rope ladder. The Jianghai Customs Water Patrol and the Municipal Public Security Bureau Water Patrol witnessed the incident, but due to the speed of the ship, rescue was impossible. Afterwards, the Water Patrol supervised the salvage and retrieved 21 bags of wet rice. The total loss was more than 3,600 yuan. The Bean and Rice Industry Association North Office has sent a serious letter to the Yamashita Company to negotiate.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Illegal Behavior of Defendant's Lawyer in Extortion Case <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Statement of the police barrister</p>
<p>Stated two illegal acts</p>
<p>Zhou Dingwen, owner of the Zhou Dingji lacquer shop on Gansu Road, was extorted by a letter from bandits. The police arrested Wang Mingfu and Wang Desheng, and their confessions were reported in the newspapers. Judge Sun of the Special District Local Court continued the hearing on the case the other day. Wang Yaotang, the police barrister, suddenly mentioned the illegal behavior of the defendant's lawyer, Da Yaoxian.</p>
<p>The defense lawyer for a defendant in a criminal case should obtain permission from the police barrister or the police chief or the Western investigator in charge of the case before contacting his client in detention. However, lawyer Da entered the detention center without going through the above procedures. When questioned by the Chinese police, he falsely claimed to have obtained permission. This is one illegal act. After his client signed the statement, Lawyer Da instructed him not to confess anything during the court hearing.</p>
<p>The Chinese police heard this, this is the second illegal act. He specially made a solemn statement and requested the court to investigate it. Lawyer Da also immediately defended himself and denied any illegal behavior. Judge Sun ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody for another hearing in seven days. Regarding the part of concealing criminals, it will be sent to the prosecutor for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Zhuang Jian'an Responds To Dispute With Yicheng Steamship Company <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Denies Fraudulent Behavior</p>
<p>Wang Hancai Was In Fact A Partner</p>
<p>Zhuang Jian'an, the brother of Zhuang Dezhi, chairman of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, organized the Yicheng Steamship Company last year and rented the Hanping steamship. He hired a comprador, which was filled by Zhuang Zhongcai. Wang Hancai was the deputy comprador. The security deposit of 2,000 yuan should have been attached to the comprador's security deposit. Zhuang guaranteed it. Afterwards, it did not happen. Wang asked for the return of the security deposit. Wang hired a lawyer to accuse Zhuang of fraudulently obtaining money. The Special District Local Court heard the case. Zhuang Jian'an denied the fraud. Shen Yuesheng was hired to submit a statement, stating that the defendant wanted to introduce Zhuang Zhongcai to be the comprador, the stated comprador security deposit was 5,000 yuan, and the fee was 2,000 yuan. The plaintiff Wang Hancai volunteered to be the deputy comprador under Zhuang Zhongcai.</p>
<p>Zhuang transferred 2,000 yuan to the Yicheng Company. There was a small contract that each held. Later, Yicheng decided to rent the Hanping steamship back to Yicheng due to the unstable situation. The Shanghai-Yangzhou route was opened. Wang introduced Zhuang Ruozhou to join. Wang introduced Zhuang Ruozhou to join the shareholders of the Hanping Steamship Bureau. The money was transferred to the rental of the ship. Wang also signed. Afterwards, the capital of the wheel bureau was insufficient. The defendant borrowed 2,000 yuan from Jiang Nanheng for application. Therefore, the defendant was brought into the shareholder list of the Wheel Bureau.</p>
<p>At the beginning of December, it was publicly agreed to hire Jiang Nanheng as the manager of the Wheel Bureau and as the chief representative. The shareholders on the letter of engagement were the defendant, Zhuang Zhongcai, Zhuang Ruozhou, and Wang Hancai. The lawyer certified it. Later, the Hanping Wheel Bureau's business declined. The capital was depleted. The debts were heavy. Yicheng had insufficient rent. The ship was taken back at the end of April. The Wheel Bureau went out of business. The defendant asked the lawyer to gather everyone, but Zhuang Zhongcai and Zhuang Ruozhou were absent. Wang Hancai claimed to not be a shareholder. The defendant filed a lawsuit and was accused of fraud. The evidence showed that Wang had signed his name on the letter of engagement. If there was any kind of fraud, the shareholder would have a joint behavior. The facts are not true. As for Wang, he paid 2,000 yuan which had become the company's rent, then the responsibility had been fulfilled.</p>
<p>It is obvious that the claims are false. Therefore, the defendant is not guilty of fraud. The defendant filed a civil suit. Please dismiss the accusation. The hearing was scheduled to continue on the day before yesterday, but due to the time, Judge Feng adjourned the case for another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Adding the Cause of Death to Coffin Transport Guarantees <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau approved an official letter from the Health Bureau, referring to an order from the Ministry of Health and a request from the Guangdong Special Municipality Government to ban coffin transport. It directed that when issuing coffin transport permits, attention should be paid to the cause of death of the deceased. If the deceased died of an epidemic disease, the Regulations on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases should be followed. The letter was recorded and communicated for investigation. After approving the letter, Director Yuan stated that coffin transport for reburial mostly involves people of non-local origin. They often place the deceased in temporary sheds after death, and by the time they are transported back to their hometown for burial, the bodies have often already decomposed. If attention is only paid to the cause of death when applying for permits, it would be too late and would not fully align with the original intention of epidemic prevention. According to Articles 13 and 14 of the Regulations on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases, the bodies of those who died of epidemic diseases must be disinfected, placed in coffins within 24 hours, and buried in a location more than three *li* away from the city center, at a depth of more than seven *chi*. Therefore, attention should be paid to investigating the cause of death when reporting the death. If there are any doubts, the relevant district office should notify the Health Bureau at any time to dispatch personnel for joint handling. However, the inspection time should be within 24 hours after death, as corpses that have been exposed for too long are prone to spreading infection, and identification would also be greatly affected. In addition to adding the cause of death to the current coffin transport guarantee form and ordering all district offices to supervise household registration police to handle it diligently, a reply was sent to the Health Bureau yesterday for their information.</p>

<p>Ex-wife Hires Lawyer to Sue for Recovery</p>
<p>The woman Shi Shen, also known as Shen Xiaomei, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the court, accusing her husband Shi Zijian of abandonment and requesting a divorce and the recovery of alimony. After being summoned, the court granted the divorce and ordered the defendant to pay Shen alimony. The defendant refused to accept the judgment and filed an appeal. After the appeal court heard the case, the Chinese and Western officials approved the petition, summoned both parties for a retrial, and ordered that the initial judgment be enforced, ordering Shi Zijian to pay Shen Xiaomei 3,000 yuan in alimony. However, after the judgment, Shi has resisted and refused to comply. The lawyer representing Shen filed a case the day before yesterday, requesting prompt enforcement, stating that Shen and her daughter are now in extreme poverty and rely on this money to survive. They requested that the defendant be brought to court and severely punished to deter cunning behavior. Judge Zhu approved the order to summon the defendant to court for enforcement.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Brawl in a Teahouse on Hongqiao Road <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Seeking a Tea Brewing Dispute, Gathering Crowds for a Brawl</p>
<p>Multiple Injuries, Lives in Danger</p>
<p>Gao Ali, a 33-year-old from Yancheng, opened the Fuxing Teahouse in a bungalow without a number (the house number was demolished by the British Municipal Council last year when they overstepped their boundaries) on the west side of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway on Hongqiao Road, West Shanghai. Recently, business has been slow, so he hired blind storytellers in the evening to maintain business. On the evening before last (the 31st), at approximately 9:40 PM, Lü Shengfu, the brother-in-law of Deng Genhua, a man from Jintan who runs the Tongxing Mantou Shop next door, came to listen to the storytelling. Gao immediately went forward to greet him and arrange a seat. However, Lü did not want to brew tea, which led to a dispute. Deng heard about it and gathered workers from a nearby laundry shop, armed with iron pipes, to reason with Gao. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Gao also sought assistance from the Eastern Province Milk Shed. Neither side would back down, and the scene became chaotic, with loud noises and teapots and tables being smashed. As a result, six people were injured, including Deng's brother-in-law, Fu Honglai, a 22-year-old from Jintan, who was seriously injured; Deng's wife, Ms. Fu, who suffered minor arm injuries; Gao Ali's brother, Gao Ruhong, 40 years old, seriously injured; Gao's nephew, Gao Wenxiu, 18 years old, seriously injured, revived after appearing to be dead; a teahouse customer, Zhang Chenggen, 36 years old from Changzhou, suffered head injuries; and Fang Kaoshan, 42 years old from Changzhou, suffered injuries to his head and arms. After the patrol officer Zhang Xiangrui of the local police station heard the alarm, he immediately dispatched police officers to the scene and brought Gao Ali, Deng Genhua, Deng's wife Ms. Fu, and Lü Shengfu back to the station. The others fled. Fu Honglai, Gao Ruhong, and Gao Wenxiu, who were seriously injured, were taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. Due to internal injuries, their lives may not be saved. Director Xu, considering the case involved a brawl, submitted a document to the local court yesterday morning for investigation.</p>

<p>The evening before last at approximately 9:00 PM, a middle-aged man with a sorrowful expression was seen pacing back and forth along the Suzhou Creek in Zhabei for a long time. Ren Kuochen, the guard officer of the 27th post in the Fourth District, suspected his behavior and followed him closely. After a while, the man jumped into the river and drifted away. The guard officer was extremely alarmed and called for the help of local boatmen to rescue him. He was successfully saved and taken to the police station. He confessed that his name was Wang Yongbiao, from Shaoxing, 40 years old, a carpenter living at No. 43 Chongde Lane, Xinmin Road. He had been married to his wife, Ms. Zhong, for five years, and initially they were happy. However, recently she had become restless and had an affair with someone. He had repeatedly warned her, but she did not change. He had lost all face, and knowing that he was unable to control her, he could not bear his wife engaging in such shameless behavior. He was filled with anger and jumped into the river to kill himself. The police chief immediately ordered the police to summon Ms. Zhong, who stated that she was 34 years old and her previous husband had passed away seven years ago. Unable to make a living, she became involved with Wang. A few days ago, she went to visit a younger female friend, but Wang suspected that she was doing improper things outside. In fact, she was quite well-behaved. The police chief, based on the confessions, stated that since they had lived together for many years, there was no need for emotional disputes. Wang Yongbiao's attempt to take his own life without reason was reckless and they should both go home and reconcile.</p>

<p>Remarrying, Husband Reluctant</p>
<p>Files Lawsuit in Court</p>
<p>Yue Shaoyi, a shop assistant at the Taichang Teahouse and Food Shop near Wansheng Bridge in Ximen, had a wife, Yue Weng, who was already 39 years old, but dressed flamboyantly and considered herself still young and beautiful. Because of this, the husband was unable to provide for her, and she harassed Yue Shaoyi every day, demanding a divorce. She also made a scene at the shop every day. Yue was forced to reluctantly write an agreement, like Zhu Maichen divorcing his wife, stating that he unwillingly wrote the agreement due to his wife's pressure and would allow her to remarry. Yue Weng took the agreement and, within a few days, hired a matchmaker, Chen Shouzhi, to arrange her remarriage to Yue Baoxing, the son of Ye Degui in Zhongshi Skin Lane. Ye Baoxing was only 28 years old, a so-called old wife and young husband, but they were quite loving. However, Yue Shaoyi was not willing to do this, as it was only a temporary expedient. He did not expect his wife to use it as a genuine agreement. Therefore, he filed a complaint with the First Branch Office of the Second District, arresting Ms. Yue, Ye Baoxing, and the matchmaker, and brought them to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<p>Jiang Shaochang, a 68-year-old from Dongting Mountain, lived at No. 2 Fu'an Lane, Caiyang Corner, Wangjia. He had a son named Rongsheng, 36 years old, who worked as an accountant at the North Wharf of the Merchant Shipping Bureau. Two years ago, he married a woman named Niu through a matchmaker. Ms. Niu was 21 years old. Since their marriage, the couple's relationship had been reasonably good. However, Rongsheng had an older sister, Zhang Jiang, who had been living with her brother for many years since her husband's death. Zhang Jiang often stirred up trouble in front of Jiang's father, causing frequent disputes between Ms. Niu and her father-in-law. Shaochang was inherently stingy. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 4:00 PM, Ms. Niu's two-year-old son accidentally dropped and broke a porcelain basin that Shaochang usually used to hold teacups. Shaochang scolded her and told her to buy a replacement. Zhang Jiang also took the opportunity to support her father, and a major quarrel erupted. Ms. Niu, feeling extremely resentful, secretly left and walked to the Wangjia Wharf on the South City waterfront. Taking advantage of a moment when no one was paying attention, she jumped into the Huangpu River, hoping to end her life through suicide. The guard officer Jin Jiushan of the 15th post saw her and immediately rushed forward to rescue her. She was pulled up and taken back to the First Branch Office of the First District. The police chief summoned Jiang Shaochang and others to the station. After preliminary interrogation, he ordered them to be temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, a middle-aged woman was seen sobbing at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. She then boarded a ferry to cross the river. As soon as the ferry reached the middle of the river, the woman suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the boatman bravely rescued her and sent her back to the Pudong ferry post, who took her to the police station of the Third District. She was transferred to the Third District for interrogation. The woman confessed that her name was Long Li, 27 years old, from Zhejiang, and lived at No. 12 Kangti Road. Her husband had passed away five or six years ago, and her in-laws had abused her. Recently, they kicked her out and did not allow her to enter the house. She was filled with resentment and did not want to prolong her life, so she took this drastic measure. After confessing, she sobbed uncontrollably. The district chief, seeing her pitiful state, ordered her to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for assistance.</p>

<p>Zhang Xianqing, Director of the Shaanxi Disaster Relief of the Chinese Jishanghui, arrived in Shaanxi on April 4 and sent a letter stating that the gentlemen Zhu Ziqiao in Tianjin initiated an emergency relief effort to save lives with three yuan per person, which should have been advertised in the newspapers.

(3) The Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association sent a telegram regarding immigration. If immigrants are sent, please telegraph and vehicles will be sent to Shaanxi to pick them up.

<h3 id="e134">Zhao Shouheng's Conversation <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Shanghai News Agency encountered Zhao Shouheng, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, yesterday and inquired about matters concerning the reorganization of the bureau's affairs. Director Zhao stated that the report published the other day, "Discussion on the Reorganization of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau," contained considerable misunderstandings. Furthermore, his surname "Shouheng" was mistaken for "Zhao Chuanyu" (note: the former Shanghai director). Moreover, the item about dismissing office staff, claiming that "Zhao is going to replace almost all personnel within the bureau, from section chiefs to tea servers," is even further from the truth. Shouheng initially led the Suzhou Telephone Bureau and was transferred by order to exchange positions with the former Director Zhao Chuanyu. All the previous personnel, except for a portion who went to Suzhou to work with the former director, remain in their positions. Only a few idle and redundant staff members were slightly reduced to save expenses. As for the branch offices, such as Jiangwan, Nanxiang, and the two Zhabei branch offices, due to the simplicity of their affairs, there was no need to add office staff, so they were also appropriately reduced, and their duties were taken over by the heads of the respective branch offices. Other branch offices with more complex affairs remained as before. It was also said that each bureau has two to three hundred telephone lines. According to the Shanghai Bureau's current count, there are a total of two thousand two hundred and two lines: 1,739 lines in the main bureau, 394 in Zhabei, 39 in Jiangwan, 19 in Nanxiang, and 11 in Wusong. As for promoting women's lives, according to the facts, this is also largely inaccurate. This bureau has always employed female operators. In addition, the engineering department employs a few female clerks, all of whom have been employed by previous administrations and have not been changed. Shouheng also has no plans to employ female staff as heads of the treasury department or office staff in the document department. Director Zhao also stated that his bureau had received an order from the ministry to set up a refresher school for operators and technicians. While Shouheng was in charge of the Suzhou Bureau, he made efforts to manage this matter and achieved considerable results. This time, upon arriving in Shanghai, he also intends to actively reorganize, but due to the limited address of this bureau, there is currently no suitable location to use as a classroom. He is currently looking for a solution. In addition, plans are being made to find suitable locations for establishing employee clubs, reading rooms, and ball courts for female operators, which will be gradually implemented. As for the matter of reorganizing telephone operations and saving excessive expenses, Shouheng was determined to do so from the beginning of his term. He hopes to implement the ministry's orders to the best of his ability within the possible scope. However, the newspaper's claim of establishing a driver's school is a misunderstanding. Although Shouheng is constantly reorganizing the bureau's affairs, mistakes are inevitable. He hopes that the gentlemen of the press will provide guidance at any time.</p>

<p>This newspaper's Yokohama dispatch dated the 1st: Our delegation set off from Tokyo at 7:00 AM this morning to tour various scenic spots in Nagoya to relieve accumulated fatigue. At 4:30 PM, they took the train to Yokohama. It happened to be the anniversary of the opening of Yokohama Port. Electric lights were brilliant at night, illuminating the entire port. The team members casually looked around. They spent the night at the Weidenglongri Maru before 10:30 PM. The Yokohama Overseas Chinese will hold a meeting to comfort the delegation at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning (2nd). The Ryutian Maru is scheduled to weigh anchor at 10:00 AM in the morning. It is expected that those who come to see them off at that time will be at the height of their glory.</p>

<p>It is Difficult to Concentrate on the Competition</p>
<p>Change to Four Days and Cancel the Public Competition</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch dated the 1st: After the closing of the Far Eastern Games, public opinion is that the eight-day session seems too long. It is better to change it to four days, so that we can concentrate our minds and energy to determine the outcome, and not be tired from being too long. Public performances often have temporary non-participants, which is enough to devalue the spirit of the conference. Therefore, public opinion may cancel it in the future.</p>

<p>520,000 Spectators in Eight Days</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch dated the 1st: During the eight days of this conference, except for a rain shower, the weather was clear, so the audience was extraordinarily large. According to a survey by the Japanese Sports Association, the number of spectators in eight days exceeded 520,000, and the ticket revenue reached 120,000 yen. The daily average is about 60,000 people, with the athletics field being the most popular.</p>

<p>The Japan Association of Athletics is About to Leave the Association of Advancement</p>
<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch dated the 1st: Judging from the phenomenon, the Japan Association of Athletics seems to be withdrawing from the Japan Sports Association after the completion of the Far Eastern Games, because of the disagreement on the issue of adopting world rules for the 9th Games. The Federation has convened a meeting of staff to discuss everything. Because it was a secret meeting, the details are not yet known. However, it is heard that the members are divided into two factions, one advocating separation and the other advocating major changes in the personnel of the Japan Sports Association. According to the news from those who advocate separation, the International Student Games will be held in Darmstadt, Germany, so the Federation will probably separate from the Association. This matter is now very much concerned by the Japanese sports world.</p>

<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch dated the 1st:</p>
<p>At each conference, the host country is always criticized, but not as much as this time in Japan. Because Japan is very confident in track and field and swimming, there is no act of causing disputes. However, for the three items of basketball, football, and volleyball, means were used, and other countries' athletes were treated with partiality. Japan-style will use inexperience or ignorance of the rules as an excuse, but the referee does not follow the rules, resulting in Japanese athletes using tricks, and the other party often protests, which hinders international friendship. This is in fact against the purpose of the conference to connect feelings. For example, before the opening of the conference, there were disagreements within the organization regarding the adoption of world rules. Externally, there were negotiations on not including the eulogy of our foreign minister Wang and the Indian flag not being available. If Japan wants not to reduce the spirit of the future conference, this kind of action must be eliminated. As for the transmission of news between staff members, it can also be organized. The propaganda committee members cannot forecast the time for each competition, which makes it inconvenient for participants and spectators. As for other shortcomings, it is difficult to describe in detail. In short, Japan cannot escape people's blame, because it cannot treat people sincerely, and the referee does not follow the rules and is also biased. The end result is that disputes often arise, damaging international friendship, leaving a permanent regret in sports.</p>

<p>This newspaper's Tokyo dispatch dated the 1st: During the Far Eastern Games, many Japanese female students asked Philippine athletes for autographs. According to a survey by the Japanese police, there were 64 people, which is an educational issue that should be considered and has attracted attention from all sides.</p>

<p>(Qu from Tokyo)</p>
<p>Athletes Are Busy Signing Autographs</p>
<p>The Japanese worship athletes, especially women. During this conference, whenever athletes left the competition venue, they were surrounded by a large number of Japanese young female students, who took out their exquisite small notebooks to ask the athletes to sign their names as souvenirs. As a result, the lounge of the athletes' lodging and the corners and intersections nearby were all crowded with groups of women, hindering traffic. The staff in charge of organizing the venue posted a large advertisement saying [Athletes Refuse to Sign], but the trend of signing autographs has not diminished at all.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Upright Wu Meixian <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The trend of signing autographs is rampant, and the handiwork of female athletes is even more precious. Our country's female athletes are most admired by the crowd in the conference, and there are even more people asking them to sign their names. Ms. Wu Meixian believes that this kind of action is an elegant thing if it is done occasionally, but it is a bit boring if it is disturbed for many days. Therefore, she generally refuses. Originally, signing autographs is one of the means of international communication in the conference. In order to leave a good impression, it seems that one should not refuse people too strictly, and Ms. Wu's vigorous action may be too upright.</p>

<p>Sun Guiyun, our nation's female athlete admired by tens of thousands, made her first appearance on the 27th. We had high expectations for her. However, in the 100-meter selection, the starter (Sgauter) repeatedly made things difficult for her, nitpicking excessively, leading Ms. Sun to withdraw. In the women's 400-meter relay race, Ms. Sun ran the final leg, but due to the late handoffs by the first two runners, even though Ms. Sun's speed surpassed that of the Japanese final runner, the initial deficit was too large, and she did not succeed.</p>

<p>Around 3 PM on the 27th, during the intense track and field competitions, the sky suddenly clouded over and it began to rain. The audience was greatly troubled, when suddenly vendors transported a large batch of oiled paper umbrellas to the site, hawking them around. The audience eagerly bought them, not caring about the high prices. The vendors made ten times their profit in an instant. The Japanese people's skill in speculation can be seen here.</p>

<p>First China-Japan Basketball Game</p>
<p>(Xu Minhun)</p>
<p>Thirty-Nine to Twenty-Four... Japan Wins Over China</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) All ball games, except for tennis, are using a double round-robin system (meaning each team plays against the other teams twice). The first game was between China and Japan, held at 7:45 PM on May 24th at the newly built Meiji Jingu basketball and volleyball court. The result was a great surprise to us. A special record of the new Far Eastern Games is noted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e154">(1) The Game Situation <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>At the sound of the mobilization order, the athletes from both sides competed on the field. In less than two minutes, the Chinese team was penalized twice. Japan's Ohashi and Oda scored two points through free throws. Under the strict surveillance of the referees and inspectors, the Chinese team could not move freely, and the morale of the team was flustered. Japan's Nomura seized the opportunity to attack from afar and scored. In less than three minutes, the score was 4-0. The five Chinese players showed their might. Tang and Yao passed quickly and returned a goal. Shortly after, Yao scored two more points with a long shot. At this point, both teams had 4 points. The Chinese team then changed its plan, using long shots to catch up with Japan. However, Japan's Ohashi and Ouchi each made a free throw, and the score became tied again. Tang was agile and shot quickly, adding to the Chinese record. However, Tanaka's long shot was not weak either, and both teams competed fiercely. At the 18th minute, the scoreboard showed 13-12, with Japan in the lead. In the last minute, Ueda also scored with a long shot. The result of the first half was 15-12, with Japan winning. During the break, the spectators were worried for the Chinese team. However, the instructor and the players believed that Japan was not their opponent. They thought that the reason they were able to gain an advantage was just due to the luck of the long shots. They believed that the Chinese team would eventually win. However, after the break, in less than a minute, Japan's Ueda and Ohashi scored two consecutive goals. China's Little Yao returned a goal. Japan's Ohashi scored two more points with a long shot, making the score 21-14. At this time, China's Tang scored a free throw, and Wei scored a goal with a long shot. The score was close again, and the atmosphere of the entire court was tense. The Japanese team invigorated their spirit, and Ueda used long shots to score two more goals. Japan's Kobayashi also used a long shot, but missed. Ohashi missed a free throw. However, by the 13th minute of the second half, the score difference was already 12 points. The Chinese spectators thought that the situation was hopeless. However, the Chinese team still fought with all their might. Li Guoshen scored two points with a long shot. Liu Zhongjiang received a long pass from his teammate and shot from the left side of the basket, scoring one point. At this time, the scoreboard showed 30-22, and the Chinese supporters cheered for them. The Japanese team announced tightened security in their area, and the Chinese team could not approach. They then deployed new force Lu Zongen into the game, who made repeated long shots, but missed. Instead, the Japanese took advantage of the opportunity to attack. The Chinese army ordered a quick return to defense, but it was too late. In the last few minutes, the Japanese team, either with long shots or short passes, scored 8 points in a row, all by Ueda, and also scored a free throw. China's Lu Jun rushed forward and scored two points with a long shot. At this time, the Chinese team had good coordination and quick passing, but time was up. The gun sounded, and the game ended. The result was 39-24, with Japan winning.</p>
<h3 id="e155">(2) General Review of the Game <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese have never paid much attention to basketball, but since returning from the last time, they have actively promoted it to wipe out the shame of the past Far Eastern Games. The progress of the players was beyond our expectations. The reason they were able to win against our team can be summarized as fast and accurate shooting and passing. Most of their points were from long shots. All the team members were able to endure hardship and were never tired from beginning to end. However, in terms of formation, they were still immature. I predict that in the future Far Eastern Games, they will be a major concern for China and the Philippines. The Chinese team is a well-trained team with a lot of experience and no opponent in the country. They looked down on everything and thought that basketball in a small, nameless island nation was not worth fearing. They were too confident. As the saying goes, "Humility brings benefit, complacency invites loss," which can be a warning for the Chinese basketball team. After losing the game, they complained about the umpires, which is not the attitude a sportsman should have. However, people's hearts are different, and the strictness, accuracy, wisdom, honesty, and cunning of the umpires are also not uniform. Our team has a lot of experience, but there is still something lacking, namely, the attitude towards the umpires. The umpires have different personalities, qualities, knowledge, and experiences. During normal practice, players should eliminate all illegal and bad habits, even if there are suspicious points. Do not use the weaknesses of the umpires and develop bad habits. Even if the umpire has shallow knowledge, we must follow the rules. If there are any who are deliberately biased, do not argue with them. Even if you are wrongly penalized several times, you must remain calm and not be anxious. Under the watchful eyes of the public, those with a little conscience will not dare to openly cheat. Even if they do, public opinion will prevail, and you will still be honorable even if you lose. Otherwise, even if you argue and get angry, it will not only not help, but also cause psychological, technical, and coordination stimulation to the players, making it impossible to perform to their full potential. Often, strong teams lose to weak teams because they are fighting against the opposing team on one hand and against the umpires on the other. If this is the case, there are few who do not lose. The organizers should negotiate with them appropriately. Sometimes, there is no better option than to deal with them as they are.</p>
<p>In terms of technique, the Chinese team used a five-man zone defense. Although this defense is strict, there are several ways to break it. The Japanese team knew our situation well and had planned to break our defense with long shots. If you look at the record, most of the points scored by the Japanese were from long shots, which shows this. The Chinese team members were stable, but they were too slow in holding the ball, passing, and shooting, and often missed opportunities because of this. They also passed the ball too much, and had to pass the ball to the basket before shooting. The Japanese were agile and often stole the ball, making it impossible to get close to the basket. Therefore, they had very few opportunities to shoot. They had no choice but to change their plan and use long shots, but they had not practiced this much and were often inaccurate, so they lost more than they gained. Some team members lacked self-control, and were distracted by the umpires' fouls and the spectators' scolding. If a teammate or they themselves made a mistake, they would be anxious and show it in their actions. These are all reasons for our team's failure.</p>

<p>Our Country Can Beat the Philippine Team</p>
<p>The first day of the Far Eastern Games tennis competition featured two men's singles matches between Japan and the Philippines, and two women's singles matches between China and the Philippines. The matches took place at 1:30 PM on the newly built Sannen-cho court. Around 1,000 spectators watched from the sidelines. The weather was clear, with a gentle breeze, perfect for the matches.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Men's Singles Japan vs. Philippines <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>First Match: Bui Wins Against Philippines' Aragon</p>
<p>Second Match: Sato Wins Against Philippines' Yaguyo</p>
<p>First Match: Japan's Mr. Bui vs. Philippines' Mr. Aragon. Mr. Aragon's performance was very dull, and his shots were not accurate. Mr. Bui's serve and volley were good. As a result, Mr. Bui won 6-1, 6-1, 6-2.</p>
<p>Second Match: Japan's Mr. Sato vs. Philippines' Mr. Yaguyo. The two fought fiercely. Mr. Sato's shots were accurate and fast, befitting a top Japanese player (excluding Davis Cup players). Mr. Yaguyo was not weak either… fast… resulting in… 6… 1… Yi's</p>
<p>6-1, Yi's</p>
<h3 id="e158">Women's Singles China vs. Philippines <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>First Match: Li Xinghua Wins Against Philippines' Caliaga</p>
<p>Second Match: Mrs. Afu Wins Against China's Li Mudan</p>
<p>First Match: China's Li Xinghua defeated Philippines' Ms. Caliaga 6-1, 6-1. Just as the first men's match ended, the well-known Li sisters of China appeared. Ms. Li served first, winning two sets in a row. Ms. Caliaga tried to catch up and won one set, but her skills were not refined, and her serves often failed. Ms. Xinghua was able to conserve her energy and lost four sets in a row. Ms. Li then won the first set 6-1. Starting from the second set, Ms. Li's momentum increased, winning the first game with a score of four to two. Then, in a long rally, Ms. Caliaga won one game, which was her last win of the day. After that, Ms. Li cruised to victory, winning 6-1.</p>
<p>Second Match: Philippines' Mrs. Afu (MRF Ochoa) defeated China's Li Mudan 6-2, 5-7, 6-1. The second women's match was a fierce battle, and one of the most exciting scenes in today's women's competition. Li started the serve and was immediately at a disadvantage, losing a total of five games. Mrs. Afu had the momentum to continue, but in the sixth and seventh games, Mudan suddenly regained her spirit and her shots were effective, giving the opponent no chance to win. The audience thought the situation had changed, and China was about to turn the tide, but Mrs. Afu stepped up her efforts and won two consecutive games, winning the first set 6-2. The battle in the second set was even more intense. Mudan received a lot of cheers, and her performance was indeed strong, but she could not maintain it and ultimately lost in the third set. Initially, each won one game, and then each won two consecutive games, making the score 2-3. Mrs. Afu advanced bravely in the seventh and eighth games, gaining a 5-3 lead. Ms. Li rushed to catch up, and as a result of the bloody battle, recovered the situation with a score of 7-5, winning the second set. This winning streak, which turned defeat into victory, terrified the Philippine athlete. Mrs. Afu looked tired and moved slowly, while Mudan ran quickly to the left and right, the ball arrived where she did, and she had a smile on her face, as if she was confident. Unexpectedly, heaven did not help her. Ms. Li, after her brave fight, was inevitably negligent and was taken advantage of by the opponent. The third set of the final began, and she lost four games in a row. Although she cheered herself up and won the fifth game, it was too late to save the situation, and she lost two more games, finally losing 1-6.</p>
<p>Overall, the performance of the Japanese athletes Sato and Bui was indeed strong. There should be no problem beating the Philippines. In the future, they will have a bloody battle with our Lin and Qiu. It is hard to predict who will win. On the women's side, the two Lis are strong players, and Philippines' Mrs. Afu is also a strong opponent. The victory or defeat of the China-Philippines women's team may be decided in tomorrow's doubles match. However, the Japanese women's athletes are strong, and even if we beat the Philippines, we still need to make a special effort. In terms of the two Li's skills, Ms. Xinghua's opponent was weaker, so both games were very easy. Her serve was accurate and powerful. Ms. Mudan's performance was very good, and she was honorable even in defeat. Her ball showed special effort. However, she was too conservative and rarely attacked, allowing the enemy to conserve energy. She also used the trick of feinting to the east and attacking the west to score points. Ms. Mudan's skill in striking the ball was quite impressive, and this was how she won the sixth and seventh games of the first set. If she could use it more often when she has a good opportunity, Mrs. Afu's defeat would be no problem. I wonder if Miss Li would agree.</p>

<p>The second meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Compulsory Education Committee was held at 3:00 PM on May 29th. Attendees included Xie Bing, Zhu Jingnong, Ye Chucang, Chen Shunian, Chen Hexian, Yang Naikang, Huang Shaohong, Duan Yuhua. The chairman was Chen Hexian, and the recorder was Huang Shaohong. The meeting began as scheduled.</p>
<p>Reported Matters: The chairman reported on the state of compulsory education in various counties in Jiangsu. Matters for Discussion: 1. Amendment of the Jiangsu Provincial Compulsory Education Experimental Zone Plan. Resolutions: (1) The plan was amended and passed. (2) A detailed budget will be prepared by the Department of Education for the 19th year, limited to 150,000 yuan. (3) Wu Zhihui, Ye Chucang, and Chen Shunian were publicly recommended to discuss the funding. 2. Plan to establish [separate] and [centralized] normal schools. Resolution: This case was referred to the three members Zhu, Xu, and Xie for review, and the Department of Agriculture and Mining was requested to appoint personnel from agricultural institutions to participate. 3. First step in implementing trial compulsory education. Resolution: Passed. The meeting adjourned at 5:15 PM.</p>
<p>First Step in Implementing Trial Compulsory Education (Yang Naikang) The preliminary plan for implementing compulsory education at this National Education Conference has already been decided under the goal item: [Children who cannot continue to study for four years may be allowed to flexibly adjust their study period by using supplementary schools or self-study systems to make up for the compulsory education they should receive.] This is a consideration for impoverished children. We, on the other hand, are considering the perspective of setting up schools. Given the current economic capacity and teacher situation in each county, it is practically impossible to ensure that all school-age children can attend primary school. If we ask them to wait until the provincial and county funds are sufficient and the teachers are ready, then they will have been delayed for quite some time and will suffer a great loss.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should now adopt a [humble and down-to-earth] attitude to ensure that these out-of-school children can quickly have the opportunity to study. In 1852, Massachusetts first promulgated a compulsory education system, stipulating that children aged eight to fourteen must attend school for twelve weeks each year. This was later promoted to other states. By 1898, 22 states had a compulsory education system. The implementation of compulsory education nationwide was not completed until 1919. Japan promulgated an education system in the fifth year of Meiji, stipulating that a primary school district should be established in areas with a population of more than 600, and all children over the age of six, regardless of gender, must be sent to school. Initially, they also stipulated that they must attend school for four months each year, with a completion period of sixteen months, and then advance to a three-year simplified course. Now it has been set at six years. Looking at the past history of compulsory education in the United States and Japan, their compulsory education was also very simple at first. It was not until the country's economy was sufficient that it became what it is today. Therefore, we do not need to rush to imitate their current situation. We should start by doing what they did before.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, according to the meaning of the flexible measures resolved at this National Education Conference, we should first try to run a two-hour primary school, recruiting children around ten years old who cannot fully attend formal primary school, and force them to study for two hours every day. The content of the courses taught should be less than that of the current primary school. It is enough to have a few major subjects. Assuming that 500 hours (30,000 minutes) are taught each year, 1,500 hours (90,000 minutes) will be considered compulsory education.</p>
<p>In this way, assuming that each teacher teaches for eight hours a day, each classroom can rotate to receive four levels of children. Wouldn't one teacher be able to be used as four people, one classroom as four classrooms, and one level of funding as four levels? This is the most economical method.</p>
<p>This method is not a step backward. It is because there are too many out-of-school children now. For example, when you encounter people who are starving every day, the relief workers do not even give rice soup because the food is insufficient. They must wait until the rice is sufficient before letting them eat their fill. I'm afraid they would have starved to death long ago. Therefore, we should now use the [method of feeding rice soup to temporarily maintain their lives, gradually increasing the number of years and enriching the content step by step from simple to complex. There is no need to wait until the funding and teachers are sufficient before running the schools.</p>
<p>If you think this principle can be passed, I would like to propose a few measures to try out in a few designated counties in Jiangsu, or to designate a few places in a certain county to try out, and at the same time, we should also stipulate a few simple compulsory school attendance measures to test it.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to all national and private universities and education departments of various provinces to have the president of each school carefully supervise the graduation exams of this year's universities. The order reads:</p>
<p>It is hereby noted that Article 17 of the University Regulations stipulates that [the graduation examination shall be conducted by a committee composed of professors, associate professors, and external experts organized by the Ministry of Education, with the President as the chairman. The examination of each subject shall, to the extent possible, involve the participation of an external member. When necessary, the Ministry of Education may send personnel to supervise,] etc. However, it is noted that the organizational charter of this University Graduation Examination Committee has not yet been formulated and promulgated. All universities should have their presidents carefully supervise the graduation examinations to be held this year. This order is issued in addition to the distribution, and the department is ordered to forward it to the provincial universities for information. This order.</p>

<p>In order to reorganize local educational administration in Jiangsu Province, the Department of Education held its first meeting of selected education bureau directors on March 24th at the Department of Education. Resolutions made at that time have been adopted by the Department of Education after considering the circumstances. Key among these was the issue of a shortage of Party ideology teachers. The Department of Education has sent a letter to the provincial Party headquarters requesting the organization of a Party Ideology Teacher Certification Committee, which will begin the certification process immediately. Other issues, such as the reorganization of social education and the method of allocating newly added educational funds, will be implemented successively based on the resolutions passed and communicated to all counties for compliance. It is reported that the second meeting will be held today (June 2nd). Attendees will include representatives from twenty-one counties: Jurong, Lishui, Gaochun, Jiangpu, Liuhe, Danyang, Liyang, Nanhui, Qingpu, Jinshan, Chongming, Haimen, Yixing, Jiangyin, Lianshui, Jiangdu, Dongtai, Xinghua, Taixian, Suqian, and Baoying. The two counties, Wu and Feng, that did not attend the previous meeting due to circumstances will attend this time to make up for it. All proposed motions and reports from each county's education bureau have been submitted. Key figures from the Party and government are also expected to be invited to give speeches at the meeting.</p>

<p>Feng Zanyuan, the Director of the Education Bureau of Huaiyin County, resigned. The County Magistrate of the county, Xu Jiaqing, recommended as many as seven people to succeed him. The Jiangsu Education Department, considering this incompatible with the County Organization Law, instructed the magistrate to recommend candidates according to the regulations. The magistrate then suggested holding an examination in the county to determine the order of recommendation, citing the large number of hopefuls. The Department of Education, upon hearing this, considered it increasingly bizarre and in violation of regulations, and has issued an order rejecting the proposal.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the lunar summer festival and a Sunday. The local silver exchange and major commercial firms were mostly closed. Therefore, there was no market activity in finance, exchange, securities, yarn, cotton, flour, wheat, and miscellaneous grains.

<h3 id="e176">Finance: The Week's Gold Premium Rose 22.7 Taels <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Breaking New Records</p>
<p>Highest Peak at 544.9 Taels</p>
<p>Huge Fluctuations Throughout the Week: The volatility of the gold premium in the past week was particularly intense, with daily fluctuations of around ten taels. It almost broke through the 540-tael mark. Although rumors about the silver tax issue were not as prevalent as in the previous week, they were still occasionally raised, causing a temporary setback. The severe contraction of Da Tiao (silver futures) and foreign exchange was truly rare, leading to repeated new records. The bewilderment in the minds of industry professionals and the disarray of their decision-making were unprecedented, with no sense of certainty. It was entirely influenced by the atmosphere. The week began with a surge to a peak, followed by turbulent storms and various rumors, which briefly broke the 520-tael mark, plummeting to 518.3 taels. Subsequently, it soared again, almost reaching unprecedented heights, unexpectedly reaching a new historical peak of 544.9 taels. By the weekend, the market was relatively stable, but the underlying upward trend remained. The exchange rate, however, did not move in tandem with the gold price at the beginning of the week, but by the weekend, the arbitrage seemed to narrow slightly, not as far apart as before. Yet, the gold price was still lower than the quoted exchange rate by as much as 50 to 60 taels. As a result, the gold price continued to rise compared to the previous week. Here is a detailed account of the events of the week from May 26th to May 31st:</p>
<p>A Weekly Review of 26.6 Taels: On Monday (May 26th), the English and American silver prices declined, and foreign exchange rates contracted in four rounds, totaling three levels. The gold market continued to rise, with a daily fluctuation of over nine taels. However, this was in contrast to the exchange rate market, which only rose by six or seven taels. The day opened at 521.5 taels, with a maximum of 529.4 mace (a unit of weight) and a closing price of 525.7 mace in the afternoon. The next day, although both Da Tiao and exchange rates contracted, major speculators were selling off, leading to a chaotic market situation with dangerous waves. There were fluctuations of over ten taels, with initial strength followed by weakness. In the afternoon, it fell to 518.3 taels, coupled with a sharp increase in overnight interest rates, causing fear and uncertainty. By the close of the market, it was at 519.1 mace. On Wednesday, Da Tiao and silver prices remained unchanged, and the exchange rate market stabilized. However, there was internal tightness, and major speculators were buying, leading to another rise. It jumped up by 7 taels and zero mace. The next day, the market was very firm, and the exchange rate market rose sharply, with the exchange rate listing contracting by one and a half levels. However, people were still uncertain, and the price was lower by as much as 50 taels. It had broken through the 30-tael mark, reaching 36.5 taels at one point. As a result, sellers were active, totaling 30 taels and 6 taels. On Friday, the English and American silver prices contracted sharply, with the sterling falling by three levels, totaling 75, American dollars by 1.5 yuan, and Japanese gold jumping by over 4.5 points, totaling 1 tael, 2 mace, 4 fen, 3 li, 7 hao, and 5 si. The quoted price was lower by over 60 taels, which was rare. However, the chaos in the market was indescribable, with a variation of as much as 13 taels. In the morning, due to rumors of taxation, it rose slightly. Later, the waves surged, and an unprecedented price appeared, reaching 544.9 taels, breaking a new record. However, the internal market for sterling and Japanese gold was initially tight and then eased, so the arbitrage gradually approached. The closing price was more relaxed than the previous day. The gold premium closed at 538.5 taels. On the weekend of May 31st, Da Tiao was extended again, so the foreign exchange rate was also extended by one level. However, the internal market remained firm, and the gold market was relatively calm, fluctuating by only 4 taels, hovering around the 40-tael mark. There were no large transactions in the market because the banks were closed on June 1st and 2nd, so the exchange was also closed for two days. All long and short positions had to be settled. By the time the market closed at noon, it was 541.8 taels, a total increase of 22.7 taels compared to the previous Saturday (May 24th). The highest and lowest prices for these six days had a difference of 26.6 taels.</p>
<p>The following is a table listing the high and low prices for English and American silver prices, exchange rates, and gold premiums: Type | Highest | Lowest | Compared to Last Saturday Da Tiao (Nearby) | 18 pence 625 | 17 pence 4375 | Decreased by 1 penny 1875 Da Tiao (Distant) | 18 pence 5625 | 17 pence 25 | Decreased by 1 penny 1875 American Silver Price | 40.125 cents | 37.25 cents | Decreased by 3.25 cents Bombay Price | 52 Rupees 10 | 50 Rupees 03 | Decreased by 2 Rupees 03 English Exchange | 1 shilling 9 pence 625 | 1 shilling 7 pence 625 | Decreased by 1 penny 875 American Exchange | 43.75 yuan | 39.75 yuan | Decreased by 3.75 yuan Japanese Exchange | 1 tael 2 mace 4 fen 3 li 7 hao 5 si | 1 tael 1 mace 2 fen 8 li 7 hao 5 si | Increased by 1 mace 0 fen 6 li 2 hao 5 si Gold Premium | 544 taels 9 mace | 518 taels 3 mace | Increased by 23 taels 7 mace</p>

<p>According to yesterday's London telegram, Da Tiao silver was seen contracting again. The near-term contracted by 125 to 17 pence 4375 (equivalent to 1 shilling 8 pence 625 in English gold), and the far-term also contracted by 1875, totaling 17 pence 3125. There were a small number of sales from China, and Indian silver companies were buying. The market situation was calm. According to a New York telegram, the American silver price remained at 37.25 cents. The English-to-American exchange rate dropped by 03125, and the American-to-English exchange rate also fell by 09375, both to 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 8 li 7 hao 5 si. The Japanese-to-American exchange rate remained at 49 yuan 4 jiao 3 fen 7 hao 5 si, and the English-to-Japanese exchange rate remained at 2 shillings 032 parts of 13. The English-to-Shanghai sterling rate remained at 1 shilling 8 pence 375. The Bombay rate contracted by 3 angs, to 50 rupees 05 angs.</p>

<p>The inflow and outflow of spot public bonds remained scarce in the past week, with only 125,200 yuan traded throughout the week, including 51,200 yuan of troop reduction bonds, 29,000 yuan of consolidated 6% bonds, 18,000 yuan of disaster relief bonds, and only a few thousand yuan of other bonds. Futures were traded actively before and after the end-of-month settlement. The May contracts were suspended from trading on Tuesday to prepare for settlement, and the July contracts began trading on Wednesday. Trading was suspended again on Thursday to handle the settlement. However, the bond prices fluctuated significantly, and the market situation remained strong. The buying and selling sentiment was still very active. The total trading volume for the week was 49,015,000 yuan, a decrease of approximately 15.7 million yuan compared to the previous week. The troop reduction bonds and customs bonds were still the most popular, while other bonds were more lightly traded than before. As for the price fluctuations of each bond during the week, the seven-year continued 25, financial 96, and other bonds with scarce trading volume showed no major price changes. Compared to the previous week, the seven-year continued 25 bonds fluctuated very slightly. The June futures for seven-year 96 and other bonds all fell by more than one yuan. Due to frequent rumors of chaotic situations, the market sentiment suddenly turned weak during the week, and selling transactions increased, causing prices to fall. On Monday, although each bond had already fallen compared to the previous day, the amount did not exceed one yuan. On Tuesday, there was a sharp drop of about 2.5 yuan, and even customs bonds fell by about 2 yuan, consolidated 6% bonds and relief bonds fell by more than one yuan. On Wednesday, the market returned to a stalemate, and on Friday, the downward trend strengthened again, with troop reduction bonds falling by 1.5 to 2 yuan, consolidated 6% bonds falling by 1.7 yuan, and relief bonds also falling by a small amount. The market stabilized on the weekend. As a result, only financial bonds showed a continued upward trend compared to the previous week, while other bonds fell by about 2 yuan. The June futures for troop reduction bonds fell by as much as 4 to 5 yuan. However, judging from the current market situation, if the situation improves slightly, bond prices may rise again soon. The following is a statistical table of the high and low prices and fluctuations of each bond during the week (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Indian Cotton Also Downstream</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was closed. English cotton futures fell by 2 points, while the spot price rose by 1 point. The Egyptian cotton spot price fell by 10 points. The Indian cotton market was weak, with Pingor falling by 2 Rupees, Omra falling by 3 Rupees, and White Rozi falling by 4 Rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (telegram from the 31st).</p>

<p>Exchange Rate Plummets... Raw Cotton Soars</p>
<p>Major Players Reverse Positions... Market Suddenly Tightens</p>
<p>Near-Term Up 2 Taels... Distant-Term Up 2.5 Taels... Spot Prices Also Up 1 to 2 Taels</p>
<p>The yarn market remained flat and weak at the beginning of the week, but the situation was tighter. Because of the long-term stalemate, after the Guangdong factory shipped out a large batch of transactions the previous week, the factories' stockpiles eased, and the market became harder due to stronger sentiment. However, the chaotic situation and the lack of activity from outside players to go long prevented any major movements. Before long, exchange rates plummeted, and raw cotton soared, stirring up the market. A portion of major players, such as Richang, Tianlong, and Yiyu, reversed their positions from short to long, buying back about 30,000 bales in the past few days, with Richang being the largest. After the market absorbed this large amount, the situation became increasingly tight, and the market suddenly tightened. As a result, the price increase was very sharp. The resulting premium for yarn was up 2 taels in the near term and 2.5 taels in the distant term compared to the previous week. The Khesh market remained weak due to the impact of the war, and the buying side was still weak. It is expected that there may be some development in the future. If the actual demand picks up, there is hope that the distant term will break through the 6-tael mark. However, it was found that manufacturers and bulls were selling short during the price increase. The total transaction volume for the week was 99,100 bales. The Khesh market was mostly bought by Sichuan, Xuzhou, inland, and other parties, totaling 8,420 bales. Fellow merchants took in 2,500 bales, with prices rising by 1 to 2 taels. The following is a breakdown of the quantities bought by each party:</p>
<p>Party | Bales | Party | Bales Changsha | 180 | Tianjin | 160 Guangdong | 900 | Miscellaneous | 600 Xuzhou | 1,830 | Inland | 1,100 Fellow Merchants | 2,500 Sichuan | 2,100 | Shantou | 550 Zhenjiang | 1,000</p>

<p>Not Much Stock... Hankou Tightens</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Drops Continuously... Short Sellers Panic</p>
<p>The cotton market originally had the power to rise, but due to the high price in Hankou, the various sources lacked inventory and the supply was thin. In the previous month, it was suppressed by the 20,000 dan of H. Nann cotton and machinery cotton, but after the Hankou market bought in, the market turned hard. At the right time, the exchange rate shrank strangely, and the Hankou market tightened without releasing. The sellers discovered a state of panic, and the market then exploded. In these few days, the intensity of the rise was unprecedented this year. This situation was caused by the shorts being squeezed too much, and once they encountered an opportunity, the rise could not be contained. However, the Hankou market and the H. Nann market sold 131 million dan during the frenzied rise, so the market situation on Saturday's closing was relatively calm. However, most of the shorts were in an abnormal state. Each month rose by 1 tael and 113 mace compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the week was 197,600 dan. The sources included 700 dan of Yaohua cotton and 1,110 bales of Tonghua cotton. Manufacturers purchased 23,764 dan, and brokers purchased 25,800 dan. The American cotton situation was extremely flat. The following is a breakdown of the quantities bought by each broker and manufacturer:</p>

<p>Receiver: Factory</p>
<p>The May flour delivery was completed smoothly yesterday. A total of 24,000 bags of warehouse receipts were delivered, including 18,000 bags of Fufeng Yutong red and blue cars, 4,000 bags of Green Wheat Root, and 2,000 bags of Returned Green Soldier Ships. It is heard that the receiver is a certain large factory. Because the over-extraction of goods has led to the reverse acceptance, the high squeezing of the market at the end of the month may also be one of the reasons. As for the observation of the new wheat approaching next month, if the weather is good, the trend should turn weak in June. However, below July, the inverted hanging is too huge, and there may be a separate high phenomenon, because the new flour stalls should not have this phenomenon. A total of 5745,000 bags were traded in futures, slightly more than last month. The details are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram: Cuba and New York have no telegrams, Java spot sugar price is still 9.75, June sugar price is 9.375, which is similar to the previous telegram, and July price is 9.25, which is 125 lower than before. The association market Liu Pan, Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white has been rising since the exchange rate rose. The market atmosphere has turned sharply tense. In the past two days, it has been rising step by step, with a great sense of soaring. Yesterday's market transaction price was 7 taels 3 and a half cents, which is 1 cent higher than before, and the households are still short, and the buyers are also sparse, so the market is not transacted, only stable. Ground fine granulated white is 7 taels 4 cents 2 and a half, No. 22 medium granulated white is 7 taels 2 and a half cents. The transaction is even less. The market is not weak. Japanese sugar is quite active and the market is also rising. J Mark is 8 taels 2 and a half cents, ER Mark is 8 taels 1 and a half cents, Meiji YP Mark is 7 taels 9 and a half cents, YT Mark is 7 taels 7 and a half cents, and Minghua YT Mark is 7 taels 7 cents.

<p>Cocoon Production is Poor, Cocoon Costs are High, and Silk Merchants' New Silk Prices are Higher</p>
<p>The United States and Japan have successively thrown new factories into the market, which has risen by another 30 taels.</p>
<p>Last week, the local foreign silk market continued to rise. The reason is that the new cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have all reported poor harvests, and the cocoon prices are not cheap. The cost of silk is still high. The manufacturers are negotiating with European merchants for new silk transactions at higher prices. Last week, the overseas silk sales of China turned to a turning point. The United States and Japan each hoarded new factories, and the market atmosphere turned better. Although the transaction was not smooth, the market price rose by another 30 taels. At the end of last week, a total of 23,000 packages of new cocoons from Zhejiang Province were shipped to Shanghai. Each silk factory opened new cocoons in one day, and only 60% of the silk factories in Shanghai started work. Not much old silk was exported, and each foreign bank had more than 1,600 packages of silk in stock. This week, the inland flood season has been continuously loaded due to excessive rain. The new cocoon baking discount is generally 320 taels to bake 100 catties of dry cocoon, and the improved seed is 520 catties to 560 catties (dry cocoon). The silk cost of each tan of silk from 600 to 700 catties of this kind is still high. The Chinese silk prices in overseas markets were strong last week. The Chinese silk prices in the US and French markets at the end of last week are listed below (New York price per pound, unit gold yuan, Lyon short kilogram price, unit franc)</p>

<h3 id="e187">Record of Ye Dehui's Prison · Bing <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Ning-Han united to eliminate the communists. The Hunan May Fourth Incident was a major turning point. Before the May Fourth Incident, there was a major prison case in Hunan that shocked people at home and abroad. That was Ye Dehui's execution. At that time, the Hunan party and government were in the hands of the so-called leftists. The provincial city had a special court dedicated to judging reactionary cases. In half a year, there were already twenty or thirty local tyrants and evil gentry who were sentenced to death. Among them, the execution of Ye Dehui was the most eye-catching. Ye Dehui's reputation was praised by some as a seed of reading in the present world, while others vilified him as a modern literary monster. On the night Ye Dehui was arrested, he was returning from the residence of a certain female performer. The arresters were the self-defense forces of the Provincial Farmers' Association. He was sent to the special court that evening and executed the next morning. Ye Dehui was well acquainted with important figures in the Wuhan National Government such as Tan Weigong. It was also heard that He Jian had also been a student of his. Being detained in prison for a long time should have led to bail. A certain member of the special court, who was also a department head of the provincial government, was Ye's student and insisted on a speedy execution. Thus, Ye was executed as a remnant of the imperial system (he had been the chairman of the Hunan Preparatory Peace Association).</p>
<p>Before Ye was arrested, he once said to people, "I am not an evil gentry, but a rogue gentry." "Rogue" is a term used by the people of Hunan to scold rascals, similar to what is called "gangster" in Shanghai dialect. He also joked to people, "Some people say I am a literary monster. There are no literary monsters in Hunan, only word monsters." One is Yi Yincun and the other is Cao Mengqi. Yi liked epigraphy, and his characters were said to have silver hooks and iron brushes. Cao was good at classical Chinese prose, and his characters learned from the Northern Stele and referred to the Yan style, tracing back to the seal script to form his own style. Both of them knew Ye, so Ye made this joke. Ye liked to talk about the art of the bedroom. He collected a lot of secret performance pictures and published the "Shuangmei Landscape Collection" to circulate. He once criticized Zhang Jingsheng for talking about sexual art as an amateur. He firmly believed that he was an expert.</p>
<p>Ye was originally from Suzhou. Because he had lived in Hunan for a long time, he became a Hunanese. There were two pockmarked gentlemen in Hunan. Since the Wuxu Reform, they had been feared by the authorities below the governor. One was Ye Pockmark and the other was Wang Pockmark. Wang Pockmark was Wang Xianqian. Both of them were the main figures in the Yijiao Collection and were difficult for the Hunan reformers of the Wuxu Reform.</p>
<p>Ye's courtesy name was Huanbin and his sobriquet was Xieyuan. He wrote many works that were famous at home and abroad. Many Japanese scholars also praised him. He once wrote his own birthday preface. The first sentence began with "The people of the country all say that Ye Dehui is killable." Later, he ended badly, which was probably what is called a literary prophecy.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Unprecedented Gold Mine Discovered in Taiwan <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Autumn Water ··</p>
<p>According to the Japanese news agency, a very rich gold mine has recently been discovered on the island of Taiwan. The discoverer is Dr. Jisaburo Tokobori, a professor in the Engineering Department of the Tokyo Imperial University. Dr. Tokobori has been studying mineralogy for many years and has a deep understanding of it. This trip to Taiwan was an unintentional discovery of an unprecedented source of wealth for the country. His satisfaction can be imagined. The doctor recently took the specimen back to China. For a time, the government and the public were shocked and regarded it as a grand event. A reporter from a certain newspaper visited the doctor at his home and inquired about the details. It was published in the newspaper and translated for the people of the country. It should be known that although Taiwan is small in area, it has always been a barrier to our country. The story of Zheng Chenggong at the end of the Ming Dynasty should also be vaguely in our minds. I don't know that the source of profit in it is so innumerable. The country has heard of it, and it is also felt in the heart.</p>
<p>The gold is worth about 500 million yuan. The doctor said that the wealth of gold in Taiwan is unimaginable. It is extremely difficult for me to give an exact number at this time. However, I am confident that once excavated, the total amount will be worth at least 500 million yen. The gold mine is located within 15 miles of the eastern coast of Taiwan, away from Lun Ge Karenko. The area spans nearly 150 miles, which is also shocking.</p>
<p>Gold sand is available along the street. The gold mines in the area are all contained in sand and gravel and are alluvialized by water. Therefore, there are traces of it on the ground. I (the doctor himself) also picked up gold sand and gravel in rivers, mountains, and plains. After chemical tests, the gold content is extremely rich. Even on the streets of the city, this kind of gold sand can be seen from time to time. I once picked up a little stone from a small street in a small village. After returning to the test, it actually contained gold. The richness of the gold mine in Taiwan can be imagined. The so-called "gold is available everywhere" exists in Taiwan. Therefore, the gold mine in the area is extremely easy to excavate. It is not like the gold mines in North Korea and other places. Gold seedlings are not seen unless they enter a place 100 feet deep. The gold mines in Taiwan are all floating on the ground. Excavation is effortless. Traces are not seen until 120 feet below. It is a unique source of wealth in East Asia and a gold mine that has never been seen in history in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e189">True Love Tragedy ·· Electricity <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>In the American publishing industry, there is a very popular magazine called [True Story]. The materials in this book are mostly taken from the bizarre facts in society and described and narrated. Because the true facts are always very emotional and reasonable, they are more popular. The good works in this magazine often become the material for Hollywood movies. For example, the recent film [The Strange Case of Killing His Wife] was adapted from a novel in this magazine.</p>
<p>Regarding the shooting of films based on true events, it has been seen frequently in our country's film industry. However, whether in Europe, America, or our country, the materials for this kind of film mostly focus on love. Especially on the tragedy of love.</p>
<p>Like the love case between Huang Huiru and Lu Genrong before, it was a very tortuous love tragedy. Therefore, the Mingxing Film Company once filmed a movie about the love between Huang and Lu, which was very popular. The love case between Ma Zhenhua and Wang Shichang, although the plot is very simple, is indeed a love tragedy. Therefore, some people have also made it into a movie, which is also very popular.</p>
<p>We know that the value of tragedy lies in making people more emotional. The true tragedy, because it is emotional and reasonable, can naturally arouse the audience's sympathy. It is best to use this kind of material to make films.</p>
<p>Recently, our country's Mingxing Film Company has another new film called [A Red Egg]. It is also adapted from a true story. It is said that this story is very popular in Ningbo. It is about a very virtuous girl who married a man who was born with no genitals. Unfortunately, because of a red egg given to someone else's newborn child, the girl was unjustly put to death for no reason. As a result, a good family was filled with desolation and misery.</p>
<p>I think that in this film, the cruelty of the old ethics and the tragic circumstances of the old families can certainly be brought into play. Then, with the twists and turns of the facts and the dazzling silver, it will definitely make people feel lingering and affectionate sympathy.</p>

<p>Early summer is clear and peaceful, but there are more storms. My wife has been bored at home since she recovered from her illness. The day before yesterday, she took advantage of the sunny weather to come to Wuxi. She will take a panoramic view of the lakes and mountains from afar. I and I sipped tea in the park, in the depths of the green shade. We took a short rest and then went to Chong'an Temple in front of the temple. I wandered around at will and bought some odd bits and pieces. There are hundreds of plays and miscellaneous things gathered here, which is no different from the Xuanmiao Temple in Suzhou and the City God Temple in Changzhou. On the side of the market, there was someone selling goldfish. There were dozens of fish swimming in the clear water. All of them were red. Only two of the larger ones were dark black and golden yellow, intertwined to form a pattern. Their appearance was especially pleasing. The owner pointed to them and said, "This is the dragon breed." His intention was to be quite odd. My wife loved them so much. So I asked me to pay four small silver coins and get this pair of treasures. She was happy, as if she had obtained Xuan Yu's double rings and Fengcheng's two swords. The owner also put them in a glass bottle and tied them with colored silk. So when we walked, we took turns carrying them. When we sat, we placed them quietly on the table and enjoyed watching them sip green algae and go up and down in the waves. That night, we stayed at the hotel. She said that she would take them back to her hometown tomorrow to break the loneliness of the empty boudoir. When we explored them the next morning, they were all stiff. My wife was shocked and did not expect it. We bitterly explored the cause of their illness. I smiled and said, "Let's not talk about other things for the time being. How much is the capacity of this small bottle? They have lost all their freedom, so that heroes have no place to use their weapons, and they are as cramped as horses under a carriage. I knew they wouldn't last long. I just wanted to take pleasure in your intentions for a while." My wife frowned and said, "In that case, they were originally lively mandarin ducks. I loved them, but instead killed them. What can I do with my feelings?" Therefore, I asked Yu to express my condolences to them, saying, "The eight petals of the lotus platform have been exiled. The double scales of the pearl sea have come out. Their tails are like hibiscus. Their patterns are like tortoiseshell. Their eyes are like amber. Their bodies are like coral. They just crossed the waves and were beautiful. They washed the clear ripples to make them clear. They were already happy and were about to pass away. Suddenly, they were entangled by silkworms and greeted each other. They were killed by peacocks peeping into the mirror. They were confused by the lights of the red finch. Du Fu stood by the bridge and looked into the distance. Su Shi stroked the railing and moved his feelings. I was happy to get two pearls at the same time. Why did the Udumbara flower appear in a flash? Stroking the remains to hurt my soul, I regretted that I could not see this Zhi. Could it be that the oriole crossed the Ji and the Mac crossed the Wen? I believe that the relocation of the land is not good. Or the colorful clouds are easy to dissipate and the flowers</p>

<p>Matisse's Sixtieth Birthday (D)</p>
<p>Matisse broke away from the examples of Moreau and Rembrandt. He gradually abandoned habitual laws such as "compositional balance" and "tonal reduction." He did not transform the faces of the characters in the book because of the "plastic" concavity and convexity caused by light and darkness. He used thick brushstrokes, skillful lines, and the carvings of a palette knife to show people the deep taste of decoration on the drawing board.</p>
<p>He focuses on pure, unmixed tones, arranging them at equal densities on their irreplaceable light qualities. Comparing him to the art of Édouard Manet is an extreme of perception. Paul Signac (a representative of Neo-Impressionism, still alive and the leader of the Independent Salon) reasonably explained the direct line between the two periods of the French school in his book "From Delacroix to Neo-Impressionism." But he neglected the last leg. In fact, the road to victory is from Delacroix to Matisse. Matisse's colors are not based on scientific theory, but entirely on self-observation, emotional connections, and experiential experience. Like Signac's painters, stimulated by Delacroix's works, he paid attention to the principle of complementary colors. His scientific knowledge directly gave him a certain color. Matisse worked hard to use the color tones that could generate his own emotions to modulate. But his color tones also have a necessary proportion. Sometimes, for this reason, he has to change the shape of the characters, and the structure is also modified. Because of these, everyone called him the leader of the Fauvist school twenty years ago. In fact, the superb coloring of the Fauvist school is their characteristic.</p>
<p>Matisse is a colorist in the sense of glass painting, but not in the sense of Rubens (the Dutch master is good at using gorgeous colors). The lines are gone. Beyond the scope of color, he broke through the color tones. Just like bullet marks that broke the glass, it makes the reader feel the primitive painting. The flat structure of his outline is all Arabian style. The tendency of line drawing and the norm of rhythm all have a kind of dynamic vitality in Matisse's works, just like an electric wire with current passing through it. This primitive rhythm gives the form a system of simplification. It is because the exaggeration of depicting deformed characters often makes the characters in his paintings synthesize and deform. Matisse himself has said, ["If you draw a woman's body, first, you must make her beautiful and meaningful. The rest of the things will come out of this. Relying on the main line, try to extract the meaning of that body as much as possible. At first glance, the surface is not very attractive, but it is full of greater and more human charm in this image that will gradually stimulate the viewer's heart..."]</p>
<p>Matisse purely considers the decorative effects of linear, color, and composition to create. In order to pursue pure artistic inspiration, he used extremely strong contrasting colors. After his sixtieth birthday, he followed Gauguin to Tahiti in South Africa on March 1. I think that in the future, he will definitely have many works praising the exotic customs and expressing the scenery of the South. Perhaps the brush of this genius will make the French style of painting turn to the primitive style of Egyptian stone carvings.</p>

<p>New Discovery</p>
<p>Chekhov's Unpublished Play During His Lifetime. Tolstoy did not like the kind of plays Chekhov wrote. He once said to Chekhov, "Shakespeare writes bad plays enough, but you write even worse than he does."</p>
<p>This statement is rather surprising, but Tolstoy had his own reasons. Some of Chekhov's published plays are "un-dramatic" dramas, in other words, they are static, lacking dynamic scenes and dramatic plots. Gray characters live gray lives. What moves the reader or audience is not strong and lively action, but weak and mediocre personalities. This is why Chekhov's plays can win the sympathy (and thus the welcome) of readers, and it is also the difference between Chekhov's plays and other people's plays. It is also the main reason why Tolstoy did not like Chekhov's plays.</p>
<p>Chekhov's plays are a genre of their own, just like his novels are a genre of their own. But he did not become such a genre from the beginning of writing plays. It was only after a long period of exploration that he discovered and grasped his unique style. There has been a lot of development and progress in the meantime. This can be seen by looking at his recently discovered manuscript.</p>
<p>A play by Chekhov has recently been discovered, which was not published before. The author probably thought that this work could not be published, so there was no title. Therefore, the original version was published under the title "An Unpublished Play, by Chekhov." Now someone has translated it into English and given it the name "That Useless Man Platonov" (That Wortble</p>
<p>ss Pellow Platonov). For the sake of simplicity, let's call it "That Useless Man."</p>
<p>Those who open this play with the intention of seeing works like "The Cherry Orchard" and "The Three Sisters" will undoubtedly be disappointed, because this is still his immature work. However, if we put aside art, then such a discovery is not common and is invaluable. Moreover, although the technique has not reached perfection, the author's genius has repeatedly revealed itself in the technique, and there are quite a few similarities with his later mature works. This allows us to see the progress of genius.</p>
<p>"That Useless Man Platonov" is the beginning of Chekhov's career as a playwright. This is the result of his first serious attempt to write a play. Although he had tried twice before, as far as we know, both times were with a playful attitude and could not be regarded as serious creations. This play was written in 1880, when Chekhov was only twenty years old and still studying at Moscow University, just starting to submit articles to various magazines to test his literary talent. The signature was the strange "Antosha Cbckhonte." He wrote some humorous essays and short stories, and submitted them to some second- and third-rate magazines. When he wrote this "Platonov," he obviously had great hopes. He dreamed that this play could be performed in a large theater in Moscow, and that he could be transformed overnight from a popular and humble writer to a great writer. However, after he sent the play, the heroine of the theater did not like the play, so Chekhov followed her instructions and began to revise it. But he later put the play aside and stopped the work. Why? Was it because he was busy studying medicine and writing humorous works to make money and had no time for this, or was it because this sensitive and timid young man felt ashamed and angry after being rejected? We don't know. All we know is that nineteen years after Chekhov's death, in 1923, this work was discovered from his old pile of papers, and later published in Moscow.</p>
<p>Technically, this play is incomplete, but in form it is complete. He has a whole story. The content of the story is roughly as follows: Mikhail Vasilyevich Platonov is a rural teacher. His character is noble, and at heart he is moral, but unfortunately he has too strong lust for women, and he is born without the ability to make decisions, without the ability to choose or take. When he encounters women, he has no way out. He can't leave, and he can't stay. He can't have consistent thoughts, and he can't have consistent actions. In short, besides lying softly on the sofa and suffocating himself in that kind of indecisiveness, self-pity, and atmosphere full of eroticism, he has no other way. He is already married. His wife, Sasha, is loyal and gentle, only giving him happiness and not giving him pain, but intellectually, she is much lower than him, so he is dissatisfied with her, and she has no ability to control him, so his lust goes to find another way out, thus stirring up the matter of being in love with three women at the same time.</p>
<p>The first woman is Anna Petrovna, a middle-aged widow who has been interested in him for a long time. He was about to turn to Anna when he suddenly received a letter from Sophia, which made him hesitate. Sophia Ivanovna is Anna's daughter-in-law, whom Platonov fell in love with before he got married. At this time, he felt that things were difficult. Just when he was helpless, suddenly another woman ran in to interfere. This is Maria Yefimovna, also one of his admirers. This time, it was completely ruined. Our Platonov was entangled in this big dispute and could not get out. So in the end, we saw him drunk, surrounded by Anna, Sophia, and Maria. At the same time, his wife, it is said, had swallowed red-headed matches and was dying of poisoning. Sophia was extremely angry at this time, so she picked up a pistol and shot Platonov. She didn't hit him with the first shot (this is an old Russian play trick). She shot him with the second shot, and he died. So this helpless and useless person was given a solution by others.</p>
<p>This play can only be said to be a tragedy, but some parts are really funny. This is Chekhov's characteristic, and it is already revealed in an immature work. Moreover, there are many embryos of later mature works in this play, as if those later mature works all grew out of this play. For example, the protagonist Platonov's hopeless, willless, and neurotic character is very similar to the protagonist of Chekhov's later work "Ivanov." If it weren't for the different plot, we could simply say that "Ivanov" is an adaptation of this play. Furthermore, the Voinitsev aristocratic family, which becomes a large part of the background of the play, and the sentimental atmosphere surrounding the poverty and decline of this family, is obviously the embryo of the basic sentiment revealed in "The Cherry Orchard." There are many such similarities.</p>
<p>It is obvious that all the sentiments, themes, and characters that will be present when the technique matures in the future have already crystallized at the age of twenty. In this respect, "Platonov" has its value.</p>

<p>(B) Drama</p>
<p>Leike (Sven Lange, 1868) His drama lacks vitality and is art for art's sake. The Land, written in 1915, has the passion of battle. His plays include "The Victim" (1896), "The Criminal" (1903), Samson and Delila (1909), "The First Battle" (1929), etc. The last one is about Brandt's childhood life.</p>

<p>(C) Poetry</p>
<p>Lu'erdan (Yaldemar Rordam, 1872) He is the son of a pastor. He enjoys a high reputation in the Danish poetry world. "Sun and Clouds," written in 1895, is very mediocre. His poems contain many descriptions of sex. Lu'erdan is diligent and studious, but overworks himself and gets a nervous breakdown. Beourelf (1899) was written while he was sick. In 1897, "Three Ropes" and in 1901, "Danish Language." Later, the author got help from friends and went to SchwatZuald and Italy for sightseeing, using this opportunity to recuperate. Later, he recovered his health. In 1902, he wrote a Gudrnud Dyre, which aroused much attention and discussion, and can be said to have caused a sensation for a time. In addition to lyrical poetry, Lu'erdan also wrote novels and plays, but none of them achieved success. He is most famous for his long poems, which are very symbolic and have a deep influence. From 1922 to 1923, he wrote Jens</p>
<p>Hva'sofulvlcjg (I-II). In 1925, he wrote the play "The Luck of Buddha's Pet." He was deeply influenced by Oehle nsc</p>
<p>blager, Gendtving, Wintber, Slaocbm</p>
<p>ann, and other writers. In 1918, he compiled "Selected Poems of Twenty Years" ( ). His main works are "The Old Pastor" (1917), "Pastoral Songs of the City" (1918), "Crossing the Indian Ocean" (1920), "Bird Song" (1924), and "Flower Poems" (1925). The content of the poems is mostly about life overcoming disease, love songs, and homesickness. He describes scenery not only with light, but also with air and color.</p>
<p>Hofmann (Kai Hoffmann, 1874) published "Lily in the Dark" in 1899. The author was deeply influenced by French symbolism. The themes he depicts are the sea, love, and patriotism.</p>
<p>Larsen (Hoger Larsen, 1875) wrote "Land" in 1904 and published "Selected Poems" in 1917. His poems mostly depict rural scenery.</p>
<p>Hansen (Olol Hansen, 1879) translated Dddest and wrote "Riverside" (1913) and "Mill" (1915), etc.</p>
<p>Remestod (Cbristian Rimestod, 1878) was also influenced by French symbolism. The author is also a critic and wrote "A History of New Danish Poetry." Nielsen (L. Nielsen, 1871) is a songwriter.</p>
<p>Regarding "Modern Danish Literature," I have roughly talked about it above. In the Danish literary world, we can summarize it and say that there are two special phenomena. The first is that most writers depict the local customs and the suffering of farmers. The second is that the success of a work is mostly above tens of thousands of words, and the author also spends several years of effort to produce a masterpiece.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Anecdotes from the Literary World <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Goethe and Schiller's Friendship</p>
<p>Goethe first met Schiller in 1779, when he was thirty years old, but he didn't have the opportunity to speak until the summer of 1788, when he was thirty-nine years old, when he was playing with King Taiyin in Roteltertd.</p>
<p>After that, their friendship never left a warm state until death. Therefore, the depth and enthusiasm of their friendship is rare in the history of all literary figures. However, they had opposite personalities and circumstances. In Germany at that time, it could be said that they were in the position of twenty competitors.</p>
<p>Due to the difference in their personalities, the same appearance was completely different. Goethe had a broad forehead and sunken, huge eyes. His dignified appearance could make people think of his greatness at a glance. Schiller's appearance seemed to be the opposite of Goethe's. He had a thin face, but his eyes were bright and shiny, and his head and neck were thin and long. When he walked with his head down, he looked like a walking camel.</p>
<p>Goethe liked cleanliness, fresh air, and wanted to live in a well-lit house, but Schiller, on the contrary, couldn't start writing without the smell of rotten apples.</p>
<p>Goethe wanted to start writing in the clear morning, while Schiller had to be stimulated by coffee and champagne in the middle of the night before he could start writing.</p>
<p>Schiller was ten years younger than Goethe, but he died before Goethe. He died on May 9, 1805, at the age of sixty-four. At that time, the Weimar Theater stopped to express its condolences. When people heard this unfortunate news, everyone was amazed at the death of this genius.</p>
<p>At that time, Goethe had been bedridden for a long time, so he could not go to comfort his sick old friend. Until after Schiller's death, no one dared to report to Goethe, because he himself was old and bedridden, and could not bear the grief of the death of a beloved friend. At that time, the people living with him got the news and went outside to discuss whether to report it, but Goethe had already noticed something strange and asked,</p>
<p>"I know, is Schiller in danger?" After he said this sentence, he sighed incessantly. That night, the old Goethe's room was particularly quiet. The next morning, when a woman came to Goethe's room, he asked sadly,</p>
<p>"Yesterday I thought Schiller was in danger, is it true?"</p>
<p>At that time, the woman saw Goethe's concerned face and didn't know how to answer. So, unknowingly, she covered her face with a handkerchief and cried.</p>
<p>Goethe saw such an attitude, and of course understood completely, so he shouted,</p>
<p>"Ah, Schiller is dead?"</p>
<p>"Yes,"</p>
<p>The woman answered while crying.</p>
<p>"Ah, Schiller is dead?"</p>
<p>Goethe shouted twice in a row, and then used his hand to cover his eyes, which were about to burst into tears.</p>
<p>Goethe lived two years longer than Schiller. He died on March 2, 1832 and was buried next to Schiller's tomb. Although they have died, the shells of their souls are still placed together. (Ping)</p>

<p>On the fifteenth of this month, the director of the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau will open a public art exhibition in Shanghai. Hanli Company's newly invented Zhongling air pressure printing machine is practical and artistic, and is completely domestically produced. The convenience of printing is enough to defeat imported mimeograph machines and recover foreign exchange. The company's manager sent a letter to the director of the Education Bureau, requesting permission to join the service at the exhibition. The director was extremely welcomed, and specially summoned Chen Nansun, the deputy director of Hanli Company's business department, to carry out a trial. The results were excellent. To encourage art and promote domestic goods, he personally wrote dozens of words to show his encouragement.</p>
<p>Heji Company announced that the various red and white wines and brandy wines produced by our company's Yantai Chinese Winery are pure and mellow, and are made from high-quality raw materials. They are cheap and good, and have long been popular throughout the country. Now, in order to give preferential treatment to customers, we are holding a buy-one-get-one-free event. Guanshengyuan, Taikang Company, Sincere Company, and Sanyang Nanhai Company in Nanjing Road in this city all have distribution.</p>
<p>Weihua Advertising Company sent a letter saying that we have obtained reliable information from the banking community that the Pacific Company had a surplus in its business last year. Because it is particularly cautious about ordering, it settles the price of shillings at any time, so it is not affected by foreign exchange. Recently, it is still operating as usual, and there is no declaration of liquidation. The rumors outside are all false.</p>
<p>Sanyou Society announced that our company's white fine cloth sheets are soft, clean, white, comfortable, absorbent, and non-sticky. They are very wonderful for use in hot weather.</p>
<p>The Daming Hat Factory outlet at the intersection of Wangping Street, Nanjing Road, announced that since the official opening of our factory (on the 20th), customers have still been very crowded, and more than a thousand various straw hats have been sold every day. This is because the price is cheap and the quality is good. The Shanghai Branch of Pathe Records announced that the famous actor Xu Biyun has long been good at Tsing Yi and Hua Shan opera, and has enjoyed great success in the north for many years. Xu Ling has come to Shanghai several times to perform her skills, and has also been well received by all circles. Xu Ling's opera singing is very good, so whether it is Xipi Erhuang, she has the wonderful sound of piercing clouds and cracking silk, and the sound of gold and jade, and her pearly throat is round and moist, and it is very tasteful to listen to. Our company, in response to the requests of all circles, specially invited Xu Ling to record films. Xu Ling also admired our company's reputation, and readily agreed, and specially went south at the end of last month and recorded many films in our company, including Yutangchun Qijie, Green Pearl, Xue Qiongying, and Yellow Crane Tower. There were also two singers, Xiao Kuiguan and Zhu Rongkui, who came with her to sing, which made it even more wonderful.</p>
<p>Qihua Company, Nanjing Road, announced that our company's shoe department has newly arrived from the United States a large number of women's summer canvas rubber-soled shoes in many styles, which are the latest styles on the market. They are durable, beautiful, and inexpensive. Also, there are many kinds of women's string-soled, transparent-faced leather shoes newly arrived from France, which are also the latest and most suitable shoes for summer.</p>
<p>Jiufu Company announced that the Hangzhou Municipal Government distributed the Shengdan pills donated by our company on Baik Road last year to police officers to save them from diseases. They benefited the policemen on duty, the street cleaners, and the pedestrians, and the benefits were quite a lot. This year, we still follow the example and discuss the donation. Our company has prepared 5,000 yuan and sent it to the Municipal Government Health Department for receipt.</p>
<p>The Chinese Institute of Engineering announced that since our association has been handling job introductions and has been in close contact with the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center and the Chinese Construction Association, the affairs have become increasingly numerous. We have learned that there are still no candidates for the following three jobs: (1) A certain power plant needs an electrical engineer who specializes in managing a 100KM generator; (2) A certain foreign company plans to recruit a draftsman, but he must be able to check the drawings of steel windows, salary negotiable; (3) A certain company needs a chemist, salary negotiable. If there are those who meet the qualifications for the above requirements, please come to the Chinese Institute of Engineering at No. 7 Ningbo Road to discuss in person. Our association is currently quite concerned that there is insufficient registration of engineering talents, which makes it difficult to investigate when there is an opportunity. If other engineering talents are willing to register with our association to seek suitable positions, they are also welcome.</p>

<p>Youlian Film Company announced that the martial arts film "The Wild Red Heroine" was premiered at the Central Theater on the 30th, with a stage play added. Because of the icing on the cake, it was full before the premiere time, so that later audiences had no room to insert their feet. The grand occasion can be imagined. A show will be added at 9:30 am today, and all the stars will still be on stage to comfort the audience's elegant hopes. The second episode will be shown from tomorrow, and the stage play will also be changed.</p>
<p>Xinxin Garden announced that recently, in addition to striving for progress in various recreational activities and greatly renovating the interior, we have also worked hard to reduce the amount of tourist funds. Therefore, from today onwards, we will offer special discounts, and the ticket price will be reduced to two cents. Our garden has a high and refreshing place, and the recreational activities are excellent. Now that the price has been reduced, there will definitely be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>The World Grand Theater, located at the corner of Qingyun Road and Dongbaoxing Road, Zhabei, announced that the Kai Star Company's eleventh episode of Red Lotus Temple was shown yesterday and today, and every show was full. Today, in order to avoid congestion, a show will be added from 1 pm to 3 pm. This film is the last day in our theater. Please come early, everyone, so as not to miss it.</p>
<p>Youlian Film Company announced that the long-awaited martial arts organ film "The Wild Red Heroine" was jointly directed by Chen Kengran, Zheng Yisheng, and Shang Guanwu, and starring Xu Qinfang. It has been approved to be publicly screened at the Central Grand Theater starting on the 30th of this month, and a lively stage play will be added. The grand occasion at that time can be predicted.</p>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater announced that our theater is specialized in showing silent films selected but not yet shown by the Carlton Theater, which is quite popular among general lovers of quiet audiences. The business is developing day by day. A few days ago, because of the screening of the silent tragedy "The Night of the Wedding" starring Jenny Gaynor, in order to seek further improvement, in addition to pre-inviting film celebrity Ren Jinpin to translate the Chinese text for explanation, we also invited the American singer Ms. Manli to sing the song "Grace Tina". The audience was even more crowded. From tomorrow onwards, the Fos Company's fragrant and glamorous film "Mother and Daughter Competing for Love" will be shown, and at the same time, we will invite the Russian singer Ms. Li Qi to sing fragrant and pleasant songs on stage. Last Tuesday, the Russian Opera Troupe performed at the Paris Theater, and although the ticket price was as high as three yuan, the theater was full. However, looking at all kinds of performances, the most popular one was Ms. Li Qi's song and dance. Now our theater, in order to give preferential treatment to the audience, has specially invited Ms. Li Qi to perform on stage for three days, showing her unique skills, but the ticket price will not be increased. It is really a good opportunity for the audience.</p>

<p>Famous Doctor Gao Yingshi Announces: This doctor has long been renowned in Songjiang. Fellow villagers in Shanghai are familiar with my rich experience and have persuaded me to practice medicine in Shanghai. I have now established a clinic at No. 16 Taiyuan Fang, West Zilaihuo Street, French Concession. Consultation fees are waived for the poor and sick.</p>
<p>Chen Jinjie, Specialist in Traumatology from Xinghua, Announces: This doctor's family has resided in Xinghua for generations, and my family has practiced traditional traumatology for over ten generations. My ancestors used surgery and secret medicinal products to save countless lives, earning renown throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. I inherit my ancestors' aspirations and have a heart for helping the world. I have been practicing medicine for over twenty years, meticulously studying and striving for perfection. For all cases of falls, blows, knife and axe injuries, severed tendons, fractured bones, penetrating wounds, unstoppable bleeding, waist and rib pain, palpitations, and stabbing pain in the heart and abdomen, I do not use needles, sutures, massage, or plasters. I treat with plasters, adhesives, elixirs, and powders, and also perform surgery. Pain stops immediately, and the skin, flesh, tendons, and bones self-connect and self-heal. The effects are immediate and verified as miraculous. Now, fellow villagers and relatives in Shanghai have repeatedly invited me to Shanghai to practice medicine and provide universal relief to patients. Please visit No. 1 Guling Road, Public Concession. Time: 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Also selling plasters, adhesives, elixirs, and powders.</p>
