<h3 id="c11">德國之選舉觀 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>德議會解散後。新選舉之競爭。關係德政府前途之命運。故今日各政黨之形勢若何。實亦一大可研究之問題也。現在之政府黨。以中央黨爲中心。而聯合其他各小黨爲助力者也。反對政府黨。則以社會民主黨爲中心。議會中人數。反對黨較政府黨爲多。而現政府之所以能成立者。以中央黨之組織不限於一職業。各種人物。均有加入者。故其黨獨富於彈力性。且可利用其適中之地位時左時右恒爲妥洽之中心。現政府黨雖爲少數黨。而能支撑至今者。恃此而已然中央黨之性質。較傾於右。而其各小與黨。則漸多趨向於左。且社會民主黨。又力與左派各黨聯絡。故此後選舉之形勢。政府方面。不賴中央黨能自身發展而全視其聯結各與黨之能力如何以爲斷。假使各與黨内部而發生變化。則政府實多不利。今據柏林電訊。稱德國民主黨。已於今日正式解散。擬合併於少年德意志圑與國民黨改組一新黨。查民主黨爲政府與黨。在議會中亦占有二十五席。且有十二年之歷史。並非一弱小無能之黨也。又據昨電。稱德國權黨今已分化爲三。在議會中贊助白魯林内閣分子。業與早經脫黨者。成立一保守國民黨夫國權黨向爲中間黨之有能力者。確可舉足重輕。此</p>
<p>次雖未加入白魯林内閣。然亦頗多贊助。今此兩黨變化。固尙未知其至若何程度但若竟向不利於政府方面變化。則實予白氏一大打擊。中央黨領袖。近曾警告社會民主黨。勿再反對白魯林内閣。竊謂選舉競爭。關係不盡在中心之政黨。而其他各與黨。亦操重大權能。殊非警告所能生效也。</p>

<p>中國靑年亞細亞步行圑自出發以來。倐忽匝月矣。其進展情形。果何如乎。想關心徒步旅行事業者。所欲聞也。爰摭拾其所聞見。拉雜誌之。</p>
<p>溯該圑於上月二十八日出發日之下午四時許。忽而傾盆大雨。彼等適至龍華。在天公一若試騐彼等心志堅定與否。在彼等於初發軔之際、受此大雨淋頭。正可淬厲其身手。表示堅决之意志。故仍冒雨前進。晚間露宿莘莊附近之田野。翌早五時開拔。不數日步行抵杭州、因在滬怱怱出發。未及領護照。爰向浙江省政府具呈請領。以便進行調查各地生活之狀况。然浙省政府以爲必須於出發地領護照爲正當手續。以後該圑游踪所至、各省市自當簽字證實。予以保護云。於是該圑推選交際員黃越君星夜返滬。向滬市政府請領護照。越日。果蒙上海市政府准如所請。黃君即負一角公文。返杭報命。向浙省政府要求簽字後。重行前去。蓋黃君曾凂余繕呈文。并怱談數語。始知其有此一番周折也。</p>
<p>頃晤所謂交際博士黃警頑君也者。得覩該圑由寗波所發之覆書。并附出發前各名人題贈之詞。亟錄之。</p>

<h3 id="c172">蘇東坡吃鴉片煙　老·奴· <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>歷代詩人。多是以飲酒出名的。如李太白「斗酒詩百篇」。尤爲人所樂道。蘇東坡的詩名。不下於太白。如赤壁賦。「我有斗酒。藏之久矣」。是蘇東坡的吃酒。與登高能賦的大名。又是人所共知。我現在不說蘇東坡的飲酒賦詩。而說蘇東坡是個隱君子。爲燕子巢的老主顧。豈不是個很大的笑話。然而空說無憑。我却有詩爲證。</p>
<p>『道人勸飲雞蘇水。童子能煎鶯粟湯』。這不是蘇東坡的詩嗎。這不是蘇東坡吃鴉片烟的詩句嗎。</p>
<p>有人說。「這不對。如說鶯粟湯就是現在的鴉片烟。那末「雞蘇水」。亦可說是蘇打所做的汽水了」。我說。「雞蘇水是不是蘇打所作汽水。我不敢指認。但是鴉片烟爲鶯粟花所做成。那郤是無不知的。這就如吃的飯米。是稻禾所舂找而成。論起異名來。有占城玉田種種的别名。而鴉片的譯名。據英人艾約瑟所著鶯粟源流考。大食初名「阿扁」。亞拉伯人讀若「阿芙容」。巴耳西亞人文稱爲「阿片」。至於鴉片在何時傳入中國。史無明文。只有宋開寳四年。大食米廣州。明州（即今寗波）互市。其藥品中。有「米囊花」一種。說明是安心神。增飲食。令人多睡眠之物。後來明神宗在位多年。隱居豹房。絶不臨朝。其所服「延齡丹」。耳談說。「就是鴉片烟的」。但是我在毘耶律中。找出一條確證。律中所載服食方法。即是現在粗製鴉片烟的槍燈。而㽼字尤爲吃烟人的大病。是在佛門中講。病維摩是創始吃雅片烟的第一人。明神父又是以吃鴉片烟出名的皇帝。蘇東坡更是呼童子煎鶯粟湯。雅人深致。名士風流。佳話留傳。大可爲黑籍中人爭一口氣。因爲自來描寫吃烟的人。無不形容如鬼。到了現在。更是觸犯法律。用重刑相督責了。</p>
<p>我還找到一種憑證。林文忠是有絶大烟癮的人。因爲他立志戒烟。所以現在各藥店所售的林文忠藥膏及丸藥。便是以身作則的事實。而四川眉州所出米囊花膏。即是蘇東坡的遺傳。不過米囊花膏與鶯粟湯是不是一物又是如何吃法。恐怕未必就用病維摩所製的竹槍。亦不是明神宗的延齡丹了。</p>
<h3 id="c173">彈子閒話　春·潮· <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>彈子爲球戲之一種。其西名爲Billiard。近頗盛行於國中。以其打法簡凈。富有一種力學上之趣味。智識階級中人旣深好之。普通人亦喜其質樸無文。不似學圍棋先有許多規式須明瞭也。</p>
<p>彈子之打法殊簡單。檯上共置四彈。兩紅兩白。白者名主彈。紅者名賓彈。係兩人共戲。（三四人共戲者雖有。究不甚多）。兩人各認淸一主彈。以後發球。須就此主彈着桿。凡主譂連續觸及他兩彈。即爲得分。觸兩紅一白者爲五分。兩紅者爲三分。一紅一白者爲二分。僅觸一彈者。無分。</p>
<p>普通學習此游戲者。有一個月之努力。毎小時可打得一百六十分與二百分之譜。彼間（彈子房）之部分盤。係以四十分爲一道。故初學者一小時打四五道。並非難事。予前在滬時。曾於大東旅社中見一華人與一西人作此戲。西人曾一桿連續。打</p>
<p>得二百餘分。圍觀者如堵。一小時後。此西人以打滿二十二道獲勝。當時頗詫以爲絶藝。後聞人言。此殊無奇。歐西有每桿能連續打至千餘分者。以此較之。相去尙遠也。</p>
<p>京中近日。彈子房之生涯大盛有華園淮園全安楡園東園等家。内中僅華園佈置尙可。其餘均甚簡陋。檯桿及球彈。均非上品。此外中央飯店靑年會亦有彈子房之附設。各家租資並不廉。毎小時需小銀元四五。而東園則以陳設地點皆落後。雖租値較他家爲少。而顧客亦未見踴躍也。</p>
<p>京市當局前曾舉行一全市彈球比賽。獲錦標者係一邵姓。聞毎小時可打十二道。近淮園彈子房來一茶房。名阿狗。係滬人。與邵角。邵竟不能勝。阿狗須讓以半數。惜其來京稍遲。否則錦標當不致屬邵也、</p>

<p>這時他們很納悶了。左詩晨說。那天確記是在時觀平那裏取來後。向長衫袋裏一塞。長衫拿去洗的時候。不要没有檢出來。他的夫人道。毎次洗衣服。我總在衣袋裏。把所有東西檢出來。給你安放在書桌抽屜裏的。有許多明知是無用之物。也不曾抛棄過。讓你自已去檢點。現在到底是有十張劵咧。怎麽會没有留意。便輕輕的丢棄呢。左詩晨道。尋不着也没有辦法。只好告訴時觀平先生。待找出了以後。再去領獎吧。正在這個時候。左詩晨的一個女孩兒。喚作靑兒的。今年纔只有五歲。說道。我看見爸爸的皮夾子裏。有幾張綠紙頭的。是什麽票子呢。伊的母親問左詩晨。你的皮夾子呢。左詩晨道。皮來子自然好好兒在身邊咧。他夫人道。那末阿靑說你身邊有綠的票子。是不是那個券。你知道那個劵是什麽顔色。左詩晨被伊等一言提醒了。轉了一個念頭。便從身邊掏出那個皮夾子一看。不是十張種福劵。安安穩穩的在皮夾子裏嗎。原來當時觀平交給他的時候。他果然向長衫袋裏一塞。到後來脫了長衫做事。大概他自已本能地恐防遺失。便把衣袋裏的東西。擇要移往皮夾子裏去了。但是自已却只記得第一次的向長衫袋裏一塞。却忘了第二次的由長衫袋称往皮夾子裏。早知如此。到家中來搜尋。也多此一舉。左詩晨不覺自已啞然失笑。眞可以算得庸人自擾了。他夫人道。可不是。自已好好兒藏在皮夾子裏。却回來翻騰了一下子。把人尋得滿頭大汗。還没有發着什麽財。已今敎人的頭腦子昏亂了。可見得那並不是個好東西。左詩晨道。找到了就好咧。要不然。忙亂了一陣子。却依舊没有找到。恰恰那二獎又開在這幾張劵的號頭裏。可不更使人懊喪嗎。這時左詩晨旣找到了種福劵後。便急匆匆的坐了馬車去了。一到了味蒓園。時觀平道。我已調查過了。那二獎的確是在你這十張劵内。左詩晨把十張劵交給時觀平。那十張是個聯號。時觀平數到第三張。便道在這裏了。獎品你可以帶回。他們今天這個陳列所也要撤消。關於種福券的事。我們就可以辦結束了。關於籌賬的事。最討厭的是延宕。因爲大家都有别様職業。這是分出來的工夫。一延宕就往往遲於整理了。</p>

<p>㈩㈤選手之簽字潮</p>
<p>年來日本因特别提倡體育之結果。運動選手之地位陡然增高。各在公司會社毎以能羅致名選手爲榮。待遇極優。面其辦事之能力勿問也。如世界著名之女運動家人見絹技。本年爲大阪毎日新聞聘爲運動記者。月薪日金五百元。終日無所事事。又日本第一流短距離游泳家高石勝男氏。近受三菱公司之聘。任高等職員。類此者不一而足。各界人士基於崇拜英雄之心理。毎以能望見運動選手之顔色爲榮。而婦女爲尤甚。其理想中之丈夫。爲體格魁梧。躍走如飛。在運動界中佔有相當位置者爲最合格。而容貎之妍媸。膚色之黑白勿計也。本屆遠東運動大會自開幕日起至五月三十日止。三國選手無日不受羣衆之包圍。請求簽字。在大會可謂生面别開。在日本即選手簽字潮流正在湍急澎湃之秋。記者嘗詢日本體育界中人。叩以簽字潮之源流。對於精確日期已不可考。第知在去年日德運動會時已有發現。其後此風漸盛。迄於今日。初遠東運動會未開幕之前數日。三國選手合宿於日本靑年館。首由日選手發起。用袖珍小日記本一。遍請中菲選手簽字。以留紀念。未幾我國選手亦起而效法。籃球隊戰將唐寳琨王錫良首請記者簽字。翻閱其小本。則簽名者已有數百。中英日三國文字兼而有之。什襲珍藏。視同拱璧。開幕之後。日本男女學生及小學校學生數十百人。散處各塲入口。及靑年館門前。請求選手簽字。恒有年約十齡左右之小學生。持破碎紙片。擁至選手前。高聲求書。情狀殊堪發噱。五月十六日起。靑年館門前發售大會各種照片。紀念明信片。及紀念扇等。而簽字之風愈熾。紛紛尋求選手本人。簽名於其本身照片中。即大會職員華僑等亦未能免俗。門前萬頭攢動。途爲之塞。均請求簽名之羣衆也。而大名鼎鼎之孫桂雲劉靜貞黃澍芳高梓諸女士更爲一般人所注目。受包圍之次數亦最多。初孫桂雲殊不輕易爲人簽名。某次留學生某君持紀念扇請孫簽字。孫冷顔相向曰。君此種舉動有何意義。某君窘不能答。遂罷。翌日。靑年會幹事張永敬君亦以照片求孫簽名。孫以張久任招待之責。不無微勞。始頷首報可。但謂此實本人之破題兒第一遭云。圍觀者聞言。紛紛請簽。孫在嚴重包圍之下。無法拒絶。遂持筆縱橫大書。一一應酬。片刻之間。簽名不下數十次。亦簽字潮中之趣聞也。於是選手之行動大感因苦。靑年館門前之交通復無法維持。經體恊會幹部討論之下。遂於五月二十八日晨下嚴厲禁上選手簽名之令。復於靑年館門前張貼大字通告。書請求選手簽字絶對不許十字。一時此風雖有稍殺。但在神宮外苑附近。仍續有發現。蓋此種風尙已深印於日人之心腦中。牢不可拔矣。某次記者偕靑年會幹事張永敬君赴日友之招宴。席間招來藝妓十餘。一時粉光花影。燕語鶯啼。曼聲作歌。歡笑滿室。日友善謔。謂記者係中華選手圑短跑健將。張君爲跳高聖手。一聲未已。衆美畢至。張君身高腿長。衆以玉手度量曰。誡者。固跳高天才也。紛出骨扇手帕請我等簽名。一時辯白無術。勉爲塗鴉。衆乃歡然散坐。此情此景。迄今回思。不禁啞然失笑也。</p>

<p>棧單交進八萬包</p>
<p>七月份之標準麫粉、昨爲交割終了之日、各廠實際交割者、計阜豐及裕通之紅藍車共六萬八千包、中華之綠三星四千包、泰隆之綠鷹球八千包、合計八萬包、聞此種棧單之交割、半以客銷不振、現貨湧積可慮、半以抬價太甚、不得不交割也、至收進者、聞係某　客所去、惟北銷停頓、銷通不易、恐往後須吃虧一點也、至期貨之成交額、較六月份减退不少、合計共七百七十四萬一包</p>
<p>千包、列表於后、（單位千）</p>
<p>七月份一二二一　九月份一七五九　十一月份九八八</p>
<p>八月份一七八七　十月份一二六九　十二月份七０七</p>

<p>爲歐戰後最高之價</p>
<p>柏油銷路毎至夏令因燭淘停止專供給皂廠用途、從前吾國未有皂廠時代、夏季本視爲淸淡期間、自有皂廠以來、雖燭淘天熱停製、而油銷頗不寂寞、亦市塲上之變遷史也、近年來皂用日繁、致夏令生意反較盛旺、今庚因上冬年令欠收、産額銳减、入夏後漢滬兩地、洋行辦數甚巨、早呈捉襟露肘之狀態、前日漢電謂皂廠辦麻城油數百擔、價格爲十七兩二錢、申帮辦十七兩、今得函詳、謂荆枝津等均已無貨、惟麻城油已漲至十七兩八錢、而貨亦不多、再辦恐須十八兩外矣、爲歐戰後最高之價格云、</p>
<h3 id="c189">疋頭　長沙止裝後疋市轉靜 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>疋頭交易、昨日復形落靜、實以長江上游各埠、又形不靖、長沙帮來電止裝、漢口·沙市·九江等帮亦觀望不前、故昨日成交不多、本街値淡令、益無生氣、貨價頗受影響、東貨之月華絨已有由漲轉跌之象、細嗶嘰深色汀益軟、棉法絨又小二厘半、妃色楊貴妃已有售一錢七分、鳥美人大紅一錢八分二厘半、一度川帮異常活動之水浪絨、昨亦下落、雙龍爲二錢一分、蕉葉題書二錢零五厘、楊貴妃二錢零七厘半、惟漂布仍挺、天賜黃金九兩一錢、福壽三星九兩五錢半、西皇母十一兩五錢矣、西貨日來呈靑黃不接之狀、夏令貨已告落令、秋令貨一度活潑後、又復見靜故昨無甚交易云、</p>

<p>漳州所産之新蘭竹枝、今庚因收成歉薄、登塲後到貨極少、故前盤曾開至二十九兩、查昨太古公司之濟南輪、由厦入口、共到四百餘箱、其中蘭竹枝約佔半數以上、比前忽增、市價可望略鬆、惟地價仍挺、大約明日可以開盤云、</p>

<p>榨菜來源無繼</p>
<p>雲南大頭菜久無到貨、市上存底頗感稀缺、現市行售四十八元、各行大都已乏貨應市矣、四川榨菜亦以來源阻梗無續到、此間客存僅三千外壜、近日開過三十七元至三十四元、行存更少、大約二千壜、現在走塲尙佳、售價上莊爲三十六元、以次爲三十二元、趨勢穩健、</p>

<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、仍無漲勢、緣里昻各絲織廠、現正力圖减輕成本、絲價不高、電轉價小、歐莊亦望廉價囤積、成交難暢、昨祗信孚等進滬白廠經三十包、逹昌進白乾經十包、價均堅穩云、</p>

<p>米蘭市塲、自新絲上市後、歐美銷胃均無起色、絲價逐步下降、邇因全國發生震災、秋蠶完全無望、義絲漸見轉漲、雙特號法銷稍動、價漲三利拉、特號漲兩利拉云、</p>

<p>昨日本埠茶市、美莊銷路、頗有活動之趨勢、錦隆怡和等行及華茶公司、均已開辦、惟銀價見低二三兩、路莊大帮、亦有數帮、正在談判中、貢熙綠茶俄國恊助會及白頭莊均有大批進胃、交易尙不寂寞、針眉秀眉等項、怡和協和等行亦需求甚殷、上述綠茶、均不難於銷售、獨珍眉一項、市面依然不振、近來囤積、目見豐厚、頗爲一般茶商所隱憂云、</p>

<p>本廠元釘、在先河南·山西諸區、生意十分興旺、市塲之談判訉、幾無日無之、最近因戰事恍惚、該帮等殊無問津、市面極感冷落、而漢口内地諸帮、亦因底盤太昻、不能合算、故成交鮮少、大有寥若晨星之概刻市售價毎桶六兩一錢半倍司據全申經銷之各同業調查、目下毎日銷路祗有二百七八十桶之譜、如此景况、實爲本廠釘之冷落時代也、</p>

<h3 id="c279">最近的土耳其文壇　明· <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>因爲土耳其底共和國政府、努力於民族的再造的緣故、逐漸喚醒了許多潛伏已久的活動、所以土耳其底文學不久也要大爲活動起來、是意料中之事、在目前呢、這一方面的努力還是很平庸的、不過這様的努力、倒可以說是更好的收穫底嚆矢、像土耳其那様的國家、决不會産生不出良好的文學來、是可以斷言的、處於近東的這古老的國家、是有着美妙的富於戲劇味的歷史背景、其中播滿着色彩丰富的傳說和民間文學、這些正是優美的民族文學底資料、雖然土耳其人現在還是不看重他們的民間文學底寳藏</p>
<p>不過土耳其文學之不能發逹、亦是有其原由、因爲土耳其要使她的文學興盛、必須先解决那個很重大的不識字間題目前土耳其有五百萬不能讀書不能寫字的人、現在政府所施行的普及敎育運動、毎年使五十萬個成人受些基礎的敎育、但就是照這數目算起來、這巨大的「識字運動」的工程也非十年不能完成、</p>
<p>土耳其自從在一年多以前、採用了拉丁字母之後、用新法拚音的書、一共印出了一千多種、其中有百分之八十都是學校敎本、此外、文學方面的、有四十種長篇小說、三十種兒童故事集、十五種詩集、至於作家底數目、雖然說是自從廢除了亞拉伯字以後、已經增多起來、但是因爲新法拚音書的銷路困難、他們都是找不到出版家、譬如、就長篇小說來說、舊式文字的、銷路就已經不好、毎種的印數大概是從二百本到二千本、但是銷數能夠超過五百本的就很少很少了、萊沙特、諾里（ＲeshadNouri)所著的「鷦鷯」、是土耳其底一本、</p>
<h3 id="c280">銷路最好的書 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>自從在少年前初次出版、一直到現在共約售出了二萬五千册、但是這本書始終没有改用新體字重印、因爲用新體字重印、銷路就要没有了、</p>
<p>因此、在作家方面、曾屢次要求政府發給一些津貼、來鼓勵新文學底建設、但政府總是不答應、不過、土耳其底敎育部最近已經和法國哈楷忒書店接洽、答應在第一年由政府給以經濟上的扶助、假使這書店能在土耳其各地添設售賣書籍雜誌報紙的經理處、這計劃底目的就是要擴大書籍底銷路、因爲在目前、土耳其底讀書界完全是集中在大城市裏、土耳其底書有百分之八十是由那四大都會吸收的、依司單部爾（Istanbul)佔百分之三十、安哥拉(Angola)佔百分之二十五、斯密爾那(Smyina)佔百分之二十、沙姆生(Samsun)佔百分之十、其餘的百分之二十分散在三個小都市、</p>
<p>書業底生意一大半仍舊是在於那些用亞拉伯字印的書、這種書底存貨到現在還有、至於新體字的書、銷路實在不大、因爲老一輩的人、拿讀書來做做消遣的、寗願看那種老式的字、祗有那些學生們、才看得慣新體字的書、不過、一本新的土耳其字典、新近已經出版了、裏面容納三萬個拉丁字母拚音的新體字、這本字典當然是很有用處的、</p>
<p>因爲識字的人少、土耳其底文化程度向來是不普及的、所以土耳其底出版事業向來是不發逹書舖裏是充滿了灰塵滿佈的小册子、這些小册子都是用一種膠板複寫器的方法印出來、毎頁挿着用筆畫的工筆畫、彷彿波斯的小幅宗敎畫、而且因爲紙少的原故、用紙非常經濟、毎册密納不完的正文都斜寫在毎頁底邊上、弄得一本書上的字、亂七八糟、眉目不淸、這些書都是用的軟紙面裝訂、毎本約賣一兩角錢、土耳其所有的舊式小說、就都是印成這麽様的東西、而且這些小說又多是家喩户曉、差不多背都背得出的像「行吟詩人」、「沙依司梅」(SbabIsmaiI)「行吟詩人猶默」(EumertbeMinatrel)「久洛喬」(Kiucogion)「列娜與梅得龍」(LeyIaandMedjooun)、「基倫與阿司利」(keremandAsli)等都是、這些書在土耳其的地位、正和「筆生花」「再生緣」「征東」「征西」「玉蜻蜓」「雙珠鳳」在我們中國一様、</p>
<p>但是這種傳統的文學現在是勢力大衰了、和在過去幾年裏所出的那些新式小說比較起來、銷數是相差不少、不過、這些新式小說大多是模倣歐洲纞愛小說的作品、結構平凡、内容膚淺、都没有什麽文學價値、而且這些小說往往在報紙上逐日刋載、所以都是拖沓冗長、味同嚼蠟、這倒又是我們的報紙小說相像的、</p>

<p>中並没有特出的人物、胡珊拉迷（HusseinＲahmi)、哈珊、地默爾(HassanDjemal)、萊沙特諾里、都有一部份的讀者、勢力不相上下、土耳其小說之被譯成外國文字的、至今祇有「鷦鷯」、曾被譯成德文、萊沙特諾里（「鷦鷯」底作者）底受人歡迎全在乎他那單純的風格、樸質自然、没有波斯式亞拉伯的影響底痕迹、確是自成一格的、</p>

<p>在近東、現代的浪漫小說是代替了古老的神秘文學了、那努力於保存古代名僧隱士底哲學文和詩歌的、只有那一班學者們、因爲這些東西是已經成爲古董了、至於土耳其讀書界底趣味那是只要看了一件事情就可以測度出來、在土耳其底外國文學譯本之中、最爲風行的就是左拉底「忠實」（Ｖerjte）、而「忠實」者、固是非常「浪漫肉感」的小說也、</p>
<p>許多西洋的文學名著都已經用新字母譯成出來、因爲歐洲文學、在土耳其很有一部份人歡迎、而且、這實在是一件可以贊美的事情、因爲歐洲文學底介紹、無疑地是會在土耳其文壇引起良好的影響的、至於土耳其底民間故衙呢、因爲代代相傳、已經有好幾百年了、所以很少有印成書的、就是有、也不過印成像上面所說的那種小册子、奈司哀特丁考耶（NaseddirlKbodja）、帖木兒大帝時代的滑稽之士、是比别的民間傳說中的人幸運、新近出版了一本叙述他一生事蹟效、八十頁的小册子、溯叙他的兒童時代、學生時代、少年時代、做法官的時代和衰老的時代、去年、土耳其有一家書店、因新字母印行了一本書、專載的這位滑稽寓言家底故事、不過傳說中的他的故事、實在太多了、這只是其中的很小一部份吧了、</p>

<p>中還有一位很熟的人物、卡拉高支（Karagoz)、關於他的傳說、亦將用同様的方式被保存起來、做這工作的是勞伯脫大學底西林貝(SelimBey)敎授、這位著名人物底故事、除了被寫成傀儡戲底脚本之外、向來是没有見諸印行的、只有一位德國的東方學者、刻特博士(DoctorＲettor)、在幾年之前、曾經出版過一册精印挿圖的書、裏面搜羅了幾篇以卡拉高支爲故事中心的傀儡劇脚本、但那並不是純粹的「卡拉高支故事」、西林貝底目的就是要將民間傳說的卡拉高支底故事不加修飾地記錄下來、所以要算是土耳其民俗學中的一件重要工作、只可惜編者爲了要便於流行起見、竭力地要肅淸這</p>

<h3 id="c286">掛枝兒　李·替·華· <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>我曾說過白雪遺音續選是很好的民間歌曲、現在我所要談的這本「掛枝兒」正也是有同様地價値的一本、</p>
<p>「持枝兒」包含了四十一首民間情歌、據說是明崇禎時的一個放浪不覊的才士馮猶龍所作、不過、對於作者究竟是誰、有些人覺得這還是一個疑問、鄭振鐸曾舉出沈德符的顧曲雜言的一叚紀載、來証明掛枝兒並非馮氏的創作、而實爲民間流行的歌曲之一、沈德符的顧曲雜言中說、</p>
<p>嘉隆間乃興閳五更：銀絞絲之屬、自兩淮以至江南、漸與詞曲相遠、不過寫淫媟情態、略具抑揚而已、比年以來、又有打棗乾、掛枝兒二曲、其腔調約略相似、則不問南北、不問男女、不問老幼良賤、人人習之、亦人人喜聽之、以至刋布成帙、舉世傳誦、沁人心腑、其譜不知從何來、眞可駭歎、：：：</p>
<p>從這裏看來、馮氏創作之說似乎便難於成立、而且從另一方面看來、馮猶龍本是一位喜歡訂正他人的作品的人、如「量江記」、「一捧雪」（改名「風流夢」）、合爲墨憨齋傳奇十餘種、又增加「平妖傳」及其他小說、如「智囊」、「情史」、「醒世恒言」、「警世通言」、「喩世明言」等書、都曾爲校訂改編、至於掛枝兒裏面的四十一首情歌、他那綺麗美好、自然不是那純粹的民間歌曲所能比得上、顯然地正是經過了文人手裏修飾過的、因此、我們說掛枝兒本是民間的歌曲、經馮氏彙集、而加以修改與潤色的、到比較來得令人相信些、</p>
<p>「掛枝兒」與「白雪遺音續選」雖同是歌唱男男女女的事、但是「掛枝兒」對於性慾及親嘴擁抱之類的描寫、却比「白雪遺音續選」來得含蓄蘊藉、如本書比較直率的調情、寫來也並不粗野、</p>
<p>嬌滴滴玉人兒我十分在意、恨不得一碗水呑你到肚裏、日日想、日日掛、終須不濟、大着胆上前親個嘴、謝天謝地、他也不推辭、早知你不推辭也、何待今日方如此、</p>
<p>調情（一）</p>
<p>這與「白雪遺音續選」中的「情人愛我」、「玉美人兒」、「喜只喜的」等首比較、自然要算是曲折細膩得多了、至於「恨不得一口水呑你到肚裏」、這倒是一句純粹的民間歌曲、流行很廣的、我記得曾聽過一支這様的曲子、</p>
<p>奴家喲、奴家喲、生小好似個醜豬婆、半夜呀五更裏睡也睡不着、想起了、白天哪、俏郎君打從門前過、門前過、一口冷水呑下了肚皮　、</p>
<p>至於這支曲子以後是不是也曾和調情似的大着胆子上前親了個嘴、那我可惜不曾把他聽完但是、我總覺得有許多民間歌曲是這様同類似的、而且、越是流行得廣的民間歌曲、越是各地不同、可是、這種不同、並非主旨完全不同、不過、因爲各地習俗方言的關係、改頭換面的大同小異罷了、我們把這本「掛枝兒」和「白雪遺音續選」來比較研究、便發見了有幾首是相同的、顯然地可以看出來他本是同出一源而來的、試舉出如下、</p>
<p>俏娘兒指定了杜康駡、你因俏造下酒、醉倒我寃家、進門來一交跌在奴懷下、那管人瞧見、幸遇我丈夫不在家、好色貪盃的寃家也、把性命當做耍、</p>
<p>｜駡杜康（掛枝兒）</p>
<p>恨將起來把杜康駡、造下了美酒醉壞了寃家、醉得他胡言亂語將奴駡站不住一頭撞在奴懷下、喜我的兒夫無有在家、若在家、這個亂子比天還大、呌情人、打個燈籠回去罷、</p>
<p>｜恨將起來（白雪遺音續選）</p>
<p>瓜國仁兒本不是希奇貨、汗巾兒包裏了送與我親哥、一個個都在我舌尖上過、禮輕人義重、好物不須多、多拜上我的親哥也、休要忘了我、</p>
<p>｜贈瓜子（掛枝兒）</p>
<p>瓜子仁本不是希奇之貨、紙包兒汗巾裏、送你奴情哥、好的不用多、一顆敵一顆、一顆都在奴的舌尖上過、勸情哥吃下去、切莫忘懷了我、切莫忘懷了我、</p>
<p>｜瓜子仁）白雪遺音續選（</p>
<p>所以、我們研究民間歌曲、倘能努力去採集各地大同小異的來比較研究、定能增加不少的興味、更多的新的發見、而且、可以看出它們的本來面目、不過、採集民間歌曲的人、有許多依然只知在許多大同小異的歌曲中選出一兩首比較好一點的、便認爲滿意罷了、其餘的便棄如敝屣了、不去過問了、這様、對於民間歌曲是不會有好的成績的、更進一層言、民間的歌謡故事之類的採集、也未始没有這個毛病、我希望努力民間文學的人、認淸這一點、</p>
<p>「掛枝兒」的詠物曲、比較「白雪遺音續選」來得多、在四十一首歌曲中、竟有「荷珠」·「粽子」·「鏡子」·「金針」·「裹脚兒」·「帳鈎」·「簫」七首、可是首首都包含着細膩曲折的雙關意思、極爲有趣、例如｜</p>
<p>露水荷珠珍葉兒現是奴家痴心腸把線來穿、誰知你水性兒多更變、這邊分散了又向那邊圓没眞性的寃家也、隨着風兒轉、</p>
<p>這種以詠物來發抒自已的情感、是何等自然、是何等動人、我們再看他在字眼中用隱比法的這首金針、</p>
<p>金針兒、我愛你眞心眞意、望得你眼兒穿、你怎得知、偶相縫、怎忍和你相抛棄、我時常來挑逗你、勿你心膽是鐵打的、</p>
<p>倘一線的相通也、不枉了磨弄你、</p>
<p>這種以「針」隱「眞」、以「縫」隱「逢」的玩意兒、在中國一向本是很盛行的、譬如古詩中以「芙蓉」隱「夫容」、以「蓮」隱「憐」、以「絲」隱「思」以「碑」隱「悲」之類的例很多、此外如劉禹錫的竹枝詞中的「東邊日出西邊雨、道是無晴却有晴」、這個「晴」便是隱「情」、至於歌曲歌謡之中、用隱比的尤多、如粤東俗歌中的、「雨後蜘蛛還結網、想晴惟有暗中思」、「晴」隱「情」、「絲」隱「思」、就是一個很好的例子、總之、這種比隱法、總不外乎以事物的借喩或字音的相同來托出内心的情態、</p>
<p>末了、我覺得民間文學、是民族思想的結晶、是民族共同的心音的流露、他表現了這一民族的特性及其民族精神、同時、使我們可以看出他的長處與短處所在、而在改造、啓發·指引·和扶助他們、使他們日登輝煌燦爛的境域、</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the Changsha Incident, the Japanese Foreign Ministry held a meeting with all top officials for three hours starting at 2 PM yesterday. The Japanese government's view is that it is necessary to await detailed clarification of the incident before lodging a protest and demanding compensation. Regarding the burning of the consulate, the consulates of the United Kingdom and the United States seem to have suffered the same fate, and a common approach will be adopted with the British and American governments. After the meeting, Parliamentary Vice-Minister Nagai told reporters that Consul-General Okada from Jian Dao reported that after protecting the Koreans in Manchuria, the Changsha Incident would be discussed. No detailed report on the burning of the consulate has yet been received, and it is not possible to state a definite attitude at this time. However, it is regrettable that the lives and property of residents were not adequately protected. However, since the other party is the communist army, the Nanjing army has no means to intervene, so this issue is extremely complicated. Regarding the protection of Japanese residents, Commander of the First Overseas Dispatch Fleet, Minei, is taking all appropriate measures. (31st Electric News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Germany's View of Elections <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>After the dissolution of the German Parliament, the competition in the new election concerns the fate of the German government. Therefore, the current situation of the various political parties is a major issue that can be studied. The current ruling party is centered around the Centre Party, which unites with other smaller parties for support. The opposition party is centered around the Social Democratic Party. In Parliament, the opposition party has more members than the ruling party. The reason why the current government can be established is that the Centre Party's organization is not limited to one profession, and people from all walks of life can join. Therefore, the party is uniquely resilient and can use its moderate position to constantly be the center of compromise by leaning left or right as needed. Although the current ruling party is a minority party, it has been able to sustain itself until now by relying on this. However, the nature of the Centre Party leans more to the right, and its smaller parties are gradually leaning more to the left. Moreover, the Social Democratic Party is also striving to unite with various left-wing parties. Therefore, the future election situation for the government depends entirely on the Centre Party's ability to develop itself and how well it can connect with various other parties. If changes occur within the other parties, it will be very unfavorable for the government. According to Berlin telecommunications, the German Democratic Party officially dissolved today and plans to merge with the Young German League and the Nationalist Party to reorganize a new party. The Democratic Party is a ruling party and occupies 25 seats in Parliament. It also has a history of twelve years and is not a weak and incapable party. According to yesterday's telecommunications, the German National Party has now split into three. Members of Parliament who support the Brüning cabinet have formed a Conservative National Party with those who had already left the party. The National Party has always been a capable centrist party that can make a difference. Although it did not join the Brüning cabinet this time, it still provided a lot of support. The changes in these two parties are still unknown to what extent, but if they turn unfavorable to the government, it will be a major blow to Brüning. The leader of the Centre Party recently warned the Social Democratic Party not to oppose the Brüning cabinet again. I think that the competition in the election is not entirely related to the central political party, and other parties also have significant powers, which warnings cannot effectively influence.</p>

Guo Taiqi does not need to go. The decision for Jia and Xue to go was made by Yan and Feng first. Guo's trip was proposed after I arrived in Tianjin and was originally a general visit. I have stated that the Kuomintang does not deny the existence of other political parties, but it has not cancelled the meaning of party rule. During the period of political tutelage, party rule still applies. Government officials must be deeply aware of the party before they can be appointed. At this time, if we suddenly recognize the unrestricted activities of enemy parties that violate the Three Principles of the People, it would fundamentally violate the first article of the founding program. The statement that there are no parties outside the party was fabricated by a few people and is not the Prime Minister's will. (31st)</p>

<p>National News Agency, Ottawa, 30th: After this election, the Canadian Conservative Party has returned to power. According to Mr. Bennett, the leader of the party, in an interview with the United Press today, the party's advocacy of raising tariffs is actually to emulate the high tariff policy of the United States and is not a means of retaliation. Mr. Bennett also described the party's three major policies as follows: (1) To modify the tariffs to prevent the previous outflow of six million yuan worth of goods imported from the United States and replace them with domestic products. (2) To promote domestic commerce through different domestic and foreign tariffs. (3) To abolish the method of equalizing tariffs. According to the Conservative Party's longstanding advocacy of imperialism, judging from Mr. Bennett's attitude, the party will continue to maintain this doctrine.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Members of the British Far East Inspection Group Have Now Been Finalized <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 30th: The members of the Far East Economic Inspection Group have now been finalized, with Thompson as chairman and director of the cotton industry division. He is the chairman of the British Cotton Industry Combined Executive Committee. The mission of this group is to investigate the current state of British trade with China and Japan and to report on what aspects should be adopted to promote trade with China and Japan. The cotton industry division is composed of seven people related to the cotton industry, and their task is to assist the economic group in investigating the cotton industry and to report on the methods to expand the sales of British cotton goods. The Under-Secretary of the Overseas Trade Department, Gillett, said today that the economic group's visit to Japan is partly in response to the Japanese inspection group's visit to Britain as a gesture of friendship. After visiting Japan, they will go to China and visit Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, North China, and Guangzhou, spending several months in China. The group members include representatives from the cotton, woolen, steel, and iron industries, and the nature is cooperative. Lancashire is currently raising 6,000 pounds to fund the cotton industry division. Although the situation in China is unstable, its import trade is increasing year by year. Britain has failed to occupy a considerable position in this advance, so the main task of this group is to suggest remedies.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Bombay, 30th: The Northwest Frontier of India remains unsettled. Seventy British army aircraft are still preparing to be dispatched to bomb the villages and fortresses of the local tribes at any time. According to news from Simla, the Governor-General of India may issue a special order allowing the two Nehru brothers, leaders of the National Congress in the Allahabad prison, to meet with Gandhi in the Pune prison to persuade him to order the cessation of non-violent resistance and the boycott of British goods, or to go to London in person, or to send representatives to attend the Round Table Conference. However, members of the National Congress say that even if the Nehru brothers can meet with Gandhi, they may not be able to sincerely persuade him.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Paris, 30th: The former King of Egypt, Hilmi, who was forced to abdicate by the British during the European War, told a visiting journalist that he did not believe that the British army could contain the current national movement in Egypt.

<h3 id="e50">Dissolution of the German Democratic Party <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 30th: The German Democratic Party officially dissolved today and joined the newly organized State Party. The party was founded twelve years ago. In recent years, although it still has the support of several major newspapers, such as the Berliner Tageblatt, the Vossische Zeitung, and the Frankfurter Zeitung, and the support of the middle class, especially intellectuals, its influence in the country has gradually declined. The party, advocating liberalism, is loosely organized and does not have the rigorous organization of the left and right parties. Therefore, it cannot compete with them on the political stage. In addition, young people after the war are immersed in radicalism and want a more active and enterprising policy, and do not much approve of liberalism. Therefore, the party is gradually entering a state of decline. Therefore, two-thirds of the four hundred executive committee members today approved the dissolution, with only four opposing it. However, whether it can fully increase its strength in the parliament and become a major political party after merging with the Young German League still depends on how many members of the National Party join. In addition, the name of the new party also caused problems today. A clothing store owner, driven by patriotic enthusiasm two years ago, organized a club called the National Party and registered it with the government. Therefore, he has protested today against the Democratic Party and the Young German League for plagiarizing the party name, filed a lawsuit in court, and refused the Democratic Party's offer to buy the party name.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Ankara, 30th: The Persian government has protested to the Turkish government because Turkish soldiers recently pursued the Kurdish rebels and crossed the border into Persian territory, demanding compensation for the losses. However, the Turkish political circles are quite displeased with this action by the Persians, believing that the Persian authorities allowed the Kurdish rebels to obtain supplies and reinforcements in Persian territory, which necessitated the Turkish army's pursuit across the border. However, the Turkish army immediately returned to Turkish territory after the event. In consideration of the long-standing friendship between the two countries, the Turkish government did not protest, but the Persians have taken this action. Therefore, it is reported that the Turkish government will reply in strong terms.</p>

<p>National News Agency, London, 30th: According to the latest news, the R100 airship is progressing very smoothly. Its current speed has reached 110 kilometers per hour, and everything in the ship is safe and sound. The weather near the Canadian coast is also good.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 30th: Commander Lusenthal of the US Navy airship Los Angeles set off today for Montreal, Canada, to welcome the British airship R100, which is making a transatlantic voyage. According to Lusenthal, the United States can use the results of this voyage of the British airship as design data for building a new large airship for the US Navy, because 30% of the engineering of the large airship still needs to be improved. The public here is paying extraordinary attention to this voyage of the R100, and the newspapers are also doing their best to publicize it.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Montreal, 3rd: According to the radio news from the Empress of France today, the British airship R100 was sighted at 2:06 PM today in the sky 22 miles east of the Strait of Belle Isle.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Montreal, 30th: A radio message from the British R100 airship states that the ship has reached 55 degrees north latitude and 53.30 degrees west longitude, with a speed of 50 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Reuters, Montreal, 30th: According to the telemetry from the R100 airship, the airship can arrive here at 3:00 PM before Thursday. Later, another telegram stated that it has arrived in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Strait of Belle Isle can see Canadian land at 9:00 PM tonight.

In the afternoon, Prime Minister MacDonald briefly stated the agenda of the Imperial Conference in the House of Commons, saying that the most important matters to be handled by the conference are: first, the relationship between the various parts of the Empire; second, foreign affairs and national defense, including peacetime arbitration and arms limitation; and third, economic issues, such as tariff collections, purchase price standardization, revitalizing intra-imperial trade, agricultural research, and transportation.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 31st: The investigation and research on the military system reform have been mostly completed, and the final plan will be decided soon. If the number of divisions is reduced according to this plan, it is necessary to avoid simply streamlining the content by the following methods: (1) Each infantry regiment, originally scheduled for three battalions, will abolish one battalion, and a machine gun team will be established to replace it. In total, 70 companies can be reduced. (2) Abolish eight cavalry companies and establish cavalry regiments with four to eight machine guns. (3) The artillery will remain largely the same. (4) Reduce 17 ordinary soldier teams and increase 3 special engineering teams. (5) Reduce 14 transport teams. (6) Maintain the status quo of the air force. If there is餘裕 in the expenses of other arms, it must be used in this area. This plan can be completed within three months, and a portion of it can be incorporated into the 6th year budget. However, even so, it cannot save 10 million yuan.</p>

<p>(Communication from the China Branch of the International Labour Office)</p>
<p>The 14th International Labour Conference closed on June 29th this year. At this conference, two draft conventions were resolved: one on the abolition of forced labour and the other on working hours for shop assistants. The draft convention on working hours for coal miners failed to pass due to a three-vote difference and was changed to be discussed at the next conference. In addition to the draft conventions, four recommendations were passed:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding working hours in hotels and restaurants;</p>
<p>(2) Regarding working hours in entertainment venues;</p>
<p>(3) Regarding working hours in hospitals and poorhouses;</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the elimination of indirect forced labour.</p>
<p>In addition to the draft conventions and recommendations, several proposals were passed. However, the proposal by the Indian workers' representative to convene a special Asian labour conference did not pass because it did not reach the required number of votes. The proposal by the Japanese representative to request the Governing Body of the International Labour Office to include the issue of workers' freedom of association on the agenda of the next Labour Conference was passed. This issue was discussed once three years ago, but it did not yield any results due to intense debate. It is expected that there will still be a fierce debate next time. The two draft conventions passed by this conference are summarized below:</p>
<p>(1) Draft Convention on the Abolition of Forced Labour: Any country that ratifies this draft convention must prohibit various forms of forced labour in the shortest possible time. However, during the transitional period, forced labour is only allowed for public works. Five years after the implementation of this convention, the Governing Body of the International Labour Office shall find ways to prohibit various forms of forced labour without further delay. The competent authorities shall not allow private individuals, private associations, or companies to carry out forced labour for profit. Any forced labour that already exists for private purposes shall be prohibited from the date of implementation of this draft convention. During the transitional period, if the competent authorities wish to carry out forced labour within the scope of this convention, the following conditions must be met: first, the work to be carried out must be of direct and significant benefit to the group of people being forced; second, the work must be an urgent need; and third, it must be impossible to find voluntary workers. The local chiefs exercising administrative power who impose forced labour on the local people in lieu of all public taxes shall be gradually prohibited. Only men between the ages of 18 and 45 may be subjected to forced labour, but those who are physically unfit or have duties in administration and education are not included. The time each person is subjected to forced labour shall not exceed 60 days within 12 months. Working hours, wages, and workers' compensation shall be the same as those of ordinary workers. Except in special circumstances, workers subjected to forced labour shall not be moved from their habitual residential area to other places where the living conditions are very different. All kinds of health and safety protection shall be provided during forced labour. Every year, when a country that has ratified the draft convention submits a report to the International Labour Office, it must describe the situation of forced labour in each of its regions in a very detailed manner. The competent authorities shall promulgate a law governing forced labour and grant the right of appeal to those subjected to forced labour. Illegal forced labour shall be punished by criminal law.</p>
<p>(2) Draft Convention on Working Hours for Shop Assistants and Clerical Employees: This draft convention applies to various shops, postal, telegraph, and telephone services, as well as clerical employees in administrative agencies and shops or factories of mixed industrial and commercial nature. The competent authorities may not comply with this convention in the following circumstances: (1) all the workers in various shops and factories are members of the same family; (2) all the workers are related to national administration. Shop assistants and clerical employees within the scope of the convention shall work only 48 hours per week and 8 hours per day, except in exceptional circumstances. If calculated on a weekly basis, the maximum per day shall not exceed 10 hours. In the event of an accident or during the holidays, working hours may be increased to make up for the lost hours, but not more than 30 days per year and not more than one hour per day. The competent authorities implementing this draft convention must adopt an inspection system and must order the relevant employers to make various reports and records. Those who violate the law and exceed the working hours shall be punished.</p>

<h3 id="e63">The Central Propaganda Department Receives News Reporters <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a talk with news reporters at 2:00 PM on the 31st in the Central Second Conference Hall. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Liu Luyin chaired the meeting and reported that Wang Jingwei had to go to the north to seek a way out because Zhang Fakui's failure in Hunan and Li Bai's remnants were few. Unexpectedly, after Wang arrived in the north, he was despised by Yan. When Wang arrived in Tianjin, Yan was in Tianjin but refused to see Wang. Therefore, Wang was snubbed by Yan once after arriving in Tianjin. After Wang arrived in Beiping, except for meeting with Xie and Zou, there was a rare scene of deserted carriages at the door. Wang has no research on foreign studies and only knows how to write poetry. He can usually express sympathy to others in conversations, so most people consider Wang to be lovely. Since Wang arrived in Beiping, those who loved Wang generally thought that Wang was hopeless, and even those who had no grudges against Wang felt it was a pity. However, those who usually praised Wang and those who hated Wang all hoped that Wang would arrive in Beiping, because those who praised Wang hoped that they could relieve themselves by ridicule after Wang arrived in Beiping, and those who hated Wang hoped that Wang would be disgraced after Wang arrived in Beiping. The rest who had historical relations with Wang all hoped that he would not defame the past revolutionary history, but Wang had lost all of his past history since arriving in Beiping. The reason is that Wang has no主見. For example, after arriving in Beiping, he initially advocated ruling the country with the party and losing democratic forces, but soon changed his tune and held secret meetings, deciding to strictly stop the activities of the reorganized faction's lower levels, that is, the mass movement, which cannot be restored immediately. Although there is a plan to convene a national conference recently, it is believed that it will soon change. Therefore, Wang's only magic weapon after arriving in Beiping is to call for the support of democratic forces on the one hand, and to prohibit lower-level activities on the other hand. As for the various political claims made by Wang recently, several points are noteworthy. First, he advocates not having political tutelage and formulating a constitutional law or an empty text equal to the constitutional law. Second, he wants to please Feng and Yan, advocating the withdrawal of some troops, nominally to defend Beiping, but in reality to threaten the Northeast with troops. Third, because the Beiping warlords do not like the Communist Party, he advocates strictly preventing the Communist Party and stopping the class struggle. We deeply know that he has no true and immovable主見, so these claims will soon change. For example, Wang told Yan and Feng that it is necessary to strictly prevent the Communist Party, while secretly ordering the leaders of the Communist Party in the south to carry out the planned work of killing and arson as originally planned. Therefore, Changsha has suffered another焚殺浩刦 recently. Today, a telegram was received stating that the central army had recaptured Changsha on the 29th of this month, and the Communist Party's arson and robbery lasted for 30 hours, causing extremely heavy losses. This shows that Wang still uses the Communist bandits as his soul, still wants to satisfy his desire for leadership, and on the other hand, is doing the dirty work of selling the party today and selling the faction tomorrow. If this continues, not only will he be despised by Yan, but the reorganized faction will also be disadvantageous to him. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Wuhan Intensifies Martial Law <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Wuhan is located in a vital area with a large and complex population. There are many petty criminals everywhere. Recently, due to the rampant banditry in various counties, many people have come to the province to seek refuge, with the number reaching 700,000. As a result, bandits have also followed one after another. The authorities have taken strict precautions and have not succeeded. In recent days, banditry has resurfaced in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, and rumors have spread for a time, presenting a terrifying scene. Today (July 30), the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters held another meeting on the issue of maintaining public security. That evening, the Garrison Headquarters immediately ordered martial law and also strengthened the deployment of military police, which was more comprehensive than before. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Communist Conspiracy: Since Commander Xia Douyin left Hankou, the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters has been responsible by Chief of Staff Ye Peng. Ye is a capable person who has long known that the Communist Party is plotting an uprising. He has specially instructed the investigation team to conduct strict investigations. He has successively uncovered several secret Communist Party organizations, captured many members of the Communist Party, and seized many secret documents. At this point, the Communist Party's conspiracy has been completely exposed. The Garrison Headquarters has paid special attention, and the defenses near Yiyuan have been particularly strict in recent days.</p>
<p>Headquarters Meeting: When Commander-in-Chief He Yingqin returned to Hankou from Henan on the 22nd, he convened various military and political figures for a meeting at the headquarters. He reported on the spot that he was about to depart to supervise the troops. The issue of Wuhan's public security was raised for discussion, and a solution had already been decided. Now, due to the increasing rumors, Qian Dajun, commander of the 3rd Training Division, He Guoguang, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Liu Wendao, Mayor of Hankou, and Ye Peng, Chief of Staff of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, went to see He on the 30th for another meeting, which lasted for a long time. As a result, it was decided to strictly prevent and control by zone, with the Garrison Headquarters taking overall responsibility, so as to achieve unified command.</p>
<p>Martial Law Situation: The three towns of Wuhan were initially under invisible martial law. However, due to the hot weather, there were still many pedestrians even late at night. The commanders of the various martial law zones only secretly guarded against incidents. Martial law was not implemented until after 9:00 PM on the 30th. There were very few pedestrians. After 12:00 AM, it was even more strict. Pedestrians could not pass without a password. Those with passwords still had to be questioned or their credentials checked. Visitors to theaters and parks left early, and the liveliness of a few days ago was no longer there.</p>
<p>Execution of Communists: The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters recently received a report from the Wuchang Public Security Bureau that they had arrested six members of the Communist Party: Li Huirong (also known as Chen Kang, from Changsha), Wang Wending (also known as Wang Ziqing, from Huangmei), He Shi (from Huangmei), Li Shusheng (also known as Li Bailin, from Huanggang), Liu Yingsheng (also known as Liu Jingchen, from Huanggang), and Zhou Haiming (also known as Zhou Zixian, from Huanggang). After strict interrogation by the Headquarters, it was found that they were all engaged in important Communist Party work. They were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad today (July 30).</p>
<h3 id="e66">Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Cleans Up the Guangzhou Branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: After the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank went bankrupt, the Public Security Bureau sent Section Chief Ling of the Administrative Section to take inventory of the deposits and seal them up. Recently, in order to expedite the clearing of deposits, the creditors planned to entrust the General Chamber of Commerce to handle the matter, which would facilitate the process. The General Chamber of Commerce has always had the habit of resolving commercial debt disputes. On the afternoon of the 26th, at 3:00 PM, the General Chamber of Commerce convened the creditors at its premises to discuss the clearing procedures of the bank and, in order to verify the bank's claims, requested the creditors present to list the amounts deposited in the bank one by one in order to report statistics for the purpose of clearing and distribution. On that day, more than 100 creditors of the bank arrived to sign in and list the outstanding debts until the meeting began at 3:00 PM. Representative Hu of the General Chamber of Commerce presided over the meeting. First, Hu reported, in brief, that the General Chamber of Commerce should assume the responsibility of clearing the debts at the request of the creditors after the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank went bankrupt. As for the procedures for receiving and handling the matter, it is necessary to first determine the procedures and then proceed accordingly. However, the procedures for handling the matter should be decided by the creditors, and the General Chamber of Commerce can only implement them. Today, creditors are convened to discuss the main points and decide on the procedures for handling the matter. After discussion among the creditors, they unanimously agreed that this was a prerequisite for clearing the debts, and a solution should be decided on the spot. Next, the manager of the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank reported on the past years of business profit and loss of the Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangdong banks, and also stated that he had left after the crisis occurred in the bank and felt deeply guilty towards the creditors. However, when the Guangzhou branch was closed, he had telegraphed the Chamber of Commerce and the Public Security Bureau to maintain the situation and personally went to the Public Security Bureau to surrender and await punishment. Subsequently, he was granted bail and temporarily released. As it was his duty, he dared not evade anything. In the future, if any creditors summon him, he would arrive as soon as he was summoned in order to inquire. After the report was completed, a creditor, Mai, stood up and inquired about the bank's debts and the amount of loans issued. The manager explained in detail. Around 4:00 PM, the discussion focused on the establishment of a creditors' committee and the clearing method. The results of the discussion were as follows: (1) The debts of the Guangzhou branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank will be entrusted to the Guangdong General Chamber of Commerce for clearing. (2) Five creditors will be mutually elected to form a creditors' committee. (3) Some of the staff of the Industrial and Commercial Bank branch will be retained to assist in handling statistical matters, and the rest will be dismissed upon takeover. (4) The clearing must be completed within one month from the date of takeover. (July 27)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Recent News on the Sino-Soviet Eastern Railway Telegraph Rights Conference <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Telegraph Issue Resolved</p>
<p>Telephone Negotiations to Begin Soon</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: After Li Shaogeng's mediation, the Eastern Railway Telegraph Rights Conference's Special Committee first made contact last Saturday and Sunday. On the 21st of this month, the conference was formally opened. Because both parties had already exchanged views, the discussion was merely a formality on that day. The outline of the telegraph conference proposed by the Chinese side, which had been decided upon by the first Special Committee meeting, was reviewed again by the committee members of both sides. The unresolved matters were left to the Board of Directors for decision. From the 21st to the 23rd, after three days, the discussion was completed. At 10:00 AM on the 24th, both parties signed the resolutions, which will be used to negotiate the details of the contract. The contract's conclusion procedure will still be proposed by both parties and submitted to the Special Committee for review. Currently, the Chinese and Russian sides have begun to draft contract proposals, and a contract meeting may be held within this week. As for the items unresolved by the Special Committee, (1) the proposal for inspecting inbound and outbound telegrams, (2) the proposal for determining the amount of sovereignty fees, and (3) the method for connecting transit lines, all three matters have been entrusted by both China and Russia to the Eastern Railway Board of Directors for discussion. However, the speed of the decision on these three matters is not related to the progress of the Telegraph Rights Conference. As for the telephone issue, discussions may begin at the end of this month. It is heard that the disputes between the two sides are all on the telegraph issue, and only the asset portion of the telephone issue has been slightly studied. The Chinese side has allowed the special committee members of both sides to estimate the price, which will be paid by the Chinese side, either by paying cash or by deducting it from the Chinese side's surplus under the Eastern Railway. Since there are no disputes, resolution is easy. (July 24)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Shenyang Uncovers a Case of Privately Stored Military Weapons <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Japanese-controlled area of Shenyang Station has long been a den of iniquity. All kinds of private transportation of military weapons, sale of opium, morphine, and kidnapping of people rely on the protection of the Japanese police and are regarded as a safe haven. Our Chinese military police can do nothing about it. Unexpectedly, a large amount of privately stored military weapons was discovered within our national boundary on the 27th, and the number was shockingly large. Earlier, Zheng Junchen, a resident of Laoguabaozi, within the jurisdiction of the Ertaizi Branch of the Eighth District Public Security Bureau of Shenyang County, had three tiled houses leased to a French national, Bao Kesusu, as a warehouse for the Flying Dragon Machinery Factory, and a Chinese national, Song Heling, was assigned to manage the warehouse affairs. On the 26th of this month, the Shenyang County Public Security Bureau suddenly received a secret letter reporting that a large number of military weapons were hidden in the warehouse, and requested that personnel be sent to investigate as soon as possible. Zhang Detang, the director of the County Public Security Bureau, received the secret letter and personally led inspectors Gao Baohai, Wang Shida, and several policemen on the morning of the 27th, along with Li Zhanyi, the director of the Ertaizi Branch, to Laoguabaozi to guard the warehouse and force Song Heling to open the warehouse door. They sent police inside to inspect, and as a result, they found 373 boxes of light mortar shells, 24 shells in each box, 8 boxes of aircraft bombs, 40 bombs in each box, 18 boxes of Baelsh dynamite, and 2 boxes of miscellaneous medicines, as well as more than 2,000 pieces of large and small detonators. After completing the inventory, Director Zhang ordered the warehouse to be sealed off, sent police to monitor it, and took Song Heling back to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. At the same time, he reported to the Shenyang County Government for instructions. It was found that the Flying Dragon Machinery Factory (located in the Ten Room Place) had accidentally killed a worker two months ago due to the accidental firing of bullets while privately manufacturing rifles. Now it is privately storing a large amount of ammunition. What is the intention? It is very suspicious. It is unknown how our authorities will deal with it. (July 27)</p>

He reported on the previous request to postpone the implementation due to the busy farming season. However, the provincial order urges strict compliance and requires the compilation and reporting of the household registration of the defense corps.

<p>Thorough Investigation of a Privately Settled Homicide: Hua Ashi, a farmer in Dongwu Fangqiao, Fuhua Township, Dangkou Town, Eleventh District (Nanyan City), was naturally fierce. Recently, due to a dispute over field matters, he suddenly had a quarrel with Hua Axing, followed by violence, causing Axing to be injured and die from his injuries the day before yesterday. Subsequently, the deceased's old mother and wife seriously negotiated with the murderer Hua Ashi. At that time, a local ruffian, Hua Genbao, acted as a lobbyist, coercing the corpse's family to admit to a private settlement, with the murderer Hua Ashi paying 200 yuan in compensation. Unexpectedly, the local ruffian Hua Genbao swallowed all the compensation. The corpse's family did not receive a penny. Now, fair-minded people and the Party Department in the area are greatly angered and feel injustice. They intend to submit a request to the government for a thorough investigation in order to warn against illegal activities.</p>
<p>Labor Dispute Occurs in a Sock Factory: Since its establishment, the Yinyi Sock Factory outside Ximen in Xiyi has been doing well. Recently, the factory owner has delayed fulfilling the labor contract, reduced wages, excessively charged 12 yuan for the sock machine deposit cabinet, arbitrarily oppressed the workers, and suspended work for more than a month for no reason. 115 female workers of the factory, including Gu Weijin, believed that the factory owner's behavior was particularly hateful, and went to the Sock Industry Trade Union yesterday morning to petition. They were received by Changwu Wen Zichen, and then went to the County Industrial and Commercial Union to petition, and put forward four requirements: (1) The factory is required to comply with the labor contract immediately and pay wages according to the previously agreed rate without reduction. (2) If the factory does not accept socks, it must issue a clear rent for each machine, 12 yuan. (3) No fee shall be charged for self-purchased sock machines, and the money already received, 33 yuan per machine, must be returned. (4) The factory should be ordered to compensate for the losses during the suspension period. When the Industrial and Commercial Union's Standing Committee member Liu Qidi came forward to receive them, as a result, the Industrial and Commercial Union ordered Xie Bin and Wang Hongzhu to go to the factory for serious negotiations. If a satisfactory solution is not obtained, they will submit the matter to the County Government for review.</p>
<p>Robbery Reported Again in the Third District: Gu Pansheng, a resident near the Dadi Temple in the Third District of Xiyi (Yang Mingqing), makes a living by farming and sells furs every winter.

It is estimated that they robbed six yuan in cash and clothes, etc., worth more than 100 yuan. After obtaining the loot, the robbers roared away. After the investigation by the Eighth Branch Bureau of the Public Security Bureau, it was found that Xin Dacai, a boatman of the ferry near the area, had the situation of ferrying the robbers across the river. He immediately sent police to arrest him. Xin happened to have something to do in the city, so he immediately detained his concubine Chen Xushi at the bureau. Zhou, the director of the branch bureau, opened a court for a preliminary trial. Chen Xushi confessed that several people had called for a ferry yesterday morning, but she did not know that they were robbers, etc. After the interrogation, he prepared a document and submitted it to the County Government for interrogation.</p>

<p>Labor Strike at Yingchang Temporarily Comes to an End: Some time ago, all the workers of the Zhenjiang Yingchang Match Company went on strike to support the workers of the Shanghai factory. It is now heard that after the strike occurred, Xu Housheng, the manager of Yingchang, went to the Shanghai head office overnight for instructions and only returned yesterday. He then summoned all the workers to give a speech, asking them to be patient. Once a telegram arrived from the Shanghai factory, a satisfactory resolution would be found. The factory's subsidized rice would also be distributed on that day, according to the same method of four dou for each male worker and two dou for each female worker. Although currently in a period of work stoppage, the factory still followed the old practice of entering the factory at 6:00 AM and not dismissing until 6:00 PM. Therefore, additional guards were assigned to maintain order day and night.</p>
<p>Difficulties in the Navigation of Inland Waterway Steamers: This summer, the rivers and lakes have been experiencing high water levels, and the water level of the inland rivers has been rising daily. If the short-distance and long-distance steamers navigating the waterways of Yang and Huai travel at a slightly faster speed, the embankments would inevitably be affected. The people along the river, concerned about their lives and property, have been taking action to prevent the steamers from navigating. Yesterday, a steamer from the Sixth Company passed through the Balipu area of Yangshu. Although it was being towed slowly by a boat on the bank, the farmers on both sides of the river, still fearing danger, rang gongs and gathered a crowd to throw stones to stop it.

<p>Court Detains Newspaper Reporter: There are many newspapers in Yangzhou, including one called "Jiangdu Daily," which was founded by the county party headquarters. Recently, in a supplement of the newspaper, a short commentary entitled "I Only Wish That Conjecture Is Always Conjecture" was published. Wang Sixian, the chief procurator of the Jiangdu County Court Procuratorate, believed that the commentary insulted his personal reputation and immediately issued a warrant for the arrest of Zhang Caiyi, the reporter who wrote the supplement. Subsequently, the county party headquarters argued that whether the article was illegal was still under investigation. Even if there were indeed questionable parts, since it had been published, the newspaper was responsible, and the court should not abuse its authority and rashly arrest him. Moreover, Zhang was a party member, and the party headquarters should provide appropriate protection and prevent illegal arrest. The county party headquarters informed the police of this and sent a letter to the court, asking it to provide a written reply stating the reasons for detaining the reporter before proceeding with the investigation.</p>

<p>Further News on the Bandit Attack on Pujiapu: On the night of the 25th, at around 4:00 AM, hundreds of bandits suddenly attacked the Pujiapu area of Matang, Rugao. The police fought bravely to repel them. It is now known that when the bandits attacked, there were only twenty members of the local defense corps. Because of the disparity in numbers, they were surrounded by the bandits. After the corps members tried their best to resist, they broke through the encirclement. Squad leader Liu Shanjie and two corps members were shot and killed. The local defense corps was organized by the deputy township head, and the bandits harbored a deep-seated resentment towards him. Therefore, after attacking the defense corps, they crossed the river and surrounded the private residence of Wu. Wu woke up from his dream and tried to escape, but the bandits had already broken down the door and entered, so he was shot and killed. His wife and daughter were also shot dead one by one. Before leaving, they set fire to the house and completely destroyed it before leaving.</p>

<p>Provincial Government Reassigns County Magistrates of Four Counties: Zhu Jiahua, a member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government and Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, proposed at the 325th Provincial Committee meeting that the resignation of Xu Zhigui, the magistrate of Zhuji County, should be approved, and that Xie Yinmin be appointed to act as magistrate in his place. At the 326th meeting, he proposed that the resignation of Shen Jinxiang, the magistrate of Yueqing County, should be approved, and that Zhou Gengchang, the magistrate of Yunhe County, be transferred to act as magistrate in his place. He also proposed that Li Nanjun be appointed to act as magistrate in the vacancy left by the transfer of Zhou Gengchang.

<p>Mayor Cai Bans Rice Merchants from Manipulating the Market: Hangzhou Mayor Cai Zengji noted that the Hangzhou newspapers recently reported that rice was flowing in from Hushu in large quantities, and prices had fallen sharply, but the prices at the rice shops had not decreased. Citizens were complaining. The high price of rice in the city has lasted for several months, and the citizens are suffering greatly. If the price of rice from outside the city has fallen sharply, but the selling price remains the same, or has only decreased slightly, the rice merchants cannot avoid suspicion of manipulation for profit, which will easily incite public anger. If this is not prevented, a huge wave of unrest may be triggered. Therefore, yesterday, he specifically ordered the Social Affairs Section to send personnel to investigate the amount of rice coming from Hushu, the price, and whether the rice merchants are manipulating the market, and report back together for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Letter from Roy Chapman Andrews <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>The American Museum of Natural History in New York and the China Ancient Relics Preservation Committee have agreed on cooperation terms. With the permission of the Chinese government, passports have been issued for geological and paleontological research in Mongolia, with an equal number of specialists from China and the United States. Since departing at the end of April, we have been conducting research and exploration in the desert regions north of Zhangjiakou for over a thousand li. We have made significant discoveries in the strata of various eras and are continuing our work. The two specialists sent by the Chinese side are both experts in geology and paleontology, and the cooperation has been very satisfactory. However, a certain English newspaper recently published an article about my encounter with wolves on the journey, in which the wording regarding my Chinese colleagues was quite disrespectful. I was very surprised to read it. In fact, I have never met the reporter mentioned by the newspaper, and there is no way I could have had such a conversation. It may have been hearsay, with added imaginary words. If this causes any misunderstanding among my Chinese friends, I cannot be responsible and am very sorry. Encountering wolves and getting lost in the desert overnight are common occurrences for explorers. My Chinese colleagues and I have all taken it calmly and do not find it strange. I have already sent a letter to the original newspaper requesting a factual correction and telegraphed Shanghai to clarify. I would be grateful if you could publish this letter in your newspaper to avoid spreading false rumors. Sincerely, Roy Chapman Andrews.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Far East Quarantine Inspection Group, Including Burke, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Today Accompanied by Wu Liande to Japan</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reported that the Far East Port Quarantine Inspection Group arrived in Shanghai this morning (the 31st) on the President Taft. Its leader is Dr. Burke, who was originally the chief of port quarantine for Australia and was loaned to the Health Section of the League of Nations. He was sent to China by the League of Nations and worked with members of the Ministry of Health of the National Government to investigate the quarantine situation in various ports and assisted Dr. Wu Liande in formulating new port quarantine regulations. Therefore, he is very knowledgeable about the port quarantine situation in this port. He told reporters that the method of disinfecting ships used in Shanghai is of great interest to the group because it is different from that used in other ports in the Far East. Shanghai uses the German method of burning bone charcoal to produce a deadly poisonous gas that suffocates rats hiding in the ship's hold. Other ports in the Far East, according to the investigation, mostly use sulfur dioxide and hydrocyanic acid gas. The above three methods each have special value, so it is necessary to compare them. The Health Committee of the League of Nations is currently paying attention to the method of disinfecting cargo holds and has sent new members to specialize in this matter, so the group members attach great importance to it. He also said that the trip of the group is very beneficial and the interest is extremely high. They have already inspected ports in the Dutch East Indies, British Straits Settlements, French Vietnam, Hong Kong, Manila, and Guangzhou. Tomorrow (the 1st), they will leave Shanghai for Japan, and Dr. Wu Liande will also go with them. Japan is the last inspection site of the group. After completing the inspection, a meeting will be held in Japan to discuss the situation seen in various places in order to improve the situation. It is reported that the group was organized by the Health Section of the League of Nations so that health administrators in the Far East ports could send experts to compare the methods and procedures used in their ports with those in other ports, promote progress, and provide an opportunity for health administrators in various ports to get to know each other. After the group members arrived in Shanghai this morning, Dr. Wu Liande and others went to the dock to meet them and accompanied them to Dr. Wu's office in the Jianghai Customs Building. They were received by Minister Liu of the Ministry of Health, who delivered a welcome speech. At noon, Dr. Wu Liande hosted a banquet for the group members at the Dongya Restaurant. After the banquet, he accompanied them to visit various places along the Huangpu River and the Wusong Quarantine Station. In the evening, Minister Liu of the Ministry of Health hosted a banquet at the Dahua Hotel to welcome the group members.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Social Affairs Bureau Orders Cessation of Wusong Chamber of Commerce Meeting <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Informs Compliance</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that Wusong is a commercial group in the city area and should be unified. Yesterday, it specially ordered the City Chamber of Commerce to stop the Wusong Chamber of Commerce from holding a meeting. After receiving the order from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce for reference. The original letter read: To Whom It May Concern: Our Chamber of Commerce previously reported that your Chamber of Commerce had a regularly scheduled reorganization. At that time, the Wusong Town had already been approved by the former Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Association and the Social Affairs Bureau to establish a branch office. Subsequently, although your Chamber of Commerce stated that it had resolved not to establish a branch office, the Social Affairs Bureau still forwarded the original letter to the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Association for review. On June 21st, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Members' Representative Conference convened by the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Association still passed the motion to establish a branch office of the Wusong City Chamber of Commerce. Therefore, the original plan of the Social Affairs Bureau to approve Wusong's reorganization and establishment of a branch office of the City Chamber of Commerce has not been explicitly changed. The matter of whether your Chamber of Commerce's reorganization has been approved by the competent authorities is under review by the Social Affairs Bureau. Today, the 30th of this month, the Social Affairs Bureau approved the report, stating: Upon review, it is found that the Wusong Chamber of Commerce has previously submitted a report stating that it should not be reorganized into a branch office of the City Chamber of Commerce and requesting that a letter be forwarded to the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Association to withdraw the agreement. The bureau has already forwarded the matter to the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Association for reply, but has not yet received a reply. Now that the Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Association has ended, since the matter has been resolved by the Members' Representative Conference, it should be promptly and truthfully reported to comply with procedures. It is claimed that the foregoing situation should be approved to the Chamber of Commerce to promptly prevent the Wusong Chamber of Commerce from holding a meeting without authorization and to report the handling of the matter as required. The order has been sent to the Chamber of Commerce to stop the regularly scheduled reorganization of your Chamber of Commerce and to await instructions from the competent authorities for handling.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Coal Industry Labor Dispute <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Should Comply with the Main Text of the Arbitration Award</p>
<p>The coal industry labor dispute in this city. In April of this year, both parties submitted amendments to the agreement conditions. After the Municipal Party Department completed the review, it was sent to the Mediation Committee to convene mediation. The two parties were able to agree on most of the content of the conditions. However, the wage condition was insisted on, and the related rest days and meal and vegetable porridge items could not be decided. Therefore, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau requested the Municipal Government to submit it to the Arbitration Council for legal arbitration. However, the capitalists suddenly held different opinions and requested a retrial. However, the Municipal Government believed that the main text of the Council's arbitration award was extremely fair, so it issued an instruction yesterday, saying, "I have been informed. It is found that the 48 companies in the industry that went bankrupt were either due to meager capital or the influence of Jin Gui, which were difficult to maintain. They have their own legitimate reasons for bankruptcy. It cannot be said that they are all damages caused by wage issues. The proposed increase in income and reduction in expenditure is of course an important plan, but at a time when social life continues to increase, the living problems of workers should also be taken into account. The Arbitration Council instructed the capitalists of the industry to increase wages by 5%, and rejected the workers' request for 25 cents. The rest should still be handled in accordance with the original agreement between the two parties. Therefore, the arbitration award is as fair as the main text. The request for a retrial has no express provision in law, and it is difficult to approve it. You should comply with the arbitration award and implement it quickly. Do not delay it, lest it cause inconvenience. This is the approval."</p>

<h3 id="e106">Shaanxi's Recent Disaster Situation and Relief Efforts <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Report Obtained by Jisheng Society</p>
<p>According to Mr. Mou, a member of the Jisheng Society in China, who returned to Ji from Shaanxi, the disaster situation in Shaanxi is getting more and more serious every day. The following are a few points that the relief workers and others actually investigated and witnessed: 1) The situation is not stable, and banditry is rampant everywhere. Except for the hundreds of miles around Xi'an City, the roads are blocked everywhere. Even if you risk going to donate money, it is impossible to transport and send it. 2) The counties are harassed by bandits, and there is no pure land. The counties of a certain place are the most affected. People are fleeing, and the fields are barren. There is no seed to plant, and there is no harvest. The number of deaths is actually one-third. The situation is really unimaginable. 3) This association has witnessed that the disaster in Shaanxi is getting worse and worse, and the number of deaths is increasing. Due to various difficulties, relief efforts cannot be carried out. I have no choice but to change the establishment of refugee camps for disaster victims in Xi'an, Xianyang, Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, and Qishan, and refugee camps for disaster-stricken children. There are eight places in total, each accommodating hundreds of people every year. The counties where the land can be cultivated only account for 30% to 40% of the province. Only the old, weak, women and children remain. The strong are flowing and becoming bandits. Young women are trafficked out of the country. Disaster victims and disaster-stricken children have no home to return to, and there is no end to the withdrawal of the camp. Each camp spends money every month, and the funds are insufficient. 4) Director Zhang of Wugong and Pingdeng Counties and all the relief workers personally went to transport and release funds for relief, and experienced dangers. Fortunately, they all turned danger into safety. After observing the situation, it is difficult to handle. There is only an urgent plan to cure the symptoms and set up shelters to avoid filling the ditches. In this way, we have to compromise, take risks, and do our best. We have to be based on conscience and save a life if we can. All of these are the personal experiences of the relief workers in Shaanxi. Natural disasters and man-made disasters are rare throughout the ages, and it is difficult to convey the tragedy in face-to-face conversations and writing.</p>

Urgent need is felt for reconstructing the Central Police Station and Fire Brigade Stations, but the present confined locations render this impossible at the moment. The new works which are being planned consist of a large number of police, fire brigade, hospital and school buildings and one item in the essential new construction list is a rubbish destructor, the machinery for which is on its way, and the building design is being prepared.

<p>Permanent Provisions for One-Way Traffic on Hankou Road</p>
<p>At 4:30 pm on July 21st, the Public Works Department held a meeting of the Transportation Committee. Those present included Mr. Braun, Mr. Chen Tingrui, Mr. Macnaughten, Mr. Okamoto, the Additional Minister of the Police Department, and the General Office. The matters discussed were as follows: "Election of Chairman" proposed by Mr. Braun, seconded by Mr. Chen Tingrui, and Mr. Hepie was elected as Chairman. In his absence, Mr. Macnaughten acted as Chairman, which was approved by all. The minutes of the previous meeting were approved and signed by the members. "One-Way Traffic Rules": 1) Hankou Road: The trial period for one-way traffic on Hankou Road has now expired. This measure not only has a significant effect on the road, but also has a positive impact on the roads in the Central District and the Zhabei District. According to statistics, the number of vehicles traveling on Hankou Road in the three months since then is more frequent than in the past, while the number of accidents has been less. Therefore, the Director of the Police Department proposed that the measure should be made a permanent rule, so that traffic within the concession can be reduced. A month ago, the Chinese Ratepayers Association and other sectors within the concession sent letters to protest against the measure. After reviewing it, the Director of the Police Department revised the daily specified time as follows: from west to east, 8:00 am to 9:00 am, 1:00 pm to 2:00 pm; from east to west, 12:00 noon to 1:00 pm, 4:30 pm to 5:30 pm. All the members agreed that since the measure has achieved positive results on Hankou Road, they unanimously agreed to the proposal of the Director of the Police Department to make it a permanent rule, and also agreed to the revised time. 2) Yuanmingyuan Road: Mr. Martin, the Additional Minister of the Police Department, reported on the case of the trial one-way traffic on the road, saying that the Traffic Section had reviewed the case in detail. It was found that since the trial one-way traffic on the road, there had been no good results. It is not appropriate to continue this measure and it should be revoked immediately. However, in order to improve the current situation, it is stipulated that vehicles on the road can only be parked on the west side of the road at a certain number of points to avoid disorder. Prebendary Stevens has sent a letter to the Bureau, stating the various inconveniences that have occurred since the implementation of one-way traffic on the road. The letter was submitted to the committee for discussion, and the result was unanimous agreement to cancel this regulation. "Banning of Street Vendors": There are often many street vendors gathered on the west side of Nanjing Road and Tibet Road, which often obstructs vehicle traffic. The presiding officer proposed that it should be prohibited. It was resolved that the case should be handled by the Additional Minister of the Police Department and a notice should be issued to prohibit street vendors from gathering on the side of the road to facilitate traffic. The meeting adjourned at 4:50.</p>

<p>Since the Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet resumed the Vladivostok route, this year the Soviet Union has sent a committee to Shanghai to purchase and transport Chinese tea. The first batch can be shipped out today. The details of the purchase are recorded below:</p>
<p>Restoration of the Sino-Russian Cooperative Association: The Soviet Russian tea procurement agency in China is located in Shanghai and is named the Sino-Russian Cooperative Association. It specializes in purchasing Chinese tea leaves and packing them to Russia. When the two countries severed diplomatic relations last year, the cooperative association was closed and suspended its business, and the people in charge left Shanghai and returned to Russia, entrusting the British firm Jinlong to handle the unfinished business. Now that Sino-Russian shipping has resumed and trade between the two countries has also opened, the Moscow Cooperative Association has sent the original staff to Shanghai to restore the Shanghai branch. It has established an office at No. 2 Beijing Road and has notified various tea merchants to start handling goods and restoring the situation before the severance of diplomatic relations.</p>
<p>The first batch of new tea is shipped out: The new Chinese tea purchased by the cooperative association is mainly green tea and tea bricks. At the same time, Jinlong purchased a batch of new tea bricks on behalf of Russian merchants. The total of the two is more than 1,100 tons, which is entrusted to the Soviet Russian Commercial Team. The Roundland commercial ship chartered by Laisi Foreign Company in Shanghai will be loaded and exported to Vladivostok today. This is the first batch of goods to be shipped to Russia after the new tea was launched this year.</p>

<p>Completed as Ordered</p>
<p>The Chinese tram has a section of double-track turnout at the junction of Xuejiabangwai Road for changing trailers. The Municipal Public Works Bureau believes that it hinders traffic and, considering that the tram stop and the Shanghai South Public Bus stop are too close to each other, it is also very inappropriate. It ordered the Chinese tram company to remove the turnout there and move it 15 meters south of the intersection, and to exchange the tram stop and the public bus stop there to facilitate traffic. It is now known that the company has complied with the order and completed the relocation.</p>

This summer, the Road Bureau and the employees believe that the matter is related to the public welfare of the entire road and should not be delayed for a long time, so they specially designated the committee members of each group to actively work and open the public welfare societies that have been successfully built in Changzhou, Wusong, Zhakou, and Shanghai to benefit the employees.</p>

Most of the bee species are purchased from abroad, with the Italian species being the most imported, followed by the British and American species. When the price is high, each box reaches more than 30 yuan. Foreigners compete to import them for profit, and sell them with inferior bee species. When importing, the customs does not inspect them. Now the Ministry of Agriculture has ordered the Agricultural Products Inspection Office in this city to conduct strict inspections of imported foreign bee species in the future to benefit agriculture. After receiving the order, the office immediately prepared the inspection procedures and will send personnel to implement the inspection after contacting the Jianghai Customs.</p>

<p>The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and China Merchants Steam Navigation Co. docks in Pudong are stationed with twenty to thirty police officers from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to maintain order. Due to the high price of goods, these officers found it difficult to make a living with their current salaries. They reported this to their superiors, who forwarded a letter to the companies requesting an increase in rice subsidies to support their livelihood. After repeated consultations between the companies' compradors, Mr. Chen, and the British managers, recognizing the high cost of living as a fact, it was approved that each officer would receive an additional two yuan in rice subsidy from July 1st to show consideration. A letter was sent to Zhang, the district chief of the Third District of the Public Security Bureau, instructing him to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Where Did the Fake Promissory Note Come From? <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhaoshun Arrested by Police</p>
<p>Chen Yunfu, from Yuyao, operates the Rui Tai Silk Thread Shop at No. 472 Near Guan Bridge on Limalu in the South City. He has been in business for many years and is quite prosperous. Around 8 PM the night before last, Chen happened to be out. Suddenly, a man, about thirty years old and well-dressed, arrived at the shop. The staff recognized him as a customer and served him. The man took out a promissory note purportedly issued by the shop, worth sixty yuan, and asked to redeem it for cash. Upon inspection by the staff, it was indeed a Rui Tai promissory note. While they were discussing it, Chen returned to the shop and, after reading it, determined that there was no such note in the company's records. After a detailed investigation, it was discovered that the seal on the note was forged, making it a clear case of fraudulent redemption. They immediately called the police on duty in the area and questioned the man about his origins. The man appeared flustered and was immediately taken to the First District Police Station. The district chief ordered a preliminary interrogation, during which the man identified himself as Lu Zhaoshun. His other statements were evasive. The district chief, considering it a criminal case involving private seal engraving and fraudulent redemption of money with fake notes, ordered that he be transferred to the Shanghai Superior Court for investigation and legal action.</p>

<p>Hu Deguang, a shop assistant, and Ye Guorui, an apprentice, at the Jiashun pawnshop in Caojiadu, West Shanghai, were accused by the shop owner, Xiao Xueming, of stealing ninety-one pieces of jewelry in March of this year. After several trials at the Criminal Court of the District Court, they were declared not guilty at the end of last month due to a lack of evidence. The court's judgment is excerpted below: (Main text) Ye Guorui and Hu Deguang are both not guilty. The attached civil lawsuit is dismissed. (Facts) Ye Guorui and Hu Deguang were both employees at the Jiashun pawnshop opened by Xiao Xueming in Caojiadu. Ye Guorui also managed the key to the jewelry box. On March 22nd, the shop discovered that ninety-one pieces of jewelry were missing from the jewelry box. On the 20th, Xiao Xueming's wife heard a noise in the shop around 2 AM. Additionally, Hu Deguang was seen giving Ye Guorui a package containing "Hagao" (a type of cake) to give to someone on the morning of the 22nd, leading to suspicion that Ye Guorui and Hu Deguang were jointly involved in the theft. Xiao Xueming filed a lawsuit, and the prosecutor of this court investigated and prosecuted. In the attached civil lawsuit, the plaintiff also requested the court to order the defendants to compensate for losses of 800 yuan. (Reasoning) The establishment of facts should be based on evidence. This is the principle of criminal procedure law. The theft of jewelry from Xiao Xueming's pawnshop, suspecting Ye Guorui and Hu Deguang of jointly stealing, is based on the fact that the key on the night of the 20th was in the custody of Ye Guorui and was not handed over upstairs. (Omission) Based on the above discussion and conclusion, the criminal suspicion of the defendants cannot be proven, and they should be declared not guilty in accordance with Article 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The attached civil lawsuit should also be dismissed. The judgment is made as stated in the main text.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Water Police Kidnapping Case Demands 70,000 Yuan Ransom <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Suspects Tried Yesterday</p>
<p>Chen Guoliang, a squad leader of the 17th team of the 4th District of the Wusong Water Police stationed at Dingxing Sand, opposite Wusongkou; Zhang Liujin, the team leader; Wang Youcai; and five bandits dressed as military officers conspired to kidnap Wang Buyun, the head of the sand village, his son, Shi Yongshun (also known as Shi Xiaowa), the owner of the fishing line at Shitousha, and five others including Mr. Gong. Details have been reported in this newspaper. After the incident, Captain Gong sent personnel to arrest two suspects and interrogated them in the district. Yesterday, Shi Jiacheng, the son of Shi Yongshun, received a letter from the kidnappers stating that Wang Buyun and others were in Chenjiasha, Lusi, Jiangbei. They demanded 30,000 yuan for Shi Yongshun, 10,000 yuan for Wang Buyun and his son, and 30,000 yuan for the Gong family, totaling 70,000 yuan. They demanded the money be prepared within a week for negotiation and ransom, or they would resort to drastic measures. Shi Jiacheng, upon reading the letter, found the ransom too large to raise. He stated that his father, Shi Yongshun, had suffered multiple robberies and kidnappings in recent years, resulting in significant debts that he could not repay. He would have to leave it to fate.</p>
<p>Also, the suspects, Officer Huang, and water police officers Gong Xibao, Wang Luncai, Zhou Chongquan, and Peng Jie, were interrogated by presiding judge Zhang Wei of the county at 1 PM yesterday. Officer Huang Yutang stated that he was 48 years old, from Jiujiang. He supervised squad leader Gong Xibao, Chen Guoliang, and water police officers Wang Luncai, Zhou Chongquan, Peng Jie, Zhang Liujin, and Wang Youcai stationed at Ruifengsha. One day before the incident, a man in uniform came to the sand and visited squad leader Chen Guoliang, staying overnight. The next morning, when he left, Huang asked Chen who the visitor was, and Chen said it was an acquaintance from Haimen who had come to gamble. Later, around 2 PM, six more people came to visit Chen and talk, and then left shortly after. Huang was suspicious and asked about their background. Chen said they were all friends from Haimen working in a certain department there. They reported to him that outsiders suspected him of illegal activities. Huang told Chen that as long as he worked honestly and diligently, there would be no slander. Later, Huang and Gong went out on patrol, and unexpectedly, Chen coerced his brothers to hand over their guns and, together with Zhang Liujin and Wang Youcai, escaped and kidnapped people, which was unexpected. Squad leader Gong Xibao stated that he was 32 years old and that he was not aware of Chen Guoliang's collusion with bandits and had no relationship with him. Wang Luncai stated that he was 32 years old, from Qidong, and served as a squad member in the 17th team of the 4th District. He was unaware of Chen's collusion with bandits. When Chen forced them to hand over their weapons, Huang and Gong were on duty outside. He repeatedly pleaded with Chen and was not dragged away. Zhou Chongquan stated that he was 20 years old, from Chongming. On the day of the incident, Chen ordered him and his companions to put on their uniforms and carry their guns, thinking they were going on patrol. Chen instructed them to go to a certain place to kidnap people. He repeatedly begged to be excused, but his gun was taken away, and he knew nothing else. Peng Jie stated that he was 23 years old, from Anhui. After Huang and Gong went out, Chen immediately called them to put on their uniforms and set off with him, saying that they would not return. They found Chen's words strange and refused to go, which made Chen very angry. He took away their guns and bullets. When they spoke, Chen drew his gun and threatened them to go with him. They were terrified and fled to nearby homes to hide. However, Zhang Jinliu and Wang Youcai were still forced to go with him, and he knew nothing else, asking for leniency. Later, the victims' families arrived and stated that they did not see these five people during the incident. After reviewing the statements, Zhang ordered Huang and others to be taken back into custody pending further investigation. He also reported to County Chief Qiu, ordering his subordinates to assist the 4th District Water Police in arresting Chen Guoliang and others, investigating and prosecuting them, and finding out the whereabouts of the hostages for rescue.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Zhang Wenqing's Appeal on the Case of Conspiring to Kill His Step-Mother Concludes with Debate <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Prosecutor Requests to Uphold the Original Judgment</p>
<p>Judgment Scheduled for August 6th</p>
<p>At 9 AM yesterday, the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court continued the hearing on the case of Zhang Wenqing conspiring with others to kill his stepmother, allowing lawyers from both sides to make oral arguments. First, Zhang Wenqing's lawyer argued that the evidence in this case was based on the appellant's repeated confessions. Regarding the confession made in the police station, whether that confession could be adopted should be studied. According to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, a confession that can be used as evidence must be true and voluntarily stated. During the initial trial, Zhang confessed that after being detained in the police station, the detectives told him that if he confessed, he would be released, otherwise, he would be tortured. The confession made in the police station was coerced and should not be adopted. Zhang also said that the police station presented his confession form, which was written by the police personnel in advance and only asked him to sign it. Zhang, who knew how to read and write, should have written the confession form himself. If someone else wrote it on his behalf, it could not be used as evidence. Furthermore, the confessions of the other appellants were contradictory. For example, Yao Yonggui said he arrived at Zhang's house at 5 PM, while Gao Jintang said it was 2 PM. Regarding the reward, some said it was 500 yuan, some said 400 yuan, and some said 100 yuan. Such confessions should not be adopted. The confessions examined by this court may be credible because Chen Hengcai has now rediscovered his conscience and admitted that he alone killed Ms. Su. Although Chen, Yao, and Gao all said that when they entered Zhang's house, Zhang Wenqing was waiting on the escalator, this statement seems to be premeditated, but it actually shows Zhang's honest heart. If he was indeed an accomplice, he would not have waited there but would have avoided it early on. Chen Hengcai did this because he had borrowed 40 yuan from Su, and Su repeatedly demanded it back, leading Chen to develop malicious intent. After Su was injured and admitted to the hospital, Zhang still visited her and gave her medicine, showing that he had no intention of killing her. Therefore, Zhang was actually implicated and should be declared not guilty. Another lawyer for Zhang, Jiang Rong, supplemented the arguments made by the previous lawyer, Wang Chuanbi, stating that Chen killed Su partly for money and partly for some other relationship, which had nothing to do with Zhang. Then, Chen Hengcai's lawyer, Fan Gang, defended that Chen had already confessed to killing Su, but it was not intentional. Because Su repeatedly demanded the debt without success, she stabbed Chen with a knife, and Chen disarmed Su and accidentally stabbed her to death. This was unintentional and cannot be said to be premeditated. Lawyers Wang Shizong and Chao Kun also defended Yao Yonggui, stating that Chen Hengcai invited Yao Yonggui to Zhang's house, only knowing that he was going to play and not knowing about the murder. Yao did not strike a blow. It is difficult to recognize that Yao committed a crime. Gao Jintang was defended pro bono by lawyer Wu Zhiping, who stated that when Su was stabbed and admitted to the hospital, Chief Detective Hua went to inquire, and she said that Yao and Chen stabbed her. Su Xiaoting (Su's younger brother) also said at the hospital that Yao and Chen killed her, not mentioning Gao. Although Su's son said that Chen, Yao, and an unknown person killed his mother, this unknown person cannot be determined to be Gao. Gao should be declared not guilty. Then, the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the evidence of Zhang Wenqing and the other three's crimes was quite solid and requested the court to reject the appeal and uphold the original judgment. Finally, Chief Prosecutor Wang Zhennan stood up and expressed his opinion, stating that the facts of this case were extremely clear. After Chen, Yao, and Gao entered Zhang's house, they closed the back door, indicating that they had already planned it. The first defendant's defender, lawyer Wang Chuanbi, said that Zhang Wenqing was still waiting on the ladder when he saw Chen and others enter the room, showing that he was honest. However, this was not the case. When people have great hope, they often reveal their true feelings and forget their usual state. Zhang's waiting on the escalator was precisely when his hope was greatest. Judge Song then announced the end of the debate in this case and scheduled the verdict for the morning of August 6th.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Civil Servant Sues Over Loss of Money While Soliciting Prostitutes <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Xu Xiangfei's Fall is Pitiful</p>
<p>Zhang Teng'an Stains Official Integrity</p>
<p>Xu Xiangfei, a woman from Suzhou residing at No. 1180 Siwenli, Xinzha Road, is still unmarried. She once studied at a church school in Beiping, but dropped out due to the decline of her family. Recently, she was forced to make a living and willingly degraded herself. As a former female student, she became a private prostitute, going to major hotels in the evening to solicit customers. On the evening of the 28th of last month, Xu went to the Oriental Hotel on Xizang Road and was seen by Zhang Teng'an, a traveler staying in Room 249 of the hotel. Zhang originally worked at the Jinling Customs and came to Shanghai on business. Feeling lonely in the hotel, he was amazed by Xu's beauty and inquired with the tea boy, learning that she was a prostitute and could be recruited with money. He called her into his room and asked her to share his pillow. Xu demanded ten gold coins for the night. They slept together until 3 AM, and then Xu went home. The next night, she went to see him again, and they found each other very agreeable. Xu borrowed two gold coins from Zhang. They talked until late at night before parting. After Xu left, Zhang reopened his wallet and found that the eighty yuan he had stored were gone. Zhang believed that since no third party had entered the room, Xu must have stolen the money. Fortunately, he knew the woman's location after spending two nights with her. He reported this to the Laozha Police Station, and Detective Huang Fusen arrested the woman the night before last. Yesterday, she was brought to the Special District District Court and interrogated by Judge Xu. The police station's lawyers, Gan Jingxian and Hu Jiabao, stated the case, and Zhang proved the circumstances of the theft. Xu Xiangfei confessed that she stayed with Zhang the first night and went to talk to him for a while the next night, then went to Room 55 to sit for a while until 11:30 PM. Zhang gave her two yuan to buy opium. She did not see Zhang's wallet and did not know where the wallet was placed. She returned home the next day because she could not get the opium and returned the two gold coins. At that time, she was suddenly accused of theft, which was a false accusation. After questioning, Judge Xu stated that Zhang, as a civil servant, had tainted his official integrity by soliciting prostitutes. Furthermore, there was no evidence to accuse her of theft. He sternly reprimanded Zhang, who could only agree. Xu Xiangfei was released in court because there was no basis for the accusation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Zhang Aila Withdraws Lawsuit Against Zhao Jiabi <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Judge Personally Drafts Correction</p>
<p>Advises Plaintiff Not to Be Too Demanding</p>
<p>The "Chinese Students Magazine," published by Liangyou Book Company, has been published for two years. Its content is upright, and the student community considers it a useful modern publication. The editor, Zhao Jiabi, is a young scholar, so the magazine sells well. Previously, an article titled "Analysis of the Incident of Throwing Oneself into the Dance Floor" written by Wang Yuanxing was published in the second issue, number 14, which Zhang Aila (Zipinlan), who had once been known as the queen of Fudan University, believed damaged her reputation. She filed a lawsuit against the magazine. After the initial trial on the 11th of last month, both parties followed the court's instructions to settle out of court. However, because the plaintiff had intentions of demanding more on the drafted conditions, presiding judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Special District District Court held a continued hearing yesterday morning. The defendant hired two lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Qian Baohe, to defend. The plaintiff's lawyer, Li Zhongdao, was not present in court. Miss Zhang herself arrived with two young men in Western suits one quarter of an hour before the start of the trial. First, lawyer Chen stated that the manuscript published in the "Chinese Students Magazine" was based on the "Following Bai Ying and Leaving" article in the "Republic Daily" and did not contain any defamatory words against Zhang. However, due to the court's earnest advice, they had settled. However, the plaintiff was still making many demands, which was excessive. Judge Cheng then questioned the plaintiff, "You agreed to the settlement conditions in court last time, why do you regret it now?" Zhang replied that she was not entirely satisfied with the wording of the manuscript to be published in the "Chinese Students Magazine." Judge Cheng asked, "What are you not satisfied with?" Zhang replied that it did not state the source of the photos. Judge Cheng asked, "Is that the only point?" Zhang nodded. Judge Cheng then drafted a correction, "According to Ms. Zhang, the photos were stolen without her consent. This is hereby declared." After Zhang read the correction, she requested that the letter from lawyer Li Zhongdao to the defendant's lawyer also be published in the magazine. It was heard that the letter mainly praised Zhang's virtues at school. The court considered her request unreasonable and did not approve it. Judge Cheng also advised Zhang, "The 'Chinese Students Magazine' edited by the defendant is a valuable publication in society, and the words it contains have not damaged your reputation. The defendant also did not intend to insult anyone, so this kind of lawsuit should be ended early. Why be so demanding? Are you satisfied with the proposed correction now?" Zhang then agreed, and Zhang voluntarily requested to withdraw the case.</p>

<p>The Municipal Council (工部局) considers that the sale of aphrodisiacs by merchants is increasing daily. If strict prohibition is not enforced, it will cause incalculable harm to the population. Therefore, in addition to restricting newspapers from publishing such advertisements, it is also investigating homes selling aphrodisiacs to prosecute them according to the law. It has now been ascertained that the following seven establishments secretly sell various aphrodisiacs: Ji Cang Pharmaceutical Company at 422 Labour Road, Aix Pharmacy at 14 Haikou Road, Zhongnan Pharmacy at 429 Fuzhou Road, Bailin Company at 179 Park Road, Gefang Congji Society at 111 North Shanxi Road, Zhongxi Department Store at 478 North Zhejiang Road (corner of Haining Road), and a certain pharmacy in the French Concession. A request was made to the Special District Local Court for warrants to summon the managers of these pharmacies, Zhao Jicang, Mao Hongsheng, Wang Yiming, Chen Naigeng, Xu Zhiqing, and Zhou Zhangwu, for questioning and to authorize detectives to search each pharmacy. The court approved the request. The day before yesterday, Chief Inspector Xue Zhiliang and Inspector Pan Linshi of the General Inspectorate searched each location. Except for the pharmacy in the French Concession, which could not be searched due to jurisdictional issues, the other six locations were found to have a large quantity of aphrodisiacs with various names, such as "Unyielding Might Pill," "Yang Strengthening Pill," "Kidney Tonifying Pill," "Kidney Tonifying Elixir," "Contraceptive Powder," "Mandarin Duck Powder," and "Quick Removal Powder," too numerous to list. The Zhongnan Pharmacy had the most diverse variety. The account books of each establishment were also seized and sent to the police station. Yesterday morning, Judge Shen Shumu held a court hearing. None of the summoned Zhao Jicang and others appeared. Inspector Pan reported on the search process and stated that the Zhongnan Pharmacy had been selling aphrodisiacs for the longest time and profited the most. After newspapers disclosed the case of investigating aphrodisiac advertisements in newspapers a few days ago, the pharmacy anticipated the news and hid the prohibited drugs. Although the quantity seized yesterday was not large, the variety was the greatest in that pharmacy. Since all the defendants have not appeared, a postponement should be granted, he said. Judge Shen ordered the hearing to be rescheduled for this Saturday (tomorrow) to summon the defendants for questioning.</p>

<p>Crowd Watching a Dead Man</p>
<p>The Murderer Confessed Without Denial</p>
<p>Document Prepared for Transfer to the Court</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:20, Patrolman Zhang Heshan of the Sanguantang Police Station in the Second District of the Nanshi General Office was inspecting his patrol area. While patrolling near Qu Zhenren Road, he suddenly saw a crowd gathered in front of number 164, watching a male corpse lying on the ground. He immediately inquired in detail. According to eyewitnesses, the deceased was named Yang Chunshan, 43 years old, from Zaozhuang County, Zhili Province, and was a partner of a loan shark. He had been beaten to death a short time ago by Nie Yongfu and Zhong Guiyu, residents of Yancheng Road, Meixie Road. Upon hearing this, Patrolman Zhang immediately returned to the station and reported to the police officer. He then led police officers to Meixie Road, where he arrested Nie and Zhong and transferred them to the Second District General Office. After a detailed interrogation by District Chief Wang, Nie, 30 years old, and Zhong, 20 years old, confessed that Nie's wife, Zhou, had secretly escaped a few days ago, and they suspected the deceased knew about it, so they gathered a crowd and beat Yang to death. After questioning, District Chief Wang interrogated the witnesses Wang Laoer (19 years old, from Tongzhou), Xu Guangde (25 years old, from Yancheng), and neighbors Xu Haiquan, Xiao Jintang, and Peng Youqing. Since the case involved a beating resulting in death, he immediately prepared a document to transfer the case to the court. He also ordered the local bailiff to report to the court and request them to send personnel to the scene for inspection.</p>

<p>Loaned Bracelet Case Leads to Rape Counter-Suit</p>
<p>Xiao Jinhua and Her Husband Released on Bail</p>
<p>Xiao Jinhua, a woman from Ningbo who performs Tan Huang opera for a living, previously filed a lawsuit with the local court against Fu Gu, a woman from Ningbo, and her daughter Fu Gendi, accusing them of borrowing a gold bracelet from her and pawning it without permission, which was akin to fraud and embezzlement. After the court summoned them for questioning, Fu Gu and Gendi went to the prosecutor's office and accused Xiao Jinhua of helping her husband, Hu Jusheng, rape the 14-year-old Gendi. An order was issued for Xiao Jinhua to be released on bail, pending Hu Jusheng's appearance in court for questioning. The prosecutor's office also ordered Fu Gu to present evidence of the rape. Yesterday, the prosecutor's office held a hearing, and both parties appeared. Fu Gu presented a pair of pants as evidence. After questioning by the prosecutor and finding no bloodstains on the pants, Fu Gu was advised not to make false rape accusations, as rape is a serious crime and should not be taken lightly. Furthermore, the evidence was insufficient. Hu Jusheng was ordered to be released on bail, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>Teenager Saved After Jumping into the River</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:00 AM, the ferry from Lujiazui in Pudong was returning to Pudong from the Ningshao Wharf in Puxi with dozens of passengers. As it approached the center of the river, a teenager suddenly jumped into the river unnoticed. He briefly surfaced before being rescued by the crew. His face was pale, but fortunately, he did not swallow much water and was saved. He was handed over to the police officers at the dock and taken to the Third District Public Security Bureau. The teenager identified himself as Mo Yunping, 25 years old, from Zhapu, currently working as a partner at the Runtai Timber Company in the local garrison. When questioned about why he jumped into the river to commit suicide, he was evasive and refused to reveal the truth. He finally said that he had made a mistake in his work at the timber company. Eleven pawn tickets and two postcards were found on his person. The content of the postcards suggested that he was under economic pressure. He was scheduled to be sent to the Public Security Bureau in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Opium is Extremely Harmful</p>
<p>Yu Baozheng Almost Lost His Life</p>
<p>Around 9:00 PM the night before last, a middle-aged man jumped into the river in the dark at the Taikoo Wharf in the French Concession, intending to commit suicide. At that time, a Western policeman (Mai Qing) from the Water Police Station was patrolling the river on a boat. Upon hearing the sound, he immediately turned on the electric light and rescued the man. After being rescued, he was taken to the police station and identified himself as Yu Baozheng, 31 years old, from Haimen, who had lived in Shanghai for many years. He had previously worked at the telegraph office but was fired after being discovered to be addicted to opium. He had been unemployed ever since, was impoverished, and had exhausted all his possessions. He was unable to afford medical treatment for his illness, so he decided to end his life. Based on his statement, the police station sent Detective Ge Changsheng to take him to Renji Hospital for examination. At 11:30 PM that night, the original detective brought him back to the police station. When asked if he had any relatives or friends in Shanghai, he said that he had a relative named Zhang Baofu who was a builder and lived at number 23, Guo Xiang Lane, Hengtong Road, Zhabei. The police chief ordered the detective to bring Zhang to the police station and asked him to take Yu back temporarily, find a way to cure his illness, and then send him back to his hometown.</p>

<p>Luring Female Workers into Adultery</p>
<p>And Daring to Falsely Accuse and Extort</p>
<p>Qiu Zhongxi, 33 years old, from Shaoxing, currently resides at number 77, Toyota Workshop, Fanhuangdu, Shanghai West, and runs a boarding business. Cao Gengsheng, a fellow villager, is only 14 years old but appears to be an adult and is quite beautiful. She was brought to Shanghai by Qiu last autumn and works in a cotton mill. She boards at Qiu's place, leaving in the morning and returning in the evening. This had been the routine until last Saturday afternoon when the girl suddenly disappeared. Qiu searched everywhere, but there was no trace of her. Until about 7:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yin Xiuchong, a well-known resident of Chenjiadu, came to report to Qiu that the missing girl Cao Gengsheng had been lured away by Xu Chengchao, who lived in Zhoujiaqiao, and had been living and committing adultery at Yin's place for two nights. He was now staying at Li Qingshan's place nearby. Upon hearing this, Qiu was about to arrest Xu, but Xu had already heard the news and returned the girl to Qiu, falsely claiming that he had found her on his behalf, and extorted 30 yuan from Qiu. Qiu pretended to agree and immediately sent someone to invite Yin Xiuchong and Li Qingshan as witnesses and immediately called the police, arresting them all and taking them to the Sixth District Police Station. After separate interrogations by District Chief Ren, Qiu Zhongxi, 33 years old, from Shaoxing, residing at number 77, Toyota Workshop, testified that he runs a boarding business. Cao Gengsheng, 14 years old, from Shaoxing, testified that she works in a cotton mill and was lured to Yin's place by Xu Chengchao, where she committed adultery for two nights, and then committed adultery at Li's place for four nights. Today, he sent me back and demanded 30 yuan from Qiu, which is the truth. Xu Chengchao, 29 years old, from Su County, Anhui, residing at number 57, 40 Jian, Zhoujiaqiao, was evasive. Yin and Li testified that Xu had committed adultery with the girl for six nights. After obtaining the confessions, District Chief Ren believed that the case involved luring into adultery and daring to extort money, which was hateful. Yesterday, he prepared a document and sent it to the local court for investigation.</p>

<p>Zhu Chengwen, a 39-year-old Guangdong native, residing at number 15, Dade Lane, North Sichuan Road, used to work as a detective in the Public Security Bureau but was recently laid off and is unemployed at home. His wife, Zhu Wen, 38 years old, suspected that her husband was having an affair because he often did not return home late at night. The couple often quarreled. The night before last, they had another argument, and Zhu Wen, out of anger, beat Wen violently and stormed out, not returning all night. Filled with resentment, Wen had thoughts of suicide. Around 12:00 noon yesterday, she bought one yuan's worth of raw opium from outside and swallowed it all after returning home. Around 5:00 PM, the poison took effect, and she became delirious. The neighbors discovered this and rushed her to Tongren Hospital and then to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Her life is in critical condition.</p>

<p>Extortionists of Stall Vendors Apprehended</p>
<p>Chen Fujin Sent to the Bureau for Interrogation</p>
<p>There is a vegetable market near Caojiaqiao, Ximen, which is convenient for residents. The business of the small vendors is not bad. However, Chen Fujin, in the name of the Shanghai Nanshi Vegetable Stall Trade Association, extorted donations from the vendors. Vegetable stalls had to pay 2.4 yuan, and meat stalls had to pay 10 yuan. Those who suffered from this were initially angry but dared not speak out. Recently, all the small vendors jointly discussed ways to eliminate this harm and reported it to the First District Party Department, requesting relief from this pain. When the First District Party Department sent personnel to investigate yesterday morning, Chen Fujin was extorting from the vendors at the scene and was witnessed by the investigators. He was immediately arrested, and many cards and licenses were found in the leather bag carried by Chen Fujin. He was immediately sent to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Did Zhang Zhou Die of Poverty?</p>
<p>Zhang Miaoen, a 26-year-old native of Tongzhou, used to work as a worker in a factory. Last year, he married Zhou, a fellow villager, as his wife. She is now 19 years old and lives in number 17, Qingsheng Lane, Baoxing Road, Zhabei. Since their marriage over a year ago, the couple's relationship has been good. However, Zhang is a worker and only earns six or seven yuan a month. Zhou is also naturally foolish and unable to find work. As the cost of living rises daily and rice and firewood are expensive, Zhang's income, after deducting rent, leaves only three or four yuan, which is not enough to cover their meals. Zhou felt sorry for herself, endured hunger, and had thoughts of suicide. This morning, while her husband was at work, she hanged herself in the room. The patrol police found out and reported to the First Section of the Fifth District, ordering the guarantor to report to the local court. Yesterday afternoon, the prosecutor arrived at the scene, confirmed that she had died by hanging, and ordered her husband to prepare a coffin and collect the body.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government Requests Instructions on the Authority and Responsibility of Organizing Temples</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, formerly the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee, sent a letter to request the results of the registration of temple properties in the city, both registered and unregistered, in order to jointly organize the matter. The Municipal Government considered that the registration of municipal temples fell within the scope of administrative affairs, and the Temple Registration Regulations did not explicitly state that the Executive Committee should jointly organize it. Therefore, it specifically submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, asking for instructions on how to handle the matter and requesting a prompt review and approval. The report stated that the case involved the handling of municipal temples by party and government agencies, and requested instructions on how to divide the authority and responsibilities and requested a prompt review and approval. Previously, a letter was received from the Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City, stating that the temples in the city had been registered by your government in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the National Government. The outside world knows little about the results. At the beginning of this political training, such superstitious businesses should be properly handled. Therefore, we specifically request you to investigate and announce the results of the registration of all the temples in the city, both registered and unregistered, in order to jointly organize them. We hope to receive a reply. In response to this, the registration of temples by the government is based on current laws and regulations. According to Article 14 of the promulgated Temple Registration Regulations, after the registration is completed, the handling agency, the Special City Public Security Bureau, shall submit a register to the competent Special City Government for record. Article 15 states that a report shall be submitted to the Ministry of Internal Affairs every three months, etc. Inquiring into the intention of the legislation, there is no need for publication. Moreover, Article 10 of the same regulations briefly states that the registration of temples in the Special City is the responsibility of the Public Security Bureau. Also, Article 5 of the Regulations for Supervising Temples states that the property and legal items of temples shall be presented to the local government for registration, etc. It is clear that the handling of temples falls within the scope of administrative affairs, which is self-evident and needs no further explanation. Now, the city's Executive Committee requests to publish the registration case and jointly organize the temples, which is intended to eliminate superstition, and the government fully agrees with this. However, the work of political training has its own systems, and party-government cooperation also has its own responsibilities and powers. This time, the Executive Committee's proposed appropriate handling and joint organization of various sections, the government has no legal basis to follow. The question of how to handle this matter is reasonably combined to submit a document for your approval, which is really for the public convenience, etc.</p>

He was heading to Fangban Bridge to take a tram to Nanshi and then a boat to his hometown. Because martial law was in effect, there were many police detectives stationed near Fangban Bridge. Zhang Hongru's appearance was suspicious, so he was searched, and a large bag of opium was found. When asked where he had brought the opium from, Zhang claimed that he did not know it was opium and that a friend had asked him to carry it. He was immediately arrested and taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Letter Received</p>
<p>Yesterday, I read a news article in your newspaper on July 28 entitled "Old Bombing Case Leads to Litigation." This incident occurred at 6:00 PM on June 20 in a trash can on Qinglian Street in the city. A discarded shell exploded, injuring six people. The First Section of the Second District sent police officers to transport the six injured people to Renji Hospital for treatment and to investigate the facts. It turned out that a homeless rogue from the street had picked up a discarded shell from the trash can and was playing with it when it exploded. After interrogation by the General Office, it was ordered that our store pay 50 yuan for the medical expenses of the injured and fined 30 yuan, which was settled. The report published in your newspaper on July 18 was inaccurate and concerned the reputation of our store. We are specifically requesting that your newspaper make a correction.</p>

<p>Outline of the Organization of Children's Courts</p>
<p>Proposed by the China Child Welfare Association</p>
<p>Children's Courts (Juvenile Courts) are *</p>
<p>Organizations specially established by civilized countries in modern times. The nature of juvenile delinquency is different from that of adult crime. It is inappropriate to send them to ordinary courts to be equated with ordinary adult criminals. The China Child Welfare Association has a Children's Protection Department, which has been working tirelessly to protect children. Recently, it has also drafted an outline for the organization of children's courts, which will be submitted to the National Government for adoption and implementation.</p>
<p>I. ㈠ The jurisdiction of the Children's Court extends to the following cases: (A) Crimes committed by children. Although the Chinese Criminal Law stipulates that the actions of people under the age of 13 are not punishable, and that people between the ages of 10 and 13 who commit crimes can be sent to reformatories, there are still many cases of juvenile delinquency that are not considered violations of the law by the Chinese Criminal Law, which really require the compulsory judgment of the Children's Court. For juvenile offenders, after interrogation by the Children's Court, they may be sent to vocational schools or charitable organizations. For children who have lost their parents, the Children's Court may temporarily adopt them. (B) Children's (</p>
<p>C) Improper conduct may be voluntarily submitted to the court by parents or other guardians. (C) Children who have been harmed, such as adults who have been accused of infringing on children, stealing children's belongings, selling or abusing slaves, and others, adults who incite children to commit crimes, fraudulently buying stolen goods from children, encouraging children to commit illegal acts, and others, adults who are unable to bear the responsibility of educating children, unable to send children to school, unable to provide children with medical care, and others, first send the adult who harmed the child to the Children's Court for questioning, and after restoring the losses of the harmed child, send the adult to the ordinary court for trial. (D) Divorce and separation cases involving children. Ordinary divorce and separation cases are naturally accepted by ordinary judicial organs, but the issues of child management and education must be transferred to the Children's Court for handling. (E) Regulations on the education and upbringing of illegitimate children. Judges may order the parents of illegitimate children to be responsible for the education and upbringing of their children. (F) Guardianship matters concerning children who are contrary to normal behavior. Contrary to normal behavior refers to those who are neurasthenic, intellectually weak, and have manic behavior. (G) Child labor cases, eliminating occupations that harm child labor, limiting the maximum working hours, prohibiting night work, and others. (H) Concerning orphans and abandonment, examining the economic conditions of their families, finding ways to provide children with medical care, and controlling their occupations and environment. ㈡ The jurisdiction of the Children's Court extends to all children under the age of sixteen, regardless of gender.</p>
<p>II. Organizational Law ㈠ Judges should be qualified professionals with a longer term of office to focus on service. Six years is generally the most appropriate. During their term of office, in addition to interrogating cases, they must also guide the work of the court. ㈡ Case Prosecution Department, (A) Each prosecutor cannot handle more than 50 cases at the same time. (B) Department members must be prudent in matters, verify qualifications, pass examinations, and their minimum qualifications must be a university degree or equivalent academic ability, or a graduate of social sciences, with at least one year of case research under supervision, and must have excellent personality and character, discernment, intelligence, and understanding. (C) The remuneration of prosecutors must be based on their performance. The salary level is roughly similar to that received by personnel in other social organizations. Salary increases must be based on their work performance and efficiency. ㈢ In the initial stage, the scope of the Children's Court is limited to the attached courts of the local court. ㈣ Recording system. Each court must have a recording system for compiling legal records and other records related to investigations and completed work. Various investigation records must contain the necessary facts of case studies in the active plan, in progress, and after success. At the same time, a chronology of supervisory affairs must be recorded. ㈤ Appraisers. Appraisers handle scientific or difficult events. ㈥ The application of case research and scientific methods, cooperating with courts in several case-free clinics, can collect case materials and various methods for treating transgressing children. This is a valuable reference based on the prevention of the future and the diagnosis of the past.</p>
<p>III. Procedural Law ㈠ The pre-trial judge or the prosecutor designated by the judge must review various lawsuits, add various political materials from the social aspect, and then decide whether it is necessary to formally file a lawsuit with the court. ㈡ Interrogation. Interrogation must be serious and accurate, and unnecessary publicity and rituals are generally exempted. ㈢ The definite plan for handling the case, although in this trial period, must also be clearly stipulated, and the chief prosecutor or other supervisor must check it together every month. Reporting at a reliable time is a valuable aid for inspection, but reporting is not a substitute for case research methods. The court shall find ways to collect laws and regulations on helpless people and illegitimate children, and when necessary, shall find ways to collect laws and regulations on wives' ransom.</p>

<p>Director Chen of the Zhejiang Education Department stated that due to the current period of high gold prices and low silver prices, the previously determined travel expenses for students from the province who passed the entrance exams or were recommended to study abroad were vastly different from the current situation. He was planning to increase them appropriately. Coincidentally, students who passed the entrance exams, such as He Tai, requested that 554 US dollars be issued to each person for travel expenses abroad. Director Chen believed that the travel expenses for studying abroad in this case were decided by the Provincial Committee, so it was not appropriate to change them. He specifically submitted a proposal to the Provincial Government for review and approval. It is now known that the Provincial Government has approved the issuance of 450 US dollars to each student sent to study in the United States this year.</p>

<p>The Second Summer School organized by the Anhui Education Department this year has been running for two weeks since its opening. Everything is more perfect than the first summer school. The number of hired teachers has increased by about three times, the number of students has increased by about two times, and the number of courses offered has increased by about five times. In addition, the strictness of coursework training (all courses have exams), the emphasis on extracurricular activities (such as visits, travel, film entertainment, and various ball games), and the publication of a three-day wall newspaper (with over 100,000 words) are all features of this session. All exams were completed on the 26th of this month, and the graduation ceremony was held at 7:00 AM on the 27th. Many students attended enthusiastically. Cheng Dazai was absent due to illness, and the ceremony was presided over by Yang Zhongming, director of the Department of Education. After the ceremony, Yang reported on the overview of the process and said that a summary report would be compiled and printed. Then, lecturer Xu Kangmin gave a speech, saying that everyone's consistent perseverance is admirable, and hoped that they would use this to revitalize Chinese education. Hao Yaodong gave a speech, saying that the spirit of the school has three points: emphasis on practicality and non-empty talk, which are not available in ordinary schools. Student Huang Xiangwen gave a speech, saying that summer school is the best opportunity for them to improve their studies, and hoped that the Education Department can continue to do so. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 AM, and commemorative badges and diplomas were issued. The students also left the school one after another. The grand Second Summer School came to an end.</p>

<p>The inspection reports of various county-run schools in Wuxian County for the 18th year have been submitted to the supervisors and education commissioners for review. The Education Bureau received instructions from the Education Department yesterday, roughly stating that the supervisors Wang Zengzuo and Gao Zu'en, as well as the education commissioners of the first district Xu Wenlan, the second district Sun Nianzu, the fourth district Feng Sichang, and the eighth district Zhou Zhiyan, had been meticulous in their criticism, verification, and guidance, which is deeply appreciated. According to the investigation, the principal of the Rural Normal School has a well-organized administration and plan. The principal of Xietang Elementary School has studied moral education and teaching in detail. The remaining rural schools, such as (Wenchang), (Zhongxiu), (Fuli), (Zhouzhuang), (Chenmu), (Libi), (Mudu), (Huangdai), (Chefang), (Biluo), (Dongyuan), (Huili), (Houxiang), (Heqiao), (Beizhuang), (Huxiang), and (Zhili), should all be notified and commended by the Bureau to encourage them.</p>
<h3 id="e159">General Resignation of Teachers in the Urban Area of Yangzhou <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Due to the Large Reduction in Elementary School Funding</p>
<p>Xin Fang and 147 other elementary school teachers and staff in the urban area of Jiangdu County have jointly submitted a request to the Education Bureau for permission to resign and seek other livelihoods due to the recent promulgation by the Education Department of the outline for the preparation of education budgets for various counties, which greatly reduces funding for elementary schools, making it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. The original request is recorded as follows: "Submitting a request for resignation due to reduced salaries and difficult living conditions, in order to give way to the virtuous and capable. The education expenses of Jiangdu have always been strained, and the salaries of teachers and staff are at most about 3,000 yuan per month. Even if they are paid monthly without arrears, there is still concern that it will not be enough. Compared with the party's political program of increasing education funding and developing child-centered education, the difference is as great as the sky and the earth. We were hoping to gradually increase funding and raise salaries in the future to ensure the stability and enrichment of the foundation of elementary education. Unexpectedly, the Education Department of Jiangsu recently promulgated the outline for the preparation of education budgets for various counties, which greatly reduces funding for elementary schools, making the lives of elementary school teachers and staff in the county even more difficult. On the part of the Bureau, the orders from superiors are clear, and they must be followed. Even the teachers and staff of each school should educate for the sake of education and not haggle over every penny, disregarding the foundation of the country's cause. However, with the rising tide of money and salaries that have not been increased, we already feel extremely embarrassed. If we further reduce funding, what difficulties can we imagine? At the county education administrative meeting this time, there was also a resolution to temporarily maintain the status quo regarding the budget issue, and the Reorganization Committee of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department also submitted a request to increase the salaries of elementary school teachers, which is reasonable. Furthermore, a few days ago, four representatives were jointly elected by our colleagues to go to the province with the Bureau Director to state the situation of Jiangdu's education funding and the impossibility of reducing it to the Department. Section Chief Yang Li received them and said that the budget standards previously issued by the Department were not without the possibility of flexibility. If there are special circumstances in each county, they can be handled with discretion and flexibility, and the Department's order is based on the principle of not reducing individual salaries. The Department's intention to maintain the lives of teachers and staff can already be seen. Now, the Bureau is adhering to the Department's order and is determined to implement the new budget. Our colleagues cannot deliberately violate the Department's order, nor can we disregard the safety of our lives. After repeated consideration, we are deeply afraid that our lack of focus will affect the development of our careers. Therefore, we all resign to give way to the virtuous and capable. We beg you to approve our resignation and hope that the salaries owed for each month will be paid off immediately to complete the procedures."</p>

<p>The Japanese organizations in this city originally had a resolution to establish a middle school next year using the campus of the East Asia Common Script College, and appointed representatives to return to their country to request subsidies from the government in order to realize this plan. According to a letter from the representative to Mr. Lin, the chairman of the various road joint committees, the government is now implementing a fiscal austerity policy, and even the existing educational subsidies for civil organizations from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs may be cancelled. Therefore, it is difficult to realize the plan to request government subsidies to establish a middle school.</p>
<h3 id="e163">New Plans for Daxia Middle School <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Many Aspects Worth Learning From</p>
<p>Daxia Middle School in this city is a complete middle school affiliated with Daxia University, divided into junior and senior high school sections. The senior high school section is divided into three departments: general studies, normal school, and business. The school's educational management facilities have always been well-known and perfect. It is said that they will become even more general in the autumn semester and there are many aspects worth learning from. Below is the letter from the school to the students' parents: Dear Parents, We are writing to you to inform you of the school's facilities for the progress of the students' studies and the cultivation and forging of their minds and bodies. We feel that it is necessary to notify you of the school's facilities at any time, and we sincerely hope that we can get your full cooperation because of this. It is not only the good fortune of one school and one family. Here are the current situation of the school and the decisions that have been decided to be implemented after the autumn semester for your review: 1. School Buildings and Equipment. Our school originally rented houses on Gordon Road as school buildings. Although the school officials have done their best to open the school for five years, the results are still satisfactory, but the junior and senior high schools are not in the same place, and the school area is also cramped. As a result, teaching and guidance have not been as ideal as possible. The university department has now purchased nearly 200 acres of land in Fanwangdu and built its own school buildings, which will be moved after the summer. The remaining Jiaozhou Road school buildings, classrooms, auditoriums, libraries, dormitories for male and female students, sports fields, and all other equipment will be completely moved to this middle school for use. The university department originally had more than 1,400 male and female students. Now, the school buildings and equipment for more than 1,400 people will be moved to this school for use, which will be more spacious than the original equipment of our school. Since our school was opened five years ago, it was officially registered by the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau last spring and was approved by the Education Department and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for record-keeping. The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has determined that the school's education and management are serious and the content is rich. It has decided to provide subsidies from the 19th year to expand the government's intention to cultivate talents. 2. Teaching. Our school firmly believes that teaching and learning have a very close relationship. Although the achievement of personal academic knowledge depends on the degree of personal effort, the induction of interest in effort and the guidance of learning methods cannot but be the responsibility of the teachers. The improvement of students' grades is not only a negative sanction for declining students, but also a guidance for all students to automatically know what to work hard on. This point, our school has always paid attention to it. At the time of the beginning of the academic year, we decided to hire teachers and staff who are both knowledgeable and experienced and who are brave enough to take responsibility to take charge of the teaching of each subject and the duties of each department. When all the teachers and staff are decided, we will report their names, origins, and experiences to the parents regarding the teaching affairs or duties they are in charge of at the school. Our school not only hopes that there will be a considerable understanding between the school and the family, but also hopes that the teachers and staff and all parents will have a considerable understanding. This will be of great help to the school's teaching management. Regarding academic examinations, our school has always attached great importance to the monthly and semester examination reports, which will still be directly mailed to your parents. Please pay attention to your children's academic performance at school here. If you do not receive the academic performance report, please notify our school immediately and attach the detailed mailing address. If your parents change the mailing address, please notify the school at any time. After the autumn semester starts, our school will implement a self-study room system and force students to exercise after class. It is now scheduled that all student dormitories will be locked by the Moral Education Department from 8:00 AM to 9:00 PM every day except Sundays and holidays. Each tutor and teacher of each subject will guide the students to study in the self-study room. From 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every afternoon is the time for students to exercise after class. Students must go to the sports field to exercise. Our school has hired physical education instructors to be responsible for guiding everything, so that students can have the opportunity to fully develop both academically and physically. 3. Moral Education. Our school will make the training and guidance of students' lives more reasonable and strict in the future, in order to cultivate energetic and orderly youths. Male and female student dormitories have always been separated in our school. The university department built a female student dormitory on the west side of the school last year, which can accommodate nearly 100 female students, and is now fully used by our school. It is the most concerned thing for the parents and school officials to guide whether the female students are healthy or not at school. Our school has specially hired a doctor with rich knowledge and experience as a health instructor. All students will have a health checkup once a month, and the results of the checkup will be filled out in each student's health report and mailed directly to each parent every month along with the academic performance report. Here, please pay attention to your children's health at school. If you do not receive it, please notify our school immediately. Starting from the autumn semester of this year, male and female students must wear school uniforms. Each student must prepare at least two sets of summer school uniforms and one set of winter school uniforms. The quality, color, and style must be consistent. The cost of this school uniform is about 20 yuan. The surplus will be returned and the deficit will be made up. Shanghai is prosperous. Our school students have also decided to wear school uniforms, so please do not let your children bring gorgeous clothes to school. It is not necessary to bring other valuables to avoid accidents. Our school estimates the highest and lowest amount of living expenses for male and female students as follows. I hope your parents will pay attention. If you want to avoid your children wasting money, you can deposit the expenses for one semester at the school. The school will give them to your children in installments as ordered.</p>
<p>Tuition Fee: Minimum 25 yuan per semester, Maximum 30 yuan per semester; Accommodation Fee: 20 yuan, 20 yuan; Meal Fee: 30 yuan, 35 yuan; Miscellaneous Fee: 15 yuan, 25 yuan; Book Fee: 5 yuan, 25 yuan; Pocket Money: 15 yuan, 30 yuan; Total: 110 yuan, 165 yuan; Remarks: All new and old students of our school must wear uniforms from this semester. In addition to the above expenses, they must pay an additional 20 yuan for uniforms. After that, old students will be exempt from this fee. 4. In addition, in addition to the school's guidance on the further education and employment of graduates, the school is very willing to fulfill the responsibility of investigation and introduction if your parents need special help from the school. In addition, if you want to be stricter in the management of your children or want to focus more on a certain subject, you can also state the reasons in detail at any time, and the school can consider it. After a relative amount of time, the results can be reported to the parents. We hope that your parents will pay close attention to the above points and cooperate with the school. Principal Wang Boqun and Director Ni Wenya of Daxia Middle School affiliated with Daxia University.</p>

<p>The Japanese delegation participating in the Third World Women's Games, with the enthusiastic assistance from various parties, has completed all preparations and departed from Osaka on the night of July 24th, embarking on their journey. As reported by this newspaper, their itinerary includes passing through Korea and Liaoning, with a one-day stay in Harbin for practice before taking the train to Siberia. They are expected to arrive in the capital of Czechoslovakia, the venue for this year's Games, on August 10th. The Games will commence on September 6th. After the Games conclude, the Japanese athletes will visit major cities in Western Europe, such as Berlin, Paris, and Bern. The Japanese public and private sectors have taken this participation of six athletes very seriously. The total amount of donations received by Ms. Hitomi, Ms. Nakanishi, Ms. Honjo, Ms. Muraoka, Ms. Watanabe, and Ms. Hamasaki has reached over 18,000 yuan, demonstrating the Japanese's promotion of sports. The Ministry of Education, Osaka Prefecture, Osaka City, Mainichi Newspaper, various tram companies, and Ms. Hitomi's alma mater, Nikaido Women's School, have all made substantial donations. Recalling the Second Games four years ago, only Hitomi participated for Japan, yet she overcame strong opponents from nine countries, qualified for three events, and won the World Women's Championship. In the past four years, Japan's performance has grown steadily, with five new emerging athletes. Therefore, this year, Japan aims to continue dominating the championship.</p>

<p>Yesterday's amateur tennis tournament at the City First Public Sports Field was affected by intermittent rain, making the court occasionally wet. Only one match between Shen Zhiming and He Ruzhi of the Hao group was played in the afternoon at 5:30 PM. Both are newcomers to the tennis scene, but their skills have improved significantly since practicing this summer. At the beginning of the match, they exchanged leads, each winning three games. Shen's strength lies in his ability to strike vital points, with particularly excellent backhand usage. He's strength lies in heavy hitting and fierce momentum. However, He suddenly became weak and lazy in running after the ball. Shen cleverly used a feinting tactic to confuse him. Ultimately, Shen won the match with scores of 6-3 and 6-0. If the weather is good today, matches will continue to be played. The schedule for this afternoon and tomorrow morning is as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e171">Special Notes on the Chinese Youth Asia Walking Group Zhao·Ding·Ming <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Youth Asia Walking Group has been on the road for a month since it set off. What is the progress? I think this is what those who are interested in the walking business want to hear. So I collected what I heard and saw, and recorded it in a miscellaneous way.</p>
<p>Looking back, the group set off at about 4 p.m. on the 28th of last month. Suddenly, there was a downpour. They happened to be at Longhua. It was as if God was testing their determination. At the beginning of their journey, being drenched by the heavy rain could temper their skills and express their firm will. So they still moved forward in the rain. They camped overnight in the fields near Xinzhuang. They set off at 5 a.m. the next morning. In a few days, they walked to Hangzhou. Because they left Shanghai in a hurry, they did not have time to get their passports. So they submitted a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to get them, so as to conduct a survey of the living conditions in various places. However, the Zhejiang Provincial Government believed that it was the proper procedure to obtain a passport at the place of departure. In the future, the provinces and cities that the group travels to should sign and confirm and give them protection. So the group elected the liaison officer Huang Yuejun to return to Shanghai overnight to apply for a passport from the Shanghai Municipal Government. The next day, the Shanghai Municipal Government approved the request. Huang took a document and returned to Hangzhou to report the order. After asking the Zhejiang Provincial Government to sign, he went forward again. Huang once asked me to draft a document and talked to me a few words. Only then did I know that he had this twist.</p>
<p>Recently, I met the so-called liaison doctor Huang Jingwan. I was able to see the reply letter sent by the group from Ningbo, and attached the words of congratulations from various celebrities before departure. I will record them here.</p>
<p>Forward (Yu Youren) Safe journey (Shanghai Jingwu Sports Association) Strong and unceasing (Hangzhou Yousheng Travel Association Branch) Unity of knowledge and action (Lin Jing) Courageous and diligent (Ye Gongchuo) No distance is too far (Zhang Renjie) Thousands of miles of travel (Huang Wan) A great man takes the world as his home (Chen Liting) Reading ten thousand books is not as good as traveling ten thousand miles. (Ge Gongzhen) Don’t worry about having few acquaintances on the road. Remember that brothers are everywhere. (Huang Jingwan) Aim high. Be down-to-earth. See and hear more. Return to your comrades. (Cai Yuanpei)</p>
<p>Ming noted that the group’s souvenirs (inscriptions) are not as complete as those of the National Walking Group. The National Walking Group’s signatures are written on a bundle of lightweight and glossy domestic white silk. It is convenient to carry and quite elegant. It is a complete whole. After returning in five years, the exhibits are displayed and nothing is missed. The group uses horizontal banners and hanging scrolls. Although there are many celebrities and literati who inscribe words everywhere, the paper shafts are heavy and inconvenient to carry, and they are fragmented and easily lost. I hope that the Asia Walking Group can adopt the National Walking Group’s inscription method.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Su Dongpo Smoked Opium Lao·Nu· <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Most poets of the past were famous for drinking. For example, Li Taibai's "A hundred poems with a bucket of wine" is especially popular. Su Dongpo's reputation as a poet is no less than that of Taibai. For example, in the Ode to the Red Cliff, "I have a bucket of wine, which I have stored for a long time." It is well known that Su Dongpo eats wine and can write poems when climbing high. I am not talking about Su Dongpo's drinking and writing poems now, but about Su Dongpo being a secret opium smoker. Isn't it a big joke to be a regular customer of Swallow's Nest? However, there is no evidence for empty talk. I have poems to prove it.</p>
<p>"Taoist persuades to drink chicken Su water. Boy can make poppy soup". Isn't this Su Dongpo's poem? Isn't this Su Dongpo's poem about smoking opium?</p>
<p>Some people say, "This is not right. If you say that poppy soup is the current opium, then 'chicken Su water' can also be said to be soda made with soda." I said, "I dare not say whether chicken Su water is soda made with soda. But it is well known that opium is made from poppy flowers. It is like the rice we eat, which is made from rice. Speaking of different names, there are various other names such as Champa jade rice. As for when opium was introduced into China, there is no clear record in history. Only in the fourth year of the Song Dynasty's Kaibao period, the Arabs and Guangzhou and Mingzhou (now Ningbo) traded with each other. Among their medicines, there was a kind of 'Mi Nang Flower', which was said to be a substance that calms the mind, increases appetite, and makes people sleep more. Later, Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty lived in seclusion in the Leopard Room for many years and never went to court. It is said that the 'Yanling Dan' he took was 'opium'." But I found a definite proof in the Piye Law. The method of taking medicine recorded in the law is the current crude opium lamp. And the word 㽼 is especially a major disease for smokers. It is said in Buddhism that Vimalakirti was the first person to smoke opium. Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty was also a famous opium smoker. Su Dongpo even called a boy to make poppy soup. The elegance is profound. The demeanor of a famous scholar. It is a good story to pass on. It can be used to defend the people in the black list. Because all the people who describe smoking have always been described as ghosts. Now, it is even more in violation of the law. Heavy punishments are used to supervise and punish them.</p>
<p>I also found a kind of evidence. Lin Zexu was a person with a great opium addiction. Because he was determined to quit smoking, the Lin Zexu ointment and pills sold in various pharmacies now are a fact that he set an example. And the Mi Nang Flower ointment produced in Meishan, Sichuan is Su Dongpo's legacy. However, Mi Nang Flower ointment and poppy soup may not be the same thing. How to eat them is probably not with the bamboo spear made by Vimalakirti, nor the Yanling Dan of Emperor Shenzong of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Billiard Chat Chun·Chao· <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Billiards is a kind of ball game. Its Western name is Billiard. It has been quite popular in China recently. Because its playing method is simple and clean, it has a kind of mechanical interest. People in the intellectual class like it very much. Ordinary people also like its simplicity and unadornedness. It is not like learning Go, where there are many rules to understand first.</p>
<p>The way to play billiards is very simple. There are four balls on the table. Two red and two white. The white one is called the cue ball. The red one is called the object ball. It is played by two people together. (Although there are three or four people playing together, it is not very common). Each person recognizes one cue ball. Then serve the ball. You must use the cue to hit the cue ball. If the cue ball touches the other two balls continuously, you score points. Touching two red and one white is 5 points. Touching two red is 3 points. Touching one red and one white is 2 points. Touching only one ball has no points.</p>
<p>Ordinary people who learn this game can score 160 to 200 points per hour with one month of effort. The sections (billiard rooms) are usually 40 points each. So it is not difficult for beginners to score 4 or 5 sections in one hour. When I was in Shanghai, I saw a Chinese man and a Western man playing this game in the Datong Hotel. The Western man once scored more than 200 points in a row with one shot. The onlookers were like a wall. After an hour, the Western man won by scoring 22 sections. At that time, I was quite surprised and thought it was a wonderful skill. Later, I heard people say that this is not surprising. In Europe and the United States, some people can score more than 1,000 points in a row with each shot. Compared to this, it is still far behind.</p>
<p>Recently, the business of billiard rooms in Beijing has been very prosperous. There are Huayuan, Huaiyuan, Quanan, Yuyuan, Dongyuan and other shops. Among them, only Huayuan's layout is acceptable. The rest are very simple. The tables, cues and balls are not top-notch. In addition, the Central Hotel and the Youth Association also have billiard rooms attached. The rent is not cheap. It costs 4 or 5 small silver dollars per hour. Dongyuan's rent is less than other shops because the location of the furniture is backward, but the customers are not very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Authorities once held a city-wide billiard competition. The champion was a man surnamed Shao. It is said that he can score 12 sections per hour. Recently, a waiter named Agou from Shanghai came to the Huaiyuan billiard room. He is from Shanghai. He played with Shao. Shao could not win. Agou had to give him half the points. It is a pity that he came to Beijing a little late. Otherwise, the championship would not have belonged to Shao.</p>

<p>Chapter 13: Who Plants Fortune Unintentionally Finds the Ring Only This Fate Heartfully Sings the Golden Thread</p>
<p>At this time, they were very puzzled. Zuo Shichen said, "I clearly remember that after taking it from Shi Guanping's place that day, I stuffed it into my long gown pocket. When the long gown was taken to be washed, it shouldn't have been taken out." His wife said, "Every time I wash clothes, I always take out everything in the pockets and put them in the drawer of your desk. I have never thrown away many things that I know are useless. I let you check them yourself. Now, there are exactly ten coupons. How could I not have noticed them and carelessly thrown them away?" Zuo Shichen said, "There's no way to find it. I'll have to tell Mr. Shi Guanping and wait until I find it before I can claim the prize." At this moment, one of Zuo Shichen's daughters, named Qing'er, who was only five years old, said, "I saw several green pieces of paper in Dad's wallet. What kind of tickets are they?" Her mother asked Zuo Shichen, "Where's your wallet?" Zuo Shichen said, "The wallet is naturally with me." His wife said, "Then Aqing said you have green tickets with you. Is it that coupon? Do you know what color that coupon is?" Zuo Shichen was reminded by her words and changed his mind. He took out the wallet from his side and looked at it. Weren't the ten Plant Fortune coupons safely in the wallet? It turned out that when Shi Guanping gave them to him, he did stuff them into his long gown pocket. Later, when he took off his long gown to work, he probably instinctively feared losing them, so he moved the things in his pockets to the wallet. But he only remembered the first time he stuffed them into his long gown pocket and forgot the second time he moved them from the long gown pocket to the wallet. If he had known this, he would have been searching for them at home. Zuo Shichen couldn't help but laugh at himself. He could really be considered a common man disturbing himself. His wife said, "Isn't that right? You hid them well in your wallet, but you came back and rummaged through them, making people search until they were covered in sweat. And they haven't made any money yet, and they have already made people's heads dizzy. It can be seen that it is not a good thing." Zuo Shichen said, "It's good to find them. Otherwise, after a busy search, they still haven't been found. If the second prize is drawn on these coupons, wouldn't that make people even more frustrated?" At this time, Zuo Shichen, after finding the Plant Fortune coupons, hurriedly took a horse-drawn carriage to Weichun Garden. Shi Guanping said, "I have already investigated. The second prize is indeed in your ten coupons." Zuo Shichen handed the ten coupons to Shi Guanping. The ten were a series of numbers. Shi Guanping counted to the third one and said, "It's here." You can take the prize back. They are going to dismantle this showroom today. We can conclude the matter about the Plant Fortune coupons. The most annoying thing about fundraising is the delay, because everyone has different jobs. This is extra work. A delay often leads to delays in sorting out.</p>

<p>(95) The Autographing Craze of Athletes</p>
<p>In recent years, as a result of Japan's special promotion of sports, the status of athletes has suddenly increased. Each company and society regards it as an honor to recruit famous athletes. The treatment is extremely good. Their ability to handle affairs is not questioned. For example, Hitomi Kinuko, a world-famous female athlete, was hired by the Osaka Mainichi Newspaper this year as a sports reporter. Her monthly salary is 500 yen per day. She does nothing all day long. Also, Takaisi Katsuo, Japan's top short-distance swimmer, was recently hired by Mitsubishi Corporation as a senior employee. There are many similar examples. People from all walks of life, based on the psychology of worshiping heroes, regard it as an honor to see the faces of athletes. Women are especially fond of it. Their ideal husband is one who is tall and burly, runs like the wind, and occupies a considerable position in the sports world. The beauty or ugliness of his appearance and the black or white of his skin are not taken into account. From the opening day of this year's Far Eastern Games until May 30, athletes from the three countries were surrounded by crowds every day asking for autographs. This can be said to be a new aspect of the conference. In Japan, the autographing craze of athletes is in full swing. The reporter once asked people in the Japanese sports world about the origin of the autographing craze. The exact date cannot be verified. It is only known that it was discovered during the Japan-Germany Sports Games last year. Since then, this trend has gradually become more popular. Until today, several days before the opening of the First Far Eastern Games, athletes from the three countries stayed together at the Japan Youth Hall. The Japanese athletes took the lead and used a pocket-sized diary to ask the Chinese and Filipino athletes to sign their names as a souvenir. Before long, our country's athletes also followed suit. Tang Baokun and Wang Xiliang, the generals of the basketball team, first asked the reporter to sign their names. Turning over their small books, there were already hundreds of signatures. Chinese, English and Japanese were all mixed together. They were carefully treasured and regarded as precious jade. After the opening, dozens or hundreds of Japanese male and female students and elementary school students scattered at the entrances of each stadium and in front of the Youth Hall, asking athletes to sign their names. There were always elementary school students around the age of ten holding broken pieces of paper and crowding in front of the athletes, asking them to write their names loudly. The situation was quite amusing. From May 16, various photos of the conference, commemorative postcards, and commemorative fans were sold in front of the Youth Hall. The craze for autographs became more intense. People were looking for the athletes themselves to sign their names on their own photos. Even the conference staff and overseas Chinese could not escape the custom. The front of the door was crowded with people. The road was blocked. They were all crowds asking for autographs. The famous Ms. Sun Guiyun, Liu Jingzhen, Huang Shufang, Gao Zi and other ladies were even more noticed by the general public. The number of times they were surrounded was also the most. At first, Sun Guiyun did not easily sign autographs for people. Once, a certain student studying abroad held a commemorative fan and asked Sun to sign it. Sun looked at him coldly and said, "What is the meaning of your actions?" The student was embarrassed and could not answer. So he stopped. The next day, Zhang Yongjing, a cadre of the Youth Association, also asked Sun to sign a photo. Sun thought that Zhang had been in charge of the reception for a long time and had worked hard, so she nodded in agreement. But she said that this was actually the first time she had ever signed an autograph. The onlookers heard this and asked her to sign their names one after another. Under heavy siege, Sun had no way to refuse. So she held a pen and wrote freely, responding to each request one by one. In a short time, she signed her name dozens of times. It was also an interesting story in the autographing craze. As a result, the athletes' actions were greatly inconvenienced. The traffic in front of the Youth Hall could not be maintained. After discussion by the cadres of the Sports Association, a strict order was issued on the morning of May 28 to prohibit athletes from signing autographs. A large notice was also posted in front of the Youth Hall, writing the ten characters "Requesting athletes to sign autographs is absolutely not allowed." For a time, this trend was slightly suppressed. But it was still found near the Outer Garden of the Meiji Shrine. It is because this kind of fashion has been deeply imprinted in the minds of the Japanese people and cannot be shaken. Once, the reporter accompanied Zhang Yongjing, a cadre of the Youth Association, to a banquet hosted by a Japanese friend. More than a dozen geishas were invited to the banquet. For a time, there was powder and flowers, the songs of swallows and orioles, soft singing, and laughter filled the room. The Japanese friend jokingly said that the reporter was a sprinter of the Chinese athletes' delegation and Zhang was a high jump master. Before he finished speaking, all the beauties arrived. Zhang was tall and had long legs. Everyone measured him with their jade hands and said, "Indeed, he is a high jumping genius." They took out their bone fans and handkerchiefs and asked us to sign our names. For a time, we were unable to defend ourselves and reluctantly scribbled. The crowd happily dispersed and sat down. Thinking back to this scene and this situation, I can't help but laugh.</p>

<h3 id="e177">The Gold Market Resumes a Downward Trend <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The waves have calmed down slightly, but people are still confused. Yesterday, the 31st, the gold market resumed a downward trend, and the storm seemed to have subsided. However, there were still three or four taels of hidden volatility, and the overall market still had a difference of thirteen taels. In the morning, it once reached eighty taels, but in the afternoon it suddenly broke into the seventy tael range, suddenly reaching sixty-six and a half taels, and people were still confused. The foreign exchange listing also shrank by half a point, but internally it was loose, which means that the light and dark are different, and the market is still busy with buying and selling. However, the major players were brave in selling, such as Yuan Maoyong, Xin Heng, Da Decheng, and others all sold off, while the buyers were mostly retail customers. The large bars in the morning market shrank slightly and were not moved, instead trending downward. Later, due to the activity of buyers, especially because Xianling had news of shrinking listings, they saw an increase. Coupled with the brave selling of major players, it quickly turned into a downward trend, falling by as much as ten taels. Later, the buyers in the afternoon market regained the majority, but at first they were weak, and then gradually improved, estimating a rise of six or seven taels, and finally settling between seventy-three taels. Yesterday, the silver market shrank slightly by one-sixteenth, and the silver price also fell by one-eighth.</p>
<p>The morning market opened with a drop of three taels. The opening price of September gold was five hundred and seventy-seven taels and eight qian, which was already a drop of three taels and eight qian, followed by another drop of one tael and seven or eight qian, totaling six taels and one or two qian. Then, Yuan Cheng Yong and others bought in, and the price was pushed up four taels to eighty taels. After a while, it went back two taels. Xianling opened at seventy-eight taels and one qian, shrinking one or two five. The US dollar shrank by two jiao and a half, and the Japanese gold added one point, so it rose to seventy-nine taels and seven or eight qian. Later, Yongheng, Yongfeng, Fuchang, Hengxing, and others all sold off, and the market situation suddenly became stagnant. The exchange rate was also loose. Mitsui issued September Japanese gold at one tael, three qian, one point to one tael, three qian, zero seven five. So it fell sharply, until after eleven o'clock it fell to seventy-one taels. Because Zhifeng Yong and others chased in, it pulled up three taels to seventy-four and a half taels. After eleven thirty, the selling pressure did not stop, and it suddenly broke through the seventy tael mark, estimated at sixty-nine taels and eight qian, and immediately exited the market, adding two taels, which was a multi-party pull to settle the price. At noon closing, it was estimated at seventy taels and eight qian.</p>
<p>The afternoon market was even more sluggish, with a total drop of eight taels. The afternoon market opened at sixty-eight taels, because the goods had already been lowered first. Then Yuan Xing Yong and others bought in, and it rose to sixty-nine taels. Suddenly, it lost three taels, because Fuchang and Yuanheng sold off, and it suddenly fell to sixty-six taels. At 2:10, the arbitrageurs scrambled to buy, and the price soared by five taels. At 2:45, it was seventy-one taels. Then, because the Indian exchange rate increased by two ounces, Hengxing and Yu Da took the opportunity to sell, so at 3:15 it retreated to sixty-eight taels. Later, Xianling also rallied, and Sumitomo absorbed September at 6.75 pence, and October at 8.125 pence. Then, only 6.75 pence (October) could be sold. Especially Hengxing and others scrambled to buy, and it soared by more than five taels. However, there were twists and turns of two taels. Until after 4:15, it reached seventy-three taels. In an instant, it was suppressed by one tael, and the closing price was seventy-two taels, a drop of eight taels compared to the day before, which was the opposite of the three-day rise.</p>
<p>The settlement price was slightly lower than seventy taels. The maximum price during the day was eighty taels, and the minimum price was sixty-six taels, with a difference of thirteen and a half taels. The price was changed to six hundred and forty-two taels and six qian, which was one point higher for the Japanese gold listing. At first, it was suppressed to sixty-three or four taels, and the noon closing was seventy-two taels. In the afternoon, it was reduced to seventy-two or three taels to seventy-six taels, and then back to seventy taels, registered at seventy taels to seventy-one taels, with a water supplement of seventy taels. In the afternoon, it was seventy-two taels, and the goods opened at seventy-seven taels, closed at noon at sixty-nine taels, and in the afternoon at sixty-eight taels, closing at seventy-two taels.</p>
<p>The arbitrage bars were first sold and then bought in. According to the transactions of each firm, Xie Yu, Chunfa Yong, Fushun, Yuanheng, and others all bought in. Yuan Maoyong, Yuan Xingyong, Xin Heng, Da Decheng, Hongli, Taikangrun, Fuyu, Fuchang, Yu Da, and others all sold off. Yuan Chengyong, Wanxing, Shunli, Zhifengyong, Hengxing, Yongfeng, Xufengrun, and others had uncertain ups and downs. The arbitrage bars were all sold off, and then bought in in the afternoon. Yongfeng, Da Decheng, Yuan Xingyong, and Yong Chengchang all bought in. Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Yuan Maoyong, and Yu Da occasionally had deposits and withdrawals. Yuanheng, Xin Heng, Yuancheng, and Tian Yuyong all sold off. The Dalian gang sold off a total of 1,300 to 1,400 bars, and bought in 800 to 900 bars. The Guangdong gang had a balanced outflow and inflow in the morning market, and a considerable number in the afternoon market, about 3,000 bars in total, which were roughly balanced.</p>

British gold transactions amounted to over 100,000 pounds, with 100,000 pounds sold, and Mitsui, Sumitomo, and other banks taking in tens of thousands of pounds each through interbank trading. US dollar trading was rather sluggish, while a small amount of Japanese gold was settled.

<h3 id="e180">Silver Dollar Market Busy at Month's End <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the scheduled end of the month, and the transactions for the entire month were generally summarized. Therefore, the busyness of the settlement procedures on that day goes without saying. Because an investigation was impossible, the results are temporarily omitted. The market price of silver dollars in the market was 7 mace 2 fen 8 li 2 hao and a half in the morning and 7 mace 2 fen 8 li and a half in the afternoon, slightly better. Silver short-term lending was 3 fen in the morning and 2 fen in the afternoon. Clearing was still done in white. Foreign exchange drafts made out totaled 1.71 million in the morning and 1.07 million in the afternoon. Banknotes were 10,000 in the morning and 50,000 in the afternoon. In addition, 49,000 new Zhongshan coins were added at 0625 over the market price. Customer orders were approximately 200,000 to 300,000, with the source unknown. Bank buying and selling amounted to 350,000 in interbank trading in the morning and 650,000 in the afternoon. The silver dollar public order settlements of money shops were also too numerous to estimate and are omitted. Small money shops traded over 700,000 in banknotes. In the subsidiary currency market, Jiangnan small silver dollars took the opportunity to rise sharply. The morning and afternoon prices both opened at 6 mace 3 fen 7 li, an increase of 3 li compared to the afternoon price of the previous day. The transaction volume was 4,500 jiao in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon.

<p>Although the trend of silver availability in July felt loose in the first half of the month, it was not excessively so. The daily rate stood at over 1 qian, and although there were some days below 1 qian, efforts were made to maintain the status quo and prevent excess. The second half of the month was even worse, with some white borrowing occurring. Therefore, the total amount of silver short-term lending for this period was far less than in June, at only 2 liang 4 qian 6 fen, averaging 8 fen 2 li per day. Compared to the 5 liang plus of the previous month, this was less than half. As for the proposed deposit interest rate, it is expected to be around 2 liang 5 qian, discounted by 95%, which will be noted to observe the future.</p>

<p>Yesterday, various bond markets were filled with selling pressure due to tense current affairs and weak public sentiment, causing bond prices to fall steadily. Compared to before settlement, Customs Duties futures decreased by 1 yuan and 56 jiao, and Reorganization and Disbandment of Troops and Post-War Rehabilitation also fell by over 1 yuan. Other bonds also uniformly fell by about half a yuan. Only the Continued 2.5% futures were slightly firmer. Observing the bond market situation, it seems that the decline will continue. The total daily spot trading was only 9,000 yuan, while the futures market was not quiet. The morning session saw over 4.7 million yuan, and the afternoon session approximately 2 million yuan, for a total of approximately 6.8 million yuan.</p>

<p>Customer Sales Show Brisk Atmosphere</p>
<p>Real sales in the yarn market are picking up, with customer groups actively purchasing. The Sichuan and Guangdong customer groups are making excellent purchases, and sentiment is good. The market trend is becoming more favorable, and buyers' attitudes are particularly strong. However, the overseas cotton yarn market is still weakening. Nevertheless, the current demand for yarn is very high, and the market should naturally stabilize. If real sales continue, there may be a price increase of two to three liang. The price of yarn for distant months must be watched at 160 liang. The bottom stock of 10-count yarn is relatively depleted, but various factories have stocks of 16-count and 20-count yarn. The sales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd brand yarn are even more sluggish, it is said.</p>
<p>Auction Yarn Slightly Firmer in the Morning, Slightly Softer at Noon. Before the auction, the market opened with good sentiment and strong buying pressure. The market was still tight, and prices rose by 3.5 qian. In the afternoon, some long positions were closed, and sellers added more, causing prices to fall by 3, 4, and 5 qian. The total daily transaction volume was 15,300 bales. Taichang sold the most, at 1,000 bales. Heshenda, Jiyu Long, Shenchang, Qinfeng, Shenji, Yichang, Yongchang, Lichang, Yiyu, and Ruida sold between 400 and 1,150 bales. Dachangcheng bought the most, at 2,150 bales.

<p>US Cotton Gradually Finds New Low Prices, Sales Decline, Inventory Approximately 6 Million Bales. The Weather is Favorable for New Cotton. Therefore, Japanese Merchants Expect a Price of 11 Cents. However, the Local Cotton Market Has Not Been Affected Much Because the Weather Is Cloudy and There is Fear That Windstorms Will Continue, and Buyers Are Holding Tight. However, Some Speculators Are Selling Large Quantities in Distant Months, With Very Large Bale Amounts, It is Said.</p>
<p>Cloudy Weather, Buyers Still Strongly Pulling on Hankou Cotton. The Hankou cotton market opened in the morning, with buyers still strongly pulling due to bad weather, and prices rose by 5 fen to 1 qian in each month. The afternoon was flat.

<p>US Cotton Southern Selling Softens Further Yesterday, US cotton initially fell due to speculators selling, and then weakened further due to good Western forecasts and Southern selling. Futures fell by 17 to 20 points, and spot prices fell by 20 points. British cotton futures fell by 6 points, and spot prices fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 5 points.

<p>Various Groups Compete for 15,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice sales were sluggish in the morning, and the market was weak. Only 3-4,000 bags of each type of rice were opened, and everyone was bearish. In the afternoon, the inland groups from Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Xiashi, as well as the Yantai group, began to load medium-grade and lower-grade goods. Although the Hankou group returned a large amount of low-grade rice, they slightly loaded nearly 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice yesterday. Various groups competed for it, and the market price immediately rose by 3-4 jiao. The transaction volume also increased. A total of 14,000-15,000 bags were opened in the market, with the afternoon accounting for 70%. If various customer groups continue to order tomorrow or the day after, the market will definitely stabilize. Small broken rice and coarse rice saw the most transactions yesterday, totaling 5,000 bags, priced at 11 yuan 7 jiao to 10 yuan 7 jiao and a half. Gai rice had 3,500 bags, priced at 14 yuan 3 jiao to 13 yuan 9 jiao and a half. Large broken rice had 3,000 bags, priced at 12 yuan 3 jiao to 11 yuan 8 jiao and a half.

<p>80,000 Bags Delivered via Warehouse Receipts</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for the settlement of standard flour for July. The actual delivery by various factories included 68,000 bags of Red and Blue Car brands from Fufeng and Yutong, 4,000 bags of Green Three Stars brand from Zhonghua, and 8,000 bags of Green Eagle Ball brand from Tailong, for a total of 80,000 bags. It is said that this type of warehouse receipt delivery is partly due to poor customer sales and concerns about the accumulation of spot goods, and partly because prices were raised too high, making delivery necessary. As for those who took delivery, it is said that they were certain customers. However, with sales to the north suspended and distribution difficult, they may suffer some losses in the future. The transaction volume of futures was significantly lower than in June, totaling 7,741,000 bags.</p>

<p>Highest Price Since the European War</p>
<p>Rapeseed oil sales always peak in the summer because candle production stops and it is exclusively supplied to soap factories. In the past, when our country did not have soap factories, summer was considered a slow period. Since the advent of soap factories, although candle production stopped due to the hot weather, oil sales were not sluggish. This is also a history of market changes. In recent years, soap usage has increased daily, causing summer business to be more prosperous. This year, the winter rapeseed harvest was poor, resulting in a sharp decrease in production. After the start of summer, foreign firms in Hankou and Shanghai have been buying in large quantities, resulting in a state of scarcity. The Hankou telegram the day before stated that soap factories had bought several hundred dan of Macheng oil at a price of 17 taels 2 qian, while Shanghai firms had bought at 17 taels. Today, a detailed letter states that Jingzhi and Jin areas are out of stock. Macheng oil has risen to 17 taels 8 qian, and there is not much stock left. Further purchases may require over 18 taels. This is the highest price since the European War, it is said.</p>

<p>Textile transactions returned to quiet yesterday, mainly because the ports in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River are once again unsettled. The Changsha group sent a telegram to stop loading. The Hankou, Shashi, and Jiujiang groups are also waiting and watching, so there were not many transactions yesterday. The street is in a slow period and is even more lifeless. Cloth prices have been significantly affected. The Yuehua velvet from the Eastern goods has already shown signs of turning from rising to falling. Fine serge in dark colors from Tingyi is softening. Cotton French velvet is also down by 2.5 li. Concubine-colored Yang Guifei has been sold for 1 qian 7 fen, and Bird Beauty's large red is 1 qian 8 fen 2 li and a half. The Shuilang velvet, in which the Sichuan group was unusually active, also fell yesterday, with Shuanglong at 2 qian 1 fen, Jiaoye Tishu at 2 qian 5 li, and Yang Guifei at 2 qian 7 li and a half. Only bleached cloth is still firm, with Tiansi Golden at 9 taels 1 qian, Fushou Three Stars at 9 taels 5 qian and a half, and Western Queen Mother at 11 taels 5 qian. Western goods have been in a state of transition recently. Summer goods have reached the end of their season. Autumn goods, after being lively for a while, have become quiet again, so there were not many transactions yesterday, it was said.</p>

<p>New orchid bamboo branches produced in Zhangzhou had a poor harvest this year, and very little arrived after the market opened. Therefore, the previous price had opened as high as 29 taels. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived from Xiamen, with a total of over 400 boxes, of which orchid bamboo branches accounted for more than half. The increase compared to before is sudden, and the market price is expected to ease slightly. However, land prices are still firm. It is expected that trading can begin tomorrow, it is said.</p>

<p>Pickled Mustard Tuber Supply Not Continuing</p>
<p>Yunnan large-headed mustard tuber has not arrived for a long time, and market inventory is quite scarce. The current market price is 48 yuan, and most shops have no stock to sell. Sichuan pickled mustard tuber is also unable to be supplied due to obstructed supply lines. The customer inventory here is only over 3,000 jars. Recently, the price opened at 37 yuan to 34 yuan. The shop inventory is even lower, approximately 2,000 jars. The current sales are still good, with the wholesale price at 36 yuan and the subsequent price at 32 yuan. The trend is stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port still showed no upward trend. The silk weaving factories in Lyon are currently trying to reduce costs, and silk prices are not high. The telegram price is small, and European firms are also hoping to hoard at low prices, making transactions difficult. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others brought in 30 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, and Dachang brought in 10 bales of white dry silk. Prices were both firm, it was said.</p>

Recently, due to the nationwide earthquake, there is no hope for autumn silkworms, and Italian silk has gradually turned higher. The sales of Double Special grade to France has slightly moved, with the price rising by 3 lire, and the price of Special grade rising by 2 lire, it was said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port saw a trend of active sales from US firms. Jinlong, Yihuo, and other firms, as well as the China Tea Company, have all begun operations. However, with silver prices low by two to three taels, several large firms on the main road are also in negotiations. Gongxi green tea from the Russian Cooperative Association and Baitou Zhuang have large purchases, and transactions are not sluggish. Yihuo, Xiehe, and other firms also have a high demand for Zhenmei and Xiumei. The above-mentioned green teas are not difficult to sell. Only Zhenmei remains sluggish in the market. The recent hoarding is visibly abundant, which is a concern for tea merchants, it was said.</p>

<p>This factory's wire nails were very prosperous in Henan and Shanxi in the past. There were negotiations and inquiries almost every day. Recently, due to the uncertainty of the war, those groups have not been inquiring, and the market is very cold. The Hankou and inland groups are also unable to calculate profits due to the high bottom prices, so there are very few transactions, almost as rare as stars in the morning. The current market price is 6 taels 1 qian and a half per barrel. According to an investigation by various dealers exclusively distributed by Quan Shen, the current daily sales volume is only about 270-280 barrels. This situation is truly the cold era for this factory's nails.</p>

<p>With foreign exchange rates continuously declining in recent days, the cost of various hardware goods has quietly increased significantly. Therefore, various dealers have again discussed raising prices in order to maintain the market and make up for the losses. As a result, the market sentiment is good, and everyone is raising their buying prices by two to three qian. Customer deliveries will also begin in the coming days, so the market trend is very optimistic.</p>

<h3 id="e276">Kelun Hospital Specializes in Treating Venereal Diseases <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>Venereal diseases are terrible and frightening, lurking within the human body and breaking out when the opportunity arises. During this hot and humid weather, syphilis, chancroid, gonorrhea, buboes, and fish mouth are rampant. Every year, every month, and even every day, countless people lose their lives, and even more pass it on to future generations. This invisible killer is far more devastating than visible water, fire, knives, and weapons. Unfortunately, people often fail to notice and indulge in sensual pleasures. Once infected with venereal disease, they are careless and unaware of the need to eradicate it early. By the time the poison has deeply accumulated and the limbs are crippled, they are shocked and seek medical treatment, but they do not know how to choose a doctor, resulting in being harmed by quacks, which is very pitiful. Kelun Hospital (opposite the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road), in view of this, for the sake of personal happiness, for the sake of social health, and for the development of the entire nation, loudly calls out and specifically warns patients not to avoid medical treatment and to quickly come to this hospital for diagnosis and treatment. However, patients often do not know the symptoms and signs of the disease, so we have specially described the various symptoms and harms of venereal diseases in detail below, so that readers know and patients know how to seek medical treatment and choose a doctor, so as not to disappoint the hospital's careful warning.</p>
<p>(Syphilis) Initially, only small hard nodules, redness, swelling, and ulceration appear on the glans (or on the labia majora and minora in women). This stony hard nodule is called a hard chancre. At this time, the bacteria have not yet spread. After a few days, buboes appear between the hips, with hard swelling and slight pain, indicating that the bacteria have gradually entered the whole body through the blood vessels. This is the first stage of symptoms. If you do not seek treatment immediately, the spread will become more extensive and reach the terrible second stage. At this time, the whole body is weak, the joints are sore, red rashes appear on the face and body, sore throat, red eyes, headache, stomach pain are present, it is worse at night, hair falls out, and the nails become deformed. If treatment is not appropriate, it will turn into a dangerous third stage. In the third stage, the internal organs rot, rubbery tumors appear all over the body, the limbs are paralyzed, the voice is hoarse, the eyes are blind, the ears are deaf, and the bridge of the nose collapses, leading to death. The cruel state is difficult to describe in writing. Our hospital uses various scientific methods to treat this disease and is responsible for eradicating it. In addition to using 606, 914 and other injections, we also use the latest invented secret agent sulfonamide and other methods to completely eradicate syphilis of any stage in the shortest period of time, ensuring that the blood test will never have after-effects.</p>
<p>(Gonorrhea) is the most common venereal disease, but it is also the most difficult venereal disease to eradicate. Treatment is often ineffective, lasting for many years, causing lifelong harm and hindering reproduction. This disease initially only secretes a kind of pus from the urethral opening, and patients often do not pay much attention to it. Later, the pain gradually increases and even bleeding occurs, and then they panic and seek medical treatment, but they do not know that it has become a serious acute gonorrhea. If the treatment is still not appropriate, orchitis, prostatitis, gonorrheal arthritis, gonorrheal eye disease, etc. will inevitably occur, which can damage the internal organs and harm the five senses, and also turn acute gonorrhea into chronic gonorrhea. Not only are specialists available, but it can also be guaranteed that there will be no obstacles to fertility. Initially, white turbidity reduces in three hours, pain stops in seven days and recovery occurs. Chronic old white turbidity is eradicated in two weeks and will never recur.</p>
<p>(Chancroid) is divided into hard and soft chancroid. Hard chancre is the initial stage of syphilis. Soft chancre is the most serious local disease of the genitals. Initially, men develop a white ulcer on the penis, and women develop it on the labia, secreting pus and causing pain, and the ulcer becomes larger and larger until it is uncontrollable, even to the point of rotting away the entire reproductive organ. The pain and cruelty are unmatched. Our hospital uses a new scientific injection method that can immediately relieve the pain after one injection and achieve success in three to five days, ensuring no after-effects. We dare to say that it is the only effective treatment for chancroid and is definitely not comparable to those who boast without knowledge.</p>
<p>(Buboes and Fish Mouth) Buboes mostly occur with syphilis, gonorrhea, chancroid, etc. Those that initially occur with syphilis are painless buboes. Thereafter, they gradually swell and become larger, the pain gradually increases, and walking becomes difficult. If the disease progresses further, it will suppurate and break, with pus and blood dripping out, and its shape is like a fish opening its mouth, hence the name fish mouth. Although this disease comes on quickly, it is very slow to heal, and the pain suffered by the patient is more severe than any other external disease. The medical method of our hospital is different from others and can definitely relieve the pain with one injection and achieve success with three injections. If it has not suppurated and broken, it can also be guaranteed that it will not ulcerate but will disappear invisibly. Outpatient consultation is one yuan. From 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. Sundays as usual. Address: Opposite the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road. Director Zhang Kelun, Physician.</p>

<h3 id="e278">The Recent Turkish Literary Scene 明· <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Because the Turkish Republic government is striving for national rejuvenation, it has gradually awakened many long-dormant activities. Therefore, it is expected that Turkish literature will soon become very active. At present, efforts in this area are still mediocre, but such efforts can be said to be the beginning of better harvests. It can be asserted that a country like Turkey will definitely produce good literature. This ancient country in the Near East has a beautiful and dramatic historical background, filled with colorful legends and folk literature, which are the materials for excellent national literature, although the Turks still do not value their treasure of folk literature.</p>
<p>However, the inability of Turkish literature to develop also has its reasons. Because if Turkey wants to make its literature flourish, it must first solve the significant problem of illiteracy. Currently, there are five million people in Turkey who cannot read or write. The government's current universal education movement provides some basic education to 500,000 adults each year, but even at this rate, the huge project of the "literacy movement" cannot be completed in less than ten years.</p>
<p>Since Turkey adopted the Latin alphabet more than a year ago, more than 1,000 books have been printed using the new phonetic spelling method, 80% of which are school textbooks. In addition, in terms of literature, there are 40 novels, 30 collections of children's stories, and 15 collections of poems. As for the number of writers, although it is said that it has increased since the abolition of the Arabic script, they cannot find publishers because of the difficulty in selling new phonetic spelling books. For example, for novels, the sales of old-style writing were already not good. The number of copies printed for each type is probably from 200 to 2,000, but very few can sell more than 500 copies. "The Wren" by Reshad Nouri is a Turkish book,</p>
<h3 id="e279">The Best-Selling Book <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>Since its first publication in his youth, it has sold about 25,000 copies so far, but this book has never been reprinted in the new script because reprinting it in the new script would mean no sales.</p>
<p>Therefore, writers have repeatedly asked the government to provide some subsidies to encourage the construction of new literature, but the government has always refused. However, the Turkish Ministry of Education has recently contacted the French Hachette bookstore and agreed to provide financial assistance from the government in the first year if the bookstore can add management offices for selling books, magazines, and newspapers throughout Turkey. The purpose of this plan is to expand the sales of books because, at present, the Turkish reading community is completely concentrated in the big cities. 80% of Turkish books are absorbed by the four major cities: Istanbul accounts for 30%, Ankara accounts for 25%, Smyrna accounts for 20%, and Samsun accounts for 10%. The remaining 20% is scattered in three small cities.</p>
<p>The book business is still mostly based on books printed in Arabic script. There are still inventories of this type of book. As for books in the new script, sales are really not great because the older generation, who read for entertainment, would rather look at the old-style script. Only students are used to reading books in the new script. However, a new Turkish dictionary has recently been published, containing 30,000 new script words spelled with Latin letters. This dictionary is certainly very useful.</p>
<p>Because of the small number of literate people, the level of culture in Turkey has never been popular, so the publishing industry in Turkey has never been developed. The bookstores are full of dusty pamphlets, which are printed using a stencil duplicator method. Each page is inserted with meticulous brush paintings, like Persian miniature religious paintings. And because of the shortage of paper, paper is used very economically. The densely packed text of each book is diagonally written on the bottom edge of each page, making the words in a book messy, and unclear. These books are bound with soft paper covers, and each book sells for about one or two dimes. All the old-style novels in Turkey are printed like this, and these novels are well-known and almost memorized by everyone, such as "The Minstrel," "Shayi Si Mei" (SbabIsmaiI) "The Minstrel You Mo" (EumertbeMinatrel) "Jiu Luo Qiao" (Kiucogion) "Lena and Medlong" (LeyIaandMedjooun), "Jilin and Ashley" (keremandAsli), etc. The status of these books in Turkey is the same as "Bishenghua," "Zaishengyuan," "Zhengdong," "Zhengxi," "Yu Qingting," and "Shuangzhufeng" in our China.</p>
<p>But this traditional literature is now greatly declining. Compared with those new-style novels that have been published in the past few years, the sales volume is quite different. However, most of these new-style novels are imitations of European romance novels. The structure is ordinary, the content is superficial, and they have no literary value. Moreover, these novels are often published in newspapers day by day, so they are procrastinating, lengthy, and tasteless, which is similar to our newspaper novels.</p>
<h3 id="e280">There are no outstanding figures among Turkish modern novelists. <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>Hussein Rahmi, Hassan Djemal, and Reshad Nouri all have a portion of readers, and their influence is comparable. Among Turkish novels that have been translated into foreign languages, only "The Wren" has been translated into German. Reshad Nouri (the author of "The Wren") is popular because of his simple style, which is simple and natural, without the traces of Persian-Arabic influence, and is indeed unique.</p>
<h3 id="e281">"The Wren" <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>is the story of a girl, Meride, who, because she was angered by her fiancé, ran away to Anatolia to teach. The tone of this novel is very slow. It describes in detail Meride's childhood and teaching experience. The monotonous and silent life in the Anatolian countryside is like a vivid picture unfolded between the pages of this book. At the end, Meride returned to Istanbul and married her lover. The author, Reshad Nouri, is a prolific novelist. Among his famous novels are "From Lips to Heart," "Stain," and "Secret Hands."</p>
<p>In the Near East, modern romance novels have replaced ancient mysterious literature. Only those scholars are working hard to preserve the philosophical texts and poems of ancient monks and hermits, because these things have become antiques. As for the tastes of the Turkish reading community, that can be measured by looking at one thing. Among the foreign literature translations in Turkey, the most popular is Zola's "Loyalty" (Verjte), and "Loyalty" is a very "romantic and sensual" novel.</p>
<p>Many Western literary classics have been translated using new letters because European literature is welcomed by a large number of people in Turkey, and this is indeed a commendable thing because the introduction of European literature will undoubtedly have a good influence on the Turkish literary scene. As for Turkish folk tales, because they have been passed down from generation to generation for hundreds of years, very few have been printed into books. Even if there are, they are only printed into the kind of pamphlets mentioned above. Naseddirl Kbodja, a comedian from the era of Emperor Timur, is luckier than others in folk legends. A pamphlet of 80 pages, recounting his life deeds, has recently been published, tracing his childhood, student days, youth, the era of being a judge, and the era of old age. Last year, a bookstore in Turkey printed a book in new letters, dedicated to the stories of this comedian and fabulist. However, there are really too many of his stories in the legend. This is only a very small part of them.</p>
<h3 id="e282">There is also a very familiar figure in Turkish folk literature, <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>Karagoz. Legends about him will also be preserved in the same way. The person doing this work is Professor Selim Bey of Robert College. The stories of this famous figure, in addition to being written into puppet show scripts, have never been printed. Only a German oriental scholar, Doctor Rettor, published a well-printed illustrated book a few years ago, which collected several puppet show scripts centered on Karagoz, but that was not purely "Karagoz stories." Selim Bey's goal is to record the Karagoz stories of folk legends without modification, so it can be considered an important work in Turkish folklore. It is only a pity that, in order to facilitate popularity, the editor tried his best to eliminate these</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>obscenities in the stories, so that it would not be offensive and would not hinder the spread, but the true face of these stories was therefore cut off in part. Karagoz was a comedian who lived in the era of Sultan Orhan, who did many strange things and later became a famous figure in legends. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e285">Hanging Branches Tune - Li · Substitute · Hua · <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>I once said that "Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection" is a very good collection of folk songs. Now, the "Hanging Branches Tune" I'm about to discuss is also a book of equal value.</p>
<p>"Hanging Branches Tune" contains forty-one folk love songs, and it is said to be the work of Feng Youlong, a talented and uninhibited man of the Chongzhen period of the Ming Dynasty. However, some people doubt who the author really is. Zheng Zhenduo once cited a passage from Shen Defu's "Gu Qu Za Yan" to prove that "Hanging Branches Tune" was not created by Feng, but was actually one of the popular folk songs. Shen Defu's "Gu Qu Za Yan" says:</p>
<p>During the Jiajing and Longqing periods (嘉隆間), the practice of singing "Wu Geng" (五更) and "Yin Jiao Si" (銀絞絲) became popular. From the Huai River region to Jiangnan, it gradually drifted away from Ci and Qu poetry, only depicting lewd and obscene situations, with a slight variation in tone. In recent years, there have been two more tunes, "Da Zao Gan" (打棗乾) and "Hanging Branches Tune" (掛枝兒), whose melodies are roughly similar. Therefore, regardless of north or south, male or female, old or young, noble or lowly, everyone learns them and enjoys listening to them. They have even been published in volumes and are recited all over the world, deeply touching people's hearts. No one knows where the scores come from, which is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>From this perspective, the claim that Feng created it seems difficult to establish. Moreover, from another perspective, Feng Youlong was originally someone who liked to revise the works of others, such as "Liang Jiang Ji" (量江記) and "Yi Peng Xue" (一捧雪) (renamed "Feng Liu Meng" 風流夢), which, together with over ten other plays in "Mo Han Zhai Chuan Qi" (墨憨齋傳奇), added "Ping Yao Zhuan" (平妖傳) and other novels, such as "Zhi Nang" (智囊), "Qing Shi" (情史), "Xing Shi Heng Yan" (醒世恒言), "Jing Shi Tong Yan" (警世通言), "Yu Shi Ming Yan" (喩世明言), etc., were all proofread and adapted by him. As for the forty-one love songs in "Hanging Branches Tune," their exquisite beauty is naturally unmatched by purely folk songs. It is evident that they have been embellished by the hands of scholars. Therefore, it is more believable to say that "Hanging Branches Tune" was originally a folk song, collected and modified by Feng.</p>
<p>Although "Hanging Branches Tune" and "Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection" both sing about the affairs of men and women, "Hanging Branches Tune" is more subtle and implicit in its depictions of sexual desire and kissing and hugging than "Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection." For example, even when the book describes more direct flirting, it is not crude:</p>
<p>Darling, I care about you so much, I wish I could swallow you into my stomach with a bowl of water. I think about you every day, I long for you every day, but it's no use. I pluck up the courage to kiss you, thank goodness, you don't refuse. If I had known you wouldn't refuse, why did I wait until today to do this?</p>
<p>Flirting (1)</p>
<p>Compared with songs like "Lover Loves Me," "Jade Beauty," and "Happy to Be Happy" in "Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection," this is naturally much more nuanced and delicate. As for "I wish I could swallow you into my stomach with a gulp of water," this is a purely folk saying that is very popular. I remember hearing a tune like this:</p>
<p>Oh, my, oh, my, when I was little, I looked like an ugly pig. I can't sleep at midnight or in the early morning. I think of it, during the day, the handsome young man passes by the door. He passes by the door, and a mouthful of cold water goes down my stomach.</p>
<p>As for whether she later plucked up the courage to kiss him like in the flirting song, I unfortunately didn't hear the end. However, I always feel that many folk songs are similar to this. Moreover, the more popular a folk song is, the more different it is in different regions. However, these differences are not completely different in their main points. Instead, due to local customs and dialects, they are different on the surface but similar in essence. When we compare and study this "Hanging Branches Tune" with "Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection," we find that several songs are the same. It can be clearly seen that they originated from the same source. Here are some examples:</p>
<p>The pretty girl points her finger at Du Kang and scolds him, you made wine because of beauty, and made me, the wronged one, drunk. You come in and fall into my arms, regardless of who sees you, luckily my husband is not at home. Oh, you greedy-for-beauty and fond-of-wine wronged one, you treat your life as a joke.</p>
<p>| Scolding Du Kang (Hanging Branches Tune)</p>
<p>I hate it so much I want to scold Du Kang, he made the fine wine and made the wronged one drunk. He got so drunk that he talked nonsense and scolded me. He couldn't stand still and bumped into my arms. I'm glad my husband isn't home. If he were home, this mess would be bigger than the sky. Call, lover, take a lantern and go back.</p>
<p>| Hating to Start (Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection)</p>
<p>Melon seeds are not rare, wrapped in a handkerchief and given to my dear brother. Each one has been on the tip of my tongue. The gift is light, but the meaning is heavy, good things don't need to be many. Please give my best regards to my dear brother, and don't forget me.</p>
<p>| Giving Melon Seeds (Hanging Branches Tune)</p>
<p>Melon seeds are not a rare item, wrapped in paper and handkerchief, and given to my dear lover. Good ones don't need many, one is equal to one, and each one has been on the tip of my tongue. I advise my lover to eat them, and don't forget me, don't forget me.</p>
<p>| Melon Seeds (Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection)</p>
<p>Therefore, when we study folk songs, if we can work hard to collect and compare the slightly different versions from various regions, we will surely increase our interest and make more new discoveries. Moreover, we can see their original faces. However, many of those who collect folk songs still only know how to select one or two of the better ones from the many slightly different songs and consider themselves satisfied. The rest are discarded like worn-out shoes and are not cared about. In this way, there will be no good results for folk songs. Furthermore, the collection of folk ballads and stories may also have this problem. I hope that those who work hard in folk literature will recognize this point.</p>
<p>"Hanging Branches Tune" has more songs about objects than "Bai Xue Yi Yin Continued Selection." Among the forty-one songs, there are as many as seven: "Lotus Dewdrop," "Zongzi," "Mirror," "Golden Needle," "Bound Feet," "Curtain Hook," and "Xiao." However, each song contains subtle and intricate double meanings, which are extremely interesting. For example:</p>
<p>Lotus dewdrop, the precious leaves reveal my infatuated heart, using thread to string them together. Who knew you would be so fickle, scattering here and there and gathering there. Oh, you heartless wronged one, following the wind and turning.</p>
<p>This way of expressing one's emotions through singing about objects is so natural and so moving. Let's look at this song about the golden needle, which uses hidden metaphors in its words:</p>
<p>Golden needle, I love you with all my heart, hoping to thread you through. How can you know, when we meet occasionally, how can I bear to abandon you? I often tease you, don't you think your heart is made of iron?</p>
<p>If only a thread could connect, it would not be in vain to work with you.</p>
<p>This kind of game of using "needle" (針) to imply "truth" (眞) and "sew" (縫) to imply "meet" (逢) has always been very popular in China. For example, in ancient poems, "hibiscus" (芙蓉) implies "husband's face" (夫容), "lotus" (蓮) implies "pity" (憐), "silk" (絲) implies "thought" (思), and "tombstone" (碑) implies "sadness" (悲). In addition, there are many examples in Liu Yuxi's "Bamboo Branch Song," such as "The sun rises in the east and rain falls in the west, it is said to be cloudless but there is love" (東邊日出西邊雨、道是無晴却有晴), where "cloudless" (晴) implies "love" (情). As for songs and ballads, there are even more uses of hidden metaphors. For example, in the Cantonese folk song, "After the rain, the spider still spins its web, wanting sunshine, one can only think in secret" (雨後蜘蛛還結網、想晴惟有暗中思), "sunshine" (晴) implies "love" (情), and "silk" (絲) implies "thought" (思), which is a very good example. In short, this kind of metaphorical comparison always uses the borrowing of objects or the similarity of sounds to express inner emotions.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel that folk literature is the crystallization of national thought and the expression of the common heart of a nation. It expresses the characteristics and national spirit of this nation. At the same time, it allows us to see its strengths and weaknesses, and to reform, enlighten, guide, and support them, so that they can reach a glorious and splendid realm day by day.</p>
