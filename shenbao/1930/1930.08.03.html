<p>○白里安簽約造成新記錄籌</p>
<p>法國外交總長白里安氏因代表法國與名國訂立條約經其親筆簽字者已達二百三十六種之多故於外交史上實已造成簽約之新記錄而其最足驚人之處則在爲時之短今且賡續其訂約之職責焉</p>
<p>查白里安所簽訂之第一約距今猶不及十年該約爲法比二國間關於礦工恩給金之支配繼之者則有一九二一年十月之安哥拉條約及同年十二月之華盛頓條約均關太平洋事宜嗣後所有法國之國際公約莫不經白氏之手簽訂如道威斯及楊格計畫等然均用法國之名義而由白氏充代表耳至於以白氏個人之名義訂約者則僅凱洛白里安條約而已該約之正式名稱則爲巴黎條約仍非其個人名義也其爲人類謀幸福之條約</p>
<p>則有國際限制軍械營業及毒瓦斯施用等約</p>
<p>至其主張和平消弭戰禍尤足令人欽佩白氏自就任外長以來即與各國訂立公斷及友好條約已簽訂者有西班牙葡萄牙土耳其芬蘭和蘭美國丹麥波蘭巨哥斯拉夫等僅德俄二國尙未有成約之希望云</p>

<p>西瓜則又反乎香瓜之性矣蓋蔓愈長則其所生之瓜愈甜西瓜方熟時必須翻易其處以就日曬則全瓜得光均而甜味亦均瓜田蓄水尤須調匀調匀則瓜大而美每遇雨打風傷發見萎藤即當摘去否則萎病蔓延必礙及瓜之生長也瓜上常有細小斑疤係螢等小飛蟲吮嘬之跡非特無礙於瓜且爲瓜美之特徵無論西瓜香瓜於其生産時宜注意求其質之美不應但求量之多故常宜巡視畦間不時摘去其累贅之瓜則餘瓜必大而美</p>

<h3 id="e8">Another French Plane Lands in Italian Territory <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Previously, a French plane flew into Italian territory and dropped anti-Fascist leaflets, causing a diplomatic dispute. Italian newspapers were very angry and denounced France as the source of anti-Fascist plots. Italian-French relations were on the verge of breaking down. Unexpectedly, today there is another incident of a French military plane being forced to land in Italian territory. According to the telegram, the Italians found only machine guns and no bullets on the plane. The military officer piloting the plane claimed that he was blown off course by a storm and ran out of fuel, so he could not return to his country. This situation is also reasonable in principle. However, viewed by those with resentment, it is unknown what kind of angry arguments will be made again. The plane has already been confiscated and the two military officers are still in custody awaiting investigation. We will wait and see what the outcome will be.</p>
<p>The discord in Italian-French relations stems from competition in the Mediterranean and rivalry over territory, coupled with ideological contradictions. As a result, even though Britain, the United States, and Japan reached a compromise at the London Conference, the dispute between Italy and France has become even more apparent. The Fascist Party's consistent theory is that the Mediterranean is our sea. Lands previously abandoned must be restored, and the excess population must seek colonial outlets. Only then will its traditional and consistent policy be achieved. They also regard French liberalism as an obstacle to the development of individualism, denounce France's tolerance of political criminals as a haven for anti-Fascist fugitives, and constantly suspect and restrict the expansion of its power. They blame France's security policy as inappropriate. Therefore, their newspapers often use small problems to express passionate opinions, and French newspapers also launch tit-for-tat attacks. The degree of discord is becoming more and more serious. Yesterday, the British monarch declared in Parliament that he hoped that Italian-French negotiations would be resolved satisfactorily in order to complete the Five-Power Agreement. We, observing the recent events between Italy and France, know that it is far from hopeful.</p>

Last night, the police refused to allow the National Congress to march through the police cordon and enter the European business district for demonstrations. The protesters then squatted on the wet ground facing the police. This standoff continued until this morning, when the police asked Beiter to urge the crowd to disperse, or else the leaders would be arrested. Beiter and five others voluntarily surrendered. The crowd then dispersed, leaving only two or three hundred people who refused to leave. The police finally used batons to disperse them. About one hundred people were slightly injured. This demonstration was to commemorate Tilak, a leader of the National Congress who died in 1920.</p>

<p>Russo-Japanese Fishing Disputes Intensify. National News Agency, Oslo, 1st: The Norwegian government is planning to convene an international conference to resolve the issue of sovereignty over certain islands in the Arctic Ocean. This is because recently, a Norwegian ship in the bay near Franz Josef Land was forced by a Soviet Russian fisheries patrol ship to sign a declaration acknowledging Soviet Russian sovereignty over the island before being ordered to leave. Therefore, they want to invite relevant countries to confirm sovereignty.</p>
<p>Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 2nd: According to sources in Vladivostok, the fisheries conflict between Japan and Russia in the North Pacific is intensifying.

<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 1st: Today is the anniversary of the declaration of war in 1914.

For example, in Paris, people worked as usual, and the number of demonstrators in the streets was less than the number of police and Republican Guards. Even in Helsinki, Finland, although Communist activists distributed leaflets at night urging workers to rise up in opposition to the Lappo Movement, the day passed peacefully.</p>

<p>Nippon News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: Continuous heavy rains, floods, and landslides have caused widespread damage throughout Japan. More than 2,000 houses in Tokyo have been flooded, and 3,000 houses in Osaka. Rivers are rising rapidly throughout the country, and coastal areas are at risk of tsunamis.

<p>Completion Expected Tomorrow</p>
<p>Government Decides on Response</p>
<p>Den Tsushin, Tokyo, 2nd: The preliminary review of the arms reduction treaty by the Privy Council has been slightly delayed and will not be completed until Monday. The subsequent review committee will focus on legal deliberations, but the core of the discussion will be on reducing the burden on the nation. Expanding the air force beyond the limits in order to supplement national defense shortcomings will only make the name of reducing the burden meaningless. Furthermore, the United Kingdom and the United States may also expand their air forces in response, resulting in a situation where countries openly compete to expand their military capabilities outside the provisions of the treaty. It remains to be seen how Finance Minister Kurahei and Navy Minister will respond to this point.</p>
<p>Nippon News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: After yesterday's regular cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Foreign Minister Kijuro, Finance Minister, Justice Minister Eki, Director-General of the Legislation Bureau Kawasaki, and Chief Secretary Suzuki gathered in the Prime Minister's office to discuss the government's response to the Privy Council's deliberations on the London Treaty. As a result, the government decided on the following policy: (1) The Prime Minister himself will explain the process and results of the London Treaty to the Privy Council's first formal review committee. (2) The three ministers, Hamaguchi, Kijuro, and Finance Minister, will attend the review committee. Hamaguchi will answer questions on constitutional issues and matters under the jurisdiction of the Navy Minister. The Navy Minister and Foreign Minister will each answer questions on matters under their respective jurisdictions. (3) The content of the Naval Military Advisory Council meetings will not be answered. (4) Answers regarding the Naval Military Advisory Council's report will be rejected. (5) Prime Minister Hamaguchi and other cabinet members will hold meetings at any time to discuss how to deal with the Privy Council's future situation.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Martial Law Declared in Hankou <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Wuhan Military Camp believes that the security of the rear is of utmost importance during this period of military operations. It has ordered the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters to strictly enforce martial law. In addition to the Wuchang and Hanyang districts, which have already been ordered by the Headquarters to cut off traffic after 12:00 AM every night, the Hankou district will also officially declare martial law starting today (August 1st). The Garrison Headquarters' notice is recorded below: (1) Wuhan is an important town on the Yangtze River, and it is also a time of military operations. According to the order of the Commander-in-Chief of the Wuhan Military Camp, martial law will be enforced in the Wuhan Garrison Area. In addition to the fact that Hankou is a special commercial field and martial law is being carried out covertly, traffic in the Wuchang and Hanyang districts is completely cut off from 12:00 AM every night until dawn the next morning, etc., and has been specifically ordered to be followed. Subsequently, at the 16th meeting of this Headquarters on July 29th, after proposals and endorsements from various garrison agencies and troops, it was resolved that the entire Hankou district should be requested to follow the example of Wuchang and Hanyang districts and completely cut off traffic from 12:00 AM every night until dawn the next day. This Headquarters has submitted a document to the Commander-in-Chief of the Wuhan Military Camp for review and approval, and has now received instructions stating that it has been approved. Starting from August 1st, traffic in the Hankou district during the martial law period will be completely cut off from 12:00 AM every night until dawn the next morning. The area around Liujiamiao Jiang'an and the area around the German-Chinese School and the upper street of Qiaokou will be cut off from traffic from 9:00 PM every night until dawn the next morning. Soldiers and officers who are traveling on official business must display the license plates or flags of their respective agencies or troops on the front of their vehicles, and when approaching guard posts, they must slow down, stop their vehicles, and only be allowed to pass after the guard post soldier or police officer has answered the password correctly or has inspected and verified the pass. In addition to issuing a notice to be strictly enforced in compliance, a notice is hereby issued for the military, civilians, and others to abide by it. (2) It is found that the variety of amusement venues is complex. Even with close supervision during peacetime, it is easy to cause trouble. During martial law, it is even more inappropriate to open night markets that gather thousands or even tens of thousands of people in one place. It is easier for bandits to hide in the chaos, making it more difficult to prevent and investigate. This Headquarters bears the full responsibility for garrisoning the area and should take precautions in advance in order to ensure thorough planning and security. A notice is hereby issued to all managers of the amusement venues to comply with the order that night markets are not allowed to open until martial law is declared lifted. Anyone who dares to deliberately violate the order will be arrested and prosecuted. (August 1st)</p>

<p>Situation of Martial Law in the Provincial Capital</p>
<p>A Nanchang dispatch states that when the 18th Division's 52nd and 54th Brigades recovered Xingan and Zhangshu, Huang Gonglüe, Luo Binghui, and others split into two routes and fled. One route fled along the east bank of the Gan River towards Le'an in Fuzhou, while the other fled west across the Gan River to Gao'an. However, Gao'an is only 120 *li* from the provincial capital and only has a small number of Peace Preservation Corps troops. As a result, on the evening of the 26th, the county seat fell to the bandits. Commander-in-Chief Lu and Division Commander Zhang, upon receiving the news, immediately telegraphed the 52nd Brigade to pursue towards Gao'an from Zhangshu. They also transferred the 107th Regiment of the 54th Brigade back to the provincial capital from Zhangshu, which then took small boats across the Gan River to Shengmi to advance towards Gao'an and suppress the bandits. At the same time, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also ordered the Second Security Team to station themselves at Wanshou Palace, 30 *li* from the city (a necessary route from the provincial capital to Gao'an), to provide defense. According to reconnaissance reports yesterday, the bandits in Gao'an actually only number slightly over a thousand, but they are making a false show of strength, claiming to be 20,000 strong. Yesterday, the bandits held a meeting in Gao'an to kidnap and extort ransoms. In the provincial capital, since the loss of Gao'an, people have become more anxious than on the 24th and 25th. In reality, the defensive works, electric fences, and trenches around the city are extremely solid, making it impossible for the bandits to fly across. Commander-in-Chief Lu reported at the provincial government's weekly memorial service yesterday: "All important places are garrisoned with heavy troops, and the security of Nanchang can be absolutely guaranteed. I hope the citizens can rest assured. As for the defensive works of the provincial capital, they are extremely thorough. Only a small number of soldiers are needed to defend them, and the majority can be drawn to the front lines to suppress the bandits. The communists are all a bunch of rabble. Peng Dehuai was a stable boy under former Independent Fifth Division Commander Zhou. Zhu De is a disgruntled military man. The so-called Chairman Mao Zedong of the Communist Military Commission is a normal school graduate. He once said to people in Guangdong, 'I only need 20,000 or 30,000 yuan and I will not revolt.' How can such an idea be considered revolutionary? It would be a real joke if we were frightened by this bunch of people." At the moment, the provincial capital has issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting the fabrication of rumors and the creation of disturbances. All amusement parks in the city have been uniformly closed for business. From 10:00 PM every night to 5:00 AM the next morning, all traffic is completely cut off, and no one is allowed to pass without a special pass. In order to unify propaganda, the Martial Law Headquarters held a meeting of reporters from various newspapers in the city yesterday to report on the reasons for this martial law and to establish a news censorship office to inspect all news items. All newspaper reporters were issued passes to facilitate their movement. It has just been reported that Li Baobing's brigade, sent by Director He to Jiangxi for joint defense, has already arrived in Jiujiang. The 52nd and 54th Brigades, which set out from the province to Gao'an, have arrived in the Shengmi and Wanshou Palace area. After hearing the news, the communist bandits in that area are extorting everywhere, preparing to flee elsewhere. At the same time, Fengxin is also sending an urgent plea to the provincial authorities, but it is unknown if it is the same group. (July 29th)</p>
<p>○The Lower Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Have Emerged from Dangerous Works; Puyang is Also Reporting an Emergency</p>
<p>A Jinan dispatch states that since the beginning of the *fu* period this year, continuous torrential rains have created a situation of flooding. The Shandong River Affairs Bureau has recently received repeated reports of dangerous works from upstream and downstream. According to a report from the Luokou section, as of yesterday (the 27th), the water level continues to rise and has now risen to 9.4 *zhang* above sea level, with a continued rising trend. The danger line at that location is 9.3 *zhang*, and the water is only 0.26 *zhang* below that level. If the current situation can be maintained during the day, Jinan will not experience dangerous works. However, dangerous works have already emerged on the north and south banks of the downstream. According to a report from the River Affairs Bureau as of the 26th, there are four locations reporting dangerous works: Wang Wangzhuang in Putai County and Fengjia on the south bank, and Sunjia in Lijin County and Wang Zaojia in Huimin County on the north bank. Li Guojun, director of the River Affairs Bureau, recently requested the provincial government to allocate funds for rush repairs during the *fu* period. Deng Chongxi proposed a discussion at the first provincial affairs meeting, and it was decided to provisionally allocate 120,000 yuan to be shared by the 59 counties along the river. However, this amount cannot be fully disbursed at once, so the River Affairs Bureau consulted with the Finance Department to have the bureau raise the funds and the department reimburse them to meet the urgent need. The River Affairs Bureau has now borrowed 20,000 yuan from the Bank of China and 10,000 yuan from the High Court and will immediately distribute them to facilitate the rush repairs. As for the upstream, there are no dangerous works in this province, but the Liuzhuang stone dam in Hebei Province has experienced dangerous works. The construction there is in Hebei, but the harm is in Shandong. There are a total of twelve stone dams in Liuzhuang, and the tenth and eleventh dams have experienced dangerous works and are in a very critical state. The Puyang County government recently telegraphed the Shandong River Affairs Bureau to report this and requested an allocation of 240,000 yuan of funds borne by Shandong to meet the urgent need. According to previous decisions by the provincial government regarding the special river works at the Liuzhuang stone dam, Shandong Province would provide 240,000 yuan annually, with 120,000 yuan borne by the provincial treasury and 120,000 yuan borne by the eight counties of Caozhou, with the River Works Committee overseeing the completion. After the changes in Jinan, no one is responsible for the River Works Committee, and the funds are also without source. After receiving the urgent telegram from Puyang County, Li Guojun, director of the River Affairs Bureau, immediately telegraphed this situation to the Hebei River Affairs Bureau, requesting urgent measures for rush repairs. The Shandong funds will be discussed further. (July 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e71">Anti-Banditry Conference in the Eight Counties of Xuzhou <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>A Xuzhou dispatch states that Song Runtian, the Xuzhou Garrison Commander, convened an anti-banditry conference in the Garrison Headquarters at the Garden Hotel on the 31st, after being ordered to concurrently serve as the anti-banditry commander of the eight counties, and invited representatives from the eight counties to attend. The meeting began at 1:00 PM, and attendees included Yang Weifeng, magistrate of Tongshan County; Fang Qingping, representative of Feng County; Zheng Yunqiao, representative of Su County; Wang Enpu, representative of Yangshan; Liu Guorong, Ding Jishi, and Zhu Bichen, representatives of Suining; Jiang Quansheng, representative of Suqian; Luo Yuanye, magistrate of Pi County, etc. The representative of Pei County was absent. Miao Zhensong, chief of staff of the Garrison Headquarters, and Meng Hongsheng, secretary, were also present. Commander Song chaired the meeting. First, Song reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that he hoped that the counties would work together to clear out bandits, and that the communist party was manipulating the bandits. If the bandits are defeated, the communists would also be defeated. The following twelve items were discussed and resolved: (1) Each county should report the number of districts, the number of militia firearms in each district, and the overall current defense situation in detail (2) Each county should report the organization, strength, and number of firearms in the police force, as well as the deployment situation in detail. (3) Each county should submit a list of the names, ranks, and seals of the county magistrate, public security bureau chief, police brigade commander, and district chiefs. (4) Each county should report the bandit-producing areas, villages, and towns, as well as the names and numbers of the bandit leaders and bandits in detail. (The above information will be provided in forms prepared by the headquarters.) (5) If small-scale bandit incidents occur in any district of each county, the district chief should convene the members of the local militia to be responsible for suppressing them. If the strength is insufficient, they may join forces with neighboring districts to assist in the suppression and report it to the county magistrate. (6) If banditry occurs simultaneously in several districts of each county, the district chiefs should jointly be responsible for suppressing them. The county magistrate may also send a police team to assist in the encirclement and suppression, but false reports should not be made to avoid wasting military force. (7) Regarding passwords and signals, the headquarters will stipulate and issue them, and the flags and armbands will be designed by the headquarters, and each county will manufacture them for its own use (but only for use during bandit suppression). (8) Regarding rewards and punishments for those who contribute to bandit suppression, if there are extraordinary contributions, the county magistrate may report them to the headquarters for submission to the higher authorities for rewards, subject to approval. (The regulations on rewards for captured firearms and ammunition will be announced separately.) (9) The methods of compensation for officers and soldiers killed or wounded in bandit suppression will follow the peacetime compensation regulations promulgated by the central government. (10) The expenses for the establishment and operation of the joint office, public funds, and food expenses for office staff will be prepared by each county and approved by the meeting. (11) In addition to the representative from each county in Xuzhou stationed in Xuzhou, the office should have a clerk, two scribes, and messengers. Salaries should be stipulated and paid monthly. (The above two items will be coordinated by the headquarters.) (12) Each representative will hold a regular meeting once a week. If special circumstances occur, meetings may be convened at any time. Finally, Secretary Meng suggested establishing joint bandit suppression regulations for implementation. The meeting adjourned at 3:00 PM, and the representatives returned to their respective counties. (July 31st)</p>
<p>○Methods for Promoting Financial Bonds in Guangdong Province; Unredeemed Banknotes Will Also Be Redeemed</p>
<p>A Guangzhou dispatch states that since Guangdong Province decided to issue 15 million yuan in financial treasury bonds, the Department of Finance has recently formulated methods for promoting sales. Once issued, over 5 million yuan in unredeemed banknotes can be recovered in August and September, and a certain type of unredeemed banknote can be redeemed in the third month. An investigation of the promotional procedures and budget is as follows: (A) The allocation method is divided into four items: (1) Sales allocated to wealthy households in each county. (2) Sales allocated to Guangzhou, Shantou, and stores in other cities that have previously obtained business licenses, at 3% of the business license capital. Commercial banks and silver firms are allocated at 5%. (3) Sales allocated to shops in Guangzhou and Shantou based on one month's rent. (4) Sales allocated to contractors of *li*, tax, and donation revenue under the Department of Finance based on half a month's worth of their payment amount. (B) The sales-linking method is divided into three items: (1) For merchants paying national and provincial taxes, as well as *li*, tax, and donation revenue in counties and cities, 20% of the tax amount is linked to sales. (2) Twenty percent of the fines from the judicial, administrative, and national tax agencies of Guangdong Province are linked to sales. (3) Twenty percent of the daily expenses of national, provincial, and municipal schools under the judicial, administrative, and national tax agencies of Guangdong Province are linked to the monthly budget. All of the above items, except for sales-linking methods two and three, which are unrelated to the central government's banknotes, can use central government banknotes to pay in installments based on the order of payment, at the following rates: 50% for payments made in August 19, 30% for payments made in September, and 20% for payments made in October. An investigation of the allocation method shows that it is limited to two months for the full amount to be raised. Therefore, averaging the payment of central government banknotes at 40%, the second category of the allocation method, commercial licenses, is estimated to be allocated approximately 3 million yuan based on an average of 4% of the capital amount. Using 40% of central government banknotes, approximately 1 million yuan in central government banknotes is required. The third category, rent, is allocated approximately 800,000 to 900,000 yuan, requiring approximately 300,000 yuan in central government banknotes when calculated at 40%. The fourth category, half a month's worth of revenue for each contractor, can be allocated approximately 1 million yuan, requiring approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan in central government banknotes when calculated at 50%. Furthermore, the first category of the sales-linking method, various taxes in the provinces and cities, will link sales at 20% of the tax amount and require approximately 800,000 yuan in central government banknotes each month. In addition, the first category of the allocation method will allocate sales to wealthy households in each county, and using an average payment of 40% in central government banknotes, the amount required will be significant, estimated at approximately 5 million yuan in central government banknotes between August and September. Based on the actual calculation of supply and demand, the market price of central government banknotes can rise to over 90%. At the same time, the Department of Finance will take the opportunity to devise a way to first redeem a certain type of unredeemed banknote. (July 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Civil Law <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Points for the Chapters on Inheritance and Family (Continued) Opinions of the Central Political Council's Review</p>
<p>(2) Preliminary Points for Family Law: Point 1: Classification of Relatives. Relatives should be divided into three categories: spouse, blood relatives, and relatives by marriage. (Explanation: The old laws of our country divided relatives into clan relatives, maternal relatives, and marital relatives, which originated from the clan system. It is necessary to make a fundamental reform in the current situation. The occurrence of kinship is based on either blood or marriage. Therefore, the classification of relatives should be defined as three categories: spouse, blood relatives, and relatives by marriage. Blood relatives and relatives by marriage should be further divided into lineal and collateral relatives. This classification is not only natural but also in line with the legal systems of the world. Point 2: Surnames between spouses and children: (1) As a principle, the wife should adopt the husband's surname, and the husband should adopt the wife's surname when entering her family as a son-in-law, but exceptions may be provided. (2) Children take their father's surname. (3) Children of a son-in-law take their mother's surname, but exceptions may be provided. (Explanation) This problem can be assumed to be the following six options, and their strengths and weaknesses can be studied: (1) Both spouses use an agreed-upon surname (the husband's surname, the wife's surname, or a third surname), and the children follow suit. (2) Both spouses use their own surnames, and the children combine the surnames of both parents. (3) Both spouses use their own surnames, the sons take the father's surname, and the daughters take the mother's surname. (4) The wife takes the husband's surname, and the children take the father's surname. (5) The husband takes the wife's surname, and the children take the mother's surname. (6) The wife adopts the husband's surname, and the children take the father's surname. The first, second, and third options are in line with the principle of gender equality, which is their strength. However, if the first option is used, spouses have the freedom to choose a surname, and children also have this freedom when they marry, which may result in frequent changes of surname. Then, the reason for having a surname is only superficial, which is its weakness. If the second option is used, it is not impossible for children to combine two surnames, but the children of children will have more than two characters in their surname, and the number of characters will increase with each generation without limit. This is also its weakness. If the third option is used, the surnames of brothers and sisters will be different, which is somewhat strange, which is its weakness. The fourth option, where the wife does not retain her own surname but takes the husband's surname entirely, seems somewhat biased. The fifth option is equally biased and is not advisable. In the sixth option, the wife can retain her own surname, and the husband will not change his surname. In practice, it seems easier to implement. As for the surname of the children, since there is no other perfect solution, it is proposed to continue to follow the father's surname. However, this refers to the situation where the wife marries into the husband's family. If the husband enters the wife's family as a son-in-law, the husband will adopt the wife's surname, and the children will also follow the mother's surname to show some intention of gender equality. Therefore, it is proposed to set this as the principle. Whether to set another exception (for example, if the spouses have another agreement) can be discussed at length by those responsible for drafting the provisions. In general, there is no perfect solution to achieve complete gender equality in this matter, as mentioned above. Since gender equality is difficult to achieve perfectly, other forms of equality, such as economic equality, political power equality, and private rights equality, should not be pursued in vain. If it is necessary to make the surnames perfectly equal, it is very difficult. However, within the possible scope, it should aim to comply with the principle of equality. Point 3: Scope of Relatives. The scope of relatives should not be specified, but the definition of relatives and the method of calculating degrees of kinship should be specified. (Explanation) The relationship between humans giving rise to kinship has a distinction between blood relatives and relatives by marriage, and the scope of blood relatives and relatives by marriage is originally difficult to determine. In terms of blood relatives, from parents to grandparents and so on, going upwards, and from children to grandchildren and so on, going downwards, there is already a connection of blood. Even if the generations are far apart, it cannot be said that they are not relatives. The same is true for lineal relatives, and also for collateral relatives. In terms of relatives by marriage, there is no fixed scope, just like blood relatives. The scope of relatives stipulated by law is because relatives sometimes have a legal relationship with each other, and in fact, it cannot be unlimited. Therefore, it is stipulated to facilitate application. However, the circumstances of various legal relationships are different, and the scope of the regulations should also vary accordingly. Therefore, even if a general regulation is forcibly made, when encountering special legal relationships, such as the prohibition of marriage between relatives in civil matters, the duty of support between relatives, and the rights of inheritance, and in criminal matters, the aggravation of punishment and kinship relationships, it is still more practical to stipulate their scope separately. Therefore, there is no need to make a general regulation on the scope of relatives. However, since the classification of relatives has been fundamentally reformed and divided into blood relatives and relatives by marriage, it is not easy to understand what their definitions are without clearly defining them in writing. Since blood relatives and relatives by marriage must be distinguished according to their closeness in special legal relationships, it is necessary to calculate their closeness in terms of degrees of kinship. Therefore, the definition of relatives and the method of calculating degrees of kinship should be stipulated. Furthermore, the methods of calculating degrees of kinship are divided into two types: Roman law and monastic law. The method of calculating degrees of kinship in Roman law is to count up and down from oneself in a direct line, with one generation being one degree of kinship. In a collateral line, count from oneself to the person of common origin, and then count down from the person of common origin to the relative in question, with the total number of generations being the number of degrees of kinship. The method of calculating degrees of kinship in monastic law is the same as Roman law for direct relatives, but not for collateral relatives. Count from oneself to the person of common origin, and then count from the relative in question to the person of common origin. For those whose generations are the same, the number of generations on one side is used to determine the degree of kinship. For those whose generations are not the same, the larger number is used to determine the degree of kinship. This is the difference from Roman law. Most countries in the world use Roman law. The calculation of Roman law is based on the distance of blood relation to determine the degree of kinship, which is in line with reason. Monastic law originates from Western religious traditions, and its calculation of degrees of kinship does not fully follow the proportion of closeness. For example, if the number of generations in two lines is different, the larger number is used to determine the degree of kinship, so the line with fewer generations often does not distinguish between superior and inferior and is of the same degree of kinship, which is not reasonable. The reason why our country previously adopted monastic law was because it was relatively similar to the ancient clan mourning system, and all clan relatives within the five degrees of mourning could be covered by the four degrees of kinship under monastic law without omission. Therefore, from the draft of the Civil Law of the Qing Dynasty to the most recent drafts, all have used monastic law to calculate degrees of kinship. Now that the classification of relatives has been fundamentally reformed and divided into two major categories, blood relatives and relatives by marriage, it is no longer related to the so-called mourning system. We should choose the best and change to Roman law. (To be continued)</p>

<p>This year's autumn harvest in the counties of southern Anhui is abundant, and the price of rice is gradually falling, with ordinary rice costing about 13.50 or 13.60 yuan per *shi*. Yesterday, the Wuhu Municipal Office, the Wuhu County Government, the General Chamber of Commerce, and other agencies held a special meeting at the General Chamber of Commerce. The foreign rice and local rice sold by the Price Stabilization Committee have all been sold out, and there is no need to continue to stabilize prices. It was decided that all four price stabilization bureaus would uniformly cease price stabilization today (the 1st), and the Price Stabilization Committee would also prepare to dissolve.</p>
<p>The Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce and others have learned that communist bandits have been discovered again in Guangde, Nanling, and other counties. They telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief's Office and the Capital Garrison Headquarters to retain the stationed troops. Yesterday, they received a reply stating that the headquarters attached great importance to Wuhu's security. The Third Battalion is approved to remain in Wuhu, and there are plans to divide and suppress the bandit troubles in Ningguo and Guangde, to consolidate the rear. The bandits who robbed the Huangmu Ferry in Nanling County are still entrenched in the vicinity of the Ma Ren Ferry area and have not fled elsewhere. Yesterday, the Wuhu County Garrison and the nearby militia surrounded and attacked them, and a fierce battle lasted for several hours. The passenger and cargo ships traveling from Nanling to Wuhu were blocked by the shelling. Later, fearing that the authorities would increase reinforcements, the bandits began to flee towards Fanchang. The Nanling shuttle boat only arrived in Wuhu today.</p>
<p>Xi Qisi and Xiang Xiaoliu, the commissioners of the Ministry of Interior, and the Jiangsu and Anhui provincial governments for surveying the Jiangsu-Anhui provincial boundary of Dangtu and Danyang Lake, returned to Wuhu yesterday after completing the survey. Due to the disagreement among the Jiangsu and Anhui commissioners, the disputes were difficult to resolve. They have now gone to Beijing with Jiang Zhongya, magistrate of Dangtu County, to resolve them. (August 1st)</p>

<p>Threatening Letters Arrive Like Snowflakes: Previously, there were rumors of Tai Bao Ashu fleeing into hiding, disbanding the gang. After detailed investigations, it was learned that Tai Bao Ashu did indeed secretly arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday and made some connection with other gangs. His position as fake commander has been temporarily entrusted to Jin Fei as his agent. He is still hiding in Qianjiaxu Township. The bandits are led by their respective leaders under his command, and Jin Fei is quite obeyed by them. It is estimated that there are more than ten small gangs, each with more than thirty people. Therefore, the total number is still several hundred. They are lurking near various townships and appear and disappear unpredictably. For example, the group in Nanlu is led by Xu A'jin, the group in Shanqing Port is led by Zao Shi A'quan, the group in Liujiaqiao is led by Zhu Luo A'mei, and the group in Shejiao Bridge is led by Wu A'zhao (who led the charge with the flag during the looting of Xincang). The groups in Dianxia Bridge and Zhuanjiao Bay are led by Lu Yaosheng and Yan Shusheng. The other bandits' residences must also have bandit leaders leading them. Although the military police have repeatedly searched and suppressed them, they often get wind of it in advance and avoid capture, so it is rare to capture them. As a result, they are becoming increasingly rampant, and robberies are occurring repeatedly. Recently, the practice of extorting loans has become even more widespread. These people send out dozens of threatening letters every day, delivered by their armed accomplices. At first, they would choose relatively well-off families, but now they extort loans from everyone, regardless of their wealth. Those who are extorted are mostly peaceful farming families who are too busy with plowing to move, so they have no choice but to let them be slaughtered under threat. Some have been extorted several times, resulting in the complete loss of their property. It is especially pitiful. Furthermore, any women who are slightly attractive are often kidnapped by them when passing through bandit dens. As a result, people fear them like tigers.</p>

<p>Maple Ridge Bandit Leader Executed: Jin Haiqin, the Maple Ridge area and his family of seven were burned to death by the Communist Party in 1927. The culprit Wang Ziqin was executed last year. There was also a leading bandit named Gu Guilong who escaped and has been wanted with a reward ever since. He was captured in Shengze last month and escorted to Songjiang. After interrogation by the county government, the bandit confessed to being the chairman of the Communist Party, and could not remember the number of kidnapping and murder cases he had committed in order to raise funds and purchase guns. The family members of the victims also identified the bandit in court, and the bandit fully confessed. Even while in hiding, he secretly directed everything, causing the bandit atmosphere in Maple Ridge to be very rampant. Recently, he bought several boxes of guns for 3,500 yuan and distributed them to his followers. His crimes are heinous, and the people of Maple Ridge hate him to the core. The county government received a confidential telegram from the provincial government approving the death penalty and the county government immediately (the 2nd) took the bandit leader Gu Guilong, verified his identity, and tied him to the execution ground at Yu Huang Pavilion for execution by firing squad.</p>
<p>High Court Orders Release of Prisoners: Zhang Peicheng, the county's warden, recently received an order from the High Court that the prisons are overcrowded and must be cleared. Those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for less than one year and have served more than half of their sentence may be released on bail in accordance with the bail regulations. The warden immediately made a list and submitted it for approval.</p>
<p>Farmer Threatened by Bandits: Cai Yisheng, a farmer in the southern part of Xihu Tang, a farmer in the southern part of Xihu Tang, only cultivates dozens of *mu* of rented land and has no savings. One night at the end of last month, at about 10 p.m., he heard a frantic knocking on the door. When he asked who it was, he was told they were borrowing something. As soon as the door opened, he saw four burly men. One of them, wearing a black Indian silk gown and a box gun hanging on his chest, asked, "Where is the head of this household? Our army lacks funds and needs to borrow 2,000 yuan. Send it to the unit by the fifth day of the month. If you can't raise the money in time, we'll give you ten days, or we'll kill and burn your house to the ground." After hearing this, the farmer was terrified and at a loss of what to do.</p>

<p>Hengsha Flood Disaster Exceptionally Severe: The sixth district under this county (namely Hengsha) is a sea island surrounded by protective embankments to prevent flooding. The Jiangyin Nanqing Academy has a lot of farmland there, so it specially appointed Dai Hanyun as the rent collector. This spring, a water hole was discovered in the outer embankment. The local residents went to the rent collector to request repairs, but Dai ignored them. On the 29th of last month, a sudden typhoon caused the sea water to surge, resulting in the collapse of the embankment. More than ten residents were drowned and more than six thousand mu of fields and houses were turned into swamps. The victims are in a very miserable state, eating in the wind and sleeping in the open. Afterwards, they went to the rent collector to question him. Seeing the unfavorable situation, Dai even resorted to a demonstrative act. The unarmed victims left in disappointment. Now, the district elder, Hu Shaobo, has convened local people to organize a flood relief committee to save the people. On the morning of the 2nd, Xu Mingbo, the police captain sent by the county, and Zhang Zhenpei, a staff member of the Construction Bureau, rushed to the disaster area to investigate everything.</p>
<p>Investigating the Absconding of the Construction Bureau Director: Li Jingzhao, the director of the Construction Bureau of Chuansha County, absconded with public funds on the 16th of last month.

<p>Lake Bandits Secretly Purchase Firearms in Shanghai: The Provincial Security Department recently received a report stating that three or four hundred bandits from the Haizhou gang in Shanghai have gathered and boarded more than ten ships to go to Taihu Lake to join the gangs of Mao Zilong, Zhou Asi, Lao Ba, Chen Lai, Song Zigao, Guo Ziying, etc., planning to gather and cause trouble, and collude with Yangtze River pirates to plunder firearms everywhere. Furthermore, the bandit leader Li Desheng secretly purchased dozens of Mauser pistols in Shanghai to supply the gangs. After receiving the report, Director Li Mingyang ordered the Water and Land Public Security Teams to strictly prevent and block them. In addition, Gong Guoliang, the temporary commander of the Taihu bandit suppression, personally led his team to Taihu on the 31st to command the various troops to advance and suppress them according to the opportunity. After the bandits who kidnapped the Dongshan small wheel fled, the bandits initially sent a letter to the people of Dongshan Town demanding 500,000 yuan, which has been reduced to 300,000 yuan. However, the families of the kidnapped victims do not have such a large amount of money, so they have to request Commander Gong to find a way to rescue them.</p>

<p>Make-Up District Chiefs Will Not Be Made Vacant: The Suzhou Civil Affairs Department stated that the reason for the transfer of district chiefs from various counties to the province for make-up studies was because of their immature abilities or improper actions, and they needed to supplement their academic positions in order to cultivate sound talents. Previously, during the make-up study period, the district chief vacancies in various counties were feared to be without qualified personnel to fill them temporarily, so specific rules for the selection and use of district chiefs were specially formulated to provide relief. According to these rules, the personnel selected are temporarily acting district chiefs. If the members of the transfer province have excellent results after completing the make-up study, they should return to their original districts and continue to work as before. Director Hu specially ordered the county magistrates of various counties not to vacant the district chief positions of those who were transferred to the province for make-up studies. If there are still graduates from the first and second sessions of the district chief training institute in various counties who have not been assigned as district chiefs, they should select the best ones to fill them. If there are not enough, they should be selected in double the number according to the selection and use rules and reported for circle approval.</p>

<p>Zhongshan Park Will Be Managed by the Municipal Government: Since the summer of the 16th year, Ningbo Zhongshan Park has been established by Commander Wang Jun, who contacted local gentry and merchants to initiate the establishment of a fundraising committee. More than 100,000 gold was needed from preparation to completion. After completion two years ago, the fundraising committee was cancelled and a management committee was organized. All income and expenditure in the park were the responsibility of the committee. It has been calculated that there is still a construction fee of more than 16,000 gold. The committee was unable to repay it, so it specifically held a meeting yesterday to resolve it and send a letter to the municipal government to take over the outstanding construction fees, which were also allocated and paid by the municipal government.

<h3 id="e91">This Year's Welsh Children's <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Global Broadcast Answers</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education Issues a Circular Announcing the Answer Contents, Approximately Four Items</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education solicited answers from elementary school children before the global broadcast. In addition to sending four representative works of categories A, B, C, and D to the Welsh Branch, it has now selected the better type A answer and issued it to the education halls and bureaus of various provinces and cities.</p>
<p>The original order of the Ministry of Education was approved by a letter sent by the British Embassy, the secretary of the Welsh Branch of the International Allied Association, as the ninth annual broadcast of the 1930 May 18 global broadcast of children of Zangs. A book titled "Neir Rui in This Year's Global Broadcast of Children" was attached to the Ministry of Education. The Ministry translated the book into Chinese and ordered the educational administrative organs of various provinces and cities to solicit answers from elementary school children and submit them to the Ministry within a time limit. It also replied to each on file. The answer has been received a lot, but there are no provinces and cities where military operations are carried out, and there are also those that have not submitted papers. It is inevitable that the implementation is not strong. The statistical content of the answers submitted in each volume is approximately the following four items:</p>
<p>A. Agree with the good intentions of the original broadcast, but add conditions to the wishes of the League of Nations (such as the organization of the League of Nations should not be dominated by the great powers, but should make all nations equal). B. Agree with the good intentions of the original broadcast, but have doubts about the League of Nations, believing that the League of Nations is dominated by the great powers and cannot truly promote world peace, popular sentiment, and the construction of a better and more beautiful world. C. Both agree with the good intentions of the original broadcast and say that although China is under the invasion of the great powers, it still does not forget the League of Nations and is willing to do its best to help. D. Agree with the good intentions of the original broadcast and are willing to do their best to support the League of Nations. Generally speaking, there is still something to be seen, but ask if there are those who do not know what the League of Nations is or who do not deeply understand the League of Nations. The hall should order elementary school teachers to explain in detail or compile and distribute supplementary teaching materials for reading. In addition to sending four representative works of categories A, B, and D to the British Embassy for forwarding to the Welsh Branch of the International League of Nations Association, a better type A answer and the original broadcast translation are specially selected and attached to the order, and sent to the elementary schools under the jurisdiction to show the children so that they can observe and learn from each other. This order includes a broadcast translation and a type A answer.</p>
<p>Better Answer: One of the answers from Chinese elementary school children to the global radio broadcast from British Welsh children (Type A). Welsh boys and girls, how happy we are to hear your broadcast! This kind of cry is simply "good news." To unite boys and girls from all countries of the world and work hard in each ethnic group to promote world peace, popular sentiment, and create a better and more beautiful world. We sympathize with this very much. Our Chinese nation has always loved peace, and everyone embraces the ambition of a world of great harmony. There is no reason why we should not agree with your wish. However, the current League of Nations is suspected by ordinary small and weak nations. If it can meet the following conditions: (1) Do not take the victorious countries after the war as the main body of the organization, but allow equal participation of famous nations in the world. (2) Do not allow the great powers to manipulate and act as the mouthpiece of the great powers, but seek the universal welfare among all nations. (3) Have the power to make fair judgments on all disputes between the great powers and the small and weak nations. (4) Be able to stop aggression and eliminate all prejudices of powerful nations against small and weak nations. Then we will trust him wholeheartedly and support and help him with all our strength. Welsh children, we fully agree with your good intentions. We are also preparing to help the League of Nations to change the organization as soon as possible and work hard to do practical work in order to gain the faith of the general small and weak nations.</p>
<p>Broadcast Translation: Radio Broadcast Translation of Welsh Children "We, the boys and girls of Wales, England, have come here from valleys or towns to cheer and celebrate with the boys and girls of all countries. Are you, millions of little friends, willing to unite with us today to express gratitude to those who work hard in all nations to build a better and more beautiful world? Are you willing to unite with us in thought, word, and deed, and move forward from now on to build a better and more beautiful world? The League of Nations has opened up this path forward. We should do our best to help the League take on the responsibility of promoting world peace and popular sentiment and move forward."</p>

<h3 id="e93">Summer Biology Research Association Work <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Twenty-four University Professors Attend</p>
<p>Systematic Research on Lancelets</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Xiamen, July 25th) The Summer Biology Research Association, jointly organized by Xiamen University and the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, has gathered biology professors from various universities across the country to collaboratively research and deeply explore biological sciences, drawing attention from the scientific community. The association's purpose and methods were previously reported in the news. It is now known that the professors began their work on July 14th. Their various activities are of concern to those in society who are enthusiastic about science. This reporter has made a special trip to Xiamen University to inquire and record the following details:</p>
<p>Attendees: Upon investigation, biology professors from various universities across the country were invited by the Research Association to participate in the research, including: Chen Dafu from Zhongshan University, Hedeman and Miller from Lingnan University, Li Kelo from Northeast University, Liu Chongyue from Peking Union Medical College, Lin Kesheng, Nicholas, Ma Wenzhao, and Hou Xiangchuan, Bo Aili from Yenching University, Huo Bili and Zhu Hairu from Ginling College, Ms. Li Fusi from Ginling Women's College, Liu Jingguo from Qingdao University, Bai Luo from Jiujiang, Yu Kangrong from Shanghai University, Wu Zhaofa from Soochow University, Xu Renjie and Huang Nong from Jinan University, Ma Xu from Zhejiang University, Kellogg from Foochow University, Yuanlai from Gulangyu Yinghua Academy, and Chen Ziying and Lin Shaowen from Xiamen University, totaling twenty-four individuals.</p>
<p>Public Activities: The Research Association held a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 14th, where President Lin Wenqing delivered a welcoming address. Dr. Chen Ziying reported on the preparation process and the significance of the gathering. At 6:00 PM that afternoon, Xiamen University hosted a banquet to welcome the attendees. On the 19th, President Lin Wenqing gave a lecture titled "The Evolution of a Gentleman." On the 20th, participants collected specimens at South Putuo. On the 22nd, they observed lancelets at the Liuwudian fishing factory. These were the activities that had already taken place. Other planned activities include weekly lectures by professors, regular marine specimen collection, a biology and teacher conference on August 9th, a conference on the China Coastal Biology Museum on August 18th, and various banquets and entertainment activities. The closing ceremony is scheduled for August 24th.</p>
<p>Research Topics: The professors will conduct systematic research on the lancelet, a well-known species in biology and a specialty of Xiamen. (1) Lin Kesheng: The nervous and muscular systems of lancelets. (2) Chen Ziying: The respiratory physiology of lancelets. (3) Zhu Hairu: Parasites of lancelets. (4) Yu Kangrong: The diet of lancelets. (5) Hedeman: The habitat of lancelets. In addition, the research topics of other professors include: (6) Liu Chongyue: Marine protozoa. (7) Bo Aili: The distribution of amphibians. (8) Hou Xiangchuan: Capillary management in fish. (9) Ma Wenzhao: The function and physiology of cellular secretion. (10) Nicholas: The phototaxis of water fleas. (11) Huo Bili: The reactivity of parasites. (12) Ms. Li Fusi: Fish in Liuwudian (lancelet production area). (13) Wu Zhaofa: Marine annelids. (14) Xu Renjie: Research on sea urchins. (15) Huang Nong: The development of cricket sperm. (16) Liu Jingguo: Marine biological research. (17) Bai Luo: Echinoderms. (18) Kellogg: Wild bees. (19) Miller: Research on wood-boring mollusks (shipworm). (20) Li Kelo: Research on bamboo. (21) Chen Dafu: Eel research. (22) Ma Xu: The biology of termites. (23) Lin Shaowen: The anatomy of lizards. (24) Da Lai: Details unknown.</p>
<p>The Xiamen Sea Biology reporter learned from most of the professors that the abundance of marine life in the Xiamen sea and the diversity of species are not only the best in the coastal areas of China but also rival those of coastal areas in Europe, America, and Japan that have marine biology museums. For example, the rocky bottoms of South Putuo and the Qidao Islands are like stone basins and mortars, providing habitats for living creatures and forming natural aquariums, mainly producing echinoderms such as sea urchins and starfish. The coastal mudflats of Gulangyu, Heshan, and Xiamen are rich in marine worm-like animals. The Jimei area, due to the confluence of tides from the left and right ports, produces even richer and more diverse animals. The lancelets of Liuwudian are world-renowned. Therefore, Xiamen is truly a unique and excellent environment for studying biology. As for the marine biology museum, all the professors are enthusiastic about it, and positive results are expected after the meeting.</p>
<p>Overview of Facilities: The reporter finally visited the facilities of the research institute, which is the biology department of Xiamen University. The northwestern rooms on the first floor are specimen display areas, with abundant materials from marine life to mammals, mostly collected over the years by Dr. Bing Zhi and Professor Laide. Most of the fish, birds, and shellfish have been identified, thanks to the painstaking work of Dr. Bing. The whale, porpoise, and sea cow specimens are particularly rare. The abundance of specimens provides for various specialized research. The southeastern side of the biology department consists of experimental laboratories, with two large rooms, three medium rooms, and three small rooms. Water pipes have been installed, and all rooms have access to flowing seawater, allowing marine organisms to be kept indoors for live research. The experimental equipment is complete. The second floor houses the biology library and the biological material supply center. The basement has storage rooms. The biological material supply center aims to provide biological specimens to universities and middle schools. Many schools have already placed orders, which greatly helps in the development of biological science education in China. ○ The Beijing Summer Education Research Association Holds a Meeting.</p>

Before the report, let us observe three minutes of silence to mourn the passing of Ms. Xia Bao'ying, a teacher from Wusong Peiji Primary School." After the silence, he continued, "This summer school lasted only three weeks, but many lectures were given during these three weeks. The school authorities put a lot of thought into hiring lecturers, and the lecturers enthusiastically explained the material. We should thank them for that. In the past, summer sessions included training courses and workshops, but they suffered from common problems, such as the freedom to attend or not attend as one pleased. The summer school aims to avoid these problems. This is the first session, and future sessions will continue to be organized according to the continuing education regulations. A total of 360 people registered for this session. Seventy-five people never attended any classes. Among those who chose the Party Principles course, 66 people were absent for more than one-third of the classes, 20 people did not attend any classes, and 30 people had perfect attendance. For the Design and Teaching Methods course, 179 people were absent for more than one-third of the classes, 52 people did not attend any classes, and 77 people had perfect attendance. For the Work Course, 148 people were absent for more than one-third of the classes, 33 people did not attend any classes, and 60 people had perfect attendance. For Elementary School Organization and Administration, 141 people were absent for more than one-third of the classes, 39 people did not attend any classes, and 60 people had perfect attendance. For Special Children's Psychology, 112 people were absent for more than one-third of the classes, 48 people did not attend any classes, and 35 people had perfect attendance. For Educational Testing and Statistics, 153 people were absent for more than one-third of the classes, 34 people did not attend any classes, and 44 people had perfect attendance. For Health Education, 56 people were absent for more than one-third of the classes, and 22 people did not attend any classes, with 10 people having perfect attendance. As for the required courses, 360 people registered, 75 people did not attend any classes, and 39 people had perfect attendance. These statistics are disappointing. All courses are important, but only a few people had perfect attendance. This shows that elementary school teachers in the city hold a perfunctory attitude towards education. However, these statistics may not be entirely accurate, as there may be special circumstances, such as illness due to the hot weather. The reasons for absence should be investigated to obtain more accurate statistics. Among the students in the required courses, there were 66 current principals, 77 class teachers, 44 teachers, 17 subject teachers, and 1 kindergarten director from municipal schools. There were also 4 principals, 2 class teachers, 2 academic affairs directors, and 16 teachers from private schools, totaling 24 people. This is also noteworthy. The regulations for continuing education for teachers and staff are being revised, but the established principle is that all teachers should have the opportunity to attend summer school for continuing education. Therefore, absence from summer school without reason is not allowed. Continuing education is for one's own benefit and cannot be limited by law. Elementary school teachers should seize every opportunity to improve themselves and acquire new knowledge, skills, and methods to impart to children in the future. They should realize that attending summer school is a good method of continuing education, a right, not an obligation, an opportunity, not a responsibility. Please note this and inform your colleagues." Next,</p>
<p>Teachers and staff gave speeches. Tang Shouqian briefly stated that this summer school is to promote self-cultivation. Teachers have a very important responsibility, and self-cultivation is essential to fulfill their mission. Summer school is an opportunity for self-cultivation and can solve various difficult problems. Secretary Ni then gave a speech with three points for consideration: (1) China did not have new education in the past, and we should strive for it now. (2) We should recognize that we are ordinary people. (3) We should pay attention to students' physical well-being and also take care of our own bodies. Finally, a student representative gave a reply, thanking the lecturers for their enthusiastic guidance and hoping that the spirit of these three weeks will continue to guide them. The ceremony ended with the dispersal of attendees.</p>

<p>The summer training class for primary school teachers jointly organized by Shanghai's Fengxian and Shanghai counties has been running for nearly two weeks. Each county sent more than 60 primary school teachers to attend the lectures. All lecturers were hired by the Shanghai County Education Bureau and were experts in education. The training period was originally intended to be extended, but due to the approaching start of the fall semester at the end of the year, the planning of school affairs was urgently needed, so it was terminated. Yesterday (the 2nd) was the closing ceremony, which was held at Minhang Central Primary School. The education bureaus of Shangfeng County sent representatives to give instructions.</p>

<p>Accountant Pan Xulun, in order to cultivate excellent accounting and bookkeeping staff for various companies and shops and improve the domestic industrial and commercial accounting system, established an affiliated accounting specialized night school in his spare time. Since its founding, five sessions of students have graduated, totaling more than 200 people. Most of them serve society and are competent in their positions. Some have had their positions increased due to increased knowledge, and some have been introduced to jobs by Accountant Pan, which has been highly praised by all sectors. Recently, due to numerous requests from outside the city for correspondence courses, and at the urging of a certain academic institution, a correspondence department has been added to broaden the training. In order to respond to social requests and meet the expectations of all sectors, Accountant Pan immediately added a charter for the correspondence school and will send it upon request.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Shenmei Girls' Middle School moved to its new campus on Maigen Road, it has strived to improve its facilities. The original principal, Li Cheng, resigned due to personal reasons and took on the position of academic affairs director. The school authorities have appointed Mrs. Huang Meixian, the wife of Interior Minister Niu Yongjian, as the new principal. Mrs. Huang studied in Europe and America and has held important positions in the education sector. Her appointment is expected to bring immeasurable development to the school. It is reported that the school's board of directors has submitted a request to the Municipal Education Bureau for approval and will soon begin to handle the school's registration procedures. The new school building is large in scale, and new students are scheduled to be recruited on the 14th of this month.</p>

<p>Two to Study Abroad, Three Domestically</p>
<p>Panyang Correspondent: Zhang Hanqing previously donated 5 million yuan to the Liaoning Province Primary and Secondary School Education Fund.

<p>Free Talk</p>
<p>A Laughing Matter Hai Ke</p>
<p>A: Your gold watch was stolen by a thief, how come you are still wearing it today? Is it a new one?</p>
<p>B: No, it's the original one. Because the thief was very stupid, he broke the spring. It wasn't worth it for him to repair it, so he sent it back.</p>
<p>A: That old gentleman's head of red hair is really funny. From afar, it looks like a ball of fire. B: I say it looks like a red sun. So the other day, he went home late at night, and the roosters on both sides of the neighbors thought it was the rising sun and crowed together. Do you think it's funny or not? A: My father had a joke the other day. It's very funny to tell.</p>
<p>B: Then why don't you tell it to me so I can laugh?</p>
<p>A: You know how nearsighted my father is. The other day, he walked by the field and bumped into a cow. He quickly apologized and said, "Sorry, madam." He looked closely and saw that it was a cow. He was very ashamed and left. Not far away, he bumped into a woman. He thought it was still the cow and scolded, "You animal, is it you again?" He was slapped twice by the woman. Do you think it's funny or not?</p>
<p>A: Recently, cases of suicide have emerged endlessly. What prevention methods do you think can be taken to avoid a decrease in population?</p>
<p>B: I think people who commit suicide should be treated the same as murderers. Beheading or shooting is acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e103">A Short Stay at Mogan Mountain (2) Jing Bo <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The car arrived at Yucun before 8 o'clock. Mogan Mountain was already visible in the distance. After getting off the car, the Highway Bureau sent someone to have the passengers fill out a survey form. Items such as name, occupation, address, and date of arrival and departure must be written. Western tourists must present their passports before being allowed to climb the mountain, which is not as free as in previous years. The number of residents in the mountain, both Chinese and foreign, is no less than several hundred. They live in harmony with each other, and theft has never occurred. The Mogan Mountain Administration Bureau investigates residents very carefully, and the people in the mountain know the foreign tourists very well. It is easy to know who is staying in a hotel and who is renting a house at first glance, so thieves have nowhere to hide. The Highway Bureau's strict investigation also has an impact on the safety of the mountain.</p>
<p>Mountain sedan chairs are also managed by the Highway Bureau. The number of chair carriers depends on the passenger's weight. There are even those who need eight people to carry them. Each person is paid 7 corners, and tickets are purchased in advance at Yucun. The chair carriers bicker beside them, trying to solicit the strongest passengers, just like the situation of the Roman human market, which is very funny. There are two ways to climb the mountain. The old road, Wukang Road, has steep stone steps and is not easy to climb, but the route is shorter. Most chair carriers take this route. However, at the precipice, it is best to abandon the chair and walk to ensure safety. The new road, Mogan Mountain Road, is owned by the Highway Bureau and is relatively flat. Due to the shape of the mountain, it spirals down, with winding paths and ingenious architecture. However, the journey is slightly longer than the old road. Travelers may want to take the new road for stability. Recently, someone suggested that the authorities expand the new road, leveling the steep parts and raising the low parts, so that cars can pass. In my opinion, the new road does have the possibility of being rebuilt into a car road. When it is realized in the future, wouldn't it be more convenient for mountain climbers?</p>
<p>Mogan Mountain was initially within the sphere of influence of Westerners. The Summer Resort Association managed everything, and Chinese were not allowed to join the association. All the ball fields, swimming pools, etc. were closed to Chinese. The Shanghai Bank had a summer office in the mountain. Its manager, Mr. Li Zhenfu, a righteous and promising young man, vigorously fought against the Summer Resort Association, explaining the great righteousness. The Westerners were overwhelmed and invited the Chinese to join the association. All the ball fields and swimming pools were opened to all. This was praised by those who heard about it. However, this was still during the warlord era. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Zhejiang Provincial Government was established and resolutely established the Mogan Mountain Administration Bureau. The director, Mr. Lin Biao, believed that Westerners were protected by China and should pay taxes within Chinese territory. He consulted with Mr. Li Zhenfu. Mr. Li drafted a notice in Western language and posted it on the main street, stating that those who resisted taxes would have their residences sealed. He then sent people to deliver the notice to each household for signing. The Westerners had no way to avoid it, so they complied with the regulations and paid taxes. However, they were unwilling and sent letters to Western newspapers to forcefully criticize the Chinese, but they did not dare to sign their names. Mr. Li also wrote a long article to refute it. Now, the arrogance of the Westerners has subsided greatly. The responsibility of society lies in advising the meritorious. Mr. Li's efforts to fight for sovereignty cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>○ Briand's Signing Creates New Record Planning</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand has signed as many as 236 treaties on behalf of France with various countries, creating a new record in diplomatic history for signing treaties. The most amazing thing is the short amount of time he has been at it. Now he is continuing his duty to make treaties.</p>
<p>It is found that the first treaty signed by Briand was less than ten years ago. The treaty was a distribution of miners' gratuity between France and Belgium. Followed by the Angola Treaty in October 1921 and the Washington Treaty in December of the same year, which were all related to Pacific affairs. Since then, all French international conventions have been signed by Briand, such as the Dawes and Young Plans, but all in the name of France, with Briand as the representative. As for the treaties signed in Briand's personal name, only the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The official name of the treaty is still the Paris Treaty, not in his personal name. Treaties for the happiness of mankind</p>
<p>Including international restrictions on the arms trade and the use of poisonous gas.</p>
<p>His advocacy of peace and the elimination of war is particularly admirable. Since becoming Foreign Minister, Briand has concluded arbitration and friendship treaties with various countries, including Spain, Portugal, Turkey, Finland, Holland, the United States, Denmark, Poland, and Yugoslavia. Only Germany and Russia have not yet had hope of reaching an agreement.</p>
<h3 id="e104">A Short Record of Spending the Summer in Jiang Village by Chen Boying <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>My friend, Mr. Gu Zhizhou, lives in a place called Jiabin, which is twenty li away from Qingpu County town. We have made several appointments, but I have been entangled in worldly affairs and have not been able to fulfill them. This year, I finally got leave during the summer vacation and went to visit him. Although it was a journey of a hundred li, I experienced the rumbling of wheels, the sound of water in the boat cabin, and the feelings of a traveler. His house faces south and faces the river. Several large elm trees in front of the gate, with their branches and leaves spreading out, block the sunlight from reaching the ground. Across the river are thousands of acres of flat fields, a boundless expanse of green, dotted with woods. Two mountains can be seen in the distance, called Ji Mountain and Yun Mountain, which are where the Lu brothers, Shilu Heng and Shilong Yun, studied. The mountains are small and not high. Slightly to the east is She Mountain, where the red walls of a church can be vaguely seen. Compared to Ji Mountain, She Mountain is like a great sorcerer. The house has three courtyards and five rooms. In the back is a courtyard planted with cypress trees and yellow gardenias, among other plants. Outside the wall are many bamboo trees, which make a rustling sound in the wind, arousing thoughts of autumn. The villagers live together in groups. Behind each house, bamboo and trees are planted, concealing the village from outsiders. Mr. Gu told me that in past years, during the wars in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, when soldiers passed through, they saw the dense trees and bamboo forests and thought there were no inhabitants, so they did not bother to come in, thus avoiding disaster. This is thanks to the bamboo. Outside the bamboo are fields with crisscrossing paths, ending only at the river, which embraces the village on three sides. In the morning, I walk the fields. The sun is just rising, and the heat is not scorching, but the dew is heavy, soaking my shoes and socks. After returning, I take a book and read it at the gate. From time to time, a long wind crosses the river, scattering the branches of the trees and fluttering my sleeves. My whole body feels comfortable, and I have the feeling of discarding the throne and facing south as king. At midday, the clouds do not move, and the sunlight is very strong. The cicada's chirping is like boiling water. I then break a melon and eat it. When I am a little tired, I lean on the couch and take a nap. When I wake up, I ask for a chessboard and play a game of chess. Mr. Gu is more skilled than I, but he does not fully exert his skill. When the game ends, the sun is already setting, no longer something to fear but something to be intimate with, like a high official who, once retired, loses all his former power and influence. Then I go out for a leisurely walk in the village. The evening breeze brushes past me from time to time. The sound of cicadas is slightly tired, and the sound of well sweeps begins, and the croaking of frogs can also be heard here and there. The water birds and partridges in the distant trees also call, though they call to tell of a clear sky tomorrow. Behind the distant trees, the evening glow is beautiful like a painting, with five colors intertwined indescribably. When the glow disappears, the moon rises. When the moon rises, it seems to be suppressed, struggling to rise. It first shows its edge, then gradually half of it, and then gradually the whole thing. Its color is like fire, and it is quite large. The higher it rises, the smaller and whiter it becomes. When it no longer shrinks, it is already three or four times smaller than when it first rose. After dinner, I drag a wicker chair and sit under the tree, listening to the old villagers tell ghost stories. Although they are absurd, they are still enjoyable. In this way, I spent a week, drinking wine, with the host and guests not urging each other to drink, stopping when they were satisfied. We also played bamboo war games, no longer remembering who won or lost. Every meal included crabs, which, although not fully grown, were incredibly tender, unlike anything found elsewhere. I was pressed by affairs and regretted how quickly this week passed.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Thoughts on a Trip to the East (20) (2) <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Qian Hua</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, one wave of incidents involving Filipino athletes had not subsided when another arose. On the 31st, a theft occurred at the Japan Youth Hall, where a Filipino boxer stole money from the dormitory of a Japanese athlete. The Filipino athletes were on the third floor of the Youth Hall, while the Japanese were on the fourth. On the morning of the 31st, a Japanese athlete suddenly discovered that several dozen yen were missing from his clothes hanging on the wall. Because everyone was in the washroom at the time and the door was not locked, they suspected a servant and reported it to the police. Two criminal police officers went to investigate and determined that a certain Filipino boxer was highly suspected. He was brought to the police station for questioning and confessed. However, due to international relations, he was immediately released, and only the stolen money was recovered. The Filipino athletes can be said to be quite troublesome. Among the Filipino athletes, the high jump prodigy Tolentino is the most popular among Japanese female students, and he has many girlfriends. His fame is almost universally known because Tolentino achieved an astonishing high jump record of two meters in this competition, only three centimeters short of the world record. He also defeated Japanese athlete Kimura Kazuo, who scored 1.96 meters. In the 7th competition, the high jump record was 1.835 meters, held by Raysa of the Philippines. In the 8th competition, Tolentino broke the record with 1.93 meters. At that time, Kimura Kazuo won the silver medal with 1.90 meters. After returning to his country, he practiced diligently, and last year Kimura achieved a Japanese record of 1.94 meters. At the same time, Tolentino also had a record of 1.94 meters in the Philippines. Both sides had equal strength, and the Japanese were eager to avenge their defeat. Relying on Kimura's courage, they believed they had a better chance of winning. However, during the competition, Tolentino put on an extraordinary performance, and Kimura was defeated. In this competition, the Filipinos only had this one achievement that was barely satisfactory, and Tolentino's reputation soared. On May 27, at a grand reception in Hibiya Park, the Japanese publicly elected Tolentino to represent the Filipino athletes in a speech. Amidst enthusiastic applause, Tolentino said, "In 1927, in Shanghai, China, I received all kinds of preferential treatment from the Chinese, and my performance improved rapidly, reaching a record of 1.93 meters. After returning to my country, the people treated me even better, and my life was comfortable, so my performance improved to 1.94 meters. In this competition, the Japanese hospitality was impeccable, and the food and lodging were excellent, so my performance suddenly jumped to two meters. This is the proof of the facts." The crowd applauded and laughed. Tolentino's words were indeed subtle and double-edged. As for talk of "honey traps," it is really a case of paranoia and an unfair accusation against the Japanese. In track and field, the all-around competition, swimming, baseball, tennis, etc., the Japanese already have a full grasp of the situation and do not need to resort to tricks. In short, the cause of the scandalous affair is based on the Japanese women's psychology of worshiping athletes. There is one benefit and one disadvantage. The excessive promotion of sports by the Japanese government and public has led to the emergence of this kind of phenomenon.</p>
<p>After the distant trees, the evening glow is as beautiful as a picture, with five colors intertwined indescribably. When the glow disappears, the moon rises. The rising of the moon seems to be suppressed, struggling to rise. It first shows its edge, then gradually half of it, and then gradually the whole thing. Its color is like fire, and it is quite large. The higher it rises, the smaller and whiter it becomes. When it no longer shrinks, it is already three or four times smaller than when it first rose. After dinner, I drag a wicker chair and sit under the tree, listening to the old villagers tell ghost stories. Although they are absurd, they are still enjoyable. In this way, I spent a week, drinking wine, with the host and guests not urging each other to drink, stopping when they were satisfied. We also played bamboo war games, no longer remembering who won or lost. Every meal included crabs, which, although not fully grown, were incredibly tender, unlike anything found elsewhere. I was pressed by affairs and regretted how quickly this week passed.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Elegant Talk of Melons by Yan Qian <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yan Qian</p>
<p>I once met an old melon farmer who gave me a detailed account of his experience growing melons. I will now record some of the more interesting aspects of his talk to help with summer conversation.</p>
<p>For muskmelons, those fertilized with bean cake are the sweetest, especially those near the main stem. The melons near the main stem are called "first vine melons" and have a particularly sweet taste, but they are not round and symmetrical. The melons further down the vine gradually become rounder and larger, but their taste is definitely inferior to the first vine melons. Good melon sellers often offer the first vine melons to people to try, and people think that because they are small, crooked, and have a particularly good taste, the larger, rounder melons must taste even better, so they choose to buy those. Little do they know that the result is the opposite. Therefore, there is a common saying to describe someone who is short and capable but not particularly attractive in appearance: "first vine melon."</p>
<p>Watermelons, on the other hand, are the opposite of muskmelons. The longer the vine, the sweeter the melons it produces. When watermelons are ripe, they must be turned over so that they are exposed to the sun, so that the entire melon gets even sunlight and the sweetness is also even. The water in the melon field must also be evenly distributed. If it is evenly distributed, the melons will be large and beautiful. Whenever there is damage from rain or wind and wilting vines are found, they should be removed. Otherwise, the wilting disease will spread and hinder the growth of the melons. Small spots and scars on the melons are traces of small flying insects such as gnats sucking and eating. Not only do they not harm the melon, but they are a characteristic of the melon's beauty. Whether it is watermelon or muskmelon, one should pay attention to seeking the beauty of its quality during its production and should not only seek the quantity. Therefore, one should often inspect the rows and remove the redundant melons from time to time, so that the remaining melons will be large and beautiful.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who planted the ring unintentionally? This is the fate. Who sings the golden thread with intention?</p>
<p>The pair of bracelets that Zuo Shichen now possesses are foreign-made, but they are things from a bygone era. They are expandable, spring-loaded bracelets with a small watch embedded in the center. They are made of a metal alloy, and when they were new, they must have been as brilliantly golden as gold itself. It's a pity that the gold plating has been worn away by time, and the exterior has lost its color. This is like a person whose golden age has passed, and who has become an obsolete relic. Judging by these bracelets, it was certainly intended to be a state-of-the-art fashion accessory and certainly not designed to facilitate hand labor. It is a women's fashion item. Later, someone came up with the idea of wearing watches on the wrist, which is very convenient. The bracelet can be said to be a relic of a bygone era. In addition, the silver powder box and gold buttons are ordinary objects and nothing to marvel at. The prize redemption center examined the tickets and handed over the prizes one by one, then closed down. At that time, Zuo Shichen wanted to ask what the first prize was. Shi Guanping said that the first prize had already been claimed: it was a pearl brooch in the shape of a flower basket, said to be worth three thousand dollars. Actually, it was not worth three thousand dollars; it was worth only about sixteen or seventeen hundred dollars. It was said to have been won by a young lady from a mansion, which was fitting; it was like giving a fine sword to a hero. You've won so many things, but none of them are useful to you, so you might as well give them to your wife. Zuo Shichen asked, "I heard that you also donated a lot of paintings and antiques. Why aren't any of them in this lottery?" Shi Guanping replied, "We are a separate group. They are a separate group. We can't mix them together. Their group is all jewelry and valuables; in short, things for women. Originally, we wanted to combine the jewelry and valuables with the paintings and antiques, and then distribute them, for example, with the first two prizes being half jewelry and valuables and half paintings and antiques. But some people disagreed, saying that people who like jewelry and valuables may not like paintings and antiques, and those who like paintings and antiques may not like jewelry and valuables. It would be better to separate them so that people can buy tickets for the prizes they prefer. Coincidentally, the ladies donated so much jewelry that it was enough to hold a lottery, so we decided to hold the 'Planting Fortune' lottery first, which was all for jewelry and valuables. That's why the first prize was a pearl brooch and the second prize was a diamond ring, both things that women need. As for the many paintings and antiques that we collected, we also plan to hold a lottery, with all prizes being paintings and antiques. We don't need to squeeze it in the middle of this meeting; we can hold that lottery whenever we want."</p>

<p>Single coppers rise to 6 mace 4.2 fen, a new high for this year's price</p>
<p>Market overview: The market is generally weak due to the slow trade in various industries and the rare demand for silver. Although foreign silver transactions always have a difference of over one million, this lack of market activity is ultimately unofficial. In addition, the stagnation of sales channels is particularly depressing. Furthermore, yesterday was Saturday, and banks closed in the afternoon, resulting in a lack of market confidence.</p>
<p>Money Market Prices (Foreign Interest): The early market for foreign interest was 7 mace, 2 fen, 8.5 li, slightly less than the previous afternoon by 0.25 hao. In the afternoon market, the sentiment was even more depressed, and trading decreased even more, resulting in a lack of competition for money, so the result was the same as the morning market. (Silver Interest): The trend was flooding. The early market for silver interest opened at 0.02 fen. The afternoon market borrowed heads and added water, with no market and rare transactions.</p>
<p>Coin Market Conditions: Jiangnan small foreign coins opened at 6 mace, 3 fen, 9 li in the morning market, an increase of another half a li compared to the previous afternoon's high price. The afternoon market jumped 2 li, to 6 mace, 4 fen, 2 li, the highest price this year. Early market transactions were 4,000 jiao, and afternoon market transactions were 7,000 jiao. Guangdong small foreign coins were 6 mace, 1 fen, 2 li, 7.5 hao in the morning market and 6 mace, 1 fen, 2 li in the afternoon market. Transactions were 135,000 jiao in the morning market and 85,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins decreased by 1,000 cash to 292,000 cash.</p>
<p>Silver and Coin Transactions (Silver): Yesterday, the amount of silver cleared by banks was relatively low due to the weekend. Chinese banks cleared over 1.7 million in notes, foreign banks cleared over 1.2 million in notes, various goods, foreign exchange taxes, and other collections cleared over 5 million, 800,000 were delivered from the warehouse, Japanese banks cleared 2.3 million of various payments, 200,000 went into the warehouse, and money changers cleared over 3.1 million, cleared over 320,000 of heads, transferred over 700,000 from all roads, and took in tens of thousands in cash. (Foreign Silver): Foreign exchange notes cleared 1.25 million in the morning market and 820,000 in the afternoon market. Paper money was 10,000 in the morning market, and there was no market in the afternoon. 5,000 Zhongshan new coins were traded. Only 75,000 yuan in spot paper money were traded in the morning market, and there was no transaction in the afternoon market. Banks traded 450,000 in the morning market and 350,000 in the afternoon market. Transactions with foreign accounts at each bank cleared over 1.2 million, paper money cleared over 100,000, foreign currency changers cleared 3.7 million, foreign currency cleared 110,000, foreign money borrowed cleared over 80,000, and small currency changers traded over 30,000.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market situation for various bond markets was stable and trading was slow. Although many types of spot goods opened, transactions were rare. The sentiment was weak in the morning, and selling continued, resulting in continuous declines of 0.6-0.7 jiao in various bonds such as customs duties, disbandment of troops, etc. Later, buying became slightly more active and trading became stronger. As a result, customs duties, disbandment of troops, futures and other bonds rebounded by 0.4-0.5 jiao compared to the previous day. Other bonds fluctuated up and down. The total daily spot trading volume was only 9,000 yuan, and the futures trading volume was 5.955 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Cotton Yarn Market Shows Significant Expansion <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Guangdong and Shantou syndicates take in 3,210 bales</p>
<p>Cotton yarn market rises in the morning and falls in the afternoon, but the trend is generally strong because of active spot sales</p>
<p>The Guangdong and Shantou syndicates are actively searching for goods on the market. According to some sources, they have purchased most of the goods and are transferring them to warehouses for speculation. Therefore, the trading of 10-count coarse yarn is quite active. However, since it is currently autumn, buyers are still entering the market when prices fall. At present, the demand for spot yarn is strong, and the price of 3-count yarn has risen slightly. Therefore, many people are bullish. However, the current situation is still chaotic, and the sellers of spot yarn still have the intention to sell.</p>
<p>Futures Prices High in the Morning and Low in the Evening, Trend is Still Favorable. Futures prices opened higher in the morning market because of good spot sales by customer syndicates. The Guangdong and Shantou syndicates are actively purchasing on the market, and the market sentiment is particularly tight. The buying sentiment in the yard is strong, and the prices for all months have risen by 0.06, 0.07, and 0.09 yuan. In the afternoon, because raw cotton prices have fallen, the long positions are closing, and the market prices have fallen sharply by 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, 0.05, 0.06, and 0.07 yuan. The total daily transaction volume is 15,950 bales. Yong Feng purchased the most, 1,150 bales. In addition, Da Fu, Shen Xin, Da Ji, Yi Long, Da Feng, Han Feng, De Ji, Da Chang, Cheng Yi, and Yu all purchased between 250 and 1,200 bales. Gong Tai sold 1,200 bales, and Ji Feng, Yu Da, Sen Kang, Shen Yu, He Shen, Shen Chang, and Xin Cheng sold between 350 and 800 bales. The closing prices for futures are recorded below, with the price increases and decreases.</p>
<p>(List of prices is provided with numerical values)</p>
<p>Spot Sales: Spot futures traded for 4,076 bales. Spot yarn sales remain strong. The total daily purchase volume of spot futures is 4,076 bales. Transactions between fellow firms were 1,550 bales. The price increased by 0.05 to 0.075 yuan. The most purchased by customer syndicates was the Guangdong syndicate, which purchased 1,960 bales. In addition, Shantou purchased 1,150 bales, Changsha purchased 195 bales, inland purchased 175 bales, Yunnan purchased 236 bales, Xiamen purchased 150 bales, and miscellaneous syndicates purchased 110 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Cotton Market Favorable, Evening Market Slightly Softer <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Cotton market initially rises and then falls, but buying pressure remains strong due to rebounding US cotton prices and firming sentiment. Long positions took the opportunity to rise. However, Da Feng sold 11,000 piculs alone. The spot cotton market is sluggish. Japanese factories used to buy new cotton vigorously at this time of year, but now few people are asking about it. In fact, Xinjiang cotton is highly absorbent and can likely supply until the end of the year, so there is no need to purchase local cotton. In the afternoon, the market sentiment softened because US cotton inventories were 6,344,400 bales, an increase of 1,144,400 bales compared to last year.</p>
<p>Henan Cotton: Da Feng took the opportunity to sell 11,000 piculs alone. Henan cotton opened higher in the morning, following the rise in foreign cotton. The buying sentiment was strong, and the prices increased by 0.02 and 0.03 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the high inventory of US cotton and news of rain in the Hankou cotton region, the Henan syndicates sold, and the prices fell by 0.025 yuan. Da Feng sold the most, 11,000 piculs. In addition, Yu Ren, Xin Hua Yuan, Da Rong, Xing Yi, Chang sold between 1,000 and 1,900 piculs. Gong Tai, Tong Yu, Guang Feng, Yong Feng, Yi Yu, Li Chang, Xin Cheng, De Ji, Jin Feng, and Tai Chang purchased between 1,000 and 2,500 piculs. The total daily transaction volume was 29,600 piculs. The closing prices for Henan cotton are recorded below, with the price increases and decreases.</p>
<p>(List of prices with numerical values.)</p>
<p>Raw Cotton: The sales channels for raw cotton are almost entirely seized by Indian cotton. The spot cotton business is extremely sluggish. Indian cotton inventories are sufficient, and local cotton has been completely displaced. The source is 560 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 56.00, Rihua Factory took in 20 pieces and sent them to the factory. Yao Cotton 33.60, Wei Tong Factory took in 200 bales and delivered them to the warehouse.</p>

<p>This year, the cotton output in Changshu and Taicang is slightly less than last year. This is due to the high price of rice and rain during the planting season. The cotton seedlings are growing very well, and there is hope for a good harvest. The recent typhoon did not cause damage. The future depends entirely on the weather in the coming days.</p>

<p>Cotton prices in the US rose due to a bullish market outlook. Yesterday, US cotton initially strengthened due to drought reports, and later, the market outlook improved further due to unfavorable forecasts for the West and short covering. Futures rose by 25 to 29 points, and spot prices rose by 25 points. British cotton futures rose by 7 points, while spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton prices were firm, with Pingguoer rising by 1 rupee, Aomula rising by 2 rupees, Bairuoxi rising by 1 rupee, and forward contracts rising by 2 rupees. (One-day telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e117">US Cotton Does Not Seek a Bumper Harvest <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The current situation remains unfavorable.</p>
<p>August weather is important.</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the first of the month reported on the cotton market conditions for the past week, stating that cotton prices this week have fallen to a new low for the season under the pressure of continued liquidation by Wall Street and selling from the South, as well as reports of continued sluggishness in the textile industry. Although there have been unfavorable reports on the climate and cotton production, they have failed to arouse the interest of traders and speculators, and the general sentiment is increasingly bearish. Rain has been seen recently in the central part of the cotton belt, but it has only reduced some of the drought. Texas and Oklahoma have only had a few light showers, and the high temperatures have not abated. Reports of deteriorating cotton production have increased significantly. Private year-end reports indicate that the average condition of new cotton crops is currently 66.7% of normal, which may result in a harvest of approximately 14,182,000 bales. It is said that buying interest rose slightly when prices fell, because cotton prices were lower than the average cost of production, and it is believed that if the weather in August remains dry and hot, the overall situation may change rapidly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that rain has been seen in various parts of the Southwest, but the rainfall is insufficient. If the drought and heat are not reduced immediately, the damage in the Southwest will be significant. General trade is poor, especially in textiles. There will inevitably be more supply for hedging sales in the future, so the market sentiment is bearish. Speakers still say that only a normal cotton production is needed at present. Attached are the weekend statistics as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1929 1930 This Season:</p>
<p>Cumulative Marketed: 238 Cumulative Factory Use since August 1: 343</p>

<p>A telegram from New York on the first of the month, according to Mr. Hester, Secretary of the New Orleans Cotton Exchange, stated that US cotton stocks at the end of July 1920 were 6,344,000 bales, an increase of 1,665,000 over last year.</p>
<p>Scarce Rice and Rice Flour in the Lower River Area Rise in Unison</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 10 ships arrived in Zhabei. The total stock in the lower river area is about 90 ships. Among them, the high-quality goods are extremely scarce, and the middle-grade and second-grade goods are more common. The market sales in this street are exceptionally active. Therefore, the newly arrived goods have generally risen by about 30 cents. The situation is very good. The ordinary goods have generally risen by about 20 cents. The old second-grade glutinous rice has also been traded. The trading of each type of glutinous rice was fairly good throughout the day. The trend is gradually rising. Very few new glutinous rice shipments arrived in Dongxin, so most rice mills use it for their own consumption. The sales are very small. The market price has nominally risen by 23 cents compared with the previous day, but it is heard that the high-quality goods have returned to 20 yuan. In short, the scarcity of goods has led to hoarding. The fragrant rice in the lower river area only has middle-grade and second-grade goods. The high-quality goods are very scarce. Therefore, although there is news of rising prices for foreign rice, there is very little demand for this type of goods. Therefore, the overall market price has always been between 16.5 yuan and 17 yuan. The thin rice has increased, and the top-quality goods must be 21 yuan. Market transactions are not smooth due to the thin goods. The changed yuan arrives with small sales and high prices. The corner and a half opened high at 18.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of goods in the South Shanghai river area is very scarce. The sales fields in each block are very active. The white broken rice in Changshu and other places is not seen to be received, so the stock has dried up. Therefore, the market price is shouted high. The top price in the market is between 20 yuan and 78 cents. The situation is firm. The situation of the white glutinous rice in Suzhou and Tong is stable. Because the sales in the village streets are not smooth, it is mostly not easy to obtain. Or those who are qualified and coincidental are slightly advanced. The price only rises slightly by a fraction of an inch. The arrival of thin rice in Nanbang is light, and the production price and the Shanghai price are still barely compatible. Therefore, the wood shop's sales are active, and the price is gradually rising. However, the high and low grades of this product vary greatly, and the market situation is similar to that of the northern market. The high-quality goods are 20 yuan and 56 cents, while the second-grade goods are only 17.5 yuan. The price of new glutinous rice follows the gate market and is also the same. The overall market situation is firm, and the sales field is still good. The overall market price is similar to that of the previous day.</p>

<p>Dalian and other ports have been fully opened for transportation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the initial price of foreign rice was flat. The outlets are still only inland and retail customers. Then, because the Jianghai Customs announced that the northern opening was opened, people's hearts were encouraged. Dalian and Tianjin started buying and testing the installation. The market situation suddenly became active. The top-quality rice rose by 20 cents or more. The prices of other types of rice all rose by half a corner or more. However, the prudent northerners did not buy, so the transaction was not very high. Moreover, in the afternoon, according to the customs declaration firm, Dalian and other ports can indeed be reported to be installed. Tianjin has not yet implemented the exemption, and those who have already reported are returned to the customs. Therefore, the shape slightly flattened in the afternoon. The overall market opened with No. 1 Saigon, 3,000 bags, high-quality goods opening at 17 yuan, ordinary goods at 16.5 yuan; No. 2, 2,000 bags, price at 13.85 yuan; small squeezed rice, 500 bags, price at 14.5 yuan; large squeezed rice, 1,000 bags, high at 13.15 yuan, ordinary at 12.6 yuan; Min Dang, 200 bags, price at 14.95 yuan; small squeezed brown rice, 300 bags, price at 11.55 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Starch Market Rises Sharply by Three Cents <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning and already showed a high price trend. Because the external short sellers, in view of the fact that the manufacturers do not particularly look down on them, are all engaged in covering, causing each month to be about one cent good. When the market opened in the afternoon, each month suddenly showed tension, because it was rumored that the spot goods in Tianjin Port can now be loaded and shipped. Although it has not yet become a reality, the manufacturers do have this hope and are already in contact with the authorities. Therefore, the thinking of the customer gang has also become active. The outside short-sellers are deeply afraid that if it becomes a reality in the future, then the squeeze in this month is in the expectation. Therefore, the opening price is invisibly increased by two cents compared to the morning. The forward price is also similar. However, later, because the customs still has no announcement to revoke the ban on transportation, people's hearts are slightly settled. However, after this rumor spread, the market situation has stabilized again. As a result, this month is up 2 cents and 7.5 cents compared to the previous day, September is up 3 cents and 2.5 cents, October is up 2 cents and 7.5 cents, November is up 3 cents, December is up 2 cents and 7.5 cents, and January is up 3 cents and 7.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Wheat Market is Chaotic and Jumps Violently, Slightly Receding <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market in the morning and afternoon showed an unusual chaos. Because the flour is rumored to be exportable, then the demand for wheat will naturally follow the flour. Therefore, the number of buyers inside and outside the industry is extremely prosperous. Due to the excitement of people's hearts, this month once rose to four taels and nine qian at the second trading plate in the afternoon, an increase of one qian and four fen compared to the closing price of the previous day. The remaining months also saw horizontal jumps. However, later, because the flour cannot be reliably exported, the general floating price returned to a large number, a drop of six, seven or eight fen from the top price of the second trading plate. However, since the manufacturers are unwilling to see the price of flour fall, the foothold of the wheat market is of course firm and undoubtedly. As a result, this month is 7 cents better than the previous day, September is up 9 cents, October is up 8 cents, November is up 7 cents, December is up 6 cents, and January is up 1 qian. Although transactions in the spot wheat market are not very smooth, since the standard has seen a sharp rise, the customer's thinking is not as weak as before. Therefore, the middle-grade and second-grade goods seem to be secretly tightened. The market price of each block yesterday was similar to the previous one. A total of more than 9,000 bags of wheat from Taierzhuang, Haizhou, Yaowan, Mingguang, Zhenjiang, Gaoyou, Dongtai, and Hankou were opened, and a total of two families, Fufu, handled it.</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign merchants in the tea market in this port and merchants in the Luzhuang district made every effort to search for needle eyebrow green tea, and transactions were smooth. However, since yesterday, Chinese tea merchants, in view of the fact that the market's inventory is thin and the source is limited, the opening price seems to be slightly higher than before. There is still no major progress in the Zhenmei market. The price of low-quality tea in the middle and low-grade districts seems to have no hope of rising. In addition, although both English and Russian merchants have sporadic appetite for Keemun black tea, most of the tea currently unsold in the market is second- and third-grade goods with poor body. At this time, when Indian and Javanese tea are competing for sales at low prices, sales are quite difficult to turn around.</p>

<p>The pig lead market has been in a state of silence for a long time, so there have been no transactions in the market for a long time.

The price is estimated at 15 taels and 67 qian per dan. It is heard that the retail opening price is 16 taels. The export business has been limited recently.

<p>Yesterday, according to sources at the Japanese Legation Office, the Japanese government's Ministry of the Navy, citing the Chinese Xiang Rebellion, dispatched a number of warships to China to protect Japanese nationals. After receiving the order, the fleet had already prepared all the procedures for departure, awaiting orders to move out. However, Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi was well aware of the local political situation in China and was quite calm in his attitude, so he was not alarmed. Although there was a slight disturbance in Hunan Province, other places were extremely safe, and the National Government had dispatched a large number of troops to suppress the rebellion, which could be quelled within days. There was no need to dispatch troops and warships in such a commotion, which would provide an excuse for diplomatic relations. Therefore, in addition to going to Beijing to exchange opinions, he had telegraphed back to the Japanese government to inform them of the actual situation, so that the Japanese government could understand the truth and stop the Japanese navy from acting rashly.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Progress of Various Circles in Preparing for the Construction of Sun Yat-sen's Bronze Statue <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the proposal by various circles in Shanghai to build a bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen at the North Railway Station was initiated in 1928. At that time, the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration and the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Municipal Government, and the Songhu Garrison Command jointly suggested that various agencies and organizations in Shanghai join and organize the Shanghai North Railway Station Construction Sun Yat-sen Bronze Statue Committee. It was decided that the construction cost would be 30,000 yuan, and a donation booklet would be printed and distributed to various agencies to raise funds. The base of the bronze statue had already been laid in the open space in front of the Shanghai North Railway Station Bureau. Over the years, it has been affected by the current situation and personnel changes, and the person in charge has lacked the ability to carry it out, which has led to delays. Since this year, the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, the Songhu Garrison Command, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration have repeatedly convened representatives of various agencies to meet and discuss ways to continue the work and expedite its implementation in the shortest possible time. Therefore, the Shanghai All Circles Construction Sun Yat-sen Bronze Statue Preparatory Committee was reorganized and held meetings to actively prepare. Another donation booklet was printed and distributed to various agencies to be responsible for soliciting donations. The funds raised were sent directly by the fundraising agencies to the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank for storage and receipts were issued. Later, the donations collected amounted to more than 20,000 yuan, so the conference discussed and decided to proceed with the construction. However, since the various agencies were scattered in various places for business, it was extremely inconvenient, so the meeting decided to elect more than a dozen construction committee members and then elect five standing committee members from the construction committee to be responsible for the work, namely, Ye Xiufu, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, Zhang Taiji, representative of the Songhu Garrison Command, Lin Yan, representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government, Wang Jinzhi and Wang Chunbai, representatives of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, Zheng Fusang, and Wang Xiaolai, a well-known businessman. Since the establishment of the construction committee, the standing committee members have decided on every step of the construction by first soliciting drawings of Sun Yat-sen's bronze statue and engineering plans, and then having the committee review whether they are appropriate to decide whether to adopt them and modify them, and then decide on the subsequent course of action. It is because Sun Yat-sen's achievements in the party and the country were outstanding throughout the ages, and the training of respecting achievements and repaying virtue was taken as an example for making gold and casting statues. It is not only the view of the capital city, but also the glory of thousands of years. The drawings and engineering plans for this statue must be carefully selected for adoption in order to show respect. Therefore, on June 5 this year, a special announcement was published in the Shenbao, News News, Shishi News, and the Republic of China Daily to solicit applications widely. It is heard that there are quite a few applicants. The statutory period for accepting the drawings is limited to one week, ending on June 11, and no invitation for bids was published. It is now heard that the committee members attach great importance to this matter. All proposals are not only made with great care, but also all matters are decided by public vote. The reviewers have signed the responsible review report, and the report's opinions must still be thoroughly discussed and decided by the entire committee to determine adoption. It is heard that the committee members said that the organization of this public group is entirely composed of all circles in Shanghai, and it is a matter of commemorating Sun Yat-sen's merits and establishing a bronze statue. All the funds are donated by the public. If it is not to insult Sun Yat-sen and violate the dignity of the party, and other non-Jiang actions, and there is solid evidence, one or two committee members in the meeting cannot control it, let alone be manipulated by external slander, and no one can destroy it.</p>

<p>Recent surveys show over 400 million yuan.</p>
<p>Losses due to silver devaluation will diminish in the future.</p>
<p>The Statistics Department of the Legislative Yuan, in order to address the issue of gold appreciation and silver devaluation, has recently sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate the state of international finance over the past sixty years. According to a survey, the exact amount of remittances from overseas Chinese to China each year is over 400 million yuan. It is divided into two parts: one is savings and interest in Chinese banks, and the other is investment in domestic industry and commerce to revitalize national products. Overseas Chinese remittances home are all remitted in gold pounds from their countries of residence. When they arrive in Shanghai, they are converted into silver yuan according to the market price. Since the issue of gold appreciation and silver devaluation has occurred, the savings of general overseas Chinese have suffered greatly. If our country does not quickly implement a gold exchange standard to remedy the situation, there are fears that future remittances from overseas Chinese will diminish.</p>

<p>Japanese Ships Transport Rice, Japanese Factories Grind Wheat</p>
<p>Since the Jianghai Customs prohibited the transportation of food to various ports in North China by Japanese ships, the Shanghai side has not allowed the shipment of white rice, flour, and other items to Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin. A large number of foreign rice was blocked in Shanghai in late last month, as reported in this newspaper. However, there is a great shortage of food in the north, and the people's livelihood has also caused panic. The Jianghai Customs generally refuses to close customs for those who report the shipment of food. Recently, it has been confirmed that a certain Japanese shipping company in this port has sent ships to carry a large amount of foreign rice directly to Tianjin, and the first batch of 2,000 bags was loaded and shipped the day before yesterday. A second batch of foreign rice will be transported in the near future. Japanese merchants are acting as agents for wheat flour. The sales of Beiyang wheat flour are very large. Since the Ministry of Finance of the National Government ordered the prohibition of flour exports, southern wheat flour has no way to ship out. It is heard that the north is contracting with Japanese wheat flour manufacturers to use various factories to transport wheat to Japan for grinding into flour and then transport it to Tianjin, and also to purchase 200,000 dan of foreign flour from Japan to meet urgent needs. Recently, there has been a lot of foreign flour loaded onto ships in Shanghai for Tianjin. Various shipping companies are competing to solicit shipments. The freight rate, which used to be 18 cents per dan, has now been reduced by Taikoo by 9 cents first, a decrease of half the original price. On average, each bag of flour only costs 3 cents for the water foot (transportation fee), because three bags make up one dan. Chinese and Japanese merchant ships have also followed suit and lowered prices.</p>

<p>Workers Resume Work Today</p>
<p>Officials Send Police to Protect</p>
<p>The labor strike at the Yingchang Factory of the Greater China Match Company in Lujia Ferry, Pudong, was caused by the dismissal of one worker. The various agencies have sent people to mediate many times without a decision. Yesterday morning at 9:00, the Social Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Department, invited representatives from both labor and capital to the bureau to discuss the matter again. Seven labor representatives, including Cao Shenyun, He Guitang, and Wu Xingxiang, and two capital representatives, Mr. Qian and Mr. Qi, attended the meeting. At the same time, two staff representatives, Zhang Zili and Zhang Meichun, were also elected to attend. The labor side first put forward conditions, requesting that eight workers, including Zhu Jinshu, Xue Jinshu, Wang Jinpei, Zhou Longer, Lu Koulong, Zhao Yukui, Liu Chunlin, and Zhu Hongbiao, who had been detained by the Public Security Bureau, be released first, and that Tong Zhaosan, who had been laid off, be restored to work. The Greater China Company should give a corresponding retirement salary for the dismissal during the strike period. After repeated discussions by the mediators, the conditions are that the workers of the factory did not obtain the consent of the authorities before the strike, which is an illegal act. Considering the ignorance of the workers, they should first resume work as a prerequisite, and then discuss the conditions related to labor-capital relations. As for the eight workers who were arrested, they are suspected of other cases and are not involved in the scope of labor-capital relations. They must be judged by law before deciding whether to release them. The labor side agreed and signed the agreement on the spot, and notified the workers to resume work at 3:00 in the morning (today). At that time, the staff representatives also made a request, stating that on the day the labor strike was launched, they were hungry in the factory for a day until the Public Security Bureau rescued them in the evening. Hu asked the Public Security Bureau to send police to protect the security when they entered the factory after resuming work. The Public Security Bureau representatives who attended the meeting agreed to first gather all the staff in the Pudong Third District Office at 8:00 am today and then酌派長警 protect them to enter the factory and serve.</p>

<p>General Assembly: The French Water and Electricity Workers' Union held a general meeting of all members at the Daji Road Public Sports Field at 3:00 pm yesterday. More than 1,400 people attended. The Municipal Party Department specially sent representatives Zhang Yunqing, Hu Shouqi, and Zhao Zhenhui, representatives of the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union Support Association, to attend and guide the meeting. Zhang Amao was publicly elected as the chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting and the tough attitude of the capital side, which could not be approached for mediation. Since the start of the labor strike, nearly 40 people have been forced by the factory to go on strike due to the oppression of imperialism. All the workers could no longer bear it and requested that all circles give practical assistance and unite in the spirit of fighting externally. Then, Xu Amei spoke in succession to discuss and decide on important cases as follows: (1) For the July 21 tragedy, the French authorities are requested to formally apologize to this meeting, and the resolution was unanimously passed by all. (2) All staff in the company's comprador office are required to report to the meeting today. (3) How should we deal with the workers in the car department who are scabs and drive trams out of the factory to undermine strike discipline? The resolution was unanimously resolved to deal with all of them. (4) In the future, the news of meetings of the car affairs, mechanical affairs, and staff departments will be merged and published in a unified manner. (5) It is decided that a joint meeting of the strike committee and the picketing team will be convened at the association at 9:00 am tomorrow (the 3rd) to discuss the method of proceeding.</p>
<p>Staff Meeting: The staff meeting was held at 10:00 am. 230 staff members attended the meeting. Zhang Renjun was publicly elected as the chairman. The chairman then reported that the staff support association had sent representatives to contact the matter, saying that he had heard that the company was planning to hire Westerners to replace the positions, which was not true. The representatives had made a clear statement that the company had no such intention. As for the mediation, he heard that the capital side was currently in contact with the consuls, etc. The general result could be satisfactory, and the comprador himself was also trying his best to find a way to eliminate the labor strike as soon as possible, and asked him to make concessions and not insist on the previous agreement. Subsequently, Yan Baoshu, Zhu Yonghua, Fan Baokun, Dai Molin, Feng Shenglin, and others spoke in succession, and their words were very sincere. Finally, the extension of the strike was discussed. It is heard that a proper method has been raised.</p>
<p>Notice from the Support Association: Notice No. 53 from the Shanghai Municipal Trade Union Support French Water and Electricity Workers' Union regarding the announcement of the matter. The labor strike of French water and electricity in this city has been prolonged without a decision. All the details of the matter are known. However, the various committees of this association are organized by the election of various trade unions, but the ability is limited. I am sincerely afraid that it will be difficult to do. Therefore, it is specifically scheduled to convene a general meeting of representatives of all trade unions in the city at 1:00 pm on the 6th of this month on the third floor of the Municipal Party Department to gather the strength of the group to jointly plan for the method of dealing with the matter. In addition to formally requesting the Municipal Party Department to send personnel to attend and guide the meeting, Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, is also invited to attend the meeting to report on the progress of the mediation. At that time, I hope that your association will send representatives to attend the meeting to express their opinions and jointly plan the course of action. This is very important.</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Trade Union, saying that it was an order to comply with the law. The case was based on the Municipal Government's Order No. 5204, which stated that the French Concession authorities' labor strike has been disrupted and there is still no solution. This matter has been repeatedly negotiated between the Yong with the French Concession authorities and the workers in order to settle the matter. The situation is as follows: yesterday, I met with the French Consul General and received a firm entrustment to resolve the matter as soon as possible. Yong is obliged to do so, but he is deeply concerned that it will be difficult to recover the situation. All parties must sincerely help each other to avoid undermining the cause. I beg you to advise the workers to remain calm and wait for a solution. Do not act impulsively to avoid causing additional problems and expanding the trend. As for the fact that the Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Committee is also very cautious about this labor strike, whether it should be transferred to the Municipal Party Department for proper handling and to resolve the problems in an invisible manner, and whether you should inform them to work together to adjust and clarify the sub-items to achieve twice the result with half the effort, I hope you will make a wise decision and also show your reply, etc., in addition to replying to continue to work to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, and also inform the Civil Training Committee to cooperate in adjusting, clarify, and order that the Bureau should immediately investigate and transfer the order to the labor side to wait quietly for a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Yarn Factory Industry Workers' Union <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The preparatory committee of the Shanghai Yarn Factory Industry Workers' Union held its first meeting yesterday at the Xihe Yarn Factory Workers' Union. Huang Huanan, Wang Ruiting, Zhou Zhonghua, Zhou Ziyang, and others attended, with Xu Shaochuan as the instructor. The following matters were resolved: (1) Regarding the assignment of duties, it was decided to appoint Zhou Ziyang, Li Changgen, and Ju Xizhang as standing committee members, with Zhou Zhonghua and Wang Ruiting as the director and deputy director of the guidance section, and Huang Huanan and Wu Fuxing as the director and deputy director of the registration section. (2) The proposal to appoint Bao Ziheng, Long Yunfeng, and Cai Keguang as staff members of the union was approved. (3) The proposal to appoint Chen Zhongrou as secretary and Wu Yuchen as recorder was approved. (4) The union decided to commence operations on August 3rd. (5) (Omitted). (6) Publish a declaration. (7) Prepare a budget statement for convenient disbursement, which was decided to be handled by the standing committee members. (8) The use of the official seal should be reported to the higher authorities for record. (9) A request should be submitted to the Public Training Association for a letter to the Public Security Bureau and the political department of the Public Concession, requesting enhanced protection for the union's staff. (10) The union's regular meeting date should be decided, and it was resolved to hold it every Sunday. The meeting adjourned. The declaration of the establishment of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Yarn Factory Industry Workers' Union reads: To all levels of Party departments, organizations, labor unions, and compatriots across the nation, since the late Premier founded the revolution, adopted the Three Principles of the People, and sought the liberation of weak and small ethnic groups and the slogan of overthrowing imperialism, the people, who were under heavy oppression and on the verge of death, all rose up to support the revolution, seeking their own liberation and overthrowing the oppression of imperialism and capitalists. Therefore, before the revolutionary army arrived, the people had already organized groups to welcome the revolution with incense and flowers and assist in eliminating warlords. Among them, our laboring workers were the most powerful because the greater the oppression, the stronger the resistance. It is a natural principle that workers are willing to sacrifice, fearless of hardship, and go through fire and water with a spirit of fearlessness to fulfill their responsibility as revolutionaries. This is also due to the unbearable oppression of capitalism and imperialism during the Manchu autocratic era. In all matters, it is important to have a beginning and an end and to seek thoroughness to achieve good results. Reflecting on the late Premier's revolution, it took ten failures to overthrow the Manchu Qing Dynasty, abolish autocracy, and establish the foundation of the Republic of China. If at that time the determination was not firm and there was a slight discouragement, how could the great cause of the revolution have succeeded? Now, using the Premier's revolution as an analogy to our workers' movement, the workers' movement belongs to the workers' revolution. Whoever is on the workers' side, who does not sympathize and who is not excited? Thus, the substantial strength of the workers' movement is evident. It is regrettable that Chinese workers are discouraged before failing and arrogant before succeeding. This common problem within themselves creates numerous obstacles for the future. Not only will it fail to promote success, but it will also lead to a dead end. The nation's industry is declining day by day, and the suffering of workers is increasing day by day. As the saying goes, "The boatman digs a hole in his own boat," which is truly not false. This is truly heartbreaking for the trajectory of the Chinese workers' movement and unfortunate for the future of the nation. However, as the ancients said, "To err and not correct is to err indeed." Now that we know the past mistakes of the Chinese workers' movement, we should correct them and continue to strive for the realization of liberation. This is not only fortunate for the workers of the whole country but also fortunate for the future of the nation. In the past, the Shanghai workers' movement was controlled by the Communist Party and manipulated by politicians, resulting in fragmentation and chaos. The workers' knowledge is limited, and they are at a loss and easily mistake the enemy for their father and make unnecessary sacrifices to be used as tools by these people. Moreover, there is no way to alleviate their own suffering. The workers' strength is dispersed, and the organization is lax, resulting in self-cannibalization and countless malpractices. If it is like this in a big port, the situation in other areas can be imagined. This time, the Municipal Party Department, based on the trade union law promulgated by the Central Government, has ordered the establishment of industry-wide federations. This industry has been ordered to establish the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Yarn Factory Industry Workers' Union. The union silently remembers the importance of the entrusted task and the eagerness for improvement, so it intends to propose several guidelines: (1) Organize and consolidate the trade unions in the industry. There are no less than dozens of cotton yarn factories in this city, and nearly ten have trade union organizations, while the majority still do not have organizations. The union intends to consolidate those that already have organizations to make them sound, and send personnel to guide the organization of those that have not been organized, so that the industry has a sound organization, and all workers are on the right track, seeking the liberation of workers under the leadership of the Party and helping the development of the disaster relief industry. (2) Eliminate the Communist Party. Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together, and the concessions are adjacent to each other, making it easy for the Communist Party to hide. There are often incidents of inciting workers and agitating for strikes, which not only destroy the workers' movement but also hinder social security. The union will strictly investigate and prevent loyal workers from being deceived. (3) Implement labor-capital cooperation. It is found that the oppression suffered by Chinese workers from domestic capitalists is small, and the greatest oppression is from imperialism. Because China has been subjected to political and economic aggression, the Chinese proletariat has no place to stand. If we do not seek a fundamental solution, it will be useless. In the future, the union should abide by the late Premier's teachings, adopt a near-sighted and far-reaching strategy, first find a way to eliminate the aggression of imperialism, increase Chinese production, improve industry, consolidate the foundation of the nation, and the liberation of workers will have a good way. The above points are only a summary of the major ones. In short, the union aims to unite forces to seek the liberation of workers and strive for the survival of the nation. Under the leadership of the Party, it will work hard for the workers' movement. Anyone who destroys the workers or undermines the workers' movement will be dealt with with all our strength without leniency. It is hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will provide guidance and make up for our shortcomings to complete our mission. This declaration is made.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Strike at the Pudong Rihua Yarn Factory <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Declaration of Assistance from Various Trade Unions in Pudong</p>
<p>The Shanghai British-American Tobacco Factory Union, the Shanghai Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Union, the Shanghai Taikoo Shanbei Steamboat Loading and Unloading Union, the Shanghai Yingchang Match Factory Union, the Shanghai Pudong Construction Union, the Shanghai Pudong Porter Union, the Shanghai Pudong Garment Union, and others issued a declaration yesterday stating that over 3,000 workers from the seven Rihua Textile Unions in Pudong have had a glorious history in the past revolutionary journey. However, in recent years, the union affairs have been controlled by a small number of labor traitors and running dogs who have helped the Japanese imperialist capitalists oppress the workers and completely sold out the union, causing the workers to suffer unspeakable miseries. According to what we know, among the over 3,000 workers in the Rihua Yarn Factory, over 1,000 are temporary workers. Because the wages of temporary workers are the lowest and no rice allowance is given, several wages and rice allowances can be saved each month. There are often cases where people who have been in the factory for one or two years are still working as temporary workers. They recruit as many temporary workers as possible and squeeze out as many permanent workers as possible, making everyone feel insecure and have to obey orders. This is the first point. The Rihua Yarn Factory has over 2,000 workers, which is not a small number. Labor-capital conditions have never been signed. Even if there are occasional local disputes, the resolutions made by the Party and government agencies are completely overturned by the factory and none are implemented. This is the second point. The central government stipulates long-term holidays. All Chinese and foreign factories have strictly followed this rule. The Pudong British-American factory stops work for 11 days each year, and the Xiang Sheng factory stops work for 14 days each year. The factory pays wages and rice allowances as usual. However, the Rihua Yarn Factory does not have this kind of treatment. This is the third point. Gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and prices are soaring. Other Chinese and foreign factories have voluntarily increased wages. The Rihua workers, who have the lowest wages, are naturally unable to make a living. However, the factory not only refuses to increase wages but also fines workers for even the slightest mistake. The fines are always several times higher than the wages. If you open the factory's fine book, it is truly heartbreaking. Each month, the entire factory is fined at least several thousand yuan or more. This kind of fine is the same as the temporary workers, which is a way to deduct wages and exploit workers. I am afraid that there is no such harsh example in all Chinese and foreign factories in the city and the country. This is the fourth point. The Rihua Yarn Factory has to work 11 and a half hours every day, and only half an hour for lunch is the rest time. The factory also increases the workload. The number of teeth in the fine yarn machine is increased from 36 to 54, and the speed of the machine is extremely fast. The factory only knows about production and does not care about the lives of the workers. This is the fifth point. The above are just a few of the known oppressions, and it is difficult to enumerate the other oppressions. Just from this small sample, we can see the ferocious face of the Japanese imperialist capitalists and the ruthless heart of the labor traitors and running dogs who trample on the workers. It can also prove that the demands of all the workers in the Rihua Yarn Factory this time, such as paying wages on commemorative days, increasing rice allowances, shortening the time for leave, not delaying deductions from wages, and stopping night work on Sundays in summer, are not excessive at all. Now that the factory has rejected the workers' minimum demands, after the strike, it is listening to the instigation of the labor traitors and running dogs to expel loyal workers. The party and government mediation has been repeatedly rejected. The trade unions believe that the Rihua Yarn Factory's treatment of the workers is not only unbearable for the Rihua workers but also fears that this trend will be followed by other factories, and the entire interests of the workers will be destroyed. Therefore, on the one hand, we expose the various inhumane atrocities of the Rihua Yarn Factory capitalists in oppressing the workers with facts, and on the other hand, we unite the 800,000 workers in the city to help the striking workers in the Rihua Yarn Factory to get rid of the unequal shackles and allow the more than 3,000 oppressed compatriots to strive for the final victory and restore their human status from a non-human status, so that we can fulfill our responsibility.

<p>Arriving in China on October 6th</p>
<p>The New Shanghai News reports that the Canadian government, in order to promote foreign trade and understand the commercial situation in the Far East, specially organized a Far East Trade Investigation Group to visit China. The consulate in Vancouver has already telegraphed a report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the composition and purpose of the investigation group. According to the news from the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the group has been organized and all members, about 16 or 17 people, are scheduled to depart from Canada on October 6th to travel to various parts of the country for investigation and research. Shanghai and Hong Kong are the two places that the group will pay the most attention to. It is expected that they will stay in China for one month and then return home.

<p>○ International News Telegram: Actively reducing the price of international news telegrams, the Ministry of Communications is consulting with various relevant submarine and wireless companies, but attention must be paid to whether the content of the news telegram is accurate. The Ministry of Communications believes that there are many people from our country residing abroad, but due to the high cost of international news telegrams, the telegram service is not very developed, resulting in many overseas Chinese being isolated from the political, commercial, and social situation of their motherland. The ministry now intends to consult with various relevant submarine and wireless telegraph companies to actively reduce the price of international news telegrams to facilitate the dissemination of information. All the companies have agreed to consider reducing the price, but attention must be paid to whether the content of the news telegram is accurate to avoid confusion.</p>

<p>Foreigners Need Not Panic Unnecessarily</p>
<p>Japanese Acting Minister to China Shigemitsu Aoi received an urgent telegram from the Foreign Ministry of his government the day before yesterday (the 1st), instructing him to travel to Beijing by night train at 11 pm, accompanied by Secretary Hayashi, Secretary Nomura, and Secretary Asahina, to meet with Foreign Minister Wang and Acting Chairman Tan to discuss methods to protect the security of Japanese nationals in the Hunan and Hubei areas and exchange various opinions on handling the aftermath. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai next week. According to his temporary statement, "This time, I am instructed by my government to go to Beijing to meet with Foreign Minister Wang and others to discuss the security protection of Japanese nationals in Hunan and Hubei. There is no other meaning besides exchanging opinions. Although the bandit-communist incident in Hunan Province is extremely serious, I firmly believe that the National Government has the ability to guard against and suppress it and will soon be able to quell it and make the outside world safe from danger. Therefore, in my opinion, foreigners must not panic unnecessarily to avoid disturbing themselves. After I arrive in Beijing, I will stay in Beijing for a few days due to the summer heat and plan to return to Shanghai via Yongdao next week." Judging from Mr. Shigemitsu's attitude, he is very calm. As for the rumors that the Japanese have formally lodged a protest, it is a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>It was agreed to donate from June 1st</p>
<p>Sand fishing boats entering and leaving Wusong from Tongchonghai and other areas should pay boat donations to the Boat Donation Office of the Municipal Finance Bureau in accordance with the regulations. However, boat owners have been claiming that sand fishing boats are different from other types of boats and have not complied with the donation rates set by the Municipal Finance Bureau. All sand fishing boats entering and leaving the port should donate funds, which are temporarily recorded by the Wusong Chamber of Commerce for settlement. Now, the new director of the Finance Bureau, Mr. Tang Naikang, is actively rectifying the donation affairs and pays great attention to this case. He specially sent staff members Zhang Jie and Bao Xiaoang to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to liquidate the donations. After receiving the order, the staff members have cleared the boat donations with the Wusong Chamber of Commerce and the Wusong Chamber of Commerce has convened representatives of various sand fishing boat owners to negotiate and agree to pay in accordance with the regulations and to set June 1st as the date to start donating.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Business of Empty Land on Qiujiang Road to Open Public Sports Ground <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ziyou Xiehui's Call</p>
<p>In the Zhabei area of ​​this city, there is a large number of poor people, so the sanitation situation is really important and it is harmful to public health, especially to the lives of children. The China Tzu You Xiehui now finds that there is a piece of empty land on the opposite side of Qiujiang Road Chang'an Li, covering an area of ​​more than ten acres. Usually no one manages it, so that garbage is piled up and the smell is offensive. I hereby submit a petition to the Municipal Government Public Security Bureau Social Bureau Education Bureau to jointly ask the landlord to temporarily convert the empty land into a public sports ground to benefit public health. The original text of the petition is as follows: Respectfully, the Zhabei area of ​​Shanghai has a large number of poor people. Most of the residents are laborers, not only lacking sanitation awareness, but also ignorant of children's education. If we do not find a way to promote it, it will be a major shortcoming in spiritual construction. A piece of empty land on the opposite side of Chang'an Li on Qiujiang Road covers an area of ​​more than ten acres. Usually no one manages it, so it is arbitrarily dumped with dirt. When our association held the Zhabei Health Lotus Movement Conference in the area, we once sent a letter to the Public Security and Health Bureaus to investigate and prohibit it, and ordered people to remove human waste. I am afraid that if the ban is relaxed for a long time, the old habits will reappear. It is better to make good use of waste and unite the landlord to temporarily convert the empty land into a public sports ground. All public education and public health events can be held in the area. When the landlord builds a house, he will take it back. It does not encroach on private property, but also pays attention to civic education and maintains public health. Yongbao is clean and beautiful. The head of the city bureau has long seen this and should agree to the request. If you are willing to accept it, please send someone to assist in handling it. Our association will follow the骥尾 and jointly contribute to its completion. Is there anything appropriate? I will wait for your reply. Kong Xiangzhao, Chairman of the Chinese Ciyou Association, respectfully submitted.</p>

<p>Designate a Concurrent Opium Rehabilitation Hospital</p>
<p>The Municipal Health and Public Security Bureaus were instructed by the Municipal Government to designate hospitals that concurrently handle opium rehabilitation matters and establish opium rehabilitation centers. They will send the arrested opium addicts to the hospital to be forced to quit. They are also afraid that the general public of opium addicts are not fully aware of the opium rehabilitation measures and are afraid to move forward, which would be a loss to the central government's spirit of encouraging opium addicts to surrender themselves and quit opium. Therefore, the two bureaus jointly issued a notice on the previous day, stating: For the purpose of the notice, the case was approved by the Municipal Government's 4787th instruction, in which the case was approved by the Anti-Opium Committee to inquire about the hospitals that have been designated to concurrently handle opium rehabilitation matters, the establishment of the city and county opium rehabilitation centers, and the sending of arrested opium addicts to the hospital to be forced to quit. They are also afraid that the general public of opium addicts are not fully aware of the opium rehabilitation measures and are afraid to move forward, which would be a loss to the spirit of the central government's establishment of opium rehabilitation hospitals to encourage opium addicts to surrender themselves and quit opium. In accordance with Article 16 of the Regulations for the Implementation of Anti-Opium Law, opium addicts who voluntarily surrender themselves and are willing to be admitted to the hospital to quit opium or quit opium before being discovered shall be exempt from punishment. The decision was made at the 39th committee meeting of the association and inquired to the governments of all provinces and special cities to announce it to the public so that opium addicts can have the opportunity to voluntarily surrender themselves and be admitted to the hospital to quit opium. In addition to the separate inquiries, the case was recorded and inquired for investigation and compliance, and I hope that you will instruct your subordinates to comply, etc. In addition to the separate orders, the order is hereby ordered to the bureaus to comply and jointly announce it to the public. The list of hospitals that have been designated to handle opium rehabilitation is attached as follows: Public Shanghai Hospital, San Tai Pier, Nanshi; Chinese Red Cross General Hospital, Haige Road, Concession; Southeast Hospital, Hujunying, Nanshi; Civilian Hospital, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei; Jiangsu Opium Rehabilitation Hospital, Zhizaoju Road, Nanshi.</p>

It is a matter of importance for the people and it is difficult to comply. (5) Should personnel be sent to reorganize the work of the Ninth District Women's Association Branch, which has been lax?

After the train arrives at each terminal station, the station master must, together with the brakeman and the car shop inspector, test whether the air pipe is flexible and applicable before the train departs, and record the results of the test in detail for future reference. (2) In order to facilitate the engineering office to have sufficient time before the train to arrange for loading and unloading materials at each station, after the materials are loaded on the train, the station of departure should first fill out the notification before it is determined which train to hang it on. When it is determined which train to hang it on, the train number should be telegraphed. The transportation of these materials should be assisted by the dispatching department to the greatest extent possible to speed up the loading and hanging of the train, and the car should be quickly transferred back to be used for adjustment after the car is empty. Please abide by it. (3) It has been found that train personnel must wear uniforms when on duty. This is a final warning. Anyone who has already received a uniform must wear it when on duty. If there is any violation, the chief of the car affairs section will immediately report it for punishment without leniency.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Results of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Relief Efforts for the Town of Zhenjiang's Cattle Plague <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Last month, a cattle plague broke out in the villages in the Fourth District of Zhenjiang, Qianbei Township. The plague was so rampant that more than 200 cattle died within a few days. The villagers were very panicked and specially submitted a report to the Jiangsu Agricultural and Mining Department requesting that measures be taken to provide relief. The department considered that the Livestock and Product Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau had produced cattle plague serum with good results and provided treatment. It specially commissioned Mr. Zhang Zhenlin to come to Shanghai to contact the bureau. The bureau appointed technician Shou Biao to carry the cattle plague serum to assist the department in injecting it. From July 11th to 18th, the serum was used to inject and treat cattle in various places such as Qianbei Township, Lu Village, Shangluo Village, and Yugan Village in the district. A total of 22 cattle were injected with serum and more than 30 cattle were treated with other methods. A total of more than 50 cattle were cured and the plague was suppressed. The villagers were very grateful. It is reported that the cattle plague serum produced by the bureau is not only purchased by dairy farms near Shanghai, but also by people from as far away as Beijing and Guangzhou who have sent letters to purchase it. Since the demand is high, the production should be increased. Therefore, the bureau is now trying to expand its production capacity to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>○ Jisheng Society Launches Relief Work in Ninghai</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society has successively completed relief work in various counties under the jurisdiction of Taizhou and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province. All counties, including Ninghai and Linhai, have already been budgeted, but no relief work has been carried out. Now, as the summer and autumn flood seasons increase, urgent work on embankments and dikes in various places is of utmost importance. Relief work will start from places like Zhongdu, Xiadu, and Xuepo in Ninghai, and will be carried out quickly. Sun Yinting, the former director of Ninghai relief affairs, will continue to supervise the work. He, along with Li Shuyun and others, took a steamer to Shipu on July 26th, and then went to Ninghai to launch the relief work. The laborers there urgently need relief rice. Fortunately, the society's previous charitable rice sales in Cixi benefited the poor, and the county's harvest is imminent. After the beginning of autumn, there will be no need to continue the charitable rice sales. It is approved that 500 shi of surplus rice will be transported from Ningbo to Shipu for the Zhongdu, Xiadu, and Xuepo relief work in Ninghai, to provide food for the laborers. The transportation will start within days, and Sun Yinting and relief friends will receive and provide the rice. As for the subsidies for various relief projects in Linhai, they have been launched in the Ernan Township in an orderly manner. Wang Huaiqing and Chen Peiqiu of the Linhai Haimen Chamber of Commerce have been entrusted to supervise the work nearby, in order to ensure that the work is solid and the materials are genuine, and that the funds are not wasted, so that the work can effectively protect farmland and prevent disasters.</p>

<p>The Maternal Uncle Was the Mastermind</p>
<p>Relatives Are Truly Unreliable</p>
<p>Chen Yongkang, a four-year-old boy from Huzhou, living at No. 2, Baohua Fang, Huanghe Road, French Concession, was kidnapped and hidden by bandits on the 20th of last month. Afterwards, letters were repeatedly received from the bandits demanding a ransom of 150,000 yuan. It was agreed to negotiate at Ningbo Road, French Concession, at around 8 PM the day before yesterday. However, the matter was discovered by Jin Jiulin, a Chinese detective of the French Concession Police Station. He also used a ruse, disguising himself as a hawker with Vice Detective Mao Jingen and detectives from the robbery squad. He secretly followed Luo Henglin (the maternal uncle of the kidnapped child), who was sent by the Chen family to negotiate. When the time came, three men wearing summer cloth gowns were arrested. The three men confessed that Luo Henglin was the mastermind of the case. Therefore, they were taken to the police station together for strict questioning. They then confessed that Song Hesheng, a Yancheng native, was hiding in Gu's residence at No. 309, Yingchun Fang, Hubei Road. Song was immediately arrested. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after Song was arrested, the location of the kidnapped child was discovered. West Detective Bardi, along with all the detectives, immediately went to the Gordun Road Police Station. The head of the station immediately dispatched several detectives to No. 444, Wuding Fang, Wuding Road, at 3:20 AM yesterday. They rescued the kidnapped child in the shed and arrested the guards, Zhou A'er (18 years old, Sichuan native) and Chang Guang (16 years old, Guangdong native), on the spot. However, no guns were found in the house. The bandits and the kidnapped child were taken to the French Concession Police Station. The family was notified to take the kidnapped child home. The arrested criminals will be sent to the public court for strict investigation.</p>

<p>Claiming the Fake Gun Was Enough to Ward Off Evil</p>
<p>Appears to Be Suffering from a Nervous Disorder</p>
<p>Han Qingtai, a policeman at Post No. 37 of the Gaochangmiao Police Station of the Second District General Station of the Public Security Bureau, and patrolling policeman Han Qingyuan, were on duty in front of the Shanghai Army Fire Brigade at 3:25 AM yesterday. Because a special curfew was announced for the previous two nights and it was late at night, all pedestrians were checked. While the two policemen were patrolling, they suddenly saw a man walking from the west. He was wearing a felt hat and a short padded jacket, looking like a rustic fool. The two policemen went forward to check and found a six-inch revolver fake gun on his body. The model was no different from the real one. Two iron tubes and a pedicure knife were also found in his pocket. He was immediately taken to the station and transferred to the general station. After interrogation by District Chief Wang, he confessed that his name was Wang Diwu, a Songjiang native, 40 years old, currently living with relatives outside Xiaonanmen or lodging in small inns. He also claimed that the fake gun he was carrying was purchased from Yimiao during the first month of the lunar year and was carried on his body to ward off evil. The rest of his words were evasive. District Chief Wang heard that this person was wearing a padded jacket and a felt hat in the hot summer and that his speech was erratic, suggesting that he was suffering from a nervous disorder. However, because he was walking at night during the curfew with a fake gun, there were concerns that he might have other motives. He was immediately transferred to the judicial section for review.</p>

<p>Steals Car and Escapes</p>
<p>Arrested in the French Concession</p>
<p>The Damei Evening News reports that Portuguese man Lu Lailuo of the Jianghai Customs, who lives on Hague Road, took a car to Hongqiao Road last night for business. On the way back, about two miles from the Kaufman General Assembly Hall, a car stopped in front of him, obstructing his driving. It was about 9:30 PM, and it was already dark. As soon as the Portuguese man's car stopped, a man jumped out of the darkness and asked to borrow an air pump. The Portuguese man said he didn't have one and invited him to get in the car and go to a certain place to borrow one. Before he could finish speaking, the man took out a gun and shot at the Portuguese man. Then he tried to shoot the driver. The driver was terrified and ran wildly into the fields. The man failed to catch him and returned to the car, driving at full speed towards the French Concession. The Portuguese man reported the incident to the French Concession Police Station, which immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. About four hours later, the Russian man Chai Valin and his friend Esaike were arrested at No. 532, Avenue Joffre. 102 bullets of various types, a magazine, and three customs badges were found in their car. However, the gun used to shoot the Portuguese man was not on his person. He confessed that he had thrown it away on the way. The Portuguese man's injury was only a graze from the bullet on his left chest muscles, and it was not serious.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Both Were Rescued</p>
<p>Cai Yongde, at the Chunjiang Pier No. 6 ferry in Pudong, on the evening of the day before yesterday at around 5 PM, was loading passengers on the opposite side of the Hankou Road Xinguang Pier and sailing back to Pudong. Just as he arrived in the middle of the river, a passenger with a sad face was about to commit suicide by jumping into the river. Fortunately, a fellow passenger, who claimed to be Wu Yu, working at the High Court, noticed and grabbed him at the critical moment, preventing him from falling into the water. He was escorted to the water patrol police station by the old man Qingyuan. According to his confession, his name is Cai Yongde, and he is 30 years old. He has been married for eight years and has two sons. More than ten years ago, his father worked as a runner at the Xiangtai Lumber Mill in Yangshupu and saved a little money. He bought land in Zhabei Qiujiang Road and built five houses. After his mother died, he remarried to Wang, who soon became estranged from the young couple. Five years ago, they started a small family at No. 898, Jiuruli, Qiujiang Road, upstairs of the Xingyuan South-North Goods Store. He was born as a Western clerk at HSBC Bank and has now been promoted to a small cashier. Although his monthly income is not too small, the family expenses are huge, and the ownership of his father's estate is controlled by his stepmother, who cannot advise the small family. The income cannot cover the expenses, resulting in a high debt. Recently, the rent has also been in arrears for several months. The debtors are pressing from all sides, and he has no way to cope. Therefore, he thought of committing suicide. He left a suicide note at home this morning and handed over the keys to the line. He wandered alone on the roads, hesitating and undecided. Thinking that living would mean owing debts that are difficult to repay temporarily, and that dying would mean not being able to comfort his wife and children, he was caught in a dilemma. After thinking it over again and again, he finally decided to die. Therefore, he planned to commit suicide by jumping into the river. The head of the police verified the confession and ordered Detective Huang Songsheng to summon his wife. She took her husband home that night.</p>
<p>Wang Wenguang, a Ningbo native, 19 years old, with both parents alive, worked in the accounting room on the Anning ship. This year, the ship entered the dock for repairs, and Wang was also laid off. There are three relatives in Shanghai, one is his cousin Wang Lianfu, who works at the Xieji Bookstore on Datong Road, one is his sister Wang, who lives at No. 19, Taide Li, Xinzha, and one is his maternal uncle, who is the old manager at the Yuhua Xiang Machine Shop at No. 488, Oujia Road. Wang also stayed at these three places from time to time. However, being unemployed for a long time, he inevitably felt economically strained. Feeling that he was very uninteresting, he developed a world-weary thought. At around 2 PM yesterday, he took a small ferry from Yongxing Foreign Bank at Nanjing Road Wharf to Pudong. Wang jumped into the water as soon as the ship reached the heart of the river, intending to end his life. The old man Quanlin immediately stopped the ship and rescued him. When asked why he committed suicide, he simply cried. He was sent to the water patrol police station and questioned. Detective Huang Songsheng was dispatched to summon his cousin Wang Lianfu to the police station to take Wang away.</p>

<p>The Public Works Bureau held a regular meeting of directors on Wednesday of this week. The acting accountant submitted a report suggesting that the matter of establishing more parks should be carried out after the Public Works Bureau has made a comprehensive plan for other important matters such as education and hospitals. Although the Public Works Bureau's special budget is expected to have a surplus by the end of this year, there are concerns that unexpected events may occur that require a large amount of money to cope with. The Director-General of the Public Works Bureau also said that a cautious approach should be taken. Although the sale of the electrical department can provide 30 million taels of silver to meet the needs, if about 8 million taels are used each year, the money will be exhausted in a few years, and the Public Works Bureau will be in a difficult situation again. The Board of Directors greatly praised the proposal for comprehensive financial planning. The Director-General stated that he also considered the construction of a park in the northern district to be an important task and that it could be started. A Director suggested that the Public Works Department should first make a detailed report on the area and the amount of money that could be obtained from the sale of the Public Works Bureau's surplus land, and then make a decision. At that time, the money from the sale of land could be used to purchase land for the construction of the park. Everyone then agreed with this proposal.</p>

<p>○ The deadline for registration of the Shanghai South District Guard Corps has been extended to the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai South District Guard Corps revised its organization, it began to handle the registration of members. The deadline was the 28th of last month. Because the number of registered members in each team reached more than 700, and the quota set by the organization was not yet full, the corps decided to extend the deadline by one day to allow the members to complete the registration and avoid missing the opportunity.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Imprisoned for Bigamy and Accused of Seeking Alimony <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Wu Fuzhen Demands 7,200 Yuan</p>
<p>Wu Fuzhen, a woman from Suzhou, previously sued her husband Gao Jin, a gentry, for bigamy in the local court. It was alleged that she was introduced to Gao Jin as a second wife by a matchmaker on the tenth day of the tenth lunar month last year. Unexpectedly, after entering the door, she learned that the defendant's legal wife, Wu, was still in the home. The marriage location was at the China Hotel on Er Ma Road. The defendant denied the marriage, claiming that he paid 200 yuan to take the plaintiff as a concubine and did not formally marry her. The defendant's wife, Wu, also testified in court, saying that she could not have children due to illness, so she asked her husband to take a concubine for the sake of continuing the family line. After the court ordered the hotel waiter and the wedding equipment store owner to testify in court, it was proven that there was indeed a marriage ceremony. Therefore, Gao Jin was sentenced to three months' imprisonment for bigamy. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that Wu Fuzhen has hired lawyer Chen Wenzhao to petition the civil court for alimony for 20 years, totaling 7,200 yuan (calculated at 30 yuan per month), as well as clothing and other items worth 407 yuan. Judge Zhang Jinjian held a court hearing yesterday. He first telephoned the Caohejing Second Prison and sent the defendant Gao Jin to the court. According to the plaintiff Wu Fuzhen, she is a native of Suzhou, residing at No. 11, Anxiang Li, Datong Road, Zhabei, and provided a brief account of the previous situation, requesting alimony of 30 yuan per month.

<p>Alone in the world, a bleak future</p>
<p>At around 9 PM the day before yesterday, a girl of about thirteen or fourteen years old was seen on Bailinan Road in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, wearing an old white calico shirt, black calico trousers, bare feet, and blue cloth shoes, wandering and crying miserably. A patrolling police officer noticed her and questioned her. Discovering that she was lost, the officer took her back to the 6th District Police Station. After questioning by District Chief Ren, the girl stated her name was Wu Guiying, thirteen years old, from Wuxi. She had come to Shanghai with her mother several years ago and worked in a Yangshupu cotton mill for seven months before returning home in the winter. Last year, her father suddenly died in mid-March, and her mother passed away in early October. She only has an older brother named Wenbing, twenty-two years old, who is not yet married. Because the family was very poor, they lacked the funds for coffins and burials and had to borrow from relatives to barely manage. Her brother had no job and wandered around at home, causing the siblings to live in dire straits. In March of this year, her brother suddenly left without saying goodbye. Neighbors, seeing her loneliness, took turns providing food to fill her stomach. A month later, her brother sent her a letter saying he had joined the army and gone north. Afterwards, she asked neighbors going to Shanghai if they would take her to Shanghai, saying she had an aunt (mother's sister) there and could find her and live with her. Because she was truly in distress, a neighbor agreed to bring her to Shanghai on the 29th of last month. They stayed overnight in a Yangshupu workshop, and the neighbor woman gave her four small silver coins to hire a rickshaw to Zhoujiaqiao to find her aunt. Unfortunately, the houses there had already been demolished and moved long ago. Having spent all her money and not knowing the way, she got lost. Recalling that her aunt (surnamed Wu) was nowhere to be found and her livelihood was cut off, she burst into tears. When asked for the neighbor's surname, she said she didn't know, only that they lived in the Yihe workshop in Yangshupu. District Chief Ren, feeling sorry for the girl's plight, decided to temporarily keep her at the station while they tried to find her aunt to claim her.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government yesterday received an order from the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Hall stating, "Regarding compliance with orders: A previous order from the Ministry of Interior stated that, concerning the issue of civilian food supplies, the Ministry has repeatedly issued orders to the civil affairs halls of various provinces to prohibit the export of rice and flour and to report on a timely basis for verification. Now, the difficulty of civilian food supplies has reached its extreme. The reason for this is both the result of poor harvests and the manipulation and raising of grain prices by unscrupulous merchants, as well as various improper consumptions, which should be strictly investigated and prohibited to avoid food shortages. At the same time, it should be quickly ordered that the subordinates prepare funds to carry out price stabilization in order to address both aspects. In addition to sub-issuing, it is necessary to reiterate the previous order, urging the hall to quickly comply and order its subordinates to earnestly handle the matter and report on the compliance situation for verification.

Prosecutor Liu opened the court and stated that if a re-examination is required, the body must be dissected by a forensic doctor. You are neither a direct nor collateral relative of the deceased, and you have no right to sue. Unduly dissecting a complete corpse with no relative bearing the responsibility is deliberately obstructing the process. In this hot weather, there are sanitation concerns. The body should be embalmed as soon as possible. If you are dissatisfied with the examination, you can find the deceased's family members to file a complaint, and the coffin can still be opened for re-examination. He was then dismissed.</p>

<h3 id="e189">Preliminary Issues in Aiding the People's Food Supply <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>China is vast in territory, densely populated, and rich in resources. Since ancient times, agriculture has been the foundation of the country, with about 70% to 80% of the population engaged in agriculture. In the past, when agriculture in Europe, America, and Japan had not yet reached full development, China's exports of agricultural products were very large. In modern times, due to the development of science and the dedication to research and improvement, agriculture in various countries has flourished and progressed rapidly. Looking back at China, not only has there been no progress in thousands of years, but it has also declined daily. Even the most important food staples for people's livelihood, such as rice, wheat, and flour, still rely on foreign countries. Other minor agricultural products have seen even greater declines in production. According to customs reports, rice imported from Saigon, Ceylon, and other places reaches more than ten million yuan per year. If such a huge leak is not remedied, its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood will be very serious. China's land area and population are ten or a hundred times greater than other countries. Why is there no panic of food shortages in other countries, while China, which claims to be an agricultural advanced nation, has such backward production? This is a value for extensive study. The reason for the development of agriculture in Europe, America, and Japan is due to material civilization, which China does not have. Another major reason is that farmers can use scientific methods to improve agriculture. We have learned from the rapid advances in agriculture in Europe, America, and Japan that in this age of scientific prosperity, stagnation will lead to elimination. Without actively improving to seek production development, there is no way to solve all the difficulties of people's livelihood. However, the path to improvement has myriad aspects and cannot be achieved overnight. Where should we start? The only way is to choose what is easy and quick to take effect and start first, which is to improve fertilizer. The fertilizers used by Chinese farmers to cultivate crops are soybeans, animal manure, river mud, and grass ash. However, the most important nutrients for plants, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, are mostly insufficient in these fertilizers, which affects the prosperity of plants and the harvest. Agricultural experts in various countries know that these fertilizers cannot obtain a full harvest, so they have conducted precise research and invented chemical fertilizers (i.e., fertilizer powder) to supplement the deficiencies of natural fertilizers. The effect is grand, the procedure is simple, and it is very economical. If it is combined with soybeans, the effect is even greater. Therefore, fertilizer powder occupies an extremely important position in agriculture today and is recognized as the only essential product for increasing production. Foreign farmers have used it for a long time with remarkable results. The abundance of agricultural products in various countries today must be attributed to fertilizer powder. It is a pity that Chinese farmers pay little attention to it. China's population was claimed to be 400 million several years ago. With years of reproduction, the increase in population has exceeded this number. On the one hand, the population is increasing daily, and on the other hand, production should also increase to avoid supply exceeding demand, and life will not feel any hardship. But now we only see the daily increase in population and do not see the increase in production. With more needs and insufficient supply, there is a panic of food shortages. The current unstable state of society and the rice price rising to more than twenty yuan per stone make people across the country feel the pain of living hard, which is due to the fundamental reduction in production. If we do not vigorously develop the production aspect at this time, not only will the problem of food shortages not be solved, but the national economy and social peace will also be greatly affected. Lion Horse Brand Fertilizer Powder is a famous German specialty with excellent quality and great effectiveness. If it is used together with domestic natural fertilizers to cultivate various crops, they will be prosperous and fruitful. This fertilizer powder has been inspected and certified by the Agricultural Products Inspection Institute of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and is recognized as beneficial to agricultural crops and harmless to the soil. Now that production is decreasing and there is a domestic food shortage, I hope that my comrades in the agricultural field will rise up and advocate the use of this fertilizer powder to increase production and relieve food shortages. This is the task at hand.</p>

<h3 id="e194">School Life <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>In the modern trend, all new developments in civilization, no matter which aspect, are centered on cities. The only city in China is Shanghai. In terms of culture, Shanghai should be the birthplace of national culture. Just looking at the various publications that spring up like bamboo shoots after rain can represent this. Especially in recent years, the craze for illustrated publications. Not to mention anything else, even the old Shen Bao, like Old Master Q, has responded to the trend and published Illustrated Shen Bao. Xinwen Bao is of course not to be outdone. Other newspapers may not be able to achieve this goal temporarily due to economic reasons, but they do not necessarily lack this hope. As for the publication of illustrated magazines, there are even more of them. In the modern trend of civilization, publications without pictures seem unable to represent the spirit of the times. To put it a bit too strongly, it seems a bit outdated and backward. Readers, I hope you can believe it. We only need to pay attention to the publications that our young people read, and it is not difficult to prove. If you don't believe me, let's try to go into the dormitories of various universities and visit them. In addition to textbooks, reference books, and books that are rich in research, various illustrated magazines and various pictorials have almost become essential pastimes. "If our young people don't open literary publications or picture publications to read, then the life they live will be too boring.</p>
<p>Among the various illustrated publications, I love to read two kinds. One is the "School Life" that I am introducing today, and the other is "White Goose." I will introduce the latter at another time. Now I will only talk briefly about the former. She is a weekly publication. She has been produced for nine issues. What does she look like beautifully? How rich is the content? How sophisticated is the printing? How exquisite is the binding? Fortunately, there is evidence, so I don't need to be long-winded. What I want to introduce is the recently published ninth issue.</p>
<p>I don't just love the four-color plate cover photo. I love the words "School Life" and "schooILife" in white letters with blue borders, set against a silver background, which are "bright and eye-catching", making people feel a poetic beauty at first sight. An extremely beautiful color plate photo of Ms. Liu Liuying of Guanghua University. This photo is excellent. The rose and black colors are set off. I dare to say that not many of the color plates in Shanghai's various picture publications can surpass her. Here, a question worthy of study arises. The editors of this publication must have sufficient knowledge of art. Mr. Ji Xiaobo, the editor of this publication, is a painter, so the printing of "School Life" can surpass others.</p>
<p>This issue's cover features several photos of Ms. Chen Yuejun in various poses, most of which are full of enthusiasm and can be used as a reference for a group of ladies who love to take pictures. There is also a photo of "Female Poet Yu Xiuyun Visiting Tin," which is quite poetic and worthy of being a female poet's photo. In terms of illustrations, such as human body art, color plates, and humorous satirical paintings, they are all very eye-catching. Let's talk about the text.</p>
<p>The graduation song on the first page is necessary to introduce. Not only is the combination of Chinese and Western characters clever, but it is also timely. Isn't it the summer vacation now? Graduating students must like it very much after hearing it. Listen to it.</p>
<p>Everyone, don't be depressed. Please drink iced soda and sing the happy graduation song below.</p>
<p>Life is originally a Play</p>
<p>Why Bother to Study Day and Night</p>
<p>As Long as the Score Can Pa s</p>
<p>Diploma in Hand and Happy</p>
<p>The new poetry should be Ms. Qingli's "We are Two Bright Stars" and "Give One," which are very natural and good poems. Guangmei's "Our Old Master Q" is the most humorous text. I dare to guarantee that anyone who reads it will laugh or spit rice. The content is too long, so I will not copy the beginning and leave it for the readers to read for themselves. "Group Rule a Prodigal Woman," the author said at the end: "After writing this matter, I really don't know why. How about her theory? Please discuss it." Indeed, I feel the same way, and I still have to ask the readers to study it. There are also many news from various schools, so I will not write more.</p>
<p>I heard that the content of the next issue of this publication is even richer and will have a format similar to a literary special issue. Let's wait patiently. (Guangmei)</p>
<h3 id="e195">Dean of Students and Empress of Datong University <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Datong University, which rents houses and relies on loans for food, has, through the efforts of founder Ou Yuanhuai and the students of the school, in the spirit of cooperation between teachers and students, built new school buildings on Fanwangdu, such as Qunxian Hall, Qunce Zhai, Qunli Zhai, and Qunying Zhai. The buildings are magnificent and magnificent. Although the equipment in the material aspect cannot be said to be above all universities in the country, it can also be comparable. It has the model of the highest institution of learning, and other facilities such as the library are being expanded, and the science museum and gymnasium are also being planned. The number of students is expected to be more than 1,500 in the next semester. The gathering of heroes can be described as a grand event. In addition to the sporadic disclosures of the school's news in various newspapers, the problem of the school's dean of students and the empress is of great concern to the general students. It is learned that Mr. Zhu Zhangbao, the dean of students of the school, is good at eloquence and communication, and is very modest in dealing with people. Since taking office, teachers and students have been at peace, and any disputes have been resolved easily. Now, due to various problems, he suddenly resigned. Although the school affairs meeting decided to retain him and President Ou sincerely persuaded him, Mr. Zhu insisted on resigning because he was hired by the Faculty of Law and Politics (as the dean of students). However, the students of the school speculate on the selection of his successor. According to reliable information, there is a rumor that Mr. Yu Zhihan, the director of the school's preparatory course, will take on the role concurrently. As for the empress problem, because the school's girls' dormitory was originally in West Shanghai, it has long been known as the West Palace (opposite Fudan's East Palace). Although the empress's selection has not been formally voted on in the past, all the students have generally recognized Ms. Zhang Yuanhe. Ms. Zhang has graduated during the summer vacation and is preparing to go to the United States next spring. Therefore, the empress problem in the next semester has become a topic of discussion among the school's students. It is heard that Yu Xiuyun, a new student who was admitted to this year's first year, is the granddaughter of Mr. Yu Qiaqing. Ms. Yu graduated from the Patriotic Girls' School this summer. Ms. Yu's appearance is extremely beautiful in the East, and the new literature has long been famous at sea. I met a member of the school's student union who stayed at the school yesterday and asked about the two matters. According to him, there is indeed a saying that Yu Zhihan is the dean of students. Mr. Yu has no ill will towards the students, but he is not very close and is not a party member. It is difficult to predict whether it will be determined in the future. As for the empress problem, the female students will be very enthusiastic in the next semester, and there will be no lack of candidates (because there is now a saying in the school that the summer school is prosperous and the female students are flourishing). Although the students have long admired Ms. Yu's noble style, they have no chance to meet her. Therefore, whether she can be elected must depend on her attitude towards the students before a decision can be made. I would like to offer what I have learned to the readers, and I think it will be a pleasure to hear it. (Xiangmin)</p>
<h3 id="e196">Chinese Student Wins American Poetry Prize <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The "Los Angeles Times" of the United States holds a literary award essay contest every year to reward contributors. This year, Mr. Lee Sbippey, the editor of the poetry section of the newspaper, specially reviewed the works published in the section and rigorously selected from 600 submissions. The first prize was awarded to Zhao Yuanzhang, a Chinese student. The others were novelists, veterans, and police officers. Zhao Yuanzhang's poem has an atmosphere of the American mystery writer Edgar Allan Poe, which was highly appreciated by the editor. However, the poem begins with himself sitting alone in a room dreaming with a sad tone, and ends with "the wind brings me the flowers of death", which seems to be a groan that Chinese youth should not be uttering in a foreign country.

<p>Xinjiang Snapshots</p>
<p>Xinjiang is located on the frontier, with abundant resources, a mild climate, and a peaceful order, free from the disasters of war. Its people enjoy a life of peace. The land is coveted by England and Russia, and internal strife is endless. This pure land has not yet enjoyed a moment of peace. From the Han and Tang Dynasties, there were connections with the Western Regions. The Qing Dynasty suppressed the Hui people, not hesitating to waste manpower and resources, because Xinjiang is not only a defensive perimeter, but also related to the overall situation of Europe and Asia. This spring, Zhu Xiting, the secretary of the Xinjiang Provincial Education Department and director of the Tonghua Library, traveled to the Pingjin, Shanghai, and Hangzhou areas for several months. After that, he spent four months in the desert taking photographs. He has now safely returned to his hometown. Many photos have been sent. Here are some important ones. It is hoped that those who feel responsible for the rise and fall of the nation will take note of these preparations. (Zhang Jianbai)</p>
<p>(1) Sheep Herds: Although Xinjiang was once the ancient homeland of the Xiongnu, and is now regarded as a border region of the country, the residents are engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry. In the northern regions of Yili and Tacheng, the situation is such that the Kyrgyz, Bulut and other tribes are nomadic people who live by moving according to water and grass. Even in the areas near Bortala, although they are engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry, they are more inclined towards animal husbandry. Therefore, most people in Xinjiang, except for a small number of Han people living in the upper classes, rely on animal husbandry for clothing and food. This has remained unchanged since ancient times. The area is located in the Kunlun Mountains, the source of ten thousand waters. Looking out over the vast plains and green grass, it is a natural pasture. In the past, the profits from agriculture in Xinjiang Province were said to be several times higher than those of other provinces, but the profits from animal husbandry are even several times higher than those of agriculture. This is indeed not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>(2) Fur Clothing for Travel: When traveling to Xinjiang, it is necessary to wear fur clothing and hats as the weather gradually changes when traveling west. Otherwise, it will be impossible to withstand the cold. Photo by Zhu Xiting.</p>
<p>(3) Transportation: Xinjiang is located on the extreme border, compounded by the obstruction of water, mountains, deserts, and quicksand. Therefore, transportation is extremely difficult and time-consuming, unparalleled even in a journey around the world. Moreover, the benefits of boats and trains are useless. One can only rely on horses and mule carts for transportation. The only animal that can bear heavy loads and travel long distances is the camel. The progress of society and the development of civilization are greatly influenced by transportation.</p>
<p>(4) Camel Shade: Who is traveling in the desert, seeking shade?</p>
<p>(5) Agriculture: Farms extend over 20,000 li, nearly four times the size of Sichuan, and several times larger than Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Thirty to forty percent of the land consists of towering mountains and valleys. The remaining area is vast wilderness with abundant water and grass. Even without rain, the land is fertile and the climate is moderate. The northern region is comparable to the Tianjin area, while the climate in the two regions is temperate, making them suitable for agriculture like the regions south of the Yangtze River. Currently, only over 13 million mu of land are cultivated, mainly producing wheat, barley, and sorghum, followed by rice. The photo above shows the Dihua North Agricultural Experiment Station, introducing scientific farming methods. Hong Yongwu, a former Tuntian official in Turpan and Kashgar, also introduced agricultural benefits.</p>
<p>(6) Jade Tablet: The tablet is located outside the north gate of Zhenxi City. It was built in the second year of the Han Dynasty's Heping era and is of great historical value.</p>
<p>(7) Fishing: Bosten Lake is the largest lake in the southern part of Xinjiang Province. People use dugout canoes to fish in it.</p>
<p>(8) Gathering Firewood: Travelers gather firewood in the wilderness to prepare meals.</p>
<p>(9) Forests: Xinjiang is located on a high plateau with undulating mountains and dense forests. The Tianshan Mountains stretch for over a thousand li from Qitai to Barkol in the north, covered entirely with pine and fir trees. The Mingduo Wannian Pine and the Barluk Mountains of Tacheng extend for over two hundred li, filled with pines and firs. The shade of the Kunlun Mountains is also covered with pine, elm, and poplar trees. Although nature is generous, human efforts are lacking. In Yili and Tacheng, which are close to Russia, the logging has been going on for ten years with no regard for restrictions. Recently, a timber company has been established in an attempt to control logging, but due to insufficient capital and inconvenient transportation, the results are poor. This picture shows a glimpse of the Tianshan forests.</p>

Recently, someone opened an ABC ice cream shop, which is organized in a very American style. People from the literary and artistic circles often gather there.</p>
