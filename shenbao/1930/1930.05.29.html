<p>日本以三十九對二十四勝中</p>
<p>裁判員不公評大罰我國</p>
<p>東京通訉二十四日下午七時半中日籃球隊開始接觸中國方面就技術而論似較日本稍高一䉒故事前　以爲操必勝之權未免稍加大意初不料竟以三十九對二十四敗北中國隊出馬不利籃球錦標大受影響惜哉但是日裁判員之不公爲有目共睹之事最初開賽之三分鐘時中國隊竟被罰至七次之多實爲籃球史上所未見我國隊員精神因之大受挫折但猶能始終忍受並無任何不規則情事發生體育仁俠之精神表演日足勝負何足論日方裁判員之偏袒是暴露其本身之弱點也茲將比賽經過詳述如下</p>
<p>球塲之盛况是晚球場之擁擠爲空前所未有最少亦在萬五千人左右無票不得進場立候門外聽消息又近數千人新聞記者席上更爲擁擠攝影者十餘人時時以鎂光照相隆然之聲頻聞耳鼓空氣之緊張可謂逹於極點</p>
<p>拉拉隊熱心我國留學生及僑民等所組織之拉拉隊是晚全部蒞場散處四隅不下千餘人我隊一舉一動歡聲雷動愛國熱誠殊堪飲佩拉拉隊均手持小國旗有帶紅帽穿白制服者以中華中華中華萬歲爲普遍的口號領袖一呼應聲四起極爲熱閙</p>
<p>連頭五球開戰之初我方氣勢强盛姚恩漢與唐寳琨之聨絡極爲活潑使日方奔走應付頗感困難但裁判員竟於最初之三分鐘内罰我五次罰中者三遂以三對零佔先當時觀衆已大抱不平頗有騷動情狀幸我隊員處以鎭靜戒衆勿噪且看顔色</p>
<p>姚唐施威至是小將軍唐寳琨與滿地滚姚恩漢大奮神威各攻進二球乃以八對三獲勝軍勢大振不料罰球之令又至遂使勇將不敢拚命全軍畏縮是爲是晚致敗之第一原因上半時我隊遂以十二比十五敗北</p>
<p>大勢去矣檸檬時間後我隊仍以原陣線出戰日本則以田中爲中將植田爲前鋒軍勢益盛第二分鐘時被植田連續由中線外攻進二球紀錄相差益遠中將劉建常次次躍球均爲日方奪去小將軍唐審琨之擲籃亦失其平日準確能力李國琛王錫良之内銜亦時出漏洞時時爲敵人所乘於是軍心互解大勢去矣</p>
<p>陣線更動其後日隊分數續續增加雙方紀錄愈距愈遠我隊敎練董守義君急忙更動陣線以王玉增爲中將魏蓬雲陣盛魁爲前鋒以陸鐘恩易王錫良爲内銜然亦無濟於事後半時我隊復以十二對廿四失敗總結果三十九對二十四日本隊勝</p>

<h3 id="c134">明日五卅慘案紀念 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>召集紀念大會</p>
<p>舉行公祭典禮</p>
<p>市宣傳部之規定辦法</p>
<p>五卅慘案爲英日帝國主義聨合屠殺中紀念五卅慘案應有的認識和努力（一）五卅慘案是起因於民國十四年二月間上海日人所開設的内外紗廠壓追我國工人釀成罷工更用高壓手段槍殺工人顧正紅因而激起我國覺悟工人和愛國學生參加本黨反抗帝國主義的運動於五月卅日在上海公共租界舉行盛大的反帝國主義的宣傳和示威由帝國主義者的捕頭英人愛活生令巡捕開槍殘殺我愛國徒手民衆的一幕慘劇自五月卅日起至六月五日止我國同胞慘死者十一人重傷者八人輕傷者十餘人接着各地爲援助上海的民衆南京廣州九江重慶等地又發生同樣慘案</p>
<p>（二）我們總括五卅初爲援助五卅而接續發生的各慘案的原因和事實來觀察可以得到以下的結論（一）帝團主義者對我國國民革命運動是一致的之屠殺（二）至少在這個共同利害的觀點上是聨合的（三）帝國主義者對中國國民革命運動施用屠殺政策是始終一貫的從五卅到現在都是堅持着的這是我們要深深認識的</p>
<p>（三）五卅是本黨總理所領導的是國民革命運動直接與帝國主義者肉搏的紀念當時帝國主義者看見中國民族的自覺不由得恐慌起來於是不惜違背公理與人道用屠殺政策以維持他所取得的不合理的不平等條約的優越權利然而事實上我國國民革命運動只有因此而日見進展我國的民衆只有因此而日見覺梧而集中於本黨旗幟之下最短期間完成北伐消滅了帝國主義者的爪牙撼動了帝國主義者在華侵略政策的基礎的進展</p>
<p>（四）從五卅以後國民革命勢力在打倒軍閥及撼動帝國主義基礎的進展當中已益發證明帝國主義者利用軍閥或軍閥勾結帝國主義者以備破壤革命的進展都是要失敗的在去歲一年中勾結帝國主義者而叛黨禍國的有馮桂張唐諸逆的失敗更是顯明的事實最近閻逆錫山又步馮桂張唐的後塵起而危害革命進展動摇黨國基礎他的失敗是我們可以預見的惟當其未消滅以前我們要本着五卅烈士殉難的精神擁護中央剷除閻逆永遠銷滅帝國主義者利用侵略中國的工具新舊軍閥努力廢除不平等條約打倒一切帝國主義以完成國民革命的使命</p>
<p>（五）五卅是本黨領導民衆反抗帝國主義的悲壯歷史之一幕故紀念五卅必須要在本黨所指定的地方去熟烈的舉行要制裁一切反革命份子和假借民衆出賣革命的共產黨和改組派要誓死在三民主義的原則下與帝國主義作英勇的鬥爭附標語（一）五卅是帝國主義者屠殺中國民衆的紀念日（二）屠殺中國是帝國主義最後的掙抗（三）以國民革命的力量戰勝帝國主義者的一切行動（四）繼續五卅烈士殉難的精神（五）打倒一切帝國主義廢除不平等條約（六）保障革命利益肅清軍閥餘逆閻錫山馮玉祥（七）中國國民黨萬歲（八）中華民國萬歲</p>

<p>輸出不振市價大落</p>
<p>减資减工似爲要策</p>
<p>工人準備罷工相抗</p>
<p>二十七日大阪電日本紡廠現採用短時工制以期縮减棉紗之產額而維持市價衆料除現有减率百分之十七外棉紗產額將自七月一日起再减百分之十查現有棉紗出產額每月爲二十二萬七千包目前紗價至臻一九一六年後之最低價因國内外利於缺方之原因甚多如紡織物輸出之倐然减少即其一也棉紗存底雖不過分豐厚但棉布存底則迅見增加工資之積極裁减或廠工之大批裁撤殆爲遲早間莫可避免之事也故工會領袖刻正準備一切以期用罷工方法舉此情况相奮鬥云</p>
<p>按日本三品紗價近月來迅速下降最低跌至一百三十九元爲一九一六年來之新低價蓋日本紡業自政府明令决定於一九二九年七月一日廢止深夜工後各廠爲避免因廢止深夜工而發生减少產額起見努力增加紡機故自此項制度實行後棉紗產額聚增每月逹二十六萬餘包造成新紀錄濱江内閣成立爲金解禁而實行緊縮政策金融界實極大打擊棉紗内地銷路因之遲滯海外輸出又復不振當業者又倡議减工以期减少產額詎日紗布唯一市塲之中國以當地日廠之競爭銷路减退至印度方面於四月間一致通過棉貨關稅增加案將棉貨進口稅從百分之十一增至百分之十五又對於厞英貨於三年内增收百分之五日本棉業界爲之震驚雖百般設法終未見效致内外贸易又陷於窮困狀態中各廠不得已除取用减資方法外復從事於减工運動如第一流之鐘紡大罷工即爲减少工資所引起也由此可見日本紡織業之困頓矣頃據上電所述則日本紡織業前途頗爲暗瞻也</p>

<p>很出於大家意料之外的（基督傳）（Storia　di　Cristo）的作者巴比尼(Gioaanni　Papini）突然出版了一部新著（聖奥格斯丁(Dant　Agostino)我們都知道聖奥格斯丁是天主敎大偉人他的事蹟曾引動了世界各國無數的作家和家者關於他的書已經多得很了法國的吉爾孫（Etienne-Gilson）在不久以前就出過一本（聖奥格丁研究導言）(Intro</p>
<p>dution　a　lietrde　Saint　Augustin)</p>
<p>如今巴比尼也來了這麽一部（聖奥格斯丁（他是不是因爲現在的那種浪漫的傳記所謂（新傳記文學）正盛極一時所以也來趁趁熱閙呢然而不巴比尼並不是受了這種誘惑當然他要照時髦的辦法來做自然很容易因爲聖奥格斯丁不但是一位大（聖人）而且也是一位大（凡人）他一生事蹟之中的浪漫成分是足足可以做一部浪漫傳記的豐富資料的但是巴比尼决不肯這麽辦我們要知道巴比尼是生性喜歡爭論的他永遠是反對當代輿論底潮流的而且在他自己眼裏巴比尼簡直是一個創造之主般的人物革命的毁滅的激勵的創造的又是英雄又是改革家又是聖人又是曾經想（替地行道）地用了第一身少數來寫（基督傳）的所以當他寫完了（基督傳）以後再來寫（奥格斯丁傳）實在是勢所必然的因爲他對於文學歷史向來抱一種親切的個人的自傳的見解况且作（懺悔錄）的這位聖人和作（基督傳）的這位作家在精神方面是頗有相同之處的聖奥格斯丁是一個條辭學家拉丁語學家文法學家新柏拉圖派哲學家和喜發奇論的作家對於一切是不滿意到底的他是一面鏡子在那鏡子裏照出了巴比尼不過比巴比尼要大些就是了巴比尼自己就毫不隱藏地告訴讀者</p>
<p>在我看起來我們之間似乎有某一種的相椽之處存在着他也是一個文人和文字的愛好者並且是一個被騷擾的哲學和眞理的創造者甚至爲（神秘學）（Occultism）所誘惑他又是肉慾的冀求名譽的我像他自然是像了他的最壞的地方但無論如何我總是像他的</p>
<p>聖奥格斯丁起先是一個罪人後來成爲一個聖人巴比巴對於他一向是具有深厚的同情的但單單祇有這一種同情巴比尼底寫（聖奥格斯丁）理由還是不充足要不是因爲除了西人性情相似以外他們之間還有一個很重要很深切的關連這關連就是他們都是天主敎的著作家而且都是經過了心靈上的重大動摇以後才信仰轉變歸向了天主敎於是在實騐過無數量智識的眞理以後才得到最後的靈的安寗在我們看起來這本書就是巴比尼底答案問題是（巴比尼你爲什麽要轉信天主敎呢）巴比尼似乎回答說（你看這個人他比　偉大得多了你看他怎樣選擇他的路徑我没有做什麽不過是步他的復塵罷了）</p>
<p>················</p>
<p>在本書底自序裏巴比尼把他倒這本書底目的鄭重聲明了</p>
<p>我的目的是要用最大的質樸來重述這個偉大的非洲人底外在的和内心的生活明明白白地指示出來確鑒的事實到那里爲止或然的揣想從那里開始自然這並不是把那本（懺悔錄）再逐句的解釋一遍因爲那本書到底是說到三十三歲時就没有繼續下去了可是這本書的本意也並不是要來完完全全地說明這位大聖人底思想因爲不要說是他思想底全部就是大概地說一說他的哲學他的神學或是他的神秘學每一種也就要此這本書篇幅還要大些所以我的意思只是要來說一說一個靈魂的故事</p>
<p>但是我們讀過這本書以後我們不能不說巴比尼所給我們的解釋有點不很能使人信服因爲一般的讀者寗願巴比尼很坦白的從兩條路裏挑選一條來走或者是純然創造出一件藏術作品來像他的盛名所要求的或者就是寫一部關於這題目的歷史可是現在這兩條路巴比尼一條都不走他現在的這部作品能是稍微能引起我們的注意但是並不能使我們用心地去讀熱心地去讀至於奥格斯丁底靈魂呢他雖說要寫這靈魂底歷史但却很少描寫到這個靈魂描寫到的時候確是描寫得很有力無奈他太愛寫到情慾了尤其是那些卑劣的情慾自然從這地方我們也可以看出巴比尼很像奥格斯丁似的溺愛肉體的情慾喜歡時常談到它們然而這和他自己的聲明到底是有些矛盾了</p>
<p>畢竟是（盛名難當）他的地位太高了讀者們對於他的冀望未免太大他在這本書裏所給我們的確實和我們希望從這本書裏得到的相差很多他給我們的旣不是羅曼司可不是歷史而是一幅正宗嫡派的圖畫畫出了一位聖人底生活和他所生活的時代用一種沉靜輕靈的風格寫了出來在這本書裏自然也有幾頁寫得很美的璧如最後的那一章</p>

<h3 id="e3">Hungary to Establish a Formal Monarchy <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, this reporter discussed Austria's unstable political situation due to the power struggle between parties. Today, Hungary's political situation is also about to change due to a dispute over the throne. This matter is also greatly related to the rise and fall of European democratic politics.</p>
<p>Since Hungary separated from Austria and King Karl of Austria abdicated, Hungary has become a republican independent country. First, Gavelli was elected as the temporary president, then overthrown by the left wing, and replaced by the labor and peasant government. Not long after, the right wing overthrew the labor and peasant government again and appointed General Horthy as the temporary head of state. Horthy originally belonged to the Austrian warlords and had extensive connections. King Karl of Austria attempted to restore the throne twice, but was prevented by Horthy. Therefore, Horthy's power grew day by day, and all power was concentrated in one person. He implemented a dictatorial political system with a puppet monarch, which is what is called the temporary regent today. At that time, the reason for advocating a monarchical political system was simply to use the name of a constitutional monarchy to continue the regency. However, Archduke Albrecht of the Habsburg dynasty rose up to compete for the throne with Crown Prince Otto of Hungary, and the form of government was also delayed for a long time. According to the telegram, the Archduke, due to a woman, has given up his struggle for the throne and expressed his sincerity to Crown Prince Otto. The parliament will pass the abolition of the temporary regency system, invite the Crown Prince to take the throne, and implement a monarchical political system. Hungary's transformation from a republic to a monarchy will thus be determined.</p>
<p>We can note two things in this telegram. One is that the Crown Prince of Hungary is engaged to the youngest princess of the Italian Emperor, and the engagement will be announced through the introduction of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Hungarian Regent Horthy. Hungary's regency politics is already close to dictatorship. Now that Hungary and Italy have marital relations, their political views will naturally be more harmonious. The so-called "Italianization" policy of intimidation will not be difficult to implement in Hungary. The other is that Czech newspapers have expressed opposition to Hungary's change of head of state, saying that neighboring countries will have repercussions. The Slavic people have long been jealous of Hungary, and the establishment of the Little Entente was to monitor Hungary. In the past, when Karl attempted to restore the throne twice, each of the Little Entente had severe opposition. Now, if the monarchical regime is confirmed, and its strength is consolidated and gradually developed, it will be enough to threaten the countries of Central Europe. How can they not be alarmed? These are all factors that greatly affect the future of the European situation.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Xuchang and Weishi Hope to Maintain Xinzheng and Cover Retreats. During the meeting, Lu Zhonglin stated that Yan [Xishan] is helpless, so why bother the troops? Feng telegraphed Yan on the 27th, instructing him to come to Zhengzhou quickly, but Yan has not yet replied. (2) Feng secretly arrived in Zhengzhou. Because the Jin army suffered a disastrous defeat on the Longhai Railway line, and Taikang and Lanfeng were successively surrounded by the National Army, he was very panicked and prepared to retreat. Also, on the Pinghan front, the various units of the Third Army Corps annihilated most of Fan's bandit troops in Xuchang this morning and will soon occupy Xinzheng. Within five days, the rebel army north of Xuchang can be completely eliminated and Zhengzhou recovered. Aircraft northwest of Lanfeng were shot down by Central aircraft and fled. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Luohe, 28th: (1) Fan Zhongxiu and Liu Guitang, seeing that the overall situation in the north is gone, sent personnel to surrender. He Chengjun, considering their fickle nature, ignored them. Wang Jinyu and others personally came to the front lines to command military affairs. He Chengjun sent Zhu Chuanjing, Hu Yimin, and others to various places to comfort the troops. Zhu has gone to Wuyang and Fangcheng for work. (2) At Qilitou, north of Linying, Sun Zhenhua's troops, the enemy, were fiercely attacked by our army, and the fighting was extremely intense. Our side has completely occupied Qilitou. Sun's unit suffered heavy casualties and fled in panic. The enemy north of Linying is increasingly frightened. The enemy in the Weishi area had no action, but a unit of theirs, claiming to be a division, launched a fierce attack on our line at Longcheng Gaozhuang. We met them with machine guns and mortars, and the officers and soldiers were exceptionally brave. In less than three hours, the enemy was completely defeated. The remnants, numbering no more than a hundred, all fled north towards Zhuang Wang Ni Bridge. (3) He Chengjun recently sent a telegram to Liu Maoen, saying that his determination to serve the Central Government is laudable, and the Party and the country will rely on him in the future to an immeasurable extent. He also said that Wan Xuancai is cunning and fickle, and the people of Hunan and Hubei have suffered greatly. Since he has been detained by the Central Government, he should be punished according to the law. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Luohe Telegram: After Sun Chuanfang arrived in Zhengzhou, he claimed to be ill and returned to Tianjin. Qi Xieyuan was greatly dissatisfied with this and secretly moved his office to Zhangde. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Not Many Jin Troops in Northern Shandong <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>

<p>Jinan Aircraft Report: Fu Zuoyi reports that there are not many Jin troops between Dezhou and Pingyuan. They are moving more towards the Wuding area. The enemy troops west of Yucheng were repelled yesterday. Han Fuju took a special train to the front to inspect today. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Shi Bangfan, the captain of the Second Aviation Team of Jinan, flew in from Kaocheng today. Shi said that our army is currently besieging Kaocheng, where Shi Yousan's troops are. Reconnaissance reports that the Jin troops in northern Shandong are the 27th, 28th, and 29th divisions, with the division commanders being Ye Qijie, Bai Ruqing, and Huo Yuanbi, etc. Each division only has the strength of a brigade. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao: Han Fuju left Jinan early on the 28th by special train to the front to inspect the garrison. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Qingdao: Chen Chen, the Shandong Salt Transport Commissioner, arrived in Qingdao from Jinan on the 28th. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>The General Headquarters of the First Army Corps telegraphed to Beijing on the 27th, saying that on the 25th and 26th, Fu Zuoyi's troops attacked Luokou and Yucheng, etc. Our single brigade met them head-on, and the Rong brigade attacked the enemy's rear. The enemy fled in panic and were completely routed. In this battle, more than 500 enemy officers and soldiers were killed, many were captured, and a puppet regimental commander was killed. Today, Chief Secretary Li Shuchun and Chief of Staff Li Zongbi went to the front to inspect in separate ways. The enemy in northern Shandong will probably be completely eliminated soon.

<p>Planning to Demolish Airfields Before Leaving</p>
<p>Germans Feel Joy Tempered with a Blow</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 27th – At yesterday's meeting of the Paris Ambassadors' Conference, it was decided that before the French troops withdraw, all hangars, aircraft sheds, and factories at the airfields in the occupied Rhineland area will be destroyed. This action has dealt a major blow to the Germans' joy over the troop withdrawal. The Catholic newspaper "Deutsche Zeitung" stated that this decision by the French was the result of the military faction prevailing over the diplomatic faction, and it is likely to worsen Franco-German relations. If the Allied forces leave behind traces of arbitrary destruction, it will greatly diminish the positive psychological impact of the troop withdrawal. Other newspapers, regardless of their political leaning, have expressed similar views. Some have even suggested that this decision was not initiated by the military but by the French, who are jealous of the development of German civil aviation and want to suppress it. The Rhineland area has two large Zeppelin hangars that were built before the war and cost a considerable amount of money. Once destroyed, it is feared that there will be no funds to restore them to their original condition. The other flight landing facilities are also very complete, so the French do not want to leave them for German civil aviation to use.</p>

<p>Hungarian Archduke Professes Loyalty to the Crown Prince</p>
<p>The Crown Prince Ascends the Throne When the Regency is Abolished</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 27th – Archduke Albrecht of the Habsburg dynasty has been engaged in the struggle for the Hungarian throne for many years. Recently, he suddenly professed loyalty to Crown Prince Otto, which many found strange. According to a report from Prague, Czechoslovakia, the inside story is that the Archduke wants to marry the wife of a Hungarian industrialist. The woman will soon divorce her husband, so he is willing to give up the throne to gain the beauty. Crown Prince Otto will reach the age of majority on November 22nd this year. Since the Archduke has renounced his claim, the Crown Prince can naturally ascend the throne. It is also reported that the engagement of the Crown Prince to Princess Maria, the youngest daughter of the Italian King, has been arranged by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, the Papal Secretary of State Pacelli, and Hungarian Regent Horthy. The agreement may be announced on that day. At that time, the Hungarian Parliament will also pass a bill abolishing the temporary regency system and inviting the Crown Prince to ascend the throne of Hungary. Czech newspapers are quite alarmed by the change in the Hungarian head of state and are eagerly hoping that neighboring countries will react.</p>

<p>And Provide Special Education</p>
<p>Electrical News Agency, Leningrad, 27th – The Soviet Russian government recently established a so-called Children's University, which will open soon. The age range is from twelve to sixteen years old, based on elementary school education and providing special education in communist propaganda. Graduates will serve as teachers in various elementary schools, instilling communism in children. The Soviet Russian education authorities believe that educating young people is more effective than educating adults, so they established this plan. The Children's University curriculum includes the following: (1) Religious Opposition Warfare; (2) Industrialization Issues; (3) Collective Farm Issues.</p>

<h3 id="e50">He Jian Reports to Zhang Guiji's Troops Invading Hunan <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence – In the past, Hunan Province was severely disturbed by Communist bandits. The Wuhan Headquarters sent Luo's division to cooperate with the troops of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces to suppress them, and they were finally eliminated. Unexpectedly, the banditry had just subsided when the rebel troops of Hunan, Tang Shengming, and others, colluded with Zhang Guiji's troops and entered Hunan from Longhuguan via Xiuren, Lipu, and Pingle, disturbing Yongming, Daoxian, Ningyuan, Lingling, and other counties. Fourth Route Commander He Jian, in addition to withdrawing Liu's division and Chen's independent brigade from Guizhou to block and suppress them in separate directions, also telegraphed a report to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Wuhan Headquarters Director He, reporting everything. Commander-in-Chief Chiang then sent Hankou Mayor Liu Wendao to Hunan to meet with He Jian and give instructions. Liu went to Hunan with Wen Susong, a senior staff officer of the Headquarters, on the 21st and had very successful discussions with He Jian. He returned to Hankou on the 26th. Headquarters Director He Yingqin, considering that the Hunan troops fighting the Guizhou troops had made extraordinary efforts, specially sent Counselor Jia Botao to Hunan to comfort the troops and ordered him to be stationed in Hunan for a long time to discuss military affairs with He Jian. Jia has already left for Hunan on the express train on the afternoon of the 26th. (May 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Wan Xuancai's Conversation Upon Arrival in Xuzhou <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Account of Being Captured in Ningling</p>
<p>Yang Hongwei Also Escorted to Xuzhou at the Same Time</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence – After Wan Xuancai was detained by Liu Maoen, Liu sent Adjutant Shi Dehai from Suixian to Liuhe the day before yesterday. There was Yang Hongwei, a counselor from Sun Chu's department, who was captured by the Third Division in Guide and held at the Second Army Corps headquarters. Liu Zhi then sent a special service battalion deputy, Wei Zhipeng, to escort Wan and Yang. The two arrived in Xuzhou by car at 8:00 PM last night (25th) and were immediately escorted to the Second Army Corps headquarters garrison office. Garrison Director Shen Maosheng telegraphed Liu Zhi for instructions and sent Wan and Yang to the army prison, placing them in the guard room with shackles on their feet. Wan is very tall and burly, 38 years old, a native of Song County. He was wearing a blue cloth student uniform top, gray Western-style twill military pants, black thread socks, and black straight-grained呢 short boots with buckles. During the conversation, he was straightforward and somewhat unrefined, but his demeanor was natural. According to Wan, (When I was chairman in Henan, I really didn't have much power. All the provincial tax collection agencies were taken over by Lu Zhonglin's people. Later, Lu sent people to Kaifeng to set up a military surcharge, which was too much, so I prohibited its establishment. The provincial government also failed to organize from beginning to end, being nominal but without substance, so there was no need to organize it. At the end of last month, my father passed away due to illness. I asked Yan for leave, but he didn't approve it, so I telegraphed Yan and returned to my hometown to arrange the funeral. After burying my father, my mother also became ill and passed away, and a son also died. Because my work was not going smoothly and my family was experiencing multiple misfortunes, I was very discouraged. My father's funeral was held on the 12th of this month. I only returned east on the 15th. On the 17th, I arrived at Liuhe. The forward units had already been defeated, and news was not being communicated. On the 19th, I took a car with three followers to Ningling to meet with Commander Liu Maoen. I discussed military affairs and my resignation with Liu. About two or three miles after leaving, Liu ordered a division commander to chase after me and invite me back, and I was immediately detained. I sent someone to discuss with Liu the possibility of joining in surrendering to the central government, but Liu never met with me and sent someone to escort me to the Second Army Corps headquarters and then to Xuzhou. As for the fighting in Henan this time, the forward units had no possibility of fighting. When I was in Bian, I repeatedly received orders to set out, but because there were no provisions, I couldn't go. Each unit was scolding each other by telegram every day, so there was no intention to fight. My troops were under the command of Yan, and Feng was very wary of my troops because my troops had captured many weapons from Feng's troops in western Henan and southern Shaanxi last year. I remember that when I was in Luoyang, I sent the director of political training to Tongguan to meet Feng. Feng said to him, "Tell Wan that there are still Northwest Army people. It's okay to let him defend Luoyang, and if he doesn't let him defend Luoyang, I will remove the obstacles." After this, my troops also stopped contacting Feng. If the military defense arrangement this time has Feng's troops focusing on the Pinghan Railway and Jin's troops focusing on the Longhai Railway, then there are heavy defenses built by Luo Wang on the Longhai Railway, relying on the Yellow River for defense. If Luo Wang attacks Bian, it shouldn't be a problem. When I was coming east, the Jin troops in front, nominally five armies, were actually only the strength of five divisions, mostly changing divisions into armies, changing names. Sun Liangcheng's troops were in the rear, reinforcing and focusing on the south of the railway line, with Weishi and Chenliu as the areas where Sun's troops were concentrated. If the Jin troops are assembled at Lanfeng and Luo Wang, the Jin troops' combat has three weaknesses: First, there is a shortage of grain and forage, requisitioning it locally, disturbing the people, and still feeling the shortage; second, the railway lines are long, the response is not swift, and the command is not unified; third, with the historical relationship between Yan and Feng, I'm afraid they may not be able to cooperate to the end. I haven't met Yan and Feng for a long time, so I don't dare to make conjectures, but it can be predicted.) I heard that Wan is now preparing to submit a report to Chiang, willing to serve the central government by attacking the enemy in the former units in Henan to atone for his previous mistakes. Yang Hongwei, a counselor of Sun Chu, lives in the medical room, wearing a gray military uniform, also with a physique like Wan's and a sharper tongue. According to him, (He is from Dezhou, Shandong, a graduate of the sixth class of the Baoding Military Academy. After the Northern Expedition, he taught at the Wuchang Military Officer Branch School and then went to various armies and divisions in Anhui and Henan provinces as a staff member. In the campaign to attack Feng last year, because he had old ties with Sun Chu, he was appointed as a counselor. This March, he followed Sun from Shunde to Zhengzhou. When the war broke out, he followed Sun to Bian. When ordered to go to Guide to see Wan Diunzon, Guide could no longer be defended, so he returned west on a small car via a roundabout route. He was captured by the Third Division engineers midway and escorted to the Army Corps headquarters and then to Xuzhou.) Yang is quite skilled in literature and wrote books on rough-edged paper while en route to entertain himself. His writing is still clear and has a scholarly air. (26th)</p>

<h3 id="e52">Reasons for Increasing International Postage Rates <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Transportation's Document to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The international postage rates for letters and parcels will be increased by one-third starting July 1st, which has been submitted by the Ministry of Transportation to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. The original document from the Ministry of Transportation is as follows: (According to the Postal Administration, the international postage rates listed in the Sixth Class, Various Countries section of the postage rate list promulgated in Circular No. 70 originally stipulated that the postage for letters should be 25 centimes, equivalent to one dime in national currency, for each unit of weight of 20 grams. Other postage rates were specified according to the type of item. However, in recent years, the price of silver has gradually decreased, and the previous conversion rate has become noticeably different. Recently, the price of gold has risen repeatedly, and the silver exchange rate has fallen sharply. Every pound sterling is now worth fourteen or fifteen dollars in national currency, which means that every dollar is only equivalent to 0.724 French francs. Compared to the previous conversion rate of 2.50 French francs, the difference is considerable. Our country still collects international postage according to the original stipulated rates, resulting in a loss of 45%. Because the transportation fees that our country pays to the various member countries of the Universal Postal Union are all calculated according to the gold franc stipulated in the convention, the balance of income and expenditure has been reduced by 45%. The losses on international parcel postage are even greater. For example, the transportation fee to France for a parcel weighing less than one kilogram is 1.80 French francs. Based on the current calculation of one dollar equaling 0.724 French francs, it is necessary to pay 1.04 dollars, while the postage collected is only 0.72 dollars according to the original conversion rate, resulting in a difference of 0.32 dollars. The losses on parcels weighing less than five or ten kilograms and parcels sent to other countries are also considerable. In order to avoid continuing losses and to prevent further declines in the price of silver and to facilitate calculation, it is proposed to change the original conversion rate of one dollar equaling 2.50 French francs or ten dollars equaling one pound sterling to 1.50 dollars equaling 2.50 French francs or fifteen dollars equaling one pound sterling, in accordance with Article 30 of the International Postal Convention, to provide relief. If calculated according to this revised rate, one dollar in national currency is equal to 1.6666 French francs, which means that every French franc is equal to 0.60 dollars in national currency, and the postage for international letters with a weight of 20 grams should be changed from one dime to one and a half dimes. This revision of the conversion rate will also increase the collected international postage by 50%, and all international parcels will also be increased by 50%. Furthermore, after checking, the fee of one and a half dimes for international letters with a weight of 20 grams, equivalent to 25.86 centimes, is almost the same as the fee of 25 centimes charged by Japan, the United States, and Germany for each letter with a weight of 20 grams, and is even lower than that of countries such as England and France, so there is no conflict. In addition to the registration fee and express fee being increased last year and the parcels sent to the United States being handled according to the agreement without paying transportation fees to that country, the increase should be postponed. Furthermore, the postage rates for Japan, etc., in the Seventh Class and Hong Kong, etc., in the Eighth Class are specially stipulated and should be changed with the domestic rates and not be counted. Therefore, the reasons and related documents have been presented for your review and instructions.) Based on this, the Ministry has conducted a review and found that Article 29 of the Stockholm International Postal Convention states that the franc is recognized as the monetary standard in this Convention and various agreements, referring to the gold franc of one hundred centimes. Article 30 states that each member country of the Universal Postal Union should stipulate the postage rates in its current currency according to the most equal number of French francs in value. The original standard of our country's currency was the silver dollar. Before joining the Universal Postal Union, the conversion rate of the silver dollar was one silver dollar equal to 2.50 French francs (one French franc is one hundred centimes), or ten silver dollars equal to 25 French francs, which is also equal to one pound sterling. At that time, the postage rates for various international postal items were calculated according to this conversion rate, which is the most equal number of gold francs in value. Now, the price of gold has risen and the silver exchange rate has fallen, so it is necessary to revise the conversion rate in accordance with the International Postal Convention to make up for the losses. Furthermore, the commercial activities of foreigners in our country are becoming increasingly prosperous. After this revision, foreigners will bear about 95% of the increased fees, while the Chinese people will only bear about 5%. Therefore, this revision will not have any impact on the general public. The situation presented should be approved, and the attached table should be copied and presented to your esteemed Yuan for review and filing, and for instructions to be followed.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Explanation of the Assembly's Interpretation of the Trade Union Law (Continued) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(13) Regarding point thirteen, whether the trade union is absolutely prohibited from interfering with or obstructing the business of a member who has withdrawn from the union or been expelled, according to Article 20, the investigation of the Trade Union Law stipulates that trade unions must not interfere with or obstruct the work of workers, whether they have not joined the union or have joined and withdrawn, and this should be handled accordingly. (14) Regarding point fourteen, concerning remedial measures if the number of union members falls below the legal minimum due to employers inducing members to withdraw from the union, as stipulated in Article 21, the Trade Union Law stipulates that employers may not make withdrawal from the union a condition of employment. This restricts employer actions, and according to Article 1 of the Trade Union Law, the situation of the number of members falling below the legal minimum is unlikely to occur in reality. (15) Regarding point fifteen, that although a trade union member who has withdrawn from the union and continues to be an industrial or professional worker is not entitled to the protection of Section 4 of this law, should they be allowed to continue enjoying the general rights of workers obtained in mediation or arbitration under the name of the union in labor disputes before withdrawing, the investigation reveals that only Article 33 in Section 4 of the Trade Union Law concerns the protection of workers. Article 33 states that workers shall not be dismissed during the mediation or arbitration of labor disputes, and does not differentiate between union and non-union members; therefore, they should be treated equally, and those who have obtained the general rights of workers in mediation or arbitration should be allowed to continue enjoying them. (16) Regarding point sixteen, as stipulated in Article 38, trade unions may declare dissolution due to merger or separation, but Article 6 stipulates that only one trade union may be established for workers of the same profession or industry within the same region. It is therefore inappropriate to allow trade unions in the same industry to separate, or trade unions in different industries to merge. What does "merger" and "separation" refer to? The interpretation of merger and separation should be based on the provisions of Article 23 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Union Law. (17) Regarding point seventeen, if the competent authority deems it necessary for an established trade union to merge or separate, and the members of the relevant trade unions cannot agree, can it be enforced? The competent authority should have the power to enforce its decisions when it deems them necessary for the trade unions under its jurisdiction. (18) Regarding point eighteen, according to Article 6, only one trade union may be established for workers of the same profession or industry within the same region. Are there boundaries for what is meant by "same region"? According to Article 4, it seems that the province, city, and county are considered regions. A province contains multiple counties and ordinary cities and cannot be the unit of a trade union region. A city (special municipality and ordinary city) and a county may be interpreted as the same region. However, strictly speaking, it would be difficult in reality to have only one trade union for one industry within the city or county region. In mainland counties, regardless of how many villages and towns are included, even in the Shanghai Special Municipality, if the entire city is considered the same region, workers in each industry (industrial or professional) throughout the city can only form one trade union. For example, although there are city-wide cotton mill unions, city-wide silk mill unions, and city-wide cotton weaving mill unions, workers in each factory cannot establish individual unions, and the city cannot be divided into districts to establish district unions. Supervision would be difficult, and the organizational procedure of trade unions would lack a foundation. If there are already individual unions in various factories, should they all be dissolved and merged? What problems would arise from this implementation? The investigation reveals that the boundaries of this region should be determined by the competent authority in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Union Law, taking into account local circumstances and investigating customs and actual conditions. (19) Regarding point nineteen, according to Article 50, if a trade union council is punished, and there is more than one council member, should the punishment be carried out separately? If there is a violation of paragraph 1 of the same article, and there is no report or a false report regarding the matters in Article 51, and the penalty is enforced, but the trade union does not have the title of "council member" and its current staff only includes executive committee members and standing committee members, who should the aforementioned penalty apply to? When punishing trade union council members, the responsible council member should be punished separately. If there is no title of "council member," whoever performs the duties of a council member, regardless of the title, should be punished. (20) Regarding point twenty, if a trade union staff member or member violates the provisions of Articles 10, 13, 17, 18, 20, 22, and 23, and there are no penalty provisions, how should it be handled? If a trade union staff member or member violates the listed articles, the competent authority should handle it according to the severity of the circumstances, issuing a prohibition for minor violations or dissolving the union in accordance with Article 37 of the Trade Union Law for serious violations. Violations of Article 13 are not effective, and members can supervise violations of Article 18 themselves. (21) Regarding point twenty-one, trade unions established before the implementation of this law must have already had elected staff. If they are required to re-register according to the procedures of Article 5 within two months in accordance with the provisions of Article 51, should they be required to revert to the initial stage of launching and re-elect representatives to apply for registration, or should the original staff be responsible for applying for registration according to the procedures? The original staff should be responsible for applying for registration according to the procedures. The above is an explanation of the various points of doubt regarding the Trade Union Law presented by the Shanghai Special Municipality Government and forwarded by the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan stating that the issue of trade union regions is not only whether they should be divided within a city or county. It is necessary to clearly explain how to determine the region when the scope of an industry exceeds one county or one city, or one province or one special municipality, and which authority should approve it. Furthermore, Article 4 of the Trade Union Law stipulates that the competent supervisory authority of a trade union is the provincial, municipal, or county government where it is located. However, if the scope of an industry exceeds one province or one special municipality, which authority should be in charge of supervision? Furthermore, Article 51 of the Trade Union Law stipulates that trade unions established before the implementation of this law should re-register from the date of implementation, otherwise they will be subject to the penalties of Article 50 of the same law. However, since the implementation of the Trade Union Law, cases involving interpretations of doubts in various provinces and cities have been difficult to resolve in a timely manner, often exceeding the time limit stipulated in Article 51. Can an extension be granted? These three items are difficult for the Ministry to independently draft reasonable solutions, so they are submitted together with the list opened by the Shanghai Special Municipality Government regarding points 18, 19, 20, and 21 for special consultation with the Legislative Yuan for review. The investigation reveals that the competent authority should determine how to delineate the trade union region in accordance with the provisions of Article 7 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Union Law, taking into account the circumstances. As for whether an extension can be granted because cases involving interpretations of doubts in various provinces and cities have been difficult to resolve in a timely manner since the implementation of the Trade Union Law, often exceeding the time limit stipulated in Article 51, an application should be submitted to the National Government for consideration in accordance with the provisions of Article 24 of the Implementing Regulations of the Trade Union Law.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Anniversary of the Shandong Provincial Government's Move to Jinan <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the May Third Incident, Jinan was occupied by Japanese soldiers, and the Shandong Provincial Government was temporarily established in Tai'an. All facilities were makeshift. The provincial government did not begin to move from Tai'an to Jinan on May 25 until last year, when Jinan was recovered and the Japanese soldiers withdrew. Time has passed quickly, and the first anniversary has arrived in an instant. The provincial government specially held a commemorative meeting in the main auditorium of the government office at 9:00 a.m. today (the 26th). A colorful archway was erected at the entrance of the provincial government office, inscribed with the words "Anniversary of the Shandong Provincial Government's Move to Jinan." Party and national flags were hung crisscrossed. The government office was decorated with lanterns and colors, which was extremely lively. More than a thousand people from various agencies attended. Chairman Zhu Xi opened the meeting and saluted, followed by a memorial week. He Siyuan reported on party affairs, and Zhu Xi reported on politics and military affairs. Then, a commemorative ceremony was held for the provincial government's move to Jinan. Zhu Xi reported on the significance of the commemoration, stating briefly that today's commemorative meeting is to commemorate the Shandong Provincial Government's move from Tai'an to Jinan on this day last year. Looking back on the work of the past year, whether it can satisfy the hopes of the people, all construction has not reached the original plan, which is really regrettable. However, in this year, on the one hand, taxes have been reorganized, and on the other hand, construction has been actively undertaken. Special attention has been paid to the previous suffering of the people, and efforts have been made to reduce the burden on the people. This is a regret that can still be reassuring. The comrades of the provincial government are appointed by the central government, and they should strive to carry out their responsibilities. In the future, there will be comprehensive plans for civil administration, construction, education, agriculture, mining, and commerce, which will be announced soon. Next, representatives of the Provincial Rectification Committee, He Siyuan, and members of the Provincial Government, Chen Mingyu, spoke in succession. The meeting adjourned with slogans at 11:00 a.m. After the adjournment, the provincial government also performed various recreational activities and dramas and opened for sightseeing for one day. All agencies were closed today, and shops also hung flags to celebrate (May 26th).</p>
<h3 id="e55">Passage of Vietnamese Aircraft Team Through Guangdong <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The Vietnamese government of French Indochina has an established aviation team. Recently, the aircraft team, considering the close relationship between Guangdong Province and Vietnam in terms of business and economy, launched a tour of Guangdong. Three French aviators, divided into two-seater Breuleux biplanes, came to Guangdong. The Vietnamese government first consulted with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to notify the Central Aviation Administration and then instructed the Guangdong Aviation Office to inform them. After receiving the telegram, the Aviation Office dispatched several Guangdong aircraft teams to meet them in the air and guide the French aircraft. As expected, at 8:00 a.m. on the 21st, the group of three aircraft departed from Annam and flew towards Guangzhou. At 2:30 p.m., two aircraft safely landed at the Dashatou Airfield. In addition, one aircraft went missing in the Guangzhou Prefecture. Upon landing in Guangzhou, the two Vietnamese aircraft were received by the head of the Guangdong Aviation Office, the captain of the aircraft team, and others, and visited the Guangdong aviation agencies and repair shops. The French aviators were disheartened by the loss of one aircraft and hastily went to the French Consulate in Shamian to rest and report the circumstances of the missing aircraft. The French Consul formally notified the Guangdong administrative agencies to order a joint investigation. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the French Consul received a telegram from Macau stating that the missing Vietnamese aircraft had landed 80 kilometers from Macau. The aircraft was slightly damaged, but the two Frenchmen driving the aircraft were fortunately unharmed. They walked to Macau on the same day and took a boat to Guangzhou on the 24th. (It is reported that the Vietnamese aircraft fell from the sky at 3:00 p.m. on the 21st in Datouwan in Nanlang Township, Zhongshan County. Fortunately, the landing site was a paddy field with tall rice stalks, and the geology was cement, so the aircraft was only slightly damaged when it fell. Both French aviators were in the aircraft, one with a nose injury and the other safe and sound. The villagers who saw the crash reported it to the local police, who dispatched a team to protect the site and report it to the county government. The two French aviators believed that the site was not far from Macau and transportation was convenient, so they volunteered to take a boat from Macau to Guangzhou to meet with the aviator who had come with them before returning to Vietnam together.) After arriving in the province, the two men met their companions and celebrated with relief. Today (24th), they jointly performed aviation stunts in Guangzhou with the aviators and explained the contents of the Vietnamese aircraft to the aviation personnel here. In the evening, Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government hosted a banquet to welcome the French aviators and invited personnel from the Aviation Office to attend in order to strengthen diplomatic relations. It is reported that the Vietnamese aircraft are scheduled to fly back to Vietnam via Guangzhou Bay tomorrow (25th) (May 24th).</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Process of Financial Reorganization in Heilongjiang Province <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Related to the Safety and Stability of the Economy of Northern Manchuria</p>
<p>The Current and Past Finances of Heilongjiang Province</p>
<p>Heilongjiang Correspondence: In recent months, the value of banknotes issued in Heilongjiang has been declining, causing significant losses to farmers. Pang Zuoping, member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and Director of the Finance Department, believed that this matter was related to the local economy. If no measures were taken to maintain it, the harm to the people in the future would be unimaginable. Therefore, he proposed a relief plan at the 73rd meeting of the provincial government, which was passed. Because this case is related to the safety and stability of the economy of Northern Manchuria, the proposal and the report of the Director of the Finance Department are recorded below: Proposal 1: It is proposed that the price of silver is increasing daily and the price of money is falling, causing difficulties for officials and civilians. If we want to find a fundamental solution, there is no better way than thoroughly reorganizing the finances. The method of reorganizing the finances has been submitted to the financial conference, and the reasons why we dare not raise the legal price and the situation of deficits in the treasury have been submitted separately for discussion in order to seek relief. However, the recent surge in the price of silver is even worse, with each yuan rising by twenty or thirty strings in a single day. The people's hearts are shaken and there is a great momentum that cannot be stopped. Detailed observation of the situation in this province is not comparable to other places. Since there is no place for currency transactions, there are few merchants who are trying to profit. Although there are a few who buy and sell Jiang money, it should not be so suspicious that money tickets will continue to be issued. The Guangxin Company has a printing press dedicated to printing money tickets. The general merchants and people are suspicious of this, thinking that the machine-made money tickets are being produced in large quantities every day, and it is natural that the value will continue to decline. The crowd is panicked and wary. This kind of rumor is easy to breed bewilderment, so public sentiment is declining day by day, and the price of silver must be soaring. (2) Unclear about the truth of the finances. The province's finances have been in deficit for a long time. Whenever there are large amounts of money needed, the Guangxin Company has to borrow. This cannot be concealed. However, in the past two years, the finances have been reorganized and there has been a turnaround. The income and expenditure are offset, and there is a surplus. Not only are the daily military and political expenses paid at any time, but also the various expenses during last year's Russian riot were reluctantly dealt with, and no points were borrowed from the company. Outsiders cannot know the truth in this regard. They all say that the government's deficit is borrowed from the Guangxin Company, and that last year's defense of Russia used a lot of money. Where does the company's money come from? It is nothing more than issuing money tickets to meet the urgent need. This kind of argument is all unclear about the truth. How can we blame them? Although the above two reasons are not the root cause of the financial riots, they also have a great impact. Without faith, the country cannot stand. Finances should be made public. If we do not break this doubt and declare the truth, how can we show great faith and dispel the doubts of the people? It is proposed that the provincial government order the supervisor and the Guangxin Company to regularly convene the banking community and the commercial and agricultural associations to close the Guangxin Company's ticket printing machine to show their determination not to continue issuing money tickets, and to announce the financial situation of the past two years on the spot so that the merchants and people can know the truth and no longer suspect, which may be able to maintain the hearts of the people and save them from one or two. Is it appropriate to submit it to the conference for public resolution?</p>
<p>Proposal 2: It is proposed that the province's currency system has always been based on Jiang money. In the 10th year of the Republic of China, in order to provide relief to the finances, the Guangxin Company was approved to issue current silver dollar coupons to circulate alongside Jiang money. However, the amount of silver dollar notes issued was not large, and they could not be promoted throughout the province. The circulation in various counties and cities still relies on Jiang money. All county bureaus collect all taxes, except for Heilongjiang, Hulun, Anda, Yalu, Lubin, Hulun, Shiwei, Qigan, and Zhaodong, where the promotion of silver dollars does not cause problems. Although the revenue from other county bureaus has been changed to silver dollars, they actually collect Jiang money. Jiang money must be priced at a legal price as a basis for conversion to silver dollars. In the past, when the price of silver was stable, the legal price was slightly higher than the market price to avoid losses in the treasury. However, when the situation suddenly changed last winter, the price of silver gradually increased. At that time, the legal price was 290 strings, although it was lower than the market price, it showed that we dared not increase it lightly, fearing that it would shake the hearts of the people and make it more chaotic. When the situation was slightly calmer, the price of silver continued to rise. If the legal price is increased accordingly, the people's hearts will become more and more virtual, the price of money will fall more and more, and what will become of the financial future? I inspected the market situation and reported to the chairman that I would not increase the legal price in order to maintain the financial situation. After several months, the treasury suffered hidden losses, which was huge. This situation has been reported repeatedly. Now the price of silver has risen to more than 440 strings, exceeding the legal price by more than 150 strings, and the treasury loss has increased as a result. As of now, it is estimated that the loss has been about 2 million yuan. If the legal price was increased step by step at that time, there would be no such loss. How can we not? However, where will the people take the loss? It can be said that this sacrifice of the government is to cultivate the vitality of the people, or it can be said to reduce the burden on the people. However, this loss is tangible and easily detected. If the legal price was also increased at that time, the situation would be intertwined and continue until today. How high would the price of silver have risen? The burden on the merchants and people of the province would be extremely heavy, and the loss would be endless. The so-called people's power and commerce would not be exhausted and decline. The deeper the accumulated illness, the more difficult it is to reorganize. Not only is the gold broken and there is no way to clean up, but also the income from all taxes will inevitably be sharply reduced, and the treasury will be invisible</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>The loss may be more than this number. The weight and the gains and losses are weighed. It is difficult to avoid losses in the treasury. Now, Wangkui, Zhaozhou, and other counties have requested to increase the legal price because the legal price is too low and it is difficult to maintain local police studies. The investigation shows that the situation is true in that county, and the same is true in other counties. Although we dare not immediately discuss the increase, we should carefully plan a good method. In the long run, it is not a good strategy. The fundamental solution lies in reorganizing the finances. All the methods for reorganizing the finances have been submitted to the financial conference. I will not repeat them here. However, the financial problem needs time to be resolved. What should be done to remedy the current situation in order to achieve comprehensive planning? The matter is of great importance and should be submitted to the conference for discussion. Please make a public decision. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Anhui's Meeting on Cutting Li Tax and Special Tax <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Ministry of Finance has decided to implement the national cut of the Li tax and the addition of special taxes on October 10, and has ordered the commissioner's offices of finance in each province to organize special consumption tax committees to prepare everything. The Anhui commissioner's office organized the committee on the 22nd and followed the rules of the ministry to divide into four sections: general affairs, investigation, review, and compilation. The general affairs section is in charge of documents and other matters. The investigation section is in charge of the current value of various goods and local sales, local production for export, local production for export to foreign countries, foreign provinces for import, foreign provinces for transit, the types and quantities of goods imported from overseas, and the opinions of merchants and people in the province on the cutting of the Li tax. The review section is in charge of the taxation tax rate, the location of the bureaus, etc. The compilation section is in charge of statistical forecasting tables. In addition to the commissioners' offices designating a number of people, the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce and the Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce also nominated Yuan Doushu, Tao Yutang, She Ceqin, Li Dachu, Li Yuwen, and others to join. The first committee meeting was held at 2:00 p.m. today (26th). More than 20 people attended. Bao Geng, the second section chief of the special office, chaired the meeting. After discussion, it was agreed that the revenue from the Li tax in Anhui Province, including the seven items of unified tax on sugar, tea, hemp, minerals, silk, cocoons, fragrant wood, and eggs (annual levy of 600,000 yuan), totals 3.16 million yuan per year. If the Li tax is cut, the tax revenue from the 19 special consumption taxes (sugar, textiles, wool products, oil, tea, paper, tin foil, seafood, timber, porcelain, livestock, medicine, lacquer, fur, large minerals, cocoons, silk, soybeans, and cotton) will only be about 600,000 yuan. Moreover, the commerce of Anhui Province is dominated by rice. Since rice is not taxed, the tax will inevitably be sharply reduced. However, the Ministry of Finance still needs to allocate 1.6 million yuan to Anhui Province after the cutting of the Li tax. This shortage of 1 million yuan has been ordered to prepare a business tax. The business tax is borne by the sedentary merchants. In this autumn of declining commerce, if the burden on the sedentary merchants is increased, the local area may be affected. The majority of the provinces advocate the implementation of the inland consumption tax to compensate for the 1 million yuan. Therefore, the investigation and review sections of the committee are both important. The Provincial Chamber of Commerce and the General Chamber of Commerce plan to nominate members to participate in the special committee. The rules stipulate that meetings are held once a day. Now, because the General Chamber of Commerce and the Provincial Chamber of Commerce must hold meetings tomorrow to discuss and nominate members of the two sections, the meeting will be suspended for one day tomorrow (28th).</p>

The county heads of each county are natural members. Sun Gongming, the county head of Wuhu County, is the director. It will be announced on June 1. If there is a bandit alarm in one county, the neighboring counties should immediately assist in the suppression. Those who are far away should also find ways to respond. Violators will be jointly reported to the provincial government for strict punishment. The office, with the consent of the county heads, may dispatch police teams to command the suppression of bandits and set up relay posts in suitable locations in each county to communicate news. There will be a monthly assembly.</p>

<p>The provincial government previously issued a notice prohibiting the export of rice because of the rice shortage in the province, allowing it to circulate within the province. Now, because merchants in various counties are still smuggling in a muddled manner, the measures for the circulation of rice within the province have been re-specified. Only shoulder-carried, back-carried, cart-loaded, and camel-transported rice is allowed. The transportation by boat is not allowed without a passport from the provincial government or the governments of various counties. The notice was sent to various counties yesterday to follow.</p>

<p>Revoking the Ningbo Municipal Government: Regarding the case of the former application by the Executive Committee of Zhongyin County to the Provincial Executive Committee to the Provincial Government to revoke the Ningbo Municipal Government and merge it with the Yin County Government, the 109th Executive Committee meeting of the Provincial Executive Committee has passed the resolution and has forwarded a letter to the Provincial Government for consideration.</p>

It is reported that the largest number of personnel changes will be in the Engineering Department, with little change in other departments.</p>
<p>Summary of Bandit Robberies: The home of Wen Zhou Asan, who lives in the Deng Feng Family Cemetery Village outside the North Gate of Cicheng, was suddenly attacked by several bandits the other night. They smeared Zhu Hei on their staffs, held torches, and broke into the house, intending to rob. Asan slipped out the door, beat a gong, and alerted the neighborhood. When the neighbors gathered with weapons, the bandits fled in alarm. One of the bandits, wearing a tattered military uniform, walked slower and was injured in the back of his hand and leg by the villagers. He was captured and sent to the county government yesterday morning for legal processing. Also, the Fumi Rice Shop in Jingcheng Head, Sanxikou, Southern Township of Yuyao, was suddenly attacked by five bandits posing as customers around 11:00 PM the other night. The shop owner, Zhao Erzhen, opened the door and was shocked to see robbers. The bandits rushed in and ransacked the counter, finding only a dozen or so silver dollars, which did not satisfy them. They then cut Erzhen with a knife and forced him to lead them to his house. Erzhen, forced by the violence of the thugs, had no choice but to lead the bandits to the home of Huang Zitan, allowing them to search and rob until 2:00 AM yesterday morning, when they left with a whoop. Upon inspection afterward, four rings, two pairs of gold bracelets, dozens of pieces of clothing, and more than 150 yuan in cash were stolen.</p>
<p>China &amp; South Sea Bank to Establish a Ningbo Branch: The China &amp; South Sea Bank headquarters in Shanghai believes that Ningbo is one of the trading ports where various banks have branches.

It is reported that Yu Zuoting, the manager of Tianyi Zhuang, has been hired as the manager of the Ningbo branch. Mr. Yu is reportedly looking for a suitable location.</p>

<p>Dispute Over Converting Farmland into an Experimental Farm: After the Xiaoshan County Government reclaimed more than 50 mu of farmland outside the North Gate to convert it into an agricultural experimental farm, the local villagers strongly opposed it. Later, Wang Xiufu, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, intervened and resolved the issue by having the county government purchase the permanent tenancy rights for 30 yuan per mu. However, the farmers were dissatisfied with the county government's payment of half in cash and half in promissory notes. On the one hand, they continued to petition the provincial government, claiming that reclaiming the original tenancy rights would cut off their livelihood, and requesting the provincial government to order the county to stop the conversion.</p>
<p>Businesses Change to Three-Term Account Collection: Since switching to the Gregorian calendar, Xiaoshan businesses have changed the collection of accounts at the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, winter solstice, and year-end to three terms: the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December. The accounts of all businesses are scheduled to be collected at the end of May this time. In addition to distributing account statements to all customers, all outstanding accounts must be paid before June 1st.</p>
<p>The Second District Executive Committee Accuses the County Magistrate of Negligence: Shen Zhenfeng, a member of the Xiaoshan Eastern Township Party, accused County Magistrate Du of illegally arresting party members. He requested the Second District Executive Committee to promptly forward an accusation to the provincial party headquarters that County Magistrate Du Shihua was guilty of negligence and abuse of power by illegally detaining comrades working for the party.</p>
<p>Xinwan Township Requests Allocation of Affordable Rice: The Xinwan Township Farmers' Association, citing the poor land and poverty of the local people, requested the County Executive Committee to allocate 300 dan of affordable rice to the township to maintain the people's livelihood. The case has been forwarded by the committee to the Civil Food Committee for allocation. It is reported that a preliminary investigation of impoverished households will be conducted in accordance with procedures to ensure that no one is left out.</p>

<p>Tokyo, This Newspaper, 28th: Our country's volleyball team fought the Philippine team for the second time today, avenging their previous defeat with a score of two to zero. We won the first game 22-20 and the second game 21-15. After the victory, everyone in our country was ecstatic.</p>
<h3 id="e91">(1) First Game: Victory After Defeat <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>When the game started at 2:50 pm, Japan's Sakamoto Hirota served as the referee. The Philippines gave the ball, and Cheng Xibing from our team made a killing shot. Both sides were evenly matched. However, our side made no progress, and the Philippine team took advantage of the situation with strong attacks from the blockers and hitters on both wings. The score was initially 7-3 in favor of the Philippines. Then the two sides fought harder, with alternating wins and losses, and the ball skills displayed were excellent. Qiu Guangxie from our team was accurate and powerful in his killing shots and Xu Heng was so in his saves, and the score increased sharply. In addition, the other side lost the ball many times and was able to turn defeat into victory, and the score became 9-7 in our favor. But because the Philippine team's center, Sang Pite Luo, was tall and strong, our defense felt difficult to save the ball until we exchanged places for the 11-10. The Philippine team again had the upper hand.</p>
<p>After a short break, the two teams showed their spirits and fought harder. They each won and lost alternately, and they had drawn score four times. The excellent save and the power of the kill were really rare ball skills. And the quick kill shot from Qiu Guangxie of our team was especially outstanding, like an eagle falcone. After both sides scored 20 points, the game became critical. Our team finally won the first game with a wonderful serving, and also the transformation of the kill of Qiu Guangxie and the magic of Li Lianying's triangular push ball, our side got two points and won 22-20.</p>
<h3 id="e92">(II) Second Game, Bloody Battle Resulting in Victory <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The second game began with our team initially at a disadvantage, repeatedly losing points and allowing the Philippine side to establish a four-to-two lead. Subsequently, Chen Xibing and Xu Heng's smashes, along with Li Lianying's pushes, breached the enemy's connections, reversing the decline. Afterwards, both sides frequently missed shots, and smashes often went astray. After ten changes of ends, there was little progress. Then, the Philippine team, with Sampitro's height dominating the net, gained an advantage. Coupled with Salva's smashes, their score gradually increased. Our team also scored two points. Finally, Qiu Guangxie's fierce attacks led to an eleven-to-six lead. After switching courts, our team continued to press forward with extreme ferocity. The Philippine side desperately tried to save the ball, often resulting in going out of bounds or touching the net. Afterwards, their blocking gradually became accurate and swift, and their score increased accordingly, but they still failed to tie the game with a fifteen-to-fourteen score. After their player Mengxila touched the net, their vigor was greatly diminished. Our side, with Li Lianying's quick and agile smashes, repeatedly scored, creating an eighteen-to-fourteen lead. At this point, the Philippine side requested a timeout to reorganize their formation.</p>
<p>When they rallied and restarted the match, it had reached a stage of hand-to-hand combat. Both sides exhausted their strengths, fighting bravely, winning and losing alternately, indistinguishable in skill. The excellence of the players' skills drew thunderous applause from the audience. Our team's smashers were skilled, and their blockers also often lightly pushed the ball, often confusing the enemy's front row, leaving them at a loss. This was especially evident today, such as Qiu Guangxie's irresistible smashes, which earned many points. As the second game ended, our team secured another victory with a score of twenty-one to fifteen, achieving a two-to-zero complete victory. The players on both sides today were as follows:</p>

<p>The Sino-Japanese tennis finals were held today. Yesterday, both singles matches were lost to Japan. The success of this doubles match is entirely relied upon as a turning point for China to win the championship. They are sharpening their swords and preparing their horses, hoping to achieve victory and preserve their former glory. At the sound of the second bell, both sides began shooting amidst the cheers of the crowd. After fighting for two hours, the victory or defeat was determined. As a result, China suffered a second defeat with a score of one to three.</p>

<p>China (Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai) 1, 4, 9, 1, 6, 0, 4, 1, 4, 2, 4, 4.</p>
<p>Fourth Set: Japan (Yamagishi and Shimura) 3, 4, 1, 5, 4, 5, 2, 1, 1, 4, 0, 5, 4, 4. Yamagishi and Shimura win 8-6.</p>

<p>Easy as Pie: In the first set, the performances of both sides were excellent. The shooting, slicing, blocking, and drawing were extremely exciting. The Japanese were more skilled and repeatedly gained the upper hand, easily achieving victory.</p>
<p>Another Loss: In the second set, the Japanese coordination progressed unhindered. In the blink of an eye, they won three consecutive games. Qiu Feihai continuously shot at Shimura with unstoppable sharpness, immediately winning two games. The Japanese cooperation was calm and perfect, and they again defeated China with 6-2.</p>
<p>The Glory of the Past: Lin and Qiu displayed their skills in the third set, not diminishing their former glory, winning much praise from the audience. Qiu's blocking was intelligent and skillful. The Japanese worked hard to resist, tying the score at 5-5. However, Lin and Qiu ultimately added two games with effective cutting and won 7-5. The victory was nearly achieved. The competition in the fourth set was even fiercer than in the previous three sets. China had an equal chance of winning as Japan. After leading 6-5, China took the lead 3-1. Judging from the overall situation in the twelfth game, it seemed that China's victory was within grasp. However, the Japanese were calm in will and united in spirit, ultimately reversing the dangerous situation and winning 8-6. If Lin and Qiu had won, the outcome of the fifth set would have been extremely difficult to predict.</p>

<p>First Half: 30 to 15</p>
<p>Second Half: 13 to 33</p>
<p>First Win, Then Lose</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Tokyo Dispatch, 28th: The performance of the Chinese basketball team in this session was atrocious, and the entire army was annihilated. This is an unprecedented disgrace in the history of the Far Eastern Games' Sino-Philippine volleyball matches. After losing twice to Japan and once to the Philippines, there was still hope that tonight's final second match between China and the Philippines would have good results, so as to avoid the disgrace of complete defeat. However, the Philippines still won the final victory with a score of 48 to 43. The glimmer of hope was extinguished from here.</p>

<p>The game started at 7:45 PM. The first lineup for China was Tang Baokun, Chen Shengkui, Wang Yuzeng, Lu Zhongen, and Liu Jianchang. At the start, Liu missed a free throw and was countered by the Philippines' Feilao Man. Chen and Tang then made contributions, initially taking a 4-2 lead. At that time, both sides were too hasty and missed good opportunities. After four minutes, China and the Philippines each added two points. After another three minutes, China's momentum was strong, and Chen and Tang successively contributed, with China leading 10-4. The Filipinos, frustrated by their setbacks, inevitably panicked and declared a timeout to discuss strategies. Re-entering the battle, China's performance became even more brilliant, and their movements were exceptionally agile. Before long, they took a 15-4 lead. Although the Philippines was under pressure, they still worked hard. The Philippines' Xue Laopeng and Tang Baokun each scored a goal, making the score 17-6. The Philippines' Villa Nita replaced Rila to fight, and the military situation was slightly boosted. Xue Laopeng added two consecutive goals, one from a distance and one from close range. In the blink of an eye, the score gradually approached, becoming 17-11. China's Lu Zhongen withdrew and was replaced by Li Guochen. At the fourteenth minute, Chen scored a goal and was then replaced by Yao Enhan. China's spirit was a hundredfold, and both offense and defense were excellent. Soon, they led 24-13. In the last two minutes, China, with lively passing and accurate shooting, was astonishing. What was even more surprising was that the battle lines were not even formal teams. In the first half, on the Chinese stands, Prince Chichibu and Princess Asaka of the Japanese Imperial Family,</p>
<p>Thirty Philippines Fifteen. The score difference between the two teams was half.</p>

<p>Changing formations and fighting again, the Filipinos were very spirited, gaining eight points within three minutes. Lu Zhongen re-entered the game, and Liu Jianchang retired to rest. With the help of their teammates, Lu and Liu repeatedly breached the enemy's defenses. Before long, China took a 38-24 lead again. The Filipinos also changed their formations and tried to recover. The competition between the two sides was fierce, each refusing to give way. The Philippines gradually improved and fell behind 31-40, only nine points behind. China announced a timeout to temporarily slow down the enemy's momentum. However, the enemy's skills were superb, their internal surveillance was strict, and their forward attacks were sharp. The score gradually approached again, becoming 36-40. Since then, the Philippines' momentum has increased, and China's performance has become clumsy. Coming from behind, they defeated China again with a score of 48 to 43.</p>

<p>15 to 4, Excellent Hitting</p>
<p>This Newspaper's Tokyo Dispatch, 28th: A detailed account of China's second great victory over the Philippines in baseball is given below.</p>
<p>The second Sino-Philippine baseball game was held at 2:30 PM today. China defeated the Filipinos by a large margin of 15 to 4. China's hitting was excellent, scoring 15 hits and earning 15 points. The two Philippine pitchers were both overshadowed, and the team's defensive work was also more advanced than before. There were not many spectators, probably because the championship had already been won by the Japanese, and the interest inevitably diminished. The weather was clear on this day, but the field was slippery due to the rain yesterday.</p>
<p>In the first and third innings, China each scored one point. In the fourth inning, China added two more points with two hits. The Philippines also each scored one point in the fourth and fifth innings, making the score 4-2, with China leading. In the sixth inning, China's situation was excellent, with three bases fully occupied, and five runners successively returned to home base. In the seventh inning, each side scored two points. In the ninth inning, China had another excellent performance, scoring four points with two hits. In total, China scored 15 points and the Philippines scored 4 points.</p>

<p>This Newspaper's Tokyo Dispatch, 28th: Details the grand occasion of China's victory over Japan in a women's exhibition singles match.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese women's tennis match was held this morning. The Li sisters, since overcoming the strong Philippines, have become famous. The level of Japanese women's tennis is also well-regarded. Once the clash was scheduled, the number of spectators at the stadium was unexpected. The overseas Chinese in the Chinese cheering squad and spectators had special interest. Whenever the Li sisters defeated the enemy and pursued victory, the cheers from the audience almost broke through the clouds. After the fierce battle was over and the great success was achieved, the cheers from the crowd rose and fell for a long time. It was truly a grand event. In the three-set match, the Li sisters won the first set. The Japanese, Kobayashi and Asabuki, seized the second set. The Li sisters won the third set. As a result, the Li sisters won two to one. Observing the battle record of the day, the Li sisters were calm and quick in their movements. Asabuki and Kobayashi were lively in running and able to cope. The situation was tight, and the atmosphere was full of clouds. The first two sets were evenly divided, with no winner or loser. The fighting was more intense. Asabuki suddenly had cramps and had difficulty moving, but continued to fight fiercely as before. As a result, the Li sisters won, but were also exhausted.</p>

<p>Result: Zero to Two</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th: The Sino-Japanese women's volleyball exhibition started at 1:30 PM today. As a result, Japan won two to zero. The score of the first game was 21 to 3, and the score of the second game was 21 to 7. During the first game, the skills of our team's smashers were quite good, but because of the weakness of their wrists, the three points they scored were all obtained from the opponent's smashes going astray. At the beginning of the second game, Huang Shushen's tactics were very effective, creating a single game in which each side scored three points. Following this, with Wang Chunruo and Lu Huixian's serving, our team's score increased again. However, the Japanese women's generals' offensive was too fierce, not something that our country's gentle team members could resist, so they often remained at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>New Greenery of the Meiji Jingu Outer Garden</p>
<p>Athletes from Four Countries Gather in Unity</p>
<p>(Tokyo Communication) The 9th Far Eastern Games, a competition for dominance in water and land sports among East Asian nations and an opportunity to connect emotionally, opened on the 24th at the Meiji Jingu Outer Garden in Tokyo. On this day, the sky was clear, the wind was gentle, and the sun was warm. At noon, 1800 participating athletes and 450 staff members entered the stadium to applause, led by the military band of the Toyama School of the Army. The first team of athletes was the Republic of China, all in white uniforms with the national emblem on their chests. They were full of spirit and high spirits, and everyone who saw them paid attention. Next was the Philippines, followed by India, and finally Japan. They circled the stadium once. At this time, the entire stadium was quiet as if no one was there. After the national anthem was played, the Vice President, Japanese Minister of Education Tanaka, read the Imperial Edict of President Prince Chichibu. Next was the opening address by President Kishii Kiyoshi, the welcoming address by Prime Minister Hamaguchi, and the congratulatory address by Kano Jigoro, a member of the International Olympic Committee. My country's Chargé d'Affaires in Japan, Jiang Hongjie, read a congratulatory telegram from Minister Wang Zhengting. This was followed by the response from the representatives of each country. First was my country's representative, Dr. Zhang Boling, followed by the Philippines, and finally India. All hoped that this conference would develop and progress, and that they would help each other in this spirit. Finally, the athletes took an oath. My country's representative, Zhang Lingjia, held the national flag by athlete Li Guochen, and the sports association flag was held by athlete Lu Ming, and two female athletes led the way to the stage to swear in Mandarin, with clear pronunciation and loud voice that resonated in the clouds. Afterwards, the representatives of the Philippines, India, and Japan also took oaths in the same manner. The Secretary-General of the Games, Hirao Ryosan, then announced the start of the competition. First, the Games flag was raised, and at the same time, thousands of male and female secondary school students sang the Games song, and thousands of pigeons were released, and two aircraft from the Asahi Shimbun and Nichinichi Shimbun flew in the sky. It was truly a grand sight. In this grand scene, the staff and athletes left the stadium, and the solemn and brilliant opening ceremony came to an end.</p>
<h3 id="e117">First Basketball Game Between China and Japan <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Japan Defeats China 39 to 24</p>
<p>The Referee is Unfair, Heavily Penalizing Our Country</p>
<p>Tokyo Communication: At 7:30 PM on the 24th, the Chinese and Japanese basketball teams began their contact. In terms of technique, the Chinese side seemed to be slightly higher than Japan, so they thought they would have the power to win, but they were inevitably a little careless. Initially, they did not expect to lose 39 to 24. The Chinese team's poor performance greatly affected the basketball championship. It is a pity. However, the unfairness of the referee on that day was obvious to all. In the first three minutes of the game, the Chinese team was penalized seven times, which was unprecedented in basketball history. The spirit of our team members was greatly frustrated, but they were still able to endure it to the end and did not commit any irregular behavior. The spirit of sportsmanship was demonstrated. Whether one wins or loses is not worth discussing. The bias of the Japanese referee revealed their own weakness. The details of the competition are described below.</p>
<p>The Grand Occasion of the Stadium: The crowding of the stadium that night was unprecedented, with at least 15,000 people present. Those without tickets could not enter and stood outside the door listening for news. There were also nearly several thousand news reporters in the press box, which was even more crowded. More than a dozen photographers were constantly taking photos with magnesium lights, and the loud noise frequently hit the eardrums. The tension in the air could be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Cheerleading Squad: The cheerleading squad organized by Chinese students studying abroad and overseas Chinese all came to the venue that night, scattered in all directions, numbering no less than a thousand people. Every move of our team was greeted with thunderous cheers, and their patriotic enthusiasm was worthy of admiration. The cheerleading squad all held small national flags, and some wore red hats and white uniforms. "China, China, Long Live China" was the common slogan. At the leader's call, responses arose from all sides, which was extremely lively.</p>
<p>Five Goals in a Row: At the beginning of the battle, our side's momentum was strong, and the connection between Yao Enhan and Tang Baokun was extremely lively, making it difficult for the Japanese side to run and cope. However, the referee issued a penalty order within the first three minutes, penalizing us five times, and three of them were successful. They took the lead with 3 to 0. At that time, the audience was very dissatisfied and there was some commotion. Fortunately, our team members were calm and warned the crowd not to make noise and to watch the situation.</p>
<p>Yao and Tang Display Their Power: At this time, the little general Tang Baokun and the tumbling Yao Enhan displayed their great power, each scoring two goals, and won with 8 to 3. The military situation was greatly boosted. Unexpectedly, the order to take free throws came again, which made the brave generals dare not fight desperately, and the whole army retreated. This was the first reason for the defeat that night. In the first half, our team lost 12 to 15.</p>
<p>The Situation is Gone: After the lemon time, our team still used the original formation to fight. Japan, on the other hand, used Tanaka as the center and Ueda as the forward, and the military situation became more prosperous. In the second minute, Ueda continuously attacked from outside the center line and scored two goals. The record gap became wider. The center Liu Jianchang's jump balls were all seized by the Japanese. The little general Tang Shenkun's basket throwing also lost his usual accuracy. The internal gaps of Li Guochen and Wang Xiliang were also constantly exploited by the enemy. As a result, the morale of the army was disintegrating, and the situation was gone.</p>
<p>Change of Formation: After that, the Japanese team's score continued to increase, and the record between the two sides became further and further apart. Our team's coach, Dong Shouyi, hurriedly changed the formation, using Wang Yuzeng as the center, Wei Pengyun and Chen Shengkui as the forwards, and replacing Wang Xiliang with Lu Zhongen as the inside line. However, it was also of no avail. In the second half, our team lost 12 to 24 again. The total result was 39 to 24, and the Japanese team won.</p>

<p>Japan Wins Greatly, New Records Continue to be Discovered</p>
<p>Zhao Rugong's Long Jump is Sixth, Showing Progress</p>
<p>No One from China Participated in the 100-Meter Preliminary</p>
<p>(Tokyo Communication) The 9th Far Eastern Games officially opened on May 24th. On the first day of the athletics competition, Japan won all the events except for the high jump, defeating the athletes of the three countries, and their spirit was unmatched. The results of three years of hard training are now displayed. My country relies on a few students temporarily practicing for a few times, hoping to win by luck, which is absolutely impossible. In the athletics competition, there is a scoring board with the flag of the winning country hanging. Only the Japanese flag is flying, and our country's flag has not moved at all, suffering the ridicule and contempt of the Japanese. As a reporter, I feel unspeakable pain and deeply hope that the people of our country will realize this thoroughly, work hard and practice continuously, and meet again in four years. The details of the athletics competition on the first day are described in detail below, which may also serve as a wake-up call for us.</p>
<h3 id="e120">(I) Discus Throw Final <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The participants from our country are Lu Ming, Zhao Wenzao, and Zhang Lingjia. A solitary line is drawn for those above 30 meters, and a 30-meter sign is erected. Another solitary line is drawn for those above 35 meters, and another solitary line is drawn for those above 40 meters. The national flags of each country are inserted at the point where the athletes of each country throw. At that time, only the Japanese national flag was seen advancing one after another, and they were all above 35 meters. My country competed with the Philippines, and they were all around 30 meters. Finally, six people were selected: Japan's Saito Makoto, Kuroda Tamotsu, Okita Yoshio, and Kuniuchi Takeshi, and the Philippines' Bireya and Aiskreiter. The results were as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's Saito Makoto 40.15 meters</p>
<p>(2) Japan's Kuroda Tamotsu 39.58 meters</p>
<p>(3) Japan's Okita Yoshio 38.83 meters</p>
<p>(4) Japan's Kuniuchi Takeshi 38.39 meters</p>
<p>(5) Aiskreiter 33.46 meters</p>
<p>(6) Japan's Bireya 33.18 meters</p>
<p>After three more final decisions, Japan's Saito won first place with 40.27 meters, Kuroda Tamotsu was second with 39.68 meters, Okita was third with 39.01 meters, and Kuniuchi was fourth with 38.39 meters. The Far Eastern record was 38.70 meters, held by Okita Yoshi. The top three broke the Far Eastern record this time, which is truly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e121">(II) 1500-Meter Final <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The participant from our country in the 1500-meter final was Jiang Yunlong. In the first lap, the Philippines' Yakv and Gray were in first and second place, and Jiang Yunlong was third. In the third lap, the Philippines only took first place, and Jiang retired to fourth. The four members of the Japanese team had gradually chased up. By the third lap, the Filipinos had no remaining strength and were overtaken by the Japanese one after another. At that time, Jiang Yunlong had fallen to the end, about 20 meters behind. By the last lap, Japan had won the first, second, third, and fourth places. Jiang was about half a lap behind, but he was still able to finish the race, and his spirit was admirable. The third and fourth places in Japan were:</p>
<p>(1) Tsuda An'ichiro, with a time of 4 minutes 6 seconds</p>
<p>(2) Kitamoto Masamichi</p>
<p>(3) Nishiura Katsujiro</p>
<p>(4) Kakutani Yasuji</p>
<h3 id="e122">(III) The Long Jump Decisive Victory <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Far Eastern record of 4.78 seconds was held by Japan's Senda Shomon, but this time it was broken by Tsuda by about 1.8 seconds.</p>
<p>The Chinese participants in the long jump were Situ Guang, Wang Jihai, Zhao Rugong, and Hao Chunde. Zhao Rugong achieved the best result and was selected into the final six, who were:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's Nambu Chuhei: 7.59 meters</p>
<p>(2) Japan's Tomiyama Ichiro: 7.32 meters</p>
<p>(3) Japan's Oda Mikio: 7.31 meters</p>
<p>(4) Philippines' Boktokshin: 6.89 meters</p>
<p>(5) Japan's Oshima: 6.72 meters</p>
<p>(6) China's Zhao Rugong: 6.68 meters</p>
<p>After the final three jumps, Zhao Rugong's performance did not improve, so he was eliminated. The four winners were:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's Nambu Chuhei: 7.59 meters</p>
<p>(2) Japan's Oda Mikio: 7.42 meters</p>
<p>(3) Japan's Tomiyama Ichiro: 7.32 meters</p>
<p>(4) Philippines' Boktokshin: 6.89 meters</p>
<p>The Far Eastern record was 7.07 meters, held by Oda Mikio. This time, the top three all broke the record. Nambu's score was very close to the world record of 7.89 meters. The progress of the Japanese is astonishing, and China can only lag far behind.</p>
<h3 id="e123">(IV) The High Jump Decisive Victory <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Only one Chinese participant, Li Zhongsan, joined. The Japanese participants were Kimura Kazuo, Ono Misao, Murakami Masatake, and Utsuki Akira (four in total). The Filipino participants were Tolidoble, Reyes, and Alifo (three in total). All eight had considerable skill, and the competition was extremely fierce. When jumping to 1.80 meters, China's Li Zhongsan actually jumped over it in one attempt. At that time, all eight participants successively jumped over it. When the height was increased to 1.84 meters, the Filipino Reyes, the Japanese Murakami and Utsuki, and China's Li Zhongsan all failed after three attempts. Only the Japanese Kimura and Ono and the Filipino Alifo and Tolidoble remained. The height was then increased to 1.91 meters. The Filipino Tolidoble jumped over it in one attempt. The Japanese Kimura and Ono both needed two attempts to succeed. The height was then increased to 1.94 meters. Ono failed to clear it, but Kimura cleared it on the third attempt. It was then increased to 1.96 meters. The Filipino jumped over it in one attempt, and Kimura also cleared it on the third attempt. Afterward, it was increased to 1.98 meters. Kimura was exhausted and unable to jump. The championship was finally won by the Filipino Tolidoble. The Filipino then jumped again, achieving a score of exactly 2 meters. Kimura was second with 1.96 meters. Ono was third with 1.91 meters, and the Filipino Alifo was fourth with 1.84 meters. The Far Eastern record was 1.93 meters. This time, the top two both broke the record, and the first place's 2 meters was very close to the world record of 2.03 meters. The Chinese track and field coach, the American Mr. Smith, believed that this was an unprecedentedly good result in East Asia, and this was no exaggeration. China's Li Zhongsan was able to jump to 1.80 meters after only one month of training. It can be seen that China is not without talent, but it suffers from a lack of continuous practice.</p>
<h3 id="e124">(V) 100 Meters Preliminary <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>No Chinese participants. First Group: (1) Japan's Nambu Chuhei, (2) Philippines' Nepomuceno, (3) Philippines' Gandili, time: 10.9 seconds. Second Group: (1) Japan's Yoshioka Ryutoku, (2) Japan's Abu Tsurao, (3) Philippines' Isigoshi, time: 10.8 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e125">(VI) 110 Meters Hurdles Preliminary <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>China had Lin Shaozhou and Xiao Dinghua participating. Lin was in the first group, and Xiao was in the second group. The results differed too much, and neither was selected, but both were very hardworking. (The second group's results have already been seen in the telegram and will not be repeated.)</p>
<h3 id="e126">(VII) 200 Meters Preliminary <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>China's Zhou Ende participated in the first group, and Zhong Lianji participated in the second group. Zhong Lianji was in second place at the start, but then fell back midway. In the end, Zhong gritted his teeth and desperately chased, and was not far behind the Filipino Creak in third place. The first group's time was 22.5 seconds, and the second group's was 22.1 seconds. If China's Liu Changchun had participated, there would have been hope.</p>
<h3 id="e127">(VIII) 200 Meters Low Hurdles Preliminary <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>China's Cheng Jingguan and Liang Jingping participated. Cheng was in the first group, and Liang was in the second group. Liang's score was better and was quite close to the Filipino in third place.</p>
<h3 id="e128">(IX) 400 Meters Preliminary <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>China's Liu Changchun and Zhu Ruihong participated in the first group, and Wang Jianwu and Mai Guozhen participated in the second group. Liu Changchun had a false start twice at the start. On the third start, he did not dare to move and started slower. He tried desperately to catch up but was unable to make up the difference. As a result, he only got fourth place and was eliminated. Everyone was disappointed. However, Liu had a leg injury and had not been training in Shanghai. The enemy's scores were all around 50 seconds, and Nakajima's record in the second group was even 49.4 seconds. It is no wonder that he failed.</p>

<p>Middle Schools to Merge During Summer Vacation</p>
<p>Zhenjiang News: The Jiangsu Education Department plans to merge the Songjiang Provincial Boys' and Girls' Middle Schools during this year's summer vacation. The reasons are: (1) to save expenses; (2) to avoid dormitory disputes; (3) according to the principles for establishing senior high schools from the National Education Conference, a merger is necessary. Furthermore, because most of the female students are from Zhejiang Province, local people have criticized this, and the girls' school principal, Jiang Xuezhu, has often felt that it is difficult to handle matters. Also, because she is physically weak and often ill, she has long considered resigning. The boys' school principal, Chen Jing, was sent by the Education Department last winter to resolve the unrest. Because he is capable and handles matters effectively, he was appointed as principal. However, Chen had no intention of serving as principal and repeatedly requested to resign, but was not approved. He had to work hard to improve the school's affairs and actively reform it. Over the past half year, the results have been remarkable and deeply in line with public opinion. Now that there is a merger, Chen is considering using this opportunity to resign and return to the Education Department to fulfill his original intention. However, it is said that the authorities are extremely cautious when considering candidates for the principalship after the merger, striving to find someone who can adapt to the environment to satisfy the hopes of the local people.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Tomorrow is the May 30th Massacre Commemoration <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A Memorial Meeting Will Be Convened</p>
<p>A Public Memorial Ceremony Will Be Held</p>
<p>Regulations Stipulated by the Municipal Propaganda Department</p>
<p>The May 30th Massacre was a joint slaughter of the Chinese people by British and Japanese imperialism. Recognition of and efforts to commemorate the May 30th Massacre should include: (1) The May 30th Massacre originated from the oppression of Chinese workers by Japanese-owned factories in Shanghai in February of the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), which led to a strike. The Japanese used high-handed measures to shoot and kill the worker Gu Zhenghong, thus arousing conscious workers and patriotic students in China to participate in the Party's anti-imperialist movement. On May 30th, a grand anti-imperialist propaganda and demonstration was held in the Shanghai International Settlement. The British police chief, Englishman Everson, ordered the police to shoot and kill our patriotic unarmed civilians in a tragic scene. From May 30th to June 5th, eleven Chinese compatriots were tragically killed, eight were seriously injured, and more than a dozen were slightly injured. Subsequently, similar massacres occurred in Nanjing, Guangzhou, Jiujiang, Chongqing, and other places to support the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>(2) We can draw the following conclusions by summarizing the causes and facts of the May 30th Massacre and the subsequent massacres: (1) Imperialists are united in their opposition to the Chinese National Revolutionary Movement. (2) They are at least united on the basis of this common interest. (3) Imperialists have consistently used a policy of slaughter against the Chinese National Revolutionary Movement from May 30th to the present. This is what we must deeply recognize.</p>
<p>(3) May 30th was a commemoration of the National Revolutionary Movement led by the Party's Premier, which directly confronted the imperialists in a bloody battle. At that time, the imperialists, seeing the awakening of the Chinese nation, could not help but panic. They did not hesitate to violate justice and humanity by using a policy of slaughter to maintain the irrational and unequal treaty rights they had obtained. However, in fact, the Chinese National Revolutionary Movement only progressed further as a result of this. The Chinese people only became more conscious and gathered under the banner of the Party. In the shortest period of time, the Northern Expedition was completed, the imperialists' henchmen were eliminated, and the foundation of the imperialists' aggressive policies in China was shaken.</p>
<p>(4) Since May 30th, the progress of the National Revolutionary forces in overthrowing the warlords and shaking the foundations of imperialism has increasingly proved that the imperialists' use of warlords, or the collusion of warlords with imperialists, to sabotage the progress of the revolution is doomed to failure. The failure of the traitorous officials Feng Gui, Zhang Tang, and others who colluded with imperialists last year is even more obvious. Recently, the rebellious Yan Xishan has followed in the footsteps of Feng Gui, Zhang Tang, and others to endanger the progress of the revolution and shake the foundations of the Party and the country. His failure can be foreseen. However, before he is eliminated, we must uphold the spirit of the May 30th martyrs, support the Central Government, eliminate the rebellious Yan, and forever destroy the tools used by imperialists to invade China, both old and new warlords. We must strive to abolish unequal treaties and overthrow all imperialism to complete the mission of the National Revolution.</p>
<p>(5) May 30th is one scene of the tragic history of the Party leading the people to resist imperialism. Therefore, to commemorate May 30th, it must be held vigorously in the places designated by the Party. We must punish all counter-revolutionary elements and communists and reorganized factions who sell out the revolution in the name of the people. We must vow to fight heroically against imperialism under the principles of the Three People's Principles. Attached slogans: (1) May 30th is the commemoration day of the imperialists' slaughter of the Chinese people. (2) Slaughtering China is the imperialists' last struggle. (3) Use the power of the National Revolution to defeat all actions of the imperialists. (4) Continue the spirit of the May 30th martyrs. (5) Overthrow all imperialism and abolish unequal treaties. (6) Protect the interests of the revolution and eliminate the remnants of warlords, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. (7) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party. (8) Long live the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department of the Chinese Nationalist Party</p>
<p>The National Day of Humiliation for the Chinese people is also a revolutionary commemoration day for the Chinese people's direct resistance to the atrocities of imperialism under the oppression of the warlord government. As a result of the May 30th Massacre, the Chinese people suffered the tragedy of slaughter, but at the same time, it made the Chinese people more deeply aware that the warlords and imperialists are the sole enemies of the Chinese people. Now that the fifth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre has arrived, feudal warlords and all counter-revolutionary elements continue to attack the revolutionary rule. Recalling the martyrdom spirit of the May 30th martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country and struggled for the people, it is truly a tragic and moving event that inspires future generations to have endless feelings of excitement. We should expand propaganda and continue the revolutionary spirit of the May 30th martyrs and the national support for the May 30th Massacre to remove all obstacles to the revolution today, consolidate the foundation of the Party and the country, and comfort the souls of the martyrs underground. Yesterday, the Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department thoroughly formulated various measures, and the probes are recorded below.</p>

<p>Eighteenth Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee held its eighteenth standing committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Fan Zhengbo. The following is an excerpt of the agenda:</p>
<p>Discussion Items: (1) A proposal from the Sixth District Party Headquarters stating that the concession authorities of this city are planning to establish a labor-capital reconciliation department, requesting the city government to strictly negotiate for its cessation and to write to Chinese directors of the concession to resolutely oppose it. Resolution: Forwarded to the city government. (2) A proposal from the Second Direct Branch requesting the transfer of a message to the railway bureau to allow the No. 8 express train heading southbound to stop at Meilong Town to suit the needs and benefit the people. Resolution: Forwarded to the two railway administrations. (3) A proposal from the Civic Education Committee stating that the organizational rules of social groups in this city have been submitted for review and registration. Resolution: Approved for registration. (4) A proposal from Tong Hangbai and Chen Dezheng to submit twenty prospective party members for review. Upon investigation, Zhu Hezhong and Li Xiaosheng have a long revolutionary history with the party, and Central Committee members Hu Hanmin and Li Wenfan have provided proof of their service, requesting exemption from the prospective party member process, which may be approved. It should be submitted to the organization department, the district branch should add its seal and present it to the Central Committee for handling. Shen Jinsheng, Xu Yan, Zhu Peidan, Lin Mingyun, Shi Hao, Huang Que, Zhu Shihao, Tan Kesheng, Tang Wenhui, Wu Zuoqiu, and Fei Linzhen and eleven others have incomplete procedures, do not meet the standards, have corrupt behavior, or have little understanding of the party, and should not be approved. For those whose circumstances are less severe, the organization department should consider ordering them to complete the procedures for further review. Huang Ruilin, Huang Bingye, Chen Kehua, Nian Zu, Xu Jihe, Sun Yuqi and six others are not citizens of this city and do not meet the fourth standard for selection, so should their change be approved, and this matter should be reported to the Central Committee, submitted to the organization department, and requested instructions from the Central Committee. (5) A review report from comrades Wu Bokang and Fan Zhengbo regarding a city center district construction plan submitted for review. Upon inspection, the plan is generally acceptable, but there are no plans for the city party headquarters or the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall near the city government, which seems inappropriate. The city government should be consulted to have the city center district construction committee quickly add it to make it more complete. Should this be submitted for public resolution? Resolution: Approved with modifications according to the review opinions. (6) A proposal from the Civic Education Committee to investigate a case of encroachment on public land by the Yuyuan Garden branch of the City Temple, and requesting sanctions. The matter has been investigated and the report is consistent with the facts. The original documents and investigation report are attached for review and discussion. Resolution: Forwarded to the city government with the investigation report. (7) A proposal from the organization department for prospective party member forms. Two hundred and seventy-eight forms with complete procedures and six forms to be considered, totaling two hundred and eighty-four, are presented separately in a list for review. Resolution: Those with complete procedures are approved, and Chen Dezheng is appointed to review those to be considered.</p>
<p>Temporary Motions: (1) A proposal from a standing committee member stating that the Second District Party Headquarters is requesting the city government to instruct the Education Bureau to take over Shanghai Middle School in order to uphold the resolution and enforce the order. Resolution: Forwarded to the city government. (2) A proposal from a standing committee member stating that the Student Union is reporting the results, sincerely requesting that personnel be dispatched to count the equipment and allocate advance funds.

<h3 id="e145">Foreign Ships Docking at Anqing Wharf <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Has Requested Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Revoke</p>
<p>The Anhui Provincial Government decided to establish a public wharf in Anqing to attract foreign ships from Britain and Japan, causing great opposition from Shanghai shipping merchants. This matter was previously reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the origin of this case was a proposal from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inspector Li Fang, stating that foreign ships on the Yangtze River could not dock in Anhui, causing inconvenience for passengers and cargo. His report made it seem as if there were no Chinese ships operating in Anqing, disregarding the fact that Sanbei Merchants Steam Navigation Co. had ships and wharfs that could facilitate the loading and unloading of cargo and passengers. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs then consulted the Anhui Provincial Government, and the Anhui Provincial Department of Construction held an enlarged meeting, deciding to establish a public wharf to attract foreign ships to avoid foreign merchants establishing wharfs inland. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company reported this matter and strongly opposed it, stating that while the Anhui Provincial Government attracting foreign ships to dock at wharfs could avoid the suspicion of establishing wharfs inland, the drawbacks would allow foreign ships to compete for inland shipping business. It also cited the third clause of the Sino-British Yantai Treaty of the Guangxu period, which prohibits foreign merchants from operating ships in the interior (Datong and Anqing in Anhui, Hukou in Jiangxi, and Wuxue, Luxikou, and Shashi in Hubei and Hunan are all inland locations and not treaty ports. According to the regulations of the Yangtze River, foreign merchants should not be allowed to load and unload goods privately. The proposed solution is to allow ships to temporarily stop and load and unload passengers and goods using civilian boats). The original clause was requested to be forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prevent the situation. The bureau has now received a reply from the Ministry of Communications stating that it has been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to revoke the approval for foreign ships to dock. They will notify the Anhui Provincial Government again when they receive a reply.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Ministry of Communications to Establish Wireless Communications Network <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Settlement Method for Telegram Fees Also Drafted and Announced</p>
<p>Minister of Communications Wang Boqun stated that as China's news industry is developing rapidly, important communications in various places often suffer from the inability to be transmitted quickly. The reason for this is that there are many radio stations in various places, but the staff is small and insufficient to distribute the work, so they cannot immediately take photographs. After a long time, this violates the fundamental purpose of promoting the news industry. Therefore, a wireless communications network is established to ensure that messages are sent, received, and photographed as soon as they arrive, without delay. The method for settling telegram fees has also been drafted in four articles and communicated to all radio stations for compliance. The methods are as follows: (1) Wireless telegrams collected by wired telegraph offices should be sent to the radio station along with the telegram fees. (2) Telegrams received by radio stations and sent to places where no radio station is established should be sent to the local telegraph office along with the telegram fees. (3) If a telegraph office or radio station encounters obstacles due to lines, equipment, or weather and needs to transfer the telegram to another station for transmission, the telegram fee will be divided equally between the offices. (4) If a telegram received by a telegraph office or radio station cannot be sent for any reason and is transferred to the local radio station or telegraph office for transmission, the telegram fee should be handled in accordance with the collection method.</p>

<p>Financial Department Sends Shanghai County Finance Bureau Chief to Negotiate with City Government</p>
<p>The dispute over funds between the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has become a long-standing issue. In order to urgently resolve the matter, Hu Pu'an, member and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, proposed at the provincial government meeting (27th) the other day to send personnel to jointly calculate the disputed funds with the city government. The police expenses that the provincial government should allocate to the city government from the national tax revenue should be consulted with the Jiangsu Finance Special Commissioner for allocation according to the instructions of the national government. The public security expenses that the city government owes to the Shangbao and Liang counties should also be allocated according to the plan. The proposal was approved by the meeting and the Financial Department will send County Finance Bureau Chief Wang to negotiate with the city government. County Magistrate Yan of Shanghai County had returned to Shanghai the evening before because the negotiation had made some progress.</p>

<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation received a telegram from the Hangzhou National Goods Factory Federation stating that the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company, China Industrial Factory, and Meifeng Silk Brocade Bureau transported goods to Shaoxing to participate in the first Shaoxing National Goods Exhibition. The goods displayed in Shaoxing were confiscated by the Hangzhou Nanxing Bridge Cloth Donation Bureau. After repeated negotiations, they were unsuccessful. They telegraphed your federation for assistance on Xianri. The goods have not been released until now. It is easy to cause negative thoughts in relation to advocating national goods. In addition to sending telegrams for appeals, representatives Ruan Jihou and Chen Guohua were sent to your federation to report everything. Please give assistance quickly so that the future of national goods can be promoted.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau discovered that an advertisement was published in the newspaper on May 1st regarding the sale of rice essence to solve the problem of eating. Considering that this matter concerns the health of ordinary people, personnel were sent to the Bailing Drugstore on Six Malu, east of the Central Grand Theater, which sold rice essence, to purchase a sample bottle. It was claimed that when cooking rice, adding rice essence can save rice and firewood and does not produce a stiff, burnt, or sour smell, but it is palatable and nourishing, curing diseases and saving the poor. After inspecting the instructions on the sample, there were many doubts, so the original was sent to the Health Bureau for chemical testing. The Health Bureau tested the sample and found that the alum content (17.92%) was too high and failed to prove the special effects listed in the pamphlet. It is undoubtedly a deceptive way to make money. The bureau sent a letter to the Shanghai Special District Court yesterday requesting a ban.</p>

<p>Shanghai's rice supply depends entirely on domestic sources. Previously, due to strict inspections by water and land police, rice boats were waiting to see what would happen. Recently, some rice boats from Suzhou and Tongdeng passed through the border between Kunshan and Xinzheng, and were suddenly stopped for inspection by those claiming to be a merchant group. After repeated proofs, there were delays. Yesterday, the rice merchants decided at a meeting to send personnel to investigate in order to negotiate and notify the rice boats in various production areas to transport rice to Shanghai as usual in order to maintain the people's food supply. If they encounter inspections by merchant groups, they should ask them to state where the merchant group is from.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Huang Yihui Kidnapped <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Two Bodyguards, One Dead and One Wounded</p>
<p>Chauffeur Also Injured and Died</p>
<p>Huang Yizhu's son, Huang Yihui, a sugar merchant from Xiamen, serves as the deputy director of the Central China Bank. One day he was kidnapped. On the day before, at dusk, he was returning home from work in his car when he was chased by two cars carrying kidnappers. As they approached Huang's car, they stopped it. Huang's two bodyguards, seeing the matter, immediately fired their guns to defend their master. The bandits also returned fire. Due to the disparity in numbers, Huang Yihui was kidnapped. One of the bodyguards was killed and the other was injured. The chauffeur, injured in the abdomen, also died in the hospital. This newspaper learned the details that night, but did not publish them immediately for other reasons. Although Huang is a sugar tycoon, his situation is far from what it used to be due to the influence of the sugar industry. Huang Yihui personally only has a small amount of household expenses provided by his father, and his education is very strict. Therefore, the actual situation is not wealthy. Huang Yizhu is currently suffering from madness and resting at home.</p>
<p>Kidnapping Details: Huang Yihui is 34 years old and lives at 22 Baojian Road. At 6 PM the day before yesterday, after finishing his work, he took his own Stutz Bearcat automobile number 824, driven by the driver Yu Yongcai. Inside the car, in addition to Huang, were bodyguards Wu Xiying and Ma Ping'an, each carrying a pistol to protect the car. When they reached Haig Road, they noticed two cars following them. When they reached 346 Haig Road, a motorcycle suddenly overtook Huang's car from the left. The driver, Yu Yongcai, fearing a collision, slowed down to let it pass. At this time, the two cars behind had approached Huang's car and stopped abruptly. Four kidnappers jumped out, each holding a pistol, and opened the door to fire at the bandits, totaling five shots. Unfortunately, none of them hit. The bandits returned fire, hitting bodyguard Wu Xiying, who fell to the ground and died. Ma Ping'an was also injured and unable to resist. The chauffeur, Yu Yongcai, was injured in the waist and could not resist. At this time, Huang Yihui sat motionless in the car, his face pale, and was forced into the bandits' car, which sped away. The time was 6:20 PM. When the Jing'an Temple police heard the news, they ordered a large group of Chinese and foreign detectives to drive to the scene, but it was already 7:00 PM. The bandits had gone far and could not be pursued. In addition to finding bullet casings and broken glass on the ground, they sent Ma and Yu to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. Ma's injuries were light and he could be saved, but Yu's injuries were fatal and he died after Wu. The detectives carried the bodies of Wu and Yu to the forensic examination office on Fellen Road. The two sides exchanged fire no less than twenty times. One of the bandits was injured in the leg and carried onto the car by the bandits, who calmly escaped. It was also heard that the motorcycle had been following Huang Yihui for several weeks.</p>
<p>Forensic Examination by the Court: At 10:00 AM yesterday, Guo Huaipu, the prosecutor commissioned by the Special District Local Court, arrived at the site for forensic examination. He took the public seat and reported that he had gone to the scene to investigate after receiving the report, saying that he had found several bullet casings, which have been handed over to the firearms examination office for examination. Subsequently, Wu, the wife of the deceased Yu Yongcai, claimed that she was from Ningbo and currently lived at 162 Huanlong Road. My husband was tragically shot and killed, leaving behind three children and an elderly mother. The family is already poor, and the livelihood will be even more difficult in the future. She requested that the murderers be arrested and justice be served, and requested the bank to provide compensation. In addition, Guan, the wife of the deceased Wu Xiying, claimed that she was from Beijing, 29 years old, and had parents-in-law and children who depended on her husband for support. She requested that the murderers be arrested and punished, and requested the bank to provide compensation. Prosecutor Guo subsequently instructed Yu and Guan to take Yu Yongcai and Wu Xiying's bodies away for coffin burial, and ordered the Central China Bank to pay 400 yuan in compensation to each family. He also ordered the police to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>

In July of last year, the hen suddenly laid a strange egg, about one foot and three inches long and four inches in circumference, slightly larger than a normal goose egg. After the shop owner broke it open, there was an egg inside, the size of a normal hen's egg. For a time, it was rumored to be a great wonder in the neighborhood, and people came to see it. They all said that they had seen double-yolk eggs, but never an egg inside an egg, and they all praised it as a miracle. This strange news was published in this newspaper last year. Soon after the strange egg was laid, the hen was stolen, and a relative of the shop owner brought a black hen from Jiangbei and gave it to the shop to raise. Recently, within a week, it also laid a strange egg, which was even larger than the strange egg laid by the other hen last year, and the shell was also hard. After falling to the ground, it broke immediately, and the yolk and white were all there. The strangest thing was that there was another egg next to the yolk, also hard-shelled and the size of a normal hen's egg. The shop owner was indescribably happy that the hen had laid an egg inside an egg twice, and immediately put the strange egg in a bowl, treating it as a treasure for people to see. Therefore, the shop was often crowded with people watching. Unexpectedly, the hen laid another egg the morning before, with an even stranger shape, round and not long, different from the previous egg, with a circumference of about one foot, five or six inches, like a ball or a tangerine. The outer shell was also hard, and it broke immediately when it fell to the ground due to its weight. In addition to the yolk and white, there was also a hard-shelled small egg the size of a normal hen's egg inside. The shop owner immediately moved it to a bowl and did not cook it with the previous long egg. It is still in the shop. People who heard the news and came to see it were constant. Some superstitious people even said that the shop had laid three strange eggs in a row, which was a sign of wealth. Those who heard this laughed. However, those with deeper knowledge said that it is not surprising that hens lay eggs with double yolks, but it is rare for them to lay two eggs in a row. Now, with a large egg surrounding another egg at the same time, I don't know how the chicken's stomach is constructed. It is worth studying. However, it must have felt very distressed when laying it. The situation is recorded here for the reference of physiologists.</p>

<p>Currently Coordinating with the French Concession Police</p>
<p>The China Mail reports that busy cities often suffer from noise. Since the popularity of automobiles, the sound of horns has been constant, causing headaches. Therefore, calls to ban noise are often seen in newspapers. It is recently heard that the Public Concession Police are about to take action to ban unnecessary horn sounds when driving cars. They are currently trying to obtain the cooperation of the French Concession authorities. However, this issue is complicated and can only be carried out gradually. The first step is to notify Chinese and foreign car drivers of the proper way to use car horns and warn them that the law will be strictly enforced regarding unnecessary honking of horns. If there are violations of this law after receiving the notification, they will be prosecuted in court. It is heard that those who like to honk their horns the most are rental cars, followed by freight cars, and then some car owners who drive themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Comments of the City Film Inspection Committee on the Romantic Bandit Film <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>In the previous screening of the "Romantic Bandit" film at the Shanghai Grand Theater, there was a section where the Chinese servant appeared to be insulting to our country. Before the screening, the City Film Inspection Committee sent personnel to review the film and completely cut out the section. Unexpectedly, after the screening, Chen Anbang and others from Chengzhong Middle School sent a letter to the committee reporting that the film contained the section. The Film Inspection Committee believed that the theater should not have screened the section that had already been cut and should be punished accordingly. It also replied to Chen Anbang, who reported to the committee: "We have received your report that the 'Romantic Bandit' film screened at the Shanghai Grand Theater was inspected by committee members Chen Duanzhi, Yu Hongrun, Sun Yongyi, and Mi Jifang on May 13. According to committee member Chen Duanzhi's report, when inspecting the film, he found a section where the Chinese person took poison and ordered the theater to cut it out. At first, the theater staff member Mr. Huang strongly argued that there was no insult to the Chinese people. He was ordered to replay the original film for a detailed explanation. Mr. Huang had no objection and cut out the two sections of the Chinese person serving food and taking poison. There is a film inspection certificate for the day that can be used as evidence. As to whether the theater has two copies or secretly re-inserted the section after cutting it out and showing it stealthily, it is difficult to detect and inspect every day due to time constraints. According to this, since the person who reported the incident witnessed it on the spot, he can invite several people who were in the audience that day to testify and submit a formal document to the committee. The committee should give the theater appropriate punishment."</p>

<p>Around 8:00 PM the night before, a large number of sand boats were sailing through the waters of Sheshan Honggang, more than a hundred miles outside the Wusong estuary. Suddenly, twenty or thirty Ningbo boats swarmed in, filled with over two hundred pirates. They blocked the passage and boarded the sand boats, forcing them to sail forward with the pirate ships. The ships that were robbed included the Jin Yutai and Lu Yongmao from Liuhe, the Gao Changmao and Fu Changmao from Shijiusuo, the Jin Yuanlai and Gongdeshun from Shandong, and the Lu Yuanmao from Chongming, totaling seven large sand boats. The goods they were carrying were worth over ten thousand yuan. They were sailed to the vicinity of Lvsi Town, where the pirates released all the crew members, instructing them to go to Shanghai, prepare the ransom, and report the news. It was learned yesterday that the Gongdeshun and Jin Yuanlai, two of the robbed ships, were export sand boats and were not carrying goods, so their value was relatively low. The ship owners had already paid 2,800 yuan to redeem them. There has been no news about the remaining ships since they were robbed.</p>

<p>Wenhui Bao reports that a certain Chinese buyer in the hardware department of Mitsui &amp; Co. has been working there for over twenty years and has a good reputation in the business community. Last Saturday, it was suddenly reported that he had absconded. When the company discovered this, he had already been missing for several days. The company is currently hiring accountants to investigate the funds he collected privately but did not remit. It is rumored that the amount defrauded is over one million yuan.</p>
<p>Da Wan Bao reports that after the buyer of the hardware department of Mitsui &amp; Co. absconded, the four money shops related to him, with a total capital of over 2.2 million yuan, were affected and suffered excessive losses due to the soaring gold prices, facing internal and external pressures and also reportedly ran aground.

<p>Denying External Rumors</p>
<p>Wenhui Bao reports that yesterday, there were widespread rumors that the Fair Mercantile Company was about to close down. A Wenhui Bao representative specially visited the company this morning (the 28th) to inquire whether it would voluntarily liquidate in order to reorganize. Although there have been such discussions recently, a decision has not yet been made. The Fair Mercantile Company was established 80 years ago and specializes in textiles and groceries. It also has an insurance department and a real estate department. Its headquarters are in London and it is one of the well-known old firms in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Since being ordered to reorganize, the preparatory work for the Shanghai Special Municipality Chinese Cigarette Factory Trade Association has been completed. Yesterday, the official inaugural meeting was held at the Business Consolidation Association on Beihe Commercial Road, with over 50 people in attendance. The meeting began at 3:00 PM with formal ceremonies. Chairman Wu Tingsheng reported on the reorganization process, stating that although the Chinese cigarette industry has a 30-year history, it has never had a practical organization. Under the oppression of imperialism, it has been difficult to develop. Therefore, even with alliances, there has been little significant effect. Last year, Lao Jingxiu, Dai Gengxin, Hong Cangting, and others, recognizing this, proposed to gather most of the industry to unite and organize a trade association. During this process, they encountered many difficulties. Fortunately, all members of the industry felt that unity was necessary to resist foreign insults and resolve aggression. Therefore, they actively participated and supported, resulting in today's situation. Now, under the guidance of party and government organs and higher-level organizations, the inaugural meeting is being held today. The gathering of industry members demonstrates a spirit of struggle. He hoped that all comrades would continue to work tirelessly to solve various difficulties with their own strength and fight a decisive battle with foreign merchants, so that the dying Chinese tobacco industry could find a savior and not let down the enthusiasm of the three representatives who came to guide them. He personally felt particularly gratified. As for the association's charter, which was once adopted, it should be reread and amended because half a year has passed and it may be forgotten or inappropriate. Next, the general meeting charter was passed. The chairman read each article, and there were no objections. The chairman stated that the charter was approved internally. Compared with the industrial and commercial trade association charter issued by the Business Consolidation Association, there were shortcomings that needed to be amended by two representatives. Then, it would be submitted to the Business Consolidation Association for approval and implementation. All attending representatives approved, and Yao Jixian and Bao Gengsheng were elected to handle the matter. There were no other objections. Next, the executive committee was elected. The results were Wu Tingsheng, Lao Jingxiu, Shen Yankang, Hong Cangting, Bao Gengsheng, Dai Gengxin, Yu Banqin, Yao Jixian, Sun Xingde, Yao Weixiong, Wang Qiuchan, Zhang Xinliang, Jiang Lanting, Li Xuedong, and Jiang Pinyu, 15 people elected as executive committee members. Next, most of the alternates were Sun Lishan and Wang Yunfu. Next, the executive committee members were sworn into office. Next, Li Yongxiang, a representative of the Civil Training Association, gave a training speech, stating that all of you are leaders in the tobacco industry and probably know the meaning of organizing a trade association: one is for commercial interests, and the other is for the national economy and the people's livelihood. I also know the current painful and declining situation of cigarette factories. The first reason is that Chinese merchants lack the ability to compete due to the economic aggression of imperialism, and the remaining domestic rebels have not been pacified, and the government has not been able to wholeheartedly protect industry, which is also a pain point for Chinese merchants. There are many other reasons. The only solution now is to unite and assist the country to achieve freedom and equality internationally, and to effectively abolish all unequal treaties, which is how you can solve your own pain. At that time, there will be various good methods to make Chinese factories develop every day. The ultimate goal is to prevent foreign goods from being sold in China. This is the meaning of organizing a trade association. Then, the executive committee held its first executive committee meeting and elected Wu Tingsheng, Lao Jingxiu, Bao Gengsheng, Yao Jixian, and Shen Xingde as standing committee members. The meeting adjourned after 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e165">A Lawsuit for Breach of Marriage Arising from Tea Money <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Jin Renyuan, a 23-year-old from Baoshan, residing at No. 50, Sangyuan Street, outside the Dananmen, engaged Luo Runlian's daughter, Xiuying, of No. 591, Daji Road, outside the Ximen, on April 3rd of the 16th year of the Republic of China, through matchmakers Wang Genlin and Jin Abing. At that time, it was stated that the tea money would be 200 yuan and two sets of clothes. At the time of the engagement, 100 yuan in silver dollars was sent in advance, along with 6 yuan for fruit and a pair of gold rings, a gold hairpin, a gold-plated soft bracelet, and a gold-plated Ruyi hairpin (the gold hairpin was returned at the time because it was deemed too small, and the man's family was asked to exchange it). A date was chosen for the wedding this autumn, and the man's family notified the woman's family in advance. However, the woman's family stated that the remaining 100 yuan of tea money should also be sent as soon as possible in order to purchase all the dowry items. However, the man's family denied that the tea money was 200 yuan and filed a lawsuit with the local court, claiming that the fiancee's father, Luo Runlian, intended to breach the marriage and requesting that the marriage contract be upheld. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Qufei held a hearing. The plaintiff, Jin Renyuan, stated the previous situation and claimed that when the engagement was made, he had paid 106 yuan in tea money in full. Now, they suddenly claim that they still need 100 yuan in tea money and two sets of clothes, which he was really unable to afford. According to the matchmaker witnesses, Wang Chenshi (Wang Genlin's mother) and Jin Chenshi (Jin Abing's wife), the tea money was actually 200 yuan. It was stated that 100 yuan in silver dollars would be taken at the time of the engagement, and another 100 yuan would be taken at the time of the wedding. The jewelry was two gold pieces and two silver pieces. According to Luo Wangshi, 38 years old, from Nantong, Xiuying is my daughter. It was stated at the time that the tea money was 200 yuan and two sets of clothes. The judge obtained the statements and mediated the case in court, ordering the plaintiff to pay 80 yuan in tea money and two sets of clothes. The plaintiff replied that he had no money and could not agree. The judge said that these clothes are for your wife to wear, and even if you were asked to pay for three or four sets, you should do it. Moreover, the defendant's side does not object to the marriage. You should not rashly file a lawsuit. He repeatedly persuaded the plaintiff, but the plaintiff insisted that he had no money. Therefore, the mediation failed, and after a debate, it was considered concluded and set for judgment on the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>Resembling Kidnapping, Refusing to Release Her</p>
<p>What Was the Intention? Strict Handling by the Bureau</p>
<p>Chen Jinpei, a 37-year-old from Zhejiang, residing at No. 703, Huaji Road, Hongkou, has an adopted daughter named Yuexian, who is only 12 years old and very intelligent. Therefore, Chen loves her as the apple of his eye. At around 10:00 AM on the 25th of this month, Yuexian was playing at the door when she was suddenly abducted by Ni Asan, a rickshaw puller who had been fired, and hidden in Zhangjia Ancestral Hall in Qianhujiazai, west of Xujiahui. At lunchtime, Chen did not see Yuexian return home and knew that something was wrong. He searched around the neighborhood and learned that she had been taken away by Ni Asan, a rickshaw puller who had been fired. Yesterday, Chen found out where Ni was hiding and went to retrieve her, but Ni denied it outright. Later, they found her in the ancestral hall. Chen and his daughter went to the Second Sub-Station of the Sixth District to report. After receiving the report, Director Xu immediately dispatched a senior police officer to arrest Ni Asan and bring him back to the station. After Director Xu questioned him briefly</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>According to Chen Jinpei's statement, the defendant had previously been a rickshaw puller for a private residence, but his behavior was improper and he was fired. He dared to abduct his adopted daughter, and he did not know what his intention was. He requested a strict investigation. The defendant, Ni Asan, 32 years old, from Haimen, residing in Zhangjia Ancestral Hall, Qianhujiazai, firmly denied abducting Yuexian. Director Xu, considering that the case involved a rickshaw puller who had been fired and abducted the employer's daughter, immediately prepared a document to submit to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for strict handling according to the law.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Husband Contracts Syphilis, Wife Files for Divorce <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Huang Ayin, a young woman from Ningbo, had no one to rely on after her husband's death. In the spring of the 17th year of the Republic of China, she remarried Fu Jiufa, a fellow villager who worked on a ship, as his wife. However, after Ayin married into the family, Jiufa became lazy and was laid off. The daily expenses of the family depended entirely on Ayin's work. Last winter, Jiufa visited a prostitute outside and contracted syphilis, which was then transmitted to Ayin. As a result, quarrels arose frequently in the family. Now, Huang Ayin has hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a lawsuit for divorce in the local court, citing reasons such as failure to provide support and transmission of syphilis. After being ordered to summon them, the trial judge instructed both parties to go to the hospital to identify whether they had syphilis in order to make a decision. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Guo Shouyi held another hearing. Both parties complied with the summons and appeared in court. The defendant also hired lawyer Zhu Honglie to appear in court. The judge briefly questioned both parties and said to the defendant, Fu Jiufa, "Your syphilis is very deep, and a doctor has already identified it. Moreover, Huang Ayin's syphilis is also quite severe. However, was Ayin's syphilis transmitted by you?" He replied, "I have a hernia, not syphilis sores. Ayin's syphilis started this spring." At this point, the plaintiff said, "My sores were transmitted to me by him last November." The judge said, "Why didn't you report it at that time?" She replied, "I thought it would get better, but I didn't expect it to not heal even now." The judge then invited Prosecutor Li Gongchen to the court to express his opinion. The lawyers for both parties then made their statements. The plaintiff requested a divorce, while the defendant agreed to the divorce but wanted compensation for the wedding gifts, banquet expenses, and other losses, totaling 400 yuan. The judge then announced that the debate was concluded and the judgment would be announced later.</p>

<p>Zhao Aidi, a 19-year-old woman from Ningbo, firmly opposed her brother Zhao Laishun mistakenly listening to the matchmaker's nonsense and betrothing her to Lin Baoqing, who suffered from mental illness, was deaf, and had no legitimate occupation. Lin then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Special District Local Court, requesting a judgment that the marriage contract was valid. Zhao also hired a lawyer to countersue, requesting the dissolution of the unilateral marriage contract. After Judge Xu's investigation was concluded, he pronounced the judgment yesterday morning, rejecting Lin Baoqing's lawsuit and granting the dissolution of the marriage contract concluded by the two parties. Lin was responsible for the litigation costs.</p>

<p>The Blood Tears Stele and the Wife of a Rich Man</p>
<p>Never Sent to Nanchang</p>
<p>Accusing of Pursuing Funds and Compensating for Losses</p>
<p>Xiong Shiyi, the manager of the Baixing Grand Theater, which is located in the same place as the Jiande Association, was recently criminally prosecuted by Wang Hesheng, the representative of the Yuzhang Cinema, in the Special District Local Court for embezzlement and breach of trust due to a film rental dispute. According to the plaintiff's statement, the Yuzhang Cinema was established in Nanchang and specially hired Xiong as a representative stationed there. It signed a film rental contract with the Star Film Company and remitted a total of 1,800 yuan to Xiong. However, Xiong only sent 12 films, totaling 1,220 yuan in rental fees. In November of last year, Xiong rented two films, "The Blood Tears Stele" and "The Wife of a Rich Man," from Star, but never sent them to Nanchang. When Xiong was questioned, he initially claimed that they were detained by the Wuhu customs and then claimed that they were detained by the Zhenjiang customs. After the Yuzhang Cinema submitted a request to the Construction Department of the Jiangxi Provincial Government to inquire with the Zhenjiang customs, they replied that there was no detention. After further negotiations with Xiong, he evaded the issue, clearly embezzling the funds and engaging in fraudulent breach of trust, causing the Yuzhang Cinema to suffer huge losses amounting to 4,000 yuan. They requested a judgment ordering him to return the embezzled funds and compensate for the losses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi held a hearing. The defendant was absent and represented by lawyer Huang Yuping, who stated that Xiong Shiyi had gone to Nanjing to investigate the evidence and requested an adjournment. Wang Hesheng then stated the facts of the case. Judge Wu adjourned the hearing for seven days for further questioning.</p>

<p>Fired After Three Days of Helping</p>
<p>Inducing a Child to Go to Suzhou</p>
<p>Xu Chunlin, the owner of a hostel at No. 391, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, had a four-year-old daughter, Shibin, who was abducted by a former maid, Xu Gushi, on the 11th of this month and taken to Suzhou in an attempt to sell her. Because there were no patrons, she abandoned the girl on a small boat there. The boat owner then sent her to the Wuxian Public Security Bureau for temporary care. Now, the victim has learned of this and reported it to the French Concession Police, who sent detectives to arrest Gu Shi and bring her and the girl back to Shanghai for custody. The police yesterday sent her to the French Court to be investigated. The plaintiff first claimed that Gu Shi had been helping in the merchant's hostel for only three days and was dismissed because she did not work well. She held a grudge and took advantage of the merchant's lack of preparation on the afternoon of the 11th of this month to abduct the child. Now that she has been arrested, he requests that she be severely punished. When questioned, Gu Shi stated that she took the plaintiff's daughter out to play on that day because she was afraid of being scolded, so she took her to Suzhou and gave her to an old woman to send to the Public Security Bureau. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Gu Shi to three months in the women's prison to deter others. The child was handed over to the plaintiff to take away.</p>

<p>In the morning of the previous day, an unnamed man, about 40 years old, sought medical attention at the Tongyi Shantang at the Jiomudi entrance of the Minguo Road, Chinese Concession, due to illness. After obtaining a prescription, he went to the corner of Baoanfang on Dongxinqiao Street, Minguo Road, French Concession, diagonally opposite the Shantang, when he suddenly fell to the ground and died due to severe illness. A patrolling Western police officer saw this and reported it to the Great Bell Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The deceased was wearing a white foreign cloth short shirt, a black cloth cotton jacket, black cloth old cotton trousers, and a duckbill hat, barefoot and wearing shoes, looking like a recent down-on-his-luck person. His face was yellow and thin, indicating that he died of illness. A prescription was found on him with the surname Peng written on it, living in Deshanli. There was nothing else. The detectives went to Deshanli to investigate, but there were no family members. The detectives returned to report to the police chief, who then ordered the body to be carried into the Tongren Fuyuantang. As of yesterday, no family members had claimed it. Therefore, the police station ordered that the body be photographed and then issued coffin No. 9472 to be collected, transported to the Pudong cemetery, and buried.</p>

<p>Sued by the Cigarette Tax Bureau</p>
<p>Please Compensate for More Than Ten Thousand Silver Dollars in Taxes</p>
<p>The Qiping Tobacco Factory at No. 558, Wanxingfang, Xinji浜 Road, Hongkou, is equipped with a cigarette-making machine owned by Zheng Xiang and employs over 20 workers. It produces and sells cigarettes privately every day and never adheres to the stamping requirements. In January of this year, the Jiangsu Cigarette Tax Bureau discovered the tax evasion. Director Tang ordered investigators to cooperate with the Harbin Police Station to dispatch detectives to the Qiping Tobacco Factory, where they found two boxes of unstamped cigarettes, each containing 50,000 cigarettes. According to the stamp tax regulations, a fine of 30 times the amount should be imposed. If the fine is not paid, the cigarettes will be confiscated. Factory owner Zheng Xiang did not comply with the regulations and pay the fine. Therefore, the Bureau ordered that all the seized cigarettes be confiscated and sued Zheng in the Special District Local Court for tax evasion, which harmed national revenue and required compensation to prevent imitation. They requested that Zheng Xiang be summoned to court to be ordered to pay 17,550 silver dollars in taxes. The calculation method is based on the period from April of last year to the date of the discovery, a total of ten months, all of which were tax evasion periods. The minimum daily output of cigarettes was two boxes, each containing 50,000 cigarettes. The stamp tax for seventh-grade cigarettes should be 1,755 silver dollars per month, accumulating to the above amount in ten months. The court repeatedly issued summonses, but the defendant Zheng Xiang never appeared. The Qiping Tobacco Factory is now managed by a Japanese person. Yesterday morning, the court held another hearing. Because the defendant was absent, the presiding judge, Yang Yi, appointed a special agent for defense. The lawyer for the plaintiff, the Cigarette Tax Bureau, first stated the facts of the case, presented various evidence, and stated that the factory was indeed opened by Zheng Xiang. Although it is now managed by a Japanese person, this is a private transfer after the incident occurred. The plaintiff cannot recognize this and should request a judgment ordering compensation in full to emphasize national taxes. The lawyer for the defendant then made a defense. Judge Yang Yi announced that the judgment would be announced on the morning of the 31st of this month.</p>

<p>The woman, Ling Chenshi, hired lawyer Zhu Shuzhen to sue Ling Xushi, the original wife of her deceased husband Ling Zhenxiang, in the Local Court, requesting a division of the estate in six shares (the plaintiff Ling Chenshi's son Ling Yongquan gets two shares, and the defendant Ling Xushi and her three daughters get four shares). Each share is worth 700 taels, and the amount requested to be recovered is 1,400 taels. The defendant Ling Xushi also hired lawyer Zhang Enhu to file a defense, claiming that the son Yongquan was not born to the plaintiff but was brought in by the defendant for 30 silver dollars, raised by the defendant, and has been raised by the defendant. This time, on the 27th of last month, the plaintiff privately took Yongquan away as a bargaining chip, and that the plaintiff was not Zhenxiang's concubine but a mistress. The case had been heard in court, and the two parties were instructed to settle out of court. Yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Zhao Zhenhai held another hearing. The two parties stated the previous situation. The judge mediated in court and ordered the defendant Ling Xushi to give the plaintiff Ling Chenshi 900 silver dollars. The six-year-old boy Ling Yongquan should be returned by the plaintiff to the defendant for upbringing. Both parties expressed their willingness to settle the case and signed the agreement before leaving the court.</p>

<p>In front of the Shuntai South Goods Store at the Gongkuanfang entrance on Linping Road, Zhabei, Jiangbei native Shen Changlin was found injured by an axe in his right arm and lower back some days ago. His injuries were very serious. Patrol Chief Tian Guodong of the Fifth District, Third Sub-Station, transported him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment and inquired with the injured person. He claimed that he had demanded payment from Xu Xiaobao, the owner of the Xu Xingji wood shop at No. 53, Gongkuanfang, which led to a conflict. Xu ordered his associates to drag him to the alleyway and injure him with an axe. The station dispatched police officers to arrest the murderer, but Xu Xiaobao had already escaped with his wife, leaving only two children at home, one twelve years old and one nine years old. A photo of Xiaobao was found hanging on the wall and was taken back to the station and reported to the City Public Security Bureau for search and arrest.</p>

<p>Her Younger Sister Goes Missing, Her Mother Severely Reprimands Her</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at about two o'clock, a young woman of remarkable beauty, wearing a white and blue striped short shirt and trousers, with her hair done up, was seen pacing along Xinmin Road in Zhabei, looking overwhelmed with sorrow. A guard from the Eighth Precinct noticed her and, feeling surprised, went up to inquire. He learned that she was lost and did not know where she was going, so he took her to the Fourth District Headquarters. According to her statement, her name was Li Xiulin, from Ningbo, seventeen years old. Her father, Li Zucai, works for a shipping company. Her mother, Wu, passed away seven years ago. Her father remarried a woman named Gu, who became her stepmother. However, her stepmother treats her very harshly and sent her to the countryside. She recently came to Shanghai to do chores for her, treating her like a maid. The night before last, her stepmother ordered her to take her daughter, Xingxi, out for a stroll. Unexpectedly, Xingxi suddenly went missing. She immediately returned home to report it, but her stepmother said that if she could not find her daughter, she was not allowed to go home. She was extremely frightened and searched everywhere, but she had only been in Shanghai for five days and did not know the roads, so she lost her way and did not know where to go. When asked for her address, she only replied Xiangfu Lane, so there was no way to contact her family. She was sent to the Legal Department for further action.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Wu Dongsheng's Tragic Suicide by Hanging <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Wife and Lover</p>
<p>Adulterer Becomes the Undertaker</p>
<p>Wu Dongsheng, a native of Wuxi, was forty-five years old. He used to make a living farming in his hometown. His wife, Zhu, is currently forty-three years old and has two daughters and one son, all of whom have grown up. In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), Zhu, because she was idle and did not engage in proper business, became involved with Wang Jifa, a fellow villager. Not long after, she secretly fled with her two daughters and son to Shanghai, where she cohabitated with Wang at No. 41, Xihuaqin Fang, Bailinan Road, in western Shanghai. They opened a boarding house to make a living. The second daughter is already married to a Mr. Huang, and the son is also in school. Only the eldest daughter stays at home to help with household chores. The family is reunited and is quite well-off. Unexpectedly, Wu Dongsheng had been unemployed in his hometown for a long time and was struggling to make a living. At the beginning of March this year, he came to Shanghai directly to his wife's place and saw that his children had grown up and Wang and Zhu were living as husband and wife, like a magpie occupying a dove's nest. Unable to reverse the situation, he was extremely depressed. He was addicted to opium and needed six or seven small oceans a day. Although his wife provided him with a little every day, it was never enough to satisfy him, and she often complained. Wu tolerated it and temporarily stayed. Suddenly, at about 5:30 AM yesterday morning, Wu took advantage of everyone being asleep, untied his belt, and hanged himself. By the time the others realized it, he had already died. Officer Wei of the Third Police Station of the Sixth District learned of the incident and immediately led the police to investigate. He arrested the lover, Wang Jifa, the deceased's wife, Zhu, and the three children and took them to the Sixth District Police Station. District Chief Ren interrogated them separately. According to the lover, Wang Jifa, thirty-nine years old, from Wuxi, who runs a boarding house, has been involved with Zhu for ten years and has two daughters. Zhu stated that she was forty-three years old and that because her parents had no sons, they had recruited Wu Dongsheng as her husband. She got married when she was seventeen and had two daughters and one son. Later, Wu did not engage in proper business and had a difficult life, so she became involved with Wang and has been cohabitating with him for ten years. She also has two daughters with Wang. She came to Shanghai with Wang five years ago. After Wu came to Shanghai at the beginning of March, she still provided him with food and opium. She did not know that he would suddenly commit suicide. According to the eldest daughter, A Rong, nineteen years old, currently stays at home. The second daughter, Huang Wu, is eighteen years old and lives at Peichang Hardware Store on Beishansi Road. The son, Gen Da, is sixteen years old and is currently in school. After District Chief Ren took the statements, he immediately prepared a document and transferred them to the court for interrogation. He also ordered the local bailiff, Zhao Hefu, to report to the local court and request them to send someone for an autopsy. At 2:00 PM, the court appointed Prosecutor Yang Wenjun and Clerk Mao Zhenxin, along with an autopsy official, to come to the scene for an autopsy. They found that the deceased had indeed died by hanging and ordered the family to sign a guarantee to claim the body for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Du Shurui, a forty-three-year-old Ningbo native, lived at No. 271, Gaoshou Lane, Aierjin Road, in the Public Concession. He used to work as a clerk at Xianyi Sugar Store in Xiaodongmen. Last year, he suffered from stomach gas and medicine was ineffective, so he used opium to relieve the pain. Over time, he became addicted to opium. In March of this year, he was dismissed by his employer and is currently unemployed at home. Several years ago, he remarried Zhang, who is twenty-seven years old and works as a dressmaker. They only have one daughter named Gendi, who is fourteen years old. The family of three has a difficult life. His wife has repeatedly advised Du to quit opium, but Du is addicted to it like his life, so her good advice is met with resistance, and quarrels between the family are often heard. A few days ago, another quarrel broke out, and Du, feeling extremely frustrated, suddenly had a suicidal thought. In the evening, he secretly swallowed raw opium. At around 10:00 AM yesterday morning, his family discovered him and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, the rescue was ineffective, and he died in the hospital at around 1:00 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e184">Revised Regulations of the Directorate General of Posts <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Postal Workers' Unions</p>
<p>Raise Four Key Points</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Employees' Union sent a telegram to President Hu of the Legislative Yuan and the Legislative Committee regarding the change of the Postal Administration to the Postal Directorate General and the revision of the regulations, saying: (Titles omitted) "We recently read in the newspaper that the Postal Administration has been changed to the Postal Directorate General and that the revised regulations have been sent to your esteemed Yuan for review. We believe that the revision of the Directorate General's regulations is closely related to the colleagues of the unions and has a profound impact on the future of the postal service. However, because we are unable to know the details of the revision, we dare not rashly offer our suggestions. However, based on our limited views, there are several matters that are crucial and cannot be ignored. We are specially submitting them for your consideration and adoption: (1) The personnel system of the post office should be maintained. The postal service's personnel system, which requires examinations, is a fundamental measure for ensuring integrity. The appointments, promotions, and demotions are all regulated, allowing employees at all levels to serve with peace of mind, which is necessary to maintain. (2) The finances of the post office should be clearly separated from the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. According to accounting principles, each organization should have its own independent and complete accounting system, which should not be intertwined with each other. This will allow the financial increases and decreases of each organization to be clearly understood, and competition with each other will not be able to rely on the state-owned enterprise, which will allow for the hope of development. The clear separation of the finances of the two bureaus is urgent. (3) The postal economy should be absolutely transparent. The transparency of the economy has always been advocated by our party, because secret financial management can easily lead to corruption and confusion. In the postal service, postal workers do not understand the true economic situation, and all kinds of demands arise from this, which is also a source of disputes. Economic transparency can eliminate malpractice and cannot be ignored. (4) All post office staff, from the director general downwards, should be selected from within the bureau. The position of director general is extremely important and is related to the national postal facilities. If an outsider who does not understand postal affairs is appointed, there will be many obstacles. The regulations of the Postal Directorate General promulgated by the National Government when it established its capital in Nanjing originally had this provision, which shows that the policy is not easy to change and is pertinent. However, due to the private convenience of one or two people, they did not hesitate to request changes. Now, it is urgent to restore it to remedy the situation. All of these points are clearly limited in scope and may have already been stipulated in the regulations or will be revised by your esteemed Yuan, so there is no need for us to worry about them. However, because these matters are of great importance, we are submitting this document to your esteemed Yuan for your consideration and adoption. The future of the postal service depends on it. We are at your command. Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, Shanghai Postal Employees' Union."</p>
<h3 id="e185">Letter from the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union to the Capital's Petition Representatives <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Workers' Union sent a letter to the Capital's Petition Representatives, saying: "Respectfully to Mr. Chen Qiaqing, Wang Yansong, Wen Lanting, Ye Huijun, and Wang Xiaolai: We have learned from the newspapers that you have been entrusted with the important task of the Chamber of Commerce and have been elected as the petition representatives of the capital for our industry. You will soon go to Beijing to request the central government to withdraw its decision to resolve the disputes in our industry. We believe that you are well-known figures in Shanghai and have a reputation throughout the country. It is not something that you would do to be tempted and incited by the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, leading to the loss of your reputation. We dare not be presumptuous and respectfully state to you that the origin and end of the disputes in our industry are known to everyone, and the right and wrong are clear to public opinion. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association has run out of arguments and has repeatedly petitioned the central government three times, all of which have been rejected. It should not be difficult to submit to the order, but because of its heavy selfishness, it stubbornly resists and ignores the principles of law, humanity, and reason, forming the current stalemate. How should the central figures of society mediate in order to quell the storm? However, you are persuaded by the association to be willing to be pioneers, ignoring the orders of the central government, not speaking out for justice, only seeking unilateral benefits, and not hesitating to create a false impression, invisibly raising the emotions of class struggle. Regardless of the outcome of the petition, it goes without saying that you will be abandoned by the public and rejected by your compatriots. Wise and benevolent people will definitely not do this. Moreover, the central government's decision is impartial and fair, and it has sincere intentions. Our party is the leader representing the whole country. If it is as the association says, 'forced,' then the party will lose its purpose. This is also something that you would deny. Before you were appointed, our union deeply hoped that the representatives could uphold justice and transform their stubbornness. We did not expect that you would volunteer to go against justice. Now, reading the opinions expressed by the representatives in today's newspaper, it is truly shocking. Enlightened people like you should not be like this. Moreover, the representatives are either giants in the business world or famous figures of the time. They must be able to uphold the intentions of the party and sympathize with the suffering of the people, and conform to the will of the people. Therefore, our union does not avoid the risk of being punished and dares to offer frank advice. We will take the blame for our faults. If you are willing to accept our sincere words, we will be grateful. Respectfully wishing you good health."</p>

<p>The China Jishenghui previously learned that the famine in Xiba and other places in Huaiyin County, Jiangsu Province, was extremely severe. The Jishenghui and the Suzhou Relief Society jointly allocated 5,000 yuan, and the branch association raised 1,000 yuan on its own, totaling 6,000 yuan, which was remitted to the relief director, Zhou Yuan Kai, to distribute with his friends. This has already been reported in the newspapers. Now, the association has repeatedly received letters from Director Zhou stating that the laborers and the elderly and weak in Xiba cannot get enough to eat every day and cannot survive without relief. Yesterday, the association telegraphed Director Zhou to increase the relief by 2,000 yuan, which has already been cashed and remitted for use. It also informed him that only those who are extremely poor and helpless and cannot survive without relief should be given additional relief in order to ensure that the funds are not wasted and the results are practical, which is in line with the association's purpose of providing on-site disaster relief and saving lives. There are disasters everywhere in our country, and relief is unsustainable. How can people with the heart to help come forward to save the catastrophe in case it happens?</p>

The middle pages feature Mr. Hu Boxiang's paintings and Ambassador Wang Jingqi's farewell poems, which are exquisitely printed on copperplate paper and are extremely valuable. It is said that it has already been printed and will be published soon. The commemorative album is not for sale and it is said that you only need to pay 30 cents in postage to receive a copy. It is also reported that the group has now safely arrived in Qingjiang and will stay there for a while before heading to Lianshui, Xin'an Town, Dayishan, and Guanyun County to stay at Dengyuntai Mountain to sort out the work in Jiangsu.</p>

<p>Gu Heyi, the wine offering official of the painting academy, has passed away in Wuzhong. Heyi was the son of Fangbo of Zishan. Zishan managed a separate residence in Hulong Street called Yiyuan, and every pavilion, hall, studio, and house collected Song Dynasty poetry as couplets, which were exquisite and cleverly matched, and were passed down by word of mouth. Heyi relied on the legacy of his ancestors to devote himself to painting, and his landscape paintings were as famous as those of Lu Lianfu. The price was remarkably high. His sworn brother, Zhao Mianyun, once begged for a fan painting for forty gold and a small painting for a hundred gold, but the essence was condensed and refined, which was indeed different from ordinary works. There are many counterfeit works on the outside. Some people asked him to investigate, and Heyi laughed and thanked them, saying: There are many discerning eyes in the world, and the authenticity is naturally different. However, his own works are also difficult to avoid being crude. If the crude ones are attributed to counterfeit works, wouldn't that be okay? Heyi was not good at inscriptions, and the title of the painting often came from the hand of Mr. Someone from the Western seat. Mr. Someone was a famous and talented scholar who was known in Wuzhong. Heyi and Zhao Yunhe were good friends. Yunhe once showed Heyi one or two of his 100 books, and Heyi praised them greatly and wanted to ask for one. Yunhe promised to give him a refined work later. Unexpectedly, Heyi fell ill and never recovered. Yunhe heard the news and called out for shame. At that time, his liver yang disease broke out, and he rushed to Wuzhong to pay his respects and burn the paintings in front of the spirit to fulfill his previous agreement. Heyi loved peaches. Wu Ziding, a fellow traveler, asked him to paint the Bamboo Island Tears Picture for several years without success. Last summer, he specially asked a friend from Fenghua to buy a basket of giant peaches and brought them to him to urge him to complete it, but he repeatedly delayed it. The throwing of peaches to repay jade only became an empty wish. It turned out that Heyi's hands had been trembling in recent years, and this spring he suffered a stroke and his limbs were not working properly. It was not because he cherished his ink. Recently, Heyi has opened a separate residence in Zhujia Garden, where he died of illness. His sons and nephews are all from the same family and are famous for their paintings. His eldest son, Gongxiong, was my classmate at Caoqiao School and was very close to me. Heyi's name is Linshi, his style name is Xijin, and Heyi is his other name.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Record of Being Ordered to Transport Horses by Qiulang <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>My friend, Mr. Tang, works as a quartermaster in the 9th Division of the Hankou Army. We were happy to see each other, but Mr. Tang came here to receive horses and transport them to the front line to help in the war. Later, I visited him in the hotel, but I did not have the opportunity to express my feelings because he was in a hurry to leave, with no time to warm his seat. However, I also admire his courage to serve the public. There was also a medical officer Meng from the 6th Division in the same room. When asked, he was also ordered to receive horses, so they could help each other and things were more convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Yang Yixiao's Tale of Mount Rufeng's Milk Spring <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>A woman's two breasts are tall and protruding, hence the name Mount Rufeng (Breast Peak). Seventy miles southwest of the county seat, the central peak is like a lid, and the twelve ridges on the east and west sides arch towards the north of the city. There is a Baoshen Cave on the cliff that is ten feet deep. The spring flows like milk, sweet and drinkable. However, although human milk is sweet, people with damp and hot bodies have yellow breast milk. Cow's milk is hot in nature, and horse's milk is cold. If the spring flows like milk, the taste is sweet and the color is white, and it is neither cold nor hot. Men, women, old, and young can drink it at any time of the year. Regular drinking of the spring milk from Mount Rufeng can also strengthen the body.</p>
<p>In addition to Meng Jun contacting the authorities in the concession to arrange for staff to assist in the loading and unloading of horses at the wharf and the South Railway Station, Tang Jun also rushed to the Sixth District to ask the District Chief to recruit dozens of laborers to facilitate the management of feed and other matters along the way. He also hired service soldiers to go to the South City to purchase thousands of bags of wheat bran to feed the horses. It is necessary to load them immediately, drive the car through Beijing, and transfer them to the front line for use. According to Mr. Tang, the division has been victorious in all battles since its departure, and the vanguard has already passed Lanfeng, etc. He also said that Jiang Dingwen, the commander of the 9th Division and the commander-in-chief of the right wing, is brave and loyal and has repeatedly made meritorious service. He is especially able to share weal and woe with his subordinates, so the officers and soldiers all respect him. I think that when the horses are sent to the front line, they will further strengthen the morale of the army, and the famous generals and good steeds will soon be able to report victory.</p>
<h3 id="e195">A Record of the Acrobatic Skills of the Huiluo Circus by Cheng Zhizheng <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Last April, the Harmsdun Circus came to Shanghai and showed its acrobatic skills to entertain us. Its great and novel performances still left a great impression on the people of Shanghai. The Huiluo Circus has come to Shanghai again, and the performance site is also located at the original site on Route Bayard. As a result, as soon as it was publicized, it attracted the attention of many people. Yesterday was the first performance of the group. I went to watch the afternoon show with my friend and briefly recorded the special features that Harmsdun did not have for the readers.</p>
<p>Female Strongman The first performer was a trapeze artist, whose mind-boggling movements were as unique as those of the Harmsdun group. The difference was that the performer in this group was a woman. The woman's body was extremely strong and the abundance of her muscles was amazing. When performing, she inverted her body and tossed a child to the other side, with agile techniques. The audience was amazed and applauded a lot.</p>
<p>Bicycle on a Tightrope Walking on a tightrope is not surprising, but riding a bicycle on a tightrope has never been seen before. The performer that day was a young girl with a dark face, produced in Africa. Her technique can be called unsurpassed. Some say that the wheels of the bicycle are specially made with a concave shape, but it is not easy.</p>
<p>Living Under the Knife Then, a huge wooden board came out, with a girl standing with her back to it. Another girl threw sharp knives at the board. All the knives stood upright next to the child's body, with no room for a hair. If it deviated slightly, it would be unimaginable. Later, with the handle of the knife tied with a torch, she still threw it as before. The fire was raging near the girl's body, which made people dare not watch. This kind of acrobatics is rare.</p>
<p>The Humor of Dwarfs There was a dwarf in the group with a height of only two feet. He was dressed in a formal suit and had an imposing manner. He performed various humorous programs, and the audience laughed. There was also a bird caller whose sound was exactly like a bird and was full of emotion. The performance was better than that of the Harmsdun group.</p>
<p>Taming of the Four Elephants Then, four elephants were brought out to walk around the ring. Then, each of them was made to sit on a chair, raise their front feet high, stand upright, and cry. Then, they climbed on each other to make various different performances. The elephants were extremely tame, so no giant ropes were added when they performed. When the two tigers came out, they were each tied with iron chains to prevent them from changing. In addition to the elephants and tigers, there was also a zebra, which I had never seen before in my life. The capital is great. After browsing around, I felt that the capital was really not comparable to ordinary entertainers. Even in terms of tents, it is already a great deal. In addition, the feeding of livestock and the salaries of the members of the group are not small. What is especially valuable is that the group also has a motor and a generator, each used to supply electricity. The power is imaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Concerning Two Matters of "High-Interest Loans" <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>Recently, I heard about two matters concerning "high-interest loans." The first is quite amusing. Years ago, a certain Westerner residing in Nanyang opened a shoe store there. Due to a shortage of funds and difficulties in managing finances, compounded by being unfamiliar with the local people and unable to obtain loans, he reluctantly borrowed "high-interest loans" from Indians to alleviate his financial distress. At that time, the interest on "high-interest loans" was extremely high, with a rate of one-tenth of the principal per month. Even if the loan was not a full month, it was still counted as a month. If the loan was not repaid on time, the Indians would not hesitate to visit his store daily to demand repayment, some even bringing bedding and staying there until they got their money.</p>
<p>However, this Westerner borrowed money from dozens of Indian lenders, often failing to repay on time, yet he did not encounter any trouble with collections. Instead, the Indians trusted him and continued to lend him money. The reason was that the façade of his shoe store was impressively grand, with boxes of shoes piled up like mountains, giving the impression of substantial wealth. When the Indians came to collect their debts, the Westerner would point to the mountain of shoe boxes and say, "The goods have not been sold yet; I will pay you as soon as they are sold."</p>
<p>The Indians, seeing him as trustworthy, did not press for repayment. The Westerner, realizing the potential to deceive, borrowed more and more from the Indians, who did not refuse him despite the outstanding debts. Using this tactic, he fooled the Indians for a year. However, he knew that prolonged borrowing without repayment was not a sustainable strategy. Repaying the loans, including principal and interest, would amount to a staggering sum. Ultimately, he decided to abscond, stopping new shipments of goods. He sold off the remaining shoes in the store for cash, accumulated the funds, and left only empty shoe boxes stacked at the entrance, still giving the impression of a thriving business when the Indians came to inspect. The shoe store was on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>The Westerner announced that he needed to return to his home country for a trip, entrusting the affairs of the store to a partner, and then left with his accumulated savings of over thirty thousand gold coins. Upon arriving home, he sent a letter to the partner, stating that he would not return and had no interest in the store's affairs. The partner reported the matter to the authorities and declared bankruptcy. Only then did the Indians awaken from their great dream, but it was all in vain. This story is widely known among those residing in Nanyang. The Westerner is truly contemptible, while the Indians are both pitiable and laughable.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there was a carpenter whose income could not cover his expenses, and he often borrowed "high-interest loans" from an Indian to make ends meet. Later, the carpenter fell ill and was bedridden for five months. Without any income, his family's living expenses and medical bills were covered by further loans from the Indian, amounting to over two hundred gold coins. The carpenter was known to be poor and without any assets. The Indian continued to lend him money, not because he was sympathetic to his plight, but because he was interested in his daughter.</p>
<p>The carpenter's daughter, despite being from a humble background, was a beautiful young woman in her late teens. The Indian had long desired her and was willing to do anything to have her. One day, he directly approached the carpenter and said, "You owe me a considerable amount of money. Seeing your situation, I doubt you can repay me. How about you give me your daughter in marriage?" The carpenter was shocked to hear this. He owed a huge debt that he could not repay, and exchanging his daughter for money seemed like a viable option. He reluctantly agreed. He returned home and told his wife and daughter, and they all wept but were willing to comply.</p>
<p>A few days later, the Indian used gold to "buy" the beautiful woman and take her away. Soon after, the beautiful woman became haggard and lost her radiance. Within half a year, she passed away, like a fragrant flower fading. Alas, how tragic!</p>
<h3 id="e197">Discussing Chen Furu of Fuzhou, an Expert in Gold and Stone Inscriptions <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Chen Furu, a renowned expert in gold and stone inscriptions, will open his second exhibition of works at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association on the 25th of this month. On display will be more than one hundred items, including fan ribs and seals, and rubbings will be distributed to guests. I, being fond of carving, was delighted to hear this and eagerly went to view the exhibit. Here are my observations for fellow enthusiasts:</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's given name is Furu, and his courtesy name is Qigang. He comes from a scholarly family in Pinghu. In his early years, he followed Mr. Huang Ainong of Changle in serving as an official in Fujian province. He has a deep love for gold and stone inscriptions, diligently and painstakingly dedicating himself to this art. The attainment of any skill requires time and effort. As the saying goes, "Achieving enlightenment depends on the individual."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen's seal carving possesses natural charm, regardless of the Zhejiang or Anhui styles. Mr. Jiang Cun called him "a man of all talents," and this is no exaggeration. His bamboo carving is also excellent in both calligraphy and painting, with superb knife techniques, avoiding ambiguity and combining strength and simplicity. I once saw a statue of an ancient Buddha he carved, with the inscription by Layman Zhong Xuan: "Paying homage to the Buddha of the Western Paradise, the ice pool is thoroughly clear." It was exquisite.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen then asked me, as a native of Jiaxing, about Jiaxing bamboo carving. Jiaxing bamboo carving has declined drastically in recent years, and most of the practitioners are unskilled amateurs with no real talent. I recalled that when I was a child, after copying Li Si's Yishan Stele, I saw carvers in the market carving the characters upwards, not following the brushstrokes of the seal script. I said, "Jiaxing bamboo carving will be ruined by these people." This is evident in this example. Recently, only the works of Shi Wenxiu and Zhang Wenyu are still worth seeing. Mr. Chen nodded in agreement.</p>

<p>Episode Eleven: The Beautiful Woman Returns to the Man of Worth, The Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family</p>
<p>Liu Xing Shu: Does Zhenhui know this? I'm telling you, this is a rare thing to encounter. Can the details of the situation be known?</p>
<p>Zuo Shi Chen: At least a friend told me that one day someone was hosting a dinner at a Western restaurant and everyone wanted to call for a "tang chang" [a public sing-song girl]. So I called for Ruiyun. After Ruiyun left, that friend told me, "Don't you know? Ruiyun is getting married!" I said, "Really?" He said, "I don't know if it will succeed, but they are in negotiations." By "negotiations," frankly speaking, they are discussing the price.</p>
<p>I asked, "Who is it?" He said, "It's someone named Zhao. I know him a little. He's very young, not even thirty yet, and very wealthy. He even has a garden." That person is not a vulgar man; he's dashing and romantic. I said, "That's good, I congratulate Ruiyun."</p>
<p>Liu Xing Shu: So, did you ask Ruiyun later, or did Ruiyun tell you?</p>
<p>Zuo Shi Chen: Don't be impatient, let me finish. Two days later, another friend invited me to a fancy dinner. This friend is also known to you, Yi Yunshang, who runs Zhu Feng's. That day was the last time the family was hosting guests. Aside from this, they don't invite friends to private dinners. You know your Zhu Feng's. Zhu Feng's room is right across from Ruiyun's house. When they got to Zhu Feng's, they called out, "(Add tea)" and the little girl from Ruiyun's side added a cup of tea.</p>
<p>I asked her, "Where's your Miss?" She said, "She's out singing "tang chang." I said, "Where's the madam?" She said, "She didn't come out today because she's sick in the small room." So, I didn't go over there. After Zhu Feng and the young ladies went out, he said to me, "Second Young Master, do you really like Ruiyun?" I said, "It's not that I like her or not. After getting familiar, I don't have to call for a "tang chang" that I don't know. When calling "tang chang", there is no need for so much talk to coax or not coax her, and don't need to get cold. If need to be get cold, why should call her?"</p>
<p>Zhu Feng said with a smile, "Everyone says you, Second Young Master, really like her, so there's no need to deny it." But Zhu Feng didn't finish. I said, "It's just what? The next thing is she's getting married, right?" Zhu Feng said, "Do you already know?" I said, "I even know who she's marrying, isn't it someone named Zhao, Zhao Qishao?" Zhu Feng said, "You're wrong, it's not someone named Zhao, but someone named Wu. I didn't know recently, because a friend named Wu also works with us, so they often come to my room to discuss this matter, and I've heard it all."</p>
<p>I said, "My news is also very accurate. So where did the person she's marrying come from?" Originally, I didn't want to ask Ruiyun, because I really wanted to ask her the truth about the Zhao-Wu issue.</p>

In the afternoon market, the difference was only slightly more than 2 taels, with no drastic changes and the turmoil somewhat easing.</p>
<p>As for the trend in foreign exchange, it was firm, and banks made some purchases. The atmosphere was favorable as the "big bar" market did not move in the morning. Therefore, the opening was high.

<p>The Securities Exchange is temporarily closed today due to the settlement of the May futures of treasury bonds, and the market trading is suspended for one day. As for the market conditions of various treasury bonds yesterday, the futures with the July term have begun to be traded. The market is extremely deserted. Among them, there has been no market for the seven-year financial bonds.

<h3 id="e205">Cotton Yarn Spot Market Turning Active Amidst Weakness <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>Forward market suddenly rises by over 1 tael... Third-grade yarn also trends upward... The yarn market trends upward, and the situation is quite strong. The market changes quickly. After a long period of decline, a batch of transactions has emerged. The inventory in the market is relatively scarce, which is fundamentally stronger. A part of people's minds turned to selling in the past, and there are also quite a few who are hedging, so the table feels more tense. Whenever there is good news, the ups and downs are seen immediately. However, most people still expect a decline because the financial community is in turmoil. If long-term prices rise again, shorting will be done. In view of the general trend, there is a temporary possibility of standing firm, but the recent decline in third-grade yarn has been too severe. Manufacturers have proposed reducing working hours and limiting production, so the upward momentum is fierce.</p>
<p>Scattered investors cover shorts and rebound. Before the exchange's public auction, the opening market showed a weaker trend than the previous day, and people's minds were still level. Near-month contracts fell by 1 or 2 qian, while far-month contracts rose by 2 or 3 qian. In the 2nd and 3rd markets, raw cotton rose, and third-grade yarn trended upward. Many scattered investors covered shorts. All months rose by 1, 4, 6, 7, and 8 qian. In the afternoon, cotton rose sharply, and spot sales were still good. The situation was still exciting. All months rose by 2, 9, and 8 qian to 1 tael and 1 qian. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 22,850 bales. The closing price of the public auction is recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Japanese merchants receive spot prices, and Hanbang buys.</p>
<p>The cotton market is soaring, and the situation is very tight. However, the US cotton situation is still weak. However, people's minds in this port are very firm because the bottom goods in various markets are scarce. The Han market has been harassed by communists, and the combined price is high. Therefore, Hanbang buys when prices fall. Moreover, the actions of the Japanese company Dongmian Yanghang are very peculiar. For delivery in May, the market of more than 20,000 dan was suppressed by it. Now, in the afternoon, it is massively searching for 3-4,000 pieces of spot cotton in the market, and the final decision has not yet been made. Therefore, people's minds have been aroused by it. Scattered shorts are panic-stricken and are eager to cover, so prices are rising.</p>
<p>The opening of the Han standard six liang exchange indicates that the market is tight. The buying sentiment is increasing, and each rises by 2 qian to 1 qian and a half. In the afternoon, it was heard that Dongmian was absorbing spot cotton in the market, and the market suddenly tightened significantly. Each month rose by 3 qian and a half. The total transaction statistics for the whole day are 36,000 dan. The closing price of the Han standard is recorded on the left:</p>

<p>Declining Exports, Plummeting Market Prices</p>
<p>Capital Reduction and Reduced Labor Seem Essential Strategies</p>
<p>Workers Prepare to Strike in Protest</p>
<p>Osaka, 27th - A dispatch from Japan reports that Japanese textile mills are currently employing short-time work systems in an effort to reduce cotton yarn production and maintain market prices. It is widely expected that in addition to the existing 17% reduction rate, cotton yarn production will be further reduced by 10% starting July 1st. Current cotton yarn production is 227,000 bales per month, and current yarn prices have reached their lowest point since 1916. This is due to numerous factors unfavorable to the industry, including a sudden decrease in textile exports. While cotton yarn inventories are not excessively large, cotton cloth inventories are rapidly increasing. Active wage cuts or large-scale layoffs of factory workers are likely unavoidable in the near future. Therefore, labor union leaders are preparing to fight this situation through strike action.</p>
<p>According to reports, Japanese Third Grade yarn prices have fallen rapidly in recent months, reaching a low of 139 yuan, the lowest since 1916. Since the government's decision to abolish night work on July 1, 1929, factories increased the number of spindles to avoid a reduction in production. As a result, cotton yarn production increased to over 260,000 bales per month, setting a new record. The establishment of the Hamaguchi Cabinet and the implementation of tight monetary policies following the lifting of the gold embargo dealt a significant blow to the financial sector. This hindered domestic sales of cotton yarn and negatively impacted overseas exports. Industry operators advocated for reduced working hours to decrease production. However, China, the primary market for Japanese yarn and cloth, experienced reduced sales due to competition from local Japanese factories. In India, a unanimous decision was made in April to increase cotton goods tariffs from 11% to 15%, with an additional 5% levy on British goods within three years. The Japanese cotton industry was shocked and, despite various attempts, failed to reverse the situation, leading to further difficulties in both domestic and foreign trade. Factories were forced to resort to capital reduction and workforce reduction measures. The large-scale strike at Kanebo, a leading company, was triggered by wage reductions. This illustrates the distress of the Japanese textile industry. The aforementioned telegram suggests a rather bleak outlook for the Japanese textile industry.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Stabilized Grain Market in the Lower River Regions <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in Zhabei, the supply of inland rice was slightly strong, but sales were sluggish. The price of northern round-grained rice remained stable, while fresh white round-grained rice merchants attempted to raise prices, but buyers showed little interest, hindering their efforts. Consequently, the price of round-grained rice remained stagnant. A small amount of thin rice arrived and was well-received in the market, leading to stable prices. There was still a shortage of Yangjian rice, and top-quality rice saw some inquiries, resulting in a firming of the market. Sales of glutinous rice were unremarkable, and as inventory gradually increased, prices remained flat. Daily transactions in each stall were only half a cent. Around the 10th, boats arrived from the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in Shanghai and southern Jiangsu, and market sales varied. Early in the morning, Changshu machine-milled rice opened very strong, with sellers uniformly raising prices, but due to weak sales, prices stabilized again. Retail sales of Baotong machine-milled rice were not active, and prices remained flat throughout. Sales of southern thin rice and early rice were still active, and prices remained stable. There was a slight arrival of Yangdujian rice, but customer demand was weak, and retail sales were also very sluggish. Glutinous rice sales were sufficient, and the overall market was similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Imported Rice Continues to Rise by One Dime <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the imported rice market, buyers from various Yangtze River regions showed strong interest, and prices gradually rose by about two dimes. In the afternoon, sellers became cautious due to sales of road cargo, and prices fell back slightly by one dime. Overall, prices rose by about one dime compared to the previous market. Transactions included 2,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice at 15.82 to 15.60 yuan, 3,000 bags of late-month road cargo at 15.53 yuan, 300 bags of No. 2 rice at 14.80 yuan, 6,000 bags of small-sized rice at 15.35 to 14.89 yuan, 1,000 bags of glutinous rice at 13.56 yuan, 1,000 bags of large-sized rice at 14.65 to 14.55 yuan, 1,000 bags of glutinous rice at 14.88 to 14.75 yuan, and 1,000 bags of next-month brown rice at 14.30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Fluctuations in the Flour and Wheat Market <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, prices for various months generally fluctuated. With only one or two days left until delivery for the current month, the bullish expectations have not been fully realized, and the environment is not as favorable as before. Further speculation may invite criticism from outside the industry, so the bullish side has gradually released positions, and the market has calmed down. As for the distant months, sunny weather is generally seen as slightly positive, but short-term speculation has calmed the outside bullish sentiment, and they are unwilling to sell first. Therefore, it is difficult to expect significant easing until the new wheat is fully harvested. As a result, the current month was better by 0.25 cents compared to the previous day, and the June to September months remained unchanged. The October month was better by 0.25 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, prices for various months generally fluctuated. Although the bulls held firm, the recent excellent weather is highly beneficial to the prospects of the new wheat. Additionally, imported wheat prices have also slightly decreased by two or three cents, causing much uncertainty among the majority. If the wheat harvest is indeed good, this situation will be difficult to sustain. As a result, the June month was up by 1.75 cents compared to the previous day, the July month was unchanged, the August month was up by 1 cent, and the September month was down by 1 cent. The current spot wheat market remains stable. Fuxin flour mills continued to actively trade, while others remained on the sidelines. Top-grade train wheat was priced at 5.15 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat was priced at 5 yuan, with a total of 2,000 bags purchased by Fuxin.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the standard soybean cake futures market was firm. The price of Dalian-produced soybean cake was stable, and spot sales in Shanghai were extremely active. As the peak season approached, various parties gradually paid attention. Today is the last trading day for the current month's futures, so some buyers were settling their positions, and those who had shorted positions were preparing to deliver. Therefore, trading was extremely firm in both the morning and afternoon sessions. At the close, the current month's futures opened at 1.825 yuan, and the June-July futures opened at 0.8475 to 0.85 yuan, a slight increase compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Price Rises to 7.10 Yuan, Market Attractive</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market reports indicated that the current price of Cuban raw sugar was $1.375, the price of New York sugar futures for September was $1.52, February was $1.61, a decrease of one cent compared to the previous report. The price for March of next year was $1.69, a decrease of three cents. The current price of Javanese sugar was $9.75, an increase of 0.125 compared to the previous report. The price of June sugar futures was $9.50, and the price of July sugar futures was $9.375, both unchanged. The Shanghai Merchants Association's market saw an increase in the trading of Dutch No. 24 raw sugar and white sugar after the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, leading to a firmer market. Yesterday, buyers gradually became more active, with transaction prices reaching 7.10 yuan, and demand remained strong. Total transactions for the entire market were estimated to be nearly 2,000 bags, and sellers were scarce, making the market seem attractive. No. 20 medium white sugar was priced at 7.00 yuan, and the market was also not weak. Trading of Japanese sugar remained quiet. N Mark was priced at 7.575 yuan, YP Mark at 7.70 yuan, YT Mark at 7.50 yuan, and YRO Mark at 7.225 yuan, with the market showing a turning trend. The market also saw domestically produced high-grade white powder, with over a hundred bags offered at 10.04 yuan and 10.05 yuan, and the market was stable and uneventful.</p>

<p>Falling Exchange Rates Hinder Price Increases</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market continued to face difficulties. The price of gold soared again, and exchange rates declined. Although European and American firms showed no signs of declining interest in new factories, price increases were hindered. Only Xinfu and others traded 90 bales of new factory silk, and Dachang traded 20 bales of white silk, with prices remaining stable.</p>

<p>This year's silkworm season in Zhenjiang was affected by unfavorable weather, resulting in a significant loss of silkworms during the major molt. However, the improved breeds (foreign breeds) raised near the city fared better. The total cocoon harvest was only 50% of the expected amount. Cocoon shops have already opened, but the cocoon market is not as lively as in previous years. The initial price of local cocoons was only 45-50 yuan, while foreign cocoons were priced higher, currently at 65-69 yuan. The market is expected to rise, but supplies are currently limited.</p>

<p>Yesterday, interest from British firms in Qimen and Fuliang red tea waned, as the remaining high-quality teas in the market were scarce. Demand from overseas for medium and low-grade teas was not urgent, so most merchants adopted a wait-and-see attitude. However, over 4,000 boxes of Qimen tea, including some with excellent color and quality, were imported via the Yangtze River, potentially leading to a brief period of activity in the market. Green tea sales remained sluggish. The market for Zhenmei tea from Tunxi, Suian, and Shexian remained inactive, and the 60 or so boxes of Zhenmei tea from Wuyuan Dongxiang Xiaoqi also failed to open. The current stagnation in the green tea market is unprecedented in recent years.</p>

<p>The Piece Goods Industry Severely Affected</p>
<p>Several Accountants Are Already Handling Losses, Western Goods Suffering the Most</p>
<p>The trend in the cotton cloth market has been gradually softening, especially for coarse cloth, due to weak sales and increasing inventories. Consequently, market sentiment is low. Yesterday, 16-pound cloth was down one cent compared to last week, 13-pound cloth was down 0.25 cents, and 11-pound cloth remained stable. Fine cloth saw little change due to occasional purchases from northern provinces. Yesterday, Yanghe was priced at 6.875 yuan, Trumpet Boy at 6.90 yuan, and Blue Flying Fish at 7.25 yuan. Sales of fine twill were relatively quiet, but Shanghai dyeing factories frequently purchased available goods, preventing a significant decline. Yihua bleached cloth continued to fall, with Golden Three Pagodas priced at only 7.40 yuan and Clouds Beyond Fragrance at 7.60 yuan, both down slightly.</p>
<p>The recent adverse trend in Eastern and Western piece goods, influenced by drafts, is unprecedented. Merchants are suffering losses, especially on Western goods. Prices have been steadily declining, and inventories are increasing, making it difficult for many to sustain operations. One business declared closure the day before yesterday, and yesterday, two businesses, Gong and Zhong, also began handling losses. Eastern goods, despite sluggish sales, still have a considerable market, so the situation is better, but making a profit is difficult. Although tribute satin and other items have risen in price, the calculated cost still results in losses. Yesterday, some Western red label cloth was sold on Ben Street, with 6-pound Guo Ju priced at 3.80 yuan and 4-pound priced at 3.15 yuan. Chong silk was priced at 3.825 yuan, and Western silk was priced at 3.775 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Saint Augustine, a New Italian Biography by Papini <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, Giovanni Papini, the author of "Story of Christ" (Storia di Cristo), has suddenly published a new book, "Saint Augustine" (Sant' Agostino). We all know that Saint Augustine is a great figure in Catholicism, and his deeds have inspired countless writers and scholars in various countries around the world. There have been many books written about him. Étienne Gilson of France published "Introduction à l'étude de Saint Augustin" not long ago.</p>
<p>Now Papini has also come out with a "Saint Augustine". Is he trying to capitalize on the current trend of romantic biographies, the so-called "new biographical literature"? However, no, Papini has not been tempted by this. Of course, it would be easy for him to follow the fashionable approach, because Saint Augustine is not only a great "saint" but also a great "mortal". The romantic elements in his life provide ample material for a romantic biography. But Papini refuses to do so. We must remember that Papini is a naturally argumentative person. He is always opposed to the prevailing opinions of his time. In his own eyes, Papini is almost a creator, revolutionary, destructive, inspiring, creative, a hero, a reformer, a saint, and someone who once tried to write "Story of Christ" in the first-person singular as if he were "walking the path of God". Therefore, after he finished writing "Story of Christ", it was inevitable that he would write "Story of Augustine", because he has always held a personal, autobiographical view of literature and history. Moreover, the saint who wrote "Confessions" and the writer who wrote "Story of Christ" share spiritual similarities. Saint Augustine was a rhetorician, a Latinist, a grammarian, a Neo-Platonist philosopher, and a writer of paradoxical arguments. He was ultimately dissatisfied with everything. He was a mirror in which Papini was reflected, but on a grander scale. Papini himself tells the reader frankly:</p>
<p>It seems to me that there is a certain resemblance between us. He is also a man of letters and a lover of words, and a creator of philosophy and truth who is harassed, even tempted by "Occultism". He is also carnal, seeking fame. I am like him, naturally like his worst parts, but in any case, I am always like him.</p>
<p>Saint Augustine was first a sinner and later became a saint. Papini has always had deep sympathy for him. But this sympathy alone is not a sufficient reason for Papini to write "Saint Augustine". It is not only because of the similarity in Western temperament, but also because there is a very important and deep connection between them. This connection is that they are both Catholic writers and both underwent major spiritual upheavals before converting to Catholicism. After experiencing countless intellectual truths, they finally found spiritual peace. In our opinion, this book is Papini's answer. The question is, "Papini, why did you convert to Catholicism?" Papini seems to answer, "Look at this man, he is much greater than I. Look at how he chose his path. I have done nothing but follow in his footsteps."</p>
<p>················</p>
<p>In the preface of this book, Papini solemnly declares his purpose in writing it:</p>
<p>My purpose is to retell the external and internal life of this great African man with the greatest simplicity, clearly indicating where the certain facts end and the probable conjectures begin. Of course, this is not to explain "Confessions" again line by line, because that book only goes up to the age of thirty-three and does not continue. However, the intention of this book is not to fully explain the thoughts of this great saint, because to say nothing of the entirety of his thoughts, even a general discussion of his philosophy, his theology, or his mysticism would make this book even longer. So my intention is only to tell the story of a soul.</p>
<p>But after reading this book, we cannot help but say that Papini's explanation is somewhat unconvincing, because the general reader would rather Papini frankly choose one of two paths: either purely create a work of art, as his reputation demands, or write a history on the subject. But now Papini is not taking either of these paths. His current work can slightly arouse our attention, but it does not make us read it attentively or enthusiastically. As for the soul of Augustine, although he says he wants to write a history of this soul, he rarely depicts this soul. When he does depict it, it is indeed depicted very powerfully, but unfortunately he loves to write about passions too much, especially those base passions. Of course, we can also see from this that Papini, like Augustine, indulges in carnal passions and likes to talk about them often. However, this is somewhat contradictory to his own statement.</p>
<p>After all, "fame is difficult to live up to". His position is too high, and readers' expectations for him are inevitably too high. What he gives us in this book is indeed very different from what we hope to get from this book. What he gives us is neither romance nor history, but a genuine picture of a saint's life and the times in which he lived, written in a calm and light style. Of course, there are a few pages in this book that are written very beautifully, such as the last chapter.</p>

<p>Chapter 41: German Literature After Goethe</p>
<p>We have arrived at the doorstep of modern times. Here we encounter the singular figure of the poet and philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. Nietzsche is, first and foremost, an artist, a great artist. He is also a thinker who has spoken to humanity more than anyone else about the most central teachings of modern thought, believing that morality, like the material world, is something that changes and lives, not something that is unchanging and dead. Therefore, man can completely transcend his present self. This idea of change and the superman is a seed, a yeast that ferments the entirety of modern life. What makes this and everything that follows shine like a flame is the incomparable power of Nietzsche's words. Not only in "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", but also in all of his other works, in "The Revaluation of All Values", in "Human, All Too Human", we encounter the great creative speaker. His words burn, fly, and sing. His books carry a message that resonates in the hearts of the people of this new era, with a persuasiveness and eloquence comparable to that of the Gospels, and the ecstatic beauty of his language. His books are full of deeply meaningful aphorisms, which unfold new vistas towards "man and nature and life". And above all, he also possesses the mark of a wise man who is also a poet, who gives life and breath to those aphorisms, often making them part of the structure of a lyrical poem, a fable. To understand the latest revolution in German literature, we must remember that in 1880, Hebbel, Keller, Meyer, and Nietzsche were not yet fully famous. The public was watching inferior dramas imitating the works of Augier and Dumas fils, and reading sentimental novels and poems drained from the dregs of Romanticism, lacking original beauty and power. Then the young people of the early 1880s rose up in rebellion, organized societies, published manifestos, promoted the theory of thorough naturalism, and established a powerful literary movement. Arno Holz's pamphlets and models soon bore fruit. The true poets Detlev von Liliencron and the great playwright Gerhart Hauptmann appeared. The novel was slightly behind, but this was not for long. A new literature was born.</p>
<p>Together with Liliencron, the lyrical poetry, often the glory of German literature, regained its precise and sharp and true character. His songs and folk songs, in the midst of them, contained soldiers and wine and bread. And at the same time, although he precisely and vividly arranged small things, he discovered for German poetry the beautiful, rigorous forms. Under the leadership of Liliencron, lyrical poetry burst forth. The next and perhaps the most outstanding poet of all is Richard Dehmel. To Liliencron's brilliance and precision, Dehmel added a philosophical imagination and power that transferred the entire spirit of modern life, the mechanical complexity, into poetry. In this respect, he stands apart from the poets of Europe. He could write folk songs and also write with the simplicity of medieval hymns. However, in a hundred individual poems and in the legend of "Two Souls", his most remarkable achievement lies in creating modern men and women living on bicycles, making telephone calls, writing poems about women playing the piano next door, and speaking of these things with poems that are vivid and noble.</p>

<p>China Samsung Company announces that the quality of our country's ink has always been poor, and the written words are easily smeared and altered. In recent years, cases of tampering with checks, account books, wills, and other important documents have become increasingly common. People in all sectors of society are paying attention to this matter. As a result, scientists have begun to research a new method to prevent fraud, which is to replace ordinary ink with a product called Insurance Ink. The inventor is chemist Huang Letian. After drying, the color of this Insurance Ink is not only exceptionally glossy, but the written words have been tested by soaking in clear water for three months without any blurring. Attempts to wash it with chemical solutions also failed to remove the words. This shows that the ink adheres to the paper in such a way that it cannot be altered, thus preventing fraud. Although Insurance Ink is a common commodity, it has important functions. Therefore, all checks, drafts, account books, wills, official documents, notices, and important documents in all sectors should be written with Insurance Ink. Insurance Ink is produced by this company and is now available on the market.</p>

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government has issued a top-grade commendation certificate to encourage him.
