<p>景山丸不依航則行駛　　新豐上層台甲均撞毁　　即日開回上海將大修日輪肇禍已數見不鮮此次招商局之北洋正班船新豐號由滬赴津行至塘沽口又被日輪撞壞損失至巨茲將此事詳情特再分記如後</p>
<p>日輪肇禍眞相招商局新豐輪九日上午六時許開抵距塘沽海口約有二海哩船方駛進白河而日本郵船會社之神户天津班輪景山丸適由津沽駛出該地海面較狹近日水勢又减照例景山丸應向外擋行駛距意日人不照航海規章竟向新豐輪行駛之航道内一直綫迎面開來及至兩船相近新豐船主馬遜見日輪劈面開來乃急拉回聲促其速向外避詎日船置若岡聞在霎那間兩船已近比由新豐急切讓退顧已不及轟然一聲日輪已撞入新豐船上而巨禍乃成矣</p>
<p>新豐損害甚大日輪景山丸排水景在四千噸左右船身巨大速力尤猛如迎面碰撞新豐必遭沈失幸其來撞時新豐打倒車避退然該輪二層艙與三層台甲等已被景山丸船頭撞撃而此兩層之艙位客室以及上層台甲之建築物等完全撞毁甚至在艙面之救命舢舨船亦被其毁壞三隻新豐之輪之二三兩層艙幾大半毁滅損失之巨可知苟旅客不早逃出必釀重大慘劇也</p>
<p>日輪自認過失此事發生以後經新豐船主馬遜檢視被禍損壞狀况即向景山丸船主交涉昨日滬局接得馬遜船主由津來電謂本船被毁之處已經偕同日輪船長親自觀看繪成圖樣備交涉根據日人自知理屈當塲由景山丸船主簽立承認肇禍負責之憑證業由馬遜氏船主收執矣</p>
<p>新豐到津卸貨新豐輪在檢騐損失之後猶幸貨艙未曾撞破故船舶仍可行駛當經領江引導駛入天津紫竹林碼頭停泊船内旅客僅受虚驚未有傷害刻下均安然上陸各艙貨件亦在起卸之中尚無損壞情事</p>
<p>今日可以離津現因二三層乘客台甲多半毁損非入塢大修殊難行駛該輪定今日由津開行回滬昨日滬局續得津電言新豐輪對於天津來貨照常裝運惟乘客則一槪不搭船主爲愼重航行計已令業務主任停止售票矣其損失數額尚須俟該輪來滬以後方能明悉關於交涉及向日輪索賠等事滬局亦須候新豐船到詢明肇禍原由及經過狀况之後再由船務科等估核損失進行索賠</p>

<p>— 衛中博士講　楊綽然朱克濂筆記</p>
<p>我們都是好比當差的人管理我們的人講什麽我們就做什麽祇是會服從命令爲什麽因爲腦力不夠人類的腦力是不夠得很的人類在歷史裏面講革命統通是空話歷史裏面的革命不是革命不過是以前有一個皇帝以後來了幾個皇帝罷了歷史裏面的民國的人都是當差的按他人的命令去革命在革命時期仍然是當差的仍然是服從命令的革命歷史裏面無論天下那一個的民國都是這樣爲什麽這樣呢因爲人類的腦力很少爲什麽腦力會這樣不行呢就是因爲經過數千年的時間有了宗敎宗敎怎樣給人類的腦力變少呢宗敎斬斷過自然界與人類的身體和腦子的關係截斷了這個關係人類的腦力就消滅了這個説明就是科學的説明因爲人類的腦子要靠身體身體要靠自然界没有自然界就没有人類的身體没有身體就没有腦子常常用與身體與自然界没關係的腦一定用完了腦力試看書獃子學問愈深講話愈空他講很多空話以爲他人看不出他的話之空洞他祇是講話至於事實不用講他不會講事實什麽事實都不明白因爲他的腦力很多</p>
<p>現在到了講演的很重要的部分</p>
<p>人類腦力已經到了完全不行的時候如果我們知道這個我們可以説明[書]人用無論什麽方法還要做一個好比有腦力的樣子完全没有腦力的人到無論什麽地方找假面具用無論什麽方法使别人不知道他是没有經騐的他成全没有看見過動物却要學習動物學愈不看動物愈要學習動物學學習後動物學的名詞都知道了然後别人查不出他實在没有看見過動物没有東西可是有了名詞　名詞好比舞臺上的唱戲的假面裝模什樣的假面之内面不一定是怎麽樣可是從外邊看去很像個樣子胡適之先生説過打倒名敎的話這也略可以證明名詞是人類最危險的假面比方我愈無思想我就愈用名詞以自蔽其無思想因爲名詞是從書本得來的愈無思想便愈看書如果他不看書别人可以看出他没有思想所以他便以爲看書要緊看過歐州的書然後知道歐州因爲有了書别人查不出來我實在對於歐州什麽都不知道剽竊他人的思想摭拾他人的經騐以自代其思想與經騐就是書把他人的思想拿來替代自已的思想把他人的經騐拿來替代自已的經騐就是看書之目的</p>
<p>所以一般人都偑服［書］偑服很深思想可以不要經騐可以不要祇用一點錢去買他人的思想和經騐那麽不是方便得多嗎用自已的思想找自已的經騐要耗竭多少力量身體不想動腦子也不想動買書來看看練習講話愈不識事物愈會講話那不是好嗎那不是方便得多嗎去調查礦物嗎太麻煩要跑路要受太陽晒討厭極了到不如買六毛錢礦物學的書在家裏看看方便得多多了</p>
<p>按剛才的話説來所以宗敎令人的腦力消滅以後還要做第二個［令人不知道自已是無腦力的］用書令他看來替代他的思想和他的經騐如此在宗敎文化之下的大部分人一世没有發生過一個思想常有書來替代自已思想所以完全不知道他没有思想的我們可以拿一比方來説明一個最大的困難比方我有病我知道我有病可以療治可是有病而不自知却自以爲無病那麽没有别的比這個更要危險罷所以現在的靑年學生都馬馬乎乎的上堂看書今天當學生明天當敎員試問他［你的腦力怎樣你對於什麽思想］那被問者倒會反問着你［腦力麽什麽是腦力］他完全不道腦力因爲他看書時完全未用過腦力没有用過自已的思想祇用過别人的思想祇看過書没有用過他自已的思想祇用過别人的腦力現在敎育要人看書是使人類消滅腦力的方法這個是很危險的賣女子落妓院很不對可是强男子進書房更不對比方妓女很破的身體却穿上很好的衣裳藉外面的華麗的衣服以蔽着她底殘破的身體恰如學生有一個無思想的腦子却偷到很好聴的名詞用假面般的名詞來蔽上他底空洞的腦子一樣</p>
<p>這就是［現在敎育與書本的關係］第一部分的講演完了</p>
<p>現在到了第二部分的講演［以後的敎育與電影的關係］</p>
<p>新的敎育科學時代的敎育到現在世界上還是没有的爲什麽到現在還是没有科學時代的新敎育呢因爲科學時代到現在還没有到但是我們是現在人類歷史裏一個最要緊的時期的人什麽時期的人呢就是宗敎時代開始預備變過去要變到科學時代的時期的人現在三十至四十歲的人或者二十至十歲的人還是宗敎時代的人可是科學時代的曙光一定快到了科學思想在美國雖然是很發逹可是科學時代的成功問題還談不到科學時代的敎育在無論什麽地方還是没有的我們在動的敎育實騐揚發明找去一條路徑也可説是創造一條路徑因爲未曾有預備好了的路徑科學時代還没有到科學時代的敎育自然還没有到現在只是一種希望不是已經成過功的</p>
<p>預備科學時代的敎育的方法與舊的方法恰是相反這個科學時代的意思是完全新的非你先用身體你不可以用腦無論什麽活動都要靠身體非有外面的刺激不能夠有内部的安排法</p>
<p>一説這話便可以知道爲什麽在科學時代裏的新敎育電影這樣要緊電常有東西的刺激没有一個時候没有刺激一非先有身體活動不可以有腦子的</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>活動］這話在明天看電影裏可以得到證明我們明天的有聲的電影常是先　身體的活動然後有話的活動　影裏面的主演人Mary　Duncau的表演很高等她講話以前先有身的活動例如她駡男子不行駡男子都是欺負女子的没有程度對待女子的她推開他他的腦子與全體都有一個表示看不起男子的態度以後她説［你們都是一樣的］她先用全體去打以後才發出打倒他們的話來這話在電影片上可以看出是怎樣從身體發出來的電影界的演員很少能夠用這樣表演法她的話清清楚楚的從她的身體活動發生出來的又當她在船上她的身體貼近Aleen　Sohn時説“I　sh　　make　you　Happy,　Happler　Than　any　other　woman　ever　coutd”她説話的姿勢的活動比較她的聲音的發生還要在先　　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Armistice Commemoration <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Today, as we commemorate the anniversary of the armistice that ended the European War, it coincides with the preparatory conference for disarmament. The armistice commemoration serves to remember the brutality of the European War, hoping to achieve lasting peace and prevent future large-scale wars. The disarmament preparatory conference aims to prepare for achieving this goal of lasting peace and preventing future large-scale wars. Therefore, on the day of the disarmament conference, if one thinks of the brutal state of the Great War and recalls the devastation caused by armies slaughtering people and disrupting the world, then everything can be resolved without conflict. However, in the eleven years since the armistice of the Great War, there have been annual commemorations, and disarmament conferences have been held almost every year for the past five years. Yet, the solemn and remorseful arguments during commemorations completely transform at the disarmament negotiating table. They fear insufficient preparation of these instruments of harm to the people and squabble to compete. This is not that the solemn and remorseful arguments are false; the concern for protecting humanity cannot match the urgency of each country's self-interest. If each acts for their own country, they will each think of how to protect their national defense. When suspicion of others invading their country arises, the thought of conflict arises. It is like within a country, if party and political leaders are too concerned with preserving their territory, internal strife will never cease. If they put aside the concern for territory and focus on serving the country and the people, they will be loved and supported by the people, and no one will be able to compete with them. This is an inevitable principle. Therefore, countries in the world today that want to act in their own interests should not invade other countries to benefit themselves but should focus on improving their internal affairs and devote all their efforts to alleviating the people's livelihood, allowing the people to rest peacefully in this pervasive tide of economic decline and not be overwhelmed. If each acts for their own country in this way, it will not only benefit themselves but also benefit other countries. If we have no intention of invading others, then others will not defend against us, and suspicion will have no grounds to arise. If we focus solely on seeking self-interest, then everyone will be wary of each other. This is the main reason for the inability to achieve peace. However, looking at the countries today, they are still unable to avoid this, which is why disarmament discussions have repeatedly failed and become increasingly fractured. There are commemorations of regretting disaster, but no conferences of regretting disaster. One cannot help but worry about the future of peace. Domestic Important Telegrams Two.</p>

<p>Nanjing. Liang Guanying stated that although Zhang Zhijiang is still modest about the position of Commissioner for Pacification of Jiangsu, Jiang will definitely urge him to take office after arriving in Nanjing, and he will not firmly decline. It is still difficult to predict the duration of his stay in Nanjing, as matters concerning the transportation and stationing of the Zheng troops, as well as the division of areas for bandit suppression, must be discussed in detail with Commissioner Zhang. He has already received several copies of military land maps for distribution to various departments for application. He believes that bandit suppression is the most glorious task for soldiers, and its value is far superior to that of civil war. After the troops arrive in Jiangsu, they will exert all their efforts to eliminate harm for the people, and they must pay attention to the geography, customs, local conditions, and the sources of banditry in various places. He has contributed little to the Party and the country in the past, but he will fulfill his responsibilities in bandit suppression so that his conscience can be at ease. (10th Telegram)</p>

<p>Accounting for 29% of the total budget, supplementary plan negotiations resolved. Toho News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - Due to the compromise in the establishment of the army and navy budgets, the estimated budget for Showa 6 is 1.442 billion yuan. The amount of savings in fixed expenditures is slightly less than 130 million yuan. The total amount of revival requests approved by various provinces is about 32 million yuan, which is 14 million yuan more than the amount of savings expected by the Ministry of Finance. Also, the total amount of military expenditure of the Japanese army and navy in Showa 4 accounted for 29% of the total budget, ranking first in the world, followed by Italy at 24%, France at 22%, America at 21%, and England at 15%.</p>
<p>Toho News Agency, Tokyo, 10th - The army budget negotiations were completed at 12:30 AM this morning. Next, the navy budget negotiations between Ministers Inoue and Abe were also actively negotiated, and the biggest obstacle was finally broken through this morning. To facilitate the final decision at tomorrow's regular cabinet meeting, the accounting was urgently reorganized together with the budgets of the various provinces. Although the national defense supplementary plan, which was negotiated from last night until this morning, was inevitably greatly reduced, the Ministry of Finance spiritually recognized the navy's claims, and the portion that could not be realized due to the allocation of reserved financial resources will be realized after Showa 11 (1936). The specific plan will continue to be discussed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Navy.</p>

<p>Taiwanese Governor-General Asks the Noble House for Understanding, Troops Prepare to Withdraw</p>
<p>Toho News, Wushe, 10th - It was previously wrongly reported that Taiwanese aborigine leader Hanooka Ichiro had died. It has now been confirmed that he was found wearing a kimono and committed suicide. Beside his body, his wife and children were also wearing kimonos and committed suicide, a truly tragic sight. In addition to Hanooka Ichiro, the punitive expedition also found the bodies of 20 aborigines, most of whom committed suicide due to being in a hopeless situation. According to the Police Affairs Bureau, the total number of Japanese mainlanders sacrificed in this aborigine uprising was 122, 17 were missing, and 260 survived.</p>

It is feared that the House of Peers will raise this issue as a major agenda item when the regular session of this year's Diet opens. Also, at 1 PM on the 10th, the Japanese Ministry of the Army announced that the troops sent by the Taiwanese army have occupied the base of the rebels and have swept away most of them.

<p>The Baukys faction still controls the Lower House, and extremist elements have been completely excluded.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Vienna, 10th - Yesterday's Austrian general election was completely different from Germany's recent elections. The election was calm and peaceful, which was unexpected by many people. The result was that extremist elements were completely excluded, and the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party failed to win a single seat in parliament. It was widely expected beforehand that the Social Democrats would lose three or four of their original 71 seats in parliament, but the actual result was that they gained three seats, bringing their total to 74, the most seats in the entire parliament. The Christian Social Party originally held 73 seats but only won 68 seats this time. However, although the Christian Social Party's power has been slightly reduced, the so-called Baukys coalition will still control the Lower House because it still has 17 seats from the Economic Group and 7 seats from the Family Group. The Lower House has a total of 165 seats, and the faction currently holds 91 seats, so the majority is still in their hands. It is still difficult to predict the impact of this election result on politics, but it is said that perhaps Huber will be appointed to reorganize the new cabinet according to the wishes of the Baukys faction.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 9th - The results of the election for the 165 seats in the Austrian Parliament have now been announced. The Christian Party won 53 seats, the Social Democratic Party won 57 seats, and the National Economic Party and the Farmers' Party won 11 seats. All important politicians were elected. The Christian Party has been the majority party in parliament for eight years and has been able to maintain its power in coalition with the Greater German Party, the Farmers' Party, and the Anti-Socialist Party. The Greater German Party and the Farmers' Party have now formed a new party led by former Prime Minister Schubel.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 9th - Yesterday, rumors spread that Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden, First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, and Secretary of State for India Benn were about to resign. However, official circles denied this. Last night, British Prime Minister MacDonald issued a statement from his residence, stating that the report in a certain newspaper regarding the attitude of three cabinet members towards the Liberal Party's unemployment proposals was completely inaccurate. There was absolutely no difference of opinion within the cabinet on this issue. Snowden also told people yesterday that the talk of a cabinet split was purely intentional rumor-mongering and completely untrue. Alexander also stated that cabinet members were completely unaware of the political upheaval mentioned in a certain newspaper. Minister of Public Works Lansbury said in a speech in Bobish last night that cabinet members were united in their opinions on fundamental policy principles. The Labor government would never resign unless it was overthrown, and there was no possibility of the government being overthrown at present, and an election was unlikely within three years.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Hanover, 9th - After the German Democratic Party reorganized into the National Party, it dissolved the Democratic Party yesterday. Today, the inaugural meeting of the National Party was convened, and the current Minister of Finance of the Federal Government, Dietrich, was officially elected as president. It is reported that the reorganization of the party occurred a few weeks before the general election. At that time, President Koch-Weser strongly advocated for the reorganization, and the committee decided to reorganize the new party to absorb the Young German League to strengthen its power. Unexpectedly, the party only wanted to use this as a trick to get elected, and as soon as the election was over, it turned its back on its original intentions, left the new party, and joined the right wing. As a result, Koch-Weser resigned to take responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e49">German Metal Industry Wage Cut Arbitration <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Public Outcry Follows Announcement, Receiving Significant Attention from All Sides</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th - People here are paying close attention to the agreement to cut metal industry wages by 3% this year and successively reduce them to 8% next year, considering it a move that will affect Europe. The wage cut in the metal industry is seen as a precursor to wage reductions in other industries. With lower labor costs, production costs will be lighter, and the prices of German goods will also decrease to compete with products from other countries. Efforts are also being made to reduce food prices, but wheat and frozen goods are still difficult. Metal manufacturing plants are now working to reduce prices.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 9th - The arbitration result of the German metalworkers' wage cut dispute has attracted attention not only within the industry but also from the entire business community. The strike of 130,000 workers for two weeks was purely in opposition to the employer's proposed 8% wage cut. However, the arbitration result still maintains the employer's original proposal, only extending the implementation period to January 18th. At this time, a 3% wage cut will be implemented first, hoping that there will be two months to depreciate prices and reduce living expenses to alleviate the suffering of workers. Last night, because the arbitration result was announced late, there was no reaction. Today, the labor community is in an uproar, with the extreme left and right factions stirring up trouble, strongly criticizing the deception of the Social Democratic Party's trade union for letting workers resume work first and being sold out. (It is noted that previously, only the Social Democratic Party had trade unions in Germany, but recently, the labor community has begun to split, with Communist trade unions appearing.)</p>

The reason was that the pilot of the aircraft expressed special concern for the aviator Franco, who was imprisoned for opposing the Spanish government, which led to misunderstandings and accusations of interfering in Spanish internal affairs. As a result, the German ambassador negotiated with the Spanish government, explaining that the visit of the G-38 was only to test the opening of a passenger airline and had no political significance. The Spanish authorities then released it.</p>

<p>Forcing Passengers to Get Off the Tram and Disrupting Business - Dentsu, Osaka, 10th - At 6:00 a.m. yesterday, a tram on the Keihan Electric Railway's Keishin Line, which was traveling from Otsu to the Otani Station, was suddenly attacked by five suspicious men resembling members of the Keihan Electric Railway Dispute Group, who used pistols to force passengers to get off the tram and opened the empty tram at full speed, causing it to derail and overturn before fleeing in a car. The strike group's retaliatory measures against the capitalists were the most heinous in recent years. The authorities are strictly investigating the perpetrators.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Telegram from Kaifeng <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>To the Editors of All Newspapers: We have learned that Disaster Relief Committee members Wang Fangting and Chen Liangfu, along with Liang Gongwu, the magistrate of Kaocheng County, have jointly reported that Kaocheng is located at a critical point on the battle line and has been for more than half a year. People have been conscripted into the army, and over 10,800 people have been injured, killed, or displaced with no means of support. Over 3,200 houses have been burned down, along with 2,200 large carts and 6,600 head of cattle and horses. Over 22,000 yuan has been levied in cash, and over 54,000 yuan has been requisitioned in grain. Other property losses are estimated at over 100,000 yuan. There are 37 trenches running across the land, occupying 625,000 feet of farmland. These are all quantifiable figures, and the indirect damage is incalculable. Now that winter is approaching, there is widespread displacement. We earnestly request relief to save the remnants of the population. The county is located in a war zone and has suffered heavy losses. The cold winds are forcing people to huddle by the roadside, and the fires of hunger are burning, with those in the ditches barely breathing. Now that the military conflict has ended, relief efforts cannot be delayed. We humbly request Your Excellency to quickly allocate grain and funds to provide humanitarian assistance and extend the lifeline of the nation. We eagerly await your command. Zhang Fang, of the Henan Province Relief Commission, respectfully bows.</p>

<h3 id="e54">The Central Committee and National Government's Memorial Week <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 10th, the Central Committee of the Party held its 85th weekly memorial service for the Premier in the grand hall of the Central Party Headquarters. Central Committee members Ma Chaojun, Zhu Jiahua, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Fang Juehui, Zhang Zhen, Wang Boling, Kexinge, Yu Jingtang, Chen Yaoyuan, and others, as well as officials from various departments and commissions and guests, totaling approximately 500 people, attended. Chairman Ma Chaojun presided over the ceremony. Zhu Jiahua gave a report, stating that he had just arrived in Nanjing from Guangzhou and, based on his experience in education over the past few months, believed that intensifying educational work was a fundamental requirement for party and national construction. He then elaborated on the following points: (1) Education based on the Three Principles of the People is clearly stipulated in the party's educational policy. The party and education are inextricably linked and must be united as one. Separating them into two would be dangerous. Recently, there have been reactionary elements scheming and engaging in activities in schools, creating political obstacles. This is because they have fundamentally failed to understand the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, the responsibility must be attributed to education. The most important task in modern education is to ensure that the general public has a clear and unwavering understanding of the principles so that the principles can be realized and education can have value. (2) The center of construction lies in economics and talent, with talent being even more critical than economics. The construction guidelines issued by the Central Committee, from the province to the county, are often stalled or shelved. In some cases, workers in a county lack the knowledge of building construction and do not even know what a blueprint is. How can construction be properly carried out? This example shows that education and construction are closely related. To carry out construction, it is essential to focus on education. (3) Chinese culture has a long and brilliant history and holds an important position in the world. This is undeniable by both China and foreign countries. However, today, China lags behind in everything, and its inherent culture is on the verge of extinction. This is extremely dangerous. The lives of Chinese people are more difficult than those of any other country. While this is partly due to the social environment, the biggest reason is the low level of knowledge. To seek survival and happiness for humanity, it is necessary to use the effectiveness of education to increase their knowledge. (4) Recently, reports of internal disputes and disturbances in universities have been common, which is regrettable. Education is the mother of all things. If internal stability cannot be maintained, how can talent be cultivated and how can any cause be achieved? From the party's perspective, it is necessary to resolve these issues quickly without hesitation, lest education be fundamentally and significantly affected. (5) The rebellion of Yan and Feng caused significant sacrifices and losses for the central government and local areas. Although the suppression of the rebellion has been successful, the vitality is difficult to restore quickly. While Yan and Feng have the ambitions of warlords and do not hesitate to harm the people and the country, if intellectuals had not participated in the rebellion, their arrogance might not have been so great. It can even be said that the Yan-Feng rebellion was caused by intellectuals. It can be seen that the level of national knowledge is related to the governance and stability of the country. Therefore, fundamental construction lies in providing a solid foundation for national education. The meeting was adjourned after the report. The National Government also held a weekly memorial service for the Premier at 10:00 AM. Zhu Peide, Yang Shuzhuang, Ma Fuxiang, Jiang Menglin, Yi Peiji, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Ruiheng, Lin Xiang, Chou Ao, Wei Daoming, Chen Yi, Li Jinlun, Chen Yu, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Wohua, Wu Siyu, and over 200 officials from the National Government's civil service and military affairs departments attended. Chairman Zhu Peide presided over the ceremony, and Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report: "[Today, I will briefly report on three matters related to domestic and international affairs.] The Preparatory Committee for the Disarmament Conference of the League of Nations opened on the 6th, aiming to draft a disarmament agreement for discussion at the formal disarmament conference next year. The most important points of this draft agreement, which has been underway for five years, are: (1) reduction of land, sea, and air military equipment; (2) reduction of other applicable items of land, sea, and air forces; (3) restriction of military budgets of various countries; (4) prohibition of chemical weapons warfare; and (5) miscellaneous provisions. The above five points are all very proper and urgently needed. However, there may be many disputes at this conference. Relations between France and Italy have not been very good recently, especially regarding the issue of naval equality, and they do not yield to each other. Even between Britain, France, and Italy, there does not seem to be any deep understanding. Russia is putting on a high show and watching from the sidelines. Under these circumstances, it is indeed not easy to obtain a satisfactory solution. In short, some countries at the conference take facts as the premise and only consider their own interests and security; some countries use ideals as a slogan and deliberately make things difficult; and some countries, due to their status, may not be respected internationally even if they express fair views. Therefore, the atmosphere at the first meeting was tense, and the future results are still unknown. The Fourth Plenary Session will open on the 12th of this month. Now that the military suppression of the rebellion has ended, it is urgent to refresh politics, and the Fourth Plenary Session is a major key to refreshing politics. Its significance is unimaginable. The Central Committee is very confident in its overall reorganization, because the success of all undertakings depends on determination and perseverance. The Central Committee's determination to refresh politics is very clear, and we can be even more confident in our future perseverance. With determination, we can go all out and overcome all kinds of difficulties. With perseverance, we can persist to the end and reach our destination. If politics can get on the right track from now on, and the new life of the Republic of China can be promoted and nurtured from this point on, then it will be the supreme happiness of the people of the whole country. The Industrial and Commercial Conference closed last Saturday. Representatives from various ministries and commissions of the Central Committee and provincial and municipal governments, as well as leaders and experts from the industrial and commercial sectors, gathered together and repeatedly discussed and carefully decided on more than 400 proposals within eight days, which is truly rare. The resolutions of each case are of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Through this conference, the government has a clearer understanding of the real situation of the industrial and commercial sectors, and the industrial and commercial sectors have a clearer understanding of the government's sincere intention to support the industrial and commercial sectors. In the future, the government will promptly remove obstacles and actively promote and encourage. The industrial and commercial sectors will also make special efforts to cooperate sincerely with the government. In short, the conference has now closed, and there is still much work to be done. We hope and believe that by the time the second conference is held, the situation of industry and commerce across the country will have improved significantly, unlike the current situation, which is often in danger."</p>
<h3 id="e55">Zhang Xueliang's Preparations Before Entering the Pass <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>First Inspecting Military and Political Facilities in Tianjin and Hebei, with Accompanying Staff Divided into Four Departments, Communications from Shenyang: Zhang Xueliang had long prepared to enter the pass. The main reasons were: first, to inspect the military and political situation in Tianjin and Hebei to facilitate reorganization; and second, to meet with Commander-in-Chief Chiang to discuss the aftermath in the north. The reason for the delay was that representatives from various parties came one after another for consultations. Amidst these ongoing discussions with no clear direction, it was inconvenient to ignore them. Moreover, at the beginning of the troops taking over defenses in Tianjin and Hebei, thorough planning was required for the front lines and especially the rear. Meetings were held repeatedly, wasting time. Furthermore, the organization of the Deputy Commander's Office seemed to require its establishment before proceeding. Therefore, Zhang's departure date was repeatedly postponed. Currently, the following points have been resolved separately by Zhang: (1) The issue of Yan's aftermath has been telegraphed to the central government for consultation. However, a thorough solution will require a fundamental decision after meeting with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Zhang expressed this to the representatives of the cabinet, Wen Chouquan and Liang Ruzhou, yesterday. (2) The issue of Shi's aftermath has been satisfactorily resolved. Zhang agreed to allocate 600,000 yuan in military pay each month, with the defense area set along the Pinghan Line in the Shunde area. Shi is scheduled to leave Shenyang on the 7th, passing through Tianjin and Hebei, and may stay for some time to meet with Wang Shuchang and Yu Xuezhong. (3) Regarding the organization of the Deputy Commander's Office, Zhang previously telegraphed the central government, stating that it was scheduled to be established at the beginning of this month. Currently, most preparations are complete, and the fixed number of personnel, both civil and military, totals 151, with 117 military officials and 34 civil officials. The military officials include 37 directors, deputy directors, section chiefs, chief advisers, chiefs of staff, advisers, and staff officers, all of whom are appointed to positions with the ranks of lieutenant general, major general, or colonel. There are also 51 staff officers, adjutants, section members, section chiefs, and section clerks, all of whom are delegated to positions with the ranks of lieutenant colonel or major. There are also 29 adjutants, section clerks, dispatchers, and clerks, all of whom are commissioned to positions with the ranks of captain, lieutenant, or second lieutenant. The civil officials include 10 directors, secretaries, counselors, directors, and section chiefs, all of whom are appointed to positions. There are also 8 section chiefs, section clerks, investigators, and secretaries, all of whom are delegated to positions. There are also 16 clerks, secretaries, recorders, and employees, all of whom are commissioned to positions. All of the above tasks have been clarified, and Zhang has begun to prepare for entering the pass. It is planned that, in addition to He Fenglin and Wang Shuhan accompanying him, four departments will be organized for convenience: (1) General Affairs Department: Zhu Guangmu; (2) Secretariat: Ye Biliang; (3) Staff Department: Bao Wenwei; and (4) Adjutant Department: Huang Xiansheng. The internal staff of each department has also been largely assigned to handle the affairs of the headquarters. Zhang's itinerary is decided as follows: the first step is to go to Tianjin to investigate the local military and political facilities, and the second step is to go to Beiping to inspect the stationed troops. Although there are various rumors about the location of the meeting with Commander-in-Chief Chiang, such as Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, or Nanjing, nothing is final. The location will be determined temporarily by Chiang and Zhang. Zhang's guards have been ordered to depart, taking the Beijing-Ningbo train to Huludao first. The cavalry unit departed on the night of the 3rd, the pistol team departed on the night of the 4th, and the infantry unit departed at 3:00 PM on the 5th, all arriving in Tianjin to await orders. Zhang's departure date is set for the 7th of this month. The Shenyang Railway Station has prepared a special train and started the fire yesterday, waiting for departure. It is reported that the two army commanders, Wang Shuchang and Yu Xuezhong, have coordinated welcome arrangements. Yu Xuezhong also ordered Han Mengxiong, the commander of the first squadron of the Northeast armored train, and Zhao Liangbi, the commander of the second squadron, to lead the team to Shenyang as the escort train for Zhang's departure (6th).</p>
<h3 id="e56">The Problem of Prohibiting the Planting of Tobacco Seedlings in Southern Fujian <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The government ordered the stationed troops to jointly and strictly prohibit it. The Central Anti-Smoking Commission previously received a request from the Fujian Provincial Anti-Smoking Commission to forward a telegram to the National Government, instructing the troops in Fujian Province to jointly and strictly prohibit the planting of tobacco seedlings with the county governments. If tobacco seedlings are found, the stationed troops and local officials should be punished together. The case was approved by the Executive Yuan in Directive No. 2841 and forwarded to the National Government for review. The commission also instructed the Fujian Provincial Anti-Smoking Commission to take note. It is now reported that the National Government, after receiving the report, has instructed the headquarters and the troops stationed in Fujian to comply and maintain the anti-smoking policy.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Shandong Province Supplements the Levy of Head Tax and Land Tax <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Wang Xiangrong, Director of the Finance Department, stated that due to the current extreme financial difficulties in the province, he recently requested and obtained approval from the provincial government to uniformly supplement the levy of the head tax and land tax for the 19th year in all counties that had not remitted it to the provincial government but had instead used it to subsidize military expenses. The subsidized funds would be allocated by the provincial treasury in installments over the years. The text of the announcement issued by the department is as follows: "[It is found that the head tax and land tax account for the majority of Shandong's annual revenue, and the entire year's expenditure relies on it. However, since the outbreak of the war, the finances have become increasingly chaotic. Various counties in southern Shandong, western Shandong, and eastern Jiaodong have either fallen into war zones or been occupied by miscellaneous troops, and Jin troops have illegally occupied Hebei for an especially long time. The majority of military expenses have been provided by the head tax and land tax. Fortunately, the war has subsided and order has gradually been restored. However, the losses in tax revenue are too great, and how can the annual budget be maintained? The Director of this department has been pondering day and night, unable to bear the distress. At this time of decline and unhealed wounds, we are unwilling to lightly discuss increasing the levy and burdening the people again, and other taxes yield little revenue, making it difficult to remedy the situation. In the absence of any other feasible method, as a way to make up for the shortfall, we are imitating the method of the former Director Yuan to supplement the levy of the head tax and land tax for the 18th year and plan to supplement the levy of the head tax and land tax for the 19th year used to subsidize military expenses, in order to provide relief and allocate the subsidized military expenses from the provincial treasury in installments over the years. This is in the nature of a loan and does not increase the burden on the people. It has been approved and implemented by the Provincial Political Conference. In addition to issuing an order to all counties to comply and open the levy within a time limit, we hereby issue an announcement to all the people of the province for their knowledge.] (December 8th)"</p>
<h3 id="e58">Shandong Will Establish a Agar-Agar Training Institute <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Agar-agar, a type of food in our country, all comes from Japan, where it is called "kanten." The total value of annual imports to various parts of our country is over 600,000 yuan. Liang Daoyuan, a native of Huang County in this province, has traveled to Japan three times to join workers in learning the manufacture of agar-agar. The raw material for agar-agar is a type of seaweed, which in our country is commonly known as "cattle hair." It is abundant in the twelve coastal counties of Shandong, as well as in the eight coastal counties of Liaoning and the four coastal counties of Hebei. In the first year of the Xuantong period of the late Qing Dynasty, when someone initiated the Shandong Agar-Agar Company in Qingdao, Sun Baoqi, the Governor of Shandong, approved its establishment and raised over 45,000 yuan in shares. The company was about to begin operations, but the Wuhan Uprising affected Shandong, and the matter was suspended. Later, someone initiated the company in Yantai in the first year of the Republic of China, but it split into two places, Qingdao and Yantai, due to disagreements among the organizers, and the attempt ultimately failed. At that time, Liang Daoyuan was one of the initiators. He believed that the seaweed raw material was the same as that produced in Japan, and the output was very abundant, but it was discarded on the ground, which was a pity. Therefore, he went to Japan to study manufacturing technology in order to make a comeback. Now, Mr. Liang has returned to China after completing his studies and has a great understanding of manufacturing technology. Recently, he obtained approval from the National Government in Nanjing to establish a agar-agar training institute in Shandong. He came to Jinan to consult with the provincial government on the implementation. All the members of the provincial government expressed their strong support and believed that it could be done. According to Mr. Liang's plan, a training institute will be established first, with two trainees from each of the twelve coastal counties entering the institute for training. In the future, a general sales office will be established in Qingdao, which is scheduled to open in March next year. It is estimated that if 10,000 catties are produced, a net profit of 10,000 yuan can be obtained. According to the planned plan, it will be gradually expanded, and in the third year, 600,000 catties can be produced, yielding a profit of 600,000 yuan, which can supply the whole country and recover the rights and interests. As for the fundraising method, it is planned that each of the twelve coastal counties will subscribe for 2,000 yuan (100 yuan per share), and the Qingdao and Yantai Chambers of Commerce will each subscribe for 2,000 yuan. The provincial government will also subscribe for 2,000 yuan as promotion, raising a total of 30,000 yuan. 10,000 yuan will be used to build a factory and purchase machinery, and 20,000 yuan will be used as working capital, which will always be operated jointly by the government and merchants. If this matter succeeds, it will also be a major promising industry in the province. (November 8th)"</p>
<h3 id="e59">Airplane Crashes During Test Flight in Guangdong <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Falling from a thousand feet in the sky, the pilot and mechanic drowned simultaneously. Guangzhou communication: The war in Guilin Province, Nanning, is still in a stalemate. The Aviation Department of the Eighth Route Army Headquarters, in order to increase its air force strength, specifically telegraphed the rear Aviation Department to allocate aircraft to the front for orders. The Aviation Department immediately prepared to send Yingde and Nanxiong aircraft to Wuzhou. Li Fengxuan, Director of the Aviation School's instructors, also volunteered to go. Mr. Li planned to practice flying before departing, so this morning (4th) at approximately 6:00 AM, he and mechanic Liu Quan piloted the German William-style No. 6 aircraft from Xiamen Aviation School for a test flight. The aircraft had two seats, one in the front and one in the back. Li, the pilot, was in the front seat driving, while mechanic Liu Quan sat in the back. Before the flight, they had prepared a sufficient amount of gasoline, intending for a long flight and to test the engine power. The test flight lasted about two hours. At 8:20 AM, the aircraft had soared into the clouds, about three thousand feet high. Mr. Li was skilled in piloting and had experience, so he was able to stay in the air for so long. Unexpectedly, when ascending into the misty clouds, the aircraft's engine was corroded by cold air, causing it to fail completely. At the same time, all the horsepower was lost, and the propeller stopped. The entire aircraft plunged towards the ground. Since the propeller could not be started, the pilot naturally could not control it and had to quickly fasten the belt around his body to the aircraft to prevent the aircraft from tilting and causing the person to fall. Therefore, as the aircraft tumbled and fell, the two men descended with the plane. About ten minutes after the accident, the aircraft had descended to about a thousand feet from the ground. Mr. Li used his skills to steer the falling aircraft towards the Dashatou airfield, hoping to accurately land in the airfield or be rescued by people in the field and be safe. At 8:30 AM, people at the airfield suddenly heard the aircraft's engine rattling in the air, different from the usual sound, and knew something was wrong. They quickly reported it to Director Huang Guangrui. Upon receiving the report, Director Huang immediately dispatched Deputy Adjutant Jian and Adjutant Yu Wenying to find a way to rescue them. Unexpectedly, in an instant, the No. 6 aircraft involved in the accident crashed into the river near the east corner of the airfield. The ships were terrified and lost color, initially not expecting the aircraft to crash. When the aircraft landed on the water surface, it unfortunately landed upside down. Li and Liu were pressed by the plane, and in the rush, they did not have time to remove the belts tied to the aircraft, causing their hands and feet to be unable to move freely. Even skilled swimmers could not escape the danger. The two men then suffocated and died in the water. It was said that if the two men had untied the belts fastened to the aircraft before going into the water, they might have been spared. When the aircraft crashed, rescuers from the Aviation Department had set out in small motorboats to salvage it from the river. At about 11:00 AM, they finally managed to hoist the No. 6 aircraft out of the water. Li and Liu's faces were gray, and officials spat blood. The death was very tragic. At that time, the two men's bodies were still firmly tied to the aircraft. The Aviation Department then untied the bodies of the two men and sent them to the Yueguang Funeral Company for preparation and notified the deceased's families to go to the funeral. At the same time, it was reported to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters for assistance in accordance with the regulations for those who died in the line of duty, and separate compensation was given. It was found that Mr. Li was from Fuzhou, Fujian Province, 38 years old. He graduated from the American Aviation School and returned to China to serve as a flying instructor at the Xiamen Aviation School. The school recently suspended operations due to funding shortages. The personnel of the school switched to the Guangdong Aviation Department. Mr. Li excelled in technology and is currently the Principal Instructor at the Guangdong Air School. Liu was 36 years old, from Panyu. He joined the Aviation Department in 1921 and was proficient in mechanics. Now, the two men have unexpectedly encountered an accident at the same time, and the talent in aviation has been weakened by two more people. (Evening of November 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Communist Suspect Case Occurs in Jilin <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The principal of the provincial No. 5 middle school was arrested, and the students were dismissed. Jilin Communication: At noon on the 30th of last month, more than 50 students from the Provincial No. 5 Middle School in Dongjuzi Street, the provincial capital, lined up and entered the city to report to Commander Xi Dai (Qia) of the Border Defense Department about communist elements within the school, requesting strict handling. Xi happened to be working at the Army Training Center at the time and immediately received them, instructing them to return to the school and wait for instructions. He immediately sent Provincial Government Secretary Zhao Rumei to lead soldiers to search the school and ordered the military police to closely monitor the situation. As a result, two large boxes of books considered to be suspected of communism were found. Xi immediately sent Secretary Zhao to Shenyang to report to Zhang Zuoxiang and ask for instructions. However, according to the school authorities, this matter was caused by six or seven unruly students who failed the exam and had to repeat the grade. These students thought that they would inevitably have to leave the school, so they spared no effort to destroy the school in every possible way. In addition, they were incited by the dismissed art teacher Zhu Yishi, so they falsely accused the school in the name of the Communist Party to vent personal grievances and destroy the school. The school has a total of more than 400 students. Except for the above-mentioned group, the rest are still attending classes as usual. Since then, the students who reported the case and the students who protected the school have issued declarations attacking each other. People generally thought that school turmoil was commonplace, and the suspicion of communism was not yet confirmed, so few people paid attention to it. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, the reported Principal Xiao Bofu and Dean of Academics Xie Yutian and a dozen other people were suddenly arrested. It is said that after Zhang Zuoxiang received Secretary Zhao's report, he believed that in the current situation of rampant communist disasters, even if there was only suspicion, the truth should be thoroughly investigated. Therefore, he telegraphed Xi to thoroughly investigate the matter. Secretary Zhao also returned to the province to report, and the authorities ordered the military police monitoring the school not to allow teachers and students in the school to move freely. The arrested people were secretly interrogated at the Border Defense Department's military court the day before yesterday and are still detained in the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital. To this day, the authorities have not announced the content of the case. The students in the school, upon hearing the news of the arrest of the principal and others, gathered on the evening of the 3rd to discuss ways to rescue them. After the police detected this, they reported it to Xi, who telegraphed the Guard Regiment on the morning of the 4th to send a battalion of soldiers to suppress them. The military, police, and police jointly sent all the students in the school home in batches and ordered their parents to sign guarantees that they would not go out and cause trouble.

<p>boarders are still under strict surveillance by the military police and are not allowed to leave the school. As a result, the school has completely come to a standstill. The Education Department believes that the school cannot be without someone in charge, so it has appointed Dong Xianqiao, the school's director of affairs and Chinese teacher, to serve as acting principal. However, he cannot perform his duties and is only responsible for safekeeping. It is said that the authorities have criticized Education Department Director Wang Xinlin, a relative of Principal Xiao, and Wang is uneasy and has been acting passively in recent days, with talk of resigning.

<h3 id="e61">The Secret of the Russian Consulate's New House in Harbin <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Three-story building with a basement built with trenches. Doors and windows are equipped with iron gates, and the conference room has an underground passage.</p>
<p>Harbin Communication: The Russian Consulate in Harbin was originally renting a private house at No. 7 Jilin Street, Qinjiagang. After being searched by our side once on May 27 last year, the secret of its construction has been made public. In early spring this year, Consul General Melinikov requested the China Eastern Railway to allocate a new building for the consulate. His reason was that Chinese non-railway-related institutions, such as the special zone land bureau and local courts, all used official China Eastern Railway houses, and the Russian consulate should not be an exception. At that time, he also requested the allocation of the residence that Ma Zhongjun (Director of the Heilongjiang Foreign Affairs Bureau) sold to the Railway Bureau for the consulate's use. Mo Dehui did not allow it. After repeated requests, the old building of the Eastern Railway Library was allocated to the consulate. In late October, the Russian Consulate moved to the new site. However, before the relocation, the Eastern Railway Bureau actually appropriated a huge sum of one million rubles (equivalent to 2 million Shanghai taels) without the approval of the board of directors to build a new house for the Russian Consulate. The address is behind the new consulate site. Few Chinese railway employees knew about its engineering plan, and many Russian employees in the engineering department did not know the details. Construction has been underway for nearly three months, and more than half of the three-story building has been completed. The date of completion should not be far away. The highest authorities of the special zone once sent personnel to investigate the construction content of the new house. However, when they arrived at the construction site, they were refused entry by the Russian supervisor. They secretly inquired with the Chinese workers. Although there were dozens of Chinese workers, they all said that they only received wages every day or did some insignificant work outside the construction area. They were not allowed to enter the interior, and they did not know what the structure was like. After the authorities received the report, they became more suspicious, so they sent many secret agents to search for the blueprints of the house. A copy of the blueprints was obtained until recently, but it was only a partial sketch. The entire blueprints could not be obtained. However, the works recorded in this partial blueprint are enough to make people stunned, and the secrets of the entire project are far more than several times that. According to the blueprints, the building has three floors and one basement. The walls are four feet thick, and the stone foundation is fifteen feet. The windows and doors have iron gates that are five inches thick. Each window is equipped with an ordinary cannonball that cannot be destroyed. The basement windows are two feet above the ground and are separated by iron plates. The windowsill is wide enough to place a small cannon or a machine gun. There is a live gun eye inside that can see outwards. Two new-style trench-covering ditches are built inside the windowsill, which are long and surround the entire building. The top is covered with steel plates, and more than a hundred armed soldiers can be ambushed at the same time. The entrance and exit of the basement is in the Consul General's office. An underground passage from the Consul General's office can lead to the conference room. The room can accommodate 200 people. The lights and candles are installed in the walls, and the tables and chairs are not visible on weekdays. In case of emergency, the mechanism can be twisted to make them appear in rows. Behind the conference room, there is an underground passage on the wall that leads to the car room in the backyard. The car room can accommodate more than a dozen cars. The Consul General's and Deputy Consul General's offices each have a secret room, which can be used to store documents and also has criminal machinery. In addition to the obvious doors and windows, each room inside has a secret door that can be connected. In addition, there are various agencies because the original drawings are in Russian and the translated names have not been determined. Generally, they are nothing more than mechanical equipment. The new house of the Russian Consulate has this secret. Its intention is not difficult to guess. The current authorities have sent the blueprints along with the drawings to the Northeast authorities.

The First Chuan Branch of the Water Police went to pursue them, but the bandits had already fled. Gansu Reviews Counter-Revolution Case: Ganyu County gentleman Wang Zuoliang was accused by the people of the county to the Nanjing Special Court in 1928, saying that Wang colluded with Zhang Zongchang to provide military funds of 480,000 yuan and other counter-revolutionary acts. He was arrested and interrogated. Later, because the Special Court was abolished, Wang Zuoliang and the entire case files were transferred to the Supreme Court. Last year, the Supreme Court issued the case to the Jiangsu Higher Court for trial. In December last year, the court ruled that the evidence was insufficient and declared him innocent. At that time, the original prosecutor Jin Henian refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the Supreme Court. Wang Zuoliang submitted a written guarantee in the summer of this year and was released on bail of 11,000 yuan to await trial. Now, the Supreme Court has sent the case back to the Higher Court for retrial. Yesterday (10th) afternoon, Lin Dawen, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Higher Court, tried the case. Wang Zuoliang hired lawyer Cai Nipei to appear in court to defend him.</p>

Conflict over Increased Wages in the Incense Industry: Disputes between labor and management in the incense industry in this county have been frequent. Recently, the labor side demanded a 20% increase in wages from the management side due to the increasing cost of living. The county party and government meetings repeatedly convened mediation meetings. The management side refused to increase wages due to the sharp decline in business in various stores, resulting in a breakdown in negotiations and a conflict. The labor representatives Shi Chongxun and others sent the management representative Xie Xigui to the County Public Security Bureau for legal relief. Yesterday, Bao Tiyu, a member of the Third Section, opened a court to interrogate the reasons of the labor and management sides, but he could not judge because each held its own ground. He ordered them to be sent to the county for trial.

At first, all the prisoners requested bail, but none were granted. The prisoners were treated well in custody, and there were several other county magistrates, public security directors, and trial officials who were detained for other cases, so Zheng Chengyuan and others should not worry about being lonely. Implementation of Joint Defense Plan in Various Counties: In order to fundamentally eliminate banditry in various counties, the Civil Affairs Department has specially drafted joint defense measures for various counties, regardless of provincial and county water and land boundaries, to achieve the goal of jointly encircling and suppressing bandits. In addition to Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Danyang, Jurong, and Zhenyangzhong, which are included in the provincial guard area, the remaining counties are divided into fifteen districts.

<p>Two County Magistrates Join Forces to Suppress the Luyang Bandits</p>
<p>The Luyang Lake between Youyang and Kunjing has always been an area where bandits appear. The police teams of Youyang counties previously suppressed and dispersed them. However, recently, a large number of bandits have fled from Yancheng and occupied the area. Villages near the region are harmed every day. Wealthy households have moved to the city one after another. It is heard that County Magistrate Wang of this county is scheduled to lead a team at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow (the 9th) to join forces with County Magistrate Chen of Yangzhou and District Chief Cheng of the 6th District of the Provincial Water Police Team stationed in Youzhou to fiercely suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Robbery of a Ship Suspected to Be a Misunderstanding</p>
<p>The 2nd Squad of the Water Police Team stationed in Shaobo previously arrested the ship robbery bandits Wang Zanshan and Chen Guilin, as well as three suspects, at the Chunyuan Teahouse in the town. They were immediately sent along with witnesses Chen Wenyuan and Jiang Huailiang to the headquarters of the 23rd Team stationed in Wantou Town, Yangzhou. The three suspects were released on bail by the Shaobo Chamber of Commerce. The two bandits Wang and Chen and the witnesses were transferred to the district headquarters for handling on the evening of the 4th. That night, Inspector Zhao interrogated the bandits, who consistently denied having robbed the ship. He then sent Inspector Wang Baoqing to Chenjia Village, Shaobo, for investigation. Last night, Inspector Wang returned to the district headquarters and reported that the two bandits were indeed law-abiding citizens. Wang Baoshan is a blacksmith working in other ports and recently returned to get married. Chen Guilin usually opens a steel shop in Shanghai and recently returned to his hometown to visit his relatives. Both of them were eating tea at the Chunyuan Teahouse in Shaobo. District Chief Cheng considered the matter to be of great importance and transferred the two bandits and the witnesses to the Yangzhou Court for interrogation. A widowed daughter-in-law surnamed Yuan was kidnapped. The daughter-in-law of Yuan Wanshan, a farmer in Yuanjia Village under the jurisdiction of the county, had been avoiding bandits outside for many days. Yesterday, she returned home for business. The bandits learned of this and within only two hours of her arrival, eight bandits suddenly came and kidnapped her to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>The Silk Industry Suddenly Declines</p>
<p>The sales of the Hangzhou silk industry gradually increased after the end of the military operations, and the price of goods also increased. However, recently, it has suddenly declined. The reason for this is that the end of the national calendar year is approaching, and the deadline for settlement is imminent. All the farms did not dare to indiscriminately collect goods, and the same situation exists for the customer gangs. Sales are consequently sluggish. Strictly Prohibit Disturbing the People in the Name of Enlistment</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Provincial Bandit Suppression Headquarters issued a notice to all subordinate areas strictly prohibiting the practice of disturbing the people in the name of enlistment. If any such cases are discovered again, they should be immediately arrested to ensure local stability. It is difficult to stop the collection of religious donation taxes. Those in Zhejiang Province who collect religious donation taxes to fund education have used them for construction and public welfare expenses. This time, the Ministry of the Interior requested that the collection be stopped. The Provincial Government believes that this donation tax has been in place for a long time, and chanting scriptures and worshiping are the responsibilities of wealthy families. Taking it from the people and using it for the people is difficult to stop. Yesterday, a special request was submitted to the Executive Yuan, enumerating the various reasons why the abolition of local funds would inevitably lead to budgetary deficits and affect the undertaking of public works. Please postpone the suspension of the educational message.</p>

<p>Harbin Dispatch: The Heilongjiang Provincial Government is seeking to develop the current state of education in the province and has stipulated a plan to increase the number of middle schools in each county. The first step is to add eleven junior middle schools for boys and four junior middle schools for girls within five years. Among them, in addition to the restoration of the First Girls' Middle School in the provincial capital, the other counties where schools will be established are as follows: (1) One boys' middle school and one girls' middle school will be established in Hailar. (2) One boys' middle school will be established in Nehe. (3) One boys' middle school and one girls' middle school will be established in Deli. (4) One boys' middle school will be established in Tangyuan. (5) One boys' middle school will be established in Zhaozhou. (6) One boys' middle school will be established in Baiquan. (7) One boys' middle school will be established in Tuiyi. (8) One boys' middle school will be established in Manzhouli. (9) One boys' middle school will be established in Mohe. (10) One boys' middle school will be established in Wuyun. (11) One boys' middle school will be established in Solun. (12) One girls' middle school will be established in Suihua. If county middle schools have already been established in the above-mentioned areas, they will be expanded and transformed into provincial schools based on their original foundation. All original funds of the county middle schools will be transferred to the province to offset the insufficient amount, which will be borne by the provincial treasury. The second step is to continue adding primary and secondary schools in Shizhang, Qigan, Huma, Kete, Luobei, and Suidong year by year within five to ten years to popularize education.</p>

<p>Yu Youren, the new president of China Public School, arrived at the school to inspect the situation yesterday (the 10th) at 3 p.m. Posters with slogans such as "Welcome Party-State Elder Yu, the President," "Welcome Central Committee Member Yu, the President," "Welcome the Founder of Our School, Yu, the President," "Welcome President Yu to Purge Reactionary Elements," "Down with the Communist Party," "Down with the Statist Faction," "Down with the Reorganization Faction," "Long Live the Chinese Kuomintang," and "Long Live China Public School" were pasted all over the school. When Mr. Yu's car arrived near the Paotaiwan Station, the welcoming delegation set off firecrackers to welcome him. The entire student body gathered at the large playground, and Mr. Yu immediately took the stage to deliver an admonishment, which stated roughly: I have come to the school today to maintain school affairs, not to assume office. I am here at the repeated urging of the school affairs council and the students, and seeing that the school has fallen into a state of anarchy and the students' studies have been completely suspended, I could not bear it, so I came to the school to maintain order. You should abide by the resolutions of the board of directors. Before the board of directors appoints another successor, I will be fully responsible. If you have any opinions, you can send one or two representatives to speak, but the number of people should not be too large, and there is no need to organize a delegation. Mr. Ma has resigned. The board of directors has not resolved to ask him to return to the school, and he will not come back. In short, all matters must be resolved by the board of directors. Now, you must concentrate on your studies and not act like children. Supporting someone and overthrowing someone is all nonsense. I will soon have to go to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. You must not act rashly, etc. There was thunderous applause throughout the speech.</p>
<p>Another News Item</p>
<p>Since President Ma Junwu of China Public School in Wusong resigned and went to Japan, and Yu Youren was elected as president, the students have been divided into two factions: one is the delegation, and the other is the League. Yesterday morning, the delegation side, because the board of directors had elected Yu Youren as the president of Zhonggong, and Mr. Yu was scheduled to come to the school at 2 p.m. on the 10th to take office, the students held an emergency meeting to strike first to show their rejection and issued various slogans such as vowing to support President Ma's return to the school. At the same time, the League side also posted various slogans on top of the delegation's slogans, causing a conflict between the two factions. Yang Fanrong, the chief of the 7th District, learned of this and immediately supervised Inspector Dai Guosheng and Yulong, along with eight police officers, to rush to suppress the situation. At 3 p.m., Mr. Yu, wearing a gray silk robe and carrying a cane, arrived at the school by car. When Mr. Yu had just entered the school gate, a large number of students from the delegation side shouted to support President Ma, and some people shouted to overthrow Secretary Ding Guyin, causing the order to be extremely chaotic and indescribable. Later, after Mr. Yu rested for a while, he stood high in the school's gateball field and declared to the public that he had not come to take over as president, nor had he ever been president, and that he wanted to go to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, so he had no time to be president. He had come to Songjiang on the entrustment of President Cai of the board of directors and Hu Shih to temporarily maintain order, etc. He also advised the students to abide by the school rules and to prioritize their studies so as not to waste their precious time. After speaking, he got into the car and returned to Shanghai. It is heard that Ma Junwu will probably arrive in Shanghai today. It is also learned that Yu Youren, at the repeated urging of the board of directors, faculty, and students of China Public School, went to the school at 3 p.m. yesterday to announce his intention to temporarily maintain order. When Mr. Yu's car passed Jiangwan, a small number of people held a meeting inside the school to disrupt the school, and military police were requested to maintain order. He immediately sent someone to order the military police to withdraw, otherwise, he would not go to the school. After the military police withdrew, the students welcomed Mr. Yu into the president's office to handle affairs. Because there were too many listeners, the auditorium was not big enough, so the meeting was changed to an open-air meeting in the sports field. Mr. Yu's speech mainly covered: (1) The board of directors elected me as president this time, but I am sick and have too many things to do, so I have repeatedly declined. (2) The chairman of the board of directors repeatedly urged me, because the school is in a state of disorder, and the various problems are getting bigger and more complicated, and because Mr. Cai and I are going to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the board of directors cannot convene the school and no one is responsible, fearing that it will delay the students' studies. I had no choice but to come to the school today to maintain order, but I am not here to take office, but to temporarily maintain order. (3) The various major problems in the school will be resolved by the board of directors. Students should serve the board of directors' resolutions and should start attending classes as usual. (4) I still hope that the board of directors will elect someone else. Mr. Hu Shih advised me to wait for Mr. Ma Junwu to return to the school together before taking office. I am not here to take office, so why wait for Mr. Ma? Before Mr. Yu took the stage, a small number of restless students hoped to disrupt the meeting, but when Mr. Yu spoke, the whole audience was convinced and dispersed with cheers.</p>

<p>Denies Professor Strike, Opposes Secretariat Spreading Rumors, News from the Executive Committee of the Student Union of Lada Agricultural College</p>
<p>Although all the students of Lada Agricultural College have actively expressed their opposition to the recent corrupt situation of the school council under the control of Peng Xiang, the director of the secretariat of the school, and Cheng Gan Yun, the director of general affairs, they are still working hard as before in their studies and physical labor. Recently, because of the preparations for the chrysanthemum festival, all the students in the college were happily engaged in the work. However, the secretariat of the school spread rumors and falsely published news in various newspapers about the professors of Lada Agricultural College going on strike. It was found that the professors of the college, except for department heads Chen Guorong and Wu Shuge, and Professor Fang Cheng, who were expelled by the students a few weeks ago due to their shallow scholarship and various other reasons and could not come to the school, and two or three professors who had formally asked the college for leave of absence for teaching, all taught as usual. Therefore, after the news came out, all the students in the college were surprised. Now, the entire student body of the college has resolved in a general meeting to unanimously declare to the outside world that the rumors are false and to publicly deny the professors' strike, to oppose the secretariat's spreading of rumors, and to publicly warn Fang Cheng, Wu Shuge, and Chen Guorong, who fabricated rumors and harmed the school.</p>

The current president of the college is trying to maintain order helplessly while submitting his resignation to the board of directors, which has not yet been approved.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Joint Research Association for Elementary Teaching <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Dong Renjian Speaks on How to Use Textbooks</p>
<p>The Joint Research Association for Elementary Teaching in this city held its thirteenth regular meeting at He'an Primary School on the 8th.

The meeting was held at 2:00 p.m., with Qian Xuanqing presiding and Chen Shuying recording the minutes. After the chairman's report, Mr. Dong Renjian was invited to speak on how to use textbooks. He said that to study this problem, we must first understand the advantages and disadvantages of using textbooks. Regarding the advantages: (1) Using textbooks makes teaching easy to learn. (2) Textbooks have a well-organized curriculum. (3) Using textbooks makes each level more complete. Regarding the disadvantages: (1) It cannot take into account the different abilities of children in the whole grade and has no flexibility. (2) The teaching materials often do not conform to the differences in children's personalities, local differences, and differences of the times. (3) Editors often have prejudices. (4) Due to psychological effects, it is not easy to find errors in textbooks. (5) Textbooks include too little. (6) It is easy to mistakenly regard textbooks as the gospel, which shackles thought and makes it difficult to be independent. If so, how should we use textbooks? (1) First, we must understand the book, such as the publishing house, the name of the editor, the publication date, whether it has been reviewed, and the table of contents, etc. must be recognized first. (2) Pay attention to the children's learning process, first arouse the motivation to read, then let them read quickly, but not carefully, then read slowly, and then practice repeatedly. (3) Use the textbook as a method to initiate discussion and solve problems. (4) Use the textbook as a guide for work. (5) Use the textbook as a supplementary reading material. Then, he explained in detail how to use reference books, etc. After the speech, there was a discussion. (A) A discussion on how to deal with the report of examples of elementary national arithmetic teaching received. As a result, those already received will be mimeographed by the original school and distributed to each school for reference. Those not received will continue to be collected and processed at the next regular meeting. (B) A discussion on how to formulate a perfect elementary children's self-government organization and implementation methods to increase educational efficiency. Shangzhong Experimental Primary School supplemented the reasons and methods. As a result, first collect materials (including children's lives and the good habits they need), organize them, and then distribute them to each school for reference, and nominate Shangzhong Experimental Primary School to preside over and other schools to assist in collecting materials. (C) A discussion on how to guide low-grade children to read. As a result, Longde First Experimental Primary School was nominated and other schools assisted in collecting materials (refer to Mr. Dong Renjian's speech). (D) A discussion on the school on duty for the next regular meeting. Yucai Primary School was nominated. The discussion adjourned at 6:00 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Chairman Chiang and Wife Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday on Their Way Back to Beijing <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Naval Guns Fired, Security Along the Way Was Tight</p>
<p>Received Yu Youren, Li Shizeng, Sun Hongyi, and Others in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the National Government, accompanied by his wife, Madam Soong Mei-ling, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon from Ningbo aboard the Lianjing warship, and took the 11 PM night train back to Beijing that evening. He met with Vice Commander Zhang, received French Ambassador Wilden, and attended the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. A detailed account of yesterday's events in Shanghai is provided below:</p>
<p>Kong Xiangxi Accompanied Chairman Chiang and his wife departed from their ancestral home in Fenghua at 6:30 PM on the 9th, arriving in Ningbo at 8:50 PM. They then boarded the Lianjing warship, dispatched by the Navy, and sailed to Shanghai. Those accompanying them included Kong Xiangxi and his wife and children, Wang Shihe, the chief of security, and Jiang Fushou, the adjutant, totaling more than ten people. Secretary Gao Lingbai had already gone to Beijing earlier. Zhu Peide had already returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yongjian Warship Did Not Arrive According to Wang Shihe's statement to this newspaper's reporter yesterday, the Yongjian warship was originally responsible for escorting the Lianjing, sailing ahead. However, when it arrived at Zhenhai, its rudder tail was suddenly damaged and it had to return for repairs. There was a slight wind and waves in the evening, which reduced the speed of the Lianjing. Chairman Chiang originally intended to arrive in Wusong at 5:00 or 6:00 AM, stay in Shanghai, and then proceed to Nanjing. Unexpectedly, it did not arrive until 12:00 noon, so the plan was changed.</p>
<p>A Seven-Hour Wait Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui received a message the night before that Chairman Chiang would land at Gaochangmiao. Yesterday morning around 5:00 AM, he dispatched a team of detectives from the command headquarters to guard the Gaochangmiao naval dock. Xiong himself also rushed to welcome him at 6:00 AM, but waited until 9:00 AM without seeing any sign of him. Finally, he was informed by the Wusong garrison that everyone had moved to Wusong to welcome him. Cars from both the Chiang and Kong residences had driven to Wusong at 4:00 AM yesterday morning to welcome them. Various key members of the Navy Department also arrived at the Wusong dock around 5:00 AM. The Lianjing warship did not arrive until 12:00 noon. The welcoming party waited for seven hours.</p>
<p>Tight Security After 9:00 AM yesterday morning, there was still no news of the Lianjing warship arriving in Song, but more and more people who had heard the news came to welcome him. These included Xiong Shihui, Yuan Liang, Chen Xunyong, the commander of the naval training fleet, Wu Zhennan, the head of the coastal defense, Jiang Bin, the commander of the Wusong fortress, and dozens of reporters from various newspapers. Near the Wusong naval dock, the Second Battalion of the 27th Regiment of the 5th Division stationed in Song was responsible for security and defense. The entire vehicle patrol team of the Public Security Bureau and armed police officers from the command headquarters assisted, making the situation quite serious.</p>
<p>Twenty-One Gun Salute It wasn't until after 11:00 AM yesterday morning that the white smoke of the Lianjing warship was seen. At 11:45 AM, the ship arrived at the mouth of Wusong. Navy Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan happened to be returning to Shanghai aboard the Chuyou warship after a maneuver. The Lianjing warship stopped slightly outside the mouth of the river. Chen went aboard to pay his respects, and the Chuyou warship fired a 21-gun salute to express its welcome. At 12:15 PM, the Lianjing warship arrived at the naval dock. Chiang and others boarded small gasoline-powered boats to come ashore. At 12:30 PM, they landed. The entire Lianjing warship was painted white and fully decorated with national flags. When Chairman Chiang and his wife disembarked from the small boat, the Lianjing warship also fired a 21-gun salute in tribute. The sound of cannons echoed loudly, shaking the eardrums.</p>
<p>Received Yu Youren After landing, Chairman Chiang and his wife took separate cars to the Kong residence for lunch. They then went to a private residence on Gallier Road to rest. Yang Hu, Wu Zhihao, and others came to pay their respects, but they were not received. Around 4:00 PM, Chairman Chiang and his wife went to get their teeth done on Great Britain Road, and then visited the tomb of Madam Soong's father in the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road. At 5:30 PM, they returned to the Soong residence on Seymour Road. They then summoned Yu Youren, Li Shizeng, and Sun Hongyi to discuss important official matters. In the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by Kong Xiangxi and his wife, with Huang Jinrong, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and others as guests. At 9:30 PM, they went out for a drive. At 10:45 PM, they arrived at the North Station.</p>
<p>Took a Special Train to Beijing Last night at 11:00 PM, Chairman Chiang and his wife took a special train to Beijing. The area around the station was secured in advance by a company of soldiers from the 27th Regiment, dispatched by the Shanghai-Wusong Garrison Command. The Public Security Bureau also dispatched armed police and soldiers from the 48th Division to assist in maintaining order. Those who went to the station to see them off included Kong Xiangxi and his wife, Xiong Shihui, Chu Qiaqing, Chen Xizeng, Zhou Peizhen, Song Ziliang, and others. Chiang Yi, the deputy director of the command headquarters, and the head of the detective team also arrived at the station to direct operations. Chairman Chiang and his wife rode in a PCA&amp;T Pullman car. When Chiang and others arrived at the station, the Public Security Bureau's military band played music to welcome them. After Chiang boarded the train, he took off his hat on the train and thanked the welcoming party.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengtin and Others Traveled Together Chairman Chiang's train was a special train, leaving fifteen minutes before the overnight express train. There were a total of four Pullman cars and four sleeping cars on the train. In addition to the Pullman car occupied by Chairman Chiang and his wife, those traveling to Beijing on the same train included Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting in Pullman car No. 14, Zhejiang Provincial Government Chairman Zhang Jingjiang in Pullman car No. 12, and Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Chen Mingshu in Pullman car No. 2. Li Shizeng, Dai Jitao, Chen Ce, Wang Jiazhen, Zheng Hongnian, and Zhang Shouchong were in the sleeping cars.</p>
<p>Vice Commander Arriving in Beijing According to Vice Minister Wang Jiazhen, Vice Commander Zhang is expected to arrive in Beijing at 11:00 AM tomorrow (the 11th). Therefore, Chairman Chiang and others hurriedly left Shanghai last night to go to Beijing to welcome Vice Commander Zhang. Vice Commander Zhang will stay in Beijing for a short time and then return to Peiping and Tianjin to handle the aftermath of the North, and may not have time to visit Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Prohibition of Spring Festival Holiday <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate and prevent reported resolutions by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association to designate February 17th and 18th as a two-day holiday for all industries during the Spring Festival. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, citing that the resolution contradicts Article 1 of the Central Executive Committee's regulations promoting the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, suspects the report is inaccurate. It has ordered the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to investigate and prevent this. The official order is recorded below:</p>
<p>Order to comply: It is hereby noted that according to today's newspaper, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Bankers' Association have resolved to abolish the lunar calendar in accordance with the National Government's order, designating February 17th and 18th as a two-day Spring Festival holiday, and January 1st to 3rd as the New Year holiday, along with Sunday the 4th, for a total of four days. In order to facilitate coordination, foreign banks have also decided to follow this arrangement for both the Gregorian calendar and abolished lunar New Year holidays. However, Article 1 of the Central Executive Committee's regulations promoting the adoption of the Gregorian calendar stipulates that the holiday dates and various rituals and entertainment associated with the abolished lunar New Year should be moved to around the Gregorian calendar New Year, and that no holidays are permitted during the abolished lunar New Year, nor may holidays be taken under other pretexts. This has been ordered by the Executive Yuan to all provincial and municipal governments for compliance, and this bureau has relayed the order for compliance and jointly announced it with the Municipal Party Department and the Public Safety Bureau, requiring all citizens to comply. The name "Spring Festival" has long been eliminated, and it is not included in the Central Government's designated commemorative events. If February 17th and 18th are arbitrarily designated as a Spring Festival holiday, it would inevitably perpetuate the use of the abolished lunar calendar and hinder the promotion of the Gregorian calendar. It must be understood that Shanghai is the focus of attention for the national business community, and the Chamber of Commerce is the leader of the commercial groups, and the Bankers' Association is the model for all industries. It is unlikely that they would deliberately violate government orders. This bureau sincerely hopes that the newspaper report is not factual, so as not to damage the reputation of the association. However, since it has been reported, you are instructed to investigate, send a letter to correct the report, so as to avoid confusion, and notify the business community to prepare for year-end closing of accounts and New Year's customs and rituals as early as possible, so that they are held at the end of this Gregorian calendar year and the coming New Year, and not continue to follow the abolished lunar calendar. This is of utmost importance. This order is issued.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Wang Yansong Reports on the Progress of the Industry and Commerce Conference <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Industry regulations case handed over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption and implementation. Closing accounts and collecting debts are two separate issues. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen yesterday and invited Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong to report on the progress of the Industry and Commerce Conference and important issues such as industry regulations, Gregorian calendar closing of accounts, etc. More than 240 representatives from over 50 industry associations and 51 members of the Chamber of Commerce staff attended. Chairman Cheng Bian presided over the ceremony. After Secretary-General Ru Chengqing reported on important meetings of the past week, Standing Committee Member Wang Yansong gave a report, stating that the purpose of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce convening the Industry and Commerce Conference was to vigorously implement the Party's industry and commerce policies, promote the development of national production, increase foreign trade, and enhance the national economy. It was hoped to gather the talents and abilities of officials and businessmen from across the country and collect the benefits of diverse opinions. Therefore, the participants in this conference included representatives serving in industry and commerce administrative agencies, leaders of the business community, experts studying economic theories, and representatives from as far as Sichuan, Guangdong, Liaoning, Ningxia, and overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, all gathered together. The number of proposals was numerous. Not counting the temporary motions, there were a total of 406 proposals. If these 406 proposals had to be discussed one by one, even if the Industry and Commerce Conference was extended from eight days to one or two months, it would still be difficult to achieve. Therefore, after receiving the proposals, six review committees were organized to sort, classify, analyze, and study the proposals according to their nature. The first group reviewed matters concerning industry and commerce policies and administrative regulations. The second group reviewed matters concerning international trade and transportation. The third group reviewed matters concerning labor, labor disputes, and scientific management. The fourth group reviewed matters concerning industry and commerce finance and taxation. The fifth group reviewed matters concerning the development of industry and promotion, protection, and improvement of domestic goods. The sixth group reviewed matters concerning national unemployment and industry and commerce relief and other matters. After each group reviewed the proposals and drafted a review report, it was submitted to the conference for discussion. The results of the conference discussions can be divided into ten categories: (1) matters concerning resisting economic aggression; (2) matters concerning joint operations; (3) matters concerning reorganizing tariff regulations; (4) matters concerning improving the currency system; (5) matters concerning scientific management methods and industrial rationalization; (6) matters concerning basic industries; (7) matters concerning indigenous industries; (8) matters concerning labor welfare; (9) matters concerning unemployment issues; and (10) matters concerning international trade. Each of the above ten categories had resolutions passed. A detailed report is not possible due to time constraints. Therefore, I will only report on the four issues that are of most concern to the various industries: (1) implementing methods of labor-management cooperation. This proposal was submitted by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and was passed in its original form after the first review. However, when it was submitted to the conference, members paid close attention, and detailed and thorough statements were made by all parties. As a result of the discussion, it was returned to the review committee. After the second review, the phrase "the management rights of the factory are the inherent rights of the factory" was added, and other amendments were made to the original proposal before it was passed by the conference. (2) The case of industries complying with industry regulations. The proposal that industries should uniformly comply with industry regulations approved by the competent authorities was proposed by Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and was the issue of greatest concern to the various industry associations in this city. According to the nature of this proposal, it should have belonged to the first review. The result of the review was "submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for reference." After being submitted to the conference, the Shanghai industry and commerce representatives present believed that this case had previously been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and if it was still submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for reference, there would inevitably be little result. Therefore, they unanimously opposed it and explained the reasons in detail. As a result of the discussion, it was returned to the review committee. The result of the second review was "requesting the Judicial Yuan to interpret it." When it was submitted to the conference, the situation was very tense because it was already the sixth day of the conference, and many of the industry and commerce representatives from Shanghai and other places had already left Beijing. Therefore, there were fewer people speaking for the business community. In addition, representatives serving in industry and commerce administrative agencies inevitably expressed sympathy for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's position. Economic and legal experts, on the one hand, were not familiar with business conditions and customs, and on the other hand, felt that the case had no legal basis and did not generate legal interest, so they felt indifferent to the case. But since the situation at the meeting was such, and we remembered the earnest expectations and heavy trust of the various industries, if the case had no results, we would have no way to face all the industries in the city. Therefore, we had to work hard to persevere. It was estimated that the Judicial Yuan's interpretation was limited to laws that had such clauses but the meaning was not very clear. Since there was no such legal text in this case, it could not be requested for interpretation. Those with legal texts should follow the legal texts, and those without legal texts should follow customs. This is a principle recognized by legal scholars. If the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce receives a letter from the court requesting an investigation of customs, the court will also rely on the Chamber of Commerce's investigation and response as the basis for its judgment. It can be seen that customs has its own strong position in law. Now that there are thousands of years of customary law for industries to comply with industry regulations, and there is no explicit provision in the law, it should be handled in accordance with customs. After we stated this opinion, the atmosphere at the meeting changed. Unexpectedly, a representative from Northeast China proposed that the case of industries complying with industry regulations could not be implemented in the north, otherwise the industry associations would be suspected of manipulation and oppression. At that time, I also explained in detail the organizational laws of industry associations and chambers of commerce, saying that the staff of the associations are elected by the industries, and the staff of the chambers of commerce are elected by the industry associations. Since the industries trust them when they are elected, they can be removed according to law after they are elected. How can there be manipulation and oppression? Moreover, the industry regulations that industries should comply with are limited to those approved by the government, so the government is responsible for supervision and review, and there is no need to worry about manipulation and oppression. At that time, the original proposer, Director Pan Gongzhan, also gave a very detailed explanation, saying that if there are no industry regulations that industries should comply with, the industry associations will inevitably disintegrate, and the foundation of the Chamber of Commerce will be shaken. If members of industry associations have to pay membership fees and raise public bonds at any time, and the industry regulations do not have to be complied with, then members only have obligations and no rights. Why should there be such industry associations? Not only this, but if the industry regulations do not have to be complied with, the financial market will inevitably be chaotic. For example, if the business hours of the money industry and the silver market are as standardized, what will be the impact on society? At that time, the members at the meeting suddenly realized after this explanation. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to "hand it over to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption and implementation." It cannot be said that this result in the Industry and Commerce Conference was not due to the representatives' hard work. However, it is hoped that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will be able to comply with commercial sentiment, respect the resolutions, and promptly adopt and implement them, so that the industry can be protected. (3) Gregorian calendar closing date. This proposal was submitted for discussion by the chambers of commerce of various counties in Jiangsu. Minister Kong happened to be the chairman at the time. Minister Kong made some explanations on this proposal, saying that the government has the determination to follow the Gregorian calendar, and it may be difficult to request a change. However, this seat believes that closing accounts is one issue, and collecting debts is another issue. It is not necessary to collect debts after closing accounts. In the future, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce may issue an order stating that the business community should close accounts at the end of the Gregorian calendar year, but collecting debts can be done at the end of January or the end of February. In this way, those who pay the bills will not be able to use it as an excuse to delay, and there will be no violation of national government orders or business conditions. Since the members of the conference did not discuss the chairman's report, the proposal had no results or resolutions. (4) The case of joint operation with joint liability. The Civil Law regulates that joint operation with joint liability occurs suddenly. It is requested that supplementary clauses be discussed and approved and transferred to the Legislative Yuan for supplementary relief. This case was proposed by the Sichuan representative. After the representative's explanation, the members of the conference believed that it was worth discussing. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to "ask the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to draft measures and submit them to the Legislative Yuan for adoption." The above four cases are reported because they are closely related to the business community and are not afraid of being tedious. However, since the nature of the Industry and Commerce Conference is not a legally established power organ, the resolutions must be effectively adopted and implemented by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in order to achieve the effectiveness of the conference. Therefore, in the future, on the one hand, it is hoped that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will effectively implement them, and on the other hand, it is hoped that all members will not consider the meeting as a closed matter, but should continue to supervise and promote them at any time, so that this meeting will not be in vain. Finally, I hope that the government can effectively (1) abolish excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees; (2) eliminate bandits and communists in various places; (3) reorganize land and water transportation; and (4) accumulate capital, then the prosperity of industry and commerce can be expected.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Record of the Collision of the Xinfeng Steamer <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The Keizan Maru failed to follow the navigation rules. The upper deck of the Xinfeng was destroyed. It returned to Shanghai for major repairs that day. It is not uncommon for Japanese ships to cause trouble. This time, the Xinfeng, a regular North China steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was damaged by a Japanese ship again on its way from Shanghai to Tianjin, causing huge losses. The details of this incident are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>The Truth About the Japanese Ship Causing the Trouble. The Xinfeng steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company arrived at about 6:00 AM on the 9th, about two nautical miles from the Tanggu estuary. The ship was entering the Baihe River, and the Keizan Maru, a Kobe-Tianjin steamer of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, was leaving Tianjin. The sea surface in that area is narrow, and the water level has been reduced recently. According to the rules, the Keizan Maru should have steered outward. Unexpectedly, the Japanese did not follow the navigation regulations and drove straight towards the Xinfeng steamer in the fairway. When the two ships were close to each other, Ma Xun, the captain of the Xinfeng, saw the Japanese ship coming head-on, and quickly pulled the siren to urge it to avoid to the outside. But the Japanese ship turned a deaf ear. In an instant, the two ships were close, and even if the Xinfeng urgently gave way, it was too late. With a bang, the Japanese ship crashed into the Xinfeng, and a great disaster was caused.</p>
<p>The Xinfeng Suffered Great Damage. The Japanese ship Keizan Maru has a displacement of about 4,000 tons, a huge hull, and a fast speed. If it had collided head-on, the Xinfeng would have sunk. Fortunately, the Xinfeng reversed to avoid the collision. However, the second and third decks of the ship were hit by the bow of the Keizan Maru, and the cabins and passenger rooms on these two decks, as well as the structures on the upper deck, were completely destroyed. Even the lifeboats on the deck were destroyed. Most of the second and third decks of the Xinfeng were destroyed. It can be seen that the loss was huge. If the passengers had not escaped early, a major tragedy would have occurred.</p>
<p>The Japanese Ship Admitted Its Fault. After the incident, Ma Xun, the captain of the Xinfeng, inspected the damage and negotiated with the captain of the Keizan Maru. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau received a telegram from Captain Ma Xun in Tianjin, stating that he had personally inspected the damaged area with the captain of the Japanese ship, drawn a diagram, and prepared it as the basis for negotiation. The Japanese knew that they were in the wrong. The captain of the Keizan Maru signed a document acknowledging the accident and taking responsibility. The document was received by Captain Ma Xun.</p>
<p>The Xinfeng Arrived in Tianjin to Unload Cargo. After inspecting the damage, the Xinfeng steamer was still able to sail because the cargo hold had not been damaged. Under the guidance of the pilot, it sailed into the Tianjin Zizhu Forest Wharf and docked. The passengers on board were only startled and not injured. They are now safely ashore. The cargo in the various holds is also being unloaded without any damage.</p>
<p>It Can Leave Tianjin Today. Because most of the passenger decks on the second and third floors have been destroyed, it is difficult to sail without major repairs in a dock. The ship is scheduled to leave Tianjin for Shanghai today. Yesterday, the Shanghai Bureau continued to receive telegrams from Tianjin saying that the Xinfeng steamer is still loading cargo from Tianjin as usual, but passengers are not being carried. The captain has ordered the business director to stop selling tickets for the sake of safe navigation. The amount of the loss will not be known until the ship arrives in Shanghai. Regarding the negotiations and claims against the Japanese ship, the Shanghai Bureau must also wait for the Xinfeng to arrive to inquire about the cause and course of the accident before the shipping department can estimate the loss and proceed with the claim.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Detailed Record of the Naval Second Fleet Maneuvers <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>More than ten warships, including the Chuyu, concentrated on Baguazhou in Nanjing for maneuvers. Under the command of Chen Shaokuan, Acting Minister of the Navy, the exercises have been going on for two weeks and will come to an end on the 5th of this month. It is said that on the 6th, Chen Shaokuan personally led the Chuyu, Jiangzhen, Chuqian, Jiangyuan, Chuguan, Chutai, and other ships of the Second Fleet from Beijing to the waters off Wusongkou for large-scale maneuvers. The ships were ordered to depart at 1:00 PM that afternoon. Chen personally led the entire Second Fleet staff on the flagship Chuyu to command, and summoned more than ten Tongji midshipmen and assigned them to various ships to increase their experience. When the flagship departed, the Yingrui warship stationed in Nanjing fired a 15-gun salute to show respect, and the Chuyu also returned the salute. Then, the ships followed each other in a single line at a distance of 400 yards. The fleet of warships advancing through the waves was extremely spectacular. During the voyage, the ships carried out various offensive and defensive tactics according to the signal flags, and practiced aircraft shooting. At about 4:00 PM, they passed the Jinshan and Jiaoshan mountains in Zhenjiang, and at 6:00 PM, they arrived at Dantu. As dusk fell, the ships were ordered to anchor. At 8:00 PM, the entire army maneuvered searchlights, and the electric torches were as bright as day. The terrain on both sides was clearly visible. Then they practiced the army's communication signals. The lights flashed on and off, transmitting messages, which was also very interesting. At 5:00 AM on the 7th, the sea breeze was biting cold and the dawn had not yet broken. Chen Shaokuan personally went to the lookout to command everything. At 7:00 AM, all the soldiers routinely stowed their hammocks, washed the decks, and performed physical exercises. At 9:00 AM, they arrived at Jiangyin. The Hai Chou warship was stationed there and fired a salute to greet them. The Chuyu returned the salute. At 10:00 AM, Chen ordered the entire army to practice international communication flags, about a hundred words. In a short time, it was completed. The soldiers' training in flag signals was indeed very skilled. Chen was very satisfied. At 11:00 AM, they passed the Duanshan Port. In the distance, the Qing Tian surveying boat was engaged in surveying work. At 1:00 PM, they passed Tongzhou. At 2:00 PM, they ordered the ships to practice firefighting, and the fire hoses were immediately prepared to be extremely fast. At 3:00 PM, the ships maneuvered various artillery techniques. At 4:00 PM, the entire team passed Liuhe. At about 5:00 PM, they arrived at Wusongkou. After the ships were ordered to anchor, they summoned the captains of each ship to the Chuyu flagship to give instructions on various maneuvers. At 7:00 PM, the entire army practiced the army's communication signals. At 8:00 PM, they suddenly ordered the ships to practice extinguishing fires and deploy night battle equipment. All the soldiers were well-trained and moved quickly. It is said that in addition to the six ships, including the Chuyu, Chen Shaobao also telegraphed the Yongsheng and Yisheng ships stationed in Shanghai to go to the waters off Wusongkou for joint exercises. At dawn on the 8th, Chen Shaokuan led the Second Fleet staff officers and aides from the Chuyu to the Chuqian warship, and ordered the ships to form a single line at 5:30 AM in a single line at a distance of 400 yards towards the Wusongkou waters, and divided the Chuqian, Chuguan, Chuyu, Yongsheng into the first team, and the Jiangzhen, Chutai, Jiangyuan, Yisheng into the second team. Along the way, they practiced various ship formations. The ships were arranged in various formations according to Chen's signal flags, changing their direction and situation. At about 8:00 AM, the weather at sea was windy. The soldiers still risked practicing fog cannons to convey orders. Therefore, in the thick fog, the ships could still operate freely, and they would not lose their targets or isolate the ships from each other. Then the rain became heavier, and all the officers and soldiers were drenched. Therefore, Chen ordered the entire team to return to Yiwosha and anchor. In the afternoon, the ships were ordered to operate freely, while the soldiers of the Chuyu wore raincoats and braved the rain to practice sampans, showing even more spirit. On the morning of the 9th, the sky was cloudy and the fog was thick. Chen still led the eight ships, including the Chuqian, to venture into the waters off Wusong. He also took the opportunity to launch fog cannons. The ships were able to fire cannons at a set time to convey orders. At the same time, he ordered the entire army to divide into two teams, A and B, to maneuver various fleet formations. The weather was slightly better at noon, but the wind was stronger and the waves were rough, so the ships swayed abnormally. However, the sailors were well-trained and accustomed to the wind and waves and did not suffer at all. After several hours of maneuvering ship formations, the entire team was near Huaniao Island. It was about 5:00 PM, so they ordered the ships to return to Yiwosha. They did not arrive at Yiwosha until 11:00 PM. On the morning of the 10th, Chen summoned the captains of the ships to the Chuyu flagship for training and pointed out the achievements of this exercise. At 7:00 AM, the ships were ordered to depart. The Jiangzhen, Chuqian, Chuguan, Jiangyuan, Chutai, Yongsheng, and Yisheng all went straight to Gaochang Temple and stationed there. Chen led the Chuyu flagship to Wusongkou to meet Chairman Chiang. At noon, Chairman Chiang took the Lianjing warship from Ningbo to Song. The Chuyu raised the full flag and fired a 21-gun salute. Chen then accompanied Chairman Chiang ashore to Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Strictly Interrogating the Assassin of Zhao <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Two interrogations have revealed several important accomplices. The handling agency will ask the Provincial Government to re-determine the killer of Zhao Tieqiao, former specialist of the China Merchants Bureau, Xia Shaoen. After County Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua personally went to Hefei to bring him back to Shanghai, he was detained at the County Public Security Bureau on the morning before yesterday. At about 10:00 AM that morning, he was interrogated by Bureau Chief Shen. The interrogation did not use severe interrogation methods, but only ordinary interrogation procedures. The suspect Xia Shaoen detailed the reasons and the beginning and end of the assassination of Zhao, and confessed several important accomplices. Finally, he stated that he was willing to sacrifice himself and had no fear. He was upright and regarded himself as a Jianghu hero. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Bureau Chief Shen interrogated him for the second time. The details he confessed were the same as the day before. At 3:30 PM, he was ordered to be returned to the patrol room on the west side of the lower floor and strictly guarded. Strangers were not allowed to visit and were not allowed to talk to others. The agency handling the suspect will report the situation to the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Government will designate the agency to handle the case and issue a decision. Xia's wife, Qian, left Shanghai in late last month and rushed to Hefei, her hometown, because she heard that the County Public Security Bureau had sent people to arrest him. Therefore, she rushed back to Anhui overnight to prepare to notify her husband Xia Shaoen to flee elsewhere to avoid arrest. However, when Xia's wife returned to Xiadian Village in the eastern township of Hefei, her husband had already been arrested for three days.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Murder on Railway Station Road <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>"Small Heart" stabbed five times, bleeding immediately and collapsing. Gu Xiaoxing, nicknamed "Small Heart," 34 years old, from Taizhou, currently residing at 32 Derun Lane, Railway Station Road, had paid homage to staff member Xu as his "Old Man." Gu had a close relationship with Cao Binglin, a gangster residing on Coal Dregs Road, and Cao had also paid homage to Mr. Pan, the owner of a local meat shop, as his "Old Man." Unexpectedly, Cao and Gu became estranged while helping friends, harboring private resentments. Suddenly, the other day, Cao, Gu, and others gathered to gamble at a house on Coal Dregs Road, and another argument broke out. Fortunately, the gamblers present persuaded them to disperse, preventing further incidents. However, yesterday at 8 a.m., Cao and Gu each summoned friends seeking revenge, and Cao Binglin made the first move, holding a sharp knife and waiting in Derun Lane. Gu Xiaoxing happened to be leaving his house to also invite friends, and they encountered each other. Cao Binglin then stabbed Gu violently with the knife, inflicting five wounds: two on the left shoulder, two on the right leg, and one fatal wound to the left waist. Gu immediately collapsed, bleeding profusely, and died instantly. The assailant, seeing that Gu was seriously injured and had collapsed, immediately fled. Subsequently, Chief Ma of the Second District Police Station on Railway Station Road learned of the incident and led police to investigate. They found that Gu had already died and the assailant had fled. The assailant's brother, Cao Bingsheng, was taken to the station for questioning, and then transferred to the Second District Headquarters and forwarded to the court for investigation. Meanwhile, the local bailiff was ordered to report to the court for an inquest. At 2 p.m., the court dispatched a prosecutor accompanied by an coroner to the scene for an inquest. It was confirmed that the deceased had been stabbed five times, with the one to the left waist being fatal. A coroner's report was filled out, and the family of the deceased was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial. A strict search for the fugitive Cao Binglin was ordered to bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Yu BaoRen insists on preserving his face. Cao Jinbiao has nothing to say. Liu Nianchun, the owner of Dingkang Gold Shop on Ningbo Road, was kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of his residence on North Chengdu Road on July 5th of this year, at 6:15 p.m., and a ransom of 40,000 yuan was demanded. The case was solved by Chinese Detectives Cao Ashan and Ruan Yao of the New Gate Police Station. One of the kidnappers, Yu BaoRen (29 years old) from Wuxi, was sent to the Special District Court for interrogation and confessed to the crime. On September 4th, Judge Sun Yuan sentenced him to death, and the sentence was submitted to the provincial government for approval. Yesterday afternoon, at the appointed time, the police escorted Yu to the Second Criminal Court of the court, where Judge Cheng Shangfeng questioned Yu about any last words. According to Yu, he requested that a letter be sent to his father, Yu Xinwan, at 1629 Chun Gui Lane, Haining Road, asking him not to come to collect his body after the execution and not to grieve, as he was harmed by others and had no face to return the body to his hometown. If there were any remaining funds, he could hire monks to pray for him and arrange for his sister to find a husband, and his wife was still young and could remarry. He had nothing else to say. Judge Cheng ordered him to be sent to the local court for execution. Another bandit, Cao Jinbiao, led a gang armed with weapons to break into the residence of Gu Maodi on Changping Road in West Shanghai on the evening of March 31st, at 8 p.m., robbing 343 yuan of property and shooting and killing Chinese Constable Liu Youqing of No. 463, and committing other robberies. After the case was reported, Chinese Detective Shen Chongli of the Gordon Road Police Station and others arrested Cao and sent him to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and sentencing to death, which was reported to the provincial government for approval. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng also came to the Second Criminal Court. According to Cao Jinbiao, he was from Jiangbei, 24 years old, and used to engage in kidnapping. He had a lined robe, glasses, a watch, silver coins, and change that were confiscated in the police station, and he requested that they be returned to his uncle, Wang Kui Cai, who lives at 7 Tianfu Lane, at the intersection of Hanzhong Road and Mingyuan Road in Binbei. He had nothing else to say and begged for food. Judge Cheng ordered him to be sent to the Local Court for execution and ordered Wang Kui Cai to be summoned to the court to receive the items. Then the Chinese and Western detectives led Yu and Cao down, along with photos and files, and escorted them in a car directly to the execution ground in Caohe. The Local Court appointed Prosecutor Yang Wenjun as the supervising officer and brought the court clerk and examiners, and ordered Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Sergeant Chen Xihui, and Execution Police Gu Hanqing and Wang Jianqing, and assistant police Hu Xianglin, Cai Zuoqing, and Zhang Chunsen, six people in total, to rush to the execution ground. After the judge took his seat, he questioned Yu BaoRen, who stated that he was 29 years old, from Wuxi, and lived on Haining Road. His father's name was Yu Xinhuai, and he had a sworn brother named Tian Hongsheng. After his death, please notify his father and friends, but do not write that he was shot, just say he died of a sudden illness, because death is not strange, but face is important. Cao Jinbiao said that he was 24 years old, from Funing, and lived in Tianbao Lane, he had nothing to say. The official order was executed, and Police Chief Yang ordered the police to lead them down for execution. The bodies were collected by the hall for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Another Woman Involved in the Yuan Shunwu Kidnapping Case <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Used to deliver meals inside the bandit's den. Sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Yuan Shunwu, a student at Great China University from Hubei, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits armed with weapons on Zhabei Middle Road on the afternoon of the 24th of last month. The other day, Chinese Detective Lu Gengsheng of the Yangshupu Police Station learned that a Suzhou woman, Zhou Mao, who lives at 105 Liping Road, Yangshupu, was related to the case, and went to arrest her and sent her to the women's prison for detention. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. According to Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station, he stated the case. Then Liu Shaoqing, an investigator from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, submitted an official document requesting that she be transferred and interrogated together with Zou Yaodong and others who had already been arrested. When questioned, Zhou Mao confessed that her husband's name was Zhou Qingzhi and that he was on the run and she did not know where he had gone, but she had been living with him for about five years. Her husband used to be a cook in a flour factory. On that day, the victim was kidnapped by others and lived in the factory's firewood shed. They said that he was a student at a certain school, and the doorkeeper, Cai, and others said that he was a friend and did not say that he was a victim. Her husband cooked his meals and asked her to deliver them to the student. Two days later, the Public Security Bureau and police station investigators solved the case. At that time, she happened to be elsewhere. The rest of her statement was evasive. After verification by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that the defendant Zhou Mao, whose crime took place in the Chinese territory, be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau to be taken away and tried together with Zou Yaodong and others.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Hu Fuzhang's Mental Illness Problem <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Hu held a knife with intent to kill his mother.</p>
<p>Was it a mental illness outbreak?</p>
<p>This point needs to be carefully identified.</p>
<p>The judge set a two-month deadline. Sun Kui, the preparing director of the Forensic Medical Examination Institute of the Judicial Administration Department, was previously reported to be going to France soon to purchase medical equipment. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi of the Special District Court continued the trial of Hu Fuzhang, the son of Hu Aji, a Chinese constable of the Three Docks Police Station in Hongkou, who held a knife with intent to kill his mother. Sun specially came to court to testify. After Hu Fuzhang was accused, his father and uncle both testified that Fuzhang had a mental illness. The court ordered Sun Da Fang to examine him. According to Sun's report, he was indeed suffering from mental illness. Subsequently, the HSBC Police Station sent Hu Fuzhang to the Public Works Department Hospital for examination. After the hospital kept Hu for seven days and was repeatedly diagnosed by Western doctors, no mental illness was found. They reported to the court that he was free of mental illness. Judge Wu reviewed the reports of the forensic doctor and the Public Works Department doctor, which were completely contradictory. It was difficult to determine which was correct. The case was postponed pending further investigation. The above was reported previously. Yesterday morning, in addition to Sun's testimony, a Chinese doctor surnamed Huang from the Public Works Department Hospital also came to court to state the diagnosis of Hu Fuzhang's condition. Judge Wu first asked Hu Aji if the defendant had a mental illness. According to Aji, my son Fuzhang had his head broken by a teacher with a ruler when he was studying at Tianbao Lane, and blood flowed like a waterfall. He was sent to the hospital for treatment, and because the teacher had apologized, he was still allowed to study with him. He only suffered from mental illness after he got married at the age of twenty. He had three previous attacks. The first attack was about twenty-three or four years old. One day, after drinking alcohol, he suddenly hit his head with a bowl, causing blood to flow. His face was like a martial arts fanatic. During the second and third attacks, he only cried or laughed, and each time he was forced to sleep for a while and then recovered. This action was really a recurrence of an old illness. On September 30, he had dinner with my younger brother's family and drank alcohol. After the meal, he took a knife and went home. When he arrived in the alley, my wife happened to be going out of the house. He intended to attack, but my wife grabbed his collar. I heard the alarm at home and rushed out with a door bolt and knocked his shin, and he fell to the ground. I took his knife and called the police to arrest him. Then, according to Dr. Huang of the Public Works Department, Hu Fuzhang was sent to the hospital by the HSBC Police Station on the night of October 9 and sent back to the police station by the hospital on the 16th. During this period, Hu Fuzhang was hospitalized and repeatedly examined by doctors and reported by nurses. His daily life, diet, conversation, and actions were no different from ordinary people, and there was no sign of mental disorder. Therefore, it was concluded that he had no mental illness. Judge Wu asked again, "Is the defendant not suffering from mental illness, or does he have this disease but it has not been detected during this period?" Dr. Huang replied that if he did have this disease, there must be unusual actions that could be observed during these few days, but he showed nothing. Judge Wu then asked again, "If there is mental illness that has not been detected, can it be detected by diagnosis within seven days?" The doctor replied, "It is difficult to be certain, but it would be more certain if the examination period were longer." Next, according to Sun Kui Fang, the report he prepared on the examination of the defendant was said to have been too lengthy. In fact, according to medical principles, the report was still too brief. Mental illness and neurological disease are two different types of diseases. Patients with mental illness are caused by stimulation of the brain, while neurological disease must have an action. Therefore, mental illness is not easy to diagnose and must refer to the events of his life. That is why the report detailed his infection with syphilis and smoking, etc. Syphilis is a very dishonorable disease. The patient's mental state is certainly extremely unpleasant, and the onset of this disease also has different durations. The brief one recovers in a moment and is most difficult to detect. Those whose onset is long-lasting and does not heal are easier to examine. Sun also listed the theory to cite evidence. After the interrogation, Judge Wu picked up his pen and said, "Whether Hu Fuzhang has mental illness and whether he took the knife home this time due to mental illness, a deadline of two months is set for the forensic doctor to conduct a detailed identification with the two doctors of the Public Works Department Hospital and issue an identification report as evidence for review."</p>
<h3 id="e116">Case of a Female Teacher Abandoned <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Haisheng has three golden houses in Shanghai. There is another hair wife living in the Jiangwan countryside. Ni Xiuzhen, a female teacher at Binhai Elementary School in this city, has filed a lawsuit in the Special District Court against Zhu Haisheng for seduction and abandonment. According to Ni Xiuzhen's report, Zhu Haisheng, 32 years old, is a foreman at the Ruirong Iron Factory and earns a considerable monthly income. Therefore, his hair wife lives in the Jiangwan countryside, and he has three golden houses in Shanghai. The first is in Shende Lane, Huade Road, the second is Ni Xiuzhen, and the third is in Yulin Lane, Pingliang Road. Another child, one year and five months old, was born to Zhu and another person and is now taken back to Huade Road for foster care. As for Ni Xiuzhen, her hometown is Nanjing, her father died four years ago, and her family is poor. Since childhood, her younger brother studied at Wushi Elementary School, and then she supported the Xingnv School before dropping out and taking a teaching position at Wushi. This was three years ago. After that, she took a teaching position at Binhai Elementary School and met Zhu Haisheng. The feelings between the two became increasingly warm and they cohabited. However, because the wedding was not officially held, Ni feared her mother's opposition and concealed the matter, saying that she lived at the school. Last winter, she became pregnant and dropped out of school. Her mother still thought she was teaching at the school. This spring, Zhu gradually became estranged from her, pretending to be busy with factory affairs. Initially, she did not expect that Zhu had built a third golden house in Pingliang Road since cohabiting with Ni the year before. After various efforts, he had not revealed it. Since June of this year, Ni gave birth to a child at Guangren Hospital, and Zhu disappeared to Ni's place, and the monthly allowance was also cut off. Ni visited the factory many times, but Zhu refused to see her, claiming to be ill. At this point, Ni realized that he had two other golden houses in Shanghai, but it was too late to regret. After Ni filed a lawsuit with the court, Zhu tried to persuade her through others, willing to settle for 400 gold. However, Ni requested 5,000 yuan in alimony and waited for Zhu Haisheng to be summoned to court this Friday for further verification.</p>

<p>Two shots fired, two bandits arrested. Yangshupu Police Station Detective Zhang Yunjian was waiting for the No. 9 public bus in the Shenjiatan area of Yangshupu yesterday morning when he caught sight of two men getting on the bus one after the other, acting suspiciously.

Another Yangshupu Police Station Detective got on the bus. Detective Zhang signaled his companion to conduct a search. Unexpectedly, the two men saw that the situation was not good and became panicked. They took out their guns and fired at the detectives, firing two shots in total. Fortunately, no one was injured.

<p>Corpse Found the Next Day</p>
<p>Chest Became Bluish-Purple</p>
<p>Lin Jiashan, a machine mechanic at Sassoon House, left his apprentice Ye Changrong in the machine room of the cellar at the address on the 8th of this month to find an iron bar. Ye took a flashlight with him because the cellar was quite dark. The electrical wire on the light leaked, causing Ye to be electrocuted. Because there was no one in the cellar at the time, no one knew until the next morning when a mechanic entered the cellar and saw Ye lying on the ground, his chest turning bluish-purple. Knowing that he had been electrocuted, he reported it to everyone and then to the Main Police Station. The detectives went to investigate and carried Ye's body to the autopsy office on Faelon Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu Mei of the Special District Court came to the office to inspect the body. After taking his seat, Lin Jiashan arrived at the case to testify and prove that the deceased was electrocuted in the cellar. According to Wang Lieming, the deceased's cousin, the deceased's brother was buying a coffin and could not come to the case, so I can take the lead. Also, Bei Quilai, the Western assistant mechanic of Sassoon, made several statements. Prosecutor Xu ordered the forensic doctor to examine the case again and again and determined that it was an electrocution. Then he announced that the deceased Ye Changrong had been identified by the forensic doctor as electrocuted, and the body was taken by the cousin Wang Lieming for coffin burial.</p>

<p>Ran away with everything. Li Zixiang, 38 years old, from Jiaxing, lived in poverty at 33 Lujiazhai, Pudong, and made a living by selling vegetables. Because he lost his wife early, he remarried a 14-year-old girl from Liuhe, Ms. Wei, as his successor. Ms. Wei is now 26 years old and has given birth to three sons, the oldest being nine years old, the second six years old, and the youngest only two years old. In the spring of this year, he died prematurely. Unexpectedly, Ms. Wei has recently changed her mind, hating her husband for being old and poor, and secretly had an affair with Lu Fugen, a 24-year-old carpenter at 6 Tongxing Street next door. Lu has not yet married. The two were affectionate and secretly agreed to be together for life. Every morning at 4 o'clock, when Li was crossing the Pujiang River to pick up goods, Lu took the opportunity to have an affair with Ms. Wei. After a long time, her nine-year-old son informed him. Li immediately paid attention to monitoring Ms. Wei's actions. Ms. Wei knew that the matter had been revealed and could not be fulfilled, so she seized the opportunity when her husband went out to collect accounts at 7 o'clock the night before, and ran away with her clothes and ornaments with Lu. Li invited friends to search everywhere that night. At 5 o'clock yesterday morning, he happened to meet Lu Fugen returning home to get clothes. He was arrested by Police Officer Chen, a tunnel police officer of the Fourth Squad, and escorted to the Third District for questioning. According to Lu, Ms. Wei is now hiding at Room 16 of the Rongsheng Hotel behind the Sincere Company on the Great World Road. She was willing to follow him and did not abduct her. The district chief took the statement and immediately sent investigators Zhang Yong and Yang Jinsen to take Lu to the hotel at 4 o'clock in the afternoon to find Ms. Wei and send her to the district. The husband saw that the gold ring on her ear had been taken away by Lu. Thirty-six silver yuan was also taken away. Ms. Wei also firmly denied it and said that she would rather die than go home. The judgment was made to prepare a document to be transferred to the local court for questioning.</p>

Beforehand, invitations were sent to all walks of life to attend the ceremony, so before 5 o'clock, skirts and shoes gathered, and the hair and clothes were very popular for a while. First, Yaoge Luofu from the Tibek Lawyer's Office held the opening ceremony. Under the leadership of Wu Linjiang, the manager of the theater, the embroidered curtain slowly opened to thunderous applause. Then, the sound news, the silver screen song, and "The Passionate Plumber", starring the male lead Hiverlé, were shown. The plot was fragrant and tortuous, the performance was delicate and expressive, the dialogue was clear and understandable, and the singing was smooth and pleasant. It was truly a rare and outstanding sound masterpiece. In addition, the sound machine of the theater is the largest and most perfect sound machine in Shanghai. It was contracted by the Western Electric Company and was leased to the open-air movie theater of the Dahua Hotel. At that time, it won unanimous praise from Chinese and Western people. The theater recovered it and operated it by itself, striving for perfection. The seat prices are also particularly low, only selling for four corners and six corners of foreign currency. The sound films shown are all blockbusters from Paramount, Electric Ray, and Columbia, three major companies, which are extraordinary. It is expected that the business will have a surprising development in the near future. It will be officially released to the public today and will begin selling seats.</p>

<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River steamer Jianghua, en route from Shanghai to Hankou, encountered bandits at approximately 10:00 AM yesterday when passing Jiujiang, near Huangzhou Cai Dian. As the ship was navigating upstream, the bandits planned to劫 (rob) the vessel. Initially, the bandits fired warning shots at the Jianghua, intending to force it to stop. However, the captain of the Jianghua, Wang Muzong, fearing the danger of being robbed, immediately ordered the driver to proceed upstream at full speed. The bandits on the shore then switched to firing cannons, launching eight consecutive shots at the ship. The situation was extremely perilous, and all passengers on board lay prone in their cabins, afraid to move. Fortunately, the driver accelerated to full speed, managing to evade the cannon fire. None of the eight shots hit the ship, a truly fortunate outcome. However, the crew members were deeply alarmed. Yesterday's telegram from Shanghai reported that the Jianghua had safely escaped danger and was heading towards Hankou.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Disputes over Water Rate Increases in the Concession <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Ignoring public opinion, the water company has set a deadline for collecting the increased water fees. The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association in the foreign concession received a letter yesterday from taxpayer Wu Jishun regarding the Shanghai Waterworks Company in the public concession setting a deadline to collect the increased water fees. The impact of this action could potentially lead to disputes. We have extracted and recorded the relevant correspondence below:</p>
<p>Wu Jishun's Letter to the Ratepayers' Association:</p>
<p>Regarding the unreasonable water price increase by the water company, your esteemed association has repeatedly engaged in negotiations. Now, the company has suddenly sent a notice to each household, stating, "If you do not comply with the increased payment by November 28th of this year, water supply will be suspended." As a taxpayer within the concession, Jishun believes that the increased water price should not be paid until your association reaches a resolution. We should adhere to the principles of your esteemed association and not deviate to undermine public opinion.</p>
<p>The Ratepayers' Association's Reply to Wu Jishun:</p>
<p>Having received your letter of November 9th, we wish to inform you that before the audit of water prices is completed and a decision is made to increase them, payments should continue at the original rate (i.e., 6% of the rent). Our association has already stated to the Shanghai Waterworks Company that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has rejected the increase, and the Shanghai Real Estate Association has repeatedly published announcements to that effect. The company's warning to users, setting a deadline with the threat of water suspension, is tantamount to strangling people to seize their property. How can anyone not feel resentment and rise up to fight for their rights? Please refuse to pay the increased water fees and do not succumb to threats, as we actively negotiate in accordance with principles of justice.</p>
<p>The Ratepayers' Association's Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council:</p>
<p>Having received a letter from Mr. Wu Jishun stating that the Shanghai Waterworks Company has suddenly sent a notice to each household stating, "If you do not comply with the increased payment by November 28th of this year, water supply will be suspended," we wish to inform you that residents, both Chinese and foreign, have voiced their opposition to this water price increase. Therefore, an audit has been initiated to seek a peaceful resolution. At the beginning of the audit, our association stated to the Shanghai Waterworks Company that "before the audit is completed and a decision is made to increase prices, water prices should continue to be collected at the original rate (i.e., 6% of the rent). If it is later deemed necessary to increase prices, supplementary payments will be made." The company has disregarded this statement and has recently issued a concrete written warning to users, threatening water suspension. Water is an essential element of human life, almost as important as air. The company's threat of water suspension to force users to pay the increased water fees is like strangling people to seize their property. What desire cannot be fulfilled? However, the pursuit of life is a natural instinct. If the company insists on implementing its actions, which are tantamount to strangling people to seize the increased water fees, users, in order to safeguard their lives, will inevitably be forced to resist. What will become of public order? We hereby request that you investigate and seriously consider appropriate measures to mitigate this significant potential risk.</p>

<p>Refusing to Publish Advertisements for Java Company and Ship Import/Export News</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation sent a letter to the local Newspaper Guild yesterday, stating: "Our country's female teacher, Ms. Xiao Xin'an, was brutally assaulted by the Dutch second mate of the Java Company's ship 'Tjibadak.' Your esteemed guild's newspapers have provided detailed coverage, with some publishing critical articles and others writing satirical pieces. The entire nation is deeply appreciative. Our federation and other organizations believe that verbal and written condemnation is sufficient to support the extension of justice, and boycotts and disconnections can serve as a backing after negotiations. We have repeatedly appealed, and we understand that the advertising department and the shipping schedule section are still publishing advertisements for the Java Company and the import/export news of its Java-class ships. It is not that they are unwilling to express sympathy, but because your esteemed guild has not yet convened a meeting to decide on the matter, there is still a waiting period. In order to achieve national unity, our federation has sent representative Lin Youren to your esteemed guild to discuss assistance. We were instructed by your esteemed guild to submit another letter, which we will certainly do. Therefore, we earnestly request that your esteemed guild, considering that the assault on Ms. Xiao is not only a personal disgrace to her but also a disgrace to the entire Chinese nation, approve the early convening of an emergency temporary meeting to accommodate our request. Starting immediately, unanimously refuse to publish advertisements for the Java Company and the import/export news of its ships 'Tjibadak,' 'Tjikareng,' 'Tjisandari,' 'Tjifcdas,' 'Tjipanas,' and 'Tjiliwong,' in order to vent public outrage. The faith of compatriots at home and abroad in your esteemed guild and its newspapers will continue to grow day by day. We would appreciate it if you could indicate whether this is feasible."</p>
<h3 id="e132">Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant Officially Opens Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Will Make Great Contributions to the Industrial Sector</p>
<p>Shanghai merchants Wu YunChu, Zhu Ziqian, Shen Yichang, Zhang Yiyun, Wang Dongyuan, etc., recognizing the severe shortage of industrial raw materials in our country, pooled their resources to establish the Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant on Baililan Road in Western Shanghai, specializing in the production of industrial products such as hydrochloric acid and caustic soda. The plant is large in scale, fully equipped, and has been under preparation for a year. The various products have been repeatedly tested by experts and are highly suitable for industrial use. Yesterday, the plant held its official opening ceremony at the Yipinxian restaurant, inviting guests from all walks of life. Among those present were Zheng Hongnian, Vice Minister of Industry and Commerce; Zhao Jinqing, representative of Minister Kong; Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau; Zhou Zijing, representative of the Central Research Institute; Guo Chengen, Director of the Arsenal; Yang Rumei; Shen Xiongqing; Wu Renzhi; Zhang Wuxin; Li Yunshu; Chang Jinqu; Zheng Shouzhi; Zou Bingwen; Cao Liangxia; and representatives from various paper-making, dyeing, and weaving factories, as well as British, American, and Japanese guests, totaling over two hundred people. The atmosphere was lively and bustling. After three rounds of wine, Zhu Ziqian, Chairman of the Board of Directors, Shen Yichang, Wang Dongyuan, and others delivered welcoming speeches, thanking the guests. At around 3:00 PM, the attendees dispersed and traveled to the plant in cars provided by the factory to observe the opening ceremony. They arrived at the plant at 3:30 PM and proceeded to the auditorium for a meeting. Director Wu of the plant respectfully read the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and reported on the establishment process. Zhao Jinqing, representing Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, then delivered a speech on behalf of the minister, stating that the electrical and chemical industry is closely related to the progress of civilization. For example, aluminum was once considered a rare and valuable metal, making it impractical for manufacturing tools. Since the invention of the electrolytic aluminum process by the American Hall in 1890, everyday utensils such as cookware have been completely replaced by aluminum, which users find convenient. The price of aluminum has plummeted. In 1855, it was valued at fifty pounds sterling per kilogram, but by the end of the nineteenth century, it had dropped to one shilling. Most surprisingly, as the price of aluminum fell, the profits of aluminum smelting companies increased, demonstrating that both production and consumption benefit from electrochemistry. In China, apart from electroplating, industries such as electrolysis and electrometallurgy are virtually non-existent. Mr. Wu YunChu has uniquely pioneered this factory, opening a new chapter in China's electrochemical industry. His spirit is truly admirable. I have always placed great emphasis on basic industries. During the Third Plenary Session, I drafted a plan for state-owned basic industries. At this industrial and commercial conference, there were many proposals to encourage privately owned basic industries, indicating that the Chinese people are gradually paying more attention to this matter. Caustic soda and hydrochloric acid, two products of the Tianyuan plant, are important raw materials in basic industries. The fact that the private sector can establish such a plant is commendable, and the government should do its utmost to encourage and protect it. After the speech, the attendees proceeded to the boiler room for the opening ceremony. Zhao Jinqing and Pan Gongzhan performed the fire-lighting ceremony, accompanied by the sound of firecrackers. After the ceremony, photographs were taken, and the event concluded.</p>

<p>The City Training Department held an expanded city training conference convened by the Shanghai Special City Party Department Training Department at its auditorium on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 1:00 PM, attended by over a hundred people.

After the reports, they discussed and resolved over thirty important cases, concluding the meeting after 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Scheduled Memorial Service for Fan Zhengluo <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Wang Yufen, Xu Qin, Shen Zengyi, Ren Liping, Zhang Mingqin, Tong Zikun, Yi Zuanren, Cao Runcang, Gao Yunlv, Zhu Yaoting, Chen Zikuan, Gang Yusong, Zhang Jiafu, Yao Benyuan, Fan Ningshu, Ye Weiyi, Ding Yaxian, Gu Zhenzhong, and others announce a memorial service for Comrade Fan Zhengluo:</p>
<p>The 12th of this month marks the most memorable anniversary of our comrade Fan Zhengluo's martyrdom. Time passes quickly, and a year has gone by. We, the comrades, mourn the passing of this man, deeply saddened by the approaching day. Several years ago, Mr. Fan, residing in Henan, was angered by the British exploitation and tirelessly campaigned, resulting in the miners' strike. At that time, his ambition could overwhelm powerful merchants, and his actions were sufficient to gain the trust of his peers. Had he been able to fulfill his potential and extend his influence, would the people of Henan alone have relied on him? Yet, he was assassinated by treacherous individuals, his great ambition concealed and unfulfilled, cut short in his prime. This is not only Mr. Fan's misfortune but also our shared grief. We undertake this action to lament the passing of those who cannot be revived and to hope that future generations will carry on. Mr. Fan has passed away, but we hope that those who will rise in his place will be our hope, and that is what we deeply desire. On this afternoon at 2:00 PM, a memorial service will be held at the Guandi Temple in Laoximen. If you have couplets, please send them in advance.</p>

<p>Five Labor Unions: Shanghai Shipping Timber Industry, Xiang Sheng Ironworks, Qiu Xin Shipyard, He Xing Shipyard, Rui Rong Ironworks, and other five labor unions issued a declaration regarding the Xin Dingchang case: (Omitted above) This case of the brutal killing of boatman Xin Dingchang by French sailors demonstrates the imperialists' contempt for our people's lives, treating them worse than dogs. Now that Dingchang has been brutally murdered, it is indeed a great misfortune that the weak are preyed upon by the strong. However, we and other unions, while still alive, should take the Xin case as a warning, grit our teeth, and vow to support the diplomacy behind the scenes. In the shortest possible time, we demand that the French government provide generous compensation to Dingchang's family for funeral expenses, and, in accordance with the precedents of our country compensating foreigners, provide alimony to his family. Furthermore, the perpetrators should be severely punished and a formal apology issued to our country. In addition, they must be responsible for guaranteeing that no similar incidents occur in the future. If there is no satisfactory resolution, we vow to fight the French imperialists to the death. We hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and pursue this matter to the end. This is our declaration.</p>

<h3 id="e142">A Visit to the Tianyi Pavilion Library in Ningbo <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Sixin</p>
<p>Among the oldest private libraries in China, the Tianyi Pavilion of the Fan family in Ningbo is the most enduring. The pavilion was founded during the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty by Fan Qin, who was titled "Dai Lang." Qin, whose given name was Yaoqing and courtesy name was Dongming, was a Jinshi graduate in the eleventh year of Jiajing. He successively held prominent positions such as Right Vice Minister of the Ministry of War. He once opposed Guo Xun and was known for his strong will. Even Yan Song was deeply afraid of him. Qin loved collecting books and built the Tianyi Pavilion to purchase rare editions from across the country, classified into the four categories of classics, history, philosophy, and literature. He was particularly adept at collecting commentaries on the classics and collections of poems and essays by early scholars that had not been passed down. However, the books in the pavilion consisted mostly of old items from the Wanjuange library of the Feng family in Chengxi. The Feng family was descended from the Qingmin Duke and produced prominent figures in each generation, so their collection of books was incomparably rich. It is a pity that their descendant, Daosheng, suffered from a mental illness late in life and became so obsessed with books and ink that he lost his family's wealth. Nearly 60% of the books in the Wanjuange library, including Song dynasty transcriptions, were stolen by his students. Later, a major fire destroyed much of what remained. Sir Fan had previously copied books from Daosheng, so he used what remained to add to his own pavilion. He also copied books from Mr. Huang Lizhou to supplement his collection. Although he was unable to restore the Feng family's library to its former glory, he was still a dominant figure in Eastern Zhejiang. During the late Qing Dynasty, his descendant, the Minister of the Board of Civil Office, Duke Lu, continued to add to the collection. During the Qianlong reign, the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries) was compiled, and the books in the pavilion were copied and added to the imperial library. Duke Lu was awarded the Jishu Jicheng (Collected Writings of the Jishu Studio) by the emperor. During the Taiping Rebellion, the pavilion was damaged and the books were scattered. Although many were redeemed through various means, it was impossible to prevent them from being lost. During the Guangxu reign, Xue Fucheng, an observer from Wuxi, took advantage of his spare time in Eastern Zhejiang to visit the pavilion and lament the loss of the books, realizing how difficult it would be to purchase more. He then established categories and assigned Qian Nianqu from Gui'an to proofread the books. It took two years and three revisions to complete the existing catalogue of the Tianyi Pavilion. Since the founding of the Republic of China, the pavilion has been burgled twice, and 60% of the books have been lost, with the most prized volumes stolen. Yang Ziyi, the mayor of Ningbo, has proposed reorganizing the catalogue for publication. On October 21st, Bao Sixin, who happened to be in Ningbo, was able to visit the pavilion and felt fortunate to have the opportunity to browse the collection. The pavilion is located west of Moon Lake, with beautiful scenery of ponds and rocks in front. A plaque reading "Treasure Book Building" hangs below the pavilion, with a couplet inscribed with imperial approval: "A grand sight of a city of books, rarely seen in the human world." There are also two couplets by the historian Quan Zuwang: "Looking south, the dense forests are turned into stone paths, and the treasures are all returned to the outstanding pavilion. Looking west, the city of Qi should lament that one's floating life has fallen far behind the high gate," and "A hundred thousand volumes of silk-covered books are arranged in order, laughing at the unworthiness of green bamboo and dark clouds. For three hundred years, the pure and secret light has brightly connected the eastern building, and the green lotus pond is not far away." The upper floor of the pavilion is where the books are stored. Normally, the pavilion is only opened once a year to air the books, and outsiders are not allowed to enter. This time, thanks to the special permission of the owner, the pavilion was temporarily opened. Mr. Fan Luqi, the head of the sixth branch of the Fan family, led the visitors to the upper floor. The pavilion consists of six rooms connected as one, separated by bookshelves. Cloud stones are placed under the shelves to prevent moisture. The pavilion is divided into six rooms, taking the meaning of "Heaven is born from water, and Earth is formed by six." The name "Tianyi" is also derived from this. After entering the pavilion, the owner first presented the "Victory Picture of Pacifying the Hui Region," which was awarded by the emperor. The picture is meticulously painted and contains an imperial inscription. It is a rare sight. I had previously seen a similar picture at the Xujiahui Library in Shanghai. Next, I read portraits of ancient emperors, famous officials, and Confucian scholars. The inscriptions seemed to be drawn with a hook, so I guessed they were imitations. Then, I opened the shelves and read the books. There were mostly Ming dynasty editions, with very few Song dynasty editions, and many were incomplete. Secret books and manuscripts, such as Cai Guangzhi's "Treatise," were not available elsewhere and were truly precious. Due to the limited time, I was unable to examine them in detail. Finally, I viewed the steles, with the Tang dynasty Shenlong edition of Chu Suiliang's copy of the Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Poems being the most valuable. There were also wooden plaques from the Fan family's collection, but unfortunately, many were decayed. After the visit, I bid farewell to the owner and returned. Mr. Huang Lizhou and the historian Quan Zuwang both praised the Tianyi Pavilion in their records, and its reputation was highly regarded by scholars. It is a pity that after several disasters and thefts, the precious books were scattered and difficult to restore to their former glory. Now, Mayor Yang is considering reorganizing the catalogue to further organize the collection. This is something that those concerned about the country are pleased to hear. Therefore, I wrote this record to commemorate this great event.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Record of the Xu-Huang Wedding <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Jingqing</p>
<p>The sixth of this month was the day for the wedding of Mr. Huang Cuojiu's daughter. The Qian and Kun halls of Yipinxian Restaurant were reserved. The groom, Mr. Xu, courtesy name Xiaochu, had experience in literature, politics, and business. He is currently employed at the Sino-French Pharmacy. Mr. Pei Lishen, the groom's father, is a famous lawyer from Suzhou and has served as the Director of the Land Bureau of Anhui Province. The bride, Ms. Gengbao, is a high-achieving graduate of the Sino-Western Girls' School. This match is a perfect couple, a pearl and jade alliance. Although there were light rain and wind during the day, the guests were already crowded. Prominent figures from political and business circles in Beijing and Shanghai all personally came to offer their congratulations. The music provided by the Moteli Company played in turns in the hall, melodious and pleasant. From morning onwards, each table was set with Western pastries made by the Maikesikai Candy Company, surpassing those made by Sullivan. The guests ate their fill of the delicious food, and by the time of the luncheon, almost everyone was unable to eat any more.</p>
<p>In the two halls, both old and new, there were countless banners, plaques, and screens on the walls. The large banners donated by Zhang Jingjiang, Chu Minyi, Sun Binqi, and Xu Shiying were particularly eye-catching to the guests. Yu Youren's couplet, "Weaving dew into pearls, spreading the sunset into curtains, picking duckweed to fill baskets, brewing wine to fill goblets," and Wang Yiting's couplet, "Jujubes and sesame seeds can feed guests, rare flowers and trees guard the eternal spring," and Lin Kanghou's couplet, "Three thousand pairs of bejeweled shoes fill the auspicious family, and brightly colored carriages fill the gate," were all beautiful works. My humble work was a painting of mandarin ducks, titled "Jade Maiden Smiles at Mandarin Ducks, Urging the Heart to Release Fragrant Petals, Warm Curtains and Hibiscus Quilt, Emerald Pair Sharing Dreams Through the Long Night." On this day, guests came from morning to night without end. There were thousands of staff members from the Great World, the Day and Night Bank, various Chinese and Western pharmacies, Jiufu Company, Jiuzhitang Zhai, and the Tainwu Stage. When the ceremony was held, they lined up in an orderly manner, resembling fish swimming in a row.</p>
<p>When the clock struck five, the wedding officiant, Mr. Shao Lizi, arrived on time. I have known him for many years, and we happily reminisced. The time passed quickly. Then, I heard loud music, indicating that the wedding car had arrived. At the wedding ceremony, the sound of musical instruments rang out as the wedding march was played. The matchmakers, Ma Bingxun and Zhou Mengbai, walked in front, followed by the groom and bride, and the attendants in order. Xie Jixiang, the groom's attendant, with his handsome demeanor, was the focus of the crowd's attention. Leng Yuren gave a wonderful speech as a guest speaker, with witty remarks that were met with thunderous applause. Mr. Shao Lizi gave a long speech, encouraging the newlyweds to love each other. His words were heartfelt and could be described as the ultimate praise.</p>
<p>In the evening, there were various performances at the Great World, which were very exciting. After the banquet was over, I, along with Mr. Leng and Mr. Gaoye Zhang, went to Mr. Xu's residence on Yuyuan Road for the bridal chamber teasing. The guests indulged in playful banter, and the room was filled with suggestive remarks. The blushing bride and groom were forced to kiss each other, but the attempt ultimately failed.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Records of Odd People and Strange Habits <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhenhu</p>
<p>People have different hobbies and different loves. However, there is no one who likes to eat poisonous things like snakes and insects. If there is, then it is the odd person Hailancha who is currently performing in public at the Great World. He has come to Shanghai from the sea, and the whole city is buzzing with excitement. Yesterday, the owner of the Great World asked Mr. Li Yaoliang to invite the press to watch. The guests were warmly welcomed. First, they were served cakes specially made by the Maikesikai Company, which tasted especially good. It was a great pleasure to both eat and watch. Therefore, I wrote this record.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Odd Person: The teahouse was crowded, and for a moment, it became lively. First, a certain gentleman described Hailan's brief history, saying that there was a Hailancha in the early Qing Dynasty who liked to eat living creatures. The current Hailancha is probably his descendant. He escaped into the mountains as a child and lived off insects, animals, fruits, and raw blood. He was discovered by people in the mountains at the age of twenty-two and has been living among them for five years. He has learned a little human language. When asked, he says that he is a Manchurian from Qingdao. His voice is loud and clear. However, looking at his clothes, he is the same as ordinary people and has completely shed the wildness of a person from the mountains.</p>
<p>The Horrific Performance: After a certain gentleman finished speaking, he took out two crawling insects from underground and handed them to Hailan. Hailan, wearing a long gown, velvet hat, and sunglasses, held the insects and threw them into his mouth. He chewed them as if they tasted quite good. In a short time, he swallowed them completely. He then swallowed two tree root insects and ate them as before. Then, a cage of mice was brought out, squeaking. Hailan took one of them and put it in his mouth. With a bang, the mouse's head was broken off, and blood dripped down. The mouse was still rolling on the ground. Hailan chewed and swallowed the head, bones, and fur. Then, a dove was brought out, which he ate as if it were a mouse. His teeth were like sharp blades. The most horrific thing to witness was killing a rabbit. Hailan took a large white rabbit and grabbed its four feet with both hands. The rabbit cried out. Hailan bit the rabbit's neck and tore out a mouthful of fur, revealing red flesh. Then, he slowly ate the meat from its back with relish, while the rabbit was still wriggling. He then ate two poisonous snakes. The crowd applauded and dispersed. Hailan can be called an odd person with strange habits.</p>

<p>— Huijian</p>
<p>At eight o'clock on the eighth day, I went to the Zhejiang Highway Bureau at the New Market to purchase tickets for the Haining Tide Watching bus, each ticket costing three dollars and twenty cents. The bus was smaller than the usual public bus, only accommodating seventeen passengers. At eight fifteen, the bus departed, passing through the city of Hangzhou and exiting Qingtai Gate. Haining is about ninety miles from Hangzhou, and the journey takes two hours. The highway is newly built and not too bumpy. After leaving Qingtai Gate, both sides of the road are lined with bamboo forests, which only end at Qibao. The sunlight penetrates the bamboo, making the bus window as dark as night. At ten o'clock, we arrived at Dadongmen in Haining. Many tourists had already arrived. The Haining County Government had set up a reception area beside the central tea garden, on the levee, which was very crowded. The tide-watching platform was divided into three sections: one built by the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, one by the Zhejiang Highway Bureau, and one as a general viewing platform, each accommodating hundreds of people. Several viewing pavilions were set up on the eastern embankment, like private boxes, with large white paper signs reading "Haining Local Court Reception Area." I stood there for a while, admiring the view of the Qiantang River, a thousand miles of white, a truly magnificent scene. Opposite us was the territory of Xiaoshan, with a pointed mountain between Haining and Xiaoshan, which could be clearly distinguished with a telescope. Old Lan, feeling hungry, went from behind the Zhenhai Pagoda to Chunxi Gate Street for a snack. Seeing that it was still early, he entered the city and visited the God of the Sea Temple, where someone had set up a domestic goods market, which was simple and unremarkable. Behind the temple was a circus that charged admission, with a notice stating "National Arts Division." We were all amused. Returning to the central tea garden, we passed a residence where an art exhibition was being held, with tickets costing six and a half silver dollars. Xia Shi showed a badge, and the ticket price was halved, claiming it was preferential treatment. The exhibition only contained a few dozen ordinary paintings and calligraphy, and even Sun Baoqi's calligraphy of a longevity poem was considered a work of art. Tourists bought tickets to pass the time, so it was perhaps a speculative technique. Around eleven o'clock, we returned to the levee, and the crowd grew even larger. There was a couplet at the levee gate: "Breaking ten thousand miles of waves, an empty alley of ten thousand people; coming in a single line of tide, defending a belt of dikes." The meaning was new, but the wording was slightly awkward. Beside it was the "Three Visits Pavilion," built by Haining officials in the past to flatter Qu Yingguang, because Qu had visited this place three times to inspect the dike project when he was the Governor of Zhejiang Province. I went up to the Highway Bureau viewing platform and sat down with Xia, engaging in discussions of the past and present. At twenty minutes past twelve, we suddenly saw a silver ribbon on the east side of the river, as still as if it was frozen, and the crowd shouted, "The tide is coming!" Ten minutes later, the silver ribbon gradually thickened, and we could hear the roar of the tide, rolling in from several miles away. Since it was inconvenient to take pictures on the platform, I quickly jumped to the side of the levee to set up my camera. The tide was not very high that day, but its momentum was fierce, sharp and powerful, enough to make people feel uneasy. After the first wave passed, a second wave followed. The second wave was not as neat as the first, but its surging momentum was even greater. The crowd watched until the tide receded far away, and then everyone returned home with a feeling of completion. I quickly got on the bus, and we returned to Hangzhou around one o'clock. The return journey was blocked by traffic, and the dust filled the air, choking our noses. After arriving in Hangzhou, everyone looked disheveled. I rushed to a bathhouse for a bath. Xia and Old Lan needed to go to the city to buy umbrellas, fans, silk, and cotton items to give as gifts, so I went to the lakeside park alone and took a boat to Gushan Island again. It was three thirty in the afternoon, and the lake was as quiet as a long summer day.</p>

<p>Episode Fifteen: Tears Fall in All Directions, Red Feelings of Sorrow; Hearts are Captivated, Lingering Green Intentions</p>
<p>Yuebinlou could be considered a Northern-style establishment, with all the managers and employees being northerners. Their service to customers was known to be attentive. Whenever a customer stepped into their restaurant, several people wearing blue cloth robes, like greeters, would stand respectfully, welcoming them whether they were familiar or not, saying, "You're here!" or "Long time no see!" When you finished eating and were leaving, they would also stand respectfully, sending you off with a courteous demeanor, saying, "Goodbye!" or adding, "Please come and visit us often!" All the waiters were mostly from Tianjin or Shandong. When you gave them instructions, they would always answer with a "Zhe! Zhe! Zhe!" Some say northerners are good at being subservient, but that's not entirely true. However, restaurants rely on attentive service, so people will naturally come. If you have a rigid and unyielding demeanor, who would want to see your face? Those waiters often made a high-pitched and drawn-out sound that made people laugh, and they also put on a comical expression so that customers couldn't get angry but would laugh it off. These were their special skills. Long Ziyun and his group often ate at Yuebinlou, so they were already familiar with the staff. When they entered, the manager downstairs would shout, "Fourth Master Long is here! Are there any seats upstairs?" The waiter downstairs would quickly reply, "Yes, there is!" displaying the air of a superior calling and inferiors responding from all directions. When they went upstairs, the staff would also consider the number of guests. If there were seven or eight people, they would lead them to a large room. If it was just three or four people having a drink, they would lead them to a small room, leaving the large room for larger groups. Some diners were familiar with the waiters, as if they were their regular customers. They would naturally come to greet Long Ziyun. When he entered, he told them that there were six or seven guests, so they led them to a large room along the balcony, busily changing to a round table and covering it with a bleached tablecloth, serving tea, melon seeds, and hawthorn fruit. They called that type of hawthorn fruit "red fruit," candied with honey. So they were busy serving the guests for a while before arranging the cups and chopsticks and asking the guests to order. Northern-style restaurants had several signature dishes, such as stir-fried fish slices with wine sauce, stir-fried shrimp, diced chicken with bean curd skin, etc. When hosting guests in Beijing or eating at a restaurant, each person would often order a dish. In addition to the basic dishes, the host would let each guest order a dish. People in Shanghai did not follow this custom. When they couldn't think of what to order, they would often ask the waiter to recommend some good dishes. Then the waiter would recite a string of dishes like a schoolchild reciting a text. Because they recited so quickly, it was difficult to consider the options, so you would ask them to recite it again, often several times. They didn't seem to mind.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Gold Standard Gradually Improving <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Highest Reached Eighty-Six Taels and Two Mace</p>
<p>Result: Increased by Two Taels and Five Mace</p>
<p>Silver Market May Look Weak This Morning</p>
<p>Significant Fluctuations Around Six Taels Yesterday's gold standard fluctuated again. Although there was some turbulence, the market changed by about six taels between the morning and afternoon, making it difficult to grasp. Foreign exchange was stable, with frequent transactions among various firms, but the mentality of the industry was still uncertain. Large firms were seeking more than they were supplying. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Shunli, and Wanxing all made purchases, while Yu Da, Fuchang, and Taikang Run sold. The market opened high in the morning, likely due to the decline in the silver market yesterday. However, at noon, news spread that Datong Bank was releasing spot goods, said to have been purchased by Hengxing. As a result, the market suddenly turned weak. With more short sellers than Hengxing, the price suddenly plummeted by more than four taels, falling below the 580 tael mark. Later, Yuan Cheng Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and Dade Cheng, Chengfeng Yong, and others actively bought, while the Dalian gang, Hengxing, and Yu Da actually sold, creating a seemingly opposite and agile situation. The price surged by more than five taels, breaking through eighty-six taels. It was also heard that Datong would no longer sell spot goods and was even buying notes. The foreign exchange market seemed tight. The silver market may look weak this morning, as market sentiment has shifted from weak to strong.</p>
<p>Morning Open High, Sudden Drop at Noon. The initial opening price for the December gold standard this morning was 583 taels and several qian, an increase of nine qian (the gross price was around four taels). The large forward contract had already fallen by one-sixteenth, and the silver price had decreased by one-eighth, then rebounded slightly by seven or eight qian to eighty-three taels, which was sold by speculators. Then, the Dalian gang and Yifeng Yong bought, raising the price by more than one tael. Huayi also purchased near-term British gold at 1.7375, so the price rose to 84 taels and six qian. It was then suppressed to around four taels. When the initial announcement was made, it was four taels and one or two qian, and the listed price did not change. However, Huayin Bank mutually traded January Citibank at 39.3125, and soon it rose to 84 taels and six or seven qian. Afterwards, January British gold was mutually traded by banks at 1.74275. Anda sold near-term contracts at 1.7375. As Taikang Run, Yu Da, and others leaned towards selling, the price trended downward. There were only a few small fluctuations. From 9:30 to 10:30, the market was relatively calm at 83 taels and four or five qian. Around 11:00, turmoil suddenly erupted due to rumors that Datong Bank was releasing cash, with the price increasing by 2.7 qian per mark, a significant amount. This caused general panic. After Fuchang, Yu Da, Hengxing, and Taikang Run made further aggressive moves, British gold was sold by Mitsubishi to Hua Bi at 1.7375. Fuchang and others also sold January contracts at 1.74275, but HSBC made some purchases. The gold price fell by three or four taels in one go, reaching 80 taels and nine qian at 11:20, but then rebounded by eight or nine qian in an instant. At 11:30, the market was still weak, with sellers following one after another. It then fell to 80 taels. At noon closing, the price was 8 taels and seven qian, and the announced price was still 619 taels and eight qian, a decrease of about 35-36 taels, or 39 taels.</p>
<p>Conflicting News, Rising After Lunch. The after-market opened at 82 taels and seven qian and immediately increased by one tael, largely due to active buying by Yuan Cheng Yong. It then increased by 1.3 qian, as Dade Cheng, Chengfeng Yong, and Zhifeng Yong eagerly bought. Additionally, the sentiment was very high due to the drop in Indian exchange rates. Shanghai absorbed December British gold at 1.73125 and near-term at 1.7375, which was sold by Ren You. Around 3:00, the price rose to 83 taels and eight or nine qian. Zhifeng Yong and the Dalian gang sold slightly, and the price retreated to 83 taels. Afterwards, January British gold was mutually traded by banks at 1.7375, and Yuan Mao Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and Dade Cheng continued to buy. The price was pushed up by more than two taels. At 3:30, it was 85 taels and six qian. Yu Da and others sold, suppressing the price by one tael to four taels and a half. After 4:00, Zhifeng Yong and Tai Heng Yuan continued to aggressively buy, and it was heard that Datong would not sell spot goods, which further boosted sentiment. At 4:15, it reached 86 taels and one qian. However, conflicting news caused the market to be chaotic again. Short sellers still had no hope, and Yuan Xing Yong and others sold, causing the price to fall slightly by more than one tael to four taels and eight or nine qian. At the 4:30 closing, the price was 85 taels and three qian, an increase of 2.5 taels compared to last Saturday. The market had increased by two or three qian. The maximum price for the day was 86 taels and two qian, and the minimum price was 80 taels, a difference of 6.2 qian. The announced price decreased by 38 taels to 34 taels. The registered price was 90 taels to 81 taels. The replenishment fee was 90 taels. The afternoon fee was 94 taels. The early market price for goods was 3.5 taels, the noon closing was 80 taels and eight qian, the afternoon was 1.6 qian, and the closing price was 50 taels and five qian.</p>
<p>Speculative Buying Exceeds Supply. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Shunli, Yongheng, Wanxing, Yifeng Yong, and others all bought. The entries and exits of Dade Cheng, Yuan Da, Zhifeng Yong, and others were erratic. Yu Da, Hengxing, Yuan Cheng, Fuchang, and Taikang Run all sold. In the afternoon, Chengfeng Yong, Dade Cheng, Zhifeng Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Bingxing, Chunyuan Yong, Fuchang, and others all bought. The entries and exits of Taikang Run, Tai Heng Yuan, and Yuan Mao Yong were inconsistent. Hengxing, Sheng Da, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuan Xing Yong, Yu Da, and others all sold. The entries and exits of small households were varied. The Dalian gang bought over 1,200 bars and sold 800-900 bars. The Guang gang bought and sold a total of about 1,000 bars, it is said.</p>

<p>Eastern Exchange: Poor Head, Little Trading. Yesterday, the HSBC listed prices for various exchanges did not increase or decrease. As the overseas silver market was at the beginning of the week, there were no cables. However, yesterday's cables were slightly lower, and the market was relatively calm. The domestic market seemed tight. British and American exchanges were the flattest, followed by the most tight at noon, then the market was turning stable. The Eastern Exchange showed "8" in the afternoon, as the gold market changed. British exchange was stable in the morning but tired in the afternoon, but the market rose high later and it was only showing fluctuations all day.

Banks such as Hua Bi, Huayi, Zhengjin, HSBC, Sumitomo, and Shanghai all absorbed the contracts. Various firms replenished tens of thousands of pounds, sold by Hua Bi, Anda, Hong Kong and Shanghai, and Macgregor. Various banks mutually traded tens of thousands of pounds, with over 100,000 yuan in bonus awards.

<h3 id="e151">The Yarn and Flower Market is Stagnant <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Yarn Market is calm. The overall situation remains sluggish, due to the large amount of inventory. According to a survey by Japanese merchants, there are about 160,000 to 170,000 bales, and the demand for cash is weak. Various parties lack vitality, so sentiment is poor. However, overseas flower and yarn markets have turned upward, so there is a shortage of selling pressure, and the market is stagnant.</p>
<p>The bidding price is based on the three-product standard. Although American cotton increased in the early market, market sentiment was scattered, and buying pressure was not strong. The prices for various months fell by two or three points, and then rose slightly by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 qian. The situation remained flat in the afternoon, and then rose again by 0.1, 0.3, and 0.4 qian. Because the price of three-product yarn increased by 2 yuan, the total trading volume for the day was 11,300 bales. Dachangcheng sold 600 bales, Changfeng 600 bales, Hengda 400 bales, Yu Da 450 bales, and Guangfeng 400 bales, with the rest selling 200-300 bales. Zhenda bought 450 bales, Rongxing 700 bales, and Suifeng 750 bales, with the rest buying 200-400 bales. The closing prices for the human bid are recorded below: Closing prices, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance, Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance. November 1457...30950, February 1479, Increased by 23, 400. December 1460, Increased by 13, 7150, March 1490, 43400. January 1472, 5, 9350, April 1495, 78800.</p>
<p>The selling price of spot yarn is calm. Spot yarn sales are still good. Various gangs bought 1,100 bales. The market is flat. Among the customer gangs, 215 bales were imported to the mainland, 55 bales were imported to Xuzhou, 345 bales were imported to Guangdong, 30 bales were imported to Changsha, 185 bales were imported to Shantou, 30 bales were imported to Hankou, 75 bales were imported to Luzhou, and 125 bales were imported to the Luo gang, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e152">The Cotton Market Suddenly Turned Bullish <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward. It was widely expected that the fourth U.S. government estimate would show an increase. However, the estimate was reduced by 48,000 bales, so sentiment was greatly boosted. Japanese merchants made large purchases, and the amount per bale was also significant. There was a shortage of sellers in the market, and the market suddenly turned bullish. The current amount of cotton at various factories is not large, and the source in Hankou is declining. There is no hedge selling, and the market is temporarily difficult to fall. There may be a small rise.</p>
<p>The Hankou standard rebounded by 0.4-0.5 qian. At the opening of the Hankou standard market, the market sentiment was still flat, and the prices for various months increased by 0.2 qian. In the afternoon, the price of Japanese three-product yarn and flower rose sharply, and Japanese merchants made large purchases, and the market was even stronger. The prices for various months then rose another 0.25 qian. The total trading volume for the day was 41,900 dan. Yuanda sold 3,100 dan, Hengyi 2,100 dan, and the rest 1,600 dan. Xingyuan bought 1,800 dan, Changji 1,500 dan, Lichang 1,400 dan, Jinfeng 1,300 dan, and the rest 1,200-1,300 dan. The closing prices for the Hankou standard are recorded below: Closing prices, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance, Closing Price, Increase/Decrease, Account Balance. November 3240, Increased by 20, 100500, February 3220, Increased by 50, 145800. December 3225, 40, 103400, March 3230, 40, 138600. January 3210, 40, 154400, April 3240, 3523700.</p>

<p>Bombay futures were slightly soft last week, with prices rising and falling with American cotton. Spot goods were very quiet, and the trading volume was far less than in previous weeks. Japanese and European exporters made some purchases in India, mainly Benji. European manufacturers gradually showed interest, and large transactions had already been shipped to Lancashire. As a result, mainland merchants began to become active. Japanese manufacturers purchased 16,000 bales during the week. China was quiet. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: thousands of bales). 1929, 1930, Cumulative receipts from September 1, 157, 158, Current stock at the end of the week 593, 404. Cumulative exports from September 1, 278, 362, Wheels to Europe 138, 94, Wheels to China 277, Wheels to Japan 125, 188, Other places 84. Liverpool spot sales were strong last week.

Afterwards, the market was quiet while waiting for the U.S. cotton government report. The U.S. cotton government report released at the end of the week was slightly beneficial to buyers, causing the market to be quite strong at the close. Egyptian cotton was generally quiet.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Grain and Rice Market Continues to Plunge <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, shipments from various merchants amounted to about 50 loads, but sales were sluggish throughout the area, and prices continued to plummet. Newly harvested *fuhua* rice was particularly stagnant, with a sharp drop of 50 cents. Special pre-orders were only opening at $15.50, and the general market was only at $15. Rice prices also plummeted. High-grade pre-orders opened at $15.50, while *yangxian* and *shexian* rice consistently dropped by a small amount, about half a dollar. Special pre-orders were at $12.50. *Bujian* rice also fell to around $12. Only genuine high-quality *kejian* rice opened at $11.70. The price increase in *bianxian* rice in both markets was due to the late arrival of shipments from inland areas. Therefore, future market fluctuations will depend on sales volume. *Bianyuan* also fell by a small amount, around 40 or 50 cents, with top-grade prices opening at $15.50.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, over 20 vessels arrived. Various merchants adopted a cautious approach, so prices fluctuated downwards. New *jing* rice from *changbang* continued to decline by a small amount, around 50 or 60 cents. Special-grade opened at $15.30. *Sutong baijing* also dropped by 40 or 50 cents, with sluggish buying interest. The highest price barely reached $14. The decline in the grain market here was also significant, with a considerable weakening of monetary strength. South Shanghai *baidao* rice also plummeted, with special top-grade opening at $15.12, a significant drop of 70 cents. This was a reaction to the previous wheat price increase. *Yangxian* sold at a high of $12.40, and *dujian* at $12.60, both dropping by about 50 cents. Sales were consistently poor across the board. *Yinyuan* had also fallen, approaching the $15 mark. Market conditions within the city were unfavorable.</p>
<h3 id="e156">*Kexian* Rice Prices Drop by 20 Cents Due to Sunny Weather <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the weather turned sunny, and *kexian* rice followed the decline of *duxian* rice by a small amount. After the clear weather, river transport of rice was available and late rice could be fully harvested. The supply of *kexian* rice could also be transported in a steady stream. Furthermore, sales in this area were slightly slow, with Xiamen merchants being the primary buyers. Prices of *zaodeng* and other types of rice each fell by 20 to 10 cents. In the Jiangxi *jizao* market, only about 200 bags were displayed, while the actual amount exceeded 1,000 bags. High-quality rice was priced at $11, with other grades priced accordingly. The arrival and sale of other *kexian* rice were both lacking. Jiangxi *jiyuan* rice (134 bags) was priced at $15.60, while Hunan *jiyuan* rice (50 bags) was priced at $15.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Flour Market Maintained Entirely by Manufacturers <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Slight decline... Improved in the afternoon. Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices for all months were reported to be slightly lower for foreign wheat, causing a general sense of fatigue. However, major and minor factories, due to having sold off a large quantity the previous week, were now taking a wait-and-see approach. Therefore, market transactions became relatively weak, and the decline was minimal. When the market opened in the afternoon, this month's prices improved because manufacturers were holding prices steady, while inland merchants were actively purchasing far-dated months. Considering the current situation, if manufacturers stop selling, the market will likely fluctuate for several days. As a result, this month's and December's prices remained unchanged, January and February improved by 0.75%, and March and April rose by 0.5%.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Wheat Market Temporarily Stabilized <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat futures market opened in the morning and afternoon, the prices for all months generally remained stable. Initially, the market sentiment was slightly weak due to the low price of foreign wheat. However, a significant amount of short covering occurred later, leading to price support for both near- and far-dated months. The standard price, in terms of domestic wheat, was considered to have fallen to a moderate level with no further room for decline. Domestic merchants with spot goods were preparing to stockpile and were unwilling to sell. Therefore, new short positions were scarce, and the market stabilized. It is possible that if the price of foreign wheat does not become cheaper and stabilizes, the market will remain steady. As a result, this month's prices remained unchanged, while December, January, and March each improved by a little over 0.1%. Spot wheat remained stable, with the majority of existing stock in the market being medium and lower grades. High-quality goods were scarce, and manufacturers were eager to acquire them. The medium and lower grades remained steady because of this demand. 2,000 bags of Kai Yaowan and Gao Xiang wheat were handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Sugar Market: Daily Sugar Continues to Open at 35,000 Bags <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's news from the production area in Cuba indicated that spot prices remained at 1.375. New York sugar futures for December were priced at 1.39, March of the next year at 1.48, down 0.02 from the previous report, May at 1.54, down 0.04, and September at 1.66, down 0.05. Spot Java sugar prices remained unchanged. The Association's coarse white and white market remained weak, with prices at 7 taels and 7.5 mace, and trading was declining and sluggish. Medium white sugar was priced at 6 taels and 8 mace and a half. Fine white sugar was priced at 7 taels and 8 mace, and buyers were scarce. Japanese sugar Z mark was at 7 taels, 7 mace, 3 fen, and 7 li and a half, J mark at 8 taels and 0.05, SH mark at 7 taels and 4 mace, YRO mark at 7 taels and 2.5 mace, and TR mark at 7 taels and 7 mace. Transactions were minimal, and the market appeared quite firm. YT mark was at 7 taels and 7 mace, and YP mark was bid high at 8 taels, but there were few inquiries. Although the Minghua factory had temporarily ceased operations, sales in various locations remained sluggish. The factory continued to offer 15,000 bags of Minghua sugar for January delivery at 5 yuan and 8 jiao, down 0.05 from the previous price. Meiji sugar also offered 20,000 bags for January and February delivery at 4 yuan and 6 jiao. Market sentiment was still buoyant. There was not much Taikoo B mark spot stock, and brokers sold it at 8 taels and 1.5 mace. The market appeared stable. Huaxin offered 2,009 bags of No. 10 Dutch red sugar at 6 taels and 5 mace. The sugar appeared high quality and had a fine, red hue, making it quite popular.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Wu Fu Spring Water Cleared Again <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of Jian Shui spring water has decreased, but there are still considerable stocks of ordinary Tong Shou spring water in the market. As a result, demand from lower-end channels is being outstripped by supply and the market is extremely weak. However, high-end Wu Fu spring water is selling as soon as it arrives, creating a counter-proportional relationship. A total of two hundred and tens of boxes of Wu Fu water arrived. According to customer opinion, the price should have increased, but because the lower-end spring water was decreasing, each line was unwilling to increase the price of Wu Fu water. They requested that the price remained the same. Due to market considerations, the house released all the Wu Fu water at 6 taels and 6 mace.</p>
<h3 id="e161">North-South Goods: Hunan Lotus Seeds from Hankou Suddenly Rise <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of Hunan lotus seeds has been scarce recently. According to yesterday's telegraph, the price suddenly rose due to limited stock in Hankou. Nine Creek lotus seeds rose 23 taels per shi, and Changde lotus seeds rose 22 taels. Including all external fees, the price was almost twice as high as the Shanghai price. Because the market in this area is sluggish, the market remains flat. Yesterday's market price for Xiangze lotus seeds was 43-44 taels, Xiaozhou lotus seeds were 40 taels, Hengzhou lotus seeds were 39 taels, Nine Creek lotus seeds were 38 taels and a half, and Changde lotus seeds were 36 taels and a half. If sales improve in the future, the price will likely rise accordingly.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign silk market in Shanghai was quiet. Due to the financial turmoil in Lyon, silk cables to Europe did not improve the Shanghai situation. European merchants adopted a wait-and-see approach. American merchants only purchased 30 bales of Sichuan yellow silk from the Jingchuan factory and 20 bales of Shanghai white silk from Huatong, etc. Due to high costs, merchants were unwilling to sell at a loss. Market sentiment was sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Milan Italian Silk Sales Sluggish <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Daily silk prices are low, European merchants sell at low prices... Current silk prices continue to fall by 3-4 lire. Although sales of Italian silk in the Milan market to Europe have slightly improved, prices are still trending downwards. Although Central European and American exporters actively purchased existing silk last week, the price of Italian silk continues to fall by 3-4 lire due to lower Japanese silk prices. The price of Extra Grade silk is 500 lire per kilogram, Special Grade is 451 lire, and Superior Grade is 402 lire.</p>

<p>Tea from the Lu Zhuang tea houses is produced in the various regions of Yuanyuan, Tunxi, Yinxian, and Suian. It occupies a large portion of the foreign tea industry. Last year's production amounted to over 320,000 boxes. Due to the mid-term termination of the Russian merchant trade, the market fell sharply. However, the existing stock was not excessive even when new tea came on the market. The tea supply from the Lu source has now been cut off. The total amount of tea delivered to the tea houses is estimated to be 255,341 boxes, a decrease of 75,000 boxes compared to last year. 150,668 boxes have already been sold as of the above date. The remaining stock in the warehouses is 104,673 boxes. The Russian merchant trade has significant sales, and Morocco has not shipped many goods, so the remaining tea should be easy to sell. The amount and stock of each tea house are listed below: Warehouse Name: Amount Delivered, Amount Sold, Amount of Existing Stock. Hong Youyong: 46,541, 12,249, 34,292.

<p>The cotton market at this factory has been stable in recent days. However, Tianzi Xiang cloth from Hubei has rebounded because of a scarce supply. This street has a daily demand of 30 packages, so supply cannot meet demand. Yesterday, it sold for 8 taels and 6 mace. 13-pound English cloth from Xiamen merchants was traded at 50 pieces at 6 taels and 1 mace. Coarse cloth was slightly soft compared to before, with three-yarn cloth opening at 4 taels and 7 mace, and Three Rabbit/Three Deer cloth at 4 taels and 7 mace and a half. Cotton cloth and fine twill fabric have been selling very little. However, Guang Bang merchants have been adding to the supply of Shu Bian Yu fine twill, which opened at 6 taels, 7 mace, and 7.5 fen. The existing stock of famous brand cloth is consistently lacking.</p>
<p>The market for East-West piece goods has become active again, with merchants searching for goods. Fine serge fabric is selling particularly well. Huxin Ting and Huanle are both at 3 mace and 1 fen, and Sanyou Tu is at 2 mace and 7 li and a half. 200 plus pieces have been traded between merchants from Changsha, Hankou and this street. Cotton thread has also become slightly firmer, with Fuhua Princess Color opening at 1 mace and 8 fen, Scarlet at 1 mace and 9 fen, Bird Beauty at 1 mace and 8 fen and 7 li and a half. Since the weather turned cold, the sales of bleaching powder from the door merchants have been very active. Double Child Deer requires 7 taels and 8 mace and a half, Watching Butterfly 7 taels and 8 mace, and Qilin 8 taels. Jiao Ye Ti Shu fell to 2 mace and 6 fen and a half, Magpie Bridge Meeting 2 mace and 7 fen and 2 li and a half. The Western goods board advanced another 20-30 pieces this street, priced at 2 mace and 2 fen and a half to 3 fen.</p>

<p>Yuan Qing top-grade tribute woolen fabric has been selling well in recent days. This is because merchants from this street have been purchasing it. The association's single and double sided sale prices are firm, because there is a shortage of stock in Shanghai, leading to a possible price increase.

<p>— Dr. Wei Zhong's Lecture, Notes by Yang Chuoran and Zhu Keliang</p>
<p>We are all like constables, doing whatever our managers tell us. We only know how to obey orders. Why? Because our brains are not good enough. Human brains are very inadequate. Revolutions throughout human history are all empty talk. Revolutions in history are not revolutions. It's just that there used to be an emperor, and then a few more emperors came along. The people of the Republic of China in history are all constables, revolting according to the orders of others. During the revolutionary period, they are still constables, still obeying orders. All the Republics of China, no matter which one in the world, are like this in revolutionary history. Why is this? Because human brains are too limited. Why are brains so inadequate? It is because, after thousands of years, there has been religion. How does religion diminish human brainpower? Religion severs the relationship between the natural world and the human body and brain. By cutting off this relationship, human brainpower is eliminated. This explanation is a scientific explanation because the human brain relies on the body, and the body relies on the natural world. Without the natural world, there is no human body; without the body, there is no brain. Constant use of the brain that has no relationship with the body and the natural world is sure to exhaust brainpower. Just look at bookworms: the deeper their learning, the more empty their speech. They utter many empty words, thinking that others cannot see the emptiness of their words. They only talk, not about facts. They cannot talk about facts; they do not understand any facts because their brains have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Now comes a very important part of the lecture.</p>
<p>Human brainpower has reached a point of complete inadequacy. If we know this, we can explain how [scholars] use any means to pretend to be intelligent. Those who are completely devoid of brainpower go everywhere searching for masks, using any means to prevent others from knowing they lack experience. They have never seen an animal but want to study zoology. The less they see animals, the more they want to study zoology. After studying, they know all the terms of zoology, and then others cannot detect that they have never actually seen an animal. There is nothing, but there are terms. Terms are like actors on stage wearing masks and pretending to be something. The inside of the mask is not necessarily what it seems, but from the outside, it looks very similar. Mr. Hu Shih once said that we should overthrow "name-based education." This can also partially prove that terms are the most dangerous masks for humans. For example, the more thoughtless I am, the more I use terms to conceal my lack of thought because terms come from books. The more thoughtless I am, the more I read books. If I didn't read books, others would be able to see that I have no thoughts, so I think it is important to read books. After reading European books, I know about Europe because the books prevent others from finding out that I actually know nothing about Europe. Plagiarizing the thoughts of others and gleaning the experiences of others to substitute for one's own thoughts and experiences is what reading is for. It means taking the thoughts of others to replace one's own thoughts and the experiences of others to replace one's own experiences; that is the purpose of reading books.</p>
<p>Therefore, people generally admire [books] very deeply. Thinking can be dispensed with, experience can be dispensed with; why not just use a little money to buy the thoughts and experiences of others? Wouldn't that be much more convenient? Using one's own thoughts to find one's own experiences requires so much effort. The body doesn't want to move, and the brain doesn't want to think. It's much better to buy books and read them, practice speaking, and the less you know about things, the better you can speak. Isn't that great? Isn't that much more convenient? Go investigate minerals? Too much trouble, you have to travel and be exposed to the sun, it's extremely annoying! It's better to buy a six-cent mineralogy book and read it at home. Much, much more convenient.</p>
<p>According to what was just said, since religion causes people's brainpower to be eliminated, they still need to do a second thing [to prevent others from knowing that they have no brainpower]: use books to make them seem like they have substituted their thoughts and experiences. Thus, under religious culture, most people never generate a single thought in their lives. They always have books to replace their own thoughts, so they are completely unaware that they have no thoughts. We can use an analogy to illustrate the greatest difficulty. For example, if I am sick and I know I am sick, I can be cured. But to be sick and not know it, thinking you are healthy—there is nothing more dangerous than that! Therefore, current young students just muddle through, going to class and reading books. Today they are students, tomorrow they are teachers. I ask them: [What is your brainpower like? What do you think about?] The person being asked will instead ask you: [Brainpower? What is brainpower?] They have no idea about brainpower at all because they have never used their brainpower while reading books. They have never used their own thoughts, they have only used the thoughts of others. They have only read books, they have never used their own thoughts, they have only used the brains of others. Now, education that requires people to read books is a way to eliminate human brainpower. This is very dangerous. Selling women to brothels is very wrong, but forcing men into libraries is even worse. For example, a prostitute's body is very ruined, but she puts on very good clothes, using external gorgeous clothing to conceal her ruined body. Just like a student has a thoughtless brain but steals very pleasant-sounding terms, using mask-like terms to conceal his empty brain.</p>
<p>This is the end of the first part of the lecture, [the relationship between current education and books].</p>
<p>Now comes the second part of the lecture, [the relationship between future education and movies].</p>
<p>The new education, the education of the scientific age, still does not exist in the world. Why is there no new education of the scientific age yet? It is because the scientific age has not yet arrived. But we are the people of the most important period in human history. What kind of period are we in? We are in the period when the religious age is beginning to prepare to transition to the scientific age. People who are now thirty to forty years old, or twenty to ten years old, are still people of the religious age, but the dawn of the scientific age is sure to come soon. Although scientific thought is very developed in America, the problem of the success of the scientific age is still not worth discussing. The education of the scientific age does not exist anywhere. We are moving towards education, experimenting, inventing, and looking for a path. It can also be said that we are creating a path because there is no prepared path. The scientific age has not yet arrived, so the education of the scientific age naturally has not yet arrived. Now it is just a hope, not something that has already been achieved.</p>
<p>The method of preparing for the education of the scientific age is exactly the opposite of the old method. The meaning of this scientific age is completely new: you cannot use your brain until you use your body first. Any activity must rely on the body. There cannot be internal arrangements without external stimulation.</p>
<p>As soon as this is said, one can understand why movies are so important in the new education of the scientific age. Movies constantly have the stimulation of things; there is never a moment without stimulation. [Without physical activity first, there cannot be brain</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>activity]. This statement can be proven in tomorrow's viewing of movies. Our sound film tomorrow always has physical activity first, then speech activity. The performance of the lead actress in the movie, Mary Duncan, is very high-class. Before she speaks, she has physical activity first. For example, when she scolds men for being useless and for always bullying women, without any limits in treating women, she pushes him away. Her brain and entire body express an attitude of looking down on men. Then she says, [You are all the same.] She uses her entire body to strike first, then she utters the words to overthrow them. It can be seen in the movie how these words come out from the body. Very few actors in the film industry are able to use this kind of performance. Her words clearly come out from her physical activity. Also, when she is on the boat, her body is close to Alleen Sohn when she says, "I should make you happy, happier than any other woman ever could." The activity of her speaking posture occurs even before the sound of her voice. (To be continued)</p>
