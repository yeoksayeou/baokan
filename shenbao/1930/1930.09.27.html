<h3 id="c7">德奥最近之政局 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>德國近年來棒喝黨之勢力漸盛自此次新選舉大獲勝利後該黨即有攫取政權之意政府黨中人雖有不願與之携手者然不與之携手則政府黨之勢力太孤决不足以自立今日三軍官之謀叛控案牽及棒喝黨之領袖其結果如何雖尙未判明惟可决其與政府合作前途大有關係如果此案而和平解决則棒喝黨必將與政府合作如果此案而决裂則棒喝黨必將盡力以擾亂政局結果有非使政府屈伏不可之勢故無論目前合作與否而棒喝黨之將來必操政權可預料也</p>
<p>奥國棒喝黨之勢力亦早具基礎此次政局之變動即因數月前棒喝黨欲任該派人物爲國有鐵路總辦内閣總理史科白堅决反對而副總理伏古盎則力贊其成因之閣員發生意見致有今日改組之舉也惟副總理伏古盎向爲内閣中極端右派之領袖而此次史科白總辭後奥王即任命伏氏組閣是又爲棒喝黨之一大勝利奥之政權從此歸於棒喝黨之手而社會黨之失敗不待言矣</p>
<p>吾人觀於今日德奥兩國之政局棒喝黨均大佔勝利此後難兄難弟之德奥不必再圖合併而邦交自更親密不特此也意大利與德奥近亦頗有好感今其主義旣同自然更易合作再進而與其他棒喝主議傳佈所及之國聯絡而提挈之則其勢力蓋有不可忽視者矣</p>

<p>共匪進城就放火同時又張貼標語及告示要「長少民衆努力參加暴動」來了這個「下馬威」以後就向商會勒索現洋七十萬元而美其名曰「贊助革命的捐欵」他們的告示上說「暴動奪取長沙解除無産階級的痛苦取消一切苛捐雜稅」但商會得了這個不繳欵要斬頭的勒索令馬上召集各衛圑會議除要求各大商應籌措一部分外全體市民無論貧富一律派捐房租兩個月這一來無力繳欵的人們也有自殺的也有被送到「紅軍司令部」的因爲不繳欵的是「反革命」呀</p>
<p>同時商會就以這種出錢的條件去要求紅軍司令部設法「維持省城的秩序」因爲一般地痞流氓乘機搶刧加以又奉了一道奬賞告密的上諭更是兇頑的很當時紅軍總指揮就很慷慨的出張告示「如有地痞流氓無故搶刧者斬」所以這一來刧掠商店的方式就不同了先由紅軍或梭鏢隊進店搜刧派持槍或梭鏢的守店門流氓地痞則麕集門外紅匪將好的財貨刧定臨去時大聲呼曰「民衆們快來共産」於是這般無形的紅匪蜂擁而入作第二次的搜刧了有時紅匪刦毁了商店還要將老闆和老闆娘子綁去用酷刑拷打逼索現金雖說多數店東都逃跑了便被捉去的也不少在這個時候紅匪並不是「擇肥而噬」的了祗要開了一間小店就是「奸商」他們的口號祗有「農·工·兵·」商人和智識分子都在被打倒之列</p>

<p>— 千里寄自香港</p>
<p>籌備已久之南北象棋比賽自華北高手周德裕林奕仙二氏抵港後即定期八月十一日開始舉行查此比賽會由華南象棋研究會主其成而華南象棋研究會之組織則肇自去年秋間由孔聖會中人發起一時奕界能手咸聞風起應該會自成立以來即醖釀南北奕戰之舉去年冬間曾假南華體育會之運動塲舉行人棋比賽與賽之人物初擬定華南華北選手厥後華北選手不果來始由廣州及香港兩地能手充數直至現在南北奕戰乃能成爲事實焉</p>
<p>比賽地點爲中華基督敎青年會大堂座位可容五百餘人門券一律二角另有連晚通用之長期券則售一元然連晚觀者不過三百人左右而已誠以好此道者不多苟非此道中人則斷難令其枯坐數小時之久也比賽時間定晚上七時半起予於第一晚依時到塲則觀衆到已不少舞臺上懸一縱横可八尺之棋盤棋子直徑約四五寸遠觀亦頗清楚大棋盤之旁置小桌與賽者用平常之棋盤就而對局毎行一子公證人按度高唱另由二人隨將大棋盤之子移掛以便觀衆秩序尙佳</p>
<p>華南選手爲李慶全馮敬如二氏皆年在四十以外李氏頂且半秃二氏之浸淫於象戲皆有二三十年之歴史正所謂已臻爐火純青之候者也李氏之著法以穏健勝從不肯冒險進取然以守衛得力失機者亦鮮馮氏原名澤久享「棋王」之名著法飄忽不可捉摸時或冒險進攻殺敵與被殺之差僅一步而已故常令觀者揑一把汗然馮氏之冒險進攻而不得手者殊不多見棋王之稱洵不虚也此外尙有黄松軒氏者藝亦與馮李齊名並稱爲華南奕界之三絶</p>
<p>第一晚之戰華北第一選手周德裕出馬周爲華北奕界第一流人物曾縱横數省未逢敵手者華南乃以李慶全與之遇揣其意以李素甚穏健雖不能勝亦當能保持和局免初賽即墮砘名也周貎清秀而舉止温文年僅三十許而已</p>
<p>七時半七届先由宣佈員某君宣佈開會理由於說明提倡象戲之原故時或引經據典不愧孔聖會中人演講時之腔調態度尤能表現學究氣象演講約十數分鐘觀衆頗不耐蓋渴望大戰之開始接觸也當李周二氏被介紹於觀衆前時衆大鼓掌</p>
<p>第一局之戰雙方進退均極審愼鮮有驚人之著法發現賽時九時十五分華南李氏以單車砲卒士象全對華北周氏單車馬卒士象全而成和局第二局雙方精彩之著法漸露周氏尤爲活潑接觸後至三十餘著周已去馬李已去砲之後周竟犧牲其車以謀殺敵觀衆初呈驚訝色繼而參透用意乃掌聲迭起此時李氏岌岌危殆卒以善守之故其犧牲其車去周氏之中砲以挽回險局厥後且以士象全砲二馬卒各一之勢比周氏之單車卒士象全占上颼此時周之守衛術亦大見工夫運用單車將對方之馬砲分散李雖犧牲一卒以去周之雙士到底因馬被困不能出全局遂不得不和維時已十一時半預定比賽三局以决勝負者乃將最後一局改期異日續賽焉</p>
<p>是晚除普通觀衆之外　凡華南之象戲能手如黄松軒曾得全港公開象棋比賽冠軍之鄧鐵如曾展鴻·劉壽彭·陳德沛·惰瑞生·黄章記等無畢集黄松軒與鄧鐵如且於座位之旁置棋子一羅按周李之著請而評論其得失曾展鴻爲南北象棋比賽會之委員長手執鉛筆細誌周李二人之署法馮敬如是晚示有比賽於座中與友低聲評判雙方著法指東畫西狀殊活潑同時台上之李慶全則自如至終目我未有須臾離開棋局而周氏則態度安閒於一著之後常移其視線以遠　觀衆　於此足見其造詣之深也</p>

<p>青年園地北遊印象  蘇靈　　（六）吹雪的都會　　灰色的天有如蒙着黑紗的寡婦的面孔淺藍色迷朦的太陽像是處女失神的眼睛冷風巡行着雪的碎花疏疏地在散落呵　　都會在顫慄着女人們的高跟鞋在漱滑的走道上用舞步行走生了鬍鬚的男人們的鬍鬚上和豎起着的高皮領上都結了冰霜我孤獨地在人羣中混行着心與腿一樣地顫震　　一向我是一個喜歡過都會生活的人在上海的時候雖然常年失業着毎日掙扎在窮窘的生活中但我却始終没有離開上海這並不是想在上海做什麽有大發展大企圖的夢我的不願離開都會生活是因爲那潛伏在都會裏的一種神秘的顫動的力引惑着可是我是甘願受牠的誘惑與牽引　　在大都會裏有着複雜的不同的各種「相」而大都會的中心又是那們亂動的衝突的所以我們生活在其中有似在奏着交響樂的座中　　也許有人會笑我袋裏空着甚或肚皮餓着還要在這樣肉的物質的街上獨行散步是的但他怎知道我精神上的獲得是有甚於肉體上的獲得呢　　在北行之前我曾担心着北來後要過不到都會生活了可是現在所感受到過不到都會生活了可是現在所感受到的這吹雪的都會是有一種異味的呢那們就是想要看的沙漠與黑森林不能看到但於我也没有損失了　　　我坐在走道旁大商店門窗前的給人們休息的椅上看着夜色漸漸降下了　　　天空由灰色而變成黑色了燈炬明了疏疏的雪的碎片仍散落着在街燈的光耀下有如白色的花的碎瓣的繽紛　　舞塲和咖啡店的音樂響了這聲音在雪夜裏顫動　　到夜裏街上的行人更增加了但我很奇怪這裏並不是租界或是外國爲什麽我的周圍看不到中國人呢　　的確中國人的寛大的胸懷是可以欽佩的這些大批的無國籍的白俄中國人也很寛大地給地皮讓他們居留｜看吧哈爾濱不完全是白俄的國度嗎那些大商店多半是他們經營的中國的無知的百姓們看到白俄「呵老毛子」地咕嚕着並且畏懼着是的在邊境的那些時時用機關槍大砲向中國擊射的赤俄不是和這些白俄生得一樣嗎　　蕪雜的思想侵入我的腦裏我在一個小食物店子裏飲了半杯渥特加想遣去思緒暖一暖冷的身子於是我醉迷迷地穿過了闊的街轉向黑暗的小道歸寓去慰藉  宓羅　　今天是星期日早上增兄來看我　　　秋風像煞已經吹來海上曾一度的把我孤榻上被單吹薄冷得我半夜醒來但是一二日來又長起了牠的兇燄顯然地擺出了老虎的威勢　　亭子問是向東的一早便有陽光照來誰再耐得住這裏悶坐我便同湯兄出眼向北四川路走去　　馬路上閒蕩了一會買了份報紙隨便翻翻踱到上海大戲院門前鼓動了看影戲的興緻　　「增蕩來蕩來去太無聊天又熱還是看看兩角錢的影戲罷不管他映的什麽　　「好的我請客兩角錢很便宜說不定有影戲以外的哲學可供老兄研究呢增說着笑了長長的髮隨着波動　　走進去没有多少時光一幕幕開映着觀衆之前因爲滑稽的成分很多不時發出烘然的笑聲但事跡似乎很平庸還記得全部中的一點　　「有一個老婦人靠了她女兒的得寵於女主人便跟着女兒一同居住很可以享些安閒的日子　過她有一件事情始終覺得十分悲痛就是她的丈夫已失踪早夕累得她對着像片呆望　　有時竟瘋狂似的瞎認行人了她竭力托人四處探訪終得不到實在的消息　　後來女兒和人戀愛戀人又是一個能幹的發明家在一切享樂上給了這老婦人多量的舒適她却格外的念她丈夫　　直至最後的死還狂喊着要去找丈夫」　　將近十二點鐘纔映完了我同增擠着人羣中出來黑暗了兩個鐘頭的眼睛一見太陽發着花睜不得開似乎見到增的臉兒有些異像我却不在意　　走得靶子路口乘一路電車回去方纔坐定他黯然地對我說　　「下午要剪頭髮去想拍一張照相」</p>
<p>Page 26</p>

<h3 id="e7">Recent Political Situation in Germany and Austria <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the power of the Nazi Party in Germany has been gradually increasing. Since its great victory in the recent new elections, the party has intended to seize power. Although some members of the government party are unwilling to join hands with it, without its cooperation, the government party's power is too isolated and insufficient to stand on its own. Today, the mutiny case involving the three military officers involves the leaders of the Nazi Party. Although the outcome is not yet clear, it can be determined that it has a significant relationship with the prospect of cooperation with the government. If this case is resolved peacefully, the Nazi Party will cooperate with the government. If this case leads to a split, the Nazi Party will do its best to disrupt the political situation, ultimately forcing the government to yield. Therefore, regardless of whether cooperation occurs at present, it is foreseeable that the Nazi Party will inevitably control power in the future.</p>
<p>The power of the Nazi Party in Austria also has a long-established foundation. The recent changes in the political situation are due to the Nazi Party's desire to appoint a member of its faction as the general manager of the state-owned railway a few months ago. The cabinet prime minister, Schober, firmly opposed this, while the deputy prime minister, Vaugoin, strongly supported its success, leading to disagreements among the cabinet members and the reorganization today. However, Deputy Prime Minister Vaugoin has always been the leader of the extreme right wing in the cabinet. After Schober's resignation, the Austrian king appointed Vaugoin to form a cabinet, which is another major victory for the Nazi Party. Austrian power has since fallen into the hands of the Nazi Party, and the failure of the Social Democratic Party is self-evident.</p>
<p>Observing the political situation in Germany and Austria today, the Nazi Party has achieved great victories in both countries. From now on, Germany and Austria, as brothers in distress, do not need to plan for reunification, and their relations will be even closer. Not only that, but Italy also has a good relationship with Germany and Austria. Now that they share the same ideology, it will be easier to cooperate. Furthermore, if they unite with other countries where Nazi ideology has spread and guide them, their power will be irresistible.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Wang Zhengting Reports on Recent Diplomatic Developments <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting of Nanjing held a press conference at the ministry at 11 AM on the 26th to report on diplomacy. (1) The Sino-Soviet Conference is scheduled to open on October 11. The scope of discussions at this conference will include Sino-Soviet trade and the restoration of diplomatic relations in addition to the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Therefore, the Central Government plans to appoint a special commissioner to participate. The selection of the commissioner has not yet been finalized and is being discussed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Judicial Yuan. (2) The results of the negotiations with British Ambassador Lampson, who came to Nanjing this time, were very satisfactory. The British Concession in Xiamen has already been returned, and it has been decided that the reception ceremony for Weihaiwei will be held on October 1. The reception commissioner is Vice Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the administrator is Xu Zusheng. The arrangements for the Boxer Indemnity have been signed by both parties and will be implemented on a fixed date after being approved by the National Assembly and the Chinese government. As for the date of exchange and publication, it will be announced by the Information Department after both parties agree. (3) The British answer to the legal jurisdiction issue is still under study. Once our new proposal is drafted, the British ambassador will be telegraphed to come south for consultations. The U.S. is still continuing discussions with the U.S. State Department by Minister Wu. The previous rumor that the tripartite conference will resolve the legal jurisdiction issue is incorrect. (4) Foreign Minister Wei Lide of France has decided to come south on October 16 to present his credentials and discuss the French legal jurisdiction and other Sino-French outstanding cases after being urged by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Various outstanding cases between China and France have never been resolved except for the tariff issue because the old minister was preparing to leave China and was unable to engage in negotiations. It is hoped that the new French minister will resolve the issues with a friendly attitude during his visit to Nanjing. In addition to hoping that the Sino-French legal jurisdiction can have results, it is also hoped that the three issues of the Shanghai Mixed Court, Guangzhou Bay, and the French Concession in Shanghai will also have satisfactory results. (5) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from the office of the League of Nations that Wang Chonghui, President of the Judicial Yuan, has been elected as a judge of the International Court of Justice.

<h3 id="e13">British Boxer Indemnity Deposits <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing reported that the exchange of letters on the British Boxer Indemnity has been drafted and submitted to the National Government for transfer to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. As of March 31 of last year, the amount of British Boxer Indemnity deposits was approximately £2,766,127. As of March 31 of this year, it will increase by another £413,127, with principal and interest totaling £3,179,254. It is estimated that it will be approximately £13,800,556 by 1945. The funds returned by the UK this time are those accumulated in HSBC since 1922. The use of the funds has been largely designated for education or as a foundation for the development of cultural undertakings. The remaining funds will be used for other construction projects. If China intends to complete the Yuehan Railway, the funds can also be allocated in advance. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hitler Testifies in Court</p>
<p>Nazi Party Parade Cancelled</p>
<p>Securities Trading Affected by the Situation</p>
<p>Unemployment Insurance Fee Increase Opposed</p>
<p>Leipzig, 25th (Reuters): The trial of three German junior officers, Scheringer, Ludin, and Wendt, accused of disobeying orders from superiors and inciting soldiers to plot the overthrow of the constitution, continued today. The most notable aspect was the summons of National Socialist Party leader Hitler to testify. The court was crowded and heavily guarded, and demonstrations were prohibited. Outside the court, thousands of people shouted "Germany, awake!" There were many women among the crowd. Although the police tried to clear the streets, the crowd did not retreat, so they summoned the fire brigade to spray cold water, and the crowd finally dispersed. Hitler testified in the witness stand that he was born in Austria in 1889, but had lost his nationality because he served in the German army on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918. Later, he became convinced that Germany's decline was due to its failure to use the inherent strength of the German people and its worship of foreign things, abolishing individual authority, adopting a democratic parliamentary system, and instilling the people with a concept of complacency. He believed that a new political party must be established, with party members who have patriotic enthusiasm and an indomitable fighting spirit and absolutely obey the leader. He also said that the National Socialist Party never wanted to use its power to oppose the state, but only wanted to break the intimidation of the intimidation organs, because the state could do nothing about it.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Reuters): Hitler's testimony in the trial of the three junior officers was very unfavorable to the stock exchanges in Berlin and Frankfurt. People in the market feared that Hitler's followers were carrying out their revolutionary preparations that were beyond the knowledge of the authorities, but the police did not believe this, only regretting that summoning Hitler gave him the opportunity to spread his propaganda. Hitler has canceled the National Socialist Party's parade on Sunday, fearing that the actions of party members may go beyond the scope and hinder its cause.</p>

<p>The Seiyukai's Dream of Overthrowing the Cabinet Fails</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Japan Associated Press): The 13th meeting of the Privy Council's London Treaty Scrutiny Committee was held at the Privy Council Office at 1:00 PM today. First, Chairman Ito reported that the report prepared by the two committee members, Ito and Kami, had been completed, and Kami read the report. Next, the report was discussed and agreed upon. The report did not contain any warning conditions, so no major arguments arose, and the full meeting unanimously decided to pass it. It is scheduled to be finalized at a temporary plenary session at the end of this month or at the regular plenary session on October 1st.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Dentsu News Agency): The Seiyukai was in direct conflict with the Privy Council over the issue of the Hamaguchi Cabinet's command authority arising from the arms reduction treaty and the supplementary plan. It was believed that the cabinet would collapse. Unexpectedly, the Privy Council softened, and the situation suddenly changed to the government's advantage. Therefore, the executives have now decided to temporarily abandon the principle of overthrowing the cabinet first and focus on local political warfare to prepare for a long-term war. They will launch the first attack at the Nagoya Tokai Ten-State Conference on the 28th and attempt a major leap throughout the country. The guiding principle is to focus on overcoming the economic downturn and severely criticize the government's incompetence and misgovernment to arouse public opinion.</p>

<p>German Speakers are Beaten</p>
<p>Armed Military Police Ineffective in Stopping Them</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (National News Agency): After two days and nights of anti-German disturbances in the streets and theaters of Prague, the Police Commissioner, under pressure from German-speaking cabinet members in the government, finally issued an order to crack down today. At the same time, the authorities also stated that there was no ban on the performance of German-language films and dramas, but advised theaters to suspend performances temporarily to appease the public. However, tonight the unrest continues. Rioters gathered in the Wenceslas Square, and anyone speaking German in the streets or in cars and trams was subjected to beatings. Afterwards, they formed teams to go to the German Club, smashing windows and digging up paving stones. The police were unable to stop them. Finally, they called in the gendarmerie for assistance and used bayonets to drive them away, but the unrest continued until midnight.</p>
<p>Prague, 26th (National News Agency): Since the outbreak of anti-German riots here, many rioters have attacked the residences of a small number of Germans, and there have been major clashes on both sides, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries. Many policemen were also injured. Except for extreme patriots, public opinion and various newspapers do not approve of the rioters and consider them to be excessive. Even the masterminds behind this action are unwilling to show their faces. Only the Liberation Party newspaper Slovo detailed that although those rioters are not all good people, the excessively nationalistic party cannot escape the blame for inciting this change. That party is really too infatuated with the dictator system.</p>

<p>A New Invention by an American Tobacco Factory</p>
<p>New York Report: Two tobacco factories here have recently invented a type of cigarette that can be lit without matches. It can be launched on the market before the end of this year. The method is to have a match-like ignition material on the side of the cigarette box (slightly stronger than the current type). Smokers only need to strike the cigarette directly on its surface to get fire. But there are two difficulties with this: one is to make the cigarette get fire by striking lightly on the cigarette box, so as not to break it due to force; the other is to make the ignition material on the side of the cigarette box not produce odor. However, both of these points have now been tested without any drawbacks, and there is no danger of the ignition material on the cigarette box burning the smoker's pockets. (World)</p>

The resolution was to persuade him to stay. (4) Resolved to issue a clear order to abolish the Labor Arbitration Council Regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e69">The Passage of the Northeast Army into Tianjin <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Cui Tingxian Efforts to Maintain Public Order</p>
<p>Jia, Xue and Jiang Arrive in Tianjin in the Same Car</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The details of the Northeast Army's entry into the pass to mediate by shortening the war and promoting peace through armed force were detailed in yesterday's letter. The army arrived at 8:30 AM today with three train cars, followed by a continuous stream of troops. Because there were still Jin army constables in the city, the Northeast Army did not disembark and enter the city. The details are described below. Tianjin Constable Commander and Garrison Commander Yuan Qingzeng was completely unaware of the Jin army's retreat and the Northeast Army's entry into the pass beforehand. Once it became a reality, he was extremely angry. As a result, he suddenly suffered from stomach pain on the 18th, and in the evening, he developed typhoid fever. He fainted once and was only slightly revived after emergency medical treatment. On the 19th, he also developed vomiting and diarrhea, and was unable to speak. His spirit was depressed, so Mayor Cui Tingxian had to bear the full responsibility for public security and troop withdrawal in the city. Cui, who has been in officialdom for a long time, can still remain calm in the face of major events. He arranged everything in an unhurried manner without revealing any panic. Public Security Bureau Chief Zeng Yanyi convened a meeting of the chiefs and officers of the five major districts and four rural districts at 8:00 AM yesterday (20th) to instruct them to fulfill their responsibilities to protect public order. At 11:00 AM, Mayor Cui also went to the Public Security Bureau to instruct the chiefs, officers, street chiefs, lane chiefs, and neighborhood chiefs in each district: (1) The Northeast Army's dispatch of troops this time is a peace movement, and it is benevolent. Local public order will still be maintained by the military, police, and constables as before, and there will be no accidents. (2) At this time of military urgency, it is inevitable that the reactionaries will try to take advantage of the situation and spread rumors. I hope everyone will remain calm and not be fooled. If there are bad elements who take the opportunity to cause trouble, they can be sent to the headquarters at any time for strict handling. Tianjin in the past is different from today's situation. Street chiefs and deputy street chiefs must also take responsibility to assist the police and constables in maintaining public order. (3) During this transition period, all organs of the municipal government and the constable headquarters have decided to continue to serve as usual. Before someone is officially sent to take over, they will never abandon their posts and leave first. In the past, when the situation changed, the new would come and the old would leave. This time, we have decided to maintain it to the end. Next, Bureau Chief Zeng's instructions briefly stated that he himself would be responsible for public security and would not retreat even if a knife was at his throat. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM and notices were posted everywhere prohibiting the spreading of rumors and disruption of finance. However, important figures in various organs who carried the Jin system color have moved to the various concessions since that day, their faces in a hurry as if a great disaster was about to happen. However, in order to encourage the serving spirit of the police and constables, Mayor Cui specially rewarded the constables with 10,000 yuan and the security team and police with a total of 7,000 yuan, and advanced the salaries for September of various municipal organs. The military organs also paid out the August rations, but they were Taiyuan banknotes. The previous night, the Jin army in Tangshan, in a hurry to withdraw and without cars to transport, beat the stationmaster. The railway bureau urgently telegraphed Shanhaiguan to ask Director Gao Jiyi for instructions. Gao replied by telegram ordering the rapid preparation of cars for transportation. The railway bureau then sent three trains. By 10:00 AM yesterday (20th), they had all been withdrawn. Xu Congzhou, the Chief of the General Affairs Office of the Beining Railway, called Director Gao to report to the chief of Shanhaiguan at 9:00 AM, reporting that the Jin army in Tangshan had left and requesting that Commander Yu quickly order the troops to advance. At the same time, a portion of the Jin army in Tanggu was also transported by the railway bureau in three trains by 4:40 PM. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the Northeast armored cars No. 1 and No. 2 advanced westward across the Luo River. Because the time was delayed by the station-by-station takeover, it was delayed until 3:30 PM. Three troop cars arrived at 4:00 PM. Also, at 2:00 PM, Yu Xuezhong and Gao Jiyi called Mayor Cui and Garrison Department Chief of Staff Zhu Xizhang in Shanhaiguan Public Security Bureau, saying that if personnel of various organs and garrison troops wanted to leave Tianjin, they could request cars from the railway bureau. Yu said that he had sent Lieutenant Colonel Chief of Staff Jiang Chunyan to Tianjin on the 102nd train to discuss the filling of the defense. Jia Jingde and Xue Dubi were also in the car, etc. At 8:00 PM, Cui Tingxian convened personnel of the organs at the municipal government to instruct everyone to serve with peace of mind and maintain it for a few days. Tomorrow is Sunday and they should work as usual. Wait until someone officially comes to take over before discharging responsibilities. At this time, they can handle the conclusion and prepare for the handover. After the handover, those who wish to return to Taiyuan should submit their names and the number of people to the railway bureau to prepare cars for transportation. At 8:30 PM, Director Xu received a call from Director Gao in Shanhaiguan, saying that if the personnel of various organs and the troops wanted to leave Tianjin, they should prepare cars for transportation at any time. All personal belongings should be allowed to be carried and should not be prevented. Xu asked Gao to come to Tianjin early. Gao replied that he was very busy coordinating military transportation in Shanhaiguan with Wang Fengrui, the head of the car affairs department, and that he could not come to Tianjin at this time because he was embarrassed by many things that were difficult to handle. It was decided to come to Tianjin with Yu Xuezhong on the 25th.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at 4:00 PM, the reporter interviewed Liu Encheng, the director of the Jinpu Railway Bureau. According to reports, the Jin army on the north bank of the Yellow River had completely withdrawn the day before. There were still more than 10,000 troops in Dezhou, who would completely withdraw on foot in about two days. The passenger cars of the railway had been requisitioned by the army, and there was only one locomotive left, which had been dragged into the Xigu factory and the parts were dismantled to prevent it from being dragged away by the army again. There are still five trains of troops between Dezhou and Cangzhou, which can all pass through Tianjin to Shijiazhuang tonight. It is said that Zhang Yinwu, the acting commander-in-chief of the Jinpu Railway, went to Shijiazhuang by car from Cangzhou yesterday. Feng Pengzhu, the commander of the 9th Army, is still in Dezhou.</p>
<p>Jia Jingde, Xue Dubi, and Jiang Chunyan arrived at Tianjin Station at 9:30 PM last night. Mayor Cui Tingxian, Garrison Department Chief of Staff Zhu Xizhang, Changlu Salt Transport Envoy Lu Jinli, Telegraph Bureau Director Bo Yizhong, Special Third District Director Wang Gupan, Public Security Bureau Chief Zeng Yanyi, and County Chief Shang De all came to the station to welcome them. Jia, Xue, and Jiang successively got out of the car. Xu introduced Jiang to Cui and Zeng, and after a few words of greeting, Jiang went to the Beining Railway Bureau to rest. Cui, etc., took Jia and Xue to the first-class waiting room for a confidential talk for forty minutes. At 10:30 PM, Jia and Xue left Tianjin for Ping. The reporter interviewed Jia and Xue, who said that the Jin army's retreat this time was ordered by Yan. The reporter also went to the Beining Railway Bureau to interview Chief of Staff Jiang. Jiang said that the Northeast Army would arrive at Tanggu and Lutai tonight, and would enter Tianjin in the morning tomorrow (21st). The armored cars would stop in Yangcun in the afternoon after departing from Tianjin. The army is filling the defense, and the area where the Jin army withdrew is the area where our army fills the defense, so the scope cannot be predetermined at the moment. Therefore, the takeover of the defense between Beiping, Tianjin, and Dezhou will be completed in a day or two. The order of mobilization of the troops for the takeover of the defense of Pingjin is as follows: 5th Brigade Commander Dong Yingbin, 6th Brigade Commander Li Zhentang, 2nd Brigade Commander Bai (certain), 27th Brigade Commander Liu Naichang, and 23rd Brigade Commander, originally Ma Tingfu, is now concurrently held by Yu Xuezhong. These five brigades all belong to Yu Xuezhong's 1st Army. After the 1st Army is dispatched, the defense of Shanhai Pass is replaced by He Zhuguo of the 3rd Brigade. Wang Shuchang's 2nd Army is also in the process of being dispatched and will soon arrive in Tianjin. Just now, I reported the progress of the negotiations to Commander Yu. My mission has come to an end, and I will return to Yuguan in a few days to report. (September 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Inspection Report of the Luokou Battlefield <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the Jin army retreated from the north bank of the Yellow River at Luokou, I wished to understand the situation of the two armies' fierce battle across the river for forty days. This morning at 10:00 AM, I again followed a railway team's special train from Jinan to Luokou for inspection. The train arrived at Luokou Station after fifteen minutes. After getting off, I walked to the southern end of the railway bridge for a detailed inspection. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Battle Traces of the Two Armies: On the south bank, our army initially defended the Luokou area with the 61st Division of Jiang Guangnai's troops, followed by the 16th Army and 73rd Division of Li Yunheng's troops, and the troops of Zhou Qiduo. The construction of trenches and fortifications along the earthen embankment was extremely solid. There was also a fort at the southern end of the bridge. The houses where the bridge guards lived were destroyed by artillery fire. Bullet holes and marks from gunfire were visible everywhere in the nearby houses and trees. The villagers all dug underground to avoid the artillery fire. Now that the enemy troops have suddenly retreated, they are all extremely happy. On the north bank, the enemy troops were the 9th Army and 25th Division of Feng Pengzhu's troops, and the troops of Huang Guanghua. Their artillery positions were on Meihua Mountain behind Queshan at the northern end of the railway bridge. The mountain was relatively low, relying on Queshan as a shield. There were three battle trenches in total. The first trench was on the north bank of the river, stretching about five li east-west, curving in a wave-like pattern. Behind it was the second trench, and the third trench was along the Yellow River levee at the northern end of the railway bridge, forming three lines of defense. Between the trenches, there were communication trenches curving directly to the Jin army's headquarters in Beiluokou Village behind Queshan. There was also a fort in the center of the northern end of the bridge, facing our army's fort at the southern end, both protected by barbed wire and burlap sacks. Bloodstains were still visible in the trenches, and bullet holes were densely packed.</p>
<p>Damage to the Railway Bridge: The Yellow River Railway Bridge is a famous and massive engineering project in our country. On May 1, 1928, Zhang Zongchang's army destroyed one span when retreating north. It was repaired and reopened to traffic in June of last year. When the Central Army retreated to the south bank of the Yellow River on May 30 of this year, they could not bear to destroy it, and only dismantled one steel beam from the first span at the northern end (each span has ten beams) and seven beams from the tenth span (the largest span adjacent to the water). All the materials were transported to Pukou for preservation (one beam of material was not taken). The bridge body was intact, so when the Jin army arrived in Jinan, they only removed seven steel beams from the first span at the northern end and moved them to the span adjacent to the water at the southern end of the bridge. Because there was no water under the bridge at the northern end, they used wooden sleepers to support it, and traffic continued as usual for more than a month. When the Jin army retreated north on the 15th of last month, they used explosives to destroy the first wooden sleeper and steel beam at the northern end of the tenth span. As a result, the Jin army's supply train derailed at that point. The Jin army then poured kerosene on six of the beams supported by wooden sleepers at the first span at the northern end and set them on fire, turning ten thousand sleepers into ashes. The rails were warped by the fire, and the wooden beams also sagged slightly. The stones under the bridge were completely burned into lime. The intensity of the fire can be imagined. Bullet holes and marks from artillery fire were visible all over the bridge. The extent of the damage was unprecedented. The emergency solution now is to transport the original materials, add sleepers, and first install them to support the bridge for traffic. Wei Jinglu, the leader of the second railway team, his adjutant Li Yuhui, and Hu Shenghong, an engineer from the Jinpu Railway, are currently working day and night to supervise the emergency repairs. Fundamental repairs are currently out of the question. The derailed train on the bridge has now been pulled out. Once the materials arrive, it can be repaired and reopened to traffic within ten days.</p>
<p>Our Army's Pursuit: Sun Tongxuan, the commander of the 12th Army, led personnel from the army headquarters across the river from Luokou at 7:00 AM this morning to supervise the advance north. The first regiment of Zhao Xinde's 59th Brigade of the 20th Division has already crossed Yucheng. It is reported that the Zhaowang River Railway Bridge north of Yucheng was also blown up by the Jin army. As of today, the entire two brigades of the 12th Army, the first regiment of the pistol brigade of the General Headquarters led by Gu Liangmin, the 22nd Division of Cao Fulin's troops, the 85th and 87th Brigades of the 29th Division of the 14th Army, and the 64th Division of Ma Hongkui's troops led by Ma Tengjiao have all crossed the river. Cao Fulin, the commander of the 14th Army, will come to Jinan to replace Sun Tongxuan as the Jinan Garrison Commander. Cao's artillery regiment has already arrived in Jinan and is stationed at the Xinzhuang Barracks. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">No Jin Troops Left on the North Bank of the Jinpu Line's Yellow River <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Han Fuju's Troops Will Advance Toward Dezhou</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Since the Northeast Army launched an offensive in Tianjin and Peiping, Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan have suffered major setbacks. The Jin army on the north bank of the Yellow River on the Jinpu Line, fearing their return route would be cut off, had no choice but to retreat north in a panic. At 7:00 PM on the 22nd, the Jin army retreated under the cover of heavy artillery fire from north of Luokou on foot. By 10:50 PM that night, there were no Jin troops in the vicinity of Luokou. At 6:00 AM on the 23rd, dozens of village chiefs and representatives of merchants from the Luokou north bank and Queshan areas came to the south bank of the Yellow River to welcome the Han army, requesting that they cross the river and advance north to maintain local security. The first regiment of Zhao Xinde's brigade of Sun Tongxuan's division of the Han army on the Luokou south bank crossed the river on civilian boats from both sides of the railway bridge at 6:20 AM, stationing one battalion each in Luokou, Zhao Village, and Queshan. The first battalion of Yu Huazhang's troops, who were the first to cross the river, were dispatched to advance north along the railway line. At 10:00 AM, Hu Shenghong, an engineer from the Jinpu Railway, and a railway engineer named Chen, traveled to Luokou on a railcar to survey the damage to the railway bridge. They returned to Jinan at 11:00 AM. At 1:30 PM, Dai Hongbin, the deputy commander of the armored train, also went to Luokou on a special train. At 3:30 PM, Fu Jianheng, the commander of the armored train, and Wei Jinglu of the Central Railway Team also took a railway team to Luokou for inspection. Both returned to Jinan that evening. At 3:00 PM, the pistol regiment of the First Army Corps arrived in Luokou on foot from Jinan and crossed the river and advanced north at 5:00 PM. It is reported that the vanguard of Zhao Xinde's troops had reached Yancheng at 4:00 PM that day (the 23rd) and are currently advancing toward Yucheng. The Jin army on the north bank of the Yellow River in Qingcheng retreated on the night of the 21st. Li Hanzhang's brigade of Cao Fulin's division of the First Army Corps crossed the river north from Qingcheng on the 22nd. On the morning of the 23rd, Wan Guozhen's 60th Brigade, Rong Guangxing's 87th Brigade, and Zhan Shutang's 58th Brigade also began crossing the river from Qingcheng, Qidong Taizi, and other places. It is reported that the two divisions of Qiao Lizhi and Zhao Mingyuan are also scheduled to cross the river in the next few days and will join forces in Dezhou within three to five days.</p>
<p>I followed Dai Hongbin, the deputy commander of the armored train, on a special train north to Luokou at 1:30 PM on the 23rd to investigate everything. After about fifteen minutes, we arrived. We inspected the Yellow River Railway Bridge. The bridge suffered considerable damage after the great battle. The wooden pile foundation of the first span at the northern end was completely burned. The wooden beam of the tenth span was bombed and broken. There were still several overturned and broken trains on the bridge. Many corpses and dead mules and horses had rotted and were emitting a foul odor. According to Yang Jinshan, an engineer from the Jinpu Railway in Luokou, the destruction of the railway bridge was all done by the Jin army when they retreated from Jinan to Hebei last time. There was no significant destruction during this retreat. As for the important materials such as steel beams on the bridge, they were transported south by the Central Army in June and are currently stored in Yanzhou. They can be transported here within a few days and can be repaired and reopened to traffic in about a week. (23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Fourth Route Army Recovers Liling and Liuyang <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the communist bandits' siege of Changsha failed, they fled in disorder toward Liling, Liuyang, and Pingjiang. He Jian, the commander-in-chief of the Fourth Route Army, immediately dispatched troops to pursue them on both the left and right wings. The progress of the past few days is described in detail as follows:</p>
<p>The Right Wing Army Recaptures Liling: The Right Wing Army consists of Li Jue's 19th Division and Chen Guangzhong's troops from the Xiangdong Bandit Suppression Command. They departed from the provincial capital on the 16th and pursued the bandits toward Liling along Datopu, Yijiawan, Zhuzhou, Banshanpu, Baiguanpu, and Yangsanshi, with Li's division acting as the vanguard and Chen's troops searching on both wings. Li's division pursued the bandits until reaching Baikaipu on the 20th without encountering any resistance along the way. On the morning of the 21st, Li's and Chen's troops divided into three routes and attacked Liling County. Most of the bandits had already fled to Youxian, Chaling, and along the old passes of Pingxiang, leaving only a small number of troops at Phoenix Mountain west of the city and the Yangsanshi Railway Station across the river to cover their retreat. They had not yet withdrawn and briefly engaged with the vanguard of Li's troops, including the detachments of Tao, Liu, and Wen, before fleeing toward Huangtuling and Youxian. The Fourth Route Army then recaptured Liling County at noon on the 21st. Li Jue and Chen Guangzhong entered the city on the 22nd. During the communist bandits' occupation of Liling for only one week, public institutions and the residences of He Jian, Liu Jianshu, Tao Guang, and others in their hometowns were burned to the ground. Communist bandits were widespread among the Xiangjiang military officers. The family members of all military officers with registered residences were kidnapped by the bandits, who extorted ransoms ranging from 1,500 to 20,000 yuan per person. The military officers were all in great distress upon hearing the news. According to reports, Zhu De, Huang Gonglue, Lin Biao, He Changgeng, and others fled to Youxian and Chaling, while Peng Dehuai fled to Pingxiang. There are two theories about the bandits fleeing to Youxian and Chaling: one is that they will flee to their old base in Jinggang Mountains in Jiangxi, and the other is that the bandits plan to invade Hengzhou via Caoshi. He Jian has ordered Li Jue and Chen Guangzhong's troops to pursue them from Liling toward Youxian and Chaling, while Ye Wenke and Guo Bugao's troops, along with the Liling militia, are pursuing them from Liling toward Pingxiang. He has also sent telegrams to the Gan army, requesting that they block the bandits in Pingxiang, Anyuan, Lianhua, and Yongxing, and to Commander Duan Heng in Hengzhou, ordering him to strengthen the defense.</p>
<p>The Left Wing Army Recaptures Liuyang: After the communist bandits' failure in Changsha, the troops of Li Shixing, Kong Hechong, Lai Ruchiao, and others fled back to their old base in Liuyang and Pingjiang. He Jian dispatched Luo Lin and Gong Bingfan's divisions to pursue them from Changsha, Longtoupu, Shuangxiqiao, Meiziwei, Leigongling, Fenglinshi, and Zhentoushi toward Liunang. Bai Shinuo, the head of the Liuyang Security Regiment, and Zhang Meicun, the commander of the Liuxi Farmers' Self-Defense Army, pursued them from Langlishi, Yongan Village, Jiaoxiling toward Liuxi. Zhu Xingshu, the commander of the Second Bandit Suppression Brigade, pursued them from Langlishi of Changsha via Jinjing to the north of Pingjiang. All of the above troops departed from the provincial capital on the 16th and have been advancing forward without encountering any resistance. Yesterday, He Jian told people that Bai Shinuo's troops had reached Wulidui near Liuyang City and would enter the city around the 23rd. The Liuyang County will be recaptured.</p>
<p>In addition, I would like to report on the statistics of weapons captured from the bandits. During the communist bandits' all-out attack on the province for half a month, there were two major battles. The first was from August 31st to September 4th, lasting five days and nights, and the second was from September 10th to 12th, lasting three days and nights. The bandits suffered more than 6,000 deaths and countless injuries. The numbers of casualties and captured weapons on the National Revolutionary Army side have already been reported by each unit and compiled by the Fourth Route Army Headquarters into a statistical table. A total of 473 of our troops were killed or injured. The numbers of weapons captured by each unit are as follows: (1) Luo Lin's division captured 2,007 rifles, over 500 spears, and 2 pistols. (2) Gong Bingfan's division captured 71 rifles, 39 spears, 9 hand grenades, and 5 bayonets.

<p>Changsha Correspondence: After the events of July 27th in the provincial capital, the people of Hunan generally felt resentful and unable to vent their anger after suffering such a tragedy. The Changsha Citizen's Daily had previously published an article by Hu Yiru, the secretary-general of the Hunan Provincial Education Association, and others, requesting the central government to remove the Hunan party affairs authorities. Tan Changkai, the propaganda minister of the provincial party headquarters, immediately warned the newspaper with an order, accusing it of being close to reaction. The newspaper has remained silent since then. Unexpectedly, the Xiangxiang Minbao published an editorial short comment and an article in the party affairs column on September 17th that expressed dissatisfaction with the authorities. The key points of the wording were: (1) that the severity of the bandit disaster was due to the peacetime painting of peace and hiding of the sickness by Hunan's military and political leaders, leading to this situation; (2) criticizing the military authorities for guarding the Changsha fortress and not launching a quick attack, which was a bad plan; (3) that the Hunan Provincial Party Affairs Guidance Committee members all hold positions in Beijing and remotely supervise the Party Committee, receiving salaries but neglecting their duties, often unable to reach the legal quorum to hold a meeting once every few months, which was investigated and reported by the inspectors to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters. He Jian, believing that the newspaper was run by the Xiangxiang County Party Headquarters, ordered Wang Dongyuan, the Changsha Garrison Commander, to send 20 soldiers to Xiangxiang on the 20th to arrest Tang Weiliang, Yan Ying, Zeng Yu, and Tan Zuwu, the editors of the Minbao. In addition to shutting down the Minbao, he also sent Tang and the other three to the provincial military law office on the 21st for interrogation. The following is the text of He Jian's telegram regarding this matter: Telegram to the Central Government, Urgent, Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Premier of the National Government, Tan Luhe, Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Hankou Headquarters, and Commander He Jian: I have been following the orders of the Commander-in-Chief and Director He to build fortresses and consolidate defenses in Changsha. The strategy of attack and defense is related to military secrets and has been reported at any time, but recently the communist bandits in the province have been seizing agencies and deliberately spreading rumors in an attempt to disrupt the hearing and hinder military action. If we do not strictly investigate, we will not be able to stop the chaos. According to the inspector's submission, the Xiangxiang Minbao of September 17th contained articles in the editorial short comment columns and the Xiangxiang County Executive Committee telegram in the party affairs column, fabricating military information, slandering the authorities, confusing the public, inciting chaos, weakening our morale, and increasing the banditry. The executive members of the party headquarters and the editors of the newspaper dared to be so unlawful, not only speaking out for the communist bandits but also plotting to cause chaos. I have informed the Provincial Guidance Committee and sent police to arrest them. He Jian kowtows.</p>
<p>Order to the Garrison Command: This army has been building fortresses to consolidate the provincial defense following the orders of Commander-in-Chief He. The strategy of attack and defense is related to military information, and outsiders must not speculate. Recently, the communist bandits have been seizing agencies and deliberately spreading rumors, so we must strictly investigate to stop the chaos. According to the submitted Xiangxiang Minbao of September 17th, the articles in the editorial short comment columns and the county executive committee telegram in the party affairs column fabricated military information, slandered the authorities, confused the public, incited chaos, and disturbed military morale. The executive members of the party headquarters and the editors of the newspaper are extremely unlawful. The Changsha Garrison Command is ordered to send officers and 20 armed soldiers to Xiangxiang to strictly arrest and escort the executive members of the party headquarters and the editors of the newspaper back to the province for investigation. In addition to reporting this to the Central Party Headquarters and informing the Provincial Guidance Committee, you must obey and not let them escape. (September 22nd)</p>

<p>Shensi Steamboat Incident: The transportation from Sixing to Xinzhuang usually relies on the steamboats of the Litong Navigation Company, with three round trips every day connecting with the Shanghai-Hangzhou train, which is convenient for passengers. However, a medium-sized steamboat of the company caught fire at night while it was docked at the Sixing Zhongshi Bridge pier yesterday. Because there were flammable materials such as gasoline on board, the fire quickly spread and the entire boat was burned down, causing transportation disruptions for the past two days.</p>

<p>Appeal from Huizhou People in Zhejiang Who Were Burned and Killed by Bandits: The Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association recently received a letter from members Wang Zanxun and Jiang Zhiting stating that they had received a telegram from Huizhou merchants residing in Jinhua Wuyi stating that the bandit disaster in Wuyi County was spreading, and the people could not bear it. The town of Lutan in the county is only a few miles from the city and has long been a prosperous commercial center. Thousands of Huizhou people are engaged in business in the town. In the summer of this year, bandit leaders Shao Zemin, Xu Ziming, and others sneaked into the county's Dagong Mountain (which is eight miles from the town and has a dangerous terrain) and posted reactionary slogans and announcements claiming to be the Fifth Route General Commander of the Red Army Guerrilla. First, they coerced farmers to join the bandit party and resist the payment of rent. Then, they extorted money and forcibly plundered, and if they did not get their way, they would burn and kill. The shops were forced to drain their resources and were extorted for three or four thousand or five or six hundred yuan, etc. After several months of extortion, they hoped that they could rest once their wealth was exhausted. Unexpectedly, the bandits' greed was difficult to satisfy. On the afternoon of September 1st, they brought guns and equipment and came in formation, poured kerosene on the houses in Lutan, and set them on fire. The entire city was reduced to ruins, and the situation was no less tragic than in Changsha. It was an unprecedented disaster. The Huizhou people who live in Lutan are now destitute, struggling to survive, and have no way to appeal for help. They will soon fill the gullies. They tearfully ask you to forward their appeal to fellow villagers abroad to help them and to telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to quickly send troops to Wuyi to thoroughly suppress the bandits and relieve their suffering. The telegram is urgent, and the tears are mixed with the ink. Therefore, we are reporting the situation to your association. We hope that you will consider the disaster suffered by the Huizhou merchants in the area and take immediate action to rescue them, and we pray that you will send telegrams to fellow villagers abroad to jointly urge the Zhejiang authorities to save them from danger. This is a matter of public concern.</p>
<p>Another Kidnapping Case in Zhouzhuang Township: The area of Zhujia Lake Jiangrenbang, where Zhouzhuang borders Qingpu County, has recently been occupied by gangsters from Pudong. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Defense Army and water police patrol ships have conducted raids and captured thirteen bandit boats. The defeated bandits fled before (the 25th to Zhou)</p>
<p>The three villagers of Zhuang Chenjiabang, Xu Lingeng, Xiuyilin, and Xiumei, were kidnapped, along with the three farmers' boats of Ye Tiuyun, Xiuyongfang, and Xiucheng. Price Increase for Telephone Service May Be Resolved: Zhao Chuanyu, the director of the Suzhou Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, received an order from the Ministry to increase the telephone rental by two yuan and immediately notified the General Chamber of Commerce to persuade businesses to comply. The General Chamber of Commerce repeatedly convened representatives of various industries to discuss the matter, but they all refused to allow the increase due to the current commercial difficulties. They repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Communications to request a postponement, but the Ministry did not approve. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce convened representatives of various industries again yesterday (the 26th) to discuss the matter and invited Director Zhao to attend the meeting. As a result, the representatives of various industries initially only agreed to an increase of five jiao (50 cents), but the Chamber of Commerce agreed to provisionally add one yuan per month to be persuaded by the Chamber of Commerce. The Ministry of Communications, on the other hand, was petitioned by Director Zhao to explain the commercial difficulties.</p>
<p>Mine Union Cadre Acquitted and Released: Zhou Wenhua, a 33-year-old from Hangzhou, was the assistant cadre of the Mine Union in the Zaozhuang Mining Area of Yixian County, Shandong Province. On March 18th of this year, Zhou Shengfang and other workers in the Zaozhuang Mining Area reported to the Central Executive Committee, stating that the members of the Mine Union had reactionary behavior. The Central Committee sent officials together with the Yixian County Government to detain the four members of the union, Wang Dajing, Yan Yucheng, Zhou Wenhua, and Zhao Yike. They were sent to the Army Department of the Military and Political Department of the provincial capital. The Army Legal Department interrogated them, released Yan Yucheng and Zhao Yike on bail, and transferred Zhou Wenhua and Wang Dajing to the Jiangsu Higher Court on July 24th. Zhu Wenzhuo investigated the case, and Wang Dajing was found to have no suspicion and was released on bail. Zhou Wenhua was prosecuted and the case was defended in the criminal division, Yellow Bingdao presiding. The judge gave a verdict of innocence. Zhou Wenhua was released on bail yesterday. Zhenjiang Warden Zhao Fengxian was also entrusted with handling the case, but due to mismanagement, two prisoners escaped from Zhenjiang Local Court Prison in early this month. The High Court sent Judicial Committee Chen Ludan to investigate and return to the court with a report. President Lin issued an order yesterday to Zhao Warden due to careless working, he was given a major demerit and demoted to a prison guard, and ordered to switch places with Jiading Prison Guard Han Yuwen. Also, Taixing Prison Guard Xiao Yu was removed from his post due to an escaped prisoner, and the vacancy was filled by Cheng Zhunqi.</p>

<p>Three Thieves Arrested in Connection with Multiple Robberies; Public Security Causes Concern. In recent times, robberies have frequently occurred in Wuxi County and the surrounding four townships, causing considerable concern for public security. Magistrate Pan, recognizing the gravity of the situation, issued strict orders to his subordinates to intensify their efforts in apprehending the perpetrators. The other day, Wu Zhengrong, the police chief of the county government, received a tip from an informant stating that Yao A'yu, a wanted criminal involved in the robberies of Meng Bangjie and Xu Peixiu's families in Yantai and Tuntianli respectively, was hiding in Dali Villa, Hetou Shang, Area 51, Si Touzhen, Fifth District. Upon receiving the report, Police Chief Wu, along with over twenty officers, including Wang Wenzhong, Wen Ziming, and Zhu Liangji, immediately set out by boat at 12:00 AM. Arriving at their destination at 5:00 AM the next morning, they surrounded Yao Guozhang's house (Yao Guozhang is the head of Area 51 and Yao A'yu's brother). Yao A'yu, upon hearing of the impending arrest, hid in a woodpile. The officers knocked on the door, which was opened by Yao's wife. Police Chief Wu and the officers entered and searched the premises, eventually finding and arresting Yao A'yu in the woodpile. Several stolen items of clothing were recovered, along with deeds and other stolen goods unearthed near a large pine tree in Zhangcun Cemetery. All were escorted back to the city for interrogation. Yao confessed to participating in robberies in Yantai and Tuntianli and implicated his accomplices, Su Meigen, who was hiding in Zhou Shanbang, and Dai Hongda, who was hiding in Yantai Zhen. Based on this information, Police Chief Wu dispatched officers to apprehend the suspects. Su and Dai were subsequently arrested. A five-yuan banknote with a circular stamp belonging to Xu Peixiu's family was found on Su. It was reported that Dai Hongda was working as a teacher in a private school in Yantai Zhen. When the officers arrived to arrest him, Dai was loudly reciting aloud to the village children. Yesterday afternoon, Police Chief Wu escorted the three arrested robbers, Yao A'yu, Su Meigen, and Dai Hongda, along with the stolen goods, to the county government for legal proceedings and interrogation.</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Commit Robberies and Assaults. In Kaihua, Zou Huangni, Tianli, a resident named Wang Gancheng, a former member of the education committee, lived a modest life. Unexpectedly, around 12:00 AM the other night, dozens of lake bandits, armed with handguns, knives, and clubs, broke into his house and ordered everyone to be silent. Wang Ziqi and Bao were seized and forced to reveal the location of their silver. When Qi and Bao refused to speak, they were struck on the head, causing severe bleeding.

<p>Dissolution of Mass Organizations in Various Counties of Jiangsu. Since the Central Government promulgated new organization laws for various people's organizations, all old people's organizations have lost their organizational basis. The Provincial Training Department has decided to plan to reorganize all people's organizations that do not conform to the new laws into legitimate people's organizations within two months. In addition to the provincial people's organizations, which were all dissolved three weeks ago, all people's organizations within the scope of the county will be dissolved within one month. The County Party Department will send personnel to take over and immediately carry out reorganization. However, the central government has not yet formulated regulations for the organization of farmers' organizations, so there is no way to follow them. Therefore, the county agricultural rectification committees and agricultural associations can only maintain the status quo temporarily. In addition, the industrial rectification committees in six counties, including Wuxi, Nantong, Wu County, Zhenjiang, Donghai, and Gangshan, are also temporarily suspended due to the large number of workers or complicated situations, and each association is responsible for directing the reorganization of various legal trade unions. During the maintenance period of farmers' organizations, the Provincial Training Department has formulated its work in accordance with local conditions. Generally, in areas where bandits and communists are rampant, the work of eradicating communists is carried out, and in areas where the local situation is stable, emphasis is placed on promoting the seven movements.</p>

<p>The Chen and Zhang Children Were Kidnapped and Ransomed. On the 18th of last month, Chen Jintao's nine-year-old daughter, Xizhu, and the son of Zhang, a widow next door, Little Mouse, were kidnapped outside the Dongguan Aozi Street Mao Gu Lu Chen Firm in this city. The bandits repeatedly sent letters demanding a huge ransom. It was recently learned that Chen received another letter from the bandits, and the ransom price was slightly reduced. The meeting place was still in Zhenjiang. Chen entrusted Qi Xu to accompany Chen's eldest son and Zhang, the widow, to negotiate several times. As a result, the ransom price was 1,000 yuan. Chen prepared the money and went to redeem them the other day. The bandits collected the money and agreed to hand over the tickets at Quanlou, across the river. Chen and others went as agreed and waited for a long time but there was no sign of the bandits. Chen's wife cried loudly, thinking that she had lost her people and her money. While many people were watching, the two children were suddenly discovered on a small Yangzhou Zhen short-haul boat. Later, because the two children were crying on the boat, the steward was investigating the passengers carrying the children on the boat when he suddenly attracted the crying Chen's wife on the shore. Therefore, the mother and daughter and mother and son met in the crowd. The kind of ecstatic scene can be imagined. However, the two children were extremely thin, which shows that the life in the bandit's den is different from ordinary places.</p>

<p>Wang Wumei Was Kidnapped and Escaped Danger. The other day, Lu Jiting, a resident of Changxing County, sent his relative Wang Wumei to lead workers to Yangmu Dou, near Yaojiaqiao, to collect rent. He was kidnapped by bandits, who sent a letter demanding a ransom of 150,000 yuan. It is now learned that Zeng Peiyu, the chief of the county's public security bureau, dispatched detectives to investigate in secret after receiving the report. It was learned that the bandits had hidden Wang Wumei in the Da Xiao Wu Mountains. He secretly dispatched a patrol team led by Tian, a squad leader, with three squads of armed soldiers and detectives. They rushed to the area at night and searched it carefully. When they arrived, it was midnight, and the bandits were trying to move the hostage Wang Wumei to Sian and then to Guangde. They encountered the bandits on the way and fought fiercely for a long time. The bandits were defeated and scattered in all directions. Wang Wumei was rescued from danger. However, it was late at night and the mountain road was rugged and the forest was dense, so it was not convenient to pursue them, so the bandits escaped and were not captured.</p>

<p>Two Mailmen Arrested by Security Team. At 5:30 PM yesterday, soldiers from the security team suddenly surrounded the Taihefang Post Office in this city. Several soldiers entered the office and tied up two mailmen, Wu Zhiliang and Wang Zhengfu. Onlookers were confused. It was later learned that a soldier went to the post office to buy five yuan worth of stamps. Because the receipt did not have the post office's insignia, the soldier returned to the post office to have it stamped. Because the person who originally sold the stamps was off duty, the person who took over did not know the details and said that he had to wait for the original seller to stamp it himself. The soldier argued with him for a while and then left. Not long after, the soldier returned with many people and arrested Wu and Wang. When the post office director saw that the mailmen had been arrested, he immediately called the county government. Because County Magistrate Li was out on official business, Secretary Tu Juyi called the corps on his behalf to inquire about the matter. Corps Commander Jiao replied that he did not know what had happened and would report back after investigating.</p>

<h3 id="e91">The Science Department of Central University Will Go on Strike <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>｜Resolution Not to Issue Overdue Salaries Before October 4th</p>
<p>｜About to Implement and Demand Financial Independence</p>
<p>The Faculty and Staff Meeting of the Science Department of Central University was held at 3:00 PM on the 24th in the Science Building. Attendees included Cai Bao, Wu Shouchang, Zhu Jianren, Yuan Ji, Jin Shuzhang, Zhang Zhaoqian, Wu Suxuan, Shi Jiuzhuang, Zheng Xuedian, Ge Bowen, Zhou Xueou, Zhou Jiashu, Ni Shangda, Yang Xiao, Jiang Tianhe, Lu Zhi, Chen Yi, Fan Huiguo, Wang Baoren, Zhang Yizun, Pan Shu, Shen Wang, Li Xueqing, Wang Jiaji, Zheng Houhuai, Zhang Zhengping, Tang Kecheng, Chen Jieffu, Yuan Jianqi, Chen Guangqing, Guo Yicen, Li Niuzhong, Jiang Zhichao, Cao Yuanzi, Wu Gongxian, Zhang Zhenqian, Yu Jieshi, Zeng Zhaolun, Liu Shuqi, Ni Zeya, Chen Hao, Qu Mengzhou, Yu Xinzuo, Li Zhichang, Fang Guangqi, Xie Pengnian, Zou Song, Zhang Yu Zhe, Shen Qingnang, Zhong Xinhou, Duan Tiaoyuan, Zheng Lanhua, Zhang Jiangshu. The department heads jointly elected Cai Bao as the temporary chairman, and the meeting proceeded as usual.</p>
<p>The chairman reported that the department heads had discussed the financial problems of the department, and that salaries had been in arrears for three months. Although a declaration of salary demands had been issued, the end of September was approaching rapidly, and the school authorities still had no solutions. It was difficult for the department heads to maintain their positions; This is the first reason. 155,000 yuan of the school's expenses were used for general construction costs, 156,000 yuan was used for general office expenses, and 157,000 yuan was used for public expenses. Expenses such as experimental school tuition fees are not included, and the departments still have to pay for their own labor, stationery, and fuel costs, resulting in very little money being used for books, instruments, and experimental materials. The office equipment fee allocated to the department only accounts for 8%. This situation makes even the department heads tremble and fear. This is another reason why the department heads are silent. The aim is to convene a general meeting to discuss solutions. Now, in order to maintain the livelihood of colleagues, what attitude should be taken regarding overdue salaries? In order to improve the department fundamentally and properly, how should the funding be improved? Please express your opinions and discuss them together.</p>
<p>Resolution Cases (1) If the salaries for July and August cannot be paid before October 4, a department-wide strike will be launched on October 6. The proposal passed unanimously. (2) A declaration should be published in the name of all faculty and staff of the Department of Science. The proposal passed unanimously. (3) In order to improve the department fundamentally and properly, the school authorities should be required to fully fund it independently in accordance with the methods used by the medical and business departments. (The detailed implementation method will be discussed by the department heads) The proposal passed unanimously. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>All declared that salaries have been in arrears for three months. Even if we can serve the public on an empty stomach, there is no way to fund equipment and experiments. We hereby declare again that if the school authorities still cannot fulfill the requirements of the previous faculty and staff declaration before October 4 (next Saturday), we have to let it happen naturally, sit back and watch the shutdown, and not be responsible. We ask for your understanding of our meager grievances. Central University Department of Science Faculty and Staff Qi, September 24, 1999.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education ordered the education halls and bureaus of all provinces and cities to order all bookstores to quickly submit all elementary and secondary school textbooks that have not yet been submitted for review to the ministry for review. The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry previously found that many of the textbooks newly published by various bookstores have not been submitted to the Ministry for review, and has repeatedly ordered them to be submitted quickly. It is now found that there are still few bookstores that have not complied with the order to submit the various textbooks newly issued between bookstores, and there are even more high school textbooks that have not been submitted for review. Such repeated delays are completely inappropriate. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is also ordered that the provincial bookstores quickly submit all elementary and secondary school textbooks that have not yet been submitted for review to the Ministry for review, and must not delay any further.

In the midst of difficulties, we have received the effect of revitalizing education and cultivating talents. Since Director Chen Bulei took office, more than a year has passed. With his public loyalty, he has carefully planned and benefited Shilin. He is grateful that he has recently been ordered to be awarded for his remarkable achievements. Now I hear that the old disease has been healed, and Lian Zhang has resigned. The thoughts of sorrow are eager, and the intention of clinging is even more eager. I dare to ask for the great plan of education to take effect over time. Dare to ask for your acquiescence to the public opinion and give comfort and retention, so that you can get used to it and seek the success of a century of tree cultivation.

<p>Wang and Xu Depart North This Morning to Receive Weihaiwei.  Negotiations on British and French Rights Scheduled to Resume at the End of October.  Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, accompanied by Deputy Foreign Minister Wang Jiazhen, arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 10:15 last night. Our newspaper reporter specially visited and interviewed them. The conversations of the two gentlemen are recorded as follows:  Wang Jiazhen Discusses. The reporter inquired about the Weihaiwei takeover, etc. According to Wang, the takeover ceremony of Weihaiwei is scheduled to be held in Weihaiwei on October 1. Except for Liugong Island, all properties in Weihaiwei will be taken over. As for customs and postal services, the General Administration of Customs and the Post Office will directly send personnel to take over management. I am only going to Weihaiwei to attend the handover ceremony as a representative of our country. After that, Commissioner Xu Zushen will be responsible for the administrative management. I will stay in Weihaiwei for about ten days and then return to Beijing to take care of matters.  Traveling by Warship. Wang also said that Mr. Xu Zushen has important matters and took a plane to Shanghai this afternoon (yesterday). I, together with Mr. Xu and handover personnel Zhu Shiquan and Kuang Guanglin, are scheduled to take the Fengtian Maru to Qingdao first thing tomorrow morning (this morning), and then take a warship to Weihaiwei. The remaining handover personnel, Ge Zuguang, Lao Weixiu, and Fang Zuchong, will take the Shuntian Lun to Weihaiwei on the same day.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting Talks. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting told our reporter that the results of the negotiations with the British envoy have been signed and resolved in three areas: (1) the takeover of Weihaiwei; (2) the distribution of the British Boxer Indemnity; and (3) the recovery of the Xiamen British Concession. The scope of the Xiamen British Concession is quite small. This signature resolution recognizes the abandonment of management rights by the other party, and our country's recovery has officially come to an end without the need for any further recovery procedures. Regarding the British extraterritorial rights, the British side has now put forward a new opinion, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is studying and considering it and has not yet replied to the British envoy. After staying in Shanghai for a few days, he will return to Beiping and has agreed with me to go south at the end of October to continue negotiations on extraterritorial rights. Also, French envoy Weirton is scheduled to go south on October 16 to discuss the recovery of the French Concession. At that time, if President Jiang has returned to Beijing, the letter of credence will be presented in person.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Mayor Zhang Sends a Telegram to Resign as Chairman of the China Merchants Bureau Reorganization Committee <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The State Council has decided to appoint Mayor Zhang and seven others as members of the China Merchants Bureau Reorganization Committee, and designated Mayor Zhang as the chairman. Mayor Zhang, who was on official business in Liaoning, learned of this news and felt that the China Merchants Bureau is related to the national shipping industry and urgently needs a thorough reorganization. He himself is the mayor and has heavy responsibilities. It is inconvenient to concurrently serve as the chairman of the China Merchants Bureau Reorganization Committee. Therefore, he telegraphed the central government to resign sincerely. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Urgent to the Nanjing National Government, I, Zhang Qun, was recently informed by the Shanghai News that your government has decided to appoint me as the chairman of the China Merchants Bureau Reorganization Committee. I am deeply disturbed by this news. When I first took up the post of mayor, I resigned from all the other positions I held, intending that a person with no talent can concentrate on one thing, and I am worried that I will be exhausted by one position, let alone others. In recent years, I have been running north and south for national affairs, and I have asked myself that there are still many shortcomings in the matters of Shanghai's prosperity and reform. Concurrently managing other things will only make things worse. Moreover, the reorganization of the bureau requires specialized knowledge and experience. What's more, your government is eagerly seeking governance, and there are still many talented people who have been wasted and not restored. At this time of comprehensive renewal of the political system, it is the time to employ talents without any restrictions. As the China Merchants Bureau is related to the national shipping industry, it should be widely visited by talents and thoroughly reorganized. My own presence in the council is not suitable for this. I humbly resign and hope that you will understand, Zhang Qun respectfully bows.</p>

<p>Nie Kaiyi Entered Sichuan Yesterday for Face-to-Face Consultation</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Chongqing air route, which was organized by China Aviation Corporation, was originally planned to be officially flown in early October. However, the test flight to Yichang, Sichuan, was inconvenient because Commander Liu Xiang had not properly contacted him. The Jiujiang aircraft had no choice but to return to Shanghai from Yichang. According to previous reports, the official flight of Shanghai-Chongqing aviation has not yet been scheduled. The date of the second test flight is also undetermined. The situation is still being negotiated with the Sichuan authorities. Nie Kaiyi, the deputy director of the Aviation Group of the company, took a ship to Sichuan from Hankou yesterday, hoping to meet with Liu Xiang in Chongqing. Therefore, whether the Shanghai-Chongqing aviation business can be realized as soon as possible depends on the results of this trip. However, no matter what, the responsible negotiators will not be able to complete the round trip between Shanghai and Chongqing in a few weeks, so the original plan to officially fly in early October will be difficult to achieve.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Explanation of Silk Factories' Opposition to Public Weight Verification <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Reply from the Bureau of Commodity Inspection to the Silk Factories Trade Association</p>
<p>Reasons for Opposition from Some Businesses Are Not Justified</p>
<p>Reply from the Shanghai Bureau of Commodity Inspection to the Committee of the Silk Factories Trade Association: "In response to your letter of September 21st, where you state that some silk factories have written to express their losses due to weight discrepancies and requested an emergency meeting to discuss solutions, a meeting of representatives was convened on the 18th of this month to propose suspending public weight verification starting October 1st. This has been duly recorded and forwarded. Upon investigation, the Bureau previously provided a clear explanation of the causes of weight discrepancies in a letter dated the 8th of this month in response to your association's inquiry, which should have eliminated the need for further explanation. However, we understand from your recent letter that some silk factories still do not have an accurate understanding of the public weight discrepancy issue. Therefore, to avoid repetition, we provide a detailed explanation once more. The Bureau, as a national commodity inspection agency, should advocate for fair trade on the international stage and cannot be biased towards either buyers or sellers. If raw silk is humid, it contains more moisture, disadvantaging the buyer. If it is dry, it contains less moisture, disadvantaging the seller. Public weight ensures an accurate measurement regardless of weather conditions. Therefore, the public weight system must be adopted for verifying the weight of raw silk. This is recognized worldwide and is a national policy. The Bureau is implementing orders from the Ministry and cannot arbitrarily change them, nor can anyone with personal bias lightly discuss them. As for the loss of weight, some silk factories have repeatedly claimed that they have very valid reasons. However, from a logical perspective, this is not justifiable. Whether or not there is a weight discrepancy in raw silk inspection depends entirely on the water content (汀) in each factory and the dryness or humidity of the weather. If the water content is sufficient and the weather is dry, the public weight after inspection will be more than the net weight, as evidenced by factories like Baotai Silk Factory, where the public weight of their raw silk is consistently higher than the net weight. If the water content is low and the weather is humid, the public weight after inspection will be less than the net weight, resulting in what is considered a discrepancy. In reality, the loss is due to the removal of excessive moisture that should not be present in the silk. Since the removed moisture should not be in the silk, how can the so-called loss be considered a genuine loss? Even if we disregard this, considering the advantages and disadvantages, factories tend to lower the water content during the summer months when workers find it difficult to bear the heat, exacerbated by the humid weather, resulting in weight discrepancies after silk inspection. As the weather gradually dries up in autumn, the water content gradually increases. According to statistics from the 15th to the 23rd of this month, a total of 824 bales were inspected, with a net weight of 82,465 catties and a public weight of 82,581 catties, 126 catties more than the net weight. If the beginning of autumn is like this, the situation in winter can be imagined. The period when weight discrepancies are seen due to hot weather and low water content is only about four to five months. During the remaining time, not only will there be no loss, but the public weight should be more than the net weight. Gains and losses balance out, so where is the loss? Furthermore, if silk factories do not seek excessive moisture and add sufficient water content during the silk reeling process, it can make the silk's color bright and clean, the pulling force strong and resilient, and reduce thread breakage, thus improving the quality of the silk and increasing its value, which is of great benefit to the silk factory. After the Bureau opened the raw silk inspection facility, the elimination of losses due to foreign firm weighing and other malpractices has resulted in annual benefits exceeding one million. Silk merchant leaders have stated this repeatedly. Where is the overall loss? The opposition to public weight by silk factory businesses is tantamount to abandoning their own interests. Why not give it some careful thought? Foreign merchants aim to profit from their transactions. Silk factory businesses claim that public weight causes losses, but at the same time, they say that foreign merchants still do not recognize public weight. If public weight is truly beneficial to the seller and detrimental to the buyer, why would foreign merchants, who are not foolish, not recognize a fair and impartial public weight system and instead prefer using the net weight, which benefits the seller? This is logically incomprehensible. The Japanese silk industry was originally behind ours, but due to the concerted efforts of the government and the people to study and adapt to the trends, it has soared ahead and far surpassed our country. If silk factory businesses are unwilling to accept inferiority and want to compete with strong neighbors, they should exhaust all their thoughts and efforts to gain the world's trust through legitimate means. Only then can the silk industry have a chance to turn around. If they cannot be pioneers and are unwilling to adapt to global trends, clinging to old habits without changing, they will only be eliminated. How can they compete with the world? The public weight system is sufficient to correct unjust gains from excessive moisture in raw silk and protect the interests of those with less moisture. It can be adopted in any country. Why is it suitable for Japan but not for China? The Bureau would like to further explain to those who say that public weight is suitable for Japanese silk but not for Chinese silk: Japan is the leading producer of silk in the world, followed by our country. Italy and France produce very little. Currently, countries like Italy are using public weight. How can it be said that only Japan uses public weight? The Bureau's public weight inspection facilities are designed to handle over a thousand bales of raw silk per day, based on peak silk market conditions. Currently, the silk market is slow, so capacity exceeds demand threefold. Inspection will not be delayed. Delays in ship schedules are due to factories failing to prepare in advance according to the specified dates. The Bureau cannot be held responsible. If Chinese silk merchants want to develop foreign trade, they should not only improve quality and increase silk cocoon production but also adopt scientific management methods to streamline factory operations, save labor, increase efficiency, reduce consumption, and improve profits. Instead of focusing on these tasks, they are solely focused on competing for unfair moisture content to gain undeserved benefits. What kind of thinking is this? Is this what is expected during the era of national revolution? Members of your association, leaders of Shanghai silk merchants and members of the Righteousness Committee, also served as members of the Bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Preparatory Committee, participating in the decision to adopt the public weight system. It is hoped that you will maintain your initial support for the government's commodity inspection policy and explain the aforementioned points in detail to the dissenting silk factories to avoid further misunderstandings. This year's Jiangzhe cocoon harvest was poor, and factories have been suspending operations one after another due to insufficient raw materials. Some people are now trying to use the suspension of operations to coerce the government into maintaining a public weight system that ensures fair raw silk trade. Wouldn't that make them a laughingstock to the world? Members of your association, with a clear understanding of the modern silk trade trends, should not support this proposal. It is hoped that you will guide them well and avoid bringing trouble upon yourselves. Regarding the inability to justify the opposition to public weight by some silk factories and the raw silk inspection public weight system being a policy set by the government that the Bureau cannot arbitrarily change, nor can it submit opinions based on a lack of understanding. If some silk factories insist on their views, they should directly submit them to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for review. This is the reply to your association. We hope you will take note."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Incident of Dutch Citizens Insulting a Chinese Woman <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Telegram from the Overseas Chinese Association to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Advancement Association sent a special telegram to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Central Government in Nanjing and the Ministry of Education regarding the incident of the first and second mates of the Dutch ship "Tjisedane" forcibly molesting Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a Chinese teacher hired by the Huaqiao Peide School in Ambon Island, Dutch East Indies. The telegram read: "To the esteemed Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, today's newspapers reported that Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a teacher hired by the Huaqiao Peide School in Ambon Island, Dutch East Indies, boarded the "Tjisedane" of the Java-China-Japan Lijn shipping company on August 14th. Before the ship reached its destination, she was repeatedly molested by the Dutch first and second mates. When Chinese passengers on board questioned the captain, he colluded with the ship's doctor to hastily diagnose her as having a mental illness. According to Ms. Xiao's own account of the molestation, the evidence is conclusive. The fact that the ship's doctor and others are trying to shirk responsibility suggests that they have been molesting Chinese women traveling to the Dutch East Indies for a long time, taking advantage of their silence. Although the incident has aroused sympathy and support from the Chinese community in Makassar, we are concerned that under the shadow of imperialism, it may not achieve any results. The association believes that this incident not only insults Ms. Xiao but also our entire nation. Therefore, we urgently appeal to the Commission to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a serious protest with the Dutch government and the consul in Ambon Island. If the Dutch government indulges in such actions, we request the Commission to consider further measures and not make any concessions to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future. This is to prevent Chinese women traveling abroad, especially those hired as teachers in overseas Chinese schools, from being apprehensive. If this case is won, not only will the victim's grievances be redressed, but our entire nation can also vent its anger. In anticipation, we await your instructions with utmost urgency. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Advancement Association respectfully submits."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Second Report on Epidemic Diseases from the Quarantine Office <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The National Maritime Quarantine Office of the Ministry of Health released its second report on cholera and plague yesterday: (Cholera) There are still several new cases of cholera in Shanghai every day. Out of the 49 people reported in the first report, 4 died. Since then, 42 new cases have occurred, with 6 deaths. From August 28th, there have been a total of 87 cases of cholera, with 11 deaths. Among those infected with cholera, several came from Suzhou and Hangzhou. In one family, all members were infected within five days. The government is currently investigating the source of the disease. (Plague) Since the last report was released, this office has received information about the plague in Tongliao, Northeast China. A detailed report is as follows: In early August, several Mongolians contracted bubonic plague and died. Subsequently, 45 Chinese cavalry soldiers in Tongliao also contracted the same disease and died. The Quarantine Office of the Eastern Provinces dispatched personnel to investigate and found the following results: (1) (Xinnailitun) 11 deaths from the disease; (2) (Tuquan) 12 deaths from the disease; (3) (A small village in Kaitong) 6 deaths from the disease; (4) (Kongjiatun) 30 infected cases; (5) (Gaoluosi in Inner Mongolia) 30 infected cases; (6) (Small villages near Tongliao) 1 infected case. The same disease may have occurred in other areas as well, but due to recent floods, it is difficult to conduct a thorough investigation. However, as the weather is getting colder, it is expected that the bubonic plague will gradually decrease. Since the disease is entirely transmitted by rat fleas, and there are now fewer rats, rat fleas will not cause much harm. We recently received a telegram from Fenyang, Shanxi, reporting that plague has also been found in Suide, Shaanxi. According to the most noteworthy information about the plague this year, the regions of Eastern and Western Siberia, which suffered from severe muskrat plague in 1910 and 1920, have not experienced any plague outbreaks this year. It is expected that the ten-year cycle of muskrat plague will be safely passed in 1930 without any outbreaks. This is because the cat-like muskrats produced in that area are very healthy this year. If the muskrats are not infected, they will naturally not transmit the disease to humans."</p>

<p>More Than Ten Men and Women Drowned</p>
<p>The Dingxing and Ruifeng sandbanks outside Wusongkou are located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, making them particularly dangerous during autumn high tides. On the night before last, around 11:30 PM, a sudden gale and tidal surge, combined with rough waves, destroyed the dikes along the coast of the two sandbanks, turning them into a swamp in an instant. Residents were asleep at the time and were awakened from their dreams by the commotion. They climbed onto roofs or trees to temporarily escape. Cries for help were incessant. After about two hours, the tide gradually receded. By daybreak, it was discovered that more than ten men, women, and children had drowned. The bodies were swept away with the receding tide and could not be recovered. Most of the furniture and appliances in the residents' homes were washed away or scattered in disarray. The rice harvested by the farmers was also washed away. The residents of the sandbanks, facing this disaster with no means to recover, presented the incident to the Baoshan County government, requesting that officials be sent to investigate the disaster and that the landowners be immediately notified to provide funds to repair the destroyed dikes to reinforce the embankments and prevent future disasters.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Important News on Yangtze River Shipping <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>2.5 Million Yuan in Cash Transported to Hankou</p>
<p>Hankou needs cash to facilitate business and commerce. The Shanghai banks agreed to purchase foreign exchange and transport it. The British ship company agreed to transport the money in batches each day, a total of 2.5 million yuan, before the lunar Mid-Autumn Festival. In order to ensure safety, the British ship company specially requested the British warship to escort the ships all the way upstream.</p>
<p>Pukou Surcharge: Due to the berthing of military transport ships at the docks of various shipping companies, goods shipped from Shanghai to Pukou are now transferred to barges, resulting in significant costs. Taikoo, Ewo, Nissin, and other shipping companies in Shanghai had already increased the freight rate by 15%. Yesterday, another meeting was held to discuss that the increased freight rate was still not enough to cover the barging costs. It was decided that from October 1st, the freight rate for goods exported from Pukou would be increased by another 15%. The original rate of five taels of silver per ton for general cargo will now be increased to six taels and five mace. The increase has already been notified to various shippers.</p>
<p>New Ship Inaugural Voyage: The Ewo shipping company has built a new ship, "Baohua," in Shanghai, which is dedicated to the Shanghai-Yichang route. The installation of passenger seats has been completed recently. The company has decided that the inaugural voyage to Yichang will be on October 4th. The ship uses a diesel engine and has a very high speed. It is the newest type of fast ship on the Yangtze River. If it travels directly, it can reach Shanghai to Hankou in 24 hours. After this ship starts operating, the "Jianghe" ship will be reassigned to the Hankou-Yichang route and will no longer come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Cloth: The most important goods for export to the upper Yangtze River are cotton yarn and cloth. As autumn is approaching and the water level of the upper Yangtze River will soon recede, ships over a thousand tons will not be able to navigate to the Sichuan River. Therefore, the Chongqing and Yichang shippers are rushing to export the purchased cotton yarn and cloth. Because in three weeks, the large ships on the Shanghai-Yichang route will not be able to sail. Each day, at least 1,500 to 2,000 pieces of yarn are exported by Jianglun. Of the six companies, Nissin has transported the most. In this month alone, in these twenty days, more than 40,000 pieces have been shipped out. There are still over 10,000 pieces being loaded.</p>
<p>Resumption of Chinese Ships: The number of Chinese merchant ships on the Yangtze River has been gradually increasing since last week. The ships that are currently operating on the Shanghai-Hankou route include "Jiangshun," "Jianghua," "Jiang'an," "Jiangxin," "Jianguo," "Jiangjing," "Ningshao," "Zhaoxing," "Rongxing," "Xin Ningxing," "Longshan," and "Hengshan." On the upper Yangtze River (Yichang route) are "Kuaili," "Hongyuan," and "Hongheng." On the Chongqing route is the "Wuxing" ship. The "Emei" ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also been repaired and will be able to go to Chongqing soon. The ships that have been suspended and will soon resume operations include "Changan" and "Jiangyu." The ships that have not yet resumed operations due to various reasons include "Fulong," "Fengpu," "Changxing," "Jiangtian," and "Dexing."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Letter from the Citizens' Association to the Five Directors Regarding the Water Price Increase <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>To: Yuan Ludeng, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Xinliu, Hu Mengjia, and other five Chinese Directors</p>
<p>Regarding the water price increase:</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, We, the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation, are writing to you regarding the recent case of the public concession's water price increase. The Property Owners' Association and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association have repeatedly protested to the Water Company and negotiated with the Public Works Department, sending letters to argue forcefully. However, according to reports, the Public Works Department, at its board meeting held on the 17th of this month, formally approved the 25% water price increase and decided to implement it on October 1st of this year. We are astonished upon reading this. As directors, we did not hear you express any opinions or take any actions at the time. Could it be that you also believe that the water price increase is justified and therefore agreed to it? As renowned figures of this generation, caring for the people as if they were your own children, how can you seek benefits for the citizens and live up to the trust placed in you? Not only that, but regarding the various unfair cases of the Public Works Department treating the Chinese people, you have all remained silent and have not been heard to protest. The citizens' expectations of you have turned from hope to disappointment. Now, let us compare you with the Japanese directors. The Japanese directors occupy only two seats on the Public Works Department board, but they strive to protect the interests of their fellow countrymen in Shanghai. They can be said to be fulfilling their duties to the utmost. Although we occupy five seats, in reality, it is as if we have none. You are ashamed of public opinion and feel guilty in your conscience. How will you explain yourselves? Our Association cannot bear to see you fall into injustice. On behalf of all the citizens, we urge you to do three things: (1) Pay attention to the suffering of the citizens due to unequal treatment and seek to help them. (2) Regarding public construction projects within the concession, you should absolutely protect the interests of the Chinese people and exercise your powers as directors. (3) Regarding the unresolved Chinese cases within the concession, you should be responsible for urging the Public Works Department to resolve them as soon as possible. The above three points are related to the vital interests of the citizens and cannot be ignored for a single day. We hope that you will not be intimidated by the powerful and bear the heavy burden, lest you fail to fulfill your duties and cause many things to go wrong. The citizens have great expectations for you.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Subsidy for Cotton Weaving Industry Difficult to Allocate for Now <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Further Consideration Pending Adequate Ministry Funds</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday received an instruction from the Executive Yuan: "Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Government's request for the government to allocate a subsidy to alleviate the decline of the city's mercerized cotton weaving industry, the Executive Yuan was instructed to investigate and handle the matter. After ordering the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Finance to investigate and handle the matter, the Ministry of Finance reported that the decline of domestic industry has indeed been a reality in recent years, not just in Shanghai and not just in the mercerized cotton weaving industry. If the national treasury is capable, a subsidy should be considered. However, with the military situation still unsettled and the expenditure of national funds being twice as high as before, there are no remaining funds to allocate for subsidies. Furthermore, the demobilization or troop reduction bonds requested in the original petition have already been fully used and there is no way to raise funds. It seems that the subsidy requested by the Municipal Government should be considered when the Ministry's funds are sufficient." The response was approved as suggested. In addition to submitting a report and instructing the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Municipal Government was also instructed to inform the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. We hear that the Municipal Government has instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to inform the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for their information.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Cigarette Bonds Still Should Be Collected Jointly <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Coal Industry Association</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday wrote to the Coal Industry Association: "In response to your previous letter stating that the Coal Bureau intended to jointly collect 19-year cigarette bonds for the special tax, and requesting that the Coal Industry Association subscribe to them instead, we immediately submitted the situation to the Shanghai Municipal Government for review. We have now received Instruction No. 5795, which states: 'Inform the parties concerned that the Ministry of Finance's reply No. 14777 states that the Municipal Government's consultation on the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's request to abolish the Coal Bureau's joint collection of 19-year cigarette bonds and replace it with subscription by the Coal Industry Association has been rejected. The Ministry stated that the funds raised in this offering of bonds are to be used to replenish the national treasury and meet urgent needs. All merchants and citizens should actively subscribe to fulfill their national obligations. Furthermore, the bond's fund is secure, the term is short, and the interest is high. Subscribers are acting generously and selflessly, and there is no reason for them to decline. The request cannot be approved.' The Jiangsu Financial Commissioner was instructed to promptly instruct the Coal Bureau to handle the matter carefully and issue formal receipts to avoid any excuses. This case was previously submitted to the Bureau by the Chamber of Commerce for handling. The approval was granted to the consultation previously made. In addition to issuing separate instructions, it is hereby instructed that the matter be immediately informed for reference (New Sound Society)."</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Continues to Request Revision of Import Tariff on Cowhides <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Request to the Ministry of Finance via Telegraph</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday to continue requesting a revision of the import tariff on red tanned cowhides. The original telegram stated: "The red tanned cowhide industry has requested a revision of the import tariff rules to maintain its operations. In August of this year, we submitted the request and it was approved by you for forwarding to the National Tariff Commission for consideration when revising the new tariff rules in order to maintain the interests of overseas Chinese merchants, etc. It was recorded that the approval was forwarded for notification. The Red Tanned Cowhide Industry Association has now written to state that the Ministry's order to forward the request to the National Tariff Commission for consideration is too remote and uncertain. The increase or decrease in the red tanned cowhide tariff is of utmost importance to the leather industry in Southeast Asia and this city. If the tariff rate is not revised, the Southeast Asian leather factories will not be able to resume operations and the leather industry in this city will continue to suffer losses. Both parties feel pain. At a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap and all industries are declining, how can the losses caused by red tanned cowhides be further increased? We hope that the esteemed commission will show compassion for the cold market situation and make every effort to maintain it. We again request the Ministry of Finance to approve the revision of the import tariff on red tanned cowhides in the shortest possible time so that the Southeast Asian leather factories and the leather industry in this city can gradually recover their original businesses. We now enclose samples of the goods in accordance with the Ministry's approval and request the customs to review them. We also write again to respectfully request your assistance in providing relief without any delay." Based on this, the red tanned cowhides are produced in Southeast Asia and used in this city. The import tariff rate has not been reduced and the industry is declining rapidly. The request for a prompt revision is a matter of urgency. In accordance with the Association's letter, we continue to request you to review and approve the Association's continued request for a prompt tariff reduction in order to maintain the leather industry. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully reports.</p>

<p>Miaogang and Wugang</p>
<p>All steamship companies in this port operating to Beisha yesterday received instructions from Chongming County stating that in order to comply with the matter, the county government convened a county-wide emergency meeting of various agencies and organizations on the second of this month, at which the district chiefs of the Guanghui Association proposed banning night sailings of steamships to prevent petty criminals from mingling and to maintain security. It was resolved and announced by the county government to prohibit steamship night sailings and to notify various steamship companies and district offices. It was further stated that in view of the current unstable situation and rampant banditry in neighboring areas, the county should strictly implement the resolution for strict prevention measures. In addition to issuing separate notices, the companies are hereby ordered to comply, and all steamships operating to the county, regardless of the port they pass through, are prohibited from entering the area at night. Violators will be investigated and detained by the relevant district office without any delay. This order is of utmost importance. After receiving the order, the companies convened a meeting at the Shanghai Shipping Association to discuss countermeasures. The outcome of the discussion was that Miaogang, Wugang, and other ports under Chongming, steamers leaving from Shanghai to those places will inevitably sail at night. If sailing at day time, it will cause loss both sides and be hard to change. It is a matter of the great responsibility for local security, therefore it has been decided that steamships will temporarily not stop at the two ports under Chongming County to comply with the order.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Old Case of a Greek Man Killing His Wife Was Retried in Court Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Cases Previously Handled by the Mixed Court</p>
<p>Often Had Two Judgments</p>
<p>The Chinese Official's Judgment Should Be Considered Valid</p>
<p>Legal Issues Will Be Submitted for Interpretation</p>
<p>George C. Poulos, a Greek national residing in Shanghai, murdered his wife, Snow Frieda, on October 13, 1921. He was sentenced to five years in prison by the former Mixed Court. Upon completion of his term, the case was reviewed in court. At that time, there was a consular assessor, who ordered a 14-year imprisonment. Nine years has passed now. Mr. George is now 52 years old. During the summer, it was reported he was severely ill in prison, and the Western prison warden requested the Special District Court to grant him parole. However, after a medical examination, it was deemed that his life was not in imminent danger, and the request was rejected. It is now learned that the Special Court, in order to carry out the review procedures for this case, ordered the police to bring the prisoner to the court yesterday afternoon. Judge Xu Youzhi opened the second courtroom for the trial, and Prosecutor Guo attended to perform his duties. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, requested that George be allowed to sit during the interrogation due to his extreme weakness. The judge granted the request and allowed him to sit after answering. The police lawyer then began his statement, saying that the case was a tragic and premeditated one. A review of the transcripts from the previous trial would make this clear. Two days before the incident, George purchased a sharp knife and lured his wife to a desolate area, where he attempted to stab her. However, the knife slipped from his hand and fell to the ground, foiling the murder attempt. He then changed his plan and strangled his wife to death. There were many witnesses at the time, but due to the passage of time, it is difficult to bring these witnesses to court. If the case had occurred today, the perpetrator would bear a heavier penalty, possibly the death penalty. The agreement on the recovery of the courts, stipulated by the Chinese and foreign commissioners, stated that all judgments made by the former Mixed Court and the Provisional Court should be considered valid. This case was judged by the former Mixed Court, and if the court wishes to deem it invalid and make a more appropriate judgment, the police express their sympathy. It is worth briefly recounting the history of the Mixed Court and the differences between Chinese and Western official judgments. During the winter of 1911, when the revolutionary army launched the uprising and overthrew the Qing Dynasty, the Chinese officials of the Mixed Court left their posts, and the court was left without a leader. The consular body then stepped in to take over, and consuls from various countries took turns hearing civil and criminal cases involving Chinese and foreigners in the concession. The consuls and the Chinese officials hired by the Municipal Council were paid by the Municipal Council, and the Chinese officials were not appointed by the Chinese government. Therefore, they were also subject to the direction and supervision of the Municipal Council. The power of judgment was entirely in the hands of the consuls, and the Chinese officials' position was equivalent to that of advisors. The Chinese officials' judgments in criminal cases were limited to five years. It is unknown why this limitation was put in place. The current Mixed Court in the French Concession still follows this practice. For example, if an offender needs to be sentenced to more than five years, they are sent to the Chinese authorities in the Chinese area for handling. However, since the consular body took over the court, it has not allowed the transfer of cases involving sentences of more than five years to the Chinese authorities, and the Chinese officials of the court have this verdict of "reviewing the case in court upon completion of the five-year term" to remedy the situation. Therefore, if the judge believes that the term of the sentence handed down by the Chinese officials of the former Mixed Court has expired, the offender can be released, and the police will not object. However, if the judge believes that the previous judgment was too lenient and that a retrial is necessary to increase the sentence, that would be even more appropriate. There are still about 200 prisoners in Western prisons who are in the same situation as in this case (i.e., the Chinese and Western judgments are different). Most of the crimes they committed were serious robbery and kidnapping. The sentences handed down by the consuls were all more than 10 years, while the Chinese officials still made the judgment of "revisiting in court after serving the five-year sentence." Therefore, if the defendant in this case is released today, all 200 or so people should also be released. Conversely, all of them must be retried. However, if all these 200 people are released, it will inevitably create security problems, and even a slight move will affect the whole situation. Therefore, it is important to be cautious from the beginning. Therefore, the lawyer requests that the judge submit this case to the Supreme Court for interpretation, and the police will comply with the instructions after receiving the Supreme Court's interpretation. Judge Xu then declared that the court's motion was based on Article 4 of the annex to the agreement. However, the "judgment of the former judicial organ" mentioned in the agreement refers to the judgment made by the judges who constituted the judicial organ. Even if the consul attending the court was involved in the trial of the case in fact, he cannot be regarded as a judge. Therefore, if the judicial organ has two judgments in the same case, naturally only the judgment of the judge, i.e., the Chinese official, is valid, because the consul does not have the authority to adjudicate. The motion for review is not to release all defendants who have been imprisoned for more than five years. Serious cases that are severely punished by the court should be handled according to the law and are not subject to any restrictions. The lawyer's request to request an interpretation of the legal issues will be forwarded to the court after a written opinion is submitted. Then, the defendant was questioned about the facts of the case. The defendant only answered a few words before his old illness recurred and his body trembled. The judge felt that he was seriously ill and ordered him to be returned to custody and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3 id="e143">The Kidnapping Case of Xu Anhou Was Pronounced Yesterday <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Nine Bandits Each Imprisoned for Five Years and Deported</p>
<p>And Sent to the Inland Court for Trial</p>
<p>Xu Anhou, an employee of the Shanghai Bank residing at No. 41 Brainee-Montauban Road in the French Concession, hired a car at 8 a.m. on the 2nd of last month, intending to go to work at the bank, but he was kidnapped by bandits and hidden in the Fanjiatai area on the border of Qingpu in western Shanghai. The perpetrators then demanded a ransom of 300,000 yuan from the victim's family, but the ransom was not paid. Paul, a Western detective of the special agency of the French police; Jin Jiulin, a detective inspector; Li Yaolong, a chief detective; Qian Yumin, Mao Jingen, Wang Rusong, Lu Zhulin, Bao Ziying, Zhou Bu-guang, and other plainclothes detectives learned of the situation and, along with other plainclothes detectives on duty, rushed to the bandit den in Fanjiatai, where they apprehended nine bandits, including Zhang Peiqing, Zhu Sannan, Chen Debao, Zhou Jinsheng, Luo Xiaohai, Xi Xiangsheng, Qin Pangen, Wang Shuji, Chu Yunlong, and others. They shot and killed one bandit, Zhang Amao, on the spot, seized three handguns, and rescued the hostage. The details have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, the police summoned the victim to bring the defendants to the French Court for investigation. The Chinese and Western officials presided over the criminal court and investigated the case. A person named Jia acted on behalf of the plaintiff and described the circumstances of the kidnapping. Then, Sacier, the Western chief detective, described the process of cracking the case and submitted the confession of the handgun. Judge Zhu Chengshen read the confessions of the various bandits submitted by the police one by one. When asked, the bandits all admitted to the crime without hesitation. The Chinese and Western officials then sentenced Zhang Peiqing, Zhu Sannan, Chen Debao, Zhou Jinsheng, Luo Xiaohai, Qin Pangen, Ding Shuji, and Chu Yunlong to five years in the Western prison and deportation, and the handguns were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Water and Land Police of Daan Port Outside Wusong Port Vigorously Suppressed Pirates <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Daan Port in Haimen County, located outside of Wusong Port, is located on the coast with many estuaries and harbors, making it easy for pirates to come and go. It was previously occupied by a large group of pirates who suddenly abandoned it, and then returned again. The Fourth District and Eighteenth Squad of the Wusong Water Police repelled the bandits, as repeatedly reported in this newspaper. However, the day before yesterday, more than 500 pirates suddenly arrived again on more than 30 pirate ships and landed on the port. The pirates were all equipped with rifles, as well as Mauser pistols and handheld machine guns, resembling a military force with great momentum. Wu Yaochun, the magistrate of Haimen County, immediately joined forces with Lin Cha, the captain of the Eighteenth Squad of the Water Police, and Zhong Jun, the leader of the First Platoon of the Eighteenth Squad of the Water Police, and Cheng Rusong, the captain of the County Police Brigade. At about 10:00 p.m. that night, they attacked the pirates head-on by land and water. The two sides engaged in a fierce battle for about three hours. The pirates stubbornly resisted with their numbers, acting in an extremely ferocious manner. Fortunately, Captain Lin and Platoon Leader Zhong bravely launched fierce attacks by land and water, continuously firing rapid-fire cannons. The pirates were unable to withstand the attacks and began to flee to the pirate ships and set sail south. The water and land police took advantage of the victory to pursue the pirates, and many pirates were shot and fell into the water. In this battle, more than a dozen firearms were seized, and five members of the water and land police were injured. They have been sent to the hospital for treatment. There are currently no traces of bandits in the area, and the residents are celebrating. Magistrate Wu of Haimen has submitted a request to the provincial authorities to commend Captain Lin, Platoon Leader Zhong, and Captain Chen of the County Police Brigade for their effective defense.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Changshu County Purchases Warship to Suppress Bandits <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Magistrate Tan of Changshu County has recently recognized the rampant pirates of the coastal ports such as Baimao and Hupu and it is difficult to suppress them. He plans to purchase a warship to station at Baimao, Hupu, and other locations to protect local security. Recently, Magistrate Tan, along with Xia Sumin of Hupu and others, ordered the Taiji steamship in Shanghai, agreeing on a ship price of 16,000 yuan. On the 25th of last month, Tan, Xia, Yang Zaitian, Li Negang, and others, agreed with the Zhonghua Shipyard to conduct a test run. At that time, the ship departed from Shanghai and sailed to Zhanghuabang in Songnan and returned. The test results showed that the ship's speed was quite good, but there were also many damaged parts of the machinery. It was agreed on the spot to sail into the factory for repairs and to convert the ship into a warship style. An additional 300 yuan was added for repair costs. That evening, a contract was signed in Shanghai, with an initial payment of 5,000 yuan for the ship price. The remaining payment was agreed to be paid in full if no adverse conditions were found during the three-month trial period. Once the warship is repaired, it will immediately carry out its bandit suppression work. The funds for the purchase of the warship have been agreed to be levied at 2% on the land tax. The area to be protected by the warship will extend from Baimao Port to Fushan, as well as the sea areas around Taicang and Liuhe.

<p>The case of World Book Company suing Kaiming Bookstore, which was judged by Judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Shanghai Special District Court, sentenced Du Haisheng, the manager of Kaiming, to a fine of 30 yuan for public insult. The details have been reported in the newspapers. Now, we have found the full text of the judgment and copied it below: (Main text) Du Haisheng is fined 30 yuan for the crime of publicly insulting others. Zhang Xichen is not guilty. (Facts) The self-plaintiff, Shen Zhifang's World Book Company, published a book this year which the defendant, Du Haisheng, manager of Kaiming Bookstore claimed was copied. The content of the Standard English Reader was quite similar to the English reader published by Kaiming Bookstore in the past. After the defendant entrusted a lawyer to negotiate, Lin Handa, the editor of World Book Company, came forward to discuss, but no agreement was reached. Then, Kaiming Bookstore published various terms such as the World Book Company's Standard English Reader being copied from Kaiming's English Reader in various newspapers in Shanghai from August 26 to 29, and printed small pamphlets and distributed them everywhere. The self-plaintiffs and others believed that the defendants had harmed their reputation and credit and violated Articles 325, Paragraph 2, 330, and 328 of the Criminal Law, and successively sued the court. (Reasons) The Standard English Reader published by World Book Company has two poems that are the same as the English Reader published by Kaiming Bookstore, and the source was not indicated. Therefore, Du Haisheng's dissemination of defamatory words against World Book Company is not comparable to fabricating facts. According to its circumstances, it is nothing more than self-defense of its rights, according to Article 326 and Article 327, item 1, of the Criminal Law, it is not punishable. Although the disseminated words are beyond the scope, there is still a basis and it is not comparable to rumors. It is also difficult to constitute the crime of harming credit under Article 330 of the Criminal Law. However, the Shenbao newspaper published on August 30 and the pamphlets distributed by the defendant contained "I hope that more knowledgeable people will be hired to edit books in the future and be careful in doing things." It also cited two sections of "World Strange Tales," Ai Zi stayed at an inn and lost his fox fur, which was obtained from a traveler's luggage. One section is compared to theft, and the other is no different from pointing out that the other party's editors are all ignorant. This kind of blatant and insulting words deliberately exceed the necessary scope of their statement and make people feel embarrassed. It should constitute the crime of insult under Article 324 of the Criminal Law. Except for the defendant Zhang Xichen, who is only an ordinary clerk and should be exempted from discussion, it should be judged separately according to Article 315 of the Criminal Procedure Law as in the main text. If you do not accept the decision, you may appeal to the collegial panel of this court within 10 days from the day after receiving the judgment.</p>

<h3 id="e151">The Case of a Monk Sodomizing a Disciple Opens <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The monk Miao Wang was accused of sodomizing Zheng Hehou, a pastry shop apprentice, at No. 70 Tangfang Lane on the 25th of last month in the lunar calendar, causing inflammation of the anus. Chen Ali, the shop owner, reported the incident to the police and had Miao Wang arrested and brought to the District Court. After examination and interrogation, the prosecutor filed a public prosecution citing the crime of disrupting public morals. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao Yongzhou opened the third courtroom for trial. The defendant, Miao Wang, claimed to be 24 years old, from Anhui Province, and currently registered at the Haichao Temple in Lujiabang as a monk. "I am innocent because they know that I came from Mount Putuo, and they intended to extort 20 yuan from me. At 2 p.m. on the 25th, Zheng Hehou came to me at the second floor of Lao Er's house at No. 70 Tangfang Lane to ask for money for steamed buns, but I didn't owe him any money, so I hit him and he cried. There was no one else in the room at that time. Later, Lao Er came home and the child had not yet left. He beat me because I was making trouble upstairs. I am a monk and don't do such things." Chen Ali claimed to be 31 years old, from Nengzhou, and ran a pastry shop at No. 56 Tangfang Lane. "Zheng Hehou is an apprentice, only 13 years old, and has only been here for more than a month. I don't know the monk Miao Wang. He was at Lao Er's house at No. 70. Lao Er's house specializes in renting out monk lodgings. The child went to deliver buns</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>To ask for money, later the child cried because I was not far away, I thought he was being beaten, so I went to argue, and Lao Er was beating Miao Wang severely, because the matter was explained, the child fought casually and instead advised him, unexpectedly the child shouted butt eye pain, I asked him why, he said he was sodomized by the monk, so I knew, so I wanted Lao Er to hand over the man, when he was sent here it had been examined and it was true, and the child's excretion has blood." Zheng Hehou claimed to be 13 years old, from Tongzhou. "I don't know the monk. I went to his house to ask for money, about 1,600 yuan. The monk was in the back building. There was no one else in the room at that time. He carried me to the bed and pressed me down on the bed. He pressed me behind me. He also pressed my mouth. It was very painful at the time, with blood, but it didn't last long. Then he pushed me to the ground." At this point, the official said to the defendant, "The matter is very clear. Tell the truth." The monk still quibbled. The official then declared the debate over and the sentencing will be next Monday. The defendant was sent back to custody.</p>

<p>At 9:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, two people from Ningbo, Dai Qin-gen and Jin Cai-yuan, went to Jinchangxiang Hardware Store near Broadway Road with a note from Moli-Pound Company to collect paint worth more than 200 yuan. Moli then sent a colleague with Dai to the warehouse to pick up the goods. Upon closer inspection, the Moli stamp on the note was different from the previous stamp. When asked about this, Moli realized that it was a forgery. Fortunately, the goods had not been picked up, so he reported it to the Hongkou police, who sent detectives to arrest Dai and Jin. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Feng interrogated them. According to plainclothes detective Shen Dehui, the defendant had not only once defrauded goods by using other people's names. He requested an extension to allow for further investigation. When questioned, Dai confessed that Jin had given him the note and told him to pick up the goods. Jin first escaped at the entrance of Jinchangxiang and was later arrested by him in the Chinese Park. He was in fact deceived by him, he said. Jin confessed that he had worked for Moli before, but had no way to make a living after he resigned. Therefore, he asked a fortune-teller to write this note and forge the stamp, and entrusted Dai to pick up the goods from the store. The court ordered the two defendants to be detained and rescheduled for questioning.</p>

<h3 id="e155">A Record of a Cruel Teacher Abusing His Apprentice <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Zhao Sangen's Life Is Over</p>
<p>Neighbors Express Great Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Mo Xianggan, a 27-year-old silversmith from Shaoxing, resides at No. 1, Alley 88, Yujia Lane, Xiaonanmen, Southern City. His wife is notoriously shrewish, and the neighbors are wary of her. However, Mo's character is even more cruel. In the spring of this year, someone introduced a fellow villager named Zhao to be his apprentice. The boy's name is Sangen, and he is 13 years old. Since arriving at Mo's house, Mo and his wife have treated him as a master and mistress and abused the apprentice in many ways. Every day, they force him to get up and work at dawn, and if he is not careful, he is scolded by the mistress. He is not allowed to rest from morning to night, and if he is lazy, he is dragged to the kitchen, stripped of his clothes by Mo, and severely beaten. Or they would use huge wooden sticks and iron tools to whip him, and he was forbidden to cry out. After the beating, he was told to put on his clothes and continue working as usual, without being given any food. Every time he was punished, he was denied food. For several months, the apprentice had been covered in wounds, with broken skin and blood flowing. However, he did not rest from his work, but only lamented and shed tears in secret. The neighbors in the area had long been accustomed to this. On the 21st of this month, the neighbors caught a glimpse of a thick hemp rope around the apprentice's neck. At first, they did not know its purpose, but later they learned that if the apprentice was slow in his work, Mo would pull the rope tightly from behind, making it difficult for him to breathe. At this point, the apprentice could not shout, but could only tremble his hands and feet. After a long time, he was allowed to loosen his private punishment, and then he adjusted his breathing and continued to work. When the neighbors realized this, they felt that his cruel actions were too inhumane and tried to persuade him, but they were scolded and dared to rely on his rudeness, saying, "My apprentice should be supervised. It's none of your business. If I beat him to death, I will of course be responsible for compensation. What's the big deal?" The neighbors were unwilling to do more. Unexpectedly, at about 9 a.m. yesterday, the apprentice suddenly died. Mo then quietly bought a coffin and prepared for the funeral. Who knew that the nearby neighbors Zhao Gensheng, Zhou Nanrong, Dong Rongxiang, Dong Rongsheng, Wu Fugao, Wu Shangkui, etc., had learned that the apprentice had died from injuries caused by the teacher's abuse. Therefore, they could not contain their public anger and jointly submitted a petition to the relevant first district and third precinct, requesting a thorough investigation. The precinct chief Jin, according to the previous reports, believed that his abuse of the apprentice was so cruel and rare that he should be severely punished. He immediately sent patrolman Zhao Shuyan to the location and found that the deceased Zhao Sengen's neck and feet were swollen and covered in scars. He arrested the murderer Mo Xianggan and brought him back to the precinct. Precinct Chief Jin ordered that the case be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for interrogation, and ordered Zhu Runqing, the head of the 19th shop, to report to the court for an autopsy.</p>

<h3 id="e160">Inability to Marry Leads to a Robbery <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Ruyizi Cries Out "Robber!"</p>
<p>Li Xianggui Detained by the Authorities</p>
<p>Li Xianggui, a 22-year-old man from Yangzhou, lives at No. 5 Yude Lane, Lannidu, Pudong, and works in a bathhouse tea room. On March 16th of the lunar calendar this year, he was betrothed to Ruyizi, the daughter of Xu Xia, a woman from Gaoyou who lives in a shack behind the Huatong Stack, with Wang Shaofu, a foreman from the Taikoo Dock, and Ding Shen, an old woman from Yangzhou, as matchmakers. Ruyizi is 18 years old and works in the Rihua Cotton Mill in Lujiazui. At that time, it was agreed that the gift-giving ceremony would be held on the sixth day of this month. However, Xia's mother is stubborn and clinging to old customs, demanding a large sum of money and all kinds of gifts, claiming that if they are not provided, it will be difficult to agree to the marriage. Xianggui's monthly income is limited, and upon hearing this news, he was inevitably panicked. He repeatedly asked the matchmakers to intercede with the woman's family, requesting a reasonable reduction. Although he was tired of talking, Xia's mother remained unmoved. Seeing that the date for the gift-giving ceremony was imminent, and he would be unable to cope, it was bound to become a laughingstock. Out of desperation, he discussed with his brother Xianglin and decided to abduct the bride. First, they would abduct Ruyizi and take her home, then they would negotiate with her family. If the other party still insisted on the original agreement, then what's done is done, and the other party would probably have no way to object. Once the plan was decided, on the evening of the day before yesterday, at five o'clock, he gathered many relatives and friends and waited near the factory next to the British-American Tobacco Company. Before long, Ruyizi arrived gracefully. Xianggui was afraid of grabbing the wrong person and causing a scandal, so he carefully examined her to make sure it was her. Then he personally stepped forward, hugged Ruyizi around the waist, and ran quickly towards the Pudong Bund, hoping to take her to the home of a relative or friend in Puxi for temporary shelter. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned. Ruyizi did not recognize the person hugging her as her fiancé, so she shouted "Robber!" A nearby patrol officer heard the noise, chased after them, stopped Xianggui, and arrested Xianggui's brother Xianglin, who was helping him, as well as Zhang Asi from Yangzhou and Li Gan, a woman from Yangzhou. They took Ruyizi along with them to the fourth team of the police station and transferred them to the third district. District Chief Zhang took the group into custody for preliminary interrogation and summoned Ruyizi's mother, Xu Xia, and the original matchmakers, Wang Shaofu and Ding Shen, to the case for questioning. According to the defendant Xianggui's statement, the woman's family demanded excessive gifts, which he was unable to provide, so he had no choice but to resort to this measure. Moreover, Ruyizi had gone through proper betrothal procedures and would be his wife sooner or later, so he asked for forgiveness. According to Ruyizi's statement, the matter was entirely decided by her mother, and she had never been involved. According to the statements of the three people who helped with the abduction, they admitted to helping Xianggui abduct the bride. According to Xu Xia's statement, the defendant forced her into this freely, and she requested that he be investigated according to the law. According to the two matchmakers, the woman's family demanded a large sum of money, which was true, but they had promised to find a way to raise 50 yuan to lend to the defendant. They were completely unaware of this sudden abduction. The district chief verified the statements and considered that bride abduction was an evil custom inherited from the Qing Dynasty. In this era of innovation, such a forced custom should no longer exist. He immediately ordered that Xianggui and the other three be charged with obstructing local customs and reported to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. The original matchmakers were released on bail, and the plaintiff was advised that if they wished to prosecute the defendant, they could file a lawsuit in the local court in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>At 7:30 last night, four robbers broke into No. 33 Xicheng Lane, Maran Road, in the French Concession. They showed handguns to intimidate the residents into silence and ransacked the premises for a long time.

<p>Chief Qu of the First Precinct of the Fifth District of Zhabei has returned to his post for more than a month. Yesterday, the citizens of the district specially cast a silver cauldron and publicly appointed Fan Peng and others as representatives to present it, with the inscription "Returning Our Magistrate." The silver cauldron is very magnificent, with an elephant on top, and a pot of evergreen on the elephant's back, with profound meaning. It is not easy to manage the area surrounding the concession in the Fifth District and First Precinct, and the citizens have expressed their love and respect. Former Chief You Bolu was able to fearlessly argue with the Public Works Department based on reason in the dispute over the encroachment of Wusong Road. Chief Qu later fought for the water and electricity rights of Yuqingfang and the recovery of Arui Road. Both chiefs have been able to fight for national interests and benefit the local area. Therefore, they have both received the respect of the citizens of the district, who have cast silver cauldrons to commemorate the love and support of the citizens.

He had been suffering from edema all over his body due to red pill poisoning for the past few months. The night before yesterday, he died of exhaustion. Because no one cared for him, his body was exposed day and night until yesterday, when a kind resident of the neighborhood obtained a coffin from the Aid Society and buried him in the public cemetery.</p>

<p>Recently, many cases of hidden heatstroke have been discovered in this city. This is because in the summer, people are exposed to heatstroke, and in the early autumn, they are attacked by sudden cold, so both latent evil and external cold occur at the same time. Initially, there are symptoms of fever, chills, headache, and aching joints. If not treated properly, the fever will increase, the tongue will become dry, and the lips will be parched, or dangerous signs such as white spots will appear, which is commonly known as typhoid fever. Tao Gengyu, a physician at the Dunren Public Institute in Sunjia Lane, Zhonghua Road, outside the Great East Gate in this city, has been practicing medicine for many years and has rich experience. He is also confident in treating this disease, so patients who go to him for treatment are always cured.</p>

<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau reported yesterday that Qin Huiren, a lost boy, also known as Tiansheng, was sent by the First Precinct of the Second District. He is said to be 14 years old and from Wuxian. His real name is Qin Tiansheng, also known as Jiang Yulin. His father's name is Huiren, and he is a doctor in Shanghai with no fixed address. After his mother died, his father entrusted him to Jiang Zhixiang, a coppersmith living at No. 15 Niujiaobang, Suzhou. Therefore, he changed his name to Jiang Yulin and studied in the fourth grade of Wuchu School. However, his father had not sent living expenses to Jiang Zhixiang for the past few months, and Jiang was about to move due to poor business. He told me to take a train to Shanghai to find my father, but I did not know the address and got lost. The child has a square face, yellowish skin, a disabled left eye, and is wearing a white official gauze shirt, a sweat vest, hemp gauze blue trousers, white foreign socks, and blue cloth shoes. He has now been sent to Xin Puyu Hall to study and is waiting to be claimed.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Tianchan Stage to Cease Performances at the End of the Month <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Resolution of the Public Works Department Board Meeting</p>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that the issue of the operating period of the Tianchan Stage has been under negotiation for a long time. According to the Public Works Department's plan, the building is considered to be extremely dangerous in case of fire and must cease performances or be relocated by the end of this month. The manager of the stage previously stated that the artists all had contracts and that the losses would be immeasurable if performances were stopped. He repeatedly appealed to be allowed to continue performances until the end of the year, arguing that the building would not be dangerous within this year. The Chinese directors also interceded on his behalf. Recently, at a meeting of the Public Works Department Board, based on the opinion of the department's legal counsel, it was considered that the situation would be very serious in the event of a fire at the stage, and the head of the Engineering Department also believed that, from a safety standpoint, it could not be considered a first-class building in the event of a fire. Therefore, a director suggested that the manager be ordered to stop performances before the end of this month. After a brief discussion, it was decided to order the head of the Engineering Department to negotiate with the manager of the stage to stop performances before the end of this month, and the Fire Department staff was charged with taking special fire prevention measures. The chairman of the department, Fei Xindun, also believed that if safety was the main concern, then other details were not important and not worth considering.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Citywide Labor Union Petitions for Permanent Existence <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>States Old Customs of Improper Dismissal Still in Use</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that the city's labor unions, due to the central government's temporary suspension of the abolition of labor unions and the government's approval of the continued use of old customs for dismissing workers, have successively received instructions from the municipal and central authorities for approval and have considered them to be insightful and have indicated their adoption. However, the citywide labor unions still listed the reasons why labor unions should exist permanently, demanding that the central government determine the organization and promulgate an explicit text, stating that the old customs of improper dismissal should be abolished quickly, and dispatched five group representatives and seven representatives to Beijing the day before yesterday with official documents to petition the Central Executive Committee, the Central Training Department, the National Government Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the International Labor Bureau, and the Labor Director of the eight organizations. The following are excerpts from the two petitions: (1) Petition for approval to determine the permanent organization of labor unions and to separately formulate single regulations for the organization of shop employees to ensure protection and national transportation matters. Upon investigation, the recently promulgated Law of Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations by the Central Government is based on the reason that to develop commerce, labor-capital cooperation must be realized first, and to realize labor-capital cooperation, workers must join the trade association before they can melt into one furnace and jointly seek the development of business. The central government has made painstaking efforts to maintain national commerce and eliminate the prejudices of labor and capital. For the sake of their own interests and for the future of commercial and labor transportation, they have no choice but to express their concerns. I dare to express the advantages and disadvantages to the superiors. According to the absolute freedom of the people to assemble and form associations, all those who earn a price with physical or mental strength to maintain their lives are workers, and the teachings of the Prime Minister should be regarded as the criterion. The organization of labor unions is in line with the doctrine and is relevant to the needs of the times and the environment. Moreover, labor unions have never been behind others in the history of the revolution. Workers and merchants belong to the same people and the same banner, and both workers and merchants can organize groups. Why is the labor union alone not allowed? Even if shop employees over the age of fifteen can send representatives to participate in the trade association, what will happen to shop employees under the age of fifteen? Moreover, it is still a question whether the representatives they send can implement their proposals in the trade association. Judging from the daily relationship between labor and capital, it is undoubtedly that the workers' representatives will be suppressed by the capitalists' representatives. In this way, the workers' representatives will have only a nominal title and no actual power. It is unnecessary to say that unfortunately, workers feel that their position is not guaranteed, are confused by the heresies of reaction, and take risks that endanger Anning. Is it not even more serious that the affiliated associations want the implementation of laws and regulations to be in line with the doctrine and in line with the needs of the times? As the main body, the affiliated associations aim to realize labor-capital cooperation and develop commerce as the premise, only because capitalists have too deep feudal concepts, so they use revolutionary means to promote their reflection. Chu Zhu has never had a single doubt. Although the paths are different, the destination is the same. If the organization of labor unions is abolished, tens of thousands of workers will be at a loss and not know where to go. The advantages and disadvantages are clear to the affiliated associations. Regarding this case, although we have submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Training Association to forward it to your department, we have been approved to temporarily suspend the cancellation in accordance with the previous instructions. However, the two words "temporary suspension" make the affiliated associations feel anxious. If we can't avoid it, we can only send Wang Yongchang, Chen Shuzhi, Huang Shaoxu, Hu Shouqi, Zhu Xiaoyun, Sang Yutang, and Zhao Zhenhui, editors of the Shanghai Business Press Distribution Labor Union, the General Affairs Section Labor Union, the Calligraphy and Stationery Fan Labor Union, the Silk and Cloth Dyeing Labor Union, and the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union, as seven representatives from five groups to visit the superiors and plead for your consideration of the people's sentiments and approval of the labor union organization, and to separately formulate single regulations regarding the organization of shop employees to comply with, so that shop employees can have appropriate guarantees. From now on, labor and capital will each have a basis, and the party will guide and the government will supervise, so there will be no actions outside the orbit that will endanger commercial development and social peace. I hereby present it. The way to hire and dismiss shop employees according to old habits does not conform to laws and regulations and does not conform to public opinion. Please order its revocation. Hu City Social Bureau Announcement No. 106 stipulates that the hiring and dismissal of shop employees shall be temporarily handled in accordance with the old habits of each industry, and on August 26, the local newspapers published news about the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's investigation of the dismissal habits of various industries. The affiliated associations are terrified and cannot express their feelings. We believe that the government has long had clear provisions to abolish old habits. In the past, the Party and government jointly announced during each lunar calendar festival to prohibit the use of old habits and not to dismiss employees without reason. An Ji then created a self-contradictory policy, and it is even more unreasonable to use old habits when promoting the national calendar. Moreover, the labor unions of Shanghai City have been legally organized and have signed labor-capital contracts with capitalists. The dismissal methods are detailed in the articles, and both parties should absolutely abide by them. If a piece of paper from the Social Bureau causes the contracts of mutual trust and adherence between labor and capital in each industry to be completely destroyed, it will not only fail to eliminate the disputes between labor and capital, but will also increase the disputes. Moreover, a thorough investigation of the causes of labor-capital disputes in the past is nothing more than inequality in treatment and unjustified dismissal. The reason why capitalists have not dared to openly abuse coercion recently is because there are labor-capital contracts. Once the old habits are restored and shop employees are freely hired and dismissed, the affiliated associations dare to predict that not only will enthusiastic revolutionary movement and hard-working labor movement shop employees be discarded, and the statistics of social unemployment will inevitably increase, but labor unrest will also be inevitable. The impact on social peace is not small. Combining the above points, it is undeniable that Announcement No. 146 of the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau does not conform to laws and regulations and does not conform to public opinion. For the sake of social peace and to protect the on-the-job employees from unemployment, the affiliated associations are responsible and cannot bear to guarantee the wives of the shop employees, and even more cannot bear the government's laws and regulations to be like children's play. Therefore, we dare to send Wang Yongliang, Chen Shuzhi, and Huang Shaoxu, the head of the Shanghai Business Press's Distribution and Editing General Affairs Labor Union, Hu Shouqi of the Calligraphy and Stationery Industry Labor Union, Zhu Xiaoyun of the Silk and Cloth Dyeing Labor Union, Sang Yutang of the Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union, and Zhao Zhenhui, etc., as seven representatives to rush forward and petition, hoping that they will consider the hidden worries, comply with public opinion, and approve the order to revoke. I am extremely eager to wait for orders. Shanghai Business Press's Distribution Office Labor Union, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Calligraphy and Stationery Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Silk and Cloth Dyeing Labor Union, Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Sauce Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Pawn Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Pudong Electrical Labor Union, Shanghai Longan Grocery Labor Union, Shanghai China Merchants Bureau's Five Wharves Labor Union, Shanghai Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cake Exchange Labor Union, Shanghai Wine Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Su Ning Tea and Food Labor Union, Shanghai Cigarette Exchange Labor Union, Shanghai China Food Company Labor Union, Shanghai Porcelain Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Tea Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Business Press's Editorial Office Labor Union, Shanghai No. 1 Chinese Public Bus Labor Union, Shanghai Huiguan Labor Union, Shanghai South Goods Labor Union, Shanghai Parasol Labor Union, Shanghai Pollen Labor Union, Shanghai China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Labor Union, Shanghai Business Press's General Affairs Office Labor Union, Shanghai Water and Electricity Industry Labor Union, Shanghai Incense Industry Labor Union.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Dispute at the French Water and Electricity Labor Union Interrogated Yesterday <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Another Dispute Occurred Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that since the French Water and Electricity Labor Union was destroyed by reactionary workers the day before yesterday, it has been afraid that such a thing will happen again, so it plans to send a letter to the Public Security Bureau to hire a police officer to provide protection, while the internal work is also proceeding without any slackening. The situation yesterday is published as follows:</p>
<p>Another dispute occurred yesterday morning. At about 8:00 yesterday morning, a large number of workers, about 200, gathered in the area of the French Water and Electricity Plant in Lujiazui, demanding work. These people were all new workers from the previous strike period. The situation was very serious for a while, and the company authorities did not respond. These people said that since there was no work, it would be better to use force as a backing, claiming that they wanted to beat up the old workers so that they could find food. They waited from 8:00 to 12:00 for four hours. The old workers in the factory were afraid to go out when they heard the news. Then they reported to the French Concession Police Station, which sent a large number of patrolmen to drive these people away and restore the original situation.</p>
<p>An Open Letter to All Sectors of Society The labor union yesterday issued an open letter to the labor community of the city, saying, "Fellow workers of the city, before the previous labor movement, the capitalist of French imperialism used destructive and destructive means to break our group organization. They used several unscrupulous people in our labor union to instigate all our fellow workers. On the one hand, when our labor union was reorganized, these labor thieves wanted to take the opportunity to reorganize our labor union. Fortunately, their conspiracy was heard by a loyal comrade who still had a conscience, so they reported to the public, and their tricks were finally exposed and did not become a reality. However, the capitalists of French imperialism could not implement their planned plan because these labor thieves could not implement their planned plan. Money and spirit inevitably suffered a major blow. However, their destructive work was also unyielding. Later, when we wanted the capitalists to improve their treatment due to environmental pressures and life pressures, the capitalists took advantage of this opportunity and wanted to fundamentally eradicate our labor union, so they resolutely rejected our legitimate demands. Although we wanted to use the expression of a slowdown to make them realize, they had already honestly and rudely used the deportation policy to close the iron gate and not allow us to work. This method was obviously to cut off our lives. On the one hand, they also used the club labor thieves of the Transportation Department to destroy our tightly knit labor movement. Fortunately, we were tightly knit and were not moved by it. At the same time, we also received the assistance of our fellow workers in the city, and finally won the labor unrest on the surface. However, after investigating the actual situation, the capitalists have not fully fulfilled the conditions signed, and the oppression and abuse have become more and more intensified. However, our fellow workers are still enduring it, and sometimes they only negotiate with those responsible for mediation. How did they know that the French imperialists had bought off the thugs in the club this time and wanted to assassinate us, and they also destroyed our legitimate and legal worker group's association, and even insulted the Prime Minister's portrait. How can this be tolerated? In total, the French imperialists have repeatedly tried to destroy us in the past, which was still relatively secret. Now, it has become more and more obvious. All the fellow workers of this association, in addition to reporting the details to the higher-level authorities for investigation, have to report the beginning and end of this incident to my city's fellow workers. At the same time, I hope that my city's fellow workers will provide as much assistance as possible to save us from the fire and water."</p>
<p>The Team Leader Meeting Was Held Again Yesterday. Yu Haiquan Was Publicly Elected as Chairman. He Reported on the Purpose of the Meeting, Briefly Stating that Foreigners Had Instructed New Workers to Conflict with Workers in the Factory Today. Fortunately, the Police Arrived After Hearing the News and Drove the Others Away. Then It Was Resolved that the Capitalists Would Add Ten New Workers. Only After the Capitalists Fulfilled the Various Conditions Proposed by the Labor Union Within the Limited Time Could They Agree. Otherwise, the Labor Union Would Notify the New Workers to Leave the Factory When Necessary.</p>

<p>The Municipal Training Committee Rejects Approval</p>
<p>According to the National News Agency, workers at the Hengfeng Yarn Factory, due to the factory's long-standing harsh treatment, low wages, and excessive fines, launched a sudden strike on the 24th of this month when wages were distributed and significant deductions were made for fines. They formed a strike committee and presented eleven demands. Simultaneously, they reported the strike's progress and demands to the Municipal Training Committee, seeking assistance. Upon receiving the report, the Municipal Training Committee, noting that the factory had no labor union, that the demands had not been reviewed and approved by the Party, and that the strike had been initiated without following legal procedures, deemed it illegal and potentially disruptive. Besides thorough investigation, yesterday, the Committee issued a formal reply to all workers of the factory: “Your report states that the employer refused your demands, leading to a factory-wide strike, and requests swift assistance. Upon investigation, the factory lacks a labor union, and the proposed labor-management terms were neither submitted to this Committee for prior approval nor to the Social Bureau for mediation following the event, before the unauthorized strike, which is highly inappropriate. You are ordered to immediately resume work; your request is denied. This is the order.”</p>

<p>Mr. Wu Linshu, since falling ill last month, has been ill for a month. Despite being treated by renowned doctors, he did not recover and passed away at 2:00 PM yesterday at the age of 52. Mr. Wu was from Wu County, Jiangsu Province, and had resided in Shanghai for a long time. He engaged in numerous business ventures, possessed profound knowledge, and demonstrated a magnanimous demeanor, tirelessly supporting and promoting younger generations. When officials sought to entrust him with important positions, he politely declined, as his ambition lay in developing industries to benefit the people's livelihood. He was particularly attentive to the textile industry, and the Tongyi Yarn Factory and Yida Yarn Company that he managed achieved remarkable results. He served as a director of the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China, the Commercial Press, Ewo Yarns, Shanghai Yarn Factory, Chongxin Yarn Factory, Minsheng Yarn Factory, and Ningbo Hefeng Yarn Factory. He was also the chairman of the Shanghai Tongyi Yarn Factory, the China Cement Company, and the China Industrial Promotion Bank. Additionally, he served as the vice chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange. He resigned from his position only a year ago due to heavy workload. After the establishment of the National Government, government authorities issued two-fifths of customs duty treasury bills and specifically ordered Image of the Late Wu Linshu</p>
<p>the formation of the Two-Fifths National Treasury Bill Custody Committee. Mr. Wu was appointed by the authorities as a standing committee member. Mr. Wu often believed that the decline of China’s textile industry was due half to capital shortage and half to a lack of scientific management within textile factories. Therefore, in 1928, he traveled to Europe and the United States with his close friend Hu Jun’an and his son Ruiyuan to investigate textile management and cotton seed improvement. They spent a year in the cotton-producing regions of India, England, France, Italy, Germany, and the United States, conducting research. Upon his return, he contributed his findings to China's textile industry. Consequently, many in the textile industry directly or indirectly benefited from his guidance and achieved effective management. Mr. Wu was also extremely benevolent and over the years, he donated a considerable amount of his earnings to domestic and international charitable causes, as well as funding for schools and hospitals. It is reported that the funeral will be held on the 29th, and a memorial service will be held at a later date. Upon hearing of his passing, people from all walks of life expressed profound grief.</p>

<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>Butcher: Madam, why haven't you come to buy our meat for so long?</p>
<p>Female customer: Last time I bought a piece of your beef, it was so tough it could have been used for the sole of a shoe.</p>
<p>Butcher: Then why didn’t you just make a shoe sole out of it?</p>
<p>Female customer: It was so tough, even nails couldn’t go through it.</p>
<p>Affable lady (speaking to her friend's young daughter at a dinner party): Good child, you are only seven years old, and you can already help your mother?</p>
<p>Young daughter: Yes, every time we have guests, after they leave, my mother always asks me to help her check if any silver spoons and ivory chopsticks have been stolen by you.</p>
<p>A: Your son always takes a car to the office every day. Why do you always take a rickshaw yourself?</p>
<p>B: Because he has a rich father, but I, unfortunately, do not.</p>
<p>Diner: Waiter, why is your pork chop so tough?</p>
<p>Waiter: Sir, why don't you use a knife to cut it off?</p>
<p>Diner: I have already cut off a small piece, but it is still impossible to chew in my mouth.</p>
<p>Waiter: Since the knife can cut it off, it is certainly not tough. You should blame your own teeth, not us.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Anecdotes of Tan Yankai <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Tan Yankai, Premier of the Executive Yuan and Acting Chairman of the National Government, passed away at 9:55 AM on the 22nd of this month due to cerebral hemorrhage at his private residence in the capital. The National Government ordered all institutions in and out of Beijing to fly flags at half-mast for three days from the date of receiving the telegram, and to suspend all entertainment and banquets to express mourning. The facts have been noted in this newspaper, and now I will write about some trivial matters of his life as a memorial.</p>
<p>Tan's Beijing residence is located on Chengxian Street, not far from the National Government. It is a Western-style building facing the road and is not very magnificent. It is said to be rented from someone else. There is a guard at the door to provide security. The gatehouse is unusually small, with only one gatekeeper. Sometimes, he is busy receiving and sending letters and telegrams, and if one wants to convey information, he is flustered and unable to cope, unable to take care of everything. The reception room is downstairs, and the facilities are very simple, with only a large dining table and a dozen chairs. The four walls have neither ornate mirror frames nor paintings and calligraphy by famous people. Ordinary guests are led into this hall by the gatekeeper. Outside the hall, there is a staircase leading to Tan's study. Ordinary guests are not allowed to enter the courtyard at will. There is a little space decorated with flowers and evergreens. Tan has a large appetite and also likes to drink, comparable to Li Bai and crabs. He is kind-hearted, and he always helps his impoverished fellow villagers who come to him for loans. He treats people with kindness and never speaks harshly. Recalling last spring in Beijing, I and Ma Xiaojun, the chief of the General Staff, and Su Minsheng, the chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce, visited him at the same time on official business. Because there were so many documents and guests at the National Government, we could not talk in detail. He made an appointment to meet us at his private residence the next day. At 9:00 AM, we took a car to the reception room. It was already full of distinguished guests. After handing in our name cards and sitting for a while, the servant led us to the study upstairs for a tea talk. The study was small, with only a desk, a coffee table, two armchairs, and a bookshelf. Famous paintings and calligraphy and ancient musical instruments were hung on the wall. The bright windows and clean tables made it feel very refined. On the desk was a copy of the History of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, which was a manuscript with very elaborate characters. It is said that there were many historical materials about the Hong Yang Rebellion. At that time, due to the strict prohibition of the Qing Dynasty, the descendants of private authors feared the disaster of words and privately destroyed them. Now, he planned to collect them from various sources for reference and editing. When we were leaving, he accompanied us to the downstairs very warmly. A month later, I was drinking with a friend in the Fanghu wine shop in Shanghai's Xiangfen Lane. Tan also came upstairs with a friend for a drink, wearing a cloth robe and not bringing any followers. Those who did not know him would not know that he was an important figure in the National Government. During the chat, he inquired in detail about the rise and fall of Shanghai's business, which showed that he cared about people's livelihood. Unexpectedly, this farewell was the last time we would meet. Seeing his posthumous image in the newspaper yesterday, I couldn't help but feel emotional. I have supplemented the above record to express my admiration and to show that I will never forget him.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Rice Joke <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>A friend said that a certain county in Jiangbei has always suffered from rice shortages. One day, a new county magistrate, whose surname was Mi (rice), took office. The people saw that he was well-educated and had the qualities of a scholar, so they thought of making things difficult for him. They gathered at the county office to describe the rice shortage and asked the new county magistrate to find a way to solve it. The county magistrate was afraid that the crowd would cause trouble, so he stood up in public and said hastily, "Although my surname is Mi, I did not bring any rice. If you need rice, please ask the rice shops, do not ask me." His words were originally humorous, but he had no intention of causing trouble. Unexpectedly, the clever people led a team to rob the rice shops in the city. When the police tried to stop them, they said, "We are here on the order of the county magistrate." Thus, trouble arose. When the matter was reported to the superior, the superior knew that the words came from the county magistrate and that there was no excuse for his crime, so he issued an order to investigate him. The county magistrate Mi lost his official position because of his surname Mi. The matter is also interesting. I have written it down to show that the ancients' warning about being careful with words has its origins.</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Swallow Tower in the Swallow's Nest <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Meiqu</p>
<p>I have been sick for a dozen days since the beginning of autumn and have not been able to leave the West Building of Meiyuan. Last Wednesday, the Green-Clad Lady (i.e., my close friend Wu Liuyi) came to say goodbye before going to the capital. I told her about the boredom of living in the building. The Green-Clad Lady said, "Pan Pan did not leave the Swallow Tower for ten years, how can you not bear it for a dozen days?" We smiled at each other and ended the conversation. On September 21, I went to the residence of my friend Tong Runan to relieve my boredom. Runan is hospitable and all the guests were famous scholars. We were sipping tea, chatting, and commenting on calligraphy, painting, bronzes, and inscriptions. Suddenly, a young girl with pigtails jumped in and shouted, "Fourth Aunt is here!" Then I saw an aging woman without makeup but still charming, slowly entering the door, nodding and smiling to the guests, looking familiar. Runan's wife told Meiqu, "This is an old friend of Runan, and now she nests in the Swallow's Nest." Meiqu has seen so many women who have fallen from grace in Shanghai that he is not surprised. He is only surprised that Runan, a famous scholar, appreciates someone outside the realm of female beauty. A guest named Woyouzi understood my meaning and smiled at me, saying, "Where is there no talent? What a narrow view!" Then, while the woman was chatting with Runan, he told me about the woman's background. Meiqu said, "Strange, the Swallow's Nest has such a person, surpassing the Swallow Tower." The woman was one of Shanghai's famous beauties in her youth, and Runan was also among her admirers, but he had no intention of marrying her. When spring deepened, she chose to marry someone. The man had a little talent and a sharp pen and could help people settle lawsuits. He was a lawyer before the time of modern lawyers. The woman and the man were very happy together. After only a few years, the man went blind and could no longer wield his pen. The family became increasingly poor. The woman did not change her mind because he was blind and continued to support her mother-in-law and manage the household. The blind man had been relying on others to eat in bed for fifteen or sixteen years. Some old friends hinted to the woman, saying, "I love him to the end. Although his eyes are blind, his heart is not. He loves me as before. If I abandon him, his mother and son will both end up in the gutter." So she ran the Swallow's Nest and used all her earnings to support her mother-in-law and son. Runan valued her character and also helped her as much as he could. Guan Panpan was able to maintain her chastity because Zhang Jianfeng was willing to let her, and now she is immortal. But the woman entrusted to her is very humble, and there is no Jianfeng's illustrious reputation that can be used to achieve fame. She has sworn to remain chaste. If she had ordinary skills, she would not seek to live in the Swallow's Nest. It can be said that she is worthy of comparison with the Swallow Tower. The fact that Runan's adopted daughter calls her Fourth Aunt is because she has always been known as the fourth oldest. Her real name is unknown.</p>
<h3 id="e181">A Record of Daoist Zheng's 按導 Techniques <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Ma Yincai</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan, Daoist Zheng of Fang County, is famous for his skill in 按導 (pressing and guiding). Those who have been cured by him are too numerous to count. As far as I know, the niece of Mr. Zhou Junliangcai, the secretary of this city's municipal government, was eight years old when she contracted a severe swelling disease. Western and Chinese doctors all believed that the disease was in the kidney. Daoist Zheng alone believed that the disease was in the stomach and intestines. After treatment, yellow water leaked out of the pores of her legs, her urination was smooth, and she also passed a lot of black feces and white phlegm. Her illness was as if it had disappeared. Also, this summer, Mr. Cen Chunxuan of Guangxi suddenly became unable to move, with symptoms similar to stroke. He was introduced by his brother, Mr. Xilin (who had suffered from a serious illness and had been cured by Daoist Zheng), to seek Daoist Zheng's treatment. After one 按導 session, he could move. After three more 按導 sessions, he recovered. Also, Mr. Feng Mujun of Ningbo suffered from stomach problems for more than forty days in the summer and autumn. The pain became increasingly severe over time and he could not sit up. Daoist Zheng believed that the disease was caused by the depletion of heart qi, which led to damage to the spleen. If not treated quickly, it would become even more difficult. After six or seven 按導 sessions, he recovered. Mr. Feng told me that once 按撫 (pressing and stroking) was applied to his chest and stomach, he felt hot air rushing down to his dantian, steaming and bubbling, directly reaching his coccyx. When 按導 was applied to his bladder, the hot air traveled from his thighs to his knees, leisurely reaching his heels. This was the most amazing and refreshing sign. Daoist Zheng's 按導 method involves circulating the qi throughout the body and gathering it in the palm of the hand, directly transferring it to the patient's body. This is why it is so effective. Daoist Zheng can also take the pulse of the abdomen to predict life and death. He is especially good at treating critical and severe illnesses, such as bleeding, dysentery, abdominal pain, soreness in the hands and feet, severe liver, stomach, and heart qi pain, as well as typhoid fever, damp heat, and all kinds of difficult and complicated diseases. No matter how dangerous and critical, he can respond effectively. It is completely different from the current popular intangible massage and manipulation techniques. His disciples have compiled Daoist Zheng's Medical Efficacy Records, and Mr. Chen San'yuan, Mr. Wang Xicun, Mr. Cheng Zida, and Mr. Zhu Qiangcun all have inscriptions. These gentlemen have all benefited from his medical treatment. He is truly an outstanding physician.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Miscellaneous Records of the Great Calamity in Changsha (Part 1) <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Litian</p>
<p>The Shanghai newspapers have published many facts about the looting and arson caused by the Communist bandits' intrusion into Changsha. However, there are still many situations that not only people from other provinces do not know, but also the people who have experienced it may not necessarily know. Because they were in that kind of red terror and were busy fleeing for their lives, people did not have the leisure to ask about these endless, tragic things. Now that the unprecedented tragedy has passed, it is still worthwhile to write down a few of the things I saw and heard at the time to provide the people living in the concessions with something to talk about "after tea and dinner."</p>
<p>As soon as the Communist bandits entered the city, they set fire to it and posted slogans and notices, asking "the people of Changsha to work hard to participate in the riot." After this "deterrent," they demanded 700,000 yuan in cash from the Chamber of Commerce, and euphemistically called it "donations to support the revolution." Their notice stated, "The riots will seize Changsha to relieve the suffering of the proletariat and abolish all exorbitant taxes." But the Chamber of Commerce received this extortion order, which said that those who did not pay would be beheaded. They immediately convened a meeting of the defense corps. In addition to requiring the major merchants to raise a portion, all citizens, regardless of their poverty, were required to donate two months of rent. As a result, some of the people who could not afford to pay committed suicide, and some were sent to the "Red Army Headquarters," because those who did not pay were "counter-revolutionaries."</p>
<p>At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce used this condition of paying money to ask the Red Army Headquarters to find a way to "maintain order in the provincial capital," because the general riffraff and hooligans took the opportunity to rob, and with the addition of a decree rewarding those who reported on others, they were even more fierce. At that time, the commander-in-chief of the Red Army generously issued a notice stating, "Those who are hooligans and rob for no reason will be beheaded." Therefore, the way of looting shops was different. First, the Red Army or the spear team entered the shop to search and loot, and then sent armed or spear-wielding hooligans to guard the door. The Red bandits gathered outside the door. After the Red bandits looted the good goods, they shouted loudly when they left, "People, come and share the wealth!" Then these intangible Red bandits swarmed in and carried out a second search. Sometimes the Red bandits destroyed the shops and even tied up the bosses and their wives, torturing them to force them to hand over cash. Although most of the shopkeepers ran away, many were caught. At this time, the Red bandits were not "selective in their prey." As long as they opened a small shop, they were "奸商" (treacherous merchants). Their slogan was only "Farmers, Workers, Soldiers!" Merchants and intellectuals were among those who were overthrown.</p>
<h3 id="e183">A Record of Attending the North-South Chess Match <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Sent from Hong Kong</p>
<p>The long-planned North-South Chinese chess competition began on August 11th after the arrival in Hong Kong of Zhou Deyu and Lin Yixian, two masters from North China. This competition was organized by the South China Chinese Chess Research Association, which was founded last autumn by members of the Confucian Society. Chess masters from all walks of life responded enthusiastically. Since its establishment, the association has been brewing the idea of a North-South chess match. Last winter, a human chess competition was held at the South China Athletic Association's stadium. The initial plan was to have players from both North and South China participate, but the North China players were unable to come, so players from Guangzhou and Hong Kong filled the ranks. Only now has the North-South chess match become a reality.</p>
<p>The competition venue was the hall of the Chinese YMCA, with seating for over 500 people. Tickets were priced at 20 cents each, and a season pass for all nights was sold for one dollar. However, there were only about 300 spectators each night. This is because not many people are fond of this game, and it is difficult to make those who are not interested sit still for several hours. The competition was scheduled to start at 7:30 PM. I arrived on time on the first night and found that many spectators had already arrived. On the stage hung a chess board of about eight feet in length and width. The chess pieces were about four or five inches in diameter, making them quite clear to see from a distance. Next to the large chess board was a small table for the players to use their ordinary chess boards for the game. Each time a piece was moved, the referee loudly announced it, and two other people followed by moving the pieces on the large chess board for the audience to see. The order was quite good.</p>
<p>The South China players were Li Qingquan and Feng Jingru, both over 40 years old. Li's head was already half bald. Both had been immersed in Chinese chess for twenty or thirty years. They had reached the point of perfect mastery, as the saying goes. Li's style of play was steady and cautious, never taking risks. However, his defense was strong and he rarely made mistakes. Feng's original name was Zejiu, and he enjoyed the reputation of "Chess King." His style of play was erratic and unpredictable, sometimes taking risks to attack the enemy, with only a step separating him from being killed. Therefore, the audience often held their breath. However, Feng rarely failed in his risky attacks. The title of Chess King was truly not undeserved. In addition, there was Huang Songxuan, whose skill was also on par with Feng and Li, and they were known as the three wonders of the South China chess world.</p>
<p>In the first night's match, the top player from North China, Zhou Deyu, took the field. Zhou was a first-class player in the North China chess world, having traveled across several provinces without meeting an opponent. South China sent Li Qingquan to meet him. It was guessed that the intention was to use Li's steady style to maintain a draw, even if he could not win, in order to avoid losing the first match and ruining his reputation. Zhou had a handsome appearance and gentle demeanor, and was only in his thirties.</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM, a Mr. So-and-so, the announcer, announced the reasons for the meeting. When explaining the reasons for promoting Chinese chess, he quoted extensively from classical texts, proving himself worthy of being a member of the Confucian Society. His tone and attitude during the speech fully expressed the air of a scholar. The speech lasted about ten minutes, and the audience was quite impatient, eagerly awaiting the start of the great battle. When Li and Zhou were introduced to the audience, they applauded loudly.</p>
<p>In the first game, both sides moved very cautiously, with few surprising moves. At 9:15 PM, Li of South China drew with Zhou of North China, with a single chariot, cannon, pawn, and all elephants and advisors against Zhou's single chariot, horse, pawn, and all elephants and advisors. In the second game, the brilliant moves of both sides gradually emerged. Zhou was particularly lively. After thirty or so moves, Zhou had lost his horse and Li had lost his cannon. Zhou then sacrificed his chariot to try to kill the enemy. The audience initially looked surprised, but then understood the intention and applauded repeatedly. At this time, Li was in a precarious situation, but managed to save himself by defending well, sacrificing his chariot to remove Zhou's central cannon and reverse the dangerous situation. He then used the advantage of a full set of elephants and advisors, a cannon, two horses, and a pawn against Zhou's single chariot, pawn, and all elephants and advisors. At this time, Zhou's defensive skills were also greatly demonstrated, using his chariot to disperse the opponent's horses and cannons. Although Li sacrificed a pawn to remove Zhou's two advisors, his horse was ultimately trapped and unable to move. The whole game had to end in a draw. By this time it was already 11:30 PM. The scheduled three games to determine the winner were postponed to another day.</p>
<p>That night, in addition to ordinary spectators, almost all of the South China chess masters, such as Huang Songxuan, Deng Tieru, the champion of the Hong Kong Open Chinese Chess Competition, Zeng Zhanhong, Liu Shoupeng, Chen Depai, Duo Ruisheng, and Huang Zhangji, gathered. Huang Songxuan and Deng Tieru even placed chess pieces next to their seats and commented on the merits and demerits of Zhou and Li's moves. Zeng Zhanhong, the chairman of the North-South Chinese Chess Competition, carefully recorded Zhou and Li's moves with a pencil. Feng Jingru, who was not scheduled to compete that night, sat in the audience and commented on the moves of both sides in a low voice with his friends, gesticulating vividly. At the same time, Li Qingquan on the stage remained calm and focused on the chess board from beginning to end, without ever looking away. Zhou, on the other hand, was relaxed and often shifted his gaze to look at the audience after each move. From this, one could see the depth of his skill.</p>

<p>Highest price at 55 taels ... Up over 13 taels in recent days</p>
<p>The gold market advanced smoothly, with spot gold feeling very sharp and rising frequently. However, it weakened in the morning before rallying, rising over seven taels by midday. In the afternoon, it only rose and fell by about three taels, but the market advanced all the way, and the people's hearts were firm. Foreign exchange was also tense, and exchange rates narrowed by another half a grade. Trading among peers was still considered active, but suppliers were scarce, and most focused on buying. In the early market, companies such as Yuan Cheng, Yongtai, Kangrun, Yongfeng, Yuanxing, and Yong sold and then bought back. Yuanmao, Yongshunli, Wanxing, and small vendors sold some. Due to the inaction of silver bars in the morning, the price tended to soften. Later, various firms scrambled to buy. The foreign exchange became increasingly tight, and traders were eager to buy. The bank's intentions remained firm, so the gold market suddenly showed its brilliance and soared, exceeding the 50-tael mark. Near noon, it surged by six or seven taels. Later, Shifeng and Yongshunli both bought more, while Yuanda, Yuanmao, and Yong, among others, bought and then sold. Initially, the price was flat and soft, but after the exchange rate narrowed, it turned high. It once reached 55 taels. In the end, the selling momentum was strong and tended to weaken, reducing by two taels. However, due to the lack of silver bars, it may not fall for a while. More and more spot goods gradually appeared, so the price repeatedly fell. Approximately, it also increased by 21-22 taels according to the spot gold price. The price of gold increased about 21-22 taels according to the spot gold.</p>

Silver bars had not changed, the silver price was only down an eighth. There was no change in the European market. Then at 46 taels and three candareens, it regained its strenght with buyers aplenty with Yuanmao, Yong, Dadecheng, and others all advancing until the magistrate ordered no further posting for the time being at around 49 taels, then with slight ups and downs until 9:45 at 50 taels, 0.34 candareens. The internal magistrate first settled Holland's Zhengjin's doing the contract for this month at 7 pence, 75, then Sanlin and others offered December's gold at 1 tael, 2 mace, and 3 fen. Yuanmao and others sold slightly, so at 10 o'clock it fell to 48 taels, 7-8 candareens. After this, Taikangrun, Yuancheng, Yong and Yuanda, Zhifeng, Yong, Yuanxing, Yong and speculators and others bought competing with each other in droves. The sellers on the floor were very slack and the exchange rate also turned very nice breaking through the 50 tael mark. After that, Huabi offered December English gold at 7 pence, 8125, Sumitomo bought American gold at 40 yuan, 0.25. Then, Megary sucked in 1875 and made a monthly gold contract at 1 tael, 2 mace, and 4 fen until at 11:45 it was selling wildly at 53 taels, 5-6 candareens. At this time, Mitsui sucked in Dalian for the next month at 1 tael, 2 mace, and 4 fen. By noon, the market closed at 3 taels and 4 candareens, but still suppressed to 2 taels and a half due to small vendors selling. The published price was still at 600 taels, 0.06 candareens, calculated suppressing a small 51 taels to 47 taels.</p>
<p>In the end, up four taels nine, the after market opened at 53 taels and one candareen, then because slightly more sellers dropped to two taels or so, because HSBC's postings contracted, it rose to 50 odd taels, four candareens, before dropping a small one tael, two or three candareens. After that, Zhifeng Yong entered the market seeking to buy raising suddenly two taels until at 3:15 at 55 taels, Zhengjin swallowed January English gold at 7 pence, 8125, Mak reached December at 75 until then Yuanmao Yong and hedgers suddenly sold off sending hearts tumbling dropping suddenly one tael or so. Afterwards, Yuanda and others also offered at 4:20 at just 52 taels, 7-8 candareens. There was one tael lurking between until the market closed at 4:30 calculated at 53 taels, compared to the previous day up four taels, nine candareens, had been rising for days a total of over thirteen taels. In one day the maximum price 55 taels, minimum price 46 taels, three candareens, a difference of eight taels, seven candareens.

<p>Market Overview: Recently, the money industry has consistently insisted on two prices for clearing and lending, so there has been no special change. Therefore, the external situation is very calm, and there is no major change in price. However, there are unspeakable inner secrets. Because the silver root is secretly tight, the trading of loan tickets is often strictly selected and inspected. Even if there is only one transaction, they are willing to be slightly sloppy, so that the general family lacking silver feels greatly exhausted.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Reason for the Apparent Looseness and Secret Tightness of Silver Funds <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Credit funds released cannot be returned as scheduled</p>
<p>Several businesses went bankrupt due to lack of cash flow</p>
<p>Recently, the appearance of silver funds has been quite calm, but the actual content is extremely tense. The general phenomenon of silver shortage has made it very difficult to draw in and purchase bills. According to people in the industry, the reason for the apparent looseness and secret tightness is that in the past week, credit transactions and outstanding funds released by money shops have repeatedly failed to be repaid as scheduled, and several businesses have been forced to go bankrupt, owing tens of thousands of dollars in shop funds. With so many bad debts accumulating, money shops are naturally greatly affected. Those who are affluent and have sufficient bills will inevitably choose the best and carefully screen and select, and will not relax. This has caused a great relationship in the market atmosphere. Fortunately, money shops now hold a cautious and contractionist doctrine for lending, so they are not as large as before. Even if there are accumulated debts, the amount must be limited or there is no danger of affecting the overall situation.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Securities and Public Bonds for September Term Were Suspended from Auction Yesterday <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>November futures open for pretense trading today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Securities Exchange stopped trading for the September term because it needed to prepare for delivery, while November futures opened for trading today. Therefore, yesterday there was only one type of futures transaction, the October term. The market needed to prepare for delivery, and the bond market environment was extremely dull. As a result, there were few buy and sell transactions, and the market was unusually deserted. Although there were many spot transactions, there were also very few transactions. The trend of each bond price was also due to the clear market conditions. The supply and demand situation was rarely different, and the price only rose and fell by several corners. The price will not rise or fall greatly before the end-of-month delivery. It is estimated that the total futures turnover for the day was only 2,995,000 yuan, and the spot turnover was 17,000 yuan. It is also said that the Securities Exchange will conduct the settlement before delivery today for the purpose of handling the clearing of accounts yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e190">Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets are Weak and Lifeless <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly flat, but the situation is still quite solid because a portion of large households are counteracting with huge bag quotas, so the market atmosphere is stable. However, the world yarn and cotton market is still weak, so the Chaozhou gang and Japanese merchants have a strong idea of shorting. However, a certain yarn manufacturer is still holding on tightly, and a large portion has purchased due to the optimistic situation, so the market situation is still strong, with occasional rises and falls, and actual sales are relatively light. According to a survey by Japanese merchants, there are still 120-130,000 bales in stock. However, in these few days, various parties have purchased about 20-30,000 bales of cotton yarn. The next step will still depend on the situation, and the current need will be the advance and retreat.</p>
<p>Falling nearly two taels, in one person's bid, the opening was flat. Because American cotton has been trending down for days, small vendors are selling out, and each is falling two or three cents. In the second and third bids, large households are pulling shorts, and there is a slight recovery. In the end, each is falling 2, 3, 5, cents. The market atmosphere is still sluggish in the afternoon, but the two households, Xincheng and Ruida, are buying very actively. This month is the last day. At closing, small vendors are selling out, and the price is suddenly falling 2 taels and 2 qian. Distant months are flat. The total turnover for the day is estimated at 35,000 bales. It is estimated that Xincheng bought 5,100 bales, Ruida 2,800 bales, Shenyu 1,000 bales, Rongxing 850 bales, Zhenda 850 bales, and Gongtai 850 bales. The rest are from 400 to 550 bales. Gengfeng sold 1,450 bales, Yuantai 3,400 bales, Changfeng 1,650 bales, Tianchang 1,300 bales, Dafeng 950 bales, Hengda 750 bales, Daji 650 bales, and Maoji 650 bales. The others are from 350 to 600 bales. The closing prices for the one-person bid are recorded below.</p>

It is estimated that 1,862 bales were bought by various gangs throughout the day, and 155 bales were imported by peers. The market is flat. 210 bales were imported by customers from Sichuan, 45 bales from Guangdong, 65 bales from Xiamen, 600 bales from Qingdao, 120 bales from the mainland, 100 bales from Tianjin, 257 bales from Yunnan, 110 bales from Hankou, 115 bales from Shantou, and 95 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Cotton Market is Stable and Unchanged <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending weak, mainly because the American cotton price is unsteady. Various factories have purchased large quotas of Indian cotton, so people's hearts are weak. A portion is selling off in large quantities, but mainland merchants are absorbing the volumes due to the high purchase price. Another portion is becoming more determined because they see the yarn market as stable. Therefore, although foreign cotton is gradually showing new low prices, the local cotton market is still able to support it. However, when large quantities of Indian and American cotton purchased by Chinese and foreign factories arrive in Shanghai in November and December, a major change will occur.</p>
<p>Han Standard continues to fall. The Han Standard market opened in the morning with a poor American cotton and weak conditions. There were more sellers, and each fell by two cents to five fen. The market atmosphere was flat and weak in the afternoon, and there were no major ups and downs in each month. The total turnover for the day is estimated at 29,700 dan. It is estimated that Lichang sold 5,400 dan, Yukang 1,400 dan, Jifeng 1,000 dan, Xiesheng 1,400 dan, and the rest were from 900 dan to 800 dan. Shenchang bought 2,400 dan, Yikang 6,400 dan, Yuanda 2,300 dan, and the rest were from 1,000 to 1,200 dan. The closing prices for the Han Standard are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Northern Market Noon Sales Are Slightly Set</p>
<p>There were only more than 20 sources in the Northern Gate yesterday, and the sales continued to be sluggish, so the spot quotations of each stall were all slightly down by half a yuan in the morning. Although more than 20 houses continued to arrive at noon, the weather suddenly turned cloudy, and people's hearts became better, and the stomachs of the stores on this street had already fallen sharply in the rice market. The price then returned to the upper corner, and the market conditions were slightly set, but compared to the previous day, it was still downstream. It is estimated that the high opening of Xin Geng in the west was 16 and a half yuan, and the special top was at 16 yuan and 7 jiao. The new goods from the east were scarce, and the Zhunze sheep Dujian were all at 13 yuan to 12 yuan, the Port Jiao was 12 and a half yuan, and the customer Jiao was above 11 yuan. The afternoon closing was about a small 3 jiao. The white yuan returned to a small half yuan, and the high opening was 17 and a half yuan.</p>
<p>There were still more than 40 rivers to Shanghai South, and the sales on this street became more sluggish. The Changbang Xin Geng fell slightly by half a yuan and opened at 16 yuan, while the new Geng from Suzhou, Tongshan, and Kunshan fell sharply by more than one yuan. The high-quality goods were only 14 and a half yuan, and the second-highest were 13 yuan. The Nanbang goods and fragrant Geng also followed the general trend and went downstream. The top goods were 14 yuan and 6 jiao, and the lotus root tip market had become extremely sluggish, so the spot quotations returned to 12 and a half yuan, down 7 or 8 jiao. The sheep Dujian saw a frantic drop of 6 jiao to 9 jiao. The highest overall market was 12 yuan. The decline in this area was sharper than in the Northern Gate.</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Market for Low-Grade Indica Rice Remains Stagnant <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Arrivals from Origin Increase Daily, Prices Gradually Decline</p>
<p>There are still no transactions for foreign rice. A small amount of short-grain rice stored in the market is suppressed by the sales of low-grade indica rice, making it difficult to sell. There is a continuous arrival of low-grade indica rice, with 3,000 to 5,000 bags transported by trains, and a considerable amount of brown rice as well. Therefore, the market remains sluggish. However, it is still difficult to move low-grade indica rice. The other day, only the Guangdong group shipped 800 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice at a price of eleven yuan to ten yuan and four jiao. The Ningbo group handled 686 bags of Hunan glutinous rice at a price of nine yuan and six jiao to nine yuan and three jiao. Most of the Jiangxi rice was handled by local merchants, totaling 700 bags of early-season machine-milled rice at a price of eleven yuan and one or two jiao to ten yuan and eight or nine jiao. There were also 142 bags of late-season machine-milled rice priced at twelve yuan and two jiao, and 27 bags of premium machine-milled rice priced at thirteen yuan and three jiao. There were also 87 bags of brown rice priced at eleven yuan and eight jiao. All the rice was of inferior quality, hence the lower prices. Yesterday, arrivals decreased slightly, and because the cost of production for merchants was high and it was extremely difficult to make a profit on transportation, most merchants were unwilling to easily sell at low prices. However, with Mr. Du supporting various out-of-town merchants and no further handling by local merchants, the market remained soft due to the standoff between the two sides. The entire market was handled by local merchants importing 300 bags of early-season Jiangxi rice and 50 bags of late-season machine-milled rice, with prices similar to the previous day. No further handling was done by Guangdong or Ningbo merchants. In addition to Jiangxi rice, brown rice from Nanjing and Anhui was transported by train. Most of this brown rice was directly sent to rice mills for whitening and then sold in the local market. Therefore, there were very few transactions at the exchange. One hundred and thirty bags of Nanjing brown rice were sold at a price of eight yuan and four and a half jiao.</p>

<p>Prices in Producing Areas Also Reported to be Gradually Decreasing</p>
<p>Market prices in foreign rice producing areas were also reported to be gradually decreasing. After Shanghai merchants purchased 500 tons of 7 taels 5 qian and 67/1000 of a qian of Saigon rice in the previous week, they ordered another 750 tons due to the decreasing fixed price, which was deemed suitable for local sales. Subsequently, they continued to order a total of nearly 30,000 bags. The lowest price was 7 taels and 3 qian.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market suddenly turned downward again. Although telegrams from foreign wheat sources reported a slight firmness, the market sentiment turned soft due to sales by out-of-town merchants and factory disposals. The prices of all months declined steadily. However, large factories maintained near-term prices in the afternoon. Therefore, near-term prices only decreased by a few li, while far-term prices fell by two to three fen. At present, the flour market is truly difficult to predict. The foreign flour and wheat ordered for the first time next month on the fifth will soon arrive in Shanghai. Currently, spot sales are weak, and actual sales groups are mostly watching. Some short-term speculators have already taken a closing position. Therefore, in this special situation, flour prices may still change. The closing result, compared to the previous day, was down 7.5 li in September, 2.25 fen in October, 2.5 fen in November, December, and February, and 2.75 fen in January.</p>

<p>Yesterday, wheat futures went down across the board. The current month was the last trading month, and the bulls, due to frequent shortages of spot wheat, a sluggish flour market, and the pressure from foreign flour and wheat, had no intention of taking delivery and aimed to close out their positions. They sold off in the market in batches. Seeing the bulls' offers, the bears watched and bought in. Therefore, although the opening price in the morning was still between 4 liang 7 qian and 3 to 4 fen, it steadily declined afterward. The closing price was squeezed down to 4 liang 6 qian and 3 fen, down more than 1 qian and 1 fen. This kind of squeeze on bulls nearing the delivery date is also rare. However, after this transaction, the number of deliveries this month will be very few. Far-term months declined as well, due to the lower flour prices, the lack of spot wheat transactions, and the impact of the sharp decline in the near term. The closing price was down 1 qian and 1 fen for the current month, and 7 fen for the October, November, January, and February terms. The December term was down 6 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai silk market remained quiet. The overseas market for all raw silk has been almost completely taken over by rayon and cheap Japanese silk. There is no news of Chinese silk. Shanghai telegrams were not forwarded. Only Yongxing imported five bales of Jin Sangye brand top-grade 13-15 denier raw silk at a price of over 980 taels, and the market was generally silent.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Gaozhuang Zhenmei green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi and other regions continued to be imported by Baochang, Yongxing, and other firms. Transactions were still active. Among them, top-grade early-spring teas were offered at 225 taels. However, ordinary Zhenmei tea remained sluggish. Large merchants from various regions were still selling off in small quantities. Needle-shaped and fine-leaved teas also continued to be traded, but selling prices were generally trending downward.</p>

<p>Qingdao and Tianjin Still Actively Searching, Sichuan and Hubei Also Active</p>
<p>The local cotton cloth market remained stable. Yesterday, there was a slight improvement in actual sales, with the local market being the most active. Over 200 pieces of 11-pound coarse cloth and over 100 pieces of 13-pound coarse cloth were traded, all wholesaled to inland areas. Fifty pieces of 18-pound "Sky" brand Niuzhuang Yingkou cloth were handled at a price of 8 liang and 7.5 fen. Fine twill was in short supply. Due to active searches by inland merchants, there is a high probability of continued price increases. The market for undyed fine cloth has been stagnant since sales declined, and it has remained quiet. As the end of September approaches, the market is becoming increasingly stagnant and stable. The Tianjin group handled over 100 pieces of coarse twill yesterday, and prices showed a slight increase.</p>
<p>Eastern goods continued to rise yesterday. Both Qingdao and Tianjin merchants were still actively searching for goods, and Sichuan and Hankou merchants were also highly active, resulting in a situation of supply not meeting demand. Fine serge rose by another 2.5 to 5 li. Lakeside Pavilion Joy has been sold at 2 qian and 9 fen. Zijin Mountain Baizi also requires 2 qian and 8.5 fen. Sales of wool-silk cloth are also active. San Matou cloth is priced at 2 liang and 2.5 qian, and the available stock is already limited. San goods have reached the same price. Straight tribute woolen cloth and satin are in short supply, and prices are high, leading to a temporary boom.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous News: The Shanghai North-South Money Shops will be closed for one day on October 1st. The Gold Exchange will also be closed on that day. All cash public bonds for the October term will be resolved on the 2nd, as announced to the market yesterday. Also, due to the Mid-Autumn Festival in the Lunar Calendar (October 6th), all banks have pre-agreed to close for one day as usual, and the Gold Exchange will also be closed. Business will resume as usual on the 7th.</p>

<p>Shanghai Market News The Yulun Silk and Satin Bureau on the east side of Wangping Street, Nanjing Road, announces that the bureau's official opening grand sale for one month is coming to an end. Recently, customers have been extremely crowded. All newly arrived autumn clothing materials are also sold at low prices. In addition to price cuts, high-quality real silk handkerchiefs are also given as gifts. It is said that goods are especially cheaper on Sundays. The Meida Silk and Satin Foreign Goods Company on Fourth Malu Road announces that the company specializes in various silk and satin goods and has long been famous in society. Since holding a large auction with full-length fabrics plus 20-30%, the business has been booming for the past 20-30 days, and business is extremely prosperous, it is said. The Ford Motor Company announces that Mr. McCarthy, the manager of the company in Danhua Wharf, has invented a new method to prove the economy of using Ford cars. Mr. McCarthy said that people who want to buy cars often consider the value of the car and the cost of maintaining the car. Such people must not want to waste money. I first took a savings box from the bank and tied it to the front of the car’s splash board with the silver slot facing upwards. This place is in front of the driver and within sight of the buyer. When driving for one mile, I stopped and took one cent from my purse and put it into the savings box. The car buyer did not pay attention to it. Then, every two or three miles, I put a cent in as before, and when the car traveled five miles, I put two cents into the savings box again. At this time, the car buyer felt very strange. Finally, I told the car buyer that this is the money saved by using a Ford car, and explained the calculation method in detail, and thus obtained the purchase of the car, it is said. Lao Jinlong Foreign Company announces that the White Orchid perfume managed by the company is a French product, fragrant and rich, with a lasting fragrance. It has the fragrance of a king and has the effect of refreshing the mind. The price is low and the quality is good. It is the best in the market of fragrant products. Major foreign grocery stores and major pharmacies all sell it, it is said. Gongli Socks Factory announces that the factory has specially set up a retail and wholesale department on Nanjing Road Hongmiao to meet the needs of customers. The student brand silk stockings issued are cheap and of good quality. During the opening period, there are special discounts. There are also more than a thousand kinds of cosmetics for sale, all produced by famous German factories, it is said. Theater News The World Grand Theater at the corner of Qingyun Road, Zhabei, announces that since the beginning of autumn, every time it has screened top-quality famous films, the seats have been full. The glamorous and sensual love film "Circus Woman" of the Dahua Lily Company will be shown at the theater starting today (27th). The film stars Zhou Wenzhu and Zhang Wenqing, with mysterious and sensual performances, exciting plots, and wonderful photography that can fascinate the audience, it is said. Paris Grand Theater announces that from today, the Monte Carlo Dance Troupe, which is famous all over the world, will be invited to perform amazing skills and moving songs and dances. The troupe has a large number of talents and superb skills. It is welcomed everywhere when performing in various countries. The theater, in order to satisfy the eyes and ears of the people of Shanghai, spent a lot of effort to hire it to come to Shanghai to perform, and also screened the hilarious detective film "Who is the Murderer" starring the king of comedy, Raymond Griffith. The laughter is rich and can be called a masterpiece, it is said. Fudan Film Company announces that the company's "Twenty-Four Knights of the Jianghu" has released four episodes, and since its release, it has been praised by all parties. Now the fifth episode is about to be completed. The heroine of this episode is Ms. Hu Shan, whose reputation is comparable to that of her sister Hu Die, and she is especially good at performing martial arts dramas. This time, Mr. Yu Boyan has repeatedly suggested directing, and the results are very impressive. Other aspects such as the greatness of the scenery, the exquisiteness of the costumes, and the twists and turns of the plot are all enough to make the audience pleasing to the eye. When it is released, I hope everyone will not miss it, it is said. Youlian Film Company announces that the company's well-known "Wild River Heroine" film is now, at the request of all parties, allowed to combine the first two episodes, a total of 20 large volumes, at the Central Grand Theater for three days starting from the 30th of this month.

<p>Youth Corner Impressions of a Trip to the North Su Ling (VI) A City of Snow Gray skies are like the face of a widow covered in black veil. The pale blue, hazy sun is like the bewildered eyes of a virgin. The cold wind patrols, and snowflakes scatter sparsely, ah. The city trembles. The high heels of women dance on the slippery sidewalks. The beards of men with beards and their high leather collars are frosted. I mingle alone in the crowd, my heart and legs trembling. I have always been someone who likes to live in the city. In Shanghai, although I was unemployed for years and struggled daily in poverty, I never left Shanghai. It wasn't because I dreamed of making a big development or a big plan in Shanghai. I didn't want to leave city life because a mysterious, trembling force lurking in the city seduced me. But I was willing to be tempted and led by it. In the metropolis, there are complex and different kinds of "appearances," and the center of the metropolis is so chaotic and conflicting. So we live in it as if we are sitting in the middle of a symphony being played. Perhaps some people will laugh at me for having an empty pocket, or even a hungry stomach, and still wanting to walk alone on such a fleshy, material street. Yes, but how do they know that my spiritual gain is greater than my physical gain? Before going north, I was worried that I would not be able to live a city life after coming north. But what I feel now is that this snowy city has a strange taste. That is, I can't see the desert and the black forest that I wanted to see, but I don't lose anything. I sit on the chairs for people to rest on beside the sidewalk in front of the big department store windows, watching the night gradually fall. The sky changed from gray to black. The lights came on. Sparse snowflakes still fell, glittering like white flower petals under the streetlights. The music of the dance halls and cafes sounded, and this sound trembled in the snowy night. The number of pedestrians on the street increased at night, but I was very surprised that this was not a concession or a foreign country. Why couldn't I see Chinese people around me? Indeed, the broad minds of the Chinese people are admirable. The Chinese people also generously give land to these large numbers of stateless White Russians to live on. Look, isn't Harbin entirely a White Russian country? Most of those big stores are run by them. The ignorant Chinese people mutter "Ah, Lao Maozi" when they see White Russians and are afraid of them. Yes, aren't the Red Russians who constantly shoot at China with machine guns and cannons at the border born the same as these White Russians? Confused thoughts invaded my brain. I drank half a glass of vodka in a small food shop to dispel my thoughts and warm my cold body. So I drunkenly crossed the wide street, turned into a dark alley, and went home to comfort Mi Luo. Today is Sunday morning, and Zeng brother came to see me. The autumn wind seemed to have already blown from the sea, once blowing the thin blanket on my lonely couch, making me wake up in the middle of the night with cold. But in the past day or two, it has grown its fierce flames again, clearly displaying the power of a tiger. The pavilion faces east, and the sun shines early in the morning. Who can bear to sit here in boredom? I went out with Brother Tang and walked north on Sichuan Road. After wandering on the street for a while, I bought a newspaper and casually flipped through it, walking to the front of the Shanghai Grand Theater, arousing the interest in watching a movie. "Walking around aimlessly is too boring and hot. Let's watch a two-cent movie. No matter what it shows." "Okay, my treat. Two cents is very cheap. Maybe there is philosophy besides the movie for you to study, brother," Zeng said with a smile, his long hair waving. Walking inside, it didn't take long for the scenes to start playing before the audience. Because there was a lot of slapstick, there were bursts of laughter, but the story seemed very mediocre. I still remember a point in the whole thing: "There was an old woman who relied on her daughter's favor with the mistress and lived with her daughter, able to enjoy some leisure. However, there was one thing that she always felt very sad about, that is, her husband had been missing for a long time, making her stare at his photo in a daze day and night. Sometimes she would even crazily mistake passersby. She tried her best to ask people to inquire everywhere, but she could not get any real news. Later, her daughter fell in love with someone, and the lover was a capable inventor who gave the old woman a lot of comfort in all pleasures, but she missed her husband all the more. Until her last death, she still shouted wildly that she wanted to find her husband." It was almost twelve o'clock when the movie ended. Zeng and I squeezed out of the crowd. Our eyes, which had been in the dark for two hours, could not open when we saw the sun. It seemed that Zeng's face looked a little strange, but I didn't pay attention to it. Walking to the intersection of Bazi Road, we took a tram back. As soon as we sat down, he said to me sadly, "I'm going to get a haircut this afternoon and want to take a photo."</p>
<p>Page 26</p>
<p>"What's the use?" "Mother wants to see me. I haven't been back for four years." His voice was sad. "It's really inconvenient to travel back and forth to your distant hometown." "Yesterday I received a express letter saying that my mother is seriously ill and wants to see a photo of me, her beloved son, whom she hasn't seen for four years." I secretly looked at Zeng. I didn't dare to say anything more, and there were no suitable words to comfort him. I could only remain silent, letting the tram creak forward in the wind. It wasn't until after dinner that Zeng said he had something to do and left. In the evening, I wrote a letter to comfort him. "Brother Zeng, I expected that you would be plunged into complete sorrow today. Indeed, it is such a heartbreaking thing for a wandering son to be away from home and for a loving mother to be waiting anxiously at the door. Moreover, she is old, sick, and in danger, with only the hope of seeing a photo of her beloved son whom she hasn't seen for four years. We have known each other for two years, and we have only shared the same sorrows. We have had heart-to-heart talks late at night and have given me long poems in return. Especially after reading the original manuscript of your entire 'Sister's Remains,' I have gained a great understanding. You, the poet, have sung of the colors of sorrow: 'On a face with unexpressed sorrow, countless haggard lines have been added, symbolizing decline, disease, old age, and death.' 'Weak shoulders deeply bear the heavy cross of the past five years, traveling in the desolate desert with melancholy.' 'Beautiful youth plays a hazy and indistinguishable funeral music, eliminating the bitterness of life. The sorrowful and mournful dirge sends my surging and endless heart's blood, spurting out endless tears.' 'Now I am separated from my beloved hometown and sinking into the abyss of a foreign land.' Indeed, you have completely and nakedly exposed all the sorrows of a poet. However, I can understand that you are definitely not moaning without illness. There is an unspeakable pain in this, and I am afraid that only those who suffer from the same disease can appreciate it. Recently, the banner of national literature and art has been grandly displayed, and you have undoubtedly rushed to the front line of the Chinese literary world and bravely become a pioneer. Your great poems have suddenly taken a new direction, abandoning the praise of the bright moon and the clear breeze and singing the glory of our Chinese nation. This clearly shows that you have grasped the correct thinking and have begun to embark on a great future. Four years away from home is nothing. The responsibility in the future is even greater. If your loving mother knows that you are improving and working hard, she will surely smile when she sees your thin face, even if an unfortunate event occurs. At the same time, look at me, alone and unable to pursue the joy of parents and the laughter of siblings in the white poplar woods. How can I not be sad? However, I have realized that sadness is futile. I have no ill-gotten wealth to offer to your old mother, nor any vain glory to comfort your old mother. Everything is in the journey of wandering, relying on a surge of life's hot blood and working hard. Only an upward and unremitting heart can fly back to your hometown from afar and lie in your old mother's thoughts. I will give you your articles again: 'This unfortunate life, this desolate and helpless surroundings, was not it already destined on the fate stone pillars of the previous two centuries? Joy needs to be pursued with courage, and happiness needs to be seized with effort. Historical facts tell me this, and I feel it.' 'The past has become an elusive illusion, and the future may contain a glimmer of bright hope. From now on, I can only gather my inherent energy and move forward to fight against the darkness that prevents the free progress of mankind and seize the national glory shining in front of the times.' We need to move forward, and young people need guidance to improve. Here, I can pray that your old mother has recovered her health. As long as you work hard." White Hair Chun Originally, who can eternally grasp the enjoyment of happy youth and escape the arrival of the image of old age? The giant wheel of time is turning ruthlessly. Will it allow anyone's request and slow down its urging? Can the flourishing of plants and trees in spring be exempt from the withering of autumn? This is the decision of natural conditions and also the creation of natural conditions. Then, isn't the growth of my white hair ordinary and ordinary again? But I feel that the decision of natural conditions is ultimately natural. It is not a standardless scale, and I have surpassed this standard. I believe that people of my age should not have white hair, but like my actions, I cannot escape this sign. Oh, this white hair that indicates the extinguishing and fading of my youth, this white hair. In fact, it is not something to be sad about, and in reality, I will not be sad about the discovery of white hair. What I think about is the changes in life in this year. Although the changes in life in this year are not painful or traumatic, they are worth eternally commemorating and eternally commemorating. I don't know how, at dawn today, when I was still hazy, Brother Zhi suddenly discovered a precious thing and pulled my hand and said, "You have white hair." "Do I have white hair?" I asked doubtfully. "Yes, and there are several." "Then can you pluck them out for me?" Brother Zhi agreed and lay down on the bed to pluck them out for me. After plucking for a long time, one root came out. At that time, I looked at it for a long time and couldn't say anything for a while. Finally, I trembled and forced a smiling face and said like a prayer, "This is a white hair worth commemorating, oh, white hair. I want to keep it." "………………………" However, what about Brother Zhi? He also has a lot of white hair. What does this represent for him? For years, I don't know why I started to get involved in the world. So my heart has also changed since then. I understand very well that my age is too childish, but when I repeatedly think that "childish age is a rice bucket," I feel at ease. I only ask myself to strive. As for what the results are, then it can be said that it has made me know a little more about the world and at the same time has made me spend my youth. Standing South Sun Photography I remember Brother Zhi saying unintentionally one night that my youth was coming to an end, but I hadn't enjoyed anything in my youth. Naturally, I had nothing to say to him and only asked in response, "How do you know that my youth is coming to an end?" Brother Zhi couldn't help but feel very sentimental and said, "You are the same as me. I was drawn into the vortex of the world at a very early age, so my senses seem too sensitive. Now you have also been drawn into the vortex of the world at a very early age. So-called youthful enjoyment has not been bestowed upon you, and you will have no time to take care of future youthful enjoyment because you have already been drawn into the vortex of the world. As for our depression, because of the advancement of the trend of thought of the times, it will always be depression." "Yes, regarding our depression, because our thinking is revolutionary and progressive, our nerves will never be invaded by numbness, but on the other hand, the realistic environment exposes ferocity everywhere. Therefore, this kind of depression may be a good phenomenon. My youthful outing and my original desires are no longer something I must pursue. I only want to fight for life, go to fight for life." Speaking of this, everyone was silent and there was really nothing more to say. There were indeed many pieces of advice that Brother Zhi gave me, and they were indeed unforgettable in this life. Since I recovered slightly from my illness and came out, I have been with Brother Zhi every day and listened to his instructions. Although today I discovered white hair because of an incident and made me recall everything in the past as if I had reordered an old account, this is probably a sign that I need to stand on the path of a strong will to live and fight with everything, to fight with everything. I should not entrust great expectations to mirror flowers and water moon. The power of the environment can indeed harm me, but I will never be willing to be dominated by the environment. I should conquer the environment to create what I want to create. White hair, oh, white hair, is the enlightenment of my will, the consciousness of battle.</p>
