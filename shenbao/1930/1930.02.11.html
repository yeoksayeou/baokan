<h3>五院長朂勉軍人</h3>
<p>中央根本政策爲和平統一</p>
<p>望全國軍人力行四項要旨</p>
<p>（南京）國府五院長吉十日發吿軍人書、原文如下、</p>
<p>自北伐完成以後、中央所樹立之根本政策、而舉全力以謀實現者、即日和平統一、蓋非統一、不足以充實國之實力、而躋民族於獨立平等之域、非和平不足以恢復社會之元氣、而與人民以休養生息之機、故欲謀國家之獨立當先謀國家之統一、若欲求國家永久和平、亦當於眞實統一中求得也、中央内念人民之苦痛、外顧國際之風雲、知和平統一、爲中國人民求幸褔民族謀獨立之惟一出路、故即以和平統一、爲政府之根本大策、一切施施、均以此爲鵠矢、一切努力、均以此爲依歸、此事實昭著、而爲國人所共知者也、不幸中央力謀和平統一之時、迭出欖亂和平破壞统一之變亂、自去春桂系軍閥叛變以後、繼之以西北軍之作亂、以及唐逆生智、張逆發奎、先後之背叛、致使甫吿完成之統一、迭受破壞、甫行實現之和平、屢擾亂幾、如一片嫩芽、爲狂風急雨所摧殘、曙光爲烏雲黑霧所閉蔽、此實國家之不幸、亦即國民所深爲痛心者也、然而叛變軍閥、雖相繼發生、而不旋踵之間、均次第消滅、此即事實證明、無論軍閥如何攪亂和平、而和平終必實現無論軍閥如何破壞統一、而統一終必完成、亦即事實說明、凡背叛中央、以圖破壞統一擾亂和平者、終必消滅、當桂系軍閥叛變之際、擁有兩湖兩廣之地盤勢力、不可謂不厚、然而討逆軍不費一矢、不發一彈、即平定武漢、逆軍潰崩、於是桂系軍閥、因而消滅、馮玉祥部以西北十餘萬之衆、入寇中原、反抗中央、當時聲勢浩大、竟經登封臨汝一戰、逆軍即全綫潰竄、主力損失殆盡、唐逆生智、當浦口兵變之時、移兵作亂、危脅中央、然而不踰一月、即隻身潛逃、全部繳械、張發奎聯合桂系除孽、進犯廣東、經討逆軍一繫、即狼竄豕奔、全體瓦解、歷觀叛逆軍閥之末路、即可知凡反抗黨國、以破壞和平統一之政策者、末有不趨於覆滅、此種寳貴之敎訓、我全體軍人、宜深自體會而警惕也、叛逆之徒之所以甘於叛逆者、實基於其封建的軍閥心理、即視其軍隊爲個人之軍隊、其勢力爲個人之勢力、而不知一切軍隊、皆國家之軍隊、一切軍事勢力、皆爲國家所有、因此一念之差、遂致百刦不回、蓋旣以其軍隊爲個人勢力、則一面旣顧併吞别部勢力、而擴張自己之勢力、一面又惟恐自己之勢力爲别部勢力所消滅、於是或挑撥離間、使别人互相衝突、而從中漁利、或竟明目張胆、稱兵作亂、殊不知此種行動、不僅禍國殃民、而且實爲自殺之道、叛逆者之漸次滅亡、即其明鑒、根據過去經騐、同人等甚願我全體軍人、尤其偶犯過誤之軍人、更望其力行下列各項、切冀恢復其革命人格與歷史也、</p>
<p>第一须視軍隊爲國家之武力、不應視軍隊爲個人之勢力、則其結果、必視自己軍隊以外之軍隊、爲與自己敵對之勢力、而加以防範或嫉視、於是或聯甲以防乙、或聯丙以倒丁、縱横捭闔、糾紛以生、此不但禍及國家、亦且害及己身、若以軍隊爲國家之武力、則一切軍隊、均爲自己之友軍、親愛互助之不暇、何致互相仇視、互相猜疑、故革命軍人、應以自己所率之軍隊、爲國家之武力、此不僅足以救國、且足以自救、</p>
<p>第二須經保障國家生存之中、求本身之生存、不宜犠牲國家之生存、而求一已之倖免、皮之不存、毛將安附古有明訓、人所共知、如國家長期陷於分崩離柝之狀態、而不得統一、則整個國家、將爲外國所消滅、一部軍人、焉能倖存、故任何軍人、必擁護中央、鞏固統一、使國基日固、然後本身之生存、始克保障、如果挑撥離間、幸災樂禍、使别人互相衝突、而其在别人衝突之中、求一時之苟存、未有不隨國家之淪亡而覆滅者也、</p>
<p>第三、須不存利用别人之心、而亦不可爲别人所利用、革命軍人、首重人格、利用别人作工具、以謀一巳之利私、此乃無賴之所爲、革命軍人亦不宜出此、即使他人一時爲我利用、久後必發覺察及、他人覺察爲我利用、對我之怨恨、必甚於一切之仇讐、如此循環報復、豈得幸存、此乃一切反動派及往昔北洋軍閥之慣技、若用於今日革命時代、未有能逃滅亡之覆轍、然而國家因此之損失、亦伊於胡底、故即爲一巳謀、利用别人爲工具、亦非善策、至甘心受人利用而爲虎作倀者、則其心更不可問也、</p>
<p>第四、只求問心無愧、不畏人之滅我、歷來叛變軍閥、當其叛跡未著之時、無不惴惴焉惟恐人之消滅也、其所以有此心理者、實由於居心不可問也、如果存心無愧、又何致有此疑慮耶、公道自在人心正義未至淪亡、我果誠心爲國效忠革命則無所往而不可、如果無故而欲消滅别人、必爲公道所不許、正義所不容、故吾儕只須居心作事、光明磊落、不必多所疑猜、而自驚以伯有也、</p>
<p>以上四項、爲全體軍人所應注意、尤盼覺悟而力行之、綜上所述、可以一語概括之、即吾人居心行事、應處處爲公、不宜稍存私念是也、爲公則敵可化爲友、爲私則友變爲仇、爲公則可得人民之愛護而生存、爲私則將受國法之制裁而消滅、存亡之分、榮辱之别、全繫於爲公爲私之一念、差之毫釐、失之千里、鑒叛逆滅亡之覆轍、我袍澤不可不深自警惕也、中央之態度、亦有須爲我全體軍人吿者、中央始終以總理天下爲公之懐、貫澈和平統一之旨、旣無絲毫利用某方消滅某方之心、更不至受某方利用、以抑制某方、中央所知、且必力行者、惟在抑制内戰、實施編遣、以完成統一、保障和平、故凡稱兵作亂、擾亂和平者、中央必根據人民之要</p>

<p>求、以之爲人民之公敵且爲謀國家之統一與獨立、萬不得已、而討伐之、過去一年間、自討伐桂系軍閥、以至於撲滅唐逆生智均不外此旨、如有澈悟前非、切戒内戰、共同一致、力謀和平者、則中央自必一視同仁、且當謀保全其革命之歷史與地位、是乃同人等所籲求禱祝者也夫兵凶器也、戰危事也、統一爲獨立之本、</p>

<p>今日日電發表大連商品交易所之疑獄事件。該事件即日人所謂因政系謀士策動所引起滿洲財界大波瀾之事件。亦即五大賄案發現後第一重大之事件也。該事件初經關東廳禁止日報登載。今始解禁。記者以其與我全國人有大關繫。故一論其原委</p>
<p>據日電所發表者。謂大連股分商品交易所理事長原田耕一。任事以來。因財界不振。營業失敗。於是由股東發起。令理事長及董事辭職。官廳檢騐賬册。竟發現原因在任時。有擅用公司股票之事。據公司方面調查。該交易所所有之股票幾被用盡悉以該金欵投資於東京大阪及大連各市場原田等雖力辯爲非因私慾而擅自處理。然一般人對於該金欵之用途。頗起疑問現將原田以下有關係人下獄擬治以擅用公司股欵之罪</p>
<p>日電所發表者。大要如以上所述。其中最主要之該金欵究。用於何途。則迄未宣布然吾人於數日前即已知此金欵用途係用之於販賣毒品以禍我華人者也此其證據見之於曾經報載之世界社通訊謂大連檢察廳爲此案搜索該交易所理事等諸人之宅獲犯罪證據多種。此諸人皆藉賣虊商名以密販毒虊爲專業前數年密輸人之嗎啡鴉片海羅英等。被發覺者達四百六十餘萬日元民國十七年該諸人與田中内閣某大臣關東廳諸大官密輸嗎啡等。約一百三十八萬日元。又據犯人自供。去年由某國輸入海羅英等四次。與關東廳諸大官分配利益。因參加人分配不匀。遂被發覺。其實情如此。近年來日人販賣毒虊。即以大連爲總機關。由此分運於天津瀋陽石家莊吉林等各地。試問其遺害於我國人爲何如。竊謂日本政府誠欲表示公道於世界糾正華人之感情凈化現在之政界。則對此事件宜不稍掩飾澈底整理。不當視爲内部政爭問題而僅治以侵佔股欵之罪。我國人對此問題。亦宜如何注意。以防止毒禍於未來也</p>

<p>記在民國七年二月。從軍嘉陵。山水佳勝。人物秀美。雖在干戈驛騷之中。談讌風流。杜少陵之石匱詩。吳道子之嘉陵江。詩中有書。又何讓焉。客有言錦屏山之勝者。雙柑斗酒。往聽黄鸝之聲。百樹雜花。喜看羣鶯之舞。此中頗富詩趣。豈意山下爲黄金之窟宅耶。臨流覓渡。或將歸於鹿門。斷笟尋沙。此之所謂掏户。千家聚處。五旬輪流。雖取之不多。而義在有次。蓋嘉陵江出金沙。淘户始於唐代。一日二日。未獲握掬之盈。千斯萬斯。將無義利之辯。朝日初出。畫角高喧。旣集其羣。先後自有次序。乃舉其笟。得失莫許紛紜。觀其投網之時。衆力畢起。負載以去。捶煉斯勤。沙石化飛。精金遂出。一旬所得。不逾毫分。積而久之。遂至千萬。至若天賜之福。人習於勞。按旬而來。舉網必得。不憚寒暑。何恤風雨之期。傳之子孫。無問他山之助。此淘户之富者。亦有天不受寳。命不如人。前者滿載而歸。後者垂棄以返。此雖江流有定。不遇無緣。足見爐火空勞。多關薄命。此淘户之貧者。故觀於淘户之貧富。而富貴在天。古訓昭昭。於斯益信。</p>
<p>今者金價飛騰。銀根奇落。將爲救亡之計。必有開源之圖。臨淵羡魚者。何如結網之得實。亡羊補牢者。何如固圉之爲先。且美國之富以多金。而日本之金已解禁。我國雖爲用銀之國。藏富於山。未始不產金也。漠河之金。歲產旣巨。金沙江之產。更爲無窮。是果提倡有方。儲藏得法。又何患於金貴而爲他國之所乘耶。倘云臨渴掘并。終有得水之時。畫餅充飢。足愈枵腹之病。東三省之狗頭金。吾聞爲軍閥所據而私之矣。嘉陵江之淘金千餘户。吾見爲山盗之所刦而盡去矣。故中國之今日。不患國際交易之金日以貴。而患在國内產金之區。政府無保護之道。桃花溢上。却金之館猶在乎。金坑之金。何以不掘也。（桃花隘屬浙江麗水縣）楠木圍中。寳藏之府猶存乎。金鑛之金。何以不取也。（楠木圍屬湖北巴東縣）此外如雲南之南猛北猛。四川之萬石坪。新疆之東奇魯斯。皆產金之奥區。惜哉其棄而不取也。茲因記嘉陵江之淘金。隨筆附及之。　更有進者國際交易。以金爲平準之需。中國立國於世界之上。如之何其不改金本位也。度支部曾有虚金本位三十八兩之議。湯明水亦有金幣之規定。今者鑒於市塲之危急。商戰之猛烈。金本位之施行。不可遲也。金鑛之開採與保護。不可緩也。果以吾言爲信。必更詳之。以促其實現焉。</p>
<h3>首都新談</h3>
<p>— 春華</p>
<p>鐵道部新屋已築成十之五。純爲宮殿式。屋頂髹以靑藍各色。大致與考試院相同。惟考試院係就武廟改造。尙拘於舊觀。不若鐵部之鮮煥生新也。其門前之石獅。已運到陳列。</p>
<p>中山路由海寗門外起。直達總理陵前。長至二十餘里。工程不可謂不浩大。惟以築時倉猝。欲趕於奉安前完工。致有數處鋪用柏油。不甚得法。如海軍部前一叚。</p>
<p>發現破孔多處。京人謔爲路瘡。</p>
<p>京中近盛行清唱生涯。所謂清唱者。係合數歌女成班。就夫子廟一帶茶館中鬻唱。即南人所謂花茶館也。初惟夫子廟有之。近城北吉祥街等處。亦有數家發現。此非京人眞嗜戲。實以無其他較佳之娛樂可代替耳。</p>
<p>舊曆新年中。京中各商市。仍入於一種過年之狀態中。多數商家仍停業五日。以先日曾謠傳警局執法甚嚴。如有換貼門聯。或當街作揖道恭喜者。將各科罰五金。因之各街巷人家。換用春聯者較往日約少十之三四。當街賀年者更不數數覯云。</p>
<h3>翁仲夜哭記</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>翁仲。塋兆間之石偶也。無性靈情感之可言。而今以哭聞。斯亦奇矣。吾吳支硎山之麓。有金粟塢者。居户數十家。藉耕鉏樵採以爲生。敦樸有古風。塍渠之東。有某巨宦墓。制築絶宏偉。顧子孫式㣲。年久乏人掃謁。荆棘蔓生。翁仲倒折。祗留其一。猶兀立斜陽中。如魯靈光焉。一夕。塢氓某甲夜博歸。朔風號竅。寒氣砭骨。某甲瑟縮不可支。行至巨墓之側。忽聞　歘嚘嚶。若啼若嘯。聲出自翁仲。某甲爲之悚然。抵家。病數日。於是遐邇相傳。謂翁仲作怪。夜哭祟人。有焚香叩拜以求免禍者。有議毀翁仲以絶邪魅者。見歧言紛。莫之能决。卒由素負膽魄之某乙率衆往搗之。但翁仲旣仆草萊。而夜哭如故。某乙乘月色皎朗。以究察其異。始知所謂夜哭者。乃鵂鶹嘍唳於墓樹耳。摧其巢而鵂鶹去。哭聲從此絶。此事與清光緖間嘉定某古廟廟神動活事相類。廟久無香火。屋垂圯敗。某學徒因被師讉。夜負氣出。投宿古廟中。顧反側不能成寐。忽聞踤𨄊作聲。月光依稀中。見龕神袍袖。無風而動。驚怖奔走。喘汗失色。人詢得其詳。遂喧傳廟神之靈異。大加髹飾。及更易神袍。則羣鼠紛竄。蓋鼠輩穴處袍袖爲安樂窩。此踤𨄊聲與無風而動之所從致也。古人有言曰。妖由人興。觀此益信。</p>
<h3>春宴拾雋</h3>
<p>— 佩玖</p>
<p>吳中獅子林出倪高士手堆。幽曲濙洄。具林壑溪澗之奇。向爲吳中勝景。自爲某氏所得。大事增修後。如山林野人。忽披華袞。已失曠逸之趣。識者無不惜之。立春之夕。姚子子芬觴予於其寓廬。子芬嗜書畫。四壁懸近時名人作品。琳瑯滿目。美不勝收。就中有樊少雲氏臨倪高士獅林一角直幅。觀之令人詩思醰醰。發思古之幽情於不自覺。圖左奇峯一。厥狀似蹲獅昂首長嘯。堆堔處不見痕迹。稍右修篁數叢。精舍一間。間以雜樹。景象清疎絶俗。疑非人境。按是幅必爲高士實地寫生精心結構之作。而少雲氏用筆又能謹愼將事。故足以似之。今者獅林面目全非。則斯圖雖非全豹。亦可作漢官儀觀也。聞少雲此幅曾陳列於某屆冷紅展覽會。嗜之者甚衆。而卒爲子芬所得。則洵可爲子芬慶。顧予又聞當時少雲氏尙有一幅。亦係臨獅林一角者。且可與是幅相并。而子芬未曾得之。則吾又不禁爲子芬惜矣。</p>
<p>越夕飮於吳子迪剛之居。識少雲氏於座。席間拇戰飛觴。佐以崑曲。極一時朋簪之樂。少雲酒酣興到。揮毫作竹石直幅。仿趙吳興頗肖。畫成。迪剛倩尤子玄父題詩。以誌鴻爪。玄父即席成一絶云。怪石嶙峋勢欲飛。修篁掩映相依依。自知難合時人眼。且買靑山種蕨肥。玄父曩曾爲稗官家言。蜚聲說界中有年。今讀其詩。似有滿肚皮不合時宜之槪。酒將闌。玄父出程少川氏紅樹靑山好放船圖見示。用筆規橅唐子畏。聞係餞玄父浙台家子之行者。少川爲少雲氏入室弟子。其人耿介絶俗。浮沈姑蘇臺下。頗不得志。今讀其畫。工力已臻爐靑。定可出藍。詩必窮而後工。豈畫亦必窮而後然耶。</p>
<h3>食水丐</h3>
<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>一月以來。江北天氣奇寒。吾人於榻上睡眠時。與躺在北平三海公園之溜冰塲上無異。有時執筆撰稿。筆冷如鐵。大有弔月秋蟲。抱樹無温之槪。某日不侫偶至邑之南公園啜茗。途間見一丐。手携竹筐一。筐中滿貯冰塊。丐旋取旋食。嚼之有聲。未半小時。食之已盡。沿途向人乞錢。態度從容。毫無瑟縮狀。當時見者異之。某少年問之曰。汝食冰覺冷乎。丐曰。冰入口即碎。嚼之即化。何冷之有。少年曰。吾試給汝冰塊三十斤。汝能食盡。吾以小銀元十枚贈汝。丐聞之滿口承諾。少年遂向溪邊敲取類似厚玻璃片之冰塊多片。並以秤稱足分量。給丐食。丐食之毫無難色。清脆可聽之嚼冰聲。令人聞之咋舌。少年驚異之飶餘。遂以銀元贈之。亭午冰盡。丐乃從容以去。彼時天氣甚寒。吾人圍爐取暖。四圍猶覺寒意侵襲。丐則衣輕如燕。拾水而大嚼。誠異事也。</p>
<h3>常識拾零</h3>
<p>— 湯筆花</p>
<p>乘火車。出三等錢可以坐二等。只要多吃幾客大菜。向僕歐找一個寛暢的坐位。那麽僕歐自會領你到二等裏去。就是遇到查票。僕歐少不得會打招呼的。</p>
<p>踏進旅館。不待茶房開口。先向他要紙筆。把姓名職業寫給他。茶房知道你是老門檻。决不敢多敲小賬。</p>
<p>到點心店裏去吃麵。對堂倌說肉麵叫揀瘦。魚麵叫本色。堂倌不敢怠慢。而且所吃的麵比别人格外來得道地。</p>
<p>坐黄包車不知路徑。切勿講價。到了目的地。只要找一位巡捕。問他從某處來要多少錢。一定不會吃虧。而且黄包車夫决無二言。</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3>Exhortations from the Five Yuan Presidents to Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Central Government's Fundamental Policy is Peaceful Reunification</p>
<p>Hoping that the Nation's Soldiers Will Vigorously Implement Four Key Points</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Presidents of the Five Yuan of the National Government issued a statement to soldiers on the 10th. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Since the completion of the Northern Expedition, the fundamental policy established by the Central Government and what it strives to realize with all its strength is peaceful reunification. Without reunification, there is no way to enrich the nation's strength and elevate the nation to a realm of independence and equality. Without peace, there is no way to restore the vitality of society and provide the people with an opportunity to recuperate and thrive. Therefore, if we want to seek the nation's independence, we must first seek the nation's reunification; if we want to seek the nation's permanent peace, we must also seek it within genuine reunification. The Central Government, mindful of the people's suffering internally and aware of the international situation externally, knows that peaceful reunification is the only way to seek happiness for the Chinese people and independence for the nation. Therefore, it has adopted peaceful reunification as the government's fundamental policy, and all actions are directed towards this goal, and all efforts are based on this. This is a clear fact that is known to all Chinese people. Unfortunately, at the time when the Central Government was striving for peaceful reunification, incidents that undermined peace and disrupted unification occurred repeatedly. Since the rebellion of the Gui Clique warlords last spring, it has been followed by the turmoil of the Northwest Army and the successive betrayals of Tang Shengzhi and Zhang Fakui, which have repeatedly disrupted the unification that had just been completed and repeatedly disturbed the peace that was about to be realized, like a tender sprout that is ravaged by strong winds and heavy rains, and like a dawn that is obscured by dark clouds. This is truly a misfortune for the nation and a cause of deep sorrow for the people. However, although the rebellious warlords emerged one after another, they were all quickly eliminated. This is a fact that proves that no matter how the warlords disrupt peace, peace will eventually be realized; no matter how the warlords undermine unification, unification will eventually be completed. It is also a fact that demonstrates that all those who betray the Central Government in an attempt to disrupt unification and disturb peace will eventually be destroyed. When the Gui Clique warlords rebelled, they possessed the territory and power of the two lakes and two Guangs, which could be said to be substantial. However, the punitive expeditionary army pacified Wuhan without firing a single arrow or a single bullet, and the rebel army collapsed. As a result, the Gui Clique warlords were eliminated. Feng Yuxiang's forces, with more than 100,000 troops from the Northwest, invaded the Central Plains and resisted the Central Government. At that time, their momentum was enormous. However, after a single battle at Dengfeng and Linru, the rebel army was completely routed, and its main force was almost entirely lost. Tang Shengzhi, when the Pukou mutiny occurred, moved his troops to cause chaos and threatened the Central Government. However, he fled alone in less than a month, and his entire force was disarmed. Zhang Fakui, in conjunction with the Gui Clique remnants, attacked Guangdong. After being confronted by the punitive expeditionary army, they fled in disarray and completely disintegrated. Looking at the final fate of the rebellious warlords, one can see that all those who resist the Party and the nation in order to undermine the policy of peaceful reunification will inevitably be destroyed. This valuable lesson should be deeply understood and heeded by all our soldiers. The reason why the rebellious elements are willing to rebel is based on their feudal warlord mentality, that is, they regard their troops as their personal troops and their power as their personal power, and they do not know that all troops are troops of the nation and all military power belongs to the nation. Therefore, due to this one wrong thought, they end up in a situation from which they cannot return. Since they regard their troops as their personal power, on the one hand, they seek to annex the power of other units and expand their own power; on the other hand, they fear that their own power will be eliminated by the power of other units. Therefore, they either sow discord and make others clash with each other, taking advantage of the situation, or they openly and brazenly raise troops to cause chaos. They do not know that this kind of action not only harms the nation and the people, but is also a way to commit suicide. The gradual demise of the rebels is a clear example. Based on past experience, we sincerely hope that all our soldiers, especially those who have occasionally made mistakes, will vigorously implement the following points, and we sincerely hope that they will restore their revolutionary character and history:</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to regard the army as the armed force of the nation, and not as the personal power of an individual. Otherwise, the result will inevitably be to regard armies other than one's own as forces hostile to oneself, and to guard against or resent them. Thus, one either unites with A to guard against B, or unites with C to overthrow D. Alliances are formed and broken, and disputes arise. This not only brings disaster to the nation, but also harms oneself. If the army is regarded as the armed force of the nation, then all armies are one's own friendly forces, and there is no time to do anything but love and help each other. How can they hate and suspect each other? Therefore, revolutionary soldiers should regard the army they lead as the armed force of the nation. This is not only enough to save the nation, but also enough to save oneself.</p>
<p>Second, one must seek one's own survival while ensuring the survival of the nation, and one should not sacrifice the survival of the nation in order to seek one's own escape. If the skin is gone, where will the fur attach? This is an ancient saying and is known to all. If the nation is in a state of disunity for a long time and cannot be reunified, then the entire nation will be eliminated by foreign countries. How can any part of the army survive? Therefore, any soldier must support the Central Government and consolidate unification, so that the foundation of the nation becomes stronger day by day, and then his own survival can be guaranteed. If one sows discord, gloats over misfortune, and makes others clash with each other, seeking temporary survival in the midst of others' conflicts, there is no one who will not perish with the demise of the nation.</p>
<p>Third, one must not harbor the intention of using others, and one must not be used by others. Revolutionary soldiers value character above all else. Using others as tools to seek one's own selfish interests is what scoundrels do, and revolutionary soldiers should not engage in this. Even if others are used by me for a time, they will eventually discover it. When others realize that they are being used by me, their resentment towards me will be greater than that of any enemy. If this cycle of retaliation continues, how can one survive? This is the habitual trick of all reactionaries and the former Northern Warlords. If it is used in today's revolutionary era, no one can escape the fate of destruction. However, the loss to the nation as a result is also immeasurable. Therefore, even for one's own sake, using others as tools is not a good strategy. As for those who willingly allow themselves to be used by others and act as accomplices, their hearts are even more questionable.</p>
<p>Fourth, one should only seek to have a clear conscience and not fear that others will destroy me. In the past, the rebellious warlords, when their rebellious intentions were not yet clear, were always apprehensive and feared that others would eliminate them. The reason why they had this mentality was because their intentions were questionable. If one has a clear conscience, why should one have such doubts? Justice is in the hearts of the people, and righteousness has not yet perished. If I sincerely serve the nation and am loyal to the revolution, then there is nowhere I cannot go. If one wants to eliminate others without a reason, it will not be allowed by justice and will not be tolerated by righteousness. Therefore, we only need to be upright in our hearts and actions, and we do not need to be too suspicious and frightened, like Bo You.</p>
<p>The above four points should be noted by all soldiers, and we especially hope that they will be enlightened and vigorously implement them. To summarize the above, it can be summed up in one sentence, that is, our hearts and actions should be public-minded in everything, and we should not harbor any selfish thoughts. If we are public-minded, enemies can be transformed into friends; if we are selfish, friends will turn into enemies. If we are public-minded, we can gain the love and protection of the people and survive; if we are selfish, we will be punished by the laws of the nation and perish. The distinction between survival and destruction, honor and disgrace, depends entirely on the one thought of being public-minded or selfish. A slight difference can lead to a great error. Learning from the fate of the rebellious who were destroyed, my comrades must be deeply vigilant. The Central Government's attitude also needs to be conveyed to all our soldiers. The Central Government has always adhered to the principle of serving the world with a public heart and has consistently implemented the policy of peaceful reunification. It has neither the slightest intention of using one party to eliminate another, nor will it be used by one party to suppress another. What the Central Government knows and will strive to implement is to suppress internal wars, implement reorganization and disbandment, in order to complete unification and ensure peace. Therefore, the Central Government will, based on the demands of the people, regard those who raise troops to cause chaos and disrupt peace as public enemies of the people and, as a last resort, for the sake of the nation's unification and independence, launch a punitive expedition against them. In the past year, from the punitive expedition against the Gui Clique warlords to the suppression of Tang Shengzhi, it has all been for this purpose. If there are those who thoroughly realize their past mistakes, strictly refrain from internal wars, and work together to strive for peace, then the Central Government will naturally treat them equally and will also seek to preserve their revolutionary history and status. This is what we are appealing for and praying for. War is a dangerous weapon, and battle is a dangerous undertaking. Unification is the foundation of independence,</p>

<h3>Two Cases of Recovering Legal Rights</h3>
<p>Wang Chonghui's Remarks</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui said, (1) Regarding the issue of reorganizing the Provisional Court, because the various countries have not yet given a reply, the date of signing is not yet certain. The other day, the Dawanbao newspaper reported that all cases of violation of police regulations, such as fines of less than 50 yuan, are still handled by the police, which is purely erroneous, because there is no such provision in the agreement, only a sentence stating that, in addition to cases of violation of police regulations, they may be sent to prisons in the interior for execution, because cases of violation of police regulations and prisoners awaiting trial are temporary in nature, and it is difficult to transfer them to the interior, so they are still executed in the West Jail, and the right to handle cases of violation of police regulations is not transferred to the Public Works Bureau. The newspaper's report was completely based on a misunderstanding. Furthermore, the Public Court voluntarily reorganized, its intention is good, but the system of mixed jurisdiction has not been abolished, which cannot satisfy our wishes, and it is hoped that it will take a further step to abolish the system. (2) Regarding the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction, the British Ambassador Bland has negotiated once in Beijing, and now Bland plans to come to Beijing by plane from Shanghai, and tomorrow he will still exchange views on the principles. On the American side, Ambassador Wu is currently in contact in Washington, and according to Wu's telegram, the American attitude is still good. As for other countries such as France, the Netherlands, and Panama, although there is no specific expression, there are no major problems. As for the implementation plan, it will be drafted and announced after all parties have been in contact to a considerable extent. (Special Telegram of the 10th)</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Tariff Negotiations</h3>
<p>The Issue of Reciprocal Loan Products Still Awaiting Further Discussion</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the tariff issue in the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty, Shigemitsu and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Finance Song have negotiated, and their opinions are very close. Recently, Song and others continued to negotiate with Shigemitsu in Shanghai. According to sources in the financial community, our side put forward the following opinions: (1) Absolutely autonomous tariffs, when the new tariff rules are implemented, the Japanese side should give full sympathy; (2) The customs has changed to the gold unit, and Japanese businessmen should comply with the payment, and there must be no resistance to taxes. The Japanese government should be responsible for notifying Japanese businessmen; (3) Japanese imported goods, unless recognized by our side as within the scope of reciprocal goods, should pay taxes according to our tariff rules. It is heard that Shigemitsu has admitted that the above opinions have been fully accepted, but they must be conveyed to the Japanese government for review. As for the issue of reciprocal goods, it requires our side to give a wider scope. The point that both sides are continuing to discuss is the issue of reciprocal goods. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance is related to the Customs Administration in this matter and has ordered the administration to carefully consider drafting the case. It is heard that after both parties have reached an agreement, an agreement will be established first. (Special Telegram of the 10th)</p>

<h3>The Incident at the Dalian Exchange in Japan</h3>
<p>(Muo)</p>
<p>Today's Japanese telegram published the suspicion case of the Dalian Commodity Exchange. This incident is the so-called incident of the great turmoil in the Manchurian financial community caused by the strategizing of political counselors of the Japanese. It is also the first major incident after the discovery of the Five Great Bribery Cases. The Kuantung Government initially prohibited the publication of this incident in the Japanese newspapers. Now it is lifted. The reporter believes that it has a great relationship with the people of our whole country. Therefore, he will discuss its cause and effect.</p>
<p>According to what the Japanese telegram announced, the chairman of the Dalian Stock and Commodity Exchange, Harada Koichi, since taking office, due to the economic downturn and business failure, the shareholders initiated a motion to order the chairman and directors to resign. The government inspected the accounts and found that the reason was that during the term of office, the company's stocks were used without permission. According to the company's investigation, almost all of the stocks owned by the exchange were used up, and the funds were invested in the markets of Tokyo, Osaka, and Dalian. Although Harada and others strongly defended that they did not handle them without permission for personal desires, the general public has raised questions about the use of the funds. Now Harada and other relevant persons have been imprisoned and will be prosecuted for the crime of using company funds without permission.</p>
<p>What the Japanese telegram announced is roughly as described above. Among them, the most important question is what is the use of the funds? It has not been announced yet. However, we knew a few days ago that the use of the funds was to sell drugs to harm our Chinese people. The evidence for this can be seen in the World News Agency's news report, which has been reported, stating that the Dalian Procuratorate searched the residences of the directors of the exchange and other people for this case and obtained various kinds of criminal evidence. These people all used the names of drug merchants to secretly sell drugs as a profession. In the past few years, the morphine, opium, and heroin smuggled into the country reached more than 4.6 million Japanese yen. In 1928, these people and a certain minister of the Tanaka Cabinet and senior officials of the Kuantung Government secretly smuggled morphine and other drugs, amounting to about 1.38 million Japanese yen. According to the confession of the criminals, heroin and other drugs were imported from a certain country four times last year and distributed benefits with senior officials of the Kuantung Government. The incident was discovered because the participants did not distribute the benefits evenly. The truth is like this. In recent years, the Japanese have been selling drugs, and Dalian has been the general headquarters, from which they are distributed to various places such as Tianjin, Shenyang, Shijiazhuang, and Jilin. What is the harm to our Chinese people? I believe that if the Japanese government sincerely wants to express justice to the world, correct the feelings of the Chinese people, and purify the current political circles, it should not cover up this incident and thoroughly reorganize it. It should not be regarded as an internal political struggle issue and only prosecute it for the crime of embezzlement of shares. How should our Chinese people pay attention to this issue in order to prevent drug disaster in the future?</p>

<h3>Method for Clearing Bandits Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the internal request, the Executive Yuan explicitly ordered the provinces to clear up all bandits in various places within the nineteenth year. First, the chairmen of each provincial government must set a time limit for clearing up bandits and report it to the Central Government for filing. Within this time limit, if the army stationed in the province responsible for suppressing bandits fails to do so effectively, the chairmen of the provincial governments must truthfully impeach them. If the army stationed in the province does not listen to the command of the provincial government and obstructs the suppression of bandits, the chairmen of the provincial governments must truthfully report it. If officials at all levels fail to prevent or suppress bandits, and even tolerate bandits harming the people and driving the people into bandits, the chairmen of the provincial governments must severely punish them. After the self-determined time limit, if the bandits have not been cleared up, the chairmen of the provincial governments should automatically await punishment, and the directors of the civil affairs departments will be jointly responsible. If there are famous roving bandits disturbing several provinces, the Central Government should direct a certain army to be responsible for suppressing them within a time limit. It has been submitted to the National Government for approval, and the Yuan has ordered the provinces to strictly comply with it on the 10th. (Special Telegram of the 10th)</p>

<h3>Dalian Stock Exchange Case</h3>
<p>One of the So-Called Five Major Suspicious Cases in Japan</p>
<p>Another Scandal from the Tanaka Era Exposed</p>
<p>Dalian, 10th (Domei News Agency) Since 1928, maneuvers by schemers affiliated with the Seiyukai party have triggered a major upheaval in Manchuria's financial circles regarding the so-called issue of privatizing the stock exchange (the plan to convert the government-run Dalian Stock Exchange into a private one and merge it with the Dalian Shares &amp; Commodities Exchange). Just as the matter was about to succeed last July, the Tanaka Cabinet collapsed, causing the plan to fail. At the same time, the scandal of Dalian Shares &amp; Commodities Exchange Director-General Koichi Harada's breach of trust and embezzlement was exposed. On January 25th, Harada was arrested and detained in the Dalian Prison. The Kwantung Government Office ordered newspapers to refrain from publishing on this case since January 22nd. The ban was only lifted this morning at 10 o'clock. Since assuming the position of Director-General in 1927, Koichi Harada had seen the exchange's business performance deteriorate year by year due to the financial depression. The failure of the privatization issue worsened the situation. Some shareholders advocated for the immediate replacement of the Director-General and directors to revitalize the market. Shareholders Tomoharu Kawamura, Shinsuke Kadota, and others discussed the matter in Tokyo and urged Harada to resign immediately. As a result, Harada and the other directors submitted their resignations on December 13th of last year. On December 28th, a temporary shareholder meeting was held, and Tatsuo Sakauchi, a representative of the Minseito party, was newly appointed as Director-General, and Kajiro Mizutani, the former director of the Kamiso Spinning Company, was appointed as manager. However, when Sakauchi, Mizutani, and others came to Dalian on January 3rd of this year to take over affairs, they discovered that Director-General Koichi Harada had embezzled over 800,000 yen worth of the company's stocks during his tenure. After Harada officially resigned, he confessed to a certain related party that he had misappropriated approximately 550,000 yen. However, according to reliable sources, almost all of the Fifth Commodities Exchange's stocks had been exhausted. Although they vehemently argued that they had not intentionally disposed of the funds for private gain, there are many doubts about the use of the funds. The Kwantung Government Office's Colonial Industry Department, the supervisory agency, knew almost nothing about this case beforehand. On January 21st, the head of the Colonial Industry Department, Ogawa, suddenly came to Dalian, examined the company's books, and discovered the clue, becoming alarmed and at a loss for what to do. The next day, a meeting of key figures in the Kwantung Government Office was held. As a result of the discussions, it was decided to prohibit news and communications from publishing this case, fearing that it would have a major impact on Chinese merchants with the Lunar New Year approaching. The police authorities have taken a strong stance on this issue, believing that even with property reparations, the crime of breach of trust and embezzlement cannot be ignored. On the 25th, Harada was arrested, and Mitsuru Tanabe, the representative of the Dalian Commodities Trust Company, and Kozo Sugiura, the accounting chief of the Fifth Commodities Exchange, were also detained as accomplices.

<h3>London Naval Conference Expert Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>British and Japanese Representatives Broadcast Speeches Via Radio</p>
<p>Japan Considering Reply to U.S. Senator</p>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters) The naval conference expert committee met in London yesterday. After discussions concluded, the U.S. representative issued a statement, saying that the expert committee would continue studying the classification table to be submitted to the First Committee. This work is progressing well, and another meeting will be held on Monday morning to discuss the types of warships to be restricted and the special warships such as minesweepers, mine-laying ships, and hospital ships referred by the First Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters) The Japanese chief delegate to the naval conference, Wakatsuki, spoke to the Japanese people via radio today, outlining the difficulties encountered at the naval conference. He said, however, that marvelous inventions, such as wireless telephones that can transmit human voices from London to Tokyo, should inspire us to redouble our efforts to overcome obstacles in the path of world peace. British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden also spoke in Dorchester, using wireless telephones to transmit to the United States and Canada. His catchphrase was that the United Kingdom is currently spending £1,000 of British money per minute on war purposes. Snowden also said that the naval conference is currently proceeding satisfactorily and that the people of the world should strive to make this time the glorious opening of an era of peace.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Reuters) Wakatsuki's speech to the Japanese people, transmitted from Dorchester via wireless telephone, was transmitted to Tokyo today and was quite clear, with only slight static interference.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Reuters) Some quarters believe that the U.S. disarmament proposal was agreed upon by the United Kingdom before being submitted to Japan. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry claims that there was absolutely no tacit agreement between the U.K. and U.S. beforehand. It is credible that U.S. Senator Reed's proposal and Secretary of State Stimson's remarks were unexpected by the British. The U.S. proposal includes reducing battleships so that the U.K. and U.S. navies can be equal to each other in 1931, without having to wait until 1942, and that the U.S. does not base relations on the same ratio for all types of warships. It can be seen that this proposal is not a rigid and unchangeable proposal, but merely a starting point for discussion. Therefore, the Foreign Ministry is still satisfied with this. The release of Stimson's remarks has created an unfortunate impression in some quarters. Therefore, Japan does not want to follow the U.K.'s method of issuing a statement. However, a reply is still required to U.S. Senator Reed's proposal of February 5th, which was given to Wakatsuki. This reply must be carefully considered by key Japanese figures in Tokyo and London, and it will not be submitted to the U.S. representative until several days later, nor will it necessarily be made public.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government and Party Optimistic About Election</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) The election showdown is less than ten days away. The opposition parties are exerting all their efforts to break into the ruling party's lines. The government is extremely optimistic, saying that the difference between the Minseito and Seiyukai parties will be far greater than expected, and that even in the northeastern regions, which have always been considered unfavorable, there is a momentum of smooth progress. The government's policy is to proceed on the main road, without resorting to small tricks that could mislead the overall situation. Supervision of speech will be lenient, and even violations will be interpreted in good faith if there is no malicious intent. Arrests must be avoided. Local officials have also been instructed not to have standing tailing teams follow the supervisors of the ruling party's side, as was done in the previous election, to show leniency.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Dentsu) This general election will reach its climax. Each party has long predicted the following winning rates: The Minseito party expects to win 246 seats, and the Seiyukai party expects to win 194 seats. The Seiyukai party expects to win 222 seats, the Minseito party expects to win 221 seats, and the proletarian parties expect to win 12 or 13 seats. Independent candidates expect to win 15 or 16 seats. Among the above numbers, there were originally 64 independent candidates, but only 15 or 16 are expected to be elected, marking an era of decline for independent candidates. However, from the overall perspective, it is also a sign of the upward trend of political thought.</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Returns Home from Italy</h3>
<p>Rome, 9th (Kokumin) Austrian Prime Minister Schober departed for Vienna today. The Italian government's official newspaper, Tribuna, stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Austrian Prime Minister Schober's speeches reiterated the inherent sincerity and friendship between the two countries, adding another layer of guarantee to Italy's goal of seeking stability in Southern Europe to maintain the Balkan political situation.</p>
<h3>Afghan Conspiracy Exposed</h3>
<p>North-West Frontier Province, 9th (Reuters) The North-West Frontier Province government issued a communique stating that Amin Jan, the half-brother of the deposed Afghan King Amanullah, and Abdul Hakim Khan, the deposed king's commercial commissioner in the North-West Frontier Province, have been arrested for conspiring to start an uprising in the Khurri tribe to disrupt the peace of Afghanistan. The conspiracy originated in the North-West Frontier Province commercial commissioner's office. Abdul Hakim Khan refused to hand over the office to the commissioner appointed by the new Afghan government. Amin Jan and Abdul Hakim Khan have been living together since last October. Amin Jan recently planned to sneak into Afghanistan and establish a headquarters in the Khurri territory.</p>
<h3>Arita to Be Transferred to French Ambassador</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Reuters) According to reliable sources, the Japanese government plans to appoint Arita as the ambassador to France and has obtained France's agreement.</p>
<h3>After Verdict in Counterfeit Russian Currency Case</h3>
<p>Russian Newspapers Express Indignation</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Kokumin) After the verdict in the counterfeit Russian currency case, the prosecutor has notified the court that an appeal will be filed. Of the seven defendants in the case, three were acquitted due to insufficient evidence. The remaining four were found guilty of printing and using the counterfeit currency. However, it is claimed that the actions were entirely patriotic, so they were classified as political prisoners and are also covered by the amnesty. German newspapers hold different views on this due to different political views. German political circles expect Russia to protest, but regardless of the judgment of this case, the German government and the Russian government are different, and the German government has no right to interfere with the court's judgment. Moreover, the various national agencies, such as the police and prosecutors, have made every effort to collect evidence in the case.</p>
<h3>American Expedition Discovers Ancient Skeletons of Asians</h3>
<p>Sufficient for Verification of Human Lineage</p>
<p>Philadelphia, 9th (Associated Press) Dr. Mason, head of the American Department of the University of Pennsylvania Museum, announced today that the expedition team from the college in Barrow, Alaska, has now discovered ancient skeletons, sufficient for verifying human lineage. It is said that the skeletons are the remains of an Asian who crossed the Bering Strait to America in ancient times. A detailed examination of the skeletons reveals that they are from a very distant era. The skeletons are wrapped in deerskin, and because they are frozen, they do not decay. This discovery, combined with the ancient skeletons discovered in Peiping years ago, seems to provide conclusive evidence that Asia is the origin of humanity. According to the opinion of Hopkinson, director of the University of Pennsylvania expedition team, the ancient skeletons in Alaska are of the same race as the ancient Siberian tribes.</p>
<h3>Antarctic Expedition Trapped in Icy Wilderness</h3>
<p>Oslo, 10th (Reuters) Antarctic explorer Rear Admiral Byrd and his crew are now trapped by ice in Little America. His expedition ship, the City of New York, has entered the ice belt and is planning to find a way to reach the Ross Sea to rescue them. According to recent news from Antarctica, the ice around them is expected to melt this month. If so, Byrd's expedition team will be able to turn danger into safety. The previous panic was due to the news that the team was trapped in an icy wilderness, and the severity of their situation was unprecedented in Antarctic history.</p>

<h3>Central and National Government Memorial Weeks</h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters held its 46th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM today (the 10th). Attendees included Central Committee members Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Ye Chucang, Chen Lifu, and Ma Chaojun, as well as staff and guests of the Headquarters, totaling over 700 people. After leading the ceremony, Chairman Sun Ke asked Wu Tiecheng to report on his general inspection of the Northeast. (Detailed speech omitted.) The meeting adjourned after two hours. National Government: The National Government held its weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at 10:00 AM on the same morning. Attendees included Chairman Chiang, President Tan, various ministers, He Yingqin, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhu Peide, Yang Zhaotai, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Jiang Menglin, Zhu Shouguang, Zhang Nanxian, Liu Jiwen, Chen Shaokuan, and He Yaozu, as well as all staff of the National Government. After Chairman Chiang led the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report: 1. Regarding the Sino-Russian negotiations, the government made a concrete decision after a long period of consideration. According to government instructions, the nature of the Khabarovsk Conference was initially to resolve the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway and to discuss the procedures for future formal meetings. However, the record also contained matters such as trade between the two countries, which went beyond the scope. Moreover, the agreement came into effect without being approved or ratified by the governments of the two countries, which is contrary to international practice. The dereliction of duty by our representatives is very obvious. The government has ordered the Administrative Yuan to forward the matter of Zhu Shaoyang, the envoy to Finland, and Cai Yunsheng, the former negotiator in Harbin, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for strict disciplinary action, and to submit it for approval. Zhou Longguang, the director of the department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was dismissed from his post for investigation. Currently, traffic on the Chinese Eastern Railway has been restored, and the new director and deputy director have taken office. People detained by both countries have been released by both sides. For the sake of peace in East Asia and the safety of the lives and property of the people on the border with Russia, the government is unwilling to have any more disputes. As for the final resolution of the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, it is prepared to send representatives to Moscow to attend formal meetings and discuss it in detail with the Russian side. As for other matters, such as trade, if the Russian side believes it is necessary to discuss them, our side will not refuse to send representatives to China. The initial situation and all the details of this Sino-Russian negotiation, as well as where the responsibility lies, can be proven by facts, and the world has its own fair judgment. This has come to an end, and the people are naturally not satisfied, but the various stimuli from the central government and the various sacrifices of the three northeastern provinces are also understood by the people. In short, if we want to obtain an equal position in the international community, we must work hard to strengthen ourselves. The Enforcement Act of the Obligations Section and the Enforcement Act of the Real Rights Section of the Civil Code have been passed and promulgated, and it is also stipulated that May 5th will be the date of enforcement of the Obligations Section and the Real Rights Section. The Sections on Family and Inheritance of the Civil Code are currently being drafted. At this time of promoting the spirit of the rule of law, the gradual completion of various laws is indeed a good phenomenon. However, we must understand that promoting the spirit of the rule of law not only requires the perfection of legislation, but also the independence of the judiciary and the people's understanding of the law are very important. The judiciary must be independent, which is known to all and need not be repeated, but the people's understanding of the law is too lacking in our country. Most people are unclear about the spirit, purpose, and content of the law. Even people in the organs are unclear about the organizational law of their own organs and the laws and regulations closely related to their organs. This situation must be remedied. Recently, the price of silver has fallen again. A report was received the other day stating that foreign banks in Shanghai were importing large amounts of foreign silver coins, melting them into silver, and buying gold coins to manipulate and profit, which is hateful. Measures are being taken to prohibit this. As for this storm, I have said that it is a change in the global silver market and cannot be reversed by the power of our country alone. As for our country taking measures to remedy the various losses it has suffered, such as converting tariffs to a gold standard, unifying the domestic currency system, developing productive industries, and promoting the thrift movement, these are indeed important, but how easy is it to maintain the current price of silver? However, our country uses the most silver, and the ups and downs of the global silver market are closely related to the situation of supply and demand in our country. Even if our country has an opinion or an atmosphere, the silver market will be agitated. We must know that any storm is caused by the brewing of facts, and psychology plays an even greater role. When the storm has not yet completely subsided, do not panic. Let us all study a practical answer. I believe that the fall in the price of silver should be noted not only by our country but also by the whole world. Our country is at the forefront and should take measures to remedy it. The whole world is directly and indirectly affected and should also take measures to remedy it. In a serious situation, even if our country convenes an international conference specifically for this purpose, it is not impossible. Now is a good time for the international exchange rate conference to be held in Geneva. Our country should send representatives to attend. The cessation of silver sales in India and Annam, as well as the restriction of silver production in the United States and Mexico, can be discussed with all parties, and the method of stabilizing the price of silver is especially important to establish. In short, it is not good for the price of silver to be too high or too low. If it can be maintained stably, then the world's finance can be consolidated, and our country's economy can be turned from danger to safety. At this moment, there is one more thing to declare: the currency issue is very complicated. Our country should be fully prepared before sending representatives to the international exchange rate conference, and experts should be consulted in detail beforehand. It is better to have a concrete plan to put forward at that time.</p>
<h3>Chen Jicheng Leads Division Headquarters to Xu</h3>
<p>Fan Xiji Rides in the Same Train Through Xu, Returning to Lu</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The 3rd Division is moving north along the Jinpu Railway to take over defense duties. The 8th Brigade, led by Li Yutang, marched on foot from Xuzhou to the western outskirts of Xuzhou on the 7th.

Currently, part of the 8th Brigade has moved west, and part of the 9th Brigade has been left along the way to defend the south of Xu. (8th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Abuse of Chinese Merchants in Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>▲The Chahar Provincial Government Submits a Report to the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Chahar Automobile Association has submitted a special report to the Automobile Management Office of the Provincial Government regarding the abuse of Chinese merchants by the Kulun government. The report states: "Since 1920, when Mongols colluded with the Russian White Army to capture Kulun, until the spring of 1921, the Mongols could not bear the oppression of the White Army, so they re-allied with the Red Army and drove the White Army out of Mongolia. Since then, it has become a Russian colony. The treatment of Chinese people was initially lenient, but then the conspiracy was revealed. The Far East Bank was created to issue banknotes and order Chinese merchants to be exempt from storing Mongolian currency and not to store foreign currency. If it is found, it will not only be confiscated, but also subject to considerable punishment. Chinese people are also not allowed to sell tea, tobacco, and alcohol. These three items are a major sales channel for Chinese people operating in Mongolia, so Chinese people have resisted more and more. Only alcohol is sold exclusively. As for the goods sent by Chinese merchants, they often pay one to six levels of surcharges. Currently, regardless of what it is, taxes are levied at a rate of 15%, and the taxes often exceed the original price. Chinese people in Kulun also have to pay head tax, passport tax, water tax, business tax, land tax, housing tax, etc., in various names. Furthermore, it is claimed that as many as six businesses in the same industry have been sealed up in the Wucheng area, three in the Eastern Village, and three in the Western Village. Furthermore, according to a guest from Kulun on November 13, a certain business had a turnover of 70,000 silver dollars in the first half of the year and was taxed 160,000. In the second half of the year, the turnover was still 70,000 silver dollars, and it was taxed 320,000. When the business questioned them, they said that if you do not follow this method, you can stop doing business immediately and sell it within a time limit. If the goods are not sold out by the deadline, they will all be confiscated." The Management Office believes that if the Mongol government treats Chinese people harshly, it will not only damage the automobile industry, but also cause great losses to the national tax revenue and the entire Chinese business community. Therefore, it has submitted a special report to the provincial government and forwarded it to the central government, requesting a way to provide relief. The Chahar Provincial Government believes that Outer Mongolia is the center of commerce for Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and the three northeastern provinces, and is closely related to the livelihoods of the people in those provinces. Now that the Mongolian government is being induced and instigated by the Russians, and is abusing Chinese merchants in this way, it is not only the merchants in Mongolia who are directly oppressed and plundered, but also the domestic economy and people's livelihoods will be greatly affected. Therefore, it has submitted a special report to the Executive Yuan for review. After receiving the report, the Executive Yuan has, in addition to forwarding it to the National Government for consideration, also instructed the Ministries of Industry and Commerce and Foreign Affairs to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government Ordered</h3>
<p>▲The Provincial Government Holds a Closing Meeting and Each Department Handles the Handover</p>
<p>▲Before the New Appointees Arrive, They are Still Responsible for Maintaining the Status Quo</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since the Central Army settled Wuhan last year and ordered the reorganization of the Hubei Provincial Government, the appointed members were He Chengjun, Fang Benren, Li Jihong, Xiao Xuan, Huang Changgu, Fang Juehui, He Guoguang, Peng Jieshi, and Xiong Bingkun, a total of nine people. The Department of Civil Affairs was established first, with Fang Juehui acting as the director. The Departments of Finance, Construction, and Education followed. Li Jihong concurrently served as the director of the Department of Finance, Xiao Xuan concurrently served as the director of the Department of Construction, and Huang Changgu, the secretary-general of the provincial government, concurrently served as the director of the Department of Education. Later, Fang Benren returned to Hubei and took office as the director of the Department of Civil Affairs and acting chairman. Then, a Department of Agriculture and Mines was added to place Fang Juehui. At that time, Feng Yuxiang raised troops, and the Central Plains were in turmoil. Chairman He Chengjun was in charge of the Peiping Headquarters and had no time to go south to take office. Acting Chairman Fang Benren was ordered to travel between Liaoning and Shanxi and had no time to rest. Xiao Xuan then acted as the chairman of the provincial government. However, after Fang left Hubei, the members differed in political views, and their opinions were quite deep. The political affairs meetings were suspended for a long time, and all facilities were inevitably suspended. When He returned to Hubei to take office, he was dealing with the war against Tang Shengzhi and went to Henan to supervise the army after a few days in Hubei, without any significant performance. Recently, He returned to Hubei and, in view of the dereliction of duty in Hubei Province, repeatedly telegraphed Chairman Chiang to request resignation and focus on military affairs. After Chairman Chiang earnestly persuaded him to stay, he dismissed the idea of resigning, and the reorganization of the provincial government was decided at the 215th Central Political Conference on the 5th of this month. It was found that in this reorganization of the provincial government, only He Chengjun, Huang Changgu, Peng Jieshi, and Xiong Bingkun were reappointed. The five who were not reappointed were Fang Benren, Fang Juehui, Li Jihong, Xiao Xuan, and He Guoguang. Wu Xingya, Zhang Guanshi, Huang Jianzhong, Fang Dazhi, and Xie Lü were newly appointed. Wu Xingya was also appointed as the director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Zhang Guanshi was also appointed as the director of the Department of Finance, Huang Changgu was reassigned as the director of the Department of Construction, and Huang Jianzhong was also appointed as the director of the Department of Education. The Department of Agriculture and Mines was abolished and merged into the Department of Construction to set up a section to handle it. As for the position of secretary-general, it has not yet been determined.

<h3>Transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway Telegraph Rights Issue</h3>
<p>▲Liaoning Sends Li Deyan to Harbin to Negotiate</p>
<p>▲A Prerequisite is the Return of the Telegraph Rights</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence on the 4th: Regarding the dispute over the Chinese Eastern Railway telegraph rights between China and Russia, since Li Deyan, the deputy director of the Postal and Telegraph Department of the Northeast Transportation Committee, came to Harbin, the idea of ​​both parties resolving the issue through meetings has been getting closer. Li Deyan, through the introduction of Li Shaokang, the Chinese director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, has met twice with Izmailov, the acting Russian director-general, on the 1st and 4th of this month. The results are summarized as the Russian side's opinion, which is quite agreeable to the method of holding meetings and not involving the Sino-Russian Conference, and that the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Northeast Transportation Committee will directly negotiate. However, the difference is still that the telegraph rights must be returned first and then negotiations, which is different from our side's proposal to negotiate first and then discuss rights. The Russian Director-General once said to Li that if the Chinese side returns the telegraph rights, the board of directors will order the Railway Bureau to send someone to discuss. All other sections are easy to say, and the Russian side will definitely give in. This matter is slightly contrary to the intentions of the Transportation Committee, and Li Deyan dare not make the decision, so he telegraphed Liaoning today for instructions. If the reply telegram is permitted, the meeting can be opened in Harbin next week. It is reported that the Transportation Committee recently telegraphed instructions to Li, which probably stipulate the scope of the proposal and can be divided into (A) Resolving the number of character fees for Chinese telegrams transferred through the Chinese Eastern Railway Telegraph Bureau, because there are few telegraph bureaus purely established by China along the Chinese Eastern Railway. In the past, commercial telegrams were collected by the railway newspaper room, and a certain amount of sovereignty fees were paid to the Chinese side per character. The rest was collected by the Chinese Eastern Railway, called transfer fees. If the Chinese Eastern Railway is still allowed to send and receive commercial telegrams, not only the sovereignty fee must be stipulated separately, but also the transfer fee must be reduced. This matter will be handled in accordance with the method of paying fees for the connection between state-owned railways and local newspaper bureaus. (B) Resolving the issue of automatic telephone assets. The original installation fee of the automatic telephone, the current depreciation fee, and the pure profit of the Chinese Eastern Railway's occupation over the years should be calculated separately, reduced, and fairly valued, and the Chinese side will pay the price. (C) Resolving the issues of business fees and line management for long-distance telephones from Harbin, Manchuria, Suifenhe, and through the line to Vladivostok. The Russian side's proposal is roughly the same, but their claims may be different.</p>
<p>In the midst of these telegraph rights negotiations, the Manchurian Telegraph Bureau was suddenly taken over by someone who did not allow Chinese personnel to enter and work. The reason is that when the Russian army retreated, the machines in the Manchurian station's newspaper room were searched and transported away. After the restoration of transportation, the Chinese Eastern Railway Telegraph Department sent Russian personnel with a quick machine to restore telecommunications and installed and used the old machine that had not been looted. In addition to sending train telegrams, it also collected commercial telegrams. This matter clearly violates the telegraph regulations and infringes on Chinese sovereignty. The director of the Chinese Telegraph Bureau then negotiated and planned to send personnel to enter and send and receive commercial telegrams. The Russian personnel actually refused and gathered many Red Party members, intending to fight. The Northeast Transportation Committee received a report from the director and ordered the negotiation to be carried out with the assistance of the military police. Commander Liang Zhongjia believed that his troops had not yet been fully reorganized and that strong enemies were in the territory and not far away. He feared that a rash takeover by force would cause another war. Therefore, he instructed the director to go to Liaoning for detailed instructions and then decide. Today, the director arrived in Harbin and reported to Li Deyan. In addition to forwarding the report to the Transportation Committee, Li instructed the director to wait temporarily in Harbin until the telegraph rights meeting was completed and negotiations were proposed. However, only train telegrams are currently being transmitted between Manchuria and Hailar, and telephone calls are also only connected to Hailar. After the Russian army destroyed the dedicated line for military telephone telegrams, the Chinese Eastern Railway has delayed repairing it. This line was originally stipulated in the Chinese Eastern Railway agreement as a dedicated line for the protection army. Our side also used it to send and receive commercial telegrams. Since it has not been repaired, commercial telegrams can only be sent and received by the Russian side, and military news is temporarily sent by post.</p>
<h3>Heilongjiang Province Restores Border Patrol Posts</h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: The establishment of patrol posts began in the early years of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the intention of establishing them was that the border areas were desolate and vast, and there was no need to establish officials to govern them. Therefore, patrol posts were established in sections, and patrol officers and soldiers were placed to govern them. On the one hand, it was to defend against foreign enemies, fearing that there would be private carriers of boundary markers sneaking across the border to invade. On the other hand, it was to protect the border people, so that the population would be prosperous and prepare for the foundation of establishing counties in the future. Therefore, its system is the prototype of a county. Last year, the Sino-Russian issue occurred, and the Red Army often came to our coast to harass. The border patrol posts suffered greatly. All officers, soldiers, and people were either killed or captured. Those who were fortunate enough to escape all moved to other places. Now that the Sino-Russian incident has been peacefully resolved, Chairman Wan of Heilongjiang Province believes that it is necessary to restore the patrol posts along the Heilongjiang River. He proposed the provincial government meeting to discuss and resolve the rectification measures. The proposal is recorded as follows: "It has been found that the border patrol posts have been scattered since the military uprising. Now that order has been restored, efforts should be made to rectify them to strengthen border defense. However, it has been found that the border patrol posts have been established for a long time and have accumulated deep-seated problems. At the beginning of the establishment, there were general patrol posts and sub-patrol posts, and the unified system was clear and the response was still sensitive. Since each general patrol post was successively changed to a county, the sub-patrol posts still exist. Although they are nominally subject to the supervision of the counties under their jurisdiction, they are actually directly under the Municipal Preparatory Office. The patrol posts are far from the Municipal Preparatory Office, either thousands of miles away or hundreds of miles away. The reach is limited, and it is inevitable that they will be isolated when things happen. Therefore, each patrol post has become increasingly corrupt and is a mere formality. In the aftermath of this devastation, if we want to seek rectification, we should clear up the accumulated malpractices of the past. Now it is planned to restore the patrol posts in order. Each patrol post will have one patrol officer and ten patrol soldiers, directly under the jurisdiction of the county government. All foreign affairs will be handled according to the orders of the county government. In addition, a security squadron will be established in each county, under the command and supervision of the county government. The patrol officers and soldiers of each patrol post will also be directly commanded by the squadron leader. All matters related to peacetime training and management of each squadron and each patrol post, as well as the distribution of firearms, will be subject to the control of the garrison commander in each place."</p>

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Rectification of Police Affairs Measures: County Magistrate Hong Ruisheng, after his previous inspection of various districts, found police affairs to be extremely weak. He specifically discussed with Chief Li Zhibin and decided to rigorously examine the police in each district first. Then, he would dispatch well-trained police from the main bureau to fill the vacancies and appoint several supervisors to conduct inspections in rotation. As for firearms, he ordered the sub-bureaus, along with the district town offices, to purchase at least four to ten quick-firing guns or box cannons within each police station.</p>
<p>South Bridge River Donation Collected by the Bureau: The river donation levied in Nanqiao has always been collected by the Finance Bureau and submitted to the Construction Bureau, which then forwarded it to the Two Rivers Works Bureau for use. However, most of the grain and land tax guarantees were paid together with the regular tax. The collection offices were eager to hand over the regular tax to the Finance Bureau and repeatedly diverted the river donation. Even when personnel were dispatched for inspection, the payments were made in a roundabout way, and the items were not separated, making it impossible to thoroughly investigate. Now, because the Two Rivers Works Bureau urgently needs funds, the Finance and Construction Bureaus have specifically agreed that, starting this month, the uncollected river donations from each map should be paid directly to the River Bureau by the grain and land tax guarantors. The River Bureau will, in addition to reporting the total amount every ten days for record, also dispatch personnel to investigate each household at any time to avoid further delays.</p>

<p>Severe Punishment for Police Team Causing Trouble: On the evening of the 8th, when the Jinxing Society was performing a play in the public auditorium, the audience was crowded. Yang, a teacher from a junior high school, stood on the threshold to watch. Yu Xiaoyuan, the patrol chief of the third squad of the police team, wanted to prevent him from watching, so he forcefully pulled Yang out of the door. Yang questioned him sternly, but Yu was equally rude. Eventually, Captain Gao Baozhen came out to mediate and ordered Patrol Chief Yu to lead the team out. Unexpectedly, after the team returned to the station and卸下 their weapons, they returned to the scene to cause trouble, dragging Yang out of the venue and beating him. Gu Hongjian, the leader of the third squad, saw his subordinates causing trouble and tried to stop them without success. He stepped forward to protect Yang but was also beaten. Fortunately, Captain Gao arrived in time to stop them, and Yang was able to escape. The troublemaking team members also blew their whistles and returned to the team. That night, Captain Gao personally went to the Education Association to comfort Yang for his injuries. After returning to the team, he put the troublemakers under surveillance. The next morning, the same squad leader, Deng Jinglie, went to Yang's house to apologize. Yang, having a good relationship with Gao, agreed not to file a private lawsuit. In the afternoon, Gao punished the troublemakers separately. Squad leader Gu Hongjian was given a major demerit, Patrol Chief Yu Xiaoyuan and two others were dismissed, and two team members were each given 200 strokes of the military stick and dismissed.</p>

According to the organizational law of trade associations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, a place must have more than seven businesses in the same industry to organize a trade association.

<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Implementation of the Dismantling and Sale of the Qingyang Railway: There is an old section of railway from Qingjiang to Yangzhuang, built in the late Qing Dynasty. It was initially under the jurisdiction of the Sulu Company and was originally intended to be built from Qingjiangpu to Xuzhou to connect with the eastern section of Longhai. On the one hand, the history extended from Qingjiang to Guazhoukou or was built along the Fan Gong Dam to Nantong. Unexpectedly, the eastern section of Longhai later used the northern line, and the Guayang Motor Road and the Qingjiang to Gaoyou Motor Road were built one after another, resulting in the railway being useless and its largest income being only for transporting Xiba salt to the canal for shipment, with tickets that could be sold for more than ten li. In addition, in recent years, sea salt has been mostly transported by the Longhai Railway, and river transport has been entered into the river from Shanghai, coupled with the fact that the sleepers and rails have been in disrepair for many years, making the railway even more useless. Therefore, the current director of the Qingyang Railway Bureau, Zhang Maoji, recently sent a telegram to the Qing Bureau, ordering the station houses, roadbed rails, and old existing materials to be sold. On the 5th, the Bureau first sent workers to dismantle the white iron houses at the station, continued to dismantle the carriage houses north of the station, and then dismantled the rails and sleepers, along with the roadbed, one by one for auction. In addition, the Bureau has a lot of materials at Zhangjia Wharf outside Dongxu in this port, which will be sold together.</p>

<p>Truth About the 평 Garden Returning to Public Ownership: Regarding the matter of the 평 Garden in Xitang being taken back for public ownership and converted into Xitang Park, an investigation has found that when the 평 Garden in Xitang was initially created, it was built on public land. Last year, a person named Li Yunqing had a piece of land south of the garden and planned to build a house. He hired workers to build the foundation of the wall. At that time, the 평 Garden side came out to stop him, and the two sides started a dispute. Yuan Yuxin, one of the founders of the 평 Garden, beat and injured Li Yunqing's mother. She then went to the county court to verify the injury and accuse Yuan of assault, and also filed a case for the 평 Garden encroaching on public land. Seeing the trouble, Yuan avoided it, but the 평 Garden side, because the matter became deadlocked, applied to the Xitang District Finance Committee to transfer it to the county government for approval to be returned to public ownership and converted into Xitang Park for public viewing as a buffer to avoid litigation. They also drew detailed maps, measured the boundaries, and circled the land encroached upon by Li Yunqing, as well as the land next to the playground of the Second Elementary School, and submitted them to the county for record. Therefore, the county appointed a committee to manage Xitang Park, including Li Zhenwu and Yu Shenlian, totaling 11 people, and Yuan Yuxin was not added to the commission as a punishment. The Xitang District Finance Committee was ordered to transfer the order for acceptance and handling, and the case was resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>Bandits Kidnap in Hujia埭: In Hujia埭, outside of Nan Zha, Xitang, Jiashan, a Shao籍 farmer named Zhang Mazi, who was well-off, was visited by more than ten bandits last night.

<p>Examining the Xie Le Fang Murder Case: In Xie Le Fang, Xincang District, a carpenter named Wang A Liu, who had been blind in both eyes recently and could not work, cut down a small tree in his house for sale due to financial difficulties, earning 7 yuan and 2 角. Wang A Jin, a member of the clan, found out and argued with A Liu, wanting to divide half of it. A Liu replied that the tree in his house had nothing to do with him. The two sides argued. A Jin, with his violent nature, immediately went home and carried a pole, hitting A Liu's head randomly. Suddenly, blood gushed out, and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. He died from his injuries. The fang役 of the fang reported to the county, and personnel were sent to the countryside to examine the corpse. It was confirmed that he had died from his injuries. They immediately filled out the corpse form, prepared a coffin, and collected the body. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the water and land military police to strictly arrest the murderer.</p>
<p>Eyes Blinded by Quarrel over Gambling: Wu Zhu Ren, a farmer from Qitang Village, is fond of gambling. Recently, he has been setting up a牛場 and profiting quite well.

<h3>Letter from the Fengxian Yicang Management Committee</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Advises Provincial Governments to Effectively Protect Education Funding</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education received a report from the Education Bureau of Shaxian County, Fujian Province, stating that the county's established educational donations were stopped by the Finance Department's unilateral request, which had a significant impact on education. It requested that the Fujian Provincial Government handle local educational funds jointly with the Finance and Education Departments (whenever local educational funds need to be abolished or new funds should not be drawn, the Education Department should be consulted to ensure that local educational funds are not easily shaken) and effectively protect the Ministry of Education's maintenance of education funding, which concerns the whole country. In addition to approving and consulting the Fujian Provincial Government to effectively protect it, it recently consulted the provincial governments of each province, stating that the Education Bureau Chief of Shaxian County, Fujian Province, requested that the Fujian Provincial Government be consulted to jointly handle local educational funds and effectively protect them. The Ministry found that local education urgently needed to be developed, so it should broaden funding and increase protection. The Bureau Chief's request concerned the whole country. In addition to replying and consulting separately, one copy of the original report was enclosed, hoping that it would be noted and followed to emphasize education.</p>

<h3>Instructions from the County Education Bureau Regarding the Use of Temporary Funds by Various Organizations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai County Education Bureau issued instructions to all education committee members, schools, societies, and organizations, stating that it is imperative to comply with the following matter. It has been repeatedly ordered that procedures for educational organizations within this county to access temporary funds require prior submission and approval before disbursement. However, instances have been reported of unauthorized transfers and disbursements without prior approval, as well as overspending and exceeding budget limits, which is disrespectful of the budgeting process. As the new semester begins, five articles are re-issued regarding the procedures for accessing temporary funds. Henceforth, should any school, society, or organization require temporary funds, they must strictly adhere to the specified procedures. Failure to comply with these procedures or meet the requirements will result in the Bureau's refusal to authorize reimbursement, regardless of whether the funds have already been spent. This order is issued for compliance and notification.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Zhongda Business School</h3>

Due to his demanding workload, he has repeatedly submitted his resignation to the university president, in order to focus on his duties. However, it was not approved until recently, when he was appointed as a senior advisor to the Zhejiang Provincial Government and felt that his responsibilities were too heavy to handle and that his duties would prevent him from travelling easily. Also, the completion of the school building project allowed him to lay down the responsibilities of his role and so a formal and stern resignation was submitted a few days prior and yesterday, the university president approved his resignation as Dean of the Business School and ordered all departments to expedite the handover process. It is said that the successor has already been appointed by the university president and will soon take office.</p>

<h3>Women's Open Basketball Game: Women's Western Youth Wins Over Qiangnan</h3>
<p>▲Score: 24 to 15</p>
<p>The Qiangnan and Women's Western Youth basketball teams, both superior in the Shanghai Women's Open Basketball League, faced off at the Seafarers' Youth Association yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM. A large crowd gathered for the event. The Women's Western Youth team won with a score of 24 to 15. In the first half, they led 13 to 4. The referee was Wu Bangwei.</p>
<p>Western Youth Takes the Lead: As the whistle blew, the intense battle began, with both sides firing shots but initially failing to score. After some back and forth, Qiangnan rallied and advanced aggressively. Cheers erupted as center Guo Xiaoping, with the help of her teammates, scored two points for Qiangnan. However, this joy was followed by disappointment as the accurate shots of the Women's Western Youth forwards quickly turned the tide. The Women's Western Youth forwards spent most of the first half maneuvering within Qiangnan's territory, relentlessly attacking. Qiangnan's guards defended strongly, but they focused too much on watching the players and not enough on the ball's trajectory, resulting in several fouls and lost points. The Women's Western Youth led 13 to 4 at halftime.</p>
<p>Qiangnan Shows Strength in the Second Half: As the second half began, Qiangnan had a successful start. Pei Geta of the Women's Western Youth team won the initial ball. After that, the Qiangnan players were very active, both scoring points and blocking opponents' movements. Qiangnan scored eight points in the third quarter, while Women's Western Youth only scored three. The score was still led by the Western Youth team at sixteen to twelve. At the start of the fourth quarter, it appeared that Qiangnan could muster their last bit of courage and reverse the defeat. However, their morale faltered, and they suffered a major setback. Although they rallied somewhat later, it was a spent force. As a result, the Women's Western Youth won with a score of 24 to 15. Their chances of winning the championship have now improved.</p>
<p>Women's Western Youth Team: Qiangnan Team</p>

<h3>The Municipal Council Does Not Have the Right to Judge Fines</h3>
<p>▲Ministry of Justice Responds to the Taxpayers' Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai Settlement previously wired the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Judicial Administration requesting the correction of information published in the Da Wan Bao regarding the reorganization of the Shanghai Provisional Court, which stated that the Municipal Council could adjudicate fines under 50 yuan. The Association also sent letters to various groups to unite and fight for this issue. The Association received a reply from the Ministry of Judicial Administration and a reply from the Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Association Consolidation Committee yesterday. The letters are transcribed below: (1) The Ministry of Judicial Administration wired, "The Shanghai Settlement Chinese Taxpayers' Association: Your wire received. We have investigated the information in that newspaper and found it to be untrue. Please do not worry. Jia, Ministry of Judicial Administration." (2) The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchant Association Consolidation Committee replied, "In response to your letter of the 8th of this month, regarding the Da Wan Bao's report that the new Provisional Court Reorganization Agreement would allow the Municipal Council police to adjudicate police cases violating Municipal Council regulations with fines under 50 yuan, which would undermine judicial independence and expand police powers, we have sent a telegram requesting rectification. The matter concerns China's legal rights and is not a minor issue. Our association has also requested the Judicial Yuan and the Ministry of Justice to promptly correct the situation. We are responding accordingly, please note."</p>

<h3>Yang Shuzhuang Returned to Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>▲Return to Fujian Undecided</p>
<p>Minister of the Navy and concurrently Chairman of Fujian Province Yang Shuzhuang has completed his official duties in Beijing and returned to Shanghai by train yesterday morning.

<h3>Norwegian and Polish Representatives Travel to Beijing Together</h3>

<h3>Discussion on the Rising Gold Price to Continue Tomorrow</h3>
<p>▲Minister Kong Will Attend the Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce convened a meeting of representatives from various agencies and organizations last month to discuss the rising gold price. A month has passed, but the price of gold has not fallen. In order to regulate the financial situation, the office has scheduled a second joint meeting of various agencies and organizations for 3:00 PM tomorrow (the 12th) at the office. It is rumored that Minister Kong may attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Another Difficulty in Raw Silk Inspection</h3>
<p>▲Jili Silk Is Not Suitable for Oven Inspection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will implement public weight inspection of exported raw silk (i.e., extracting silk samples for oven inspection) starting on March 1. Silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have encountered many obstacles in implementing this system and convened a joint meeting, publicly electing Huang Jinchen, Shen Huachen, and five other representatives to meet with Minister Kong and Director Zou to explain the difficult circumstances and request assistance. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that local Jili silk merchants believe that the public weight inspection of exported raw silk implemented by the Inspection Office includes Jili silk and local silk. Jili silk is known for its color, but its color will change after oven inspection, and the silk threads will become brittle. Modern overseas silk weaving factories use the latest high-speed weaving machines. If the silk threads are brittle and easily break, the machines will have to stop frequently to rejoin them, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Jili silk will inevitably be rejected, affecting sales to Europe. Therefore, representatives have been elected to join the silk factory representatives' delegation to meet with the heads of the Ministry and Bureau to request consideration of the merchants' difficulties in order to maintain the industry.</p>
<h3>French Concession Promotes Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>▲Foreign Ministry Office Sends Letter to French Consul-General to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry Office in Shanghai sent a letter to the French Consul-General, Mr. Ganggelin, yesterday, stating, "Regarding the promulgation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' 10th directive, we received a letter from the Ministry of Finance stating that the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau reported that since the stamp tax in the Shanghai Settlement was agreed upon and implemented, several months have passed, and the French Concession should follow the same procedures. On November 16th of last year, the Foreign Ministry was requested to instruct the Special Commissioner to negotiate with the French Consul, but no reply has been received, and the Jiangsu Special Commissioner has since been abolished, resulting in the suspension of negotiations. Please consult the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue negotiations with the French diplomatic authorities to implement the same procedures as the Public Concession. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs hereby requests you to investigate the previous case, continue negotiations with the French Consul in Shanghai, and report the negotiation situation as necessary. The letter of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs states that the case of establishing a bureau in the settlement to promote the stamp tax has been agreed upon with the leading Consul, and procedures have been established for implementation. The commissioner of the Foreign Affairs Office has informed your Excellency of this situation on December 20th of last year and requested your approval and notification to the police force. No reply has been received, and the Foreign Affairs Office has been ordered to abolish. Now, following the Ministry's order, we are continuing negotiations, and we are sending this letter to Your Excellency to request your approval to implement the same procedures as the Public Concession and to inform the Chief Inspector to instruct all police stations to promote the sale of stamps in the French Concession in order to increase tax revenue. We hope to receive your reply as soon as possible so that we can report to the Ministry."</p>
<h3>The Old Baoshan City in Gaoqiao District is Not Military Property</h3>
<p>▲ Request from the Land Bureau</p>
<p>▲ Explanation from the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Zhu Yan, Director of the Special Municipality Land Bureau, previously inquired with investigators from the Ministry of Military Affairs regarding whether the old Baoshan City camp area in Gaoqiao District should be considered military property, and submitted a request to the Mayor for review. The submission concerned whether the old Baoshan City in Gaoqiao District should be considered military property, and requested instructions. The case of the old Bao City being incorporated into the city's ownership was previously submitted, stating that the city had historically been a military camp. An order was received from your office to thoroughly investigate and report back for verification. Following these instructions, we consulted the Baoshan County Gazetteer from the eighth year of the Guangxu reign, which, in the section on establishment, states that in the second year of the Yongzheng reign, Governor-General Cha Bina and Governor Zhang Kai requested to divide the eastern territory of Jiading to create Baoshan County. It also notes that in the thirteenth year of the Yongle reign, Count of Pingjiang, Chen Xuan, requested to build a soil mound in Qingpu as Baoshan Garrison. After the county was established, the Wusong Garrison became the county seat, and Baoshan was adopted as the county name. The section on city governance mentions the city of the Baoshan Garrison east of the river, and also states that in the thirty-third year of the Kangxi reign, Li Jixun, Deputy Prefect for Maritime Defense of Suzhou Prefecture, oversaw the construction of the new city.</p>
<p>Baoshan City should be the new Baoshan Garrison city east of the river. Since it is named a garrison city and was supervised by the Deputy Prefect for Maritime Defense, it should belong to the Maritime Defense Garrison and be a military camp. The descendants of the garrison soldiers inherited it through generations, which should be the reason for their occupation.</p>
<p>However, the time of their occupation, whether reporting procedures had been completed before, and whether there had been any land contracts or sales afterward, are all undocumented. Instructions have already been issued to the municipal committee members of the Gaoqiao District to investigate in detail. Now, we have received your office's instruction No. 2355, which briefly states: "Approved the Ministry of Military Affairs' consultation to investigate undisposed military properties and requested to instruct all subordinates to assist accordingly." Therefore, a copy of the investigation district list is attached to order compliance and assistance, and special attention should be paid to the distinction between municipal and military properties during assistance. Following these instructions, this bureau should comply. However, regarding whether this bureau should regard the old Baoshan City as military property, except for the City God Temple, and inform the investigators from the Ministry of Military Affairs, this document is specially prepared and submitted for review. We request your instructions. After receiving the submission, the Mayor immediately instructed the bureau: "Noted. This case has been thoroughly investigated by this government based on past facts and history. The old Baoshan City has been detached from military affairs for over two hundred years and can no longer be regarded as a military camp. Moreover, the nature of a city with a history belongs to the military. Therefore, the land within the city is mostly tax-free, as is the current Baoshan County city, which was completely tax-free before the land survey. This is clear proof that the land was originally military-owned, and the occupants only paid taxes after the land survey and did not receive any compensation. Article 770 of the General Provisions of the Civil Code Property Law promulgated by the central government on January 30, Year 18, states that a person who has peacefully and continuously possessed unregistered real estate belonging to others for ten years with the intention of ownership, and whose possession began in good faith and without fault, may request registration as the owner. Therefore, considering the old Baoshan City, the possession has exceeded one hundred years, and the rights of the possessors should be recognized. It should be treated as public land occupied by citizens and should no longer be regarded as military property. When the Ministry of Military Affairs sends personnel to Shanghai for investigation, there is no need to notify them about this old Baoshan City. However, whether this city can refer to the example of the Baoshan city moat land and charge a fee as appropriate should be reviewed and reported by the bureau first, and then a decision will be made and instructions will be issued for implementation."</p>
<h3>The Land Bureau Urges Payment of Winter Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau issued a public notice on the eighth of this month, stating: "Notice regarding the conversion of grain tax fields in various districts of this Special Municipality. As stipulated by the Jiangsu Provincial Government, all grain taxes will be increased from the seventeenth year onward. Upon receiving the order from the Municipal Government, this bureau issued a public notice on March 11, Year 18, to start collecting the tax. The deadline has long passed, and the winter grain tax for the eighteenth year has already begun. However, the number of households paying the increased tax for the seventeenth year is still very low. Grain tax is a national tax, and the increase in grain tax for the conversion of grain tax fields in this city has been finalized. It cannot be arbitrarily delayed. Therefore, another earnest public notice is issued to all property owners of converted grain tax fields in this Special Municipality. They must pay the increased grain tax amount for the seventeenth year, along with the winter grain tax due this year, as soon as possible at the counter to obtain a receipt for their business. Do not delay any further, lest you be penalized. This notice is issued."</p>

<h3>Coal Industry Cables for Expediting the Cangshi Railway</h3>
<p>The Coal Industry Association sent a cable to Minister Sun, stating: "Respectfully to Sun Jun, Minister of Railways of the Nanjing National Government. Developing national coal is the sole source of China's economic strength. The Cangshi Railway is the vital artery for transporting national coal. If the Cangshi Railway is not built promptly, national coal cannot be developed, and further, China's financial leakage cannot be stopped, and China's economy cannot be saved. The key to success or failure lies in the urgency of the Cangshi Railway's construction. Today, China relies on foreigners for coal, with an estimated leakage of no less than 100 million yuan per year. Recently, due to the high price of gold and the low price of silver, coal merchants have suffered great losses, and transportation factories have also suffered hidden losses. The future of industry is declining daily, and the economic lifeline is suddenly filled with panic. Looking at the environment, we tremble with fear. The Cangshi Railway is truly the essential path to saving China from danger today. If the railway is built, the country will prosper; if it is not built, the country will be in danger. The Premier's instructions are clear to you. Please actively build the Cangshi Railway, complete it within a limited time, to open up resources and revitalize the national economy. We earnestly hope for your prompt adoption and implementation. The Shanghai Special Municipality Coal Industry Merchants Association kowtows, steamed."</p>
<h3>Nanyang Tobacco Factory Closure Completed</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Tobacco Factory in this port announced a temporary closure due to the gold price issue. Workers, suddenly unemployed, sent more than 20 representatives to consult with the company's authorities. After several days of negotiations, the two sides agreed after numerous meetings. Initially, it was agreed that each person would be given one month's severance pay. Later, the workers' representatives insisted firmly, and the company also raised funds in various ways. Finally, it was agreed that each would be given two months' severance pay, and wages for February 1st and 2nd would be supplemented. In addition, Assistant Manager Xu added a travel allowance of five yuan per person. The workers were generally satisfied. More than 90% of those receiving payments have already done so, and it is expected to be completed within about one or two days. Such a large factory, once swept away by the tide of gold prices, is a tragedy for the future of national industry.</p>

<h3>The Bureau of Social Affairs Distributed Saplings to the Public</h3>
<p>▲ Can be collected during Tree Planting Week</p>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs of the city has opened a garden of more than 100 mu in Pudong, propagating seedlings every year, reaching about 200,000 plants. The number produced this year can already supply a part of the needs of tree planting. Recently, the garden drafted a method for the public to plant trees and submitted it to the Bureau of Social Affairs for presentation to the city government for review and implementation, planning to distribute 10,000 tree seedlings to the public free of charge for free planting. Therefore, all members of the public and groups and institutions in the city may register with the Bureau of Social Affairs the number of seedlings required and the planting location, and collect them during Tree Planting Week for self-cultivation, but must be responsible for protection. Within five months thereafter, the Bureau of Social Affairs will send personnel to the planting site to conduct inspections. If there is any arbitrary abandonment, non-cultivation, or causing wilting, the original cultivator must purchase seedlings for replanting. If it is confirmed that it is not possible to protect it by human force, causing the seedlings to wither, they must still collect them from the Bureau of Social Affairs, or replant them next year. The Bureau of Social Affairs shall, one month before the annual tree planting ceremony, conduct a detailed survey of the annual planting results, prepare statistics, and submit them to the city government for record.</p>

<h3>The Intentions of Accountants and Apprentices Are Truly Unfathomable</h3>
<p>▲ Conspiring to Steal Silver from the Shop Owner</p>
<p>▲ And Then Committing Arson</p>
<p>On the morning of January 30th of this year, the Tongfengxing Foreign Goods Company, located at No. 63 Huolun Mill Street in the French Concession, owned by Xu Zenggui, was set on fire by the accountant Qian Yunfeng in collusion with the apprentice Fu Heqing. They also stole 7,400 yuan in cash. Detective Mao Jinsheng of the French police learned of this and arrested Fu Heqing, who confessed that Qian Yunfeng was hiding in Xiangshan Road, Zhabei. Mao went there and arrested Qian, taking him back to the French police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for investigation. First, Xu Zenggui, the owner of Tongfengxing, reported the arson and theft, stating that the company had lost a total of 11,189 yuan in cash.</p>
<p>After recovering 7,400 yuan, there is still a shortage of 3,789 yuan. He requested an investigation. Fu Heqing confessed that he was 19 years old and had been an apprentice in the plaintiff's shop for two years. Qian Yunfeng joined the shop as an accountant last year and became friends with him. Not long after, Qian used a false account to take 300 yuan. After it was discovered, his relatives mediated. Soon after, he secretly committed fraud, which was discovered by the shop owner and was being investigated. Qian Yunfeng asked him to go out and play, saying that the shop owner was bad and they should find a way to harm him. He told him where the shop owner kept the silver and gave him a key to steal it. The first time, he stole 1,000 yuan, the second time 2,500 yuan, and the third time 3,900 yuan, for a total of 7,400 yuan. He sent the money to his cousin Fu Heming on Baille Road. On the morning of the 30th of last month, he met Qian at the corner of Mill Street, who gave him a bottle of kerosene and told him to pour it on the cotton quilt in the shop and set it on fire to cover up the crime. Unexpectedly, the plot was discovered and he was arrested. He asked for leniency. Qian Yunfeng confessed to instigating the theft of silver and arson. The rest of his testimony was the same as Fu's. Fu Heming testified that Fu Heqing was his cousin. When he brought the large sum of money to deposit it, he said he had won it at the Gold Exchange. He was deceived for a while and believed it was true. Not long after, he took away 5,000 yuan. Later, the merchant saw that his behavior was suspicious and went to the shop to investigate, only to find out that it was stolen. He then returned the remaining money to the shop owner. After reviewing the statements, the Chinese and Western officials sentenced Fu and Qian to five years each in the Western prison as a warning, and sent them to the inland court for trial.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping a Woman and Detaining Her for Two Months</h3>

The girl's father discovered this and reported it to the French police, who ordered Detective Ding Wensheng to arrest Jiang and the girl and bring them back to the French police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for investigation. The plaintiff, Gu Yichun, stated that his daughter had been kidnapped twice. The first time, he did not pursue the matter because it concerned his reputation. Unexpectedly, she was kidnapped again this time, so he reported it to the police for arrest. Jiang Xiaoyuanzi, who has been married for only a short time, dared to kidnap a girl, which is extremely illegal. He requested a severe sentence. Gu Qungan testified that she had known Jiang for two years and that she had voluntarily run away with Jiang to Wuxi and was not kidnapped by him. Jiang Xiaoyuanzi's testimony was the same. Judge Zhu sentenced Jiang Xiaoyuanzi to two months in the Western prison as a warning and ordered Gu's daughter to be taken back by her father for discipline.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Gold Panners at the Foot of Jinping Mountain</h3>
<p>— Old Slave</p>
<p>Recorded in February of the seventh year of the Republic, serving in the Jialing military. The mountains and rivers are beautiful, and the people are elegant. Even amidst the turmoil of war, conversations are refined and romantic. Du Shaoling's "Stone Cabinet Poem" and Wu Daozi's "Jialing River" poem contain books. What else is needed? A guest mentioned the beauty of Jinping Mountain, with double citrus and wine, to listen to the sound of the orioles, and hundreds of trees with mixed flowers, to happily watch the dance of the warblers. This place is quite poetic. Who would have thought that the foot of the mountain would be the dwelling place of gold? Approaching the stream to find a crossing, perhaps returning to Deer Gate. Breaking bamboo to search for sand, this is what is called panning. Thousands of families gather, rotating every fifty days. Although the amount taken is not much, the principle is in order. The Jialing River produces gold, and panning began in the Tang Dynasty. One or two days, without gaining a handful of fullness. Thousands and millions, will there be a distinction between righteousness and profit? When the sun first rises, the bugle sounds loudly. Once gathered, there is a natural order. Then they raise their bamboo tools. Gains and losses are not allowed to be disputed. Watching the time of casting the net, all forces rise together. Carrying and going away, hammering and forging are diligent. Sand and stone turn into flying dust, and pure gold comes out. The gains in ten days do not exceed a fraction of a millimeter. Accumulating over time, it reaches millions. As for the blessings bestowed by heaven, people are accustomed to labor. Arriving every ten days, lifting the net will surely yield. Not fearing the cold or heat, why worry about the wind and rain? Passing it on to children and grandchildren, without asking for help from other mountains. This is the wealthy gold panner. There are also those who are not blessed by heaven, and their fate is not as good as others. The former returns fully loaded, while the latter returns despondently. Although the river flow is fixed, meeting is without fate. It is evident that the furnace fire is in vain, and it is mostly related to a poor fate. This is the poor gold panner. Therefore, observing the wealth and poverty of gold panners, wealth and status are in heaven. The ancient saying is clear, and this is even more credible.</p>
<p>Now, the price of gold is soaring, and the value of silver has fallen sharply. To save the country, there must be a plan to increase revenue. Why envy the fish while standing by the pond? It is better to cast a net to gain something real. Why not solidify the prison after a sheep is lost? Moreover, the United States is rich in gold, and Japan's gold has been deregulated. Although our country is a silver-using country, wealth is hidden in the mountains, and it may not produce gold. The gold of Mohe is already produced in huge quantities every year, and the production of the Jinsha River is even more endless. If there is a way to promote it and store it properly, why worry about the preciousness of gold and being taken advantage of by other countries? If you say that digging a well when thirsty will eventually lead to water, and drawing cakes to satisfy hunger will cure the disease in the stomach. I heard that the nugget gold of the three northeastern provinces has been seized and privatized by warlords. I have seen that the more than a thousand households of gold panners in the Jialing River have been robbed and completely taken away by mountain bandits. Therefore, what China is facing today is not the gold of international trade becoming more and more expensive, but the lack of protection by the government in the gold-producing areas within the country. Peach blossoms overflow on the river, but the hall of refusing gold still exists. Why is the gold in the gold pit not mined? (Taohua Pass belongs to Lishui County, Zhejiang) In the midst of the Phoebe zhennan enclosure, does the treasure trove still exist? Why is the gold in the gold mine not taken? (Nanmuwei belongs to Badong County, Hubei) In addition, such as Nanmeng and Beimeng in Yunnan, and Wanshi Ping in Sichuan, and Dongqilusi in Xinjiang, all are gold-producing areas. It is a pity that they are abandoned and not taken. Because of the record of gold panning in the Jialing River, it is attached to the notes. Moreover, international trade requires gold as a standard of parity. How can China, which stands in the world, not change to the gold standard? The Ministry of Finance once had a proposal for a nominal gold standard of thirty-eight taels. Tang Mingshui also had regulations for gold coins. Now, in view of the urgency of the market and the fierceness of the commercial war, the implementation of the gold standard cannot be delayed. The mining and protection of gold mines cannot be delayed. If you believe in my words, you must know more about it to promote its realization.</p>
<h3>New Talk in the Capital</h3>
<p>— Chunhua</p>
<p>The new building of the Ministry of Railways is 50% complete. It is purely in the style of a palace. The roof is painted in various shades of blue. It is roughly the same as the Examination Yuan. However, the Examination Yuan was transformed from the Temple of the Martial God and is still constrained by the old appearance. It is not as fresh and new as the Ministry of Railways. The stone lions in front of the gate have been transported and displayed.</p>
<p>Zhongshan Road starts outside Haining Gate and leads directly to the mausoleum of the Premier, stretching more than twenty li. The project cannot be said to be anything but vast. However, because it was built hastily to complete it before the transfer of the remains, there are several places where asphalt was laid that are not very effective. For example, a section in front of the Ministry of the Navy.</p>
<p>Many potholes have been found. The people of Beijing jokingly call it "road sores".</p>
<p>Recently, the fad of pure singing has become popular in Beijing. The so-called pure singing involves a group of several female singers who sell their songs in tea houses around the Confucius Temple. This is what the Southerners call flower tea houses. It originally only existed in the Confucius Temple. Recently, several houses have been found in Jixiang Street in the north of the city. This is not because Beijing people are truly fond of opera, but because there are no other better forms of entertainment to replace it.</p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, the various commercial markets in Beijing still entered a state of celebrating the New Year. Most businesses still closed for five days. Because it was rumored a few days ago that the police bureau was strictly enforcing the law, such as those who changed the couplets on the door or those who made a bow on the street to say congratulations, would each be fined five gold coins. As a result, there were about three or four tenths fewer households changing Spring Couplets in the streets and alleys than in the past. Those who celebrated the New Year on the street were even less numerous.</p>
<h3>A Record of Weng Zhong Crying at Night</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Weng Zhong is a stone statue in the cemetery. There is no spirituality or emotion to speak of. But now it is heard crying. This is also strange. At the foot of Zhixing Mountain in Wu County, there is Jin Suwu, where dozens of families live, making a living by farming, plowing, gathering firewood, and chopping wood. They are simple and have an ancient atmosphere. To the east of the fields, there is the tomb of a certain great official. The construction is extremely grand. However, the descendants are very few. Over the years, no one has swept or visited it. Brambles and thorns are rampant. Weng Zhong is broken. Only one remains. He still stands in the setting sun, like the Spirit Light of Lu. One night, a certain villager, Jia, returned from gambling at night. The north wind howled. The cold air cut to the bone. Jia shrank uncontrollably. When he came to the side of the tomb, he suddenly heard _ chu xu ying, like crying or whistling. The sound came from Weng Zhong. Jia was shocked. He returned home and fell ill for several days. Therefore, it spread far and wide, saying that Weng Zhong was causing trouble, crying at night to haunt people. Some burned incense and kowtowed to seek to avoid disaster. Some proposed to destroy Weng Zhong to eliminate evil spirits. Different opinions were seen and could not be decided. Finally, a certain Yi, who was known for his courage, led the crowd to destroy it. But Weng Zhong had already fallen to the grass, and the night crying was still the same. Yi took advantage of the bright moonlight to investigate the difference. He finally realized that the so-called night cry was the sound of the owl screeching in the tomb tree. The nest was destroyed, and the owl left. The crying sound stopped from then on. This matter is similar to the incident of the god in a certain ancient temple in Jiading during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. The temple had been without incense for a long time. The roof was about to collapse. A certain student, because he was scolded by his teacher, went out in a huff at night and stayed in the ancient temple. However, he could not sleep, tossing and turning. Suddenly, he heard the sound of moving and moving. In the faint moonlight, he saw the sleeves of the robe of the god in the niche moving without wind. He ran away in fright, panting and sweating. People asked for the details. Therefore, the spirit of the temple god was rumored. It was greatly decorated. When the god's robe was changed, the mice scurried. The mice were nesting in the sleeves of the robe. This sound of moving and moving and moving without wind was caused by this. The ancients said, "Evil arises from people." Seeing this, it is even more credible.</p>
<h3>Random Gleanings from a Spring Banquet</h3>
<p>— Pei Jiu</p>
<p>The Lion Grove in Wuzhong was created by the recluse Ni Yunlin. It is secluded and winding, possessing the wonders of forests, valleys, streams, and gorges. It has long been a scenic spot in Wuzhong. After being acquired by a certain person and undergoing major renovations, it is like a mountain forest wild man suddenly donning splendid robes, losing its original open and unrestrained charm. Discerning people all lament this. On the eve of the Beginning of Spring, Yao Zifen wined me at his residence. Zifen is fond of books and paintings, and his four walls are hung with works by famous contemporary artists, a dazzling array, a feast for the eyes. Among them is a vertical scroll of a corner of the Lion Grove, copied by Fan Shaoyun in the style of Ni Yunlin. Viewing it, one's poetic thoughts well up, unconsciously giving rise to a nostalgic feeling for the past. On the left of the painting is a strange peak, its shape resembling a crouching lion with its head raised and roaring. The piled-up stones show no trace of artificiality. Slightly to the right are several clumps of tall bamboos and a simple cottage, interspersed with various trees. The scenery is pure, sparse, and utterly free from mundane concerns, seeming not to be a place for humans. According to this painting, it must have been a meticulously structured work from a real-life sketch by Ni Yunlin himself. Moreover, Shaoyun's brushwork is also cautious and attentive, so it is sufficient to resemble the original. Now that the face of the Lion Grove is completely changed, this painting, although not a complete portrayal, can serve as a "Han Guan Yi Guan" (a model to learn about old traditions). I heard that this painting by Shaoyun was once exhibited at a certain "Leng Hong Exhibition." Many were fond of it, but it was eventually acquired by Zifen, which is indeed something to congratulate Zifen on. However, I also heard that Shaoyun had another painting at the time, also a copy of a corner of the Lion Grove, and it could have been paired with this one, but Zifen did not acquire it. I cannot help but feel sorry for Zifen.</p>
<p>The next evening, I dined at the residence of Wu Zidi Gang. I met Shaoyun at the gathering. During the meal, we played finger-guessing games and passed around wine cups, accompanied by Kunqu opera, enjoying the pleasure of friends at a gathering. Shaoyun, flushed with wine and in high spirits, wielded his brush and created a vertical scroll of bamboo and rocks, imitating Zhao Mengfu of the Yuan dynasty, quite like him. After the painting was completed, Di Gang asked You Xuanfu to inscribe a poem on it to commemorate this moment. Xuanfu immediately composed a quatrain: "Strange rocks, jagged, threatening to fly, / Tall bamboos, sheltering, leaning close by. / Knowing it's hard to please the eyes of the day, / I'll buy a green mountain, plant ferns, and fatten myself." Xuanfu had previously been a writer of popular fiction and was well-known in the storytelling world for many years. Now, reading his poem, it seems to express a sense of being out of step with the times. As the wine was about to run out, Xuanfu showed us a painting by Cheng Shaochuan, "Red Trees and Green Mountains, Good for a Boat Ride." The brushwork was modeled after Tang Yin. It was said to be a farewell gift for Xuanfu's trip to his family home in Zhejiang. Shaochuan is Shaoyun's indoor disciple. He is upright and unconventional, drifting under the Suzhou Terrace, quite frustrated. Now, reading his painting, his skill has reached perfection. Surely he will surpass his teacher. Poetry must be perfected through hardship. Is it also true that painting must be perfected through hardship?</p>
<h3>The Water-Ice Beggar</h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>For the past month, the weather in Jiangbei has been extraordinarily cold. When we sleep on our beds, it is no different from lying on the ice-skating rink in Beiping's Sanhai Park. Sometimes, when I hold a pen to write, the pen is as cold as iron, much like an autumn insect clinging to a tree, without any warmth. One day, I happened to go to the South Park in the town to sip tea. On the way, I saw a beggar carrying a bamboo basket. The basket was full of ice cubes. The beggar took out the ice and ate it, chewing with a sound. In less than half an hour, he had eaten it all. He went along the road begging for money, his attitude calm and unhurried, without any hesitation. Those who saw it were amazed. A young man asked him, "Do you feel cold eating ice?" The beggar said, "The ice breaks as soon as it enters my mouth, and melts as I chew it. How can it be cold?" The young man said, "I will give you thirty catties of ice. If you can eat it all, I will give you ten small silver dollars." The beggar agreed readily. The young man then knocked off many pieces of ice from the stream, resembling thick sheets of glass, and weighed them to the required amount, giving them to the beggar to eat. The beggar ate it without any difficulty. The crisp and clear sound of chewing ice was astonishing to hear. The young man, amazed and surprised, gave him the silver dollars. By noon, the ice was gone. The beggar then left leisurely. At that time, the weather was very cold. We were warming ourselves around the stove, yet we still felt the cold invading us. The beggar, however, was lightly clothed and ate ice with relish. It is truly an extraordinary thing.</p>
<h3>Snippets of Common Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Tang Binhua</p>
<p>When taking the train, you can sit in second class with a third-class ticket, as long as you order several large dishes and tip the attendant to find a comfortable seat. The attendant will then lead you to second class. Even if the tickets are checked, the attendant will surely give a heads-up.</p>
<p>When entering a hotel, without waiting for the room attendant to speak, first ask him for paper and a pen and write down your name and occupation. The room attendant will know you are an experienced customer and will definitely not overcharge you.</p>
<p>When going to a dim sum shop to eat noodles, tell the waiter that you want lean meat in your meat noodles and the original flavor in your fish noodles. The waiter will not dare to be negligent, and the noodles you eat will be more authentic than others.</p>
<p>When taking a rickshaw and you don't know the way, don't bargain. When you arrive at your destination, just find a policeman and ask him how much it should cost from where you came. You will definitely not be cheated, and the rickshaw driver will not say a word.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (126)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 8: A Delicate Bird Sings Among the Festive Banners, A Good Bird Chooses a Tree When the Golden House is Adorned</p>
<p>Shi Chen said, "Although I'm not from Nanjing, I lived there for a long time. You say you seem to have seen me before, and I also seem to have seen you. Let me ask you, where did you live near Hanxi Gate?" Ruiyun said, "At first, we lived in a place called Shuangshigu (Double Stone Drum). I often asked my mother what Shuangshigu meant. She said there used to be two stone drum steps there, but we couldn't find any stone drums. Later, my father couldn't find work and was very poor, so we borrowed a few small houses behind the Zhang family's garden. We lived there until the Zhang family sold the garden." Shi Chen couldn't help but clap his hands and said, "That's right, that's right! What a coincidence! At that time, Ruiyun was startled by Zuo Shichen and said, "Second Young Master, what are you doing? You scared me!" Shichen hugged her again and said, "Don't be afraid. I really did see you in Nanjing. Isn't the Zhang family you're talking about Zhang Huantong's family?" Ruiyun shook her head and said, "I don't know about that. The owner was still young. We called him Master Zhang. He was very kind. I've been to his wife's room upstairs a few times. She was very affectionate with me. Whenever I went, she would always give me a lot of things and often asked me to go there to play. Now they've sold the house and I don't know where they've gone." Zuo Shichen said, "Let me tell you, that Master Zhang is a friend of mine. He came to Shanghai a couple of years ago. Now some people say he's gone to Hubei. His wife naturally went with him. I remember five or six years ago, I was living in Nanjing, and a friend wanted to see Master Zhang's house, so we went to his back garden. Weren't you living at the back entrance of their garden? The garden was very desolate. There was a little girl, about eight or nine years old, barefoot and disheveled, following us, running around. Now that I think about it, it must have been you!" Ruiyun said, "Nonsense! There are many little girls in Nanjing. How do you know it was me?" Shichen said, "It's definitely you. Who else lived at the back entrance of the Zhang family's garden?" Ruiyun was moved by his words and seemed to have seen Shichen before, but after five or six years, who could remember? She just felt that he looked somewhat familiar. She then said, "There are many sisters in my family. How can you be sure it was me?" Shichen said, "Ah, I remember! That day, Master Zhang even called you Second Miss. Are you the second child in your family?" After hearing him say that, Ruiyun thought, "Could it really be him who saw me? What a coincidence that we met again here?" She then said, "Second Young Master, don't tell anyone that I'm from Nanjing. My mother only allows me to say that I'm from Suzhou, that she gave birth to me and raised me. She says that to all the guests. Otherwise, she will scold me." Shichen said, "Do they often scold you here?" Ruiyun said, "It's okay."</p>

<h3>Gold Market Weakening Daily</h3>
<p>Drafts Shrinking, Market Sentiment Declining: Yesterday, the gold standard continued to fall. It is believed that the sentiment among traders is softening, with selling outweighing buying. However, the market is volatile. The difference was as high as six taels in the morning. Sellers such as Taixing, Yuanxingyong, and Yu Dayongkang were actively selling off. Buyers were only Guangbang Hengxing, Shengda, and Wanxing. As for foreign exchange, both domestic and foreign markets are shrinking. There were some selling offerings in the industry. Later, buyers seemed to be active in the market. Fuchang, Yuanxiang, Yu Da, and Hengxing have all been chasing up to those who are selling off to zero. The price only fluctuated around two taels. From the beginning of the morning, it was still stable. Afterwards, sellers surged, foreign exchange prices rose by one grade. By noon, the trend was declining. A sharp drop of five or six taels fell from above 88 taels to within 83 taels. In the afternoon, it recovered slightly because it was heard that a large batch of silver coins was being shipped to Shanghai from abroad. The silver market in this city has been loosened, and people's hearts have turned to higher prices, estimated to increase by two taels. However, with more sellers, it slightly fell by more than one tael. In short, people's hearts are still in a state of confusion. As for British silver bars and exchange rates, there were no reports due to Monday.</p>
<p>Sharp Drop at Noon: The opening price of the gold standard for March was 486 taels and 8 qian, a slight drop of one tael. Then Guangbang made up for it, rising by two taels, increasing to 88 taels, 7 qian, 8 qian. The British gold for March and April was traded at 11 pence, 9375. Afterwards, the wheat firm issued 11 pence, 875. The British and American gold were traded at 48 yuan and 375 for American gold in April. The Japanese gold bank absorbed 1 tael, 0 fen, 1 li, 3 qian, 75. Although the exchange rate has been increased by 25, American gold increased by 5 jiao, and Japanese gold decreased by 1 fen, 1 qian, 25, but the gold price only dropped by a few qian, at 88 taels to 7 taels and 6 qian. Before long, it increased to 8 taels, 2 qian, 3 qian, because Japanese gold was settled at 1 tael, 0 fen, 1 li, 75. Mitsui bought 1 tael, 0 fen, 1 li, 5625 to 625. Afterwards, it was a slightly smaller amount. There were ups and downs. After 10 o'clock, the drop was very tight. All parties were selling off, and drafts also turned weak, with a tendency to plummet. After 11 o'clock, it had broken through 85 taels. Later, British gold was bought by Anda at 2.0125, and Xingye offered 2.00625. At 11:45, it dropped to 82 taels and 7 qian. It went back up a little, and closed at 83 taels and 6 qian at noon.</p>
<p>Closing Price Down 3 Taels and 3 Qian: The market opened at 84 taels and 4 qian, then returned to 3 taels and 1 qian. Afterwards, because drafts improved, banks traded shillings at 2.00625, and silver companies bought Japanese gold at 1 tael, 0 fen, 1 li, 0625. Moreover, British gold was traded, and Yu Da Fuchang and others were all chasing up. People's hearts rose. After 3 o'clock, it rose to 85 taels and a half. At this time, Japanese gold had to be settled at 1 tael, 0 fen, 1 li, 25. Afterwards, buyers retreated, and the market turned weak. Japanese gold could be settled at 1 tael, 0 fen, 1 li, and sellers such as Linghu sold off. Therefore, after 4 o'clock, it fell to 83 taels and 9 qian. The market closed at 4:30 at 84 taels and a half, a decrease of 3 taels and 3 qian compared to noon.</p>
<p>Closing Price Pressed Down 14 or 15 Taels: The maximum price for the day was 88 taels and 8 qian, and the minimum price was 82 taels and 7 qian, a difference of 6 taels and 1 qian. The quoted price has been changed to 498 taels and 6 qian. Because Japanese gold was listed at a small difference of 1 fen, 1 qian, 25, it was suppressed by a small amount of 11 taels since the morning. At noon, it was suppressed by 15 taels. The registered prices were 85 taels for February and 84 taels for March. The supplementary water (interest) was 85 taels, and the after-market supplementary water was 86 taels.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Improves Slightly Before Returning to Weakness</h3>

<h3>Reasons for the Sharp Decline in Bombay Cotton Prices Last Week</h3>
<p>The price decline last week was partly due to news from the American cotton market and partly due to the decline of yarn factories. Four large factories will soon cease operations, and other factories are reducing working hours. Subsequently, due to short covering, there was a slight rebound. Spot demand is not good, and exporters and manufacturers are only purchasing enough to meet immediate needs. Currently, inventories are accumulating daily. The most important issue is progress in exports. The statistics for the past week are appended below (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week Last Week</p>
<p>Cumulative Receipts since September 1st 1,615 1,791</p>
<p>Weekend Inventory 1,147 1,229</p>
<p>Cumulative Exports since September 1st 873 962</p>
<p>Exports to Europe 317 361</p>
<p>Exports to China 76 76</p>
<p>Exports to Japan 451 496</p>
<p>Exports to Other Regions 29 29</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Market Remains Stagnant and Weak</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, over ten boats arrived from downriver, but sales remained sluggish. There was very little of the North Jiangsu premium japonica rice on the market. Due to flat prices, trading in mid-grade and lower-grade goods was quiet. Thin indica rice continued to arrive and sell poorly, and prices showed a strengthening trend. As sales of Yangdu indica rice were slightly more active, the market stabilized. Shops on the street in other port cities were willing to accept this rice. There was no increase or decrease. The transformation of silver dollars was stagnant, and demand was weak. The market was stagnant and soft.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: About ten boats arrived from downriver. Sales were stagnant and sluggish. The arrival and sales of Changshu japonica rice were both slow, and prices showed a slight weakness. However, the prices of Suzhou and Tongzhou white japonica rice rebounded slightly, but sentiment was poor, and buyers were hesitant to observe. Therefore, although supply was short, there was no intention to actively purchase. There were even fewer inquiries about South Jiangsu thin early rice, and prices fell by a dime. Yangdu indica rice trading on the street remained active, and news that Saigon foreign rice was trending firmer was also a major factor in stabilizing prices. The transformation of silver dollars was stagnant and mediocre, with small fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Continues to Rise by a Dime or So</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw little spot trading, but prices continued to improve. This was because, in addition to the rice released from previous unloading, rice arriving in port over the past few days was purchased by local buyers. Yesterday, merchants from this street and Ningbo and North Jiangsu villages in the interior all made inquiries, and the market price immediately rose by a dime or so. It was estimated that over a thousand bags of No. 1 Saigon were sold at 14.20 to 14.10 yuan, and 700 bags of No. 2 were sold at 13.80 to 13.75 yuan. Upcoming shipments are performing as well as spot goods, and prices have also risen by nearly a dime. It was estimated that 500 bags of Xiaojiao for delivery in seven days were sold at 13.26 yuan, and 3,000 bags for delivery within the month were sold at 13 yuan. Foreign firms were quite willing to sell forward contracts, but importers were very reluctant, so the market trend turned weak. It was estimated that 1,000 bags of No. 2 Saigon for February delivery were sold back at 6 taels, 2 mace, and 1 fen, and 2,000 bags of No. 1 for April delivery were sold at 6 taels, 2 mace, and 3 fen. 400 tons of Min Dang for February delivery were sold at 6 taels, 4 mace, and 5 fen, it was said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Weakens and Then Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices for all months continued to trend downward. The price of Tianjin spot flour was quoted at only 3.71 yuan, which was 4 fen lower than the highest price a few days ago. Initially, seeing that the price of foreign flour had stabilized, local merchants were not very optimistic. Therefore, from the opening to the closing, selling pressure was very strong, causing the market to decline steadily. When the market opened in the afternoon, the prices for all months followed the downward trend of the morning, and the market sentiment was at its lowest since the opening of trading. The lowest price for the current month was 2 taels, 5 mace, and 9 fen, for March it was 2 taels, 5 mace, 8 fen, and 7.5 li, for April it was 2 taels, 5 mace, and 6 fen, for May it was 2 taels, 4 mace, 8 fen, and 7.5 li, for June it was 2 taels, 2 mace, and 7.5 fen, and for July it was 2 taels, 2 mace, 5 fen, and 2.5 li, a drop of 1 to 2 fen from the previous weekend. However, after the second or third round of trading, the market suddenly rebounded, as merchants from Nanjing, Wuxi, Suzhou, and other inland areas were buying both near-term and long-term contracts. As a result, the market turned stable again. Consequently, the price for the current month was up 1 fen from the previous weekend, the price for March was up 1 fen and 2.5 li, the price for April was up 7.5 li, the price for May was down 1 fen and 7.5 li, the price for June was down 7.5 li, and the price for July was down 1 fen and 2.5 li, it was said.</p>
<h3>Interior Merchants Starting to Resell Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>After the opening of both the morning and afternoon sessions of the wheat futures market yesterday, all months showed a sluggish trend. After the price of flour fell the previous week, interior merchants' sentiment turned and those who had previously been reluctant to sell began to consider reselling. Compared to previous years, the price of new wheat was still at a high level. Therefore, selling was active and the market fell. As a result, the price for February was not opened, the price for March was down slightly by 2 fen from the previous week's closing price, April was down by 5 fen, June was down by 2 fen, and July was down by 3 fen. The spot wheat market was quiet due to depleted inventories and slow factory demand. Dongtai wheat was sold for 5 taels, 2 mace, and 7 fen, for over 1,000 bags, it was said.</p>
<h3>Rapeseed Sales to the East Gradually Increase</h3>
<p>▲ Soybean Futures Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the source of rapeseed was not abundant, and the market for sales to Eastern merchants in this port was gradually increasing. Prices were similar to the previous day, with 1,066 bags of Jiujiang goods opening at 5 taels, 3 mace, and 5 fen. The soybean market suddenly turned firm, and the arrival of goods from various sources was scarce. Interior merchants' purchasing interest was strong. The market trend remained tight. Three trucks of Dalian Pingge Yuan soybeans, 1,000 bags of Hankou delayed soybeans, and 580 bags of Zha soybeans, as well as 200 bags of Jiujiang winter soybeans, opened yesterday. All prices were the same as the previous day. There were transactions in both near-term and long-term standard soybean futures, and the market trend was stable. Both buyers and sellers were gradually paying attention, it seems.</p>
<h3>Sundries: White Hyacinth Beans Spring Market Rises 3 Taels</h3>
<p>White hyacinth beans produced in Linghu were sold for 14 to 15 taels last autumn due to poor harvests. Since the beginning of spring, sales to Guangdong have increased again. However, inventories are scarce, and prices have risen sharply. Initial market prices sold for 17 and a half taels. There were scattered sales yesterday, and prices rose again by several qian. Therefore, market prices have already reached 18 taels. It is said that Guangdong buyers are still searching for supplies, and the trend is firm and bullish, with a continuous upward trend.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Textile Market Extremely Stable</h3>
<p>Local Cotton Fabric Market: There has been no major change since the red market. The downward trend in yarn and cotton prices has had no impact. The reason is that holders are unwilling to sell, and people generally expect that actual sales will improve after the Lantern Festival, with a possible upward trend. Yesterday, the fine cloth items Trumpet Child, Colored Ball, Yang Crane, and Blue Double Fish all sold for 6 taels, 6 mace, and 5 fen. Blue Chicken and Fortune God both sold for 6 taels and 3 mace. Fine twill Yang Crane remained at 6 taels, 6 mace, and 5 fen, and Blue Double Fish sold for 6 taels and 4 mace, and 5 fen. Nine-pound cloth Jubao Basin opened at 4 taels and 2 mace, and the rest were all 4 taels and 3 mace. Eleven-pound cloth Renzhong was sold for 4 taels, 8 to 9 mace. The heavy-weight cloth market was particularly sluggish because the Northern merchants had not yet started to act. Customer sales: the Jiujiang merchants purchased 100 pieces of fine cloth, and the interior merchants were also gradually becoming active.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Textiles: The market was also stable. Yesterday, only the Blue Striped Satin of "Eastern Goods" showed a slightly firm trend, with more active sales. Four Scholars opened at 1 qian, 7 fen, and 2.5 li. Mei Lanfang opened at 1 qian and 7 fen, Lovely Beauty opened at 1 qian and 7 fen. Merchants from Hankou, Wuhu, Ningbo, and other places also added over a hundred pieces of Flower Brand. White Ground sold for 4 taels and 2 mace, and Huilong Pavilion Colorful sold for 4 taels and 2 mace, and 5 fen. However, the products of Lun Chang in this port and Shanghai Printing Factory also sold well in the market, with prices all around 4 taels. The fine cloth Shile Bird was in high demand on this street, with an opening price of 7 taels and 6 mace. Since the "Western Goods" rose in price, actual sales remained sluggish. Yesterday, the Changjiang merchants slightly purchased bleached cloth, with Tianxiang Jinjiu Deer at 13 taels and 1 qian, Fair Mother and Child at 10 taels and 2.5 fen, and Deji Jiude at 9 taels and 7 qian. The Fuchou merchants on this street wrote in for more than 30 pieces, it was said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai White Filature Silk Rises Another 10 Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of white filature silk in foreign firms in this port continued to rise. It was found that the inventory of dry cocoons in Shanghai warehouses was increasingly thin, the production of silk was limited, and European and American firms were actively purchasing, resulting in a shortage of supply and demand, and prices rose further. Yesterday, Lianna and others imported 50 packages of high- and mid-grade Shanghai filature silk, and the price rose by another 10 taels. Zhonghe and others imported 20 packages of white dry cocoons, and the price was also stable, it was said.</p>
<h3>Over Two Hundred Pieces of Dry Cocoons Shipped from Wuxi to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Last year, the spring and summer cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces reported poor harvests. Factories reduced their labor and stopped their machines due to insufficient raw materials. Over twenty factories in this port, including Xinchang, are scheduled to continue their machine operations tomorrow (12th) to reel silk, and there is a great need for cocoons. Merchants with spare cocoons are taking the opportunity to ship their stored dry cocoons from the interior to Shanghai for sale. Yesterday, the Shanghai-Wuxi passenger train also transported 240 pieces of Wuxi dry cocoons to Shanghai, which are awaiting sale in the warehouse, it was said.</p>

It has now been built and completed. Yesterday, the scene of the church leader Li Dahua preaching was filmed at the studio. Dahua used various illusions and showed his skills in bringing the dead back to life to bewitch the ignorant. More and more men and women blindly followed. Dahua sat majestically, his concubines standing around him, and the ceremonial guards were lined up, like the majesty of an emperor. Hundreds of believers stood under the stage. As a result, the swordsman Cha Shixiong, in order to find his cousin Zhang Yunlong, pretended to be a believer and joined forces with the two great swordsmen Zhao Yaoniang and Sun Mingfu, as well as the township regiment leader and hundreds of soldiers, to attack the church, sweep away the mechanisms, and engage in a fierce battle with the various believers. The fighting in the play has different variations in each scene and is extremely exciting and outstanding, it was said.</p>
