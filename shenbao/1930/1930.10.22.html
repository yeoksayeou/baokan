<h3>英國帝國會議</h3>
<p>歐洲聯盟與汎英聯盟</p>
<p>帝國會議中三大問題</p>
<p>帝國經濟合作之困難</p>
<p>帝國歷史之重大關頭</p>
<p>巴黎通訊日内瓦之全歐會議甫告一段落而倫敦之英帝國會議又復開幕此中意義足令人深長思蓋現代列强金融工商勢力日益膨大資本鬭爭日益加劇國家疆界已嫌侷小不足供其廻旋故不得不進一步結成國家集團以擴大經濟戰爭之陣綫在合衆國領袖下之汎亞美利加同盟白里安所創導之歐羅巴大聯邦乃至英帝國與其廣佈全世界之屬地之大聯合其背景其動機均可作如是觀</p>
<p>或則謂英帝國會議乃不列顚國家内部之集會不當與歐洲聯邦相提並論實則不然十九世紀之不列顚殖民帝國在今日已成過去一九二六年帝國會議以後英國國號改爲不列顚帝國與海外屬地屬地已與本國對等而不復列入帝國版圖之内就法理而言英屬地（印度除外）對本國已立於平等的地位而非從屬關係就事實而言則屬地内政外交完全獨立自由在國際聯盟中英屬地代表與英本國代表以同等資格列席故所謂不列顚聯邦（ＢｒｉｔｉｓｈＣｏｍｍｏｎｗｅａｌｔｂ）决非單一國家實乃由不列顚帝國（包含聯合土國與北愛爾蘭）印度·加拿大·澳洲·新西蘭·南非聯邦·愛爾蘭等諸獨立國家以平等資格結合而成之國家集團也</p>
<p>由此可知此次帝國會議中各屬地政府與英國政府乃以平等之資格列席其性質與國際會議殊無差别此次會議乃承接一九二六年之帝國會議而來一九二六年之會議僅就英本國與屬地之法律的地位作一解决其餘若經濟外交軍事等問題則均有待於本屆會議之討論故本屆會議職務甚爲繁重恐非一二月不能　事前日（十月一日）會議開始英首相麥唐納被選爲主席結果如何目前尙不能有所記述茲先將帝國會議中最扼要之三大问題即政治問题外交問題經濟問題爲讀者一述之</p>
<p>所謂政治問题即英本國政府與屬地政府間之政治的憲法的關係蓋自一九二六年帝國會議以後在實際上各屬地政府（印度除外）已完全獨立其與母國一綫之聯繫則僅憲法上推戴英王之規定而已但各屬地立法權旣完全獨立則只須各自删除憲法中推戴英王之一條即可與英國完全脫離關係而造成獨立國家南非聯邦與愛爾蘭自由邦已曾有此表示如果成事實則英政府亦無法加以制止若各屬地均起效尤則英本國將盡喪其數百年來苦心經營之海外屬地此爲法律上政治上之重大問題此次會議中或將明確規定本國與屬地政府間之權限關係並明白解决屬地能否自由脫離母國之問题然英屬地政治獨立運動日益膨脹本屆會議中或將提出更激烈之要求亦易使麥唐納内閣更窮於應付其次則爲外交問题即如何决定不列顚聯邦全體之對外政策尤其爲對於裁軍及仲裁問题之態度吾人當猶憶及一九二四年第一屆工黨内閣中麥唐曾納費九牛二虎之力訂結日内瓦協定以裁軍仲裁保安爲維持和平之原則但屬地政府加以反對因此日内瓦協定延擱至今不能批准此舉實大失麥唐納之聲望此次帝國會議重開工黨首相或將重提外交問题疏通屬地掌揆以求意見之一致此則與下月國際聯盟之裁軍預備會之工作頗有關係者也</p>
<p>但此次會議中最重要之議題厥爲經濟問题蓋在十九世紀中英國以海外屬地爲其原料供給地與工業品銷貨市塲故英國工商業可以取之不盡用之不竭今則不然各屬地工業皆有相當之發展甚且有凌駕母國之勢各屬地政府爲保護其本地工業起見皆厲行保護關稅以排斥外貨英本國商貨之輸入屬地與各屬地相互貿易均因保護政策而受重大障碍例如加拿大與新西蘭相互關稅戰爭非常劇烈澳洲則竭力排斥印度加拿大與英本國之産品蓋各屬地政府僅顧其本身利益而不問其他此爲英帝國産業最大之難關近年英國國外貿易跌落經濟恐慌失業增加在世界市塲上已不復能與美國競爭其唯一挽救之法厥爲謀屬地與母國間經濟之合作數月前英國新聞業資本主陸斯美爾與比浮卜羅克二貴爵曾主張聯合不列顚母國與屬地結成一大關稅同盟在帝國内部施行絕對的自由貿易對外則行絕對的保護貿易使英帝國以外之商貨不復能侵入帝國市塲兩氏且脫離保守黨另創一新政黨名爲帝國統一與繁盛黨以期贯澈其主張但保護貿易爲自由黨與工黨所深惡痛疾此種過度的對外保護政策尤足引起别國之猜忌因而擾亂世界和平斷爲現内閣所不取故此次帝國會議中陸比兩氏所辦之數家大新聞紙雖大呼特呼鼓吹帝國的經濟聯合但事實上斷不能爲帝國會議所採用惟謀帝國各部分經濟關稅政策相當之聯絡則爲此次會議中最主要之議題目前政府方面所創導者爲帝國内部的優惠關稅即各屬地對於由英本國及由其他英屬地輸入之商貨與以特别優惠關稅待遇此雖與對外保護政策不同但仍爲一種温和的關稅聯盟此着如成則英本國工業以及英屬地一部分之工業自可蒙極大之利益然在實際上各屬地均重視其本身利益寗願深閉固拒而不復顧及帝國全部之福利其能否低首下心犧牲自已而謀帝國之利益實一大疑問歐陸各國謀經濟之合作關稅之休戰兩年内經多次之嘗試卒因各國利益衝突未得絲毫之結果今英帝國會議同稱謀經濟之合作恐亦未必能此善於彼也</p>
<p>要之以工商及殖民地立國之不列顚在月前正陷入於其歷史上所有之危機英國衰頽之原因要不外乎世界市塲之被剝奪與海外殖民地之煥散目前英帝國内部如猶能團結則尙可支撑危局於一時不然則龐大之不列顚行將一蹶不振成爲西葡之續今年之帝國會議誠爲英國歷史興衰之關頭吾人其勿等閑視之（十月三日化魯）</p>
<h3>英政府宣布巴力斯坦政策</h3>
<p>路透社一十日倫敦電英政府發表一文宣怖其巴力斯坦政策謂欲繼續依照國聯行政會所核准之委託代管條例管理巴力斯坦又謂猶太人領袖欲迫令政</p>
<p>府在關於移民及土地等事之政策上採納主張激烈的猶太人之願望固屬無益而阿剌伯人領袖欲要求一種憲法使英政府不能行使其對於巴力斯坦猶太人與非猶太人雙方之責任亦屬無益英政府將在大體上履行一九二二年邱吉爾所宣佈之政策現擬在巴力斯坦設立立法會而以辦事大員一人官塲派出之議員十人及人民舉定之議員十二人組成之至於現在因給養軍隊保障地方安寗而起之重大支出何時可以减少現難逆言總之英政府請阿刺伯人與猶太人雙方領袖密切合作並請其改變意見免使巴力斯坦陷於危害雙方利益之地位云</p>
<p>路透社二十日倫敦電猶太復國運動世界總會及猶太人代理會會長韋士曼博士現向殖民大臣巴斯斐呈遞辭職書並將召集上述兩會之大會渠對於英政府新發表之政策表示不滿因新政策在實際上將使一九二二年政策大有更變也渠謂此政策否認猶太人在巴力斯坦復國之權利並銷滅其復國希望云</p>

<h3>羅馬美術考察記（二）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>（一）古鬭技場Collosseum這個殘留古蹟不但是世界現存最大建築之一看其並列　門的巧妙希臘各式柱頭的應用並足以代表Tilus帝時代的遺物當時場内可容六千人在歷史上裡面曾行過最殘酷的鬥技并做過虐殺敎士的刑場古羅馬排斥異敎時基督敎徒在場内被猛獸生呑活剝者不知犧牲了多少當時還有一種殘酷的鬥技凡身壯力健之武士皆在此場内竸技勝者聽王指揮王用大拇指向下即殺死敗者之表示若王指向上敗者尙可活命但大半敗者皆賜以死往往有最好朋友而互相殘殺者專制麾王殘暴極矣然此場留於今日確是象徵古羅馬唯一之遺蹟</p>

<p>—不死之城La　ville　eternelle</p>
<p>六月一日西班牙名作展與日本現代畫展</p>
<p>格萊可是十六世紀末期的西班牙畫家他的聲名是於近年才盛傳起來現今歐洲的藝術批評家無論是誰都推他做西班牙畫派的第一巨人或者以之與委拉士貴同尊他是急進的開拓者委拉士貴的畫是過於穩健了所以現代的許多新興藝術的先鋒就專於尊崇着格萊可的畫他是一千五百四十八年生於希臘克利得島一千六百十四年死於西班牙托利多二十五歲到威尼斯就做了蒂湘的門徒不愜去而就汀陶萊朶學受到深刻的感化其後又在羅馬研究米克朗琪羅Michelange柯萊喬Correggic之作他是一個極度的悲劇的畫家神秘的色彩最濃厚之一人他所畫的人體軀幹細長宗敎畫上的神人聖者都具有人間的甘味類皆身長八尺瘦顎尖趾之偉丈夫愛用鳶色靑色完全脫去威尼斯派徇爛的流風一變而爲寒冷嚴肅的調子他那大膽的筆鋒從不拘泥於細部畫面常常充溢着沈鬰與魔氮的興感瘋狂的雄姿靈的表現是毀壞了奇奥托Giotto以來意大利的諸大師而進行的他是潛心研究意大利畫派而能脫出意大利畫派的習套的用他一種出世之感來反對佛羅稜斯畫派秀雅之風但是他那神秘的色調仍是從威尼斯派裏面轉換出來的他深沉的調子表出出神和幻想的脈搏含有東方色彩濃厚的表情之主義因爲他的性格過於獨特了所以絕無後繼者不過他給與近代藝術的生命的力比委拉斯貴與谷耶要大的多塞尙Cezanne的深沉的色階嚴肅的寫實的風格全是得力於他這是很容易着出來的這次我所看得作品之中最歡喜的是下面的幾張</p>
<p>39聖彼得之淚The　Teors　oi　S.　Peter不但是格萊可的傑作更是西班牙畫派中惟一的代表作尤其是在於這一個畫題誰都没有畫得如此發刺嚴烈而顯示着神經的顫動這實在是繪畫史上的特筆</p>

<h3>紐約汽車交通</h3>
<p>— 沛甘</p>
<p>紐約之交通聞名全球據實時間之研究其車馬進行之速度在四十二條街南之南北各街道每小時平均爲十一·三英里在此種情形之下上述之各街道每小時經過之車輛有一萬輛之多街道中車輛所以擁擠者實緣於紐約城所在之島形有以致之其地長十二英里半闊二英里半近尖端之頂闊處則祗一英里有半而已在此狹小之地盤中逐日經過之汽車馬車不知其幾千萬輛也紐約與孟哈坦問之汽車道則有大橋爲之介除若干大橋外又有水道二十餘條每日有數百艘之河港渡船來往載客及運輸車輛至於接通紐約及紐裘賽之荷蘭遂道則又爲兩處交通之終南捷徑也</p>
<p>紐約車輛旣如是之擁擠然其車輛交通之便易誠足驚人警士令一連車輛之進行十分敏捷自巴特萊公園迄福特亨路紅停綠行之車輛指揮燈號自動啓閉到處可見各街道之交通其遲緩及意外之事不常見焉紐約戲院中心點之泰晤士街區車輛進行之困難爲全世界最其地長祇十二連屋闊五連屋而每夜往戲院及其他娛樂塲之人數總在半百萬以上其地某旅館之跳舞廳能容七千五百人麥迪生街區公園於盛大運動比賽時能容二萬五千人之多九十六家主要之娛樂塲所每夜於同一之二十至卅分鐘時間中出納觀客近來爲解决此項困難情形起見凡此區域中每晨七時三刻至九時及晚十時半起無論何處不准停車更於交叉之處制定左轉右轉之規則並限定行人之行路規則自此法實行後交通方面速率及安全上均增加百分之三十云</p>
<p>紐約交通上之最感困難者厥爲直達交通之處置孟哈坦島本身甚狹其平時之來往車輛本已擁擠之至而除此以外又有整千累百之旅行觀光車通行其間焉建築橋樑之一種計劃即爲此而起凡南部西部之人至東北部或繞行者均可取道於是因可免除穿過孟哈坦之麻煩凡汽車駕駛者從此可無經過紐約街道之擁擠及遲緩此種計劃不啻爲旅客之福音也但此種說數僅係一種計劃而已苟欲實行必將目下之情狀完全改革也現在之支路加以擴充以容納外面之車輛目下之平路則予自由來往車輛之特用二層平路闊如行人路專爲路人行走之用大商店之底層作爲接應之用而將地板移至上層新平面另有一建議爲創造一高架大道沿孟哈坦島邊而造自奎司羅波橋起東至五十九街西至七十二條街紐約與擁擠交通宣戰之第一聲爲起自四十條街派克愛文義之高架大道擴伸至大中央車站及穿過新建築之紐約中央新屋</p>
<p>十年以來高　在第五條愛文義之交通銅塔放紅綠燈光以指揮車輛者現亦因時勢之需要而拆毀其地乃得空𨻶之處甚多至於塔上指揮車輛燈光則移設路旁之柱中繼續工作第三步之解决交通困難爲建一二萬一千三百尺之高架大道位置在卡納爾街西七十二條街間之赫特森河西此路一旦告成可以解南北愛文義之直接交通其告成之期當在一九三二年此高架大道上有闊三十尺之路兩條每小時可容五千至九千輛之汽車經過其速率每小時可三十五英里高度離平地約十四尺至十八尺之間此道與各重要馬路接啣處亦可昇降</p>
<h3>如何接受新車</h3>
<p>— 丁祖澤</p>
<p>應注意之事項</p>
<p>汽車廠運出新汽車每將散熱器及汽油箱放乾甚有將油池内之機器油亦除去者接受後須在此三處查看擇其空者補充之</p>
<p>新汽車出廠前廠中人員自將所需各物裝配齊備但沿途舟車運輸難免有遺失或被損壞接受者决不可粗心不加檢點</p>
<p>有時亦有加足汽油·機器油·與水·並各件齊備之新汽車交與購車者購者亦應細心檢點一番蓋每有從售車行家由其雇員駕駛至購者寓所沿途並無困難而購者在接受時苟不知察看則一轉手之頃所購之汽車忽生病害此例亦常有至此後悔不及矣</p>
<p>檢查之手續可按照所購汽車之說明書而行書中載明一切所附送修理工具宜檢查一遍以防缺少此等微小工具車行工人以其易於取携每多私取一二件購者以其所値不多類皆不追究但遇需要時即覺此等微小工具之重要矣新車之外觀應留意有無損傷備胎備輪或備圈有否每一電燈完好否是否能發光簡言之各零星物件决不可缺少尤關重要者爲檢查售車行家所訂售車合同上其所開汽車牌子式樣與引擎號數是否完全與所接受之車輛符合以防受欺</p>
<p>如所接受之新汽車係自木箱内拆出者除應逐件裝合外應留意次之數項</p>
<p>車胎　各個車胎完好無缺並打足空氣即屬備胎亦應打氣後方可掛於車上</p>
<p>水汽油機油　散熱器内灌滿淸水引擎走熱之後略添加少許機器油汽油箱内加足汽油如發見有宿没須預放除之傳動部份檢查變速機後軸壳兩處所存之機器油是否充滿可將該兩處之油塞頭拔除如油面已比油塞頭地位低降則加入機器油少許直至油自該孔𨻶（塞頭處）外溢而止</p>
<h3>齒輪同時相合之傳動法</h3>
<p>— 吉人</p>
<p>一九三一年式頭上汽門式新别克之許多改進中最新式而最爲車主與駕駛人注意者莫如齒輪同時相合之傳動法據克利時氏云（上海通用汽車公司經理）此種傳動法祗美國通用汽車製造總廠所造價最昻貴之汽車有之至其機力流動之順和流利亦祗此八汽缸引擎車有之凡今新别克汽車（除八—五十號外）無不有此特色</p>
<p>别克之齒輪同時相合之傳動法能於任何速力下將頭排推至二排而至三排及同時吃倒排毫無衝突阻碍利益之多不勝枚舉致於運用時之不作軋聲尤增駕駛之愉快</p>
<p>齒輪同時相合之傳動器保障安全之駕駛駛車者均知下高坵斜坡時用第二排較爲穩妥使速力不致過於猛急免除意外禍端往往山坡之高難以猜料非實地下坡不知其斜度故速力高迫時吃排最難非裝有齒輪同時相合之傳動法不足以應付當時之難關</p>
<p>車速無論如何高時裝有齒輪同時相合之傳動器可立刻由未排退回二排無容思索用時駕駛者祗將傳力踏板壓下與齒輪軸桿推至原處車即應用順手且其出發前吃排時完全自動非常安穩對於車制内部機件固有馬達之機力增减速度得以耐久不少</p>
<p>齒輪同時相合之傳動器之動作極其和順在各種路面行駛之時可以控制自如無粗笨震盪之慮即立時由低速加至高</p>

<p>該器之製法精妙用法簡便並非虚假設　尤非暫時秘訣此種機關純爲機械化與科學化無須整理自動節制</p>
<p>齒輪同時相合之傳動法之原理頗爲巧妙略述如下當頭排換至二排而至三排或吃倒排時内有二旋輪同時傳動快慢相等免於衝突普通變速器雖亦有二齒輪然不同時傳動一齒輪之轉動常與馬達轉旋速率相等另一齒輪之轉動常與車行速度相同變速時必須先將車行或引擎速度與加速器或車制相等然後方可吃排不致衝碰由此觀之普通變速器行駛於高坵粗略時欲其及時變速實屬難事</p>
<p>齒輪傳引機力至變速桿係在總軸桿滑面上傳旋齒輪軸桿旋轉時初與尖圓體之傳力盒相觸並與齒形傳力盒與轉動齒輪之牙齒軋緊使自由轉動齒輸與變速桿發生直接關係齒輪同時相合傳動器之中心乃一種簡單之尖圓體傳力盒與旋轉齒輪緊握確準二轉動齒輪之速力該項機械準確非凡當尖圓體之傳力盒將速度對準後齒形傳力盒與轉動齒輪即繼之而起在尖圓體之傳力盒内從事工作至二齒輪完全合并後尖圓體之傳力盒即自動脫離關係</p>
<p>運用齒輪方法並無改變今駕駛者推動齒輪時但覺輕快靈便動作應手並使尖圓體之傳力盒在齒形傳力盒未接觸前完成其校速之工作因此以前粗笨之吃排方法及速力增减之憂慮均可免除矣</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between the Political Situation and the Economy of Various Countries</h3>
<p>The economy of countries with stable political situations is also stable, while the economy of countries with unstable political situations is also unstable. This is true not only for the country itself but can also affect other countries. For example, the victory of extremist parties in the German elections caused French stocks to plummet. When the German government won in parliament, German stocks surged. This is clear evidence. However, looking at it from the opposite perspective, if a country's economy is unstable, its political situation will also be unstable. Some say that the revolutions in various South American countries were not caused by politics but by the economy. The decline in commerce and the difficulty of life led to revolutionary movements by the opposition party. This does not seem to be without reason. Furthermore, the political turmoil in Spain led to the devaluation of the national currency. The government wanted to curb the devaluation, but the financial community feared causing political turmoil and resigned. This interrelated relationship is even more obvious. For example, in Japan, some in the naval community opposed the London Naval Treaty and were unwilling to accept cuts in naval spending, causing the government budget to fail to pass for a time. Now, in view of the overall economic situation, it has agreed to reduce it by 10 million yuan, which shows that the economy can also influence the political situation.</p>
<p>In short, the economy and political situation of any country are closely related. It is impossible to only consider one without considering the other.</p>

<h3>British Imperial Conference</h3>
<p>European Alliance and Pan-British Alliance</p>
<p>Three Major Issues at the Imperial Conference</p>
<p>Difficulties of Imperial Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>A Crucial Moment in Imperial History</p>
<p>Paris Correspondence - The Pan-European Conference in Geneva has just concluded, and the British Imperial Conference in London has commenced again. The significance of this is profound, as the financial, industrial, and commercial power of modern powers is increasing, and the struggle for capital is intensifying. National boundaries are deemed too small to allow for their maneuvering, so they must form national blocs to expand the battle lines of economic warfare. The Pan-American alliance under the leadership of the United States, the Pan-European Federation initiated by Briand, and the grand alliance of the British Empire with its possessions spread around the world all share this background and motivation.</p>
<p>Some argue that the British Imperial Conference is an internal gathering of the British nation and should not be compared with the European Federation. However, the British colonial empire of the 19th century is a thing of the past. After the 1926 Imperial Conference, the name of the British nation was changed to the British Empire and its overseas territories. The territories are now equal to the home country and are no longer included within the empire's boundaries. In legal terms, British territories (excluding India) have an equal rather than subordinate relationship with the home country. In fact, the territories are completely independent and free in domestic and foreign affairs. In the League of Nations, representatives of the British territories sit with the same qualifications as representatives of the British home country. Therefore, the so-called British Commonwealth is not a single country, but rather a national bloc formed by the British Empire (including the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland), India, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, Ireland, and other independent countries on an equal footing.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that the governments of the various territories and the British government are attending this Imperial Conference on an equal footing, and its nature is no different from that of an international conference. This conference is a continuation of the 1926 Imperial Conference. The 1926 conference only resolved the legal status of the British home country and its territories. Other issues, such as economic, diplomatic, and military matters, are all pending discussion at this session. Therefore, the tasks of this session are very heavy and may not be completed in one or two months. Before the conference began (October 1), British Prime Minister MacDonald was elected as chairman. The results are currently unknown, but I will first describe the three most important issues of the Imperial Conference, namely, political issues, diplomatic issues, and economic issues, for the readers.</p>
<p>The so-called political issue is the political and constitutional relationship between the British home government and the territorial governments. Since the 1926 Imperial Conference, the territorial governments (excluding India) have been completely independent. Their only connection with the mother country is the constitutional provision of supporting the British King. However, since the legislative power of each territory is completely independent, it is only necessary to delete the clause of supporting the British King from the constitution to completely break away from the United Kingdom and create an independent country. The Union of South Africa and the Irish Free State have already expressed this intention. If it becomes a reality, the British government will be unable to stop it. If each territory follows suit, the British home country will lose its overseas territories that it has painstakingly managed for centuries. This is a major legal and political issue. This conference may clearly stipulate the scope of authority between the home country and the territorial governments and clearly resolve the issue of whether the territories can freely secede from the mother country. However, the political independence movement in the British territories is growing, and this session may raise even more radical demands, making it even more difficult for the MacDonald cabinet to cope with. The second is the diplomatic issue, namely, how to determine the foreign policy of the entire British Commonwealth, especially its attitude towards disarmament and arbitration issues. We should still remember that in the first Labour cabinet in 1924, MacDonald spent a great deal of effort to conclude the Geneva Agreement, which took disarmament, arbitration, and security as the principles for maintaining peace. However, the territorial governments opposed it, so the Geneva Agreement has been delayed until now and cannot be ratified. This action greatly diminished MacDonald's reputation. At this Imperial Conference, the Labour Prime Minister may re-raise the diplomatic issue and consult with the territorial leaders to seek consensus. This is closely related to the work of the Preparatory Commission for the Disarmament Conference of the League of Nations next month.</p>
<p>However, the most important issue at this conference is the economic issue. In the 19th century, the United Kingdom regarded its overseas territories as its source of raw materials and its market for industrial products. Therefore, British industry and commerce could draw on them inexhaustibly. Today, however, this is no longer the case. The industries of the various territories have developed considerably, and some have even surpassed those of the mother country. In order to protect their local industries, the governments of the various territories have vigorously implemented protectionist tariffs to exclude foreign goods. The import of British goods into the territories and mutual trade between the territories have been greatly hindered by protectionist policies. For example, the tariff war between Canada and New Zealand is very fierce. Australia is doing its utmost to exclude the products of India, Canada, and the British home country. The governments of the various territories only care about their own interests and do not care about others. This is the greatest difficulty for British imperial industry. In recent years, the decline in British foreign trade, the economic panic, and the increase in unemployment have made it unable to compete with the United States in the world market. The only way to save it is to seek economic cooperation between the territories and the mother country. A few months ago, two lords, Luce Miller and Beaverbrook, who were capital owners in the British news industry, advocated uniting the British mother country and its territories to form a large customs union. Absolute free trade would be implemented within the empire, while absolute protectionist trade would be implemented externally, so that goods from outside the British Empire could no longer enter the imperial market. The two also left the Conservative Party and created a new political party called the Imperial Unity and Prosperity Party in order to implement their advocacy. However, the protectionist trade is deeply hated by the Liberal Party and the Labour Party. This excessive external protectionist policy is especially likely to arouse suspicion from other countries, thereby disrupting world peace, and is definitely not adopted by the current cabinet. Therefore, although the several large newspapers run by Luce and Beaverbrook are loudly advocating the economic unification of the empire at this Imperial Conference, it is impossible for the Imperial Conference to adopt it. However, seeking a considerable connection between the economic and tariff policies of the various parts of the empire is the most important issue at this conference. What the government is currently advocating is preferential tariffs within the empire, that is, the various territories will grant special preferential tariff treatment to goods imported from the British home country and other British territories. Although this is different from external protectionist policies, it is still a mild customs union. If this is achieved, British industry and a part of the industry in the British territories will benefit greatly. However, in practice, the various territories value their own interests and would rather close themselves off and not care about the welfare of the entire empire. Whether they can lower their heads, sacrifice themselves, and seek the interests of the empire is a big question. The European countries have sought economic cooperation and a tariff truce, and have made many attempts in the past two years, but have not achieved any results due to conflicts of interest between the countries. Now that the British Imperial Conference is also seeking economic cooperation, I am afraid it will not be better than them.</p>
<p>In short, the United Kingdom, which was founded on industry and commerce and colonies, is facing the greatest crisis in its history a month ago. The reasons for the decline of the United Kingdom are nothing more than the deprivation of the world market and the dissolution of overseas colonies. If the British Empire can still unite internally, it can still support the crisis for a while. Otherwise, the huge British Empire will collapse and become a continuation of Spain and Portugal. This year's Imperial Conference is truly a turning point in the rise and fall of British history, and we must not take it lightly. (Hua Lu, October 3)</p>
<h3>The British Government Announces Palestine Policy</h3>
<p>London, October 10 (Reuters) - The British government issued a document announcing its Palestine policy, stating that it intends to continue to administer Palestine in accordance with the mandate approved by the League of Nations. It also stated that it is futile for Jewish leaders to try to force the government to adopt the demands of radical Jews in its policies on immigration and land. It is also futile for Arab leaders to demand a constitution that would prevent the British government from exercising its responsibilities to both Jews and non-Jews in Palestine. The British government will generally implement the policy announced by Churchill in 1922. It is now planned to establish a legislative council in Palestine, composed of one chief official, ten officials appointed by the government, and twelve members elected by the people. As for when the significant expenditures currently incurred for supplying troops and ensuring local security can be reduced, it is difficult to say. In short, the British government asks the leaders of both the Arabs and the Jews to cooperate closely and to change their views to avoid placing Palestine in a position that endangers the interests of both sides.</p>
<p>London, October 20 (Reuters) - Dr. Weizmann, president of the World Zionist Organization and the Jewish Agency, has now submitted his resignation to Colonial Secretary Passfield and will convene a general meeting of the above two organizations. He expressed dissatisfaction with the British government's newly announced policy because the new policy will, in effect, greatly change the policy of 1922. He said that this policy denies the right of the Jews to restore their country in Palestine and eliminates their hope of restoring their country.</p>
<h3>German Coal Mine Explosion, Hundreds of Miners Buried</h3>
<p>Alsdorf, Germany, October 21 (Reuters) - A fire in explosives stored underground in a German coal mine in Alsdorf today caused an explosion that buried two hundred miners alive in the mine shaft. Twenty-two bodies have now been excavated. The force of the explosion was so great that houses in neighboring villages were destroyed. It is also reported that the people buried in the mine are now able to communicate with the outside world by telephone. They are located 1,500 feet below the surface. It is now believed that there are three to four hundred people in total, most of whom are still alive. Rescue efforts are underway from neighboring mines. So far, fifty dead and injured have been recovered.</p>

<h3>Norwegian Parliament Election, Left Loses Ground</h3>
<p>Oslo, October 21 (National News Agency) - The three-year term of the current Norwegian Parliament has expired, and a general election was held on Sunday. In this election, the forces of the Social Democratic and Communist parties have greatly declined, while the resistance of the anti-socialist faction has gained a great advantage. It will almost occupy more than half of the 150 seats in Parliament. However, the power of the Labour Party is also not weak, and it is not hopeless that most of the votes may even go to that party. This election has attracted great attention from the domestic public and various countries, because the radical faction of the left wing is very active and strives to implement its astonishing doctrine of completely abolishing the poll tax, eliminating armaments, and nationalizing banks.</p>
<h3>Obata Will Be Reassigned as Ambassador to Germany</h3>
<p>The Twenty-One Demands</p>
<p>Are Still Not Forgotten By The Chinese People</p>
<p>Tokyo, October 21 (Reuters) - Obata, who was appointed as the Japanese Ambassador to China last year but was not accepted by the Chinese government, has now been internally designated to be reassigned as the Ambassador to Germany. As soon as the Japanese Emperor returns to Tokyo after reviewing the naval maneuvers, the official appointment will be made. The discord between China and Japan caused by this matter can thus be eliminated. It is said that on Sunday, Chairman Chiang mentioned this matter implicitly when he spoke with Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Nagai in Nanjing, saying that China and Japan must maintain friendly relations. Japanese newspapers all highlighted Chiang's remarks and drew public attention to them. According to various key figures, the Japanese government currently does not want to appoint an ambassador to China in the short term and will have Shigemitsu Aoi serve as the acting ambassador for a long term.</p>
<p>League of Nations</p>
<h3>Discussion of the Drug Trade Completed</h3>
<p>Geneva, October 20 (Reuters) - The Central Opium Board of the League of Nations completed its discussion on the drug trade today and passed a report on the Board's work in 1929 to be submitted to the Administrative Council of the League of Nations in the future. The most noteworthy of these is the motion by US representative Mr. May to amend a clause in the Geneva Opium Convention. If this motion is implemented, the Opium Board will have the right to advocate that not only should the import of various raw materials listed in the Opium Convention be prohibited from a country that violates the Convention, but also the export of such raw materials to that country should be prohibited. The report severely denounced the dangers of the illegal drug trade.</p>

<h3>French and German Securities Rise and Fall Respectively</h3>
<p>Paris, October 20 (Pacific News Agency) - After the repeated stock market crashes on the New York Stock Exchange, followed by the Franco-Italian friendship and the German situation, the Paris Stock Exchange felt a great impact. The downward trend was extremely strong at the end of last week. Even after the fall, the rebound was excessive. The French government believes that the gold reserves are so large that the downward trend could not have occurred without the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants and foreign enemies, so it ordered strict investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Berlin, October 20 (National News Agency) - The government has obtained the support of the majority in the parliament, which has made the people in the stock exchange feel better. The market situation has been good for a long time. This morning, most stock prices rose by 4% to 6%, and even by 14%. At the close, rumors from outside said that the opposition party would still implement strategies to defeat the government, causing the prices to fall again, but many are still higher than the market price.</p>

<h3>The Climate in the Central and Western United States Suddenly Turns Cold, and People Have Frozen to Death on the Roads</h3>
<p>Chicago, October 20 (Associated Press) - The climate in the central and western United States has suddenly changed. After the cold, 20 local residents have been frozen to death because they were not prepared in advance. There are many who are trapped by the severe cold. In addition, during this time of unemployment, there are as many as 50,000 homeless people in the state of Chicago who wander on the roads all day long, shivering and pitiful. These people are forced by hunger, so they pawned their coats in the warm weather a few days ago to buy food, which has led to great distress. In addition to Chicago, where the climate is the coldest, other small cities have also been affected by the cold wave. Currently, Red Cross personnel are cooperating with the government to prepare for the relief of unemployed people. It is reported that many poor people are deliberately violating police regulations in order to go to jail to avoid the cold.</p>

Wang Zhengting chaired the meeting. The following items were discussed: (1) The Nanjing Municipal Government reported that the division of the provincial and municipal areas by the municipal government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government was previously ordered by the Executive Yuan to be suspended. It should be respected. Now that the military affairs have come to an end, it seems that it should continue to be handled. It is hereby submitted for your review and approval, and you are requested to order the Ministry of Interior to promptly convene a meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the municipal government to carry out the division of the provincial and municipal boundaries and the transfer of powers to facilitate progress. The resolution was approved. (2) The Ministry of Interior submitted a report on the issue of the jurisdiction of the area within the city of Weihaiwei. According to the request of various groups within the city of Weihaiwei, the city should be划歸to the Weihaiwei Management Office for management, which is in line with the provisions of the provincial, municipal, and county boundary survey regulations. It seems that it can be approved as requested to order compliance. Furthermore, whether the name of the administrative area of the Weihaiwei Management Office should still use the special district or remove the word "special" and temporarily call it the Weihai Administrative District will be submitted to the National Government for approval and implementation after reaching the level of establishing a city.

The resolution was transferred to the government for separate appointments and recordings.</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Goes to Wu to Preside Over Guangxi Affairs</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of Small Battles Near Nanning</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication - The Guangxi war has been silent for a long time. Recently, because the situation in the north has been resolved, the central government has paid close attention to the military affairs in the southwest. It is rumored that the 19th Route Army of Jiang Guangnai will go south to first剿湘赣bandit communists, and then move into Guangxi to cooperate with the Eighth Route and Tenth Route armies currently stationed in Guangxi to completely clean up the Guangxi situation in order to avoid exhausting the army and wasting money and resources and causing suffering to the people. Recently, the Zhang Gui army in Guangxi has occupied the three places of Guilin, Liuzhou, and Yongzhou, appearing and disappearing unpredictably. They often use skirmishers to harass the positions of the Eighth Route Army. According to the latest report, on the 12th, the Eighth Route Army suddenly discovered the Eighth Route Army of the Gui Army in the Qianjiang and Laibin area. Since the 10th, the Yu Hanmou division of the Eight Route Army was transferred from Binyang back to Nanning. The Litang and Tantang areas were only guarded by the Teaching Brigade of Huang Renhuan. The Gui Army's Yang Tenghui division suddenly rushed out in the Si Long area. The Yu division immediately met them head-on. After fierce battles in the area on the 11th and 12th, the Yunnan Army joined the battle and finally repelled the Yang division, which fled to Nanning and Wuming. It was found that the Gui Army's descent from Liuzhou and Yongzhou was actually to relieve the siege of Nanning, so the military affairs of the Dahe River have become tense again these days. According to the report from the front line yesterday, the commander of the Yu Division, Hanmou, said in a telegram on the 12th that (1) it was reported that the remnants of the enemy in the villages between Shanglin and Tingliang had moved to Matou on the 10th. At present, only a few militias occupy each of those places. (2) Li Zhenqiu's Brigade and the Teaching Regiment had a fierce battle with the enemy for four hours in Taisou South at noon on the 12th. The enemy collapsed toward Zhendong. The brigade has occupied Si Long and so on. According to the report, the headquarters specially transferred the second battalion of Zhang Jingcheng's regiment and the machine gun company and artillery company to open more than ten civilian ships from Wu to Pingnan to intercept the remnants of the enemy, and on the morning of the 14th, they increased the transfer of the supplementary regiment of the 63rd Division, Lin Bin's troops, to Guixian. The city of Wuzhou is temporarily guarded by military police and the teaching regiment of the 63rd Division. Chen Jitang, the commander-in-chief of the Eighth Route Army, was tense in front of him again. Whether it was peace or war, it must be resolved in a short period of time. Chenjitang had to return to Wuzhou as soon as possible to preside over everything. Therefore, on the 14th, he went to the west with his secretary Cheng Bijin and others. He telegraphed the waterway and land agencies in advance to prepare ships and cars. At 12:30 on the same day, Chen took a car to Huangsha Wharf and transferred to the Xiaokunlun electric ship to the Shuweitang Station of the Guangsan Railway. At that time, there were many military and political leaders at the station to send him off. Chen performed the ceremonies one by one, and then boarded the No. 100 special train and drove away. Before the incident, the Naval Department pre-arranged the Zhixin ship to go to Hekou to raise fire and wait for the driver. At about 2 p.m., Chen arrived at Sanshui Hekou and transferred to the Zhixin ship. On the evening of the 14th, he arrived at Zhaoqing and stayed overnight at the Independent Brigade Headquarters. On the morning of the 15th, he reviewed the garrison forces, the second and third regiments of the Independent Brigade, in Zhao. On the afternoon of the 15th, he went from Zhaoqing to Wu. It was said that after Chen understood the situation, he might go to the front to inspect the military affairs. (October 15)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Henan Theater Bombing Case</h3>
<p>Thugs Resort to Bombing After Extortion Fails</p>
<p>One Actor Killed and Four Injured in the Blast</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The atmosphere of banditry in Guangdong Province has been rampant recently. Banditry on the rivers and looting of villages are common occurrences. Recently, bandits in the vicinity of the city have become even more blatant, sending letters of extortion. When they fail, they resort to drastic measures, often harming innocent people, which is truly shocking. In recent years, Cantonese opera troupes have become targets for bandits due to their relatively high incomes and extravagant spending. Last week, the Yongshou Nian opera troupe received a letter from Jian Wei, the leader of a bandit gang in Panyu, demanding 3,000 yuan from eight members of the troupe, stating that it must be paid within three days, or they would face severe consequences. The eight actors, accustomed to such letters, ignored it. Two days ago, Jian Wei sent another letter, specifically demanding 2,000 yuan from actors Qianliju and Bai Yutang, which they also ignored. On the evening of the 14th, the Henan Theater was performing the opera "Song Huang Tai," which was being performed by the Yongshou Nian troupe. The bandits saw this as an opportunity and sent accomplices to infiltrate the theater. During the performance, amidst the loud music and noise, they secretly placed a bomb under a costume box in front of the stage. Fortunately, the bomb was a percussion type and did not explode immediately. After the performance ended, around 12 midnight, the audience filed out. Because the troupe was scheduled to perform at the Taiping Theater the next day, they needed to move their costumes and props about 25 minutes after the Henan Theater closed. At this time, the actors had already left, leaving only assistants and stagehands to handle the transportation of the boxes. Unexpectedly, while moving the eighth costume box on the right side of the stage (where the bandits had hidden the bomb), they accidentally triggered the detonator. A loud explosion occurred, with thick smoke and debris flying everywhere. A large hole was blown in the ground, and the surrounding walls and objects were damaged by shrapnel. More than ten people who were nearby collecting costumes were injured. Li Lin, a 35-year-old man from Shunde who played a soldier, was killed instantly. The next day (the 15th), the court sent officials to inspect the scene. Li Lin suffered one wound each on his left armpit and right side, each about three-tenths of an inch wide, with torn skin. Four other people were injured: Cai Peinian, 25 years old, from Xinhui, suffered serious injuries to his head, feet, and hands; Tan Jie, 25 years old, from Xinhui, suffered serious injuries to his head, body, and feet; Li Wenlong, 35 years old, from Xinhui, suffered minor injuries to his right thigh; and Pan Peinian, 25 years old, from Panyu, suffered minor injuries to his left thigh. All were taken to Boji Hospital for treatment. Cai Peinian and Tan Jie's injuries were severe and life-threatening. Afterwards, a business card was found at the explosion site, bearing the name "Jian Wei from Panyu" and the words "Specifically bombing Bai Yutang and Qianliju" on the back. The bomb was shaped like a condensed milk can and had a very strong explosive force. The shell of the bomb was found on the ground and has been taken by the police to the Haichuang Sub-Bureau for safekeeping (October 15th evening).</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Divisions of Troops Suppressing Bandits in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>The Current Situation of Each Division Encirclement and Suppressing Communist Bandits</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Chairman Jiang, in order to actively suppress the communist bandits in Jiangxi Province, has specially dispatched a large army into Jiangxi. In addition to Zhang Huizan's 18th Division, Deng Yingxin's 13th Division, Gong Bingfan's New 5th Division, Luo Lin's New 77th Division, Liu Yi's Independent 14th Brigade, and Tan Daoyuan's 50th Division, new arrivals include Xu Kexiang's New 20th Division and Xiong Shihui's 5th Division. Li Yunjie's 23rd Division, Tao Guang's 31st Division, and Qian Dajun's 3rd Training Division have been mobilized. Jin Handing's 12th Division and Mao Bingwen's 3rd Division are preparing to depart. The total number of divisions has reached more than ten. The navy has six ships: Minzu, Minquan, Jiangxi, Jiangkun, Jiangyuan, Chutai. The air force has four fighter planes from the 1st and 5th Aviation Teams, and one reconnaissance plane. All units are under the control of the Wuhan Headquarters and commanded by the 9th Army Headquarters. Since assuming the position of Director of the Wuhan Headquarters, He Chengjun has telegraphed Jiangxi to inquire about the bandit situation and recent suppression efforts. He may come to Jiangxi to inspect everything in the future. The general situation of each unit's suppression of bandits is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>The 60th Brigade of the New 20th Division, led by Li Hualing, began departing from Pukou to Xunyang on the 15th. Division Commander Xu also led the division headquarters from Beijing to continue there yesterday. The division will be stationed in the Raozhou area of eastern Jiangxi to encircle and suppress Fang Zhimin. Fang's bandits are currently fleeing from Jingdezhen to Poyang and Duchang, advancing towards Hukou in northern Jiangxi. Pengze County was captured by Fang's bandits on the evening of the 18th, so Division Commander Xu is dedicated to severely suppressing Fang's bandits.</p>
<p>Division Commander Luo Lin of the 77th Division led Li Jue, Chen Guangzhong, and a portion of his subordinates from Hunan through Pingxiang into Jiangxi to suppress bandits. After capturing Yuanzhou, they followed Zhu De and Mao Zedong along the Yuan River, pursuing the bandits of Fenyi. Division Commander Luo arrived in Yuanzhou on the 16th and sent Tang Wenjian, the chief of the division headquarters' staff, to the province to meet with Governor Lu to report on the bandit pursuit and request instructions on everything.</p>
<p>The entire New 5th Division, led by Gong Bingfan, has arrived in Gao'an and Shanggao. The bandits in Gao'an and Shanggao fled upon hearing the news. It is reported that the division will depart from Qingjiang, head into the Yuan River, and advance towards the bandits of Xinyu and Jishui, joining forces with Zhang's division and Dai's brigade, advancing through western Jiangxi towards Ji'an.</p>
<p>After arriving in Jiangxi from Wuhan, Liu Yi's brigade was stationed in De'an, Yongxiu, and the Niuxing Train Station along the Nanchang-Jiujiang Railway.</p>
<p>After Dai's brigade captured Qingjiang and Zhu's brigade captured Xingan, the 18th Division advanced from Xingan up the Gan River towards the bandits of Xiajiang, Jishui, and Yongfeng, aiming to join forces with Gong, Liu, and Luo's units in Ji'an. Yue Sen's brigade of the 50th Division had already advanced from Zhangshu towards the Gan River. In addition to a portion guarding the provincial capital, the recently victorious 148th and 150th Brigades have all departed from the Zhangshu area to take on rear defense duties.</p>
<p>The New 13th Division was previously transferred from Fengcheng and Chongren to eastern Jiangxi. The division headquarters was established in Fuzhou, with its subordinate units deployed in Yihuang, Le'an, and Chongren to prevent Zhu De and Mao Zedong from fleeing eastward from Yongfeng through Le'an to the Fujian border (October 20th).</p>
<h3>Banditry Rises Again in the Suburbs of Fuzhou</h3>
<p>Transportation on the Min River is Also Suspended Again</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The northwest suburbs of Fuzhou have always been known for their bandits. Since the start of the campaign against Lu Xingbang, Liu Heiding’s troops have been stationed in the mountain peaks outside the suburbs, and the bandits with some strength have been incorporated into Lu’s army. So although the gunfire has been incessant, the locality has remained relatively peaceful. Now because the provincial troops have been making successive advances, the battle lines have shifted from the near suburbs of the provincial capital to the counties of Minqing and Gutian. With the entire Liu Heiding division troops stationed in each of the townships having all departed for the front, the rear defenses are inevitably relaxed. At the same time, the bandits who Lu Xingbang incorporated as his troops, such as Wu Da’ang, He En, Niu Li, Yi Kuo, and Luo Yingyuan, have all defected in droves, each leading crowds of a hundred or two people and conscripting defeated soldiers scattered by Lu’s army. They have scattered themselves in the rural villages and are causing major disturbances. In recent days, the villages of Dabeiling, Xiaobeiling, Benxi, Fengchi, Chiqiao, and Makeng in the north, and the villages of Ganze, Zhuqi, Baisha, Yangli, Muyuan, and Guanyuan in the west have completely become bandit territory. Kidnapping people, allocating contributions, seizing cattle, and robbing things have occurred repeatedly. Those who previously entered the city to avoid the fighting and who have recently returned home are now, once again, fleeing into the city to avoid banditry. The shops in the villages have been completely closed since the beginning of this month. After 5 p.m. every day, the roads are deserted. Last night, the 17th, more than a hundred bandits came to Xiaobeiling, attempting to rob and seize things. Fortunately, the villagers had received scouts’ reports during the day and quickly deposited their women and children with relatives elsewhere. They gathered two hundred people, armed with hunting rifles and wooden staves, and guarded the village entrance and the mountain top. Around 7 p.m., the bandit troop indeed pushed forward and began a fierce battle that lasted for more than two hours. Seeing that they could not break in, the bandits retreated. On the 16th, more than a hundred bandits broke into Baisha Street. Seeing that the shops were closed and the houses empty, they were greatly enraged and wanted to set fire to the entire street. Fortunately, the Qianzhuang and pawnshops came forward to negotiate, and the bandits extorted more than two thousand yuan before leaving. In recent days, the provincial and county governments and the bandit suppression headquarters have received numerous reports from various villages requesting the dispatch of troops to suppress the bandits. The headquarters, because the main forces are all fighting at the front, actually has no troops to dispatch, so it has ordered the county government to instruct the defense regiments in each district to take responsibility for searching and suppressing [the bandits]. However, after the warfare in June occurred, the firearms of the defense regiments had all been confiscated by Lu’s army. Most of the members of the regiments have also disbanded. Although preparations are being made to restore [the regiments], bare fists and empty hands are of no real use to remedy the problem. Unless the war is ended, the banditry in the near suburbs of the provincial capital can expect no thorough suppression. Also, traffic on the Min River was originally able to operate after the recapture of Shuikou by Liu Heiding’s troops. Now, because the banditry is rampant along both banks of the river, each merchant ship must pay tribute to the bandits in more than ten places from Shuikou to Hongshan Bridge, with each place demanding hundreds of yuan. If [the merchants] fail to comply, [the bandits] will seize people on the mountains to extort ransoms. Therefore, freight transport has once again fallen into suspension. The 56th Division once proposed establishing a convoy bureau in Shuikou and Hongshan Bridge, dispatching two companies of troops each to be stationed in the bureau, allowing merchants to pay fees and request military protection. Yesterday, the 17th, the various merchant guilds had already discussed the plan at the General Chamber of Commerce (October 18th).</p>
<h3>Post-War Inspection Notes on the Longhai Railway Line</h3>
<p>Various Party and Government Conditions Seen in Kaifeng</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Correspondence: Reporter Xu’s inspection group traveled from Xuzhou through Lanfeng and arrived at Bian[liang] to inspect. The group stayed in Bian[liang] for three days and then left Bian[liang] for Zhengzhou. The following is a continuation of the record of what was seen along the way:</p>
<p>Liu Zhi Speaks: The reporters’ group visited Liu Zhi at the Second Army Corps headquarters, formerly the old Governor’s Office, at 3:00 p.m. on the 14th. Liu Zhi said the following: “The war against the Communists has come to an end for the time being... [There are] remnants of the Feng army in the west of Henan... Director He Chengjun is stationed in Zhengzhou and is responsible for suppression. I was ordered to come to Bian[liang] to take care of both military and political affairs. The Feng army soldiers who retreated to Hebei mostly gathered in Jiaozuo, Qinyang, and Jiyuan. The Jin army is unwilling for the Feng troops to enter Shanxi, and the Feng troops are also very suspicious of the Jin army, so the Jin and Feng troops are disarming each other. The Central Army will prepare to cross the river to pursue [the Feng troops] after the northern bank of the Yellow River, north of Bian[liang] and Zhengzhou, has been completely suppressed. The Central Army advancing to the west captured Luoyang on the 9th, and the vanguard, Yang Hucheng’s army, has passed through Xin'an, Mianchi, and Shaanzhou and is advancing towards Tongguan. The remnants of the Feng army have retreated and gathered in Tongguan. Now I am in charge of political affairs, but because the commissioners of the various committees have not all arrived, the date of taking office has not been decided yet.”</p>
<p>Current Provincial Affairs: At noon on the 15th, [the reporters’ group] visited Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government Zhang Fang at the Provincial Government but did not find him. Li Jingliu, who is acting for the Director of Civil Affairs, received the [reporters’ group] and said regarding the current state of provincial affairs: “The Henan Provincial Committee left the province in its entirety at the same time as the Han Fuju army was ordered to withdraw eastward. After that, Yan Xueshan was appointed chairman, and after Wan Xuancai, [who was also] appointed chairman, was captured, Li Xiaolan was appointed acting chairman. The situation had already fallen into disarray. Zhang Fang, who was both the commissioner of the Henan Provincial Committee and the director of the Construction Department, was summoned by telegram from Chiang [Kai-shek] and organized a temporary provincial government in Guide on June 1. At that time, the original provincial committee consisted of only Zhang Fang and Zhang Honglie. So Zhang Fang acted as chairman and Zhang Honglie acted as director of the secretariat, which was divided into three sections: Wang Hongxian was director of general affairs, Wang Youmei was director of finance, and Li Jingliu was director of political affairs. At that time, only forty or so of Henan Province’s one hundred and ten-odd counties were under [the provincial government’s] control. Afterwards, Zhang Fang was trapped in Haozhou for more than forty days, and the provincial administration became even more difficult. After Zhang Fang escaped, Chiang appointed him as the Commander-in-Chief of the Twentieth Route Army and ordered him to collect the miscellaneous troops of Henan Province. Because of this, Zhang Fang again left Guide for the Shahe River, staying in Yancheng for more than a month and collecting the troops of Song Tiancai, Zhao Guanying, and Jiao Wendian, gathering them in western Henan to await orders. After Kaifeng was recovered, Zhang Fang arrived in Kaifeng from the west, and the temporary provincial government also moved from Guide to Kaifeng on the 5th. However, the original provincial committee consisted of only Zhang Fang and Zhang Honglie, which was difficult to distribute [among provincial] affairs. It was decided that Zhang would act as chairman and concurrently as director of the Construction Department and the Finance Department, and Zhang Honglie would concurrently be the director of the Education Department and the Civil Department, while Wang Hongxian would act as director of the Construction Department, Wang Youmei would act as director of the Finance Department, and Li Jingliu would act as director of the Civil Department, separately taking over provincial affairs and starting to reorganize them. However, after the great war, most of the personnel in the political and financial organs of each county were conveniently appointed by military organs, and it was difficult to unify [them] administratively. In particular, it will be difficult to provide relief to the disaster areas because large sums of money are needed. When the temporary provincial government was in Guide, it organized a disaster area investigation and consolation group, and distributed forms to the counties for filling out and reporting. It also appealed to the central government and relief agencies to request aid. After moving to Kaifeng, it requested Commander-in-Chief Chiang to allocate 200,000 yuan for the consolation of war casualties in the war zones. Currently, the central government has approved the allocation of 100,000 yuan to handle emergency relief. However, because the disaster is severe and the funds are small, it is still difficult to distribute [them]. It is currently working on reorganizing the relief association so that it can be responsible for handling the relief efforts in various places, such as Minquan, Lanfeng, Weishi, Ningling, Qi County, Kaocheng, Taikang, Luyi, Zhecheng, Shangqiu, Chenliu, Tongxu, Yuancheng, Weishi, Xinzheng, Lin Ying, Xuchang, and Huaiyang. These are all severely affected areas, with losses in each county mostly exceeding one million. Even with large sums of money for relief during this recent period, it will not be easy to recover. It is the good fortune of the people of Henan that the press is fully publicizing the failure to unify administration and the urgent need for disaster relief.” Later, when the reporter asked about the fact that the Zhang’s replacement as acting chairman had been appointed to the new provincial committee and heard that he had resigned, Li said that Zhang was from Xin'an County and that his family had a Minsheng coal mine in Xin'an. This time, Feng Yuxiang became jealous of him for managing the situation in Henan, and the family mines in Shaanxi and Xin'an were searched and confiscated. Moreover, [Zhang] was imperiled in Haozhou for many days and ran around Yancheng on military affairs. At this point, he also wanted to rest a bit and did not have any other meaning. Zhang is currently resting, so you gentlemen did not find him when you visited. The new provincial committee will be able to take office within the next few days. The provincial government of Henan still needs to conduct a thorough reorganization, but its essentials will not be outside the unification of administration and disaster relief. It is my humble opinion that the Central Plains can be pacified from now on, and the suffering experienced by the people of Henan is nothing short of being suffered on behalf of the people of the entire country. I hope that the people of the country will have a sense of sympathy and provide appropriate relief.”</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Party Affairs: The Henan Provincial Party Headquarters is located in the Iron Pagoda Temple. Due to the hurried journey, there was no time to visit. Li Jingliu, who was originally the secretary-general of the provincial party headquarters, is very familiar with party affairs. According to him, after leaving Kaifeng, the Henan Provincial Party Committee first performed its duties in Zhumadian and then moved to Xinyang. The Kaifeng Provincial Party Headquarters was occupied by the Reorganization Faction. After the recapture of Kaifeng, the Party Headquarters returned to Kaifeng from Xinyang just one or two days ago. However, the committee is not complete. For the time being, Han Lilun, the former standing committee member, is acting as standing committee member, Zhang Shanyu is acting as director of the Propaganda Department, Xue Guanghan is acting as director of the Training Department, and Chen Panling is acting as director of the Organization Department. There are five committee members in total, including Li He. Reorganization of party affairs in the various counties is currently being planned and implemented.</p>
<p>Municipal Construction: Although Kaifeng was in the aftermath of war, the original construction could still be seen. A common people’s village in Kaifeng City was built from the railway station to the city. The entire village is in the shape of a circle, with the Sun Yat-sen Clubhouse in the middle. The buildings are single-story and covered with tiles, simple and sturdy. The entire village is inhabited by common people and vendors, and is well-organized. It is conceivable that a lot of effort was put into the planning when it was first built. The streets in the city are wide and lack stone, so bricks were used as the roadbed. A safety water tank filled with clear water is prepared in front of every shop along the road and sprinkled three times a day, so that even in an area full of sand, there is no flying dust. The famous Dragon Pavilion in the northwest corner of the city has been converted into Sun Yat-sen Park, with a steady stream of orderly visitors. The Xiangguo Temple has been converted into the Sun Yat-sen City Market, where stalls and vendors gather. Inside there is a Revolution Memorial Hall, Art Gallery, Industry Museum, Common People's Rest Room, Common People's Lecture Hall, Folk Music Pavilion, Common People's Park, etc. Next to the Xiangguo Temple is the People's Assembly Hall, with towering walls and three stories, which can accommodate more than 10,000 people. The Bell and Drum Tower has been converted into the Sun Yat-sen Library, with reading rooms for books and newspapers. A workers’ rest room is also located near the provincial government, with provincial notices posted there. After all, it is unavoidable that [the city] has a state where the scale and spirit are still present but has lost its essence since it is in the aftermath of war. After the reporters finished their inspection in Kaifeng, they boarded a military vehicle westward at 7:00 p.m. on the 15th and arrived in Zhengzhou at 11:00 p.m. that evening (16th).</p>

Yesterday (the 20th) was the opening day of the first group meeting. The meeting was held in the assembly hall of the Provincial Government at 3:00 p.m. The attendees included Civil Affairs Department Secretary Tai Danian, Lin Yichang, Hu Huisheng, Section Chiefs Lu Changgan, Zhao Enju, Zhang Zhongli, Tian Bingzhang, Lin Wenqin, Guan Ji'an, Shanghai County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jinghua, Songjiang County Magistrate Jin Qingzhang, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhu Ying, Nanhui County Magistrate Kong Chong, Public Security Bureau Chief Jin Runzhang, Qingpu County Magistrate Yu Ding, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhu Hua, Fengxian County Magistrate Shen Qing, Public Security Bureau Chief Li Zhibin, Jinshan County Magistrate Lu Quan, Public Security Bureau Chief Shi Pengcheng, Chuansha County Magistrate Tu Guangjun, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhu Shanyuan, Taicang County Magistrate Tao Mu, Public Security Bureau Chief Xi Ziwei, Jiading County Magistrate Chen Chuande, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhu Shou, Baoshan County Magistrate Qiu Mingjiu, Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jing, Wuxian County Magistrate Huang Sichen, Public Security Bureau Chief Zou Jing, Changshu County Magistrate Tan Jigui, Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Kun, Kunshan County Magistrate Pang Shusen, Public Security Bureau Chief Qin Jieren, Wujiang County Magistrate Wu Jia, Public Security Bureau Chief Zhou Zhaonan, Wujin County Magistrate Wu Deyao, Public Security Bureau Chief Yin Peng, Yixing County Magistrate Sun Gongxin, Public Security Bureau Chief Wu Yizeng, Wuxi County Magistrate Pan Zhongjia, Public Security Bureau Chief Xu Jigui, Jiangyin County Magistrate Li Leng, Public Security Bureau Chief Li Zonggang, Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Fu, River Police District 1 Chief Chen Jiekun, River Police District 2 Chief Mao Mujun, River Police District 3 Chief Shen Weiying, and Security Section Wang Bojian. First, Chairman Hu Pu'an delivered an opening speech, stating that today's meeting is a type of meeting to plan and rectify public security matters. The provincial government's responsibility is the security of the people of the entire province, and the county government's responsibility is the security of the people of the entire county. Security is relatively easy to manage in the spring, summer, and autumn seasons, but in winter, petty criminals and unscrupulous elements will take the opportunity to cause trouble. Since the Republic of China, due to political reforms, the social security situation in these past few years should be given even more attention than before. We are now discussing winter defense matters, but the period of defense is not only in winter; we must be responsible for defense at all times. However, winter is even more important. There have been quite a few banditry disasters in various counties this year. In the province,</p>
<h2>Page 9</h2>
<h3>Domestic News</h3>
<p>The methods of trying to fundamentally eliminate banditry every day cannot be applied in general. The biggest reason is that there is no connection between counties. For example, if there are bandits in County A, County B will take a spectator's attitude. If troops are sent to suppress the bandits, they have already heard the news and fled to another county. If a county government has the strength, it can certainly eliminate [bandits], but the strength of one county is not enough to fundamentally eliminate bandits, so it is necessary for each county to connect together to suppress [the bandits]. This winter defense conference is for everyone to discuss methods of joint defense, research good opinions, increase strength, and start eliminating bandits. This is the most important point of opening the winter defense conference. If each county can earnestly suppress [the bandits] and implement joint defense plans, the bandit disasters in this province will be eliminated soon. Another point is that the situations in each county are different. Some have sufficient self-defense forces, and some do not have enough self-defense forces. If we want to eliminate bandit disasters, we must first rectify ourselves. Therefore, winter defense and rectification of police affairs are the same thing. It is hoped that the many cases submitted by each county will be thoroughly discussed and reasonable solutions will be produced. Once resolutions have been discussed and decided, they must be taken back to each county for sorting out and vigorous implementation, so that the people have the hope of living and working in peace and the county government can be considered to have fulfilled its responsibilities. Following that, Section Chief Zhang Zhongli and Jiangyin County Magistrate Li Leng and others gave speeches. After the speeches, the entire group took a photo. At 4:00 p.m., the meeting opened for discussion. It was decided that a general meeting will be held at 2:00 p.m. today (the 21st).</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Longjing Village Incident</h3>
<p>Japanese Police Conduct Armed Night Raid</p>
<p>Mistakenly Shot and Killed at a Checkpoint</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Regarding the conflict between the Japanese police and our military and civilians in Longjing Village on the 7th of this month, the Japanese news agency is expanding propaganda. We were unable to obtain the true story due to the distance and difficult roads, so we relied entirely on the Japanese side's fabrication of rumors. Yesterday, we received a very detailed telegram from various public organizations in Longjing Village stating the cause of the incident. The transcription is as follows: "At 9:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, a Chinese pear vendor surnamed Yang was involved in a quarrel and fight with a Korean man, Yu Jijun, in Funing Alley in Longjing Village, Yanji, because Yu was stealing pears. The Chinese man was seriously injured. At that time, both the Chinese and Korean parties were preparing to go to the Commercial Bureau to reason things out. It happened that a Commercial Bureau police officer intervened to mediate. Suddenly, many Japanese police officers came and wanted to arrest both our Chinese and the police officer together. The Chinese public was aroused to public indignation and gathered to reason with the Japanese police. The Japanese police were furious and fired a shot to intimidate the crowd. At that time, the Japanese police station on Dalu Road heard the gunshot and another five or six Japanese police officers poured out and actually took our police officer away. When the Commercial Bureau heard the news, it immediately dispatched the bureau's translator, along with two police officers, to negotiate. The Japanese police station admitted that it was a misunderstanding and handed over our police officer to the Commercial Bureau's translator to take back. This matter had come to an end. Afterwards, the Japanese police sought trouble for no reason, causing a misunderstanding, which is a separate matter. We fear that rumors will be lost in transmission, so we are sending a special telegram to report it." Another telegram said: "Longjing Village is an important town on the Yanbian border. Because of defense, martial law has been in effect for several months recently. However, at 10:00 p.m. on the 6th of this month, more than a dozen armed men suddenly opened fire on the sentry. In self-defense, the sentry returned fire, killing two of the enemy and wounding one. After investigation, it was learned that the two who were killed were all wearing Japanese police uniforms, one holding a Binyin pistol and the other holding a Type 38 rifle. According to the Chief Inspector of the Japanese Consulate, Secret Tail, the injured person is Takahashi, and those killed are Yoshioka and Fujita, etc. No terms of negotiation have yet been proposed, but 103 armed Japanese police officers were sent from Korea as early as the 9th. They paraded on the same day, causing panic among merchants and civilians. It is heard that they are also planning to successively increase the number of police officers. An investigation shows that more than a dozen armed Japanese police officers are deliberately demonstrating in the dark of night during this period of martial law. It is evident that they intend to cause trouble by freely entering our inland under the pretext of increasing the number of police officers. The Japanese newspaper is therefore making one-sided propaganda. Please correct it immediately. In order to save the country, the merchants, farmers, workers, and students of Yanbian are all so angry that they want to die. We hope that everyone will advocate justice. The Yanbian Federation of Agriculture, Commerce, Industry, and Students in Longjing Village bows and presents [this information]. Truly." The Japanese consul stationed in Jilin has already lodged a strongly worded protest on the 9th of this month. The provincial government has telegraphed Zhang Shuhan, the head of the Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office, to investigate the matter locally and has ordered the garrison commander, Ji Xing, to reply with the truth (13th).</p>
<h3>Wuhu Quick Letter</h3>
<p>The Anhui Province Sixth District Bandit Suppression Commander is Lv Xueshu, the commander of the Capital Garrison Regiment stationed in Wuhu. Recently, the regiment was ordered to be transferred back to Nanjing, and the Sixth District Bandit Suppression Command was also abolished. Recently, the Anhui Provincial Bandit Suppression Commander-in-Chief, Wei Lihuang, reported that the bandit disasters in southern Anhui have not been suppressed and that large numbers of communist bandits have been discovered in the Langxi and Guangde areas, and that bandit suppression cannot be the responsibility of anyone. He therefore requested and was approved by Commander-in-Chief Jiang to appoint Xu Guoting, the commander of the 341st Regiment of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu, as the new Sixth District Bandit Suppression Commander yesterday by telegram, and ordered him to organize a command headquarters in Wuhu immediately and be responsible for suppressing the communist bandits in Yiguang and other eleven counties.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau and Xu Guoting's regiment of the 57th Division stationed in Wuhu have reorganized the joint military-police inspection office for the sake of local security. It was established today. In addition to the military and police sending teams to form a joint patrol team, the merchant corps also sent a platoon of soldiers to join. The director of the office is Su Kaiyuan, the adjutant of Xu Guoting, and the deputy director is Sun Wenhua, the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Chen Diaoyuan has ordered Ruan Zhaochang's troops, who are now in Liuhe, to station themselves in southern Anhui for training now that the military affairs at the front have come to an end. Ruan's troops are prepared to depart and yesterday specially telegraphed the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau to find housing for the troops to station in.</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, more than a hundred bandits suddenly came to Huangchi Town, 40 miles from Wuhu, and plundered the town. The extent of the losses is unknown. People have now been sent to investigate (20th).</p>

<h3>松江</h3>
<p>The First Purchasing Cooperative Holds Autumn Member Congress: The Songjiang First Purchasing Cooperative is a farmer-organized fertilizer purchasing organization. Since its establishment in May of last year, members have had strong confidence in the cooperative. On the 19th of this month, the third member congress was held, proposing an additional 5,000 yuan in share capital, which was unanimously approved. It is said that the share subscription is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Various Agencies Unsuccessful in Retaining the Water Police Team: The First Team of the First District of the Water Police Force of Jiangsu Province stationed in Songjiang used to be stationed in Minhang. Now, because Jinshan has repeatedly reported bandit police incidents, local communities have petitioned the province to move the team to Jinshan to deter them. However, the county chamber of commerce, the property disposal office, and the district office of this county believe that Songjiang is a strategic location between Shanghai and Hangzhou, with the westward transportation of willow dregs and the northern reliance on the Nine Peaks. Bandit police incidents are frequently reported in the four townships. Except for the team's location in Songjiang, it is easier to respond to emergencies. Therefore, they telegraphed Chen, the district chief of Minhang, the other day to avoid any changes. Now, they have received a response from District Chief Chen, stating that one team's defense area also covers Songjiang and Jinshan. Recently, due to the weakness of the military force in Jin County, bandits have repeatedly harassed Lvxiang, Yanxia, and Qianxu and other public security sub-bureaus. The defense regiment's firearms were also seized by bandits, and the people were in a state of panic and could not live in peace. Therefore, there was a proposal to move the first division to Jinshan, and it was submitted to the Ministry of Civil Affairs for approval. Your county has a stronger strength and has a customs anti-smuggling team stationed there. In fact, there is relatively little to worry about. Our district has limited resources to meet local needs and has to make slight changes. It is said that the team will have to move in this year.</p>
<p>Organizing a Review and Price Equalization Committee: After the end of the price equalization in this county, it was discovered that there were malpractices in the ninth district, which had to be thoroughly reviewed to restore public funds. The county party headquarters proposed the organization of a review committee at the last party headquarters conversation meeting, which was approved. The price equalization bureau convened a closing meeting today. The review committee members recommended by the county party headquarters were Lu Changlin and Yang Tianduo, and the county government recommended Zhou Qi and Zhang Yinzi. The price equalization committee members recommended Zhang Huanzhi, Lu Kangsheng, and Zhang Shaomei as members. A meeting will be convened on a regular basis.</p>
<h3>Qingpu</h3>
<p>A Quarrel Leads to a Fatal Case: Ke Yongquan, the shopkeeper of Yongtai Youbinghao in Zhanglianyong Township, Third District of this county, had a quarrel with Shen Youqing and Shen Yumei, the shopkeepers of Yan Yi Mao and Jin Xin Chang Youbinghao in the town. The two Shen brothers, on the other day, carried wooden weapons and rushed to the Yongtai Youbinghao, seeking to beat Ke on the head, causing him to fall to the ground with serious injuries. The shopkeeper reported to the local Public Security Second Sub-bureau, and the bureau only arrested the two murderers the next day and fined them. However, Ke suffered excessive injuries and the treatment was ineffective. He died two days later. The corpse family reported to the county for an autopsy. The county government sent personnel to perform an autopsy and found that Ke had been beaten to death before his death. The county government ordered the corpse family to collect the corpse and wait for the arrest of the murderer for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>A Police Officer Sentenced to Imprisonment for Fraud: Ma Yixiang, a police officer of the First Team of the County Police Force, falsely asked for leave last month and sneaked to the home of Shi Yongkui, a prisoner serving a sentence in Tiansheng Village. He falsely claimed to Shi's mother, Shi Wu, that Shi was seriously ill and that if she could pay 150 yuan, he could arrange for him to be released. Shi's mother believed it to be true and went by boat to the city to reluctantly raise the money from relatives and friends and handed it over to the police officer. They went to the county government to wait for the redemption. After Ma entered, he immediately left from the back door and sneaked back to the team. Shi Wu waited for a long time and asked people before she realized she had been cheated. The county government learned of this and ordered the First Team to detain the criminal and bring him to the county for repeated interrogation. The criminal could not deny it and was sentenced to six years and eight months of imprisonment in accordance with the regulations on the abuse of public office to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Retrial of the Shanghai Murder Case: Fang Jianwen, who lived on the overpass of a toothbrush factory on Huining Road in Shanghai, was killed by his wife, Yu, in collusion with her lover, Zhang Huairen, on the evening of the ninth day of the first month of the lunar calendar last year. Fang's body was abandoned in a nearby cemetery. The murderer immediately fled. On the thirteenth of this month, the body was discovered by a scavenger. The police district in charge reported it and the local court sent personnel to perform an autopsy. Zhang Huairen was arrested immediately and handed over to the local court, which sentenced him to death. Zhang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which upheld the original judgment. Zhang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the Supreme Court, which sent it back to the High Court for a retrial last month. Yesterday (21st), Lin Dawen, the presiding judge of the First Criminal Division of the High Court, summoned the local security chief Jian Qing and Fang Jianru, the brother of the deceased, to court for a trial.</p>
<p>Large Batch of Military Prisoners Escorted from Shanghai to Suzhou: The Shanghai Garrison Command escorted more than 200 military prisoners to the Suzhou Second Army Prison yesterday (21st). The Public Security Bureau learned of the chaos in advance and dispatched a platoon of police and two platoons of mounted patrolmen to the station to wait. After arriving in Suzhou at 5:00, they cooperated in escorting the prisoners to the Second Army Prison outside Panmen for detention.</p>
<p>Suspected Reactionaries Escorted to the Province for Interrogation: The Public Security Bureau dispatched the investigation team leader Zhou Hongjiang at 12:48 noon yesterday (21st) to escort ten suspected reactionaries, including Yao Xuan and Gu Rongchuan, to the province for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Factories Advocate for Government Funding to Maintain Operations: The Wuxi Silk Factory Guild convened an extraordinary general membership meeting yesterday morning regarding the joint Zhejiang-Shanghai petition to the government to allocate funds to maintain operations and issue public bonds. Representatives from 39 factories attended, with Qian Fenghao presiding. He first reported on the case of requesting the government to issue silk industry public bonds to rescue the industry. The method for each factory to independently decide on the public bond loan and the issue of loan responsibility were resolved at the 18th general meeting. However, the method for repaying the debt after the loan is of great importance to the interests of the industry. Because the industry requested a reconsideration, it should be carefully studied and decided so that the five Wuxi representatives can follow it when attending the meeting. After the representatives present made a long and practical discussion, they finally resolved: (1) The loan amount that Wuxi should receive must be received and distributed evenly by the Wuxi company. (2) The establishment of a bank will not be recognized temporarily after the silk industry maintenance funds are borrowed. (3) Shanghai Qiahe and Suzhou Ruifeng are silk factories run by foreign merchants. Since they are open for business in Chinese territory, they should be treated equally. When the silk from these two factories is exported, 20 taels should be deducted to show uniformity. If the above three points cannot be done, the Wuxi silk factories would rather withdraw and not borrow this maintenance fee. The above resolutions were resolved and the five Wuxi representatives recorded the case and carried it to Shanghai to present it for discussion at the special committee meeting for requesting funds today (22nd).</p>
<p>Resolution of the Strike at the Defeng Silk Factory: The workers of the Defeng Silk Factory outside Nanmen went on a full strike on the 17th, organizing a strike committee due to the capital's implementation of the guild's resolution to reduce wages by 20% and cancel the bonus work. After two days of stalemate, the county party rectification committee and the workers' rectification committee, fearing that reactionary elements would incite trouble, specially sent Lu Zhenwen and Liu Qidi to investigate the factory workshop and ordered them to send representatives to negotiate with the factory. The factory's chief manager Che Yang Peifeng, as the full representative, jointly negotiated and decided on the following methods: (1) The labor representative is responsible for notifying all workers to resume work uniformly on the same day. (2) The capital representative is responsible for paying the wages for September in full after the resumption of work, without any deduction. (3) The wages for October will be determined by the county party headquarters, the county government, the workers' rectification committee, and the silk factory guild. The capital shall not unilaterally reduce wages. (4) The salaries of all employees shall be handled in the same way as the workers. The above articles were signed on the spot by the representatives of both labor and capital, and work was resumed on the same day.</p>
<p>The County Director of Liyang Was Arrested and Escorted to the Province: Liyang County suffered repeated disturbances from the Broadsword Society bandits last year, and the local vitality was greatly damaged. Recently, Pan Bin, the director of the county finance bureau, took the opportunity to collude with Zheng Chengyuan, the county magistrate, and falsely reported to the provincial government that the county's financial bureau's grain serials were lost due to the bandit disturbances, and that the year was also a year of famine, requesting exemption from this year's land tax. The provincial government was deceived and approved the exemption, while Pan Bin, the director of the finance bureau, still collected the taxes according to the number and filled his own pockets. The local people secretly reported to the provincial finance department, which sent Section Chief Qian Jiaxiang to investigate and found that it was true. He reported to Chairman Ye truthfully. Chairman Ye immediately sent Section Chief Qian to bring the guards Du Liangmo, Jiang Jinhuan, Li Huaizheng, Shen Yusheng, Li Zhengtin, Yan Guishan, etc. to Liyang to the county government to show the official documents and take Zheng Chengyuan, the county magistrate, Pan Bin, the director of the finance bureau, and the important corrupt officials Shen Zhiqing and Cao Qingzhi to the province. After the finance department inquired, it handed Pan, Shen, and Cao over to the guards for supervision. County Magistrate Zheng Chengyuan was supervised by two officials from the provincial government, Wang and Hu. They are currently residing in Room 30 of the Donglin Hotel, and the situation is very strict, but the treatment is still good.</p>
<p>Preparations for the Establishment of a Wheat Inspection Office: The Shanghai Agricultural Product Inspection Office, directly under the Ministry of Agriculture and Mines of the National Government, previously requested the Shanghai Flour Mill Association to ban the mixing of wheat with cement impurities and other malpractices. The Ministry of Agriculture and Mines approved the implementation of inspections. Jin Jiansi, the director of the Shanghai Inspection Office, believes that Wuxi is the center of Shanghai and Nanjing, and the volume of wheat exports and imports by land and water is very large. It is necessary to set up an office for inspection. He specially appointed Gu Fooki (a native of Wuxi) as the director of the Wuxi Inspection Office. Gu came to Wuxi the other day to actively prepare.</p>
<p>A Female Teacher Committed Suicide by Poisoning Before Her Wedding: Qian Yuying, a 17-year-old primary school teacher at the Nanyangli School in Guangfu Gate, is intelligent and beautiful. She currently lives with her maternal grandmother, Wu, on Dongxin Road. In April of this year, her maternal grandmother arranged for a matchmaker, Fei, to marry her to Guo, a merchant from Bashiqiao (Guo is 27 years old and works at the Gan Da Candle Shop outside the North Gate). At that time, a betrothal gift of 200 yuan was given, and it was stated that the marriage would take place in three years. However, in the summer, the Guo family suddenly sent a post through the matchmaker to choose yesterday as the date of the wedding. Qian Yuying expressed her dissatisfaction with the early wedding date. Her maternal grandmother immediately comforted her with kind words. Yesterday, the Guo family rented the Luchang Hotel on Hanchang Road as a wedding hall for the wedding. The wedding hall was filled with congratulatory guests and the bride's family prepared everything. Unexpectedly, Qian Yuying saw this situation and was extremely angry. She made an excuse to go out and bought a bottle of tranquilizer and returned home to secretly swallow it and close the door to sleep. The family members noticed and invited Dr. Zhu from the Brothers Hospital to the house to diagnose and administer two injections of a cardiotonic drug to turn the crisis into safety. At 9:00 in the evening, the Guo family took her away and completed the wedding in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>The River Port Merchant Corps Searches Bandit Dens: Banditry and kidnapping cases in the fifth district of Beizou, Wuyi County, have emerged one after another recently. The local people learned that the bandit dens were in Sanhuang Temple, Caijiatou, and Zoujiacun. The Sanhekou Merchant Corps discovered that bandit Xi Binggen was arrested by the Wucheng Joint Defense Office, and bandit Jin Yueliang confessed that Caijiatou was indeed a bandit den. The Sanhekou Merchant Corps organized a team to Caijiatou to search the other day, but the bandits had already fled after hearing the news. Only two quick guns and one box of bullets were found. A strict investigation is still underway.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The Heads of Schools in the City Jointly Request Payment of Salaries: The Changshu education board has been owing salaries to the teachers and staff of schools for almost four and a half months. The accumulated arrears (from last year) amount to two and a half months, and the new arrears are about three months. It is difficult for most teachers to work on an empty stomach. Yesterday, the heads of schools in the city gathered at Siwen Elementary School to discuss methods for requesting payment of salaries. The heads of schools in the first district were also present. As a result, they first appealed to the education bureau and political party organs, and then recommended Lu Guanying from the preschool elementary school, Yang Junhe from the responsibility school, and Cao Jichang from the county junior high school as spokespersons. Then they went to the education bureau to petition. Director Gao Zishan extended an audience to the representatives and presented a petition. Director Gao repeatedly stated the difficulties and urged the principals to maintain their efforts. It is estimated that one or one and a half installments will be issued by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. The representatives then withdrew, and did not petition the party and government due to time constraints.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Li Hongze's Case Awaits Disposition: Li Hongze, a former inspector of the Public Security Bureau, was reported by Xuan Xingbao to the Public Security Bureau for a gun case and for plotting to rob Shuiyue Nunnery with Xu Yun, Xu Yongliang, and Li Rongbao. The county interrogated him several times and sent Li Hongze and others to the provincial government for review. The provincial government then sent it back to the original Jiangyin County for interrogation. Yesterday (20th) afternoon, Xuan Xingbao was summoned and Li Hongze and the other three were brought to court. The interrogator Yang Cheng interrogated Xuan Xingbao. Xuan Xingbao confessed that they came to call for wine at the hotel. At Li Rongbao's house, he saw Xu Yun with a gun and only heard that they wanted to go to Shuiyue Nunnery. The rest he did not hear. When asked, Li Rongbao, Xu Yun, and Xu Yongliang claimed that they went to Shuiyue Nunnery to see a sky lantern and did not know whether it was a divine fire or a ghost fire. Li Hongze claimed that the gun was lost in the China Merchants Hotel and was picked up by Xu Yun. After the interrogation, the court ordered them to be sent elsewhere for disposition.</p>

<p>The Lake Survey Team Comes to the County: Sun Boqin, the head of the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department's Great Lake Survey Team, led the entire team from Suzhou to the county yesterday to survey the entire line from Wuxian to Zhenze Town on the border of Zhejiang Province in this county. The entire line can be surveyed in about a week.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Opposition to the Chamber of Commerce's Collection of Electricity Surtax: The Suzhou-Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce plans to collect a surtax on electricity due to financial difficulties. After discussion, everyone believes that electricity is related to shops and households. It is against the law and violates the facts. The public unanimously opposes the electricity industry and does not recognize it. The Jiangsu Provincial Private Electricity Association has submitted a petition to the government requesting the Chamber of Commerce to find other ways to maintain the electricity industry.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Lvsi Field Manager Reports Sea Banditry Infestation: The Lvsi Field Manager reports to the Lianghuai Salt Transportation Department that the sea bandits have landed and invaded Lvsi. The report states that Pan Kaiwu, Yan Zhenling, Song Lishan, etc., led 14 bandit ships with about 300-400 bandits fully armed and landed with unknown intentions. The field manager re-examined the facts and immediately joined with local agencies to step up prevention. It was found that the bandits were either on ships or on the shore with unsettled movements. They also posted a notice claiming to be Song Lishan, the director of the Fisheries Protection Office of the Chinese Red Army. It was recently heard that Shen Guanxi led more than ten bandit ships to anchor in the ocean, wanting to fight against Pan, Yan, Song, and other bandits. The two groups of sea bandits are more than ten miles apart and are preparing for war. Recently, the Songhu Bandit Suppression Headquarters has ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department to suppress them.</p>
<p>The Head of the County Court is Changed: Dong Banggan, the head of the Nantong County Court, was transferred by the Ministry of Justice to be a judge of the High Court Branch, and Jian Kuiyang was appointed to replace him. Jian took office on the 20th.</p>

The military police arrested Gu Daxing and other four people on the spot and sent them to the county. After the military and political commission tried them, they were submitted to the higher authorities for punishment.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Province Orders the Construction of an Airport: The Jiangdu County Government received an order from the province yesterday that the bandit forces in northern Jiangsu were rampant. The headquarters approved the allocation of two aircraft to assist in the suppression of bandits. The telegram ordered Yangzhou to quickly find an open field for landing. After receiving the order, Chen, the county magistrate, ordered the Public Security Bureau to search. It is now heard that the director of the Public Security Bureau, Chen Lu, and the former president of the Aviation Promotion Association, Wang Jingting, have been instructed to handle the matter. It has now been determined that the Dajiaochang outside the West Gate will be the landing site and a map has been drawn and submitted to the county for approval.</p>
<p>Fugitive's Private Possession of Guns Affects Neighbors: The Criminal Investigation Team of the County Police Force received a tip that Zhou Er, one of the large number of fugitives from the detention center, had returned home (living in Jiangwang Temple). The team's criminal investigators secretly went to the place to arrest him. Unexpectedly, Zhou had already fled to another place with his family. The officers found a long gun in the canopy near the surname's residence and took the owner of the canopy, Wen, back to the headquarters for review.</p>
<p>Two Public Security Bureau Directors Accused: Party member Yin Shangbai reported to the county that the directors of the 80th and 2nd Public Security Bureaus were protecting opium dens and collecting fees privately. The county has ordered the Public Security Bureau to investigate and reply. It is also heard that the director of the 6th Public Security Bureau embezzled more than 300 yuan in fines and swallowed the August salary. The September salary was issued only after the August police salary was withheld, which caused dissatisfaction among the long-term police and they filed a complaint with the superiors.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Shops Around the Sunhui Bridge Petition for Reconstruction: The shops on the east and west sides of Sunhui Bridge outside the east gate of this county are lined up and are a prosperous area. Now, in order to facilitate transportation by rickshaw, the county government has dismantled the old-fashioned bridges one after another. However, due to limited funds, it has not been possible to completely rebuild them, and only the bridge abutments have been paved on the original bridge foundation to allow vehicles to pass, so that the bridge abutments are higher than the ground, which covers the shops on both sides and hinders business. The Sunhui Bridge is now also being dismantled. It started demolition the other day, but the bridge body is too high and the bridge abutments are too high from the ground. At a moderate point, it is more than two feet, so that more than 20 shops are covered. Therefore, the merchants raised hundreds of yuan to completely dismantle and rebuild the bridge to avoid the shops being covered by the bridge abutments and hindering business. They have reported the situation to the county government for instructions.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Telegraph Request to Send Personnel for Re-Inspection of Bridges: The Jiao and Zhi Bridges in Jiaxing County were proposed by the County Construction Bureau and approved by the County Construction Committee for renovation and construction. The construction has been completed and the county has submitted a request to the Construction Department to send personnel for acceptance. The Construction Department has sent Zhou to Jiaxing for acceptance. It is now learned that the County Executive Committee believes that although the construction of the two bridges has been completed, they do not conform to the design drawings, which makes the bridge openings smaller than the original, making it difficult for boats to pass and causing river blockage. This is very important to the residents' drinking water. Therefore, the 53rd meeting resolved to telegraph the Provincial Executive Committee to telegraph the Provincial Government to quickly order the Construction Department to send civil engineering specialists with rich experience to Jiaxing to conduct a re-inspection with representatives of various groups to emphasize construction.</p>
<p>Call for Overlapping Surtaxes on Land Tax: The surtaxes added to the Jiaxing land tax compensation have long exceeded the limits set by the ministry. This year, five jiao for district autonomous administrative expenses and six jiao for land consolidation expenses have been added to the land tax compensation, making it even more difficult for the people to bear. Therefore, local citizens Sheng Yuan and Zhang Baoming have submitted petitions to the Finance Department, the Provincial Government, and the Executive Yuan and Finance Department of the National Government calling for the abolition. They have received a reply from the Ministry of Finance that it has ordered the Zhejiang Finance Department to order the county government to convene local public groups to publicly assess land prices and calculate whether the normal and surtaxes under the land tax exceed 1% of the land price. Sheng Yuan and others submitted a petition to the Finance Department the other day requesting that it quickly order the Jiaxing County Government to convene a public land price meeting of local public groups.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Robbed Four Boats: On the 18th, six bandits speaking Henan dialect were suddenly discovered in the Wushanjian Bridge area of Changxing County. Each held a wooden-cased gun and waited by the bridge to rob passing boats. That day, Wu and others' rice boats returning from selling rice, as well as candle core boats and civilian boats, were robbed. The bandits forced all the boats to stop and searched them one by one. All the silver dollars were swept away, resulting in a loss of about 200 yuan, and the candle core passengers were kidnapped.</p>
<p>Xu Jinsheng Beaten His Younger Brother to Death with a Carrying Pole: Xu Jinsheng, a resident of Fugu, outside the south gate of Changxing, suddenly quarreled with his younger brother, Ahe, the other day. They first started with a quarrel and then resorted to violence. After neighbors persuaded them to stop, Ahe complained to his neighbor, Qiu Caifa. When Jinsheng learned of this, he took a carrying pole and ambushed in front of Qiu's house. Not long after, Ahe came out of Qiu's house, and Jinsheng used the carrying pole to hit Ahe's waist several times in a row. After being hit, Ahe endured the pain and fled back to Qiu Caifa's house. However, Ahe's internal injuries were too severe and he died despite medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Construction Department Promotes Housing for the Poor in Various Counties: The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, in view of the increasing population and the scarcity of housing in recent years, and the fact that landlords are harshly increasing rents and arbitrarily oppressing tenants, is seeking to remedy the situation in order to relieve the suffering of tenants in various counties. It has decided to build dozens of houses in each county at a low price for rent. The construction funds will be allocated from local public funds, and the rent collected will be used as public fund interest and house repair fees. The construction affairs will be presided over by the County Property Committee and assisted by the county government. The department has ordered the county magistrates to plan in earnest.</p>
<p>The Maritime Administration Bureau Established a Provincial Shipyard: The Zhejiang Maritime Administration Bureau believes that, apart from steamships, most of the other civilian ships in the province are built by private shipyards that stick to old methods and have no innovation. Therefore, it has been unable to fully facilitate water transportation. Therefore, it is now planning to establish a larger shipyard to improve the construction of sailing ships on the one hand and to repair the damage of motor ships on the other. It will be established as soon as 80,000 yuan has been raised and will be located on the border of Zhenhai.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Disputes over Rent Estimation and Harvest in Tenancy: The early and late rice harvests in the southern township of Xiaoshan this year have been very abundant. Regardless of high or low fields, the actual grain harvest is more than four dan. However, the tenants are only willing to estimate the maximum harvest at three dan. The owners naturally do not care about this, so disputes arise frequently. Both tenants and owners have asked the party and county authorities for a solution.</p>
<p>The Provincial Committee Thoroughly Investigates the Complaint Case: Li Yuan, the director of the Linpu Public Security Sub-bureau in Xiaoshan, was previously accused of various misdeeds by merchants Zhao Zhenqi, Lu Huaiqing, Tang Jie Mei, and Shen Che, etc. to the provincial government. The province ordered Xiaoshan County to investigate and reply to each item. Recently, the Department of Civil Affairs believed that the case was still untrue, so it commissioned Lou Zhenghua, a new political instructor from the Department of Civil Affairs, to investigate each item thoroughly and report back to the province.</p>
<p>Two Families in the Southern Township Robbed in One Night: Wei Amao and Zhang Yu's families, residents of the southern township of Xiaoshan in the villages of Heshangdian and Zhangcun, were known for their wealth. At 12:00 on the night of the 17th, a group of bandits suddenly came with a large number of people, speaking various dialects, with torches and sticks, and broke into the door. First, they robbed Wei Amao's house and then the family of Zhang Yu in the same village was also robbed. The search lasted about two hours before the thieves left with their loot to the south. It is said that after the two families checked, they lost about 2,000 yuan worth of soft valuables and clothes.</p>

<p>Important News in Education</p>
<h3>Expanding Turmoil at Central University</h3>
<p>Students Present Eighteen Demands</p>
<p>Alumni Association Unanimously Supports Demands</p>
<p>School Administration to be Reorganized</p>
<p>Zhang Zuoshi Forced to Leave the School</p>
<p>Since Central University students Tu Juyiao and 290 others voiced corrective opinions regarding the school's recent facilities, demanding reform in school affairs, it has aroused unanimous sympathy from the entire faculty, students, and alumni. The movement to improve school affairs is expanding daily. The following records yesterday's news:</p>
<p>(1) Six Hundred Students, Including Xu Zicheng, Make Demands. Yesterday, more than six hundred students, including Xu Zicheng, addressed a letter to the school president, continuing the spirit of Tu Juyiao, putting forward eighteen demands: (1) Immediately determine a school operating plan; (2) Reduce all economic burdens on students, such as donation fees and experiment fees, which should be immediately waived. Tuition and dormitory fees should be appropriately reduced; (3) Improve classrooms and student dormitories to emphasize hygiene; (4) Thoroughly investigate corrupt and despicable elements such as Zhang Wei; (5) Thoroughly investigate the nationalistic faction led by Zou Bingwen and the reorganization faction led by Lin Qun, to strictly enforce party-led education; (6) Reorganize the school affairs council to implement the spirit of professor-led school governance; (7) Appoint deans of each college as soon as possible; (8) Hire more full-time professors, emphasize talent selection, and increase compensation; (9) Maximize acceptance of public opinion; (10) Rectify the publication enterprise to demonstrate Central University's spirit of academic pursuit; (11) Determine independent funding for each college; (12) Reduce all administrative expenses; (13) Increase funding for books; (14) Publicize the budget and final accounts, implementing open finances; (15) Implement an academic scholarship system; (16) Increase compensation for student service in the headquarters; (17) Encourage teacher-student cooperation; (18) Promote academic studies and establish research institutes.</p>
<p>(2) The Alumni Association Unanimously Supports. The alumni associations of National Southeastern University, National Ginling University, and National Central University held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at Central University at 8 PM yesterday (the 20th). In addition to the full attendance of the executive and supervisory committee members, several alumni such as Zhou Houxu attended. Chairman Jiang Jiaxiang resolved that, out of love for their alma mater, they unanimously supported the on-campus students' movement to improve school affairs and selected Jiang Jiaxiang, Yu Xilai, Chen Xiexun, Chen Shizhen, and Peng Baichuan to draft a letter to the president in accordance with the main points of today's resolution.</p>
<p>(3) The School Changes its Administrative Organization. The school's administrative organization, which operates under the president and is divided into three departments: secretary, academic affairs, and general affairs, costing 300,000 yuan annually, is one of the focal points of student criticism. The school authorities, having accepted the students' suggestions for improvement, decided to abolish the three departments of secretary, academic affairs, and general affairs, and reorganize them into a general affairs office, headed by Chief of Academic Affairs Huang Pu Huan. The General Affairs Office is divided into five sections: registration, documentation, publication, accounting, and general services. The original editorial matters are incorporated into the publication section, and construction projects are incorporated into the general services section.</p>
<p>(4) The President Prohibits Anonymous Posters. Recently, students at the school, citing poor school affairs, put forward several suggestions for improvement and submitted them to the president for adoption, while simultaneously issuing a publicity outline to draw the attention of all students. In addition, some students took this opportunity to post anonymous notices and leaflets everywhere, arbitrarily attacking all inappropriate measures taken by the school. President Zhang Naiyan therefore issued a proclamation strictly prohibiting such actions in order to maintain school discipline.</p>
<p>(5) Zhang Zuoshi Forced to Leave the School. Secretary-General Zhang Zuoshi, opposed by the students, hastily left the school yesterday to return to Hangzhou. President Zhang Naiyan has retained the accounting director Dai Chongen and general affairs director Shao Cong, in order to avoid a shutdown of school affairs.</p>
<h3>Overview of Education in Dongtai County</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Office for Joint Preparation of Compulsory Education recently reported the results of a survey on the status of education in Dongtai County. An abstract of the original text is recorded below: Dongtai County has suffered consecutive years of famine in the past two years. Fortunately, the efforts of educational administrative personnel have kept the arrears to a minimum. Now, Director Xu Yipeng is determined to rectify the situation, and the budget for this year has already been established, with the addition of 19 urban and rural schools. Social education has also been promoted, and recent attention has been paid to recovering temple and school properties to serve as the foundation for the future development of education throughout the county. It has been found that the temple and school properties total more than 28,000 mu, located over 100 li northeast of the county seat. Originally, they were the wasteland of the Temple of Literature and community schools, but were later occupied by the Tong Sui Company. Various local public organizations believe that these properties belong to education, and according to precise information, they have separately requested the provincial government to recover the property rights. Recently, after a provincial government meeting, the county was ordered to safeguard the total rent and grain, awaiting resolution. If fully recovered, the cotton income from last year amounts to more than 180,000 yuan, calculated at 9 yuan per mu, which will be of great importance to the future development of education in the county. (1) Regarding the income of expenses for the 19th year, the regular items such as surtaxes and collected installments amounted to 65,636 yuan, miscellaneous taxes and surtaxes amounted to 11,260 yuan, special donations amounted to 5,793 yuan, miscellaneous donations amounted to 111,902 yuan, property funds amounted to 40,824 yuan, and tuition and lodging fees amounted to 7,872 yuan. Temporary items such as field and house mortgages amounted to 50 yuan, totaling 148,287 yuan. Regarding expenditures, educational administrative fees amounted to 11,595 yuan, general education expenses amounted to 26,536 yuan, vocational education expenses amounted to 56,402 yuan, social education expenses amounted to 22,200 yuan, special income amounted to 5,850 yuan, and special expenses were the same. The first reserve fund was 7,295 yuan, and the second reserve fund was 21,870 yuan. This is a rough outline of income and expenditure. Regarding the safekeeping of funds, in addition to the bureau's own income, a temporary management committee is established for the educational funds of each city and township, with the local educational committee member serving as an ex officio member and an additional three to five members appointed. Their duties are: 1. To manage the educational base property fund of the city or township; 2. To collect all educational funds; 3. To distribute funds according to the budget of the Education Bureau; 4. To raise educational funds; 5. To supervise the collection of educational funds levied by the authorities. Since the implementation of this system, the benefits have been clear: 1. The principals of each city and township thoroughly understand the contents of educational expenses; 2. The expenses of each rural school are distributed by the educational committee of each district, sparing each school the trouble of going to the bureau to receive funds; 3. The educational base property fund is easier to manage in districts and can avoid corruption; 4. When educational expenses are difficult, each district raises its own funds, which are smaller in amount and easier to handle; 5. The principals of each city and township, because of their own relationship with the city and township's educational expenses, can assist in the safekeeping and fundraising of property. Therefore, even after two years of rare famine, Dongtai County has accumulated little in arrears in education expenses, and even when there are arrears, each school has been genuinely forgiven, resulting in very few disputes. Since the 16th year of the Republic, the educational expenses of various counties have been centralized in succession to seek uniformity, but the actual difficulties are still numerous. Now, Dongtai County has adopted a district-based management method for educational expenses, which, although slightly different from other counties, does not hinder its implementation and has yielded results. This is truly a research material for those who pay attention to local educational funding. (2) Compulsory education is divided into six school districts throughout the county, with a population of 1,136,142 people. There are a total of 110 public and private primary schools with 183 grades. A total of 6,876 school-age children have been enrolled, and 181,544 have not been enrolled. The county high school's rural normal department is the old site of the former Muli Normal School. The school buildings are in good condition, and running a rural normal school is especially appropriate. The county's teachers are comprised of 8,000 normal school students, 36 graduates of A-level normal schools, 12 graduates of three-year normal schools, 1 graduate of four-year normal schools, 1 kindergarten teacher, 4 post-secondary and high school teachers, and 70 unqualified teachers. The teacher resources seem to be lacking. Each district has set up a rural experimental primary school. If the gains from the experiment can become the center of education in a village, the results will be significant. There are 14 private primary schools in each school district. At a time when educational funds are stretched, the gradual increase in private primary schools is not necessarily a major boost. The current distribution of compulsory education funds allocates 7,800 yuan for reorganizing old undertakings, 16,000 yuan for new undertakings, and 2,576 yuan for accumulated funds. With the vast territory of the county and the large number of out-of-school children, increasing fundraising and promotion cannot be delayed. (3) General education in the city includes a county-run junior high school with 120 students in three grades and a budget of 5,500 yuan (with an attached rural normal course of one grade with 40 students and a budget of 2,000 yuan, plus 1,200 yuan for food).</p>
<p>Principal Liu Peiyuan has a total of 16 faculty and staff. There are a total of 24 complete primary schools (including 5 private schools), with 33 grades and the number of students is highest in Pingcha Primary School. Experimental primary schools and girls' primary schools also have more than 300 students. Pengcha City has a private junior high school. (4) Social education has progressed rapidly in recent years thanks to the efforts of Director Xu and Wang Xintian, head of the social education section. A public education center has been established in each of the urban areas of Pengcha and Shiyan, and a farmers' education center has been established in Xixi. Nineteen public schools are specially run, each with 40 yuan per term. An experimental public education area has also been established in the city, with three grades of adult, women, and kindergarten public schools with many students. Other facilities such as reading rooms and specially contracted public tea gardens have also been established one after another. Recently, an experimental mobile public school has been planned, and government agencies below the county government have also organized the Dongtai County Government Directly Subordinate Agencies Public School Promotion Committee. The public schools that should be established by each agency can open soon (remainder omitted).</p>

<h3>Shanghai Middle School Experimental Elementary School Exhibits Teachers' Achievements</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Experimental Elementary School on Shangwen Road has been reorganized for three years since 1927. During normal times, it has spared no effort in experimenting with and researching new education.

Today (the 22nd) is the anniversary of the school's reorganization. A joint commemorative ceremony was held with Shanghai Middle School in the morning. In the afternoon, achievements were exhibited at the school and a recreational assembly was held. It is reported that the achievements on display are mostly teachers' works, divided into four rooms: administration, teaching, research, and cultivation. Administrative achievements are divided into plans, regulations, and forms. Teaching achievements are divided into methods, materials, and equipment. Research achievements are divided into published and unpublished works. Cultivation achievements are divided into party ideology research, reading reports, and leisure life.

<h3>Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts Organizes Alumni Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is the first art school in China, and it has been nineteen years since its founding. The president is Liu Haisu, and over the years, there have been five to six thousand alumni. Most of those currently engaged in art in society, those who have founded art schools in various provinces and counties, those who hold art positions in secondary schools in various provinces and counties, and those who study art in France and Japan are alumni of the school. However, there has long been a lack of liaison organizations, which has prevented the concentration of efforts. Recently, Acting President Wang Yuanbo and Dean of Academic Affairs Ding Yuan of the school, in view of this, have initiated the Alumni Association and are actively proceeding. It is reported that the first preparatory committee meeting is scheduled to be held today, and the founding congress is planned to be held in late November on the school's anniversary.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Art College Travels to West Lake</h3>

Recently, the new campus has been completed and famous professors such as Chen Baoyi, Chen Zhibu, Ni Huayi, Shu Zhen, Wulanman, Li Cuizhen, Wu Bochao, Ye Qiuyuan, and Liu Banzhu have been hired, who are also extremely popular with students. Because the graduation date of the Class A students of the three-year Western Medicine Department is approaching, professors Chen Baoyi, Ni Huayi, and others are leading a study tour to West Lake with approximately 40 male and female students. They departed on the 20th and will spend approximately three weeks there. It is reported that the school president, Wang Daoyuan, will also go to guide them in the coming days.</p>

<h3>National Games Open in Japan</h3>
<p>The 17th National Games will be held on the 25th of this month. In preparation for participating in the World Games in two years, Japan is intensifying its track and field competitions. All competition rules are in accordance with the Olympic system. Low hurdles have been changed to 400 meters, medium hurdles, and the shot put has been changed to 16 pounds, with the addition of a weight throw. Because the players participating in the European Games have all returned to the country, it has been decided to hold the 17th National Games in Osaka on the 25th and 26th of this month to select new talent and encourage future generations to compete internationally throughout the year. After the completion of this conference, the Meiji Jingu Sports Tournament will be held in Tokyo. It is also one of the National Games of Japan, and its scope is larger than the ordinary one. In addition to the eight championships, there will also be equestrian, rowing, anndao, martial arts, boxing, sumo wrestling, gymnastics, and other events. In addition to students and citizens, all military camps and police stations must participate. Japan holds an average of three or four national games each year. Before the Far Eastern Games this year, the 17th Games were held once. The opening of this tournament is also imminent. Japan will also send players to participate in the China-Japan Joint Games in November this year. This conference is sponsored by the Kwantung Government and sponsored by Director Zhang. It is held alternately in Dalian and Lushun every year. However, because the Japanese underestimate the level of track and field in our country, I am afraid that they will not send first-class players to participate at that time. Japan is preparing for the above-mentioned major conferences, so pre-selection competitions are being held in the country. The Kinki pre-selection competition was completed in the past two days. Kinki includes Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Nara, Wakayama, and other counties.</p>

Details of various regulations and methods were issued to each school by the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday. The sports events are generally the same as in the previous games, but in the track and field competition, the girls' basketball throw has been changed to a baseball throw. The baseball throw rules set by the association are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Ball Used: The ball used in the competition shall be a standard 12-inch circumference indoor baseball. 2. Throwing Line: A wooden board at least 7 centimeters (4 and ¾ inches) wide and 3.66 meters (12 feet) long shall be buried flat in the ground. The inner edge of this board shall be the throwing line. 3. Throwing Method: When throwing the baseball, the player must hold the ball with one hand behind the throwing line and throw it forward from behind the shoulder. The action is the same as the outfield baseball throw. 4. Foul: Either of the following two situations in the competition shall be deemed as a failed throw without the need for measurement: (A) Violation of Article 3; (B) During the throw, any part of the body or clothing touches the throwing line or the ground outside the line before the ball lands. 5. Number of Attempts: Each competitor throws three times and the scores of the top six players are used. They may then throw three more times, using the longest of these as the competition score. 6. Error: A fault line is drawn one meter from the throwing line. A competitor stepping out or running past this line without throwing will be counted as an error. Two errors count as one failed attempt. If the player throws the ball without running, 7. Measurement: The measurement of the baseball is done with a right angle measuring from the nearest point where the baseball lands to the throwing line or its extended line.</p>

<h3>Results of the Nanjing Citywide Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>The Nanjing Citywide Tennis Tournament, organized by the Jiangsu Provincial Nanjing Public Sports Ground, was divided into six groups. It began on September 28th and concluded on the 17th of this month, spanning two weeks. Participants included not only school students but also many members of society, such as the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of [illegible], the Construction Committee, and the Waterworks, a good sign of Nanjing's social sports in recent years. During the matches, there were often hundreds or thousands of spectators. The past two weeks have been especially lively. Wang Qinghe won the Open Singles title, Yu Zhizhong won the Social Singles title, and Mao Yuwen won the Women's Singles title.

<h3>Song Ziwen and Meyer Departed for Guangdong Together Yesterday</h3>
<p>Song Returns to Shanghai Before the Fourth Plenary Session</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, accompanied by his secretary Tang Hai'an and two guards, took the Canadian Empress to Hong Kong at 6:00 AM yesterday morning and then went to Guangzhou and other places to inspect the financial situation of Guangdong Province, so as to make plans for future overall reorganization. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai before the Fourth Plenary Session. Also on the same ship to Hong Kong was Chief Inspector of Customs Meyer, whose task is to discuss anti-smuggling and tax collection matters with the Hong Kong government.</p>
<h3>National Calendar Year-End Accounting</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau Does Not Allow Flexibility</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Trade Association and the Rice Milling Trade Association, citing the difficulty in complying with the national calendar year-end accounting at the end of May and September, have twice petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting a temporary change in the year-end accounting period. The Bureau has now issued a response rejecting the request. The Bureau's response is transcribed below: The petition has been noted. The revision of the national calendar accounting date and the phased completion were decided after soliciting the opinions of the business community and careful consideration. It has been approved by the National Government and promulgated throughout the country for unified compliance. It has also been implemented by the Shanghai Municipal Government's Announcement No. 107. Last year, the national calendar year-end was pressing, and merchants were not prepared to settle accounts, so a temporary extension was granted. However, starting from 1930, absolute compliance should be observed, and no excuses should be made. Upon inspection, the petition states that the year-end accounting coincides with the time when new goods are on the market and funds are needed to accumulate grain, resulting in tight capital turnover. Without rice on the market next year, and with financial stagnation leading to grain stagnation, farmers and rice dealers will suffer. It is argued that the national calendar year-end accounting method is extremely difficult to comply with. In fact, the harvest of agricultural products, according to the solar terms, means that the late rice is ripe at the latest around the Frost's Descent solar term, and the harvest is completed. There are still two months until the year-end accounting, and farmers have plenty of time to sell rice. Moreover, the accounting and New Year's holidays are at most half a month, and a short-term stoppage should not cause inconvenience. The argument that financial stagnation leads to grain stagnation is illogical. It is likely that the association is afraid of reform and has made this request. It should be known that the difference between the national calendar and the lunar calendar is only two solar terms, with leap years being an exception. Now, the government is promoting the national calendar, and the people should also eliminate the habit of complacency and strive to comply. There is no such thing as a trial run, let alone a question of political tutelage or constitutional government. The Bureau supervises and enforces compliance and will not allow the industry to be an exception. The request to set February 15, 1931, as the year-end closing date is difficult to approve. You are hereby notified. This response.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chinese Steamship Companies to Fully Resume Operations</h3>
<p>Total Number of Chinese Steamships in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Central Government's suppression of the rebellion, Chinese steamship companies in Shanghai have suspended operations for two years. During this military period, foreign steamship companies have been very active in the Yangtze River and North-South Seas routes. Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and Kawasaki have been competing fiercely. Now that the Central Government's suppression of the rebellion has come to an end, the chartering of merchant ships should also come to an end. Recently, the Transportation Department of the General Headquarters has returned eight chartered ships to various steamship companies, which were used to transport the triumphant army to Jiangxi and Anhui provinces. The chartering of ships will be completely over soon. From November onwards, the Chinese steamship companies in Shanghai that have been suspended for a long time are expected to fully resume operations. The preparations for resuming operations and expanding routes of Chinese steamship companies, as well as the current tonnage of all steamships in Shanghai, are detailed below. This is also a major opportunity for the continuation of Chinese shipping.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Zhongwei New Steamship Company</p>
<p>Regarding China's recovery of shipping rights, British shipping merchants in Shanghai have stated that if the tonnage of Chinese steamships can meet the needs of commercial transportation, foreign merchant ships will automatically abandon various routes in China. Now, Chinese shipping merchants Chen Shuntong and Zhang Shusheng, in order to develop the national shipping industry, have raised 400,000 yuan to organize a new steamship company called Zhongwei. First, 100,000 yuan was used to purchase a steamship named Taiping, with a capacity of 4,000 tons. The head office has been established on Sichuan Road and Fuzhou Road and has already started operations, dispatching ships to the Haizhou area. Next spring, it is planned to purchase another ship to operate on the North-South Seas ports.</p>
<p>Request for Relief for the Shipping Industry</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, the owner of the Sanbei Company in Shanghai, submitted a request to the Central Government, stating that Chinese steamships have suffered huge losses during the military period. Now that the war is over, various companies urgently need relief. In addition to organizing a shipping bank to issue 10 million yuan in shipping bonds, it is also requested that the General Headquarters provide a subsidy of 1,000 yuan per month for each chartered merchant ship to compensate for the losses of long-term suspension of operations and to cover the increased hidden losses of various ships. This request has already been submitted.</p>
<p>Survey of Chinese Steamships in Shanghai</p>
<p>There are still 18 Chinese steamships in Shanghai that are currently suspended. It is expected that all of them will be able to resume operations within a week. Various steamship companies in Shanghai are already planning to resume operations. The number of Chinese steamships in Shanghai is something that the commercial transport industry urgently wants to know. The details are as follows:</p>

<h3>Order to Prohibit Enlistment</h3>
<p>Supplementary Troops Still Needed for the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received a telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating that the Shanghai County Government had reviewed the case and received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang, stating that the military operations to suppress the rebellion are about to end, and enlistment should be stopped immediately. All military personnel who have been sent to various districts to enlist troops should immediately comply with the order to withdraw. Local governments in various provinces should uniformly prohibit enlistment by various armies. If anyone violates the order and enlists troops without authorization, the local government should strictly arrest them and investigate them. In addition to sending telegrams separately, the Provincial Government should be followed.</p>

<h3>Taikoo Pay Raise Case Can Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Contract to be Signed Today</p>
<p>After Yu Qiaqing and Chen Bogang acted as mediators in the foreign sailors' pay raise case, Taikoo Company agreed to increase sailors' salaries by four yuan starting in September, and another yuan in March next year. The sailors requested that the one yuan to be added next year also be added this year. The opinions of both parties are close. Yesterday, Taikoo Company sent a letter to the Sailors' Association, approving the sailors to send representatives to the company at 11:00 AM today to discuss the pay raise issue in order to sign a contract. The Sailors' Union has appointed branch instructor Wang Yongsheng. The general union has appointed English secretary Zhao Shiming and Chinese secretary Liu Yuzhou to go to Taikoo today to negotiate and demand that the one yuan for next year also be added at the same time. This matter can be resolved peacefully. As for Nissin, Jardine Matheson, etc., they will be handled separately.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Investigates Director Wang of Hankou</h3>
<p>Director Wang Hao of Hankou Dismissed for Misconduct and Investigated</p>
<p>Deputy Chief of Accounting Section Deng Xieyang Dismissed</p>
<p>Li Yunliang Appointed as Director of Hankou Bureau</p>
<p>Since Mr. Li Zhonggong took over the China Merchants Bureau, he has been striving to rectify the accumulated malpractices of various branches and ships, which have been criticized by the society for a long time. Mr. Li is now starting to conduct a thorough investigation in preparation for rectification. Yesterday, it was learned that Wang Hao, the director of the Hankou Branch, had taken advantage of his position and engaged in private misconduct while serving as the secretary-general during Cai's tenure. Mr. Li was extremely angry and immediately ordered his dismissal and investigation. In addition, Deng Xieyang, the deputy chief of the accounting section, was also dismissed at the same time for being negligent in the same case. Li Yunliang, the deputy chief of the business [illegible] section, was appointed as the director of the Hankou Branch. A reporter from Xin Sheng News believes that this matter is of great importance to the future of the bureau's rectification. The details are as follows: Wang Hao is very stubborn. Since taking office as the director of the Hankou Branch in 1928, he has often neglected the orders of the head office. Zhao [illegible] repeatedly wanted to replace him but failed. During Cai's tenure, Wang also served as the secretary-general of the head office, which was a great overstepping of his authority. According to the branch regulations, if the annual income exceeds the quota, an extra bonus can be drawn for distribution to the branch staff. However, the distribution must be approved by the head office. Although Wang repeatedly requested the issuance of extra bonuses for the Hankou Branch in 1928 and 1929, Zhao approved only one month's double salary because the overall business of the head office was very sluggish and the Hankou Branch's overdraft in 1928 exceeded the quota by a huge amount, which should be deducted according to regulations. Therefore, the appropriation of the above bonus was not allowed. This case was delayed for two years. When Wang served as the secretary-general, he thought he could take the opportunity to seek approval and obtain tens of thousands of yuan. On the day before the current director Li Zhonggong took office, he hastily drafted a report without obtaining Cai's approval and ordered Deng Xieyang, the deputy chief of the accounting section, to transfer the money and cancel the registration, and also filled in the date and month on the original report and correspondence books to cover up the matter. The transfer voucher was filled in with the date of Li's assumption of office, which was September 13 (Saturday). Mr. Li performed the inauguration ceremony in the morning. In fact, the bureau staff had no time to work. The afternoon was the usual closing time (the bureau usually does not work on Saturday afternoons). No one was responsible, so Wang took advantage of the chaos to rob. Unexpectedly, this act of taking advantage of his position for private gain was reported, and Mr. Li ordered a strict investigation. After the evidence was confirmed, he ordered his dismissal and investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Waterworks Company Agrees to Prepare Balance Sheet</h3>
<p>Reply to Taxpayers' Association Letter</p>
<p>The Shanghai Waterworks Company replied to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday regarding the audit matter, stating: "In response to your association's letter of the 8th of this month, requesting that the company's profit and loss statement and balance sheet for January 1 to June 30, 1930, be submitted to your association's representatives for review, this company has already submitted for review by your association's representatives the 1930 expenditure statement and profit and loss statement prepared by this company based on the actual figures for the first half of this year. As for the accounts for the first half of this year, the company's chief accountant unfortunately passed away in February, and the successor took over for only one week, so it has not been fully prepared yet. Moreover, the company has only been settling accounts every six months in recent years for the reference of the directors and not for the review of the shareholders. Whether the semi-annual balance sheet should be prepared this year is still a question. However, if your association's representatives are determined to review the figures, this company will certainly do its best to prepare them immediately, but it may take three or four weeks to complete them." This reply is hereby given.</p>
<h3>Labor Arbitration Ordinance Canceled</h3>
<p>Future Disputes Can Be Handled by Law</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau issued an order to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "In order to comply with the order, the case concerns the Municipal Government's Order No. 6026, which includes the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Order No. 1585 regarding the transmission of information. The case concerns the previous approval of the Anhui Provincial Government's Order No. 390 regarding whether the 'Measures for Handling Labor Disputes' can be interpreted and handled by referring to the 'Labor Dispute Handling Law' before its promulgation. The 'Labor Dispute Handling Law' is a special law, and labor dispute cases cannot be used by analogy. However, the 'Labor Arbitration Council Ordinance,' promulgated in August 1926, was originally established to resolve disputes between workers at that time. It is now being questioned whether it is still applicable. The Executive Yuan and the Judicial Yuan have been consulted for interpretation, and the Ministry has also first consulted the Anhui Provincial Government for reference. It has been replied that the content of the 'Labor Arbitration Council Ordinance' is largely incompatible with the current administrative system, and labor dispute cases can be handled by applying general laws. It seems that the ordinance can be explicitly abolished or amended and supplemented separately. The Executive Yuan has been consulted for review by the Legislative Yuan. Now, the Executive Yuan's Order No. 3483 states: 'The case concerns the notification of the matter. The Ministry has previously submitted that the content of the "Labor Arbitration Council Ordinance" is largely incompatible with the current administrative system, and labor dispute cases can be handled by applying general laws. If the ordinance should still be implemented as before, it should also be amended and supplemented separately with opinions and submitted for review and transmission to the Legislative Yuan.' A copy of the 'Labor Arbitration Council Ordinance,' promulgated on August 16, 1926, was submitted to the court. After reviewing the situation and copying the ordinance, it was transmitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. In response to the notice, the Legislative Yuan's Order No. 97 states: 'The case concerns the Executive Yuan's Order No. 187, based on the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's request to explicitly abolish the "Labor Arbitration Council Ordinance" or amend and supplement it separately, please review it.' At the 106th meeting of the court on August 23, 1930, it was decided to submit it to the Labor Law Drafting Committee for review. According to the review report, it was stated that: 'The members met on September 12 to discuss the matter together and agreed that the ordinance was originally established to resolve disputes between workers at that time. Now, disputes between workers are relatively less common than in previous years. If such disputes occur, administrative agencies can apply general laws to handle them as appropriate, and there is no need to establish separate ordinances. Moreover, the content of the ordinance is largely incompatible with the current situation. It seems that it can be submitted to the National Government for explicit abolition and need not be amended or supplemented.' It was requested to submit it to the General Assembly for a public decision. At the 110th meeting of the court on September 20, 1930, it was decided to adopt the review report. In addition to requesting the National Government to explicitly abolish the 'Labor Arbitration Council Ordinance,' the corresponding record was consulted for reference." This order was issued, and the Ministry was ordered to notify the chamber to follow the order and instruct all subordinate commercial organizations to be informed.</p>

<h3>Important Cases Decided by the Food Committee</h3>
<p>Discussing Issues of Maintaining Farmers' Economy and Sufficiency of People's Food</p>
<p>The Municipal Food Committee held its 19th regular meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau on the 18th. More than ten experts, committee members, and leaders of the rice industry attended the meeting. Committee member Feng Liutang proposed seven measures to maintain the farmers' economy and ensure the sufficiency of people's food. Committee member Zhu Yinong proposed levying a surtax on food imports. After joint discussion, it was decided that: (1) It is recommended to levy import taxes on major food grains to fund agricultural improvement and the Central Disaster Relief Fund; (2) It is requested that the Central Government issue an order to all provinces and cities to prepare statistics on the amount of rice and grain harvested in each place this year and the amount consumed in previous years within three months, so that the Central Government can establish a grain regulation policy and order all provinces and cities to comply; (3) All provinces, cities, and counties should uniformly restore warehouses starting this year and store three months' worth of grain according to the size of their population. If there is less, they must apply to the higher-level government for approval. The method of raising funds should be determined by each locality; (4) The import of Japanese rice should be investigated immediately to determine the amount already imported. It is requested that the Central Government promptly determine the method, and those that have not yet been shipped should be prohibited from importing; (5) Members of the Food Industry Committee of this committee should investigate the amount of harvest in various production areas. Those in Jiangsu and Zhejiang must report to the committee within two weeks, and those in Hunan and Jiangxi must report to the committee within four weeks for reference; (6) Those merchants and businessmen in this city who store more than 5,000 piculs of grain and operate in accordance with the city's regulations on public storage of rice and grain shall be commended by the government.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Prohibits Watered Rice</h3>
<p>The bad habit of watering rice in the Southern Gang rice industry in this city undermines commercial ethics and harms the health of citizens. The Social Affairs Bureau has issued two announcements strictly prohibiting it and has sent personnel to secretly investigate at any time. It has been found that most places such as Wujiang Tongli in the Southern Gang have complied, but rice from Shengze is still watered. Yesterday, rice merchants Yan Xiaoquan and others were strictly ordered to investigate and report, and the bad habit of watering rice must be completely eradicated by the end of the year. If it is found after the deadline, the ships and goods will be confiscated to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhuzun Telephones to Persuade Huang, Li, and Bai to Ceasefire</h3>
<p>The military affairs in the north are gradually coming to an end, but Huang, Li, and Bai in Guangxi Province are still stubbornly resisting, and the Cantonese army's siege of Yong and Liu is becoming more and more fierce, and the people of Guangxi are suffering greatly. They desperately want a third party to come forward and advocate peace. Recently, many people from Guangxi Province who traveled to Shanghai discussed asking Mr. Chen Zhuzun, a member of the education circle in the province, to come forward and advocate it. The following is a transcript of his conversation: [illegible] Our province has suffered from war for more than a year, and the air force has destroyed it. The people are displaced and have nowhere to go. If they don't die in the war, they die from thieves. If they don't die from thieves, they die from hunger. Huang, Li, and Bai cannot advance or retreat, and they are only ruining the area and sacrificing the people. The people of the entire province are suffering. We plan to ask you to come forward and promote peace to speed up Huang, Li, and Bai's realization and cease the war as soon as possible to save the people of Guangxi from fire and water, and to ask the Cantonese army to stop attacking immediately in order to seek permanent peace in Guangdong and Guangxi. It is very urgent. (Answer) I have always been in the education circle and do not ask about politics, and I have no effect. Why bother with this? After repeated requests from the fellow villagers, Mr. Chen has agreed to call Huang, Bai, and Li to cease the war immediately.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Municipal Government from Chinese Property Owners Regarding Rent Collection</h3>
<p>Rent Collection Should Be Limited to One Month</p>
<p>Pan Peide and others, Chinese property owners in this city, have submitted a petition to the Municipal Government regarding the collection of rents, stating that the total monthly rent income in the Chinese-administered area of this city is indeed one million yuan. As such, in the matter of raising funds for customs bonds through rent collection, please change the period from two months to one month to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses. Upon investigation, your office has been ordered to raise one million yuan in short-term customs bonds for the 19th year of the Republic. A public notice has already been issued to collect two months' worth of rent. The property owners believe that the total rent income for two months in the Chinese-administered area of this city exceeds two million yuan, which is more than double the amount allocated by the central government. This is an unbearable burden. On the eighth of this month, they jointly submitted a petition to your office, requesting a flexible approach to collect only one million yuan, and to publicly announce the amount of rent received at any time to demonstrate transparency and alleviate the people's difficulties. The deadline is approaching, but no instructions have been received yet. The property owners are at a loss and do not know what to do. They believe that the total monthly rent income in the Chinese-administered area does indeed exceed one million yuan. They hereby request to prove this amount with the following facts: (1) In the 16th year of the Republic, two months' rent was collected in this city's Chinese-administered area as a patriotic donation, totaling approximately 2.5 million yuan. Old donation records are available for verification, which proves that the total monthly rent in the Chinese-administered area of this city should be around 1.25 million yuan. (2) Furthermore, the 17th-year business report published by the city's Finance Bureau states that the annual rent tax collected in this city is 1.3 million yuan. It is an undeniable fact that there are more residential properties than commercial properties in the Chinese-administered area of this city. If we assume that residential properties account for 60% and commercial properties account for 40%, then out of the 1.3 million yuan, 780,000 yuan is collected from residential properties and 520,000 yuan is collected from commercial properties. The rent tax rate for residential properties is calculated at 14% of the rent. The total annual rent income for commercial properties should be 3.7 million yuan. The total annual rent for residential and commercial properties is 11.5 million yuan, with a monthly average of 960,000 yuan. This is the bare minimum. (3) In fact, the total monthly rent income in this city is definitely more than 960,000 yuan. Although the rent tax in Zhabei is calculated at 100% of the rent amount, the rent tax in Hujiang is first reduced to 75% of the rent and then calculated at 10% or 14%. It is an undeniable fact that Zhabei is far more prosperous than Hujiang, so the total rent is less in Zhabei than in Hujiang. If we assume that Zhabei accounts for 40% and Hujiang accounts for 60%, then out of the 960,000 yuan in monthly rent, only 380,000 yuan belongs to Zhabei, and 580,000 yuan belongs to Hujiang. This 580,000 yuan is calculated based on the proportion of rent tax collected, and the actual rent in Hujiang is reduced by 25%. Therefore, we should add one-third of the original amount to the 580,000 yuan, which is 190,000 yuan, for a total of 770,000 yuan, which is the actual monthly rent collected in Hujiang. Adding the 380,000 yuan from Zhabei, the total monthly rent in the Chinese-administered area of the city is actually 1.15 million yuan. (4) Furthermore, according to the rules for collecting rent tax in this city, rent tax for charitable organizations and schools is usually exempted or reduced. However, this time, rent is collected across the board. Therefore, the actual monthly rent in this city is more than 1.15 million yuan. (5) The above calculations are based on the rent tax collected in the 17th year of the Republic. However, in recent years, the rent has increased considerably due to the reconstruction of old houses and the construction of new houses in the Chinese-administered area. Therefore, the current monthly rent is more than 1.15 million yuan. (6) It is said that your office exempts property owners with a monthly rent of less than three yuan from collecting rent. However, it can be said that there are very few property owners in this city with a monthly rent of less than three yuan. It is impossible to use this as an excuse to say that the monthly rent collected in this city is less than one million yuan. Based on the above facts, it can be said with certainty that the monthly rent in the Chinese-administered area of this city is more than one million yuan. Since your office has been ordered to raise customs bonds limited to one million yuan, collecting rent for one month is more than sufficient. Why collect rent for two months, exceeding the amount by more than double, causing many difficulties for property owners due to financial turnover issues? If you say that the amount that should be collected according to the above figures cannot be regarded as the actual amount collected, then your office is using a public notice approach, which is mandatory. With the credibility of your office, coupled with the assistance of the military and police to pay rent on behalf of tenants, the strength of your collection power is far greater than the usual rent collection situation of property owners. There is no reason why the monthly amount of more than one million yuan cannot be collected in full. The property owners have repeatedly considered that it is difficult to bear the burden of doubling the borrowing. For this reason, they respectfully request that your office quickly change the borrowing period to one month, so that the collection will stop as soon as the amount is met. The gratitude for your kindness will be boundless. This petition is respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3>Military Department Sends Commissioners to Investigate Barracks Property in Songhu</h3>
<p>It has recently been reported to the Qingli Yingchan Chu (Barracks Property Clearance Office) of the Ministry of Military Affairs that the two buildings rented by the headquarters of the First Anti-Smuggling Brigade of the Wusong West Town Outer Bund and the office of the Wusong Inspection Bureau are barracks property. The Ministry of Military Affairs has dispatched Hu Qinzi Shilo, the director of the First Investigation District, to the Wusong Fortified Taiwan Fortress Command to investigate. A letter has also been sent to the First Anti-Smuggling Brigade, requesting them to invite the landlord, Ye Fubao, to bring the deed to the command for inspection and verification. According to local elders, the two old-fashioned "One Seal" buildings were built in the middle of the Guangxu period of the previous Qing Dynasty (around the 25th or 26th year) by Ban Fuzhai, the commander of the land army defending Wusong. After completion, one building was occupied by Ban's concubine, and the other was rented by the anti-smuggling camp. After Ban's death, the property was managed by his nephew (because Ban had no sons), Ban Pengjiu.</p>

<h3>Memorial Ceremony for Hui Youguang Held in Shanghai by Fellow Northwesterners</h3>
<p>Initiated by Yu Youren and Others</p>
<p>Time: 26th</p>
<p>Location: Jade Buddha Temple</p>
<p>Mr. Hui Youguang of Shaanxi has been striving for the revolution for more than 20 years. From the Xinhai Revolution to the Jingguo Army and the National Army, he has exhausted his planning efforts. In the 12th year of the Republic, when Fan Xingmin entered Guangdong to relieve the siege of Guangzhou, Mr. Hui was the main instigator. Mr. Hui's family property was entirely sacrificed for the revolution. The name of Mr. Hui is known to every woman and child in Guanzhong. He passed away at sea in the autumn of the 16th year of the Republic. In the 17th year, his family escorted his coffin back to his hometown and buried it this month. Recently, members of the Central Committee Yu Youren, Zhou Yaowu, Hu Yuheng, Yang Mingxuan, Ma Wenyan, and others initiated a public memorial ceremony. The notice is hereby published: We have recently received the news of the death of our friend Hui Youguang. It has been decided that he will be buried in his hometown of Qingjian on the 23rd of this month. We, his colleagues, recall Mr. Hui's revolutionary spirit and have decided to hold a public memorial ceremony at the Jade Buddha Temple at the intersection of Gordon Road and Binlang Road in the British Concession at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month (Sunday). We respectfully request your attendance at that time. If you have any elegies or other items, please send them to the temple in advance.</p>
<h3>US Restrictions on Egg Yolk Imports</h3>
<p>Foreign Trade to be Affected</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Cables Ministry to Request Negotiations</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing, stating: According to a letter from the Shanghai Egg Products Manufacturers Association on the 20th of October, the industry has long been shipping machine-made egg yolk (commonly known as "Flying Yellow") to Europe and the United States. Except for occasional cases where newly-established companies produced substandard products that rotted upon arrival overseas, resulting in rejection, there have been no restrictions. In recent years, the Americans have been meticulously planning to seize the profits from egg production from our country. They first vigorously advocated increasing taxes to seek to resist our products. When increasing taxes failed, they revised new regulations this year, limiting the acidity of imported Chinese Flying Yellow to five degrees. Any acidity exceeding this limit will be considered spoiled and rejected for import. The acidity of Flying Yellow is originally below this limit when it is freshly produced. However, the acidity increases with prolonged storage. Merchants sometimes store goods temporarily to wait for favorable prices when market prices are not suitable. This is a common commercial practice to seek speculative gains. If we are subject to this strict restriction, then once the goods are manufactured, they must be sold immediately, regardless of profit or loss. Perhaps, we would not even dare to start manufacturing without firm orders. Furthermore, the manufacture of this egg product is concentrated in egg-producing areas in the interior, and transactions occur in treaty ports open to both Chinese and foreigners. If there are unexpected delays during transportation at various stages, causing the acidity to exceed the limit, the goods will also be rejected. The bankruptcy of merchants will be imminent. The US restriction on acidity is a conspiracy to undermine our egg production industry. For this reason, we are forced to request your association to quickly telegraph the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to forward a telegram to the Chinese ambassador to the United States or directly to the US government to protest and urge them to abolish the new regulations and follow the previous practices. At the very least, they must agree to relax the acidity limit so that our egg factory industry can survive. We have checked that the sale of machine-made eggs from our country to Europe and the United States has been a long-standing practice, but US merchants are meticulously planning to undermine our industry. They first proposed to increase taxes to resist our products, and now they have revised new regulations, limiting the acidity of egg yolk to only five degrees, and rejecting imports if the limit is exceeded. Such excessive restrictions are intended to make Chinese egg yolk disappear. We must understand that the acidity of egg yolk is originally below this limit, but it exceeds this limit due to the time required for waiting for sales. This is a normal physical phenomenon. To rashly consider it spoiled and reject transportation would be tantamount to making our egg yolk unsalable from now on. With the intention of undermining our industry, we should fight for our rights based on reason to maintain our national industry. It is appropriate to telegraph your ministry to review and quickly forward it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request that it negotiate and stop the excessive limitations of the new regulations and follow the previous practices to maintain the egg industry for the public good. Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<h3>Changes in Party Members in Each District Must Be Reported at Any Time</h3>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Organization Department</p>
<p>The Organization Department of the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang yesterday issued a notice to the party headquarters and directly affiliated branches in each district of this city: In order to reorganize the roster of party members throughout the city for easy reference, the Registration Section of the 18th Department Affairs Meeting proposed to recompile the roster of party members in each district of the city. However, during the mutual comparison with the districts, it was found that the changes in party members were not reported at any time in accordance with the prescribed procedures, which hindered registration. Please instruct each district to report the party member transfer registration form, the transfer-in registration form, and the death registration form at any time in the future for registration and easy reference. The resolution was passed. It has been found that the number of party members in each district often does not match the statistics of this department, which is caused by the lack of attention to changes in party members. For this reason, the resolution is recorded and notified. In the future, the party member transfer registration form, the transfer-in registration form, and the death registration form must be filled out and reported at any time for registration so that the statistics on the number of party members will not be inconsistent due to each district acting on its own. Please comply with this requirement. This is of utmost importance and is hereby notified.</p>

<h3>Bandit Shot Dead on Datong Road Last Night</h3>
<p>Thieves Committed Robbery on North Chengdu Road</p>
<p>One Thief Carrying Loot Fled to Datong Road</p>
<p>Discovered by Detectives Who Opened Fire in Pursuit</p>
<p>Thief Shot and Immediately Died</p>
<p>At around 6:20 PM last night, a bandit was shot dead near Siwenli on Datong Road. This bandit had committed a robbery with accomplices at 1472 North Chengdu Road ten minutes before his death. Carrying the loot, he escaped on a No. 3 tram. He got off the tram at the Datong Road intersection and was spotted by detectives from the Xinzha Patrol Station, who stepped forward to search him. The bandit opened fire to resist arrest and was shot and killed on the spot. Both sides fired about twenty shots in total.</p>
<p>The robbery occurred at 1472 North Chengdu Road at around 6:10 PM last night. Three thieves, armed with weapons and speaking with a Shaoxing accent, broke into the house. The victim was unable to resist and was robbed of 98 yuan in cash and silver. The thieves escaped without a trace. The victim reported the incident to the patrol station for investigation. About ten minutes after the incident, Detective No. 275 and Chinese Constable No. 2525 from the Xinzha Patrol Station spotted a man wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants getting off a No. 3 tram on Datong Road in Xinzha. Suspecting his appearance, they decided that he was not a good person. The detectives ordered him to stop and stepped forward to search him.</p>
<p>Bandit Shot Dead. The man, seeing the detectives approaching, panicked and tried to flee north towards Datong Road. He took out a pistol from his pocket and fired two shots at the police. Detective No. 275 and Chinese Constable No. 2525 immediately returned fire. The bandit could not withstand the attack and fled to near Siwenli. He was hit in a vital spot by a bullet and immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. He died soon after. At the time, gunshots cracked and bullets flew, alarming the customers at the nearby Ruyiguan and Xinxingguan restaurants. After the gunshots stopped, passersby gathered around and saw that the dead bandit was about 27 or 28 years old. The bandit's pistol fell to the ground after he was shot. The police collected the pistol, and the body was taken away by the Xinzha Patrol Station's vehicle. The victim of the robbery identified the deceased as one of the bandits who committed the robbery. He still had some of the stolen silver in his pocket, which he had not used.</p>
<h3>Accused of Bigamy, Zhang Nai Appeared in Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Debate Between Both Sides Concluded</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the Afternoon of the 28th</p>
<p>Zhang Nai, accompanied by his lawyer, arrived in court yesterday. Zhang Nai, a technician at the Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory, was sued by his legal wife, You Yaha, along with Yang Xuejiu, principal of a school in the east of the city, Gong Yu, Yu Yang, and others, for bigamy. After several summonses by the Special District Court, Zhang Nai had failed to appear. Only yesterday, Zhang arrived in court with his lawyer, Chen Tingrui. The other defendants, Yang Xuejiu, Yang's mother Yang Zhou, Zhang's sister Gong Yu, and Zhang's mother Yu Zhang, also appeared in court to be questioned.</p>
<p>Because he inherited two family lines, he had two surnames. In court, he was first asked if Zhang Nai had another surname, and he answered yes. Both Yu and Zhang were his surnames, with Zhang being the inherited line. Previously, he lived in Shanghai and had just returned from Japan and was currently unemployed. His mother, Yu Zhang, was in Hangzhou. You Yaha has been his wife for seventeen years. Yang Xuejiu was married as part of the inherited line, with the wedding taking place on May 24th of this year. This matter was his father's dying wish. While his mother was pregnant with him, he was adopted by his maternal aunt. His aunt had no children and remained a widow, so he inherited her family line, thus becoming a Zhang. His brother, Yu Baoyuan, was also adopted by his paternal uncle.</p>
<p>I approve of the one-man, one-wife system. I cannot inherit the Zhang family line and cut off my family's ancestral line. Therefore, my father always wanted me to take a second wife. I personally did not approve. Although I wanted to practice one-man, one-wife with You, You was not virtuous, so I had to marry Yang. Therefore, I am responsible for the smaller issue, and You is responsible for the larger one. I previously told You to take care of herself, that I would never marry another woman, but You often showed signs of disgust and tried to make me suffer, so I married Yang.</p>
<p>Yaha could have prevented the marriage but did not. At the time, she knew about it. She could have prevented the marriage but did not. At the same time, she went out while I was busy working at the factory. All the trivial matters at home were expected of me, which made me feel very distressed. On March 11th, You left without saying a word. Later, I summoned her to return, but it was unsuccessful. You said that a wife is an outsider, so I had no one else to help me and had to find a way out, so I married Yang.</p>
<p>I once deceived Yang by saying that I had divorced You. I initially told Yang that I was divorced from You. Yang felt very sorry for me and was willing to be my lifelong companion. She had this intention before, but because I was already married, she did not reveal it. As for the things at my residence at 19 Zhiching Lane, Xujiahui, I ordered people to move them to Gong Yu's place. She treated me and You Yaha very well. She usually received a lot of help from me. Instead of appreciating her assistance, I accused her of theft, which I deeply regret. The wedding with Ms. Yang Xuejiu was held at Moore Memorial Church. My mother did not attend the wedding, and so on.</p>
<p>Yang's mother testified that she did not receive the express letter. Yang Zhou testified that she was unable to attend the wedding due to illness. After Zhang and Yang got married, they wanted to go to Japan, so they invited me to the photo studio for a group photo. The court asked if she had received an express letter from You Yaha on December 2nd of last year, to which she replied that she had not. Because at that time, I went to Beijing for school affairs to see Ye Chucang. I returned after seven days, and the letter was not seen.</p>
<p>A wedding at a hotel is not very solemn. Judge Cheng Shangfeng also summoned Pastor Yu Zhizhai of Moore Memorial Church as a witness, who testified that he was 55 years old and officiated the wedding. First, Zhang Nai came to me under the name of Yu Xuelou. I asked what the matter was. Zhang wanted to rent my place for the wedding. He said that he was a university graduate who had studied in the United States and was going to marry Ms. Yang Xuejiu, the principal of a school in the east of the city. Yang's sister was a student at Moore Memorial Church School. I asked why they did not get married at a hotel, implying that I was reluctant. Zhang said that a wedding at a hotel does not have the solemnity of a church. I agreed.</p>
<p>The couple did not commit any crime. When the wedding ceremony was about to begin, I said to the two hundred or so guests, "Ladies and gentlemen, the bride and groom are about to get married. If any of you know of any illegal acts committed by this couple, please speak up." Then I asked the bride and groom the same question, but they did not say anything. I knew that they had not committed any crime. Then I left, and I don't know what happened after that. What I have said is the truth.</p>
<p>Some days after the wedding, Zhang suddenly became unhappy. You Yaha testified that there were still a few simple things to say. Zhang Nai said that he inherited two family lines, but it was actually the Yu family line. He never mentioned before the wedding that he had been instructed to take a second wife. Before the wedding, Zhang also told me that he had no other girlfriends. Some days after the wedding, Zhang went out and returned looking depressed. I asked him, and Zhang replied that a friend had told him that he looked thin and seemed to be sick. I asked who the friend was, and Zhang replied Yang Xuejiu. However, at that time, our relationship was still good. Later, when my aunt arrived, there was a disagreement.</p>
<p>Zhang Nai is Napoleon II. On June 25th, Zhang wanted to throw his son into the Huangpu River, but I stopped him. That's when it ended. On July 23rd, Zhang came home from outside carrying a stone statue of Napoleon. He said that I was Napoleon II. After thinking about it again and again, I realized that Napoleon had divorced his first wife and married another woman. I told Zhang not to become Napoleon. Last November, Zhang attended the World Engineering Conference in Japan. When Zhang went to Japan, Yang Xuejiu personally went to the Huishan Wharf to see him off and gave him gifts.</p>
<p>Chen Tingrui requested an adjournment for reconciliation. The court, seeing that all the testimonies had been completed, ordered the commencement of arguments. Lawyer Chen Tingrui rose to say that he was requesting an adjournment for several days so that there could be room for reconciliation. Lawyer Li Zuyu, representing You Yaha, stated that if the defendant was willing to reconcile, they would not object, or if the court felt that the facts were clear and wanted to proceed with the arguments, they would also express their sympathy. Lawyer Jiang Yiping then said that Yang Xuejiu was in the most unfortunate position, and her suffering was shared by both Zhang and You. According to Yang's personal wishes, the trial should proceed, but for the sake of the entire case, it might be advisable to grant an adjournment to give Zhang and You a chance to reconcile so that there would be no flaws in the future and the families could be reunited, which would be somewhat comforting to Yang.</p>
<p>The debate between both sides was declared concluded. Judge Cheng, seeing that both sides had been delaying until now and had not reconciled, decided to begin the arguments. Then the plaintiff's lawyer, Yang Zuyu, and the defendants' lawyers, Chen Tingrui and Jiang Yiping, debated with each other. The court ordered the conclusion of the debate. Zhang Nai paid a bail of five thousand yuan, and Yang paid a bail to appear when summoned. The others still paid the original bail. The date was changed to the afternoon of the 28th of this month (next Tuesday) at 3:00 PM for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Russian Dancer Shot Three Times</h3>
<p>The Murderer Surrendered Himself to the Detective</p>
<p>Out of Hatred Because the Woman Loved Another</p>
<p>Astravalva, a Russian dancer aged nineteen, was intimately involved with George Ninya, named Batelizi. Batelizi is currently employed as a bodyguard for a Chinese person, formerly a wealthy merchant who once opened a dance hall in Harbin. At 6:15 PM on the 20th, the two met at a restaurant at 632 Avenue Joffre. After a few words, Batelizi drew a gun and shot the woman. The crowd heard the sound and went to rescue her. Batelizi fired another shot to stop them. Then, he fired three more shots, hitting the woman twice in the left leg and twice in the right leg. The Russian woman fell to the ground in a pool of blood, crying for help. At that time, a French detective happened to be passing by the door. Batelizi surrendered himself and handed over two guns, one of which was a Browning pistol with two bullets remaining. The Russian woman was sent to the hospital, where doctors used X-rays to find that the leg bones had been shattered, and she would no longer be able to work as a dancer even if she recovered in the future. According to Batelizi's confession at the police station, he had been living with the woman for several years. Recently, because he was poor, the woman fell in love with another man, so he angrily did this. It is said that the police station will send Batelizi to the French Concession Court in the coming days to be charged with murder.</p>
<h3>Cardsharps Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Wei Xiaohua's Wife Cried Loudly in Court</p>
<p>Saying That Her Eighty-Year-Old Mother Had No Means of Living</p>
<p>The master swindlers Wang Xianting, Huang Lushen, Pan Guozhong, Li Song, Wei Xiaohua, Xu Jinsheng, and others, who repeatedly used intimidation and fraud to open rooms in major hotels to set up gambling dens to swindle thousands of dollars from Xie Xiaxun, a famous chess player from Pingyang, and others, were arrested by Bao Detective Liang Chengyu of the Old North Gate Police Station one after another. About 25,000 yuan in ghost money and Eastern Province exchange certificates were seized and sent to the Special District Local Court.

The forty-eight ghost money and eleven Eastern Province exchange certificates were confiscated. After the judgment was announced, the defendants were taken away by the police to be executed separately. At that time, Ji, the wife of the defendant Wei Xiaohua, cried and made a fuss in the court. Judge Xu ordered bailiff Fei Congsheng to bring the woman to the court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station requested a ruling. Judge Xu asked the woman why she was making a noise in the court. According to her statement, her eighty-year-old mother relied on her husband for a living. Now that her husband was convicted and imprisoned, she felt extremely distressed, so she cried bitterly. Fan Gang, the agent of Wei Xiaohua, immediately requested the court to consider that the woman was ignorant and to leniently order her to return. Judge Xu declared to Ji that if she disagreed with the judgment, she could appeal according to the law and could not make unreasonable noise in the court. She should be punished, but considering her ignorance and that it was her first offense, she was ordered to return and not repeat such behavior. Ji agreed and left.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Death of Xin Dingchang</h3>
<p>The French Police Station Sent Detectives to Investigate</p>
<p>The Body Was Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>Xin Dingchang, a sampan man, was shot into the river by a French sailor for no reason on the evening of the 16th of this month, and tragically drowned. The details were published in the 18th issue of this newspaper. It is now learned that the body of the deceased has already floated up, but all sectors have been outraged by this incident. The Party Headquarters has also issued a declaration to the people of the country. The details of the case are as follows:</p>
<p>The truth of the incident is that Xin was thirty years old and from Ningbo. Since childhood, he learned rowing skills on the No. 110 sampan rowed by his father, Hesheng. Later, when he grew older and had considerable physical strength, his father bought a new sampan, registered as No. 130, and ordered his son to row it. Xin operated at the Widetoma Road pier in Yangshupu. On the evening of the 16th of this month, two sailors from the French Waldeck-Rousseau warship, which was docked in the Huangpu River, hired Xin's sampan to cross to the French cannon sand merchant ship (transliteration) docked in the center of the river to visit friends. They did not pay the fare and boarded the ship, asking Xin to wait for a while, as they still wanted to return to shore. After a long time, three sailors from the ship took Ge A Mao's chartered sampan ashore, and the two sailors also followed down, crossing Xin's sampan to Ge's sampan, intending to evade Xin's fare. Xin saw that the situation was not good and stopped the sailor in the back to ask for money. The sailor was unreasonable and started punching and kicking him on the spot. Xin did not expect that he would suddenly attack and was not prepared, so he was knocked into the river and drowned. This is the truth of what happened when the tragedy occurred. After the French soldier caused the accident, he did not try to rescue him and instead took another sampan and forcibly tried to go ashore. The sampan man was also unhappy with his unprovoked killing of people, so he gathered the neighboring boats to try to stop the soldier and hand him over to the water patrol police station for investigation. Seeing that the situation was not good, the soldier snatched the road ashore and disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>The police station investigated the matter and the deceased's father, Hesheng, learned that his son had died tragically, so he cried to the water patrol police station. Police chief Kaili reported the case and ordered West Detective Pang Shihua and Detective Deng Jiagen to board the ship for investigation. At the same time, Ge A Mao and Zhu Gensheng, two sampan men from No. 1156 and No. 795, also went to the police station and were willing to testify. The next day (17th) at 10:00 AM, Police Chief Pang of the police station and Detective Deng went to the French Consulate to meet with the French Deputy Consul to report the case. The Consul said that the case was related to the navy and asked Pang to visit the Chief Patrol Officer of the French Police Station. After mutual consultation, the police station sent one Chinese and one Western detective each to accompany Pang Deng back to the French ship for investigation at 2:00 PM. On the spot, they found three original sailors who had boarded the ship before and after the French soldier. The three sailors also confessed that they had witnessed the French soldier hitting Xin into the river. However, they did not pay attention to the appearance of the French soldier because it was too sudden, so they had forgotten. The detectives returned to the police station to report that they had not obtained any key information.</p>
<p>The attitude of the French Consulate was that on the morning of the 18th, the detectives visited the French Deputy Consul for the second time and requested that they be allowed to board the warship to investigate and identify the soldiers who caused the accident. The Consul said that he had to obtain the consent of the captain of the warship first and agreed to contact him on his behalf. At 1:00 PM, the water patrol police station suddenly received a phone call from the French Police Station saying that the French Consul had discussed the matter with the warship, but the captain said that he refused to allow them to board the ship. Because the murderer had not been found, the head of the water patrol police station believed that the case was difficult to solve, so he ordered detectives to go to the French Consulate to discuss the matter on the 20th. The French Consul said that the customs could propose to proceed with diplomatic procedures.</p>
<p>The court examined the body. Xin drowned and his body floated to the surface of the river near Yangshupu the day before yesterday. The Chinese police of the water patrol police station recovered the body and took it to the police station. They then notified Hesheng, the father of the deceased, to come to the scene to identify the body. Hesheng could not help but cry when he saw the body of his son. The head of the police station ordered the body to be handed over to the patrol boat of the Lifeboat Bureau to be transported to the Bureau's mortuary. Deng Jiagen was dispatched to submit a report to the local court, requesting an autopsy. Yesterday afternoon, the prosecutor appointed by the court came to the Bureau to examine the body and ordered the body to be received and buried by the father of the deceased after signing a guarantee, pending verification.</p>
<p>Hometown assistance: The Ningbo Association in Shanghai, after investigating the case of Xin Dingchang, a fellow villager who was brutally shot into the river and killed by a French sailor, dispatched personnel to investigate and confirmed that the facts were true. It immediately convened an emergency meeting to discuss methods of assistance and decided to send a letter to the French Concession Court requesting a fair and thorough investigation, strict punishment of the murderers, and demanding compensation for the loss.</p>
<h3>Pirates Burn and Loot Fengli Town Outside Wusongkou</h3>
<p>Fengli Town, a coastal town outside Wusongkou, was suddenly attacked by nine sailing ships carrying a large group of pirates armed with weapons at about 9:00 PM the night before last. The pirates landed ashore and looted the town from house to house, then set fire to the buildings. The security team and the local fishing community defense group rushed to cooperate in encircling and suppressing the pirates. They engaged in a fierce battle with the pirates in the dark for about two hours. The pirates gradually became overwhelmed and fled back to their boats. The police group took advantage of the victory to pursue them and intercepted a pirate ship on the beach and burned three pirate ships. In this battle, more than thirty pirates were killed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ship Rescues Sailors Who Fell into the Sea</h3>
<p>The Japanese mail ship Rokko Maru came to Shanghai from Moji this time. On the 18th, it sailed to the North Saddle Mountain in the Chinese Sea at 1:00 PM on the 20th. Two Chinese merchant ships were seen overturned by the wind and waves in the sea, and all the sailors on the two ships had fallen into the water. The captain of the Japanese ship immediately ordered the ship to stop and two lifeboats to be lowered into the sea. Seven people were rescued on the spot, including Gu Jinkui, Chen Dulang, Nian Jingou, and Gu Zhuzhen from Caopeng Town, Chongming; and Sha Wanlong, Yuan Ruyun, and Yang Caigou from Yujia Port, Haimen. The two merchant ships have already sunk into the sea. Yesterday, the seven people in distress were brought to Shanghai by Rokko Maru and handed over to the Shanghai Society for transfer to the Public Security Bureau. After the Public Security Bureau received the notification that the ship had arrived at the wharf, they immediately sent police to the ship to take them back.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Looking for Relatives</h3>
<p>A detective named Jiang Anting of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Slow Train Police Department saw a suspicious-looking boy of about eleven or twelve years old, Wang Ade, on the slow train on the second, third, and fourth class cars. Wang Ade was eleven years old and from Hangzhou. His father's name was Shengfu, who was currently a partner at the Houyongcheng Coal Store on Guangfu Road in Shanghai. I became an apprentice at a lacquer shop below the vegetable market at Xinzha Bridge, Shanghai, on the fifth day of the first lunar month of last year. The shop has no name. Because the master abused me, I ran away on the 19th of this month. I took a train from the South Station to Hangzhou to look for my mother. I heard that my mother lived at No. 3 Dashu Lane. After investigation, according to his mother, she had remarried and was unwilling to acknowledge her ex-husband's son. After Cai, the chief of police, investigated, the child claimed to have been abused by his master, and his mother refused to take him in. He was afraid of him wandering, so yesterday he prepared a document and sent the police to escort the child to Shanghai and send him to the police station at the South Station for safekeeping. Yesterday, Zhuang Shouhua, the chief of the Shanghai Section Police Department, sent the police to notify his father to come and sign a guarantee to take him back to prevent him from wandering.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Kidnap a Woman Investigated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wang Zunxiang and others from Nanjing were arrested and transferred to the court for hiding their unmarried sister-in-law, Jing Acui. According to a previous report, the Second District and Second Branch announced yesterday that there were some discrepancies in the report. The incident was that at 5:00 PM on October 19, police Yan Daoqia from the 11th Sentinel Station brought Jing Acui, who he brought from the countryside, to Shanghai to stay at the home of his sister, Chen Jing. Yesterday afternoon, Wang Zunxiang, the elder brother of his unmarried fiancé, invited him to eat at his home and then invited him and his daughter Jing Acui to the Celestial World to watch a play. Because he had to urinate, he did not know where Wang Zunxiang had taken his daughter Jing Acui. When he returned, he could not find Wang Zunxiang or his daughter. This morning, he and his sister Chen Jing found Wang Zunxiang's uncle, Ni Dexin, and his uncle Wang Gaosheng, to help them find her. According to Ni Dexin, Yu Xianfu and Xu Jinqing came to him after the meal to find a letter for him. Jing Acui had been found, and he had to reward them for their efforts before they would take her away. When the five of them went to the Menghua Street teahouse to drink tea, Yu Xianfu told him that he wanted 55 dollars. Because he could not decide on the money, he immediately called his nephew Wang Shanlin and prepared 80 dollars and asked him to return quickly. He handed it over to the guarantor Xu Jinqing and asked him to hand it over to Yu Xianfu after he found the person. Yu Xianfu had already looked at the 80 dollars and took them to Zhi's house in Songyun Lane, Wangyun Road, and found Acui and his nephew Wang Zunxiang. Because Wang Zunxiang hid the person in collusion with Yu Xianfu to extort money, he was unwilling to call the police and asked them to investigate. After the director of the Guo Police Station investigated the details and seized the 80 dollars from Xu Jinqing's side, he sentenced Yu Xianfu to extortion and imposed a severe punishment according to the law. Because he knew his mistake and was very remorseful, he was given a light sentence of three days of detention as a warning. Wang Zunxiang borrowed the name to hide Acui, but there was no definite evidence of his bad intentions. The 80 dollars and Acui were returned to Wang Chen Jing and Wang Shanlin.</p>
<h3>The Belgian Government Awarded Hu Yunqiu the Order of the Crown</h3>
<p>Mr. Hu Yunqiu, a well-known figure in the banking industry, is talented, capable, sincere, and personable. He has worked at HuaBi Bank for 25 years. He has devoted himself to the research and planning of the bank's business. It is recently learned that the Belgian government has awarded Mr. Hu the Order of the Crown in recognition of his diligence in managing affairs for 25 years as if it were one day. His cooperation with HuaBi has made the bank what it is today, and Hu's efforts have been indispensable. The Belgian Minister, Mr. Hua Luosi, was ordered by the government to present the award to Mr. Hu.</p>
<h3>News After Liu Junfu Was Accused</h3>
<p>Qiao Jiyuan, Member of the Party Standing Committee</p>
<p>Was Suddenly Accused of False Accusation by Liu</p>
<p>Liu Junfu of Huajing Town, a southwest village in Shanghai, was previously accused by Chen Xinlou of being a local tyrant and evil gentry. At that time, the local merchants and people submitted a public report to the county government, and the Sixth Branch of the Second District of the Shanghai County Party Department also reported Liu. The Second District Party Department submitted it to the Shanghai County Party Department, which appointed Comrade Lü Juefei to investigate and confirm the case. The Shanghai Local Court investigated the case of Chen's accusation against Liu for three or four weeks. Three or four weeks ago, it was suddenly reported that the court had dismissed the case against Liu Junfu. However, the plaintiff, Chen Xinlou, had not received the dismissal order for some reason. According to the Criminal Procedure Law, the dismissal order must be delivered to the informant and the defendant within seven days after the dismissal. If there is any objection, they may apply for reconsideration. The plaintiff is thoroughly investigating the overdue dismissal order. Unexpectedly, Liu Junfu suddenly used lightning speed to sue Chen Xinlou, Qiao Jiyuan, and others for false accusations in the Shanghai Local Court. Qiao is a member of the Standing Committee of the Sixth Branch of the Second District Party Department. He has now hired lawyer Zhou Xiaoan to handle the litigation. The general idea of his defense is: (1) When Chen Xinlou accused Liu Junfu of being a local tyrant, Qiao was neither a co-plaintiff nor had any relationship with him, so he did not constitute a reason for false accusation; (2) The report of the Sixth Branch of the Second District of the Shanghai County Party Department against Liu for being a local tyrant was submitted by the Branch to the Second District Party Department and then to the Shanghai County Party Department. The County Party Department appointed Comrade Lü Juefei to investigate and confirm the case. At that time, Qiao Jiyuan was only a member of the Standing Committee of the Sixth Branch. According to the regulations, all matters of the Branch must be decided by the majority of the Executive Committee and handled by the Executive Committee in accordance with the resolutions. Therefore, the report of the local tyrant was purely an action of the entire Party Department and was not Qiao Jiyuan's personal action. This time, the plaintiff not only made a mistake in the subject of the litigation, but also had no reason for the allegations. The case is scheduled to be heard today (22nd) at 3:00 PM. Qiao went to the County Party Department yesterday to report everything. The County Party Department, seeing that Liu Junfu had resumed his old ways shortly after his report, did not understand the difference between public legal persons and private legal persons and intended to harm him. Therefore, it intended to provide assistance to Qiao Jiyuan and others based on the old case.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Offers Rewards to Solve Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau recently received an order from the Municipal Government that the case of a certain official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who was kidnapped in the French Concession has been outstanding for many days and that efforts should be stepped up to arrest the perpetrators. Director Yuan was very angry that the case had been repeatedly ordered to be strictly investigated but there were still no clues. Yesterday, he specially awarded one thousand yuan and strictly ordered all districts and teams to step up their investigation and solve the case as soon as possible. It is thought that the Bureau has always been very strict in arresting criminals, and now it must solve the case. Moreover, with the heavy reward, the kidnappers will definitely not be able to escape the law.</p>
<h3>American World Tour Group Arrives Today</h3>
<p>One Hundred and Seventy-Five People</p>
<p>The American World Tour Group of one hundred and seventy-five people arrived in China from New York on the Marolo. They arrived in Weihaiwei first and then came to Shanghai. Yesterday, the ship sent a telegram saying that it would arrive in Shanghai today. It will enter the port at 9:00 AM and stop at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. The manager of the Da Lai Foreign Company will manage the members of each group. The members will stay in Shanghai for two days and then take the original ship to Hong Kong and then to Europe.</p>
<h3>Money in the Car Unharmed</h3>
<p>The Chauffeur Escaped Dangerously</p>
<p>At about 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a factory in East Shanghai was transporting more than 3,000 yuan in banknotes in a car to pay wages. Who knew that when they were traveling to Pingliang Road, two men suddenly rushed out of the road with guns in their hands and stopped the car, saying they wanted to search it. The chauffeur saw that the situation was not good and was afraid of being targeted by bandits, so he immediately ran away. The money in the car was preserved.</p>
<h3>Two Suicides</h3>
<p>Feng Jinhong, a Cantonese aged thirty-six, threw himself into the river. He used to work in the military but is now unemployed in Shanghai, so he is under severe economic pressure. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, he went to the Bund on Erma Road alone and threw himself into the river. He was seen by post No. 987 of the General Patrol Room, who rescued him. He was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the doctor gave him medicine and treatment, he said that he was fine. He was still taken to the police station by the original police to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Shen Yuanfu, a native of Wuxi, who worked at the Delong Biscuit Company at the intersection of Huanghe Road and Gariel Road in the French Concession, hanged himself. He was thirty-five years old. Because he was addicted to opium, he was often short of money. His father repeatedly advised him to quit, but he did not listen and could not make up his mind to stop smoking. At 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, because he had no money to buy cigarettes, he could not resist the addiction. In a moment of anger, he suddenly committed suicide and hanged himself in the room. He was taken to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Dismissal of Gu Xiaoyan's Case</h3>
<p>Gu Xiaoyan, a famous surgeon from Shanghai South, treated Fang Yongqin's son Shuangxi on July 15th of this year. After the Bureau of Public Health temporarily suspended his license, the Municipal Government ordered its prior return. The case was then sent to the Shanghai District Court for investigation. It is now known that the Procuratorate has also been extremely cautious about this matter, conducting detailed investigations and reviewing testimonies. Subsequently, the case was sent to the Wu County Chinese Medicine Association for assessment, which replied that Dr. Gu had not made any mistakes. The assessment results were no different from the opinions of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Association. Therefore, the court, in accordance with the law, rendered a decision of non-prosecution. Dr. Gu has been falsely accused and his innocence is now clearly established.</p>
<h3>Lin Long Dies by Poisoning</h3>
<p>On the 18th of this month, a man from Fujian named Lin Long arrived at Room 439 of the Central Hotel on Wuma Road, Hubei Road, and told the tea server to wake him up the next morning. The tea server agreed. The next morning, the tea server went to the room but found the door tightly closed. After knocking without a response, the tea server suspected something was wrong and broke the door open. Lin was lying on the bed, his face pale and lifeless. He appeared to have taken opium poison. The tea server reported to the front desk, who in turn reported to the Lao Zha Police Station in charge of the area. Detectives were ordered to take the body to the mortuary on Fietou Road for examination. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, a prosecutor from the Special District District Court, arrived at the mortuary to confirm the cause of death. As no family members were found, it was ordered that the body be taken to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Compensation Issues in the Tragic Death of Xia Axin</h3>
<p>Demanding a Loss of 15,000 Taels</p>
<p>Xia Axin, a 55-year-old Ningbo man residing at No. 37, Shan Zhong Road, in the French Concession and working as a launderer, was riding a bicycle in front of his door at 3 PM on the 3rd of this month, intending to go somewhere. A cargo truck driven by Wang Xingchang and a car driven by Mao Youlun were approaching from both directions, causing Xia to be unable to avoid them and being struck and killed by Wang's truck. Details of the incident were previously reported. Yesterday, the police brought all the witnesses to the French Court for investigation. The plaintiff, the deceased's wife Xia Liangshi, complained that her husband had been tragically struck and killed, requesting justice. Attorney Ted Beck, representing the plaintiff, stated that the deceased had just left his house and was about to get on his bicycle when he was struck by Wang Xingchang's truck. The location where he was struck was a place where cars should not have been driving, indicating that the deceased was not at fault. The blame should be borne by both defendants. The deceased left behind a wife and young children, all of whom relied on him for support. Now that he has been struck and killed, they have no one to rely on. Therefore, they are requesting compensation for a loss of 15,000 taels. Defendant Mao Youlun, represented by Attorney Ba He, argued that two issues need to be studied in this case. The first is the issue of responsibility, which requires proving which of the two defendants was at fault. My client's car was traveling from north to south and saw a person on a bicycle ahead. To avoid danger, he immediately swerved to the left. Unexpectedly, Wang Xingchang's truck came speeding from the opposite direction, first overturning my client's car and then striking the deceased. From this perspective, the responsibility should be borne by the second defendant, Wang Xingchang. The second is the issue of loss. In the case of Shen Pengnian, who was struck and killed, my law firm previously represented the family. Mr. Shen was highly respected in the literary world and earned six to seven hundred yuan a month. He had many children at home. At that time, they demanded a loss of 20,000 yuan, but the court only awarded 6,000 yuan in compensation. The loss demanded by the plaintiff in this case is far too large. At this point, it was past noon, and the Chinese and Western officials adjourned to await further hearing and verification.</p>
<h3>Coal Pile Suddenly Ignites Due to Carelessness</h3>
<p>At around 5 AM yesterday morning, dozens of tons of loose coal piled up in the wasteland of the Third Coal Depot of Mitsui Yoko, across from the Huishan Wharf in Pudong. Due to a worker's carelessness, a cigarette butt was thrown into the loose coal, causing it to suddenly ignite, with thick smoke billowing and flames raging. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade dispatched a fire boat to douse the flames, which were extinguished after a short while. Only a few tons of loose coal were burned, and fortunately, the fire did not spread to the foundations of the warehouses.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Sues Husband for Assault and Expulsion, Seeking Divorce</h3>
<p>Cai Linzhen (i.e., Zhu Cai's wife), a young woman from this locality, recently engaged a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the District Court against her husband, Zhu Qiuyan, for divorce. Her grounds are repeated abuse and expulsion, as well as the removal and concealment of her dowry. Her objectives are divorce, the return of her dowry valued at 1,277 yuan, and alimony (i.e., support payments) of 700 yuan. Her statement roughly states that the plaintiff is 19 years old, resides at 161 Xin Puyu Road, and was married to the defendant, Zhu Qiuyan, through a matchmaker on December 12th of last year. In January of the following year, the defendant ordered the plaintiff to return to her mother's home to borrow 200 yuan. Before long, the defendant again ordered the plaintiff to borrow money. Because the plaintiff had nowhere to borrow from, she politely refused. The defendant resented this and beat the plaintiff, while removing and concealing her dowry at Zhang Tinggui's home (Zhang is the defendant's foster father), and so on. At the previous hearing, the defendant Zhu Qiuyan did not appear. His mother, Zhu Wu, appeared in court and argued that her son and daughter-in-law had a good relationship and that he had not beaten her, only had verbal arguments. The court ordered a re-summons. Yesterday, the hearing continued. At 10 AM, Judge Zhang Jinjian again opened the second courtroom. Both parties arrived with their lawyers, and there were many spectators, mostly women who were relatives of the defendant. After the judge took the bench, he ordered the defendant, Zhu Qiuyan, to the stand. He stated that he was 18 years old, a local resident, and lived at 28 Tianzhutang Street, south of Malu Bridge. He currently works as a typesetter in the printing house in North Nicheng Bridge and is still learning his trade. The plaintiff is his legal wife. Because she often returns to Ningbo, they sometimes have verbal arguments, but he has not beaten her. (Question) Did you order the plaintiff to borrow money? (Answer) No. (Question) Is the house you live in your own property? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Are you currently trying to sell it? (Answer) Yes, but we haven't agreed on a price yet. (Question) Where is the plaintiff's dowry now? (Answer) Still at home. (Question) What is your opinion on the plaintiff's request for divorce? (Answer) I don't want it. (Question) Did you beat her on June 2nd and June 22nd of this year? (Answer) No. The judge, having obtained the testimony, ordered the plaintiff, Cai Linzhen, to the stand and attempted to reconcile them, advising the plaintiff not to divorce and to return to good terms. (Answer) He doesn't want me outside. It's not that easy now. As for saying that I returned to my mother's home, ask yourself, if my mother is sick, shouldn't I go home to visit her? Next, witness Zhang Tinggui testified that he was 52 years old and lived across from the Dafochang. Zhu Qiuyan is my foster son. The court ordered him to provide a written testimony to be kept on file. (Question) Are the two of them on good terms? (Answer) I heard they were. (Question) Do you know about Qiuyan borrowing money? (Answer) No. (Question) Did he sell the house? (Answer) Yes, but it hasn't been resolved yet. (Question) Is the plaintiff's dowry kept at your house? (Answer) No, that's not the case. (Question) Did you try to mediate? (Answer) Yes, I did. The plaintiff's mother escorted the plaintiff to the defendant's house. The two families had a dispute. I tried to mediate once, but I don't know about other matters. Another witness, a woman named Xing Shen, testified that she was 60 years old and lived on Meixie Road. She was indeed the matchmaker. At first, she heard that they were getting along well, but she doesn't know how they started arguing later. The judge then invited Prosecutor Wu to the court to express his opinion and declared the debate open. The lawyers for both parties stood up and debated back and forth. The plaintiff's side requested that a divorce be granted, as well as compensation for alimony of 700 yuan and the return of her dowry valued at 1,277 yuan. The defendant's lawyer stated that if the plaintiff insisted on a divorce, she must compensate for the loss of 1,455.9 yuan from the wedding. The judge then declared the debate closed and set the judgment for the 25th of this month. Thereupon, the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Pirate Attack on Pinghu Ferry</h3>
<p>Merchants Suffer Significant Losses</p>
<p>In the counties under the jurisdiction of Pudong and West Shanghai, more cotton is planted than rice. Now is the time when cotton from various villages is coming onto the market. Various flower merchants and flower shops in Shanghai have sent their staff to the villages with cash to buy small amounts of cotton in order to make a small profit. There are many such people. However, the atmosphere of bandits in the countryside is not peaceful, and merchants are often robbed on the way, especially in the towns and villages at the intersection of Songjiang and Shanghai. The other day, Chen Kaitai and Lu Hongtai flower shops each sent their staff with more than 3,000 yuan in cash to the villages to buy flowers, accompanied by flower merchant Zhou Jiankang (Zhou also carried more than 1,800 yuan). They boarded the Pinghu regular ferry to various villages to buy flowers. When the ferry arrived at Jin Siliang Bridge in Shanghai City at midnight, it was suddenly encountered by a pirate ship. Five bandits, each holding a box cannon and a pistol, jumped onto the ferry and ransacked the passengers, leaving no one spared. All the cash carried by the flower merchants, Zhou Jiankang and others, totaling more than 5,000 yuan, was robbed. The robbers obtained their loot, abandoned the boat, and escaped ashore. Zhou and others have now returned to Shanghai to report to the owners of the shops and report to the relevant authorities to request an arrest.</p>
<h3>Laborer Killed by Car</h3>
<p>Driver Fined 40 Yuan</p>
<p>Plus 600 Yuan in Compensation</p>
<p>Zhang Taicheng, father of Jiangbei woman Huang Zhangshi, was working as a road laborer when he was struck and killed on the 19th of last month on the Bund of the French Concession by a truck driven by driver Yu Amao. The incident was reported to the French Court, and Judge Zhu conducted an on-site examination and ordered the body to be collected. The police summoned the defendant to the French Court for questioning and awaited a decision. Yesterday, the judgment was reached. The Chinese and Western officials sentenced the defendant Yu Amao to a fine of 40 yuan and ordered him to pay the deceased's family 600 yuan in compensation as a warning.</p>
<h3>Wang Hanlun Cigarettes</h3>
<p>Without Consent of the Individual</p>
<p>Wang Sues for Compensation</p>
<p>Film star Wang Hanlun, represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the French Court, stating that the defendant, Datongnan Tobacco Company, has been manufacturing Wang Hanlun brand cigarettes and selling them in the north since 1928. Her lawyer previously sent a letter to the Hebei Tobacco Tax Bureau, which replied with a letter proving that the defendant's company was producing the cigarettes. The letter is now presented for review. The defendant's company manufactured these brand cigarettes without the plaintiff's prior consent, which is inappropriate. The plaintiff is requesting three things: (1) Confiscation of the cigarettes that have not yet been sold. (2) Prohibition of further manufacturing. (3) Compensation for losses based on business standards. Please investigate the number of products. Calculate each box at 10 yuan, for a total reputation loss of 30,000 yuan. The defendant was also represented by a lawyer, who argued that the plaintiff's allegations were not true. These cigarettes were actually produced by a certain tobacco company, which sold them to a certain factory, which then resold them to the defendant as a gift. The plaintiff should sue the manufacturer, as it has nothing to do with the defendant. Please investigate clearly. The judge adjourned the hearing for further review.</p>
<h3>Interrogation of Robbers in the Zhaofeng Road Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Mao Xiaomao, a Chongming native, worked as a rickshaw puller and lived at No. 570 Zhaofeng Road. At around 1 AM on the 9th of this month, robbers broke into his home and used weapons to rob him of silver and jewelry worth 1,530 yuan. He reported the incident to the Harbin Police Station. Detectives Yan Shiqing, Zhou Kaiwen, Liu Decheng, and others arrested Shen Zhixiang, a Haaimen native, the ringleader of the robbery, in Room 4 of the Kenenghai Road Hu-Ning Hotel. Shen had previously pulled a rickshaw for Mao Xiaomao. The defendant was handed over to the Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This newspaper reported the details. The other day, the Chinese and Western detectives in charge of the case learned that there were still accomplices hiding at No. 2186 Disiwei Road and No. 33 Jiaotong Road. They secretly went to these locations and arrested Zhang Linlin, Liang Lishi, and Zhang Liantao, all from Tongzhou, and brought them into the police station. Yesterday morning, they were brought to the Third Criminal Court of the Special Court along with Shen Zhixiang. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the case. The victim, Mao Xiaomao, stated that a total of five robbers came that night and robbed him of 630 yuan in cash, 520 yuan in paper money, 200 dimes, a gold bracelet, eight gold rings, a gold band, four gold buttons, and two watches. The silver was the money he had collected during the day. He witnessed the defendant Liang Lishi opening the box and robbing it. He did not see the other robbers. Witness Gong Xishan testified that Zhang Linlin held a gun and threatened him, but he did not see the others. Shen Mao's wife testified that Xiaomao was her father. That night, the defendant Zhang Liantao took off two gold rings from her finger and robbed her of a watch. However, Shen Zhixiang was out that morning and did not return. Child Lu Kaolang testified that the defendant Liang Lishi was present at the scene. Shen Zhixiang then stated that he was the one who initiated the case and first notified Zhang Linlin, who then invited six people to rob. He did not go himself. He received 75 yuan afterward. Zhang Linlin confessed that although Shen invited him, he did not go either. He received 45 yuan afterward. Liang Lishi confessed that he was invited by Shen on the pretext of going out to play. He went to the plaintiff's door and took out a gun, telling him to stand guard outside. He received 24 yuan afterward. Shen and a friend of his, along with Zhang Liantao, went inside to rob. Zhang Liantao confessed that he stood guard inside the door and then fled. He received 24 yuan afterward. Judge Ge Zhitan verified the testimonies and ordered the four defendants, Zhang Linlin and others, to be taken back into custody to await further questioning.</p>
<h3>China Merchants and Two Other Companies Negotiate Rules for Managing Tea Servers on the Shanghai-Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Association previously received instructions from the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs that the tea servers on the Shanghai-Ningbo route ships operated by China Merchants, Sanbei, and Ning-Shao were extorting tips from passengers, causing travelers great hardship. The association was instructed to find a way to stop this. After receiving the order, the association convened a meeting of the above companies and reported the results to the Bureau of Social Affairs. The other day, the Bureau of Social Affairs sent Mr. Zhang Zhenyuan to the Shipping Association to request that the companies concerned be convened again to formulate unified rules for managing tea servers in order to restrict them. Yesterday, the China Merchants and two other companies were convened at the association to discuss the matter. As a result of the meeting, a draft of these management regulations was made and will be sent to the general manager's office of each company for review before being sent to the Shipping Association and forwarded to the Bureau of Social Affairs for consideration and implementation.</p>

The motion was passed, but the words "members" should be changed to "medical community." (2) Wang Qizhang proposed a discussion of the legal issues of the Physicians' Association, explaining that the Western Medicine Regulations passed by the Legislative Yuan are stricter than the Ministry of Health's Provisional Regulations for Physicians, requiring examinations according to foreign standards, and that examinations cannot be held, and registration is naturally not possible. The association and its members no longer have a legal basis. Therefore, he proposed that the association discuss a proper solution. It was decided to hand it over to the Executive Committee, which would appoint a special committee to organize a committee to consider the matter at length. (3) Chen Rongzhang proposed that the association should be responsible for protecting its members in the event of disputes or lawsuits between patients and members. The motion was passed, but it must be divided into two types: (A) Disputes concerning medical treatment and medicine shall be certified or mediated by the association.

<h3>Letter Requesting Construction of New-Style Slaughterhouses</h3>
<p>Commodity Inspection Bureau Sends Letter to Governments of Various Cities and Counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>The livestock products and by-products of our country have always been a major part of export commodities. The annual value of national products is about 200 million yuan. However, in recent years, various countries have used the excuse that the livestock of our country do not meet sanitary standards and have banned imports, causing significant losses to domestic merchants. The reason is that provinces and counties in our country have not established new-style slaughterhouses and cannot provide effective proof that livestock products have undergone pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection. The Livestock Products and By-products Inspection Office of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, in view of this, is actively promoting the establishment of public slaughterhouses and implementing pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspection so that the export products of our country can meet world public health conditions and foreigners can no longer find excuses. Previously, it sent personnel to various places to investigate the situation of slaughterhouses and submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to consult the Ministry of Health and forward it to the provincial and municipal governments to order the governments of cities and counties along the railway to establish new-style slaughterhouses in the city and county centers. Recently, in order to widely promote and promote early realization, it published a small booklet on the reasons and methods for building public slaughterhouses in various provinces, cities, and counties across the country and sent it to the governments of various cities and counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, requesting that they find a way to construct new-style slaughterhouses with relatively complete scale in the central areas within one year to meet the needs. It is now reported that the governments of Dongyang and Jiaxing counties in Zhejiang Province have replied that they are planning and preparing to construct them.</p>

<h3>Bureau of Public Health Revokes Xu Jianquan's Denture License</h3>
<p>Xu Jianquan, the owner of the Xu Jianquan Denture Shop at No. 85 Oujia Road, had registered with the Municipal Bureau of Public Health and obtained a denture license. Recently, for unknown reasons, he leased the shop to Li Yuanhua and privately transferred the denture license. Li Yuanhua then continued to operate the business under the false pretense of the license. This was discovered by the Bureau of Public Health sanitation inspector. Li Yuanhua, knowing that he had violated the regulations, bribed the sanitation inspector in an attempt to escape punishment. The sanitation inspector was unmoved and brought Li Yuanhua, along with Xu Jianquan's denture license, to the police station for interrogation. The director of the station fined him 30 yuan. Xu Jianquan's denture license was revoked by the Bureau of Public Health.</p>

Therefore, it will hold an election establishment meeting on October 26. In addition to inviting senior successors to participate in guidance, it will also request the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Civil Training Committee to send personnel to guide the election establishment.

(B) Each member is planning to be issued a membership certificate with all the association's constitution printed on it for inspection, pending the Executive Committee's decision to issue it and recover the cost of 1 dime per certificate. (C) Yang Wendao read the constitution aloud to the public. The rights of male and female members are quite equal and treated equally. When the member's own parents, wife, or husband pass away, they have the right to receive a funeral allowance. It was decided that each funeral allowance would be 100 yuan, plus 20 yuan for carriage expenses. However, it must be verified by a dispatched investigator before it can be issued. As for the marriage of members, a gift of 4 yuan will be sent, and then 2 yuan will be sent to celebrate the birth of a son or daughter to express congratulations. (D) If a member dies in another city, his or her family members may guarantee to receive the funeral allowance, but if the whole family leaves the city, the family members shall not send anything other than incense money of 2 yuan to express condolences.

The content published in your newspaper's local news column on October 19th is a misreport and should be corrected. Sincerely, Ye Cai Zhen, October 19, Year 19. Yesterday, I read in your newspaper a news item about a man from Nantong, Xu Yixi, who drowned himself. After investigating, there were many inaccuracies. The corrections are as follows: The deceased was Xu Yilan, also known as Hu Hou, from Jinsha, Nantong. He used to make ropes for a living at his mother's place.

<p>Husband: Oh dear, where did all these books come from, and why are they all about economics?</p>
<p>Wife: Didn't you tell me last week that managing a household requires understanding economics? So, I spent my entire monthly allowance on economics books.</p>
<p>Husband: Oh my, I meant to tell you to be more frugal.</p>
<p>Wife: Who told you to beat around the bush?</p>
<p>Customer: Today's steak is too tough, not as good as last time.</p>

<p>Woman A: Last night, I sang at a concert and had great success. My voice was excellent and filled the hall.</p>
<p>Woman B: Yes, I was there last night too and saw many guests getting up and leaving halfway through. Most of them were probably giving up their seats to allow your voice to fill the hall.</p>
<p>Woman (bumped into by a man striding confidently with chest puffed out): Sir, where are your eyes? Why are you walking into people?</p>

<h3>A Record of the Moving of Former President Tan's Remains</h3>
<p>— Zheng Lugeng</p>
<p>Several weeks have passed since the passing of Tan Gong, President of the Executive Yuan. Heaven did not spare us, taking away our elder statesman, and the country is in mourning, with shock both at home and abroad. The Central Government, remembering his meritorious service, specially appointed a commissioner to organize the funeral committee and issued the National Funeral Law and National Funeral Ceremony procedures to show the Party and the nation's intention to reward merit and promote thrift. After the National Day celebration, the remains were moved to the First Park. On that day, the ceremony was solemn and extremely sorrowful. Notables of the Party and the nation arrived early at the Tan family's residence to await the carrying of the coffin. Plain cars and white horses followed one after another. Along the way, the security was tight, with guards standing watch, and the citizens who waited on the roadside numbered in the tens of thousands, creating a scene of empty streets. Around 9 AM, after the floral tributes and public memorial, the cannon was fired to begin the moving of the remains. Amidst the throng of heads, the funeral banner fluttered, and mournful music resonated. Tang Ke's vehicle led the way, followed by the commander-in-chief, Gu Zhenglun, leading each line in an orderly procession. First was the army honor guard, a company of cavalry holding spears and pressing their reins, followed by a full regiment of infantry carrying guns and proceeding slowly. Next was the navy honor guard, followed by the police honor guard, with vehicles and horses interspersed, creating an extremely somber scene. Then, representatives from various places who came to escort the remains advanced in order, forming the fifth line, numbering several tens of groups, proceeding in a meandering fashion. All the staff of the Executive Yuan wore blue robes and black vests made of domestic goods, while female staff members wore blue cloth qipaos, creating a solemn atmosphere. Military and political departments and other military organizations were fully armed, while others wore either Chinese or Western attire, all conveying a sense of sighing and grief within a solemn and quiet atmosphere. The sixth line consisted of Party, government, and military leaders, foreign guests, relatives, and family members holding the ropes attached to the coffin. The hearse was Executive Yuan vehicle number 104, which Tan Gong had used during his lifetime, with a portrait of Tan Gong hanging inside, and four of his beloved horses leading the way, decorated with red brocade ropes several feet long. Chiang Kai-shek, in military uniform, held the front rope, his expression filled with sorrow, reflecting the deep pain of losing a close friend. The rest followed in their respective ranks, holding the ropes. The seventh line consisted of the coffin and the funeral vehicles escorting the remains. The coffin was covered with pure black satin, with the Party flag and national flag draped over it, without ornate decorations. Sixty-four pallbearers in plain clothes with blue edges alternated in carrying the coffin. The family members wore black mourning attire to show their endless filial piety. The three daughters of the deceased rode in one carriage, followed by the eldest daughter-in-law, a Westerner, riding in another carriage, their faces stained with tears, showing that the "Liao E" poem should not be abandoned. The eighth line was a cavalry squad bringing up the rear. From evening until the end, only the sound of horses' hooves, the sound of footsteps, the sound of solemn orders, and the sound of the wings of the planes circling in the sky to protect the remains could be heard, creating a scene of solemnity and grief. Oh, how great! Before each honor guard squad, there was a mounted officer in charge of command and discipline. In addition, each line had a band leading the way, infantry bringing up the rear, boy scouts maintaining order, and motorcycles patrolling back and forth. After about an hour, they arrived at the mourning hall to enshrine the remains and perform the public memorial service, and then dispersed. Recording the main points of the event, one cannot help but feel the sorrow of the mountain collapsing and the tree decaying. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Yang Xingfo's Avian Obsession</h3>
<p>— Lean Sheep</p>
<p>I recently read in a newspaper a story about Yang Xingfo, a prominent figure in the Party and former Vice President of the University Council, stating that Mr. Yang had a fondness for horses and often prepared two fine steeds in Beijing, riding them to the suburbs at dawn, and sincerely welcoming anyone, whether known or unknown, to ride alongside him. This reminded me of what my friend Zhang Jun told me, that Mr. Yang not only loved horses but also liked to raise birds, such as thrushes, white-feathered parrots, and more, up to a dozen species, all of which were cherished and played with by Mr. Yang. When he was at home, he would often use them for entertainment. One day, he went out for business, and while his family was feeding the birds, one of Mr. Yang's favorite white-feathered parrots escaped from its cage. Mr. Yang was quite upset when he returned and found out, but he couldn't blame his family deeply and remained unhappy for several days. Later, Mr. Yang wrote a poem about the flying bird, saying, "I love birds and rejoice, flapping wings learning to escape Zen. The empty cage remains, exhaustion shows its return is known." The bird's heart overflows in his words.</p>
<h3>Record of the Grand Gathering at Fudan University</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhenchao</p>
<p>Fudan University held a grand gathering for its 25th anniversary for three days. Jiangwan Road was suddenly filled with traffic. There were ball games on the 16th, the anniversary ceremony, the awarding of honorary doctorates, and the opening of the girls' dormitory on the 17th, but I was unable to attend due to circumstances. On the 18th, my sister Hui came from Suzhou, so we went together. After lunch, we set off, but there was no room even to stand on the long-distance bus. When we arrived at Fudan, the carnival had not yet opened.</p>
<p>Few Tickets, Many People The carnival was held in the gymnasium, and upon entering, we saw only a mass of heads moving around. We couldn't sit or stand properly. Just as we were feeling frustrated, my friend Lu Chen came from outside. Lu is a student at Fudan and will graduate next summer. He is an excellent athlete and a pillar of Fudan's basketball team. Seeing the situation, he apologized for the inadequate reception and quickly found a ticket for us, leading us to a special seat. However, all the seats were taken, so he managed to find one in the front row. I then sat on a blank piece of paper covering a board next to it. The students of Fudan University treated us warmly, and I was deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Melodious Piano Music The curtain opened, and a female student, Ms. Ji Wanyi, performed a solo piano piece, creating an extremely gentle melody, clear and melodious like a nightingale singing in a valley. Her fingering skills were superb, but unfortunately, the order was not ideal, and those sitting in the back were unable to hear it fully. Ms. Ji graduated from Qiming Girls' School in Shanghai West and is beautiful and intelligent. Her beautiful piano playing has a long history.</p>
<p>Witty Dance Mr. Han Ligen performed a solo comic skit, wearing leather shoes and a long robe covered with a woman's half-sleeve jacket. First, he acted as an old country bumpkin visiting the Great Eastern Dance Hall, and then he spoke in various dialects, which were comical and made the whole hall roar with laughter. He said that people dance, but he dances at the Huangpu River, implying that those who are obsessed with dancing are in danger of ending up in the Huangpu River. His words were profound and meaningful, and his humor contained a solemn air.</p>
<p>Extremely Crowded and Embarrassing The special seats were limited, but there were many guests, making it difficult for the reception. Those who couldn't find seats had to stand, and even those who were sitting had to stand as well. Just as I was standing and watching, Ms. Ji Wanyi and her friend came from behind, saw the clean white paper on the board, and unknowingly sat down. Seeing this, I was extremely embarrassed but couldn't tell them directly. I was afraid of disturbing them by squeezing, but I couldn't avoid them. The Fudan students then asked the ladies to sit in the back, and I was able to sit down again. This also shows how crowded it was.</p>
<p>News of Sister Li Minghui I haven't heard from Ms. Li Minghui for a long time, and the information I have is contradictory. Suddenly, I heard someone behind me say that Li Minghui went to Hong Kong last week. If you want to get her address, you can ask at a bookstore on North Sichuan Road. Mr. Li is now in Harbin and will be returning to Shanghai soon. I knew that it was about Li Minghui, so I turned around and saw three or four of Mr. Li's students, including Ms. Zhang Meibao, telling a Fudan student.</p>
<p>Longing for the East Palace There were many other performances, including martial arts, Cantonese opera, and songs and dances, which I can't record in detail. The meeting ended when dusk was approaching. I met my friend Tao Lianghe, who is studying journalism. I asked him to guide me to see the whole school. Tao said that the East Palace (girls' dormitory) is not open today, which I heard with disappointment. Looking into the distance, I could only see the lights shining brightly and the female students chatting and laughing happily. Visiting the East Palace can only wait until next year. We smiled at each other and returned home.</p>
<h3>Book Bed and Medicine Stove</h3>
<p>— Meixi</p>
<p>Since entering the capital, it has been almost a month and a half. In my solitude, I am drunk and bedridden. There are poems by Ding Chang on my pillow, so I picked up some of his lines and got a few poems. Alas, Lan Cheng's words are less joyful, and Yu Xi's thoughts are more graceful. Even the sages of the past could not avoid sorrow when writing about current events, especially since the weather is cold with wind, and the days pass quickly. I hate being human and cannot be without emotion. There are precedents for fragrant crumbs and otter offerings. In this matter, this ambition is tears and sound. I will use my illness to let go of my worries. The poems say: "A hairpin and a pendant, I know the separation. The world is free to discuss, drunk half a glass. Rouse the sea plum red under the curtain, the spirit in my chest wants to become a cloud." "Autumn heart like the sea, like the tide. Dust becomes dust, feelings do not subside. Can I repay the three lives of hidden grievance, golden hair and sideburns floating in the wind." "The moonlit ground and cloud steps are specially allowed to be cold, and clear tears return in a dream. Now, after the great tribulation of rebirth, I will manage to see the mountains for fifty years." "A hundred years of heart will return to peace, experiencing the world of flowers and enlightenment. Do not complain that the ferry bridge is a guest for a long time, and the ends of the earth shake hands with all the literati (referring to Shou Juan, Cang Jun, and Yanhong)." "Red is lovesickness, green is sorrow. Over the years, flowers and plants have been cold in Suzhou. What can a scholar do with his strategy, abandon the mountains and lakes for a flute of autumn." "There are other words of weeping before the wine, what other method can send off this life. Plum souls and chrysanthemum shadows have been discussed, and if one day the hate sea is filled." "Clouds and smoke in ten thousand forms engulf the horse's hooves, singing and weeping endlessly, every word is true. It turns out that the peach blossom heart is not dead, and only allows the body to store the kernel of spring." "Double paddles and seagull waves, again and again. Do not allow red beans to dominate lovesickness. Fragrant orchids judge the past wrong, ashamed of drifting and not having a period." "Tired eyes by the zither overlook the wilderness, tears wet the red skirt and never end. Eliminate my mountain and snow complaints, a line of emerald ink, a sealed letter." "The unfinished end is still illusory, and the young man strikes his sword and blows the Xiao. The setting sun suddenly falls in the Central Plains, but there is only an autumn soul that cannot be summoned." "Looking north at Gu Ling, looking south at Wild Goose, do not betray the kindness of your parents for a hundred years. Do not stain your traveling clothes with ordinary tears, throw them into the flood and give them to the void." "Singing and crying, the predecessors are more sentimental, do not throw away your strength to trade talent. Light the broken wall with a lamp and burn poetry, and give it to the mandarin ducks to complain unevenly." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Record of Art Studies in Rome (II)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>(1) The Ancient Colosseum This surviving ancient site is not only one of the largest existing buildings in the world, but also its ingenious arrangement of gates, the application of various Greek capitals, and its representation of the Tilus era. At that time, the arena could accommodate six thousand people. Historically, it was the site of the most brutal gladiatorial contests and was used as a killing field for clergy. When ancient Rome rejected foreign religions, countless Christians were sacrificed in the arena, devoured alive by wild beasts. There was also a cruel gladiatorial contest in which strong and healthy warriors competed in this arena. The winner would listen to the king's command, and the king would kill the loser by pointing his thumb down. If the king pointed up, the loser could live, but most losers were given death. There were often best friends who killed each other. The despotic king was extremely brutal. However, this arena remains today as the only symbol of ancient Rome.</p>
<p>(2) St. Peter's Basilica The scale of this church is even larger than St. Paul's. The outer square has more than three hundred large stone columns arranged in pairs. Each column can be embraced by three people. In the center of the square are two large fountains. Its solemnity and grandeur are unmatched. Upon entering the church, there are circular floor tiles of more than ten feet in length, which are the oldest objects. It is said that the church was rebuilt five hundred years ago. All the structures in the church were designed by the great Renaissance artist Wei Jia Zhu Gelang Jiluo. In the center of the upper part of the church are statues of the Virgin Mary and Jesus by Michelangelo at the age of twenty-five. On the right is a large iron door that is usually closed and opened on Sundays. Inside is a silver-gilt statue of the Virgin Mary, more than ten feet high. Next to the statue are two doors that lead directly to the Pope's residence, where the Roman Pope resides. This church measures one hundred and twenty-two meters in height from the ground to the top of the spire. In the center of the dome is a bronze pavilion made of three thousand four hundred tons of brass. Around the church are dozens of statues of popes from various eras, including the clergyman praying statue of the great sculptor Beruini, which expresses a very pious expression.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (80)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (3)</p>
<p>— The Immortal City La ville eternelle</p>
<p>June 1st Spanish Masterpieces Exhibition and Japanese Modern Painting Exhibition</p>
<p>Greco was a Spanish painter of the late 16th century whose reputation has only recently become widespread. Today, European art critics, whoever they may be, consider him to be the first giant of the Spanish school, or hold him in the same esteem as Velázquez. He was a radical pioneer. Velázquez's paintings were too stable, so many modern avant-garde artists especially revere Greco's paintings. He was born in Crete, Greece, in 1548 and died in Toledo, Spain, in 1614. At the age of twenty-five, he went to Venice and became a disciple of Titian, but he left and studied with Tintoretto, receiving a profound influence. Later, he studied the works of Michelangelo and Correggio in Rome. He was an extremely tragic painter and one of the most intensely mysterious in color. The human bodies he painted were slender, and the divine and holy figures in his religious paintings had a human sweetness. They were all tall and thin men with long chins and pointed toes. He loved to use dark green and blue, completely abandoning the flamboyant style of the Venetian school and changing it to a cold and solemn tone. His bold brushstrokes never adhered to detail, and the scenes were often filled with the excitement of deep depression and magic. His mad heroic posture and spiritual expression were a destruction of the great masters of Italy since Giotto and a progression. He was immersed in studying the Italian school and was able to break away from the conventions of the Italian school, using a sense of detachment to oppose the graceful style of the Florentine school. However, his mysterious tones were still transformed from the Venetian school. His deep tones express the pulse of ecstasy and fantasy and contain a strong expression of Eastern color, because his character was too unique, so there were no successors. However, he gave more vital force to modern art than Velázquez and Goya. Cézanne's deep color scales and solemn realistic style all owe to him. This is easy to see. Among the works I saw this time, the most pleasing are the following:</p>
<p>39 The Tears of St. Peter is not only a masterpiece of Greco but also the only representative work of the Spanish school. Especially in this subject, no one has painted it so violently and sharply, showing the trembling of the nerves. This is really a special stroke in the history of painting.</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Market Rebounds from Low Point</h3>
<p>The situation fluctuated unpredictably. Yesterday, the gold market rebounded from a low point, but only managed to hover around a certain level. After repeated advances and retreats, it ultimately showed signs of decline. The price fluctuated by one or two taels at a time. Overall, the market rose by four and a half taels. It is worth noting that the price had previously broken the 70-tael mark. The exchange rate also showed some signs of easing, with banks slightly selling off. Market sentiment was weak, almost in a state of bewilderment and loss. Trading among various firms was divergent, and arbitrage was very active. There was a lot of coming and going, with Wanxing Shunli, Yuancheng, Yongchun Yuan, Yongyuan, and others mainly buying, while Yuanmao, Yongyu, Dafuchang, and others were mainly selling. From the morning, the market was already weak, mainly due to the mediocre silver market, especially the news that the United States was buying silver ingots. This initially excited market sentiment, but it later subsided in the range of 68-69 taels. In the later market, only Wanxing Shunli and Taichang continued to buy. Yuanmao, Yongfu, Changyu Da, and arbitrage firms were selling. The Indian exchange rate saw a decline, while the gold market initially rose but later declined, hovering around 70 taels. It briefly broke through 72 taels. The exchange rate was stable but easing, with no significant changes. Finally, the price settled at slightly above 69 taels. Therefore, large silver bars should recover today.</p>
<p>The morning opening was already weak. The December gold forward contract fell by two taels and three qian from the opening, reaching 569 taels and 7 qian (gross price of 70 taels and a fraction, down to 69 taels and a fraction). This was because the overseas silver bars were only lower by one-sixteenth, and the silver price did not change as before. Only Zhifeng and Yongyuancheng Yong bought. After that, it briefly exceeded 70 taels by a fraction of 89 qian. Soon, it was still in the lower reaches. Yu Da, Yuanxing, Yongtong, Taichang, and goods companies were selling off, causing a fall of three taels and nine points, to 67 taels and 89 qian, at 20 minutes past nine. The foreign exchange rate was initially flat, then seemed to be stretched. Mitsui bought spot Dalian currency at 1 tael, 2 qian, 6 fen, and a half. Zhongfu and Zhejiang did January UK gold swaps at 17 and a half. After the initial order was announced, there were no further changes, hovering around 68 taels. Internal settlement: China-Belgium sold to American Bank Corporation December US dollars at 39 yuan, 375. Soon, the gold price increased by about two liang to eight liang and eight qian. Around ten o'clock, it fell again to 67 liang and 7 qian, due to arbitrage firms and retail investors selling off. However, exchange transactions were not very active. Afterwards, banks did December US dollar swaps at 39 yuan, 16 points, 7. Also, December UK gold swaps at 174375. The gold price seemed to be on the rise. Buyers were increasingly active. Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Yongcheng, Feng Yong, Chunyuan Yong, Yuanxing Yong, Yuancheng, and speculators rushed to buy. Among them, there were also many who covered short positions, pulling the price up two taels. However, there was a fraction of one liang. At 3:45 past ten, it was 69 liang and 8 qian. Zhengjin had taken January UK gold at 17 and a half. After that, there was no major change, with only a few qian fluctuations. At 11, it was eight liang and seven or eight qian, up to nine liang and three or four qian. After a quarter past eleven, it showed a low trend again. Goods arbitrage and retail investors were all selling. At noon, it was 68 liang and 4 qian at closing. It then went up to eight liang and three or four qian, down to four or five qian. The Dalian group continued to pursue advances. The revealed price was still 618 liang and 6 qian, equivalent to a premium of 50 taels.</p>
<p>The evening market initially rose but later declined. The opening price was 69 liang and 1 qian (gross price of 9 liang). It then jumped from 68 liang and 8 qian to above 70 liang, due to Wanxing Shunli and others buying, because the Dalian bill had risen. The exchange rate was also stable. China Bank and Taiwan did January swaps at 174375. Yongfeng Gold also sold January 174375 to Zhengjin. Yufeng Yong had already settled by China-Belgium at November 17375. Therefore, at 45 minutes past two, it was 71 liang and 3 qian. Later, Fuchang and arbitrage came to sell. Furthermore, Korea sold January UK gold at 174375, causing a retreat of one liang and a fraction. At 3, it was 69 liang and 9 qian. Suddenly, it went up again. Chunyuan Yong, Zhifeng Yong, and the Dalian group successively bought in. The exchange rate was flat. China Bank sold March US dollars to Datong at 39 yuan, 375. January UK gold could still be bought at 174375. However, there was a lot of internal settlement in the industry. Unexpectedly, Datong, Mecca Lee, Sumitomo, etc., all offered December 17375. Until 50 odd minutes past three, it surged to 72 liang and 3 qian. For a while, there were fluctuations of several qian up and down. After a quarter past four, the trend became sluggish and broke the 70-tael mark again. This was because Yu Da, Zhifeng, Tianyu, Yonghongli, and others sold, and goods also saw a lot of selling, so the price could not be sustained. It was 69 liang and 4 qian. Finally, it pulled up four or five qian. The Guangdong group bought slightly. At 30 minutes past four, the closing price was 69 liang and 7 qian, continuing to fall slightly by three or four qian, a decrease of two taels and three qian compared to the previous day. The highest price of the day was 72 liang and 3 qian, and the lowest was 67 liang and 7 qian, a difference of 4 liang and 6 qian. The revealed price was still a premium of 49 taels down to 47 taels. The result was another slight premium of 49 taels. The registered prices were: October, 81 taels; November, 77 taels; December, 68 taels. Water replenishment: 81 taels; aftermarket, 83 taels. Goods: morning market, 69 liang and 9 qian; noon closing, 8 liang and 3 qian; afternoon, 8 liang and 9 qian; closing market, 9 liang and 2 qian.</p>
<p>Trading Chaotic and Divergent</p>
<p>Trading among various firms was chaotic and divergent. Chunyuan Yong, Yuancheng Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, Chenfeng, Yongyuancheng were all buying. Zhifeng Yong and Dadecheng had significant inflows and outflows. Yuanmao Yong, Yu Da, Tong Taichang, Fuchang Yuanheng, Taikang Run, Hengxing, etc., were all selling. Goods: Yongfeng and Kunhe, etc., sold and then bought back. In the afternoon, Chunyuan Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, etc., all bought. Zhifeng Yong initially bought and then sold. Fuchang sold between 71 taels. Yongfeng, Yuanmao Yong, Yufa, Tianyu Yong, Yu Da, and goods companies mostly had an oversupply. In addition, various firms had occasional inflows and outflows. Trading was not active. The Dalian group bought over 3,000 bars in total, and sold 3-400. The Guangdong group had slight inflows and outflows.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Weak and Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market was still flat, but the United States suddenly bought in. The British and American exchange rates rose. Yokohama and Kobe did not see any increase or decrease. HSBC's listed exchange rates did not change. The domestic market seemed to be weak and depreciating, because the gold price had become soft and declined, once breaking the 70-tael mark. However, the result was slightly better than the previous evening. The British pound increased slightly by .0625, the US dollar increased by .125, and the Japanese yen decreased by .25. Chinese merchants and speculators slightly settled, but not as active as the previous day. British pound trading volume was £200,000.

Only the Dalian group slightly sold Japanese yen, and only Mitsui and others bought in, in limited numbers. The gold firms were supposedly drawing in British pounds and hedging the bars, which was still considered profitable at over 70 taels.</p>
<p>The internal British exchange rate consistently had a difference of only .0625. In the morning opening, the price for October and November was 1 shilling, 7 pence, 375.

<h3>The Scale Market Indeed Fell</h3>
<p>Market Overview</p>
<p>During the past week, foreign scales once fell and then rebounded. There was a definite possibility of a downward trend in sight. Subsequently, due to various reasons, it stood firm. Suddenly, the special reason for the sharp rise the day before yesterday was indeed difficult to be a benchmark. In fact, the actual foundation was ultimately weak, resulting in a downward trend yesterday. As for the silver market situation, due to the abundance of head-padded holes, it was ultimately difficult to trend high. It would be satisfactory if it could stand firm.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bond Market Turns Quiet Again</h3>

The futures market was also slightly quieter than the previous day, totaling about 3.8 million in the morning and only 2.5 million in the afternoon, totaling 6.4 million yuan. Of which, Disbandment Bonds accounted for over 2 million, Compilation Inheritance 1.55 million, 19 Customs Duties and various Customs Duties Agreements 1 million, and others were very low.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Declines Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak, and the decline has started again. This is because the spot yarn sales are usually weak, and all groups are lifeless, leading to a lack of confidence. This month's delivery is sufficient, and receivers are relatively short, so the market is particularly weak. However, foreign cotton has risen slightly, and the trend of three-grade yarn is better than that of chemical yarn. The spot yarn demand is not smooth and inventories inevitably increase, causing instability in market prices.</p>
<p>Near-Month Contracts Fell by One or Two</p>
<p>The yarn market opened firm in the early market due to rising foreign cotton, with each month rising by 3-4 qian. However, in the 2-3 session, buy-side was lacking and long positions were settled in near-month contracts, causing the market to fall again. As a result, each month rose or fell by one or two qian. In the afternoon, the yarn price fell 8 qian due to the large number of deliveries for the current month, and the remote month was affected by it, with a high fall of 5,6,7 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,550 bales. It was found that Yiyu sold 1,600 bales, Yuantai 700 bales, Tianlong 700 bales, and the remaining 3-400 bales. Dachangcheng bought 500 bales, Yiyu 450 bales, and the remaining 3-400 bales.</p>
<p>Here are the closing prices:</p>

<p>The cotton market slightly rose, because American cotton tended to be firm, causing long positions to be optimistic and buy-in extra code bags was huge. Japanese merchants also slightly covered shorts, so the market became increasingly tense. However, Hankou market prices were relatively loose, because the situation was quiet and arrivals surged. Only Ningbo groups were buying a lot in Shanghai, due to Ningbo Yaohua being squeezed. The current month's delivery was sufficient, falling 2 qian, but Chinese and foreign factory spot cotton was encroached by Indian and American cotton and there was no large amount of stomach disposal.

<h3>US Government Devotes Effort to Rescuing Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>Over the past two years, the US government, with the Department of Agriculture and the Federal Farm Board as agencies, has continued rural relief efforts. For this purpose, with the agreement of Congress, a huge amount of 500 million yuan has been spent. Recently, it is planned to request an additional expenditure of 500 million yuan. The government devotes the main force of relief to the wheat and cotton markets. The relief policies implemented so far can be divided into three items: (1) Improvement of sales organization: The government first pays attention to this, improving the efficiency of the sales organization taken out by American farmers from the past, and vigorously promoting the organization of broader joint combinations. (2) Government purchase: Because the federal government buys spot goods in the market, the government owns a very large inventory of wheat and cotton. (3) Reduction of cultivated acreage: The government uses all propaganda to persuade farmers to reduce the cultivated acreage of wheat, prevent wheat production above domestic consumption, and has no intention of competing with Australian, Canadian, and Argentine wheat in the overseas market. Because of the government's strength, the adverse effects of falling prices of wheat, cotton, etc. under the above three major policies have been greatly eased. The opposition said that the government's share issue ultimately ended in a major failure. It can be proved by the current low prices of agricultural products. On the one hand, the Federal Farm Board's assistance to the joint combination organization of American farmers in states such as Alganklons, Lucy, Ainai, and California has been visible. It is planned that after the joint combination of farmers in each state is established, a central rice farmers' association will be jointly organized to recruit powerful farmers to cooperate with the Federal Farm Board to assist farmers throughout the United States.</p>

<h3>Flour Market Presents a Stable Trend</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month still showed a stable trend, because the quoted price of foreign wheat was a good rise of 4,5,6 jiao, etc. To the market, since the plunge, people's hearts have turned to stability, because the import of foreign wheat by the majority of small factories may be difficult to catch up with in a month or so, the immediate future is not urgent, so it is too unreasonable to wantonly play smart, the return of the market is still proper. According to the general trend, it is also not possible to know whether this month will still arrive at 3 qian or not. As a result, this month is better than the previous day by 1 fen, November is better by 1 fen, 2 li and a half, December is better by 7 li and a half, and February is better by 1 fen, March is better by 5 li.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Futures Market Still Remains in a Superior Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was still good. This month, due to delivery relations, people's hearts continued to be firm, because the goods on the market were mostly medium and secondary, and the standards of the exchange were mostly unqualified, and the market price plunged and the value was low, so it was easy to cause speculative activity at this time. The return of the immediate market did not go beyond this way. As a result, this month was better than the previous day by 5 fen. November to February each had 2 points good. Because the standard of the spot wheat market was good, the high goods on the market seemed to have rare goods, so yesterday's high price suddenly rose 1 qian, and the medium and secondary also rose 5 fen. Opened Shandong, Niuzhuang Mingguang, Yaowan wheat for a total of 3,000 bags, handled by Shenda,</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Reds Open Higher, Up Two Jiao</h3>

The current price of Javanese sugar was 8.125, and the futures sugar prices for November and December were both 8.00, with little change from the previous prices. The association's market allocated Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white [sugar], but buying interest remained quiet, and sellers were eager to sell, with some even lowering prices in advance to unload their goods. Transaction prices ranged from 7 taels 7 qian 3 fen 7 li 5 hao to 7 taels 7 qian, and transactions were frequent, making the market even weaker. High-quality goods were offered at 7 taels 8 qian, but there were no buyers. Ground fine granulated white [sugar] at 7 taels 8 qian 5 fen also saw few transactions. Japanese sugar transactions were even more sluggish. N Mark was 7 taels 5 qian, YT Mark was 7 taels 7 qian, TX Mark was 7 taels 9 qian 5 fen, and TM Mark was 7 taels 5 qian. YP Mark was out of stock.

<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: 500 Packages of Longkou Vermicelli Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>Top Brand Opens at 20 Taels 0 Qian 2</p>
<p>Longkou vermicelli, due to depleted inventories in Shanghai, various firms had been procuring from local sources. It is now known that the Lianxing steamer has imported over 500 packages, with passenger goods and self-managed dried goods each accounting for half. The Yantai gang's Xiesheng Dongke company opened with the top brand Shuangfeng vermicelli, 60 packages, with the price rising to 20 taels 0 qian 2 fen, which were distributed to firms on Yangxing Street and in the Nanshi area, creating a stable and promising market situation.</p>
<h3>Dragon Sprout Vegetables: High-Quality Goods Increase in Price</h3>
<p>The old stock of vegetables previously stored in various stalls had long been sold out. New crops from various regions were generally well-received, leading to a decline in supply. However, demand from the passenger gangs has not yet increased significantly. Therefore, although the supply is quite short, sales are limited, but market prices have gradually increased. Currently, Xilan vegetables are selling for 11 taels to 10 taels 0 qian 5 fen, Wudun vegetables for 8 taels 2 qian 3 qian, Dilong vegetables for 7 taels 7 qian, and Shimao vegetables are out of stock and lack a market. Yesterday, the Dragon Sprout vegetables dealers opened with 66 packages of high-quality goods, with the price rising sharply to 10 taels 0 qian 2 fen, and the firms were very eager to buy, immediately distributing the goods. Given the briskness of the market, further price increases are expected.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Factories Must Wait for Overseas Telegrams to Transfer</h3>
<p>Since the end of last week, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market, after various European firms invited manufacturers to negotiate the Shanghai factory's futures trading, the market price has been quite volatile. Because the manufacturers' silk cocoon inventory is exhausted, they all hold high prices before selling, and the market price is relatively high. Various European firms have sent telegrams to overseas offices and must wait for telegrams to transfer before transactions can be concluded. Yesterday, only Zhonghe imported 15 packages of dried silk, and Kechang imported 6 packages of Sichuan silk, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<h3>Lyon Italian Silk Turns from Firm to Rising</h3>
<p>Factory Sales are Gradually Starting to Move; Prices All Rise Several Francs</p>
<p>The Lyon market's raw silk market has gradually become active in the first half of the week, and the silk factories are expected to begin purchasing materials for spring silk. On Friday and Saturday, the Italian silk factories negotiated and concluded over 1,800 kilos of transactions, with prices turning from firm to rising. Special grade silk was priced at 335 francs per kilo, Grade A silk at 293 francs, and superior grade silk at 271 francs, an increase of 2-3 francs.</p>
<h3>Italian Cocoon Prices Still Trending Weak</h3>
<p>European sales of Italian silk are sluggish... Factory purchases still show no turnaround.</p>
<p>The Milan market's Italian cocoon market remains sluggish. Because European sales of Italian silk have not improved, and silk stocks are increasing daily, silk mills are still uninterested in purchasing raw materials, and cocoon prices continue to weaken. Italian spring cocoons are only offered at 81 lire per kilo, summer cocoons at 73 lire, and autumn cocoons at 60 lire, each down 1-2 lire.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Tea: Bulk Sales to America Show Slight Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai foreign firm tea market, the Huzhou Pingshui bulk sales to American firms had become active. The entire city purchased 5,371 boxes through Jinlong Foreign Firm and Huacha Company, with sales prices ranging from 35 to 39 taels, not much different from before. The Luxiang Zhenmei and British firm businesses still do not have large-scale sales channels. The Russian firm's assistance association is still making every effort to search for and purchase Gongxi tea and Qining black tea, but their offered prices are very low, and the overall tea market cannot yet be considered optimistic.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fair and Market Prices are Trending Upward</h3>
<p>Local Buyers' Appetite is Very Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday was the date for Fair Foreign Firm's auction of various piece goods, with a total of 46 lots of various goods, totaling 1,770 pieces. Compared to the previous week, there were more lots, with an additional 5 lots totaling 109 pieces. However, one lot of (fine cloth), 60 pieces, was not sold. Sales from various gangs were still strong, and local merchants also slightly increased their purchases. As for prices, they are generally trending upward, mainly because the quantity of goods purchased was limited, which drove up prices. (Silk fabrics) increased by 5 fen to 1 qian 7 fen 5 li per piece, and Tiansi Gold increased by 3 qian compared to the previous week. (Western Ning silk) increased by 7 li 5 hao per yard, and (Yuan Velvet), such as Liu Hai brand, increased by 6 fen 5 li. (Western satin) increased by 5 li to 3 fen 7 li 5 hao. (City cloth) remained stable, and (Bleached cloth) increased by several fen to 2 qian per piece. Market sentiment seems to be turning strong.

<h3>Yuanzhi Tribute Cloth is Becoming Increasingly Popular</h3>
<p>Since the autumn, sales of Yuanqing straight tribute cloth have increased sharply, and the sales price has also risen significantly. After the sharp contraction in foreign exchange, few merchants have placed orders, resulting in a shortage of arrivals. The stocks stored in various Shanghai warehouses are gradually being sold out, with supply falling short of demand. In recent days, demand from both local and foreign buyers has been strong, and retail sales have already increased significantly. The previously allocated tribute cloth is now sold out, so further purchases must be made. Yesterday, the trend at the association was brisk, and sales prices for general goods increased by 1-2 qian. Other ordinary Yuanzhi tribute cloth, such as three-tael-plus and four-tael-three-four-qian grades, are temporarily difficult to select. The market sentiment for straight tribute cloth is particularly brisk, and demand from the Harbin gang is very strong. It is reported that 40-50 boxes were sold last week, with prices changing three times a day, and the shortage and briskness are even greater than that of double-sided high-quality goods.</p>

<h3>New York Automobile Traffic</h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>New York's traffic is world-renowned. According to actual time studies, the average speed of cars and horses on the north-south streets south of 42nd Street is 11.3 miles per hour. Under these conditions, the aforementioned streets see over 10,000 vehicles pass per hour. The congestion on the streets is really due to the island shape of New York City, which is 12.5 miles long and 2.5 miles wide. Near the pointed top, the widest point is only 1.5 miles. In this small area, countless millions of automobiles and carriages pass through every day. The automobile routes between New York and Manhattan are connected by large bridges. In addition to some large bridges, there are also more than 20 waterways, with hundreds of harbor ferries coming and going every day, carrying passengers and transporting vehicles. As for the Dutch tunnel connecting New York and New Jersey, it is another shortcut for traffic in both places.</p>
<p>Although New York's vehicles are so congested, the convenience of its vehicle traffic is truly astonishing. The police order the continuous flow of vehicles very quickly. From Battery Park to Fort Henry Road, the automatic opening and closing of red stop and green go vehicle traffic lights can be seen everywhere. Delays and accidents in the traffic on various streets are not commonly seen. The Times Square area in the heart of New York's theater district is the most difficult place in the world for vehicles to move through. It is only 12 blocks long and 5 blocks wide, and every night, the total number of people going to theaters and other entertainment venues is over half a million. A dance hall in a certain hotel there can hold 7,500 people. Madison Square Garden can hold over 25,000 people during major sports competitions. 96 major entertainment venues have audiences entering and exiting at the same time within the same 20 to 30 minutes every night. Recently, in order to solve this difficult situation, in these areas, parking is prohibited from 7:45 AM to 9:00 AM and from 10:30 PM onwards. In addition, rules for left and right turns at intersections have been established, and pedestrian rules have been set. Since the implementation of these measures, the speed and safety of traffic have increased by 30 percent.</p>
<p>The most difficult aspect of New York traffic is the handling of direct traffic. Manhattan Island itself is very narrow, and the usual traffic flow is already extremely congested. In addition to this, there are thousands of sightseeing vehicles passing through. A bridge building plan was created for this purpose. People from the south and west can take the northeastern route or bypass the area altogether, thus avoiding the hassle of going through Manhattan. Automobile drivers can avoid the congestion and delays of New York streets. This plan is nothing short of a blessing for travelers. But this statement is just a plan. If it is to be implemented, the current situation must be completely reformed. The current branch roads are expanded to accommodate outside vehicles. The current flat roads are dedicated to the special use of free-flowing vehicles. A two-story flat road, as wide as a sidewalk, is for pedestrians to walk on. The ground floor of large stores is used as a receiving area, and the floor is moved to the upper floor. Another suggestion for a new plane is to create an elevated avenue along the edge of Manhattan Island, from the Queensboro Bridge, east to 59th Street, and west to 72nd Street. New York's declaration of war on congested traffic began with the elevated avenue on Park Avenue at 40th Street, extending to Grand Central Terminal and through the new buildings of New York Central New House.</p>
<p>For ten years, the tall copper tower on Fifth Avenue, which used to display red and green lights to direct vehicle traffic, is now being demolished due to the needs of the times. The area where it stood has now been cleared and left with much empty space. As for the traffic lights on the tower, they have been moved to the roadside pillars to continue their work. The third step in solving traffic difficulties is the construction of a 21,300-foot elevated avenue located west of the Hudson River between Canal Street and 72nd Street. Once this road is completed, it can relieve the direct traffic of the north-south avenue. Its completion is expected in 1932. This elevated avenue has two 30-foot wide roads, which can accommodate 5,000 to 9,000 cars per hour. Its speed can be 35 miles per hour. The height is about 14 to 18 feet above the ground. This road can also be raised and lowered at intersections with important roads.</p>
<h3>How to Accept a New Car</h3>
<p>— Ding Zuzhe</p>
<p>Matters to Note</p>
<p>When a new car is shipped from the factory, the radiator and fuel tank are usually drained. In some cases, the machine oil in the oil pan is also removed. After receiving the car, check these three places and replenish any that are empty.</p>
<p>Before a new car leaves the factory, the factory personnel will install all the necessary items. However, during transportation by boat and car, loss or damage is inevitable. The recipient must not be careless and must inspect the car carefully.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there are also new cars delivered to the buyer with sufficient gasoline, machine oil, and water, and all parts complete. The buyer should also carefully inspect the car, because it often happens that a car is driven from the car dealership by its employee to the buyer's residence without any difficulty, but if the buyer does not check the car upon receipt, the purchased car suddenly develops problems upon delivery. This happens often, and it is too late to regret it afterwards.</p>
<p>The inspection procedure can be done according to the instruction manual of the purchased car. The manual lists all the included repair tools, which should be checked once to prevent any shortages. Car dealership workers often take one or two of these small tools for themselves because they are easy to carry. Buyers often do not pursue the matter because the value of these tools is not high, but they realize the importance of these small tools when they need them. The exterior of the new car should be checked for any damage, and whether the spare tire, spare wheel, or spare ring are available. Check that each light is intact and whether it can light up. In short, no small parts should be missing. What is especially important is to check whether the car brand, model, and engine number listed on the car sales contract signed by the car dealership are completely consistent with the vehicle received, in order to prevent being cheated.</p>
<p>If the new car received is disassembled from a wooden box, in addition to assembling each part, you should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>Tires: Each tire should be complete and undamaged and have enough air pressure. The spare tire should also be inflated before being hung on the car.</p>
<p>Water, Gasoline, Machine Oil: Fill the radiator with clean water. After the engine has warmed up, add a little machine oil. Fill the fuel tank with gasoline. If any overnight sediment is found, it must be drained first. Transmission parts: Check whether the machine oil stored in the transmission and rear axle housing is full. The oil plug heads in these two places can be removed. If the oil level has dropped below the position of the oil plug head, add a little machine oil until oil overflows from the hole (at the plug head).</p>
<h3>Transmission Method of Gears Engaging Simultaneously</h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>Among the many improvements of the 1931 overhead valve New Buick, the newest and most noticeable to car owners and drivers is the transmission method of gears engaging simultaneously. According to Mr. Chris (manager of the Shanghai General Motors Company), this type of transmission is only available on the most expensive cars manufactured by the American General Motors Manufacturing Plant. The smoothness and fluency of its mechanical power flow is only available in this eight-cylinder engine car. All new Buick cars (except the 8-50 model) have this feature.</p>
<p>Buick's transmission method of gears engaging simultaneously allows the first gear to be shifted to second gear and then to third gear at any speed, and reverse gear can be engaged at the same time without any conflict or obstruction. There are countless benefits, and the absence of grinding noise during operation further enhances the joy of driving.</p>
<p>The transmission with gears engaging simultaneously ensures safe driving. Drivers know that it is safer to use second gear when going down steep slopes to prevent the speed from becoming too fast and to avoid accidents. Often the height of the mountain slopes is difficult to guess. The degree of slope is not known until the actual descent. Therefore, it is most difficult to engage gears when the speed is high. A transmission with gears engaging simultaneously is essential to deal with the difficulties at that time.</p>
<p>No matter how high the car speed is, the transmission with gears engaging simultaneously can immediately return from no gear to second gear without hesitation. When in use, the driver only needs to depress the transmission pedal and push the gear lever to its original position, and the car will be easy to use. Moreover, engaging gears before departure is completely automatic and very stable, which can extend the life of the internal mechanical parts of the car.</p>
<p>The movement of the transmission with gears engaging simultaneously is extremely smooth. It can be controlled freely on various road surfaces without fear of clumsy shaking, and the speed can be increased from low to high immediately.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Speed and passengers can be unaware.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of this device is exquisite and the usage is simple, not a false assumption, and not a temporary secret. This mechanism is purely mechanical and scientific, requires no adjustment, and automatically regulates.</p>
<p>The principle of the transmission with gears engaging simultaneously is quite ingenious. Briefly, when the first gear is shifted to second gear and then to third gear, or when reverse gear is engaged, there are two rotating wheels that transmit at the same time, and the speed is equal to avoid conflict. Although ordinary transmissions also have two gears, they do not transmit at the same time. The rotation of one gear is often equal to the engine speed, and the rotation of the other gear is often the same as the car speed. During shifting, the car or engine speed must first be equal to the accelerator or brake before the gear can be engaged without bumping. From this point of view, it is really difficult for ordinary transmissions to change gears in time when driving on rough roads.</p>
<p>The gear transmits mechanical power to the gear lever on the sliding surface of the main shaft. When the gear shaft rotates, it first touches the power transmission box of the pointed cylinder and meshes tightly with the teeth of the toothed power transmission box and the rotating gear, so that the free-rotating gear has a direct relationship with the gear lever. The center of the transmission with gears engaging simultaneously is a simple pointed cylinder power transmission box that grips the rotating gear tightly and accurately. The speed of the two rotating gears. This mechanical device is extremely accurate. After the pointed cylinder power transmission box aligns the speed, the toothed power transmission box and the rotating gear follow. Working in the pointed cylinder power transmission box, after the two gears are completely merged, the pointed cylinder power transmission box automatically disengages.</p>
<p>There is no change in how to use the gears. Now, when the driver pushes the gears, he feels light, nimble, and responsive, and allows the pointed cylinder power transmission box to complete its speed matching work before the toothed power transmission box makes contact. Therefore, the previous clumsy method of engaging gears and the worry about increasing and decreasing speed can be avoided.</p>

<h3>Opening of the International Automobile Exhibition</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 16th – The 1930 International Automobile Exhibition opened today at Olympia. The variety and quality of the displays are unprecedented. Old-style automobiles from 1896 to 1913 are also on display. The new cars have lower bodies, better brakes, and sturdier construction, while prices are lower. The four-cylinder car seems to have been overshadowed by the six-cylinder car. Half of the cars on display are six-cylinder. However, a certain factory in Coventry still displays four-cylinder cars because they are more economical. There are over seventy participating factories. The United States, France, Italy, Belgium, and Germany all have products on display. British manufacturers' styles and workmanship are considered the best among family cars on display.</p>
