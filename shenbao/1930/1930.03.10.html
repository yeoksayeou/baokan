<p>時評</p>
<h3>英國政黨近觀</h3>
<p>英國工黨自執政以後始與俄國復交繼開縮軍會議英首相美洲之游爲國内所注目財長賠欵會議時之演說又爲世人所稱道轟轟烈烈方謂英國之政治舞台將爲所久據矣然至今日各政黨以久默之餘又將羣起而蹈政府之瑕矣</p>
<p>英國新成之統一黨近發表宣言有四大政綱之語而其間一條則爲對於印度不能再爲讓步是非見印度正在實行非武力反抗之時欲以此窘政府乎又如新整理之自由黨近亦聲言將以失業工人問題與政府挑戰是非見近來工業之衰頽以工黨政府不能救濟工人失業以子之矛攻子之盾乎此皆英國工黨政府身當其任而難以處置者也</p>
<p>大抵一國之政黨旣握政權而後其他政黨必即蹈瑕抵隙而來今日英國工黨之政府亦復如是故使英國之統一黨與自由黨執政權於今日印度問題與工人失業問題亦未必能有良策以應付而今則因爲工黨内閣故不能不用是以進攻苟一旦而代工黨執政權其爲工黨所攻亦復無異政黨之連環傅遞如是而已</p>

<p>决定絲價保障法</p>
<p>貴族院表示反對</p>

<p>電通社九日東京電日政府維持絲價保障法、已見决定、保障豫定額爲十五萬包、倘此後生絲市價、能維持一千二百元左右、則國庫損失約五六百萬元、日本銀行以保障案與現金政策相矛盾、對於生絲擔保放欵利息、提高爲一分七厘以上、决定避免通融</p>
<p>電通社九日東京電、對於絲價保障法貴族院方面、反對者甚多、其反對理由以生絲保障法、照第一條規定、但生絲價格對於一般經濟、異常跌落時、方可適用、至如現在、綿紗及一般物價、莫不下跌、而獨救濟生絲、殊屬不合、由此而得到利益者、並非養蠶業全體、祗爲一部分製絲家及銀行、而且過保障期間、六月十日以後、絲價能否繼續維持、殊屬疑問故云、政友會亦以絲價慘跌、爲即金解禁失敗云、現政府欲以緊縮政策、减輕國民負担、今乃以姑息偏頗救濟、使國庫支出激增、實其政策破綻云、農林省内對於通融標準過高、保障價格過多、未能保護新繭等、亦頗加非難、</p>
<p>電通社九日東京電、絲價委員會八日午後在農林大臣官邸開會、首由町田農相說明政府之絲價保障案後、即入審議委員與政府間、略有問答、旋通過政府案、五時散會、其案如下、（一）補償損失照下列條件行之（甲）照和五年六月十日止、受資金融通之生絲、如有損失、可補償之（乙）從略（二）補償損失之標準金額、担保價格、一千斤一萬二千五百元、百斤千二百五十元、加工製造者、以輸出即付匯票之金額爲準（三）担保生絲、乃照農林省指定之檢查法合格者及歸農林省指定倉庫保管者爲限（四補償損失之對方金庫、以橫濱正金銀行、中央金庫、及槿横濱神户辦理生絲匯票之銀行、經農林大臣指定者爲限、（五）關於上述以外補償法、運用之必要事項、由農林大臣適宜定之、政府俟細目通過委員會時、即發表關於補償法發動之聲明書、農林省關於此事之告示、十二日以官報公布、即日實施</p>

<h3>財政部十七年度財政報告</h3>
<p>（續）</p>
<p>鹽務本會計年度開始時、鹽稅收人甚微、鹽務行政亦珠紊亂、中央微收鹽稅之權僅及江浙皖三省、其大部分並已劃當戰費之抵押、就行政方面言、鹽務　核所在歷稱鬆泛之鹽務行政中、本可爲一统一之居間、乃積久遂爲窳敗之機關、後略經整頓、至十八年十月内戰未重起以前、其收入已可與前稽核所全盛時代相埒、此足證明使國内承平、此種機關殊有大進步之可能也、</p>
<p>稽核所服務人員、向經考試、於鹽政經騐、自較充實、國人間有異議、認稽核所爲外國債　之收欵機關、然其責任之嚴明、制度之整齊、都有值得保存者、業經十七年九月國府明令、鹽債事務、逕歸財部處理、稽核所亦同時直接受財部之指揮、其時即將全國各省稽核分所恢復、並規定各所收入、即不能掃解中央、至少應繳一定成數、俾足敷負鹽務之債額、上項規定成數實行之初、每多困難、旋即順利、在十八年一年中、償還鹽劵債額計爲九百六十萬元、迨十八年九月財部竟能宣佈不但能逐年按期攤還鹽債、並有餘力可清償舊欠矣、</p>
<p>本年度中除繳納成數辦法、已告成功外、財部亦得因中央政權之逐漸發展、將統轄區域逐漸擴張、由長江流域以至河北山東及西南各省、規定劃一稅額及徵解辦法、其各種中央地方鹽稅附加、槪歸當地稽核所徵收、並取消包商、改良緝私、至就塲徵收政策、亦在預備中、</p>
<p>以上所陳各項改革、此時皆在草創時期、其成敗皆視國内之能否停止一切軍事行動、就單純收人論、鹽政改革、確已見有成效、新制實行後收人按月增加、十八年九月總計千已逹一二百二十四萬五千元、其中百分之六十繳解中央、用以償還鹽債及支配政費、乃翌月内亂復張、交通阻斷軍的乘機大批販私、商情驚擾、稅收驟短、但就過去九月問之情形觀察、已足證明使政局安稳鹽務稅收前途未可量也、十八年七月至十二月鹽稅收入表附</p>
<p>民國十八年七月至十二月鹽稅收人表七月份　八百九十一萬五千九百三十四元八月份　八百七十三萬八千九百零八元九月份　一千二百二十四萬五千七百二十六元十月份　一千一百十五萬六千八百八十五元十一月份　九百二十六萬七千七百九十四元十二月份　七百二十萬四千七百元</p>
<p>烟酒稅　烟酒在各稅中最有改良之餘地、而徵收則最困感難、尤以酒稅爲甚、因出産銷塲區域散漫、未能集中、民間自由釀酒種烟、所在多有查察難遍、往時徵收、或係委託當地商民代理人員旣多、管理不周、偶遇兵亂匪警、稅收立見短絀、雖備具根本計畫、亦非统一實現、無從力策施行處此環境、惟有恪守現行制度、以期得步進步、但就財部現轄各省烟酒稅收觀察、經短期間改革之結果、確已顯著成績、財部並已召集委員會、以烟酒稅方面有經騐人員、並聘請有學識專家、共同組織、討論便於改進及適於施行之方案、彚訂專集、以資參考、茲將十七年起稅收比較表附後</p>
<p>烟酒稅處最近兩年收數比較表</p>
<p>年别省别　十七年十八年江蘇　一·一一三·七九○元　一·八○一·四五五元浙江　二·六一二·六二七元　二·六三五·一九六元安徽　五八三·七三七元　一·○○○·○○○元江西　二九五·四○四元六○一·○○○元　建　六二一·○四四元一·○○○·○○元○湖北　八八○·三三一元　一·二○○·○○○元山東　四二七·三七一元　一·五二六·九九二元河北　一·四四六·○五八元　二·一九○·四四二元上列十八年收入數、係實行改良之估計、就過去六個月之收入確數參證、除非因省區中域内發生戰亂、則表列之數、各省當能如額、與預算不相出入</p>
<p>印花稅本稅亦列爲重要稅收之一、非國家雷厲風行、則最大成效、無由逆覩、蓋此稅極形繁碎且係向民衆方面直接徵收、欲期立增收額殊非易事、目前祇在注重勸導官傅、以期養成普遍習慣、現定是項稅制之發展、以循下列三種爲原則（一）此項稅欵、不論現在是否師人國庫、應全國一律領用部製印花（二）取消商人包銷、一律實行粘貼（三）租界一律徵貼印花稅、以上三種事實、現已逐漸推行、當可較前進步、</p>
<p>煤油稅煤油稅當國民政府未成立以前、僅爲輕微之進口稅、收數不多、尚有各地方及敎育慈善團體巧立其他名日、徵收雜稅、厥後財部經極大之困難、並與油商及公私機關幾經商洽、始能改辦統稅、在油商方面初頗躊躇、嗣知辦法係次徵足、餘概蠲免、始肯履行、當北代軍需最急之際、曾以本稅担保發行公債、迨十七年二月海關新稅則實行後、以煤油汽油同爲舶來品、由海關徵收最爲簡當、即將本稅併入關稅内辦理、其公債基金亦由海關負擔、</p>
<p>捲菸稅當北京政府時代、除雪茄菸捲菸進口時徵值百抽五稅餐、尚有二五出廠稅及各地各省並敎育機關慈善團體各種雜稅、並有幾省因本稅收入不多、巧立公賣名目、菸業因而疲滯收益未見增加、尤以一般洋商恃租界爲護符、每不·遵從政府法令、致租界内遂成漏稅之藪、一部份華商亦復踴躍加入、迨十七年一月、財部遂與華洋各商訂定辦法、並與各省各地及機關團體經累月之磋商、始實行统稅、所有雪茄菸捲菸不論國内自製品或舶來品除進口稅外一、律徵收统稅百分之二十二·五、包括出産銷場兩稅改爲就出廠或進口時一次徵足、各商於是深信捲菸統稅之爲大公無私贊助不遺餘力、十八年一月一日起、捲菸稅又增至百分之三十二·五舶來品捲菸稅增至百分之四十、夷考從前全國捲菸特稅率爲百分之五十、而收人每月不過數十萬元、現雖内戰未已、而徵收統稅之結果、統計財部各現轄省局所解人、每月已有四百萬元、</p>
<p>東三省山西及西北西南各省尚不在内、收入激增、實爲改良各稅中之最有成績者、亦已編有捲菸統稅史專刋、茲將十八年六月至十二月收入比較列表如後、</p>
<p>民國十八年六月至十二月菸稅收入表</p>
<p>六月份　二百八十四萬零六百五十六元七月份　二百八十萬七千九百二十八元八月份　二百九十三萬一千三百二十三元九月份　三百十五萬四千四百二十六元十月份　三百六十三萬零三百十九元十一月份　四百零四萬六千二百四十六元十二月份　三百八十四萬三千六百五十八元釐金　釐金固爲弊政實施改革、自屬急務、但關係大宗收人、必須有别項稅收足以替代、方可實行、當十五年夏前任曾提議廢除、但爾時政府權力所及、祇有數省一旦撤消無可抵補因循至今現在財部對於裁釐之計畫步驟爲二（一）按政府已將士地稅劃歸各省目前各省辦理釐金、雖仍歸各省財廳主管或薦充、但撤消之權則全屬中央、已無疑義（二）籌辦合乎經濟原則之良稅、及整理原有稅收</p>
<p>當十八年六月間財部對於全國裁釐、頗有實行之希望曾擬十九年二月舉行、詎十八年九月内　又作、遂未能如預定計畫但是項需要政策未可視爲緩圖業經國府明令、定於十九年十月十日實行裁釐、其類似釐金之捐稅、並予廢除政府對此大計、係絶對抱有决心、本年十月不論財政狀况如何、必當貫澈主張、俾此種財政上相沿最苛細之弊政、及妨碍商貨流通之電物、從根本廓清、是亦足告慰於我國商賈者也</p>
<p>各稅之歸併及改良、國人未明財政實况、每有不負責任之譏評、其實我國民政府自奠都南京後、在地方上於賦稅部分或有增加、至財政部所</p>
<p>管轄之國稅、則縷指可數、非特並未創行新稅增人民之負擔、並力將各稅統籌簡單師併辦法例如各種鹽附稅機關林立、現均併人鹽務稽核所、煤油特稅及二五附稅均併人海關、雪茄菸稅捲菸稅併爲統稅、似此手續旣簡費用亦省、至郵包稅並有多人認爲新稅、實係與釐金胡關之</p>
<p>即江蘇一省本稅收入、已能超過歷來歲收三倍、麥粉稅亦係統稅性質、用以替代從前苛細之麥稅、所定稅率總額、比較以前爲低、而收入則確增高二倍以上、</p>
<p>就稅率論、亦無大變更、關稅雖見增高、然與東西各國相較尚遜、各省鹽稅間有增多、亦間有減少、爲劑其平、非加稅也、視此中央實際上絲毫未有加增稅率、而收益較有進步者、一爲中央權力範圍之擴展、一爲行政方法改良之效果、（未完）</p>

<p>墨相反對有聲電影墨西哥外相近發表宣言。對英語有聲電影。表示反對之意。謂英語實違反國民之需求。我人應起而運動排斥之。政府亦應有適當之措置今此時機已益迫云。英語在墨尚流行。猶有此影響，在華蓋可知矣。</p>
<p>紐約十一層玻璃樓紐約崇閣巍樓。高入雲際、累累相望。近名建築師又計劃一高十一級之水晶樓。全部用鐵泥爲骨玻璃爲肉。光鏡照人。别樹一幟。而八面玲瓏。尢具匠心。日京帝國旅館亦出此建築帥之擘畫。聞即將着手建造矣。</p>

<h3>輓妻長聯</h3>
<p>— 清癯</p>
<p>余友項君遠村。於今歲一月喪偶。其爲奉倩神傷。有逾恒情。蓋離鸞别鵠重賦悼亡。已兩度斷絃矣。君固長於文學、而尤擅詞曲、聞於海上。此次鼓盆興戚。其所爲悼辭。不作浮藻之華言。而出之於白話。純以語體述其夫人顧慶臣女士賢淑之美德。都一萬二千餘字。幾於一句一哭。一字一涙。令人不忍卒讀，余欲撮其嘉言懿行。以爲並世女界矜式。苦限於本談篇幅。祗得從略。特錄其挽詞一聯。以諗閱者。并藉以塞項君之悲焉。聯曰。</p>
<p>撒手何所之。念堂上雙親。賴卿侍奉。念膝下諸雛。需卿撫養。更念閫以内家常瑣屑。全仗卿主持。忍撇去這副重擔。壓我雙肩敎獨挑。人天傷永隔。每當休沐遄歸。覩弱息啼聲。稚兒號泣。遺持蛛籠。故奩蝄　。景物太難堪。對眞象。　半琖瓊漿洒兩行熱涙。空思慕齊眉模樣。任高呼阿誰娘。低唤吾的愛。總不見伊眸珠動唇吻展。仙馭回還。縱日後筆底瀉萬觔恨。杯底澆　鍾愁。衹好嚥住悲哀。怎能訴向泉台曉。</p>
<p>從頭曾細數爲辛勤過度。磨了精神。爲操勞勿輟。减了容華。尢爲孩子們哺亂提携。嘔盡了心血。致引起蕞爾毒菌。乘茲弱點施猛襲。恩義肯輕抛。無奈膏肓深入。儘服中西藥。气僊佛靈注補血液。培養氣筒。病魔反增劇。嗟藐躬。又鴛盟折毁。再圓月缺殘。生拆離比翼鸞鳳。算前妻二百日。繼配十五年。畢竟賸俺形孤單。影零丁，終宵悽愴。讓憑個幽冥裏相逢迎。姊妹行相存問。亦許憐其冷落。應待邀同萝寐來。</p>
<h3>昌明藝專觀光記</h3>
<p>— 謝玉岺</p>
<p>王一亭吳東邁兩先生創辦之日明藝術專科學校。已於日前開學。并陳列古畫及各敎授作品。公開展覽。承國畫主任王君個　之招。故於吾校中國文藝學院開學盛會中蔡孑民方娓娓演講之時逃席而出驅車造門。時已卓午。羣聚庭中。一亭先生方據案畫逹摩象揮灑風生不俄頃而西來一葉已奕奕纸上。中國近年畫事日昌。然多偏重山水花鳥。畫人物者絶罕。自吳觀老下世。瘿瓢一脈廣陵散絶、遂使白龍巋然靈光。矍鑠哉是翁佛像成後。姚虞琴吕十千相繼畫松竹。十千松成，堇叔爲題句於上。堇叔詩文卓絶。出其餘事作書剛健姠娜。兼而有之有晋人之風度。而去其側媚，得北魏之骨幹。而殺其傖荒惜長逃醉鄉。作書畫彌　矣。是日所列君書甚多。則破格也。入校第一室中。張昌老墨筆花奔四鏡屏。此吾在東邁寓中屢見而欲爲率更臥者。蓋其運筆用墨。純得古人論書龍跳虎臥錐畫沙印印泥之法、走筆則夭矯不可逆測落墨則厚重不可推移。一菘一芋。如先秦之鑄權量。吾嘗於全國美展見玉梅　所藏八大丈幅墨荷。其奇肆而端重。神妙正共此絶肖。如翁庶乎可言八大吾因又聯想及中國文藝院壁間所張曼青畫墨菜硃砂萊菔。神氣亦在乎千百年上、作畫惟此不見粉黛不多幾筆之製。最易見人本領耳。昌明樓上俱爲古代名作。吾以怱遽未登樓、然就樓下所見。已如春暮看山。青紫萬態。不必山陰道上。正自顧盼不睱。個　丹桂一幅、於樹根後以淡赭作小石。樹陽又著墨竹數竹數莖。桂與石之　芚。墨竹之挺秀。尺幅之間。胸襟畢現。詫爲觀止。水墨桃花俱以碑版法入畫、古味盎然昌老弟子不多。自師曾玉　苦李下世吾所知者。惟個竊英賓篤守師法，最可敬佩。吾曾有詩曰。個竊樸茂英賓秀。各有天才繼大聾，朋好皆以爲知言然今日未見英賓畫、殆在樓上耳。又無鍚胡汀驚聞有精品册子陳列。亦以在樓上未見僅見其廊下爲馬萬里所作四屏。汀鷺以詞人作畫酸鹹逈與人異。東邁篆隸屏。虎贲中郎。令人想見昌老。校額即爲大筆。樸厚耐人尋味。輪扁之言。臣不能喻臣之子臣之子亦不能受之於臣，藝術之事。誠非口之所能言。而吾於東邁先生之克傅家法。又疑夫子之敎其子亦有道也。可爲嗢噱。</p>
<h3>上海舞臺觀劇記</h3>
<p>— 老拙</p>
<p>四日晚觀劇於上海舞臺，入園。李慧琴正演斬窦娥。二簧慢板及快三眼兩節，腔圓味美。惜未及演法塲，諒係時間關係之故，次則高慶奎李陵碑。倒板唱來甚酣足。廻龍腔之（珠涙雙流）譚唱流字行腔一板半。至中眼接（我的兒吓）行腔兩板半。腔仍落中眼。不獨韻味　　。抑且沙漠作戰，望子心切。不禁悲從中來無限凄凉之狀况。曲曲繪出。慶奎雖未按照譚氏唱法。但其意境已到，惟（七郎兒回雁門）以下。乃唱元板。究不若快三眼之動聽。且（怕的是我的兒一命罷休）</p>
<p>罷字非唱三眼。斷難使出妙腔來，此研究戲曲者所不可不知也。反二簧（大宋扶保保字行腔六板半。一氣呵成。與碰碑時缷田丢盔之做派。俱佳。大軸徐碧雲演前世玉堂春新劇。（按是劇結穴於藍橋相會會而未成。飲恨於水鄉。似可定劇名爲藍橋恨。較切）碧雲飾蘭秀才之女蘭瑞運秀才爲媒媪所紿。將女醋配十不全之周文貴。結成惡姻緣。旋由萝神牽引與魏景元萝中歡會。次日醒來、影元特地來訪瑞蓮。二人井邊邂逅。乃訂盟於藍橋相會赴約時。兩人參商。不期爲烈風雷雨所震懾。先後投水而亡。離奇怪誔，純屬神話。全劇佈景有雷電風雨龍宫水殿山川橋樑等等。大似崇尚機括新流行之戲劇，劇中穿挿。頗有數處。足以令人解頤。碧雲所唱西皮二簧南梆子數折，腔調新頴。其歌喉之嘹亮。氣勢之貫串。已漸回復三年前之影象。是以觀者咸爲满意焉</p>
<h3>南洋遊記（二）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>十一晨六時到港、張君欲即同赴港。昨發一電與其子。乃同往九龍關訪其子。子未至。遇關員念飛烈Saw英人。年少有情、余乃赠以所著英文女政府贈之。船例三等票到坡必須護照、張君未有、竟不重上。爲之悵然。</p>
<p>下午四時開。有風。或云據醫生言。暈船者須多食。食過飽以免嘔吐。若腹空反易嘔也。未知確否。</p>
<p>睱閱手抄之西書筆記。斯巴逹止一萬人　典三十萬人。以十二村爲基礎。而成最文明之市府，今我僑在各處動以數十百萬計，惜不明此自治之文化。雅典殖民團有一最奇之俗。即不論其團之大小。甲地與乙地關係箇箇獨立自由。希拉人人不解ＴheGreerMind甲地之人可以管理乙地。乙地之何以附庸甲地。彼雖認母鄉。然僅以血统之神火分家。興文化風俗上生聯絡、而政治上無主從之關係。此爲其各市府獨立精神　大無二者也。（Myers）通史九八頁我與僑民談令後務注重團體自治爲生存要素，余在海外若有睱，當以此指導助吾僑胞耳。因余生平專門提倡村治者也，商人云，彼在缅興敎堂。我言敎堂亦可興，但興自治團。社會敎育尤爲海外互助生存命脈。不可不知也。</p>
<p>天熱。室氏華氏七十一度。已開電扇。乃换夾衣。同桌黃白種雜坐。令人有四海兄弟之思。但究竟因國界與面色之異。未免感情隔　，所好男女雜坐。又有琴聲。以供娱樂耳，念若欲致大同必定用余血統混合之策。先化除種界始矣。除以兩性爲中心調和外。他策均失敗。此余之斷論也。</p>

<h3>英國棉花消費減少</h3>
<p>美棉較上年減念萬七千包</p>
<p>猛烈跌風此實爲主要原因</p>
<p>邇者美棉跌風頗熾大有江河日下之勢、究其原因、銷費減少實爲主要、茲據英倫電告二月份提用原棉統計較諸過去兩年間爲減此以棉貨市况呆滯所致、其中美棉較一九二九年減少二十萬○七千包印棉增三萬一千包、而他種棉則增十四萬包更可見各國提倡植棉成效漸著美棉消費減少不無有相當之關係、茲將自一九二九年八月一日至一九三年一月止各廠提用原棉統計與最近兩年比較如下（單位千包）</p>

<h3>日本原棉消費概况</h3>
<p>美棉增加華棉步减</p>
<p>日本紡業逐漸進展、而原棉消費狀况亦隨之而戀遷中國棉花本居重要地位現以中國棉廠需求較大價格不復似歐戰前之低廉、更以品質關係、消費視前爲减、印棉如差價悄·超過美棉則仍爲日本所歡迎、惟日廠因印棉最良品質之退化頗以爲憾尤以明哲布美種棉之變劣爲甚故日本採用美棉有增多之越勢、現所通用者爲八分之七時織維更以漸多紡中支紗與細紗勢必多用美棉以一九一一一！一六年與一九一七！一年兩個五年之時期比較、美棉銷費增加百分之七八、印棉增百分之二五向不多用之埃及棉亦增加百分之六二、至於中國棉僅用於十上支以下之粗紗、則减少百分之四·四、至最近此種情勢益爲顯著、華棉幾不爲日人注意也</p>
<h3>日本二月份棉紗産額稍減</h3>
<p>減工率一成一二分</p>
<p>減産率祗五分有强</p>
<p>兩點頗堪加以注意</p>
<p>日本紡績職合會發表二月份日本棉紗産額計二十三萬四千一百○三包比前月減少一千二百三十三包、查二月十五日起爲日本沙廠減工實施之期其滅工率表面爲一成七分然而實際上　　成一一分然減義不過五分强珠可注意茲將生産額分别錄下</p>

<h3>National News: Yan Xishan to</h3>
<p>Convene Rehabilitation Conference</p>
<p>Representatives From All Sides Depart Taiyuan in Succession</p>
<p>Liu Puchen to Go to Shanxi to Handle Post-Conflict Issues</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from Beiping, 9th) General Yan of Beiping will convene a rehabilitation conference for Shanxi, Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from 7th) Wang Hu of Beiping told someone that Feng's decision to go abroad has long been determined, with no other concerns. Subordinates do not need to stay in vain. Whether Yan can leave immediately is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from 9th) According to a telegram from Taiyuan, Beiping, in addition to those who have already left Taiyuan, Liu Xizhong, Hu Pingzhou, Zhang Shukong, Li Xijiu, Zhao Fuchen, Hu Weisun, Pang Bingxun, Wang Jianzhong, and Li Baozong, among others, are dispirited, packing their bags, and preparing to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from 9th) Wang Jingguo of Beiping, together with Fu Zuoyi, went to the Tian Shumei Brigade under the command of Wang in Shanxi. They successively arrived in the Nankou and Changping areas from Suiyuan and are stationed there.</p>

(2) The Jin army that invaded western Shandong, including Yu Yu, has also withdrawn. A cavalry regiment of the Jin army originally stationed in Dingtao County retreated to Daokou.

During the retreat, they were extremely embarrassed, abandoning many supplies and goods. (4) Yan extracted four million from the Changlu Salt Revenue and three million from the Chongwenmen Customs Revenue for military expenses. (5) It is widely rumored here that Yan has entrusted someone in Tianjin to purchase a boat ticket to travel abroad, and his departure is not far off. (6) According to important Shanxi figures, Han Shiyong's support for the Central Government is sincere. Bai Chuan's attempt to advance into the Central Plains is unlikely to succeed. At this time, the only option is to implement the proposal to retire and go abroad to apologize to the people of the country.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>A Recent Look at British Political Parties</h3>
<p>Since the Labour Party in Britain came to power and resumed diplomatic relations with Russia, followed by the convening of the Disarmament Conference, the Prime Minister's visit to America has attracted domestic attention, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech at the reparations conference has been praised by the world. With such fanfare, it seemed that the British political stage would be dominated by them for a long time. However, today, after a period of silence, various political parties are about to rise up and attack the government's flaws.</p>
<p>The newly formed Conservative Party in Britain recently issued a declaration with four major political programs, one of which is that there can be no further concessions on India. Is this intended to embarrass the government, seeing that India is currently practicing non-violent resistance? Similarly, the newly reorganized Liberal Party has also recently stated that it will challenge the government on the issue of unemployed workers. Is this intended to use the decline of industry in recent times and the Labour Party government's failure to alleviate worker unemployment to attack the Labour Party government with its own arguments? These are all difficult issues for the British Labour Party government to deal with while in office.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, once a political party in a country holds power, other political parties will inevitably seize upon flaws and shortcomings to attack. Today, the British Labour Party government is in the same situation. Therefore, even if the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party held power today, they might not have better solutions to deal with the issues of India and worker unemployment. However, because it is the Labour Party cabinet, they cannot help but use these issues to attack. If they were to replace the Labour Party in power, they would be attacked by the Labour Party in the same way. The continuous transmission of political parties is just like this.</p>

<p>(Reuters, 8th, Ahmedabad) The Indian National Congress held a meeting today on the riverbank, with Gandhi presiding. A resolution was passed stating that Gandhi's disciples will enter prison if independence is not obtained, and that Indian freedom can be obtained through peaceful means.</p>
<p>(Reuters, 7th, Bombay) Patel published an article on the day he was detained, urging the people of Gujarat to enthusiastically welcome his imprisonment as the first person to start this war. He also said that our victory depends on non-violent resistance and the ability to sacrifice ourselves. The sooner we can cut off all relations with the government, the sooner we can achieve our goal of victory. He concluded by saying that if the government has any wisdom, it will not rashly detain a saint like Gandhi. Gandhi has issued an order for non-violent resistance volunteers to depart, planning to lead 100 people on Wednesday. However, the final list has not yet been released. Gandhi has informed the villages along the way of the proposed stopping points, hoping that the villagers will provide food and lodging.</p>
<p>(Reuters, 9th, Paris) Le Matin publishes a conversation with Gandhi, leader of the Indian National Congress, stating that he has not set any limits on the extent to which non-violent resistance will proceed. The one step that comrades must not cross is the boundary of violence. We intend to work hard and will not stop until we achieve independence, otherwise, we would rather be imprisoned. When asked about his thoughts on the Viceroy's reply to his letter (indicating that the Indian government must protect society to prevent the dangers that the victory of Gandhi's policies will cause), Gandhi replied, "I have no thoughts. My thoughts are numb, or it can be said that I deliberately do not imagine the consequences of this kind of hypothetical. Whether it is the Red Scourge, revolution, or violation of the law, none of them is worse than the current situation. We are all willing to endure it, because these disasters are often imposed on us in the name of the government and public safety." Gandhi believes that he is in danger of being arrested at any time. Gandhi has entrusted Les Sen, leader of the passive resistance movement in the Parisal district, to write to Bengal, advising the people there to eliminate their opinions and start non-violent resistance.

<h3>France Proposes the Establishment of a Mutual Guarantee Treaty</h3>
<p>Briand Meets With Stimson</p>
<p>General Public Opinion Is Not Optimistic</p>
<p>(Reuters, 8th, London) French Foreign Minister Briand invited British Foreign Secretary Henderson to lunch today. In the afternoon, the French Foreign Minister will meet with U.S. Secretary of State Stimson. According to French sources, the talks will focus on the possibility of establishing a mutual guarantee treaty between Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan. The French delegation believes that if this treaty can be concluded, the scope of naval limitations will be greater than what is being discussed at the naval conference. However, the French delegation also knows that the sentiment of the Anglo-Saxon people regarding international responsibilities will make the negotiation of their mutual guarantee treaty extremely difficult.</p>
<p>(Reuters, 8th, London) The talks between French representative Briand and British Foreign Secretary Henderson and U.S. Secretary of State Stimson are being kept highly secret. It is generally believed that France will use its proposed mutual guarantee treaty as a condition for France's naval reduction program. General public opinion is currently not optimistic because the United States has little desire to join this treaty, as the United States views this as a purely European event. It is expected that Britain will also not approve of this move. The British authorities believe that if the League of Nations, the Locarno Treaty, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact are not enough to guarantee France's security, then nothing else can be done.</p>
<p>(Telecommunications Agency, 8th, London) The British Prime Minister told a group of journalists today that the disarmament conference, due to the enthusiastic efforts and sincerity of the plenipotentiaries of various countries, has reached complete agreement on the fundamental forms and theories of how to reduce armaments. What remains unresolved is only the numbers that conform to this principle. Regarding this point, the plenipotentiaries of various countries are continuing to negotiate, and they must reach a complete and concrete understanding as soon as possible. As far as I know, the disarmament conference will be able to achieve full results and come to an end by mid-April. (Telecommunications Agency, 8th, London) The central issue currently being discussed between Japan and the United States is the compromise on the number of 10,000-ton cruisers of Rear Admiral Pratt. In essence, maintaining tactical superiority, the large cruisers equipped with a large number of six-inch guns should be limited to how many tons per ship. Regarding this matter, at yesterday's chief meeting, Japanese plenipotentiary Wakatsuki strongly advocated 7,500 tons for the American original plan of 9,000 tons.</p>
<h3>Former US President Taft Passes Away</h3>
<p>President Hoover Orders</p>
<p>National Mourning for 30 Days</p>
<p>国民社, Washington, 8th Dispatch – Former US President Taft passed away at 5:15 PM today. Taft's condition had been critical for the past two weeks.  Due to his strong constitution, there were hopes for recovery. This afternoon, the doctor examined Taft, and he exchanged pleasantries. After the doctor left, his daughter, thinking there was no cause for concern, went out for a ride. Unexpectedly, his condition suddenly deteriorated in the afternoon. When the nurse called for Mrs. Taft, he was already delirious, unable to recognize or speak. The two doctors who usually treated him were away on other calls and a different doctor was urgently called. By the time the doctor arrived, Taft had already breathed his last. Therefore, at the time of his death, only his wife, a few family members, and Dr. Hurlburt were by his bedside. His beloved daughter only returned after her father's death. As soon as the news spread, mourners gathered. President and Mrs. Hoover were the first to arrive. After paying their respects, they returned to the White House and immediately ordered a 30-day period of national mourning. The order was filled with high praise, extolling his integrity, self-discipline, and unwavering loyalty to the nation, accomplishments that no one else could match. Secretary of State Stimson, upon hearing the news, also said in English that America had lost a great man. Funeral arrangements have not yet been decided. It is expected that the body will lie in state in the Capitol or the Supreme Court, and then, in accordance with Taft's wishes, the funeral will be held at the All Saints' Church and burial at Arlington National Cemetery. The funeral is expected to be held on Tuesday. Taft's illness began at the start of the year, stemming from the stress of his duties at the Supreme Court.  This, combined with the pain of bereavement, led to illness. He initially went to Asheville for treatment, but after several weeks, there was no improvement. On the 3rd of last month, he asked his son to resign from his position as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to President Hoover. He then returned to Washington for treatment. He succumbed to his chronic illness after more than a month. In a strange coincidence, Taft's old friend and Supreme Court Justice Sanford also died suddenly today, just hours before Taft.</p>

<p>Taft was the 27th President of the United States, born in 1857 in Ohio. His father served as a Supreme Court Justice, Secretary of the Navy during President Grant's administration, legal advisor to the US government, and ambassador to Austria-Hungary and Russia. Taft was a top student at Yale University, known for his athleticism and enthusiastic participation in social life. After graduating, he became a lawyer in Ohio. From 1887 to 1890, he served as a judge in the Ohio Superior Court. During President Harrison's administration, he was a legal advisor to the US government. From 1896 to 1900, he was a professor and dean of the law school at the University of Cincinnati. In 1900, President McKinley appointed him as chairman of the Philippine Commission. On July 4, 1901, when the Philippine government was established, Taft became the first governor-general of the Philippines. In 1904, he returned to the United States and became Secretary of War. In 1906, when the Cuban Republic failed, the United States intervened in politics, and Taft became the regent of Cuba. In 1907, when the first Philippine Assembly was established, he returned to the Philippines to preside over the opening ceremony. In 1908, he was elected President. In 1913, he retired and became a law professor at Yale University. On June 30, 1921, President Harding appointed him as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Rescues Raw Silk Price Drop</h3>
<p>Decides on Silk Price Guarantee Law</p>
<p>House of Peers Expresses Opposition</p>
<p>电通社, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch – Regarding the Silk Price Compensation Law, the Japanese government has issued a statement outlining the main points as follows: Reducing production and joint storage have not been effective. The market price of raw silk continues to fall, reaching levels unseen in a decade. In addition to the 72,000 silk manufacturers and 2 million silkworm farming households, international trade is also affected. The government cannot ignore this situation. In order to stabilize silk prices and prevent instability in export trade, the government has decided to implement the compensation law. The compensation price will be considered in terms of interest and storage fees, with a standard of 1,250 yen per 100 catties, and providing financing.</p>
<p>电通社, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch – The Japanese government has decided to maintain the Silk Price Guarantee Law. The guaranteed amount is expected to be 150,000 bales. If the market price of raw silk can be maintained at around 1,200 yen, the national treasury will lose approximately 5-6 million yen. The Bank of Japan, believing that the guarantee plan contradicts its cash policy, has decided to increase the interest rate on loans secured by raw silk to 1.7% or more to avoid accommodation.</p>
<p>电通社, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch – There is much opposition to the Silk Price Guarantee Law in the House of Peers. The reason for the opposition is that the Silk Price Guarantee Law, according to Article 1, can only be applied when the price of raw silk has fallen abnormally in relation to the general economy. As for the present, cotton yarn and general commodity prices are all falling, and it is inappropriate to only rescue raw silk. The beneficiaries of this are not the entire silkworm farming industry, but only a portion of silk manufacturers and banks. Moreover, there are doubts as to whether the silk price can continue to be maintained after the guarantee period, which ends on June 10. Therefore, it is said that the Seiyukai also believes that the disastrous drop in silk prices is due to the failure of the gold embargo. The current government wants to reduce the burden on the people through austerity policies, but now it is providing complacent and biased relief, causing the national treasury's expenditures to increase sharply. This is a flaw in its policy. Within the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there is also criticism regarding the excessively high financing standards, the excessive guaranteed price, and the failure to protect new cocoons.</p>
<p>电通社, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch – The Silk Price Committee met at the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry's official residence on the afternoon of the 8th. First, Minister of Agriculture Machida explained the government's silk price guarantee plan, and then the committee members and the government engaged in some questions and answers. The government's plan was then passed at 5:00 PM. The plan is as follows: (1) Compensation for losses will be carried out according to the following conditions: (A) Raw silk that has received financing by June 10th of the 5th year of Showa (1930) can be compensated for losses. (B) Omitted. (2) The standard amount for compensating losses is 12,500 yen per 1,000 catties, or 1,250 yen per 100 catties for the guaranteed price. For processed manufacturers, the amount will be based on the amount of the export bill of exchange. (3) Guaranteed raw silk is limited to those that pass the inspection method designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and are stored in warehouses designated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. (4) The financial institutions that are eligible for loss compensation are limited to the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Central Cooperative Bank for Agriculture and Commercial, and the banks in Yokohama and Kobe that handle raw silk bills of exchange, as designated by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. (5) Regarding other necessary matters for the application of the compensation law, the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry will determine them appropriately. The government will publish a statement regarding the launch of the compensation law when the detailed items are passed by the committee. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's announcement regarding this matter will be published in the official gazette on the 12th and will be implemented on the same day.</p>

<h3>Japan, UK, and US Divide Antarctica</h3>
<p>电通社, Tokyo, 9th Dispatch – The US government has begun creating a detailed map of Antarctica and has requested the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to provide Japanese exploration records. Therefore, the European and American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has asked Lieutenant Shirase, Japan's only Antarctic explorer, to provide records. Lieutenant Shirase departed from Shibaura, Tokyo, on the Kaiun Maru 21 years ago, on November 28th of the 43rd year of the Meiji era (1910). After many hardships and near-death experiences, he was able to plant the Japanese flag in a corner of Antarctica. The valuable records from that time were destroyed in the Great Kanto Earthquake on September 1, 1923. Lieutenant Shirase then went to the home of Marquis Okuma, the president of the Antarctic exploration support association at the time, and retrieved the stored records, which he submitted to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 7th. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently forwarded them to the United States. This is a prerequisite for the division of Antarctica by Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance's Fiscal Report for the 17th Year</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>At the beginning of this fiscal year, the salt tax revenue was minimal, and the salt administration was in chaos. The central government's right to collect salt tax extended only to the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and most of it had been allocated as collateral for war expenses. From an administrative perspective, the Salt Inspectorate, which was supposed to be a unifying intermediary in the notoriously lax salt administration, had over time become a source of corruption. After some slight reorganization, by October of the 18th year, before the resurgence of the civil war, its revenue was comparable to the heyday of the former Inspectorate. This proves that if the country is at peace, this kind of institution has the potential for great progress.</p>
<p>The personnel of the Inspectorate have always been tested and are therefore more experienced in salt administration. Some people have disagreed, believing that the Inspectorate is a collection agency for foreign debts, but its strict accountability and well-organized system are worth preserving. In September of the 17th year, the National Government clearly ordered that salt debt affairs be handled directly by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, the Inspectorate was also directly under the command of the Ministry of Finance. At that time, the Inspectorate branch offices in various provinces were restored, and it was stipulated that even if the income of each office could not be fully remitted to the central government, at least a certain percentage should be paid in order to cover the amount of salt debt. In the beginning, there were many difficulties in implementing the above-mentioned percentage requirement, but it soon went smoothly. In the 18th year alone, the amount of salt bonds repaid was 9.6 million yuan. By September of the 18th year, the Ministry of Finance was able to announce that not only could it repay the salt debts annually and on schedule, but it also had the surplus to pay off old debts.</p>
<p>In addition to the success of the percentage payment method in the current year, the Ministry of Finance was also able to gradually expand its jurisdiction as the central government's power gradually developed, from the Yangtze River basin to Hebei, Shandong, and the southwestern provinces. Unified tax rates and collection methods were stipulated. Various central and local salt tax surcharges were all collected by the local Inspectorate, and the contract system was abolished, and the anti-smuggling effort improved. The policy of on-site collection is also in preparation.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned reforms are all in their initial stages at this time, and their success or failure depends on whether or not all military actions can be stopped domestically. In terms of pure revenue, the salt administration reform has indeed shown results. After the implementation of the new system, revenue increased monthly. In September of the 18th year, the total amount reached 12.2457 million yuan, of which 60% was remitted to the central government to repay salt debts and allocate government expenses. However, the following month, the civil war resumed, transportation was disrupted, and military personnel took the opportunity to smuggle on a large scale. Business conditions were alarmed, and tax revenues suddenly plummeted. However, based on the situation in the past nine months, it is sufficient to prove that if the political situation is stable, the future of salt tax revenue is immeasurable. Attached is a table of salt tax revenue from July to December of the 18th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Table of Salt Tax Revenue from July to December of the 18th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>July: 8,915,934 yuan</p>
<p>August: 8,738,908 yuan</p>
<p>September: 12,245,726 yuan</p>
<p>October: 11,156,885 yuan</p>
<p>November: 9,267,794 yuan</p>
<p>December: 7,204,700 yuan</p>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Tax</p>
<p>Among all taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes have the most room for improvement, but collection is the most difficult, especially the alcohol tax, because production and sales areas are scattered and cannot be concentrated. There is much free brewing of alcohol and planting of tobacco by the people, and it is difficult to conduct thorough inspections. In the past, collection was either entrusted to local merchants and civilians as agents. There were many personnel, and management was not comprehensive. Occasionally, in the event of military disturbances or banditry, tax revenue would immediately fall short. Although there are fundamental plans, they cannot be implemented uniformly, and there is no way to vigorously implement them. In this environment, one can only adhere to the current system in order to make gradual progress. However, based on the observation of tobacco and alcohol tax revenue in the provinces currently under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance, the results of short-term reforms have indeed been significant. The Ministry of Finance has also convened a committee, with experienced personnel in tobacco and alcohol taxes, and hired knowledgeable experts, to jointly organize and discuss plans that are conducive to improvement and suitable for implementation, and compile a special collection for reference. Attached is a comparative table of tax revenue starting from the 17th year.</p>
<p>Comparative Table of Revenue from the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Office in the Most Recent Two Years</p>
<p>Year/Province | 17th Year | 18th Year</p>
<p>Jiangsu | 1,113,790 yuan | 1,801,455 yuan</p>
<p>Zhejiang | 2,612,627 yuan | 2,635,196 yuan</p>
<p>Anhui | 583,737 yuan | 1,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Jiangxi | 295,404 yuan | 601,000 yuan</p>
<p>Fujian | 621,044 yuan | 1,000,000 yuan</p>
<p>Hubei | 880,331 yuan | 1,200,000 yuan</p>
<p>Shandong | 427,371 yuan | 1,526,992 yuan</p>
<p>Hebei | 1,446,058 yuan | 2,190,442 yuan</p>
<p>The revenue figures for the 18th year listed above are estimates based on the implementation of reforms. Based on the actual revenue figures for the past six months, unless war occurs within the provinces, the figures listed in the table should be met by each province and should not differ significantly from the budget.</p>
<p>Stamp Tax</p>
<p>This tax is also listed as an important source of revenue. Without the vigorous implementation by the state, the greatest effect cannot be seen. This tax is extremely complicated and is collected directly from the public. It is not easy to increase revenue significantly. Currently, the focus is on encouraging officials and merchants in order to cultivate a widespread habit. The development of this tax system is based on the following three principles: (1) Regardless of whether this tax is currently remitted to the national treasury or not, the nation should uniformly use stamps made by the Ministry. (2) The system of merchants contracting for sales should be abolished, and the practice of affixing stamps should be uniformly implemented. (3) Stamp tax should be levied uniformly in the concessions. The above three facts are gradually being implemented and should make progress compared to the past.</p>
<p>Kerosene Tax</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the National Government, the kerosene tax was only a small import duty, and the revenue was not high. Various local and educational charitable organizations also cleverly created other names and levied miscellaneous taxes. Later, the Ministry of Finance, after great difficulty and several consultations with oil merchants and public and private institutions, was able to change to a unified tax. Initially, the oil merchants were hesitant, but after learning that the method was to collect enough at the first instance and waive the rest, they were willing to comply. During the most urgent period of the Northern Expedition military needs, this tax was used to guarantee the issuance of public bonds. After the implementation of the new customs tariff in February of the 17th year, because kerosene and gasoline were both imported goods, it was simplest and most appropriate to collect them through customs. This tax was then incorporated into customs duties, and the public bond fund was also borne by customs.</p>
<p>Cigarette Tax</p>
<p>During the era of the Beijing government, in addition to the 5% ad valorem tax on the import of cigars and cigarettes, there was also a 2.5% factory tax and various miscellaneous taxes levied by local provinces and educational charitable organizations. Several provinces, because the revenue from this tax was not high, cleverly created a public sales monopoly, and the tobacco industry was therefore sluggish and the benefits did not increase. In particular, foreign merchants relied on the concessions as protection and often did not comply with government laws and regulations, so the concessions became a den of tax evasion. A portion of Chinese merchants also enthusiastically joined in. In January of the 17th year, the Ministry of Finance formulated methods with both Chinese and foreign merchants and consulted with various provinces, localities, and institutions for months before implementing a unified tax. All cigars and cigarettes, whether domestically produced or imported, are subject to a unified tax of 22.5% in addition to import duties, including both production and sales taxes, which are changed to be collected once at the factory or upon import. The merchants then deeply believed that the cigarette unified tax was fair and impartial and spared no effort in supporting it. Starting on January 1 of the 18th year, the cigarette tax was further increased to 32.5%, and the tax on imported cigarettes was increased to 40%. Examining the former national special cigarette tax rate of 50%, the revenue was only several hundred thousand yuan per month. Although the civil war has not ended, the result of collecting a unified tax is that the various provincial and local bureaus under the Ministry of Finance have remitted a total of 4 million yuan per month.</p>
<p>The three northeastern provinces, Shanxi, and the northwestern and southwestern provinces are not included. The sharp increase in revenue is the most successful of the various tax reforms. A special publication on the history of the unified cigarette tax has also been compiled. Attached is a comparative table of revenue from June to December of the 18th year.</p>
<p>Table of Tobacco Tax Revenue from June to December of the 18th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>June: 2,840,656 yuan</p>
<p>July: 2,807,928 yuan</p>
<p>August: 2,931,323 yuan</p>
<p>September: 3,154,426 yuan</p>
<p>October: 3,630,319 yuan</p>
<p>November: 4,046,246 yuan</p>
<p>December: 3,843,658 yuan</p>
<p>Likkin</p>
<p>Likkin is certainly a corrupt practice, and its reform is an urgent matter. However, it relates to a large source of revenue, and it can only be implemented if other taxes are sufficient to replace it. In the summer of the 15th year, the previous person in charge proposed its abolition, but at that time, the government's power only extended to a few provinces, and once it was abolished, there was nothing to compensate, so it has continued to this day. Currently, the Ministry of Finance's plan for abolishing likkin has two steps: (1) The government has already assigned land tax to the various provinces. Although the provinces are still managing likkin, which is still under the jurisdiction of the provincial finance departments or recommended personnel, the right to abolish it belongs entirely to the central government, without doubt. (2) Raise good taxes that are in line with economic principles, and reorganize existing taxes.</p>
<p>During June of the 18th year, the Ministry of Finance had high hopes for implementing the abolition of likkin nationwide and had planned to hold it in February of the 19th year. Unexpectedly, the civil war broke out again in September of the 18th year, so the plan could not be realized as scheduled. However, this necessary policy cannot be regarded as a slow-moving matter. The National Government has clearly ordered that the abolition of likkin be implemented on October 10 of the 19th year, and that taxes and levies similar to likkin be abolished. The government is absolutely determined in this major plan and will uphold its position in October regardless of the financial situation, so that this most harsh and detailed corrupt practice in finance and the impediments to the circulation of commercial goods can be fundamentally eradicated. This is also sufficient to comfort our country's merchants.</p>
<p>The consolidation and improvement of various taxes have led to irresponsible criticisms from people who are not aware of the actual financial situation. In fact, since the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing, there may have been increases in taxes at the local level, but the national taxes under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance are few and far between. Not only has the government not created new taxes to increase the burden on the people, but it has also made efforts to consolidate and simplify various taxes. For example, various salt surcharges and numerous agencies have now been merged into the Salt Inspectorate, the special kerosene tax and the 2.5% surtax have been merged into customs duties, and the cigar tax and cigarette tax have been merged into a unified tax. In this way, the procedures are simplified and expenses are saved. As for the postal parcel tax, many people also consider it a new tax, but it is actually related to likkin.</p>
<p>In Jiangsu Province alone, the revenue from this tax has already exceeded three times the historical annual revenue. The wheat flour tax is also a unified tax in nature, used to replace the former harsh and detailed wheat tax. The total tax rate set is lower compared to before, but the revenue has indeed increased by more than two times.</p>
<p>In terms of tax rates, there have also been no major changes. Although customs duties have increased, they are still lower compared to the Eastern and Western countries. Salt taxes in various provinces have sometimes increased and sometimes decreased, in order to equalize them, not to increase taxes. From this, it can be seen that the central government has not actually increased tax rates at all, and the reason for the improved revenue is due to one, the expansion of the central government's scope of power, and two, the effect of improved administrative methods.

<h3>The Labor Dispute Handling Law Passed by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>The Labor Dispute Handling Law passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 8th during its 79th session. The original text is as follows:</p>

<h3>Report of the Railway Department Advisor on Inspection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</h3>
<p>Joint Transportation Revenue Should Be Distributed Equally</p>
<p>Reduce Transportation Costs to Compete for Business</p>
<p>Economize Expenses to Develop Railway Operations</p>
<p>Menter, Advisor to the Ministry of Railways, has compiled a report on his inspection of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and submitted it to Minister Sun for review. He made several critical remarks regarding the unfair distribution of revenue from joint transportation. Excerpts are as follows: "Upon investigation, the British only account for 20% of the entire Guangzhou-Kowloon line, but insist on taking 35% of the revenue. Such a distribution is quite unfair, and the spirit of Sino-British cooperation will be impossible to realize. The Chinese side should immediately argue on principle and renegotiate. There are many precedents for the distribution of revenue from joint transportation between countries. The United States and Canada have always followed the mileage principle for fair distribution, which China can learn from. The majority of Guangzhou-Kowloon revenue comes from China. If the situation is allowed to persist without revision, the losses will be even greater. For the sake of developing the Guangzhou commercial port, the southern section of the Yuehan Railway should be connected to the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. The Guangdong government may not agree with this, fearing that the commerce and revenue of Guangzhou will be completely inclined towards Hong Kong, harming Guangzhou. However, developing Guangzhou's internal resources can make Guangzhou increasingly prosperous, and allow local products such as coal to be transported to Hong Kong for greater sales. The coal industry there has long been dominated by Japan, and the South has already suffered losses of unknown millions. If the Guangzhou government can dredge the port to allow larger modern ships to enter and exit at any time, and improve Guangzhou to become a world-class seaport, then Hong Kong's development will not harm Guangzhou. They occupy different positions and each has its own needs. If based on mileage, Guangzhou is closer than Hong Kong. If the government can properly set transportation prices, then the import and export of goods will undoubtedly concentrate on the Guangdong side. In March 1907, China and the British &amp; Chinese Corporation signed the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Construction Contract, and the construction of the railway was based on this. The contract stipulated that the British &amp; Chinese Corporation would issue £1.5 million of 5% railway construction bonds in London, which would be used for the construction of the railway and the purchase of vehicles and equipment. The railway's land, buildings, and equipment would be the primary collateral for these bonds. The British &amp; Chinese Corporation was the trustee of the creditors. The Chinese side was not allowed to build another parallel railway in the vicinity that would harm the interests of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. However, with the completion of the Guangzhou-Kowloon highway, the railway will inevitably be greatly affected. The number of train runs must be increased, and transportation prices must be in line with the highway, otherwise it will be impossible to compete with the highway. Reducing transportation prices is important, but merely changing transportation prices without economizing expenses, improving railway operations, increasing train length, and using larger locomotives to increase both revenue and efficiency is useless. The revenue in 1928 was about the same as in 1921, but expenditures had increased by about 64% compared to 1921. The main reasons for this are higher salaries and a lack of business methods for managing railway operations. The railway currently has too many redundant personnel, and spending on material purchases is not restricted. This is not an economical way to operate."</p>
<h3>The Han and Shi Armies Advance Towards Hebei</h3>
<p>The Lu, Yu, and Jin Armies Retreat</p>
<p>A correspondent in Xuzhou reports that after Yan Xishan telegraphed his resignation, the following information was received from various sources: (1) On the 6th, the headquarters of the 2nd Route Army received a telegram from Chen Tiaoyuan stating that Feng Pengzhu's Jin army stationed in Heze and Dingtao counties had retreated from Shandong province. At the same time, a dispatch from Zhengzhou stated that Sun Chu's Jin army stationed in Zhengzhou had also retreated north. Han Fuju had dispatched the 3rd Route Army and the 13th Route Army to Zhengzhou to take over the defense. It is rumored that Yan Xishan felt that the situation was unfavorable and withdrew his troops to prepare for a change of strategy. However, the Han and Shi armies, having firmly supported the central government, have not only moved to northern Henan to take over the defense but are also advancing towards Hebei. The vanguard has already reached Xinxiang, and the rest of the troops are continuing to advance. (2) Qian Zongze returned to Xuzhou from Nanjing on the evening of the 6th. According to his account, the negotiations in Nanjing and Kaifeng were extremely successful. The Han and Shi armies are transferring their defense to northern Henan to demonstrate their opposition to Yan. The vehicles previously seized by Shi will also be returned after the transportation of the troops is completed. The Longhai Railway has prepared a passenger train in both Xuzhou and Zhengzhou and will resume operations within one or two days. He will go to Zhengzhou to take over the railway bureau after the line is open. Zhang Lianjia, the former director of the Zhengzhou bureau, has telegraphed Xuzhou and will arrange to take over the situation on the western section of the line, which is excellent. (3) According to railway bureau sources, Shi Yousan's troops began moving from Shide towards Zhengzhou on the 6th and will soon head north along the Pinghan Railway. The Longhai Railway is scheduled to resume traffic between Xuzhou and Zhengzhou on the 8th. If the timeline is too tight, it will be changed to the 9th. Fu Zuoyi's Jin army stationed in Dezhou on the Jinpu Railway is currently on standby and is also showing signs of retreat. The damaged bridge in the Pingyuan area is being repaired by personnel dispatched from the Lunan station. The transportation command, which previously set up offices along the western section of the railway, has been dissolved and replaced with offices along the northern section for military transport. In summary, the situation in the north is rapidly changing. (7th)</p>
<h3>Military and Transportation in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>A correspondent in Jinan reports that the situation in northwestern Shandong has greatly improved in the past two days. Jin troops previously arrived in the Caozhou area of western Shandong. Today, the provincial government received a telegram from Dingtao County stating that the Jin troops in the county had completely withdrawn to Hebei Province on the 4th, and the area is very quiet. Regarding northern Shandong, Shi Bangfan, the deputy captain of the 2nd Aviation Team, returned from an aerial inspection and reported that there were very few Jin troops in Dezhou, but there were more at Sangyuan Station. Most of the troops were still in the Cangzhou and Dongguang areas of Hebei Province and did not appear to be advancing. When Jin troops in civilian clothes arrived in Dezhou one day, the 2nd Shandong North Garrison Detachment, commanded by Chen Kaosi, feared that it would cause misunderstandings and was ordered to transfer to Lincheng in southern Shandong. Recently, Li Songshan's brigade of the 55th Division was also ordered to move to the Yucheng and Pingyuan areas on the north bank of the Yellow River. The armored train also patrols northward every day, and the defense of northern Shandong is more solid than before. However, because the iron bridge over the Yellow River north of Pingyuan was destroyed, passenger trains to the north only run to Pingyuan. The eastern part of Shandong is as calm as ever, but the situation with Gao Guizi's troops in Zhucheng has not yet been resolved, and the 44th Division is still surrounding them. Today, the captain of the 2nd Aviation Team, Shi Bangfan, will travel to Zhucheng with pilots Zhao Jingxian and He Darong in a Curtiss airplane to distribute leaflets, urging Gao's soldiers to wake up and surrender.</p>
<p>North-south traffic on the Jinpu Railway has been interrupted since the first of this month. Trains from Tianjin only run to Lianzhen, and trains from Pukou only run to Jinan, because Fu Zuoyi's troops are stationed in Dezhou, and the iron bridge over the Yellow River north of Pingyuan has been destroyed. Since the 5th, two additional trains, numbers 90 and 2, have been added between Jinan and Pingyuan each day. The train from Jinan to Pingyuan is number 10, departing at 10:00 AM and arriving at 1:54 PM. The train from Pingyuan to Jinan is number 9, departing at 2:34 PM and arriving at 6:45 PM. Therefore, passengers heading north must walk from Pingyuan to Lianzhen to change trains, and passengers heading south must walk from Lianzhen to Pingyuan to change trains. Mail from Jinan to the north, including Pingyuan and Tianjin, travels along the Jinpu Railway. After arriving in Pingyuan, ordinary letters are delivered by land to Lianzhen to change trains. Registered express mail is sent by sea through Qingdao for caution. Newspapers from Pingjin have not arrived in Jinan in the past seven or eight days, because ships between Qingdao and Tianjin only run once a week. (March 7th)</p>
<h3>Deployment of Defenses on the Jiaoji Railway</h3>
<p>A correspondent in Qingdao reports that since the tense situation, part of the 46th Division stationed along the Jiaoji Railway has been deployed to the Jinpu Railway to set up defenses, and part has been deployed to Zhucheng to resolve the Gao Guizi situation. Only a small number of troops remain stationed in Gaomi, Weixian, and Zhangdian, which seems weak. In addition, bandit incidents have occurred along the railway recently, especially near the Yishan and Qingzhou stations, which are areas where bandits are active. In this turbulent time, a strict deployment is necessary to maintain the safety of transportation. Therefore, the Jiaoji Railway authorities have consulted with Chen Tiaoyuan. In addition to Chen's plan to deploy troops along the railway soon, the railway has also developed a sound security plan. As for the security team, the 3rd team is stationed in Qingdao, the 2nd team is deployed between Qingdao and Weixian, and the 1st team is deployed between Weixian and Zhangdian. Another team of police and security guards is dispatched on a specially prepared train with an armored car attached, equipped with two heavy artillery pieces and two machine guns, patrolling the entire railway. As soon as a bandit incident occurs, they can immediately go to suppress and search. If a bandit incident occurs in any section, 500 or more people can be assembled within two hours. More than 400 people can also be dispatched from Qingdao. In addition, Chen Tiaoyuan's unified armored train is helping with the patrol, so the temporary defense of the Jiaoji Railway is extremely solid. Even if there is a small bandit incident, it will not be difficult to suppress it immediately. As for Qingdao, since Ma Hongkui's troops were transferred to Anhui, the city's security is temporarily maintained by the police, and the outside of the city is maintained by the security team and the Northeast Marine Corps. The naval marine corps has also stationed a battalion of soldiers in Jimo and Chengyang. The naval security is maintained by the Haiqi, Haichen, Yongxiang, and Dinghai warships patrolling the sea.

<h3>Ma Hongkui Arrives in Anhui with Wang Zhijue</h3>
<p>Wang Has Assumed the Post of Civil Affairs Commissioner</p>
<p>A correspondent in Anqing reports that Ma Hongkui, the commander of the 11th Army, has been expected to arrive in Anhui for a long time, but it has not happened. Recently, the provincial government specially sent a representative and ordered the Anfeng special ship to go to Nanjing to welcome him. However, because Ma had many followers, the Anfeng could not accommodate them, so he and the newly appointed provincial committee member and Civil Affairs Commissioner Wang Zhijue took the Hongan and Dexing ships from Nanjing on the 5th. Bao Gongren and Tan Shengbing, the welcoming representatives sent by the provincial government, returned to Anhui first on the Anfeng special ship at noon on the 6th. Zhang Anshi came with Ma and Wang. After receiving a telegram in advance, the provincial government sent a military band to the Yangtze River to wait. Soon, the representatives of the Party and government committees, various people's organizations, the staff of the 11th Army Headquarters, the Muslim community, and the military and police forces gathered at the riverbank, no less than several thousand people. Because the Hongan ship was small, the 11th Army Headquarters asked the welcoming personnel from all walks of life to gather at the Merchants Wharf outside the South Gate to wait. At 9:00 PM, the Dexing ship carrying Ma and Wang finally arrived in the province and docked at the Merchants Wharf. The drums and firecrackers were extremely enthusiastic. Ma then instructed his followers to inform the welcoming personnel to elect representatives to meet him. Ma shook hands with the representatives one by one and then went ashore to rest at the Merchants Grand Theatre near the wharf, met with the welcoming representatives, and delivered a speech, saying, "I am ashamed and unworthy of your warm welcome. Please return quickly. Because of the short notice tonight, I cannot leave the ship. I will enter the city tomorrow morning, and I will have a long conversation with you when I have time." After speaking, Ma returned to the Dexing ship with Wang Zhijue to rest, and the welcoming personnel from all walks of life dispersed. At 7:00 AM on the 7th, Ma and Wang went ashore and entered the city to meet with Acting Chairman Cheng Tianfang of the provincial government, and they talked for a long time. Ma decided to station the 11th Army Headquarters in the provincial government (the former governor's office). Wang went to the Civil Affairs Department at 12:00 noon to take over the post and, in accordance with Article 3 of the organization outline of the Autonomy Preparatory Office, received the office. He will take an oath after the central government appoints a supervising committee member. (March 7th)</p>
<h3>The Gan Army Defeats Communist Bandits in Jishui</h3>
<p>Five Brigades of the Jiangxi Anti-Bandit Forces</p>
<p>Another Communist Party Organization is Cracked Down in Jingde</p>
<p>A correspondent in Nanchang reported on the 6th that the communist bandits Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue, with a total of four to five thousand men, were uniting to try to capture Jishui and Ji'an. Fortunately, the brigades of Cheng Guangyao, Zhu Yaohua, Tang Yunshan, and Zhang Xingren fought hard and the bandits were not successful. According to telephone calls from Zhangshu and Xingan, Tang's brigade suffered a defeat in Zuobu, Jishui and temporarily retreated to Jishui city to await reinforcements. Unexpectedly, Zhu's bandits led two to three thousand bandits with more than two thousand guns to encircle Jishui City on the evening of the 1st, hoping to cut off traffic on the Gan River and Ji'an's response. Tang's brigade closed the city and defended it, and sent urgent telegrams to Zhang's and Cheng's brigades. On the 2nd, Cheng's brigade sent a part of its force from Ji'an to provide reinforcements. Zhu's brigade ordered Yi's regiment to advance from Yongle to Jishui at dawn on the same day. They arrived at the county seat at 7:00 PM and, with the Tang brigade inside, launched a joint attack to defeat Zhu's bandits. Most of the bandits have retreated to Fudu market. The provincial government is still worried that the troops there are too weak and has ordered Deng Ying's brigade, which set out to western Jiangxi, to advance to Jishui as quickly as possible. Peng, the county magistrate of Xiajiang, reported in a telegram (1) The entire Li regiment of Deng's brigade arrived in Xiajiang at Shenshi (3-5 PM) today, and Wang's regiment will also arrive on the day after tomorrow. (2) The special service battalion of the 18th Division must wait for Wang's regiment to arrive in Xiajiang to take over the defense before it can return to the province. (3) Except for those stationed in Xiajiang, Wang's regiment and the rest of Deng's brigade will advance to Jishui with Li's regiment. (4) After Yi's regiment of Zhu's brigade moved into Jishui, Zhu's bandits were defeated again and fled to Fudu Market. They are being pursued. In total, there are currently five brigades, about ten regiments or more, engaged in bandit suppression in western Jiangxi. Division Commander Zhang recently applied to the General Headquarters in Nanjing for two aircraft to be dispatched to Jiangxi Province. They will arrive in the province soon and fly to western Jiangxi to assist in the suppression, which should be able to eliminate the bandits in one fell swoop. In addition, Yingde Town in eastern Jiangxi, a famous porcelain-producing area with more than 100,000 workers, recently cracked down on a communist party organization once. According to a report from the county magistrate of the county, Li Juede, another communist bandit organization was cracked down and more than 30 communist bandits were arrested.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Province Schedules the Burning of Hailong Heroin</h3>
<p>A correspondent in Shenyang reports that the Japanese store Iinuma Shoten transported 120 packages of Hailong heroin by mail. The post office seized it and negotiated, and the provincial government organized a Destruction Committee and appointed Chen Wenxue and seven others as members, ordering them to prepare for the destruction as soon as possible. The committee has now drafted destruction methods and is scheduled to publicly burn the heroin in the public sports field on the 10th of this month. This has been reported to the provincial government for approval. The methods are recorded below: (1) Location: Xiaohoyan Public Sports Field. (2) Equipment: A brick-and-ash incinerator in the field, to be burned with kerosene and firewood.

<h3>Measures for the Aftermath of Hailar</h3>
<p>Businesses Have Fully Resumed Operations</p>
<p>The Province Has Agreed to Compensate for Losses</p>
<p>A correspondent in Harbin reports that Hailar suffered extremely heavy losses when Russian troops invaded. Although order was restored early on, the city's vitality was severely damaged and businesses had not resumed operations. Recently, with the sincere persuasion of local government officials and the chamber of commerce, and the promise that the provincial government would help with the aftermath, businesses completely reopened on the 1st of this month. Approximately 117 businesses remain in the old city, and only 24 in the new city. As for the chamber of commerce's request to the government for aftercare measures, a total of seven items have been approved by the authorities. The measures are as follows: (1) Ask the province to send a committee to investigate the losses of each business. (2) Please exempt national taxes for five years to ease the people's difficulties. (3) Provide loans subsidized by the province, interest-free and repayable in installments. (4) The funds advanced by the Hulunbuir Relief Association to aid refugees last year should be returned by the provincial government to reduce the burden. (5) The funds advanced by the chamber of commerce for goods purchased by the stationed troops should be repaid by the government. (6) Gather merchants and residents along the border and send them back to the border posts to secure their places and livelihoods. (7) Please postpone the repayment of foreign debts owed by Hailar businesses. (March 2nd)</p>

<p>Important News 2</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Cross the Border to Arrest People in Harbin</h3>
<p>The Diplomatic Office Has Lodged a Protest</p>
<p>A correspondent in Harbin reports that the Japanese consulate police in Harbin have increased to 40, plus several detectives, since the Eastern Railway Incident on July 10th of last year. They have been very active in their activities, but because their work is secret, there has been no obvious conflict with our administration. However, recently, when the anti-Japanese movement of Korean residents occurred, the Japanese police did not notify our side and often carried weapons into our streets and markets to search and arrest people. At the end of last month, the Japanese police openly carried weapons and arrested people outside the district. The Binjiang Public Security Bureau specifically reported this to the diplomatic office, which protested to the Japanese consul in Harbin. The Japanese consul Yagi replied that it was the police's responsibility to arrest Japanese bandits and strongly defended the text of the protest. After receiving the reply, the diplomatic office replied with an official letter No. 214 yesterday, arguing on the basis of reason. The letter stated, "Your Excellency's official letter No. 15 has been received and noted. It is difficult for your country's police to exercise their powers in the interior of our country. Even if there are bandits of our nationality, they should be arrested and escorted by the Chinese police. However, the Japanese police were dispatched with weapons and entered our interior to arrest people themselves, which is an infringement of our sovereignty. To avoid misunderstandings between the two sides, this director hopes that your country's police will be restrained and will not engage in such behavior in the future. We regret that the protest of this office was not accepted in the incoming letter. We solemnly declare to your Excellency again that if your country's police carry weapons to the streets again in the future, and if they fail to deal with the bandits, or even if major unfortunate events occur, your Excellency will be fully responsible."

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Develops Northeast Commerce</h3>
<p>Dispatching Councilor Liu to Harbin to Investigate the Situation of the Oil and Grain Industry</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Liu Kui, a councilor of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government and a member of the National Tariff Commission, arrived in Harbin on the 26th.</p>
<p>Local oil and grain merchants went to the station to welcome him. On the 27th, Liu visited major oil mills and grain depots in the port. At 5:30 PM, he attended a general welcome meeting held by oil and grain merchants in northern Manchuria. Liu delivered a very lengthy speech on the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's measures to assist the oil and grain commerce of Northeast China. On the 28th, he continued to visit various oil and grain factories and stores, and planned to leave Harbin on the 1st to return to Nanjing. Liu's visit was at the behest of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to investigate the situation of the oil mills and grain industry in Northeast China. In recent years, the oil mill industry in Northeast China has had difficulty sustaining its business due to sluggish sales to Europe. There are over 300 oil mills throughout the three eastern provinces, not including the grain industry. European merchants only purchase soybeans produced in northern Manchuria as raw materials, and refuse to purchase soybean oil and soybean cake because they consider the quality impure. The oil mill industry sent representatives to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to approve an increase in the export tax on soybeans to restrict the export of raw materials, and on the other hand, to reduce the tax rate on soybean oil and soybean cake to encourage their production. The Executive Yuan decided on a plan of action at its 51st meeting, but fearing that its sudden implementation would cause problems with foreign tariffs, Liu was dispatched to conduct a detailed investigation, and a decision will be made after his report. I visited Liu at the Oil and Grain Association at 5:00 PM on the 27th. According to Liu, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has the following specific ideas for revitalizing the oil and grain industry in Northeast China: "Harbin is an important town in the Northeast. Its commerce, economy, and agricultural products are all located in a central position. In recent years, foreign forces have gradually invaded the interior, and the state-run commerce has undergone changes. The central government pays extreme attention to the development of the Northeast, especially the necessity of Harbin's industrial competitiveness. The Ministry has previously received reports from the oil and grain industry, and the Ministry has discussed them in detail. Minister Kong hopes that the oil and grain industry will (1) unite and increase its position in international trade, (2) improve manufacturing methods and process products, and (3) labor and capital will work together and support each other. Currently, because tariffs are not fully autonomous, Chinese merchants have virtually no trade with foreign countries. Minister Kong hopes that the oil and grain merchants in the Northeast will unite and work together to deal with foreign countries, and strive for a position in the international commercial arena. At present, the raw materials of soybean oil and soybean cake are impure, and the manufacturing methods are not refined, which affects exports. Minister Kong hopes that new methods will be studied and processed and transformed. When necessary, the central government will set up an inspection bureau at an appropriate location. All processed products will be inspected before being shipped out. However, this matter involves the central administrative system and local power. The central government cannot directly set it up, nor is it convenient to let the local government handle it, which would disrupt the administrative system, so a decision has not yet been made. Labor and capital in the Northeast have always been extremely estranged. This is also because the organization of capitalists in the Northeast is fundamentally different. For example, Northeast banks often engage in side businesses, and have never understood how to support production or provide assistance to labor, which has led to the abnormal development of capital operations. The success of large-scale industry often depends on the assistance of capitalists. Northeast commerce is under the pressure of foreign forces, and there is little room for expansion. As far as the oil and grain industry is concerned, it is on the verge of extinction. Assistance is urgently needed. Therefore, Minister Kong sincerely hopes that both labor and capital will work together and make progress together."</p>
<h3>Japanese Observations on the Construction of Huludao Port</h3>
<p>Fearing Impact on the South Manchuria Railway and Dalian Port</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch: Since the Huludao port construction issue began two years ago, the draft loan agreement with the British, French, and American banking consortiums has not been fulfilled due to various reasons. This time, as a result of the meeting between the representative of the Dutch banking company and the Dong Province authorities, an agreement was established with the Beining Railway Bureau taking the lead. All engineering materials and expenses will be advanced by the company, and the construction period will be limited to one year. As soon as this news reached the ears of the Japanese, it immediately aroused great attention. Everyone believed that after the completion of Huludao port, the income of the South Manchuria Railway and the position of Dalian port would suffer a blow, which became the focus of discussion for a time. Summarizing the views of all parties, there are roughly two factions: optimistic and pessimistic. The optimistic faction believes that the island's terrain can only accommodate a handling capacity of 3 million tons of cargo. Of these 3 million tons, 1.5 million tons are for coal exports, and only 1.5 million tons are for the handling capacity of general import and export cargo. Compared to Dalian port, which can accommodate 10 million tons, it is like a small wizard compared to a great wizard. Moreover, this island is not an ice-free port, so it is really not a problem. The pessimistic faction believes that the construction of Huludao port with a capacity of only 3 million tons is still uncertain. According to the South Manchuria Railway's investigation, it is only based on the natural terrain, and without special facilities, it is impossible to construct a port with a capacity of more than 3 million tons. However, if special facilities are built, it is not impossible to construct a port with a capacity of more than 3 million tons. Moreover, although this port is not an ice-free port, if there is icebreaker equipment, there will be no problem at all. After the completion of the port, the South Manchuria Railway encirclement railway, which is currently under development by the Chinese side, will have access to a seaport. A large amount of cargo currently transported by the South Manchuria Railway will be taken away, and the future is difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>According to the Chinese side, the South Manchuria Railway encirclement line has three lines. The first line is Huludao-Dahushan-Tongliao-Kaitong-Harbin-Hailun Line. The second line is Huludao-Dahushan-Tongliao-Taonan-Qiqihar-Daheihe Line. The third line is Huludao-Dahushan-Fengtian-Hailong-Jilin-Yimianpo-Fangzheng-Yilan-Tongjiang Line (and Jilin-Harbin-Hailun Line). In the first line, the section from Huludao to Tongliao was fully opened in late October last year, and the other sections have also been surveyed and completed. In the second line, only the section between Tongliao and Taonan needs to be completed to directly open to Qiqihar. In the third line, the section from Hailong to Jilin is under construction, and the section from Jilin to Huludao has been fully opened. If we measure the distance from Huludao and Dalian as base points to Fengtian, the distance between Fengtian and Dalian is 249 miles, and the distance between Fengtian and Huludao is 179 miles. Dalian is 70 miles farther than Huludao. Furthermore, if we take Tongliao, the end point of the Datong Line, as the center, and compare the distance to Dalian and Yingkou on the South Manchuria Railway line with the distance to Huludao and Hebei on the Chinese railway line (the following units are miles): Dalian 490.9, Yingkou 267.9, Huludao 354.1, Hebei 246.7. Yingkou is 21.2 miles farther than Hebei, and Dalian is 136.7 miles farther than Huludao. Moreover, the power of the Datong Line can be extended to the vicinity of Sipingjie on the South Manchuria Railway line and Bamiancheng on the Sitao Line. Therefore, after the completion of Huludao port, coupled with the active development of the South Manchuria Railway encirclement line, it is not impossible that the South Manchuria Railway will be in great danger as a result.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>

<h3>Telegrams</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Anyuan Ping Mining Management Office</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao: We have read the urgent telegram in your newspaper on February 18 regarding the accusation of malfeasance against the Ping Mining Commissioner. We were shocked and surprised. Commissioner Xiao Jiamo has been ordered to manage the Ping Mining for several months now. He has spared no effort in consolidating and maintaining the mining affairs, maintaining his integrity and self-discipline, and being open in everything. This is well known and believed by all employees. How could there be a situation in which crimes are listed and petitions are filed to Beijing and the province for investigation and prosecution? Moreover, the telegram stated that more than 6,000 employees jointly filed a complaint. Why haven't we heard of it? It is obviously a slanderous act by a villain who wants to destroy our mine, deliberately fabricating facts and confusing public opinion. We have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice, so we dare to telegram you to correct the situation and beg you to publish it in the special telegram column in order to clarify the truth. We will be very grateful. Ling Shanyong, Zhou Zuogong, Zou Guyu, Wu Guo (Secretaries), Liu Cheng, Liu Yuesheng (Auditor), Zhou Daolong, Li Tang, Chen Hehu, Gu Shoushan (Engineers), Fu Pinjian, Huang Guozhen (Cooperative Business Instructors), Xiao Licheng, Li Mouyou, Li Dezhao, Zhang Keyang, Lin Zhenxin, Wu Guoxiang (Section Chiefs), Zeng Jun (Mining Police Bureau), Qiu Chubao (Hospital), Ling [illegible]yong (Elementary School Principal), and all employees of the Jiangxi Provincial Government Ping Mining Management Office respectfully pay their respects.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Requests Preservation of Historical Materials</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward it to the National Government, ordering all provinces, counties, and cities nationwide to preserve relevant historical materials and archives in order to emphasize cultural heritage. The National Peking Research Institute stated in its letter that the old archives stored in various provinces, counties, and cities are extremely important historical materials. If special preservation measures are not taken, there is a deep concern that they will be lost or destroyed over time. The institute requested that the Executive Yuan forward a request to the National Government, ordering all provinces, counties, cities, and agencies to properly preserve existing archives, or hand them over to academic institutions for preservation and organization, and that they should not be destroyed at will. Upon review, the files of various provinces, counties, and cities are of great importance to regulations, systems, and cultural relics. All materials that can serve as historical resources should be compiled into catalogs and carefully preserved. The institute's request is well-founded. Therefore, the original letter and document are submitted to the Executive Yuan to be forwarded to the National Government, ordering all provinces, counties, cities, and agencies nationwide to comply with and implement it for public convenience.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Reports on the Preparation of the Central Education Museum</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education reported to the Executive Yuan on the preparation of the Central Education Museum and requested that the museum's budget be approved and transferred to the Ministry of Finance for allocation in order to proceed with the project. The report is as follows:</p>
<p>According to the Executive Yuan's Order No. 2204, the National Government entrusted the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session regarding the consolidation and development of national education, instructing compliance. Apart from submitting a separate report on the general situation of compliance, the second item of the case is to establish an education museum in the capital, complete by the spring of the 19th year of the Republic. The deadline is approaching, and all construction work has yet to commence. The main reason is that the project is quite large and requires a significant amount of funding. Due to the frequent military operations in the past six months, the national treasury has not been able to provide sufficient funds to complete it as scheduled. The detailed preparations are as follows: (1) Regarding the preparatory organization: After receiving the order, the Ministry held a ministerial meeting in September of the 18th year of the Republic to determine the organizational outline of the Central Education Museum Preparatory Committee. Due to the large scope and unaffordable expenses, the preparatory work was temporarily handled by the responsible department. (2) Regarding construction: The site of the Central Education Museum was previously designated as the Chaotian Palace in Hanximen, this city, as the construction base. Personnel were sent to survey the land and the Nanjing Special Municipal Government was requested to transfer nearby public land for application. Engineering experts were hired to design and formulate construction plans and draw up various architectural drawings. The Chaotian Palace is planned to be repaired in accordance with its original form in order to preserve China's original art. The main part of the construction includes the Provincial Achievement Exhibition Hall, etc. Six copies of the attached drawings are submitted for reference. As for the picture gallery, it will be designed according to the latest architectural drawings, which are still being organized. Other facilities such as the sports field, gymnasium, swimming pool, sports equipment room, education equipment specimen room, lecture hall, etc., will be continued after the initial construction plan is completed. (3) Regarding the collection of statistical tables: In addition to the separate orders from the Ministry to various provinces or special municipalities to collect widely, the exhibits from the Education Hall of the West Lake Exposition have been selected for retention, and it is planned to retain a portion of the exhibits from the competition after they are displayed, in order to form a grand view. (4) Regarding the purchase of educational books, instruments, and specimens from various countries: There are many types of educational books, instruments, specimens, and educational supplies in various countries, and it is difficult to collect them comprehensively without substantial funds and a considerable period of time. Therefore, it is planned to purchase a portion at the beginning of the establishment and then gradually add to them year by year for easier progress. (5) Regarding the organization of the Central Education Museum: The organizational scope is planned to be based on the complexity of the museum's affairs. Currently, it is planned to temporarily divide it into five groups: General Affairs, Education Achievements, Library, Instruments and Specimens, and Promotion. Additional groups will be added as the museum's affairs expand. (6) Regarding the budget: The Central Education Museum is the center for reference and research for the national education sector, so the content must be rich and the scale must be grand. However, fearing the current financial difficulties of the country, the huge expenses required for this may not be easy to bear. After repeated consideration by the Ministry, a minimum budget has been set in order to implement it. At present, the central government is vigorously implementing political training and actively focusing on construction work. The Third Plenary Session has also opened. This important institution is of great importance to national education and culture, and should be completed as soon as possible. In accordance with the aforementioned directive, the Ministry is submitting a report on the preparations for the Central Education Museum over the past six months, together with a report on the survey of the museum site, an overview of the construction plan, a copy of the cost estimate, six copies of the architectural drawings, and two copies of the organizational outline, requesting review and approval for record, and requesting that the budget be approved and transferred to the Ministry of Finance for allocation in order to facilitate the project for the public good.</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi Invents Fighting Ball Field</h3>
<p>Grand Opening Performance Today at 3 PM</p>
<p>Welcome to All Circles to Visit</p>
<p>Committee Member Chu Minyi is a great scholar in our country and is not only a health expert but also a sports enthusiast. He has always advocated political hygiene and the scientificization of sports. In the past, Mr. Chu invented Tai Chi Chuan push-hand equipment and various ball sticks based on scientific principles to implement national hygiene. Mr. Chu is not satisfied with this. Recently, after thinking and gaining insights, he invented a fighting ball field, which has been completed. After several trials, the results are excellent. In order to promote public health, Mr. Chu has scheduled the opening ceremony of the fighting ball field from 3 PM to 5 PM today at the playground of the Sino-French National Vocational School of Engineering, No. 1195 Lafayette Road, and will perform various push-hand equipment and fighting balls. Invitations have been widely sent to welcome people from all walks of life to come and watch. It is said that Mr. Chu also plans to bring the above-mentioned equipment to several countries and display them in the Chinese Education Pavilion at the World Expo for the world to see. It is expected that today's viewers will compete to be the first, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Four University Basketball Game Today</p>
<h3>Shanghai vs. Soochow</h3>
<p>4 PM at the Jiang Gym</p>
<p>Today is the final act of the four university basketball game. Shanghai will play against Soochow. The game will start at 4 PM. The referee is Smith. Shanghai is clearly in a dominant position under the recent circumstances, and it is likely that they will continue to win the championship. Therefore, today's players will be more energetic than before. The only concern is that Soochow's talents may make a surprising move. If this is the case, then the championship will be divided equally between the two teams.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality's First City Games, all registrations, as early as this month's 5th deadline, the original plan was from the 13th to the 16th, now because of the variety of events and one person participating in several competitions, the number of participants is mostly from schools such as basketball, volleyball, soccer, baseball teams, and many of their players have conflicts, such as when scheduling the order, if not careful, some will give up the right to participate. In addition, the venue and dates are further restrained by the Shanghai Basketball Association and the various competitions of the Chinese and Western soccer associations. Although it has been discussed and approved by the National Sports Association to change the various competitions of the Shanghai Basketball Association on the 13th, 14th, and 16th, the distribution of order still has regrets that it cannot be completely satisfactory. Therefore, the Games will be extended to the 18th. The schedule is disclosed in advance for the convenience of the audience and to allow the registered teams and individuals to be prepared.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Traveler</p>
<p>Son—Father, why does every painting have to be framed?</p>
<p>Father—To give the painter a restriction, so he can't just casually paint whatever he wants.</p>
<p>Child (to his sister's lover)—Yesterday, I heard my sister say that you are the most handsome young man on this street. Young man—Child, don't be a gossip. That's not right.</p>
<p>Child—But my sister secretly gave me two dimes, specifically telling me to say that to you.</p>
<p>A stingy husband (walks into a new clothing store)</p>
<p>—Excuse me, can you do me a favor? Store clerk—What is it? Just say it.</p>
<p>Stingy husband—Please temporarily remove the fashionable clothes in the window display along the street.</p>
<p>Store clerk—Why?</p>
<p>Stingy husband—Because I'm going to pass by here with my wife in a moment.</p>
<p>Man—My love, are you superstitious?</p>

<h3>Overseas Tea Talk</h3>
<p>— Huang Tianpeng, from Tokyo</p>
<p>Huang Tianpeng, from Tokyo: The Stockings of Female Staff at the Disarmament Conference The Disarmament Conference is currently being held in London. When the American delegates arrived in England, the female typists among the staff were heavily made up and dressed in dazzling silk and satin. The English counterparts looked at each other and said, "With such elaborate attire, only a famous beauty in England would dare to wear it without shame. The expensive stockings of the beautiful female staff would be ruined in half an hour if we wore them."</p>
<p>Mexican Foreign Minister Opposes Talking Films The Mexican Foreign Minister recently issued a declaration expressing opposition to English-language talking films, saying that English is against the needs of the people. "We should rise up and boycott them. The government should also take appropriate measures. The opportunity is becoming more pressing." If English, which is still prevalent in Mexico, has this impact, it is easy to imagine the situation in China.</p>
<p>New York's Eleven-Story Glass Building New York's towering buildings reach into the clouds, looming one after another. Recently, a famous architect planned an eleven-story crystal building. The entire structure will use steel and cement for the frame and glass for the facade, reflecting light and creating a unique style. It will be exquisite and ingenious in all directions. The Imperial Hotel in Tokyo was also designed by this architect. It is said that construction will begin soon.</p>
<p>French Soldiers Fire on Locust Swarm In Wulanqia City, Morocco, on the afternoon of January 16th, a large swarm of countless locusts suddenly appeared, covering the sky. The streets, buildings, dining halls, and tea shops were covered with them. Diners and drinkers fled in droves, and the whole city was in an uproar. The French expeditionary force was forced to dispatch two companies to fire on the locust swarm in the air. The locusts were no match and suffered many casualties. They retreated in the evening.</p>
<p>Mussolini, Enemy of Women Mussolini, leader of the Fascist Party and Prime Minister of Italy, once said in a speech that women are unreliable and strongly denigrated them. The wife of the British Chancellor of the Exchequer heard this and was not convinced, saying that it was regrettable that Mr. Mussolini, as the Prime Minister of a country, uttered such insulting words against women. Recently, a British newspaper published an article refuting his statement, calling the Fascist Party an enemy of women. The words were provocative, and it is expected that Mussolini will come out to defend himself. The outcome is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Elegy for Wife - A Long Couplet</h3>
<p>— Qingqu</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Xiang Yuancun, lost his wife in January of this year. His grief was more than ordinary. He has already mourned the loss of his wife twice. He is skilled in literature, especially in lyrics, and is well-known in Shanghai. This time, with the grief of losing his wife, he wrote an elegy, not with flowery words, but in vernacular, purely using spoken language to describe the virtuous qualities of his wife, Ms. Gu Qingchen. It is more than 12,000 words long, almost a cry in every sentence and a tear in every word, making it unbearable to read. I wanted to extract her good words and deeds as an example for women in the world, but I am limited by the length of this article. I can only briefly mention it. I specifically record a couplet from his elegy to those who read it, and also to relieve Mr. Xiang's sorrow. The couplet says:</p>
<p>Where have you gone? I think of your parents at home, relying on you to serve them. I think of the children under your knees, needing you to raise them. I also think of the daily chores within the home, all relying on you to manage. How can you bear to leave this burden on my shoulders alone? People are forever separated. Whenever I return home on vacation, I see the weak children crying and wailing. You left behind your spider cage, your old boudoir, the scenery is too unbearable. Facing the truth, I pour half a cup of wine and shed two lines of hot tears. I only miss your eyebrow-to-eyebrow appearance. I loudly call your name. I softly call my love. I can't see your eyes moving or your lips smiling. Your immortal chariot has returned. Even if I pour out ten thousand pounds of hatred in my pen, I can only swallow my sorrow. How can I tell you in the afterlife?</p>
<p>From the beginning, I have carefully counted your hard work and exhaustion, which has worn out your spirit. For your tireless labor, your beauty has faded. Especially for your care for the children, you have exhausted your heart and blood. This caused a small bacterium to take advantage of your weakness and launch a fierce attack. Our kindness and righteousness cannot be easily abandoned. Helplessly, the disease has penetrated deep into your body. Despite taking Chinese and Western medicine, using Buddhist and immortal energy to replenish your blood and cultivate your breath, the disease has worsened. Alas, my humble body, and our marriage has been broken. The round moon is broken and incomplete. Living creatures are torn apart. Counting 200 days with my first wife, and 15 years with my current wife, in the end, I am left alone and lonely, feeling miserable all night long. Let's meet in the afterlife, and the sisters greet each other. Perhaps pitying my loneliness, you should invite me to sleep together.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Changming Art School</h3>
<p>— Xie Yuling</p>
<p>The Changming Art School, founded by Mr. Wang Yiting and Mr. Wu Dongmai, has opened recently. Ancient paintings and works by various professors are on display for public exhibition. I was invited by Mr. Wang, the director of Chinese painting, so I escaped from the grand opening ceremony of our school, the Chinese Literature and Art College, while Cai Yuanpei was giving a speech, and drove to the school. It was already noon. People gathered in the courtyard. Mr. Yiting was painting a portrait of Dharma, wielding his brush with ease. In a moment, a leaf from the West was vividly depicted on paper. In recent years, Chinese painting has become increasingly prosperous, but it mostly focuses on landscapes, flowers, and birds. There are very few people who paint figures. Since the death of Wu Guanlao, the legacy of Ying Piao has been lost. This makes Bai Long stand out. How vigorous is this old man! After the completion of the Buddhist statue, Yao Yuqin and Lv Shiqian continued to paint pine and bamboo. After Shiqian's pine was completed, Jin Shu wrote a poem on it. Jin Shu's poetry and prose are outstanding. His calligraphy is strong and graceful, combining the style of the Jin people and the backbone of the Northern Wei Dynasty, but killing his wilderness. He is addicted to drunkenness. His calligraphy and painting are even more rare. There were many examples of his calligraphy displayed that day. Entering the first room of the school, Zhang Changlao's ink paintings of flowers and running script were on a four-panel screen. This is what I have repeatedly seen in Dongmai's residence and wanted to lie down for. His use of brushstrokes and ink is purely the method of ancient calligraphers. His brushstrokes are unpredictable, and his ink is thick and heavy. A cabbage and a taro are like the weights and measures of the pre-Qin period. I once saw a large ink lotus by Bada Shanren collected by Yu Meizhen at the National Art Exhibition. Its strangeness and dignity, and its divine beauty are very similar to this. Mr. Weng can almost be said to be Bada Shanren. I also thought of the ink vegetables and radishes drawn by Zhang Manqing on the walls of the Chinese Literature and Art College. Its spirit is also thousands of years above. Painting is only this way, without seeing powder, with a few strokes, it is easiest to see a person's ability. On the Changming Building are all ancient masterpieces. I did not climb the building because I was in a hurry, but just from what I saw downstairs, it was like looking at the mountains in late spring, with all kinds of colors. You don't have to be on the Shanyin Road to be too busy to look around. A painting of osmanthus by Mr. Ge Zhiying, with light ocher stones behind the roots and several ink bamboo stalks in the sun. The thickness of the osmanthus and stones, and the beauty of the ink bamboo, are all revealed in a small space. What a sight to behold! His ink peach blossoms are all painted with the method of stone tablets, full of ancient flavor. Mr. Changlao does not have many disciples. Since the death of Shi Zeng and Yu Meicheng, the only one I know is Ge Zhiying, who keeps his teacher's law. I once had a poem saying, "Ge Zhiying is simple and vigorous, and talents inherit his deafness," friends all think that this is knowing words, but I have not seen Ge Zhiying's paintings today, probably on the building. Also, I was surprised to hear that Hu Ding of Wuxi has fine albums on display, but they were also on the building and I did not see them. I only saw the four screens made by Ma Wanli in the corridor. Tinglu paints with the heart of a lyricist, and his taste is different from others. Dongmai's seal script screen, Huben Zhonglang, makes people think of Changlao. The school plaque is a large stroke, simple and thick and worth appreciating. The words of the wheelmaker, the minister cannot understand, and the son of the minister cannot receive it from the minister, the matter of art is not something that can be said by mouth, but I doubt that Mr. Dongmai's transmission of his family law has a way for the teacher to teach his son. It can be used as a laughter.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Theater Review</h3>
<p>— Old Stubborn</p>
<p>On the evening of the fourth, I watched a performance at the Shanghai Theater and entered the garden. Li Huiqun was performing the "Execution of Dou E." The erhuang slow tempo and quick sanyan sections were sung with a round tone and beautiful flavor. It was a pity that the execution ground scene was not performed, presumably due to time constraints. Next was Gao Qingkui's "Li Ling Stele." The daoban was sung very enthusiastically. The huilong tune of "(Tears Flow Like Pearls)"'s Tan-style singing used one and a half measures for the "liu" character. The middle beat connects to the "(My Son, Alas)" melody using two and a half measures. The melody still lands on the middle beat. It not only has韵味, but also portrays the desert warfare and the eagerness of a parent for their child. One cannot help but feel the infinite sadness and desolation arising from within. It is vividly depicted. Although Qingkui did not follow the Tan style of singing, his understanding of the artistic conception has reached it, only "(Seventh Son Returns to Yanmen)" and below are sung in yuanban. It is ultimately not as pleasant to hear as the quick sanyan. Moreover, "(Afraid that my son's life will end)"</p>
<p>If the "ba" character is not sung in sanyan, it is difficult to bring out the wonderful melody. This is something that students of opera cannot afford to ignore. The fan erhuang "(Great Song Supports the Bao Character)" uses six and a half measures for the melody. It is sung in one breath. It is excellent in the movements of discarding the helmet and armor during "Bumping the Stele". The main attraction was Xu Biyun performing the new play "Previous Life of Yu Tang Chun". (According to the play, the ending is at the Lan Bridge meeting, which is not successful. The regret is in the water village. It seems that the play could be named "Lan Bridge Regret," which would be more appropriate.) Biyun plays Lan Ruiyun, the daughter of scholar Lan. The scholar is deceived by the matchmaker, who arranged for her to marry Zhou Wengui, who is missing ten things. It forms a bad marriage. Then, led by the Luo God, she joyfully meets with Wei Jingyuan in the Luo. The next day, upon waking up, Yingyuan specifically comes to visit Ruilian. The two encounter at the well. They pledge their love and agree to meet at Lan Bridge. When they go to the appointment, the two are divided. Unexpectedly, they are frightened by fierce wind, thunder, and rain and both drown themselves. It is bizarre and strange, purely mythological. The entire play's set includes thunder, lightning, wind, rain, dragon palace, water palace, mountains, bridges, etc. It is very similar to the newly popular drama that emphasizes mechanisms. The play contains several humorous insertions. Biyun sings several sections of xipi erhuang nanbangzi with a novel melody. Her singing voice is loud and her momentum is consistent. It has gradually returned to the image of three years ago. Therefore, the audience is very satisfied.</p>
<h3>Travels in Nanyang (2)</h3>
<p>— Ling Hua</p>
<p>At six in the morning on the eleventh, I arrived in Hong Kong. Mr. Zhang wanted to go to Hong Kong immediately. Yesterday, I sent a telegram to his son. So I went to Kowloon Customs to visit his son. His son had not arrived. I met Customs officer Nian Feilie Saw, an Englishman. He was young and affectionate. I gave him my English book "Female Government" as a gift. According to ship regulations, third-class passengers must have a passport to go to Po. Mr. Zhang did not have one, so he did not re-board. I felt disappointed for him.</p>
<p>We set sail at 4 pm. There was wind. Some say that according to doctors, those who get seasick should eat more. Eating too much can prevent vomiting. An empty stomach makes it easier to vomit. I don't know if this is true.</p>
<p>I took the time to read my handwritten Western notes. Sparta had only 10,000 people. Athens had 300,000 people. It was based on twelve villages to form the most civilized municipal government. Today, our overseas Chinese are in the millions everywhere, but they do not understand this culture of self-government. Athenian colonies had a very strange custom. Regardless of the size of the group, the relationship between A and B was independent and free. Greeks do not understand. The Greek Mind, a person from A can manage B. Why is B subordinate to A? Although they recognize the mother country, they only share the sacred fire of blood, and have connections in culture and customs, but there is no relationship of dominance in politics. This is the unparalleled spirit of independence of their municipalities. (Myers) General History, page 98. I told the overseas Chinese that in the future, they must pay attention to community autonomy as an essential element of survival. If I have time overseas, I will use this to guide and help my fellow overseas Chinese. Because I have always advocated village governance. A businessman said that he built a church in Burma. I said that churches can also be built, but it is even better to build autonomous communities. Social education is especially important for the survival of mutual assistance overseas. One must know this.</p>
<p>It's hot. The temperature is 71 degrees Fahrenheit. I have already turned on the electric fan. So I changed into a lined jacket. People of mixed yellow and white races are sitting at the same table, which makes me think of the brotherhood of all mankind. But after all, because of the difference in national boundaries and skin color, emotional separation is inevitable. Men and women are mixed together, and there is also piano music for entertainment. I think that if we want to achieve universal harmony, we must use my strategy of mixing bloodlines. We must first eliminate racial boundaries. Besides the harmony based on the two sexes, all other strategies will fail. This is my conclusion.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (145)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Celebrated Scholars Laughingly Play Hide-and-Seek; A Charming Woman Willfully Offers Protection</p>
<p>Everyone said, "That sounds fair enough, but who should draw the lots?" Yi Hu'an said, "I nominate someone: let Zhen Cuixia draw the lots." Everyone agreed that it was a good idea, so they asked the elderly Zhen to carry it out. Zhen Cuixia had no choice but to walk up to the plate and pick one from the many paper rolls. She said, "I don't know who's inside." She handed it to Shi Guanping, who said, "Take a look yourself. You're not illiterate." Zhen Cuixia then unfolded the paper roll and saw the two words "Yi Qing" written in a neat and upright manner. Zhen Cuixia held up the paper roll with the words on it towards the Yi Qing Fairy Hall and said, "Your name is written on this. It's your turn to be the first." Zheng Yanshou clapped his hands from the side and laughed, "Of course! I originally suggested that you be the first to do it. You said I was trying to put you up to it. Now that fate has decided, what else can you say? Because you spoke the best just now and are an expert at hide-and-seek, it's most appropriate for you to initiate it." Shi Guanping also laughed, "Old Fourth, it's destined for you. You do it!" As he laughed, he moved the plate aside. Zuo Shichen was thinking, "Everyone's intention is to have Yi Qing Fairy Hall do it the first time. Zheng Yanshou has already spoken for everyone's intention. But to force her to do it seems like oppressing her with the opinion of the majority. Drawing lots is a good idea, but unexpectedly, the drawn lot is exactly what everyone wants. It can be considered a harmony between heaven and man. It's appropriate for Yi Qing Old Fourth to do it. But because things are too coincidental, I have some doubts. I don't want Shi Guanping, Zheng Yanshou, and others to deliberately tease Yi Qing Old Fourth. I'm afraid all the lots in the plate are written with the two words 'Yi Qing'." Thinking this, he looked at Shi Guanping. He wished he could run over and unfold each of the paper rolls in the plate to see. Although he thought this way, he didn't go to look. Because he thought it would be very suitable and interesting for Yi Qing to start first. At that moment, Yun Lai happily said, "Old Fourth, come over here. I'll blindfold you." She took a square of Indian silk handkerchief with a rose-purple background and embroidered hydrangea flowers. The handkerchief was two feet square and was going to blindfold Yi Qing. Yi Qing said, "I'm a little suspicious. Why does everyone want me to go first?" Yun Lai said, "Don't worry about it. Just do it once. If you catch someone, you can get away. It's like a drowning ghost finding a replacement. Once you find a replacement, you can be reborn." As she laughed, she blindfolded her. Yan Yichen said, "Tie it tight. Don't let her see out. You two mustn't collude!" Originally, this game of hide-and-seek is called '捉盲盲 (zhuō máng máng)' by the locals, which literally means 'catching the blind.' The eyes are completely covered, just like a blind person.</p>

The consolidation of 6% was 2,285,000 yuan for the January period and 2,100,500 yuan for the April period. The 96 consolidation was 1,015,000 yuan for the January period and 1,020,000 yuan for the April period. The seven-year was 565,000 yuan for the three-month period and 365,000 yuan for the April period. Financial bonds were very scarce, with the April period never opening. The February period had transactions of only 100,000 yuan. Spot transactions were still rare, with 56,300 yuan traded for the entire week. Except for the consolidation of 6%, continued large, and Rehabilitation bonds, each with 15,000 yuan, the others were generally only several thousand yuan. As for the changes in the prices of the bonds, the situation within the past week, the situation had a turning point every day, and the bond market environment was optimistic. The financial market felt quite relaxed. General floating funds were mostly concentrated in public bond investments. The market buying was extremely prosperous. The prices of the bonds with the low circulation of spot goods increased sharply due to the great disparity between supply and demand. Financial 96 bonds jumped high by about 1.5 yuan. Others hovered at a few jiao on Tuesday. On Monday and Tuesday, they each increased by about 1 yuan. On Thursday and Friday, the Customs tax and Rehabilitation continued series increased by about 1 yuan, while other bonds each rose by about half a yuan. The increase was most fierce on Saturday. Customs tax jumped 3 yuan, and the rest, except for 96 bonds, each increased by 1 to 2 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous week, the Customs tax rose by about 8 yuan, and the others also rose by 3 to 4 yuan. The strength of the rise in bond prices was quite surprising. The high, low, rise, and fall of each bond price during the week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Spring Sales Season and Developing Customer Demand</p>
<p>The Color of the Situation is also Bright</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the yarn market was extremely sluggish, because the situation of American cotton three-grade yarn was bad, and the price decline was extremely strong. In addition, the situation was not good, and the inventory of yarn in various factories increased. As a result, people's hearts were weak, and the selling trend was even stronger. The demand for spot yarn from various gangs was not smooth. The sellers still tried to force down the price. Later, the situation suddenly became bright, and gangs in Tianjin, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guangdong began to explore purchases at the same time. The purchase volume was mostly 10-count coarse yarn, so the market became tight and rebounded. According to the statistics of various gangs at the end of the week, 13,825 bales were purchased. The peer group's digestion was quite healthy, with 8,000 bales. The market price for Japanese yarn was firm due to the shortage of goods. The price of local yarn was tired at first and then rose later. The price of exchange-traded yarn was tired at first due to the poor atmosphere and the softening of buyers. Later, those who made profits moved and cleared a large number of empty bales. The price rose even more sharply last week. This is because the situation is good, the season is still spring, and various gangs may have large-scale operations. However, American cotton has been declining throughout, with the prices for each month rising by 1 li 1 qian to 24 qian compared to the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 107,250 bales. The prices and bale volumes purchased by each gang are listed below:</p>
<p>Gang/Region Bales Gang/Region Bales Gang/Region Bales Sichuan 2,600 Tianjin 3,320 Miscellaneous Gangs 610 Guangdong 1,300 Niuzhuang 400 Peers 8,000 Inland 1,600 Zhenjiang 140 Xuzhou 355 Qinhuangdao 170 Anqing 250 Qingdao 450 Jiangxi 360 Hankou 200 Yunnan 1,080 Shantou 420 Xiamen 120</p>
<h3>Cotton Slightly Affected by Overseas Markets Last Week</h3>
<p>American Cotton Plunged by 120 Pounds... Han Standard Down Slightly by 3-4 Qian Each Factory Ordered More Than 50,000 Pieces of Indian Cotton... More Than 1,000 Pieces Arrived at the Wharf The overseas cotton market tends downward, and the situation is quite weak, with a great tendency to intensify, and new low prices are discovered step by step. The local cotton market was not greatly affected, because the inventory was relatively thin, and the sources from various routes were declining. The Han Gang absorbed a large amount and tightened the spot goods without releasing them. The market trend was firm. However, Indian cotton continued to decline, and the selling price was quite cheap. Each factory purchased orders very enthusiastically. The business of local cotton was therefore blocked. This situation is rare in recent times. The future of the cotton market is difficult to predict. The Han Standard initially fell with the foreign cotton. Later, the Han Gang absorbed more, and the market trend was firm. As a result, the price for each month fell by only 2-4 qian compared with the previous week. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 191,800 dan. American cotton fell by 120 pounds compared to the previous week. Each factory purchased 55,770 dan of future Indian cotton. Brokers entered 2,900 dan. 1,300 bales of Yao flowers and 70 bales of Tong flowers arrived at the wharf. The volume purchased by each factory and broker is listed below:</p>

<h3>Local Yarn Inventory Increased Again in February</h3>
<p>Hua Ying Factory Increased by 17,000... Japanese Factory Decreased by 2,800</p>
<p>At the end of February, the inventory of yarn in various yarn factories in the local area was 125,811 bales, an increase of 14,198 bales compared to the end of January. The inventory of Hua Ying Factory was 115,670 bales, an increase of 17,02 bales. The inventory of Japanese factories was 10,145 bales, a decrease of 2,805 bales. Looking back at the figures for the same period last year, the magnitude of the changes is not as great as the feeling of a changing sea. The inventory of each count is listed separately below, and compared.</p>

<h3>American Cotton Broke Through the 14-Cent Barrier</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was tired at first due to the lack of buyers and the selling by foreign merchants. It was firm later due to the hedging of some short positions. The futures fell by 7 to 12 pounds, the spot fell by 10 pounds, and the British cotton fell by 19 to 20 pounds, and the spot fell by 20 pounds. The Egyptian cotton spot was unchanged. The original telegram recording is on the left (8th telegram).</p>

<h3>Reduced British Cotton Consumption</h3>
<p>American Cotton Decreased by 270,000 Bales Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>The Violent Decline is the Main Reason</p>
<p>The recent decline in American cotton has been quite fierce, with a great tendency to go downhill. The main reason is the reduced consumption. According to the British telegram, the statistics of raw cotton usage in February decreased compared to the past two years. This is due to the stagnant cotton market situation. Among them, American cotton decreased by 200,700 bales compared to 1929. Indian cotton increased by 31,000 bales, and other types of cotton increased by 140,000 bales. It can be seen that the promotion of cotton planting by various countries is gradually taking effect. The reduced consumption of American cotton is not without a considerable relationship. The statistics of raw cotton used by various factories from August 1, 1929, to January 1930, are compared with the recent two years as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1930 1919 1928 Year to Year to Year to February February February American Cotton 944 1,151 1,178 Egyptian Cotton 22 221 192 Indian Cotton 138 107 69 Other 416 276 375 Total 1,709 1,755 1,814</p>
<h3>Overview of Japanese Raw Cotton Consumption</h3>
<p>American Cotton Increased, Chinese Cotton Gradually Decreased</p>
<p>The Japanese textile industry is gradually advancing, and the raw cotton consumption situation is also changing accordingly. Chinese cotton was originally in an important position. Now, the demand from Chinese cotton mills is large, and the price is no longer as low as before the European war. Furthermore, due to quality reasons, consumption has decreased compared to before. Indian cotton is still welcomed by Japan if the price difference slightly exceeds American cotton. However, Japanese factories regret the deterioration of the best quality of Indian cotton, especially the deterioration of the American cotton variety in Mingzhebu. Therefore, the use of American cotton by Japan has a tendency to increase. The currently commonly used 7/8 Tex Weave is gradually increasing. Spinning medium-count yarn and fine yarn will inevitably use more American cotton. Comparing the two five-year periods of 1911-1916 and 1917-1911, the consumption of American cotton increased by 78%, Indian cotton increased by 25%, and Egyptian cotton, which was not commonly used, also increased by 62%. As for Chinese cotton, which is only used for coarse yarn of 10 counts and below, it decreased by 4.4%. This situation has become even more obvious recently. The Japanese hardly pay attention to Chinese cotton.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cotton Yarn Production Slightly Decreased in February</h3>
<p>Rate of Work Reduction 11.2%</p>
<p>Production Reduction Rate is Only a Strong 5%</p>
<p>Two Points are Worth Noting</p>
<p>The Japan Spinners' Association announced that the production of Japanese cotton yarn in February was 234,103 bales, a decrease of 1,233 bales compared to the previous month. February 15 was the date for the implementation of work reduction in Japanese sand factories. The nominal rate of work reduction was 17%, but the actual rate was 11%. However, the production reduction was only a strong 5%. This is noteworthy. The production volume is recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Count January Production Compared to January Fine Yarn 80,965 Increased by 189 Coarse Yarn 65,297 Decreased by 4,105 Medium Count 9,20 Increased by 434 20 Count 78,733 Increased by 1,849 Total 234,103 Decreased by 1,232</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Turns Dull and Weak Again</h3>
<p>Accumulation and Military Resale Both Occur</p>
<p>Rumors of Mainland Ban on Exports Abound</p>
<p>Yesterday, many boats from various districts arrived at Zhabei, making it difficult to reduce river storage. Sales in this market street turned dull due to the clear weather. Furthermore, both buyers and sellers hesitated at the beginning of the morning session. Later, a few sellers followed the market trend, causing the price of mid-grade northern japonica rice to fall. Recently, the price of japonica rice has been fluctuating, with buyers from various regions either accumulating stock or reselling to the military. Therefore, there is no fixed price trend in the market. The overall situation throughout the day was dull and weak due to quiet buying sentiment. Sales of newly arrived paddy rice in the southern districts were also inconsistent. Only sporadic transactions occurred, with no significant price changes. A small amount of Yangdu indica rice arrived, selling at a flat price. The remaining river storage is still priced at a premium. Due to weak market sentiment, sellers do not seem to be in a hurry to sell, and prices remain at their original levels.</p>
<p>Arrivals from the Shanghai South River are still being sold in the market, with sales being acceptable. Early-season machine-milled rice from Changshu, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang initially had a very good appearance, and prices were slightly firm across the board. However, news of poor conditions from Zhabei then caused prices to level off again. Retail sales of Zou Zhuang rice are inconsistent, with varying degrees of liquidity. The price of early rice fluctuates by about ten cents, but the surface level remains stable. Yangdu pointed rice is generally well-regarded, but the presence of foreign competition limits large-volume transactions, and prices remain stable. Baiyuan rice is mediocre, with only a few smaller transactions taking place, and prices remain stable. Overall, the rice market cannot be taken lightly, as rumors of a mainland ban on exports are said to be coming into effect.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Coarse Brown Sugar and White Sugar Rise Sharply by More Than Five Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, sugar market production area telegrams arrived on a Sunday, which is normally without telegrams. The association market determined that buying sentiment for No. 24 coarse brown sugar from Dutch Indies sugar mills was gradually being released and prices rose from firm. The transaction price was 1.15 taels per share, a sharp increase of five cents from the previous day, and the number of households exiting was sparse. Market prices were then raised again, resulting in a standoff. In the end, there were still no transactions in the afternoon market, and the market situation was particularly stable. Ground fine coarse white sugar was priced at 7.20 taels and No. 20 medium fine white sugar was priced at 6.90 taels, with quieter transactions. There were not many Japanese sugar imports and exports and the market saw a slight increase. Z Mark was priced at 7.75 taels, YS Mark was priced at 7.70 taels, and TY Mark was priced at 7.60 taels.</p>
<h3>Coal Sales Surge with Clear Weather</h3>
<p>After continuous spring rains last week, coal sales in this port were slow. Out-of-town customers also did not make purchases. Transactions picked up yesterday afternoon when the weather cleared, and the market became lively. Total sales city-wide reached more than 3,700 tons, with bituminous lump coal accounting for the largest share at more than 1,530 tons, but the selling price was not stable. Bituminous coal tailings were second, at approximately 1,310 tons. Anthracite coal was the least, at 936 tons, but selling prices were slightly better than those of bituminous coal, as recent supplies of anthracite coal have been scarce and the market has limited inventory.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Continuing Weakness in Silk Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Extremely Low Overseas Silver Prices... Fluctuations in Exchange Rates with the United States Still Severe</p>
<p>Yokohama Raw Silk Plunges... India Levies Import Duty on Silk</p>
<p>Last week, the foreign silk market in this port was weak. Transactions involving factory white, yellow, and gray silk skeins amounted to less than 400 bales. The current release of raw silk is almost at a standstill. The reasons for this can be attributed to four factors: (1) Extremely low prices for sea salt, coupled with significant fluctuations in the gold market. The raw silk markets in London and New York were consistently sluggish. The exchange rate with the United States was unstable, and telegrams from silk factories in Lyon indicated continuing weakness in raw silk prices. (3) Yokohama raw silk prices plummeted, with the best-quality silk quoted at a sharp drop of 150-160 yen. (4) India began to implement import duties on silk, causing Chinese silk importers in British India to adopt a wait-and-see approach. The benefits of silk sales in Shanghai were reduced as a result. Furthermore, silk merchants were unwilling to sell at a loss, as raw silk inventories were low and silk prices remained high. Last week, the market price of various silk skeins was maintained, leading to a consistent weakness in the overseas Chinese silk market. The list of market prices for Chinese silk in the European and American markets at the end of last week is presented below (New York prices are in US dollars per pound; Lyon prices are in francs per kilogram):</p>
<p>Silk Type　New York　Lyon　Silk Type　New York　Lyon</p>
<p>High Grade Shanghai Skein　5.45　358　High Grade Dried Skein　3.44　32</p>
<p>Top Grade Shanghai Skein　3.15　303　Medium Grade Dried Skein　2.92　177</p>
<p>Medium Grade Shanghai Skein　4.50　247　Low Grade Dried Skein　2.32　141</p>
<p>Low Grade Shanghai Skein　3.68　200　High Grade Large Skein　3.00　181</p>
<p>High Grade Shandong Skein　4.52　249　Low Grade Large Skein　2.30　139</p>
<p>High Grade Sichuan Skein　4.57　251　High Grade White Silk　2.05　154</p>
<p>High Grade Gray Skein　2.10　143</p>

<h3>Danish Crown Prince Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Grand Welcome by Chinese and Danish Officials and Businessmen</p>
<p>Original Ship to Enter Beijing This Wednesday</p>
<p>His Mission is to Tour and Investigate Danish Businesses</p>
<p>Crown Prince Frederik of Denmark, son of King Christian X, and Prince Knud, along with a party of seven, embarked on the steamship Fionia of the Danish East Asiatic Company from Europe, traveling east on a sightseeing tour. En route, they encountered a hurricane, delaying their voyage. The Danish Crown Prince and his party arrived at the Haiguan Wharf at 3:50 PM yesterday, disembarking to the sounds of welcome music from Chinese and Danish officials, businessmen, and the military. The steamship Fionia was moored on the Bund outside the French Concession.</p>
<p>Photograph of the Danish Crown Prince Disembarking, taken by Wang Kai.</p>
<p>The welcoming scene: The Danish Crown Prince's ship, the Fionia, sailed into the Wusongkou at 1:00 PM yesterday. The Chinese national flag, with a white sun on a blue sky, flew high from the ship's foremast, while the Danish flag, with a white cross on a red background, flew from the mainmast. The ship, painted a light yellow color, passed the Wusongkou and was greeted by a 21-gun salute from the Chinese Hai Rong warship. The Danish Crown Prince and his party stood at attention on the ship's deck in return. At 2:30 PM, the ship sailed past the Xinguankou Wharf and moored at the French Navy pontoon. Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Wang Guangqi, Liu Naifan, Chen Shiguang, Liu Yunfang, and Tang Shixuan), the Shanghai Special Municipality (Yu Hongjun), the Songhu Garrison Command (Chen Zekuan), and the Danish Acting Consul-General in Shanghai (Dirksen), boarded the Customs patrol boats Jinghui and Lifly, which were prepared to receive the guests at the Xinguankou Wharf. The representatives ascended the Danish Crown Prince's steamship, where the Danish Minister to China, Hoffmann, received the Chinese representatives. Consul-General Dirksen then introduced the Crown Prince, his son, and daughter to each of the Chinese representatives, who shook hands and exchanged greetings, expressing their warm welcome. The two sides chatted briefly on deck before the Chinese representatives bid farewell and returned to the wharf on the Lifly patrol boat. About half an hour later, the Danish Crown Prince and his party disembarked from the Fionia and boarded the Jinghui patrol boat, which took them to the Xinguankou Wharf. At that time, the military band of the Songhu Garrison Command and the Shanghai Municipal Police successively played the Danish national anthem. Chinese and Danish officials and businessmen also removed their hats to pay their respects. At 3:50 PM, the Danish Crown Prince and his party disembarked to the sounds of welcoming music and drove to the Danish Church on Avenue Villemon, now known as Shaanxi South Road, in the French Concession to attend a service. As a precaution, the Shanghai Municipal Council closed the iron sheds around the Xinguankou Wharf when the Danish Crown Prince and his party arrived. Numerous Chinese and Western police officers were deployed in the wharf area to maintain order. The Water Police Bureau and the Customs water patrol also dispatched police to protect the area on the river. Due to the large crowds of onlookers, traffic on the Bund was briefly congested when the Danish Crown Prince and his party landed.</p>
<p>Chinese and Danish Receptions: This trip to China is the first for the Danish Crown Prince during his tour of the East. Chinese and Danish officials and businessmen have prepared banquets to welcome him. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting and other government officials are scheduled to host a public banquet in Nanjing. In Shanghai, more than 300 Danish residents invited more than 100 diplomatic figures from various countries in Shanghai to a public banquet at the Cercle Sportif Français last night. This afternoon, the Danish Crown Prince invited all Danish residents in Shanghai to a tea party on the Fionia. In the evening, Danish Consul-General Dirksen hosted a public banquet at the consulate on Rue Luber, now known as Sinan Road. At 10:00 PM, Madsen, Director-General of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, held a banquet and dance at the Grand Hotel. From the Chinese official side, Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Zhang Qun and Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui originally planned to host a public banquet. However, as the Danish Crown Prince indicated that the purpose of this trip was purely for sightseeing and to investigate the status of Danish commerce in the Far East, without any political mission, they expressed their gratitude and declined. Nevertheless, Mayor Zhang, as a local official, arranged to visit the Fionia at 12:30 PM this afternoon with Secretary-General Yu Hongjun. Director Chen and Section Chief Liu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office are also scheduled to visit at 9:00 AM this morning to discuss official business. During their stay in Shanghai, the Danish Crown Prince and his party will tour the city during the day and return to the ship to stay overnight. They are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the original ship on the morning of the 12th, tour Jinshan and Jiaoshan in Zhenjiang, and enter Beijing on the 13th. The Ministry of Navy has dispatched a patrol ship to escort them to Beijing. The Danish Crown Prince is scheduled to leave Beijing on the original ship on the evening of the 14th or the morning of the 15th for Japan.</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the Crown Prince: The Danish Crown Prince was born in 1899 and is currently 31 years old. He is not yet married, possesses intelligence and natural talents, and has studied with other students from his country, undergoing the same examinations. At the age of 18, he entered the naval academy, receiving the same treatment as other students, without any special privileges due to his status as Crown Prince. This reflects both the royal family's admiration for the virtue of equality and the Crown Prince's own desire for self-discipline. The Crown Prince enjoys the navy and entered the naval service after graduation, rising from junior lieutenant to captain. According to experts, given the Crown Prince's talent and learning, if he were not the Crown Prince, he would undoubtedly be one of the world's leading naval officers. The Crown Prince also holds an army commission, but this is not his preferred field and is merely a titular position. According to the Danish constitution, the Crown Prince can attend State Council meetings upon reaching the age of 18. Therefore, the Crown Prince regularly attends two cabinet meetings each month with his father, the King, but always follows constitutional norms and never interferes with the powers of the cabinet. He regularly meets with leaders of political parties to discuss domestic and foreign affairs and pays close attention to newspaper reports. Each year, when the King and Queen travel, they leave the Crown Prince to oversee the country, which is met with universal respect and affection from the people. The Crown Prince enjoys music and often travels to foreign countries, but this is his first visit to the Far East. Prince Knud, the King's second son, is 29 years old. Prince Axel, the King's cousin, previously visited China as a naval officer and is a director of the local East Asiatic Company. Prince Axel is married to a Swedish Countess, the sister of the Princess of Belgium and the Princess of Norway. Others in the Crown Prince's party include Palace Minister Ba, Military Attaché Navy Colonel Telle, Physician Gu Anmo, the Crown Prince's male servant, and the Princess's female servant.</p>
<h3>Concession Courts to Close on Sun Yat-sen Memorial Day</h3>
<p>The Provisional Court and the Court of Appeals will follow precedent to close for one day on March 12 (Wednesday), which is the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen’s death. President Xu has ordered all court personnel to comply and has notified the police stations to suspend the filing of criminal cases on that day in commemoration.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Leaves Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Safely Arrives in Fukuoka, Japan After 2:00 PM</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Shanghai, 9th - The Japanese passenger aircraft that arrived in Shanghai from Fukuoka, Japan, on the 7th completed its initial test flight in a very short period of time. Today (the 9th), at 7:58 AM, it flew back to Fukuoka. The weather in the morning was clear and sunny, with sunlight shining on its silver wings. After taking off, it circled in the sky once before turning its nose east. At 8:06 AM, the shadow of the aircraft gradually disappeared from view. The estimated arrival in Fukuoka is at 2:00 PM (1:00 PM Shanghai time), but some delay may be unavoidable due to slightly strong northerly winds over the China Sea.</p>
<p>Reuter's News Agency, Fukuoka, 9th - The Sino-Japanese international liaison aircraft, which flew back to Fukuoka today, experienced considerable difficulty when departing from Shanghai due to a headwind of 10 meters per second. It took 5 hours and 49 minutes and safely arrived at Fukuoka at 2:47 PM, landing on the water. All of the crew members were in excellent spirits. The second test flight has been scheduled for early morning the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Ministry Order to Suspend Collection of Domestic Goods Advertising Tax</h3>
<p>The municipal government has received a Ministry of Industry communication stating that the Shanghai National Products Factory Association has reported that Chinese industries are underdeveloped and depend entirely on domestic goods factories to increase production and promote sales to maintain commerce and benefit the people. Promotion of domestic goods depends on advertising, and advertising is most importantly done through issuing advertisements. Your ministry along with the Ministry of Interior have promulgated methods to encourage domestic products. Item 2 Subsection 2 of the methods of the Ministry of Interior specifies that local public safety bureaus should specially permit the posting of domestic product advertisements on local walls without charging any fees. The two ministries have already made this binding on the provincial and municipal governments, ordering them to comply. Currently the provinces and cities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have established bureaus to collect advertising taxes and have strictly set tax regulations. Tax levies vary from province to province and are excessively high. No distinction is made between domestic and non-domestic products. Your National Government has clearly ordered the encouragement of domestic products and all excessive and miscellaneous taxes should be eliminated. Since the levying of advertising fees is not permitted by the Ministry of Interior, please inform the provincial and municipal governments to order their subordinate financial authorities to investigate and close any existing advertising tax bureaus, ensuring that domestic product advertisements are exempt from all taxes and preventing the establishment of any new bureaus. The ministry has examined last year's West Lake Exposition's domestic product movement, in which merchants were detained by the Hangzhou Municipal Advertising Tax Bureau for distributing advertising pamphlets. Merchant groups in Shanghai, Nanjing, and other locations have filed complaints and sent representatives to Beijing to petition. Your ministry has requested the Zhejiang Provincial Government investigate and handle the matter. Subsequently, the Central Executive Committee Secretariat sent a letter from the National Treaty Abolition Promotion Association requesting that domestic product advertising taxes be waived and non-domestic product advertising taxes be increased to promote domestic products. The request was reviewed and submitted to the Ministries of Industry, Finance, and Interior by a Standing Committee member. The Ministry of Industry, Finance, and Interior jointly agreed to exempt all domestic product advertising taxes and sent a letter to the authorities for verification. Now, the National Products Factory Association has submitted the same situation. In addition to the instructions, a corresponding report is made to your special municipal government, requesting that the subordinate Finance Bureau be instructed to investigate domestic product advertisements. If there are bureaus that collect taxes, they must be ordered to stop collecting taxes within a specified period to promote domestic products and comply with the established resolution.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Long-Distance Telephone Plan</h3>
<p>The North Hui Section Can Be Equipped Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Construction Bureau is currently implementing a long-distance telephone plan within the county. After the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Automobile Company built a road for automobiles from Minhang to Shanghai Special Municipality, the company erected telephone poles and installed telephone sets to facilitate the communication of news at each station. A telephone office was established in Minhang and a switching center was established in Caohejing to connect with Shanghai South City. However, apart from the three locations of North Bridge, Minhang, and Zhuanqiao, which could communicate with Shanghai Special Municipality, other rural areas could not. Director Yu Wenhua of the bureau, recognizing this, formulated a county-wide long-distance telephone plan. The route will use a double-wire system to be consistent with other long-distance telephones. The plan will cover a total of over one hundred li, with each li costing two hundred yuan for labor and materials, totaling over twenty thousand yuan. The funding for the North Hui line has been secured and construction can begin soon. The remaining lines will be laid out successively upon receipt of instructions from the Bureau. The four lines planned are as follows: (1) North Hui Line: From North Bridge via Maqiao Town to Huiqiao, a total of thirteen li. After completion, this line can connect with the towns and villages of Songjiang County. (2) Northeast Line: From North Bridge via Tangwan Town, Chegou Town, crossing the Huangpu River, via Tangkou Town, Chenhang Town, Qiaotou Town, Tianhua Temple, West Sanlintang Town, to East Sanlintang Town, a total of thirty-seven li. This line will use double-core underwater cables when crossing the Huangpu River. (3) Hua Shi Line: From Huajing Town via Caohang Town, Zhuanqiao Town, North Bridge, Minhang, to Shi Zui Jiao, a total of thirty-two li. The line from Zhuanqiao to Minhang can be built along the Shanghai-Minhang automobile road. (4) Shanghai-Hua Line: From Huajing Town along the Shanghai-Minhang automobile road to Caohejing Town, the boundary of Shanghai Special Municipality, a total of fourteen li.</p>
<p>Regarding the distribution of telephone sets: (A) A small 20-line switchboard will be installed in North Bridge to facilitate city-wide communication between county government agencies and businesses, as well as to connect to long-distance calls to various towns and villages. (B) A three-line telephone set will be installed in each town and village office to facilitate switching of calls between the towns and villages.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoon Industry Holds Trade Association Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Improve Silk Packaging</p>
<p>Request Issuance of Public Bonds</p>
<p>The Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Silk Cocoon General Association and the Shanghai Silk Factory Association invited all silk factory operators in Shanghai to a spring banquet at the Yizhi Xiang Western Restaurant yesterday (the 9th). The participants discussed improving silk packaging and the current state of the silk market. Over 100 people attended, including Huang Jinchen, Shen Huachen, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Jingan, Huang Jinfan, Zhang Peishen, factory owners, and managers. After the attendees were halfway through their meals, the trade association meeting began. Huang Jinchen and Shen Huachen were elected as the chairmen. First, Wang Xiaolai provided a detailed description of the current state of the silk market and the business losses. Then, two key cases were discussed: (1) The proposal for the implementation of public measurement and inspection of exported raw silk. The chairmen Shen spoke one after the other indicating that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's implementation of public measurement and inspection of exported raw silk was in place in order to ensure fair valuation for both buyers and sellers. The law was good and beautiful but the ministry and bureau authorities sympathetic to the inability of silk merchants to make preparations, again extended the implementation date. The deadline of April 1 cannot be delayed further, and therefore appropriate and cooperative measures for improving the corners of the silk and silk packaging should be developed. Historically, silk packaging was done using oiled paper and white sheets, wrapped in loose burlap sacks and tied with ropes. This method is not only too wasteful, but also unable to show solemnity. Previously, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Factory Association proposed that the silk packaging be changed to new-style canvas bags, and all burlap sacks, ropes, oiled paper, etc. could be eliminated. Furthermore, to prevent theft along the way, German steel pliers would be used to crimp lead seals for security. This is because when factory silk is transported to the inspection office in the future, the silk packaging must be intact and the lead seal must be unbroken for it to be accepted. Therefore, this improvement of silk packaging is essential. Furthermore, the deadline is not far off, so all of our colleagues should make preparations as soon as possible to avoid being caught unprepared. A letter should also be sent to the Export Silk Association to schedule a joint meeting with Chinese and foreign silk merchants to discuss methods for improving the silk unbundling process. The proposal was passed. (2) The proposal to appeal to the government to take measures to assist the silk industry. The chairman explained that the foreign silk market was suffering from rampant gold prices, extremely low silver prices, and sluggish sales in Europe, causing all colleagues to suffer various losses and threatening their businesses. The situation was on the verge of bankruptcy. Everyone agreed that Yokohama raw silk prices had plummeted and that Japanese silk merchants, unable to sustain their businesses, had been assisted by the Japanese government with a large sum of money to guarantee their current failing trade to the rest of the world. The government has spared no effort to protect the industry. Now, at this critical moment, funds should be allocated to assist the industry. However, since the treasury is empty, other methods should be sought to maintain the silk industry. It was resolved that the two executive committees would jointly petition the government to issue silk industry public bonds and reduce silk cocoon taxes to maintain the industry. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Garrison Department to the City Representative Assembly</h3>
<p>Respected Sirs, Having recently read in the newspaper the resolution of your assembly's report on garrison work, we are grateful for your guidance on the garrison work of our department. However, regarding the fourth clause on handling criminals and the seventh clause on building barracks in the original resolution, our department will separately state the circumstances of our department's handling, as they may not be fully known to your assembly, hoping for your understanding. (1) Regarding the fourth clause of the original resolution, handling criminals, our department has always handled reactionary cases in accordance with the Law on Punishing Counter-Revolutionaries. Those who are considered guilty under the law have never been released due to the intercession of anyone, and those who are considered innocent under the law have never been prosecuted at the request of anyone. The past facts are known to the society and are also what our department is confident in. Therefore, those with insufficient evidence or insufficient suspicion cannot be forced into crime or ordered to be released on bail for investigation, or even acquitted of innocence, which is precisely to protect human rights and exercise caution. As for the statement that those who are released on bail are more powerful and allowed to roam freely, it is quite bizarre, and it is not known what it refers to. In some cases in our department, the suspicion is minor, and personnel from various Party and government departments are responsible for guaranteeing that someone is definitely not a Communist Party member or has no reactionary behavior. Our department trusts the personality and status of those responsible, or even allows them to be released on bail. This is not favoritism or indulgence, but because someone is responsible, it does not go beyond the scope of the law, so it is not indulgence. (2) Regarding the seventh clause of the original resolution, the construction of barracks, the Barracks Design Committee of our department is organized separately and was not handed over by former Commander Qian Dajun. The establishment process and planning situation were reported at the previous Representative Assembly. Due to the shortage of the national treasury, it has not been realized to this day. As for the fundraising and progress during the tenure of former Commander Qian, all files were not allowed to be handed over when he left office and could not be investigated. Combined statement, Acting Commander Xiong Shihui</p>
<h3>The Xiangchang Factory Dispute Will Soon Be Resolved</h3>
<p>The Factory Has Already Distributed Relief Money of Three Yuan Per Person</p>
<p>Negotiations on Severance Pay and Compensation Will Continue Today</p>
<p>Serious Negotiations with the Police on the Police Shooting Incident</p>
<p>The National News Agency stated that the cause, course, and the three-item solution decided by the 12th Committee meeting of the Citizens' Training Committee regarding the Xiangchang Cloth Factory dispute have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Citizens' Training Committee, in order to quickly and thoroughly resolve the issue, has been actively proceeding with the resolution in separate stages. The issue of relief money was resolved yesterday, and the rest can also be resolved within a short period of time. The details are as follows: (1) The issue of relief money and severance pay was handled by the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the committee through consultation and implementation plans. The preparatory committee appointed committee member Jin Yongchang and staff member Qin Boyan to negotiate with the factory. As a result, the factory temporarily distributed relief money of three yuan per person, totaling 8,720,000, which was collected and distributed by the workers' side. Regarding the issue of severance pay, both labor and management have concrete expressions of opinion, and the difference is not far. It is heard that negotiations will continue today. (2) The issue of compensation and injury expenses is handled by the Citizens' Training Committee, which also dispatched staff member Wu Jiaze to cooperate with the Social Bureau. Negotiations were also conducted yesterday, but there is still no clear lead. It is heard that negotiations will also continue today. (3) As for the police shooting and accidentally injuring people, the Municipal Party Department believes that a serious negotiation has been presented by the Municipal Government to the police department.</p>
<h3>The Seamen's General Union Requests the Restoration of the Hong Kong Branch</h3>
<p>The Seamen's General Union wrote a letter to the International Labor Office, stating that it had previously received a letter from your director regarding the restoration of the Hong Kong branch of our association. The Governor of Hong Kong still stated that our association has political implications and that the Hong Kong side has two trade unions representing the interests of seamen, please check. Therefore, the points that the Governor of Hong Kong said were inappropriate were summarized, and a letter was sent to your director refuting the Governor of Hong Kong and separately instructing the preparatory office of the branch in Shanghai to inform all on file. Now, according to the report of the preparatory office, the case was based on your association's instruction No. 2196, which is omitted here to avoid redundancy. Afterwards, it was learned that the office was to take short photos. According to the Governor of Hong Kong, although our association has no communist members, it still has political implications. This is inherently contradictory and inconsistent with the facts. If there are no communist members, how can there be political implications? Moreover, when this association was first established in Hong Kong, its sole purpose was to increase wages and strike, purely to improve the treatment of seamen by asking the capital to improve the lives of seamen. This is the only purpose of the International Trade Union and the symbol of this association's special efforts to seek benefits for the seamen themselves, without involving other effects. Even the strike to support the May 30th tragedy was to protect the lives of the people of the whole country. If this were to happen in this place in the British trade union, it would certainly have this behavior, which naturally cannot be pointed out as having political implications. To take another step, this association is now under the leadership of the National Government of our country. All the needs and demands of seamen are in line with the Party's policies that are beneficial to the people's livelihood. If this is said to contain political implications, then all the actions of the people's republic must be contrary to the Party's policies that are beneficial to the people's livelihood or under the oppression of long-term bad systems. May I ask if the United Kingdom has this people's organization, and its actions are said to have no political implications? Moreover, the Governor of Hong Kong stated that the interests of Hong Kong seamen are represented by other two seamen's unions. This is even more unreasonable. The two so-called seamen's unions almost refer to the China Shipping and Inland Shipping Trade Unions. These two trade unions follow the contracting system hundreds of years ago, deducting a large amount of wages and severely oppressing seamen. To discuss the issue of people and the association separately, the people who wield power in the two trade unions, Liang Yuanhe and Liang Kaizhou, are all contractors who practice the contracting system. The people who wield power in this association are mostly appointed by the central government or elected by members. Even if they are not perfect, they do not allow the scum of contractors to be mixed in. Furthermore, the system of this association aims to seek the interests of seamen. If there is a violation, there is supervision by the central government above and criticism by the seamen below. Even if they are extremely cunning, there is nothing to do. To summarize, one is that the people and the system are based on contracting, and the other is that the people and the system are based on benefiting workers. In other words, those two trade unions cannot represent the interests of seamen. This association can really represent the interests of seamen. (Omission) Also, the former Governor of Hong Kong, Jin Wente, has already been transferred. The new governor will not repeat the same mistakes and change the policy. It is also an opportunity for this association to demand the liberation of seamen and the restoration of the trade union. I dare to ask your association to strive for reasons as soon as possible. If the Hong Kong side listens, the trade union will be restored as soon as possible. If they do not listen, the central government will be asked to seriously protest against the United Kingdom. If they still do not listen, then it should be submitted to the country. All the seamen in Hong Kong who are harmed and misled into the communist path will be responsible by the Hong Kong government. The restoration of the trade union should be achieved so that the seamen can achieve freedom and equality, and avoid being ridiculed by foreigners. The former reason is that the Governor of Hong Kong replied to Domasi about the facts of this book and the boatmen and inland boatmen, and the reasons why it is inappropriate. I also respectfully submit to your association the methods for negotiating the restoration of the trade union. I earnestly ask for inspection and transfer to negotiate the restoration of the trade union members Yuan Shaochun. It is also sent to Domasi and the Governor of Hong Kong to check and handle, so as to be expedient and achieve it, which is convenient for the public. Therefore, I once again write to your director, earnestly asking for inspection and then writing to the Governor of Hong Kong, and do not obstruct the case in order to avoid disputes and strengthen friendship. It is really a public friendship. To the Director of the International Labor Office, Domasi, Director of the Organizing Committee of the China Seamen's Industrial Federation, Zhao Zhizhi, Committee Members Lin Yinsheng, Liang Degong, Huang Yushu, Miao Shuizhang, March 9th, 19th Year of the Republic of China</p>
<h3>The Pacific Association Regularly Invites the Canadian Ambassador to Japan to Give a Speech</h3>

It was resolved to convene a meeting of representatives and alternate representatives to discuss and finalize the agenda for attendance (date) Sunday at 10:00 AM. The meeting was adjourned after the agenda was discussed.</p>
<h3>The Presentation of the Pharmaceutical Workers' Union</h3>
<p>Regarding the Pharmaceutical Guild's Refusal to Accept Placement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Pharmaceutical Workers' Union submitted a document to the Citizens' Training Committee, stating: We hereby submit this presentation for the following matter: According to newspaper reports, the emergency meeting of the Pharmaceutical Industry Guild passed a resolution that firmly refused to accept the placement, with the Italian Public Security Bureau and police using force to suppress it and falsely accusing it of illegal actions. It is hereby investigated that the method of carrying out the placement of the unemployed in this industry was approved by your committee. How can the guild forcefully slander it and call it illegal coercion? Moreover, your committee has already ordered the guild yesterday to handle the placement within three days. The clear order is ignored, and the laws and regulations are even more regarded as trifles. Your committee should be asked to, on the one hand, stop the Public Security Bureau, etc., from approving the guild's request, and on the other hand, order the guild not to arbitrarily obstruct the placement and violate Party discipline and be condemned. Presented to the People's Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee, Shanghai Special Municipality Pharmaceutical Workers' Union respectfully presented on March 9, 19.</p>

<h3>The Miserable Situation of the Shaanxi Disaster Obtained by the Jisheng Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association received a report from the Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association in Ping that the disaster in Shaanxi Province has become increasingly tragic recently. The famine victims in the province are gathered, and they are thin and weak, supporting the old and the young. They grab food on the streets. In front of the relief meeting hall, the disaster victims gather and cry for help, which is unbearable to hear. Each county is now closing its doors during the day. Even close friends and relatives dare not accept them. Young women only ask for a full meal and then go with others. There is no smoke in 19 villages and towns. There are starved people on the road. As soon as they fall to the ground, they are cut and eaten. At the moment, there are three feet of accumulated snow on the roads in Guanzhong, and the remaining cold is piercing. The average number of people who freeze to death every day in each county is no less than three or four hundred. Hearing this, the association could not help but feel sad, but had to cry out to your association to be extra kind and save this dying orphan. The association was deeply saddened by this situation and had to do its best to raise funds.</p>

<h3>Songjiang Transportation Deputy Su Xianyang Accused</h3>
<p>Plaintiff: Shang Haishan, subordinate of Su</p>
<p>Accusing him of unauthorized arrest and public defamation</p>
<p>Second Complaint Filed with the Court</p>
<p>Su Xianyang did not appear in court at the hearing</p>
<p>Songjiang Transportation Deputy Su Xianyang was recently accused by Shang Haishan, the chief of police of the Songhu Salt Affairs Water and Land General Bureau, a subordinate under his command, of unauthorized arrest and public defamation. According to Shang's complaint, the incident occurred on January 21st of this year at 8:00 a.m., when Su sent a car to invite Shang, saying that there was an important matter to discuss. Shang took the car to Su's house, where Su made all sorts of false accusations without allowing Shang to defend himself. He then ordered his subordinates to keep Shang under surveillance and forced him into the car, which drove to the Suwu Prefecture Anti-Smuggling Bureau on Lin Yin Road. Upon arriving at the bureau, he ordered the bureau staff to tie up Shang. Shang was under his power at the time and had no choice but to endure the humiliation. At around 10:00 a.m., Vice Officer Cai of the bureau came to the room where Shang was imprisoned and said to Shang, "I am now acting on Deputy Commissioner Su's order to conduct a full body search immediately." Seeing that there were no prohibited items, he stopped. On that day, Shang repeatedly requested to be transferred to the court for processing, but the bureau ultimately did not dare to act without Su's orders, resulting in his imprisonment for four days and three nights. It was not until 4:00 p.m. on the 24th that he was released. Shang later learned that the reason for his release was the result of negotiations by his family. After Su arrested Shang, he went to the police station where Shang worked and announced Shang's various crimes, and appointed another person to take over as chief of police. Shang's family then hired a lawyer to send a letter questioning him, and Su replied with sophistry, claiming that unauthorized arrest was his inherent right. This was the height of Su's deliberate contempt for the law and trampling of human rights. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to send another letter based on the law, demanding that Shang be restored to freedom within 24 hours. Su initially demanded a guarantee, but then released Shang. Shang believes that investigation, arrest, search, and imprisonment are all the exclusive duties of the court. Su's actions constitute a violation of Article 316 of the Criminal Law, and Su also spread false information to damage his reputation, which also violates Articles 325 and 328 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, he requests the court to summon Su to court, punish him according to law, and order him to compensate for the appropriate losses. According to the complaint, the court believes that the defendant's actions are the function of administrative supervision, so it ruled that it would not accept the case. Shang Haishan was unwilling to accept the rejection of his complaint and asked his lawyer to draft a second complaint to the court. The complaint stated that the previous complaint had been rejected by the court, and that he was extremely frightened after reading it. The defendant did not act on any report or investigation before detaining the complainant, but purely on personal matters and suspicion. When the complainant asked the lawyer to send a letter to question him, the defendant cleverly decorated the text, but his attitude towards the complainant suddenly softened. On the 27th of last month, Yu Pu of the Salt Transportation Deputy Envoy's Office sent an appointment order appointing the complainant as the secretary general of the office, with a monthly salary of 200 yuan, and used words such as "deep roots and intricate knots, but become a sharp weapon" to comfort him. The complainant has suffered unbearable insults and unjust imprisonment, which has caused great physical and mental pain, and will also have a negative impact on his future career. Therefore, he has no choice but to resort to the law. If the complainant has any illegal activities, which can be used as a basis for investigation and accusation, then the defendant should have treated him according to the law from beginning to end. Why did he give him such sweet words afterward and put the previous matters aside? It seems that he suddenly put him on his knees and then threw him into the abyss, which clearly shows that the complainant is indeed innocent. Even if the defendant has the power of emergency disposal according to the function of administrative supervision, the responsibility for his abuse of power is still undeniable. According to Article 133 of the Criminal Law, a public official who pursues a crime and knows that the person is innocent but makes him subject to prosecution and punishment shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than seven years. (Omission) The complainant's previous complaint stated that his freedom was obstructed. The circumstances were not described in detail, resulting in the rejection of the complaint. Now, the complainant repeats the defendant's criminal facts. Although the defendant is a salt affairs official, he should obey the national law as an ordinary citizen. The National Government issued a solemn instruction on April 20th of last year, stating that within the jurisdiction of the Republic of China, no individual or group may infringe on the personal freedom of others through illegal acts. Violators will be severely punished according to law. Recently, the Legislative Yuan has also proposed a special chapter on protecting human rights. This is all because our administrative officials have always been free to act arbitrarily and despise human rights. Therefore, the laws and regulations are especially strict in order to prevent them. When the defendant committed the crime, he still knew to use both kindness and force. After the court rejected the complainant's complaint, his attitude changed and his arrogance became even worse. He ridiculed, scolded, and threatened, not only regarding the complainant as meat on a chopping board, but also treating the laws and regulations as trivial matters. The complainant would not have lightly initiated litigation if he had not been forced to do so. I humbly ask the court to be an independent judicial organ and not grant leniency to the above-mentioned abuses of power simply because the defendant has a special status. The court approved the issuance of a subpoena ordering the defendant, Su Xianyang, to appear in court for trial. Su then drafted an official letter to the court, the content of which contained several points similar to a defense, but the format was by no means a pleading. Presiding Judge Sun Yuanjun held a hearing once a few days ago, but the defendant did not appear in court as scheduled, and no lawyer appeared on his behalf. Only the complainant, Shang Haishan, stated the circumstances of the case, the words being the same as the two complaints. Judge Sun said that the original complaint had not been stated in detail and ordered him to supplement the detailed complaint, and summon the defendant to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Sixteen-Year-Old Boy Rapes Two Young Girls</h3>
<p>Using a few walnuts as bait</p>
<p>The two girls are only eight or nine years old</p>
<p>After the incident, he threatened them to keep silent</p>
<p>It's worrying for the world and people's hearts</p>
<p>Chen Hanliang, 16 years old, from Yangzhou, lives at No. 4 Dingjiazhai, west end of Chezhan Road behind the South Railway Station. He works as a waiter at the Juxianju Tea House at No. 433 Chezhan Road. His father, Chen Laoda, works as a blacksmith in the Longtoujian area of the South Railway Station. His son, Hanliang, although not yet an adult, is already sexually aware. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, he used a few walnuts to lure Genlin, the nine-year-old daughter of Zhu Liansheng, a carpenter who lives next door, to a nearby thatched hut (note that the thatched hut is inhabited by poor people from Jiangbei who leave early and return late), where he raped Genlin, causing injury to her lower body. He also threatened her not to make a sound. On the 8th, Genlin's mother, Pan, noticed a bloodstain on her crotch and interrogated her strictly. Genlin then told her everything that happened when she was raped by Hanliang that day, and said that Aibao, the eight-year-old daughter of Zhang Amao, a weaver at No. 1 next door, was also raped by Hanliang in the same place at 3:00 p.m. on the 2nd. Therefore, at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, Zhu Liansheng and Zhang Amao reported the incident to the Second District Police Station on Chezhan Road. Patrolman Ma took the two plaintiffs to the Second District Headquarters, where District Chief Wang sent detective Chen Chunsheng to the Juxianju Tea House on Lian Zhan Road at 4:00 p.m. to arrest Chen Hanliang and take him to the Second District Headquarters for interrogation, pending delivery to the local court.</p>
<h3>Shanghai River Telephone Trunk Cable Damaged</h3>
<p>Currently being repaired day and night</p>

The company is currently sending people to repair it day and night. It is said that it will be repaired and restored to normal soon.</p>
<h3>Plan to Rectify Yu Silk</h3>
<p>Establish a North-South Joint Association</p>
<p>The silk industry in this city has always relied on foreign firms for sales, which are the most significant. In recent years, the decline in exports of Yu silk has been attributed to the establishment of factories in the United States and imitation in neighboring countries. However, the main reason is the lack of credibility of the silk households in Henan Province, who are specialized in taking shortcuts. Defects such as short code, narrow surface, light weight, loose and sparse grades are often found. To restore credibility, a thorough rectification is required. Therefore, the industry leader Pang Zhuqing went to Henan Province to contact officials and businessmen, strictly prohibiting the silk households from cheating, and establishing a silk inspection institute. Any substandard goods are immediately inspected. After the rectification, the products from places such as Xuzhou have indeed improved compared to before. However, the origins of Yu silk are in almost half of the province, so it is still impossible to achieve uniformity. For example, the 2.6-foot wide (50-yard long) wide silk should be made of high-quality fine silk and high-level weaving workers, but some people use ordinary silk and ordinary workers. Therefore, it is now planned to establish a Northern Joint Association for Rectifying Yu Silk, and set up offices in both the production and sales areas. The northern part is responsible for reform and rectification, and the southern part is responsible for promotion and investigation of sales conditions in various countries, in order to make up for the shortcomings.</p>
<h3>Appeal for the Detained Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Fishing boat owner Zhang Dongsun was detained by He Detachment Leader of the Fifth District of Jiangyin Water Police for carrying glutinous rice for He Qikui. The Jiangyin County Government has already fined and released the glutinous rice, but the boat has not been released. The Ningbo Lugang Fishing Boat Association submitted a letter to the Civil Affairs Office, stating: "Miao Junjian, Director of the Civil Affairs Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the He Shikui rice case in Jiangyin was reported on January 19th. The county government has already received an order from your government to release the goods after imposing a fine for the nonconformity of the goods and taxes." He Detachment Leader and others should have complied with the order. The association members, including Zhang Dongsun, who is carrying rice and stone boat owners, claim that their boats are still detained. He Detachment Leader does not appreciate the kindness of the director, and the benefits have not been realized. It is truly regrettable. The boat owners have several mouths to feed, but the detachment leader has not considered this. The association believes that before the case is resolved, the detained persons should be detained for interrogation. However, now that the case is over, they should be released immediately so that they can make a living. There is no reason to make things difficult for them again, which is very suspicious. The association is pleading on behalf of the boat owners, requesting that they be released immediately, without delay, in order to benefit the shipping merchants. The association of Ningbo Lugang Fishing Boats kowtows."</p>
<h3>Two Girls Found on a Ship</h3>
<p>The suspect of abduction was released on bail</p>
<p>Wang Yulong and other officers of the Pudong Bailianjing Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Brigade were patrolling the river to the Nanmatou Pumiantou around 5:00 p.m. yesterday when they saw the Shengli steamboat about to set sail for Fujian. They immediately boarded the ship for inspection and inspected the cabins. There were two men and one woman carrying two young girls. When the men saw the police, they immediately became flustered, which was very suspicious. They were interrogated about their origins, but they stammered and evaded the question, fearing that there was something else going on. They were all taken back to the brigade, where Captain Xu interrogated them. One of them, Chen Zifang, from Fujian, 21 years old, said that he was a partner in the Nanhua goods store established by Weng Boying at No. 10 Dunhouli, Zhonghua Road, Nanshi. Today, he invited his companions to take the two young girls back to their hometowns. One of the girls, Li Guiying, is nine years old, from Hangzhou, and the other, Jiang Ailing, is ten years old, from Shanghai. When the captain asked about the origins of the two girls, Chen's words were quite ambiguous, only saying that Li Guiying was the adopted daughter of his wife and Jiang Ailing was the daughter of his family's maid. Another man, Ke Jinglan, 39 years old, from Fujian, and the woman, Chen Su, 48 years old, both said that they were acquaintances of Chen Zifang from the same village and were accompanying him back to their hometown. They both claimed not to know anything about the origins of the two girls. The captain believed that the origins of the two girls were unknown and that Chen was suspected of abduction. He ordered Chen and the others to be released on bail, and notified the families of the two girls to come and prove their identities before verifying the case.</p>

<h3>Flour Boat Carelessly Lost in the River</h3>
<p>Boat owner Geng Maomao hired Renji Company to load 200 bags of flour and 160 cans of kerosene the other day to be delivered to Sian. In the morning, he was moored on the southern bank of Zhoujiadu waiting for the tide to rise and set sail. At about 6:00 p.m., just as he was about to set sail, thick smoke suddenly rose from the cabin. Geng opened the cabin board and saw that more than a dozen cans of kerosene were burning. The neighboring boats did not dare to approach for rescue. Geng threw the burning oil from the cabin into the river and pressed down the fire with a cotton quilt. At that time, the villagers on the shore saw the fire and rushed to help put it out. Fortunately, the sky was not yet dark, otherwise the entire boat would have been difficult to save. Geng and one of his partners were burned. The bow of the boat was also scorched. Geng and his partner were sent to the hospital for treatment. Although the flour was not burned, it was all wet. Renji Company was notified and went to the boat to inspect the damage. The wet flour was unloaded and sold. Only 80 cans of kerosene were left in the boat. The rest were thrown into the river when they were burned and are being salvaged.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Dismisses Police Officers for Disobeying Orders</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Jiashan Section Police Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's South Station previously assigned 18 police officers to the shift, but due to problems with working hours, Police Chief Kong of the two lines transferred the police officers to the North Station and assigned 18 security team members to the South Station. It is now known that Kong Fanjun, the police chief of the two lines, issued a notice yesterday to the police chief of the Shanghai-Jiashan Section, stating that police officers Yang Jihua, Yang Wenjin, Qian Zhifeng, Wu Weizhi, Niu Xingan, Cao Xichen, Zhang Zhanming, Zhang Yuqiu, Li Xiangqing, Dong Jinkun, Lu Yonghui, Sheng Bonian, Wang Ruixiang, Xu Hanjiang, Tang Fengchi, Chen Bichang, Shi Wenming, Gao Wenchong, and 18 others are incorrigibly wicked, disobey orders, falsely accuse superiors, and coerce the public. They should be dismissed and sent to the Learning Center to improve themselves and uphold the law. Patrol Leaders Lu Zhenjia, Liu Yande, and Li Demao did not notice anything beforehand and neglected their duties. They should each be given a major demerit as a light punishment. The Management Bureau's Directive No. 94 has been presented and approved, stating that the proposed punishment methods are appropriate and should be followed. Therefore, in addition to sending the dismissed police officers to the Learning Center, the police chief should comply with the order and promptly submit a request for instructions for verification and transfer.</p>

<h3>Rape or Theft?</h3>
<p>Young Woman Shouts for Robber, Blows Whistle</p>
<p>Both Arrested and Taken to the Official's Office</p>
<p>In the middle of Xinmin Road, Zhabei, a young woman suddenly blew a whistle and shouted for a thief. For a while, pedestrians were alarmed and stopped to watch. Song Guangke, the tenth guard post police officer there, went straight to the sound and saw a man running away in front. He immediately caught up and arrested him, and planned to take the woman who blew the whistle to the station for questioning. However, the woman grabbed the police officer's uniform and refused to go. However, the guard believed that she had falsely reported the theft and violated the police law, so he finally arrested them and took them to the Fourth District Headquarters. Chief Jin questioned the woman, Pan Deng, 23 years old, from Danyang, who said that she was the owner of the Pan Fuxing Congee Shop on Xinmin Road. Her partner, Dai Xigen (i.e., the other defendant), had flirted with her from time to time, but she had always refused him. Last night, her husband was invited out by a friend, and during the quiet night, he sneaked into her room, jumped on the bed, and tried to rape her. She was extremely frightened and shouted, so he grabbed thirty yuan from her pillow and ran out. Now she is asking him for it, but he ran away. She was afraid that her husband would blame her when he returned, so she blew the whistle and chased him. When asked, Dai, 46 years old, said that he was a partner in Ms. Deng's shop. She wanted me to return five yuan of my wages, but I did not, so she falsely accused me of flirting and searched my pockets, so I ran out mad. Chief Jin investigated the case and believed that it was related to rape and theft, and each held their own opinion. They should be sent to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>

They argued back and forth until 7:00 p.m. without a resolution.</p>
<h3>Tobacco Paper Store Partner Embezzles Money and Returns Home</h3>
<p>Brought Back to Shanghai from Chongming</p>
<p>Repay the Money and Imprisoned for Three Months</p>
<p>Wu Zhiqing from Chongming embezzled a total of 760 yuan of banknotes and banknotes that Ma Zhongwen, the owner of the Youheng Tobacco Paper Store at No. 430 Dongyouheng Road, entrusted him to send to the shop's partner stores on October 18th of last year. He fled back to his hometown. After the incident, Ma went to Chongming to report it, and the local government arrested Wu. A detective from the Harbin Police Station was sent to bring him back and send him to the Provisional Court for prosecution. Ma hired lawyer Fan Gang to request a strict punishment and to recover the stolen money. Wu claimed that he only had 360 yuan, which was stolen on the streetcar. Judge Ge believed that the defendant's供述 were obviously excuses. Wu was sentenced to three months of imprisonment and ordered to compensate the plaintiff for 760 yuan.</p>
<h3>Trial Reconciliation of Debt Case</h3>
<p>Mr. Nuo, representative of the Yin Company, and lawyer Yan, visited defendant Qi Xi, a Russian, in court regarding a lawsuit. In November, the defendant allegedly borrowed 700 yuan from the plaintiff with a promissory note, stating that his own car would be used as collateral. However, the plaintiff later discovered that the car belonged to a certain car company, and the defendant had not paid off the car price. Therefore, the ownership of the car still belonged to the car dealership. The plaintiff argued that the defendant was clearly guilty of fraud and should be investigated by the court, and the borrowed money should be recovered. The defendant, also represented by a lawyer, argued that a guarantor was present when the loan was made. Even if the car did not belong to the defendant, the guarantor should be responsible for repayment, and the plaintiff should not be overly concerned. The defendant claimed that this case was entirely civil in nature, and the plaintiff should not file a criminal lawsuit. Judge Zhu instructed both parties to attempt reconciliation.</p>

<p>Family of the Deceased Requests Compensation</p>
<p>Car Owner Declares No Responsibility</p>
<p>Jin Genxiang, the assistant driver of car No. 759 on Medhurst Road in the Public Concession, belonging to Wu Laifu, drove the car out without permission on the 11th of last month. At the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, due to inexperience as a driver, he hit rickshaw puller Jia Fayou, causing fatal head injuries. The police arrested Jin and brought him to the French Concession Court. He was sentenced to imprisonment, and the plaintiff was granted the right to file a private lawsuit. Recently, another summons was received. The family of the deceased, represented by Yang Daibiao and lawyer Lai Mei, stated that the circumstances of the accident had already been explained previously and did not need further elaboration. The deceased's family included an elderly mother and wife, who relied on him pulling the rickshaw for a living. Now, tragically killed in the accident, the family's livelihood has been cut off. The family requested the court to order the car owner to jointly bear responsibility for the loss, including 200 to 300 yuan for the injured party. The defendant, car owner Wu Laifu, represented by lawyer Fei Xizhen, argued that the defendant Jin Genxiang was indeed the</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>assistant driver of his car. He did not notify or inform the regular driver or the car owner before driving out. The car was driven out privately, leading to the accident. Jin Genxiang should, of course, bear the responsibility, but the car owner had no involvement. He gave an analogy, stating that if someone stole an axe from someone's house and used it to kill someone, should the owner of the axe be held responsible? The car owner's car was parked in the garage, and he did not know that Jin had driven it out on his own. Jin Genxiang alone should be responsible. The Chinese and Western judges adjourned the court and said they would review and make a judgement.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Found Not Guilty of Robbery</h3>
<p>Rickshaw puller Shen Wenhuan was previously accused by Dai Ji, an official from the Shanghai Special City Finance Bureau, of colluding with robbers to steal clothes and silver. When questioned, Shen Wenhuan denied the accusation. The judge ordered an investigation before further review. Recently, another summons was received, but the plaintiff did not appear. The Western detective reported that there was no evidence of collusion between the defendant and the robbers. The judge was asked to review the case. Shen Wenhuan confessed that he took a shortcut to save time and would not dare to collude with robbers. He requested a clear investigation. Judge Zhu ruled that there was insufficient evidence, dismissed the case, and released the defendant.</p>
<h3>Private Opium Den Fined</h3>
<p>Wang Huanran, Wang Xingsheng, and a woman named Wang Zhou, recently opened a private opium den in the French Concession, selling opium and providing lamps for smoking, violating the prohibition. The detectives discovered this, seized the opium paraphernalia, and took them to the police station. They were brought to the French Concession Court for investigation. The head detective explained the situation first. When questioned, the defendants confessed to illegally selling opium and providing lamps for smoking. The Chinese and Western judges fined each of them 75 yuan, which was confiscated, and the opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>

The robbers fired two shots when leaving, but fortunately no one was injured. In Wan Southwest Township, Wan Town North, at the home of farmer Shen Rongchun in Shenjia Village, more than ten robbers speaking in a northern Jiangsu accent (some with queues) suddenly arrived at around 11:00 PM the night before. They wielded knives and wooden sticks and robbed the residents.

When the town's security corps and the First Garrison of the Third Branch of the County Public Security Bureau heard the alarm and went to pursue the robbers, they had already fled far away, and it was difficult to capture them in the dark night, allowing them to escape.</p>
