<p>時評</p>
<h3>倫敦公約成立後之太平洋</h3>
<p>此次倫敦會議之結果。關於法意方面之歐洲問題。均未有所解决。而於英美日方面。則較有具體辦法。質言不。不啻僅成一三國協定耳。查此次倫敦會議之發起。本以英美日爲主體。目光皆注集於太平洋方面之制海權。故當時論者。均以爲此次會議之惟一難關。在美日間相互之爭。實亦即以太平洋方面之商業權。爲其最主要之目的。皆不願稍有所放棄。乃不意昔所惴惴焉視爲惟一之難關者。今竟先得告一段落。且皆表示躊躇滿志之意。日本濱口。極極端表示歡迎贊美。而美之史汀生。更表滿意於得與太平洋對岸之良隣。制定海軍關係。謂吾美常以遠東之安全與進步爲望。今後雙方友誼。决可繼續發展。蓋其所以躊躇滿志者。即在於此也。然試思太平洋方面。爲彼兩國所注目者。非即我中國乎。非即以我中國爲極好角逐之商塲乎。歐戰以前。中國之商業權。爲英國所獨操。歐戰以後。美日繼起。激勵制造。工商業突飛猛進。競以我國爲其貨物之消納地。商業權之競爭旣起。不得不競爭海權。以保護其商業。此海軍競造戰艦之所由來也。海軍競爭不已。財力旣慮不敷。戰禍又虞復起。於是不得已而議所以限制。今競造戰艦之限制。雖稍告成功。然競爭商業之心。豈能隨之俱已。况當各國經濟衰落之際。愈以競爭商業爲其自救之計。此後必更以遠東爲其競爭運銷之塲所。我國當此金貴潮。流值此公私俱困。對此重大壓迫之來。其將何術以謀抵制。而圖所以自存乎。我國人幸勿視爲他人事而漠然不顧也。</p>

<h3>收回威海衛交涉經過</h3>
<p>▲専約二十條協定十四條</p>
<p>▲一切建築物均無償交還</p>
<p>收回威海衛専約及協定、由中英全權代表王正廷藍溥森於十八日晚正式簽訂後、英使即於次晨電向英政府請訓、迄今尙無覆示、關於専約及協定内容、須俟英使接到覆訓、再與王外長約定日期、同時在倫敦南京兩地正式發表、預計在數日内即可公布、據外部方面消息、此事當一九二一年華府會議時、奠國代表巴爾福雖有將該港交還中國之表示、但尙附有種種條件、如許英國海軍前往避署、英人可參與該埠市政行政權、准英海軍在該港海面訓練等項、此後經一九二四年一九二五年之兩度交涉、協訂草案、然均未能脱去以前之束縛、迨至今年、由外長王正廷與英使藍溥森往返磋商、於二月十三日簽訂草約、呈送中英政府核准、而英使仍力主依照一九二五年顧維鈞議定之草約、正式簽訂、我方則堅决拒絶、並聲述中國政府决將威海衛收回改爲軍港之政策、英使無詞反對、此項交涉、乃於本月十八日告一結束、雖専約内容未能完全貫澈我方之主張、然而較之一九二五年協商之草約、確有顯然之進步、蓋因此次係將收回威海衛與租借劉公島分開談判、乃訂收回威海衛専約二十條、租借劉公島協定（即合同）十四條、至於收回威海衛之辦法、爲無代價的收回、不但對於一九二五年草約所規定英人要求參與市政行政之條件、完全取消、即英國在該埠之國家建築物、如水線電線電話電燈陸地房屋水中浮標等、均無償交還中國、其他外人私產、則暫爲承認保留、設我國一旦决定建築軍港時、亦可立刻給價收回、次如劉公島租借十年之協定、我方初本不擬另訂此種合同、繼而擬訂租借五年、奈經英公使再三要求、謂租借十年、並非英政府外交部之意旨、實爲海軍部之堅决主張、請中國政府暫予通融、結果對於劉公島、仍照一九二四年舊草約之規定、租借十年、但尙有比較進步者、即（一）爲續借與否其權操之於我、（二）爲在租借期内、設我主改建軍港、可立即收回、（三）僅爲央艦避暑之用、且有夏委之限制、故我國如將威海衛改爲軍港時、對該埠即可完全封閉、不許外艦長驅直入也、</p>
<p>前日外部紀念週、王正廷對此案亦曾詳細報告、略謂、上星期五、與英使簽訂收回威海衛租借地協定全文、俟與英使約定公布日期後、再行公布、余對此頗有感想、中國喪失主權之處頗多、從未有如一八九八年之甚者、威海衛之租於英、即在是年、同時俄租旅大、德租膠澳、法租廣州灣、意大利亦甚至欲租三門灣、該年中國所受瓜分之危險實甚、可謂中華民族及國家最危險之時期、考各國之租借吾土地也、各有作用、英之作用、與俄德異、因俄租旅大、德租膠澳、英爲本身計、不得不租威海衛、以爲抗耳、吾人回溯旣往、良用痛心、是年該約成立、言明二十五年爲期、須俄還旅大、則威海衛方可收回、中國受壓迫旣甚、因生仇視外人之心、一九○○年拳菲倡亂、即種困於是、此次英國貫澈華府會議之提議、毅然交還威海衛、可爲我國收回租借地之嚆矢、此項協定、雖在一九二四年曁一九二五年間立有草約、而延至今日始克簽訂者、其癥結在劉公島上一部份房屋、借與英國水兵夏季居住之問題、爲期十年、但得展期、而中國政府聲明無故不得拒絶、余對此認爲不妥、以爲不必另訂此種合同、繼以五年爲期、終未能一致、實爲美中不足之處、但爲期雖係十年、然續借與否、其權完全操之於我、較前所擬定之草約、相去甚遠矣、至交回威海衛爲一事、借用房屋又爲一事、不可混爲一談、此次會商、即將二事分議、所訂協定、係無償交回、包括一切由英國政府所建築之設備、如水線電線電燈及陸上房屋水中浮標等、查威海衛一部份本爲商場、一部份爲軍港、此約訂後、不僅謂主權能以收回、亦可云吾國得一良好軍港、因雙方已約定吾國無論何時、可完全改作軍港之用、届時所有外國商人均須遷移、余極希望吾國海軍努力整頓、增加噸數、以利用此良好之軍港也、</p>
<h3>德州濟南間交通狀况</h3>

<h3>浙省變通取締迷信物辦法</h3>

<h3>討論華僑敎育</h3>
<p>▲除經費保留外照審查報告</p>
<p>通過</p>
<p>次議改進並發展華僑敎育計劃、主席俟鄭洪年審查報告畢、即問會員有何意見時、衛挺生謂因本日時間少而議案多、請求各會員簡單發表意見、以省時間</p>
<p>錢鶴起謂、敎育部華僑敎育司職務重要、故必須請求敎育部於最短時間實現、原案第三條經費項下、中央每年支撥五十萬元之費、應完全用於辦理海外華僑敎育之用、至甲節培養華僑師資可删去、因培養華僑師資費用、不能在中央支撥五十萬元之内動用、應删去、由敎育部另列預算、得劉士木附議、</p>
<p>鍾榮光謂、實施敎育、首重培養師資、萬萬不能删去培養華僑資一項、</p>
<p>錢鶴謂、本席非不贊成培養華僑師資、惟培養華僑師資之費用、不在中央五十萬内支撥、</p>
<p>衛挺生謂、本條不成重大問題、祇須中央支撥之欵、自五十萬加至六十萬、並指定十萬元爲培養華僑師資費用、則本問題即可解决、</p>
<p>主席金曾澄謂、本節費用、由中央支撥而分配、故不必討論、</p>
<p>歐元懹謂、本章除經費一點保留外、其餘可付表决、得多數附議、</p>
<p>鄭洪年謂、本條之五十萬元、已由中央列入十九年度預算、至支配則當由敎育部主持、至如何培養華僑師資、亦應由敎育部主持、</p>
<p>主席以歐元懹之提議付表决、得多數通過、</p>
<h3>蒙藏組報告</h3>
<p>主席馬鶴天登臺報告謂、本組共開五次會議、其詳細見另文、至修正重要之點、則有五點、附載於下、</p>
<p>一·改省各地方的蒙藏敎育行政機關、應由各該長官秉承省敎育廳組織之各種敎育行政受敎育廳之監督指導、</p>

<p>衛挺生謂、所以設學生管理機關爲保護學生指導學生之機關、其性質彷彿留學生監督機關、不可缺少、與蒙藏敎育司及蒙藏委員會之屬於行政機關者不同、又北平方面、從前對於蒙藏學生、每不設特殊班次、收效甚少、故修正案第三點、即注敎爲蒙藏學生謀求學便利、同時爲内地學生、亦能熟悉蒙藏情形、</p>
<p>陳劍翛謂、本案可請主席即付表决、</p>
<p>鄭洪年謂蒙藏敎育願注意生產方面、</p>
<p>黄廷中謂第三條北平二字、應改爲北京因北京大學有文學系之故、</p>
<p>陳劍翛謂、北平二字、本北京之誤、因北京大學之改名、恐爲人所不注意、</p>
<p>吳鶴齡謂、原案實施普通敎育辦法第五條、應加「原有北平蒙議學校亦應同時充實之」</p>

<p>趙迺傅謂現今所討論者、均枝節問題、除枝節、可由財政部討論、不必討論、</p>
<p>朱經農謂、沙田問題可保留、請専家解决後、由敎育部再核定、少數未通過、仍保留原案、「沙田官荒收入以五成歸中央三成歸省、二成歸縣市、（特别市三成餘歸中央）支配、</p>

<h3>大會宣言</h3>
<p>▲本届會議爲今後二十年努力方向</p>
<p>▲决定方案之主要精神與其注重點</p>
<p>▲要從辛苦艱難中使方案整個實現</p>
<p>▲今後指導學生應取積極負責態度</p>
<p>上海特别市敎育局長陳德徴宣讀第二次全國敎育會議宣言修止正通過如下、</p>
<p>自從第一次全國敎育會議確定以三民主義爲敎育宗旨我們全部的敎育、已有了一致的蘄向、及至北伐完成訓政開始、大家一方面歡欣鼓舞地感到一種更始振作的新機、一方面更深切地認旘關係民族文化根本的敎育、有順應着這個新機加緊推進的必要、中國國民黨第三次全國代表大會、旣確定了中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針、第二次中央全體會議、又議决於十九年春間、召集第二次全國敎育會議、並且規定在會議召集前、由敎育部組織敎育方案編製委員會、製成實行整頓及發展全國敎育之方案、由此我們可以很明顯地看出這一次會議、是和訓政建國的工作相符應、也就應當和訓政建國的步驟相一致、會議中所要討論的、不是廣泛的方針和原則、而是分期分項的實施方案、換言之、不僅是討論應當如何做、而是研究怎様做纔做得通這便是第二次全國敎育會議的性質和召集的由來現在我們已遵照中央的决議自四月十五日起至二十三日止、在首都舉行了九天的會議、到會會員一百零六人、把敎育部延聘専家詳細製定的改進全國敎育、方案共計十章、逐一加以討論和議决關於實施黨義敎育亦已呈請中央審擬加入全方案之首、此外還决議了幾件的要案、也都和方案直接間接有關、這次會議的結果待中央核定以後、就可作爲今後二十年内我們一致努力的方向、現在會議結束、敬將方案的精神和本會議認爲實施這個方案的條件、向全國同胞作一個槪括的陳述、上一個懇切的祈願</p>
<p>這次會議的方案、分看雖有十章、但合起來是整個的、方案的編製是就全國敎育、作一個通盤的打算、力矯各不相謀的弊病、所以各章各節、完全是互相關聯、所有的精神、也是全體一貫、我們在議决全方案時、有兩點特别注里、一是依據事實需要、分定時期步驟、二是根據敎育宗旨力求實現主義、關於第一點、主案的精神、是在根據現在和將來的需要、分定出先後緩急、尤其在訓政六年期内、我們深切感到全國有百分之八十以上不識字的民衆和大多數、没有受敎育機會的兒童、是推行訓政和建設的障礙、也就是推進民族文化的大阻力、所以在訓政六年期内、對於義務敎育和成年補習敎育、主盡量推進、而對於中等敎育和高等敎育、主整理充實、先求質量的提高、不遽作數量的增進、固然爲應目前最迫切的需要、應該以大部分物質精神的力量、集中在義務敎育和成年補習敎育上面、但爲提高文化的程度、中等敎育和高等敎育、在目前也確實有整理實的必要、所以這兩方面、並不相反而實相成、關於第二點、我們爲求民生的發展、所以在各級各類的敎育内、都注重科學實騐、培養生產能力、養成職業技能、我們爲求民權的普遍、所以在社會敎育和成年補習敎育計劃内注重公民訓練、而在各級學校敎育内、也注重規律和團體恊作習慣的養成、以植運用四權的基礎、我們爲完全逹到民族的獨立、所以在社會敎育和學校敎育内、注重民族獨立的精神並規定初等敎育、不應讓外國人士來代勞、尤其爲實現民族主義、鞏固國家主權、對於華僑敎育和蒙藏敎育、主張用國家力量來扶助和推進、我們更爲顧到整個的三民主義敎育的實現、必須以大多數人民爲對象、所以對於社會敎育的設施、有分期擴充的規定、並且議决了推行注音識字運動的方案、請敎育當局以積極的提倡、</p>
<p>以上約略地把本會議决定方案的主要精神和注重點叙述了、我們認爲這一個二十年期的方案是一個根據事實而定的最低限度的方案、但在我國經濟落後人才缺乏的狀况下、要實施這一部方案、確是一件十分艱重的工作、必須要敎育者大家有責任的自覺、黨國政府用全力來領導督促、全國同胞、確認爲百年大計而一致恊作、才有按期實施的希望、因此我們希望全國的敎育者、應當確認犧牲是我們的本分、敎育是一種靖獻國家的事業、而不僅僅是一種職業、必須如此纔能提起敎育界的精神、克服一切的障礙和困難、從辛苦艱難中、使方案整個的實現、我們希望政府能不辭任何艱難、就本方案所定的預算内籌足必需的經費、並且實行保障敎費的獨立、使得現有的整理和逐期的改進、都不受絲毫的影響、我們更希望政府訂定並實施敎育人員保障的辦法、使實施方案時、不致因人員更迭而遇到停頓和更變、也不使敎育界再發生校長跟着主管行政人員更動、敎育跟着校長更動的現象、必須如此纔有安心負責實行、各級各段計劃的人、也纔有必要限度内充足的費用、我們又希望全國的同胞、認定敎育的責行、並不是學敎育的所獨有、在我國目前的狀况下、敎育確實比任何事業都重要、古人説敎養兼施、我們的情形是不敎將無以爲養、在常人或以爲先富後敎、我們的國倩、是不能容許敎育事業再有片刻的延緩和等待、所以又必須全國人人引敎育爲自身的責任、而後中國纔有敎育談、</p>

<p>我們這一次會議中、黨國先進和中央當局、都從百忙中親臨會議、對我們有懇切詳盡的指導、當局對於敎育的重視、使我們十分的感奮興起、我們一方面對所有的指導表示極誠懇的接受、同時我們更確認敎育是建設國家推進文化的根本、不僅要有方案、也要有適應空間時間的特具的精神、我國敎育上從前放任因循的慣習、人自爲政的風氣、已使國家民族受很顯著的影響、今後對於學生生活的指導、無疑地應取積極負責的態度、盡誘導扶掖的努力、而有當無計劃無方法的讓其自由發展、我們在這様的國家環璄之下、唯有以銜鋒陷陣的氣槪、揩毁過去一切弊害、確立刻苦嚴謹的規律生活、養成發皇蓬勃的向上精神、我們以爲要實現救國建國的道途在此、要增進國家民族在文化上的地位、也不外乎此、謹此宣言、（起草委員陳布雷楊銓吳敬恒陳德徴孟憲承）</p>

<p>▲以後革新計劃努力改進</p>
<p>四川敎育廳代表曾廣銘、昨與記者談話、錄之如下、</p>
<p>記者問（一）貴省每年均有軍事、對於敎育、有無影響、曾答、影響甚大、近年各軍防區制行敎育事業、益棼如亂絲、譬如各級學校校長、照章應由省敎育行政長官、按照資格學識、量予任用、乃防軍長官、各自爲政、所有各該防區内校長、均係自由任免、資格如何、學識如何、省敎育行政長官、均無從查考、以故敎育當局雖欲整理革新、而政令不能實施、頗爲進行之障礙耳、</p>
<p>問（二）省立大學已設立否、内容如何、答、現公立四川大學、即係省立共設五院、有工科學院、農科學院、中國文學院、外國文學院、法政學院、</p>

<h3>南通敎育槪况（宋禀恭</h3>
<p>▲敎費尙待增籌</p>
<p>▲學校逐漸擴充</p>
<p>▲社敎機關完全</p>
<p>江蘇南通自張嗇公、首行創辦師範學校、樹敎育根本大計以來、積三十年之經營、各項設施、得有相當之基礎、革命後、庶政維新、復賴行政當局、積極指導、地方人士、熱心贊助、敎育人員、繼續努力、實行增籌敎育經費、厲行敎育普及政策、敎育經費、年有增加、敎育事業、日益進展、近更增闢經費來源、以備實施普及敎育、此項計劃、如能完全實現、九年之間、全縣敎育、或可幾乎普及、茲將最近槪况述之於於次、</p>

<h3>敎育意見書（五）高君珊</h3>
<p>▲民衆敎育課程的商榷案</p>
<p>（一）理由</p>
<p>（一）民衆學校的、課程雖然各地施行時稍有進出但因仿尋常各級學校的通例、故祇有一種爲男女學生所同用、但民衆敎育與尋常學校的敎育不同、有些現做現賣的性質、而且學生多是成年的人、所以同時之間、都有他們的業務、各種的職業、姑且暫置不論、即以婦女而言、他們所需要的敎材一定與男子不同、這些婦女大多數是爲人妻人母、而且一切家務事、須要親自去做的、此外或另兼其他賺薪工的職業、他們所最需要的敎材、當然是嬰孩保育法、及家庭衛生等等、就是極小的事、如如何洗掉衣服上的油跡或如何使兒童有早膳的皆慣、比之識了千字課中最初的一百字、恐怕　要重一點罷、我們往往一説到敎育　字、就要聯想到讀書、好像敎育同讀書是二而一的、實際上敎育的涵義至廣、這種文字的敎育在民衆學校中、一大半的目的、不過是給與他們一種工具而已、這種工具應占各級學校課程中、何種重要的位置、須看在那一種狀况之下、及在那一種人的身上、有時實用的敎材、比之工具的敎材爲重要、那一班到民衆學校裹來民年長失學的婦女、認識了幾個字、不知道那一天才有機會去讀一封信、但是得到了保育嬰兒的智識、下課時跑回家裹去、就可以在他的小孩身上去應用了、所以婦女的敎材、有一部份應當改訂一下、</p>
<p>（二）學習成績的高下、以學者當時的態度爲轉移、如學的時候覺得有一種急切的需要、當然能够集中他的注意力、而感到濃厚的興趣、工具的、敎材往往不及實用的敎材、能引人的興趣、就是因爲前者離應用的機會較遠、後者不但是有目的學習、而且立刻可以去應用、兒童有此種的心理、而成人更爲顯著、所以課程以多含實用的知識爲主、而婦女的敎材、應當同他們的實際生活相聯絡、因此就不能與男子同用一種的課程了、</p>
<p>（二）辦法</p>
<p>（南京光華攝）</p>
<p>請民衆敎育専家、詳細研究年長失學的婦女、所需要的實用的知識和技能、然後去改良課程的内容、務使敎材適合他們的興趣、而且所學適於所用（一九三○年二月十八日於北美洲）（完）</p>
<h3>魯省大學敎育何思源</h3>
<p>▲歷年來大學之沿革</p>
<p>▲現在僅有齊魯大學</p>
<p>▲希望速成國大靑大</p>
<p>（一）前清時代</p>
<p>前清末年、山東出鉅金創辦高等學堂、在濟南西關桿石橋外購地建築校舍、備極寛敝、凡自來水發電機等均係單置設備、並設一天文台、堂時在山東境内、以設備及功課論、外推巨擘、其中班次共有三種、最高一種與大學預科等、雖得時號稱山東之最高學府、實不足與正式之大學敎育比也、</p>
<p>（二）民元至民十四之間</p>
<p>省立之高等學堂、在此期間停辦、雖以省欵設立専門學校數處、但對於大學敎育、則公認爲無力及此、故未曾有若何之計劃、時山東境内之敎會學校、將濰縣靑州等處程度較高之學生集結於濟南、在城南購地建築極弘大之校舍、設齊魯大學、最初止有神醫兩科、後又設文理兩科、特質設備、頗稱完善、一時爲山東境内唯一無二之大學、</p>
<p>（三）民十四至民十七之間</p>
<p>高恩洪充膠澳督辦時、與宋傅典等假靑島市内之萬年兵營（此係日人命名德人原名俾斯麥兵營）創辦私立靑島大學、設土木工程鐵路管理及商科、該校地點極佳、環境極美、惜係私立、爲經費所限、不能發展、此校雖膠澳區内、原不隷屬山東、但至張宗昌督魯時將靑島改爲普通、市鎭歸省轄、故該校仍可視爲山東境内之大學、張宗昌在魯期間、將原有之農工商法醫礦六専門學校合併、改爲省立山東大學、至是所有省欵設立之大學、山大設農工法醫文各科、時主壽彭爲魯敎育廳長、徒知尊經、輕視科學、故省立山大各科之實際情形、極不完善、在此期内、山東境内之號稱大學者爲上述之齊大靑大山大三校、</p>
<p>（四）民十七以後</p>
<p>十七所國軍北伐、張逆敗逃、五三變起、省立山大即歸停頓、當時大學院令在山東籌設國立山東大學、舊有之山大校產等、完全收歸國立山大、自十七年夏至十八年夏、因濟案尙未解决、舊有省立山大仍由魯敎育廳負責派員暫行保管、國立山東籌委會未能前往接收、</p>
<p>十八年五月、魯省府遷至濟南、國立山大籌委會亦由泰移濟、六月中、即由魯省及敎廳派員將省立山大校產移交國立山大籌委會、該會即分别接收、着手進行整理、以利籌備、旋奉敎育部命令、將國立山東大學改爲國立靑島大學、籌委會亦改組爲國立靑大籌委會、除舊省立山大之校產仍歸國立靑大外、在靑島之私立靑島大學飭即停辦、將校產交由國立靑大接收使用、</p>
<p>七月初旬、國立靑大籌委會全體委員大靑島開會、議决進行籌備之具體計劃、因時日所限、十八年度上學期不能開學、將舊山大及舊時靑大原有學生介紹至他處大學轉學、至國立靑大則擬設文理農工四學院、並附設農事試騐場一、及化學機械染織工廠各一、蓋欲利用以前各専校之舊有設備也、當即擬具預算、呈部核示、共計經費六十四萬餘元、臨時費四萬餘元、開辦費在外、在籌備期間（即十八年七至十九年六月）魯省府協助經費十二萬元、靑島市政府協助三萬餘元、膠濟路局協助亦約三萬元、十八年秋、開辦補習班、招收合於大學一年級新生資格之學生、在靑島校舍上課、將國文外國文及數理等科目分别補習、十九年度考試及格、即准入大學一年級肄業、已招足文理補習班各一班、上課一學期餘矣、十九年春、因在濟各工廠機件日漸銹損、即議决將各廠同時開辦、業已實行、十九年度擬即正式招收新生、成立大學、山東省前因境内無適宜之大學、各校學生均赴外省外埠各大學升學、故由省欵項下每年支出省外各大學魯籍學生補助費一宗、十八年度及十九年度各五萬元、此種辦法、仍屬所補無幾、故於十九年度省敎育經費内支出三十六萬元（經常二十八萬、臨時八萬）協助國立靑大、期其能如期成立、免魯省靑年學子相率失學也、蓋在國立靑大未成立之先、魯省僅餘一敎會設立之齊魯大學、該校去歲曾請立案、惟以手續未備及校内仍有不合規章之處、故未爲轉呈、嗣後該校即發生風潮、除醫科外、餘均幾同停辦、故國立靑大更有早日成立之必要也、</p>

<h3>熊式輝時局談</h3>
<p>▲中央現仍希望和平</p>
<p>▲五師部隊努力剿匪</p>
<p>淞滬警備司令熊式輝、偕同秘書陳澤寛、昨晨七時、由京乘夜車抵滬、昨日下午本報記者訪晤之於寓次、據云、此次應蔣主席電召晋京、報告一切、並無何項特别任務、</p>
<p>▲檢閲部隊　又謂蔣主席赴漢、係檢閲武漢部隊、及預備一切軍事上之佈置、嚴防馮軍南下、倘馮不進攻、則蔣俟佈置妥善後、十日中定可返京、</p>
<p>▲徐蚌安謐　蚌埠及徐州間、中央防務鞏固、現狀極爲安謐、孫殿英軍確曾一度侵蚌、經包圍擊潰、早無踪跡、</p>
<p>▲仍望和平　記者旋叩以對北方軍事之意見、熊謂、中央仍希望和平、對北軍事取守勢、不進攻、閻馮裂痕極多、雜牌軍隊不過爲一時的結合、即閻馮部下亦多受壓迫、非出自願、故最近期中、内部定必破裂、中央坐以待變、若目下以武力解决、徒苦吾民、結果則一也、</p>
<p>▲剿匪澈底　熊氏又謂、中央現努力於建設工作、使民衆得以安居樂業、余亦本此宗旨、第五師部隊、澈底剿匪、迭據剿匪司令胡祖玉電告、業已完全剷平、僅少數竄至廣德、正在追剿、即不在本部淞滬轄境區内、亦責無旁貸、如江北多匪等處、亦有五師隊伍在彼協剿、總之、剿匪務期盡絶、决不虚張聲勢、貽留後患、</p>

<h3>浙江移民改明晨出發</h3>
<p>▲因廣利球日船延誤</p>
<p>此次浙省移民出關、開東南各省墾荒殖邊之先例、故浙省府辦理此事、十分愼密、先派専員赴東省調查後、又續派委員留遼、照料災民入境等事、第一批出關之人、原擬昨日出發、茲因船舶誤期、遂延遲兩天、今已准定明日、送往瀋陽、茲將續聞種種、分記如下、</p>
<p>▲廣利救日船誤期　已經到温州之災民五百餘人、早經招商局電令廣利輪、往載來滬、原定二十二日晨在温州開出、昨日到上海、過船出發、不意二十一日據廣利輪電告、謂在汕頭方面之東蘭木海島燈塔畔、接得無綫電求救信號、知日輪神吉丸、在小舟島觸礁沉失、島上有日水手一名待救、廣利船主、本航海協助之義務、駛往該島、將日水手一名救出、（其餘大部分水手、是否溺斃、在海尙出知）、以神吉丸不走上海、故廣利又開往厦門、送日人上陸、及至昨日、始由厦門開到温州、而已在下午矣、在温州之移民、不及久待、遂改船先期來滬、</p>
<p>▲災民乘海晏來滬　在温災民、因廣利輪誤期、即由移送委員由温發電來滬、請駐滬助理委員周柏桐、向招商局磋商、由營業科沈仲毅接洽、當以廣利爲日船海難而延誤、須緩四十八小時到温州、恐妨碍移運日期、遂由沈君立電温州海晏輪、着令該船少搭旅客、先載災民五百餘人至滬、一面通知周柏桐、告以二十五日晨必到、其已經到上海之一批、今日可先下華陽輪、候明晨災民到齊、上午即可出口赴營口矣、</p>
<p>▲首批缺額之原因　第一批移民、原定一千四百至一千五百名、今祇有八百餘人出關者、其缺額之原由、因移民委員會所派往遼寗接洽移墾之張委員、近日忽有電報發來、謂邇日該處之墾荒區域内、已在引水入田、種植糧食蒔秧之際、如災民多去、亦以植種過時、無田可墾、請首批移民、减少名額、俟第二批時再多送、斯則不致災民到後空閑、因之今次乃减少名額、其留而未遺者、俟下次送去、</p>
<p>▲移民分組集管理　今因移送之災民、由委員會議定沿途出發時、分成組集兩種、大致每災民五户至十户爲一小組、設一組長、再由五六小組而編成一小集、設正副集長各一人、其組長集長等、即將災民中選任、其組屬于集、而集則隷于管理委員、各災民均由委員會發給移</p>

<h3>趙鐵橋整理招商局</h3>
<p>▲分三個時期進行</p>
<p>▲第一步已在整理</p>
<p>招商局此次改組情形、已誌本報、該局於局務上、營業上、所擬定之廣展計劃、與我國之航運權上、有深切之關係、茲就各項辦法、就所知者、摘誌槪况如下、</p>
<p>▲整理之步趨　該局總、辦趙鐵橋、　　整理局務之步趨、分爲三個時期、第一期、先將商局之本身、確定爲國有、以現有商股爲四萬四千股、照現時市價估計、每股約值五十元、即照市價收買、約需二百餘萬、而局内之附屬產業、則歸局中收買、按照當時購進之價格、給付現金、所有收買商股、不妨給發公債、即以債劵換取股票、而將買下之產業、（即積餘公司之碼頭、地產等、照原價不過四百餘萬兩、）以之抵押、至少可得一千萬兩、償還舊欠之匯豐花旗等各外債、使經濟担負可輕而有活動之資矣、</p>
<p>▲船舶之添造　該局現有二十五輪、總計三萬七千二百三十八噸、其中如江天·江裕·海晏·廣大·廣利·圖南等、均在四十五年以上之年齡、耗煤大而損失巨、應速廢去、改爲躉駁之用、實際可用之船、祇二萬八千噸、不及太古怡和等行十分之一運量、現所需要者、爲純粹運貨之商輪、而亟須添建者、（甲）裝貨海輪五艘、每船三千五百凈噸、（乙）裝貨江輪兩隻、各二千凈噸、（丙）川江淺水柴油引擎輪二隻、各四百噸、（丁）海州綫淺水輪兩隻、各一千一百噸、（戊）拖輪五隻、鐵駁十五隻、各四百噸、又自動駁船三隻、各三百噸、另再添普通拖駁二十三隻、各三百噸、統計應添之船、約計三萬四千餘噸、此爲現時發展各路營業上之最少的限度、</p>
<p>▲碼頭之改建　招商局有南·北·中·華·新·五個碼頭、多是年久失修、傾圯不堪、第一步整理、應先改造永久碼頭、並建新式貨棧、好在五棧均在𤀹浦局之標準岸綫内、茲擬將各棧之岸壁水地、盡行升科、向外移至標準綫、即建水泥鋼骨之永久碼頭、而船舶可直接靠岸、上落貨件、旣便又速、沿街背面之地、可售與人造市房、得價充升科用·中·南·北·華·新五棧、共長五千四百尺、造永久碼頭、每丈建築費、平須三千兩、需欵一百六十二萬兩、又各棧附建之三層新貨棧、每日尺作一棟計、南棧可造四棟、北棧可造六棟、華棧可造十棟、新棧亦可造十棟也、建造費八萬五千兩、一經落成、可以容貨十二萬噸之巨、每年收入之棧租、非常可觀、</p>
<p>▲三步之計劃　三步計劃中、第一時期、刻下已在進行改良者、（一）改善會計、（二）擴充營業、（三）精密統計、（四）整理船棧、（五）編制預算、（六）清查局產、而繼續此第一步之計劃、以跟進者、即爲籌劃低利資金、辦理車船聯運、廢老船·添新輪·修棧·建埠·造躉船、補充各輪設備、開海州航綫、培植専才、請政府補助、而第三步計劃則更大、惟實施期則較遠、其擬定者、爲擴充内河航綫、增開外洋輪船、海外添建碼頭、設立造船廠·及船塢·請政府保護航業、而三項計劃中、則先着手辦理一二兩步、苟能在短時期内實現、則中國航運史上、亦可呈一異彩也、</p>

<p>▲先審訊通姦案　衛氏控程虐待遺棄請求離婚之案、日前已由特區地方法院一度開庭、因程亦以刑事控衛素勤與葛玉明通姦、並捲逃之案、尙未審訊、故由法官諭將該民事案展期、昨日午後、仍由特區地方法院刑事法庭許家栻庭長先審程所控之通姦案、</p>

<p>乙｜豈有此理。我倘遇見他時。一定打他一頓。</p>
<p>甲｜不用你費心。我早已打過他了、因爲我自已覺得生得還不討壓。怎麽會像起你來。</p>
<p>▲甲｜你現在還在學油畫麽。</p>

<h3>醫學新識</h3>
<p>— 黎叔平</p>
<p>柏林威嚴醫院華斯曼博士。近爲醫學界作一勇敢驚奇之新供獻。自以軟橡皮管。由肘腕靜脈管引入心房右端之小孔。歷小六時有半。而心房與脈管未曾發生任何危險變態。博士證明由此注射藥劑入於心房及臟腑各部。較之他處爲安全迅速。皮管由肘及心。僅須三四杪鐘。病人施用麻醉劑後。若以此器注射。十分鐘即能清醒云。</p>
<p>巴黎皮膚病醫生慕望。極言肥皂不可多用。因現代肥皂所含香料及鹼性過强。足以阻礙吾人皮膚之天然營養與保護力。而易於致病。最好用以洗滌毛巾及衣服。而不使與皮膚發生直接關係。已患皮膚病者。則絶對忌用肥皂。非惟無益。反足致害也。</p>
<p>柏林大學微菌學系敎授阿本伊蒙博士。於上課時講演其醫學之新經騐。甚能引起學生之興趣。博士謂患肺病者對於所着衣服之顏色。應特别注意。最忌者爲靑紅諸深色。以其能阻止光線透過。白色則其爲適宜。次之若淺藍淺紫亦可。總之以易於通透光線爲善。使日光與皮膚接觸。而實施其殺菌之效力焉。</p>
<p>法國三醫學敎授發明一防禦肺病傅染之新方法。係用殺菌藥粉自呼吸器輸入。聞此種新法。已試用二百人以上。皆係與患肺病人時常接近者。同時復以同様之藥用種痘法施於另數十人。亦使與肺癆病人接近。前者結果甚良好。惟用注射法收效稍遜耳。</p>
<h3>鄭鷷鴣先生追悼會雜感</h3>
<p>— 蔡楚生</p>
<p>昔歲客南中。以素志酷好戲劇。研討之餘。因甚注意於海上藝術界之現狀友有自滬歸者。輙聞藉藉稱道鷓鴣先生。每爲心往神馳。不能自已。民十七間萍踪至滬。乃聞先生已歸道山。以藝術事業又乏一努力之中堅份子。爲傷悼者久之。比去歲就明星公司事。始與先生哲嗣世煇君識。世煇君待人接特。和靄可親。辦事尤富毅力。同事每爲述世煇君之敦厚饒有父風。乃深慶先生之有後也。本月二十日爲先生逝世後五週之期。事前其老友如張石川鄭正秋周劍雲董天涯諸君。以先生窀穸未安。殊不足以慰其在天之靈。因卜地於萬國公墓、於日昨舉行安葬。並在萬國公墓禮堂中開追悼大會。除明星公司之全體同人蒞塲外。親友之到會者亦不少。凌晨在地行禮。靈櫬由禮堂中移出。奏哀樂後。始徐徐移置壙中。至是素來慣作嬉笑之男女明星。亦皆垂首沉默。且有繼以啜泣者。我知各人之腦海中當有不少悲哀與感想之來龔也。比棺下。石川與正秋二先生以事遲至。見老友已爲黄土所掩。乃不禁爲之淚下焉。</p>
<p>九時在禮堂中致祭如儀。十時追悼會開幕。首由主席正秋先生報告開會理由。並謂以鷓鴣先生之經騐學識。苟天假以年。於我藝術界必更有偉大之貢獻。故先生之死。不僅爲明星之損失。亦吾全藝術界之損失也云云。至悲切處輙哽咽幾不成聲。想見其當年交好之切也。旋由陸潤靑君報告先生行狀。周劍雲君演講先生努力之歷略、於先生之刻苦自勵。與爲大多數人之利益而奮鬥之精神。闡明尤力。周君先生交其密。故知之獨詳。而念及私人交誼。遂亦淚隨聲下矣。次爲張石川君演説。張君於明星公司締造之艱難歷程中。與先生相聚之日爲最多。比明星漸臻發逹。而先生竟棄其老友而去。故張君述及在明星未曾發逹以前。與先生及諸人伏屋中通宵籌劃之困苦。乃爲之熱淚縱横。遂掩面而下。此時全塲但聞啜泣聲。更無人能起而一展辭鋒者。經數分鐘之靜默後。乃由世煇君作答辭及主席致閉幕辭而散。</p>
<h3>鼠子作賊之奇聞</h3>
<p>— 張炎</p>
<p>鼠。小獸也。穴處人之家屋。恃竊食以生活。至損毁器具。嚙破衣履。尤爲慣技。故人家多蓄貓以捕之。吾友何君。近獲鼠竊雞蛋之奇案。頗堪發喴。以老鼠而能作賊、實所罕見。爰錄投本談。以博一粲。</p>
<p>同事何小雲君。每早　沐畢。輒食生雞蛋三故。行之已久。近因天時漸熱。惟恐蛋不新鮮。每晚令役購三枚。備翌日晨餐。詎每晨開屜、常少蛋一二故。初不介意。繼以爲奇。遂欵役所爲。日昨何君欲知究竟。乃效福爾摩斯之實施偵探。正襟坐待。至深夜二時許。微聞抽屜響聲。遂屏息遙望。約二分鐘。又聞微聲切切。似有物破屜而出。何凝神一望。不禁恍然大悟。暗自發笑。蓋竊賊非他。即鼠是也。而其竊技之巧。妙不可言。係一鼠仰臥。四足緊抱一蛋。另有一鼠。以其尾倒曳而行。甚爲迅捷。何至此。不覺失聲而笑。二鼠大驚。迺舍蛋亂竄而去。</p>

<p>孝豐北天目馬鈴岡。係著名茶山。所產之茶。不下龍井。而該山之腰有一古刹。曰金光寺。寺之側。有山數畝。爲該寺之物。中有野生茶樹數十本。俱幹高枝繁。而村頭所抽之嫩葉。色白如玉。焙後微黄。泡而飲之。味清而香。誠茶舞中之奇品也。</p>
<p>該白茶名聞遐邇。孝邑各茶行。每於上年冬季爭向該寺預定。顧此茶產額不多。年祇十餘斤。故預定者每家僅獲斤許或數兩耳。而各行購得後。並非逐什一之利。乃係分贈滬寗蘇杭等處與之有交易之茶行。但每家僅贈以兩許。良以物希價昂。得之非易。按此茶之植。近年來每兩需銀一元以上云。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（十七）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>又有一種奇樹名旅行樹ＴrarellersPalm亦椰樹之一種。其樹中含漿。又名甘露樹。旅行人熱渴之極。得此樹則大喜。故名行旅行樹也。</p>
<p>二十三日出游街上。甚感困難。第一苦者。街道名稱。英漢雜用。而漠不相關。英文之音與漢字全左。且其音爲閩粤音。某路皆稱某綫。第二苦者。無漢文地圖。此地十之八皆漢人。數十年來竟無一漢文街道圖。亦文化之恥矣。可見在此地智識階級中人。除一定職業外。無人負責組織對於文化上有研究之團體。而一班營業者。只顧個人目前利害。乏遠想也。我民自治力之薄弱。於此可見。第三苦者。欲雇人力車等。無發言資格。因此間皆閩粤人。勞工界尤不道官話也。且此間洋車亦没法坐。因彼亦不大懂路。皆由坐車人識路者。命之東則東。西則西。彼對於路途。絶不負責任。過異在内地。例如呌一車。説我到北車站。中間一切。坐車人不負責任也。此事甚怪。但事實上拉車人之苦。更甚於我等。應爲彼想。吾等通漢文英文普通語。對於街上所標各字。依然不易了然。况彼等一字不識。無怪其然矣。又有一奇。則此間坐車者。大抵皆二人同車。其車較上海高大。若一人坐則爲例外也。入國問禁。入境問俗。若者中國内地。二男人坐一車。則犯警律矣。此間國語國文。缺乏統一運動。乃僑胞事業隔閡一大原因也。</p>
<p>二十四日李俊承君來訪。李爲印光法師弟子。能詩。詩近樂天。豐縟可觀。多名句。記其一句。有佳句無心得云。其摯友爲鄭子瑩。亦能詩。較李才雄健奔逸。李云。總商會將請余講演。</p>
<p>二十五日總商會坐辦。莊篤鼎莊篤明來邀講演。且云。俟在商會講演後。再應他界講演爲宜余然之。即訪商會長薛秀嵐。李偉南。</p>
<p>二十六日同李俊李君訪鄭延譧。未遇。次日。鄭持一小詩來。蓋亦李之詩友也。</p>
<p>二十七日訪各報館人。本來余甫至彼時。外報已戴余講世界女性和平主義者。中國報已將余主張改造全世界之方略發表甚多。並照余相去。西人某氏來訪。余贈以英文書囑其運動。本日張煊同志。至自香港。因其在滬同行。在港停數日。今始至也。</p>
<h3>非島華會紀實</h3>
<p>— 顏文初自菲島寄</p>
<p>菲島嘉年華會。今年又已開幕。其會塲建築。每届改換形式。以新耳目。今年爲亞剌伯古宮式。輝煌華麗。令人神往中世紀時大食國在西亞建國之雄風。全塲佈置電燈三萬五千餘盞。塲中矗立一高十餘丈之燈塔。爲全塲中心。入夜衆炬齊明。眞若城開不夜。</p>
<p>在此開幕十六日夜中。政府機關。皆懸持國旗助慶。各人員辦公時間。將上午多延長一小時。下午放假。俾得携其家人。赴會參觀各種陳列。蓋名爲狂歡節。實寓提倡工商業这意也。</p>
<p>會中除大禮堂每夜有特别節目表演外。可分爲五部。（一）各州府土產陳列。（生貨熟貨皆有）（二）政府機關陳列。（監獄出品。科學館農林局最多。）（三）商家陳列。（含有廣生性質。）（四）雜劇表演。（須另購入塲券。如毛人。肥女子。及江湖賣技者流。）（五）游戲塲。（輪迴旋轉。飛艇模型。自由汽車等類。）若以比我國去年西湖博覽會。眞有小巫大巫之别。然年年繼續。人民視爲一種令節。政府不必津貼。公司且年有赢餘。（該會爲公司性質。）故可以持久。且推行於各州府焉。</p>
<p>在開幕期内有五次大游行。皆在下午三點舉行。（一）嘉年華會游行。各界皆可加入。（二）學校游行。公立大中小學校。幾全加入。（三）海陸軍游行。（四）花后游行。（五）花車游行。每次皆有評判員。列第一二三者。皆可得獎、而商業大公司。以花車加入游行者。則皆帶有廣告性質焉。</p>
<p>選舉花后（即菲律賓女士）之權。本來初選屬之各報。複選屬於股東。今年變更手續。由該會舉評判員五位。先將各報初選入。（共二十餘人）爲二回選擇後。祇餘五人。評判員爲愼重起見。令五人各穿游泳衣。在堂内繞行數週。俾其曲線美畢露。以品定高下。詎知美人中有不願輕露色相者。聞此訓令。皆爲失色。然欲求十六日夜之虚榮。不敢不遵此握有全權評判者之命令於是出行時。皆羞澀不敢作平視。有淚如雨下者。有Ｖtoeta　Ｐez女士。本有當選希望。因嚴拒脱衣。自願放棄被選權。厥後天王敎團體。在報上登函贊美。各報亦爭刋登玉照。與中選花后并列。其精神上愉快之報酬。誠此中選者爲列榮也。</p>
<p>歷届花后加冕之夜。皆創造一歷史上故事。藉爲表演。今年所表演者。係東方一武摩士國。老蘇丹欲傅位與其單生女公主。（即花后）其條件必彼能與最奢侈之國之太子。擇其一與之結婚。故開幕時。大禮官即佈告各國太子上殿求婚。首上殿者爲中國太子。次爲印度太子。三爲亞剌伯太子。四爲菲律賓蘇丹太子。六爲西班牙太子伊沙比路。最後公主對各國求婚。皆表滿意。然因忠於其國相傅習慣。遂擇同種之菲蘇丹太子爲終身伴侶。後由其父加冕爲花后。禮成後即下殿與民衆共樂。當各國太子上殿求婚時。後隨待從四十人。各衣其國裝飾、并作其國風舞蹈。所飾中國者。皆垂辦長服。其舞蹈祇是亂跳。以我國人眼光觀之。誠不知出自何代也。</p>
<p>華會禮堂各表演中。第一有趣者爲兒童日。購入塲券一枚。可帶八歲以上十二歲以下兒童二人。其團體表演。先期報名加入。可免繳入塲券費。華僑第一女校。加入演葡萄仙子舞。大得觀者歡迎。得二獎。</p>
<p>在會塲内遇有不相識之女子。可以紙花撒頭上。藉作問訉。美國女子。或且點首道謝。遇美兵在場中游戲。張口大笑時。戲以紙花塞其口。彼亦一笑置之。近來此風稍殺。惟我華僑中不規則省年。遇婦女恒用紙花極力摔去。直欲毁其花容而後已。此種粗暴舉動。大爲菲人所壓視也。</p>
<p>一年一度各省長會議。本届遠東運動選手决賽、皆在此華會期内行之。今年多兩特别大會。一爲驅柳蟲大會。蓋近來柳子忽生一種蝗蟲。收穫鋭减。農業上受一大打擊。集各省農業専家。籌議殺蟲方法。一爲之動獨立大會。藉上表示民衆要求獨立决心。俾任請願團後盾。惟該獨立會有一趣聞。亦欲選舉花后。藉作點綴。説者謂菲屬民衆。他日希望建設眞正共和獨立國。選舉花后。帶有貴族色彩。未免與民意相矛盾。</p>
<p>本届花后爲天主敎聖兼學校HolyGhostCollege學生。該校當局。據天主敎通例。以女子穿游泳衣任人品詳爲押表。因該生以穿游泳衣。乃得當選花后。認爲有損該校尊嚴名譽。已將該生除名。敎育界分爲兩派。道學家羣起攻擊。認華會此舉爲悔辱女性。審美家則謂每當星期日早晨。海邊有大批穿遊泳衣服之靑年女子。游泳其間。不足爲奇。并責該校當局。眼光未免過狹。以三百餕年歐化之菲律賓。所舊眼光之衝突。亦在所難免。則新舊道德問題。世界誠難趨一致也。</p>

<p>▲華商抛出日金一百萬···日銀行吸進</p>
<p>昨英美印市均見放長、惟歐市平和、中印兩方互有進出、至横濱及神户等滙市頗屬庸碌、本埠滙豐掛牌外滙依然不動、而内盤英美日三滙均無變化、乃標金亦祇一兩餘赴仆也、比前日僅日金微降零六二五、英美扯平、華商投機家稍有抛出、銀行胃口尙稱不寂、計英金約出十萬鎊、由三菱·住友·安逹·麥加利等納進、又各行互做五六萬鎊、又美金賣出十餘萬元、安逹·住友吸進、而日金曾抛出一百萬元、由朝鮮·三井·台灣買進、間有大連帮售出現大連幾十萬元、以套進標金焉、市况似乎盤旋、午後因逢週三向例無市云、</p>

<p>▲釐拆價格「洋釐」早市爲七錢二分一釐八毫七忽半、與前日相若、午市人心堅俏、價格逐昂、結果收盤爲七錢二分二釐一毫二忽半、較早市改漲二毫半、「銀拆」早午市統又回落、而開二分、較前日竟跌一半光景、可見銀拆以銀根終鬆、一時總不能轉機、劃頭亦無加水而做白劃、銀行持牌又無市價矣、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗銷漸見進展</h3>
<p>▲二十支藍鳳日廠開出三千包</p>
<p>紗市平靜、趨勢安定、海外棉市頻告下跌、而本埠市氣尙佳、實以買方始終不肯放鬆、大户空頭雖有巨額交貨之意、然成交額數太巨、散户無貨者、視期限接近、祇得扒補、故市盤稍漲、紗市就實際上測之、無大漲風、不過底盤較低、使買方稍能安心、一時仍無極大變化發現也、查本月份拍板日期祇有三天、而成交數尙有二萬九千八百五十包之巨、但不知能否平靜過去耳、</p>

<h3>棉市驟轉鬆懈</h3>
<p>▲外棉電告頻跌多頭獲利了結</p>
<p>棉市轉疲、良以海外棉市連路幾日、致多頭活動了結、又以美棉報告有人批交貨、深恐外棉有連跌之可能、故獲利者乘機賣出了結、人心因此疲軟、本月份日商亦稍有放出、市上現貨生意岑寂、各廠態度異常冷靜云、</p>
<p>▲期棉回跌二錢五　漢標前市開盤、形勢尙硬、散户扒空、祇跌五分至一錢、午後獲利者了結、市氣驟爲鬆懈、各月跌一錢五分至二錢、全日成交統計三萬四千五百担、茲將漢標收盤價錄左、</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米市呆疲</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日各路來源二十餘號、市銷不暢北粳預貨不多無上落、中關去路甚呆、店胃亦不動、行情微小、宿次則疲去兩角、刻下河積之貨殊不能再擱、故米情决難向榮、薄稻本街進胃亦淡、買氣凋零、價轉呆軟、羊杜子秈脚地固穏、但買户有洋米之積貨、故無進胃、且西貢小絞午間忽跌、情勢大爲欠佳、而三秈因亦告懈、白元吊销寂寞、做開寥寥、價仍不振、</p>
<p>▲滬南　河下到貨六七號、走銷呆木、當蘇錫同等機糧因存底枯薄、情形較北市和艦、大盤平定、此間各糧可稱漲跌均屬不易、因此連日閘方雖軟、此則呆平、惟交易及斛脚甚淡耳、南帮薄稻興早晩稻晨間尙穏、旋則趨滯、價亦稱有修削、緣去化不爽也、羊杜尖銷塲略接、惟祇零拆問津、情况仍堅、通變陰元客銷平庸、來貨亦稀、市雖見定、然頗無神、</p>
<h3>麵紛回落之主因</h3>
<p>▲陳粉···廠商放鬆···實銷不願抽買</p>
<p>▲新粉···氣候甚佳···多頭漸漸回出</p>
<p>昨粉市一致回落、近期以實銷未願抽買、某廠亦放鬆一點、人心已不若前之堅挺、因陳貨到此檔口、除實銷外、投機者殊少收取現貨之能力也、至遠期各月分、因氣候仍佳、賣氣轉暢、而考新粉之行情、不但超過往年、且爲自來所罕見、至從事實上言、麥之收成、豐歉與否、目下全無根據、以米價之故、從之硬抬、於麥之本身如何、反置之度外、其爲投機作用、似已彰明較著者也、故目下因天時良好、逐步放鬆、廠客多頭亦漸漸回出、要亦高昂之新粉、得一回落之機也、結果本月份較前日小七厘半、五月份至七月份跌一分半、八月份跌一分半、九月份跌一分云、</p>
<h3>麥市期現同疲</h3>
<p>▲現麥共開七千餘包···高貨喊短三四分</p>
<p>昨日期麥均呈疲落之勢、本月份以交割在邇浮多逐步回出、至實行交割者一聞泰康須收去四十餘車、遠期以天氣甚佳、麥苗均報豐秀、兼之洋麥報價又較小二三角、故蘇常及江北一帶均抛售甚湧、惟大部分之無錫帮一仍然硬抬、但環境如是、終亦軟弱一點、結果本月份軟前日小二分、六月份小三分、七月份小二分、八月份小三分、九月份小二分、現麥亦見帶疲、以廠方祇大廠尙有去胃、中小廠均無動靜、高貨喊價又短三四分、開宿州麥、清江浦麥、蚌埠麥徐州麥五兩零五分、共開七千餘包、由福新阜豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　歐美絲銷沉寂</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊絲市、轉趨沉寂、緣海外絲織廠織造薄綢注重人造絲、致天然絲銷路减折、絲電仍鮮轉滬、市氣清疲、祖連納等進滬白廠經四十包、逹昌進川黄廠經二十包、價難看好云、</p>
<h3>遂安新綠茶已開秤</h3>
<p>遂安綠茶、自清明節、後因天時晴暖、發育異常迅速、十八日起各山户均已先後採摘、茶身尙嫩、上海土莊茶廠、多派人携欵進山採辦、加之本地號家相率兢買、市面頗爲熱閙、現聞已議决開秤、每担扯價五十六元、惟現時趨勢買方人氣旺盛、行情或須看漲云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　加税前浙銷特暢</h3>
<p>▲本廠棉布　各貨市面逐步回落、細粗布亦在不振之列、此係客銷不動、現貨增多、加以四月底將届、執貨者俱謀出脱、故昨細布小去有二分半之譜、粗布亦跌多漲少、細斜廣東汕頭等帮一致停頓、惟浙路因加捐之故、復成交五百餘件、温台寗波杭州等埠、紛紛動辦、尤以粗布爲大宗、十四磅喂馬·十六磅五鶴·十三磅雙廬·運去有二百餘件、細布細斜亦頗不少、其有各帮均少興奮之象、</p>
<p>▲東西疋頭　昨市異常紊亂、實銷亦祇浙路活動、東貨之文明色汀續跌二厘半、花布小五分、冲深色售四兩零五分、白地四兩至三兩九錢半、元洋紗頻跌後昨現貨忽缺、以致復漲、點秋香午後又開八兩四錢、唐太宗於八兩二錢半售罄、浙路各帮成交一百餘件、中柄花絨連日定貨交易甚活、同業中做下有一千餘件、價多數係一錢七分七厘半、花直貢呢細嗶嘰定價超出現貨甚巨、故無多定下、西貨秃藍灰素府綢最俏、豐裕一本萬利開五錢七分半、大富貴六錢、較之什色俱昂二厘半、亦以杭帮辦去爲多云、</p>
<h3>粮市　粗砂白交易更寂</h3>
<p>▲因磨細砂白出口被罰</p>
<p>昨日糖市產區電訉、古巴現糖價仍一·六五六二五、紐約期糖五月份價一·五八、比前電逐跌二分、九月份一·七一、比跌三分、十二月分一·八二、跌二分、明年三月份價一·八八、亦比跌三分、爪哇現糖價爲一○·二五、五月份期糖價一○·三七五、六月份價一○·五○、比前電亦各跌一二一、公會市塲劃盤、荷糖二十四號粗砂白成交價仍七兩二錢七分半、高貨七兩三錢、市均見疲、交易不暢、蓋大宗均以機磨後以應各處需銷、邇因某某等行由輪運往漢口各處、均被該處洋關藉詞扣留受罰、須繳納通常半税、故糖商突起恐慌、大都寗願停止機磨、徐觀將來之意、而市塲進出之寥落、因之更稀、二十號中砂白七兩○五分、交易亦靜、日糖市亦見軟、Ｚ嘜七兩七錢、ＹＴ嘜七兩六錢、ＹＰ嘜七兩七錢七分半、ＹＲＯ嘜七兩三錢、交易亦凋零、市形甚爲閒散云、</p>

<h3>一九三○年的東宮·徽·茵</h3>
<p>一九三○是美的年頭兒、女子的美的重心從頭、而胸、而至於脚部、</p>
<p>我們的東宮是在滬上各大學中最負盛名的宮主們的住所、在這個年頭而特來講這所東宮的最近發展、誰能不注意及之呢、</p>
<p>▲頽衰了的會客室　東宮的出名、泰半是由了女同學們的漂亮、因了女同學們的漂亮、而男同學每天都得趕到會客堂去、因此會客堂便成富麗堂皇、光怪陸離的了、那時東宮初建、還有一個女生指導員的位置、這位女生指導員的任務當然是類乎舍監之流遥職務、但她因爲東宮裹的女同學們都很聰明、什麽事也不須再有人指導了、她們固然自已很會去找愛人的啊、於是指導員没事可做、乃一意佈置會客室、使之成爲瑰麗絶端、可是不幸得很、指導員後來終於因爲不許女生晚上會客、因而便被全體女生驅逐了、而會客室便也因之而頽衰下來、柔軼的沙發上的彈簧鬆弛了、亭亭玉立的穿衣鏡打碎了、潔白的窗簾污穢了、···一切都衰敗了、坐在裹面的宮主又怎様可以叫她們高興呢、一句話、會客室是衰敗了、於是男女同學們便不再以之作爲談情説愛的地方、而被一班用心的女同學佔了去作課堂了、每當晚上上自修的時候、會客室中不再聽見愉快的笑聲、歡樂的柔話、而只是沉寂的空氣籠蓋着了、</p>
<p>▲新來的漂亮女同學　東宮裹本來有很多的漂亮女同學、而這學期又從别處轉來了幾位大名鼎鼎的姑娘、有的是清華｜那個水木清華的皇后、有的是金大的明星、有的是早大的交際花、眞是濟濟一宮、猗歟盛哉、於是、舊有的女同學遜色了、舊日的風度改變、甚至本來的皇后也不得不退位以讓賢、改變了、整個的東宮給這三四位姑娘改變了、清華的皇后姓宋、她有娜婀的姿態、誘人的臉龐、在洪深先生導演的西哈諾中又擔任了一個重要的角色、金大的明星姓張、她有豐腴的體格、沉重的態度、又很用功、每每在新建的圖書館中看到她的芳踨、中大的交際花姓羅、她有革命的熱誠、活潑無邪的天眞、而又富有文安的天才、火様的熱情、在滬上各大報的副刋上時常可以拜讀到她的作品｜那個滿具着豐富的情感和明顯的意識的作品、想着吧、這様的事都有過了、爲了在報紙上讀到她的作品、很多男同學寫信給她要求做朋友、甚至有將自已在什麽演講中的稿子送至東宮給她修改的人呢、</p>
<h3>印度實施孩童婚姻禁律</h3>
<p>孟買訊、印度全境禁止孩童婚姻律法、將於本年四月間實施、此後英國當局於上將不免在甘地不合作運動之外、更增多一種困難、去年九月間、立法院頒布十四歲以下孩童不准結緍之法律後、即有各地民衆羣起反對、其反對最烈者、厥爲正統的婆羅門人、聲言此項律法、將毁壤印度社會的根基、而使印度女子於未成婚前盡成爲老大之婦人、然贊成方面、則稱此項法律、純爲增高印度女子地位而定、據一九二一年統計、印度女子之年在五歳下已爲人婦或寡婦者、共計二十五萬、十歲以下者共計二百萬、十歳至一五歲之女子、則有百分之四十爲已婚者、依據一八九二年所定婚姻法、孩童未逹十二歲、不得結婚、一九二四年、該年限由立法院改爲十三歲、然婆羅門人則少有遵行者、此次禁止童年婚姻運動、起始於全印婦女大會、有許多智識階級印度婦人大聲疾呼、增高女人地位、表同情者極多、其結果乃爲去年九月之新律法、聞全印婦女大會、旣於本點獲得勝利、更將進一步努力於女子承受遺產權及廢止一夫多妻制等等事件云、</p>

<h3>Chiang to Arrive in Hankou Last Night</h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to information from the military headquarters, Chiang Kai-shek boarded the "Yongsui" warship on the morning of the 22nd, while Chen Shaokuan, Shao Lizi, and others boarded the "Chuyou" warship to travel west. They are expected to arrive in Hankou on the evening of the 23rd. All sectors are preparing a welcome. Yang Hucheng will take a plane to Hankou to meet with Chiang Kai-shek, report on the defense of Nanyang, the resolution of the enemy troops in Neixiang, and seek instructions. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Anqing) Chiang Kai-shek passed Anqing at 7 a.m. on the 23rd aboard the "Yongsui" warship without landing. The warship "Minquan" of Anhui saluted with cannon fire. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Liaoning Army Increases Defense at Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Shenyang states that Zhang Xueliang, due to Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang's deployment of heavy troops in the Tianjin-East area, ordered the commander of the 103rd Artillery Regiment, Jin Bingxun, to lead the entire regiment of 1,500 men, with fifteen large cannons, ten mountain cannons, and 50,000 rounds of ammunition, to Shanhaiguan to reinforce the defense. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Headquarters of the Third Army Corps received a telegram from Han Fuqu on the 12th stating that, according to intelligence from Tianjin and Beijing, Zhang Xueliang supports the central government. A military conference was held in Fengtian, deciding to send five divisions of troops out of Shanhaiguan to attack Tianjin and Zhaqian, and dispatch a fleet to help cut off Yan's retreat. Another three divisions will be sent out of Rehe to cut off the Beijing-Suiyuan Railway. Yan is preparing to withdraw troops. A telegram was also received from Shangguan Yunxiang stating that most of the Fengtian army has entered the pass, currently stationing two brigades in Luo and one brigade in Junliangcheng, posing a threat to Shanxi. Yan is in great panic. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Feng's Military Commanders Discuss Military Strategy in Luoyang</h3>
<p>Yan Transfers Four Divisions Under Feng's Command</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Luoyang states that Lu Zhonglin, Xu Yongchang, Yang Aiyuan, and Sun Liangcheng all attended the Luoyang military conference. Security was tight. Lu and others left Luoyang on the 24th. There is no confirmation of Feng's visit to Zhengzhou. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng has left 20,000 troops in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai, 30,000 troops to defend the western section of the Longhai Railway, 40,000 troops to go to Hubei, and 80,000 troops to go to the eastern section of the Longhai Railway. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan has transferred four divisions, totaling 80,000 men, to Yuzhong, under Feng's command. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The wireless radio of Guangxi's Huang Shaohong and Bai Chongxi has been connected with Luoyang. There is much telegram traffic between Yan and Feng. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to railway news, Feng Yuxiang has arrived in Zhengzhou and is holding meetings with various generals to discuss military strategies. Wan Xuancai and Sun Dianying's troops are still stationed in Yudong, without any changes. Feng seems to be clearing the rear first before planning to advance. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Military telegrams state (1) According to those familiar with Feng's army in Zhengzhou, Feng will move west to Xichuan, east to Zhengzhou, and south to Linru and Dengxian. Then, depending on how the Jin army on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway fares, he will decide whether to advance or not. In short, the army is plagued by lack of food and clothing, and morale is low, with no real combat capability. They have no choice but to take the opportunity to expand outwards in order to obtain food. (2) Ji Hongchang still has strong forces. However, due to Feng's discrimination, he is only appointed as a division commander, and receives no supplies, causing his subordinates to suffer from hunger. Therefore, Ji is very dissatisfied with Feng. Lu Zhonglin, in Luoyang, planned to resolve Ji's troops, but stopped due to pleas from various parties. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Yan and Feng to Meet in Person</h3>
<p>Feng Expresses Non-Involvement in Party and Government Affairs</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Evening News reports that Yan and Feng will meet in Xinxiang, with Wang Hongyi first going to Baiquan to wait. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng again sent Li Shucheng to see Yan, saying that the party and government are completely under Yan's control, and that he will not participate in any discussions, asking Yan to proceed freely. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Evening News reports that Xue Dubi was summoned by Feng to Luoyang. Before leaving, he invited Chen Gongbo and Wang Faqin to Jiyutang to listen to Shanxi opera. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important figure said that when the telegram arrives in Bingzhou indicating that Feng has arrived in Zhengzhou, Yan will immediately depart for Shijiazhuang. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Yan's Side Prepares Foreign and Financial Affairs Committees</h3>
<p>Plans to Appoint Li Sihao as Chairman of the Finance Committee</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee has not yet been determined. For the Chairman of the Finance Committee, Yan sent someone to invite Li Sihao, and also telegraphed Fu Zuoyi to visit Li nearby and seek his consent.

<h3>Lu Diping Telegraphs Resignation from All Concurrent Posts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Lu Diping, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, telegraphed the National Government, addressed to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Nanjing National Government, and Tan Yankai, President of the Executive Yuan: Since receiving the mandate to enter Jiangxi, it has been more than two years. I originally hoped to exhaust my mediocre efforts to cleanse the accumulated filth. However, turmoil has occurred repeatedly, and conquests have been frequent. The bandit suppression plan could not be implemented. The defense army's expedition caused the bandit forces to become even more rampant. Things have gone against my original wishes, and I have become increasingly confused. I have failed to relieve the central government's internal worries, and I have failed to alleviate the urgent needs of the people of Jiangxi. My aspirations have not been fulfilled in the slightest, and my faults have piled up like mountains. Flames of war continue in the suburbs, and cries of agony fill the suburbs. My heart is torn apart. I am at a loss as to what to do. I humbly believe that I am originally a soldier and do not understand politics. My talent is insufficient to adapt to changes, and my virtue is insufficient to be competent for my position. Although I have exhausted my efforts to be loyal, I cannot stop the great disaster. Furthermore, I believe that Jiangxi Province is the key to the Yangtze River, assisting the central government. Rather than delaying the future, it would be better to avoid it early and yield to the capable. I can only humbly request your permission to resign from all my concurrent posts as soon as possible, so that this idle body may still have a place to serve, and not cause further disaster to Jiangxi Province because of one person. I present this report in fear and trepidation, and await your orders with gratitude. Respectfully submitted by Lu Diping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Yang Chen. (Special telegram, 23rd)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Pacific After the Conclusion of the London Treaty</h3>
<p>The results of the London Conference did not resolve the European issues concerning France and Italy. However, there were more concrete solutions regarding Great Britain, the United States, and Japan. In essence, it is no different from forming a tripartite agreement. The London Conference was primarily initiated by Great Britain, the United States, and Japan, and their focus was on naval power in the Pacific. Therefore, it was widely believed that the sole obstacle to this conference was the rivalry between the United States and Japan, which was mainly due to the commercial rights in the Pacific. Neither side was willing to make any concessions. Unexpectedly, what was once considered the sole obstacle has now been resolved, and both sides have expressed their satisfaction. Japan's Hamaguchi expressed his utmost welcome and praise, while the United States' Stimson expressed his satisfaction in establishing naval relations with his good neighbors across the Pacific, saying that the United States has always hoped for the security and progress of the Far East and that the friendship between the two sides will continue to develop. The reason for their satisfaction lies in this. However, if you think about it, isn't the Pacific region, which is attracting attention from both countries, China? Isn't China the best arena for competition? Before the European War, China's commercial rights were monopolized by Great Britain. After the European War, the United States and Japan rose up, stimulating manufacturing and achieving rapid progress in industry and commerce. They competed to make China the destination for their goods. With the rise of competition for commercial rights, it was necessary to compete for naval power to protect their commerce. This is the origin of naval competition and battleship construction. With the endless naval competition, there were concerns about insufficient financial resources and the recurrence of war. Therefore, they had to discuss ways to limit it. Although the limitation of battleship construction has been somewhat successful, how can the desire to compete in commerce be completely eliminated? Especially in times of economic decline in various countries, they rely more on competition in commerce as a means of self-preservation. In the future, they will certainly make the Far East the place for their competition in marketing. Our country, which is currently facing a financial crisis and both public and private difficulties, what strategies will it use to resist this major pressure and seek self-preservation? I hope that our countrymen will not regard it as someone else's business and remain indifferent.</p>

<p>Part One: Signed by Five Countries</p>
<p>Part Two: Signed by Britain, France, and Italy</p>
<p>Part Three: Signed by Britain, the United States, and Japan</p>
<p>▲London Dispatch: The drafting committee of the London Conference is currently drafting a treaty proposal that combines all the achievements of the conference into a unified treaty. In terms of form and content, it is generally a treaty composed of the following three parts. Contrary to the usual practice of international conferences, which would separate into several independent treaties, this treaty is a comprehensive and composite treaty, symbolizing the sincerity of all participating countries in cooperating on disarmament. This is a feature of this treaty proposal, and its three parts are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Part One: Signed by Britain, the United States, Japan, France, and Italy: (1) "Replacement Construction of Battleships": Suspending the replacement construction of battleships until the end of 1936.

<h3>US Senate Expected to Approve</h3>
<p>But the Big Navy Faction Still Has Objections</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Washington, 22nd: President Hoover has decided to submit the naval treaty to the Senate upon its arrival. This decision is the result of today's consultation between the President and Senate leaders. According to Senate leaders, submitting the treaty now will extend the session; otherwise, the bill will be shelved until the meeting on the 12th. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Borah said today that he would try to approve the treaty during this session, which would take about two or three weeks. However, the Big Navy faction said that no action should be taken on this treaty until expert opinions have been heard. President Hoover believes that if the Senate does not approve it immediately, the treaty's effectiveness will be greatly diminished.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Issues Statement</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd: Upon receiving the news that the London Treaty had been safely signed, Prime Minister Hamaguchi issued a statement on the afternoon of the 22nd, which stated in brief: The treaty signed in London today is the result of the earnest coordination and deliberation by the plenipotentiary delegates of the Empire and other countries in a spirit of mutual concession. This treaty gives the Washington Treaty, which stipulates the suspension of battleship construction worldwide, a greater and more definite result. At the same time, this treaty also contains the suspension of auxiliary vessel construction. The naval competition among the three major naval powers, Britain, Japan, and the United States, can be prevented by this treaty. Therefore, this treaty contributes greatly to international peace and friendship. I express my full respect to the representatives of the countries participating in the London Conference for their sincerity in working together to achieve this great cause. At the same time, I also express my deep gratitude to the people of our country for uniting and assisting our plenipotentiary delegation, enabling them to complete this important mission. In addition, Prime Minister Hamaguchi and other cabinet members, recognizing the great achievements of the London Conference and the hard work of the Japanese plenipotentiaries, sent telegrams to Wakatsuki, Tanamabe, Matsudaira, Nagai, and the four plenipotentiaries and their entourage on the afternoon of the 22nd to express their gratitude.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the "Tokyo Daily News" Argument</h3>
<p>▲Dentsu, Tokyo, 23rd: Regarding the signing of the disarmament agreement, all Tokyo newspapers published editorials. The "Jiji Shimpo" said that the disarmament agreement is 69% comprehensive, between success and failure. To avoid being threatened by other countries, more political intentions are needed. The "Tokyo Asahi" said that it is regrettable that the advocacy of large cruisers failed to pass, causing flaws in the three major principles. However, considering the domestic and international situation, one cannot but be satisfied. The "Tokyo Nichinichi" praised the concessions made by Britain and the United States to Japan, believing that although defeat is not impossible, our people must not be discouraged or regretful. The "Hochi Shimbun" said that the results were achieved by overcoming various difficulties, and the efforts of our plenipotentiaries are worthy of much praise. Their consistent and unyielding attitude is especially valuable.</p>

<h3>Our Consul in America is Obstructed Upon Arrival</h3>
<p>▲Associated Press, San Pedro, California, 22nd: When a Chinese consul arrived here today aboard the Japanese Yusen Kaisha's Chichibu Maru, immigration officials said that the passport he carried was not in the proper format and asked him to go to the immigration office to correct it. The consul refused, saying that he was a representative of a national government and could not go to the prison-like immigration office. He also declared that he was born in Hawaii and had the right to be an American citizen. The consul is still staying on the ship. Later, the immigration inspector explained that, in his personal opinion, the consul was indeed an American citizen and that the passport he carried was not in any way irregular. The reason he was asked to go to the office was to clarify whether he was an American citizen returning home or a representative of China, but he consistently refused to go. It is reported that the officials of the bureau intend to talk with the consul face-to-face today. Continued dispatch: Tonight, according to immigration officials, the case has been transferred to the State Department in Washington for review. The consul remains temporarily detained here.</p>
<h3>The Great Calamity at the Ohio Prison</h3>
<p>Three Hundred and Seven People Burned to Death</p>
<p>The Warden Suspended from Duty for Investigation</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Columbus, Ohio, 20th: Yesterday's major fire at the Ohio State Penitentiary resulted in the burning to death of 307 prisoners, according to a post-fire count. It started when a prisoner, known for his pranks, shouted a fire alarm. Others, familiar with his tricks, responded with laughter. Unexpectedly, flames erupted in all directions, spreading like wildfire. The warden, fearing that the prisoners would take the opportunity to escape, placed machine guns at key points to control them. Guards outside the prison also aimed their guns at the prisoners. After much chaos, it was discovered that the locks of several prison doors were closed, trapping the prisoners like fish in a cauldron. The warden and other prisoners then tried to rescue those who were frantically shouting for help. However, the doors in the east corner, which were opened and closed by electricity, could not be opened because the power was cut off at the time. Soon after, the power was restored, and the doors were opened, but many of the prisoners had already been burned to death or suffocated by smoke. One warden has already been suspended from duty pending investigation.</p>

<h3>The Central Political Council Resolves That Resolutions Will Not Be Published Hereafter</h3>
<p>▲The same applies to all subordinate groups</p>
<p>Today (the 23rd), the Central Political Council held its 224th meeting to discuss whether the resolutions of the Political Council should be published. The commissioners all believed that although the Political Council is the highest political guidance agency in the center, it does not directly face the outside world. All meeting resolutions must be submitted to the National Government for execution. Before execution, there is no need to publish the resolutions in advance. As for the subordinate groups and the People's Food Committee, their resolutions must be sent to the Political Council for final decision and should not be published in advance. Therefore, it was resolved that hereafter, the resolutions of the Political Council and its subordinate agencies will not be published, except for special matters that have been resolved by the Council to be published.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Orders the Guangdong Provincial Government to Prevent Japanese Ships from Fishing</h3>
<p>In order to stop Japanese fishing boats from entering our territorial waters to fish, the Executive Yuan specially instructed the Guangdong Provincial Government: "According to the Navy Department's report, the Yang telegram from the Coastal Defense Office under the jurisdiction of the Department stated: 'According to the Huang Taichang Song telegram from Dongsha, at 4:00 PM today, a Japanese fishing boat was found about two nautical miles west of the island. A steamship was sent to investigate and reported that the ship's name was Maru, coming from Taiwan.' When asked about their intentions, their answers were ambiguous, roughly indicating that they came to steal fish. They then left. Since Dongsha's maritime production rights are under the jurisdiction of the Guangdong Provincial Government, it is appropriate to strictly prohibit foreigners from entering our territorial waters to fish. Moreover, Japanese fishing boats entering territorial waters to fish is a common occurrence. The matter concerns Guangdong's fisheries jurisdiction and should be reported accordingly. It is proposed to request the Executive Yuan to instruct the Guangdong Provincial Government to instruct its subordinates to pay attention to prevention in order to protect fisheries and emphasize maritime rights.' Accordingly, it should be followed. In addition to the instructions, the provincial government should immediately comply."</p>
<h3>The Negotiation Process of Recovering Weihaiwei</h3>
<p>▲Exclusive Treaty: 20 Articles, Agreement: 14 Articles</p>
<p>▲All Buildings Returned Free of Charge</p>
<p>After the Exclusive Treaty and Agreement on the Recovery of Weihaiwei were formally signed by the Chinese and British plenipotentiary representatives Wang Zhengting and Lampson on the evening of the 18th, the British Ambassador immediately telegraphed the British government for instructions the next morning. There has been no reply so far. Regarding the content of the Exclusive Treaty and Agreement, it must wait until the British Ambassador receives a reply and then agree on a date with Foreign Minister Wang to formally announce it simultaneously in London and Nanjing. It is expected to be announced within a few days. According to sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during the Washington Conference in 1921, the national representative Balfour expressed his intention to return the port to China, but it was still subject to various conditions, such as allowing the British Navy to go to avoid the Department, the British can participate in the municipal administration of the port, allowing the British Navy to train in the port waters, etc. Since then, through two negotiations in 1924 and 1925, the draft agreement, but all failed to get rid of the previous constraints. By this year, after Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and British Ambassador Lampson consulted back and forth, a draft agreement was signed on February 13 and submitted to the Chinese and British governments for approval. The British Ambassador still insisted on formally signing according to the draft agreement agreed upon by Gu Weijun in 1925. Our side resolutely rejected it and stated that the Chinese government had decided to recover Weihaiwei and change it into a military port. The British Ambassador had nothing to say against it. This negotiation came to an end on the 18th of this month. Although the content of the Exclusive Treaty did not fully implement our party's advocacy, it was indeed a significant improvement compared to the draft agreement negotiated in 1925. This is because this time the recovery of Weihaiwei and the lease of Liugong Island were negotiated separately. An Exclusive Treaty on the Recovery of Weihaiwei with 20 articles was signed, and an Agreement (i.e., contract) on the Lease of Liugong Island with 14 articles was signed. As for the method of recovering Weihaiwei, it was a recovery without consideration. Not only was the condition stipulated in the 1925 draft agreement that the British required participation in municipal administration completely cancelled, but the national buildings of the United Kingdom in the port, such as water lines, power lines, telephones, electric lights, land houses, and underwater buoys, were all returned to China without compensation. Other foreigners' private property will be temporarily recognized and retained. If our country decides to build a military port, it can also be recovered immediately by giving compensation. Secondly, in the ten-year agreement for the lease of Liugong Island, our side originally did not intend to sign this kind of contract. Then it was proposed to lease it for five years, but after repeated requests from the British Minister, who said that leasing it for ten years was not the intention of the British government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the firm insistence of the Navy Department, the Chinese government was asked to temporarily accommodate it. As a result, Liugong Island was still leased for ten years according to the old draft agreement of 1924. However, there are still comparative improvements, namely: (1) the right to renew the lease or not is in our hands, (2) during the lease period, if we rebuild a military port, it can be recovered immediately, and (3) it is only for the use of Central ships to avoid the summer heat, and there are restrictions by the Xia Wei, so if our country changes Weihaiwei into a military port, the port can be completely closed and foreign ships are not allowed to enter.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting also reported in detail on this case at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Commemoration Week the day before yesterday, saying in brief: Last Friday, the full text of the agreement on the recovery of the Weihaiwei leased territory was signed with the British Ambassador. After agreeing with the British Ambassador on the date of announcement, it will be announced again. I have a lot of thoughts on this. China has lost many sovereign rights. There has never been one as severe as in 1898. Weihaiwei was leased to the United Kingdom in that year. At the same time, Russia leased Lushun and Dalian, Germany leased Jiaozhou, France leased Guangzhou Bay, and Italy even wanted to lease Sanmen Bay. The danger of China being divided in that year was very serious. It can be said to be the most dangerous period for the Chinese nation and country. Examining the lease of our land by various countries, each has its own function. The function of the United Kingdom is different from that of Russia and Germany. Because Russia leased Lushun and Dalian, and Germany leased Jiaozhou, the United Kingdom had to lease Weihaiwei for its own sake to resist them. We look back on the past with great heartache. In that year, the agreement was established, stating that the term would be 25 years. Weihaiwei could only be recovered after Russia returned Lushun and Dalian. China was under great pressure, which gave rise to hatred of foreigners. The Boxer Rebellion in 1900 was caused by this. This time, the United Kingdom implemented the proposal of the Washington Conference and resolutely returned Weihaiwei, which can be said to be the beginning of our country's recovery of leased territories. Although this agreement had draft agreements in 1924 and 1925, it was not signed until today. The crux of the matter was the issue of a part of the houses on Liugong Island being lent to British sailors for summer residence for a period of ten years, but it can be extended, and the Chinese government declared that it would not be refused without reason. I think this is inappropriate and that there is no need to sign this kind of contract. It was then proposed to make it five years, but in the end it did not reach a consensus, which is a flaw. However, although the term is ten years, the right to renew the lease or not is completely in our hands, which is far from the draft agreement that was originally proposed. As for the return of Weihaiwei, that is one thing, and borrowing the houses is another thing. They cannot be confused. In this consultation, the two matters were discussed separately, and the agreement was signed for free return, including all the equipment built by the British government, such as water lines, power lines, electric lights, land houses, and underwater buoys. It is found that part of Weihaiwei is a commercial port, and part is a military port. After this agreement is signed, it not only means that sovereignty can be recovered, but also that our country has obtained a good military port. Because both parties have agreed that our country can completely change it into a military port at any time. At that time, all foreign merchants must move out. I very much hope that our navy will work hard to reorganize and increase tonnage in order to use this good military port.</p>
<h3>The Traffic Situation Between Dezhou and Jinan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The situation in northern Shandong has recently attracted much attention. Yesterday, someone returned from Tianjin and talked in detail about the situation along the way. It is said that the train from Tianjin to Nankai on the Jinpu Railway can now reach the Dianhe Cliff Station. The bridges that were damaged north of Pingyuan have been repaired and will be open to traffic within a few days. The Jin army in Dezhou Pingyuan has not advanced or retreated and is not preparing for war. It is necessary to walk sixty miles south from the Yellow River Cliff to Yucheng, and then take a car to Jinan. A part of Han Fuju's army is stationed in Yucheng, and the ground is peaceful. The Luokou Yellow River ferry is also under martial law. It is stipulated that the time for crossing the river is from 6:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM every day. Outside of this stipulated time, all ships must be moored on the south bank and cannot cross the river at will. (April 21)</p>
<h3>Measures for Adapting and Abolishing Superstitious Objects in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of measures to abolish businesses dealing in superstitious items, the Ministry of Interior Affairs had previously issued an order for the entire country to comply. The main points of these measures were to give businesses dealing in superstitious items a period of one year to switch to other legitimate occupations. Those who continued to deal in superstitious items after the deadline would be ordered to cease operations. After receiving the order, Zhejiang Province complied and implemented it for a month. However, Zhu Jiahua, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, with the aim of maintaining the people's livelihood, specially proposed in yesterday's provincial government meeting to submit a request to the central government for adapting the measures to abolish businesses dealing in superstitious items. The proposal was approved and passed. The full text of the proposal is as follows: "Having received the order from the Ministry of Interior Affairs to promulgate measures to abolish businesses dealing in superstitious items, and having instructed the various subordinate authorities to comply and make it known to the public, it has now been found that since the implementation of these measures a month ago, although the original measures stipulated a one-year period, society has been greatly alarmed. According to the original measures, all manufacturers or vendors of items such as tin foil, firecrackers, ghost money, paper money, yellow paper, talismans, written petitions, paper horses, effigies, and all kinds of funerary objects are included. It is estimated that the number of people engaged in the manufacturing and selling of these items in Zhejiang Province alone is no less than several million, and this does not include paper mill workers and paper merchants. If the whole country is taken into account, the number of people is even more numerous. It is believed that superstitious items are related to cultural progress and should be abolished. The measures set by the Ministry, starting with persuasion and allowing a one-year period, have already allowed for some leeway. However, it is not easy for people to find employment. In recent years, industry has declined, and the number of unemployed people has already been increasing. It is not easy for these several million people to find other occupations within a year. Moreover, Zhejiang Province is experiencing years of disasters, and society is empty and livelihoods are difficult, which cannot be restored in a short period of time. How can the number of families, men and women, young and old, who live by engaging in these millions of people's businesses be counted? The disasters in other provinces are even more severe than in Zhejiang, so it is even more difficult to resettle the unemployed. Previously, Chiang Kai-shek, the Chairman of the National Government, returned to Nanjing from Zhejiang and reported at the memorial week on April 7 that he had heard that the township party headquarters were not allowing the burning of paper ash. Not allowing the burning of paper ash is appropriate, and no one would encourage the burning of paper ash. However, they should know that the number of people engaged in the paper ash business is estimated to be over 500,000. If the burning of paper ash is banned, at least 500,000 people in society will become unemployed. It is easy for the government to issue an order, but if the government has not thought of relief measures before causing many people to become unemployed, can the government bear this responsibility? Otherwise, would it not just cause unrest in society? The Chairman is deeply aware of this situation and pays particular attention to the people's livelihood and social stability, striving for positive construction, so he spoke with great concern. It is believed that in abolishing this business of superstitious items, the government should first do its best to promote various industries, so that there is sufficient room for accommodation, and at the same time, enlighten the people clearly so that they can realize the situation. Then, the items should be categorized, and the local conditions should be taken into account, and gradually improved over time. If it is implemented gradually, obstacles can be avoided, and promotion will be easier. The people's livelihood, local security, and cultural progress can all be taken into consideration. It is proposed that this government separately submit a report to the Ministry of Interior Affairs, the Executive Yuan, and the National Government, requesting permission to adapt the measures, and to issue a general order to all provinces to start with publicity. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision."</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Mass Education Propaganda Week Opens</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Mass Education Propaganda Week opened yesterday. From 8:00 AM, the entire exhibition area was open to welcome the public to participate. Various propaganda materials and exquisite weekly calendars were distributed at the entrance, which was quite lively for a time. On Pingfeng Road and Fan Gong Bridge, the crowds of people, vying to see the exhibits, were endless. It is estimated that tens of thousands of men, women, old, and young attended the event. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Opening Ceremony At 2:00 PM, the opening ceremony was held in the auditorium. Those present included Ye Chucang, the chairman of the provincial government, Zhu Jianbai and Qi Xiyong, members of the provincial party headquarters, Section Chief Duan, the representative of the Education Department, and representatives from various departments, groups, and organizations, numbering several hundred people. Curator Liu presided over the meeting. First, the chairman gave a report, saying that in the past, mass education focused on literacy, such as literacy campaigns and the establishment of mass schools, etc. However, in fact, due to the lack of talent and economic resources, there were often no good results. The purpose of the Mass Education Propaganda Week is to use educational exhibits to provide the public with direct exhibitions, and to have activities that the public can appreciate and be moved by, and to improve the people's lives as the goal. This time, due to the short time, preparations were not fully made, and he hoped that everyone would criticize and correct it. Next, Ye Chucang, the chairman of the provincial government, gave a speech, saying that mass education is to educate the masses. In other words, the masses should receive the education they deserve. Now, I want to ask each person and each member of the public what their own level of education is. We know that there are many people in China who have not received education. Young people can still enroll in school to make up for it, but older people have lost the opportunity to study. The current mass education, I say, is education that saves people, because it can save many illiterate people. I say it is education that saves lives, because it can save many dying people. The establishment of the Mass Education Center is the central organization for improving the lives of the masses. The Mass Propaganda Week is to give the masses access to various kinds of knowledge, so I hope that mass education will be promoted, and I hope that everyone will take on the responsibility to work hard for mass education, to work hard for this education that saves people's lives. Next, Zhu Jianbai, a member of the provincial party headquarters, Section Chief Duan, the representative of the Education Department, and others gave speeches. After the speeches, photos were taken and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob and Injure People at Qionglong Mountain Every spring, autumn, and summer, people from all over come to the Taoist temples on Qionglong Mountain in the county to offer incense and build altars, which is very lively, and the Zushi Temple is the most prosperous. Jiang Baohe, the abbot of the temple, is a well-known gambler. Every incense season, he sets up gambling tables, and even those who offer incense return home penniless. During this spring incense season, Huang Yun-shen, the county magistrate of Wu County, specifically ordered it to be banned. However, the abbots of the various temples on the mountain disobeyed secretly, and still openly opened their doors. The Zushi Temple was no less prosperous than in previous years. A junior apprentice of Jiang's had also indulged in gambling and prostitution. Last year, he borrowed 500 yuan at high interest from someone who lent money at Shanren Bridge. To date, the principal and interest have reached more than 3,000 yuan. When the lender went to the temple to ask for it, Jiang dismissed his apprentice. The night before last (the 23rd), a Mr. Pan (or Lao Pan), who had served as a guard at Shanren Bridge, told the lender that he could guarantee to get it back. The lender then entrusted Lao Pan. Pan then summoned four hooligans at 8:30 PM, took a gas gun and a pistol, and went straight to the temple. At that time, Jiang was collecting incense money from pilgrims, 3.2 yuan per share, with a total of more than 90 shares, collecting about 300 yuan. When Pan arrived, he pulled out a gas gun and threatened Jiang. Some pilgrims nearby said that the gun was fake and that they should quickly catch the five people. Unexpectedly, another thug pulled out a pistol and opened fire, hitting a pilgrim in the leg. Then, a temple worker named A-Gou resisted and was also hit by a bullet, which entered from the chest and exited from the back. A total of one temple worker and three pilgrims were injured at the time. Pan and the others went straight to Jiang's accounting room and robbed it, taking away three to four hundred yuan. A female pilgrim from the Dragon King Temple had her gold earrings snatched by the bandits. Later, Hua, the abbot of the Dragon King Temple, compensated her with 12 silver dollars. Afterwards, Jiang ordered someone to report to the Third Sub-station of the Shanren Bridge Public Security Bureau, which was forwarded to Lu Jie, the director of the Fourth Sub-bureau of the Mudu County Public Security Bureau, who led police officers to search for the robbers together with the security group of the town and the water police of the Seventh Water Police Team. It is said that Lao Shen and someone else both have wives and families and live in Shanren Bridge, and are familiar with the various Taoist rooms up and down the mountain, so it is not difficult to crack the case. As of yesterday morning (the 23rd) at around 7:00 AM, the Hengtang Police Station saw a person looking flustered and immediately detained him. According to the confession, his name is Qin Yongxiao (24 years old, from Teng County, Shandong) and there were no stolen goods. He was then escorted to the Fourth Sub-bureau of Mudu and transferred to the city for verification.</p>
<p>Bandits from Lake Tai Arrive at Da Yao Again On the 6th of this month, 200 bandits arrived in Da Yao, Chefang Township, in the county. After being defeated by the anti-bandit military police, more than ten bandit boats suddenly arrived again the day before yesterday (the 22nd), with about one hundred bandits. After receiving the report, Gong, the district chief of the Third District of the Water Public Security Bureau, immediately ordered Xu Boying, the captain of the Eleventh Team, to lead patrol boats to fight against the bandits, together with the garrison. Captain Xu set off yesterday (the 23rd) after receiving the order.</p>
<p>Overcrowding of Detainees at the Third Sub-prison Shao Runfen, the warden of the Third Sub-prison and detention center in Siqian Street, Jiangsu, said that the original quota for detainees in the prison was 500, but now there are about 1,300 detainees, more than double the quota, making it difficult to manage. In addition, the weather is getting hotter, and detainees are prone to epidemics. Therefore, he visited Lin, the president of the High Court, yesterday to ask for instructions on how to alleviate the situation. After receiving the report, President Lin instructed Warden Shao to wait for the report to be submitted to the ministry for review before considering ways to alleviate the situation, or to find a place to build a sub-prison.</p>

<p>Girl Scalded to Death by Soybean Milk The seven-year-old girl of the Wang Xu family, a neighbor in the west of Anting Town, was playing in the soybean curd shop of her neighbor, Gao, at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 22nd). She climbed to a high place and jumped, accidentally falling into the soybean milk vat. The milk had just been poured into the vat after being boiled in the pot, and the temperature was very high. When she fell, her body went headfirst into the pot, and her whole body except her feet was covered in blisters. She was immediately treated by a doctor, but it was ineffective, and she died screaming in the evening.</p>
<p>Ancient Coin Causes Trouble Gu Shisheng's son, Senquan, a 12-year-old farmer from Yujia Village, Nanshi, Anting Town, in the county, saw a candy stall parked in front of the door yesterday afternoon (the 22nd). He secretly took some ancient coins from his father's collection to buy food. Gu found out that there was a "Dragon and Phoenix Zhengde" coin (name of an ancient coin) among them, which was extremely valuable. He immediately asked the candy vendor to return it, but the vendor was also a boy from Jiangbei in his teens and did not know anything. When Senquan was buying candy, he was seen by someone named Jia, who exchanged it for five copper coins. There was no way to get it back. Gu was very angry and wanted to slap him. The boy abandoned the stall and ran away madly, falling into the river from a decayed bridge. Gu knew that he had caused trouble and stopped to call for help. The boy's parents, who were mooring their boat nearby, heard the sound and rushed to see their son. They tried their best to pull him up, but he had drunk a lot of water and only had a breath left. After inquiring about the situation, they brought the drowning boy into Gu's house and cried non-stop. Then, neighbors performed surgery to make him vomit water, and there was a gradual hope of recovery. The dispute has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Reaction to the Relocation of Loshe Station The citizens of Loshe Town, Wan'an City, in the county, recently heard that the Railway Bureau was planning to move the station in that place to Wumu in the west due to train handover issues. Yesterday, they jointly submitted a detailed report to the Ministry of Railways and the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, stating that Loshe South City is prosperous and has convenient transportation, while Wumu is a wild place and passengers are in danger. They earnestly requested that the advantages and disadvantages be weighed and the relocation of the station be abandoned. They also requested that if it was due to train handover issues, the cost of relocating the station should be used to re-pave the Loshe double track. It is not known whether the Ministry of Railways will abandon the previous proposal.</p>
<p>Robbery of Sailing Ships at Yeyu Pond A sailing ship from Dangko Town, Nan Yan City, in Xiyi, to Suzhou has been traveling back and forth every day, which is quite peaceful. Unexpectedly, the night before last, the sailing ship was sailing back to Dangko from Suzhou when it suddenly encountered a boat at Yeyu Pond. Eight or nine bandits jumped out of the boat, speaking in a strong northern accent, each holding pistols, flashlights, and other weapons. They jumped onto the sailing ship and searched extensively. After an hour, they sounded the alarm as a signal, carried the stolen goods, jumped back to the original boat, and escaped eastward. The shipowner and passengers were robbed of silver dollars and clothes worth about two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Suspected Accomplice Escapes After Being Arrested Yang Zhengding, the patrol team leader of the 28th detachment of the merchant group stationed in Nanqiao, recently arrested a suspected accomplice of the Communist Party, Wu Abi, in that place. He was immediately sent to the Huaiyi City Security Group for temporary detention, pending transfer to the city for interrogation. Yesterday afternoon at about 2:00 PM, unexpectedly, the prisoner took advantage of the shift change of the guards, secretly loosened the iron chain on his feet, and escaped from the back door. After being discovered, he had already disappeared without a trace. Zhu Meiji, the head of the Security Group, reported to the county government to instruct the subordinate police teams to cooperate in the arrest, and requested that he be punished according to law.</p>
<p>The County Party Rectification Committee Thoroughly Investigates the Bribery Case Shanghai's various tabloids have been publishing for the past ten days that Miao Bin, the former Director of the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, entrusted Wu Guanli, the editor-in-chief of the Xiyi Daily, with 8,000 yuan to go to Shanghai to bribe various newspapers and buy public opinion. At the same time, newspapers in Suzhou and Jiangyin also published articles discussing the matter. There was also a rumor that the Suzhou High Court had already filed a complaint. The Min Bao and Da Gong Bao of Wuxi also reprinted the articles on the 13th and 14th of this month, respectively. For a time, the news spread and attracted unusual attention. Later, prominent figures from Shanghai and Wuxi came forward to mediate, and the two newspapers have since made corrections. The Wuxi County Party Rectification Committee believes that Miao Bin is an alternate member of the Central Committee of this party. If the matter is not thoroughly investigated, how can party discipline and official integrity be upheld? The Eleventh Committee meeting decided that Wu Guanli of the Xiyi Daily should be suspended from his duties for publicly and illegally engaging in bribery. Regarding Miao Bin's part in buying public opinion, it should be submitted to the Provincial Party Rectification Committee for review by the Central Committee, and a telegram should be sent to the various counties to unanimously advocate for it. Yesterday, two copies each of the Min Bao and Da Gong Bao were submitted to the Provincial Party Rectification Committee, requesting that they be forwarded to the Central Committee for review. On the same day, a telegram was sent to the various county party headquarters, requesting that they unanimously advocate for it in order to uphold the principles.</p>
<p>The Construction Department Bans Illegal Construction Zhu Zhongyuan, a resident of Zhongzheng Road outside Guangfu Gate, has recently been building a house in that place, encroaching on the original road by one foot. According to the rules set by the Road Widening Committee of the Municipal Preparatory Office, he should take it back another two feet, a difference of three feet. The Construction Section of the Municipal Office revoked his license. Later, it was suddenly returned, and work continued as usual. The citizens of that place were outraged and jointly submitted a report to the Provincial Government's Civil Affairs Department and Construction Department, requesting that officials be sent immediately to investigate on the spot and order the demolition and return of the land according to the regulations. Yesterday, the County Government Construction Bureau and the Construction Department issued an order stating that the Municipal Office's road widening regulations had not yet been submitted to the department for approval, so it was difficult to base it on them. Zhu Zhongyuan should be ordered to return the land occupied by the original road. The County Government sent the Second Section Chief Lu Qi to investigate together with Yao Dixian, the director of the Construction Bureau, and set a deadline of one week for the demolition and return. However, Zhu Zhongyuan refused to allow it, claiming that he had a license from the Municipal Office. After Lu and others repeatedly persuaded him and informed him of the department's order, Zhu still refused. There is still no solution.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>News of Kidnapped People in Luyuan Town Regarding the case of the massive bandit robbery and kidnapping of fourteen people in Luyuan Town, the whereabouts of the kidnapped people were unknown. Until the afternoon of the 20th, Qian Quangui, the cook who was kidnapped from Sun Youming's house, and Gu Junbao, a worker from the Xiehe Fish Shop, suddenly returned, claiming to have landed at Fushan Port. When asked about the whereabouts of the other kidnapped people, they replied that Sun Yunming's mother, son, and three daughters were being held for a ransom of 60,000 yuan, and the other nine people from eight families were being held for a ransom of 20,000 yuan. Now there are warships patrolling the Xiaheisha outside Luyuan Port. The bandit ships cannot risk leaving the port, so they are moored everywhere, waiting for the ransom to be paid.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Purchase Foreign Rice The preparatory committee of the Rice Industry Association held a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 21st. More than 30 industry members attended and resolved two issues: (1) In accordance with the county magistrate's order, foreign rice should be purchased. Each industry member can voluntarily pre-order a certain amount of rice according to their ability in preparation for any local emergencies. However, this is a matter of merchants providing their own capital and is not subject to any restrictions. The attending representatives will report back to the county government. (2) Regarding the county magistrate's order to limit the price of brown rice to 13 yuan, the Rice Famine Relief Committee should petition the provincial government to issue an order to Jiangsu's 60 counties to uniformly comply with the price limit. If only Changshu County suppresses the rice price, it is feared that the source of rice from neighboring counties will be cut off, which is contrary to the purpose of rice famine relief.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Uprising of Local Bandits in the Northeast Township On the 21st, there was an uprising of local bandits in the Eryang, Jinsha, and Xiting districts of Northeast Township, Nantong, burning down houses, robbing, and injuring people.

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>The District Party Headquarters Submits a Request for the Disciplinary Committee to Pay Attention to Public Opinion: Due to the excessive hospitality shown by various committees of the County Disciplinary Committee after arriving in Cheng (Jiangyin), the District Party Headquarters noticed the preposterous statement that local bullies were using a banquet at Yiyuan Garden to resolve the Zhou case and that the yarn factory was hosting banquets for various agencies and committee members. Therefore, it convened its 82nd committee meeting to request the Disciplinary Committee to pay attention. Yesterday, it issued an instruction, which stated: "It is not surprising to hear rumors. It is common practice to make waves. Alarming statements are forbidden by law. At this time, when reactionaries are rampant and ready to make trouble, the Executive Committee not only fails to investigate the truth but also fails to report secretly to dispel rumors. Instead, it sends a blank paper to blame us, which is extremely absurd. As for strolling in the garden and chatting over drinks, it is a matter of personal freedom, which does not hinder the progress of Party affairs and is not a place for personal gain. The Zhou case is serious, and this committee has repeatedly requested the provincial authorities to stop it and has repeatedly convened various agencies and organizations to discuss the appropriate response. There is evidence to show the planned approach. As for using the yarn factory, although there was a banquet invitation, the committee members declined it. Written apologies can be verified. The Executive Committee is observing poorly, judging vaguely, and complaining without reason, based on false accusations. If this is considered public opinion, then wouldn't the reactionaries' rumors also be considered public opinion? The Disciplinary Committee is entrusted by the province with the important task of being impartial and working hard to rectify Party affairs, undeterred by unfavorable opinions. If the Executive Committee continues to use unverified facts as material for empty rhetoric, it will be reported to the province for punishment. Furthermore, the Executive Committee is ordered to report the names of the rumor-mongers promptly for investigation and punishment."</p>
<p>The Reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce Does Not Follow Procedures: The Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce, without applying for permission from the Party and government agencies, elected a preparatory committee to prepare for reorganization. After investigation by the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Rectification Committee, it was reported to the Provincial Party Headquarters Disciplinary Committee. The establishment of the Chamber of Commerce did not comply with the procedures for people's organizations, which was deemed inappropriate. The county government was ordered to stop it, and the County Disciplinary Committee sent Zhang Yuqing and others to investigate. Yesterday (the 21st), the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the county government, ordering its dissolution.</p>

Because the shop had no savings, they took all the copper coins in the bamboo tube on the counter, about 20,000 coins. After leaving, they forcibly borrowed more than ten yuan from the Tiansheng Cloth Store across the street and then fled.</p>
<p>Educational Circles' Strike for Salary Enters Sixth Day: The strike for salary by the educational circles of Jiangdu has not been resolved as of today (the 22nd). It is reported that County Magistrate Chen summoned the principals of the county's schools, Bao Moqing, Xin Zhixin (principal of the County Experimental Primary School), and Zhu Zirong (principal of the County First Primary School), to the county government for questioning. Half a month's salary will be issued immediately, but it is not known whether the schools will be able to resume classes immediately. Principal Bao agreed to relay the message and went out to convene a meeting of the faculty and staff for discussion. It is reported that some people intend to resume classes immediately according to this plan. Others insist that at least one month's salary must be issued before classes can resume. Still others insist on the previous proposal to wait until the full amount due for this semester has been determined before agreeing to resume classes. Therefore, opinions are divided, and a resolution cannot be reached.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>A Victim of Old-fashioned Marriage: Ms. Qi Xueyin of Dingzha, a high-achieving student at a Shanghai university, was betrothed to Zhong Chunlan of Songjiang through arranged marriage in childhood. However, Zhong developed bad habits and associated with bandits. Qi previously asked the original matchmaker to convey advice, urging him to reform; otherwise, she would have to terminate the engagement. But Zhong did not repent, and his family property was squandered by seventy or eighty percent. Qi raised the issue of terminating the engagement, but was blocked by her family, who thought it would be a disgrace to the family and should not be done, strongly rejecting the proposal. Qi was deeply resentful. She wrote the "Cries of a Spring Oriole Collection" in eighty chapters, totaling 150,000 words, detailing the process, each word filled with tears, unbearable to read. She committed suicide by drowning the day before yesterday, leaving a letter to her family explaining the reasons for her suicide, willing to be a victim of old-fashioned marriage. The plaintive words and the "Cries of a Spring Oriole Collection" will be published as a separate volume. Her remains will be collected today. Those who hear of it are all saddened and tearful.</p>

<p>Rampant Banditry in Shuangdun: Yesterday afternoon at 3 PM, in Shuangdun, ten miles south of Caobu, dozens of bandits armed with guns robbed Qiu Simaizi's house of over 800 silver dollars, kidnapped and killed Qiu, and sent his head back to his house. The bandits are now rampant in Shuangdun. Caobu is alarmed every night due to the deployment of district police. Many wealthy families have moved away.

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Dispatching Personnel to Supervise and Report Inventory: The land reports handled by various village and neighborhood associations in Jiaxing are now largely completed. However, most of the inventories have not been sent. Although the county magistrate has repeatedly urged them to be made, the village and neighborhood associations are slow to send them because of the lack of operating expenses and manpower. The county government has specially selected outstanding personnel from the land reporting office who are skilled in compiling general inventories to go to various village and neighborhood associations to assist in expediting the compilation of inventories. The salaries of these personnel will be paid by the county government, without increasing the burden on the village and neighborhood associations, in order to expedite the reporting of the inventories. It is required that all inventories be submitted by the end of April.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Two Fires: At the Niaoxing house by Tiaogu Bridge in the West Gate of this city, occupied by Yao Airuo and Wu Dunfu, a fire suddenly broke out at 3:20 PM today. Various fire brigades immediately rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It took an hour to extinguish. Fortunately, the walls were strong, so the neighbors outside the door were not affected. However, all the clothes and utensils of the Yao and Wu families were burned. The cause of the fire was that Wu's family was all out, leaving only a maid at home, who was careless. The maid has disappeared since then. It is reported that she was buried in the fire. As the fire there was just extinguished and the fire brigades had not yet returned to their posts, a fire broke out at Defeng Pawnshop in Diaoqiaogang outside the North Gate of this city. All fire brigades rushed to rescue, but the wind fueled the fire, making it impossible to put it out for a while. The fire burned the package building, watchtower, kitchen shed, and other buildings. Later, the fire was extinguished, and the fire brigades all returned to the city, leaving only the two teams of the pawnshop to continue to put out the fire. Unexpectedly, in less than half an hour, the fire reignited, even worse than before. Firefighters set out again to put out the fire. The fire was still not extinguished at 8:30 PM. It is reported that the interior of the pawnshop was completely burned, leaving only the counter. It is also reported that the package building of the pawnshop suddenly caught fire yesterday afternoon and was extinguished by the shop staff themselves. Therefore, the pawnshop staff took turns guarding the night, but unfortunately it was still burned down today.</p>

<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Relief for Defense Expenditure Deficit: Since the establishment of the county police force in May of the 13th year, until the handover by former County Magistrate Luo on September 18th of the 18th year, there were eight terms (Yuan, Guo, Wu, Han, Fang, Lai, Yang, Luo), totaling a deficit of over 15,200 yuan. Regarding the reasons for the deficit, on the income side, in the 13th year, it was approved to collect 1.5 jiao of silver per tael under the land tax item. Also, no collection was made under the property donation item. All parts were allocated to the county police force for incidental expenses. From the 14th to the 16th year, no collection was made under the land tax item for these three years, so the funds gradually became insufficient. On the expenditure side, at the time of the establishment of the county police force, the purchase of guns, ammunition, and the payment of demobilization allowances for the patrol team in the 17th year, and the dispatching of county defense troops and Sichuan troops in the salt famine case in the 18th year were all extra expenses. In the past, this money was diverted from the autonomous supplementary donation to make up for it. Now, the district offices and township offices are about to be established, and all need funding. Moreover, the accumulated autonomous supplementary donation has been used up by the defense expenditure. The autonomous undertakings cannot be suspended due to lack of funds. The county government previously submitted a proposal to the administrative meeting, which was resolved to collect a defense expenditure of 1 jiao per tael under the land tax item in the 19th year to compensate for the deficit.</p>
<p>Panic over Lack of Salt: Recently, it has been the peak season for vegetables and bamboo shoots.

Since the source of smuggled salt has been cut off, residents in various villages have experienced a panic over the lack of salt from the 11th to the 21st.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Dispatching Troops to Villages to Prevent Bandits: The Shaoxing County Government, on the morning of the 22nd, received an urgent phone call from Committee Member Cheng Huaiqing in Ma Anyuan, stating that over 200 bandits with guns had suddenly appeared and occupied the mountains, posing a potential danger. County Magistrate Tang immediately ordered the dispatch of police troops to suppress them. In the mountainous areas of Xia Lvyou Bridge and other places near Kezhen, bandits are also causing trouble, claiming that rice is expensive and threatening the rice shops in Kezhen. County Magistrate Tang has also ordered the Public Security Bureau to dispatch troops to four sheds and station them outside the town, and ordered the raising of funds to handle price stabilization to benefit the common people.</p>
<p>Chezihou Is Not Allowed to Set Up a Crossing Transit Trade: The establishment of a crossing transit trade in the Chezihou area would harm water conservancy. The county government sent personnel to investigate and submit a report, which was approved by the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs and announced, prohibiting the people of that area from establishing one forever. County Magistrate Tang specifically banned the currently known transit trade, ordering the filling and destruction of the location, to emphasize the provincial order and maintain water conservancy.</p>
<p>Disturbance by Refugees Mistakenly Reported as Banditry: On the 22nd, a large group of over 200 refugees suddenly arrived in Shaoxing Ma An and caused disturbances everywhere.

<h3>Meeting Situation</h3>
<p>The chairman was still Vice-Speaker Jin Zengcheng. The meeting was called to order at 9 AM with the ringing of a bell, and the ceremony was conducted as usual.</p>
<h3>Report of the Overseas Chinese Group</h3>
<p>Chairman Zheng Hongnian of the Overseas Chinese Education Group reported the results of the review (see separate article for commentary). This review report was based on the Overseas Chinese Education Plan formulated by the Central Training Institute last year and the Overseas Chinese Education Plan formulated by the Ministry of Education, with additions and deletions. When implementing this plan, attention should be paid to the following points: 1. The design committee should formulate implementation rules based on this plan. 2. The allocation of education funds should be determined by the design committee, soliciting opinions from the Overseas Chinese Education Association to formulate detailed measures. 3. The Ministry of Education should pay special attention to the selection of education specialists and inspectors. 4. The Overseas Chinese Education Association should be established as soon as possible and research a suitable location.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Overseas Chinese Education</h3>
<p>▲ Approved the review report, except for the retention of funding</p>
<p>Passed</p>
<p>Next, discussed the plan to improve and develop overseas Chinese education. After Chairman Zheng Hongnian finished his review report, he asked the members for their opinions. Wei Tingsheng said that because there was little time and many proposals today, he requested that members express their opinions simply to save time.</p>
<p>Qian He said that the Overseas Chinese Education Department of the Ministry of Education had important duties, so the Ministry of Education must be requested to implement it in the shortest time. In the third article of the original proposal, regarding expenses, the central government should allocate 500,000 yuan annually, which should be used entirely for overseas Chinese education. The sub-section on cultivating overseas Chinese teachers could be deleted, because the cost of cultivating overseas Chinese teachers could not be used within the 500,000 yuan allocated by the central government. It should be deleted, and the Ministry of Education should list a separate budget. Liu Shimu seconded the proposal.</p>
<p>Zhong Rongguang said that implementing education, the most important thing is to cultivate teachers, and the item on cultivating overseas Chinese resources must not be deleted.</p>
<p>Qian He said that he did not disapprove of cultivating overseas Chinese teachers, but the cost of cultivating overseas Chinese teachers should not be paid within the 500,000 yuan allocated by the central government.</p>
<p>Wei Tingsheng said that this article was not a major issue. It only required that the funds allocated by the central government be increased from 500,000 to 600,000, and 100,000 yuan be designated as the cost of cultivating overseas Chinese teachers, then this problem could be solved.</p>
<p>Chairman Jin Zengcheng said that the expenses in this section were allocated by the central government, so there was no need to discuss it.</p>
<p>Ou Yuanhuai said that except for the point on funding, the rest could be put to a vote, and it received a majority of seconds.</p>
<p>Zheng Hongnian said that the 500,000 yuan in this article had been included in the 19th-year budget by the central government, and the distribution should be presided over by the Ministry of Education. The Ministry of Education should also preside over how to cultivate overseas Chinese teachers.</p>
<p>The chairman put Ou Yuanhuai's proposal to a vote, and it was passed by a majority.</p>
<h3>Report of the Mongolian and Tibetan Group</h3>
<p>Chairman Ma Hetian took the stage to report that the group had held a total of five meetings, the details of which could be found in a separate article. The important points of revision were five points, which are attached below:</p>
<p>1. The Mongolian and Tibetan education administrative organs in the provinces and localities should be organized by the heads of the respective provinces, according to the various education administrations under the Provincial Department of Education, and subject to the supervision and guidance of the Department of Education.</p>
<p>2. The central government should set up a management organ for Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui students to handle the recruitment, guidance, and management and payment of expenses for students.</p>
<p>3. The two universities of Peking and Peiping should establish a Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui Literature Department or lectures within one year.</p>
<p>4. The original restrictions on Mongolian and Tibetan administrative personnel and rewards for compiling and translating Mongolian and Tibetan texts, originally limited to Mongolian and Tibetan people, should be removed uniformly.</p>
<p>5. The Hui people, such as the Xinjiang缠哈, have special circumstances in their language, customs, and culture. The various measures for Mongolian and Tibetan education should be applied separately.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Mongolian and Tibetan Education</h3>
<p>▲ Approved the review report, except for the funding</p>
<p>Next, discussed the "Implementation of the Mongolian and Tibetan Education Plan."</p>
<p>After Ma Hetian finished his report, Ku Qijun said that members should pay attention to the detailed points of revision. Also, most members may be unfamiliar with Mongolian and Tibetan education, so this plan had to be specified in detail. He asked everyone to consider the family situation and contribute opinions.</p>
<p>Wei Tingsheng said that the reason for setting up a student management agency was to protect and guide students, and its nature was similar to that of an overseas student supervision agency. It was indispensable and different from the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Department and the Mongolian and Tibetan Committee, which belonged to administrative agencies. Also, in the past, Peking did not set up special classes for Mongolian and Tibetan students, and the results were minimal. Therefore, the third point of the revised proposal was to seek learning convenience for Mongolian and Tibetan students. At the same time, domestic students can also become familiar with the Mongolian and Tibetan situation.</p>
<p>Chen Jianxiao said that the case could be put to a vote by the chairman.</p>
<p>Zheng Hongnian said that Mongolian and Tibetan education should pay attention to production.</p>
<p>Huang Tingzhong said that the word "Peiping" in the third article should be changed to "Beijing" because Peking University has a Literature Department.</p>
<p>Chen Jianxiao said that the word "Peiping" was a mistake for "Beijing," because the change of the name of Peking University might not be noticed by everyone.</p>
<p>Wu Heling said that the fifth article of the original proposal to implement general education methods should add "The original Peking Mongolian School should also be enriched at the same time."</p>
<p>Hu Yinghua proposed to put it to a vote except for the funding point, and it was passed by a majority.</p>
<p>Zhuang Zexuan proposed a break. The chairman announced a five-minute break.</p>
<h3>Report of the Education Funding Group</h3>
<p>Chairman Zheng Hongnian of the Education Funding Group took the stage to report briefly that yesterday the group members discussed in detail and divided it into (A) matters concerning various estimates, (B) the source of education funding, and (C) the principle of independence of education funding, which should be reconfirmed. The detailed text is attached below for those concerned about education funding to get a full picture.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Resolution of Education Funding</h3>
<p>▲ Funding Sources Approved</p>
<p>▲ Principles for Central Government Subsidies for Education Funds Established</p>
<p>▲ The Principle of Independence for Educators Should Be Established</p>
<p>▲ Other Overall Budget of the Entire Plan Approved</p>
<p>Next item on the agenda: "Overall Budget of the Entire Plan"</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Estimated Amounts of Various Budgets</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong proposed that the funding for the Central Education Research Institute be included in Item 1 of Table A. Meng Xiancheng's proposal was seconded and passed by a majority.</p>
<p>Gu Shusen stated that according to the Kuomintang's foreign policy platform, all of the Boxer Indemnity should be designated for education funding. Therefore, in (B) Regarding the Sources of Education Funding, Item 1 of Category B should be listed as a sub-item. This was seconded by Wei Yi and Chen Dezheng.</p>
<p>Xie Shuying reported that the British Boxer Indemnity was no longer used for education.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong stated that the central government originally designated the Boxer Indemnity for education funds but used these funds for investment, with an annual interest rate of 5%, guaranteed by the central government.</p>
<p>Zhong Rongguang stated that the sub-item according to the Guangdong official sand, is state-owned, and the fields are privately owned. If the sand fields cannot belong to the central government, what is the intention of not being able to draft it?</p>
<p>Zheng Hongnian clarified that the term "sand fields" refers to state-owned land, as managed by the sand field bureaus in Jiangsu and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Yu Ziyi suggested that the words "(referring to those not yet taxed)" could be added below the term "sand fields" to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Lu Dianyang stated that the four words "not yet taxed" cannot be added to the income. A time limit must be stipulated so that it is easier to implement after free education is completed.</p>
<p>Zhao Naifu stated that the current discussions are all minor issues. These minor issues can be discussed by the Ministry of Finance and do not need to be discussed here.</p>
<p>Zhu Jingnong stated that the sand field issue could be reserved and resolved by experts, then reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education. A minority did not pass it, and the original proposal was retained. "The income from state-owned uncultivated sand fields will be distributed with 50% going to the central government, 30% to the provinces, and 20% to the counties and cities (with 30% of the surplus from special municipalities going to the central government) for allocation."</p>
<p>Chen Zhengmo proposed that the four items of Category B be included in Category B, but it received a minority vote and did not pass.</p>
<p>Yang Xingfo proposed that the item on the sources of education funding be put to a vote. The chairman followed Yang's suggestion and put it to a vote, which passed by a majority.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the Sources of Education Funding</p>
<p>The sources of education funding are determined as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Revenue entirely used for education funding:</p>
<p>1.  Income from state-owned uncultivated sand fields: 50% to the central government, 30% to the provinces, and 20% to the counties and cities (with 30% of the surplus from special municipalities going to the central government) for allocation.</p>
<p>2.  Inheritance tax: 50% to the central government, 20% to the provinces, and 30% to the counties and cities (with 30% of the surplus from special municipalities going to the central government) for allocation.</p>
<p>3.  Slaughter tax and brokerage tax: entirely allocated to cities and counties.</p>
<p>4.  Temple property: allocated to counties and cities or local organizations according to their previous relationships.</p>
<p>5.  Education surtax on land tax: entirely allocated to counties and cities.</p>
<p>6.  Education surtax on tobacco and alcohol: 50% to the provinces and 50% to the counties and cities.</p>
<p>7.  All original local education surtaxes and levies: the income will generally be handled according to past practice, unless otherwise stipulated by laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Liu Dabai</p>
<p>(B) Revenue partially used for overall education funding:</p>
<p>1.  Boxer Indemnity and its investment income.</p>
<p>2.  Various production taxes (such as tea tax and silk tax).</p>
<p>3.  Various consumption taxes (such as banquet tax and entertainment tax).</p>
<p>4.  House tax and shop tax.</p>
<p>5.  Business tax.</p>
<p>6.  Income tax. The distribution of the above percentages will be determined separately.</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng proposed that Items 2 and 4 under the principle of determining central government subsidies for education funds should be changed to: The province should allocate 30% (special municipalities should allocate 50%) of the newly increased education tax revenue of the province and municipalities to free education and adult literacy education funds. Cities and counties should allocate 80% of the newly increased education tax revenue to free education and adult literacy education funds.</p>
<p>When the free education and adult literacy education funds in the province and special municipalities are insufficient, the central government should make up the difference. This was passed by a majority.</p>
<p>(3) The Principle of Independence of Education Funding Should Be Re-emphasized</p>
<p>Determined</p>
<p>The chairman stated that there were no objections and it was passed. The article is as follows: "Education funding should be guaranteed its independence. This is the teaching of the Prime Minister and needs no further elaboration. According to the principle of the independence of education funding, a special accounting system should be adopted. Once local tax revenue designated for education funding is determined, it cannot be diverted for other purposes. Once central tax revenue designated for education funding is determined, it also cannot be diverted for other purposes. Only in this way can the entire education plan be implemented. Only in this way can China's education cause have hope for development."</p>
<p>Ou Yuanhuai proposed that in the estimated budget for higher education, the subsidies for private universities and specialized schools should be 300,000 yuan from the first to the fifth year and changed to 1 million yuan from the sixth year onwards because there are many private schools that have been established and the allocation is insufficient based on actual needs. This was seconded by Sun Shuding, but it did not pass by a minority vote.</p>
<p>The chairman stated that if there were no objections to this proposal, it would be passed.</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng suggested that the closing ceremony in the afternoon could be delayed by half an hour to discuss temporary motions and the content of the declaration, which was agreed to by everyone. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Temporary Motions</h3>
<p>Before 12:00 noon, members arrived one after another to participate in the closing ceremony, and their spirits were quite good. At 2:15, the meeting was adjourned. Chairman Jin Zenceng reported that there were a total of seven motions. Due to time constraints, there were two solutions: (1) Six motions would not be discussed and would be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review. (2) Each motion would be voted on without discussion. Wei Tingsheng stated that the second method had drawbacks and should not be adopted. Zhang Mojun advocated using the second method because the members had already read the motions, so they could be discussed as much as possible. Wei Tingsheng also stated that the second method was absolutely unacceptable. Chen Bulei stated that if the first method was used, the chairman should read the articles once. The chairman put the first method to a vote, but it did not pass by a minority vote, and the second method was adopted.</p>
<p>Each motion was voted on without discussion.</p>
<p>(2) It is proposed that the following item be added after "Establishing Specialized Schools" in the chapter on improving higher education plans:</p>
<p>"Improving the Training Methods of Universities and Specialized Schools." Reasons: 1. "Cultivating sound character to serve the country and society" is the ultimate goal of education and its implementation plan for universities and specialized education. There must be training standards. 2. The plan to improve elementary education already has a section on training. The plan to improve secondary education has also resolved to add an item on training. This should be followed. Proposers: Zhang Mojun, Wang Maozu, Xu Shoushang, Zhang Zhengmo, Zhang Honglie, Zhang Hongjian, Gu Shusen, Mei Zhengyuan, Liu Zhanen, Chen Dezheng, Xie Shuying, Xie Yingzhou, Huang Jianzhong, Ou Yuanhuai, Ku Qijun, Sun Guiding, Huang Dujie, Wu Heling, Hu Shuhua, Meng Xiancheng, Liao Shicheng, Zhuang Kuizhang, Sun Zuosu, Chen Hexian, Jiang Shaomo, Zhao Naifu, Lu Yougang, Zheng Hongnian, Chen Jianxiao, Weng De, Liu Fazeng.</p>
<p>The article was read once by Secretary Zhong, and then Chairman Jin put it to a vote, which passed by a majority.</p>
<p>(1) Secretary Zhong read the temporary motion proposed by members Zhang Honglie et al., "When the plan is implemented, if there are difficulties in certain places due to special circumstances, the provincial and municipal education administrative agencies may submit a case to the Ministry of Education for flexible handling," once. The chairman put it to a vote, but it did not pass by a minority vote.</p>
<p>(3) It is proposed that we discuss how to provide relief to the current state of education in Fujian. The facts are found in the report of the Fujian representatives. Reasons for the proposal: Fujian is an important province in the south. According to the reports of the Fujian representatives, the education system is in a state of chaos. The director of the Department of Education was arrested for no reason due to political changes. For the past three or four months, the central government has not resolved the Fujian issue, and the Ministry of Education has not issued any measures for education in Fujian. Although this conference has a limited scope for discussion, the facts cannot be ignored. If we ignore such a major issue in Fujian, the colleagues believe it is a pity. How should we provide relief? A temporary motion is proposed for discussion at the conference, requesting the Ministry of Education to take measures. Please decide whether it is appropriate. Proposers: Ou Yuanhuai, Xu Shoushang, Wang Maozu, etc.</p>
<p>▲ Attached report on the current state of education in Fujian: Since Director Cheng took office, he increased education funding, reorganized primary and secondary schools, clarified the boundaries between public and private schools, and expanded education. After more than a year, the plan was gradually being realized. However, on January 6 this year, Director Cheng was also arrested due to the political upheaval in Fujian. Initially, he was detained in Yanping, and now he is detained in Youxi. He has suffered physically and mentally. On the side of the Education Department, not only is the education funding being withheld by various parties, making it impossible to carry out the matters that should be handled, but the impact is also passed on from top to bottom. It is not uncommon for education bureau chiefs and supervisors in various counties to be beaten and expelled by local people. Student unrest occurs frequently, and the deterioration of the academic atmosphere is beyond repair. The provincial government is now in a state of anarchy, so what education can be talked about? Although this National Education Conference is limited to discussing plans, what should we feel and how should we provide relief regarding the current situation in Fujian as described above? This report is specially made to solicit the opinions of the colleagues present. Fujian Representatives: Hou Hongjian, Zhuang Kuizhang.</p>
<p>After Secretary Zhong read it once, Xiong Mengfei stated that relief should be provided. Chen Jianxiao stated that the four characters "provide relief" should be changed to "provide assistance." Chen Bulei stated that the four characters "provide relief" should still be used. The chairman put it to a vote, which passed by a majority.</p>
<p>(4) Request the government to support the economic development of overseas Chinese to promote overseas Chinese education. After Secretary Zhong read it once, the chairman put it to a vote, but it did not pass by a minority vote.</p>
<p>(5) Please the Ministry of Education to quickly compile appropriate school music textbooks to correct the thinking of young people, promote their aspirations, and cultivate an optimistic spirit in life.</p>
<p>(1) Reasons: National songs are closely related to the rise and fall of a nation and the rise and fall of culture. We can see this from the lyrics and songs of various countries in the East and West throughout the ages. The music of prosperous times is majestic and resplendent, while the music of declining times is decadent and superficial. During the late Qing Dynasty, when foreign insults were frequent and national humiliation was profound, people thought of striving. Therefore, the songs used in primary and secondary schools across the country, although their tunes were mostly taken from Japan and European and American schools, and the selection was not appropriate, their meaning and wording still did not fail to promote courage and arouse national thought. Because of this, the general youth took it upon themselves to save the country, regardless of their own safety. The trend was to overthrow the Qing Dynasty and establish a republican government as a result of the Xinhai Revolution. For the past fifteen years, our party has inherited the teachings of the Prime Minister and launched a large-scale crusade against the Northern Warlords, who have harmed the country and the people for decades, and respected Jinling, the national revolution, and has come to an end. It is also because education for young people can focus on influencing temperament and reforming psychology, and in various alert and clear songs, the reason is even greater. In recent times, the academic atmosphere has been frivolous, and students are accustomed to stealing love. They lack a vigorous spirit and do not understand their responsibilities in life, which has led to a pessimistic view of life. There are reports of young people committing suicide at home and abroad almost every day. This may be due to poor economic conditions, but it is also because the biased songs and evil tunes currently popular in schools and society have penetrated people's hearts and led to this. The most absurd and popular of these songs are "Drizzling Rain," "Miserable Qiu Xiang," and "Sister, I Love You." Not only is the music decadent, but the meaning is also base, and the lyrics are sad and enough to discourage young people's aspirations, hinder the psychology of the population, affect the development of education, and hinder the progress of the nation. The spiritual impact is not small. If we do not seek a remedy as soon as possible and replace them with good and appropriate school songs, how can we reverse this decline and seek a healthy heart for construction?</p>
<p>(2) Measures: A. The Ministry of Education will solicit domestic music and literature experts, together with education experts, to create sheet music and lyrics for kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools, according to the Party and the country's education goals. The lyrics should be simple, clear, elegant, and popular, and contain the purpose of enhancing will and arousing vigor. The Ministry will review, compile, print, and distribute them, and give honorary awards or appropriate remuneration to the authors to encourage them. B. Please ask the Ministry of Education to strictly prohibit all current bad songs, such as "Poor Qiu Xiang," and order schools in all provinces to strictly ban them. Those who violate the law will be punished to revitalize the academic atmosphere and reverse the decline. Education is fortunate, and the Party and the country are fortunate. Is it appropriate? Please decide.</p>

<p>After Secretary Zhong read it once, Chairman Jin Zenceng put it to a vote, which passed by a majority.</p>
<p>(6) In the entire plan of this plan, a chapter on "Implementing Party Ideology Education" should be added before the original Chapter 1 Preliminary Plan for Implementing Compulsory Education.</p>
<p>"Reasons" (1) The revolution has not yet succeeded, and the Prime Minister's legacy has not yet penetrated the minds of the general public. We should actively implement Party Ideology Education to ensure that the people of the whole country have a correct understanding of the Party's concepts and theories and achieve a country of the Three Principles of the People. (2) Some people think that developing children is the responsibility of education, and that it is enough to develop children's minds and bodies with Party Ideology training. In fact, if Party Ideology Education is not specially planned, the implementation effect will be extremely happy. (3) Currently, there are Party Ideology courses in schools at all levels. If there is no overall Party Ideology Education facility, it is no different from reading Party stereotypes. In addition, schools at all levels have training items stipulated by this conference, but training is an implementation matter. The theoretical aspect is the goal of Party Ideology Education. If the teaching methods are not specified one by one, the training is also equivalent to a void.</p>

<p>"Measures" Please ask the Central Training Department to draft this chapter plan and submit it directly to the Central Executive Committee for review and transfer to the Central Political Conference. When reviewing this plan in the future, add a chapter to facilitate implementation. Proposers: Chen Bulei, Chen Jianbei, Xiao Jishan, Wei Que, Shi Weihuan, Chen Demei, Chen Hexian, Zhong Rongguang, Gu Shusen, Zhang Honglie, Zhang Mojun, Xu Shoushang, Weng De, Sun Zuosu, Liu Dezeng, Yang Xingfo.</p>
<p>After Secretary Zhong read it once, the chairman put it to a vote, which passed by a majority.</p>
<p>(7) Please maintain the education funding of various provinces.</p>
<p>It has been found that the education funding of various provinces and cities has been requisitioned by local military organizations for military expenses, and the school land and industries of local education funding in various counties have also been arbitrarily requisitioned by local military officers or paid for several years in one year, resulting in the bankruptcy of education funding. This matter is related to the future of education and has a great impact. The Ministry of Education should request the National Government to strictly order the military officers of various provinces to ensure that school funds, no matter how urgent military expenses are, must not be used or pre-collected to maintain education and ensure its protection. Is it appropriate? A temporary motion is specially proposed for discussion and resolution at the conference. Proposers: Ceng Guangming, Zhang Honglie, Huang Shiheng, Li Quanshi, Yu Qingtang, Jiang Ji, Song Binggong, Sun Shire, Zhang Hongjian, Sun Huiqing, Zheng Hongnian, Liu Hongzeng, Wei Que, Chen Rongjing, Xu Shouzhi, Chen Bulei, Zhong Rongguang, Sun Zuosu, Feng Bingkui, Tang Maoru, Qiu Zhenzhong, Liu Shimu, Huang Dushu, Wang Maozu, Mei Zhengyuan, Chen Dezheng.</p>
<p>After Zhong Heshu read it once, the chairman put it to a vote, which passed by a majority.</p>
<h3>Discussion on the Conference Declaration</h3>
<p>Zhang Mojun stated that the speaker had no objection to this declaration, but subheadings should be added to make it eye-catching. The chairman put it to a vote, and with no objections from the audience, it was passed. Zhu Jingnong stated that in terms of wording, in addition to the five members, Dai Jitao, Xu Jifu, and Zhang Mojun should be added. Chen Bulei stated that Zhu Jingnong should be added again. Dai Jitao stated that it would be better to have the original five members revise it. The chairman then announced that the original five members would still revise it.</p>
<h3>Grand Assembly Declaration</h3>
<p>▲The Direction of the Current Session's Efforts for the Next Twenty Years</p>
<p>▲The Main Spirit and Focus of the Approved Plans</p>
<p>▲The Entire Realization of the Plans Must Come from Hard Work and Overcoming Difficulties</p>
<p>▲Guiding Students in the Future Should Adopt a Proactive and Responsible Attitude</p>
<p>Chen Dezheng, Director of the Shanghai Special City Education Bureau, read the revised and approved Declaration of the Second National Education Conference, as follows:</p>
<p>Since the First National Education Conference established the Three Principles of the People as the guiding principle for education, all of our education has had a consistent direction. With the completion of the Northern Expedition and the commencement of political tutelage, everyone, on the one hand, was excited and inspired by a new opportunity for renewal and revitalization; on the other hand, they deeply recognized that education, which is fundamentally related to national culture, had to adapt to this new opportunity and accelerate its advancement. The Third National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang has already determined the purpose of education and its implementation guidelines for the Republic of China, and the Second Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee also resolved to convene the Second National Education Conference in the spring of the 19th year and stipulated that before the conference is convened, the Ministry of Education should organize an Education Plan Compilation Committee to create a plan for implementing the rectification and development of national education. From this, we can clearly see that this conference is in line with the work of political tutelage and national construction and should be consistent with the steps of political tutelage and national construction. What needs to be discussed at the conference are not broad guidelines and principles, but implementation plans that are phased and itemized. In other words, it is not only discussing how to do it but studying how to do it effectively. This is the nature of the Second National Education Conference and the reason for its convocation. Now, we have followed the Central Executive Committee's resolutions and held a nine-day conference in the capital from April 15th to 23rd. One hundred and six members attended the conference and thoroughly discussed and resolved the plan to improve national education, which was carefully formulated by experts hired by the Ministry of Education, totaling ten chapters. The implementation of Party doctrine education has also been submitted to the Central Executive Committee for review and is planned to be added at the beginning of the entire plan. In addition, several important cases have been resolved, all of which are directly or indirectly related to the plan. The results of this conference, after being approved by the Central Executive Committee, can serve as the direction for our concerted efforts for the next twenty years. Now that the conference has ended, we respectfully present a general statement of the spirit of the plan and the conditions that this conference believes are necessary for its implementation to our compatriots across the country, along with an earnest prayer.</p>
<p>The plan of this conference, although divided into ten chapters, is a whole when combined. The plan's compilation is a comprehensive plan for national education, striving to correct the ills of disparate efforts. Therefore, each chapter and section is completely interconnected, and the spirit is consistent throughout. When we resolved the entire plan, we paid special attention to two points: first, basing it on factual needs and determining the timing and steps; second, striving to realize the doctrine based on the purpose of education. Regarding the first point, the spirit of the main proposal is to determine priorities and urgency based on current and future needs. Especially within the six-year period of political tutelage, we deeply feel that the more than 80% of the illiterate people across the country and the majority of children who do not have access to education are obstacles to the promotion of political tutelage and national construction, which are also major obstacles to the advancement of national culture. Therefore, during the six-year period of political tutelage, we mainly promote compulsory education and adult literacy education as much as possible, while we mainly rectify and enrich secondary education and higher education, first seeking to improve quality and not rushing to increase quantity. Of course, in order to meet the most urgent needs, the majority of material and spiritual resources should be concentrated on compulsory education and adult literacy education, but in order to improve the level of culture, secondary education and higher education do indeed have a need for rectification and enrichment at present. Therefore, these two aspects are not contradictory but complementary. Regarding the second point, in order to seek the development of people's livelihood, we emphasize scientific experiments, cultivate productive capacity, and develop vocational skills in education at all levels and of all types. In order to seek the universality of civil rights, we emphasize civic training in social education and adult literacy education programs, and we also emphasize the development of discipline and habits of teamwork and cooperation in education at all levels of schools, in order to lay the foundation for the use of the four powers. In order to fully achieve national independence, we emphasize the spirit of national independence in social education and school education and stipulate that primary education should not be left to foreigners. Especially in order to realize nationalism and consolidate national sovereignty, we advocate using national power to support and promote overseas Chinese education and Mongolian-Tibetan education. Furthermore, in order to take into account the realization of the entire Three Principles of the People education, we must target the majority of the people. Therefore, there are phased expansion provisions for social education facilities, and a plan for promoting the phonetic literacy movement has been resolved, requesting education authorities to actively promote it.</p>
<p>The above roughly describes the main spirit and focus of the plan determined by this conference. We believe that this twenty-year plan is a minimum plan based on facts, but under the conditions of China's economic backwardness and lack of talent, implementing this plan is indeed a very difficult task. It is necessary for all educators to have a responsible awareness, for the Party and the national government to lead and supervise with all their strength, and for compatriots across the country to recognize it as a century-long plan and cooperate unanimously in order to have hope of implementing it on schedule. Therefore, we hope that educators across the country should recognize that sacrifice is our duty, that education is a cause for contributing to the country and not just a profession. Only in this way can we raise the spirit of the education community, overcome all obstacles and difficulties, and realize the entire plan through hard work and difficulties. We hope that the government can overcome any difficulties and raise the necessary funds within the budget set by this plan and implement the independence of guaranteed education funding so that the existing rectification and phased improvement are not affected in the slightest. We further hope that the government will formulate and implement measures to protect educational personnel so that the implementation of the plan does not encounter stagnation and changes due to personnel changes, and that the phenomenon of principals changing with the responsible administrative personnel and education changing with the principals will not occur again in the education community. Only in this way can there be peace of mind to be responsible for implementation, and there will be sufficient funds within the necessary limits for those who implement plans at all levels and in all stages. We also hope that compatriots across the country will recognize that the responsibility of education is not unique to those who study education. Under the current conditions in our country, education is indeed more important than any other cause. The ancients said that teaching and nurturing should be combined. Our situation is that without teaching, there will be no means of nurturing. Ordinary people may think that it is better to educate after becoming wealthy, but our national situation does not allow the cause of education to be delayed and waited for even a moment. Therefore, it is necessary for everyone in the country to take education as their own responsibility, and only then can China talk about education.</p>

<p>During this conference, the Party and national leaders and the central authorities took time out of their busy schedules to attend the conference and provide us with sincere and detailed guidance. The authorities' emphasis on education makes us very excited and inspired. On the one hand, we express our sincere acceptance of all guidance; at the same time, we further recognize that education is the foundation for building the country and promoting culture. It must not only have a plan but also a special spirit that adapts to space and time. In the past, the habits of laissez-faire and following old ways and the atmosphere of each person doing their own thing in our country's education have had a very significant impact on the country and the nation. In the future, the guidance of students' lives should undoubtedly adopt a proactive and responsible attitude and make every effort to guide and support them, rather than allowing them to develop freely without a plan or method. Under such a national environment, we can only use the spirit of charging into battle, eradicate all past malpractices, establish a rigorous and disciplined life, and cultivate a flourishing spirit of upward progress. We believe that this is the way to realize the path of saving the country and building the nation, and it is also the only way to enhance the cultural status of the country and the nation. This declaration is hereby made. (Drafting Committee: Chen Bulei, Yang Quan, Wu Jingheng, Chen Dezheng, Meng Xiancheng)</p>

<h3>Jiang Menglin's Speech</h3>
<p>This time, the Ministry of Education, under the order of the Central Executive Committee, convened the Second National Education Conference. The course of the conference and the spirit of the resolutions have been stated in the declaration. A total of 106 people attended this conference. The provinces include 21 plans in name, which were reviewed and approved by the Central Executive Committee. In fact, they were all made by national education experts who spent five or six months of effort. Therefore, thanks should be given to the experts who went to the draft plan. During the meeting, I would like to thank you for your detailed discussions, which made the plan more perfect. After the meeting, I still hope that you will give me advice from time to time so that the Ministry of Education can follow the plan when it is implemented. I would like to express my gratitude to all the representatives and experts who came from afar. I would also like to express my gratitude to the various ministries and commissions in Beijing for their convenience and contribution to this conference. The Party and national leaders gave me advice, which I am very grateful for. All the guests came to the opening and closing ceremonies, which I am also very grateful for. The news reporters have been promoting the conference, so that all sectors of the country can pay considerable attention to the conference. I would like to express my gratitude to all the news reporters. The Ministry of Railways did its best as the host, which I am very grateful for. What I want to say today is only this.</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao's Speech</h3>
<p>▲Hope to Strive for Three Points: Tall, Grand, and Solid</p>
<p>Dai Jitao's Speech: Everyone, today is the closing day of the Second National Education Conference. I would like to talk to you today about the hopes of the Education Conference and the Central Executive Committee for this conference. This conference has been prepared for a long time and discussed very carefully. Therefore, the result is very satisfactory, which is very gratifying. China's past education has been destroyed step by step, and new education has not yet been built. Over the past 20 years, the domestic education community has also made considerable efforts to build new education, but its foundation has still not been established. In the past two or three decades, China has sent more than 100,000 students to study abroad. The average annual cost is 3,000 yuan, which is already alarming. The cost is so high, and the result is only this. It has to be said that it is a failure. If we want to build a perfect building, we must have three elements: tall, grand, and solid. In the past two or three decades of educational construction, although a lot of effort has been spent, the harvest has been small, because the above three elements have not been considered in advance. In the future, educational construction should pay special attention to the three points of tall, grand, and solid, and then success can be expected. This is the first point of my feeling. The reason why education has failed in the past two or three decades is not because of the good seeds, but because of the failure to maintain the responsibility. Since the national revolution unified the country, education conferences have been held twice. I sincerely hope that after this conference, education will pay attention to the three points of tall, grand, and solid, and special efforts should be made to maintain the work of seeds. The Premier's training words for the Whampoa Military Academy said, "The Three Principles of the People are what our Party believes in. We will build the Republic of China and advance to the Great Harmony. We will give you many scholars to be the vanguard of the people, working tirelessly day and night, single-minded and consistent from beginning to end." This is actually an important expression of the Premier's educational advocacy. We should take the lessons given by the Premier as the center and strive to make progress in the above points. I firmly believe that education will make great progress in the future.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui's Speech</h3>
<p>▲Focus on Phonetic Literacy</p>
<p>▲Must Strive to Implement</p>
<p>Mr. Wu briefly said that the meeting has been held for seven or eight days, and many cases have been discussed. From now on, all levels of education will have specific measures. Among them, the most important is compulsory education. If it can be realized in the future, it will give tens of millions of children across the country book savings coupons. In my opinion, compulsory education is important, and phonetic alphabet should also be promoted urgently. We must issue a mobilization order so that all literate people in the country bear the responsibility of teaching and educating. If only literate people may not know the phonetic alphabet, so the intellectual class must first recognize the phonetic alphabet. The time spent is only a few hours. If there is any illiterate person, you can teach them the phonetic alphabet. If you teach three words a day, you can finish it in ten days. If you can work hard to promote it, you can teach twenty or thirty people in half a year, which is more than ten times more than the provisions in the adult literacy education plan that each literate person teaches two illiterates. The phonetic alphabet is viewed as a great thing, but it is not worth a penny. However, in terms of its function, it is sacred and inviolable. If it can be promoted in the future, the sales of newspapers can also be promoted. British and French newspapers sell 3 million copies a day. The Japanese Asahi Shimbun sells 600,000 to 700,000 copies a day because it is attached with letters. Chinese Shen and Xin newspapers only sell more than 100,000 copies. The difference is so great. It cannot be said that it is not the result of language barriers. If we want to expand the sales of newspapers, we must promote the phonetic alphabet. Recently, the Central Training Department plans to propose that all party members and civil servants must first recognize the phonetic alphabet. If they can work hard to implement it, the new era of Chinese characters will be seen in the country. Mr. Wu's speech lasted about 20 minutes, and the audience was quite moved.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yaxian Represents Director He's Speech</h3>
<p>▲Plan to Solicit Appropriate Teaching Materials</p>
<p>▲In order to Fundamentally Transform the Method</p>
<p>Zhou Yawei, representing the Training and Supervision Department, said, "Chairman, everyone, today our Director He is not in Nanjing. He specifically asked my brother to represent him at the meeting. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to report to you. Currently, the majority of the national army is illiterate. Therefore, the department plans to first encourage officers to become literate. However, promoting literacy is very difficult. As a result, each person can only learn two or three words a day. The reason for this is that literacy is too difficult, and there are no appropriate textbooks. This is also a reason. Now, the Training Department is planning to solicit appropriate teaching materials from simple to complex. It is expected that the solicited manuscripts may not be able to obtain complete results immediately. I sincerely hope that you will set up a fundamental transformation method on the text to facilitate the promotion of literacy. The phonetic literacy movement has been decided by the Central Executive Committee, which is an urgent task. The Training and Supervision Department has specially prepared phonetic alphabet cards to facilitate promotion. As for improving the text, I have written a small booklet for you to distribute. I hope you will correct it."</p>
<h3>Jiang Menglin's Reply</h3>
<p>Chairman Jiang said that we were greatly inspired by Mr. Dai's words. We should abide by Mr. Dai's words and actively strive for the three elements of tall, grand, and solid, which are especially important in educational construction. The world's largest building is the Sha Zi Zeng, the reason for which is that the site is large. There are too few literate people in our country, so we should actively encourage the literacy movement to enable the majority of the people to become literate and establish a large foundation. The Central Executive Committee has now formulated a phonetic literacy plan. I hope we will start with ourselves.</p>

<p>At 6 p.m. on the 23rd, all members held a farewell banquet at the Central Hotel, inviting representatives of various agencies that hosted the members of the conference and all staff members of the preparatory committee. The guests who attended included Hu Hanmin, Lin Sen, Zhang Nanxian, and Chen Dongfu, etc., and more than a hundred people attended the banquet. Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Education delivered a speech on behalf of all members, briefly stating that the members of the National Education Conference were deeply grateful for the enthusiastic welcome and banquets hosted by various agencies. Thin wine and small cups are not enough to express our gratitude. We respectfully listen to the teachings of the advanced members of the Party and the nation and the speeches of all the guests, which we should engrave on gold and stone. Now that the plan has been approved, after the Central Executive Committee approves it, we should continue to promote it consistently and continuously to answer the good intentions of all of you. Hu Zhantang delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the guests, briefly stating that you have gathered in the capital, and we are not hospitable. We are honored to be invited to the banquet, and we are willing to unanimously promote the plan after it is approved by the Central Executive Committee. We are deeply grateful. We broke up happily at about 8 p.m.</p>

<h3>Administrative Talk Held This Morning</h3>
<p>▲ There Are As Many As Eleven Items on the Agenda</p>
<p>▲ Not Finished in the Morning, To Be Continued in the Afternoon</p>
<p>On the morning of the 24th, the first National Education Conference administrative personnel talk was held at the Ministry of Education at 9:00 AM. The Education Department heads of the 21 provinces attending the National Education Conference, the Education Bureau heads of the seven special cities, or representatives of the department and bureau heads, will all attend the meeting. The Ministry of Education was represented by vice ministers, department heads, counselors, and responsible section chiefs, chaired by Jiang Menglin. There are as many as eleven items on the agenda. It is feared that the meeting will not be completed in the morning and will continue in the afternoon. The agenda of the talk is as follows: (1) Issues of educational administrative organization; (2) Issues of consolidating existing educational funding; (3) Issues of compulsory education programs; (4) Issues of implementing adult literacy education programs; (5) Issues of high school consolidation; (6) Issues of private school registration; (7) Issues of handling church schools: A.

<h3>Reading the Teacher Training Program (3) (Different)</h3>
<p>Normal schools are the only institutions for teacher training and should have definite goals and complete systems. The so-called definite goals refer to the unique training standards for normal school students, and the so-called complete system refers to independent teacher training institutions. Both are necessary conditions for specialized teacher training, without which it is not enough to cultivate their specialized interests. Setting up joint middle and normal schools not only violates these necessary conditions but also is sufficient to distract the interest in specialized teacher training. Observation and practice are the most important aspects of specialized normal school training. Let us first talk about observation. Observation is extremely important for normal school students. Understanding the actual situation of education, solving educational problems, and enhancing teaching effectiveness all come from observation. In an independent normal school, there should be a complete observation plan, with various types of observation, such as designated observation, and demonstration observation, all of which should have their methods and times specified. However, there should be guidance before observation and expenses during implementation. In normal schools in various European countries, there are definite methods, and educational authorities often provide subsidies for normal school students' observation expenses, showing how much they value observation and how much it affects the cultivation of normal school students' specialized interests. Domestic normal schools originally had the practice of graduation observation, but in recent years, it has been heard that some schools have suspended it due to funding issues, which is deeply concerning for the future of teacher training. The program should strictly stipulate the methods for observation, and educational administrators should formulate the provision of observation expenses for normal school students in the program. What do you think of this, gentlemen?</p>
<h3>Conversation with Zeng Guangming, Representative of the Sichuan Education Department</h3>
<p>▲ Military Interference in Education Cannot Be Implemented</p>
<p>▲ Striving to Improve Future Reform Plans</p>
<p>The following is a record of the conversation between Zeng Guangming, representative of the Sichuan Education Department, and the reporter yesterday:</p>
<p>Reporter asks: (1) Your province has military affairs every year. Does it have any impact on education? Zeng replies: The impact is very large. In recent years, the educational undertakings implemented by the military defense zones are as chaotic as tangled silk. For example, the principals of schools at all levels should be appointed by the chief education administrator of the province in accordance with their qualifications and knowledge, but the commanders of the defense forces each act on their own, and all the principals within their defense zones are freely appointed and dismissed. The qualifications and knowledge are not subject to investigation by the provincial education administrator, so the education authorities, although wanting to reform and innovate, cannot implement policies, which is a great obstacle to progress.</p>
<p>Q: (2) Has a provincial university been established? What is its content? A: The current public Sichuan University is the provincial university, with five colleges: the College of Engineering, the College of Agriculture, the College of Chinese Literature, the College of Foreign Literature, and the College of Law and Political Science.</p>
<p>Q: (3) How many middle schools, normal schools, and primary schools are there in the province? A: There are 134 middle schools, 44 normal schools, 14 normal training institutes, and 22,095 primary schools.</p>
<p>Q: (4) How much is the annual education budget? A: The annual provincial education budget is about 1.74 million yuan, and the education budget of each county is about 3.79 million yuan.</p>
<p>Q: (5) What are the future reform plans for education? A: The Education Department strives for the unification of educational administration, the consolidation of the academic system, the guarantee of educational funding, the improvement of educational efficiency, the popularization of social education, and the implementation of the Three Principles of the People education, etc. There are detailed plans, and education colleagues are also working hard to improve educational undertakings. All kinds of plans will surely progress day by day if they are no longer affected by military affairs. At this point, the reporter said goodbye.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Education in Nantong (Song Binggong)</h3>
<p>▲ Education Funds Still Need to Be Raised</p>
<p>▲ Schools Are Gradually Expanding</p>
<p>▲ Social Education Institutions Are Complete</p>
<p>Since Zhang Jian first founded a normal school in Nantong, Jiangsu, and established a fundamental plan for education, after thirty years of operation, various facilities have a considerable foundation. After the revolution, the administration was revitalized, and the administrative authorities actively guided, local people enthusiastically supported, and education personnel continued to work hard to increase educational funding and vigorously implement the policy of popularizing education. Educational funding has increased year by year, and educational undertakings have progressed day by day. Recently, new sources of funding have been developed to prepare for the implementation of universal education. If this plan can be fully realized, education in the entire county may be almost universal within nine years. The recent general situation is described below:</p>
<h3>A. Education Funds</h3>
<p>I. Revenue of Education Funds</p>
<p>In the ninth year of the Republic of China, the revenue of the entire county's education funds was only more than 136,800 yuan. By the tenth year, it increased to more than 198,700 yuan. By the time the general education land tax was levied in the 17th year and other revenues were consolidated, the budgeted revenue in the 18th year increased to 321,278.231 yuan, which is more than double the education funds ten years ago.</p>
<p>II. Expenditure of Education Funds</p>
<p>This year's budget for various education funds expenditures is: 18,287.8 yuan for educational administration fees, 56,530.634 yuan for general education fees, 205,852.518 yuan for compulsory education fees, 35,696.333 yuan for social education fees, and 4,910 yuan for other fees, totaling 321,278.231 yuan.</p>
<p>III. Increase and Consolidation of Education Funds</p>
<p>Although the county's education funds have reached 320,000, they are still insufficient due to the development of undertakings. For the development of the coming academic year, it is planned to collect sufficient 80% general education land tax, collect compulsory education land tax on salt farm land, investigate farmland without grain, implement the method of increasing the tax on sand field land, and improve the collection method for well land, which can raise more than 60,000 yuan in total.</p>

Except for the Popular Education Hall and the public gymnasium, which were paid for by the county, and the Women's Training Institute, which was subsidized by the county, the rest were managed by the General Affairs Office of Autonomous Undertakings. The total county social education funding was only 5,332 yuan.</p>

The newly added institutions and undertakings are described as follows:</p>
<p>(I) Regarding folk education centers: In addition to the original Nantong Municipal Folk Education Center, five folk education centers have been added in Jinsha, Pingchao, Qianan, Shigang, and Yuxi.

<h3>Educational Opinion (5) Gao Junshan</h3>
<p>▲ Discussion on the Curriculum of Folk Education</p>
<p>(I) Reason</p>
<p>(I) Although the curriculum of folk schools varies slightly in implementation in different places, it follows the general practice of ordinary schools at all levels, so there is only one type for both male and female students. However, folk education is different from ordinary school education and has some "make it and sell it" characteristics. Moreover, the students are mostly adults, so they all have their own businesses and various occupations at the same time. For the time being, let us put aside the discussion of other occupations, just consider women. The teaching materials they need must be different from those of men. Most of these women are wives and mothers, and they need to do all the housework themselves. In addition, they may also have other wage-earning jobs. The teaching materials they need most are of course infant care methods and household hygiene, etc. Even for extremely small things, such as how to wash off oil stains on clothes or how to make children have the habit of eating breakfast, it may be more important than learning the first hundred words of the thousand-character text. When we talk about the word "education," we often associate it with reading, as if education and reading are one and the same. In fact, the meaning of education is extremely broad. The purpose of this kind of text education in folk schools is mostly to give them a tool. What important position this tool should occupy in the curriculum of schools at all levels depends on the specific situation and the specific people. Sometimes, practical teaching materials are more important than tool-based teaching materials. Those women who have grown up and lost the opportunity to study and come to folk schools will have few opportunities to read a letter after learning a few words, but if they gain knowledge of infant care, they can run home after class and apply it to their children. Therefore, some parts of the teaching materials for women should be revised.</p>
<p>(II) The level of learning achievement depends on the learner's attitude at the time. If they feel an urgent need when learning, they will naturally be able to concentrate their attention and feel a strong interest. Tool-based teaching materials are often not as interesting as practical teaching materials, because the former are less likely to be applied, while the latter are not only purposeful learning but can also be applied immediately. Children have this kind of psychology, and adults are even more obvious. Therefore, the curriculum should mainly contain practical knowledge, and the teaching materials for women should be linked to their actual lives, so they cannot use the same curriculum as men.</p>
<p>(II) Method</p>
<p>(Photo by Guanghua, Nanjing)</p>
<p>Please ask folk education experts to study in detail the practical knowledge and skills needed by older women who have lost the opportunity to study, and then improve the content of the curriculum to make the teaching materials suitable for their interests and to make what they learn suitable for what they use (February 18, 1930, in North America) (End)</p>
<h3>University Education in Shandong Province He Siyuan</h3>
<p>▲ The Evolution of Universities Over the Years</p>
<p>▲ Now There is Only Qilu University</p>
<p>▲ Hoping for the Early Completion of National University of Shandong and Qingdao University</p>
<p>(I) The Late Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, Shandong spent a large sum of money to establish a higher school, purchased land outside Ganshiqiao, Xiguan, Jinan, to build a school building, which was extremely spacious. All tap water generators, etc. were single-unit equipment, and an observatory was set up. At that time, in Shandong Province, in terms of equipment and homework, it was considered to be a giant. There were three types of classes, the highest type was equivalent to the university preparatory course. Although it was known as the highest institution of learning in Shandong at the time, it was not comparable to formal university education.</p>
<p>(II) Between the First Year of the Republic of China and the Fourteenth Year</p>
<p>The provincial higher school was suspended during this period. Although several vocational schools were established with provincial funds, it was recognized that there was no ability to provide university education, so there was no plan for it. At that time, the mission schools in Shandong Province gathered students with higher levels from Weixian, Qingzhou, and other places in Jinan, purchased land in the south of the city to build extremely large school buildings, and established Qilu University. Initially, there were only theology and medicine departments. Later, literature and science departments were added. The special quality equipment was quite perfect. For a time, it was the only university in Shandong.</p>
<p>(III) Between the Fourteenth Year and the Seventeenth Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>When Gao Enhong was the superintendent of Jiaozhou, he and Song Fudian and others established the private Qingdao University in the Wannian barracks in Qingdao City (this was named by the Japanese, and the original name was Bismarck barracks by the Germans). Civil engineering, railway management, and commerce were offered. The location of the school was excellent, and the environment was beautiful. Unfortunately, it was private, and it was limited by funding and could not develop. Although this school was in Jiaozhou, it was not originally subordinate to Shandong, but when Zhang Zongchang was the governor of Shandong, Qingdao was changed to an ordinary city and the town was under the jurisdiction of the province, so the school could still be regarded as a university in Shandong Province. During Zhang Zongchang's time in Shandong, the original six vocational schools of agriculture, commerce, law, medicine, mining, and mining were merged and renamed the Provincial Shandong University. At this time, all the universities established with provincial funds were the Shandong University, which set up departments of agriculture, engineering, law, medicine, and literature. At that time, Zhu Shoupeng was the head of the Shandong Education Department, who only knew about respecting the classics and despised science, so the actual situation of each department of the Provincial Shandong University was extremely imperfect. During this period, the universities in Shandong Province were the above-mentioned three schools of Qilu University, Qingdao University, and Shandong University.</p>
<p>(IV) After the Seventeenth Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>In the seventeenth year, the National Revolutionary Army went north, Zhang's rebellion was defeated and fled, and the May 3rd Incident occurred. The Provincial Shandong University was suspended. At that time, the University Council ordered the establishment of the National Shandong University in Shandong. The old Shandong University's school property was completely taken over by the National Shandong University. From the summer of the seventeenth year to the summer of the eighteenth year, because the Jinan case had not been resolved, the old Provincial Shandong University was still temporarily kept by personnel assigned by the Shandong Education Department. The National Shandong University Preparatory Committee was unable to go to take over.</p>
<p>In May of the eighteenth year, the Shandong Provincial Government moved to Jinan, and the National Shandong University Preparatory Committee also moved from Tai'an to Jinan. In mid-June, the Shandong Provincial Government and the Education Department sent personnel to transfer the school property of the Provincial Shandong University to the National Shandong University Preparatory Committee. The committee received the property separately and began to organize it to facilitate preparations. Later, the Ministry of Education ordered that the National Shandong University be renamed the National Qingdao University, and the Preparatory Committee was also reorganized into the National Qingdao University Preparatory Committee. In addition to the school property of the old Provincial Shandong University still belonging to the National Qingdao University, the private Qingdao University in Qingdao was ordered to be closed immediately, and the school property was handed over to the National Qingdao University for use.</p>
<p>In early July, all members of the National Qingdao University Preparatory Committee held a meeting in Daqingdao to discuss and decide on a concrete plan for preparations. Due to the limited time, the upper semester of the eighteenth year could not start. The original students of the old Shandong University and the old Qingdao University were introduced to other universities to transfer to. For the National Qingdao University, it was planned to set up four colleges of literature, science, agriculture, and engineering, and to attach an agricultural experiment station and a chemical machinery dyeing and weaving factory each, in order to utilize the old equipment of the former vocational schools. An estimated budget was immediately prepared and submitted to the Ministry for approval, totaling more than 640,000 yuan in funding, plus more than 40,000 yuan in temporary expenses, excluding start-up costs. During the preparation period (from July of the eighteenth year to June of the nineteenth year), the Shandong Provincial Government assisted with 120,000 yuan in funding, the Qingdao Municipal Government assisted with more than 30,000 yuan, and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau also assisted with about 30,000 yuan. In the autumn of the eighteenth year, a preparatory class was opened, and students who met the qualifications of freshmen in the first year of university were recruited. Classes were held in the Qingdao school building, and subjects such as Chinese, foreign language, mathematics, and physics were tutored separately. Those who passed the examination in the nineteenth year were allowed to study in the first year of university. Each class has already recruited enough students for literature and science preparatory classes, and has been in class for more than one semester. In the spring of the nineteenth year, because the machinery parts in the factories in Jinan were gradually rusting, it was decided to start all factories at the same time, which has already been implemented. It is planned to formally recruit new students and establish a university in the nineteenth year. In the past, Shandong Province did not have a suitable university, and students from various schools went to universities in other provinces and cities to study, so the provincial government spent a certain amount of money each year to subsidize Shandong students in universities outside the province. In both the eighteenth and nineteenth years, the amount was 50,000 yuan each year. This method still provided very little subsidy, so 360,000 yuan (280,000 yuan for recurring expenses and 80,000 yuan for temporary expenses) was spent on the nineteenth-year provincial education budget to assist the National Qingdao University, hoping that it could be established as scheduled to avoid the loss of schooling for the young students in Shandong Province. Before the establishment of the National Qingdao University, Shandong Province only had Qilu University established by a church. The school had applied for registration last year, but it was not forwarded because the procedures were not complete and there were still some non-compliant points in the school. Later, the school experienced turmoil. Except for the medical department, the rest were almost suspended, so the National Qingdao University was even more necessary to be established as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Training Department Cracks Down on Unqualified Party Teachers in Various Schools</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday's Letter to the Education Bureau Strictly Prohibits</p>
<p>The Training Department of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters recently received a secret report stating that various schools in the city, due to the Party Headquarters and the Education Bureau's vigorous implementation of Party ideology education, are required to hire Party ideology teachers who must pass qualification examinations. While the majority of schools are implementing this in accordance with the law, there are still some who are perfunctory and careless. A small number of private schools and church schools even nominally hire Party teachers but, in reality, still replace them with unqualified teachers, acting perfunctorily and shirking responsibility. This greatly hinders the promotion of Party ideology education. The Municipal Training Department, upon receiving the report, has already dispatched personnel to investigate and consult the Education Bureau for a crackdown. Furthermore, it sent another letter to the Municipal Education Bureau yesterday, instructing inspectors to pay attention to this matter. The original letter is recorded below:</p>

<p>(2) Donating Prizes for the Games</p>
<p>The upcoming Far Eastern Games will be held in Japan. The prizes donated by our country are very abundant. It has been learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Ministry of Education of the National Government have each donated a large silver cup.</p>
<p>(3) Female Track and Field Coach Returns to Wuhan. Zhang Xinfu, the director of physical education at Wuhan University, was hired as the coach for the women's track and field events for our country's delegation after attending the National Games. The Sports Association also requested a two-month public leave on his behalf. However, Wuhan University, due to the tight curriculum, did not approve the request and urged Mr. Zhang to return to school this Saturday.</p>
<p>(4) Athlete Visits</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation attending the Far Eastern Games remained in Shanghai for training and was repeatedly led by the Sports Association to visit various places to broaden their horizons.

<p>Sato Jiro, Waseda University</p>
<p>Below, let me state directly: recently, various public and private schools in the city have generally been able to earnestly implement the authorities' stringent policies on Party affairs and administration. However, there are also many instances of schools failing to live up to the name or hiring qualified Party teachers in name only, while actually using unqualified Party ideology teachers to perform the duties, or replacing them with unqualified teachers, acting perfunctorily and shirking responsibility. This should be strictly prohibited to emphasize Party education. In addition to our department dispatching personnel to pay attention at all times, we are now sending a letter to your bureau, requesting that you pay attention to this point and strictly prohibit such practices at all times when inspecting various schools, to facilitate rectification. Sincerely.</p>

<h3>Xiong Shihui's Discussion of the Current Situation</h3>
<p>▲ The Central Government Still Hopes for Peace</p>
<p>▲ The Fifth Division Works Hard to Suppress Bandits</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, the Garrison Commander of Songhu, accompanied by his secretary Chen Zekuan, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 7:00 AM on an overnight train from Beijing. Yesterday afternoon, this newspaper's reporter interviewed him at his residence. According to him, he went to Beijing at the invitation of Chairman Chiang to report on everything. There were no special tasks.</p>
<p>▲ Reviewing the Troops He also said that Chairman Chiang's trip to Wuhan was to review the Wuhan troops and prepare all military arrangements to strictly prevent the Feng army from moving south. If Feng does not attack, Chiang will return to Beijing within ten days after the arrangements are completed.</p>
<p>▲ Xu and Beng Are Peaceful The central government's defense between Bengbu and Xuzhou is solid, and the current situation is extremely peaceful. Sun Dianying's army did once invade Bengbu, but it was surrounded and defeated and is long gone.</p>
<p>▲ Still Hope for Peace The reporter then asked about his views on the military situation in the north. Xiong said that the central government still hopes for peace and adopts a defensive stance against the northern military, without attacking. There are many cracks between Yan and Feng. The miscellaneous troops are only a temporary alliance. Even the subordinates of Yan and Feng are mostly oppressed and not willing. Therefore, internal divisions are bound to occur in the near future. The central government is waiting for changes to happen. If the matter is resolved by force at present, it will only cause suffering to our people. The result is the same.</p>
<p>▲ Thoroughly Suppress Bandits Mr. Xiong also said that the central government is now working hard on construction to enable the people to live and work in peace. I also follow this principle. The Fifth Division is thoroughly suppressing bandits. According to repeated telegrams from Hu Zuyu, the commander of bandit suppression, the bandits have been completely eradicated. Only a small number have fled to Guangde and are being pursued. Even if it is not within the jurisdiction of our Songhu headquarters, we are also duty-bound. In places like Jiangbei with many bandits, there are also Fifth Division troops assisting in the suppression. In short, the suppression of bandits must be thorough, and we will never make false claims or leave any future troubles.</p>
<p>▲ Precautions for May 1st The reporter then asked about the precautions taken by the garrison headquarters as May 1st approached. Xiong replied that the garrison headquarters has prepared strict prevention methods and will never affect public security. At most, there will only be small-group disturbances, which are insignificant.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Returns to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Met with British Minister Lampson in Beijing</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing, the representative of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, went to Beijing earlier to address the foreign ministry on the issue of Chinese directors. Yu returned to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday. Yesterday, this newspaper's reporter made a special visit. According to the interview, he met with British Minister Lampson in Beijing. Yu told him that the issue of Chinese directors was a great opportunity for Britain to show the spirit of Sino-British cooperation and hoped that he would pay attention. The purpose of the Chinese was originally to recover the concessions. Increasing the number of directors was already a concession. His attitude was very good and said that the issue could be resolved in the Western Special Meeting. As for the Chinese Association, they only knew that there were five Chinese directors attending and did not ask about anything else. The rejection by the Western Taxpayers' Association and the passage by the Special Meeting could not be changed because of this.</p>
<h3>Declaration by the Municipal Executive Committee on Foreign Interference in the Chinese Director Case</h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters issued a declaration yesterday on the issue of Chinese directors, stating that the concession area is originally our country's territory. Although foreigners currently reside there, sovereignty should not be harmed in the slightest. The board of directors of the Public Works Department allows taxpayers to participate based on the principle of equality in taxation, giving foreign residents a superior position and rights. However, at this year's annual meeting of Western taxpayers, a stubborn British lawyer named McDonnell made absurd remarks and struck down the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors by two. According to the proportion of taxation, the number of foreign directors should be eleven out of twenty seats. Even with the addition of two seats, they would only occupy five out of fourteen seats. Even an increase of four seats would still be insufficient to meet the proportional amount. Furthermore, this increase of two seats had already been agreed upon by the leading ministers. The so-called meeting of foreign taxpayers can only discuss and decide on matters concerning the foreign taxpayers themselves. How can they have the right to intervene in the issue of increasing Chinese directors? Now they openly discuss and arbitrarily reject it, putting the cart before the horse and despising the Chinese. This is not only McDonnell's absurd and reckless remarks, which mislead foreigners, but also the ambition of imperialism to occupy our country's territory for a long time without returning it. How can we, the dignified Republic of China, tolerate the unreasonable rejection of imperialists and allow our inherent sovereignty to be trampled upon? It is heard that the foreign residents are planning to convene a special meeting of foreign taxpayers to seek a supplementary decision, which is even more deceptive. We hope that all taxpayers in the Public Concession will adhere to their original intention, follow the late Premier Sun Yat-sen's will to recover the concessions, and strive tirelessly. Our association will earnestly urge the government's diplomatic authorities to implement revolutionary diplomacy and prepare to take legal and active measures to protect national sovereignty and promote national prestige. At the same time, we will earnestly lead all comrades and compatriots in the city to actively strive to protect the legitimate rights of our citizens. Furthermore, we hope that the people of the whole country will unite in solidarity and pledge to be the diplomatic support. This is the declaration of the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Immigrants to Depart Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>▲ Due to the Delay of the Guangli Ship</p>
<p>This migration of immigrants from Zhejiang Province to Guan is a precedent for opening up wasteland and colonizing borders in the southeastern provinces. Therefore, the Zhejiang Provincial Government is handling this matter very carefully. First, it sent special commissioners to Dong Province for investigation, and then continued to send commissioners to Liaoning to take care of the entry of disaster victims. The first group of people going to Guan was originally scheduled to depart yesterday. Due to the delay of the ship, it has been postponed for two days. It has now been approved to send them to Shenyang tomorrow. The various follow-up news are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>▲ The Guangli Rescue Ship is Delayed More than five hundred disaster victims who had arrived in Wenzhou had already been instructed by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to have the Guangli ship go to Wenzhou to transport them to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to depart from Wenzhou on the morning of the 22nd and arrive in Shanghai yesterday, before departing. Unexpectedly, on the 21st, the Guangli ship telegraphed that it had received a radio distress signal near the Donglanmu Island lighthouse in the Shantou area, knowing that the Japanese ship Shenjiji Maru had run aground and sunk on Xiaozhou Island, with one Japanese sailor on the island waiting for rescue. The captain of the Guangli ship, as a matter of maritime assistance, sailed to the island and rescued one Japanese sailor (it is still unknown whether most of the other sailors drowned at sea). Because the Shenjiji Maru did not go to Shanghai, the Guangli ship sailed to Xiamen again to send the Japanese ashore. It was not until yesterday that it sailed from Xiamen to Wenzhou, and it was already in the afternoon. The immigrants in Wenzhou could not wait long, so they changed ships and came to Shanghai ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>▲ Disaster Victims Arrive in Shanghai on the Haiyan Ship Due to the delay of the Guangli ship, the transfer commissioners in Wenzhou sent a telegram to Shanghai, requesting Zhou Baitong, the assistant commissioner stationed in Shanghai, to consult with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Shen Zhongyi of the business section took over and stated that because the Guangli ship was delayed due to a Japanese ship accident, it would arrive in Wenzhou forty-eight hours later, which would interfere with the transfer date. Therefore, Mr. Shen immediately telegraphed the Haiyan ship in Wenzhou, ordering the ship to carry fewer passengers and first transport more than five hundred disaster victims to Shanghai. He then notified Zhou Baitong, telling him that the ship would definitely arrive on the morning of the 25th. The batch that has already arrived in Shanghai can first board the Huayang ship today and wait for the disaster victims to arrive tomorrow morning before leaving for Yingkou.</p>
<p>▲ Reasons for the Shortfall in the First Batch The first batch of immigrants was originally scheduled to be 1,400 to 1,500 people. Now, there are only more than 800 people going to Guan. The reason for the shortfall is that Commissioner Zhang, who was sent by the Immigration Committee to Liaoning to negotiate immigration, recently sent a telegram stating that the wasteland area there is now irrigating fields, planting food, and transplanting seedlings. If too many disaster victims go, it will be too late for planting, and there will be no land to cultivate. Please reduce the number of immigrants in the first batch and send more in the second batch, so that the disaster victims will not be idle after arriving. Therefore, the number was reduced this time, and those who were left behind will be sent next time.</p>
<p>▲ Immigrants are Divided into Groups for Management Now, because the transfer of disaster victims is determined by the committee to be divided into groups and clusters when departing along the way. Generally, every five to ten disaster victims form a small group, with a group leader. Then, five or six small groups form a cluster, with one formal and one deputy cluster leader. The group leaders and cluster leaders will be selected from among the disaster victims. The group belongs to the cluster, and the cluster is subordinate to the management committee. Each disaster victim will be issued a notice to immigrants by the committee and must comply with the entry regulations.</p>
<h3>Zhao Tieqiao Reorganizes the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</h3>
<p>▲ Proceeding in Three Stages</p>
<p>▲ The First Step is Already Underway</p>
<p>The situation of the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been reported in this newspaper. The company's planned expansion plans in terms of management and operations have a profound relationship with our country's shipping rights. Here are some excerpts of what is known about the various measures:</p>
<p>▲ Steps for Reorganization The general manager of the company, Zhao Tieqiao, divided the steps for reorganizing the company's affairs into three stages. The first stage is to first determine that the company itself is state-owned. The existing commercial shares are 44,000 shares, estimated at the current market price of about 50 yuan per share, which requires the purchase of about more than 2 million yuan. The company's affiliated industries will be purchased by the company at the price at which they were originally purchased, and cash will be paid. All purchases of commercial shares can be issued with public bonds, that is, bonds exchanged for stocks, and the purchased properties (i.e., the wharves and real estate of the accumulated company, etc., which are no more than 4 million taels at the original price) can be mortgaged to obtain at least 10 million taels to repay old debts such as HSBC and Citibank, so that the economic burden can be lightened and there is room for activity.</p>
<p>▲ Adding Ships The company currently has 25 ships, totaling 37,238 tons. Among them, Jiangtian, Jiangyu, Haiyan, Guangda, Guangli, and Tunan are all over 45 years old, consuming a lot of coal and causing huge losses. They should be quickly discarded and converted into barges. The actual usable ships are only 28,000 tons, less than one-tenth of the carrying capacity of Taikoo and Jardine. What is needed now is pure cargo ships, and what needs to be added urgently are (A) five cargo ocean-going ships, each with a net tonnage of 3,500 tons, (B) two cargo river ships, each with a net tonnage of 2,000 tons, (C) two shallow-water diesel engine ships for the Sichuan River, each with 400 tons, (D) two shallow-water ships for the Haizhou line, each with 1,100 tons, (E) five tugboats and fifteen iron barges, each with 400 tons, and three automatic barges, each with 300 tons, and another 23 ordinary tug barges, each with 300 tons. The total number of ships to be added is estimated to be more than 34,000 tons, which is the minimum limit for the current development of various businesses.</p>
<p>▲ Reconstructing the Wharves The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has five wharves: South, North, Central, China, and New. Most of them have been in disrepair for years and are dilapidated. The first step in the reorganization should be to reconstruct permanent wharves and build new-style warehouses. Fortunately, all five warehouses are within the standard shoreline of the Huangpu Bureau. It is planned to upgrade the waterfront land of each warehouse and move it outward to the standard line, that is, to build a permanent wharf with cement and steel bones, so that ships can directly dock at the shore to load and unload goods, which is convenient and fast. The land on the back of the street can be sold to people to build city houses, and the price can be used to upgrade the land. The five warehouses of Central, South, North, China, and New are 5,400 feet long in total. Building a permanent wharf costs 3,000 taels per zhang, requiring 1.62 million taels. In addition, each warehouse is attached with a three-story new warehouse, with one building per foot per day. The South warehouse can build four buildings, the North warehouse can build six buildings, the China warehouse can build ten buildings, and the New warehouse can also build ten buildings. The construction cost is 85,000 taels. Once completed, it can accommodate a huge 120,000 tons of goods, and the annual warehouse rent is very considerable.</p>
<p>▲ Three-Step Plan Among the three-step plan, the first stage is currently underway to improve (1) accounting, (2) expand business, (3) precise statistics, (4) reorganize ships and warehouses, (5) compile budgets, and (6) inventory bureau assets. The plans following this first step are to plan low-interest funds, handle joint transportation of vehicles and ships, scrap old ships, add new ships, repair warehouses, build ports, build barges, supplement the equipment of each ship, open the Haizhou route, cultivate specialized talent, and request government subsidies. The third step plan is even bigger, but the implementation period is longer. The planned contents include expanding inland waterway routes, increasing the number of ocean-going ships, adding wharves overseas, establishing shipyards and docks, and requesting the government to protect the shipping industry. Among the three plans, the first and second steps will be started first. If they can be realized in a short period of time, it will also be a different color in the history of Chinese shipping.</p>
<h3>Another Japanese Warship Dispatched to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ Training Ship "Kasuga"</p>
<p>▲ Naval Exercises Along the Way</p>
<p>A telegram from the Japanese Naval Ministry to Shanghai reports that the training ship "Kasuga" has been specially dispatched, carrying a group of naval students and a team of non-commissioned officers. They departed from Sasebo and are traveling to Shanghai via the Yellow Sea, conducting various naval warfare exercises along the coast. They are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on May 3rd. The students and officers will stay in Shanghai for three days to tour the city, and will then head to southern China on the 6th, before proceeding to Taiwan.

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in order to promote hygiene in all districts, protect the health of the people, and issue instructions to each area's municipal committees on the matter, specifically setting a limit of two weeks for formulating easy-to-implement sanitation and epidemic prevention measures. The directive is excerpted below: "To Whom It May Concern: It has been investigated that hygiene matters in various districts of the city, due to insufficient funds and lack of personnel distribution, in most districts are still handled by the bureau in accordance with Article 6 of the organizational rules for municipal committee affairs offices in each district of the city, entrusting the municipal committees of each district to handle them, and in November of the 17th year, preliminary sanitation and epidemic prevention facilities were formulated and ordered to be implemented by each district. Now, in order to promote hygiene and protect the health of citizens, the following items are re-listed to instruct each member to closely observe the local situation and formulate concrete measures that are easy to implement within two weeks after the document arrives, and submit them for review and approval, and forward them to the Shanghai Special Municipality Government for inspection and instructions, and implement them accordingly. This is most important. You must comply and handle accordingly. The following are the matters for which implementation and reorganization measures should be formulated: (1) Pits and toilets are set up along rivers and near wells, and feces and sewage are easy to flow in, which is easy to breed epidemics. Also, pits and toilets should not be set up in densely populated areas where culture and transportation are flourishing, so as to avoid the spread of foul air, which may hinder hygiene. How many such pits and toilets are there in the district, where are they located, what are the names of the owners, and how to implement the demolition; (1) How many public toilets should be set up in the bustling town of a certain place in the district at least, what method is the most economical, how much will it cost, and what is the most convenient management method; (1) Stagnant water and sewage ponds are most likely to breed mosquitoes. Mosquitoes are harmful insects that transmit malaria.

If it is not easy to find medicine or midwifery, how should we try to remedy it? If a mobile clinic doctor is set up, where in the district should it be concentrated in terms of transportation and facts, and which district should the patrol route be combined with; (1) Instilling hygiene knowledge to the people is fundamentally a fundamental plan to improve the level of education, but at a time when this level is not uniform and cannot solve the urgent need, what existing system or habit should be used to instill hygiene knowledge without spending much money but can have a great effect; (1) Local special circumstances, in terms of hygiene, whether there are special obstacles, if there are special harmful things or bad habits, list them one by one, and discuss measures to ban and remedy them; (1) Whether there is any matter of using evil arts or prescription parties to confuse people and treat diseases in the district, if there are such matters, list the location, name, or temple name, and submit them for investigation and prohibition."</p>
<h3>All Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association to Open Exhibition</h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to Be Held at the Ningbo Hometown Association Starting May 2nd</p>
<p>The All Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai believes that the disaster situation in Zhejiang Province last year was extremely serious, and it is not enough to seek relief without finding ways to raise funds. It specifically discussed methods, requesting all sectors of business and academia to donate books and various commodities as much as possible, and decided to open an exhibition at the Ningbo Hometown Association from May 2nd to 8th. At the same time, 30,000 Shan Guo tickets were issued, numbered, and each ticket was sold for five yuan. Each number has a gift, and the ticket price is fully used to contribute to the relief fund. It is truly a multi-faceted good deed. It is said that the distribution of this relief fund is entirely based on the severity of the disaster situation in various places. The two prefectures of Tai and Wen will get two-fifths of the total amount, and the remaining disaster-stricken counties will also get half of it.</p>
<h3>Northern Huixian County Road of Shanghai County Accepted Yesterday</h3>
<p>The roadbed of the Shanghai North Huixian section of the Songhu County Road has been completed, and Huang Zengmu, director of the Baoshan County Construction Bureau, commissioned by the Jiangsu Construction Department, has been inspected and accepted nearby. Director Huang came to Shanghai yesterday morning to visit the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, and together with Director Wu Wenhua, took the Shanghai Minlong distance bus to Beiqiao, and then walked along the road to observe the road surface, which was very neat. After the inspection and acceptance, Directors Huang and Wu still took the bus back to Shanghai. Huang then bid farewell and returned to Bao, reporting to the Construction Department, and according to Director Wu, the road surface and bridges will be built next month as soon as the department approves the approval.</p>
<h3>County Public Security Bureau Changes Bureau to Section</h3>
<p>▲ County Government Meeting Today</p>
<p>▲ Police Salaries for January Were Paid Yesterday</p>
<p>The 37th County Government Meeting of Shanghai County was originally scheduled to be held next Monday. Because the issue of changing the County Public Security Bureau from a bureau to a section needs to be discussed in concrete terms, it has been advanced to 2:00 PM on April 24th (i.e., today). Letters have been sent to each bureau director, hoping that they will bring the reorganization guidelines and follow-up plans, or other important motions, to the meeting for study. This time, the Jiangsu Finance Department subsidized 2,000 yuan for the police salaries of the County Public Security Bureau, and instructed the County Finance Bureau to raise funds. However, the Finance Bureau wanted to deduct the 1,780 yuan that the Public Security Bureau had previously taken, but County Magistrate Leng mediated and the Finance Bureau still allocated 2,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, one wave was not settled and another wave rose. During the tenure of the former Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhu, there was also one month's arrears. Therefore, Zhu requested to issue the old arrears first. County Magistrate Leng believed that the police officers had accumulated too many debts and could not delay the food. As a result, Shen, the director, was ordered to collect the money, so the bureau has temporarily maintained the status quo by collecting and issuing one month's police salaries yesterday.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Federation to Reorganize Civil Society</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of All Roads Chamber of Commerce notified all committees: "To Whom It May Concern: The resolutions of the plenary representative meeting on April 19th were as follows: (A) Decided to reorganize the association.

All original representatives from each road are members of the preparatory committee. Correspondingly, we hereby request your members to attend the meeting at that time. The reorganization of association affairs is very urgent. Please do not give up in order to facilitate the progress. It is very urgent to pray. With best wishes, etc."</p>
<h3>Question of Concession Rickshaw Licenses</h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Council Has Agreed to Gradually Relax Restrictions</p>
<p>▲Both Sides Are Still Negotiating Methods</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs previously instructed Chen Shiguang, the head of the Shanghai Office, to consult with the Municipal Council about increasing the number of rickshaw licenses to maintain the livelihoods of ordinary people. Mr. Chen visited Edward, the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, at 3:00 PM yesterday to negotiate this matter, and there has been progress. The Municipal Council no longer insists on its previous stance but stated that it must gradually relax restrictions. Both sides are still negotiating methods.</p>
<h3>The United Association of Chinese Cigarette Factories Again Asks to Stop the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou Tobacco Public Sales System</h3>
<p>The United Association of Chinese Cigarette Factories in Shanghai previously appealed to the Tobacco Unified Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance to find a way to stop the Min Province Zhangzhou-Quanzhou Financial Consolidation Office from implementing a tobacco and alcohol monopoly, which resulted in the closure of Chinese cigarette factories. This was approved and reported in this newspaper. Now, it is learned that the association has received a telegram from the Min Association, stating that the ban was ineffective. The association was outraged upon hearing the news and urgently appealed to the Tobacco Unified Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, requesting a strict cancellation. The original letter is recorded below (titles omitted): Respectfully, regarding the case of the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou Financial Consolidation Office implementing a tobacco and alcohol monopoly, we received a reply from your office on the 15th, stating that you received our letter stating that the Fujian Zhangzhou-Quanzhou Financial Consolidation Office plans to implement a tobacco and alcohol monopoly on April 1st, and enclosed a copy of the regulations formulated by the office, requesting a ban, etc. After investigation, the tobacco monopoly fundamentally conflicts with the unified tax regulations and is inappropriate. In addition to strictly informing the Fujian Provincial Government and the Ministry of Military Affairs, and ordering the Fujian Tobacco Unified Tax Bureau to find ways to stop it separately, we hereby reply for your reference, etc. Upon approval, we immediately forwarded a telegram to the Xiamen Cigarette Merchant Association and sent letters to the member cigarette factories. We also received a telegram from the Xiamen Cigarette Merchant Association, stating, “We received the telegram. The monopoly bureau was unable to be stopped by the Fujian Tobacco Unified Tax Bureau. We urgently request another serious application to the Ministry and Office, or to earnestly request General Supervisor He to strictly telegraph Zhang’s division to cancel it. We look forward to a reply,” etc. Based on this, we investigated that the same office in Min Province, under the Party and the nation, dares to hold feudal ideas, imitate the old tricks of warlords, disregard laws and regulations, and cannot be stopped. How can it demonstrate the authority of the central government and complete the great cause of unification? Thinking of the future, it is especially heartbreaking. The business of our members has been greatly impacted, so we dare to appeal to you to review and verify the facts and quickly and strictly cancel the Zhangzhou-Quanzhou cigarette monopoly to rectify officialdom and maintain industry and commerce. It is truly in the public interest, etc.</p>
<h3>The Special Tax Bureau Returns Confiscated Parasols</h3>
<p>The case of the Business Consolidation Bureau sending a letter to the Jiangsu Special Tax Bureau regarding parasol taxes has been reported in this newspaper. Now, the bureau has agreed to release the original goods and replied to the Business Consolidation Association in a letter, the original text of which is as follows: In reply, we recently received a letter stating that according to a letter from the Shanghai Special City Parasol Industry Consolidation Committee, please return the twenty dozen parasols from the Huali Time Umbrella Factory that our group confiscated immediately, etc. Upon approval, after investigating this case, according to a report from our group’s investigators, the twenty dozen parasols transported for export by the Huali Time Umbrella Factory had no tax ticket and refused inspection, which led to the goods being detained and ordered to pay taxes. Now, we have received a letter stating that there are tax tickets from the Foreign Guang Tax Bureau and the Shanghai Tax South Section Inspection Office, which can be approved for release. We hereby reply for your reference and hope to instruct the merchant to submit the above tax ticket for inspection and retrieve the goods as soon as possible. In the future, all exported goods must be accompanied by a bill of lading and be subject to inspection to avoid misunderstandings and avoid misunderstandings. Another letter to Huali Time Umbrella Factory, with similar wording, omitted.</p>

<h3>Xu Peikun’s Observations on Japan</h3>
<p>▲Tokyo Has Been Completely Renovated</p>
<p>▲The Economic Situation is Not Good</p>
<p>▲Education is Extremely Developed</p>
<p>▲Women Use Domestic Products</p>
<p>Professor Xu Peikun of the Zhongda Business School of this city led a study group of the class of 1919 from the college to major cities in Japan at the beginning of the month to inspect the economic situation. They received warm hospitality from people from all walks of life in Japan, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Japan-China Association contacted them to visit, which was especially commendable. The group stayed in Tokyo for the longest time, so they visited the most institutions. They have now returned to Shanghai. According to Professor Xu, when the great earthquake occurred in Japan, the entire city of Tokyo suffered, with the greatest losses. However, all the current streets and houses have been completely renovated, with no traces of the great disaster. Moreover, all construction projects, whether education, railways, or other commercial and industrial undertakings, are currently being actively carried out without sparing any effort. This is enough to show the ability and spirit of the Japanese people. However, the current economic situation in the country does not seem to be very good. For example, in the past, 300 miles of railways could be added each year, but now, due to weak economic strength, only 100 miles can be added each year. Moreover, since the great earthquake, international trade has suddenly changed direction, with imports far exceeding exports. This is a concern for the people of the country, so the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has specially established a trade bureau to plan ways to make up for it. If the export association and the export compensation system have already been implemented in order. Recently, due to the lifting of the gold ban, the financial market has shown unstable phenomena. However, the authorities in the country have taken appropriate measures and should not cause major impacts. As for the development of education in the country, it is even more admirable. Regardless of men, women, old or young, regardless of class, everyone can write and read. In terms of patriotism, it cannot be compared with the people of other countries. The virtues and virtues of its women are especially admirable and admirable. No one does not use domestic products, and all their clothing is Japanese style. Compared with our country's empty talk about promoting domestic products, the difference is huge.</p>
<h3>Taihu Bandit Leader Arrested and Transferred to the Garrison Command Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Strict Interrogation by the Military Law Office Within Days</p>
<p>▲Three of the Four Gangs of Lake Bandits Have Been Eliminated</p>
<p>Taihu bandit leader Tian Zhongde fled to Shanghai due to the intense encirclement and suppression by Hu Yuzu's troops of the 13th Brigade of the 5th Division. He hid at No. 24 Dapu Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, in the French Concession. The detection team of the Songhu Garrison Command discovered this and, together with the French police detectives, arrested Tian and temporarily detained him in the French Concession Police Station. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the detection team prepared a document to extradite Tian and escort him to the Garrison Command. It was decided that the Military Law Office would conduct a strict interrogation within days and punish him according to the law. According to Xiong Shihui, the commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, speaking to this newspaper's reporter, the Taihu bandits are divided into four gangs: the Henan Gang, the Pudong Gang, the Haizhou Gang, and the Anhui Gang. The Henan Gang has the most power. The leader of the Henan Gang is Tian Zhongde, who was captured in Shanghai. Zhang Zhaohua, the bandit leader arrested in Suzhou, is the leader of the Haizhou Gang. The remaining Pudong Gang has been completely eliminated, and the Anhui Gang is scurrying around Guangde, causing disturbances, and is being pursued and suppressed. It should be pacified soon.</p>
<h3>Cheng Youren Accuses a Patrol Officer of Adultery with His Wife</h3>
<p>▲The Complaint Describes Everything Vividly</p>
<p>▲The Wife Absolutely Denies Any Misconduct</p>
<p>▲The Patrol Officer Firmly States That He Would Not Dare to Break the Law</p>
<p>▲As a Result, Both Were Found Not Guilty</p>
<p>▲The Couple's Resentment Deepens The current first district patrol officer of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Ge Yuming, is from Beiping. His residence is at No. 610 Minhou Lane, Hartung Road, on the west side of Shanghai. Next door, at No. 636, is the printing factory established by Cheng Youren, an employee of the Zhonghua Book Company. Cheng and his wife, Wei Suqin, live upstairs in the printing factory, so the Cheng and Ge families live across from each other. Cheng and Wei have been estranged since last summer, and recently their resentment has deepened, leading to mutual lawsuits.</p>
<p>▲The Adultery Case Is Heard First The case of Wei accusing Cheng of abuse and abandonment and requesting a divorce was previously opened once by the Special District Local Court. Because Cheng also filed a criminal charge against Wei Suqin and Ge Yuming for adultery and absconding, which has not yet been heard, the judge ordered the civil case to be postponed. Yesterday afternoon, Xu Jiashi, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the Special District Local Court, first heard the adultery case filed by Cheng.</p>
<p>▲Returning Home Late from a Garden Visit The plaintiff's lawyer briefly described the case, and then summoned the plaintiff, Cheng Youren, to testify that he married Wei Suqin on September 20th of the thirteenth year, and it has been five and a half years since, and they have never had children. They have been estranged since last summer. On the afternoon of May 5th of last year, I returned home at 5:30 PM and did not see Wei. She did not return until late. She said she was visiting the garden. I was very suspicious. On the afternoon of the 7th, around 3:00 or 4:00 PM, I returned home from outside and did not see Wei in the room. So I called Wei Wencheng, the elder brother of the wife, to wait until 6:30 PM, when Wei returned from outside.</p>
<p>▲Visiting Zhaofeng Garden Together Until a certain day in July, my colleague Yao Genrong and five others went to visit Zhaofeng Garden after work at dusk. They saw Wei and Ge also visiting the garden together. Later, they walked together. Yao and others followed them to a certain tram station and heard Wei and Ge discussing escaping. One of the five people, surnamed Xu, asked Wei at the time, "Who is Ge?" The wife did not answer and turned away.</p>
<p>▲The Marriage Certificate Was Reduced to Ashes On December 8th, in the afternoon, I returned home due to rain. I went upstairs and entered the room and saw Ge in my room. At that time, Ge was wearing a pistol. I did not dare to argue with him and let him leave. The next day, Wei left without saying goodbye. I don't know where she went. Until the 30th, she was accompanied back by her brother-in-law, Yao Junzhang, and admitted her mistake and wrote a letter of repentance, and asked me to publish it in the newspaper. I thought she was not sincere. She came back either to get letters between her and Ge, and items such as the marriage certificate that I married her. Later, she took it away and reduced it to ashes.</p>
<p>▲Returning and Disappearing Again On the morning of February 28th of this year, I went out to collect debts. When I returned, she had already escaped. In addition to her clothes, she also stole 70 yuan in foreign currency and 120 cents in small foreign currency. I was planning to sue her, but she had already filed a lawsuit first, damaging my reputation. She was repeatedly summoned, but Wei did not appear and was dismissed. So I filed a complaint against the two of them on the 15th of last month, etc.</p>
<p>▲Testimonies of Various Witnesses Yao Genrong and a Mr. Xu were then summoned as witnesses and questioned about what they saw in Zhaofeng Garden. The two said that Wei was wearing a pink cheongsam that day, and Ge was also wearing a serge suit. Later, they walked together to the Changbang Road tram station and heard the two discussing escaping together. Wei Wencheng and another sister, Yao Wei (the wife of Yao Junzhang), also came to court and briefly described a few words. They all said they did not know about the adultery and other matters alleged by Cheng. According to Cheng's apprentice, Lin Xingsheng, when Wei escaped, she ordered him to go out to buy pears. When he returned with the pears, Wei had escaped and the boxes were all open, etc.</p>
<p>▲The Wife Denies It Flatly When questioned, Wei Suqin flatly denied any improper behavior, saying that because she had been abused by Cheng repeatedly, especially last year, she went out for medical treatment temporarily. When she left, she handed over 500 yuan of the Jin Cheng Bank passbook and keys to Cheng. Unexpectedly, he later published it in the newspaper, wantonly slandering me. On the fifth day of the twelfth lunar month, I was accompanied back by my sister Qian. Seeing that his attitude was still the same, I took a few clothes and went out again. Since I did nothing wrong, why should I repent? Now, the statements made by Cheng and the witnesses are all fabricated. After I hired a lawyer to sue Cheng in January, my relatives and friends advised me to consider the relationship between husband and wife, so I did not appear in court during the trial, etc.</p>
<p>▲How Dare the Patrol Officer Break the Law When Ge Yuming was questioned, he said that he was suddenly accused and it was really inexplicable. Ge held the plaintiff's complaint in one hand and used hand gestures, eyebrow movements, secret talks, and abetting theft from the descriptions listed in the complaint, as well as the words such as wearing a pistol in the plaintiff's statement, to prove them one by one. In the end, he resolutely declared that he had received higher education and was currently a police officer, with the power to represent the country in enforcing laws and the responsibility to protect the people. How dare he commit such acts that violate laws and disciplines? If the judge finds out that this is the case, he is willing to accept the most severe punishment. If it is a false accusation, the plaintiff should be punished for filing a counterclaim, etc. After the lawyers of the plaintiff and defendant debated one after another, Judge Xu immediately declared Wei Suqin and Ge Yuming not guilty.</p>
<h3>Three Bandits Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>▲One Bandit's Last Words Forbid His Son from Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>▲Saying That the World Is Dark Now</p>
<p>Bandits Chen Zhida, Fan Xipu, Zhou Guiwu, etc., were jointly arrested by the Yangtonghui Concession Police for kidnapping Yang Tongzeng for ransom on November 29th of last year. They were interrogated by the former Provisional Court and sentenced Chen and the other two to death. The Jiangsu Provincial Government approved it. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangnian of the Special District Court ascended the third court, ordered the three prisoners to be presented to the case, and told them whether they had any last words on the day of their execution. According to Chen Zhida, he was from Tongzhou, 25 years old, and his home was on Tiantang Street. He used to be a sugar merchant. He asked to send a letter to his family to order them to collect his body and asked for wine and food. Fan Xipu said he was from Haimen, 34 years old, and had already written a letter to notify his family in the police station yesterday, so he had nothing else to say. Zhou Guiwu said he was from Huzhou, 41 years old, and asked to send a letter to his family, telling my son not to come to Shanghai because the world is dark now, and he had nothing else to say. Judge Cheng verified the confessions and ordered them to be sent to the local court for execution. The Western police took the three prisoners down, along with photos and files, and escorted them onto the prisoner car. They drove straight to the Caohejing execution ground. The local court appointed Prosecutor Lei Renlong as the supervising officer. He then ordered Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Inspector Chen Xihui, and executing police officers Gu Hanqing, Yin Dao Xu Guoguang, Wang Jianqing, Zhang Peilin, etc. to ride in cars and speed to the execution ground. After ascending the seat, they asked for the confessions of the three prisoners again. The prosecutor ordered the execution, and Police Chief Yang commanded the police to take them down and execute them by firing squad. The bodies were collected by the hall to wait for collection.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Between Uncle and Nephew</h3>
<p>Nephew Sues Uncle...Occupying Inheritance</p>
<p>Uncle Sues Nephew...Inheritance Issue</p>
<p>▲The Judge Urgently Persuades Both Parties to Reconcile</p>
<p>▲Shen Xinqi's Son Is the Key</p>
<p>Shen Guozuo, a resident of this city, has hired lawyer Wu Wushang to sue Shen Xinqi in the Shanghai Local Court for occupying the inheritance and requesting a judgment for its return. His argument is that the plaintiff's uncle, Shen Yangtong (also known as Xiande), had no offspring. His wife, Qin, remarried to Shen Xinqi (the defendant), Yangzhou’s younger brother. Yangzhou and the late father, Mingde, divided the property in the 19th year and established a written agreement, which stated that two houses were for housing. The front was for Mingde, and the back was for Xiande. There were a total of 63 mu of fields. In addition to giving Sister Suzhen 10 mu, they were divided into two shares equally. My mother and the older sister of Yin obtained one share, and the remaining two shares were divided equally between the brothers. It was also recorded that Uncle Ziqing borrowed 40 taels of silver, and the brothers each received half, etc. Since the death of Yangzhou, all the inheritance has been taken to the defendant Shen Xinqi by Qin and occupied until now. Now Qin has died, and it is said that the house has been sold by the defendant to the former tenant Yang Aqingshi as his property. There are still 13 mu of fields in Qingpu, which are collected and used by the defendant. The defendant is the younger brother of Yangzhou and has taken his wife and occupied his inheritance. After a meeting of relatives, the inheritance under the name of Yangzhou should be inherited by the plaintiff. Request a judgment to return it, etc. The defendant Shen Xinqi also hired lawyer Wen Chao to defend and filed an inheritance lawsuit. He has been summoned for trial to seek a conclusion. The official ordered an out-of-court settlement, which is on file.</p>
<p>▲The Property Dispute Is Heard First Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Yang Keqian specially opened the second court for a continued hearing. According to Shen Xinqi, 53 years old, from Shanghai, living at No. 352 Fangbang Road, this city, and opening the Huafeng Leather Company, the plaintiff Shen Guozuo, is my cousin. (The official asked) The plaintiff is suing you for the inheritance, how do you defend yourself? (Answer) He has no share. (The official asked) Is there any property? (Answer) Yes, it should be obtained by my son Shen Linsheng (8 years old). (The official asked) How much property is there? (Answer) Three houses upstairs and three downstairs, two bungalows, worth six to seven thousand gold. There are also 13 mu of fields in Qingpu, worth more than a thousand gold, etc. The questioning official questioned the plaintiff Shen Guozuo, 25 years old, living at No. 8, Huiguan Street, Laiyi Wharf, Nanshi. Yangzhou died without heirs. As a result of a meeting of relatives, the plaintiff should inherit it. Moreover, the defendant Shen Xinqi has no sons, only daughters, etc. At this point, Wang Wushang, the lawyer hired by the plaintiff, stood up and stated that the plaintiff and defendant are both members of the Catholic Church. If a child is born, holy water must be paid in the Catholic Church and the name left. An investigation of the old Catholic Church does not show Shen Linsheng. Moreover, the household registration book of the Public Security Bureau does not have Shen Linsheng's name. Now the defendant suddenly claims that his son Linsheng is eight years old, which is deeply surprising, etc. The questioning official advised the defendant to divide all the property equally with the plaintiff and said to both parties that the court was to settle matters and eliminate people. To avoid both parties from going to court, he also said to the defendant that according to you, you only have one eight-year-old son. The defendant said, "My wife is only 27 years old. Perhaps she will have two children in three years, which is unknown." The judge said, "Do you know how many you will have in the future? It is best to reconcile now. If a judgment is made, one party will lose, which is unfavorable to the economy, time, and emotions." He repeatedly persuaded the defendant and said to the lawyers of both parties, "The lawsuit in this case is suspended."</p>
<p>▲Continued Hearing of Inheritance Then another hearing was opened on the inheritance case filed by Shen Xinqi. The judge first asked Shen Xinqi, "How old is your son this year?" Answer, eight years old, named Shen Linsheng. The official said, "Linsheng is young. You are the guardian and should be the legal representative." (Answer) The issue of Yangzhou's succession was discussed at a family meeting on March 1st. Please rule it invalid. (The official asked) How do you request it? (Answer) Their illegal meeting should be repealed, and please confirm my son Shen Linsheng as the legal concurrent under the name of Yangzhou. (The official asked) How is the family meeting illegal? (Answer) Those who attended were all juniors. (The official asked) Who is the clan leader? Who is the family leader? (Answer) I am the family leader. As for the clan leader, I am the oldest on the male side. On the female side, there are still three old ladies, the mother of Shen Ziqin and the biological mother of Shen Zigang, and the adoptive mother of Shen Zigang. He also said that on the morning of March 1st, my family received a notice from the post office about the family meeting. At that time, I happened to be absent. (The official asked) They held a family meeting, and Shen Ziqin and Shen Zigang were present because his old mother was not present, so you objected? (Answer) Yes. The questioning official ordered witness Shen Yingxian to come to the case to testify, 42 years old, from Shanghai, living at No. 32, Xinxianli, Hugunying. (The official asked) Who is Shen Linsheng? (Answer) I don't know. (The official asked) What is Shen Xinqi to you? (Answer) Cousin. (The official asked) Did you attend the family meeting on March 1st of this year? (Answer) Yes, there were more than ten other relatives. Since Yangzhou’s death, Pengfei first inherited it, and then the court was involved in a lawsuit due to abolition of inheritance. Last November, when Guozuo got married, all the relatives gathered together and launched a meeting. (The official asked) Does Shen Xinqi have a son? (Answer) He has no sons. According to witness Shen Shaogeng, 71 years old, from Shanghai, living at No. 127 Tianzhu Road, Shen Xinqi is a distant nephew. Then the lawyers of both parties stood up and stated each other. The questioning official also (asked) Shen Xinqi, when was your son Linsheng born? (Answer) Born at 2:00 AM on the night of the third day of the tenth lunar month of the Republic of China, there are also two daughters, one is four years old, named Jugui, and the other is two years old, named Xinggui. At this point, lawyer Wang stood up and asked the court to investigate the old Catholic Church in Ma Yao Lane and the household registration book of the Chenxiangge Second District, First Office Police Station to see if there was the name of Shen Linsheng, and the truth would be clear. The questioning official said that this case still needs to be investigated and advised both parties to be able to reconcile out of court, which is best. The deadline is two weeks. If it cannot be reached, wait for a regular collective hearing and make a ruling according to the law.</p>

<p>Yang Huaijing, the director of the fifth district county public security bureau of Chonggu Town, Qingpu County, 32 years old, from Jiangbei, is capable and highly praised by the local people. Yesterday morning, more than a hundred bandits, all armed with pistols, Mauser pistols, and other weapons, rushed to rob the shops in the town. After hearing the news, Director Yang immediately led a team to suppress them. The two sides opened fire for several minutes. The bandits then fled in different directions to the surrounding countryside. Yang's right leg was hit by a bullet in the battle, and blood flowed like a river.

<h3>Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Punishes Drivers Who Violate Regulations</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau handled the registration and examination of motor vehicle drivers, the management of general motor vehicle drivers has been extremely strict, especially for those who drive public buses, because there are many passengers on public buses and the relationship is extremely important and must be specially paid attention to. The day before yesterday, the bureau's vehicle inspectors inspected the Zhenru area and found that Yang Shixiang, a Chinese public bus driver, was holding the wheel with one hand and smoking with the other while driving. Liu Jinlin, one of them, was chatting with people while driving. Li Yuanxi was driving without closing the door. Someone was standing on the footboard. Another one was using Li Tianhe's driver's license. All of them violated the regulations. The bureau imposed penalties according to the seriousness of the circumstances, including Yang Shixiang and Liu Jinlin, who each had their licenses revoked for three months. Li Yuanxi had his license revoked for two months. Li Tianhe was fined and revoked his license for four months for lending his license to others without authorization. The one who used the license without authorization has been ordered to investigate the person to clarify the bureau. In addition to being punished according to the regulations, it must also be sent to the public security bureau district office for punishment in accordance with the police law to warn others.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Repairs Qingning Temple Ferry Pier</h3>
<p>The municipal Puxi Donggou ferry service has three berthing locations: Xidu Qingning Temple and Donggou. On the Donggou side, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has built a wooden pier on Pubin, which is convenient for passengers. Xidu temporarily uses small boats to ferry passengers up and down. There is an old reinforced concrete pier at Qingning Temple, which was built by the former Pudong Tanggong Rehabilitation Bureau. The current municipal ferry stops here. However, the construction project of the pier is not suitable for the increasingly developed new ferry. (1) Because it cannot rise and fall with the tide like a floating pier, the pier is low and the boat is high when the tide rises, and the pier is high and the boat is low when the tide falls, which is inconvenient for passengers to get on and off. (2) The concrete lacks elasticity. Each time the new ferry stops in the wind and waves, the pier is shaken once. Many of the concrete piles have been damaged as a result. Director Huang of the bureau has previously invited experts to conduct an on-site inspection and believes that only a new floating pier can be built to solve the problem once and for all, but the cost is too high and it is temporarily difficult to hold it. It can only replace the damaged parts with new piles to meet the current needs of ship berthing. It is now known that it has been approved by the municipal government and funds have been allocated from the ferry business income for repairs, which will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Bans Asking for Divine Medicine</h3>
<p>The Second District Party Department of this city believes that asking for divine medicine is misleading and endangers lives. Government bans have been repeatedly declared, but the temples still comply in public and disobey in private, which is extremely harmful. It has specially been approved by the City Party Department and transferred to the Municipal Government to reiterate the ban. It is heard that the Municipal Government has transferred orders to the Social Public Security and Health Bureaus to comply with it in order to eliminate superstition and value people's lives.</p>

<h3>Rectifying Court Order in the Special District Local Court</h3>
<p>▲ Lawyers Must Be Notified</p>
<p>▲ Before Entering the Court to Wait for Trial</p>
<p>Since the Special District Local Court implemented the visitor's pass system, people not related to the case have found it difficult to obtain the pass and are unable to enter the courtroom. Therefore, the number of spectators in civil and criminal court hearings has decreased compared to the past. The court president, Yang Zhao-yun, issued a public notice yesterday to inform the public and printed regulations regarding entering the court with passes, which were posted outside each courtroom to clarify the procedures for those attending court for cases. President Yang also stated that the court has a dedicated lawyer's lounge. All lawyers representing parties or acting as defenders must wait in the lounge. When the judge calls the case they represent, the court clerk will notify them to enter the court. The same applies to lawyers appointed by the court for daily defense duties. If lawyers are temporarily entrusted by litigants to act as agents or defenders, they must first submit the letter of authorization to the presiding judge for review and can only enter the court during the trial. With these revisions, there will be no overcrowding in the courtroom, but a lack of waiting areas may be felt.</p>
<h3>Investigating and Prohibiting the Pudong Savings Society Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government issued an order to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating: "According to a document from the Ministry of Finance, a report on the results of the 27th issue of the Pudong Savings Society lottery tickets in March of this year was published, listing three prizes each for first, second, and third places, six prizes for fourth place, eighteen prizes for fifth place, three hundred prizes for sixth place, as well as the last digit numbers, and specifying the collection locations. Such unauthorized issuance of lottery tickets is a clear violation of the prohibition. The Ministry has previously reported on the Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank and the China Savings Bank issuing lottery notices.</p>
<p>We have repeatedly consulted your government to investigate and prohibit these actions. This time, the Pudong Commercial &amp; Savings Bank dares to disregard the law, ostensibly under the guise of savings, but secretly issuing lottery tickets, harming the people, which is extremely hateful. Based on the previous situation, we respectfully request that you investigate and strictly prohibit it, punish them according to law, and order the bank to liquidate the deposits of all depositors to prevent imitation." The order has been approved and sent to the Social Affairs Bureau. You are hereby ordered to immediately comply with the order, coordinate the handling of the matter, and submit a report. This order is issued.</p>

<p>▲ Drivers' Strike for Five Days</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Manager Insists on His Own Way</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Public Bus Company, due to the failure to meet the demands of all drivers for increased wages, went on strike, resulting in the complete suspension of all bus routes, which has now lasted for five days.

Each bus had a Russian driver in the front, an instructor standing on the right side, and an armed Western policeman from the police station on the left side for protection. There were five or six company employees in the bus, driving on routes such as Myburgh Road, Sampan Factory, Jiaozhou Road, Gordon Road, Robertison Road, Jessfield Road, Brenan Road, Connaught Road, etc., practicing back and forth until they returned to the depot in the evening.

<h3>Wang Da-Xi's Conflicting Testimony to Escape Punishment</h3>
<p>▲ Xu Tian-Fu's Crime Has Been Proven</p>
<p>▲ Judge Feng Sheds Light on the Truth</p>
<p>▲ Resulting in a Sentence of Eight Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Wang Da-Xi-Zi, a messenger at the Gongxing Salt Shop on Yuanfang Road, went to the Gonghe steamboat at the Jardine Matheson Wharf to sell salt on the afternoon of the 16th of last month. Coincidentally, personnel from the Garrison Command were searching the ship and discovered a large amount of opium. Afterwards, the opium dealers suspected that Wang had reported them, and instigated more than ten ruffians to rush into the Gongxing Salt Shop and beat Wang with wooden sticks before scattering. The Hongkou police sent detectives to take the injured Wang to the hospital for treatment and arrested Xu Tian-Fu from Zhenjiang and Qian Chang-Fa, both principals in the attack. At that time, Wang was seriously injured, and the police feared he might not survive, so they took Xu and Qian to the hospital for Wang to identify. Wang identified both men as being present at the scene, with Xu slapping him twice on the cheeks before ordering the crowd to attack. The next day, during the court interrogation, Wang Xiao-San-Zi also testified that Xu and Qian were both present, with Xu slapping Wang Da-Xi-Zi's cheeks before ordering the crowd to attack, thus confirming Xu's involvement in the assault. By the time of the second court hearing, Wang Da-Xi-Zi's injuries had gradually healed, and he personally appeared in court and changed his previous testimony, stating that he was confused when being treated at the hospital and mistakenly identified Xu and Qian as being present at the scene. Now, after careful consideration, he was certain that the two men were not present, that Xu did not slap his cheeks, and that the person who assaulted him was shorter than Xu. The testimony was greatly contradictory. Fortunately, Judge Feng Shi-De, who was presiding over the case, had discerned the true circumstances of the case. Yesterday afternoon, at the time for the announcement of the verdict, the police escorted the two defendants, Xu and Qian, to the Fifth Court of the Special District Local Court. Judge Feng again ascended the bench and pronounced the verdict: Xu Tian-Fu was sentenced to eight months imprisonment, and Qian Chang-Fa was found not guilty. After the judgment, Xu's lawyer, Fan Gang, stated that Xu Tian-Fu was still not convinced and would file an appeal. Judge Feng then instructed that Xu Tian-Fu still had to post a bail of 1,000 yuan and Qian Chang-Fa still had to post a bail of 500 yuan during the appeal period, pending transfer to the Higher Branch Court for review.</p>

They were arrested by Chinese Constable No. 63, who confiscated a bundle of flyers and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French Court for investigation. First, the police chief reported the situation and presented the flyers. Then, Constable No. 63 testified about the defendants' actions. Zhang Yao-Xing and Lü Zeng-Shou claimed that they were instructed to post the flyers by a person surnamed Hu and did not know it was illegal. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Zhang and Lü to one year of imprisonment in the Western prison each as a warning, and the flyers were destroyed.</p>

While playing in the street and pushing each other, Sun was hit by car No. 16266. He was taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but died of his injuries on the afternoon of the day before yesterday. The police took the body to the forensic examination office on Rue Frelupt. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu from the Special District Local Court came to the office to examine the body. The driver, Jin Ru-Bao, claimed that it was not his fault. Sun Qiu-Tao, the father of the deceased, requested that the driver provide 300 yuan as compensation, but Jin firmly refused. After repeated mediation by Prosecutor Xu, Jin finally agreed to pay 60 yuan. The judge instructed Sun Qiu-Tao to sign a statement accepting the body for burial. The 60 yuan in compensation paid by Jin Ru-Bao was to be handed over to the family of the deceased through the police station.</p>
<h3>Exemption from Autopsy Granted for Zhuang Xue's Body</h3>
<p>The case of Zhuang Xue-Qing, also known as Zhuang Jin-Hua, of No. 12 Zhuangjiazhai, Pudong, who committed suicide by smoking opium due to the persecution of his adoptive mother, Zhuang Zhang-Shi, in a lawsuit, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, Xie A-Long, the local warden of the 24th district, reported the case to the local court for an autopsy. Zhuang Yang-Shi, the wife of the deceased, also filed a case, claiming that her husband was adopted by his aunt at the age of 16 because his uncle had passed away and there was no one to take care of the funeral arrangements. After her husband's adoption, he took care of the funeral and supported the family. In 1923, due to the marriage of Zhuang Zhang-Shi's daughter, Zhang Bao, to the son of Xu Pu, they were alienated and became entangled in lawsuits for many years. Recently, the land deed was retrieved, and a criminal lawsuit was filed, resulting in a fourfold encirclement by lawsuits. After her husband's adoption, he was unable to obtain his biological parents' property and now faced expulsion, causing him great distress and leading him to commit suicide. She claimed it was tantamount to being forced to death, but she was powerless to resist and requested an exemption from the autopsy. Prosecutor Lei opened a preliminary hearing and stated that since it was a suicide, an autopsy could be waived. He instructed Zhuang Yang-Shi that an exemption from the autopsy was granted and to proceed with the funeral arrangements for her deceased husband. If there were any disputes, she should file a petition with the court after the arrangements were completed for review.</p>
<h3>Maidservant's Promiscuous Affair Leads to a Vicious Brawl</h3>
<p>▲ Feng Chen-Shi Violently Assaulted by He Xue-Qing and His Gang</p>
<p>Feng Sheng-Kun, from Meili, Changshu, has a wife named Chen, who is in her early twenties. They have been married for four years. Feng used to be a foreman at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and his financial situation was relatively stable. However, in the spring of last year, he suddenly suffered from hemiplegia, and his medical treatment was ineffective, leading to the termination of his business and leaving him bedridden in his hometown. Chen was forced to come to Shanghai in the autumn and was recommended by an employment agency to work as a domestic helper at the Lin residence on Seymour Road in the Public Concession. Chen is beautiful, and although she wears old and patched clothes, she still has a natural charm. Having just arrived in the bustling city of Shanghai, she immediately forgot about her husband's suffering in the countryside. There were many male and female servants at the Lin residence, and Chen soon developed a relationship with He Xue-Qing, the cook. Before long, she also had an affair with Shen A-Er, the chauffeur. In January of this year, He and Shen quarreled and fought over her, and the master fired both of them, along with Chen. Chen then rented a small house with Shen A-Er in the Yipin Lane on Baoshan Road in the Chinese territory, where they lived together like husband and wife. He Xue-Xiang found out about this and was consumed by jealousy. He asked someone to write a letter to Feng Shao-Qing, and yesterday, he gathered many accomplices, each hiding iron weapons, and ambushed near the lane in the evening. At around 9 PM, Chen indeed returned home from the concession without stopping. At He's signal, they swarmed out and violently beat Chen. By the time the patrol police arrived after hearing the cries for help, the group had already scattered. Chen was taken by car to the precinct office, but her injuries were quite severe and she was fading fast, so she was transferred to a nearby hospital for treatment. It is said that her chest and abdomen were beaten with iron rulers, and her life is in great danger.</p>
<h3>Prostitute Unable to Bear Debt Pressure</h3>
<p>▲ Secretly Consumes Opium Paste to End Her Life</p>
<p>Qian Zhou-Shi, a woman from Suzhou, has two daughters who are both prostitutes. The elder daughter is named Jin-Bao, and the younger daughter is named Jin-E. Their brothels are both located at No. 432 Minhe Lane, Guangxi Road. Jin-E is in her prime (26 years old), stubborn by nature, and rarely smiles. Although she is in the powder and rouge business, she is not good at flattery, which leads to few visitors and rare carriages at her door. Because she rents the room herself, she has to worry about daily expenses, and her debts are increasing. Unable to make ends meet, she conceived the idea of death. At 6 AM on the 21st, she secretly swallowed opium paste in her dressing room. An hour later, her sister Jin-Bao pushed open the door and saw that her beloved sister's face had changed dramatically, turning pale. She asked her, but she did not answer. She checked her body and found an opium box in her bosom with a little opium juice left. Only then did she realize that she had taken opium and immediately sent her to Baolong Hospital. Unfortunately, the poison had entered her lungs, and medicine was ineffective. She died around 9 AM. When the bad news spread, not only was her sister deeply saddened, but the other sisters in the brothel also shed tears. Her mother, Qian Zhou-Shi, received the news in her hometown and rushed to the scene in the afternoon. However, according to the hospital's regulations, all such incidents must be reported to the police. Therefore, the hospital notified the Old Gate Police Station and sent detectives to take the body to the forensic examination office on Rue Frelupt. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Xu from the Special District Local Court came to the office to examine the body and inquire about the cause of death. He instructed Qian Zhou-Shi to sign a statement to claim the body for burial.</p>

Unexpectedly, after dinner, she felt an unusual headache and groaned in bed, instructing someone to buy a bottle of Varamon tablets from a nearby pharmacy and emptying the bottle by taking all the tablets. Unfortunately, the anesthetic effect of the tablets was too strong, leading to her death. She stopped breathing at around 10 AM the next morning. She was taken to Renji Hospital, but soon passed away. The hospital reported the case to the Old Gate Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate and took the body to the forensic examination office for examination.</p>
<h3>Two Women Die From Poisoning</h3>
<p>(1) Fang Fu-Quan, a blacksmith from Wuxi, lived at No. 35 Donghai Lane, Tangjiawan in the French Concession. His wife, Zhu, was 45 years old this year and had a strong passion for gambling, especially for the flower game. She gambled whenever she had money, and consistently lost, leading to a heavy debt burden. Recently, creditors were pressing for payment, and she was unable to make amends, leading to frequent quarrels between the couple. She suddenly had suicidal thoughts. On the night of the 21st, she secretly swallowed raw opium to commit suicide. By the time her husband found out, she was already groaning from the poison. He immediately reported it to the Lujiawan French Police Station, and she was taken to Renji Hospital. Due to the deep poison, rescue efforts were ineffective, and she died the following afternoon. The hospital notified the police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuantang forensic examination office. Yesterday morning, her husband went to the police station to request an exemption from the autopsy and offered to collect the body himself for burial. The police chief approved, and her husband purchased clothing and a coffin and hastily arranged the burial. (2) Qin Ning-Hai, a tailor from Pudong, lived upstairs from a shoe store at the intersection of Avenue du Docteur Dubail and Route des Soeurs. He was 45 years old, and his wife, Ye, was 36 years old from Chongming. Recently, due to being very busy with business, he planned to add an assistant, but his wife prevented him. As a result, he still added one person, leading to arguments. He was already depressed, and at around 5 AM yesterday morning, while her husband Ning-Hai was fast asleep, she secretly swallowed opium paste to commit suicide. By the time Qin discovered it at around 9 AM, he quickly hired a car to take her to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Because the poison had already damaged her heart, her life was in great danger.</p>
<h3>Two People Electrocuted to Death</h3>
<p>▲ Huang Li-Qing: Huang Li-Qing, from Shandong, opened a sesame cake shop at No. 1309 North Jiangxi Road.

<p>Shen Xia-Shi, a woman from Suzhou residing at No. 93 Rue Amiral Bayle, ordered her 13-year-old maid, Qin A-Xiu, to deliver invitation cards in a gift box to a relative's house at 4 PM the day before yesterday. The girl delivered the cards, but Shen Xia-Shi initially thought she had not, and used a wooden stick to violently beat the girl, causing injuries to her arms, back, and ears. Later, she learned that the cards had indeed been delivered, but the girl had been abused for no reason. Therefore, A-Xiu took the opportunity to escape and requested assistance from the Xinzha Police Station. The police chief instructed a detective to send the girl to the Jiliang Institute and confirmed that Shen Xia-Shi was indeed violent and arrested her. A-Xiu was examined by a doctor at the institute, who confirmed the injuries and issued a medical certificate. Yesterday morning, the woman was brought to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Luo interrogated her. A-Xiu described the abuse she suffered from her mistress. Shen Xia-Shi claimed that A-Xiu was the daughter of a former employee whom she had adopted and was teaching her to sing in operas. She claimed that the girl had been beaten by the teacher, not by her. Her lawyer, Fan Gang, defended her. Judge Luo ruled that the defendant's assault was proven and sentenced her to a fine of 30 yuan. If she was unable to pay, she would be imprisoned for one day for every two yuan. Qin A-Xiu would remain at the Jiliang Institute pending recognition by relatives.</p>

<h3>Upper Yangtze Steamships to All Resume Operations</h3>
<p>▲ 28 Foreign Steamships Resume Operations</p>
<p>▲ Chinese Merchant Ships Are Again Obstructed</p>
<p>The Yangzi River steamships have been on strike for more than a month since the helmsmen demanded a pay raise. After the American merchant Yangtze Rapid Steamship Company first recognized the pay increase and resumed service, the British merchant Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. also accepted the helmsmen's demands, appropriately increased wages, and quickly resumed service, following the American steamships. In addition, after suspending its Upper Yangtze ships in Shanghai due to the strike, the Nissin Steamship Co., Ltd. recently saw that the Yangtze River above Yichang was urgently needed by Chinese merchants and the total blockage of the Yangtze River steamships had again caused obstruction, the company also negotiated separately with the helmsmen and agreed to increase their wages according to the amount recognized by the American steamships, and has also resumed operations. The Yunyang Maru, Changyang Maru, and Yiyang Maru, etc., which were docked in Shanghai, have already sailed to Chongqing. Within this week, ten British and Japanese Upper Yangtze steamships, which had been docked in Shanghai, have sailed upstream to resume service. However, the Taikoo Company's steamships are still under negotiation, and it is expected to be resolved within three days. There are a total of twenty-nine foreign steamships on the Yangtze River route, and they will all resume operations.</p>

<h3>Jiagutang Appeals for Donations to Cover Losses From Stabilizing Rice Prices</h3>
<p>Rice prices in Shanghai are soaring due to the limited supply. Although the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has issued a notice restricting the maximum price of white rice to 20 yuan per stone, the market has not eased in recent days. Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau believes that since the new harvest is still far away, there will be a rice shortage crisis unless foreign rice is purchased to provide relief. Therefore, with the approval of the municipal government, it is planned to purchase a large quantity of foreign rice to sell at a flat price in Shanghai to help the people. A food rice flat price committee has been organized, members have been appointed, and a flat price program will be launched on a regular basis. The rice industry association will be responsible for purchasing, and the Jigu Hall rice store will be responsible for distribution. All losses from flat rice sales, in addition to being borne separately by the municipal government's commercial adjustment committee and various groups, the Jigu Hall rice store guild has been assigned to raise 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, the guild convened a committee meeting and decided on the measures to undertake the flat rice program, roughly dividing the north and south of the city into eight districts, each with a distribution point. The guild will consult with nearby rice stores to assign staff to manage the distribution points. The funds raised will be collected from various stores by the guild committee members, and the Jigu Hall Committee for Fundraising for Flat Rice Losses will be organized to notify all rice shops to enthusiastically donate. The original letter states: "Respectfully, due to poor harvests in various rice-producing areas this year and a shortage of rice arrivals, prices are gradually rising. Rice-producing areas such as Changshu and Jinshan have even issued orders prohibiting rice from leaving the region. In the future, there may be a shortage of food for the people. Now, with the instruction of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in order to raise food rice for 2.5 million citizens, it has been decided to purchase a large quantity of foreign rice and sell it at a flat price. A flat price committee has been organized to regularly manage the flat price program by district to benefit the common people. However, expenses and flat rice losses require funds everywhere. In addition to the municipal government and commercial adjustment committees and other groups separately raising funds, our rice shop industry association has been assigned to raise 10,000 yuan. This money is specifically used to cover losses from flat rice sales. For the sake of maintaining rice for the common people, our industry should generously provide assistance. It has been decided that starting today, donations will be solicited from various rice shops, divided into three levels: 30 yuan, 20 yuan, and 10 yuan. We have always admired your esteemed store's enthusiasm for public welfare and charity. Please give your full support and enthusiastically donate generously. Temporary receipts will be issued by our association for donations and sent to the bank for storage. This is specially conveyed. Jigu Hall Committee for Fundraising for Flat Rice Losses."</p>
<h3>The Dispute Between the Fish Market Workers and the Tram Workers Has Been Resolved</h3>
<p>The dispute between the Public Fish Market workers and the French tram workers at Xiaodongmen over price disagreements has been resolved. Through the mediation of a certain gentleman, the first shift of the market apologized to all the French tram workers and donated several loads of fish to charitable organizations. This incident has now been concluded.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Robbery at West Gouyu Lane</h3>
<p>Hu Bokang, a local resident, aged fifty, engaged in the rice business, resided at No. 52, West Gouyu Lane, outside Xiaonanmen. The house was occupied by three families. Besides Hu, one was Lu Jialin, who worked at Zhang Youji Construction Factory, and the other was a local old woman, Dan Gao (a widow). Around 9 AM yesterday, four robbers suddenly arrived, using the pretext of asking for someone. They broke into the house. One robber immediately took out a pistol, distributed it to the others, and ordered one robber to guard the door outside. The remaining robbers entered the living room, threatening everyone to remain silent. Lu Jialin happened to be at home. Hearing the commotion, he went to investigate and realized that robbers had arrived. He spoke to the robbers, saying, "You're here for money, no doubt. Speak plainly. Please don't resort to violence." The robbers replied, "We are from a certain organization stationed in Shanghai. Today, because the team leader is not home, Section Chief Dong led us here. We are short on military pay, so we've come to your residence to borrow 10,000 silver dollars, which we will return later." Lu thought the amount was too large and repeatedly pleaded to reduce it to 1,000 dollars, but they refused. With no other options, Lu had to let them drive him into the small living room, where one robber watched him. The other two robbers divided and ransacked the bedrooms of the three families. Except for Dan Gao's house, which had nothing of value, they seized the cash, silver dollars, pearls, gold and silver jewelry, and clothing from the other two families, worth over 1,000 dollars in total. They then gave a signal, took the loot, and left in large strides.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Requests a One-Month Extension</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association of this city is currently soliciting members and raising funds, divided into forty teams in other cities and sixty teams in this city, each aiming for 200 dollars, totaling 20,000 dollars. Since the fundraising began, although the team leaders have been enthusiastic, it is currently the Qingming Festival, and many fellow villagers have returned home to sweep the tombs. The amount raised is still far from the original goal. Therefore, the last executive meeting decided to grant a one-month extension and send representatives to liaise with the team leaders, hoping to achieve the goal.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Hires Technical Personnel on Behalf</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau of this city has recently been entrusted by a certain municipal organization to hire three technicians and three technical assistants, limited to civil engineering, mechanical engineering, and architecture specialties. Applicants must have considerable experience. Those interested in being hired can state their experience in a letter and send it to the bureau for contact. If qualified, the bureau will arrange an interview to make a decision.</p>
<h3>Lost Boy Waiting to Be Claimed</h3>
<p>A patrol officer from the Sixth District Police Station in Caojiadu, Shanghai West, brought back a lost boy yesterday morning on Great Western Road. According to the boy's statement, his name is Wu Liangfu, nine years old, from Changzhou. He came to Shanghai with his father three days ago. The address is unknown. He wandered off while playing alone and got lost. He only knows that he has a young aunt named Duanduan, who works in the fine yarn section of a yarn factory. Other information is vague. The boy has a shaved head and is wearing a short blue plaid cloth jacket. He is currently being held at the police station, waiting for his family to claim him.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the Yangtze River basin is cloudy with thunderstorms, due to a secondary low-pressure center moving eastward. There is a cyclone to the west of Kyushu. The south winds in the Yangtze River basin and the Ma'an Islands are strengthening and becoming erratic, with occasional light fog. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 86.7 degrees and the lowest was 62.2 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 82.8 degrees and the lowest was 54.5 degrees.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Sea Wanderer</p>
<p>▲A｜Old Bing said I look like you.</p>
<p>B｜That's absurd! If I ever meet him, I'll give him a beating.</p>
<p>A｜Don't bother. I already beat him up, because I don't think I'm that unattractive. How could I possibly look like you?</p>
<p>▲A｜Are you still learning to paint?</p>
<p>B｜I quit long ago, because I didn't like the teacher.</p>
<p>A｜Why?</p>
<p>B｜He said if I studied hard, I could make a living painting doors, windows, and walls in the future.</p>
<p>▲Wife A｜Yesterday, I washed our child's pants. After drying, they shrank so much that he can't wear them anymore.</p>
<p>Wife B｜Why don't you wash your child for a while? Maybe he'll shrink, and then he'll be able to wear the pants.</p>
<p>▲Brother｜I'm the older brother. I should get to eat everything first.</p>
<p>▲Sister｜Don't you know the customs of civilized countries? In everything, women come before men.</p>
<p>Brother｜Then why didn't you rush out ahead of me when you were born, and instead fell behind?</p>
<h3>New Medical Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Li Shuping</p>
<p>Dr. Wasserman of the Berlin Weiyang Hospital recently made a courageous and surprising new contribution to the medical community. He used a soft rubber tube inserted through the vein in the elbow into the small opening at the right end of the heart chamber for six and a half hours, without any dangerous changes occurring in the heart chamber or blood vessels. The doctor proved that injecting drugs into the heart chamber and various organs in this way is safer and faster than other methods. The tube only needs three or four seconds to travel from the elbow to the heart. If a patient is anesthetized and injected with this device, they can wake up within ten minutes.</p>
<p>Dr. Muwang, a dermatologist in Paris, strongly advises against using too much soap, because modern soaps contain too much fragrance and alkali, which can hinder the natural nutrition and protective power of our skin and make it susceptible to disease. It is best to use soap to wash towels and clothes, but avoid direct contact with the skin. Those who already have skin diseases should absolutely avoid soap, as it is not only useless but can also be harmful.</p>
<p>Dr. Aben Iman, a professor in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Berlin, gave a lecture on his new medical experiences during class, which greatly aroused the students' interest. The doctor said that patients with lung disease should pay special attention to the color of their clothing. The most taboo colors are dark colors such as blue and red, because they can prevent light from passing through. White is the most suitable color, followed by light blue and light purple. In general, it is best to use colors that easily allow light to pass through, so that sunlight can come into contact with the skin and exert its sterilizing effect.</p>
<p>Three French medical professors have invented a new method to prevent the transmission of lung disease, which involves using a sterilizing powder inhaled through a respirator. It is said that this new method has been tested on more than 200 people, all of whom are in frequent contact with patients with lung disease. At the same time, the same drug was used to vaccinate several dozen other people, also allowing them to come into contact with tuberculosis patients. The former method yielded very good results, while the injection method was slightly less effective.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on the Memorial Service for Mr. Zheng Zhegu</h3>
<p>— Cai Chusheng</p>
<p>In the past, I stayed in the South and had a keen interest in drama. After studying it, I paid close attention to the current situation of the art world in Shanghai. Friends returning from Shanghai often praised Mr. Zhegu, which made me yearn for him. In 1928, I arrived in Shanghai and learned that Mr. Zheng had already passed away. The art world had lost a steadfast central figure, which caused me to mourn for a long time. Last year, when I joined the Mingxing Film Company, I met Mr. Zheng's son, Shi Hui. Shi Hui was kind and approachable, and particularly resolute in his work. Colleagues often said that Shi Hui's kindness and sincerity were reminiscent of his father. I deeply rejoiced that Mr. Zheng had such a worthy successor. The 20th of this month marked the fifth anniversary of Mr. Zheng's death. Beforehand, his old friends, such as Zhang Shichuan, Zheng Zhengqiu, Zhou Jianyun, and Dong Tianya, believed that Mr. Zheng's spirit could not be comforted if his final resting place was not settled. Therefore, they chose a site in the International Cemetery and held a burial ceremony yesterday, along with a memorial service in the International Cemetery Auditorium. In addition to all the staff of Mingxing Film Company, many relatives and friends attended. In the early morning, a ceremony was held on the grounds. The coffin was moved out of the auditorium. After playing mournful music, it was slowly placed into the tomb. At this moment, all the male and female stars, who were usually joking and laughing, all lowered their heads in silence, and some even sobbed. I knew that there must be a lot of grief and emotion in everyone's minds. When the coffin was lowered, Mr. Shichuan and Mr. Zhengqiu arrived late due to other engagements. Seeing their old friend already covered by yellow earth, they couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>At nine o'clock, a ritual was held in the auditorium. At ten o'clock, the memorial service began. First, Chairman Zhengqiu reported the reasons for holding the meeting, saying that with Mr. Zhegu's experience and knowledge, if he had been granted more years, he would have made greater contributions to our art world. Therefore, Mr. Zheng's death was not only a loss for Mingxing, but also a loss for our entire art world. At the most sorrowful points, he choked up and could barely speak. I could imagine how close they were in their younger days. Then, Mr. Lu Runqing reported on Mr. Zheng's life, and Mr. Zhou Jianyun gave a speech on Mr. Zheng's efforts, especially elaborating on Mr. Zheng's hard work, self-motivation, and dedication to the interests of the majority. Mr. Zhou and Mr. Zheng were close friends, so he knew the details. Thinking of their personal friendship, he also shed tears. Next was a speech by Mr. Zhang Shichuan. Mr. Zhang spent the most time with Mr. Zheng during the difficult process of creating Mingxing Film Company. Now that Mingxing was gradually becoming successful, Mr. Zheng had left his old friends. Therefore, when Mr. Zhang spoke of the hardships of planning all night with Mr. Zheng and others in a cramped room before Mingxing became successful, he burst into tears and covered his face. At this time, all that could be heard in the entire venue was sobbing, and no one else could stand up and give a speech. After a few minutes of silence, Mr. Shi Hui gave a reply and the chairman gave a closing speech, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>A Strange Tale of a Mouse Thief</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yan</p>
<p>Mice are small animals that live in holes in people's houses and rely on stealing food to survive. Damaging utensils and gnawing on clothes and shoes are their usual tricks. Therefore, many families keep cats to catch them. My friend Mr. He recently encountered a strange case of mice stealing eggs, which is quite amusing. It is rare for mice to be able to act as thieves. Therefore, I have recorded it and submitted it to this column for a laugh.</p>
<p>My colleague, Mr. He Xiaoyun, always eats three raw eggs after bathing every morning. He has been doing this for a long time. Recently, because the weather is getting hotter, he is afraid that the eggs will not be fresh, so he asks a servant to buy three eggs every night to prepare for breakfast the next morning. However, every morning when he opens the drawer, one or two eggs are often missing. At first, he didn't care, but then he found it strange. So he suspected the servant. Yesterday, Mr. He wanted to know the truth, so he imitated Sherlock Holmes and conducted an investigation. He sat upright and waited. At about two o'clock in the middle of the night, he faintly heard a sound from the drawer. So he held his breath and watched from afar. After about two minutes, he heard a faint sound again, as if something was breaking out of the drawer. Mr. He stared intently and suddenly realized what was happening. He secretly smiled. The thief was none other than a mouse. And its stealing technique was ingenious and indescribable. One mouse was lying on its back, tightly holding an egg with its four feet. Another mouse was dragging it with its tail, moving very quickly. At this point, Mr. He couldn't help but laugh out loud. The two mice were startled and abandoned the egg, scurrying away in panic.</p>
<h3>White Tea</h3>
<p>— Xiaochang</p>
<p>Xiaofeng's North Tianmu Maling Ridge is a famous tea mountain. The tea produced there is no less good than Longjing tea. On the mountainside, there is an ancient temple called Jinguang Temple. Beside the temple, there are several acres of mountains, which belong to the temple. There are dozens of wild tea trees, all with tall trunks and lush branches. The tender leaves drawn from the village head are white as jade. After roasting, they are slightly yellow. When brewed, it tastes clear and fragrant. It is truly a unique product among teas.</p>
<p>The white tea is famous far and wide. The tea shops in Xiaoyi compete to reserve it from the temple in the winter of the previous year. However, the production of this tea is small, only about ten kilograms per year. Therefore, each family that reserves it only gets about half a kilogram or a few ounces. After each shop obtains it, they do not seek a profit of one in ten. Instead, they distribute it to tea shops with which they have business dealings in Shanghai, Ningbo, Suzhou, and Hangzhou. But each family is only given a little more than an ounce, because the item is rare and expensive, and it is not easy to obtain. It is said that in recent years, the price of this tea has been more than one silver dollar per ounce.</p>
<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (17)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>There is also a strange tree called the Traveler's Palm (TrarellersPalm), which is also a type of coconut tree. The tree contains sap and is also known as the Nectar Tree. Travelers who are extremely hot and thirsty are delighted to find this tree. Hence, it is named the Traveler's Palm.</p>
<p>It was very difficult to go out on the streets on the 23rd. The first difficulty was the street names, which were a mix of English and Chinese, and completely unrelated. The English pronunciation was completely different from the Chinese characters, and the pronunciation was in the Min and Cantonese dialects. Every road was called a "line." The second difficulty was the lack of Chinese maps. Eight out of ten people here are Chinese, but there hasn't been a Chinese street map for decades. This is a shame for culture. It can be seen that among the intellectuals in this place, except for certain professions, no one is responsible for organizing cultural research groups. And a group of operators only care about personal immediate interests and lack foresight. The weakness of our people's self-governance is evident here. The third difficulty was that there was no right to speak when hiring rickshaws, etc. Because everyone here is from Min and Yue, especially in the labor world, they don't speak Mandarin. Moreover, it is impossible to ride rickshaws here, because they don't know the way. The passenger must know the way and direct them east or west. They are not responsible for the route at all. This is different from the interior of the country. For example, when calling a rickshaw, I say I want to go to the North Railway Station. The passenger is not responsible for anything in between. This is very strange, but in fact, the rickshaw pullers suffer even more than us. We should think for them. We understand Chinese, English, and common language, and it is still not easy to understand the words marked on the streets. How can they, who don't know a single word, understand? Another strange thing is that people here mostly ride in rickshaws in pairs. Their rickshaws are taller and larger than those in Shanghai. It is an exception for one person to ride alone. "When entering a country, ask about its taboos; when entering a territory, ask about its customs." If this was the interior of China, two men riding in one rickshaw would be a violation of the police law. The lack of a unified movement for the national language and national writing here is a major reason for the segregation of the overseas Chinese community.</p>
<p>Li Juncheng visited on the 24th. Li is a disciple of Master Yinguang and is capable of poetry. His poetry is close to that of Bai Juyi, rich and detailed. He has many famous lines. I remember one line, "There are good lines but no insights." His close friend is Zheng Ziying, who is also capable of poetry. He is more vigorous and unrestrained than Li. Li said that the Chamber of Commerce will invite me to give a lecture.</p>
<p>On the 25th, Zhuang Duding and Zhuang Duming, the directors of the Chamber of Commerce, came to invite me to give a lecture. They also said that it would be appropriate to give a lecture in other circles after giving a lecture in the Chamber of Commerce. I agreed and visited Xue Xiulan and Li Weinan, the chairmen of the Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>On the 26th, I visited Zheng Yantian with Li Jun. We didn't meet him. The next day, Zheng brought a small poem. He is also a poetry friend of Li.</p>
<p>On the 27th, I visited people from various newspaper offices. When I first arrived, foreign newspapers had already reported on my lecture on global female pacifists. Chinese newspapers had published many of my proposals for reforming the world, and also published my photo. A Westerner visited and I gave him an English book, instructing him to promote it. Today, Comrade Zhang Xuan arrived from Hong Kong. Because his colleagues in Shanghai were stopping in Hong Kong for a few days, he only arrived today.</p>
<h3>Record of the Philippine Chinese Assembly</h3>
<p>— Yan Wenchao from the Philippines</p>
<p>The Philippine Carnival is now open again this year. The architecture of the exhibition grounds changes in form every year, giving it a new look. This year, it is in the style of an ancient Arabian palace, magnificent and gorgeous, reminiscent of the heroic spirit of the Moorish kingdom that built a state in West Asia during the Middle Ages. More than 35,000 electric lights are arranged throughout the grounds. A lighthouse more than ten feet tall stands in the center of the grounds, serving as the center of the entire venue. At night, all the torches are lit, truly making the city seem sleepless.</p>
<p>During the opening night of the sixteenth, all government agencies hung national flags to celebrate. The working hours of all personnel were extended by one hour in the morning and the afternoon was given off, so that they could bring their families to visit the various exhibits. It is called a carnival, but it actually implies the intention of promoting industry and commerce.</p>
<p>In addition to the special program performances in the grand auditorium every night, it can be divided into five parts. (1) Exhibits of local products from various states and provinces (both raw and cooked goods). (2) Exhibits from government agencies (products from prisons, and the most from science museums and agricultural and forestry bureaus). (3) Exhibits from merchants (containing advertising properties). (4) Variety show performances (separate tickets must be purchased, such as hairy people, fat women, and Jianghu street performers). (5) Amusement park (roller coasters, flying boat models, free cars, etc.). Compared to the West Lake Expo in my country last year, there is really a big difference. However, it continues year after year, and the people regard it as a festival. The government does not have to subsidize it, and the company has a surplus every year. (The association is a company). Therefore, it can last and be promoted in various states and provinces.</p>
<p>There were five large parades during the opening period. All were held at 3 p.m. (1) Carnival parade. All walks of life can join. (2) School parade. Almost all public primary and secondary schools joined. (3) Military parade. (4) Flower Queen parade. (5) Float parade. There are judges for each time. Those who rank first, second, and third can win prizes. And large commercial companies that join the parade with floats all have advertising properties.</p>
<p>The right to elect the Flower Queen (that is, the Philippine lady) originally belonged to the newspapers for the preliminary selection and to the shareholders for the re-election. This year, the procedure has been changed. The association appointed five judges to first select the candidates who had been preliminarily selected by the newspapers (more than twenty people in total). After two selections, only five people remained. The judges, for the sake of prudence, ordered the five people to wear swimsuits and walk around the hall for several weeks, so that their curved beauty could be fully revealed, so as to determine their merits. Unexpectedly, some of the beauties were unwilling to lightly reveal their charms. Hearing this instruction, they all lost color. However, in order to seek the vanity of the night of the sixteenth, they did not dare not obey the orders of these judges who held all the power. Therefore, when going out, they were all shy and dared not make level glances. Some had tears streaming down their faces like rain. Ms. Vtoeta Pez originally had hopes of being elected, but she refused to take off her clothes and voluntarily gave up her right to be elected. Afterwards, the Heavenly King Church group published a letter in the newspaper praising her. Various newspapers also competed to publish her jade photos, and they were placed side by side with the elected Flower Queen. The reward of spiritual pleasure is truly more honorable than being selected.</p>
<p>The night of the coronation of the Flower Queen has always created a historical story, which is used as a performance. What was performed this year was a country of Eastern Muslim. The old Sultan wanted to pass the throne to his single daughter, the princess (the Flower Queen). The condition was that she must marry one of the princes of the most extravagant country. Therefore, at the opening ceremony, the grand ceremonial officer announced that princes from all countries were invited to the hall to propose marriage. The first to enter the hall was the Chinese prince, followed by the Indian prince, the Arabian prince, the Philippine Sultan's prince, the Spanish prince Isabiro, and finally the princess expressed her satisfaction with the marriage proposals from all countries. However, because she was loyal to her country's habits, she chose the same Philippine Sultan's prince as her lifelong companion. Afterwards, she was crowned Flower Queen by her father. After the ceremony, she went down the hall and rejoiced with the people. When the princes from various countries entered the hall to propose marriage, they were followed by forty attendants, each wearing their country's costumes and performing their country's dances. Those who decorated China were all wearing long robes with braids. Their dance was just a chaotic jump. From the perspective of Chinese people, it is really unknown from which dynasty it came from.</p>
<p>Among the various performances in the Chinese Assembly Hall, the most interesting was Children's Day. Purchasing a ticket could bring two children aged eight to twelve. Group performances could be registered in advance to avoid paying admission fees. The No. 1 Chinese Girls' School joined in performing the Grape Fairy Dance, which was greatly welcomed by the audience and won the second prize.</p>
<p>If you encounter an unfamiliar woman in the exhibition grounds, you can sprinkle paper flowers on her head to ask for information. American women may even nod and thank you. When encountering American soldiers playing in the venue and laughing, they would jokingly stuff their mouths with paper flowers, and they would laugh it off. This custom has recently diminished slightly. However, some unregulated youth among our overseas Chinese constantly throw paper flowers at women, trying to destroy their beauty. This kind of rude behavior is greatly despised by Filipinos.</p>
<p>The annual meeting of provincial governors, the finals of the Far East Games, and the Chinese Assembly are held during this period. This year, there are two special conferences. One is the Great Aphid Eradication Conference. Recently, willow trees suddenly produced a kind of locust, and the harvest was sharply reduced. Agriculture suffered a major blow. Agricultural experts from various provinces were gathered to discuss methods of killing insects. One is the Independence Congress, which is used to express the determination of the people to demand independence, so as to support the petition delegation. However, there is an interesting story about the Independence Congress. They also wanted to elect a Flower Queen to embellish it. The speaker said that the people of the Philippines hoped to build a truly republican and independent country in the future, and the election of a Flower Queen had aristocratic colors, which inevitably contradicted public opinion.</p>
<p>The current Flower Queen is a student at Holy Ghost College, a Catholic Saint School. The school authorities, according to Catholic practice, regarded the student's wearing a swimsuit for people to comment on in detail as a humiliation. Because the student was elected Flower Queen by wearing a swimsuit, it was considered to have damaged the school's dignity and reputation. The education community was divided into two factions. Moralists rose up in attack, believing that the association's move was a disgrace to women. Aesthetes said that every Sunday morning, there are large numbers of young women wearing swimsuits on the beach. It is not surprising that they are swimming in the sea. They also blamed the school authorities for being too narrow-minded. In the Philippines, which has been Europeanized for 300 years, the conflict between old and new perspectives is also inevitable. The problem of new and old morality is indeed difficult to unify in the world.</p>

<h3>Financial - Gold Market Lulls into Downtrend</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was very peaceful, with little trading activity. The price fluctuation for the entire day was only about 1.56 mace, with a lurking downward trend. Foreign exchange rates also remained unchanged. Industry sentiment was unusually mediocre. Although Wanxing and Shunli, among others, made some follow-up purchases, most sales were in small quantities. The market opened lower in the morning, mainly due to large silver bars being sold long. Afterwards, buyers persisted, slightly increasing the price by 1 liang, but then it fluctuated by a few qian, hovering around 98 liang. In the afternoon, selling exceeded buying, and the market weakened after an initial balance, falling from 98 liang to 96.5 liang. However, due to the Wednesday market closure, people felt uncertain.</p>
<p>▲The opening price in the morning dropped by 1 liang. Recent London silver bars have increased by 1/16, while forward rates remained unchanged. Silver prices increased by 3/8. The opening gold price for June was 497.1 liang, a decrease of 1 liang. The gross price gradually rose by 1 liang to 98.1 liang due to competitive buying. Exchange rates remained stable, and recent Dalian exchange rates were also bought at 1.04625 to 1.046875. This month's English gold was traded at 11 pence 25. When the quotation was revealed, it returned to 97.89 liang, with no change in the listed price. Internally, the price stabilized. Banks traded English gold for this month at 11 pence 25. An Da bought May Citibank for 49.25 yuan. Mitsui and others bought June English gold at 11 pence 375. However, due to small retail sales within the market, the price retreated by a few qian, reaching 97.23 liang at 10:00. Afterwards, it rebounded due to purchases by Yuan Maoyong, Hengxing, and others. Exchange rates remained stable, requiring 10 pence 25 for recent contracts and 375 for June. However, current Dalian was bought by Taiwan for 1.045625, and the gold price rose by 7-8 qian, reaching 98 liang at noon. Banks wanted to absorb spot goods, offering a price of 99 liang, but industry players had limited inventory. The market closed at noon at 97.9 liang, with the listed price remaining at 508.8 liang, a decrease of slightly less than 11 liang.</p>
<p>▲Afternoon Market Falls to 96.5 Liang The afternoon market opened at 97.8 liang, then 8 liang. Later, it was reported that Indian exchange rates were high, with over ten additional ounces. Supply exceeded demand on the surface, but there were no large transactions. Market sentiment weakened, and prices gradually declined, falling by more than 1 liang to 96.78 liang after 3:30. There were slight fluctuations. The foreign exchange market was inactive. Hengxing and others replenished their positions, and there were reports that Japanese banks were buying spot goods at a price of 98.5 liang, bringing the price to 97.23 liang at 4:00. Unexpectedly, long positions tended to sell off, reducing by about 2 liang in half an hour. The market closed at 96.5 liang at 4:30, a decrease of 1.6 liang compared to the 22nd. The highest price of the day was 498.1 liang, and the lowest price was 96.5 liang, a difference of 1.6 liang. The listed price decreased by slightly more than 12 liang.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Market is Ordinary and Lacks Distinctiveness</h3>
<p>▲Chinese Merchants Sell 1 Million Japanese Gold... Japanese Banks Absorb</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British, American, and Indian markets showed price increases, while the European market was peaceful. There were mutual transactions between China and India.

Over 100,000 yuan of American gold was sold, absorbed by An Da and Sumitomo. 1 million yuan of Japanese gold was sold, bought by Korea, Mitsui, and Taiwan.

<h3>Interest Rates Slightly Increase and Show a Buoyant Trend</h3>
<p>▲Market Overview The market was quiet due to the recent bank closures. When the banks reopened the day before yesterday, the situation was unusually busy. However, various news items could not be explored in detail and announced. Yesterday, the busy and idle periods had passed, and the market returned to normal. The current demand for foreign goods is mainly for tea and silk cocoons, which is still active. The silver market consistently sees long-term contracts expiring sequentially. The imbalance between busy and idle periods is understandable. However, silver credit remains tight, indicating that the silver market trend is unlikely to improve in the short term. Overall, it is currently the end of the third month of the lunar calendar. Due to habit, the busy period will not easily end soon.</p>
<p>▲Interest Rate Prices "Foreign Interest" opened at 7 qian 2 fen 1 li 8 hao 7 hu ban in the morning, similar to the previous day. In the afternoon, sentiment was strong, and prices gradually increased. The closing price was 7 qian 2 fen 2 li 1 hao 2 hu ban, an increase of 2 hao ban compared to the morning. "Silver Interest" fell back in both the morning and afternoon markets, dropping by half compared to the previous day, indicating that silver interest rates cannot recover in the short term due to tight silver credit. Head-of-account transactions were conducted without adding water. Banks holding licenses had no market price.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions Jiangnan small coins were priced at 6 qian 2 fen 7 li ban in both the morning and afternoon markets, a slight increase of half a li compared to the previous day. 2,000 jiao were traded in the morning, and there was no market in the afternoon. Guangdong small coins were priced at 5 qian 9 fen 9 li 7 hao ban in both markets. 125,000 jiao were traded in the morning, and 15,000 jiao in the afternoon. Due to strong buying interest, the price of copper coins continued to decrease by 1,000 wen to 389,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow "Silver Funds" Bank collection news yesterday indicated that the aftermath of the large collection had not subsided, so the collections were still substantial. Chinese merchants collected 2.7-2.8 million yuan in tickets, foreign merchants collected over 2.1 million yuan, loan advances were 1.5 million yuan, telegraphic transfer funds were over 500,000 yuan, silk export funds were over 800,000 yuan, various cargo exchange taxes and miscellaneous funds were 9.6-9.7 million yuan, warehouse withdrawals were 1.5 million yuan, Japanese banks were 3.8-3.9 million yuan, warehouse withdrawals were 500,000 yuan, money shops and silver public bills were over 26 million yuan, head-of-account funds were over 3.5 million yuan, various exchange funds were over 900,000 yuan, and cash collections were over 2 million yuan. "Six Funds" Early morning exchange ticket funds amounted to 1,365,000 yuan, and afternoon funds amounted to 800,500 yuan. There was no market for banknotes in the morning, and 10,000 yuan in the afternoon. Off-market banknotes were 147,000 yuan in the morning and 79,000 yuan in the afternoon. Cash dollars were 185,000 yuan in the morning and 113,000 yuan in the afternoon. New coins were 50,000 yuan in the morning and 25,000 yuan in the afternoon. Bank transactions amounted to 550,000 yuan in the morning and 650,000 yuan in the afternoon. Transactions between bank dollar accounts were over 1.4 million yuan, banknote inflows and outflows were 2.6-2.7 million yuan, money shop and public dollar bills were over 4.4 million yuan, dollar head-of-account funds were over 1.8 million yuan, and dollar loans were over 1.7 million yuan. Small firms traded over 800,000 yuan in banknotes, exchanges, cash dollars, and new coins.</p>
<h3>Another Large Batch of Long-Term Contracts Settled Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The amount of fixed-term funds (i.e., long-term deposits) expiring this month at money shops is substantial. Each period involves millions of yuan in inflows and outflows. The situations in previous periods have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Today, a large number of funds expiring yesterday (the 25th) are estimated to be no less than ten million yuan, requiring immediate negotiations. Therefore, deposits were already being made yesterday. However, most of these expiring funds are from old accounts, with little change. It is reported that Ningbo merchants have over three million yuan due, and 2.6-2.7 million yuan were transferred yesterday, with fixed interest rates ranging from 8.25 qian to 7.5 qian. These funds were absorbed by foreign firms, tea companies, and egg factories. As for silk and satin companies, fixed deposits were no more than 500,000-600,000 yuan, with interest rates at 9 liang. Of the funds expiring at Shanghai money shops and Chinese banks, over four million yuan were rolled over and renewed, over two million yuan were newly traded, and over one million yuan needed to be collected and settled.</p>
<h3>News of Tea and Silk Cocoon Dollar Uses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea dollar outflows continued to be over two million yuan, including Hangzhou shipping 300,000 yuan in banknotes and cash dollars, Guangdong shipping 500,000 yuan in new coins, Hankou shipping 600,000 yuan in cash dollars and banknotes, Anhui shipping 200,000 yuan in cash dollars, Fujian shipping 200,000 yuan in cash dollars, Ningbo shipping 100,000 yuan, and the interior shipping 150,000 yuan. Tea companies also bought over two million yuan, preparing to ship the next day. As for silk cocoon merchants, they spared no effort in seeking term dollars. Over one million yuan was fixed by the financial community yesterday, with interest rates ranging from 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 2 hao ban to 4 li ban. Silk cocoon companies also fixed over two million yuan in spot dollars, deposited in bank dollar accounts for immediate use. Currently, the use of dollar funds is busy, so interest rates are buoyant. Industry insiders predict that silk cocoon merchants will make large purchases in the coming days, which will improve the situation further.</p>
<h3>Securities - Flat Trading, Bond Market Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The morning session's 96 spot opened at 164, closed at 163.5, with 150,000 sold. The entire June 4-month contract was 71.85, with 5,000 sold.

<h3>Bond Market Unanimously Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>▲Trading is Not Active... Changes are Slight</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market remained calm. The total value of futures contracts traded was over 5.8 million yuan, including 1.82 million yuan of customs bonds, 850,000 yuan each of rehabilitation and disbandment bonds, and 650,000 yuan each of continued rolling six bonds and consolidated June bonds. Other bonds, such as continued two-five, military reduction, finance, and 96 and 97 bonds, were even more scarce. Only 24,000 yuan of spot goods were traded. As for the changes in each bond, except for a slight drop in consolidated six bonds, the others all rose slightly due to increased buying interest, with an estimated increase of 2-3 jiao to 6-7 jiao.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Yarn Sales Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>▲ 3,000 Bales of 20-Count Blue Phoenix Yarn Opened by Japanese Factories</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm and stable. Overseas cotton markets are frequently reporting declines, but the local market sentiment is still good. Buyers are unwilling to let go. Large short positions intend to deliver significant amounts, but the transaction volume is too large. Retailers with no stock have to cover their positions as the deadline approaches. As a result, the market slightly rises. In reality, the yarn market does not have a large upward trend. However, the lower base allows buyers to feel more at ease. There are no significant changes in the short term. Only three days remain for settlements this month, and the transaction volume is as high as 29,850 bales. It remains to be seen whether it will pass quietly.</p>
<p>▲ Recent Yarn抵空Stays Firm The opening price of the Renbiao Market was mediocre. One manufacturer is still holding firm on its position for this month, and retailers are short. No. 66 yarn has begun to抵空, stabilizing the market. Trading is not active. The current month is up 5 qian, and the distant month is up 1-2 qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that actual sales were good, and 3rd-grade yarn rebounded by 1-2 yuan. No. 66 yarn is still抵進 near-month contracts, rising another 1 qian, while the distant month fell by 1.3 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 9,100 bales. The closing prices of the Renbiao Market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Renbiao Closing Price Change Stored Account Closing Price Change Stored Account April 1534 Up 29,850 July 1527 Down 1 26,000</p>
<p>May 1523 2 41,000 August 1529 1 20,450</p>
<p>June 1527 2 33,200 September 1535 Up 1 8,650</p>
<p>▲ 6,000 Bales of Spot Yarn Opened Sales are excellent, with various merchant groups buying over 3,100 bales. Industry peers and foreign firms are buying 3,850 bales of Japanese yarn. The market is flat. Among the merchant groups, Jinan is the largest buyer, with 730 bales. In addition, Shantou bought 175 bales, Dandong bought 150 bales, Jiangxi bought 100 bales, Wuhu bought 40 bales, Xiamen bought 55 bales, Niuzhuang bought 145 bales, the interior bought 290 bales, Sichuan bought 75 bales, Luzhou bought 10 bales, Southeast Asia bought 160 bales, Tianjin bought 55 bales, and miscellaneous merchants bought 55 bales. Japanese factories opened 3,000 bales of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn, which were taken up by foreign firms.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Suddenly Turns Weak</h3>
<p>▲ Overseas Cotton Telegrams Frequently Report Declines Long Positions Take Profits</p>
<p>The cotton market has weakened due to continuous declines in overseas cotton markets for several days. Long positions are closing, and there are reports that American cotton deliveries are being rejected. There is a deep concern that foreign cotton may continue to fall. Those who have made profits are taking the opportunity to sell and close their positions. Market sentiment is therefore weak. Japanese firms have also slightly released positions this month. The spot business on the market is quiet. The attitude of various factories is unusually calm.</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Futures Fall Back 2.5 Qian The opening price of the Hanbiao Market was relatively firm. Retailers are covering their short positions, with a decline of only 0.05-0.1 qian. In the afternoon, those who made profits are closing their positions, and the market suddenly became weak. Each month fell by 1.5-2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 34,500 dan. The closing prices of the Hanbiao Market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hanbiao Closing Price Change Stored Account 635 5 Down 25 71,800</p>
<p>4 3620 Down 25 47,900 73520 25 66,000</p>
<p>5 3541 Down 25 81,000 83520 25 54,300</p>
<p>▲ Spot Cotton Demand is Scarce The spot cotton market is showing signs of wavering following the external markets. Actual demand is quiet. Market sentiment is languid, exhibiting a relaxed atmosphere. The amount of cotton arriving at the docks includes over 300 bales of Tonghua cotton and 100 bales of Yaohua cotton. The sales records are listed below:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 37.40 Purchased by Puyi Factory 100 pieces Spot delivery to factory</p>
<p>Hefei Cotton 34.00 Purchased by Yongyu Factory 156 bales Spot delivery to warehouse</p>
<h3>American Cotton Diverges from Three Commodities</h3>
<p>▲ American Cotton Long Positions Take Profits, Continuing Weakness Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to the possibility of large-scale deliveries and long positions taking profits. Later, it strengthened due to a lack of rain in the drought-stricken areas. Futures fell by 3-13 points, and spot fell by 15 points. British cotton futures fell by 15 points, and spot fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 10 points. Indian cotton initially followed American cotton with a small decline, but later strengthened due to purchases by European exporters. Pingguoer fell by 3 rupees, and the distant month fell by 2 rupees. Aomula fell by 4 rupees, and Yuanming fell by 3 rupees. Bairoxi fell by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram dated the 22nd):</p>

<h3>Food - Heshia Rice Market Stagnant and Weak</h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei Yesterday, there were over 20 suppliers from various routes, but sales were sluggish. There was little pre-sale of Beigeng rice, with no ups and downs. The onward route to Zhongguan was very stagnant, and stores were also inactive. The market was slight. The price of old stock was down 2 jiao. Currently, the goods accumulated in the river cannot be held any longer, so the rice market is unlikely to flourish. The stores on the street selling Bo Dao also had weak demand, with little buying interest. Prices became stagnant and soft. The foot price of Yang Du Zi Xian remained stable, but buyers had stockpiles of foreign rice, so there was no buying interest. Saigon small grain suddenly fell at noon, and the situation was very poor. Sanxian also weakened. Bai Yuan's sales were quiet, with few transactions. Prices remained weak.</p>
<p>▲ Hunan There were 6-7 shipments of Heshia goods, and sales were stagnant. The situation in Suxi and other areas was more harmonious than in the northern market, as the inventories of domestic machine-milled rice were low. The overall market was stable. It was difficult for prices in this area to rise or fall. Therefore, although the Zhabei market has been soft for several days, this market remained stagnant and flat. However, trading and foot prices were very low. The early morning market for Nanbang Bo Dao Xing Early and Late Rice was still stable, but it later became sluggish, and prices were also said to have been cut. The sales of the Yang Du tip were slightly connected, but only retail inquiries were made. The situation remained firm. Tongbian's sales to Yin Yuan customers were mediocre. Arrivals were also scarce. Although the market was stable, it lacked vitality.</p>
<h3>The Main Reason for the Decline in Flour Prices</h3>
<p>▲ Old Flour... Manufacturers Relax... Actual Sales Unwilling to Buy</p>
<p>▲ New Flour... Excellent Weather... Long Positions Gradually Returning</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market unanimously declined. Recently, actual sales have been unwilling to buy, and one factory has also slightly relaxed. Market sentiment is not as firm as before because, for old goods, apart from actual sales, few speculators have the ability to take delivery of spot goods. As for the distant months, the weather remains excellent, and selling interest has increased. The price of new flour is not only higher than in previous years but is also rarely seen in history. From a factual standpoint, there is no basis for whether the wheat harvest will be good or bad. Due to the price of rice, the wheat price is being artificially inflated. The quality of the wheat itself is being disregarded. The speculative nature of this is becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, due to the good weather, the factory's long positions are gradually returning, and the new flour prices are getting a chance to fall. As a result, this month's price is down 0.75 li compared to the previous day. The prices for May to July are down 1.5 fen, and the prices for August and September are down 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Futures and Spot are Both Weak</h3>
<p>▲ Over 7,000 Bags of Spot Wheat Opened... High-Quality Goods Shortened by 3-4 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures both weakened. In the current month, as delivery is approaching, long positions are gradually returning. Those who are actually delivering the goods heard that Taikang needs to take away over 40 trucks. In the distant months, the weather is very good, and wheat seedlings are reported to be abundant. The prices of foreign wheat are also 2-3 jiao lower. Therefore, Suzhou, Changzhou, and the northern Jiangsu area are selling heavily. However, most of the Wuxi merchants are still artificially inflating the price, but the environment is such that they are ultimately weakening. As a result, this month is down 2 fen compared to the previous day, June is down 3 fen, July is down 2 fen, August is down 3 fen, and September is down 2 fen. Spot wheat is also showing signs of fatigue. Only the large factories have sales, and the small and medium-sized factories are inactive. The asking price for high-quality goods is also 3-4 fen lower. Over 7,000 bags of Suzhou wheat, Qingjiangpu wheat, Bengbu wheat, and Xuzhou wheat were opened at 5.05 liang, and they were handled by Fuxin and Fufeng.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - European and American Silk Sales are Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market in Shanghai turned quiet because overseas silk mills are focusing on artificial silk when weaving thin silk. As a result, the sales of natural silk have decreased. Silk telegrams are rarely sent to Shanghai, and the market is weary. Zollin and others shipped 40 bales of Shanghai white silk. Dachang shipped 20 bales of Sichuan yellow silk. Prices are unlikely to improve.</p>
<h3>New Green Tea from Suian Begins to be Weighed</h3>
<p>Suian green tea, since the Qingming Festival, has developed unusually quickly due to sunny and warm weather. From the 18th onwards, mountain households have successively started picking tea. The tea leaves are still tender, and Shanghai local tea factories have sent people with funds to the mountains to purchase them. Additionally, local firms are competing to buy, making the market quite lively. It is now heard that the weighing has been decided, with a price of 56 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). However, current trends indicate strong buying interest, and prices may rise.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Zhejiang Sales Particularly Strong Before Tax Increase</h3>
<p>▲ Cotton Cloth from Our Factory: The market for all goods is gradually declining, with both fine and coarse cloth also sluggish. This is due to slow sales and increasing inventory. With the end of April approaching, holders of goods are seeking to sell them off. Therefore, yesterday, fine cloth saw a slight decrease of two and a half cents, while coarse cloth experienced more drops than rises. Fine twill from Guangdong, Shantou, and other regions has uniformly stopped. However, due to the tax increase in the Zhejiang region, over 500 more pieces were sold. Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, Hangzhou, and other ports are actively purchasing, especially coarse cloth. Over 200 pieces of 14-pound "Horse Feed," 16-pound "Five Cranes," and 13-pound "Double Lodge" were shipped. Fine cloth and fine twill were also quite popular, showing a slight sign of excitement in various regions.</p>
<p>▲ Miscellaneous Textiles: Yesterday's market was unusually chaotic, with actual sales only active in the Zhejiang region. Eastern goods such as "Civilization" and colored ting continued to drop by two and a half cents, printed cloth by five cents, deep-colored goods selling for 4 taels and 5 fen, and white cloth for 4 taels to 3 taels and 9 qian and 5 fen. After frequent drops, raw cotton yarn suddenly became scarce yesterday, causing a rebound. "Dian Qiuxiang" reopened at 8 taels and 4 qian in the afternoon, with "Tang Taizong" selling out at 8 taels and 2 qian and 5 fen. Various Zhejiang regions purchased over 100 pieces. The order and transaction of "Zhongbing" velvet have been very active in recent days, with over 1,000 pieces done among the industry, mostly at 1 qian, 7 fen, and 7 li and 5 hao. The quoted price for "Hua Zhigong" flannel and fine broadcloth is much higher than the spot price, so not many orders were placed. Western goods such as bald blue and gray plain silk fabrics are most popular, with "Fengyu Yibenwanli" opening at 5 qian and 7 fen and 5 hao, and "Dafugui" at 6 qian, both rising by two and a half cents compared to miscellaneous colors, mostly purchased by Hangzhou traders.</p>
<h3>Grain Market: Coarse and Refined White Sugar Transactions Even More Desolate</h3>
<p>▲ Due to Fines for Exporting Machine-Ground Refined White Sugar</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market report from the production area stated that the current sugar price in Cuba is still 1.65625, the New York futures price for May is 1.58, down two points from the previous report, September is 1.71, down three points, December is 1.82, down two points, and the price for March next year is 1.88, also down three points. The current sugar price in Java is 10.25, the futures price for May is 10.375, and the price for June is 10.50, all down by 121 points from the previous report. The association market's trading panel showed that the transaction price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sugar remained at 7 taels, 2 qian, and 7 fen and 5 hao, with high-quality sugar at 7 taels and 3 qian. The market generally appeared weak, and transactions were not smooth. This is because bulk sugar is usually ground by machine to meet the needs of various places. Recently, shipments from certain firms to Hankou and other places via ships have been detained and fined by the local customs under various pretexts, requiring the payment of the usual half-tax. Therefore, sugar merchants have suddenly become panicked and mostly prefer to stop machine grinding and observe the future intentions. Consequently, the market is even more desolate with fewer transactions. No. 20 medium white sugar traded quietly at 7 taels and 5 fen. The Japanese sugar market also appeared soft, with Z mark at 7 taels and 7 qian, YT mark at 7 taels and 6 qian, YP mark at 7 taels, 7 qian, and 7 fen and 5 hao, and YRO mark at 7 taels and 3 qian, transactions were also in decline, and the market situation was very quiet.</p>

Then the two armies started fighting. Only a roar was heard, as if the mountains were collapsing and the ground was cracking, and these hundreds of warriors rushed to kill the enemy in the smoky mist.

<h3>1930s East Palace · Hui · Yin</h3>
<p>1930 is a beautiful year. The focus of a woman's beauty is from the head, to the chest, and down to the feet.</p>
<p>Our East Palace is the residence of the most famous palace masters in Shanghai's universities. At this time, we will talk about the recent developments of this East Palace. Who can't pay attention to it?</p>
<p>▲ The Decayed Reception Room: The fame of the East Palace is mostly due to the beauty of the female students. Because of the beauty of the female students, male students have to rush to the reception room every day. Therefore, the reception room has become magnificent and bizarre. At that time, the East Palace was newly built, and there was also a female student instructor position. The task of this female student instructor was of course a remote position similar to that of a dormitory supervisor. But because the female students in the East Palace were very smart, no one else needed to guide them in anything. They were certainly good at finding lovers by themselves. So the instructor had nothing to do, so she devoted herself to arranging the reception room, making it extremely magnificent. Unfortunately, the instructor was finally expelled by all the female students for not allowing the female students to meet guests at night, and the reception room also declined because of this. The springs on the soft sofa were loosened, the elegant dressing mirror was broken, the white curtains were dirty... everything was declining. How can the palace masters sitting inside be happy? In a word, the reception room is declining, so male and female students no longer use it as a place to talk about love, and it is occupied by a group of attentive female students as a classroom. Whenever it is time for self-study at night, no longer hear pleasant laughter and joyous soft words in the reception room, but only a silent atmosphere covers it.</p>
<p>▲ New Beautiful Female Students: There were originally many beautiful female students in the East Palace, and this semester several famous girls have been transferred from other places. Some are queens from Tsinghua (the queen of Shui Mu Tsinghua), some are stars from Jin University, and some are social butterflies from Waseda University. It is really a palace full of talents. Therefore, the old female students have been overshadowed, the old demeanor has changed, and even the original queen has had to abdicate to make way for the virtuous. Changed, the entire East Palace has been changed by these three or four girls. The queen of Tsinghua is surnamed Song, and she has a slender posture and attractive face. She also played an important role in Hong Shen's "Cyrano de Bergerac". The star of Jin University is surnamed Zhang, she has a plump physique, a heavy attitude, and she also works very hard. She is often seen in the newly built library. The social butterfly of Zhongda is surnamed Luo, she has revolutionary enthusiasm, lively and innocent naiveté, and she also has the genius of Wen'an and fiery enthusiasm. Her works can often be read in the supplements of major newspapers in Shanghai - those works full of rich emotions and obvious consciousness. Think about it, this kind of thing has happened. In order to read her works in the newspaper, many male students wrote letters to her asking to be friends, and some even sent their drafts of speeches to the East Palace for her to revise.</p>
<h3>India Implements Child Marriage Ban</h3>
<p>Bombay News: The law banning child marriage throughout India will be implemented in April of this year. After that, the British authorities will inevitably have more difficulties in addition to Gandhi's non-cooperation movement. After the Legislative Council promulgated the law in September last year that children under the age of fourteen are not allowed to marry, people from all over the country rose up in opposition. The most intense opposition came from orthodox Brahmins, who claimed that this law would destroy the foundations of Indian society and make Indian women old women before they got married. However, the supporters said that this law was purely to increase the status of Indian women. According to statistics in 1921, there were a total of 250,000 Indian women under the age of five who were married or widowed, 2 million under the age of ten, and 40% of women aged 10 to 15 were married. According to the Marriage Law of 1892, children under the age of twelve must not marry. In 1924, the Legislative Council changed the age limit to thirteen. However, few Brahmins followed it. This campaign to ban child marriage started at the All India Women's Conference. Many intellectual Indian women shouted loudly to increase the status of women, and many people expressed sympathy. The result was the new law of September last year. It is heard that the All India Women's Conference, having won on this point, will further strive for women's inheritance rights and the abolition of polygamy.</p>
