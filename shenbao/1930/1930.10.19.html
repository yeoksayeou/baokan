<p>救濟失業爲全世界今日最要問題。故各國皆有救濟失業之提議。即就英國一國而論。工黨政府。有工黨政府之主張。保守黨又有保守黨之主張。自由黨又有自由黨之主張。據自由黨領袖在大會演說。言及自由黨與工黨關於失業問題之談話。謂自由黨之主張。政府宜召集代表各工商業資本家及工會銀行之大會。以提出减輕出產成本而不礙及工人生活爲標準。俾可增高英國產業之效率與競爭。政府亦宜積極縮减支出。對於請求津貼及養老金與家屬津貼。大爲反對。並主張國家募債。以辦理公共工程。</p>
<p>要之救濟失業。是以能使失業者得有工作爲第一要義。而其所使之工作决不能與現方競爭過度。致有妨商業之工作相連。故無論何國大抵皆以辦理公共工程。爲共同之一點。因公共工程。旣能容納多少失業之人。而又不致與其他貨物之工業之競爭也。特以國家之財力有限。公共工程亦不能無限耳。</p>

<p>到了後來、他們的副領隊余巨賢君、發表了南華不準其球員參加的三種原因、他說（一）組織不公開、（二）球員接洽手續不大妥當、（三）經濟不富充、這三種理解、看來似乎很確切、但在我看來、統是搪塞之詞罷、第一、他說我們組織不公開、我說我們組織是過於公開、而我們的弊病、就是在於過於公開的緣故、因爲如果我們始終如一的用着樂華的名義、單用樂華的實力去對付、雖然名稱太狹和勢力較弱、但我們不靠外方、定卜一帆風順、可告無阻無碍、如果余君說公開的意義、是要把那件事推出來給三華會一同辦理才行、那我更覺得是爲害尤烈、結果更不堪設想了、因爲我素來知到港中兩華會是冰炭不相容的、平時港中遇着選隊對外的當兒、爲着出席多寡的人數問題竟起了不少的無謂爭執、小事已如此、像遠征這樣、正不知吵鬧到若何田地呢、第二、他說球員接洽上手續不妥善、我們是循着前例做去的、我記得澳行那時連通告書也没有一通、球員雖然是隸屬於一會、但如果伊們是業餘運動家、伊們便有自由權、會内是不能控制和管轄的、營業式的手續、是侵佔業餘球員的權限和污穢伊們的人格之一種步驟、又何况從前南華也曾請樂華的周陳戴李四君帮過他的忙、但始終未有口頭上或文字上的通告和酌商、樂華的手續如果不正當、南華的手續更不堪聞問了余君啊、事實昭昭、想你不會忘記了罷、第三、他說樂華經濟不充裕、那更是無稽之談了、我們的經濟情形、余君乂怎樣洞悉到敢下斷語呢、像我上頭說過、我們的費用、預算是和保證金足以相抵着、還有不虞之需、我們也很留意地預備着又豈有毫無頭緒　挺而走險的道理、余君過於以杞人自居了、算了罷、自作自知我希望以後大家能以誠相見、不要造詞來掩飾、因爲掩飾祗在一時、到底無補於事、</p>
<p>很多人們很疑惑地找尋下面的兩種答案、（一）爲甚麽港會不贊同呢、（二）爲甚麽兩華會不肯合作呢、其中實情、我雖則不敢斷定、但我却忖測得十之八九、港會每年的收入是全靠着華隊的、假使華隊的好手去了、一定影響到他的經濟地位、最近他判决不許曹等參加入的手段、是取一勞永逸、禁止以後華人不敢再試的宗旨、至於兩華會呢、是要顧全本身的實力、所以才多方設法阻止他各個的球員參加、外此還有彼此猜忌、也是一種很大的緣因、</p>
<p>我以爲兩華會的宗旨是大錯特錯、因爲如果你想你的勢力雄厚、正好派幾人出外採取較優的智識、終日在港角逐、進步是很遲緩的、澳行兩次便足引證了、至於球員個人、除了事實上的確不能辦到外、無論如何、也值得隨軍一行的、那幾位應允在先反約在後的球員、我雖然很諒解他們的地位、但我總以爲身爲業餘球員、而自己放棄本人的自由權利、受着一會的束縛、是很可惜而愚蒙的一件事、</p>
<p>末了我在收筆的先、還想向徐振東君作很簡單的解釋、徐君爲這次的遠征的事、是費了無限的心思、他的公平心和熱烈意我是很感佩的、不過、他所發表的、謬誤之處很多、事實離題太遠、他說這次港方球員、都因着不滿意手續而不參加、我是主動者之一、所以當較詳盡、其實港方球員、除了祗有一位因爲要求過苛、越乎業餘常例故未接洽外、其餘統皆親口應承、準備參加、過不後來一半受着會内的控制、半受着破壞者的煽動、所以才臨岐反約罷了、致於徐君所云經濟不充、全靠着爪哇來籌所需的欵項、那更屬忘測之詞了、我上文所講過的事實、旣足代我辯白、我恕不再重贅了、我們兩次在南洋都無發起捐欵、而此番在爪哇成績較遜、也並未受僑界的責難、雖然其間有博負者一時之忿地微有怨言、但大體上深知我們的苦衷而加以原諒的、十佔八九、徐君又說、我們去後、後方和上海總會交涉的竟無一人、不知徐君何所知而云然、我在離申前曾親託江道章王復旦吳邦偉、三君組織樂華乙隊、照常參加、不過後來因着遠征擱淺、我們重返滬濱、他們才放下不幹、總之、徐君的消息是和事實完全背道而馳、爲免外界誤會、和淆亂觀聽起見、我很希望徐君以後說話要查眞一點、此後徐君還有甚麽不明瞭的地方、我也很樂意的詳細解釋、</p>
<p>最後中國人的是非、祗好在中國人裏面弄個明白、在英文報上還是少提一點好、因爲在英文報上而作關於國人事件的文字辯論、是非吾人所樂觀樂爲的、（完）</p>

<p>▲海軍建設　至我國海軍本極幼稚、萬不足與歐美日本比擬、即就將來我國海軍建設而言、决非局部問題、非俟全國政治經濟等各事平均發展、不易爲功、蓋海軍建設、需欵浩大、决非數百千萬元購備數艦所能了事、故倘財政無充分把握、有陸續不絶之來源、則挖肉補瘡、寗濟於事、故首宜政治昌明、然後財政富裕、方能言眞正海軍之建設也、中國海軍建設、就目下情狀而言、苟茲後能前進勿退、則再有十年方能大成、現已聘定英日海軍敎官數名來華、發展海軍敎育、</p>
<p>▲整理報告　杜氏又謂、余以此次考察所得、擬就報告書一大册、由董顯光君編制整理、約二三月後可以印刷就緒、公佈於世、關於目下整頓中國海軍意見、余分爲上中下三策、謹備國府採納、陳紹寛次長、因參與公祭譚院長禮、約今晚由京來滬、余俟與之晤談後、即日晋京、謁見蔣主席、報告一切經過、杜氏談鋒頗銳、滔滔不絶、對於民衆體育之提倡、尤爲注意、今茲所紀、特其什一耳、</p>
<p>▲聯歡茶會　昨日下午三時半、本埠海軍界及旅滬閩省各聞人·及杜氏親屬等百餘人、假座馬霍路海軍聯歡社、開盛大茶會歡迎、首由甘聯敖少將、代表李鼎新上將主席、致歡迎詞、略謂、杜上將去年奉國府命、派往日本及歐美各國、考察海軍情形及航空事宜、出國以來、已届一載、此次由歐歸來、考察所得、於吾國海軍界將來定有莫大之貢獻云云、</p>
<p>▲答詞大意　繼由杜氏答詞、略云、兄弟自去年十月間奉國府命令派往日本歐美各國、考察海軍、蒙諸君歡送、今日返國時、又承在席諸君歡迎、實深感激、並謝諸君盛意、兄弟歷經日本及歐美各國、考察所得者、已由董秘書顯光等編輯成册、今日僅就考察所得之感想、特向諸君報告、兄弟前在歐洲學習海軍、五年畢業、尙能得到相當之成績、現在科學昌明、研究學術日、益繁難、各國學生進海軍學校、均須中學畢業後、經多年之專攻工夫、方能窺其門徑、有大學畢業及將領學校畢業者、亦多投入海軍、深資造就、故人才輩出、吾國年來内亂不息、政府無暇顧及海軍、言之至堪惋惜、現在若要整頓海軍、第一須籌足經費、二須培養人才、人才經濟、不可偏廢、目前政府雖曾派有海軍員生往各國留學、但爲數甚鮮、即學成回國、亦難爲力、故兄弟主張、甚望政府當局、多設海軍學校、羅致海軍專門人才、聘請國外敎授、逐步進行、將來方能得到良好之成績、總之、國家不宜完全依靠軍備、即有極有力而極雄厚之海陸軍、倘各方意見分歧、力量即因而减薄、各種事業之失敗、亦均因自私自利所致、海陸軍中人、祇知有本身利益、不知有國家之海陸軍、故海陸軍之力量、祗見分散衰落、不能集中强健、國人器量均太狹、嫉忌心過重、其結果各事均遭失敗、故言建設、第一步在改造民衆自私自利之心理、能大多數顧全公衆之利益、然後合羣合力、建設新中國、初不僅海軍一端之發展而已也云云、至五時許、攝影盡歡而散、</p>

<p>鄞縣周湘雲之子昌善、居住牛莊路二十七號、昨晨六時一刻許、忽在江灣體育會西路被匪綁去、其自用汽車、遭匪擊壞輪胎、出事後、約兩時該管市公安局五區五所始得此耗、派探查緝、尙無所獲、</p>
<p>▲中途被綁　周昌善、喜騎馬、在江灣跑馬塲蓄馬數匹、每晨有暇、輒往騎駛、昨晨周邀居住狄思威路七十四號之騎師哇查利屋同往江灣、由車夫陳阿明駕八三三四號汽車載往、駛至體育會西路合昌油廠北首、忽有汽車一輛、横在道中、攔住去路、周車即停止前進、顧前車實係綁匪所駕、突有男子五人下車、三人執有手槍、將周及車夫陳阿明從車廂拖下、架上匪車、</p>
<p>▲匪徒開槍　匪於綁架周昌善時、開槍兩響、將周車之輪船擊壞、一面用糊紙之眼鏡戴在主僕二人面上、然後向江灣方面絶馳而去、至持志大學附近、匪停車將車夫驅下、臨行並給信一封、帶交周之家屬、内稱周某現在本埠、儘請放心、至與周同車之西人哇查利屋、則枯待十數分鐘後、始見車夫陳阿明奔回原處、將車胎調換、然後開回上海而來、</p>

<p>▲失業已久絶無收入</p>
<p>▲全家老幼何以爲生</p>
<p>▲不得已而出此下策</p>
<p>本埠自湘人衛延殘因受環境壓迫闔家投浦自殺案發生後、頗引起社會人士之注意、詎前晚八時三十分、閘北寳山路又發生一青年開槍自殺案、其原因與衛如出一轍、死者爲本埠滬北區保衛團第三隊團員江西人游家祥、情極悽愴、茲將經過詳情縷述於次、</p>
<p>▲家庭情况　游團員、年三十八歲、原籍江西、寓滬有年、父母早逝、現家中共有一庶母、髮妻石氏、年三十一歲、子女凡三、長女名家珍、十二歲、長男關龍、八歲、幼女名三媛、方週歲、闔宅同居於閘北青雲路恒裕里四弄五十號門牌、</p>
<p>▲失業經過　游君爲金陵大學校友、性極高傲、而人極和藹、富於進取心、一度在仁德洋行充報關員、繼入大昌商行仍任報關職、作事幹練、素爲朋儕等所稱許、嗣大昌因營業不振、宣告停業、於是君亦隨之而成一失業者、直至去歲春間、始由友人介紹入閘北寳山路寳善里一號前上海寳山縣保衛團第一團第四隊、即現在改組爲上海滬北區保衛團第三隊爲事務員、</p>
<p>▲生活困苦　游君失業、迄已年餘、一家數口、生活有增無減、收入毫無憑藉、而保衛團團員一職、乃係完全義務、匪獨分文毫無、且一切車馬費、亦須出諸自已、於是捉襟見肘、勢難維持、受刺日深、遂萌自殺之念、一種消極態度、時露言表、雖迭經友人喻勸、但游君已早具一死之心矣、</p>
<p>▲曾擬自戕　本年舊歷八月十三晚游家祥死後慘狀</p>
<p>間九時許、在家與妻促膝閒話、談至悲痛處、游忽拔出手槍、擬欲自戕、當時幸其妻手快、力將手槍奪下、一面奔告其同隊契友卜禮鑅君（游至該隊充任隊員即卜君所介紹者）、向其力勸、游惟俯首不語、似已稍稍覺悟、</p>
<p>▲果然慘死　前晚七時半、游忽一人到隊、逕至樓上過街樓房間内閱報時、隊中所有人員、均已離隊、祗樓下披間内留有一人守户、至八時一刻、忽聞樓上發生槍聲一響、心知有異、立即登樓視察、祗見游端坐於椅上、頭向左側、右手持左輪手槍一支、胸前左乳旁鮮血直流、知係自殺、乃飛報隊長莫悔卿及副隊長朱礎成、立即召集全體團員計議、</p>
<p>▲卡片兩紙　並由莫隊長報告隔壁五區總署及通知游之家屬、五區游區長親往查勘一過、飭傳地保報院請騐、並在閱報檯上發現游君本人卡片兩張、一致其妻、上寫「賢妻如面、苦度半世、實在對不起你、」一致團部同人、上寫「身後請代料理後事、家寒無力、團總隊長排長諸位同志、」</p>
<p>▲明日舉殯　昨日上午十一時三十分、法院特派檢察官到隊檢騐一過、檢得彈中左胸並未穿出、當即塡明屍格、旋於午後二時舉殯、並由隊中發出通告、原文錄下、「爲通告事、本隊事務員游家祥、於昨夜八時一刻、在隊部樓上用左輪手槍自殺、據其家屬云、實爲感現代社會之生活艱難及受環境經濟之壓迫而出此策等云、查該游事務員生前服務社會、非常熱心、對於本隊、尤爲勤奮、操防成績、素爲同儕所欽慕、現因感受經濟困逼之痛苦而至自殺、我同人等痛惜之餘、自行前來執紼送殯、聊盡同志之義、茲定於今日下午二時半、在本隊出殯、爲特通告各該員、全體武裝於下午二時正、集合隊部出發送殯爲要、特此通告」同時青雲路恒裕里弄口由鄰人王叔文·王圭璋·陸裕香趙耀武·等出一通告、忱惜游君因受經濟壓迫而自殺、請社會人士設法救濟游君家屬、詞極悽楚沉痛、但尙有一般人謂游用度甚闊、前後負債二千餘金、近因債權人之圍逼、故出此下策、但均屬神經過敏揣測之詞、蓋因君生前喜御洋服、致有是項誤傳、至於游之負債、事或有之、爲數亦不過百餘金云、</p>

<p>▲匪徒投函詐稱被綁</p>
<p>▲棺柩旁騙去二百元</p>
<p>年已七十七歲之金山張堰老人唐少如、因來滬營業、忽患隱疾、遂延醫診治、神經又遭錯亂、嗣於上月十六日下午七時三刻許、忽然失踪、曾經懸賞找尋等情、已紀前報、茲悉該老人失踪後、迄今已届匝月、仍杳無影跡、惟其鄉間家屬、已發生設計綁架被騙銀洋、其中經過、頗爲曲折有趣、爰將詳情探錄於下、</p>
<p>▲家庭中之狀况　唐老年雖已邁、而身體非常强健、家居張堰北街、開設唐泰記腌臘店爲業、並無資產、略可敷衍而已、家有一妻一子、妻年亦五十餘、子年僅十四歲、係老年得子、頗爲鍾愛、出入俱其、其對於店中批購貨物、悉係親往選辦、故須時常來滬、凡抵滬後、則必假居於法租界中之友人處、往來馬路、步履如飛、向不雇車趁坐、</p>
<p>▲頓受意外刺激　八月初旬、唐老因接洽營業事宜、由鄉來滬、仍居於友人寓中、一日傍晚、行經英法交界之愛多亞路、忽被雉妓强拉而去、詎竟頓染梅毒、當因强迫遭此隱疾、腦中驟受刺激、即於八月十一日由友介紹入院醫治、因之憂鬱在胸、神經變爲錯亂、後雖隱疾漸次醫愈、言語仍時露顚倒、本擬再緩數日、即須病愈返鄉、</p>
<p>▲失踪時之情狀　九月十六日下午七時三刻許、唐老因素喜嗜阿芙蓉膏、乃獨自由院而出、擬往某處吸食、不料中途忽告失踪、該院見其不返、料必返家、後由其家人到滬探望、方悉確爲失亡、當時唐老走出時、身上僅穿雙藍斜紋短夾襖、柳條布袴、白紗襪黑鞋、脫頭、髮已雪白、身畔祗有現洋二十二元、銀錶一隻、銅元數百枚、並無他物、曾經分投華洋各機關、請求偵緝在案、</p>
<p>▲得函悉已被綁　嗣經家屬方面、偵騎四出、杳無踪跡、家人正在焦急駭怪之際、忽於九月杪接得由滬寄鄉之一函、其中略稱唐老在滬、安好無恙、祗須備足大洋一千五百元、如數交付後、當將原人送還不誤、回信可以派人持滬、前往徐家匯火車站東邊、置於地上所遺之破鞋中等語、於是家屬方面、知已被綁勒贖、惟以姑念其年老免生危險起見、决定暫從接洽進行、</p>
<p>▲雙方接洽經過　當因人心險惡、恐係設計騙財、乃書一復函、要求對方須將唐老身上之物、寄回一件、以資證明、至欵額實無此力量、務須减縮、方克設法等語、派人遵址置放鞋内、逾數日、果又來一函、稱物件遞寄周折、即以唐老自云之渾名、「唐板櫈」三字爲證、乃其家屬以爲此渾名、外人罕有知之、遂信以爲眞、通函磋商欵項、至本月初旬、始得對方來函、說定備欵四百元、先付二百元、派人</p>

<p>持滬、送往徐家匯火車路北有一草亭内之棺柩旁邊破鞋内、餘二百元、准隔日再行通函約定地方或約日在租界中之中央旅館旁、人銀兩交、</p>
<p>▲果然失銀被騙　家屬因念其年老患疾、憂急盼望、理所當然、乃即備欵洋二百元派人持滬、遵址前往該處置放鞋内、翌日其家屬即引頸而望、來函約日、俾可交銀接人、不料迄今已將旬日、音訊杳然、方悟確爲設計被騙、惟其失踪已匝月、何仍生死莫名、其家屬焦急之狀、固非筆墨所能形容也、</p>

<p>▲里中一男一女　女子瞿新囡、年方十七、美丰姿、與阿母瞿翁氏合居於北京路浙江路口顧家弄七十六號、其入贅姊丈海榮、亦居是地、里中有高毓良者、年十九、翩翩濁世、素垂涎新囡貎美、本年廢歷二月間、新囡出外、遇高、遂與目成、</p>
<p>▲儼然一對伉儷　自此繾綣備至、三月後、新囡與高之熱情、已達沸點、遂託以終身、高亦允之、新囡之母得悉此事、以木已成舟、亦不加反對、高乃以坦腹自居、無條件住於氏處、與新囡雙飛雙宿、儼然一對伉儷、</p>
<p>▲怏怏佳期躭誤　時高父亦知、對其子大不爲然、嚴加申斥、高以嚴君作梗、雖有迎娶之意、亦不敢言、而瞿翁氏及新囡等以佳期躭誤、心頗怏怏、</p>
<p>▲新囡被母逐出　本月四日晚、高因事出外、瞿翁氏向新囡刺刺道高之短、並令新囡出外、不准歸家、新囡聞言大恚、遂潛自出外、至廣東路二四九號門牌上海新旅社十六號房間居住、因囊空如洗、向小姊妹車瑞雲借得洋七元、作爲房金、</p>
<p>▲登報聲明捲逃　而瞿翁氏自新囡出外後、即登報聲明、謂女捲取賬洋一百餘元、及金戒金鈕等物、女不顧、惟與高商嫁娶事、詎事機不密、爲女之母舅翁吕溪查悉女之住處、於前晚往老閘捕房報告、由捕頭飭探趙子仁、西探戤時李、於深夜十二時、往該旅館將女及高一併拘獲、帶入捕房、分别收押、</p>
<p>▲捕房訴高毓良　昨晨解送特區法院刑一庭、由許家栻庭長與徐枚檢察官升座提訊、捕房律師汝葆彝起稱、捕房現以刑法二百五十七條和誘略誘未滿二十歲之男女脫離享有親屬權之人監護人或保佐人之罪控訴高毓良、而並未起訴瞿新囡、故新囡祇居於證人地位、但此項告訴、係捕房根據告訴人之請求爲之、並將本案事實、詳述一過、</p>
<p>▲託付終身經過　繼據瞿翁氏投稱、新囡潛逃時、尙捲去金飾賬洋云云、又由瞿新囡供稱、我與高毓良結識、係在本年二月、後經我三個月之試騐、覺其人頗爲可靠、故於五月將終身付託與彼、遂發生肉體關係、此次乃阿母將我逐出者、并非高之誘惑、出外時、亦未捲去絲毫物件、即旅館房金、亦借自他人處、我友曾探我母之口氣、據母謂必不欲我回家、且姊亦言我如再回家、有何面目、是以我不敢返家、自我被拘至捕房、我即請准我出外、與彼告之父商議嫁娶方法、因此事必須其父出面方可、但母等堅不允許、使我在捕房拘留一宵、</p>
<p>▲高毓良之陳述　又據車瑞雲證明瞿翁氏自女出外後、不欲其返家、脫離母女關係、詰之被告高毓良供、我住於原告處有一月餘、此次並非我略誘新囡、實係新囡逃出後、招我至旅館者云云、</p>
<p>▲實無略誘行爲　汝葆彝律師即向瞿翁氏詢問、是否尙須告、高氏答須控告、因高誘我女、汝律師遂向庭上聲稱、原告旣仍須繼續控告、捕房似不便將告訴撤回、但本案被告與瞿新囡之關係及被告所供食住均在原告處之語、瞿翁氏亦均承認、故據敝律師目光觀測、本案被告、實無略誘之行爲、應請庭上裁奪云云、許家栻庭長核供、當庭宣告高毓良無罪、</p>
<p>▲本案餘音嫋嫋　瞿新囡交其母瞿翁氏領回、嗣聞新囡與車瑞雲等回至瞿宅時、瞿翁氏及其弟毆打瞿新囡、車瑞雲報告華探邱恩九、現已投老閘捕房、尙未知如何了結也、</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>女人們在鏡子上取得了對於伊自已的判斷。而男子們却在别的女子的眼中。取得了對於他自已的判斷。</p>
<p>▲假使世界上的男子。能把用在女人身上的一切精力和勇氣。用在事業方面。那末這世界上就可以增加了不少的大富翁和大人物了。</p>
<p>▲一個摩登的女子。在結婚的時候。决不會畏懼。因爲伊想結婚而不能得快活。那末離婚之後。至少可以嘗到一點愉快。</p>
<p>▲現代的青年。需要着一個愛他而不使他受束縛的女性。並不需要能熱烈地愛他而同時使他行動不便的妻子。</p>
<p>▲當一時男女同坐閑談。女的聽見了男的講了一個笑話。而笑得全身發抖時間很久時。他倆已有了結婚的可能。然而男的有時却還莫明其故。</p>
<p>▲受了愛情上的巨創時。智慧是一個膏藥。哲學是一種香油。時間是一服止痛劑三物旣備。創痛若失。</p>
<p>▲在三十五歲以前的男子。想起了婚姻。大半會發抖。好像一隻狗看見了繩子一樣。</p>
<p>▲深深地熱熱地墮入於情網時。享受快樂的容量。就比例地增加。然而享受快樂的機會。就此也比例地减少。</p>
<p>▲全世界的女子們。假使你想阻止你的丈夫在外面游蕩而樂不思家時。你就會大大的失望。因爲這種事故是没法挽救的。除非是時間、幸運、死亡、離婚、和忍耐。</p>
<p>▲普通的男子對於女子心理的變化。很不易瞭解。這好比我們對於無線電報一樣的莫明其桔構。</p>

<p>吾邑有無賴李某。故世家子。以嗜博如命。盡罄其產。退而與流氓乞丐爲伍。得精胠篋術。喜竊鞋。尤喜竊女性所御之高跟鞋。其竊鞋之術。神妙莫測。水滸傳中之時遷白勝。殆亦不過如此。邑人因其肖鼠。呼之爲偷鞋鼠云。</p>
<p>偷鞋鼠除廢曆初一月半外。日必偷鞋十餘雙。藏邑廟門前棋杆上之大斗中。人皆不知。每閱十日。將所竊各式布鞋皮鞋。一一審視。敝破者。陳舊者。有臭氣者。悉投廟東糞坑中。其完整無恙。而色采如新者。則用紙包裹。赴城出售。今春四月中。狂風大作。廟前棋杆。忽焉折斷。斗墮地粉碎。鞋亦紛紛落下。如蛺蜨飛舞。邑人蜂擁往觀。始悉此斗爲偷鞋鼠之藏鞋所。歎爲異想天開。嘖嘖稱奇。而偷鞋鼠因贓物敗露。係遭天妒。於是遷地爲良。另覓神秘之窟。爲其藏鞋所矣。</p>
<p>前月。某小學校長顧君。與沈女士結婚。沈爲富紳女公子。愛修飾。衣服入時。窮極奢華。一鞋之微。輒耗至十餘金。以故最爲偷鞋鼠所垂涎。一年之中。失鞋者屢。雖善爲保藏。嚴爲戒備。終不獲效。迨新婚之夜。恐鏤金革履。再告失踪。乃倩伴房抱鞋匣而眠。着意維護。至天明時。伴房一覺醒來。視懷中鞋匣。依然如故。欣然報告新娘曰。小姐洪福。者番偷鞋鼠徒勞往返。無所施其技矣。新娘聞言。亦私自欣幸。解繩啓蓋。擬即穿用。詎匣中物已非廬山眞面目。乃一長僅三寸之弓鞋。似老媪輩物。而破敝不堪。沈女士覩狀。呆若木雞。此懷匣而眠負有護鞋使命之伴房。則驚悸幾無人色矣。</p>
<p>又舍親周女士。亦曾一度失鞋。竟珠還合浦。事頗有趣。茲記之如下。女士因事赴城。見一小肆中。陳革驊無數。標明特别大廉價。照碼對折。乃費番佛三尊。購得一雙。鞋頗精緻。女士深寳之。返里後未滿旬日。又遭偷鞋鼠之覬覦。宣告失踪。方忱惜不置。而僅越一夜。鞋忽發現於馬桶蓋上。鞋中附有一條。上書「此爲我手中經過物。是從某店購來耶」二語。後女士調查。此鞋果係賊貨。本爲同學錢女士所有。於去歲失竊云。</p>

<p>喬督生於一二六六。死於二三三七。他是文藝復興初期大畫家谷伐宜Giovanni弟子。他師生倆。是文藝復興的先鋒。喬督幼時。本是一個牧羊童。一日喬督在石壁上畫了一隻羊。爲谷伐宜所賞識。因而師事之。後成一代大家。在這敎堂中。大半是喬督的宗敎壁畫。他原來是基督敎傳說的解釋者。所以他的畫面。都偏於形式的描寫。手法稍滯。遠近法亦不完全。但他所描寫人物的純潔。却勝於後來盛期的諸名作。</p>
<p>谷伐宜的繪畫。傳世者甚少。在這個敎堂内有他手製的磁土浮雕數件。意大利文藝復興初期。有一種磁土浮雕。至今在美術史特筆記載。因當時在磁土浮雕上有驚人的絶技。谷伐宜即發明磁土浮雕最早的一人。看過了喬督的壁畫。再入壳洛司敎堂。堂之正廳兩傍。有意大利歷來名人之墳墓十餘處。其中爲余所特别注意者有二墓。一是文豪但丁。Dante一是大藝術家米葛朗極羅。Michlangelo</p>
<p>（六）瑪爾谷Marco敎堂此堂内壁畫甚多。其中有一幅「天使下降」圖。是文藝復興初期大畫家恩喬力克的手筆。此畫在敎堂二樓走廊之牆上。</p>
<p>恩喬力克Angelico是宗敎的信徒。善描禍福報應。頗負盛名於當時。筆法在畫中極稱雄健。色彩亦富麗。寺内大壁畫之外。尙有耶穌事蹟圖。每圖陳列一小間。計十餘間。對面一排同樣的小室中。亦有十數室。是塞伏納羅拉Savonarola的壁畫。塞伏納羅拉。是恩喬力克以後的大畫。家。也是宗敎徒。手法略同。描寫耶穌叙事圖。極有聲望。他的題材。都偏於事實的說明。</p>

<p>雌老虎是一向留心在偵察的。老爺和馬車夫。都在伊察看之中。根生倒也從來不曾露出破綻。今天爲了大太太三個字。却被伊捉住了。那時是出於不防備。一時無可騰挪。只是支吾着。這位太太。在家裏好似一位女法官般。經不得伊幾句話盤駁。便使罪人心膽驚慌。可是伊知道今天問急了。反而不好。使對面有所防範。便也不再問下去。過了兩三天後。老爺眞正出門到杭州去了。太太便喚了根生進去。和言悅色的給他說道。你前天喚我大太太。當時問你。你不肯說。可是現在我已經知道了。我是大太太。原來還有一位姨太太在那裏。那是這位太太的老公事。凡是審訊不肯招承的犯人。都是用一種虚冒文章。或是傍敲側擊。自然而然的口供來了。根生被伊這樣的一虚冐。心裏就慌了。伊說的是姨太太。上海人姨與二字相近。誤聽伊說的二太太。便急辦道。没有什麽二太太呀。殷太太笑道。不但二太太。還有三太太咧。根生道。三太太的確没有。太太道。那末二太太是有的了。根生道。這個。…這個。…太太道。你不要這個那個。老爺完全都告訴我了。我又不是不許老爺討姨太太。就是恨他討了姨太太。却瞞三瞞四。不肯告訴我。一個男人家。三妻四妾。只要討得起。有什麽要緊。現在瞞了我。顯見得我是不賢惠了。所以我已經給老爺說通了。旣然討了人。何必住在外面。在大公館裏熱閙一點不好。何必要在外面借小公館。晚上也不必弄到深更半夜回來了。就是你們也可以早點睡。省力一點。根生想。我們的老爺千叮萬囑。不許我在家裏告訴隨便什麽人。他討姨太太以及借小房子的事。尤其是大太太面前。不許洩半個字兒怎麽自已先去告訴伊呢。伊是出名的雌老虎呢。我想伊是在老爺面前。總是用着一種胃功。或是騙功。把老爺的話冒出來騙出來了。我們的這位老爺。眞是一個忠厚老實人。只怕從此二太太要吃苦頭咧。旣是老爺自己已經說了。我又何必再給他隱瞞呢。他這樣的一想。不想正中了這位太太之計。古人所說的。我雖不殺伯仁。伯仁由我而死。這位二太太的性命。便斷送在根生這個思想中了。正是　妒狂夜雨摧花朶。漏洩春光有柳條。</p>

<p>▲厘拆價格　（洋厘）早市厘價爲七錢二分六厘、較前日早市則同、午市乂昂六毫二忽半、爲七錢二分六厘六毫二忽半、形勢乍上乍落、無甚變動、（銀拆）早午兩市統爲六分、銀根基礎又鬆、劃頭遂始終無加水、銀行掛牌亦無市價、</p>
<p>▲輔幣市情　江南小洋早市爲六錢四分四厘、較前日又跌一厘　午市因無交易、市價遂無變更、廣東小洋早市爲六錢三分六厘、午市爲六錢三分六厘七毫半、結果較昂七毫半、做出交易江角早市二千五百角　早市無交易、廣角早市十二萬角、午市九萬角、銅元又弱一千、爲三百九十一千文</p>

<p>昨日洋米仍有北洋帮購裝、市面乃居定局、計售開一號西貢米七百包、價仍開十二元半、客秈則存到兩足、兼被船貨湧到影響、市面續趨下游、雖有南洋帮閩粤各客問津、行情仍小一角以上、計開出江西機早一千包、價十元零二角半、十元九元半不等、又機元二百五十包、價十四元六角半至十四元七角、其他各米均無交易、惟南京米及皖省糙米均有續到、湘米等雖不划乏到、後形終看疲軟耳、</p>

<p>▲粉市　上午開盤後　因洋麥報價略好、人心曾一度振奮、較前日收價、好起近分、以後各盤、則已呈近堅遠疲之象、因本月份之標準、雖已隨環境而低落、但各廠現貨、則仍須三錢左右、故一部份之廠家　已從事怍進、致市氣已轉佳象、遠期各月份因内地客户多頭、不顧行情　紛紛反賣、故市面依然不振、結果本月份較前日好二厘半、十一月份小二厘半、十二月小五厘、正月份小一分、二三月份小一分二厘半云、</p>
<p>▲麥市　上下午開盤後、各月份市面、呈近堅遠疲之象、本月份因已近交割、多頭方面、鑒於市上現貨、中次居多、用以交割、多不合格、故人心遂呈穩定、至遠期各月份、雖洋麥報好三四角、但一般人因已無關係可言、仍一致暢出、蓋空頭所持者、以洋麥已有立成、對於本麥、當然不能站住、所以市面依然小落、結果本月份較前日反好二分、十一月份小三分、十二月份小四分、正二月份小五分、三月份小七分、現麥市况、高貨未開、祗開普通鎭江麥六百包價三兩九錢云、</p>

<p>海味　魷魚產薄銷滯</p>
<p>魷魚刻查滬存陳貨統街僅有三百餘包、新貨收成邇日據東洋產地報告、洋生不如前之湧旺、故來源亦見減稀、惟各帮銷胃仍歸萎弱、所到之貨、殊少轉動、行號市盤、因亦缺乏變卦、現售全清大片廂魷四十三兩、統貨四十一兩至四十兩、桃魷三十九兩　陳貨價目相仿、新二番對州魷四十二兩至四十兩零五錢、夾油片三十八九兩、金山魷前批到貨已經售通、昨某洋行抛售三禮拜交貨、價三十九兩半、行方均少進胃、聞祗抛出五十桶云、</p>
<p>絲茶　華絲歐銷益無生氣</p>

<p>— 可華</p>
<p>▲聽復旦念五週紀念會後</p>
<p>這次復大的二十五週紀念、居然有個音樂演奏會的舉行、足見該校對於音樂、並不曾當作無關緊要的東西、本來、假如一個成立了二十五年的大學、而再没有音樂的組織、我覺得也是件赧顏的事、雖然、他們的秩序或許不是十分完美的、但是祗要能表現他們的成績、已可見主事者精神了、</p>
<p>該會的節目、除管弦樂隊合奏之外、有小提琴的獨奏、合奏和聲樂的獨唱、合唱等等、管弦樂隊的合奏是「驚喜交集」</p>
<p>（Hey,Gay）、「米儂納」（Mignonette）、「巴達王之登基」「Calith　of　Bagdad」、和那富於東方色彩的「印度之王」（Maharajah）在指揮者的手棒之下、隨着流出諧和的音節、尤以鋼琴者周昌鳴女士的那種小心翼翼的態度、令人起敬、據指導者Lagaspi君告訴我說、「確是可造之才」總之凡管弦合奏、全靠着平時的練習、</p>
<p>葉贊童君的小提琴獨奏！蕭邦的「小夜曲」（Serenade）和吳少甫彭啓炘兩君的小提琴合奏！愛爾加的「愛的贈與」（Salutd'　Amonr）都是兩首有名的小提琴曲、奏來也很動人、其餘的我不能詳細地說、總之、都曾有過相當的訓練、</p>
<p>同時我觀察台下的聽衆、不由地起了懷疑、西洋人對於音樂會特别的重視、穿了禮服而到會、不要說什麽絶對没有喧嘩了、然而台下的笑語雜作、甚至故作嘘嘘之聲、不能不使人懷疑那些來賓之外的大學生們、没有音樂的素養了、那末音樂的敎育是還不曾善遍、因爲有音樂的素養、决不會有這種習性、</p>
<p>這樣、我們須更深信大學校内之音樂的重要性了、我以爲在現時的大學内、爲提倡普遍的音樂敎育起見、至少須具備兩個條件、第一、須有一個管弦樂隊、第二、須設立音樂課程、給以學分、也許有人要不以爲然、以爲儘有旁的更重要的東西、尙不及學習、事實上在中國儘有視音樂爲末技小道的學者、但是、主持大學敎育的學者們呀、我們祇見青年生活的淪於無紀律、越範圍、習於淫邪、希望你們能注意及之咧、</p>

<p>— 彬</p>
<p>宗旨在發揚中國報學</p>
<p>同學均努力民族主義文藝</p>
<p>國内各大學設有新聞學系者、祇有兩處、最早創立的爲北平燕京大學、不過他們的經費是賴於美國傳敎者的負擔、於是、將中國藉的青年學生、培植成外國報界的人材、灌輸多量的宗敎意識、準備將來對於中華民族作一種反宣傳、這種含有宗敎侵略式的新聞敎育、直截的說、在我們民族主義的立塲上看來是絶端地不需要、而且無論它有怎樣的卓績、總認爲是我國辦學者一種絶大的恥辱、其次、我要說到復旦大學的新聞學系了、</p>
<p>它是歸於文學院管轄之下、所以它創設的時間、是在復旦依照敎育部頒佈的大學組織改革之後、在歷史上、當然是很短、祇有一年多的光景、但是内容組織等等均非常的完善、大有「後來居上」之勢、它底宗旨、是在乎養成中國報界專有的人材、灌輸於各種必需的常識、尤重於文藝的熟練、所聘請的指導者、均爲國内報界著名之巨子、如戈公振潘公弼諸氏謝主任辦事之熱忱、亦爲社會人士所共知、否則、開辦了僅有一年多的新聞學系、絶不會有這樣的成績、</p>
<p>該系同學計五十四人、大都在社會上已取得相當的榮譽、如上學期畢業生鄧友德現任北平大學文學院助敎、兼該地益世報等附刋編輯、陳錫良則任本館比較報學諸專職、在校生如湯增敭在國内文藝界已得相當的榮譽、現兼任該校預科國文敎授、黃奐若爲唯一具有民族主義文藝中心的「草野周刋」特約撰述員、王德亮掌復旦通訊社社長、杜編文主編復旦五日刋、此輩均爲該系之傑出人才、本學期錄取新生僅鄭國經、汪融、熊佩芬、田菊裳、陳翔中等五人、足見考察入學成績甚爲嚴格、據該系主任謝六逸氏云、此次錄取新生、對於思想方面亦頗注意、免得富有普羅意識的份子混雜其間、有碍該系之發展、因爲該系在校諸生、對於民族主義運動均有所景仰、爲此努力已有相當卓績者亦復多人、最近該系出版一本「復旦大學新聞學系紀念刋」、内容極形豐富、有黨國要人與報界巨子朱應鵬張竹平諸氏之題字、程天放瞿旡諸氏之論著、由此、可見該系成績之一班了、</p>

<p>(Harbin) The Sino-Russian conference has seen no negotiations in recent days. On the 14th, Karakhan sent a note to Mo Teh-hui, raising four demands: (1) Implement the Bery Agreement; (2) Rapidly dissolve White Russian political groups and military activities; (3) Return the right to the Harbin City automatic telephone to the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau; (4) The Sino-Russian joint responsibility for the security of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Mo Teh-hui has telegraphed the central government for instructions. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Jinan) Sun Lianzhong sent Chief of Staff Li Han-hui to Jinan to meet with Han Fu-qu and Chiang Bo-cheng, requesting them to contact the central government on his behalf to pledge allegiance. Han and Chiang telegraphed Chiang for instructions. Chiang replied in a telegram granting permission, ordering Chiang Bo-cheng to accompany Li to Beijing to discuss solutions. Li told reporters that his army consists of over 30,000 men in four divisions, currently stationed around Xinxiang. Feng [Yuxiang]'s faction left Xinxiang on the 9th, heading west from Nanxiaojizhen with four or five followers. Lu Zhonglin and Sun Liangcheng decided to go into retirement, handing over everything to Sun. Zheng Dazhang, Liu Chunrong, and Sun Dianying's troops are also under Sun's command, totaling 60,000 men. The Hebei Feng army can be completely resolved, but Song Zheyuan and Liu Yufang led a small force to Shaanxi. Han telegraphed Chiang, guaranteeing that Sun has no other intentions. Sun is currently in Xinxiang. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Feng [Yuxiang] has arrived in Taiyuan. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Ti told Deputy Commander Zhang that he plans to set up a deputy commander's office in Beiping and will frequently travel between Beiping and Shenyang. Shi Yusan's sudden oppression of the Jin army has little to do with the Northeast. Although Yan [Xishan] has withdrawn from Shijiazhuang, the future depends on whether Yan realizes his mistakes. Whether the Northeast will continue to advance after taking over Shijiazhuang depends on orders from the central government and cannot be determined at this time. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Yan [Xishan] arrived in Bingzhou (Taiyuan), he appointed Zhang Yinwu as acting commander-in-chief. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng [Yuxiang] is still at Lijiaji in southern Shanxi and has agreed with Lu [Zhonglin] that Feng will temporarily stay out of the public eye. All orders will be carried out by Lu. Yan [Xishan] will grant Feng's troops 500,000 Shanxi banknotes per month, asking them not to enter Shanxi territory. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan [Xishan] sent personnel to Beiping and Tianjin to purchase pigments and print more Shanxi banknotes, entrusting commercial firms to transport them. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is entrusted that someone earnestly ask the Northeast authorities to facilitate Wang Jingwei's departure overseas. Wang is scheduled to go to Tianjin on the 19th to set sail. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Northeast Army Begins Taking Over Defense of Zhengding and Shijiazhuang <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Northeast Army has taken over the defense of Shijiazhuang and Zhengding. Bai Fengxiang reported to Yu Xuezhong on the 17th that his troops were going to Shijiazhuang. A telegram from Staff Officer Guan, who liaised with Li Fuying, stated that the defense of Zhengding and Shijiazhuang will be handed over on the 19th. Peng's division led two cavalry regiments and withdrew from Shijiazhuang to Huolu on the 17th. Apart from sending Chief of Staff Wang Zhaokun with a portion of the troops to take over Zhengding and Shijiazhuang in advance, his troops led the entire brigade to advance. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday, a foreign envoy asked the authorities whether Shi's [Yousan] recent oppression of the Jin army was an order from the central government or a command from the Northeast. The reply was that it did not seem to be an order from the central government nor a command from the Northeast. However, Shi's troops are quite aware and inclined toward the central government and the Northeast. Someone stationed in Beiping from Shi's troops said that Shi entrusted Han Fuju and Ma Hongda to pledge allegiance to the central government. Chiang [Kai-shek] appointed him as the Commander-in-Chief of the 13th Route Army. This northern advance to pursue the Jin army is a small demonstration of merit to strengthen the central government's belief and make it easier for the Northeast to take over the defense. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A telegram from Beiping on the 17th stated that the 6th Cavalry Brigade of the Northeast entered Shijiazhuang on the evening of the 17th. Li Fuying telegraphed Yu Xuezhong, requesting to send troops to take over the defense. The entire Jin army withdrew to Niangziguan. Shi Yusan's troops advanced rapidly from Cizhou towards Handan, seizing countless weapons from the Jin army. The Jin army blew up the Shatie Bridge and retreated westward. (Special telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The last batch of Jin troops withdrew from Shijiazhuang yesterday afternoon. The 6th Cavalry Brigade of the Northeast Army has been ordered to take over the defense last night.

<h3 id="e14">The British Liberal Party's Views on Unemployment Relief <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Unemployment relief is the most important issue in the world today. Therefore, various countries have proposals for unemployment relief. Even within Britain, the Labour government has the Labour government's proposals, the Conservative Party has the Conservative Party's proposals, and the Liberal Party has the Liberal Party's proposals. According to the Liberal Party leader's speech at the conference, regarding the Liberal Party's discussion with the Labour Party on the unemployment issue, the Liberal Party's proposal is that the government should convene a conference of representatives from various industrial and commercial capitalists and trade union banks to propose reducing production costs without hindering the lives of workers, so as to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of British industry. The government should also actively reduce expenditures and greatly oppose requests for subsidies, pensions, and family allowances. It also advocates that the state should raise debts to carry out public works.</p>
<p>In short, unemployment relief is primarily about enabling the unemployed to have work. However, the work they are given cannot compete excessively with existing businesses or be related to work that hinders commerce. Therefore, whether it's any country, they generally consider carrying out public works as a common point. This is because public works can accommodate a certain number of unemployed people without competing with other goods or industries. However, due to the limited financial resources of the state, public works cannot be unlimited.</p>

Father Lebbe also proposed that if foreign missionaries are harmed, it should be blamed on the missionary's lack of sincerity, and international negotiations and demands for compensation should not be raised, in order to avoid the notoriety of using politics as a backing.

<p>After Publication of Policy Guidelines</p>
<p>Fierce Debate in Parliament</p>
<p>▲Guomin 17th Berlin Dispatch The German Parliament today passed on its second reading a bill authorizing the Treasury to sign a loan contract with the New York Lee Higginson banking company for 500 million marks. This loan is not only beneficial in terms of conditions, but also demonstrates the confidence of foreign capitalists in the stability of German finances, so it is of great value. During the discussion of this bill, Treasury Secretary Dietel and members of the National Socialist Party had a fierce argument. The party frequently made noise to prevent the Treasury Secretary from speaking. The Treasury Secretary sternly rebuked them, pointing out that these people were deliberately creating panic, destroying government credit, making society more unstable, and increasing unemployment. The government's financial plan is the only way to solve the current situation. The National Party is not prepared to provide a solution, and if they were to govern, they would only make things worse. After the bill was passed, after a short break, the government's declaration was discussed. The debate was not as fierce as expected. First, former Prime Minister Müller, the leader of the Social Democratic Party, delivered a speech, couching his words in reasonable terms, expressing that his party was willing to support the government to overcome the major political and financial crisis. Next, National Socialist Party member Strasser delivered a speech. At this time, Deputy Speaker Stoll, who is also a leader of the party, chaired the meeting. Strasser first pointed out that the cabinet could not fully adapt to reality, and then elaborated on the party's demands, saying that the party did not want to abolish the Young Plan, but demanded that the modification mechanisms stipulated in the plan must be used immediately. He also strongly denied that the party had a plan to exclude the Serbs, saying that its aim was only to remove all Jews from the administrative and judicial organs. He then explained the party's attitude towards armaments, believing that since the former Entente powers were determined to evade the disarmament obligations in the Treaty of Versailles, Germany must also complete its own armaments and should reintroduce nationwide conscription to replace the current recruitment system. "However, we have personally experienced war and terrorism, and there is no desire for war in our hearts." Later, his words became more and more intense. When denouncing the prevalence of militarism throughout the country, he even referred to General Groener, the Minister of Defense, as a "traitor." At this, Deputy Speaker Stoll of the party ordered him to pay attention to discipline, and the entire audience responded with applause. According to the current arrangement, the motion of no confidence will probably be discussed on Saturday evening. It is difficult to predict the situation, but the government believes that it can win and that it can find ways to consolidate its parliamentary base during the seven-week parliamentary recess in the future.</p>

The government should set an example and actively reduce expenditures, as Australia has done, and attention should be paid to the cost of unemployment relief. If those who make inappropriate requests for subsidies are prevented, millions of people can be preserved. As for the demands for old-age pensions and family allowances, they are crazy. Furthermore, the country's tax burden should be reduced as soon as possible, George said. George suggested raising national development bonds to carry out public works.</p>

The words are: Alas, Mr., you are the hero of the party and the country. You demonstrated your talent in literature and gained fame early in life. You followed up on the righteousness in Hubei. You rose up in Hunan to assist the people. The villains were rampant and the Central Plains were in turmoil. Your bright integrity and exemplary conduct were clearly distinguished. You came to the South and led the army, joining in the grand plan and turning the tide. When China was turbulent, you were awe-inspiring. Your martial exploits in the Five Ridges and Three Xiang were remarkable. You raised the banner of righteousness for the Northern Expedition and restored our divine territory. Alas, Mr., you assisted and rectified, and heretical theories flourished. You were upright and unyielding. The rebellious bandits continued to rise up, claiming to be legitimate and betraying the country, unleashing their brutality. The Commander-in-Chief rose up in anger and launched a distant expedition. You were in charge of the central command and stood firm like the Great Wall. The great traitor will be wiped out, and the foundation of the country is firm. The grand plan for national construction is about to be realized. However, a shocking storm and severe frost block the road. Heaven is unpitying and takes away our Yi Yin and Fu Yue. Alas, we grieve. Recalling your virtue, we look up to your example. Your voice and appearance are gone, and days and months pass. Millions of people mourn, and your legacy will be long-lasting. We offer fragrant wine, hoping to reach your spirit. Alas, enjoy!"</p>
<p>▲National Government: Chairman Jiang Zhongzheng, members Hu Hanmin, Wang Chonghui, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Cai Yuanpei, and personnel from the Civil Affairs and Military Affairs offices attended. Jiang Zhongzheng presided over the offering, offered flowers, and the staff of the ceremony group read the eulogy, which read: "On the 18th day of October, the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Chairman of the National Government, Jiang Zhongzheng, and all the members, respectfully offer incense to the spirit of Tan Gong Zu'an, the member of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan, saying: Alas, the great turmoil is gradually subsiding, and construction is the urgent task. How could you leave the responsibility of the party and the country and pass away? You devoted yourself to the task until your last breath, and although your body is gone, your merits will be immortal. In the past, during the Xinhai Revolution, Wuhan rose up in revolt, and Hunan was the first to respond. In the midst of danger, you took on the difficult task. This is your merit. In the campaigns to overthrow Yuan Shikai and protect the Constitution, you extended the great righteousness to the world and acted as the safeguard of the southwest. This is another of your merits. You led the Hunan army to the nation's distress, traveling through the Lingnan region. When the Prime Minister was alive, you exhausted your wisdom and loyalty, bearing hardship and suffering. After the Prime Minister passed away, until the establishment of the capital in Nanjing and the establishment of the Five Yuan, troubles were frequent and there were many changes. Often, you made major plans and resolved major doubts, saving our country from danger and leading to the prosperity of unity and peace. This is especially your merit. We hoped that political reforms would be clear and the people would be happy, and that you would have time to fulfill your aspirations in Dongshan. However, the villains and traitors have been colluding and rebelling since last year, and we have had no choice but to use the nation's military force to remove the obstacles during the period of political tutelage. The difficult battles have lasted for many years. Thanks to you for sitting in the central command and carefully managing affairs, you were regarded with importance at home and abroad. We did not initially think that the reason for your worry and overwork would eventually become incurable. However, you never treated your body as your own, so you still forced yourself to work for the public, day and night. We did not expect that after the great army won and the Central Plains were pacified, Heaven would not spare you and a wise man would suddenly pass away. Alas, the task is heavy and the road is long, which is what the ancients called 'magnanimous and resolute.' Your life's work is brilliant and clear, and it will be recorded in the books and made known, and it will last for a hundred years without fading. The government deeply considers the meaning of honoring and rewarding, and has clearly ordered a state funeral to be held with the utmost solemnity. However, working hard for the country is something that cannot be done by one person. Setting up the funeral arrangements, we cannot help but feel sadness from within. We can only恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪恪</p>

<p>▲ Proposes Four Conditions for Surrender to the Central Government</p>
<p>▲ Shi Will Remain Commander-in-Chief of the Thirteenth Route Army</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The issue of Shi Yousan's troops surrendering has been rumored for many days. Yesterday, Shi dispatched his deputy commander, Qin Jianbin, to Jinan via Zhangde, to meet with Han Fuju and Jiang Bocheng to express his willingness to surrender. He also requested Han and Jiang to petition the central government on four conditions: (1) grant him official recognition; (2) designate a place of residence; (3) provide a monthly allowance; and (4) request permission to attack Shanxi. Jiang Bocheng telegraphed Chairman Jiang for instructions and received a reply that read: "To General Commander Han in Jinan and my brother Jiang Bocheng, Chief of Staff: (Secret) Please convey to brother (Han) that Shi's troops may be granted the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Thirteenth Route Army, but his movements must be subject to the orders of Deputy Commander Zhang. Chiang Kai-shek, sealed." Jiang Bocheng informed Qin of these terms, and Qin has already telegraphed Shi for instructions. According to Qin, most of Shi's army is located in the Xinxiang, Weihui, and Zhangde areas, and Shi himself is in Zhangde. Recently, they intercepted weapons from several thousand Shanxi soldiers. This morning, a reporter visited Jiang Bocheng, who said that Shi Yousan had accepted the conditions and assumed his post as Commander-in-Chief of the Thirteenth Route Army in Zhangde. However, he has not yet received Shi's telegram announcing his assumption of office. He telegraphed Nanjing a few days ago, requesting permission to return to Nanjing to rest, but General Commander Jiang replied, stating: "Your telegram is received. It is essential that you remain in Jinan to continue negotiations." Therefore, he still needs to discuss other issues regarding Shi's troops with Chairman Han. According to a well-informed but unofficial source close to Han and Shi, the relationship between Shi and Han is very close, so the issue of Shi's surrender should not encounter any further complications. Qin Jianbin's visit to Jinan on behalf of Shi was at Han's invitation. Since the central government has granted Shi the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Thirteenth Route Army, Shi can naturally assume his post. However, due to various factors and the actions of the past two years, the wording of the telegram announcing his assumption of office will be extremely difficult. Furthermore, regarding the issue of defense zone control, the central government's decision to assign it to the Northeast is due to its own unavoidable constraints. Shi may also accept the control and command of the Northeast. However, Shi currently has five armies, totaling no less than fifty to sixty thousand men. The army commanders are Shen Ke, Sun Guangqian, Su Mingqi, Mi Yunhe, and Yuan Dexing. Can the Northeast feed and accommodate these fifty to sixty thousand men in Hebei? This is also Shi's biggest concern. As for Shi's previous expression of willingness to listen to Han's command, it may be practically impossible due to various factors. Therefore, the authorities are still carefully considering how to settle Shi's troops. Also, Ma Fuxiang, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, arrived in Jinan yesterday, and Qin Jianbin paid him a visit. Some say it is related to the issue of surrender, but the details of their discussion are unknown. It is also said that Han is scheduled to go to Kaifeng in the next few days to continue negotiations on Shi's surrender and the resettlement of the Northwest Army. (October 15)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Progress of the Arrest of Communists in Guangzhou <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ More Than Twenty People Have Been Captured</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: According to a recent intelligence report from Moscow, the central organs of the Third International Communist Party are deeply concerned about the successive failures of the Chinese Communist Party in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi. They fear that the cessation of the Chinese civil war will inevitably lead to a large-scale suppression of the Communists, and the South China Communist Party will be eliminated. Therefore, they quickly convened a meeting to discuss assistance to the South China Communist Party and decided to send more key personnel to Guangdong to command the Guangdong Communist Party to expedite its advance. Upon receiving the report, the Guangdong authorities immediately ordered all military and police units on land and sea in the province to take strict precautions and dispatched investigators to closely apprehend the leaders of the party to prevent the outbreak of chaos. After receiving the orders, the local military and police effectively implemented martial law from the Mid-Autumn Festival and dispatched armed police to inspect pedestrians at all times to prevent bandits from smuggling firearms. From the 6th to the 9th of this month, they arrested more than twenty Communists. Liang Ziguang, the special investigation chief of the Public Security Bureau, recently received information that the Communists had scheduled an open-air meeting under the bamboo trees in the Eastern Suburbs Training Ground outside the East Suburbs. He immediately dispatched dozens of detectives to ambush the area. The Communists indeed arrived at the appointed time and began their meeting under the trees. They were suddenly surrounded by detectives and more than ten people were captured on the spot and taken to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. It is said that one of them was sent by the highest authority in Moscow and appointed as the chairman of the South China Communist Party Military Affairs Committee, tasked with mobilizing peasant soldiers and the Red Army to launch an uprising on the Double Tenth Day. Among them were also several key figures who came to Guangdong to mobilize workers and police in order to incite uprisings in different locations. Before the 9th, six or seven of the more than twenty people arrested were found to be active in certain circles and had received training. Many others were working in the labor sector. According to their confessions, they were ordered by higher-level Communist committees to mobilize police and labor sectors to prepare for a scheduled uprising at the end of the year. The Public Security Bureau is still conducting strict interrogations of the arrested Communists. After recording their confessions, they will dispatch teams to various locations to apprehend the remaining members of the party. At 4 PM on the afternoon of the 11th, the bureau dispatched a team to Dashatou and arrested Captain Tang and another person from a certain escort team, who were allegedly involved in the Communist case. On the same day, the Huifu Police Station also searched and arrested a Communist named Peng in its jurisdiction. After these continuous searches, the party members have almost disappeared from the city. The military and political organizations also slightly lifted the martial law on the 11th. (October 14)</p>

<h3 id="e79">A Look at Shandong Province's Revenue, Past and Present <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Salt Industry: Past and Present</p>
<p>▲ Sharp Decline in National Tax Revenue</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Shandong Province has been known for its fish and salt resources since ancient times. Guan Zhong used this to dominate the state of Qi. Salt tax alone reached a staggering seven million yuan in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, greatly benefiting national revenue. At that time, the salt tax was only two yuan and five jiao per dan (100 jin). In recent years, frequent wars have disrupted transportation. In salt-producing areas, salt merchants cannot transport salt out, and in salt-consuming areas, people are even at risk of lacking salt. As a result, salt tax revenue has plummeted. The current Salt Transport Commissioner, Wang Zhanghu, has been actively seeking to rectify the situation since taking office. According to Wang, the current salt tax is four yuan per dan, but due to the impact of the war, only 250,000 yuan was collected in September (excluding the fine salt from Qingdao and Yantai, which is directly taxed by the Ministry), which is more than half of what it used to be. The biggest reasons are the lack of vehicles to transport salt and the prevalence of smuggled salt. After deducting the monthly expenses of 40,000 yuan for the Audit Office, the Salt Transport Commissioner's Office, and various salt fields, as well as the 40,000 yuan for foreign debt payments, only about 150,000 to 160,000 yuan is remitted to the central government each month. Now that the war has ended and the province is unified, revenue should improve significantly this month. The rectification measures include eliminating loopholes internally and cracking down on illegal salt production externally. The province's salt industry is divided into Lu coast, Yu coast, Wan coast, Su coast, and Qing salt. The Lu coast includes twenty counties along the coast from Ju County and Rizhao to Dengzhou and Laizhou, as well as Anqiu and Zhucheng, which are the East Coast and operate on a private transport and sale basis. Qing salt is produced in Qingdao and sold exclusively to foreign markets. Both have not been affected by the war. The network merchants belong to the East Outline Public Office: (1) Dingli Company, whose outline stretches to five counties including Mengyin, Linqu, Boxing, Changle, and Xintai, has been suspended for a long time due to the impact of the war. (2) Dingxin Company, whose outline stretches to eleven counties including Guancheng, Fan County, Chaocheng, Shouzhang, Yuncheng, Heze, Dingtao, Chengwu, Jinxiang, Teng County, and Yi County, has had little business due to being in the war zone. (3) Dingyu Company, whose outline stretches to eight counties including De County, Yucheng, En County, Wucheng, Linqing, Qiu County, Tangyi, and Xin County, has also experienced poor business due to the same reasons. In addition, the seven counties of Shouguang, Linqu, Bin County, Putai, Lijin, Guangrao, and Yidu operate on an official-supervised and merchant-sale basis. Wudi, Yangxin, and Zhanhua have always been contracted by Yifeng Company, and Linyi, Tancheng, Fei County, and Yishui have always been contracted by Xiehe Company. The remaining forty-seven counties, including Licheng, also operate on a merchant-sale basis. The nine counties under the jurisdiction of Guide Prefecture on the Yu coast, including Shangqiu, Ningling, Sui County, Yongcheng, Yucheng, Xiayi, Zhecheng, Luyi, and Kaocheng, as well as the two counties of Su County and Guoyang on the Wan coast, and Tongshan County on the Su coast, have always been contracted by Gongli Transportation Company, which is known as South Transport. Due to the impact of the war in recent years, it has been suspended for a long time, and the people in various counties often suffer from a lack of salt. Recently, General Commander Chiang ordered the Jinpu Railway to allocate two trains to transport salt from Haizhou to provide relief. Shandong's salt tax has naturally suffered a great loss. However, the four counties of Feng County, Pei County, Xiao County, and Dangshan on the Su coast are contracted by Luchang Company and are still struggling to maintain operations. Such is the general situation of Shandong's salt affairs. The method of rectifying the wasteland counties is to re-invite merchants to contract with the various companies that have been suspended, and to find ways to reorganize those with poor business. As long as the war stops, military and private transportation is cut off, transportation is restored, and banditry is eliminated, Shandong's salt affairs are not without solutions. It is expected that the salt tax revenue for this month can reach about 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since the great war in Shandong, the province has not recovered its vitality, and various industries have declined. The impact on various tax revenues, especially national tax revenues, has been the greatest. On the 15th, the reporter visited Chen Jiadong, the financial commissioner and director of the tobacco and alcohol affairs bureau, at the financial commissioner's office to inquire about the national tax revenue and rectification plans. According to Chen, he was ordered to come to Shandong to serve as the financial commissioner and director of the tobacco and alcohol affairs bureau. After taking over in Jinan, it has only been a week, and all affairs have not yet been fully arranged. He is currently reviewing the situation of the previous tax bureaus to prepare for rectification. The original expenses of the Shandong Financial Commissioner's Office were more than 10,000 yuan. Currently, the Ministry of Finance has cut the expenses of the Financial Commissioner's Office in order to save expenses, and the expenses of the Shandong Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau are used as the expenses of both the Commissioner's Office and the Affairs Bureau, with only more than 6,000 yuan per month. Because expenses are so difficult, the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau has moved to the Commissioner's Office. All the staff of the Commissioner's Office are also staff of the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau. The former section chiefs are also section chiefs, and the former staff members are also staff members, in order to save expenses. At present, after the military affairs in Shandong, the income of each bureau has been greatly reduced. Those who used to earn 100,000 yuan now only earn 10,000 or 20,000 yuan. Compared before and after, the ratio is ten to one, so that the income is not enough to cover the local expenses. It may be possible to increase it slightly in about one or two months. Many of the staff of the tax bureaus in various counties are currently temporarily appointed by the military, and it is inevitable that there will be inconsistencies in the procedures. They are currently contacting everything separately. Chen plans to visit the bureaus in various places after the Jinan affairs are arranged, in order to find ways to rectify them. Regarding the employment of personnel, he plans to adopt an examination system. The Financial Commissioner's Office originally had more than 50 staff members, the Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau originally had more than 30 staff members, and about 100 people came from Jiangxi with Chen Jiadong. Currently, in order to meet the budget, only more than 30 people have been selected and the rest have been laid off in order to save expenses. He also plans to recruit some graduates from Shandong Commercial School, provide them with subsidies, and come to the office to practice. After gaining some experience, they will be appointed to positions. Extra attention should be paid to the division of national and local taxes to clarify the boundaries. (October 15)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Post-War Inspection Report of the Longhai Railway <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ As Described by the Xuzhou Press Inspection Group</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: The Central Army fought for the longest time and most fiercely on the Longhai Railway. Now that the war has ended, the Xuzhou press organized a post-war inspection group, which departed westward on the day after the Double Tenth Festival to inspect the war remains. The details of the journey are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Battle Trenches Along the Way: The reporter group departed westward from Xuzhou at 1 PM on the 11th, attaching themselves to a Xu-Zheng passenger train. The passenger cars were extremely crowded, and the train moved slowly. By the time they reached Dangshan, night had already fallen. Upon reaching Dangxi, they found a prepared battle trench of the Central Army. At 10 PM, the train passed Guide, which was the site of the initial fierce battle during the military campaign. West of the station, there were one or two small battle trenches along the way across Xiaoba to Liuhe, but it was impossible to distinguish whether they belonged to our side or the enemy. Liuhe was where Commander-in-Chief Chiang supervised the battle. Near the station, there were one or two small forests. People at the station said that the Commander-in-Chief often stayed in the forest during the hot summer. The train stopped on three tracks. This place had a lot of sand and water was not readily available, so the hardship was indescribable. Continuing west, the train passed Libaji and Yejiagang, and there were more and more trenches along the way. From here, past Neihuang to Lanfeng, was where the Yan-Feng army's defenses were the most solid and where the Central Army's final fierce battle took place, so they paid close attention to observation. At this time, the moon was just waning and hanging high in the sky. Because this place had a lot of wind and sand, the light was faint, but when it shone on the ground, it could be seen very clearly. The ditches and slopes nearby could be clearly distinguished. About fifteen li east of Neihuang, there was a large battle trench of the Yan-Feng army, about one zhang deep and wide, spanning both sides of the railway. Behind the trench were machine gun positions, soldier positions, and communication trenches. About six or seven li east of Neihuang, there was also a large battle trench, whose construction was roughly the same as the previous trench. It was said that these two trenches were mostly for infantry to ambush. A particularly large battle trench was outside the Neihuang station, about one zhang seven or eight chi deep and wide. The earth fort behind the trench also seemed higher. The artillery positions, gun positions, infantry positions, communication trenches, and rest covers behind the fort were intertwined and indistinguishable. The fiercest battle between the two armies took place here, and the final outcome also depended on this trench. Unfortunately, the passenger train continued to move forward, and the Neihuang station was desolate, so it was inconvenient to get off and stay overnight. They continued to follow the train. East of Lanfeng, they found two more large battle trenches of the Yan-Feng army. Viewed from the train, the communication trenches behind the fortresses behind the trenches curved and slanted out, like plum blossom petals. Therefore, scholars called it the plum blossom trench. In total, these five large battle trenches all spanned the railway line, which was endless. It was said that it extended north to the Yellow River and south beyond Qizhou to approach the Pinghan Railway. There were also several small battle trenches distributed in the area of Libaji and Yejiagang and between the five major battle trenches. One can imagine how much labor the Yan-Feng army spent building this. The area along the way was mostly sandy, and the villages were very sparse. In the Neihuang area, even when straining their eyes to look far into the moonlight, they could not see forests or villages. The desolate scene was indescribable. At 4 AM on the morning of the 12th, they arrived at Lanfeng Station. Apart from the ticket office on the platform, there were no inns. The reporter group went to the Xushang United Relief Team office of the Gospel Church behind the station for temporary accommodation.</p>
<p>▲ Visiting Lanfeng: At 8 AM on the morning of the 12th, the reporter group went to inspect Lanfeng City, which was north of the station, less than a li away. It was built of brick, and the battlements were very incomplete, but it was due to years of disrepair and not due to shelling. The city was extremely desolate. There was only one cross street, which reached the four gates. Along the street, there were many dilapidated and deserted empty rooms with no occupants. Inside the South Gate was the Zhongshan Bridge, and the water flow was quite wide and deep. Occasionally, three or five small boats could be seen paddling in it. Standing on the bridge, one could see the east and west cities, and the vastness of the land could be known. The county government was dozens of steps inside the South Gate, and the scale was extremely simple. The reporters sent in their name cards to visit, and County Magistrate Fang Tinghan had just returned from Bian. According to him, he was appointed by Zhang Fang, the acting chairman of the temporary provincial government, and took office on the 27th in Qinzhai, the fifth district of southern Lanfeng. The Central Army captured Lanfeng on the morning of the 30th, and he entered the city to take office on October 1st. After the Feng army retreated from Neihuang, they only resisted once in the east and west Gangtou Villages of the city on the 29th before collapsing westward. The Central Army's Fan Xiji's troops were the first to enter Lan City on the morning of the 30th. The Feng army left a covering force in Sanyizhai, 25 li west of the city, and were defeated by the Central Army's pursuit troops on the night of the 1st. On the 2nd, the Feng army completely left Lan territory. When the war first started, Lanfeng was the defense zone of the Jin army, and Xu Yongchang was stationed here. After two fierce battles, it was replaced by the Feng army, which was garrisoned by Sun Liangcheng. When the Feng army finally retreated, Sun commanded the retreat. The disaster situation after the war was extremely serious. The Provincial Relief Association has sent personnel to investigate. The total length of battle trenches dug in the territory reached more than 720,000 chi. The plan is to use labor as a substitute for relief and employ civilians to fill them in, requiring more than 22,000 taels of silver. Because the Jin army had forced the digging of battle trenches and demanded livestock when they first arrived, many people fled. Most of the farmers who remained had no livestock to cultivate. Currently, only five out of ten people have returned to their villages after the war. The Feng army demanded 200,000 dan of wheat before retreating and now demands 20,000 yuan, ordering the district chiefs to do so, otherwise they will be put in shackles and imprisoned. The people's strength has been exhausted, and about half has been supplied. Sixty prisoners have been released. Local seasonal diseases are prevalent. The bodies on the battlefield have been treated and buried by the Xushang Mulian Association Relief Team. The police team's guns were confiscated by the Feng army, and only the standing militia is maintaining law and order. Bandits are rising up in the four villages, and the county government is unable to send teams to suppress them, which is extremely worrying. Commander-in-Chief Chiang visited Lan City on the 2nd, accompanied by Ma Fuxiang, Zhang Zhijiang, Chen Tiaoyuan, and Shao Lizi. At that time, Fan Xiji was stationed at the county government. Chiang and others stayed at the county government for two hours and then returned to the train. Afterwards, Fan's troops and Ruan Zhaochang's and Jin Handing's troops all advanced westward over the city. The supplementary troops of Chen Tiaoyuan's troops are currently stationed there. According to statistics, there are less than 2,000 households in Lancheng, which is a third-class county in Henan Province. The local products are only peanuts and small amounts of salt. The land is barren, and the war has made it even more difficult. It will take time to recover.</p>
<p>▲ Inspection of Gangtou: At 1 PM, guided by officials from the county government, we went to West Gangtou to inspect the battle trenches. The Red Swastika Society Relief Team also went to investigate. This place is eight li east of the city and is the last defensive fortification of the Feng army to protect the city and station. The ground is sandy and mixed with alkali flats, but the fortifications are extremely solid. The outer moat is about one zhang deep and about eight chi wide. Behind the moat is an earthen barrier, connected to the back wall of the outer moat, with an extremely steep slope. Machine gun positions are arranged on the barrier, followed by soldier positions, followed by communication trenches, followed by rest cover trenches. In addition to the outer moat, deer sheds and electric nets were temporarily set up, totaling seven layers. The solidity of the fortifications is truly rare. This moat runs south across the railway line and north to the Yellow River dike. Battle trenches and communication trenches are intertwined on the dike. According to the villagers, this moat was built by civilian labor. The Feng army captured laborers and forced them to dig, giving them two meals a day. Each meal consisted of two wheat cakes, which were not enough to eat, let alone wages, so many people fled. When the war first started, the Central Army had attacked as far as the east of this moat, but were repelled by the Feng army's counterattack. This time, they broke through this moat and captured Lancheng. Dozens of steps west of the battle trench is a small village. The Jin army generals lived in the villagers' houses, piling thick earth outside the houses to avoid shooting. The back of the house also served as a cellar, covered with thick earth to avoid the bombing of aircraft. There are only three or five houses in the whole village. The reporter personally saw that the villagers ate sorghum cornbread. The outer skin was purple-black due to excessive dryness and hardness, and it was rough and unpalatable. They drank thin sorghum porridge, which was also not like human food. Upon inquiry, it was learned that there was no wheat production in this area, and it was impossible to find anyone selling wheat flour. Just getting enough to eat was enough to make them feel safe. The observations here are enough to show the suffering of the people in the war zone. Behind the battle trench, close to the east of the city, there are many graves of the Feng army, about a thousand in total. They all have wooden markers indicating the soldiers of the Sixth Army of the Third Route Army, which is shocking. The ground along the way is mostly alkaline, and the villagers have dug salt ponds to dry and sell small amounts of salt. Upon inquiry, it was learned that the soil here is absolutely unsuitable for farming. In addition to sweeping salt earth and drying salt, they plant fragrant willow to provide fuel. The barrenness of the land is evident. According to the guides from the county government, Lanfeng and Yifeng were originally two counties. The breach of the river at Yifeng led to the merger into one county. The county's administrative expenses are only 702 yuan per month. Most of the county has this type of soil. Only a small part of the southern territory, in the fifth and seventh districts, can grow wheat, but the amount is also extremely small. After the inspection, we returned to our residence and went to Lanfeng Station, where we saw two cellars of the Yan army generals, one west of the platform and one east of the platform. The one west of the station was extremely solidly built, with wooden beams running across and covered with a large number of earthen bags. It was the residence of Xu Yongchang. The one east of the station was smaller in scale and was the residence of a middle-ranking general. It was said that the cost of Xu's cellar was 500 yuan. The intensity of the Central Army's aircraft activity can be seen from this. According to Chen Zhaoran, the head of the Xuwanzihui Rescue Team, the work of burying corpses between Lanfeng and Neihuang has not yet been completed. According to the investigation, the Feng and Jin armies relied on these solid fortifications to defend as hard as they could, while the Central Army often charged towards the battle trenches with bayonets, breaking through their electric nets and deer sheds, and rushing to the battle trenches. When the Feng army's machine guns opened fire, the Central Army jumped into the battle trenches and climbed up the fortresses. The Feng army threw grenades down with their hands. Because of this, there were many sacrifices, but the morale of the Central Army was not diminished at all, and they finally won. At present, malaria is prevalent in the countryside. Each village needs 170-80 bags of rescue medicine, which is almost the case for every village. It is truly a great calamity.</p>

<p>The Opening of the Appeal in the Sino-Foreign Lawsuit: In 1927, the British firm Xiangmao Foreign Firm, located at No. 2 Guangdong Road, Shanghai, had Bian Xiaoqing, the vice president of the Nanjing Xiaguan Chamber of Commerce, who, entrusted by the Zhili-Shandong army, ordered 30,000 bags of Saigon rice from Yang Huanqing, the firm's resident manager in Nanjing, to be used as military rations. He immediately remitted the money through the Nanjing Zhongjiao Banks. However, as the revolutionary army approached Nanjing, Bian went to the Zhongjiao Banks to stop the remittance. He explained to the bank manager that the revolutionary army had arrived in Nanjing, and the Zhili-Shandong army had retreated. He requested the head office be telegraphed to sell the Saigon rice in Shanghai, and he, the customer, would bear all losses. After the bank sold off half of the rice, the total loss amounted to over 110,000 yuan. The firm then sought Bian for compensation, but Bian avoided meeting them. Last year, Xiangmao Foreign Firm filed a lawsuit against Bian with the Jiangning County Government to recover the money. On November 23rd of that year, a judgment was issued, ordering Bian Xiaoqing to return the lost funds to Xiangmao Foreign Firm. After the judgment, Bian, arguing that Sino-foreign lawsuits should be under the jurisdiction of either the Ministry of Foreign Affairs or the judicial organs, hired Zheng Yuxiu, Li Xinyang, and Guo Dingsen as lawyers and filed an appeal with the High Court. They argued that the case should not have been judged arbitrarily by the Jiangning County Government and that the matter was under the jurisdiction of the special municipality. They requested a preliminary judgment on the jurisdictional issue. The appellee, Xiangmao Foreign Firm, also hired Wang Fuchang as a lawyer to prepare a defense. After accepting the case, the High Court, under the jurisdiction of Li Mian, the presiding judge of the Second Civil Division, repeatedly summoned both parties to court for investigation. Yesterday (the 18th), the court summoned An Fo Lai, the head of the import department of Xiangmao Foreign Firm, and Bian Xiaoqing, the appellant, as well as the agents, Zheng Yuxiu, Li Xinyang, and Guo Dingsen, as lawyers, and Baker (a foreigner), the manager of the appellee, Xiangmao Foreign Firm, and Wang Fuchang, as lawyers, to court. Bian Xiaoqing and the two lawyers, Baker, Zheng and Li, did not report. At 2:00 PM, Judge Li presided over the hearing and declared the debate on the jurisdictional issue closed, setting the verdict for the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>The Dispute Over the Public Property of the Chen Hengfeng Store: The Chen Hengfeng Store, located in the Xibaihua Lane inside the gate, is the estate of a prominent Suzhou gentleman, with 2,000 mu of family-supporting farmland. The store manager of the second west branch has been collecting rent to support the poor members of the clan. Cheng Fujin, a member of the clan, recently sought to request the store to make public the accounts of the family-supporting farmland due to financial difficulties.

The prosecutor's office investigated the matter that evening and summoned Xu Xingzuo, the store's accountant, for questioning. Considering the matter a family dispute, they advised Xu Xingzuo to take Cheng Jinpu back and be responsible for making the accounts public in order to be credible.</p>

<p>A Double-Crosser Cannot Escape the Law: A guest merchant, Mei Fengjin, has been trafficking red pills for a living. Recently, he entrusted Fu Arong (also known as Crippled Arong), who lives at No. 61 Zhongzheng Road, to go to Shanghai and bring back a large batch of 88,000 red pills, worth five or six hundred yuan. However, Arong swallowed all the pills. When Fengjin found out, he negotiated with Arong. Arong, feeling guilty, fled to Shanghai. Around midnight the night before, Arong returned to Wuxi from Shanghai and stayed with his wife, Gu, at the Su-Xi Hotel on the road. Coincidentally, Inspector Wang Xiezong of the Public Security Bureau was inspecting rooms there and caught sight of Arong. He immediately reported to Inspector Hu, who reported to Director Xu of the Public Security Bureau. Director Xu immediately dispatched detectives Shen Minhua and Tang Yaoting to assist in the arrest. Arong and his wife, Gu, were both arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. Unexpectedly, when they were being escorted to the intersection of Zhongzheng Road, Gu, Arong's wife, injured Detective Tang Yaoting's head and wrists and lost a flashlight. Fortunately, the police officers at the post assisted in sending the Arong couple to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, Director Xu transferred them to the county government for legal action.</p>
<p>The Water Police District Dispatches Warships to Strictly Guard Against Lake Bandits: Mao Mujun, the chief of the Second District of the Waterborne Provincial Public Security Team stationed in Wuxi, because Taihu Lake has always been a den of bandits, and the East and West Mountains and the Three Mountains are the easiest places for bandits to gather. Now that it is winter defense season and public safety is important, yesterday he instructed Tang Peng, the captain of the Zhaowu warship, to set sail for the area to patrol.</p>
<p>Four People Released in a Kidnapping Case in Two Townships: On the 6th of this month, Dengjiawan and Xiaoqiaotou, two towns bordering the Second District (Jingyun City) and the Twelfth District (Taibo City) in this county, were searched and robbed by bandits, who kidnapped seven men and women. Except for Ling Renda and Ling Baoxian, who were released earlier, the others have not yet been released. The victims' families received letters from the bandits demanding a ransom of 250,000 yuan. After repeated negotiations, the price was reduced to 110,000 yuan, but no results have been achieved. It is now learned that four of the five hostages were released yesterday. The remaining one will be released after the conditions are agreed upon. In addition, Feng Yuequan, the fifteen-year-old son of Feng Yunsheng, the deputy head of Shuiqu Township in the Fourth District (Kaiyuan Township), was kidnapped by bandits at midnight on the 24th of last month. More than two weeks have passed since then. A letter was received from the bandits the other day, stating that the hostage is now in a certain place in Jiangyin. They demanded that he be taken for negotiation immediately and demanded a ransom of 10,000 yuan. After receiving the letter, Feng Yunsheng immediately sent someone to negotiate with the bandits to negotiate the price for the ransom.</p>
<p>The Urgent Need to Install Telephones in the Four Townships: Yao Dixing, the director of the Wuxi County Construction Bureau, previously initiated the installation of telephones connecting the four townships to the city to facilitate communication between the city and the countryside. He prepared a plan and budget and submitted it to the county government for forwarding to the Department of Construction for approval. However, due to the lack of approval, it was not implemented. Recently, Director Yao has repeatedly received letters from various district offices, requesting that the township telephone system be installed according to the original plan in order to facilitate communication. After receiving the letters, Director Yao believes that it is indeed necessary to install telephones in the four townships. Therefore, he is proceeding with the original plan. The expenses required are to be borne half by the installing townships and districts, and the other half is to be subsidized from the construction special donation fund, following the precedent of subsidizing the long-distance telephone expenses connecting Wu County. Yesterday, Director Yao submitted the plan to County Magistrate Pan for review and forwarding to the Department of Construction for approval.</p>

<p>The Director of the Naval Affairs Office Was Kidnapped: Mao Youlan, a native of Fujian, resided under the Huaihua tree on the north bank of Jiangbei in this city. He was appointed by the Ministry of the Navy as the director of the Xiangshan Office to manage the leasing of official naval land in Xiangshan Port. Every year, he went to Xiangshan Port to collect rent in the morning and evening during the rice harvest season and at the end of the year. On the 7th of this month, Mao went to the area to collect rent as usual because the early rice had already been harvested. He stayed at a friend's house there. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 11th, more than a dozen pirates suddenly arrived, speaking in a mixture of Ningbo and Taizhou dialects. Each held a quick-firing gun and rushed in, taking Mao away without a trace. Mao's family only learned of the incident the day before yesterday. They went to Xiangshan to investigate and telegraphed the Shanghai office of the Ministry of the Navy to issue an order for rescue.</p>
<p>Extorting Money Under False Pretenses: Those Responsible Are Beaten with Military Sticks: Four people, Zhang Zhong, Cai Peiliang, Li Boyun, and Fu Dinghua, posing as recruiting officers, forcibly conscripted farmers in Lujiabu, Cixi a few days ago, extorting 30 yuan from each person for redemption. The deception was exposed, and the people there reported it to the county government. Zhang Zhong and the other three were arrested and sent to the Ningbo Command Headquarters. After interrogation, the suspects confessed. They were each beaten with dozens of military sticks and sent to prison for strict punishment.</p>
<p>Bandit Gangs Gathered in Fuzhu Ridge: Fuzhu Ridge in Fenghua is located in a remote area, with high mountains and ridges, and is adjacent to the three counties of Xinchang, Shengxian, and Ninghai. As a result, bandits often come and go there. Recently, it was learned that three gangs of bandits from the neighboring counties of Xinchang, Shengxian, and Ninghai, totaling about three to four hundred people, have gathered there. They have repeatedly committed arson and looting. After receiving the report yesterday, the Fenghua County Government sent the Defense Corps to suppress them and ordered the military and police in the city to strictly enforce martial law.</p>

<p>(Zhenjiang Correspondence) The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department's monthly expenditure is more than 360,000 yuan. Recently, the funds for July and August have just been issued. Before the Mid-Autumn Festival, Chen Hexian, the director of the Education Department, went to Beijing with Niu Yongjian in the name of the Funds Management Office to borrow 200,000 yuan from the Bank of China. The bank has contacted the Shanghai head office and hopes to complete the transaction. Because the income from the educational property is deposited in the Nanjing branch of the Bank of China without interest, and the peak season for receipts is approaching, it can be deducted successively. In addition to the 200,000 yuan loan, another 100,000 yuan will be borrowed from various counties, and the office will raise another 60,000 yuan. In any case, it must be issued this month.

<p>▲ Entertainment and Fireworks</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th) was the third day of Fudan University's celebration of its 25th anniversary. It happened to be a Saturday, so from morning to evening, those who drove from the North Station or the Park Target Range were still shoulder to shoulder.

It is hoped that the school's directors will quickly seek remedies to avoid this shortcoming from happening often. After the entertainment, fireworks were set off on the large playground.

<p>丨Five to Two Ratio丨</p>
<p>There were originally two games in the Chinese Football Club Middle Division competition yesterday, but the Tongji University team stated that due to special circumstances, it requested to withdraw, and the Football Club has agreed to the request, so the game between the team and the Youth team was cancelled yesterday. In addition, Aurora played against Trinity at 3:00 PM at the Chinese Football Field. Both sides performed well. As a result, Aurora won by five to two.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Trinity's main general An Yuansheng participated in the football game between Jiaotong University and alumni (An is a graduate of Jiaotong University), so he was unable to serve Trinity. Trinity's strength was greatly affected. However, the other players refused to show weakness. The competition between the two sides was very fierce. Although Aurora won, it also felt very difficult.</p>

<p>The Chinese team, which caused a sensation in Shanghai and won the championship for two consecutive years in the International Race Walking Competition, in order to maintain its past glory in this year's competition, which will be held on December 7, had to prepare for it in advance and engage in practice. It was decided to conduct the 11th full-course practice tomorrow (i.e., tomorrow morning) at 8:00 AM. Veterans Zhang Zaocun and Lu Yutian will not be able to participate due to business, while Shi Jinsheng, Zhou Yuyu, Hou Genren, Wang Mingzhi, Zhou Shiquan, and new additions Shen Yunting, Le Meigang, Zhang Zhaoqiu, Cheng Xuan, Cai Songyan, Chen Niuzhong, Gong Jintao, Shen Zengjue, Shi Ziqing, Bao Yibi, Liu Jiajun, and He Yu are no less than 20 people, which can be said to be a gathering of talents, making it easy to win the championship. The route of the practice is still the same as last year, starting from the intersection of Tongfu Road and Jing'an Temple Road, passing through Jisi Feier Road, Bairinan Road, Hongqiao Road, Beile Road, LaFayette Road, Albert Road, Foch Road, Tongfu Road, and Weihaiwei Road, directly reaching the racecourse, a total of 17 miles, which is about 50 li in Chinese miles. It is heard that the Xie Jin Association has hired a carriage to follow along the way.</p>

<p>(1) Football Five to One Alumni Win</p>
<p>This year, after the graduation of Jiaotong University student soldiers such as Chen Pu, Chen Yutian, An Yuansheng, and Zhou Xianyan, their strength has been greatly reduced. In yesterday's game against the alumni team, they lost to the alumni by two to five. The alumni team has many famous football generals, so the emerging new army was naturally no match. The first half was three to one, and the second half was two to zero. The spectators were all students of the school, brothers and brothers, and they dispersed happily. The lineup of the alumni team is as follows: Chen Ruheng, Shen Guoquan, Zhang Ruiliu, Niu Feichu, An Yuansheng, Chen Pu, Guan Wenjun, (Lu Jicang) Wang Yuankang, Dai Linjing, Chen Yutian, (Shao Leping) Sun Baochang.</p>

<h3 id="e115">The Remote Causes and Recent Consequences of This Aborted Expedition (3) by Yu Hengzhi <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Later, their deputy leader, Mr. Yu Juxian, published three reasons why South China refused to allow its players to participate. He said: (1) The organization is not transparent; (2) The procedures for contacting players are not proper; (3) The finances are not abundant. These three understandings seem very accurate, but in my opinion, they are all excuses. First, he said our organization is not transparent. I say our organization is too transparent, and our shortcoming lies in being too transparent. Because if we had consistently used the name Lehua and relied solely on Lehua's strength to deal with it, although the name would be too narrow and the strength weaker, we would not have relied on external parties and would have been smooth sailing and unhindered. If Mr. Yu says that the meaning of transparency is to push the matter to the Sanhua Association for joint management, then I feel it would be even more harmful, and the consequences would be even more unimaginable. This is because I have always known that the two Chinese associations in Hong Kong and China are incompatible. Usually, when Hong Kong and China encounter team selections for foreign affairs, many unnecessary disputes arise over the number of attendees. Such trivial matters have already occurred. How much noise would there be for an expedition? Second, he said that the procedures for contacting players were not proper. We followed the precedents. I remember that there wasn't even a single notice during the Australian tour. Although the players belonged to one association, if they were amateur athletes, they had the right to freedom, and the association could not control and manage them. Commercial procedures are a step to infringing on the rights of amateur players and polluting their personality. Moreover, South China has previously asked Lehua's Zhou, Chen, Dai, and Li to help them, but there has never been any verbal or written notice or consultation. If Lehua's procedures are improper, South China's procedures are even more unspeakable, Mr. Yu. The facts are obvious. I don't think you will have forgotten it. Third, he said that Lehua's finances were not abundant, which is even more nonsense. How did Mr. Yu know enough about our financial situation to dare to make such a judgment? As I said above, our expenses and deposits were sufficient to offset each other, and we were also careful to prepare for unexpected needs. How could we have risked going ahead without any idea? Mr. Yu is too much of a worrier. Forget it. Only you can know your own actions. I hope that everyone can treat each other with sincerity in the future and not use words to cover up because covering up is only temporary and ultimately does no good.</p>
<p>Many people are puzzled and looking for the following two answers: (1) Why doesn't the Hong Kong Association agree? (2) Why are the two Chinese associations unwilling to cooperate? Although I dare not be certain about the truth, I estimate it to be about eighty or ninety percent. The Hong Kong Association's annual income relies entirely on the Chinese team. If the Chinese team's masters leave, it will definitely affect its economic position. Recently, its means of ruling that Cao and others are not allowed to participate is to take a permanent solution and prohibit Chinese people from daring to try again in the future. As for the two Chinese associations, they want to take care of their own strength, so they have tried various ways to prevent their respective players from participating. In addition, mutual suspicion is also a major reason.</p>
<p>I think the purpose of the two Chinese associations is a big mistake. Because if you want your power to be strong, it is better to send a few people abroad to adopt better knowledge. Competing in Hong Kong all day long will result in very slow progress. The two Australian tours are enough to prove it. As for individual players, except for those who really cannot do it for factual reasons, it is worth traveling with the army no matter what. Those players who promised first and then broke their promises later, although I understand their position very well, I always think that it is a pity and foolish thing for an amateur player to give up his personal freedom and be bound by an association.</p>
<p>Finally, before I finish writing, I would also like to make a very simple explanation to Mr. Xu Zhendong. Mr. Xu has put in infinite thought for this expedition. I am very appreciative of his fairness and enthusiasm. However, there are many errors in what he published, and the facts are far from the topic. He said that the Hong Kong players did not participate because they were dissatisfied with the procedures. I am one of the initiators, so I should be more detailed. In fact, except for only one Hong Kong player who was not contacted because the demands were too harsh and exceeded amateur practice, all the others promised in person and were ready to participate. However, later, half were controlled by the association and half were incited by saboteurs, so they broke their promises at the last minute. As for what Mr. Xu said about insufficient funds and relying entirely on Java to raise the required funds, that is even more speculation. The facts I mentioned above are enough to defend me. I will not repeat them. We did not launch any donations in Nanyang twice, and although the results in Java were not as good this time, we were not blamed by the overseas Chinese. Although there were some complaints from gamblers who were temporarily angry, the vast majority knew our difficulties and forgave us, accounting for eighty or ninety percent. Mr. Xu also said that after we left, no one in the rear contacted the Shanghai General Association. I don't know what Mr. Xu knew that he said that. Before I left Shanghai, I personally entrusted Jiang Daozhang, Wang Fudan, and Wu Bangwei to organize the Lehua B team and participate as usual. However, later, because the expedition was stranded, we returned to Shanghai, and they gave up. In short, Mr. Xu's news is completely contrary to the facts. In order to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world and confusing the public, I hope that Mr. Xu will investigate the truth a little more when speaking in the future. If Mr. Xu still has anything unclear, I am also very happy to explain it in detail.</p>
<p>In the end, the rights and wrongs of the Chinese people can only be clarified among the Chinese people. It is better to mention less in English newspapers, because debating about the affairs of the Chinese people in English newspapers is not something we are optimistic about and willing to do. (The End)</p>

In addition, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works and the Municipal Women's Association and others sent wreaths, which were displayed in front of the statue. Various levels of Party departments also sent elegiac couplets. The entire hall was arranged in a solemn and respectful manner. Looking up at the portrait of President Tan, it still seemed as if he were alive, which made people stand in awe and respect. From 9:00 a.m., all the staff of the Party Department and the various district Party departments and district branches sent representatives to pay their respects one after another. Various institutions and organizations, such as the Municipal Government, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, the Telephone Bureau, the Municipal Bureau of Finance, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, the Municipal Bureau of Health, the Municipal Bureau of Port Affairs, the Telegraph Bureau, the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, the Municipal Bureau of Public Security, the Municipal Bureau of Land, the Municipal Bureau of Education, the Municipal People's Association, the China Law Society, the Municipal Women's Association, the Jingwu Association, the Rongkang Workers' Association, the Nanhua Workers' Association, the Jianbu Workers' Association, the Commercial Press Labor Union, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Flannelette Labor Union, the China Merchants Bureau, the Arsenal, and the Tea and Snack Labor Union of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway also sent personnel to pay their respects until 4:00 p.m. It was said that representatives were still going to pay their respects.</p>

Many representatives from the Party departments of various ships stationed in Shanghai and Party departments at all levels attended.

It is reported that the three representatives have already gone to Beijing last night to prepare to participate in the public memorial service of the mass organizations of various provinces and cities on the afternoon of the 19th. The Chamber of Commerce has also prepared a special memorial oration as follows: On the 22nd day of the 9th month of the 19th year of the Republic of China, Tan Zu'an, President of the Executive Yuan of Chaling, died in office. The whole country was shocked and mourned. On the 19th day of the 10th month of that year, all party and government agencies and mass organizations inside and outside Beijing held a public memorial service in Central Park. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully follows the mass organizations and publicly elects Chairman Wang Xiaolai and standing committee members Wang Yansong and Ye Huijun to attend the memorial service and to express our feelings in the following words: Alas, riding a carp to heaven, the spirit returns to Jiuyi; with labor to secure the country, a hundred generations of ancestral shrines are revered. Recalling the Xinhai Revolution, when Wuchang raised its troops, the disparity in numbers and the difference in strength made the situation precarious. The turtle mountain garrison was lost, and the defense line was suddenly withdrawn. A corner of the country resisted the enemy, and the overall situation was in imminent danger. Hunan and Hubei, like lips and teeth, raised the flag of righteousness, providing funds and shoes in a timely manner. The morale of the army was strengthened, and the enemy's courage was shattered. Continuing the existence and preserving the inheritance, who else but you, sir? The political situation of the world is changing and unpredictable. Only your integrity, sir, has been followed by the Party and the country. The rugged roads of Hunan and Guangdong have remained unchanged through ten thousand changes. Strong warlords have surrendered, and cunning bandits have fled. The stability of the Lingnan region has been established, and the foundation for unification has been laid. With your elegance, sir, you have relied on your integrity to direct and command. The Jiangnan region has been pacified, and a great contribution has been made. The multitudes are looking forward to peace. You, sir, have been in charge of the Executive Yuan, determined to clarify matters, providing relief and gathering the people to comfort the common people. China has been disturbed again, and fierce generals have claimed troops. You, sir, have used your reputation to sit in the capital, providing uninterrupted transportation, and thus pacifying You and Bing. The day of triumph is coming, and construction is just beginning. Relying on you, sir, for the wisdom of Fang Xuanling and Du Ruhui to manage and plan. Why does heaven not pity us? A great star has suddenly fallen. The country has lost its pillar, and the Party has lost its loyal servant. Raising a glass in mourning, our tears and sobs are unanimous. May you enjoy this sacrifice.</p>
<p>▲ Japanese Representative Goes to Beijing Mr. Shigemitsu Aoi, the Japanese Acting Minister to China, received a telegram from the Japanese government yesterday, instructing him to represent the Japanese government in participating in the state funeral of the late President Tan.

His entourage included Horiuchi, First Secretary, Morishima, Second Secretary, and Okada, the naval and military attaché, and three other people. Because the foreign guest memorial service for the late President Tan is scheduled to be held at 4:00 p.m. on the 20th, Mr. Shigemitsu plans to return to Shanghai on the 21st. Furthermore, Mr. Nagai, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of that country, is still staying in Beijing and will participate in the state funeral of President Tan in his capacity as a private friend.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Du Xigui Returned to China Yesterday <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>▲ Opinions on the Naval Examination of Various Countries</p>
<p>▲ Report is Currently Being Organized</p>
<p>▲ Entering Beijing to Meet Chairman Chiang Within Days</p>
<p>Du Xigui, the Special Envoy of the Navy, a naval admiral, who inspected the navies of Europe, the United States, and Japan, returned to China with his secretary and entourage. He left Shanghai on November 10 last year and traveled around the world. His secretary-general, Dong Xianguang, returned to China in May of this year. Du rested in France. On the 18th of last month, Du and his entourage, Huang Xianqi, Chief of Staff of the Mazu Fortress Command, returned home from Marseille on the Japanese ship Terukuni Maru. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday, they arrived at the Huishan Wharf. Naval dignitaries and commanders of various ships gathered at the wharf around 7:00 a.m. to welcome them. Among them were Li Dingxin, the former Minister of the Navy, Gan Lian'ao, the former Commander of the Training Fleet, Chen Xunyong, the current Commander of the Naval Training Fleet, Ren Guangyu, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Shen Deshe, Director of the Aircraft Factory, Wu Zhennan, Director of the Coastal Defense Office, Ma Deji, Director of the Jiangnan Shipyard, Wu Guangzong, Director of the Survey Bureau, and Dong Xianguang, totaling more than a hundred people. After Du and others landed, they took a car to his private residence to rest.</p>
<p>▲ Du's Talk Our reporter interviewed Du Xigui on the ship yesterday morning. Du was full of energy and had a friendly smile. He spoke in detail about the experience of inspecting the navies of various countries and his opinions on future construction. At 4:00 p.m. yesterday, Du hosted reporters at the Naval Social Club at a welcome tea party. The following is a summary of what Du said yesterday, outlining the main points. Du said, "I left Shanghai on November 10 last year and have been away for nearly a year. In June of this year, in Paris, the car we were riding in was hit hard by a freight car, and I was hospitalized for almost three months due to injuries. Therefore, the actual inspection time was only seven months. The competition among the navies of various countries is fierce today, and each country has its own strengths. England, established as an island nation, has the most complete and well-organized navy due to its environment, and it can be called the sole hegemon. Secondly, Japan's perseverance and hard work in managing the navy for thirty years has already become a great sight to behold. Then, the United States is known for its wealth, France is known for its aviation industry, and Italy's naval schools focus on horsemanship. Although Germany is oppressed by various countries and its armaments are restricted, its navy is gradually recovering and is able to change its policies. The whole country, from top to bottom, advocates sports, and even laborers are forced to join sports associations to temper their martial spirit and create their qualifications as a military nation. Its perseverance is truly admirable. Seeing the surge in maritime power, the powers have limited it through the London Naval Treaty, but the result has failed to fully satisfy people. Recently, the competition between France and Italy has been particularly fierce, and its effects can be seen at a glance."</p>

<p>▲ Naval Construction As for our country's navy, it is extremely young and cannot be compared with Europe, the United States, and Japan. Even in terms of the future construction of our country's navy, it is by no means a local issue. It is not easy to succeed until the national political economy and other matters are evenly developed. Naval construction requires a lot of money, and it is by no means possible to buy a few ships with hundreds of thousands of dollars. Therefore, if there is no sufficient financial guarantee and there is a continuous source, then is it better to dig meat to mend sores? Therefore, the first priority should be political prosperity, and then financial prosperity, before we can talk about the true construction of the navy. In terms of the current situation of China's naval construction, if we can move forward and not retreat in the future, then it will take another ten years to achieve great success. Several British and Japanese naval instructors have now been hired to come to China to develop naval education.</p>
<p>▲ Organize the Report Du also said, "I plan to compile a large book of reports based on what I have learned from this inspection. Dong Xianguang will compile and organize it, and it can be printed and published in about two or three months. Regarding my opinions on the current rectification of the Chinese navy, I have divided them into three strategies: upper, middle, and lower. I respectfully prepare for the National Government to adopt them. Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan will come to Shanghai from Beijing tonight because he is participating in the public memorial service for President Tan. After I meet with him, I will go to Beijing immediately to meet Chairman Chiang and report everything that has happened." Du was quite sharp in his remarks and spoke eloquently. He paid particular attention to the promotion of public sports. What is recorded now is only a tenth of it.</p>
<p>▲ Welcome Tea Party At 3:30 p.m. yesterday, more than a hundred people from the naval community in this city, famous people from Fujian Province in Shanghai, and relatives of Du gathered at the Naval Social Club on Ma Hoke Road to hold a grand tea party to welcome him. First, Major General Gan Lian'ao gave a welcome speech on behalf of Admiral Li Dingxin, in which he briefly stated, "General Du was sent to Japan and various countries in Europe and America last year by order of the National Government to inspect the naval situation and aviation affairs. It has been a year since he went abroad. What he has learned from this inspection will definitely make a great contribution to our country's naval community in the future."</p>
<p>▲ Main Points of the Reply Then, Du replied, briefly saying, "Brothers were sent to Japan and various countries in Europe and America last October by order of the National Government to inspect the navy. I am grateful for the send-off from all of you. Today, when I return home, I am grateful for the welcome from all of you present. I express my sincere gratitude and thank you for your kindness. What I have learned from my travels to Japan and various countries in Europe and America has been compiled into a book by Secretary Dong Xianguang and others. Today, I would like to report to you my impressions of what I have learned from the inspection. I studied in Europe for five years and graduated with considerable results. Now, science is flourishing, and research and academics are becoming more and more difficult. Students from various countries entering naval schools must graduate from middle school and then undergo years of specialized study before they can get a glimpse of the doorway. Many university graduates and graduates of general schools also join the navy and receive in-depth training, so talents emerge in large numbers. In recent years, our country has been plagued by internal strife, and the government has had no time to take care of the navy, which is a great pity. Now, if we want to reorganize the navy, the first thing we must do is raise sufficient funds, and the second is to cultivate talents. Talents and economy cannot be neglected. Although the government has sent naval officers and students to study abroad, the number is very small, and even if they return to the country after graduation, it is difficult to be effective. Therefore, brothers advocate that we hope that the government will set up more naval schools, recruit naval professionals, hire foreign professors, and proceed step by step, so that we can achieve good results in the future. In short, the country should not rely entirely on armaments. Even if there is a very powerful and very strong army and navy, if the opinions of all parties are divided, the strength will be weakened. The failure of various undertakings is also due to selfishness. People in the army and navy only know about their own interests and do not know about the country's army and navy. Therefore, the strength of the army and navy can only be seen to be scattered and declining, and cannot be concentrated and strengthened. The capacity of the Chinese people is too narrow, and their jealousy is too heavy. As a result, all things fail. Therefore, when it comes to construction, the first step is to transform the selfish mentality of the people, so that the majority can take care of the interests of the public, and then unite and cooperate to build a new China. It is not only the development of the navy that is involved." At about 5:00 p.m., they took photos and dispersed happily.</p>

<p>Recently, the various transit companies of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway have been extremely crowded with passengers and goods, and the goods piled up at the various stations such as the Maigen Road Station in Shanghai are like mountains, all because the Railway Bureau lacks vehicles and cannot load them. Various merchants have urged the various carriers to speed up the loading and transportation of the goods to avoid long delays and losses. Therefore, the various companies convened their colleagues at the Transport Company to discuss remedial measures and resolved to telegraph General Commander Chiang, ordering him to quickly release the military vehicles that had been detained for transportation, so as to avoid commercial difficulties. The original telegram from the Association to General Commander Chiang is recorded below: Nanjing, General Commander Chiang, please be informed that the various companies of the same industry have stated that Shanghai Station has recently accumulated 2,800 tons of goods, which cannot be delivered due to the lack of vehicles. All the vehicles at the various stations have been detained in Nanjing with military supplies, about a hundred vehicles in total, stored in the vehicles as warehouses without unloading, etc. It is reported that military affairs are being pacified, and all industries are in the process of importing and transporting goods and starting business. It is difficult to obstruct and detain vehicles. Military use is important, but people's livelihood should also be taken into account. I respectfully request that you telegraph your subordinates, ordering that all loaded trains be unloaded as soon as they arrive, and order the Railway Bureau to quickly return the empty vehicles to the various stations with goods to meet the transportation needs and take care of people's livelihood. It is hoped that this will be implemented and will be a great blessing. Shanghai Municipal Transportation Association respectfully kowtows.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Notice of Deferred Payment of Water Rates from the Taxpayers' Association <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association, regarding the uncompleted audit of the Shanghai Municipal Council's water supply, issued a notice yesterday to all sectors about deferring water rate payments. The letter reads as follows: "To all tenants in the Shanghai International Settlement: The water rate has traditionally been calculated at 60% of the house rent, mostly included in the rent by the landlord. This time, the Shanghai Waterworks Company has arbitrarily increased the price by a quarter compared to before. Our association has strongly protested based on reason, and the Chinese directors have striven to argue the case. The company, knowing that public opinion is not to be defied and that legal grounds are lacking, has automatically accepted the instructions of the Public Works Department, inviting representatives from our association and the Real Estate Association to conduct an audit. Our association immediately declared to the company that, before the audit results are available and a price increase is deemed necessary, the water rate should legally be collected at the original rate (i.e., 6% of the rent). If a price increase is later deemed necessary, it will be collected retroactively, etc. The Shanghai Real Estate Association has also published the above information in newspapers. Unexpectedly, it has been found that the Laou Kai Mow &amp; Co. rent collection agency, in its notice to the residents of the De'an Lane property managed for Zhu Yicai, stated: 'The Shanghai Waterworks Company of the Public Concession has decided to increase the water surcharge by 25%, which is 15% for tenants, starting from September 1, 1930. Our agency will also collect this amount according to the conditions stated on the rent receipt. Therefore, starting from September 1930, an additional water fee of 25% will be collected with the rent, i.e., 2 fen 5 li per tael of rent. If the water company increases or decreases the rate in the future, our agency will also increase or decrease it accordingly. In addition to stamping the rent receipt as proof, this notice is specially issued for your information.' Zhu Yicai is the son of the late business leader Zhu Lanfang. At a time when all residents are opposing the water rate increase, he should not take advantage of the water company's price increase by accepting the increase on one hand and collecting an extra 1% of the rent on the other. We believe that this is the agency's own decision. In addition to writing to Mr. Zhu to correct this, we are concerned that other landlords or rent collection agencies may be taking similar actions. Therefore, we are issuing this special notice to tenants in the settlement, urging everyone to refuse to pay the increased water rate or any other exploitative charges during this audit period. This matter concerns the interests of all residents in terms of water usage. Please do not misunderstand. We hope you will all take note."</p>
<p>▲Letter to Laou Kai Mow &amp; Co.: "To the esteemed managers: According to the notice received by the tenants of De'an Lane from your company, 'The Shanghai Waterworks Company of the Public Concession has decided to increase the water surcharge by 25%, which is 15% of the rent, starting from September 1, 1930. Our agency will also collect this amount according to the conditions stated on the rent receipt. Therefore, starting from September 1930, an additional water fee of 25% will be collected with the rent, i.e., 2 fen 5 li per tael of rent. If the water company increases or decreases the rate in the future, our agency will also increase or decrease it accordingly. In addition to stamping the rent receipt as proof, this notice is specially issued for your information.' The De'an Lane property belongs to Zhu Yicai. At a time when we are opposing the arbitrary water rate increase, was this notice issued by your company with Mr. Zhu's written authorization, or was it your own decision? Please provide a clear answer. As for taking the opportunity to collect an extra tael per hundred taels of rent as an unexpected profit, this is not the time to comment, and we will not inquire about it for now. We hope you will investigate and provide a prompt and clear reply."</p>
<p>▲Letter to Zhu Yicai: "We have received a notice from the tenants of De'an Lane, managed by your rental agent, Laou Kai Mow &amp; Co., which states (details omitted). Regarding the Shanghai Waterworks Company's price increase, all residents have risen up in opposition. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has been returning water bills, and the Shanghai Real Estate Association has repeatedly published notices stating that before the audit results are available and a price increase is deemed necessary, the water rate should be paid at the original price (i.e., 6% of the rent). The efforts made by our association and the Chinese directors have been widely reported in the local newspapers. You are undoubtedly well aware of this. We know that you have a fair and just heart and are willing to share with others. This kind of disregard for public opinion in accepting the water rate increase and collecting an extra 1% of the rent is likely not your intention but rather your rental agent's own decision to curry favor with the water company and to further curry favor with you by obtaining an extra 1% profit. The rental agent certainly gains in two ways, but your good reputation will inevitably suffer as a result. This matter concerns the interests of the public, and you cannot afford to ignore it. We hereby request that you promptly stop this absurd action and order the return of any money that has already been collected to avoid arousing public anger. We hope you will understand."</p>

In addition to stamping the rent receipt as proof, this notice is specially issued for your information.' Your association has made great efforts to oppose this arbitrary water rate increase, showing that your industry does not take advantage of the water rate increase to raise rents, which is greatly admired by the public. However, at a time when your association has published notices stating that the water rate should be paid at the original price, we have discovered this acceptance of the water rate increase and the exploitation of collecting an extra 1% of the rent, which is a disgrace to your industry. Furthermore, the De'an Lane property belongs to Zhu Yicai, the son of the late businessman Zhu Lanfang. This action is likely not Mr. Zhu's intention but rather the rental agent's own decision. You should take immediate steps to correct this internationally embarrassing behavior to protect the interests of the residents."</p>

<p>▲Telegram Congratulating Chiang Kai-shek: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Nanjing: We are overjoyed at the victorious return of your campaign. After months of arduous and sleepless efforts, you have achieved unprecedented great achievements, annihilated the last stubborn enemy, shouldered the responsibility for the Party and the nation, and shone with sincerity throughout the world. The realization of peace and the expectation of reconstruction are at hand. The suppression of the rebellion has reached its end. The completion of political tutelage is not far off. This time, the rebellious enemy took advantage of the momentum of construction and feigned concessions. Their strength cannot be said to be weak, and their arguments cannot be said to be unpersuasive, but they were ultimately destroyed in an instant. This is certainly due to the invincibility of our Party's ideology. It is also because our comrades can truly inherit the legacy of the late leader and make it so. We respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you. The Naval Special Party Headquarters respectfully salutes you."</p>
<p>▲Telegram Congratulating Zhang on Taking Office: "The Naval Special Party Headquarters telegraphed Zhang Xueliang on the 16th to congratulate him on taking office, saying, 'To Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang of the Army, Navy, and Air Force: The rebellion of Yan has caused turmoil throughout the country. The Central Government suppressed the rebellion to stop the unrest and launched a punitive expedition for peace. You have upheld the sincerity of supporting the Central Government and understood the difficulties of the nation. Your telegrams to Jiaxiang were well-timed, and your benevolent words benefited the people. The dispatch of troops from Tianjin and Hebei crushed the enemy in Hebei, and peaceful unification emerged. We have also heard the good news that you have taken office as Deputy Commander of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, placing the Party and the nation on a solid foundation and putting the political construction on track. We respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you.' The Naval Special Party Headquarters, Xian. Zhang's reply telegram was received, saying, 'To the Naval Special Party Headquarters: Thank you for your congratulatory telegram. I am filled with gratitude and trepidation. My talent is insufficient for the heavy responsibility. I fear that I will fail. I respectfully express my thanks and hope for your guidance. Zhang Xueliang, Qia.'"</p>

<p>According to a report, the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Executive Committee believes that the responsible personnel of the Seventh District Party Committee are suspected of being reactionary. After investigation, it was confirmed to be true. Therefore, the Party Committee ordered all executive and supervisory committee members of the district party committee to be suspended from their duties and await reorganization. At the same time, Shen Zurong was appointed as the custodian of the district party committee, and all sub-committees in the district were notified. All documents and miscellaneous items have been received by the custodian of the district. Yesterday, the 57th Standing Committee meeting of the Municipal Executive Committee decided to appoint Shen Zurong, Diao Qingen, Du Gengsheng, Yu Zhongbiao, and Li Daofa as members of the reorganization committee of the district party committee, and designated Shen Zurong as the standing committee member, Diao Qingen as the propaganda committee member, Du Gengsheng as the training committee member, and Yu Zhongbiao as the organization committee member. It is reported that the appointments have been issued separately, ordering them to take office and take over the affairs as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Pan Gongzhan's Talk on the National Salvation Fund <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>▲Already Handling Labor Affairs in Accordance with the Central Government's Intentions</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited Pan Gongzhan, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Committee, to inquire about the progress of the former Anti-Japanese Association's National Salvation Fund. Mr. Pan replied, "When the Anti-Japanese Association ended and was reorganized into the National Salvation Association the year before last, the collection of the National Salvation Fund for inferior goods was immediately stopped. According to the report of the National Salvation Fund Custody Committee, the total amount of collected and deposited funds was 108,000 taels of standard silver, 115,000 silver dollars, and 110,060 two-five treasury bonds issued by the Jianghai Customs, totaling approximately 380,000 yuan. At that time, the funds were deposited in the silver and money industry, preparing to establish national goods factories and national goods companies. Later, the Central Government designated the funds for labor hygiene and labor education purposes. Therefore, the National Salvation Association, at the time of its dissolution, reported the funds to the Municipal Party Committee for verification. The Municipal Party Committee, in accordance with the Central Government's intentions, decided to allocate all the funds separately to the Financial Committee of the Labor Hospital and the Financial Committee of Labor Education for safekeeping to carry out these two projects. These two financial committees are composed of members selected by the Municipal Party Committee from various sectors of the Party, government, business, and education in this city. All procedures are conducted using a collegial system, so there should be no breach of trust. The Shanghai Labor Hospital has already purchased land and buildings on Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai and has been operating for more than a year, providing treatment to 300 to 400 patients daily. The monthly expenses, in addition to relying on interest from the fund, are still insufficient, and the financial committee is responsible for raising funds. The Municipal Party Committee has also appointed committee members to plan labor education projects, intending to establish compulsory labor schools in various districts within the possible scope of the fund's interest. As for the fine yarn factory fund collected on behalf of the Anti-Japanese Association, it is said that fine yarn is a raw material for cloth and sock factories. According to regulations, it could have been exempt from the National Salvation Fund. However, at that time, citizens, recognizing that there were no fine yarn products in the country, collected the fine yarn factory fund at the request of the dyeing and weaving industry, and the dyeing and weaving industry issued receipts for special storage, designated for the purpose of establishing a fine yarn factory, and not as ordinary national salvation funds. When the National Salvation Association was reorganized, the collection of this fine yarn fund was also stopped. The total amount collected was probably between 500,000 taels. Representatives from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang cotton weaving industry associations and the Anti-Japanese Association jointly appointed a custody committee to be responsible for safekeeping. Later, the Jiesheng Yarn Factory Preparatory Committee was organized, notifying all factories that had paid the fine yarn factory fund to exchange their fund receipts for Jiesheng Yarn Factory stock receipts, and to organize a joint-stock limited company according to law. This method was reported to the Municipal Party Committee for record. However, the fine yarn factory fund was kept by the Jiesheng Yarn Factory Preparatory Committee and was not submitted to the Municipal Party Committee for transfer. Therefore, it is not an ordinary national salvation fund and is different from public funds in nature. It is reported that the yarn factory has already convened an inaugural meeting, elected directors, and purchased factory land and machinery. The factory buildings are also under construction. They are currently preparing documents to submit to the Bureau of Social Affairs and forward to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval to register the company."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, together with the Baoshan County Government and the County Finance Bureau, jointly issued a notice yesterday urging the payment of overdue land taxes from the 16th year. The notice is recorded below: "Notice of Joint Announcement: Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau's previous joint announcement with the County Government Finance Bureau urging the payment of land taxes and other items for the 16th year of the former area of Baoshan County that had been incorporated into the Shanghai Municipal District, the Party Department of the 8th District of the Municipality had a misunderstanding due to a lack of clarity about the exemption. Later, the County Government submitted a report to the Shanghai Municipal Government, which stated in Directive No. 7064, 'The report is noted. Since the aforementioned overdue taxes from the 16th year are not included in the exemption, the Land Bureau should be allowed to assist in the collection at any time. As for the misunderstanding of the Party Department of the 8th District, the County should submit it directly to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and forward it to the Municipal Party Department for verification.' Accordingly, and pursuant to Directive No. 6224 of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which stated, 'The report is noted.

<p>▲Dispatching Armed Chinese Police to Guard Day and Night</p>
<p>▲Requesting Serious Negotiations to Argue the Case</p>
<p>The Chengjiaqiao Bridge on Hongqiao Road in West Shanghai, built by the British Shanghai Municipal Council across the border, connects to Sheshan Road and reaches the airport. Recently, the bridge has been in disrepair for many years, and the British Shanghai Municipal Council has dispatched two armed Chinese police officers to guard it day and night. All heavy vehicles are prohibited from passing, so buses are turning around at Chengjiaqiao, which is inconvenient for passengers and greatly affects the company's business. Unexpectedly, it has been nearly twenty days since the dispatch of the police, and no repairs have been started. Wang, the head of the 1st Branch of the 6th District in charge of the area, learned that the land of Chengjiaqiao belongs to the Chinese area, and foreigners should not overstep their authority. Therefore, Wang seriously negotiated with the Jing'an Temple Police Station the other day to withdraw the Chinese police to avoid misunderstandings. At the same time, he reported the details to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and forwarded them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to argue the case and protect sovereignty.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Hankou Cotton Merchants Petition in Beijing <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>▲Cotton Industry Representatives Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>▲Going to Beijing within Days to Request Relief</p>
<p>The cotton industry in Hankou has always been considered important. The cotton-producing areas along the Xiangjiang River and the Yangtze River in Hubei, and Changde and other places in Hunan, all belong to cotton-producing areas. The cotton industry in the port is divided into three groups: the Hankou Cotton Industry Association, which is a group that transports goods to Hankou from various places for sale; the Hankou Cotton Export Merchants Association, which is a group that purchases goods in Hankou and transports them to Shanghai; and the Cotton Industry Guild, which is an intermediary group for buyers and sellers. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believed that Hankou's cotton industry was at the national hub, so it established the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau last year and appointed Xi Jian, Director of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, as the Director of the Bureau. Since the establishment of the Bureau, the cotton inspection has only conducted export inspections and has not conducted import inspections. The standard for humidity is set at 14%. Cotton that does not meet the standard is not allowed to be declared. The unqualified cotton must be re-inspected every three days, regardless of whether it is sunny or cloudy. The certificate is only limited to exports. If the goods arrive in Shanghai, they must still be re-inspected. The cotton merchants believe that due to the climate and geological conditions of Hankou, this standard is impossible to meet except in summer, and not inspecting imports and only inspecting exports makes it very inconvenient for exporters. Moreover, exporters originally use remittances as a tool to circulate funds, but if goods are detained for ten days, then turnover is not flexible, and business suffers even more. This summer, the cotton merchants submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting relief. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce sent personnel to Hankou to thoroughly investigate. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of Industry and Commerce, also instructed the Director of the Bureau to get close to merchants and not to allow policies that benefit merchants to harm merchants instead. However, since autumn, this major inspection issue has not been effectively resolved, so representatives have been selected to go to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to maintain the merchants' difficulties. The representatives arrived in Shanghai yesterday (17th) from Hankou and plan to discuss solutions with cotton industry colleagues in Shanghai within days and then go to Beijing to meet with the Minister of Industry and Commerce to request instructions from the Bureau to exchange inspection methods to provide relief.</p>

<p>In order to audit tax revenue, the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Tax Bureau stationed in Shanghai recently selected Fang Jingcun, Liu Fujun, Hao Zhigong, and Wang Jihou as inspectors, as stated in the original order: "Regarding the appointment of inspectors, it is found that at this time when new cotton is on the market, tax revenue is extremely important, and the inspection and collection aspects should be thoroughly rectified and should not be slackened. Therefore, the officers are appointed as inspectors of this Bureau. They should immediately go to the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th Branches to conduct on-site inspections, stay in the essential places, follow the inspection rules, work hard, and report for verification at any time. In addition to informing the 1st, 2nd, 6th, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 7th Branches, this urgent order is hereby issued, ordering the officers to immediately handle the matter conscientiously and not fail the appointment. This order must be obeyed."</p>

<h3 id="e135">Zhou Changshan Kidnapped <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>▲Kidnapped En Route to Jiangwan Racecourse</p>
<p>▲Bandits Fired Shots, Damaging Vehicle Tire</p>
<p>Zhou Changshan, son of Zhou Xiangyun from Ningbo County, residing at 27 Niuzhuang Road, was kidnapped by bandits at around 6:15 AM yesterday on the west side of the Jiangwan Sports Association. His private car's tires were damaged by gunfire from the bandits. The 5th Precinct, 5th Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau was notified of the incident approximately two hours after it occurred and dispatched detectives to investigate, but nothing has been found yet.</p>
<p>▲Kidnapped En Route: Zhou Changshan enjoys riding horses and keeps several horses at the Jiangwan Racecourse. He often goes riding there every morning when he has time. Yesterday morning, Zhou invited a riding instructor named Wachaliw, residing at 74 Dixiwei Road, to go to Jiangwan together. The chauffeur, Chen A'ming, drove them in car number 8334. As they drove north of the Hechang Oil Factory on the west side of the Sports Association, a car suddenly blocked their way in the middle of the road, stopping Zhou's car from proceeding. It was discovered that the car in front was driven by the kidnappers. Five men suddenly got out of the car. Three of them were armed with handguns and dragged Zhou and the chauffeur, Chen A'ming, out of the car and onto the kidnappers' car.</p>
<p>▲Bandits Open Fire: When kidnapping Zhou Changshan, the bandits fired two shots, damaging Zhou's car's tires. They then put paper-covered glasses on the faces of both master and servant and drove off towards Jiangwan at full speed. Near Zhizhi University, the bandits stopped the car and drove the chauffeur out. Before leaving, they gave him a letter to take to Zhou's family, stating that Zhou was now in the city and that they should rest assured. Wachaliw, the Westerner who was in the car with Zhou, waited for more than ten minutes before the chauffeur, Chen A'ming, ran back to the original location, changed the tire, and then drove back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Reporting to the Police to Arrest the Bandits: The Westerner and the chauffeur went to the Dixiwei Police Station in the concession to report the incident. The police station said that the incident occurred in the Chinese area and forwarded it to the Qujiaqiao Police Station of the 5th District Public Security Bureau. The police station notified the Jiangwan 5th Precinct, 5th Section Public Security Bureau. By this time, two hours had passed since the incident. After receiving the information, Section Chief Dai ordered detectives to investigate, but the bandits had already fled far away and there were no clues. However, it was reported that the car used by the bandits seemed to be number 4120. Zhou Changshan, who was kidnapped, is 30 years old and enjoys sports. In addition to practicing martial arts, he also serves in the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. His father, Xiangyun, has always been engaged in real estate and is well known.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Suicide of a Corps Member Under the Oppression of Life <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>▲ Long Unemployed, Without Any Income</p>
<p>▲ How Can the Whole Family, Old and Young, Survive?</p>
<p>▲ Left with No Choice But to Resort to This Desperate Measure</p>
<p>Following the suicide case in which Wei Yanchang from Hunan and his entire family threw themselves into the Huangpu River due to environmental pressure, it has attracted considerable attention from the public. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 PM the night before last, another young man committed suicide by gunshot on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. The reason for his action was similar to Wei's. The deceased was You Jiaxiang, a member of the 3rd Team of the Shanghai North District Defense Corps, originally from Jiangxi. The situation was extremely tragic. The detailed account of the incident is described as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Family Circumstances: Corps Member You was 38 years old, originally from Jiangxi. He had resided in Shanghai for many years. His parents had passed away early. Currently, his family consists of a stepmother, his wife, Shi, who is 31 years old, and three children: a daughter, Jiazhen, 12 years old; a son, Guanlong, 8 years old; and a younger daughter, Sanyuan, who is just one year old. The entire family lived together at No. 50, Lane 4, Hengyu Lane, Qingyun Road, Zhabei.</p>
<p>▲ Unemployment Experience: Mr. You was an alumnus of Jinling University. He was extremely proud but also very kind and full of ambition. He once worked as a customs broker at Rendek Foreign Firm, and later joined Dachang Trading Company, also as a customs broker. He was known for his competence and was highly praised by his peers. However, when Dachang Trading Company declared bankruptcy due to poor business, Mr. You became unemployed. It wasn't until the spring of last year that he was introduced by a friend to the former Shanghai Baoshan County Defense Corps, 1st Regiment, 4th Team, now reorganized as the Shanghai North District Defense Corps, 3rd Team, at No. 1 Baoshan Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, as a clerk.</p>
<p>▲ Hardships of Life: Mr. You had been unemployed for over a year. With several family members, living expenses only increased, and there was no reliable source of income. Moreover, the position as a corps member of the Defense Corps was completely voluntary. Not only was there no salary, but all transportation expenses had to be borne by himself. As a result, he was struggling to make ends meet. As the suffering deepened, he developed suicidal thoughts. A pessimistic attitude was often expressed. Although he had been repeatedly persuaded by friends, Mr. You had already made up his mind to die.</p>
<p>▲ Attempted Suicide: The tragic scene after You Jiaxiang's death on the evening of the 13th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar this year.</p>
<p>Around 9 PM, he was at home chatting with his wife. Reaching a point of great sadness, You suddenly drew a pistol, intending to kill himself. Fortunately, his wife was quick and managed to snatch the gun away. She immediately ran to inform his close friend and fellow corps member, Bu Li Jing (Mr. You was introduced to the team by Mr. Bu), asking him to strongly advise him. You only lowered his head and said nothing, seemingly having realized his error slightly.</p>
<p>▲ Indeed, a Tragic Death: At 7:30 PM the night before last, You suddenly went to the team alone. He went directly to the room on the upper floor over the street to read the newspaper. All the personnel in the team had already left except for one person guarding the door downstairs in the side room. At 8:15 PM, a gunshot was suddenly heard from upstairs. Realizing something was wrong, the guard immediately went upstairs to investigate. He saw You sitting upright in a chair, his head tilted to the left, holding a revolver in his right hand, blood streaming from the left side of his chest near the nipple. Knowing it was suicide, he immediately reported to Team Leader Mo Huiqing and Deputy Team Leader Zhu Chucheng, who immediately gathered all the corps members to discuss the matter.</p>
<p>▲ Two Cards: Team Leader Mo also reported to the 5th District Headquarters next door and notified You's family. District Head You of the 5th District personally inspected the scene, ordered the local bailiff to report to the court for an autopsy, and found two of Mr. You's personal cards on the newspaper reading desk. One was addressed to his wife, which read, "Dear wife, we have endured hardship together for half a lifetime. I am truly sorry to you." The other was addressed to the colleagues in the team, which read, "Please take care of the funeral arrangements after my death. My family is poor and unable. Team leader, squad leader, and all comrades."</p>
<p>▲ Funeral Tomorrow: At 11:30 AM yesterday, a prosecutor specially dispatched by the court arrived at the team to conduct an autopsy. They found that the bullet had entered the left chest but did not exit. They immediately filled out the death certificate. The funeral was held at 2 PM in the afternoon. The team also issued a notice, the original text of which is recorded as follows: "Notice: Corps member You Jiaxiang of this team committed suicide with a revolver on the upper floor of the team headquarters at 8:15 PM last night. According to his family, this was due to the difficulties of life in modern society and the economic pressure of the environment. Mr. You was very enthusiastic about serving society during his lifetime and was especially diligent towards this team. His performance in defense operations was admired by his peers. Now, he has committed suicide due to the suffering of economic hardship. In addition to our grief, we, his comrades, will come to offer our condolences and escort him to his final resting place, fulfilling the duty of comradeship. It is hereby determined to hold the funeral at this team at 2:30 PM this afternoon. Special notice is given to all members to assemble at the team headquarters fully armed at 2 PM to depart for the funeral. Special notice." At the same time, a notice was issued at the entrance of Hengyu Lane, Qingyun Road, by neighbors Wang Shuwen, Wang Guizhang, Lu Yuxiang, and Zhao Yaowu, expressing their condolences for Mr. You's suicide due to economic pressure and requesting the public to find ways to help Mr. You's family. The words were extremely sad and sorrowful. However, some people said that You spent lavishly and owed more than two thousand taels of silver, and recently committed this desperate act due to the pressure from creditors. However, these are all speculative words due to nervous overreaction. The reason for this misunderstanding is that he liked to wear Western-style clothes when he was alive. As for You's debts, it may be the case, but the amount is no more than one hundred taels of silver.</p>

<p>▲ Kind-Hearted Boatman Brings Him Back to Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ Mother Almost Thought She Was Meeting Him in a Dream</p>
<p>On August 30th, an eight-year-old Russian child, Vladimir, left home with his belongings, intending to go to Qingdao with two young companions by boat. Two days later, the two companions returned home, but the Russian child, who considered himself the first mate, had disappeared without a trace. It was rumored that he had drowned. His widowed mother, Mrs. Rokumsji, with only this one son, was deeply saddened by his disappearance and spent her days and nights in tears. But at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday, Mrs. Rokumsji went out to buy groceries and returned to suddenly find her beloved son, whom she could never forget in her dreams, soundly asleep in a sofa chair. She was initially surprised, thinking it was a dream, and rushed to touch him. It was indeed her son. She quickly took him into her arms and couldn't help but cry with joy. The child was also awakened and cried out upon seeing his mother. Thus, the mother and son, who had been separated for more than forty days, joyfully reunited, and the eight-year-old first mate, with the ambition to swallow rivers and seas, regained the joy of family life. It is said that after being abandoned by his two companions on the riverbank, the child wandered in the villages near Wusong, begging for food to survive. Before long, his clothes were tattered and barely covered his body, so the villagers gave him old clothes. Recently, he was brought back to Shanghai by a kind-hearted boatman, which allowed him to return home.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Two Tragic Accidents in the Huangpu River the Day Before Yesterday <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲ Swiss Man Falls into the River While Drowsing</p>
<p>▲ French Sailor Kicks Boatman into the River, Causing Him to Drown</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (17th) morning, two tragic accidents occurred in the Huangpu River within ten minutes of each other, and the locations of the accidents were less than a cable's length apart. First, at about 3:50 AM, four passengers from the French mail ship "Nusha" went ashore for sightseeing. After having dinner, they hired a sampan to return to the ship. One of the passengers, a Swiss man named Jie Weixie, fell asleep in the sampan. Suddenly, his body tilted, and he fell into the Huangpu River. The boatman urgently called for water police boats to search for him, but his body has not yet been found. He boarded the ship in Marseille, intending to go to Kobe for business. Unexpectedly, joy turned to sorrow, and he was buried in the Huangpu River. Unexpectedly, ten minutes later, at about 4:00 AM, an even more tragic accident occurred. Several French navy personnel were returning to the "Russo" warship in a sampan. When they reached a place not far from where the Swiss man fell into the river, one of them, for some unknown reason, suddenly quarreled with the boatman. He became angry and kicked the boatman directly into the Huangpu River. Afterwards, the water police station searched for him, but they were also unable to find his body. It is now reported that the head of the water police station, Wu Feide, and patrol chief Pu Na, are investigating, and officials from the municipal government have also started an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Family of Missing Elderly Man Scammed <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>▲ Bandits Send Letter Claiming Kidnapping</p>
<p>▲ Two Hundred Dollars Scammed Beside Coffin</p>
<p>Tang Shaoru, an elderly man of seventy-seven years old from Zhangyan, Jinshan, came to Shanghai for business. He suddenly contracted a hidden illness, so he sought medical treatment. His nerves were also disturbed. On the afternoon of the 16th of last month, at about 7:30 PM, he suddenly went missing. The fact that a reward had been offered for his search had been recorded in previous reports. It is now learned that the elderly man has been missing for a full month, and there is still no trace of him. However, his family in the countryside has been defrauded of silver dollars in a kidnapping scheme. The process was quite tortuous and interesting. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Family Situation: Although Elder Tang is old, his body is very strong. He lives in Zhangyan North Street and runs the Tangtai Ji cured meat shop. He has no assets and can barely make ends meet. He has a wife and a son. His wife is also over fifty years old, and his son is only fourteen years old. He had a son late in life and loves him very much. He takes him everywhere. He personally selects and purchases goods for the shop, so he often needs to come to Shanghai. Whenever he arrives in Shanghai, he always stays at a friend's place in the French Concession. He walks briskly on the road and never hires a car to ride in.</p>
<p>▲ Sudden Unexpected Stimulus: In early August, Elder Tang came to Shanghai from his hometown to discuss business matters and stayed at his friend's residence. One evening, while walking along Avenue Edward VII, on the border of the British and French Concessions, he was forcibly pulled away by a prostitute. Unexpectedly, he contracted syphilis. Because of being forced to suffer this hidden illness, his brain was suddenly stimulated, and he was admitted to the hospital for treatment on August 11th, introduced by a friend. As a result, he was depressed and his nerves became disordered. Although the hidden illness gradually healed, his speech was still occasionally incoherent. It was originally planned that he would return to his hometown after a few more days of recovery.</p>
<p>▲ Circumstances of Disappearance: On the afternoon of September 16th, at about 7:30 PM, Elder Tang, who was fond of opium paste, went out of the hospital alone, intending to go somewhere to smoke it. Unexpectedly, he suddenly went missing on the way. When the hospital saw that he did not return, they thought he must have returned home. Later, his family came to Shanghai to visit and learned that he was indeed missing. At the time when Elder Tang left, he was only wearing a double blue twill short coat, willow cloth trousers, white gauze socks, and black shoes. He was bald, his hair was already snow-white, and he only had twenty-two silver dollars, a silver watch, and several hundred copper coins with him, and nothing else. Reports had been filed with various Chinese and foreign authorities, requesting an investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Letter Received Stating He Had Been Kidnapped: Later, the family sent out investigators in all directions, but there was no trace of him. While the family was anxiously surprised, they suddenly received a letter from Shanghai to their hometown at the end of September. It stated that Elder Tang was safe and sound in Shanghai, and that they only needed to prepare 1,500 silver dollars. After the full amount was paid, the person would be returned without fail. The reply could be sent by someone to Shanghai and placed in a broken shoe left on the ground east of the Xujiahui Railway Station. Therefore, the family knew that he had been kidnapped and a ransom was demanded. However, because they were concerned that his old age might lead to danger, they decided to tentatively negotiate.</p>
<p>▲ Process of Negotiation Between the Two Parties: Because people's hearts are treacherous, they were afraid that it was a scam to defraud them of money. So, they wrote a reply, requesting that the other party send back an item of Elder Tang's clothing as proof. As for the amount, they did not have the ability to pay that much and must reduce it. They sent someone to place the reply in the shoe at the specified address. After several days, another letter came, saying that it was difficult to send the item, and used Elder Tang's nickname, "Tang Bench," as proof. His family believed that this nickname was known to few outsiders, so they believed it was true. They communicated and negotiated the amount, and at the beginning of this month, the other party sent a letter, stating that they had agreed to prepare 400 dollars. First, pay 200 dollars and send someone</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>to Shanghai and place it in a broken shoe next to the coffin in a thatched pavilion north of the Xujiahui Railway Road. As for the remaining 200 dollars, they would send another letter in a few days to arrange a place in the concession, next to the Central Hotel, for the exchange of people and money.</p>
<p>▲ Indeed, Money Lost and Scammed: The family naturally felt anxious and hoped for his return, considering his old age and illness. So, they prepared 200 dollars and sent someone to Shanghai to place it in the shoe at the specified address. The next day, the family eagerly waited for a letter arranging a date, so that they could hand over the money and pick up the person. Unexpectedly, ten days have passed, and there is no news. They realized that they had indeed been scammed. But he has been missing for a full month, and his fate is still unknown. The anxiety of his family cannot be described in words.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Young Man and Woman Fall in Love and Rashly Cohabit <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>▲ Both Man and Woman Are Under Twenty Years Old</p>
<p>▲ They Cohabited Soon After Falling in Love</p>
<p>▲ Parents Neglected to Prevent It in Advance</p>
<p>▲ Afterwards, They Reported to the Police Station for Arrest</p>
<p>▲ A Man and a Woman in the Neighborhood: The woman, Qu Xinnan, is only seventeen years old, beautiful, and lives with her mother, Qu Weng, at No. 76, Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, Zhejiang Road. Her son-in-law, Hai Rong, also lives there. There is a man named Gao Yuliang in the neighborhood, nineteen years old, handsome, who has long coveted Xinnan's beauty. In February of this year, Xinnan went out and met Gao, and they became attracted to each other.</p>
<p>▲ Like a Couple: Since then, they have been very close. After three months, Xinnan and Gao's passion had reached a boiling point. So, she entrusted her life to him, and Gao agreed. Xinnan's mother learned of this matter and, seeing that the die was cast, did not object. Gao then acted as if he owned the place and lived unconditionally with the Qu family, living with Xinnan as if they were a couple.</p>
<p>▲ The Good Date Was Delayed: At that time, Gao's father also knew about it and strongly disapproved of his son, severely reprimanding him. Gao, because of his strict father's obstruction, although he intended to marry her, dared not speak. Qu Weng and Xinnan, etc., were quite unhappy because the good date was delayed.</p>
<p>▲ Xinnan Was Expelled by Her Mother: On the evening of the 4th of this month, Gao went out on business. Qu Weng said harsh words about Gao to Xinnan and ordered Xinnan to leave and not return home. Xinnan was very angry when she heard this, so she secretly went out and lived at Room 16, Shanghai New Hotel, No. 249 Guangdong Road. Because her pockets were empty, she borrowed seven dollars from her younger sister, Che Ruiyun, to pay for the room.</p>
<p>▲ Newspaper Statement of Running Away: After Xinnan left, Qu Weng published a statement in the newspaper, saying that her daughter had run away with more than one hundred dollars and gold rings and gold buttons, etc. The daughter ignored this and discussed marriage matters with Gao. Unexpectedly, the matter was discovered by the daughter's maternal uncle, Weng Lyuxi, who found out where the girl was living. The night before last, he reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. The police chief ordered detective Zhao Ziren and Western detective Ge Shi Li to go to the hotel at midnight and arrest the girl and Gao together and take them to the police station, where they were separately detained.</p>
<p>▲ Police Station Sues Gao Yuliang: Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special District Court Criminal Division 1, where Judge Xu Jia Shi and Prosecutor Xu Mei took the bench to interrogate them. The police station lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the police station is now suing Gao Yuliang for the crime of enticing and abducting a man and a woman under the age of twenty, in violation of Article 257 of the Criminal Law, to leave the custody of a person enjoying parental rights, guardian, or protector. Qu Xinnan was not prosecuted, so Xinnan only remained in the status of witness. However, this accusation was made by the police station at the request of the accuser. He gave a detailed account of the facts of the case.</p>
<p>▲ Entrusting Her Life: Qu Weng stated that when Xinnan ran away, she also took away gold jewelry and money, etc. Qu Xinnan testified that she met Gao Yuliang in February of this year. After testing him for three months, I felt that he was quite reliable, so in May I entrusted my life to him, and a physical relationship occurred. This time, I was expelled by my mother, not seduced by Gao. When I went out, I did not take away anything. The hotel room rent was borrowed from someone else. My friend tried to find out my mother's tone, and my mother said that she definitely did not want me to go home, and my sister also said that if I go home again, what face would I have? So, I dare not return home. After I was arrested and taken to the police station, I asked to go out to tell his father and discuss marriage methods, because his father must come forward to handle this matter. But my mother and others firmly refused, leaving me detained in the police station overnight.</p>
<p>▲ Gao Yuliang's Statement: Che Ruiyun also testified that Qu Weng did not want her to return home after her daughter went out, breaking off the relationship between mother and daughter. The defendant, Gao Yuliang, testified that he lived at the plaintiff's house for more than a month. This time, I did not abduct Xinnan, but Xinnan ran out and invited me to the hotel.</p>
<p>▲ No Act of Enticement: Lawyer Ru Bao Yi asked Qu Weng whether she still needed to accuse Gao. Ms. Gao replied that she had to accuse him because Gao had seduced her daughter. Lawyer Ru then stated to the court that since the plaintiff still needed to continue the accusation, the police station seemed unable to withdraw the accusation. However, Qu Weng also admitted the relationship between the defendant and Qu Xinnan and the defendant's statement that he lived and ate at the plaintiff's house. Therefore, according to my lawyer's observation, the defendant did not commit any act of enticement and should be judged by the court. Judge Xu Jia Shi verified the testimony and declared Gao Yuliang not guilty in court.</p>
<p>▲ End of the Case: Qu Xinnan was taken back by her mother, Qu Weng. Later, it was heard that when Xinnan and Che Ruiyun returned to the Qu residence, Qu Weng and her younger brother beat Qu Xinnan. Che Ruiyun reported to Chinese detective Qiu En Jiu and has now reported to the Lao Zha Police Station. It is not yet known how it will be resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Visiting the Water and Electricity Plants Requires Listening to the Instructions of Company Employees <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>▲ Wan Bamboo Student Drowns in Pool</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Public Works Bureau Plans to Prevent Danger</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 16th), students from the Municipal Wan Bamboo Primary School visited the inland water plant. A female student, Li Xiubao, accidentally fell into the pool. The pool was more than ten feet deep. By the time she was rescued and brought ashore, she was already unconscious and soon died. The Municipal Public Works Bureau, upon hearing the news, believed it was commendable that students could pay attention to public utilities and visit them together. However, they were saddened by this death. To plan for preventing danger, they specially sent a letter to the Education Bureau, instructing all schools in the city that if students visit the water and electricity plants in the future, in addition to the teachers in charge being fully responsible for protection, they must absolutely listen to the instructions of the company employees and stop moving forward when encountering areas where passage is prohibited. At the same time, they instructed the water and electricity companies that if people from all walks of life visit, they must assign personnel to guide them, and they must first explain the dangerous areas and prevent them from moving forward to prevent accidents.</p>

<p>▲ Fundraising for the Russian Children's Charity School in This City</p>
<p>The Rotary Club of this city will hold a grand dance party on the 24th of this month at the Dahua Hotel on Gordon Road to raise funds for the purchase of a school site for the Russian Children's Charity School. There are many performances, the most important of which is a national flag team. The flags of more than ten countries will be displayed by young women from each country wearing their national costumes, which is enough to arouse the patriotism of men and women of each country and international feelings. The Rotary Club members also decided that all female relatives of the members who can dance will be extended to fill the temporary dancers on that day. Any male guest who buys a dance ticket can choose anyone to dance with, and the proceeds from the dance tickets will be donated to the charity school. The temporary dancer who gets the most dance tickets will also have an honorary award. In addition, there is also a raffle, with each ticket costing one dollar. The prizes are all donated by major stores in Shanghai, including clothing, ornaments, food, and daily necessities, totaling more than sixty kinds, a dazzling array that is beyond enumeration. Therefore, those who attend the party not only have the concept of doing good is the greatest joy, but also have the belief of winning a prize. The price of an entry ticket is only two dollars, so the purchase is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<h3 id="e144">A Lightweight Wireless Machine That Can Be Carried by Two People Appears <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>▲ Produced by China Tri-Pole Sharp Electric Company</p>
<p>▲ Total Weight of the Entire Machine Is More Than Forty Pounds</p>
<p>The China Tri-Pole Sharp Electric Company at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Ferguson in this city has newly manufactured a compact shortwave wireless telegraph. The entire machine is divided into five parts: a transmitter box, a receiver box, a power box, a parts box, and an antenna pole. The parts, such as the antenna pole and transceiver box, are all made of steel bell. The power supply uses dry batteries. The total weight of the entire machine is more than forty kilograms, so it can be easily transported by two people. It is extremely light and convenient. (The picture on the right is a photo of the machine being transported.) It is said that the wireless telegraphs used in various places in China in the past used storage batteries, kerosene engines, and generators for power, so the entire machine was very bulky and could not be transported without a dozen or more people, and the operating procedures were also very troublesome. Now, the creation of this lightweight machine will greatly benefit society. It is said that the company has spent more than half a year of research on this machine and has made more than ten improvements before achieving today's success. The communication distance can reach about one thousand Chinese miles. The China United Wireless Electric Company at No. 3 Museum Road also sells it.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Garbage Incineration Plant to Begin Construction <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>▲ Expected to Be Completed in September Next Year</p>
<p>The disposal of garbage is a major problem in the Public Concession. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Department recently decided to add a Pelmer incinerator in the Eastern District, with a total cost of 365,000 taels for purchasing machinery and construction. Construction will begin this year and is expected to be completed in September next year. According to the director of the Public Works Department, Shanghai's garbage contains too much fresh vegetation and non-combustible materials, and too much water, which is different from the nature of garbage in London and New York. Therefore, the incineration methods used in the two cities cannot be applied. Now, the Pelmer method is popular in South America. According to his opinion, it is particularly suitable for destroying Shanghai's garbage. It also has a cremation room, which can dispose of dead animals. Its capacity is at least 170 tons of garbage per day. According to the Public Works Department, a German and Indfu Nuo incinerator has recently been ordered from abroad, which is planned to be installed on Binlang Road. In the future, there will be one in each of the east and west districts, and there will be no worry about where to dispose of the garbage in the concession.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, in view of the fact that meat products transported from other cities are mostly not inspected by veterinarians, if they are allowed to be transported in at will, it will greatly hinder the hygiene of meat consumption. Therefore, it has drafted ten inspection rules for meat products entering the market, intending to adopt scientific inspection to promote meat hygiene. It is heard that the rules have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and filing.</p>

<p>▲ Ye Caizhen Arrested in Hangzhou</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Court Sends Police to Assist</p>
<p>Xu Zhuoran, an important figure in the Kuomintang, was suddenly assassinated in Xiamen. At that time, Chen Yanxiang, Chen Delin, Lin Luo, etc., were suspected by the deceased's wife, Ye, and were detained by the Xiamen court. However, the main criminal now referred to is Ye Caizhen, a trustee of Jimei School, who was arrested in Hangzhou. Because those involved in the same case need to testify, the Xiamen court sent a letter to the Xiamen court, requesting that a group of criminals be transferred to Hangzhou for transfer of jurisdiction. The Xiamen court sent ten bailiffs, led by a police chief, to escort the three people, Chen, etc., to Shanghai by Guangli wheel. At the same time, the Xiamen court telegraphed the Shanghai Local Court, requesting it to assist in taking them to Hangzhou. Yesterday, when the Guangli arrived in Shanghai, the Shanghai Court sent bailiffs to the China Merchants Bureau Wharf to bring the three defendants to the case for detention, and today sent police to escort them to the Hangzhou Court for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Qingyun Lane White Russian Demolition Case <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>▲ Instructions from Party and Government Organs</p>
<p>In Shanghai's Hongkou Qingyun Lane, the case of the former Chinese manager of New Sassoon, Xing Dingcheng, employing over two hundred White Russians to forcibly demolish houses, rob property, and injure people after failing to force tenants to move out, has been presented by the Qingyun Lane Tenants Association to various party and government organs and the highest-level organs in Nanjing for assistance. The Tenants Association has received the following instructions from various levels of organs: (1) Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs Document No. 4: "Regarding the petition from Tang Huilian and others, representatives of the Qingyun Lane Citizens' Association of the Shanghai Special District, concerning the illegal eviction by the landlord, New Sassoon, requesting prompt protection. The submission has been noted. As this case is a dispute between landlord and tenants, a letter has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government to seek mediation. Please be informed accordingly." This instruction. (2) Shanghai Municipal Government Acting Mayor and Secretary-General Yu Hongjun Instruction No. 97: "Regarding the petition from Tang Huilian and others, representatives of the Qingyun Lane tenants in Hongkou, concerning the violent demolition of houses by the landlord, New Sassoon, requesting assistance. The submission has been noted. New Sassoon's unauthorized employment of Russians to forcibly demolish residences is highly inappropriate. As a lawsuit has been filed with the court, please await the resolution quietly. At the same time, the government will separately send letters to the Shanghai Special District Local Court and the Public Works Department to handle it according to law. Please be informed accordingly." This instruction. (3) Chinese Nationalist Party Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee Standing Committee members Fan Zhengbo, Pan Gongzhan, and Wu Bokuan Instruction No. 52: "Regarding the petition from the Qingyun Lane Tenants Association in Hongkou, represented by Tang Huilian, concerning the landlord New Sassoon employing Russian rogues to violently demolish houses, requesting prompt assistance to resist foreign aggression. The submission has been noted. New Sassoon's actions are highly inappropriate. The willingness of Russian expatriates to be exploited is even more hateful. In addition to submitting a separate document to the central government to prohibit White Russian immigration and sending a letter to the Municipal Government to seriously negotiate with the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, this instruction is issued for your information." This instruction.</p>

<h3 id="e152">A Bizarre Theft Case in Daxiang Lane <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>At approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, a box of leather clothing and miscellaneous silver dollars, worth approximately two hundred yuan, were stolen from the home of the Meng family, the sub-landlord at No. 11 Tianxiang Lane on Rue du Père Huc in the French Concession. The beginning and end of the theft case appear to be quite strange. The details are recorded as follows: The entire two-story building is rented by the Wu family, and the pavilion room is rented by the Gu family, both of whom work in the education sector. The front building on the third floor is occupied by the Wang family, who runs a carpentry business, and the rear building is occupied by the Xu family, who runs a sock factory. The pavilion room on the third floor is occupied by the Shen family, who are residents. However, both the Wang and Shen families moved in yesterday morning. The furniture is all made of mahogany. The lower floor is rented and occupied by the sub-landlord. On this day, because the tenants who moved in were all acquaintances, he specially prepared dishes to invite them to dine together. In the evening, they gathered again until eight o'clock, when he suddenly went out with someone to redeem a box of leather clothing that had been pawned the previous year from a pawnshop near Taiping Bridge. Upon returning, he felt extremely tired from the day's busyness. At about ten o'clock, he went to bed alone. After one watch, it was already past three o'clock. Suddenly, he faintly heard a sound coming from inside the room. Listening more carefully, it sounded like the sound of drawers and keys. Just as he was about to get up to check, he heard the sound of a kitten following one after another. Distinguishing carefully, it seemed not like a real cat, and he couldn't help but be surprised and puzzled. He immediately sat up and tried to turn on the electric light on the bed, but the mechanism had failed. His hair stood on end even more. He rushed out of the curtain and saw a bald, white-clothed, short figure rushing out. He immediately gave chase, but the thief had already rushed out of the door. He thought to himself that he was a lone woman, and the lights in the lane were already off. The night was as dark as ink. There was no police whistle, and he felt even more afraid to give chase. He had no choice but to retreat to the living room. When he turned on the light, he saw clothing scattered all over the floor. The drawers of the large cabinet were also moved out and placed upside down in the courtyard. Miscellaneous items were scattered. The boxes and chests in the room had all been moved. The leather clothing that had been redeemed that evening had all disappeared. He then cried out loudly, "Catch the thief! Catch the thief!" The neighbors were all awakened. At first, they thought it was a fire, and they all gathered to ask what had happened. At this time, the watchman and the water worker also arrived. They immediately investigated and found that the thief had entered and exited the lane through the large iron gate, which had been damaged beforehand. Then, he pried open the front door of the house to enter. According to the lane, the south side is directly connected to the general lane of Hengqing Lane. The watchman locks the front and rear iron gates every night at six o'clock and twelve o'clock and then patrols the old Tianxiang Lane on Beller Road. Therefore, the front door inside the lane is not often visited at night. Upon careful examination, the thief seemed to be quite familiar with the situation in the lane and knew the events of that evening in advance. Every step was prepared. Afterwards, the patrolman found a lost bill of lading, clothing, and copper items outside the iron gate on the west side of the road and returned them to their original owners. Afterwards, the victim issued a loss report to the Lujiawan Police Station in the jurisdiction for investigation. The head detective immediately ordered an investigation. It was also found that the front doors of No. 6 and No. 12, which are opposite the back door of the house and next door to the west, were also pried open at the same time, but they did not enter. Only this house was stolen, which makes it even more strange, it is said.</p>

<p>At approximately 4:00 PM yesterday, a female beggar, approximately twenty years old, collapsed and died at the entrance of Shenping Lane on the western part of Rue du Consulat in the French Concession. Fellow beggars distributed money to shops and residents in the area to purchase paper money for burning. The patrolling police reported the incident to the police station, which notified Tongren Fuyuantang to send workers to collect the body in a coffin, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Fire on Datong Road, Zhabei <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>On Datong Road in Zhabei, near the intersection of Yongxing Road west of the Sun Temple, there is a vacant lot of approximately four mu, entirely covered with makeshift thatched huts, inhabited by laborers, approximately eighty or more rooms. Yesterday at 1:10 PM, one of the households, for unknown reasons, suddenly became careless. Because straw is easily combustible, and the west wind was very strong at the time, the fire spread rapidly and fiercely, consuming everything in its path. More than twenty thatched huts were completely destroyed. Fortunately, firefighters from various sections arrived and bravely poured water, preventing the fire from spreading completely. It was extinguished at 2:30 PM. After the fire started, the Fourth District Headquarters ordered the police to cooperate with the police officers from the Sun Temple Police Station to maintain order and arrested three suspects: Shi Xiubao, 42 years old, from Yancheng; Zhang Zhu, 25 years old, from Dongtai; and Teng Fan, 53 years old, from Yancheng. However, during the interrogation, each denied responsibility. Approximately fifty households were affected by the disaster, none of whom were insured. As autumn is ending and the weather is getting colder, it is pitiful that they have lost their homes. It was also reported that when the fire was raging, Gu Zhu tried to enter the house to move belongings and suffered burns to his left arm and slight injuries to his face, but he was not seriously injured.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Poor Couple Hang Themselves Due to Poverty <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Han Kezi, a man from Jiangbei who lived in a thatched house at No. 24 near the Gongyi Yarn Factory on Route Robison in the western part of Shanghai, worked as a rickshaw puller. His wife, Zhang, had been ill for a long time, and they had no money for medical treatment. Overwhelmed by poverty and illness, she became resentful and filled with bitterness, leading her to contemplate suicide. Last night, while her husband was out pulling a rickshaw, she hanged herself with a belt. Although Han returned home and discovered it, he had no money for a coffin. The body lay exposed for two days and nights. Yesterday, the Sixth District Public Security Bureau learned of the situation and notified the local bailiff, who reported it to the local court. In the afternoon, a prosecutor and others were dispatched to the scene to confirm the death. Because the family was unable to afford a coffin, the court ordered the charity to provide a coffin and collect the body.</p>

<p>▲Ningxing Not Sailing: The Taigu's New Beijing ship, due to damaged machine leaves, had stopped sailing once. It has now been repaired and set sail. However, the Sanbei Company's Shanghai-Ningbo liner Ningxing was also temporarily suspended from going to Ningbo yesterday due to damaged engine parts that needed repair. Passengers on the ship were all transferred to the Zhaoshang's New Jiangtian to Ningbo.</p>
<p>▲Japanese Ships on the Yangtze: This year, the number of Japanese ships on the Yangtze River going directly to Japan has decreased by one-third due to a reduction in exports of rapeseed, wheat bran, and other goods compared to last year. Therefore, the Yangtze River ships of the Near Seas Postal Society have recently changed their routes and are also traveling to various ports in Beiyang. The Yangtze River ships of the Kawasaki Company have also been withdrawn and diverted to the Tianjin route due to the scarcity of cargo to and from.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Stamp Duty on Chamber of Commerce Membership Certificates <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>▲Not Specified in the Stamp Tax Regulations</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, stating: "Regarding your letter stating that membership certificates of trade associations should be subject to stamp duty in accordance with the example of members of the Chamber of Commerce, which has been approved by the Ministry, please note and forward to all trade associations for compliance, etc. The main point of this case is that the Stamp Tax Regulations are decided by the Central Political Conference and have the nature of law. Since there is no provision in the regulations for the affixing of stamp duty to membership certificates of the Chamber of Commerce, according to the principle that orders cannot contradict the law, taxes not specified in the regulations cannot be forcibly imposed on the people. Furthermore, according to the original text of the Ministry of Finance's Document No. 13865 to the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry has not raised the issue of lawyer membership certificates being subject to stamp duty in accordance with the membership certificates of the Chamber of Commerce, but only stipulated that contracts and receipts should be subject to stamp duty and requested notification for compliance. This shows that the Ministry of Finance originally had no regulations regarding membership certificates of the Chamber of Commerce and has tacitly acknowledged that orders cannot change the law, so it no longer insists on its previous proposal. People are governed by the law and should be treated equally regardless of their class. How can lawyers be exempted from extra-legal taxes, while merchants can be subject to stamp duty by a ministerial order at any time outside the regulations? Therefore, our Chamber believes that the affixing of stamp duty to membership certificates of the Chamber of Commerce should also be done as claimed by the Zhejiang Stamp Tax Bureau, only after supplementing and revising the Stamp Tax Regulations. This is not only true for membership certificates of various trade associations. Accordingly, we have prepared a letter to provide a detailed reply for your review."</p>

<p>▲Allowed to Reopen Only After Fulfilling License Conditions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at the board meeting of the Public Works Department the other day, Chief Executive Edward stated that the arrangement and equipment of the National Goods Emporium in the old Municipal Hall failed to comply with the conditions listed in the Public Works Department license, which would be extremely dangerous in the event of a fire. After deliberation by the directors, it was considered that if the emporium unfortunately caught fire, the Public Works Department would bear significant responsibility. Therefore, although some directors advocated extending the deadline for a few more days, ordering the emporium manager to complete the arrangement in accordance with the license regulations within the deadline, the discussion ultimately decided to instruct the police to go and order the emporium to close until the indoor equipment could fulfill the conditions listed in the license before being allowed to reopen.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Jishan Society's Recent Relief Efforts for Shaanxi Disaster <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jishan Society in this city recently received a letter from the Chang'an Jishan Branch in Shaanxi, stating that they had received the total of nine thousand six hundred yuan in disaster relief funds and expenses for the disaster relief orphanage, which had been duly received and telegraphed back. The three Wugong disaster relief orphanages were receiving children whose situation had worsened and had no place to seek refuge. The seven and eight months extension had now expired, and the children's survival was endangered. In addition, locust plagues in Shaanxi were devastating crops, filling the sky and covering the land. Although the government had repeatedly issued locust control notices, promoted agricultural achievements, and made every effort to defend against the locusts, the locust damage was too severe, the autumn harvest was hopeless, and the number of disaster victims was increasing daily. As autumn was approaching and the weather was getting colder, winter relief efforts should be initiated in advance, including providing cotton clothing or disaster relief funds. It was hoped that careful planning would be done and attention paid to it early. The branch had distributed approximately 20,000 yuan worth of wheat seeds in the north and south mountains and Chang'an counties, which had exhausted its resources. The disaster victims were pleading and appealing from all sides, which it could not cope with. In the middle of the night, it was difficult to sleep. The pagoda was being built, and the voyage was landing. All these hopes were placed on the general assembly, it was said. It was found that the society had spent a considerable amount of money on disaster relief in Shaanxi in the past two years. Now that the disaster has worsened and the livelihood of the disaster victims has become more difficult, the society is unable to support it alone. Recently, it telegraphed the Shaanxi Society, agreeing to allocate an additional two months of expenses for the Wugong disaster relief orphanage, totaling 3,000 yuan, to be remitted to Shaanxi for emergency relief. Other severely affected areas will still be planned for at any time, in the hope of saving as many lives as possible.</p>

<p>▲Flying Brick Injures Head</p>
<p>Zhu Deben, 36 years old, from Yancheng, earns a living by pulling a rickshaw. Because he has no family in Shanghai, he resides at the home of his maternal uncle, Zhou, at No. 26 Taisen Lane on Ping'an Bridge in the South City, paying a monthly rent of two yuan. However, meals are not included, and he eats at small restaurants every day. Recently, as the weather has gotten colder, Zhu found it inconvenient to buy food outside, so he bought a pot and stove to cook for himself in his room. When his aunt, Yan, saw this, she felt that it obstructed her coming and going and immediately interfered. Zhu then appealed to his uncle, Zhou, asking for his support. Zhou scolded his wife, saying that his nephew was cooking in his room and that she had no right to interfere. They disagreed and a conflict arose. Yan fell to the ground and was injured in the head, with blood flowing profusely. Her condition was very dangerous. She then ran out injured and reported the incident to Chen Jiaxiang, the watchman at the 20th post. Chen took Zhu to the First Section of the First District Police Station. During the preliminary hearing by the station chief, Yan stated that her nephew, Zhu Deben, wanted to set up a stove in her house to cook, but she refused. He then told his uncle, who is her husband. Unexpectedly, he became angry and beat her. Because she was not fully recovered from her illness, she was unable to defend herself. She accused her nephew of helping to commit the crime, saying that her nephew picked up a brick from the ground and threw it at her, hitting her head, causing her to be injured and bleed. She requested a thorough investigation. The station chief, considering the matter a case of assault, ordered a document to be prepared and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>▲Sentenced to Thirty Days of Detention</p>
<p>▲Gun License Revoked</p>
<p>Sun Jingru, the manager of the Xintong Bank on Henan Road, hired three or four bodyguards, including Bai Yutang and Zhang Jingui from Shandong, who were armed. At 9:15 PM the day before yesterday, Sun was traveling in his own car with Zhang and others to see a play at the Rongji Great Stage. While passing on the Fourth Road, a rickshaw pulled by Sun A'er, a man from Jiangbei, was parked on the side of the road, preventing Sun's car from moving forward. At that time, for unknown reasons, Sun and Zhang had a verbal altercation. Zhang took out his handgun, which he used to protect his employer, and fired a shot at the ground, piercing Sun's shoe. Fortunately, it did not injure his flesh. Sun A'er's colleague, also named Sun A'er, stepped forward and restrained Zhang, causing Zhang to punch his face several times, causing him to bleed profusely. Chinese detective Qiu Enjiu, Western detective Gaisili, and Chinese constable No. 2637 arrived and took Zhang into custody. A Mauser pistol, thirteen bullets, one spent bullet, and a gun license were confiscated. Yesterday morning, Zhang was sent to the First Criminal Division of the Special District Court. Presiding judge Xu Jiawei interrogated both parties. Their statements were conflicting. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, requested that the defendant be given a warning and that his license be revoked as he was unfit to carry a gun. He also requested that the gun be confiscated as it was used in the crime. Judge Xu reviewed the statements and sentenced Zhang Jingui to thirty days of detention for endangering life and threatening others, causing harm to their safety. The number of days of detention prior to the final judgment was allowed to offset the detention for one day. The pistol was returned to Sun Jingru for collection, and Zhang Jingui's gun license was revoked.</p>

<p>Sun Fusheng, the former manager of the Huifeng Motor Company below Chunzailou at the Dada Wharf in the South City, had a dispute with shareholders Wang Liqing, Zhang Jinkui, Wu Delin, and others over the division of shares, which led to a lawsuit in the local court. At approximately 4:00 PM on the 9th of this month, Wang and others, accompanied by driver Shi Miaofa and workers, went to forcibly take over. The accountant, Lin Bingkui, from Ningbo, resisted and was beaten. At that time, Lin was terrified, and immediately suffered from chills and fever, developing typhoid fever and becoming insane. Lin Bingjun, his younger brother, seeing that his brother was on the verge of death, immediately carried him to the local court to verify the injury. He verified that he was injured, but not fatally. However, after the injury verification, Lin Bingkui was carried to Nanyang Hospital, where it was determined that his brain and nerves had been subjected to shock and stimulation, and that his internal heart was inflamed, making it difficult to treat. Lin Bingjun then carried his brother back home, where he died at 5:00 AM yesterday morning. Lin Bingjun immediately reported the death to the court. Prosecutor Wu ordered the body to be carried to the court. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, Mr. Wu, because the family claimed that the death was due to injury, ordered bailiff Liu Nanqun to dissect the body for clarity. After a long examination, a section of the small intestine was cut off and sent for examination. The family was ordered to collect the body and await further investigation.</p>

<p>October 14th. The news report in your newspaper regarding Zhao Dingyu, a partner at the Fukang Paper Shop at No. 149 Huajin Road in the city, transporting copper coins, is inconsistent with the facts. We respectfully present the facts as they occurred at the time and hope that you will publish them in the "Letters to the Editor" section for correction. We would be grateful. Upon investigation, on the 14th of this month, our shop sent partner Zhao Dingyu to the Nanshi district to purchase and dismantle copper coins. At the Heshun Paper Shop at No. 686 Waima Road, he inquired and found that there were copper coins available for exchange. He purchased 100 yuan worth of copper coins, totaling 283,000. On the way back in a carriage, while passing through Wanyu Wharf Street, he was stopped by the police from the First District, First Precinct, who suspected him of being a private seller from Jiangbei coming to Shanghai. He was immediately taken to the precinct. Subsequently, the chief of the precinct investigated and determined that he had purchased the copper coins for exchange at the Heshun Paper Shop and that he had made a profit of only a little over ten cash at the current price. The copper coins were then returned to him with a receipt. This matter concerns the reputation of our shop. We respectfully request a correction. Fukang Paper Shop respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted. We have recently read in your newspaper about Fang Shouchun leaving a note and fleeing. It was mistakenly reported that Fang was a partner in our shop. In reality, Fang was a friend of a partner in our shop. He was originally a dealer in southern goods in his hometown of Yuyao. Due to family problems, he came to Shanghai in a fit of pique and stayed at the New Gaosheng Hotel, not on the upper floor of our shop. His uncle, Fang Lanting, works as a teacher at Lao Jiulun, and his cousin, Jie Fu (not an older cousin), works as a buyer of foreign goods in Gujia Lane. The person who reported it to the water police was his cousin Jie Fu and a partner from our shop. It has nothing to do with our shop. We sincerely fear misunderstandings from the outside world and hereby request your newspaper to quickly make a correction. We would be grateful. Respectfully submitted to the editor of Shen Bao. Gongping Sock Factory, October 18th.</p>

<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>Women obtain their self-judgment from the mirror, while men obtain their self-judgment from the eyes of other women.</p>
<p>▲ If the men in the world could put all the energy and courage they use on women into their careers, then the world could have many more millionaires and important figures.</p>
<p>▲ A modern woman will never be afraid when she gets married, because if she wants to marry and cannot be happy, then after a divorce, she can at least taste a little happiness.</p>
<p>▲ Modern youth need a woman who loves him but does not bind him and does not need a wife who can passionately love him but at the same time makes his actions inconvenient.</p>
<p>▲ When a man and a woman are sitting and chatting casually, and the woman hears the man tell a joke and laughs so hard that her whole body is shaking for a long time, then they already have the possibility of getting married. However, the man sometimes still does not understand the reason.</p>
<p>▲ When suffering a huge wound in love, wisdom is a plaster, philosophy is a fragrant oil, and time is a painkiller. Once all three are available, the pain is lost.</p>
<p>▲ Men under the age of thirty-five tremble when they think of marriage, like a dog seeing a rope.</p>
<p>▲ When falling deeply and passionately in love, the capacity to enjoy happiness increases proportionally, but the opportunity to enjoy happiness also decreases proportionally.</p>
<p>▲ If all the women in the world want to stop their husbands from wandering outside and not wanting to go home, you will be greatly disappointed, because this kind of thing is impossible to save, unless it is time, luck, death, divorce, and patience.</p>
<p>▲ Ordinary men find it very difficult to understand the changes in women's psychology, which is as incomprehensible to us as the structure of wireless telegraphy.</p>

<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>I have a friend, Mr. Shen, who has recently returned from overseas, having traveled on the President Grant, a ship of the Dollar Steamship Company. After we met and exchanged pleasantries, I asked if he had any interesting news from the Western countries that he could share with me. My friend said, "There are many things, but let me first talk about this ship. The owner of this ship is Robert Dollar, an American. He originally made his living growing sweet potatoes and had no other property, only two mountains, which were entirely planted with sweet potatoes. Once they matured, he sold them to other provinces. Later, the production volume increased day by day, and sales also expanded. He hired steamships to transport them. At that time, there was only a steamship company run by the government, which charged exorbitant freight rates and increased them from time to time. Mr. Dollar calculated his annual profit and found it to be very small. He realized that his hard work was only benefiting the steamship company. So, he devised a method to resist this. He sold one of his mountains and used the funds to build a steamship. In addition to transporting sweet potatoes, he also carried passengers and cargo, charging lower rates than the government-run company. People flocked to him, and he was overwhelmed with business. He then sold his other mountain and used the proceeds, plus the profit he had made, to build a larger steamship to specialize in the shipping business, no longer being a sweet potato merchant. Years later, with the surplus, he built more steamships. By today, there are branch offices established in all commercial ports around the world. He also established world-class liners to circumnavigate the globe, with a steamship sailing from each commercial port every week. One can imagine the large number of ships he has. Therefore, today's Dollar is truly a giant in the shipping industry."</p>

The study is located in Chenghe Village on Fuxu Road. A corner of a painted building, it is exquisitely elegant. The arrangement of the hall is particularly beautiful. On the wall, in addition to a pair of mandarin ducks, are the honors that Mr. Li has received over the years for his service to society, as well as the scrolls presented by various dignitaries during his wedding. These fragments of silk are precious. The study is located on the third floor, facing a famous garden. Windows on three sides are covered with willow branches, creating a delicate view. There are many books in the middle. There are inscriptions on the Liyun Study and poems exchanged between the couple, which are refined and worth reading. The host is diligent in serving the party and the country, and the hostess is devoted to education. In their leisure time, they play with their young children.

<h3 id="e178">Afterglows Amidst the Celebratory Sounds <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Meiyu</p>
<p>Shou Juan invited me to a feast at his residence, the Juan Nest, on the occasion of the Double Tenth celebration. (Note: Juan Nest is Shou Juan's residence.) The guests included those who had just returned from travels to Europe and the West, who spoke in detail about various friendly countries, providing valuable insights. This gentleman is now recording these insights in daily installments on the left side of this discussion column. I will not repeat them. (Note: This gentleman is Mr. Wang Yachen.) After the banquet at 3 p.m., I drove past the Great World and returned to the Baimao Pavilion for a short rest. Suddenly, I received a wedding invitation. It was addressed with "Tea and refreshments will be served at 4 p.m. on the 13th of the tenth month of the national calendar." It was co-signed by the wedding couple, He Songqing and Li Shuqiu. Below Songqing's name was added the phrase "second son of Yuan Fu." This was a fellow member of the Huiwen Society in Suzhou forty years ago. I went to congratulate him as agreed yesterday. What I saw and heard can serve as an afterglow of the Double Tenth celebration. I record it as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Double Tenth, Double Tenth: The He family rents a house near the old Daoguan Street in the city. The house is still spacious. In the middle of the main hall, a silk scroll is hung high, with the words "Double Tenth" written repeatedly in glittering gold. A guest, dressed in Western clothes and leather shoes, smiled at the crowd and said, "What a pity! The wedding date is three days after the National Day." Another guest replied seriously, "No. There is only one Double Tenth in a year. However, the national enthusiasm has the words 'Double Tenth' engraved in the hearts of the people every day." Xu Geng: During the national music, the officiant delivered a speech, then turned around, pointed to the silk scroll, and said to the guests, "Ladies and gentlemen, do you know the subtle meaning of 'Double Tenth, Double Tenth'? Ms. Shuqiu's age, according to the national calendar, is exactly twenty years old. The initial basis for the love between Mr. Songqing and Ms. Shuqiu began when they were both ten years old. So, I repeat it to clarify it." All the guests applauded. The two guests who had exchanged opinions earlier seemed to be lost in thought.</p>
<p>▲ Seeing Benevolence, Seeing Wisdom: The He family's wedding only served tea and refreshments. The guests did not mind its simplicity. The two newlyweds came out and paid their respects to the guests. The officiant asked the guests to talk about the happy events of the Double Tenth Festival since the founding of the Republic. Everyone presented their views, which were full of patriotic ideas. A female guest stood up and reported, "During the Double Tenth Festival of the twelfth year of the Republic, my husband was in Paris. He fell in love with a dancer in that city. I took an open-minded approach, and my husband loved and respected me even more." The guests laughed. I silently recalled the banquet at the Juan Nest, where I heard that the couple Yachen were admired by foreigners. How could this be compared with this? The same Double Tenth, the two newlyweds and this female guest also have a sense of seeing benevolence and seeing wisdom. I append this as an afterglow to my writing.</p>
<h3 id="e179">A Record of the Shoe-Stealing Rat <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xiao</p>
<p>In our town, there is a rogue named Li. He is from a once-noble family but has squandered his wealth through gambling. He has retreated to associating with vagrants and beggars. He has mastered the art of opening boxes and stealing shoes. He especially likes to steal women's high-heeled shoes. His technique of stealing shoes is unpredictable. Shi Qian and Bai Sheng in the Water Margin are probably no more than that. Because the townsfolk think he resembles a rat, they call him the Shoe-Stealing Rat.</p>
<p>Except for the first and fifteenth days of the first month of the lunar calendar, the Shoe-Stealing Rat steals more than ten pairs of shoes every day. He hides them in the big bucket on the flagpole in front of the town temple. No one knows. Every ten days, he examines all the various cloth shoes and leather shoes he has stolen. Those that are broken, old, or smelly are thrown into the dung pit east of the temple. Those that are intact and new in color are wrapped in paper and taken to the city for sale. In the middle of April this spring, a strong wind blew. The flagpole in front of the temple suddenly broke. The bucket fell to the ground and shattered. The shoes also fell down one after another, like butterflies fluttering. The townsfolk flocked to watch, and they realized that this bucket was the Shoe-Stealing Rat's shoe storage. They sighed that his idea was fantastic and praised it. Because his stolen goods were exposed, the Shoe-Stealing Rat was envied by heaven. So, he relocated and sought another mysterious lair to be his shoe storage.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Gu, the principal of a certain elementary school, married Ms. Shen. Ms. Shen is the daughter of a wealthy gentleman. She loves to dress up. Her clothes are fashionable and extremely luxurious. Even for a pair of shoes, she spends more than ten gold coins. Therefore, she is most coveted by the Shoe-Stealing Rat. She has lost shoes several times in a year. Although she tries her best to protect them and takes strict precautions, it is ineffective. On the night of her wedding, fearing that her gold-embroidered leather shoes would disappear again, she asked a bridesmaid to sleep with the shoe box in her arms, intending to protect them. When the bridesmaid woke up at dawn, she saw that the shoe box in her arms was still the same. She happily reported to the bride, "Miss, you are very lucky. This time, the Shoe-Stealing Rat worked in vain and could not use his skills." The bride was secretly happy when she heard this. She untied the rope and opened the lid, intending to put them on. But the contents of the box were no longer the real thing. Instead, there was a bow shoe only three inches long, like something belonging to an old woman, and it was broken and tattered. Ms. Shen was stunned when she saw this. The bridesmaid, who had the mission of protecting the shoes while sleeping with the box in her arms, was so frightened that she almost lost her complexion.</p>
<p>Also, my relative, Ms. Zhou, once lost her shoes. They were unexpectedly recovered. The matter was quite interesting. I record it as follows. Ms. Zhou went to the city for business. She saw countless leather shoes in a small shop, marked with "Special Discount, Half Price According to Size." She spent three yuan to buy a pair. The shoes were very delicate, and Ms. Zhou treasured them. Less than ten days after returning to her village, she was again targeted by the Shoe-Stealing Rat, and the shoes disappeared. She was distressed. But only one night later, the shoes were suddenly found on the toilet lid. Attached to the shoes was a note that read, "This has passed through my hands. Is it from a certain store?" Later, Ms. Zhou investigated. These shoes were indeed stolen goods, originally belonging to her classmate, Ms. Qian, and were stolen last year.</p>
<h3 id="e180">An Account of an Italian Art Investigation (5) <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>Giotto was born in 1266 and died in 1337. He was a student of Giovanni Cimabue, a great painter of the early Renaissance. He and his teacher were the pioneers of the Renaissance. Giotto was originally a shepherd boy in his youth. One day, Giotto drew a sheep on a stone wall and was appreciated by Cimabue, who then taught him. Later, he became a great master of a generation. Most of the church's artworks are Giotto's religious frescoes. He was originally an interpreter of Christian legends, so his pictures tend to focus on formal depictions. His technique is slightly stagnant, and his perspective is also incomplete. However, the purity of the characters he depicts is better than the later masterpieces of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Few of Cimabue's paintings have been passed down. There are several pieces of his handmade clay relief sculptures in this church. In the early Italian Renaissance, there was a type of clay relief sculpture that is still specially recorded in art history, because there was an amazing skill in clay relief sculpture at that time. Cimabue was one of the first people to invent clay relief sculpture. After seeing Giotto's frescoes, I entered the Crocifisso Chapel. On both sides of the main hall of the chapel are more than ten tombs of famous Italians throughout history. Among them, two tombs particularly caught my attention. One is of the literary giant Dante, and the other is of the great artist Michelangelo.</p>
<p>(6) San Marco Church: There are many frescoes in this church. Among them, there is a picture of "The Descent of the Angel," which is the work of Fra Angelico, a great painter of the early Renaissance. This painting is on the wall of the corridor on the second floor of the church.</p>
<p>Fra Angelico was a religious believer who was good at describing the retribution of good and evil. He was quite famous at the time. His brushwork is extremely strong in the painting, and the color is also gorgeous. In addition to the large frescoes in the temple, there are also pictures of the deeds of Jesus. Each picture is displayed in a small room, totaling more than ten rooms. On the opposite side, there are also dozens of rooms, which contain the frescoes of Savonarola. Savonarola was a great painter after Fra Angelico. He was also a religious believer. His technique is roughly the same. He was highly regarded for his descriptions of Jesus' narrative pictures. His subjects are all inclined to factual explanations.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Tears Stain Her Face, Her Heart Breaks; The Fragrance of Red Lotus Fades, A Maiden's Soul Departs</p>
<p>The tigress has always been mindful in her investigation. The master and the coachman are both under her observation. Gengsheng has never revealed any flaws. Today, because of the three words "First Madam," he was caught by her. At that time, it was out of negligence, and there was no room to maneuver. He simply stammered. This madam is like a female judge at home. She could not bear a few words of rebuttal, which made the guilty person's heart tremble with fear. But she knew that if she asked too urgently today, it would be bad and make the other party wary. So, she stopped asking. Two or three days later, the master really went to Hangzhou. The madam called Gengsheng in and said to him in a kind and gentle way, "You called me 'First Madam' the other day. When I asked you, you didn't want to say. But now I already know. I am the First Madam. It turns out that there is another concubine there. That is the master's business. All the criminals who refuse to confess during the interrogation are using some kind of false story or subtle prodding to elicit a natural confession." Gengsheng was flustered by her false report. She said it was a concubine. In Shanghai, the words "concubine" and "second" sound similar. He mistook her for saying "Second Madam." He hurriedly said, "There is no Second Madam." Madam Yin smiled, "Not only a Second Madam, but also a Third Madam." Gengsheng said, "There is indeed no Third Madam." The madam said, "Then there is a Second Madam." Gengsheng said, "This... this..." The madam said, "Don't this that. The master has told me everything. I am not forbidding the master to take a concubine. I just hate him for taking a concubine but hiding it from me. A man with three wives and four concubines, as long as he can afford it, what's the matter? Now he is hiding it from me, which shows that I am not virtuous. So, I have already talked it over with the master. Since he has taken someone, why live outside? It's better to be lively in the mansion. Why borrow a small mansion outside? You don't have to come back in the middle of the night either. You can sleep earlier and save some energy." Gengsheng thought, "Our master repeatedly told me not to tell anyone at home about his taking a concubine and renting a small house, especially not to reveal half a word to the First Madam. How could he tell her first? She is a famous tigress. I think she used some kind of stomach trick or deception to trick the master's words out. Our master is really an honest and upright person. I'm afraid the Second Madam will suffer from now on." Since the master himself has already said it, why should I hide it from her again? He thought like this, which precisely fell into the madam's plan. As the ancients said, "Although I did not kill Bo Ren, Bo Ren died because of me." The life of this Second Madam was lost because of Gengsheng's thinking. It is truly, "Jealousy and madness, night rain destroy flower buds, leaking spring light has willow branches."</p>

<h3 id="e182">Financial and Gold Markets Surge Strongly <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>▲ The People's Hearts Are Excited and Progressing Step by Step: Yesterday, the price of gold suddenly reached a peak. The rise was fierce, sharp, and unusual, exceeding the 70 tael mark. This was caused by large households resisting short positions and by the forceful rise of forward contracts by powerful bulls. The people's hearts were excited, and even demand was high, while supply was scarce. Exchange rates also tightened accordingly, and the price of gold varied by as much as ten taels. The steps were even, climbing steadily, with only one or two taels of fluctuation. From the morning, it rose slightly. Although overseas silver markets rose, they were not affected, because exchange rates rose back. However, commodities were slightly more expensive and appeared flat. In the future, Yuda, Zhifeng, Yongyuan, Maoyong, and Yongyongfeng had more and more buying interest, and they advanced all the way, showing an image of soaring flight. The price rose sharply by ten taels, reaching more than seventy taels. Only Hengxing, Shengda, Dachengfeng, and Yongyong sold. Foreign exchange rates were adjusted down by half a notch. The spot red bar increased by 18.5 taels. Because it was Saturday in the afternoon market, it was usually a holiday, and the big silver bar is expected to fall today.</p>
<p>▲ The Half-Day Market Rose by Nine Taels: The December gold price opened slightly higher in the morning, at 561.8 taels (gross plate traded around two taels). The silver bar rebounded by one-sixteenth, the silver price was unchanged, the US and Japan added one-sixteenth, and the European market was flat and stable, so the industry's intentions were stable. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of more than one or two taels, falling from 2.12 taels to 60.08 taels. At this time, Yifengyong and hedging companies sold. Suddenly, the buying side became active, and Mitsui traded 1.255 taels for the spot Dalian price, and then added to 2.56 taels. It immediately fell back by 0.78 taels, but it was not too high or low. It was almost the first order to announce that the listing should not move. The time was 62.12 taels, the inside was also flat, Huabi and Zhongxing mutually did 39.625 yuan for Citibank in November, and then Hughson made a few coins. At 9:30, it was 1.8 taels. In a flash, Chunyuan, Yongyuanheng, and hedging companies successively bought, and then the price gradually progressed. The exchange rate was also firm. HSBC issued 39.5625 yuan for Citibank in Shanghai this month, and British and Huabi did 1.75625 British gold in November. At 10:30, it rose to 64 taels, but there were ups and downs of a few coins. Twelve points of sale for the first order in December Huabi Mitsui sold 17 half, and then Yuda, Yuanmao, Yongtai, Hengyuan, etc. followed up, continuing to jump up by three taels, and at about 11:30 it was about 67 taels. There were plate heads of eight or nine coins at times, totaling 7.3 to 6.45 taels. At this time, HSBC suddenly changed the listing, with British gold shrinking by 125, US dollars by 0.25, and Japanese gold adding 0.75. Yongfeng, Taikang Runyuan, and Chengyong bravely advanced, and they broke through the 70 tael mark. Until December, British gold only settled at 1.7375, and this month at 1.73125. The market was incomparably sharp, with the general idea of going straight to the clouds. At 11:50, it reached 70.04 taels, and retail investors on the table sold it, resulting in 69.45 taels, but the demanders were tireless, and they broke through the customs again. At noon, the closing price was 70.06 taels, an increase of 8.9 taels compared with the day before. After 12 o'clock, a large number of coins continued to be traded, amounting to 71.45 taels. Hedging companies sold, and it was suddenly cut by more than one tael. As a result, it was pulled back to more than 70 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Settlement Price Pressed Down to 43 Taels: It was found that the highest price in half a day was 70.06 taels, and the lowest price was 60.08 taels (compared to the listing). The initial opening price was 610.02 taels, which was pressed down to 48 to 43.4 taels. Later, because the listed Japanese gold was changed to 0.75, it was changed to 613.8 taels, which was pressed down to 43.4 taels. October was recorded at 84 taels, November at 80 taels, and December at 71 taels. The water compensation was 84 taels. The closing price of goods was 70.03 taels.</p>
<p>▲ The Number of Demands Far Exceeds the Supply: In the same industry, the transaction volume was generally greater than the supply, and few short sellers dared to do it. Yuda made up for its short positions, successively chasing in more than 2,000 pieces. Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Tianyuyong, Changshengyong, Yuanxingyong, Yuanchengyong, Fuyu, Chunyuanyong, Yuancheng, etc. all bought in.

<h3 id="e183">The Appearance of Tension in Foreign Exchange <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, being Saturday, the foreign exchange market was only open for half a day in the morning. Overseas silver markets saw slight gains, but the market was dull, and exchange rates all rose. The HSBC exchange rate in Shanghai remained unchanged from the early morning, but suddenly dropped by half a point around 11:30 AM. The exchange rates were: British gold at 1.25, currently at one shilling seven and twenty-five eighty-sevenths of a penny; U.S. dollars at 25, currently at 39 yuan; Indian rupees down 0.75, currently at 107 rupees 75; French francs down 0.75, currently at 993 yuan; Dutch guilders down 0.5 yuan, currently at 96.5 guilders; Singapore exchange up 1-2, currently at 145-2.25 taels; Japanese gold up 0.75, currently at 1 tael, 2 mace, 7 fen, and 2.25 li; Hong Kong unchanged, currently at 82 taels. As for the domestic exchange rates for British, American, and Japanese currencies, they were initially stable but later tightened, mainly because the gold price rose slightly in the morning and then became brisk, with a sharp upward trend. It seemed that a major player was shorting, breaking through the 70-tael mark. As a result, exchange rates became tense. Compared to the results on the 17th, British gold was down 1.875, U.S. dollars were down 0.25, and Japanese gold was up 0.01. Chinese gold companies were actively trading. Approximately 100,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with Hua Bi, Mitsui, Taiwan, Great Britain, and McGalliard all selling. Furthermore, banks engaged in tens of thousands of pounds of interbank trading, and also tens to hundreds of thousands of U.S. dollars in back-to-back trades. However, Chinese businesses had few transactions, and only tens of thousands of yuan of Japanese gold changed hands, with Mitsui selling and Taiwan buying. Although the exchange market turned bullish, it was not as brisk as the gold market, making hedging advisable. If export goods were to increase, the exchange market would likely depreciate again.</p>
<p>▲British Exchange Rates: The domestic market fluctuated by 1.875 from morning to noon, with relatively active trading. The morning market opened flat, with November quoted at one shilling, seven and a half pence, and a buying price of 5.625. December was quoted at 5.625, and January at 6.25, with a buying price of 6.875, but trading was slow. Later, as the gold market increased, there were transactions. Great Britain and Hua Bi did a back-to-back trade of 10,000 pounds for November at a price of 5.625. McGalliard and Zhengjin did a back-to-back trade of 10,000 for this month at a price of 7.5 pence. After 11 AM, Hua Bi, Mitsui, and Taiwan offered 30,000 to 40,000 for December at a price of 7.5 pence. By the afternoon close, the prices were even higher, with November quoted at 7.3125 pence, December at 3.75, and January at 4.375, with buying prices increasing by 0.0625.</p>
<p>▲U.S. Exchange Rates: The domestic market fluctuated by 0.25. In the morning, November was quoted at 39.5 yuan, December at 39.625 yuan, and January at 39.75 yuan, with buying prices increasing by 0.125. Hua Bi and Zhongxing did a back-to-back trade of 50,000 yuan for November. Mei Feng also sold 50,000 yuan to Zhongxing, both at 93.625 yuan. Shanghai and Bank of China did a back-to-back trade of 50,000 yuan at 39.6875 yuan. They did three trades of 85,000 yuan for December at a price of 6.875, as the gold price was over 63 taels. Later, HSBC and Shanghai did a back-to-back trade of 50,000 yuan for this month at 39.5625 yuan. After 11 AM, Shanghai sold another 100,000 yuan for this month at a price of 39.375 yuan, which was absorbed by Mitsui and Zhengjin. As the gold price exceeded 70 taels, the afternoon closing prices were 39.25 yuan for November, 39.375 for December, and 39.5 yuan for January.</p>
<p>▲East Asian Exchange Rates: The domestic market fluctuated by 0.75, with limited trading. The morning market opened with October quoted at approximately 1 tael 2 mace and 6 fen, November at 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen and 75 li, December at 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen and 25 li, and January at 1 tael 2 mace 4 fen and 75 li, with buying prices reduced by half a fen. Mitsui sold 100,000 yuan to Dayun for spot delivery in the morning at a price of 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen and 5 li. They also offered 100,000 yuan to Toyo at 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen and 62.5 li. Taiwan bought 50,000 yuan from Dayun for spot delivery at 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen and 37.5 li. As the gold price was over 61 taels, there were few transactions afterward. However, the price increased with the gold market. By the afternoon close, October was quoted at 1 tael 2 mace 6 fen and 75 li, with a buying price of 1 tael 2 mace 6 fen and 25 li. November was quoted at 1 tael 2 mace 6 fen and 5 li, December at 1 tael 2 mace 6 fen, and January at 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen and 5 li, with a buying price of 1 tael 2 mace 5 fen. The spread between spot and forward was 0.25, with each forward month differing by 0.5 fen.</p>

<p>According to a London cable yesterday, large bars of silver turned upwards, with near and forward positions up 0.0625, both at 16.75 pence (equivalent to British gold at one shilling, seven and eighty-one and a quarter pence). Local Chinese traders entered and exited, but trading was weak and the market was flat. After closing, the market appeared dull. Another cable from New York stated that the price of American silver remained at 30.06125 cents, with the British-to-American exchange rate plus 0.03125, at 4 dollars, 8 dimes, 5 cents, and thirty-one thirty-seconds. The American-to-British exchange rate remained at 4 dollars and 8 dimes and 6 cents. The American-Japanese exchange rate rose 0.0625 to 49.625 yuan.

<p>▲Market Overview: Yesterday was Saturday, and banks were closed for business in the afternoon. As a result, many customary transactions were delayed due to time constraints, making the situation lackluster. However, market trading continued as usual, with interest rates fluctuating and trending towards stabilization. Credit conditions eased again, but demand was indeed busy. This was because many payments were due this period, and all the clearing was beyond normal levels.</p>
<p>▲Interest Rate Prices: (Silver Interest) The morning interest rate was 7 mace, 2 fen, and 6 li, the same as the previous day. The afternoon rate rose by 6 hao and 2 hu and a half to 7 mace, 2 fen, 6 li, 6 hao, and 2 hu and a half, with the situation fluctuating slightly and without much change. (Silver Discount) Both the morning and afternoon markets were at 6 fen, the silver base loosened again, and the "hua tou" [brokerage fee] never increased. Bank quotations also had no market price.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Conditions: The morning price of Jiangnan small silver coins was 6 mace, 4 fen, and 4 li, down 1 li from the previous day. There were no transactions in the afternoon, so the market price remained unchanged. The morning price of Guangdong small silver coins was 6 mace, 3 fen, and 6 li, and the afternoon price was 6 mace, 3 fen, 6 li, and 7.5 hao, resulting in an increase of 7.5 hao. Trading volume included 2,500 jiao of Jiang jiao coins in the early market, with no trading. 120,000 jiao of Guang jiao coins in the early market and 90,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins weakened by 1,000 to 391,000 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow: (Silver Funds) Banks received very few payments yesterday, mostly due to afternoon closures. Chinese businesses received over 1.4 million in payments, foreign businesses received over 1 million in payments, and various commodity exchange taxes and miscellaneous payments totaled over 7 million.

<h3 id="e186">Continued Records of Long-Term Transactions <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Reports have previously documented the reluctance to make new long-term loans during this period. However, there were many cases of loans issued in April of the first half of the year that needed to be rolled over upon maturity. Forcing repayment would be difficult, and as a result, many loans were rolled over yesterday. In addition to those already open, the Weihaiwei and Yingkou groups made transactions of 2-3 million, with interest rates of 10 and 10.025 taels. The Tianjin and Dalian groups also had some transactions, with interest rates ranging from 9.75 to 10.05 taels. The transaction prices of various local groups varied widely and could not be used as a standard, so they are not listed. Other new and rolled-over transactions had agreements but the interest rates had not yet been determined. According to industry insiders, the upcoming due date (20th) should involve a significant amount of long-term deposits and loans, estimated to be no less than 6-7 million, but no agreement has been reached. It is predicted that most will be rolled over.</p>
<h3 id="e187">1929 Customs Bonds Suddenly Drop by One Yuan <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>▲Other Bonds Initially Rise, Then Weaken, but the Trend Remains Very Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the Shanghai securities market, trading in various government bonds remained light, with only 10,100 yuan of spot transactions. The futures market was also very quiet in the morning, and investor sentiment remained weak. Only over 1.7 million was opened between the two sessions. However, the market suddenly became lively in the afternoon, with more active transactions and greater volume, reaching over 5.5 million. The total was over 7.1 million yuan, including over 2.4 million in Demobilization Bonds, 1.9 million in 1929 Customs Bonds, and over 1.2 million in Reorganization Bonds. However, other bonds remained sluggish. As for the price trends of various bonds, the market was generally stable in the morning due to low trading volume and balanced supply and demand, with only slight fluctuations compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, a large player sold a significant amount of 1929 Customs Bonds, causing the price to decline sharply, with a total fluctuation of over one yuan from the morning to the afternoon market, down 0.95 yuan for the near term and 1.2 yuan for the next month's futures compared to the previous day. However, other bonds continued to show little change, with fluctuations of only 0.2-0.3 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3 id="e188">The Cotton Yarn Market: Low in the Morning, High in the Evening <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>▲The Overall Trend Remains Unremarkable</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market declined in the morning but recovered in the afternoon, but the overall situation remains weak. However, manufacturers are buying but not releasing, so the market sentiment is relatively firm. Today, the Sichuan group has 1,500 bales of No. 10 Red Star, which further tightens market sentiment. However, Japanese companies have a deep sense of selling short due to increasing inventory and weak current demand. Judging from the global situation, there is still no aggressive upward trend in the future. However, manufacturers have purchased a significant amount of Indian cotton raw materials, and due to their invested capital, they must maintain prices.</p>
<p>▲The Dull Human Trademark: At the opening of the pre-market for Human Trademark, the cotton market remained dull and lifeless, investor sentiment was scattered, and prices for all months fell by 0.02-0.03 yuan. Prices fell again in the second and third sessions, resulting in a drop of 0.03-0.09 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that spot yarn trading by the Sichuan group had slightly increased, and retail investors were covering short positions, causing market sentiment to rise slightly by 0.03-0.07 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was 18,400 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 1,150 bales, Dachangcheng sold 1,150 bales, and Tianlong sold 1,950 bales, with the rest selling 0.04-0.05 million bales. Yongfeng bought 1,000 bales, Yiyu bought 1,850 bales, Shenyu bought 900 bales, and Gongtai bought 650 bales, with the rest buying 0.05-0.06 million bales. The closing prices for Human Trademark are listed below:</p>
<p>Human Trademark Price	Change	Inventory	Closing Price	Change	38,600</p>
<p>October 15.00	Down 0.02	30,650	January 14.95	…	31,000</p>
<p>November 14.96	…	37,850	February 14.95	…	31,000</p>
<p>February 14.94	Up 0.03	41,500	March 14.97	…	14,150</p>
<p>▲Lively Spot Sales: Spot yarn sales are relatively good. It was found that all groups purchased a total of 1,935 bales throughout the day. Colleagues in the industry purchased 270 bales. Market prices are flat and weak. Sichuan province purchased 1,500 bales, the hinterland purchased 165 bales, Guangdong province purchased 50 bales, Shantou purchased 50 bales, the yarn market purchased 50 bales, and miscellaneous groups purchased 120 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Cotton Market Turns Slightly More Stable <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly more stable, but the overall situation remains poor. American cotton continues to weaken, and sales of spot cotton in the market have completely stopped. According to friends in the North and South cotton markets, farmers in the countryside who previously refused to sell are now willing to sell due to the poor situation. However, cotton brokers refuse to buy because factories have no capacity. Cotton brokers have no choice but to stop buying. This situation is rare in recent years. The price of cotton in Shashi, Hubei province, is declining. The previous day, bandits occupied the area, and the tax for one bale of white cotton (approximately 180 catties) was 2 yuan. Now that the military situation is calm, the army has withdrawn, and the bandits have fled, the 2-yuan tax per bale can be canceled, reducing costs for cotton merchants. Goods from the countryside arriving in Hankou are gradually increasing. In another week, arrivals in Shanghai could surge. Therefore, the Japanese company Dongmian Yinhang sold off 5,000 dans of forward positions for the second and third months in the afternoon, expecting to clear customs at 30 taels.</p>
<p>▲Hankou Trademark Returns Higher by 0.015 yuan: The Hankou Trademark opened in the morning, with a slight increase of 0.01 yuan due to the weakness of American cotton. Prices dropped sharply in the second session, and rebounded in the third and fourth sessions, ending up 0.005-0.015 yuan higher. Market sentiment softened slightly in the afternoon due to Japanese companies selling, rising 0.005 yuan each. The total trading volume for the day was 58,800 dans. It was found that Meiji sold 4,800 dans, Lichang sold 3,000 dans, Daji sold 2,800 dans, and Dachangcheng sold 4,200 dans, with the rest selling 1,280 dans. Yichang bought 3,600 dans, Yicheng bought 2,000 dans, Tiancheng bought 2,900 dans, Tianchang bought 2,700 dans, and Hengde bought 2,400 dans, with the rest buying 1,230 dans. The closing prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Hankou Trademark	Closing Price	Change	Inventory</p>
<p>October 31.30	Up 0.005	54,400	January 30.85	Up 0.01	117,400</p>

<p>December 30.85	Up 0.015	97,500	March 31.05	Up 0.01	49,400</p>
<p>▲More Foreign Cotton Opens: Spot cotton business is quiet. More foreign cotton has opened, sourced from 2,400 bales of Yaohua and 400 bales of Tonghua.</p>
<p>Rumite American cotton at 10.09 cents per pound, Yongan enters 3,000 pieces, delivered to the factory after 12 days.</p>

<p>▲American Cotton Continues to Be Sold: Yesterday's American cotton market was calm and uneventful. Prices initially firmed due to fears of frost, but softened later due to sales on Wall Street. Futures prices fluctuated by 1 to 4 points, and spot prices were unchanged. British cotton futures fell by 8 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (dated the 17th):</p>

<h3 id="e193">The Downturn in the Grain and Rice Market at Hexia Deepens <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, about 50 boats arrived. Sales were even more sluggish. The Changbang new japonica high-grade rice opened at 15.7 yuan in the early morning but dropped to 15.5 yuan by noon, a significant decrease of 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Ordinary japonica rice even fell by a staggering 0.7-0.8 yuan. Lower-grade rice opened at just over 13 yuan. The severity of the decline was truly rare. Thin rice was scarce and priced high, but lower-grade rice fell by 0.2 yuan. Sheep glutinous rice and Dushan rice were about to be on par, with prices decreasing by 0.4 yuan each. High-grade sheep glutinous rice opened at just 11.1 yuan. The terminal market was soft by 0.03 yuan, with weak buying interest and an opening price of 11.0 yuan. The source of terminal rice was constant, but sales were slow and transactions were few, with a decline of 0.01-0.02 yuan. Top-grade true glutinous rice was still around 10 yuan. The white yuan market was stable, with no significant changes.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai: Yesterday, 20-30 boats arrived, and the market on this street was slow. New Changshu and Wuxi japonica rice gradually plummeted by more than 0.5 yuan. Top-grade rice opened at 15.3 yuan, with very few transactions. Suxi groups of white japonica rice faced a severe decline, with high-grade rice falling by 0.3 yuan and mid-grade rice falling by about 0.04 yuan, opening at around 14 yuan. Although the sales of white indica rice and other varieties from the South group were not thriving, due to the arrival of fewer boats, prices only declined by about 0.1 yuan. Sheep glutinous rice remained sluggish. It was difficult to grasp the sales situation. Although there were some sales of Dushan rice, demand was limited. Therefore, street sales were stagnant, and prices fell another 0.3 yuan. High-grade Dushan rice barely opened at 11.5 yuan. Changbang rice remained popular, with high prices still opening at 15.5 yuan. The yin yuan situation was mediocre, with top-grade rice at 14 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Foreign Rice Still Sells in the North <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was still purchased and loaded by the North China groups, stabilizing the market. 700 bags of No. 1 Saigon rice were sold at 12.5 yuan. Terminal indica rice had sufficient inventory and was affected by the influx of cargo ships. The market continued to decline. Although some Southern groups and merchants from Fujian and Guangdong inquired, prices still fell by more than 0.1 yuan. 1,000 bags of Jiangxi early-season milled rice were sold at prices ranging from 10.025 to 10.9 yuan. 250 bags of milled yuan rice were sold at prices ranging from 14.65 to 14.7 yuan. There were no transactions for other types of rice. Nanjing rice and Anhui brown rice continued to arrive. Although Hunan rice was not scarce, the future situation was still expected to be weak.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Flour and Wheat Market: Near Term Active, Distant Term Flat <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>▲Flour Market: After the opening in the morning, due to slightly better quotations for imported wheat, morale was momentarily boosted, rising by nearly a cent compared to the previous day's closing price. However, in subsequent trading sessions, a pattern of near-term firmness and distant-term weakness emerged. Although the standard for the current month has fallen with the environment, spot goods from various factories still require around 3000 cash, so some manufacturers have been engaging in progressive buying, resulting in a better market atmosphere. Distant months are seeing mainland clients with long positions disregarding market conditions and selling against the trend, so the market remains sluggish. As a result, the current month is up 2.5 li from the previous day, November down 2.5 li, December down 5 li, January down 1 cent, and February/March down 1.25 cents.</p>
<p>▲Wheat Market: After the opening in both the morning and afternoon, the market for each month showed a pattern of near-term firmness and distant-term weakness. The current month is nearing settlement, and bulls, noting that the majority of spot goods on the market are of medium to lower quality, deemed them largely unsuitable for delivery. This has stabilized morale. Although imported wheat prices have improved by 30-40 cents for distant months, most people, feeling unaffected, continue to sell actively. The shorts believe that with imported wheat readily available, local wheat cannot hold its ground, so the market remains slightly down. As a result, the current month is up 2 cents from the previous day, November down 3 cents, December down 4 cents, January/February down 5 cents, and March down 7 cents. Currently, the high-quality wheat market has not opened; only 600 bags of ordinary Zhenjiang wheat have been offered at a price of 3 taels and 900 cash.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar Continues to Offer 30,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market reports from producing areas indicated that the spot price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.34375, and the price of New York sugar futures for December was 1.34, a decline of 1 cent compared to the previous report. March of the following year was 1.43, down 3 cents; May was 1.49, and September was 1.62, each down 4 cents. The spot price of Java sugar remained at 8.125, and the price of sugar futures for November was 8.00, with no change. The price for December was 8.00, up 0.125 from the previous session. The public market was quiet due to it being Saturday. The transaction price for new cargo of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white was 7 taels and 850 cash; new arrivals not yet released were 7 taels and 750 cash, with sparse transactions. Finely ground granulated white was 7 taels and 900 cash, with quiet interest. Dutch No. 8 red sugar was 6 taels and 300 cash, with the market remaining firm. Japanese sugar N mark was offered at 7 taels and 850 cash, and J mark at 8 taels and 100 cash, but there were few inquiries. YT mark was 7 taels and 700 cash, SH mark was 7 taels and 685 cash, and YP mark was 2 taels, with no surprises in the market. Japanese sugar factories continued to offer sugar, with Meiji Sugar offering Japanese gold at 4.55 yuan, for a total of 20,000 bags, and Minghua Sugar at 5.75 yuan, for a total of 10,000 bags, both for December delivery, an increase of 5 cents from the previous offer, with strong demand and a lively market atmosphere. In terms of Dutch sugar disposals, Xiangmao Foreign Firm sold 3,000 bags of No. 24 coarse granulated white for delivery in mid-next month, priced at 5.85 Dutch currency, with the market also quite firm.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: ▲ Dragon Mouth Vermicelli Goods in Short Supply, Preventing Out-of-Stock</p>
<p>▲ Sun-Dried Meat Arrivals Scarce, Expected to Rise</p>
<p>▲ Longkou Vermicelli Noodles: Recently, due to a break in supply, the market has reported out-of-stock conditions, and existing stock is scarce. It will take time for merchants to purchase from the source and ship to Shanghai, so there are concerns of supply disruption. However, due to the small amount of remaining stock, prices have not fluctuated significantly. Yesterday's market price was 20 taels.</p>
<p>▲ Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber: Current sales are still good, and the market is stable. Yesterday's market price was 37 yuan for top-quality, around 35 yuan for mid-quality, and 33 yuan for lower-quality.</p>
<p>▲ Xiamen Sun-Dried Longan Meat: Yesterday's investigation revealed that China Merchants Bureau Guangli imported only 11 pieces, making the supply even scarcer than before. Therefore, the market has tightened, with expectations of a rise of approximately 1 to 2 taels.</p>
<p>Seafood: Squid Production Light, Sales Sluggish</p>
<p>A current check of Shanghai's stock of old squid shows only about 300 packages in Tongjie. According to recent reports from producing areas in Japan, the supply of new squid is not as abundant as before, so the source is also becoming scarce. However, sales remain weak, and few goods are being moved. Market quotes from dealers are also unchanged. Currently, whole Qing big-piece box squid is selling for 43 taels, general goods for 41 to 40 taels, and peach squid for 39 taels. Prices for old goods are similar. New No. 2 pair of Zhou squid is 42 to 40 taels and 500 cash, and oil-added slices are 38 to 39 taels. The previous batch of Jinshan squid has already been sold out. Yesterday, a foreign firm sold 50 barrels for delivery in three weeks, priced at 39.5 taels, but dealers showed little interest.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: European Sales of Chinese Silk Increasingly Lifeless</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market in Shanghai's foreign firms became increasingly lifeless. Overseas silk sales showed no signs of recovery, and Jiangnan and Zhejiang silk factories were nearly entirely closed. Chinese merchants took a passive stance, and transactions were sparse. Yesterday, only Wei Cheng and others imported 15 packages of Shanghai white factory silk, Jardine Matheson and others imported 20 packages of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and Kechang imported 12 packages of coarse yellow silk, all at flat or weak prices.</p>
<h3 id="e196">New York Japanese Silk Prices Continue to Fall <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲ Heavy Stock, Sluggish Sales... Price Falls Another US$0.1-0.2</p>
<p>Since the intrusion of rayon sales and the low-price competition of Japanese silk in the American New York market, silk factory sales have plummeted. Recently, shipments of Japanese silk to the US have continued smoothly, and the stock of silk has increased daily. With autumn sales over, silk factories have sufficient raw materials for winter silk, so silk prices have weakened daily. The price of Japanese silk grade A was only US$2.45 per grade, grade B was US$2, and grade C was US$1.55, each down US$0.1-0.2.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Russian Firms Open for Keemun Black Tea <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>Since Russian firms began purchasing Sui'an Zhenmei tea, British firms have followed suit, and the market has become active. In recent days, both Zhenmei and Gongxi tea have seen brisk transactions. Wuyuan merchants and Jardine Matheson Foreign Firm have also been purchasing in small quantities. The top price offered by Russian firms for Gongxi has already reached 78 taels. Yesterday, Russian firms also earnestly sought to purchase Keemun black tea, and their market offer was significantly more relaxed than before.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Broadcloth Street Trading is Brisk</p>
<p>Recently, street sales of wool and broadcloth have been extremely brisk. Door-to-door merchants in both the North and South markets have been restocking daily. Goods such as serge, Walter cloth, fancy cloth, and yuan straight cloth are selling well. Clothing merchants, Western tailors, and hat makers are all showing strong interest. Sales of various colors of sea tiger velvet, felt cloth, overcoat cloth, hat cloth, and one-foot-six velvet have continued. The trade association is trending firm, and quoted prices are even more expensive than last week.</p>
<p>Metals: US-Kang Society Iron Sells Well</p>
<p>Recently, new arrivals of US-Kang Society iron from the US-Kang Foreign Firm have been scarce, so the market price has risen by about 2000 cash. It is said that the contents are very large in size and the goods are thin, so all industries and the street are happy to purchase them. As a result, more than 1,000 boxes have been offered in recent days, and various can factories are currently in negotiations for continued purchases.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Black Iron Sheet Reaches Peak <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Recently, arrivals of black iron sheets have been few, while purchases by various industries have been numerous, and the market supply cannot meet demand, so the market is unusually good. It is currently selling for 11 taels and 250 cash, an increase of 250 cash from before.</p>

Ms. Fuentes is an actress from La Scala House in Milan, Italy. She has been welcomed in cities across Europe such as Paris and Berlin. Her name is already on par with the beautiful soprano Galli-Curci. This visit to the Far East for a concert tour was arranged by Mr. A. Strok of this city. She arrived in Shanghai from Manila last week. Tonight's program will include songs from operas such as "Madama Butterfly" and "Iris." It is said that Ms. Fuentes will only perform once in Shanghai tonight. Tickets are priced at five yuan and two and a half yuan. They are sold at the theater.

<p>— Ke Hua</p>
<p>▲ After Listening to the 25th Anniversary Celebration of Fudan University</p>
<p>This time, Fudan University's 25th anniversary celebration actually included a musical performance, which shows that the school does not consider music to be unimportant. In fact, if a university that has been established for 25 years still has no musical organization, I think it would be a shameful thing. Although their performance may not have been perfect, as long as they were able to show their achievements, it showed the spirit of those in charge.</p>
<p>The program included orchestral ensembles, violin solos, ensembles, vocal solos, and choruses. The orchestra performed "Surprise Symphony" (Hey, Gay), "Mignonette", "Caliph of Bagdad", and the Eastern-flavored "Maharajah." Under the baton of the conductor, harmonious melodies flowed out. In particular, the cautious attitude of pianist Ms. Zhou Changming was admirable. According to the instructor, Mr. Lagaspi, "She is indeed a promising talent." In short, all orchestral performances rely on regular practice.</p>
<p>Ye Zantong's violin solo of Chopin's "Serenade" and Wu Shaofu and Peng Qixin's violin ensemble of Elgar's "Salut d'Amour" were both famous violin pieces and were played very movingly. I cannot describe the others in detail. In short, they all had considerable training.</p>
<p>At the same time, I observed the audience and couldn't help but feel doubtful. Westerners place great importance on concerts, dressing in formal attire and never making any noise. However, laughter and chatter filled the theater, and some people even made deliberate booing noises. I cannot help but doubt that the university students in the audience lacked musical cultivation. Therefore, musical education has not yet been fully promoted. Because if one has musical cultivation, they would not have these kinds of habits.</p>
<p>In this way, we must be even more convinced of the importance of music in universities. I believe that in the current universities, in order to promote universal musical education, at least two conditions must be met: First, there must be an orchestra. Second, music courses must be established and given academic credit. Some people may disagree, thinking that there are more important things that have yet to be learned. In fact, there are many scholars in China who regard music as a trivial skill. However, scholars who lead university education, we only see the youth's lives degenerate into indiscipline, transgression, and indulgence in depravity. I hope you can pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e221">About the Fudan University Department of Journalism <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>The Purpose Is to Promote Chinese Journalism</p>
<p>Students Are Working Hard on Nationalistic Literature and Art</p>
<p>Among the universities in the country that have established journalism departments, there are only two. The earliest was Yenching University in Beiping. However, their funding relies on the support of American missionaries. Therefore, Chinese students are cultivated into talents for foreign newspapers, instilled with a large amount of religious consciousness, preparing for a kind of anti-propaganda against the Chinese nation in the future. This kind of journalism education with religious aggression, to put it bluntly, is absolutely unnecessary from our nationalistic standpoint. Moreover, no matter how outstanding its achievements may be, it is always considered a great disgrace to our country's educators. Secondly, I want to talk about the Journalism Department of Fudan University.</p>
<p>It is under the jurisdiction of the College of Liberal Arts, so its establishment was after Fudan reformed its university organization in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations. Historically, it is naturally very short, only a little over a year. However, the content and organization are very complete, with a great momentum of "surpassing the predecessors." Its purpose is to cultivate specialized talents for the Chinese journalism industry, instill various necessary knowledge, and especially emphasize proficiency in literature and art. The instructors hired are all well-known giants in the domestic journalism field, such as Mr. Ge Gongzhen and Mr. Pan Gongbi. The enthusiasm of Director Xie in handling affairs is also well known to the public. Otherwise, a journalism department that has only been established for a little over a year would never have such achievements.</p>
<p>The department has a total of fifty-four students, most of whom have already achieved considerable honors in society. For example, Deng Youde, a graduate of the last semester, is now a teaching assistant in the College of Liberal Arts of Beiping University and also serves as an editor for the supplements of the Yishi Daily and other newspapers there. Chen Xiliang is responsible for various specialized positions in comparative journalism in this newspaper. Students currently in school, such as Tang Zenghongyang, have already gained considerable honors in the domestic literary and art circles and currently also serve as a professor of Chinese in the preparatory course of the university. Huang Huanruo is a special writer for "Caoye Weekly," the only publication with a nationalistic literary and art center. Wang Deliang is the president of the Fudan News Agency, and Du Bianwen is the editor-in-chief of the Fudan Five-Day Publication. These people are all outstanding talents of the department. Only Zheng Guojing, Wang Rong, Xiong Peifen, Tian Juchang, and Chen Xiangzhong and others were admitted as new students this semester, which shows that the examination of admission results is very strict. According to Mr. Xie Liuyi, the director of the department, the admission of new students this time also paid considerable attention to ideological aspects, so as to avoid the mixing of elements with proletarian consciousness, which would hinder the development of the department. Because the students in the department all admire the nationalistic movement, many have already made considerable achievements in this effort. Recently, the department published a "Fudan University Department of Journalism Commemorative Publication," which is extremely rich in content, with inscriptions from important figures in the party and state and giants in the journalism industry such as Zhu Yingpeng and Zhang Zhuping, and essays by Cheng Tianfang and Qu Wu. From this, one can see the general achievements of the department.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Social Bureau believes that previous national goods movements have not aroused the attention of women, so it initiated the National Goods Fashion Exhibition at the third National Goods Movement this year, which was supported by Shanghai women leaders and the silk industry association, the domestic silk rescue association, and the electrical silk weaving industry association. The clothing materials were supplied by Meiya and Zhendan Silk Factories, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, and Sanyou Industrial Society, and the tailoring was undertaken by Hongxiang and other companies. Early clothes, afternoon clothes, evening clothes, formal clothes, and cheongsams were all available, and they blended Chinese and Western beauty and practicality. It opened at the Dahua Hotel on the afternoon of October 9th. Celebrities and ladies were invited to try them on, and the shadows and hairpins were full of seats. Statistics show that more than a thousand people attended, which is an unprecedented event in Shanghai. It is expected that the impact will not only open a new page in fashion, but also serve as a model for promoting national goods.</p>
