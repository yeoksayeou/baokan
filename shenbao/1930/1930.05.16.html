<p>｜各大學之棒球比賽錦標未定｜</p>
<p>（一）網球</p>
<p>（東京通訊）日本遠東網球代表單打之布井及雙打之山岸志村最近因表演欠佳受衆彈劾事經前報當時以爲前述三人於大阪每日新聞主催之全日本網球錦標會中尙有挽回聲舉之希望誰知事弗如願布井於複賽（五月八日）時竟以二比六三比六六比八直落三盤復受挫於新鋭之吉原此戰布井似疲勞而夫常態惟其體質無耐久力及拙於處置對手之輕挑高球確爲招敗之禍根也雙打山岸志村組未參加山岸别與新進之村上配搭連戰順利至複賽時始以六比二四比六四比六二比六受挫於上原神代組且自今春來疊勝遠東代表之佐藤川地組竟出人意料以六比二四比六四比六二比六爲布井桑原組所敗據前述成績亦足見抨擊遠東代表資格者非無遠慮相信除單打之常勝將軍佐藤次郎外人選問題或難免多少紛糾也茲將大會决賽成績列左</p>

<p>四月三十日明治以三對一初敗連勝之早稻田五月一日第二回戰時两軍奮鬥至劇每局相交奪點卒以五對四明治連勝消滅早稻田冠軍之希望五月三日明治與成績末位之之東京帝人相遇第一回戰以二對零勝惟第二回戰則因士氣不振竟以三對四受挫（因秩序關係尙未决賽）隨後慶應與立敎之爭戰最爲出奇初賽慶應以五對四僥勝次賽於雨中交鋒成四對四之和局三賽則出人意外立敎始終亳不示弱延戰至十三局竟以一對屈服强敵立敎得此勝利軍威大壯五月九日與早稻田初賽因第一局之失策雖以一對五遭敗但十一日第二回戰立敎先聲奪人奮鬥到底卒以五對四雪辱今後之得要比賽僅餘十七十八两日之早慶戰據現在情勢言之慶應較多把握惟聨會成績明治迄安居首席此後秩序如尙有時日與帝大及慶應决賽則前者可無問題後者恐亦有操左劵之希望而慶應還有宿敵早稻田之難關惡破若與立敎决賽時以前三戰之經過未無多少不安難測最後結果或謂明治佔爲漁翁得利之機聨會錦標勢將垂手可獲膺選爲日本代表得次出席遠東大會亦意中事也</p>

<h3>市執委會告東方被壓迫民族書</h3>
<p>市執委會昨發告東方被壓迫民族書云自從本黨出師北代底定中原在東亞一隅積極開始反帝國主義的工作以來所有東方的被壓迫民族們也都前仆後繼的加緊了獨立運動的工作在這東方民族運動高潮中帝國主義者是在發抖了這轟轟烈烈的民族運動是負有歷史的使命是合有無上重大的意義的我們曉得自從蒸汽機發明産業革命完成資本主義確立勞資階級對立的形勢成熟以來依科學的原則演繹下去則社會革命是必然的會發生且必然的會達到推翻資本主義建立新社會的結果的可是事實上歐洲的資本主義到現在巳經差不多有一百多年的歷史了二百年來資産階級是天天在向着勞動階級進攻在這資産階級節節進攻的局勢之下各國的勞動運動固然是起來了然而在資本家的勢熖之下各國的勞動運動却又先後悲慘的失敗了大戰後歐洲破碎衰微的局面給勞動運動以絶好的機會更以蘇俄共黨的宣傅沉悶的勞動運動突然緊張起來各國都有嚴理的罷工各地都有工人的騷動「資本主義的末日到了」這呼聲充滿了整個的世界這呼聲巳經有事實使任何人不能不加以承認了然而在祗有短短的五年中局勢又完全不同了跟戰着後的秩序的恢復勞動之動也就回復到了戰前沉悶的狀態到了最近則差不多巳經是消聲匿跡的了資本主義安定了資本主義鞏固了資本主義萬歲這究竟是怎麽一回事呢是因爲資本家的槍彈豐富力量雄厚嗎還是因爲勞動者愚昧與組織力量單薄嗎不完全不是這樣一回事資本家的彈壓祗能加緊勞動反抗勞動者的組織與力量則也可說是早經充分的發達了目前資本主義的所以能够穩定社會革命所以又和緩下去是别有根本的原因的這根本原因就是資本主義的國家在我們東方找到了新的出路們用經濟帝國主義的取方式一方面把我們淪於殖民地·半殖民地次殖民地的地住一方面自巳却每年獲得很大的進欵拿去攺善他們國内勞動者的生活以和緩其革革郚運動他們把弱小民族的脂膏去豢養他們的失業工人他們把弱小民族的血汗去收買國内的勞動階級於是西方的勞動運動就回復到沉悶的狀態於資本主義的基礎又重要穩固了可是資本主義内的矛盾是永遠存在着的資本主義的基礎是永遠不能够穩定的他一方面把國内的勞動運動和緩了可是他方面國外的民族運動却因此而愈形緊張了所以一方面資本主義的基礎是穩定了而他方面則帝國主義的基礎動摇了在這個矛盾上面發了轟轟烈烈的東方民族運動我們相信東方民族的急進是必然的會制資本主義國主義於死命東方民族運動的緊張巳經使每一個帝國主義發慌了他們派重兵携大砲來鎭壓我們可是他們祗能够殘殺我們勇猛的烈士他們絶對不能够消滅我們的反抗運動他們臨死垂危的狂呔祗能堅張我們反抗的决心他們的末日巳經到臨了戰後十年來東方民族運動的所以此起彼仆而終未完成的緣故根本原因的有两點第一是内部階級的分化第二是各被壓迫民族間没有充分的聨絡我們曉得戰後實行共産主義的蘇俄自從在西方企圖煽惑勞動階級革命失敗回來深深的感覺至從正面攻擊資本主義的不易成功於是京决定了東方政策援助東方被壓迫民族起來革命想從側面去突破資本主義的陣勢當時我們被壓迫民族方面却正覺到國際間有力的援助的需要因此也極歡迎蘇俄來帮我們的忙可是我們要知道蘇俄是奉共産主義的國家共産主義的中心工作就是階級鬥爭所以當他鼓吹着東方被壓迫民族向帝國主義進攻的時候他同時就借了援助我們反帝運動之名派人前來煽動我們</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>國同階級識還很糢糊的勞苦階級起來向那將成未的資産階級鬥爭於是反帝國主義的戰線上就起了裂痕整個壓迫民族的力量就無莆中削去了一半在千鈞一髮的危機中帝國主義者却獲得了苟延殘喘的機會我們又知道蘇俄本身在從前也是一個帝國主義者革命後雖然攺變了他的態度可是他終究不是一個生産落後的弱小民族所以從他口裏喊出來的「弱小民族聨合」的口號所做到的祇是各弱小民族國别的與蘇俄發生些關係至於我們各被壓迫的弱小民族間始終没有充分的聨絡因此在過去我們者是人自爲戰的與頑强的帝國主義肉搏着因爲没有充分的聨絡因爲大家都是人自爲戰所以我們的力量就不能整個的表現出來我們的獨立運動就被摧殘了我們回顧着過去悲慘的失嵽敗面對着千鈞一髮的現狀我們是深深的感覺到有充分聨絡的必要了親愛的東方民族們呀我們都是裃被壓迫者在帝國主義的鐵蹄之下我們的脂膏我們的血肉巳經快要被吸完了爲求我們整個民族的生存爲爭國際間僅存的正義我們應當切實的充分的聨合起來一致的向帝國主義反攻目前確巳是東方整個的民族革命的前夜了在英帝國主義鐵蹄下呻吟了近百的印度巳經在聖雄甘地的領導之下衡到反帝戰爭的前綫了印度是我們反帝運動的急先鋒印度民族運動的成功或失敗就是我們整個東方被壓迫民族的成功或失敗印度的問題决不是僅僅印度人的問題起來所有東方被壓迫的民族們停止我們内部階級的對抗與分化羣固我們各民族間的聨合戰綫追隨着我們的急先鋒印度一致的殺入國際帝國的陣線裏去警鐘巳經在響了空前的反帝鬥爭巳經爆發了東方民族運動萬歲世界革命萬歲</p>

<p>劇中顧傳玠飾蔡生文英朱傅茗飾江納之長女蘭芳主角得人備見精采予巳久不覩傅玠面容轉腴風神奕奕與從前判若二人嗓音抑揚自如駸駸乎有媲美名小生俞君振飛之概</p>
<p>傳玠請宴出塲聨軸花額羅列殆遍間亦有連帶送傅茗者多一時名手法律界聞人如李祖虞陳霆銳諸律師皆在其列琳琅滿目記不勝記獨行素居士貽傅玠聨云詠以柔嘉詩傳雅化爲之歌曲衞玠美人字類西狹頌不知出何人手筆</p>
<p>唱麻婆子一段節促音哀意極頺唐至擊鼓堂配時一變而爲天眞爛漫與江納面質又極滑稽突梯之致無怪臺下掌聲雷動也傅茗出塲態度幽靚臺步工穩唱字咬句清而有韻逈異京劇中旦角斯爲名貴團圓一塲與傅玠花團錦簇璧合珠聨可謂完美而觀衆精神到底不懈可見藝術果臻上乘莫謂世無賞音也</p>

<p>前天（二十二）爲在紐約演戲最後的一日差不多轟動全市都曉得梅團要離開了紛紛前來定座走廐上站滿的都是人眞是人山人海滿坑滿谷站立的票子（Standingroom）都售盡了現在美國人所腦中没有一個不知道梅蘭芳的了中國明代亡國時費宮人刺虎一段故事尤其没有一個不知道前幾天有個羅馬尼亞大畫家（世界有名的）到了美國替畹華畫了一幅刺虎的像衣裙高高的束起頭髮披散着手拿着利刄面部表出沉毅而悲烈的神情這位藝術家說以我的筆寫出梅先生的藝两種藝術參合起來搆成一種偉大的作品千百世遺傅下去可以說是不朽之業啊最後的一天所演劇目是閙學青石山木蘭從軍剌虎四齣台下對於閙學甚表歡迎因爲易於了解但剌虎這齣戲業經早巳傅遍認爲最高無上的藝術巳有两家公司攝成片段電影以廣宣傅前日演畢又請求攝製五色彩片數分鐘畢事概未受酬幕完之後觀衆紛紛請求握手人數太多恐秩序紛亂於是在戲台上列一長桌畹華立於桌後求見者魚貫而入由下塲門入上塲門出男女老幼約四百餘人巳經握手之人猶佇立不去而未來的人尙不知有多少畹華的手都握紅腫了没有法子只好把台上的幕落下來人纔漸漸的散去眞是空前的盛况如果把當時情形攝成電影帶回祖國一映那末人人都曉得畹華在海外爭得無上的榮譽了</p>
<p>影戲裏的火燒房屋大都是假的自遠望去烈焰熊把一座華厦化爲焦土那不過是燒去了一個小模型罷了您不要聽信他廣告上的說話認爲怎樣大的犧牲</p>
<p>一幕賭窟那鈔票整千整萬雪片兒飛您不要以爲影片公司眞個發了財這樣的豪闊原來那鈔票都是冥國銀行的一塊錢好買幾百張</p>
<p>您不要以爲武俠戲裏的人物眞有怎樣大的本領倘果有其人那麽政府裏爲什麽不聘請他去以弭内亂以禦外侮呢原來一躍上屋是倒拍的爬到屋上跳下來便和聳身上屋一般飛行是用鉛絲弔的就是那雙劍在空中鬭擊也是借重索兒牽動說穿了都没有什麽希罕馬兒不動瞧上去好像飛也似的跑車兒不動瞧上去好像飛也似的開原來那背景是畫出來的把背景的畫幅捲動着便覺得那馬兒飛跑車兒飛開了</p>
<p>戲裏的風雨是利用自來水噴射下來并開起了電風扇狠命的吹戾那下雪更便當不過是灑些白紙屑罷了否則風咧雨咧雪咧是天然的那裏能夠這樣的凑巧隨意呢</p>
<p>一間臥室裏帳兒帷兒在那裏飄動便可知那幕是露天所攝那家影片公司是因陋就簡没有玻璃棚的</p>
<p>女演員演到很危險的地方大都是用男演員代替的倘然是遠景或不露正面那就有些靠不住您切莫亂誇伊的技能高强</p>
<p>英國美術考察記（下）汪亞塵</p>
<p>三皇家美術學院RoyalAcademy該院今年二月初至三月中旬舉行意大利名畫展覽會建築宏麗内部廣闊有勝於巴黎之美術學校余得友人介紹前往參觀院内設備完善堪稱藝術之學府右首二樓陳列繪畫數大間除歷來敎授之名作外餘皆平時學生中最精良之成績並有意大利文西之素描數幀即各國美術館中亦不多見陳列室外部收集歐洲各國著名畫家之調色板合記念而兼研究之意義至可寳貴</p>
<p>英人對於藝術素重傅統尤以學院風之繪畫爲尤甚技巧尙因襲皆徧於形式上之描寫莫談現代巴黎流行之表現派在今日之英國即印象派之繪畫亦不甚流行新派繪畫德法雖盛行英人不欲採納蓋英人對於學院派之觀念薫染至深余觀英國現代之繪畫僅約翰一人而巳英人作肖像畫有特長惟缺少活濯之生氣也</p>
<p>四英國春季水彩畫展英國自十八世紀風畫大家太納以後描寫自然界之技能有經久之遺傳水彩畫推英國爲最精亦以太納始直至今日尙不絶研究余此行適值英國皇家水彩畫協會舉行展覺會到倫敦翌日即前往參觀參觀之餘覺所得印象與昔日之想像殊異陳列畫件共計千二百餘點除少數較有趣味外餘皆因襲之技巧因襲技巧重精細描表面而無深刻之内容惟見該會中之作品大半售去可知一般賞鑒者之重視若在巴黎因襲之水彩畫並不受人歡迎且不多見英人視藝術僅知優秀與對象之寫眞遠不及德法人向時代之進轉也</p>
<p>五大百列顚博物館TheBrilushMuseum此館居位倫敦之中心館内陳列世界各國之文藝及科學品至爲完備範園之廣收藏之　可推世界第一余人内參觀歷四小時僅見繪畫部分之一角該館收藏繪畫分歐洲與東方两大部分歐洲繪畫無油畫都素描搜羅自文藝復興乃至現代大名家之作品殆無遺漏拉飛爾文西等之素描專列一室裝置極爲整齊有令人流連忘返之感最後两大間裝飾更精光綫配合亦非常適宜專陳中國及日本之繪畫日本人之繪畫論古遠不及中國故從略不述正中壁間陳列畫於石板上女佛像三尊按其說明係自直隸省發見之唐代物也人物結構衣冠風度確是唐代無疑色彩歷歷可辨誠精品也</p>
<p>宋代無名（白荷）一幅筆力雄健搆圖雋逸非近人作品所能比擬</p>
<p>禹之鼎（仕女）一幅筆意超脫氣韻浮動國畫中之逸品也</p>
<p>仇英（人物手卷）一軸工筆細巧無甚特特色</p>
<p>該館陳列中國畫除上述精品外贋造物甚多其中有一幅顧愷之「女史司箴圖」手卷令吾人最有研究之價值英國收藏顧氏之畫聞名世界顧愷之眞蹟在中國早巳失傅足可寳貴原畫長一丈二尺高一尺二寸共分八節描寫每一節有文字記述卷尾有顧愷之畫」四字右面印章十四枚左面印章十八枚全圖共有印章六十二枚此畫人物身寸都合尺度衣裳　帶鈎勒自然面部線條柔而有勁衣摺之反正各有分明回憶民國八年日本畫家平福百穗出品東京帝展一幅（豫讓圖）都根據此畫構成</p>
<p>顧愷之晋代人生於耶穌後三百六十四年死於耶穌後四百零五年離現在巳隔千五百二十五年余研究此畫結果有下列之疑點（一）相隔一千五百餘年原畫並無損傷（二）畫絹細膩如清代物（三）所傅朱紅色鮮艶奪目（四）卷末題名第三字（之）墨色深黑似係重加</p>
<p>日人著（支那上代畫論）書中曾述及顧氏此畫亦疑其爲贋造物中國繪畫傳流至千五百年以上殆不可能之事耶因國畫材料不如西畫之耐久歷來國畫以贋品亂眞常有之事即以該館陳列者贋品十居其三歐人鑒賞吾國古畫猶國人視歐洲古畫眞假難辨然則余此次對該館陳列之「女史司箴圖」亦未敢斷言其爲顧愷之之眞　也</p>

<p>A certain gentleman from a military organization who recently returned to Nanjing from Mamuji stated that the victories of the Central Army on the Longhai and Jinpu lines for the past few days are completely consistent with the victory reports from the front lines carried in various newspapers. The most noteworthy points are: (1) It is confirmed that Wan Xuancai's troops have surrendered. One battalion commander of his troops who was previously captured has been released and ordered to return to his unit and urge them to come over. (2) It is rumored that Shi Yousan is extremely panicked because Bozhou and Mamuji have been successively occupied by the Central Army. He has already withdrawn his troops to Daokou. The military situation on the Jinpu line and in western Shandong is no longer a problem. (Special Telegram from the 15th)</p>
<p>Official Announcement from Nanjing: A) The Circumstances of the Encirclement of Guide: After our army occupied Mamuji at dawn on the 12th, it immediately launched an attack at 7:00 AM towards the enemy forces guarding Wangqiao, Donglou, Yanglou, Pingtaiji, Luchiji, and Shizhuang.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Green International of Berlin</h3>
<p>People often have the idea of including everything, but the reality often does not meet their desires. Therefore, an organization that includes everything appears, and soon there is an equal organization. Once there is more than one organization, the one that includes everything cannot include everything. Unified countries are still like this, let alone an ununified world? The Green International, in addition to the Red International, is also an example.</p>
<p>To reform a deviation from one extreme, mankind cannot but use a means that is the opposite of this deviation to eliminate it. Otherwise, deeply ingrained habits cannot be effective. This is what the ancients called "correcting a wrong requires going beyond the right." However, once the accumulated evils are removed, this excessive correction is once again considered unfair by mankind and is seen as a flaw that needs to be corrected. Moreover, those who correct it are by no means a resurrection of those who were previously corrected, but the promotion of similar claims as before when criticizing the flaws of the previous correctors and attacking their contradictions. Therefore, those who correct socialism in the future will inevitably be another form of socialism and will never be imperialism or nationalism. This is the normal trajectory of world evolution and progress, and there is no possibility of reversal. Otherwise, why are monarchical countries becoming fewer and fewer, and why is autocratic monarchy no longer seen today?</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>

Liu Chunrong and Wan Xuancai have surrendered to our side. He Chengjun replied, instructing them to concentrate on their original defenses and await further orders.

<p>Sino-German Economic Cooperation</p>
<p>Both Sides Exchange Opinions</p>
<p>Nanjing: The German industrial inspection group is very busy with social engagements in Nanjing. There has been a significant exchange of opinions regarding Sino-German economic cooperation. Although Germany's current economic strength is gradually recovering, its external development has not yet been fully realized. However, because the domestic industrial sector requires a large amount of raw materials, it urgently needs a place to dispose of them. Therefore, the purpose of this trip to China is to investigate the progress of various construction projects in China and the quality requirements of construction materials in order to determine investment policies in China after returning to Germany. The authorities in Beijing originally had some consultations within a reasonable scope of cooperation, but they are also very cautious about safeguarding national sovereignty. Currently, this is just a preliminary contact. (Special Telegram from the 15th)</p>

The countries being resisted may also resist the import of U.S. cars and other goods in retaliation.</p>
<h3>British New Submarine Launched</h3>
<p>Reuter, London, 14th - The British new submarine "Haze" was launched at Chatham today. The submarine has a displacement of 1,475 tons and was built last July. This submarine is the first of the R-class submarines. Originally, six submarines were planned to be built, but the Labour government reduced the construction by four.</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Battle Ends</h3>
<p>Emergency Bills All Passed</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Satisfied</p>
<p>Electric Communication, Tokyo, 15th - Prime Minister Hamaguchi said in a speech to the general assembly of the Minseito Party yesterday that the authority and magnanimity of the major political parties have been fully demonstrated by everyone in this parliamentary session. He expressed his heartfelt gratitude. He was especially pleased that all the emergency bills had been passed. Regarding the arms reduction agreement, although there were objections in both substance and form, the treaty is not a permanent restriction. As for matters after 1936, which are said to be temporary, he dared to assert that national defense would not be lacking as long as the treaty existed. Piecemeal thinking and hearsay objections are not worth taking, and they are not worth fearing. Regarding the issue of supreme command, there were many who considered it an abstract argument that had no substantial impact, and no reply was given. In short, the government decided on the strength of the military power in the London Treaty after fully considering the opinions of the military. The government is of course responsible. It is not surprising that the formal theory originated in the upper house, but the lower house, which represents public opinion and claims to be a major political party, spent its time on the supreme command issue in the first half of the short parliamentary session and on the Xiaobiao issue in the second half of the session. It is regrettable for the House of Representatives and regrettable for the Seiyukai Party that they discussed substantive bills that have a great relationship with the lives of the people with an extremely insincere attitude. The result of lifting the gold embargo is that gold exports have reached 200 million yuan, but this is not at all surprising. What is the past performance of the Seiyukai Party, which attaches importance to this matter? If an active and indulgent policy is implemented, the result will inevitably lead to currency inflation, soaring prices, and trade. Gold outflows may become even greater. The Seiyukai Party has been advocating the restoration of the economy and relief for unemployment. If its claims are followed, it will only destroy the national industry. The government's facilities for revitalizing industry and improving trade are all aimed at solving the unemployment problem. Lifting the gold embargo is the first gate to restoring the national economy. The problem thereafter lies in the ratification and implementation of the London Treaty and the implementation of cleaning up discipline, reforming customs, purifying elections, reducing the national burden, and promoting social policies. The absolute majority of 270 people must not only be spectacular, but also use their strength to carry out state affairs for the benefit of the country and the welfare of the people.</p>

<p>National Society, Madrid, 14th - Santaydu, the Police Commissioner of the Spanish capital, has resigned today to take responsibility for ordering the police to use the strictest means to suppress demonstrators during the recent student unrest. This move is widely seen as an indication that the government is willing to accept conciliatory gestures.</p>

<h3>US Secretary of State Discusses Sea Agreement</h3>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 14th - Secretary of State Stimson stated to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today that the so-called U.S. secret warship, which was noted and discussed by various countries at the London Conference, was only a piece of discussion material and was not important. The US representative planned to submit one 35,000-ton battleship to fill the Weiyu Ming, which will be dismantled in 1936. The delegation determined to use two methods to fight for the US's equal status. First, the existing warship will be renovated, and second, a new warship will be built. The purpose of the above two methods to achieve the US's equal status has been achieved by the representative delegation. Subsequently, Secretary of the Navy Art Edmonds appeared to express his opinions, saying that the naval equality between Britain and the United States stipulated by this sea meeting agreement can be said to have been fully achieved. He also mentioned that there are sequential and balanced methods for building ships in the future. He said that Japan's new eight-inch gun cruisers and destroyers actually surpassed other countries. At this point, Hall, the chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, announced that the Senate should analyze the agreement in two ways to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>British Unemployment Problem Serious</h3>
<p>Imperial Free Trade Propaganda Campaign</p>
<p>Reuter, London, 15th - There are 1.7 million unemployed people in the UK, and imperial trade fell by 3% in the first quarter of 1930. Proponents of imperial free trade are now very active. Beaverbrook, the newspaper tycoon, said to a mass rally in Isan yesterday that anyone who understands the truth will not want to live in this situation in a perfunctory manner, but will want to make a big change, even if it involves changes to key figures in the Labour Party, the Liberal Party, and the Conservative Party, because we now want imperial free trade. At the same time, Conservative Party leader Baldwin also promoted the motherland and the empire. Lord Lee, who was recently in Britain, said that the guarantee tax rate is not only necessary for the country, but also for the empire. He expects that cheap labor in the world will soon no longer regard Britain as its sales market. However, at the banquet of the British Bankers' Association last night, British Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden made powerful remarks about the downturn in commerce, saying that in the first quarter of 1930, U.S. exports fell by 20%, and its unemployment situation was even more serious than what the British newspapers occasionally mentioned. It can be seen that world trade is sluggish, and the reason for this may not be high tax rates.</p>

<h3>The Central Propaganda Department Received the Press Community</h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at the Central Second Conference Hall at 2:00 p.m. on the 15th. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Zhang Tingxiu chaired the meeting and respectfully read the will of Sun Yat-sen. Central Committee member Shao Yuanchong then reported that all party and government affairs on the central side have been proceeding as usual recently. Although reactionary warlords are still making trouble in the north, the central government believes that it has nothing to do with it. It is reported that the military is very victorious. It is firmly believed that the northern reaction can be ended in the shortest period of time, which is a general alliance of reactionary forces. The public and society have a very clear understanding of the boundary between revolution and counter-revolution, so the psychology of the people is calmed, even if the reactionary forces in the north are large. At the same time, the work of the party department and the government has not been hindered and is proceeding as usual. In this situation, the end of this military affair can be the last time. After the report, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Central Army's Former Department Arrives at Guide</h3>
<p>There are still remnants of Wan Xuan's troops in Guide City</p>
<p>The Future Fierce Battle will be near Liuhe</p>
<p>Chiang Inspects Military Affairs in Dangshan Mamu</p>
<p>Xuzhou Communications After Chen Jicheng's division of the Central Second Army Corps occupied Mamu Ji, they pursued to the west, but there are still enemy troops stationed in the embankment near Mamu Ji, totaling about one regiment. Commander Liu immediately transferred the Chen Cheng Department of the Eleventh Division in the rear to surround the embankment and transferred the Great Wall armored train to attack the embankment. The enemy inside the embankment began to leave the embankment and escape on the 13th, but more than 300 guns were still confiscated and several were captured, including two enemy regimental commanders, who were escorted to the headquarters and each soldier was given one yuan to dismiss. The former department of the Third Division has arrived at Zhuji Station, which is known as Guide Station. 15 miles north of Guide City in Guide City, there are still the Second Brigade of Wan Xuancai's Department and the Training Regiment of Sun Dianying's Department. Chen Jicheng telegraphed Liu Shi and sent a unit from the Central Army and a unit from the Third Division to advance towards Guide. On one side, he still advanced westward along the route. Today (14), the military newspaper reported that the vanguard of the Third Division has been pressing towards Xiaoba Station. To the west of Xiaoba is Liuhe, which is the defense area of Sun Chu Guan Fu'an's Department of the Jin Army. There may be a heavier fierce battle near Liuhe in the future, as Liuhe is the first line of defense for the Jin Army.</p>
<p>Chiang inspected the military affairs in Nansuzhou on the 12th at noon and returned to Xuzhou at 12:00 on the same night. Yesterday morning (the 13th at 7:00), he took a special train west to Dangshan, where Liu Zhi boarded the train and went to Mamu Ji to observe. He also visited the wounded soldiers and rewarded each of them with ten oceans. At Mamu Ji Station, he gathered a group of officers and soldiers from the Eleventh Division and gave a speech. At 7:00 that night, he returned east in the original train. Chen Cheng, the commander of the Eleventh Division, came with him. At that time, Jiang Bocheng and Liu Zhennian, the commander of the new Twenty-First Division, came to Xuzhou from Ji'nan to pay a visit to Chiang Kai-shek to report everything and ask for instructions. It is said that Liu's Department has joined the Changqing area to deal with the enemy troops. After Liu met with Chiang Kai-shek, he returned north on the morning of the 14th. Chen Cheng returned west at noon. Chiang Kai-shek again inspected the First Instruction Division and Feng Yipei's department at Jiulishan in the North Station in the afternoon and gave a speech.</p>
<p>The transportation on the western section of the route is also very important. According to the railway authorities, the railway west of Mamu Ji was dismantled by Wan's army for seventy or eighty feet, several bridges were destroyed, and sleepers were burned. Many telegraph wires and poles were also damaged. The railway bureau has sent workers from Xuzhou Station to repair them, and the Ministry of Communications has also sent Dou Junshi to Xuzhou on the 13th and 4th to repair the telegraph wires so that the transportation on the western road can be quickly restored. Xuzhou Station also added a traffic train from the 13th to drive directly to the front line every day to facilitate transportation.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was news of the recovery of Bozhou in northern Anhui. According to news from the camp, a part of Sun's army in Bo City has not been resolved. The Yang Shengzhi Department of the Central Army is unwilling to bombard the city because of the people in the city. There is also a fierce battle on the Lu Xi side. Shi Yousan's troops attacked Dingtao County from Kaocheng, and Fan Xiji's army greeted and fiercely fought. According to the news from the camp, the Lu Xi telegram reported that Shi's army had been defeated and was retreating towards the north bank of the Yellow River. It is expected that the Central Army on the Anhui-North Lu Xi and Longhai lines will be completely connected within days. (14th)</p>
<h3>Military Situation Between Henan and Anhui</h3>
<p>Ma Mu Ji Under Siege</p>
<p>Central Army besieges Bozhou City</p>
<p>Sun Dianying's troops retreat to Luyi</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: The military situation between Henan and Anhui has slightly changed recently. According to front-line news obtained here, Wan Xuancai of the Longhai Railway line, after contacting the Central Army, is in an unfavorable situation on both sides of the railway. The railway line suffered particularly heavy losses due to the lack of armored vehicle protection. On the 12th, the 3rd Division of the Central Army, under Chen Jicheng, attacked Ma Mu Ji station. Wan's troops were reduced to only a thousand men, who retreated to the walled village of Ma Mu Ji and defended it behind closed doors. The 3rd Division then occupied the station and is currently engaged in fierce fighting while besieging Ma Mu Ji. On the Anhui front, after the Central Army launched an offensive, Sun Dianying's troops suffered successive defeats. Coupled with frequent changes in the troops, the soldiers lacked the will to fight. The 7th Division, under Wang Jun, occupied Wenji on the 9th and Dinggusi and Bao'anji on the 10th. The 10th Division, under Yang Shengzhi, drove out the remnants of Yue Xiangru's troops at Yu Ji Bridge on the 11th, and occupied Shizi River and Yu Ji Bridge. The 7th and 10th Divisions are now jointly besieging Bozhou. The Central Army air force dispatches aircraft daily to assist in the battle. According to a report on the 12th, there were about two enemy battalions gathering at the drill ground inside Bozhou City when three bombs were dropped, killing many enemies. Recently, Sun Dianying's troops in the Bozhou area have been withdrawing northward. Only a small number of troops are stationed in Bozhou City, which is under siege by the approaching Central Army, and Bozhou is expected to fall soon. On the eastern Henan front, the 8th Army of the Central Army has made unusually rapid progress in recent days. The newly organized 21st Division, under Li Yunjie, occupied Wang Boliao and then advanced rapidly towards Luyi. According to intelligence, the Central Army is now only five miles away from Luyi City. Sun Dianying's troops have all retreated to Luyi City, which is now under siege. (May 13)</p>
<h3>Chen Diaoyuan Goes to Jining to Supervise the Troops</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The area around Jining and Caozhou has gradually become important in recent days. A battle once occurred at Linpuji, north of Heze City. Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of the Provincial Government and Commander-in-Chief of the General Reserve Army of the Punitive Expedition, believes that the military situation is important and he must go to the front to command and inspire the troops. Yesterday (the 13th), the 87th Committee meeting of the Provincial Government proposed a leave of absence, and Zhu Xi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, was publicly elected to act as Chairman. The affairs of the General Command will be handled by Chief of Staff Li Erkang. In case of important matters, telegraphic instructions will be sought at any time. After all arrangements were made, Chen Diaoyuan departed for Jining at 12 o'clock on the night of the 13th. Starting at 11 o'clock, the railway station was placed on alert, with two regiments and three battalions of the Garrison Brigade, one company of infantry, and the Provincial Government Military Band. At 12 o'clock, Chen arrived at the station by car, shook hands with those who came to see him off, boarded the train and headed south directly to Jining. His entourage included Counselor Bai Baoshan, Advisors Yang Chunpu and Fan Xiren, Adjutant General of the General Command Bai Yushan, Adjutants Dong Zizhen and Zhang Jishan, and more than 20 others, as well as a platoon of guards and a company of soldiers.

<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department Emphasizes the Canal Dikes</h3>
<p>The Rise of the Huai and Yi Rivers Is Rare in the Last Decade</p>
<p>The Construction Department Attaches Importance to the Canal Dikes and Requests Funds for Repair and Defense</p>
<p>This year, both the Huai and Yi Rivers have risen. The water level at Bengbu on May 4 has reached 15.08 meters, which is more than 33 centimeters higher than the same day in 1921. The water level at Qingjiangpu is 2.1 zhang, and the water level at Gaoyou Yumatou is also more than 8 chi, both exceeding the maximum water level recorded last year, and still increasing. This situation is rarely seen in the last decade. The Jiangbei Canal receives water from the Huai and Yi Rivers, and the long dikes are the guarantee for the livelihoods of millions of people. The Construction Department attaches great importance to this, and has ordered the Canal Engineering Office to release water into the Yangtze River from the dams returning to the river as appropriate, in order to reduce the water level in the canal. At the same time, it has proposed to the Provincial Government to quickly allocate funds for the repair and defense of the canal dikes. The Provincial Government has now decided to advance 50,000 yuan from the department to meet urgent needs, and is preparing a summer defense plan.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Boats at Lujin Town, Jiangdu</h3>
<p>A Total of Six Vessels, Including Steamers and Tugs, Were Robbed</p>
<p>Two Passengers Were Injured and Tens of Thousands Were Lost</p>
<p>The robbery of small inland river steamers in Jiangbei is not an isolated incident. The Party headquarters and shipping associations of various counties have repeatedly sent letters to the competent authorities, requesting them to instruct the water and land authorities of the counties to eradicate the source of the bandits and effectively protect merchants and travelers. However, the Baotawan robbery case in Yangzhou occurred on March 27 and has not yet been solved. Yesterday (the 14th) at 9 p.m., six boats were robbed in the Miaodi area, 25 li south of Lujin Town, Jiangdu County, with losses of no less than 20,000 to 30,000 gold. The bandits fired hundreds of shots, injuring two passengers, setting a new record for robberies on the Jiangbei inland river. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The boats robbed: Zhenjiang Fuyun Company's Baoying-bound Fuyu steamer, the tugboat Fulai, the Qingjiang-bound Fuheng steamer, the tugboat Fuchang, Zhenjiang Zhentong Company's Qingjiang long-distance Jilin steamer, and the tugboat Guangji.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Robbery: The Fuyun Company's Baoying-bound Fengyu steamer entered the boundary of Jiangdu County at Lujin Town at 9 p.m. on the 14th. Suddenly, 70 or 80 bandits rushed out from behind the Miao temple, firing shots along the shore and ordering the boat to stop and dock. The captain of the boat, seeing the dense gunfire and fearing injury to the passengers, had to stop and dock to allow them to search. In an instant, the Fuheng and Jilin steamers of the Fuyun and Zhentong companies, which were bound for Qingjiang and towing tugboats, passed by in succession. The bandits also fired shots and ordered them to stop, and they all docked beside the first boat. The bandits then arbitrarily took whatever they wanted, aiming for silver dollars and jewelry. After two hours of robbery, they loaded the loot onto prepared fishing boats and roared away to the north, with losses of no less than 20,000 to 30,000 gold.</p>
<p>Bandit Apparel: Among the bandits, 20 to 30 wore white-brimmed military caps and gray military uniforms, with bullet belts and rifles or pistols. Some had bayonets. When each bandit boarded a boat, they first sent bandits to guard the engine room and the surroundings of the boat, and then smashed the red and green lights on the boat. The bandits mostly spoke with a Yancheng and Funing accent, but some also spoke with a northern accent. One of the bandits was named Zhang Jinbiao, who was inadvertently called by name by another bandit.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Before leaving, the bandits successively damaged the machinery of each boat and drained the water from the boilers, and then left leisurely.</p>
<p>Injured Passengers: Among the passengers, two were shot by the bandits. One was Qiao Mengqian, a Fuyun passenger sent by the Shanghai Jisheng Society to Gaobao for disaster relief, who was shot in the back and is now being treated at the Zhenjiang Christian Hospital. The bullet has not yet been removed. The other was Qian Chen, a Zhentong passenger's nine-month-old baby, who was shot in the leg. The bullet was removed this morning (the 15th) in Shaobo, but the baby died at 2 p.m. Qian Chen's family lives at Yangjingbang Road, Xiangyanqiao, Hongkou, Shanghai. The Zhentong Company helped them with travel expenses to return to Shanghai today. The most heartbroken passenger among those robbed was Wang Yiqing, a customs patrolman from Shanghai, who had 400 to 500 yuan in a leather suitcase when he boarded the ship in Qingjiang. The suitcase was exposed by the military and police during inspection, and all of it was robbed. He cried bitterly and was distraught when he arrived in Zhen.</p>
<p>Reporting to the Authorities: After receiving the alarm, the shipping companies sent personnel to investigate the scene and sent letters to the shipping association, requesting them to forward the matter to the competent authorities for speedy resolution. After receiving the report, the shipping association sent telegrams to the Ministry of Communications, the Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Sixth District of Water Police, and the Gaoyou and Jiangdu County Governments. The telegram stated: "Last night at 9 p.m., the Fuyun Qingzhen-bound and Baozhen-bound steamers, as well as the Zhentong Qingzhen-bound steamer, were robbed at the same time in Miaodi, 25 li south of Jiangdu County. The losses are incalculable, the machinery of each boat was destroyed, two passengers were seriously injured and are in critical condition, and several were slightly injured. The bandits fled north. According to the passengers, there were 60 to 70 bandits, including 20 to 30 with white-brimmed gray-uniformed armed men. We respectfully report first and will report in detail later." Wang Shouyi, Standing Committee of the Zhenjiang Shipping Association, bowed and deleted. (May 15)</p>
<h3>Preparation for Abolishing Likin in Hubei Province</h3>
<p>The Special Finance Office and the Finance Department Will Discuss Measures</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the abolition of likin taxes, the National Government has already issued a clear order to implement it on October 10 of this year, and the Ministry of Finance and the Finance Departments of various provinces have agreed to implement consumption taxes and all luxury taxes to compensate for the abolition. However, the tax revenue in Hubei Province is slightly different from that in other provinces, and the tax items are also extremely numerous. A thorough investigation and meticulous plan should be carried out first. Chen Shao-wei, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance, sent a letter to Zhang Guanshi, Director of the Finance Department, yesterday to discuss this issue and requested to schedule a meeting to coordinate the overall plan. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, I received a telegram from Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance stating that the central government has decided to abolish likin in the near future. It is requested that the total annual revenue from various likin taxes and similar likin-like taxes in each province, itemized and totaled, be reported to the Ministry within three days of receipt of the telegram for verification. Furthermore, it is requested that plans be formulated on how to pre-arrange compensation after the abolition of likin. It is requested that the department head or section chief in charge of likin taxes from the relevant department or division be dispatched to the Ministry before May 30 to personally discuss everything. This matter concerns the overall plan of the nation and should not be delayed or neglected. Upon receipt of this, I have investigated that this is a telegram sent to the Special Commissioners of Finance and the Directors of Finance Departments of various provinces. As it concerns the overall plan of the nation, it should be complied with. However, last year, the Ministry ordered the Hubei Province to temporarily collect the consolidated tax on behalf of the province. Five days ago, we reported the collected amount once, filled out a form, and sent it to the Ministry through our office, but our office has not yet actually taken over. It was only stipulated that the department should remit 100,000 yuan to the national treasury every week from the consolidated tax to support the military expenses of Hubei. Since this method was stipulated, the department has accumulated many arrears, reaching 2,300,000 yuan to date, and the five-day report form for the consolidated tax has only been sent up to February of this year. The March and April reports have not yet been sent to our office. Previously, in view of the National Government's explicit order to abolish likin in the near future, and thinking of the difficulties of tariff autonomy and the close relationship of the abolition of likin, on February 14, I sent a letter to your department requesting that the province's financial plan after the abolition of likin be actively prepared to avoid rushing into things in the future, and attached a request to expedite the complete compilation and submission of the survey forms for the production and sales of goods in Hubei Province and the survey forms for taxes and levies in various counties and cities, which our office had repeatedly sent to prepare special consumption taxes. Subsequently, our office dispatched special investigators to various regions to conduct investigations of goods on their own, and on April 14, I sent a letter to your department requesting you to forward it to the collection bureaus to assist in the compilation and submission of the survey forms. Your department replied that you would comply and stated that the province's financial plan after the abolition of likin was being discussed and would be discussed with our office after a decision was made. It can be seen that your department is carefully planning and can see the big picture. Now, upon receipt of the previous telegram, the deadline for the abolition of likin is approaching and will be implemented. The preparation of special consumption taxes by our office and the preparation of compensation plans by your department have reached a critical stage. Moreover, it is noted that the government has solemnly stated in the third annex to the recent Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement that it will make every effort to abolish likin, regular customs duties, coastal trade passage taxes, and other similar taxes and levies in the shortest possible period and to the greatest possible extent, and that the Ministry of Finance will adopt all necessary methods to ensure that the order to abolish likin on October 10 of this year is implemented. The eyes of the world are upon us, and if there is any delay at that time, we will not only lose credibility at home but also be ridiculed by the nations. Our office and your department share the responsibility and would not dare to jeopardize the overall plan of the nation due to a single thread. In addition to urging the investigators to proceed quickly, I am corresponding with your department to request that you first report the detailed figures of the province's annual consolidated tax revenue and similar likin-like tax revenues to the Ministry, and schedule a meeting between the department and office to coordinate the overall plan. We should also contact each other at any time to prepare for the dispatch of personnel to the Ministry for consultation. We should also work together to ensure the arrears and unsent forms are quickly filled and sent to meet the needs of the treasury and comply with the Ministry's plan. (May 14)</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Civil Wealth, Military Affairs, and Politics in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Yang Shuzhuang Will Return to Fujian to Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>Longyan Is Still Disturbed by Bandit Communist Rebellious Soldiers</p>
<p>The Marine Corps Advocates Financial Independence</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Chen Peikun, former member of the National Government Committee, temporarily acted as Chairman of the Fujian Provincial Government, Chen felt that the military and financial problems in Fujian Province were very difficult to deal with and telegraphed the National Government three times to resign, but all were comforted by telegram and not allowed to shirk responsibility. Chen then planned to go to Shanghai to meet with Yang Shuzhuang to report on the recent situation in Fujian Province and ask for instructions. Later, because Yang had already gone from Shanghai to Beijing to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and had discussed the Fujian affairs, it was heard that he would return to Fujian within days, so the trip to Shanghai was cancelled. Furthermore, because the local postwar public bonds issued by Chen when he was the Director of the Finance Department of the first Provincial Government held the second lottery at the end of December last year, the Finance Department has only raised 50,000 yuan for repayment after four months, which is still 100,000 yuan short. The political and business circles are urging to pay it off urgently. In order to maintain credit, Chen went to Xiamen on the 8th to borrow funds from the banking and money shop industries to prepare for payment. He will return to the province in about a week. The affairs of the Provincial Government will be jointly handled by Commissioners Jiang Pingfan and Lin Jinan. It is not yet certain when Yang Shuzhuang will return to Fujian, but it is heard that after Yang returns to Fujian, the Fujian situation will temporarily maintain the status quo pending the central government's decision. However, due to factual problems with military and financial matters, the Provincial Government can temporarily postpone the reorganization, but this cannot be delayed and a solution must be devised as soon as possible. In terms of military affairs, the counties of Longyan, Yongding, Shanghang, and Wuping are still occupied by the Communist bandits led by Deng Yiwei, Ruan Shan, and others. Zhang Zhen's division stationed in western Fujian was transferred to Chaozhou and Shantou, and its military strength was weak, so it could not actively suppress the bandits, which made the red atmosphere spread. The counties of Tingzhou, Liancheng, Ninghua, and Qingliu are disturbed by the rebellious troops of Zhou Ziqun. Although the Lu Xingbang Division stationed in northern Fujian had transferred Chen Rongbiao and Lu Xinming regiments to block the border counties, they only took a defensive position and could not attack. The two sides are still in a stalemate. In terms of finance, the financial and administrative systems have been completely disrupted since the 1926 political coup. The stationed troops levy taxes and pay their salaries on the spot, and the provincial government has no means to stop them. The headquarters of the Marine Corps stationed in Fujian advocated financial independence because the special commissioner's office could not allocate military pay on a monthly basis. It plans to set up a finance office in the defense areas of Xiamen, Funing, and Xinghua to manage expenses. If this is the case, the financial future will be even more pessimistic. In recent months, the expenses of various agencies in the provincial capital have relied entirely on the 150,000 yuan of assistance from the central government each month, but only about 70% can be paid. No matter how large or small other temporary expenses are, it is extremely difficult to raise funds. (May 10)</p>
<h3>Opening of the Second Phase of the Jilin Provincial Administrative Conference</h3>

The preparations for this event and the spirit of the staff and athletes this morning prove this point. The Chinese people have always valued sports, and now it has gradually changed its direction, thanks to the efforts of newspaper publicity. As for the athletes participating in the Games, they will strive to demonstrate the moral spirit of athletes and do their best. In the future, we will expand and promote sports universally.

Thousands of colorful paper streamers connected up and down, creating a dazzling sight. As the ship gradually left the dock, hands were held tightly and reluctant to let go. Until the streamers broke, they waved their hats and the sound of firecrackers never ceased. The enthusiasm of the people in encouraging the athletes was evident here. Li Huitang's Foot Swelling, Staying in Shanghai</p>
<p>Li Huitang, a legend in the world of soccer, has recently had swelling in his ankles and has difficulty walking. According to Dr. Guan of the delegation, Li will stay in Shanghai for treatment.

<p>Foreign Minister Wang Unable to Attend</p>
<p>All the athletes from our country participating in the Far Eastern Games departed from Shanghai on the Japanese warship "Taiyo Maru" yesterday morning. Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting had intended to attend but was unable to do so due to busy official duties. Since Foreign Minister Wang was unable to attend, the National Sports Advancement Association held a board meeting a few days ago and nominated directors Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, and Zhang Boling to represent the association at the Far Eastern Games. Zhang left with the athletes yesterday morning, while Lin and Zhao will travel to Japan by ship this Saturday and are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the evening of the 23rd and attend the opening ceremony on the morning of the 24th.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan University Basketball A and B Divisions Championships Won by Jinan</h3>
<p>A Division: 59 to 30 Victory Over Guanghua</p>
<p>B Division: Guanghua Forfeits, Jinan Wins Without Effort</p>
<p>The Jinan A and B basketball teams were invincible in this year's Jiangnan University basketball championship. Yesterday, the Jinan A team played against the Guanghua A team in the final match, with Shao Ji as the referee. The skills of the two teams were markedly different, and Jinan went on a scoring spree. As a result, Jinan defeated Guanghua by 59 to 30 to win this year's A division championship. On the same day, the Guanghua B team forfeited, and the Jinan B team won the B division championship without effort. The joy of Jinan's double victory can be imagined.</p>
<h3>Far Eastern Games Athletes' Dormitory Ready</h3>
<p>Meals Already Contracted</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The dormitory problem for the approximately 500 athletes from China, Japan, and the Philippines participating in the Far Eastern Games was previously reported to have been resolved by using the Japan Youth Center. The first and second floors are for China, the third floor is for the Philippines, and the fourth floor is for Japan. After that, the welcoming committee actively prepared everything. In addition to the 40 permanent beds on the first and second floors, 50 lightweight beds were set up in the library on the first floor. The third floor has 20 permanent beds, and each room has been renovated with thick mats for sleeping. The fourth floor has the same facilities. Over 1,000 blankets have been disinfected and cleaned and are ready for use when the athletes arrive. Each floor has several table phones installed for communication. Wiring work is currently underway. Meals are generally contracted to Baoting exclusively, and several chefs from northern and southern China have been specially hired to provide Chinese food for the Chinese and Filipino athletes. Japan will use its own national cuisine. The quantity and menu of each day are carefully considered by the committee to ensure hygiene, nutrition, and abundance, and strive to satisfy the athletes of the three countries.</p>

Tomorrow night at 7:00 PM, a farewell competition will be held with the Shanghai-based Japanese table tennis team at the Shenjiawan Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Overlapping Waves: Japanese Tennis and Baseball Situation</h3>
<p>| Far Eastern Representatives' Poor Performance Criticized |</p>
<p>| University Baseball Championship Undecided |</p>
<p>(1) Tennis</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) It was previously reported that Japan's Far Eastern tennis representatives, single player Bun and double players Yamagishi and Shimura, were criticized for their poor performance. It was thought that the aforementioned three had the hope of regaining their honor in the All-Japan Tennis Championship sponsored by the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun. However, things did not go as planned. Bun was defeated by the new player Yoshihara in straight sets of 2-6, 3-6, and 6-8 in the semi-finals (May 8). Bun seemed tired and not in his normal state. His lack of endurance and clumsiness in dealing with the opponent's light and high balls were definitely the cause of his defeat. The Yamagishi-Shimura team did not participate in the doubles. Yamagishi teamed up with the new player Murakami and advanced smoothly. However, they were defeated by the Uehara-Kamishiro team in the semi-finals with a score of 6-2, 4-6, 4-6, and 2-6. Moreover, the Sato-Kawaji team, which had repeatedly defeated the Far Eastern representatives since this spring, was unexpectedly defeated by the Bun-Kuwabara team with a score of 6-2, 4-6, 4-6, and 2-6. Based on the aforementioned results, it can be seen that the criticism of the Far Eastern representative's qualifications is not without foresight. It is believed that apart from Sato Jiro, the ever-victorious general in singles, the selection of other players may be subject to some controversy. The results of the tournament finals are listed below:</p>
<p>Singles Sato defeated Yoshihara</p>
<p>6-2, 6-2, 6-3</p>
<p>Doubles Bun-Kuwabara team defeated Uehara-Kamishiro team</p>
<p>6-4, 6-1, 4-6,</p>
<p>2-6, 6-2</p>
<p>(2) Baseball</p>
<p>The Tokyo Six University Baseball League's war situation as the previous article predicted with the circumstances at that time thought that early-season celebrations would result in a three-way triumph. In fact, the overlapping waves forming a chaotic situation prompted us to expand to supply those caring about the future of the far-eastern baseball championship to have a reading.</p>
<p>On April 30th, Meiji first defeated the winning streak of Waseda with a score of 3 to 1. On May 1st, in the second round, the two armies fought to the death. The game was intense, with each inning exchanging points. Finally, Meiji won 5 to 4, eliminating Waseda's hope of winning the championship. On May 3rd, Meiji met the Tokyo Imperial University, which had the lowest score. In the first round, Meiji won with a score of 2 to 0. However, in the second round, due to the lack of morale, they were defeated by a score of 3 to 4 (due to order relations, the finals have not yet been held). The fight between Keio and Rikkyo was the most bizarre. In the preliminary round, Keio narrowly won with a score of 5 to 4. The second round was played in the rain, resulting in a tie score of 4 to 4. In the third round, Rikkyo unexpectedly remained weak throughout the entire game. In an extended 13-inning battle, they finally subdued the strong enemy with a score of 1. With this victory, Rikkyo's military might was greatly strengthened. On May 9th, in the first round against Waseda, Rikkyo lost by a score of 1 to 5 due to a mistake in the first inning. However, in the second round on the 11th, Rikkyo took the lead and fought to the end, finally avenging their defeat with a score of 5 to 4. The only important games left are the Waseda-Keio games on the 17th and 18th. Based on the current situation, Keio has more certainty. However, the results of the league show that Meiji is still in first place. If there is still time for a final game against the Imperial University and Keio, there may be no problem with the former, and there may be hope with the latter. However, Keio still faces the difficult hurdle of their old rival Waseda. If they play Rikkyo in the finals, the results of the previous three games may cause some uncertainty. The final result may be that Meiji will benefit from the situation and easily win the league championship. Being selected as Japan's representative to attend the Far Eastern Games is also within their expectations.</p>
<p>(Note) The Meiji University baseball team attended the first Far Eastern Games and won the championship.</p>
<p>Tickets for the Mainichi Shimbun 5th floor are also available at that association or can be bought at the door.</p>
<p>All-Japan University Track and Field</p>
<p>1st Waseda...129 and a Half Points</p>
<p>Four New Records Created at the Tournament</p>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The Prince Chichibu Cup, the Third All-Japan Intercollegiate Track and Field Championships and the European Expedition Athlete Selection Conference, were held on the 10th and 11th at the Meiji Jingu Outer Garden. The weather was clear and the wind was slight, and the stadium was excellent. The results of the two days were quite impressive. However, the absence of Keio athletes was a source of regret for short- and middle-distance events and the discus throw. As a result, the strong Waseda University track and field team overwhelmed the competition and won the championship again.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Director of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Sun Benwen's Talk</p>
<p>Striving for Outlets for University Students</p>
<p>Drafting University Curriculum Standards</p>
<p>Universities Should Use Domestic Textbooks</p>
<p>Sun Benwen took office as Director of the Higher Education Department on the 8th and reported to the Ministry. Yesterday, he gave the following talk to reporters: He said that at the beginning of his tenure, he did not have a clue about the Ministry's affairs. He planned to wait until he had a slight clue and then follow the resolutions of the Second National Education Conference to strive to realize the specific plan for improving higher education throughout the country. (1) The issue of the outlets for university graduates. There are no concrete measures in this plan. This is indeed difficult to implement. However, the Ministry of Education must use various methods within the possible scope to encourage the development of social undertakings, so that university graduates can have a place to be useful. (2) University curricula have always been managed by each school independently. The Ministry of Education plans to gather experts in various fields in the shortest possible time to organize the drafting of university curriculum standards to unify university curricula and complete the drafting within one year. As for myself, I will actively plan to realize it in a timely manner. (3) Most of the current university textbooks use Western books. These Western books are mostly biased towards the racial characteristics of various countries and are not suitable for China's national conditions. Therefore, it is proposed to stipulate that, except for foreign languages, all textbooks should be compiled in domestic characters. This point has a great impact on the realization of nationalism, so we must pay attention to it. (4) Although the religious subjects in church schools have been abolished on the surface, they are actually the same old medicine in a new bottle, changed to a subject on the brief history of great people, anesthetizing young people and causing great harm. The Ministry of Education should conduct detailed investigations and strictly prohibit them. (5) My position as the director of the Sociology Department of Central University will end before the summer vacation and it will be difficult to get rid of it for a while. After the summer vacation, I plan to resign from my position so that I can concentrate on the administrative work of higher education.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Conducts Phonetic Symbol Training</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education is actively promoting phonetic symbols and has organized a preparatory committee. The Compilation and Examination Department is currently drafting the regulations. The compilation of the phonetic symbol reading and practice booklet has been roughly drafted in order to proceed in an orderly manner. It is heard that the 40 phonetic symbols will be explained first, then the writing method, then the pronunciation method, and then the Pinyin will be practiced. Afterwards, a Pinyin table will be attached for review and practice. Everything will be decided after a negotiation with Mr. Wu Zhihui.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Asks the Ministry of Finance to Review University Funding</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education informed the Ministry of Finance with the budget for Central University, Hebei schools, and Labor University for the 18th year, requesting the transfer of the consultation to the Finance Committee for review and approval to continue to pay according to the current expenditure amount, stating that the Ministry of Education approved the transfer of the budget list for central education expenditures for the 18th year to the Finance Committee for verification. The Central University’s funding is currently allocated by the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Education Fund Management Office at 110,000 yuan per month, and another 50,000 yuan is allocated by the Ministry of Education per month, totaling 160,000 yuan per month. Retracing the origin of this number, it was decided because the university has colleges of literature, science, law, agriculture, industry, commerce, medicine, and education, and its scope is wider than other universities, and its expenditure is so large that this number is not enough. Therefore, the Ministry held meetings with the Ministry of Finance and provincial government representatives in August of last year to discuss the university's funding issue. Finally, due to the actual needs of the university, the amount was approved by the Executive Yuan. However, this time it was reduced to 150,000 yuan per month. All the facilities of the university have long been based on the original due funding as the standard for the progress of school affairs. At this time, the funding was suddenly cut, which is naturally difficult to achieve. Therefore, the Ministry is not suitable for instructing compliance. Also, the funding for Hebei schools was originally 300,000 yuan per month during the trial implementation of the university district system. After the abolition of the university district system, the administrative yuan originally allocated 8,000 yuan per month for the former university district to each school and college. There was still a shortage of funding. Therefore, a request was made to the National Government to approve an additional allocation of 50,000 yuan per month, and the Ministry of Finance has allocated the full amount from January of this year, totaling 350,000 yuan per month. This time, the approved amount is 3,500,400 yuan per year, which is 292,000 yuan per month. The Ministry believes that the amount approved this time is far from the actual needs of the schools in Hebei, and it is difficult to instruct compliance. As for the funding for Labor University, it has been 64,000 yuan per month since March of last year. The content of the school organization and the distribution of funding have long been determined, and it is difficult to change it in the middle. The Ministry requests the Ministry of Finance to quickly transfer the request to the Finance Committee for a separate review of the funding for Central University, Hebei schools, and Labor University, and approve each to continue to pay according to the current expenditure amount.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province's 19th Year Education Fund</h3>
<p>Changsha Correspondent: The Hunan Provincial Government has attached great importance to education in recent years. For public schools, it has added equipment and expanded classes. For private schools, it has increased subsidies based on the excellence of their academic performance. Each county and village has established public libraries and universal compulsory schools, so that education is improving day by day. Now, in order to make it develop gradually, the Education Department has decided to add the Fifth and Seventh Vocational Schools (about 100,000 yuan) in the 19th year in addition to the original First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, or Vocational Schools, and to add the First Women's Normal School (about 120,000 yuan), to add an art gallery (about 30,000 yuan), to complete the construction of National Southern University (about 180,000 yuan), and to increase the funding for studying abroad by 140,000 yuan, the compulsory education funding by 1 million yuan, the private school subsidy by 170,000 yuan, and the contingency fund by 120,000 yuan. Together with the annual recurrent expenses of 3,793,053 yuan and the temporary expenses of 847,058 yuan, the total provincial funding is 2,021,042 yuan more than in the 18th year. Now the details and reasons for the increase have been made and submitted to the Provincial Government for discussion and implementation by the Provincial Affairs Council.</p>

<h3>Regarding Public Works Department Documents Primarily Being in Chinese</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association Sends a Letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors. The Shanghai Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Public Works Department Board of Directors yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the suggestion by Mr. Wang Yansong at the Association's third congress that municipal facilities must prioritize the convenience of the majority of citizens. Within the Shanghai International Settlement, Chinese residents constitute 80% of the population, and the amount of taxes paid by Chinese also accounts for 55% of the total announced by the Public Works Department. In reality, it should be even higher than this figure. However, all documents and announcements issued by the Public Works Department are in English, making it impossible for the majority of Chinese residents who reside and pay taxes here to understand. This is clearly inappropriate and such an erroneous practice should be corrected immediately. We hereby request that this matter be discussed by this Congress and that the Public Works Department be notified that from this day forward, all official documents of the Public Works Department should be primarily in Chinese and secondarily in English, so that the majority of Chinese citizens can readily understand the current state of municipal facilities." This matter was unanimously approved at the first meeting of the third congress on April 16th. We are corresponding to inform your board, and hope that your board will investigate and handle this matter, and await your reply.”</p>
<h3>Foreign Ratepayers Have No Right to Decide on Chinese Directors</h3>
<p>Explanation from the Public Works Department</p>
<p>Cunningham's Official Letter</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Government received a letter from American Consul-General and Senior Consul Cunningham, forwarding the Public Works Department Director's explanation of the Chinese director issue, stating that the Ratepayers' Annual Meeting only sought the opinions of foreign ratepayers and did not have the power to make decisions, in order to seek understanding from the Chinese regarding this matter. The original letter is transcribed below: "Regarding your letter of April 18th from the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, stating that 'This association officially declared the following on April 17th, 1930: This association confirms that foreign ratepayers in the Shanghai International Settlement have no right to discuss or decide on the civil rights that Chinese ratepayers in the Shanghai International Settlement should have. Based on this principle, the rejection of the proposal to add two Chinese directors to the Municipal Council by the foreign ratepayers' meeting on April 16th of this year is naturally invalid. We hereby solemnly declare this.' This has been translated and forwarded to the Public Works Department for verification. We have now received a reply from the Director of the Public Works Department stating that the Chinese Ratepayers' Association mistakenly believes that foreign ratepayers intend to decide on the rights that Chinese ratepayers in the International Settlement should have. The Public Works Department is well aware that foreign ratepayers have no right to decide on the issue of Chinese directors in the Public Works Department, and this power rests in the hands of the various national and Chinese authorities. The proposal submitted to the Ratepayers' Annual Meeting on April 16th clearly indicated that the Public Works Department was aware of the limitations of the foreign ratepayers' authority, and the purpose of submitting the proposal was solely to seek the opinions of foreign ratepayers on whether to request the various national and Chinese authorities to find a way to increase the number of Chinese directors in the Public Works Department." The Consular Body intends to request Your Mayor to forward the above explanation to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and hopes that any misunderstandings regarding this matter in the minds of Chinese ratepayers and the general Chinese population can be eliminated as a result, which would be fortunate. Furthermore, the proposal passed at the special meeting of foreign ratepayers on May 2nd to recommend to the relevant authorities to increase the number of Chinese directors from three to five has been sincerely supported by my colleagues and has been communicated. It has now been confirmed by the Diplomatic Corps. Therefore, the Senior Consul believes that the Chinese side will recognize that this approach is sufficient to demonstrate the authorities of the Settlement's approval of the desire of Chinese ratepayers to further participate in municipal affairs. I am communicating accordingly, and hoping for the best."</p>
<h3>Candidates for Japanese Director of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Presumption that Lawyer Okamoto Will Succeed</p>
<p>After Mr. Saito Takeo, the newly elected Japanese director of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement, resigned, Japanese officials and gentry held several meetings to discuss his successor. As a result, Mr. Kichi Miri and Mr. Otsu Okamoto were nominated as the most suitable candidates. Consent was sought from each of them. Mr. Miri repeatedly declined due to his busy public and private duties. The Japanese Ratepayers' Association then decided to nominate Mr. Otsu Okamoto as the candidate for Japanese director. Yesterday, it was formally submitted to the Municipal Council Board of Directors, and all the foreign directors present unanimously approved it. It was decided to formally recommend him in the name of the Board of Directors. Once the Diplomatic Corps agrees and approves, he can take office at the bureau. It is found that Mr. Otsu Okamoto is an assistant lawyer at the Murakami Law Firm, a graduate of the Tokyo Imperial University Law School, and has studied law in England for four years. He has been practicing law in Shanghai for many years and has had many contacts with Chinese and foreign individuals. He has now returned to his home country for private matters and is expected to return to Shanghai to take office within about two weeks.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Executive Committee's Message to Oppressed Nations of the East</h3>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee issued a message to the oppressed nations of the East yesterday, stating: "Since our party launched the Northern Expedition and established control over the Central Plains, we have actively begun anti-imperialist work in the corner of East Asia. All the oppressed nations of the East have also followed suit and intensified their work for independence. Imperialists are trembling amidst this upsurge of Eastern national movements. This vigorous national movement bears a historical mission and is of paramount significance. We know that since the invention of the steam engine, the completion of the industrial revolution, and the establishment of capitalism, the opposition between labor and capital has matured. Following scientific principles, social revolution will inevitably occur and will inevitably achieve the result of overthrowing capitalism and establishing a new society. However, in fact, capitalism in Europe has been around for nearly two hundred years. For two hundred years, the bourgeoisie has been attacking the working class every day. In the face of this onslaught by the bourgeoisie, the labor movements in various countries have certainly risen up. However, under the influence of capitalists, the labor movements in various countries have tragically failed one after another. The shattered and weakened state of Europe after the Great War gave the labor movement an excellent opportunity. Furthermore, the propaganda of the Soviet Russian Communist Party suddenly intensified the previously stagnant labor movement. There were serious strikes in various countries and labor unrest everywhere. 'The end of capitalism has arrived!' This cry filled the entire world. This cry already had facts that no one could deny. However, in just a short five years, the situation completely changed. Following the restoration of order after the war, the labor movement also reverted to its pre-war stagnant state. Recently, it has almost disappeared completely. Capitalism has stabilized. Capitalism has consolidated. Long live capitalism! What exactly is going on? Is it because capitalists have abundant ammunition and strong power? Or is it because laborers are ignorant and lack organizational strength? Not entirely, not entirely. Capitalist suppression can only intensify labor resistance. The organization and strength of laborers can also be said to have been fully developed long ago. The reason why capitalism is currently able to stabilize and the social revolution has slowed down again is due to other fundamental reasons. This fundamental reason is that capitalist countries have found new outlets in our East. They use economic imperialism to turn us into colonies, semi-colonies, and sub-colonies, while they themselves obtain large amounts of money every year to improve the lives of their domestic laborers and mitigate their revolutionary movements. They use the wealth of weak nations to feed their unemployed workers. They use the blood and sweat of weak nations to buy off the domestic working class. As a result, the Western labor movement has returned to a stagnant state, and the foundation of capitalism has become more stable. However, the contradictions within capitalism are always present. The foundation of capitalism can never be stable. On the one hand, it has mitigated the domestic labor movement. On the other hand, the national movements abroad have become more intense. Therefore, on the one hand, the foundation of capitalism has stabilized, but on the other hand, the foundation of imperialism has been shaken. On this contradiction, the vigorous Eastern national movement has erupted. We believe that the radicalism of the Eastern nations will inevitably deal a fatal blow to capitalism and imperialism. The intensification of the Eastern national movement has already panicked every imperialist. They send heavy troops and carry cannons to suppress us, but they can only massacre our brave martyrs. They can never eliminate our resistance movement. Their dying throes can only strengthen our determination to resist. Their doomsday has already arrived. The reason why the Eastern national movement has risen and fallen repeatedly over the past ten years since the war and has never been completed is due to two fundamental reasons. The first is the internal class division. The second is the lack of sufficient connections between the various oppressed nations. We know that Soviet Russia, which implemented communism after the war, felt deeply after failing to incite a revolution of the working class in the West that it was not easy to succeed in attacking capitalism from the front. Therefore, it decided on the Eastern policy of assisting the oppressed nations of the East to rise up in revolution, hoping to break through the capitalist line from the side. At that time, we, the oppressed nations, felt the need for strong international assistance. Therefore, we also welcomed Soviet Russia to help us. However, we must know that Soviet Russia is a communist country. The central task of communism is class struggle. Therefore, while advocating that the oppressed nations of the East attack imperialism, it also took advantage of the name of assisting our anti-imperialist movement to send people to incite our</p>

<p>national and those of the laboring classes, whose class consciousness was still very vague, to fight against the nearly successful bourgeoisie. As a result, rifts appeared on the anti-imperialist front, and half of the strength of the entire oppressed nation was lost. In this critical moment, the imperialists were able to survive and gain a respite. We also know that Soviet Russia itself was also an imperialist in the past. Although it changed its attitude after the revolution, it is still not a weak nation with backward production. Therefore, the slogan of "alliance of weak nations" that it shouted out has only resulted in individual weak nations developing some relations with Soviet Russia. As for the various oppressed weak nations among us, there has never been sufficient connection. Therefore, in the past, we were all fighting on our own, wrestling with the stubborn imperialism. Because there was no sufficient connection and everyone was fighting on their own, our strength could not be fully manifested, and our independence movement was suppressed. Looking back at the tragic failures of the past and facing the current critical situation, we deeply feel the need for sufficient connection. Dear Eastern nations, we are all oppressed. Under the iron hooves of imperialism, our wealth and our flesh and blood are about to be completely sucked dry. For the sake of the survival of our entire nation and for the sake of the remaining justice in the international community, we must earnestly and fully unite and launch a united counterattack against imperialism. It is indeed the eve of the entire national revolution of the East. India, which has been groaning under the iron hooves of British imperialism for nearly a century, has reached the front line of the anti-imperialist war under the leadership of Mahatma Gandhi. India is the vanguard of our anti-imperialist movement. The success or failure of the Indian national movement is the success or failure of our entire Eastern oppressed nations. The Indian problem is by no means just a problem for Indians. Arise, all oppressed nations of the East! Stop the internal class antagonism and division within us. Consolidate our united front among all nations. Follow our vanguard, India, and launch a united assault on the international imperialist front. The alarm bell has already rung. An unprecedented anti-imperialist struggle has already broken out. Long live the Eastern national movement! Long live the world revolution!"</p>
<h3>Zhao Shouheng Took Over the Position of Telephone Bureau Director Yesterday</h3>

The vacant position of Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau will be filled by Zhao Shouheng, Director of the Suzhou Telephone Bureau. Zhao, along with Wei Shusheng, Lu Minjie, and more than ten others, arrived at the bureau yesterday afternoon to take over the position first. After receiving and transferring the documents, they met with the office staff in separate groups and offered brief words of encouragement. As the transfer of both parties was arranged hastily, the official swearing-in ceremony will need to be postponed. A detailed account of the people involved in the takeover yesterday is provided below.</p>
<p>Personnel Announced: After taking over the position yesterday afternoon, Director Zhao announced the following personnel: Wei Shusheng, Director of the Document Section; Lu Minjie, Assistant; Yuan Mengyun, Secretary; Liang Mixiang, Director of the Business Section; Chen Mianqing, Assistant; Hu Wenjie, Clerk; Yu Peichang, Secretary; Zhang Peiji, Director of the Treasury Section; Feng Quqing, Assistant; and more than ten others.</p>
<p>Takeover Notice: After taking over the position yesterday, Zhao issued the first takeover notice, stating: "Regarding the notice that, upon the order of the Ministry of Communications, Zhao Shouheng, Director of the Suzhou Telephone Bureau, is transferred to the position of Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, and is ordered to report to duty immediately. In accordance with this order, the director of this bureau took office on the 15th of this month. In addition to reporting and sending separate letters, this notice is hereby issued for the information of all sectors."</p>
<p>Brief Biography of the New Director: The new director, Zhao Shouheng, is a native of Xingyi County, Guizhou Province, and is currently 36 years old. He graduated from the business department of the Yunnan School of Law and Politics. In 1928, he served as the head of the treasury department of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. He was transferred to the position of Director of the Suzhou Telephone Bureau last year and is now taking up this position.</p>
<p>Thoughts of the Departing Director: The entire staff of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau gave a farewell party for Zhao Fuyu, the Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, who was transferred to the position of Director of the Suzhou Telephone Bureau. Director Zhao is only taking a few of his close associates and section chiefs to Suzhou to work with him this time due to the small scale of the operation.</p>
<h3>Important Proposals of the Shanghai Shipping Association</h3>
<p>Attention to Sino-Japanese Navigation Rights</p>
<p>Today, the Shanghai Shipping Association is holding a plenary executive committee meeting to discuss and decide on the implementation of the following matters, which are extremely important. A detailed account of each proposal is provided below:</p>
<p>Requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Announce the Contents of the Sino-Japanese Treaty: Last year, the Shanghai Shipping Association, in response to the opinions of its members, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressing its opposition to the principle of reciprocal shipping benefits between China and Japan. At the same time, it issued a declaration stating that one-sided reciprocal benefits would put Chinese shipping companies in a deadly situation and that it would be willing to cease operations if the reciprocal benefit proposal was not withdrawn. Now, the Sino-Japanese commercial treaty has been negotiated and signed by Foreign Minister Wang and the Japanese representative. Is the issue of navigation rights involved in this amended treaty? The Shanghai Shipping Association believes that it has a vital interest in this issue and requests the Minister of Foreign Affairs to immediately announce the contents of the Sino-Japanese revision treaty to dispel public doubts.</p>
<p>Preparing to Establish a Shipping Bank: In recent years, the shipping industry has been in decline, and its rescue and maintenance depend on the circulation of funds. The various shipping companies in Shanghai have proposed the establishment of a shipping bank to assist the development of various Chinese shipping businesses. Last month, they invited various members to discuss the matter and reached a unanimous agreement. Various shipping companies have jointly elected Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Tieqiao, Yuan Ludeng, Li Zichu, and Liu Shisun as the members of the preparatory committee for the shipping bank. It has been decided to convene another meeting of various members today to discuss and decide on matters such as fundraising and establishment, and then actively organize to establish the bank as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Ending the Shipping Insurance Company: Last year, Shanghai shipping merchants were spurred by the sinking of the Xin Kang by a Japanese ship and launched the establishment of a shipping insurance company. In addition to insuring the safety of various Chinese ships, it also established a savings insurance program for ship crew and sailors, so that in the event of an accident, their families could receive compensation. However, more than a year has passed since the preparations began. Now, according to public opinion, it is proposed to postpone this plan and establish it after the promulgation and perfection of the maritime regulations in the future. Therefore, it has been decided to discuss how to end the prepared but not established shipping insurance company.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Independently Conducting Ship Fumigation: Regardless of whether it is river or ocean vessels, all ships must be fumigated every year for hygiene. According to current regulations, they must be fumigated twice a year. Various companies entrust the fumigation to private fumigation companies established in Shanghai. The various shipping companies in this port believe that fumigating twice a year is inconvenient and have stated reasons to the Jianghai Customs, requesting that it be changed to fumigating once a year. According to the opinion of the Bureau of Health, the customs cannot allow this. The various shipping companies then discussed changing the fumigation to be handled by special committee members invited by each bureau to avoid unexpected losses. After a decision is made today, it will be submitted to the customs for implementation.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Asks for Donations for Rice Price Stabilization: The price of rice is rising every day in Shanghai, and the average commoner really cannot survive. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has decided to expand rice price stabilization to help the starving people. However, every shi (unit of dry volume) of rice that is sold at a stabilized price will result in a loss of five or six yuan. These losses for stabilizing prices must be raised extensively. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has sent a letter asking various organizations to donate on its behalf. The Shanghai Shipping Association has also received a letter from the General Chamber of Commerce and has decided to present it to the general public for deliberation today to decide on the number of donations to be distributed on its behalf.</p>
<h3>Mongolian Delegation Describes the Current Situation in Inner Mongolia and its Propositions for Coming to the Capital</h3>
<p>Representatives of Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang are Obstructed by Feng's Army</p>
<p>This time, the Central Government has especially invited representatives from the six Inner Mongolian alliances to Beijing to attend and participate in the Mongolian and Tibetan Conference. The 32 representatives from the three eastern alliances of Inner Mongolia, along with their 19 staff members and secretaries, had already departed on the 12th, along with Li Chunfang and others, representatives from Jilin, and the reporter from this newspaper who met with Boyan Mandu, also known as Bao Wen, a representative of the people of the Zhelimumu Alliance, for an hour's conversation and thought that it was quite memorable, so I will state it separately below:</p>
<p>Reasons why the Western Three Alliances' Representatives Did Not Come: According to Gao Yuling, secretary of the Zhelimumu Alliance delegation, according to the regulations, there should have been more than 100 representatives from the six Inner Mongolian banners and alliances coming to Beijing to attend the conference this time, but as a result, only the representatives from the three eastern alliances and the Horqin Right Rear Banner (including staff members) and representatives from the Hulunbuir Banner (including staff members), totaling 70 people, came to the Central Government to attend. The Mongolian representatives from the western three alliances, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, etc., were unable to send representatives to come due to the launch of the Northwest Army and the impact of military affairs and traffic obstructions. This is also a pity.</p>
<p>The Date When the Representatives from Liaoning and Hulunbuir Came to Shanghai: The representatives from the Hulunbuir banners and the representatives sent by Commander Zhang Xueliang of Liaoning, totaling more than 20 people, departed from Shenyang on the 13th. According to news obtained from the delegation remaining in Shanghai yesterday, the two batches of representatives are scheduled to leave Dalian today and arrive in Shanghai by ship on the afternoon of the 18th. After arriving in Shanghai, they will stay overnight and then travel to the capital with the first delegation.</p>
<p>The Delegation States its Propositions for Coming to the Capital: Mr. Boyan Mandu told me that the Mongolian people have a warm enthusiasm for supporting the Central Government, but since the civil war has not stopped, the government has provided no guidance for the construction of Mongolia since 1930, causing cultural backwardness, which has inevitably disappointed the people. The fact that the Central Government is convening this conference shows that it cares about Mongolian affairs and treats them equally. He hopes that the colleagues attending this conference will follow the will of Dr. Sun Yat-sen to achieve China's early unification and achieve equality among ethnic groups, so that the Mongolian people can work under the Three Principles of the People to carry out autonomy and culture. At the same time, they can follow the spirit of self-improvement to curb the ambition of gradual invasion by the two countries, Japan and Russia. Mr. Boyan also said that he will go to Beijing first today, and the rest of the group will go to the capital together on the 19th.</p>
<p>Current Situation and Administrative System in Mongolia: The reporter also inquired about the current situation in Mongolia. According to Gao Yuling, Inner Mongolia is divided into six alliances, and Outer Mongolia is divided into four major departments. The highest level in the administrative system is the alliance leader. Under the alliance are the various banners, called kings and dukes, and the administrative heads of the Jhasak offices, the commanders of the banners, etc., are all important administrative organs. Inner Mongolia's military and foreign affairs have always been handled by the Central Government, so all public security systems are handled according to the local system. Since the establishment of the National Government, the names of various security agencies have also changed. Currently, those who maintain local security are the Public Security Team, the Baojia Team, and the Garrison Team, etc., without the name of the army.</p>
<p>Life and Customs of the Mongolian People: Few Mongolian people are engaged in farming, and most are engaged in animal husbandry. In recent years, Mongolia has been very barren. The planting disaster last year accounted for 80% of the total. The people there eat several kinds of food, from rice to sorghum, millet, and foreign noodles. Currently, the market price of each rice bag weighing 500 catties is 40 yuan in silver, each bag of sorghum and wheat (500 catties) is 10 yuan in silver, and each bag of foreign noodles is 4 yuan in silver. According to the representatives, they will stay in Beijing for about three weeks, including attending meetings, and then they must return to Mongolia.</p>
<h3>Protecting Russian Merchants to Come to China to Conduct Tea Business</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs previously received a report from the Shanghai Tea Guild stating that the Russian Merchant Assistance Association was forced to close down and return to Russia in August of last year due to the Middle East Road incident, causing huge losses to Chinese tea merchants. Now that Sino-Russian negotiations are gradually becoming amicable, the Guild had telegraphed to the Association's head office to inquire whether they could come to China to purchase Chinese tea. It was reported that their reply briefly stated that the prerequisite for coming to China to conduct tea business was whether the Chinese government could guarantee their business operations and personal safety. They requested a review and transfer of their request. After receiving the report, the Bureau forwarded it to the Municipal Government for separate inquiries to the Executive Yuan and the various ministries of foreign affairs, industry, agriculture, mining, military affairs, politics, and finance for review and discussion. Subsequently, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs responded to the Municipal Government, which informed the Bureau. It has now been heard that the Bureau has received Order No. 4351 from the Municipal Government, which approved Consultation Document No. 1109 from the Military and Political Department, stating that protecting overseas merchants is the inherent obligation of the country where they are located. Moreover, China tea is now the largest-selling commodity in Russia. If the Russian merchants sincerely come to China to conduct business and have no improper intentions, then our government should provide full protection for their lives and property. In addition to ordering the Songhu and Wuhan Garrison Commanders to provide effective protection when the Russian merchants come to China to resume business, they were informed and ordered the Bureau to forward the notification. After receiving the document, the Bureau has already forwarded it to the Tea Guild to notify the Russian Merchant Assistance Association together. The protection by our government for Russian merchants can be considered effective.</p>
<p>If the Russian merchants have no other intentions, they can come to China to resume business without worry. Not only can the tea market be restored, but the tea industry, farmers, and merchants in our country can also have no worries.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Boundary Received Case Files from the Appeals Office Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xu Weizhen, President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, dispatched Luo Wenyu and Qian Qizhong, secretaries of the record section, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to receive the settled case files from the former Sino-Foreign Appeals Office. Chen Shijie, the director of the office, dispatched Miao Yan and two other staff members to check and hand over the files one by one, for a total of 132 cases. There were also two cases of the Asia Appeals Case, etc., transferred from the Zhenjiang Foreign Affairs Office to Shanghai. The two secretaries, Luo and Qian, refused to accept them because they were not under the jurisdiction of this branch, and they are currently stored in the office awaiting submission to the Ministry for disposition.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tram Strike Update Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Public Concession tram workers were scheduled to meet at the Andong Hotel at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, waiting for a police representative to come out and mediate. At that time, more than 600 people arrived. Because there were too many people, the police representative rescheduled the meeting for 2:00 p.m. Therefore, more than 400 workers went to the company to negotiate. The manager, Baughis, still refused to acknowledge the conditions proposed by the workers. The workers were greatly angered when they heard the news. The police feared that this would cause trouble, so they rescheduled the negotiation for 10:00 a.m. today at the Andong Hotel. Yesterday, the tram drivers on Line 2 were hired by the company and found on the various roads to drive the company's cars. Yesterday, representatives from certain universities and elementary schools also provided financial assistance and comfort to the striking workers.</p>

<h3>### The "Fearless" Case to Be Tried Soon</h3>
<p>Hong Shen Hires Another Lawyer</p>
<p>Petition Urges Court to Start Trial</p>
<p>The screening of the sound film "Fearless" at the Great Light Cinema aroused the indignation of viewer Hong Shen, who delivered a speech to the audience saying that the film insulted the Chinese people too much. The audience then rushed to return their tickets, and Hong was arrested by the cinema and taken to the Xinzha Police Station. After negotiations, Hong was released, and he hired lawyer Wu Chengyu to file a criminal lawsuit against Gao with the former Provisional Court. Judge Gao Junxiang opened the trial on March 13th and adjourned it to the 21st of the same month for continued hearing. However, because the court had not yet been reorganized at that time, the American consulate, on the grounds that Great Light had American business connections, insisted on observing the trial, which was not recognized by our side. Therefore, the continued hearing on March 21st was postponed again because the issue of observation had not been resolved. Two months have passed since then, and more than a month has passed since the Provisional Court was reorganized into the Special District Court and the system of consular observation was abolished, but there has been no news of the continued hearing of the case. There have been rumors that both parties have reached a peaceful settlement. In fact, the cause of the case is the film "Fearless," and the content of the film insults the entire nation, so there is no possibility of reconciliation. It is now heard that the plaintiff, Hong Shen, is very anxious because the lawsuit has not been scheduled for trial for a long time, so he has hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to jointly conduct the case. Lawyer Zhan submitted a petition to the Special District District Court yesterday, requesting that a hearing be scheduled as soon as possible to avoid delays. It is expected that the case will continue to be heard soon.</p>
<h3>### Flying Between Shanghai and Hankou Takes Only Five Hours</h3>
<p>McHale and Nie Kaiyi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon The Wenhui Daily reports that Captain McHale, chief pilot of the Shanghai-Chengdu line of the Ministry of Communications, and Director Nie Kaiyi returned to Shanghai from Hankou this morning (15th). They departed at 7:20 yesterday afternoon and arrived in Beijing at 10:01, stayed for eight minutes, and continued to fly to Shanghai, arriving safely at Hongqiao Airport at 12:20, which took exactly five hours. This can be said to have set a new record in Shanghai-Hankou aviation. According to reports, Nie and McHale took a flight to Hankou on Tuesday to inspect the situation along the way in order to expand the route. They also flew to Changsha, which took only one and a half hours. According to McHale, the Changsha airfield is large and excellent, built with funds raised by local merchants.</p>
<h3>### The Sad History of Falling into the Cesspool</h3>
<p>Why Would a Mother Help the Tiger</p>
<p>Reselling to Xiamen Happened in the Blink of an Eye</p>
<p>A young woman who had fallen into prostitution was rescued from the Taiyuan Wheel of the Taikoo Company's Xiamen route yesterday morning by an investigator from the Relief Association. This was the second time she had been sold to Xiamen to work as a prostitute. Fortunately, she escaped and did not fall into the fire pit again. The details are as follows: The Sun Qiaolin, only seventeen years old, is from Taicang, Jiangsu. She is a modern girl with a beautiful figure. Her parents came from a poor background. Her father was a tailor in Shanghai, and his income was meager and could hardly cover household expenses. Therefore, Qiaolin helped her mother, Mrs. Shen, with laundry to supplement their income and maintain their livelihood. When Qiaolin was thirteen years old, the family owed a huge amount of rent, and the landlord repeatedly demanded payment. Qiaolin's family could not raise the money. A neighbor, who was a broker for brothels, learned that Qiaolin's father was destitute in Shanghai and saw that Qiaolin was beautiful and could make money. He went to her house and suggested selling Qiaolin to a brothel to earn a living, using the money to solve their urgent needs. Qiaolin's parents, who were suffering from the burden of rent, agreed. Thus began the source of Qiaolin's downfall.</p>
<p>Hanging Signs, Xueqin, Sixth Sister. Neighbor A, having obtained the consent of Qiaolin's parents, went to Mrs. Lin, who lived at No. 105 Rongqingfang, west of the Empire Cinema on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, to discuss the matter. Mrs. Lin was the former concubine of a prominent official, so people called her Mrs. Lin. Later, she had an affair with a gangster named Liang and rented a temporary residence there. She also rented a house in Hongbianfang near the Great World in the French Concession and opened the Fuleyuan Meiertangzi, buying women to sell their smiles for profit. At that time, the business was not bad. After Neighbor A contacted her, they agreed on Qiaolin's price of 200 yuan, with a six-year contract. Both parties agreed and signed an agreement. The money was handed over, and Qiaolin was sent to the hospital to work as a prostitute, hanging the signs Xueqin, Sixth Sister.</p>
<p>Secret Resale to Xiamen. This year, the hospital's business was poor, and the gate was deserted. The procuress Mrs. Lin saw the wind and secretly negotiated with a brothel in Xiamen to resell Qiaolin to the hospital for 450 yuan. She chose to take a ship to Xiamen yesterday morning, but because the Relief Association for Women and Children was strictly inspecting, she was afraid of being exposed. She went to Qiaolin's mother, Mrs. Shen, and gave her 10 yuan to send Qiaolin to the ship to get through the difficult situation. Mrs. Shen was indeed deceived. At four o'clock yesterday morning, when the sky was not yet dawn, she accompanied Qiaolin to the Taikoo Company's wharf in the French Concession to board the Taiyuan Wheel. Mrs. Shen did not leave the ship so that she could avoid suspicion if anyone questioned her and allow Qiaolin to go to Xiamen safely.</p>
<p>Investigation and Discovery. Not long after, Relief Association investigators Lin Yongfang and Chen Shaoting boarded the ship for investigation. They caught sight of a woman and a girl in the cabin who looked suspicious. When asked, the woman said that her name was Sun Shen, 39 years old, from Taicang. Her son was a carpenter in Xiamen and had sent a letter instructing her to accompany her daughter-in-law to Xiamen. After she finished speaking, she took out a letter from Xiamen, signed Rong Gengsheng, which was consistent with what Mrs. Shen said. The investigators saw the letter as proof and thought there was nothing wrong, so they got off the ship. They temporarily stood guard on the wharf to see if there were any other cases of abduction of women and children.</p>
<p>Landing Reveals the Truth. After dawn, the ship blew its whistle, announcing its departure for export. Suddenly, Mrs. Shen left the ship and landed. The investigators became suspicious and immediately detained her. They boarded the ship again and brought the woman (Qiaolin) who Mrs. Shen claimed to be her daughter-in-law, along with two lead boxes containing Qiaolin's gorgeous clothes, back to the police station. According to Qiaolin's confession, Mrs. Shen was indeed her biological mother, and she gave a detailed account of her fall. When questioned, Mrs. Shen admitted that Qiaolin was her biological daughter and said that she had endured this out of economic distress. The police chief, confirming that Qiaolin had been rescued, could not allow her to fall into the fire pit again and ordered her to be sent to the District Court for rescue.</p>
<h3>### Friends and Wives</h3>
<p>Sneaking Over for Secret Rendezvous While the Husband is Away</p>
<p>The Clever Wording of Clocking In and Out</p>
<p>Meng Lanting, who works as a waiter on a certain ship, lives in the French Concession. His wife, Mrs. Meng Liu, on the 21st of last month, took advantage of her husband's service on the ship to elope with her lover, Chen Bingquan, and hide in the Public Concession, living together like husband and wife. A few days ago, her husband's ship returned to Shanghai, and when he returned home, he only saw an empty house with nothing left. He immediately sent people to search and found out their whereabouts. He reported to the French police station, who ordered detective Qin Jinfu to arrest Chen and Mrs. Meng and bring them back to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the French court for questioning. The plaintiff, Meng Lanting, claimed that he worked as a waiter on a ship and only returned home once every ten days. The defendant, Chen Bingquan, was his friend who often came to his house to play. He initially thought he was a decent person, so he did not suspect him. Unexpectedly, he had an affair with his wife and dared to abduct her to live together. It was clear that the defendant often took advantage of his absence to come to his house for secret rendezvous with his wife, like clocking in and out for business. Now that he has been arrested, he requested a severe punishment and permission to take his wife back. When questioned, Chen Bingquan claimed that he worked as a cashier in a certain hospital. The plaintiff's wife, Liu, was an "elder sister" in a brothel. He went there to visit and became acquainted with her, so he also met the plaintiff and became friends. This time, Liu voluntarily lived with him in a small rented house. When questioned, Meng Liu admitted that she had an affair with Chen when she was an "elder sister" in a brothel and that she was confused for a moment. Now, she was willing to go home with her husband. Judge Zhu sentenced Chen Bingquan to two months in prison and allowed him to redeem his sentence. Liu was handed over to the plaintiff to take away.</p>
<h3>### French Concession Tram Price Increase No Proper Notice Posted in the Car</h3>
<p>Resulting in Disputes</p>
<p>The Wenhui Daily reports that this morning (15th), the French Concession trams had endless disputes due to the lack of suitable notices posted in the car regarding the price increase. Even at ordinary times, the ticket sellers often failed to answer immediately the price of the tickets that passengers should pay. After the price change this morning, they were even less able to answer immediately. This was all due to the lack of consideration by those responsible for managing the tram service. If notices with Chinese and English revised fare tables could be posted at both ends of the car, passengers could check for themselves when the ticket seller was in doubt, avoiding unnecessary disputes. However, no price increase notices were found in the car this morning. Of course, the new prices were printed on the blue price list, but it was difficult for passengers to squeeze into the crowd to read them due to the crowding. Therefore, for the company's sake, it is advisable to preprint notices and post them at the tram doors.</p>
<h3>### Four New Police Stations to Be Built in the Public Concession This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Public Concession will begin construction of four new police stations this year. The drawings have all been completed, and the estimated cost is over one million taels. Of these, the two in the Eastern District are the most urgent and will be built soon. One will be located on Yulin Road near Weituoma Road, next to the current preparatory team's building. After its completion, the Yangshupu Police Station will move in. The other will be built at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Glen Road. This is because the Eastern District has a growing population and is an important industrial area, and the police force is becoming increasingly busy, so it is necessary to add police stations. In addition, a new police station will be built in the Western District on Chengdu Road near Mendelan Road to handle the police affairs in the jurisdiction of the current Xinzha Police Station. In the Central District, the Central Police Station and Fire Station will be built east of the Citibank Building at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Jiangxi Road. These two locations will also begin construction this year. In addition, a dormitory for the Western Police Station will be built near Kade Road and Wangjiasha, which is also planned to begin construction this year.</p>
<h3>### Wanted Railway Bureau Employee Who Embezzled and Fled</h3>
<p>The case of Liang Shuxian (also known as Liang Hongqi), a former employee of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and Yin Peimin, a cashier, who embezzled funds and fled, has been approved by the Ministry of Railways to be submitted to the National Government for strict pursuit and arrest. The case has also been reported to the governments of Guangdong and Jiangsu provinces, ordering the local officials in the hometowns of the fleeing employees to investigate and confiscate their family property to compensate for the losses. The railway bureau has also sent a letter to the Shanghai Special District Court to seal up, evaluate, and sell all the real estate and property of Liang Shuxian, including the No. 7 house on Tiyu Road in Jiangwan, to compensate for the losses. It is also heard that the railway bureau has ordered the guarantors of the fleeing employees to recover the original guarantee money within a time limit. Those who fail to comply within the time limit will also be dealt with according to the law without any leniency.</p>
<h3>### Advertisements to Be Placed on Rickshaws</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Public Works Bureau recently received a letter from the Wan Guo Advertising Agency proposing to place various advertisements on public rickshaws. The letter stated that the agency was willing to donate a number of awnings to various rickshaw companies for installation on rickshaws. The agency would have the exclusive right to place advertisements on the awnings. Empty spaces would be left on both sides of the awning to display various slogans related to traffic and hygiene. Small objects could also be placed between the awning and the support rods without fear of theft. After carefully reviewing the letter and exchanging opinions with the French Concession Public Works Bureau, the Public Works Bureau replied to the agency as follows:</p>
<p>In response to your letter of April 8, we have learned of everything you have requested and can approve it, but you must comply with the following measures.

<h3>### New Houses Near Roads Built Beyond the Boundary Use Water from the Chinese Concession</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Urges Owners to Handle the Matter</p>
<p>There are newly built houses on Disiwei Road, Oujia Road, the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road, the intersection of Wuhua Road and Baoan Road, behind Yuqingli on Doulean Road, and at the intersection of Tongzhou Road and East Jiaotong Road in Yinxiang District, and behind Xinyili on Yuezhou Road. In order to prevent foreign merchants from supplying water beyond the boundary, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau previously drew up drawings and ordered the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to prepare to supply water to these new houses. The company immediately sent personnel to investigate the sites and formulate water supply plans. Except for the property owner of the houses at the intersection of Disiwei Road and Oujia Road, Yeguang Company, which plans to dig its own artesian well, (1) the houses on the Yokohama Bridge on North Sichuan Road plan to connect to the eight-inch water pipe in Dingxingli; (2) the houses on Baoan Road plan to install a two-inch water pipe about 300 feet from the Five Sages Archway on Baoan Road; (3) the houses behind Yuqingli on Doulean Road have already installed a two-inch water pipe on the sidewalk to the lane entrance, and can be connected when the project is completed; (4) the houses on Tongzhou Road must install a six-inch diameter water pipe about 400 feet long on Wuhua Road and connect to Tiandeli; (5) the new houses on Yuezhou Road have already applied for a license to install water pipes on Feihong Road and construction will begin soon; (6) the new houses in Xinyili can be connected to the water in the lane. It was learned yesterday that the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, upon receiving the report, immediately sent a letter to the owners of the houses, instructing them to contact the company to connect the pipes and supply water when the new houses are completed.</p>
<h3>### Catholics Pilgrimage to Sheshan</h3>
<p>The Railway Bureau Opens a Special Train</p>
<p>The Songjiang Sheshan Catholic Church will hold a pilgrimage on the 17th and 18th of this month. About 1,000 Chinese and foreign male and female Catholics will attend the pilgrimage at that time. Therefore, the Catholic Action Association sent a letter to the Traffic Department of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau yesterday, requesting that special trains be prepared to run from the South Station to Yaojinggang for two days, and that the association issue each person a train ticket to prevent others from mixing in. After receiving the letter, the Traffic Department of the railway ordered its subordinates to issue the first day (17th) special train, which had seven second and third class passenger cars carrying more than 500 people. It departed from the South Station at 4:25 am, stopped briefly at Xujiahui Station, and then got off at Yaojinggang, and then transferred to civilian ships to Sheshan. At 5:15 pm on the same day, the original special train returned to Shanghai. On the second day (18th), the special train had 13 second and third class passenger cars carrying more than 1,300 people. It still departed from the South Station at 5:15 am and went directly to Yaojinggang, and also returned to Shanghai at 5:15 pm.</p>
<h3>### The Serious Case of a Soil Peddler Being a Substitute</h3>
<p>A Soil Peddler Being a Substitute</p>
<p>Huang Zhenrong Said There Was Someone Else</p>
<p>Inspector Guo Firmly Denies It</p>
<p>On the evening of March 24 this year, the police station in the first district seized a large batch of opium outside the Bund of the 16th pier in Nanshi and arrested a soil peddler named Zhang Degen. He was immediately sent to the Public Security Bureau along with the loot. The prosecutor completed the investigation and filed a public prosecution with the District Court. Because the defendant Zhang Degen claimed to be a dock worker carrying goods for someone else and did not know that there was soil inside, Judge Deng opened a trial yesterday morning and summoned Inspector Guo, Patrol Captain Bai Xishou, Patrolman Wang Shimo, Liu Yulin, and Huang Zhenrong to testify. However, Officer Huang had been transferred to the sixth district, so the case was transferred to the sixth district. At that time, Patrol Captain Bai Xishou and Patrolman Wang Shimo testified that the opium was in two sacks loaded on a rickshaw, and Zhang Degen was indeed the person carrying the soil. However, Patrolman Huang Zhenrong testified that there was a car that night, with the Concession number 11531 and the Chinese Concession number 2743, carrying five sacks of opium. He discovered it first and immediately detained the car driver and the car. He did not recognize the defendant in court today and it was a swap. The judge was very surprised and asked Inspector Guo for an answer. Inspector Guo replied that this case was completely handled by Officer Wang Wencai. The judge then ordered an adjournment and sent a bailiff with Inspector Guo to the first district police station to summon Officer Wang to court. He testified that Officer Huang Zhenrong had caught the soil peddler and it was indeed this defendant. If he was swapped, how could the officer have this authority? The district chief was responsible for all internal affairs and was completely biased and falsely accused. He questioned Huang Zhenrong, who testified that he had indeed seized five sacks of opium and handed them over to Officer Wang. How could he have swapped the defendant? He replied that it was Officer Zhang who did it. The judge then questioned Zhang Degen, asking who would sell you out to eat a lawsuit. He replied that no fool would want to eat a lawsuit. The judge then asked Huang Zhenrong, what is your evidence? He replied that the Public Security Bureau had also investigated and understood, so District Chief Chen Zuyi had left the district. The judge then asked Prosecutor Wang to state his opinion, who said that Huang Zhenrong's statement that a car transported the soil and swapped the defendant was probably not the case. However, today is another part of the case, and the events that occurred can be investigated separately. The judge decided that the case was serious and did not open the debate, but waited for the investigation to be sure before opening the trial again. He adjourned the court and ordered the defendant to be taken back into custody and the others to return to the district to await instructions.</p>
<h3>### The Strange Shadow of a Fleeting Man</h3>
<p>The Cousin in the Concubine's Mouth</p>
<p>The Lover Hurts a Teahouse Customer Out of Jealousy</p>
<p>Gu Yunqing, a 27-year-old from Tongzhou, was widowed and lived with Ms. Xu (28 years old) from Gaoyou as his concubine at No. 9 Youchema in Nanshi, living together like husband and wife for more than five years. Recently, Gu worked on a ship and returned home less often each month and went out more often. However, when he occasionally returned home, he would see a man in the room laughing and joking with Ms. Xu without any scruples. Gu was suspicious and asked her, and she said that the man was her cousin, named Xu Guangde, 25 years old, living on Meixielu in Nanshi. When asked what he was doing here, she was vague. When the man saw Gu return, he would hurriedly say goodbye. This happened more than once. Gu had been with Ms. Xu for several years and had never heard of a cousin named Xu Guangde. He suspected that Ms. Xu was engaging in irregular behavior. When he returned home yesterday morning, Gu lied to Ms. Xu that his ship was about to depart and that he would board the ship and not return at night. After speaking, he went out. Around 1 pm, Gu returned home and happened to run into the man again. Gu could not help but be consumed by jealousy and immediately began to scold Xu Guangde. Xu Guangde also refused to be outdone, and they went together to the Yongxianglou teahouse nearby to have tea and reason. In the end, they disagreed and started a dispute. Gu was furious and suddenly threw a stool at him, but Xu Guangde dodged it and accidentally hit Chen Abing, a teahouse customer from Jiaxing, in the head. Blood flowed like a fountain and he fell to the ground in extreme pain. Officer Xu Xiuwu, the watchman of the 26th post in the area, heard about it and rushed over, bringing them all back to the first section of the first district. After preliminary questioning by the director, he ordered that they all be sent to the Shanghai District Court for trial.</p>

<h3>### An Apprentice Extorts Money From His Teacher</h3>
<p>Wandering and Restless, His Mind Wears Down Daily</p>
<p>Detectives Lay in Ambush and Capture Him in One Fell Swoop</p>
<p>Zhao Zhenhong, a 40-year-old from Ningbo, has been running the Yicheng Printing Shop at No. 18, Alley 3, Shaoqingli, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, for over eight years. In 1920, a friend introduced a Suzhou apprentice, Wang Arong, to the shop to learn the trade. At that time, Wang was only thirteen years old. After finishing his apprenticeship, he went to another shop to work as a partner, but Wang was wandering and restless, and was soon dismissed. Later, with the help of a friend, he returned to his teacher's shop to work. Last year, he was dismissed again, but he still came and went from time to time. On the 5th of this month, Zhao Zhenhong, Wang's teacher, suddenly received an extortion letter, ordering Zhao to prepare 100 yuan and send it to the letter basket on the wall next to the Deyi Teahouse across from the Samsung Automobile Company near Songshan Road. Zhao initially ignored it. Two days later, on the 7th, another letter came, increasing the extortion to 200 yuan. Zhao still did not reply. On the 9th, another letter came, with increasingly harsh words. On the afternoon of the 11th, another letter came, with slightly gentler wording, saying that he was now trapped in a small inn and asked for 60-70 yuan to help him out of his urgent need. Because the bandits were constantly harassing him, Zhao took the letter and reported it to the police station in the area. The police station sent detectives to guard the area, but they did not catch anyone. Wang Arong often came to Zhao's place during these few days, and Zhao secretly observed the situation and was deeply suspicious. On the day before yesterday (13th), another letter came, urging him more urgently and agreeing to meet on the evening of the 14th between 10:30 pm and 11:30 pm, ordering Zhao to prepare the money and first write a red paper strip and stick it on the letter basket, then put the money in, and someone would come to get it. After receiving the letter, Zhao secretly reported it to the police station and paid attention to Wang's actions. On the night before last, at 10 pm, Wang actually came to Zhao's place. Zhao pretended to discuss it with him and said that he had not yet prepared all the money and planned to send it first to avoid accidents. He then took a piece of red paper and asked Wang to write the sixteen characters "Don't be afraid, the amount of money is insufficient, if it is past the time, please send a reply" and asked Wang to go and stick it first. Wang believed it to be true and went happily. He wrapped a small package in coarse paper and put it in the letter basket, then quickly went to the police station to report. The police chief then selected six or seven experienced detectives, dressed up separately, and rushed to the area in advance, lying in ambush separately at the alley entrance, the neighboring house, and the opposite drying platform. At 10:30 pm, Wang swaggered over, first looked around the area, then tiptoed close to the fence and reached into the letter basket to take out the paper package. The detective who was lying in ambush on the opposite drying platform had already seen it clearly and blew a loud whistle. The detectives from all sides rushed over and arrested Wang, bringing him to the police station to await public questioning.</p>
<h3>Erecting an Electrical Substation</h3>
<p>Walls of Baiyi Temple Collapsed from Vibration</p>
<p>Monks Accuse Construction Company Owner</p>
<p>Demanding Compensation for All Losses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company is constructing an electrical substation near Baiyi Temple at 577 Guangxi Road. This project was contracted to Shen Daifa, owner of Yongchangtai Construction Company located in Yongji Lane, Avenue Edward VII. On the 5th of last month, around noon, workers from the construction company were driving piles with extreme force, causing the earth to tremble. Baiyi Temple, being in close proximity, was greatly affected, and cracks appeared in the walls, which soon collapsed with a loud crash. The monks in the temple fled in time, avoiding the disaster of being crushed. Afterwards, the temple's abbot, Zhenxiu, negotiated with Shen but to no avail, so he hired a lawyer to file a criminal complaint with the Special District Court, accusing Shen Daifa of committing the crime of endangering public safety. He requested Shen's arrest and trial, as well as compensation for all losses, including property damage and business interruption, to provide relief. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the trial, but the defendant did not appear. Lawyer Chen Tingrui was present, representing the defendant, claiming that the defendant had been suffering from a nervous disorder since last year and was still bedridden, hence his absence. However, the project he contracted was managed by his manager, Shen Ruishan, who is now present and awaiting interrogation, he said. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that in criminal cases, no one else could represent the defendant. Since the defendant refused to appear, he should be summoned to court. Judge Cheng ruled that the case would be adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Old Nanny Falls to Her Death from Drying Platform</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 1:30 PM, an old nanny named Zhang Xu, 58 years old from Suzhou, at Zhejiang Hotel, 114 Zhejiang Road, Sanma Road, went to the drying platform on the third floor to hang clothes. Due to years of disrepair, the floor was decayed and rotten, causing her to fall and split her head open on the cement, with blood flowing like a stream. She was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but despite all efforts, she died shortly after arriving.</p>
<h3>Husband and Wife Reconcile</h3>
<p>Thanks to the Judge's Guidance</p>
<p>A young woman, Qin Xia, recently filed for divorce from her husband, Qin Yin-fu, with the District Court, citing abuse and abandonment as grounds. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Keqian opened the trial. The plaintiff, née Bian, testified that she was 23 years old, from Taixian, and currently resided at 179 Jiya Gongsuo Lane, Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, at her mother's house. She was betrothed at the age of six and married to the defendant, Qin Yin-fu, at the age of eighteen, but had no children. Last June, she fell ill, but her husband did not provide her with medical treatment, so she returned to her mother's house to seek treatment and has not returned home since. The judge asked, "What is the purpose of your lawsuit?" (Answer) "He doesn't want me and mistreats me, so I came to file for divorce and request alimony of 400 yuan," she said. The judge said, "If he doesn't want you, he should be the one filing the lawsuit. Why are you filing?" The plaintiff was speechless. The defendant, Qin Yin-fu, testified that he was 23 years old, also from Taixian, worked at a car company at 25 Tianfu Lane, Gonghe Road, Zhabei, and did not want a divorce. She often returned home on pretexts. This year, Ma Zhenyuan, Zhang Jinding, and others came to his home, demanding that he pay 400 yuan to return his wife, but he was a broker and it was not easy to marry a wife. He requested a reconciliation because Ma and Zhang were attempting to extort money, he pleaded. The plaintiff's father, Bian Yuanhe, testified that he was 63 years old and that Qin Bian was his daughter. Since she returned home last year, medical and food expenses have been considerable. The witness, Zhang Jinding, testified that he was a former Chinese constable, currently unemployed, and had kinship with the Qin family. On the first day of February this year, Bian Yuanhe asked him to mediate so that Qin Bian could be sent back to her husband's house, but the defendant's mother vehemently stated that the plaintiff was sick and could not work and did not want her to return home, he testified. After questioning, the judge determined that the witness's testimony was clearly false and reprimanded him in court, ordering him to leave. Another witness, Ma Zhenyuan, testified, "What do I know? I don't understand." The judge said, "This kind of testimony is not credible," and then said to the plaintiff, "Your request has no grounds. You should return to your husband." He instructed the defendant to take the plaintiff back and not mistreat her, and the plaintiff should not frequently return home on pretexts. The defendant said, "If I take the plaintiff back, what if her father hides her?" The judge said, "If there is any concealment, the law will punish it." The judge repeatedly guided both parties, and both expressed satisfaction and reconciliation. The husband and wife reconciled, signed the agreement, and left the court.</p>
<h3>Bigamy Case to Be Judged Today</h3>
<p>A young woman, Wu Fuzhen, filed a criminal complaint with the District Court accusing her husband, Gao Jinshen, of bigamy and abandonment. The prosecutor's interrogation was clear, and he was prosecuted for the crime of bigamy under Article 254 of the Criminal Law. On the 7th of this month, Criminal Judge Shen Bingrong opened the trial and ordered Gao Jinshen to be remanded in custody pending further investigation, as more evidence was needed. It is now known that this case was again opened yesterday morning by Judge Shen. The defendant still hired lawyer Ye Fukang to defend him. The plaintiff, Wu Fuzhen, was not present, and only her lawyer, Zhou Yu, was present, requesting alimony of 8,000 yuan and clothes, etc., worth 81 yuan, for a total of 8,081 yuan. After ascending the bench, Judge Shen ordered the detained Gao Jinshen to be brought to the case and briefly questioned him. The judge then ordered the witness, Xu Fusheng, to testify that he runs the Xu Tongxing Rental Shop in Hongzhen. On the tenth day of October last year, he rented out palace gowns, veils, tea carrier, chair covers, silk fabrics, and a car, which were rented via Yusheng Winery for the use of a bride. The rental was 26.40 yuan. The judge then ordered an in-court interrogation of Xu Fusheng, asking if the groom who married at the China Hotel on that day was Gao Jinshen. Xu replied yes. Zhu Ziliang, a waiter at the China Hotel, testified that on the tenth day of October last year, Gao Jinshen did rent a hall and two rooms, numbers five and thirty-four, for 2.20 yuan and 1.75 yuan, respectively, and the hall for 8 yuan. He did not know if they had a wedding ceremony. Luo Shunrong, a teahouse waiter at the China Hotel, gave the same testimony as Zhu Ziliang. After the testimony, the judge invited Prosecutor Xu to present the indictment and the lawyers for both parties to present their arguments one after another. The judge then announced the end of the debate and set the judgment for the 16th (today) morning, and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>First Request for Separation, Then Divorce</h3>
<p>A young woman from Yangzhou, Yao Su, recently hired lawyer Shen Yong to file a petition with the District Court requesting separation from her husband, Yao Gongshou, on two grounds: (1) excessive affection; (2) frequent abuse. She stated that she was 21 years old and resided at 10 Zhaofang Lane, Xibaoxing Road, Zhabei. On April 20 last year, she married Yao Gongshou, a native of the same village, who lived at 64 Haichang Road, Yaojia Stone Bridge, Zhabei. Due to unbearable abuse, she requested permission to separate. Yesterday, Judge Tong Shenglv opened the trial. The plaintiff testified to the previous situation, but the defendant denied abuse. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff changed her plea in court and requested a divorce. The judge ordered both parties to go outside and reconcile within one week. If reconciliation failed, a hearing would be scheduled.</p>
<h3>Stealing a Military Officer's Money</h3>
<p>Convicted and Sentenced to Three Months in Prison</p>
<p>Gu Xiaodi, a servant on a French naval vessel stationed in Shanghai, stole 767 yuan in cash from military officers Bugu En and Beili Xi the night before. Bugu and Beili discovered the theft and reported it to the police, who arrested Gu and recovered 290 yuan in stolen money. He was taken to the French Concession Court yesterday for investigation. Gu confessed to the theft and said that he had lost the remaining money gambling and could not return it immediately. The Chinese and foreign officials sentenced him to three months in a Western prison and ordered the stolen money to be returned to the plaintiffs.</p>
<h3>Russian Swindles Large Sums of Money and Goods, Flees to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Escapes After Hearing the News, Not Yet Captured</p>
<p>Last summer, a Russian named Savieli Liek swindled 18,000 yuan worth of goods from the Russian trading company Dunmei Import and Export Company in Liaoning and fled to Shanghai, hiding at 12 Zhoushan Road. Recently, Wuli Telexin found out and telegraphed his friend in Shanghai, a British citizen named Ha Si, who hired lawyer Fan Gang to file a complaint with the Special District Court and issue an order for arrest. However, Savieli had fled after hearing the news. Yesterday morning, lawyer Fan submitted a statement to the court stating that the defendant had not yet been captured and requested an extension, which was approved by Judge Sun for 14 days. Lawyer Fan also telegraphed the plaintiff, urging him to come and handle the matter immediately.</p>
<h3>Unfilial Son</h3>
<p>Beats Father for Money</p>
<p>Yao Pinli, 64 years old, a local resident who lives at 130 North Caojiazhai, Caojiawan, West Shanghai, works as a farmer. He has a son named Linsheng, 26 years old, who has been married for many years. Recently, Linsheng has been idle and roams around outside, neglecting his work. Despite his father's repeated admonitions, he has not changed. Now, he has become even more brazen and not only neglects his family but also frequently demands money from his father. When he is refused, he scolds his father and is unfilial in every way. The day before, Linsheng again demanded money from his father and became violent, almost beating his father. His father, unable to bear it any longer, called the police yesterday and had his son arrested and taken to the Sixth District Police Station, accusing him of unfilial conduct and awaiting investigation.</p>
<h3>False Alarm Injures Man</h3>
<p>Zhu Zhongheng Severely Injured</p>
<p>Wu Chengcai Ordered to Provide Shop Guarantee</p>
<p>Zhu Zhongheng, a native of Changzhou, worked for lawyer Zhang Chongding. In August of last year, Zhu introduced a prostitute to Wu Chengle, the doorkeeper of Chen's residence at 4 Chongqing Road, whose brother is Wu Chengcai. After only a few months, the woman suddenly left without notice. Wu confronted Zhu for answers, but Zhu also went into hiding. Wu lost both money and the woman. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 5:00 PM, Wu Chengcai met Zhu Zhongheng at the intersection of South Chengdu Road and Xin Dagu Road and took him to Huabu at 346, intending to take him to the police station. Unexpectedly, Zhu managed to escape. Wu, unwilling to give up, immediately pursued him, blew the police whistle, and shouted, "Thief!" At that moment, Liu Longchao, Huabu 200 from the Xin Zha Police Station, passed by. Hearing the sound of a thief and seeing the chase, he also thought it was a thief and fired a shot. Zhu Zhongheng, who was running, fell to the ground. The bullet entered his right rib and exited his left rib. He and Wu Chengcai were taken to the police station. Zhu was sent to the hospital for treatment. The police chief detained Wu for falsely claiming there was a thief. This incident was reported in yesterday's newspaper, but because there were some discrepancies, it is reported again. It is known that Wu was handed over by the police station to the Special District Court yesterday morning, while Zhu could not be present due to his serious injuries. According to police lawyer Wang Yaotang, Zhu's life or death is currently uncertain, and he requested that the trial judge Sun Yuan order Wu to provide bail. Judge Sun then ruled that Wu Chengcai should provide a shop guarantee of 300 yuan and adjourned the case for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Killed by Car</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Xu Upholds Justice</p>
<p>Car Owner Compensates 200 Yuan</p>
<p>Li Xialin, from Jiangbei, was pulling an empty rickshaw outside the Shanghai Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road at 3:00 PM the day before. He was suddenly hit and crushed to death by car number 17571, driven by Qian Zhensheng, a driver for the Ha Te Car Company. Afterwards, the Xin Zha Police Station sent detectives to take the body to the Fielun Road Morgue for an autopsy. The car owner agreed to give the deceased's son 150 yuan in cash. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Xu to go to the morgue for an inspection. The deceased's son, Li Yikun, stated that since he had received compensation, he did not want to sue the driver. Prosecutor Xu then declared that in order to respect life and uphold humanity, 150 yuan was not enough for a life. Since the deceased was poor, the car owner should compensate at least 300 yuan. The car owner, Ha Te, requested a reduction, but Mr. Xu ruled that the car owner pay 200 yuan to the deceased's family. Li Yikun signed the receipt and took the body for burial.</p>
<h3>Car Accident Causes Death</h3>
<p>One Dead, One Critical</p>
<p>Avoiding Child, Injuries to Companion At around 6:30 AM yesterday morning, a truck with license number 16614, leased to Jian'an Transportation Company at 37 Minli Road, Zhabei, was driven by driver Jiang Shunxi from the French Concession's Xin Kai River to Shanghai North to load yellow sand and gravel. As they traveled toward the intersection of Fa Da Ma Lu at Dong Xin Bridge, the driver, Jiang Shunxi, caught sight of a child walking unsteadily on the road, no more than ten feet away. Fearing an accident, he slammed on the brakes. However, as the truck stopped abruptly, the body tilted slightly backward, and of the four or five workmen on the back, all fell to the ground sustaining minor injuries. One workman, however, fell headfirst onto the ground, fracturing his skull and bleeding profusely. His companions hoisted him into the truck and brought him to Renji Hospital on Tianzhutang Street. Doctors said that his life was in grave danger.</p>

<h3>Pessimism in the Cocoon and Silk Market</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Cocoon Production Reduced, Jiangsu Cocoon Production Unlikely to Be Bountiful</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Foreign Silk Market has seen a sharp decline in European sales of Chinese silk due to the surprisingly low prices of Japanese silk. New cocoons from inland areas are about to enter the market, but there is little trading activity for future new cocoons. Although Chinese merchants are willing to lower prices to sell, overseas telegrams are generally unresponsive. New cocoons from Zhejiang have begun to be shipped to Shanghai, but there is little trading activity for future cocoons, and there are no guidelines to follow. Female workers are having difficulty working. Old silk inventory is not being discounted and there are few inquiries. The business is precarious, and closures and machine reductions are occurring one after another. In the Jiangsu area, silkworm conditions in Yili, Jin Changxi Chengsu and other areas have been severely affected by weather changes during the crucial period of the major sleep period, including yellow sand, sultry heat, rain, thunder, and extreme cold, resulting in frequent silkworm diseases and significant losses. Cocoon production is bound to be poor. Zhejiang cocoon production, except for Hangzhou County where the harvest is still abundant, only has two to three tenths of a normal year's harvest in Shaoxing. The quality of the cocoons is poor, requiring about 700 catties of silk reeling. Manufacturers fear repeating the disaster of the Guihai year and have frequently been negotiating the separate cancellation of previously leased cocoon fields in various areas. New cocoons from various provinces of Jiangsu are expected to be on the market around the 20th. A bountiful harvest is unlikely. The number of cocoon merchants opening their doors will be less than in previous years, when there were thirteen, fourteen, or fifteen. The decline in the cocoon market is inevitable.</p>
<h3>News from the Shanghai Tin and Cocoon Industry Conference</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk and Cocoon General Association must convene a meeting of all silk and cocoon merchants to discuss cocoon purchasing procedures before the start of the spring cocoon season in Jiangsu. In previous years, the date of this general assembly preceded the Wuxi Cocoon Industry Conference. It has now been learned that the Wuxi Cocoon Industry Conference has been scheduled for the 18th of this month. Therefore, Huang Jinchen, chairman of the General Association, has scheduled a general meeting of all silk and cocoon merchants at 3:00 PM on the 17th, in addition to discussing cocoon purchasing issues, representatives will be publicly elected to attend the Wuxi Cocoon Industry Conference.</p>
<h3>National Government Approves the Placement of Workers in the Pharmaceutical Industry</h3>
<p>According to the Zhen Dan News Agency, the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Association petitioned the National Government yesterday regarding the placement of unemployed workers. The National Government issued the following instructions: "The petition has been noted. It was previously reported that representatives of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association had repeatedly petitioned and the Central Party Headquarters, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government, had ordered a swift resolution. It is now reported that the workers' union still has compulsory placement situations. If true, this is inappropriate. Investigating and mediating labor disputes cannot be resolved through compulsory actions, and the opening of this precedent will lead to many imitators, inevitably worsening the situation. In addition to following the instructions of the Central Party Headquarters and ordering the Shanghai Municipal Government to work with the Municipal Party Headquarters for a swift resolution, this notification should be made."</p>
<h3>National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association Sends Telegram to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Requesting that the Ministry of Education Explain the Nature of Medical Schools</p>
<p>The National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang yesterday, "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: Regarding the Ministry's order prohibiting Chinese medicine from establishing schools or hospitals from using Western equipment or drugs, which hinders the advancement of Chinese medicine, and the regulations for managing pharmaceutical merchants promulgated directly by the Ministry, which apply the same regulations to both Chinese and Western pharmaceutical merchants nationwide, causing difficulties for Chinese pharmaceutical merchants. We previously sent representatives to submit these concerns to your office, requesting separate cancellations and new revisions to safeguard Chinese medicine. The Ming Yu (Enlightened Decree) stated that previous Ministry orders prevented the advancement of Chinese medicine and violated Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions to preserve indigenous intelligence and carry it forward. The concerns should be sent to the Executive Yuan to instruct each Ministry to cancel the orders, and to the Legislative Yuan for reference." The telegram continued, "The entire nation is grateful, and the affiliated associations have requested the Legislative Yuan to form a committee to discuss Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical regulations in order to formulate new regulations. However, we recently read a Ministry of Education order stating that Chinese medicine schools should not be established and should be renamed medical research associations. The National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association is deeply concerned and has sent numerous letters and telegrams. We sent a telegram to the Ministry last month requesting clarification, but received no response. As the semester is about to end, we dare to attach the original telegram and earnestly request that you order the Ministry of Education to provide a prompt explanation so that everyone knows what to follow and so that students do not have to drop out halfway through their studies. The rise and fall of Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals are related to cultural and economic prosperity, and the decline of medicine will lead to the gradual loss of national essence. The stagnation of the pharmaceutical industry will reduce tax revenues and is closely related to national administration, with significant impact. We earnestly request that you solicit opinions widely and encourage and support initiatives that benefit the people and the nation. The National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association bows in gratitude."</p>
<h3>Lottery Drawing for Zhejiang Disaster Relief Charity Tickets Scheduled</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association, in order to raise funds for Zhejiang disaster relief, has decided that the lottery for its charity tickets will be held on June 15 in the main hall of the Ningbo Tongxiang Association. The first prize will be a Gold Ding worth 5,000 yuan, and the subsequent prizes will have corresponding gifts. All proceeds from the sale of the tickets will be allocated to various counties in Zhejiang for disaster relief. It has also been decided that the allocation method will be to discuss matters with the gentry and merchants of Taizhou and Wenzhou, as the disaster situations in these two prefectures are severe and ask them to make some preliminary funds available equal to one half of the lottery ticket sales target; In addition, Chairman Chiang donated 10,000 yuan to the association and asked the Chinese Jisheng Association to distribute it first. Xiangshan in Ningbo, Xinchang in Shaoxing, and Anji in Huzhou will each receive a subsidy of 5,000 yuan, which will also be entrusted to the Jisheng Association to select personnel for distribution; The remaining disaster-stricken counties will receive between 1,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan, depending on the severity of the disaster. It is thought that the disaster victims in each county are awaiting relief. Although this aid is only a drop in the bucket, it is not without some small benefit.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association's Disaster Relief Efforts in Chuxian County, Anhui</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association has repeatedly received reports from Chuxian County, Anhui Province, as well as from the County Disaster Relief Committee, stating that Chuxian County is located on a thoroughfare and has suffered repeated military disasters and banditry. In addition, the locust plague last year resulted in a very poor harvest. The urban and rural residents lack food, and eat grass roots and tree bark until there is nothing left. The disaster is severe, and more than 30,000 starving people cannot live. They asked for funds for disaster relief to alleviate the situation. The association immediately held a meeting and proposed that Anhui, as well as Yicheng, Wuhu, Huoqiu, Tianchang, Quanjiao, Hanshan, Hexian, Langxi, and a dozen other counties that needed assistance, had been sending applications. It was difficult to respond. It had received a list of disaster-stricken counties in northern Anhui from the Anhui Provincial Relief Committee, which included twenty counties in northern Anhui alone, not counting the southern and central Anhui provinces. The disaster area was too large, and the number of disaster-stricken counties had exceeded half of the province. Research found that it was impossible to handle. The association had been providing disaster relief to seven provinces, and its resources were exhausted. It had been fundraising repeatedly but had been unsuccessful. It could only choose the most important ones, such as the previously provided disaster relief for Xuancheng and Wuhu, to at least fulfill its conscience. Now, it has publicly appointed Mr. Xia Fuyi as the director of disaster relief in Chuxian County and sent him with friends to handle it. He departed a few days ago. The association's funds are meager, and its resources are limited, making it difficult to reach everyone. It can only appeal to all of its Anhui counterparts to help each other and work together to save lives in order to try to recover from the disaster.</p>

<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, three robbers suddenly appeared in the clothing store at 7 Puqing Lane, Brenier de Montmorand in the French Concession. They showed handguns to intimidate those inside and told them not to make a sound. It is estimated that they robbed gold rings and clothing worth about 90 yuan and then fled. The owner reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>

<h3>News from the Tobacco Exchange Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Reorganization Committee, in view of the rising foreign exchange rates and the increasing cost of living, believes that the selling prices of goods among its members should be unified to facilitate business operations.

<h3>Gu Binglin Sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for Placement</h3>
<p>Gu Binglin, a 12-year-old boy from Pudong, was apprenticing at a shoe store outside Xiaonanmen. Due to constant beatings, he secretly ran away the night before and his whereabouts were unknown. He was found wandering near the Sea God Temple at Fengji Wharf by Liu Shenghui, a guard from the 27th post in the area, who, realizing he was lost, took him to the First Precinct of the First District. After questioning by the precinct chief, he was ordered to be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for placement.</p>

<h3>Yao Menghun's Lecture on China's Treasure: Awakening from Confusion</h3>
<p>The 11th of this month was the date of the fourth gathering of the Can Yi Society. The Can Yi Society was initiated by Zhu Rongjing’s respected father, Mr. Zijun, and is dedicated to expounding the principles of the Book of Changes. On that day, it was held at the Heshou Hall upstairs in the City God Temple. Members such as Ye Liwen and Yao Menghun were either famous figures or scholars, so they had a very deep understanding of the principles of the Book of Changes and had special insights. On this day, members gathered for dinner in the evening and casually discussed the principles of the Book of Changes. Mr. Yao Menghun said that the Hetu and Luoshu in our country are truly the treasures of our country. Since the discovery of the Hetu and Luoshu in our country, we have had image studies, mathematical principles, and writing. Therefore, the invention of image studies, mathematical principles, and writing in our country all relied on the Hetu and Luoshu. Today, the various sciences of European and American countries are actually the image studies of our country. European and American countries have made progress in their various sciences to the point where they say that the people of our country have no scientific thought or scientific invention. They do not know that the invention of science in our country was before the invention of mathematical principles and writing in ancient times, and that our image studies, mathematical principles, and writing all came from the Hetu and Luoshu, and the secrets of the Hetu and Luoshu are all obtained by expounding the principles of the Book of Changes. Therefore, since the Hetu and Luoshu are the treasures of our country, not expounding the principles of the Book of Changes is equivalent to abandoning our own treasures. The initiation of the Can Yi Society today is of great value. Those in our country who speak of the Book of Changes have three kinds: change, immutability, and simplicity. If we take the four seasons as an example, from spring to summer, from summer to autumn, from autumn to winter, this is change. After winter, it returns to spring and is still spring, summer, autumn, and winter, which is immutability. No matter how change, it seems extremely complicated when it is not understood, but it feels very simple after it is understood. This is simplicity. Today, European and American countries only know that there is change, but do not know that there is immutability, and do not even know that there is simplicity outside of immutability. Therefore, if the people of our country expound the principles of the Book of Changes and invent science, they can advance a thousand miles in a day and surpass Europe and America. To expound the principles of the Book of Changes, we can only seek it in the Hetu and Luoshu. Therefore, the Hetu and Luoshu are truly the treasures of our China. There is nothing else that can be called a treasure.</p>
<h3>Red Bean Trivia An</h3>
<p>Red bean, also known as acacia bean, is red, moist, and dripping. The flower color is like a catalpa pod, as small as a pagoda tree pod. It bears one fruit every few years. In the past, the White Dove Zen Master of Dongchan Temple in Wumen accidentally picked up a red bean and planted it in the temple, pointing to it and instructing it, "You should grow quickly, but don't open flowers for no reason one day. There are major and minor changes in the world, so the flowers bloom sparsely or densely." See Niu Xiu's Gusan. Today, the ruins of Dongchan Temple are unknown, but the red bean tree still exists and has actually returned to our home. The place is probably near Fengmen. If Qian Muzhai's red bean villa tree is in Yushan, I heard that it was originally the villa of the Gu family of Baimao, called Furong Villa. The villa originally had red bean trees, which later belonged to the Qian family and was renamed. When Muzhai was eighty years old in a certain year, the flowers happened to bloom, and everyone thought it was auspicious. Several decades after Muzhai passed away, the flowers bloomed again, but the villa had been destroyed, and only the trees remained in the fields. Only this tree is rare and still preserved. It is said that there are only three trees in the world. One is in Changshu, which is the so-called Red Bean Villa. One is in Suzhou, which is our family's property. One is in Wenzhou, but there is no record to be verified. Gusan also recorded that in the past, a resentful woman looked forward to her husband's return every day and shed tears under the tree, and the blood dyed its branches, which then formed into seeds. This is the origin of acacia beans. It is said that the begonia is transformed from the tears of a thinking woman to embellish it. Tang Wang Wei's poem says: "Red beans grow in the south, and several branches sprout in spring. I wish you would pick more of them, for this thing is the most longing." Poets entrust objects to express their feelings, which cannot be regarded as facts. Only its bright red fruit is lovely enough to play with and can be given to old friends. At the end of the world, getting this is enough to comfort longing. Our family's red bean tree blooms every leap year, and bears hundreds of fruits every time it blooms. Although there are many stored, they are as precious as jade. In the past, Mr. Yuan Bao founded the Red Bean News, and I loved its elegant naming. However, after reading it for less than a few issues, it was suspended, and I still regret it today. Mr. Yuan loved this head and once asked a certain gentleman to bring a letter to ask for it, and I gave him a few of them with great generosity. His letter was quite happy and proud. I once wrote a poem about it, saying: "Born in the south like coral branches, bearing fruit is incredibly strange. Those who are affectionate often cherish love, and are too lazy to send longing by hand. Picking parrot grains, three points of jealousy, the heart penetrates the rhinoceros spirit a little bit quickly. But it is picked together in pairs, and it is even more taught to love more than the red girl." Borrowing red beans for Li Shangyin's Brocade Zither, readers understand this. Tying this trivia is enough to be handed down with the red beans. (Returning the favor)</p>
<p>Xu Qizhong, also known as Tao An, is a young and promising man with a profound knowledge of both Chinese and Western cultures. He is skilled in poetry and has a good nature for national arts. He is also good at planting. There are red bean trees in his garden, which are rare in the world. I received two of them as a gift, which are scarlet and lovely, and worthy of treasure. Rui Hongchu attached a note.</p>
<h3>New Yuefu Opera Reviewing Sheng Lao Xuan</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was the opening night of the Yong Tuan Yuan organized by the New Yuefu Opera. I was invited by a friend and arrived at the Great World at 9:30 PM. There were no empty seats. Many people in the audience carried integrated scores, which shows that the elegant art is turning from decline to prosperity. The descendant of the previous dynasty, Liu Gonglu, also stood in the crowd with his braid, unable to find a seat for a long time, which shows that its revival is not shallow.</p>
<p>In the play, Gu Chuanjie played Cai Sheng, and Wen Yingzhu Fuming played the eldest daughter of Jiang Nazhi, Lanfang. The main characters were well-chosen and performed brilliantly. I haven't seen Chuanjie's face for a long time, and he has become plump and spirited, completely different from before. His voice is smooth and natural, almost comparable to the famous young actor Yu Junzhenfei.</p>
<p>Chuanjie held a banquet and the actors presented scrolls and plaques, almost everywhere. There were also some who sent them together with Fuming. Many famous masters and legal figures, such as lawyers Li Zuyu and Chen Tingrui, were among them. The gifts were dazzling and too numerous to record. Only the recluse Su Juxie gave Chuanjie a couplet saying: "Singing with gentle grace, poetry spreads elegance, turning it into a song. Wei Jie's beauty, the characters are like the Xixia Song." I don't know who wrote it.</p>
<p>The segment of singing "Old Woman Ma" is fast-paced, the tone is sad, and the meaning is extremely decadent. When matched with the drumming hall, it changes into innocence and uninhibitedness, and the face-to-face confrontation with Jiang Na is extremely humorous and slippery. It is no wonder that the applause from the audience was thunderous. Fuming's demeanor is quiet and beautiful, her stage steps are stable, and her singing and enunciation are clear and rhythmic, which is very different from the female roles in Beijing opera. She is a famous and precious actor. The reunion scene with Chuanjie is magnificent and seamless, and can be said to be perfect. The audience's spirits remained high until the end, which shows that art has indeed reached its peak. Do not say that there are no appreciative listeners in the world.</p>
<p>Common Sense for Watching Movies Zheng Yimei</p>
<h3>Excerpts from Travels in America at Zhuiyu Xuan Lai</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (22nd) was the last day of performing in New York. Almost the whole city knew that the Mei Troupe was leaving. Everyone came to reserve seats. The aisles were full of people. It was truly a sea of people, a pit full of people. Standing room tickets were sold out. Now, no one in the minds of Americans does not know Mei Lanfang. The story of the palace maids assassinating the tiger when the Ming Dynasty fell, in particular, no one does not know. A few days ago, a Romanian painter (world-famous) came to the United States to paint a portrait of Wanhua assassinating the tiger. The skirt was high, the hair was scattered, the hand was holding a sharp blade, and the face showed a determined and tragic expression. This artist said, "With my pen, I can write out Mr. Mei's art. The two kinds of art combine to form a great work that will be passed down for thousands of generations and can be said to be immortal." The last day's repertoire included "Nao Xue," "Qingshi Mountain," "Mulan Joins the Army," and "Stabbing the Tiger." The audience welcomed "Nao Xue" very much because it was easy to understand. However, "Stabbing the Tiger" had already been widely spread and was considered the highest and most supreme art. Two companies had already filmed short clips for wide publicity. After the performance the day before yesterday, they requested to make a five-color film of a few minutes, but no compensation was accepted. After the curtain fell, the audience requested to shake hands. There were too many people and the order was feared to be disrupted, so a long table was set up on the stage. Wanhua stood behind the table, and those who wanted to see him entered in an orderly manner from the lower stage door and exited from the upper stage door. There were about 400 people, men, women, old and young. Those who had already shaken hands still stood there, and there were still countless people who had not come. Wanhua's hands were red and swollen. There was no way but to drop the curtain on the stage, and the people gradually dispersed. It was truly an unprecedented grand occasion. If the situation at that time was filmed and brought back to the motherland, then everyone would know that Wanhua had won supreme honor overseas.</p>
<p>The fires in the movies are mostly fake. From a distance, the flames seem to burn a mansion to ashes, but it's just burning a small model. Don't believe what the advertisements say, thinking it's a big sacrifice.</p>
<p>In a gambling den scene, the money is flying around in the thousands and tens of thousands. Don't think the film company is really rich and generous. Actually, the money is all from the underworld bank, where you can buy hundreds of bills for one dollar.</p>
<p>Don't think the characters in martial arts movies really have great skills. If there were such people, why wouldn't the government hire them to quell internal strife and resist foreign enemies? Actually, jumping onto the roof is filmed in reverse. Climbing onto the roof and jumping down is like jumping up on the roof in general. Flying is done with wires. Even the sword fights in the air are done with ropes. To put it bluntly, there's nothing rare about it. The horse doesn't move, but it looks like it's flying. The car doesn't move, but it looks like it's flying. Actually, the background is painted. By rolling the painted background, it feels like the horse is flying and the car is driving away.</p>
<p>The wind and rain in the play are created by spraying tap water and turning on an electric fan to blow it hard. Snowing is even easier, just sprinkle some white paper scraps. Otherwise, how could the wind, rain, and snow be so coincidental and random in nature?</p>
<p>When the curtains and curtains in a bedroom are fluttering, you know that the scene was filmed outdoors. That film company is simple and crude and doesn't have a glass shed.</p>
<p>When an actress is acting in a very dangerous place, she is mostly replaced by a male actor. If it's a long shot or doesn't show the front of the face, then it's a bit unreliable. Don't boast about her high skills.</p>
<p>Notes on British Art Studies (Part 2) Wang Yachen</p>
<p>3 Royal Academy The Academy held an exhibition of Italian masterpieces from early February to mid-March this year. The architecture is magnificent and the interior is spacious, surpassing the Academy of Fine Arts in Paris. Introduced by a friend, I went to visit. The equipment in the Academy is perfect and can be called a school of art. The second floor on the right displays a large number of paintings. In addition to the famous works of previous professors, the rest are the best works of students. There are also several sketches by the Italian Vinci, which are rare even in art museums around the world. The exterior of the display room collects the palettes of famous European painters, which combines memorial and research significance and is extremely precious.</p>
<p>The British attach great importance to the tradition of art, especially the painting style of the academy. The skills are still inherited and are all inclined to the description of form. There is no talk of the expressionist school popular in modern Paris. Even the impressionist paintings are not very popular in today's Britain. New style paintings are popular in Germany and France, but the British do not want to adopt them. The British are deeply influenced by the concept of the academy school. I observed that only one British modern painter is John. The British are particularly good at portrait painting, but they lack lively vitality.</p>
<p>4 British Spring Watercolor Exhibition Since the 18th century, the great landscape painter Turner has inherited the skill of depicting the natural world for a long time. Watercolor painting is the most exquisite in the UK, and it also started with Turner and continues to be studied today. On this trip, I happened to attend the exhibition held by the Royal Watercolor Society of the United Kingdom. I went to visit London the next day after arriving. After visiting, I felt that the impression I gained was very different from what I had imagined in the past. A total of more than 1,200 paintings were displayed. Except for a few that were more interesting, the rest were inherited skills. The inherited skills emphasize fine depiction of the surface and lack profound content. Only the works in the association are mostly sold, which shows the importance attached by the general appreciators. If it is in Paris, inherited watercolor paintings are not popular and are not often seen. The British regard art as only knowing the excellent and the object's photorealistic, far less than the Germans and French who turn to the advancement of the times.</p>
<p>5 The British Museum This museum is located in the center of London. The museum displays the literary and scientific products of countries around the world, which is extremely complete. The breadth of the museum and the collection can be called the first in the world. I visited for four hours and only saw a corner of the painting section. The museum's collection of paintings is divided into two parts: European and Oriental. European paintings have no oil paintings, all sketches, and collect the works of famous artists from the Renaissance to the modern era, almost without omissions. Sketches by Raphael Vinci, etc., are arranged in a special room, and the arrangement is extremely neat, making people linger. The last two large rooms are more exquisitely decorated and the light is also very suitable, specially displaying Chinese and Japanese paintings. Japanese paintings are far inferior to Chinese paintings in terms of ancient times, so they are omitted. In the center of the wall are three female Buddha statues painted on slate. According to the explanation, they were discovered in Zhili Province and are objects of the Tang Dynasty. The structure of the characters, the clothes, and the demeanor are indeed undoubtedly from the Tang Dynasty. The colors are still distinguishable, and they are truly masterpieces.</p>
<p>Song Dynasty anonymous (white lotus) a painting with vigorous brushstrokes and excellent composition, which is not comparable to the works of recent people.</p>
<p>Yu Zhiding (lady) a painting with detached brushstrokes and floating charm, an outstanding work in Chinese painting.</p>
<p>Qiu Ying (figure hand scroll) a shaft of meticulous brushwork with no special features.</p>
<p>The museum's display of Chinese paintings, in addition to the above-mentioned masterpieces, has many counterfeit products. Among them, a hand scroll of Gu Kaizhi's "Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies" makes us most valuable to study. The British collection of Gu's paintings is world-famous. Gu Kaizhi's true works were lost early in China and are worthy of treasure. The original painting is twelve feet long and one foot two inches high, and is divided into eight sections. Each section describes the text. At the end of the scroll are the four characters "Gu Kaizhi's Painting". There are fourteen seals on the right side and eighteen seals on the left side. There are a total of sixty-two seals in the whole picture. The figures in this painting are all in proportion, the clothes and belts are naturally hooked, and the facial lines are soft and strong. The front and back of the clothing folds are distinct. Recalling that in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Japanese painter Hirafuku Hyakusui exhibited a painting (Yu Rang Tu) at the Tokyo Imperial Exhibition, which was based on this painting.</p>
<p>Gu Kaizhi was a Jin Dynasty person who lived from 364 years after Jesus to 405 years after Jesus, separated from the present by 1,525 years. After studying this painting, I have the following doubts: (1) After more than 1,500 years, the original painting is not damaged (2) The painting silk is delicate like that of the Qing Dynasty (3) The vermilion color is bright and dazzling (4) The ink color of the third character (zhi) in the title at the end of the scroll is dark black and seems to have been added again</p>
<p>A Japanese book (A Treatise on Ancient Chinese Painting) mentioned that Gu's painting is also suspected of being a counterfeit product. Chinese paintings passed down for more than 1,500 years are almost impossible. Because the materials of Chinese paintings are not as durable as Western paintings, counterfeit products are often confused with the real thing in the past. That is to say, the fake products in the museum's exhibition occupy three out of ten. Europeans appreciate our country's ancient paintings just as Chinese people view the authenticity of European ancient paintings as difficult to distinguish. However, I have not dared to say that the "Admonitions of the Instructress to the Court Ladies" exhibited in the museum this time is a true work of Gu Kaizhi.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Rise Continues Strong</h3>
<p>Unprecedented High Peak</p>
<p>526.8 Taels</p>
<p>Great Fluctuations and Active Trading Yesterday, the gold price rose sharply and relentlessly, reaching a new unprecedented high of over 526 taels. However, the fluctuations were significant, with ups and downs of as much as 4 taels. People remained resilient, and the foreign exchange rate was relatively stable. The market was still bustling. Heng Xing, Sheng Da, Zhi Feng Yong, and others were selling, while Shun Li, Yuan Mao Yong, Fu Xing Yong, Xiang Yu, and others were buying. However, many firms were entering and exiting frequently, likely squaring off positions as the settlement date approached for both bulls and bears. The morning market continued to see strong buying on dips, causing the trend to rise. Subsequently, drafts were quite popular, once reaching a new peak of 526.8 taels. Afterward, sellers became active, and drafts loosened, causing a sudden downturn of two or three taels. Later, Da Lian Gang and Xiang Yu, among others, showed strong buying interest, while Zhi Feng Yong and Heng Xing were selling. The market then fluctuated slightly by two taels, seeming to stabilize. Finally, it settled at just over 525 taels. The recent silver bar prices in London decreased by one-eighth for spot and one-sixteenth for forward delivery, with no further changes in the silver price.</p>
<p>Prices rose steadily after the opening. The initial gold price for June opened at 522.9 taels, only increasing by one qian. The gross price gradually rose by 2.0 taels, from 22.8 taels to 5 taels. Drafts were also strong. The silver price against spot US dollars was 44.9375 yuan. HSBC absorbed spot British gold at 10 pence 25, then suppressed it by one shilling. The announced price remained unchanged at 24 taels 6 qian. Internally, Mitsui was still planning to absorb July at 10 pence 375. Later, Taiwan offered 10 pence 25, which HSBC accepted at a forward price of 10 pence 4375. With strong buying sentiment in the market, the price jumped by more than 2 taels and 10 points, reaching 26 taels and 8 qian. However, given the high market price, various parties took the opportunity to sell, and drafts seemed to be leveling off. Mitsui bought spot at 10 pence 25 and also bought June Japanese gold at 1.09625 taels. This caused a sudden softening, dropping abruptly by more than 3 taels and 10 points to 23.5 taels. After an hour, it added more than 1 tael, totaling 5 taels and 23 qian, as Zheng Jin bought July at 10 pence 3125. However, the selling pressure continued, remaining on the downside. At midday, it was 3 taels and 78 qian, and at the close, it was 4 taels and 3 qian.</p>
<p>The after-market closed at 25.3 taels. The after-market opened at 24.9 taels, then at 5.1 taels. Buyers were relentless. Later, it weakened slightly by several qian to 24.5 taels. After 2:30 PM, Wan Xing, Shun Li, and others actively bought, causing the Japanese gold price to rise. San Zhou advanced May by 1 tael and 1 qian, also buying British gold at 10 pence 1875 and selling Da Lian at 1.09875 taels. This caused a jump of about 2 taels and 3 points to 26.7 taels. Afterward, Da Lian Gang again sold heavily, with sellers dominating. It suddenly fell by 2 taels. After 4:00 PM, it was 4 taels and 89 qian. As the market closed, there were slightly more buyers, pulling the price up by several qian to 525.3 taels, an increase of 2.5 taels compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The entire market fluctuated by 4 taels. The highest price during the day was 26.8 taels, and the lowest price was 22.8 taels, a fluctuation of 4 taels. Spot Japanese gold can be settled at 1.0975 taels, and British gold is priced at 10 pence 1875, announced at 535.8 taels, a discount of more than 11 taels. The after-market is still discounted by 11 taels, with June registration at 24 taels and replenishment at 26 to 27 taels. Early morning goods opened at 22.9 taels, midday closed at 4.5 taels, and afternoon closed at 5.4 taels. Guang Gang continued to sell. The supply and demand of each firm varied. Fu Chang, Yuan Cheng Yong, Shun Li, Wan Li, and others were intermittently entering and exiting. Yu Da, Fu Yu, Fu Xing Yong, Cheng Feng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Yong Feng, Ju Chang, Xiang Feng, and others were buying. Tai Xing, Da De Cheng, Heng Xing, Sheng Da, Da Yu Yong, Sen Chang Yong, and others were generally selling. In the afternoon, Fu Chang, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Yuan Tai, and others bought and then sold. Zhi Feng Yong, Tai Xing, and Yong Feng sold. Yuan Mao Yong, Xiang Yu, Chun Fa Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, and others were buying. Da Lian Gang traded about 8,000 contracts throughout the day, with hundreds of contracts bought overall. Guang Gang still sold two to three thousand contracts, it is said.</p>
<p>Today, long positions in swaps require payment. Today (16th), the exchange began trading in July, so it opened one hour early at 8:00 AM. Long positions in swaps generally require payment.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rate Clearly Defined but Secretly Tight</h3>
<p>Chinese Merchants Mostly Settling</p>
<p>Yesterday, the British and Indian silver markets continued to decline. However, silver and exchange rates did not fluctuate, and the European market was oversupplied, preventing prices from rising further. Yokohama and Kobe remained unchanged. HSBC's foreign exchange rates were the same as the revised rates from the previous day. However, the domestic market was initially flat but tightened later. At midday, it returned to flat. In the afternoon, the trend seemed to tighten. There were slight fluctuations throughout the day, as the gold market fluctuated by four taels. As a result, Chinese merchants were actively trading, mostly settling. About 100,000 pounds of British gold were purchased, sold by Shanghai Sumitomo, Taiwan Mitsui, Maehsing, and others. Occasionally, five to six thousand qian were also sold, absorbed by Mitsui and Zheng Jin. Various banks were also actively engaging in interbank trading. HSBC's purchase of treasury bills was good. US dollars were sold by Mei Fengda, absorbed by Mitsui, totaling more than 100,000 yuan. A small number of Chinese merchants sold. The Japanese exchange rate had settled over one million yuan. Banks such as Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Datong had strong selling intentions. Sentiment seemed to be strengthening, and the market atmosphere was also improving. As a result, each exchange rate compared to the previous day (14th) saw the shilling decrease by 0.125, the US dollar decrease by only 0.0625, and the Japanese exchange rate increase by 0.0625.</p>
<p>The domestic US dollar market fluctuated by 0.125. In the morning, the May offer price was one shilling and ten pence 25, June 3125, July 375, and August 4375. The bid price added 0.0625.

<h3>Massive Decline in Silver Bars Continues</h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London telegrams, the price of silver bars continued to fall, with spot prices down 0.125 and forward prices down 0.0625, both at 19 pence 0625 (equivalent to one shilling and ten pence 5625 in British gold). Both China and India were selling, with few buyers. The market was flat. New York telegrams indicated that the US silver price remained unchanged at 41.125 cents.

The British-to-Shanghai shilling decreased by 0.125 to one shilling and ten pence and a half. The Bombay spot price decreased by 12 ounces to 54 rupees 2 ounces. Reuters and the Telecommunications Agency sent telegrams with no notable ups or downs. The market situation was extremely sluggish.</p>
<h3>Securities Traded Flat, "96" Bonds Decline</h3>
<p>In the Beiping morning market, the "96" spot bonds opened at 159, rose to 161, fell to 157, and closed at 157.5, with a turnover of 485,000. In the afternoon market, they opened at 158.5 and closed at 159.25, with a turnover of 285,700. The "7 Long" spot bonds were at 82.95, with a turnover of 5,000 (15th).</p>
<h3>Bond Market Still Active</h3>
<p>Prices Down Slightly, Turnover in the Millions</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local Shanghai securities market, there were many types of government bonds available for spot trading, but the volume was very low. The futures market was active in the morning, with a turnover of over 5.4 million yuan. It was slightly flatter in the afternoon, but still had a turnover of over 4 million. Regarding the price changes of each bond, because the prices of each bond had previously risen significantly in recent days, many market participants were actively selling to lock in profits. Large players were also selling off their positions at high prices, resulting in strong buying activity in the market, but the supply-demand situation was slightly flatter. The market prices fluctuated and did not rise or fall significantly, except for a slight weakness in the morning session. Otherwise, they remained relatively stable. As a result, the "Full 6" bonds fell by one yuan, which was the largest decline. Military Disbandment and Reorganization bonds also fell slightly, by six or seven jiao. Most other bonds only fluctuated by a few jiao. The following is a comparison of the opening and closing prices of each bond in the futures and spot markets, as well as the turnover compared to the previous day:</p>

<p>Cigarette Spot 20.00 ... No Market 1,000</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Lifeless</h3>
<p>The yarn market was unremarkable. Both sides remained firm, resulting in a lack of activity. Outsiders viewed this stalemate and were helpless, so business was extremely quiet. Daily fluctuations in the opening market prices were only three to five qian. New transactions were halted. However, overseas cotton and yarn were consistently weakening. The price of third-grade yarn was falling sharply, but this had no impact on the local market due to a lack of business. Based on the overall situation, it is difficult to see prices rising.</p>
<p>The price of yarn futures was rising for nearby months and falling for distant months. In the exchange, bids were flat in the morning, but there were few sellers in the market. Although foreign cotton prices fell, the drastic decline in drafts led some retail investors to cover their short positions, causing a rise of one qian in nearby months and a fall of 1, 2, or 3 qian in distant months. The market situation remained unchanged in the afternoon. The current month held steady, while distant months rebounded by 1 or 2 qian. However, third-grade yarn fell sharply, with a drop of 150 yuan in the current month. The total turnover of inland transactions throughout the day was 4,300 bales. The closing prices of the bids are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Human Clock Rise/Fall Inventory Closing Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>May 15273 1650 August 1536 Up 12 1700</p>
<p>June 1529 Up 2 1600 September 1542 Down 2 1700</p>
<p>July 1532 17050 October 1546 26400</p>
<p>Sales of spot yarn to Guangdong were still good. The total purchase volume by various gangs throughout the day was 1,200 bales. Internal sales accounted for 450 bales. Prices for Japanese yarn fell by 2.5 qian. The largest volume, 680 bales, was purchased by Guangdong. In addition, 240 bales were purchased by the mainland, 45 bales by Qinhuangdao, 45 bales by Shantou, 136 bales by Yunnan, 20 bales by Hankou, and 35 bales by mixed gangs.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Particularly Weak in the Near Term</h3>
<p>The situation in the cotton market was slightly overcast as the price of American cotton trended downward, softening sentiment. However, the Hankou gang and buyers remained firm, unwilling to concede, so the market situation was still good. However, there was talk that the Japanese merchant Dongmian Yanghang had delivered 10,000 dan of ginning machine cotton, so the market situation was quite weak in the current month. Those who were long in distant months were holding firm due to the drastic decline in drafts. The future of a certain manufacturer who was short in distant months still depends on American cotton.</p>
<p>The Hankou bid was slightly loose as long positions were closed. The market atmosphere was flat at the opening in the morning. Following the decline in foreign cotton by 5 fen, distant months were flat. In the afternoon, some long positions were closed, and the market atmosphere suddenly loosened, with each falling by 5 fen to 1 qian. The total turnover for the day was 14,200 dan. The closing prices of Hankou cotton are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Hankou Bid Closing Rise/Fall Inventory 73550 63600</p>
<p>53505 Down 1 579600 83550 Down 1 054500</p>
<p>63525 1571000 93475 22200</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales remained sluggish. Business in the market had not yet developed. Each factory had absorbed enough Indian cotton, and there was a severe shortage of source transactions. Tong Hua cotton accounted for 241 bales, and Yao Hua cotton accounted for 250 bales. The sales record is on the left:</p>
<p>Dongtai Hua 35.80, with Sulun purchasing 500 bales for spot exchange.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Fell in Unison</h3>
<p>American cotton growing area has obtained rain. Yesterday, American cotton fell because of bad news from Liverpool, the drought area obtained rain, and buyers decreased. The futures contract fell 19-25 pounds, and the spot contract fell 20 pounds. English cotton futures fell 12-14 points, and spot contracts fell 3 points. Egyptian cotton fell 10 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram recorded on the left (14th telegram):</p>

<p>May 149.50 Down 3.60 September 156.40 Down 3.20</p>

<h3>The Price of Rice in the Lower Reaches of the River is Rising Steadily</h3>
<p>White Japonica Rice is Up Another Two Jiao</p>
<p>Yesterday, very few boats arrived in the Zhabei inland, and the inventory in the lower reaches of the river was less than 100. Although sales in the market were in the latter half of the month, buying interest was active. High-quality northern japonica rice was firm due to scarcity. However, buyers were currently focused on ordinary japonica rice, so the price rose another two jiao. Overall, it was nearly half a yuan higher in two days. There was no longer any old stored polished rice, so fresh arrivals were also extremely popular. The overall market also followed and rose. Transactions in the thin rice market were still slow, and buying sentiment was quiet. Prices were still firm. There was slight arrival of yangjian rice. Store sales were cautious and tight. There were no notable ups or downs in the near corner white yuan rice.</p>
<p>About ten boats arrived at the South Shanghai River. Sales in this area were smooth. Transactions were only active for high-quality Changxi white japonica rice, and lower-quality rice was still not being traded because the sales market was flat. Near-term arrivals of Suzhou-Tongji polished rice were very scarce, and merchants took the opportunity to raise prices, so the market trend also saw an increase. Arrivals of South Gang thin early rice were slow to sell, and the Ningbo market was stagnant, so the overall market was flat and weak. However, top-quality rice was still stable. Yangdu and other pointed rice varieties were quiet due to the pressure of foreign rice. The sale of Tongbian yinyuan rice had some inquiries, and the supply of goods was recently reported to be scarce. Only a small amount of Du rice arrived, so prices turned firm.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Selling Pressure Suddenly Increased</h3>
<p>Slightly Weakening</p>
<p>Yesterday, all months in the flour market saw a moderate trend. Although there was no action from the factories, there was a lot of floating interest outside the industry, with no fixed views. In terms of recent increases, based on the lowest price, the near term has reached seven or eight fen. With this float profit within a week, it seemed that they were satisfied. Therefore, after the opening, many floating interests sold their positions, and the market showed a weak trend. For distant months, because the weather was very sunny and it was predicted that the wheat seedlings would be abundant, and because the quotation for foreign wheat was reduced, sentiment was soft and selling pressure increased. However, in terms of the overall situation, the factory attitude was still to maintain the previous trend, and it was not easy for it to be suppressed too much. As a result, the current month was lower by 0.75 li compared to the previous day, July was lower by 0.5 li, August was lower by 0.25 li, September was lower by 0.75 li, and there was no comparison for October.</p>
<h3>With Sunny Weather, the Wheat Market Looks Small</h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures turned small again because the price of foreign wheat was small (one jiao in a place) and the weather was unusually good. Although the Xibang attitude was still firm to the end, the Jiangbei and Nanjing gangs all saw that the wheat seedlings were developing very well, and the new harvest was only about two sentences away. Therefore, they all had a small outlook on the future of the wheat market, because the new goods stalls once a year seemed to have to soften a little in fact. As a result, June was 0.2 fen lower than the previous day, July was 0.3 fen lower, and August was 0.1 fen lower. There were no comparisons for September and October. Spot wheat also tended to be stable. Only Fuxin Factory was more greedy, and everyone else was waiting and watching. Bengbu wheat opened at 5.1 taels, Suzhou wheat at 5 taels 1 qian, Hankou wheat at 4.5 taels to 5 taels 5 qian, and Shashi wheat at 4 taels 6 qian 3 fen. A total of 2,000 packages were opened and handled by Fuxin Fufeng, it is said.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Cocoons in Hangzhou are Abundant and of Good Quality</h3>
<p>Overall Harvested at 80%, About 600 Jin Wound. In the old Hangzhou Prefecture areas such as Gaosi, Sanbao, Linping, Pingyao, Changle Bridge, and Jinjianong, this year farmers who raised improved silkworm breeds accounted for 70-80%. Although the weather was not conducive to breeding, the results were quite good. The overall harvest of new cocoons was 80% of normal, and the cocoon quality was also excellent, with winding around 600 jin. The initial cocoon price was 50-56 yuan, but due to heavy rain, it declined. Yesterday, the weather had cleared, and the cocoon market returned to its original state. Each firm was actively purchasing goods, and high-quality goods were expected to sell for 58-60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Tea Market Collapses</h3>
<p>Since the new green tea from local tea farmers entered the market in the local tea market, the number of fine eyebrows produced by each tea factory has been no less than 3,000 boxes, and the amount of sales has only been 600 boxes. Hundreds of boxes of fine eyebrows from Wenzhou have already been released. The new market was also not opened for early sampling, which led to a decline in confidence. The market had a tendency to collapse. The reason for the sluggish sales in the current market is that the inventory of Chinese tea in Morocco is too thick, and the merchants who purchased foreign tea last year suffered heavy losses due to the high purchase price. Therefore, even though the current shilling exchange rate is suitable, foreign tea merchants are still waiting and watching. The green tea market does not seem to have any development prospects at present, it is said.</p>
<h3>The First Weighing of New Wuyuan Tea</h3>
<p>Twenty Yuan Higher Than Last Year</p>
<p>New Wuyuan tea has been in production since the opening of the gardens for ten days. Tea from the southwest village has been picked and produced early, and recently they have been harvested. The rest are also rushing to pick to avoid old leaves. According to the tea master, the tea produced this year has been delayed due to excessive rainfall, and most of the mountain households are slow to produce tea. There is quite a bit of old grass. Those picked before the Beginning of Summer still have fine goods to take. Those picked later can only be used to make tribute ceremony offerings and have no raw materials. The tea number initially wanted to suppress prices, but now, in view of the reduced tea production and increased costs for mountain households, the Tunxi tea number has instead released prices to attract customers. The illusion of suppressing prices has become hopeless, so various numbers have recently contacted mountain households for negotiations. However, the new tea in the northeastern villages has not yet been completed, and the buyers believe that the time to offer a bid is not yet right, so they rarely comply. Zhangcun Jinyuanji Tea Number in the north village believes that this year's tea production is sparse, and Zhenmei needs to be selected, so yesterday (7th) it first bought dozens of dans of new tea before the Beginning of Summer in Shicun Yuan, Daicun, and Licun, and the negotiated price was set at 80 yuan per dan, which was 20 yuan higher than last year. This is the highest record for Wucha mountain prices. The southwest village offered only 70 yuan. At the moment, various numbers have dispatched staff to negotiate with mountain households one after another, and it is expected that there will be a very intense competition in the opening weighing by major gangs.</p>
<h3>Of Piece Goods, Civilized Linen is in the Most Severe Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of piece goods were still quiet. The Hankou gang stopped purchasing after a period of purchasing, and the market was flat and firm. Qiuxiang Yuanyang yarn is expected to arrive in Shanghai next week. Some have already been sold at the public assembly at 8.45 taels. The printed linen yarn with inferior patterns has been sold off in large quantities in recent days. The price ranges from 1.55 fen to 1.7 fen. The stores in this street have quite a bit of transactions. Shangshen Ronghua Fugui is still at 2.3 qian. Wushile fine cloth is also out of stock. Futures opened at 7.75 taels. Civilized linen was unanimously sold at 1.525 fen yesterday. Of all the goods this year, this good is the most severely declining. Each piece has fallen by about 40 taels. Fine broadcloth, Baogui, and Huxinting blue-gray are out of stock. Baizitu assorted colors are sold at 2.3 fen, but the sales route is quite deserted. The sales of western goods such as linen yarn and pongee are still good. However, at this time of drastic decline in the shilling, those who hold goods are losing money. A batch of seven-silk raw silk was resold to the main street yesterday. Fengyu Yiben Wanli was at 5.15 taels, and Huaji goods were at 5.1 taels, it is said.</p>
<h3>Old Hardware: The Tianjin Gang Bought 3,000-4,000 Dan of Old Iron</h3>
<p>Affected by the drastic decline in the exchange rate, the cost of old iron on the market increased. The public assembly proposed raising prices. Seeing this situation, the customer gang was terrified, so they scrambled to collect them, especially the Tianjin gang, which bought the most enthusiastically, totaling 3,000-4,000 dan. The price was increased slightly. It was heard that there were more than a dozen types of goods offered, such as yangyuan touyang ban tou, white lead wire, and cut iron. As for transactions in new goods, they felt fresh and few.</p>
