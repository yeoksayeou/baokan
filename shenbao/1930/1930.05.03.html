<p>南京蔣一日發表一五一節對工會講演）文如下五月一日是工人要求八小時工作制獲得成功的一日也就是工人爲解除痛苦而奮鬭獲得勝利的一日所以五一節乃是工人運動的歷史上最値得紀念的一日世界全體的工人到了這一日都要同聲慶祝以紀念過去的勝利鼓勵將來的成功自從五一節流行到中國以來中國的工人多年到了今天也都開會慶祝以誌紀念我覺得中國工人當這個可慶祝日子應該有一種正確的認識就是要認識中國工人所處的地位及其應努力的方向中國工人現在所處的地位是怎樣簡單的説中國工人所處的地位和外國工人所處的地位不同總理在民國十三年五一節對工人友演説道　外國工人是受本國資本家壓迫不受外國資本家壓迫中國工人恰恰是相反不受本國資本家的壓迫要受外國資本家的壓迫這就是中外工人不同的情形　總理這幾句話很明白而深刻的説明中國工人所處的地位了因爲在不平等條約的束縛之下外國人不僅可以以最低的關税輸入外貨間接的阻碍中國工業的繁榮而且可以在中國内地經營工業現重能直接的壓迫中國工業的發展所以中國現在工業的勢力差不多完全操在外人手上中國自已所經營的工業不過在外國的經濟壓迫之下苟延殘喘罷了因此剥削中國工人壓迫中國工人的主要是外國資本家中國資本家和外國資本家比較起來實在是不足輕重總理説　我們本國的資本家實在没有壓迫工人的大的力實在工人所受的最大痛苦是由於外國的經濟壓迫　我們從此就可知中國工人現在所處的地位了外國資本家是剥削者是壓迫者是主人中國工人被剥削者是被壓迫者是奴隷這就是中國工人的特殊情形所以中國工人要奮鬭的對象是外國資本家如果中國工人没有看淸對象也和外國工人一樣只在國内對本國資本家鬭爭工人的痛苦絶對不是因此解除因爲即使把中國的資本家全部打倒了仍舊不能免除外國資本家的剥削仍舊不能解除外國資本家的壓迫這個理由很明顯不必多費説明那末中國工人應該恙樣奮鬭呢總理明白告訴我們道（諸君是工人是民國的一份子要抬高工人的地位便先要抬高國家地位）這便是總理指示中國工人努力的方法中國工人要求增高地位是有兩個先决的條件第一便是整個民族的獨立第二便是本國工業的發展如果整個民族還在帝國主義者的壓迫之下工人要想單獨求解放是萬萬作不到的如果本國的工業没有相當的發展工人單獨要求物質生活的改良也是萬萬作不到的所以我們第一要從增進民族地位之中求工人地位的增進離開民族利益便没有工人利益第二要從發展中國工業之中求中國工人生活的改良中國工業一日不發展中國工人的幸福便一日不能實現中國工人如果知道了這個道理就可以明白努力的方向了就是中國全體工人第一要在中國國民黨的領導之下努力於抵抗帝國主義以求中國的民族獨立第二要協助國民政府努力於工商業的發展以求國家經濟的建设這乃是中國工人惟一自救的出路至於政府方面當然是重視工人利益的如對於失業工人使之有業對於有業的工人改良其生活都是政府應負且應盡的責任換句話説保障工人的生存增進工人的利益都是政府應做的事這種責任政府還没有完全盡乃是政府非常抱歉的一件事不過工人不應該只站在工人的地位主張工人的利益應該站在國民的地位體諒國家的艱難和政府的環境現在中國受剥削受壓迫的不僅是工人工人以外的一切國民没有不受帝國主義者的剥削和壓迫的政府在這個國際經濟侵略國家經濟衰落的當中不能單獨爲工人謀充分的利益但是政府却没有一刻忘記我工人兩年以來政府時時刻刻努力於工會法工廠法以及其餘勞動法規的製訂並努力於勞動保險勞動敎育的提倡和實施只要於工人有利益的事政府無不盡力做去這是政府足以自慶且可以對我工人的中國工人運動的歷史本不甚久工人所受的訓練也不甚多因之中國工人較之外國工人實覺幼稚這乃是事實因爲中國工人比較幼稚所以容易被人欺騙和誘惑共產黨等利用工人作工具以遂其利益的野心家常乘着工人的幼稚不是以甘言巧語來欺騙便是以不可實現的幻想來誘惑中國工人在這重重誘惑和欺騙的當中如果得不到正當的指導尋不出正當的途徑不僅是不能解除壓迫而且要增加痛苦中國工人要解除痛苦只有在中國國民黨的領導之下有秩序有步骤有計劃的努力於國家經濟的建設然後纔能成功若果像過去的罷工示威徒然擾亂秩序適足增加工人痛苦而已在此訓政時期中國工友們應與政府共患難負艱钜耐苦耐勞堅忍沉着一步一步的遵照訓政大剛建設計劃做去不但工人痛苦可以解除即國民革命亦可完成這乃是在今日五一節紀念時候全國工友應該認識的（二日專電）</p>

<p>馬歇爾説明旨趣首由原提案人馬歇爾起立説明旨趣略謂今日召集特别會議重行討論增加華董問題之理由因覺日前此案之否决全由於誤解與未加深思所致現此項問題兩星期來疉經報紙及其他機關詳細討論但尙有一二點誤會之處茲欲稍加解釋外間頗有一種觀念似謂工部局對於增加華董一舉曾爲切實保證實屬逾越權限其實不然工部局不過一致表决向納税西人年會提案以期華董席數由三人增爲五人而已觀於本年一月十日工部局公報所載董事會議紀錄彰彰甚明（紀錄曾見前報茲從略）當時此項會議錄曾遞達領袖領事並經由外交途逕轉達中政府各方對此均無反對聲浪以是華人方面當然料其可得納税人贊成遂從事選舉新董五人由此可見工部局對於納税西人對於華人俱無失信之處再前述會議紀錄中明白表示華董之服務深爲外董所欽佩此輩外董皆與華董共事對於其處理艱巨工作上合作之價値當然處於最易判斷之地位上月十六日多數納税人之拒絶此案顯因費唐法官之報告猶未發表以爲在其調查未竣以前暫時不變租界現狀之爲愈不知此事曾告諸費唐法官而費氏實謂增加華董之議有益於公衆者也當時麥克那登少將亦曾鄭重聲明特納税人未加注意否則余信必不致否决之矣余知吾輩納税人中當無有不注念租界上外人之地位與其國際之性質及納税外人所荷之責任與義務者但華居民極重要之協助吾輩亦不可忽視近兩年中三華董與各外董間確有完滿之合作否則此案亦不再提出吾輩皆欲獲得華友之合作與贊助且不僅願與華人優秀份子有密切之協調並深知此種協調將可增進市民之利益（嗣述華董選舉方法茲從略）今或有以爲凡事一經决定之後再加考慮未免示人以弱其實不然苟於决定之後覺有錯誤而重加考慮並非示弱且適足以表見其眞力量耳總之吾輩所欲取得者與所願給予華人者俱不外公平交易而已諒在座諸公大多數皆覺增加華董一舉實予華人以公平交易俾其在工部局内有合理適常之代表權再有附帶聲明者日前英商商會與中國協會會議時俱贊成此案云</p>
<p>白克爾附議次白克爾起立附議馬歇爾提出之議案並演説稱余之附議此案本諸公共租界將來之行政須與吾人華友充分合作之志願余深悉一般人士對此合作問題頗有　議蓋以今日微返於一方面的也但吾人不可僅顧目前而當遠矚將來凡寓滬較久者必以滬埠之發展與治理之方法爲榮吾輩親見上海由一荒凉小鎭而蔚成巨埠更將以其進步爲榮但吾人須實事求是不可因自榮而存褊仄胸襟以危及上海將來之榮盛吾人當知租界之内寓有極多數華人其財產至巨而皆希望上海長此欣欣向榮及儘力維持目下之行政者其方法雖異而好名之心　正與吾人相同彼等絶不欲危及自已之安全或貶及其財產之價値此結實之團體漸漸關心市政不復能目爲好事而不負責任之民衆矣余意工部局華董已往之成績實可爲此負責任市民團體漸具實力之明澄今　選出之五董皆商界知名之士余望此</p>

<p>安諾德表示贊成次前任工部局總董安諾德登　演説表示贊成此案之見解</p>
<p>福島繼起演説日董福島繼起演説略謂上海租界之爲外人居留地此固無可置辯蓋此區乃中政府與各國條約所指定供外人居住俾可自由經商不受外界干涉是以租界行政屬諸外人明白規定於洋涇浜章程之内幸賴前人遠謨卓見措置有方始克吸引世界各地人民成爲一國際都市惟界内居民華人當然占絶大部份故其利益與志願亦當爲工部局所詳愼考慮及一九二六年工部局自動提議以議　三　　給華人遂脱離洋涇浜章程之精神而成立市行政上應有華人代表權之原則此種動議諒諸君亦皆謂其明智因就余　人所得經騐言之在前二年之艱險環境中設無華董有價値之勸告與合作則吾輩所遇之局勢必將更見嚴重也今日之提議亦不過應用此項原則更進一步藉以承認華董服務之優良而爲上海西人樂於應允華人公平合理要求之保證日前纳税西人年會中麥克唐納君之演辭固所欽佩惟謂通過此案無異賣去自已貽害後人未免言之過甚因外董人數仍遠過華董而外人管理市政之基礎不致搖動也日本人民雖對於華人中外平等之願望極表同情但亦不得不認租界之管理權當至華人有實在成績表示其能公平施政對於外人生命財產供給相當保護之時始可交與中國人民因租界之地位旣爲世界重要之國際都市同時又爲中國經濟生活之中心無論代價若何鉅大必須用種種方法謀地方之繼續發展與繁榮苟有傕殘其生機之企圖則有關係各國必合力以制止之雖然上海爲各國人民雜居之地其重要利益全在商務與實業夫以如許不同之民族而能和好共居在自治政府之下繁榮不息是其居民之智慧與常識必有大過人處足爲國際合作之良好模範今若於增加華董一案予以否决是乃破壞國際協調之行爲而淺見愚妄之計劃諒有識者决不如是現上海中外人民間商務甚鉅自外人觀之華人實爲其最好主顧而自華人觀之當亦如是試就商人立塲言之有所獲而後有所予因商人之常態但同時亦必善待其主顧今納税諸君果願工部局完全不效商人之所爲而觸怒華主顧乎吾知其决不然也蓋唯有互相尊敬彼此顧念而後始能造成諒解與信仟之空氣有此空氣而後商務始得以興盛倘諸君對於華友吹毛求疵固無所底止但世間人孰無過苛求何爲此日之議案乃向正確途徑向互相尊敬信任之途徑進行者也納税諸君目今上海之前途已深植於國際善意之基礎之上而其行政亦全在有關係各民族賢明之識見與判斷對於華人如此讓步絶無絲毫危險故希望諸君以絶大多數通過此案以示吾輩歡迎華人合作之至意云云</p>
<p>華德斥責麥唐納嗣律師華德登壇斥責上次麥克唐納之演説指爲危險份子略謂英國律師按照不成文法例向不准在政治集會演説麥君旣破壞此例又藉其滔滔雄辯發一炸彈將工部局炸入九天雲宵並將在塲納税人引入屠宰塲有若馴羊麥君實屬濫用辯才激動他人情感應當列入危險份子之儔據余意見凡不欲有所成就而唯圖個人之勝利者此種人最不足取云云華氏演説甚長共歷二十餘分鐘座衆因爲時已晏饑腸轆轆不耐久聽以致囂聲屢作</p>

<p>受兄嫂壓迫旋命開始辯論首由原告律師陳述略稱本案原被兩造係同父異母之兄妹原告自幼爲兄嫂撫養長成飽受兄嫂之壓迫即婚姻亦係被兄引誘而成嫁時使原告李代桃僵初允給原告若何利益及事旣成妝奩亦不置給致原告嫁一窮人嗣經理論始與原告萬元原告係其幼妹被告應仰體父母之意將遺產分給今旣不分祗得請求法院裁判云云</p>
<p>父母是否喜悦被告之律師當予答辯謂原告係於光緒年間出嫁實無分析遺產之權原告自亦知之遂改援大理院判例如爲父母所喜悦可酌分遺產但原告是否爲父母所喜悦未曾證明假定喜悦則須視財產狀况</p>
<p>婚姻一節不確查邱培山於光緖三十四年逝世時祗有遺產五萬有德昶潤之賬簿可以查考即使酌分當以此時之財產狀况爲根據况原告於十五歲時因與呂姓發生戀愛馴致私奔被告已於其時報告捕房並請律師聲明從此脱離關係今原告訴狀所述婚　一節殊不確實然被告於其嫁後仍念兄妹之情給以一萬元</p>
<p>財產係自置至於被告現在之財產狀况多係被告自置原告所請毫無理由要求駁斥並令負擔訟費云云</p>
<p>婚禮有照片原告之律師復起立辯稱被告以原告係屬私奔殊非實情蓋若爲私奔則於舉行婚禮時被告之女斷不願加入儐相之列此有照片可以證明</p>
<p>請求假扣押關於財產狀况照歷來解釋當以分析時之財產額爲標準倘繼承時之財產少而分析時之財產多其所增多者應認爲遺產所滋生當然照分析時之財產狀况判斷惟原告尙有一點須鄭重聲明爲恐被告將財產隱匿則將來執行必感困難故請求先予執行假扣押庶免被其隱匿云云</p>
<p>再予和解機會楊推事遂宣告辯論終結並再予雙方以和解機會將宣判時期延長至兩禮拜仰雙方互相讓步在外和解如期滿仍和解無成即行宣判</p>

<h3 id="c185">滬紗去甬之罷運 <a href="#c185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>罷運之原因上海棉紗一項出口甚巨其運往寗波者多由太古招商寗紹及三北等四公司之滬甬班船承載之上月下旬本埠各紗廠及棉紗字號等接得甬電謂寗波之棉鈔入口税因當地包認額由四十萬元一年今須增至一百萬元税額上須加增至十分之六對於上海裝往之棉紗因之實行加税而本埠各紗廠及紗號遂會議自五一起實行停裝棉紗赴甬致成此罷運之局也</p>
<p>事前之趕裝滬上各紗號以得訊較早乃將現有之棉紗約五六千件與四公司商定噸位在四月二十九日以前儘五天之内趕運往甬故上兩班之新江天新寗紹寗興及盛京等輪由滬開甬時均滿裝棉紗每次每輪各載千餘件不等最後一批爲新寗紹與新江天所運去者在三十日以前統已至該埠矣</p>
<p>罷運兩個月五月一日起上海已無棉紗運甬茲聞各紗號之預計連日由滬提前裝去之紗足可敷寗波各布廠號等兩個月之用途故公議在五六兩個月中滬上不准裝一件棉紗到寗波也各紗號對於增税一事實際上並無反對之表示云</p>

<p>搶米影響航業皖省本來爲產米之區安慶蕪湖等埠之米每年運來上海者甚夥而本年皖米竟無粒　裝到今則皖中以出米荒歉不敷本省之用前日安慶已發生飢民搶米之大風潮昨日滬上各輪公司接得皖電言安慶一夜中被搶之米達二千數百石現皖當局已辦平糶每石限售十元每人祗可購五升同時蕪湖亦限定每人祗可購一斗且禁止皖米出口不許裝入各輪如有滿五斗米運上輪船者便須刦去致長江輪在皖蕪兩埠並船上之自用食米亦不敢往購而他貨之運滬者亦因搶米案之影響而減　裝載來滬矣</p>
<p>建國等船復業招商局之建國輪已由漢口總部人員返京後　行開回上海昨已抵　又有停航之江新輪亦第放回來滬準明後日可以復班行駛矣尙有江裕輪一艘昨由該局電京請予釋放而寗紹公司昨亦接得蕪湖電訊謂　與輪已於昨日照常開行則已上駛赴漢矣但生意淸淡往來運費甚有不敷煤薪等項之支出者也</p>
<p>上江行船戰防漢宜一路華商輪之已經開班者近日各在客艙與司機室外加裝防彈　板據沙市來電謂該處共匪近雖略少但各鄉之農田内等仍滿插小白旗多　反動標語而仍時有　擊下下商輪之事故客家均不敢裝貨至漢口也滬上英商輪因川河領江之加薪一事即日可告解决故太古公司已令萬縣等輪在上海裝載上月停航時所積阻之大批棉紗等即日開往宜昌守待領江復職便即至渝復航川河也</p>

<p>五月節日之生尅生尅本爲術數家之説似不應移以談五月節日然事有凑巧亦言之成理正不妨强作解人一論生尅耳五月非有五一五三五四五五五九五卅諸節乎此諸節乃正相爲生尅者也有五一節之勞動運動乃遞演而於列强槍彈之下產一五卅此可謂五一生五卅亦可謂五一尅五卅也有賣國之五九節日而產生靑年救國運動之五四此五九生五四而五四乃尅五九者也有總理在廣州就任爲非常大總統之五五革命節日爲積極打倒軍閥與列强帝國主義之表示而引起强隣甚深之仇視以至公然與革命軍隊民衆尋釁而造成慘痛之五三國恥節此五五生五三亦即五五尅五三也我同胞知此生尅之理而益加振奮則恥雪有日矣</p>
<p>毒月之移交我國習俗向以五月爲毒月而當時之毒月實未足言毒今以移用於國曆之五月斯爲毒月矣廢曆之節日及俗尙之可以移用於國曆者應以毒月一名爲最切則謂毒月一名已由廢曆移交於國曆可也</p>
<p>第一個端陽節最近敎育内政兩部曾會呈行政院主張于厲行國曆後所有從前廢曆所遺之元宵端陽中秋重陽等舊節休息日除中秋改用最近秋分之望日外其餘仍按照國曆月日通行以資休息並將各項節日如元宵之迎燈端陽之競渡中秋之賞月等應時娛樂一律恢復則今年之五月五日當爲厲行國曆後第一端陽節矣憶戴季陶先生曾有端陽競渡爲體育運動之一亦値得提倡之説誠至言也蓋于總理奮鬥表示之節日實行一種體育運動乃至有意義者我謂舊時之焚蒼术白芷洒雄黃酒於門隅庭除爲除毒運動淸潔運動正亦不妨繼續舉行並將其運動延長至五月十五之法定淸潔運動節豈不更有意思乎　　楊衛玉先生演講瑣記任予</p>

<p>巴黎的電影院</p>
<p>派拉Patamount是最新建築的一個電影院它是專演美國Paramant公司的影片的它那建築的崇宏裝璜的新式大槪在巴黎也很出風頭罷但是他的門票却不很貴最便宜的十法郎所以一輩人都很歡喜去而且它是巴黎最早映有聲影片的電影院最近更添映有聲的新聞影片了我記得有一回剛從日内瓦回來在這裹看見去年國際聨盟會各要人演講的有聲影片開首是一位傴背白鬚的老翁走上台去摩拳拍桌説着一口淸晰宏亮的法語這就是法外長白里安過了許久英總理麥克唐納上台了兩隻眼精向着台下像獅子那樣耽視精神百倍的説着喉音的英語他高興的時候就張起兩隻手甚而至於跳動其次是已故的德外長斯德曼他的身體很胖他似乎很簡潔地説幾句斬釘截鐵的話甚至咬緊着牙齒台下的觀衆都鼓起掌來了其餘就不再映了我很奇怪大槪人應該自助然後才得人助必先自已有了能力然後才能愽得人家的同情我那時覺得這些都是有光榮的人我想我爲什麽不去登台手舞足蹈地放開喉管高聲講一口藍靑官話呢····然而我終於是不會和政治發生關係的</p>
<p>GaumantPalace是歐洲最大的影院可以容五千人是跑馬塲改造的建築設備雖然舊式但是極其莊麗每演一片以後終是插幾幕跳舞應用的背景和電光也極巧妙尤其是它們的樂隊是巴黎最著名的音樂家大槪在八十人以上</p>
<p>最近又有幾個新的電影院完全是適應新的藝術運動而誕生的其中最著名的是OcildePariso可譯做巴黎之目場所極小至多只能容三百人左右内面的裝璜眞新得有點徹底兩面壁上畫着未來派那樣的壁畫眞像小孩子們所描的畫純用線的表現法非常痛快自由無拘束他們畫的裸禮女神一隻腿比身體還要粗地面和週圍的背景都是依着線的勢力描着大膽的遠近法在這裹又使我聨想到中國畫的表現法他所演的片子也多是哲學的科學的還有宣傳立體派未來派的諸種新藝術的並不如普通電影院之專演迎合一般心理之愛情偵</p>
<p>探滑稽等劇</p>
<p>本來電影的價値現在一天一天的增高第一因爲他是打破時間與空間的藝術第二因爲他是最普遍的人生的娛樂第三因爲他是近代科學與近代藝術的雙生子所以現代法國文壇也時常有人討論這種問題因爲不單是要利用他宣傳某種主義或政策例如赤俄之宣傳世界革命和美國之宣傳禁酒不單是爲商人靠了他致富而且變成了哲學家科學家藝術家各種代表着文化的人物的合作的試騐室原來藝術是民衆的同時又指導民衆使人類向至高之目的而歸根於内面的自已的完成現代電影的藝術的理想就在於此罷</p>

<p>Nanjing, on the 2nd, Chiang issued a vow to the troops to suppress Yan and Feng, stating: "Yan and Feng are rebellious, seizing territory and claiming military power, undermining unification, harming the country and its people, gathering bandits to resist the revolution. Why should the Northwest suffer such calamity? Revolutionary soldiers save the country and protect the people, righteously suppressing the rebels, not shirking sacrifice. Who dares to take on the great task of unification? Only we, the soldiers, plead for the people's sake. United in affection and sincerity, with one heart and one mind, without arrogance or complacency, we will live and die together. We will die for unification, live for unification, and strive for unification. If unification is not achieved, the national crisis will persist. If the country falls and the race perishes, what joy is there in surviving? Under the gaze of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, with the victory of the Three Principles of the People, united in spirit and with common hatred for the enemy, we are invincible and unbreakable. What achievement cannot be accomplished? How can the rebel bandits not collapse? Such petty clowns will surely be annihilated, restoring unification, securing our nation, completing the revolution, and permanently preserving peace." (2nd-day special dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3 id="e8">The War of Words and the Key to the Japanese Parliament <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Although the current Japanese parliamentary debates involve many issues and the attacks on the government are fierce, the issue that the Japanese government finds most difficult to deal with is the issue of military reduction. The issue of military reduction is not inherently difficult to deal with, but it is difficult to deal with because of the discord with the Military Affairs Bureau.</p>
<p>Whether it is a country, a government, a party, or an organization, if there is an external enemy, no matter how strong, there is always a way to deal with it. However, if the division is not from the outside but from within, the difficulty of dealing with it is many times greater than dealing with an external enemy, and may even become impossible. Therefore, if there is internal inconsistency, it is impossible to take action on anything. Looking at the past political situations in Japan, they often did not collapse due to major issues in parliament but due to one or two minor issues. The reason for this is often due to internal division. In the current military reduction conference in Japan, many people within the military cliques are dissatisfied with the concessions, not only the opposition party to the government but also the military personnel within the government. Although they cannot overturn the situation due to the pressure of the general trend, their resentment is the same as that of the opposition. In terms of the Japanese political system, the power of military cliques to influence the political situation has not declined, so the Hamaguchi cabinet will ultimately find it difficult to cope with the situation.</p>

<p>Domestic Important Telegrams Three</p>
<p>May First Labor Day</p>
<h3 id="e15">Chiang's Speech to Labor Unions <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, Chiang issued a speech to labor unions on May 1st Labor Day: May 1st is the day when workers' demands for an eight-hour workday were successfully met, and also the day when workers' struggles to alleviate suffering achieved victory. Therefore, May 1st is the most memorable day in the history of the labor movement. On this day, all workers worldwide celebrate together to commemorate past victories and encourage future success. Since May 1st became popular in China, Chinese workers have also been holding meetings and celebrations on this day to commemorate the event. I believe that Chinese workers should have a correct understanding of this celebratory day, which is to understand the position of Chinese workers and the direction they should strive for. What is the current position of Chinese workers? Simply put, the position of Chinese workers is different from that of foreign workers. Premier Sun Yat-sen said in a speech to workers on May 1st in 1924: "Foreign workers are oppressed by their own domestic capitalists but not by foreign capitalists. Chinese workers are the exact opposite, not oppressed by domestic capitalists but oppressed by foreign capitalists. This is the difference between Chinese and foreign workers." Premier Sun Yat-sen's words clearly and profoundly explained the position of Chinese workers. Because under the constraints of unequal treaties, foreigners can not only import foreign goods with the lowest tariffs, indirectly hindering the prosperity of Chinese industry, but also operate industries in the Chinese mainland, directly suppressing the development of Chinese industry. Therefore, the economic power of China today is almost entirely in the hands of foreigners. Chinese-owned industries are only eking out a living under the economic oppression of foreign countries. Therefore, the main exploiters and oppressors of Chinese workers are foreign capitalists. Compared to foreign capitalists, Chinese capitalists are insignificant. Premier Sun Yat-sen said, "Our own domestic capitalists do not have great power to oppress workers. The greatest suffering workers endure is due to foreign economic oppression." From this, we can know the current position of Chinese workers. Foreign capitalists are the exploiters, the oppressors, the masters. Chinese workers are the exploited, the oppressed, the slaves. This is the special situation of Chinese workers. Therefore, the target of Chinese workers' struggles is foreign capitalists. If Chinese workers do not see the target clearly and fight against domestic capitalists in the same way as foreign workers, the suffering of workers will absolutely not be alleviated. Even if all the Chinese capitalists are overthrown, it will still not eliminate the exploitation of foreign capitalists, nor will it eliminate the oppression of foreign capitalists. This reason is very obvious and does not need much explanation. Then, how should Chinese workers struggle? Premier Sun Yat-sen clearly told us (you are workers, members of the Republic of China, to raise the status of workers, you must first raise the status of the country). This is the method that Premier Sun Yat-sen instructed Chinese workers to strive for. There are two prerequisites for Chinese workers to demand an increase in status: first, the independence of the entire nation; second, the development of domestic industry. If the entire nation is still under the oppression of imperialists, workers cannot achieve liberation alone. If domestic industry does not have considerable development, workers cannot improve their material lives alone. Therefore, we must first seek the improvement of workers' status from the increase of national status. Without national interests, there are no workers' interests. Second, we must seek the improvement of Chinese workers' lives from the development of Chinese industry. If Chinese industry does not develop, the happiness of Chinese workers will not be realized. If Chinese workers understand this principle, they can understand the direction of their efforts, that is, all Chinese workers must first, under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, strive to resist imperialism in order to achieve China's national independence; second, assist the National Government in striving for the development of industry and commerce in order to achieve national economic construction. This is the only way out for Chinese workers to save themselves. As for the government, of course, it attaches importance to the interests of workers. For example, providing employment for unemployed workers and improving the lives of employed workers are the responsibilities that the government should bear and fulfill. In other words, ensuring the survival of workers and increasing the interests of workers are all things that the government should do. The government has not yet fully fulfilled this responsibility, which is something the government is very sorry about. However, workers should not only stand in the position of workers and advocate for the interests of workers, but should stand in the position of the people and understand the difficulties of the country and the environment of the government. Now, those who are exploited and oppressed in China are not only workers. All the people other than workers are also exploited and oppressed by imperialists. In this international economic aggression and national economic decline, the government cannot solely seek full benefits for workers. However, the government has never forgotten our workers in the past two years. The government has been working hard on the formulation of the Trade Union Law, the Factory Law, and other labor laws and regulations, and has been striving for the promotion and implementation of labor insurance and labor education. As long as it benefits workers, the government will do its best. This is something the government can be proud of and can say to our workers. The history of the Chinese labor movement is not very long, and the training that workers have received is not very much. Therefore, Chinese workers are indeed more immature than foreign workers. This is a fact. Because Chinese workers are relatively immature, they are easily deceived and seduced. Communists and other ambitious people who use workers as tools to achieve their interests often take advantage of the immaturity of workers, either deceiving them with sweet words and tricks or seducing them with unrealizable fantasies. If Chinese workers cannot get proper guidance and find a proper path in this repeated temptation and deception, they will not only fail to eliminate oppression but also increase suffering. Chinese workers can only eliminate suffering by working under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, in an orderly, step-by-step, and planned manner, for the construction of the national economy, and then they can succeed. If they engage in strikes and demonstrations as in the past, it will only disrupt order and increase the suffering of workers. During this period of political tutelage, Chinese workers should share the difficulties of the government, bear hardships, endure hard work, persevere, remain calm, and follow the construction plan step by step. Not only can the suffering of workers be eliminated, but the national revolution can also be completed. This is what all workers in the country should recognize on the occasion of the May 1st Labor Day commemoration. (2nd-day special telegram)</p>

<p>Workers' Movements are Lively in Various Countries</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 1st: Today, major cities across the United States commemorate Labor Day with public gatherings and speeches everywhere. Although minor clashes are unavoidable and occur from time to time, they have not escalated into major tragedies. Initially, the situation in New York was particularly serious due to the conflict between veterans of overseas wars and communist personnel. Both sides scheduled a rally in Union Square today, with the leaders holding great animosity towards each other. Fortunately, the military police took strict precautions in advance and warned both sides not to overstep their boundaries. As a result, although both sides gathered at the same location today, order was maintained. Only a group of radicals attacked capitalists once. Minor clashes occurred in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Oakland, where military police and rioters engaged in brawls, but there were no major injuries or deaths. Workers across the country unanimously condemned the New York Fascist Party's policy of inciting the public on International Labor Day. Communist personnel recently issued a declaration calling on the working class to pass a resolution condemning the Wall Street policy announced by the New York Police Department (Wall Street representing the capitalist class) and advising workers to organize their own worker defense teams for free parades, gatherings, and speeches.</p>

The Metropolitan Police Department ordered over 6,000 police officers under its command to be on full alert. In view of the failure of the streetcar strike, the left-wing groups, seeing the situation, planned to strike again. An order was issued to each branch yesterday afternoon. The streetcar authorities are also preparing to implement a ticket exchange method in case of a strike and are currently preparing for it.</p>

After several speeches, they split into two teams, each marching to the locations where the most violent clashes with the police occurred last year. They paid respects to the small [memorials] decorated with flags and wreaths and to party leader Selman before dispersing. At the same time, 100,000 Social Democrats also gathered in the same square, but only played sacred music and gave speeches without marching. Reports from across the country also claimed peace and tranquility without any disturbances.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Brussels, 1st: During a communist parade in Liege, Belgium, an attempt was made to break into the local prison to release political prisoners.

The most severe disturbances occurred in Saint-Denis, where even the mayor and city council members were among those arrested.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 1st: Today, 223 May Day strike picketers were arrested and revolutionary leaflets were dispersed, but the situation has been calm until this evening.

<p>Preliminary Hearing for Lahore Assassination Case Halted</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, London, 1st: The British government decided at its cabinet meeting on the 30th to actively suppress the non-violent resistance movement in India. In view of the significant impact of Gandhi's words and actions, the situation in various places is gradually becoming serious. It has been decided that Gandhi will be arrested, with the timing of the arrest left to the Indian authorities.</p>
<p>Reuters, Surat, 2nd: Gandhi spoke in Rand yesterday, asking Muslims to join the movement against the salt law and alcohol consumption and to participate in promoting local cotton spinning.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 30th: Correspondence between the Indian Governor-General, Lord Irwin, and the Muslim leader, Muhammad Ali, has now been released. Ali's letter advised the Governor-General not to arrest Gandhi to avoid further worsening the situation and stated that the Indian government has sufficiently demonstrated its power and hopes that the government and Gandhi will not focus solely on prestige but change their approach to establishing peace and freedom. The Governor-General's secretary replied, acknowledging the good intentions in Ali's letter, but pointed out that some Indian leaders are not accepting the friendly proposal of the government to organize a Round Table Conference, rejecting a reasonable path and adopting destructive methods. The Indian government's desire for reconciliation still exists, but if anyone deliberately violates the law, the government will have to curb them. Reuters, Simla, 1st: Indian Governor-General Irwin issued another decree today, halting the preliminary investigation of the Lahore assassination case. This case is related to the murder of the senior superintendent of police in Lahore in December 1928. The trial has been delayed for nine months due to the defendant's hunger strike and the revolutionary movement. The Indian Governor-General has now authorized the Chief Justice of the High Court to organize a special court consisting of three judges to hear this type of case in order to quickly conclude the case and maintain general respect for the law. Reuters, Calcutta, 1st: Indian journalists in Bengal held a meeting and decided to temporarily suspend publication of newspapers until the news laws are repealed and decided to hold an All-India Newspaper Conference in Allahabad in mid-May to decide future policies.</p>

<p>Opposition Parties Raise Various Questions</p>
<p>The Difficulties Ahead Lie in the Upper House</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: The second day of the House of Representatives' budget general meeting was held on the 1st. First, the government submitted three proposals: (No. 2) General Account Revenue and Expenditure Budget Supplementary Bill for the 5th year of Showa; (Special No. 2) Special Account Revenue and Expenditure Budget Supplementary Bill for the 5th year of Showa; and (No. 3) General Account Revenue and Expenditure Budget Supplementary Bill for the 5th year of Showa. Finance Minister Inoue explained the reasons for the proposals. Then, Uehara Etsujiro of the Seiyukai Party took the floor, stating that Foreign Minister Shidehara had said that it was the freedom of the United States to exercise its right to begin building three large cruisers by 1936, which was unclear. Discussing national defense on such an unstable foundation can be said to be extremely imprudent. Then, there was a Q&amp;A session with the Foreign Minister regarding the current strength. The Foreign Minister replied that the issue of current strength concerns battleships, not auxiliary ships. This conference was initially conducted by various countries in a spirit of mutual concession and compromise. Uehara asked if this was a humiliating excuse for diplomacy. The Foreign Minister replied that Uehara's argument was that he wanted to conduct diplomacy through force, which is an outdated form of diplomacy that does not fit the times. Uehara asked if he considered Britain's reservation of the right to build three large cruisers a threat to world peace. The Foreign Minister replied that this was not within the scope of the response. Uehara then turned his criticism towards the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister replied that national defense is relative. Japan's national defense is more than sufficient for defense but not enough for offense. However, we have fully exchanged opinions with the military department regarding having sufficient armaments. Therefore, national defense is absolutely safe. As for the specific reasons, they are military secrets and cannot be revealed. At that time, Chairman Morita warned Uehara for his lengthy questions, causing a great uproar from the Seiyukai Party. Uehara then discussed the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement, asking whether the agreement included a reciprocal treaty and whether Japan's humiliating haste to conclude the agreement had stained diplomatic history. The Foreign Minister replied that the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement has not been formally signed, and its contents cannot be revealed. Critics are free to criticize. After further Q&amp;A, the meeting recessed at noon and continued in the afternoon. Questions were raised by Ohkuchi Kiichi, Homin Nishiomiharu and others from the Seiyukai at the general budget meeting until late into the night before dismissing the meeting.</p>
<p>Electric Communication Agency, Tokyo, 2nd: The situation in the House of Representatives is such that the questioning on the main issues has been completed in the plenary sessions of the past few days, but there remains interest in the budget committee and other committees. However, there is a sense of having overcome the difficulties. The difficulties ahead lie in the Upper House. How the government will overcome the various difficulties in the Upper House regarding command authority, compulsory education budget increases, etc., is highly noteworthy. The government convened a cabinet meeting last night to discuss its strategy for the Upper House. Regarding the issue of command authority, it was decided to maintain the initial stance throughout, still answering that it could not respond to in-depth questions and being cautious not to cause loopholes. However, today's Tokyo Asahi Shimbun was quite angry about the government's attitude, stating that the rift between the government and the military command is becoming an open secret, and that the government is trying to cover up the immediate situation with evasive answers, deceiving itself or deceiving others.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Received Naval Convention <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>White House Holds Ceremony for Delivering the Convention</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 30th - Mr. Stimson, in his capacity as the leader of the delegation to the London Naval Conference, today presented the London-concluded convention to President Hoover at the White House. The White House lawn was filled with photographers vying to capture the moment of the delivery. Key figures present at the ceremony included Secretary of the Navy Adams, Senator Roblin, and representatives from both the State Department and the Navy Department. The greetings and responses between the host and guests were all recorded by photographers using special audio and motion picture cameras. After the ceremony, Senator Roblin went to the Senate to receive the congratulations of all the senators and express his gratitude for their hard work at the Naval Conference. Roblin stated that, according to this convention, the United States can complete its original naval construction plan ahead of schedule. It is estimated that this will cost the United States $100 million annually. Although the cost is significant, if the United States does not want to abandon its position as a naval power, it should build ships to the maximum extent allowed by the limitations. It is reported that the convention may be submitted to the Senate for approval tomorrow, but the timing of its passage may still take some time because three senators have requested to thoroughly examine the convention, and debates in the Senate regarding the convention may also take considerable time.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 1st - When the London Naval Conference agreement began consideration in the Senate committee today, Senator Hale was the first to stand up and speak, saying that he could not support this agreement and wished the committee to question each of the representatives who went to London in detail. It is reported that the first person to express his views before the committee will be Secretary of the Navy Adams.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 30th - The director of the Liberal Party headquarters, Moore, published an article in the Glasgow Evening News today denying that the Liberal Party had concluded an alliance with the Labour Party. However, he said that when free trade is about to be destroyed, the relationship between the two parties will naturally become closer. The Liberal Party will always support the government, regardless of which party it is composed of. However, if the administration goes against the principles of the Liberal Party, the Liberal Party will abandon it. Consul stationed in Australia</p>

<p>Reuters, Sydney, 1st - The Chinese Consul-General in Sydney, Australia, sent a letter to the Australian Federal Government requesting that the practice of requiring Chinese immigrants to be fingerprinted be stopped. He stated that the Chinese people are requesting the Chinese government to treat immigrants from Australia to China in the same way, so this practice is making it difficult for the Chinese government. The Chinese Consul-General also stated that the method of searching Chinese immigrants is not applied to people of other countries. This discriminatory treatment should be restricted. Even if a small number of Chinese immigrants enter Australia without permission, it seems appropriate to be lenient. The Chinese Consulate will implement strict registration methods. The prohibition of wives and children of Chinese immigrants from entering the country is harmful to morality and ethics, and it seems appropriate to change the procedure. If Chinese immigrants leave Australia when they are old, the quota they leave behind can be filled by young relatives.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Important News Before Mo Dehui's Departure <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Conference Procedure is Generally Decided</p>
<p>The Budget is Estimated at 210,000</p>
<p>Mr. Mo Expressed at the Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>Harbin News - Mo Dehui, the Plenipotentiary Representative for the Sino-Russian Conference, is scheduled to depart from Harbin at 10:30 AM on May 1st, along with his entourage and Russian personnel from the Chinese Eastern Railway heading to Moscow to participate in the conference. It is expected that they will arrive in Moscow at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. It is reported that the Chinese Eastern Railway has prepared a special train consisting of four flower cars, two first-class cars, one second-class car, and baggage cars, etc., which will go directly to Moscow. The procedure for the conference is that all cases will first be discussed separately by the specialized committees of the Chinese and Russian sides, then submitted to the joint meetings of the specialized committees of the Chinese and Russian sides, and then submitted to the general conference for resolution. After Mr. Mo goes to Russia, the affairs of the Directorate of the Chinese Eastern Railway will be handled on his behalf by Counselor Jin Ronggui, and the affairs of the Board of Directors will be handled on his behalf by Deputy Chairman Li Shaogeng. The central government has agreed to allocate 70,000 yuan per month for the conference expenses, totaling 210,000 yuan for three months. 100,000 yuan has already been remitted to Liaoning and forwarded for application.</p>
<p>Representative Mo Dehui was scheduled to depart for the Russian conference. Director Zhang Xuwu and various agencies specially hosted a banquet at the Director's Office at 8:00 PM last night, the 25th, to bid farewell to Mr. Mo. After Mr. Zhang delivered a farewell speech on behalf of everyone, Mr. Mo replied, saying that he was deeply grateful for the banquet hosted by Director Zhang and the leaders of various military and political agencies. He had been ordered to go to Russia for two months, and he had repeatedly declined due to the great responsibility, so he had been delayed. Recently, the central and local officials had been urging him, and the legal organizations and the public of various provinces had been sending telegrams to urge him. In addition, every citizen is responsible for national affairs, so he had to take on the difficult task. Therefore, he resolutely decided to leave on May 1st and would not delay. However, this mission is not comparable to ordinary negotiations. If he can fulfill his mission without disgrace, it will not only solve the disputes of the East Road in the past few years, but also consolidate the peace of East Asia. Since the responsibility is so great, he asks himself that his talents are weak and he is afraid that he will not be able to do it. He can only hold the word "loyalty" and use the spirit of equality and harmony to mediate the conflicts. He still hopes that the Director and everyone will give instructions and special assistance from time to time, so that the conference can be successfully resolved. This is not only the luck of the country, but also the common hope of the people of the two countries. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Military Situation on the Western Front <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence - The military situation between Xuzhou and Henan has been quiet for a long time, but recently it has gradually become active. According to information gathered here, after Feng Yuxiang took responsibility for the military affairs of the Longhai Line, he recently held a meeting with various generals in Luoyang to make every effort to contact them. It was also decided to hold a meeting in Zhengzhou on May 1st, and generals from Shanxi and the Northwest will attend. Feng's plan initially focused on the development of the Longhai Line, and he has ordered Sun Chu's troops of the Shanxi Army to take the middle route, with Wan Xuancai's troops as the vanguard. Shi Yousan's troops, originally north of the Longhai Line, will take the left wing, and Sun Dianying's troops, originally south of the Longhai Line, will take the right wing. Currently, Sun Chu's troops are still waiting to depart, and Wan Xuancai's troops are temporarily taking the middle route. A portion of Wan's troops has indeed advanced from Kaifeng to Guide, and two armored trains of unknown name have also been driven from Zhengzhou to the Guide railway station to await orders to advance as a preparation for attack. Shi's troops wanted to cross the river directly eastward from Daokou, but because the water was deep and difficult to cross, they turned south to the Shengdao Changyuan Fengqiu to reach Kaocheng and then to Dongming, showing signs of advancing towards western Shandong. Sun's troops, originally stationed in Guide, Haozhou, Zhecheng, and Luyi, have also been moving in large numbers to the vicinity of Haozhou in northern Anhui as a preparation for advancing towards northern Anhui. The deployment of the enemy's Chen Line is roughly like this, and there is also news that they will launch an attack on the 3rd after the Zheng order arrives. At present, the central army is very calm in dealing with this situation, but for reconnaissance of enemy information and sabotage prevention, a certain team of aircraft stationed in Xuzhou has been dispatched westward to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Guide, Dongming, Haozhou, etc. It is heard that the enemy has very few aircraft. A small number of aircraft from Shanxi are still in Shijiazhuang, and Feng's aircraft are also on the Luoyang route. Both the route and the combat power are very weak. Also, according to military circles here, it is said that Feng is using the Shanxi army and miscellaneous troops to deal with the Longhai Line and will draw the Northwest Army along the Pinghan Line. Hubei is where Feng's main troops are still gathered between Henan and Luoyang. In fact, the central army has already made preparations. The current situation in Xuzhou is still stable and the traffic on the Tianjin-Longhai Line is still as usual. Therefore, the rumors that the western front has already seen fighting are still premature. However, the situation on the western front is expected to have new developments in early next month.

<h3 id="e94">Measures Decided for Relieving the Siege of Zhucheng <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - The Gao Guizi troops in Zhucheng and Juxian have been calling for help from various representatives. As a result, Gao's troops were transferred to Taian. Ma Hongkui came to Jinan for the second time to discuss with Chen Tiaoyuan, who agreed to take full responsibility to ensure that Gao's troops would not cause any further changes. In addition, a brigade from Ma's troops will first go to Zhucheng to monitor Gao's troops to prevent any mishaps. Chen Tiaoyuan believes that this method will ensure both the prestige of the central government and the security of the local area, so he immediately agreed. Gao Guizi also telegraphed his approval. Ma then returned to Taian to prepare to send troops to Zhucheng to take over the defense. Han Shuzhi, Gao Guizi's representative, first went to Zhucheng with Ma Hongkui's representative to inform Gao's army to avoid any misunderstandings. After Ma's troops arrived, Chen Zhongfu's brigade immediately withdrew on the 30th. In total, Zhucheng was besieged on February 20th, and April 30th was a total of two months and ten days. The people in the city suffered great losses, and the survivors of the war are in a pitiful situation. It is also heard that after Gao's troops are under Ma Hongkui, the central government will still give Gao the position of commander of the newly编19th Division, and Chen Yaohan's troops surrounding Juxian can also be withdrawn at the same time. However, Ma Hongkui's troops have not yet sent troops to Juxian. (April 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e95">Mongolian Banner Representatives Have All Arrived in Shenyang <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>However, the representatives have inconsistent opinions internally.</p>
<p>Representatives from the Western Three Leagues and other places have already turned back.</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence - Five or sixty representatives from the three leagues of Jerim, Juu Uda, and Josutu, as well as various Mongolian banners from Hulunbuir, have all arrived in Shenyang, waiting for the representatives of the Jilin Provincial Government to arrive before going to Nanjing together for the Mongolian and Tibetan Conference. Commander-in-Chief Zhang will host a banquet in the coming days and collect the proposed proposals from various parties for preliminary review. It is heard that the representatives from the Josutu League (i.e., the Kharachin and other banners) mostly advocate Mongolian autonomy, implicitly intending to abolish the princes, while also excluding the Han people. The representatives from the Jerim League (i.e., the Khorchin and other banners) mostly advocate maintaining the special rights of the princes, and although they are also unwilling to open up Mongolian wasteland again, they do not dare to openly exclude the Han people. If the conference is indeed held, there will inevitably be a fierce dispute between the two factions. It is expected that the outcome of the resolution will inevitably disappoint one party and provoke ill feelings. It is feared that Inner Mongolia will be more troubled from now on. The Mongolians are foolish and suspicious, and although they are not to be feared, they often use the threat of leaning towards Outer Mongolia to intimidate them, which is also difficult to deal with.</p>
<p>Those who are scheduled to participate in this conference are from ten regions, namely the Eastern Three Leagues, the Western Three Leagues, Hulunbuir, Ejina, Torghut, Qinghai, and other banners. It was originally scheduled to meet in Beiping and go south together. However, after the representatives from the Eastern Three Leagues and Hulunbuir arrived in Liaoning, the representatives from the Western Three Leagues and other places who arrived in Beiping were blocked and sent back by the Shanxi side. Of the ten regions, only four can arrive, which is less than half. (April 28th)</p>
<h3 id="e96">Beijing Workers Celebrate Labor Day <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>A Grand Meeting Was Held at the General Labor Union</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 1st) was the International Labor Day memorial. The Beijing Municipal Workers' Organization Guidance Committee prepared in advance to hold a memorial meeting. The venue was located in the auditorium of the Municipal Workers' Guidance Committee in Caodu Lane. Starting at 9:00 AM, representatives from the Central Party Department, the National Government, various ministries and councils, the General Headquarters, the General Political Training Department, the Capital Police Department, the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Party Department members Shi Weihuan, Huang Zhongxiang, Lai Lian, representatives from the civil mass organizations Wu Xingbo, Lin Qinglong, Dan Xizhang, union cadre from various industries Chen Pingzhi, Jia Guomin, etc., and representatives from various groups totaled more than 300 people. At 9:20 AM, the meeting was announced to be in session. Chairman Wang Zuoyan performed the ceremony. Next, the chairman delivered the opening speech, roughly saying that May 1, 1886, was a memorial day for American laborers who jointly held a large demonstration against the capitalists who oppressed them, demanding eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of rest. They finally achieved victory. In 1889, French workers resolved to make May 1st the memorial day for workers of all countries because they wanted to commemorate the struggles and efforts of the advanced workers and to encourage the later generations to continue to move forward. Therefore, we must understand that the situation in China is different from that in Europe and the United States. They have gone through the industrial revolution, the means of production are concentrated, and the capital is concentrated. Their oppressors are their own countrymen who hold the economic power of the whole country. China still preserves the handicraft industry of hundreds of years ago, and trade and economic power are completely controlled by foreign capitalists, that is, controlled by imperialists of various colors. Therefore, when we commemorate May Day, we must understand that the situation in China is different from that in Europe and the United States. We cannot completely use the same means that they use to commemorate May Day. The only meaning of our commemoration of May Day is to focus on four points: (1) Reviewing the power of workers; (2) Arousing workers' awareness; (3) Revitalizing China's industry; (4) Completing the national revolution. Only in this way can we achieve the true liberation of our workers and obtain practical benefits. Subsequently, the Central Party Department representative Shi Weihuan, Municipal Party Department representative Propaganda Minister Lai Lian, and Ministry of Industry and Commerce representative Wang Guanghui gave speeches. At 12:00, the meeting adjourned with shouting slogans.</p>

<p>Songjiang Correspondence - Since the county government learned of the looting of Sijing Town, they specially dispatched Trial Officer Du, County Police Team Director Zhang Qian Shou, and Clerk Peng Min to Sijing on the 29th by Litong steamboat to inspect. According to reports from villagers at 5:00 PM yesterday, bandits from Dongjing broke into Qingpu County and were captured by local residents at Fangjia.

About a quarter of an hour after they left the town at 6:30 PM, sixteen more bandits came with banknotes in hand. One of the bandits said that someone who can point us to the remains of Third Master Zhu will be heavily rewarded. The villagers did not dare to tell them. In the end, they offered 500 yuan to find them, but no one responded. They left in frustration. Later, the townspeople found it and buried it.</p>

<p>Bandit Robbery: On the 27th night of this month, at midnight, six bandits suddenly came to the home of He Jinchang in Hejia Weir, east of Bangqiao, and robbed over four hundred silver dollars worth of clothing and jewelry. The eldest daughter-in-law of the victim was cut by a bandit's knife and severely injured. The bandits passed through Xiaohong and again robbed the Shengdai Daliang family of over two hundred silver dollars worth of jewelry and silver dollars. The Bangzhen Security Corps heard about it and gave chase, but the bandits fled east.</p>
<p>Frightened to Death by a Warrant and Corpse Abandoned in the County: Zhu Zhou, a merchant in Chonggu Town, was usually extremely frugal. This time, he was robbed by bandits. Zhu had already avoided them, but the bandits returned and forcibly kidnapped him. However, due to his old age and illness, he was unable to walk after being suddenly frightened. The bandits carried him onto a boat. His family was preparing to listen for news and prepare money for his ransom. The next day, a corpse was discovered by the riverbank about a li from the town. A passerby recognized it as Zhu and reported it to his family, who retrieved the body for burial.</p>

<p>Resisting Arrest, Criminal Apprehended and Interrogated: Qian Xiaomao of Wangmiao in this county has always been fierce and gathered people to gamble and collect commissions. He was previously arrested by the Fourth Sub-Station of the Public Security Bureau in that area but escaped. Later, he moved elsewhere to gather people for gambling. He was again arrested by the Sixth District Security Corps in that area. Qian led the crowd, wielding weapons to resist arrest, injuring several members of the Security Corps before escaping. The incident was reported to the county government by Chief Qian of the district office. County Magistrate Chen ordered a strict investigation. Recently, Qian, thinking that the matter had passed for many days, secretly returned. Zhu Liang, a patrol officer at the Public Security Sub-Station, learned of this and led police to Luojia Bridge, where he apprehended the criminal and sent him to the Second Section of the County Public Security Bureau. During interrogation, the criminal confessed that he had tried to dissuade others at the scene when the Security Corps members were beaten and did not participate in the assault. The rest of his confession was evasive. He will be transferred to the county government for judicial interrogation as the main offender in resisting arrest.</p>
<p>Huangdu Repels a Large Group of Local Bandits: In view of the rampant banditry in various places, the town organized a joint police and political affairs office, recommending Deng Jinglie, the second squad leader of the Jiading County Police stationed in the town, as the commander-in-chief, who maintained strict vigilance day and night. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 29th), early in the morning, bandits sent scouts to the town intending to loot. This was discovered by the Security Corps scouts, who immediately reported to the headquarters. The police team, together with the Security Corps, went to encircle and suppress them. After a fierce battle of half an hour, the bandits, seeing the situation was not good, fled in disarray.

<p>Ye Xie, Maojing Pond Kidnapping Case: Maojing Pond, about three li northwest of Ye Xie Town in this county, is the port of the Pujiang River. There is usually a patrol boat stationed there to protect the area. One day at about 5:00 p.m., two boats sailed over and docked near the patrol boat. The boat carried more than thirty bandits. They tied up the captain and the salt police of the patrol boat. They behaved quietly, cooking rice and smoking, so the people on the shore knew nothing. At dusk, they went straight into the Chen family's house and tied up Chen Yutang's wife, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter-in-law. Chen Xiaoxiang was shocked and ran out to report to the patrol boat. The bandit boat, pretending to be salt police, tricked Chen Xiaoxiang, his father, and Wang Xiaodi to get off the boat and tied them up as well. The Chen family then realized they had been fooled. A clothing craftsman who looked after the Chen family was also kidnapped, making a total of seven people kidnapped. The bandits claimed to be from the Taihu Gang and fired two shots as they left.</p>

Ni, the detective chief of the Second Riverine Police District, has now apprehended a major criminal in this case, Zhou Lanzhai, in Shanghai. After Zhou was escorted to Wuxi, he was transferred to the county government by the district office for interrogation. Zhou Cheng, the investigator, opened a court session last night for questioning. Zhou Lanzhai confessed that he was 39 years old and a native of Yangming Township. He used to be a foreign goods dealer, but has been unemployed for three months. On March 13, he attended Zhang Zhanhua's funeral and Qian Fenghao told Qian that he had received three letters from the kidnappers, entrusting me to make contact. Because the loan repayment was very urgent, I embezzled 100 yuan, falsely claiming it was stolen. I spent a total of 130 yuan. However, after I arrived in Shanghai, I did live in the Far East Hotel under the name of Sun Qixian. The kidnappers did not come and did not report. The rest of the confession was evasive. After questioning, Investigator Zhou Cheng ordered him to be imprisoned with shackles. Because Zhou Lanzhai's confession was unclear and he could not provide accurate information, in order to find out the truth of the case, it was decided to summon Qian Fenghao, the victim, on the 5th of this month for cross-examination to serve as verification.</p>

<p>To Ban Irresponsible Honorary Principals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau submitted a document to the Ministry of Education yesterday, saying that it was submitting a proposal to cancel the position of honorary principal because it is often unnecessary and leads to deception. It is said that the establishment of a school requires sufficient funds and perfect equipment, but the people who run it are even more important. If there is only a material foundation and the right people are not found to run it, the school will be difficult to advance. Some private schools in this city hire people from society, famous figures of the time, to serve as honorary principals. Their names are on all school documents and forms, but they never consult on various school affairs. Honorary principals are enthusiastic about education and do not hesitate to lend their names to show their support. However, those in charge of school affairs often use their reputation to gain social trust. Therefore, when disputes occur in the school, there is often no one to take responsibility, and the students are directly harmed. Therefore, we welcome those who are enthusiastic about running schools and personally manage or support them, but we propose to cancel the honorary principal system for those who do not ask about school affairs or take responsibility, so as to prevent young people from being deceived and prevent a few school administrators from using names to solicit business. The system is mainly used in schools above the junior college level, and we propose to cancel it. Is it feasible? We hereby submit this proposal for your review and instructions. Sincerely, Jiang, Minister of Education (Education Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e113">Shanghai University Plans to Set Up a Night University <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai University, is enthusiastic about vocational education. Because there are already several business colleges in Shanghai, most young people in the business community still lack institutions for higher commercial tutoring education. Therefore, it is planned to expand the School of Commerce of Shanghai University slightly and establish a branch in the commercial center of Shanghai. Because all sectors of society have requested the establishment of a night university, it has been carefully considered and tentatively named the Night School of Commerce. The draft plan is as follows: (1) The curriculum will be at the university level, accepting both men and women, and will be attached to a preparatory course for those with slightly lower levels to take remedial classes at their leisure. In addition to formal business courses, various specialized courses may be offered at any time according to special needs, and research work will be promoted to promote the development of commerce in our country. (2) Class hours: The class time will be used during the spare time of all sectors of society. The clock hours should be set after 5:00 p.m. Each course should be completed without limit to the academic year. (3) Professors: All professors are planned to be hired by business experts in the port and university graduates at home and abroad with commercial knowledge. (4) School site: The China Baptist Bookstore is currently building a seven-story building on Yuanmingyuan Road. The location is convenient for transportation. The auditorium, library, and newspaper reading room are all ready. In the future, when it is completed, one of these floors will be used by the school to open the Night School of Commerce. (5) Funding: Because the school building belongs to the Baptist Bookstore, it provides special assistance to the school's development. It only needs to bear the construction costs of one floor, so the required funds are not too large. Including start-up costs, it is about 50,000 yuan. The recurring costs will be reviewed and planned separately.</p>

Athletes from the three major cities of Kobe, Nishikyo, and Osaka gathered. The results of the women's track and field competition were the best. Nakanishi Niang's 80-meter hurdle score was 13.4 seconds. Hitomi Kinue, who is famous all over the world, scored 13.6 seconds. This time, Nakanishi Niang broke the record and created a new world record. Nakanishi Niang's 100-meter score is also amazing. Sun Guiyun's score in the National Games is 13.8 seconds. Nakanishi Niang's score is 13.2 seconds. In the future, Miss Sun may not be able to beat Nakanishi Niang in this year's competition. Our country is in grave danger. Nakanishi Niang is currently studying at Nishikyo Prefectural Nijo Girls' High School, is 19 years old, has a great and fat body, and is best at throwing the shot put, discus, and sprinting. In this Osaka competition, the lady won four firsts in a row, namely the hurdles, 100 meters, 200 meters, and 400 meters relay. As for the shot put and discus, the lady could not participate due to schedule conflicts, which is a pity, otherwise she could have won six firsts. This kind of talent is not only outstanding in East Asia, but also rare in the world. Female athletes in our country should pay attention to catching up.</p>

<p>Women's Basketball Still Uses Women's Rules</p>
<p>For the upcoming Far Eastern Games women's basketball event, Japan had previously notified the Chinese and Philippine teams that men's rules would be used. Therefore, our country initially decided not to participate. However, we recently received a telegram from the Japanese Sports Association stating that if women's basketball is included, women's rules will be used. It is heard that our country is now considering sending a team, but the selection of representatives is proving difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Zhang Xueliang Encourages Northeastern Athletes <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>More than ten athletes from the Northeast are participating in this Far Eastern Games. Commander Zhang Xueliang of the Northeast specifically telegraphed Secretary Shen, who is staying in Shanghai, to greatly encourage the athletes. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To Brother Shen Nengyi and forwarded to Liu Changchun, Zhang Lingjia, Zhao Dexin, Jiang Yunlong, Xiao Dinghua, Lang Da Kui, Liang Dexin, Fu Baorui, Shi Xinglong, Sun Guiyun, Wu Meixian, Liu Jingzhen, and Fu Baolu: The Far Eastern Games are about to open, and you are embarking on a distant expedition. The glory of the entire nation rests on you, not just a corner of the Northeast. At this time, you must strive to practice and not be idle. The results of Liu and Zhang in the recent National Games were far below their usual performance, perhaps due to acclimatization. However, the customs in Shanghai are decadent and easily lead to idleness. There will be even more temptations after arriving in Japan. I sincerely hope you will not be complacent with a little achievement, nor fall into depravity with superficial things. Strive tirelessly to achieve ultimate success. I am sending each of you 250 silver dollars to help with travel expenses. I hope you will accept it. Zhang Xueliang (Stamped)</p>

<p>Jiangzhe Middle School Tennis Tournament</p>
<h3 id="e143">Soochow Wins the Championship <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Result: 3 to 2</p>
<p>The result of the Jiangzhe Middle School tennis tournament semifinals saw Soochow University and Shanghai University competing for the final. Initial indications were that Shanghai University was likely to win the championship, but the result was that Soochow University won by a score of 3 to 2 and the championship was awarded to Soochow. The detailed account of the competition is as follows:</p>
<p>In the three singles matches, Shanghai University's Yu Tianguang, representing China's athletes, played against Mao Kanghou, who was representing Jiangsu's athletes at the National Tennis Tournament. Right from the start, the serves were vigorous and impressive. Initially, Mao was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Back and forth exchanges were not easy. Every time he would strike from the east to attack from the west, rendering the opponent unable to prepare. He won the first set 6-0. Only in the second set did Mao attempt to recover the lost lead, but he was again exploited, resulting in a 6-4 loss to end the match. Shanghai University's second and third players were ordinary, and they both lost to Soochow University's strong players Zhang Siyang and Guo Yujie. The results and groupings are as follows: (First Group) Shanghai University Yu Tianguang vs. Soochow University Mao Kanghou Result: 2-0, Shanghai University wins. Scores were 6-0, 6-4. Referee: Feng Jiaozhun (Second Group) Shanghai University He Yingsheng vs. Soochow University Zhang Siyang Result: 0-2, Soochow University wins. Scores were 3-6, 2-6. Referee: Wu Bingjian (Third Group) Shanghai University Xu Zengrui vs. Soochow University Guo Yujie Result: 0-2, Soochow University wins. Scores were 4-6, 1-6. Referee: Bai Benli</p>
<p>In the two doubles matches, after losing two of the first three singles matches, Shanghai University fully intended to win both doubles matches and take the championship back. However, Shanghai University suffered because the talent was not evenly distributed. Only Yu Tianguang held up the entire situation. It's difficult to build a forest with just one tree, so although the first group steadily gained an advantage, the second group was defeated by Soochow University, and the championship went to Soochow University. First Group: Shanghai University Yu Tianguang, He Shengying vs. Soochow University Mao Kanghou, Guo Yujie. Result: 2-0, Shanghai University wins. Scores were 6-2, 6-</p>
<p>3. Referee: Feng Jiaozhun (Second Group) Shanghai University Xu Zengguang, Xu Zengrui vs. Soochow University Guo Yujie, Zhang Siyang. Result: 0-2, Soochow University wins. Scores were 4-6, 2-6. Referee: Bai Benli</p>

<h3 id="e150">May 3rd Incident Commemoration <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Held at the Penglai Grand Theater this morning at 9:00 AM</p>
<p>On May 3rd of the 17th year, Japanese imperialists, taking advantage of the fact that our National Revolutionary Army was heading north to directly attack Youyan, occupied Jinan to obstruct the progress of the revolution, killed our diplomats, and slaughtered our military and civilians, resulting in an unprecedented tragedy. The humiliation and shame have not yet been avenged. Today (May 3rd) is the second anniversary of the tragic incident. The preparatory committee for the May Revolution Memorial Day of all circles in the Japanese city has specially convened a memorial meeting at the Penglai Grand Theater on Penglai Road in the South City at 9:00 AM this morning. All agencies and organizations must send four representatives to participate. As for Wusong, Jiangwan, Meilong, Zhenru, etc., the local party headquarters will lead the local people to hold separate meetings to commemorate the event. The Municipal Executive Committee will also issue a public notice to the people and comrades (the text is omitted due to length).</p>
<p>The Necessary Understanding and Efforts in Commemorating the May 3rd Jinan Massacre</p>
<p>(1) Japanese imperialism has been plotting to annex Jiaoji for more than once. The outbreak of the Jinan Massacre on May 3rd of the 17th year was a major revelation of his ambition to seize Jiaoji. The massacre of about 10,000 of our military and civilians and the destruction of more than 50 million of our properties is truly a rare tragedy in the world and the greatest shame of our entire nation.</p>
<p>(2) The central government's negotiation of the Jinan case to save our Jiaoji compatriots was based on the premise of the survival interests of the entire nation. The withdrawal of the Japanese army from Jiaoji was to緩和我anti-Japanese movement by severing economic relations, not to express goodwill to us because they had realized something. In recent years, the Japanese imperialists have been constantly carrying out atrocities in Hankou, Qingdao, Xiamen, Wuhu, Liaoning, and other places, and stirring up internal strife, interfering in internal affairs, actively invading Manchuria and Mongolia, and hindering the progress of tariff autonomy and the abolition of consular jurisdiction. All of these are ironclad proof that they are intensifying their oppression and aggression against us.</p>
<p>(3) The aggression of Japanese imperialism is a sinister economic exploitation and brutal military oppression used in combination. Their methods are the most ruthless and savage, and they do not treat us as human beings. We should swear to be irreconcilable and resolutely resist his atrocities to the end by implementing revolutionary diplomacy.</p>
<p>(4) In commemorating the Jinan Incident, we should combine the old hatreds and new shames that Japanese imperialism has repeatedly inflicted on us. We should bear the burden of humiliation and intensify the promotion of the National Products Movement to sanction his economic aggression. We should continue the anti-Japanese movement to deter his wild ambitions from erupting. We should also cooperate to eliminate the remnants of the warlords such as Yan Feng, who are helping and abetting the country and harming the people, and support the government to vigorously abolish the treaties in an effort to consolidate the foundation of the party and the country's unity, independence, and self-improvement, and swear to avenge the country's shame.</p>
<p>(5) Slogans for commemorating the Jinan Massacre: 1. The Jinan Incident was an atrocity by Japanese imperialism to undermine our national revolution. 2. The Jinan Massacre is a great humiliation for our nation. 3. Adhering to economic severance is the only way to sanction Japanese aggression. 4. Continue the anti-Japanese movement to deter the wild ambitions and atrocities of the Japanese Empire. 5. Striving for the National Products Movement is the most practical and effective anti-Japanese movement. 6. To commemorate the Jinan Incident, we must work together to eliminate the remnants of the warlords and forever prevent internal strife and foreign aggression. 7. To commemorate the Jinan Incident, we must cooperate to support the central government in eliminating Yan Feng and other rebels, as well as all reactionary remnants. 8. Urge the government to use revolutionary diplomatic means to vigorously abolish unequal treaties. 9. Strive for independence and self-improvement, and swear to avenge the new and old shames. 10. Work together to resist Japanese imperialism to the end.</p>

<p>The City is Safe: Thanks to the strict precautions taken by the military and police agencies in all circles of the Chinese and foreign concessions, the World Labor Memorial May Day festival was able to pass smoothly. Order was normal in the South City, Zhabei, and other places. The rooftop gardens of the Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun three companies on Nanjing Road, as well as the Wulong Rishenglou and Tongyuchun Yiletian tea houses, all complied with the announcements from the police and temporarily suspended business.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Minister Song Issued a Declaration Yesterday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Regarding Yan Xishan's interception of Tianjin Customs Revenue, Finance Minister Song issued the following declaration regarding Yan Xishan's interception of Tianjin Customs Revenue: The act of the northern warlords to intercept the Tianjin Customs Revenue not only endangers the soundness of the entire Customs, but also infringes on the interests of the government's domestic and foreign creditors. Although those people proposed to remit the surplus 105 Customs duties to the Central Government as the amount of foreign debt that Tianjin should bear, and to intercept all the increased tariff revenue, the harm is the same because: (1) All Customs revenue has been used to pay off foreign debts and indemnities. The old 105 Customs duties, which were levied on the gold standard, are not enough for this purpose. On February 4th of this year, the government had no choice but to withdraw 5.8 million taels from its savings to make up for the shortfall. By the end of June, it is estimated that the 105 Customs duties used to pay off foreign debts will still be short by as much as 3.8 million taels. (2) The majority of the increased tariff revenue has been used to pay off domestic debts. When Yan Feng and other warlords had not yet rebelled, they had also allocated this revenue for this purpose. Today, Yan's rebellious actions are obvious, but he is still forcing banks in Tianjin and Beijing to purchase and sell bond compilation coupons guaranteed by increased tax revenue. However, the government cannot discriminate between domestic and foreign debts, except for those whose priority has been stipulated in the loan agreement. (3) When the National Government negotiated tariff autonomy, it had declared to all countries and holders of domestic public bonds that a portion of the increased tariff revenue would be used to reorganize unsecured and poorly secured domestic and foreign debts. If Yan's interception of Tianjin Customs revenue is allowed to become a reality, it will set an unprecedentedly bad precedent, not only destroying China's domestic and foreign credit, but also causing huge losses to those who purchase large amounts of public bonds in the country. If the northern military destroys the foundation of national credit by intercepting Customs revenue, the government will, of course, use all its strength to prevent it in order to protect the soundness of Customs and the credit of the country. Chinese and foreign people who care about our country's credit will undoubtedly sympathize and support this effort.</p>

<p>Double Tenth Festival This Year</p>
<p>The new tariff drafted by the National Tariff Commission has been fully drafted. Previously, because the Sino-Japanese tariff negotiations had not yet been agreed upon, this new tariff was also put on hold and could not be implemented. Now that the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement has been approved and promulgated by the governments of China and Japan, and the formal signing will take place within days, there are no longer any obstacles to international negotiations. Therefore, it has been decided to announce and implement it on the Double Tenth Festival (October 10th) this year and will notify various countries in advance for their information.</p>

<p>Japanese Government Instructs Shigemitsu to Go to Beijing to Sign</p>
<p>The full text and annexes of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement were officially passed and announced by the Japanese government on the 30th of last month. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Kijuro Shidehara telegraphed Shigemitsu Aoi, the acting minister to China, to inform him and instruct him to go to Beijing immediately to formally sign the agreement with Foreign Minister Wang in order to complete this important case as soon as possible. After receiving the above telegram yesterday evening, Acting Minister Shigemitsu immediately telegraphed the Japanese Consul in Beijing, Uemura, to inform the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that he plans to go to Beijing on the 5th of this month (Monday). The accompanying staff has been designated as Kōmori, Finance Officer, Yokotake, Commercial Officer, and Hayashi, Horinouchi, and Okazaki, the three secretaries. He has also agreed with Foreign Minister Wang to hold a formal meeting and sign the agreement and annexes in Beijing on the 6th. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 8th.</p>
<p>According to various sources yesterday, our newspaper reporters said that Mr. Shigemitsu has scheduled to enter Beijing next Monday and hold a formal signing ceremony on Tuesday. Others said that the date has not yet been determined because Foreign Minister Wang is coming to Shanghai today to attend a banquet hosted by the Cuban Minister. Shigemitsu will determine the date after consulting with Wang in Shanghai once. However, when our reporter met Shigemitsu at the Municipal Hall at a special meeting of foreign taxpayers, the reporter first asked about the number of Japanese people attending the special meeting. Mr. Shigemitsu replied that there were about 500 Japanese people attending the special meeting and that about 600 votes were cast, of which he held four votes. All of them were in favor of increasing the number of Chinese directors on the Municipal Council. The reporter then asked about the date of his trip to Beijing. According to his reply, he is scheduled to depart tomorrow (i.e., today) and sign the agreement in Beijing the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Foreign Taxpayers in the Public Concession</p>
<h3 id="e156">Yesterday's Special Meeting <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Increase in Chinese Directors at the Shanghai Municipal Council Approved</p>
<p>Five Chinese Directors to Take Office Next Wednesday</p>
<p>The foreign ratepayers of the Public Concession held a special meeting at the Municipal Hall yesterday afternoon at 3:30 PM to reconsider the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors on the Shanghai Municipal Council from three to five. Approximately one thousand people attended, with the American Consul General and Senior Consul, Mr. Cunningham, presiding as chairman. After two and a half hours of heated debate, the proposal was finally passed by a majority vote at 8:00 PM. The Municipal Council has already telegraphed the resolution to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the governments of the relevant countries for approval. The Municipal Council is scheduled to convene a board meeting next Wednesday, at which time all five Chinese directors are expected to attend, and this issue can be considered temporarily resolved.</p>
<p>Meeting Process: From the Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting</p>
<p>After the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors was rejected at the Foreign Ratepayers' Annual Meeting, tensions rose suddenly between Chinese and foreign communities. Subsequently, 64 individuals, including the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Marshall, jointly petitioned the leader of the Shanghai Consular Body, based on Article 15 of the Land Regulations of the Foreign Settlement, to convene a special meeting to reconsider the proposal as a means of rectifying the situation. Given the historical difficulty of achieving a quorum at special meetings of foreign ratepayers convened by the Municipal Council, the British Chamber of Commerce, the China Association, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, and other groups held separate meetings several days prior to the meeting to make preliminary arrangements. The Municipal Council also divided the concession area into several districts, assigning a commissioner to each district to liaise directly with the taxpayers. As a result, the attendance at yesterday's meeting broke records, with approximately one thousand people attending (representing 1,200 votes). Half of those present were Japanese, including two Japanese women. The Municipal Hall was packed to capacity, with dozens of people standing in the back. The British Consul General, Mr. Barton, arrived very early. The expert advisor to the Municipal Council, Mr. Feetham, the Japanese Consul General, Mr. Shigemitsu, and consuls from various other countries also arrived subsequently, and even the side halls were crowded.</p>
<p>Meeting Procedures According to the Land</p>
<p>Regulations of the Foreign Settlement, special meetings of foreign ratepayers must be chaired by the Senior Consul.</p>
<p>When the time for the meeting arrived, Mr. Cunningham took the chair on the stage. The Chairman of the Municipal Council, Mr. MacNaghten, the Director-General, Mr. Fessenden, and the Secretary-General, Mr. Edwards, also took their places on the stage. Chairman Cunningham announced that a quorum was present and declared the meeting officially open. Mr. Frew was elected as the meeting secretary. The opening formalities were completed within a few minutes. Then, Mr. Marshall, the Chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce, proposed the increase in the number of Chinese directors. Other individuals who gave lengthy speeches in support included former Municipal Council director Mr. Baker, former Municipal Council Chairman Mr. Arnold, and the current Japanese director of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fukushima, among others. Only one person spoke against the proposal, Mr. MacDonald. Both the pro and con speeches were several thousand words long, with the audience applauding enthusiastically when they found the speeches interesting and stamping their feet like drums when they found them tedious. Several speakers were unable to finish their speeches before stepping down from the stage. Eventually, due to the impatience of the crowd, it was proposed that the matter be put to a vote. The proposal was ultimately passed by a large majority, with only about twenty people opposing it.</p>
<p>Mr. Marshall Explains the Purpose. Mr. Marshall, the original proposer, rose to explain the purpose, saying that the reason for convening this special meeting to reconsider the issue of increasing the number of Chinese directors was due to the feeling that the previous rejection of the proposal was entirely due to misunderstanding and a lack of deep consideration. This issue has been discussed in detail in newspapers and other media over the past two weeks, but there are still one or two points of misunderstanding that I would like to clarify. There is a widespread idea that the Municipal Council made a firm guarantee regarding the increase in the number of Chinese directors, which is an overreach of authority. In fact, the Municipal Council only unanimously resolved to propose to the foreign ratepayers' annual meeting that the number of Chinese directors be increased from three to five. This is clearly stated in the minutes of the board meeting published in the Municipal Gazette on January 10 of this year (the minutes have been published previously and are omitted here). At that time, these meeting minutes were submitted to the Senior Consul and forwarded to the Chinese government through diplomatic channels, and there were no objections from any party. Therefore, the Chinese side naturally expected that it would be approved by the ratepayers and proceeded to elect five new directors. From this, it can be seen that the Municipal Council has not broken faith with either the foreign ratepayers or the Chinese community. Furthermore, the aforementioned meeting minutes clearly state that the service of the Chinese directors is deeply admired by the foreign directors. These foreign directors all work with the Chinese directors and are naturally in the best position to judge the value of their cooperation in handling difficult tasks. The rejection of this proposal by the majority of ratepayers on the 16th of last month was clearly because Judge Feetham's report had not yet been published, and it was thought that the status quo of the concession should not be changed temporarily until his investigation was completed. Little did they know that this matter had been reported to Judge Feetham, and Mr. Feetham actually said that the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors would benefit the public. At that time, Major General MacNaghten also made a solemn statement, but the ratepayers did not pay attention, otherwise I believe it would not have been rejected. I know that none of us ratepayers do not pay attention to the position of foreigners in the concession, its international nature, and the responsibilities and obligations of foreign ratepayers. However, the extremely important assistance of the Chinese residents cannot be ignored. In the past two years, there has been perfect cooperation between the three Chinese directors and the foreign directors, otherwise this proposal would not have been put forward again. We all want to obtain the cooperation and support of our Chinese friends, and we not only want to have close coordination with the outstanding members of the Chinese community, but we also deeply know that this coordination will increase the interests of the citizens. (The method of electing Chinese directors is omitted here). Now, some may think that it is weak to reconsider something after it has been decided, but if you realize that there is a mistake after the decision and reconsider it, it is not weak, but rather shows its true strength. In short, what we want to obtain and what we want to give to the Chinese are nothing more than fair dealings. I believe that the majority of those present feel that increasing the number of Chinese directors gives the Chinese a fair deal, so that they have reasonable and appropriate representation in the Municipal Council. There is also an accompanying statement that the British Chamber of Commerce and the China Association both approved this proposal at their previous meetings.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker Seconds. Mr. Baker then stood up to second Mr. Marshall's motion and said that his seconding of this proposal was based on the desire for the future administration of the Public Concession to fully cooperate with our Chinese friends. I deeply know that there are quite a few objections to this cooperation issue, because today is a slight return on one side. But we must not only care about the present, but also look to the future. Anyone who has lived in Shanghai for a long time must be proud of the development of Shanghai and the method of its governance. We have personally seen Shanghai develop from a barren town into a great port, and we will be even more proud of its progress. But we must be realistic and not endanger the future prosperity of Shanghai because of our own narrow-mindedness. We must know that there are a large number of Chinese living in the concession, their property is enormous, and they all hope that Shanghai will continue to prosper and do their best to maintain the current administration. Although their methods are different, their desire for a good name is exactly the same as ours. They absolutely do not want to endanger their own safety or depreciate the value of their property. This solid group is gradually concerned about municipal administration and can no longer be regarded as a crowd of well-meaning but irresponsible people. I think the past achievements of the Municipal Council's Chinese directors can clearly show the growing strength of this responsible citizen group. The five directors now elected are all well-known figures in the business community. I hope that after this</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>the five will take office and be loyal and fulfill their duties. I am not unable to refute the many specious arguments made against this proposal at the taxpayers' annual meeting, but I regard the gentlemen present today as a group of business people who can make a decision on this issue from a business perspective, so I will not bother to say more. Sooner or later, the administration of the Public Concession will change. This is an undeniable fact. Today, we should make early preparations to work with those who will have a greater say in municipal affairs in the future and give experienced Chinese people the opportunity to learn about Western municipal systems so that they can gradually take on the administrative affairs of the concession in the future. Isn't this wise? In all undertakings, we should avoid drastic changes. If we know that something is going to change, we should let it change gradually to avoid being forced into a sudden situation where we are unprepared and everything loses its normal course. The administration of the Public Concession is the same. Therefore, I deeply hope that you will regard this proposal as the most beneficial thing for Shanghai and as a safe guarantee for the future temporary concession administration and development that will not be affected.</p>
<p>Mr. Arnold Expresses Support. Former Municipal Council Chairman Mr. Arnold took the stage to speak, expressing his views in support of the proposal.</p>
<p>Mr. Fukushima Speaks Next. Japanese Director Fukushima spoke next, saying that it is undeniable that the Shanghai Concession is a foreign settlement. This area was designated by the Chinese government and the countries' treaties for foreigners to live, so that they can freely engage in commerce without outside interference. Therefore, the administration of the concession belongs to foreigners, which is clearly stipulated in the Land Regulations of the Foreign Settlement. Fortunately, the foresight and wisdom of our predecessors have enabled us to attract people from all over the world to become an international city. However, the residents of the concession are naturally overwhelmingly Chinese, so their interests and aspirations should also be carefully considered by the Municipal Council. In 1926, the Municipal Council voluntarily proposed to give three seats to the Chinese, which departed from the spirit of the Land Regulations of the Foreign Settlement and established the principle that there should be Chinese representation in municipal administration. I believe that you all agree that this move was wise, because from my personal experience, in the difficult environment of the past two years, without the valuable advice and cooperation of the Chinese directors, the situation we faced would have been even more serious. Today's proposal is nothing more than a further application of this principle to recognize the excellent service of the Chinese directors and to guarantee that the Westerners in Shanghai are willing to meet the fair and reasonable demands of the Chinese. I admire the speech of Mr. MacDonald at the ratepayers' annual meeting the other day, but it is an overstatement to say that passing this proposal is tantamount to selling ourselves out and harming future generations, because the number of foreign directors still far exceeds the number of Chinese directors, and the foundation of foreign management of municipal administration will not be shaken. Although the Japanese people express great sympathy for the Chinese people's desire for equality between Chinese and foreigners, they must also recognize that the right to manage the concession can only be handed over to the Chinese people when the Chinese have made real achievements in showing that they can administer fairly and provide adequate protection for the lives and property of foreigners. Because the status of the concession is an important international city in the world and also the center of China's economic life, no matter how great the cost, various methods must be used to seek the continued development and prosperity of the place. If there is an attempt to destroy its vitality, the countries concerned must work together to stop it. Although Shanghai is a place where people from all countries live together, its important interests lie entirely in commerce and industry. That so many different ethnic groups can live together in harmony under a self-governing government and prosper endlessly is proof that its residents have wisdom and common sense far beyond ordinary people, which is a good model for international cooperation. If the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors is rejected, it will be an act of undermining international coordination and a shallow and foolish plan that discerning people will never do. At present, the commercial ties between the Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai are very strong. From the point of view of foreigners, the Chinese are their best customers, and from the point of view of the Chinese, it is also the same. From the standpoint of a merchant, you must give something after you have gained something, because it is the norm for merchants, but at the same time, they must also treat their customers well. Do the ratepayers really want the Municipal Council to completely disregard the ways of merchants and offend the Chinese customers? I know that they will never do that, because only by respecting each other and caring for each other can an atmosphere of understanding and trust be created. Only with this atmosphere can commerce prosper. If you are picky about Chinese friends, there will be no end to it, but who in the world is without fault? Why is today's proposal a move in the right direction, towards mutual respect and trust? The future of Shanghai is now deeply rooted in the foundation of international goodwill, and its administration is entirely based on the wise insight and judgment of the nations concerned. There is absolutely no danger in making such concessions to the Chinese. Therefore, I hope that you will pass this proposal by an overwhelming majority to show our sincere intention to welcome Chinese cooperation.</p>
<p>Mr. Ward Scolds Mr. MacDonald. Lawyer Ward took the stage to scold Mr. MacDonald's speech the other day, calling him a dangerous element, saying that according to the unwritten law of British lawyers, they are not allowed to speak at political gatherings. Mr. MacDonald has not only violated this rule, but also used his eloquent oratory to launch a bomb that would blow the Municipal Council into the sky and lead the ratepayers into a slaughterhouse like trained sheep. Mr. MacDonald is abusing his eloquence and inciting the emotions of others and should be classified as a dangerous element. In my opinion, those who do not want to achieve anything but only seek personal victory are the least worthy of being taken. Mr. Ward's speech was very long, lasting more than twenty minutes, and the audience was impatient because it was late and they were hungry, so there was frequent noise.</p>
<p>Mr. Sheppard Speaks. Mr. Sheppard then took the stage to speak, and his wording was relatively mild. He only repeatedly stated that the ratepayers would make a big mistake if they rejected this proposal. However, the people under the stage were eager for Mr. MacDonald to reply, so they frequently made noise to stop him. Fifteen minutes later, Mr. Sheppard stepped down from the stage, and Mr. MacDonald was about to go to the stage, but Mr. Lin Xiongji, the president of the Japanese Overseas Chinese Federation, took the lead and gave a short speech in Japanese in support of the proposal. He then spent five minutes having someone translate it into English. After that, Mr. MacDonald, who was the focus of attention of the whole audience, was able to step onto the stage.</p>
<p>Mr. MacDonald's Eloquence Fails. Mr. MacDonald did not arrive at the meeting until ten minutes before six o'clock yesterday, so he sat in the back row. Even after seven people had spoken in favor of this article, he was still not discouraged and stepped onto the stage to speak. The audience thought there would be some wonderful remarks, but Mr. MacDonald first criticized the remarks made by the Municipal Council's Chinese directors, without refuting a single word. Then he criticized the declaration issued by the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, saying that since the association said that the foreign ratepayers in the concession had no right to intervene in the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors, why should the foreign ratepayers gather here today to vote on a proposal that the Chinese consider to be without the right to pass? At this point, many of the listeners became impatient and shouted to put the proposal to a vote quickly. So Mr. MacDonald stepped down from the stage in disappointment.</p>

<p>Joint Public Notice by the Social Affairs, Public Security, and Education Bureaus</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has learned that recently there have been rumors unfavorable to children in the Nanshi area, and some ignorant women have withdrawn their children from school. After sending personnel to investigate the schools, there were no facts. Therefore, it has been decided to consult with the Public Security and Education Bureaus to issue a joint public notice by the three bureaus. The original text of the joint public notice is as follows: It has been learned that recently there have been unfounded rumors unfavorable to children in the Nanshi area, and many residents are panicked. Among them, some ignorant women have listened to the rumors and have withdrawn their children from school. The rumors are widespread. After this Bureau investigated, there were no facts. It is difficult to guarantee that reactionary elements are not using ignorant people to spread rumors in an attempt to incite society and obstruct public security. This is deeply regrettable. It must be known that these rumors obviously have other purposes, and people with a little common sense will never believe them. However, if they are not investigated and prohibited quickly, they will seriously affect social stability. In addition to ordering the various districts of this Public Security Bureau to strictly investigate the rumors and arrest the rumor-mongering traitors at any time, and ordering the school principals of this Education Bureau to explain to the students' families, a joint public notice will be issued to inform the public.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Tram Strike Yesterday's News <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Comprador Comes Forward to Mediate</p>
<p>Workers Insist on Going to the End</p>
<p>The Tram Strike Committee of the Public Concession held its fifth meeting the day before yesterday and resolved several important proposals: (1) Issue leaflets to inform the workers and publish a statement in the newspaper stating that the so-called hope for the old station workers to resume work on the 2nd is purely a rumor; (2) In the near future, the Tram Strike Committee's strike department will convene a general meeting of tram workers to report on the strike situation and discuss the special requirements of the workers; (3) Strengthen their own organizational work, especially the ten-member groups and the picket team, in order to fight a protracted war with the capitalists and severely deal with the scabs and lackeys. Yesterday afternoon, when the Strike Committee held a meeting, worker Ma Zijun brought a letter from Hu Ziyu, the comprador of the tram company, to Mr. Ma and forwarded it to all the workers. The Strike Committee believes that this move by the comprador cannot truly represent the capitalists to solve any problems, but only to explore the situation of the workers. However, the Strike Committee believes that since the comprador is willing to mediate, it is certainly okay to talk. Therefore, it was decided to reply to the comprador in a letter, inviting him to come to the Strike Committee's liaison office tomorrow (i.e., today) afternoon to discuss everything. In addition, the Strike Committee decided: (1) To rescue the worker Zhang Youren, who was arrested due to the strike, by the following methods; (2) To insist that the conditions for the release of the arrested workers are not met, and to swear not to resume work until the goal is achieved; (3) To raise donations from the workers to rescue Mr. Zhang and his family; (4) To send a letter to a certain organization to help; (5) Five people were nominated from the Strike Committee's presidium to work regularly, and the staff of each department must work regularly and on time; (6) The established Shanghai East, Shanghai West, and Zhabei district offices must handle matters regularly and on time, and all workers must go to contact and report news on time; (7) The thirteen conditions must be insisted on to the end without changing a word, otherwise, they will never resume work. Attached: (1) Letter from Hu Ziyu: I am writing to inform you that the strike has been going on for many days and has not yet resumed work. Both sides have gone to extremes and nothing has been achieved. I would like to invite you to come to the writing room to discuss everything and mediate between the two sides, so that the strike can be resolved as soon as possible. This is my sincere hope. To Mr. Ma Zijun and all the workers. With my best wishes, Hu Ziyu, May 2nd. (2) Reply letter from the Strike Committee: We have received a letter from Mr. Ma Zijun showing Mr. Hu's letter, expressing Mr. Hu's willingness to mediate the strike and asking to send representatives to the writing room to discuss everything. We have submitted Mr. Hu's letter to our committee for discussion. As a result, we are very grateful for Mr. Hu's sincere mediation, but the workers have been on strike for many days, and the reason is that the company has no sincerity to negotiate the conditions with the representatives and insults the qualifications of the representatives, so the strike has not been resolved for many days. The responsibility should be borne entirely by the company. We believe that before the company has the sincerity to resolve the strike, there is no need to send representatives to the company for discussion again. We are very grateful for Mr. Hu's enthusiasm for mediation. We also very much hope that the strike will be resolved as soon as possible. Please come to our committee's liaison office tomorrow (i.e., May 3rd) from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. At that time, our committee will send representatives to have a frank talk with you. This is for Mr. Hu Ziyu.</p>

<p>Large Gambling Den Cracked Down On</p>
<h3 id="e167">No One Escaped the Net <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Gambling Den on Connaught Road</p>
<p>Entrance in the Concession, Interior in the Chinese Area</p>
<p>Over a Hundred Male Gamblers Not Allowed Bail</p>
<p>Twenty-Odd Female Gamblers Allowed Bail Through Connections</p>
<p>Over Twenty Thousand Yuan Seized Inside</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau cracked down on a roulette gambling den at No. 230 Connaught Road, an extraterritorial road in the Public Concession, at 2:00 AM the day before yesterday (1st). The details of the operation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Located at the Border of the Chinese and Concession Areas, Since taking office, Municipal Police Bureau Chief Yuan Liang has been strict in cracking down on opium and gambling. He had heard that gambling was rampant in the Sixth District, with a large-scale gambling den located on Connaught Road and Robert Dollar Road, an extraterritorial road. The building was a very deep Western-style house, with the entire building located in the Chinese area, but the main entrance was on Connaught Road, with the Concession address of No. 230. Therefore, the gambling bosses relied on the fact that the main entrance was in the Concession and were unafraid, thinking that if a raid were to occur, both the Chinese and Concession authorities could refuse to cooperate.</p>
<p>The Gambling Den Had Tight Security After Bureau Chief Yuan sent personnel to confirm the information, he once ordered the District Chief Duan Wengong to investigate and report back. District Chief Duan reported that there was indeed such a gambling den there, which had been temporarily closed but had recently reopened. This was because the main entrance was in the Concession area, the back door remained closed all year round, and the security inside the den was very tight. When gamblers arrived, the guards first slightly opened a small hole in the door and carefully examined the gamblers' faces and the license plate numbers of their cars with a flashlight to ensure they were regular customers before opening the door. Then, they used an electric bell to notify the guards in the back. If they were strangers, they would be questioned in detail and would not be allowed to enter unless they provided the names or cards of introducers. Furthermore, the house was equipped with alarm bells, and if an alarm was raised, the raiders would waste their time and gain nothing. Female Detectives Infiltrated After receiving the report, Bureau Chief Yuan hesitated and, for the sake of prudence, personally went to investigate one night (30th of last month). He secretly ordered female detectives Wang Xiuying and others to disguise themselves as gamblers and infiltrate the den first. Then, he ordered the Supervisory Division to send officers along with more than forty fully armed police officers from the Security Brigade to secretly drive to the location at around 2:00 AM the next morning. Upon arrival, he ordered the entire house to be surrounded first, then a secret signal was given, and the inside and outside responded in unison, with the brigade rushing in all at once. As a result, no one inside escaped the net and all were captured.</p>
<p>Men Not Allowed Bail In this operation, no one escaped the net. A total of 105 male gamblers and employees of the den were arrested (some say 101), along with 22 female gamblers. Six cars were also seized and transported to the headquarters in separate cars. Bureau Chief Yuan immediately ordered all those arrested to be temporarily detained in the Detective Team, with a large number of Security Team members guarding them. No one was allowed to visit or bail them out, but the female gamblers were given special leniency and allowed to be bailed out first.</p>
<p>Hearings Not Open to the Public Around 3:00 PM that afternoon, the Judicial Section conducted preliminary interrogations in batches and then temporarily detained everyone in the detention center. The interrogation was extremely cautious, and even bureau employees were not allowed to attend. Therefore, the names and exact number of people were unknown. According to eyewitnesses, a total of 149 men and women were arrested at the time. The cash seized in the den amounted to over 20,000 yuan. A detailed inventory is being prepared for transfer to the court. It was originally intended to transfer them yesterday, but due to unfinished procedures, the transfer is expected to take place today.</p>
<p>Underground Cellar in the Gambling Den In addition to the gamblers, two roulette wheels, a large number of chips, and two pistols (licensed and unlicensed), three sets of opium smoking paraphernalia, and an elaborately constructed underground cellar specifically for storing gambling equipment were found in the den. After the search, guards were temporarily assigned to watch over the items, and the gamblers were escorted to the headquarters.</p>
<p>The Gambling Boss is Unknown It is said by insiders that the gambling den is ostensibly run by a Westerner, but is actually set up by someone else. Bureau Chief Yuan is currently conducting an investigation.</p>

<p>Reward of a Thousand Gold for the Capture of All Culprits</p>
<p>On the morning of the 25th of last month, a case of assassination of seven men, women, and children occurred at the home of Guo Chunsen at No. 1169 Edinburgh Road. The suspects in the case, Guo Songan and the maid Chonggui, fled without a trace after the incident. The various police stations in the Public Concession paid close attention to this case, sending out detectives in secret searches. In addition to requesting the Shanghai Special District Court to issue warrants for their arrest, the Municipal Council's Police Department offered a reward of 1,000 dollars and published the portraits of the two criminals on reward posters. The reward poster is copied below: Reward for Arrest Regarding the case of seven murders that occurred at No. 1169 Edinburgh Road on April 25, 1930 (Western calendar), a reward of 1,000 dollars will be given to anyone who captures all the murderers in this case and obtains their confessions. The people in the picture have already been issued arrest warrants by the Shanghai Special District Court, and this office also urgently wants to know their whereabouts because the criminals are of great importance to this case. All persons are requested to pay attention and cooperate in the arrest to prevent them from escaping. If you have any information, please report it to the nearest police station or directly notify the Chief of Police.</p>

<h3 id="e169">Trial Opens for Property Dispute Case <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Qiu Sheng San Still Has Not Reported</p>
<p>Court Will Not Allow Further Postponement</p>
<p>Trial Debates Concluded Yesterday</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Still Hoping For Settlement</p>
<p>With regards to the three million in inheritance from Qiu Peishan, the late father of Qiu Dingbao, Qiu Peishan’s daughter, and due to the inheritance being entirely managed by her older brother, has sought legal representation to sue the Provisional Court demanding one million of the inheritance. After three court sessions, the defendant Qiu Sheng San, the elder brother, has made excuses for not attending.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s Proceedings Yesterday morning, the Shanghai Special District Court’s Judge Yang held court again, summoning the defendant who was still absent. The legal representative stated that the defendant was perhaps ill while abroad, and though family has sent calls for the defendant to return to Shanghai, there has been no return message. The legal representative requested a postponement of 14 days to allow the defendant to return to Shanghai and proceed with reconciliation. The Plaintiff’s legal representative opposed, saying that this has already been the fourth hearing, and the defendant’s absence demonstrates the lack of desire to reconcile. The Plaintiff has requested that the case proceed quickly to avoid delays. Judge Yang ordered both parties to proceed with the hearing. Should reconciliation be desired, it can be addressed after the conclusion of the debates.</p>
<p>Demanding One Million The Plaintiff Qiu Dingbao was then summoned to testify that her father died twenty-two years prior and her mother has also passed. The defendant is her elder brother and manages the inheritance of three million, and the Plaintiff demands one million from the inheritance. Given the case details that have been repeatedly stated by the Plaintiff, there is no need for further questioning.</p>
<p>Oppressed by Elder Brother and Sister-in-Law The order to begin debates followed. The Plaintiff's legal representative stated that the case involves half-siblings. The Plaintiff was raised by the Defendant and his wife, and was subjected to the oppression of the brother and sister-in-law. Her marriage was arranged by the brother with the offer of certain benefits, but once the marriage was completed there was no dowry, resulting in the Plaintiff marrying a poor man. After disagreements, the Defendant gave the Plaintiff ten thousand. The Plaintiff is the younger sister, and the Defendant should respect the wishes of the parents and distribute the inheritance. Now that this has not happened, the Plaintiff has no choice but to ask the court for adjudication.</p>
<p>Whether the Parents Were Pleased The Defendant’s legal representative began with a counter-argument that the Plaintiff’s marriage occurred during the Guangxu era, and there is no right to claim inheritance. The Plaintiff is aware of this, and thus is now citing precedent from the Dali Court that if parents were pleased the Court could allocate a portion of the inheritance. However, there is no proof the parents were pleased, and assuming they were then the financial circumstances must be considered.</p>
<p>Inaccurate Marriage History Regarding the claim of marriage, Qiu Peishan passed during the Guangxu 34th year and only had 50,000 in assets as can be seen in the Dechangrun ledgers. Even if some portion is allocated, it should be based on the financial situation at that time. Furthermore, when the Plaintiff was 15 years old she eloped with a man by the name of Lu, and the Defendant reported the elopement to the police and requested the lawyer declare the severance of relations. The Plaintiff's complaint about the marriage is therefore inaccurate. The Defendant gave the Plaintiff ten thousand in remembrance of their sibling relationship, even after her marriage.</p>
<p>Self Acquired Assets As for the Defendant’s current assets, most of it has been acquired by the Defendant. The Plaintiff’s claims are groundless and should be rejected, with the Plaintiff being ordered to pay legal fees.</p>
<p>Wedding Pictures The Plaintiff’s legal representative stood to retort that the Defendant’s claim that Plaintiff had eloped is false. The Defendant’s daughter would not have been a bridesmaid at the wedding had it been an elopement. There are pictures that can prove this.</p>
<p>Request to Seize Assets Regarding the financial situation, according to precedents the financial assets should be considered at the time of the split. If the assets at the time of inheritance are less than those at the time of the split, the additional funds are considered derived from the inheritance and shall be judged based on the asset conditions at the time of the split. However, the Plaintiff needs to make a solemn statement that there is concern the Defendant will hide assets, making future enforcement difficult. The Plaintiff requests the asset to be seized in advance to prevent it from being hidden.</p>
<p>Another Opportunity for Reconciliation Judge Yang declared that the debates are concluded and another opportunity is being afforded to both parties to reach reconciliation and the verdict date will be extended by two weeks. The judge has requested both parties to make concessions and reconcile out of court, and if there is no reconciliation by the deadline then the verdict will be declared.</p>

<p>The Police's Lawyer Accuses a Kidnapping Case</p>
<p>Reclassified as a Case of Extortion</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Case are Very Complex</p>
<p>Four Defendants Remanded in Custody for Further Review</p>
<p>Tan Tingjin, a woman from Jiangwan and concubine of Cao Xiaolong, who resides at No. 2024 Hongrui Lane, Xinzha Road, was forcibly dragged away around 8:00 PM on April 10th while going to Yanzike in Baoyu Lane in the French Concession to smoke opium, disappearing instantly. Cao searched everywhere but found no trace of her. By April 29th, Cao suddenly received a threatening letter demanding 5,000 dollars and requiring him to contact a person with a bamboo pole the next day in Kuling Road. Cao took the letter to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detective Ruan Yao to secretly wait for a long time, but no bandits arrived. The detective returned to the police station. The day before yesterday, Chief Detective Wang Hongsheng and Feng Zhiming of the General Inspectorate of the General Police Station learned that Tan Tingjin was hidden at No. 16 Mill Lane on Avenue du General Foch in the French Concession. They cooperated with Western detective Kayner and detectives from the French Concession to rescue Tan and arrest the suspects Zhang Asan from Pudong, Li Jinbiao from Suzhou, and Zhang's concubine Wang Afeng from Ningbo. They were all brought back to the police station. Zhang confessed that the letter was written by a man named Liu from Ningbo (Liu is a clerk for a certain lawyer) who resided at No. 4 Lianzhu Lane on Avenue Edward VII. The Chinese and Western detectives went to arrest Liu and detained him separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Shanghai Special District Court. Judge Wu Tingqi and Prosecutor Xu Mei attended the court to question the defendants. Zhang Asan and Wang Afeng hired lawyer Fan Gang, and Liu also hired lawyers Yuan and Shen to defend them. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stood up to present the case and stated that the police originally charged the case as a kidnapping under Article 371 of the Criminal Law, but after detailed research by the lawyers, the charge should be amended to extortion under Article 370 of the Criminal Law. The Chinese detective Feng Zhiming and the Western detective then submitted reports explaining the circumstances of the case's cracking. The plaintiff Cao Xiaolong stated that he was from Jiangbei and opened a Dingkang cigarette paper store. Tan Tingjin was his concubine, and they had been living together for two or three years. On April 10th, Tan went out to smoke opium and suddenly disappeared on Dongxinqiao Street. He searched for her without success until he received a threatening letter on the 29th asking him to negotiate and extort 5,000 dollars. He reported to the police, but they failed to catch the suspects. Tan Tingjin stated that she wanted to go to Baoyu Lane to smoke opium that night. While walking on Dongxinqiao Street, Zhang, Li, and Wang dragged her into a car they had hired, covered her eyes, and stuffed her mouth, driving her to Mill Lane and detaining her for more than two weeks until the police officers arrived to rescue her yesterday. She had no relationship with Liu. Judge Wu reviewed the statements and questioned the four defendants one by one. Because the circumstances of the case were very complex, it was necessary to postpone the hearing. The four defendants were remanded in custody separately. The plaintiff Cao Xiaolong was ordered to find a shop guarantor who would be available for questioning at any time, and the hearing was postponed to a later date.</p>
<p>Robbery of the Four Banks' Preparation Vault</p>
<h3 id="e171">Trial With Complete Evidence <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Police Add Two Kidnapping Cases</p>
<p>Robbers are Sworn Brothers</p>
<p>Details of the trial of the robbery of the Four Banks' Preparation Vault have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun Yuan of the Shanghai Special District Court and Prosecutor Xu Mei continued the trial. The police representative, lawyer Gan Jingxian, stated that the police had complete evidence for the robbery case and could now try the two kidnapping cases added by the police against defendants Yuan Genfa and Fu Aquan. Sheng Jinxin and Lou Kenzai were then summoned to testify in the kidnapping case. Bao Cailiang stated that the plaintiff Sheng Jinxin was ill and unable to attend court today, but would be able to attend and be questioned at the next hearing, so he was delegated to attend as a representative. However, he did not know the details of how Sheng was kidnapped and submitted a letter of authorization. Judge Sun ruled that Bao could not provide any evidence and ordered him to withdraw. Detective Liang Chengyu reported that he had summoned the plaintiff Lou Kenzai to the Quanyegong Bank yesterday, but he had not arrived today. Defendant Yuan Genfa denied the kidnapping completely and was evasive about the robbery of the Four Banks' Preparation Vault. Defendant Fu Aquan confessed that he had seen the informant in the case at Room 9 of the Huizhong Hotel. He was not at the scene during the robbery, but later learned that the case was committed by Da Guibao, Fu Bao, Xiao Abao, Fuchang, Li Meidi, Bao Sheng, and an unnamed driver. He also received 1,000 dollars. There were a total of 11 sworn brothers, namely Li Meidi, Zhang Amao, Yang Yonglin, Yang Yongqing, Chen Jinsheng (i.e., the third defendant), Miao Fengxiang, Yuan Amao, Da Age, and himself and others. However, he also denied the two kidnapping cases. Feng Jiaosheng and Lu Zhongfang, employees of the Bank of Communications, testified that the defendant Zhou Zhikang was working as an agent for the bank and that they were sent out on errands both in the morning and afternoon of the day of the incident. Judge Sun reviewed the statements and ordered the case to be postponed for further testimony.</p>

<p>Family Insults, Assaults, and Chases</p>
<p>Forced to Drown in the Huangpu River, No Trace Found</p>
<p>Gu Baochu, a 22-year-old from Chongming, became an adopted son-in-law in the home of Ni Zhu, a woman from Sanbing Wharf in Pudong, and married her daughter Gu Zhu. Because of the matriarchal family structure, he had to be submissive. Baochu also had to support his wife's family. Around 7:00 PM the night before last, Ni Zhaoming, Ni Zhu's son, started a fight with Gu Baochu over money. The mother, son, and daughters ganged up and drove Gu Baochu out. Gu Baochu fled the door, but they refused to stop and chased him with weapons, forcing Gu Baochu to retreat with nowhere else to go before falling into the Huangpu River, with unknown life or death. He has been missing ever since. Gu Jianchu and others, Gu's brothers, knew that their brother had been chased and killed by Ni Zhu and others and had fallen into the Huangpu River and drowned. Because Ni Zhaoming had fled, they took Ni Zhu and Gu Ni, the mother and daughter, to the Third District Second Precinct for questioning. Ni Zhu and others claimed that Gu Baochu owed 30 yuan to a fellow villager, Niaolongjiang, and his brother Gu Jianchu and others had beaten Gu Baochu to death, so they were seeking redress. The precinct also summoned Niaolongjiang for questioning, but he did not mention anything about debt collection. The precinct combined the two cases and sent them to the District Court for preliminary hearing. The results were that Ni Zhu and Gu Ni were ordered to be detained, and the others were dismissed. They were also ordered to find the body and report for autopsy.</p>

<p>Impersonates a Customs Officer and Searches at Will</p>
<p>Well-Mannered and Fluent in English</p>
<p>Around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, a young man wearing a customs officer's hat and a suit, resembling a customs inspector, jumped onto the Jinliyuan Wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and fled in a hurry. He was closely pursued by crew members of the Xinming ship. He was encountered by Chinese constables from the Sixteenth Concession French Police Station, who, suspecting his behavior, took him to the police station for questioning. He claimed to be Zheng Qingde, 24 years old, from Ningbo. While he was being questioned, a representative from the Xinming ship reported that Zheng had impersonated a customs officer, boarded the ship, and searched at will. Fortunately, the comprador had discovered it, and they were about to detain him when he escaped. The police station, seeing that Zheng was well-mannered and fluent in English, and seemingly a member of the intellectual class who engaged in vulgar behavior, notified the customs water police to take him for interrogation.</p>

Dr. Miller's opening speech stated that the Shanghai Sanitarium Branch will soon receive poor patients in Shanghai. He was deeply pleased to announce this to the public. One year ago, 200,000 gold was raised from all walks of life to build this hospital, which was no small feat and was well known to everyone.

He deeply admired the enthusiasm of those who donated and raised funds. The Chinese people were the most enthusiastic among the donors, with four-fifths of the donations coming from the Chinese. This hospital is specifically for the poor, and the annual expenses are donated by individuals, businesses, and the Shanghai Municipal Council.

<p>His Father Died</p>
<p>Instructed by the English firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which submitted a report from the owner of the Yusheng steamboat, stating that on April 17th, the ship departed from Tanggu for Shanghai carrying passengers Guo He, Cheng Chunsheng, Cheng Shaojian, and Meng Dong, among others. Around 9 PM that evening, the second watch reported that a passenger had jumped overboard. The ship immediately stopped to investigate, but there were no traces. Upon inquiry, it was revealed that the deceased, Guo He, from Zhili (Hebei), had a history of mental illness. He had a son named Guo Yinfu in Shanghai, but his address was unknown. It was also mentioned that they came to Shanghai in connection with the Tangjiawan Police Station in the Second District of the Western District. The following night, at 10:45 PM, Meng Dong attempted to jump overboard but was stopped by Cheng Chunsheng and Cheng Shaojian. The shipowner, fearing accidents, detained them until arrival in Shanghai, where they were released. The Consul-General considered the report suspicious and requested the relevant authorities to investigate. Upon receiving the instruction, the Social Bureau immediately noted that the whereabouts of Cheng Chunsheng and the others after arriving in Shanghai were unknown, and the address of the deceased's son, Guo Yinfu, was also unknown, making the investigation difficult. In addition to contacting the Public Security Bureau to await notification from the Second District, the Bureau sincerely hopes that Cheng Chunsheng and others, as well as Guo Yinfu himself, will come to the Bureau for questioning to ascertain the truth. It also hopes that relatives and friends of Cheng and others will assist in the search and report to the Bureau for verification. A Shop Assistant Died After Falling While Wiping Windows</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the business community and develop commerce throughout the country, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has specially reorganized and improved communication among major ports. Currently, there are direct communication lines to: Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Yantai, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Songjiang, Chuansha, Liuhe, Hupu, Wusong, and other places. In areas with heavy business traffic, such as Nanjing, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai, the latest duplex high-speed machines have been installed, capable of transmitting and receiving over a hundred words per minute simultaneously. Furthermore, with the growing commerce in areas north of Zhenjiang, such as Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Rugao, Nantong, Qingjiangpu, Qingkou, and Haizhou, and the increasing demand for telecommunications by the business community, the Shanghai-Zhenjiang line has been upgraded with high-speed machines to facilitate communication. The Dalian telegrams have been rerouted through the Yantai-Dalian submarine cable for faster delivery. The Bureau's communications staff has undergone extensive training at telecommunications schools, and the deployed personnel are all skilled operators. With over fifty years of experience in wired communications, errors are minimal, and the results are outstanding, providing great satisfaction to all sectors and earning widespread praise.

<h3 id="e181">Letter from the May 30th Public Cemetery Board of Directors <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Reply to the May 30th Public Cemetery Board of Directors:</p>
<p>We have received your letter stating that the May 30th Martyrs' Cemetery is a monument to the national awakening movement of our country and is of great importance to the National Revolution. Thanks to your continued attention, the drainage ditch of the cemetery has not yet been constructed. Whenever it rains, the water accumulates and does not drain. Therefore, the Board of Directors, Cheng Bianchun, Wang Binyan, and Wang Yansong, were specially dispatched to meet with you to request that the Bureau of Public Works be ordered to construct the drainage ditch to drain the accumulated water. We are extremely grateful. Upon receiving this, we ordered the Bureau of Public Works to investigate. The Bureau's reply stated that, after consulting with the May 30th Public Cemetery Board of Directors on the 8th of this month, personnel were dispatched to survey the site. If the drainage pipes were completely constructed to connect to the main public road drainage ditch, the project would be extensive and costly. A lighter and easier solution would be to fill the low-lying areas with coal ash, deepen the existing ditches, and install drainage pipes through the walls at the north and south ends. The north end would directly connect to the neighboring field ditch, and the south end would open a drainage ditch along the path to connect to the creek. The Bureau considers this drainage project to be urgently needed and has decided to adopt the latter method, immediately ordering construction to begin so that it can be completed before the memorial period of this year, preventing further water accumulation. The estimated cost of approximately two hundred yuan will be covered by the Bureau's regular expenses. This is a report of the Bureau's handling of the matter. Please take note.</p>
<p>Addressed to the May 30th Public Cemetery Board of Directors.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Informing Rice Dealers to Affix Stamps <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Director Zhao of the Shanghai Precious Metal Stamp Tax Bureau sent a letter to the Zhabei Rice Guild, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Guild, and the Jiahetang Rice Exchange stating:</p>
<p>Since our Bureau was instructed to abolish the recognition and sale method, all commercial books, receipts, and other documents should be stamped in accordance with the regulations. This has been repeatedly announced and urged. However, upon investigation, it was found that commercial receipts on the market were often stamped with the "Stamp Tax Paid" seal, which violates the regulations and hinders tax revenue. Strict measures were taken to ban and publicize this practice. However, during this inspection, it was again found that various firms in the industry were still using stamps with the "Stamp Tax Paid" seal on their invoices. This kind of concealment and trickery is a blatant violation of the tax law. Such practices were not allowed even before the abolition of the recognition and contract system, let alone now that tax administration is being reorganized and stamps are being affixed in practice. The Provincial Bureau has repeatedly ordered that such practices be prohibited. The evidence obtained this time was originally intended to be reported for legal action. However, after reviewing the case, the rice dealers claimed that these invoices were stamped in advance and left over from the past, and that they were mistakenly used due to a temporary oversight and should be treated leniently. We have agreed to treat the case leniently and submit the evidence to the Review Committee for judgment and fines, without further investigation. Our Bureau handles tax affairs in accordance with the law. At present, all industries are uniformly affixing stamps, and the old recognition and sale system has been completely abolished. This has been communicated and announced, and should be commonly known. We fear that the industry may not be paying attention and may continue to make mistakes. In addition to dispatching personnel to inspect, we are writing to your Guild to request that you promptly inform all member firms to comply with the regulations. In the future, invoices, receipts, and other documents must be stamped in accordance with the regulations and must not be stamped with private seals. We also urge you to destroy any remaining unused invoices that have been stamped to avoid future problems. Please reply for our records.</p>
<p>The Appeal of the Foil Industry Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foil Industry Association, regarding the six articles of the newly issued Measures for the Prohibition of Superstitious Items by the Ministry of Interior, which require conversion to other industries within one year, submitted a petition to Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government and various ministers on April 29, Year 19, requesting a temporary suspension of the prohibition. The original text of the telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, President Tan of the Executive Yuan, Minister Niu of the Ministry of Interior, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce:</p>
<p>We have read the Zhenri Daily, which reported that the Ministry of Interior has drafted six articles of measures for the prohibition of superstitious items and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for approval and circulation to all provinces, cities, and counties for compliance. Article 2 of the measures stipulates that all operators of superstitious items must convert to other legitimate businesses within one year from the date of promulgation. Article 4 stipulates that if operators of superstitious items continue to operate after the expiration of the time limit, the Public Security Bureau shall order them to cease operations. Since the promulgation of these measures, the Shanghai Municipal Government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to send police to visit shops selling tin foil paper, firecrackers, paper money, yellow paper, paper dolls, and other funerary items to inform them that they must convert to other businesses within one year, otherwise they will be forced to close at the end of the period. It is heard that the Public Security Bureaus in various counties under Jiangsu Province, such as Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, and Wuxi, are implementing this plan even more strictly, and have already sent police to visit tin foil and other shops to inform them that they can only sell off their existing stock and cannot import any more. Such reckless actions, disregarding people's livelihoods, are shocking. The industrialists and businessmen in Shanghai who have received the notice to convert their businesses are all running around in panic and fear. It is found that tin foil is produced in Zhejiang and sold mainly in Jiangsu. The tin raw material comes from Yunnan, and the paper used for the foil comes from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces. Although these items are superstitious, the livelihoods of millions of industrialists and businessmen depend on them. At a time when disasters are frequent, taxes are heavy, and most industries are failing, leading to an increasing number of unemployed workers and greater suffering for the people, the government should uphold the late Premier's Principle of People's Livelihood, devise methods to support existing production to increase wealth and stabilize society, and allow all reforms to proceed gradually. However, the measures drafted by the Ministry of Interior only provide for the prohibition of operation and do not provide for the resettlement of the unemployed, nor do they indicate or plan for alternative industries. If these measures are resolutely implemented without regard for the livelihoods of millions of industrialists and businessmen, and the number of unemployed workers is increased, the strong will inevitably take risks and be exploited by others, while the weak will become beggars and fill the streets. Social order will be immediately disrupted, which is not what our government, which earnestly desires to govern, should do. We believe that burning paper money to worship ghosts and gods is indeed a superstition, but the ancients established religious teachings to promote morality and law, which are not without benefit to the world and the human heart. We believe that our revolutionary government's policy of eliminating superstition is a matter of course, but in our humble opinion, it should be done by starting with popularizing education and enlightening the people, so that it can gradually achieve results and not cause problems. When the country is prosperous and the constitution is implemented, superstitious practices will inevitably disappear on their own. At a time when the country is in distress, the people are suffering greatly, and reactionaries are taking the opportunity to incite unrest, it is imperative to maintain social stability and increase existing production. The measure to prohibit the operation of superstitious items within a limited time is not timely. We respectfully read Chairman Chiang's speech at the weekly memorial service for the late Premier in the National Government, in which he stated that before the government has prepared a perfect plan to resettle the majority of unemployed workers, the prohibition of burning paper money should be temporarily suspended. His benevolent words are in line with the late Premier's legacy of caring for the people's livelihoods. Governments at all levels should uphold this virtue and implement it consistently. Furthermore, at this time of serious situation, when reactionary elements are plotting to incite labor unrest and disrupt the rear, the original proposal was made by Hebei Province, and we should investigate whether there are other motives involved. This is not an overreaction on our part, but because it hinders the people's livelihoods and social security, we have to state it in detail. We earnestly request your review of the advantages and disadvantages, and that the prohibition be temporarily suspended until the government has formulated a guide for converting businesses and has established large-scale factories to accommodate the majority of unemployed workers, in order to stabilize social order and leave a glimmer of hope for millions of people. We urgently submit this petition and respectfully request your government and ministries to review and comply with it.</p>

<p>Coolie Killed by Car</p>
<p>On the 1st of the previous day, at 10:40 AM, a certain person resembling a coolie, about 40 years old, was walking in the middle of the road in the Baochang Road area of the French Concession.

<h3 id="e185">Shanghai Yarn's Suspension of Shipment to Ningbo <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Reasons for the Suspension of Shipment</p>
<p>Shanghai cotton yarn is a major export, and much of it is shipped to Ningbo by the Shanghai-Ningbo liners of the Taikoo, China Merchants, Ningshao, and Sanbei companies. In late April, various yarn mills and cotton yarn firms in this port received a telegram from Ningbo stating that the import tax on cotton yarn in Ningbo would be increased because the local contracted amount had been increased from 400,000 yuan per year to 1,000,000 yuan. The tax on cotton yarn shipped from Shanghai would be increased by six-tenths. As a result, the yarn mills and yarn firms in this port decided to stop shipping cotton yarn to Ningbo starting from May 1, resulting in this suspension of shipment.</p>
<p>Rushing Shipments Beforehand</p>
<p>Because the yarn firms in Shanghai received the news earlier, they negotiated tonnage with the four companies for the existing 5,000 to 6,000 pieces of cotton yarn and rushed to ship them to Ningbo within five days before April 29. Therefore, the Xinjiangtian, Xin Ningshao, Ningxing, and Shengjing, and other ships from Shanghai to Ningbo were fully loaded with cotton yarn, each carrying more than a thousand pieces. The last batch was shipped by Xin Ningshao and Xinjiangtian, and all of them arrived at the port before the 30th.</p>
<p>Two-Month Suspension of Shipment</p>
<p>Since May 1, no cotton yarn has been shipped from Shanghai to Ningbo. It is heard that the yarn firms estimate that the yarn shipped from Shanghai in advance is enough to meet the needs of the cloth mills in Ningbo for two months. Therefore, it was publicly agreed that no cotton yarn from Shanghai will be allowed to be shipped to Ningbo in May and June. The yarn firms have not actually expressed any opposition to the tax increase.</p>
<p>Minutes of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Foreign Affairs Discussion Association</p>

<h3 id="e186">The Yangtze River Trade Plummets to Unprecedented Lows Since the Founding of the Republic <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River route has always been the most important shipping lane, with passenger and cargo traffic consistently exceeding that of coastal routes. As a result, British, Japanese, and American foreign merchants have all invested their full efforts to compete in this route's shipping industry. However, according to various shipping companies, the decline in trade and the lack of import and export goods on this route this year are unprecedented since the founding of the Republic. The recent sharp decline and sluggishness of the route are investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<p>Six Companies Reduce Water Freight: The six Yangtze River shipping companies (namely Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company, and San Peh Steam Navigation Company) had decided in mid-March to uniformly increase freight rates for both upstream and downstream routes by 15% to maintain operations, due to rising gold prices and falling silver values, which increased the cost of ship materials and senior crew wages. However, in the past half-month, the Yangtze River trade has plummeted due to the impact of the current situation, with an extreme shortage of downstream goods from Hankou to Shanghai. In addition, cargo from Sichuan rivers like Yichang and Shashi has also been cut off. Consequently, the import cargo carried daily to Shanghai by more than thirty Chinese and foreign Yangtze River ships has decreased by 70% to 80% compared to before. The six companies commonly believe that this is a rare and special situation and have been holding discussions in recent days to find remedies. It is reported that they have decided to start by reducing water freight to encourage transport. Yesterday, it was heard that a consensus was reached to reduce downstream freight rates from Hankou to Shanghai by 15% from today, and all customers have been notified.</p>
<p>Rice Seizures Affect Shipping: Anhui Province has traditionally been a rice-producing region, with a large amount of rice transported from ports such as Anqing and Wuhu to Shanghai every year. However, this year there is not a single grain of Anhui rice loaded. Currently, Anhui is experiencing a rice shortage and cannot meet the needs of the province itself. A large-scale rice seizure by famine victims occurred in Anqing the day before yesterday. Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from Anhui stating that two thousand several hundred piculs of rice were seized in Anqing overnight. The Anhui authorities have now implemented a policy of selling rice at a fixed price of ten yuan per picul, with each person only allowed to buy five sheng. At the same time, Wuhu has also limited each person to buying one dou and prohibited the export of Anhui rice, forbidding it from being loaded onto ships. Anyone found carrying more than five dou of rice onto a ship will have it confiscated, so Yangtze River ships dare not even buy rice for their own consumption at the ports of Anhui and Wuhu. The transportation of other goods to Shanghai has also decreased due to the impact of the rice seizure case.</p>
<p>Jian Guo and Other Ships Resume Operations: The Jian Guo ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has returned to Shanghai after personnel from the Hankou headquarters returned to Beijing. It arrived yesterday. In addition, the Jiang Xin ship, which had also suspended operations, has been released and returned to Shanghai and is expected to resume its schedule in the next few days. There is also the Jiang Yu ship, for which the company telegraphed Beijing yesterday to request its release. Ning Shao Steam Navigation Company also received a telegram from Wuhu yesterday stating that the Yu Lun had resumed normal operation yesterday and had sailed upstream to Hankou. However, business is slow, and the transportation fees do not even cover the costs of coal and wages.</p>
<p>War Protection for Ships on the Upper Yangtze: The Chinese merchant ships operating on the Hankou-Yichang route have recently installed bulletproof plates outside the passenger cabins and engine rooms. According to a telegram from Shashi, although there are slightly fewer communists in the area recently, the farmlands in various villages are still covered with small white flags and many reactionary slogans, and there are still incidents of merchant ships being attacked from time to time, so customers dare not load goods to Hankou. The issue of salary increases for river pilots on British merchant ships in Shanghai is expected to be resolved soon. Therefore, Butterfield &amp; Swire has ordered the Wanxian and other ships to load the large quantities of cotton yarn that had been accumulated in Shanghai during the suspension last month and immediately sail to Yichang to wait for the river pilots to return to work and resume navigation on the rivers of Sichuan.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality Electrical Machinery and Silk Weaving Industry Association</p>

<h3 id="e188">A Discussion on the May Festivals - Yan Qian <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The year belongs to all the world, and May is of course shared by the world. But unfortunately, China's May has become inauspicious. There is the May 9th, and then the May 30th. The bloodstains of the May 30th have not yet dried, and then there is the May 3rd. Living in May, with no hope of washing away shame, and deeply worried about the country's difficulties, how can one not be filled with sorrow? Therefore, based on my humble thoughts, I will discuss the May festivals, also with the intention of "citizens, do not vainly forget your shame," and to slightly comfort patriotic compatriots filled with sorrow and indignation.</p>
<p>The Interplay of "Birth" and "Destruction" in the May Festivals: "Birth" and "destruction" are originally theories of numerology and should not be used to discuss the May festivals. However, things happen by coincidence, and it can be said that there is a reason for it. It does not hurt to force an interpretation and discuss the interplay of "birth" and "destruction." Are there not the May 1st, May 3rd, May 4th, May 5th, May 9th, and May 30th festivals in May? These festivals are precisely interrelated in terms of "birth" and "destruction." The labor movement of the May 1st festival evolved and, under the guns of the great powers, produced the May 30th. This can be said as the May 1st giving birth to the May 30th, or the May 1st destroying the May 30th. The May 9th, a day of national humiliation, gave rise to the May 4th, a youth national salvation movement. This is the May 9th giving birth to the May 4th, and the May 4th destroying the May 9th. The May 5th revolutionary festival, when the Premier took office as the Extraordinary President in Guangzhou, was a positive demonstration of overthrowing the warlords and the imperialists, which aroused deep hatred from powerful neighbors, leading to open provocations against the revolutionary army and the people, and resulting in the tragic May 3rd National Humiliation Day. This is the May 5th giving birth to the May 3rd, which is also the May 5th destroying the May 3rd. If our compatriots understand the principle of this interplay between "birth" and "destruction" and become even more invigorated, then there will be a day for washing away the shame.</p>
<p>The Transfer of the "Poisonous Month": According to our country's customs, May has traditionally been regarded as the "poisonous month," but the "poisonous month" at that time was not truly "poisonous." Now, when applied to the Gregorian calendar, May becomes a truly "poisonous month." Among the festivals and customs of the abolished lunar calendar that can be applied to the Gregorian calendar, the name "poisonous month" is the most appropriate. Thus, it can be said that the name "poisonous month" has been transferred from the abolished lunar calendar to the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>The First Dragon Boat Festival: Recently, the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior jointly submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, advocating that after the rigorous implementation of the Gregorian calendar, all previous holidays from the abolished lunar calendar, such as the Lantern Festival, Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Double Ninth Festival, should be observed as rest days. Except for the Mid-Autumn Festival, which should be changed to the nearest full moon of the Autumn Equinox, the others should still follow the Gregorian calendar dates for rest, and various festival activities such as lantern viewing on the Lantern Festival, dragon boat racing on the Dragon Boat Festival, and moon viewing on the Mid-Autumn Festival should be restored as appropriate entertainment. Therefore, this year's May 5th will be the first Dragon Boat Festival after the rigorous implementation of the Gregorian calendar. It is recalled that Mr. Dai Jitao once said that dragon boat racing on the Dragon Boat Festival is one of the sports activities that should be promoted. His words are indeed important. It is meaningful to carry out a sporting activity on a festival that symbolizes the Premier's struggle. I say that the old customs of burning Atractylodes lancea and Dahurian angelica, and sprinkling realgar wine at the doors and in the courtyards as a detoxification and cleaning exercise can also be continued, and the exercise can be extended to May 15th, the statutory cleaning exercise day. Wouldn't that be even more meaningful? - Yang Weiyu's Lecture Notes, Recorded by Ren Yu</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Weiyu has served as the deputy director of the China Vocational Education Society for many years. He is knowledgeable and has a long-standing reputation. A few days ago, he accepted an invitation from Hubei Minli Middle School to give a lecture on career issues for middle school students. I listened quietly in the audience and felt that Mr. Yang's words were like gold and jade, and could be used as a compass for those middle school students who were wandering in the path of career choices.</p>
<p>A Humorous Opening: It is my humble opinion that the opening of a speech should be met with a smile... - Hai Ke</p>
<p>Teacher: What is the difference between the sun and the moon?</p>
<p>Student: Teacher, the sun is bigger and healthier than the moon because it sleeps every morning, while the moon stays up all night and travels outside every night, so its face is pale and its body is very weak.</p>
<p>甲: Is the house that Lao Bing lives in his own or rented?</p>
<p>乙: I heard that it is his own property. Why do you say it is rented?</p>
<p>甲: Don't you see that he often rubs his matches on the painted walls whenever he smokes a cigarette?</p>
<p>Nun (visiting a prisoner in prison): Poor man, do you have anything you want me to entrust?</p>
<p>Prisoner: Madam, thank you. Please tell the mayor that I am allowed to be a free man in this city.</p>
<p>甲: The post office is really outrageous now and must be thoroughly reformed.</p>
<p>乙: What's the matter?</p>
<p>甲: A month ago, I sent out thirty registered letters urging people to pay their debts. For a month, no one came to pay. The day before yesterday, I sent my accountant to collect them, and they all said they had not received the letters.</p>
<p>If you can win the laughter of the whole audience, then the goodwill of both sides is already seen, and the listeners will not indifferently ignore the words that follow. At first, the teacher himself said that his relationship with Minli was quite deep, saying that he had served as a teacher in Minli Girls' Middle School, and the principals of the boys' and girls' middle schools were siblings, so the students of the two schools could also be said to be siblings, and he and the teachers of the boys' middle school could be called siblings. As soon as these words came out, there was a roar of laughter from the audience. Who would be willing to be called a "sister" by a tall and mighty man?</p>
<p>Farmers, Workers, Businessmen, Scholars, and Family Affairs: The teacher said that the nature of occupations has always been divided into five categories: farmers, workers, businessmen, scholars, and soldiers. However, soldiers cannot be called an occupation, but the category of family affairs can. He gave an example: the wife of Dr. Liu Zhanen, the president of Shanghai Jiang University, once jokingly asked Dr. Liu for a salary. When asked why, she said, "Although I am said to be serving the family and doing all kinds of housework, if I hired someone to do this job, I would have to pay them. Now that I am doing it myself, I should also be paid like a hired worker." The teacher also said, "Although I don't know if the lady actually asked Dr. Liu for a salary, if you think about it carefully, the reasoning is correct." So he changed the classification of occupations to farmers, workers, businessmen, scholars, and family affairs.</p>
<p>New Industries Produce Top Talents: The teacher also said that people often hesitate when choosing a career, but in my opinion, regardless of the level of the occupation, as long as the practitioner works hard, he can eventually achieve the common saying that every industry produces top talents. Mr. Yang Sisheng, the founder of Pudong Middle School, was originally a carpenter. After some time, he was able to establish a school and revitalize education, which was praised by everyone, so he can be called a "carpenter's champion." Mr. Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, originally set up a tofu shop, so he can be called a "tofu champion." His words were very interesting. Before long, the bell rang, and the teacher hurriedly finished his speech amidst applause and stepped down with a smile. The teachers all said that the teacher's fat physique and humorous interludes, and his words were quite close to the Shanghai dialect, which was better than those speakers who forced themselves to use an impure Mandarin, which was grating to the ear, so the interest was increased. Since the establishment of our school, there has never been a better speaker.</p>
<h3 id="e189">One-Day Trip to Liuhang - Xu Xinqin <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of the 27th of the month, Zhu Qizhan sent invitations to Shanghai friends, including the Ji Yuan couple, Di Lang, Xiao Yun, Chen Bo, Yan Ren, Yu Liang, Qi Jing, Cheng Bo, and Song Xian, to gather at the Letian Painting Studio in the Liuhang countryside to bid farewell to Wang Ziji Yuan Zu on the completion of his new house. The green and red colors are still fresh. After reviewing the past events, I casually wrote this record of the trip. Liuhang is located in the northeast of Taicang, namely Liujiakou, which is where the Loujiang River enters the sea. Liu is Lou. We traveled by motorcycle for about an hour to reach the destination. Having been trapped in the dusty city for a long time, we were refreshed by the clear air and bright spirits of the countryside. Entering through a winding path, we found the painting studio surrounded by flowers and trees. The peonies were fading, and the pomegranate flowers were about to bloom. After a short rest, we took a path to visit the nursery and the girls' primary school. We toured the Loujiang Bridge and the Yifang Garden, enjoying the pleasure of sightseeing. Then, Zhu Zixiang treated us with fine dishes and delicacies, accompanied by freshly picked bamboo shoots, which increased our appetite. Ji Yuanzi spread out paper to write and record the event, and all those present signed their names and added their seals. After drinking, Chen Bo's painting inspiration soared, and he painted a huge rock. Ji Yuan decorated it with peonies. Then, Qi Jing made a butterfly and a small mandarin duck, and Tuo Songxian painted daylilies. I saw that the cat's eyes were blurred and sleepy, so I placed an ox on top of it to tease it. Yan Ren hid the flower buds behind the stones, and Yu Liang added small stones to cover the roots. Then, Ji Yuan added color and eyebrows and the painting was completed. Zhu Zi also placed periwinkles between the small stones, adding more beauty. Song Xian, Xiao Jian, Cheng Bo, and I were not satisfied, so we spared no expense in providing paper and ink for scribbling and painting more than ten pieces. Everyone gained something, and the setting sun was already hanging between the red railings and green curtains. Then, we thanked him and said goodbye, singing loudly on the way back in the twilight. I don't know how late it was.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Brief Knowledge of Cherries - Tian Xuwo Sheng <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Cherries are of a hot nature. If children eat too many, they will all get heat. If ordinary people eat too many, they will bleed from the nose. However, the custom in Hangzhou is to feed children with cherries on the Lixia (Beginning of Summer) festival. I didn't know what it meant at first. Recently, Shanghai has been widely reporting cases of meningitis. After careful examination of the symptoms, it is actually what we call "measles" in Hangzhou, which is also called "zhen" in traditional Chinese medicine, and also called "ma." People in Shanghai call it "shazi," which is similar to smallpox but different in the disease. Smallpox is a yin poison, while this is a yang poison. When a person is first born, the poison inherited in the womb must be released once, so these two diseases are unavoidable for everyone. However, if it is accumulated not deeply in childhood, it is easy to let it out. If it reaches adulthood, it is often mixed with colds and easily mistaken for a warming medicine. Because its initial stage is a severe fever, like typhoid or heatstroke, but if it is treated with cooling medicine, it will close off the symptoms and result in death. If Western medicine is used to reduce inflammation or induce diarrhea, such as antipyretic ice or magnesium sulfate, the heat poison will sink into the stomach and intestines, resulting in starvation and dysentery, which cannot be saved. This happens often. Cherries mainly release internal heat. If people with wind disease or fever eat them, they will develop immediately. The antidote is to squeeze green sugar cane juice and drink it. Therefore, Wang Wei's cherry poem says, "If you eat your fill, you don't have to worry about internal heat; it is best to have sugar cane juice to cool it." In ancient times, people had to investigate the principles of things and know everything, just like Dongpo eating chestnuts. In the past, the lantern fires on the Shangyuan Festival and the kites on the Qingming Festival were all for children to look up and release internal heat. Lixia is the time when yang qi is at its peak. If it reaches the summer solstice, then one yin has already been born, and the yang qi will gradually recover and become difficult to release. Therefore, we want to use cherries to release the internal heat accumulated in the womb and release the yang poison received in the womb. There is a proven prescription for using four or five pounds of cherries, tightly stored in a porcelain bottle and buried in the soil. After two or three months, it will naturally turn into water. Take a cup of warm water to nourish the dying measles, which shows that eating cherries is precisely to promote the release of internal heat so that it will not accumulate and cause harm. In the Herbal Supplement, Huang Hairuo wrote about sugar cane, "For those with smallpox and measles that do not come out or for those with swollen, poisonous, and full bumps, it is advisable to squeeze green sugar cane juice and eat it frequently." Its cold-dispersing and detoxifying effect is greater than that of earthworms and pigeons. It is a pity that people do not know its function. From this point of view, the sugar cane in Du Fu's poem is even more credible in its profound understanding of things. Generally speaking, smallpox and measles should be released thoroughly, so cherries are used. After it has been released, then the heat should be cleared and detoxified, so sugar cane juice is used as its support. The above two formulas only have a one-sided view and are not as good as Du Fu's poem which combines medical principles. What is meant by "no need to worry" is precisely that you may as well eat your fill so that the internal heat can be fully released to the outside. And what is meant by "the chief officer still has" is because the cherries in the poem are given by the imperial family, and the chief officer is the official of the imperial kitchen, like today's Western chef or chief steward. Since the cherries are given to all the officials, then the officials dare not not eat their fill, and they worry that their internal heat will break out, so they say that there is still sugar cane juice in the imperial kitchen to clear the heat and detoxify. All those who receive the gifts must know that the poems of the ancients are not merely sighing but have deep meanings. It is not what people can dream of today. Cherries are currently on the market, and Tang poetry is perhaps not what people bother to read, so I especially record it.</p>
<p>Brief News: The Tianjin Butterfly Grand Theater, which has risen as a unique force, is magnificent in construction and is the crown of Tianjin. This time, it has specially invited Cheng Yushuang to perform, first showing a movie and then adding a play by Cheng. This is unprecedented and has attracted great attention from the people of the city. The performance of "Jade Hairpin" on the 19th and "The Golden Lock" the next night were sold out at three yuan per seat. Because the address is slightly off the beaten track, there is even more competition. The theater also has English advertisements and brochures. In total, Westerners account for about four-tenths of the audience each day, and they are particularly excited to hear Chinese opera. (Kong Wo)</p>

<p>Paris Cinemas</p>
<p>Patamount is the newest cinema building. It specializes in showing American Paramant films. Its magnificent architecture and new-style decoration are probably very popular in Paris. But its tickets are not very expensive. The cheapest is ten francs, so people of all ages like to go. It is also the earliest cinema in Paris to show sound films. Recently, it has added sound news films. I remember once, just after returning from Geneva, I saw in this place the sound films of the speeches of the dignitaries at last year's International League of Nations. At the beginning, an old man with a hunched back and white beard walked onto the stage, rubbing his fists and clapping the table, speaking in a clear and loud French. This was the French Foreign Minister Briand. After a long time, British Prime Minister MacDonald took the stage. His eyes looked at the audience like a lion's, and he said in English with a throaty voice, full of spirit. When he was happy, he would raise both hands and even dance. Next was the late German Foreign Minister Stresemann. He was very fat, and he seemed to say a few concise and decisive words, even clenching his teeth. The audience applauded. The rest was no longer shown. I was very strange. Probably people should help themselves before others can help them. You must first have the ability before you can win people's sympathy. At that time, I felt that these were all glorious people. I thought, why don't I go on stage, dance, and open my throat to speak loudly in fluent Mandarin? However, I will never have anything to do with politics.</p>
<p>Gaumant Palace is the largest cinema in Europe, with a capacity of 5,000 people. It is a remodeled racecourse. Although the equipment is old-fashioned, it is extremely magnificent. After each film is shown, there are always several scenes of dancing, and the background and electric lights are also very ingenious. Especially their orchestra is the most famous musician in Paris, probably more than eighty people.</p>
<p>Recently, several new cinemas have been created entirely to adapt to the new art movement. The most famous of these is OcildePariso, which can be translated as the Eye of Paris. The venue is extremely small, with a capacity of only about 300 people. The decoration inside is really so new that it is a bit thorough. The walls on both sides are painted with futuristic murals, which look like the paintings drawn by children. They are purely expressed with lines, very happy, free, and unrestrained. The naked goddess they painted has one leg thicker than her body. The ground and the surrounding background are all drawn according to the power of the lines, with bold perspective. Here, I was once again reminded of the expression methods of Chinese painting. The films he shows are mostly philosophical and scientific, as well as propaganda for various new arts of Cubism and Futurism, unlike ordinary cinemas that specialize in showing love, detective, and humorous dramas that cater to the general psychology.</p>
<p>Originally, the value of movies is increasing day by day. First, because it is an art that breaks time and space. Second, because it is the most universal entertainment in life. Third, because it is the twin of modern science and modern art. Therefore, people in the modern French literary world often discuss this issue, because it is not only to use it to promote a certain doctrine or policy, such as Red Russia's promotion of world revolution and the United States' promotion of prohibition, but not only for merchants to get rich by relying on it, but it has become a collaborative experimental laboratory for philosophers, scientists, artists, and various cultural representatives. Originally, art belongs to the masses, and at the same time, it guides the masses to make humanity move towards the highest purpose and return to the inner self-fulfillment. The ideal of modern film art lies in this.</p>

<h3 id="e192">Financial Markets: The Gold Market in the Past Two Days <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>One-Day Sudden Jump of Four Taels: The Gold Market on May 1st Escaped Its Mediocre State of the Past Few Days, Suddenly Climbing to the Main Peak, Which Was Truly Unexpected. The Reason, According to Analyses, Was That the Large Silver Bars Had Been Unmoving for Days. By the Day Before Yesterday, They Had Already Shown Signs of Shrinking, and More So Because Some Short Sellers Suddenly Increased Their Positions to Cover, While Long Positions Added to Their Bets. People's Hearts Immediately Felt Auspicious. Foreign Exchange Rates Tightened. The Afternoon Quotes Had Already Been Reduced by Half a Fraction. Banks Were Quite Willing to Sell. The Opening Price for June Gold Was 501.7 Taels. In the Afternoon, 3.6 Taels.

<p>Yesterday's Market Was Unpredictable: Yesterday (May 2nd), the Attitude of the Gold Market Was Quite Unpredictable, and Foreign Exchange Suddenly Showed an Uncertain Undercurrent. Compared to the Previous Session, There Were Several Taels of Discrepancies. Dealers Bought and Sold Differently. Taixing, Fuchang, Wanxing, Etc., Tended to Sell. Yuansheng, Xinhong, Etc., All Seemed to Be Pursuing Advances. Initially, the Market Price Opened Low Due to a Slight Shrinkage in the Silver Price. However, After the Buyers Had Shown Their Courage, the Exchange Rates Strengthened, and It Jumped Up Three Taels and More. Later, Yuansheng, Shunli, Etc., All Advanced, While Taixing, Xiangyu, and Fuchang Still Sold.

People's Hearts Suddenly Turned Bullish, So the Price Suddenly Rose by Three Taels. By Noon, It Was Even Higher, Reaching 7.3 Taels. At the Closing, There Was Almost a Sense of Daily Progress. The Announced Price Was Still 515.4 Taels, a Decrease of Eleven Taels to Eight Taels and More.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Surge Eventually Collapsed: The Afternoon Market Opened at 507.4 Taels. Then, It Was Heard That Xinhong, Etc., Were Covering Their Positions. The Indian Exchange Rate Showed a Decrease. Dealers Expected the Foreign Exchange Rate to Shrink Further, So It Was Driven Up by More Than One Tael, Reaching 508.8 Taels. At 2:30 PM, the Foreign Exchange Rate Did Not Show a Decrease, and Large Traders Tended to Sell. People's Hearts Were Crushed, So June British Gold Initially Closed at 11 Pence, Later at 11 Pence 0625.

Recent Japanese Gold Could Be Settled at 1.06125. Far-Term at 1.05. The British, American, and Indian Exchange Rates Were Still Peaceful. However, the Selling Pressure in the Market Seemed Strong, So There Was a Latent Softening Trend. At 4:30 PM Closing, It Was 505.7 Taels, A Slight Increase of Five Qian Compared to One Day.</p>

<p>The Yarn Market Was Flat and Weak on the 1st. The Front Market Was Still Flat Because American Cotton Rose, and the Number of Sellers Decreased. By the Afternoon, the News That Three-Grade Yarn Had Plummeted Greatly Depressed People's Hearts, and the Market Turned Soft. As a Result, It Decreased Slightly by 2-3 Qian Compared to the 30th. The Transaction Volume Was 8,150 Bales. The Current Yarn Was Also Cleared. The Buying Volume of Various Groups for the Entire Day Was Only 900 Bales. The Price Fell by 2.5 Qian. Yesterday's Yarn Market Was Extremely Dispersed. People's Hearts Softened. The Rise and Fall Were Very Small. The Transactions in the Market Were Dull. The Fluctuations Did Not Exceed One or Two Taels. There Were Many Empty Bids in the Distant Months. Scattered Households Saw This Kind of Lifeless Situation and All Folded Their Hands and Watched. The Attitudes of Both Long and Short Sides Remained Strong, Without Any Action. Most Psychologies in the Business Community Were That the Situation Was Unstable, Current Sales Were Stagnant, and Everyone Was Bearish. However, the Low Price Was Relatively Small, So It Was Not Easy to Fall Greatly at Once.</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Marked Yarn Were Slight. The Opening of the Early Market Before the Human Mark Was Flat. Scattered Households Watched Small, But There Were Fewer New Bidding Households in the Market, and Transactions Were Very Few. As a Result, This Month Rose by 4 Qian, and the Distant Month Rose by 1-2 Qian. In the Afternoon, the Situation Was Still Dispersed. Furthermore, the News of the Labor Strike Was Relatively Moderate. The Price of Three-Grade Yarn in Osaka Tended to Fall, and Sentiment Was Even Softer. This Month Fell by 4 Qian, and the Distant Month Fell by 1-2 Qian. The Full-Day Transaction Statistics Were 4,350 Bales. The Closing Price of the Human Mark Is Recorded on the Left.</p>

<p>The No. 1 Cotton Market was already calm early on. Because American cotton rose, a certain large household sold off large quantities in the near month. As a result, it only rose 5 Qian. The transaction statistics were 17,900 Dan. Only Puyi Factory Entered 200 Bales of Nanshi Cotton. The price was 34.5 Taels. Up to the 2nd, it was still Quietly Settled. The Tendency Is Slightly Soft. It Is Generally the Case That American Cotton Saw Mixed Rises and Falls. The Sales of Current Cotton in the Market Were Quiet. Some Scattered Households Were Bearish, But the Sources From Various Routes Were Diminishing. The Han Gang’s Arrivals Were Becoming Increasingly Rare Due to the Rampancy of Bandits in the Hubei Territory. The Current Cotton Transactions Were All Reported to Have Stopped.</p>
<p>The Han Mark’s Front Market Opened because American cotton had recently risen, so the Human Chlorine Gas Was Still Good. Each Month Was Flat At Two or Three Disks, Floating Households Settled, and Then Fell. As a Result, the Near Fell 5 Points and the Far Was Flat. In the Afternoon, the Trend Was Still Thin. Each Month Fell 5 Points. The Full-Day Transaction Statistics Were 11,000 Dan. The Closing Price of the Han Mark Is Recorded on the Left.</p>

<h3 id="e201">The River Downstream Rice Market Has Been Falling for Days <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>In the Last Two Days Before Yesterday, a Total of 20-Plus Sources Arrived in Zhabei. The Market Sales Were Dull and There Were Few Transactions. The Jiaobei Japonica Rice Has Been Falling Back for Days. High-Priced Goods Have Also Shown a Softening Trend. However, the Zhenzhen Special Top Still Requires 21 Yuan. In the Last Two Days, Ordinary Japonica Rice Has Fallen by About One or Two Jiao, While Second-Grade Japonica Rice, Although It Is Short of Two or Three Jiao, Still Has No Main Consultants. The Trend in Tianjin Is Extremely Dull. Rice Has Also Turned Downstream and the Market Price Has Seen Tiredness. The Arrival of Horned Half and Pointed Du Is Rarely Seen. The Poor Quality of Foreign Rice Causes It to Feel Flat and Tired. The Great Price Has Been Slightly Reduced. The Sales of White Yuan Are Increasingly Stagnant. The Reason Why the Price of This Kind of Yuan Rice Is Too High Is That The Cost Is Not Affordable. The Intention to Enter Is Dull So the Market Is Soft.</p>
<p>Ten or So Ships Arrived Downstream in the South of Shanghai. The Purchase Atmosphere in the Main Street Was Thin. The Changbang Jiaobei Japonica Rice Fell Back Along With the City Because It Was Wrapped Up in the Road Reported Shen Sales Were Dull and Slack. The Highs and Seconds Were Short of Corners. In Addition, the Jiangsu Tong White Japonica Rice Initially Stood Firm Due To Its Rare Arrival, But Then It Became Tired Due To Stagnant Sales. The Prices Have Become Tired by One Half. The Transactions in Nanbang's Green Horn and Other Sparse Early Rice Were Especially Thin. Although the Customer Gang Slightly Purchases, It Picks and Chooses Price Cut About One Jiao. The Turnover of Horned Du Each Point Has Been Limited. There Were Only South Bang Goods to Be Seen Upon Arrival, and the Large Disk Also Felt Slightly Soft. The Circulation of Hidden Yuan Continued to See Downstream Is Really Because the Sales Were Stagnant and There Was No Hope of Turning Around.</p>
<h3 id="e202">The Noodles and Wheat Are Consistently Downstream <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>The Sentiment of the Bulls in the Noodle Market Softened. On the 1st, the Noodle Market was Still Flat in all Months. Because the Weather Was Sometimes Sunny and Sometimes Rainy, Both the Assigning and Receiving Parties Inevitably Observed. Therefore, the Prices in May and June were Just 7 Li and a Half Smaller Than the Prices in the Previous Month, and the Prices in July, August, and September were 2 Li and a Half Smaller. By Yesterday, the Both Morning and Afternoon Markets Both Showed Plunges. The Only Impulse in This Case is Caused by The Fact That The Multi-Heads in General Saw That the Outcome of the Previous Months Was Not Good, Deeply Afraid that the Results of this Month Would Suffer the Same Blow, So The Xibang, Which Has the Greatest Influence, Also Shook in Its Bearishness. In addition, a certain large factory has also stated that the environment is not good, and it still absorbs on the surface, but it has been gradually throwing out in secret, and its quantity is more than the temporary absorption, causing the air on the market to suddenly appear bleak, and it is unexpected that there are a large number of throws and pressures regardless of how near or far, so it is unexpectedly falling step by step. However, although the factory and the floating are throwing a lot, the Jinbang is buying, and the quotation is 3 yuan and 7 corners, which is good because the local inventory is gradually being sold, and 40,000 to 50,000 bags are needed, so the demand for Shen Noodles may have to be transferred to Yin, and the follow-up may be a slight turnaround due to this reason. In total, the Drop Degree on the 1st Compared to the End of the Previous Month, the Value in May Is Just 3 Minutes and 2 Li and a Half, The Value in June Is Just 2 Minutes and 2 Li and a Half, The Values in July, August, and September Are 2 Minutes, the Values in October Have Also Been Imitationly Opened and Photographed, and the Initial Price Is 5 Taels, 2 Qian, and 2 Fens, and Then There Is A Slight Loss of a Split</p>
<p>The Term Wheat Is Softened By The Noodle Market. Over the Past Two Days, the Trend of the Term Wheat Market Has Been Generally Tired, But The Inner-Earth Gang Sentiment Has Been Very Firm, So Although the Environment is Not as Good as Before, the Fall in the Market Is Still a Little Short. However, If the Market for Noodles Is Like This The Wheat Market Will Be Hard To Change in the Future The Price of Current Wheat Has Also Fallen by 1 Qian From the Previous Day If So the Standard Can't Stand. As A Result, the Values in June are 2 Minutes Smaller Than the End of the Previous Month the Values in July are Just 2 Minutes and Eighth of a cent Smaller August Doesn't Move September The Values in Are 2 Minutes Smaller The Prices in the Current Wheat Market Are Open as Expected at the End of the Previous Month Since the Brokers are Charged a Commission, it is A Clear Sign That It Is Pushed Down. There Are over 3,000 Bags of Xuzhou Wheat, Suzhou Wheat, Qingjiangpu Wheat, and Bengbu Wheat at 4 Taels and 9 Qian, and Special High-Class Henan Wheat at 4 Taels, 9 Qian, and 3 Fens Were Handled by Fuxin Shenda.</p>

<p>Overseas Silk Prices Plummeted The Market Became Increasingly Quiet</p>
<p>Yesterday, The Overseas Silk Prices Plummeted. Overseas Silk Prices Plummeted. There Was A Sharp Change in the Foreign Village Silk Market in This City Again. When the Villages Received News of the Sharp Plunge in Overseas Silk Prices, the Market Atmosphere Suddenly Became Quiet. European and American Silk Weavers Didn't Need it and the Progress of Appetite Was Stagnant. The Factories in Xinshunzhong Originally Quoted Only 960 Taels and No One Dumped. Stocks of Old Silk Have Also Fallen to Around 1,000 Taels. The Losses of Silk in All of the Factories Were Too Great, and All of them Stopped dumping, and also sent Telegrams to the Mulberry Region to Keep An Eye Out for the Overuse of the Mulberry Prices to Avoid Suffering Losses. The Extreme Depression of the Silk Market Is Actually A Phenomenon that Has Not Happened in More Than 10 Years.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Silkworm Business in Jiahu Has Lost Some Color <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Purely Affected by The Disaster and The Weather</p>
<p>Jiaxing and Huzhou Are All Regions of Silkworm Silk, and Farmers All Regard Sericulture as An Important Sideline. This Year, The Counties Have Been Affected by Bandits, and Farmers With A Little Money Have Not Dared to Live Peacefully in the Countryside. Households With Insufficient Financial Resources Have Nowhere to Borrow Silkworm Capital, and It Has Been Difficult to Increase the New Silkworm Quota. The Silk Merchants and Silk Merchants Have Not Dared to Carry Money to Collect Mulberry From the Cocoon Lines Far Away From the City and Along the Lake, So It Is Still Uncommon to Rent Now. The Early Silkworms in All Regions Have Opened Leaves With Three Sleep for Many Days, and the Late Gang Is Still Only Three Sleep. In Addition, the Climate Is Cold and Warm, and There Is Endless Rain. The Silkworm Market Is Quite Affected. This Year, the Spring Silkworms in the Two Regions of Jiahu Will Inevitably Be Affected.</p>

It Has Been Found That This Treasure Eyebrow Has 37 Items, Which Belong To Two-Amount Selling Prices, Which Are 89 Taels and 91 Taels. It is More Than Ten Taels Lower Than Last Year. The Foreign Merchants搶辦争先恐後 It Is Hard to Give a Positive Opinion on the Future of the Tea Market Because There Were Many Foreign Merchants Looking at it When the New Tea Was Launched Last Year.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Piece Goods Market: Tianjin Dealers Vigorously Buying <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Our factory's cotton cloth market saw weakness yesterday. Fine cloths experienced a slight decrease of two to two and a half [units], while coarse cloths dropped by five cents.

Since the use of machine power, that is, the machine is directed by human will, the national industrial life has undergone a change, but its effect is more than that. In the era of machine evolution, our minds only pay attention to the commercial value and forget the psychological and spiritual beauty. The transportation tools we have today can shorten the journey and enable trade to realize its impact on us is also very obvious. President Hoover often uses the word "removing cheap labor" and spares no effort to support the plan to remove the burden from our shoulders. This kind of burden can really hinder mankind's pursuit of a higher spiritual life, so the invention of cheap military vehicles is more powerful for increasing the living standards of the people in the country than anything else. The use of automobiles can gather people from all walks of life in one place and unite them, whether they are workers in industrial areas, farmers in the fields, or merchants from various provinces. Therefore, from our perspective, the automobile is indeed a positive driving force for the evolution of civilization. This last effect is not only the most powerful element in our evolution, but the way to obtain this effect and its direct effect are extremely magnificent. The beauty is not entirely in the car itself, but the manufacturing method is worthy of much attention. Countless workers in the Ford factory manufacture Ford cars with their real work, which is truly an ideal expression. It not only manufactures huge machines and millions of horsepower, but also can manufacture this kind of cheap transportation tool for us, so that people living in this world can enjoy the pleasure of life. Its contribution is also great.</p>
