<h3>遠東會中華失敗原因</h3>
<p>足球隊陣線不甚整齊籃球隊亦不聨絡田徑選手大出力棒球游泳日本素專長｜中華隊要人之談話｜（錢華）　　此次遠東運動大會我國可謂完全失敗田徑賽之全軍覆没本爲意中事蓋無論矣其餘若曾握七届遠東覇權之足球此次竟與日本戰成平局保留錦標全國注目之平津籃球此次竟連載皆北一蹶不振退居末席出於一般人意料之外雖僥倖奪得亞軍然就實力言殊不能與菲列濱分庭抗禮苟不自奮勉全國一致力圖雪恥則遠東大會中將永遠無我國位置記者此次奉派參與盛會目嗜失敗之慘狀痛定思痛曾歷訪我國各敎練詢以失敗原因及對於日菲兩國實力之意見分叚介紹於下或亦足供我國人士之借鏡而知所以自勉也（一）田徑賽馬</p>
<h3>馬約翰意見</h3>
<p>關於田徑賽一項日本進步之速實足令人驚異欽佩素以短跑見長之菲島選手此次亦被日人打倒且如撑竿跳跌遠等紀錄均已與世界成績相接近我國烏合之軍未有時日之訓練其失敗也固宜記者曾訪唔田徑賽總教練馬約翰君叩以意見擄云自一九二七年以來日本朝野猛力練習臥薪藏胆艱苦卓絶始有今日之成績我國欲以僥倖取勝寗有是理但大會中我國選手之成績均打破其本人國内之紀錄足以證明奮鬥精神此點堪足自慰且李仲三君之跳高司徒光君之三級跳遠趙汝功君之跳遠曹裕君之撑竿跳等僅有月餘在滬之正式訓練李仲三由一米七○增至一米八○司徒光增至十三米七○其餘若麥國珍之四百米成績至五十一秒五分三均有突異之進步可知中國非無天才無良好之教練以科學的方法作繼續不斷的練習耳深信茲後苟能注重此點力加奮勉四年後雖不能即謂奪得日本之覇權但獲得相當之位置可斷言也倘一如從前急來抱佛脚之態度有運動會始去練習則田徑賽之繼續保持零分當無疑義（二）足球</p>
<h3>李惠堂言論</h3>
<p>此次中國足籃球之失敗一般均歸罪於日要裁判之不公但記者以爲日本技術之進步與夫我國之退化實爲最大原因裁判云云究非致命傷也足球健將李惠堂氏此次因病足未參加此賽記者與之同輪返滬暢談甚久李氏云此次我國足球隊之表演確不十分佳妙前鋒缺乏連絡且少一個領隊人才故如一盤散沙失去攻敵機會中日足球决賽中幸内衛有李天生守門有周賢言否則定要多輸幾個日本隊對於奔跑及脚頭確有非常的進步前鋒連絡亦佳惜對於足球之内部精妙神髓尚未能十分領會故於攻門時即露弱點不易中的余確信茲後中國隊陣線倘稍加整齊勝之殊爲易易李氏言時頗有把握吾人其拭目以俟四年後之今日可也（三）籃球</p>
<h3>董守義談話</h3>
<p>我國籃球隊四戰四北成績之惡確出於國内人士想像之外記者在日時曾以詢該隊教練董君守義據謂該隊失敗第一原因即交戰時過爲興奮毫無鎭靜工夫求勝心過切稍負數球即拼命反攻致陣線凌亂與敵以可乘之機會四次比賽均是如此於是影響於合作之傳遞及擲籃之準確縱觀我隊之表演不及在杭州時十分之六焉得不敗第二原因即國内揄揚過高全隊自深極甚不料第一次即受挫於日因責任心關係求勝心過切簡接的遂陷於十分興奮地位不克補救第三即爲裁判之不公問題余迭觀中日菲籃球賽渠對於日方之（行走）毫不處罰對中菲兩方則監視極嚴日方因此而得分者不一而足且因我隊之無鎭靜工夫上塲數次受罰即大慌張特慌張中敵狡計而不自覺惜哉反之菲人方面能深自鎭定均能於最后反敗爲勝第就本届實力而言菲島自屬最佳中日技藝互有優長定謂中不如日非確論也（四）其他</p>
<h3>徐振東之語</h3>
<p>棒球爲日本之國技雖三尺之童亦知遊戲其勝也固宜至若游泳亦以環境關係我國尚在極幼稚時代殊無競爭之可言記者曾與徐振東君談中日之網球徐謂日人之網球怕軟不怕硬故林寳華不如邱飛海林邱之雙打本有獲勝之可能惜天不助我最后一擊已出界線不幸中林之胸遂告失敗日本網球人才極多有競爭之機會故球藝易於進步反之若林邱之所在地對手極少進步自較困難將來遠東網球一項中國頗少機會也粤一女師排球隊</p>

<p>戀愛成熟時。所得愉快而甜蜜的生活。抵不過中途變卦時悲傷而凄凉的意味　　情塲失敗的痛苦。比甚麽事業的受挫爲甚。　　任你十分有把握的男子。不能必女子永遠不愛别人。反之女子之於男子亦然。　　天文家能測量行星之距離。不能測量人心之高下。　　誰都知道金錢爲身外物但仍很多不顧性命般去鑽謀的人。　　男子以女子之容貌美麗爲戀愛方針。女子以男子之金錢富有爲交換條件。　　女子的一雙襪要值二十餘元。怪不得一擔米。也要值二十餘元了。　　君子之交淡如水。愈淡愈能持久。男女之愛濃如酒。壏濃越難醒悟。　　一個人如其不知儲蓄。他的智識。連蜜蜂還不如。　　青年男女之沉溺於情場或賭窟。其禍不减於蜻蜒之投蛛網。飛蛾之撲燈火。一樣有喪身的可能。　　婦人越妒越貞。因爲伊心裏只有你一人可愛。所以也不許你愛别的女子。　　愛情爲青年之私有物。當然不能放棄。也不能濫用。　　一切事情。如其太認眞了。固多煩惱。但是太達觀了。亦無興趣。所以太蠢笨或太聰敏的人。其苦處比甚麽人也深切。</p>
<h3>記阮文達驅逐外國兵船事</h3>
<p>覺迷前清嘉慶之末。道光之初。儀徴阮文達。實督兩廣。文達以嚴馭外商洋商爲務。蓋洋商實受外商之利益。外商則仗洋商之庇護。職是之故。外商洋商。傲黠不馴文達遇事。每裁抑之。其時有英船在黄浦。因與民人爭水。竟用鳥槍。擊死民人。文達嚴飭洋商。必得兇犯。方登船。而兇犯即拔刀自刎死。此一事也。又一法人。嘗打死一民婦。文達立獲兇犯。照例絞决抵罪。此又一事也。此俱嘉慶二十二年初督兩廣時事。其後道光初年。英國護貨之兵船。在伶仃山。用槍擊死小民二人。文達立飭洋商向英國大班勒取兇手。蓋其時英國但有大班管理貿易事務。未設領事也。大班詭言。只管貿易事務。兵船則有兵頭。職分較大。我令不能行於彼也。文達旋飭傳諭兵頭。兵頭復詭稱彼亦有被民毆傷將死者多人。欲以相抵。文達察得其詭。則又傳諭大班。如不獻出兇手。即行封艙。停止貿易。大班又稱。實不能獻出兇手。無可如何。情願停止貿易。其時捕船亦已詭避在外洋將匝月矣。而文達持之益堅。大班乃率各外商。齊下黄浦大船。禀稱無可如何。只好全帮回國。不做買賣。文達即發印諭。言爾願回即回。我朝中並不重爾等貨税也。於是英國大貨船二十餘號。收拾篷桅。作出口之勢。仍上禀云。大人旣許回國。何以砲臺之上。又設兵砲。達又加印諭云。虎門砲臺。本是終年常設。並非此時待爾等出</p>

<h3>難劇運動尚有一天</h3>
<p>辛酉劇團舉行難劇運動於上月三十一日演（文舅舅）昨日演（狗的跳舞）成績非常圓滿舞臺技術固不少勝人之處尤以演員神情口吻咸臻絶頂如袁牧之君可謂一時無兩潔榮顧震兩女土王遐文君亦復勝任愉快今日爲最後一天爲名劇（桃花源）原作者武者小路實篤氏享名已久演出者朱穰丞氏亦煞費苦心聞入座劵由内山書店售去不少可見旅滬日本人士對於武者小路氏朱氏之崇拜矣　　狗的跳舞中的翟漢禮（袁牧之飾）</p>
<h3>（文舅舅）的舞臺技術草陰</h3>
<p>在沉悶了好久而現正在興奮着的我國戲劇界辛酉劇團的（文舅舅）（ＵncleＶauya）竟然接連的在中央大會堂公演了兩次我是愛好戲劇的｜｜尤其對於這一類的戲劇｜｜所以在他們兩次公演的觀衆當中總少不了我一個　　不過我雖然是愛好戲劇但是對於戲劇却是個門外漢所以對於演員的表情技術究竟是好是壞我不敢妄加一辭不過對於他們的舞臺技術方面我却有幾句話要説　　（一）佈景我們曉得一齣戲做得好演員固我是重要同時佈景的逼眞也是其中的一個成分（文舅舅）是一齣四幕戲所以同時有四幕不同的佈景我最歡喜的就是第一幕在一個安靜的鄉下一所破舊的茅屋前面還長着兩株樹屋的對面是一座小小的園子一片青蔥着實是可愛坐在臺下的我在看得出神的時候竟然忘掉我是坐在位置上而好像是身入其境佈景能弄到這樣我眞要説一句（嘆觀止焉其餘像第二幕的食堂第三幕的客廳和第四幕的辦公室都能夠使人看了尋不出破綻來這實在是難能可貴　　（二）音樂音樂在戲劇裏面是一件很大的帮助牠能在沉悶的戲裏提起觀衆的精神和興趣（文舅舅）是一齣感傷的戲劇在全劇裏面找不出一點能使觀衆感着興趣的地方假使没有那優美的音樂來調劑憂鬱的空氣我恐怕觀衆不見得會能安安穏穏地維持到散戲不過他們的音樂實在太好了｜｜我並不是看見譚抒眞朱希聖余約章幾位音樂家才這樣説｜｜當那婉轉而柔和的音調幽揚地送到我耳朶裏時老實説一句我眞是（爲之神往）了　　（三）道具在戲的工作裏道具是一件最繁的事情要弄得（有條不紊）（頭頭是道）是不容易的（文舅舅）戲裏的道具弄得雖然不見得怎麽特别好但是也不見得十分的壞不過一只Ｓamovar在第一幕裏就看見在第二幕裏也看見在第三幕裏又看見我不懂他們爲什麽要這樣的借重牠或者他們另外有什麽用意罷我可不曉得　　（四）化裝要想戲做得好演員個人的技術固然很重要可是假使没有好的化裝眞的精神不能完全表現辛酉的（文舅舅）我最滿意的就是化裝袁牧之的韋逸文（文舅舅）假使我預先不曉得的話我眞要以爲他是俄國人他的臉部的化裝他的服裝都是維妙維肖最奇怪的就是他脚上的一雙皮鞋也不是中國的式樣我恐怕他是從俄國的舊貨店買來的罷洪梅青的海蘭羅鳴鳳的史立三和唐遠藩的趙醫生化裝也都很像我可以總説一句他們化裝的本領已是達於（化境）了不過李媽的衣服在全劇四幕裏始終是這一身没有看她換過不曉得他們有什麽用意　　（五）燈光佈景雖然好假使没有適當的燈光來陪襯那也那也好像牡丹没有綠葉來扶持一樣的失去精采（文舅舅）是一幕外景三幕内景所以他們的燈光也就隨着戲的地位和時問而變更他們用着和諧而幽靜的光線來反映出自然界的美眞有（巧奪天工）之槪尤其在第二次公演的第三幕裏用ＳpotＬight射在墻上的太陽光假使我的智慧不從驚奇當中逃出來的話我眞要以爲眞的太陽光會照在墻上還有第二幕裏的電閃也是非常之像坐在我旁邊的一位七八歲的女孩子我親眼看見她在電閃一亮之後連忙用手去掩住她的小耳朶這一點可見他們在燈光上用的功夫了　　（六）效果效果對於劇情有很大的帮助牠能使得劇情格外的逼眞這是做戲當中一件不可或缺的東西（文舅舅）裏面的效果我也感着滿意像第一幕的鳥啼聲（也許是眞的鳥啼）第二幕的更析聲雷聲雨聲和風聲第三幕的槍聲和第四幕的馬鈴聲使人聽了總想不到是人做出來的不過有時雷聲嫌太急些槍聲發出雙響有點美中不足可是對於全體却没什麽大妨碍　　要説的話旣然已經説完那末不得不收束不過最後我要向辛酉的人説一句你們這次的公演可以説是已經成功你們的精神你們的毅力是值得稱佩和讚美的你們的責任不僅是在你們自身的成功你們要負着改良現代的戲劇和發展現代的戲劇的擔子你們的前途是光明的那末辛酉的團員們你們不要（故步自封）你們還要向着你們光明的前程努力努力</p>
<h3>南宫生活的片段ＣＡ</h3>
<p>常常在本欄上看見東宫裏宫主們的優美生活又常聽見西宫裏宫主們的歡樂愉快僻處在眞茹鎭的曁南大學因此便没人注意了　　宫以南名一則她們都從南區來是南方的佳人二則校名是曁南大學她們所居的宫當然是南宫了　　南宫的宫主們因爲十分之八是從海外歸來的所以她們種種的生活有不同人處内地的小姐們雖也佔了百分之一二十但是耳濡目染一入深宫便被環境所軟化了　　她們有的是果敢義勇的精神同時也有强健活潑的體格别説海上宫中的宫主不能望其項背便是江南的健兒較量起來也將退避三舍她們在晨曦初上的清晨穿着長僅及後脛的短統襪束着短掩膝頭的薄羅裙露了大半截醬色的小腿手裏拿着網球拍或籃球一直衝到操塲上其勢洶洶倘使這時候迎面碰着一位東宫或西宫的宫主包管你（撲通）一聲要不經意的推倒了　　她們在南宫中很安閒的住着每天起得很早鐘嗚六下全多離了床位因爲早</p>

<p>中華民國十九年六月八日（申報第二張）星期日（八）起的緣故睡眠也很早九點鐘後便一個一個到了黑甜鄉但也有爲了特别緣由睡得遲的如開夜車寫ＬoveＬetter之類　　最近在她們的宫中發現了兩樁事頗堪發噱前者是她們愛惜光陰的表現後者是她們謔浪笑傲的風趣現在寫在下面　　别開生面的謝客在某一號宫門口有這樣一張字條（自修時間謝絶來賓來賓請你自重面拒不雅）字寫得很大大槪是呌人特别注意的意思　　未名劇社在某一個早晨宫裏忽然發見一大張佈告式的宣言用紅藍兩種墨水寫成簪花楷書大意是説（我們爲了藝術爲了愛美爲了攫住青春爲了保存天眞組織此未名劇社希望同學們踴躍加入）下面大半張空白是寫加入者的芳名和宿舍號數所謂簽名處第二天早上那張鮮艷奪目的宣言依然貼着簽名處的名字却加增了不少大約她們是寫的爪哇·荷蘭·暹羅文的名姓吧看上去煞是有趣原來上寫着（有名無姓本校第二十宿舍）（無名氏本校第二十宿舍九十一號）（亞拉眞茹富翁别墅）再看那未名劇社的宣言下面寫着幾個蠅頭小楷（打倒風頭主義的未名劇社）</p>
<h3>忙煞了｜培成的女生｜</h3>
<p>木關於培成女生演（少奶奶的扇子）的事在本報上早就登載過了這裏所要説的是關於她們的（忙）現在她們的公演期｜十六十七兩天｜漸漸的逼近了所以她們忙得愈利害底下所説的三種忙雖然没有什麽意思但是却能表明出她們對藝術犧牲的精神我們不能不加以讚許的　　一·排演隨便那個劇團在公演前的幾天總要忙於排演的培成的女生們當然室一看你就可以發見演員們聚在一起的練習着下課了放學了可以她們仍舊的排演着甚至於她們犧牲了星期六的下午和星期日全天孜孜的做她們的戲劇工作這樣不斷的努力將來的成績當然是在我們意料之中　　二·製衣她們因爲劇中人的裝飾要十分時髦的緣故所以一個個都忙着裁製新衣費了數十金在所不惜我想以後的裁縫們也要燒香拜佛求小姐們發些慈悲多做幾幕戲呢　　三·售票這次她們公演的地點是在夏令配克影戲院因爲租金太貴的緣故她們的入塲券也漲到一元二元這也是不得已的辦法她們爲了要多銷入塲券所以東也兜售西也兜售忙得不亦樂乎</p>

<h3>中大將聘體育指導</h3>
<p>不久以前江大運動會開幕結果去年名列第四的中央大學一躍而居第一不消説同中央大學有關係的都要眉飛色舞就是社會一般人也都以爲這是體育界的好現象哩可是中央大學的當局和學生他們並不以爲滿足這次遠東運動會我國慘敗的消息傳到校後全校充滿的都是感嘆的空氣校長張乃燕博士鑒於這次的失敗並不是運動員不努力實由於平時没有良好的指導根本辦法祇有延請有資望的指導這一門但是校裏的經費入僅敷出指導員要想在體育落後的國裏找到可説難於登天要想從歐美請一個聲名赫赫的體育指導來的確是十分爲難的事但張校長並不因學校經濟支絀而放棄他的計劃而且因張校長的努力已快要實現了所擬請的聽説已决定麥克樂先生云（伯良）</p>
<h3>中央大學Prometheus社</h3>
<p>獻榮當中央大學未改組前而在南高東大的時候的確牠底學生們對於（發表欲）却有自謙的美德｜例如他們説（我們還没有成就我們没有可發表的東西也没有去發表的資格）但逮及現在中大旣從南高東大改組於是便來了一個大轉機這個生動的轉機把我們學校截然分成了兩個時代從前的那個時代是舊的現在的不消説是新時代的因爲新時代降臨的緣故所以牠底學生都無形之中變更其思想了就以（發表欲）而論從前是冷靜的現在是熱烈的因爲現在熱烈的緣故所以許多文藝社以及研究會（宗旨當然在研究及出版刊物）也應運而生Prometheus便是其中之一　　Ｐrometheus社爲吾校幾個同學組織的據説Prometheus是一個羅馬的火神該社以Prometheus取名就是表示該社社員對於烈火憶憬其精神將如烈火之眶猛如烈火之奔狂而力求破除今日一般社會所有的沉悶的現景呢又Ｐrometheus社去年上季曾借着中央日報副刊出版Ｐrometheus文學週刊數期但後因暑假社員星散以致社務暫行停頓現聞該社社員將重振旗鼓擴充社務内分社會科學及文藝兩部不日將發表宣言徴求社員呢</p>

<h3>Gandhi's Weaving Movement</h3>
<p>Among Gandhi's patriotic movements, the weaving movement is considered by some to be insignificant and not worthy of attention. However, I believe that it is an essential element of national salvation for countries where industry has not yet developed. Why? The most indispensable things in life are now said to be clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Food is indispensable but may depend on other countries. Housing and transportation, if they are to be exquisite and fast, may also require the assistance of others. However, when it comes to the most desperate times, living in thatched huts and traveling on foot is still possible. Only the old practice of weaving cloth at home has long been abandoned. If the cloth produced by the machines of the country cannot supply the entire country, then the import of foreign goods must inevitably be succumbed to. The right to necessities of all people is not controlled by oneself, not to mention the outflow of money related to a country's economy. If there is an obstacle, wouldn't it make the people of the country 無衣 sigh? Therefore, Gandhi's movement of everyone weaving cloth is truly a fundamental plan for countries with undeveloped industries. The reason why countries engage in commerce and trade with each other is to exchange the unique goods of each country. If a country cannot supply itself with the necessities of all people and also seeks to be supplied by others, then the qualification of national independence and unrestrainedness has long been 残缺. How can it obtain true freedom? Therefore, I believe that no matter how poor or weak a country is, its food, no matter how coarse, must be self-sufficient. Its clothing, no matter how crude, must be self-sufficient. When housing and transportation cannot be provided by others, one must naturally be content with crudeness and be able to provide for oneself. All other foreign goods can be purchased if there is power, or avoided if there is no power. Even if there is the oppression of economic power, it will not harm the foundation.

<h3>Serious Situation in India</h3>
<p>Northwest Border Xia Hua Attacked, Afridi People in Great Force, Bombay Police Surround Nationalist Party Headquarters, British Authorities Collect Evidence of Soviet Propaganda</p>
<p>National Society Dispatch, Bombay, 6th - The Afridi tribes are attacking North Xia Hua with increasing force. The British estimate the enemy strength to be 14,000, but only a portion are carrying rifles. British aircraft are currently bombing the enemy and their encampments. The enemy announced to the residents that their purpose is to avenge the Muslims recently shot by British troops in North Xia Hua. The enemy has blown up bridges and blocked roads to impede the advance of British armored vehicles. However, although the enemy is courageous in battle, they are no match for the superior British weaponry, so it is generally believed that it will be difficult for the enemy to drive straight in.</p>
<p>National Society Dispatch, London, 6th - Foreign Secretary Henderson announced in the House of Commons on Friday evening that the Indian government's report stated that the Soviets are taking advantage of the unrest in India to engage in propaganda, especially in the Northwest Border. The Foreign Secretary continued that the current authorities are collecting evidence for special agencies to review. If the agencies believe that this evidence warrants action against the Soviets, he intends to ask the House of Commons to relieve him of the responsibility of paying attention to Soviet propaganda or to agree to completely sever ties with the Soviets. After the Foreign Secretary's speech, the entire House of Commons stood and cheered.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Simla, 6th - Captain Fryer, his wife, and Colonel Farre were traveling in two cars on the road from Quetta to Chaman, not far from the border between India and Afghanistan. The cars were driven by Indians. In the middle of the journey, stones blocked the road, preventing the cars from proceeding. Ambushers suddenly appeared and kidnapped the people in the cars, taking them by camel across the border to a village about 20 miles from Chaman. When the military police heard the alarm, they rushed to rescue them, but the kidnapped people had already entered Afghan territory. It is reported that they are being treated well and their lives are safe. Local officials have taken Afghan soldiers to the village to negotiate. It is reported that the kidnappers are from the Achakzai tribe because some of their tribesmen residing in British territory have been detained by the British, so they took this retaliatory action.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Simla, 6th - The three kidnapped British people have now safely returned to Chaman.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, North Xia Hua, 6th - A large contingent of Afridi tribesmen from outside the border has entered North Xia Hua, planning to attack the military station, but because the local villagers are unwilling to cooperate, most of them retreated. They destroyed ditches, felled trees, and placed obstacles in the roads to prevent pursuing troops. British aircraft pursued them, and British troops also engaged those who had not retreated in battle all day. However, the terrain is treacherous, making it extremely difficult to drive them out of the territory. The British army suffered some casualties during the battle.</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, Bombay, 6th - Afridis are attacking North Xia Hua with considerable force. The British estimate the enemy strength to be about 14,000 men, but only a portion have rifles. British aircraft are currently attacking them. The Afridis told the residents that British troops had fired on and killed many Muslims in North Xia Hua, so they came to avenge them. River bridges have been demolished and main roads blocked to prevent British armored vehicles from scouting. British and Indian heavy troops are now concentrated in Para. It is heard that the Afridis are fighting desperately, but at present, it seems they are unable to advance.</p>

<h3>Temporary Obstacles Arise</h3>
<p>Secretary of State Refuses to Lend Negotiation Documents, Democrats Will Take an Aggressive Stance</p>
<p>National Society Dispatch, Washington, 6th - Secretary of State Stimson today refused to send all documents regarding the secret negotiations of the London Sea Conference to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, saying that his move was based on the direct order of President Hoover. According to a group of observant people, this turbulence will inevitably cause a political struggle on a large scale. The Democrats and reactionary Republicans will unite to launch a full-scale attack on this secret diplomacy stance. The passage of the Sea Treaty will also be greatly hindered by this unexpected setback. Stimson refused to give any explanation for the reason of the move, only saying that he had discussed it with the President and acted according to his orders. Shi later declared that those who suspected that there was a secret understanding in the Sea Conference were ignorant. Japanese Government</p>
<h3>Implements Austerity Policy</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's New Budget Draft Has Been Printed, and Many Parties Criticize It, Fearing That It Will Exacerbate Unemployment</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 7th - With administrative economization as its goal, the Ministry of Finance's draft implementation budget for Showa years 5 and 6 was printed yesterday and shown internally to the accounting section chiefs of each province. The content includes a reduction of 60 million yuan, a delay of more than 20 million yuan, for a total of more than 88 million yuan. It deducts 12.3% from the basic amount of approximately 700 million yuan from items such as object purchase fees, construction fees, and subsidy fees. The largest reduction is the 30 million yuan from the Ministry of the Navy, followed by the 15 million yuan from the Ministry of the Army, and 13 million yuan each from the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of Communications. The other provinces have all suffered larger-than-expected reductions and are all embarrassed. The Ministry of the Navy, in particular, is reducing 13 million yuan from business object fees, warship repair fees, warship manufacturing fees, exercise fees, and travel expenses, plus a delay of 17 million yuan. The excessive reduction has left them in a daze. Also, the Ministry of Communications' object fees and personnel expenses are closely related, and the reduction in object fees will inevitably lead to a reduction in personnel. This move will inevitably cause the current employees to feel uneasy about their livelihoods, so they are expressing opposition. How will the Hamaguchi cabinet, which failed last year in its proposal to reduce salaries by 10%, implement its austerity policy in the future? It is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 7th - The government's draft implementation budget this time is truly unavoidable during this time of extreme financial difficulty, so there are many who express sympathy, but there are also opponents. The voices of criticism against the government are gradually rising among the opposition parties and other parties. The main reasons for the opposition are roughly as follows: (1) The government said in the special parliament that there was no need to disclose the estimated revenue and never announced it, which was seen as a question from the beginning. Now the question is very clear. (2) Most of the delayed amount is continued expenses. This delay will inevitably be postponed to the next year and beyond. (3) Under the guise of austerity, more than 20 million yuan has been delayed. The real intention is nothing more than to escape the double whammy of naval replenishment and tax cuts. (4) The government's lack of direction and plan will inevitably deprive senior officials of their affairs and exacerbate the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 7th - The giant tycoon of the business community, Go Seino, Zosuke Otokoyama, and others believe that the Hamaguchi cabinet's exclusive pursuit of tightening policies will inevitably lead to an extreme decline in the lives of the people, which is detrimental to both the government and the people. The rationalization of consumption, that is, the abolition of uselessness, can be encouraged, but preventing the use of necessary commodities may threaten production and should be considered carefully. They intend to make suggestions to the government and are currently urging the Economic Federation, the Industrial Club, and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to jointly proceed. Go Seino, Zosuke Otokoyama, spoke to reporters about this matter, saying, "What we want to say is that the so-called rationalization policy adopted by the current government treats both beneficial and unprofitable matters equally, which will inevitably cause beneficial matters to become increasingly depressed. This point should be carefully considered. We intend to make suggestions to the government, advising it to add some active policies."</p>
<h3>Italian-French Situation Deteriorates</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister's Speech Contains Intimidation, French People Do Not Want to Continue Negotiations</p>
<p>National Society Dispatch, Paris, 6th - It is heard that France has not yet officially replied to Italian Foreign Minister Grandi's suggestion regarding the construction of warships before France and Italy continue negotiations. According to semi-official sources, France does not want to open negotiations with Italy under the intimidation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini.</p>
<p>World Society News, Paris - After the recent sensational remarks made by the Italian Prime Minister, the French government is temporarily unwilling to continue negotiations that began two years ago regarding the border between North Africa and Lapia and the status of Italian residents in Tunisia. The French media generally believe that Mussolini's speech clearly contains threats, and how can negotiations be continued? At the same time, the French government is increasing its defenses on the southern border of French territory in Africa to prepare for any eventuality. Observing the current situation, France's naval plan has been expanded to respond to Italy's new naval construction. German Cabinet Submits</p>
<h3>Emergency Financial Proposals</h3>
<p>National Society Dispatch, Berlin, 6th - The emergency financial proposals submitted by the cabinet have attracted much attention from the newspapers. The proposals estimate that a tax on unmarried men and a special tax on certain salaries could raise 350 million marks, savings from social insurance could raise 150 million marks, a cigarette tax could raise 50 million marks, and the sale of preferred shares of the government railway could yield 100 million marks. The above, together with the reduction in the budget of 160 million marks, could total 775 million marks, which is sufficient to make up for the deficit in the budget. It is generally believed that although this plan is supported by the government parties, it may not be passed in the parliament.</p>
<h3>German Farmers Drive Away Water Patrol</h3>
<p>Dig Ditches, Build Moats to Block Rescue Teams</p>
<p>National Society Dispatch, Hamburg, 6th - After the farmers of Ningduf Village drove away the water patrol with farm tools, they dug ditches and built moats around the village to block the arrival of rescue teams. This matter has surprised all of Germany, indicating that the farmers are thinking of rebelling due to their increasingly difficult situation.</p>

<h3>British Prime Minister Publishes White Paper</h3>
<p>Regarding the English Channel Tunnel Project</p>
<p>Reuters Dispatch, London, 6th - British Prime Minister MacDonald issued a white paper on the English Channel Tunnel issue, saying that whether this project is feasible is still in doubt. Furthermore, the huge cost and long period of time are major economic weaknesses. In addition to economic and military considerations, the government must also take into account possible foreign reactions. The Imperial Defense Committee believes that the construction of the tunnel, from a military standpoint, does not see any benefit. It is not only useless but will also increase the military constraints on Britain, so this proposal cannot be supported, he says.</p>

<h3>Japanese Shipbuilding Industry Relief Plan</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Agency, Tokyo, 7th - The plan to rescue the shipbuilding industry after military reduction by the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Zuo Sangi includes: 1. Prohibiting the import of old ships that are more than 25 years old. 2. Encouraging domestic production of automobiles. It has been submitted to the regular cabinet meeting yesterday. Although the Finance Minister's plan has attracted much attention at this time, large companies in the shipbuilding industry, such as Kawasaki Shipbuilding and Mitsubishi Shipbuilding, have already started manufacturing aircraft and are working hard to open up a difficult situation. Most of the others, however, believe that in order to engage in manufacturing other than warships, the first thing to do is to train workers, and the most important thing is the tightening of funds. If the cabinet does not provide funds for this, even a good plan cannot be implemented, he says. Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture and Mining's Opinions on Unemployment Relief</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining previously received an order from the Executive Yuan to draft opinions on providing relief to unemployed citizens. Now, the Ministry of Agriculture has drafted specific plans and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review. The opinions are recorded below: It is found that the number of unemployed people in our country was thoroughly investigated and estimated by various parties several years ago, and the total number should be around 170 million. Recently, military affairs have been frequent, banditry has arisen from time to time, all industries have withered, and people's livelihoods have become unsustainable. The number of unemployed people should be greater than before. To seek fundamental relief, a comprehensive plan must be made, and specific plans must be formulated. We must work together to achieve this. The main points are summarized into four items as follows: (1) Maintaining Labor: In recent years, the situation has been unstable, and industry and commerce have stagnated, resulting in a daily decrease in labor opportunities for the people. Most of the existing occupations are unable to be maintained. It seems that the competent authorities should conduct detailed investigations on the industries under their jurisdiction that can accommodate workers, and strive to support them to prevent unnecessary business closures. For private enterprises with weak financial resources that are difficult to continue, they should also consider the urgency and request the government to grant subsidies or loans to prevent the reduction of jobs and the increase of unemployed people. (2) Increasing Labor to Relieve Unemployment: Relieving unemployment is not only about maintaining existing jobs, but also about focusing on expanding production and increasing job opportunities. Now is the time when unemployed people are in urgent need of relief. The central and local competent authorities should, within their respective jurisdictions, select urgent and easy-to-implement matters regarding construction matters that should be carried out, and plan and proceed with them on a scheduled basis. For matters managed by private individuals and groups, the government should also provide appropriate capital subsidies or loans to encourage labor. (3) Introducing Occupations: People's unemployment is not only due to the lack of job opportunities, but also due to the imbalance between labor supply and demand. The country's industries are diverse and the area is vast. The needs and supply of work often become isolated from each other and cannot be communicated. Therefore, appropriate job introduction agencies should be established in the central and local areas to conduct separate investigations and introduce each other to ensure that both supply and demand are secure. The Ministry of Labor previously drafted a draft of the Job Introduction Regulations in conjunction with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and submitted it to the Executive Yuan, but it was not approved for promulgation. It is found that the introduction agencies and methods stipulated in the regulations are quite complete. It is proposed to approve and implement them, which seems to be beneficial to unemployment relief. (4) Supporting Unemployment: To relieve unemployment, we should actively seek job opportunities for the people and passively provide insurance and protection for the lives of the unemployed. For example, compulsory savings, unemployment insurance, etc., are all designed to support the lives of the unemployed. Countries have long established laws and actively implemented them. Therefore, in the event of an economic panic, although unemployment increases, workers can still maintain their lives. It seems that our country should slightly learn from its intentions and try to promote it to cultivate the people's spirit of diligence and thrift and to achieve the effect of social mutual assistance.</p>

<p>Summaries of Important News</p>
<p>The above four points are the outlines of the methods to relieve national unemployment. However, the legislative administration and the duties of various ministries, commissions, and local governments are related to this relief method. It is proposed to submit it to the competent authorities to formulate regulations to ensure progress. As for the two methods of maintaining labor and increasing labor, which fall within the scope of the duties of the Ministry, special measures are proposed and listed on the left: A. Matters related to agriculture: (1) Maintaining the old reclamation businesses in Jianghuai and Northeast (Reason) It is found that developing wasteland and transplanting farmers is essential for the relief of unemployed people. There is still a lot of wasteland in China, and development should not be delayed. In recent years, the reclamation businesses in the reclamation areas of the three eastern provinces and Jianghuai Salt have been quite well-established and worthy of attention. However, the reclamation companies have suffered many failures due to capital shortages, bandit disturbances, and unfamiliarity with scientific methods. Farmers who rely on reclamation for their livelihoods are displaced and unemployed. Taking the reclamation area under Huainan, Tongru, Yanfu and other nine counties as an example, its reclaimable area is about 15 million mu, and every 30 mu can support one household, and each household can support four people, which can support 2 million people. It is proposed to immediately formulate measures to maintain it and allow the old reclamation businesses to continue and the livelihoods of the reclamation people to be supported. (Measures) It is proposed to issue 30 million yuan of reclamation bonds with state-owned wasteland and reclamation land in various places as collateral, with half of the funds used for public construction in the reclamation area. As for the construction of the reclamation area by the government, the following items should be noted: (1) Promulgate regulations to urge and encourage the development of reclamation (2) Build river embankments in the reclamation area (3) Determine policies in the salt reclamation area, change salt production to sun-drying, move grasslands to mature fields, and pay attention to subsidies and incentives for reclamation (4) Promote and guide rural cooperative businesses (5) Establish agricultural reclamation experimental fields (7) Establish model agricultural promotion areas (2) Planning the reclamation and animal husbandry business in Hetao (Reason) There is a lot of wasteland in the northeastern, northwestern, and southwestern border provinces. It is necessary to actively develop it to open up rich resources and provide resources for transplantation. However, all parties are acting at the same time, the scale is too large, and the funding is too much, which cannot be started at once. It should be delayed slightly and planned in detail to ensure progress. It is proposed to select a suitable area with less funding and easier results for the reclamation area to start first. It is found that the reclaimable area of Hetao is about 50 million mu, and the water and grass are abundant, which is conducive to irrigation. Each household receives 100 mu of land, which can support 500,000 households. A family of eight can support 4 million people. (Measures) The government will establish the Hetao Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Bureau to specifically manage the reclamation and animal husbandry affairs in the area. In addition to the roads, police, schools, experimental fields, and other matters planned and handled by the bureau, the bureau will urge people from the mainland to transplant and reclaim wasteland in the area. The funds required for wasteland reclamation will be funded by the government with 30 million to 50 million yuan in installments. Those who go to reclaim wasteland will be loaned 130 yuan per person for reclamation expenses (including 60 yuan for housing utensils, etc., and 70 yuan for plowing cattle, seeds, agricultural tools, etc. This is based on the cost when Shanxi Province办屯垦was engaged in military reclamation in Hetao, Ulan Daobao, and Langshan Bay, etc.). This loan will be repaid annually by the reclamation households after three years of income. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Anhui Chamber of Commerce Union Holds Representative Congress</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication The Anhui Provincial Chamber of Commerce Union convened the second representative congress on the 3rd. The preparatory meeting decided to hold the official opening ceremony on the 5th. The venue is still in the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce. The meeting was held at 1:00 pm today (5th). 71 representatives from the General Chamber of Commerce, County Chamber of Commerce, and Town Chamber of Commerce attended. Chairman Wu Xingzhou performed the ceremony as usual, and then began the discussion. Everyone believed that the National Government had already promulgated the new Chamber of Commerce Law and limited the reorganization to be completed before August 15. The union has received 49 members, which is enough to reorganize the number. Therefore, it was decided to implement the reorganization on June 8. At the same time, a telegram was sent to the Anhui Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Government to request that personnel be sent to Wuhu to supervise the election in order to show prudence. The official congress will be held daily from the 5th. However, due to the unstable situation and the rice shortage in various counties, it is difficult for the representatives to stay in Wuhu for a long time. It is planned to limit the meeting period to five days. However, because there are more than 60 proposals from various counties, such as the proposal to send representatives to participate in the tariff conference, the various county tariff bureaus attach cards to secretly collect taxes, and fraudulently establish names to harass merchants, requests for pensions for military losses, local security cases for bandits harassing, requests to abolish the additional salt tax, abolish the Anhui sailing rice donation tax, and the special consumption tax rate after the tariff reduction shall not exceed the original tariff rate. Abolish the unique sugar tax in Anhui, ban foreign merchants from invading the mainland to operate businesses, and restore the chamber of commerce regiment. In order to save meeting time, it was decided to organize a review committee and divide it into four groups: general affairs, finance, taxation, and regulations, to review the proposals and select those with similar properties and merge them separately, and then submit them to the congress for discussion. On the spot, Anhui South, Anhui Central, and Anhui North each elected eight people to organize a review meeting, and decided that tomorrow (6th) the congress will be adjourned for one day to hold a review meeting to review the proposals. The congress will continue on the 7th. Then, the Hefei representative made a temporary motion that the drought in the county last year was unprecedented. One yuan of silver only bought three liters of rice, and there was nowhere to buy it. The tree bark and grass roots had been dug up and eaten. Previously, compatriots living abroad raised funds to purchase foreign rice and transported it to Fei for flat selling. Unexpectedly, 200 bags of foreign rice were detained by the tariff card in San Han River, which hindered the people's food. The congress was requested to assist. It was decided to send representatives Cui Lianggong and others to the Anhui Finance Commissioner's Office to request that the card be ordered to release the flat rice to save the disaster victims. At 5 o'clock, the meeting was adjourned (June 5).</p>
<h3>Jin Army Attacks Lokou Again, Repelled</h3>
<p>Jinan Communication Today (4th) at 11:00 am, the port suddenly heard loud cannon fire from the north. At 12:00, the cannon fire was the most dense. At 1:00 pm, the cannon fire gradually stopped. I visited Zhang Yue, the chief of staff of the First Army Corps, to inquire about the situation. According to him, two battalions of Jin army infantry went to the north bank of the Yellow River in Lokou, intending to scout our movements and contain our army. They were repelled by our troops stationed in Lokou across the river with Dachengyao's attack. The Jin army immediately collapsed and suffered heavy casualties. Only Xiaolujiazhuang in the northwest of Lokou caught fire due to the falling bombs and was quickly extinguished. More than 20 ships west of the iron bridge were also affected. The Jin army in Qingcheng on the east road broke out of the siege yesterday, determined to escape. They were intercepted by our besieging army and fled back to the city. The enemy army in Dong'a on the west road now has only one battalion left, 20 miles away from our army and has not yet made contact. In short, our army is now heavily defended, and it is difficult for the Jin army to cross the river even if they launch a large-scale attack. In addition, in order to be cautious about the defense of Jinan and facilitate command, Han Fuju specially appointed Wang Wenbin, a staff officer of the headquarters, as the director of the Jinan Municipal Public Security Bureau today. Wang will take office within days (June 4).</p>
<h3>Financial Crisis in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Several companies have run aground due to the soaring gold ticket prices. Qingdao Communication Since the Japanese occupation era, the Yokohama Specie Bank was established in Qingdao to issue banknotes circulating in the mainland of Shandong Province. At that time, the financial industry was almost entirely controlled by the Japanese. After our country took over, many Chinese also invested in establishing banks, hoping to compete with the Japanese. However, due to economic constraints, they were not as strong as the Japanese and often failed. In recent months, due to the soaring gold prices, Qingdao's financial industry has suffered huge losses, but the silver market has not been so tense. Unexpectedly, the Japanese gold ticket has suddenly increased from 72 exchanges (that is, 72 yuan of Japanese gold tickets can be exchanged for 100 yuan of Chinese silver) to 47 exchanges (that is, 47 yuan of Japanese gold tickets can be exchanged for 100 yuan of Chinese silver). The financial industry was greatly panicked by its impact. The first to bear the brunt was Xinji Money Shop. Xinji has been established in Qingdao for more than ten years. Not only is its own capital sufficient, but many of its shareholders are also respected figures in the business community, and manager Zou Fuxin is also an executive member of the Chamber of Commerce and one of the leaders of the financial industry. The shop has five immovable properties and three branches in Qingdao, which are extremely solid in terms of form. This time, due to the impact of gold tickets, the losses amounted to more than 200,000 yuan. It suddenly ran aground on the 2nd. The next two were Shen and Guangmaosheng Money Shops, which also suffered huge losses due to the sudden rise in gold tickets and ran aground one after another. There are six other money shops that are also in danger of running aground due to the same losses. After the above-mentioned shops ran aground, the financial industry was greatly shocked. In order to maintain the market, the Chamber of Commerce, on the one hand, cleared the assets of Xinji and Shenxinghao's creditor groups, and on the other hand, held a temporary meeting of all executive committees to discuss relief measures. It is said that the Chinese money shops and banks have been affected by this, with losses of at least several thousand yuan and up to tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of yuan. In particular, the fish industry has suffered the greatest losses. Yesterday, the silver market in the exchange was also affected by this, with no market and extreme depression. The financial industry in Qingdao suddenly presented a pessimistic picture (June 4).</p>
<h3>Min Workers and Students Clash</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Communication At 7 pm on the 1st, Fujian College student Yu Zhaopu and Weng Qifa took a Fuxing Company bus from Nantai to the city. After the bus arrived at the Nanmendou station, the company's ticket collector collected fares from Yu and Weng. Yu immediately gave him a yuan of silver and asked him to return the remaining money. The ticket collector said that Yu and his party of five people forcibly demanded five tickets, totaling 400 yuan of silver. Yu and others refused to accept and immediately argued with the company. The company's staff did not investigate the facts and immediately incited the crowd to use force. Yu and others were forced to retreat in embarrassment. Several Guozhuan students happened to pass by and witnessed the situation. They angrily questioned the company. The company again incited the crowd to use weapons to besiege the students. He Guangqian, He Tingwen, Weng Tingben, Weng Weihuan, and others were imprisoned in the company. When the police from the third station were dispatched to suppress the situation, the city bureau's Browning pistol team arrived at the scene and saw that the kidnapped students were still being beaten. They took the four thugs and the beaten students to the bureau for questioning. However, the workers said that the company's bus that night entered the city from Nantai with five students who did not buy tickets. When they got off at Nanmen Station, the company's staff asked them to make up the tickets according to the regulations. Only one of the five people took out one yuan of silver and immediately returned the remaining money. At that time, three of the five people had already left first. The remaining two said that we only have two people and cannot calculate according to five people. Therefore, there was a conflict. The students left for about half an hour. Suddenly, fifty or sixty students came. At that time, the 16th, 14th, and 18th three buses arrived. The students smashed the buses with stones and went to the company's office at Nanmen Terminal to make trouble. The guards hurriedly closed the door, and the students had all rushed to the company's office, and the door and window glass were damaged beyond recognition. The entire 16th bus was damaged. The company urgently requested the police from the Nanmen Station to dissuade them, and some were injured. The students who smashed the bus have been detained and questioned by the city bureau. The company's workers fear being beaten on the way and have temporarily suspended the bus service. At the same time, they convened a meeting at the Haoxing Temple in Nanmendou and decided to go to the Provincial Party Headquarters to request legal action to protect the transportation business. However, the city bureau sent police to monitor and advised them to only send representatives to the Party Headquarters. Everyone agreed to do so. The company has suffered huge business losses due to the strike. Yesterday, the Nanmen to Pingliqiao section was restored, and the Nanmen to Ximen section will also be restored today. The students from Fuqing who stayed in the province also gathered students from various schools of the same origin at Lihuan yesterday afternoon to discuss how to deal with the matter (June 4).</p>
<h3>The Inauguration of the Min Party and Government Committee</h3>
<p>Chen Peikun serves as the acting chairman. Fuzhou Communication The new Min Provincial Party Instructors Kang Shaozhou, Chen Lianfen, and Gan Yun, and the Provincial Government Committee member Chen Peikun, arrived in the province together. The instructors held a temporary meeting on May 31 to assign committee work. They used a roll-call vote to elect Zhan Tiaoyuan and Kang Shaozhou as standing committee members, Feng Ji'an as the Minister of Organization, Chen Lianfen as the Minister of Training, and Gan Yun as the Minister of Propaganda. Gan Yun also proposed to recommend Kang Shaozhou as the concurrently president of the Minguo Daily. The inauguration ceremony was scheduled for June 11 and a telegram was sent to the Central Executive Committee for record. The staff of various departments have also been reorganized and will be announced after the committees take office and the formal meeting is passed. Jiang Pingfan, one of the three provincial government committee members, arrived at the Construction Department on June 2 and appointed Pan Xunchu as the chief secretary, Lin Jian as the chief of the first section, and Yao Yimou as the accountant and general affairs officer. At the same time, Gao Chaodong, the director of the Water Conservancy Bureau, was removed from his post and replaced by Yan Hanming. Lin Jinan is scheduled to go to the Education Department on June 5 to take over the seal and go to the department on the 9th. He will resign immediately after the agency is cleared. Chen Peikun, who is also the acting chairman of the provincial government and the heads of the Civil and Financial Departments, believes that it is difficult to take care of the three positions and has telegraphed the National Government to resign. He has now received a telegram from Yang Shuzhuang agreeing that Chen will act as the chairman of the provincial government. The National Government will consult with the Central Government to select people to act as the heads of the Civil and Financial Departments. However, there is no definite news on when Chen will take office as the acting chairman (June 4). Beining Road</p>
<h3>Huludao Port Construction Contract</h3>
<p>Shenyang Communication: The Huludao port construction contract of the Beining Railway is attracting much attention from various sectors. Previously, due to the port not being under construction, the contract details were kept secret. Now, from the Railway Bureau, we have obtained the full text of the contract. As for its engineering plan, most of it is in foreign languages, so it is briefly omitted. This contract is made in Tianjin on January 24th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, which is January 24th, 1930 in the Western calendar, by Gao Jiyi, the Director of the Beining Railway Administration, representing the Beining Railway Administration (hereinafter referred to as "the Administration") under the instruction of the Ministry of Railways of the National Government and the supervision of the Northeast Transportation Committee, and Tao Jinshi, the Chief Representative in China of the Netherlands Harbor Works Company, representing the Netherlands Harbor Works Company (hereinafter referred to as "the Contractor"). (Article 1) General Provisions: The Contractor, at a cost of US$6,400,000, shall undertake and complete the various projects (hereinafter referred to as "the Project") listed in the engineering specifications, work procedures, and drawings attached to this contract, in accordance with the instructions of the Chief Engineer of Port Affairs of the Administration (hereinafter referred to as "the Engineer") to his satisfaction. However, the total cost of this project shall be subject to increases or decreases as permitted in this contract. (Article 2) Payment: The above cost shall be paid by the Administration in monthly installments at the end of each month, based on the Engineer's certificate proving that the Contractor's work is indeed proceeding in accordance with the work schedule attached to this contract. Each installment shall be US$95,000 until the total amount is paid. The first two installments, for February and March, shall be paid when the ships and machinery required for actual construction according to the work schedule arrive at Huludao. The above work schedule shows the approximate preparation and progress of each project within the stipulated contract period and the dates on which each part of the project should commence and be completed. If the Engineer withholds a certificate due to project delays, the withholding period shall not exceed the time required by the Contractor to catch up with the delay in a certain part of the project. During this withholding period, the monthly installments shall be suspended and temporarily deposited by the Administration into the Huludao Reserve Fund account established in the bank mentioned in Article 5 of this contract. No interest shall be paid to the Contractor on this withheld deposit. (Article 3) Special Guarantee: The Administration shall deduct 5% from its monthly installments as a special guarantee for the performance of this contract. This guarantee money shall be kept by the Administration without interest until the expiration of the warranty period in Article 8 of this contract.

Half of this deposit, which is five hundred thousand yuan, cannot be withdrawn unless signed by the Administration and the Chinese representative of the Contractor. However, after the Administration pays the 63rd installment or when this contract ceases to be effective for the Administration in accordance with the provisions of Article 10, the Administration may withdraw the money by signing alone. After receiving this deposit, the bank shall immediately notify the Contractor of this arrangement. (Article 6) Contract Period: The various projects shall be carried out at a reasonable speed, and all projects shall be completed and handed over to the Administration before October 15th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, which is October 15th, 1935 in the Western calendar, i.e., within five years and six months from the date of commencement of construction as stipulated below. If the Contractor fails to complete and hand over all projects to the Administration within the above stipulated time limit, he shall pay the Administration one thousand current yuan per day as compensation for the loss until the date of complete delivery. If the Contractor's delay in delivery is due to natural disasters that cannot be resisted by human power, or due to major changes in the engineering specifications attached to this contract that are not due to the Contractor's fault, the Engineer may grant the Contractor a corresponding extension. The Contractor shall immediately begin preparing everything and promptly start actual construction when the weather is suitable, but in any case, no later than April 15th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, which is April 15th, 1930 in the Western calendar. (Article 7) Use of Completed Parts of the Project: If the Administration wishes to open and use one of the completed parts of the Huludao seaport within the work period stipulated in this contract, the Contractor shall not refuse, restrict, or prevent it, provided that this action by the Administration does not excessively hinder the progress of the project. (Article 8) Warranty: The Contractor shall warrant the project for one year from the date of completion and handover to the Administration. During the warranty period, the Administration may freely construct or install any kind of buildings or machinery on the project. (Article 9) Loss: From the date of signing this contract to the date of expiration of the warranty period, all rectification and compensation for any</p>

<h3>Wuhu Express News</h3>
<p>The People's Self-Defense Corps and the county police guard team that mutinied in Jing County looted shops and fled the city. They are still entrenched in the Damu Mountain and have not dispersed. The people of Jing County have telegraphed requesting the dispatch of troops to encircle and suppress them. The Wuhu Municipal Party Department previously reported to the provincial authorities that Yu Mingxun, the Director of the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau, was involved in the transport of opium and was suspected of protecting party-destroying elements. The provincial government has now ordered Sun Gongming, the Magistrate of Wuhu County, to thoroughly investigate and report back for verification. The Director of the Anhui Construction Department convened a provincial mineral tax conference. Shao Yizhou, the Director of the Wuhu Municipal Government Office, and Director Jin of the Provincial Official Mining Bureau attended the meeting in the province yesterday. The Nanjing Li Chengji Construction Factory contracted to build barracks outside Chaoyangmen. Because it could not be completed on time, the guarantor submitted a report to the headquarters ordering the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau and the county government to seal up Li Chengji's Wuhu properties, De Xing Miscellaneous Goods Store, and houses to offset the losses. The Public Security Bureau and the county government have sent personnel to carry out the closure today (June 6).</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Express News</h3>
<p>The Central Anti-Opium Committee telegraphed the provincial government yesterday that the Second National Anti-Opium Conference, originally scheduled for July 1st by the Executive Yuan's order, has now been postponed due to the ongoing military operations and traffic obstructions, making it difficult for representatives from all parties to arrive. The Executive Yuan has approved waiting for the military operations to be pacified before rescheduling the conference. In addition to separate telegrams, this is specially notified. The Civil Affairs Department previously received a petition from Zhang Liqian and other citizens of Yuhang, requesting that the three villages of Zhangjiatang, etc., should not be included in the territory of Lin'an County to avoid disputes. It ordered the two counties of Yu and Lin to investigate and reply. Now, according to the reply, village chiefs of the relevant villages were invited to survey and found that the three villages of Zhangjiatang, Dongjiatang, and Gaojiatang in Yuhang are all within the territory of Lin'an. It has now been delimited, with the Daxi River, a natural feature, as the boundary, starting from the northeast of Liangting to the southeast of Shiqiao, as the new line between Yu and Lin. The bandit leader Dai Dexun in Tiantai is very rampant, repeatedly committing robberies, arson, and murders. After receiving the report, the provincial government ordered the county magistrate to supervise the military and police and informed the two counties of Linhai and Ninghai to assist in the arrest. At the same time, a joint suppression was scheduled to capture the bandit gang within a specified period to pacify the area. The Liangzhe Salt Affairs Audit Branch submitted a report to the head office yesterday, stating that it was heard that Jiao Dati, the Director of the Liangzhe Anti-Smuggling Bureau, had already submitted a resignation application. His vacancy was transferred by the Ministry of Finance to Lu Chongdan, the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of the Five Prefectures of Jiangsu. However, Mr. Lu expressed that he would not take the position. If there is no responsible official in charge of the anti-smuggling camp team in Liangzhe, it is feared that the anti-smuggling affairs will inevitably be relaxed, affecting tax revenue. The assistant manager, in view of this, intends to ask the head office to transfer and discuss with the anti-smuggling office to resolve this issue as soon as possible to benefit tax revenue.

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>A prisoner wept and confessed to being extorted and beaten. The county government recently received a secret letter reporting that old prisoners in the prison colluded with prison guards to extort opium offenders and those who were lightly sentenced. Those who did not comply were brutally beaten with corporal punishment, and the situation was unbearable. Wu Jiyu, who was imprisoned for opium case in Zhangze, was cited as evidence of being extorted and abused. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Jin immediately summoned Wu Jiyu for interrogation by Judge Du. Wu initially refused to confess directly, but wept and sobbed. Only after repeated interrogation by the judge did he tearfully confess that he was arrested and detained in the detention center in mid-April and extorted more than ten yuan for expenses. After being sentenced and transferred to the big prison in mid-May, a guard named Fan Tou insisted on extracting thirty-six yuan for expenses, and not a penny could be reduced. Because I had no way to respond, I was subjected to private beatings and unbearable pain. So I told my family to scrape together fourteen yuan and send it to Zhang Siquan, an old prisoner, who took away a cloth shirt and pants, but it was still not enough. During the day, I was forced to make paper money, and at night, I was transferred to the side of the pit toilet, saying that if I could not make up the amount within ten days, I would still be beaten every day. This kind of thing was done by the old prisoners Wu Qinghe and Guo Laoer in collusion with Zhang Siquan and the general prison guards. Those people treat bandits and thieves very politely. The old prisoners get 30% of the extorted money, and the guards get 70%, which is divided among them for spending. Even the extremely poor people painfully and miserably ask their families to scrape together their meager possessions to satisfy their desires. After confessing, they asked to be transferred to detention to avoid retaliation, and the interrogating official approved it. After the interrogation, County Magistrate Jin immediately instructed the warden to earnestly rectify the situation and heavily shackle the old prisoners and strictly punish them. The guards who colluded and acted recklessly will also be dealt with separately, and all prisoners will be warned that if they are subjected to cruel treatment again, they are allowed to report for punishment. The county government convened a cheap rice meeting. The county government convened a meeting earlier to handle cheap rice matters and appointed seven cheap rice commissioners to prepare for it. Yesterday (the 7th), the county government convened a meeting of the cheap rice committee. Among the commissioners, Yuan Chunlin was accused of embezzling the national treasury while serving as the district chief. He was ordered to return to the judicial authorities for handling and was suspended from his position as the district chief. The county government changed Lu Longxiang to replace him as a commissioner. It is now learned that the resolutions include establishing a cheap rice headquarters on the 11th of this month, temporarily using Quanjietang as the address. Branch offices will be set up in each district, and the funds will be distributed and managed by each district. Zhang Kaiqi and Lu Longxiang will be appointed to draft detailed cheap rice measures, and district chiefs will be convened on the 16th to discuss and implement them. Organize the Clearance Bureau as a prelude. The county government recently received an order from the province to prepare to organize the Clearance Bureau to pacify the area. In this county and the surrounding four townships, the bandits' flames are rampant, and robberies occur from time to time. People have no peaceful place to live, and fields are left uncultivated. Handling clearance is indeed an important task. The county government's 60th county administration meeting resolved that the county government will convene all county agencies, groups, and impartial gentry to discuss and organize. The wind and clouds changed suddenly, and hail fell. The weather here has gradually become hot recently. Unexpectedly, yesterday (the 7th) at about 3 pm, the weather suddenly changed, and the sky was overcast. Accompanied by a violent wind and heavy rain, hail as big as beans fell, making a noise on the ground, lasting about ten minutes before stopping.</p>

They first tied up Cai's wife, Qian, who was beaten when she cried for help. The thugs then entered and rummaged through boxes and cabinets, looting 192 yuan in cash, clothing, and more than ten shi of rice, wheat, broad beans, etc., and severely beat Liang Laoer, the landlord of the second room in the east wing. They divided the loot into several boats and sailed towards the Yantie River.</p>

In addition to finding suitable housing, County Magistrate Sun specially convened a meeting of the Standing Committee of the County Chamber of Commerce and representatives of various industries and tax authorities yesterday to raise funds, as there were many wounded soldiers and expenses were required for reception. County Magistrate Sun first explained the intention, saying that the medical treatment has been undertaken voluntarily by the Doctors' Association, but medicines and various application items must be purchased by raising funds. Calculating ten yuan per person, one thousand people would require 10,000 yuan. However, on the spot, only the tax office and the special tax bureau each pledged 200 yuan, and the liquor license tax collection office pledged 50 yuan. The business community said that silkworm farming was poor and various industries were depressed, so they would wait for the County Chamber of Commerce to convene a meeting for discussion before determining the amount. The Director of the County Property Management Resigns: The Wuxi County Property Management Committee recently received an order from the province to reorganize. The county appointed Chen Zhanru and Hua Shaochun as director and deputy director, respectively, and Rong Desheng and Jiang Daoshan as members, with a deadline for formal establishment. However, Director Chen felt that he could not cope with the situation and had to move funds from east to west whenever the local financial expenditure was insufficient since he took over as acting director last summer. He specially sent a letter yesterday to firmly resign. In addition to sending a letter to retain him, County Magistrate Sun also reported to the Civil Affairs Department for review. Preparing to Establish a Women's Labor Supplementary School: In order to ensure that all female workers in silk factories receive considerable education, the Labor Improvement Association specially convened representatives from the County Education Bureau and silk factory trade unions yesterday to discuss and resolve: (1) Each factory will establish a women's labor supplementary school, named the Women's Labor Supplementary School of a certain factory.

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Many Shops Robbed in Shangdian Town: On the afternoon of the 5th, at about 10 pm, more than ten bandits suddenly came to Shangdian Town in the 7th District of Wuyi County, armed with short guns. They first went to the township office to search for firearms but found nothing. They then went to Yun Xuan Shu's house, smashed the door and pried open the windows, and beat Xuan Shu severely, forcing him to hand over silver dollars. They looted everything in the inner room, and all the joint contracts and account books were destroyed. Then they dragged Xuan Shu out of the door and forced him to act as a guide to search and rob house by house.

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Funding for District Offices: In order to complete local autonomy, the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs ordered all counties to implement the establishment of district offices. However, the original autonomous funding of each county was already exhausted and could not be allocated. The province's funds were also extremely tight and difficult to subsidize. In addition to the existing autonomous surcharges used for education funds being recovered and still used for district office expenses, the department has also issued a general order to all county governments to find ways to raise funds. It is now learned that Hangzhou County, Tongxiang County, and Sheng County have all requested to collect additional levies under the item of land tax compensation. The provincial government has approved the request to collect an additional two jiao per shi of land tax compensation in Hangzhou County, three jiao per liang of land tax in Tongxiang County, and one jiao and four fen and three li per liang of land tax in Sheng County.</p>

<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Nine Robbers Arrested: Zhu Futang and Chen Debiao, detectives of the Ningbo City Detective Team, were patrolling in front of Chongyu Pawnshop at Xinhe Pier, Jiangdong, at around 9:00 AM on the 5th when they saw four people holding silk floss, cotton robes, lined spring coats, trousers, etc., pawning them for a total of ten yuan. Suspecting their behavior, they stepped forward to question them. One of them took the opportunity to escape. The detectives arrested the other three and searched them, finding electric lights, gold-plated silver rings, silver bracelets, and a pawn ticket from Hui'an Pawnshop worth three yuan. They were taken to the team for interrogation. One confessed to being Cao Xiurong, 37 years old, from Tiantai, a doctor currently practicing medicine in Guodu City. Another claimed to be Wang Laoer, 36 years old, from Tiantai, working as a mat weaver. Another claimed to be Chu Dexing, 32 years old, previously a tailor, and a former soldier in the security team who had now retired. The remaining statements were cunning and unforthcoming. Captain Yu suspected that the pawned clothes were suspicious and sent detectives to the countryside for investigation. According to the detective's report, the three men were indeed bandits, and the stolen goods were robbed from the Huilong Temple in Guodu City, Southern Township. Another fugitive, Cao Zhangbiao, 28 years old, also from Tiantai and the brother of Cao Xiurong, was arrested in the countryside. After Captain Yu interrogated them one by one, the four bandits confessed to the crime. They were sent to the Public Security Bureau for review. The monks of Huilong Temple were also summoned to the team to identify the stolen goods. Furthermore, Fu Shulin, the head of the Zhuangqiao Public Security Sub-bureau in Cixi East, received a confidential report from a detective the night before, stating that five robbers from Taizhou, Chen Fuping, Xu Zhanghai, Jin Ruigen, Qiu Xianghe, and Wang Qizhang, etc., were armed with sharp knives and awls. They had robbed continuously for three nights in Hetousi, Huilong Temple, Majiaqiao Bay, and Lianxin, Southern Township. The largest loss suffered by a certain family reached over 500 yuan. After receiving the report, Chief Fu remained calm and set out at night, rushing to Hetousi. The five bandits, including Chen Fuping, were captured and several small knives were found on the spot. The Chen bandits confessed to being peddlers from Taizhou, residing in Mengmenling Mountain in the northern mountains. The rest of their statements were vague, and one of them only admitted to stealing and refused to admit to being a robber. Chief Fu also learned that several other accomplices related to the case were hiding in Ningbo City. He also sent detectives to Ningbo yesterday to investigate.</p>
<p>Voluntary Slaughter Ban Causes Meat Prices to Skyrocket: Ningbo City butchers went on strike to protest the construction of a new second slaughterhouse, causing restaurants to send people to Zhuangqiao, Cixi, and other places to buy meat, resulting in a sharp increase in prices. It is said that one yuan can only buy two jin, and it is not easy to buy even that unless you know someone.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Salt Merchants Meeting on Huge Loan Case: Shaoxing salt merchants yesterday received instructions from the Transportation Department that the Ministry of Finance had approved a loan of 7.88 million yuan secured by the regular and additional taxes of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces. Zhejiang was allocated 3 million yuan, to be raised by merchants issuing promissory notes to be pledged to a syndicate. The loan was to be repaid in installments within six months from the date of signing the contract. Representatives should be nominated to go to Shanghai to negotiate and sign the contract. Because the loan was too large to be borne by the salt merchants, a meeting of all salt merchants in eastern Zhejiang was convened in Shaoxing on the 15th to discuss relief measures.</p>
<p>Slaughter Tax Tender: The Shaoxing County Government, because Dong Shuiqing, the merchant responsible for the slaughter tax, had accumulated arrears, which were irrecoverable, had requested the Department of Finance for approval to revoke his license according to the rules. A new tender will now be held on the 9th, with a minimum bid of 29,500 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Escorting Bandit Intercepted En Route: The Xiaoshan County Court escorted a Sheng bandit from the Hangzhou Local Court on June 1st. The County Public Security Bureau dispatched police to escort him to Shaoxing, where he was to be handed over by the Shaoxing Local Branch Court to the County Public Security Bureau for transfer to Yuyao. However, near Gaobu, several robbers suddenly appeared, wielding pistols and snatching the bandit away. One policeman was killed and another injured on the spot.</p>
<p>District Offices Urge Payment of Autonomous Household Donations: District offices in Xiaoshan County have all been established, and their funding is mostly borrowed. County Magistrate Du had previously requested the Department of Civil Affairs to approve the collection of autonomous household donations from villages and neighborhoods, stipulating that 20% be extracted for district autonomous funding. Now, because the funding for the established district offices is awaiting disbursement, orders have been issued to urge villages and neighborhoods that have already handled autonomous household donations to quickly send the donation money to the county for review and reconciliation. Those who have not collected the donations should collect them according to regulations.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Public Organizations Jointly Telegram for Troops: The Hefei County Party Department, Chamber of Commerce, Finance and Education Bureaus, and various legal organizations, citing the discovery of over a thousand bandits and communists in the southwestern Shannan Pavilion area and the urgency of city defense, held a joint meeting at the Chamber of Commerce last night. It was decided to request troops for defense and suppression and to send telegrams to Acting Provincial Chairman Wang and Wei Lihuang, Commander of the Northern Anhui Garrison in Bengbu, urging them to quickly dispatch troops to Hefei to maintain order.</p>

<h3>Athletes from North and South Returned Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Zhang Boling Striving to Make Nankai Sports a Model for All Schools: South China Athletes Will Work Hard After Returning to Hong Kong to Wipe Away Previous Humiliation: Dr. Zhang Boling led several Nankai basketball players on the Fengtian Maru at 9:00 AM yesterday to return. Hao Boyang, a representative of the National Committee of YMCAs of China, went to see them off. Before departing, Zhang told people that he would strive to build Nankai sports into a model for all schools. The South China male and female athletes also took the original Longtian Maru back to Hong Kong yesterday. Their leaders, Mo Yinghui and Qiu Jixiang, were deeply moved by their experience in Japan. After returning to Hong Kong, they will awaken the local people to work together and make an early determination to maintain the volleyball championship and regain the football honor in the next games. There is also a considerable development plan for swimming.</p>
<h3>Reasons for China's Failure at the Far Eastern Games</h3>
<p>Football Team's Lineup Not Well-Organized, Basketball Team Also Lacked Coordination, Track and Field Athletes Exerted Great Effort, Baseball and Swimming Are Japan's Specialties: Interviews with Chinese Team Officials: (Qian Hua)</p>
<p>China can be said to have completely failed at this Far Eastern Games. The total defeat in track and field was expected. As for the rest, such as football, which had held the Far Eastern championship for seven consecutive terms, surprisingly drew with Japan this time, retaining the championship. Tianjin-Beijing basketball, which was watched by the whole country, was defeated repeatedly this time, suffering a setback and falling to the bottom, which was beyond the expectations of ordinary people. Although they luckily won the runner-up, in terms of strength, they are not as good as the Philippines. If they do not work hard and the whole country unites to wipe out the shame, then China will never have a place in the Far Eastern Games. The reporter was sent to participate in this grand event and witnessed the tragic state of failure. After careful consideration, I visited the coaches of our country and asked about the reasons for the failure and their opinions on the strengths of Japan and the Philippines. They are introduced in sections below, which may also serve as a lesson for the people of our country to know how to encourage themselves. (1) Track and Field Race</p>
<h3>Ma Yuehan's Opinion</h3>
<p>Regarding track and field, Japan's rapid progress is truly amazing and admirable. The Philippine athletes, who have always been known for short-distance running, were also defeated by the Japanese this time. Moreover, the records in pole vaulting and long jumping are close to world records. Our country's ragtag army has not had time to train, so its failure is justified. The reporter visited Mr. Ma Yuehan, the head coach of track and field, and asked for his opinion. He said that since 1927, Japan has been practicing hard, enduring hardships, and working hard, which has led to today's achievements. It is unreasonable for our country to try to win by luck. However, the achievements of our country's athletes in the Games have broken their personal domestic records, which is enough to prove their fighting spirit. This point is worthy of self-consolation. Moreover, Li Zhongsan's high jump, Situ Guang's triple jump, Zhao Rugong's long jump, and Cao Yu's pole vault were only trained formally in Shanghai for more than a month. Li Zhongsan increased from 1.70 meters to 1.80 meters, and Situ Guang increased to 13.70 meters. The rest, such as Mai Guozhen's 400-meter result of 51.5 seconds, also had significant progress. It can be seen that China is not without geniuses or good coaches. With scientific methods and continuous practice, I am convinced that if we can pay attention to this point and work hard in the future, although we cannot immediately say that we will win Japan's championship in four years, it can be said that we will gain a considerable position. If we continue to hold the Buddha's feet at the last minute as before, and only start practicing when there are sports games, then there is no doubt that the track and field race will continue to maintain a score of zero. (2) Football</p>
<h3>Li Huitang's Remarks</h3>
<p>The failure of China's football and basketball teams this time is generally blamed on the unfairness of the Japanese referees, but the reporter believes that the progress of Japanese technology and the degradation of our country is the biggest reason. The referee's remarks are not fatal. Football star Mr. Li Huitang did not participate in this game due to a foot disease. The reporter returned to Shanghai with him on the same ship and talked for a long time. Li said that the performance of our country's football team this time was not very good. The forwards lacked communication and lacked a leader. Therefore, they were like a plate of loose sand and lost the opportunity to attack the enemy. In the final of the Sino-Japanese football match, fortunately, Li Tiansheng was the defender and Zhou Xianyan was the goalkeeper, otherwise they would have lost several more goals. The Japanese team has made extraordinary progress in running and kicking. The forwards also have good communication, but unfortunately, they have not been able to fully understand the internal essence of football, so they show weaknesses when attacking the goal and are not easy to score. I am sure that if the lineup of the Chinese team is slightly more organized in the future, it will be easy to win. Li's words were quite confident. We should wait and see what happens four years from now. (3) Basketball</p>
<h3>Dong Shouyi's Talk</h3>
<p>The fact that our country's basketball team lost all four games is indeed beyond the imagination of people in the country. The reporter asked Mr. Dong Shouyi, the coach of the team, when he was in Japan. According to him, the first reason for the team's failure was that they were too excited and had no composure when fighting. They were too eager to win, and when they lost a few points, they desperately counterattacked, causing the lineup to be chaotic and giving the enemy an opportunity to take advantage of them. This was the case in all four games, which affected the cooperation in passing and the accuracy of throwing the ball. Overall, the performance of our team was not as good as 60% of the time in Hangzhou, so how could they not fail? The second reason is that the domestic praise was too high, and the whole team was very confident. Unexpectedly, they were defeated by Japan in the first game. Due to the sense of responsibility, they were too eager to win, which directly led to a very excited state and could not be remedied. The third reason is the unfairness of the referee. I repeatedly watched the Sino-Japanese and Philippine basketball games. They did not punish the Japanese side for (walking) at all, but they monitored the Chinese and Philippine sides very strictly. The Japanese side scored points because of this. Moreover, because our team had no composure, they were penalized several times on the court and became very flustered. In the panic, they were unaware of the enemy's tricks. It is a pity. On the other hand, the Filipinos were able to remain calm and reverse the defeat in the end. From the perspective of this session's strength, the Philippines is the best. China and Japan have their own advantages and disadvantages in skills. It is not certain that China is inferior to Japan.

<h3>Xu Zhendong's Words</h3>
<p>Baseball is Japan's national sport. Even a three-foot-tall child knows how to play it, so its victory is justified. As for swimming, due to environmental reasons, our country is still in its infancy, so there is no competition. The reporter talked with Mr. Xu Zhendong about tennis in China and Japan. Xu said that Japanese tennis players are afraid of soft balls but not hard balls, so Lin Baohua is not as good as Qiu Feihai. The doubles of Lin and Qiu had a chance of winning, but unfortunately, the weather did not help us. The last hit went out of bounds and unfortunately hit Lin's chest, so they failed. There are many tennis talents in Japan, and there are opportunities for competition, so it is easier for them to improve their skills. On the other hand, if there are very few opponents in the location of Lin and Qiu, it will be more difficult for them to improve. In the future, China will have very few opportunities in the Far Eastern tennis event. Guangdong No. 1 Women's Normal School Volleyball Team</p>
<h3>Today's Battle Against Wu Ben</h3>
<p>At 5:00 PM at the Chinese Athletic Field, the Guangdong Provincial No. 1 Women's Normal School team, which went north this time, has four teams: volleyball, basketball, tennis, and baseball. They are strong and well-equipped. They are very famous in Guangzhou and have won the volleyball and tennis championships many times. They went north to compete with the elite schools in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to connect and learn from each other. Today at 5:00 PM, a special volleyball match will be held with Wu Ben Girls' School at the Chinese Athletic Field, the place for women's swimming performances. The Wu Ben Girls' School volleyball team is a famous iron army, so there will be a great battle. The lineup of the volleyball team is as follows: First Row, Second Row, Third Row: Liu Huifen, Wu Xiuxian, Deng Zhihao, Wang Chunruo, Lian Ling, Li Cuimei, Liao Siyi, Situ Wei, Lu Yanying, Zhong Runing, Xu Guixin, Li Wenhui.

<h3>A Banquet for the Press Last Night</h3>
<p>The team gave a banquet to the reporters of various newspapers at the East Asia Restaurant at 8:00 PM last night. The team members have two important missions: (1) to actively promote women's sports and unite efforts in various places, and (2) to gain more opportunities to improve their skills through competitions. The success or failure is not counted. Then, Wu Zhiqian, the director of sports, introduced the achievements and positions of each player. Finally, Sun Daosheng replied that the team has only 19 members, but it contains four teams. It is rare to see that nine of them are also athletes attending the Far Eastern Games. Their strength is strong and conceivable. In recent years, teams from the north and south have traveled thousands of miles to challenge Shanghai, but this is the first time that a women's team has come here. It is a pioneer in promoting the cause and is optimistic about the future of women's sports in our country. The meeting ended at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Shanghai Volleyball Association Preliminary Round</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Volleyball Association started the competition yesterday. There are four groups participating, two in Group A and two in Group B. The competition was originally scheduled to be held at the Chinese Athletic Field at 2:00 PM, but was changed to the basketball room due to rain. The competition was fierce and there were many spectators. The results of each group are recorded below: Xi Ping won against Hei Teng (B) by 2-0. Black Eagle abstained. Fu Guang won against San Yi (B) 21-7, 8-21, 21-5. Da Xia won against Xing Guang (A) 21-3, 21-11. Nan Shi won against Pu Guang (A) 21-9, 21-16. Among the games in each group, the battle between Nan Shi and Pu Guang in Group A was the most exciting and tense. Nan Shi is a well-known Fudan University team that won the Far Eastern Games volleyball championship. Cao Tingzan, the main player of the Chinese team, is also in the team, so its strength is strong and it is worthy of being called the hegemon of Jiangnan. The team is the most confident of winning the championship in this league. The Pu Guang team is also a strong team in Shanghai. It is the strongest team besides Nan Shi, but unfortunately, it met its strong opponent, the Nan Shi team, in the preliminary round and was badly defeated, resulting in its elimination. It is a pity. However, the performance has reached a wonderful level and has been praised by the audience. The second game was particularly fierce. Cao Tingzan's kill in Nan Shi is truly rare. The lineups of both sides are as follows: Nan Shi Team: First Row, Second Row, Third Row: Chen Shijing, Wu Changfa, Li Fujun, Cheng Mingjue, Cao Tingzan, Zhao Binglin, Lin Zhaorong, Xie Baochang, Wen Tianpeng. Pu Guang Team: Liu Peichang, Weng Yanyun, Tang Ximin, Chen Baoqiu, Mai Fengtang, Xiao Jingbo, Wei Zuohan, Guan Ruian, Huang Yuhui.

<h3>Fifth Day of Tennis Competition</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai Played with Injury...Unfortunate Defeat in Doubles::Japan Wins Tennis Championship::Two Lis Showed Their Power...Defeated the Japanese::</p>
<h3>(1) Men's Doubles</h3>
<p>Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua lost to 2-6 Yamagishi and Shima. Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua lost to 2-6 Yamagishi and Shima. Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua lost to 7-5 Yamagishi and Shima. Qiu Feihai and Lin Baohua lost to 6-8 Yamagishi and Shima. (Tokyo Communication) On the 28th, Qiu Feihai suffered a leg cramp due to excessive running in the singles competition. He had to give up the game due to his injury. On the morning of the 8th, the drizzle did not stop, as if the sky was as people wished, giving Qiu a time to rest. Unexpectedly, the weather turned fine in the afternoon. At 2:30 PM, Qiu still wore his injury and went to the court with Lin Baohua to play. Although Qiu was full of energy, he still felt pain in his steps. When he entered the arena, he received enthusiastic cheers from the audience. At the beginning of the first game, Lin served first and won a set with a score of four to two. After that, the Japanese side gained the advantage. Yamagishi performed very well and repeatedly used kill shots to win. Afterwards, the Japanese side gained the advantage. Yamagishi repeatedly used kill shots. Qiu used his strength to hit the ball low and fast, and the Japanese were at a loss. We won a set. In the eighth set, Shima served with strength and accuracy, and our return ball repeatedly went out of bounds, so we lost another set. The first game also ended here (six to two). After the Japanese won a set, their momentum was strong. At the beginning of the second game, they won three consecutive sets. In these three sets, Shima made many mistakes, but our side was not energetic, and even the easy balls could not be returned over the net. Then, our side won two consecutive sets with a score of four to two and four to one. After that, our side saw the enemy approaching the net and changed to a feinting strategy, sending the ball high to the rear of the enemy, but it was repeatedly intercepted by the enemy near the net, so we lost three consecutive sets and lost again with a score of six to two. In the third game, Lin and Qiu fought fiercely. It was the most exciting scene in the entire competition. At the beginning, Lin lost two points near the net and lost a set. Our country did not show weakness and quickly caught up and won two sets. Our second set was won by the equal efforts of Lin and Qiu. Qiu defended the rear and used Kuixiao's smash. Lin was in charge of the front and used skillful shooting. After that, from the fourth set, they chased each other up and down, step by step. The referee made several mistakes, making our country more disadvantaged. Until the eleventh set, our country won a set with a score of four to one. Later, Lin and Qiu suddenly stepped forward at the same time, taking the Japanese side by surprise and attacking fiercely, and then won another set, winning with a score of seven to five. In the fourth game, the Japanese side won the game early and was unwilling to take it lightly, so they were very cautious in both offense and defense. Lin and Qiu were also determined to recover the remaining game and attacked fiercely. They won a set first. By the third set, they won two and lost one. After the fourth set, our country lost three consecutive sets. Then, they saw the turning point of the ball and lost completely in the ninth set without winning a single ball. We took the lead with one set, and the score was five to four. However, in the long and fierce battle, Qiu was very selfless, so his spirit suddenly appeared tired. Therefore, in the following five sets, our country only won one set and ended up losing to Japan for the third time with a score of eight to six. Since the fierce battle in the doubles, our country lost with a result of three to one, and the tennis championship was decided to be won by Japan. Japan had already won the Philippines before, and it has won three of the five games against our country. Even if our side wins both of the singles games tomorrow, we will not be able to have any hope of winning the championship. Looking at today's battle, Qiu's performance was excellent, but due to yesterday's injury, he was unable to exert his full strength. Lin's skills were very good, but many of the skillful shots he made yesterday failed. It is a pity that our side missed more high balls.</p>
<h3>(2) Women's Doubles</h3>
<p>Li Xinghua and Li Mudan 6-4 Mrs. Asabuki and Kobayashi Li Xinghua and Li Mudan 3-6 Mrs. Asabuki and Kobayashi Li Xinghua and Li Mudan 7-5 Mrs. Asabuki and Kobayashi The doubles match between the two Lis and Mrs. Asabuki and Ms. Kobayashi was very exciting and a battle of tactics. Teams that are not well-trained cannot have such a good performance. The two Lis on our side still used their usual conservative skills to wait for work. The Japanese side, Mrs. Asabuki in the front and Kobayashi in the back, implemented their straight-line offensive and defensive tactics. After the start of the first game, Mrs. Asabuki took advantage of our unpreparedness and attacked fiercely in the front, repeatedly scoring points with skillful shots. Ms. Li knew that she could not win with skill, so she focused on attacking the rear of the enemy and using the strategy of avoiding the solid and attacking the empty, attacking Ms. Kobayashi in the same direction, making Ms. Kobayashi run around in the rear, sweating profusely and finding it difficult to support. Mrs. Asabuki was like a puppet and could not get a single ball. The whole court was almost the world of three people. Finally, our side won the first game with a score of six to four. At the beginning of the second game, the Japanese side also changed its tactics. Mrs. Asabuki retreated to the rear and stood side by side with Kobayashi to attack fiercely. Our side won two sets first, and then lost five consecutive sets. After that, each side won one set, and our side lost the second game with a score of three to six. In this game, Mrs. Asabuki had a slight chance to catch the ball, but she was not used to defending and had no good performance. Ms. Li Mudan's ball-saving skills were very good, and Ms. Li Xinghua's offense was stronger. At the beginning of the third game, Mrs. Asabuki made more and more mistakes. She could not reach the near balls and all the far balls fell to the net. Our country advanced strongly and took the lead with a score of four to two. After that, Mrs. Asabuki became more and more tired and had almost no advantages to speak of. When China won with a score of five to two, Kobayashi performed better and the situation turned around, but it was still difficult to match the skills of the two Lis. Finally, the Japanese side lost with a score of seven to five.</p>
<h3>End of Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>China Loses Again to Japan in Two Singles Matches, China and Japan Each Win a Singles Match (Tokyo Dispatch) In the first day of the China-Japan tennis tournament, Lin Baohua lost to Japan's Sato. Qiu Feihai withdrew from his match against Buji due to a foot injury. In the second day's doubles, Lin and Qiu were defeated by Japan's Yamagishi and Shimura team. Japan having won three matches, the championship is already within their grasp. Today, the third day (29th), the final two singles matches will still be held according to the original schedule, but there is no possibility of China regaining the championship. Today, China's Lin Baohua faced Buji. Lin's momentum was very strong, winning the first set outright. Subsequently, Lin repeatedly failed, especially in drop shots. Buji won three sets in a row. Lin then won the fifth and seventh sets. Finally, Buji powerfully smashed the ball, winning the eighth and ninth sets, thus winning the first game six to three. In the second game, Lin initially lost a set, then took the lead two to one. By the sixth game, he had an advantage, leading four to two. Unexpectedly, the situation suddenly changed, with Lin failing to score points frequently. Therefore, even though Buji repeatedly hit the ball out of bounds, he still won four sets in a row. Lin lost the second game four to six. At the beginning of the third game, Lin was still able to maintain his composure and his smashes were quite steady. At the end of the sixth game, he was leading four to two. After that, his strength seemed to wane slightly. Lin was unable to defend against Buji's incoming balls, and lost the seventh, eighth, ninth, and fourth sets in a row. Lin lost another game. Following the Lin-Buji match, Qiu Feihai was originally scheduled to face Sato, but Qiu's foot injury had not fully healed. After yesterday's doubles match, walking was quite difficult, and there was also an open competition today where he had to partner with Lin, so he had no choice but to withdraw again. Thus, the 9th Grand Tennis Championship concluded. China lost to Japan five to zero. Japan defeated both China and the Philippines, and won this championship. Lin Baohua 3-6 Buji Lin Baohua 4-6 Buji Lin Baohua 4-6 Buji The women's open competition also concluded. Today's women's matches were between Ms. Li Mudan and Ms. Kobayashi, and Ms. Li Xinghua and Ms. Iimura. Li Mudan's performance today was lacking. From beginning to end, she only defended and did not attack. She continued to lose eleven games in the first two sets. She luckily won the twelfth game, but then lost the thirteenth game and the entire game. Li Mudan 0-6 Li Mudan 1-6 The match between Ms. Xinghua and Ms. Iimura was indeed skillful. In the first set, Ms. Li Xinghua seemed quite flustered. Her usually steady ball return was completely ineffective, leading to a four to six loss. At the beginning of the second set, Ms. Li gradually returned to her former state, and her ball return was extremely skillful. Iimura ran back and forth in the back, gradually showing signs of fatigue. Finally, Ms. Li regained a game with seven to five. In the third set, Ms. Li felt even more energetic, and Ms. Li returned the ball wherever it came. Iimura became even more exhausted, and Ms. Li won two sets in the whole game. Ms. Li won with six to two. Li Xinghua 4-6 Iimura Li Xinghua 7-5 Iimura Li Xinghua 6-2 Iimura Men's Open Exhibition Doubles The men's open exhibition was Lin and Qiu versus Sato and Kawachi. Both sides had equal skills. Qiu's performance was better, and his drop shots were especially effective. Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai 6-4 Sato and Kawachi Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai 5-7 Sato and Kawachi Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai 1-6 Sato and Kawachi Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai 6-0 Sato and Kawachi Lin Baohua and Qiu Feihai 1-6 Sato and Kawachi</p>
<h3>Philippines Wins Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>Japan-Philippines Third Match: 45 to 40, Philippines Wins; Japanese Referees are Extremely Unscrupulous (Tokyo Dispatch) In the Far Eastern Games basketball competition, Japan and the Philippines both had two wins, and each had a draw with China. Therefore, the final match was held at 7:30 pm on the 30th. At the beginning of the first half, the Japanese team was quite active, and their coordination was very good. Initially, Ohashi scored a goal from the left side, and the score was opened. Before long, the Japanese team created an eight to zero lead. The Philippine team tried hard to catch up, reaching thirteen to eight. At the ten-minute mark, they were only one point behind, with a score of thirteen to twelve. After that, both sides had opportunities to shoot, but both were inaccurate. During this time, the Philippine team once took the lead by one point. At the fifteen-minute mark, the Philippine team scored a goal from the center of the court. Then, Ohashi scored four goals alone under the Philippine basket. The Japanese team took the lead again. The final score was twenty-two to eighteen. The Japanese team led by four points in the first half. In the second half, the Japanese team initially had a smooth run. Before a minute had passed, Ohashi penetrated into enemy territory, received a ball from Ueda, and turned to score. Kobayashi, Tanaka, and others rushed forward as soon as they got the ball, and passed it to the forwards. The Japanese team repeatedly scored points because of this. Before long, the difference became as large as twenty-nine to twenty. At this time, both teams were trying to win quickly. The Philippine team repeatedly protested the referee's calls. As the Philippine team was successively penalized, the Japanese team took the opportunity to advance further. Ueda, Tanaka, Kobayashi, and the Philippines' Loroppo and Fu Leimei each scored, but at the ten-minute mark, the Japanese team still had a thirty-six to twenty-nine lead. In the last ten minutes, the Philippine team attacked desperately. Although they were repeatedly penalized for no reason, which increased the Japanese team's score, the Philippine team of five had the determination to burn their boats. They coordinated and attacked in one go. Between the thirteenth and fifteenth minutes, they scored five goals in a row, making the score thirty-nine to thirty-five. The overall situation reversed. The Japanese team was at a disadvantage everywhere, but Nomura still scored two goals, taking the lead at one point, with each side scoring thirty-nine points. In the last two minutes, the Philippine team used a bait-and-switch tactic, first luring the enemy out, and then using one person alone to enter the enemy area and score two goals in a row. As a result, they won the championship with a total score of forty-five to forty. Number of Penalties: 1 3 2 4 0 0 1 1 1 Points Scored: 4 6 5 2 0 4 4 5 1 1 4 Philippine Team Forwards: {Zilezi, Fu Leimei Center: {Solopopo, Poliya Guards: {Liero, Solao, Solirio, Na Wuya Japanese Team Forwards: {Hashimura, Ueda, Ohno, Ii, Ue Center: {Nakaida, Oh Guards: {Hayashi, Tokutei, Ko Kenshi, Oh Number of Penalties: 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 2 Points Scored: 4 4 3 4 1 0 4 0 0 0 1 1 4 In summary, the Japanese team's strength was far below the Philippine team's, but the Philippine team's shooting was not as accurate as in the previous matches. Not long after the start of the match, the Philippine team was repeatedly penalized. In the first half, there were a total of seven penalties. The Japanese team's obvious charges were not penalized even once. In the first ten minutes of the second half, there were few penalty calls, but the Philippine team's ball was repeatedly judged to belong to the Japanese team for various reasons, giving the Japanese team many advantages. After the Philippine team worked hard to catch up to the same level, the referees used their tricks again and repeatedly called penalties. They even penalized the Philippine team twice on the pretext of slower serving. It can be seen how unscrupulous they were. Looking at the record, the number of penalties for the Philippine team was eleven, while the Japanese team only had two. One of them was even a declaration of ceasefire. The points scored by the two sides from free throws after being penalized four or more times were ten for Japan and only one for the Philippines. It can be seen what the real strength of both sides was and who should have won the championship. The fact that the Philippines was penalized eleven times cannot be regarded as too many, but what is unsatisfactory is that the Japanese team only had one penalty. In such a fierce and crucial basketball match, no matter how good the ball skills are, there is no way to only commit one foul. It can be seen that the Japanese referees have no personality. What is even more outrageous is that a certain referee, Tanaka, declared that the Philippine team had committed a foul. After the Philippine captain protested for a long time, the referee cancelled the previous call. Such a fickle action actually happened in the grand Far Eastern Games. The Japanese people's cleverness turned into clumsiness, and they lost their national integrity. No wonder even their own people cursed them.</p>

<h3>Departure of the Central Asia Survey Team</h3>
<p>Departed Yesterday, Returning to Beiping in November The agreement draft previously agreed upon by the Beiping Antiquities Preservation Committee and the Central Asia Survey Team of the American Museum of Natural History in New York was approved by the Ministry of Education for record. The Antiquities Preservation Committee has now submitted the names of the team leader and members to the Ministry of Education, as well as the departure location and time. The general idea of the Ministry of Education is that the Chinese team leader and members must be geological and paleontological experts, so they have been carefully selected and decided to appoint Zhang Xiti, professor of geology at Guangzhou Sun Yat-sen University, as the Chinese team leader, and Yang Zhongjian, technician of the Geological Survey Institute, and Fei Wenzhong, investigator of the Geological Survey Institute, as the Chinese team members. They will depart with the American team leader. The time is scheduled for May 26th. They will depart from Zhangjiakou by car and take the Kulun Avenue to Chitu Yin Usu, 130 miles north of Zhangjiakou. The Swedish classroom will be used as a camel team to study the desert area from Doron north to the northern Mongolian border. They will then return to Chitu Yin Usu around the end of July. Some of them will return to Beiping to replenish their luggage and then go to Uur Obo, 300 miles northwest of Zhangjiakou, to continue the work that was not completed last year. The whole team will return to Beiping at the end of October or November. This is the current planned plan.

<h3>Urging the Submission of Monthly Work Reports from All Schools</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's order urging the submission of monthly work reports to the provincial middle schools states: The previous order from the Provincial Government to forward the monthly work report forms to the affiliated departments for filing in the department has been issued and followed, and it has been stipulated that the report for the first month should be sent before the 10th of the second month. Now, after checking, the school has not sent any reports since being notified. As an educational institution to promote culture, it must abide by the orders and inspect diligence and laziness without the need for repeated orders.

<h3>Jiangsu Farmers' Two Colleges Renamed</h3>
<p>Renamed (Jiangsu Provincial College of Education) The two colleges, the Labor and Farmers' College and the Public College, located in Wuxi, are difficult to determine the appropriate status in the academic system after the promulgation of the University Organization Law. However, since the two colleges were established in 1928 and the new University Organization Law was promulgated in July 1929, the Ministry of Education believes that the graduates of this session of the college can still be handled as before. From 1930, the two colleges will be merged into an independent college named Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, divided into the Labor and Farmers' College and the Public College, in accordance with Article 4 of the University Organization Law.

<h3>Meeting on Stabilization of Gold and Silver Prices</h3>
<p>There are plans for two measures to be submitted to the government for deliberation. Because our country has traditionally adopted the silver standard, domestic industry and commerce, as well as importers, have been on the verge of crisis since the rise of gold and the decline of silver. Ministers Kong and Song are deeply concerned about this. Therefore, they came to Shanghai one after another to discuss solutions with the banking community. Yesterday, at the Ministry of Finance office, a meeting was convened with the banking community and experienced merchants. After thorough consideration, it was determined that with the soaring price of gold showing no signs of stopping, the price of silver would inevitably continue to fall. Now is the time to seek ways to curb the price of gold, so that the price of silver can gradually stabilize. Ministers Kong and Song will present two proposed measures for joint discussion: (1) to curb speculation in the gold market; (2) all imported silver bullion from foreign banks will be handled by the Central Bank. Attendees generally agreed that while the first measure might seem extreme, it may be necessary to implement it when needed. They also unanimously supported the idea that having the state bank handle silver bullion imports is a common practice in Europe and America. However, it is said that Ministers Song and Kong, for the sake of prudence, still need to go to the capital to submit it to the government for approval before it can be implemented.

<p>Supervisor's Speech</p>
<p>Today, Magistrate Yan is holding a supplementary oath-taking ceremony. Brother Ke is honored to represent the Provincial Department in participating. It is thought that now, when civil servants take office, they all take an oath, but there are very few who can act in accordance with the oath from beginning to end. The biggest reason is that there are too many people employed and the funding is insufficient, so corruption and malfeasance occur. Therefore, caution must be exercised in employing people. This is one of my key contributions. As for the layer of obedience to the Party doctrine, Magistrate Yan has served in Party affairs for a long time and has a deep understanding and history of the Party. I am confident that there will be no problems. Shanghai is the focus of attention both domestically and internationally, and it is also the center of the revolution. Those without a revolutionary history cannot be competent. Now that Magistrate Yan is here, the Provincial Government can rest assured.</p>
<p>Speech by the County Party Representative</p>
<p>Today, representing the Party Committee to participate in the ceremony, I have a few words of hope for Magistrate Yan. Shanghai is the focus of attention both domestically and internationally and is very important. Since our Party came to Shanghai, the county magistrate has changed repeatedly, and nothing has been achieved. The reasons are very complex, the biggest one being financial difficulties, especially since the separation of the city and county. However, officials in the Party government should have the will to endure hardship and overcome these difficulties. Magistrate Yan has not yet arrived in Shanghai, but we already have a good understanding of him. His learning, morality, and everything else make us admire him. He has also achieved great success in Party work. We are very happy and comforted that he has come to lead Shanghai, and we know that he will be able to solve all the current difficulties in Shanghai. We hope that Magistrate Yan will work hard to build Shanghai into a model and not disappoint the people of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Speeches by Guests</p>
<p>(1) Chu Fucheng said briefly: I came to participate in Mr. Yan's inauguration ceremony today. I just heard the words of the supervisor and the Party representative. I have been a long-time friend with Magistrate Yan in terms of personal relationship and a long-time comrade in the Party. His life is very simple. I can guarantee that Magistrate Yan will be able to fulfill his oath. He has come to lead Shanghai this time to work for the Party and the country, and he has long served as the chief writer for newspapers, often criticizing all administrative officials with a fair eye. Now that he has come to serve as county magistrate, standing in a position to be criticized, he already understands how things should be done and how things are wrong. The position of county magistrate is extremely important. We must advocate using good people to be county magistrates, and then politics will gradually become clear. Mr. Shen Hengshan once served as the Secretary-General of the National Assembly and was highly qualified, but he repeatedly expressed his willingness to serve as a county magistrate and hoped that his friends would come to serve as county magistrates, because the position of county magistrate is extremely important.</p>
<p>(2) Shen Junru said briefly: I just heard Mr. Chu's words, and I am determined to serve as a county magistrate. I believe that the county magistrate is an important official and the most important administrative official. The county magistrate is close to the people and must go to the people every day instead of sitting in the yamen to handle affairs. To be a county magistrate, one must first have experience, second, have morality, and third, have common sense. Secondly, one must also be clear about Party doctrine, and then one can handle county administration effectively. Magistrate Yan now possesses all of these qualities. We only hope that Magistrate Yan will go to the people every day to do things for the people. Secondly, I believe that the first thing a county magistrate should do now is to raise the qualifications. All those who have served as members of the Central Committee, members of the Provincial Government, or directors of departments should also come to serve as county magistrates. The second thing is to raise the salary, because if the county magistrate cannot solve his own livelihood, he cannot talk about relieving the suffering of the people. My interest in county magistrates has not diminished to this day. I am planning to write a book called "On County Magistrates," and I hope that Magistrate Yan will provide materials based on his experience in the future.</p>
<p>(3) Pan Gongzhan said briefly: I just heard what a few people said. I am also an old friend of Magistrate Yan and deeply know that his learning, talent, spirit, and morality are enough to benefit the local area. In addition, Magistrate Yan has gained the trust of the Provincial Government. He will definitely be able to do a good job in leading Shanghai this time. However, because the county magistrate system still has shortcomings, I dare not believe that Magistrate Yan will definitely be able to do a good job in Shanghai's county administration. Even now, the county magistrate does not have considerable authority within a county. Although the names of the various bureaus below the county government belong to the county government, in fact, each bureau is directly appointed by its responsible department. They cooperate with the county government when they are happy, and they talk to their responsible department when they are unhappy.</p>
<p>If there is something wrong, the county magistrate cannot directly intervene. In this way, the command is not clear. Even if there is a good county magistrate, it is difficult to achieve good results. Even if there are one or two county magistrates who can cooperate with the various bureaus, this is only accidental and not a systematic advantage. Therefore, I feel that the current county organization needs to be revised in fact. At least the directors of each bureau must be selected by the county magistrate from those who have passed the examination in the Provincial Department and recommended to the Department for appointment in order to cooperate in handling affairs. Therefore, I hope that Magistrate Yan will be able to faithfully report such difficulties when he feels them in the future so that the county organization can be improved as soon as possible, which will benefit the counties across the country.</p>
<p>(4) Yu Hongjun, representative of the Municipal Government, said briefly: I am honored to represent the Municipal Government to participate in Magistrate Yan's supplementary oath-taking ceremony today. Although I am not familiar with Magistrate Yan, I have long heard that he is a good reporter. The conditions that a good reporter must have are profound knowledge, a great personality, and quick judgment. If a good reporter is appointed to county affairs, he will naturally be able to gradually reform the bad things in the local area and make politics tend to be good. This is a point of contribution that I felt when participating in the ceremony today.</p>
<p>(5) Chen Dezheng said briefly: I feel very honored to participate in Magistrate Yan's supplementary oath-taking ceremony today. I think that Magistrate Yan, who came from a newspaper, can implement everything with a policy of austerity and pay attention to practical work when handling political work. This is one of his advantages. Now that Mr. Yan has come to lead Shanghai County, his actions and attitude show no officialdom habit, and he will naturally be able to meet with the people frankly and seek happiness for the people. This is also one of his advantages. Brother and Mr. Yan are old colleagues, so I will introduce these advantages to everyone.</p>
<p>Oath-taking Ceremony of Yan Shenyu, Magistrate of Shanghai County (Photo by Wang Kai)</p>
<p>Magistrate Yan's Reply Speech</p>
<p>I, Shenyu, have been ordered to act as the magistrate of Shanghai County. Today, I am holding a supplementary oath-taking ceremony. I am honored by the guidance of the representative of the Provincial Government, the representative of the County Party Committee, all the seniors, and the guests. I dare not accept all the commendations. I will keep all the encouragements in mind. Since Shanghai separated the city and county, although the area is smaller than before, I feel that the responsibility is still very heavy. Every revolutionary comrade should guard against the danger of falling into corruption and deterioration, but I deeply feel that the most corrupt people in the world are those who do not do their duty, and the most deteriorated people in the world are those who seek personal gain by virtue of their position. No matter how big or small the matter is, the need to do one's duty and the loyalty to one's duties are the same, but I believe that in order to avoid these two dangers, there are two Chinese idioms that are really the right medicine, that is, "diligence can make up for clumsiness, and frugality can cultivate integrity." Although these two words are often heard, since I am aware of my weakness, I must work harder. For example, others can deal with it with 50% effort, but I will deal with it with 100% effort. It is bound to be more able to fulfill its duties. Only by being frugal and self-disciplined can we be a guarantee of integrity and not seek personal gain by virtue of our position. Shenyu will be mindful of this in the future.</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Received Foreign Guests Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting has recently recovered from a long illness, and many matters have been accumulated. He went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss daily official documents at around 9 a.m. yesterday morning. At around 10 a.m., he met with Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi, who explained the reasons for his suspension of returning to his country. At 10:45 a.m., he met with Belgian Chargé d'Affaires Hualuosi and Attaché Xiwikeluo for a long time. At 12:00 p.m., Zhang Boling, the general representative of our country attending the Far Eastern Games, visited. In total, there were more than 20 Chinese and foreign guests who went to see Wang at that place yesterday morning. It was past noon, and Wang felt quite tired. British Chargé d'Affaires Yinggelan wanted to meet with him, but Wang was unable to receive him. He specially sent Director Chen Shiguang to visit the British Consulate to convey Ying's opinions.</p>
<h3>Wang Jiazhen Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Wang Jiazhen, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, urgently needs to discuss important public affairs with Foreign Minister Wang and participate in today's banquet hosted by Director Diao Minqian to report on the truth of diplomacy and the current situation to the press. Therefore, he took the night train to Shanghai last night and arrived at 7 a.m. this morning. Central Committee member Lin Sen was also on the same train.</p>
<h3>Minister Zhang to Chile Leaves by Ship</h3>
<p>Zhang Lü'ao, the minister of our country stationed in Chile, South America, has now been ordered to go to South America to take up his new post. Because there are no direct ships in Shanghai, Minister Zhang, along with Secretary Zhou Jingnian and his family, first went to Shanghai from Beijing and then took a ship to Japan. After arriving in Kobe, he will transfer to another ship. Yesterday, this port received a wireless message from Minister Zhang on the ship, saying that he would arrive in Toyo today. Because he had already reserved a guest seat on the Anyang Maru of the Japan Mail Steamship Company in Shanghai when he set off, he was scheduled to transfer ships from Kobe on Tuesday and go directly to the port of Vlpasaaiso in South America. It is estimated that the sea voyage will take 57 days, and he will arrive around August 2.</p>
<h3>Records of Contemporary Figures' Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Liu Luyin took a train to Beijing last night.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen took the early train to Songjiang at 7 a.m. this morning.</p>
<p>Zhang Boling, who attended the 9th Far Eastern Games, returned home on the Longtian Maru and took a train to Beijing yesterday for some official business.

<h3>Large Quantity of Silver Bars to be Shipped to England</h3>
<p>It is said that the inventory in Shanghai is too abundant, and this measure is to eliminate excessive supply. According to the Shanghai Times, it is rumored that Mitsui Bank in this port will ship a large quantity of silver bars to London. Yesterday (the 6th), the head of the bank verified that the fundamental reason for the decline in the price of silver in China recently is that there is too much silver in Shanghai. Therefore, it is planned to ship it out to relieve the market. This batch of silver bars has already been ordered, because Mitsui Bank has sold a large number of spot silver positions in London and does not have enough, so it plans to ship a batch to deliver to the customers. The exact number has not yet been determined, but it is approximately close to one million ounces. It is also said that the current price of silver in Shanghai is the lowest in the world. The reason is that the inventories of various banks in this port are too abundant. Commerce has almost stopped due to the unfavorable exchange rate and the war in the country, and foreign silver producers still regard Shanghai as the end point because there is nowhere to sell. Now, if we want to curb this, we should impose a certain control on the entry of spot silver into China. This does not mean that we should absolutely prohibit imports, because China will eventually be a country that uses silver. Once the market turns around, it will be needed. However, if the current silver goods have no way out, then if we continue to allow them to be imported in a steady stream, it will hinder the financial interests of the Chinese people. The so-called "a certain control" does not mean imposing taxes or absolutely prohibiting imports, but implementing a method that can not only ensure that the need for silver is not lacking, but also eliminate the danger of excessive supply. As for the unfavorable reaction that the world market will have after the implementation of control, it is not worth worrying about. The price of silver will continue to decline slightly because of this, but if the price of silver is further reduced, the world's lean silver producers will have no profit to gain, and they will inevitably not be able to maintain the current production volume. If production is reduced and the world's inventory gradually decreases, the silver market can turn around.</p>
<h3>Recent News from Yangtze River China Ships</h3>
<p>Foreign ship fares have not been reduced. This newspaper has reported that the fares of various Yangtze River ships have been reduced. It is now known that although the British and Japanese river ships have agreed to unify the prices of first and second class tickets for the upstream and downstream, they have not reduced the percentage. It is estimated that the first class ship from Shanghai to Hankou is 66 yuan, the second class ship is 52 yuan, the first class ship to Jiujiang is 55 yuan, the second class ship is 44 yuan, the first class ship to Anqing is 44 yuan, the second class ship is 35 yuan, the first class ship to Wuhu is 33 yuan, the second class ship is 26 yuan, the first class ship to Nanjing is 25 yuan, the second class ship is 20 yuan, the first class ship from Hankou to Yichang is 50 yuan, and the second class ship is 40 yuan. Flying Tiger abandons salvage. After the Flying Tiger ship of Sanbei was sunk by a warship on the Jiang'an shore in Hankou at the end of February, the bureau entrusted the Rongchang Ren Factory in this port to salvage it. At that time, it was possible to work due to the small water level. Recently, the water level in Hankou has risen sharply, and the Flying Tiger ship has sunk in the river. The entire ship has no trace of being revealed, and there is no hope of salvage. The bureau has now decided to completely abandon the salvage claim.</p>

<h3>Closing of the First District Price Stabilization Bureau of the County</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County First District Price Stabilization Bureau has been in operation for more than two weeks. The price of rice sold was 220 copper coins per catty, which was 70-80 copper coins lower than the market price. Recently, the price of rice has been rising, and the market price per stone is actually 5 yuan higher, resulting in even more crowding in front of the Price Stabilization Bureau. The director of the bureau, Zhang Yingling, realized that the Price Stabilization funds (totaling 2,000 yuan) were almost exhausted and there were only 102 bags of rice left. It was estimated that they could be sold out in a few days, so it was closed. However, as soon as the news spread, although there was heavy rain in recent days, the villagers came in droves despite the rain. The remaining grain was sold out at once. District Chief Wu and the committee members were deeply worried that there would be no rice to sell to the villagers who had returned from labor and immediately convened a temporary meeting to decide to borrow 100 stones of white rice from nearby rice shops to maintain the market. The excess loss was shared and raised by District Chief Wu and the committee members. Therefore, the villagers who came to sell rice yesterday were still able to return with a full load. It is reported that the bureau held a closing meeting yesterday to audit the accounts and report the expenses. Arsenal Trade Union</p>

It is reported that Zhang Zhenjiang, Wang Panlin, Li Dada, Ju Guangxing, Fang Caitang, Zhu Yongsheng, Zhu Xichen, Chen Linfu, Zhu Yunsheng, and other nine people were sent to Shanghai hospitals for treatment and were sent to the Red Cross on Haige Road for treatment and recuperation. However, Yang Jianchen of Renji Hospital has not yet been discharged from the hospital. The trade union has therefore requested the factory to give preferential treatment to the various articles due to this tragic case. The special investigation is as follows: (1) Increase the death compensation for the deceased. (2) Disabled workers should be protected and supported for life. (3) The children of the deceased workers should be required to be hired as apprentices. (4) Those who have suffered minor injuries should be required to receive consolation medical awards.

<h3>Municipal Government Corrects Chinese Road Contracts</h3>
<p>The road contracts near Shanghai were originally set up for foreigners to permanently lease land. General owners believe that the road contracts have account books and blueprints that can be verified, and that the transfer can be exempted from all taxes at one time. Therefore, they recognize them as reliable and convenient, so they register with foreign firms and convert the square orders into road contracts. This kind of fact can no longer be concealed, so there is an example of Chinese merchants' road contracts. Now, the Municipal Government believes that the road contracts were originally set up for foreigners who cannot have Chinese land rights. If the property belongs to Chinese people, how can they use road contracts in the name of foreigners? It is not enough to protect sovereignty and integrity without vigorously correcting them. Therefore, anyone who uses the name of a Chinese to make any request on the road contract to the Municipal Land Bureau, the Municipal Land Bureau will instruct to cancel the road contract first and change to the land license. This is a gradual correction. yesterday</p>

<h3>Urgent Telegram Requesting the Abolition of the Postal Parcel Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and Postal Employees' Union jointly telegraphed yesterday (details omitted), stating: "For your consideration, the postal parcel tax is unprecedented. During the era of warlord separatism, several provinces, citing the evasion of transit duties by postal parcels, created this tax to raise funds for military expansion. However, there was no complete organization. When our National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the Ministry of Finance followed the old practice, reorganized, and expanded it, establishing special offices to oversee the matter. General bureaus were set up in each province, and branch offices were established in counties and cities, thus establishing the postal parcel tax system. However, since its establishment, over three years have passed, and the malpractices have been countless. Now, we will briefly present them for your examination. When post offices receive and send parcels in major commercial ports, they must go through customs inspection to collect regular taxes, as well as dock and wharf duties, which are already quite substantial. Then, the postal parcel tax bureau adds a 2.5% tax, and when the parcel arrives inland, the local postal parcel tax bureau re-imposes a 2.5% tax. Thus, the same item is taxed multiple times, and merchants suffer greatly. If the inconvenience of repeated inspections by customs and tax bureaus during consignment is considered, that is a minor matter. According to an excerpt in the British Chamber of Commerce Journal of May this year, we urgently translate it for your reference (Finance Minister Song Ziwen stated that the postal parcel tax is not a new tax but a type of transit duty. However, transit duties are not levied on parcels going to and from foreign countries, nor on those going to and from Chinese commercial ports, nor on those going inland and passing through a commercial port. Now, everything is taxed, except for parcels sent from foreign countries to China. Furthermore, this postal parcel tax does not follow customs valuation methods, so it is always higher than customs duties, while the transit duty collected is only half of it. Also, transit duty is only collected once, while postal parcel tax is collected at both the beginning and the end. For example, if a hundred catties of silk are sent from Shanghai to Beijing: (1) If sent by postal parcel, the postage is six yuan and sixty cents, the customs duty is forty-one yuan and forty cents, and the postal parcel tax is nine yuan, totaling fifty-seven yuan. (2) If sent by railway passenger train, the freight is three yuan and ninety-four cents, and the transit duty is seventeen yuan, totaling twenty yuan and ninety-four cents. (3) If sent by railway freight car, the freight is thirty-two cents, and the transit duty is seventeen yuan, totaling seventeen yuan and thirty-two cents. If this kind of bad practice is not abolished, then the fastest and most reliable postal transportation in the country will disappear). Currently, except when unavoidable, most people abandon the post office and switch to other routes for sending parcels. Other transportation agencies charge much lower taxes for transporting the same type of goods along the same route, and the procedures are also simpler. As a result, the number of parcels received and sent by post offices has gradually decreased. Taking Shanghai as an example, before the establishment of the postal parcel tax bureau, the annual revenue of the post office increased year by year. After the establishment of the bureau, the result was the opposite. In 1927, the annual revenue was 1,013,240 pieces, while in March, April, and May of this year, only 192,079 pieces were received. The post office relies heavily on parcels for its revenue, but the postal parcel tax has hindered this, leading to economic contraction and insufficient expenditure. The post office is a profit-generating enterprise for the country, and the postal parcel tax bureau is a tax-collecting agency for the country. Both are under the jurisdiction of the government. Why should there be a distinction? Only by prioritizing the interests of finance and forgetting the harm to transportation is it like cutting flesh from the thigh to mend a wound on the arm. This is a lapse in judgment for even the wise. From this, it can be seen that the postal parcel tax is indeed harmful to merchants and a heavy burden on the post office. It was originally established to compensate for transit duties, but it is merely a disguised form of transit duty. The central government has already declared that transit duties will be abolished from October 10 this year, and the Ministry of Finance also plans to convene a meeting to abolish transit duties on the 10th of this month. Therefore, this disguised form of transit duty, the postal parcel tax, should be abolished uniformly to thoroughly eliminate the bad tax system and abolish redundant agencies at the same time. This matter concerns both tax and postal policies and cannot be ignored. We urge your party department and government to jointly telegraph the Ministry of Finance, urging the transit duty abolition meeting to propose the abolition of the postal parcel tax to relieve the post office's difficulties and alleviate the merchants' hardships. We would be most grateful." Reported by the Social Bureau.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hankou</h3>
<h3>Resumption of Airmail Service</h3>
<p>Starting next week. This port's post office has received a letter from the China Aviation Corporation informing them that the Shanghai-Hankou airplane will resume flights every Monday starting next week. Therefore, the post office will also resume accepting airmail for Shanghai-Hankou every Monday starting next week, and notices have been issued in various post offices. Filipino Youth</p>
<h3>Suicide in a Hostel</h3>
<p>Often visited by women, possibly due to setbacks in love. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, a Filipino youth in a Western-style hostel at 228 Avenue de la Gare, French Concession, suddenly shot himself. The detailed investigation is recorded below:</p>
<p>A Western-style apartment run by a Russian woman named Ms. Skingis was established at 228 Avenue de la Gare, French Concession, which has three floors and a total of seven rooms. It is similar in nature to a common Chinese apartment. The foreigners living there are only for calling out, but although the scale is small, the equipment is complete and the price is very low, so the business is doing well.</p>
<p>On May 31st, a young Filipino customer arrived at the hostel. His face was dark, and he claimed to be from the Philippines, named Torrato, 26 years old. He is currently a platoon leader in the American company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps (i.e., the gold thread of Erdaotou). He rented a room on the third floor with a monthly rent of 28 yuan. He left every day at 7:00 AM in his own car and returned to the hostel around 7:00 PM in good spirits. He has never shown any signs of unhappiness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gunshot was heard. The young man who lived in the hostel often had a woman visit him, and she often stayed for several hours before leaving. The servants didn't think much of it. However, yesterday morning, the young man went out and returned, sitting alone in his room. Around 2:30 PM, a gunshot suddenly occurred in the young man's room, shaking the house. The lodgers in the hostel were shocked and went to investigate. They saw the young man had fallen to the ground in a pool of blood, with a pistol still in his hand. Upon closer inspection, they found that the bullet had entered his right forehead and into his brain.</p>
<p>He died in the hospital. The lodgers examined the situation and knew it was a suicide. At that time, the young man was still able to groan. The owner of the hostel, Russian woman Ms. Skingis, immediately reported it to the police station. The police chief immediately ordered an investigation. They immediately sent his car to the nearby Guangci Hospital on Avenue du Père Huc. Because the injury was to a vital organ, he died immediately upon arrival at the hospital. The body was then sent to the morgue to await today's inquest. According to the speculation of the lodgers, it was mostly due to setbacks in love. At 4:00 PM, the woman who often came finally heard the news and rushed to the scene crying. She said that she currently lived at 226 Rue de Dixmude. The deceased had three children in his family.

<h3>Demanding 10,000 Gold Pieces from a Bank</h3>
<p>Three letters with stern wording. Yan Jinquan was arrested for going to make contact with the newspaper. Since the 21st of last month, a bank on Beijing Road has received three letters sent by the post office. Upon reading them, they learned that they were being extorted by thugs. The extortion letters demanded 10,000 yuan. The bank originally ignored them. However, the wording of the last letter sent the day before yesterday was very stern, ordering someone to go to the corner of Avenue Poincaré and Rue Amiral Bayle to make contact with someone holding a newspaper as a sign. The bank then sent the three letters they had received to the Xinzha Police Station for investigation. The police chief dispatched detective Zhao Qingkui and bank employees Ding Yaokui and tea server Xu Qingxiang at 9:00 PM the night before yesterday. Xu held a newspaper and went to the location as agreed and dispersed around. A Shaoxing man named Yan Jinquan then slowly came to see them. Xu, holding the newspaper, immediately asked if he was the representative of the bank. Xu said yes, and the detectives arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Court for questioning. According to Yan's confession, a friend surnamed Pan, who previously served in the military and is currently unemployed, came to his house last night and asked him to go to the location to contact someone holding a newspaper. He was unaware of the situation and was deceived. Judge Sun approved the police station's request to detain the defendant and reschedule the hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Infanticide Case</h3>
<p>Mother sentenced to twelve years, wife sentenced to six years. Chen Zhangshi, a woman from Suqian living at 1681 Beiyinghua Lane, Rue Robert, Shanghai West, due to her eldest son Chen Mingjian, who was a young man, being a ne'er-do-well addicted to opium, would often violently demand money and squander it at will. If she refused, he would act violently and rebelliously, like a fiend. The woman hated him to the core. She then resolutely discussed it with Mingjian's wife, Chen Zhushi. They agreed that in the middle of the night on the 22nd of last month, when he was fast asleep, Zhangshi would tie Mingjian with a rope, and her daughter-in-law Zhushi would help dispose of the body in the wild. The police discovered it and arrested the mother and daughter-in-law and sent them to the Special District Court for questioning. Zhangshi confessed to killing her son and exonerated her daughter-in-law from conspiracy, assuming all responsibility. Judge Sun Yuan investigated the case to the end and took the seat yesterday morning, ordering the two women to be brought to court and announcing the verdict. Chen Zhangshi was sentenced to twelve years in prison for the crime of premeditated murder. Chen Zhushi was sentenced to six years in prison for the crime of joint murder. The seized hemp rope and carrying pole were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Head of Pirates Escorted from Song to Su Yesterday</h3>
<p>The disturbances caused by sea bandits in various counties outside Wusongkou have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. After the water police and the Qidong County Public Security Bureau carried out a major crackdown, the bandit leader Yang Zhaorong and more than 82 bandits were captured one after another. After the county government interrogated them and submitted them to the provincial authorities, more than 70 people were executed on the spot. Only Yang Zhaorong and four others refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Suzhou High Court. It is now known that the Qidong County Government received the request for extraction the day before yesterday and sent several bailiffs yesterday to escort the four criminals, Yang Zhaorong and others, by small wheel to Wusong Wharf, and then escorted them onto the Songhu train to Shanghai, where they were transferred to the Suzhou High Court for trial.</p>
<h3>He Yanxing's Creditor Group</h3>
<h3>Requesting the Seizure of His Ningbo Property</h3>
<p>He Yanxing, the compradore of the hardware department of Mitsui Yoko, jointly established many businesses in Shanghai, Hankou, Ningbo, Hangzhou, and other ports. This time, due to accumulated losses, he suddenly fled. The stores related to He in various ports either went bankrupt or declared liquidation, and minor ones were also suspended. He's major valuable industries and real estate are in Ningbo, but most of his land and real estate are in Ningbo. Now, the Shanghai financial circles Yichang, Zhengda, Xinfu, Jiufeng, Chengyu Renheng, Henglai, Hengyu, Zhicheng, Henglong, Popular, Hengli and other creditor groups and He's Yuyuan Bank owe the Hongyu and Huiyu hardware stores opened by He more than 200,000 in debt, which is impossible to recover. It is now heard that He has real estate in Ningbo, so it was agreed to engage lawyer Jin Yu to represent all the creditors and publish a warning, which roughly stated: (Hongyu and Huiyu Hardware Stores suddenly went bankrupt the other day, and the owner He Gengxing and the manager have all absconded without a trace. The total debt of the two stores amounts to more than 200,000. We should first request the court to seal up the inventory and property of the two stores for collateral. We have heard that the two stores also owe debts to Ningbo silver and coin firms. It is feared that there are still people among the local firms who have not joined the creditor group. We have found that the owner of the store, He Gengxing, has real estate in Ningbo. It is difficult to guarantee that he will not hide it after the incident and transfer it to others privately. (Omission) It is illegal to hide property. All the owner's real estate in Ningbo, no matter what contract is concluded with others, is invalid. We will send people to Ningbo to investigate the reality of his industry and then submit it to the local authorities to issue a seal to detain it in order to repay the creditors.</p>
<h3>The Reason for the Interruption of Trolley Service in Nanshi Yesterday</h3>
<p>At about 8 a.m. the day before yesterday, a No. 3 trolley bus of the Huashang Trolley Company, traveling from south to north, suddenly had a No. 32 bus of the Shanghai Nanshi Public Bus Company overtake it on the left side from behind at the Yutai Middle School gate at the Dadongmen Station. At the same time, two trolley buses from both sides were also coming from the north. When the drivers on the two trolley buses glanced at the bus rushing out, they immediately braked the vehicles, and the bus also stopped. Although it did not cause a major disaster, the trolley car's body had already been damaged. When the personnel on the trolley car got off and negotiated with the public bus driver, the driver actually left the bus in the lane and left, resulting in a traffic jam. All the trolley buses going back and forth could not pass. The accumulating line was over twenty vehicles before the Shanghai Municipal Public Works Bureau was informed and sent personnel to the scene to inspect the situation and try to push the bus to the side of the road. Afterwards, traffic gradually resumed, but it had been interrupted for an hour. The passengers waiting for the bus at the various stations were waiting for a long time and were very suspicious when they saw the trolley bus arriving at the station.</p>

In the past month, they ran away together and hid near the small vegetable market on Datong Road, Zhabei. After Chen went missing, although he searched for news everywhere, he had no news and no whereabouts.

<h3>Enticing a Young Woman into a Forced Marriage</h3>
<p>Using the lure of job introduction, Tian Ali plots to marry out of desperation.  The treachery of the human heart has reached an extreme. Tian Ali, age 31, from Taixing, currently resides at No. 42, Cunshan Li, Caojiadu, Shanghai West. He works at an electric bulb factory.  Despite being of marriageable age, he is still unmarried. He suddenly conceived a far-fetched idea about a Miss Shen, named Dabao, from his hometown whom he knew well.  She is over twenty years old and still unmarried. Her appearance is fairly attractive, so he planned to trick her into becoming his wife. At the beginning of last month, he sent a letter to Miss Shen's mother, falsely claiming that various factories in Shanghai were short of female workers. He urged her to send Dabao to Shanghai quickly, saying that he could introduce her to a factory where she could earn a salary of thirty or forty yuan per month. Miss Shen's mother, being ignorant, believed it to be true, and also because her son, Xiuhua, was also in Shanghai and could take care of her, she had no worries. Her daughter Dabao came to Shanghai from her hometown at the end of last month and went directly to Tian's residence, where she ate and lodged.  For several days, not only did he not introduce her to work, but he also constantly flirted with her. Later, he even directly proposed marriage to Miss Shen.  The woman was greatly shocked and refused. Unexpectedly, Tian was so obsessed that he thought Miss Shen was new to Shanghai and had no way to resist.  He used a forceful attitude to deal with her, planning to commit adultery. Seeing that the situation was pressing, the woman secretly escaped the other day and, after repeatedly inquiring, found her brother (namely Shen Xiuhua) and reported what had happened. Xiuhua was furious when he heard this. He accompanied his sister to seize Tian and called the police, who took him back to the Sixth District Police Station. After questioning them separately, the District Chief determined that Tian Ali's case of designing to entice a young woman into forced marriage was a criminal matter, so he prepared a document and sent him to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Divorce Suit Changed to Termination of Relationship</h3>
<p>Sun Caidi, a young woman from Changzhou, now 25 years old, did not go through marriage procedures. At the age of 19, she married Wang Yinxiang, a native of Jiangwan who runs Wang Shunxing Bean Curd Shop on Di Siwei Road, through a matchmaker. Since entering the family, Caidi has run away three times and has been involved in litigation at the District Court Prosecutor's Office. Now, Sun Caidi has hired lawyer Zhang Enhua to file a personal lawsuit with the District Court, seeking a divorce. Her reasons are that she was abused and beaten by her husband, who intended to sell her. She had no choice but to escape back to her mother's home. The defendant, Wang Yinxiang, also filed a defense. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Qufei opened the court to hear the case. First, Sun Caidi testified, "I am not officially married to the defendant. We are actually living together illicitly. Because he beats me, I am asking for a divorce." The defendant, Wang Yinxiang, 34 years old, from Jiangwan, who runs a bean curd business, testified, "The plaintiff and I are indeed a couple married with candles and a matchmaker. The matchmaker is Li Gangshun. The wedding invitation has been stolen by the plaintiff. At that time, I paid a marriage gift of 150 yuan. She first ran away to Tongzhou and was immediately found. However, before long, she ran away to Changzhou for the second time. Although I managed to find her, we often quarreled. I do not want a divorce." The judge said to the plaintiff, "If you do not consider yourselves an official couple, why does the lawsuit state that you 'married him'?" The plaintiff's lawyer said, "They indeed did not go through marriage procedures in the past." The judge said, "Then there is no marriage to speak of, and it should be corrected urgently." So the plaintiff's lawyer rose and asked to correct it to a termination of relationship. He also stated that someone outside was trying to mediate, and the defendant wanted the plaintiff to compensate 100 yuan, but the plaintiff was unable to afford it, so no agreement was reached. Could the court mediate? The judge then asked the defendant, "Can this case be mediated?" The defendant replied, "The plaintiff asked someone to mediate with me, offering to return 150 yuan to me. I do not want to." The judge asked the plaintiff, who said, "I have no money." So the mediation failed, and the debate began. After the debate, it was considered concluded and scheduled for sentencing on the morning of the 12th of this month.</p>
<h3>Living with a Widower Who is Not a Good Person</h3>
<p>Seeking to terminate the relationship. Zhang Tangshi, a woman from Chuansha, Pudong, now 39 years old, became acquainted with Ma Ronghe (also known as Ma Yunyan) from Pinghu in September two years ago after her husband died and she had no one to rely on. They cohabited at No. 9, Linxian Fang, County Ji Road in this city. However, Ma had no occupation, and his daily food and clothing depended on Zhang pawning and borrowing. Zhang, unable to bear the burden, filed a lawsuit with the District Court, seeking to terminate the relationship. The statement roughly said, "After the plaintiff's husband died, she struggled to make a living as a female worker. In September of the 17th year of the Republic of China, she was seduced by the defendant Ma Ronghe, who claimed to have a job in a silk shop. The plaintiff was fooled for a time and lived with him, hoping to spend their lives together. Unexpectedly, the defendant is actually a freeloader with no occupation. He quarrels and demands money at home all day long, using the money to smoke opium and gamble, doing everything wrong. The plaintiff was initially defiled by him, and her mind was fooled. She tolerated it, but seeing that he had no intention of changing, it was impossible to live together. All the silver dollars, clothes, and ornaments left by her late husband were squandered by the defendant. After much thought, she only wants to terminate the relationship with him." Yesterday morning, Judge Tong Shenglü opened the court to hear the case. The defendant did not appear. The plaintiff, Zhang Tangshi, submitted a statement, reporting the situation and requesting permission to terminate the relationship. She also said that she was harassed by the defendant, so she came to file the case. The judge, after hearing the statement, instructed, "The defendant did not appear. We will order a further summons and continue the trial."</p>
<h3>Attempted Bride Kidnapping Mistakenly Abducts a Silly Aunt</h3>
<p>After being carried onto the sedan chair, she shouted loudly, and the crowd punched her twice. Yan Xiaoliang, a farmer in the old residential area of Xinxing, Shanghai Northwest, has two daughters. The elder, Lingzhen, is 19 years old and has a good figure. The younger, Guizhen, is 16 years old and is a silly woman with big ears. Four years ago, Lingzhen was betrothed to Wu Fusheng, the son of the Wu Zhang family. Fusheng is also 19 years old this year, but Wu Zhang's husband died not long ago, and the family is poor and unable to marry her. Yan Xiaoyu regretted his rashness at the time, thinking that he should not have betrothed his daughter to a poor family and ruined her future. He showed signs of trying to break off the engagement. When Wu Zhang heard about this, she often warned him that if he wanted to break off the engagement, she would definitely kidnap the bride. So Yan had taken precautions and often asked neighbors near the Wu Zhang family to inquire about any dangers. On the evening of the other day, Wu Fusheng had gathered more than ten villagers to carry out the bride kidnapping. One of his neighbors hurriedly reported this to Yan Xiaoliang, who hid his eldest daughter Lingzhen. When the kidnappers rushed in, they only saw his second daughter, Guizhen, there. At the time, they did not know it was the younger sister and mistakenly thought it was Lingzhen, so they carried her out. After Guizhen was carried onto the sedan chair by the crowd, her silliness broke out, and she shouted loudly. The patrol police arrived, and the crowd punched Guizhen twice and fled. The patrol police then took Guizhen to the First Sub-station of the Sixth District, summoned Yan Xiaoliang, questioned him, and immediately brought in Wu Zhang for questioning. Yesterday afternoon, they were transferred to the District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>A Woman Carrying Ice Died in the Water</h3>
<p>Being small and weak, she was unable to bear the heavy burden and slipped into the water, drowning in the river. Chen Gu's daughter, Chen Maoda, a 20-year-old woman from Maluqiao Village, Donggou, Pudong, was sent to work at a nearby ice factory because her family was poor. The other day, Maoda was carrying a load of ice when she slipped and fell into the river. She was immediately pulled out, but she had already drowned. Yesterday, the local security reported this to the District Court for inspection, and the woman's mother requested exemption from inspection, which was approved.</p>
<h3>A Western Woman Sues for Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>A stack of planks was the cause of the disaster. Zhou Huinan denies donating the license. In the winter of last year, a Western woman, Mrs. Brown Lim Phu, was walking along Avenue Albert, French Concession, in front of a workshop run by Huang Aitang when she tripped over a plank and was injured. She was treated in the hospital and recovered. The Western woman then sued the owner of the workshop in the French Court, arguing that he should not have piled planks in the middle of the road, obstructing traffic. The court found the case to be true and ordered Huang Aitang to compensate the plaintiff for her losses. However, the defendant refused to comply and disappeared. Later, the plaintiff's lawyer discovered that the license for the workshop was held by Zhou Huinan. Therefore, she filed another lawsuit with the French Court, requesting Zhou to pay the compensation. Yesterday, the defendant was summoned and hired a lawyer to defend him, claiming that the license for Huang Aitang's workshop was not donated by his client. However, his client, Zhou Huinan, also established a workshop nearby, and the plaintiff had mistakenly accused him and requested to recover the loss of one thousand taels of silver. The plaintiff's lawyer also said that his lawyer had asked the French Ministry of Public Works who had donated the license for Huang Aitang's workshop and had received a letter from the Ministry confirming that it was indeed Zhou Huinan. Even if there was a mistake, it was the fault of the French Ministry of Public Works. Before filing the lawsuit, his lawyer had sent a letter inquiring about the matter, but the defendant Zhou Huinan never replied. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed. The Chinese and Western judges ordered them to leave and wait for a verdict.</p>

A neighbor, Zhou Wang, volunteered to introduce her to a job in Pudong, but said that A Mei needed a recent photo for registration. A Mei reluctantly took a photo and gave it to Wang. Wang took it away and five days later, took A Mei out. Unexpectedly, only Zhou Wang returned home in the evening. Zhou Li asked about it, but Wang said that A Mei had already returned home. Zhou Li was shocked, knowing that she had been deceived, and that factories never required photos for registration, unlike schools. She filed a complaint with the Second District Police Station.

The association received an order from the Ministry of Interior, No. 67 of the Li character, which stated that "a telegram was received on behalf of the paper firecrackers listed as one of the superstitious items to be banned, stating the reasons and requesting the withdrawal of the order to avoid unemployment among the people. It is known that this case has been submitted to the government and the court for approval for flexible handling." Please be informed.</p>

<h3>Imposing Taxes on Silver Imports (Continued) by Xu Pei-kun</h3>
<p>There are many ways to remedy the silver exchange rate, but the most effective one is to impose taxes on silver imports. As for adopting the gold standard or the gold exchange standard, it will not only fail to alleviate the financial turmoil, but will also exacerbate it. Our country is not prepared in terms of cash reserves, financial management talents, and the impact on people's lives. Those who talk about the gold standard without preparation do not know where to start. What benefits does the gold standard have for the people? Why don't you explain the reasons to us in detail? From my personal observation, our country cannot adopt even a virtual gold standard within ten years. If we try to implement it with a piece of legislation, it will only be nominally implemented, making the financial situation more chaotic. Furthermore, based on past governance and the economic environment, the exchange rate of the new gold coins will still rise and fall wildly like today's silver exchange rate, or even exceed it. Those who are familiar with the national conditions and know the changes in the world's exchange rates will not say these things without reason. Therefore, we advocate the gold standard, but if we only seek the beautiful name of a new gold coin and ignore the actual situation, then we might as well not talk about it. On the contrary, if those who advocate the gold standard take the welfare of the country and the people as the premise, then we must discuss it in the long term and study it more, and not consider it a task. In the past few decades, eight or nine out of ten new enterprises or new facilities in our country have failed. Looking back on the past, I can't help but tremble. Moreover, the currency system has a direct impact on the lives of the people. If we are not sure, please do not deceive ourselves and trap the national economy in an unrecoverable situation, and cut off the livelihoods of millions of our people. At the beginning of the financial crisis, the government authorities seemed to have predetermined relief measures, such as cracking down on the import of foreign coins, prohibiting the export of cash, establishing international exchange banks, and imposing taxes on silver imports. It is understood that for some reason, they were not immediately implemented. However, as the crisis expanded and became critical, the government resolutely cracked down on the import of Mexican silver dollars, followed by the prohibition of cash exports, and started to provide relief. This is something we have to congratulate the government for, and even more so for the people. We should all support the government to achieve the goal of restoring the position of the silver exchange rate and stopping the crisis. It is a pity that these relief measures were implemented too late and had little effect. However, the current economic crisis is full of problems. Production organs cannot maintain work, financial bankruptcy is imminent, prices are ridiculously high, life is difficult, and the national economy is about to collapse. All these phenomena can be attributed to the failure to take early measures to stop this financial crisis. May I ask what crime the common people have committed to suffer this economic disaster? Can the loss of national vitality be measured in distance? In order to remedy the situation, we should urge the government to implement taxes on silver imports as soon as possible, so that the harvest in the evening may not be without small compensation. In addition, measures such as stopping gambling on standard gold, managing exchange rate speculation, and establishing exchange rate banks are also urgent measures that should be implemented in order. This is the duty of the government to the people. However, since taxes on silver imports are the focus of solving the silver exchange crisis, I will elaborate on the reasons for levying taxes and refute the arguments against levying taxes in the following article. I hope to discuss it with those who are knowledgeable. (To be continued) Acknowledgment: I received a copy of the 16th volume, 1st issue of "Women's Magazine" and the 752nd issue of "English Weekly" from the Commercial Press yesterday. Thank you.</p>

<p>Free Talk - A Word of Wisdom by Long</p>
<p>The joyous and sweet life gained when love matures cannot compare to the sorrowful and desolate feeling when it changes midway. The pain of failure in the field of love is greater than any setback in career. No matter how confident a man is, he cannot guarantee that a woman will never love someone else. The same is true for women towards men. Astronomers can measure the distance of planets, but they cannot measure the heights and depths of people's hearts. Everyone knows that money is an external thing, but many people still try to make money desperately, regardless of their lives. Men take the beauty of women's appearance as the direction of love. Women take the wealth of men as the condition for exchange. A woman's pair of socks costs more than 20 yuan. No wonder a load of rice also costs more than 20 yuan. The friendship of gentlemen is as light as water. The lighter it is, the more lasting it is. The love between men and women is as strong as wine. The stronger it is, the harder it is to wake up. A person who does not know how to save is less intelligent than a bee. Young men and women who indulge in the field of love or gambling dens are no less dangerous than dragonflies throwing themselves into spider webs or moths rushing towards flames. They have the same possibility of losing their lives. The more jealous a woman is, the more faithful she is, because in her heart there is only you who is lovable, so she does not allow you to love other women. Love is the private property of young people. Of course, it cannot be abandoned or abused. Everything, if taken too seriously, will cause a lot of trouble. But if it is too optimistic, there will be no interest. Therefore, people who are too stupid or too intelligent suffer more than anyone else.</p>
<h3>A Record of Ruan Wenda's Expulsion of Foreign Warships</h3>
<p>Jue Mi. At the end of the Jiaqing reign and the beginning of the Daoguang reign of the Qing Dynasty, Ruan Wenda of Yizheng was the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi. Wenda made it his business to strictly control foreign merchants. Foreign merchants actually benefited from the interests of foreign merchants, and foreign merchants relied on the protection of foreign merchants. Because of this, foreign merchants were arrogant and unruly. Wenda restrained them whenever anything happened. At that time, a British ship was in Huangpu. Because of a dispute over water with the people, they used a musket to kill a civilian. Wenda sternly ordered the foreign merchants to obtain the murderer before boarding the ship. The murderer drew his knife and committed suicide. This is one thing. Another French person once beat a civilian woman to death. Wenda immediately captured the murderer and executed him to pay for his crime. This is another thing. These are all things that happened in the early years of Jiaqing's 22nd year as governor of Guangdong and Guangxi. Later, at the beginning of Daoguang, British warships escorting goods shot and killed two civilians in Lingding Mountain. Wenda immediately ordered the foreign merchants to demand the murderer from the British Taipan. At that time, the British only had Taipan to manage trade affairs, and no consuls were set up. The Taipan lied and said that he only managed trade affairs, and the warships had military chiefs whose duties were greater, and my orders could not be carried out on them. Wenda then ordered the military chief to be informed. The military chief again falsely claimed that there were also many people who were beaten and injured by the people and were about to die, and wanted to offset the deaths. Wenda saw through his deception, so he informed the Taipan again that if he did not hand over the murderer, he would seal the cabin and stop trading. The Taipan also claimed that he really could not hand over the murderer and could do nothing. He was willing to stop trading. At that time, the fishing boats had also avoided outside the ocean for nearly a month. But Wenda held on even more firmly. The Taipan then led all the foreign merchants to Huangpu on large ships and reported that there was nothing they could do but return to their home countries as a group and not do business. Wenda immediately issued an edict, saying that if you are willing to return, then return. Our court does not value your tax revenue. So more than 20 British cargo ships packed up their masts and made a gesture of exporting. They still reported, "Since the adults have allowed us to return to our country, why are there soldiers and cannons on the fort?" Da also added an edict, "The Humen Fort is always set up all year round, not to wait for you to leave."</p>
<h3>To Tao Xuantao by Zai Dong</h3>
<p>A fine son is a good lad, and a dragon's descendant is a good daughter. She can cultivate as a banling history officer, and study the poetry of the carp court. Horses are emptied from Ji Bei, and praises roar like lions from Ying Dong. The equality of Qian and Kun is easy, and the heroines have dignity. The Yellow Emperor is a civilized race, and youth is the educator. Heaven's heart is the seed of benevolence, and the wind sweeps away the madness of Huaxia. Attack wood with solid wrongness, and help the art of hemp with Pengzhi. Chun Guan's peach and plum belong to him, opening freedom everywhere. Initiating the Republic of China is difficult only in legislation. New eras of sun and moon color the old rivers and mountains. All things contain the heart mirror, and the double texts surround the wonderful pen. The star Ji Duo is precious, shining brightly in the ranks of immortals. The family of Tao cultivates and studies, and the clothes and hats have been around for six hundred years. The inheritance is now a new female student, fearing her predecessors. You Xiang is Han Bin, and his name is the same as Zheng Xuan. Jian Xiu, I should be responsible for completing this beautiful marriage.</p>
<p>He wants to add bombardment. Moreover, our dynasty shows people with great stature. How can we allow you to return to your country and then pursue and attack you. So the ships had no choice but to export. They turned back and anchored in the Waiyang Xiaoyi Bay for a long time, while the warships really fled far away. Before long, Taipan reported that he did not know when the warships had fled far away. We are really ashamed of our incompetence. If the adults allow us to import and trade, it would be a favor. Otherwise, we can only return to our country and wait. The foreign merchants also asked for help on their behalf, and ordered Taipan to send a report back to his country to inform the king that the murderer must be brought when the next cargo ship comes to Guangdong before import is allowed. Otherwise, it will not be allowed. Taipan also made the same report. At this point, Wenda agreed, and it was not until the spring of the third year that the ships were allowed to pass as before. At that time, the foreign merchants were all worried that the customs duties would be greatly reduced because of this, and they were afraid that other incidents would occur. Some officials in the city also spoke for him to ease the situation. Wenda insisted that the national honor was important and the tax revenue was light. The search for the murderer and the truth must not be deceived by him. He also ordered that warships should not be allowed to come again in the future. It is not appropriate to protect the goods, but to harm the goods. The cargo ships that came to Guangdong in the fourth and fifth years reported that they were afraid to return to their country because they were harming the goods, and they did not know where to escape and could not find them. Such warships did not come again in the fourth, fifth, and sixth years. Later, when Lin Wenzhong was the governor of Guangdong and Guangxi, he followed Wenda's law. Today, people only know about Wenzhong burning opium at Humen, but they do not know about Wenda's expulsion of foreign warships in Guangdong. I have made a special note of it as above.</p>
<h3>Interesting Notes on Opium by Yan Ye</h3>
<p>On the evening of the 63rd Anniversary of the Anti-Opium Movement, friends gathered to discuss interesting stories about opium. I have recorded one or two to submit to this journal. In Chengyi, there was a man named Zhou who was the richest man in the village. He relied on his wealth to connect with dignitaries above and accept ruffians below. He ran rampant in the village and tyrannized the people. People feared him like a tiger, but dared to be angry but dared not speak. Zhou had a son who was just over twenty years old. He was intelligent and beautiful, truly the son of a plow cow. In the village, there was a scholar named Wang who had repeatedly suffered insults from Zhou. Later, Wang suddenly became close to Zhou's son, and they were as close as family members. Therefore, Wang, who used to be incompatible with Zhou, is now his trusted aide. When the villagers saw this, they all scolded him for being shameless. Wang was originally a man who cherished his reputation, but now he suddenly became abnormal. Gambling dens and opium dens all had his footprints. He used to compare every penny, but now he squandered money like dirt. And wherever Wang went, Zhou's son would follow. Whatever Wang did, Zhou's son would do. And Zhou's son was even better at smoking than Wang, and he could not live without this gentleman for a day. In half a year, Wang spent more than 300 yuan, while Zhou's son did not lose a single penny. At this point, Wang went to sea to support himself. Zhou's son lost Wang as if he had lost his mother. Only the opium den was laid out to entertain him. He sat and lay there, happy and oblivious of Shu. His father forbade him, but he did not listen. In the past, Wang was the host, but now he had to break his own pocket. Moreover, he relied on his wealth and had a large amount of opium, spending five or six yuan a day. And other waste was also huge. In the blink of an eye, the fur and ge clothes had changed. Scholar Wang returned from Shanghai and learned about Zhou's son's situation. He smiled and said, "My plan has succeeded." When people asked him, he said, "Zhou is a tiger in the village, and no one can do anything about him. Although his strength is insufficient, he can be taken by plan. Therefore, I imitated the trick of self-harm, spending a lot of money to lead his son into evil, so that he would ruin his family. Now I have triumphed. I will see that in less than ten years, the Zhou family will be destroyed and the village will be free from harm." A year later, Zhou died in depression because his son could not be taught. At this point, his son became even more unscrupulous. In less than ten years, the huge property was exhausted in smoking opium. People said that Zhou deserved this result. Scholar Wang's trick of self-harm was wonderful, but the harm of opium is terrible. In Zhabei, there was a man named Tao who was an opium addict. He stayed at home and did nothing, making a living in the opium mist day and night. His opium was always bought from the French Concession. People said to him, "You hide drugs on your body and travel back and forth. Aren't you afraid of being checked by the detectives?" He said calmly, "Those who are caught are all stupid things. I have lived in Zhabei for three years, and I must go to the concession to buy opium twice a month. Although I have also been checked many times, I have never made a mistake. Because I have a white towel, I must hold it when I go out. The drugs I buy are stuffed in the towel and held in my hand. If I encounter a detective, let him search my whole body. I deliberately wipe my nose with the towel. Even if he is clever, how can he know that my things are in the towel?" Those who heard it praised it.</p>
<h3>A Record of Jinan Pearl Spring by Sun Linchang</h3>
<p>Jinan has seventy-two famous springs, one of which is Pearl Spring. When I traveled to Tianjin a few years ago, I went to the place and was introduced by a friend to visit the spring. The spring is located in the east of the provincial government. The spring water is surrounded by a stone pool, which is concave from the north. The pool water is clear and shallow, and the swimming fish can be counted. There are more than ten spring eyes in the southeast corner of the pool. The spring water flows out with a gurgling sound, penetrating into the sky and forming waves that appear and disappear, which can be called a spectacle. There is an ancient locust tree on the south side of the pool, which is green and lovely. Its curved trunk faces north, as if bowing to the spring. There are several magnificent halls on the north side of the pool, named (Pearl Spring Hermitage). The windows are bright and the tables are clean, and the furnishings are elegant. It is a place for the provincial seat to entertain guests. Behind the hall, the pavilions are winding and the flowers and trees are layered. On the front of the hall, there are eight pillars, each with three couplets, one of which is Sun Baoqi's couplet (facing the clear pool of Biyuan, it is ready to clarify the people and things) (watching the hundred-foot tall trees, you must know that the roots are intertwined, waiting for the ice and frost), one of which is Hefei Zhang Guangjian's couplet (the pearl scoops the heart of the wave, bright and can illuminate the country) (the spring flows on the stone, clearer than being in the mountain), one of which is written by Jiang Zhiyou and written by Zhang Mingsen, the long couplet (tall trees know the spring and do not need to ask Song elm and Ming locust, surrounded by houses and lush, all into paintings) (Wenbo try to beat the pulp and thinly pick red sage and green algae, let me linger in the middle of the stream, forgetting to return). The three couplets are all excellent, and they can add a lot of color to Pearl Spring. Shenyang Qiuxun Yushuang Yis owner Cheng Yanqiu came to Shenyang from Benxi Lake on the 25th of last month. Because there are still a few days before the birthday of Zhang Xueliang, the performance will be hosted by Zhang Xueming, Bao Yucai, etc. The first seven days will be performed at the Northeast Grand Theater. Tickets will be sold in advance until the 26th. The tickets have been sold out. Now the performance of Biyu Zan is very popular. Zhang Changguan's hall meeting will be held at the Beiling Villa. At this time, the stage is being built in a hurry, and there will be a grand scene.

<h3>Warmth in the Heart (208) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 11: Cui Luo Zhu Qiao, the Beauty Returns to a Good Scholar; Qing Lu Jiang Wo, the Famous Courtesan Marries into a Famous Family. Zuo Shichen thought to himself, Yi Hua's words sound good, but in reality, she is only afraid that the price is not right. She even came up with a great theory. Then he asked her, "Then why didn't this Wu San Shao succeed?" I heard that their old master was a former provincial governor and also opened a pawn shop. The aunt said, "I know Wu San Shao is rich, but this young master is a bit meticulous and not very generous, especially since he is the most suspicious person. Although they are wealthy people, they are more cautious than our poor people when taking out money. They really have to weigh every penny. Therefore, it is not easy to negotiate with him. And I also heard that his grandmother is not very easy to get along with. It's like a kind of mellow wine, a bit (good on the mouth, hard to let go)." Zuo Shichen thought again, this must be because he can't achieve Yi Hua's goal of 5,000 yuan, so she said these words. It can be seen that the things in the brothel are difficult to handle. If you spend money casually, they will call you a "plague student." If you don't, if you calculate a little, they will say you are a miser. How can you achieve the perfect balance? Zuo Shichen said, "So Wu San has this problem. Then what about Zhang Da?" The aunt said, "As far as I'm concerned, Zhang Da Shao is the most perfect. It's just that he's a little older. In fact, people in their forties can't be considered old. Many people in their seventies and eighties take concubines. Not to mention taking a small one, but even married couples take a successor wife. People in their forties and fifties take women of eighteen, nineteen, twenty-one, or twenty-two. I say Zhang Da Shao is first of all a regular person, not the kind of superficial and slippery person. He is also a loyal and honest person, not the kind of cunning and narrow-minded person. Ah Nan is a child. If she encounters a arrogant and thin person, wouldn't she be fooled by them? There is also one thing that is really rare to encounter. This Zhang Da Shao has now broken his string. He said that after marrying our Ah Nan, he will no longer take a successor wife. Second Shao, think about it, this is something that is hard to find even if you break your iron shoes. It is a good marriage predestined in a previous life, struck through the wooden fish. It is really her blessing. Think about it, such a big rich man will really not take a successor wife. Three to five years later, after giving birth to two male treasures, wouldn't the man be overjoyed and make her the official wife? Second Shao, think about where to find this kind of opportunity. I'm afraid it's hard to find even if you walk all over the Shanghai beach." Zuo Shichen thought that this old woman was talking nonsense as if she was all planning for her daughter. I'm afraid the 5,000 yuan is speaking there. However, the aunt's words can't be said to be completely without reason. It is true that people in their forties who take concubines, once the heat cools down, will become divorced. People who are over middle age are ultimately better than young people.</p>

<h3>The Price of Gold Drops by Ten Taels</h3>
<p>The storm has calmed somewhat, with latent signs of decline. Yesterday, the 7th, the rising tide of gold prices finally subsided, trending downward. However, sporadic surges of two or three taels did occur, causing some confusion in the market. Still, the turbulence was not as violent as the previous day. The morning market saw only minor fluctuations of around nine taels, and public sentiment was softening. Foreign exchange rates showed signs of easing, though the "big bars" (大條) decreased in size, the quoted prices remained unchanged. Most of the transactions between brokers were characterized by supply exceeding demand. Although silver bars shrank in size from the early market, they opened at lower prices due to negative sentiment. Subsequently, sellers, initially eager to capitalize, grew weary, leading to a particularly weak afternoon for drafts. Buyers remained hesitant, and the market suffered a precipitous drop, breaking the eighty-tael mark at 577.5 taels. Later, it hovered around seventy-nine taels. As it was a weekend, the market closed as usual.</p>
<p>Although the price of silver decreased, the opening price immediately fell. Both British silver and standard silver were reduced by one-quarter and one-half respectively. The opening price for July was 586.5 taels, an immediate drop of 2.3 taels. Gross trading fluctuated by three or four taels. Yuan Cheng Yong and other firms sold off their holdings, soon bringing the price down to 81.5 taels. Scattered retail purchases then pushed the price up to 84 taels. Foreign exchange rates appeared to ease. Jardine Matheson sold July sterling at 6 pence 75 to a shilling, but later retreated to 82.5 taels. The listed price remained unchanged, suggesting underlying anxieties. Around 9:40 AM, the price was 81 taels, after which Yuansheng and other firms bought in, and banks engaged in forward trading of September sterling at 6 pence 875, causing the price to jump up four taels. By 10:30 AM, it was 85.3 taels, followed by a series of upward and downward movements, with a range of about thirteen taels. Around 11:00 AM, the price moved up two to three taels, and by 11:30 AM, it was five to six taels. This reflected public uncertainty, with traders alternately buying and selling. The foreign exchange market remained calm, with low trading volume.</p>
<p>Large traders dumped their holdings, intensifying the downward trend. As large traders unloaded, prices plummeted by seven or eight taels. Near the close, the price was 77.5 taels. At noon, the market closed at 579 taels, down 9.8 taels from the previous day. The highest price of the half-day was 86.8 taels, and the lowest was 77.5 taels, a difference of 9.3 taels. The listed price remained at 636.6 taels, a difference of fifty to sixty taels. Ultimately, it was down fifty-seven or fifty-eight taels. The overnight lending rate was 79 taels. Goods opened at 85.8 taels and closed at 77.5 taels.</p>
<p>Supply exceeded demand in the market, and buying and selling activities by various firms were chaotic. Firms such as Dade Cheng, Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, Yuantai, and Shenxing engaged in intermittent buying and selling. Yuansheng, Yu Yuyong, Richang, and retail investors were mostly buyers. "Hedge accounts" (套頭) also entered the market. Yifeng, Fuxingyong, Yu Da, Yuanxingyong, Shunli, Chengfengyong, Yongcheng Chang, and Yufa Yong were primarily sellers. The Dalian group sold about 1,200 lots and bought about 700 to 800 lots. The Guangdong group saw irregular activity, but overall, they were net sellers.</p>
<p>The gold market will also be closed for one day tomorrow, June 9th (Monday). Due to the Western holiday, all banks will be closed for one day. The Gold Exchange, including Sunday, will be closed for two days, and will resume business as usual on the 10th.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Trend Towards Ease</h3>
<p>The price of gold fell by three-tenths, and hedging (套頭) became even closer. Yesterday, a Saturday, the foreign exchange market followed its usual practice of only operating for half a day in the morning. The exchange rates posted by HSBC remained unchanged. Despite the contraction in the size of "big bars," (大條) this did not affect the exchange rates. The interbank trading generally tended towards easing. The market was initially calm, but gradually weakened and was especially weak at midday, as the gold market softened and broke through the eighty-tael mark. Compared to the 6th, the price had fallen by almost ten taels. At the midday close, the exchange rates compared to the 6th showed Sterling increasing by 3.125 for near-term and 2.5 for long-term, the US dollar increased by 5.625 for near-term and 4.375 for long-term. The Japanese exchange rate decreased by three-tenths. Therefore, hedging (金子) became even closer. However, Chinese speculators did not engage in large transactions, largely because the gold market would be closed for the next two days, reducing risk. Only a few transactions occurred. About £100,000 of sterling was traded, with a turnover of several tens of thousands of pounds, with Jardine Matheson selling and then buying back. Sumitomo, Oriental, and other firms also traded tens of thousands of pounds among themselves. About 200,000 US dollars were sold, absorbed by Mitsui, Sumitomo, and the Bank of East Asia. Interbank trading totaled 100,000 dollars. There were few transactions in Japanese currency because the buying and selling prices among banks were too far apart, and few inquired. The market was chaotic.</p>
<p>The domestic sterling exchange rate fluctuated by about 25 points, and the swap spread was 125. Near-term rates were slightly lower than the previous day. In the morning, the rate for the current month was 1 shilling 6 pence 5 for buying, 5615 for selling; the rate for July was 6 pence 625, August 75, and September 875 for buying, 6 pence 9375 for selling. In the morning, Jardine Matheson and Sumitomo traded 10,000 pounds for July at 6 pence 75. Jardine Matheson sold 5,000 pounds at 6 pence 75. Sumitomo and Oriental traded 10,000 pounds for September at 6 pence 875. Jardine Matheson absorbed 10,000 pounds for July at 6 pence 8125. At the afternoon close, the rate for the current month was 6 pence 75, July 8125, August 9375, and September 7 pence 0625 for buying, with the selling price increased by 0625.</p>
<p>The domestic US dollar exchange rate fluctuated by about half a yuan, and the swap spread was 25. In the morning, the rate for the current month was 37.5 yuan, July 37.75 yuan, August 38 yuan, and September 38.25 yuan for buying, with the selling price increased by 125. Sumitomo and China Allied traded 50,000 dollars for July at 37.9375 yuan. The Bank of East Asia bought 50,000 dollars for September at 38.4375 yuan. Mitsui Sumitomo bought 100,000 dollars for October at 38.625 yuan. At the afternoon close, the rate for the current month was 37.9375 yuan, July 38.0625 yuan, August 38.3125 yuan, and September 38.5625 yuan for buying, with the selling price increased by 125.</p>
<p>The domestic Japanese currency exchange rate fluctuated by about two points, and the swap spread remained at one point. Trading was quiet. In the morning, the rate for the current month was 1 tael 3 qian 2 fen 5, July 1 tael 3 qian 1 fen 625, August 1 tael 3 qian 0 fen 5, September 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen 625. The buying and selling prices were chaotic. Sumitomo sold 100,000 dollars for August at 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen 75 in the morning. At the afternoon close, the rate for the current month was 1 tael 2 qian 9 fen, July 1 tael 2 qian 8 fen 8, August 1 tael 2 qian 7 fen, and September 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen 5, with the buying price reduced by one point.</p>
<h3>Silver Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>According to a cable from London yesterday, the price of silver had again declined. The near-term price decreased by 25 to 16 and a half pence, and the long-term price also decreased by 25 to 16 and 3/125 pence. Small transactions by Chinese sellers in the spot market were flat. According to a cable from New York, the price of American silver had also decreased by half a cent, with the spot price at 36 and 625/1000 cents. The rate of sterling to the US dollar increased by 03125 to 4 dollars and 85 and 875/1000 cents. The rate of the Japanese yen to the US dollar remained at 49 yuan and 4375/10000 cents.

A cable from the Electric News Agency reported no significant changes.</p>
<h3>Interest Rates Rise to 3.5%</h3>
<p>Market Overview: Amidst the surging prices of gold, the financial sector generally adhered to a principle of contraction, so there was no immediate impact. However, due to excessively large settlements by banks, there was an urgent need for funds, leading to a shortage of cash reserves and a tightening of credit conditions. This "collateral damage," if occurring unexpectedly during normal times, would have been impossible to remedy. However, preparations had been made in advance, so even though the market was tight, there was no significant impact.</p>
<p>Daily Interest Rates (洋厘): The interest rates for both the morning and afternoon markets were balanced by supply and demand, with no competition, resulting in a uniform price of 7 qian 1 fen 7 li 5 hao. This was only 1 hao 2 hu 5 si better than the previous day's afternoon market. Due to the localized tightness of credit conditions, interest rates on silver loans naturally rose. A few days ago, there was already a sense of pressure. Yesterday morning, interest rates on silver loans jumped to 3 qian 5 fen, the highest seen this year. The afternoon market was slightly calmer, but still at 3 qian. Market participants adding water to money was 1 qian 8 or 9 fen. Banks posted a rate of 1 qian 4 fen.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The price of Jiangsu small silver coins was stable, with no change in either market, remaining at 6 qian 2 fen 5 li 5 hao, improving by 1 li compared to the previous day. Only 2,500 jiao were traded in the morning market. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was 6 qian in the morning market and 5 qian 9 fen 8 li in the afternoon market, a difference of 2 li between the two markets. The price improved by 1 li 2 hao 5 si compared to the previous day's afternoon market. A total of 155,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 115,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of copper coins rose by 3,000 to 410,000 cash.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver Coins (銀欵): Yesterday was Saturday, and banks closed in the afternoon as usual, so all kinds of receipts and disbursements were slightly lower. Chinese merchants received and disbursed over 2.1 million in banknotes, foreign merchants received and disbursed 1.4 to 1.5 million, and settlements were over 2 million. Various cargo, tax, and miscellaneous receipts and disbursements were over 8 million. Special disbursements were 1 million, with 1.2 million entering the warehouse and 800,000 leaving. Japanese banks received and disbursed over 3.8 million, with 700,000 entering the warehouse. Private banks and public silver firms received and disbursed over 4.3 million, and head money was over 3.5 million. Remittances from various sources were 1.3 million, and cash transfers were several tens of thousands. (洋欵) Drafts traded amounted to 1.785 million in the morning market and 840,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 30,000 in the morning market and 100,005 in the afternoon market. Off-market banknotes were 175,000 in the morning market and 95,000 in the afternoon market. Silver dollars were 40,000 in the morning market and 10,000 in the afternoon market. Interbank transactions were 550,000 in the morning market and 500,000 in the afternoon market. Over 1.2 million was received and disbursed through foreign accounts at various banks, with banknote inflows and outflows exceeding 1 million. Transactions with foreign banks were over 300,000. Private banks and public silver firms received and disbursed over 7 million, and head money was over 2.1 million. Call money was 1.1 million, and receipts from various sources were over 800,000. 50,000 in silver dollars and over 200,000 in cash were exported. Transactions by small private banks were 600,000.</p>

<h3>Bond Prices Rise Significantly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai bond market saw active trading of various spot bonds, with an estimated 23,000 yuan of disbandment bonds and several thousand yuan of other bonds, totaling over 35,000 yuan. Futures trading remained active, and the market was lively. The morning session saw approximately 6 million yuan in trading, and the afternoon session saw approximately 4.7 million yuan, for a total of over 10.7 million yuan. Bond prices generally rose due to improved financial conditions and a slight improvement in the political situation. Buying interest increased, and market sentiment was optimistic, leading to a significant rise in prices. Customs and disbandment spot bonds rose by about 3 yuan each, and futures also rose by more than 1 yuan. Other bonds also rose by about 50 fen to 1 yuan each, with the exception of the 7-year bonds, which were slightly weaker.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Turns Soft</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly weaker due to the cessation of foreign exchange, the decline in raw cotton sales, and softening sentiment. The looming clouds of war also discourage sellers from attempting to raise prices. The market is weakening further. A certain factory still hasn't released its large speculative holdings. Speculators see that spot goods are still not selling well and short sell during rallies. The spot market is seeing more traders reversing their positions from short to long. If gold prices fall and silver prices rise, and Japanese yarn becomes less expensive, then local yarn may see a large expansion in the market. Human prices have fallen by one or two taels. The exchange market opened with a slightly looser gold market and scattered sentiment. There was a lack of buyers, and near-term prices rose by one cash, while far-term prices fell by 1, 3, 4, and 6 cash. In the afternoon, raw cotton prices declined, actual sales were weak, retail investors were bearish, and the market became sluggish. All months declined by 5, 7, 8, and 9 cash. Total trading volume for the day was 17,150 bales. The closing prices of human prices are recorded below. Human Prices Closing Prices Increase/Decrease Open Interest September 1609 Rise 218,400 June 1168 Fall 623,400 October 1610 1418,450 July 1582 623,140 November 1616 87,800 August 1599 102,750 Spot Sales Good, Price Flat Spot yarn sales are still good. Various groups bought 1,430 bales, and traders bought 505 bales. Prices are flat. Among customer groups, Yunnan bought the most, 500 bales. In addition, Tianjin bought 355 bales, Guangdong bought 70 bales, Xuzhou bought 265 bales, the interior bought 55 bales, Niuzhuang bought 45 bales, Sichuan bought 50 bales, Ningbo bought 20 bales, Jiangxi bought 25 bales, Luzhou bought 20 bales, and other groups bought 30 bales.</p>
<h3>Reaction after the Surge in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The Han group is short-selling... the situation is easing, and the cotton market is weakening. This is because foreign cotton prices continue to fall, foreign exchange is stagnant, and the gold market is falling, leading to bearish sentiment. The Han group has also sold off large quantities, so the market is relatively loose. However, given the overall situation and the scarcity of spot goods, a large decline is still unlikely. Most people currently believe that the surge was too strong, and there may be a temporary pullback. The rise in Han prices has slowed slightly. The exchange market opened with Han prices. American cotton prices have fallen again. Foreign exchange rates are stable, and the gold market is slightly down, leading to bearish sentiment. There is a shortage of buyers in the market, and prices for each month are down 1 to 2 cash. In the afternoon, the market is still weak, and prices have fallen another 1.5 to 3 cash. Total trading volume for the day is 46,500 dan. However, LICHANG purchases about 6,000 to 7,000 dan in each transaction. The closing prices of Han prices are recorded below. Han Prices Closing Prices Increase/Decrease Open Interest August 38.15 Fall 2513,000 June 36.95 Fall 3060,500 October 37.60 4058,900 July 37.65 3571,300 November 37.30 5040,900 Spot Cotton Transactions Resume Spot cotton transactions resume. Factories are not interested in sources. Sources include 250 bales of Tongzhou cotton, 750 bales of Yao cotton, and 200 bales of Yao cotton from Guangdong, priced at 34 taels and 6 qian.</p>
<h3>American Cotton and Osaka Sampin Still Trending Down</h3>
<p>American cotton remains soft. Yesterday, American cotton initially weakened due to good weather and a lack of buyers, but later recovered slightly due to short covering. Futures prices fell by 11 to 19 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. British cotton futures prices rose by 3 to 5 points, and spot prices rose by 7 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton markets were closed. The original cable is recorded below.

<h3>American Cotton Weekly Report is Weak</h3>
<p>A dispatch from New York on the 6th reports on the cotton market conditions for the week: Weather conditions for cotton have been favorable this week, but trade reports have been poor, leading to active selling of raw cotton. However, the early June report on the progress of new cotton crops cannot alleviate uncertainty about the cotton season. As a result, selling pressure has eased slightly, and buying interest has increased. There are rumors that the Farm Credit Administration and cooperatives will use new cotton to collateralize 75% to 85% of the market price, and then release loans based on market price changes. The report also indicates that news about the new cotton crop is better, and cotton prices have softened slightly. July futures are stable due to deferred settlements. Demand for spot cotton remains weak, and cloth sales remain sluggish. The weekend statistics are appended below (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week Last Week Total This Season Total Since August 1 Factory Use Cumulative 14.554 14.631 Since August 1 Export Cumulative 6.104 6.585 To Japan 6.460 6.516 To China 0.967 0.975 To England 0.209 0.210 To Germany 1.225 1.235 New York Inventory 1.685 1.694 Inventory in All Ports and Towns 0.210 0.214 Worldwide Supply 2.517 2.463 Of Which US Cotton 6.320 6.224 US Cotton Lifted Worldwide Since August 1 2.696 3.603 12.612 12.782</p>
<h3>American Cotton Maintenance Policy</h3>
<p>Organizing a Cotton Industry Maintenance Society... Receiving Cooperative Group Cotton A dispatch from New York on the 6th reports that the Federal Farm Board, based on the report on the current emergency state in the American cotton market issued by the Cotton Advisory Committee, announced that it will organize a Cotton Industry Maintenance Society. Its methods are the same as those used previously for the organization to maintain the wheat market. It is reported that this society will receive the surplus cotton from 1929 currently stockpiled by cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Survey of Yarn Inventory at the End of May</h3>
<p>Chinese and English Yarn Decreased... Japanese Yarn Increased A survey of yarn inventory at the end of May shows a total of 87,372 bales, a decrease of 3,440 bales compared to April. Among them, Chinese and English yarn totaled 79,112 bales, a decrease of 6,930 bales. Japanese yarn totaled 8,260 bales, an increase of 3,490 bales.</p>
<h3>Grain: Foreign Rice Pours In and Then Recedes by 2 Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice continued to arrive in port. Because the strikes in the Rangoon and Yangon areas had been resolved, all of the accumulated rice was being shipped. For several consecutive days, the sudden influx has affected sentiment. The market is sluggish, and merchants' appetites are weak. Yesterday, Jiangxi, Hangshao, inland native streets, and others were procuring, but the quantities were small, and prices fell back by about 2 jiao. The opening prices were: No. 1 Saigon 4,000 bags at 16 yuan 1 jiao to 15 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen; Small Twist 1,500 bags at 15 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen to 15 yuan 2 jiao; Also, Coarse Rice 500 bags at 14 yuan to 13 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen; Min Dang 500 bags at 15 yuan 4 jiao 8 fen; No. 2 Saigon 1,000 bags at 15 yuan 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Suddenly Becomes Chaotic</h3>
<p>Following a surge, a correction is typical. Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, sentiment for June and July remained high, with June reaching a high of 2 taels 5 qian 4 fen 2 li 5 hao, and July reaching 5 qian 1 fen 5 hao. However, major players took the opportunity to sell, and after a surge, a correction is typical. As a result, the market suddenly became chaotic. August's opening price was unstable, and prices for September and later followed suit. Over the past week, the market's sharp rise in flour prices has no real justification in terms of the flour itself. Instead, speculative bulls have simply seized the opportunity and tried to artificially inflate prices. When each contract opened in the afternoon, the bulls continued to sell, and the market remained unstable with signs of further declines. However, as buyers emerged again due to the high excitement, prices recovered slightly, but the declines from the previous day's high were still quite large. As a result, the price for the current month was down by 2 li 5 hao from the previous day, July was down by 1 fen 7 hao 5 si, August was down by 2 fen, September was down by 3 fen, and November was down by 1 fen 5 hao each.</p>
<h3>Near-Term Wheat Prices Firm, Long-Term Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>Not much new wheat has arrived... Old wheat has also risen by 3-5 fen. Yesterday, the wheat futures market presented a picture of near-term firm prices and long-term weakening. Although new wheat from domestic producing areas is gradually entering the market, transportation is not as smooth as in previous years. As a result, the arrival of goods is limited, and manufacturers' demand is quite urgent. Therefore, enthusiasts are again actively buying, and the market is particularly firm and buoyant. In the long-term months, as buyers shifted and sellers became active, prices weakened. If there are no problems with transportation in the future, this trend may ease slightly. As a result, June was up 4 fen from the previous day, July was up 3 fen, August was up 2 fen, September was down 2 fen, October was down 1 fen, and November was down 2 fen. In the spot wheat market, new and old wheat of all grades were shouting up 3-5 fen again due to manufacturers' strong demand. Old Suzhou, Bengbu, and Qingjiangpu wheat opened at 5 taels 1 qian 2 fen, and Chenzhou old wheat was 4 taels 5 qian 5 fen or 4 taels 5 qian for 4,500 bags. New wheat such as Penglai Zhen wheat was 4 taels 7 qian 5 fen, Outer Gang wheat was 4 taels 7 qian 2 fen, Shuangfeng wheat was 4 taels 7 qian, 4 taels 6 qian 5 fen, 4 taels 6 qian, 4 taels 5 qian, Luodian wheat was 4 taels 5 qian 5 fen, and Baoshan wheat was 4 taels 5 qian, totaling 2,500 bags.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Taikoo's Refined Sugar Suddenly Opens at 20,000 Bags</h3>
<p>There's Sharp Rise in Market for Dutch Red Sugar, and National Sugar Rises 3 Qian, but It Doesn't Happen Yesterday, the sugar market received a telegram from the producing area stating that the current price of Cuban sugar is 1.5, up 0.0625 from the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for September were at 1.480, down slightly by 2 points; December at 1.58; May of next year at 1.66; and September at 1.73, all down 1 point. There were no telegrams from the Java sugar market. Due to the approaching weekend, the Public Association could not ship coarse white sand, and the buying sentiment was subdued. Sellers called for a price of 7 taels 7 qian 5 fen, but there were very few transactions. The Dutch Red Sugar market was quite bullish, with No. 10 goods selling briskly at 6 taels 3 qian. The markets for medium white sand and others were as they were the day before. Sugar YRO sold slightly at 8 taels 1 qian 5 fen, YTM was calling for 8 taels 5 qian, and YP was calling for 8 taels 6 qian 5 fen, but there were also few inquiries. Since opening 2,000 bags, the National Sugar has been calling for a price increase of 3 qian, but no transactions have been made. Taikoo's Refined Sugar opened yesterday for delivery in June and July, totaling 20,000 bags. HX was at 8 yuan 05 fen, and B was at 8 yuan 5 jiao, with other grades adding to the price as usual. It is based on Hong Kong silver dollars, and the procedures are very complicated. After the sale was announced, HX was asking for 8 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen, and B was asking for 8 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen. At that moment, there was little hope of transactions.</p>
<h3>Significant Rise in Prices of American and British Plain Galvanized Iron</h3>
<p>Since the sharp decline in foreign exchange rates, the cost of imported goods in this port has soared, and the prices of various hardware items have also steadily increased. For example, American and British plain galvanized iron have seen price increases as high as three or four taels. Currently, American 48-sheet iron is priced at 19 and a half taels, and there is still a shortage of available stock. Other 28-gauge iron is sold at 18 and a half taels, 26-gauge at 17 taels, and 24-gauge at 14 taels. Transactions in the Yangtze River, inland rivers, and this street are very brisk. In addition, the "Flying Crow" iron in English galvanized iron has also seen a very smooth trend recently, with an asking price of 17 and a half taels, and the price of thick patterned iron has also increased by one or two taels per dan. However, transactions in the northern route have been sluggish due to the rapid increase in prices. According to industry insiders, the recent arrivals of American and British plain galvanized iron are limited. If the foreign exchange rate does not improve, there is likely to be a continued increase in prices in the future.</p>

<h3>The Charity Drama Movement Has One Day Left</h3>
<p>The Xinyou Drama Troupe held a charity drama movement. Last month, on the 31st, they performed "(Uncle Vanya)." Yesterday, they performed "(The Dog's Dance)." The results were very satisfactory. The stage technology was, of course, superior to many others, especially the actors' expressions and tones, which reached the pinnacle of perfection. Mr. Yuan Muzhi can be said to be unparalleled for a time. Misses Jie Rong and Gu Zhen, and Mr. Wang Xiawen also performed admirably. Today is the last day, with the famous drama "(Peach Blossom Spring)." The original author, Saneatsu Mushanokōji, has long been renowned. The performer, Mr. Zhu Rangcheng, has also put in a lot of effort. It is said that many tickets have been sold by Uchiyama Bookstore, which shows the admiration of the Japanese community in Shanghai for Mr. Mushanokōji and Mr. Zhu. Zhai Hanli (played by Yuan Muzhi) in "The Dog's Dance".</p>
<h3>Stage Technique of "(Uncle Vanya)" - By Cao Yin</h3>
<p>In the long-depressed and now-exciting Chinese drama scene, the Xinyou Drama Troupe's "(Uncle Vanya)" was performed twice in a row at the Central Auditorium. I love drama - especially this type of drama - so I was always one of the audience members for their two performances.</p>
<p>However, although I love drama, I am an outsider to it, so I dare not comment on whether the actors' expressions and techniques are good or bad. However, I have a few words to say about their stage technology.</p>
<p>(1) Scenery: We know that good acting is important for a play to be well-done, and the realism of the scenery is also a component of it. "(Uncle Vanya)" is a four-act play, so there are four different sets of scenery. What I like most is the first act, in front of a quiet rural dilapidated cottage, with two trees growing next to it. Opposite the house is a small garden, full of lush greenery, which is really lovely. Sitting in the audience, I forgot that I was sitting in my seat and felt as if I was in the scene. The scenery was so well done that I really wanted to say, "It's a sight to behold!" The rest, such as the dining room in the second act, the living room in the third act, and the office in the fourth act, were all flawless to look at, which is really commendable.</p>
<p>(2) Music: Music is a great help in a drama. It can lift the spirits and interest of the audience in a dull play. "(Uncle Vanya)" is a sentimental drama. There is nothing in the whole play that can make the audience feel interested. If there was no beautiful music to regulate the melancholy atmosphere, I am afraid that the audience would not be able to sit comfortably until the end of the play. But their music was really good - and I'm not just saying that because I saw musicians such as Tan Shuzhen, Zhu Xisheng, and Yu Yuezhang - when the melodious and gentle tones were gently sent to my ears, to be honest, I was really "captivated."</p>
<p>(3) Props: Props are the most complicated part of a play. It is not easy to make them "orderly" and "logical". The props in "(Uncle Vanya)" were not particularly good, but not very bad either. However, a Samovar was seen in the first act, in the second act, and in the third act. I don't understand why they relied on it so much, or whether they had other intentions. I don't know.</p>
<p>(4) Makeup: If you want a play to be well-done, the actors' individual skills are very important, but without good makeup, the true spirit cannot be fully expressed. What I am most satisfied with in the Xinyou Drama Troupe's "(Uncle Vanya)" is the makeup. If I didn't know in advance, I would really think Yuan Muzhi's Wei Yiwen (Uncle Vanya) was Russian. His facial makeup and clothing were all lifelike. The most strange thing is that his shoes were not Chinese style either, I'm afraid he bought them from a Russian old-fashioned shop. The makeup of Hong Meiqing's Hailan, Luo Mingfeng's Shili, and Tang Yuanfan's Dr. Zhao were all very similar. I can say that their makeup skills have reached the "realm of transformation." However, Li Ma's clothes were the same in all four acts, and I didn't see her change them. I don't know what their intention was.</p>
<p>(5) Lighting: Although the scenery is good, if there is no proper lighting to set it off, it is like a peony without green leaves to support it, losing its brilliance. "(Uncle Vanya)" is one outdoor scene and three indoor scenes, so their lighting changes with the place and time of the play. They use harmonious and quiet light to reflect the beauty of nature, which is truly "ingenious". Especially in the third act of the second performance, the sunlight shone on the wall with a spotlight. If my wisdom had not escaped from the surprise, I would have thought that the real sunlight was shining on the wall. Also, the lightning in the second act was very similar. I saw with my own eyes a seven or eight-year-old girl sitting next to me covering her little ears with her hands after the lightning flashed. This shows the effort they put into the lighting.</p>
<p>(6) Effects: Effects are of great help to the plot. They can make the plot particularly realistic. This is an indispensable thing in acting. I am also satisfied with the effects in "(Uncle Vanya)". For example, the birdsong in the first act (maybe it was real birdsong), the night watchman's drum in the second act, the thunder, rain, and wind, the gunshot in the third act, and the horse bell in the fourth act, made people never think that they were made by humans. However, sometimes the thunder was too rapid and the gunshot was a double shot, which was a little unsatisfactory, but it did not cause any major problems for the whole.</p>
<p>Now that I have finished what I wanted to say, I have to stop. But finally, I want to say to the Xinyou people: your performance can be said to have been successful. Your spirit and your perseverance are worthy of admiration and praise. Your responsibility is not only in your own success, you must bear the burden of improving modern drama and developing modern drama. Your future is bright, so members of Xinyou, do not "remain in your own world." You must continue to work hard towards your bright future!</p>
<h3>Fragments of Life in Nanggong CA</h3>
<p>I often see the beautiful lives of the palace mistresses in Donggong in this column, and I often hear about the joy and happiness of the palace mistresses in Xigong. Because Jinan University is located in Zhenru Town, it has not received much attention.</p>
<p>The palace is named Nangong for two reasons: one is that they all come from the southern district and are beautiful women from the south, and the other is that the school is named Jinan University, and the palace where they live is naturally Nangong.</p>
<p>Because eight out of ten of the palace mistresses in Nangong have returned from overseas, their lives are different from those of the local ladies. Although the local ladies account for only one or two out of ten, they are softened by the environment as soon as they enter the deep palace.</p>
<p>They have a spirit of courage and righteousness, and they also have a strong and lively physique. Not to mention that the palace mistresses in the overseas palace cannot match them, even the strong men in Jiangnan will retreat when compared with them. In the early morning when the sun is rising, they wear short socks that are only as long as their lower legs, tie on thin silk skirts that cover their knees, and expose most of their tanned calves. Holding tennis rackets or basketballs in their hands, they rush to the playground with a ferocious momentum. If you meet a palace mistress from Donggong or Xigong at this time, I guarantee that you will fall down "thump" unconsciously.</p>
<p>They live in Nangong very leisurely. They get up very early every day. When the bell rings six times, many of them leave their beds. Because they go to bed early in the morning</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>June 8, 1930, Republic of China (Shen Bao Second Edition) Sunday (8)</p>
<p>Because of the early start, they also go to bed very early. After 9 o'clock, one by one, they go to the land of sweet dreams, but there are also those who sleep late for special reasons, such as driving at night to write Love Letters.</p>
<p>Recently, two things were discovered in their palace that are quite amusing. The former is a manifestation of their cherishing time, and the latter is a playful and arrogant wit. Now write below.</p>
<p>A unique way of refusing guests: There is a note on the door of a certain palace that says: (Self-study time, no guests. Guests, please respect yourselves. Face-to-face refusal is uncivilized.) The words are written very large, probably to call for special attention.</p>
<p>Unnamed Drama Club: One morning, a large poster-style declaration was suddenly discovered in the palace, written in red and blue ink in a flower-adorned regular script. The general idea is: (We have organized this Unnamed Drama Club for the sake of art, for the sake of beauty, for the sake of seizing youth, and for the sake of preserving innocence. We hope that students will join enthusiastically.) Most of the space below is blank for writing the names and dormitory numbers of those who join. On the morning of the second day, the bright and eye-catching declaration was still posted, but the names at the signature were added a lot. Probably they wrote the names in Javanese, Dutch, and Siamese. It looks very interesting. It originally said: (Named but no surname, Dormitory 20 of this school) (Anonymous, No. 91, Dormitory 20 of this school) (Ya La Zhenru, Rich Villa). Looking at the declaration of the Unnamed Drama Club, there are a few small characters written below: (Down with the Unnamed Drama Club of Factionalism)</p>
<h3>Busy to Death - The Girls of Peicheng</h3>
<p>The matter of the Peicheng girls performing "(The Lady's Fan)" has been published in this newspaper long ago. What I want to talk about here is their "busyness." Now that the dates of their performance - the 16th and 17th - are gradually approaching, they are getting busier and busier. The three kinds of busyness described below, although they don't mean much, can show their spirit of sacrifice for art. We cannot but praise them.</p>
<p>1. Rehearsal: Any drama troupe will be busy rehearsing in the days before the performance. Of course, the Peicheng girls can be seen gathering together to practice. After school, they are still rehearsing. They even sacrificed Saturday afternoons and Sundays to do their drama work diligently. With such continuous efforts, the results in the future are of course within our expectations.</p>
<p>2. Making clothes: Because the costumes of the characters in the play need to be very fashionable, they are all busy cutting and making new clothes, spending dozens of gold on it. I think that the tailors in the future should also burn incense and pray to the young ladies to show some mercy and do a few more dramas.</p>
<p>3. Selling tickets: This time, the location of their performance is the Summer Pacific Cinema. Because the rent is too expensive, their admission tickets have also risen to one yuan and two yuan. This is also a last resort. In order to sell more admission tickets, they are busy selling them everywhere.</p>
<h3>Recent Two Exhibitions at Jinan University</h3>
<p>Zhu An: Jinan University has had many recent events, such as concerts, commemorative meetings, and amusement fairs, etc. But apart from these, there are two exhibitions worthy of attention. From these two exhibitions, we can infer the Jinan University students' love of learning, hard work, and their various characteristics, which is the true spirit of the highest institution of learning for overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(1) Biological specimen exhibition: This time, the Biology Department of the College of Science traveled to Tiantai Mountain to collect specimens. Dozens of teachers and students participated. They spent two weeks collecting hundreds of various biological specimens, large and small, almost all of them. The most special ones are large birds and rare insects. Now they have all been washed and completely open to the public. The exhibition site is on the left side of the Hongnian Library of the school. The exhibition will be held for three days starting from the 9th. We hope that people from all walks of life will visit and give guidance.</p>
<p>(2) Exhibition of the Chinese Painting Research Association: Jinan University originally had a Department of Chinese Painting and a Department of Western Painting, but they were closed down one after another due to financial reasons. Some of the students also transferred to other departments, but they still did not give up their research on painting and continued to work hard. So, the Chinese Painting Research Association was established. The achievements in the past two years are indeed good. Now it is scheduled to be exhibited on the 9th and 10th of this month on the second floor of the Hongnian Library.</p>
<h3>Zhongda Will Hire a Sports Instructor</h3>
<p>Not long ago, the Jiangda Games opened, and as a result, the Central University, which ranked fourth last year, jumped to first place. Needless to say, everyone related to the Central University was beaming with joy, and even the general public thought that this was a good phenomenon in the sports world. However, the authorities and students of the Central University did not feel satisfied. When the news of China's惨 defeat in the Far East Games reached the school, the whole school was filled with sighs. President Zhang Naiyan, PhD, in view of this failure, which was not due to the athletes' lack of effort, but due to the lack of good guidance in peacetime, the fundamental solution is to hire a qualified instructor in this field. However, the school's funds are only enough to cover expenses, and it is difficult to find a good instructor in a country with backward sports. It is indeed very difficult to invite a famous sports instructor from Europe and the United States. However, President Zhang did not give up his plan because of the school's financial difficulties, and because of President Zhang's efforts, it is about to be realized. It is said that the intended appointee has been decided, Mr. Mike Lele (Boliang).</p>
<h3>Prometheus Society of Central University</h3>
<p>Xian Rong: Before the reorganization of Central University, when it was still Nango and Dongda, its students indeed had the virtue of modesty with regard to (desire for publication) - for example, they said (we have not yet achieved anything, we have nothing to publish, and we are not qualified to publish). But now that Central University has been reorganized from Nango and Dongda, there has been a big turning point. This vivid turning point has clearly divided our school into two eras. The former era is the old one, and the current one is undoubtedly the new era. Because of the advent of the new era, its students have imperceptibly changed their thinking. Taking (desire for publication) as an example, it used to be calm, but now it is enthusiastic. Because of the current enthusiasm, many literary societies and research associations (whose purpose is, of course, to research and publish publications) have also emerged. Prometheus is one of them.</p>
<p>The Prometheus Society was organized by several students of our school. It is said that Prometheus is a Roman fire god. The society takes the name Prometheus to express the members' longing for the raging fire, their spirit will be as fierce as the raging fire, and they will strive to break the current depressing scene in general society. In addition, the Prometheus Society published a few issues of the Prometheus Literary Weekly in the supplement of the Central Daily News last season, but later, due to the summer vacation and the dispersal of the members, the club's affairs were temporarily suspended. It is now heard that the members of the club will revive their banner and expand the club's affairs. It is divided into two departments: social science and literature and art. A declaration will be published soon to solicit members.</p>
<h3>Guidelines for Youth Field Submissions</h3>
<p>(1) Articles should cover discussions on youth issues, domestic and foreign school or student news, essays, descriptions of school life, essays, etc., with no restrictions on style.</p>
<p>(2) Illustrations should be limited to youth issues.</p>
<p>(3) Photographs of youth life (such as sports, travel, excursions, drama performances, lectures, gatherings, exhibitions, various competitions, etc., school news, and photography of youth movements) are welcome, whether individual or group.</p>
<p>(4) Do not write on both sides of the manuscript paper.</p>
<p>(5) The length of each article should not exceed 2,000.</p>

<h3>Zhongling Printing Machine in the Public Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Our country's technology has always been considered immature, and invention is rare. However, the Zhongling air-pressure printing machine newly produced by the Hanli Company in this port has been welcomed by all walks of life since its invention. After improvement, the factory was established in Jiangwan Road, Zhabei. The machines are widely distributed and the products are well-made. In less than a year, the sales of the printing machine have spread throughout the country, and the business is booming like spring flowers. The printing results of the machine have been praised by important officials and famous literary scholars (as seen in the fourth issue of the pictorial weekly of this newspaper). Now, the managers of the company, Zhong Yu, Chen Nansun, and the two gentlemen, for the purpose of widespread promotion, have added the Zhongling printing machine to the Shanghai Public Art Exhibition. The director of the Education Bureau sent a letter of welcome as follows: "Respectfully, I have just received your letter, and I am aware of everything. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to promote the domestically-produced Zhongling printing machine at the Public Art Exhibition and for being willing to bear all printing responsibilities within the venue. It shows your deep enthusiasm, and I admire you. What you said will be followed accordingly. In addition to designating a room for your company's office at that time, I will reply to you accordingly.
