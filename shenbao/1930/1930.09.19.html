<p>世界失業之人日多由於商業之衰落商業之衰落由於機器日益精良出貨日多而供過於求故欲挽救商業之衰落根本在出貨減少然出貨減少則失業之人勢必更多故須於製貨之外移其人工於非製貨之工作提倡建築即移人工人於非製貨之一端也蓋建築為不動產非如流動貨物之能推銷於各處市場者故雖有一地方受其影響而决不至影響於全局故於救濟世界商業衰落之諸計劃中較為切實而根本者也</p>
<p>此其議之始創者為美國今意國之救濟失業政策中亦有增築道路及建築公共工程之議英國亦然衛生部率政府專家與自由黨領袖共同討論住屋問題蓋以此為救濟失業大計劃之一部也總之世界可以生產而非製造貨物之工作甚多决非僅僅建築一端救濟失業之人而能於此着想成為世界一種風行之習如以前之製貨然不但失業之問題可以解决即商業衰落問題亦可連帶解决已</p>

<h3>政府尚有難題</h3>
<p>國防缺陷不能不謀補充</p>
<p>實現减稅負有重大責任</p>
<p>電通社十八日東京電昨日第十二次精查委員會無條件通過倫敦條約案開會時伊東委員長起立謂政府所提示之審查材料雖不滿足然鑑於本條約案之重大性須避免審查不能之結論關於材料不足之點予意以信賴政府之說明謀打開局面為妥當言畢主張審查不能之委員亦察知大勢不敢反對伊東委員長更繼續謂關於條約案之逐條審議二上書記官長已審查一次政府方面之逐條說明書亦於二上書記長審查之際調查完畢委員會擬省略逐條審議即决定可否滿場無異議乃付表决於嚴肅空氣之裏滿場一致並未附何等附帶條件通過條約案於是伊東委員長提出（一）委員會之報告書大綱（二）經本會議奉答之上奏文之大綱請求諒解於二時五十分散會委員會之報告文俟伊東委員長與二上書記官長正式作製後於二十五日再開一次委員會决定之十月一日即開御前會議當日亦可望無何等波瀾而通過之又上奏文本應在本會議根據報告書即議决者而伊東委員長昨在委員會所要求諒解上奏文之大綱案其內容如下一條約簽字之際政府之處置雖不無遺憾之點然信賴政府之說明承認條約之內容二補充計畫及减稅計畫如認為滿足當然批准云視其所用之字句如何可視為附以條件關於此點樞府方面謂係附以理由而議决並非附以條件然减稅計畫與補充計畫如認為滿足二語是將實行上之責任完全轉嫁於政府與軍部政府方面故仍嚴加戒備講求對策</p>

<p>電通社十八日東京電倫敦海軍條約案因樞府委員會急轉直下態度豹變�</p>
<p>御批准之難關完全一掃今後之問題在於如何處置補充計畫與减稅政府方面以對軍部曾承認國防確有缺陷遂不得不容納根據海軍方面專門見解之要求但條約簽字之目的其主眼在於輕减國民負担故對實現减稅有最大之責任又不得不將海軍保留財源用於减稅一方海軍方面之要求即軍部之補充計畫案達七億元之巨額海軍省案亦有四億元之多而其要求態度頗為強硬軍部謂由國防上之見地絕對不能讓步故减稅與補充計畫有樞府問題以上之難問題云</p>

<h3>模範軍人羅先闓</h3>
<p>— 方二</p>
<p>旬日以來京中湖南同鄉駭汗相告莫非此次長沙共軍騷亂之事有談及模範軍人羅先闓者為書其事</p>
<p>羅先闓者長沙東鄉人幼以孤寒為牧豬牛偶不慊於主人即憤而丐食四方旋隨軍為伙伴久之改充兵卒最後積功至為旅長蓋已轉徙行伍出入戰陳近四十年矣彼常以其所經歷津津樂道於人且自謂貧無立錐不塡溝壑得有今日之寶貴於願已足人亦以此多之當彼為旅長時湖南當局適有裁兵之議彼即首請解甲歸田為諸將倡一陸輿論有模範軍人之稱良以彼之職位僅至旅長擁財不及百萬遽自以為富貴過望知止而退在現代軍人中實不多見也</p>
<p>彼築別墅於長沙城西湘江中之水陸洲夏日於此避暑冬則遷歸故鄉常獨自携錢入城荷貨物回家粗服布鞋宛然鄉老車夫舟子知其為羅旅長莫不爭先招致冀有數十百文之賞賜也</p>
<p>彼雖年六七十望之如五十許以湘中宿將又年高故同鄉軍官自程潛趙恒惕以次皆尊呼之為定老彼字定安猶北洋軍人呼段芝泉之為芝老也即彼之老長官譚畏公亦對之彌加尊敬焉</p>
<p>彼自退隱後湖南當局雖不復以軍職相加然自趙恒惕時代以來仍以長沙團防及湖南全省清鄉督辦二團防總辦相付託湖南團防自曾國藩以迄現在即擅殺戮一縣有無數團防分局即有無數殺人機關省縣總局及省縣當道皆無如之何亦置不過問蓋為倚以勦匪計也剷共以來湖南團防殺人不可勝紀此次共黨入長沙得團防總辦羅先闓而甘心焉鳴呼共匪之報復手段亦云慘矣</p>

<p>呑梨　校長挾梨與書歸室召女而詢之女自矢無他校長亦遂不究女雖知梨之可貴而校長未及亦不敢言於是校長及近侍諸人得飽嘗故鄉風味矣</p>
<p>尾聲　近侍有碩人食之而飽笑述於人女左右思維意良不愜乃毅然往詢校長擬索還餽贈之物校長則亂以他語囑其緩議必查出以償女退但不知以偽亂眞時此南方之人能囑而哇之否也</p>

<h3>心上溫馨（二八○）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>太太起了疑心。便想起有種種破綻。那個茶房去了以後。便吩咐家裏一切人。老爺回來的當兒你們不詐說什麼話。你們不許告訴他。說阿土來過。僕人傭婦自然都聽太太指揮。因為太太的權力。比老爺大。當見老爺被太太所呵斥。他嘴也不敢回。及至老爺十二點鐘回家。大家一聲兒不響。只聽太太似法院裏的推事一般。審問口供。太太吸足了一口烟。問道。今天的船到得遲啊。章乙青道。還沒有到南京。就遇着大霧。怎樣也吹不散。我們的船。是不敢在迷霧中冒險走的。所以整整停泊了江心一日一夜。這時一家人都掩口壼盧而笑。連裝烟的大姐阿寶。因為太太監視甚嚴。也不敢給而老爺遞眼色。太太笑了一笑道。那末你就給迷霧迷住了。停了一停道。有人告訴我說昨天就看見你在上海了。乙青倒怔了一怔。連忙辯道。那裏有這事。昨天還在長江裏。是誰看見我的。在什麼地方。眞正活見鬼。但是他說雖如此說。也有些嘴硬骨頭穌。因為昨天的確出來過白天到後馬路某錢莊去了一趟。晚上在一個朋友人家打牌。一直打到一點鐘回到小公館裏去的。太太正是一個絕好的法官。問口供不慌不忙。又吸了一口烟。說道。因為你趁的船。是昨天就進口的了。有人告訴我。所以我說你是昨天就回的了。章乙青想。原來是冒工。因笑道。原來如此。你可知道我不是趁原船回來的。我是趁招商局的江寬回來的。他旣是一個輪船買辦。自然熟悉於第天什麼輪船進口的了。這時裝烟的阿寶。暗想這個回答。倒有點聰明。但是不要再露出馬脚來綫好。伊那時好像陪着被告在法庭上的律師。又不能敎唆他的口供。又怕他說差了話。眞是給他揑了一把汗。但是那問官眞有意思。說你旣趁了那條船去。怎麼不趁了原船回來呢。章乙青道。因為漢口行裏。有筆賬要給我算一算。大班呌我留住一天。也只好留住一天了。他想這話說得冠冕堂皇。掮出外國大班來壓伊。再沒有什麼說的。却不知道自己把趁了那條船去的事。在问官面前肯定了。太太又問。我從前薦的那個茶房阿土。不是在那條船上嗎。你見到他嗎。阿寶想。倘使說沒有見到。事還有救。偏偏章乙青要想見好於太太。說道。見到見到。那個人做事倒還勤謹。</p>

<h3>粉市疲乏無神</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後各月份大致趨穩定盤旋之態因洋麥報價出入無幾致業外之空頭隨巿均有補進故表而彷彿已轉穩象但環境如是暗中仍覺虛疲迨至下午開盤後近遠各期又覺步呈穩懈其衝動之主因厥為全市重落對外之匯率逐步放長彷彿於洋麥之訂購予以良好之合划因此大小廠家凡已經開始訂購洋麥者均又紛紛拋出以致人心大虛自十一月份以次均跌進四義關口此種情形完全為國外所牽動恐後步匯率再長仍未許樂觀也結果本月份較前日跌一分半十月份跌一分七厘半十一·十二月份跌一分半正月份跌二分二月份跌一分半云</p>

<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Telegram Advocating for Peace</h3>
<p>Please have all parties cease hostilities to alleviate the people's suffering... All matters will await the Central Government's resolution.</p>
<p>Troops stationed in Yuguan are preparing to move out... Wang Shuchang appointed as Commander-in-Chief.</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Zhang Xueliang recently issued a telegram, the original text of which is as follows. All newspaper offices, please note: In order to build and develop, the first priority should be to eliminate warfare. To stabilize the nation, one must follow the will of the people. At the beginning of the internal strife, I, Liang, advised all parties not to resort to military force. My previous telegrams have been widely reported both domestically and internationally. The sincerity of my pleas has been heartfelt. The number of drafts not shown to the people of the country almost fills a room. Ultimately, due to my limited influence and insignificant words, I have been unable to reverse the disastrous situation. War has raged for seven months, with villages reduced to rubble and people suffering immensely. How can I bear to remain silent? If the war continues to drag on, it will inevitably lead to the destruction of lives and the ruin of the nation. There will be no way to remedy the situation, and regret will be futile. This is what I, Liang, am deeply concerned about. People cherish life and abhor death, sharing the same sentiments. They detest chaos and desire governance, holding the same aspirations. In my view, those who suffer hardship in the war zone are already miserable. Those outside the war zone who have been spared devastation also yearn for peace. I, Liang, have devoted myself to the Party and the nation, always prioritizing the protection of the people and the maintenance of unity. I cannot bear to see fellow countrymen suffer again. Therefore, I dare to offer my humble opinion based on my previous telegrams and the will of the people. I implore all parties to cease hostilities immediately to alleviate the people's suffering. As for resolving national affairs, there is a proper path to be taken. How should we remedy the current situation, what plans should we make for the long term, and how can we satisfy the people? All my colleagues should calmly await the Central Government's decisions. Wise individuals both domestic and international may express their views, jointly planning for long-term stability and security. If I, Liang, gain any insight, I will offer it promptly, hoping to contribute to the collective effort, with everyone working together to overcome the difficulties of the times. In this way, the people can be spared the suffering of displacement, and the nation's international standing can be maintained. This is my sincere hope. I earnestly present my case, hoping for your understanding and approval. Zhang Xueliang bows respectfully (Telegram dated the 18th).</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Zhang Xueliang telegraphed the entire nation on the 18th, advocating for peace, based on the Eastern Telegram's proposal, urging all parties to cease hostilities first to alleviate the people's suffering. As for resolving national affairs, there is a proper path to be taken. One should calmly await the Central Government's decisions and express their views to plan for long-term stability and security. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) Wang Shuchang, Chairman of Hebei Province, and Yu Xuezhong, Commander-in-Chief of the troops stationed in Pingjin and Yuguan, have been appointed. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) After the telegram was sent, the troops stationed in Yuguan were prepared to move out, with Wang Shuchang as the Commander-in-Chief. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government recently received telegrams from Fang Benren, Zhang Qun, and Wu Tiecheng, stating that Commander Zhang had issued a telegram yesterday, the content of which was to support the Central Government, promote unification, advocate for a cessation of hostilities, and await the Central Government's resolution. The telegram was titled "Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Party Headquarters and Governments of Various Provinces and Cities, and Various Commanders-in-Chief." The original telegram was very long and is expected to arrive in Nanjing sometime today or tomorrow. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9 PM, I met with a key figure in the National Government and inquired about Zhang Xueliang's telegram. According to the discussion, Zhang had been holding a cadre meeting in Shenyang for several days and had decided to issue a telegram supporting the Central Government. At the same time, he would send troops to Pingjin. The telegram was issued yesterday, but as of now, the government has not received it. Zhang's troops were also mobilized yesterday, divided into three army corps. In addition to the one army corps under Zhang's direct command, the other two army corps are Wang Shuchang's and Yu Xuezhong's, each with approximately 40,000 men, totaling 120,000. It is estimated that they will reach Pingjin sometime today or tomorrow. Yan's troops have withdrawn from Shijiazhuang, and Feng's troops are no longer a problem. The overall situation will rapidly improve. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Liuhe telegram dated the 18th confirms that the generals in the Northeast, including Commander Zhang, have unanimously resolved to support the Central Government, promote unification, and issue a telegram denouncing the rebels. They will also dispatch five divisions or more of troops to seize Pingjin, Jin, and Ji, causing a great shock. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Dadao News Agency reported that Zhang's telegram mainly stated that the nation is in turmoil and its diplomacy is declining. Now is the time for the country to recuperate and work together to face external threats. It is not appropriate for the war to prolong and cause a major disaster. He is determined to respect the Central Government's intentions and promote peace, and will immediately send troops along the Beining Railway to assist the Central Government. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Chonghui told people that Yan's army's withdrawal is indeed a fact. The Central Army's war on the Longhai and Pinghan lines is progressing smoothly, and Feng's army is also incapable of resisting. Now that Zhang Xueliang has telegraphed, advocating that everything be left to the Central Government's resolution, the situation can be resolved in a short period of time. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong, who attended the cadre meeting and went to Liaoning, returned to Shanhaiguan at 8 AM on the 17th, summoned the cadres of the 5th, 6th, 23rd, and 17th Infantry Brigades, the 1st Cavalry Division, and the 1st Artillery Regiment, and issued mobilization orders. (Telegram from the 18th, News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources, Zhang Xueliang will soon issue a telegram advocating for an immediate cessation of internal conflicts and the realization of a peace movement, based on the peace telegram he issued this spring and taking it a step further. This matter has been secretly told to Yan Xishan by Jia Jingde. Seeing that the situation is hopeless, Yan has decided to step down. His meeting with Feng Yuxiang was to decide how to deal with the aftermath after his departure and when to implement it. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The result of the Northeast meeting is a decision to express an attitude of armed mediation in the near future. Zhang Xueliang has ordered Yu Xuezhong's troops in Shanhaiguan to prepare to move out and will mobilize his own directly subordinate basic troops when necessary. Preparations have begun, and Hu Yukun has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief, and orders have been issued to the 2nd, 4th, and 12th Armies to prepare to move out. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Yu Xuezhong, who participated in the Northeast Four Provinces Supreme Cadre Conference, returned to the Shanhaiguan defense area at 8 PM on the 17th and immediately convened a military conference with his subordinates. As a result of the discussion, orders were immediately issued to the 23rd, 27th, 5th, and 6th Brigades, the 1st Cavalry Brigade, and the 1st Artillery Regiment to move out. Thirty train cars are being prepared between Shanhaiguan and Beidaihe, with a potential move towards the Xuzhou area. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Decides to Step Down</h3>
<p>Jin troops on the front line retreat to Shijiazhuang.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) External sources report that Yan Xishan's telegram on the 18th announces his resignation, and troops on the Jinpu Line are all withdrawing to Shijiazhuang. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan has returned to Shijiazhuang after meeting with Feng Yuxiang in Zhangde. (Telegram from the 18th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Shanxi military leadership conference in Dezhou was the motivation for urging Yan Xishan to decide to issue a resignation telegram. The conference decided on the following two items: (1) First, concentrate the Shanxi military forces in Shijiazhuang in order to preserve strength. (2) If the situation is urgent and Yan Xishan is not allowed to remain, then after consultation with Feng Yuxiang, entrust the Shanxi army to Zhao Daiwen and the Northwest Army to Lu Zhonglin, then step down and go abroad. Yan Xishan's decision to step down was made at this meeting. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person learned that Yan Xishan had decided to step down and went to see Wang Jingwei yesterday to inform him that the situation was hopeless and asked him what his plans were. Wang replied that the success or failure of events was not worth caring about, and he was extremely saddened. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Global Unemployment and Construction</h3>
<p>The number of unemployed people in the world is increasing daily due to the decline of commerce. The decline of commerce is due to increasingly sophisticated machines, which produce more goods, resulting in oversupply. Therefore, to save the decline of commerce, the fundamental solution is to reduce the production of goods. However, reducing the production of goods will inevitably lead to even more unemployed people. Therefore, in addition to manufacturing goods, we must shift labor to non-manufacturing work. Promoting construction is one way to shift labor to non-manufacturing work. Construction is immovable property, unlike mobile goods that can be sold in various markets. Therefore, although one place may be affected, it will not affect the overall situation. Therefore, among the various plans to remedy the decline of world commerce, this is a relatively practical and fundamental solution.</p>
<p>This proposal was first initiated by the United States. Now, Italy's unemployment relief policy also includes increasing road construction and building public works. The United Kingdom is the same, with the Ministry of Health leading government experts and Liberal Party leaders in jointly discussing housing issues, using this as a major plan to relieve unemployment. In short, the world has many jobs that can produce but not manufacture goods, and it is by no means limited to construction. If we can think about this and it becomes a common practice in the world, like manufacturing goods in the past, not only can the problem of unemployment be solved, but also the problem of commercial decline can be solved in conjunction.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Jin army on the Jinpu Line has been passing through Beiping in succession these days and is going to Shijiazhuang via the Pinghan Line. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The reasons for Yan Xishan's expression of intention to retire are due to (1) recognition that the attitude of the Northeast is bad, (2) discord with Feng, and (3) Shi Yousan's attitude becoming ambiguous. The Northeast's support for the Central Government is the most fatal blow. (Telegram from the 18th, News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Yan Xishan issued his telegram, the Jin Third Army, Wang Jingguo's unit, had already begun to withdraw to Shijiazhuang today. Other armies will also withdraw successively and have begun preparing to move. (Telegram from the 18th, News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In his telegram on the 14th, Yan Xishan informed key figures across the country, including Wang Jingwei, Xie Chi, Zhang Xueliang, and Tang Shaoyi, that he was willing to step down at this time and stop the war to save the people. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yan Xishan, knowing that the situation is hopeless and difficult to maintain, seems to have decided to step down and has deposited all his private property in foreign banks in Tianjin. From the 15th, he ordered the Central China Bank in Beiping to sell Shanxi currency, causing the price of Shanxi currency to plummet. Judging from the phenomena in other aspects, Yan Xishan's resignation may be realized immediately, and the issue of establishing a northern government will ultimately become a bubble. (Telegram from the 18th, Japanese League News Agency)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Government recently received a telegram from Liu Zhi in Luohe stating that since the capture of Jinan, the Yan rebels have been defeated, but the Feng rebel Yuxiang is still making a final struggle on the Longhai and Pinghan roads, and is using Song Zheyuan, Zhang Weixi, Ge Yunlong, Liu Ruming, Tian Jinkai, Zhang Yinxiang, and other rebel units and bandit armies to occupy areas such as Xuchang, Xiaoshangqiao, Xiangcheng, Yexian, Lushan, Jiaxian, Linyu, Yuxian, and Mixian to resist the progress of our army. I was ordered to transfer to the Pinghan Line at the beginning of the month and immediately supervised the units under my command to launch a general offensive against the enemy in that area. Our 5th Column successively recovered Baofeng and Linyu on the days of Geng and Hui. On the Zhen day, they recovered Ziyou County and are now approaching Longmen Street, 50 miles south of Luoyang, and are launching a fierce attack on Luoyang.

On the Shan morning, they conquered Dexian and are now advancing north. Our 3rd Column defeated the enemy in Quandiandun and Chuhezhen and occupied them on the days of Hanzheng, and are advancing to attack Xinzheng and Zhengzhou. Our frontline units have launched attacks on the enemy in front of them for days and have occupied the area north of Luoyang. In this battle, our army's columns fought bravely and killed countless enemies. Our 2nd and 4th Columns captured more than ten enemy brigade, regiment, and battalion commanders and more than 1,000 soldiers and more than 1,000 rifles.

In today's vote, 52 countries were present, and 4 countries abstained. Based on 48 countries, two-thirds would require 32 votes. Only 23 votes were in favor, 15 votes short. (1) Because they opposed China's admission one year early. (2) Because Asia already has two seats held by Japan and Persia and they were unwilling to give a third seat to China. (3) Because the right to be re-elected is in the middle, those who oppose it have been united for a long time and are not easy to break up. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese Telegraph Negotiations</p>
<h3>The Second Meeting Was Held Yesterday</h3>

The meeting adjourned at 7 PM. It is reported that our side proposed a negotiation plan and the Japanese side also proposed a counter-proposal for mutual reference. The two sides have not yet reached a consensus on which line to start with in the first step. The conversation at the meeting was very cautious, and it was translated sentence by sentence, so it took a long time. The details of the meeting are to be kept confidential by mutual agreement. Because the progress of this negotiation requires some consideration, it was agreed that the third meeting would be held on October 1 to discuss everything. (Telegram dated the 18th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Inquiry into Sino-Japanese telegraph negotiations reveals that the main points put forward by our side are: 1. First solve the Shanghai-Nagasaki line problem. 2. Reclaim the Taiwan-Fuzhou submarine line. 3. Jointly manage the submarine cable by China and Japan on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. 4. Build and develop Sino-Japanese telecommunications in the new era. The Japanese members intend to reconsider these points after returning to Shanghai and then discuss them further.

<h3>Proceedings of the League of Nations Assembly</h3>
<p>The Issue of Funding for the Pan-European Conference</p>
<p>Draft Convention on Financial Assistance to Invaded Countries</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (National Society): It is widely rumored here that the Pan-European Conference, which will discuss the plan for a European federation, can hold its first meeting in January next year, provided that the International League's Budget Committee can allocate funding. However, the Budget Committee is currently considering this funding issue, and there are concerns that difficulties may arise, causing the conference to be postponed.</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (National Society): The International Assembly's Disarmament Committee discussed today the draft convention on financial assistance to invaded countries. Due to differing opinions between Britain and France, a complete deadlock has been reached. The French aim is to allow the League of Nations to provide financial assistance to member states even when they are at war with non-member states. The British representative said that it is sufficient to issue a warning to all belligerent countries with this convention today, as the French representative's statement would entail unlimited obligations. Finally, the committee adjourned until tomorrow to continue discussions, hoping to make mutual concessions and negotiate a new proposal. The International Assembly's Social Committee also discussed more important cases on the agenda, such as the protection of youth, the suppression of opium smuggling, and the prohibition of the sale of women and children into slavery. Several senior naval officers from Italy have arrived here today to serve as consultants to the Italian delegation regarding the Italian-French naval negotiations. Therefore, general attention has once again turned to the future negotiations between Italy and France. It is also rumored that Italian Foreign Minister Grandi may arrive here tomorrow or Friday, at which point the negotiations between the two sides can enter their final stage.</p>
<p>Geneva, 17th (National Society): The Chinese delegation is extremely indignant about the results of the election of members of the Council of the League of Nations, claiming that China is the country with the largest population in the world and should occupy a seat on the Executive Council. One representative also said that although internal disputes in China have not ceased, certain countries also have internal strife and their populations are far smaller than China's, yet they still serve as members of the Council as before. Furthermore, a certain gentleman in the delegation said that someone had advised China in advance to give up its demand for the presidency of this session of the Assembly and engage in competition for membership of the Executive Council, which was deliberately intended to lead China astray. Geneva, 18th (National Society): The Japanese representative stated in the League of Nations Health Committee today that Japan is paying close attention to the construction of China's health organization and considers the work of the Singapore Health Committee to be particularly important, as that agency is in fact a clearinghouse for defending and investigating diseases in the Far East.</p>
<p>After Concessions by the Privy Council</p>
<h3>The Government Still Faces Difficulties</h3>
<p>Defense Deficiencies Must Be Addressed</p>
<p>The Responsibility for Achieving Tax Reduction is Heavy</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Electric News Agency): Yesterday, the 12th Detailed Review Committee unconditionally passed the London Treaty. At the meeting, Chairman Ito stood up and said that although the review materials presented by the government were not satisfactory, given the importance of this treaty, it was necessary to avoid a conclusion that the review could not be completed. Regarding the lack of materials, he believed that it was appropriate to trust the government's explanation to break the deadlock. The committee members who advocated that the review could not be completed also perceived the general trend and did not dare to object. Chairman Ito continued to say that regarding the article-by-article review of the treaty, the two senior secretaries had reviewed it once, and the government's article-by-article explanation was also completed during the review by the two senior secretaries. The committee proposed to omit the article-by-article review and immediately decide on whether it was acceptable. There was no objection from the entire meeting, and the vote was taken in a solemn atmosphere. The treaty was passed unanimously without any attached conditions. Then, Chairman Ito presented (1) the outline of the committee's report and (2) the outline of the memorial to the throne to be answered by this meeting, requesting understanding. The meeting adjourned at 2:50 PM. The committee's report will be finalized by Chairman Ito and the two senior secretaries and decided at another meeting on the 25th. It is hoped that the Imperial Conference on October 1 will also pass it without any turbulence. Furthermore, the memorial to the throne should have been decided at this meeting based on the report, but Chairman Ito requested understanding yesterday regarding the outline of the memorial to the throne in the committee. Its contents are as follows: 1. Although the government's handling of the signing of the treaty was not without regret, we trust the government's explanation and acknowledge the contents of the treaty. 2. The supplementary plan and the tax reduction plan will naturally be approved if they are deemed satisfactory. The wording used can be regarded as attaching conditions. Regarding this point, the Privy Council stated that the decision was made with attached reasons, not with attached conditions. However, the phrase "the tax reduction plan and the supplementary plan will naturally be approved if they are deemed satisfactory" completely transfers the responsibility for implementation to the government and the military. Therefore, the government is still on high alert and seeking countermeasures.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Electric News Agency): After the Privy Council meeting, the Minister of Finance and the Minister of the Navy waited at the residence of Prince Fushimi at 3:00 PM to report in detail on the proceedings of the Privy Council's Detailed Review Committee. They also said that if the treaty is approved, the government will pledge to complete the national defense supplementary plan in accordance with the response from the Military Council.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Electric News Agency): The London Naval Treaty has completely swept away the difficult hurdle of Imperial approval due to the Privy Council Committee's sudden change of attitude. The problem from now on lies in how to handle the supplementary plan and tax reduction. Because the government had admitted to the military that there were indeed deficiencies in national defense, it had no choice but to accommodate the demands based on the military's professional opinion. However, the main objective of signing the treaty was to reduce the burden on the people. Therefore, it has the greatest responsibility to achieve tax reduction and has no choice but to use the naval reserve funds for tax reduction. The military's demands, namely the military's supplementary plan, amount to a huge sum of 700 million yuan. The Navy Ministry's plan also amounts to more than 400 million yuan, and its attitude is quite strong. The military said that it absolutely cannot make concessions from the perspective of national defense. Therefore, the tax reduction and the supplementary plan pose a more difficult problem than the Privy Council problem.</p>
<h3>Italian Unemployment Relief</h3>
<p>Undertaking Public Works</p>
<p>Absorbing Unemployed Labor</p>
<p>Rome, 17th (National Society): The Italian Ministry of Labor, in view of the fact that the number of unemployed will inevitably increase as the agricultural harvest comes to an end, today issued an order to all provinces to increase the construction of roads and other public works in order to absorb unemployed workers. According to reports, public construction projects across Italy currently employ 60,000 laborers.</p>
<p>Milan (World Society): According to a report from the Italian Bureau of Statistics, the number of unemployed people in the country in June of this year was 322,287, an increase of 66.7% compared to the same month last year, and an increase of 30.5% compared to the same month in 1928. However, compared to the number of unemployed people in May of this year, it decreased by 44,896, presumably because more people were needed for agricultural work in June. According to historical statistics, June is the month with the fewest unemployed people each year, while January and February are the months with the most. Therefore, the authorities, aware of this unfavorable situation, although they know that it is not a unique situation in Italy but a common result of the global economic downturn and reduced production, have no choice but to urgently devise ways to provide relief. Prime Minister Mussolini has personally handled domestic immigration matters in order to reduce the number of unemployed people. His main policy is to provide work to all workers to the greatest extent possible and to avoid the wasteful and unproductive charitable relief funds of the state. He advocates employing unemployed workers in public works, such as adding railways and carrying out construction work in the earthquake-stricken areas. Not only can a large number of workers be employed directly, but various industries can also be developed indirectly. The government has now formulated public works construction steps. The first phase is to build post offices and dormitories for postal railway staff, costing 168 million lira and employing approximately 15,000 workers. The second phase is dedicated to health construction, building tuberculosis sanatoriums throughout the country, costing 100 million lira. The third phase is to plan the reclamation of wasteland and the construction of avenues. However, the state's tax collection will inevitably increase due to these various projects, and the Ministry of Finance is considering ways to generate revenue in detail.</p>
<p>Throughout Spain</p>
<h3>Censorship of News Abolished</h3>
<p>Except in Barcelona Province Due to Labor Unrest</p>
<p>Madrid, 17th (National Society): Throughout Spain, except for the province of Barcelona, censorship of news was lifted at 5:00 PM today. However, the implementation in that province has been temporarily postponed due to the ongoing strike by 50,000 construction workers. Because the labor unrest is currently fierce in that area, and workers in the docks are also feared to join, and because the number of unemployed people is increasing daily, Spain has no way to issue relief funds. The social situation is already precarious and uneasy, and there is talk that Catalan autonomists are taking the opportunity to incite labor unrest, so the situation is extremely serious.</p>
<p>Barcelona, 18th (Reuters): The Spanish government said that the general strike in Barcelona has a political nature. The manager and reporters of the Solidaridad newspaper have been arrested and the newspaper has been closed. The authorities have also ordered the arrest of members of the construction and transportation industry union committees, but everyone has fled into hiding. The streets are now deserted and no one is taking care of sanitation, so the army is performing street sweeping duties. The government has granted the governor-general full power to suppress the labor unrest.</p>
<p>Bombay Elections</p>
<h3>Members of the Legislative Assembly</h3>
<p>Women Block Entrance to City Hall</p>
<p>Police Arrive and Arrest Many</p>
<p>Bombay, 18th (Reuters): Today, during the election of members of the Legislative Assembly, many women joined hands to block the entrance to City Hall, and many men ridiculed those who voted. All were members of the Indian National Congress. Police arrived and arrested fifty women and twelve men. Calcutta, 18th (Reuters): Law student Majumdar has been sentenced to life imprisonment. Majumdar, aged twenty-eight, was accused of conspiring with the deceased Guputai to assassinate Police Chief Tagart and was accused of possessing bombs and military equipment.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Reuters): Charmanlal, a member of the Indian Parliament who strongly advocates for autonomy, refused to resign his seat in accordance with the resolutions of the National Congress at the beginning of the year and has now declined to participate in the Indian Round Table Conference.</p>
<p>German National Socialist Party</p>
<h3>Headquarters to be Moved to Berlin</h3>
<p>Munich, 18th (National Society): The victorious National Socialist Party today expressed fierce praise for its leader, Herr Hitler. Although Herr Hitler won a victory for his party, it is regrettable that he is an Austrian and cannot occupy a seat in Parliament. Herr Hitler also declared today that the National Socialist Party is not a parliamentary party in its ideology. Its goal is actually broader than this. However, in order to respect the Constitution, it has no choice but to use the path of Parliament to achieve its final day. The so-called "final day" is not backed by force, but is desired by a material revolution, which is to give the German people a spiritual cleansing and to strive for a victory for Germany in terms of personality. It is rumored that Herr Hitler plans to move the national headquarters of his party from Munich to Berlin, because that city is the center of all Germany. Although the people of Berlin tend to favor the Communist and Socialist parties, the majority of North Germany unanimously supports Herr Hitler and is more enthusiastic than South Germany.</p>
<h3>Important Documents Stolen in Bucharest</h3>
<p>Bucharest, 17th (National Society): Important military documents have been stolen in Romania and taken to Soviet Russia. Two generals have resigned today, having been accused of failing to take measures to protect secrets. The country is paying close attention to this case.</p>

<p>Paris, 18th (Pacific Society): France has decided to recognize the new government of Peru.</p>
<p>Argentina Capital City, 18th (Pacific Society): It is reported that Argentina's provisional government has been recognized by France.</p>
<h3>Polish Opposition Parties Protest Maltreatment</h3>
<p>Warsaw, 17th (National Society): Members of various opposition parties jointly formally protested to the Ministry of Internal Affairs today against the maltreatment of those arrested. According to the leaders of the various opposition parties, these people are imprisoned in ancient, dilapidated towers in the Brest-Litovsk fortress, and are subjected to harassment by venomous insects and mosquitoes. The Minister of Internal Affairs denied this, but said that Major Denyak, the most trusted subordinate of Piłsudski, is currently the commander of the fortress. Mr. Denyak is a well-known opponent of parliament.</p>
<h3>Japanese Inspection of Foreign Banks</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Electric News Agency): Recently, taking advantage of the financial instability, there has been propaganda that (investment in foreign debt and conversion into foreign currency deposits by mainland Chinese investors has increased sharply). The origin of this seems to be foreign banks, so the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry suddenly sent bank inspectors to inspect a powerful foreign bank branch in the Kansai region, causing a great shock to related parties. The Ministry of Finance said that because the inspection of domestic banks has been completed, they have begun to inspect foreign banks, which has no special significance. In fact, the results of the inspection can determine the reality of domestic capital investment overseas and easily study countermeasures to outflow of cash.</p>
<h3>Dutch Legislators Advocate for Reducing Government Expenses</h3>
<p>The Hague, 17th (National Society): After the Dutch Minister of Finance stated in Parliament that this year's budget will have a huge deficit and cannot have a surplus as in previous years, it has made a deep impression on the legislators. The opposition party claims that it will strive to reduce government expenses in order to avoid tax increases, and most newspapers also share this view.</p>

Approximately 30 foreign observers will attend, but the military attachés of France and Belgium in Germany have not been invited, because German military representatives were not invited when the armies of the two countries held maneuvers.</p>

<h3>Rapid Development of the British Aviation Industry</h3>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters): The world's business depression has naturally affected the air transportation industry. However, the profits of Imperial Airways in the year ending at the end of March exceeded £145,000, which is £30,000 more than the previous year. The company's directors have proposed a surplus of £85,000 for depreciation expenses due to the rapid development of the aviation industry and the constant progress in styles. The British-Indian route is very profitable, while the short-distance routes have less profit due to the competition from subsidized postal aviation companies in Europe.</p>
<h3>Large British Airship Under Construction</h3>
<p>London, 17th (Reuters): The largest British airship is currently under construction in Southampton.

<h3>Xiamen British Concession Notes Exchanged</h3>
<p>The British concession in Xiamen's Haihou Tan area is even smaller than the British concession in Zhenjiang. Now, Britain intends to express goodwill and has decided to return the land rights of the Xiamen concession to China for self-administration, according to China's wishes. Therefore, the British envoy met with Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting in Beijing several times, but other issues remained unresolved. Only the return of the Xiamen concession was completely agreed upon by both parties. Last week, it was decided to resolve the matter through an exchange of notes, as was done with the return of the Zhenjiang concession. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has already drafted the notes and revised them once the day before yesterday. Today (the 17th) at 4:00 PM, Foreign Minister Wang and the British envoy will sign and exchange the notes at the Diplomatic Residence. Regarding the content of the notes, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has adopted a secret strategy and will not disclose them. According to British propaganda, there are two notes exchanged, and the main points are: (1) The British government will completely transfer the municipal organs of the Xiamen concession to Chinese jurisdiction from the date of return, and all existing regulations for municipal administration will be abolished. (2) All lease contracts issued by the former British authorities will be cancelled and replaced with stamped deeds issued by the Chinese authorities, which will be transferred to each household through the British Consulate. No fees may be charged for the replacement of stamped deeds. (3) Before the National Government promulgates land tax regulations and before the new land tax laws are implemented in the Xiamen area, all annual rents payable by those who previously held British Royal Deeds will be temporarily collected according to the current tax items.

<h3>Communist Bandits Harass Jingdezhen and Xiajiang</h3>
<p>The Fang and Duan Factions Have Been Defeated</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Since Zhu De and Mao Zedong led communist bandits into Hunan, those remaining in Jiangxi were only the factions of Fang Zhimin in Mopan Mountain and Duan Qifeng and Li Shaojiu in Donggu and Gujiang. After Fang's bandits were defeated in Hukou and Duchang by the Anti-Smuggling Special Task Force and the 2nd Garrison Regiment, and then severely attacked head-on by the 297th Regiment of the 149th Brigade, they were in a very sorry state. Fang then led several thousand remaining bandits and hundreds of guns from Hukou, via the Jiangxi-Anhui border of Pengze, and invaded Fuliang Jingdezhen on the 8th of this month, carrying out wanton looting and causing great disturbance. This town is a famous porcelain production center in Jiangxi, with over 100,000 workers. In June, it was once captured by Fang's bandits, suffering a loss of over one million yuan. Before its vitality had recovered, County Magistrate Li Juede was detained in the Nanchang Municipal Public Security Bureau and sent to the High Court for punishment due to dereliction of duty. Before long, it was harassed by bandits again. In addition to ordering the 297th Regiment to cooperate with the 2nd Garrison Regiment to pursue and suppress the bandits from Hukou, Duchang, and Poyang, the military and political authorities also telegraphed the Training Regiment and the Zhu Mingtao Regiment entering Jiangxi from Zhejiang to encircle Fuliang from Yushan and Dexing, cutting off their return route to the old nest of Qigong Town, hoping to eliminate the bandits in one fell swoop. Because they had nowhere to go, the bandits also showed signs of fleeing into Anhui. Since the bandit Duan Qifeng of Gujiang had his lair destroyed by Deng Ying's forces, he desperately besieged Ji'an but suffered a disastrous defeat. Therefore, one faction fled from Jishui to Xiajiang and captured Xia City on the 11th, intending to cut off Deng Ying's rear route and the transportation between the province and Ji'an. After receiving the news, Commanders Lu and Zhang immediately dispatched a regiment of troops from the 18th Division to suppress them, setting off by car on the Nanzhang Road overnight to Zhangshu, and then advancing from Zhangshu via Xingan. However, when the troops arrived, the bandits had already fled far away. However, Xiajiang was originally a small county that was captured twice by bandits within a month. After the looting, arson, and murder, it was desolate. The Provincial Government previously received a telegram from the Commander-in-Chief ordering the construction of strong fortifications near Nanchang. Now, electrified wire networks and trenches have been completed one after another. Chairman Lu reported at the 314th meeting of the Provincial Government yesterday, saying that Generalissimo Chiang telegraphed ordering the construction of strong fortifications near Nanchang and hoped for their speedy completion. The deputy defense has been completed, but the trench project is huge and requires a lot of money. How should this be handled? After public discussion, it was decided that the expenses should be paid by the provincial treasury. As for the ten blockhouses that were planned to be built some time ago, they are still being planned and have not yet started. In addition, the Finance Department, considering that the expenses for military and police salaries are huge during the period of bandit suppression and that the provincial finances are extremely exhausted, ordered the Municipal Finance Bureau to borrow two months' rent from the city to provide funding, which will be returned when the provincial treasury is abundant.

<h3>Anti-Communist Rally Held in Changsha</h3>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: The Hunan People's Anti-Communist Propaganda Week rally was held this morning (the 15th) at the Provincial Education Association grounds. A high platform was set up in the center of the field, with a long table on the platform. The top of the platform was not covered with tiles, and there was no seat on the platform, to show the intention of enduring hardship and biding one's time. A portrait of the Premier was hung in the center of the platform, with the party and national flags crossed on both sides. A large rally flag was erected in the center of the field, about three or four zhang long and about three chi wide, with the thirteen characters "(Hunan People's Expanded Anti-Communist Propaganda Week Rally)" written on it in characters as large as a斗 (a dry measure), which was quite eye-catching. Arches were erected at the east and west gates as the exit and entrance of the rally. After 9:00 AM, people from all walks of life arrived in neat formations, and the roads around Yicun were blocked. The rally preparatory office sent Kuang Shushu and four others to guide the groups to enter the venue from the east gate, sign in, and then stand in order according to the sections of Peng Rongchu, Huang Fengqi, and four others from various sectors. Before long, the entire rally venue was full, with over two hundred groups signed in, reaching 30,000 people. He Jian and leaders from the party, government, and military circles all arrived on time. Chief Commander Hu Guochun announced the opening of the meeting and publicly elected He Jian as the chairman of the rally presidium. After performing the ceremony, preparatory committee member Liu Houmin first reported on the preparatory process. Next, He Jian was invited to report. He stated that there are many people attending the meeting today, and they are all very active in opposing the communists. The reasons why we oppose the communists are already known to us. Because the communist party's methods are too evil and their policies are too cruel, everyone has personally seen and heard them and they have long been imprinted in our minds, so there is no need to repeat them. However, some people are not yet clear, and they inevitably have some doubts because the communist party is communism. Today, I will analyze it based on the facts of their burning, killing, and looting, which can be divided into the following points: (1) Communism is a deception. When the communist bandits entered Changsha, they declared to the people that everyone should not be afraid, that the Red Army would not kill or burn houses, and only asked for a ransom of 700,000 yuan. The people had no choice but to try to raise the money to avoid burning and looting. This was not true. Even after the money was paid, some people were still robbed. In the end, they even transported the entire fire brigade and water dragons to Xiaowumen to prepare to set the entire city on fire and organized the Xiao Anti-Committee to prepare for a massacre. Is this kind of behavior a deception? (2) Communism is a fraud. The Communist Party declares that it supports the interests of farmers and workers and equally distributes land. Some farmers and workers were previously incited by them. This time, when I went to Liuyang, I conducted an on-the-spot investigation and met an old farmer who was about sixty years old. He said that he had been farming for more than thirty years and had saved eight mu of land. This time, the communist party confiscated and distributed four mu of land, which could produce twenty-four dan of grain. Those who are young and strong can divide six mu of land, but the harvest results can only yield six dan of grain, and the rest must be handed over to the Soviet government. Therefore, although it is nominally free of taxes, it is actually heavier than various taxes. How can a family of all sizes survive on six dan of grain? As for the workers, they have no land to divide, and their plight is even worse than that of the farmers. When asked why, they replied that the farmers were too busy making a living, so there was no work to give to the workers. For example, if the stool you are sitting on is broken, no one wants to repair or prepare it, but because the labor cost has increased, they cannot afford to hire someone, so they would rather not use it. From this, it can be seen that the communist party's distribution of land and support for the interests of farmers and workers is generally the same. Furthermore, the Communist Party's resolution only wants poor peasants and does not want rich peasants, and prevents poor peasants from becoming rich peasants. In other words, it wants the farmers to be proletarians forever and listen to their command, so that they will never have a chance to stand up. Therefore, it can be said to be a fraud. Can this kind of burning, looting, killing, deception, and fraud exist in the world? We should all make a final decision to strictly eliminate these inhuman and heartless beasts. As for the fact that Hunan was first ravaged by Zhang Guizhi and then burned and killed by communist bandits, I personally feel extremely distressed and very sorry to all the people of Hunan. But I want to declare that I am irreconcilable with the Communist Party no matter what. The Fourth Route Army is determined to fight the communist bandits to the death. Even if we calculate the officers and soldiers who died and were injured this time, there are hundreds of officers and countless soldiers, and there are also several brigade and regimental commanders. The reason why the Communist Party united the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 8th, 10th, 20th, and 28th armies from various places to attack Changsha fiercely was because they were ordered by the Soviet Union to capture Changsha first, and then invade Wuhan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Henan, and launch a national uprising. Now, the Fourth Route Army and the Gong and Luo divisions have defended Changsha and repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the bandits, and they have retreated to Tiaoma涧. However, we should know that although the communist bandits have now retreated, their power has not yet been eliminated, and the work of suppressing the communists cannot be relaxed. Only when they are completely eliminated can our responsibilities be considered fulfilled. There is one more thing I want everyone to pay attention to: we must distinguish between right and wrong, support justice. Everyone must know that the Communist Party and the rebels are tangible and relatively easy to defend against and suppress. However, those who are neither communist nor rebel and confuse right and wrong are not only difficult to defend against, but also extremely important and dangerous. I hope everyone will take out their impartial hearts and not create bad situations that will be criticized. That is my sincere hope. After He's speech, the speakers who followed included Li Faquan from the Provincial Party Department, Zhang Kailian from the Provincial Government Committee, Gong Bingfan, representative Chen Zaishi, acting Garrison Commander Guo Tao, Yan Gang representing Liu Jianxu, Huang Yanjun from the Municipal Party Department, Ding Ziqin from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from the municipal corps. They all generally encouraged all the people to rise up together, shoulder the responsibility of suppressing the communists, and be the backing of the armed comrades. We must know that it is a shame for the people of Hunan if the communist bandits are not eliminated, and we cannot survive if the communist party is not eliminated. We must have the determination to save ourselves and others to eliminate the communist bandits. After the speeches, three proposals were put forward and passed on the spot as follows: (1) Please ask the Clearing Township Headquarters to implement the order that those who protect bandits will be punished as bandits. (2) Please ask the government to establish the Changsha Municipal People's Anti-Communist Volunteer Team within a time limit. (3) It was proposed that five communist bandits, including Chen Guilin, be executed on the spot as a warning. Then, slogans were shouted and music was played to end the meeting. Appendix: Rally Circular Telegram (The communist party is rampant, poisoning the people, and Hunan Province has suffered the most. High flames are set to destroy houses into hills, and red flags are seen in the distance, turning people into ashes.</p>
<p>The bones of the people are withered. They use the tricks of poor bandits to empty nine out of ten households, and the instinct of owls and beasts is to kill brothers and fathers. Wherever the bandit trail goes, the mountains collapse and the water dries up. The alarm is spread, wives and children are separated. It is difficult to write down their ferocity, and it is impossible to wash away the wounds of our people. What's more, public wives are promiscuous, and shame is lost. Books are burned and cultural relics are destroyed. They show the insatiable behavior of beasts and destroy the nature of sentient beings. Morality is destroyed, and righteousness is lost. Their intention is to make the land of thousands of years of civilization sink into a realm of eternal destruction. If this is tolerable, what is intolerable? Previously, when Changsha fell, the bandits came and the world was dark, and the wind and clouds changed color. The burning, killing, and looting of extreme thugs tormented our people in fire and water. The devastation that lasted for ten days was truly an unprecedented catastrophe. Thinking of this, my heart is torn apart. How long has it been since the order of society has been peaceful and the people's panic has subsided? The evil communist bandits have once again invaded Changsha, killing our lives and burning our houses. Anyone with humanity would not be heartbroken. Alas, the red flame of the communist party is spreading, and our death is imminent. If we want to save ourselves, we can only kill this beast. If we want to save others, we must also eliminate the ugly class. The Association is holding this anti-communist propaganda at a serious time to make the people deeply aware of the importance of anti-communism and to have the same determination to eliminate the communists. We will have communists without me, and I will have no communists. We will work together to destroy this morning food, and then the communist party will be eliminated and the people will have hope for survival. It must be known that the Communist Party regards Soviet Russia as its motherland and China as its enemy. Their actions are not enough to satisfy their hearts and make them happy unless they ruin our country and exterminate our race. I hope that all the people of the province will save themselves and others and be determined to sweep away the evil atmosphere. I hope that all my compatriots across the country will save the country and protect the species and do their best to eliminate the communist party. The red beacon is in sight, and resentment fills our hearts. I am sad when I send this telegram remotely, hoping for your efforts. Sincerely, the Hunan People's Expanded Anti-Communist Propaganda Week Conference.)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Abolishes Sutra Chanting Tax in Various Counties</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government previously ordered the suspension of the Sutra Chanting Tax at the request of the Buddhist Association. The Provincial Committee decided to instruct the Finance and Education Departments to prepare a compensation plan before complying. Subsequently, the Buddhist Association submitted a request to suspend the collection of the Sutra Chanting Tax. If the compensation is awaited, it will be difficult to wait. The Provincial Government instructed the Finance and Education Departments to report the case together. The Finance and Education Departments then submitted a report to the Provincial Government, stating that the education fees in various counties of Jiangsu Province are mostly insufficient, and some have organized Sutra Chanting donations to provide assistance. If the collection is suddenly suspended, it will undoubtedly affect education. It is necessary to comply with the order to prepare compensation to maintain education. However, since the situation in each county is different, the compensation method is difficult to standardize. It is now proposed to instruct all counties that have already organized Sutra Chanting donations to immediately convene the Finance and Education Bureaus to properly discuss the compensation method and submit it for review and transfer. Those who have not collected it will not be allowed to organize it again. This method of handling will not conflict with the orders of the Ministry and will also maintain education funding. After receiving the report, the Provincial Government submitted it to yesterday's 332nd meeting for approval in accordance with the case and has already notified the Ministry of Interior.</p>
<h3>Yan Xishan Returns to Shijiazhuang from the Front</h3>
<p>Jin Army Prepares to Retreat and Preserve Strength</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Yan Xishan took a special train from Beiping to Tianjin on the morning of the 11th to inspect the Jinpu Railway, as detailed in the previous letter. It is now learned that Yan was chased by airplanes in the middle of the journey. After arriving in Dezhou at 1:30 PM, he transferred to a car and stayed temporarily in a small village. Zhang Yinwu, Wang Jingguo, and others rushed from the front to report that the defense was solid and asked Yan not to advance. Yan insisted on seeing the front line, so he took a car to the areas of Pingyuan, Huangheya, and Yucheng on the 12th. However, it was better not to look than to look. Since the defeat in Jinan, it has been almost a month, and the morale has been declining and the military discipline has been lax, without any rectification. Yan saw this weakness and said to Zhang Yinwu, Wang Jingguo, and others, "Defend if you can, retreat if you can't." On the morning of the 13th, he took a special train back to the north from Dezhou at 4:00 AM. At 8:05 AM, he passed Cangzhou and originally planned to transfer to a car to Shijiazhuang. However, the Cangshi Highway was washed away by mountain water. At 10:00 AM, he passed Chen Guancun, and at 11:00 AM, he arrived at the Tianjin Railway Station, which was even more heavily guarded than when he passed Tianjin on the 11th. At that time, it was the third train on the Beining Railway entering the station, and passengers changed from the underground passage to enter and exit. Yan's car was parked on the third track fork. Yuan Qingzeng, Cui Tingxian, Zeng Yanjie, and others boarded the car to pay their respects and talked for a long time. At 11:40 AM, Yuan and Zeng got off the car, and Yan left Cui Tingxian alone in another private room for a secret talk. At 11:55 AM, Cui finally got off the car. Liu Encheng, director of the Jinpu Bureau, also got off the car because his escort responsibility had been completed. Yan's special train had a total of twenty cars and no first- or second-class cars. A Jinpu Blue Steel third-class dining car was more prominent. Yan was sitting in the Pinghan Railway's 301st third-class sleeper car, which was equipped with a wireless telegraph machine. The rest were all iron-covered cars and dilapidated cars. At 12:05 AM, he left Tianjin, at 0:45 AM, he passed Yangcun, at 2:40 AM, he passed Anding, at 3:00 AM, he passed Huangcun, and at 3:30 AM, he passed Fengtai and transferred to the Pinghan Railway to Shijiazhuang. He will not return to Taiyuan and will go south to meet Feng Yuxiang to discuss new plans. Tianjin Mayor Cui Tingxian told reporters that the defeat on the Jinpu Railway was due to the failure of the Security Division. The so-called "pulling one hair moves the whole body." Jinan could not be defended, and the left and right wings had to retreat. It was rumored that Zhuan Zuoyi was responsible for the front, and because the pursuing troops were too urgent, he set fire to the Yellow River Railway Bridge. At that time, the Yellow River was flooded, and the railway bridge was burned. The retreating troops on the left and right wings were unable to retreat because there were too few ferries, and more than 30,000 people were captured. It is said that the loss of rifles was more than 2,000 machine guns, more than 300 mortars, more than 30 cannons, more than 500 cars, and more than 1,500 freight cars. Cui's words are indeed the real situation. The 16th Army stationed in the Tangshan, Kaiping, and Luanzhou areas was ordered to withdraw to Shijiazhuang, and a part of it has been mobilized. On the 12th, the army commander Yang Chengyuan rushed to Dezhou to ask Yan which army to fill the defense. Yan said, "You only need to withdraw, you don't need to ask which army will fill the defense." Yan's words are most noteworthy. Xie Lian, commander of the Jinpu Railway督战 (supervisory warfare) , led eight supervisory warfare teams from Yucheng by special train to the north on the morning of the 13th and passed Tianjin at 9:00 PM to Shijiazhuang. Based on these two points, it can be proved that there is no war to supervise on the Jinpu Railway, and preparations are being made to defend Jin Province as a base.</p>
<p>Recently, the local newspapers have gradually revealed the matter of the Northeast sending troops. The military authorities have not interfered. It is said that the Northeast sent troops to fill the defense of the Beining Railway due to the withdrawal of the 16th Army of the Jin faction. The Northeast's highest-ranking cadre conference has not yet been officially held because Tang Yulin, chairman of Rehe, has not arrived. Wan Fulin, Zhang Zuoxiang, Zhang Jinghui, Zou Zuohua, Zang Shiyi, Yu Xuezhong, and others who have arrived in Shenyang have exchanged opinions several times. In general, they all hope for peace in the current situation and oppose formally sending troops to participate in any aspect. At present, the opinions of representatives from all aspects in Shenyang are also very inconsistent. Both the north and the south hope that Zhang Xueliang will come out and say something fair so that the war can be resolved as soon as possible. Although Zhang has this intention, he has no such power, so armed mediation is absolutely impossible. If peaceful political methods are used to mediate, both public friendship with the south and private relations with the north must be taken into account, and a way must be found to start. This is an important issue worthy of research in the Northeast's highest-ranking cadre conference. Sun Chuanfang believes that it is more powerful for the Northeast to speak out after the two sides have fought several more battles and one side has reached a state of military exhaustion and financial exhaustion. This statement is also valued by senior Northeast generals and will be submitted to the formal meeting on the 15th for discussion. In addition to the rumors that Zhang Xueliang has ordered Zang Shiyi, Zou Zuohua, Yu Xuezhong, Ji Yiqiao, and other four divisions to prepare to enter the customs, reporters have inquired about all aspects and no one denies it. There are even those who say that the Northeast has internally decided that Zang Shiyi will be the chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, Zou Zuohua will be the commander of the Pingjin Garrison, Yu Xuezhong will be the commander of the Tianjin Garrison, and Ji Yiqiao will be the commander of the Beiping Garrison. These are all speculations and are too far from the facts.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>According to a person from the military agency, Yan Xishan knew that although Jinan had fallen, he did not know that the Jin army had failed to an irreparable point. On the 7th of this month, Yan went north from Shijiazhuang and wanted to see the Jinpu area. Zhang Yinwu heard the news and took a special train to Changxindian to dissuade him, falsely claiming that the front-line defense was solid and the morale was strong, and that enemy planes were coming to drop bombs from time to time. The總座 (general leader) did not need to risk going there. After Yan arrived in Beiping and took the chair, he was still not at ease with the military affairs in front, so he decided to go and see. After inspecting, he realized that the military future was hopeless, so he sternly ordered Zhang Yinwu and others to defend for three weeks and wait for instructions. There is still a glimmer of hope, which is to ask Feng Yuxiang to be solely responsible for the Pinghan and Longhai railways and to ask the Northeast Army to take over the defense of Hebei Province. If the Northeast Army does not come to take over the defense, then ask Zhang Xueliang to stand in the position of the people and advise Feng and Yan to step down and go abroad, and leave the national affairs to the people. Yan has arrived in Shijiazhuang and is about to go south to discuss this matter with Feng between Xinxiang and Zhangde. If Feng agrees, Yan will return to Ping and send another responsible representative out of the customs to explain to Zhang that Yan is willing to step down and go abroad and ask Zhang to come out to mediate. In short, within a month, the situation and military affairs will undergo a new transformation and open a new act. (September 14)</p>
<h3>Wuhu Express</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance issued short-term customs treasury bills, and Anhui Province was assigned to raise 1.5 million yuan. The Provincial Government has assigned the Wuhu City to raise 60,000 yuan and Wuhu County to raise 22,000 yuan, to be paid in two installments by mid-September and the end of September.</p>
<p>Recently, the small steamers from Wuhu to the inland have been repeatedly robbed. The Datong and Hefei routes have been robbed many times, causing huge losses. The General Chamber of Commerce has requested the Garrison Regiment to send troops to protect them based on the requests of various merchants. The regiment has sent troops to escort the steamers from today, and all small steamers in various places have resumed operations.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government previously discussed abolishing the Wuhu Municipal Preparatory Office, but this has been temporarily shelved and submitted to the Central Government for resolution. Therefore, the office is now working as usual. It is now scheduled to begin dismantling the North Gate tower and city walls tomorrow, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau has been notified to send police to take care of it. (17th)</p>

<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Suppression Commander Convenes Meeting: The four counties of Songjiang, Qingpu, Jinshan, and Pinghu, which border Jiangsu and Zhejiang, have been repeatedly harassed by bandits, causing great harm. Looting, arson, and murder are too terrible to witness. The military and police are tired of running around to suppress them, making it difficult to start. Local residents have flocked to the cities and towns, and the commercial activity in the countryside has plummeted. It is learned that Xiong Shihui, the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression for the three provinces, has specially appointed Hu Zhengji as the Bandit Suppression Commander for the four counties, responsible for supervising and suppressing them within a time limit. Yesterday, Commander Hu convened a bandit suppression meeting in Zhujing, with the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of the four counties, Chen Zekuan, district chief of the Jiangsu Water Police District, Xu Pucheng, district chief of the Zhejiang Water Police District, and others. Commander Hu presided over the meeting, and the county magistrate of this county, Jin, and the water police captain Fan Zicheng, and others personally attended. Each reported on the situation of bandit harassment in their jurisdiction, and then decided on the bandit suppression implementation methods before adjourning. It is heard that Pinghu County will propose that representatives from all walks of life in the four counties be jointly elected to form an organization to prepare for the commander's consultation on bandit suppression matters in order to avoid isolation. Personnel are currently being sent to various counties to solicit opinions so that they can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Court Leaders Scheduled to Take Oath: The County Court of this county has been established for more than a month, but the oath ceremony has not yet been held. The court has scheduled it to be held on the 20th, and invitations have been sent to various groups to attend the ceremony.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Appeal Judgment of Qiantai Cheng Robbery: Two robbers, Wei Zhihe and Guo Desheng, who were involved in the Qiantai Cheng robbery case outside Xumen, appealed to the High Court against the judgment of the local court. The High Court opened a hearing on the case the day before yesterday. Wei withdrew his appeal in court. As for 墎 Desheng, he was sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment by Judge Zheng of the Second Criminal Court yesterday (18th). A large group of bandit ships fled to Yishan Lake.

After obtaining the confession, County Magistrate Ruan immediately prepared a document and dispatched police to Lannidu to arrest Shen Keqin. According to him, he had a teacher-student relationship with the two female students. The confiscated publications had been reviewed and registered by the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Education, and contained no reactionary text.

After detailed inquiry, it was learned that on the 12th of this month, Pan Meiting, the captain of the Fourth Smuggling Suppression Brigade, led a team to Qianjiawei Nanshejiao Bridge to search for bandits.

Therefore, they went to the home of Chen Chuangen, a bandit, north of Liujiawan Bridge, and arrested both bandits Chen Chuangen and Dai Kechang (Dai was slightly injured in the battle between soldiers and bandits in Zhangliantang, so he was said to be hiding in Chen's home). Eight guns and ammunition were confiscated. They went to other places to search for bandits, but the bandits all fled. Wu A'zhao was shot dead on the spot as a warning. Chen Chuangen was briefly interrogated and confessed to having stolen weapons from the Qianjiawei Public Security Bureau without denial, and was then sent to the county for punishment.

Before leaving, the bandit leader told the family that they should prepare 3,000 yuan by tomorrow and come to a certain temple southwest of Langxia to redeem him. Although Zhang Desheng was considered well-off in the past, he has been robbed twice and is now impoverished, so he is afraid that he will not have money to redeem him.

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Circular Restricting Elementary School Song and Dance Performances</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has issued a circular to the education bureaus of all provinces and cities to restrict elementary school song and dance performances:</p>
<p>Recently, it has been found that elementary schools in various places often have song and dance performances. Preparations take a long time in advance, and teaching time almost occupies a large part of music and sports time. The time taken by a scene or a song at the event also takes up dozens of minutes. Children often sing and dance until they are sweating, gasping for breath, and hoarse. The purpose of this is to entertain guests at meetings and parent-teacher conferences, but there are also cases where private celebrations are held to gather entertainment for entertainment. According to the temporary standards for the elementary school curriculum issued by the Ministry, physical education and dance are limited to folk dances, etc., and music stipulates that simplified notation should not be used unless absolutely necessary. The dance in the song and dance drama is different from folk dances, etc., and teaching music with simplified notation is also inconsistent with the standard regulations. Moreover, singing and dancing use both sound and strength, and the time is long, which is more detrimental to children's physical education. As for using children as entertainment items to win personal favor, it is even more incompatible with the purpose of education. In short, this kind of song and dance drama has more harm than good, and should be restricted in a unified manner. Each school should not hold such performances more than twice a year. The materials taken should not be too long, and no long-term preparations should be made in advance, and no long-term performances should be made at the event. In addition to issuing separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the Ministry to pay close attention to and instruct its subordinates to comply with this order.</p>
<h3>Hunan Education Director Wei Protects Education</h3>
<p>Changsha was previously captured by the communist bandits, and all material construction was destroyed, and the loss of education was the greatest. Hunan Chairman He Yun has decided to allocate funds to open schools. However, the province's education fund and salt tax surcharge for education were borrowed due to the emergency of the communist suppression military affairs. Therefore, the funding is quite difficult. Huang Shiwei, the current director of the Hunan Education Bureau, is temporarily staying in Shanghai and has sent a letter to the Hunan Chairman, insisting that education funds cannot be used for other purposes, and those that have been borrowed must be returned by the Ministry of Finance so that schools can open on time. Otherwise, he will only resign to apologize to the education community. Here is a copy of the letter from Huang to He Yunqiao:</p>
<p>Chairman Yun Gong's seat, respectfully and solemnly, I returned to the province from Chenzhou a month ago and suffered from summer dampness. My mother was trapped in a dangerous city and suffered from the burning, killing, and terror, which caused fright. I had to come to Shanghai for medical treatment. I had to entrust Director Yu Ke to act on my behalf. Being away from the province for ten days, the affairs of Hunan are in an emergency. I am a member of the provincial committee and cannot follow you to share your worries. I feel extremely guilty. I have received letters from the education community stating that the government has borrowed the education fund stored in the bank, and has not received the monthly salt tax surcharge of tens of thousands of yuan. Education in Hunan will be suspended. If so, the hard-working teachers will lose their jobs, and the ambitious youth will lose their schooling. I think that to appease people's hearts, it is necessary to actively prepare for the opening of schools to make up for the deficiencies. When I left Hunan, I entrusted Director Zhang and Director Yu Ke to present it to you. Later, I received a letter from the Education Bureau informing me that our government accepted my opinion and decided to open schools on October 1. I am very happy with this approach. However, the fund has been withdrawn, the salt surcharge has not been resolved, and there is still no funding. It is still difficult to determine when the schools will open. I sincerely hope that you will maintain your enthusiasm for protecting education from beginning to end, and order the Ministry of Finance to return the borrowed education funds to the bank in installments, so as to avoid the name of borrowing educational funds. At the same time, please negotiate with Special Envoy Li to allocate the old amount of eight jiao per bag of salt tax surcharge to the management committee for responsible custody and distribution. On one hand, order the Ministry of Finance to issue funds as soon as possible to prepare for the opening of schools, and check the established cases and subsidize the insufficient expenses on a monthly basis so that education will not be interrupted. In this way, the war will be quelled and the music will not stop. This is also what you would like to do. Otherwise, empty promises will be difficult to fulfill. After thinking about it, I have no choice but to resign and retreat to make way for the capable. I humbly ask for your attention and instructions. I respectfully wish you peace and prosperity. I am very grateful. Huang Shiheng bows to you on September 16.</p>

<p>The first Jiangnan University Sports Association swimming championship will be held at Jiaotong University tomorrow (Saturday) starting at 1:00 PM. Details were reported in this newspaper yesterday. The registration deadline was the 17th, and a total of 35 swimmers from Jiaotong, Jinan, Guanghua, and Daxia universities are participating. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) List of Officials</p>

<p>The Jiaotong University swimming pool was drained a few days ago and is currently being cleaned by workers. There is not much space for spectators, so tickets will be sold for 40 cents each to limit the number of spectators.</p>
<p>Judging by the number of participants, Jiaotong and Jinan have the most, followed by Daxia, and then Guanghua and Chizhi. Because Jiaotong has the convenience of a swimming pool and more opportunities for practice, their results should be better than other schools. However, many of the Jinan swimmers are from Nanyang and are proficient in this sport. It is expected that the championship will be contested between Jiaotong and Jinan. Due to their smaller numbers, Daxia, Guanghua, and Chizhi may find it difficult to compete.</p>

<h3>Yu Binqi Initiates Table Tennis Referee Association</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Table Tennis Federation in Shanghai in 1918, table tennis has become popular throughout the country. However, the rules have not been uniformly standardized. A survey of inland areas such as Zhejiang, Shaoxing, Xiaoshan, Jiangsu, Kunshan, and Taicang reveals that the rules are still similar to tennis. Senior sports figures fear that those familiar with this sport are few, resulting in a lack of qualified referees. Fortunately, in the spring of 1927, Japan sent representatives such as Kushima and Kido to Shanghai to organize international table tennis rules with Chinese representatives Lin Zecang, Hu Tiewu, Yu Binqi, Jin Jiming, He Yiyun, and foreign representatives such as Englishman Hawkins and American Egglai. The rules have been used in the Far East Games and have been well received. However, although the rules have been in effect for several years, a referee association has yet to be organized. Taking advantage of the current Champagne Cup competition, which is attracting many talented players and is fiercely competitive, Yu Binqi is organizing such an association. All table tennis enthusiasts who are keen to participate and jointly study and who wish to become referees can register in person within two days at the Racecourse Club, 323 De Fu Li, Mahuo Road. The rules will be given away for free.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Convened Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Important Financial Matters</h3>
<p>New Tariff to be Announced on Schedule</p>
<p>Since his return to Shanghai from Jinan, Finance Minister Song Ziwen has stayed in Shanghai for several days to handle official business. Yesterday afternoon, he convened a meeting at the Minister's Office of the Central Bank, gathering the heads of various departments and the responsible personnel of various financial institutions in Shanghai to discuss the abolition of likin taxes, revenue collection, and other important financial issues. Because it was an internal administrative meeting, security was tight, and the contents of the meeting could not be ascertained. However, it is heard that the new national tariff is scheduled to be announced on the original date (October 10). As for the abolition of likin taxes, it is difficult to implement due to the unsettled military situation in various places, so it is proposed to postpone implementation. Although there is a link between the new tariff and the abolition of likin taxes, it is said that they will be implemented separately according to their urgency and priority.</p>

<p>Chairman's Remarks: Temporary Chairman Tang briefly stated that today is the inaugural meeting and first meeting of the committee, and he is grateful for the attendance of all committee members. The necessity of establishing this committee is due to the fact that the Municipal Government has a construction discussion committee, but it cannot specialize in financial matters, hence the decision to form this committee. Municipal finance has always been open. Now, the Finance Bureau, to promote openness, is publishing a quarterly to allow citizens to understand finance, which can also serve as a reference for policymakers. Naikang especially wants to thoroughly improve the system and respects everyone as economic and financial experts or local elders of Shanghai, and specially invited them to serve as committee members so that policy implementation will not be isolated and can be easily carried out. Proper financial reorganization requires collective thinking and effort. He hopes for guidance on all matters in the future. The constitution and rules of the committee have already been drafted. He requests everyone present to discuss them, elect a chairman, and hold the first meeting. He hopes everyone will express their insightful opinions. Li Quanshi, Wang Yansong, and Ye Huijun then delivered speeches successively, followed by a response from Director Tang.</p>
<p>Election of Chairman: After the speeches, the election of the chairman began. Wang Xiaolai was elected as the Chairman, and Xu Jiqing and Zhu Dazhai were elected as the Vice-Chairmen.</p>
<p>First Meeting Agenda: (1) Chairman respectfully reads the Prime Minister's will; (2) Report on matters; (3) Discussion matters; (4) Bylaws of the committee; (5) Committee members identify matters for group review and nominate group leaders.</p>
<p>First Meeting: The elected Chairman immediately held the first meeting. Chairman Wang Xiaolai respectfully read the will. The Chairman first reported the significance of the establishment of the assembly, stating that it had been reported by Director Tang and would not be repeated. Then, the by-laws were discussed and it was decided to submit it to the Finance and Administration Group for review. (2) Committee members identify matters for group review and nominate group leaders.</p>
<p>Committee Members of Each Group: It was decided that the Finance and Administration Group would have five members: Xu Fu, Shen Lianfang, Hu Mengjia, Shen Tianxin, Yu Hongjun, with Shen Lianfang as the director. (2) The Economics Group would have four members: Qin Run卿, Xu Peikun, Wang Yansong, Li Fuxun, with Qin Run卿 as the director.

<h3>Opposition to Water Rate Increase</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Will Reconsider</p>
<p>Meeting: According to the Ta Mei Wan Pao (Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury), the Public Works Department of the Public Concession held a routine board meeting yesterday (17th) afternoon, as various Chinese groups have been opposing the water rate increase. They discussed whether the resolution on this matter could be reconsidered. However, according to a senior official of the department, the discussion only concerned the possibility of submitting it for reconsideration at the next meeting, and the resolution itself was not discussed. Furthermore, today (18th), the Chairman of the Public Works Department, Fessenden, met with officials from the Water Company for a long time to discuss the water price increase issue, but the content remains confidential.</p>
<p>Reply: The Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, McKnoton, replied yesterday to a letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Association, translated as follows: In response to the five points raised in your letter of September 12th, the answers are as follows: 1. The amount of the net profit loss this year depends on how the exchange rate changes, and especially on the exchange rate when dividends are paid out next March. Assuming the exchange rate is one shilling and six pence, the statutory dividends to be paid will be approximately 646,242 taels of silver. The surcharge can make up for this loss, approximately 215,000 taels of silver. 2. The reserve fund under (average dividend) is approximately 380,000 taels of silver. This reserve fund, together with the increased surcharge, will be used to make up for the aforementioned loss. It is estimated that there will still be a shortfall of 51,242 taels of silver. 3. If the exchange rate is one shilling and seven pence and a quarter when dividends are paid, then approximately 55,225 taels, 3 dimes, and 4 mils of silver can be saved on the dividend payment. 4. According to the contract stipulated in 1928, the various stocks must be paid interest annually as stipulated by law. If the net profit this year is insufficient to pay interest, it will be supplemented from the net profit of the following year. 5. The contract stipulated in 1928 states that the water price will be revised every five years after the revision on July 1, 1929. It can be revised at any time with the consent of both parties. The current rate period lasts until June 30, 1931. It has now been agreed to extend the period to the end of next year. It is proposed to request the Public Works Department to investigate the accounts of the Water Company. This article has been implemented every six months since the 1928 contract was signed. As for this price increase, the Public Works Department will reconsider it in the coming days. We will inform you of the decision in another letter. Finally, one last word: the public utilities mentioned in your letter must be owned by the city, and public interests should be prioritized, which is reasonable. However, this issue is of great concern, and the opinions of experts are difficult to reconcile. It seems that a detailed discussion cannot be made in this limited space. We hereby reply for your information.</p>
<p>Recognition and Efforts to Commemorate Mr. Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom</p>
<p>1. On September 21st of the ninth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Zhu Zhixin, unfortunately, after risking entering Guangdong to contact Guangdong military leaders to counter the counter-revolutionary Guangxi warlord Mo Rongxin, was killed by Guangxi rebels after occupying the Humen Fort. This tragic day is a day of commemoration.</p>

<h3>Again Requesting a Ban on the Import of Japanese Silkworm Cocoons</h3>
<p>The issue of Japanese silkworm cocoons being shipped to China has already aroused the reaction of Chinese people and silk cocoon merchants across the country. Recently, the customs has ordered a ban on the import of Japanese silkworm cocoons. Yesterday, the Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter and telegram to the General Association of Silk Cocoons of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting them to find ways to stop it. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter to the General Association of Silk Cocoons: Respectfully, our association received a telegram from the Jiaxing Silk Cocoon Association stating that the import of Japanese dry cocoons will lead to the demise of the Chinese silk cocoon industry, which is of great importance to national taxes and commerce. The telegram requests a swift method of resistance, which is a common feeling. We believe that the import of foreign raw materials is a good sign of the progress of our country's industry, and free international trade is not something we should reject or accept. What is strange is that your association holds the key to the silk cocoons of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Now that the Japanese are increasingly ambitious to seize Chinese silk, your association did not find a way to resist it, but because of this year's poor silkworm cocoon harvest, fearing that the silk factories in Shanghai would not have enough supply, it initiated the purchase of Japanese cocoons and requested a reduction in import taxes to reduce the cost of shipping to China so that silk factories could purchase them. Your association's plan for the silk factories is indeed good, but because our country's silkworm breeding methods mostly adhere to old habits and have not been fully improved, the quality of the cocoons and silk reeling are difficult to compete with Japanese cocoons. If Japanese cocoons continue to be shipped in according to established cases, not only will the silkworm factories in the inland areas face failure, but also the Chinese cocoons will be infringed upon by Japanese cocoons, and the beauty and profit of silkworm farming will decline. This is tantamount to fueling the Japanese desire to seize Chinese silk. It is nominally to help silk factories in Shanghai, but it is no different from driving the silk cocoons of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to the brink of extinction. It is found that a large number of inland silk cocoons have been transported to Shanghai and stored in warehouses awaiting sale this year. The reason why silk factories have recently stopped working is due to the sluggish sales of foreign silk and the accumulation of inventory. It is not due to a lack of raw materials. To seek the future development of Chinese silk and the current relief, the fundamental solution is to reduce the export tax on raw silk and various surcharges on dry cocoons. The symptomatic solution is to temporarily exempt all taxes and fees related to Chinese silk, add a period and limit on the amount, so that tax revenue and commerce are not hindered. If your association can unite the power of silk cocoon merchants from the three provinces to achieve the goal of exemption or reduction, the accumulated difficulties of silk cocoons may have a day of recovery. If you only plead for Japanese merchants, your plan will be unwise. No wonder the silkworm industry in the inland areas has complained. Our association has already submitted the previous opinions to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for adoption. If your association agrees, we hope that you will advocate for it together.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Respectfully, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government, according to a telegram from the Jiaxing Silk Cocoon Association stating that the import of Japanese dry cocoons will lead to the demise of the Chinese silk cocoon industry, which is of great importance to national taxes and commerce. The telegram requests a swift method of resistance, which is a common feeling. It was submitted to the board of directors meeting on September 13 for discussion. Everyone agreed that the import of foreign raw materials is indeed a good sign for our country's industry, but the import of raw materials as Japanese dry cocoons is of great importance to the future of our country's silkworm industry. If Japanese cocoons continue to come in, not only will the silkworm factories in the inland areas fail, but also because our country's silkworm breeding methods have not been fully improved, they may decline due to the infringement of Japanese cocoons. The General Association of Silk Cocoons of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces holds the key to the silk cocoons of the three provinces. Because of this year's poor harvest, fearing that the silk factories in Shanghai would not have enough supply, they purchased Japanese cocoons and requested a reduction in import taxes, which is tantamount to fueling the Japanese desire to seize Chinese silk. It is nominally to help silk factories in Shanghai, but it is no different from driving the silk cocoons of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to the brink of extinction. It is found that there are still quite a few leftover cocoons from inland areas transported to Shanghai and stored in warehouses awaiting sale this year. The reason why silk factories have recently stopped working is due to the sluggish sales of foreign silk and the accumulation of inventory. It is not due to a lack of raw materials. Our association advocates that to seek the future development of Chinese silk and the current relief, the fundamental solution is to reduce the export tax on raw silk and various surcharges on dry cocoons. The symptomatic solution is to temporarily exempt all taxes and fees, but restrictions on the period and amount must be added to avoid hindering tax revenue. Our association believes that silk cocoons are our country's inherent beauty, which is related to national tax revenue and people's livelihoods. We sincerely ask the ministry to review and adopt our views, and to cancel the reduction of import taxes on Japanese cocoons in order to comply with the situation. Our association is very grateful, and the nation is grateful. The Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Navigation Administration Bureau Expands Inland River Shipping</h3>
<p>The Navigation Administration Bureau of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province has leased all of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's inland river ships to develop Zhejiang's shipping industry, which has been reported in this newspaper. Recently, General Manager Chen Shuntong, Associate Manager Sheng Nian, Shanghai Manager Zhang Shusheng, and others have agreed on further expansion measures. The latest news is divided as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Up Upstream Routes: The upper reaches of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang, such as Yuhang, Fuyang, Jinhua, Jianxi, etc., are prosperous areas for Zhejiang's trade, but there are no scheduled ships, which hinders the development of transportation and commerce. The bureau, under the main purpose of the Construction Department, is planning to add upstream ships. General Manager Chen Shuntong and Zhang Shusheng have decided to divide the upper reaches of the Qiantang River into six routes. It is planned to open two or three routes first so that passengers and goods from Yuhang and other places can be connected to Shanghai. Chen Shuntong went to Hangzhou yesterday to discuss the implementation plan with the Construction Department.</p>
<p>Assigning Existing Routes: After the bureau took over, it has now allocated and operated all routes. They are specifically listed as follows: (1) Shanghai-Hangzhou route: Hengren and Lixiang ships. (2) Shanghai-Huzhou route: Hengji and Liyuan ships. (3) Shanghai-Suzhou route: He'an and Gonglong ships. (4) Suzhou-Hangzhou route: Lihang, Lichuan, and Hengsheng ships. (5) Zhenjiang route: Junfa, Hengtong, and Hekuan ships. (6) Xicheng route: Taichang and Yuren ships. (7) Xili route: Jianyuan ship. (8) Jiahu route: Dehe ship. (9) Changli route: Jianyuan ship. (10) Changqing route: Ruishun ship. (11) Sudang route: Xiangfu ship. (12) Xunjia route: Feilong ship. (13) Puchang route: Feima ship. In addition, Yonggu is assigned to Yangxiang, Xin'an is assigned to Pingxia, Junfeng is sailing to Dutou Xueli is sailing to Xiashi, and Hongan is rented out. Hengfeng is under repair.</p>
<p>Eliminating Bad Habits in Various Ports: The bureau adopts the principle of integrity and focuses on facilitating merchants in the water transport fees of various ports. It breaks all bad habits such as rebates and strictly orders branch bureaus in various ports to collect ship tickets at fixed prices, eliminating the long-standing evil of foreign water peeling. For example, violations will be severely punished. The practice of adding water to ticket sales is the worst long-standing habit of inland river ships, which is difficult to break. Now the bureau has strictly eliminated this malpractice, so that travelers can avoid the pain of unexpected losses. Shanghai Bureau Director Zhang Shusheng is especially strict and upright in handling affairs. No matter how busy the incoming and outgoing documents are, they are not allowed to be delayed for a moment and must be handled on the same day. Therefore, the bureau is full of vitality and the future is very optimistic. The total annual business of the bureau is 400,000 yuan. After the opening of the new route in Zhejiang and the completion of intermodal transport, it is expected to increase revenue.</p>
<h3>Li Zhonggong Sends a Telegram to the Whole Country to Jointly Save China's Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Li Zhonggong, the general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sent a telegram to the whole country yesterday, stating that: to the party headquarters of various provinces and cities, the governments of various provinces and cities, the chambers of commerce, labor unions, and farmers' associations of various provinces and cities, and various newspapers: Zhonggong is entrusted with foolishness and stupidity by the National Government to manage the affairs of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He cannot refuse to resign and has taken office on the first day of this month. He believes that the rise and fall of the shipping industry is related to the country's economy, transportation, and national defense. The Prime Minister's will shows that food, clothing, housing, and transportation are all necessary for people's livelihood. However, our country's inland river shipping rights have been seized by unequal treaties, and the domestic shipping industry has long been in an oppressed position, so that the only remaining fruit of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, despite its 50-year history, has not only made little progress, but has also been declining and weakening. Accumulated malpractices and dangers are even more pressing at present. He believes that his mediocre talent is difficult to handle this situation, and he hopes that the times will provide guidance and assistance. Public and private exchanges have no end. He respectfully sends a telegram to announce his sincerity and awaits guidance. Acting on behalf of the special commissioner for the reorganization of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, General Manager Li Zhonggong kowtows.</p>
<h3>Li Zhonggong Paid a Visit to the French Consul General Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Zhonggong, Vice Minister of Transportation and General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, telegraphed Liu Yunfang, the Deputy Director of the Diplomatic Affairs Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, yesterday morning to arrange a time to formally visit the French Consul General in Shanghai. Liu stated that French Consul General Ganquilin had gone to Japan and not returned. He arranged for Li to meet with Ke Fude, the French Vice Consul who was acting as Consul General, at 4:00 PM. At that time, General Manager Li, accompanied by Director Liu, went to the French Consulate on Gongguan Road to meet with Consul Ke. Li expressed his deep gratitude to Consul Ke for the French Consul General's friendly spirit and mediation in the Jin Liyuan Wharf case, and hoped that they would continue to cooperate in the spirit of friendship between China and France in the future. Consul Ke stated that he would not only continue the spirit of friendly cooperation, but also hoped that this spirit would progress with each day. Li immediately expressed his gratitude and left.</p>
<h3>Guangji Ship Released and Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two Compradors Released and Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Ships Operate on Regular Schedule</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangji ship was detained in Wenzhou because the crew member Liu Fulai was an escapee. Yesterday, the ship had returned to Shanghai. According to the crew, when the Guangji arrived in Wenzhou, the 19th Army learned that the watchman Liu Fulai was a member of the Communist Party, so they sent more than 70 soldiers to the ship to arrest Liu. Liu had gone ashore after the ship arrived at the dock, so the soldiers came and Liu had left the ship. The soldiers searched the ship for a long time. Because they did not find Liu Fulai, they detained the two compradors, Wang Shoukang, to the headquarters. They learned that the crew was completely unaware of Liu's joining the party and had no relationship with colleagues in the bureau. Therefore, they ordered the Guangji crew to provide a guarantee and released Wang Shoukang. Wang was detained at the headquarters of the 19th Army for a day and returned to Shanghai on the original Guangji ship yesterday. According to the Communist Party roster seized by the 19th Army, Liu Fulai was responsible for transmitting the party's messages and correspondence between Shanghai and Wenzhou, and his responsibilities were very important. Once he is caught, he will be able to extract information about the Communist Party's organizations and actions in Shanghai and other places. The 19th Army believed that this matter had nothing to do with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Guangji ship, so they did not delay and released the ship, ordering it to unload cargo as usual, so it was not delayed. It has now returned to Shanghai. Liu is still at large in Wenzhou and is now under strict arrest.</p>
<h3>Continued Records of Yangtze River Navigation Security</h3>
<p>Xinghe Japanese Ship Attacked: Recently, there have been frequent incidents of bandits in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River harming merchants and travelers. Foreign merchant ships have already dispatched soldiers to protect them. This time, the Japanese Qinglun Daxiangmaru was shot at by bandits at Xinghekou. Four shots were fired, one of which hit the bow of the ship, and one sailor was wounded by the bullet. The bandits retreated after the navy on the ship fired machine guns.</p>
<h3>Provincial Reorganization Committee Order Abolishing the Land Rent Arbitration Regulations and Amending Article 15 of the Rent Payment Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee received Order No. 1009 from the Provincial Reorganization Committee yesterday, stating that: The letter from the Jiangsu Provincial Government approves the petition from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to abolish the province's Provisional Land Rent Arbitration Regulations and amend Article 15 of the Provisional Rent Payment Regulations. After reviewing the situation, the Central Political Council Secretariat transferred it to the Central Political Council for review and approval.

It was approved at the 308th meeting of the committee, and the case was recorded and reported, and separate orders were issued.

The situation is unbearable to witness. In the blink of an eye, the weather is getting colder and the suffering is even worse. People from all walks of life here are trying to raise funds for relief and have telegraphed various places requesting donations. Shanghai has always been enthusiastic about disaster relief in various places, actively donating and taking the lead. The country admires its benevolence and righteousness. In this case, the floods in western Liaoning will surely be the same. Brother sees and hears clearly and cannot sleep peacefully. He calls for help from afar and awaits rescue, which is his duty to speak out for the people. He especially telegraphed my brother and the leaders of various sectors in Shanghai to jointly initiate fundraising, or to establish a fundraising committee, or to organize a fundraising entertainment event, so as to collect as much as possible and work together to save these victims. Brother's hunger and thirst for the sick is in his arms, and when he calls, all mountains will respond. He hopes to promote vigorously and actively carry out the benevolent heart of the people and things, and to save the disaster and help the neighboring righteousness. The merits will be covered, and the whole life will be saved. He is in a critical situation and awaits rescue. He respectfully asks for the help of the people of western Liaoning. Except for telegrahing the leaders of various sectors in Shanghai to investigate and liaise, and entrusting Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Municipal Government to represent and convene a meeting to proceed on a specific date, he respectfully expresses his sincerity.

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Progress of the Cotton Fabric Exhibition</h3>

The letter stated: "Our hall held a domestic silk exhibition in May of this year, collecting silk products from various provinces and cities for display in different sections, which achieved considerable scale and attracted attention from people in society. Furthermore, cotton fabrics are essential for the daily use of the public, with a wider market and lower prices. In order to advocate thrift and frugality, we urgently need to continue holding cotton fabric exhibitions to encourage guidance and promote observation. We have already drafted the articles of association and rules for collecting exhibits, which have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval. The opening is scheduled for October 10th. This undertaking is of great importance to the future of the cotton fabric industry, and all preparations rely on the joint assistance of the cotton industry. In addition to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce specifically consulting with the governments of various provinces and cities to jointly solicit exhibits and appointing a preparatory committee, we have long admired your association's advocacy of national products and its enthusiasm. We dare to ask you to serve as the resident Shanghai collection point. The Shanghai office of our hall's cotton fabric exhibition will be attached to your association for convenience. We hereby inform you accordingly, hoping for your approval. Our curator is scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 19th of this month. Please make preparations in advance. The preparatory committee is also planning to convene at your location," and so on.</p>
<h3>Japanese Officials Return to Shanghai After Completing Inspection</h3>

He is expected to go to Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places for inspection within days.</p>
<h3>Cotton Crop Failure in Various Zhai Towns West of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ninth District, Fourteenth Precinct Submits Request for Tax Reduction</p>
<p>Seventy to eighty percent of the farmers in the various Zhai towns west of Shanghai rely on cotton planting for their livelihood. Since the beginning of summer this year, the rainfall has been irregular, and the cotton harvest is only about ten catties per mu. The farmers throughout the towns are worried and gloomy because they have no hope for the autumn harvest. The Fourteenth Precinct of the Ninth District of the city has submitted a report on the drought in the towns to higher authorities, requesting that it be forwarded to the municipal government to reduce or exempt taxes. The original report is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted by the undersigned precinct, since the beginning of summer in the Zhai towns, the rainfall has been irregular, and the temperature has been uneven. As a result, the cotton in the fields has flowered but not fruited, and the yield per mu is mostly only a dozen catties. It is estimated that the value per mu is only a little over one yuan. In the worst cases, this amount is not enough to provide warmth and food for a family of several people. Those in the villages who plant cotton account for seventy to eighty percent of the population. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and a local famine has already occurred. It is foreseeable that people's livelihoods will be difficult in the future. Therefore, we are especially listing the grievances and earnestly requesting that you forward them to the superior party department and consult with the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiading and Qingpu County Governments to quickly dispatch special commissioners to the countryside to investigate the disaster-stricken areas and grant them tax reductions and exemptions, thereby prioritizing the people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Products to Be Inspected</h3>
<p>Procedures for Customs Declaration of Exports and Transshipments</p>
<p>Registration to Begin with Grains and Rice, Followed by Wheat and Flour</p>
<p>The Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Institute recently submitted a report to the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, requesting that it be forwarded to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to issue a notice to the customs to assist and allocate funds for implementation. It also proposed to start with grain and rice inspection and registration. The original report stated that all those who trade, import, export, and transship food should first report to the local inspection and registration authorities for inspection and registration. Only after the stamp of the seal is affixed can customs be declared. In fact, unless this is done, grain merchants cannot be made to comply uniformly. However, if this method is implemented without the assistance of the customs, it is feared that unscrupulous merchants will regard it as a mere formality and evade smuggling, and the inspection authorities will not be able to impose sanctions, resulting in omissions. This would defeat the central government's plan to statistically analyze food and regulate people's food supply. This kind of problem is not unique to Shanghai; it is also difficult to avoid at ports in various places. Therefore, when the institute starts, it will notify all grain merchants to comply. In addition, it is proposed that your ministry forward the report to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to notify the customs to assist. In the future, when encountering customs declarations for importing, exporting, and transshipping food, customs officials should order the merchants to first send the customs declaration, bill of lading, permit, and other related documents to the food inspection and registration authorities in the respective areas to affix the seal before allowing customs declaration and release to prevent smuggling. Furthermore, the institute previously requested the addition of a special class for inspection and registration of food and the compilation of a minimum budget for temporary and recurring expenses for the class, which was sent to your ministry to be forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval to add the special class and to instruct the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. Now that the class has been prepared, the implementation of inspection and registration is imminent. Please quickly present the matter to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to reallocate the funds urgently. Furthermore, Article 4 of the regulations stipulates that food inspection and registration should be implemented in stages according to procedures. The intention is that the needs of the people's food supply should vary from place to place. Rice is the main staple in the south, and the institute should start with rice protection. Once the scale is gradually established, wheat flour and other foods can be added in order. The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining has submitted a report to the Executive Yuan, and the Executive Yuan has ordered the Ministry of Finance to instruct the customs to assist in the inspection and registration matters. The addition of a special class and budget has also been approved by the Executive Yuan. The registration of grains and rice first has also been ordered and approved by the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>

<h3>Lawyers Association Joint Meeting of Directors and Supervisors</h3>
<p>Sixty-Third Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened its sixty-third joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 6 p.m. yesterday. Chairman Liu Zuwang conducted the meeting with customary greetings and presented the following proposals:</p>
<p>(1) A case in which the Jiangsu High Court requested the second reissuance of lawyer certificates with attached photos has been completed, and the certificates are enclosed for distribution. It was resolved that the certificates would be distributed to the members for collection at the members' general meeting on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>(2) Committee member Yu Jingluo proposed that the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's announcement, issued by order of the Municipal Government, to strictly crack down on rent arrears, raises doubts about the infringement of judicial power. An emergency discussion was held on a plan to protest and prevent this. (The full text is recorded below.) The committee members considered this matter to be important and resolved to send a letter to the Municipal Government inquiring about the specific methods and boundaries of cracking down on rent arrears and whether it involves judicial power. At the same time, they will submit a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration to instruct the courts to vigorously implement provisional execution and other preservation measures for rent arrears cases and to pay attention to the Police Bureau's announcement to prevent the infringement of judicial power.</p>
<p>(3) Applications for membership from lawyers Xu Xiangshu and Wang Jing and others were approved.</p>
<p>(4) A letter from member Li Shirui regarding the extension of a loan was resolved to be answered, requesting that it be repaid by the end of this year.</p>
<p>(5) Member Shen Xiaoxiang proposed that the autumn general meeting should elect a presidium of twelve or fifteen people. It was resolved that, according to Article 18 of the association's rules, this case is not established, and a letter of response should be sent to the original proposer for their information.</p>
<p>(6) The presidium for this year's autumn general meeting should be determined quickly. It was resolved to elect committee members Liu Zuwang, Jiang Yiping, and Tan Yigong as the presidium.</p>
<p>(7) Member Shen Xiaoxiang proposed that the judicial and legislative branches should abolish the old practice of "father's debts are inherited by the son." It was resolved to answer the case with a letter.</p>
<p>The proposal of committee member Yu Jingluo is recorded below:</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal, on the 14th of this month, newspapers reported a notice from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau (政字第25號) regarding the crackdown on rent arrears, stating that "this matter of rent arrears has recently been ordered by the Municipal Government to be cracked down on, and it should be handled conscientiously in accordance with one's duties. If any cases of arbitrary rent arrears are found in the future, the landlords should report them immediately, and they will be strictly cracked down on without any leniency. It is hoped that all residents in the area will comply." The specific methods of "strict crackdown" are not explicitly stated, but it can be inferred that they would include urging payment, summoning for questioning, detention, or sealing and eviction. All of these measures are the inherent functions of the court and should not be usurped by the Police Bureau. The Police Bureau's announcement states that it was ordered by the Municipal Government to crack down on rent arrears, but it is not known what legal basis there is for this. It is true that landlords in Shanghai suffer from the pain of rent arrears, but there is no absolute lack of remedies in litigation law. If the judicial authorities vigorously implement provisional execution and other preservation procedures, it would be sufficient to reduce delays and prevent escapes. To entrust the power of cracking down to the police for arbitrary disposition is to seek convenience for a small number of landlords at the expense of the entire judicial power, exposing our shortcomings to foreign observers in Shanghai. The impact of this cannot be overstated. The association seems unable to remain silent on this important issue. Therefore, it is proposed that an emergency meeting should be convened to discuss a concrete plan to protest and prevent this in order to maintain legal rights.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Disaster Relief Association Sends Telegram to National Government</h3>
<p>Requesting Telegram Ordering Chief Commander He to Thoroughly Investigate the Truth of the Hunan Incident</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai sent an important telegram yesterday, which read: "Respectfully addressed to the Nanjing National Government and the Executive Yuan, since the bandit communists in Hunan Province were suppressed by Chief Commander He under orders, the situation in the province has turned from danger to safety, and the people have been able to catch their breath. However, in this recent disaster, Changsha, the capital of the province, has fallen again, and the losses of the people are incalculable. The responsible authorities of the provincial government had no defense plan in advance, and afterwards, they shirked responsibility. They have failed the central government and the people of Hunan. We request that your government and your yuan send a telegram ordering Chief Commander He to thoroughly investigate the truth on the spot, to punish them as an example, so that the officials can be rectified and the people can express their grievances. We await your orders with anticipation. Respectfully, the Shanghai Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai."</p>

<h3>British American Tobacco Company Comprador Cai Fulin Kidnapped</h3>
<p>Gangster Car Waiting to the Left of the Door</p>
<p>Kidnapped While Seeing Off a Guest</p>
<p>Cai Fulin, also known as Cai Boliang, a local resident aged forty-six, a comprador of the British American Tobacco Company, residing at 56A Hart Road, was kidnapped by gangsters around 8:05 p.m. last night while seeing off a guest. The guest took his car and left, and Cai was kidnapped just before entering the door. The license plate number of the gangster car was 3308. After kidnapping Cai Fulin, they headed west on Connaught Road and disappeared in an instant. The matter was immediately reported to the Gordon Road Police Station by the victim's family, requesting an arrest. Cai had a car of his own, number 1747, which was the one used to see off the guest. It is heard that Cai's family is very poor, or it may be a case of mistaken kidnapping.</p>
<h3>Seventy-Year-Old Man Abducts Girl</h3>
<p>Li Decheng Deceives Blind Woman</p>
<p>Jin Xiaozan Rescues Tu'er</p>
<p>Wu Xiufeng, a detective from the Municipal Police Bureau, was returning home from the team around 3 p.m. yesterday when he suddenly caught sight of an old man with a girl in a hurried manner while passing Keming Road. Upon closer inspection, the detective remembered that the old man had committed an abduction case in the Fifth District before, so he followed him. He saw the old man leading the girl to the door of 18 Shunda Lane and knocking on the door urgently, but no one answered. The old man then went to the back door. When he turned around, he noticed Detective Wu nearby and knew that something was wrong, so he abandoned the child and tried to escape, but was intercepted and brought back to the team with the girl. After a detailed interrogation by Captain Lu, the old man confessed his name as Li Decheng, aged seventy, from Qingjiang, currently living at 9 Xin Kaihe. He admitted to the abduction and confessed that he had seen a blind woman with a girl on a Jiangbei boat near Nanxing Bridge in Suzhou the previous month. He then had the intention to abduct the girl, so he spent time with the blind woman every day. The woman said that she was living in desperation and was about to starve to death, so I (the robber Li claimed) sent her a liter of rice and at the same time used a method to abduct the child. On the morning of July 21st of the lunar calendar, he took a car to Shanghai and sold her to the Chen Wei family in Shunda Lane for a price of eighty yuan. The Chen family only agreed to seventy yuan, so the deal was not settled. In total, he had sold three children to the Chen family, two of whom had already been resold. There was still one child that had not been sold. The abducted girl, named Jin Xiaozan, aged fourteen, from Funing, said that her mother had ordered her to go ashore to buy groceries when the boat docked at Nanxing Bridge in Suzhou around 8 p.m. the night before. She met the old man on Tanglu, who kept waving at her. She was unknowingly hypnotized and followed him to the station and took a car to Shanghai. Captain Lu obtained the confession and dispatched detectives Wu Zuorong and Yan Zhuming along with Detective Wu to Shunda Lane, where they arrested Chen Wei and rescued the abducted girl Tu'er. After interrogating the woman at the team, she confessed that she was fifty-two years old, from Fujian. The child Tu'er was sold to her by Li a few days ago for a price of 150 yuan. Her other statements were evasive. Captain Lu prepared a document based on the confession and sent the abductor Li Decheng and the child to the judicial section for processing. The woman Chen Wei was temporarily released on bail by her fellow villagers.</p>
<h3>Scheme to Get Rich Quick Fooled</h3>
<p>Two Gold Ingots Thrown into the Huangpu River</p>
<p>Where Did the Thousand Yuan in Banknotes Go?</p>
<p>No News of 200,000 in Unexpected Wealth</p>
<p>Such Things Actually Happen in the World</p>
<p>A certain person, A, who lives in Dongjiadu, South City, is a broker for a foreign company in the Public Concession. He goes out early and returns late, and he must pass through Xiaodongmen. One day in early this month, in the evening, A was returning home from work when a fortune teller, B, who had set up a stall inside a hotel in Xiaodongmen, suddenly shouted to A: "Sir, your luck is coming! You can get 200,000 in unexpected wealth within a few days!" A was temporarily bewildered and moved by this, so he entered his room and asked B about the method to get rich. B said: "I have a sandalwood Bodhisattva that is very efficacious. I can ask for it on your behalf." He immediately set up a table, burned incense, and after a while, B said that the Bodhisattva had already told him that you must prepare a five-tael gold ingot and throw it into the Huangpu River, and your fortune will arrive. He also said that this matter must not be told to others under any circumstances, otherwise, not only will you not get rich, but there will be misfortune. A believed this to be true and went home to raise money and exchange it for a five-tael gold ingot, which he sent to B. B took A to the Huangpu Bund, recited a few spells, and then threw the gold ingot into the river. Afterwards, they returned to the hotel, and B said to A that he would see wealth in three days. However, after three days passed, there was no news. A went to B's place again to inquire, and B again said that the Bodhisattva had said that you must throw another gold ingot into the river, and you will definitely get rich. A again went home to take the money and exchange it for a gold ingot, which he gave to B, and B did the same as before. (The gold ingots used twice were wrapped in white paper by B in the inn, and he secretly switched them.) A was still unaware and still believed it to be true. Unexpectedly, several days later, he still did not see any wealth. A went to B's place again to question him, and B said: "The wealth has arrived! You should quickly rent a house." A immediately went to Guangyuli, Nanyang Bridge, and rented a floor in a certain number. B then said to A: "You should quickly raise 2,000 yuan, and it will turn into 200,000." A said: "The money for the gold ingots was already pieced together, and it is really difficult to raise this huge sum now." B again said: "How can you miss such a good opportunity? If you don't have the full amount, you should raise 1,000 yuan, and I will also raise 1,000 yuan." A was still deluded and happily went home and pieced together the money. He also borrowed 1,000 yuan from friends and brought it to Guangyuli. B also prepared 1,000 yuan, all banknotes wrapped in paper into two packages. He set up a table, burned incense, and ordered A to kneel on the ground and kowtow. B took the opportunity to carry the money and flee. When A got up, B was gone. When he checked the two packages of banknotes, he found that they had turned into hell money. At this point, A finally realized that he had been fooled and regretted it, but it was too late.</p>
<h3>Zhou Rangsan Case Three Kidnappers Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Wang Aqing Sentenced to Six Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhang Jibao Acquitted and Released</p>
<p>On the morning of the 27th of last month, Zhou Rangsan, an employee of Mei Foo, had just gotten into his car at his residence at 1360 Hart Road, intending to go to work, when he was suddenly kidnapped by gangsters. The Jing'an Temple Police Station pursued him to a gangster den near the Hongqiao Road Airport that day and rescued the victim. In addition to killing the gangster A Da on the spot, they arrested five men and women, including Jiang Haoyuan. The confessions of those involved have been reported in this newspaper. The court sentenced Jiang to death in the case yesterday morning. The police station escorted the defendants to the Special District Court, where Judge Sun Yuansheng presided over the second court and ordered Jiang to be brought forward for questioning. After the names were checked, the sentence was immediately announced: Jiang Haoyuan and Yang Miaoquan were each sentenced to death for the crime of jointly kidnapping for ransom. Qiu Jinpu was sentenced to death for the crime of helping to kidnap for ransom. Wang Aqing was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for the crime of conspiring to kidnap for ransom, and deprived of public rights for ten years. The judgment was final. The number of days of pre-trial detention was allowed to be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for one day. Zhang Xingbao was acquitted. Two pistols, fifteen bullets, two magazines, a pair of black glasses, and a threatening letter were all confiscated.</p>
<h3>Mei Fei Case to Be Sentenced</h3>
<p>The Court Concluded the Interrogation Yesterday</p>
<p>Hu Yongquan Still Awaits Arrest</p>
<p>The case of the prostitute Mei Fei (also known as Chen Junxia) being accused by Tan Meiying, the wife of the guest Zhao Guangzu, of colluding with Hu Yongquan to defraud her of title deeds and other items has been repeatedly interrogated by the Special District Court. Hu has evaded arrest, and Mei Fei was ordered to pay a bail of 1,000 yuan. This has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun Yuan continued the trial. Hu Yongquan has not yet been arrested. The plaintiff's lawyer, Lu Qi, requested that the Mei Fei part be processed first. The court allowed it. Therefore, the plaintiff requested that the amount of Mei Fei's bail be increased because the four title deeds that were defrauded were more than 21 mu of land, with a value of more than 20,000, and a bail of 1,000 yuan was too light. Judge Sun then summoned Zhao Guangzu to testify about everything that happened after he met Hu Yongquan. Zhao repeated the entire story of how Mei Fei introduced him to Hu Yongquan and how he entrusted Hu to buy a car. According to Mei Fei, she met Zhao Guangzu through a guest surnamed Gu in May or June of last year. Zhao visited her twice, then came to her place for tea. Zhao said that he was studying at Guanghua University and had never married. He wanted to marry her and said that his property rights were still managed by others on his behalf, and he asked her to forgive him for this after the marriage. Near the end of the year, Zhao asked her to withdraw from the brothel and rent a house to live together. At this time, he said that his property rights were managed by his sister on his behalf, and he said that she would belong to him when she got married. She believed his words and went into debt to make a living, owing more than 2,000 yuan. As for Hu Yongquan, she met him at the mahjong table. The meeting between Hu and Zhao was not introduced by her, and she did not give Zhao's title deeds to her. Judge Sun pointed out that Zhao had testified that the title deeds were handed over to Mei Fei to be transferred to Hu, but Mei Fei denied it. Therefore, he asked Zhao if he had any evidence in this regard. Zhao said that they had a deep emotional connection at the time and that they had directly handed them over, and there was no evidence and no third party was present. Judge Sun then threw two letters from Zhao to Mei Fei submitted by the defendant's lawyer to Zhao to read. After Zhao read them, he denied that the letters were written by him and requested a handwriting analysis. He then wrote (Chen Junxia, Yulin Lane, Guling Road) and other words in court as instructed by the judge. The lawyers on both sides debated each other, and the court announced that the verdict would be announced next Tuesday. Hu Yongquan's part will be heard separately after he is arrested.</p>
<h3>Russian Bodyguard Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Unable to Repay Alcohol Debts</p>
<p>Suddenly Kills Himself with a Pistol</p>
<p>Li Jinsheng, a director of a certain bank, hired a Russian, Bi Ge Fsky, as a bodyguard for self-defense. The Russian was addicted to alcohol, and his monthly salary was not enough to cover his drinking expenses. His alcohol debts accumulated to more than 400 yuan. Recently, he was forced by creditors to repay the debts, and he had no money to repay them. Therefore, he had the idea of committing suicide. The day before yesterday, Li went to Weihaiwei Road for business around 7 p.m. and ordered the Russian to bring a defensive pistol with him. When the car passed Muir Ming Road, Bi suddenly shot himself with a pistol and died. A nearby Indian police officer at No. 473 saw this and immediately sent the pistol to the police station to report the incident. Detectives were dispatched to carry the Russian's body to the Fei Lun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo from the Special District Court went to the morgue for an examination. Lu Sheng, a Russian who lived with the deceased at 1981 Aiwenyi Road, testified that the deceased did commit suicide because he was unable to repay his alcohol debts. Li also sent a servant, Wu Zuoqing, to the case, saying that the deceased was addicted to alcohol, and his suits and leather shoes had all been pawned to buy alcohol. Li planned to dismiss him at the end of the month, but unfortunately, he committed suicide. He was willing to pay for the coffin and burial expenses. Judge Guo then ordered Lu Sheng to claim the body and ordered Li Jinsheng to purchase clothes and a coffin and hand them over to Lu Sheng for burial.</p>
<h3>Old Murder Case Reopened</h3>
<p>The Wife of a Military Officer Died Tragically Five Years Ago</p>
<p>Zhang Gu's Mother and Son Accused of Murder</p>
<p>Zhao Zhang, the sister of Zhang Jinfu from Yancheng, married Zhao Fengrong, who held the position of battalion commander during the warlord era. In 1924, during the Qilu War, Zhao was a frontline military officer on the Qilu side and died in the battle of Liuhe. At that time, Zhao Zhang was still a young woman living in a dream. When the bad news came, she was grief-stricken, but she also received a pension. Zhang Gu, a concubine of Zhang Xuhua, a quartermaster in Zhao's battalion, was Zhao Zhang's godmother. She brought Zhao Zhang to Shanghai to return the remains of her deceased husband. On May 7th of the lunar calendar in 1925, Zhao Zhang's body was suddenly discovered at the Wangjiazhai in Gaolang Bridge, not far from her residence. At that time, the former Prosecutor's Office verified the identity and collected the body and investigated the murder. At that time, the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District received an anonymous letter alleging that Zhang Gu had a major suspicion. When the body was verified, Zhang Gu showed recognition, and the police station also investigated, but there was no evidence to support it, so they did not pursue it. Last month, Zhang Jinfu went to the Yangshupu Police Station to accuse Zhang Gu and her son Zhang Wanchang of murdering his sister. They were immediately arrested and sent to the Special District Court. Because the case was originally a mainland case, it was transferred to the local court for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Public Opposition to Takashashi Sandbar Project: Foreign Company Building Oil Tanks</h3>
<p>The German-owned "Deutche Vacuum Oel Actien Gesellschaft" (德士古, known as "Texas Company" in Chinese transliteration) has been attempting to purchase land from residents on Takashashi Sandbar (高橋沙) to construct oil tanks for storing dangerous goods. This has been repeatedly opposed by the local residents. The matter has not yet been resolved, but the foreign company has now hired laborers to begin construction in recent days, leading to strong opposition from the sandbar residents. Yesterday, two to three hundred people, including local public organizations and sandbar residents, held a meeting on the sandbar. After discussion, they put forward five reasons: (1) The Texas Company is encroaching into the interior, violating the trade treaty. (2) The company is violating the Takashashi Sandbar land regulations of the Ministry of Finance. (3) It is violating the regulations for building oil tanks. (4) It has not submitted an application for approval to the government but has forcibly started construction. (5) It is violating local public opinion by forcibly acquiring land from the people and cutting off the livelihoods of farmers. Based on the above reasons, they should immediately petition the municipal government to confiscate the sandbar land that the Texas Company forcibly purchased against public opinion, in order to maintain the rule of law and serve as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Tang Huei-hsuan sues his wife for adultery. Verdict:</h3>
<p>Tsou Ai-chen and Chen Ken-wei are not guilty.</p>
<p>Economic Doctor Tang Huei-hsuan (唐惠玄, also known as Tsung-tzu and Shih-an) filed a private lawsuit in the criminal court of the local court, accusing his wife, Tsou Ai-chen (鄒愛貞), and Chen Ken-wei (陳根偉) of adultery. The court hearing was held on the 13th of this month by Judge Wu Chen (吳振), who considered the arguments to be concluded and scheduled the verdict for the 18th. Details were recorded in the 14th issue of this newspaper. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. At 2:30 pm, Judge Wu opened the third court to announce the verdict. The plaintiff, Tang Huei-hsuan, was absent. The defendants, Tsou Ai-chen and Chen Ken-wei, arrived with their lawyer, Yen Yin-wu (嚴蔭武). After the judge briefly questioned Tsou, Chen, etc., regarding their ages, he stood up and announced the verdict. Briefly, the plaintiff Tang Huei-hsuan's accusations lacked sufficient evidence. The defendants Tsou Ai-chen and Chen Ken-wei were both found not guilty. The court adjourned after the verdict.</p>
<h3>Malay Peninsula: Cable Regarding Old and Weak Chinese Laborers Returning Home</h3>
<p>The Consul in Penang, Yang Nien-tsu (楊念祖), recently cabled the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stating that since the price of rubber and tin has fallen in the Malay Peninsula, many Chinese immigrants have lost their jobs. The elderly, weak, and disabled are in a situation where they neither can return nor can stay. The Penang Ping Boon Association (檳榔嶼平奉會館) announced on the 5th of this month that any Chinese immigrants who are elderly, weak, or disabled, unable to work, and wish to return to their home country but lack travel funds can register at the association. The association will recommend them to the Chinese Affairs Commissioner to send them back to China. From the 6th to the 13th, 118 people came to register. The Chinese Affairs Commissioner confirmed that there were 161 people in total, including the elderly, weak, and disabled, those who went to the office to petition on their own, and those who were ill. They took the "Shelly Maru" (舍利丸) to return to their home country at 3:00 PM that afternoon. This is a special report for your review.</p>
<h3>Hunan Rice Not Yet Shipped to Shanghai in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>It is now the Autumn Equinox, and the early rice harvest in various villages has been gradually completed. New early rice from both the northern and southern rice markets in this city has also been successively arriving on the market. However, rice prices remain firm and have not fallen. According to rice merchants yesterday, the reason is that the amount of new early rice arriving is small. Although Hunan has had a bumper harvest this year, the rice from farmers there is fully stored and piled up like mountains, making it impossible to transport it out of the province. Therefore, those in the rice industry in this city who go to purchase it have not yet shipped it to Shanghai in large quantities, so the market price remains high. However, with the assurance of a bumper harvest in various villages this year, it is expected that in about a month or so, large quantities of new early rice will arrive on the market from various villages. At that time, it is hoped that rice prices will fall.</p>
<h3>France: Charity Bazaar for Orphan Relief</h3>
<p>To be held on October 5th</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the French Orphan Relief Association (法國孤兒救濟會) holds a charity bazaar every year as usual. It is said that the date for this year's event has been chosen as October 5th in the Gregorian calendar and will be held at Gu Ka-chai Park (顧家宅公園) (entrance at 11 Huanlong Road). The venue will have various children's games, and a small train has been specially set up. The train has a dragon head and 15 cars that can accommodate 60 children to tour the venue. Admission tickets are 40 cents for children and one dollar for adults. There will be no additional charge for various games in the arena. The arena will also have beautiful French children's toys for sale at reasonable prices. It is expected that more Chinese gentlemen and ladies will participate in this event than last year.</p>
<h3>Several Locations in the French Concession: Electricity to be Temporarily Suspended Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The French Electricity Company (法商電燈公司) announced that due to line work on Avenue Joffre to Avenue Albert and Avenue Doumer, the power supply will be suspended from 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM on the 20th of this month. This is being announced to ensure everyone is aware.</p>
<h3>Electrical Company: Revised Procedures for Notifying Customers of Changes to Electrical Equipment</h3>
<p>To ensure safety, the Electrical Company (電氣公司) requires that all customer-installed electrical equipment pass inspection before a meter is installed and power is connected. This procedure is specified in its operational regulations as follows: "The company will send personnel to inspect within five days from the date of receiving the application form, power supply contract, and deposit. If it is considered qualified, the meter will be installed and power connected. Otherwise, the company will fill out a modification notice indicating the points that need to be modified, which the customer will forward to the electrical materials store or electrical contractor for modification within a specified period. After the modification, another notification will be sent for re-inspection..." Previously, the Water and Electricity Association believed that having the customer forward the modification notice caused delays and that it would be better for the company to directly deliver it to the contractor to save time. They petitioned the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to correct this. The bureau considered it feasible and ordered each company to amend the inspection clause in its business regulations accordingly. It is now known that each company has complied and changed it to "(...the company will fill out a modification notice...)". This has also been reported by the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities to the Municipal Government for record.</p>
<h3>Shaohsing Native Place Association: Seeking a Youth Who Has Become Disillusioned With Life</h3>
<p>According to Hu Huan-ran (胡煥然) from Shangyu (上虞), the Shaohsing Native Place Association (紹興旅滬同鄉會) reports that his brother, Zan-ran (贊然), 18 years old, wearing a white Zhongshan suit, Western-style hair, and leather shoes, came to Shanghai from his hometown on the 10th of this month. A few days later, his family received a letter from him stating that he was coughing up blood after arriving in Shanghai and had decided to commit suicide due to his pessimistic thoughts. The letter did not mention where he intended to commit suicide. His whereabouts are unknown. It is hoped that anyone who knows his whereabouts will report to the association. His family will offer a substantial reward.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government: Banning Private Cemeteries From Simultaneously Establishing Funeral Homes</h3>
<p>There are quite a few funeral homes (丙舍) in this city. The issue of dealing with existing temporary coffins has already become difficult. Recently, the Municipal Health Bureau discovered that some private cemeteries are also simultaneously establishing funeral homes. The bureau believes that this has a significant impact on dealing with the issue of temporary coffins. To reduce difficulties and facilitate management, they have petitioned the municipal government to prohibit all private cemeteries from simultaneously establishing funeral homes. After receiving the petition, the municipal government stated that the nature of cemeteries is to provide a permanent solution for the disposal of coffins. Simultaneously establishing funeral homes undermines the purpose of establishing cemeteries and is inconsistent with cemetery regulations. Therefore, it should be banned. Yesterday, they specifically instructed the bureau that private cemeteries should not be allowed to simultaneously establish funeral homes in the future. The bureau was also instructed to investigate in detail how many private cemeteries in this city have already established funeral homes and submit a report for review in order to comply with the regulations promulgated by the Ministry and ban them accordingly.</p>
<h3>Rice Shop Partner Bankrupted, Family Ruined</h3>
<p>Fortunately, the shop owner showed compassion.</p>
<p>The lost money will not be pursued.</p>
<p>Bao Ming-sheng (鮑明生) from Chuansha (川沙) was a partner in a rice shop in Zhoupu (周浦), Pudong. Last month, when the new rice from Pudong came on the market, the shop's daily sales of new brown rice were substantial. Bao was assigned by the shop to be stationed in Shanghai as a salesman to transport the rice to Shanghai for milling. In the middle of last month, Bao received 1,200 yuan in cash in Zhabei and took it back to Zhoupu. When he was about to hand the money over to the accountant in the shop, he was surprised to find that the money was no longer in his bag. Bao searched everywhere in a panic, but to no avail. The shop refused to take responsibility because the amount of money lost was too large, so they demanded compensation from Bao's introducer. The introducer interceded with the shop, suggesting that Bao and the shop each bear half of the loss. Bao immediately paid 300 yuan, and the remaining half was to be deducted from his salary in installments. Bao was unable to borrow money from relatives and friends and had to sell his ancestral farmland, which was still not enough. Bao's wife argued with him when he sold the land. Bao had been looking haggard and often sighing since he lost the shop's money, and the shop had assigned his sales position to another partner. Bao thought that the shop considered him useless, so he had been restless lately. A few days ago, he was sent to the countryside to collect goods. Bao took the opportunity to return home, but his wife's relatives ridiculed him for going bankrupt. Upon hearing this, he became very angry and swallowed red-headed matches and attempted suicide. People discovered this and sent him to the hospital for treatment. When Bao arrived home and learned of this, he fainted immediately. Bao's mother saw this and shouted, also fainting to the ground. Although she was awakened, Bao's mother's health was poor, and medical treatment was ineffective. She died the day before yesterday. Bao suddenly developed a mental illness. Bao's wife is still in the hospital. After Bao's mother died, relatives purchased a coffin and held a funeral. Bao's shop owner, upon hearing that Bao had ruined his family and harmed himself, felt very compassionate and did not want Bao to pay back the lost money. He sent someone to return the 300 yuan that Bao had already paid to the shop to Bao and told him to rest and recover. Bao's relatives sent a letter of thanks and it was heard that Bao's relatives plan to send Bao to the Shanghai New Puyu Hall (新普育堂) for medical treatment so that he can recover quickly and return to normal.</p>
<h3>Detention of Workers Involved in a Brawl</h3>
<p>Yang Bin-fa (楊彬發) and others, carpenters residing in the Hung-mu Gang (紅木帮) of Huining Road (徽寗路) in the Southern City (南巿), were involved in an incident. Chen Jin-fa (陳金發), an apprentice dyer at the Tong-de Silk Weaving Factory (同德絲光廠), bumped into Yang Bin-fa due to an eye ailment. Yang then hit Chen, and Chen Jin-fa fled into the factory. They arranged to meet at the Puyu Road (普育路) teahouse within the jurisdiction of the Second Precinct, Second Division (二區二分所) at 7 or 8 a.m. yesterday (the 18th). Yang Bin-fa invited forty to fifty people, and the dyeing gang also gathered about seventy or eighty people. Each held iron and wooden sticks, creating a very menacing atmosphere, as if facing a major enemy. Seeing that the dyeing gang had more people, Yang Bin-fa feared that they would not be able to withstand the attack and reported to Chief Guo (郭) of the Second Precinct, Second Division. Chief Guo, upon hearing the report, stated that the group dared to gather a crowd, carry weapons, and engage in a brawl based on a grudge, which was completely illegal and undisciplined. He immediately dispatched Patrol Officer Jin (金) with police officers to suppress and arrest them. By the time they arrived, the gangs were already fighting. Under the command of Patrol Officer Jin, the police officers bravely arrested them. However, since the members of the gangs were all muscular and strong, it was very difficult to catch them. As a result, six members of the Hung-mu Gang, including Yang Bin-fa, and four members of the dyeing gang, including Ding Qi-yi (丁七一), were arrested.

<h3>Pedicab Crushes a Person to Death</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, Wang Si-tong (王思統), a Northerner aged 27 who worked at the Public Security Bureau, was driving a motorized pedicab on the Jing'an Temple Road (靜安寺路) in West Shanghai. Two people were riding with him. He accidentally lost control and the pedicab overturned, crushing Wang's abdomen. He was barely breathing. West Detective No. 147 from the Xinzha Police Station (新閘捕房) arrived, hired a car, and sent him to Renji Hospital (仁濟醫院) for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died at around 10:00 PM last night. His friend, Chang Juan-qiu (常娟球), 27 years old, also suffered skin abrasions on his hands and feet. After examination by a doctor, he was found to be unharmed.</p>
<h3>Pedicab Driver Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>Zhang Da-xiang (張大向), a pedicab driver from Tongzhou (通州) residing at No. 81 Zhangjiabang (張家浜), Qiqihar Road (齊齊哈爾路), West Shanghai, was 40 years old. Due to the rising cost of living and his meager income, which was insufficient to cover expenses, he became disillusioned with life. He took advantage of a moment when no one was watching and hanged himself the night before last. The person living with him discovered it, but it was too late to save him. He immediately reported it to the police station in charge, which reported it to the local court. Yesterday afternoon, the prosecutor was dispatched to the scene to confirm that he had died by hanging. They ordered the preparation of a coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Monk Commits Sodomy on Young Apprentice</h3>
<p>Chen A-liu (陳阿六年), 31 years old from Tongzhou (通州), runs a pastry shop at No. 56 Tangfang Alley (糖坊衖) outside the Little South Gate (小南門). Liu Lao-er (劉老二), who lives at No. 70 in the same alley, owed him more than 1,000 cash. After repeatedly demanding payment without success, he sent his 13-year-old apprentice, Zheng He-hou (鄭和厚), to demand payment at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. It happened that Liu was out, and Miao Wang (妙旺), a 24-year-old monk from Anhui who had been a monk since childhood, a companion of a monk named Jie San (戒三), was waiting for him in the parlor. Since he had not met Jie San, he sat and waited. At that time, the apprentice Zheng He-hou was about to leave because Liu was not there. Unexpectedly, the monk Miao Wang saw that Zheng had a pleasing appearance, much like a girl. He was immediately filled with lust and had evil thoughts. He forcibly dragged Zheng upstairs into the bedroom, pressed him down on the bed, took off his pants, and committed sodomy. The apprentice Zheng was in unbearable pain and cried out loudly, but his mouth was covered to prevent him from making a sound, and he was further threatened. Because Zheng was weak and unable to resist, he was violated. Afterwards, he felt inflammation and pain in his anus. He pulled up his pants and staggered out, tearfully recounting everything to his master. When Chen heard about this, he was furious and immediately rushed over, but the monk Miao Wang had already fled. Although he searched for him in vain, he could not find him. At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, he encountered him on the road and immediately grabbed him and called out to Police Officer Miao Dian-ke (苗殿科) of the 26th post, who brought him back to the First Precinct, Third Division (一區三分所) under the charge of Chief Jin (金). After a preliminary interrogation, he ordered a document to be prepared and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Thugs Violently Beat Boatmen</h3>
<p>The Problem of Docking at the Yitai Pier (義泰碼頭) in Pudong</p>
<p>The Evil Bullying and Strange Behavior of Ruffians</p>
<p>At around 12:00 PM yesterday morning, three people, each carrying serious injuries, reported to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team (上海巿公安局水巡隊), claiming that Chen Guang-gao (陳廣高), Liu Xu-yun (劉旭雲), and Xu De-cai (徐得財) were all boatmen from Jiangbei (江北) who made a living by sailing barges. This morning, when they docked their boats near the Yitai Pier (義泰碼頭) in Bailianjing (白蓮涇), a boat came to force its way into the dock and squeezed them out. When they protested slightly, they were gathered and attacked by a dozen or so people, each carrying iron rulers, wooden sticks, and other weapons, causing them to be weak and unable to resist, suffering injuries all over their bodies. They requested that the matter be investigated. When the police were dispatched to investigate and arrest the perpetrators, they had all dispersed. Only Gao Er-lang (高二郞), a boatman from Chongming (崇明), was apprehended. The team was instructed to prepare a document explaining the incident and submit it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation. Subsequently, it was heard that the Bailianjing Police Station (白蓮涇派出所) of the Third Team of the same patrol team also had a boatman with a head injury bleeding profusely, claiming that Wu Ji-lang (吳基郞), 30 years old from Chongming, made a living by boating. This morning, when he docked his boat next to the Yitai Pier to prepare to load coal, three Jiangbei barge boats rushed over and forced him to move his boat. Because he refused, he was attacked by a crowd of people who beat him and struck his head with an axe, causing him to be injured and bleed. He requested a thorough investigation. The police station dispatched police officers to investigate and arrest the perpetrators. The ringleaders were nowhere to be found. Only Hao Ji-lin (郝紀林), Liu Chang-fu (劉長福), Chen Ming-guo (陳明國), and other boatmen from the three boats were arrested, along with the axes and other weapons. They were brought back and transferred to the Southern City General Team. They then prepared a document explaining the incident and submitted it to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Cargo Ship Collides, Killing a Girl</h3>
<p>The Beikou (北口) sandboat Jin Zeng-li (金增利) was fully loaded with bamboo, kiln goods, etc., and was sailing to Yingkou. It was docked at the southern end of the Jiu Ji Pier (久記碼頭) in the Southern City. Yesterday, it was preparing to set sail and hire a police boat to leave the harbor. However, when the Jin ship turned around to release the mooring ropes, it ...</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>happened that the Jiangbei (江北) boat Jiang Zhong-he (蔣仲和), carrying Rongji (榮記) foreign goods and candy, was heading to Minhang. Seeing that the tugboat was traveling at full speed, it was trying to avoid it, but it was too late. It was struck by the stern of the Jin ship. The load of the Jiang ship was very heavy. After being hit, the bow of the ship broke off and gradually sank. Fortunately, nearby boats on the Pudong beach saw this and tried their best to help, dragging the Jiang ship to the beach and stranding it. When the collision occurred, Jiang's wife was holding a girl and sitting on the stern of the ship, sewing clothes. She was knocked into the river. She was rescued by a neighboring boat, but the girl was not rescued. Jiang is now negotiating with the Jin ship for compensation for the loss. It is heard that the candy on the ship was insured against water damage.</p>
<h3>County Government Prevents Bandits From Fleeing Into the Territory</h3>
<p>Xiong Shihui (熊式輝), Commander-in-Chief for the Suppression of Bandits in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, has learned that the bandit leader Tai Bao A Shu (太保阿書) has fled back to Jinshan to loot. He has appointed Hu Zhengji (胡正濟) as the temporary commander for bandit suppression in Jinshan, Fengxian, Qingpu, and Pinghu counties, with a deadline to clear them out by the end of September. It is known that Tai Bao A Shu's bandit gang still has three to four hundred people. Although they have been attacked by land and naval forces and police after looting Jinshan, their strength has not been dispersed. They are currently hiding in Gao Xu (高墟), which is located at the border of Qingpu and Wujiang. The Shanghai County Government has received successive telegrams from the Bandit Suppression Department of the Three Provinces and the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department, ordering the county to launch a major suppression campaign in the coming days. If the bandits flee into the territory, the county police should assist in the operation to eliminate any future problems. County Magistrate Yan Zuo (嚴縣長作) has ordered the County Public Security Bureau (縣公安局) to instruct all sub-bureaus bordering neighboring counties to comply and report the bandits' situation at any time.</p>

The five-lap motorcycle contest between Allen and Ye Sheng (葉聲) in the fourth event drew a lot of applause. The China-Japan-Annam (Vietnam) three-nation race in the fifth event was particularly eye-catching. Each country sent two of their best riders. China sent Zheng Long-fei (鄭龍飛) and Gao Yong-nian (高永年). After ten laps of fierce fighting, Zheng Long-fei of China won the championship. Zheng's driving skills were as agile as a dragon flying or a swallow soaring, so his name Long-fei (龍飛) can be said to be truly fitting. The leading car race in the sixth event was also one of the highlights of last night. In the end, the victory also went to Zhu Liang (朱良), a Chinese athlete.</p>

<h3>Wende Lane Residents Association Established</h3>
<p>The houses in Wende Lane (文德里) on Yangshupu Road (楊樹浦路) have been built for more than ten years and have never been repaired, resulting in disrepair. The houses are not adjacent to any roads, and the access roads are not owned by the homeowners. The land is extremely low-lying, and it is muddy when it rains. Heavy rains turn the area into a swamp. Therefore, the residents are mostly hardworking workers from nearby factories. The rent has been increased three times over the years. Originally, Xu Wen-ji (徐文記) collected the rent, but recently it has been changed to Wufengchangji Zhuang (五豐昌記莊). Last month, Zhuang made some minor repairs to the outside of the houses and raised the rent for the fourth time, from 7.5 yuan per building to 11 yuan. The residents were shocked and unanimously refused to accept the rent increase, leading to a dispute. The residents then initiated the organization of a tenants' association to deal with the situation. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the initiators convened a meeting of all the tenants to discuss how to proceed. More than eighty tenants attended the meeting. The meeting was opened with a bell, followed by ceremonial procedures. Wu De-xiang (吳德祥) was elected as chairman, and Gu Feng-qi (顧峰奇) as recorder. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting and the significance of organizing the tenants' association. Then, the tenants unanimously stated that the rent has been increased three times in recent years, and this time the increase is almost half of the total amount. In this time of expensive rice and firewood and difficult living conditions, they cannot afford such a burden. They absolutely do not agree with the rent increase. It was resolved that (1) a tenants' association would be actively organized; (2) Jiang Jun (蔣俊), Shen Xin-you (沈新友), Sun Li-yao (孫笠卿), Guo Zheng-qi (郭政啟), Shao Yu-cheng (邵玉成), Wu De-xiang, Tian Bao-zhu (田寶珠), Xu Ru-ming (許如明), Liu Sheng-pei (劉生培), Chen Chang-fu (陳長富), Zhou Yuan-kui (周願奎) and eleven others were elected as preparation committee members; (3) funding would be temporarily sought by the initiators, and the funds would be repaid when membership fees are collected in the future; (4) rent would not be paid temporarily until the landlord clearly stated that they would not raise the rent; (5) Gu Feng-qi would be the honorary secretary. The meeting adjourned, and it was already five o'clock.</p>

<h3>Model Military Man Luo Xiankai</h3>
<p>— Fang Er</p>
<p>For the past ten days, fellow Hunanese in Beijing have been telling each other in astonishment about Luo Xiankai, the model military man, in connection with the recent communist unrest in Changsha.</p>
<p>Luo Xiankai was from the eastern countryside of Changsha. As a child, he was poor and herded pigs and cattle. Occasionally dissatisfied with his master, he would angrily beg for food in all directions. Later, he joined the army as a camp follower. After a long time, he became a soldier and eventually rose to the rank of brigade commander through merit. He had been in the military for nearly forty years, moving and fighting in battles. He often spoke to people with relish about his experiences and said that he had nothing when he started and that he was content with his current status. People admired him for this. When he was a brigade commander, the Hunan authorities were considering reducing the size of the army. He was the first to request retirement to his hometown, setting an example for the other generals. Public opinion called him a model military man, mainly because he only reached the rank of brigade commander and had less than a million in assets. He retired when he thought he was rich and noble enough, which is rare among modern military men.</p>
<p>He built a villa in the middle of the Xiang River on the Shui Lu Zhou (Water and Land Island) west of Changsha. He spent the summer there to escape the heat and returned to his hometown in the winter. He often carried money into the city alone and brought goods home. Dressed in coarse clothes and cloth shoes, he looked like a country elder. Cart drivers and boatmen who knew he was Brigade Commander Luo competed to be hired by him, hoping to receive dozens or hundreds of cash as a reward.</p>
<p>Although he was sixty or seventy years old, he looked like he was in his fifties. Because he was a veteran general from Hunan and was old, fellow military officers from the same hometown, including Cheng Qian and Zhao Hengti, all respectfully called him "Elder Ding." His courtesy name was Ding'an, just as the Beiyang military men called Duan Zhiqian "Elder Zhi." Even his old superior, Tan Weigong, treated him with great respect.</p>
<p>After his retirement, although the Hunan authorities did not give him any military posts, they still entrusted him with the positions of director of the Changsha militia and director-general of the Hunan Province Clearance Office from the Zhao Hengti era onwards. Hunan militia forces, from Zeng Guofan until now, are known for their indiscriminate killings. Each county has countless militia sub-bureaus, which are countless killing machines. Provincial and county general bureaus and local authorities cannot control them and simply ignore them. They are relied upon to suppress bandits. Since the suppression of the communists, the Hunan militia has killed countless people. This time, when the communists entered Changsha, they were satisfied to get Luo Xiankai, the director-general of the militia. Alas, the communists' means of revenge were truly cruel.</p>
<h3>A Record of Shandong Provincial Gold Coins</h3>
<p>— Dingsheng</p>
<p>China's monetary system has reached the extreme of disorder. Since the late Qing dynasty, those who have discussed the monetary system have known that only the adoption of the gold standard could compete with the world. However, this has never been implemented due to the lack of gold production and the emptiness of the national treasury. However, local authorities in various provinces have occasionally independently raised funds to mint provincial gold coins. People only know that Tang Jiyao minted Yunnan provincial gold coins after the success of the National Protection War, but they do not know that Zhang Zongchang of Shandong also minted gold coins in the Republic of China Year 15. This is something that those who study currency should know. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, Zhang Zongchang had seized both the Yan and Lu provinces, so the Tianjin General Mint, the largest mint in China, also belonged to Zhang. This mint was founded by Li Hongzhang during his tenure as Governor-General of Zhili and had complete facilities. It could mint two million silver coins and three million copper subsidiary coins per day. Zhang then recommended Li Houzuo and Ren Yuan'dao as supervisors and directors. Li and Ren were very keen on reforming the monetary system and proposed to mint gold coins using the gold from Shandong.</p>
<p>The Shandong peninsula is rich in gold, but unfortunately, the mining methods have not been improved and people pay little attention to it. According to the Shandong Provincial Gold Coin Plan compiled by Li and Ren, if the Shandong gold mines were subsidized and reorganized by the provincial government, they could produce one million taels of gold per year. This would allow for the minting of four million ten-yuan gold coins per year. Before the gold standard was established, merchants would accept the coins at market prices and the government and people would benefit. Zhang urged them to proceed and ordered the initial minting of ten-yuan and twenty-yuan coins. Li and Ren then planned carefully, hired Yang Zijia, a graduate of a French university, and Li Zuxun, a German chemistry PhD. Italian engravers were hired to meticulously manufacture steel dies, which took months to complete. Their design was even more beautiful than British and American gold coins. The reverse side featured a fire dragon and the twelve symbols of imperial authority, while the obverse side featured ears of grain and the words "Shandong Provincial Gold Coin, Republic of China Year 15." Zhang was very pleased with this and ordered the minting to begin. The first batch of 200,000 coins were minted, and people rushed to collect them, but few circulated in the market. When the National Revolutionary Army marched out of the Yangtze River, Ren went to Hankou and Li resigned due to illness. The matter then ended. This matter was very short-lived and few coins were minted. Recently, they have been bought up by people from the east and are almost exhausted. Few people know about it. I am writing this to provide a page for the history of the Chinese monetary system.</p>
<h3>The Principal Swallowing Pears</h3>
<p>— Guqu Yunji</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and the students are returning to school with their book bags. This is a commonplace event and not worth mentioning in detail. However, I recently heard a story about a pear-swallowing incident at a certain girls' school, which was tortuous, humorous, and thought-provoking. Therefore, I casually record it to make my point.</p>
<p>Soliciting a Letter: There is a girl here who is graceful and considers herself a good scholar. She boldly sent a letter to someone expressing her feelings. This girl has always been unwilling to be in debt to others. Thus, there are many troubles in the Central Plains.</p>
<p>Gifting Pears: A certain young man is closest to the girl. Their correspondence is also the most frequent, with almost two letters a day. Recently, he returned from Tianjin and brought back more than ten Dalia pears, which he sent to the girl. The girl was out, so the principal obtained the pears and a love letter. The letter was commonplace, so the principal did not intend to investigate. However, the principal was from the north and knew that these pears were not easy to obtain, so he thought of a way to deal with them.</p>
<p>Swallowing the Pears: The principal took the pears and the letter back to her office, summoned the girl and questioned her. The girl swore that there was nothing between them, so the principal did not investigate. Although the girl knew that the pears were valuable, she did not dare to mention them because the principal had not mentioned them either. Thus, the principal and her close staff were able to enjoy the taste of their hometown to the full.</p>
<p>Epilogue: A certain person on the staff ate her fill and smiled as she told people about it. The girl thought about it and was dissatisfied. She resolutely went to ask the principal, intending to ask for the gift back. The principal gave a jumbled response and told her to discuss it later and that she would definitely find a way to compensate her. The girl retreated, but I don't know if this person from the south will be able to vomit out something true from the fake.</p>
<h3>The Flavors of Autumn: More at Huishan</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>A trip to Huishan in Wuxi is more rewarding in the autumn than in the spring. Spring outings are only for visual pleasure, while autumn outings can also satisfy the palate. Recently, as the west wind rises, a refreshing atmosphere greets people, and the mountain's fine fruits are available in season. The most common are the four-cornered water caltrop and the osmanthus chestnut. They are sold everywhere. Guests who climb the Zhulu Mountain Villa can enjoy the four-cornered water caltrop with Two Springs tea, which can be said to be a particularly flavorful experience. This water caltrop is produced in the nearby Sunxiang and Da Xuankou areas. Whenever it is time to pick the water caltrop, you can see girls on the lake in a small wooden basin, gazing over the vast expanse of water. Their misty hair emerges from the shimmering water, captivating and astounding people. These girls navigate the dangerous waters with ease and grace. This is a remarkable scene and an extraordinary skill. However, because the output is large, the quality is good and the price is low, less than two hundred cash per catty. Osmanthus chestnuts are very precious and expensive. Distant visitors buy them and give them to relatives and friends as a valuable gift. The price is one silver dollar for two catties. In fact, according to the people of Wuxi, the only true Huishan chestnuts that are of the osmanthus variety and contain the taste of osmanthus are the five trees in front of the Niangniang Hall (an ancient temple). The rest are merely imitations and should only be called Huishan chestnuts, not osmanthus chestnuts. Towards the end of autumn, when the chestnuts in the mountains are almost gone, residents secretly bring in goods from other places and mix them in to profit. At that time, even Huishan chestnuts cannot be obtained. I say that there are few things in the world where name and reality match. Most people are simply eating what they hear and can rarely discern the taste. So don't blame them for being deceived.</p>
<h3>A Record of Golden Needles Saving the World</h3>
<p>— Yifen</p>
<p>The golden needle is the oldest form of medicine in our country. Mr. Huang Shiping, a national doctor in the late Qing Dynasty, was famous for it, and my friend Mr. Fang Shenyu inherited his teachings. Shenyu once held a military command in Henan in his youth, but he left due to frustration and devoted himself to the study of medicine. All kinds of difficult and complicated diseases, both internal and external, were cured by his hands. After arriving in Shanghai, his reputation spread rapidly. A few years ago, a woman surnamed Qu from Guangdong had a growth in her abdomen. Shenyu cured it with needles. A wealthy overseas Chinese merchant surnamed Yuan suffered from stiff neck and back, and after visiting famous doctors in Germany and France without success, he heard of Shenyu's name and returned to China to show it to him. He was cured in forty-five days. His skills can be called miraculous. He is amiable and chivalrous, and he treats the diseases of others as if they were his own. Even if the poor come to him for treatment, he inquires attentively and does not care about money. He is unlike the famous doctors of today. Friends and relatives who come to him for help are always readily accommodated. He is dedicated to friendship and righteousness, even in the cold of winter and the heat of summer. He also founded the Yixue Huilian Society and published four kinds of books, all valuable medical works that benefit the world. Mr. Chu Lantang De Yi gave him a couplet: "The famous words of Jiushi are verified in the Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals, the divine techniques of needles and moxibustion are learned by the official Cang Gong Shenyu." This shows that he understands him. His medical residence has recently moved from the junction of Meibai Road and Ge Road to Heleli, Wuzhen Road, Xinzha Road. I am recording this here for those who suffer from the same diseases.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of the South Seas (53)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>There are black-headed cranes with red beaks, African black swans, wild cats, Chinese dogs, and several kinds of deer. The spotted deer females have no horns, and the males have horns. By and large, animals without horns tend to be female. This proves the general principle that I have invented that males are sexual and females are not or have less. I have tested the three principles of the French park director: (1) Males and females are generally not in competition; (2) Females compete with females for less; (3) Males compete with males with certainty. The park director deeply agreed. This can prove that today's world wars are just the mutual killing of males. The males agitate and the excuses are material issues and various problems. Do roosters compete only for bread? If it is for food, the mothers bear more responsibility. Why do they not compete? It can be proven that Marx's theory is flawed.</p>
<p>There is a yellow cat as big as a dog, European black rabbits, kangaroos, and white-spotted snakes. The fish is eight feet long and often opens its mouth to release heat. According to the Yuanjian Leihan, the raccoon is good at sleeping and does not wake up, so people say "raccoon sleep." Today, those who say "take a nap" are mistaken. Therefore, those who sleep long and do not wake up are all like raccoons. In the past, the American Elmerson wrote a book called "When Will the Japanese Wake Up?" Looking at this raccoon, I am even more convinced.</p>
<p>The French park director is a strange monk. He is skilled in martial arts, boxing, can write in four styles of calligraphy, and paints. Many people from various places seek his calligraphy. He has been running this park for ten years and has spent over ten thousand. Some people say, "Why does a monk need to do this?" But they do not know that this public figure uses a park as a six realms. A couplet is written on the rockery, saying, "It is good to live here, why not sit for a while? Life is like a dream, advise you not to be too busy." The door plaque says, "Heaven and Man Rejoice." The words "Subduing Dragons and Subduing Tigers" are written on both sides of the rockery. This shows its ambition. However, the South Seas business has not been good in recent years. The daily expenditure is twenty or thirty yuan, and the income is only ten yuan. I heard that in the past, the daily income was fifty yuan. Such academic and cultural institutions should be supported by society and the government. It must be known that the zoo is now the center of learning. Since Lamarck and Darwin, the resolution of social problems has focused on zoology. It sweeps away the fallacies of the era of divine power. Today, my research is based on the physiology of the two sexes and the statistics of war. The root of all evil is the male. It is not really a matter of materialism. It is a great relationship with zoology to explain the origin of sin. Moreover, today's monks are criticized by society for not doing anything. Master Fakong has both literary and martial arts skills and is doing his best for this world's academic achievements. Is he not a strange person in the Buddhist world and a glory of culture? In the park hangs his English medal for competition performance. Another couplet says, "Cranes have dreams of returning to the nest, clouds have no intention of leaving the mountains." You can see his ambition.</p>
<p>That evening, Mr. Dai Shuyuan hosted a banquet and invited reporters from various newspapers. However, few ordinary people have much knowledge of biology, so my three principles are not easy to truly understand.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (280)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears Stain, The Beauty's Heart is Broken; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, A Maiden's Soul Departs.</p>
<p>The wife became suspicious and recalled all sorts of clues. After that teahouse boy left, she instructed everyone in the household, "When the master comes home, you are not to say anything. You must not tell him that A'tu came." The servants and maids naturally obeyed the wife's orders, because the wife's authority was greater than the master's. Seeing the master being scolded by the wife, they dared not say a word. When the master returned home at twelve o'clock, everyone remained silent. Only the wife spoke, interrogating him like a judge in a court of law. The wife took a puff of her opium pipe and asked, "The ship was late today, wasn't it?" Zhang Yiqing said, "We hadn't even reached Nanjing when we encountered a dense fog. It wouldn't dissipate no matter how hard we tried. Our ship dared not venture into the fog, so we were anchored in the middle of the river for a whole day and night." At this, everyone in the family covered their mouths and chuckled. Even the pipe-lighter, A'bao, dared not give the master a wink, as the wife was watching her very closely. The wife smiled and said, "In that case, you were trapped by the fog." She paused for a moment and said, "Someone told me that they saw you in Shanghai yesterday." Yiqing was taken aback for a moment and quickly defended himself, "How could that be? I was still on the Yangtze River yesterday. Who saw me? Where? That's utter nonsense!" However, although he said this, he was a little flustered, because he had indeed been out yesterday, going to a money exchange on the back street and playing cards at a friend's house in the evening, not returning to his apartment until one o'clock. The wife was truly an excellent judge. She asked her questions calmly and methodically. She took another puff of her pipe and said, "Because the ship you were on arrived yesterday. Someone told me, so I said you returned yesterday." Zhang Yiqing thought, "So it was a sting." He then smiled and said, "I see. But you must know that I didn't return on the same ship. I returned on the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangkuan." As a shipping comprador, he was naturally familiar with which ships arrived on which days. At this, the pipe-lighter, A'bao, thought that this was a rather clever answer, but that he shouldn't reveal any more slip-ups. She was like a lawyer accompanying the defendant in court, unable to instruct him on his testimony, yet afraid that he would say something wrong. She was truly on tenterhooks for him. But the interrogator was truly skilled. She said, "Since you took that ship there, why didn't you return on the same ship?" Zhang Yiqing said, "There was a bill to be settled for me at the Hankou office. The manager asked me to stay for a day, so I had no choice but to stay." He thought that this sounded respectable and used the foreign manager to intimidate her, so there was nothing more to say. But he didn't know that he had confirmed to the interrogator that he had taken that ship there. The wife then asked, "That teahouse boy, A'tu, whom I recommended before, isn't he on that ship? Did you see him?" A'bao thought, "If he says he didn't see him, the situation can still be salvaged." But Zhang Yiqing wanted to ingratiate himself with his wife and said, "Yes, I saw him. That person is quite diligent."</p>

<h3>Gold Market Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Psychological Chaos and Abnormalities Abound: Yesterday, the 18th, the gold market was extremely volatile. Prices fluctuated rapidly, sometimes rising or falling by two or three taels. The overall trend was a sharp decline. Throughout the day, the price fluctuated by seven taels, leaving people anxious and uncertain. The 540-tael mark was breached. Foreign exchange rates also weakened, with quoted prices slightly higher by half a notch. In the morning, various firms showed an excess of supply over demand. Yuan Mao Yong, Zhi Feng Yong, Da Yong Da, and De Cheng were particularly eager to sell, while Fu Chang Yuan, Heng Sheng, Da Wan Xing, and Shun Li were among the buyers. Early in the morning, the market price appeared stable, and the silver market remained unmoved. Later, sellers became more aggressive, causing a sharp decline of over five taels, falling from above 41 taels to within 36 taels. At noon, exchange rates recovered slightly and eased, rising by about three taels. Subsequently, the market stabilized and then weakened again, with discrepancies among various firms. Suddenly, news emerged that the military situation might be resolved, preventing exchange rates from soaring. Upon hearing this news, major players in the market tended to sell off, especially foreign exchange, which became quite loose. Gold prices plummeted, falling drastically by six or seven taels and breaking the 40-tael mark, suddenly dropping to just over 35 taels. It finally closed at just above 36 taels.</p>
<p>Erratic and Unstable: The market was extremely unstable, fluctuating between hope and despair. At 9:00 AM, the November price opened at 541 taels, up slightly by five qian. However, large bars rose slightly by one-sixteenth. The silver price rose by one-half. Soon after, the market moved downward. Xin Heng and others were seen selling slightly. Then, sellers flooded the market, causing the price to fall by four or five taels to 36 taels and two or three qian. Later, the price rose by two taels as Mitsui of Taiwan absorbed forward British gold at 8 pence .0625 to .135. Also, Hua Bi and Feng sold near-term US dollars to HSBC at $40.03125, causing the price to rise to 38 taels and 1.2 qian. When the preliminary order was announced, rising by .125, the US dollar added 2.5 jiao, and Japanese gold was suppressed by .075, the price retreated to 6 taels and 4.5 qian. Later, it rose again as Taiwan bought December British gold at 8 pence .125. Banks mutually traded October US dollars at $40.04375. Macgregor also absorbed January British gold at 8 pence .125. Therefore, at 10:00 AM, the price rose to 39 and a half taels. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of one or two taels, but the underlying trend was downward as various parties sold off and the market weakened. By 11:00 AM, it was only 35 taels and 8 qian. After a while, a semblance of peace returned, mainly because banks still had an appetite for British gold, and small investors also rushed to buy at lower prices, so the price rose again to 39 taels and 4.5 qian. However, there was still fluctuation of one tael or so. At noon, it closed at 39 taels and 4 qian. Subsequently, the price continued to rise by a few qian. The quoted price was changed to 599 taels and 4 qian because Japanese gold was quoted down by .075, a discount of 61 to 62.3 taels. At noon, the discount was only about 60 taels.</p>
<p>Sharp Turn in the Situation, Continues to Fall by Four Taels: The market opened in the afternoon, adding one tael to 40 taels and 4 qian, a remnant of the noon close. This was followed by 2 taels and 1.2 qian, then about one tael, due to discrepancies in buying and selling. Around 2:30 PM, Fu Chang, Yuan Xing Yong, and others made purchases. Zhengjin absorbed British gold for the next month at 8 pence and there were rumors of internal cabinet turmoil in Japan, or a peaceful resolution, so people seemed to see auspicious signs. After 3:00 PM, the price rose to 42 taels and 6 qian. Suddenly, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, and others rushed to sell, and British gold and other currencies weakened. Banks sold November 8 pence, but Fu Chang and Sheng Da both scrambled to buy in order to cash out bars. Then, news suddenly emerged that the situation was turning sharply downward, so the knowledgeable became even more anxious and broke the 40-tael mark, suddenly falling to 35 taels and 3 qian after 4:00 PM. The downward trend was unstoppable. However, the market recovered by more than one tael at closing, ending at 36 taels and a half, continuing the previous day's decline of four taels. The highest price for the day was 41 taels and 6 qian, and the lowest was 35 taels and 3 qian, a difference of 7 taels and 3 qian. The quoted price was a discount of 60 taels to 57 taels, and finally 63 or 4 taels were recorded. The accounts for the month were 51 taels, the next month 43 taels, and November 39 taels. Replenishing water was 51 taels in the morning and 49 taels in the afternoon. Goods were 41 taels and 2 qian in the morning, 39 taels and 9 qian at noon, and 40 taels and 6 qian in the afternoon, closing at 36 taels and a half.</p>
<p>Busy Trading, More Selling than Buying: Most firms were offering to sell.</p>
<p>Yuan Cheng, Xin Heng, Yuan Kang Hu, and the goods firms sold their positions. Fu Chang, Cui Tai, Sheng Da, Shun Li, Wan Xing, Tai Heng Yuan, Yi Yu, and Yuan Heng all made purchases. Sen Chang Yong, Yuan Tai, Zhen Chang Xiang, and Tai Kang Run were both buying and selling. In the afternoon, Yuan Cheng, Yuan Cheng Yong, Wan Xing, Fu Chang, and Shun Li all bought. Yong Feng, Zhi Feng Yong, and Heng Xing had fluctuating transactions. Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Da, Yong Chun Fa Yong, and the goods firms mostly sold. There were also fluctuations in foreign exchange hedging, but there were more buyers than sellers. The Dalian gang collectively bought more than 2,000 bars but sold only 300 or 400 bars. The Guangdong gang had fluctuating transactions, with about 2,000 bars traded.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: The Yarn Market Under the Confrontation of Bulls and Bears</h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon. Currently, the bulls and bears are fiercely fighting. Factories are maintaining the 8 tael mark. However, the environment is still not good. Because banditry is rampant everywhere, actual sales are still difficult to prosper. Therefore, the Chaozhou gang is aggressively selling off when prices rise. It can be seen that both sides are competing fiercely. However, actual demand is clearer than yesterday. In the afternoon, the gold industry purchased and Ruida was mostly short, and the market atmosphere suddenly became tight. Therefore, prices rose by one tael for each month. The overall situation may stabilize. The future depends on demand for a turnaround.</p>
<p>Man-Made Standard Cotton Fell in the Morning and Rose in the Afternoon: The man-made standard cotton market opened with American cotton flat and weak. The market situation was still not good. The selling atmosphere was strong, and prices fell by two or three qian. The trend continued to fall for two or three rounds, resulting in falls of seven, eight, and nine qian. In the afternoon, the market rose sharply, and the situation became tense. It was said that there was news of peace, so retail investors echoed the purchase, and prices rose by 1 tael and 3 qian for each month. Total transactions for the day were 19,550 bales. Sen Kang sold 1,000 bales, Dafeng 1,200 bales, Gongtai 800 bales, Yichang 650 bales, Tianlong 900 bales, and the others 200 bales to 550 bales. Ruida bought 1,600 bales, Yiyu 1,450 bales, Hanyue 900 bales, Tianjiang 900 bales, Meiji 700 bales, and the others 350 bales to 800 bales. The closing price of man-made standard cotton is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Actual Sales Were Scarcer Than Yesterday: Actual yarn sales were less than yesterday. The statistics for purchases by various gangs for the whole day were 950 bales. Fellow merchants purchased 385 bales. The market was flat. Customer gangs from Sichuan purchased 305 bales, inland areas 40 bales, Xuzhou 55 bales, Shantou 280 bales, Niuzhuang 60 bales, Guangdong 95 bales, and miscellaneous gangs 115 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Sales Active, Market Stable</h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak in the morning and strong in the afternoon. The situation in the American cotton market was still flat. The easing of foreign exchange rates made the combined price of foreign cotton cheaper. Therefore, Shenxin Factory purchased 6,000 bales of Lumi Special American cotton at a price of 37 taels and 5 qian to 8 taels and 11 months for delivery to the factory. The Han gang sold off at rising prices. The cotton market should tend to be stable. However, the inland gangs, due to the poor harvest, purchased but did not sell and had a strong bullish mentality. In addition, leather factories, due to cotton yarn relations, purchased standard cotton at a limited price of 2 taels for the 11th and 12th months. Therefore, morale was slightly stable. Actual sales in the factory were slightly traded. However, Japanese factories remained quietly unmoved.</p>
<p>Han Cotton Rose After Falling: The Han cotton market opened with American cotton flat. The weather was clear, and retail investors sold off, and the market fell steadily. Prices fell by 1 qian and 5 fen for each month. In the afternoon, the yarn market rose sharply, and the cotton market led the rise by 1 qian and 5 fen to 2 qian. Total transactions for the day were 46,200 dan. Daji sold 3,300 dan, Yicheng 2,500 dan, Dafeng 1,600 dan, Maoji 1,400 dan, and the rest 1,100 to 1,200 dan. Changji bought 1,100 dan, Gongtai 3,900 dan, Hanfeng 1,500 dan, Ruida 2,500 dan, Tianchang 1,600 dan, Xiesheng 2,300 dan, and the rest 900 to 1,200 dan.

<h3>Overseas Cotton Yarn Prices Fluctuate</h3>

<h3>Grain: The Jing Rice Market in Hexia is Stable and the Xian Rice Market is Weak</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, ships from Luli came, and the remaining numbers sold well. High-quality broken Jing rice was still in short supply. Zhongguan had a slight large-volume sale, and all were finalized. Ordinary was still at 20 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao. Xixin Jing rice was increasingly scarce, and the market remained at 20 yuan and 5 jiao. Dongxin Jing rice was also still at 20 yuan. Xinyang Xian rice was weak as the weather turned clear and people tended to soften, and prices fell by 3 or 4 jiao. It must be especially high to open at 15 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao, and ordinary was about 15 yuan. Xin Kejian also fell by 2 or 3 jiao. Carloads arrived at the port and were sold one after another. The market was not prosperous, and the price was 14 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao. Medium quality was 13 yuan and a half. All the tips were declining, but Duzi Xian was priced at 16 yuan and a half to 17 yuan because of the shortage. The market for changed yuan was weak, and there were no gains or losses.</p>
<p>Hunan, Shanghai: There were only a few sources from Hexia. There was still no high-quality white broken rice. Ordinary goods in the market were also extremely scarce. Prices were stable. Xinjing was increasingly scarce, and the market still followed Zhabei and changed. Qingpu and other Xinxiang Jing were still at 20 yuan and a half. Xin Jian was slightly arriving at the port. Yangdu Jian also felt sluggish. Sales in the market were flat due to the clear weather. Prices were slightly different by 2 or 3 jiao. Baiyuan followed, and shipments were sold as they arrived. Luli production messages were still tight, so this cargo was still opened high at 19 yuan to 18 yuan, 7 or 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market is Weak and Lifeless</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices mostly tended to stabilize. Due to the slight fluctuations in foreign wheat quotations, short positions outside the industry were replenished with the market. Therefore, it seemed that the market had turned stable, but the environment felt secretly weak. After the market opened in the afternoon, near-term and long-term periods felt stable and sluggish. The main cause of the turbulence was the heavy decline in the city. The external exchange rate was gradually extended, as if to give a good and cost-effective order for foreign wheat. Therefore, large and small factories that had already started ordering foreign wheat also sold off one after another, causing people's hearts to be greatly weakened. There was a fall in the fourth customs level from November onwards. This situation was completely driven by foreign countries, and it is still uncertain whether it is optimistic that the exchange rate will lengthen later. As a result, this month fell 1.5 points compared to the previous day, October fell 1 point and 7 li and a half, November and December fell 1.5 points, January fell 2 points, and February fell 1.5 points.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market is Still Difficult to Advance</h3>
<p>Another Wave of Selling... The Flour Market Reports a Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the period wheat market opened in the morning, the market in each month tended to be stable. There was a situation where short positions were slightly offset due to the seemingly flat situation, and the market relied on it to hold. When it opened in the afternoon, a small factory was already short, and due to the lengthening of the exchange rate, another batch was sold off, and the fall in the flour market caused each month to be unstable. If the exchange rate changes again, the future is still looking small. As a result, this month fell 0.3 points compared to the previous day, October fell 1 point, November fell 0.3 points, December and January fell 1.2 points, and February fell 0.3 points. Each factory in the spot wheat market once again rejected each other, and the firm rejection of this type of factory seemed to be an opportunity. A total of 2,000 packages of Shandong, Yaowan, and Shashi wheat were opened in the city. The price was slightly lower than the previous day by 2 or 3 points, and Fuxin reluctantly ate it.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Wuxi Autumn Cocoon Production is Poor and of Poor Quality</h3>
<p>Only 20 to 30% Harvest... Drying Loss Requires 400 Jin</p>
<p>This year, the farmers in Wuxi townships were not weak in their autumn silkworm breeding, thanks to the promotion by government offices and silk merchants. However, before and after the big sleep, the weather suddenly changed, and the autumn rain did not stop. In addition, the weather was severe, resulting in the outbreak of silkworm diseases and extremely poor harvests. The total harvest was only 20 to 30%. Although a small number of scales were opened in various cocoon banks, the quality of the cocoons was exceptionally poor, and the drying loss required 400 jin.</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>Wan Yuan Xiang Embroidery Shop, located at the west end of Huajin Lane on Sanma Road, declares that this shop has devoted great effort to researching embroidery techniques. All drafts are meticulously created by famous calligraphers and painters. Hundreds of female workers in the Xiangzhong factory are well-trained. The embroidery work is quite capable of maintaining the original color of the draft. Recently, due to the raging red atmosphere in Changsha, a large number of embroidered goods have been shipped to Shanghai. Fine products abound, allowing people to choose and purchase, which is a great opportunity for happy birthdays and gift-giving. Please do not miss it.</p>
<p>Da Sheng Trading Company, located at No. 7 Ningbo Road, Shanghai, declares that the Xu's rotary mimeograph produced by the Zhengyuan Industrial Cooperative, managed by this company, has been widely praised and admired by all walks of life. The printing is convenient. The machine is made entirely of metal, so it is extremely sturdy and durable. The action is sensitive and the printing is clear. It can also print two or three colors or more at the same time. The price is lower than foreign goods, and the value is only 100 yuan. Various institutions, organizations, schools, and firms in this city and other places have adopted this machine, so buyers are extremely enthusiastic. In addition, this company has detailed instructions. A letter with four cents postage attached will be sent.</p>
<p>China Investment Company, located at No. 38 Avenue Edward VII, declares that this company is engaged in real estate construction business in this city. Now, in view of the fact that Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life gather, both good and bad, and that the issue of housing is very important to citizens, it has specially established a real estate rental department to promote social progress and improve the lives of the people. All citizens who want to rent a house and want to have good neighbors, and landlords who want to find good tenants can be introduced. It is now heard that there are a large number of clients entrusting both parties, and in the future, benefiting the society is not a small matter.</p>
<p>Yuxing Biscuit Company declares that this company has specially hired technicians who have studied in Europe and have rich experience to carefully produce various Western-style biscuits. They are crisp and delicious, and are very different from the ordinary biscuits used in the market. The taste is sweet without being greasy, and the quality is light without harming the spleen and stomach. Therefore, Western countries have tried to cater to the tastes of the Chinese people and have competed to sell and ship, stealing my money. Although this is a small matter, the outflow of rights and interests is as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Recently, Chinese people have become more aware and have set up factories to manufacture to meet domestic demand. However, Chinese people only know how to imitate without adding research. No wonder they are inferior to foreign goods. This company, in view of this, has exhausted several years of effort to refer to the mysteries of this field and obtained its good method. It has specially made various Western-style biscuits. Its products are not only different from ordinary biscuits, but also surpass imported products. The price is particularly low. All patriotic gentlemen can come and get them. The address is No. 140 Avenue Joffre, French Concession.</p>
<p>Rui Yuan Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop, located across from Zhejiang Road and Xiamen Road, declares that this shop will hold a grand sale and give away gifts for 28 days to celebrate the tenth anniversary of its founding on the 19th day of the ninth month of the national calendar. In addition, a discount department will be set up in this shop to implement a "buy one foot, get one yard free" policy to repay the elegant intentions of its patrons. The rest of the newly arrived goods have fresh and abundant patterns, and the prices are unusually cheap. Don't miss the good opportunity, don't miss it.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>Paris Grand Theater declares that this theater will from today screen Niao Fa Company's latest great production of 1930, "Desire Sea Love Sky". The film is starring Europe's most beautiful female star, Betty Amann, and the conflict between flesh and spirit, the male lead, Florelle, is a sad and gorgeous film that has shocked the world. The crazy and unrestrained parts are intoxicating and bone-eroding, the sad parts make people linger and want to cry, and the ending's sweet entanglement is very thought-provoking. Recently, it was simultaneously screened in various Shochiku theaters in Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, Japan, and lasted for a month.</p>
<p>Nanjing Road Flower World declares that since the opening of this world, all the performances have been excellent, so the tourists are quite crowded. The manager of this venue, Cheng Xiqing, and the assistant manager, Wang Keyang, in order to arouse the interest of tourists, specially ordered Da Yi Ban to rehearse this play, and instructed Xiaofeng Society to compile and perform a new play of current affairs, "The Death of the Actress". They are currently rushing to prepare the costumes and scenery, etc., and will be able to start performing soon. It is also scheduled that starting this Friday, the 19th, tickets will be sold for one dime to show preferential treatment to customers.</p>

The female lead has hired Xu Suzhen.</p>
<h3>Publishing News</h3>
<p>The United Bookstore on Fourth Horse Road declares that the books published by this store on journalism are all famous works at home and abroad, and are not only suitable as textbooks for journalism departments in universities, but also must-reads for those engaged in journalism and scholars who study journalism. For example, the newly published "History of Chinese Journalism" is a meticulous work by Huang Tianpeng, praised by the Japanese as a representative work of the Chinese journalism circle. It has been adopted as a textbook by the Journalism Department of Fudan University and the Journalism Department of Yenching University. Another example is "Collection of Famous Essays on Journalism", which was originally designated as a reference book by various schools. Due to the poor content of the first edition, it has been re-selected and revised to a 25-format book, and the price is still sold for one yuan. Another example is "Business Management of Journalism", which is Mr. Wu Dingjiu's lecture at Peking University, which focuses on practice and does not make empty talk. "An Outline of Journalism" is a masterpiece by the Japanese Chu Ren Guan, which analyzes journalism in great detail. In addition, "An Outline of Journalism" by Xu Shihuang, a senior journalist, will also be published by this store and will be available early next month.</p>
