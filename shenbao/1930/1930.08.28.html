<p>時評</p>
<h3>秘魯之革命</h3>
<p>今日秘魯之革命。雖名爲推翻狄克推多制。而實仍軍人之自奪政權。仍恐未能達秘人澈底之目的也。</p>
<p>以秘魯歷來之政象言。名爲濱臨太平洋之一共和國。然政權恒操於軍人手中。至一九一九年拉圭亞乘國内政變。取得總统統職權後。頒布憲法。規定社會立法諸制。表面固已脫離軍人專政。但拉氏爲總統後。事事專斷不旋踵又成爲獨裁政治。秘人反抗。則更欲組織新軍人内閣。以爲如此則可以遏抑民氣。而不知益以增民氣之激昻。此革命之所以爆發也。然爲反對拉氏之新軍人内閣而革命。而革命之領袖。仍爲軍人。革命之後。仍由邦士將軍組織軍政府。則此軍政府。安知將來不即變爲軍人内閣耶。此其所以未澈底也。</p>
<p>以秘魯革命運動之歷史言。中南美民族之運動。起於學生。一九一八年之所謂大學革命所謂聯合運動。秘學生亦頗盡力。惟當時之所謂革命。目的在反對美帝國主義之壓迫。必達此最後目的。而後謂之革命成功。乃令日之革命運動。雖有多數學生參加然領導之者仍爲軍人革命之最後目的。雖爲反美。然今日之革命。則仍爲國内之政爭。今日柏林電稱。秘魯國民黨秘書在德宣言。此次革命成功。可視爲脫離美國勢力重獲自由途徑上之一大進步。其言母乃過誇。蓋以秘魯目前情形觀之。此次之革命。仍如前數次之政變軍人自相爭奪。多一番紛擾而已。其去澈底蓋甚遠也。</p>

<h3>誌黎仲實先烈</h3>
<p>— 胥梵</p>
<p>黎先生仲實。中山産。民黨健將也。智勇忠實。膽略逾恒。追隨總理多年。擘畫參贊。與先烈廖仲凱同工。先生從事革命工作。忠勇勤奮。不計利祿。故先生之名未彰。辛亥春。偕胡漢民廖仲凱諸同志。微服潛居北平。乘隙狙擊載惇。隻身殺仇。奮不顧身、旋以寡不敵衆。未遂大志。而先生卒獲自衛出平者。迺智能過人也。民十之秋。先生公幹蒞滬。會滬上時疫盛行。以勞瘁過度。染疾寢寓。特先生素忌藥石。家人勸進罔應。喟然歎曰。「予奔走半生。革命未成。大丈夫生死有數。人食五穀。誰能不病。焉賴斯草木爲哉。」一時親友畢集。勸進西藥。先生堅不納。予以友誼故。越日奔滬省視。而先生竟長逝矣。時軍閥當道。大局未定。遂葬於萬國公墓焉。余昨道經墓側。覩先生墓塜靑靑。爲之低徊靡已。噫。先生因公殞命。事績不亞於諸烈。而英名迄未表彰。殆天喪斯文耶。抑追悼尙非其時耶。撫今思昔。能不悵然。略誌數語。聊供革命史料之一助。</p>
<h3>哭謝介子</h3>

<p>謝氏二難、公展介子。蜚聲海上已久不佞獲與訂交。則始於戊辰之秋。介子來錫養病梅園時。而實以兩詞爲之介。蓋神交於數載前矣。先是不佞刋兩詞於自由談。蘭陵菊社賞菊之作也、賢昆仲見而亟賞之。錄稿徧訪其人。故介子至錫。一見如平生歡。有由然也。西神先生五湖秋泛記中。盛稱此一叚文字因緣。至以隨園與紅雪樓主故事相擬焉。在不佞窮途知己之感。則不啻北海之知豫州也。介子居梅園半載。喜吟詠。不時過從。或置酒相招。即景聊句。嘗以唱酬諸作。輯爲「太湖吟嘯錄」一書。春秋佳日。屢與公展招致海上書畫家。及報界名流如李浩然周瘦鵑諸子　先後遊錫。一時觴詠之盛。具見報章紀載。去歲别後。久不相見。江雲渭樹。正切相思。而今春上已。介子忽翩然蒞止。遂相與修禊梅園。故人無恙。舊地重遊。喜可知也。不侫輙爲文以紀之。嗚呼。孰知此一度重逢。遂爲千秋永訣期耶。月初不佞以事覊鄉。邇日返錫。噩耗傳來。驚魂欲絶。嘔心長吉。遽赴修文。遠道巨卿。慚負死友。痛逝自念。情何以堪。况復蔡女猶雛。難承父業。徐妻正少。作祭夫文。魂兮有知。亦當不暝。人間哀史。有逾此耶。而公展情深手足。其哀更可想見也因爲二詩以哭之曰。依稀二陸播聲華。小謝清才海上誇。詩酒偏交名下士。湖山曾寄病中家。仲宣體弱身還客。長吉心杜血作花。悽絶俊遊成隔世。黄壚舊雨感天涯。兩字憐才感最深。故交回溯痛人琴。雙聲菊詠邀靑眼。萬樹梅花結素心。元度數過猶惜别。鍾期一去少知音。蓉湖有客招魂處。雪涕秋風託苦吟。</p>
<h3>奇異之植物</h3>
<p>— 瘦羊</p>
<p>余客陳港。時近三月。前日歸來。内子告以中表戚陳彬如家。於廢曆四月間。其所居後園内假山石旁。生有植物一種。形似毛莨。高約四尺許。葉長而闊。邊緣有齒。其色赭。葉腋開花。或紫或白。上有斑點。花瓣重複。各分七裂。其已開之花。與含苞之蕊。均下墜如瓔珞。微風吹拂。似彩蝶之淺舞。惟該花莖際。生有黄鬚。且有極濃烈之異香。嗅之鼻間。不能即散。戚人曾邀有愛花癖者。前往觀賞。然見者咸弗能識該花之何名。斯眞奇異之植物也。爰濡筆記之。以供海内植物家之研究。</p>

<p>中華佛徒旅行團由北平至滬。小駐月餘。今出發在即。二十四上午十二時。由友聲旅行團。東方圖書出版社。及世界佛敎居士林三團體公宴於滬西赫德路覺園。出席者除佛徒旅行團領團體參。副領團悲觀。并由滬新近加入之湛然。明慧。二僧外。有新自南洋來而擬乘自由游歷世界之魏覺鐘君。與甫由印度抵滬以環游全球爲宗旨之楊宇振君。天南地北。相見殊非易易。殆所謂佛法有緣歟。已而友聲代表劉玉麒·宋沛道·倪汝平。及佛敎居士林代表法舫。曁來賓田楚僑·林烈敷諸君。先後接踵而至。於是咸集池心凉亭下攝影。返佛敎會大殿上入座進茶。賓主計十五人。分爲二席。素筵旣上。會式始開。（一）三團體公推黄警頑君代表致辭。略謂「佛徒在現代幾被視爲腐化份子。希望佛徒團與現代僧人改革之。并望該團貫澈始終。不可遇難而退。」復舉古今來游歷家之事實。勉勵有加（二）悲觀答詞。除代表該團答謝感激之意外。爲述由北平出發之情形。「吾團五人於七月三十日由北平出發。八月二日到天津。民言日新及大公報等。均與滬地各報有同樣的表示。民言日報謂吾團爲「靑年佛徒的新活動。」吾團興奮異常。同時要感謝贊助吾團者之諸君。即有反對吾團者。亦當感謝。蓋能增益吾輩堅忍之志也。吾輩此行。當將釋迦牟尼的慈悲觀來發揚光大。并將在異國所得佛的證物來貢獻與佛界。方不負三團體與諸君子之盛情。」（三）林烈敷先生演說。謂「余非佛徒。亦未嘗研究佛學。然余覺當今無眞和尙、惟有古代唐玄奘爲眞和尙。余曾游天山南北各路。冰天雪地。巉巖峭壁。處處令人寒心。可見玄奘當時以孤孑一身往印度取經而歸國譒譯之不易。而其人爲可敬仰也。」又云「深望佛徒旅行團諸上人。」面學佛。一面工作。一面出家。一面入世而勞動。須以科學化之態度而改革佛敎」云云。餘如楊宇振魏覺鐘君等。均有懇切之演辭。惜二君久處南洋。率操粤語。殊不易解。但大意布望該團勿徒事空談。須躬行實踐。并說明伊等游歷之經騐與旨趣。宴畢各團體各名人人相繼題簽。釋體參取出由北平至滬之報宣傳物等。任人觀覽。中有太虚大師在普陀避暑地寄書誥誡云。「以堅忍之力。任勞苦之行。必須百折不回。以貫澈其目的。待有實在成績表現。則自得人之信佩。不可事前空發夸言。而遇難輒退。是爲切要。」衆賓觀覽之餘。無不嘆爲該團之第二佛旨。望其恪守也。簽名後。法舫上人引導隨喜於晴翠幽靜之覺園。由東方胡伯洲君復攝影多張而散。</p>
<h3>最近德國政潮之解剖（下）</h3>
<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>議議解散宣讀後。隨即開始活躍之德國選舉運動。亦可爲有興味之研究。布律寗内閣解散國會後。曾發出一告德意志民衆書。其中曾提出一問題。九月十四選舉時。選民當予以答復。此問題即「爲維持財政秩序計。爲維持德意志經濟計。爲維持一切社會事業計。政府所認爲必要之舉。德意志民衆願予以拒絶乎」。無論增稅案是否必要。但事關增稅。人民常感切膚之痛。故政府所提出之問題。選舉時得到滿意之答覆與否。實難預料·且與政府處反對地位之左派與右派。勢必利用此問題。對於民衆大施其宣傳手腕。反動政黨如喜特到（Hitler）所領導之種族派及囂震柏之國家主義派等。亦將乘機待變。圖於絶望之境地造成一種有利於本黨之新動向。此外共産黨亦必利用此由經濟事變所引起之普遍的不安。及由失業釀成之多數工人之困苦等。而有所活動。至社會民主黨則在選民前處唯一較優之地位。然欲獲得較一九二九年五月更大之勝利。亦爲難事。其最不利者乃處此極左與極右兩大潮流之中無數小政黨。如民主黨。天主敎黨。平民黨並軟化之國家主義派等。大有被吞減與被淘汰之虞。</p>
<p>現在德國政局尙有一引人注意之事。即將於九月十四日舉行之選舉對於興登堡總統之利害是也。如布律寗内閣之臨時成立。如「鐵兜」事件之干與。如應用憲法四十八條規定頒佈新稅律。最後如解散國會以維持在國會兩次失敗之布律寗内閣等。興登堡總統實親自參與政戰。假使九月十四日選舉之結果不利於政府。則興登堡總統以後之地位當深感困難。而政變將開展至何程度。任誰均不敢預料。現在吾人所急欲知者即德國人民以後向左乎。抑向右乎。抑將任此混亂之政局再繼續一時乎。此時無論何人殆均痛感前外長斯特斯曼（Gustav　Stresemann）之死。對於德國損失之巨。歐戰以後能支撑危局。使德民出水火而登袵席者。惟斯氏一人而已。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二六四）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　是誰種福無意得鑽環　惟此因緣有心歌金縷</p>
<p>懺儂道。昨天本來約了你二少來吃夜飯。今天我們家裏的弟弟。恰巧送了兩簍蟹來。所以特爲呌賬房先生寫了一張請客條子。送到你報館裏。你收到了嗎。左詩晨道。收到。從前我記得每逢湖蟹上市。都是你老子親自送來的。懺儂道。吾父親在三年前。已經老死的了。家裏就剩一個晚娘。兄弟也是過房得來的。我現在是六親無靠。孑然一身。那時便吩咐那個蘆壚人道。阿姨。你去揀蟹。醋薑碟子。預備好了没看。雌雄對搭。二少你吃十隻　了嗎。我們那裏的陽澄清水大蟹。每斤只有兩隻呢。左詩晨道。這樣的大蟹。十隻是吃不下的。至多是吃四隻。懺儂道。不彀。不彀。。那末煑八隻吧。前天聽得個客人說。有個前清做藩台李大。他能一口氣吃一百隻蟹。人家稱他爲李百蟹。他們蟹量可以算得大了。怎麽你吃十隻蟹也吃不下呢。左詩晨道。是的。我也聽人說過。說那位李梅庵先生能吃百蟹。連他的夫人。也能吃二十幾隻蟹咧。但也只是耳聞。不是目覩。也未敢信以爲眞。大概至少幾十蟹可以吃的。但也看蟹之大小。不能概而論。像你們這裏的大蟹。恐怕雖以李百蟹。也没那樣大量呢。停了一回兒。一個大水晶盤子。熱騰騰的送上一大盤鮮紅的螃蟹來。左詩晨向懺儂道。你何妨也一同來吃呢。懺儂道。我肚子不好·不敢吃·我來帮你剝吧。一面又呌人去倒了一玻璃杯的白蘭地。在持螯飲酒的當兒。左詩晨便慢慢的問起伊爲什麽出來的因由。懺儂歎了一口氣道。俗語說得好。「寗可做一隻鳥。弗要做人家一小。」做人家的七大八。總歸弗是生意經。說來話長。讓我慢慢的告訴你吧。我了這個苦頭。現在立志不嫁人了。左詩晨道。不嫁人怎樣呢。我勸你趁此刻年紀還不能算老。嫁一個老實至誠的人。古人詩上說的。「勸君莫惜金縷衣。勸君惜取少年時。」譬如一件怎樣講究的衣服便是破了。重新再做一件。也是容易的事。只是人的靑春。一去不復再來。韶光一瞥。轉瞬即逝。往往有許多人。少年時蹉跎過去。及至回頭。已傷老大。可謂少年不努力。老大徒傷悲。就是這個意思。妓院裏的歲月。自何意味。正是</p>

<p>進退毫無步驟　昨二十七日標金變化、仍屬徬徨、忽進忽退、步趣岐嶇、終日共計十兩之迴顧、惟稍見挫、同業態度悄恍、至於匯票不甚懸殊、掛牌已縮去半檔、而檯而上各經紀人時有出納、然無毫數、自前市初則萎軟、互有三四兩起落、銀價略低、不爲所動、往後買方見動、匯票似挺、於是欣欣向榮、茲由五百六十一二兩轟至七十一兩、無如資者接踵而起、復已轉替、但市况瓢泊未已、迫後市買賣益稀少、適值星期三、匯票向例乏市、致處庸碌之狀、厥後以在六十五兩之内、大條銀均回縮十六分之三、銀價低落二分之一、</p>

<h3>明晨市民大會</h3>
<p>剷共討逆祝捷</p>
<p>本市市民、因中央軍克復濟南、討逆節節勝利、閻馮汪三逆、行將消滅、實有慶祝必要、同時又因三逆唆使共産黨、於湘贛兩省、殺人放火、演成空前未有之慘刦、</p>
<h3>討逆剷共祝捷</h3>
<p>在國民革命軍統一全國中央準備開始訓政的時候、忽然有閻馮軍閥的叛變　這眞是一件使我們痛心疾首的事情、自從他們叛變後、西北人民、陷於水深火熱之中、痛苦萬分、自從他們叛變後、舉國騷然、我們的訓政工作、就無從進行、他們是黨國的罪人　他們是革命過程中的一羣妖魔我們要奠黨國於磐石之安、要使革命事業不半途而廢、我們首先就應蕭清他們、尤其是他們的大頭目、這一次叛變中的主動者、閻錫山馮玉祥汪精衛三逆、他們三個人是狼狽爲奸、他們的主義是叛黨禍國主義、他們嘴裡、雖然是說着、「禮讓禮讓」、但他們儘是在巧取豪奪、賣黨賣國他們雖然是整天在喊着、「一切利益歸於民」、但是實際呢、苛捐暴稅、多如牛毛、在他們統治下的同胞敢怒而不敢言　都在萬分熱忱的企望着我們中央軍的到來、最近、他們又組織所謂擴大會議了言論荒謬、行動乖張　假革命之名、行賣國賣黨之實、其人格之卑鄙、手段之齷齪、已達極點、綜其罪惡、「</p>
<p>難以罊述、同胞們、「擒賊先擒王、」他們、三個人是這一次叛變中的主動者、是現在西北逆軍中的大頭目、倘若没有他們三個喪心病狂寡鮮廉恥的人、這一次叛變决不會爆發、所以對於他們三個人、我們應夙夜匪懈的首先的予以討伐、從前晋朝有一個呌周處的、曾經除過三害、我們現在應該起來、鏟除革命過程中的三害、除了討逆以外我們現在的第二步的工作、就是剷共、共産的不適合於中國這是誰都知道的了、因爲中國現在根本没有大資産階級産業落後的國家、絲毫没有實行共産之可能、但是現在却有許多盲目的靑年、没有認識這一點、却跟着無祖國的蘇維埃政府亂喊亂跑、他們拿了他們主人的錢、到他們本國來拚命搗亂辦雜誌、發傳單、無所不至以冀淆辭一般靑年農工的視聽、起而作破壞黨國殘殺民衆的工作、最近更變本加厲、乘本黨討伐叛逆的時候實行暴動這一次長沙的叛變　和南昌社會局長共産黨員熊國華陰謀的暴露、就是一個很旣顯的例子、長此以後、危險萬分、瞻念前途、不寒而慄同胞們、起來吧、爲黨國前途着想、爲你們本身的幸福着想你們是不能再和他們講妥協了、倘若你們的血還没有冷的話、倘若你們是願意做一個熱血男兒的話你們就應毫不猶豫的起來剷除他們「屏諸四夷、不與同中國、」魔鬼遇了陽光　終究是要消滅的冰山到了春天、終究是會融化的　有主義的軍隊、遇到了烏合之衆、終究是會高唱「凱旋之歌」的、現在我們堂堂之旗、正正之陣的名正言順的革命軍隊、已經是在預備進凱旋之門了、據最近確實的消息泰安已經是克復、濟南的敵軍、已經是剷除殆盡、長沙的共産黨、也已經是聞風遠近　、同時津浦綫隴海綫又獲得了偉大的勝利、轟動一時的擴大會議現在已經到了廻光反照的時期了、叛逆者内部衝突　更是非常激烈、閻馮汪三逆都是在同床異夢的各執一是年罷、他們的崩潰是不成問題的了、他們自已的墳墓早已掘成而準備入墓了　在這酷烈的暑天、前方的健兒都在拚命的殺賊、同胞們、我們在後方、應該團結一致的作他們的後盾、起來我們高呼</p>
<p>打倒叛黨禍國的汪精衛、打倒殘民以逞的閻錫山、打倒賣國殃民的馮玉祥剷除殺人放火的中國共産黨、中國共産黨是民衆唯一的敵人　肅清欺騙農工殘殺民衆的中國共産黨、慰勞前方勞苦功高的討逆將士、慶祝前方討逆將士勝利、中國國民黨萬歲、國民革命成功萬歲、中華民國萬歲</p>

<h3>馬路新見聞</h3>
<p>引人注目截髮旗袍之妙齡密司</p>
<p>西門一帶及南京路北四川路各處，截髮旗袍之妙齡密司，來往如梭，曾見不少密司之旗袍，其衣料異常新奇，質地或白或淺湖色，或橘黄，均有别緻之印花·粗看或悮爲外國貨，殊不知乃是眞正老牌國貨，即係三友實業社之美術自由布·潔緻光滑之質地，加以奇妙别緻之印花，故甚爲美觀，現代吾國有思想之新女子，已大都愛用國貨，此種新出品進步衣料，自屬熱受女界之歡迎·</p>
<h3>大可敬佩西裝革履之翩翩少年</h3>
<p>過去所見之西裝少年，其衣料盡屬外貨·現在三友社有「二一二」軟自由呢出品以來，國貨西裝因之盛行，故馬路上所見，已不一而足，一向以爲愛國救國都屬空談，詎知一有合式之工具，人人樂願實行·將來推而廣之，舶來品西裝，自能天天减少，</p>
<p>··························</p>
<p>三友實業社門市部郵售部在上海南京路浙江路東，國曆八月二十日起大减價廿一天，二樓之布疋部浴衣部，三樓之服裝部被單等部，士女如雲，異常熱閙，此種好現象，自爲一般所快慰·特２４乙４８</p>

<p>一千六百三十一包</p>
<p>首批湘米到滬　八月二十二日、湘米開禁後、首批裝出者由日輪從長沙運到漢口、即於二十三日、轉長江班内日本船載來上海、昨日已裝到者、計一千六百三十一包、業在本埠起卸、二三批出境湘米、因發生米捐問題、已被阻滯、一時尙難運到、</p>
<p>湘商續催裝貨　長沙商市、因刦後衰敗、亟待振興、各客家電滬購辦大批貨入湘、供應市民需求、太古且派湘潭輪、直放湖南、滿運貨品前去、正擬出口、忽奉湘商電報、囑令緩開、免生危險、迨至昨日、長沙帮又發急電來上海、催促該貨從速運去、昨由客家通告太古、准定明晨命湘潭輪、載送該貨入湘、</p>
<h3>絲廠業常委王曉籟談</h3>
<p>日繭來華問題</p>
<p>存繭不敷江浙繅絲原料之用</p>
<p>但採用日繭建議亦難成事實</p>
<p>日繭來華、對於我國蠶桑事業、影響甚鉅、已引起實業家之注意、市商會方面、亦接到嘉興商總會委員顧速明提議、主張設法阻止、該會將提出常務會議討論、新聲社記者、昨爲此事、特往訪市商會主席兼絲廠同業公會常務委員王曉籟、詢以此事之眞相、據王君發表談話云、中國以農立國、而蠶　之利、亦所著稱、但本年米旣歉收、繭亦告荒、所惜吾國對於統計一事、向鮮注意、以致究竟全國産繭若干、絲廠需用繭量若干、均未能舉出確數、因此事前旣無調劑預防之法、屆時遂有臨渴掘并之慮、其實産繭統計、並不甚難、即就政府所收繭捐一項推算、亦可得一大概、絲廠　繭、則可責成江浙皖絲廠業總公所塡報、如此、則華繭果供本國廠用而有餘、仍可輸出國外、如僅足數用、或竟缺乏、亦可禁止輸出、或研究其缺乏之原因　設法補救、今年春間、日本絲商、亦曾來華購繭運日、約有二千担之譜、至目前存繭、則就江浙兩省車數統計連餘繭併計在内、亦不敷供巢絲原料一年之用、以上海一埠論、現有絲廠一百零八家、職工總數當在十萬以上、果因缺繭停車、則工人生計、必將因而發生影響、因此廠商方面、乃有進購日繭之建議、惟此項建議、仍未能成爲事實、其原因有三、（一）日繭價值、每担須日金二百元、目前日匯昂貴、約合華幣三百兩、加以繅絲折耗、最佳之繭部三百斤、次者四百斤、即此計算、繭價已合一千二百兩之數、兩加以繅工一二百兩、使成本太貴、絲廠或且有虧蝕之憂、（二）日繭必須經煮繭機蒸煮、方可適用、但中國絲廠有此項設備者極少、大約僅佔絲廠總數十分之一、因此機械不同、不能合用（三）繅絲條紋、在十三十五以下者爲細絲、十三十五以上者爲粗絲、日繭繅絲、只能繅到十六十八、尙不能至十三十五之數、遵論十三十五以下矣、以上三種原因、故採購日繭建議、終仍擱置、除曾有樣繭數十斤運滬外、並無大批進口之事、前報載某日輪運進若干包云云、查均非事實、但國人能注意及此、亦爲實業界之好現象、如本國對於農産物品、能積極提倡、增加産量、則非特日繭不能進口、即美麥印棉及西貢米、亦可希望其絶跡也云云、</p>
<h3>蘇杭長途電話</h3>
<p>九月一日開始通話</p>
<p>大陸社云、蘇杭長途電話、通話問題、近經浙江江蘇兩電話局商訂通話合同後、現正籌備一切所有話費、雙方各收三分之一之轉綫費、餘則概歸本局收入、現先行通話各地、計爲蘇州·黎里·盛澤·震澤·五處、准九月一日正式開始通話、至其話費價目、日内印刷完竣、即可公佈云、</p>
<h3>金利源案</h3>
<p>前途未許樂觀</p>
<p>法方公斷人態度極强硬</p>
<p>其要求軼出公斷範圍外</p>
<p>招商局金利源碼頭案、連日交涉結果、法總領甘格林態度、雖表示極佳、然三德堂公斷人雅米納態度、則極强硬、頗欲堅持執行廢約、完全違反公斷之本意、新聲社記者、昨向某處採得確實消息、分誌於下</p>
<h3>雅米納意見　當三德堂决定公斷</h3>
<p>人後、我方公斷人高朔律師、即往訪雅米納、據其表示、仍不能脫離法律解决、要求高律師擬一意見書送法公廨、高律師允考慮、當即要求雅米納先行將渠之意見書交閱、現聞於二十五日晚、已送至高律師公館、據其意見、分三點、（一）提存三德堂春夏兩季收得招商局之租金一萬二千兩、（二）限招商局於本年八月底交還碼頭及地産建築物、（三）津貼招商局棧房舊料費用六千兩、完全以廢約執行辦法之公斷人自居、</p>
<h3>高朔訪甘　高朔律師、以接到雅米</h3>
<p>納意見書後、以其完全違反法總領之意志、定今晨再訪甘總領、積極交涉、以備進行公斷、</p>
<h3>原約規定　一九一六年、招商局與</h3>
<p>三德堂續約合同第十一條、一兩造對於本合同之解釋及履行、如有爭議、應提付公斷人二人、由兩造各選一人、公斷人間有爭議、應由兩公斷人選定第三者公斷人一人、有完全裁定之權、並拘束兩造當事人、不得再向法院訴請更爲裁斷、公斷費由敗訴之一造負擔、</p>
<h3>陳希曾辭職後</h3>
<p>國府尙在懇切挽留中</p>
<p>否則畀陳以相當位置</p>
<p>新任招商局總辦陳希曾、因招商局經費問題、無法解决、由京返滬後、辭意更爲堅决、復因滬電報局長職、交部已另委宋述樵繼任、陳氏連日囑各科趕辦文代、昨晨忽怱怱至電報局結束一切、下午、即未到局辦公、聞新局長接事日期、尙未决定、國府對陳辭去招商局事、亦正在懇切挽留中、倘果無法挽回、惟有再請交王物色替人、而另畀陳以相當位置、</p>
<h3>蔡培昨晚晋京</h3>
<p>請示局務</p>
<p>招商局代理總辦蔡培、以新任陳希曾迄未到任、局務進行困難、於昨晚乘十一時夜快車入京、向王伯羣部長請示、並促新總辦到局視事、又聞蔡氏於昨日委任前宜昌關監督九江交涉員毛昌嗣在秘書處辦事、帮同高朔律師、辦理金利源碼頭案</p>
<h3>虞洽卿昨晚晉京</h3>
<p>討論招商局各問題</p>
<p>虞洽卿爲招商局問題、應國府當局電召、昨晚、十一時乘車、晉京洽商一切、代理總辦蔡培、亦偕同前往、對於人選及財政等項、或可有一解决辦法也、</p>

<p>旅滬湘人、近以湘省共黨暴行未已、南望烽烟、危慮萬分、特於昨日上午十時、假亞洲旅社、舉行緊急會議、當决議要案如下、（一）推舉沈陳易·李張辜等、代表本會、即請求當局、速派勁旅痛剿、以救湘省三千萬人民、（二）繼續通電各省湘人、一致參加救湘運動、（三）發行共黨禍湘十日記、請各方供給材料、（寄湖南會館轉交）彚編小册、分發全國、以廣反共宣傳、（四）致函旅滬湖南會館提欵應用、（五）向各方籌集用欵、（六）對湘省黨政問題、詳實確定治標治本主張、交請願代表提出、（七）主張從速整理湘省黨政機關及懲辦湘主席何鍵、省黨委省府委等、以息衆憤、（八）聯絡旅京湘人一致行動、</p>
<h3>市當局</h3>
<p>提倡國貨不遺餘力</p>
<p>十月初將舉行三屆國貨運動</p>
<p>展覽演講以外並有時裝大會</p>
<p>本市工商業、受金貴銀賤影響、營業日漸衰落、各界集議救濟辦法、咸以提倡國貨爲唯一方法、並認此時提倡、爲適當機會、市政府亦有鑒於此、特於上月中、訂定提倡國貨使用實施辦法、通令所屬、一體遵照等情、業誌前報、兹悉市社會局、即根據是項辦法、擬於十月初、舉行本市第三屆國貨運動大會、已呈准市府核撥籌備經費、查本市曾於十七·十八·兩年、已先後舉行、此項運動、收效甚佳、聞本屆尙須擴大宣傳、其辦法於展覽演講游藝以外、更舉行國貨時裝大會、以增觀感、</p>
<p>諒屆時必有一番盛况也、</p>

<h3>美孚行華職員</h3>
<p>周讓三被綁即脫險</p>
<p>綁匪刦車馳往虹橋路</p>
<p>將肉票藏荒野地窟内</p>
<p>三小時内捕房即破案</p>
<p>格斃一匪生擒三匪徒</p>
<p>美孚行華職員甬人周讓三、昨晨八時廿分左右、左赫德路寓所衖口、被匪綁去、事聞於靜安寺路捕房、立派中西探捕四出兜捕、卒於上午十時左右、在虹橋路遇到匪車、截住去路、將駕車之綁匪捉獲、訊明藏票所在、按址馳往虹橋路飛機塲附近、在地窟内將肉票救出、當塲格斃一匪、生擒一匪工其後又在大通路拘獲同黨男女兩人、計是案發生以至破獲、爲時不過三小時、靜安寺捕房破案神速、深可嘉尙、而周之脫險尤爲幸運也、</p>
<h3>綁匪預伏衖口　周讓三任職於美</h3>
<p>孚行銷售部、已有廿年之久、頗爲行主所器重、家住赫德路安慶坊一千三百六十號、邇因業務紛繁、由行爲備汽車一輛、照會爲二零三一號、以資代步、燃料所需、亦概由美孚供給、周晨夕駕車外出、乃爲綁匪所垂涎、設計綁架、實則其家道亦殊平庸耳、昨晨八時半未屆、周命車夫備車候發、停於安慶坊門口、孰知此時已有綁匪三人、預伏衖口、見周自寓所外出、一匪出槍恫嚇車夫、不得聲張、餘匪即上前將周架入二零三一號車中、</p>
<h3>肉票戴黑眼鐘　綁匪均執手槍、</h3>
<p>綁得周讓三後、即指揮周之車夫、向西馳去、行至膠州路附近、將車夫推下、由匪代爲司機、此時周枯坐車中、左右有匪挾制、不得動彈、而匪則將其外衣卸去、並爲之戴上墨晶眼鏡、以防默識去途、周當告以家境甚屬平常、華服車馬不過外表而已、此次有勞諸位、恐係弄錯誤綁、心實不安、匪聆言不語、惟將目鏡爲之除下</p>
<h3>捕房得訊兜捕　此案發生地點與</h3>
<p>靜安寺捕房相隔不遠、故事出後片刻、該捕房巳得訊、由西捕頭安德惠率領中西探員四出搜捕、至十時左右、安捕頭特駕汽車在滬西大西路虹橋路等一帶跴緝、</p>
<p>此時匪車早抵目的地、將肉票藏於虹橋飛機塲附近荒地中地窟内、其初、匪等駕二零三一號汽車、經過虹橋路飛機塲時、意欲開駛進内、惟遙見有兵士兩人竚立塲外、乃又轉車折回别處馳去、</p>
<h3>地窟中藏肉票　此車馳至荒野中</h3>
<p>地窟旁、即戞然而止、諸匪引出肉票、同步入窟、其中祗可容立數人、甚爲湫隘、地面蓋有鉛皮、故不易爲人窺見、周至此、向匪和言苦勸、告以從善、必得好報、正在言談間、忽一匪遙指遠處汽車、謂事敗矣、有捕來緝也、匪等聆言大駭、急謀兎脫之法、</p>
<h3>當塲格斃一匪　蓋西捕頭安德惠</h3>
<p>之車、馳至虹橋路時、瞥見有空車一輛、迎面馳來、視其號數赫然爲二零三一號、因急斜轉車頭、攔住來車、駕車之匪徒、立即就擒、帶回捕房、研審之下吐出藏票在虹橋路飛機塲附近、是以西捕頭即率領全體中西探捕馳往該處巡察、果得藏票所在、匪見捕來、開槍抵拒、奈衆寡不敵、一匪當場飲彈畢命、另一看票者亦遭拘獲、肉票周讓三至是即安然脫險、其後捕房方面又查得有同黨匿居大通路長康里一四零九號、派探前往捕獲男女兩匪、並前後搜出手槍兩支、子彈十五發、一併帶回捕房候解法院、惟周君自經此厄、精神上頗受剌激、因擬暫行離滬休養云、</p>
<h3>松东肉票脫綁</h3>
<p>徐文傑乘隙而出</p>
<p>警偵亟速查匪船</p>
<p>南市二區高昌廟分駐所、昨晨在邗江路港口附近、截獲綁票匪船一艘、當塲救出由松江綁來之大小肉票三口、並拘獲男女看票匪三人、茲將詳情錄次、</p>
<p>徐氏家世　松江人徐文傑、年二十九歲、世居松屬得勝港鄉間、祖業務農、遺有田産五十餘畝、文傑自幼讀書、前曾充該鄉小學校長兼敎務主任、闔家共八口、妻沈氏、祇育一子、名諤倌、方六齡、家庭之樂、融融如也、</p>
<p>强來綁去　前夜（二十五日）十一時許、徐闔家正入睡鄉、突來盜船三艘、上載綁匪十餘人、各執長槍盒子砲手槍等兇器、將徐宅大門撞開、一擁而入、各處搜刦殆遍、刦去金飾衣服約共二百元左右、臨去時、並將文傑本人及子諤倌、連徐十歲之外甥吳煥章、一併綁去、</p>
<p>乘舟抵滬　匪衆將徐等三人綁至船上、一齊藏後梢艙内、禁止聲張、隨即啓椗、直駛來滬、於翌日（二十六日）午後四時左右、泊高昌廟附近之邗江路港口、入晚給徐等以大餅油條西瓜等充飢、衆匪即各持械相率離船他去、祇留兩男兩女輪流看守、防範異常週密、·</p>
<p>看守狀態　四看守匪中、一女匪已年邁龍鍾、且不良於行、實際上祇有三人值守、當船泊定港口時、最先爲一男匪看守、入晚男匪疲極而臥、即命一中年女匪繼之、至夜深十一時許、該女匪因沿途勞頓、遂將後梢艙板緊蓋、便隨勢仰臥其上、以爲肉票旣在艙内、諒必不致有失、</p>
<p>肉票飛奔　女匪鼾睡移時、呼聲大作、竟於不知不覺中頻頻翻身、其時已離去原有位置、徐在艙内悶臥良久、不獲入睡、旣聞呼聲大作、徐遂鼓勇頂開艙板、定睛四顧、祇見女匪鼾臥一旁、徐亟躍登艙面、復將板蓋好、躡足下船、拔步沿港飛奔、</p>
<p>報警尋船　時在深夜、不辨東西、未幾遇一路人、徐即向前懇求援救、路人立將其引至高昌廟公安局二區分駐所報告、牛巡官聞訊、立即率同全班長警、各帶電筒武裝赶往、但徐當時已失去記憶力、方位莫辨、牛巡官復僱得划船四艘、分向沿浦及各港　兜拿、約歷三小時之久、卒將匪船尋獲、</p>
<p>拿獲四匪　徐當時指認明晣後、衆長警一擁上船、先在後梢艙内、將兩小肉票救出、然後搜獲看守匪兩男兩女、其一即年逾龍鐘不良於行者、暫由牛巡官派警看守、並復令鮑巡長化裝沿浦偵查匪跡、所獲三匪三肉票、一併移送二區總署候核、</p>
<p>鞫訊匪供　王區長親自逐細訊問一過、先由徐文傑申述被綁經過情形、詰之三匪、一供名陸生郭、年三十七歲、高郵人係船主、一供名高長立、年五十四歲、充船夥、女匪供陸王氏、年三十七歲、爲生郭之妻、三人均不認爲匪、祇認匪等由松江得勝港僱船來申、並不知有綁架情事、餘供支吾、王區長據供後、立即致函徐之家屬、一面備文一併申解市公安局司法科訊辦、</p>

<p>誘女入室强行女污　迨抵該宿舍亞之室外、見室内電燈已息、更無其夫踪跡、始悟被騙、掉首欲回、則亞已張臂攔阻、</p>

<h3>波蘭的文學</h3>
<p>波蘭在歐洲大戰前也是與印度埃及同遭亡國命運的國家、在俄德奥三國瓜公之下雖然經過了幾次的革命、仍然擺不脫强招貨底拁銷、但是在歐洲后她却得着了獨立、在她底爭取自由和獨立的歷程中我們不能忽略那推動波蘭革命的革命詩人和文學家、因爲他們曾經在歌中激發被壓迫的波蘭民族、他們曾經在傾覆俄德奥統治的戰爭中實際的奮鬥和掙扎、曾經在十九世紀的黑暗時代放着異樣的光芒、</p>
<p>在十九世紀中期便是波蘭文學的黄金時代、第一個可以稱爲波蘭的但丁的詩人便是、美基委茲（adam　Michiewicz）他的創作也恰和他底國家底悲劇樣、很遭着異外的變遷、曾經入獄、曾經流落在俄國和異域、因此、他的作品也因環境的剌激而變換、在獄中時他抛棄了玫瑰色的夢、他捨棄了變愛的歌頌、由早日萎靡的歌調一變而爲他底民族間全體的不幸遭遇的歌咏、後來、在反對俄國的統治戰爭中他歌咏兵士底勇敢和勝利之死、雖然他自己的命運也伴着失敗者同樣的不幸、但他底偉大却是全波蘭的民衆所景仰的、而且他對於波蘭全民衆所希冀的拿破崙打敗俄國的希望之失敗、把他寫成國民的史詩「泰達斯先生」（Ｍr,　Thaddaeus）、在内中含蓄着那不幸的包蔽着他底國家底雲翳、那每個人對於戰爭得勝的希冀、那在波蘭人心底充盈的波蘭民族復活的希望、都很生動的呈現着、所以、他爲了要實行他對於祖國復活的主義計、他不惜的組織波蘭軍去帮助别國攻打他們的主仇俄國和奥在利、雖然他在未臨敵前便死亡了、然而他始却是一個波蘭全民衆思想的領導者、永遠的居於先知的地位、而且在超於文學以外的指導、他是在實際中獲得實騐的波蘭國中第一個文學家、</p>
<p>與美基委茲的事業相對比的便是詩人斯洛委基（Ｈnlius　Slowacki）在藝術與文學的成功、雖然把詩歌作爲含蓄國家思想和宗敎哲學的工具、但在廣博的材料中、得注意於人類的感情、因此、在未完成的長史詩「柏尼夫斯基」Ｂeniowski）討論到國際與國家的宗敎與哲學的文學與社會的問題、「海中的落日」（at　sunseton　the　sea）和「亞加米落底墳墓」（Agamemonom,s　giave兩詩裏對於受暴力强迫瓜分了的國家的運命、國民的流落、都深切的在悲哀中給人們以强烈感情的激刺、所以在寫實方面說、他是更能把波蘭全民族底遭遇寫進去、所以、從他底全部作品來考察、「國王精靈」（The　Kingspirit）是叙述在各國統治者的時期中呈觀的祖國底魂靈、「可底安」（Codion）寫的是波蘭在一八三○年革命時代底全景「安西利」（Anhelfli）是波蘭犯人被流戍在寒冷的西比利亞牢獄底痛苦、都是波蘭民族在俄德奥三帝國瓜分之下的全部描寫、在同時代中他是與美基委茲齊名的、在十九世紀乃至二十世紀的波蘭文學、最能表示出革命熱情除了浪漫主義和寫實主義的幾個詩人、其他的人不是頺廢、便是　觀、所以同帮爲浪温主義三傑的、除了他倆外、還有「克拉辛斯基」（Sigismuna　Krasinsky）、雖然他是個對於哲學的人類事件不加深思的嚴肅詩人、但在「信仰底禱歌」（Psolm　of　faith）中回叙着波蘭痛苦的過去和她未來的使命、和預言着未來底成功底「希望底禱歌」（Psalm　of　love）描寫在革命與恐怖時必須的人類愛的「愛底禱歌」、（Pralmof　lone）都是不朽的作品、但是、在寫實主義中的收獲便没有浪漫主義詩人們所給予的偉大了、女詩人哥洛夫尼加MaryKonopnicka）是以民主主義爲骨子的工農和被壓迫者底痛苦的歌者、卜魯士（Ｂoleslaw　Prus）是具有民主主義思想而同情於平民的人道主義小說家、而能從波蘭的立塲獲得了世界聲譽的却要推顯克微支（Henry　Sienkieuicz）了、</p>
<p>顯克微支是近來波蘭最偉大的作家、在十九世紀的後半二十五年完　全是他一人的世界、他以長於寫歷史小說著名、除了一些帶着悲觀情調的作品而外、表現波蘭的作品也是很偉大的、在小說「守燈塔者」（The　Lighthouse　Keeper）描寫一個在西印度看守燈塔、因讀美基委茲的詩墜入故國思念以致誤事而被開除的、波蘭流民、反映着亡國者的悲哀、「瓦諾特約夫斯基先生」（Mr.Wolodyjowski）寫的是在前線抵禦土耳其人底勇敢、「火與創」（Fire　and　swcrd）寫的是波蘭人防禦哥薩克人的侵略的故事、「一個校長底日記」（The　diary　of　school　moster）寫的是俄羅斯帝國給與他們的壓迫、「得勝者巴特克」（Bortek　the　Conquerov）含着很濃重的波蘭民族精神、</p>
<p>以上的這羣作家都是在實騐哲學的思潮的環境中活動的人物、他們曾經立下了民衆文化上的標境和標柱、曾經在文學上立了一個新時代的界牌、曾經表示波蘭民族己經超出了階級精神之上、曾經把平民容納到燦爛的「神殿」（Ｐantheon）裏、曾經把貴族的史詩底技巧用來描寫被損害者的一切苦難和不幸、在實騐哲學失敗後、全文壇漸、爲那唱「爲藝術而藝術「（art　for　art）底高蹈派及印象派所佔領、　一直到近年來都没有如何的偉製、所有的也不過是一種藝術品而已、</p>
<p>在老作家顯克微支死掉以後、近十年萊蒙脫（Ｒeymont）呌出被壓者的反抗聲的什郎斯基（Zeromski）、提出個性反抗文學爲社會附屬物的布什比綏夫斯基（Przylyszewski）、人道主義的凱斯布羅維支（Kosprowicz）、都相繼先後的死了、在這一羣詩人、他們受了已死的凱斯布置維支底人道主義的影響、羣集在華沙出版「史凱曼道」（Scomander）刋物之下宣傳國際詩人底一切、但是、在華沙也有一羣以民族的傳說爲題材而發揚民族精神的靑年詩人、他們對於家鄉的感受很深、一切都是利用家鄉的神話歌謠與凡俗爲題材、在他們底刋物「克撒塔克」（Czartak）的領導之下、他們主張用簡單的初民的語言和藝術方法來表達民族精神、他們以詩人什喀特魯微支、（（Enril　Zegadlowicz）爲代表、在新波蘭國際派的詩人托温（Julian　Tuwin）成一種映照、在這兩種主潮中、因爲波蘭的國際地位關係、民族主義派的靑年詩人是更爲人民所歡迎了、（易康）</p>

<h3>厭煩交際的霍遜</h3>
<p>霍遜是美國近代作家中最愛孤獨的人、但是和别人討厭交際的他、而和愛瑪遜却是特别要好、</p>
<p>愛瑪遜是完全知道霍遜的脾氣、霍遜除了和愛瑪遜交際外、就討厭和其他一切的文字家來往、他以爲於其和文學家來往、還是和船長職工水夫等玩滑稽的游戲要有趣得多、</p>
<p>他和愛瑪遜雖常見而、但除了必要話外、也不說什麽、　而愛瑪遜也非常靜默、所以他倆就是見面、說的話、也是可以計算的、</p>
<p>馬克萊和希特尼斯密司相會時、二個人祗是對坐而無言、兩個口和封着似的一點鐘二點鐘甚至三點鐘的過去、這個故事恐怕誰者知道的了、</p>
<p>但霍遜和愛瑪遜究竟還比不上這一對兒的更利害、（平）</p>

<h3>湖上曲偉大的叙事長詩</h3>
<p>沐鴻作　南華書局出版</p>
<p>夜晚來捉着靑灰的夜呵、</p>
<p>我正在一個已經的鼓動的夢裏游行我的脚下是踏着兩條路子呀—</p>
<p>一條呌紅色的戰爭、一條呌紅色的愛情、</p>
<p>有人列我於撤旦之羣、</p>
<p>也有人呼我爲救世之星、</p>
<p>可我所有不只這單調的名號呵、</p>
<p>因爲我的心兒是我也莫名、</p>
<p>只是那老時代給了我苦悶和創痛未來的夢想又給了我向慕和追尋我便是人生中一個奮戰的孩元呀我不能禁住我的一心兒跳動……雖昨夜的爝火已息東方却尙未明雖今朝的大夢剛破、鷄聲終未聽聞、</p>
<p>說什麽戰爭呵、並什麽愛情</p>
<p>我便是在這裏呀　已過了一般暴風雨的生存……</p>
<p>在戰爭裏我發瘋過一兩次了、</p>
<p>在愛情裏我也一兩次發瘋、</p>
<p>正是愛與戰的雙翼呵、</p>
<p>曾自我的脅下横生、</p>
<p>至不能忘的是伊人的多情、</p>
<p>更不能忌的是湖山的雄影、</p>
<p>伊人呀湖山湖山呀伊人、</p>
<p>…………………………</p>
<p>以上湖山曲序曲前段</p>
<p>提到了這首偉大的叙事詩我便不能不想起和詩人沐鴻所同過的一段時候、那是十七年冬天、我們在北四川路底某衖堂的亭子間裏住了兩三個月、沐鴻、那是和一切眞正的詩人一樣的、靜默、温存、美麗、還加上敏稅的觀力、好的理智、和最熱烈的熱情、他那魁梧的北方型的軀體、站起來差不多要觸着抵矮的天花板了、常是默然坐在床前、屋子是太窄小了、我們不能在床上和桌子之間再放一張橙、於是他只好俯身向着桌子·或者躺下、微笑永不離開他的容顔、正如同未曾離開地平的朝陽在金色的雲霞間所作的微笑、他好的理智是常在觀照他内心的生活的、而以一種孩子似的純樸與人們關涉、就是同他過了一段生活、我覺得自己的氣質變化許多了、他不常看書、很少拿起筆來寫什麽東西、往往好幾個月、除了寫信—那也是很少的—不再動筆、但他一星期所看的書要超過我們一月所看的、他的每篇作品都在最短時期裏完成「紅日」日九天、「湖上曲」、三天、想一想在三天裏完成這樣偉大的作品、幾幾乎是一個奇蹟、</p>
<p>有一次、一办個朋友向我們說着下面的故事、據說是幾年前洞庭湖裏所發生的實事、他借那故事寫成了這篇作品、要我也拿同樣的故事寫成小說、說將來我們的可以合刋在一起、但我在看了他的詩之後却不再能寫一個字、直到現在、去年我拿這篇詩在南華圖書局發行了、連允許過的序言也没有寫下、因爲這首詩在我面前是太鉅大的巨人了、我不能夠給加上什麽、</p>
<p>這是一首眞正中國人的東西、中國人的故事、所歌唱着的是中國人的熱烈的情、用的是中國人的風格、他完成了中國的詩歌、舉起了羅曼斯的旗幟、而以這首詩向世界宣言、「看呵、這裏面有一些眞正偉大的東西、是我們的、從這裏面你們可以認識中國的靈魂、這裏面藴畜着我們的過去、也展示我們的未來、」這裏面歌頌着戰爭和愛情、人生活動的頂點、正如同一切羅曼斯所歌頌的一樣、然而這裏面、和舊的羅曼斯、也和新的馬克思主義的羅曼斯不同的地方是、這裏没有那麽濃厚的英雄主義和個人主義的色彩、我們的英雄、雙提着戰爭與愛情的、誠然也是一個英雄、但他又是多麽平常的一個普通人呵、他正如我們的兄弟、如我們所常親近的人們、他生活在傳奇的境况中、但他的生活已多麽和我們親切呵、這是一首歸於人類的宣言、走向人類完美的將來底進行曲、燃燒起我們民族旗幟熱的血液的火燄、純靜的光明和美滿的熱情、</p>
<p>這首三千多行的長詩是用一種美麗的調子寫的、像鑑鏘的歌曲、又像最流麗的散文、有一種使你開卷後就非談到最後一行不止的誘引力、而讀後又將永遠盤據在你的腦中、最美麗的、同時是最强有力的、假如有一個外國人向我問及中國的詩人與詩歌、我將毫不遲疑地最先提到「湖上曲」及其作者、（其次呢、我將提到柯仲平的「海夜歌聲」與「漠林—末臨」）</p>
<p>這是一首偉大的詩、如同一切偉大的詩—樣這裏面没有學說、没有敎義、没有政治、也没有什麽社會主義、無論是正確的或虚僞的、要從這裏面找到什麽可以寫作宣言或標語之類是不可能的、所以也就不能夠拿這些來批評他的、這是以人類的靈魂—但是照行爲主義的說法、不獨靈魂是没有的、連心也是、那麽我應該說是以人類完全整個的精神、以人類光明的行爲、都一樣—寫下來的、在這裏面、我們民族、人類全體中最大的一部份（除掉黄種集合在中國之下的人數、就是說、他們都有着某種重要的共同性質、可以拿中這個名詞代表的人數是最多的了、）的精神、是如何强烈地顯示在這裏面呵、</p>
<p>叙事詩的故事、略如下、一個流浪人歌着他的身世、從前因爲機緣逼迫、後他走到湖中、佔據了那面作了盜魁、以他光明的心性、熱烈的情緒、如靜江風起、掃蕩了湖心和湖岸、偶然、因爲琵琶的聲韻、他在不知覺間引動了一個有夫之婦的心、立刻强列的愛情在他們之間發生了、他冒着危險不顧一切來作他的情人、於是、一方面是糾結的愛情、一方面是不斷的戰爭、但湖上的英雄終於敵不住官廳長時期的壓迫、因爲内間、事業瓦解說她已被捕便矯裝到獄中看她—以後便長别了、走上他流浪的途程、</p>
<p>詩太美麗了、我無法徵引、恐怕寫得太多、如今只錄下末了一段結束我這陋文、</p>
<p>我今在—</p>
<p>這凄肅的夜裏呀、</p>
<p>還忘了傷痛、</p>
<p>因爲—</p>
<p>那愛、在眼前、</p>
<p>—憧憬……</p>
<p>你、你人、</p>
<p>你的臉、</p>
<p>芙蓉、</p>
<p>你的笑、</p>
<p>日紅、</p>
<p>你的眉、</p>
<p>山靑、</p>
<p>你的全腰肢、</p>
<p>海上虹、</p>
<p>無美的形容……</p>
<p>你的手、</p>
<p>白玉彫刻如畫影、</p>
<p>温温又如心、</p>
<p>又如湖水裏的聲音……</p>
<p>水心裏頭顫動的影……</p>
<p>夜光、蛙聲、水鳴、草動、……</p>
<p>一切你的象徵</p>
<p>你美的神靈、</p>
<p>—夜、</p>
<p>—夜、</p>
<p>—深深、</p>
<p>—沉沉、</p>
<p>暗暗地—</p>
<p>存心、無心、</p>
<p>我們相會了、</p>
<p>相會了、</p>
<p>有情、</p>
<p>再生、</p>
<p>從明日再誕生、</p>
<p>人類的精靈、</p>
<p>從明日再誕生、</p>
<p>我們的新心—</p>
<p>新的愛情、</p>
<p>底下還有、但不再徵引了、因爲這樣美的章節是抄不完的而且夜也很深了、</p>
<p>我們的詩人這時正在他的故鄉、在大自然的懐裏在貧困中、我也很久没有寫信給他了、這一點點拙陋的東西是不值得獻給他的、聊足以盡我的敬慕和懐想罷、　　十九年八月、培良、</p>
<h3>歐洲作家新著鳥瞰安琪列達（十一）</h3>
<p>— 曼如</p>
<p>西班牙阿左林作劇本</p>
<p>中國從前做小說編劇本的人有句古話、呌做「書不夠、菩薩來凑、意思就是說、情節到了被作者弄僵的時候、祇有請出菩薩神仙來轉圜、方才做得下去、因此、我們在舊小說舊戲裏、往往看見主人公遇到急難的時候、突然從天上來了個救星、這樣的辦法、當然是暴露了技巧上的軟弱、但對於作者刦非常方便、所以那一句古話、不但說盡了舊小說舊戲劇底淺陋、而且到現在都還適用、在西洋、這樣的情形也未嘗没有、但那還是在中民紀哩、一到十八世紀就完全斷根了、而且中世紀的「神蹟戲」（Miracle　Play）、多還是用菩薩來做個重要人物、和我們舊文藝中的把菩薩當作一頂浮橋、也有點不同、</p>
<p>神人與奇蹟之絶跡於西洋舞台和劇曲家之筆端者、到現在已經有二三百年了、但是到了最近、奇蹟似乎已經在歐洲的劇壇打起呵欠來、預備復活了、因爲、西班牙的戲曲家阿左林（Azorin）不但在他最近的劇本裏、替神蹟打了第一個呵欠、而且彰明較着地宣佈、神蹟非在歐洲劇壇上復活過來不可、</p>
<p>事實是這樣的、阿左林、西班牙底生産多而精美的作家、新近著了一部劇本、「阿琪列達」（Angelita）在這部劇本裏他應用了「神蹟」、而且應用得很好、至於他這個短劇呢、是又有生氣又有嬌媚、無疑地可算爲他的傑作之一、但是這個劇中之成功、到底是因爲引用了神蹟還是與神蹟毫不相干、那却很難斷言、因爲這一二者混和在一起、分不開來、不過作者底主張是神贵蹟奇事、在十八世紀紀逐出舞台的、應當再回到舞台上去、因爲「在可捉摸的顯著的現實之後、是存在着另一個更微妙、更眞實、更永久的現實、」</p>
<p>主人公安琪列達關心於她自己的未來命運、亟欲有所預知、她得到一只靑玉指環、這指環戴在手上、旋轉一次、就可以使她前進一年、她性急得很將這指環旋了兩次、於是她的年紀大了兩歲、她發現自己巳經結婚了、但是因爲事情來得太快、她攪不清楚、竟誤認她的公公爲好的丈夫、又誤認她的丈夫爲一個外人、後來她可旋了這指環五次、於是突然發現她的房子已經改變成一個心　病患者底醫院、最後、她遇到了三個安琪列達、其中兩個（一個是紐約女新聞記者、一個是某科學家底夫人）都不見了、而第三個化成現存的這個安琪列達、但是安琪列達這時候已經是一個窮了不少然而聰明了許多的女人了、</p>
<p>在現在這科學界變動很多、科學家對於時間空間有許多新研究的時代、一個文學家對於時間玩了這一點把戲、我們是不必非難的、何况阿左林底這篇作品、格調是輕鬆柔美、人物是個性明確、而對話又全篇迅速自然呢、</p>

<h3>Capital Citizens</h3>
<p>Victory Celebration Rally Circular Telegram</p>
<p>Also Telegraphed the Frontline Soldiers for Consolation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Capital Citizens' Victory Celebration Rally telegraphed the nation (titles omitted): "This time, Yan, Feng, Wang, Zou, and other rebels colluded for their own selfish purposes, betrayed the Central Government, raised troops to create chaos, and instigated Communist bandits to disrupt the rear. Not only did they prevent the people suffering under the oppression of Yan and Feng from seeing the light of day, but they also caused the people in our rear to suffer endless pain. Fortunately, Generalissimo Chiang demonstrated his courage and inspired the soldiers to eliminate most of the elite forces of the Yan and Feng rebels. However, the roots have not been eradicated, and the embers can still reignite. Therefore, in order to seek eternal peace, our people should take advantage of the opportunity when our army is defeating these rebels one by one, unite to uphold justice, denounce the rebels, and strive to completely eliminate these rebels and their bandits in the shortest possible time in order to eliminate the source of the disaster and consolidate the foundation of the country. 'If Qingfu is not removed, the troubles in Lu will not end.' If these rebels and Communist bandits are not destroyed, the people of our country will not have peace for a single day. We hope that our countrymen will rise up and plan for this. Furthermore, there is something that should be told to the national media: within a country, there is only the distinction between right and wrong, obedience and rebellion. There is no reason to be ambiguous. Those who are right and obedient should be praised. Those who are wrong and rebellious should be rejected. This is how it should be for ordinary people, and the media, which has the responsibility of guiding the people of the country, should have an even deeper understanding of this. Therefore, our people sincerely hope that the media will strictly distinguish between right and wrong, obedience and rebellion, and no longer maintain a bystander's neutral attitude, so as not to disappoint our people. We urgently make this statement and await your instructions. Sincerely, The Capital Citizens' Victory Celebration Rally."</p>
<p>"Also, a telegram consoling Generalissimo Chiang and the frontline soldiers who are suppressing the rebels (titles omitted): 'Yan and Feng incited chaos and harmed the people. The Central Government sought peace and repeatedly admonished them, but ultimately failed to curb their ambitions. Therefore, we entrusted Your Excellency with the task of suppressing bandits and pacifying the country. Since the swearing-in ceremony, thanks to your skillful command and the soldiers' dedication, we have been able to repeatedly defeat stubborn enemies and break their main forces. The recapture of Jinan this time is a great achievement. The prestige that has been established has shattered the dream of a secretly formed puppet government by Yan and Feng, and the illegally convened political meeting by Wang and others has disintegrated as a result. With the obstacles to political tutelage removed, true unification is within reach. The people's happiness, the nation's peace, is at stake in this one action. The blood sacrificed by the soldiers today will irrigate the flowers of freedom in the future. We send this telegram to offer our condolences and wish you victory.'"</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Revolution in Peru</h3>
<p>Today's revolution in Peru, though named the overthrow of the dictatorship, is in reality still a seizure of power by the military. I fear it still cannot reach the thorough goals of the Peruvian people.</p>
<p>Regarding the political situation in Peru throughout history, it is nominally a republic bordering the Pacific Ocean, but political power has always been in the hands of the military. In 1919, after Raguiya took advantage of a domestic coup to seize the presidency, he promulgated a constitution and stipulated various social legislation systems. On the surface, it had already broken away from military dictatorship. However, after Mr. Raguiya became president, he was dictatorial in everything, and soon became a dictatorial government again. When the Peruvian people resisted, he even wanted to organize a new military cabinet, thinking that this would curb popular sentiment. However, he did not know that it would only increase the people's anger. This is why the revolution broke out. However, the leader of the revolution was still a military man, in opposition to Mr. Raguiya's new military cabinet. After the revolution, a military government was still organized by General Boneste, so who knows if this military government will not immediately turn into a military cabinet in the future? This is why it is not thorough.</p>
<p>Regarding the history of the revolutionary movement in Peru, the movements of the Central and South American nations began with students. In the so-called university revolution and the so-called united movement of 1918, Peruvian students also worked hard. However, the purpose of the so-called revolution at that time was to oppose the oppression of American imperialism. Only when this final goal is achieved can it be called a successful revolution. However, the leadership of today's revolutionary movement, although there are many students participating, is still military. The final goal of the revolution, although it is anti-American, today's revolution is still a domestic political struggle. Today, a telegram from Berlin stated that the secretary of the Peruvian Nationalist Party declared in Germany that the success of this revolution can be seen as a major step on the road to breaking away from American influence and regaining freedom. His words are probably an exaggeration. Considering the current situation in Peru, this revolution is still like the previous coups, with the military fighting among themselves. It is just adding more disturbances. It is very far from being thorough.</p>
<p>Domestic Important Telegrams II</p>
<h3>Capital Victory Rally Telegram to Chiang</h3>
<p>Please Transfer Troops to Clear Communists</p>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 27th, the Citizens' Victory Celebration Rally telegraphed Chiang, requesting the transfer of troops to eliminate the Communist bandits. Today, the capital's citizens considered the recapture of Jinan and the crushing of the enemy to be a cause for celebration and held a victory rally at the public stadium. For a time, tens of thousands of people cheered, hearts were inspired, and the revolutionary atmosphere was extremely tense. Everyone believed that since the launch of our army, we have repeatedly recovered famous cities and eliminated ugly captives. Although this is due to the victory of doctrine over everything, it is also due to Your Excellency's decisive command and appropriate measures, as well as the concerted efforts, hard work, and dedicated service of all the soldiers. However, the remaining warlords at the front are like fish in a cauldron, and the wicked Communist bandits are still like trapped beasts. Since the riots in Changsha, which resulted in terrible disasters, the Communist bandits in various places have been restless and are implementing their policy of murder and arson. The compatriots in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces are suffering in deep water and fire. If we do not send more troops and strictly order them to be severely suppressed, how can we reverse the disaster and save the people's livelihood? Therefore, we unanimously decided to urge Your Excellency to immediately transfer a large army and task Director He and the military personnel in charge of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other provinces with eliminating all Communist bandits within their borders within a limited time, so as to eliminate their roots, maintain security in the rear, and preserve the nation's vitality.

Huang Xuchu, the rebel Huang, led more than 2,000 troops and was stationed near Ba Su, forming a defensive formation with Yong city. (2) After our army arrived at Yong and crossed the river, it immediately sent Sun's brigade to drive away the rebel Huang and advanced directly to Binyang, threatening Liuzhou.

In recent days, the front-line troops have been consolidating their defensive positions on the one hand and withdrawing westward on the other. (2) Our army has indeed arrived in Neihuang, but due to the fact that the water situation in the northeast of Lanfeng has not yet receded, we have not made rapid progress.

<h3>Fang Zhang Go to Yongchun Together</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) Fang Shengtao and Zhang Zhen went to Yongchun together on the 26th. It is not true that Lu Xingbang is increasing troops in Dehua. Lu currently has no troops to transfer. Xu Feilong is still guarding Dehua and has not entered Yushui. One division has transferred artillery to Yong to assist in the battle because Xu is guarding the border of Dehua and the blockhouses are difficult to take down. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Meeting on the Abolition of Submarine Cable Agreement</h3>
<p>The Two Sides Still Have Differences of Opinion</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The case on the abolition of the submarine cable agreement continued to be held at a joint meeting at 10:00 AM on the 27th. Our side was attended by the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and various members of the International Telecommunications Negotiation Committee, while the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific Cable Company were represented by Taylor LeFevre, Peng Sheng, Hobert Digentaut Bukoto, etc. The company representatives generally agreed to the new principles previously put forward by our side for the purpose of recovering sovereignty. However, with regard to implementation and management, the representatives still relied on the counter-proposals put forward by the companies. In name, they were respecting the sovereignty of the Republic of China, but in reality, they still wanted to maintain their long-standing interests. Our chief representatives insisted that the implementation methods must be stipulated in accordance with the new principles, focusing on substance rather than empty names, in order to implement the proposals thoroughly. Therefore, there were considerable differences of opinion and further discussions were needed. Issues such as increasing quotations and distributing benefits are also important keys to resolving this case. At 3:00 PM in the afternoon, special commissioners from both sides continued to hold a meeting, intending to submit the results of the discussion to the next meeting. Since the Great Eastern and Great Northern companies had separate proposals, it was decided to hold separate meetings with representatives of the two companies on the morning of the 28th. A joint meeting with representatives of the three companies will still be held in the afternoon. (27th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhuang Zhihuan talked about the issue of abolishing the submarine cable contract. Regarding the point of landing rights, the previous government did not fundamentally understand the four legal sovereignties, which led to past losses. Now, restrictive measures have been clearly defined, that is, foreign companies' cables landing in Chinese territory must abide by the rules set by our country. Furthermore, regarding the rights of transmission and reception, the companies previously set up bureaus to send reports, and our side could not interfere. This point also violated sovereignty. Inspection measures have now been drafted and submitted to the meeting for detailed discussion. As for the item of quotations, the current allocation of our side is only 1.356%. Based on the Sino-Russian method of allocating reporting fees, which is one franc per word, our side has suffered a great loss. However, the representatives have proposed the Japanese method of allocating quotations, which is only 30% per word, France is only 20%, and the United States is only 40% as an excuse. Our side can never recognize this. (27th Dispatch)</p>

President Leguía led his two sons aboard the cruiser "Grozny" to flee, but the ship had only sailed twelve miles out of the harbor when it received a radio message ordering it to return within 48 hours and hand over the former president, otherwise, the ship's crew would be subject to military trial.

<h3>The Japanese Privy Council's Third Detailed Examination Meeting</h3>
<p>Presents Six Questions to the Government</p>
<p>Approval of the Naval Treaty Still Needs Time</p>
<p>(Telegraphic dispatch from Tokyo, 27th) The third detailed examination committee held a meeting at 1:00 PM yesterday. Committee Chairman Ito designated Kaneko Kentaro to begin questioning: (1) What is the basis for Japan's defense expenditure, which is determined to be 70% of that of the United States? (2) Is it true that the Japanese plenipotentiary delegation declared three major principles in Washington on their way to England? (3) Please explain the important inquiries and responses exchanged between the Japanese government and the plenipotentiaries during the London Conference. (4) Was the conclusion of the meetings and negotiations between plenipotentiaries Matsudaira and Ri Da the American proposal or a compromise proposal? (5) During the inquiries, what kind of compromises did Plenipotentiary Zaibu attempt to make with the Naval General Staff? Is this true? (6) When abandoning the three major principles and making concessions, what kind of measures were taken? The questions involved minute details. Foreign Minister Shidehara gave a detailed account of the diplomatic process. Naval Minister Zaibu described the subtle negotiations that led to the unavoidable abandonment of the three major principles. Prime Minister Hamaguchi strongly defended Naval Minister Zaibu's actions from the perspectives of diplomatic relations and finance. After the answers were completed, Committee members Kawai and Kuroda wanted to continue questioning, but Committee Chairman Ito proposed that it was too hot today and that the questioning should be suspended for now. It was decided that the fourth committee meeting would be held at 1:00 PM on the 28th, and the meeting adjourned. Today's meeting was Kaneko Kentaro's solo performance and can be seen as a reconnaissance battle for the issue of supreme command. (Telegraphic dispatch from Tokyo, 27th) Only the three ministers attended the fourth detailed examination committee, entering into a genuine questioning battle. Given this situation, it will be difficult to hold a formal meeting of the Privy Council at the beginning of September. Even if it proceeds smoothly, it will be at the end of September or the beginning of October. The government said that even if the British mainland approves it, Ireland must convene parliament in November to give its support. The completion of British approval will be considerably delayed, so a slight delay in the Privy Council's deliberation is not a problem.</p>

<h3>Capital Citizens' Victory Celebration</h3>
<p>The citizens of the capital, because the Central Army has recovered Jinan, and military victories are frequent, and the Communists in Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi are being eliminated by the Central Army, which is a blessing for the future of the Party and the nation, will hold a victory celebration at the Public Stadium at 9:00 AM on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Capital Victory Celebration Photograph 1</h3>
<p>The meeting was attended by more than 10,000 people from various levels of party headquarters, agencies, and agricultural, industrial, commercial, academic, women's and other groups, presided over by Shi Weihuan, executive member of the Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters, who delivered the opening remarks, stating that the Central Army had abandoned Jinan due to strategic considerations a month ago, luring the enemy deep, and at that time rumors arose, and the general public could not help but doubt the strength of the Central Army. At the same time, the Communist Party of Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi, also colluding with the Northern warlords and the Reorganization Clique, took the opportunity to cause disturbances. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers bravely advanced, with one acting as a hundred, and finally achieved strategic success. Jinan has been recovered, and the main force of the Jin rebel army has collapsed and become disorganized. Recently, our army took advantage of the victory to advance and has reached Yucheng, taking the offensive to Pingyuan and Dezhou. The elimination of the rebel movement is not far off, and the obstacle has been removed, and unification is not difficult to achieve. This is truly something to be celebrated by the country and the people. Now the people of the country have understood the principle of those who obey survive and those who rebel perish, and they have also recognized the abundance of the central government's power. The international perspective has also greatly changed. In the past, imperialists held a wait-and-see attitude towards diplomacy, with no sincerity to resolve issues, and frequently made propaganda unfavorable to the central government, hoping to form a united front with warlords and all reactionary forces of the Communist Party. Now that the rebel forces have been defeated one by one, they are gradually expressing their approach to the diplomatic authorities, wanting to resolve all diplomatic issues. All of this is the good result of the efforts and sacrifices of the officers and soldiers at the front. All of our comrades and compatriots should admire them and express twelve points of grief for the generals and soldiers who are selfless and gave their lives in battle. In the future, we should work together towards the path of peaceful unification, eliminate internal strife forever, and do our best to deal with foreign affairs, to save the country, and to rescue the people, etc. At this time, the citizens of the entire venue observed three minutes of silence for the deceased generals and soldiers. Next, Yang Xiji, representative of the National Government, gave a speech, recounting the crimes of the Yan, Feng, and Wang rebel parties, hoping to eliminate all counter-revolutionary forces in the shortest possible time and ensure that there will be no successors to Yan, Feng, and Wang in the future, so as to use force to guarantee domestic unification, so that we can obtain a free and equal position in the international community. Next, Li Yuanbai of the Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters gave a speech, saying that in this recovery of Jinan, the officers and soldiers at the front had each embraced the determination to sacrifice, and their loyalty and bravery were commendable. The achievements of Comrade Yang Jie, who designed the crossing of the Dawen River, and Comrade Xia Douyin, who firmly defended the city of Qufu, are especially unforgettable.</p>
<h3>Capital Victory Celebration Photograph 1</h3>
<p>The military operations on the Jinpu and Longhai Pinghan Railways have all achieved related victories, and the success of suppressing the rebellion is just around the corner. However, the harm of the Communist Party to the nation must be eradicated with all our efforts in the future. The Communist Party uses farmers and workers to cause disturbances, and countless farmers and workers have been sacrificed by them. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention to legitimate movements in the future and not be deceived by them.

<h3>Song Ziwen Talks</h3>
<p>The Process of Establishing the Salt Revenue Loan</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Hankou) Since Finance Minister Song Ziwen came to Hankou, his only task has been to complete the salt revenue loan and solicit short-term customs treasury bonds. The outside world does not know much about the situation of his contacts with various parties in recent days. Yesterday, a reporter from a certain agency visited him for an interview, and Mr. Song gave a very detailed conversation. The records of his answers are as follows: Reporter (Q): It was recently heard that the third salt revenue loan from Hubei banks is 3 million yuan. Thanks to your negotiations with the commercial banking group, the contract will be signed today (25th). Can you tell us the main points of the contract? Song (A): The salt revenue loan will indeed be signed today, with a loan amount of 3 million yuan, fully underwritten by the local commercial banking groups. It will be secured by 5 million yuan in promissory notes issued by the Hubei Salt Transport Bureau (i.e., issuing 1 million yuan in promissory notes each month from December this year to April next year). The interest rate is 1.2% per month. The aforementioned loan will be delivered to the national treasury in full in seven installments (every five days) starting from September 1st. Starting from September 1st, the commercial banks will jointly elect representatives to be stationed at the bureau to collect taxes and repay each bank on a bi-weekly basis. Regardless of the Hubei salt revenue, the principal and interest of the aforementioned loan should be fully repaid before April next year. (Q): The use of the aforementioned loan will naturally be to cover military expenses. However, the previous second Huai Salt loan of 3 million yuan and the refined salt loan of 1 million yuan were also mortgaged with salt revenue. How will the remaining balances be repaid? (A): Of the old debts, only 100,000 to 200,000 yuan are still owed from the 3 million yuan, and it will be repaid in full with principal and interest by the end of this month. The remaining balance of the 1 million yuan refined salt loan will be repaid by the national treasury by the end of November to clear the procedures. (Q): It is heard that the Hubei Finance Commissioner's Office collects national taxes, originally scheduled to collect more than 2.6 million yuan per month, and the office pays 2.51 million yuan per month for the Central Army's expenses here. In recent months, the income has decreased sharply due to the disturbance of the communist bandits. Only more than 400,000 yuan was collected last month, and the military expenses cannot be defaulted. How will this be remedied? (A): The situation of the shortfall in national tax revenue here is indeed as you said, and the previous second salt revenue loan needs to be repaid as agreed, which is also one of the reasons for the shortage of tax revenue. It is found that the income of the commissioner's office in June, July, August is offset, and there is a shortfall of more than 2 million yuan, all of which are related to the payment of the Central Army's expenses here. In fact, it cannot be delayed. Therefore, I came here specifically to complete this salt revenue loan to provide financial assistance. You asked how to remedy it in the future, which is indeed a current issue. However, based on my observation, the shortfall in national tax revenue due to the disturbance of the communist bandits is a temporary abnormality. Only by weighing the urgency can we find ways to divert funds to cope with it at any time. Once the military problem is resolved and the communist bandits are cleared, the tax revenue will return to its original level, and it will no longer be a problem. However, the collecting officials must be responsible for thoroughly reorganizing it. (Q): Due to the trouble of the communist bandits in various counties, Hubei local finance has been short of tax revenue for four months in May, June, July, August, and the accumulated deficit has been more than 2 million yuan. Now there is no way to divert tens of thousands of yuan. It is heard that the person in charge has been asking you for relief for days. What is the process? (A): I have already understood the current difficulties of Hubei finance. The reason is nothing more than the impact of the temporary disturbance of the communist bandits. How to find ways to relieve them is a matter related to local finance and should be handled by the competent authorities. If there are matters that should be requested from the central government in accordance with the law, as long as the principle of taking into account both the central and local governments can be followed, the Ministry of Finance will not fail to provide convenience. Zhang Xinbai, the director of the Finance Department of Hubei Province, has stated the various issues before and after, and I have replied based on this principle. (Q): It is heard that you have been soliciting customs treasury bonds from the provincial and municipal authorities. The provincial government said that the provincial treasury is empty and the local area is extremely depressed, and there is no real ability to underwrite them. What is the result of the negotiations? (A): It is found that the treasury bonds are being solicited from all provinces. I recently went to Zhenjiang and Hangzhou to visit the provincial authorities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. It is said that they have agreed to be responsible for selling them. It must be known that the central government issues treasury bonds, which are originally required by the state. The central government's difficulties are also the difficulties of the local governments. The so-called central and local governments belong to the same body, which is the meaning of this. I have repeatedly contacted Chairman Wu and Director Zhang and Mayor Liu about this matter. At 12:00 this afternoon, I will have a small gathering with Wu and others here to make the final agreement on soliciting treasury bonds. If the province really has difficulties, I will ask the two governments of the province and the city to work together to handle it with the commissioner's office. (Q): The order to implement the abolition of transit dues is about to expire soon. In Hubei Province, the unified tax revenue is about 10 million yuan, and all local government expenses rely on its payment. If the abolition is implemented as scheduled, even if special consumption taxes and business taxes are continued to be levied, it will be enough to offset part of it, but the focus of these tax sources is in Hankou City, not within the scope of the provincial government. How will this be relieved in the future? (A): This point really needs to be considered. I believe that this kind of difficulty must be solved by the joint efforts of the province and the city. Shanghai is the essence of the whole country. If everything is considered to belong to the city, not only Jiangsu Province will feel very difficult, but the entire finance of the central government will not be able to start. Fortunately, Mayor Liu and the members of the provincial government here are very harmonious in spirit. In the future, the distribution of materials on the war front will naturally not be divided into boundaries. Everything can be discussed and handled in detail in the spirit of cooperation.</p>
<h3>Three-Province Bandit Suppression Army Establishes Contact</h3>
<p>Zhu, Mao, Zhang, and Huang Gather in Tonggu and Wanzai</p>
<p>Hunan and Jiangxi Armies Encircle Tonggu and Wanzai</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Nanchang) The joint suppression of Peng, Huang, Zhu, and Mao by the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi has been reported in this newspaper many times. Commander-in-Chief Lu sent Model Company signal combat planes to fly to the area of Gaoan, Shanggao, and Wanzai on the 25th to scout for traces. He reported back to the province that the main forces of Zhu, Mao, and Peng are still gathered in the area of Tonggu, Wanzai, and Xiushui, and have not fled elsewhere. There are no large communist bandits in Shanggao and Gaoan, only scattered small groups remain. According to news from the provincial government, after being severely attacked by Dai's Brigade in Xiu and Tong, Zhu and Mao retreated to the Daweshan stronghold in the border area of the three provinces. Chen Guangzhong's Brigade, the vanguard of the anti-banditry force of the Fourth Army of Hunan, has chased to the vicinity of Daweshan and is attacking Tonggu. The Xi Yi two brigades of the new 32nd Division advanced from Pingliu to Xiushui. The above two departments have established contact with the Dai Brigade of the 18th Division and are forming a large encirclement of the bandits in Tonggu and Wanzai. However, most of the bandits are hiding in the deep mountains, making it difficult to search and suppress them. Since the Changsha Incident, the central government has attached great importance to the suppression of bandits in the three provinces. Commander-in-Chief Chiang decided to send three more divisions west to be commanded by Director He after the victory of the Jinan counterattack. The two brigades of the 50th Division of the Ninth Army under Tan Daoyuan (the 150th Brigade had already returned to Jiangxi and was stationed on the Nanxun Road) have received orders to return to Jiangxi to suppress the bandits. Commander-in-Chief Lu received a telegram from Chief of Staff Zhu in Nanjing yesterday, stating, "I have just received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief Chiang ordering Tan's Division to send a brigade back to Jiangxi first on You Day, and the rest to depart one after another." After receiving the telegram, Lu has telegraphed the Adjutant's Office to prepare vehicles and ships, and prepare to welcome them. The three-province anti-banditry meeting is now scheduled to open on the 27th. The provincial government has appointed Wang Yinxi, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Lu Xiaochen, Director of the Security Office, as representatives to attend. The two men took the Nanxun train to Xun on the 25th and transferred to the west. (26th)</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Arrests Communists for Days</h3>
<p>Confessions of Yu Zuoyu and Others After Being Arrested</p>
<p>Military Police Also Capture Three Criminals in the Suburbs</p>
<p>(Dispatch from Guangzhou) The Special Investigation Section of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau recently followed and arrested Yu Zuoyu, an important member of the Communist Party in Guangxi Province, and his accomplices Li Zhenyu, Chen Jinglu, and Ri Chang at the Shenzhen Station. Yesterday, the Public Security Bureau interrogated Yu and others. According to Yu Zuoyu, he is 30 years old, from Beiliu, Guangxi Province, a graduate of the Jiangwu Hall of the Second Training Army, and served as a platoon leader and company commander under Lin Hu. Under Li Zongren, he rose from battalion commander to regimental commander, and deputy division commander of the First Division of the Seventh Army. In October last year, Li Mingrui appointed him as the commander of the Fifth Brigade of the Guangxi Garrison. In January this year, the Central Committee of the Communist Party sent Deng Bin to Longzhou, Guangxi, to organize the Zuojiang Revolutionary Committee and the Youjiang Soviet Government. He once held a mass rally, and I also participated. In February, the Revolutionary Committee appointed him as the commander of the Eighth Army of the Communist Red Army. At that time, there were more than 600 troops, and there were also 1,700 troops in the department of Zhang Yi, commander of the Seventh Army of the Red Army. Li Mingrui was the commander-in-chief of the Red Army, stationed in Baise. He had fought three fierce battles with Huang Shaoxiong's troops. His own troops were defeated, and only more than 300 guns remained. He fled to Sile County, and the rest of the troops were commanded by Liu Guiting. After the failure, he fled from the Guangxi border to Beihai, and then went to Vietnam by sea. From Vietnam to Hong Kong, the Communist Party Provincial Committee ordered him to return to Guangxi to gather the old troops of the Red Army and join Li Mingrui's troops to go to Zhu De in Hunan. On the 17th, he was arrested at Shenzhen Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon train. Li Zhen, whose character name is Zi, confessed that he is 23 years old, from Guiping County, Guangxi Province, and was a teacher in a Guangxi middle school. In the 16th year of the Republic, he was introduced by Hou Lizhe to join the Communist Youth League.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>He was in charge of the group leader. In October last year, he was assigned by Pan Qing, secretary of the special branch, to be responsible for the Communist student movement. He failed in Guangxi before and fled to Hong Kong last month. He was sent by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party to Dongjiang to participate in the work of the Special Committee. Chen Jing (i.e., Liao Guanghua) confessed that he is 26 years old, from Shangsi County, Guangxi Province. He served as an executive committee member of the Dongnan Township Farmers' Association in Shangsi County, Guangxi. In March this year, he was introduced by Nie Gen to join the Communist Party and became a member of the Agricultural Committee, organizing farmers' troops and restoring farmers' associations. In April, Red Army Commander Yu Zuoyu was chased by the militia in Matoushan, and he led the farmers' troops to rescue him from the encirclement. Later, he followed Yu Zuoyu to Hong Kong through a side road. He is now being sent to Huizhou by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party. Lu Richang (i.e., Wang Keqiang) confessed that he is 34 years old, from Shangsi County, Guangxi Province. He served as a member of the Agricultural Committee of Dongnan Township in Shangsi County and as a special commissioner for agricultural movement in Guangxi Province. In November last year, Yu Zuoyu appointed him as the county magistrate of Zuojiang County. In March this year, he was introduced by Nie Gen to join the Communist Party. In May, Yu Zuoyu was trapped in Matoushan, and he and Liao Guanghua led the farmers' troops to rescue him. Later, he followed Yu to Beiliu and went to Hong Kong through a side road. He is now being sent to Huizhou by the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party, and was arrested on the way. Since the arrest of Yu and others, the anti-communist work in Guangzhou has become more rigorous. The military police have been sending detectives to investigate for days. On the 20th, they found that communists were hiding in the stone factory behind Guanyin Mountain and in Nan Village, Henan. The military police team attached Yu, platoon leader Zhang, and squad leader Zou changed their clothes and went to search. When they arrived at their destination, they saw communists Liang Ziping, Gan Lin, and Tian Yuping gathering. They suspected that the three were arrested and sent to the military police headquarters for handling. It is heard that the three men had rioted several times in Wuhua County in the 15th, 16th, and 17th years of the Republic, and fled to Nanyang afterwards. Wuhua County had purchased and arrested them. Recently, the three men thought that two years had passed, so they sneaked back to Guangzhou and made some moves. After arriving in Guangdong, they disguised themselves as workers and fortune tellers, but they were finally detected by the detective and captured in one fell swoop. (August 22)</p>
<p>Local dispatches</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>There is another kidnapping case in Fengjing: Cases of robbery and kidnapping by bandits in the Fengjing area are constantly emerging. Recently, it has gradually reached farmers who do not have much property, but they have also been coveted by bandits. For example, the grandson of Sun Xiangyu, a farmer in the 28th and 29th wards of Sanbao, who is only six years old, and the seven-year-old son of Zhu Jingui were both kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 29th of the abolished lunar June. It is heard that the Sun and Zhu families are not wealthy, but they have been diligent in farming over the years and have not been in debt. Now there is no news.</p>
<p>Petition to prohibit the opening of Hengshan: Hengyun Mountain is one of the Nine Peaks of Songjiang and has always been known as a scenic area. There is the place where Lu Yun of the Jin Dynasty studied, and there are also the ancestral tomb and ancestral hall of Zhang Zhao, a local worthy. There are many ancient tombs on it. Recently, it was heard that Wang Jisheng, in the name of Wang Hengshan, has petitioned the Department of Agriculture and Mining to collect mountain stones, and the provincial department has ordered the county to investigate and reply. Now it is learned that the descendants of the Zhang family said that although there is Wang's land on Hengyun Mountain, it is not all owned by the Wang family, and it is less than forty feet away from the Zhang family's ancestral hall, which obviously hinders the tombs of local worthies. They have appealed to the county government to forward the petition to the Department of Agriculture to prohibit it.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>The assistant's actions are out of line: Liu Zhendong, assistant to the first district (graduate of the second session of the district chief training institute), does not work very hard on weekdays. Recently, he colluded with a villager in the eighth district to accuse Jin Deji, the district chief of the district, of bad deeds. Unexpectedly, the draft was suddenly lost and picked up by someone, who sent it to District Chief Jin. District Chief Jin believed that the accusations made by the member were all castles in the air and took a photo of the draft to report to the county government for investigation. After receiving the report, Magistrate Pang believed that the member's actions were out of line and immediately ordered his dismissal. It is heard that the district chiefs of the ten districts in the county have petitioned the provincial government for investigation.</p>
<p>Lake bandits wash away Jinjiazhuang: Jinjiazhuang in the county is located in the Dianpu River. Usually, residents go in and out by boat as a ferry. It is an area where lake bandits often appear. At about 10 pm on the 25th, more than ten bandit ships suddenly came to the area. More than two hundred lake bandits, fully armed, landed on the shore and went to the security team first to seize seven guns. Then they washed away the entire village. Of all the more than six hundred households, only more than thirty households were spared. When the robbery was carried out, the former manager Gu Dajun was shot and killed. At twelve o'clock, the robbery was completed. Before leaving, Gu Shande and other fourteen men and women were kidnapped and taken to the ship, whistling towards the south of Dianpu Lake. On the 26th, District Chief Zhang Zhiping of the district came to the city to report to the county for arrest. Magistrate Pang immediately ordered Police Captain Luo to lead a row of police officers to go to suppress and arrest them. At that time, the bandits had already left like the yellow crane. The village is now handling the aftermath.</p>

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Hunan Refugees Come to Changshu from Wuxi:  A large number of Hunan refugees came to Changshu from Wuxi via Yangjian and other places.  The Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the news, dispatched police to suppress them. The refugees intended to stay in the city, but the Public Security Bureau, due to recent local unrest, escorted the refugees to Ouchu Town that evening (the 25th), where they were lodged in temples and under the eaves of houses along the way.  The next morning, local residents and merchants raised 40,000 copper coins to give to the refugees' representatives as travel expenses.  The police escorted them to Baijie Zhitang, and then they went to Kunshan. Some traveled on foot, while others, suffering from illness, hired boats to travel by water. When the refugees left Ouchu Town, two representatives, Fang Yusheng and Tan Peng, posted a notice. The writing was not entirely coherent, but one section read: "We, the disaster victims, are from Xinhua, Hunan.  We have suffered countless hardships due to repeated warfare and rampant bandits. We have been subjected to cruel torture and wanton looting. Our houses have been turned to scorched earth. Innocent lives have been sacrificed. We cannot live.  Having no other recourse, we petitioned our county government for passports to beg for food in other provinces. Therefore, we lead men, women, old and young, totaling over a hundred, and pass through various places along the way, without disturbing anyone."</p>
<p>Police and Bandits Exchange Fire in Hupu Town:  In the ancient village town, more than ten miles away from the city, four bandit boats arrived at about 2 a.m. the day before yesterday (the 26th), carrying a total of fifty or sixty bandits, all armed with guns. They entered Baiyu Weng and Ayu Estuary outside the East Gate from East Lake. They encountered a shrimp basket boat on the way in the One Family Lane near Guli Village and forcibly took the boat owner, Li Sisi, to row the boat. They then arrived at the west end of Guli Village Town, landed, and tied up Song Qian and two others nearby.  The farmers in the area, hearing the alarm, beat gongs to gather the masses and sent a special messenger to report to the Security Corps headquarters.  After receiving the report, the team's Second Detachment set out first to guard Ayu Estuary.  Shao Junbi, the captain of the First Detachment, led platoon leader Lu Weinong and others to deploy defenses at key points in the town.  A unit of armed soldiers chased to Baimao Estuary and saw several boats moving ahead. The Security Corps fired first, ordering the boats to stop. The bandit boats fired back while fleeing towards the Miaoshang Hupujiao area. However, the team members were chasing on land, and when they reached Miaoshang, they suddenly encountered a lack of water and immediately turned back.  Li Songqian and the three who had been tied up were not released.  After investigation, it was only known that Li Sisi was fifty years old, lived in Toutu, Forty-sixth Du, outside the South Gate, and made a living by fishing. He has a son.  The Public Security Bureau has been asked to send police to rescue him.</p>
<p>Another report states that yesterday evening (the 26th) at about 7 p.m., the Public Security Bureau received a long-distance telephone report from Shao Qiubai, the chief of the Hupu Township Public Security Sub-Bureau, stating that a large gang of bandits, about sixty or seventy people, had arrived there and were exchanging fire with the police and Security Corps in Bixi Market (three miles from the town).  After receiving the report, the headquarters dispatched Chief Inspector Lu Jinchen to gather the chiefs and police of various sub-stations, as well as the box cannon team, and took a gasoline boat to Meili Town (eighteen miles from Hupu) to set up a defense. At the same time, a special curfew was announced in the city.  The reporter, hearing the news, used the telephone to inquire at a certain rice shop in Hupu Town. It was said that those who arrived were refugees and had already withdrawn from the territory. The Security Corps and others had returned to their original defenses, but the residents were still in a state of unease.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Xicheng Road is Dangerous to Drive On:  The southern section of the Xicheng Highway, which broke ground on April 3rd of last year, did not hold a traffic opening ceremony until the 20th of this month. The entire road is twenty-seven miles long and cost a total of over 90,000 yuan. However, the coal slag paved on the entire road is not very thick. Driving cars on the day it opened to traffic already felt dangerous. Because the road surface soil is very loose, the wheels sink into the mud and cannot move forward. Moreover, the day after the opening, there was a heavy thunderstorm day and night, and the soil felt even looser and more floating. Therefore, cars can only go to Tangtou these days. It is reported that someone has submitted a request to the Construction Department, asking for ways to provide relief to avoid public danger.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Recovered and Left Wuxi to Return to Their Units:  There are still more than 700 wounded soldiers being treated at the Twenty-second Rear Hospital stationed in Wuxi. Recently, 295 of them have recovered. President Cai sent a letter to the station requesting three cars to be prepared. Yesterday (the 27th) at about 12 noon, they took the train to Beijing and then went to the front to return to their units.</p>
<p>Former County Magistrate Sun Went to Japan for Inspection:  Sun Zuji, the former county magistrate of this county, went to Shanghai after handing over his official seal. Admiring the development of Japanese industry and commerce, he took the Shanghai Maru steamship to set sail for Japan the day before yesterday (the 26th) for inspection.</p>
<p>Further Arrests in the Jiuli Base Robbery Case:  The Third Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau outside the South Gate previously arrested three suspects, including Yu Sanbao, in the Jiuli Base robbery case in Yangming Township. They had already been interrogated and confessed, and were being held for trial. The day before yesterday, the Eighth Sub-Bureau of the Public Security Bureau received a tip that Qian Ada, a fugitive in the case, had secretly returned to Zou. Patrol Chief Liang Desheng was dispatched to Nanqiao and arrested Qian Ada. After being brought back to the bureau, a local thug, Zhu Pangen, incited Qian's concubine to cause trouble for the Eighth Sub-Bureau. Yesterday, they were all sent to the city for trial. False Alarm of Bandits Gathering at a Garden:  Yesterday, the County Public Security Bureau suddenly received a tip that more than 20 bandits were secretly gathering at Liyuan in Yangming Township, plotting wrongdoing. Director Xu, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Chief Inspector Qian Tianxiong to lead police officers and drive a speedboat to Liyuan. However, after searching the entire garden, nothing was found. The villagers said that they had only seen a village boat being towed by a steamship, moored in the center of the lake, with more than 20 people, both men and women, but they did not know where they had gone. After receiving the report, Chief Inspector Qian immediately searched the surrounding lakes in all directions, but found nothing. He then returned to the bureau to report back.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>The County Government Closes the Zhunti Nunnery:  The county party department previously received a complaint from citizens that the dirty nun Changjing of the Zhunti Nunnery and the inferior monk Mingyuan had an adulterous relationship. In February of this year, the Fifth Sub-Bureau of Public Security Bureau cracked down on the nunnery's gambling and opium den. Mingyuan escaped upon hearing the news and has not been arrested yet. The nun Changjing has not shown any signs of restraint. The case was investigated by the county party department and found to be true. The county government was notified to carry out the expulsion. It is reported that the county government sent police to close it yesterday and implemented the expulsion of the dirty nun to restore morality and maintain security.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>The Entire Town of Taozhuang Was Robbed:  At about 5 a.m. on the 26th, more than 20 bandit boats suddenly arrived in Taozhuang Town, with more than 200 bandits, speaking the Jinshan dialect, with red cloths wrapped around their left arms, all holding wooden shell guns and pistols, etc. They charged from the west of the town to the water police detachment, firing shots as a demonstration, wounding police officer Wu Xiushan. Eleven guns were robbed. They then went to the public security substation and the security corps, and the two sides exchanged fire for about two hours. The security corps was out of ammunition and was broken into by the bandits. Five members of the Security Corps, platoon leader Zou Yunfei, team members Guo Chilian, Ge Jinkui, Jiang Wen, and Wei Dewen, were killed. Patrol Officer Gao Zhiming was shot in the upper left breast and seriously injured. Ten carbines were robbed. Eight bandits were also killed. The bandits carried away the bandit corpses on the bandit boats. More than 30 shops were robbed, including Yufeng Rice Shop, with losses of more than 10,000 yuan. Afterwards, reports were sent to the county government, public security bureau, water police team, and other departments to go to suppress them, but the bandits had already fled far away.</p>
<p>Another piece of news states that since the bandit leader Taibao A Xu sneaked back to Jinshan, the residents of Jiashan, Pinghu, and other places in Zhejiang have been terrified. Unexpectedly, at 5:30 a.m. on the 26th, a large group of bandits, 160-170 people, with sharp guns, attacked Taozhuang in Jiashan. The town was stationed with the Fourth Detachment of the Eighth Water Police Team. After the bandits arrived in the town, they first cut the telephone lines and then surrounded the water police detachment, hoping to disarm them. The detachment and the local security corps fired at the bandits to resist. After about two hours of fierce fighting, five members of the corps and police were injured and eight bandits were killed. Because of the disparity in numbers, the official army gradually became overwhelmed. The bandits, fearing that reinforcements would arrive after a long time, also rushed to snatch several bandit corpses and fled to Fenhu. At that time, Director Xu and Hang, the commander of the bandit suppression, were riding on the Zhiguo patrol ship in the Pinghu area. After hearing the news, they led their patrol ships and wooden shell gun teams to Jiashan overnight to pursue and suppress them. After receiving a telephone report from the Jiaxing district, the Inland River Water Police Bureau also sent the Gonghe patrol ship and the Shi Dai patrol team to the lake area along Jia overnight to search and suppress them.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The County Government Takes Over the Langshan Military Office:  The Ministry of Military Affairs appointed someone to investigate and found that the old Langshan General Military Office had been occupied by the people's Horse Hai Shan and ordered the county government to take it back for safekeeping and await disposal. On the 26th, County Magistrate Zhang ordered the Public Security Bureau to take over and keep it properly.</p>
<p>Reorganizing the Industry Police Team in the Tai District of Taizhou:  After the industry special police team in the coastal reclamation area of the Tai District of Taizhou in Huainan was disrupted by Ma Yuren colluding with bandits, most of the guns were robbed.

Finally, he was instructed to wrap the ocean in newspaper at 9 p.m. on the 25th and wait for collection. He was also told to put red paper on the door if he paid, and green paper if he refused. The Public Security Bureau and the Second Sub-Bureau in charge dispatched Inspector Gong Rongzhi and Patrol Officer He Ya to lead police officers to lie in ambush inside and outside the door and pretended to do as instructed. When someone arrived at the appointed time, they were chased and arrested by the bureau.

Lu Hanjun is one of the new famous generals in Shanghai, and his shot is powerful. Although Huang Jun resisted well, how could he last? The second pair was Yu Binqi against Chen Yinting. Yu is an old veteran of table tennis, and his skills are ordinary, but his experience is first-class. His hitting method is excellent. Chen is the Guangzhou individual champion, and his defeat to Yu was unexpected. The third pair was Lu Shentong against Mo Qinghuan. Lu is an athlete attending the Far East Games and is a famous general in Shanghai. His hitting method is unique, far to the opponent's table, and close to an inch over the net, making it unpredictable. Although Mo defended well, he felt overwhelmed and failed.

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Su Chen, Director of the Department of Education, Invited Ma Yinchu to Give a Lecture</h3>
<p>Titled "The Problem of Gold's Value Being High and Silver's Value Being Low"</p>
<p>Contemporary economics expert Ma Yinchu recently came to Zhenjiang as an examiner for the county magistrate examination. Chen Hexian, director of the Department of Education, believes that Ma has an absolute wealth of research on all practical economic problems. Recently, our country's society is feeling the pain of gold's value being high and silver's value being low. Ma has unique insights into this issue. Since it was a rare opportunity for Ma to stay in Zhenjiang, he specially invited Ma to give a public lecture in the auditorium of the Department of Education at 4 p.m. yesterday (the 26th). The lecture topic was "The Problem of Gold's Value Being High and Silver's Value Being Low." All sectors of society were welcome to participate. Those who came to listen to the lecture arrived in droves before 3 p.m., numbering no less than five or six hundred. Ma arrived at the Department of Education at 3:40 and entered the auditorium at 4:00. He was introduced by Director Chen, who also explained the necessity of inviting Ma to lecture on this important issue. Ma then took the stage to give a lecture, which lasted about two hours. He first described the reasons for the high value of gold and the low value of silver and their impact on China. Then, he criticized each of the relief methods proposed by various experts in recent days. Finally, he advocated using the gold standard to be consistent with the world in order to solve all problems. However, during this transition period, the gold standard is not easy to achieve. We should first adopt a virtual gold standard, that is, use silver domestically and gold externally and fix its exchange value. His words were full of vigilance, and every word was based on academic principles and in line with reality.</p>
<h3>Situation of Losses in Hunan Educational Institutions</h3>
<p>The Zhongshan Library Lost More Than One Million Yuan</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, the public and private losses caused by the recent intrusion, burning, looting, and killing by the Communist bandits in Hunan Province are huge. Detailed investigations are currently being conducted separately. Regarding educational institutions, the following have been verified by the Department of Education as belonging to the province: burning Zhongshan Library, Museum, Zhongshan Hall, Provincial Education Association, First Normal School Affiliated Elementary School, and destroying the Popular Education Hall, First Normal School, First Vocational School, First Middle School, Second Middle School, First Women's Vocational School, with losses of approximately several million yuan. Regarding private institutions, the following have been burned: Jianguo Law and Politics, Fuchu Middle School, Xinyi Middle School, and destroyed: Guangya, Fuxiang, Chengzhi, Guangyi, and other schools. As for other schools that were slightly damaged or suffered slight losses, there are countless others. Therefore, although the Department of Education plans to open the provincial schools on October 1, it is still difficult to determine whether they can be realized as scheduled due to lack of funds and the inability to repair the school sites. As for the private schools, if they do not open, the school sites must be stationed by the army, resulting in greater losses. They are all trying to find ways to prepare for the opening of schools, and at the same time, they are posting recruitment notices, but the tuition fees have been increased separately to make up for the losses. They have reported to the Department of Education for record. However, in order to make the Ministry of Education clearly understand the situation of the losses of the provincial educational institutions this time and the reasons for the delayed opening of each school, the Department of Education specially reported to the Ministry of Education for inspection. The text briefly states, "Unfortunately in Hunan Province, it was tragically invaded by Communist bandits in Changsha, burning and looting, and the sky and sun were dim. From July 27th, when the Communist bandits entered the city, to August 5th, when the provincial capital was recovered, it was found that the losses of all subordinate agencies and schools were no less than several million yuan. The files over the years have all been reduced to ashes. In addition, the Zhongshan Library Museum, Zhongshan Hall, and Provincial Education Association directly under its jurisdiction have all been burned without leaving any traces. Just taking the Zhongshan Library as an example, the collection of books and its plates are worth more than one million yuan. The instruments and specimens in the museum are estimated to be worth hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Popular Education Hall was only destroyed, and all the sundries, books, and printing machinery are also worth tens of thousands of yuan, which is relatively small. In addition, the Provincial First Normal School was completely destroyed, and the affiliated elementary school and the school's "part of the books, instruments, and educational supplies were burned and lost. The Provincial First Vocational School, First Middle School, Second Middle School, and First Women's Vocational School all suffered slight losses. It is fortunate that they were not destroyed." It has now been partially repaired and resumed office. Except for the Provincial First Normal School, which suffered greater losses and has a special situation that requires careful consideration, all provincial schools have to postpone the opening of school until October 1 due to tidying up the aftermath. The private schools were ordered to handle the opening of school in advance to avoid delaying their studies, and to inspect the remaining files that were burned. Fearing that only one out of ten would be obtained, all the orders issued by the Ministry of Education and the investigation forms, as well as the original copy that had been submitted, are requested to be copied separately by each department and section and submitted to the hall for compliance, so that they can be followed."

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Thinking of the Most Effective and Economical Way for the Study Abroad Community</h3>
<p>(Wu Xiexun)</p>
<p>Having traveled to various advanced countries around the world, such as the United States, England, and France, I often see that Chinese students are the most numerous. This inevitably leads to a feeling that why are there so many Chinese students in other countries, and what is their efficiency compared to students from other countries? The reason for this is simply that our government has not yet had the time to establish large-scale academic research institutions to accommodate those who have already received higher education in the country, so they have no choice but to go abroad en masse. Furthermore, due to the social emphasis on students who have studied abroad, they are inevitably driven by vanity, which reduces their efficiency in seeking knowledge. This is also what people with lofty ideals are most heartbroken about and must urgently seek to remedy. I believe that the current plan should be to have China establish its own research institutes to provide university students with research opportunities. On the other hand, given the backwardness of education and the decline of academics in our country today, research guidance must still borrow talent from foreign countries. It is still appropriate to invite foreign experts in various fields to come to China to guide research. As for the implementation methods, the money used to send students abroad can be used to invite foreign professors, so there is no need to worry about a lack of funds. Other aspects, such as the construction of school buildings, should strive for grandeur in scale, and the arrangement and equipment within the school should strive for perfection. The expenses can be sought from the return of the Boxer indemnity funds. I believe that friendly countries will be happy to comply. As for studying abroad, absolute emphasis should be placed on practical training. It would be best to change students studying abroad to practical trainees. Only after academic research is completed should the government's competent authorities negotiate with friendly countries to introduce and entrust them with practical training opportunities. This method has been implemented by our naval authorities for the purpose of cultivating naval talent. It is not only for navigation; I believe that this is the most effective and economical way to cultivate any kind of specialized technical talent. If it is absolutely necessary for the sake of facilitating practical opportunities, it may be possible to agree with various friendly countries that, for example, those built with funds returned by the United States should be used exclusively for the study of American academic disciplines, and American professors should be invited to teach them, and the United States should be asked to provide practical opportunities in the future. The same applies to England and Japan. As for whether this method has any drawbacks and whether it can be implemented, it should be decided by experts. I humbly ask the wise men of the country what they think. If you do not consider my words to be nonsensical, then please gather experts and organize a group to jointly research and implement a plan to strive for realization. At least the following benefits can be obtained: (1) The number of talents cultivated will be smaller, which can reduce the sigh of regret; (2) The talents cultivated will be more practical, which can avoid the drawbacks of pursuing vanity; (3) The ideas and academic disciplines will be more suitable for the current situation in China, so that there will be no criticism of cutting one's feet to fit the shoes; (4) Having such a large-scale, well-equipped institution of higher learning will enhance our prestige and increase our international standing. The magnitude of the benefits cannot be enumerated. As for this returned indemnity fund, there was a previous proposal to use it exclusively for transportation. Building transportation is certainly an urgent task for today, but building specialized talent to build the foundation for a new China is an urgent task within an urgent task. Our wise transportation authorities should also be willing to allocate a portion of it to complete this great plan of national construction, which will not only benefit the study abroad community. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be effectively addressed by a junior scholar like Xiexun. It is hoped that famous figures and academic leaders in the country will jointly call for it, so that it can gradually be achieved.</p>

<p>Mr. Li Zhongshi was from Zhongshan. He was a stalwart member of the Nationalist Party. He was intelligent, courageous, loyal, and honest, with extraordinary boldness and insight. He followed the Premier for many years, offering counsel and assistance, and working as hard as the martyr Liao Zhongkai. Mr. Li engaged in revolutionary work with loyalty and diligence, disregarding personal gain. Therefore, Mr. Li's name has not been widely recognized. In the spring of the Xinhai year, he and comrades such as Hu Hanmin and Liao Zhongkai disguised themselves and secretly resided in Beijing. Taking advantage of an opportunity, they ambushed Zai Dun. He fought bravely alone, disregarding his own safety. However, he was outnumbered and unable to achieve his great ambition. Mr. Li was able to defend himself and leave Beijing, which was due to his extraordinary intelligence. In the autumn of the tenth year of the Republic, Mr. Li came to Shanghai on official business. At that time, an epidemic was prevalent in Shanghai. Due to overwork, he fell ill and remained in his residence. Mr. Li had always been averse to medicine. His family tried to persuade him to take it, but he refused. He sighed and said, "I have been running around for half my life, and the revolution has not yet succeeded. A great man's life and death are predestined. People eat grains. Who can avoid illness? Why rely on these herbs?" At that time, friends and relatives gathered and urged him to take Western medicine. Mr. Li firmly refused. Because of friendship, I rushed to Shanghai the next day to see him, but Mr. Li had already passed away. At that time, the warlords were in power, and the overall situation was uncertain. Therefore, he was buried in the International Cemetery. Yesterday, I passed by the side of the grave and saw Mr. Li's tomb green and lush, and I lingered there for a long time. Alas, Mr. Li died for public service, and his achievements were no less than those of other martyrs, but his heroic name has not yet been recognized. Is it that Heaven has deprived us of this talent? Or is it not yet the time for mourning? Reflecting on the past and thinking of the present, how can I not be sad? I have briefly recorded a few words to serve as an aid to revolutionary history.</p>
<h3>Lamenting Xie Jiezi</h3>
<p>— Jing Mengdie</p>
<p>The Xie brothers were both talented, and Gongzhan, Jiezi. His fame has been known in Shanghai for a long time. I had the honor of befriending him, which began in the autumn of Wuchen. When Jiezi came to Xishan to recuperate at the Meiyuan, he was actually introduced by two lyrics. In fact, we had been acquainted in spirit for several years. Before this, I had published two lyrics in Free Talk, which were works about appreciating chrysanthemums at the Lanling Chrysanthemum Society. The wise brothers saw them and praised them greatly. They recorded the manuscript and searched for the person everywhere. Therefore, when Jiezi arrived in Xishan, he was as happy as an old friend at first sight. There was a reason for this. Mr. Xishen's "Record of Autumn Boating on the Five Lakes" praised this section of writing's缘分 (yúanfèn, the concept of fate or destiny bringing people together), even comparing it to the story of Suiyuan and Hongxuelou. To me, who was at the end of my road and felt like I had found a confidant, it was no less than the knowledge of Yuzhou by the North Sea. Jiezi lived in Meiyuan for half a year, enjoying singing and poetry. He often visited or invited me for wine. We improvised sentences based on the scenery. We once compiled the works of singing and response into a book called "Taibo Yinxiao Lu". On good days in spring and autumn, he and Gongzhan repeatedly invited painters and calligraphers from Shanghai, as well as famous figures from the press, such as Li Haoran and Zhou Shoujuan, to tour Xishan in succession. The grand occasion of the feasts and singing at that time can be seen in newspaper reports. After we parted last year, we hadn't seen each other for a long time. Jiang Yun and Wei Shu were very homesick, and it was precisely because of this that Jiezi suddenly arrived this spring on the third day of the third month. Therefore, we went together to repair the禊 (xì, a ritual purification) at Meiyuan. An old friend was well, and visiting the old place again was a joy to behold. I immediately wrote an article to record this. Alas, who would have known that this reunion would be a farewell for eternity? At the beginning of the month, I was tied up in my hometown due to work. I returned to Xishan recently, and the bad news came, and I was shocked. Suddenly went to Xiuwen. I am ashamed to have failed my dead friend. The grief of death is hard to bear. Moreover, Cai Nu is still young and unable to take over her father's business. Xu Qi is writing a sacrifice to her husband. If your soul knows, it should not rest. Is there a more tragic history in the world than this? And Gongzhan's deep brotherly love, his grief can be imagined. Therefore, I wrote two poems to lament him, saying: Vaguely, the Er Lu broadcast their voices and glory. Little Xie's talent has been praised at sea. He has a special relationship with famous scholars in poetry and wine. He has spent the home of his illness in the lakes and mountains. Zhongxuan's body is weak and he is still a visitor. Changji's heart is as hard as blood and flowers. The tragic and handsome tour has become a separate world. The old rain of the Huanglu feels the end of the world. The two words "pity talent" feel the deepest. When I look back at the old friends, I feel the pain of losing my lyre. The chrysanthemum lyrics of Shuangsheng invite Qingyan. Ten thousand plum blossoms tie a vegetarian heart. Yuandu has repeatedly passed away and still cherishes parting. Once Zhong Qi leaves, there will be few confidants. The Ronghu has a guest who summons his soul. The autumn wind and snowy tears entrust the bitter song.</p>
<h3>Strange Plants</h3>
<p>— Shouyang</p>
<p>I was a guest in Chengang, near March. I came back the other day. My wife told me that her cousin Chen Binru's family had a plant growing next to the rockery in the backyard of his residence during the fourth month of the lunar calendar. It is shaped like a buttercup, about four feet high. The leaves are long and wide, with serrated edges. The color is reddish brown. Flowers bloom in the leaf axils, either purple or white, with spots on them. The petals are double and divided into seven lobes. The flowers that have bloomed and the buds that are about to bloom all hang down like trinkets. A slight breeze blows, like a light dance of colorful butterflies. However, the flower stalks have yellow whiskers and a very strong, strange fragrance. It cannot be immediately dissipated from the sense of smell. The Qi people have invited flower lovers to visit and admire it. However, none of the viewers can recognize the name of the flower. This is truly a strange plant. I have written this down to facilitate the research of plant experts in the country.</p>
<h3>Record of the Public Banquet for the Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Group</h3>
<p>— Zhao Dingming</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Pilgrimage Group has been in Shanghai from Beijing for a little over a month. They are about to depart now. At 12:00 AM on the 24th, the Yousheng Travel Group, the Oriental Book Publishing House, and the World Buddhist Layman's Forest held a public banquet at Jueyuan on Hart Road in western Shanghai. In addition to the group leader, Tican, and the deputy group leader, Beiguan, of the Buddhist Pilgrimage Group, the attendees included the two monks Zhanran and Minghui, who had recently joined in Shanghai. Wei Juezhong, who had just come from Southeast Asia and planned to travel the world freely, and Yang Yuzhen, who had just arrived in Shanghai from India with the aim of traveling around the world, were also present. It is not easy to meet people from all over the world. Is this what is meant by having a缘份 (yúanfèn, the concept of fate or destiny bringing people together) with Buddhism? Soon after, Liu Yuqi, Song Peidao, and Ni Ruping, representatives of Yousheng, and Fafang, a representative of the Buddhist Layman's Forest, as well as guests Tian Chuqiao, Lin Liexuan, and others, arrived one after another. Then, everyone gathered under the pool heart凉亭 (liángtíng, a type of traditional Chinese pavilion usually built by the water) for a photo shoot, returned to the Great Hall of the Buddhist Association, and sat down for tea. There were fifteen guests and hosts, divided into two tables. After the vegetarian feast was served, the meeting began. (1) The three groups jointly elected Huang Jingwan to deliver a speech on behalf of the group. He said, "Buddhists in modern times are almost regarded as corrupt elements. I hope that the Buddhist group will reform with modern monks. I also hope that the group will be consistent from beginning to end and not retreat in the face of difficulties." He also cited the facts of travelers in ancient and modern times to encourage them. (2) Beiguan's reply, in addition to expressing gratitude on behalf of the group, was to describe the situation of departing from Beijing. "Our group of five set off from Beijing on July 30th and arrived in Tianjin on August 2nd. Minyan Daily and Ta Kung Pao both had the same expressions as the various newspapers in Shanghai. Minyan Daily said that our group was "a new activity of young Buddhists." Our group was extremely excited. At the same time, we want to thank all the gentlemen who supported our group. Even those who oppose our group should also be thanked, because they can increase our perseverance. We will promote and glorify Shakyamuni's compassion on this trip. We will also offer the Buddha's relics obtained in foreign countries to the Buddhist community so as not to fail the kindness of the three groups and all the gentlemen." (3) Mr. Lin Liexuan gave a speech, saying, "I am not a Buddhist, nor have I ever studied Buddhism. However, I feel that there are no real monks today. Only Tang Xuanzang in ancient times was a real monk. I have traveled all over the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, and the icy and snowy, steep cliffs are chilling everywhere. It can be seen that it was not easy for Xuanzang to go to India alone to obtain scriptures and return to the country to translate them. And his people are worthy of admiration." He also said, "I deeply hope that the masters of the Buddhist Pilgrimage Group will" learn Buddhism on the one hand, work on the other hand, become a monk on the one hand, and enter the world to work on the other hand. We must reform Buddhism with a scientific attitude," and so on. Others such as Yang Yuzhen and Wei Juezhong also gave sincere speeches. It is a pity that the two gentlemen have been in Southeast Asia for a long time and speak Cantonese, which is not easy to understand. However, the general idea is to hope that the group will not just talk about empty words and must practice in person. They also explained the experiences and purposes of their travels. After the banquet, representatives of each group signed their names one after another. Shi Tican took out the publicity materials from Beijing to Shanghai and showed them to everyone for viewing. Among them, Master Taixu sent a letter of admonition from the summer resort in Putuo, saying, "With perseverance, take on the work of hardship, and you must persevere in order to achieve your goal. You must have real achievements before you can gain people's trust and admiration. You must not make boastful words in advance and retreat in the face of difficulties. This is essential." After viewing the materials, all the guests sighed at the group's second Buddhist purpose and hoped that they would abide by it. After signing their names, the Venerable Fafang led the guests to visit the clear, green, and quiet Jueyuan. Mr. Hu Bozhou from the East took many more photos and then everyone dispersed.</p>
<h3>Analysis of the Recent Political Turmoil in Germany (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Li Liuzeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>The German election campaign, which began immediately after the announcement of the dissolution of the parliament, is also an interesting study. After the Brühning cabinet dissolved the parliament, it issued a proclamation to the German people, in which it raised a question that voters should answer in the September 14 election. This question was, "In order to maintain financial order, to maintain the German economy, and to maintain all social undertakings, are the German people willing to reject the measures that the government deems necessary?" Regardless of whether the tax increase plan is necessary, people always feel the pain of tax increases. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the government's question will receive a satisfactory answer in the election. Moreover, the left and right wings, which are in opposition to the government, will inevitably use this question to exert their propaganda skills on the people. Reactionary parties, such as the racial party led by Hitler and the nationalist party of Xiao Zhenbai, will also take the opportunity to wait for changes and try to create a new trend favorable to their party in the desperate situation. In addition, the Communist Party will also make activities by taking advantage of the widespread unease caused by this economic change and the suffering of the majority of workers caused by unemployment. As for the Social Democratic Party, it is in a relatively superior position in front of the voters. However, it is also difficult to win a greater victory than in May 1929. The most unfavorable thing is that countless small parties, such as the Democratic Party, the Catholic Party, the Civilian Party, and the softened nationalist parties, are in the midst of the two major trends of the extreme left and the extreme right. There is a danger of being swallowed up and eliminated.</p>
<p>There is another noteworthy thing in the current German political situation, which is the interest of President Hindenburg in the election to be held on September 14. President Hindenburg has personally participated in the political war, such as the temporary establishment of the Brühning cabinet, the intervention in the "Iron Helmet" incident, the promulgation of the new tax law in accordance with Article 48 of the Constitution, and finally the dissolution of the parliament to maintain the Brühning cabinet, which had failed twice in the parliament. If the result of the election on September 14 is not favorable to the government, then President Hindenburg's position will be deeply difficult in the future. And to what extent will the political change unfold? No one dares to predict. What we urgently want to know now is whether the German people will turn to the left in the future, or to the right, or will they allow this chaotic political situation to continue for a while? At this time, everyone feels the pain of the death of former Foreign Minister Stresemann, which was a huge loss for Germany. After the European War, only Stresemann was able to support the precarious situation and lead the German people out of the water and fire and into the position of being comfortable.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (264)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Plants Fortune and Gets a Diamond Ring? Only This Fate Inspires a Song of Golden Threads</p>
<p>Chan Nong said, "Yesterday, I originally asked Second Young Master Zuo to come to have dinner. Today, my younger brother happened to send two baskets of crabs. Therefore, I specially asked the accountant to write an invitation and send it to your newspaper office. Did you receive it?" Zuo Shichen said, "Yes, I received it. I remember that every time lake crabs came into season, your father would personally send them over." Chan Nong said, "My father passed away three years ago. Only a stepmother is left at home, and my brother is also adopted. I am now alone and without relatives." At that time, he instructed the servant, "Auntie, go pick the crabs. Are the vinegar and ginger dishes ready?" Then he paired male and female crabs and said, "Second Young Master, have you eaten ten?" Our Yangcheng clear water crabs only have two per pound." Zuo Shichen said, "Such big crabs are impossible to eat ten of. At most, I can eat four." Chan Nong said, "Not enough, not enough... Then boil eight. The other day, I heard a guest say that there was a former Qing dynasty governor, Li Da, who could eat a hundred crabs in one go. People called him Li Hundred Crabs. His crab consumption was considered large. How come you can't even eat ten crabs?" Zuo Shichen said, "Yes, I also heard people say that Mr. Li Meian could eat a hundred crabs, and even his wife could eat twenty or so. But it was just hearsay, not seen with my own eyes, so I dared not believe it was true. Generally, at least several dozen crabs can be eaten, but it depends on the size of the crabs and cannot be generalized. Your crabs here are so big that even Li Hundred Crabs might not have such a large capacity." After a while, a large crystal plate was brought in, steaming with a large plate of bright red crabs. Zuo Shichen said to Chan Nong, "Why don't you join me?" Chan Nong said, "My stomach is not well, I dare not eat. I'll help you peel them." He also asked someone to pour a glass of brandy. While holding the crab and drinking wine, Zuo Shichen slowly asked why she came out. Chan Nong sighed and said, "As the saying goes, 'It's better to be a bird than someone else's little one.' Being someone else's concubine is never a good business. It's a long story, let me tell you slowly. Having tasted this bitterness, I am now determined not to marry." Zuo Shichen said, "What if you don't marry? I advise you to take advantage of the fact that you are not too old and marry an honest and sincere person. As the ancient poem says, 'I urge you not to begrudge your gold-embroidered garments, but to cherish your youth.' For example, even the most exquisite clothes can be easily remade if they are torn. But a person's youth is gone and never returns. Time flies, and many people waste their youth. By the time they turn around, they are already old and regretful. This means 'If you don't work hard when you are young, you will regret it when you are old.' What meaning is there in the brothel? It is precisely:</p>
<p>Do not greedily linger in the pleasure quarters,</p>
<p>Only to lament the lateness of the hour and resent the Eastern Emperor."</p>

<p>The Gold Market Remains Unpredictable</p>
<p>Advancing and retreating without any rhythm. Yesterday, the changes in the gold standard on the 27th were still hesitant, sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating, with a meandering pace. Throughout the day, there was a total fluctuation of ten taels, with a slight setback seen. The attitude of the industry was subtly panicky. As for the exchange rate, there was not much disparity, and the listed price has been reduced by half a grade. Brokers on and off the table occasionally made transactions, but without much volume. In the early market, it was initially weak, with fluctuations of three or four taels. The silver price was slightly lower and remained unaffected. Later, when buyers saw movement, the exchange rate seemed to rise, and thus it flourished. It rose sharply from 561.52 taels to 571 taels. However, investors rose one after another, and it has already been replaced. However, the market situation was still fluctuating, and trading in the late market became increasingly rare. As it was Wednesday, the exchange rate was typically sluggish, resulting in a mediocre situation. Afterwards, within 65 taels, the large bars of silver all shrank back by 3/16, and the silver price fell by 1/2.</p>
<p>The early market changed repeatedly. The opening gold price for October fell by three taels to 563.8 taels, and then increased from 563.3 taels to 566.5 taels, probably because of uneven trading and unstable sentiment. Later, Xin Heng and others sold, suddenly falling more than five taels, eventually dropping to 561 taels. However, it immediately rose two or three taels, and various firms eagerly bought in. Moreover, recently, British gold banks have been trading in and out, doing 7 pence 125. When the advance rate was announced, it had been reduced by 125, the US dollar was reduced by 25 cents, and the Japanese gold was increased by 75, with it then standing at 566.34 taels. However, at this time, there were still not few short positions being sold, and it has retreated to 563.5 taels. Soon, there was still broad buying interest in bank exchange rates. Markar &amp; Co. initially bought November 7 pence 375, and later only ate in 25, and even Yuan Xing Yong, Yong Feng, etc., bought silver bars, so they immediately saw sharp profits, reaching 571 taels after 10 o'clock. Afterwards, Su Kang Run Yong Cheng Chang and others sold a lot, and the British gold seemed weak. October could be traded at 7 pence 1875, so it got worse and worse, and the sharp momentum was stimulated. Until 11:00, it was suppressed by six or seven taels, only about 564 taels. In an instant, Yuan Xing Yong, Yong Feng, etc. took the opportunity to buy in, again crossing the 570 taels mark, totaling 570.02 taels. After 11:30, selling pressure continued, unable to support it, and it plunged by as much as seven or eight taels, totaling 562.5 taels, and immediately increased to 565.45 taels. In short, the market situation was so confusing that it was impossible to speculate. The noon close was 565.3 taels, and the listed price has been changed to 630.06 taels. Japanese gold was quoted at a high of 75, and the morning price was a low of 64.5 taels, later only suppressed at 60 taels, and the noon closing was still at a low of 65.6 taels.</p>
<p>The late market was quiet. The afternoon opening was at 65 taels, then falling to 63.2 taels. Retailers sold, and it recovered by more than two taels, totaling 65.67 taels. After a while, it retreated to 63.34 taels. As the Indian exchange rate telegram showed growth, after 2:30, it seemed to tend towards peace, with only one or two taels of twists and turns. As it was Wednesday, there was no market for the various exchange rates, so the transactions of the various firms were also minimal. Around 4:00, it rose to 65.5 taels, then immediately retreated to 64.6 taels. The market closed at 4:30 at 64.9 taels, a drop of 1.9 taels compared to the previous day. The maximum price for the day was 71 taels, and the minimum was 61 taels, a fluctuation of 10 taels. The listed price was quoted at 66 taels, and the registered price was from 76 taels to 65 taels. The total volume of transactions before and after the morning and afternoon sessions was 76 taels. The price of goods in the early market was 63.5 taels, 64.5 taels in the afternoon, and the closing price in the afternoon was 64 taels.</p>
<p>Transactions were mostly fractional amounts. The transactions of the various firms were uncertain. Yu Feng Yong, Yuan Xing Yu, Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Mao Yong, Shun Li, Wan Xing, etc. generally bought more than they sold. Da De Cheng, Yu Da, Yuan Cheng, Fu Chang, Heng Xing, etc. opened and closed, Yuan Xing Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, and Yong Feng sold and then bought back. Yong Heng, Yong Cheng Chang, Yi Feng Yong, and Tai Kang Run all sold. In the afternoon, Yuan Mao Yong and retailers bought in, while Wan Xing, Shun Li, and Tai Kang Run all sold out. Other firms had no large transactions. The Dalian gang bought in 1,600-1,700 silver bars, and sold out 1,400-1,500. The Guangdong gang traded about 2,000 silver bars in total, roughly breaking even.</p>

<h3>Interest Market Weakens Then Strengthens</h3>
<p>Market Overview: The market price of foreign interest in this month has been hovering outside of 9%. Although it once reached 30%, it was a flash in the pan and disappeared instantly, and it has never fallen below 9%. The day before yesterday, it suddenly fell out of the range, and this morning it was even lower. People generally thought that it could be expected to shrink from now on. Contrary to yesterday afternoon, the sentiment suddenly showed strength, rising by 0.5%, and still reaching its original position, because the selling market was smooth again and the situation turned better. As for the trend of the silver market, the voice is very small, and it is probably difficult to expect a good situation.</p>
<p>Interest Dismantling Price (Foreign Interest): The morning interest rate was 7 qian 2 fen 8 li 5 hao, which was a little more than 1 hao 2 hu smaller than the previous day.

(Silver Dismantling): The silver market is currently loose, and there is no hope of rising for a long time. It always opens at 2 fen every day.

<h3>Securities: The Settlement Period is Approaching, and the Bond Market is Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>The August term has been suspended and only the September term is being traded.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose first and then fell, continuing to show slight weakness compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the August futures of public bonds were preparing for the settlement of accounts and were suspended from trading first. Therefore, only the September term market was trading, and the market was preparing for the settlement of the market transactions, so it was extremely quiet. As for the changes in bond prices, although there were few sales in the early morning, retailers were buying in, causing the September futures for customs duties, disarmament, and demobilization to recover slightly compared to the previous day. However, as the buying momentum also turned quiet, it still fell back, resulting in a continued slight decline compared to the previous day. Statistics show that only 5,700 yuan of spot goods and 5.2 million of futures were traded throughout the day.</p>

<h3>The Securities Exchange Will Start Trading 19-Year Cigarette Vouchers</h3>
<p>Trading will begin on September 1st.</p>
<p>The Securities Exchange announced yesterday that it will start trading the current futures of the 19-year cigarette warehouse vouchers starting on September 1st. The 19-year cigarettes were issued on April 1st of this year, with a total amount of 24 million yuan, to be paid off in 36 months, with one payment of principal and interest each month. The interest rate is 8%, and the interest decreases with the principal. The futures transaction of every 10,000 yuan requires a special voucher of 800 yuan and a principal voucher of 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market is Still in a Stable Process</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly firm, but the sentiment in the three-grade yarn market has turned weak, so some people are indifferent. The Chaozhou gang's intention to sell short is still strong. As for the buyer's attitude, it is extremely firm, and the long and short sides are in a stalemate again. Currently, the sales of yarn to the Sichuan gang are healthier. According to Japanese merchants' surveys, the bottom stock of yarn has increased again. The future trend depends on the actual needs.</p>
<p>People's Bidding: Buyers are Strong. In the early market of the People's Bidding, due to the good trend of foreign cotton, the sentiment was firm, and each month rose by 40-50 cents. The second and third sessions fell slightly, and the result was that each month rose by 3, 4, 5, and 7 cents. In the afternoon, the short positions for the current month were covered and the far-end positions moved up, with each month rising by 1, 2, 3, and 4 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 22,850 bales. It was found that Yuan Tai sold 1,200 bales, Sui Feng 1,200 bales, Ji Feng 1,400 bales, Han Feng 600 bales, Heng Da 700 bales, and Mei Ji He Shen Yi Yu Yi Chang Shen Xin Shen Ji Tian Chang Yong Chang 350 to 550 bales. Tian Long bought 1,600 bales, Rui Da 1,800 bales, Li Chang 1,200 bales, Yu Kang Tai Xing Xin Cheng Yu Da Da Ji Tai Sheng Kang Rong Xing Yi Cheng 300 to 600 bales. The closing prices of the People's Bidding are listed on the left: People's Bidding Closing Prices, Increases and Decreases, Account Balances: November: 1557, Up 7, 38,900, August: 1578, Up 10, 11,700, December: 1550, Up 5, 26,800, September: 1565, Up 6, 24,200, January: 1551, Up 4, 18,800, October: 1569, Up 5, 41,600</p>
<p>The Sichuan Gang Bought 1,000 Bales of Spot Goods: The sales of spot yarn are more active. Statistics show that each gang bought a total of 2,040 bales throughout the day. 275 bales were entered among peers, and the market was slightly firm. Among the visiting gangs, Sichuan entered 1,000 bales, the interior entered 210 bales, Xuzhou entered 260 bales, Wuhu entered 80 bales, Tianjin entered 130 bales, Guangdong entered 265 bales, and miscellaneous gangs entered 100 bales.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Gradually Coming to Life</h3>
<p>The cotton market is stable. Due to the rebound in US cotton, the amount managed by the manager has been reduced. However, the Han gang sold 7,100 dan when the price rose, and there were also many people covering short positions, so the market situation was tighter. However, the large short position holders are still calm and have no intention of covering their positions, due to the favorable weather this year and the good production conditions of the new cotton. The price of the new cotton thrown in by various factories is 32.5 taels for the same type of fire machine cotton, which is cheaper and sent to the factories. However, foreign cotton has recently rebounded, and there are few new sellers. Retailers are buying in, and the market atmosphere is naturally returning. Subsequent steps still depend on the fluctuations of US cotton.</p>
<p>The Han Bidding Closing Price is Flat. In the early market of the Han Bidding, the market was firm due to foreign cotton. Rui Da and Japanese merchants covered short positions, and the market atmosphere became tighter. Each month rose by 30 cents. The opening situation in the afternoon was sharp, and each rose by 15 cents. Later, due to the large-scale sales by the Han gang, the market atmosphere was flat. The closing price was affected by the decline in the three-grade yarn and cotton in Osaka, and the selling trend was strong again, with each month falling back. The result was flat, with not much fluctuation. The total transaction volume for the day was 49,100 dan. It was found that Rui Da bought 8,600 dan, Chang Feng 4,400 dan, Chang Ji Gong Tai Yuan De Yi Yu Tian Chang Yuan Da Tian Long Tai Xing Shen Ji 1,900 dan to 800 dan. Shen Chang sold 7,100 dan, Heng Yi 2,500 dan, Xie Sheng 1,900 dan, Mao Ji Tong Yu Yu Da Rong Xing Yuan Tai Yong Feng Sen Kang Yi Chang Yi Cheng Yuan Da 800 dan to 1,100 dan. The closing prices of the Han Bidding are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Han Bidding Closing Price: Increase/Decrease, Account Balance: December: 33.20, Up 30, 81,900, October: 32.95, Up 30, 86,200, January: 33.30, 30, 98,900, November: 33.20, 35, 104,600</p>
<p>Spot Goods and Factory Offices are Moving Frequently. The new cotton from various factories is gradually becoming active, but the intake is flat and the amount per package is extremely small. The source is 420 packages of Tao Yao cotton, and new fire machine cotton is 32.50. Shen Xin Factory entered 1,000 packages in September.</p>
<p>New Taicang Cotton 33.25, Shen Xin Factory entered 2,000 packages in November and December and 33.50.</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 32.75, Shanghai Factory entered 1,000 pieces, and 33.75 again.</p>
<p>33.25 again, Feng Tian Factory entered 400 pieces, and 4.25 was delivered to the factory in October and November.</p>
<p>33.25 again, Shen Xin Factory entered 200 pieces, and spot fire machine cotton 34.00, Zhen Xin Factory entered 200 packages, and it was delivered to Wuxi now.</p>
<h3>The World's Yarn and Cotton are Becoming Increasingly Firm</h3>
<p>US Cotton Rose Another 30 Points. Yesterday, US cotton initially rose due to good news from Liverpool. Later, due to the offsetting of fixed accounts and reactive buying, the market situation became increasingly firm. Futures rose by 27 to 32 points, and spot goods rose by 30 points. British cotton futures rose by 20 to 21 points, and spot goods rose by 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose with US cotton, but later the sentiment in the market was questionable and buyers were enthusiastic, and the market situation continued to be firm. Ping Char rose by 5 rupees, Ormra rose by 8 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 7 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated 26th):</p>

The 20-count Red God of Wealth was 138 yuan, up 2 yuan, equivalent to 189.8 taels in Shanghai standard. The 16-count Fukushima was 128 yuan, up 1 yuan, equivalent to 176 taels. The 16-count Three Horses was 127 yuan, up 2 yuan, equivalent to 174.6 taels in Shanghai standard.</p>
<h3>Grains: The Rice Market in Hexia is Plummeting</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the sources continued to arrive, and the market interest became more sluggish. The broken japonica rice from the North Gang was also weak by 20 cents, and the downward trend did not stop. The market form was still weak. Top-grade japonica rice was generally around 20 yuan, but high-quality goods in the Central Customs were only 19 yuan. The speed of the turnaround was unexpected. The Eastern Xin japonica rice was difficult to stand, and it was also half a yuan short, with the highest being only 17 yuan. The Southern Gang's thin indica rice also suffered a setback, and the market price hovered around 20 yuan. The source of new guest rice was becoming more prosperous, and the goods were better than before. Therefore, although it was still 13.7-8 yuan on the surface, it actually had to be discounted by 20-30 cents. The white yuan high and fixed grades were cut, and the higher market form was slightly stable, while the middle and lower grades continued to decline.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: A small amount of goods arrived from Hexia, and the sales were flat. The North japonica rice was facing a deteriorating situation in the North Market, and everyone was pessimistic, so the market price was observed and adjusted by 20 cents. The lower and middle grades of japonica rice from the Su Tong Gang were scarce and inquired about, so the market price had no standard. The overall trend was extremely weak. Scattered boats of thin early indica rice from the South Road were still arriving, and the route was very poor. Although the market price had been shortened, there were no buyers asking, and the transactions were minimal. The price of new japonica rice was the same as the price in the North, and the change in yuan was stable, with the overall market at 18.2-3 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market is Falling in the Near Term and Rising in the Long Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened, each month remained stable. The current month saw some scattered long positions return, and most of the long positions also paused slightly due to some concerns. The market was slightly flatter. The market from September onwards was inquired about by customers, and the market form was tighter. Moreover, it was widely rumored in the market that the Tianjin shipping ban had been opened due to a proper advance payment, so people were more optimistic about the distant future. The closing price was up 1.25 yuan in September, up 1 yuan in December, up 7.5 cents in October, up 0.5 cents in November, and up 0.5 cents in January. The current month was down 0.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures: Bullish Momentum Gradually Softens</h3>
<p>Morning: Determined Buying of Spot Goods Causes a Surge... Afternoon: Covert Selling Causes a Slight Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened, the spot month experienced determined buying by bulls and capitulation by bears. The market seemed to gather momentum and suddenly surged to 5.29 taels per unit. Distant months, lacking new bullish drivers, remained similar to the previous day's closing. After the second session in the afternoon, some bulls were already covertly selling off several lots. Additionally, dealers from Changshu, Wuxi, and Suzhou secretly sold approximately 20 lots, immediately breaking the market's buying momentum. The spot month fell from 5.27 taels to close at 5.18 taels, a decrease of 0.03 taels compared to the previous day's close and a drop of 0.11 taels from the day's high. Distant months remained unchanged, with only September rising by 0.01 taels and January falling by 0.01 taels. The remaining months saw no change. Existing wheat factories have good demand, and bears are also buying to cover their short positions, but the arrival of goods is very limited, especially high-quality goods. As a result, over 9,000 bags were offered, and prices rose by another 0.06 to 0.07 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: New York Sugar Suddenly Rises</h3>
<p>Spot Raw Dutch Sugar Opens Higher by 0.05</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market communications from production areas reported the spot price of Cuban sugar remained at 1.125. New York sugar futures for September were priced at 1.11, up 0.05 from the previous communication; December at 1.24; and March and May of next year at 1.36 and 1.44 respectively, each rising sharply by 0.07. The spot price of Javanese sugar was 8.875, with September futures at 8.625 and October at 8.5625, unchanged from previous levels. In the exchange market, transactions for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar were sparse, but the market appeared quite firm. Ordinary goods were marked at 7.9 taels, high-quality goods at 7.95 taels; slightly damp sugar at 7.85 taels; No. 20 medium granulated white sugar at 7.7 taels; finely ground white sugar at 8.05 taels; the market was generally firm. Due to very limited arrivals of Japanese sugar and limited production from the Minghua factory, coupled with thin inventories, the market was lively. N-mark was priced up to 7.95 taels, with demand exceeding supply, and expectations of an increase to 8 taels in the future. J-mark at 8.15 taels also faced shortages. SH-mark rose to 7.825 taels, with a generally strong market. Minghua YRP-mark at 7.7 taels, YT-mark at 7.85 taels, and YP-mark at 7.975 taels were relatively stable. Spot medium granulated white sugar inventories were very thin. Huaxin Company opened over a thousand bags yesterday, priced at 7.6 taels, high-quality goods at 7.7 taels, with the market still appearing robust. Huaxin Company initially offered 3,000 bags of spot goods and continued to offer several hundred bags yesterday, with prices rising by 0.05 taels. Although demand was somewhat slack, the market still exhibited signs of stability.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Factory Prices Report a Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>Overseas Telegrams Not Relayed... Silk Sales Remain Stagnant</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local foreign firm silk market was lifeless. Silk mills in Europe and America are cutting production or halting operations due to economic factors, greatly reducing demand for raw silk. Although overseas silk prices have reported sharp declines, silk telegrams are still not relayed to Shanghai, resulting in a subdued market. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson only imported 10 bales of Hai Shen brand top-grade No. 13-15 strands Shanghai white factory silk, priced at 985 taels, a drop of dozens of taels. The outlook for the silk market remains pessimistic.</p>
<h3>Wuyuan Premium Tea Exports Show Slight Movement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, high-grade Zhen Mei tea from Wuyuan, from Baochang Yongxing and other firms, were purchased several hundred boxes due to telegrams received from foreign countries. However, the price was 110-120 taels, which is lower than before by 10-20 taels. With the oversupply of famous teas in the market, it seems difficult for the market to improve. Public expectations are for the assistance of the Russian Association, but the arrest of Russians in Hankou led to its closure. Yesterday, a telegram from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce stated that they had been released, raising hopes of reviving the Russian sales of Chinese goods.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fine Twill Fabric Reaches Its Peak</h3>
<p>Local Cotton Cloth: Yesterday, fine twill fabric was the strongest, reaching its peak. Local mills cannot meet demand, and spot goods are in short supply. Yesterday, the Guangdong merchants bought large quantities, further strengthening market sentiment. Yanghe crane was sold at the high price of 7.225 taels, Lan Shuangyu wood at 8.75 taels. Dieqiu Feixiong Songshu has all been bought up by Guangdong merchants. However, fine cloth was slightly weak: Yanghe trumpet boy at 6.9 taels, Lan Shuangyu Caiqiu at 6.95 taels. Housheng Lanji Renqiang sold over 200 pieces in dye factory batches yesterday, priced at 6.5 taels. Coarse cloth "Tian Zi" rose 0.01 taels, opening at 7.85 taels. 9-pound cloth was consistently sold at 4.2 taels, and 11-pound cloth at 4.7 taels.</p>
<p>East-West Piece Goods: Yesterday, the market became more active. The upward trend of eastern goods was strong. Queqiao Hui bleached cloth rose 0.02 taels, selling at 10.075 taels. Zhigong satin consistently rose 0.0025 taels, with "First Merit" at 0.2925 taels, "Four Scholars" at 0.29 taels, Queqiao Hui at 0.27 taels, and Jiaoye Tishu at 0.2675 taels. Merchants from Hankou and inland areas were actively buying. Printed and floral Zhigong flannel in this street rebounded. Yuhuayuan Tu Hong opened at 0.3175 taels, Yang Guifei at 0.315 taels, Changcheng Qima assorted colors at 0.31 taels. Yuehua velvet is in short supply again and shows signs of further price increases. Fine wool serge is also rare, and continued observation indicates a potential surge in prices. Western goods remained dull, but market sentiment remained positive.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants Actively Purchase Yuanqing Broadcloth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Mud Velvet Guild market was quite good. Various thick and thin goods remained lively. Prices of mainstream goods were firmer than the previous week, and trading continued actively. Current inventories of plain Yuanqing broadcloth are low, and selling prices are gradually increasing. Most have been bought by Tianjin merchants. There is a risk of shortages of goods priced at 2.56 taels. Yesterday, Deji 123, Jiuda Facai, and Tianxiang 381 were all sold at 2.85 taels. Ningfeng Xileng Fangzhou sold two cases at a price of 2.65 taels. Huansha Tu was sold at 2.9 taels.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow Morning Citizens' Assembly</h3>
<p>Eliminate Communism and Suppress Rebellion, Celebrate Victory</p>
<p>Citizens of this city, because the Central Army has recovered Jinan and the suppression of rebellion is achieving successive victories, and the three rebellious figures of Yan, Feng, and Wang are about to be eliminated, there is a real need for celebration. At the same time, because the three rebels instigated the Communist Party to commit murder and arson in Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, resulting in an unprecedentedly tragic catastrophe,</p>
<h3>Suppress Rebellion and Eliminate Communism, Celebrate Victory</h3>
<p>At a time when the National Revolutionary Army unified the country and the central government was preparing to begin political tutelage, the rebellion of the Yan and Feng warlords suddenly occurred. This is truly a matter that makes our hearts ache. Since their rebellion, the people of the Northwest have been plunged into dire straits and immense suffering. Since their rebellion, the whole country has been in turmoil, and our work of political tutelage has been unable to proceed. They are the sinners of the Party and the nation. They are a group of demons in the revolutionary process. If we want to establish the Party and the nation on a bedrock of security and prevent the revolutionary cause from being abandoned halfway, we must first eliminate them, especially their ringleaders, the instigators of this rebellion: the three rebels, Yan Xishan, Feng Yuxiang, and Wang Jingwei. These three people are colluding with each other, and their doctrine is one of betraying the Party and harming the country. Although they say "courtesy, courtesy" with their mouths, they are only engaging in clever plundering and selling out the Party and the nation. Although they are shouting "all benefits belong to the people" all day long, in reality, exorbitant taxes and levies are as numerous as the hairs on an ox. The compatriots under their rule dare to be angry but dare not speak out. They are all eagerly hoping for the arrival of our Central Army. Recently, they have organized a so-called expanded conference with absurd statements and bizarre actions. Under the guise of revolution, they are actually selling out the country and the Party. The baseness of their character and the filthiness of their methods have reached an extreme. To summarize their crimes,</p>
<p>It is difficult to exhaust them all. Compatriots, "to catch bandits, first catch the king." They, the three of them, are the instigators of this rebellion, the ringleaders of the rebel army in the Northwest. If there were not these three madmen with no sense of shame, this rebellion would never have broken out. Therefore, we should, day and night, spare no effort to first suppress these three. In the past, there was a man in the Jin Dynasty named Zhou Chu who once eliminated three scourges. We should now rise up and eradicate the three scourges in the revolutionary process. In addition to suppressing the rebellion, our second step now is to eliminate communism. Everyone knows that communism is not suitable for China. Because China currently has no large bourgeoisie and is an industrially backward country, there is no possibility of implementing communism at all. However, there are now many blindly optimistic young people who have not recognized this point and are blindly shouting and running around with the Soviet government, which has no homeland. They take money from their masters and come to their own country to desperately stir up trouble, run magazines, and distribute leaflets, stopping at nothing in the hope of confusing the public, especially the young workers and peasants, so that they will rise up and engage in the work of destroying the Party and the nation and slaughtering the people. Recently, they have intensified their efforts and taken advantage of the Party's suppression of the rebels to carry out riots. The recent rebellion in Changsha and the exposure of the conspiracy of Xiong Guohua, the communist member of the Nanchang Social Affairs Bureau, are very obvious examples. If this continues, the danger is immense, and the future is chilling. Compatriots, rise up! Think of the future of the Party and the nation, think of your own happiness, you can no longer compromise with them. If your blood has not yet cooled, if you are willing to be a man of passion, you should rise up without hesitation to eliminate them, "banish them to the four barbarians, and do not share China with them." Demons will eventually be destroyed when they encounter sunlight. Icebergs will eventually melt in the spring. Armies with doctrine will eventually sing "songs of triumph" when they encounter a rabble. Now our upright banner, the just and righteous revolutionary army, is already preparing to enter the gate of triumph. According to recent reliable news, Tai'an has already been recovered, the enemy army in Jinan has been almost completely eliminated, and the communist party in Changsha has already fled far away upon hearing the news. At the same time, the Jinpu Line and the Longhai Line have also achieved great victories. The expanded conference that caused a sensation for a time has now reached a period of decline. Internal conflicts among the rebels are even more intense. The three rebels, Yan, Feng, and Wang, are all dreaming different dreams and clinging to their own opinions. Their collapse is not a problem. Their own graves have long been dug and are ready to be buried. In this sweltering summer, the brave soldiers at the front are desperately killing the enemy. Compatriots, we in the rear should unite and act as their support. Rise up, let us shout:</p>
<p>Down with Wang Jingwei, who betrays the Party and harms the country! Down with Yan Xishan, who indulges in cruelty towards the people! Down with Feng Yuxiang, who sells out the country and harms the people! Eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, which kills and sets fires! The Chinese Communist Party is the only enemy of the people! Eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, which deceives workers and peasants and slaughters the people! Console the meritorious suppression-of-rebellion soldiers who are toiling hard at the front! Celebrate the victory of the suppression-of-rebellion soldiers at the front! Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! Long live the success of the National Revolution! Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<h3>The Propaganda Department of the Special Municipal Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The spirit of the whole city is exceptionally indignant. Therefore, the preparation for the citizens' assembly is to show the determination to eliminate communism and celebrate the victory in suppressing the rebellion, which has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now all the matters of the conference have been prepared. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to all sectors. The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party yesterday notified all sectors, stating that since the rebellion of Yan and Feng and the central government's attack, successive victories have been achieved. Recently, Jinan was recovered, and most of the rebellious enemies collapsed. The period for resolution should not be far away. The committee has decided to hold a "Citizens' Assembly to Eliminate Communism and Celebrate Victory in Suppressing Rebellion" at the public sports field in the South City at 9 a.m. on August 29th. All organs, schools, and mass organizations in this city, as well as all party members and citizens in the city, should participate uniformly. In addition to sending letters separately, this notice is hereby given.</p>
<p>Participation Guidelines: (1) All workers, students, party members, and citizens in the city must participate in the citizens' assembly. (2) To participate in the citizens' assembly, you must obtain symbols, flags, and slogans from the Citizens' Training Association. (3) Those who have not obtained flags and slogans from the Citizens' Training Association must each prepare a flag. (4) The wording of the flags and slogans is stipulated as follows: 1. Support Commander-in-Chief Chiang, who has made great contributions. 2. Down with Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, and Feng Yuxiang, who collude with the Communist Party to harm the country and the people. 3. Eliminate the Chinese Communist Party, which kills and sets fires. 4. Celebrate the victory in the recovery of Jinan. 5. The victory in Jinan is the victory of the Three Principles of the People. 6. Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party. (5) Citizens participating in the assembly must gather at the public sports field before 9 a.m. Do not be late or leave early. (6) Citizens participating in the citizens' assembly must not privately bring propaganda materials and distribute them inside or outside the venue without the permission of the Citizens' Training Association. (7) Citizens participating in the citizens' assembly must absolutely obey the command of the commander-in-chief and the chief inspector and the inspectors.</p>
<h3>Yesterday</h3>
<p>Defense of the South City Intensified</p>
<p>Yesterday, the defense of the South City of this city was suddenly intensified from 2 p.m. yesterday. Municipal public security police wearing pistols were temporarily stationed at Ximen and along the Republic Road and Zhaozhou Road on the border between the Chinese and French concessions. It is said that the reason is that in view of the current unstable situation and rampant bandits, there is deep concern that villains will mix in and cause disturbances, especially in the areas adjacent to the Chinese and French concessions, which are prone to diplomatic disputes. Therefore, today, the defense of the North and South cities of this city should be slightly intensified at any time to consolidate local security.</p>
<h3>Resolution of the Sino-German Aviation Agreement</h3>
<p>German Letter of Approval Delivered the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>Awaiting National Government Approval to Convene Board of Directors</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Communications sent Section Chief Li Jingzong of the Navigation Administration Department to Shanghai to urge the German side, the German consultant, Lawyer Liu Shifang, immediately took the letter of approval to Qingdao to urge Schmidt, the representative of the Hansa Airlines, to issue it quickly. It is now known that the letter of approval was sent to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and it was immediately sent by fast mail to Beijing by Fugel, another German consultant. The reporter of the New Voice News Agency has learned the details and recorded them as follows:</p>
<h3>New Street Scenes</h3>
<p>Eye-catching Young Misses with Bobbed Hair and Cheongsam</p>
<p>In the Ximen area and various places on North Sichuan Road on Nanjing Road, young misses with bobbed hair and cheongsam come and go like shuttles. I have seen many misses' cheongsams, the clothing materials of which are unusually novel. The texture is either white, light lake green, or orange-yellow, all of which have unique prints. At first glance, they may be mistaken for foreign goods, but they are actually genuine old-brand domestic goods, that is, the artistic freedom cloth of the Sanyou Industrial Society. The clean and smooth texture, coupled with the wonderfully unique prints, is very beautiful. Modern new women in our country with ideas have mostly loved domestic goods. This kind of new progress clothing material will naturally be warmly welcomed by the female community.</p>
<h3>Admirable Dapper Young Men in Western Suits</h3>
<p>In the past, the clothing materials of the Western suits I saw were all foreign goods. Since the Sanyou Society's "212" soft freedom woolen fabric was produced, domestic Western suits have become popular, so what I see on the street is no longer the exception. I have always thought that patriotism and national salvation are empty talk, but I didn't know that once there is a suitable tool, everyone is willing to put it into practice. In the future, if we promote it more widely, imported Western suits will naturally decrease every day.</p>
<p>··························</p>
<p>Sanyou Industrial Society's storefront and mail order department on East Zhejiang Road on Nanjing Road in Shanghai, from August 20th in the Gregorian calendar, has a big sale for 21 days. In the cloth department and yukata department on the second floor, and the clothing department and quilt department on the third floor, ladies and gentlemen are like clouds, which is exceptionally lively. This kind of good phenomenon is naturally a comfort to the general public. Special 24 B 48</p>
<h3>The Process of Negotiation The Sino-German Aviation Agreement</h3>
<p>Was signed on February 21st of this year by Wang Boqun, Minister of Communications, and Schmidt, the representative of the German Airlines, in Beijing. On the 13th of this month, both parties convened another meeting. The attendees on our side were Wang Boqun, Wei Yifu, Li Jingzong, and Lin Tianlan. The German side was Schmidt, Fugel, and Liu Shifang. Both parties will review the entire agreement and make separate official records of the differing interpretations. Both parties agreed that the German side should first issue a letter of approval, and the Ministry will then organize the records and send them to Shanghai. As the records were sent to Shanghai, the letter of approval was delayed, so it was not delivered to the Ministry until the 26th.</p>
<h3>Fugel's Conversation The reporter of the New Sound Agency visited</h3>
<p>German consultant Lawyer Fugel yesterday. According to the conversation, after both parties held their last meeting on the 13th of this month in Beijing, the entire agreement has been decided. There is no so-called compromise solution. This morning I received a phone call from Mr. Li Jingzong from Beijing, stating that this matter has been completely resolved. Waiting for the approval of the National Government, we can convene a board meeting.</p>
<h3>Content of the Letter of Approval Dear Sir, based on this year's</h3>
<p>The contract signed on February 21st, according to Article 10, and based on the exchange of letters with the German Hansa Airlines and the minutes of the meeting on August 13th of this year, I approve the above-mentioned Sino-German Navigation Agreement. This is addressed to the Ministry of Communications, Schmidt, the representative of the German Hansa Airlines.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Hunan Rice Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>1,631 Bags</p>
<p>The first batch of Hunan rice arrived in Shanghai After the ban on Hunan rice was lifted on August 22nd, the first batch shipped was transported by Japanese ships from Changsha to Hankou and then transferred to Shanghai on the 23rd on the Japanese ships of the Yangtze River route. Yesterday, 1,631 bags were loaded, and the second and third batches of Hunan rice exported have been blocked due to the rice tax issue, and it is difficult to transport them for a while.</p>
<p>Hunan Merchants Continue to Urge Loading Due to the devastation after the robbery in Changsha, the commercial market urgently needs to be revitalized. Merchants from all over the world in Shanghai purchased a large number of goods to Hunan to meet the needs of citizens. Swire also sent the Xiangtan ship directly to Hunan, fully loaded with goods to go there. Just as they were preparing to export, they suddenly received a telegram from the Hunan merchants, instructing them to delay opening to avoid danger. Until yesterday, the Changsha gang sent another urgent telegram to Shanghai, urging the goods to be transported there as soon as possible. Yesterday, the Hakka announced to Swire that the Xiangtan ship would be allowed to carry the goods to Hunan tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3>Statement by Wang Xiaolai, Standing Committee Member of the Silk Industry</h3>
<p>The Issue of Japanese Cocoons Coming to China</p>
<p>Existing cocoons are insufficient for the raw silk materials needed in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</p>
<p>However, the suggestion to use Japanese cocoons is unlikely to materialize</p>
<p>The arrival of Japanese cocoons in China has a significant impact on our country's sericulture industry, which has attracted the attention of industrialists. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has also received a proposal from Gu Suming, a member of the Jiaxing Chamber of Commerce, advocating for measures to prevent it. The chamber will submit it to the Standing Committee for discussion. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically visited Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Standing Committee Member of the Silk Industry Association, to inquire about the truth of the matter. According to Mr. Wang's statement, China is a country based on agriculture, and the benefits of sericulture are also well-known. However, this year, both rice harvests and cocoon production have been poor. It is a pity that our country has always paid little attention to statistics, so it has not been able to provide accurate figures on the total national cocoon production and the amount of cocoons required by silk factories. Therefore, there is no way to adjust and prevent it in advance, and there is concern of digging a well only when thirsty when the time comes. In fact, cocoon production statistics are not very difficult. Even based on the cocoon tax collected by the government, a rough estimate can be obtained. Silk factories can be instructed to have the General Association of Silk Factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces report. In this way, if Chinese cocoons are sufficient for domestic factory use and there is a surplus, they can still be exported abroad. If they are only sufficient or even lacking, exports can be prohibited, or the cause of the shortage can be investigated and remedies sought. This spring, Japanese silk merchants also came to China to purchase cocoons for shipment to Japan, about 2,000 piculs. As for the current stock of cocoons, statistics from the number of reeling machines in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, including remaining cocoons, are still insufficient to supply the raw materials for silk reeling for one year. Taking Shanghai as an example, there are currently 108 silk factories, with a total of over 100,000 workers. If production stops due to a lack of cocoons, the livelihoods of the workers will inevitably be affected. Therefore, manufacturers have proposed purchasing Japanese cocoons. However, this proposal has not yet materialized. There are three reasons: (1) The value of Japanese cocoons is 200 Japanese yen per picul. The current Japanese exchange rate is high, equivalent to about 300 silver taels. Adding in the loss from silk reeling, the best cocoons yield 300 catties, and the next best yield 400 catties. Based on this calculation, the cocoon price is already 1,200 taels. Adding the reeling labor cost of 100-200 taels makes the cost too high, and silk factories may even worry about losses. (2) Japanese cocoons must be steamed with a cocoon boiling machine to be suitable for use, but very few Chinese silk factories have this equipment, only about one-tenth of the total number of silk factories. Therefore, different machinery cannot be used together. (3) Silk threads with a count of 13-15 or below are considered fine silk, and those with a count of 13-15 or above are considered coarse silk. Japanese cocoons can only be reeled to a count of 16-18, which cannot reach 13-15, let alone below 13-15. Due to the above three reasons, the proposal to purchase Japanese cocoons was eventually shelved. Except for a few dozen catties of sample cocoons shipped to Shanghai, there were no large-scale imports. Previous reports that a certain Japanese ship transported several packages were found to be untrue. However, the fact that Chinese people pay attention to this is a good phenomenon in the industrial sector. If our country can actively promote agricultural products and increase production, not only will Japanese cocoons not be able to enter, but American wheat, Indian cotton, and Saigon rice can also be expected to disappear, etc.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Service Between Suzhou and Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Telephone Service to Begin on September 1st</p>
<p>According to the Continental News Agency, after the telephone bureaus of Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces discussed and finalized the telephone service contract for long-distance calls between Suzhou and Hangzhou, they are now preparing everything related to the telephone charges. Both parties will each receive one-third of the line transfer fee, and the remaining revenue will go to the local bureau. The first places to have telephone service are Suzhou, Lili, Shengze, Zhenze, and five other locations. The official launch of the telephone service is scheduled for September 1st. The price list for telephone charges will be printed and announced within a few days, etc.</p>
<h3>Jinliyuan Case</h3>
<p>The Future Does Not Look Optimistic</p>
<p>The French Arbitrator Has a Very Firm Attitude</p>
<p>Their Demands Exceed the Scope of Arbitration</p>
<p>As a result of the negotiations in recent days regarding the China Merchants Bureau Jinliyuan Wharf case, although the French Consul-General Gankerlin has expressed a very good attitude, the arbitrator from the San De Tang (a French organization), Yaminer, has a very firm attitude and wants to insist on implementing the contract termination, which is completely against the original intention of arbitration. Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency obtained accurate information from a certain source and recorded it as follows:</p>
<h3>Yaminer's Opinion: San De Tang Decided to Arbitrate</h3>
<p>After becoming the arbitrator, our arbitrator Gao Shuo, a lawyer, immediately visited Yaminer. According to Yaminer's statement, he still cannot deviate from legal solutions and requested that Gao Shuo draft a written opinion to be sent to the French Public Office. Gao Shuo agreed to consider it and immediately requested that Yaminer first submit his written opinion for review. It is now heard that it was sent to Gao Shuo's residence on the evening of the 25th. According to his opinion, there are three points: (1) Deposit 12,000 taels of rent received by San De Tang from the China Merchants Bureau for the spring and summer seasons. (2) Limit the China Merchants Bureau to return the wharf and real estate buildings by the end of August of this year. (3) Subsidize the China Merchants Bureau with 6,000 taels for the old materials used in the warehouse. He completely regards himself as an arbitrator who implements the contract termination method.</p>
<h3>Gao Shuo Visits Gan: After Receiving Yami</h3>
<p>ner's written opinion, Gao Shuo, a lawyer, believed that it completely violated the will of the French Consul-General and decided to visit Consul-General Gan again this morning for active negotiations in preparation for arbitration.</p>
<h3>Original Contract Stipulation: In 1916, Article 11 of the contract renewal between the China Merchants Bureau and</h3>
<p>San De Tang stated: "If there is any dispute between the two parties regarding the interpretation and performance of this contract, it shall be submitted to two arbitrators, one selected by each party. If there is any dispute between the arbitrators, the two arbitrators shall select a third arbitrator who has the full power to adjudicate and bind both parties, and no further request shall be made to the court for reconsideration. The arbitration fee shall be borne by the losing party."</p>
<h3>After Chen Xizeng Resigned</h3>
<p>The National Government is Still Sincerely Retaining Him</p>
<p>Otherwise, Give Chen an Appropriate Position</p>
<p>Chen Xizeng, the newly appointed Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau, resigned more firmly after returning to Shanghai from Beijing due to the unresolved funding issues of the China Merchants Bureau. Furthermore, because the Ministry had already appointed Song Shuqiao to succeed him as the Director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, Chen instructed various departments to rush to handle the affairs on behalf of him for days. Yesterday morning, he suddenly went to the Telegraph Bureau to complete everything, and in the afternoon, he did not go to the bureau to work. It is heard that the date of the new Director-General taking office has not yet been decided. The National Government is also sincerely trying to retain Chen from resigning from the China Merchants Bureau. If it is impossible to retain him, they will have to ask Wang to look for a replacement again and give Chen an appropriate position.</p>
<h3>Cai Pei Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Requesting Instructions on Bureau Affairs</p>
<p>Cai Pei, the Acting Director-General of the China Merchants Bureau, traveled to Beijing on the 11:00 PM express train last night to request instructions from Minister Wang Boqun because the newly appointed Chen Xizeng had not yet taken office and bureau affairs were difficult to proceed. He also urged the new Director-General to come to the bureau to oversee matters. It is also heard that Cai appointed Mao Changsi, the former Superintendent of the Yichang Customs and Negotiator in Jiujiang, to work in the Secretariat yesterday to assist lawyer Gao Shuo in handling the Jinliyuan Wharf case.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Went to Beijing Last Night</h3>
<p>Discussing Various Issues of the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing went to Beijing by train at 11:00 PM last night to negotiate everything at the invitation of the National Government authorities regarding the China Merchants Bureau issue. Acting Director-General Cai Pei also went with him. A solution may be found for personnel and financial matters, etc.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Xiangren (Hunanese) Rescue Hunan Association</h3>
<p>Please Send Elite Troops to Vigorously Suppress the Communist Party</p>
<p>Resolution Made at Yesterday's Emergency Meeting</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Xiangren (Hunanese) community, deeply concerned about the ongoing atrocities of the Communist Party in Hunan Province and the sight of beacon fires in the south, held an emergency meeting at the Asia Hotel yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The following important resolutions were made: (1) Elect Shen Chenyi, Li Zhanggu, and others to represent the association and immediately request the authorities to send elite troops to vigorously suppress the Communist Party in order to save the 30 million people of Hunan Province. (2) Continue to send telegrams to Xiangren (Hunanese) in various provinces to jointly participate in the Hunan rescue movement. (3) Publish "Ten Days of Communist Party Disaster in Hunan" and request materials from all parties (send to the Hunan Guildhall for transfer) to compile a booklet and distribute it nationwide to promote anti-Communist propaganda. (4) Send a letter to the Shanghai Hunan Guildhall to withdraw funds for use. (5) Raise funds from all parties. (6) Accurately determine the short-term and long-term proposals for the party and government issues in Hunan Province and submit them to the petition representatives. (7) Advocate for the speedy reorganization of the party and government organs in Hunan Province and punish the Chairman of Hunan Province, He Jian, the Provincial Party Committee, and the Provincial Government Committee to appease public anger. (8) Contact the Xiangren (Hunanese) in Beijing to act in unison.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Authorities</h3>
<p>Spare No Effort in Promoting National Products</p>
<p>The Third National Products Movement Will Be Held in Early October</p>
<p>In Addition to Exhibitions and Lectures, There Will Also Be a Fashion Show</p>
<p>Affected by the high price of gold and the low price of silver, the industrial and commercial sectors of this city have been declining day by day. Various sectors have gathered to discuss relief measures, and all believe that promoting national products is the only method, and they believe that promoting them at this time is an appropriate opportunity. The municipal government is also aware of this and specifically formulated implementation measures for promoting the use of national products in the middle of last month, ordering all subordinates to comply. It was reported in the previous newspaper that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau is planning to hold the third National Products Movement Conference in this city in early October based on these measures. It has been approved by the municipal government to allocate preparatory funds. It has been found that this movement has been held in the city in the 17th and 18th years and has achieved very good results. It is heard that this session will also expand publicity, and in addition to exhibitions, lectures, and recreational activities, a national product fashion show will be held to increase visual appeal.</p>
<p>It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Encourages the Purchase of Chen Jiageng's Rubber Products</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated yesterday that Mr. Chen Jiageng of Jimei has been running Xiamen University and Jimei School for more than ten years, using more than 8 million yuan. Every year, the surplus profits from his rubber business are used to run education, which is an unprecedented move in the industrial sector. Foreigners therefore feel jealous and squeeze him in various ways, resulting in Mr. Chen's business being affected in recent years. This move is not only related to the safety of the overseas Chinese industrial sector, but also the key to the success or failure of our country's private universities. It should be vigorously supported. Rescuing one point of crisis for the industry is cultivating one point of lifeblood for education, and it will also allow the enthusiastic educators in the country to gain inspiration and avoid feeling isolated and helpless and losing heart and becoming discouraged. In particular, a circular has been sent to various trade associations stating that whenever there is a purchase of rubber products, Chen Jiageng Company should be purchased first so that the company's business will not be unable to stand due to foreign squeezing. Merchants who are enthusiastically patriotic are requested to pay attention, etc.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association</h3>
<p>Telegraphs to Request Exemption from New Silk Tax</p>
<p>The Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance of the National Government yesterday, requesting exemption from silk and satin donations and taxes after the abolition of Likin. The original text reads, "Our association recently received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance on July 29th, presenting the Minister of Finance with deep affection and remote encouragement. Our association members are deeply grateful and have notified all silk industry groups in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to respectfully comply, work hard to improve, increase the sales of Chinese silk, expand production, and live up to the virtue of the kindness and benefit the people. However, our industry members have suffered from the proliferation of donations and taxes for a long time. We are rejected by other countries with heavy taxes and plagued by heavy and harsh taxes in various places. Like sheep butting a fence, we are in a dilemma and can hardly move forward or backward. Every time we pass through a place, we have to pay another tax, so we cannot sell far away, and those who are not on the verge of extinction are few. Fortunately, you have a clear understanding of the crux of the problem and resolutely plan to implement the reduction and exemption of silk and satin donations and taxes when abolishing Likin to save the industry from danger. We are grateful for your great virtue and benevolence. Now, the temporary plenary meeting of the industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces has resolved and telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that when Likin is abolished, no new donations and taxes of any kind in the name of offsetting should be allowed to occur, so as to obtain fundamental relief, etc. It is reasonable to follow the resolution and present a special telegram. I hope that you will graciously approve and resolutely preside over it, which is no different from bringing the dead back to life, and it is also the honor of our industry alone. We directly present it, and we ask for instructions to follow. The national economy and people's livelihood depend on it for survival, which is a great convenience. Jiangsu and Zhejiang Silk Weaving Association bows and kisses the seal."</p>
<h3>Wheat Flour Shipped North</h3>
<p>The Ban Will Be Lifted on September 1st</p>
<p>The National Government previously issued an order to the Jianghai Customs to prohibit the shipment of wheat flour to Tianjin Port because the southern harvest was poor and the war broke out. According to reliable sources, after the implementation of the ban, merchants selling wheat flour in the north turned to purchasing foreign flour. Recently, more than one million bags have been traded, and foreign merchants are reaping the benefits while Chinese merchants are greatly hit. Therefore, representatives were repeatedly sent to Beijing to petition, and wheat flour merchants subscribed for one million yuan in public bonds. It is heard that the ban will be lifted on September 1st, etc.</p>
<h3>The Suzhou Chamber of Commerce Representatives Conference Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Discussing Provincial Business Tax Issues</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Government yesterday, stating: "In order to comply with the matter, according to the report from the Department of Finance, the case of the business tax preparation has been submitted to and approved by the 302nd meeting of the Committee of your government. The members have been appointed on record. The Business Tax Preparation Committee was established on August 13th of this year, and the first meeting was held on August 14th to discuss various issues in progress.

<h3>Yao Cong Discusses Japanese Police Administration</h3>
<p>According to the National News Agency, Yao Cong, the former director of the Capital Police Department, was appointed by the National Government as a special commissioner for inspecting Japanese police administration this spring. He returned to the country from Japan a few days ago and will go to the front line soon to visit Chairman Chiang and present everything in person. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the National News Agency specifically visited Yao at his residence in Yipinxian to inquire in detail about the current situation of Japanese police. According to Yao, Japanese police administration has four major characteristics: (1) Organization. The Japanese police organization is consistent throughout the country, unlike the police in the United Kingdom and the United States, some of which belong to local organizations and some to the central government, with different treatments and different degrees of work. Therefore, Japan is quite proud of its unified police administration. With unified police administration, it can achieve unified command under the orders of the Ministry of Interior. (2) Power. Japanese police were once subordinate to the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Military Affairs, but police administration did not improve. Since the Meiji Restoration, police administration has become independent and has made progress day by day. Recently, even soldiers who commit crimes can be arrested, but they must be handed over to the military police for punishment, and the military police must also punish them according to law. Therefore, soldiers not only dare not bully the police, but also have considerable respect for them. There is no hindrance to the exercise of police power over the people. (3) Education. Most of the current Japanese police have graduated from middle school, followed by graduates from specialized schools and elementary school students, and there are also university graduates. With excellent qualities, they are also given police education, so they can be responsible for maintaining safety. (4) Treatment. Japanese police are all officials. Even those who are on the streets responsible for guarding and directing traffic are treated as appointees, not as soldiers like in our country. After 15 years of service, they can apply for retirement, and the annual retirement allowance is one-third of their original salary. Because of the good treatment, it can attract outstanding people and enable them to devote themselves to their work and not abuse their political lives. (5) Funding. Taking the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department as an example, the annual budget is more than 18 million. The national inspectors are subsidized by the national government, totaling more than 80 million, and several times more is paid by local taxes. With more funding, it is easy to do things. Looking back at the Capital Police Department in our country, it only had more than 1 million per year when it first started, which is really incomparable. Furthermore, Yao has detailed records of this inspection and has written "Record of Japanese Police Administration Inspection," which has been completed and will be published next month.</p>

<h3>The Red Cross Amending Bylaws Committee</h3>
<p>Third Meeting</p>
<p>The Red Cross Amending Bylaws Committee held its third meeting at 2:00 PM on the 25th. The members present were Li Zhenbang, Ye Zhisheng, Hong Yanbao, Xu Xichun, Xue Shaoting, Wen Lanting, Dong Xinqin, Wang Peiyuan, Jiang Daqiu, Yang Ke, Liu Hongsheng, and Wu Jia.

<h3>New Developments in Coastal Shipping</h3>
<p>Wenzhou Adds New Ships: The Shanghai-Wenzhou route is listed as an inland航线 (hángxiàn, shipping route). When the three companies signed the shipping contract, foreign merchants were prohibited from operating steamships. This year, the shipping industry in the port has gradually improved due to the transportation of a large amount of tax grain. There are currently two steamships and four motorboats operating on Shanghai. The Zhejiang Construction Department has agreed to open the Wenzhou commercial port and dredge the Ou River to develop Zhejiang's sea transport wheel (sea vessel) industry. An on-site survey and plan are already underway. In order to expand the Zhejiang sea route shipping industry, the Sanbei Company in this port has specially ordered a 1,000-ton sea vessel at its factory, named Sanbei, which is preparing to open the Shanghai-Wenzhou route. The hull is now ready and can be completed within three months. This wheel (vessel) can start operating in the early winter of this year.</p>
<p>Foreign Cloth Transport to Ningbo Greatly Reduced: Ningbo's increase in the import tax on foreign cloth caused opposition from the Pitou (bulk cloth) industry in Shanghai. Initially, it was proposed to increase the Pitou (bulk cloth) tax by 400,000 yuan per year. Then, the tax bureau changed the method to collect 7 jiao (a unit of money) for each piece of foreign cloth. After the announcement of this matter, the Pitou (bulk cloth) industry in Shanghai adopted a passive boycott, stopping the shipment of a large number of Pitou (bulk cloth). Those that had to be transported were changed to added boxes and taken away as passengers and goods so that they would not be considered pieces and could be exempt from taxes. As a result, the export goods of the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo route suddenly decreased. This matter has not yet been resolved.</p>
<p>Mediating the Chongming-Hai'an Tide Dispute: The six wheel (sea vessel) companies in the Chongming-Hai'an route, such as Shanghai Ping'an and Daxing, suffered significant losses as a result of competing for business and indiscriminately dropping passenger fares. Last time, the Shanghai Shipping Association invited the six companies to mediate, advocating unity and cooperation. After the agreement was reached, disputes arose over the allocation of annual operating quotas, leading to a breakdown. The companies then submitted a request to the ministry for assistance. The ministry has already replied and sent a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Association, instructing it to send committee members again to mediate with the six companies on behalf of the ministry to resolve the dispute as soon as possible and avoid mutual destruction. The companies have been notified to send representatives to the meeting to discuss the method of reconciliation so as to avoid mutual injury.</p>
<h3>Yuanda Ship Released by Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Yutong Acknowledges and Pays 57,000 Yuan in Towing and Repair Costs</p>
<p>Yutong Company's Yuanda ship was chartered by the Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet last time. Because it ran aground in the middle, it was towed out by a Russian ship. Afterwards, it demanded 92,000 yuan in towing and rescue costs and repair costs and detained the Yuanda ship. Chen Xietang, the owner of Yutong, negotiated with the Soviet Russian fleet repeatedly, but there was no outcome. Later, after the British merchant, Maler, the owner of the Shangci 洋行 (foreign firm), mediated, the towing and rescue costs and repair costs were purchased from 92,000 yuan to 57,000 yuan. This matter was finally resolved. The payment was remitted by Yutong from the 朝鲜银行 (Chosun Bank). The Soviet Russian Commercial Team has already received it and will release the Yuanda ship. Because the Shangci 洋行 (foreign firm) has a large amount of Russian timber loaded in Vladivostok, it ordered the Yuanda ship to transport the Russian timber to Shanghai. The case of the Soviet Russian detention of Chinese ships has come to an end.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit Regarding Eviction from Yongkang Lane</h3>
<p>Tenant Accuses Landlord</p>
<p>The landlord of Yongkang Lane on North Sichuan Road, last month, entrusted a lawyer to send letters to all tenants, stating that the property had been sold by Yongkang Company to Wanfu Company, and that the house was planned to be demolished and rebuilt.  Therefore, all tenants were required to move out by August 15th. After receiving the letters, the tenants were greatly alarmed.  It was discovered that the company (Yongkang Company) originally had seven or eight shareholders who jointly established it. In June of this year, two or three of the shareholders invested in a merger and renamed it Wanfu Company. They were falsely using the name of demolition and reconstruction to drive away tenants, and then renovate the premises to freely increase rent. The house was built on land leased from the Yao family in the second year of the Republic of China (1913), with a term of twenty years. Counting to the present, there are only three years and several months remaining. There is no reason for demolition and reconstruction. Therefore, all tenants (a total of fifty-six households, large and small, with more than seven hundred people) besides moving out, actually have forty-eight households. They publicly elected representatives Zheng Guogan, Ouyang Hengran, etc., and also hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a petition with the District Court, requesting an injunction to prevent unwarranted eviction, in order to maintain people's livelihoods. The case had a hearing once, and was not concluded. The day before yesterday morning, presiding judge Zhao Zhenhai held another hearing. Many people attended the hearing, as many as sixty or seventy people, mostly tenants from the lane. The visitors' seats were full. On the defendant's side, lawyer Tao Jiachun was retained to make a statement in court. After the judge took his seat, he asked the plaintiff's lawyer what he was requesting. Lawyer Chen stood up and said, "I request the court to order the defendant to prevent the plaintiff from moving, and to not increase the rent." The defendant's lawyer stood up and argued, "It is found that each tenant owes rent for ten months or eight months. Under such circumstances, moving is unavoidable." The plaintiff's lawyer stood up again and said, "Most of the tenants are brokers, and moving is very difficult for them. I request the court to help them." The judge then instructed the two lawyers to reconcile outside the court. If reconciliation fails, another hearing will be held and a judgment will be made according to the law.</p>
<h3>Rice Boat Damaged by Reckless Boat</h3>
<p>Two Crew Members Missing</p>
<p>Heavy Losses</p>
<p>The rice selling boat Taifusheng, recently collected 180 shi of white rice from Ye Jin area in Songjiang, and transported it to Shanghai for sale. The day before yesterday morning, while sailing on the Huangpu River in front of Dujia Hang, it was suddenly struck by a reckless foreign steamship traveling at high speed. Tao saw it and was steering to avoid it, but the right side was violently struck by the steamship. There was a hole more than a foot in size. Three of Tao's crew members were knocked into the water at the time. The steamship, seeing the accident, continued to speed away. Fortunately, a customs patrol boat saw it and stopped it and brought it back to help rescue. One of Tao's crew members was rescued by the customs patrol boat. Two other crew members are missing. Tao's boat was flooded and was about to sink. The steamship arranged for it to be towed to the beach. However, the rice in the cabin was all wet. He negotiated with the steamship to compensate for the loss of the boat and cargo. At first, the steamship did not admit responsibility, but later agreed to compensate 300 yuan for the damage and repair of the boat. Tao refused, because the rice was all wet, and the loss was considerable. He continued to pursue the steamship. The ship has been detained and negotiations are underway. It is unknown how it will end.</p>

<p>Wu Zhicheng, a native of Jiangdu, is thirty-two years old and has been doing business in Shanghai for many years. He previously opened the Hongkou Lianji Transportation Company in Hongkou. Two days ago, he moved to a new house at No. 46, Garden Lane, Lane 129, Jin Shenfu Road in the French Concession. Wu himself is the second landlord. There is only his wife, Shi, in the house. Wu is fond of gambling. Horse racing in various parts of Shanghai always draws him to it. Recently, with the rise of dog racing, Wu has become an even bigger dog enthusiast. The night before last was the date of the Yiyuan dog race. Jin Shenfu Road was nearby. He went there happily. It wasn't until 12:15 yesterday morning that he finished the race and returned. Unexpectedly, as soon as he arrived at the entrance of the alley, two people in white shirts and trousers standing by the side of the road saw Wu coming and greeted him. Wu stopped. One person approached and whispered to Wu, "Please help me today." Before Wu could answer, the person took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired at Wu. Fortunately, he did not hit him. The bullet hit the wooden door of the Qiankun Tai grocery store at No. 127 at the entrance of the alley and made a hole in a kerosene tin can. Fortunately, the can was empty, so no disaster occurred. Seeing that one shot missed, the assailant aimed at Wu's lower body and fired three shots in a row. All three shots hit the upper part of his left leg. Wu screamed for help. When neighbors arrived, the assailant had already fled without a trace. People reported it to the police. The police chief, upon hearing the news, immediately ordered the detective to investigate and sent Wu by car to the nearby Guangci Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, none of the three bullets hit vital points. His life could be saved. But a part of his tibia has been injured.</p>
<h3>Unexplained Death of a Woman</h3>
<p>Xu Baoju, Alone and Without Family</p>
<p>Unknown Poison Used for Suicide</p>
<p>Xu Baoju, a twenty-three-year-old woman from Hangzhou, lived alone in No. 24 Pingwang Street. No one knew her background. On the evening of the 25th, the woman suddenly went to the Zhejiang Hotel at No. 250 Hankou Road to stay in a private room. At 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, someone called the woman. The waiter Chen A'dong went to her room to call her to answer the phone. Unexpectedly, the woman had already secretly taken poison and committed suicide. He immediately reported it to the Laoza Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. The cause of death was not clear. The body was taken to the Feilun Road morgue. First, a doctor from the Public Works Department examined it. The result was that it was difficult to determine what poison she had taken. It was speculated that she might have swallowed opium. Yesterday morning, Guo, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, was commissioned to inspect the site. Although the police summoned the neighbor, Mrs. Yang Qu, they were unable to find out what kind of person the woman was or the cause of her death. Since no family members were found, Guo ordered the Pushan Villa to provide a coffin and burial. He also ordered the police to investigate the cause of death and report it for verification.</p>
<h3>Electric Fan Kills</h3>
<p>Wu Dingfang... Electrocuted to Death</p>
<p>Zhou Jaran... Should He Be Held Responsible?</p>
<p>Wu Dingfang, a local, was an apprentice at the Dasheng Printing House at No. 150 Zhoujiazui Road. At 2:00 PM on the 21st of this month, Wu walked barefoot through the printing shop and knocked over an electric fan. The fan was already damaged, which led to electrocution and death. After the Huishan Police Station investigated the cause of death, the manager of the printing house, Zhou Jaran from Taicang, was deemed to bear considerable responsibility as the owner of the shop. If the damaged electric fan had been repaired earlier, it would not have led to a fatal accident. Zhou was detained and sent to the Special District Court, which ordered him to be released on bail of 2,000 yuan pending trial. The trial opened yesterday morning. The police lawyer stated the facts, saying that Wu's death was caused by Zhou. As the saying goes, "Although I did not kill Boren, Boren died because of me." He should be punished. When Judge Feng asked Zhou, Zhou confessed. The verdict was not announced.</p>

<h3>Rampant Bandits Outside Wusong Port</h3>
<p>Counties Bordering the Sea Suffer Another Disaster</p>
<p>More Than Twenty People Kidnapped for Ransom</p>
<p>Outside Wusong Port, in the Da'an Port area bordering Tongzhou and Haimen, there are more than a thousand sea bandits gathered, with over a hundred bandit ships of various sizes. After Zhang Han, the fourth district chief of the Wusong water police, dispatched Captain Lin of the eighteenth squadron to lead patrol ships to jointly suppress the bandits with the Haimen County police, the bandits scattered to the outer sea. Unexpectedly, more than three hundred bandits sneaked ashore at Xinchang Town and looted everything. The day before yesterday, at around 5:00 AM, they sneaked to Lingdian Port and first went to the Public Security Bureau, seizing more than ten guns and injuring three policemen. Then, they surrounded the entire town and carried out large-scale looting, resulting in losses of about 40,000 yuan. They kidnapped more than twenty men and women for ransom, including Feng Jiming, Hong Jinkang, and Xu Dasheng. They then went to Yuehe Port and Xingang, looting them one after another, and fled to the area of Lusi Port.

<h3>Hope for Reconciliation in Rent Increase at Yile Lane</h3>
<p>Yile Lane on Tangshan Road in Hongkou, this city, previously experienced opposition due to the landlord increasing rent, as reported in this newspaper. Subsequently, representatives of the lane's tenant association, Wang Huitang and Ye Yunping, mediated the matter. The landlord, the owner of Dingkang Qianzhuang (money shop), no longer held as intense a position as before. At the same time, they also stated that they would absolutely not take the rent increase as an issue, but due to the water company having raised prices and the increase in land taxes by the Public Works Department, they had no choice but to do so. Now, with your mediation, I will also consider the livelihoods of the residents." Later, the tenants in the lane convened a meeting and decided to voluntarily increase the rent by two yuan per building, and four yuan per storefront, to be implemented from January 1, 1931. It is heard that the landlord's side has expressed willingness to accept.</p>
<h3>Two Fists Kill a Man</h3>
<p>Over Three Yuan for Clothes</p>
<p>Chen Han, a woman from Chongming, is twenty-six years old. Her husband has passed away for many years. She inherited the carpentry business at No. 2, Lane 87, South Street, Hai Chao Temple, outside Xiaonanmen. The business is quite prosperous. She has a younger brother named Han Amao, who is twenty-three years old and very strong. He used to be a street paver. He has no family, so he lives with his sister. Last year, through an acquaintance's introduction, she employed an apprentice named Shi Caiyuan at the store. Unexpectedly, the apprentice suddenly ran away last month. She asked people to search for him everywhere, but he could not be found. Recently, she learned that the apprentice had been recommended by Ni Wenlang, a Chongming native, to Bian Erlang, a native of Haimen, who works as a sawyer at Chuanxinhe Bridge inside Ximen. Mrs. Chen and her brother Han Amao went to Bian to negotiate, wanting to bring Shi back. Bian agreed, but said that the apprentice had been here for a month, and the cost of food and lodging would not be discussed, but the three yuan he borrowed to make clothes should be returned. Mrs. Chen also agreed. Bian then asked Ni Wenlang to accompany them to get the money. When they arrived at Mrs. Chen's house, she suddenly changed her face and questioned Ni, "Why did you abduct my apprentice and sell him to someone else? Now you are trying to extort money." Ni also argued with her. Seeing that there were many carpenters, he was afraid of being at a disadvantage, so he endured it and retreated. He reported back to Bian. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, Bian and Ni went to Mrs. Chen's workshop to demand the three yuan for the clothes. Mrs. Chen refused to comply. At first, there was a verbal argument, and then a conflict broke out. Kong Xiande, a guard at the 26th post, heard about it and rushed to the scene. He saw Mrs. Chen's brother, Han Amao, violently punch Ni in the waist twice. Ni immediately fell to the ground in extreme pain, unconscious, and urinating and defecating. Police Kong arrested Han and took everyone involved back to the third precinct of the first district. At the same time, he quickly sent the injured man to Nanyang Hospital for treatment. The hospital found that Ni's injuries were severe and could not be treated, so they refused to admit him. He was then returned to Mrs. Chen's carpentry shop by car. He died on the way. Jin, the police chief, ordered Han and others to be interrogated. As the case involved human life, he ordered them to be sent to the Shanghai District Court for questioning. He then ordered the local chief to report to the court for an examination. At around 4:00 PM, Prosecutor Zhao, accompanied by forensic officials, arrived at the scene and examined the body. The deceased, Ni Wenlang, was covered in purple bruises. He died of fatal injuries sustained during the attack. He ordered the relatives of the deceased to sign a statement and collect the body for coffining. It is reported that the deceased, Ni Wenlang, was only twenty-seven years old and worked as a sawyer.</p>

<p>Tang Liusheng (16 years old) who lives in Beishenjiazhai, Longhua Town, West Shanghai, Xiao Henan (17 years old) who lives in Caohe Temple, and Lu Huxiang (21 years old) who lives in Shanxiali, Xiaomu Bridge, are all child laborers in the loading room of the Longhua Arsenal. It has been four years. Recently, the three children do not know what kind of magic they have been affected by, and they are obsessed with immortals. They often want to cultivate. They are usually devout in eating plain vegetarian food to repay their parents' kindness, and they must recite sutras and incantations every morning and evening. However, they are still working hard, so their families did not take it seriously. Unexpectedly, the night before yesterday, Tang, Xiao, and Lu did not return home. Yesterday morning, the Longhua Arsenal Labor Union suddenly received a registered letter in the name of Tang and other three children, with the factory symbol attached, requesting it to be returned on their behalf, and stating that they had all gone to cultivate immortality, and earnestly requesting someone to tell their families not to be sad. Upon inspecting the envelope, it was sent from the Minhang Post Office. After the labor union informed Tang Liusheng's old mother, Zhang, and the heads of the Xiao and Lu families, they learned the truth, cried loudly, and immediately took the Shanghai-Minhang bus to find them, but there was no trace. According to the locals, yesterday afternoon, three people wearing Su blue cloth short shirts and trousers, resembling child laborers, were seen passing through the streets, but it is unknown where they went. Therefore, the three families of Tang and others returned crying in pain. However, Tang Liusheng's mother, Zhang, suffered a great shock to her nerves after losing her son. She did not eat or drink every day, and searched everywhere, in an extremely pitiful state. It is hoped that kind people everywhere, if they see the three children, will please notify the Xinchun Garden in front of Longhua Great Temple. If the flesh and blood are reunited, it will be a great good thing.</p>
<h3>Li Jingxian, Executive of the China Leprosy Association, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association previously sent executive Li Jingxian to various ports in Nanyang to promote leprosy relief and raise funds. After receiving the order, Li went to Penang, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and other places, working hard and sparing no effort. He won enthusiastic support from the local overseas Chinese, and the results were quite impressive. Recently, he contacted gentry and business tycoons in Selangor to organize a fundraising committee, raising funds of up to ten thousand yuan. In today's environment of high gold exchange rates and economic depression, to achieve such results shows Li's spirit of doing things and the local people's enthusiasm for leprosy relief. However, due to the heavy burden of work, he became ill from overwork, so he plans to return home temporarily for recuperation. It is heard that Li has recently arrived in Shanghai. Before leaving, he was treated to farewell banquets by Ye Longxing, chairman of the local fundraising association, as well as gentry and business leaders Chen Derong, Zuo Runsheng, Tan Tingkang, An Liangmei, Huang Heting, Qiu Rushan, Lin Jie, and Chen Dechi, who also presented generous gifts to wish him well.</p>

<h3>Literature of Poland</h3>
<p>Before the European War, Poland, like India and Egypt, suffered the fate of national subjugation. Despite several revolutions under the yoke of Russia, Germany, and Austria, it could not escape the fate of being a forcefully controlled and suppressed nation. However, after the war in Europe, it gained independence. In its journey to fight for freedom and independence, we cannot ignore the revolutionary poets and writers who fueled the Polish revolution. They stirred up the oppressed Polish nation in their songs, fought and struggled in the wars that overthrew the rule of Russia, Germany, and Austria, and shone with extraordinary brilliance in the dark era of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The mid-nineteenth century was the golden age of Polish literature. The first poet who could be called the Polish Dante was Adam Mickiewicz. His creations, like the tragedy of his country, were subjected to unexpected changes. He was imprisoned and exiled in Russia and foreign lands. Therefore, his works also changed due to the stimulation of the environment. In prison, he abandoned rosy dreams and gave up the praise of fleeting love, transforming his early melancholic tone into a lament for the collective misfortune of his nation. Later, in the war against Russian rule, he sang of the bravery of soldiers and the glory of death, although his own destiny was accompanied by the same misfortune as the defeated. But his greatness was admired by all Polish people. Moreover, he wrote the national epic "Mr. Thaddeus" about the failure of the Polish people's hope that Napoleon would defeat Russia. It implicitly contains the cloud that unfortunately enveloped his country, everyone's hope for victory in war, and the hope for the revival of the Polish nation that filled the hearts of the Polish people, all vividly presented. Therefore, in order to realize his doctrine of the resurrection of the motherland, he did not hesitate to organize the Polish army to help other countries attack their main enemies, Russia and Austria. Although he died before facing the enemy, he was always a leader of thought for all Polish people, forever occupying the position of a prophet, and guiding beyond literature. He was the first writer in Poland to gain practical experience in reality.</p>
<p>In contrast to Mickiewicz's career was the poet Juliusz Słowacki. In the success of art and literature, although he used poetry as a tool to imply national thought and religious philosophy, he paid attention to human emotions in the vast material. Therefore, in the unfinished long epic "Beniowski," he discussed international and national religious, philosophical, literary, and social issues. In the poems "At Sunset on the Sea" and "Agamemnon's Grave," he deeply expressed sorrow for the fate of the country divided by violence and coercion, and the wandering of the people, giving people a strong emotional stimulus in sorrow. Therefore, in terms of realism, he was better able to write about the encounters of the entire Polish nation. Therefore, examining his entire works, "The King Spirit" narrates the spirit of the motherland presented during the rule of various countries, "Kordian" writes about the panorama of Poland during the 1830 revolution, and "Anhelli" is a complete depiction of the Polish nation under the partition of the Russian, German, and Austrian empires, describing the suffering of Polish prisoners exiled in the cold Siberian prison. He was as famous as Mickiewicz in the same era. In the Polish literature of the nineteenth and even the twentieth centuries, the few poets who could best express revolutionary enthusiasm apart from romanticism and realism were either decadent or pessimistic. Therefore, of the three great romanticists, in addition to the two of them, there was also Zygmunt Krasiński. Although he was a serious poet who did not deeply think about philosophical human events, in "Psalm of Faith" he recalled Poland's painful past and its future mission, and "Psalm of Hope," which predicted future success, described the human love necessary in revolution and terror, and "Psalm of Love" are all immortal works. However, the harvest in realism was not as great as that given by the romantic poets. The female poet Mary Konopnicka was a singer of the pain of workers, peasants, and the oppressed, with democracy as her backbone. Bolesław Prus was a humanitarian novelist with democratic ideas who sympathized with the common people. However, Henryk Sienkiewicz was the one who gained world reputation from Poland's standpoint.</p>
<p>Henryk Sienkiewicz was the greatest writer in Poland in recent times. The latter half of the nineteenth century was entirely his world for twenty-five years. He was famous for writing historical novels. Apart from some works with a pessimistic tone, his works expressing Poland were also very great. The novel "The Lighthouse Keeper" describes a Polish exile who was a lighthouse keeper in the West Indies. He was dismissed for neglecting his duties because he read Mickiewicz's poems and fell into longing for his homeland, reflecting the sorrow of the subjugated. "Mr. Wołodyjowski" writes about the bravery of resisting the Turks on the front line. "Fire and Sword" writes about the story of the Polish people defending against the Cossack invasion. "The Diary of a Schoolmaster" writes about the oppression given to them by the Russian Empire. "Bartek the Conqueror" contains a strong Polish national spirit.</p>
<p>The above group of writers were all figures active in the environment of experiential philosophical thought. They once set up landmarks and pillars in popular culture, established a new era in literature, indicated that the Polish nation had surpassed the spirit of class, accommodated the common people into the splendid "Pantheon," and used the aristocratic epic skills to describe all the suffering and misfortune of the harmed. After the failure of experiential philosophy, the entire literary world gradually became occupied by the high-minded and impressionists who sang "art for art's sake," and there were no great productions until recent years. All that existed were merely works of art.</p>
<p>After the death of the old writer Henryk Sienkiewicz, in the past ten years, Władysław Reymont shouted out the voice of resistance from the oppressed, Stefan Żeromski put forward the literature of individual resistance as a social appendage, and Stanisław Przybyszewski and the humanitarian Jan Kasprowicz died one after another. This group of poets, influenced by the humanitarianism of the deceased Jan Kasprowicz, gathered in Warsaw to publish the "Skamander" journal to promote everything of international poets. However, in Warsaw, there was also a group of young poets who used national legends as their themes to promote the national spirit. They had a deep feeling for their hometown, and everything was based on local myths, ballads, and customs. Under the leadership of their journal "Czartak," they advocated using simple, primitive language and artistic methods to express the national spirit. They took the poet Emil Zegadłowicz as their representative, forming a reflection with the new Polish international poet Julian Tuwim. In these two major trends, due to Poland's international status, the nationalist young poets were more welcomed by the people. (Yi Kang)</p>
<p>Literary Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Hawthorne, Tired of Socializing</h3>
<p>Hawthorne was the most solitary of modern American writers. However, while he hated socializing with others, he was particularly close to Emerson.</p>
<p>Emerson fully understood Hawthorne's temperament. Apart from socializing with Emerson, Hawthorne hated interacting with all other writers. He thought it was more interesting to play funny games with captains, workers, and sailors than to interact with writers.</p>
<p>Although he and Emerson met frequently, they didn't say much apart from what was necessary. And Emerson was also very silent. Therefore, even when they met, the words they spoke could be counted.</p>
<p>When Markley and Hitnis Smith met, the two people just sat opposite each other without saying a word. The two mouths were sealed as if one hour, two hours, or even three hours passed. Perhaps everyone knows this story.</p>
<p>But Hawthorne and Emerson were even more formidable than this pair after all. (Ping)</p>

<h3>Lakeside Song, A Great Narrative Poem</h3>
<p>By Mu Hong, published by Nanhua Bookstore</p>
<p>Night comes, catching the ashen night,</p>
<p>I am marching in an already stirring dream. Under my feet are two paths—</p>
<p>One called the red war, one called the red love.</p>
<p>Some list me among Satan's group,</p>
<p>Others call me the star of salvation,</p>
<p>But all I have is more than just these monotonous titles,</p>
<p>Because my heart is something I myself don't understand.</p>
<p>It's just that the old era gave me depression and pain, and future dreams gave me longing and pursuit.</p>
<p>I am a struggling child in life. I can't help my heart beating…</p>
<p>Although the torch of yesterday has gone out, the east is not yet bright,</p>
<p>Although the great dream of this morning has just broken, the rooster's crow has not yet been heard.</p>
<p>What to say about war, and what about love?</p>
<p>I am here, having lived through ordinary storms…</p>
<p>I have gone crazy once or twice in war,</p>
<p>I have also gone crazy once or twice in love.</p>
<p>It is precisely the wings of love and war</p>
<p>That have grown horizontally from under my ribs.</p>
<p>What cannot be forgotten is the infatuation of the beauty,</p>
<p>What cannot be avoided is the majestic shadow of the lake and mountains.</p>
<p>The beauty, the lake and mountains, the lake and mountains, the beauty,</p>
<p>………………………………</p>
<p>The above is the first section of the prelude to Lakeside Song</p>
<p>Mentioning this great narrative poem, I can't help but think of the time I spent with the poet Mu Hong. That was in the winter of the seventeenth year, when we lived in the pavilion room of a certain alley on North Sichuan Road for two or three months. Mu Hong, like all true poets, was silent, gentle, beautiful, and also had keen observation, good reason, and the most ardent passion. His burly, northern-type body almost touched the low ceiling when he stood up. He often sat silently in front of the bed. The room was too small. We couldn't put another orange between the bed and the table, so he had to lean over the table or lie down. Smiles never left his face, just like the morning sun that never left the horizon, making a smile in the golden clouds. His good reason was often observing his inner life, and he related to people with a child-like purity. Just spending a period of life with him, I felt that my temperament had changed a lot. He didn't often read books, and rarely picked up a pen to write anything. Often for several months, except for writing letters—which was also rare—he didn't write. But the books he read in a week exceeded what we read in a month. Every one of his works was completed in the shortest period of time. "Red Sun" took nine days, "Lakeside Song" took three days. Thinking about completing such a great work in three days is almost a miracle.</p>
<p>Once, a friend told us the following story, which was said to be a true story that happened in Dongting Lake a few years ago. He borrowed that story to write this work, asking me to write a novel with the same story, saying that our works could be published together in the future. But after reading his poem, I could no longer write a single word, until now. Last year, I released this poem at the Nanhua Bookstore, and even the promised preface was not written, because this poem was too huge a giant in front of me, and I couldn't add anything to it.</p>
<p>This is a truly Chinese thing, a Chinese story, singing about the passionate love of Chinese people, using the Chinese style. He completed Chinese poetry, raised the banner of romance, and declared to the world with this poem, "Look, there are some truly great things here that are ours. From here, you can understand the soul of China. Here, our past is contained, and our future is also displayed." It sings about war and love, the peak of human activity, just like everything that romance sings about. However, what is different from the old romance and the new Marxist romance is that there is not such a strong color of heroism and individualism. Our hero, carrying war and love on both sides, is indeed a hero, but he is also such an ordinary person. He is just like our brother, like the people we often approach. He lives in a legendary situation, but his life is so close to us. This is a declaration belonging to mankind, a march towards the perfect future of mankind, igniting the flames of hot blood in the banner of our nation, pure light and full enthusiasm.</p>
<p>This long poem of more than three thousand lines is written in a beautiful tone, like a melodious song, and like the most fluent prose. It has an attractive force that makes you have to talk to the last line after opening the book, and after reading it, it will always occupy your mind. The most beautiful, and at the same time the most powerful. If a foreigner asks me about Chinese poets and poems, I will not hesitate to mention "Lakeside Song" and its author first (secondly, I will mention Ke Zhongping's "Sea Night Song" and "Molin—Malin").</p>
<p>This is a great poem, like all great poems—there is no doctrine, no dogma, no politics, and no socialism, whether correct or false. It is impossible to find anything in it that can be written as a declaration or slogan, so it is impossible to criticize it with these. It is written with the soul of mankind—but according to behaviorism, not only is there no soul, but there is no heart. Then I should say it is written with the entire spirit of mankind, with the bright behavior of mankind, all the same. In here, how strongly the spirit of our nation, the largest part of mankind (excluding the number of yellow people gathered under China, that is to say, they all have some important common characteristics, and the number of people who can be represented by the term China is the largest), is displayed here.</p>
<p>The story of the narrative poem is roughly as follows. A vagrant sings of his life experience. Because of the pressure of opportunity, he went to the lake and occupied the area, becoming the leader of the bandits. With his bright heart and ardent emotions, he swept through the heart of the lake and the shore like a breeze blowing in Jingjiang. Accidentally, because of the sound of the pipa, he unconsciously aroused the heart of a married woman. Immediately, strong love occurred between them. He risked danger and did everything to be his lover. Therefore, on the one hand, it was entangled love, and on the other hand, it was constant war. But the hero on the lake finally could not resist the long-term pressure of the official government. Because of an internal agent, the career disintegrated. She disguised herself and went to prison to see her—and then said goodbye forever, embarking on his wandering journey.</p>
<p>The poem is too beautiful, I can't quote it, I'm afraid I've written too much. Now I'll just record the last paragraph to end my humble article.</p>
<p>I am now in—</p>
<p>In this bleak night,</p>
<p>Still forgetting the pain,</p>
<p>Because—</p>
<p>That love, in front of me,</p>
<p>—Longing…</p>
<p>You, you,</p>
<p>Your face,</p>
<p>Lotus,</p>
<p>Your smile,</p>
<p>Red as the sun,</p>
<p>Your eyebrows,</p>
<p>Green as the mountains,</p>
<p>Your entire waist,</p>
<p>Rainbow on the sea,</p>
<p>No beautiful description…</p>
<p>Your hands,</p>
<p>White jade carved like a painting,</p>
<p>Warm and like a heart,</p>
<p>Also like the sound in the lake…</p>
<p>The trembling shadow in the heart of the water…</p>
<p>Night light, frog sound, water sound, grass movement…</p>
<p>All your symbols</p>
<p>You are the spirit of beauty,</p>
<p>—Night,</p>
<p>—Night,</p>
<p>—Deeply,</p>
<p>—Heavily,</p>
<p>Secretly—</p>
<p>Intentionally, unintentionally,</p>
<p>We met,</p>
<p>Met,</p>
<p>With love,</p>
<p>Reborn,</p>
<p>Born again from tomorrow,</p>
<p>The spirit of mankind,</p>
<p>Born again from tomorrow,</p>
<p>Our new heart—</p>
<p>New love,</p>
<p>There's more below, but I won't quote it anymore, because such beautiful chapters can't be copied completely, and the night is very late.</p>
<p>Our poet is now in his hometown, in the embrace of nature, in poverty. I haven't written to him for a long time. This little bit of my humble work is not worth offering to him. It's just enough to express my admiration and remembrance. August of the nineteenth year, Pei Liang.</p>
<h3>European Writers' New Works in Review: Angioletta (11)</h3>
<p>— Man Ru</p>
<p>A Play by the Spanish Azorín</p>
<p>In the past, people in China who wrote novels and plays had an old saying called, "If the book is not enough, the Bodhisattva will come to make it up." The meaning is that when the plot reaches a point where the author can't get out of it, only asking the Bodhisattva and gods to come and turn things around can it be done. Therefore, in old novels and old dramas, we often see the protagonist encountering difficulties, and suddenly a savior comes from the sky. This method, of course, exposes the weakness of the technique, but it is very convenient for the author. Therefore, that old saying not only expresses the superficiality of old novels and old dramas, but it is still applicable today. In the West, this situation has not disappeared, but that was still in the Middle Ages. It was completely eradicated in the eighteenth century. Moreover, the "Miracle Play" of the Middle Ages mostly used the Bodhisattva as an important character, which is also a bit different from the use of the Bodhisattva as a floating bridge in our old literature.</p>
<p>The disappearance of gods and miracles from the Western stage and the pens of playwrights has been two or three hundred years. But recently, miracles seem to have started yawning on the European stage, preparing to be resurrected. Because the Spanish playwright Azorín not only gave the first yawn to miracles in his recent play, but also clearly declared that miracles must be resurrected on the European stage.</p>
<p>The fact is this: Azorín, a prolific and exquisite Spanish writer, recently wrote a play, "Angelita." In this play, he applied "miracles," and applied them very well. As for this short play, it is both energetic and charming, and can undoubtedly be regarded as one of his masterpieces. However, it is difficult to say whether the success of this play is due to the use of miracles or has nothing to do with miracles, because these two are mixed together and cannot be separated. However, the author's claim is that miracles and wonders, which were expelled from the stage in the eighteenth century, should return to the stage, because "after the tangible and obvious reality, there exists another more subtle, more real, more permanent reality."</p>
<p>The protagonist, Angioletta, is concerned about her own future destiny and eager to predict it. She gets a jade ring. Wearing this ring, rotating it once can move her forward one year. She is very impatient and spins the ring twice, so her age increases by two years. She finds herself married, but because things happen too quickly, she gets confused and mistakenly recognizes her father-in-law as her husband, and her husband as an outsider. Later, she rotates the ring five times, and suddenly finds that her house has been transformed into a hospital for heart patients. Finally, she meets three Angiolettas, two of whom (one is a female New York journalist, and one is the wife of a certain scientist) disappear, and the third transforms into the existing Angioletta. But Angioletta at this time is a woman who has lost a lot but has become much smarter.</p>
<p>In this era where the scientific world is changing a lot and scientists have many new studies on time and space, we don't need to criticize a writer for playing this trick with time. Moreover, Azorín's work has a light and gentle style, the characters are clearly personalized, and the dialogue is fast and natural throughout the play.</p>
