<h3>各國議會休會後</h3>
<p>世界各國議會。近正紛紛休會。日本議會雖甫召集。然開幕後亦即休會。兩派之大競爭亦祇在努力準備。至政戰開始。須俟休會期滿以後。此世界之政治消息。所以日見沈寂也。况乎經濟堕落之情勢。愈趨危急。世界人之視線。皆注集於此一點。各國當局亦正竭全力以謀所以善後救濟維持之道而不暇顧及於政治方面之措施。此所以政聞之益形沈寂也。然此政聞之沈寂。並非停頓不進。而實在暗中醖釀耳。各國經濟界之險象愈甚。則其影響於政治各方面必愈大。在身處政黨之人。久久見政府無法轉變此危急之情勢。則非特向與政府反對者。將憤怒政府之無能。即與政府無甚好惡者。亦將漸疑政府措置之未善。結果必思另創一局面以處理之。此爲世人普通之心理。故以情勢論。經濟上之棘手愈甚。政治方面之問題。必愈增多。然而政聞反見沈寂者。則以此種從來未有之趨勢。旣甚重大。欲另創一新局面。亦非易事。當然有若干時期之醖釀。而不敢輕於妄動故今日政聞之沈寂。半爲議會休會。半亦爲醖釀未熱也。倘一旦休會期滿而政府仍無法以轉變此情勢者。則以前之所醖釀。必將暴發。而政界隨以多事矣。然則欲破此政聞上之沈寂。其在明年各國議會開始後乎。</p>

<p>敎育消息特載</p>
<h3>江蘇省立實小聯合會兒童生活指導組研究報告（一）</h3>
<p>南京女子中學實騐小學報告胡叔異</p>
<p>一、小小的引子</p>
<p>奉了上届大會的使命、將兒童生活指導研究的獲得、作一個整個的報告、</p>
<p>時間有限、這個大人的兒童生活指導問題、祗能作一個小小的簡單底報告、</p>
<p>吾們謹以十萬分的熱忱、將兒童生活指導研究的獲得獻給諸位導師們的研究和參考、</p>
<p>自然這報告裏没有多大的發見、可以貢獻、也没有精深的學理、可供深究祗有些研究的獲得事實的經過不論是和非、對與錯、老老實實地寫在下面、供諸位導師們的深究和檢討、同時、吾們十二分誠意期待着喜歡研究兒童生活指導的敎師們底幾個嚴格的批評、</p>
<p>二、兒童自治底史的觀察</p>
<p>兒童没有被發現時代的敎育、簡直可以說一句話、兒童受敎育、奸比坐監獄、自維持王族貴族僧侣、上流社會特權之敎育、至保存國家繁榮的斯巴達敎育、而至於砲含宗敎色彩的個人主義之敎育都係蔑視兒童敎育的實例這是歷史的陳跡無可諱言的、</p>
<p>敎育界的園地裡有了一個狂醉於自然之美活動於人類情的生活中的　校（ＪＥＡＵＪＡＣＵＥＳＲＯＵＳＳＥＡＵ）兒童才被發現到了本世紀初有了北歐瑞典的愛倫凱（ＥＬＬＥＮＫＴＹ）兒童本位的敎育、才得發現盧氏著有愛彌爾一書崇尙自然、力斥以前敎育的謬誤、吾們親愛的兒童、才得被辦敎育者注意爱氏著有兒童之世紀一書深概家庭敎育的衰徴大吹學校敎育的革新敎育思潮裡才有兒童爲本位的微波、</p>
<p>可是事實告訴吾们自十八世紀的末葉到二十世紀的初期吾們的園地裡雖然發現了兒童敎育的思潮内也有了兒童本位的微波可是一般的兒童、依然是以前一樣的兒童學校裡除了些微的改革外、其餘的其餘一切仍舊和從前一樣或許可以說差不多吧</p>
<p>值此高唱兒童世紀的呼聲中、近十年來、咱們中國的敎育界、大都辦理兒童自治、來適應這兒童世紀聊臨的呼聲、兒童本位的敎育思潮、</p>
<p>這裡我們對於現行一般的兒童自治、要下一個普通的檢討、和嚴格的批評、</p>
<p>在死氣沉沉的中國敎育界裡不需要一味恭味的批評眞的、吾們要把兒童自治的原則上、組織上和實施上的病患、赤裸裸的暴露出來、或許可以做一般走入岐途者的當頭棒喝、</p>
<p>老實說病態的暴露、也是研究的工具、</p>
<p>一原則上的病態</p>
<p>Ａ、訓敎分家劃出敎育的一部份、辦理兒童自治學校裡請了個訓育在任專司管理兒童品性的陶養再請幾個先生、專敎兒童一些書本知識的獲得這樣訓自訓敎自敎各走各的路的、</p>
<p>活動是兒童知識獲得的工具、嘗試是經騐完成的手段請問這訓敎分割的活動、能夠滿足兒童生活麽、</p>
<p>要聞</p>

<h3>高級盃賽樂華昨被淘汰</h3>

<p>周李陳三將苦鬥</p>
<p>昨耶　佳節、下午三時樂華長球隊戰　華斯　進園足球場、作高級盃第二週賽結果樂華鍛羽而歸英軍霍華斯以八比二大勝、而淘汰之、　　支敗局勉力三脚撑昨日之樂華不勝今昔之感矣、苦雨凄風中、勉爲支持耳、曹桂成又未能出席、其不棄權而出場者、已不易易、何可負哉、昨日全局、幾全操英軍之手任意所之、全軍之得以不敗、成落花流水者則周賈言李寗陳　温三人勉力支持耳、其陣綫如下、</p>
<p>周賢言李寗關洵安王樹林胡繼武梁桂生楊人偉奚巧生周紹文陳虞添李琳</p>
<p>强淩弱如入無人境</p>
<p>以赫赫之霍華斯、戰强弩之末之樂華、操刀可不費力、全綫五鋒、不脫不高、進退合一、與樂華相差天壤、街均不弱、惟守門者則稍差、交鋒九十分鐘、霍華斯來往自如、横掃南北、似入無人之境、其陣綫如左、</p>
<p>馬爾斯開根彼琴　斯脫勞賓孫馬丁</p>
<p>密勒魏特馬离姆飛但氏强生</p>
<p>陳虞添平地一聲雷</p>
<p>樂華開球爲敵所得、自中而右、周賢言逸以待勞、繼而反攻、亦以越位不能進、樂華一鼓作氣、聲勢尙佳、六七分鐘之際、陳虞添飛步捷足、向右邊快馬侵入離門約十碼地舉足遠攻、守門麻爾斯、不及跳起敵門竟破、全場歡呼、以此形勢度之、似不信樂華之有若是之慘敗也、</p>
<p>十二碼接連爲敵算</p>
<p>方以爲樂華今日、或有轉機之一線希望戰及二十五分鐘敵中鋒离姆飛匹馬叩關禦之不及而成平手、自後英軍聲勢倐焉入盛、左右縱横、任意所之、球自開根而左翼密勒、三至中鋒亨姆飛、周賢言徒手無助、樂華乃以一比二敗、一敗再敗李寗正在阻敵、裁判員以其犯規、判罰十二碼、右衛彼琴趕來踢入、元氣一傷、樂華遂不可救藥、英軍右翼强生從右飛來、遠遠離門三十碼地斜起一球落網角而入、樂華上半時以一比四敗</p>
<p>周言賢竟成衆矢的</p>

<h3>昨日紀念雲南起義大會</h3>
<p>各界代表到者甚衆</p>
<p>市黨部上海特别市黨部執行委員會、昨日上午九時、召集各界代表、在該黨部三樓舉行雲南起義十五週年紀念大會、到會團體一百餘、出席代表共計七百餘人、各鄉區亦分别舉行紀念式、各情分誌於後、</p>
<p>大會職員主席楊清源紀錄周寒梅司儀許也夫、招待張漢雲·陳銘·姜眞吾·袁清平、</p>
<p>到會代代表中華法學會毛雲·上海法學院畢業同學會何元明·上海市修造民船業工會陸大富余明章·郵政總局韓宗一楊思禮·華商電氣工會湯俊生·市社會局楊政·商務工會徐孟鄰·等一百餘團體、代表計七百餘人、</p>
<p>主席報告各位代表、各位同志、今天是雲南起義第十五週年紀念日、就是因爲袁世凱稱帝自爲、取消民國、本黨同志在民國四年十二月二十五日雲南起義的日子、袁逆在過去的軍閥之中、是野心最大的一個在滿清時、他的軍權也最大、他在清室稱臣時、早有取而代之之勢、及辛亥革命起、乘機纂民國、旣違背總理的主張、在北平就職、繼之摧殘革命勢力、壓迫革命同志、妄自稱帝、袁逆之稱帝、一方固然因爲他酊人的野心、同時楊度等一般小人之拍馬勸進、也不爲無因、那時民主政治、雖已澎湃於全世界、但中國人民智識幼稚、對於政治、毫無認識、所以袁逆爲皇稱帝、斯時的民衆、大多渾渾噩噩、同時帝國主義者、乘歐戰方酣、想覇佔中國、於是袁逆在這個機畿緣中、居然完成了他皇帝之夢、當時總理知道袁逆不能盡忠民國、所以在野時、聯絡革命同志、暗中團結一致、計劃倒袁的工作、故袁氏稱帝綫十三日、雲南即於十二月二十三日致最後之通牒於袁氏、要求恢復民國、并將楊度等槍斃、袁逆當然不下令接受這種主張、雲南就宣告稱立、正式討袁、袁逆初爲左右所蒙蔽、至此知道已鑄大錯、遂憂憤以死、所以總合雲南起義的事實、可說是封建勢力與民主勢力的爭鬭、爭鬭的結果、民主勢力終於勝利、現在民國已告統一、本黨勢力、又已及於全國、閻馮等封建軍閥、也告肅清、但各地封建勢力、仍舊異常囂張、官吏的貪汚、土劣的横行、時有所聞、要曉得封建勢力、是建築在土地資本之上、土地問題、不加以澈底解决、封建勢力、斷難肅清、此次四中全會、决議先肅清匪共、這當然是很重要的工作、因爲匪共肅清以後、人民就可以安居樂業、但按照事實上、即使匪共肅清、有許多百姓、仍無居可安、無業可樂、因爲根本上有許多農民、無田可種、所以今後應希望中央、能注意及此、對土地問題、有一個澈底的解决、將總理（耕者有其田）的遺敎實現、那麽占中國百分之八十以上的農民的生計問題、得以解决、而中國革命、也可以完成、不致走上一條歧路上去、因爲封建勢力、是建築在土地資本之上、那麽土地問題、加以解决後、因經濟平等、就可完成政治上的平等、四中全會、對於發展實業、曾加以充分的注意、但是發展實業的目的、要達到、應該注意到人民的購買力上、假定人民的講買力强、發展實業、自無多大問題、倘使人民生計窘迫、無論怎樣提倡國貨、發展實業、結果、還是紙上談兵、所以土地問題的解决與否、不僅是封建勢力是否肅清的關鍵、也是發展實業問題的鎖鑰、第二點、就是打倒帝國主業、這個問題、到現在差不多是老生常談、但是實際上、中國革命、離開打倒帝國主義的距離、還是很渺茫、同時帝國主義一日存在、中國的革命事業、也一日不能完成、在國際帝國主義之中、侵略中國最急最利害的、要算日本帝國主義者、他本國的生産品、有百分之四十五、是運銷到中國來的、所以日帝國主義者、最不希望中國革命成功、有和平統一的强固的中央政府、所以我們應認清楚、日本是中國革命的最大敵人、要完成中國革命、要</p>
<p>使中國的國際地位平等、經濟地位平等、政治地位平等、非先打倒日帝國主義不可、打倒日帝國主義的第一步方法、便是抵制日貨、倘使國人完全採用國貨、抵制洋貨、他的效力、就可制日帝國主義者的死命、其他歐美各國、他們侵奪中國市場的野心、因他們本國經濟恐慌、而加緊他們的進攻、所以我們要打倒國際帝國主義者、便該抵制　國外貨、堅决的持久的採用經濟絶交的手段、今天雲南起義紀念、我們回想到民國締造之非易、民國敵人之衆多、值茲全國重告統一、不禁懲前毖後、提此二點、以勉到會諸代表、望大家切實做去完了、</p>
<p>演詞紀要首由陳克成演說、略謂、今日雲南起義紀念日聆主席報告、不禁有所感想、以告到會諸代表、肅清封建勢力、確爲今日我國革命之嚴重問題、市政府創辦之地方自治訓練所之目的、其意義即在將來之市政、不爲貪汚土劣所纂竊、而由一般革命同志努力、但肅清封建勢力、决非單從地方自治所克完成、其他種種努力、仍有賴於本黨同志、及一般革命民衆之奮鬭云、繼由楊思禮·金錫涵·梁文法等、相繼演講、詞長從略、</p>
<p>縣屬各機關上海縣屬各機關聯合紀念雲南起義會、於昨日上午九時、在縣政府大禮堂舉行、各機關人員全體出席、由縣整委會宣傳部長姜彦秋主席、領導行禮後、報告雲南起義經過事實及其意義、繼由縣長嚴愼予等、相繼演說、末呼口號散會、</p>

<p>添置衛隊海氛不靖、浙東海面、常有海盜爲害商輪之事、現在滬甬線内四公司輪、尙未設　衛兵、今次會議時、已經提出討論、經四公司一致意、故在新約内規定、（乙）各公司在滬甬航線、得各自配着武裝衛隊、其經費可酌量略加客脚抵補之、一此事已由四公司在協議增設中矣、</p>

<h3>招商局失竊烟葉案</h3>
<p>竊去烟葉均搜獲</p>
<p>南棧棧員被看管</p>
<p>李總辦大事整頓</p>
<p>積弊有澄清之望</p>
<p>烟葉失竊棧房竊貨、到處皆然、此中積弊、最難破獲與廓清、李仲公總辦自接管招商局後、便刷新棧房、以對客立大信、對司員則除積弊、會今次許昌有巨額烟葉運滬、卸存南棧第七號棧中、共有六千餘件、此烟價值至昻、存棧以後、發見每件烟葉中折除若干磅、李總辦得信、即令視察處密查、居然在本棧中搜出此被竊之貨、</p>
<p>搜出原贓南棧視察處、協助烟商鼎記職員等到七號棧内搜查、果在棧存之雜糧中、檢出烟葉三十餘件、代價約值二千金、蓋竊貨者一時不及運出、不得已不將其混進雜糧中、意欲待機連售出外者也、</p>
<p>清卸貨件李總辦對此事辦理十分認眞、蓋惟其如此、可以得客都之信仰、可以清歷久之積習也、已命各烟商將六千餘件烟葉、全數赶卸出清、俾可知失竊之數目、又令棧務處將他貨盤查、查明有無其他之被竊者、故七號棧連日卸貨甚忙、不日可澈底明瞭、</p>
<p>棧員看管竊烟之賊、尙未查出、贓證雖在、而猶無肯認行竊之人、但棧員翁幼山職有專屬、不能諉卸、不知自否監守自盜、猶難斷定、昨日李總辦已命令南棧視察處將翁看管、以待清棧後再究、此事發生後、各客對李之認眞清弊、顧重商貨、咸表信仰之同情、</p>
<h3>淞口外餘東港兩少女被綁</h3>
<p>崔常麟家飛來横禍</p>
<p>先遭搶刦次綁二女</p>
<p>吳淞口外沿海之餘東港口、前晚十一時許、突有匪船二艘盜匪二十餘人、携槍登岸、擁至居户崔常麟家中搶刦、臨去時、將崔之長女巧林（十九歲）次女巧貞（十三歲）綁架而去、中途巧貞欲圖脫、被匪放槍擊傷、倒於路旁、匪等遂將巧林架上匪船、揚帆逸去、聲言一星期内必須備欵取贖云、</p>
<h3>浦東高橋火警灼死二人</h3>
<p>夫婦意成同命鴛鴦</p>
<p>消防不良延燒兩家</p>
<p>浦東高橋三官堂地方東七十五號門牌農夫陳秋亭、年五十四歲、妻陳凌氏、年四十六歲、前晚臨睡時、在灶間内燒水洗脚、睡後火未全熄、致火種落在柴薪上、頓時火光熊熊、即成燎原、而陳夫婦日間勞動操作、夜間熟睡如死、故房屋全燒、人猶未醒、待火灼身、烟霧迷漫已無出路、夫婦同葬火窟、爲同命之火鴛鴦、而是處救火器具不良、故火又延燒七十四號范王生家、七十六號陳小紅家、經竭力施救然大部已焚去、未曾蔓延他隣、其陳秋亭夫婦之屍體、直至昨日始行扒出、由一十七圖地保高林全投地方法院報騐、而屍弟陳小亭、則投院請求免騐、</p>
<h3>一碗飯送命</h3>
<p>老母慨乎言之</p>
<p>其子意以身殉</p>
<p>高昌廟龍華路六十七號門牌平房内阜寗人周紀雲、係爲拉黃包車生活、其子周步　、今年廿二歲克紹箕裘、繼父之業、但家中人口衆多、每日耗費飯食頗巨、生活　度高昻異常困難、前日晚膳、周步慶食量殊宏、多吃一碗飯、其母楊氏向之謂、尙有人没有吃飯哪、少吃些罷、周步慶聞此言後、感受重大之剌激、默然不聲、歸房即寢、昨最日高三丈、猶未見起床、乃由其父推門視之則已立懸床上自縊身死、撫之體已僵冷、全家號哭、由崗警報告二區警署、令飭十四圖地保計安國投地方法院報　尸屬要求免、未奉核准、即由楊檢察官蒞騐後、諭令收殮、</p>
<h3>濬浦局洋員出缺聘用華人充任</h3>
<p>濬浦局自前年金前交涉員與海前總工程師及梅稅務司等議决嗣後濬浦局洋員出缺、不再續聘、悉用華工程司充任、於是該局張華浜工場總監工英人哈特、在黃浦江挖泥船上發薪時、被盜槍擊斃命、其遺缺當時宋局長主張用華人充任、曾登報招請、旋因投考之華人、均係資格未及、故暫時雇用法籍俄人却勃林、（即現被暗殺者）其所遺之缺、現暫由該局派建築課朱華副工程師暫代、近聞繼任該局工場監工之人、尙未擇定、而局長宋子良、仍主張按照議案應聘用華工程師充任、始符原案、惟須俟會議後决定、</p>

<h3>大掃除之籌備王梅璩</h3>
<p>國歷十二月二十五日。已奉局布告。舉行大掃除　聞各處居民均不敢不遵行。而在此大掃除籌備期間頗有足資談助者。請錄之以實本談。舊雨中有居蘇杭毘連之地者。昨來滬上。樽酒談心。言及國歷之勵行。謂子丑寅三代遞建。事本不奇。因述其鄉間李周二姓近事。李姓家小康。一女傭陳氏受雇已五年餘。人極謹愿。其家距離不遠。亦從無人來探視。主人倍之。一切什物。均交之管領。近聞主人云將遵令作更新之大掃除。意滋不悅。曰此細事何必拘拘。且蟄居鄉僻。誰實見之。主人笑其固執而已。乃陳忽稱病。求去。並以包裏相篋一一呈騐。明日眛爽即行。旣行鄰人告主人曰。陳嫗隨身。何得有如許件。而主人細檢之下。衣飾杯箸頗有所失蓋陳家雖無人來。而彼間一兩月必回家三四日以爲帝。此次掃除令下非其回家之常期。故迫而求遁。此一事也同時鄰村周姓事尤趣。周某室有二婦。大婦黃。小婦沈。皆小家女。以先後入門分大小。其實皆非結髪。黃姓稍直。而欠和平。其遇沈也。時而談笑。時而齟齬。皆無成見。而沈則從無所忤。黃喜亦喜。黃怒不怒。人多稱之。貌亦秀於黃。周粗識文字能閱報又慨然思呈身社會。有一小位置。平時於國府政策。亦頗留心。昨語二婦。謂祈歷新年宜盡情娛樂。又使於十二月二十五日。遵令作大掃除之舉。黃性急。即將室内零星什物先事整理周坐於旁視之沈忽翻然而入。笑曰。額汗涔涔矣。何急迫至此。因助黃收拾。黃拒之。沈不聽且曰。一室三人。我固不作　篋賊因推黃使稍坐。方推　間。黃袖中堕一物於地周拾而視之色變。問</p>
<h3>南洋游記（一一二）</h3>
<p>緬女對於華人。亦甚願嫁之。蓋欲享安逸。避自已勞働之苦也。而對於華人敎育界尤甚歡迎。華人常有在當地娶一緬婦。利用其言語及商業智識合作以致富者。往往有之。此亦致富最便利之塗也。華人與緬人種族混合之分子已甚多。又多鄉村華人雜居爲商工者。遍於全境。幾無地不有。蓋關係之深如此。不可不知也。</p>
<p>遊南洋各埠。有一普通之困難。語言名稱之雜亂固矣。而西人所釘於街墻上之街名。字標太小。又有時糢糊不清。以致尋訪甚難。夫尋訪街名。乃市政最大最要之事。人人必須。豈可字小糢糊。記吾南京市民。曾有一模範之舉動。足冠於世界。即每大街有特立之丈餘横額表坊。作斗大字。表其爲某街也。此點極可模範。天下事不比較。則人我短長不知也。南洋各埠。溝流汚水。並不加蓋。甚害衛生。</p>
<p>緬甸有金緬甸之號GOLDBURUINA一任各人民來分其肥。英人攬其全權。印人則富者爲大商。智者爲官吏。次於英人之官吏。常用印人。下者則所謂加拉人者。拉車剃頭。賣咖啡茶。皆印人爲之。日本人則男女頗有在此業醫者。亦多也。各人均食於緬甸。滿載而歸。緬日以窮。然因雨量充足。米産木材銀礦寳石出産無量。緬人尙自安樂知足。緬甸大金塔。誠大施主哉。</p>
<p>伊何人。伊何人。而乃與汝攝此駢肩之影。黃曰。此小姊妹喬妝戲攝者。汝以爲誰耶。沈又笑曰。其人安在。亟招之來則氷釋矣。周某仍大呼掃除此賊不已此又一事也。已余問兩事皆親見否。舊雨曰。一聞而一見也。</p>

<p>青　園地</p>
<p>雞鳴寺的一點印象青雨　　正是到南京的第三天、甫東來訪我、相見之下、我們有談不出的種情味、說是快樂罷、我們别離之下、經過三年的别離、各自都有意想不到的變更、形容也多改易、前途尤懐着不可知的揣測、說是有什麽悲苦麽、朋友相見、相視着都還健在、又爲什麽悲苦呢、一時我們都忍住了心中要傾訴的話、不、這時我們是說不出一個所以然來的、我們壓抑往胸懐的蕩動、用普通的態度支持着下來、甫東問我爲什麽來的、</p>
<p>（多久就想對此地來的、加以這次家鄉遭了兵匪的大變故使我不得不走動、便來此了、）</p>
<p>其實在這兒也感不到什麽味道、不過少吃一些驚駭而已、</p>
<p>（不也很合於我的目的嗎、我來也只是想驚駭中休息一下、但是這不是舊的大城嗎、新的首都嗎、古跡的存遺、新興的建設、山川的形勝、我都可借此瞻仰呢、）</p>
<p>（好罷、來了、你自已亦都會知道的、但也就是這麽一回事、不要太高興了、）</p>
<p>他不很興奮似的談着、但他隨即接着又說、</p>
<p>（我們是相别得太久了、今日當然是應當整整相聚一日的、但你願意怎樣消遣這一個可貴的日子呢、）</p>
<p>（隨你調處罷、我是初來的人哪、）</p>
<p>（雞鳴寺消啖去罷我們需要儘量的大家傾吐一回呢、）</p>
<p>說着、我們便出來向北極閣出發、從黃泥岡去北極閣原不是很遠的、自然一會兒就到了、陰陰的天氣之下、經過了一段似新加整理但又似荒凉的現是樹林又覺得太單調的路道、我們便登山了、這時疎疎的雨點已經打下來了、山路上别的人一個也没有、只是樹葉上的雨聲與我們輕微的談話相和着、大約是轉了兩三個灣、瞥見了幾尊破落的神像、我們便到了寺門、寺門口立着灰衣荷槍的人、我便驟然驚了一下因爲我的故鄉風味、便我反應得特别靈敏我以爲是不能進去的、但甫東却早已跨進了寺門、於是我便跟進去、寺内的一切、我不願意來述、到過南京的人、想也没有人不曉得、</p>
<p>我們走進了　　、便傍着一個兩面有窗的桌子坐下、我一看裏面仍是一個人也没有、只有更大的雨在樓外蕭蕭地下着、過了一會才有一位提着水壺、托着點心盒的人來爲我們泡了兩碗茶、我探首向窗外遠望、甫東又指點我那兒是臺城、那兒是天保城、那兒是玄武湖、於是我靜靜地在領略江山勝概、和這清幽寂寞的雨景、甫東不說什麽了、只獨自的喝茶、於是我想着名士出身的梁武帝出來成王定霸、我想到他投身佛門、我又想到他被困於侯景、我稱賞他的英雄、又在悲憐他的愚昧、我更疑心到英雄與愚昧是不是應當聯貫用着的字、不到一刻功夫還是我所憶得起的江南的史跡、都在腦經了轉折了一次、我有什麽感慨呢、我當時是自已分析不出來的、我只覺得心裏有一種意境、這意境似乎不專爲古人而有、而且似乎很痛切的關係我的自身、甚至關係我與甫東再得相見一莊小事、但是我終於没有分辦出來那會與我有什麽關係、</p>
<p>我回頭望甫東了、他背對着窗子坐着、兩隻脚擱在另一個凳子上、眼睛似乎是釘在　樓三個字上、口裏嚼着從我由家鄉帶着來的一塊乾牛肉、他没有知道我在望他、一會之後、他忽然搖一搖頭口裏輕輕地說出一聲、</p>
<p>（不高明、）</p>
<p>爲什麽他忽然發出這三個字的感嘆呢、我忽然奇怪起來、難道他說這個字寫得不好呢、</p>
<p>（唯、你品評着什麽呢、）</p>
<p>（一點也没有想什麽、）他還搖搖頭牛頭不對馬嘴還應我一句、驟然地他忽然命令我說、</p>
<p>（你看這些楹聯罷、爲什麽一定要說六朝金粉呢、爲什麽要大家打起這樣萬刦不復的陳腐腔呢、我們這兒是新的國都啊、）他又不作一聲了、嚼他的牛肉、</p>
<p>我當時閒着、便也將那些聯語念一念看一看那署的名字、確是這時候一點氣息也没有、樓上各樣的裝飾甲對着乙、丙對着丁、各自的發呆、那聯語中各種函義、緊壓着樓上的空氣、自然的凄凉起來、再一遠望湖山城郭、烟雨緊緊的鎖着、使全景成爲一個昏迷的世界、於是一切的勝景、以及一部江南的歷史、又從我胸中消失、便是我現在是在什麽地方、他爲什麽到了這裏、我都不能去思索了、忽而我又想到我的我鄉、我的兵與匪的世界、我的求學的歷程、我的千瘡百孔的生活等等、我也長嘆一聲（我是厭倦了阿）、</p>
<p>甫東立起身來喝了一口茶、笑着對我說、</p>
<p>（其實鷄鳴是可以給他一個新的意義的、風雨如晦、鷄鳴不已、這是應當是爲初建的首都的人、值得三復的兩句話嗎、我再四一想、我們雖然也是飽經滄桑、其實這一世的日子以後還長得很呢、灰得心太早的時候、後半世不是更難過嗎所以生活無論怎樣困憊、也得自已爲自已興奮起來呢、雖然我現在是常從閒暇中找趣味、但閒暇中又時時給我以這樣的懷遠、我總覺得我的分定的一份路道還没有被我走完、</p>
<p>於是他爲我很高興的說他的幾年的經歷、已完全不是來時光景、我也丢開了樓、丢開了景傾注地聽着、我們現在好像看見日光看見草地、看見流水、身上的力量也彷佛從一個小管子注進去地增加着、</p>
<p>雲消日出的時候、我們從寺裏出來穿過那雨後的一過清新的樹林走回去</p>
<h3>夜蘇靈</h3>
<p>哦、彷佛什麽奇怪的聲音吹進頭裏來了、</p>
<p>阿爾志巴綏夫夜</p>
<p>心、如同被活埋在墳墓里的人一樣、抑鬱得要跳到肉體外面來啊、</p>
<p>電燈顫抖着、正如我情緒的煩悶、一樣地顫抖着、夜市的交嚮遠遠地送來、和着樓下二房東們打麻雀的聲音、與外面賣夜食、小販的叫喊、在今夜、呵、這些音響是特别地在我神經上摘擊、</p>
<p>祈禱吧、懇求天父賜予一種力吧、把一個受難的靈魂從苦間的掙扎中救出吧　　我仰望閃爍着星星的黑天、但有什麽用呢、一切理智都失效力、何况虚無的神靈、</p>
<p>我關了電燈、我試想、黑暗也許能使靈魂安靜、</p>
<p>我叫喊、但聲音散落在黑暗没有回響、</p>
<p>我奮怒、我逃出小屋、我逃出小屋、我想打人、我想殺人、而且我想放火、</p>
<p>終於埀着頭、沈默得像一個影子、踏着石子的路、但、石子的路、使我生氣、我要大駡中國的市政、我用皮鞋擊打石子的路、一隊警察從身旁走過、嘘、一排黑狗、忽然、我也想到皮鞋擊打石子的路、是自已的損失、</p>
<p>在一座高樓下面立着、我望着上面的窗子喊、</p>
<p>（阿羅、阿羅、阿羅呀）聲音在牆上亂碰、没有回答、我喪氣地走、我想、</p>
<p>（阿羅也許躱在房裏整理一部創作、故意不答應訪他的人、咄、鬼怪、我也回去努力、努力把那篇（馬蘭小姐）寫完、</p>
<p>但我並没有回回去的路上走、我的靈魂在努喊、</p>
<p>（心啊、暴裂吧、週遭如此寂滅、一切　音好像啞吧的呌　的没有意義、女人、我决計不是需要女人這回事、我需要什麽、我需要地動、不然、我需要看見天蓋覆下來、否則我會悶死、怎麽辦呢、心要跳出來、但肉與骨的牆牢牢地囚着　、暴裂吧、心啊、···）</p>
<p>我走着、忽然我想起要去找我的敵人、我要告訴我的敵人說、</p>
<p>（聽着、我求你聽着、這些一切奇異的夢啊、來吧、我告訴你、你不是我的敵人、我們是好友、你看我的眼淚呀、請你來吻我呢、敵人、我告訴你來、關於她的消息、她已經睡在一個有四百瑰錢一月的男子的懐裏了、你一定相信我不是騙你的、你想、當去年飛着雪的夜裏、我爲什麽不顧生死地往北國長征、如今我南歸了、聽說她也和你離異了、於是我幾次想給你寫一封長信、雖然幾次這封長信都没有寫出來、爲的是怕人家哭、也許是怕你笑、啊、敵人、你聽吧、我來給你嘔吐一切了、這些一切奇異的夢幻、···）</p>
<p>我下了决心、摘開他的門、拖着顫抖的腿子爬上樓梯、</p>
<p>（你没有搬家啊）、我許久以後向他說出這句話、在他房裏還坐着兩個朋友、　　（是的、没有搬、你有什麽事嗎、）</p>
<p>（没有、是的、我去了、）我忽然覺得受了侮辱、逃出他的屋子、他仍在問着、（你有什麽事嗎、）</p>
<p>帶着烘熱的臉、離開了黑弄堂、走入喧囂的街心、女人的桃色的影子幌過、漾着脂粉的香氣、在青年人的意義裏立刻會聯想到性慾上去、商店門口的ＲＡＤＩＯ的燥音響着上海土白的小曲、使人聽了神經會發麻、···）</p>
<p>我立在ＧＯＯＳＥＣＡＦＥ門口、看見一個扭着屁股的舞女上石階、我想跟進去、我躊躇着但我終於只是離開了那裏、</p>
<p>我不需要見着女人、這些、一付一付白色的肉體的動物、有着流動的眼珠的靈巧的嘴吧的東西、扭着屁股的妖精、···</p>
<p>我賭氣地走、抑鬱與煩悶仍盤據在心門、</p>
<p>由閙市走入靜僻的街、我皆背着失望重走向屋裏回來、黑暗的路旁有飢餓的　殻呻吟着、我從衣袋裏抓出一把銅版撒給他們、但是我又　悔、我覺得這種人道主義、慈悲舉動的可笑、</p>
<p>又回到小房子裏來、　亮電燈、</p>
<p>我跌坐在紛亂着紙頭與書本的桌前心裏忽然感覺得憂傷、</p>
<p>夜風吹冷了的頰上、</p>
<p>感到了水子的温熱、</p>
<p>靈魂催眠了···</p>

<h3>新聞文學概論湯增敭</h3>
<p>黃天鵬著</p>
<p>最近一兩年來、國内一般從事新聞業者、大都注意於新文學實際的研求、因爲在新聞事業漸趨於盛興的現代、如果祗依憑著過去服務報界的經騐、與及零星得來的關於新聞學上的常識、當然還不能夠運用自如、至少在理論方面是感到缺乏與苦澀、所以、國外著名的忠誠於新聞事業者、他們除了對於此業具有極形豐富的經騐之外、同時是對於新聞學有深刻的研究、因爲這樣、國外注重於新聞事業的實在我國之後、但是他們發達的速率、實超於我國許多、這種驚人的進展、是稍留心新聞事業的人、都能明瞭無遺的吧、概括的說、就是他們將實際與研究並重、才能演進成今日這樣完美的成績、並且、國外的從事於新聞事業者、大都是在文學上已建築了相當的基礎、或者可以說他們是新聞學專家兼文學家、這是很顯明的事實、可以不用我來舉例了、在我們中國的新聞界、最近呈顯着一種可喜的值得讚美的現象、就是從事新聞事業者、除了運用他們由經歷所得來的常識之外、注重於新聞學專門的研究、這對於中國新聞界的前途、實有莫大的關聯、至少可促進新聞事業的進展、與及有種新的表現、這樣地在學術上努力下去、或許中國的新聞事業、在不久的未來、可以與國外並駕、這亦是必在的現象、尤其使我們引爲欣喜的、就是對於新聞學有專門研究的學者、他們甘願這種研究的心得貢獻於世、委實值得我們的頌揚、關於此、黃天鵬先生可以說是最努力有貢獻的一位、我們祗要看、最近的坊間、出版新聞學論述一類的巨著、最豐富者、無遺地要首推黃先生了、這本（新聞文學概論）一書、實可算是價值最高的一本、我們應該深深地注意一下、</p>
<p>因爲關於新聞學一類的著述、坊間所出版的、大都屬於新聞的編輯法、新聞的採訪法、怎樣才能做新聞記者、與及新聞紙研究等等、這在國外的報壇也是這樣、但是論新聞文學的、實可說是黃先生創始、僅這一點、就可以看出作者的偉大來、關於此類著述、完全是依憑了研究的得所儘量的發揮、簡直没有什麽近於此類的著述可以參考、這些留意於新聞學的人都能夠明白無疑的吧、</p>
<p>全書計分九章、每一章都有正確的立論、精密的見解、第一章（新聞文學導言、）是說本書著述的動機、徴引國外新聞學者的立論爲發端、尤爲可貴可喜、其次、說明料學成立的過程、新聞紙與史學的關係、這一點、在新聞文學上是極形重要、所以作者徴引古今中外的史實爲依據、詳盡異常、對於新聞文學有研究的必要、更其發揮得淋漓盡緻、第二章、（新聞文學之成立、）是說新聞文學最初的雛形、關於此、作者先立論新聞紙的導源、將中國自與日本戰爭之後、陸續出版的（中外記聞）與（時務報）等、及其文章的體格、作者的流派、都加以客觀的論斷、其次、怎樣造成新聞文學的基礎、中國文學大綱、關於新聞文學的紀載、都有所徴引與說明、第三章（新聞文學之特質、）作者爲使讀者易於明白起見、故將新聞文學的特質分爲三點、（一）時間性、（二）通俗性、（三）趣味性、這樣的分析、當然是很有意義的、同時、將這三種性質加以從說明它在文學上的地位與價值、第四章（新聞文學的體裁、）是以歷史爲根據、這當然不易於有所錯誤、如歷來紀事的（一）左傳式、（二）史記式、（三）聊齋式、其次、是將新聞紀事的、（一）提綱法、（二）倒叙法、（三）撮要法、詳加解說、最後、以這三種紀事比較的研究、使讀者明白其優劣、及應該採取的編輯法、第五章（新聞文學之演進、）這章所說甚爲詳盡、計分爲三節、（一）政論時代、（二）新聞時代、（三）副刋文字、（四）結論、尤其是第三節、大都是作者特具的見解、頗能使我們引爲同感的、第六章（新聞文學之變遷）、最先說文學革命的預言、其次說革命運動的經過、最後說新新文學所受影響的種種、這一章、確實極形重要、即使在史學上、關於新聞文學的變遷亦佔有重要的位置、第七章（新聞文學的分類）、第一節小引、（甲）新聞紙上文字約略之類别、（乙）各個特身之性質、（丙）共通的文藝之原則、第二節評論、（甲）評論之意義、（乙）提供問題與注釋新聞、（丙）評論之分類、（丁）最近評論界之三大派别、（戊）評論家之條件、第三節新聞、（一）電報、（甲）拍電須知、（乙）簡明之秘訣、（丙）編電之手續、（丁）專電與外電取捨之例、（二）訪稿、（甲）普通訪稿製作之原理與派别、（乙）新聞描寫技術之要點、（丙）時間空間兩大類之八種方法與實例、（三）通信、（甲）特約通信之内涵與外形、（乙）系統之叙述、（丙）　趣之描寫、（丁）印象之記事、（四）標題、（甲）新聞標題之藝術、（乙）揭示綱要與引人注意、（丙）原則上之四守與四戒、（丁）格式舉隅、（戊）最近之進步觀、第四節餘興文學、（甲）餘興文學之兩大潮流、（乙）現代物質生活之享樂、（丙）人類精神生活之鑒賞、第五節廣告文學、（甲）廣告之新聞價值、（乙）性質、（丙）結搆、（丁）體裁、（戊）標題、（已）種種研究、（庚）新聞文學化之廣告、這一章佔全書的篇幅最多、第節徴引極其詳盡、大都是足以給予我們參考的、第八章（新聞文學之勢力）、關於此章、作者分爲四特點、（一）普遍、（二）繼續、（三）迅速、（四）豐富、與人類足跡之比喻、這種論述、當具有客觀的價值、因爲不將此種勢力說明、讀者必不能、明白新聞文學所特具的地位等等、第九章（新聞文學之將來）、（一）新聞文學之通俗化、（二）新聞文學爲大衆的文學、（三）新聞紙文言白話問題之討論、（四）國語化之新趨勢、這一章、在現今的新聞文學上、實在非常的重要雖然作者對於將來的希望、但亦是目前最須解决的一個重大的問題、然而作者在這裏是發揮得詳盡無遺的了、</p>
<p>總之我們讀了黃先生這部巨著、可</p>
<p>以明白新聞文學上必備的理論基礎、同時新聞紙的勢力、是一天一天的擴大、所以我們對新聞學、實有專心研求的必要、對於國内新聞紙加以改進、應該怎樣的組織精密都是目前必須詳論的事、這部（新聞文學）一書、處處都表現作者特具見解、這顯然是其研求的心得、在我們不得不說他是國内新聞學專著極有價值的一書、希望研究新聞學與愛好新聞學的加以深深的注意、</p>

It is said that the reason for the Japanese side's delay in responding is that a political crisis has occurred in the country. The current cabinet does not dare to reply rashly, fearing that it will give the opposition party grounds for attack. (Special Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

Although the Japanese parliament has just been convened, it will adjourn immediately after the opening. The great competition between the two factions is only in diligently preparing. The political war must wait until after the adjournment period before it begins. This is why the world's political news is becoming increasingly quiet. Moreover, the situation of economic decline is becoming more and more critical. The eyes of people around the world are focused on this point. The authorities of various countries are also doing their utmost to seek ways to improve the situation, provide relief, and maintain stability, and have no time to take care of political measures. This is why political news is becoming increasingly quiet. However, this quiescence of political news is not a standstill, but is actually brewing in the dark. The more dangerous the situation in the economic circles of various countries, the greater its impact on various aspects of politics will be. For those who are in political parties, if they see that the government is unable to reverse this critical situation for a long time, then not only those who are opposed to the government will be angry at the government's incompetence, but even those who have no particular liking or disliking for the government will gradually suspect that the government's measures are not good. As a result, they will inevitably think of creating a new situation to deal with it. This is the common psychology of the world. Therefore, judging from the situation, the more difficult the economic situation is, the more political problems there will be. However, the reason why political news appears to be quiet is that this unprecedented trend is so significant that it is not easy to create a new situation. There is naturally a certain period of brewing, and they dare not act rashly. Therefore, the quiescence of political news today is partly due to the adjournment of parliament and partly due to the brewing not yet being heated. If, once the adjournment period expires and the government is still unable to reverse this situation, then what has been brewed before will inevitably erupt, and the political circles will be turbulent. Then, will the quiescence of political news be broken after the parliaments of various countries begin next year?</p>

<p>Sun Ke Telegraphed Again for the Return of Trains</p>
<p>Chen Tiaoyuan Agreed to Return the Detained Trains Immediately</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke telegraphed Chiang again on the 25th, stating that as of the 20th of this month, a total of 79 locomotives and 1,451 passenger and freight cars had been detained on the Pinghan, Jinpu, Longhai, Jiaoji, Pingsui, and Daoqing railways.

Chiang telegraphed Chen Tiaoyuan, stating that it was reported that he still had two locomotives each from the Pinghan and Jinpu railways and four columns of freight cars, presumably for the purpose of troop deployment.

<h3>The Central Propaganda Department Hosted News Reporters</h3>
<p>Liu Luyin Reported on the Bandit Suppression Situation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Department hosted the press at 2:00 PM on the 25th. Minister Liu Luyin chaired the meeting and reported, saying that after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the Central Committee recognized bandit suppression as the most important task at present. The bandit disasters in the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi originated in the Jinggang Mountains on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi in the 15th and 16th years of the Republic of China. At that time, because the government was paying attention to major national issues, it had no time to take care of it. In addition, the Shanghai Communists often sent people to guide and instigate them. The communist nests were thus established and spread to the Pingjiang and Liuyang areas of Hunan Province. Only today has the government been able to fully suppress the bandits. The Communist Party's policy of fooling the people is to first lure them with benefits and then coerce them. They incite peasants and workers to join the Communist Party. Every time they arrive in a place, they burn houses, extort money, confiscate land, and burn contracts to allow peasants to freely divide the land. They must destroy a place completely before leaving for the second place. They also train children over ten years old to take spears and fight in the front line. Five or six people share a gun. Every time they encounter machine gun fire from the army, a batch dies and another batch continues to come up. After the young children are all dead, they are replaced by rural farmers and old women, making the soldiers feel cold and unwilling to fight again. Then the Red Army officially comes out to attack the army. The Communist Party's secret military tactics are: 1. avoid the real and attack the empty, 2. break up the whole into parts, making it impossible for the army to pursue, 3. turn the parts into a whole, and immediately concentrate their forces to attack cities and rob and devastate the area when they encounter a small number of troops. Except for two or three counties near Nanchang, Jiangxi Province is full of bandits. The population of the entire province has decreased by more than one-third. Hunan Province is better. The bandit disasters in Hubei Province are still hidden and have not yet broken out. Currently, the large army is jointly suppressing the bandits, and Ji'an and Donggu have both been recovered. Luo Lin, Gongcheng Fan, Zhu Shaoliang, Xu Kexiang, and other troops are all very effective. The Communists have no way to escape and have turned the whole into parts and dispersed in all directions to the borders of Hunan, Guangdong, and Fujian. Commander-in-Chief Chiang had already anticipated this and had sent a large army in advance to encircle them from all sides. It is certain that they can be wiped out in the shortest possible time. He hoped that the press would vigorously promote bandit suppression and plead for the people of the three provinces. (Special Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>Anti-Tax Movement Continues</p>
<p>Reuters, New Delhi, 24th - Indian Governor-General Irwin issued a lengthy statement today, explaining that after the expiration of the publication ordinance, newspapers not only failed to comply with the desired restrictions but also incited violence.

The Governor-General also mentioned non-payment of taxes, saying that landlords in the Gujarat region, influenced by non-violent resisters, have refused to pay taxes for several months, with the aim of paralyzing the administration. A similar movement exists in the United Provinces. Therefore, the Indian government has authorized local officials to punish those who incite such actions. Reuters, Rangoon, 24th - Disturbances continue in the Chila Wardy and Insein regions. Rioters have attacked villagers, killing four local government officials.

<h3>Central Government Holds Memorial Service for the Yunnan Uprising</h3>
<p>The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial service for the 15th anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising in the Great Hall at 8:00 AM on the 25th. Attendees included Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Sun Ke, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Boqun, Zhu Peide, Wang Zhengting, Jiao Yitang, Chen Lifu, Shao Yuanchong, Ma Chaojun, Ye Chucang, Zhu Jiahua, Gui Chongji, Li Wenfan, Chen Yaoyuan, Zhang Daopan, and staff from various departments and committees, totaling approximately six to seven hundred people. Zhu Peide presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, Wang Boqun gave a report, stating that the Yunnan Uprising was the greatest commemoration of the struggle to uphold the republic. After the 1911 Revolution, although the overthrow of the autocracy and the racial revolution achieved their goals, the feudal forces in the north and the traditional warlords were not completely eliminated, leading to Yuan Shikai's ambition to restore the imperial system. Fortunately, Comrade Cai Songpo rose up and used Yunnan and Guizhou as the base for opposing Yuan. At that time, many students studying in Japan who opposed the imperial system and important members of the Tongmenghui had relations with Yunnan and Guizhou, sending a large number of revolutionary propaganda materials. Although the inspections along the way were very strict, the movement did not slacken. Yuan Shikai knew that Songpo was not easy to deal with, so he lured him with power, appointing him as the head of the Model Regiment and the head of the Boundary Bureau, and handing over the Yunnan government to Tang Jiyao and the Guizhou government to Liu Xianshi. Songpo pretended to comply on the one hand and secretly worked on the other hand, telling the comrades in Yunnan and Guizhou that although Yuan's troops were numerous, most of them were attracted by money and had no principles. If they fought with troops with principles, it would not be difficult to defeat them in one fell swoop, and they should not be concerned about the disparity in numbers. Therefore, the comrades' determination became stronger. Although Yuan Shikai sent people to persuade the Yunnan troops, they unanimously supported Songpo and supported the uprising. Songpo designed various ways to escape from the tiger's mouth. On December 10, 1915, he rushed to Yunnan, and on the 12th, he convened a meeting of all officers, deciding to uphold the republic and send troops to punish the traitor. After the plan was decided, military deployments were made. Two days before the uprising, a final warning was issued, limiting Yuan Shikai to cancel the imperial system within forty-eight hours. At ten o'clock in the morning on this day fifteen years ago, independence was declared in Yunnan. The troops that rose up in various places advanced at full speed. Songpo, with his perseverance and determination, personally led the First Route Army to capture Chengdu. Because the Sichuan troops had already made contact, they responded in Xufu and divided their forces to contact Chongqing, Hunan, Hubei, and other places to proceed. At this time, Yuan Shikai mobilized nine divisions of troops, sending Cao Kun, Zhang Jingyao, Chen Huan, and others to pressure the southwest. Songpo and the comrades in Yunnan were determined to sacrifice themselves, and the army of more than 40,000 men resisted Yuan's army, which was several times larger, with all their might. In the end, they were able to win with fewer troops. Yuan Shikai died in March of the following year, and the fate of the republic was able to continue. Feng Yuxiang was the first of the Beiyang army to surrender. Songpo ordered him to station in Chengdu. Feng first drove out Chen Huan and Cao Kun, and agreed with Songpo to send a division into Shaanxi from Hanzhong. However, before long, the southern revolutionary troops entered Sichuan, and Feng did not allow it. From this, it can be seen that he was fickle and not worthy of discussing revolution. Now that the traditional forces of the Beiyang warlords have been swept away, and political tutelage is being vigorously implemented, it is hoped that the post-war arrangements will be completed as soon as possible, and that new construction will be completed quickly, so that reactionary forces will be eliminated forever, so as to consolidate the foundation of the country and complete the mission of the Party. After the report, the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Reasons for the Central Government's Recovery of the Salt Surtax</h3>
<p>Salt is a necessary food item, and salt tax is a major national tax. The collection of salt surtaxes by the provinces is prohibited. Since the military uprising, the provinces have had large expenditures, and they often attach surcharges to salt to easily raise large sums of money, regardless of the regulations and arbitrarily collecting taxes. The taxes vary from province to province, and even from county to county. In terms of tax rates, there are unreasonable disparities, resulting in more abuses than revenue. In terms of salt distribution, there is mixing and infiltration, and smuggled salt is everywhere. In terms of people's food, salt prices have risen sharply, and people are eating blandly. In terms of salt fields, there is slow sales and overproduction, and salt workers are in extreme poverty. All kinds of abuses are rampant, and the people are suffering. The people of Henan, Jiangxi, Guizhou, and other provinces have repeatedly telegraphed, calling for reductions, which is an urgent matter. It is impossible to achieve results by dealing with this matter in a piecemeal fashion, and it is not something that can be solved by one province or one region. It is necessary to comprehensively plan for all salt-producing areas in the country, adjust and reduce them in a coordinated manner, so as to achieve balance and achieve practical results. Therefore, it is necessary for the central government to recover the salt surtaxes of the provinces. This is not the central government competing with the provinces for profits, nor is it to delineate national and local taxes. It is for the purpose of reorganizing the salt tax. It is impossible to start without recovery, and it is impossible to improve the tax system and reduce the burden without whole recovery and gradual reduction. The National Government has now instructed the Executive Yuan to forward it to the provinces for compliance, and from March 1, 1931, all provinces will uniformly be transferred to the Ministry of Finance for unified verification and collection. As for the original special expenditures attached to the various provinces, which are temporarily difficult to offset, funds will also be allocated from the national treasury to subsidize them, taking into account all parties, so as to facilitate progress. The Ministry of Finance is now preparing all the necessary measures in accordance with the order.</p>
<h3>Fengyang Customs Ordered to be Abolished</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence - Fengyang Customs is one of the most famous customs in Anhui Province, with jurisdiction over eight branch customs and eleven sub-offices. The eight branch customs are Zhengyang Customs, Bengbu Customs, Lihuai Customs, Huaiyuan Customs, Su County Customs, Gantai Customs, Mingguang Customs, and Hao County Customs. The eleven sub-offices are Mentai Zi Sub-office, Guzhen Sub-office, Fuliji Sub-office, Jiangba Sub-office, Shouhe Sub-office, Xincheng Sub-office, Guandian Sub-office, Zhangbaling Sub-office, Sanjie Sub-office, Hongxiang Sub-office, and Suihe Sub-office. Previously, under the supervisory system, the annual quota was 1.2 million yuan. Since it was changed to the tax affairs department system in March of this year, more than 1.2 million yuan in taxes have been collected in nine months. The Ministry of Finance ordered that from January 1, 1931, all likin and similar transportation surtaxes throughout the country should be abolished. Also, all unified taxes, consolidated donations, special taxes, commodity taxes, railway freight donations, postal package taxes, landing taxes, and positive and miscellaneous taxes and donations that contain the nature of likin, as well as the regular customs taxes and other inland regular customs sub-office taxes, import taxes, etc., outside the fifty li of the customs, should all be permanently abolished by December 31 of this year. After receiving the order, Lu Bin, the tax affairs department officer of Fengyang Customs, is now in the process of finalizing the matter. He has ordered all former staff and officials of the various sub-offices to no longer collect taxes on goods passing through from January 1 of next year. He has also issued a notice today (December 23) so that all merchants and people are aware of it. (December 23)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Abolishes Five Likin Bureaus</h3>
<p>The National Government decided to abolish likin and similar transportation surtaxes on January 1, 1931, and ordered all provinces not to request an extension for any reason. After receiving the order, the Jiangsu Provincial Government immediately instructed the Department of Finance to comply. The Department of Finance stated that the special bureaus for collecting likin and donations in this province that are directly under the jurisdiction of the Department are (1) Wuhu Rice Donation Bureau, (2) Jiangbei Pig Donation Bureau, (3) Songhu Pig Donation Bureau, (4) Songhu Fishery Tax Bureau, and (5) Wusong Sand Fishing Boat Inspection Bureau, a total of five places. It has now been approved by the Provincial Government, and the Department will order each bureau to abolish them within the time limit.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Border Defense and Jiangnan Bandit Traces</h3>
<p>Each Group from Wu and Tan has Arrived in Nanxiong to Deploy Defenses</p>
<p>Each Group from Xiang has Deployed in Xingning and Jiaoling</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The communist bandits near the border of Jiangxi have recently been rampaging in the southeastern part of Jiangxi Province. It is reported that one group led by Zhu De has reached Ningdu County, while Peng Dehuai's group has fled to Yudu County, and Mao Zedong's group has also escaped from Shaxi towards Ruijin County. Huang Gonglue's group, on the other hand, is scattered and hidden in the San'nan area of Jiangxi. The puppet Fourth Army of Zhu De has been sending people to the Beijiang area of Guangdong Province for days, trying to incite local collaborators to act as internal support. On the 12th of this month, in the Xintang market town, which is sixty miles outside Nanxiong City, a gathering of seven or eight hundred communist bandits, half of whom were local bandits and half of whom were communists, openly established a Soviet Military Commission in the area. Those local collaborators engage in seeking revenge, arson, and murder daily. The villagers in nearby villages have mostly moved away. However, in Nanxiong City, reinforcements have been arriving for days, and the city's county soldiers have launched separate attacks, killing many bandits. The remaining bandits have fled towards Xinfeng County. The Tan Langxing Regiment and a portion of the Wu Jianxiong Regiment arrived in Nanxiong City on the 14th and 15th, respectively. The Tan Regiment immediately dispatched a battalion to Dayu County to maintain vigilance. Key passes such as Dadi Fort and Tang Village in Dayu County are jointly defended by the county's militia and police. Upon hearing the news, most of the border bandits fled back to Nankang County. The Wu Jianxiong Regiment left a battalion to garrison in Shixing County. Huang Yanzhen, the brigade commander of the 125th Brigade, established an office in Shaozhou after arriving there. He conducted an inspection in the Nanshi area and returned to Shaozhou on the 15th. Currently, there are two special operations battalions brought by Huang, stationed in the suburbs of Shaozhou City, while the brigade's special operations battalion is stationed inside the headquarters. The Huoshan and Jizu Mountains outside the city are guarded by a battalion from the Third Independent Regiment under Deng Hui. In recent days, many refugees from southern Jiangxi have arrived in Shaozhou City, begging in groups, their condition extremely miserable. They claim that they were all members of the property-owning class in Jiangxi Province a few months ago. Recently, communist bandits have repeatedly captured cities, burned down houses, and plundered their property, so they have come from afar to beg for food. It is also said that the communist disaster in southern Jiangxi was most severe in Ji'an, with losses of millions of dollars and tens of thousands of people homeless, truly an unprecedented catastrophe. It is reported that the authorities, seeing that the communist bandits in Jiangxi had the intention of fleeing east, have discovered traces of bandits in Xunwu and Yudu. In addition to ordering the Cai and Dai divisions to pursue and suppress them, they have also telegraphed Xiang Hanping's division in eastern Guangdong to quickly deploy defenses along the border. The Xiang division commander inspected Dabu yesterday and transferred Li Zhenliang's regiment to Luogang in Xingning County to guard Xunwu, while Chen Ju's regiment was stationed in Jiaoling County to guard the Fujian border. According to recent reports from Xunwu, the main forces of Zhu De and Mao Zedong are currently rampaging in Ningdu and Donggu, which belongs to Xingguo County. The central government's Zhang Huizan and Mao Bingwen divisions arrived in Xingguo County along the Nanfeng-Guangchang area, while Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai's divisions arrived in Gan County, and the remaining five divisions are stationed along the Gan River, currently jointly encircling the communist bandits. In recent days, the Cai and Dai divisions have been advancing rapidly. According to a telegram on the 14th, the Cai division captured Wu Yuanzai, the company commander of the puppet independent division, in Lianhua, and defeated two or three hundred communist bandits, killing more than twenty. They also defeated more than a thousand communist bandits in Yongxin, and captured Chen Xiu, the head of the puppet Red Guards, Yin Yuwen, a member of the puppet Soviet government, Zhou Wenshan, the minister of culture, and Peng Yukai, a puppet detective. The bandits fled towards Fu'an. The headquarters (the 19th Route Army Headquarters) and the Cai division advanced towards Wan'an on the 15th, while the Dai division advanced towards Taihe. In addition, Cai Tingkai, the commander of the Cai division, received a telegram from the front yesterday stating: "(1) The Peng bandits are rampaging between Guangchang and Ningdu, the Zhu bandits are rampaging near Ningdu, and the Mao bandits are rampaging in the Shaxi-Donggu-Chenggang area; (2) Our 9th Route Army is encircling and suppressing Donggu and Ningdu along the Ji'an-Jishui-Yongfeng-Le'an line, and our 6th Route Army is encircling and suppressing Donggu and Ningdu along the Yihuang-Dongpo line; (3) Our Ma Kun Brigade is in Ganzhou, and our army (the 19th Route Army) will completely arrive in Yongxin today (the 16th); (4) The Qu Brigade and Yun Regiment will continue to advance this morning, and the remaining troops will follow tomorrow morning, arriving in Wan'an around the designated day to await orders, and the Dai (Ji) division will continue to advance tomorrow morning (the 17th morning), arriving in the Tantouzhen area of Taihe around the designated day to await orders.

<h3>The Reaction to Qingdao's Increased Land Tax</h3>
<p>Citizens Send Representatives to Petition for Exemption</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Agrees to Consider Postponing the Implementation</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The Qingdao Municipal Government's Finance Bureau recently sent a letter to the General Chamber of Commerce, requesting the nomination of two members for the Private Land Evaluation Committee, which is scheduled to be formally established by the end of this month, in order to re-determine the land tax rate and increase revenue. The General Chamber of Commerce convened meetings of various members and landowners twice, but without any results. At 2:00 PM on the 22nd, the third meeting was held at the General Chamber of Commerce, with over a thousand attendees. Ding Jingchen, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, presided over the meeting. Everyone agreed that in this time of economic recession, the current private land tax rate is already high, and they cannot afford to bear any additional burden. The public finds it difficult to accept the issue of electing members to organize the evaluation committee. Even the rental rights for government-owned land are harmful to the people and should be abolished. It was agreed to send representatives to petition the authorities to completely eliminate the plan. The entire assembly unanimously passed the motion and elected forty representatives, including Ye Chunchi, to go to the municipal government to petition at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. The municipal government held a temporary meeting that was delayed until 3:30 PM. Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng, Finance Bureau Director Guo Binghe, and Xiong Shubin, the third section chief of the Finance Bureau, received the representatives. After the representatives stated their intentions, they said that they had already paid rent for the land. The additional rental rights fee is like buying land, and it is difficult to bear the burden of paying for both new leases and renewals. The current tax rate for private land is 6%. According to the Finance Bureau's regulations, the best land is 38 yuan per square foot, which is several times higher than the original price, which is too high. Therefore, they asked for consideration of the situation and for the cancellation of the plan. Secretary-General Hu and the representatives had a thorough discussion. He said that the rental rights fee has been in place for a long time and no problems have occurred. If it is canceled, it will only increase disputes. This issue should be discussed at length after the mayor returns to Qingdao. The re-evaluation of private land can be postponed temporarily. It will be implemented after the national land law is promulgated. The representatives, seeing that the petition had achieved results, took their leave and departed. (December 24th)</p>
<h3>The Jinan Telephone Company Appeal Case Opens (Continued)</h3>
<p>Next, the agent of the respondent, Yoshida, expressed his views, which were translated by Ugaji Takao. He stated briefly that he requested the dismissal of the appeal and that the appellant bear the appeal costs. The appellant claimed: (1) The director had no authority to sign the contract; (2) Ma Guanhe colluded with Dongtuo. These points will be debated in eight sections. First, the general manager is the director of the legal entity, and the director has the authority to represent the legal entity. Article 27 of the General Principles of the Civil Code, which your country has promulgated, has this provision. Ma Guanhe, the principal debtor in this case, is both a director and the general manager, which is not disputed by both parties. According to Article 13 of the telephone company's articles of association, the general manager has the power to execute all matters. Also, according to Article 158 of the Company Law, the director can represent the company. With these various provisions, the general manager has the authority to borrow 440,000 yuan. The director's seal has legal effect. Second, the appellant argues that Article 199 of the Company Law stipulates that company bonds cannot be raised without a resolution of a special board meeting. However, Articles 190 to 198 all relate to the regulations of company bonds. The case involves common debt, not company bonds, so it cannot be restricted. Third, the appellant argues that Ma Guanhe had no authority to borrow money. However, Ma is the general manager and director. According to the company's articles of association, there are no restrictions on the director's authority. Therefore, even though this case involves a joint guarantee, he still has the authority. Furthermore, this debt is for operating capital, and the directors are all aware of it. Therefore, there are no shortcomings in Dongtuo's case. The appellant also argues that Ma Guanhe's actions were improper and detrimental to the telephone company. This is an internal matter. The appellant can request Ma to compensate, but it cannot restrict this case. Therefore, the original judgment, which stated that if Ma Guanhe, as the general manager and director, has harmed the company, it cannot be transferred to a third party, is very accurate. Fourth, the appellant argues that this loan was not introduced by a third party and that Ma Guanhe and Dongtuo handled it secretly. It was not filed with the Chinese authorities, but only with the Japanese consulate, which means that Dongtuo was unwilling to file it. This is worthless because the presence or absence of a third party has no impact on the loan. Whether it is filed with the authorities or not also has no relationship to the loan. Moreover, there was indeed an introducer at the time, and the reason it was not filed with the national authorities was that your country did not have a registration law at the time, so it was only filed with the Japanese consulate. Therefore, this case is by no means secret. Fifth, the appellant argues that the loan is outside the scope of business. However, this loan is for expanding the telephone company's business, which is clearly within the scope of business. Dongtuo trusted the telephone company's articles of association, so it made this loan. The appellant is naturally responsible. If Ma Guanhe borrowed the money with malicious intent, the telephone company should directly hold Ma Guanhe accountable, and it should not involve a third party. Sixth, the appellant argues that the disposition of all collateral in the contract violates laws and regulations. However, according to the principle of freedom to enter into contracts, it can be established as long as it does not violate good morals and public order. All the collateral was approved by the directors. Because of the large amount of 440,000 yuan, Dongtuo had to require collateral. At that time, your country did not have an auction law, so the contract could only state free auction. As for giving priority to employing Japanese people and the loan matters, both parties agreed at the time, and it has nothing to do with the debt. Seventh, the appellant argues that Article 9 of Regulation 135 of the Ministry of Transportation regarding privately established telephones stipulates that if a private telephone is auctioned, both parties must report to the Ministry of Transportation, otherwise it is invalid. The appellant claims that the respondent and Ma Guanhe privately entered into the agreement without reporting it to the Ministry of Transportation, so it is not valid. This article refers to the regulations for sales contracts and does not apply to this case. Eighth, in summary, can the appellant prove that Ma Guanhe was not a director and general manager at the time of the loan? Is there proof that the respondent colluded with Ma Guanhe? The respondent recognized that Ma had the authority to represent the company. The contract he signed with a third party is valid. Therefore, the appellant must be fully responsible for this debt. The appellant's appeal is completely unreasonable. The presiding judge asked, "In the first volume, there is a handwritten letter from Ma Guanhe stating that the loan has nothing to do with the telephone company. What year was it?" Yan Chenghan replied, "It was the sixteenth year, when Ma was the director of the Zhili Finance Bureau. An Shanzhi questioned him about this." (The judge took the letter for Yoshida to read.) Yoshida said, "It is not known whether this letter was written after Ma and the telephone company reconciled. Even if it is true, it was written under duress." The judge asked, "Is the term five years?" Yoshida said, "It is fifteen years. After the term expired, there were several negotiations at the Foreign Affairs Office." Yan Chenghan replied, "The telephone company is unaware." Yoshida then presented Ma's handwritten letter, a business card from the telephone company's general affairs, and an insurance policy. Yan Chenghan replied, "The evidence is insufficient. Even if it is true, it cannot obligate the telephone company to repay the debt." At this point, the testimony was read, signed, and the court was adjourned. (December 20th)</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Welcomes Yu Youren</h3>
<p>And Welcomes the Entire Provincial Party Committee</p>
<p>Xi'an Dispatch: Yu Youren arrived in Xi'an yesterday (the 18th). Yang Hucheng and others welcomed him outside Zhongshan Gate and set up his residence in Zhang Xiangchu's house in Juhuayuan. Today (the 19th), various circles held a grand welcome meeting for President Yu at the New City Drill Ground. Because the entire Provincial Party Committee had also arrived in Shaanxi, they also welcomed the entire Provincial Party Committee members at the same time. All agencies, organizations, schools, and troops participated. The meeting opened at 12:00 noon. Nan Ruji delivered the opening address, stating briefly that they had originally planned to hold three separate welcome meetings for President Yu, the Party Committee, and the Provincial Committee. However, because time is precious, they are welcoming President Yu and the entire Provincial Party Committee members at the same time today. Next, Yang Hucheng delivered a welcome speech, stating briefly that Shaanxi was able to break through Tongguan in the shortest possible time and end the war. On the surface, it was due to the efforts of the armed comrades who entered Shaanxi. However, the reason why this result could be achieved was due to the revolutionary seeds sown by President Yu in Shaanxi and the revolutionary talents cultivated. In the future, they still hope that President Yu will guide everything so that they have something to follow. Now that the Party Provincial Committee has arrived in Shaanxi, a new Shaanxi can be realized in the future. Next, Ma Qingwan delivered a welcome speech, describing the three periods of Yu's revolution in Shaanxi. Next, Zhao Yuru, the president of Zhongda, delivered a welcome speech, hoping that Yu and the Provincial Party Committee would work hard to build a truly new Shaanxi. Kang Jiyao then delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the people, stating briefly that any undertaking should be carried out with compassion. Next, Yu delivered a reply, stating briefly that he did not dare to accept the welcome. He is a Shaanxi commoner with a beard. He leads all the people of Shaanxi in welcoming the Provincial Party Committee members who are attending the meeting today. Shaanxi has been barren and drought-stricken as never before. According to foreign investigations, approximately two million famine victims have died. At present, there are starving people everywhere. Fortunately, Director He (Yingqin) proposed at the Fourth Plenary Session to allocate 8 million yuan in relief loans to Shaanxi. My request is only a share of the majority and not the power of me alone, so please do not spread false rumors. I also have two proposals: (1) All employees serving in Shaanxi should wear black gauze on a certain day to commemorate the disaster and hope that such a great disaster will never happen again. (2) Pray to the spirit of the Premier in Heaven and all the gods of Heaven and Earth, so that all the Shaanxi children who have escaped the disaster, been sold to the outside of the pass, and are wandering can have good circumstances. I have returned to Shaanxi several times, but the results have always been tears. The great disaster in Shaanxi means that I cannot evade my fault. Fortunately, the revolutionary army and the revolutionary comrades have now arrived in Shaanxi. This time, I may be able to leave the pass and return to Beijing with a smile. Next, Yu Guozhen of the Party Committee gave a reply, discussing the disasters, banditry, suffering of the people in Shaanxi, and the crimes of Feng in Shaanxi, in a very thorough manner. Next, Li Fanyi of the Provincial Committee gave a speech, stating briefly that he believes that the committee members who have come to Shaanxi this time will never exploit the people of Shaanxi. Next, Hu Yimin of the Provincial Committee gave a speech, saying that the disaster in Shaanxi is due to both man-made and natural disasters. However, the fact that the people of various counties in western Shaanxi like to grow opium is an important reason. I will never give up my responsibilities and vow to eradicate this poison. Finally, Nan Ruji reported on accepting Yu's two proposals. Then, they shouted slogans and dispersed. (December 19th)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Japanese Reporter's Slander of the Harbin Prison</h3>
<p>Our Negotiating Representative Lodges a Protest</p>
<p>The Harbin Press Association Investigates the Truth</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Regarding the matter of a Japanese Dentsu News Agency reporter stationed in Harbin fabricating rumors and slandering the prison, on the 18th of this month, the negotiating representative Zhong Yu lodged a protest with the Japanese consul stationed in Harbin. At the same time, the prison authorities sent telegrams to the Capital Judicial Administration Yuan and the Jilin Higher Court, explaining the facts in detail. They also issued a declaration, stating: "The ten articles of the declaration issued by the Japanese Press League on December 16th are pure fabrications. Based on the facts, we refute them as follows. Prisons are executive agencies for criminal defendants and are subject to the review of the original sentencing agency. If a prisoner is ill, the original sentencing agency is notified. If a prisoner dies, it must be examined by an investigating prosecutor. There are registers for the daily entry and exit of prisoners, and records of their daily lives and actions. When they are ill, they are treated by doctors, and after death, their bodies are claimed by their relatives. Even if they are handled by the prison, they must be sent to the charity grounds and buried with markings. The Japanese press declaration falsely accuses prisoner Wang of various situations without specifying which agency sentenced him, where he was buried after death, or the names of the guards who beat the prisoners. If sixty people are on hunger strike for five days, there must be starvation and discontent. Why is it that none of the nine hundred prisoners know about it? On the 10th, Hideaki Kuramoto personally visited and inspected various places. It would be clear at a glance whether prisoners were on hunger strike and whether the prison had other places to house and resist prisoners. The declaration is a complete fabrication and is extremely vile. The accusation that the warden spent three days trying to cover up the matter is also false. On the 11th, 12th, and 13th of this month, people came to the prison every morning, and the warden met them with sincerity, which is enough to show the hypocrisy of the Japanese press. As for the accusation that the afternoon newspaper on the 13th had words criticizing the prison, a full copy of the afternoon newspaper on the 13th has been examined, and it can be seen that the League is fabricating something out of thin air. Motohashi came in person to apologize and drafted a revised telegram, which was translated into Chinese by the secretary Kuramoto. There was no request from the warden. The false accusation of a certain high-ranking Chinese official speaking out should also be pointed out so that it can be proven. This case is of great importance and cannot be resolved by frivolous and unfounded arguments. The Japanese reporter said that he had heard rumors. The declaration also falsely claimed that a high-ranking Chinese official spoke out. In order to clarify the true and accurate facts, we request that those with knowledge of prison studies and law from all countries organize a group to come to the prison to investigate. If it is true, the prison staff will be duly punished. If it is not true, the newspapers affiliated with the Japanese League should also be punished accordingly, so as to show justice to the world. This is the only appropriate course of action." On the afternoon of the 17th, the Harbin Press Association, believing that this matter was of great importance to the recovery of our country's legal rights, sent representatives Zhang Shuping and Lin Xiaotian to visit the prison and the prosecutor's office on the 18th to inquire about the truth and personally entered the prison cells to ask the prisoners about what happened. A report was drafted and submitted to the Press Association for review. (December 20th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Prepares to Abolish the Currency System</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Orders Border Counties to Strictly Prevent Infiltration</p>
<p>Jilin Dispatch: Quan Shien, the consul-general stationed in Heihe, Russia, has been reporting on Russian affairs from time to time. Recently, the provincial government received a letter from the consul detailing the Soviet Union's preparations to abolish the currency system. Excerpts are as follows: "Since the implementation of the Soviet Union's New Economic Policy, various industries have been exclusively operated by the state, and the products produced and sold abroad are also government monopolies. As for distribution within the country, private merchants could initially purchase and resell from state-owned stores or the original factories producing the goods. In recent years, the management of state-owned stores in the country has gradually become complete, and their capacity is sufficient to meet the needs of the country. Therefore, they have successively bankrupted private merchants through heavy taxation policies and administrative methods. All stores in urban and rural areas that are not entirely state-owned are jointly operated by the government and certain social organizations. Their business is mainly to distribute various goods to workers in factories and staff in government agencies, and not to make a profit. The method is to designate someone in need to be supplied by a certain official store, and to order the supplied person to pay a certain amount of fees, and then the store will issue a small booklet. In the future, they can use this booklet to receive goods. All those who have obtained this type of booklet are personnel serving in various government agencies and factories. Ordinary merchants and civilians do not have the right to obtain this type of booklet. However, if ordinary people need certain goods and daily necessities, they can exchange them for food, leather, and other raw materials with the Far East National Trade Company or various consumer cooperatives in the countryside. Since this method has been implemented, the use of banknotes in the country has gradually narrowed. In order to prepare for the implementation of the abolition of the currency system and complete absolute communist politics, the Soviet government is now ordering that transactions between various state-owned agencies do not use cash. When various enterprises or agencies have deposits, they must be sent to the National Bank for deposit. For example, when Agency A buys goods from Agency B, it does not directly pay in cash. It only needs the National Bank to deduct the payment from A's deposit and deposit it into B's account, and the transaction is completed. As for the wages of workers in various factories and the salaries of staff in government agencies, it is also planned not to give them cash. The plan is to give them half in food and daily necessities, which they can receive with the small booklet of the official store, and the remaining half of their salary will be deposited by the service agency in the savings bank. It is said that there are no restrictions when withdrawing the money. This is the prelude to the Soviet Union's preparation to abolish the currency system. In recent years, the country's industrial and commercial enterprises have been completely controlled by the government. Transactions between state-owned agencies using cash or being cleared by the bank have the same effect. Furthermore, the Soviet government regards money as a medium for private capital. If state capital occupies the main part of the entire economy, then the function of money has already lost most of its significance. Moreover, for years, state-owned commercial agencies in the country have been exchanging agricultural products and raw materials produced in rural areas for factory products with farmers. Otherwise, no matter how much paper money is given, they will not sell. Paper money has long ceased to have any significant impact on the country's enterprises and economy. Those who use paper money are mostly private capital, but private capital is precisely what communist politics does not tolerate. If private capital is cracked down on, the Soviet government will naturally take resolute measures without hesitation, so long as it does not cause economic panic. This is why the Soviet government is preparing to abolish money. The above is the Soviet Union's domestic situation. If we talk about the external aspect, the Soviet paper currency has been prohibited from leaving the country since it was issued. In theory, there should be no Soviet paper currency abroad. If there is, it is only considered a private currency that has been illegally taken out of the country, and the Soviet Union is not responsible for its exchange. The country's foreign trade, because the major powers do not trust the national paper currency, all demand cash or other countries' redeemable paper currency. Therefore, when the Soviet Union purchases machinery and other types of goods abroad, it uses cash or the foreign currency obtained from the sale of exports as the price for purchasing foreign goods. The Soviet paper currency has never been able to be used conveniently abroad, and even if it is abolished, it will naturally not have any impact on foreign relations. This is the situation of the Soviet Union's economic changes and the trend of the country to abolish the currency system." After receiving the report, the provincial government, fearing that the border areas would be invaded by Soviet private currency and that merchants and civilians would suffer, yesterday issued a special order to all border counties, ordering them to pay close attention to this matter.

<h3>Liaoning Province to Establish a Match Monopoly Bureau</h3>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Zhang Zhenhuai, the Director of Finance, in order to promote domestically produced matches and recover rights and interests, plans to establish a Match Monopoly Bureau. The Northeast Political Affairs Committee has approved a trial run. The department is now actively proceeding. It is said that the internal organization of the Monopoly Bureau plans to have one director, to be concurrently held by the Director of Finance, and two sections below. Each section will have one section chief. The number of staff will be temporarily set at five per section. The increase will be considered depending on the complexity of the affairs in the future. The location is still under discussion. All the organizational regulations and detailed rules of the Monopoly Bureau have been drafted by the Finance Department and submitted to the provincial government for approval. However, since the Northeast prepared for the match monopoly, Japanese merchants have been in a panic. The Japanese Consul General in Shenyang sent a note to the Foreign Affairs Office, requesting that the process be stopped. The provincial government, based on the report from the Foreign Affairs Office, submitted it to the provincial government meeting for discussion. It was decided that the Foreign Affairs Office should first examine the original text of the Treaty of Wangxia, sign it, submit it to the next meeting for discussion, and then refute it. It is also reported that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is scheduled to hold a national match conference in Beijing on the 21st of this month. After receiving the notice, the Northeast Match Industry Association has sent Han Dongping, the secretary of the association, as a representative to attend the meeting in Beijing. (December 21st)</p>
<h3>Victory in Suppressing Bandits in Southern Anhui</h3>
<p>Over Two Thousand Bandits Dispersed</p>
<p>From Wuhu Communication: In the counties of Langxi, Guangde, and Xuancheng in southern Anhui, dense forests abound. Coupled with last year's drought and hardship for the people, bandits seized the opportunity to secretly establish bogus organizations, coercing and luring good citizens to join their ranks, resulting in bandits everywhere. Although numerous searches and suppressions have been conducted, it has been difficult to completely eliminate them. The bandit leader, Wang Jinlin, is from Guangdong. Recently, he gathered over two thousand bandits, fully armed, and entrenched himself in Tonggou, Taibaogou, and other places. The residents of Langxi and Guangde counties have become a bandit world due to oppression and temptation. A few days ago, they brazenly broke into Xiyao Village in western Guangde, confiscating the guns of the militia, and then attacked the Bai Dian militia, aiming to seize their weapons. Yu Fengrun's entire 342nd Regiment of the 57th Division is stationed in Langxi and Guangde counties. They immediately left two companies to be responsible for the defense of Guangde and Langxi county towns. The remaining twelve infantry companies, as well as mortar and machine gun companies, simultaneously set out from Langxi, Guangde, Shijie Ferry, and other places in several directions, and established contact with the militia, launching a large-scale encirclement. They encountered a large number of bandits in Yaocun and Daliucun, and a conflict ensued. The bandits were driven to Qingfeng Ridge. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 AM the day before yesterday, the bandits, with no way to escape in all directions, suddenly launched a counterattack against Yu's regiment. Yu's regiment also seized the opportunity to bombard them. After a day of fierce fighting and several charges, the bandits finally collapsed on all sides. The bandit leader Wang Jinlin fled in disarray with only forty or fifty men. No less than several hundred bandits were killed by artillery fire. Two wooden cannons, a large number of homemade guns and broadswords were seized, and over forty hostages were rescued. Yu's regiment also lost thirteen soldiers, and two officers were wounded. It was not until yesterday that the various troops returned to their original defenses. All sectors of Guangde specially raised 1,000 yuan to reward the officers and soldiers of the regiment who had contributed. Regiment Commander Yu also telegraphed the details of the bandit suppression to the brigade headquarters of the 171st Brigade stationed in Wuhu. (23rd)</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Appeal from Pawnshops in Various Counties of Jiangsu Province. Pawnshops in various counties of Jiangsu Province cite Article 16 of the newly promulgated Jiangsu Provincial Pawnshop Regulations, which states that if the redemption of pawned items is overdue by more than five days, a half-month's interest will be charged, and if it is overdue by more than fifteen days, a month's interest will be charged, with a fixed date of January 1, 1921 for implementation. The Construction Department has instructed pawnshops in various counties to comply. Pawnshops believe that the change to collecting half a month's interest will cause excessive losses to the pawnshop industry and make it unable to sustain itself. Although the Provincial Pawnshop Association has repeatedly fought for this, it has been ineffective. Pawnshop associations in thirteen counties of Jiangsu Province, including Taixing, Dongtai, Wujiang, Kunshan, Songjiang, Dantu, Wuxian, Wujin, Jiangyin, Yixing, Liyang, Changshu, and Wuxi, initiated a letter inviting representatives from pawnshops in various counties to hold a temporary meeting of representatives from pawnshops across the province in the county chamber of commerce on the day before yesterday (the 22nd). They resolved to organize a temporary office for pawnshops in various counties of Jiangsu Province to handle this case, appealing to the province to request a postponement of implementation in order to maintain commercial hardship. The submission of this document to the province was completed yesterday.</p>
<p>Long-distance Telephone Lines in Nine Counties to Establish Three Exchanges in Wuxi. The long-distance telephone lines in nine counties, including Suwu, Xiyi, etc., were being actively prepared by Deng Fubei, Director of the Telecommunications Administration, under the order of the Construction Department. All necessary materials have been purchased and are being carried out separately. Now, Director Deng came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to contact Yao Dixing, Director of the Construction Bureau, believing that the equipment in various counties will be completed soon. It was decided to establish three exchanges in Wuxi, one in the County Government, one in the Public Security Bureau, and one in the Construction Bureau. The telephone poles and lines are planned to be borrowed from the Wuxi Telephone Company.</p>
<p>Decision to Add a City Gate at Jixiang Bridge. The County Government held its 70th county administration meeting yesterday and decided on the following important matters: (1) Feng Junyan, the Chief of the Sixth District, reported that it was difficult to raise funds for setting up telephones in several villages. It was proposed to use the cash from the Second and Fifth Treasury bonds stored in the district. It was decided to instruct the respective district chiefs to submit a detailed report on the use of funds for further review. (2) Regarding the County Party Department's request to add a city gate at Jixiang Bridge, it was decided to instruct the Municipal Property Committee and the Construction Bureau to survey and deliberate separately. (3) The regulations for widening the existing roads in Wuxi City were approved as amended according to the review report.</p>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Healed and Discharged from the Hospital. 109 wounded and sick soldiers from the 22nd Rear Hospital stationed in Wuxi were healed and discharged from the hospital yesterday. The hospital director, Cai Xiafu, sent a letter to the station to prepare two cars for the transportation of the discharged wounded and sick soldiers to Beijing for return to their units, and also sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to send police to take care of them.</p>
<p>The Pitiful Chen Guiying was Abducted to Xiamen. Chen Jinfu, who lives next to the electric light factory on Dongxin Road, outside Guangfu Gate, his daughter Guiying worked in a silk factory. In the autumn of this year, she was abducted to Xiamen by three men from the factory whose names are unknown and sold to the Xia Yung Ge brothel as a prostitute. The girl, unwilling to engage in the flesh trade, went to the Xiamen Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance. The bureau ordered the police to summon Wu Wangshi, the owner of Xia Yung Ge, to the bureau. Wu Wangshi confessed that the girl was brought by Chen Fulin. The bureau, because the case involved a report of abduction, immediately transferred the case to the Siming County District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Later, a letter was sent to the County Government of this county, requesting the police to notify the girl's father, Chen Jinfu, to come and identify her. After the county government approved the letter, yesterday a notice was prepared and police were sent to inquire, but there was no household of Chen Jinfu. It is thought that he has moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>Taxation Agencies to be Abolished at the End of the Year. The Wuxi Taxation General Office of this county received instructions from the Jiangsu Financial Commissioner's Office the day before yesterday, stating that the subordinate collection agencies should be abolished by December 31, 1921. After receiving the order, the office, because the subordinate branches had previously solicited short-term treasury bonds for customs duties for the 19th year, all of which were printed and collected by the Special Commissioner's Office, is now rushing to handle the closure. A letter was sent to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday, asking them to notify all industries to come to the office to exchange treasury bonds. After the deadline, the unissued treasury bonds will be submitted to the Special Commissioner's Office for verification and issuance. The office will not be responsible after the abolition.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Military and Police Go to Huangtu to Suppress Bandits. Chuan Zengyi, the company commander of the 7th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Military Police 2nd Regiment stationed in Wu County, was ordered to go to Huangtu, Jiangyin to suppress bandits on the morning of the 24th at 1:00 AM, together with Chen Tianxi, the police captain. It happened that the bandit leader Xu Linlin forced a kidnapped maiden into marriage at home that day. Comrades and guests filled the house. The military and police went to surround the house and captured Xu and others under the bed in the new house. Xu dared to suddenly rush out and shoot with a gun, attempting to resist arrest and escape. The military police immediately fired back, killing him and dragging him out of the bed. A Mauser pistol and five bullets were found. The military and police, believing that the suspect was indeed a bandit leader, cut off his head and captured eleven accomplices, including Cai Hongqing, in the house. Together with the head, they were taken to the city that afternoon. The police also arrested the bandit suspect Xu Yaoliang in Panshu and brought him to the city together. Xu's head was hung on the gate as a warning to the public. The remaining bandits are under preliminary investigation.</p>

Upon receiving the news, County Magistrate Wu prepared to conclude all matters.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Contested Alluvial Land Leads to Litigation. In 1922, the Fuli Company invested in the Duan Shan South Clamp Tapping Garden Beach. The three embankments collapsed, and by May 1923, the company's assets were exhausted. It owed a large sum of money to the mud workers, but had no funds to pay them. Therefore, 7,500 mu of beach land was allocated, with 6,000 mu allocated to the mud workers, one mu per worker as payment, and the remaining 1,500 mu allocated to the mud work foremen and office staff as salaries. Zhu Tingyan represented the negotiations. After the embankment was completed, the weaker mud workers reluctantly sold their land rights to local landlords, and made agreements with the company to designate land sections for collecting rent. However, there are still genuine mud workers who have not sold their land rights for eight years, but still cannot collect rent from even one mu. Therefore, this spring, Zhu Tingyan, as a representative, clarified the boundaries according to the company's records, and the holders of land rights built embankments themselves. Some people, including Zhu Tingqiu, citing the cases of the Houde Company, Tang An, Zhang An, and Xinbao An, accused Zhu Tingyan and others of seizing embankments. The county government repeatedly summoned them for questioning. Now that winter has arrived and the water is low, Zhu Tingyan and others have divided the embankment land and are repairing the banks for each management section. Several dozen mu of land in the East-West beach area of the Chaodong Weigang section head were assigned to Yu Shangyi, Xu Jinxiu, and Wang Chuan to repair the banks. Chen Jiyu, Zhu Jiadong, and Wu Gengyang believe that this hinders their new case, and have filed a complaint with the county accusing Zhu Tingyan, Yu Shangyi, and others of seizing the embankment. On the 23rd, the county summoned them for questioning. Zhu Jiadong and others stated that the area Zhu Tingyan was embanking was the area they had reported in 1926, had received land ownership certificates, and had repeatedly reported to the county, requesting the police to order a stop to the construction, but the report was ignored and the construction continued. Ding Shipu, commissioned by Zhu Tingyan, and Yu Shangyi and others stated that the embankment area was the address reported by the Fuli Company, and they had submitted it to the Sandfield General Bureau and forwarded it to the two provincial governors of Jiangsu, informing the Ministry of Finance to restrict the reporting of new cases by a second company or individual. Chen Jiyu reported the case in 1926, four years after the settlement of the Fuli embankment case, and the location was also within the scope, which was an illegal seizure. They also submitted a detailed map of the boundary. The court ordered a further summons for questioning.</p>
<p>Court Hearing of the Case of the Market Strike by Merchants and Residents in Ligang. In Ligang Town, 6th District, the merchants and residents went on strike because Gu Shijia, the leader of the 1st Squad of the County Police Force stationed there, used plainclothes police to arrest gamblers. On the 23rd, the county government summoned Deputy Regiment Commander Xu Qin'an, Squad Leader Gu Shijia, and patrol officers Ding Changqing and Liu Tongfa for questioning. Xu Qin'an testified that at 10:00 AM on November 27th, plainclothes police came to the town to arrest gamblers. He happened to be coming out of the store and asked what was happening. He was then beaten by patrol officers Ding Changchun and Liu Tongfa, and lost 40 yuan in banknotes, 5 yuan in silver, 10 dimes in small silver coins, and 35 copper coins from his pocket. Gu Shijia testified that he was stationed in Chouzhuang because he heard that bandits were entering Ligang along the river from the river mouth, so he set up sentries in the area. There was a gambling den in a teahouse, and the plainclothes police entered to question them. Suddenly, Lu Liben, the patrol leader of the Second Police Station of the Sixth Sub-bureau, ordered the patrol officer Deng Deyu to beat the plainclothes police. Xu Qin'an and others argued with him, so he brought them back to the squad but did not beat them. Patrol officers Ding Changqing and Liu Tongfa gave roughly the same testimony. After the questioning, they were ordered to return and await a further summons for questioning. However, Cao Zongduo, the Chief of the Sixth District, mediated in the case and ordered the plaintiffs to withdraw and settle peacefully.</p>
<p>Several Hundred Hakkas Suddenly Arrive in Huangtu. Since Cao Zongduo took office as the Chief of the District and Jin Junxu took office as the Chief of the District Regiment in the Western Countryside, the bandit atmosphere there has calmed down slightly. However, robberies still occur from time to time in the northern countryside of Wujin. Yesterday (the 24th), several hundred people who resembled Hakkas suddenly arrived in Huangtu, wandering around in the town, similar to those meeting bandits. The town chief, fearing other developments as winter defense was approaching, sent Nian Zu to the Xia Port telephone station in the evening to report to the Public Security Bureau, requesting proper precautions. County Magistrate Li had gone to the province yesterday morning, and Director Li reported it to Secretary Xu for handling.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>The Re-division of Police Districts in the Entire County. The police districts in Nantong County are re-divided according to the autonomous regions, with a total of 19 sub-bureaus. The appointed bureau chiefs are as follows: Li Laiqin in the urban area, Zhu Yiqing in Tangzha, Chen Renzhi in Pingchao, Li Hanhui in Liuqiao, Shi Deyun in Guanren, Ding Daochang in Sian, Zhang Songting in Shigang, Gao Yi in Xiting, Wu Fuqiang in Jinsha, Xiao Guogan in Jinghua, Song Boang in Yuxi, Tang Heling in Yiyi, Fan Kang in Yudong, Jiang Xuemei in Lusi, Du Yutian in Liuhaisha, Chen Duo in Baipu, Zhang Shushen in Kenmu, Chen Xingshao in Sanyu, and Tang Ruiquan in Gangbu.

<p>Implementation of Township Clearance. The Township Clearance affairs of Tongyi were suspended due to bandit suppression. They are ordered by the province to continue, and at the same time, a household census is being carried out, with Ding Ziyan appointed as the director.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Bandits Active Again on the Border of Tongru. In the area of Zhentao and Pingchao on the border of Tongru, the bandits who fled to other places some time ago have returned to their villages one after another, and are carrying out large-scale activities. The night before last, dozens of communist bandits in Xinlu, southwest of Pingchao District, opened fire with Mauser pistols to demonstrate, firing about one hundred and several dozen shots. The villagers, who had just calmed down, were plunged into panic again.</p>
<p>Sea Bandits Rampant, Burning Boats. The sea pirates in Juegang are in a state of panic because of the daily shortage of thatch, water, and oil. Today (the 20th), the pirate ships in Nankan Port actually chopped up the fishing boats of Ge Yufang and others, which were parked in the port, and used them as fuel, and went to the nearby area to fetch fresh water. Therefore, the fishermen in each place are afraid of being kidnapped and dare not go there. They are now in a state of sealing the sea.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Political Police Officer Accused of Beating the Director. Han Ziping, the director of the Zhenjiang County Prison, was beaten by officers. He went to the court to request an examination of the injuries, which were confirmed to be true. He was ordered to seek medical treatment at his own expense and await a warrant to appear in court.</p>
<p>Complaint Against the Magistrate of Yangzhou County. Wang Chuan Dao, a citizen of Yangzhou County, previously accused Magistrate Xu of the county of taking bribes to release bandits to the provincial government. Yesterday, the Department of Civil Affairs summoned Wang Chuan Dao and transferred him to the court for investigation according to law, and then summoned Xu to confront him.</p>
<p>Soliciting Donations for Construction Bonds. The County Government has scheduled a meeting on the 29th of this month to convene the gentry, wealthy people, and chairmen of various trade associations to discuss the allocation of construction bonds.</p>
<p>Confiscation of Ma Yuren's Property. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs previously received an order from the magistrate of Yancheng County to confiscate the property of bandit Ma Yuren and those who joined Ma in creating turmoil to offset the post-disaster expenses. Although the national government had issued a clear order to arrest bandit Ma, there was no indication of confiscating his property. The post-disaster affairs in the disaster-stricken areas of Yanfu require urgent funds. It is proposed to first confiscate all the property to offset the expenses before Ma is arrested. A special report was submitted to the provincial government for instructions. The provincial government instructed to do so. However, the part of those who joined the bandits must be handled separately. The county has been ordered to comply yesterday, and also ordered to report the handling situation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Escorting and Ordering the Disbanding of Officers Out of the Country. The Enforcing Law Team of the Headquarters of the 94th Brigade stationed in Yangzhou checked the hotels last night and found four armed men, Ma Ganquan and others, in Rooms 20 and 21 of the Dalu Hotel on Xin Sheng Street, claiming to be officers of a certain disbanded division who were returning home through this port. The team checked Ma and others and found no other illegal activities, so they ordered them to remove their weapons, settle the room fees, and escorted them out of the country.</p>
<p>The Pacification Commissioner's Office Arrests Suspects. The Pacification Supervisory Office received a secret report that a guest named Gu Wenhua was staying at the Yingzhou Hotel on Gengzi Street in this city, suspected of a certain crime. The Military Law Office of the Office sent a team to check, but they did not find him. Later, they learned that Gu was hiding in the home of Chen Yuming at No. 33 Dicang Lane. The team went there with the police officers of the Public Security Bureau at 10:00 PM last night (the 23rd) and arrested Gu Wenhua and Chen Yuming together, and found a set of smoking paraphernalia. It was heard that the Military Law Office considered opium smoking a judicial matter and sent Gu Wenhua to the court, and Chen Yuming was handed over to the Public Security Bureau to be guarded and investigated.</p>
<p>Request to Build the Embankment According to the Old Route. Xu Shaotang and others, who manage the fields of the Nursery in this county, reported that Zhang Fangyun, a technician from the Construction Bureau, was measuring the Yangyi Road with rural officials and villagers and planting wooden stakes in the fields owned by the Nursery in Yujia Camp for the route. It was found that the last measurement was a straight line from east to west on the north side of the field, but now the stakes are being planted in a bow shape in the low fields for no reason. The Nursery specially submitted a request to the county government yesterday, asking the Construction Bureau to build the embankment according to the old route to avoid damage to the Nursery's fields.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>The Provincial Commission Supervises the Compilation of the Defense Corps. The Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs believes that the Baojia movement is extremely important during the period of political tutelage, and bandit alarms are frequently heard as winter approaches. Hu Gui, a special commissioner of the Provincial Garrison Area Defense Corps, was sent to Yangzhou to supervise the compilation. Mr. Hu was sent from Zheng to Yangzhou on the evening of the 22nd. On the morning of the 23rd, he went to the county government to discuss everything with County Magistrate Xu, and went to the County Party Department to meet with the Wang Tang committee members to discuss the promotion. It is heard that their implementation plan is to establish at least one team in each district first, and they will go to each district with the county magistrate in the coming days to convene township heads and order the supervision of the compilation. Mr. Hu will stay here for a week. Once the supervision of the compilation is completed, he will go to Jiangdu to handle it.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Planning the Establishment of a Provincial Livestock Farm. The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mining, in view of the many uses of cattle, is now planning to start setting up a provincial livestock improvement farm and cattle breeding department. The estimated cost of the project was previously estimated to be 76,500 yuan for start-up expenses and 56,200 yuan for recurring expenses, which are planned to be provided by the provincial funds.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Reduces Expenses, Implements Staff Reductions. The Ningbo Municipal Government has been ordered by the province to earnestly reduce expenses. Because the administrative expenses have been reduced, the government has no choice but to implement staff reductions. Therefore, starting yesterday, two staff members from the Health Section, one administrative staff member, two assistant secretaries from the Secretariat, and one clerk were dismissed to save expenses.</p>
<p>The Water Patrol Team Seizes Another Large Group of Pirates. The patrol ships and patrol teams under the Zhenhai Water Police Bureau have repeatedly captured pirates in recent days. The Fifth Water Patrol Team of the Bureau captured seven pirates, Weng Simei, Jiang Xiaomei, Huang Xiaoyu, Lin Zengbao, Bi Laowu, Luo Mei, and Weng Huatian, and rescued one refugee, Jin Jinbang, and seized 13 rifles and 205 bullets on the sea off Huanghua, Wenzhou. The Sixth and Seventh Water Patrol Teams captured six pirates, Liu Xuesheng, Wang Yizheng, Pan Wenchou, Zhu Rongsheng, Wu Rongfa, and Wang Xiangan, in the sea off Jinqing Port, Haimen. The pirates captured by the three teams were escorted to Zhenhai by the Nanhai ship and handed over to the Water Police Bureau for verification and handling yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Young Master of the Stone Factory Kidnapped. Xu Hong, a resident of Kong of Lujiabu Lishan, Cixi, who opened the Hongsheng Stone Factory, was suddenly kidnapped by six or seven bandits the day before yesterday evening, demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan. The meeting point was set at the Jiusong Pavilion in Nanhuang. Xu only has this one son and is extremely saddened after being kidnapped. He is now trying to find a way to redeem him.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>The Defense of Hefei Amidst the Rampant Communist Bandits in Luan. The headquarters of the 46th Division and the county government here received a telegram from Luan stating that a large number of communist bandits are rampant in the western countryside of the county. The regiments of the 46th Division stationed in Luan and those heading from Fei are advancing to suppress them on the 19th. However, because He Lu is close, Chairman Chen has transferred the 1st Guard Brigade of Shi Zhongcheng, stationed in Qianshan, to Fei on the night of the 16th to assist in the defense. He also ordered Wang stationed in Wu the 171st Brigade of the 57th Division to open to Fei. The County Government of Fei publicly announced this news on the 20th to reassure the people, and ordered the chiefs of each regiment in Kunlian and Liu Jing in the Western Countryside to contact each other and block them as opportunity serves.</p>
<p>The Radio Station Begins to Broadcast. The Construction Department sent technician Xia Cangyi to Fei to install a radio station in the Houjin of Changhan Village on Xiaodongmen Avenue, considering Hefei an important town in central Anhui. The installation was completed on the 18th, and broadcasting began on the 19th to Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Nanchang, Bengbu, and other places. Technician Xia has already returned to the province to report.</p>
<p>Special Report on Education News</p>
<h3>Research Report of the Children's Life Guidance Group of the Jiangsu Provincial United Elementary School (1)</h3>
<p>Report by Hu Shuyi, Nanjing Women's Middle School Experimental Elementary School</p>
<p>I. A Small Introduction</p>
<p>Entrusted with the mission of the previous conference to make a comprehensive report on the acquisition of research on children's life guidance,</p>
<p>Due to limited time, this adult's problem of children's life guidance can only be given a small and simple report.</p>
<p>We respectfully dedicate the acquisition of research on children's life guidance to the research and reference of all instructors with the utmost enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are no major discoveries in this report that can be contributed, nor are there profound theories that can be deeply explored. There are only the research acquisition facts of the process, regardless of right and wrong, truthfully written below for the deep study and review of all instructors. At the same time, we sincerely look forward to some rigorous criticisms from teachers who like to study children's life guidance.</p>
<p>II. A Historical Observation of Children's Autonomy</p>
<p>Education in the era before children were discovered can be simply summarized in one sentence: Children receiving education was akin to sitting in prison. From the education that maintained royal families, nobles, monks, and the privileges of the upper class, to the Spartan education that preserved national prosperity, and even to the education of individualism with religious colors, all are examples of disregarding children's education. These are undeniable historical traces.</p>
<p>It was 校 (JEAUJACUESROUSSEAU), a person drunk with the beauty of nature and active in the love of human life, who introduced children to the field of education. It was not until the beginning of this century, with Ellen Key (ELLENKTY) of Northern Europe and her child-centered education, that children were discovered. Rousseau wrote "Emile," advocating nature and strongly criticizing the fallacies of previous education. Our dear children were then noticed by educators. Key wrote "The Century of the Child," deeply lamenting the decline of family education and loudly advocating for the reform of school education. Only then did a ripple of child-centeredness appear in the educational thought trends.</p>
<p>However, the facts tell us that from the end of the eighteenth century to the beginning of the twentieth century, although a trend of children's education and a ripple of child-centeredness were discovered in our field, the general children were still the same as before. Except for some slight reforms in schools, everything else remained the same as before, or perhaps it could be said, almost the same.</p>
<p>In the midst of the high-pitched call for the century of the child, in the past decade, the education circles in China have mostly been managing children's autonomy to adapt to the approaching call of the century of the child, the educational trend of child-centeredness.</p>
<p>Here, we want to make a general review and strict criticism of the current general children's autonomy.</p>
<p>The lifeless Chinese education circles do not need blindly flattering criticism. We really want to expose the diseases of children's autonomy in principle, organization, and implementation, which may serve as a wake-up call for those who have gone astray.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, exposing the morbid state is also a tool for research.</p>
<p>1.  Morbid State in Principle</p>
<p>A.  Separation of discipline and instruction: a part of education is carved out to manage children's autonomy. The school hires a disciplinarian to be solely responsible for the cultivation of children's character, and hires several teachers to specially teach children some book knowledge. Thus, discipline and instruction go their separate ways.</p>
<p>Activity is a tool for children to acquire knowledge, and experimentation is a means to complete experience. May I ask if this activity that separates discipline and instruction can satisfy children's lives?</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education's Handover and Acceptance Situation</h3>
<p>The newly appointed political and vice ministers of the Ministry of Education took office on the 22nd. The situation has been recorded in this newspaper. The following is a brief summary of the handover of ministerial affairs by the former minister and the acceptance by the new minister, based on what the reporter has learned.</p>
<p>Huge Surplus of Funds Handed Over</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Ministry of Education two years ago, due to savings in expenditures and fewer personnel than other ministries (the total number of members is less than one hundred), there was a monthly surplus in the original budget. The ministry's premises were narrow and insufficient for use, so the surplus funds were used to purchase land and build two buildings, one for the offices of the various departments and one for the auditorium and library. Both buildings were strongly built and well-equipped, with running water and water heaters. The installation was completed only on the 20th of this month. On the day the new minister arrived, the rooms were brand new. The construction cost a total of more than 100,000 yuan. Although the funds had been requested from the Executive Yuan as temporary expenses, they had not been received due to the insufficient national treasury. Therefore, the daily surplus funds were used for construction needs. When the handover was made, excluding the construction costs that had already been paid, the accumulated surplus funds due to the non-payment of funds by the Ministry of Finance were very large. It has now been handed over to the new minister for acceptance.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Chiang Reporting the Acceptance Situation</p>
<p>All existing members of the Ministry of Education, except for the minister, vice minister, secretary director Zheng Tianting, and head of the document section Zhang Ying, have been handed over to the new minister. After the new two vice ministers arrived at the ministry, in addition to inviting Councilor Zhao Naiquan to concurrently serve as secretary and secretary director, and newly appointing the heads of the first, second, third, and fourth sections of the General Affairs Department and two secretaries (the list has been recorded in the previous newspaper), yesterday, He Jinghuang was announced as a member of the Secretariat, Li Xiaolou as a member of the General Education Department, Wang Xuesu, Jing Tong, Zhang Chongzhi, and Zan Wen as members of the General Affairs Department. As for the acceptance of ministerial affairs, Zhao Naichuan and others were appointed as acceptance officers. After Zhao and others were dispatched, they held a meeting that day to discuss the acceptance methods. The result was that each department and office first prepared a handover list, and then the acceptance officers checked the list. In reality, since the existing members of the ministry had not changed much, the so-called handover and acceptance was only a formal procedure that could not be avoided. Yesterday (24th), in addition to submitting a report to the Executive Yuan on the date of the oath of office, the new two vice ministers also telegraphed Chairman Jiang to report the situation, and stated that they had followed the instructions of Your Excellency and retained all the officials of the various departments and offices except for slight changes in the General Affairs Department and the Secretariat, and that ministerial affairs were proceeding as usual.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Promotes Phonetic Symbols</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Ministry of Education issued a circular to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities, attaching a small booklet on the practice of phonetic symbols, ordering them to instruct their subordinates to actually promote phonetic symbols and widely publicize them. At the same time, it also requested the Ministry of Interior to instruct the Capital Police Department to add phonetic symbols to the nameplates of streets and alleys in the capital.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Shandong Province to Plan Vocational Education for the Whole Province</h3>
<p>Vocational Schools That Have Been Suspended Should Be Restored Quickly</p>
<p>Those That Are Already in Operation Should Be Expanded Vigorously</p>
<p>The Shandong Education Department submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Education to reorganize provincial schools. Regarding the suspension of vocational schools, the Ministry of Education, after receiving the report, yesterday issued an instruction to the department to make a comprehensive plan for vocational schools, to quickly restore those that have been suspended, and to vigorously expand those that are currently in operation, or to establish vocational subjects in various middle schools to make up for the deficiencies. The original order stated:</p>
<p>The report and the list of circumstances have been fully understood. The department's intention to investigate the management of various schools and plan for improvement is very good. The methods listed in items 2 to 7 of the list are also very feasible. However, item 1 proposes to suspend all three existing provincial second, fourth, and fifth vocational schools. It is true that the equipment of each school is simple and the results are too poor. However, vocational education is related to the lives of young people and the livelihoods of vocational citizens, and is extremely important. At present, most middle and primary school graduates want to go to higher education, but they suffer from a lack of financial resources. They want to be independent, but they suffer from a lack of specialized skills. They are in a dilemma and do not know where to go. The weak become decadent and sink, while the strong tend to go astray. The society is chaotic and has no end. All of this is due to the great underdevelopment of vocational education. The local authorities handle vocational education, limited by economic and human resources, and often the spirit is completely different. It is necessary to raise funds widely, recruit talents, earnestly supervise, and promote at any time. Those with excessively poor results and unable to be reorganized should be suspended and reorganized to actively proceed. If, after the suspension, the students are dismissed and completely canceled, it is inevitable that one will choke while eating. How can we abandon the malpractices and promote education? The plan to improve secondary education decided at the second National Education Conference this year stipulates the ratio of the number of ordinary high schools to agricultural and industrial high schools in items 1 and 2 of section C of the method for setting up middle schools, which shows the urgent need for vocational education. The department must make a comprehensive plan for vocational education based on the situation in the province, quickly restore those that have been suspended, and vigorously expand those that are currently in operation, or establish vocational subjects in various middle schools to make up for the deficiencies. Please follow the instructions and report the matter with a list. This order.</p>
<h3>Sun Yat-sen University Students Actively Reject Jin and Welcome Dai</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>The entire student body of National Sun Yat-sen University sent a telegram to the Central Government regarding the movement to reject Jin and welcome Dai, which read: "To the Nanjing Branch of the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Education, and Director Dai: The three telegrams from Xiang Yuge should have been received. The school has been on strike for more than ten days, with great sacrifices. Jin has not shown any remorse for his immoral behavior, and is trying to undermine the unity of the students and preparing to take the stage by force. The dignity of teachers has been completely swept away. How can the sacred education be humiliated like this? Everyone with blood and energy is deeply saddened. Recently, we read Director Dai's telegram and felt deeply touched by his painstaking efforts. However, we believe that the director lacks the ability to know people when he says that Jin is a senior member of our party and asks the staff and students to obey his guidance. It must be known that the day Jin's moral character went bankrupt was the day Guangzhou University was established. In terms of scholarship, he is ignorant and unworthy. In terms of progress, he joined the party not long ago. Appointing him to be the president of Sun Yat-sen University is truly destroying university culture and tarnishing the school of the founding father. Recently, the heads of departments have resigned one after another and retired to preserve their integrity. This is a natural trend. Our entire student body has deeply reflected on the pain and decided to go on strike. How can we not do it? Jin has lost his conscience and is crazy, thinking that he has the backing of the military and can bully us unarmed students. If a bloody tragedy occurs, how will our government handle the aftermath? The crisis is lurking and may break out at any moment. We hereby present our words and beg for a clear understanding. Respectfully, the National Sun Yat-sen University Rejection of Jin and Welcome of Dai Movement Committee."</p>

<h3>Labor University Community College Opposes Zhang Yuanzhang as Dean</h3>

Now, President Wang Jingqi has arrived at the school to take charge. In addition to being busy with the travel arrangements for the students of each class, he has also appointed Zhang Yuanruo as the dean of the Community College. Ninety-three students from the Economics Department of the fourth year immediately held a meeting to discuss their opinions on the new dean. They unanimously opposed Zhang Yuanruo as the dean on the grounds that Zhang's knowledge, qualifications, and work experience were all unsuitable.</p>

<h3>Lehua Eliminated from the Senior Cup Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lost to Howarth by 2 to 8</p>
<p>All Resistance Lost, Allowing the Enemy to Run Rampant</p>
<p>Zhou, Li, and Chen Fought Hard</p>
<p>Yesterday was Christmas Eve. At 3:00 PM, the Lehua long ball team played Howarth in the second week of the Senior Cup at Yijin Garden Football Field. As a result, Lehua lost. The British army Howarth won by a large score of 8 to 2 and eliminated them. The three legs that barely supported the defeat were not as good as the Lehua of today. In the bitter rain and cold wind, they tried their best to support it. Cao Guicheng was also unable to attend, and it was not easy for those who did not abandon the game and played. How could they be defeated? In the whole game yesterday, almost all of the control was in the hands of the British army, and they could do whatever they wanted. The reason why the whole army was not defeated was that Zhou Jiayan, Li Ning, and Chen Yutian tried their best to support it. Their lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Xianyan, Li Ning, Guan Xun'an, Wang Shulin, Hu Jiwu, Liang Guisheng, Yang Renwei, Xi Qiaosheng, Zhou Shaowen, Chen Yutian, Li Lin</p>
<p>Strength Overwhelms Weakness as if Entering an Uninhabited Land</p>
<p>With the mighty Howarth, against the exhausted Lehua, the knife can be used effortlessly. The entire line of five forwards is not short or tall, and the advance and retreat are unified. The difference between them and Lehua is like heaven and earth. They are not weak, but the goalkeeper is slightly worse. In the 90 minutes of the game, Howarth moved freely, sweeping across the north and south, as if entering an uninhabited land. Their lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Mars, Kai Gen, Biquin, Strobin Sun, Martin</p>
<p>Miller, Weitema, Lihm, Feidan, Johnson</p>
<p>Chen Yutian Exploded out of Nowhere</p>
<p>Lehua kicked off and was obtained by the enemy. From the middle to the right, Zhou Xianyan waited patiently, and then counterattacked, but was unable to advance due to offside. Lehua made a concerted effort, and the momentum was still good. At six or seven minutes, Chen Yutian flew fast and rushed into the right side quickly. About ten yards from the goal, he raised his foot and attacked from a distance. Goalkeeper Mars was unable to jump up and the enemy's goal was broken. The audience cheered. Based on this situation, it is unbelievable that Lehua would have such a miserable defeat.</p>
<p>Penalty Kicks Were Repeatedly Awarded to the Enemy</p>
<p>Just when it was thought that Lehua might have a glimmer of hope today, the enemy's center Lihm Fei knocked on the door alone after 25 minutes of the game. The defense was unsuccessful and it became a tie. Since then, the British army's momentum suddenly became stronger, and they moved freely from left to right, doing whatever they wanted. The ball came from Kai Gen and the left winger Miller, and then to the center Henm Fei three times. Zhou Xianyan was helpless, and Lehua lost by 1 to 2. Li Ning was blocking the enemy when the referee ruled that he had fouled and awarded a penalty kick. Right Guard Biquin rushed over and kicked it in. With the loss of vitality, Lehua was beyond help. The British army's right winger Johnson flew in from the right and kicked a ball diagonally from 30 yards away from the goal, hitting the corner of the net. Lehua lost by 1 to 4 in the first half.</p>
<p>Zhou Yanxian Became the Target of Public Criticism</p>
<p>Changing sides and fighting again, Lehua was still in decline and unable to recover. With one move, the ball was immediately in the hands of the enemy. One person fought against three or four people, and the threat was immediately at the door. There was always the risk of losing the goal. The ball was only a few inches away from the goal, and it was not uncommon. Surrounded by attacks on the goal, Zhou Xianyan became the target of public criticism. Defending against a barrage of artillery fire, it was not a matter for a veteran of the iron gate. The falling flowers and flowing water were unbearable to look back on. Dan's attack made it 5 to 1, and Weitema connected with Miller's corner kick to make it 6 to 1. Dan scored again to make it 7 to 1. The continuous loss of goals cannot be recorded.</p>
<p>Chen Yutian Desperately Broke Through the Enemy's Goal</p>
<p>After suffering a crushing defeat, the audience dispersed one after another. Only more than ten minutes were left until the end of the game. Wang Shusen was injured and left the field. The remnants of the army fought hard and launched a desperate battle. They had the heart to attack the goal, but the ball did not go in. Suddenly, Chen Yutian went from the right again, 30 yards away from the goal, and flew diagonally from the right towards the goal. The enemy's goal was broken again, and they were able to regain another goal. The contribution of Chen, who had not completely overturned the entire army, was great. Afterwards, Weitema scored another goal for the enemy, making it 8 to 2 and ending the game.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising Assembly</h3>
<p>Numerous Representatives from All Circles Attended</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special City Party Department Executive Committee of the City Party Department convened representatives from all circles at 9:00 AM yesterday in the Party Department's third floor to hold a commemoration assembly for the 15th anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. Over one hundred groups attended, with a total of over seven hundred representatives. Various townships and districts also held commemoration ceremonies separately. Details of each are recorded below.</p>
<p>Assembly Staff: Chairman Yang Qingyuan, Recorder Zhou Hanmei, Master of Ceremonies Xu Yefu, Reception Zhang Hanyun, Chen Ming, Jiang Zhenwu, Yuan Qingping.</p>
<p>Attending Representatives: Mao Yun from the China Law Society, He Yuanming from the Shanghai Law College Alumni Association, Lu Dafu and Yu Mingzhang from the Shanghai Shipbuilding Industry Union, Han Zongyi and Yang Sili from the Postal Administration, Tang Junsheng from the China Business Electrical Workers' Union, Yang Zheng from the City Social Bureau, Xu Menglin from the Business Union, and representatives from over one hundred other groups, totaling over seven hundred people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Respected representatives, esteemed comrades, today is the 15th anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. It was because Yuan Shikai declared himself emperor, abolishing the Republic of China, that our Party comrades launched the Yunnan Uprising on December 25th of the fourth year of the Republic of China. Yuan was the most ambitious of the warlords of the past, holding the greatest military power during the Qing Dynasty. While still a subject of the Qing court, he already harbored the ambition to usurp the throne. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, he seized the opportunity to usurp the Republic of China. He violated the Premier's principles by assuming office in Beijing, then proceeded to suppress revolutionary forces and oppress revolutionary comrades, presumptuously declaring himself emperor. Yuan's imperial ambitions were fueled by his own insatiable desires, and abetted by the sycophantic flattery of individuals like Yang Du. At that time, although democratic politics were surging worldwide, the Chinese people's understanding was immature and they lacked political awareness. Therefore, when Yuan declared himself emperor, the masses were largely ignorant and confused. Simultaneously, imperialists, taking advantage of the ongoing European War, sought to dominate China. Yuan, in this confluence of circumstances, actually realized his imperial dream. At the time, the Premier knew that Yuan could not be loyal to the Republic of China, so while out of office, he contacted revolutionary comrades, secretly uniting them and planning the overthrow of Yuan. Thus, thirteen days after Yuan's imperial proclamation, Yunnan issued its final ultimatum to Yuan on December 23rd, demanding the restoration of the Republic of China and the execution of Yang Du and others. Yuan, of course, did not issue an order accepting this proposal, and Yunnan declared independence, formally launching the campaign against Yuan. Yuan, initially deceived by those around him, realized he had made a terrible mistake and died in remorse and anger. Therefore, summing up the facts of the Yunnan Uprising, it can be said to be a struggle between feudal forces and democratic forces. As a result of the struggle, democratic forces ultimately prevailed. Now, the Republic of China has been unified, and the Party's power has extended throughout the country. Feudal warlords like Yan and Feng have also been eliminated. However, feudal forces in various regions remain exceptionally rampant. Corruption among officials and the tyranny of local bullies are frequently heard of. It must be understood that feudal forces are built upon land capital. Unless the land problem is thoroughly resolved, it will be difficult to eradicate feudal forces. The Fourth Plenary Session resolved to first eliminate the communist bandits. This is certainly a very important task, because after the bandits are eliminated, the people can live and work in peace. But, according to the facts, even if the bandits are eliminated, many people will still have no place to live in peace and no work to enjoy, because fundamentally, many farmers have no land to cultivate. Therefore, in the future, it is hoped that the central government will pay attention to this and thoroughly resolve the land problem, realizing the Premier's legacy of "land to the tiller." Then, the livelihood problems of the farmers, who account for over 80% of China's population, can be solved, and the Chinese revolution can be completed without going astray, because feudal forces are built on land capital. Then, after the land problem is resolved, economic equality can be achieved, and political equality can be completed. The Fourth Plenary Session paid full attention to the development of industry. However, to achieve the goal of developing industry, attention should be paid to the purchasing power of the people. Assuming that the people's purchasing power is strong, the development of industry will not be a major problem. If the people's livelihood is difficult, no matter how much we advocate domestic goods and develop industry, the result will still be empty talk. Therefore, whether or not the land problem is resolved is not only the key to whether feudal forces are eradicated, but also the key to the development of industry. The second point is to overthrow imperialism. This issue is almost a commonplace by now. But in reality, the distance between the Chinese revolution and the overthrow of imperialism is still very distant. At the same time, as long as imperialism exists, the Chinese revolution cannot be completed. Among the international imperialists, the one that invades China most urgently and severely is the Japanese imperialists. Forty-five percent of their country's products are sold to China. Therefore, Japanese imperialists least want the Chinese revolution to succeed, to have a peaceful, unified, and strong central government. Therefore, we should recognize that Japan is the greatest enemy of the Chinese revolution. To complete the Chinese revolution, to make China's international status equal, economic status equal, and political status equal, we must first overthrow Japanese imperialism. The first step in overthrowing Japanese imperialism is to boycott Japanese goods. If the Chinese people fully adopt domestic goods and boycott foreign goods, its effectiveness can strike a fatal blow to Japanese imperialism. Other European and American countries, their ambitions to seize the Chinese market, have intensified their attacks due to their own economic panic. Therefore, to overthrow international imperialists, we should boycott foreign goods, resolutely and persistently adopt economic severance measures. Today is the commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising. When we think back to the difficulty of creating the Republic of China and the multitude of enemies of the Republic of China, now that the country is unified, we cannot help but learn from the past and be careful in the future. I offer these two points to encourage the representatives present, hoping that everyone will earnestly do it. Finished.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: First, Chen Kecheng gave a speech, roughly saying: On this commemoration day of the Yunnan Uprising, listening to the chairman's report, I cannot help but have some thoughts to share with the representatives present. Eradicating feudal forces is indeed a serious problem for our country's revolution today. The purpose of the Local Autonomy Training Institute established by the municipal government is to ensure that future municipal administration is not usurped by corrupt local bullies, but is driven by the efforts of revolutionary comrades. But eradicating feudal forces is by no means something that can be accomplished solely through local autonomy. Other efforts still depend on the struggle of our Party comrades and the general revolutionary masses. Then, Yang Sili, Jin Xihan, Liang Wenfa, etc., gave speeches in succession. The length of the speeches is omitted.</p>
<p>Various County Organs: The joint commemoration of the Yunnan Uprising by various organs of Shanghai County was held yesterday at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the county government. All personnel from various organs attended. Jiang Yanqiu, the propaganda minister of the County Consolidation Committee, presided over the meeting, led the attendees in saluting, and reported on the course of the Yunnan Uprising and its significance. Then, County Magistrate Yan Shenyu and others gave speeches in succession. Finally, slogans were shouted and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Navy Special Party Department: Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. The Navy Special City Party Department, together with the Shanghai-based Navy, held a commemoration assembly at 10:00 AM in the department's auditorium. Dozens of people attended. Ren Guangyu presided over the meeting, and Cai Linbing reported on the history of the Yunnan Uprising and the significance of our commemoration. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>Five Days of Holiday for Officials and Civilians for the Solar New Year</h3>

<p>Citizen Training Association: Received a telegram from the Central Executive Committee. The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Kuomintang's Citizen Training Committee, regarding the matter of five days of vacation for the solar New Year and no business closure for the lunar New Year, notifies all people's organizations in the city, stating, "The Central Executive Committee's telegram states: (In order to promote the solar calendar, the solar New Year should be changed to five days of business closure, from December 31st to January 4th. For the lunar New Year, all sectors must not close their businesses. In addition to sending a letter to the National Government for thorough guidance, a special telegram is sent for compliance.)" Received this, therefore, urgently notify all people's organizations in the city to comply. This is a notification.</p>
<p>County Government: Received a telegram from the Jiangsu People's Department. The Shanghai County Government received a telegram from the Jiangsu People's Department yesterday, stipulating the solar New Year holiday, roughly stating, "Also forward to the Nanhui County Government for review. Received a telegram from the Executive Yuan stating that the holiday dates for the solar New Year have now been determined by the central government and changed to five days, from December 31st to January 4th. All sectors must not close their businesses for the lunar New Year, in order to promote the solar calendar and change people's habits." Therefore, it is urgently telegraphed and ordered to be observed in its entirety, Province Government 回.</p>
<h3>Gu Yingfen Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>No Definite News on Huang Shaoxiong's Arrival in Nanjing</p>
<p>Guangdong Province Proceeding with the Opening of Huangpu Port</p>
<p>Gu Yingfen, Director of the National Government's Civil Affairs Department, had previously suffered from a back tumor and returned to Guangdong for recuperation. He has recently recovered. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram urging him to return to Nanjing. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, Mr. Gu, along with Chen Ce, the Administrative Yuan's Political Deputy, and six or seven secretaries, arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong aboard the President Grant. Liu Jiwen, the Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, and Zhou Yongneng, the former Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, specially prepared a customs launch to welcome them. At around 9:00 AM, the customs launch docked at the new customs pier. After Mr. Gu and others disembarked, they took a car to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office on Xinza Road to rest. At 12:00 PM, Mr. Gu, along with Liu Jiwen, Yang Hu, and others, went to the Orthopedic Hospital to visit Xiong Shihui. Mr. Gu took the overnight train to Nanjing at 11:00 PM last night. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a reporter specially visited Mr. Gu. According to the interview, the removal of the back tumor in Guangdong and the rest in the Sanatorium were quite painful for nearly forty days. The matter of Guangxi is being handled by Ma Xiaojun in Wuzhou, and a peaceful resolution is expected. Huang Shaoxiong had sent a representative, Wu Tingyang, to Guangdong, claiming that Huang would come to Nanjing for a visit, but I did not meet with Huang when I passed through Hong Kong, and I do not know the details. It is now heard that Huang, Li, and others are in Vietnam. The Guangdong Provincial Government has now decided to proceed with the construction of Huangpu Port, which is being carefully planned by the Construction Department. Construction is scheduled to begin next spring, and funding will be allocated from the Boxer Indemnity. As for Zhongshan Port, the Construction Department has detailed the reasons why it cannot be opened to the Provincial Government and requested that it be forwarded to the National Government for approval. Mr. Gu also said that he had visited Zhao Shihui's injuries this afternoon. Xiong's spirits are still good, but his face is terribly thin. The doctor fears that it will damage his mind, so he is still forbidden to talk. It is said that he is expected to recover in about a month. The following is a transcript of the letter from Deng Yanhua, Director of the Guangdong Provincial Construction Department, stating the reasons why Zhongshan Port (i.e., Tangjiawan) cannot be opened.</p>
<p>Submitting a Statement Explaining the Reasons Why Tangjiawan Cannot Be Opened and Requesting the Restoration of Huangpu Port's Opening to Trade. Respectfully Requesting Forwarding to the National Government for Reference and Adoption. The matter of opening Tangjiawan Port has been approved by the National Government. We have also been actively preparing for the opening ceremony. Yanhua originally did not dare to interfere, but because of my position in charge of construction, since the news of the opening of Tangjiawan Port was reported, people in society have repeatedly questioned it, and many have expressed their concerns. Yanhua also considers this to be a century-long plan, so after consulting the Premier's "The International Development of China," and subtly consulting with technical personnel, I believe after repeated studies that Tangjiawan still does not have the possibility of opening a port. Therefore, based on my humble opinion, I briefly state the following: (1) The Premier's "The International Development of China" is an immutable model for all construction in our Party from now on. Upon review, the third plan of "The International Development of China" stipulates 31 commercial ports, namely three world-class ports, four second-class ports, nine research ports, and fifteen fishing ports, but Tangjiawan is not included. The location of each port determined by the Premier must have been carefully considered based on its nature before being determined. If Tangjiawan had the possibility and necessity of opening a port, the Premier, who grew up here, would not have ignored it. Now, abandoning the southern major port (world-class port) stipulated by the Premier, and turning to Tangjiawan, which has not been stipulated, as a major direct trade port, is tantamount to reversing the Premier's original plan in "The International Development of China." (2) As we know, four conditions are the most important for a 良港: One is deep water, two is sheltered waters, three is a large flat area, and four is a large population. If it is an important commercial port, it must also have the possibility of defending itself against enemies. That is, other transportation, food, and water are closely related to the port. However, Tangjiawan, except for the third item, is a big problem. The rest do not meet the requirements of the above conditions. According to the 士河 and 拿馬 canals, they all allow 27-foot draft 船 to come and go. The world's 船 must be at least 27 feet deep. This is clearly evident. However, upon checking the "Map of the Pearl River and Western Tributaries of Guangdong" reprinted by the Japanese Hydrographic Department, published in the first year of Taisho in Japan, and the "Kapsingwuntobccatigris" Venus Gate map published by the British Navy in 1929, the water depth of Tangjiawan is recorded. According to the nautical chart published in 1929, the water depth from A to B is no more than two fathoms (FACHOM), and the water depth from C to D is no more than two fathoms. If a ship of more than 20,000 tons cannot pass through or be berthed (ships of more than 20,000 tons require a depth of at least 27 feet; the remaining deep-water areas are either too far from the port, or blocked by sand deposits, or not suitable for berthing). Furthermore, according to the results of the survey conducted by technicians Cai Baolin, Chen Yunan, and Yang Shaonan sent by my office to Tangjiawan in June and July last year, it is roughly stated that: (1) Near the bay, in addition to sand ridges, rice fields, and the residences of villagers, the rest are high mountains and ridges. (2) The soil in this area is all composed of sand and stone, and its texture is the loosest. Therefore, sand and stone have accumulated in all places near the sea, and the water discharge is not without reason. (3) The wind direction is mostly from the east, and its force is extremely strong. The instruments used were almost blown away by the wind. However, there were no anemometers to test its speed at that time, but it was about 30 miles per hour (referring to the measurements in June and July). There is no sheltered water in the bay, and ships are prone to danger. (4) The highest tidal water accumulation line is 81.69 feet high, and the lowest tidal water accumulation line is 74.29 feet high (referring to the measurement from the assumed elevation). The sea water is quite deep in June and July. In winter, most of the bay surface dries up, and most of the seabed sand and stone can be seen. Therefore, those who pick 　 are everywhere. Even if there is a deep place, the area is also very narrow (obtained from the words of the locals). (5) Most of this bay is sandy bottom and close to the delta outlet sand beach. Therefore, the depth of the sea varies depending on the accumulation and flow of sand. Furthermore, nearby mountains often push sand and stone to the seabed, which is a major problem (see the "Map of the Pearl River and Western Tributaries of Guangdong" by the Japanese Corporation). (6) It rained for three hours on July 13, with a rainfall of up to two inches. (7) Doubt about the water supply. The coastal area of the bay is all saltwater. The villagers rely on a mountain well that is less than a foot full and wells that they have opened themselves as drinking water. Mr. Tang Shaochuan once dug an artificial artesian well last year to supply the drinking water for a village, which is only enough for use. It is still questionable whether it is sufficient for use in prosperous times. The situation shown in the figure and report is already like this. Even if it is forcibly built, it will cost a great deal of engineering, and I am deeply afraid that it will be of no avail. As for the population aspect, there are no more than tens of thousands of people near Tangjiawan. Secondly, in terms of protection, since Tangjiawan is designated as an international direct trade port, it must have a strong defense force to protect it in the event of international war, while Tangjiawan is wide open without any natural defenses, which seems inconsistent with the conditions that a modern commercial port should have. Again, in terms of inland transportation, inland transportation is greatly related to the transportation, collection, and distribution of goods. Therefore, the reason why the Premier designated Guangzhou as a major port in the south is that the existing railways and the planned Southwest Railway system center on Guangzhou (now, the provincial roads of this province also center on Guangzhou). Now, Tangjiawan is located in a remote corner, neither benefiting from the use of existing railway transportation, nor is it possible to change the Premier's original railway plan to accommodate it. In this way, seeking to become a market for the Pacific coast and South China's commercial center is probably not something that can be achieved in a short period of time. Moreover, the only target of this port is Hong Kong. If it does not have sound qualifications itself, it is impossible to talk about seizing the inherent prosperity of others, which is deeply rooted. I remember that when the Premier was alive, I learned from my service that Mr. Chen Yixi, an overseas Chinese merchant from Taishan, repeatedly presented the matter of opening Tonggubu Port, but the Premier did not 　 it because the conditions were not met. It can be seen how cautious the Premier was about opening ports and opening up new ports. Based on the above two points, it can be seen that opening Tangjiawan as a direct trade port may not be permitted by the Premier, nor may it be possible. Furthermore, the Premier promoted the opening of Huangpu Port as a commercial port during his lifetime, as a place for international direct trade. This is a very important part of the work of opening up a major port in the south. However, today, we are proceeding with the opening of Tangjiawan. Does South China need two major direct trade ports at the same time, or will it forever abandon the most likely to prosper Huangpu Port regardless? If so, how should we resolve the issues of receiving overseas Chinese equity, government credibility, and future construction? Yanhua is ignorant and unable to list them all. However, because this matter concerns a century-long plan, and because of the questions and urges of my friends and subordinates, I dare to present my humble opinion and attach a plan of the outer port of Huangpu, a nautical chart of Venus Gate, a map of the Pearl River Western Tributaries of Guangdong, and a land survey map of the vicinity of Tangjia 　, each one copy. Please examine it, and I sincerely request permission to forward it to the National Government for 　 preparation for adoption. Whether it is appropriate is still up to you. 　 Presented to Chairman Chen, Deng Yanhua, Director of the Guangdong Construction Department.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Improvement Collection and Settlement Measures</h3>
<p>Money Industry Generally Returns to the Bank of China for Inflow and Outflow</p>
<p>Implemented on January 1st of the Solar Calendar Next Year</p>
<p>The silver and money industry has always collected and settled foreign currency in cash, but there are many risks in transit. Industry leaders have repeatedly considered improvement measures to avoid risks. After a long period of consultation, the consent of the Chinese Merchant Bank Association, the Foreign Merchant Bank Association, and the Money Industry Association was finally obtained a few days ago. Now, the notice of the Money Industry Association is recorded below. I am writing to inform you that the Shanghai Bank Association's letter stated that, after the members of our association proposed to improve the silver dollar collection and settlement methods between Chinese and foreign banks, it was resolved and a letter was sent to the compradors of various foreign banks, stating that in the future, the silver dollar collection and settlement of members of our association with foreign banks will be handled in accordance with the regulations of silver collection and settlement, all remittances will be made to avoid danger and save procedures. After that, a reply was received from the Foreign Merchant Bank Association, also expressing their approval of this, which will be implemented from January 1st of the solar calendar next year. As for drawing horizontal accounts, etc., they must also be sent before 5:00 PM. If they are overdue, they will be regarded as cash settlement. Exchange of banknotes cannot be included in the scope of remittance. According to the above, in addition to notifying the members of our association to investigate and comply, the relevant situation will be sent to your association, and it is hoped that a letter will be sent to the Foreign Merchant Bank Association so that money shops can also handle it in the same way. In this way, the remittance can be unified, and the procedures can be simplified, which is expected to be approved by your association, etc. When it came to our association, it was submitted to the standing committee for public discussion on the 16th of this month. It was decided to handle it in the same way as the Chinese Merchant Bank. After our association sent a letter to the Foreign Merchant Bank Association, a reply was received stating that our association had previously received a letter from the Shanghai Bank Association, stating that in order to reduce risks and facilitate procedures, the silver dollar collection and settlement methods have been improved and will be implemented on a trial basis from January 1st. Our association is very supportive of this measure. However, if the money industry does not join, the silver dollar collection and settlement remittance will still not be unified. Yesterday, a letter was received, knowing that your colleagues are all happy to comply, and we are very happy. However, it is hoped that you will convey to your colleagues that from January 1st, all silver dollar collection and settlement will be returned to the Bank of China for inflow and outflow. However, for those shops that have not entered the park (i.e., those that pick up and beat yuan characters), please also transfer to contact them, and follow the unified method of the large banks. There are still matters that have not been completed, and they will be presented to you at any time, etc. The relevant case will be recorded and notified, etc.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Orders the Abolition of the Jiangsu Shatian Official Property Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Ends by the End of the Year</p>
<p>Handled by the Department of Taxation</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shatian Official Property Affairs Bureau has now been ordered to be abolished by the Ministry of Finance, and must be terminated by the end of this year. The Ministry has dispatched four committee members to Jiangsu to take over. In the future, the Shatian Official Property Affairs will be under the jurisdiction of the Ministry's Department of Taxation. The people of Jiang and Chang counties had jointly appealed to the provincial government, claiming that the bureau's various tax policies were harming the country and the people, and requested that the regulations be revised and reforms be sought. The provincial government approved it and transferred it to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<h3>This Year's Collection and Payment of Accounts and Dismissal Deadline</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Approves for Record</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce notified various trade associations yesterday, stating that the Chamber has been informed by the Ministry of Industry that the State Council has resolved that merchants should settle accounts at the end of the year, use the solar calendar, and collect and pay accounts as originally agreed. After that, it was decided at the joint meeting of the ninth executive committee and the fifth supervisory committee on the 17th of this month to set February 15th of the 20th year as the date for collecting and paying accounts, and February 16th to 20th as the date for the admission and departure of shop assistants. After publishing the announcement in the newspaper and submitting it to the municipal government and the social bureau for record, on the 23rd of this month, the municipal government issued instruction No. 8404, stating that the presentation has been received and approved for record. It is hoped that you will be notified, etc. The meeting was immediately notified by letter, hoping that you will investigate and comply.</p>

<p>A total of four proposals were discussed.</p>
<p>Reduced Railway Transportation Rates Approved</p>
<p>The National Match Industry Federation held its first executive committee meeting on the 21st, which has continued for five days. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives from Various Regions: The association has eighteen representatives, including Wu Xinzai from Jinan Zhenye Factory and Jinning Zhenye Factory, Zhou Zixi from Qingdao Huabei Factory, Wang Weichuan from Jiaozhou Hongtai Factory, Lu Zhaolin from Tongpu Zhonghua Factory, Qu Xingfang from Yantai Changdian Factory, Xiang Jiyang from Beiping Danhua Factory and Tianjin representatives, Zhao Huanqing from Hangzhou Guanghua Factory, Ying Lijiang from Zhenjiang Rongchang Factory, Huang Mingmin from Shanghai Yingchang Factory, Huang Zeting from Guangdong Mindian Factory, Liang Huanwen from Guangzhou Wenming Factory and Zhuguang Factory, Yu Fang from Zhou Heyu, Gao Songfu from Shanghai Dahua Factory, Xu Huisheng from Ningbo Zhengda Factory, Cai Keming from Huaming Factory, Han Dongping from Dongbei Jinhua, Zhongzhi, Guandong, and Huilin Factories, Xu Yi from Suzhou Hongsheng Factory, and Liu Hongsheng from Dachina Factory.</p>
<p>Proposals for discussion were first presented by Liu Hongsheng, the chairman of the standing committee: (1) Accounting, (2) Products of various factories, (3) Work of the past year. Followed by discussion on (1) the special tax issue, (2) the monopoly issue, (3) other tax regulations, (4) methods to reduce railway transportation rates. The first three items are still under discussion. However, regarding the fourth item, after submitting a request to the Ministry of Railways to reduce rates, a reply was received yesterday. The reply is recorded below:</p>
<p>Reply from the Ministry of Railways: The submitted document requests that the transportation of finished match products, matchbox components, and cardboard boxes from Chinese-owned factories be uniformly charged at the fourth-class rate for another year to overcome difficulties and provide relief. Approved. In order to provide relief to the match industry, it is temporarily approved to extend the reduced rate for six months from March 1st of next year. The method will be further discussed and decided upon at the National Railway Freight Rate Conference. In addition to ordering various lines to comply, this reply is hereby issued for notification. This concludes the reply.</p>
<p>The National Match Industry Federation submitted six points of consensus reached at the executive and supervisory meeting to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Executive Yuan. The original text is recorded below: (Submission regarding opinions on the new tax, earnestly requesting approval. As the Ministry of Finance is about to implement the special tax, the association held an executive committee meeting on the 21st of this month to discuss and unanimously resolved to submit opinions to the government. Hereby respectfully submitted as follows: (1) Please do not retroactively collect the special tax on products manufactured before its implementation. All manufactured matches before the implementation of the new tax, regardless of location, should not be retroactively taxed. (Reason) The cost of all manufactured matches before the implementation of the new tax is different from after the new tax. Therefore, they should be handled separately. (2) The burden of raw materials in various regions should remain equal. From January 1st, 20th year, all raw material taxes on matches must be equal across regions. If there are any additional sub-taxes, etc., they should be considered a violation of the Ministry of Finance's explicit order and should be refunded within the special tax. (Reason) Since the special tax is implemented, the burden in various regions should be equal. If there are additional sub-taxes on raw materials, it will not only fail to thoroughly eliminate tariffs, but also destroy equality. Therefore, it must be refunded within the special tax. (3) The special tax should not be an additional or duplicate collection. (1) After the implementation of the new tax, if any taxes, fees, or miscellaneous expenses arise, regardless of their nature, whether central or local, they should be refunded within the special tax. (2) The special tax must be mutually recognized between regions and should not be re-levied due to provincial differences. If such a situation occurs, it should be refunded within the special tax paid in the original region. (3) Special taxes should not be levied on wood, paper, and other match raw materials used for raw materials and materials for collecting special taxes. (Reason) Since the tax has been reformed, efforts should be made to ensure thoroughness, and there should be no duplication of various items. Point 1 is a duplication of taxes on one item, point 2 is a duplication of special taxes in various regions, and point 3 is a duplication of special taxes on raw materials and finished products. (4) The special tax should use the following grading as the standard: 1. Small safety matches with 75 sticks or less (excluding an average of 75 sticks, double-headed broken sticks), or sulfurized phosphorus matches with 100 sticks or less (excluding an average of 100 sticks, double-headed broken sticks), should be classified as lower grade. 2. Medium-box long-stick safety matches with 100 sticks or less (excluding an average of 100 sticks, double-headed broken sticks), should be classified as middle grade. 3. Large-box matches with 125 sticks or less and foreign matches (regardless of the number of sticks and length, as long as it is 125 sticks or less), should be classified as upper grade. 4. For those with an even greater number of sticks, the tax rate should be calculated accordingly. (Reason) Since the types and costs of finished matches are different, special taxes should be levied separately to ensure fairness. (5) Please do not collect any other fees. After the implementation of the new tax, the saltpeter and sulfur transport documents should be immediately abolished. (Reason: Requiring both passports and transport documents for transporting potassium nitrate and sulfur is redundant. After the implementation of the new tax, there is no reason to keep these transport documents and fees. They should be abolished. (6) When implementing the new tax, it is necessary to prevent foreigners from establishing factories in the interior to engage in aggression. 1. Chinese factories (excluding those that do not pay raw material taxes to the Chinese government) should have a portion of the special tax refunded in the name of a reward to differentiate them from foreign-funded factories. 2. The number of factories should be limited to those currently registered with the central government (registration with local government offices is invalid). The reorganization or expansion of old factories should be subject to considerable inspection. If there is foreign investment, the government should prevent it. (Reason) Foreigners have an aggressive intent towards the match industry. Although the new tax simultaneously raises the import tax on foreign matches to 40%, this is not enough to suppress the import of foreign goods. As for factories established by foreigners within China, they pay taxes in the same way as Chinese factories, without any distinction. In the future, foreign merchants will not import from abroad, but will establish factories in China. The disaster may be hundreds or thousands of times greater than today. This reward and the method of restricting the establishment of factories are to prevent foreign aggression. In addition, the match industry in the Northeast has already implemented resistance to foreign merchants' aggression. The special tax system is that every 2,400 boxes, Chinese and foreign, are affixed with a one-yuan-and-fifty-cent stamp tax, but in reality, Chinese factories only pay thirty cents. The Guangdong Province's regulations on the collection of inland consumption tax on matches also have provisions for refunding raw material taxes and other miscellaneous fees. This request is to adopt the precedents of the Northeast and Guangdong. Furthermore, the government has special industrial incentive laws. Now, it is justified to refund a portion of the tax under this name. Moreover, the output of existing Chinese-owned factories already exceeds demand. It is necessary to prevent foreign investment and limit Chinese factories. The sixth item, the incentive and the method of restricting the establishment of factories, is particularly important. If the first to fifth items are affected, the result will be the incomplete elimination of tariffs and the increased burden on merchants. If the two methods in the sixth item cannot be implemented, foreign merchants' aggression will intensify, affecting the future of the entire Chinese match industry. The government's goal of eliminating tariffs and reforming taxes is to relieve the suffering of merchants and rescue industry. It can take overall consideration and make the best judgments. However, as matters concern personal interests, the association's executive committee has resolved to submit opinions, earnestly requesting review, approval, and adoption, for which we will be extremely grateful. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Legislative Yuan by the National Match Industry Federation).</p>
<h3>Wine Industry Resumes Work Today</h3>
<p>Subsidy Issue for Agencies Finally Resolved Yesterday</p>
<p>The strike in the city's wine industry could have been resolved and work resumed yesterday, but due to the issue of subsidies for agencies' strike losses, normal work could not resume. The situation yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>Workers' Congress: At 9:00 AM yesterday, the workers' union convened an emergency meeting of all agencies, chaired by Hu Gu, with formalities. First, the chairman reported on the situation of attending the Chamber of Commerce meeting last night (24th), stating that the Chamber of Commerce had resolved to provide a subsidy of five yuan per person for the agencies' strike losses and to compensate the workers' union based on one yuan per person for the number of agencies. The stamp was also ordered to be abolished by the district bureau. The strike could be considered over. He requested that everyone resume work today. After the report, the agencies felt that giving five yuan was too little and immediately expressed unwillingness to resume work. As a result, it was decided to hold another meeting in the afternoon to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting: At 2:00 PM, another emergency meeting of all agencies was convened, chaired by Gu Jiren, with formalities. First, the chairman reported that the morning's attempt to resolve the issue with insufficient compensation failed, which was unfortunate for the union. After discussion by the executive committee, a satisfactory solution was found. If the agencies insisted, it would not be a good sign. If they wanted a slight increase, the Chamber of Commerce's compensation for the union's losses could be transferred to the agencies, totaling six yuan per person. The money would be collected from each shop by the union within three days and distributed to the agencies with a stamp. As for the union's losses, further compensation would be sought from the Chamber of Commerce. Thus, a storm was calmed, and work could resume this morning.</p>
<p>Accepted Conditions: The conditions proposed by both labor and management in this strike have been accepted by the Collection Office, including: (1) Immediately abolish the stamp. This was ordered by the head of the Second District Bureau. (2) Dismiss Zhu Houfu, who incited the strike. Zhu Houfu has now resigned voluntarily. (3) Extend the license application time. This has now been extended from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, allowing license applications at any time. (4) The agency should be paid for carrying wine that has been penalized. The office has agreed to subsidize 20 cents per load and 70 cents per basket. (5) The license should be properly affixed, and it should not be forcibly torn or confiscated without reason. This has also been approved. However, the issue of fines must be given a five-part receipt. This has not yet been resolved and will be negotiated after work resumes. The conditions can be considered a victory.</p>
<h3>Sea Trials of the "Datong" Warship</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Guowen News Agency happened to participate in the sea trials of the Navy's "Datong" warship, which sailed towards Minhang yesterday. Here are the observations for the readers. The ship is 260 feet long, 27 feet wide, 11 feet deep, and has a displacement of 1,000 tons. The specified speed is 21 knots per hour. It is equipped with three large cannons, two anti-aircraft guns, two six-pounder guns, and eight machine guns. During the sea trials, the ship's body was very convenient and without vibration. The speed was as specified. Everything inside the ship was brand new and orderly. The combat equipment, telecommunications, defense supplies were all very agile and continuous.</p>
<p>It is noted that the ship was originally named "Jian'an," built at the Mawei Shipyard. Previously, it had not been repaired for a long time, and officials considered the project too large, almost rendering it useless. Later, Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan made comprehensive plans and ordered the shipyard in May of this year to focus on repairs and renovations, with a deadline of February or March of next year. When Chen concurrently took charge of the shipyard, he was diligent and led by example, greatly inspiring all employees. The ship was completed ahead of schedule, with performance no different from a new ship, but with less than one-tenth of the expenditure. With painstaking efforts and remarkable construction, it is to Chen's credit. The ship is scheduled to hold a flag-raising ceremony on January 1, 20th year, and will be incorporated into the Second Fleet.</p>
<h3>Transportation Industry Strives for Exemption from Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>Letters to various companies unanimously strive for exemption</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's Hangzhou Transportation Association sent letters to various companies along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway yesterday, stating that on December 2nd of this year, the association, due to the cargo receipt issued by the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau (referred to as the bill of lading), was previously notified by the Transportation Department on August 4th that it was exempt from stamp duty. However, in October, they suddenly received a letter from the city's Stamp Tax Bureau, forcibly ordering their fellow traders to be responsible for purchasing stamps, causing disputes among their fellow traders. A second general meeting of members was held to resolve the issue. After discussion, the members unanimously stated that they should not be responsible for purchasing stamps and vowed to argue reasonably. They presented various reasons (omitted). The reasons stated are very sufficient. All the members have unanimously resolved to prepare a document and argue reasonably. In addition to requesting the Ministry of Finance to withdraw its order and submitting it to the General and Branch Stamp Tax Bureaus, requesting the revocation of the original case of affixing stamps to this bill of lading, a special letter is sent, hoping to investigate and strive for it together.</p>
<h3>Petition to Abolish Coal Tax</h3>
<p>Respect Government's Prestige</p>
<p>Quickly Relieve Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association submitted a document to the National Government Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, requesting the abolition of coal tax to conform to the government's prestige. The coal tax began in July of the 16th year of the Republic and was an unprecedented anomaly. Coal merchants were unfortunate and bore the brunt of it. In the four years since, although it has been reduced twice, more than a hundred coal merchants have been ruined by the coal tax. The implementation of the coal tax is extremely unequal. The same coal is taxed when transported and sold by Chinese merchants, but only registered when transported and sold by foreign merchants, and can be released without obstruction. This method is very painful, and one cannot help but accuse the government of destroying Chinese merchants. The coal tax has been repeatedly petitioned by coal merchants, and the government has used encouraging words, such as the Ministry of Finance's No. 112 reply on October 12th of the 16th year, stating that the coal special tax is a type of commodity tax, which should be abolished immediately after the implementation of tariff reduction and tax increase in accordance with the order of tariff reduction and tax increase and the regulations on the abolition of domestic transit tax. During the active Northern Expedition, there was an urgent need for funds, so please be considerate of the difficult times and maintain the overall situation, and work hard to undertake it. Once the tariff reduction and tax increase are implemented, the special tax will be abolished immediately to take care of both and enrich the people's livelihood. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's telegram on September 12th of the 17th year slightly stated that the Jiangsu Finance Department reviewed and replied that from September 1st of this year, before the city tariff is implemented, the coal item will still be taxed at the current commodity tax rate of two cents per load in Jiangsu Province, totaling three cents, three cents and six li per ton. The Ministry of Finance's telegram No. 2200 on March 28th of the 18th year slightly indicated that whether the coal tax can be changed depends on whether the tariff reduction has been implemented. The tariff reduction and tax reform are currently in the planning stage, so the coal tax cannot be changed for the time being. Looking at these replies and telegrams, the government clearly indicated that the coal tax would be abolished when the tariff reduction is implemented. The documents are clear as the sun and stars. However, the Ministry of Finance forgot to abolish the coal tax in its telegrams, probably due to being busy with many affairs. In order to respect the government's credibility and quickly relieve the merchants' predicament, a petition has been prepared, and Lu Qisheng, Pan Yisan, and Wang Pingnan have been jointly recommended as representatives. It is humbly requested that the government approve the abolition of the coal tax as soon as possible. The petition is presented.</p>

<h3>New Cooperation Agreement Between Chinese and Foreign Steamships on the Shanghai-Ningbo Route</h3>
<p>Effective from New Year's Day</p>
<p>The only Chinese-foreign joint venture route, the Ningbo line, since the Taikoo, China Merchants, Sanbei, Ningshao companies joined forces last year to jointly operate fares, has broken the bad habit of indiscriminate fare reductions in the past.  The operating income has increased rather than decreased.  The four companies, whose one-year cooperation term has expired, have now continued their joint venture, but with slight revisions to the treaty.  After a week of consultations on the new treaty, the four companies have reached a decision and formally signed the agreement yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Allocation of Public Funds</p>
<p>The operations of the four companies will continue as originally planned, with 800,000 yuan divided into four shares. Ningshao takes the lead, followed by Sanbei and China Merchants, and lastly Taikoo. The new treaty only increases the control over the allocation of public funds. The original agreement, from January 1, 1931, to December 31, stipulates that the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo line shall jointly promote freight agreements. In addition to the allocated amounts, any surplus public funds shall be revised according to Article 4 as follows: The allocation of public funds shall be based on the frequency of each ship, etc., and the allocation method shall be: (1) Xin Jiangtian shall be allocated a freight rate of 10 per trip; (2) Xin Ningshao shall be allocated 11 per trip; (3) Ningyu Xing shall be allocated 10 per trip; (4) Xin Beijing shall be allocated 10 per trip. During the repair period of each ship, each company may send a ship of equal tonnage to replace it. In case of accidents, such as engine damage, requiring suspension of navigation for more than one month, the company may send another ship, but the allocation rate shall be determined separately by the four companies.</p>
<p>Revision of Discounts</p>
<p>According to the current Shanghai-Ningbo freight table, the original price is calculated at an 85% discount. It has now been decided that from March 1, 1931 of the Republic of China, this 85% discount will be cancelled, and the full original price will be charged. By that time (i.e., before March 1), the four companies will separately sign a freight agreement to implement this.</p>
<p>Addition of Armed Guards</p>
<p>Due to the unrest at sea, merchant ships in the waters off Zhejiang often suffer from pirate attacks. The ships of the four companies on the Shanghai-Ningbo line do not yet have armed guards. This issue has been raised for discussion at this meeting, and the four companies have unanimously agreed to stipulate in the new agreement that (B) each company may deploy armed guards on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, and the expenses may be moderately offset by slightly increasing passenger fares. This matter is already being discussed by the four companies for implementation.</p>
<p>Transshipment Commissions</p>
<p>The 85% discount for goods shipped from Shanghai has been cancelled. The weight discount for goods transshipped from Ningbo to Shanghai is: (1) 15% for Hong Kong and Guangdong; (2) 20% for various ports in the North. The commission is calculated at 95% for ordinary passengers. In addition, each company may designate three customs brokers to receive a special discount of 10% (calculated from the gross amount) every year on January 1 and July 1. The Ningbo passenger discount is also calculated and paid in accordance with the first and seventh months of the lunar calendar, and no advance payments are allowed. The cotton commission is deducted at 15% for cash discount and 10% for period discount, both calculated on the net amount. This new contract is divided into Chinese and English versions (each company holds one copy, effective from New Year's Day).</p>
<h3>Theft of Tobacco Leaves at China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>Stolen Tobacco Leaves All Recovered</p>
<p>South Warehouse Staff Under Custody</p>
<p>General Manager Li Makes Major Rectifications</p>
<p>Hopes for Clearing Up Long-Standing Abuses</p>
<p>The theft of tobacco leaves from warehouses is common everywhere. The abuses in this regard are most difficult to detect and eliminate. Since taking over the China Merchants Bureau, General Manager Li Zhonggong has been renovating the warehouses to establish great trust with customers and eliminate abuses among staff. Recently, a large shipment of tobacco leaves from Xuchang was transported to Shanghai and unloaded into Warehouse No. 7 in the South Warehouse, totaling more than 6,000 pieces. The value of this tobacco is very high. After being stored in the warehouse, it was discovered that several pounds were missing from each piece of tobacco leaves. General Manager Li received the information and immediately ordered a secret investigation by the Inspection Department, which unexpectedly found the stolen goods in the warehouse.</p>
<p>Original Stolen Goods Found</p>
<p>The Inspection Department of the South Warehouse assisted the staff of the Dingji tobacco company in searching Warehouse No. 7. As expected, more than 30 pieces of tobacco leaves were found in the miscellaneous grains stored in the warehouse, worth about 2,000 yuan. It is believed that the thieves were unable to transport the stolen goods out in time and had no choice but to mix them with the miscellaneous grains, intending to sell them out later when the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>Clearing and Unloading Goods</p>
<p>General Manager Li is handling this matter very seriously, as only in this way can he gain the trust of customers and eliminate long-standing abuses. He has ordered all tobacco merchants to unload and clear all 6,000 pieces of tobacco leaves to determine the amount of stolen goods. He has also ordered the Warehouse Department to inspect other goods to find out if there are any other stolen items. Therefore, Warehouse No. 7 has been very busy unloading goods in recent days, and the situation will be thoroughly clarified soon.</p>
<p>Warehouse Staff Under Custody</p>
<p>The thieves who stole the tobacco have not yet been found. Although the stolen goods have been recovered, no one has confessed to the theft. However, warehouse staff member Weng Youshan has a specific job responsibility and cannot shirk responsibility. It is still difficult to determine whether he is guilty of self-theft under his supervision. Yesterday, General Manager Li ordered the Inspection Department of the South Warehouse to place Weng under custody for further investigation after the warehouse is cleared. After this incident occurred, customers have expressed sympathy and trust for Li's serious efforts to eliminate abuses and protect merchants' goods.</p>
<h3>Two Young Girls Kidnapped in Yu Dong Port Outside Songkou</h3>
<p>Cui Changlin's Family Suffers an Unexpected Calamity</p>
<p>First Robbed, Then Two Daughters Kidnapped</p>
<p>Around 11 PM the night before last, two pirate ships with more than 20 pirates armed with guns suddenly landed at Yu Dong Port outside Wusongkou and stormed into the home of Cui Changlin to rob. Before leaving, they kidnapped Cui's eldest daughter, Qiaolin (19 years old), and second daughter, Qiaozhen (13 years old). During the journey, Qiaozhen tried to escape but was shot and wounded by the pirates, falling by the roadside. The pirates then carried Qiaolin onto the pirate ship, set sail, and fled, claiming that a ransom must be prepared within a week.</p>
<h3>Fire in Gaoqiao, Pudong Burns Two to Death</h3>
<p>Husband and Wife Intend to Become Mandarin Ducks of Shared Fate</p>
<p>Poor Firefighting Leads to Fire Spreading to Two Homes</p>
<p>Chen Qiuting, a 54-year-old farmer with the address of No. 75, Dong, San Guantang area, Gaoqiao, Pudong, and his wife, Chen Ling, 46 years old, were boiling water in the kitchen to wash their feet before going to bed the night before last. After going to sleep, the fire was not completely extinguished, causing the embers to fall on the firewood, and a raging fire quickly erupted, turning into a prairie fire. The Chens, who had been working hard during the day, were sleeping soundly at night and did not wake up. By the time the fire burned them and the smoke filled the house, there was no way out. The couple died together in the fire, becoming mandarin ducks of shared fate. The firefighting equipment in the area was poor, so the fire spread to the homes of Fan Wangsheng at No. 74 and Chen Xiaohong at No. 76. Despite strenuous efforts to put out the fire, most of the houses were burned down, but the fire did not spread to other neighbors. The bodies of Chen Qiuting and his wife were not pulled out until yesterday. Gao Linquan, the local security officer of the 17th District, reported the matter to the local court for inspection, while Chen Xiaoting, the deceased's brother, petitioned the court to waive the inspection.</p>
<h3>A Bowl of Rice Leads to Death</h3>
<p>Old Mother Speaks with Emotion</p>
<p>Son Intends to Sacrifice Himself</p>
<p>Zhou Jiyun, a native of Funing who lives in a bungalow at No. 67, Longhua Road, Gaochang Temple, makes a living by pulling a rickshaw. His son, Zhou Buqing, 22 years old this year, follows in his father's footsteps and continues his father's business. However, the family has many mouths to feed, and the daily cost of food is quite high, making life extremely difficult. At dinner the day before yesterday, Zhou Buqing had a large appetite and ate an extra bowl of rice. His mother, Yang, said to him, "There are still people who haven't eaten yet, eat less." After hearing these words, Zhou Buqing felt a great shock and silently went to bed. Yesterday, when the sun was three poles high, he had not yet gotten up. His father pushed open the door and saw that he had hanged himself on the bed and died. His body was cold and stiff. The whole family cried. The police reported the matter to the Second District Police Station, which ordered Ji Anguo, the local security officer of the 14th District, to report to the local court. The family requested a waiver of the inspection, but it was not approved. After Inspector Yang arrived to inspect the body, he ordered it to be collected for burial.</p>
<h3>Vacancy for Foreign Engineer in the Dredging Bureau Filled by a Chinese</h3>
<p>The Dredging Bureau decided after negotiations between negotiator Jin Qian and Chief Engineer Hai Qian and Tax Officer Mei that foreign engineers who leave the Dredging Bureau would not be replaced and that Chinese engineers would be used instead. Therefore, when Hart, a British supervisor at the Zhanghuabang factory of the Bureau, was distributing salaries on a mud dredging ship on the Huangpu River, he was killed by a gunshot. At the time, Director Song advocated that Chinese be used to fill the vacancy and advertised for applications. However, because the qualifications of the Chinese applicants were insufficient, a French Russian named Que Bolin (the person who was assassinated) was temporarily hired. The vacancy he left has now been temporarily filled by Zhu Hua, the deputy construction engineer sent by the Bureau. It is recently rumored that the person to succeed him as the factory supervisor of the Bureau has not yet been selected, and Director Song Ziliang still advocates that Chinese engineers should be hired in accordance with the resolution to comply with the original plan. However, this matter must await a meeting before a decision can be made.</p>
<h3>Jiangjiatang in Minhang Robbed</h3>
<p>Fifty to Sixty Robbers</p>
<p>Arrived with Torches and Weapons</p>
<p>Jiangjiatang Village, about seven or eight li from Minhang Town, Shanghai County, is a remote place where Jiang Honggen, Jiang Xiaoan, Jiang Shulou, Jiang Jialiang, Jiang Jiajing, etc., live together. Around 1 AM the night before last, fifty to sixty robbers suddenly arrived with torches and weapons and stormed into the village, breaking down doors and entering to loot at will. The entire village was robbed, and the details of the stolen goods have not yet been determined. Jiang Jialiang, one of the victims, resisted the robbers at the time, resulting in head and waist injuries. After hearing the alarm, Director Pan of the First Branch of the County Police and Commander Wu of the First District Security Corps immediately led the entire team of police and militia to rush to the scene to apprehend the robbers, but they had already gone far away. They immediately reported the situation to the County Public Security Bureau for instructions. Yesterday morning, Director Yan Jian personally traveled to Minhang by car, accompanied by Director Pan and Commander Wu, to visit the scene of the incident, investigate the situation in detail, and inquire about the robbery. He then returned to the city. Before leaving, he instructed Director Pan and others to tighten the investigation and ensure that the case is solved and the criminals are punished within days to deter bandits.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Farmhouse</h3>
<p>Entire Family Pulled Out of Sleep</p>
<p>All Were Bound to Chairs</p>
<p>Only Untied the Following Morning</p>
<p>Around 11 PM the night before last, more than ten robbers speaking with a northern accent and with painted faces suddenly arrived at the home of Wang Nianchun, a resident of Wangjiazhai, about six li northwest of Wusong, and broke open the gate and rushed in. At that time, Wang had gone to Shanghai for business and had not returned. His wife, Zou, and children were all fast asleep. They were dragged out of bed by the robbers, tied to chairs with ropes, and their mouths were tightly stuffed with cotton. The robbers then began to rob. Hearing dogs barking in the distance, the robbers were afraid of being exposed, so they took the stolen goods and fled to the west with a whoop. Wang's family saw the robbers go far away and wanted to untie the ropes and report to the neighboring village, but the ropes were tied to the back of the chairs, making it impossible to do so. Their mouths were stuffed with cotton, making it impossible to shout. It was not until dawn that a neighbor passed by their house, saw the door open, and heard no sound. Upon entering, they discovered that the Wang family had been robbed and untied Wang's wife and children from the chairs. When Wang returned home around 10 AM yesterday, he inspected the stolen clothes, jewelry, silver dollars, etc., and the losses amounted to more than 500 yuan. He has already reported the matter to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Hou Chen Sues for Severance of Mother-Son and Mother-Daughter-in-Law Relationship</h3>
<p>Dispute over Whether Adopted or Biological Son</p>
<p>Investigation of Evidence Attempted to Resolve the Matter</p>
<p>Mrs. Hou Chen, a widow residing at No. 364, Yongtai Lane, Zhaofeng Road, has a son named Guisheng, who was originally working as a runner in a roulette gambling house at No. 181, Fuxu Road. He witnessed the casino granting prizes of sixty or seventy yuan, enough to support his mother, sister, and family. However, his mother was also addicted to gambling, particularly flower games, day and night, with little success, leading to mounting debts. Lin Sheng, unable to dissuade her, took his wife, Ms. Xu, and moved out, ceasing to provide for her needs. Mrs. Hou Chen then caused disturbances at the gambling house, leading the owner to fire Guisheng. Guisheng's resentment towards his mother deepened, and he incited his wife, Ms. Xu, to gather aggressive women to provoke her. Therefore, Mrs. Hou Chen hired a lawyer to sue in the Special District Local Court, seeking permission to sever the mother-son and mother-daughter-in-law relationship with Guisheng and Ms. Xu. According to her petition, after marrying Hou Caisheng, she only had a daughter named Xinggen. Lacking a son, she adopted Guisheng and financed his education from a young age, hoping he could become independent. However, Guisheng used studying as a pretext to associate with ruffians. After Caisheng's death fifteen years ago, he became even more reckless. In March of the previous year, to marry Xu Xuliang's daughter, Chengbao, hoping for his reform, the defendants colluded and frequently started arguments, demanding money. On July 11th of this year, incited by her father, she gathered many female thugs to assault her, only to be dispersed by neighbors. Later, they invited people to her house and forcibly took away her clothes and belongings. Such disrespect and intolerance are unbearable. She specifically requests a judgment to sever the mother-son and mother-daughter-in-law relationship. After being sued, Guisheng hired lawyer Hong Shihao to file a defense, denying being the plaintiff's adopted son, claiming to be Caisheng's biological son. When Caisheng was critically ill, he cut his arm to make soup, hoping to cure his father's illness, with the remaining scar still visible. If he were not his biological father, who would do this? He started working outside at the age of sixteen, with half of his monthly salary taken by his mother. His sister and wife's needlework income was also mostly handed over to the plaintiff, so his monthly income was no less than one hundred yuan. The reason for the mounting debts is that his mother set up both a "Swallow's Nest" (a gambling den) and played flower games. Having such a mother, what could he do? Recently, his job was lost due to his mother's disturbance. He relies on his wife's work to make a living and has no extra money to support his mother. Now, she wants to break the relationship, intending to recruit another son-in-law, disrupting the bloodline and damaging property. It is difficult to remain silent and requests the rejection of her lawsuit. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi opened the court for a hearing. Both parties held their own views on whether he was an adopted or biological son. Besides oral statements, there was no written evidence. Judge Yang studied the case for a long time, stating that to conduct a trial according to law, evidence must be investigated. He instructed both parties to retreat and attempt reconciliation. If reconciliation fails, a further hearing will be scheduled.</p>

<p>Subsequent Performances Scheduled in About Twenty Days</p>
<p>Henan Province has suffered from continuous years of disaster. This time, it has been further ravaged by war. Now, with the cold weather and the year-end approaching, disaster victims are exposed and starving, with countless deaths due to cold and hunger. Zhang Fang, the former Director of Civil Affairs of the Henan Provincial Government, came to Shanghai to report on the disaster situation in Henan and to consult with Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Relief Committee, as well as Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, and others, requesting them to persuade Mei Lanfang, Wang Fengqing, Tan Fuying, Jiang Miaoxiang, Yao Yufu, and other famous Shanghai opera stars to perform for disaster relief to save the victims. On the evening of the previous day at 7 PM, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, and Li Zushen hosted a public banquet for Mei, Wang, Tan, Jiang, and Yao at the Dahua Hotel, and invited Tu Xiaolai, Yuan Ludeng, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Xie Hengchuang, Zhao Jinqing, Yu Zhihao, as well as Fan Zhengbo from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Li Zizhong, a representative from Henan, to attend. Xu Shiying first reported on the severity of the disaster in Henan and stated that Dr. Mei had agreed to perform for disaster relief. He offered a modest banquet as a toast. Then, Fan Zhengbo (from Henan) and Li Zizhong gave a detailed report on the Henan disaster, almost breaking down in tears. They also thanked Dr. Mei on behalf of the Henan disaster victims. Dr. Mei then rose to speak, saying that his visit to Shanghai was short and he might not be able to stay long. However, after listening to Chairman Xu and Fan and Li's reports, the disaster in Henan was severe, and he should do his utmost to fulfill his duty. However, the originally scheduled performance date was still more than twenty days away. He should proceed with subsequent performances after this period, which he would be very willing to do. Yuan Ludeng continued the speech, saying that Dr. Mei was a world-renowned figure. The current disaster situation in Henan was so severe. Dr. Mei's appearance on stage to help relief was known to the world, who would certainly say that the people of our country have the virtue of helping their compatriots. As for himself, he was also a member and should follow gentlemen like Shi Xiaojun, do his best to help, and would never decline. Li Zushen also gave a speech and raised a glass to Dr. Mei. Toasts were exchanged, and everyone enjoyed themselves until 10 PM, when they dispersed.</p>
<h3>New Locomotive for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to Be Tested Today</h3>

<h3>Social Bureau Cracks Down on Frauds and Swindlers</h3>
<p>Wu Dan Impersonates a Councilor from the Fifth Division to Solicit Donations</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau previously received a report from the Municipal Coal Industry Association stating that recently, someone claiming to be Wu Dan, a councilor from the Fifth Division Headquarters, claimed to have obtained the names and addresses of the leaders of various industry associations from the Municipal Social Bureau with permission from the Social Bureau to solicit donations for the Henan Province Military Disaster Relief Committee. On December 9th, he went to Wei Hongwen's Xieshenghe Coal Store in Dongjiadu, Nanshi, and forcibly donated 40 yuan, issuing a receipt. Seeing that the situation was suspicious, they recorded the name card and receipt and submitted them for verification. The Bureau stated that hooligans were using charity as a pretext to solicit donations for personal gain in the city, and had already issued a notice prohibiting this. All legitimate charitable acts must have the donation booklet submitted to the Bureau for official stamping in advance to be valid. Otherwise, it would be considered a forgery, and citizens could report to the police at any time to arrest them. The association's claims were not found in the records. Regarding whether there was a councilor Wu Dan in the Fifth Division, a letter was received from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters stating that the Fifth Division had no such person. This Wu Dan was impersonating a public official, engaging in fraud and swindling outside, which was particularly hateful. A letter had been sent to the Public Security Bureau to instruct them to strictly investigate and arrest him for prosecution.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Bureau Cables for the Swift Release of Tonghua Crew Members</h3>

<h3>A Laughing Matter Seafarer</h3>
<p>Son (Returning from a long journey. He has been a guest in a foreign land for seven or eight years. He arrives at the door. He asks a newly hired servant.) Is the Madam at home?</p>
<p>Servant (Looking the son up and down) Who are you? Did our Madam ask you to come?</p>
<p>Son Don't worry about it. I want to see her. She is waiting for me.</p>
<p>Servant Ah? She is waiting for you? (Acting surprised)</p>
<p>Son (Smiling) Yes. Even before I was born, she was waiting for me. Because she is my mother.</p>
<p>Mother (Asking her nine-year-old daughter) Child, do you miss your father?</p>
<p>Daughter Of course, I miss him. Father has been away for three years.</p>
<p>Mother Today, I'm going to write him a letter. Would you like to send him a kiss in my letter?</p>
<p>Daughter Mother, would it be okay to send it tomorrow? Because I just ate onions today.</p>
<p>Middle-aged woman (Arriving at a shop, speaking to a shop assistant.) Do you have many kinds of handkerchiefs here?</p>
<p>Shop assistant Very, very many. What kind of handkerchief does the Madam want?</p>
<p>Middle-aged woman Take out a few more for me to look at.</p>
<p>Shop assistant Our goods are all good quality. (Taking out box after box for her to see. She looks at dozens of boxes.)</p>
<p>Middle-aged woman (Very happily pointing to a box) Yes, yes. This is the one. How much does this box cost?</p>
<p>Shop assistant Madam, it only costs four yuan a box. How many boxes do you want to buy?</p>
<p>Middle-aged woman I don't want to buy any. It's just that someone happened to give me a box like this, and I want to ask about the price.</p>
<h3>Special Habits of Several Friends Pine Shadow</h3>
<p>People's preferences are like their faces; each has its own characteristics, whether sweet, sour, bitter, or spicy. For example, Gu Hongming's fondness for small feet, Tan Yankai's love of pig trotters, Zhang Taiyan's habit of playing with bronze Buddhas when writing, and Wu Tingfang's love of humorous conversation are all well-known. Friends also have their own particular preferences, and I will record a few to provide material for after-dinner conversation.</p>
<p>Yu Youren likes to wear cloth socks. The beautiful beard of Yu Youren, a prominent figure in the Party and the country, is no less impressive than that of Guan Yu. Many people recognize him. His life also has its own special characteristics. Regardless of age (young, middle-aged, or old), season (spring, summer, autumn, or winter), or location (north, south, center, or foreign), for decades, he has only worn old-fashioned white bamboo cloth socks. He has never worn the popular double-strand cotton and silk stockings. The big-bearded Mr. Yu is indeed a loyal customer of Hong Mao Chang.</p>
<p>Tu Luyi, the "Bathhouse Inspector." Wang, a close associate of Yu, once served as the Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Central Party Headquarters. He is currently the head of the Chinese Literature Department at Anhui University. He is a romantic and talented individual. Last year, while living in Shanghai, he was bored and, in his spare time, diligently bathed. He tried all the large and small bathhouses in the Public Concession, French Concession, North and South cities, and Pudong, and is very familiar with the layout, prices, and services of each bathhouse. Friends call him the "Bathhouse Inspector Commissioner."</p>
<p>Jiang Tianduo Collects Cigarette Holders. Jiang Tianduo, a lawyer who previously served as the Director-General of the National Water Conservancy Bureau and the Vice Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, is a lifelong enthusiast of smoking cigarettes, especially collecting cigarette holders. Over the years, he has acquired no less than several hundred types. The prices range from over 500 yuan for an expensive one to only a few cents for a cheap one. They come in all shapes and sizes and are truly unique. When arranged and displayed, they resemble a cigarette holder exhibition.</p>
<p>Chu Wenjuan Resists Ear Piercing. Female new literary writer Chu Wenjuan... Chess World Joke by Shen Shouruo</p>
<p>Our country's chess skills have unfortunately fallen behind, often allowing the Japanese to take the lead. This, although a small matter, is enough to glimpse the subtle signs of national strength and weakness. Therefore, people are also competing and trying their best to improve. The competitive spirit is flourishing, cultivating local talent and creating national glory. This is also a good sign.</p>
<p>While we were contemplating the layout of the chess pieces, we heard a joke that made us laugh heartily. The storyteller said that upstairs in a certain chess club, some people were playing Go, while downstairs, two people were playing Chinese chess. Occasionally, they argued and even resorted to violence, causing a great commotion for some time. Later, the two of them understood each other, stopped fighting, and said that the people playing Go upstairs were quiet and not as rude as them, which made them feel ashamed. They decided to go upstairs to watch. When they got upstairs, they saw one person grabbing the other's throat, locked in a stalemate. They then realized that they were also arguing, but silently. There have always been jokes and strange tales, but rarely chess jokes, so I wrote it down.</p>
<p>...publishes works in various publications without adding the word "Ms." to her name. If the editor adds it, she sends a letter requesting that they not do so again next time. She is now almost thirty years old and has never worn earrings. Since childhood, she has refused to pierce her ears, so she has no earrings to wear. Her revolutionary nature is innate, so her works also avoid describing sensual or erotic content.</p>
<p>Li Jianfeng Collects Talismans. Li Jianfeng, a epigrapher, has spent over forty years collecting talismans and incantations from various regions. He has also searched extensively in remote areas such as Tibet and Outer Mongolia. He currently has over 9,270 types, which are mounted in ten large volumes. Each page is labeled separately, indicating the source and application. It is said that he spent over a hundred yuan on a few pages to acquire them. If compiled and photographed, it would become a grand compendium of talismans, an indispensable material for researchers of society.</p>
<h3>Preparations for the Great Cleaning Wang Meiyu</h3>
<p>The Bureau has issued a proclamation that the 25th day of the 12th month of the national calendar will be the day for the great cleaning. It is said that residents everywhere dare not disobey. There are many interesting stories during this preparation period. Please record them to enrich this talk. A long-time friend who lives near Suzhou and Hangzhou came to Shanghai yesterday to talk over drinks. He mentioned the implementation of the national calendar and said that the three dynasties of Zi, Chou, and Yin built it successively, which is not surprising. Then he told the recent stories of the Li and Zhou families in his hometown. The Li family is relatively well-off. A female servant named Chen has been employed for more than five years. She is extremely cautious and willing. Her home is not far away, but no one has ever come to visit. The master doubles his efforts to take care of her. All the belongings are entrusted to her management. Recently, the master said that he would comply with the order to carry out a major cleaning. She was very unhappy. She said, "Why bother with this trivial matter? Besides, we live in a remote rural area. Who will actually see it?" The master laughed at her stubbornness. Then Chen suddenly claimed to be sick and asked to leave, presenting her luggage for inspection one by one. She left early the next morning. After she left, a neighbor told the master that Chen had too many items with her. After the master inspected carefully, he found that some clothing, ornaments, cups, and chopsticks were missing. It turned out that although no one came to Chen's home, she would go home three or four days every one or two months to celebrate. This time, the cleaning order was issued outside of her normal return period, so she was forced to flee. This is one story. At the same time, an even more interesting thing happened in the neighboring village of Zhou. Zhou's household has two wives, the first wife Huang and the second wife Shen. Both are from small families. They are distinguished as older and younger based on the order in which they entered the door, but neither is his original wife. Huang is more straightforward but lacks harmony. Her interactions with Shen are sometimes talkative and laughing, sometimes conflicted and quarreling, but without any preconceptions. Shen, on the other hand, never offends. Huang is happy, she is happy; Huang is angry, she is not angry. Many people praise her. She is also more beautiful than Huang. Zhou knows a little about writing and can read newspapers. He also has the ambition to present himself to society and find a small position. He usually pays attention to the policies of the National Government. Yesterday, he told his two wives that they should enjoy themselves as much as possible during the upcoming New Year and that they should comply with the order to carry out a major cleaning on the 25th day of the 12th month. Huang, being impatient, immediately started tidying up the scattered items in the room. Zhou sat by and watched. Shen suddenly came in and laughed, "You're sweating profusely! Why are you in such a hurry?" She helped Huang tidy up. Huang refused, but Shen didn't listen and said, "There are three people in the room. I certainly won't be a thief in a trunk!" Then she pushed Huang to sit for a while. As she was pushing, something fell from Huang's sleeve to the ground. Zhou picked it up and his expression changed. He asked, "Who is she? Who is she? And why are you taking this side-by-side photo with her?" Huang said, "This is just a little sister dressing up and taking pictures. Who did you think it was?" Shen laughed again and said, "Where is that person? Quickly call her over and it will be clear!" Zhou still shouted loudly to clean out this thief. This is another story. I asked if he had witnessed both events. The long-time friend said, "I heard one and saw the other."</p>
<h3>Travel Notes on Southeast Asia (112)</h3>
<p>Burmese women are also very willing to marry Chinese men, as they want to enjoy comfort and avoid their own hard work. They especially welcome those in the Chinese education sector. Chinese men often marry a Burmese woman locally and use her language skills and business acumen to cooperate and become wealthy. This often happens, and it is also the most convenient path to wealth. There are already many people of mixed Chinese and Burmese ancestry. Many Chinese live in villages and engage in commerce and industry throughout the country. There is almost no place where they are not present. The depth of this relationship should not be underestimated.</p>
<p>Traveling in various ports in Southeast Asia presents a common difficulty. The confusion of languages and names is already a problem, but the street names posted on the street walls by Westerners are too small, and sometimes they are blurry and unclear, making it difficult to find them. Finding street names is the most important task for the municipality, and everyone needs to do it. How can the characters be small and blurry? I remember that the citizens of Nanjing once had an exemplary action that was worthy of being the best in the world. That is, every main street has a specially erected archway over ten feet high, with the street name written in large characters. This point is very commendable. Without comparison, one cannot know the strengths and weaknesses of oneself and others. In various ports in Southeast Asia, the ditches and sewers are not covered, which is very harmful to hygiene.</p>
<p>Burma has the name "Golden Burma" (GOLDBURUINA), allowing people to share its riches. The British take over its full authority. The Indians, the rich become big merchants, the intelligent become officials. Indians are often used as officials, second only to the British. The lower class are the so-called "Kala people" who pull rickshaws, shave heads, and sell coffee and tea. The Japanese, both men and women, often practice medicine here. Everyone eats in Burma and returns fully loaded. Burma gets poorer day by day, but because of abundant rainfall, rice production, timber, silver mines, and gems are produced in limitless quantities. Burmese people are still content and happy. The Great Golden Pagoda of Burma is indeed a great benefactor.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (3) (4) (3) Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Earnestly Asks the Teacher for Advice, Heroic Women Feast in the Brothel, Talking Boldly About War</p>
<p>Time passes even faster in confusion. In the blink of an eye, it is already March or April. The spring god has created many light green and rich green clothes and put them on many tall and short branches. They are also decorated with countless red, purple, yellow, and white ornaments, dressing up a spring earth in a magnificent and unparalleled manner. Everywhere, men and women are frolicking in the spring. That prosperous and famous Shanghai does not have any place for outings. Only in March, people go to Longhua to see peach blossoms, run horse-drawn carriages, and after the emergence of cars, they go there to take a car ride. In fact, it can be considered meaningless to the extreme. Therefore, people who have lived in Shanghai for a long time, if they want to change the air, still go to Suzhou and Hangzhou to walk around. There are many places to travel. Shanghai has no scenic spots and no historical sites, only full of foreign stench. However, the horse races in spring and autumn every year are still closed and the market is closed. Many people run to watch the horse races. The brothels in Shanghai take advantage of this name to ask guests to eat a few more tables of wine. Crows are all black in the world, and the madams are all the same. Seeing the guests, they all ask them to eat wine and play cards. Zuo Shichen often walks around in Luyi's place. Even if they don't ask him, he feels embarrassed not to fulfill a little obligation. At that time, he agreed on a date, and Zuo Shichen went to write an invitation ticket to summon many friends. Naturally, Ling Zhixiang, Lin Fanzi, and Long Ziyun were indispensable. Among the new friends, there were also Wei Ziyi and Sun Qilei. Originally, Wei Ziyi and Zuo Shichen were classmates. Although Wei Ziyi was from Biling, he often lived in Suzhou. After Mr. Xu passed the imperial examination, he taught in his home, specializing in teaching the two brothers. At that time, Zuo Shichen was engaged in the study of writing test papers and followed that old Mr. Xu. Every month, he had to write nine articles. Mr. Xu urged him very strictly. If he wrote one less, he would be uncomfortable and would ask you why you wrote one less this month. Originally, his writing schedule was three, six, and nine, the third, sixth, and ninth of each month, the thirteenth, sixteenth, and nineteenth, the twenty-third, twenty-sixth, and twenty-ninth. While Mr. Xu was teaching students in his home, he would also invite you to his home for an interview on the writing schedule. He was willing to invite you to eat a meal so that you could not escape from writing articles. But if you wrote nine articles every month, he would also correct nine articles every month and never leave them there unattended. Zuo Shichen was his favorite student, so later, when he taught at the Wei family, he often taught him to send his articles to him to see. At that time, Wei Ziyi and Wei Ziqian were still young, only eleven or twelve years old and seven or eight years old. All day long, they would not stop in their chairs. When they saw Senior Brother Zuo coming, they were very happy. Because the teacher and Senior Brother Zuo were talking about articles, they could stop reading their books.</p>

<h3>Securities Prices Continue to Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Transactions Exceed 5.1 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai securities market for various public bonds and bonds saw spot transactions totaling 23,500 yuan, including 16,000 yuan for 19 customs bonds. Other transactions were extremely rare. The futures market turned bleak again. The atmosphere in the market was also very scattered. It was estimated that the morning market had over 2.8 million yuan, and the afternoon market had about 2.3 million yuan, totaling 5.3 million yuan. Disarmament bonds accounted for over 1.4 million yuan, which was relatively high. 19 customs bonds only accounted for over 1 million yuan, 19 relief bonds accounted for 870,000 yuan, and 96 and allocated pension bonds each accounted for 610,000 yuan, remaining as quiet as before. As for the changes in the prices of various bonds, the market turned bleak again, and the forces on both sides remained balanced, so the price trend was more sluggish than the previous day. As a result, there were fluctuations compared to the previous day. The spot price of 19 customs bonds increased by 89 jiao, the spot price of allocated pension bonds increased by about 0.5 yuan, and the futures prices of 6 and relief bonds fell by 45 jiao. The remaining bonds fluctuated by only 12 jiao.</p>

<h3>Strong Demand for Yarn, Yarn Market Shows Beauty</h3>
<p>The yarn market is firm due to strong actual sales. All parties are in high spirits, causing people to become firm. However, overseas conditions are flat and weak, so there are still many people with short-selling ideas. However, because the base is too dry and current sales are active, those who are bullish are more intense, so the market trend is increasingly beautiful.</p>
<p>Bullish Buyers Discovered on the Human Standard The market atmosphere was tight at the opening of the market. Each month rose by 6.7 cents. Some were sold in the second and third rounds. As a result, each month rose by 1.2.5 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that the transaction of spot yarn was good, and the market atmosphere was tight again. The near month rose by 1.2.3 cents, and the far month rose by 7.9 cents. Statistics of the whole day's transaction totaled 19,050 bales. It was found that Tiancheng sold 1,250 bales, Yiyu sold 1,250 bales, Yudai sold 700 bales, Rongxing sold 550 bales, Shendai sold 700 bales, and the rest sold 3.4.5 hundred bales. Dafeng bought 1,400 bales, Ruidai bought 1,150 bales, Shenxin bought 950 bales, the rest bought 750 bales, and the rest bought 2.3.4 hundred bales. The closing price is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Human Standard Closing Price</p>

<h3>The Month's Final Soaring Flower Prices</h3>
<p>Dispersed short selling, no spot goods prepared</p>
<p>Buyer momentum increasingly high</p>
<p>Today is the final day for this month's flower bidding, and market prices have soared by 1.25 taels, a drastic price surge rarely seen recently. The main reason is that most retail investors had no spot goods prepared and, seeing the global cotton market weak and spot sales stagnant, most confidently went short without covering their positions. However, buyers had been preparing for this for a long time, and their momentum became increasingly fierce. Only the Hankou merchants engaged in some hedging. Spot goods transactions in the market were unusually quiet, and the future of the cotton market seemed particularly uncertain.</p>
<p>Recently, Hankou futures jumped wildly by 1.5 taels. Hankou futures opened higher in the morning session, with buying interest relatively strong due to a slight rise in US cotton, with this month's situation serious, up 2.25 cents, while distant months were flat. In the afternoon, market sentiment for this month was tense, with strong buying interest and a sharp price surge. This month rose 1.2 taels and 25 cents, distant months rose 5 cents to 1 cent. Total transaction volume for the day was 98,400 dan. Sales included Yu Da with 49,000 dan, Gong Tai with 45,000 dan, Tian Long with 46,000 dan, Guang Feng with 33,000 dan, Xin Cheng with 52,000 dan, and Da Fu with 41,000 dan. The remaining were 1,000-2,000 dan. Purchases included Chang Feng with 54,000 dan, Mao Ji with 38,000 dan, Shen Chang with 18,000 dan, Jin Feng with 28,000 dan, and Li Chang with 22,000 dan. The remaining were 2,000-3,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hankou Futures Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Open Interest: March 3210...128400, December 3495, up 150, 440000, April 3210...90, 000, January 5255, 1112400, May 3215...51, 200, November 3220...121, 400</p>
<p>Spot consumption extremely weak. Spot cotton transactions are extremely quiet. Arrivals included 150 bales of Tong cotton, 110 bales of Yao cotton, and 31.50 bales of Rangoon cotton. San You Factory took in 300 pieces of spot goods sent to Hangzhou.</p>
<h3>US and UK Cotton Slightly Recover and Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton slightly recovered and firmed due to good news from Liverpool and strength on Wall Street, and a lack of sellers. Futures rose 8 to 11 points, spot goods rose 5 points. UK cotton futures rose 5 points, spot goods rose 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods were unchanged. Indian cotton market closed. The original telegram is recorded below (dated 24th):</p>
<p>US Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Equivalent to Shanghai Standard: UK Cotton Compared to Previous Day, Equivalent to Shanghai Standard: 192, up 1, 037.40, 3528, up 5, 41.10, 3998, 838.40, 5540, 542.00, 5102, 81039.60, 1564, 542.90, 7105, 21140.50, Spot 5313, 41.30, 11070, 11.20, Egyptian 785, Flat, 61.00, Spot 9855, 37.90</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, rice boats from the interior arrived in Shanghai in succession, totaling about 50 boats. Sales were excellent in all directions, especially for northern japonica rice. High-quality rice slightly firmed, rising by two cents in the middle, and the market was quite brisk. Top-grade rice is about to reach the 14 yuan mark. Thin-husked rice is actively being sold off, and arrivals are still being received. Prices are gradually rising by one or two cents. Sales of Yangxian rice are turning brisk, and transactions are booming. Sales of Duxian and port Xian rice are also good. Various stores are actively stockpiling. Market prices are generally good, rising by one and a half cents. Through transactions, sales are even. Rice mills have slightly reduced production, and the market is becoming tight, approaching one cent. High-quality Yin Yuan rice is becoming scarce, sales are brisk, and prices have risen by one cent.</p>
<p>Huh Nan: Yesterday, over ten boats arrived at Hebu. This street is focused on buying middle-grade rice, so top-grade regular japonica rice only rose by a little over one cent, while middle and lower grades rose by as much as two or three cents. Top-grade Tongli japonica rice once reached the 12 yuan mark. South merchants: Rice is scarce and the market is active. Prices have therefore followed suit, rising by one and a half cents. Although arrivals of Yangxian and Duxian rice are being received, sales are very good and the market has also rebounded by a little over one cent. The situation is quite good. Sales of Bianyin, etc., are average, and the market is slightly tighter.</p>
<h3>Local Sales of Ke Xian Rice Are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Ke Xian rice saw slightly more active demand on this street due to concerns that the inland rivers might freeze after the cold weather, potentially reducing arrivals. Therefore, demand for Ke Xian rice was slightly stronger. Total market transactions were around 2,000 bags, a significant improvement compared to the previous day when there were no transactions at all. Prices showed some signs of firmness. However, due to the continued arrival of small quantities in recent days, and the presence of low-priced Dugen and Duxian rice from the lower reaches of the river, prices are difficult to rise in the Ke merchant community. The quoted prices were 10.018 to 10.07 yuan for Nanjing milled rice, 11.4 yuan for Jiangxi milled late rice, 11.25 to 11.18 yuan for Hunan milled rice, and 11.2 yuan and 9.94 yuan for milled oil rice, all purchased by this street.</p>
<h3>Standard Yellow Soybeans and Bean Cakes Slightly Firm</h3>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grain Exchange will be closed starting today.</p>
<p>The red trading board will open on January 3rd next year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of standard soybeans and bean cakes was very active as the market approached closure. Those who intended to grind the beans before the end of the year were bound to settle their accounts. However, the buyers were oil mills and re-exporters, who mainly insisted on receiving the goods upon maturity, while the sellers, although having goods to deliver, had many speculative customers. Therefore, the market saw stronger buying interest. Furthermore, a telegram from Dalian reported that the prices of both bean cakes and soybeans had slightly firmed. Currently, spot trading is still active, and the situation seems quite stable. As a result, futures prices for bean cakes in March, April, and May all rose by 2.5 cents, futures prices for soybeans in January rose by 3 cents, in February and May rose by 1 cent, and in March and April rose by 2 cents. The Miscellaneous Grain Exchange is scheduled to reopen the red trading board on January 3rd next year.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Fell in the Morning and Rebounded in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, although there were no quotations for foreign wheat, most people felt that the amount of hedging by the factories was quite large, and the environment was not very favorable. Therefore, market sentiment for each month was quite weak, falling by 3, 4, 5, and 6 cents compared to the previous day. However, after the opening in the afternoon, due to the approaching New Year's holiday, yesterday was the last day, and short sellers who had profited rushed to cover their positions, causing both near and distant contracts to rebound by 2 and 3 cents. However, overall, it is difficult to be optimistic before the red trading board opens, as the import of foreign wheat is expected to be most active in January and February. (Fuxin recently received two shipments of about 8,000-9,000 tons each).</p>
<h3>Flour Market Flat in the Near Term, Strong in the Distant Term</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the flour market, after the opening in the morning and afternoon, the market showed signs of being flat in the near term and stable in the distant term. In the initial morning trading, because sentiment was not unified, the three near-term months fell by about 1 cent compared to the previous day. Later, with outside short sellers rushing to cover their positions, the sluggish situation immediately turned stable and brisk, and the factories also stopped selling. Because the market lacked selling interest and buying interest was quite strong, each month showed a positive trend. Bidding for this month ended yesterday, while bidding for distant months will take place on the 27th. After observing the market trends, the market should fluctuate. Excessive ups and downs will have to wait until next year. As a result, this month was better by 2.5 cents compared to the previous day, January was better by 5 cents, February was better by 7.5 cents, March was better by 1.5 cents, and April and May were better by 1.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Sugar Rises to Nine Taels</h3>
<p>Japanese sugar prices are rising even more sharply. This factory's rock sugar continues to rise by 2 cents.</p>
<p>Icing sugar opens extremely briskly. Over 1,000 bags of new green sugar are flooding in.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from the sugar production areas due to the Christmas holiday. Market sentiment at the Exchange was quite good, and sales have turned active. Demand is increasing in various parts of the interior. The Changzhou and Wuxi areas are particularly eager to buy sugar because the implementation of the unified tax has increased costs. As a result, market prices are gradually rising. The rapid pace of this trend has been rare in recent years. At the beginning of the market, Dutch sugar (24 degree coarse white sugar) rose by 8 taels and 9 cents, with 500 bags traded, but there was a shortage of sellers and strong buying interest. Prices rose to 9 taels, and trading became more active. High-quality sugar reached 9 taels and 9 cents, and the market was quite firm. 18-degree medium white sugar was priced at 8 taels and 3 cents, and 20-degree sugar was priced at 8 taels and 5 cents, with few buyers. Dutch brown sugar also rose sharply at the same time, with 8-degree sugar priced at 7 taels and 7 cents to 7.5 cents, 9-degree sugar at 7 taels and 8.5 cents, and even 10-degree sugar rose to 8 taels. The market was also not weak. Japanese sugar prices rose even more sharply, and trading was very busy. The market was extremely chaotic. At the beginning of the market, YT grade was priced at 8 taels and 8 cents, then immediately rose to 9 taels. YRO grade was priced at 8 taels and 4 cents, YP grade was priced at 9 taels and 3 to 9 taels and 4 cents, Meiji sugar was priced at 9 taels and 4 to 5 cents, TM grade was priced at 8 taels and 7 cents, and TK grade was priced at 8 taels and 8 cents to 9 taels and 5 cents. Buying interest was still strong, and later prices were called up by one cent, but there were few inquiries. The market was very firm. Nanyang Factory opened the market with over 200 bags of this factory's rock sugar, with grade 1 priced at 11 taels and 3 cents, and grade 2 at 11 taels and 1 cent, a sudden increase of 2 cents compared to the previous session. At the same time, Shanghai Factory also raised prices, and prices are expected to rise again. The icing sugar market also opened higher, with Yuxiang, Yufa, and Jinxing Factories each opening with 500-600 bags, priced at 7 taels and 7.5 to 7 taels and 8 cents, and high-quality sugar at 7 taels and 9.5 cents, totaling over 1,000 bags, and the market was quite brisk. Since the arrival of a large shipment of domestic new green sugar from Zesheng the day before yesterday, over 1,000 bags were opened yesterday, priced at 2 taels and 8 cents, a gradual decrease of 2 cents compared to the previous session, but the market seemed quite stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Double Palace Silk Sales Clear, Prices Weak</h3>
<p>The current market only opens at 470 taels, a decrease of 20 taels compared to the previous session. The Double Palace Silk market in this port has seen market prices gradually rise due to smooth sales of domestic silk fabrics, with a very rapid upward trend. The price of high-quality Double Palace Silk rose from 420 taels to 490 taels. Recently, with the Shanghai port's silk transported to Zhejiang and Jiangsu, the government has approved duty-free passage, and sales of Double Palace Silk machines have been greatly affected. In addition, with the approach of the New Year and the clearer sales appetite of silk merchants, silk prices have gradually fallen. The current price of high-quality Double Palace Silk is only 470 taels, a decrease of 20 taels compared to the previous fall.</p>
<h3>The Most Scarce and Popular Textiles and Woolens Recently</h3>
<p>Including Sea Tiger Velvet, etc. (four or five kinds)</p>
<p>Recently, due to the cold weather, transactions in wool and woolen goods have been very brisk, and the number of orders received by shops for custom-made coats has increased sharply. Tailors are rushing to complete orders day and night. General wholesale transactions seem to be slightly quieter, perhaps due to the approaching New Year. However, there are many goods that are in short supply, prices are rising, and buyers are in urgent need of them, such as Sea Tiger velvet, Melton cloth, camel wool, 1.6-foot velvet, and gray felt cloth. Buyers have recently been eager to purchase these goods, but most of them have already been sold out and are difficult to find. Yesterday, Sea Tiger grade was sold at around 8 or 9 taels, and camel wool was priced at 7 taels, 5 or 6 cents, but they were hard to come by. Melton cloth, which was sold for 1 tael and 5 cents at the beginning of autumn, is now difficult to obtain even at 2 taels, 4 or 5 cents. Shoe manufacturers are making every effort to find 1.6-foot velvet and gray felt cloth, and sales prices have increased by 2 or 3 cents. In addition, lower-grade 1 tael, 7 or 8 cents of mixed-color serge, single-sided Yuan Zhigong cloth, and various types of fancy cloth and mandarin jacket cloth priced at 4 taels are also in very short supply. Those in the industry with ample funds are eager to buy and stockpile these goods because it is expected that the spring textile and woolen market will improve significantly due to the current tight exchange rates and the upcoming increase in import duties.</p>

<p>Qing Yuan (Green Field)</p>
<p>An Impression of Jiming Temple (by Qing Yu)</p>
<p>It was exactly the third day of my arrival in Nanjing when Fu Dong came to visit me. Upon meeting, we felt an indescribable emotion. If you call it happiness, after three years of separation, we had both experienced unexpected changes, and our appearances had also changed considerably. We were also filled with unknowable conjectures about the future. If you call it sadness, we were both still alive upon meeting, so why be sad? For a moment, we both suppressed the words we wanted to pour out. No, at this moment, we couldn't explain it. We suppressed the surging emotions in our hearts and maintained a normal attitude. Fu Dong asked me why I came.</p>
<p>(I've wanted to come to this place for a long time. In addition, the great upheaval caused by bandits in my hometown forced me to move, so I came here.)</p>
<p>Actually, I don't feel much flavor here, but at least I'm a little less frightened.</p>
<p>(Isn't that also suitable for my purpose? I also just want to rest from the shock. But isn't this an old city? A new capital? The relics of the past, the emerging constructions, the scenic mountains and rivers, I can all admire them.)</p>
<p>(Okay, come along, you'll know for yourself, but that's all there is to it, don't be too excited.)</p>
<p>He spoke without much excitement, but then continued,</p>
<p>(We've been separated for too long, so of course we should spend the whole day together today. But how would you like to spend this precious day?)</p>
<p>(It's up to you to arrange it, I'm a newcomer here.)</p>
<p>(Let's go to Jiming Temple to spend the day, we need to pour everything out to each other as much as possible.)</p>
<p>With that, we came out and headed towards Beijige. It wasn't very far from Huangnigang to Beijige, so naturally we arrived in a while. Under the gloomy weather, after passing through a newly renovated but desolate road that seemed to be a forest but felt too monotonous, we began to climb the mountain. At this time, sparse raindrops had already begun to fall. There was no one else on the mountain road, only the sound of rain on the leaves harmonizing with our soft conversation. After turning two or three bends, we glimpsed a few dilapidated statues of gods, and then we arrived at the temple gate. At the temple gate stood a man in gray clothes carrying a gun, which suddenly startled me because the atmosphere of my hometown made me react particularly sensitively. I thought we couldn't go in, but Fu Dong had already stepped into the temple gate, so I followed him in. I don't want to describe everything inside the temple. I think everyone who has been to Nanjing knows about it.</p>
<p>We walked into the [Tea Room] and sat down next to a table with windows on two sides. When I looked inside, there was still no one there, only heavier rain falling outside the building. After a while, a person carrying a water bottle and a snack box came to make two bowls of tea for us. I craned my neck to look out the window, and Fu Dong pointed out to me where Taicheng was, where Tianbao City was, and where Xuanwu Lake was. So I quietly enjoyed the magnificent scenery of the river and mountains and the quiet, lonely rain. Fu Dong didn't say anything, just drank tea by himself. So I thought of Emperor Wu of Liang, who came from a prominent family and established a kingdom and dominated the world. I thought of him throwing himself into Buddhism, and I thought of him being trapped by Hou Jing. I admired his heroism and pitied his ignorance. I even suspected that heroism and ignorance should be used as linked words. In less than a quarter of an hour, all the historical sites of Jiangnan that I could remember had been replayed in my mind. What were my feelings? I couldn't analyze it myself at the time. I just felt that there was a kind of artistic conception in my heart. This artistic conception didn't seem to be exclusive to the ancients, and it seemed to be very closely related to myself, even to the trivial matter of my reunion with Fu Dong. But I finally couldn't figure out what that would have to do with me.</p>
<p>I turned to look at Fu Dong. He was sitting with his back to the window, his feet propped up on another stool, his eyes seemingly fixed on the three words "Tea Room". He was chewing on a piece of dried beef that I had brought from my hometown. He didn't know I was looking at him. After a while, he suddenly shook his head and softly said,</p>
<p>(Not clever.)</p>
<p>Why did he suddenly utter this three-word exclamation? I suddenly felt strange. Could it be that he said the words were not well written?</p>
<p>(Hey, what are you commenting on?)</p>
<p>(I didn't think about anything.) He shook his head and responded with an irrelevant reply. Suddenly, he suddenly ordered me,</p>
<p>(Look at these couplets, why must they talk about the golden powder of the Six Dynasties? Why must everyone strike up such an antiquated tone of no return? This is our new capital.) He stopped speaking, chewing his beef.</p>
<p>I was idle at the time, so I also read those couplets and looked at the names signed on them. Indeed, there was no vitality in them at this time. All kinds of decorations on the floor were opposite each other, each in a daze. The various meanings in the couplets pressed down on the air on the floor, and it naturally became desolate. Looking into the distance again, the lake, mountains, city walls, and misty rain were tightly locked, making the whole scene a dizzy world. So all the scenic spots and a history of Jiangnan disappeared from my chest. I couldn't even think about where I was now and why he had come here. Suddenly, I thought of my hometown, my world of soldiers and bandits, my educational experience, my life full of holes, etc. I also sighed deeply, (I'm tired of it).</p>
<p>Fu Dong stood up, took a sip of tea, smiled at me and said,</p>
<p>(Actually, Jiming Temple can be given a new meaning. "In the darkness of the storm, the rooster crows endlessly." Shouldn't these two sentences be worth reflecting on for those in the newly built capital? After thinking again and again, although we have also experienced many vicissitudes, actually the days of this life are still very long. If the heart turns to ashes too early, isn't the second half of life even harder? So no matter how difficult life is, you have to cheer yourself up. Although I now often find fun in leisure, leisure often gives me such nostalgia. I always feel that my destined path has not been completed.)</p>
<p>Then he told me very happily about his experiences in the past few years, which were completely different from when he came. I also left the floor and the scenery and listened attentively. We seemed to see the sunlight, see the grassland, see the flowing water, and the strength in our bodies seemed to increase as if it were being injected from a small pipe.</p>
<p>When the clouds cleared and the sun came out, we came out of the temple, walked back through the newly refreshed forest after the rain.</p>
<h3>Night Soulless</h3>
<p>Oh, it's as if some strange sound is blowing into my head.</p>
<p>Artsybashev's Night</p>
<p>My heart, like someone buried alive in a tomb, is so depressed it wants to jump out of my body.</p>
<p>The electric light is trembling, just like the turmoil of my emotions, trembling in the same way. The symphony of the night market comes from afar, mixed with the sound of the landladies on the floor below playing mahjong, and the shouts of vendors selling late-night snacks outside. Tonight, oh, these sounds are especially grating on my nerves.</p>
<p>Pray, implore the Heavenly Father to grant strength, to rescue a suffering soul from the throes of pain. I look up at the black sky twinkling with stars, but what's the use? All reason has lost its power, let alone a nonexistent god.</p>
<p>I turned off the electric light. I imagined that darkness might bring peace to my soul.</p>
<p>I shout, but my voice scatters in the darkness without echoing back.</p>
<p>I become angry, I flee the small room, I flee the small room, I want to hit someone, I want to kill someone, and I even want to set a fire.</p>
<p>Finally, hanging my head, silent as a shadow, I tread on the cobblestone road, but the cobblestone road makes me angry. I want to curse the Chinese municipality. I kick the cobblestone road with my leather shoes. A team of police passes by me. Hush, a row of black dogs. Suddenly, I also realize that kicking the cobblestone road with my leather shoes is a loss for myself.</p>
<p>Standing below a tall building, I shout, looking at the windows above,</p>
<p>(Alas, alas, alas!) The sound bumps around on the wall, but there is no answer. Disheartened, I walk away. I think,</p>
<p>(Alas, perhaps he's hiding in his room, organizing a new work, deliberately not answering those who visit him. Bah, you ghoul, I'll go back and work hard too, and finish writing that "Miss Malan.")</p>
<p>But I don't go back on the way back. My soul is roaring,</p>
<p>(Heart, burst open! The surroundings are so desolate, all sounds seem like the silent cries of a mute, meaningless. Women, I definitely don't need anything to do with women. What do I need? I need an earthquake, or else I need to see the sky falling down, otherwise, I'll suffocate. What to do? My heart wants to jump out, but the walls of flesh and bone imprison it firmly. Burst open, heart,...)</p>
<p>As I walk, I suddenly remember that I should go find my enemy. I want to tell my enemy,</p>
<p>(Listen, I beg you to listen, to all these strange dreams. Come, I'll tell you, you are not my enemy, we are good friends, look at my tears. Please come and kiss me. Enemy, I'll tell you, about news of her, she is already sleeping in the arms of a man with four hundred yuan a month. You must believe that I am not deceiving you. Think, why did I disregard life and death to embark on a long march to the North Country when snow was flying last year? Now I have returned south. I heard that she has divorced you too. So I wanted to write you a long letter several times, although this long letter was never written several times, for fear of making people cry, perhaps for fear of making you laugh. Ah, enemy, listen, I've come to vomit everything to you, all these strange dreams,...)</p>
<p>I made up my mind, pushed open his door, and dragged my trembling legs up the stairs.</p>
<p>(You haven't moved?) I say this to him after a long time. Two friends were also sitting in his room. (Yes, I haven't moved. Is there something you need?)</p>
<p>(No, yes, I'm leaving.) I suddenly felt insulted and fled his room. He was still asking, (Is there something you need?)</p>
<p>With a burning face, I left the dark alleyway and entered the noisy street center. The peach-colored shadows of women flutter past, carrying the fragrance of powder, immediately conjuring up thoughts of sexual desire in the minds of young men. The noise of the RADIO at the entrance of a shop is playing a Shanghai dialect ditty, making one's nerves tingle,...)</p>
<p>I stood in front of the GOOSE CAFE, watching a dancing girl with swaying hips go up the stone steps. I wanted to follow her inside. I hesitated, but in the end, I just left there.</p>
<p>I don't need to see women, these, animals with white bodies, things with clever mouths and flowing eyes, goblins with swaying hips,...</p>
<p>I walked away in a huff, depression and vexation still entrenched in my heart.</p>
<p>From the bustling city, I walked into a quiet street. Carrying my disappointment, I trudged back towards my room. By the dark roadside, there were starving beggars moaning. I grabbed a handful of copper coins from my pocket and scattered them to them, but then I regretted it. I felt that this kind of humanitarianism, this act of compassion, was ridiculous.</p>
<p>I returned to the small room again, and turned on the light.</p>
<p>I slumped down at the table cluttered with paper and books, suddenly feeling sadness in my heart.</p>
<p>The night wind cooled my cheeks,</p>
<p>I felt the warmth of tears,</p>
<p>My soul was hypnotized...</p>

<h3>An Outline of Journalistic Literature by Tang Zenghongyang</h3>
<p>Written by Huang Tianpeng</p>
<p>In the past year or two, most of the domestic journalists have paid attention to the practical research of new literature, because in the modern era where journalism is gradually becoming prosperous, if you only rely on past experience in serving the newspaper industry, and the knowledge of journalism that you have obtained sporadically, of course, it is still impossible to use it freely. At least, in terms of theory, you feel lack and bitterness. Therefore, well-known foreign professionals in journalism, in addition to having extremely rich experience in this industry, also have in-depth research on journalism. Because of this, foreign countries pay attention to the reality of the journalism industry after our country, but their rate of development has far exceeded our country. This amazing progress is clear to anyone who pays attention to the journalism industry. Generally speaking, it is because they attach equal importance to practice and research that they have evolved into today's perfect achievements. Moreover, most of the people engaged in journalism in foreign countries have already built a considerable foundation in literature, or it can be said that they are journalism experts and writers. This is a very obvious fact, and I don't need to give examples. In the Chinese journalism industry, there has recently been a gratifying and praiseworthy phenomenon, that is, those engaged in journalism, in addition to using the knowledge they have gained from experience, pay attention to specialized research in journalism, which is of great relevance to the future of the Chinese journalism industry, and at least can promote the progress of journalism and have a new expression. If we continue to work hard in this way academically, perhaps China's journalism industry can keep pace with foreign countries in the near future, which is also an inevitable phenomenon. What makes us particularly happy is that scholars who have specialized in journalism are willing to contribute the insights of this research to the world, which is indeed worthy of our praise. Regarding this, Mr. Huang Tianpeng can be said to be one of the most hardworking and contributing. We only need to see that among the recent massive publications on journalism theory in the market, the most abundant one is undoubtedly Mr. Huang's. This book (An Outline of Journalistic Literature) can be regarded as the most valuable one. We should pay deep attention to it.</p>
<p>Because most of the books on journalism published on the market belong to newspaper editing methods, newspaper interviewing methods, how to become a journalist, and newspaper research, etc. This is also the case in foreign newspapers, but Huang's is the first to discuss journalistic literature. This point alone shows the greatness of the author. Regarding this kind of writing, it is completely based on the thorough research and the best possible expression. There is simply nothing similar to this kind of writing that can be referred to. Those who pay attention to journalism can understand this without any doubt.</p>
<p>The whole book is divided into nine chapters. Each chapter has correct arguments and precise insights. The first chapter (Introduction to Journalistic Literature) talks about the motivation for writing this book, citing the arguments of foreign journalism scholars as the starting point, which is particularly valuable and gratifying. Secondly, it explains the process of the establishment of material science and the relationship between newspapers and history. This point is extremely important in journalistic literature, so the author cites historical facts from ancient and modern China and foreign countries as the basis, in great detail. The necessity of research on journalistic literature is even more vividly expressed. The second chapter (The Establishment of Journalistic Literature) talks about the initial prototype of journalistic literature. Regarding this, the author first argues about the origin of newspapers, and objectively discusses the (China and Foreign News) and (Shiwu Bao) etc., which were published one after another after the war between China and Japan, as well as their article style and the schools of authors. Secondly, it discusses how to create the foundation of journalistic literature, the outline of Chinese literature, and records about journalistic literature. The third chapter (The Characteristics of Journalistic Literature), in order to make it easier for readers to understand, the author divides the characteristics of journalistic literature into three points: (1) timeliness, (2) popularity, (3) interest. Such an analysis is of course very meaningful. At the same time, these three characteristics are further explained, explaining its position and value in literature. The fourth chapter (The Genre of Journalistic Literature) is based on history, which is of course not easy to be wrong. For example, the historical records of the past are (1) Zuo Zhuan style, (2) Historical Records style, (3) Liaozhai style. Secondly, it is the news record, (1) Outline method, (2) Flashback method, (3) Summary method, with detailed explanations. Finally, through comparative research on these three kinds of records, readers can understand their advantages and disadvantages, and the editing methods that should be adopted. The fifth chapter (The Evolution of Journalistic Literature) is described in great detail, and is divided into three sections: (1) The era of political commentary, (2) The era of news, (3) Supplementary edition texts, (4) Conclusion. Especially the third section is mostly the author's unique insights, which can make us feel the same. The sixth chapter (The Changes of Journalistic Literature) first talks about the prediction of the literary revolution, then the process of the revolutionary movement, and finally the various influences of new new literature. This chapter is indeed extremely important, even in history, the changes in journalistic literature also occupy an important position. The seventh chapter (The Classification of Journalistic Literature), the first section is an introduction, (A) the approximate categories of texts on newspapers, (B) the unique characteristics of each, (C) the common principles of literature and art, the second section is commentary, (A) the meaning of commentary, (B) providing problems and annotating news, (C) the classification of commentary, (D) the three major schools in the commentary world recently, (E) the conditions for commentators, the third section is news, (1) telegrams, (A) notes on telegrams, (B) the secret of conciseness, (C) the procedures for compiling telegrams, (D) examples of choosing between special telegrams and foreign telegrams, (2) interviews, (A) the principles and schools of ordinary interview production, (B) the key points of news description techniques, (C) eight methods and examples in two categories of time and space, (3) communications, (A) the connotation and external form of special communications, (B) systematic narration, (C) interesting description, (D) impression notes, (4) headlines, (A) the art of news headlines, (B) revealing the outline and attracting attention, (C) four principles to abide by and four prohibitions, (D) examples of formats, (E) the recent progress view, the fourth section is recreational literature, (A) the two major trends of recreational literature, (B) the enjoyment of modern material life, (C) the appreciation of human spiritual life, the fifth section is advertising literature, (A) the news value of advertising, (B) nature, (C) structure, (D) style, (E) title, (F) various studies, (G) news literature of advertising. This chapter occupies the most space in the whole book, and the excerpts in the sections are extremely detailed, most of which are sufficient for us to refer to. The eighth chapter (The Power of Journalistic Literature), regarding this chapter, the author divides it into four characteristics: (1) universality, (2) continuity, (3) speed, (4) abundance, and the metaphor of human footprints. This kind of discussion should have objective value, because without explaining this kind of power, readers will definitely not be able to understand the unique position of journalistic literature, etc. The ninth chapter (The Future of Journalistic Literature), (1) the popularization of journalistic literature, (2) journalistic literature as the literature of the masses, (3) the discussion of the problem of classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese in newspaper articles, (4) the new trend of Mandarinization. This chapter is really very important in today's journalistic literature. Although the author has hopes for the future, it is also a major problem that needs to be solved most urgently at present. However, the author has explained it in detail and thoroughly here.</p>
<p>In short, after reading Mr. Huang's masterpiece, we can</p>
<p>understand the essential theoretical foundation of journalistic literature. At the same time, the power of newspapers is expanding day by day, so we really need to focus on the study of journalism, and how to improve the domestic newspapers and how to organize them precisely are all matters that must be discussed in detail at present.
