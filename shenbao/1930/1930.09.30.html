<p>聞八卦掌中有隔小掌。能於百步之外擊人。即隔一牆垣。亦能透牆而出。北人之口頭語所謂隔山打牛。百步打空者是也。在前清時常州有護國寺僧普因者。本爲劇盜。能於夜間及天明前。至數十里或百餘里外。刦掠孤單行客。刦後仍返寺中。來去如風。數十里往返。直一瞬息耳。以故寺中不疑普因爲盜。會普因於鷄鳴前。至奔牛左右刦一行客客。囊中有銀二百元。欲至常州販荳。乘黑夜行。爲普因所刦。顧是客生有異禀。凡人一爲所見。即終身能識其人。星光之下。雖面目不易細辨。然已默誌胸中。知爲僧也。普因刦得二百元後。飛馳逸去。客亦踽踽來城。欲求援於親友。且欲遍至各寺。訪此盜僧。先至護國寺餐堂。諸僧方飯。客忽見普因。識其爲盜。然不敢遽發。入訪方丈告之。方丈大驚。急遣普因他往。而搜其行篋。則赫然原贓猶在。方丈欲擒之。而知其武技至高。不易捕獲。求助於天寗寺方丈。方丈派二老僧往助。臨行時方丈戒之曰。汝二人武術雖精。而能否在普因之上。猶未能定。逆計汝輩往時。彼必破屋而上。破屋之時。當視其膝灣之曲直爲衡。兩膝彎曲而上者。汝輩可以擒之。苟不曲而直者。則非汝輩所能敵矣。二僧唯唯而行。同至護國寺。先坐齋堂以俟。無何衆僧畢至。客於諸僧進飯之時。倐然而入。指普因曰。此刦吾二百元之盜也。方丈厲聲曰。擒之。普因已應聲躍起。穿屋而上。顧其膝彎而不曲。天寗寺二僧。亦從穿屋處飛躍而登。一瞥眼間。普因已爲二僧所捕。縛至石灰池焚之。石灰沸騰。縛索盡斷。普因目盲骨露。猶能躍登短。牆以無肉之手撫其肋骨。有一種菜者在旁。見學大驚。以爲怪。舉鋤擊之。立墮池中。輾轉而斃。此天寗寺二僧。一名桂祥。即工於遠打者。能於大殿起火之時。肩兩水桶飛上九丈高之殿脊。其遠打法余曾力請其試臉。先闔其門。於二十餘步之外。一伸其拳。門上即磞然作響。三試皆然。余又欲其擊牛與犬。僧歛手不肯。自云曾任清軍記名提督。因悟澈人生不過如是。是以出家今事隔三十餘年。桂祥久入湼　。其遠打法亦遂無有繼起者。</p>

<p>我國醫術。輒多奇治。往往無理可喻而奏效是神者。有非西方醫學所得而解也。如對口菌之治痼疾。斯亦奇矣。</p>
<p>相傳對口菌生于荒塜破棺間。有菌狀物突出于棺蓋之下層而位置適對屍口者。即爲此物得之。可療百疾。醫癆者尤奇騐。愚初不信。嘗以詢之某名醫。據云。「本草中雖無此藥。然確曾見此物于顯宦盛氏之室。而活人蓋不鮮矣。惟以醫理推之。倘亦爲陰陽交感之結晶物。乎」其後。又聞之某德醫謂「不無此理。其所以得此而療痼疾者。殆爲偶然之事。猶之以符籙治病。病或愈。而實非符籙之功也。」言次乃力言中醫往往以迷信誤人。似亦頗有理。然則對口之菌。乃眞如神活中物。而不可以常理究詰者矣。</p>
<p>昨聞人言明星公司新片十四集紅蓮寺中。即以一「對口菌」爲全片綫索。寫兩派劍客奪菌之事。如火如荼。似龍似虎。變幻百出。離奇萬態。最先此對口菌乃爲一人猿所得。由人猿而輾轉爭奪。頗呈譎詭之觀。然則此對口菌其眞爲神物矣乎。是誠不可解也。</p>

<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>（一）拉普亞運動之由來</p>
<p>最近芬蘭農民之反共運動。即拉普亞運動（Lapua者爲Oatrobothnie之一小敎區名。與Vaasa鄰近。芬蘭反共運動最先發動於該處。故名）頗引起歐洲輿論界之注意。且有慮及此運動可使芬蘭與其東鄰蘇維埃俄羅斯發生衝突。因而牽動歐洲和平者。故吾人不能以其爲北歐小國一隅之事而忽視之。</p>
<p>在述及此運動所以發生之前。當先考察共黨在芬蘭之活動狀况。芬蘭之離俄獨立也。始於一九一七年。自此時起。受莫斯科第三國際指揮與資助之共黨宣傳。即開始在芬蘭活動。各大市區及實業中心地帶之工人雖對之深表同情。但知識階級則完全反對。共黨在芬蘭宣傳之内容與在其他各國同。爲對於政治經濟。宗敎。軍事等現行制度之反對。在國會之演壇上。在各市參事會之議度上。並在各新聞紙上。共黨份子均顯然鼓吹民衆以武力推翻現行制度。又利用芬蘭出版結社自由之法制。使其宣傳日益擴大。</p>
<p>但共黨之活動愈猛。政府之監視愈嚴。毎至必要時期即取嚴厲手段對待。企圖根本消滅其宣傳。一九二三年在國會之共黨議員悉數下獄。其他重要共黨亦均被處嚴重之罪名。且共黨被認爲非法政黨而禁止活動即共一例。</p>
<p>自後多數共黨辦事人員雖被禁獄中。但在俄羅斯組織訓練之新人員。源源不絶潛入芬蘭。塡捕其缺額。因此在最後國會議員選舉戰中。採用工人與小農黨（Parti　des　ourvriers　et　des　pesfta　paysans）名義之共黨份子竟得十三萬票。在總額兩百之國會議席中占去二十三席。</p>

<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（一）引子</p>
<p>在歐洲。近柋的美術是集中於巴黎。在巴黎看慣的人們。到任何一國去看近代的繪畫或彫刻甚至建築。工藝美術。終是十分不滿足的。可是近代美術的源泉是意大利的文藝復興期。文藝復興期的藝術當然是追接着希臘羅馬的藝術。要研究文藝復興及其以前的藝術。那末。非到意大利去巡禮不可。我住在巴黎。是接近近代藝術的時候多。雖然也在羅佛宫看過希臘羅馬的雕刻。看過奇粤圖Giotto鮑顚西列Batticelli佛蘭安琪列果FroAngelico爵約Giorgione瑪刹西奥Madaccio李毘PhilippoLippi孟得尼Mantegua白利尼GiovanniBellini列奥納篤逹文西LeonarddeVinci拉飛耳Raphaele米克朗琪羅Michclangelo蒂湘Titien汀陶萊朶Tintoretto魏洪奈士Veronese的作品。自然先已略略曉得一點希臘羅馬的彫刻以及文藝復興的藝術的輪廓。但是在於我終覺得不夠滿足。心中也終不能釋然放下。近來因爲一意要追溯近代藝術的源泉。就溯着歷史逆行。從現代的新藝術尋求到十九世紀十八世紀法國的繪畫。溯上去到西班牙。荷蘭的畫。一直到意大利的文藝復興。都有他那間接或直接的關係。直截爽快的說一句。歐洲近代的一切藝術。都是源於文藝復興的。因爲這一點。我往訪意大利的心就更熱烈了。這樣巡游的心。却比任何大事件還要深深地留在心底裏。這樣的心情。不但是我其實凡是研究美術的人們。最低限度應該要這樣想的。假使你歡喜特拉克窪Delacroixo你至少應該先明白吕班士Rubens汀陶萊朶。你愛好瑪奈E.Manet你至少要懂得魏拉士貴支Velazquez。你要懂得魏拉士貴支你就不得不研究蒂湘Titien你歡喜塞尙cezanne你至少應該看過魏洪奈斯和格萊哥ElGreco近來從各人的作品上書本上也去追求。關於文藝復興的榮耀的時期的作品的確非到意大利各地去巡游是不能得到澈底的研究的。如果你要看汀陶萊朶。魏洪奈司。蒂湘。諦伯洛Tipolo那末你就應該到威尼斯Venezia去。你要看米克朗琪羅。拉飛耳。鮑顚西列。安琪列果。李毘。刹篤AndreadelSarto逹文西的作品你應該到羅馬和悲冷翠Firenze去。因爲他們的大作品都昌繁地包藏在那些狹小而光明的園地裏。因此我就於十九年五月二十九日從巴黎動身到意大利各地去巡游。可是在這一個月的短時期中。我走的地方有羅馬悲冷翠。威尼斯。米蘭四個美術的名城。看的東西太多了。屢次想提起筆來寫。終是感到像一部二十四史那樣無從說起。現在只得拿我巡游的日記。先在這裏發表。在於美術方面我所感覺着的。還待我充分地認眞地從各方面考據檢查之後再逐段寫出來。我决不願籠統。淺薄地說幾句抽象的話來充内行。終之我巡游意大利以。後我對於意大利的藝。術是一個美而大的信仰。這個美而大的信仰而且是我終身不至於失望的。這是我可以首先告訴讀者的。</p>

<p>九月份標紗在月初頗現不穏之狀、價在一百五十三四兩間盤旋、實以世界棉業情形衰勢不振美棉逐步發現新低價、且時局紛擾不体、以致銷路滯鈍、潮州帮抛賣殊湧、底貨約有十五萬包以外、買方空虚、某廠商雖設法支持、然大勢所趨獨本難持大厦、遂發生一度大跌風、冲破五十兩大關、最低曾到一百四十八兩五錢、未幾北方時局變動、有和平消息晉軍潰退、於是市氣大爲震動、且某廠商繼續購進加碼、市盤一時猛漲、竟躍出五十兩關外、然形勢汹汹、散戸抵補者甚衆、大殺空頭、同時實需較爲起色、人心愈緊、最高曾到一百五十四兩五錢、後以交貨者尙不乏人、五福牧羊套賣尙有三千包、最後一盤以浮戸大意、驟跌二兩八錢、爲一百五十一兩、結果交割價爲一百五十三兩、共計三千六百五十包、實行交割祗一千九百包、其餘一千七百五十包、自行交割計廿五福一千二百五十包、牧羊六百包、十六支紅團龍五十包、收貨仍係恒大爲最多、一九○○包、交貨五藉牧羊爲最多、總貨元五五八·四五○兩、茲將交收兩方經紀人總號及包額、分誌於後、</p>

<p>孟買上週現銷頗形活潑、期貨方面、因遠東出口商之大批買進、跌風爲之一戢、市價堅穏美印間之差價較近、中國於低價中略有成交、日本於週初成交甚旺、其後减退、所有産棉各地之棉收報告均順利、附上週統計如下（單位千包）一九二九年一九三○○年　　九月一日起收數累計四六四二週末現存七四七五六七九月一日起出口累計一一三一六0輸往歐洲三八五三輸往中國三三五輸往日本八八五二其他各地一三　　利物浦上週現需進步、期貨市面之套賣、均爲零星買戸所吸收、但仍不能阻止市價之下落、據報告所述、美政府擬再助農業、然人心依然向空、埃及棉未呈特色、市價隨美棉跌小、週末因亞歷山大多頭了結、跌落尤甚、</p>

<p>閘北昨日裡路來源見稀、祗二十號之譜本街市銷極爽、西新粳河存不多、到亦不旺緣一部份販商受上週狂跌之影響、虧本甚鉅、故資本不充者已無力販運來源减少、而各店方因天宫上午陰雨、買氣甚活、行情續漲半元、頂高開十七元三角、而中關則跳起八角之距、價盤旋於十六元三四角之間東新粳亦步提四五角、大盤十五元七八角、羊杜秈來貨旣稀、走銷反反、價昂四角至五角半、特高貨開十三元半左右、埠尖開高十二元四角、客尖十一元三角、以上兩種回漲祗兩角之譜、市勢平穏、白元到銷兩敵價無榮辱、總觀全日粳秈兩市、完全因天陰關係、致人心不定、惟天如轉晴、價則立可回落也、</p>
<p>滬南河下見到二三十號本街買氣頗暢、情况甚秀、南西兩路新粳悉漲四五角、交易轉旺、而香粳則市勢平淡、到貨雖屬不厚、走銷殊亦欠爽、惟各檔均漲、因乃提升兩三角、價開十四元五角、羊秈由堅而昻、喊高三角許、杜尖亦好起三四角、高貨在十三元關口、通變情况呆穏、價與滬北相彷、此間米情亦以陰晴爲轉移也、</p>

<p>昨日麵粉市况開市後各月份一致狂小、遠期十二月、正二月份尤見疲軟不堪、比之上週收市價跌小有三分之鉅、良以目下洋粉麥市價步下後與國内麥粉兩市頗爲合宜、各廠已定太批外、因市價合划、絡續購定一定後多向交易所套售、以致粉市日見下疲、昨日開市後因人心之看下、行情乃大跌特跌、繼被某廠抵收、市價始復立住但遠期各月份以有洋粉麥到埠、市價終無起色收市本月份祗小五厘、下月不動、十一月份小七五、十二月份小一分半、正月小二分、二月小一分七五云、</p>

<p>期現帶小七八分至錢許</p>
<p>昨日麥市開市後、因被洋麥粉合划到申之影響、開價立小三四分、繼被粉市帶好、浮空略有抵補、但結果又因洋麥定貨之實現遠期一二月份忽見一再狂小、蓋洋麥市價本小、頗合定購、昨日某某等廠又新定一批、特在市上套出、故正二月份小至四兩四錢六七分、比上週小去七八分之多、近期亦帶小三四分、現麥到少存多、廠家久有擯意昨有中小廠家收進三四千包係山東·台莊、清江信陽州等車貨、價祗四兩六錢六七分至四錢半、又比上週小去一錢左右云</p>

<p>無錫各市鄉今歲秋蠶、飼額較去歲約增倍餘、奈因天時惡劣、加以飼種不齊、致收成仍歉、統計四鄉繭産、雖有五六分、而繭質次劣、合於絲廠銷路者祇及三成、各路繭行均已次第收秤、各行收額有限、現均將所收之鮮繭、烘乾雇輪運滬</p>

<p>本廠棉布、市面昨日形勢略疲、尤以細布最軟、原因實銷呆滯、廠家復有大批開出、藍鷄開出有一千五百件、價六兩五錢半、期正二三四月份、彩球陽鶴藍雙魚等價均六兩八錢左右、數逹四五千件、期頭相同、所以人心驟疲、昨現貨一致下落、有五分之譜、藍飛魚爲七兩一錢二分半、彩球六兩八錢半、陽鶴六兩八錢二分半、粗布中三鹿三兎續漲、昨須四兩九錢、但人鐘仍四兩七錢半、細斜益挺、陽鶴已逹七兩三錢二分半、藍雙魚六兩九錢七分半矣、</p>

<p>東白鐵行情、昨日突漲二三分、計三七尺毎張估一兩一錢四分、三六尺九錢一分、聞此次之漲價、實因東匯站定不動、而來貨少、定價高、亦不無若干影響也、惟客帮方面、得此消息、莫不爭收現貨、蓋預防貨價尙須再漲也、聞昨日開出已有六七千張之多、其購進者爲長江内河福建諸帮、此外南京杭嘉湖諸帮亦多點綴云、</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>在沙漠上播種</p>
<p>在沙漠上播種、世界上那有這樣的　子呢、鷗（註）說、「在沙漠上播種才是偉大的工作、因爲這工作難、所以這事業也才偉大而且需要、」</p>
<p>我們何敢當此奬譽、爲了生做人類中之一份子、爲了自已獻身給了藝術、爲了想在我們這文化落後的民族中盡萬一的責任、掙扎着一已的苦痛、在隨處播下些許種粒│况且畸形的社會常會使很多眞誠的工作者失望、灰心、而至於墮落………</p>
<p>在這個僅僅裝飾得富麗堂皇的外表的哈爾濱都市其内容的空虚、會使你如踏進了被掘發過了的空墓一樣的失望、</p>
<p>雖然那些儼然矗立着的建築物、但除了商店裏是堆滿了舶來的洋貨外、什麽文化協會、圖書館、…………裏面固然也養了若干食客、就是有不少中等學校和中等以上的學校、也容有不少青年、…………總之一切只不過裝飾了外表、而且、文化協會是日本人主辦的、所謂中俄合辦的工業大學、裏面一切敎授都由俄人擔任、所有課程都是俄文印本、自然難怪曾有一個工業大學的學生問人、「我國如北平上海的大學裏有没有用中國文的課本的」了、</p>
<p>哈爾濱的没有文化建設、自有充分的原因、過去是俄羅斯的租界、所有一切設施盡是俄國的、如果有文化的話、那是俄國人的文化、租界被收回了、聽說近二年來、的確文化的建設比較的多起來了、但一切空虚、不進步………的原故、是由於政治的壓迫與從事者的對於事業的欺騙和自私、</p>
<p>在哈爾濱從事文化事業、誠然急切的需要了、並且需要的是啓蒙的工作、從播種起始、鷗說、「哈爾濱的文化是如此的荒寂、尤其是文藝界、那簡直還在草野、在沙漠裏、然而在沙漠裏播種………」　　　　自然、我們是在開始懇種這塊草野、在往這片沙漠上播種了、</p>
<p>我很高興我遠遠地流浪到塞外來、並不是全然無益的、但同時我覺慚悚啊、我所知道的能夠去敎授給别人嗎、我應該怎樣地戰戰着努力呢、</p>
<p>「同志們、我們大家努力起吧、替文化努力、替一切都落後的民族創造出光榮的責任、是在我們的身上呢、」</p>
<p>第一次和一羣與我年齡相等的青年藝術學生見面的時候我對他們這樣說、</p>
<p>（註）鷗是北游後新認識的朋友、他是留居在哈爾濱的粤僑、</p>

<h3 id="e9">The Political Friendship Association’s Movement to Replace the Cabinet in Japan <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The ruling period of a country's cabinet is often marked by both fortunate and unfortunate events. Japan's Hamaguchi Cabinet has been affected by the current global commercial downturn. The nation's economy is unable to provide ample resources, and the people's livelihoods are in difficulty. As a result, the opposing Political Friendship Association has raised the banner of overthrowing the cabinet. In fact, from an outsider's perspective, the measures taken by the Hamaguchi Cabinet are ultimately superior to those taken by the previous Political Friendship Association cabinet. The issue of lifting the gold embargo was also advocated by the Political Friendship Association cabinet at the time, but it was delayed and not implemented. The London Naval Treaty would likely have been concluded similarly even if the Political Friendship Association cabinet were still in power. As for the investigation of various bribery cases, these are matters that we outsiders cannot know, but what has been reported in the newspapers is clearly visible to all.</p>
<p>The Hamaguchi Cabinet is most criticized by the opposing party for its austerity policy. In fact, the austerity policy was originally a proactive measure to address the global commercial downturn by deeply understanding it and seeking passive relief. Although its measures may not have been satisfactory, its intentions are not entirely unjustified. If the Political Friendship Association's movement to overthrow the cabinet succeeds, the difficult situation that the succeeding cabinet will face will not be less than today, and may even be worse. This can be predicted by observing the overall global trend and Japan's situation.</p>

<p>(Weihaiwei) Sir Reginald Johnston, Commissioner of Weihaiwei, because the British government will return Weihaiwei to China within days, specially invited village chiefs to his office this morning for a farewell speech. The speech was very sincere and stated that the National Government had promised to fully protect the local area after receiving Weihaiwei, and Foreign Minister Wang had sent a message to British Ambassador to China Sir Miles Lampson stating that China was willing to bear full responsibility for fulfilling this obligation. Therefore, residents need not worry too much about the future security of the region. He then read aloud a telegram from the British Colonial Secretary, stating that the British government, for the sake of friendship with the Chinese National Government, was returning Weihaiwei to China and hoped that the residents of Weihaiwei would continue to enjoy the blessings of peace and prosperity as they had in the past thirty years. He also hoped that Weihaiwei, now a part of a unified China, would see further expansion in culture, wealth, and power. Subsequently, an old village chief delivered a response and presented the Duke with a satin banner inscribed with four large characters. Next, the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce delivered a response, presenting the Duke with a satin banner and a Qinghua ancient porcelain bowl.

<p>泰狄歐的口號是┆</p>
<p>The motto of Tardieu is:</p>
<p>Safety · Arbitration · and Disarmament</p>
<p>Are the Elements that Constitute Peace</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 28th) French Prime Minister Tardieu today clearly explained France's foreign policy in Alençon, stating that France wants to consistently undertake the work of constituting world peace, especially European peace, in political and economic terms. France still believes that peace can be achieved in the formula of Safety · Arbitration · and Disarmament. France is unwilling to reverse the order of these three slogans. Since the era of international sanctions and guarantees has not yet arrived, France will adopt the precautions it can afford to take to protect itself.</p>
<p>(Pacific Press, Paris, 28th) On Sunday afternoon, Prime Minister Tardieu delivered a political speech of great importance. In light of the German elections and before the French parliament reconvenes, Tardieu's words can be seen as an expression of French policy. Regarding agricultural policy, he said that the sales channels for agricultural products must be adjusted. This can be done by bringing together producers, merchants, and consumers, so that, under the guidance of the state, the import and export of agricultural products can be managed. If French agriculture wants to prosper, peace must be the priority, both internally and externally. Regarding the issue of Russia's devaluated sale of wheat, Tardieu expressed the opinion that with wheat prices fluctuating so drastically within a week, the people have the right to demand that the government establish a regulatory body. At present, this agency belongs to the internal affairs of the country, but in the future, it should be extended to the international level, focusing on ensuring that the production and sale of wheat worldwide are well-organized and that no human being lacks food. Tardieu briefly stated regarding foreign policy that this policy has been implemented after much deliberation, with the aim of maintaining peace in both political and economic terms. This is true for the world in general, and even more so for Europe. The details may change with the situation, but the general outline is shared by the national sentiment and does not deviate from its purpose due to partisan narrow-mindedness or personal disagreements. The conclusion states that once treaties have been signed, efforts should be made to uphold them, as this is the foundation of peace, without which peace cannot be spoken of. The Times published a commentary, (the newspaper supports the country's foreign policy) that the intention of peace is consistent from beginning to end. Although the situation, such as the German elections, may contradict it, France's peace policy has considerable flexibility to cope with it. The Discussion Paper also stated (the newspaper also supports the country's foreign policy) that a compromise policy, although it can be unwavering, should not be fooled by it. Other newspapers, because some people predicted that Tardieu would have harsh words about the outcome of the German elections, now recognize that it is extremely noteworthy that he is not so.</p>

<p>Open Criticism</p>
<p>A Whirlwind Arises in Upper China</p>
<p>A Sympathetic Strike Occurs Again in the North</p>
<p>(Reuters, Madrid, 28th) Today, twenty thousand Spanish Republicans from all over the country gathered here for a meeting, the purpose of which is to overthrow the monarchy. This meeting is purely revolutionary in nature, but the speeches are still moderate. Former Liberal Prime Minister Dr. Zamora stated that King Alfonso must abdicate, but the Republicans should avoid causing internal strife or disturbances. There were many other speakers, including an octogenarian, Dr. Casesler, who advocated for republicanism throughout his life. He ascended the podium to denounce the abuses of power by individuals under the current corrupt court. Since the coup in 1923, when the King specially appointed General Rivera as dictator, this is the first time that the Republican Party has convened a grand meeting to openly express its views. The order was good today. Although Spain has abolished censorship, the law still prohibits attacking the king. Therefore, what kind of encounter will these open speakers have? That is a question.</p>

<p>(Reuters, London, 28th) British Foreign Secretary Henderson returned to London from Geneva yesterday and said that the gathering of the League of Nations Assembly, although not as grand as last year, was quite interesting and beneficial. The revision of the League of Nations Charter to align it with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, to make war impossible, is currently under discussion, and it is hoped that the amendment may be passed before the adjournment. As for the optional clause of submitting international disputes to arbitration, many other countries have followed suit since Britain ratified it. He believes that this clause can soon be applied to all countries. Other plans, such as assisting countries that are attacked for no reason, are all related to disarmament and will be handled by the Disarmament Preparatory Commission in Geneva in the coming weeks. Henderson mentioned French Foreign Minister Briand's proposal for a European federation, saying that alongside this is the proposal for a European tariff truce, and further negotiations will be held to reduce tariffs and other economic issues of common concern.</p>

<p>The Assembly Passes Resolutions and Declarations</p>
<p>Strong Criticism of Austerity Policies</p>
<p>(Denstu, Tokyo, 29th) The Seiyukai Party held a general meeting in Nagoya yesterday, sounding the first call for a motion of no confidence in the cabinet in the regions. At the general meeting, the following declaration and resolution were passed: "Declaration:" The current cabinet has absolutely no achievements, and the financial world is extremely uneasy. Internally, it forcibly implements unreasonable economic policies to make the people suffer; externally, it concludes the London Naval Treaty, inviting insecurity in national defense. It is imperative to impeach the current cabinet for these responsibilities, and at the same time, transform policies and open up a gloomy world. Moreover, in order to alleviate the current economic difficulties, there is no other way but to implement the fundamental national policies already established by our party, and immediately establish new policies to address the current situation." "Resolution:" We are working to overcome the recession and speed up the overthrow of the current cabinet." Furthermore, President Inukai's speech that day first attacked the current cabinet's unprepared gold embargo and unreasonable austerity policies, and then discussed the following: To overcome today's general unfavorable situation, it is an absolute prerequisite to abandon the root cause of the austerity policies. Overcoming the unfavorable situation will allow the financial and economic worlds to recover quickly. It is only by implementing the reasonable and proactive policies established by our party to revitalize agriculture and increase industrial production. However, in today's extraordinary times, we cannot abandon it to its natural course. We must guide it with the power of the state. Our party's policy is to provide jobs to those in power and laborers, increase consumer spending, and make the domestic market prosper. Our party has decided to thoroughly reorganize administrative finance, official industries and official property, and implement a 50 million yuan tax cut by economizing on military spending. When we feel that there is a lack of funds to realize industrial policy, it is absolutely permissible to issue public bonds. What should be discussed in the London Treaty is the issue of supreme command and whether it is possible to reduce the burden on the people. However, the government, regarding the issue of supreme command, said before the parliament's response that it would bury supplementary plans, tax cut plans, etc., in the "yes or no," and use the power of propaganda and understanding campaigns to make the cabinet pass the treaty bill. The attitude of the Privy Council, which was taken advantage of by the government's tactics and succumbed to the government, is regrettable according to the original duties of the Privy Council. However, our party only hopes to realize the reduction of the people's burden and ensure that it does not become an expansion of military preparations. We must always adopt a monitoring attitude. In short, the current cabinet has made countless mistakes. For the sake of the country, our party only has to concentrate on overthrowing the cabinet.</p>

<p>(Denttsu, Tokyo 29th) The dispute at the Kameido factory of the Toyo Wool and Silk Company is intensifying. Although 600 police officers heavily guard, rallies are still being held everywhere. Residents nearby are outraged by the police's oppression and show sympathy to the disputing groups. When a rally was held near the dormitories, over 10,000 people nearby came to support them. Therefore, the disputing groups and the general public clash with the police from time to time. The police are deeply afraid of a major escalation, and first removed their swords to fight with iron bars, resulting in many injuries. There is still no hope of resolving the dispute.</p>

<p>(Pacific Press, Berlin, 28th) The government's financial plan, it is said, intends to reduce the expenditures under next year's budget by about another 180 million marks. Therefore, starting from April 1st of next year, unemployment insurance will be increased by 2% each from employers and employees' proportions of contribution, and the funding originally subsidized by the state will be suspended. In addition, it is heard that the salaries of officials will be reduced by 5% to 7%. As for employees serving in commercial offices, it is also intended to consult with employers to handle it in this way. As for transitional measures, the National Bank will lend hundreds of millions of marks to the government, and this matter has been discussed with the French National Bank.</p>
<p>(National News Agency, Berlin, 28th) The German government has ordered that, starting today, the import tax on wheat be increased from 15 marks to 18 marks per tonne, partly because Russia's devaluated sale of large quantities of wheat has caused a major drop in world wheat prices, so German farmers have to be protected. The German government has also decided to reject a certain party's application to extend the import period for frozen meat. Local officials, because fresh meat is needed by the people, intend to find ways to reduce its price.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Central Party Headquarters and National Government's Memorial Week <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 29th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 79th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the Grand Auditorium. Present were Central Committee members Wu Jingheng, Dai Chuanxian, Chen Guofu, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Cheng Tianfang, etc., as well as staff from various departments and committees and guests, totaling about 500 to 600 people. Dai Chuanxian chaired the meeting. After the ceremony, Wu Jingheng gave a report, stating in summary that the central troops are making progress on the front lines every day, which is encouraging from a military perspective. Yan Xishan, under the guise of courteous concessions, is attempting to achieve his ambition of seizing political power, assuming that he can obtain it without effort. However, those who comply survive while those who resist perish, and it is difficult to escape the universal rule. He is only taking the path of self-destruction. Feng Yuxiang, unable to achieve much on his own, is finding it difficult to collude with evildoers, causing his subordinates to superficially praise peace in order to ease the situation. Those in the know all understand that his ambition has not died. Judging from the current situation, he is still relying on the Niangziguan and Tongguan passes, hoping to preserve the remaining strength of the two divisions and revive them in the future. If this is not thoroughly resolved, there is no full guarantee of lasting peace. As for Wang Jingwei, who left Ping after being frustrated and issued a telegram advocating four matters: (1) convene a national conference, (2) reopen the Third National Congress, (3) revise the provisional constitution, and (4) jointly eliminate the Communist Party, the second reason is insufficient, and there is obviously another purpose. The fourth item is a tool for deceiving the people and has no value for discussion. Now, regarding the first and third items, our party initiated the Northern Expedition in the 15th year, cleared the communists in the 16th year, and completed the sound government in the 17th year. It planned to implement the reorganization conference step by step, according to the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, in order to promote unification, consolidate the foundation of the country, and give the people a way to recuperate. Yan and Feng came to Beijing and added obstacles, and the conference barely came to an end, with rebellion arising from it. Fires of war are raging, and the country is in a state of devastation. The people do not even have time to save their own lives. How can they leisurely discuss politics? As for the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, it has many shortcomings. Sun Yat-sen, in order to seek fundamental salvation, formulated the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the Strategies of National Reconstruction, and the Three Principles of the People as the basis for political tutelage, so that the general public could receive adequate training and have a deep understanding. When political tutelage is completed, a national assembly will be convened to produce a constitution and complete a democratic constitutional state. I ask, in this day and age, who can create another law to surpass the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the Strategies of National Reconstruction, and the Three Principles of the People, which were written by the unparalleled Sun Yat-sen? Sun Yat-sen said that knowing is difficult but doing is easy. As long as party members and the general public can understand the principles, they will not overstep the boundaries. The effectiveness of any law is rarely better than this. In this time of crisis, domestic concerns are not yet over, and foreign forces are likely to invade. It is hoped that Yan and Feng can show a little conscience, lay down their butcher knives, and heed the warning that those who are unrepentant will burn themselves. All comrades in our party and compatriots throughout the country should rise up together, follow the principles, abandon destruction and seek construction, in order to reverse the fate of disaster." The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Present were Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Yi Peiji, Jiang Menglin, Zhang Nanxian, Qiu Ao, Liu Ruiheng, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Mu Xiangyue, Zhou Yawei, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yu, Wu Siyu, and over 200 staff members from the National Government's civil service and military affairs departments. Gu Yingfen chaired the meeting. Following the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report, as follows: "Last week, President Tan Yankai passed away, which is a great loss to the party and the country. Everyone knows his revolutionary history, his scholarship is admired by the general public, and his morality is the most unattainable. At this moment, I will list a few points: (1) Self-cultivation: He was willing to suffer losses on small matters and did not engage in unnecessary disputes. On big matters, he had a firm position and dealt with them calmly. This attitude certainly has the style of a great statesman. (2) Tolerance: His mind was like a vast ocean, all-encompassing. He absolutely did not envy those who were higher than him in position, he absolutely did not act impulsively towards those who were equal to him in position, and he absolutely did not show any arrogance towards those who were lower than him in position. In his daily life, he was kind and approachable, with an inviolable dignity. He was indeed a role model for the people. (3) Perseverance: He was always profound and diligent in his work throughout his life, and his spirit was always unremitting. Sometimes, the more difficult the environment, the more his perseverance was shown. He was worthy of being a pillar of the party and the country. (4) Integrity: He did not take a single bribe in the military and political circles for twenty or thirty years. He himself had no savings. In today's China, this alone is enough to rectify bad habits. Since President Tan's revolutionary history, scholarship, and morality are so great, and he was only fifty-two years old, not yet at an age of decline, and yet had signs of premature aging, the reason was entirely due to his devotion to the party and the country. Recently, his health has been extremely poor, and even to the point that he had shortness of breath and could not finish reading Sun Yat-sen's will during meetings or memorial weeks. We were worried about his health, and the doctors repeatedly advised him to rest. However, in recent months, the military situation on the front lines has been tense, and it is very important to be in charge in the rear. His love for the party and the country ultimately outweighed his love for his own body. He carried on with his responsibilities while ill, day and night. Now that the military situation on the front lines is about to end, he will soon be able to take a short rest, but he has passed away. From now on, we will no longer be able to hear his calm footsteps in this hall, and we will no longer be able to see his gentle appearance. How memorable and painful this is. Last Friday, the State Council resolved to issue a decree for a state funeral. At the same time, we should emulate President Tan's character and work even harder to make the revolution a success as soon as possible, in order to comfort President Tan in the afterlife. The military victory on the front lines, Lanfeng has already been recovered, and Kaifeng and Zhengzhou will be captured soon. The obstacles to peace can be removed soon, and a long period of tranquility in the country can be obtained. After the military situation ends, the most important thing, of course, is to eradicate the bandits and the communists, so that the people can live and work in peace. Now there are many places where people have been displaced and the foundations of society have been shaken due to the harassment of the bandits and the communists. The government is very concerned and will definitely take responsibility to eliminate the harm and restore social order for the people. At the same time, it will concentrate all kinds of forces on construction. One is to solve the livelihood problems for the people, the second is to increase domestic wealth, and the third is to resist foreign economic aggression. In short, this is the best opportunity to reorganize the country. I have said that the transition from a country where politics is not fully on track to one where politics is clean and bright often comes after a major upheaval. Because after a major upheaval, the government wins, its prestige is established, and as long as it makes a firm decision to do it, it will naturally be twice as effective. This time, the government will eliminate the rebels such as Yan and Feng, and it is a good opportunity to resolutely and boldly carry out the things that should be promoted and reformed in the country, and progress may be made by leaps and bounds. But there is one thing that should be taken into account, that is, there are many things that should be promoted and reformed in the country, and for all things, before deciding to promote and reform and when implementing the promotion and reform, we must have a detailed observation of the overall situation of the country, so that we can prescribe the right medicine. Otherwise, a slight deviation will lead to a great error, and danger will occur. Therefore, all preparatory work is very important, and I hope everyone will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Completion of the Luokou Railway Bridge on the Jinpu Railway <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Jinan correspondence: The Luokou Yellow River Railway Bridge, which has been actively repaired by the Jinpu Railway Engineering Department, Hu Shenghong, Chen Dawo, etc., together with the Central Railway Team, and supervised the workers in recent days, was repaired at 4:00 AM this morning. At 10:30 AM, Wei Jinglu, the captain of the Central Railway Team, accompanied by Hu Shenghong, the engineer of the Jinpu Railway, Mao Qihuan, the chief of the vehicle section, etc., took a special train of the Railway Team to Luokou for inspection, and then drove across the Yellow River Bridge northward to Dezhou to investigate whether there was any damage along the way in order to repair it. It is reported that the construction of the Yellow River Railway Bridge started on the 24th and was completed today (27th), a total of only four days from start to finish, which can be said to be fast. The iron plate of one hole in the heart of the river is still moved back to the original holes on both sides, and the iron beams and iron plates transported from Yanzhou are installed in the holes in the heart of the river. Because the materials are all original, the repair is easier. However, although the bridge has been completed and can be opened to traffic, the damaged area of the first crossbeam of the tenth hole is now being filled with stones and scaffolding, which will not be completed until the evening of the 28th. Before it is completed, only small locomotives on this route can be used to pass at a speed of five miles per hour. Other types of locomotives cannot pass. Therefore, the Railway Team's special train heading north also used the No. 69 small engine of the Jinpu Station to tow it. The Railway Bureau originally intended to order the No. 326 locomotive of the armored train to go to the bridge for a test run, but later it was temporarily abandoned because it was feared that something was wrong. Chen Dawo, the engineer of the Jinpu Railway, has already sent a telegram to Chen Weixin, the commander of the Transportation Office of the Third Route Army, and Fu Jianheng, the commander of the armored car, notifying them of the completion of the repair of the Yellow River Bridge and the restrictions on the passage of locomotives. The original telegram is as follows: "The Yellow River Bridge was completed at 4 o'clock this morning and is now open to traffic. However, the damaged area of the first crossbeam of the tenth hole is now being filled with stones and scaffolding. Before the wooden frame is set up, only smaller locomotives on this route are allowed to pass at a speed of five miles per hour. Other types of locomotives will be temporarily suspended. Please check and acknowledge. The wooden frame is expected to be completed tomorrow night." It is also heard that," (27th)</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Canton Restaurant Guild's Strike Comes to an End <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Resulting from Repeated Petitions by the Restaurant Trade</p>
<p>The Provincial Government Agrees to Return the Formal Banquet Tax to the Trade for Handling</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Dispatch) Since opposing the use of a joint business license number for the formal banquet tax, the Guangzhou restaurant trade has been unanimously closed for twenty days. Although some have resumed business in recent days, they only sell tea, snacks, and noodles. Formal banquets, however, have consistently been suspended. The formal banquet merchants have petitioned the provincial government several times, but without success. The merchants initially requested: 1. That the authorities abolish the joint license requirement for the formal banquet tax to eliminate excessive levies; 2. If the joint license cannot be abolished, they requested that the formal banquet tax be managed by the restaurant trade itself. Later, although the Department of Finance approved the return of the formal banquet tax to the trade, it stipulated an annual payment of 800,000 yuan. This amount is almost double the current 400,000+ yuan paid by the tax merchants. Therefore, the merchants believed this demand was intentionally making things difficult for them, and the takeover remained unresolved. The restaurants remained closed as before. However, during the closure, thousands of workers employed by the restaurant trade suddenly lost their jobs and were unable to meet their basic needs, a truly pitiful situation. As a result, the restaurant workers jointly petitioned the provincial government, urging authorities to resolve the issue quickly to alleviate their suffering. On the morning of the 22nd, over a thousand workers, carrying small flags inscribed with "Please Government Support Unemployed Workers" and "Down with Formal Banquet Tax Racketeers," arrived at the provincial government. They then sent several representatives to request an audience with Provincial Chairman Chen Mingshu. They waited until about 2 PM when Chen returned to the government building. The workers nominated Liang Wensao, Lin Bao, Feng Heng, and He Zhen to meet with Chen, strongly stating that the restaurant trade usually employs several thousand workers. Due to the refusal to use joint licenses, the restaurants have closed in succession, indirectly causing thousands of workers to become unemployed. They pointed out that most workers have families of seven or eight, relying on their monthly wages for sustenance. Losing their jobs would leave their families destitute, forcing them to appeal to the government for a quick resolution to the restaurant trade issue, allowing the thousands of workers to once again rely on their jobs for sustenance. Chen, recognizing the workers were innocently affected, advised them to return and assured them the government would provide a solution the next day. After the representatives conveyed Chen's message, the workers, expecting good news in the morning, chose to camp outside the provincial government overnight to demonstrate their resolve. That evening, the workers prepared bedding and oil lamps, sleeping on the open ground in front of the provincial government. Businesses that had dealings with the restaurant trade sent cakes, tea, and water to feed the petitioners. The De Xuan Police Station dispatched officers to protect the scene until the next morning (the 23rd), maintaining good order. By 9 AM on the 23rd, Chen Mingshu had arrived at the provincial government. The 115th provincial meeting was scheduled for that day. After discussing various matters, Chen proposed a solution to the formal banquet tax issue. The outcome was that the use of joint licenses for the formal banquet tax should proceed as planned and the decision could not be reversed. The current annual payment of 417,000 yuan by the banquet tax merchant, would be returned to the restaurant trade with a new rate originally set at 800,000 yuan. In order to reach a compromise, the Department of Finance would reduce it by 200,000 yuan, and the restaurant trade would take it over with a payment of 610,000 yuan. Secretary Mei was then dispatched to convey this solution to the restaurant trade's representatives and the Chamber of Commerce. After seeking the opinion of everyone, the entire trade agreed to the government-approved annual payment of 610,000 yuan and take the formal banquet tax back to be handled by the restaurants. It was decided that representatives would be sent to the Department of Finance again today to discuss the specific details of the takeover. If there is progress, all city restaurants may resume operations in a day or two. (September 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e60">Xiamen Business Community Opposes the Reinstatement of Export Duties <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Telegraphing the National Government's Ministry of Finance to Revoke the Order</p>
<p>(Xiamen Dispatch) Hou Liwei, the Xiamen Customs Commissioner, requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Finance to reinstate the re-export duty on foreign goods transshipped to the interior and set October 1st as the implementation date. On the 4th of this month, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Shantou Chamber of Commerce, inquiring whether Shantou Customs levied re-export duties. They then received a reply stating that foreign goods imported through Shantou and transshipped to the interior had historically only been taxed at the time of import in Shantou, and no further taxes were levied by the common customs when transshipping to the interior. There had been no recent changes to the tax system. After receiving the reply, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of all trades in Xiamen on the 23rd to discuss the matter. They unanimously resolved to oppose the reinstatement of export duties. They also designated representatives to petition the Xiamen Customs Superintendent's Office on the 24th, urging them to forward the matter to the Ministry of Finance and revoke the order and to not implement the collection on October 1st. The Superintendent's Office agreed to forward the matter, but stated that the re-export duty was ordered by the Inspector General of Customs and the Xiamen Customs had no choice but to comply. Since businesses felt the order was difficult, they could temporarily register the taxes due pending the resolution of the case. If the Ministry of Finance agreed to abolish the duty, the payments would be waived. If the original order was maintained, the businesses would make the payments. On the 25th, the General Chamber of Commerce convened another meeting of all trades and resolved the following three items: (1) Telegraph the National Government's Ministry of Finance, urging them to instruct the authorities to prevent the implementation to safeguard commerce; (2) Unless the Ministry of Finance explicitly orders otherwise, all import and export shipments will be suspended from the deadline (food to and from the interior is exempt); (3) An anti-common customs duty on inland exports committee of Xiamen trade associations will be organized to handle all aspects of the struggle. That evening, the foreign goods import businesses telegraphed Shanghai and Hong Kong to stop shipping pending a resolution. On the 26th, the General Chamber of Commerce separately telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting the cancellation of the re-export duty. The telegram read as follows: "Respectfully to Chairman Jiang of the Nanjing National Government and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, the Xiamen Customs Commissioner Hou Liwei is not familiar with the local situation and disregards the difficulties of the merchants, changing the common customs regulations and misrepresenting the situation to his superiors, who have approved the collection of re-export duties on goods transshipped to the interior starting October 1st. Xiamen merchants believe this move hinders commerce and stifles opportunity. All Xiamen merchants have been meeting in their respective associations to discuss the issue. They all agree that common customs duties are implemented in accordance with local conditions, and there is no uniformity across regions. Xiamen is close to Shantou and both serve as transshipment hubs. In Shantou, foreign goods are taxed by the Chaozhou Customs at the time of import, and no further taxes are levied by common customs when transshipped to the interior. Xiamen's situation is the same. If Xiamen is treated differently, merchants will inevitably choose Shantou over Xiamen to reduce tax rates. If so, the future of Xiamen's commerce is dire. We all operate under the same flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun. Why does the government favor Shantou over Xiamen? Are the Xiamen merchants responsible for something, deserving of being crushed? In recent years, Xiamen has been burdened by excessive taxes. In addition to the regular duties collected by customs on imported goods, merchants must also pay various other miscellaneous taxes, making it difficult to survive. Many choose to ship goods directly from Hong Kong and Shantou to the interior, causing commerce to decline sharply in recent years. If the common customs changes its regulations again and collects re-export duties, and the interior is plagued by bandits who disregard government orders, even if merchants pay sub-port duties in Xiamen, each region in the interior will still require them to pay local likin taxes. This is like skinning the same cow multiple times and picking the same melon multiple times. It not only violates the principles of taxation but also puts Xiamen's commerce in an impossible situation, which is not the intention of our National Government to protect commerce. Furthermore, with the implementation of the new tariff schedules imminent, common customs should be abolished. Xiamen Customs should not overturn the regulations during this brief period, as the public revenue gained is minimal and it will doom Xiamen's merchants. Based on the above facts and reasons, we have unanimously and resolutely decided to resist. We earnestly request that the authorities revoke the order to collect re-export duties on goods transshipped from Xiamen. Otherwise, merchants will be left with no choice but to collectively suspend shipments and stop imports and exports. The associations believe that the merchants see the implementation of this tax as a matter of life and death and are determined to resist it at all costs. If it is implemented, it will surely cause unrest and harm both public order and commerce. We feel it is our duty to express our concerns and dare not remain silent. We respectfully request that you, our superiors, have compassion on the merchants and instruct the Xiamen Customs Commissioner not to implement the collection of re-export duties on goods transshipped to the interior to satisfy public opinion and protect commerce. We urgently submit this plea and beg for your instructions. Respectfully, Hong Hongru, Chen Ruqing, Huang Yizhu, Chairman of the Xiamen General Chamber of Commerce. (September 26th)"</p>

<p>Also to Reorganize Shipping Affairs</p>
<p>(Harbin Dispatch) Shen Honglie, Commander of the Northeast Navy, arrived in Harbin from Liaoning at 8 AM on the 21st, accompanied by Wang Shuncun, Executive Director of the Northeast Navigation Bureau. Xie Zhizhou, Commander of the River Defense Fleet, Yin Zuyin, Director of the Naval River Transportation Office, Wang Shize, Manager of the Northeast Shipping Bureau, and others welcomed him at the station. After disembarking, Shen proceeded to the Northeast Navigation Bureau. Li Siting, the marine corps commander who was once rumored to have died in the Battle of Sanjiangkou two years ago, also came with him. Shen plans to stay in Harbin for four or five days before heading to Shenyang. His mission is reportedly to inspect the Navy and to reorganize shipping affairs. At 8 AM on the 22nd, the Li Sui and Jiang Tong gunboats docked in the middle of the river at Qidaojie to await Shen's inspection. At 8:30 AM, Shen, accompanied by Fleet Commander Xie Zhizhou and others, boarded the Jiangying speedboat and first went to the Li Sui gunboat for a roll call and address, which lasted about half an hour. He then went to the Jiang Tong gunboat for an address. Afterwards, he delivered a lecture to Captain Zhang of the Li Sui and Captain Wu of the Jiang Tong. He then traveled by car to the Quanhe Barracks to inspect the sailors stationed there. He also entered the shipyard to inspect the Jiang Tai, Jiang An, and Li Jie gunboats under repair. He returned to the Navigation Bureau at about 1 PM. In the afternoon, he crossed the river to inspect the Jiangbei Shipyard and the Merchant Marine School. The Northeast United Navigation Bureau had already prepared proposals and plans to convene a general meeting of shipping merchants within two or three days to discuss the bureau's strategies and unresolved issues. It is reported that the Marine Corps may be transferred as a result of Shen's visit. (September 22nd)</p>

<p>At 9 AM today, the party, government, military, schools, and mass organizations held a conference to condemn the communists at the YMCA. Five to six hundred people attended, and many speakers from various sectors gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 11 AM. Approximately three hundred bandits suddenly appeared at Bijiaqiao in Xuancheng County a few days ago. They posted slogans, kidnapped people, and demanded ransoms. Fortunately, the 3rd Battalion Commander Feng Jinghai of the Garrison Regiment under the 6th District Bandit Suppression Headquarters, who was dispatched from Wuhu to Guangde to suppress bandits, passed through the area and surrounded the bandits. The bandits were quickly routed, with some fleeing towards Guangde. The farmers of Wanchun Township and other areas in Wuhu jointly resisted rent. The county government, acting on orders from the provincial government, has arrested Cui Qifa, who instigated the resistance. However, it has been found that farmers are still marching in groups, coercing others to resist rent. A team was dispatched to the countryside again today to investigate and make arrests. The 6th District Bandit Suppression Headquarters executed a captured bandit named Wang Gongkai at the Shisandaomen at 1 PM today. (September 28th)</p>

<p>Team Leader Du Injured in Bandit Attack: Du Jingwu, the leader of the first squad of the 14th Water Police Team in Wujiang, has been diligently suppressing bandits and has captured countless lake bandits. He recently escorted Liu Xueshi, Wang Heshang, and seven others, who were also captured by Du, to the provincial security office where they were executed last Saturday. As a result, the lake bandits have harbored deep resentment. After the death of Squadron Leader Huai Zongbang of the 14th Team recently, the district chief Gong appointed Du as the acting squadron leader of the 14th Team. On the 28th, Du received intelligence that a large gang of lake bandits had been spotted in the Miaogang area. He immediately led three patrol boats from his first squad and three patrol boats from the second squad to search and suppress them, but they encountered nothing. After returning, he stayed overnight at the first squad headquarters outside the north gate of Wujiang. However, at 2:30 AM yesterday (the 28th), seventy to eighty lake bandits from Haizhou and Henan suddenly arrived on eight boats from Taihu Lake and the canal. After landing, they surrounded the squad headquarters and attacked, vowing revenge. As a result, Team Leader Du was shot three times in his right lower leg, shattering the bone. A bullet also passed through the left side of his face. Afterwards, County Magistrate Wu Jia of Wujiang hired a steamboat to send him to the Suzhou Tianci and Boxi Hospitals for treatment. Because Du himself is unable to speak, details about the damage to the weaponry of the squad headquarters are temporarily difficult to obtain.</p>

<p>Mother and Son Both Die After Failed Speculation: Dong Xiangfu, originally from Xugongqiao West Village in the third district, opened the Dachengde flower rice store in Minhang and also independently established the Xiangji Grain Box store on Baoshan Street in Shanghai. His family mostly resides in Shanghai, with only his elderly mother and a maid in the countryside. Dong learned of his mother's illness in early August and returned home. Before leaving, he instructed a friend, Jia, to purchase ten cartloads of wheat futures (500 dan per cart) at the exchange and made arrangements with a Qianzhuang (money shop) to pay the margin. Unexpectedly, Jia predicted that the price of wheat would rise and doubled the purchase without informing Dong. Currently, the market has fallen, resulting in significant losses. A few days ago, the Qianzhuang sent a clerk to the countryside to demand payment from Dong. Only then did Dong learn the full story. At that time, Dong's mother's illness had slightly improved, but she was greatly shocked and fearful upon hearing that her son had lost a large sum of money, causing her condition to worsen again. The next morning, she passed away. Dong, grieving greatly for his mother's death, suffered a recurrence of his old liver and stomach ailment and died eight hours later, following his mother to the underworld. Those who heard of this were saddened.</p>

<p>Difficulties in Converting Field Tax from Taels to Yuan: The province has ordered the conversion of field tax from taels to yuan in the county and instructed the county to implement it. The county finance bureau has sent personnel to Kunshan to investigate, but that county has no specific measures either. Furthermore, this county has more than 430,000 households paying the grain tax, and the taxation rules of the old Jiangzhen areas are different. The procedures for verification and registration are cumbersome, so it is impossible to handle them in time for the busy tax season. A request has now been submitted to the Department of Finance for approval to postpone the implementation.</p>

<p>Construction Committee Plans to Build Large Gaoqiao Power Plant: In order to develop the domestic electrical industry, the Construction Committee of the National Government plans to build a large power plant near Gaoqiao outside the north gate of the county. A surveying team from the Taihu Water Conservancy Committee was dispatched by the committee a week ago to Wuxi to conduct precise surveys. As of the day before yesterday, the surveying team had completed all the surveying work. Once the construction plan is drawn up, land will be acquired, requiring about forty to fifty mu. The construction cost is estimated at two million yuan. The Construction Committee had previously submitted a request to the National Government to allocate forty million yuan from the returned Boxer Indemnity funds to develop the electrical industry and construct water conservancy projects nationwide. The funds required to build the power plant are planned to be drawn from this allocation. At the same time, the Ministry of Railways also plans to add a small station between Wuxi and Shitangwan. Upon hearing this news, the Construction Committee wrote to the Ministry of Railways requesting that the small station between Shitangwan be located at Gaoqiao to facilitate the transportation of coal after the Gaoqiao power plant is built. The Ministry of Railways then instructed Liu Weichi, Director of the Jinghu Railway Bureau, to send personnel to Wuxi to conduct a survey in conjunction with Wu Yulin, Director of the Qishuyan Power Plant, and it has been decided to build the station at Gaoqiao.</p>
<p>Theft and Injury in Qingsong Township: Zhang Shiheng (also known as Ren Gen), a resident of Qingsong Township near Zhang Jingqiao in the seventh district (Huai Shangshi) of the county, works as a farmer. At about 1 AM the night before last, seven or eight bandits wearing white cloths on their heads and carrying guns and wooden sticks broke open the front door and entered. They immediately tied up Shiheng and his eldest son, A-Zi, with ropes and beat them severely with the backs of knives and wooden sticks, causing both father and son to be covered in injuries. The bandits then ransacked the house, searching at will. After an hour, they left with their loot. Upon inspection, it was found that they had stolen 141 yuan in silver dollars, 70 yuan in banknotes, three gold rings, a pair of gold bracelets, and clothing, worth about 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Large Number of Refugees Disturb Fengxiang: At about 10:30 AM yesterday (September 29th), more than 400 refugees, men, women, old, and young, from Changsha, Hunan, suddenly arrived at Fengxiang in the fourth district (Kaiyuan Township) of the county. The refugee leaders, Hu Huicun and Zheng Huanzhang, dispatched five or six refugees to the ninth branch of the public security bureau, requesting food and other supplies. Liu, the chief of the branch bureau, granted their request. However, a group of refugees began to cause disturbances at the home of Feng Zhaoqiu, a resident of the alley. After the villagers reported this to the township office, the office reported it to the county government. County Magistrate Pan, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Wang Weili, the commander of the police brigade, to dispatch armed soldiers to suppress the disturbance. Only then did the refugees stop causing further trouble.</p>
<p>Urgency in Constructing the Ring-Lake Road: Previously, the Jiangsu Provincial Government considered that Taihu Lake, spanning three provinces (Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui), has long been a haven for bandits. Even though government police actively suppressed them, it was only a temporary measure and failed to fundamentally eliminate the problem. It was decided at a provincial government meeting to start with construction and build a ring-lake road. The Department of Construction was to draw up a plan for the entire route, starting from Yixing, connecting to the Ninghang Road, passing through Wujin, Wuxi, Wuxian, and Pingwang in Wujiang, and reaching Nanxun in Zhejiang. The Department of Construction has dispatched Sun Baoqin, the leader of the surveying team of the Provincial Highway Bureau, to conduct the survey. It was decided to start the survey in Wuxi. Sun has arrived in Wuxi and is working actively with six surveyors and more than twenty laborers. They started with Yuantouzhu in Kaiyuan Township, Southern Spring and Xin'an in Kaihua, and Nanwangting in Wuxian County, then to Wangting, Jinshu, Guangfu, and Mudu, and finally to Suzhou, a total of over 140 kilometers. The entire survey has been completed. The team has traveled to Suzhou to continue the survey. The total cost of the entire ring-lake road project is estimated at 1.975 million yuan and has been allocated from the 7 million yuan construction bonds recently issued by the Jiangsu province.</p>
<p>Striving to Retain Grain Tax for Local Expenses: This year's winter grain tax has been ordered to be increased by two yuan.

<p>The Agricultural Bank's Funding Fell Short of the Quota, Making it Difficult to Follow Established Precedent: The County Rectification Committee Previously Submitted to the Provincial Rectification Committee, Citing the Precedent of Wuxi, to Raise 100,000 Yuan for Loans to Farmers. The Provincial Rectification Committee Approved a Reply from the Provincial Government's Letter Approving the Agricultural and Mining Bureau. According to the Agricultural Bank's Reply, Wuxi's Submitted Agricultural Bank Funding had Exceeded 60%, So the Bank established a Branch there, and agricultural loans are handled by the branch. The head office has not made large loans, so it is unknown what Jiangyin Party Rectification Committee based its statement on. As of recently, Jiangyin had only submitted over 46,000 Yuan, which is below the standard for establishing a branch. Once the submitted funding reaches the quota, a branch can be established, and all loans can be implemented, so it is said.</p>
<p>Difficult to Donate Funds Due to Counter-Revolutionary Case: Former Municipal Administrative Bureau Chief Ji Hehua was arrested and detained due to counter-revolutionary relations. His father, Ji Ziqing, tried every means to rescue him and was willing to donate 3,000 Yuan to purchase guns for the Self-Defense Corps. His submitted document requesting this was met with the response that his son, Ji Hehua, had been arrested on suspicion of banditry, and if the investigation found counter-revolutionary facts, he would be subject to legal sanctions and would not be easily let off. If the investigation found no connection, he would be exempt from prosecution and released, without needing your donation to supplement military equipment. Await the government's investigation and handle it according to law. Bandits Rob Self-Defense Corps Firearms: Banditry in the west of the county had subsided slightly after two large-scale searches and suppressions by the Chengwu Joint Defense Military Police.

<p>Li Mingyang Reports on Suppressing Communists and Bandits: In the past year, the counties of Tong, Ru, Hai, Tai, and Jing in northern Jiangsu Province have become havens for communists and bandits, causing great harm. On the 10th of this month, Security Director Li Mingyang, led the security regiment from the province to Taixing Huangqiao to supervise the suppression. As of the 27th, the suppression was implemented. On the 28th, he and Secretary Feng Peisan came to Tong. At 1:00 PM, people from all walks of life held a welcome meeting at the club. Mr. Li reported on the suppression of communists and bandits in Tongtai, stating that the bandit suppression plan was decided at the Tongtai Six County Defense and Suppression Conference on August 20th. Since the main gathering place of communists and bandits was in Taixing, they started with Tai first. The Tongtai area is near the river with many branches, making it easy for bandits to appear and disappear. Moreover, the counties had not experienced war for decades or centuries, and the people had no self-defense organizations. When an incident happened suddenly, it quickly spread like wildfire. The Communist Party colluded with bandits. The bandit pseudo-command headquarters in Huangqiao had a military commission and a violent commission, and their only tactic was to coerce farmers and workers. Their slogan was "roll people." In the Huangqiao battle a few days ago, the bandit crowd was said to be 10,000, but only 600 or so had guns. They collapsed after attacking for more than ten minutes. He immediately implemented both suppression and appeasement. Those who were coerced surrendered their weapons and surrendered. The Communist Party knew it was difficult to gain a foothold and fled. Bandits were resolved within ten days by Li Jigen, who surrendered, recruited more than 3,000 bandits. The territory of Tongtai was immediately pacified. In the future, local self-defense strength needs to be supplemented and a fundamental solution sought. Director Li went to suppress Ma Yuren's troops along the coastal area of Yancheng, which were unusually rampant, on the 29th with the 3rd Security Regiment.</p>

Last night (the 24th), the town office clerks of the town found out and reported it to the town office, and the town office reported it to the county government. So Xia also asked the county government for an examination. Now the front and back of Xia's house have been guarded by police. This matter has caused a sensation throughout the city, and people are flocking to see it. As of the time the reporter was writing, there were no results from the examination. It is said that the deceased was pregnant and was due this month. Because she could not bear the abuse of the main wife, she committed suicide in anger. Now the neighbors will also present it to the county government for examination to clarify the matter.</p>

<p>Two Bandits Captured in the Case of the Li Family Father and Son Burned to Death: During May of this year, more than a dozen bandits came to the house of Li Tingyao, a farmer in the ninth district of this county, and robbed clothes, jewelry, and silver dollars worth more than 1,000 yuan, and subjected him to torture, burning an iron pot red and tying Tingyao and his son to the pot to burn them to death. Later, Li Enming, Tingyao's nephew, reported the case to the county government, which sent personnel to verify that it was true. A few days ago, Zhu Dafu, a detective from the Second Police Squad, obtained clues and led a team to arrest the bandits Dong Xiaobazi and Wang Tinglu, as well as the suspect Peng Xiaowuzi, and escorted them to the city. Due to insufficient precautions, Dong Xiaobazi took the opportunity to jump into the river and escaped midway. Only the two bandits Wang and Peng were escorted to the county government yesterday (26th). Hu Cheng, the trial judge, opened the court for trial. According to Wang Tinglu's confession, he confessed to robbing Li's house with Dong Xiaobazi. However, Peng Xiaowuzi refused to admit it.

<p>Thorough Investigation of Embezzlement of Construction Funds: The construction funds of Jiangsu Province are very large, and they are mostly mixed up between the Finance and Construction Bureaus. Recently, the director of the Jurong County Construction Bureau reported to Director Sun Hongji of the Construction Bureau that the county Finance Bureau had reduced the amount of funds allocated to the bureau. He also said that a lot of the county's construction funds had been embezzled. After receiving the report, Director Sun sent Liu Gonghe, an inspector from the bureau, to conduct a thorough investigation. Liu discovered that Zhou Shoulin, the director of the Jurong Finance Bureau, had embezzled funds twice, totaling more than 7,000 yuan. He took the documents back to the bureau and reported to Director Sun, who was very angry. He proposed at the provincial government meeting to dismiss Zhou as director and put him under surveillance. The Finance Bureau would send personnel to jointly re-investigate. If there were no differences, he would send personnel to take over the duties of the Jurong Finance Bureau and order former Director Zhou to hand over more than 2,000 yuan in water conservancy funds to the Construction Bureau, and other funds would be handled separately when the old and new directors handed over their duties. Director Sun was afraid that similar incidents might occur in other counties, so he sent personnel to various counties to investigate and found that a total of 350,000 yuan had been embezzled. Since it was related to construction, he drafted a five-part form for approval and implementation to prevent further embezzlement and fraud.</p>

<p>Location: Zhongleng New Village, Zhenjiang</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Preparatory Office for United Compulsory Education has established an experimental zone for popular education (Zhongleng New Village, Zhenjiang). The main crops in the area are rice and wheat, but due to poor varieties and poor planting methods, the results are declining. The office is now responsible for guiding agricultural improvement and education. It has now signed a contract with Lu Yueting, a resident of the area, to conduct a cooperative agricultural experiment field. The method is to divide the farmland into two equal areas, A and B. Area A is still cultivated freely by the owner, and Area B is also cultivated by the owner, but the planting method must be guided by the experimental zone and cannot be changed without authorization. The taxes to be paid each year for the guided area will be borne by the experimental zone, and the products will belong to the owner to compensate for the extra labor. If the harvest in Area B is less than Area A, the experimental zone will compensate for the difference. The seeds and fertilizers used will be introduced by the Popular Education Experimental Zone. The experimental methods, such as labor, seeds, fertilizers, and crop growth and harvest, will be recorded using scientific methods on a regular basis for verification. With this method, the owners can have no unexpected losses, and the area can obtain the convenience of the experiment with very little expense. If rural primary schools in various places can follow this method, the future of agriculture will inevitably improve universally, and people's livelihood education will be easier to start.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Guanlan Compulsory Education Experimental Zone Plan <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Baoshan Education Sector specially established the Guanlan Compulsory Education Experimental Zone to commemorate Yuan Guanlan. It was announced at the memorial service the day before yesterday. The plan is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Location: Mr. Yuan dedicated his life to education, and all his achievements need no further description. However, he especially promoted compulsory education and devoted the most energy to it. Fulfilling Mr. Yuan's unfinished ambition is the responsibility of those who died later. This is why Mr. Jiang Wenyu and others advocated holding the Guantan Compulsory Education Experimental Zone as a spiritual memorial. Mr. Yuan grew up in Baoyi. Baoyi formerly had two townships, Yuepu and Liuhang. The educational foundation is better than other cities and villages. Five years ago, the public proposed to designate the Zhenxin and Juquan schools in the two townships as model schools and provided funds to enrich the content in order to lay the foundation for promoting compulsory education. Although education in the two townships has been promoted every year, it has not reached the goal of universal education due to limited financial resources. Compared with the two townships, Liuhang is more convenient for transportation, has a smaller area, and has fewer students, making it easier to start promoting compulsory education. Therefore, the former Liuhang Township was selected as the Guanlan Compulsory Education Experimental Zone. (2) Number of existing schools in Liuhang Township: There are 10 schools in Liuhang Township. The distance between each school is mostly within three miles, and rarely outside three miles. In the future, the promotion only needs to add grades to the existing schools, without having to set up more schools. (3) Number of students in Liuhang Township: According to the report of the Baoshan County Education Bureau in the 18th year, the total number of students in Liuhang Township is more than 2,100, and the number of students who have not attended school is more than 1,450. (4) The distribution of existing schools and children who have not attended school in Liuhang is shown in the left picture (omitted). Explanation 1: Assuming that each level of promotion accommodates 50 students, then to achieve universal education in the whole township, about 30 levels need to be promoted. 1. According to the standard of additional class funding stipulated by the Baoshan County Education Bureau, the start-up cost for each level is 150 yuan and the regular cost is 316 yuan. Then, to add 30 levels, the start-up cost is about 4,500 yuan and the regular cost is 9,500 yuan. It is not easy to seek universal education in the whole township without raising a fund of 100,000 yuan. (5) Implementation steps: The steps to promote compulsory education must be based on economic talents, so the scope of the experimental area should not be too large in the initial stage, otherwise it will not be easy to maintain if it is not economical, that is, the talent is not enough to allocate. It is now assumed that there are two implementation steps with a fund of 30,000 yuan and 50,000 yuan. With the fund of 30,000 yuan, the interest of about 3,000 yuan can be obtained. According to the above-mentioned standard of additional class funding, about 10 levels can be promoted, accommodating 500 students. The experimental area is located in the 7th District near the Juquan Central Primary School because of its convenient transportation, and the Juquan School is the central agency for research and guidance. It is planned to promote it in two steps, as shown on the left (with a map of the experimental area) (omitted). Supplementary explanation: Every poor child in the countryside cannot attend school all day because of subsidies for family homework. If four-tenths of the funds can be used to set up half-day classes, in addition to setting up six full-day classes, eight half-day classes can be obtained, increasing by four classes, and accommodating 200 more students. First, the 25th District (69 students) and the 12th District (161 students) will be drawn into the experimental area, as shown in the attached figure (omitted). Yi Fund 50,000 yuan, an annual interest of approximately 5,000 yuan can be obtained, which can promote 16 levels and accommodate approximately 800 students. The experimental area is also centered on the Juquan Central Primary School, and it is planned to promote it in three steps, as shown in the table on the left (omitted). Supplementary explanation: If four-tenths of the funds can be used to set up half-day classes, then in addition to the ten full-day classes, twelve half-day classes can be obtained, an increase of six classes, and 300 more students can be accommodated. The 12th District (161 students), the 11th District of Dongtian (73 students), and the 47th District (113 students) will be drawn into the experimental area. The attached figure is as follows (omitted). Promoting compulsory education is not only about expanding the quantity, but also about improving the quality. In the future, there should be a considerable organization for research and guidance on the implementation. The plan will be determined separately.</p>
<h3 id="e86">National Sports Federation Registration Issue <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Director Wang Zhengting Goes to Beijing to Explain</p>
<p>The China National Amateur Athletic Federation previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Interior of the National Government for registration, but it has not yet been approved. Meanwhile, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education has issued several directives urging the National Sports Federation to register with the bureau first. The federation ignored these directives. The Bureau of Education then requested instructions from the Ministry of Education as to whether the federation should register with the Bureau of Education first. The Ministry of Education instructed the bureau, stating, "The submitted documents and attachments have been reviewed. Article 1 of the 'Measures for Educational Administrative Organs to Manage Academic Groups' stipulates that an academic group, in addition to complying with the General Principles of the Civil Code and other laws and regulations, shall handle matters in accordance with these measures." Furthermore, Item 7 of Section 3 of the revised 'Organizational Plan for People's Groups' stipulates, "Social groups with special legal provisions shall comply with the provisions of special laws." Since the China National Amateur Athletic Federation is an academic group in nature, it should, in addition to fulfilling other required procedures, submit a registration application to the bureau in accordance with the 'Measures for Educational Administrative Organs to Manage Academic Groups.' The request to forward a consultation to the Ministry of Interior for clarification should not be considered." The National Sports Federation held a meeting of its executive directors on the evening of the 28th at the Tao Le Chun Restaurant on San Ma Road. Those present included Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting and Zhao Jinqing. Regarding the federation's registration issue, Foreign Minister Wang stated that it should not register with the Bureau of Education, saying, "The Bureau of Education is responsible for all matters related to 'education,' while the National Sports Federation is outside the scope of 'education' and is an organization that enables those who have received education to engage in technical competitions based on their usual training." Foreign Minister Wang has now taken the Bureau of Education's directive to Nanjing to explain everything directly to the Ministry of Interior.</p>

<p>At this year's International Soil Congress held in Moscow, Russia, our country did not attend due to various reasons, but only sent reports and other materials. It is now learned that the congress has elected our country's member Tie Mingde as an honorary member, because his published research on soil ultrafine particles is extremely valuable.</p>
<p>It is said that Tie is a native of Shanghai, studied soil science in the United States, and served as a soil science technician at the Oregon State Experiment Station in the United States, a technician at the Guangxi Agricultural Bureau, and a section chief at the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining Inspection Institute. His research on ultrafine particles began when he was in Oregon. After returning to China, he revised and referenced his findings multiple times before publishing them.</p>

<p>Zhuang Zhihuan, Director of the Telegraph Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, gave a speech at the Telegraph School yesterday morning. All students attended the lecture. After a speech by Principal Wang Yuxiang, Director Zhuang began his speech, stating that in recent years, the telegraph industry has been affected by the political situation, and the economic situation is increasingly bankrupt. The deficit between income and expenditure last year reached more than 5.6 million yuan, so there are no funds to replace new machines or repair lines. The authorities are witnessing the difficult times, so they are reducing political expenses and striving to maintain the original state, so that the telegraph can become commercialized. He hopes that everyone will understand the overall situation of the country and the world, concentrate on learning, and take responsibility for rectifying the telegraph in the future, so that there will be endless prospects.</p>

<p>The China National Amateur Athletic Federation, in view of the fact that Japan and the Philippines are both members of the International Swimming Federation, but China has not yet participated, is concerned that problems may arise when competing in swimming at the Far Eastern Games in the future.

<h3 id="e97">Lehua Team This Season <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Still a Question of Joining the Westerners' Football Club, Expected to Return to Shanghai Today or October 2nd</p>
<p>The China Expeditionary Football Team organized by the Lehua Sports Association, due to procedural errors, failed to fulfill its ambitions and its grand plan was suspended. It returned to the country by ship from Singapore on the 20th of this month and is expected to arrive in port today. There is also an unconfirmed report that it will arrive on October 2nd. The biggest problem after the team's arrival is whether the team can still participate in various competitions of the Westerners' Football Club. The Westerners' Club has only given the word "provisional" to Lehua's application to join Group A. This word has a deep meaning. According to those familiar with the inside story, if Lehua can submit its experience and financial situation to a formal organization, such as the China Sports Federation, and obtain its review and approval, then the Westerners' Football Club can remove the word "provisional" and the Lehua Football Team can still compete with the Chinese and Western teams at sea. However, the Jinan players in the Lehua team will all work hard for their alma mater, because the team is also one of the Group A teams of the Westerners' Club, and the strength of the entire team will inevitably be affected.</p>

<p>Miss's Heart Lingers</p>
<p>Reported As Gratitude</p>
<p>Ms. Sun Guiyun, a nationally famous female sprinter, recently nearly drowned while practicing swimming. She was rescued by a student from Northeastern University and did not end up being buried in the belly of a fish. Ms. Sun was so grateful that she felt she could not repay the kindness even by working like a horse, so she vowed to repay with her body. This issue, which has always been of concern, has been resolved. Those who admired Ms. Sun very much at the National Games in Hangzhou in the past are all surprised. After the closing of the 9th Far Eastern Games, Ms. Sun returned to Harbin from Japan. Having been stimulated, she was determined to practice hard and aspired to be an all-around athlete in all sports. Ms. Sun is very interested in swimming and practices very hard. One day, while practicing swimming in a newly built swimming pool in a park, she was careless and was in danger of joining the water gods. While struggling, she shouted for help. Mr. Xu, a student from Northeastern University, heard the call, found her, and rescued her at the risk of his own life. She was lucky to escape. The two developed feelings for each other, which was the beginning. Later, after spending a long time together, they became even closer. Sun was promised to marry, hoping to spend a happy life together. It is said that Ms. Sun's wedding is scheduled for the spring. Mrs. Yu Fengzhi, the wife of Zhang Xueliang, is quite friendly with Sun. When Sun holds her wedding ceremony in the future, she will invite Commander Zhang Xueliang to be the officiant.</p>

<p>Mr. Fernand van der Straeten and his wife, a leader of the Second International and former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belgium, arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday on the Nagasaki Maru from Kobe, Japan. Representatives from various organizations welcomed them at the Wharf. Mr. Van der Straeten is a leader of the Belgian Socialist Party and a man of vast learning. At the invitation of the Academia Sinica, he is visiting China for travel and lecturing. He arrived in Beijing and Tianjin earlier this month and then went to Japan for sightseeing, where he was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life. Details are as follows:</p>

After the Nagasaki Maru docked, the welcoming personnel boarded the ship one after another and shook hands with Mr. and Mrs. Van der Straeten. Then, Zhu Shaoping, Nong Ruhui, and others escorted the couple directly to their residence at the Sino-Western Sanatorium for rest.</p>
<p>Mr. Van der Straeten's Remarks</p>
<p>Although weary from the journey and advanced in years, Mr. Van der Straeten was still very energetic. He smiled and mingled with Chinese and foreign journalists on board, showing no signs of fatigue. He also spoke English very fluently, although he suffered from some hearing loss. When asked about his stay in Shanghai and his future travel plans, he replied that he could not provide any information as he had not yet consulted with the relevant parties. When Japanese journalists asked about his impressions of his visits to Tokyo, Osaka, Kobe, and other places in Japan, he gestured frequently to express his admiration, saying that the rapid and great material progress of their country was truly admirable. Finally, when asked how old he was, he replied sixty-three.</p>
<p>Hosting Journalists</p>
<p>Mr. Van der Straeten is scheduled to host Chinese and foreign journalists this morning. The Shanghai International Reception Committee notified the newspapers yesterday, saying, "Mr. Fernand van der Straeten, former Foreign Minister of Belgium and Chairman of the Second International, arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru on the 29th. A reception for Chinese and foreign journalists will be held at the Foreign Affairs Discussion Hall at 11:00 AM on Tuesday, September 30th. Your presence will be greatly appreciated. Also, tonight at 8:00 PM, various organizations will hold a public banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Van der Straeten at the Grand China Hotel."</p>
<p>Subsequent Itinerary</p>
<p>According to news from the Belgian Embassy, Mr. and Mrs. Van der Straeten are scheduled to visit Hangzhou for sightseeing on the 1st, return to Shanghai on the morning of the 4th, attend a luncheon hosted by the Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee, and attend a banquet hosted by Belgian Minister Wouters and his wife at the Cathay Hotel in the evening. On the 5th, Minister Wang Jingqi will host a luncheon, and Mr. Van der Straeten will deliver a speech at the Chamber of Commerce in the afternoon. In the evening, the Belgian Consul will host a banquet. On the 6th, the Chamber of Commerce will host a banquet in the evening. On the 7th, they will go to Beijing. It is not yet decided whether they will go to Hankou. After returning to Shanghai, they also plan to visit Hong Kong and Annam.</p>
<p>Arrival in China</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Wang Jingqi, the former Belgian Minister, yesterday. According to him, when he was about to leave his post in Belgium last year and return to China, Mr. Van der Straeten expressed to him in his personal capacity that he wished to travel to China, but as he was a scholar, he was short of funds and hoped that China could provide assistance. When he returned to China and arrived in Beijing, the Belgian Minister again conveyed this wish. He then applied to the Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Committee in his personal capacity for assistance for Mr. Van der Straeten. It was finally decided that Mr. Van der Straeten would be invited to China to lecture in the name of the Academia Sinica. Mr. Wang also said that the abolition of unequal treaties actually began in Belgium. The Sino-Belgian Commercial Treaty was signed in the fourth year of the Tongzhi reign. The treaty stipulated that if neither party proposed amendments, it could be extended for ten years. If a new treaty was not concluded, the old treaty would continue to be valid. Therefore, the treaty was repeatedly delayed for another sixty years after its expiration. In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the entire country unanimously urged the abolition of the Belgian treaty. After the vigorous negotiations of former Foreign Minister Gu Weijun and himself, Belgium finally agreed to abolish the treaty. Both parties agreed to abolish the old treaty. In terms of tariffs, Belgium would still enjoy the treatment of the most favored nation, and the abolition of Belgian consular jurisdiction in China was also agreed upon. This matter was finally concluded. Mr. Van der Straeten was the Belgian Foreign Minister at the time, so we have a lot of goodwill towards him, and so on.</p>

<p>Removal of Rice Price Limits in North Shanghai</p>
<p>Registration and Evaluation Abolished Simultaneously</p>
<p>The rice market in this city has become even more sluggish in recent days. The best Xin Geng rice has already opened below 16 yuan. The North Shanghai Office of the Rice and Bean Industry Association previously reported to the Bureau of Social Affairs that the Chen Po Geng rice was scarce and would soon disappear, while the supply of new rice was abundant, the stock was quite large, and sales were slow. Prices were falling rather than rising, and the period of panic had passed. They requested the cancellation of registration and evaluation procedures. It is reported that the Bureau of Social Affairs, having observed that the price limits had been in place for six months and finding the claims to be true, has approved the cancellation of both the price limits and the registration in North Shanghai from October 1st.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Water Company Implements Account Audit Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Until the Audit is Complete</p>
<p>Water Bills will be Paid According to Old Regulations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association is seeking a proper solution to the water price increase by the Shanghai Municipal Council Waterworks. The fifth Executive Committee specially appointed Yu Xiji, He Dekui, and Pan Xulun as representatives to go to the Water Company to inspect the accounts of previous years as a basis for determining whether or not to increase prices. Yesterday at 2:30 PM, the three representatives went to the company to audit the accounts. (Mr. Yu Xiji arrived from Beijing yesterday morning.) They were received and welcomed by the company's General Manager Paulsen, Secretary Walter, and Auditor Klingener, who showed a humble attitude and immediately submitted the accounts for the previous six months for inspection. The representatives requested to see the company's operating reports for the past fifteen years, as well as balance sheets and income statements. The company initially hesitated, but after explanations, they agreed. The representatives planned to spend a week going to the company every day for the audit. Yesterday, they audited the financial statements for the first half of this year, and today they will begin reviewing the previous accounts. The correspondence between the Ratepayers' Association and the Water Company is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Water Company's Letter to the Ratepayers' Association</p>
<p>Regarding your letter of the 25th of this month, we have learned that your association has appointed Yu Xiji, Pan Xulun, He Dekui, and three other gentlemen as representatives to review the accounts on which the proposed 25% surcharge is based. We would like to know when your representatives will arrive. The last paragraph of your letter refers to the minutes of the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting on September 17th. According to the minutes, a certain director proposed the formation of a committee to investigate whether the price increase was necessary, but this was not approved. It was only passed that your association be informed that our company's accounts can be publicly reviewed. From this point of view, the suggestion in your letter to suspend the collection of water bills by our company is not only useless but also impossible at this time. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association.</p>
<p>Ratepayers' Association's Reply to the Water Company</p>
<p>Regarding your letter of September 20th, regarding the appointment of representatives to meet with you for the audit, the representatives appointed to audit your company have scheduled to perform this task within the next week. Please take note. As for the collection of water bills, our association believes that before the audit is completed and it is determined that a price increase is warranted, your company should only charge 6%, that is, charge at the original price. If it is later determined that a price increase is warranted, the difference can be collected retroactively. The minutes of the Shanghai Municipal Council meeting on September 17th have already been reviewed. The Council's approach is indeed appropriate, as it is well aware that it is practically impossible to express fairness regarding the price increase without having your company's accounts reviewed by our association. Regarding this point, we hope your company will pay attention to it. We reply accordingly, hoping you will take note that water prices should continue to be charged at the original price before the audit is completed and it is determined that a price increase is warranted, in order to avoid disputes.</p>
<p>Ratepayers' Association's Letter to the Real Estate Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Real Estate Association yesterday, saying, "Regarding the Shanghai Waterworks Company's letter of September 27th, stating that water prices should be charged at the new price regardless of the outcome of the audit, our association immediately replied to the company, 'Regarding the collection of water bills, our association believes that before the audit is completed and it is determined that a price increase is warranted, your company should only charge 6%, that is, charge at the original price. If it is later determined that a price increase is warranted, the difference can be collected retroactively,' and so on. We inform you accordingly, hoping you will take note and immediately notify that all water bills should be paid at the old rate before the audit is completed and it is determined that a price increase is warranted.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Schools Participate in Anti-Drug Week <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Special Editions Published in National Newspapers</p>
<p>Preparations for the 7th Anti-Drug Week, which will be held from October 1st to 7th this year, have been repeatedly reported in various newspapers. All sectors of the city are actively participating. The association believes that the academic community is the backbone of society, and the anti-drug movement relies heavily on the academic community. This year's Anti-Drug Week should focus on student education. The Municipal Education Bureau has been requested to instruct all levels of schools to hold anti-drug lectures and post various propaganda materials during Anti-Drug Week to give the academic community a deep understanding of the opium problem. The letters to the Education Bureau and various schools are as follows: (1) Letter to the Education Bureau: "The 7th National Anti-Drug Movement Week this year has been scheduled for October 1st to 7th. All provinces, cities, and counties have already started preparations. Shanghai is a place of interest to both China and foreign countries, and it is an area where opium and drugs are rampant. The Anti-Drug Movement Week needs to be expanded. In order to arouse the interest of the academic community in participating in the anti-drug movement, encourage research on the opium problem, and conduct an anti-drug lecture and essay competition this year, this year's competition is already in active preparation. However, during the anti-drug cycle, the education of the academic community is the most urgent task at present. Our association has sent various pictures, slogans, propaganda outlines, etc. for this year's Anti-Drug Week to various schools, asking them to post them and hold anti-drug lectures in the schools. We hereby request your bureau to instruct all schools to handle this matter together in order to expand propaganda. The future of anti-drug is dependent on it. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. (2) Letter to the Schools: "The opium disaster in China is deeply and greatly painful. Diplomatic failures, internal affairs are not well-governed, industry is declining, and people's livelihood is difficult. Tracing the origin of the disaster, opium is the main cause of everything. Our association takes promoting the anti-drug movement as its duty, and its purpose is to urge the government to earnestly prohibit smoking, awaken the people, unanimously reject drugs, eliminate the domestic smoking disaster, and stop imported poisons, in order to save the country from danger and seek strength. However, in order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, it is impossible to succeed without expanding anti-drug education and anti-drug propaganda. Therefore, our association has the National Anti-Drug Movement Week every year, notifying comrades across the country, individuals, and sympathetic groups to carry out large-scale anti-drug movements at the same time. The 7th Anti-Drug Week this year has been scheduled for October 1st to 7th by our association. At the time when domestic smoking bans are urgently needed and the International Conference will be held soon, compared with previous years, it is even more necessary to exert all efforts to carry out a more enthusiastic and great movement. We have always admired your school for sympathizing with anti-drug and saving the country. We hereby send you pictures, short chapters, and notices, and we ask you to post them during Anti-Drug Week and hold anti-drug lectures to cultivate the concept of anti-drug among young students and contribute to the unprecedentedly great feat of this year. The future of anti-drug is very fortunate. Sincerely dedicated, respectfully wishing you well." It is also heard that for this Anti-Drug Week, in addition to the newspapers in Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang, the following newspapers across the country have published special editions: Harbin Business Gazette, Daily News, Harbin Gazette, Binjiang Times, Great Northern News, Northeast China Business News, Changchun Dadong Daily, Yimin Times, Northeast China Times, Heilongjiang Newspaper, Heihe Daily, Changsha Dagong Bao, Chongde Dazhong Daily, Hankou Zhongshan Daily, Shenyang Northeast China Gazette, Jilin Jichang Daily, Shashi Yangtze River Business News, Yichang Times, Hengzhou Xiangjiang Daily, Yichang Yishi Bao, Wuchang Hubei Gazette, Hankou News, Continental News, Wuhu Industrial and Commercial Daily, Wanjiang Daily, Ganzhou Xin Gannan Bao, Sanmin Daily, Weixin Bao, Jiujiang Republic Daily, Jiujiang Evening News, Jiangsheng Daily, Hankou Public Opinion Daily, Chongqing Business News, Nanchang Jiangxi Evening News, Lanzhou Xinlong Daily, Minhou Anti-Drug Review Report, Fuzhou Evening News, Xin Fuzhou Bao, Xinmin Bao, Public Opinion Xinbao, and dozens of other places.</p>

<h3 id="e123">The Silk Factories Still Insist on Suspending Operations to Oppose Public Weighing and Inspection <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Using Suspension of Business as a Countermeasure</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Factories Association, due to various businesses opposing public weighing and inspection, and requesting financial assistance for the silk industry from the Ministry of Finance, continued to hold a general meeting of representatives of all businesses yesterday (the 29th) at 3:00 PM. Executive committee members Zhu Jing'an, Huang Jinchen, Zhang Peishen, Wang Xiaolai, etc., and over ninety manufacturers attended. Chairman Shen Huachen presided, and after formal greetings, the first matter discussed was the opposition by cocoon merchants from Zhejiang Province to the import of Japanese cocoons. The chairman explained the reasons for the opposition from various groups. It was generally agreed that the request to reduce import duties on Japanese cocoons was from June of this year. At that time, due to insufficient domestic supply, it was proposed to purchase Japanese cocoons to make up for the shortfall. Subsequently, due to opposition from various parties, the government had already ordered customs to prohibit the import of Japanese cocoons, so the matter was a thing of the past. Moreover, silk prices had recently fallen, and Japanese cocoon prices were high, making it unprofitable for factories. Shanghai silk factories had not purchased Japanese cocoons, so the matter was no longer an issue and did not need discussion (passed). The next item was the opposition to public weighing and inspection. After Chairman Shen read aloud the full text of the reply from the Bureau of Commodity Inspection, it was generally felt that the reasons given by the bureau were far-fetched and evasive, and it was unwilling to act as an intermediary. At a time when the silk market in foreign firms was declining, and the silk industry was at a critical juncture, silk factories were closing down due to losses. The bureau still wanted factories to bear additional losses, which was truly insensitive to the difficulties of businesses. Moreover, before the previous general meeting, the public weight of silk sent by various factories to the inspection office was more than ten catties less than the net weight. Now, after the general meeting, the public weight inspected was more than ten catties greater than the net weight, and its intention was clear - to alleviate opposition. The businesses must not be fooled. Since the bureau was unwilling to cancel it, the only option was to follow the resolution of the previous meeting. If the bureau did not cancel public weighing and inspection by October 1st, operations would be suspended to fight for it. Chairman Shen suggested that if all businesses suspended operations, tens of thousands of workers would inevitably have no means of livelihood, which was a major issue for the national economy and people's livelihood. He repeatedly advised the representatives to wait for a petition to the Ministry of Finance before deciding on a course of action. However, the manufacturers present were quite indignant and insisted on implementing the resolution of the previous general meeting. Seeing the strong sentiments of the crowd, Chairman Shen was unable to dissuade them. However, for the sake of caution, he put the motion to suspend operations to a vote, and it was unanimously approved twice by standing up. In accordance with the resolution of the previous general meeting, if public weighing and inspection was not cancelled by the deadline, all silk factories in Shanghai would suspend operations together and wait (passed). Finally, the matter of submitting a petition to the government for financial assistance to the silk industry was discussed. Chairman Shen reported that he and the two standing committee members, Wang Xiaolai and Huang Jinchen, had visited Vice Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Finance to request an allocation of public bonds or the issuance of silk industry bonds worth five million yuan to provide assistance. Vice Minister Zhang agreed to discuss the matter further at a later date and would reply after another visit to Vice Minister Zhang the next day. The meeting adjourned after discussions, around 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Reduced Shipping Rates for Exports to the East Indies <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Estimated Reduction of Thirty-Five Percent</p>
<p>The Java Shipping Company in this port is gradually expanding its shipping operations in the East Indies. It has a total of three shipping routes, with two regular passenger ships to Java each month, and a non-regular cargo ship every fourteen days. The ships currently in use include the "Chikareng," "Chibadak," "Chishengda," "Chikinbong," "Chimolok," "Chisalak," "Chilibapart," and "Chisailiya," among over ten others. The largest has a capacity of 16,000 tons. To develop the export cargo business from China to the East Indies and the South Seas Islands, it has been decided to implement a reduction in the shipping rates for export cargo departing from Shanghai. The shipping rates will be reduced by sixty-five percent across the board from the original rates. In effect, the reduction is a significant thirty-five percent. The new shipping rates are being revised, and the company has already notified all parties. All goods shipped from Shanghai to Batavia, Semarang, Surabaya, Makassar, and other ports will be subject to the price reduction.</p>
<h3 id="e125">The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Investigates and Replies Regarding the Custom of Promissory Notes <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court yesterday, stating that on the 5th of this month, it received a letter requesting a detailed investigation and reply on two points regarding the custom of using promissory notes in Shanghai in connection with cases being handled. The Chamber immediately forwarded the letter to the Shanghai Money Trade Association for investigation and reply. The reply stated that the Association's members use three types of negotiable instruments: bank drafts, checks, and remittances, but there is no such thing as a "promissory note." As for whether promissory notes can be used for commercial transactions and whether the use of promissory notes can be considered as clear settlement of accounts, the customs vary among different industries, and the Association cannot speculate. At the same time, the Chamber's investigation found that the commercial custom in this city is to use bank drafts or checks for commercial transactions. Bank drafts are subject to a ten-day term as stipulated by the money trade. As for the commonly referred to "promissory notes," they are issued by businesses who temporarily lack cash in their operations, are unable to repay debts, and issue a promissory note as a last resort to indicate to the creditor their responsibility for the debt. The note specifies the period for repayment in installments to indicate the process of clearing the business. The nature of this type of note seems to be a contract between the creditor and the debtor and cannot be considered as clear settlement of accounts. Clear settlement of accounts should only occur after receiving cash or a banker's draft or bank draft from a third party. A corresponding letter is sent for your reference.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Various Associations Uphold Trade Regulations <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sausage Association and other groups believe that trade regulations are the lifeblood of the associations. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce recently reviewed the issue of trade regulations and considered them insignificant, which has a great impact on various trade associations. The associations recently sent letters to various public associations, jointly requesting the National Government to instruct the Ministry to re-examine the matter. Yesterday, the Seashore Produce and Green Goods Association replied, stating that upon receiving the letter and a copy of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's reply to the Executive Yuan, they expressed their sympathy. Since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's review and disapproval of the case where all non-member businesses should comply with the approved trade regulations was published and replied to the Executive Yuan, the morale of the associations has been weakened, and there is a great tendency to disintegrate. The fact that your esteemed Association has requested various public associations to jointly petition the National Government to instruct the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry to re-examine the matter is a matter of life and death for the association. They dare not hesitate to call for a follow-up. This case is based on the spirit of Article 2 of the promulgated Association Law, which is both justified and reasonable. They hope that your esteemed Association will continue to express its sincere and reasoned arguments with an unyielding spirit, and that the associations will jointly submit a petition to the National Government to order the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry to re-examine the matter to achieve the purpose of approval, which is truly a public benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e127">The Jianghai Customs Regularly Burns Confiscated Opium <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>October 3rd</p>
<p>During the 208th term, the Jianghai Customs seized and confiscated nine dan, twenty-one jin, eleven liang, seven qian, and five fen of opium, as well as four thousand seventy-two liang of morphine, and two thousand six dan of poppy shells. In addition, there were morphine-containing pills valued at 1,014 silver dollars. The Superintendent, Mr. Meierhe, reported to the Supervisory Office and scheduled to transport the aforementioned opium, etc., to the kiln in Pudong for burning at 9:00 AM on October 3rd. Yesterday, the Supervisory Office sent letters to the military and political organizations in this port, requesting them to send personnel to supervise the burning.</p>

<p>The Municipal Training Council Issues a Circular for Compliance</p>
<p>The Mass Training Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Department stated that the powers of the Preparatory Committee of the Federation of Industry Unions have been clearly stipulated in Article 2 of the organizational rules of each association as (A) the reorganization of the old industry unions, (B) the organization of new industry unions, (C) the registration of industry unions, and (D) other preparatory matters. The work in items A and B of this article should be submitted to the Municipal Training Council for handling according to law. The powers of the instructors of the preparatory committees of the Federation of Industry Unions have also been clearly stipulated as 1. guiding the activities of the preparatory committees of the Federation of Industry Unions, 2. participating in the meetings of the preparatory committees of the Federation of Industry Unions, 3. carrying out the orders of the Municipal Party Department and mediating labor-labor disputes with the preparatory committees of the Federation of Industry Unions, 4. examining the thoughts and actions of the staff and members or workers of the preparatory committees of the Federation of Industry Unions, and 5. handling matters temporarily designated by this committee. These have all been promulgated. However, it has recently been found that the committees often handle labor-capital disputes or labor-labor disputes of their respective industries on their own, disregarding their own responsibilities. This is inappropriate and exceeds their authority. This situation is considered to require strict correction. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the preparatory committees of the Federation of Industry Unions and the industry unions, stating that they must not handle labor-capital disputes or labor-labor disputes on their own in the future, and that the instructors of the preparatory committees of the Federation of Industry Unions must carefully provide guidance and not be negligent.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Shanghai Java Company Has Not Yet Expressed an Opinion on the Xiao Case <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>But Says That After Verification, He Will Be Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>The case of the deputy captain of the Shanghai Java Company's ship insulting Ms. Xiao has aroused resistance from various public organizations. Yesterday, the reporter went to the company to inquire whether the Dutch authorities and the shipping company had any concrete measures to express their opinion on the case. According to the person in charge of the company, after Shenbao reported the matter, the Shanghai branch had telegraphed the head office to inquire about the disposal method, but no reply had been received. He also stated that the Netherlands is a country ruled by law and attaches great importance to the law. Since such incidents have been discovered, the authorities will definitely have a way to deal with them. He recalled that several years ago, a case also occurred in Shanghai where a Dutchman serving as a police officer raped a Chinese woman. After the incident was verified, he was sent back to his country and sentenced to eight years in prison, and is still in prison. Now that the deputy captain has insulted the Chinese people in this way, once it is verified, not only will he be dismissed, but he should also be sentenced to imprisonment. Because the head office has not yet sent a telegram, the Shanghai branch is not in a position to express any opinion on this case.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees of Six Groups of Jisheng Society <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society held its fourth joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of Six Groups on September 22nd. Committee Chairman Wang Yiting, Vice-Chairmen Huang Hanzhi and Xu Qianlin, Committee Members Zhejiang Relief General Director Feng Yangshan, Pinglu Relief Director Zhou Jingfu, Shaanxi Relief Director Zhang Xianqing, Liaoning Famine Relief Representative Shan Zhongfan, Relief Worker Li Yunmen, Committee Member Qu Wenliu, Zhu Shoucheng, and over thirty other gentlemen attended. (1) Congratulations and welcome to the Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Pinglu, and other provincial famine relief directors and relief workers. The gentlemen in charge of famine relief in the provinces have endured great hardships on this trip. Their contributions are obvious, and they have gained the trust of all sectors and been entrusted with heavy responsibilities. The Society extends its warmest welcome, and the public unanimously agrees. (2) Zhejiang Relief General Director Feng Yangshan reported that he is currently handling relief work in the three districts of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in Zhejiang. In the old Taizhou district, the six counties of Linhai, Ninghai, Huangyan, Wenling, Tiantai, and Xianju have spent tens of thousands of relief funds. In the old Wenzhou district, the four counties of Yongjia, Yueqing, Yuhuan, and Rui'an have spent several tens of thousands of relief funds. In the old Ningbo district, Xiangshan has spent several tens of thousands of relief funds. The labor relief in Taizhou is huge, and the relief funds may not be sufficient. Sun Yinting is currently working hard to promote it, and we will see how it goes. Detailed accounts and evidence will be reported from each province. The unstable situation in Zhejiang and the difficulties of handling relief have been reported from time to time and will not be repeated here. (3) Shaanxi Relief Director Zhang Xianqing reported that this year Shaanxi Province is unstable and travel is extremely difficult. It was difficult to go, but General Zhu Ziqiao arranged to travel to Shaanxi by the same car. It was publicly agreed that the Wugong County Righteous Relief should be undertaken by this Society, as the county was severely affected by the disaster. This Society had previously been solely responsible for relief and assistance in order to be familiar with the work. Xianqing's trip was very dangerous. The county magistrate had been kidnapped, the troops had all withdrawn, and the bandits were no more than twenty li from the city. Further west, there were more soldiers and bandits, so he had to urgently complete the Wugong Relief and expand the disaster relief to three more shelters, providing both education and training. This Society has established a total of eight shelters in Xi'an, Xianyang, Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, and Qishan for relief. Since leaving for Shaanxi last year, he has returned to Shanghai this autumn and has handled relief work in the fourteen counties of Chang'an, Xianyang, Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, Mei County, Chaoyi, Chengcheng, Lin Yang, Baishui, Pucheng, Tongguan, and Fugu, spending several tens of thousands of relief funds. Detailed accounts and evidence are available. Xianqing has returned to raise funds due to insufficient relief funds, and will observe the situation before making further plans. The disaster in Shaanxi is a catastrophe that is difficult to alleviate in a short period of time. It is best to focus on the immigration plan, as the vast land and sparse population of Liaoning Province outside the pass can provide a livelihood. Disaster victims from Shandong and Henan can also be transferred there as appropriate. This can be discussed with General Zhu Ziqiao to send them by special train. Chairman Wang said that immigration is a good idea and can be proposed at the Relief Affairs Committee for discussion and reporting for consideration. (4) Pinglu Relief Director Zhou Jingfu reported that the emergency relief porridge factories operated in Ping Province last winter and spring have been reported previously. The urgent relief for the Jinan armory fire last month has been completed. Relief medicine has been transported to Qufu for the military disaster for initial relief, and we will plan further as the opportunity arises. (5) A committee member of the Economic Group reported that the Society's total income and expenditure accounts from February to September 22nd of this year amounted to several tens of thousands of yuan paid for relief in the provinces and counties of Shaanxi, Zhejiang, Ping, Yu, Lu, Wan, Su, and Sui. Although income and expenditure can be offset, there are still major items such as winter relief cotton clothing this year, emergency relief for the Liaoning flood, winter relief for the second half of the year, and the Tiantai bridge project, which urgently need assistance. If there is a source of funds, it would be very fortunate; otherwise, we will have to borrow several tens of thousands of yuan. I hope that charitable comrades at home and abroad will find ways to raise funds and call for great kindness. (6) Director Zhang Xianqing and other committee members proposed the Liaoning flood disaster case. The Liaoning flood disaster is very serious. Zhu Ziqiao, Yang Zigong, He Maoru, Zhang Shuzhi, Liaoning Provincial Government Chairman Zang, and other gentlemen have launched a disaster relief effort. The disaster situation is extremely serious. Please do your best to assist in the declaration of disaster relief and neighborhood assistance. A committee member said that the Society has received telegrams requesting relief from various provinces, like snowflakes, about one hundred or more, and there is no way to deal with them. We have to put them aside and choose the important ones to handle. The Society has established two porridge factories in Suizhong, Liaoning, for winter relief cotton clothing, and we still need to raise more funds for continued operation. Everyone, please pay attention. There was no objection from the public. (7) A committee member proposed that now that the great calamity has befallen, no province is without disaster, and no place is without disaster. The relief work carried out by the Society is only one in a thousand. The Society has exhausted its strength, and the rest is beyond its reach. At this time, it is the time for the Society's colleagues to do good deeds, with no retreat and only advancement, which is their duty. I urge my comrades to be kind and compassionate, to increase unity, to enable people from all walks of life to rise up, develop the Society's affairs, overcome difficulties together, and pray for the same blessings. The public unanimously agreed, and the meeting adjourned after the bell rang.</p>

<p>It Turns Out to Be a Bigamy Drama</p>
<p>The First Wife, Upon Hearing the News, How Can She Bear It?</p>
<p>Guests, Disappointed, Disperse</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Court Ordered Bail</p>
<p>Sipping Tea and Enjoying Music Leads to Intimacy: Zhang Rongfa, an Investigator from the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol, has a daughter named Huifen, also known as Gendi, born in March of the Jia Yin year. Zhang cherishes her like a pearl. When she grows up, he sends her to the Western District Primary School attached to Nanyang Middle School. She is quite intelligent. But she is not yet betrothed. The Zhang family lives outside the Rihui Bridge on Longhua Road and runs the Danfeng Teahouse at home, hiring performers of Su Tan opera to perform every night to attract customers. Zhang Shirong, the owner of the Zhang Bingji tobacco and paper shop in the Xizhalan area of Gaochang Temple nearby, is only twenty-four years old. He regularly visits the Danfeng Teahouse at night to sip tea and enjoy the music. Over time, he becomes intimate with Huifen. She understands romantic feelings. Zhang seduces her and she falls into his trap.</p>
<p>Over Time, They Emulate Hongfu and Eloped: Rongfa sees his beloved daughter whispering sweet nothings with Shirong in public, believing it is not something a daughter should do. He tries to admonish her, but the daughter not only does not listen but also thinks her parents are not understanding enough. In this era of open socializing, children's marriages should have absolute freedom, and no one else should interfere. So she argues with her parents. Rongfa tightens his precautions. Huifen cannot bear it and on the nineteenth day of the old fifth month, emulates Hongfu and elopes with Shirong, temporarily staying at the Nanjing Hotel on Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession.</p>
<p>He Has a Wife at Home for Three Years Without Children: Shirong is already married to a woman from the Yang family. They married on September 19th of the sixteenth year and have been married for three years. The Yang woman is a week older than Shirong. Upon hearing that her husband has a romantic affair with another family's daughter, she has repeatedly tried to dissuade him, but Shirong retorts that he has been married to her for three years without any children, leaving the Yang woman helpless. Since his beloved daughter left home, Rongfa knew that she was living with Shirong, but for the sake of his reputation, he tolerated it and did not publicize it. Friends and relatives who knew about it mostly advised him to help them get together. Shirong also thought that what's done is done, so he agreed to Huifen marrying him, but insisted on having a matchmaker to save face.</p>
<p>Choosing an Auspicious Day for the Wedding, Jubilant Atmosphere: Shirong, seeing that his goal has been achieved, immediately hired Chen Yinsheng and Xu Jingqing as matchmakers. They chose the auspicious date of September 27th at 8:00 PM to hold the wedding ceremony. The auditorium was at the Hongqing Restaurant at the intersection of Hubei Road and Guangdong Road. They sent out invitations. Last Saturday, the auspicious day arrived. Both families' friends and relatives went to the Hongqing Restaurant to decorate the auditorium, making it extremely luxurious. As dusk approached, red candles were lit in front of the hall, drums and music filled the air outside, and guests arrived in droves, creating a bustling scene. The groom was dressed in a Western suit, with a fresh flower pinned to his lapel, his face beaming with joy. The bride was also wearing a grand wedding gown, making her even more beautiful.</p>
<p>Police Detectives Arrive Suddenly: Just as the male and female attendants were about to invite the couple to the auditorium, Detectives Zhang Liang and Wang Yingjie from the Old Gate Police Station, along with lawyer Zhu Shuzhen, arrived leisurely. The guests were surprised that the groom had such wide connections, even attracting lawyers and detectives to offer their congratulations.</p>
<p>The Bride and Groom Are Arrested Together: Unexpectedly, a young woman followed the lawyer and detectives. The woman's eyebrows were raised, and her anger was evident. She hurried to the auditorium and reported to the detectives that the groom was her husband. The detectives then arrested the bride and groom together. The guests, witnessing this, realized that Shirong had been accused of bigamy by his first wife. The detectives were ordered to arrest him at this time. They all scattered like frightened birds and animals. It was truly a buzzkill. The wedding certificate and guest book on the table were all taken to the police station and placed in separate custody.</p>
<p>The Police Prosecuted Based on Criminal Law: Yesterday morning, this couple was taken to the Special District Court for trial. Huifen had removed her grand wedding gown and changed into a pink qipao, silk stockings, and leather shoes. Shirong was still in his Western suit. However, because there was not enough time for interrogation in the morning, it was postponed to 2:30 PM. Presiding Judge Zhou interrogated them. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that he was prosecuting based on Article 254 of the Criminal Law and requested an investigation. Shirong's first wife, Yang, stated that her husband had found a new love and abandoned his legitimate wife. Only on Saturday morning did she learn that they were formally getting married, so she entrusted Lawyer Zhu to report to the police station to make the arrest.</p>
<p>The Man Says He Is a Dual Heir, the Woman Willing to Be a Concubine: Under questioning, Zhang Shirong confessed that he had been married to Yang for three years without children. He was the dual heir of his uncle, Zhang Bingkun. After he met Huifen, his uncle advocated for him to marry her. Zhang Huifen confessed that she knew that Shirong already had a wife, but she was voluntarily marrying him and was willing to be a concubine.</p>
<p>Both Were Released on Bail, Rescheduled for Another Hearing: The defendants' lawyers requested a postponement so that both parties could settle out of court. However, the police lawyer expressed strong disapproval of a private settlement, stating that this was a public prosecution and could not be arbitrarily dismissed. Presiding Judge Zhou then ordered both defendants to post 500 yuan bail each and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e136">A Major Gambling Den Busted in the Russian Relief Association <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>No Chinese People Inside</p>
<p>British, Japanese, and Portuguese Citizens Claimed by Consulates</p>
<p>Russian Gamblers Allowed to Post Bail</p>
<p>Five Employees Released on Bail Pending Trial</p>
<p>The Russian Disabled Veterans Relief Association at 172 Route Ghisi was warned by the Hongkou Police Station for allowing people to gamble. However, the association's leaders ignored the warnings and continued to hold gambling sessions every night. Last Saturday (the 27th) at midnight, Lin, the Western Head of the Hongkou Police Station, and Smith, the Western Detective Chief, visited the association for investigation. At the time, people upstairs and downstairs were gambling loudly. The gambling method involved placing a box-shaped object on a table, with one person in charge of rotating the mechanism. When the mechanism rotated, a ball would fall out of the box, with numbers on it. A blackboard was also hung on the wall, with numbers written on it. Gamblers could choose a number and bet on it. If the number they bet on matched the number on the ball, they would win. When the ball was shaken out, one person would shout out the number, and another would verify the number. The organization was quite organized. Besides this gambling method, there were other gambling tools, but they were not popular with the Chinese. So that night, all the gamblers were foreigners. A total of 58 people were arrested upstairs, along with various gambling tools and chips, and taken to the police station for questioning. Among them were 19 Japanese, 5 British, and 1 Portuguese woman. That night, they were handed over to the consulates of Japan, Britain, and Portugal for investigation. The remaining 33 were all of Russian nationality. Russia had no consular jurisdiction, so they were subject to the Special District Court. The police chief arrested five of them: Foshilin, Temilifu, Yier Ying, Ximing, and Shakao Kaofu. The other 28 were all gamblers and were allowed to be released on bail of 30 yuan each. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer, Li Zhishan, filed a lawsuit with the Special Court's Local Court, accusing the former five of violating Articles 279 and 280 of the Criminal Law for running a gambling den, and the latter of violating Article 278 of the Criminal Law for gambling. Presiding Judge Feng interrogated them. According to the report of Police Chief Lin, Foshi Lin was the clerk of the gambling den, Temi and Yi were in charge of shaking the gambling tools in the gambling den downstairs, and Xi and Sha were the receptionists of the gambling den. When they entered the venue, Temi was shaking the gambling tools and announcing the numbers, Yi was checking the numbers, and Sha was issuing chips in the gambling den upstairs. The gambling table upstairs was green, and more than 20 gamblers were there. The gambling den's profit was 10% of the winnings. The police had heard about it for a long time, but because the details were unclear, they sent undercover gamblers to investigate and find out the details before making the arrest the night before. The gambling tools and gambling books were also presented. The five defendants, Foshi Lin, etc., hired lawyers to defend them and requested bail. Presiding Judge Feng approved the five defendants to post 1,000 yuan cash bail each, and the remaining Xuelifu, etc., to post 30 yuan bail each and reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>East Tide and South Tide, Extremely Spectacular</p>
<p>The China Travel Service has been organizing Haining tide-watching tours for many years, and its achievements are well known. This year, it has also launched an Eight Forts tide-watching tour to provide mental enjoyment for those who have not seen or have already seen the Zhejiang tide. According to Mr. Tang of the company, he has been to Eight Forts five or six times and has seen tides that are all strange, majestic, and more spectacular than those in Haining. When the tide comes to Eight Forts, it is divided into two types: the East Tide and the South Tide. The South Tide comes before the East Tide. When the two tides meet, they collide, agitate, and splash, creating waves that can be several feet high. As the saying goes, "When it comes, it is like ten thousand horses galloping and thousands of troops shouting. When it goes, it is like a snow mountain collapsing and a silver cliff falling down." It is shocking and terrifying, like a group of tigers chasing sheep. Eight Forts is about ten miles east of Haining. Cars can go directly there. It is heard that the company has built a high enclosure on the cement dike in Eight Forts, with seating for four or five hundred people. From October 5th to the 10th, it will provide dozens of new-style small cars every day to travel between Hangzhou and Eight Forts, with comfortable and fast seating.</p>

<p>Zhang Taicheng, the 66-year-old father of Huang Zhang, a woman from Suqian, Jiangbei, was a worker on Shama Road. At 3:30 PM on the 19th of this month, he was working on the Bund in the French Concession, carrying a basket of stones with someone named Jia. A truck No. 122 driven by carter A Mao came along and did not have time to avoid it, causing Zhang to be knocked down and run over. He was sent to the hospital, but due to his old age, the treatment was ineffective, and he died on the 23rd. After reporting the incident, Magistrate Zhu Cheng arrived to conduct an autopsy and confirmed the facts. He ordered the family to put the body in a coffin and wait for verification. Yesterday, the police summoned both parties to the French Court for questioning. Huang Zhang, the daughter of the deceased, filed a complaint about the previous situation and said that her father was killed, and requested justice.

<h3 id="e148">Sales of Shoddy Small Silver Coins as Merchandise <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Had Been Melted Down in Silver Furnaces Several Times</p>
<p>Shen Jinliang and Others Were Acquitted</p>
<p>Feng Shuofu and other detectives from the General Patrol Room's Inspection Department previously searched the Hongda Xiaoqianzhuang at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Shandong Road and found more than 2,000 inferior double dimes and hundreds of single dimes that were not circulating in Shanghai. Shen Jinliang, the shop assistant, and others were detained and sent to the Special District Court for questioning. This has already been recorded in this newspaper. The trial continued yesterday morning. The defendant invited the Tian surname, a worker from Laoqing Silver Furnace, to testify with the account books. It was said that Hongda had sold the inferior small silver coins to the silver furnace for melting several times and they were not circulating in the market. When questioned, the defendant Shen Jinliang and others said that when Detective Feng sent them to buy them, they did not want to sell them, but the person said they were buying them on behalf of the Zhabei small silver furnace, so they sold them for two yuan, totaling thirty corners, and told them not to use them. They also hired Wang Fuchang as a lawyer to argue that the defendant sold the inferior small coins as merchandise and not as currency, so they did not constitute the crime they were accused of. After debating with the police lawyer, Presiding Judge Zhou questioned the circumstances of the search again and acquitted the three defendants, Shen Jinliang, etc. The inferior coins were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Stealing Money to Free a Prostitute <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Prostitutes Cannot Be Resold to Repay Debts</p>
<p>Prostitution Requires a Separate Lawsuit</p>
<p>Liu Jisheng Imprisoned for One Year</p>
<p>Liu Jisheng from Anhui stole 2,800 yuan in cash from his employer Cai's savings book in Anqing and came to Shanghai to visit prostitutes. He used 800 yuan to free the prostitute Wang Youqin and take her as his wife, and bought her gold jewelry. He deposited the remaining 1,000 yuan in the Bank of China. Cai found out about this, took a boat to Shanghai, and reported the incident to the Old Gate Police Station. The police detained Liu and the prostitute and sent them to the Special District Court for questioning. This has already been recorded in previous reports. The trial continued yesterday morning. Liu admitted to stealing money from his employer in Shanghai and visiting prostitutes, saying that he had freed the prostitute to take her as his wife. However, the prostitute Wang denied this, saying that she was free and did not need to be freed, and she did not marry Liu. The house and furniture were all rented by her, and Liu only stayed at her place temporarily, and he was not only in love with her. Then, the police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that Liu Jisheng's crime of theft had been established, so the gold watch, gold ring, the Bank of China's 1,000 yuan deposit book, and miscellaneous items should all be given to Cai Zhe, as they were all purchased with the stolen money. As for the prostitute, although she was also redeemed with the stolen money, it was impossible to resell her to get the money back. However, the prostitute's prostitution without a permit was also illegal, so although she was not criminally responsible for this case, the police must file a separate lawsuit for secret prostitution. Presiding Judge Zhou then ordered the prostitute Wang to post 200 yuan bail, and Liu Jisheng was sentenced to one year in prison for theft. The deposit book and gold jewelry were all given to Cai Zhe.</p>

At 6:00 PM the night before last, Liang's family members were having dinner, but Liang drank three-snake wine alone. After drinking half a glass, his expression suddenly changed, and he suddenly became unable to speak. His wife, Li, and his son, Jinghong, took him to Tongren Hospital, but the doctors could not diagnose him. His illness worsened rapidly, and he died at 2:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police, who ordered detectives to investigate and took the body to the Autopsy Office on Feilun Road. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Xu Mei, a prosecutor commissioned by the Special District Court, arrived at the office to inspect the body. According to the Western Deputy Chief, the circumstances of the death were quite bizarre, and the police could not investigate the cause of death. However, the deceased had drunk three-snake wine in the last few minutes before his death, so they suspected that the wine was suspicious and requested that the wine be examined. The three-snake wine was presented for inspection. After inspecting it, Mr. Xu announced that the wine was definitely not the cause of death, but a good medicine for treating madness and rheumatism, and was well-known in Guangdong Province, as Mr. Xu was from Guangdong and knew about it. Then, the wife of the deceased, Li, filed a case requesting exemption from autopsy. Mr. Xu agreed that since the family requested exemption from autopsy, the court did not need to do so. He then ordered that the death of Liang Ruichu was due to illness and that the body be handed over to his son, Liang Jinghong, for coffining. According to the autopsy performed by the court doctor, the deceased was bleeding from the mouth, which appeared to be death by poisoning.</p>

<p>The Car Was Driving Fast</p>
<p>The Police Were Suspicious</p>
<p>At around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a large cargo truck with the number 3844 was found on Wusong Jungong Road. The truck was carrying two empty bamboo baskets, a driver, and another person squatting in the truck bed. The truck was traveling from west to east at the highest speed. As it drove across the Yunzaobang Bridge, it was seen by the police officer on duty at the First Branch of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau. Because its speed was illegal, he ordered it to stop. However, the driver did not listen and continued to drive. The police officer reported it to the Seventh District via telephone. The truck was finally intercepted by the police at the Ninth Post of the Seventh District on the outer road, and a dead body was found in the truck. The police were shocked and immediately sent the driver to the Seventh District. After questioning by District Chief Yang, the driver said his name was Shi A Gen, and the deceased's name was Wu Fusheng. He fell from the upstairs the day before and suffered serious injuries. He was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Because the injuries were critical, he died yesterday morning. The hospital was hired by the family to transport the body to Chongming, his hometown, for burial. Then, the family filed a case stating the previous situation. After verifying the statements, District Chief Yang sent Detective Yu Peifa to Shanghai to investigate at Baolong Hospital. The hospital proved the facts. District Chief Yang, seeing that there was no criminal behavior, released the truck driver and the truck. The body was handed over to the family after signing a statement.</p>

<p>Dai Yangui, 32, a driver for the Jianghai Customs patrol boat, boarded a sampan at the Zhaofeng Wharf on the 24th of this month to work on the patrol boat. Unexpectedly, when he was in the river, a small wheel from the Shanghai Transportation Company passed by and overturned the sampan. Dai fell into the river and disappeared. Until yesterday, the Water Patrol Police Station on Weituoma Road recovered the body in front of the Gaoqiao gunpowder depot. The police chief ordered Deng Jiagen to send the body to the Rescue Bureau at the South Wharf. Then, the detective took the family member Dai Chen to the court to report the autopsy. The family also requested justice. The court commissioned Prosecutor Wang to arrive at the scene in the afternoon and confirmed that the death was due to drowning. He ordered the body to be buried and waited for further action.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Homicide Suspect Arrested in Shanghai <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Gu Achuan, a 44-year-old tenant farmer from Baijia Township, Liuhe Town, Taicang, had once come to Shanghai several years ago to work as a worker in a foreign-owned yarn factory. After neglecting his duties, he was recommended by a friend to work as a tea server in a small inn. Two years ago, due to physical weakness, he could not fulfill his duties and returned to Liuhe to guard his land, experiencing extreme hardship. He was married to a woman named Lu, who was 45 years old and of a promiscuous nature. She and a fellow villager named Gu Yunzhou (45 years old), also a tenant farmer in Liuhe, had been having an affair for nearly ten years. Last year, around September of the lunar calendar, Gu Yunzhou came to Shanghai, working various hard labor jobs such as operating bellows, selling dried tofu, and working as a road construction worker. Unexpectedly, on February 12th of this year in the lunar calendar, Gu Achuan was murdered by Lu and her stepbrother Xu Asheng (Lu's biological mother was a remarried woman married to Xu Asheng's father) in a joint plot. While Lu and Xu have already been arrested by the Taicang County government for interrogation and detention, Gu Yunzhou, having had an affair with Lu for many years, could not escape significant suspicion. The county magistrate repeatedly ordered the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau to arrest and bring him to justice for questioning. Bureau Chief Yu Keng then specially dispatched police officer Cui Shuren on September 23rd, carrying a letter to Shanghai to search for and arrest him everywhere. The day before yesterday afternoon, the police officer received a tip, stating that Gu Yunzhou was currently hiding in the Yilou Teahouse near the Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession. The police officer sent a letter to the teahouse to inquire, but Gu happened to be nearby, discovered the situation, and fled towards Zhaozhou Road in the Chinese district. He was spotted by police officer Wang Yinzhu of the Second District General Office, who was on patrol. Suspecting his behavior, Wang detained him. At the same time, the police officer sent from Taicang also arrived upon hearing the news and presented the original letter. After careful examination by District Chief Wang, Gu directly admitted to having an affair with Achuan's wife for many years, but absolutely denied plotting to murder Achuan. Officer Cui requested to take him back to Taicang for investigation. District Chief Wang submitted a document to the Judicial Section yesterday for instructions.</p>

<p>American firm Schenk &amp; Mertz apologizes to Chen Zixun in writing</p>
<p>Schenk &amp; Mertz, due to outstanding payments for machinery supplied to the Hengda Yarn Factory, had repeatedly filed lawsuits with the former Provisional Court and the Shanghai Local Court, involving Chen Zixun, manager of the Henglong Bank and representative of the creditor group. Now, after prominent figures in the business community intervened to mediate, a settlement has been reached. However, Schenk &amp; Mertz, having included Mr. Chen as a defendant in the criminal lawsuit due to a misunderstanding, specifically issued a letter to Mr. Chen to express their apologies, hoping to restore good relations. The translation of the original letter is provided below:</p>
<p>To Mr. Chen Zixun,</p>
<p>Regarding the lawsuit between Schenk &amp; Mertz and the Hengda Yarn Factory, now, thanks to the friendly intervention of Mr. Xie Hengchuang, Mr. Mu Ouchu, Mr. Wu Linshu, Mr. Yao Mulian, Mr. Lu Bohong, and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a satisfactory resolution has been reached, which is truly gratifying. Our firm now understands that the cause of this case was entirely due to misleading statements made by Mr. Mu Shuzhai to you and the public nomination of you by the creditors as their agent. As a result, our firm had no choice but to file a criminal lawsuit with the Provisional Court, including you as one of the defendants, which is extremely regrettable. Our appointed legal counsel has already petitioned the courts to withdraw all parts of the civil, criminal, and appeal aspects of this case, in order to reach a peaceful resolution. We sincerely hope that the friendship between both parties can be restored as before.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Fulenchu, Representative of Schenk &amp; Mertz</p>

<p>Requires Examination by the Local Court</p>
<p>Shen Fasheng, a 49-year-old tea server from Minhang working at the Lianyi Silk Weaving Factory on Guohuo Road, died yesterday.

The Second District Police Station, after investigation, found that although the deceased was reported to have died from illness, there was no doctor's prescription or final doctor's certificate, which is not in compliance with municipal regulations. Fearing that there might be other circumstances, they instructed Gu Tiyun, the head of the 25th Bao, 12th Tu, to report to the Local Court for examination. The family of the deceased requested exemption from the examination.</p>

<p>Ling Cheng, a native of Wujiang residing at No. 31, Nanpu Yu Li, West Gate, and employed at the Jiangnan Paper Mill, previously lost some small items and suspected the second landlord, Li Songshi, of stealing them. He questioned Li about it. Unexpectedly, Li Songshi also claimed to have lost items and said to Ling, "Who should I ask?" This led to a verbal altercation. Unexpectedly, Li Songshi, in a fit of anger, swallowed a gold ring in an attempt to end her life. Ling Cheng, upon hearing this, became alarmed, fearing a death, and sent Li Songshi to the Qu Zhifu Hospital on Zhonghua Road for treatment. The hospital director immediately provided treatment, stating that there should be no problem.

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I read in your newspaper's "Local News" column on September 21st an article titled "The Triad Gang is Active," which stated, "The Weihai captain is relatively astute." I was formerly the chief engineer of the Weihai warship and an instructor at the torpedo training school, not the captain. This is factually incorrect. I am writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Upon investigation, I found that in a news item published in your newspaper's "Local News" column on July 14th, there was a phrase "Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China." The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee is located in Nanjing and belongs to the party and government organs. Our association is located in Shanghai and belongs to the mass organizations. The nature is completely different. Our association has been organized under the direct orders of the Prime Minister since the first year of the Republic of China and has been named "Overseas Chinese Federation." It has never had the name "Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee." The news on that day was presumably an error by an outside contributor, and our association was completely unaware of it. The descriptions are also inconsistent with the facts. Our association did not read it at the time, so we were unable to correct it in a timely manner. Fortunately, someone informed us, and we finally found and read it in the newspaper pile. We are writing to request that your newspaper publish this letter in the corrections column. We would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Federation</p>

<p>To the Editor of the Shenbao,</p>
<p>Regarding the incident of theft at the Aiwenyi Road Yongchang Pawnshop in your newspaper on September 23rd, the amount of the loss is incorrect. After investigation, the stolen jewelry and pawned goods were worth 700 yuan, and the cash, including the money of friends, was 1,366 yuan, for a total of 2,066 yuan. Please correct this to reflect the actual amount. We would be very grateful.</p>

<h3 id="e170">A Brief Account of the Public Memorial Ceremony for Mr. Zeng Nongran <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Candle Boy</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng Nongran of Hengyang, with his integrity and literary talent, was highly respected in his time. In recent years, he sought refuge in Shanghai, supporting himself by selling his calligraphy. Unfortunately, he passed away on August 27th. Mr. Zeng had students all over the world. His death was deeply mourned by all. A public memorial ceremony was held at Mr. Zeng's residence on Dongyouheng Road on the afternoon of the 25th of the month. Those who attended included Zhang Shanzi, Huang Xiaoting, Li Jianchu, Ma Qizhou, Zhu Dake, Jiang Wanping, Mi Zhemin, Yao Yunjiang, Xu Guanqun, Jiang Yiping, Zhang Jifeng, Ma Zonghuo, Liu Junying, Xie Weifan, and Xiang Moan. The ceremony was presided over by Mr. Zhao Yangjiao, an old friend of Mr. Zeng, and the eulogy was read by Zeng Yiyun. Incense was offered and wine was poured, and the ceremony was conducted with proper etiquette. After the ceremony, the gentlemen initiated the organization of an alumni association. Anyone who had studied under Mr. Zeng was welcome to join. Memorial ceremonies would be held twice a year, in spring and autumn. The gentlemen's deep remembrance of Mr. Zeng and their dedication to honoring him demonstrated Mr. Zeng's careful guidance and enduring love for others. The eulogy was written by Mr. Ma Zonghuo. Its classical and simple style was truly masterful. It is appended here to glimpse Mr. Zeng's scholarship and character.</p>
<p>The Loushan Mountain, truly the southern boundary.</p>
<p>The Cheng flows from its belly, the Xiang passes its tail.</p>
<p>Holding pearls and nurturing jade, pregnant with heng and carrying zhi.</p>
<p>Things are not uniquely endowed, philosophers are enlightened.</p>
<p>What is enlightenment? Mr. exemplifies it.</p>
<p>His sagacious nature is innate, his filial piety and friendship are heavenly.</p>
<p>Born with a precocious nature, his mother is the source.</p>
<p>Sipping snow and eating wind, his form relies on the shadows.</p>
<p>He broadcast his outstanding reputation, shaking the algae in the village school.</p>
<p>Ascending to the capital, he entered the imperial court.</p>
<p>Serving the emperor, he raised the masses.</p>
<p>He did not indulge in good fortune, but praised his mother's chastity.</p>
<p>Suddenly, national changes occurred, and the mother's shadow withered.</p>
<p>The land had no spirit, the heavens had no mercy.</p>
<p>Thus he untied his worldly ties and returned to his original state.</p>
<p>He lived in strict poverty and placed his pride in the pine and bamboo.</p>
<p>Autumn searched and spring stretched, smoke flowed and the moon was solemn.</p>
<p>A single touch could bring joy, his solitary fragrance bloomed.</p>
<p>Then there was a good invitation to travel.</p>
<p>Walking along the river and crossing the lake, pointing east to the sea.</p>
<p>Elders gathered and stopped, their hearts resonating.</p>
<p>It was said to be a refuge, but it also expressed their worries.</p>
<p>Since then, he lived in leisure, not associating with the nobles of the time.</p>
<p>His body was in harmony, and his relationship with others was as strong as gold and stone.</p>
<p>He encompassed the nine streams and extensively summarized the arts.</p>
<p>Whether it was poetry or prose, calligraphy or painting.</p>
<p>His poetry emphasized meaning, not confined to one school.</p>
<p>It was as light as the clouds and as beautiful as the afterglow.</p>
<p>He often said that with distant scenery, why should there be extravagant words?</p>

<p>Clouds gathered and trees mixed, water surrounded and mountains overlapped.</p>
<p>Holding a brush, he was distant, I was the law.</p>
<p>Encompassing these four wonders, like silk on a loom.</p>
<p>A person has one of them, and it is enough to be proud.</p>
<p>Only our teacher, humble and respectful and tall.</p>
<p>Embracing the new with transformation, answering questions without tiring.</p>
<p>His remaining glory is far away, and his hidden virtue is more magnificent.</p>
<p>Looking at him, they come to worship, malaria and opportunity.</p>
<p>Ren and Shou only heard, dragons and snakes were doomed.</p>
<p>Hou Yan was still warm, listening to the sound was swift.</p>
<p>Who said a hundred years, vanished in an instant?</p>
<p>What was the fault of the medicine? Heaven was the true culprit.</p>
<p>Alas, alas! The strong wind blows in the evening, and the dew is thick in the morning.</p>
<p>How far away is the teacher? Who is happy for him?</p>
<p>Once received a cane, now offer a cup.</p>
<p>May words be forever cherished, tears overflowing.</p>
<p>Writing to send grief, grieve for its exhaustion.</p>
<p>Alas, alas!</p>
<h3 id="e171">The Remote Striking Technique of the Monks of Tianning Temple <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Chunfan</p>
<p>It is said that in Bagua Palm there is a "隔小掌" (gé xiǎo zhǎng, "separated small palm") technique, which can strike a person from a hundred paces away. It can even penetrate a wall. The Northern Chinese colloquialism calls it "隔山打牛" (gé shān dǎ niú, "striking an ox across the mountain") or "百步打空" (bǎi bù dǎ kōng, "striking emptiness from a hundred paces").</p>
<p>During the late Qing dynasty, there was a monk named Pu Yin at Huguo Temple in Changzhou. He was originally a notorious thief, capable of robbing lone travelers dozens or even hundreds of miles away at night or before dawn. After the robbery, he would return to the temple as if carried by the wind. Traveling dozens of miles only took a moment. Therefore, the monks in the temple did not suspect Pu Yin of being a thief.</p>
<p>Once, before dawn, Pu Yin robbed a traveler near Benniu. The traveler had 200 yuan in silver with him, intending to sell soybeans in Changzhou. He was traveling in the dark when he was robbed by Pu Yin. Fortunately, the traveler had an extraordinary gift: once he saw someone, he could recognize them for life. Although their faces were not easily distinguishable in the starlight, he had already silently memorized them in his mind, knowing that it was a monk.</p>
<p>After Pu Yin robbed him of the 200 yuan, he fled swiftly. The traveler trudged to the city, intending to seek help from relatives and friends. He also wanted to visit various temples to find this thieving monk. He first went to the dining hall of Huguo Temple. The monks were having breakfast. The traveler suddenly saw Pu Yin and recognized him as the thief. However, he dared not reveal it immediately. He went to the abbot and told him. The abbot was shocked and quickly sent Pu Yin away. He then searched his luggage and found the stolen goods still there.</p>
<p>The abbot wanted to capture him, but he knew that Pu Yin's martial arts were extremely high and he was not easy to capture. He sought help from the abbot of Tianning Temple. The abbot sent two old monks to help. Before they left, the abbot warned them, "Although you two are skilled in martial arts, it is not certain whether you are superior to Pu Yin. I guess that when you arrive, he will break through the roof to escape. When he breaks through the roof, you must judge by the curvature of his knees. If he bends his knees as he goes up, you can capture him. If he doesn't bend and goes straight, then you cannot defeat him." The two monks agreed and set off.</p>
<p>They arrived at Huguo Temple together. They first sat in the dining hall to wait. Soon, all the monks arrived. As the monks were eating, the traveler suddenly entered, pointed at Pu Yin, and said, "This is the thief who robbed me of 200 yuan!" The abbot shouted sternly, "Capture him!" Pu Yin had already sprung up in response, breaking through the roof to escape. However, his knees did not bend. The two monks from Tianning Temple also flew up from the hole in the roof. In a blink of an eye, Pu Yin had been captured by the two monks. They tied him up and took him to a lime pit to be burned.</p>
<p>The lime boiled, and the ropes snapped. Pu Yin, blind and with exposed bones, still managed to climb onto a short wall and stroke his ribs with his fleshless hand. A vegetable seller nearby saw this and was greatly alarmed, thinking it was a monster. He raised his hoe and struck him, instantly killing him and causing him to fall into the pool.</p>
<p>One of the two monks from Tianning Temple, named Gui Xiang, was skilled in the "remote striking" technique. He could carry two buckets of water on his shoulders and fly up to the nine-zhang-high (about 30 meters) roof of the main hall when it caught fire. I once strongly urged him to demonstrate his remote striking technique. He first closed the door, then extended his fist from more than twenty paces away. The door would immediately make a loud "砰" (pēng, bang) sound. He tried this three times, and it was always the same. I also wanted him to strike an ox and a dog, but the monk declined, clasping his hands in refusal. He said that he had once been a recorded admiral in the Qing army but had realized that life was just like this, so he had become a monk. Now, more than thirty years have passed. Gui Xiang has long since passed away, and his remote striking technique has no successor.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Against-the-Mouth Fungus <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Mai Lun</p>
<p>Our country's medical arts often involve extraordinary cures. Frequently, their efficacy defies rational explanation, approaching the miraculous. This is something Western medicine cannot comprehend. For example, the treatment of stubborn diseases using "Against-the-Mouth Fungus" is truly remarkable.</p>
<p>Tradition holds that Against-the-Mouth Fungus grows in desolate tombs between broken coffins. It is found as a fungal growth projecting from the underside of the coffin lid, positioned directly opposite the corpse's mouth. This substance is then acquired and said to cure all ailments, especially tuberculosis, with extraordinary results. I initially doubted this. I once asked a famous doctor about it. He said, "Although this medicine is not in the 'Compendium of Materia Medica,' I did see it once in the residence of a prominent official, Mr. Sheng. It has saved many lives. If we analyze it medically, it might be a crystallized product of Yin and Yang interacting." Later, I heard from a German doctor who said, "This is not impossible. The reason it can be obtained and used to treat stubborn diseases is probably accidental, like using talismans to cure illnesses. The illness might improve, but it's not actually due to the talisman." He then strongly criticized Chinese medicine for often misleading people with superstition, which seemed quite reasonable. So, the Against-the-Mouth Fungus is truly a miraculous substance that cannot be understood by ordinary reasoning.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I heard someone say that in the new fourteen-episode movie "Red Lotus Temple" by the Mingxing Film Company, an "Against-the-Mouth Fungus" serves as the main plot thread. It depicts two factions of swordsmen fighting over the fungus in a fierce and ever-changing battle, full of strange and varied occurrences. Initially, the Against-the-Mouth Fungus is obtained by an ape. From the ape, it becomes the object of a tortuous struggle. It presents a rather bizarre spectacle. Could this Against-the-Mouth Fungus truly be a miraculous object? This is truly incomprehensible.</p>
<p>I also remember hearing my grandmother say when I was young that my grandfather once suffered from tuberculosis. Later, a traveling doctor came and said he had an Against-the-Mouth Fungus and was willing to sell it for two hundred gold pieces. When asked where it came from, he said it was obtained from a desolate tomb outside Changsha. He then described the story of the Against-the-Mouth Fungus in vivid detail, just like the popular folk tales around Changsha and the strange stories written in irresponsible novels. Now, the film made by Mingxing is probably based on this story and embellished. With such varied and fantastical elements, it is bound to cause a sensation. There is nothing strange that doesn't exist in the world. The glittering silver screen should satisfy the curious.</p>
<h3 id="e173">The Anti-Communist Movement of Finnish Farmers (1) <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ceng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>(1) The Origin of the Lapua Movement</p>
<p>The recent anti-communist movement of Finnish farmers, known as the Lapua Movement (Lapua is the name of a small parish in Ostrobothnia, near Vaasa. The Finnish anti-communist movement first started there, hence the name), has attracted considerable attention in European public opinion. There are concerns that this movement could cause conflict between Finland and its eastern neighbor, Soviet Russia, thereby affecting European peace. Therefore, we cannot ignore it as a matter confined to a small Nordic country.</p>
<p>Before discussing the reasons for the emergence of this movement, it is necessary to examine the activities of the Communist Party in Finland. Finland's independence from Russia began in 1917. From this time onward, communist propaganda, directed and funded by the Moscow Third International, began its activities in Finland. While workers in major cities and industrial centers expressed deep sympathy, the intellectual class completely opposed it. The content of communist propaganda in Finland was the same as in other countries: opposition to the existing political, economic, religious, and military systems. On the platforms of parliament, in the deliberations of city councils, and in newspapers, communist members openly advocated for the overthrow of the current system by force. They also took advantage of Finland's system of freedom of publication and association to expand their propaganda.</p>
<p>However, the more intense the communist activities, the stricter the government's surveillance. Whenever necessary, strict measures were taken to suppress communist activity, attempting to fundamentally eliminate its propaganda. In 1923, all communist members of parliament were imprisoned. Other important communists were also severely punished. Moreover, the Communist Party was deemed an illegal party and prohibited from operating, setting a precedent.</p>
<p>Afterward, although most communist officials were imprisoned, new personnel, organized and trained in Russia, continuously infiltrated Finland to fill the vacancies. As a result, in the last parliamentary election, communist members, using the names of the Workers and Small Farmers Party (Parti des ouvriers et des paysans), obtained as many as 130,000 votes, occupying twenty-three seats in the two-hundred-seat parliament.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(1) Introduction</p>
<p>In Europe, modern art is concentrated in Paris. People accustomed to seeing art in Paris are often dissatisfied when they see modern paintings, sculptures, or even architecture and crafts in any other country. However, the source of modern art is the Italian Renaissance. The art of the Renaissance, of course, follows the art of Greece and Rome. To study the Renaissance and earlier art, one must make a pilgrimage to Italy. I live in Paris, and I have more contact with modern art. Although I have seen Greek and Roman sculptures in the Louvre, and the works of Giotto, Botticelli, Fra Angelico, Giorgione, Masaccio, Filippo Lippi, Mantegna, Giovanni Bellini, Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, Titian, Tintoretto, and Veronese, I already had a slight understanding of the outline of Greek and Roman sculptures and Renaissance art. But I still felt it was not enough. I could not put it down. Recently, because I was determined to trace the source of modern art, I traced back in history, from modern art to the paintings of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in France, and then to the paintings of Spain and the Netherlands, all of which had direct or indirect relationships. To put it bluntly, all modern European art originates from the Renaissance. Because of this, my desire to visit Italy became even stronger. This kind of pilgrimage is more deeply ingrained in my mind than any other major event. This kind of feeling, not only is it in me, but all people who study art should at least think this way. If you like Delacroix, you should at least understand Rubens and Tintoretto. If you like E. Manet, you should at least understand Velazquez. If you want to understand Velazquez, you have to study Titian. If you like Cezanne, you should at least have seen Veronese and El Greco. Recently, from the works and books of various people, I have been pursuing the works of the glorious period of the Renaissance. Indeed, a pilgrimage to various parts of Italy is necessary to obtain a thorough understanding. If you want to see Tintoretto, Veronese, Titian, Tiepolo, then you should go to Venice. If you want to see the works of Michelangelo, Raphael, Botticelli, Angelico, Lippi, Andrea del Sarto, and da Vinci, you should go to Rome and Florence. Because their great works are abundantly contained in those small and bright gardens. Therefore, I departed from Paris on May 29th, 1919, to travel to various parts of Italy. But in this short period of one month, I went to four famous art cities: Rome, Florence, Venice, and Milan. I saw too many things. I wanted to pick up my pen to write many times, but I always felt like there was no way to start like a twenty-four history. Now I have to take my pilgrimage diary and publish it here first. In terms of art, what I feel is that I will write it out section by section after I have fully and seriously examined and checked it from all aspects. I am determined not to say a few abstract words in a general and superficial way to fill the role of an expert. In the end, after my pilgrimage to Italy, I have a beautiful and great faith in Italian art. This beautiful and great faith will not disappoint me for the rest of my life. This is what I can tell the readers first.</p>

The actual sales of guest gangs are more calm. The standard yarn market stopped trading for one day due to the end of the month delivery. Checking the statistics of various gangs buying spot yarn throughout the day, 552 bales were purchased, 130 bales were entered among the same industry, and the market conditions were similar to the previous day. 200 bales were entered by the guest gang from Qingdao, 100 bales from the mainland, 40 bales from Wuhu, 25 bales from Sichuan, 50 bales from Qinhuangdao, 40 bales from Shantou, 75 bales from Guangdong, and 25 bales from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<p>Cotton Market: Overseas cotton markets are trending downward, with the situation getting worse and worse. Under this pressure, although there have been changes in people's perceptions, the overall trend in the local cotton market is still calm. This is because the output from various production areas is not surging, and the price is also difficult to fall. However, the demand is greatly deserted. As for the goods arriving at the pier, there are 895 bales of Yao cotton, 1,300 bales of Tong cotton, and the sales are recorded as 32.00 for Huoji cotton, 700 bales of East cotton for the Xindong cotton mill, Yao cotton one flower 21.80, 400 bales for the Guangdong help, one flower from the stock market and traffic flower 33.2 to 4.0, 500 bales for the industry, and more.</p>

<p>And the Market Course</p>
<p>The standard yarn market in September showed a rather unstable state at the beginning of the month, with prices hovering between 153 and 4 taels. In fact, the world cotton industry situation was sluggish, and US cotton gradually discovered new low prices, and the situation was chaotic and unhealthy, resulting in sluggish sales. The Chaozhou gang threw away a lot, with about 150,000 bales of inventory, the buyer was empty, although a manufacturer tried to support it, but the general trend was difficult to hold the building alone, so there was a big drop, breaking through the 50 tael mark, the lowest once reached 148 taels and 5 qian, before long the northern situation changed, there was a message of peace, and the Jin army collapsed, so the market was greatly shaken, and a manufacturer continued to buy in and increase the code, the market suddenly rose sharply, and even jumped out of the 50 tael mark, but the situation was turbulent, and many retail investors were hedging, killing the shorts, at the same time the actual demand was more upbeat, people's hearts were tighter, and the highest once reached 154 taels and 5 qian, and then the deliverers were still not lacking, Wufu Muyang sold another 3,000 bales, and the last market suddenly fell by 2 taels and 8 qian due to floating households carelessness, and the result was 151 taels, the delivery price was 153 taels, a total of 3,650 bales, the actual delivery was only 1,900 bales, and the remaining 1,750 bales, independent delivery was calculated as 25 Fuxing 1,250 bales, Muyang 600 bales, 50 bales of sixteen-branch red dragon, and Hengda was still the most received, 1,900 bales, 5 borrowed Muyang was the most delivered, with a total of 558,450 taels, now the total number of brokers and packages on both the receiving and delivery sides are recorded separately below.</p>

<p>Spot sales in Bombay were quite active last week. In the futures market, due to large purchases by Far Eastern exporters, the downward trend was curbed, and market prices were firm. The price difference between American and Indian cotton narrowed. China made some transactions at low prices, and Japan's transactions were very strong at the beginning of the week, then declined. Cotton harvest reports from all cotton-producing areas were favorable. The attached weekly statistics are as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1929  1930</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts from September 1  4642</p>
<p>Weekend stock 747  567</p>
<p>Cumulative exports from September 1  1131 60</p>

<p>Spot demand in Liverpool improved last week. Short selling in the futures market was absorbed by scattered buyers, but it still could not prevent the decline in market prices. According to reports, the US government intends to further assist agriculture, but sentiment remains bearish. Egyptian cotton showed no special characteristics, and market prices fell slightly with American cotton. At the weekend, due to the liquidation of Alexandria's long positions, the decline was even greater.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Rice Market in the Lower Reaches of the River Continues to Rise by Half a Dollar <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply from Luli in Zhabei was scarce, only around the 20th. The sales in the Puben Street market were very brisk. There was not much Xixin Japonica rice in stock, and arrivals were not strong. This was because some vendors were affected by the sharp drop last week and suffered heavy losses, so those with insufficient capital were unable to transport goods, reducing the supply. However, due to the overcast and rainy weather in the morning, buying interest was very active, and prices continued to rise by half a dollar. The highest price opened at seventeen dollars and thirty cents, while the middle grade jumped eight cents, with prices hovering between sixteen dollars and thirty to forty cents. Dongxin Japonica rice also rose by four to five cents, with large quantities at fifteen dollars and seventy to eighty cents. As the arrival of Yangdu Indica rice was scarce, sales were actually brisk, and prices rose by four cents to five and a half cents. Special high-grade goods opened at around thirteen dollars and fifty cents, and port tip opened at a high of twelve dollars and forty cents, and customer tip at eleven dollars and thirty cents. The above two types only rebounded by two cents. The market trend was stable, and the arrival and sales of Baiyuan were evenly matched, with no price fluctuations. Overall, the entire Japonica and Indica rice market was entirely due to the overcast weather, which caused uncertainty in the market. However, if the weather clears up, prices will immediately fall back.</p>
<p>Twenty to thirty ships arrived in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River in South Shanghai. Buying interest was quite brisk, and the situation was very good. The new Japonica rice on Nanshi and Xishi Roads all rose by four to five cents, and transactions became more active. However, the market for fragrant rice was flat, and although arrivals were not abundant, sales were also sluggish. However, all stalls rose because they were raised by two to three cents, with prices opening at fourteen dollars and fifty cents. Yangxian rice rose from firm to high, with prices shouted up by about three cents, and Dujian rice also rose by three to four cents, with high-grade goods at the thirteen-dollar mark. The overall situation was stable, and prices were similar to those in North Shanghai. The rice situation here also depends on the weather for a change.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Customer Indica Rice Market Arrival Lacks Support <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of customer Indica rice decreased, and sales became more active. In addition to the local rural villages, the Beiyang gang also bought 400-500 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice, so the sluggish market in the past few days temporarily turned lively, and prices also slightly firmed. For example, Nanjing and Wuhu rice, which were recently loaded, were also sold. If arrivals remain low today and tomorrow, and local customers still need to clear out stocks, the market may be able to stabilize temporarily. The overall market offered 1,000 bags of Jiangxi early machine-milled rice at $11.00 to $10.55, and 170 bags of late machine-milled rice at $12.40, and the next grade at $10.09, and 300 bags of Yuan machine-milled rice at $16.30, the middle grade from $15.50 to $13.30, 500 bags of Nanjing machine-milled rice at $9.85 to $9.30, over 100 bags of Wuhu machine-milled rice at $10.02, and 200 bags of Nanguan rice at $9.25.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Flour Market Opens with a Sharp Drop of Three Cents <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a consistent sharp decline across all months after the opening, with the December and January/February futures being particularly weak, falling by as much as three cents compared to last week's closing price. This was because the current prices of imported flour and wheat were quite suitable compared to the domestic wheat and flour markets. After various factories had already secured large quantities of foreign flour, they continued to purchase a certain amount due to the favorable prices, and then hedged by selling on the exchange, leading to a daily decline in the flour market. After the opening yesterday, due to the bearish sentiment, prices fell sharply, and were then supported by a certain factory, causing the market to stabilize. However, the prices of various distant months did not improve due to the arrival of foreign flour and wheat, and the closing price for the current month was only slightly down by five li, the next month remained unchanged, November was down by seven and a half li, December was down by one and a half cents, January was down by two cents, and February was down by one and three-quarters cents.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Wheat Market Amidst Talk of Affordable Foreign Wheat <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Spot and Futures Down Seven or Eight Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, opening prices immediately fell by three to four cents due to the impact of affordable imported wheat and flour arriving in Shanghai. Later, the market was slightly supported by the flour market, and there was some short covering, but as a result of the realization of foreign wheat orders, the prices of distant months (January and February) suddenly and repeatedly fell sharply. This was because the price of foreign wheat was originally low, making it quite suitable for purchase. Yesterday, certain factories placed new orders, and hedged by selling on the market, so the January/February futures fell to 4 taels, 4 qian and 6-7 fen, a drop of seven or eight cents compared to last week. Near-term prices also fell by three to four cents. There were few spot wheat arrivals and large stockpiles, and factories had long been intending to sell. Yesterday, small and medium-sized factories bought three to four thousand bags of truck shipments from Shandong, Taizhuang, Qingjiang, Xinyang, Zhou, etc., at prices of only 4 taels, 6 qian and 6-7 fen to 4 qian and 5 fen, also about one qian lower than last week.</p>

<p>Yesterday, there was no news from the sugar-producing areas, Taikoo, and New York. The association's market quoted Dutch sugar #24 coarse white, but buying interest remained high. Old stock was quoted at 7 taels and 8 cents, but few were willing to accept it. New stock was quoted at 8 taels and 2.5 cents. Although there were some transactions, it fell by another 2.5 cents compared to before, and the market was flat and sluggish. Dutch red sugar sales were quite brisk, and stocks were low, so prices gradually increased. #8 goods were at 6 taels and 4 qian, #10 goods were at 6 taels and 7 qian, and also 6 taels and 2.5 qian. The trend was still quite good. Transactions of Japanese sugar were few and far between.

The brokers' interest was still strong, and the sale was quickly completed. The Liqi Trading Company sold 3,000 bags of Dutch sugar on the road at a price of 6 dollars and 5 cents in Dutch currency plus the new tax.</p>

<p>This year's autumn silkworm rearing in the towns and villages of Wuxi has approximately doubled compared to last year. Unfortunately, due to adverse weather conditions, coupled with uneven breeding, the harvest is still poor. Statistics on the cocoon production in the four villages show that although there are five to six-tenths of a yield, the cocoon quality is poor, and only about 30% is suitable for the sales channels of silk factories. Cocoons have been successively weighed in each road cocoon bank, but the amount received by each bank is limited. Now all the fresh cocoons received are dried and hired to be transported to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' silk market in this port became even more sluggish. Charlean Japanese silk flooded the market, and sales were quite forceful. New York, however, due to the stock market crash, silk sales in various silk weaving factories were stagnant. Silk telegrams yesterday did not change, and the market atmosphere was sluggish. The silk market was completely stalled.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market transactions suddenly became quiet. Zhenmei green tea from the coming road village, except for the core-extracted goods which sold slightly, the rest was sluggish. The general market also stopped again. There were no major transactions of Zhenmei, Xiumei and other goods. The market was quite a picture of total failure. However, since the Association's market yesterday, preparations have been made for action on the black teas of Lianghu Qining. Public apprehension has been slightly lessened.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth market in this factory was slightly weak yesterday, especially the fine cloth, which was the softest. The reason for this was the sluggish actual sales, and the factory offered a large batch of it, Blue Chicken offered 1,500 pieces, priced at 6 taels and 5 qian and a half, and the forward months of January, February, March and April, Caiqiu Yanghe Blue Double Fish etc. were all priced at around 6 taels and 8 qian, amounting to 4,000 to 5,000 pieces, with the same forward dates, so public apprehension suddenly increased. Spot goods fell across the board yesterday, by 5 cents, Blue Flying Fish was at 7 taels 1 qian and 2.5 fen, Caiqiu at 6 taels and 8 qian and a half, and Yanghe at 6 taels 8 qian and 2.5 fen. Among the coarse cloth, Sanlu and SanTu continued to rise, yesterday costing 4 taels and 9 qian, but Ren Zhong was still at 4 taels and 7 qian and a half, and fine twill has risen all the more, Yanghe has reached 7 taels 3 qian and 2.5 fen, and Blue Double Fish 6 taels 9 qian and 7.5 fen.</p>
<p>The East-West Pingtou Market was still firm yesterday, but East goods had risen too quickly for several days, and actual sales were slightly sluggish. Qingdao and Tianjin gangs had somewhat come to an end. Yesterday, only flower straight tribute woolen cloth and floral patterns had some transactions. The trend of Sichuan Gang's big flower Yuehua velvet turned brisk, with telegrams adding more than 100 pieces in demand, so it continued to rise by 2.5 cents. Yesterday, Da Ji Long and Tianshang Qi Ba were sold for 2 qian and 7 li and a half, and White Peony sold out at 2 qian and 5 li, Huimei Pique also rose yesterday, Huxinting Da Huiwen already requires 2 qian and 5 fen and 2.5 li, Boat Beauty 2 qian and 5 fen, and Lieyan Xiao Jiawen sold out at 2 qian and 7 fen.

<p>The East white iron market suddenly rose by two to three cents yesterday. It is estimated that a 3'7" sheet is worth 1 tael and 1 qian and 4 fen, and a 3'6" sheet 9 qian and 1 fen. It is said that this price increase is actually because the East exchange rate is fixed and unchanged, and that arrivals are few and prices are high, and there is also some impact from this. However, upon hearing this news, the Ke gangs scrambled to buy spot goods, in order to prevent prices from rising again. It is said that 6,000 to 7,000 sheets have already been offered for sale yesterday, and those buying were the gangs in the Yangtze River inland and Fujian, and in addition the Nanjing Hangjiahu gangs also bought a sprinkling.</p>

<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>Sowing Seeds in the Desert</p>
<p>Sowing seeds in the desert? Who in the world would do such a thing? Gull (Note) says, "Sowing seeds in the desert is a great undertaking because it is difficult, and therefore the cause is great and necessary."</p>
<p>How dare we accept such praise? We only wish to be a part of humanity, to dedicate ourselves to art, to fulfill a small part of our responsibility to our culturally backward nation, struggling with our own suffering, and sowing a few seeds here and there. Moreover, the deformed society often disappoints, disheartens, and even corrupts many sincere workers...</p>
<p>The emptiness of the content of this Harbin city, which is merely decorated with a magnificent exterior, will disappoint you as if you had stepped into an empty tomb that has been excavated.</p>
<p>Although those buildings stand tall, apart from the stores that are piled high with imported foreign goods, what about the cultural associations, libraries...? Of course, they also support some diners. There are also many secondary schools and higher schools, which accommodate many young people... In short, everything is just a decoration on the outside. Moreover, the cultural association is run by the Japanese. The so-called Sino-Russian joint industrial university is staffed by Russian professors, and all courses are printed in Russian. Naturally, it is not surprising that an industrial university student once asked someone, "Do universities in China, such as those in Beijing and Shanghai, use Chinese textbooks?"</p>
<p>Harbin's lack of cultural development has its reasons. In the past, it was a Russian concession, and all facilities were Russian. If there was culture, it was Russian culture. The concession was taken back. It is said that in the past two years, there has indeed been more cultural development, but everything is empty and not progressing... The reason is the political oppression and the practitioners' deception and selfishness towards the cause.</p>
<p>Engaging in cultural undertakings in Harbin is indeed urgently needed, and what is needed is enlightenment work, starting from sowing seeds. Gull says, "Harbin's culture is so desolate, especially the literary and artistic circles, which are simply still in the wilderness, in the desert. However, sowing seeds in the desert..." Naturally, we are starting to cultivate this wilderness, sowing seeds in this desert.</p>
<p>I am very happy that I have wandered far away to the frontier, and it is not entirely useless, but at the same time I feel ashamed. Is what I know enough to teach others? How should I cautiously strive?</p>
<p>"Comrades, let's all work hard, work hard for culture, and create a glorious responsibility for all the backward nations, which rests on our shoulders!"</p>
<p>The first time I met a group of young art students of my age, I said this to them.</p>
<p>(Note) Gull is a newly acquainted friend after touring the north. He is a Cantonese expatriate living in Harbin.</p>

<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Jiaotong University Female Students Newly Moved Dormitory Distance Too Far Practice Racing</p>
<p>The female dormitory of Jiaotong University was originally in a two-story foreign house. Although the foreign house was not large, it was beautifully constructed and was the former residence of the president. Moreover, the number of female students was not large (only sixteen in the previous semester), so it was suitable for living in. After the start of this semester, the school authorities, because the president's family had to move into the school and it was inconvenient for the female students to occupy the president's residence, and the number of female students had increased this semester, the original dormitory felt very cramped. The Department of Training and Education repeatedly planned, but could not find a suitable place, because the planned South Court was still borrowed by the Nanyang Model Primary and Secondary School. Later, it was decided to move the faculty and staff in the East Dormitory to the remaining fifteen rooms in Zhixin West Hall (Zhixin West Hall was occupied by the third and fourth grades of the school, and was luxuriously built, with fifteen rooms vacant this semester), and move all the female students into the East Dormitory. The East Dormitory faces a small stream in front and vacant land in the back (South Court Playground). The freshness of the air goes without saying. Moreover, the house is a Western-style new building originally built by the family of Sheng, a student of the school's primary school, specifically for his son to live in. After his son dropped out of school, he donated it to the school, so it is extraordinarily beautiful and has a small playground where one can exercise a little. Because it is located in the eastern corner, there are very few students coming and going, so one can play freely, unlike the shyness of being under the gaze of male students before. However, although the East Dormitory has many advantages, it is not without its shortcomings. Because the East Dormitory is located in the eastern corner, it is very far from the Middle Court and Upper Court (where the classrooms are located), and even further from the laboratory and radio station. It takes a lot of time to go back and forth to the dormitory after class, and it is definitely not possible to go back and forth in the ten-minute break. Therefore, in order to adapt to the environment, the female students had to implement a running plan. Every time after class, a group of women in long robes and short hair were seen running in a line on the playground, with neat steps and not slow speed. From a distance, it looked like swallows flying across the sky. In an instant, the large playground had been crossed. After crossing the playground, there was still a distance of five hundred meters. In total, from the Middle Court to the dormitory, it was about six hundred and fifty meters. Starting from the Upper Court, it was even further. Therefore, female students have to run at least 1,300 meters each time they return to the dormitory. It is said that a female student in the school who is good at sports said that if this continues, all the female students in the school will become long-distance runners. However, a few students bought bicycles to replace walking, which can also create a new record for riding bicycles, it is said.</p>

It is a pity that each film she has starred in has not fully shown her strengths.

The film has a considerable position in the domestic films, especially as a work that opens up a new aspect of love films, etc.</p>
