<p>時評</p>
<h3>今後之殖民地</h3>
<p>今後各强國之殖民地。苟不改變其政策。而與以充分之自由者。必將紛擾無寗日。而兩方均受其害。蓋人與人之當以平等相待遇。人類之準則也。不以平等待遇。而視爲被征服者。同此人心。何豈能甘故此種心理。不發動則已。一經發動。非達到其目的不止。試觀印度之人民。再接再厲。不稍撓屈。蓋可知也。有殖民地之强國。如能早有覺悟。及早改變其政策。恢復其獨立自立。并於其範圍之内扶助之。俾得整理而興盛。則覊勒雖去。而友好轉深。爲同處於世界中之一與國。亦未嘗無利。以視互相仇視。日夕爭鬥而防範者。奚啻霄壤。世間少一爭端。即人類多延一殘喘。以常理論之。果何爲而不如是也。</p>
<p>然而人類之積習。每忸於故常。非至力竭智盡之日。斷不肯舍去其旣得之權利。故人即萬不能不爭。而己亦萬不肯不守。縱使爭守至於兩敗俱傷。同歸於盡。亦所情願。若使因退讓之故。而兩蒙其益。雖有一二理想之人。或作是說。而决不能見諸實事也。殖民地之爭擾。此問題斷非一時所能解决也。</p>

<h3>男排球菲日第一次賽</h3>
<p>二對○菲勝（許民輝）</p>
<p>東（京通訉）二十四日女子比賽旣畢、暫停片刻即繼以男子、報名也擇塲也、各種手續旣備鐘鳴二下、銀角一鳴、兩軍開始角逐、</p>
<h3>第一局……菲初獲勝</h3>
<p>第一局菲隊首先攻擊、第一名大將發球、衝過日陣、日隊還擊、經兩三回合、日軍雖勇猛、各個技藝頗佳、然究屬初進、一臨大敵、陣脚散亂、隊員有不知如何措手足者、故爲菲隊所乘、連得兩分、日軍中拚命將球奪回、兩軍塵戰三四回合、你來我往、雖經四次發球、日隊仍屬零分、　隊雖有宿將、然亦無甚進展、日軍至此秩序漸佳、軍容亦頗有可觀採用升東擊西之法、一二次、頗見功效、菲軍知敵戰策下、令長將軍山筆道、（以其身高而手長故名、）嚴守邊關、日人究竞新手、自菲島下戒嚴令、即不能越雷池一步、屢次劈擊、均爲長將軍個人關門、兩隊爾攻我守、彼擊此攩、頗有可觀、奮鬥成績、甚爲接近、結果菲隊以二十一比十八獲勝、旣經熱烈奮鬥、終歸失敗、</p>
<h3>第二局……日方再敗</h3>
<p>第二局日人再鼓其餘勇、以冀挽回殘局、其始也聲勢汹汹、連戰皆捷客軍見勢不佳、亦以全力禦敵、互相爭抗、不相上下、至十三分時、成績相等、及至十四分時、成績又不相上下、惟自此以後、日軍一蹶不振、戰鬥能力盡失、無復得分之希望、結果仍爲二十一比十四、此戰乃告終、統觀此賽日人球藝確已大有進步各個技術、頗有可觀、對於佈陣攻守方法、雖略有練習、惟未見純熟、大欠經騐、此其所以失敗之大原因也、菲隊此次雖獲勝、然其球藝平平無奇、宿將頗多、故經騐甚富、全隊主力、集中中網長將軍一人、此君身高手長、劈近網球最爲得手、「順球」過網、亦百發百中、太多分數、皆爲此君所得、且對隊劈球時、個人關門、大建奇功、誠爲菲隊之柱石也、</p>
<p>此外右網頗活潑關門亦頗有功、二路中將劈球頗好、維菲隊戰策、注重二路舉球、中網劈球、此爲菲島唯一取分方法、故二路中劈球之機會極少、其他隊員、有英雄無用武之地之嘆、全隊而論、救球工夫純熟經騐甚富、臨陣不驚、此其所長也、</p>
<p>由此觀之吾國排球甚有希望、倘能將一路之左右二將、集於網中、監視長將軍、不可使之越雷池一步、則菲隊得分之機會必少、此我隊應取之守法也、至於攻法、則宜注重右翼集擊、不必用升東擊西之法蓋此法不穏、恐弄巧反拙、又蹈第七次遠東運動之轍也、倘對方集中左網時、則可變換左翼集擊、亦可用交換左右翼攻擊方法、使對方照顧不暇、令其中網頻於奔走、一則可以减少其抵抗能力、同時亦可以使其長將軍身疲力倦、削减其攻擊能力、倘能言行此策、則以吾爲錦標不難到手　、</p>
<p>第一次中菲男排球賽</p>
<p>二對○……菲勝中（許民輝）</p>
<p>（東京通訊）中菲第一次男子排球賽、於二十六日下午舉行觀衆以爲遠東排球賽、莫不以此幕爲最重要之關鍵故雖經大雨、展期至三時四十分始舉行、然參觀者仍異常擁擠、以菲日賽、及平素練習測之、中隊技能上頗能占優勢、然菲隊亦是久戰遠東之士、其經騐也鎭靜也、亦未可看輕、</p>
<h3>（一）第一局情形</h3>
<p>銀角一聲、兩軍接戰中華隊聲勢洶洶、連得二分、未幾菲隊亦得一分於是互有出入、爾來我往、至徐亨發球時、連得四分、菲隊又趕上二分、李福申又加上一分、比數遂成十與六、菲隊三路右翼、發球猛烈、連取四分遂與中隊分數平等、華再一努力、又得一分、乃以十一分占先易地再戰伍永欽取得二分、而菲隊三路左翼又趕上三分、全塲空氣乃更緊張、中華後援隊、連連打氣不已、兩隊愈努力奮鬥、互相劈擊關門、菲長將軍屢欲取分惟被中隊黎徐監視、每次劈球順球均不得利、幸同隊救球敏捷、不至於失敗、乃變換戰策、而注重左右翼劈球法、至二路中發球時連得三分、中隊見勢不佳、乃改變陣勢以禦敵、敵氣稍殺、陳錫炳發球奪回兩分菲隊陣勢時有變易、或用兩翼包抄或用中網劈擊、中隊深知敵計、早爲預防、故其計亦不能受、菲隊雖以十八與十三之比、然至是亦毫無進展、黎連楹發球時、陳錫炳連劈數球、菲隊陣勢大亂、黎乘機快速發球、敵心慌亂竟爲之連獲五分、比數爲十八與十八之比、菲隊遂宣佈停戰、討論禦敵方法、亦使軍心得以鎭靜續戰之時、果將黎打退兩軍相抗良久傍觀呐喊助威、個個咬牙切齒恨不能加入戰團、以助其成功也中華隊至徐亨又得一分、呐喊之聲愈響、惟菲隊左網於此時連獲二分、啦啦之聲又大起中華中華之聲亦隨之李福申亦得一分比數遂成二十平等、兩隊至此均焦急萬分、戰戰兢兢、你劈我擋、你關門、我救起、殺得興高彩烈、全局以此爲焦點兩隊未得分數者數次、最後爲菲隊之三路中連得兩分、第一局二十二比二十乃爲菲隊所得、</p>
<h3>（二）第二局戰况</h3>
<p>休息時間、我隊開軍事會議、乃調二路左翼攻城大將人塲、時雖負一局、然自豪之氣不衰、深信此戰必獲最後之勝利即無疑、豈料第二局開始、即遭失利、連爲菲三路左翼得三分、我隊曹廷贊奮勇獲得一分、球又爲菲島奪去、其二路右翼連得三分、我隊陳錫炳爭回二分、彼二路中又獲三分、二路左翼又得一分、我隊往返多次、均未進點數、朱黎徐均空手而返、至菲島長子始獲一分、遂成十一與三之比、傍觀者大爲失望、後援趕快打氣、菲長子又獲一分、幸丘廣燮之左翼包抄、屢建奇功、陳錫炳之右路進攻、亦頗得手、菲隊着着失敗、將士死亡、不計其數、我軍陳從超、乘機猛進、連勝三分、丘廣燮·曹廷贊·陳錫炳·亦猛力撲敵、各得一分、朱祖成·更勇不可當·衝破敵陣、連得四分是役也、我隊賴兩翼包抄之法、使敵人顧左失右、顧此失彼、加以飛將軍（曹廷贊）至此乃大發虎威、敵人聞聲喪胆、故連獲十分、自十二比三、一躍而爲十三平等、當時人心奮發、土氣激昂、不言而喩矣、惜後衛空虚、屢爲敵人所乘、或左、或右、或前、或後、弄得我後衛三人、左顚右撲、仍無救藥、此　經雨後鞋滑、步伐不靈、然未始非吾隊之弱點也、自此我隊進攻力忽然降下、菲隊又以大舉攻擊、屢乘吾弱點而取分、紀錄板上、高懸十九與十五比菲軍大勝、我軍乃大整隊伍、力謀最後勝利、雅聲嘶力竭、亦不過只能擋其兩仗、至丘廣變時、小有勝利、然卒難免爲菲大壓迫、比數爲二十一比十七菲島勝、戰局乃告終、</p>
<h3>（三）球藝槪評</h3>
<p>此賽也、菲島長將軍屢劈屢順、均遭失敗、故其始也、無能進展乃變更戰策、亦用左右包抄、連得十分、此後雜用網順網劈、卒獲勝利、菲隊之救球、遠勝我隊此不能諱也</p>
<p>吾隊深知菲長將軍之利害、特以徐亨守網以監視之、蓋徐亦身高手長之戰將也更以伍永欽爲二路以救球、徐君頗有奸處、監視長子亦頗得法惟伍君劈球大不如丘、　得不償失、後　　換、丘君屢立奇功、此明證也、兩路　擊、雖略採行、惟陳錫炳之劈球、其位置與曹廷　相同、故右面不如左面成功、蓋敵人一人當中、則可監視陳曹二者、且二人常有相爭相讓之弊、此或曹廷贊不能起其飛脚之原因也、吾隊三路、實爲全隊弱點、可謂進攻有餘、保守不足、此其失敗之原因也、</p>

<p>二比○……日勝中</p>
<p>（東京通訉）遠東運動大會第二日、（二十五日）下午一時中日女子排球表演、我國選手昨日載勝菲力濱之餘威猶在日本軍對之極爲愼重、首由日本隊瀨戶智惠子女士發球、因我軍分在向西之一邊、日軍利用初夏太陽光線、屢發高角度之球、致我軍瞄的不準、無從施展其技至日本得了十一點時換邊、仍由日軍繼續發球、我軍固在背太陽方面、果然頓轉爲優勢、瀨戶之來球、被我選手蕭慧靈女士一擊奪回、由鄧志豪女士發球、惟我軍因前半挫折太過、其氣已餒、竟難得手、第一盤遂完全失敗、</p>
<p>第二盤仍由日軍先發球、至日軍得了十三點時、蕭慧靈女士發球、連得三點、大有轉機、應援隊亦歡聲沸騰、畢竟日本實力雄厚、穏健敏銳、兩得其宜、其後我軍雖又奪得一點、但大勢已去、士氣不振、結果二十一對四、日軍獲勝　惟就個人之技能論、我軍實多優秀份子、若能從此切實練習或不難收勝於將來、</p>

<h3>第一次中菲籃戰</h3>
<p>菲以三十九比三十四勝中</p>
<p>中華敗於日菲錦標已失望</p>
<p>二十五日晚七時半、中菲籃球第一次交鋒、不料我隊復以三十四對三十九失敗於菲、出征二次、一敗於日、二敗於菲、故籃球錦標、多半無望、國人　以謂此次籃球有把握、不料其不經戰也、如此南開五虎之名譽、於是掃地無餘、是晚之戰、就實力而論、菲軍確比我强、合作及擲球之準確、好到十分、我隊上半時、尙能支持、下半時、錯誤百出、籃下擲機會甚多、均未中的、劉建常唐寳琨拼命遠射、亦無一命中、幸菲方被罰甚多、否則紀錄决不至若是接近、但是晚我隊王錫良未出塲、代以陸鐘恩、陸恒喜個人出風頭、拼命拍球前進、坐失良機、茲將交戰經過詳述如下、</p>
<p>勝負不分　開戰之第二分鐘、菲軍夫羅米諾、由左邊遠射中一球、首開紀錄、我隊劉建常亦攻進一球還他顔色、未幾、菲軍右衛格羅斯遠攻一球成二對四、菲隊佔先、其後雙方互相追逐、但始終爲菲隊居多、前半時最后之一刹那間、劉建常籃下、擲得二分、前半時結果、遂爲十九對十九、勝負不分、當時菲之第三號最健將夫羅米諾因受傷出塲、亦受影響不少、</p>
<p>坐失良機　檸檬時間後、菲健將夫羅米諾又登塲、我隊努力攻擊、劉建常首開紀錄、攻人一球陸鐘恩繼之、亦攻得一球、於是成二十三對十九、我隊得勢、茲後雙方接戰、更爲激烈、雙方拉拉隊大打其氣、戰爭亦愈來愈勇、塲中空氣、異常緊張、迅速敏捷、雙方傳遞之清晰、較諸</p>
<h3>日本游泳選手躍水神情</h3>
<p>中日之戰、高出　　亦之　華、决非僥倖、　　最后紀錄、爲三十對二十六我國勝時、尙有八分鐘、不料陸鐘　李國　連罰二次、且菲方擲中之球、亦均計算、前後相差之八分、大勢已去、遂不能挽回、陸李坐失良機、傷哉、旋李國琛被罰四次出塲、代以劉冠軍、亦無濟於事、總分三十九對三十四、菲勝、下半時二十對十五、菲勝、</p>

<h3>中華棒球初賽勝菲</h3>
<p>九與六之比</p>
<p>奇計襲敵造成勝因</p>
<p>失策頗多美中不足</p>
<p>（東京通訉）中華對菲列濱之棒球初賽、於二十四日下午二時三十分、在神宫棒球塲舉行、由遠東會會長岸清一博土行始球式、球審天知壘審横澤錢村新田菲軍先攻、茲將比賽經過、略記如左、</p>
<p>中華隊因擲手程觀炳善投球急有力、且多變化、故菲軍自第一局至第四局、均倒戈而枕、毫無所得、反之我隊一帆順風、首局張榮安登塲一擊、球遠飛左翼敵人、追捉不及、乘勢進佔二壘、隨後妙用奇計、先舉一點、適時强攻、更增一分、菲隊即換擲手、惟我軍已早佔先利矣、第三局、我隊一死後、健將三人、奮起連獲安打、造成滿壘之絶好機會、强打者何東漢不幸脚脚部喫死球、遂弗勞而獲一分局面、尙形多利、只因後繼乏力、不得增加多點、诚可惜也、第五局、我軍外野守備、偶爾疏忽、致送一分與菲、第六局、菲乘勢銳攻更取一分、惟我隊毫不相讓、借敵失進壘用奇策、馬到成功、連加兩點、戰况頗呈樂觀、不料第七局、頓陷苦境、菲軍雖有兩人進壘、但已二死、方謂必無意外、乃游擊手、因欲封殺敵人、一時焦急暴投、枉送一分是後菲又獲二壘打、增多兩分、造成同點、令人急煞、僥倖我軍、反攻氣銳、敵又多失一舉、奪還四點局面、始得安定、第八局、鐘友調任擲手、菲軍雖有滿壘好機、惟鍾友不慌不忙、連把敵人殺退、第九局、菲掉尾奮戰、獲取一分、爲時晚矣無濟於事結果我隊卒以九比六大勝</p>

<p>（中）李杏花李牡丹對（菲）加利雅雅各約（mi　s　careaga）（min　yngayo）</p>
<h3>（一）男子日菲錦標賽</h3>
<p>（東京二日通訊）遠東網球第二日的主要戰爲日山岸與志村對菲阿納根（aragon）與雅各約（yngayo）之雙打、結果日以六對一、六對四、六對三獲勝、日菲對抗五塲、中日已於今昨兩日博得三勝、即已獲得與第八回錦標保持者之我國决賽之權矣、</p>
<p>二十五日午後一時二十分開始比賽、阿納極氏首先開球、以全失輸一盤、第二盤志村雖開球屢失、而日仍獲勝、成二對零之局、菲隊在第一局中、僅得第三盤、一赢全由雅各約按球之功、繼又全失一盤、終以六對一敗北、</p>
<p>第二局、兩隊靡戰至烈、阿納根表演甚佳、日方以志村之屢次失敗、於高球幾有不支之勢、開始後、日菲各勝一盤、第三盤中、阿納根有極好之兩射擊、使日隊莫知可措、以後一勝一負、彼此進攻、至急而烈、最後日隊連勝四盤、第二局遂以六對四告終、</p>
<p>第三局開始、志材開球欠準確、又多次落網、菲隊因以二對零　前、但不幸雅各約屢有不準確之猛射、致連負五盤、變成五對二日勝之局、然後菲日各得一盤、一塲惡戰、遂告完畢、</p>
<p>在此次戰中、以個人技術而論、菲隊迭在日選手之上、而尤以阿納根之抽球、旁射車著成効、但仍不能免於慘敗者、則缺於連絡合作之功夫也、反觀日隊、則個人技術上、實難有戰勝、菲隊之可能志村之屢屢失敗於開球及高球、已足置日本於百收之地位、即謂山岸表演較好、亦莫及阿納根多多、而終得最後之勝利者、是一點合作之長而已、</p>
<h3>水球表演</h3>
<h3>（二）女子中菲表演賽</h3>
<p>中對菲之女子雙打、因雨中止、中對菲女子雙打爭鬥至烈、李氏姊妹表演甚好、牡丹之急射、杏花之救球、特具功夫、菲方以加利雅較優、雅各約女士之近網球、亦殊不惡、兩隊中我國的合作工夫、略勝一籌、</p>
<p>菲雅各約首先開球、即勝一盤、第二盤李杏花亦以開球獲勝、第三盤我雖以全敗見輸、但又連勝四五兩盤、第六盤完畢、成三對三之比、繼賴杏花女士之安全打法、造成我以二盤優勝之局、方　在此五對三之比、第一局非我莫屬矣、詎知加氏處此非常不利之境、遇時竟一鼓作氣、連得二盤、在這勢均力敵惡戰臨頭之際、不助美的天公、忽然大雨傾盆、使得四位女將、不得不暫時收旗、息鼓留着五對五的戰績等候、明日再决雌雄、</p>

<h3>留美學生談盧楚寳</h3>
<p>某君留美歸來述其感想。多爲他人所未道。用特誌之。以爲留心世界大勢者告。以未得羣諾。姑略其姓氏。下即君之言也。</p>
<p>余因回國之便迂道歐洲。鬯遊各國。歷時凡三月半。行色怱怱。雖未及詳盡然烟雲過眼。不無印象也。</p>
<p>留學生歸國。必盛稱其所留學國之如何盛壯。聲色俱佳。一若欲使中國亦如是而後快。其實大謬。余留美三年。隨地留察。祗有驚奇而舌撟不能下。不但中國不能學美國。即歐洲各國。亦追趕不上。</p>
<p>美國富甲寰宇。故其文明。無非以金錢換來。創一業興一工。億萬金錢。隨手而至。在在顯其富的色采。空中有交通。地底有交通。一層不足。更有二層。大有「大爺有的是錢。不怕萬事不到手。」之慨故歐洲各國。尙望之而汗下。遑論國亂民貧之中華耶。</p>
<p>歐洲古蹟甚夥。美洲以歷史淺近。固無所謂古也。英國博物院中。有一金鋼鑽。直徑可三寸許。如一大饅頭。耀眼生纈不能逼視。</p>
<p>歐戰四年。德國境内並無鉅大損失。無非在鄰境上操演一回耳。泊其自知兵臨城下。禍及眉睫。乃議和約。戰後。賠欵至鉅。自知無力償還。乃精製物品。供給世用。以製品作金錢。藉償鉅欵。故英法美等國。知德有此出品。往往不再自製。其言曰。德人已爲我製備。無須勞力也。</p>
<h3>誌普陀之土蛇子逸梅</h3>
<p>普陀孤懸海中。山麓多草木蒙籠蓊蔚。爲蛇類所蟠處然。山僧奉佛戒。禁止殺生。人不犯蛇。蛇亦相安不妄肆毒。蛇産卵。偶爲風濤所捲。入瀢　硉矹間。海中有鯢。一名山椒魚爲兩棲類之最大者。體微温。蓋熱血動物也。鯢附硉矹游行。觸及蛇卵。經若干次。則破卵而出小魚。俗稱土蛇子。上海影戲公司諸職演員。日前赴普陀攝「美人島」影片。於金沙灘畔捕得其一。山僧再三囑毋烹啖。謂是魚毒甚。啖之毒發能裂腸胃。且爲述是魚之來歷。諸職演員因裝之酒精瓶中。携之以還。予覩之。長祇二三寸。體作髓圓形。腹白。背蒼黑。斑斑然。尾絶小。目微翳。無鱗而爲尖刺刺。中出黏滑之汁。乃毒液也。據云是魚不常有。蛇卵捲入濤石間。往往碎損不完。即完卵矣。不得鯢體之附。亦不能生。否則毒物充斥。即同類之魚。亦無幸云。</p>
<p>戰後協約國限制德國至嚴。防其死灰復燃。然德人毅力堅强。恒於無可努力中。猶潛心求進取。故英法等國。亦惟有側目而已。</p>
<p>怪余個人觀察而得。無論何種商業。無論可國政治。總不能免除黑幕二字。美國某次造一地道。建築家之投標者甚衆。某公司標價溢出一百餘萬。竟獲選。蓋曾賄工程師以三百萬金之鉅。其後事露。舉國盡知。</p>
<p>歐洲中有數小國。其貧乏不亞吾國。但其國内人民敎育程度普遍。故不至於滅亡也。</p>
<p>中國今日而欲强盛。惟有取法乎歐洲。歐洲中惟德國爲良好模範。畫虎不成反類犬。若乎學美不成。則不堪言矣。首都中山大道。即學美之錯誤者。歐人築路其初本爲石子。寖假而兩旁加澆柏油。因而逐漸改。良非一蹴而得者但甲路已成乙路亦築務求普及。决無相去過遠之怪象。今中山路初時何等壯美。但建築容易。養路艱難。日久失修。遂至不可收拾。况首都除一中山路外。至今仍未見其良好道路耶。長此以往。惟有成者無錢修。未成者無錢建耳</p>
<h3>歸途聞見錄談麗章</h3>
<p>作客申江于焉數載。一年一度。作歸省計。客歲一病兼旬。久曠職守。遂併一度之歸。亦付闕如。慈母切倚閭之望。孺子企白雲之思。時屆孟夏草木向榮。聽子規聲聲。不如歸去。頓興蓴鱸之思。月之中旬。束裝就道。爰將歸途見聞。筆而出之。聊誌雪泥鴻爪云爾。</p>
<p>久客塵囂之滬上。終日車聲轔轔。喧闐雜沓。不可名狀車離北站。推窗遠眺。微風拂面。綠草如茵農夫操作田疇。鳴其天籟之歌聲。以節勞倦。間有一二牧童。横騎牛背。點綴其間。不翅天然圖畫。是時心曠神怡。胸襟舒鬯。俗塵滌盪無餘。車中人與車外人。各樂其樂。誠不知前綫烽火連天。砲聲匝地。尙有我宛轉吟呻。求生不得之同胞否耶。</p>
<p>車抵梁溪。時已向暮。檢點行囊。欵段出站。梁溪爲舊遊之地。覓定新世界旅舍後。環遊馬路。獨行踽踽。百無聊賴。後聞舊雨周君。亦寓斯社。交臂失之。頗滋惆悵。翌日購票登輪。幸遇同鄉楊君。清談娓娓。以遣永晝。舟抵西汎家鄉咫尺。衡宇在望。喜溢眉宇。西汎爲陽羨大澤。周圍數十里。浩瀚無涯。兼之春雨連綿。河水泛濫。時近黄昏。夕暉斜掛林梢。出立船首極目遠眺。烟波四合。暮靄蒼蒼。浮鷗點點。帆影上下。容與中流。時日已非此景如昨。頗興日月催人。時不我與之感。倐怱里門入眼。久客歸來。中心反覺忐忑不寗。個中况味。惟身受者知之耳。予家庽陽羨西鄙。離鄉兩載。情境全非。蕭條衰頽。凄凉滿目。至友戴家榖。李瀛洲等。咸來過訪。據云。客歲地方經蝗蟲過境。田禾蹂躪泰半。兼之旱魃爲虐。秋收遂成絶望。弱者固轉乎溝壑。强者乃挺而走險。復經會匪鼓動。一人揭竿。衆人和之。擾攘數月。方告敉平。然至今猶萑苻不靜。地方經一再斵傷。民生凋敝。不堪名狀。米價昻貴至十六元五角。於是富者貧。而貧者乃至饔飱不繼。未幾。有某木舖。一家八口。斧鑿所入。以維生計。今歲四鄉。謀食不遑更無餘資。再置農具。影響所及。乃室無餘粒。灶絶炊烟。日以紅花草聊充枵腹。若至珮黄不接之時。將何以堪。地方耆紳楊梅生。及商界巨子李慕之戴培因等。發起平糶。然杯水車薪。無濟於事。聞之錫紳榮君。以哀鴻遍野。戔戔者貧民受惠至鮮。擬備榖賑濟。乃委一徐君。來鄉調查災民戶口。詎知略一檢點。斷炊者竟至三萬餘戶。卒至愛莫能助。暫作罷論。然嗷嗷者尙延頸株守以望也。</p>
<h3>遊玉佛寺歸來馬恊衷</h3>
<p>月之朔日爲紗市交易所理事柳芝庭君太夫人九旬冥誕之期。假座戈登路玉佛寺禮懺。上午十時前。余偕趙南煌君等前往參拜。寺内僧舍幽闊。點綴頗雅。階下松柏蒼翠花草繽紛。清香醉人心骨。入大雄寳殿。佛祖曁諸羅漢之偶像。金光燦爛偉然矗立。轉入後廳。陳設精緻。四壁多名人墨跡之楹聨詩句而古畫數幅。筆力蒼勁。尤爲稀有。令人觀之神王。嗣由右首登樓。見冠纓下垂之玉佛一尊。巍然高坐於紅櫃之中。據云係由緬甸採來之眞玉。價值在三萬金以上。然古語白玉無瑕。觀其黑點斑斑。殆非純玉。余愧無卞和之才。未敢妄加臆斷也。該寺佛殿巍峨。建築雖宏麗。惜無天然風景。供人流連。似較吾鄉依山挾水風景天然之金山寺。殊有愧色。余等一行共七人。周覽全寺後。有三人加入方城之戲。余於枯坐無聊之際因有所感。按我國貧弱之原因。由於生産者寡。食之者衆。加之戰禍頻年。天災肆虐國内農業凋弊。民不聊生。而一般祇善消費不能生産之僧尼。反得飽食暖衣。怡然自適。前國府雖有打倒迷信廢除僧尼之命令。至今未能澈底實行。致牛山濯濯之秃頭同胞。依然高枕無憂。享其清閒之福。僅就玉佛一寺而言。建築費及廟産等。總計約值二十萬金以上。如以之改造工廠。强迫原有僧衆改操勞工生涯。使社會一部份失業者。有工作機會。未始非策也。</p>

<h3>程豔秋新排之全本柳迎春舜九</h3>
<p>近年以來。北平劇界爲應合潮流。競尙新劇爭妍鬥勝。美不勝收。但以新編者爲多。述古者蓋鮮。程郎艶秋有鑑於此。特煩編劇家清逸居士。編製全本柳迎春。因艶秋每演汾河灣一劇。倍承顧客歡迎。皆以未窺全豹爲憾。今特增加首尾。情節異常曲折。如天衣無縫。本末瞭然。此戲由柳員外修工覓良材演起。至汾河灣夫妻團圓止。全劇穿插共二十餘塲。其中如贈衣别母。廟會送夫。各塲情文細膩。哀抑幽怨。唱工繁重。尤見精彩。此劇純以柳迎春事迹爲主。凡薛仁貴者。槪不贅叙。故定名柳迎春。艶秋此劇。業已出演北平華樂園。以姜妙香飾前部之薛禮。王少樓飾後部之薛禮。李洪春飾柳員外。李多奎飾柳安人吳富琴飾田氏。珠聨璧合。堪稱傑構。會當與金鎖記硃痕記兩劇。齊譽海内無疑也。</p>

<p>社會消息</p>
<h3>今年新麥及麵粉之趨勢</h3>
<p>理</p>
<p>今年麥粉情形與往歲大不相同、茲新麥登塲、距期甚邇、陳貨交易、轉瞬黄花、後去之趨勢如何、亟有研究之必要、爰就管見所及、加以蠡測、儻亦爲海内關心民食者之所許、</p>
<p>「總論」今年新麥、須以四兩三錢爲底價、麵粉須以二兩三錢爲底價、中途或有一度之小面、以致打破此價、然如曇花之一現、暫而不久、可無疑義也、茲將各種理由分述於下、以資證明、</p>
<p>（一）售麥之權、操之農民、而農民售麥之標準、一以米價爲依據、今米售二十元、江北有數縣且售過三十元、如此高價、誠爲曠古未有、故今年新麥收程之豐歉、猶非重要問題、試問彼農民際茲米珠之時、誰肯將千辛萬苦汗血換來之小麥、情願以低廉之代價出售乎、且米價一時不平、吾知必有許多地方實行食麥、蓋除相近滬寗滬杭兩路一帶之同胞、較爲富庶、養成寗食貴米、不願食賤麥之習慣外、他如大江以北、及徐淮以上、皖魯等省之百姓、不特麥粉可以代米、甚至包米（玉蜀黍）紅糧（高粱子）、無一不可充飢、職是之由、今年新麥之供給斷難湧多、此論米價昻貴足以影響麥供之不湧、其理一也</p>
<p>（二）今年粉麥存貨、不論上海内地、以及南北洋各埠、皆非常枯缺、如去年今日、上海存粉常有一百餘萬包、天津常有四百餘萬包、而此時上海方面、號稱粉廠林立、供粉最多之處、已有早不保暮之槪、天津一埠、爲全國粉消之冠、據最近調查、所存麵粉、不滿百萬、比較去年相差、不可以道里計、是故一見新麥、各廠必爭先恐後、從事購辦、内地廠家、復具捷足先登之决心、因此新麥之供給、或有僧多粥少之憂、斷無貨積如山之慮、此論存貨枯缺、足以使廠方之爭購麥價、因此難賤、其理三也、</p>
<p>（三）實銷方面、自去冬以來、常吃高價之麵粉、約略統計、當在二兩五錢半左右、（合洋三元六角）然而消化力量、並不因此减少、可知二兩五錢外之麵粉、實已司空見慣、毫不足怪、至於今日之去路略鈍者、良由目前各廠所出之棧單、甚至批期交貨、遠者十餘天、近者五六天、故在此时期、縱放任何之高價、亦屬徒然、且見新在即、價比便宜、商人算盤、刻刻打算、故近日各帮、除立候應用萬不可緩外、餘皆情願株守幾日、以待新粉、此論實銷方面、不憂呆滯、其理三也、</p>
<p>（四）吾國地大物博、産麥之區、亦不爲少、所産麥額、雖無統計、定足驚人、然而不然、蓋因交通不便、運輸困難、以致大好天物、暴棄於地者有之、内戰不息、匪共猖獗、以致農民流連失所、有田不能耕種者、亦有之、是故國内所産之麥、實不足供給國内各廠全年之需用、證之歷年過去情形、此說確可成立在昔所恃者、幸賴美國及坎拿大之麥粉運華救濟、試觀海關報告、在近五年内洋粉進口、每年統計、中前一千餘萬包、今則金價奇昻、匯水騰貴、若以目前美麥運申製粉、核其成本、當在二兩八錢以上、此後匯水方面、苟無劇烈變化、欲望美坎之麥粉運華救濟、殊屬不易、此論國外麥粉、難以救濟、其理四也、</p>
<p>根據以上四種理由而推測之、則今年麥粉之價、勢必迫於逐漸上漲之一途、若國外麥粉常年不通、國内交通時生阻礙、深恐今冬明春靑黃不接之際、難免發現空前之高價新紀錄、此乃環境所逼迫、决非人力所可挽回也、或曰如君所論、則今年之麥粉、永無降落之希望、君言不將太甚乎、余對曰、降落之機會、未嘗不有、此後或因人心關係、或因空氣作用、或因一時之求不敵供、或因秋收良好之影響、曲折盤旋、忽升忽降、亦事理之常有、無足爲奇、不然、靑雲直上漲落毫無、則不成其爲市面矣、然吾人尙有一線之希望、則今年日本粉廠、大舉聨合、測其用意、無非欲推銷麵粉於吾國南北洋各埠耳、聞近日煙台威海衛等埠、已有日粉兜售之消息、誠能如此、則粉消方面、理當减色、求供之間、或趨於緩和、上述云云、亦幸而不中矣、總之、國内清平、匪氛盡掃、運輸無阻、貨物流通、斯時也、不特麥粉之價可以和平、即民生問題、亦未嘗不可從此解决也</p>
<h3>米</h3>
<p>農村生活之一</p>
<p>米這個東西、江南人是不可一日無此君的、都市中人自己不種田、把白白的袁頭和花花的鈔票去換這東西來裹腹、絲毫不知道粒粒皆辛苦、到得二十多元一石的今日、雖然也會喊一聲吃飯、難但他們又那裏知道種田的農人吃飯更難呢</p>
<p>農夫種田、田裏有米出産、有米就有飯吃、怎麽也要喊吃飯難呢、如果有人有這種發問、那末其人一定是知其一未知其二、知其表面未知其實際、時至今日、農人是眞個田裏收不着米了、蘇上一帶號稱魚米之鄉、他那裏産米的狀况、說來眞可痛心、那裏是人多田少、每一農家、平均種不滿十畝田、就算種十畝、慣例是把五畝種稻、其餘的種豆麥棉或桑樹、年來天災人禍、相逼而來、像水災雖不至遍地汪洋、盡成澤國、可是今天雨、明天雨、也會把田禾的根腐爛而死、的天早起來、水利不修、溝澮皆涸、農夫雖有戽水器具、而苦於無水可取、像去年常州一帶、祗得眼望着稻禾焦死而莫可救藥、蝗虫飛來、如百萬大軍、漫天遍野而至、自然稻禾又受損失了、最可恨的是土匪、他們横行鄉里打家刧舍、害得農民不敢家居、田疇荒蕪、就是有了稻在田、也不敢去收穫、而任他腐爛於地、因爲上面各種原因、所以米的收成弄得大减特减、或竟至於無、從前每一畝稻可以收到白米兩石三石的、現在平均能夠收到一石巳經是萬分徼幸了、五畝田共計收到五石米、試問一家八口、這區區的米那裏能夠敷衍一年呢、所以一到來年的春二三月、早已無米爲炊了、但性命要緊、不敢做辟榖仙人、餐烟霞而飲白露、結果也陪了都市中人一同買米度日、肚子固然要飽、白白的袁頭又那裏會源源而來、於是想到减飯的方法、其法維何、就是不吃飯而吃粥、因爲水無須錢去買的、飯粥又祇在厚薄之分、米裏多加些水、就得變成多量的裹腹品了、而米也就可以省却不少了、此外像麥粉芋艿及現在的靑蠶豆、也都是米的代替品、更足以痛心的、就是種了數十畝田的人家、也很多無米爲炊而要去買來吃、這是什麽緣故呢、因爲家用浩繁、無可設法、待稻剛登場便把榖賣去、或磨成了米去賣換來金錢、以應付急用、賣時正新榖上市、價值低微、待家中無米要去買來吃時、又值米少價貴、以賤價賣出、貴價買入、你說痛心不痛心呢、據調查所得、現在每個鄉村上十家之中、至少有六七家要買米裏腹、買米人如此衆多那能叫米不要貴、要貴到二十多、元一石呢、</p>
<p>鄉人旣没有米吃爲甚不把所有的田統統種稻呢發此問題的人、也是知其一而不知二、因爲有的田宜稻、有的田宜麥、宜稻的不宜麥、猶宜麥的之不宜稻也、並且人們的生活、除掉食以外、還有衣住和婚喪酬應其他一切的費用種豆種麥種棉之所得、大都售之於人以供上述各種之耗費、假使把所有的田盡種了稻、而又靠天之幸、没有什麽天災人禍、則米可多、收食的問題固可解决、不致種了田也要買米吃、然而其他的種種生活所必需之費、又從那裏來呢、</p>

<h3>世界文學的故事（一）（六）（五）美國約贛瑪西著胡仲持</h3>
<h3>第四十二章十九世紀的俄羅斯文學</h3>
<p>在我們之間、事物是取了這樣的形態、就是小說丨丨文學中的最微末最無足重輕的形式丨丨者成着這兩者之一、或則是愚劣的東西、或則是響徹帝國的指導者之聲、</p>
<h3>丨陀爾琪寗</h3>
<p>在不知俄羅斯語的西方的讀者看來、俄羅斯文學的意義是指十九世紀及現代的俄羅斯的小說而言、這是盲目於俄羅斯的詩及其他的表現形式的有限制的見解、然而在這限制、却也有十足的理由的、小說訴於廣多的人們、這較之别種文章更容易地越過國民間的國境去、而且俄羅斯的小說是有力的制度、就如引用於上面的批評家所提示似的、這是故事以上、這是不獨響徹俄羅斯帝國而已、實在也響徹歐羅巴之聲、所以使我們之忽視俄羅斯文學的其他部分丨丨縱使我們於此有着好多的知識罷丨丨顯得正當者正是俄羅斯的小說極其豐富這事實、不但如此在、偉大的小說家的時代以前、俄羅斯人從西歐羅巴有所假借、而在他們有了作爲那報酬可以貢獻的許多新的獨創的東西以前、影響的潮是向東流着的、他們從法蘭西·意大利·及英吉利得了靈感、便將他們固有的歌謠及故事的源泉棄而不顧了、</p>
<p>雖然使我們特别懐着興味者是散文的小說、近代俄羅斯文學的　創設者倒是兩個詩人、普希金及勒夢托夫、他們是也寫散文的、兩人都屬於十九世紀初葉的羅曼底時代、兩人也同歐羅巴的一半靑年作家一樣、受擺侖的强的影響、</p>
<p>普希金有着一切文學底天禀、他是抒情詩人·是劇詩人·是故事家、然而他首先第一、是有偉大的力和美的劇作家、俄羅斯的作曲家是不絶地於他那里尋求主題的根據於他的、故事和詩的最知名的歌劇是「尤金温湼金」「波利思、哥陀諾夫」「露薩爾加」及「畢克夫人」、他有偉大而且良好的影響及於他以後的一切俄羅斯文學、所以然者因爲他發展了單純的文體、或者、是帶牠而生而憑了明晰和直截獲得他那有力的效果的、</p>
<p>勒夢托夫同普希金一樣、是擺侖式底、然而他還有着雪萊的味、他是幻想家、於俄羅斯人的靈魂的神秘底·精神底性質有着興味、這種興味流行於繼起的許多文學、乃是較之任何别國的小說在俄羅斯的小說佔着優勢的特徵、勒夢托夫的主要的小說是「現代的英雄、」這是翻譯爲連英語在内的多種語言的、這是以高加索爲背景、以一種羅曼底·騎士底精神揭發那俄羅斯的紳士須得相鬭的山嶽人的德性的、在實際生活上偏袒一方縱使是怎樣的必要、但在小說上並不偏袒一方、而常見别人的性質的事丨丨這也可說是特殊地俄羅斯底、普希金及勒夢托夫這兩個指導底文學者都被殺於决鬭中、我們知道這事情便可以窺見那時代的文學及社會的狀態了、</p>
<p>棄却羅曼底因襲而求主材於人生的最初的小說的巨匠是尼高來·哥郭里他的「死靈魂」較那標題所示生動得多、以連串的冒險描着小規模的俄羅斯社會的許多樣相、充滿以對於平民的諧謔底同情和對於詐欺及僞善的諷刺底輕蔑、那諧謔有許多在翻譯中據說是失去了的、這大槪是事實罷、因爲哥郭里是小鄉村的人們的綿密的觀察家然而在英譯中、那本質底人道精神却輝耀得儘夠使我們知道那書的偉大、哥郭里在那冷嘲底觀察的天禀之外、還有着對於更激動的劇底東西的手腕、那是顯現於哥薩克兵和波蘭人的戰爭的故事「太拉斯·部爾白」之中的、然而首先第一、他是寫實主義的創設者、繼起的俄羅斯小說家縱使進步得遠過他、也承認他的優越、後代的俄羅斯小說家繼承着較之普希金毋寗哥郭里的緒統、這是可尊敬的俄羅斯的學者而往昔的革命主義者克魯泡特金的意見、無論如何在未曾中止被讀的他自身的作品、又在將小說從羅曼主義拉開、而使其和人生一致這一種努力、非批評底地被意識的努力哥郭里本是、如今也還是偉大的力、這一層却是確實的、</p>
<p>最初的大進步成就於伊凡屠格湼甫、他和杜思退益夫斯基和託爾斯泰是支配俄羅斯小說的三大巨人、屠格湼甫的最初重要的作品「獵人日記」描寫着農夫的悲慘生活、於將他們從農奴制解放的事上有相當的效果、俄羅斯的小說不單是暇豫的故事、還於生有實際底關係、這一層是旣述的、而在托爾斯泰之中則見得更顯著的事實的說明、在「父與子」中、屠格湼甫描着新興時代和舊時代間的、有科學底及智底抱負的靑年和舊式的愛家庭的貴族間的爭鬭、他使用「虚無主義」這名稱於有些新的主義、那個詞兒政府是用以汚辱一切自由思想的、那結果、屠格湼甫一時失了他所同情的人們的衆望距那時數年前、他以對於官塲的有些批評曾使政府不快、而受了短期間的監禁和流刑的懲罰、俄羅斯作家的生活是憤激和危險的生活、然而屠格湼甫、第一義地說來、並非宣傳家、他是有我們以爲法蘭西風的形式之感的藝術家、人間的研究家、愛美的人、他是也單純也深刻的、曾有人說、屠格湼甫以外、誰也没有寫過完全的小說、丨丨這是誇張的話、但若這意思是說他的小說大都差不多近於完全、則也是眞實的在「前夜」和「春潮」他描寫年靑的女性的凄哀的美、他感覺到俄羅斯人間的無聊處和殘忍處、而且理解他們的深的悲哀所以然者、因爲他自身也有着牠、他的不幸並非病底、却是勇敢而優美的他的、分析的明瞭和他的故事的淺顯使他對於世界的别部分、成爲俄羅斯的性質的恐怕最明澈的介紹者、的確他是最易讀者。他是否較偉大的同代人爲眞實、能夠告訴我們者惟有俄羅斯人而已、他的小說與其說是以弛緩而無結構的俄羅斯的範本爲根柢、毋寗說是以法蘭西的模型爲根柢、他在巴黎度了活動底生涯的大部分、杜思退益夫斯基及託爾斯泰便都以爲他法蘭西化了、或者有變到那樣的危險了、然而他却也時時回到俄羅斯來、找求新的材料、他那自尋的流刑使他成爲俄羅斯語的崇拜家、據俄羅斯人所云、則他是以最終的完全使用俄羅斯語的、他以細心的注意寫作、恐怕這是他從法蘭西人學得的一事罷、的確、法蘭西人的影響、無論對於這俄羅斯人是怎樣、却並不傷害這藝術家、而且連作爲藝術家的這俄羅斯人也並不受害、爲什麽呢、因爲只有對於自己的母國語懐一種祈願的藝術家纔能夠寫出、「這樣的語言、該不授於偉大的國民、那是想不出道理來的、」這一種意味的話的、</p>

<p>汽車新聞通用特刊</p>
<h3>通用汽車總廠駐華分行甲</h3>
<p>通用駐華分行上海推銷主任狄佛蘭著</p>
<p>美國通用汽車製造總廠。鑒於中國汽車市塲。日益重要。特設駐華分行。查近年華人均知交通改良之必要。上自政府。下至民衆。無不努力提倡路政。新鐵路之計畫各省道之興造。皆爲顯殊之表示。良以交通便利之後。各業隨之發展。一國之治安與興盛。實利賴之。道路旣日加增汽車運輸。遂爲人人所注意。汽車以迅速便利擅。長投資不多。費用較。輕美國之富强。汽車亦有功。中國交通素不發達。鐵路里數極少。今欲積極進行運輸上之便捷。惟有汽車最能收事半功。倍之效。况中國地大物博。出産豐富省與省之轉運</p>
<p>洲論。通用汽車産額。佔全美百分之三十四。易言之。每三輛汽車中。必有通用一輛。至於通用汽車出口貿易範圍亦廣大無比。目下通用汽車之市塲已佔大小一百十四國。去年通用汽車與貨車在外國銷售者。共二十五萬六千七百廿一輛。值二萬萬四千三百零四萬六千零三十一美金。照美國與坎拿大所産汽車運銷外國之總數計算。通用又佔一百之三十七左右。</p>
<p>現在中國所有之通用汽車與貨車。逾一萬輛。其中三千五百輛均於去年輸入。通用之六汽缸雪佛蘭汽車。在中國最盛行。</p>
<h3>通用學生之實習</h3>
<p>上海通用汽車學校學生在實習時之情形</p>
<p>。用汽車甚經濟。通用汽車總廠。爲世界最大之汽車公司。在汽車事業中素居首位。所出車輛種類最多。經商精神。猛進不已。對於中國汽車市塲。通用公司抱有鉅大之希望。將來通用出品在華之勢力。必大有可觀。</p>
<p>通用總廠創立於二十年前。資本初祗一千萬美金。係將别克奥斯摩别爾與卡笛拉克之汽車公司合併而成。今日之通用。與昔大不相同。資本逾三十萬萬美金。製車十二種。車名如左。</p>
<p>雪佛蘭汽車與貨車。亞貝爾寳塔克。奥斯摩别爾。華克蘭。萬金馬克德。别克。華克沙。拉薩爾。卡笛拉克。通用貨車。通用製造大宗汽車之外。兼營之他業亦多。例如福克與杜尼飛機公司美國合組無線電公司。達文科李梅電機等。通用工廠在美國者。一百家以上。工人職員不下二十五萬人。一年營業之大爲數驚人。試照去年之總數言之。計出車一百八十六萬零四百零三輛。值價十五萬萬零四百四十萬四千四百七十二美金。以北美以其售價特廉。費用極省。二者均與中國情形相宜。六汽缸雪佛蘭之售價祇與四汽缸車同。惟引擎係最新式。機力極大。速度極高。用油極省。世界各國。無不歡迎新雪佛蘭。因是一九二九年份。雪佛蘭一種共銷一百三十五萬輛之多。</p>
<p>通用總廠之偉大成績。不獨爲其所造之車。價有高下。用途廣大。且因其出品之值價在汽車中爲最高尙。通用總廠之財力。可謂富足萬分。人才方面。不問機械與科學。無不濟濟。製造上之設備。皆屬最新最精。此外又設工界第一之研究院。專事物質與製造之改良。新車造成。必先自行實地試駛爲此特闢廣袤之試車塲。抑有進者。通用汽車實行大宗出産。原料亦大宗收買。因之成本較廉。定價亦廉。售主受惠實多。</p>
<p>通用國外之推銷辦法。周到普及。各地經理設有修理站。給供主顧修換。一切服務。與在美國無異。蓋通用之服務。滿佈全球。無遠勿屆。通用分廠與分行在國外者。今有二十四處。最近又將德國亞貝爾汽車廠收併。中國方面則有駐華分行二處。一在上海專管中國中部。一在瀋陽。包括華北與東三省蒙古。中國經理及分經理。在重要大城。依次設立。服務之周。與世界各地無異。上海與瀋陽。各有存棧。通用汽車貨車現貨齊備。無定貨需時之弊。再上海另設一零件總倉。存貨值三十萬元。以供各經理隨時添補。永不缺乏。中國各地路面大都不平。汽車零件容易</p>
<h3>雪佛蘭運津</h3>
<p>天津汽車運輸事業。亦甚發達。圖爲雪佛蘭貨車一列。運到津埠。裝配完全後之攝影。</p>
<p>損壞。通用零件隨時隨時立刻可換。此與主顧方面。利便無比。駐華分行特設服務一部。主任爲專門家。襄助各地通用經理組織最新式之修理站。通用分行又在上海設有汽車學校。俾各地經理與經營通用汽車運輸事業之公私機關指派機匠來滬學習。至於宣傳方面。所印華文說明書小冊子。每年甚多。近正計畫編著標準汽車名詞一書。以期中國有統一式之專門名稱。由此觀之。通用駐華分行之設。投資頗鉅。其對於中國汽車事業前途之發展。必深信無疑可斷言者。</p>
<h3>汽車之前途樂觀吉人</h3>
<p>通用營業主任之觀察</p>
<p>汽車前途之發展。須視今日汽車所佔之地位與每年銷額之數目。始能斷定之。近年汽車事業之發達。確有一日千里之勢。即論每年各國道路哩數之增加。大有可觀。至於路政改良。亦甚急切。諸如此類。莫不增高汽車本身之價值與啓發其偉大之功用。</p>
<p>[</p>
<h3>通用滬行之樣子間</h3>
<p>美國通用汽車公司上海分行之最新樣子間。在本埠北揚子路三號。圖内之二車。即一九三十年式之新别克汽車。</p>
<p>衣食住爲人生之三大事。今第四件事則爲交通曩者吾人行動往來。探險遠征。均藉手足運行之殊感不便。自有汽車以後。對於交通運輸。便利不少。迅速無比。而人類之期望。亦因之得以滿足。</p>
<p>科學發達。可謂已至極點。此後能供獻於汽車事業者。預料必罕。雖然。汽車之功用。則將仍爲個人運輸之利器。可無異議也。</p>
<p>數年前有人以謂飛機出現後。汽車從此多一敵手，實則不然。蓋飛機之與汽車。尤無線電之與新聞紙。兩者互有聨帶關係。例如飛機翔行天空。内中乘客。大都用汽車往返接送更顯明者。即飛機與汽車之引擎組織原理彼此相仿。後者運用較易與成本較輕耳。</p>
<p>飛機事業已有二十五年。較汽車適遲十年。去歲十二個月内。各式飛機之出品總數。僅低雪佛關一日半之産額。可見汽車之需要。實勝飛機千萬倍。然以年來飛機與汽車生産額之比例率論之。則不相上下。故此兩種運輸之獲展。必可並駕齊馳</p>
<p>世界各大汽車公司。經營商業。必先熟悉各地商務詳情與其社便之需要。汽車製造家中。惟通用汽車公司確費時日。專心研究將來汽車市場之問題。考察結果。得有要則數項。足以預斷將來汽車事業之盛衰。</p>
<p>最要原則。當爲新舊車輛之交替。近來歐美諸邦。每年必廢舊車一次。以爲車務之整頓。祇以美國論之彼在三百萬輛以上。此項大宗舊車毁滅後。必須以新車替換之。在此新陳代舊之時期内。今年各廠製造新車之數額。必有意外之增加。</p>
<p>交替時期。刻已實現。在汽車史中。確爲</p>
<h3>雪佛蘭暢銷海外</h3>
<p>雪佛蘭汽車暢銷全球。上圖爲新雪佛蘭裝木箱在美國紐約上船時之情形。載運此車者即爲通用廠之通用貨車。在華每年銷路冠諸各車。可見其盛名矣。</p>
<p>一重大之變化。即論古今關於汽車功用之觀念。亦見奇異之見解。昔人視汽車爲奢侈品。見之生忌。今則不以爲然矣。汽車之重要。已由貴族物而爲人生事業之利器。現代人土對於汽車之信仰。有增無减。是以汽車之前途。未可限量。</p>
<p>家庭備置汽車之趨勢。亦因潮流而加增。致其將來之情形。未可預料。但觀近來自備汽車之數額。年有激增。扶搖直上。歐美人士之家庭。頗多一家備置二三輛汽車者。旣便家庭應用。又增門庭光輝。此汽車將來必更發達之又一緣因也。</p>
<p>當此商業競爭激烈之時。交通發展進行之際。汽車運輸。實爲一國商務之命脈。近年以來。各國汽車廠所製車輛。因此汽車之産額。破年來空前新紀錄。而運貨車之出品。因商業之需要。亦日增月新。據此推測。汽車將來之前途。未可限量。此世人必能同聲贊揚。共抱樂觀者也。</p>
<h3>雪佛蘭之鉅大産額甲</h3>
<p>一九二九年造一百三十五萬輛</p>
<p>一九二九年雪佛蘭汽車與貨車之出産總數。又見加增。比一九二八年多十五萬輛。去年産額爲一百三十五萬輛。且均爲六汽缸車。於此可見雪佛蘭之盛行。</p>
<p>去年之製造成績。每日每週以至每月。比較結果。無不超過以前紀錄。最奇者。此一百三十五萬輛客車。其中有一百萬輛</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>係在八個月内製成運出。因六汽缸之雪佛蘭第一輛。於去年一月一日開始出售。及至八月間市上已有一百萬輛之多。去年五月份雪佛蘭産額最高。計十六萬零八百六十五輛。至於近年之産額。可參考左表。以示雪佛蘭之逐年大進步。</p>
<h3>通用貨車之堅强</h3>
<p>一九三十年之通用貨車。機力更强。車身更堅每車之載重量約有五千噸。圖示上海通用汽車公司設立之汽車學校學生三十七人。均立於通用汽車之後輪上。重量共計四千九百噸。約較平常載重量加二倍。而後輪能擋之。可見通用貨車後彈簧抵抗力之强大矣。</p>
<p>一九二四年　三十萬九千輛</p>
<p>一九二五年　五十一萬輛</p>
<p>一九二六年　七十二萬八千輛</p>

<h3>The Jin Army's Counterattack on Yifeng Fails</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle for a Day and Night Repelled by the Central Army</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Gu Zhutong's telegram of the 2nd states that Sun Chu, Yang Yaofang, Zhang Huizhao, and others led their three marshals' forces to fiercely attack our Yifeng positions starting from the night of the 31st. After a fierce battle lasting a day and night, our army launched a counterattack this morning, killing many enemies. More than ten thousand guns and nineteen mountain guns were seized. The enemy has already collapsed into a disorganized army. (Special dispatch of the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Liu Zhi's telegram of the 2nd states that after the enemy attacked our positions on the 30th and was defeated by us, our army launched a fierce pursuit and annihilation. As of this morning, more than ten thousand enemies have been captured, including Ji Hongchang's pistol regiment, Sun Liangcheng's special service regiment, and Song Zheyuan's guard regiment, etc. The enemy's elite forces have suffered almost complete casualties. (Special dispatch of the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou Electric Telegram from Zhangzhuang Railway Station: The enemy army has been defeated and retreated north by the First Army Corps. (Special dispatch of the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Telegram from Guide on the 3rd: 1. Sun Liangcheng launched a full-scale attack on the 2nd, but was repelled by our army. 2. Sun Dianying, seeing Yan and Feng sitting idly by without providing assistance, pledged allegiance to the Central Government and turned against them from Bozhou. 3. Jiang, considering the hard work of the officers and soldiers at the front, specially ordered all commanders-in-chief, division commanders, and all officers and soldiers fighting at the front to be rewarded with one silver dollar each to boost morale. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a certain gentleman returning to Nanjing from the Longhai Railway line, after the Central Army captured Guide, they successively captured Xiaoba, Liuhe, Minquan, and Yejigang. On the 22nd of last month, they captured Neihuang, and on the 23rd, they attacked Yifeng. The next day, they captured Yifeng, which is only fifteen li away from Lanfeng. If Lanfeng is captured, Kaifeng will be within easy reach. The enemy has launched fierce counterattacks in recent days. On the 25th, Feng himself went to Qixian to supervise the battle, but all were repelled by our army. Currently, Lanfeng will fall sooner or later. The rebel enemy is also urgently trying to consolidate their defense of Kaifeng. Therefore, the enemy has built three lines of defense in the Zhongmu Baisha area, each line of defense has three lines of trenches, and the fortifications are extremely solid. The fighting has been extremely fierce in recent days. Every night, the roar of artillery fire from both sides can be heard clearly for dozens of miles. The enemy's supplies of food and ammunition are insufficient, so they are conscripting locally, causing popular resentment. Ammunition is also extremely scarce, so they use cannons at long range and hand grenades at close range. The hand grenades are different from ordinary ones. A wooden handle is connected to the back of the grenade, and its shape is like a hammer. Each trench is equipped with a box, containing a hundred grenades, guarded by two people who continuously throw the grenades by holding the handle. Ji Hongchang and his troops do not even have hand grenades. When our troops charge close, the enemy soldiers hold large knives and rush out of the trenches, resisting bare-bodied. Our army is advancing extremely rapidly and taking the offensive. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>

From afar, we know the hard work of the commander-in-chief, sweeping away the remnants of the rebellious forces. We eagerly await the complete pacification of the Central Plains. Another telegram said that Yan and Feng's consultations have been fruitless, which is cause for great joy. Entangling oneself like a silkworm spinning a cocoon is easily eliminated. Trying to stop a chariot with a mantis's arm cannot be spared. The power of your reputation has spread, and the rebellious hearts are already cold. We send this special telegram to express our congratulations, and we await news of victory. (Special dispatch of the 2nd)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Future Colonies</h3>
<p>If the colonial policies of the major powers are not changed, and their colonies are not granted full freedom, there will be endless disturbances, and both sides will suffer. The principle of treating people equally is a universal human standard. Not treating people equally but regarding them as conquered subjects is something that no one can willingly accept. Once such a sentiment is aroused, it will not stop until its goal is achieved. Just look at the people of India, persevering tirelessly without yielding, and you will understand. If colonial powers can awaken early, change their policies as soon as possible, restore their independence, and assist them within their own scope to organize and prosper, then although the restraint is gone, the friendship will deepen. Being a partner among nations in the world is not without benefit. This is vastly superior to mutual hostility, daily fighting, and constant vigilance. From a rational perspective, why would one not choose such a course?</p>
<p>However, human beings are creatures of habit, often clinging to the old ways. They will never relinquish their acquired rights until they are completely exhausted and out of options. Thus, people cannot avoid conflict, and individuals will never willingly give up what they possess. Even if the struggle leads to mutual destruction and complete annihilation, they will prefer it. Although some idealistic individuals may suggest that mutual concessions would benefit both sides, it is unlikely to happen in reality. The problem of colonial disputes cannot be resolved in a short period.</p>

<p>The Soviet representative from Moscow attending the Sino-Russian conference, as well as the country's newspapers, all unanimously denied the claim that the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations were interrupted because the Russian side required the Chinese side to thoroughly investigate the case, saying that such unfounded rumors were intended to undermine the Sino-Russian negotiations.

<h3>Northern Political and Party Affairs Issues</h3>
<p>Zhao Pi-lian is Still Mediating</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei Issues a Declaration</p>
<p>Jin Army Crosses the River but is Repelled</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Pi-lian has not given up his mediation efforts. In recent days, he has been in contact with Fan's representative Chen Ziyou, Sun Dianying's representative Hu Jiesan, and Ren Yingqi's representative Zhou Han, discussing the proposal to establish a government first and then resolve party affairs. The method is to first establish a preparatory office for a joint committee of military, political, and party representatives in Beiping, and then convene a meeting to form a government. Now, Chen Ziyou has come forward to invite guests, inviting the leaders of the left and right wings of the party to speak frankly and openly, asking a certain party committee to quickly abandon the party leadership and the current term, and inviting Wang to preside over the joint conference affairs, so that the military, political, and party sides can find a way out together. Otherwise, there are quite a few stable party members in terms of strength who can be driven, and they cannot delay our political lives due to one or two people with high voices. It is said that Zou, Xie, Tan, Fu, etc. have arrived at the scene, and Chen Gongbo and others are still being urged to come. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zou Lu issued a statement to all sectors, saying that the original proposal for party affairs was for Yan and Feng to nominate nine committee members, the Guangdong faction to nominate nine committee members, and the Xishan faction to nominate nine committee members. Chen Gongbo requested to increase the number of Guangdong faction members and reduce the number of Yan and Feng and Xishan faction members, which led to a deadlock. Also, Chen and others insisted on using the second Guangdong session as the main body, and we opposed using the words "second session" in the meeting title. If they do not withdraw this proposal, it will be difficult to change this deadlock. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military representative suggested that the declaration should be signed by those who are engaged in practical work. As for those who have no power and courage but only sing high praises, except for Wang and a few others who can join, the rest should not be involved, otherwise it will not be enough to face the amputated and disabled soldiers at the front. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Niu Chuanshan presented articles outlining the new government's financial plan, such as issuing the second 25 million yuan treasury bills, etc., but Yan did not fully accept them. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Pi-lian did not leave yesterday. After visiting Tan and Zou at night, he said that there is still a glimmer of hope for party affairs, and I have done my best. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Jingwei telegraphed on the 1st, first discussing party affairs, then talking about the Xishan faction's denial of the errors of the Second Central Committee, hoping that the Xishan faction would understand. It is especially unwise not to allow the Xishan faction and non-Second Central Committee members to participate. Finally, he said that looking at the current situation, it is appropriate to hold an expanded meeting immediately to determine the party's center of gravity and concentrate the party's talents in the expanded meeting. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Foreign Minister Returns to Work After Leave</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Foreign Minister attended the executive meeting on the 3rd and went to the ministry to handle official business in the afternoon. He also met with reporters from various newspapers. According to reports, he requested leave from the Executive Yuan to go to Shanghai for treatment due to abdominal pain. Later, he was advised by doctors to rest due to dental problems. However, the Central Government repeatedly urged him to return to Beijing immediately. He has resumed his duties today, but his toothache has not healed, and he still has three carbuncle teeth that need to be extracted before he can fully recover. He is scheduled to go to Shanghai for treatment again on the 5th. As for foreign affairs, it has been quite calm recently. Although there are rumors about Xiao Po being sent to China, the ministry has not received any official notification from the Japanese side. We have already decided to reject this matter, and the Japanese side may not raise it again. Also, the reason for the change in the date of the return of the Japanese acting ambassador Chongguang is still unknown. As for the issue of Britain returning the Boxer Indemnity, it must wait until British Ambassador Lampson comes to Beijing before it can proceed. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Fourth General Assembly of the Mongolian Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Mongolian Conference opened its fourth general assembly at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 3rd, with 47 representatives attending and 12 representatives attending as observers.

(Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhangjia Hutuktu telegraphed to the government and the executive yuan regarding the two proposals of the Lama Temple Management Law and the Lama Temple Registration Regulations proposed by the Mongolian Conference, which are of great importance to the interests of all Mongolian lamas, explaining the situation and requesting that the Ministry of Internal Affairs forward it to the Mongolian Conference, requiring careful consideration of this case and avoiding haste.

<p>Problem of Relief for Unemployment</p>
<h3>Ministry of Agriculture Formulates Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Agriculture has conducted detailed research on the problem of relieving national unemployment. According to investigations a few years ago, the total number of unemployed people in our country should be around 170 million. In recent years, military conflicts have been frequent, and banditry has been rampant, so the number of unemployed people has likely increased compared to before. In order to fundamentally relieve unemployment, a comprehensive plan should be made. A concrete plan has now been formulated, divided into four items: 1. Maintaining labor, 2. Increasing labor, 3. Introducing employment, 4. Assisting unemployment. The plan is very detailed and has been submitted to the Executive Yuan, requesting verification and submission to the relevant authorities to determine regulations to ensure progress. (Special dispatch of the 3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, having previously been ordered to review the case of determining the customs' anti-smuggling borderline, has concluded after review that the administrative power regarding areas outside the territorial sea need not be equal to the scope of ordinary territorial sovereignty.

<h3>All India Congress Recruits Volunteers</h3>
<h3>Expand Boycott Movement</h3>
<p>Indian Governor's New Law Implemented in Northwest Frontier Province</p>
<p>Red Shirt Party Engages in Extensive Activities, Situation is Serious</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 2nd - The National Congress is now recruiting 500,000 volunteers, aiming to expand the movement to boycott British goods to all villages in India. A mass meeting was held on Sunday to celebrate the success of capturing the Wardha salt field. Speakers urged volunteers to resist the new laws promulgated by the Indian Governor.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 2nd - A public announcement states that the laws promulgated by the Indian Governor regarding the prohibition of coercion and illegal incitement to refuse taxation apply not only to Benzebu, but also to Bengal, Bihar, Orissa, Assam, and the Northwest Frontier Province.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Bombay, 2nd - The North Xia Hua region is reportedly in a state of extreme disturbance and unease after a British soldier mistakenly used a gun yesterday, injuring a woman and a child, inciting an uproar that resulted in troops firing on the crowd, killing five and injuring many others. Furthermore, the Red Shirt Party is very active in various villages in the Northwest region, sympathizing with and aiding the Indian people. These people are all well-armed youths, clearly under the leadership of the Communist Party, so the situation is even more deteriorating. Although officials in the Indian government expect that the monsoon season will discourage the enthusiasm of Gandhi's salt-taking parties, they fear that their non-violent resistance movement will gradually shift to the leadership of revolutionary factions, taking a step further than the current refusal to pay taxes, creating a serious situation. In addition, Muslims in most areas are increasingly dissatisfied with the actions of the Indian government and are joining the National Congress's movement against British rule, which also makes the authorities deeply uneasy.</p>
<h3>Three US 10,000-Ton Warships</h3>

<h3>British Conservative Party Criticizes Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>Liberal Party Supports Government</p>
<p>Baldwin's Motion Defeated</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 2nd - Conservative Party member Gladstone asked in the House of Commons today whether the representatives of the countries attending the London Naval Conference had any understandings or undertakings that were not recorded in the treaty. Prime Minister MacDonald replied that there were none. Conservative Party member Rose asked the government to pay attention to the rumor circulating in the United States that British and American agreements could be changed to new types. However, the government did not answer. Conservative Party leader Baldwin moved to elect eleven members as a committee to review and report on the naval treaty. This committee has the power to summon personnel and obtain files for research. Baldwin said that the United States is conducting very thorough research on this treaty. The British people should first know whether British security exists and whether the solemn obligations under the Charter of the League of Nations can be fulfilled by the British in any circumstances before they sign the treaty and bind themselves. The British should especially know what position Britain's standards for European naval construction stand today and will stand in the future. British Prime Minister MacDonald said that if this approach were adopted, it would hinder the future relationship between the government and the House of Commons. The review conducted by the United States is part of its usual procedures, but in the United Kingdom, this type of review is rare. Judging from the newspapers, the opposition party does not approve of an agreement, but wants unrestricted competition. The Navy Department believes that a fair deal has been reached and that its responsibility to the people can be fulfilled. The United States says that the gains are not enough, and the Japanese and the British House of Commons have the same criticism. Is this not a sure proof of the fairness of the naval treaty? Liberal Party member Lambert spoke on behalf of the Liberal Party, supporting the government. The government can hold a majority, so it can be known that, in the end, Conservative Party member Churchill spoke, criticizing the naval treaty, saying that what is stipulated in this treaty is not equality, but Britain's retreat to the rear. Britain has never been as undefended as it will be in the future since the time of Charles II. Baldwin's motion was submitted to a public vote. As a result, the government party defeated Baldwin's motion with 282 votes against 201.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Capital Holds Anti-Smoking Commemoration</h3>
<p>The Central Anti-Smoking Committee held a June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration Meeting at the public stadium at 10:00 AM on the 3rd. Hundreds of representatives from the Central National Government and various ministries, departments, and mass organizations attended. Chairman Zhong Keto solemnly read the Prime Minister's will and anti-drug instructions, and after a three-minute silence, the chairman delivered an opening speech, briefly stating that the chairman of the committee, Zhang Zhijiang, had not yet returned to Nanjing due to his trip to the Far East Games, so he was representing the chairman. The meaning of today's commemoration meeting is slightly different from last year's. Last year's commemoration was to commemorate the pioneer Lin Zexu, but this year is the Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day promulgated by the National Government, which is being held uniformly throughout the country. Therefore, the meaning of today's commemoration meeting is extremely significant. We must never forget the anti-smoking movement, follow the Prime Minister's anti-drug instructions, continue Mr. Lin Zexu's spirit of burning opium, and work hard. There will be a day of success. Next, Zhu Hezhong, a representative of the National Government, delivered instructions, briefly stating that June 3rd is one of the most glorious pages in the history of the mass movement. However, when we think of the most humiliating national humiliation of August 29th, that is, after the Opium War 88 years ago, there was the Treaty of Nanjing. That treaty was the first unequal treaty in our country. Since then, various imperialists have taken advantage of the Qing Dynasty's deceitfulness to make demands. As a result, our country has become a semi-colony. How heartbreaking is that? The Prime Minister's will is to abolish unequal treaties in the shortest possible time. We can only follow the will and work hard, and we should continue the anti-smoking work before the Treaty of Nanjing. Therefore, anti-smoking is the first step in abolishing the treaties. If we can ban smoking, then the abolition of the treaties will not be a problem. Next, Yang Donglin, a representative of the Central Party Headquarters, delivered instructions, briefly stating that the steps for banning smoking are nothing more than banning planting, banning transportation, banning sale, and banning smoking. However, these matters cannot be completely prohibited by government power or laws. Only by working together can the masses succeed. Next, Zhang Guohui of the Judicial Yuan, Lei Xiaoyin of the Ministry of Interior, Hu Xuanming of the Ministry of Railways, and Zhan Xianzhe of the Legislative Yuan gave speeches. Finally, Dean Peng of the Jiangning Local Court reported on the anti-smoking situation in the capital, briefly stating: (1) Although the anti-smoking laws have been revised again and again, the number of opium cases in the capital has increased from an average of 60 per month last year to 200, an increase of about two times. (2) Although the laws and regulations are strict, people's hearts are dead. Diplomats are engaging in large-scale trafficking for profit, with a quantity of 2,299 cans (12 taels per can). People's hearts are dead, which is a great sigh. (3) The opium traffickers who are now caught are all extremely poor transporters, and there is no way to deal with the capitalists. (4) Since smoking has been going on for a long time, people have eaten everything and spent everything. As a result, they take risks and the increase in "Swallow's Nests" (opium dens) is almost the only way out for opium addicts. (5) Although smokers want to quit, they cannot quit due to the lack of good hospitals. Of the opium offenders who are detained, eight or nine out of ten suffer from dysentery due to the lack of substitutes. Last year, there were even cases where the police department sent them to the court without opening a trial and they died. Moreover, the regulations for food for prisoners in detention centers are 1.2 yuan per person, which is a huge expenditure for the country if there are too many people. The only way to provide relief is to establish a large-scale smoking cessation hospital. According to the chief of the Judicial Section of the Police Department, only one rickshaw puller in the capital has registered as an opium addict and asked for help to quit. He was sent to the Central Army Hospital and quit after two weeks. The rickshaw puller's behavior is commendable, and the need for smoking cessation hospitals is even more imaginable. In short, quitting smoking depends on a person's determination, and banning smoking also depends on a person's determination. Regardless of class, regardless of intelligence or stupidity, if people's hearts are dead, then diplomats can do nothing. If people's hearts are not dead, rickshaw pullers can also quit their habits. We should raise our spirits and engage in anti-smoking work. After the speeches, the 22 large boxes of opium pipes and smoking paraphernalia transported by the Jiangning County Local Court were opened and taken out by the Anti-Smoking Committee and court officials, and burned in public. It was not finished until evening.</p>
<h3>Seventy-Second Meeting of the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>On the 3rd morning, the Executive Yuan held its seventy-second meeting. Attendees included Tan Yankai, Song Ziwen, Kong Xiangxi, Yi Peiji, Wang Boqun, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Sun Ke, and Wang Zhengting. Present as observers were Chen Shaokuan, Zhang Wohua, Chen Yi, and Lü Bìchóu. Chairman Tan Yankai led the discussion on the following matters: (1) A report from the Ministry of Interior stated that the New Municipal Organization Law has been promulgated. The five cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Hankou should remove the word "Special" and be directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan. Furthermore, Beiping Special Municipality is the location of Hebei Provincial Government, and Guangzhou Special Municipality is the location of Guangdong Provincial Government. They should be renamed Beiping City and Guangzhou City, respectively, and be under the jurisdiction of Hebei and Guangdong Provincial Governments. The mayors should be reappointed. Additionally, Article 49 of the new law stipulates that before the election of district chiefs in cities under the Executive Yuan, the district chiefs shall be nominated by the mayors and appointed by the Ministry of Interior. In addition to instructing the relevant municipal governments to submit reports within the prescribed time limit, all cities under the Executive Yuan are requested to submit matters concerning the division of districts, neighborhoods, and villages to the Ministry for approval. The resolution was to forward the change of Special Municipalities to Municipalities and the reappointment of mayors to the government for approval. The rest will be handled according to the Ministry's proposal. (2) A decision was made to reply to the Sun Yat-sen County Political Training Implementation Committee, approving the record of their request to move the county government and the committee to Tangjiawan on the 15th of this month.

<h3>Preparing to Recover the Shanghai Concession Telephone System</h3>
<p>According to news from the Ministry of Communications, there is talk of selling the Shanghai Concession telephone system. The Ministry believes that the terms infringe upon national sovereignty and has already consulted with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for serious negotiations to recover it and operate it independently. It has also sent a letter to the Chinese directors of the British and French concessions, requesting their assistance in the process. The following is the written justification obtained: "Concise Justification for Recovering the Shanghai Concession Telephone System: (1) Our country has always adhered to the principle of state-owned operation for the telephone industry. Although private operation is permitted in some inland areas, it is limited to Chinese capital. The Shanghai Sino-Foreign Telephone Company, being a Sino-foreign joint venture, was already somewhat inconsistent with this principle. Now, the concession authorities intend to have foreign merchants purchase all of the Chinese merchants' existing shares, which is tantamount to seizing Chinese enterprises and handing them over to foreigners. While our government permits the development of industries using foreign capital, the nature of such ventures is that they are established with foreign capital and gradually transferred to Chinese ownership. There is no reason to turn over a business originally founded with a majority of Chinese capital to foreigners. (2) Our government is currently actively preparing to recover the concessions in China. The future existence of the Shanghai Concession is uncertain. However, the concession authorities dare to grant foreign merchants a forty-year monopoly to operate the concession telephone system, indicating a complete lack of sincerity in returning the concession. If our government does not promptly engage in negotiations, foreigners will undoubtedly become even more emboldened, and the obstacles to recovering the concession in the future will inevitably increase. (3) The telephone business can assist in the development of various industries. If operated by the national government, it can consider the interests of all citizens and aim for universal installation. If operated by foreign merchants, their purpose is solely to make profits. They will not hesitate to greatly increase rental prices to satisfy their desires. According to the budget of the International Telegraph and Telephone Corporation, which anticipates an annual net profit of 12% on invested capital based on precise statistics, telephone rental prices will increase by more than 35% compared to current prices. This price increase will largely be borne by the Chinese people. (4) The Ministry is planning improvements to the Tianjin and Hankou concession telephone systems at any time. Looking at the past performance of the Shanghai concession telephone system, the oldest type of magneto telephone is still in use, disregarding the interests of the citizens. This is evident. (5) The Shanghai Nanshi and Zhabei city telephones are operated by the Ministry. We are actively converting to automatic telephone switchboards and will be completed and in service within one year. According to the Ministry's proposed national long-distance telephone plan, Shanghai is the largest central point in the southeast. The long-distance telephone lines already established include the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. In the future, the development of the business will concentrate many long-distance lines in Shanghai. If the concession telephone system is not operated by the Ministry, connecting calls will be more complicated, and foreign telephone companies will need to add connection fees. Residents of the concession and people across the country and in the Chinese areas of Shanghai will find communication very inconvenient. (6) All telephone systems in China, whether in Chinese areas or concessions, should be operated by our country. For example, the Tianjin and Hankou concession telephone systems were initially founded by foreigners but were later recovered by our government and have been repeatedly improved. Their performance is far superior to that of the Shanghai concession telephone system. Shanghai is the only place where the concession telephone system has not been recovered, and Shanghai is the only place where two telephone management agencies exist in the same location. We should actively recover the Shanghai system to safeguard national sovereignty and eliminate this undesirable situation."</p>
<h3>Zhu Panzao Regains Freedom</h3>
<p>After the May 3rd Jinan Incident, Zhu Panzao, the Pacification Commissioner of Jiaodong, in the Shouguang area of Shandong, was accused last year by the people of Shouguang, Weixian, Guangrao, Yidu, and Linzi counties. The Shandong High Court sentenced Zhu to life imprisonment for counter-revolutionary crimes, and all his property was confiscated. Zhu refused to accept the judgment and declared an appeal. However, on the evening of the 29th, a certain military officer suddenly visited Shao, the acting president of the court (President Yin Ruxiong was in Beijing), with several guards, claiming to be under orders from a senior officer. He said that the Jin army was currently using bandits and irregular troops to disrupt Jiaodong, and that Zhu had considerable influence in the Jiaodong area. He requested that Zhu be released and allowed to atone for his crimes by performing meritorious service. Shao said that the matter concerned the judiciary and could not be done without requesting instructions from the Ministry of Justice. The military officer said that the situation was urgent and could not wait. He immediately went to the procuratorate, issued an order, and went to the detention center, brought Zhu out, and left by car.</p>
<h3>Jing County Self-Defense Corps Mutinies for Pay</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Banditry in southern Anhui has been largely suppressed after the Capital Garrison Regiment sent teams to suppress it. Jing County, located in the heart of the mountains, had previously suffered from banditry and specially recruited two battalions of the Self-Defense Corps, about a hundred men, for defense. Unexpectedly, at 2:00 AM on the 31st, a part of the second district team of the Self-Defense Corps suddenly mutinied for pay. They first shot and killed the sentry at the second district garrison, then rushed to the county government, shooting and killing the guards until they reached the main hall. Liu and Guo, the captain and vice-captain of the guard team, immediately stepped out to persuade them, saying that they would find a way to pay their salaries and asked them to return to their posts. However, the mutineers ignored them, tied them up, and killed them. They also killed six guards. The newly appointed County Magistrate Zhang Guoying was also tied up, but fortunately unharmed. They then robbed 5,300 yuan in cash, 40 rifles, 20 Mauser pistols, and 2 light machine guns. They also broke into the prison and released 48 prisoners. Subsequently, they went to the streets and robbed Hengfa Long Money Shop and other stores such as Gonghe, Wanfu, and Fuhexiang. At around 10:00 AM, the Self-Defense Corps from various townships received the news and rushed to the scene, joining forces with the city's unmoved police, deployed defenses around the four city gates and surrounded the area. Before long, the mutineers, carrying the stolen goods, rushed to the north gate and encountered the blocking Self-Defense Corps. The two sides exchanged fire for an hour. One mutineer was killed and several were injured. The mutineers were unable to withstand the attack and broke out of the north gate and fled. By then, it was already 1:00 PM. Afterwards, County Magistrate Zhang was untied and reported the incident to the provincial government. He also convened a post-incident meeting with various sectors of the community. The local order has gradually returned to stability. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui After Arriving in Russia</h3>
<p>Exchanged Views with Karakhan</p>
<p>Russia Insists on Dissent on the Issue of Redeeming the Railway</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence: Mo Dehui arrived in Russia on the 9th. On the 11th noon, he visited Acting Chairman of the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee, Litvinov, and Karakhan at the Foreign Affairs Committee. On the morning of the 12th, Litvinov and Karakhan returned the visit. That evening, a banquet was held in the hall of the Foreign Affairs Committee for Mo and the special commissioners Li Chen and Tu Wei-tseng. During the banquet, Litvinov and Karakhan both delivered speeches, welcoming Mo as the plenipotentiary and wishing the Sino-Russian conference a success and the consolidation of relations between the two countries. Mo also gave a reply. On the 13th, Mo visited the ambassadors of various countries stationed in Russia, including Britain, Japan, Italy, and France. On the 14th, the ambassadors returned the visit. When Mo first arrived in Russia, he and the special commissioners stayed at the embassy, while the entourage stayed at hotels. Later, because the embassy had been unoccupied for a long time, the air was damp, and the climate was unsuitable, several people, including special commissioner Li Chen and secretary Cai Yuchen, became ill. They moved into the Soviet Russian state-run "Chemiatad" Hotel. However, the hotel had few rooms, so only Mo and four special commissioners, four secretaries, and female staff members Cui Shuyan and Sun Suzhen stayed there. The rest of the entourage stayed at the Austrian Chamber of Commerce and set up the Chinese Plenipotentiary Office for the Sino-Russian Conference there. Telegrams sent from Moscow to Harbin used the Siberian and Chinese Eastern Railway telegraph lines, and ordinary telegrams arrived in four or five hours, so the transmission of information was relatively fast. However, most of the news about the conference came from the Russian side. Since Mo arrived in Russia, there has not been a single detailed telegram to Harbin. It is difficult to prove whether it has been sent and intercepted by the Russians. In the past two days, Mo has sent two consecutive telegrams, which are recorded as follows: (1) The "You" telegram stated, "I have been exchanging views with the Russian plenipotentiary Karakhan for days, and the atmosphere has been extremely harmonious. Today, the Russian side notified that they have appointed seven specialist commissioners: Kazlovsky, Director of the Second Oriental Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Fan Baning, Director of the Treaty Division; Dr. Pianchgamint; Beirlazki, Director of the National Bank; Gao Fuman, Director of the Treaty Division of the Ministry of Commerce; Izmailov, Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway; and Kantarovici, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The official opening date of the meeting is under negotiation and will be no later than the end of the month." (2) The "Qin" telegram stated, "Last night at 8:00 PM, Karakhan, in his capacity as representative, hosted a banquet for your brother (Mo referred to himself) and the special commissioners and secretaries, accompanied by the Russian specialist commissioners. Everyone had a pleasant time, and the meeting is in the process of exchanging views." Regarding the truth of the conference, according to reports from the Railway Bureau and the Mo Asia Agency (Harbin-Soviet joint news agency), at 10:00 AM on May 20, the plenipotentiaries and specialist commissioners from both China and the Soviet Union held the opening ceremony of the conference in the hall of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Litvinov attended and delivered a speech, hoping that the conference would be completed soon. Karakhan and Mo Dehui both gave speeches. From the 21st, the Chinese specialist commissioners and the members of the Chinese Eastern Railway designated by the Soviet Union began to sort out the proposals. On the 24th and 26th, Plenipotentiary Mo and Plenipotentiary Jia met to exchange views on the conference. Plenipotentiary Mo said that he was ordered to raise the issue of redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway. Plenipotentiary Jia said that the Soviet Union believed that all the property of the Chinese Eastern Railway belonged to the Soviet Russian government, and that China's so-called equal rights in the Chinese Eastern Railway only referred to the splitting of dividends and current business. If China intended to redeem the railway, it would have to pay the full value of the entire railway. The Soviet Union hoped that China would not violate the spirit of the Boli Agreement and would negotiate the Sino-Soviet commercial treaty, consular matters, and navigation rights with sincerity. Plenipotentiary Mo said that since the Russian Agreement stipulated that the rights of the Chinese and Russians in the Chinese Eastern Railway were equal, it naturally recognized that everything was equal, and property was one of them, and so on. However, because it was an exchange of views, there was no formal debate. This is the report. It is predicted that the issue of redeeming the railway will be difficult to obtain the consent of the Russian side. (May 28)</p>
<h3>After the German Industrial Inspection Group Arrived in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The German Industrial Inspection Group arrived in Shenyang at 6:40 AM on the 26th. Those who welcomed them at the station included Yang Yuzhen, representative of Zhang Xueliang; Jia Chengzhang, representative of the Communications Committee; Chen Wendou, representative of the Agricultural and Mining Department; Lin Chengxiu, representative of the Provincial Government; Shen Zutong, representative of the Foreign Affairs Office; Jin Enqi, representative of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Wang Zhuoran, representative of Northeastern University; Du Dianying, director of the Beining Railway Huangguatun Materials Factory; Ning Encheng, secretary of the Border Affairs Office, and others. After the group got off the train, they were led by the reception staff to the Kaining Hotel. There were a total of nine people in the group. Also accompanying them were Jin Jingyang, counselor of the Ministry of Railways; Yang Gongzhao, section chief of the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining; Zhu Qian, technical expert of the Construction Committee; and Bao Keyong and Xu Xueyu, secretaries of the group. They all stayed at the Kaining Hotel. At 9:30 AM on the 27th, the group visited Northeastern University and the university factory. At noon, they had an informal meal at the Kaining Hotel. In the afternoon, they visited the chairman of the provincial government, the director of the Agricultural and Mining Department, the foreign affairs commissioner, and the chairman of the chamber of commerce. At 7:00 PM, they met with Zhang Xueliang, who hosted a banquet at his private residence. All the reception staff were present as well. At 9:00 AM on the 28th, the group visited the arsenal for more than two hours. Then, they were invited to a banquet by the German merchants in Shenyang, including Krupp Steel Factory and Lihuo Foreign Firm. In the afternoon at around 3:00 PM, they visited the Forbidden City Museum and the Tongze Girls' Middle School and the Beidaying Radio Station. They did not return to their residence until dusk. In the evening, five groups, including the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Education Association, the Agricultural Association, the National Foreign Affairs Association, and the Pacific National Relations Discussion Society, hosted a banquet at the Tongze Clubhouse. The guests included leaders of various institutions and more than 30 reporters from various newspapers. German and Chinese flags were crossed at the entrance to show friendship. Before the banquet began, they showed an industrial film brought by the group, which depicted the interior of the Leipzig Machinery Exhibition Hall in Germany, demonstrating the precision and flexibility of the machinery construction, which was amazing. The audience deeply admired Germany's progress in material civilization. After the film ended, they went to the dining hall for a meal. Jin Enqi, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, delivered a welcome speech on behalf of the group, saying: The relationship between China and Germany has always been friendly. After the European War, the two countries concluded an equal treaty, and the relationship has become even closer. In recent decades, your country has been able to restore its economic status to almost the same level as before the war in a difficult and arduous environment. The industrial sector has made the greatest contribution to this spirit of struggle. Our country is now suffering from the oppression of the great powers and economic difficulties, which is no less than your country's past. There are many things that should be learned from. Fortunately, your delegation has graced us with your presence, and we are sure that you will provide our industrial sector with great assistance. Please give us detailed instructions based on your observations so that we can use them as a guide, and please do not be polite. And please convey the situation in the Northeast and the desire to assist to your government and people after your return to your country, so that we can realize a kind of economic cooperation and construction on the basis of peace, and use all kinds of strength, or capital, talent, and equipment, to jointly develop the rich resources of the Northeast with friendly assistance. There is also something I would like to ask your delegation to pay attention to. The propaganda of imperialists about the Northeast is all with ulterior motives and completely inconsistent with the facts, and contains the meaning of excluding other countries. Some of you may have come from Dalian on the South Manchuria Railway and met a Austrian named Clooney used by Mantetsu, who welcomed you and said how good a certain country is and how it should plunder China's Northeast to deceive European and American travelers. Please do not believe it lightly and fall into his trick, so as not to affect the economic cooperation between the two countries. The Northeast is now under the oppression of Japan and Red Russia, which is the same as your country being oppressed by France after the European War. I hope that you will uphold justice and help us in many ways. The authorities in the Northeast love peace and do not participate in the civil war, and the political progress is gradual, so that the social economy can develop freely without any influence. The people of the Northeast are hardworking and tolerant, and their customs are good and law-abiding. The laborers and assets are not very obvious, and the work results are also obvious. Moreover, the products are rich and the sources of profit are waiting to be developed. The only thing lacking is talent and capital. If there is no political aggression background, foreign capital is welcome, and so on. After the speech, he raised his glass and wished Sino-German friendship eternal. Then, Heinrich Retymaun, the representative of the inspection group, delivered a reply, saying: "I feel honored to visit your country this time and to receive hospitality everywhere. We are especially grateful for the special treatment we have received in the Northeast. Our delegation is very grateful. I have just heard from your Chairman that the conclusion of an equal treaty between China and Germany is the best opportunity for Sino-German cooperation. Our delegation sincerely accepts and shares the same feeling. After returning to our country, we should make efforts to promote the will of your esteemed office to our government, society and people, so that our country can fully understand the real situation in the Northeast and realize the economic cooperation between China and Germany. The abundant production, education and culture of the Northeast are admirable. Tonight's banquet is the beginning of an unprecedented era in Sino-German relations, and I am very honored." He raised his glass and wished Sino-German friendship and economic cooperation would last forever. It was already past 7:00 PM when the meeting adjourned in cheers. Jin Enqi and more than 30 others accompanied the group to the Beining Railway Station and boarded the 7:45 PM train to Beiping (May 28 evening)</p>

<p>District Chief Suspended from Duty After Being Accused: Yuan Chunlin, the district chief of the fourteenth district (Yexie) in the county, was accused by Fei of Yexie and others of discrepancies in the amount collected and the reversed order of the numbers of the national debt coupons. The county government sent personnel to investigate and verified the facts, and requested instructions from the province. It is now learned that the Jiangsu Provincial Mobilization and Redemption National Debt Coupon Committee has instructed the county government to investigate and deal with the case according to Article 13 of the Redemption National Debt Coupon Regulations, which provides for legal punishment by judicial authorities for damaging the credit of the coupon. The committee ordered that District Chief Yuan Chunlin and employee Gu Fenggang be placed under judicial authority for legal handling.

A special police donation will be collected from the houses for one month. If it is still not enough, it will be raised by various legal groups. Now, the Puzhao Temple repair is completed, and the Public Security Bureau will move soon. The High Court yesterday sent Secretary Yao to Song to inspect and plan to establish the County Court within a month. The court has now ordered craftsmen to rush to repair three courtrooms in order to be established as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Bandit Riot in Liuqiao District: There was a riot by bandits in Huaji Bridge, Liuqiao District, in the north of Tongyi. The police team of the Public Security Bureau and the Security Regiment were engaged in a joint suppression operation. The bandits resisted stubbornly for half an hour before gradually collapsing. Regiment officer Chen Shi died of injuries.</p>
<p>Suhan Soldier Field Case Filed: The old Su Town and Langshan two camp soldier fields were reported to the Ministry of Military Administration by Yu Bujiou, etc. The Ministry of Military Administration submitted the case to the National Government, ordering the Nantong County Government to order the Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company, which had contracted the land, to pay the price. If it was unwilling, the department would take it back and release it. The Tonghai Reclamation and Animal Husbandry Company refused to accept the above-mentioned punishment and declared that it would file an administrative lawsuit. County Magistrate Zhang has submitted it to the Ministry of Military Administration for review.</p>
<p>Suppressing Fleeing Bandits in the Siyu Area: The bandits and communists in the Siyu area of Nantong were suppressed by the Hu camp of the National Army and the Provincial Police Team, and scattered in several groups.

County Magistrate Zhang immediately complied.</p>
<p>Qidong Bandit Disaster Strikes Again: Communist Party members and pirates colluded in Qidong, causing another disturbance. The Hu camp of the Fifth Division stationed in Tong rushed to suppress the riot and blocked the fleeing bandits in the Huolong Town area.</p>

<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Wounded Soldiers Arrive in Suzhou: The county government has repeatedly received telegrams from Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the Ministry of Military Administration, ordering it to find houses that can accommodate more than 1,000 people for the rear 15th Hospital, and sending the director of the hospital, Yang Jinrun, to Suzhou to assist the county government in handling the matter. County Magistrate Huang immediately surveyed the Gongbing Regiment in Fengqiao as the hospital site and invited local doctors and representatives of institutions and organizations to handle matters in separate groups. In addition to ordering the Finance Bureau to allocate 1,000 yuan for expenses, he has telegraphed the Finance Department for verification and instructions. As for the wounded soldiers, in addition to the 600 who arrived the day before yesterday, County Magistrate Huang reported to the headquarters that the county's quota had been filled.</p>
<p>Poor Silkworm Season in the Eastern and Western Mountains: This spring, the silk season in Suzhou was bleak, which has never been seen before. In the past, there were 13 silk houses in the eastern and western mountains, but this spring, due to the poor silkworm season, only eight houses were left. The income of dried cocoons was about 1,000 dan, which was only one-third of the previous year. The market price was about 7 yuan per dan. In the silkworm season in various villages, many cocoons were thin-skinned due to illness and stiffness. The villagers had previously been troubled by the disaster of rice worms and droughts in the fields in the autumn, and they reported that the silkworm business had failed this spring. As a result, as many as nine people committed suicide in one month. The silk houses also see the silk market as being bleak, with income not covering expenses, and the future of the silk industry is also unimaginable. Zhang Zizhen, a silk merchant, plans to promote the cultivation of 5,000 sheets of autumn silkworm seeds and hundreds of silkworm tents for villagers to purchase.</p>
<p>Memorial Service for Cheng Xuelou: The coffin of Cheng Xuelou, the former governor of Jiangsu, is scheduled to arrive in Suzhou for burial on the 15th of this month.

These incidents have occurred in the bustling city center, but much time has passed, and the truth remains unclear. The identity of the perpetrators has also not been discovered, which is detrimental to the local area. Yesterday, a special order was issued to the detective team to pay close attention and solve the case within ten days.</p>
<p>Another Suicide Due to Debt: Zhou Gongpei, a brewer in Zhou Xiang, Miaoqiao, Xinan Township, District 13, previously obtained ingredients on credit from a rice shop in Zhouxin Town, accumulating a debt of 120 yuan. He promised to repay the debt during this year's silkworm market. However, this year's silkworm season was a complete failure, and the proceeds from the sale of silkworm cocoons were less than ten yuan. As the deadline for repayment approached, he was left with no choice but to hang himself from a tree in front of his yard on the night before last. By the time his family discovered him, he had already died.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Further Arrests in Kidnapping Case: Wang Minwei, a police inspector at the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau outside the North Gate of Wuba, previously solved the kidnapping case at Baofu Temple in Shizhu Tou. The victim was rescued on the spot, and the suspects were handed over to the court for interrogation. Later, patrol leader Jin Dejin learned that key suspect Liu Shaoyun had fled to Wuxi. Patrol Inspector Wang dispatched Patrol Inspector Qiao to Wuxi, who happened to encounter Liu Shaoyun arriving in Changzhou by car. He followed him to Shizhu Temple, where he apprehended him. Another suspect, Huang Youcai, was also apprehended. After a preliminary interrogation, they were transferred to the county court on the afternoon of the 1st to await trial.</p>

The rescued kidnap victims include Ma Yunbin, who has already arrived in the city, as well as two women and one boy, who are still at the Shierxu Port. The five bandits were temporarily held in the detention center that night and were scheduled to be transferred to the county for interrogation on the 2nd.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Robbery at Jiufang Village: The home of Xue Yongjia in Jiufang Village, Denglin Township, District 11, was robbed by five bandits the night before last. They stole 300 yuan from selling silkworm cocoons and over 70 yuan in jewelry, then fled.</p>
<p>Chengwu Joint Defense Scheduled Meeting: Cheng County's western townships border Wujin County. Last month, the County Party Consolidation Committee sent a letter to the Wujin County Consolidation Committee to discuss countermeasures. Upon the proposal of Standing Committee Member Xu Wenjun, the party and government agencies of the two counties jointly formed the Wucheng Joint Defense Association. After consultation and agreement between the two counties, it is now scheduled to hold a meeting at Jiaoxi Town, Daning Township, Wujin County, on the 12th.</p>
<p>Investigation Report on the Zhanggujian Robbery Case: On the 29th, the home of Gu Zipei in Zhanggujian, east of the city, was robbed and looted, and six and a half rooms were burned down. After the incident was reported in the county newspaper, County Magistrate Li ordered the Public Security Bureau chief to investigate. Chief Li dispatched detective chief Yang Bingwei to investigate. According to Gu's wife, she received two threatening letters from bandits in February and March of this year, demanding a loan of 300 to 400 yuan. Due to poverty, she refused. She reported the incident to the security team for capture, but they were unsuccessful. Unexpectedly, a fire suddenly broke out in the house late the other night. Fortunately, the people escaped. Upon inspection, six and a half rooms were burned down, and all belongings were destroyed. While the fire was raging, she saw three or four shadowy figures under the trees, but she could not identify whether they were bandits or not. Perhaps it was caused by the bandits' hatred. Chief Li submitted a report to County Magistrate Li on the 2nd for handling.</p>

Silk merchants Wang Jiheng, Yu Yixuan, Guan Yangzhi, and Liu Jiean were invited to discuss the matter and requested to be responsible for fundraising. Wang and the others declined with polite words, stating that the people are destitute after last year's major disaster, lacking funds and avoiding debt. County Magistrate Zhang, due to the approaching deadline and the lack of progress in raising the bonds, went to Hangzhou and then to Shanghai on May 31 to solicit donations from wealthy merchants from Shangyu living abroad.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Cheng Wenchai Killed in Licheng: Cheng Wenchai, the bandit leader of Licheng in western Linhai, gathered hundreds of fierce bandits from Tianxian and other counties, including Yang Wenchong. They have now burned down dozens of civilian houses in Suoxian Village in the southern part of the county, and their activities are very rampant. County Magistrate Hou Changling and Battalion Commander Xu Menggao immediately ordered Xu Chuanyi, the platoon leader of the Ninth Company of the Third Battalion, Guo Lizhou, the company commander of the Seventh Company of the Second Battalion, as well as Ma Laowei, the special agent of the Fifth Regiment of the Zhangjiadu Security Corps, and Xu Junqing, the captain of the First Squad of the County Patrol Team, to lead their troops and encircle and suppress the bandits in different directions. On May 30, they killed the bandit leader Cheng Wenchai and two of his followers, Wang Detang, at Zhao Laoye in Fangxikou, and injured many other bandits.</p>
<p>Suoxian Village Burned and Looted by Bandits: Yesterday morning (the 29th), Cheng Wenchai, the bandit leader of Licheng, suddenly arrived in Suoxian Village in southern Linhai, along with over 200 bandits from Xianju and Huangsha in the county.

<h3>Anqing</h3>
<p>Ransom for Kidnapped French Priest in Huoshan: Two French priests were previously kidnapped in Huoshan by bandits. The Anhui Provincial Government received a telegram from the General Headquarters requesting the commander of the newly formed Second Brigade, Pan Shanzhai, to find a way to rescue them quickly. Recently, Commander Pan reported in a telegram that his brigade is currently dispatching troops to attack the bandit stronghold in Yanzi River and investigating the lair of the communist bandit pseudo-commander Zhou Weixun in Nanxi, Shangcheng County, southern Henan. A letter from Nanxi stated that the kidnapped French priests from Huoshan are currently staying in the Lin Family Ancestral Hall there. It requires 40 machine guns, 80 boxes of ammunition, and 100,000 yuan to redeem them; otherwise, it will cause diplomatic trouble, which is not what the church is concerned about. It requests the government to quickly send telegrams to Hubei and Henan provinces to cooperate in suppressing the bandits regardless of borders, not only to rescue the kidnapped priests but also to eliminate the communist scourge. The General Headquarters and the Hankou Headquarters have been notified, requesting them to quickly order the troops in Shangcheng to assist in the rescue to avoid diplomatic issues. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Commander Pan have also been notified for their information.</p>
<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Zhuang Jieqing of Fengxian</h3>
<p>Regarding the communication from Fengxian published in your esteemed newspaper on the 1st of this month, which mentioned the lawsuit arising from the imprisonment of the father's concubine, the facts are not accurate. My stepmother, Shen, due to accumulated debts and a difficult life, asked relatives such as Ma Shuchao to consult with the Zhuang clan. She voluntarily requested to sever the relationship. As a junior member of the family, I, Jieqing, dared not say a word. The procedures were completed by both parties, and the county government was petitioned for record-keeping. However, malicious individuals fabricated rumors and falsely reported to the First District Office, which forwarded the report to the county government, ordering the Public Security Bureau to send personnel to investigate. After the clan members guided the investigator to question Shen, it was found that there was no such thing. After reporting the situation, Jieqing immediately filed a criminal lawsuit according to the law and attached a claim for damages to reputation.</p>
<p>This matter concerns my personal morals and the reputation of the entire clan. Therefore, I specially request your newspaper to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" section and promptly correct the matter to conform to the facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Silver Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Margin Calls Soar... Commodity Prices Rise</p>
<p>Public Morale Shaken... Commerce on the Brink</p>
<p>The Wenhui Bao reports that silver prices continue to fall, and gold prices are soaring. The local foreign exchange market has fallen into an extremely critical situation. The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun states that there is no sign of recovery in the silver market, and with military affairs unresolved and commerce stagnant, it is feared that China will ultimately fall into bankruptcy due to the disastrous fall in silver prices. While these words may be an overstatement, it is true that many businesses in Shanghai are on the verge of failure. This morning (3rd), the opening price of British exchange was still one shilling and seven pence one two five, but soon quickly shrank to one shilling and six pence two five, a new price never seen before. The US exchange also shrank to 37 and a half yuan. Margin calls opened in the morning at 548 taels 8 mace and closed at noon as high as 559 taels 4 mace. The afternoon opening at 2:00 PM was 559 taels 2 mace, but by 2:15 PM it had soared to 569 taels 3 mace, another new record unheard of. It closed at 568 taels 9 mace. The shock to the public inside the gold exchange at that time can be imagined.</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News says that since the sharp drop in silver prices in January of this year, the cost of living has risen accordingly, causing great concern among businessmen, and consumers are feeling even more pain. Monthly income is often insufficient to cover expenses. Several commercial firms have already increased employee salaries, and employees who have not yet received a raise are all hoping for a turnaround in the market. In January, the public already thought things were bad, but compared to the situation this month, it was as if they were still in paradise. Yesterday, the North-China Daily News carried nine advertisements saying that due to the fall in exchange rates, they had no choice but to raise prices. Since the fall in silver prices and the revision of import taxes, imported goods have risen by at least 20% compared to before, and most are between 30% and 60%. Some have even risen by 70%. Therefore, the current cost of living has increased by at least 50% compared to last year. Looking to the future, we do not know where things will end.</p>

<h3>Curbing the Skyrocketing Price of Flour</h3>
<p>To Maintain Food for the People</p>
<p>In recent months, the price of flour in the city has risen repeatedly. In order to curb manipulation, the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday specially instructed the Flour Exchange to find ways to stabilize market prices. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Order for Instruction: Flour is a necessity for the people, and its price fluctuations are of great importance to people's livelihoods. Since last month, there have been repeated price increases, and officials have been dispatched to thoroughly investigate and handle the matter. However, it is reported that on the 2nd of this month, near-term flour prices rose again by three cents compared to last month's close, and the rise in far-term prices was even greater, with the October term rising by as much as six and a half cents, which is shocking. At a time when new wheat is on the market, the rise in flour prices is inappropriate and especially harmful. It is evident that someone is intentionally manipulating the market, disregarding the food needs of the people. It is hereby ordered that the Exchange, from the date of this document, immediately find ways to stabilize and curb manipulation in order to maintain food for the people. This is of utmost importance. This order, etc.</p>
<h3>Actual Situation of the Anti-Smoking Memorial</h3>
<p>Swearing to Reject Drugs</p>
<p>Passing Proposals</p>
<p>Yesterday was the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Memorial. It was jointly prepared by the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters, the Shanghai Special Municipality Government, and the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association. At 9:00 AM, a memorial meeting was held at the assembly hall of the Chamber of Commerce. Party and government agencies at all levels in the city were invited to send five representatives to participate. The situation was very enthusiastic. Around 8:00 AM, representatives from various agencies and organizations had arrived in droves. Reporters from various newspapers rushed to take photos. The following is a summary of the meeting.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation: Yesterday, more than 300 representatives from party and government agencies at all levels in the city attended the meeting. Mayor Zhang Yuejun, Dr. Wang Jingqi, Bureau Chief Chen Dezheng, and General Secretary Huang Jiahui presided over the meeting. Yang Bingxun and Shen Chuanyang served as recorders. The meeting opened as scheduled.</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Address: Everyone, today is the June 3rd Memorial. Ninety-one years ago today, Mr. Lin Zexu made a resolution in Guangdong to resist imperialism and burn the opium that harmed the country and the people. He is worthy of admiration and worship. However, the Qing court at that time was ignorant of the matter, so the result was the signing of the unequal Treaty of Nanjing. Since this unequal treaty, China's diplomacy has never been free from the oppression of imperialists. We look at how many humiliations China has suffered, all contained within it. In that situation, Mr. Lin was able to resolutely and forcefully handle the matter, but the people did not implement his proposal, which is very heartbreaking. Now, the National Government has learned from its pain and designated today as a memorial day of national humiliation, calling on everyone to rise up and work hard, not only to wash away the international humiliation, but also to strengthen our physiques and invigorate our spirits to complete our national revolution. Therefore, today's meeting is not a casual five-minute burst of enthusiasm, but very important and meaningful. It is something we must do together, and everyone must rise up and work hard. If we want to achieve the goal of prohibiting smoking, we must have (1) a common will, (2) consistent steps internally and externally, and (3) research on post-implementation measures. In terms of propaganda, everyone should take responsibility and not let the Anti-Drug Association do it alone. Let us make a resolution, implement the teachings of the Premier, and eliminate this poison.</p>
<p>Speeches by Prominent Figures: (A) Comrade Chen Dewei said in his speech, roughly: Today's memorial should have the following understanding: (1) Emulate Mr. Lin's spirit of rejecting drugs and work hard with one heart and one mind. (2) We should recognize that opium is the main reason for China's frequent internal turmoil and foreign aggression throughout history. (3) To achieve the goal of eradication, we must strive to abolish unequal treaties. I hope that everyone will not treat today's memorial as a fleeting cloud and thoroughly support the efforts of the Anti-Drug Association. (B) Dr. Wang Jingqi said in his speech: For a hundred years, China has faced internal and external troubles, and the situation has worsened year by year. Therefore, our nation has more and more things to commemorate. Today's June 3rd Memorial has three major characteristics: (1) It is the starting point of internal and external troubles for a hundred years. (2) The source of the Opium War and unequal treaties. (3) The beginning of political, economic, and military oppression by imperialists. We recognize the above-mentioned characteristics, boldly struggle, and we can certainly look forward to success.</p>
<h3>Photography of the June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration Meeting (Photographed by Ronghua)</h3>
<p>Huang Jiahui's Report: Briefly stated, the June 3rd commemoration was jointly prepared by the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Department, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, and the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association. Today, we are holding the commemoration meeting here. I, representing the June 3rd Preparatory Committee, report to you on the current drug situation in our country: (1) Regarding the situation of domestic opium cultivation, since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the situation of domestic opium cultivation has indeed improved compared to the past. In the three northeastern provinces, as well as Anhui and Fujian, the amount of opium seedlings planted is only about one-tenth of what it used to be. However, recently, in the Jinjiang and Nan'an areas of southern Fujian, local authorities are still rewarding people for planting opium. As for provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Gansu, and Shaanxi, according to recent investigations, the area planted with opium has reached over 2.5 million mu, producing approximately 100 million taels of opium. Opium cultivation has already led to massive famine disasters, with corpses filling the fields, yet the local authorities are still not aware. Every Yangtze River steamship carries opium, and special tax offices are set up in Wuhan and Guangzhou to collect opium taxes, despite numerous protests, to no avail. The situation in the Shanghai Concession remains the same as before, with opium dens standing in rows and opium houses everywhere. The Concession authorities collect protection fees, amounting to no less than 10,000 yuan per day. Recently, a strange ship exporting from Persia, loaded with opium worth £250,000, has become a matter of international concern. Actual investigations reveal that these drugs will be completely transported into our country. (2) Regarding the harm of narcotics, due to the increased production of foreign narcotics in recent years, those harmed by them are most prevalent in the three northeastern provinces and the Yellow River basin, and are spreading into the Yangtze River basin, even reaching the southern provinces. It is estimated that over 800,000 taels of narcotics are shipped into our country each year. The Japanese have even established factories in Lushun and Chongqing to manufacture narcotics to harm our people. 70% of the Japanese in the South Manchurian area are engaged in narcotics smuggling as their profession, and in various places in the eastern provinces, as well as Tianjin, Jinan, Shijiazhuang, etc., there is large-scale narcotics trade by the Japanese. According to recent investigations, there are over 130 narcotics factories worldwide, and the amount they produce is truly alarming. (3) Regarding the tragic situation of Chinese overseas being subjected to monopoly, various colonial countries in Southeast Asia implement an opium monopoly policy specifically targeting Chinese overseas, which is also a major problem in our country's opium prohibition. According to investigations, there are about 2 million Chinese overseas in British Malaya, with 400,000 opium smokers, resulting in an annual loss of over 60 million yuan in national currency. Of these 400,000 people, only about 80,000 had smoked opium in China, while the other 320,000 became addicted after arriving in British territory. They consume a total of 3,190,998 taels of opium each year. In the Dutch East Indies, there are 959,594 Chinese overseas, with 19,552 licensed opium smokers, and 70,266 unregistered ones on record, with at least another 70,000 not included in the statistics. The annual consumption of opium is 1,640,966 taels and 6.5 qian, worth 42,837,106 guilders, not including smuggled opium. Among the Javanese natives, two out of every thousand smoke opium, while among our overseas Chinese, the figure is probably two hundred out of every thousand. Other colonies purchase opium from Singapore, amounting to 19,013,120 taels per year, estimated at about 400 million yuan in national currency. The above situation is truly heartbreaking, especially when commemorating June 3rd, it evokes immense sorrow. Although there is an anti-drug movement in society, the public still lacks a clear awareness. Although the government has adopted a strict prohibition policy based on public opinion, the committees responsible for opium prohibition have failed to implement it vigorously. Opium cultivation in southern Fujian continues as before, opium transportation on the Yangtze River continues as before, special taxes in Wuhan and Guangzhou continue as before, and red pills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang continue as before, with no solutions. It is hoped that everyone, on the one hand, will continue the spirit of June 3rd, unite and strive, and urge the government to achieve success, and on the other hand, hope that the anti-smoking association colleagues will work hard to implement various treaties and not just pay lip service.</p>
<p>Planning the Construction of a Memorial Hall: At that time, the construction of the Lin Zexu Memorial Hall was approved, and Wang Jingqi, Zhang Qun, Chen Dezheng, Ma Xiangbo, Lin Xiang, Zheng Yuxiu, Li Denghui, Ye Huijun, and over ten others were publicly recommended as preparatory committee members.</p>
<p>County Government Commemoration: The Shanghai County Government held an anti-smoking commemoration ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over fifty people participated, including members of the County Reorganization Committee and officials from various bureaus and departments under the County Government. County Magistrate Yan presided, Sun Yizhuo served as the master of ceremonies, and Hu Gongshou recorded. After the meeting began, rituals were performed, and then the chairman gave an opening speech, reporting on the harm of opium, the importance of public prohibition, and the need to actively investigate and prohibit opium in the current handling of opium prohibition. On the one hand, we must make the concept of prohibition widespread so that the general public knows to abstain, and we must also pay attention to education. Only then can we hope to completely eradicate it. Next, Shi De, the chief of the judicial section of the County Public Security Bureau, reported on the anti-smoking situation. Then, Shen Jinghua, the chief of the County Public Security Bureau, and Tao Yishan, the representative of the County Reorganization Committee, delivered speeches in succession. After the ceremony, the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Commander Xiong</p>
<h3>Discussion on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui convened a press conference at his headquarters in Longhua at 2:00 PM. He spoke as follows: "Recently, due to foreign reports spreading rumors, people have become perplexed. I will specifically discuss the truth of the war and my observations on the war situation with everyone. (1) Jinpu Front: After the Yan-Feng rebel army suffered a crushing defeat on the Longhai Front, they created the illusion of attacking us from the Jinpu Line to contain the Longhai Front. In reality, near Tianjin, there is only Fu Zuoyi's unit, with less than 10,000 men. The officers and soldiers have a deep addiction to opium and are exceptionally weak in combat. If they were defending a Shanxi mountain stronghold, they might be able to barely hold out. But to say they are attacking Shandong, even Yan Xishan himself probably doesn't believe his troops have that ability. Moreover, Chief Commander Han has already inflicted a heavy blow on Fu Zuoyi in the Qingcheng campaign. Once our army on the Longhai Line has completely adjusted its battle line and begins its attack, it can drive straight north. With Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin) empty, it is within easy reach. (2) Longhai Front: The rebel enemies on this front, who are resisting the Central Government, whether they are the defeated generals of Feng Yuxiang's troops or the men of the Old West Army of Yan Xishan who have two guns (one opium pipe), it might be believable to say they are defending against the Central Army, but they are absolutely not qualified to attack the Central Army. Their past war history and the recent battle of Guide are the best examples. If they are willing to take the offensive, the Central Army would welcome it very much. Because they dare not take the offensive, the war on the Longhai Line is only a matter of us hitting them. We can hit them whenever and wherever we want. It's like Go, we have the first move. Furthermore, the railway from Xuzhou to Luoyang, going to the vicinity of Lanfeng, is considered halfway. Most of the Central Army's battles east of Lanfeng have been pursuit battles. After this long-distance pursuit by the Central Army from Dangshan to Lanfeng, plus Lanfeng having a city to defend, it is only natural for the Central Army to adjust its battle line near Lanfeng without pressing the pursuit. However, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang took the opportunity to spread rumors, saying that the Central Army was defeated, with 50,000 captured and 40,000 casualties. The commander-in-chief and many army and division commanders were injured. They want to use counter-propaganda to restore their declining morale, which is nothing but wishful thinking. If they really have the strength to counterattack, why don't they run out of Lanfeng and fight the Central Army for a decisive victory? I think that once the Central pursuit force is properly deployed, even if the rebel army wants to hold the city, it will not be able to hold it for long. (3) Pinghan Front: The vicinity of Xuchang was originally the defensive area of Feng Yuxiang's army. After Yan Xishan's forces failed on the Longhai Front, Feng Yuxiang mobilized the troops on the southern route in a rush to provide support, so the southern route became extremely empty. In total, Feng Yuxiang's army has no more than 80,000 men, so he can't attend to both ends and is in a terrible mess. Now, our Third Army Corps has gradually wiped out the miscellaneous troops in southern Henan and is about to directly attack Zhengzhou. After Zhengzhou falls, the rebel army entrenched in the central Henan area is no different from a turtle in a jar. (4) Remnants of Zhang Guirao: Because they were severely attacked by the Guangdong anti-rebel army, they fled out of the Hunan border, attempting to imitate Zhu De and Mao Zedong to survive. Now our three provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Hunan are sending troops to encircle and suppress them, and they will be completely eliminated very soon. Even in their most rampant period, Zhang Guirao's rebel army could not resist the strength of one corner of Guangdong. Now, with their remaining forces, they are being encircled and suppressed by three provinces, so there is no chance of survival. In addition, a group of idle politicians and rebel party members, led by Wang Jingwei, are also active in Pingjin, causing disturbances for half a year, but still without any solution. Wang Jingwei uses the signboard of false revolution for the sake of power struggle. First, he debases himself to begging for pity from the Guangxi clique, whom he usually considers feudal forces, and then he goes on to ingratiate himself with Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, whom he usually considers warlords. Such people lead and collude with reactionary forces, and want to confront the Central Government, which is fighting for principles, and wage war against the Central Army, which is righteous and confident under the leadership of the Party. There is no other way out except defeat and collapse. Moreover, Wang Jingwei is merely being used by Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. They summon him when they need him, and he has no choice but to leave when they wave him away. He is not even qualified to be called a leader. On the contrary, our anti-rebellion campaign this time is not only fighting for the principles of the Party, but also maintaining the country's moral principles of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame from falling," he concluded.</p>

<h3>Telegram Reporting on the War Situation</h3>
<p>Hankou Telegram: Shanghai Commander Xiong Tianyi, Mayor Zhang, Yuejun, Xunjian (seal), (1) The progress of our Pinghan armies is as follows: The Ninth Army has advanced to the line of Jiaozhuang, Liuzhuang, and Fei Yue Temple, and the Tenth Army has advanced to the line of Baizhuang and Wubanying. The 44th Division of Gouhu has occupied Zhangdian Street 4 and Wangjing Village west of Xuchang, capturing over 1,000 enemies, seizing 500 rifles, 8 machine guns, and 3 mortars. Gouzhai is a key pass west of Xuchang. With the capture of this寨, the enemy in Xuchang will fall sooner or later. (2) Receiving telegram from Commander Jiang 31, in the Qixian area, the enemy surrounded by us launched a full-scale attack last night, advancing one after another. After our officers and soldiers fought bravely and calmly, they finally defeated the rebel enemy, leaving behind corpses piled up like mountains. After the inspection, there were no fewer than four or five thousand bodies. According to the captives, the enemy in Qixian, including Ji Hongchang, Zhang Yin, Liang Guanying, and Ji Ca, were repeatedly swept by our artillery fire and machine guns, and planes</p>

It was decided to approve eleven proposals that had been reviewed and one temporary proposal. The agenda of the congress has been completed. Chairman Ren Guangyu announced the closing. In addition to sending a telegram to console the officers and soldiers fighting at the front, which was handed over to the Second Executive Committee for handling, the Congress Declaration and a quick postal telegram are recorded below: (Declaration) From the First National Congress of Party Member Representatives of our army last year until today, a year has passed. How has the revolutionary environment of our party been during this year? It goes without saying that it has been a life-and-death struggle with reactionary forces. On the reactionary side, first there was the rebellion of Li Zongren, then the declaration of war by Zhang Fakui, and then the rebellion of Feng Yuxiang and Tang Shengzhi. Now, Yan Xishan is combining Li, Zhang, Feng, Tang, and the northern warlords who have lost power for many years to resist the Central Government. What they are using as an excuse is nothing more than party orthodoxy and politics. Those who have betrayed the party and have been expelled from the party are stubbornly talking about the party, and those who have always been jealous of the party are now shamelessly joining the discussion. This is a united offensive by the reactionary elements, and it is also the final struggle of the reactionary elements. From the perspective of the revolutionary process, the emergence of reactionary elements is not unexpected. Although reactionary elements continue to emerge, they will inevitably be destroyed immediately, which is also a matter of course. And after the separate rebellions and separate destruction of each reactionary element, the final union of the reactionary is even more predictable. The result of their joint rebellion will also not escape the fate of being destroyed together. These are all clear signs of the success of the revolution, and they also show us that the elimination of counter-revolutionary forces internally has reached the final stage and is before the success of the domestic revolution. This is not enough to obscure our revolutionary ambition, but can make us more motivated and strive forward. The counter-revolutionaries Yan, Feng, Zhang, Li, Tang, etc. all use the issue of party orthodoxy as an excuse, so what they advocate and proclaim is nothing more than these two points. And the fallacy of forming another central government and setting up another government has also been clamored for a while. However, due to the conflict of private interests among them, they have never been able to reach an agreement. Today, they are just groaning incessantly. This is because of the conflict of their private interests. In fact, the legitimate central government and the legitimate government cannot be shaken by any reactionary forces. The Nanjing Central Party Headquarters was produced by the Third National Congress of our party. The Third Congress originated from the Second Congress, and the Second Congress originated from the First Congress personally convened by the Premier. The system is clear and unambiguous. The National Government in Nanjing then came from this legitimate party orthodoxy, shouldering the task of promoting revolutionary forces, accepting the Premier's will, and striving to realize it as soon as possible. Therefore, opposing the orthodox Central Party Headquarters and the legitimate National Government is a counter-revolutionary act. Our army is the revolutionary armed force, and all comrades in our army are brave warriors who are fighting to uphold the revolution. They know nothing but revolution. Anyone who obstructs the progress of the revolution and violates the legitimate Central Party Headquarters and the National Government will surely be destroyed in the morning to secure the party and the country. We hereby declare this. (Telegram) Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Party Headquarters of various provinces and cities, Governments of various provinces and cities, various armies, various railways, and special party headquarters are all addressed. The Second National Congress of Naval Representatives opened on June 2nd. According to law, Ren Guangyu, Chen Xunyong, Zheng Youyi, Chen Shaokuan, Ma Deji, Li Shijia, Wang Shouting, Li Mengbin, and Lu Deyuan were elected as executive committee members. Chen Ding, Lin Yuanquan, Ye Baoqi, Lin Shouguo, and Meng Xiuchun were elected as alternate executive committee members. Chen Jiliang, Chen Ce, Zeng Yiding, Wu Zhennan, and Zhou Zhaorui were elected as supervisory committee members, and Lin Guogeng and Yu Bangyan were elected as alternate supervisory committee members. They took office under oath on the same day. Special telegram report. Secretariat of the Second National Congress of the Navy kowtows Jiang.</p>

<h3>City Propaganda Department Propaganda Meeting</h3>
<p>Sixth Session</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department Propaganda Department held the sixth city propaganda meeting at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Chen Dezheng, Bao Rong, Xu Xingchu, and propaganda committee members from various districts, such as Yang Shaozhi, Zhu Shujian, Shen Yu, and Shen Sheng, etc., a total of more than ten people, attended. Minister Chen Dezheng presided, Zhou Hanmei recorded.

The reports from the various teams were also quite valuable. In the future, the work of investigating reactions should continue to be carried out. Propaganda work previously focused on suppression, but now focuses on consolation. Suppression work can make the rebel enemy tremble and the soldiers be used to the best of their abilities, but consolation can also inspire the soldiers and promote public morale. Recently, Wan Xuancai has been escorted to Nanjing, and the rumors from the outside have been dispelled on their own. In the future, propaganda work should shift to artistic methods. Hope for joint efforts. Subsequently, Xu Xingchu, the executive secretary of the Guidance Section, reported, briefly stating that the colleagues in the headquarters have recently intensified their efforts in cultural work. The rampant Communist Party in this port is not without reason for the rise of reactionary cultural institutions. Personnel have been dispatched to various bookstores to investigate. (Omission) Hope that various districts will also pay attention to inspection. Regarding the film aspect, the Film Inspection Committee organized by the headquarters together with the Municipal Education Bureau and the Municipal Social Bureau recently discovered two films insulting our country and has separately prohibited their screening and ordered them to be cut, and has also given detailed instructions on the future work direction.

<h3>County Second District Flat Rice Distribution Ends</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Second District public fears that this year's flat rice distribution will be distributed in accordance with the Asset Management Office's resolution, distributing money instead of rice. However, in order to prevent abuse, the procedures are quite cautious. First, each township is ordered to create a list of impoverished people, dividing them into extremely impoverished, secondarily impoverished, large families, and small families. Then, the district office sends personnel to selectively check, and those who are not impoverished are deleted, and those who were originally listed as extremely impoverished who should be changed to secondarily impoverished are adjusted accordingly. Then, the household registration books are compared, and those with inconsistent populations are corrected according to the household registration books. Those who are working elsewhere are deleted. Then, a proper register is created, and claim slips are printed and distributed to the heads of each township, who then distribute them to each impoverished household. It is also stipulated that distribution will be carried out in four locations from May 15th to May 20th. When the deadline arrives, each impoverished household will bring their slip in person to the designated location to receive the money. However, for those few impoverished households who were unable to come to the district to receive the money on time due to circumstances, in order to show compassion for the impoverished people, the deadline was extended to May 31st, allowing the impoverished households to come to the district to receive the money. Now it has been completely concluded. The very few impoverished households who have not received the money will be retained and included in the distribution at the next flat rice distribution. It is now heard that the district office has rushed to create a registration list and will print and announce it on the same day.</p>

<h3>British Overseas Celebrated the British King's Birthday Yesterday</h3>

<h3>The Market Condition of Chinese Tea and Tung Oil in the United States</h3>
<p>Report from the Resident Consulate in the United States</p>
<p>Previously, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in order to develop foreign trade, instructed various overseas consulates to collect reference materials for commodity inspection in their host countries and to investigate the trade conditions of domestic goods in those countries. Now, according to the report from the Consulate General in San Francisco, USA, the tea and tung oil items are becoming increasingly sluggish in that region and urgently need improvement. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has forwarded the report to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau for attention. The original text is excerpted as follows: "Among the domestic goods of our country in this area, tea and tung oil are the most significant. As far as tea is concerned, the market is becoming increasingly stagnant. The ports of this city and the ships going to and from our country have all switched to using Indian tea. Chinese products are declining daily. As for tung oil, although it can still maintain the status quo, it is heard that in recent years, 450,000 tung oil trees have been planted in Florida, USA. In the future, when the trees provide shade, the United States will be able to produce tung oil themselves, which will be enough to determine the fate of our country's tung oil. American merchants are now paying very little attention to our country's tung oil because: (1) the quality of Chinese tung oil is inconsistent; what is ordered today is top grade, but what is ordered tomorrow may be inferior; today's price is one thing, tomorrow's price is different, leaving American merchants at a loss; (2) our country's merchants have no representatives here to connect with merchants from all sides and promote propaganda; (3) manufacturing does not use new methods, so the goods are not refined, the quantity is not large, and the supply is not constant. The above situations are humbly reported and request review and order for improvement," etc.</p>
<h3>All Workers at Edison Factory Resume Work</h3>
<p>The workers at the General Electric Edison Bulb Factory on Robertsheng Road resumed work yesterday and went to the factory.

However, in the afternoon, a worker named Bu Xianyi was accused by Gong Xigen of assault and battery, resulting in head injuries. The police were notified to arrest him and take him to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, where the district chief interrogated him and sent him to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3>Workers at Yipin Factory Resume Work Immediately After Slowdown</h3>
<p>Workers at the Yipin Brick and Tile Factory in Caojiadu Zhoujiaqiao expressed dissatisfaction with the factory's new work regulations and slowed down work yesterday afternoon. After receiving the news, the district chief of the Sixth District Public Security Bureau immediately led the police to mediate, earnestly explaining the new regulations to the workers. The workers agreed to a one-month trial period and immediately resumed work.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Rice Subsidy Resolved</h3>
<p>In September of last year, the Shanghai Navigation General Office represented the seamen in requesting a salary increase from the shipping companies. More than half a year passed without resolution. It was not until March 24 of this year that the companies contacted the Seamen's Union for discussions. The foreign shipping companies refused to raise salaries due to sluggish business. On March 31, the Sanbei Company took the initiative to add a rice subsidy of two yuan per month for stokers and sailors. Foreign companies such as Nisshin, Taikoo, and Jardine also followed suit, providing rice subsidies according to the Sanbei method. The three foreign shipping companies notified Yu Qiaqing. However, salary increases were difficult to implement. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also issued a notice stating that starting this month, the stokers and sailors of each ship would also receive an additional rice subsidy of two yuan per month. The seamen's request for a salary increase was finally settled.</p>

<h3>The Luoping Ship Dispute Resolved</h3>
<p>The case of Norwegian merchant ship "Luoping," whose owner, Edison, violated the contract and fired Chinese workers Liu Sheng and others, was previously submitted by the Seamen's Union to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to handle it. The case has been reported previously. It is now found that the case was resolved between labor and management on May 29. The union submitted a reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for record. The original text is as follows: "According to your Ministry's approval, approval number 49, in addition to the original document on file to avoid redundancy, after opening the submission, it has been transferred to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for investigation and handling. I have been informed, etc. In accordance with this, the union immediately sent staff to the Municipal Government to handle the matter. However, because the union did not receive the approval order, the union saw that the workers had stopped working for two weeks and that the ship was about to set sail, so the secretary, Zhao Shiming, was sent to negotiate first. Later, he replied that he had gone to the ship and the manager of the Laici Company, and negotiated repeatedly with the Norwegian Consul in Shanghai. The shipowner and manager had agreed to make a written statement not to dismiss the workers again. The shipowner was fierce and cunning and could not guarantee that he would not break his promise again. He would rather resign and make other plans. Therefore, the workers proposed the following conditions: (1) in addition to paying the wages for the previous fifty days of work, another month's wages should be paid; (2) 25 return tickets to Shantou should be purchased; (3) 75 yuan should be given for food and lodging in Shanghai while waiting for the ship; (4) 25 yuan should be given for food and drink on the return ship to Shantou. After repeated negotiations with the shipowner, the union finally agreed to implement the conditions. The workers all expressed their willingness to accept the conditions, and the case was concluded. It is appropriate to report for inspection and record," etc. According to this, it is appropriate to submit a written report to your Ministry, asking for inspection and record, etc.</p>

<h3>Major Robbery in Pudong</h3>
<h3>Inside Story Revealed</h3>
<p>A Large Amount of Military Firepower Seized in Xiaohong, Pudong, is Related to the Stolen Military Firepower from the Customs. The Canvas Bags are Confirmed to be from the River Conservancy Bureau. An Old Woman and a Man are Captured Simultaneously.</p>
<p>The River Conservancy Bureau's Lifeng small ferry was robbed of a large sum of money at the Huangpu Wharf in East Shanghai on the 30th of last month, and one Chinese and one Westerner were shot and killed, and two Chinese and one Westerner were injured. After the incident, the water and land police successively arrested many suspects in the case. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the Customs Water Patrol Police continued to report from informants that the main culprit of the case lived at No. 89 Dongyangjiazhai, Pudong. The head of the police then ordered detectives Ge Changsheng, Cheng Yongnian, Huang Zhenlin, etc. at 8:00 a.m. yesterday to request the assistance of the Pudong Third District Public Security Bureau. The district chief immediately dispatched detective Zhang Yong, Yang Jinsheng, etc. to assist the Fourth Detachment of the Lujiazai Police, together with Captain Zhu and Officer Shu, to lead the police to the address for arrest. When they arrived, they found the house empty. Only an old woman was inside to take care of the house. When questioned, she stated her name was Yang Zhang, a local, 54 years old. Her husband's name was Jin Gui, who died of illness on the third day of this month (i.e., May 30) at 4:00 p.m., etc. The detectives interrogated her again, and she confessed that her nephew, Jin Sheng (nicknamed "Long-Legged Jin Sheng"), had come to notify her through Yang Zhangnu's daughter, Gengen, this morning to discard a large number of bullets in the Xiaohong in front of the door, and she did not know the rest. The detectives then retrieved three handbags and more than 200 small white canvas bags from the Hong. They also found 340 rounds of .45 caliber pistol bullets and 120 rounds of .38 caliber pistol bullets. At the same time, they dug up a .2026 caliber six-round pistol next to the manure pit. The detectives recognized that the handbags and canvas bags were indeed used by the River Conservancy Bureau for paying salaries. The bullets were also the same as those used in the shooting of the Chinese and Westerners. The bullets and the pistol were similar to the guns and bullets stolen from the Lujiazui Customs warehouse (the case was reported in this newspaper on May 30). Therefore, the detectives believed that the case was becoming more serious, so they re-entered the house next door, No. 90, and searched the house again. They found a set of stoker's blue overalls and a ten-yuan note from the Zhongnan Bank, and four silver dollars. The detectives determined that the overalls were indeed worn by one of the robbers during the robbery. At this point, the evidence became more obvious. They detained Yang Zhang and went to Yang Zhangnu's house at No. 351 nearby (her daughter, Gengen, was the one who Yang Zhang said had instructed her to discard the bullets in the Hong in the morning). They found a bucket that was used by the robbers to carry the large sum of money to the Kechi Iron Factory wharf next to the Tai Tong Stock, and the money was hidden in the bucket, covered with other items to avoid the eyes of passersby. They then arrested Yang Zhang along with the stolen goods. At that time, a man greeted Zhang, and he was also arrested by the detectives and taken to the Third District. After District Chief Zhang interrogated the case, Yang Zhang confessed that after her husband died on May 30, her nephew Jin Sheng had given her 95 silver dollars for funeral expenses. However, the guns and bullets were brought to her empty house by her nephew Jin Sheng and three strangers around 8:00 a.m. on that day (May 30). One of the three men was a fat man. She did not know where Jin Sheng lived. The man who was arrested together claimed that his name was Ni Buxiang, 21 years old, from Yancheng, living in Yongxingli, Wuzhou Road, and working as a worker in the British American Tobacco Company. He did not know why he was arrested. District Chief Zhang verified the confessions and ordered that the people and the stolen goods be sent to the Public Security Bureau General Bureau for disposal.</p>
<p>Report in the Western Newspapers: The Wenhui Daily reported that, regarding the Lifeng small ferry robbery case, the police, based on a tip, searched a house in Pudong today (3rd) together with the Chinese police. They found numerous bullets in the pond in front of the house, and their caliber was consistent with the guns used by the robbers. However, no pistols were found. In addition, they also found many empty silver bags in the pond. Since the name of the culprit was not found, no one was arrested. Owen, the Westerner who was injured in the case, is still in critical condition in the Public Concession Hospital and has not improved.</p>

<h3>Conflict Between Police and Merchants in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Shops on Xiangshan Road Go on Strike</p>
<p>Dismissal of a Police Officer Resolves the Issue</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a conflict between police and merchants occurred on Xiangshan Road, Baoshan Road, North Shanghai. Due to a misunderstanding, the shops closed their doors in succession. Fortunately, Niu Kaiping, a patrol officer from the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, intervened to persuade them, and the shops reopened. The conflict was resolved peacefully. The details of the incident are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cause of the Conflict: At about 11:00 a.m. yesterday, the Shen Tai Rice Shop at No. 78 Xiangshan Road was receiving 14 shi of rice. When the cart arrived at the shop door, it was unloaded and piled up in front of the door. Xiao Rongguang, a patrol officer No. 33 from the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau, who was guarding the area, saw that the rice bags were blocking the street and hindering traffic, and ordered the shop to move them quickly. The clerk in the shop said that they would move them after finishing lunch. Xiao refused, and an argument broke out with Sun Shaoqiu, the young boss of the Shen Tai Shop, and then they began to fight each other. Just then, the police changed shifts, and the scope of the conflict became larger.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Bystanders Affected: When the fight between the police and merchants broke out, the road was crowded with onlookers, some scolding Xiao for being barbaric, and others criticizing Sun for being brave. At that time, Wang Yunting, a resident on the upper floor of the Mao Sheng Yong Hotel across the street, shouted loudly from the roof, saying that they could go to the bureau to reason, etc. Later, the police took Sun, Wang, and others to the district.</p>
<p>Shops on Strike: After the incident, the shops on Xiangshan Road, Shen Tai, Mao Sheng Yong, etc., closed their doors one after another at about 12:00 p.m. and rushed to the bureau to investigate how the matter would be resolved. The order was quite chaotic for a while, and the road was also crowded with people.</p>
<p>Peaceful Resolution: When the two parties arrived at the bureau, the district chief was at lunch and not present. The interrogation was conducted by patrol officer Niu Kaiping, who questioned the two parties in detail. He learned that the incident was due to a misunderstanding on both sides and believed that Xiao's actions were inappropriate. He persuaded Sun Shaoqiu, the owner of the Shen Tai Shop, to return to the shop and dismissed the police officer Xiao Rongguang on the spot. Patrol officer Niu also went to Xiangshan Road with Yang, a member of the Fifth District Party Department, to persuade the shops to reopen. The shops expressed satisfaction with Niu's fair handling of the matter. At 2:30 p.m., the shops on Xiangshan Road all reopened for business, and a peaceful resolution was achieved.</p>
<h3>Sentence of Death Case Imminent</h3>
<p>The Deceased's Wife's Testimony Ambiguous</p>
<p>The Defendant Firmly Claims to be Xia Shaozeng</p>
<p>Sun Shiba, a native of Hefei, is suspected of using an axe to kill his elder brother, Sun Shilin, inside house number 1753 of Yinghua Lane on Robison Road in western Shanghai at approximately 5:00 AM on February 12th of this year. He was arrested by detectives Ma Mouxiang and Kong Qingping from the Putuo Road Police Station. At the time, Sun Shiba's mother, Sun Xia, and wife, Sun Zhu, attempted to intervene, biting the detectives' hands and tearing their clothes, so they were also arrested and handed over to the Special District Local Court. Sun Shiba denied his name and claimed to be Xia Shaozeng. After repeated interrogations, the police presented evidence proving that the defendant was indeed Sun Shiba and summoned the deceased's wife, Sun Wang, twice, but she failed to appear. It was ordered that she be taken into custody. All of these matters have been reported in this newspaper. Recently, Chinese and Western detectives arrested Sun Wang and questioned her once. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court to continue the interrogation, and Prosecutor Guo Huaipu also attended to perform his duties. First, Sun Wang stated in her testimony that she was from Hefei, 31 years old, her husband's name was Sun Shilin, and the defendant in custody was named Xia Shaozeng. Judge Wu then questioned Sun Wang, saying, "You were taken into custody because you failed to appear twice after being summoned. Last Saturday afternoon, when you were questioned, you stated that your husband's younger brother was named Sun Shiba. At that time, you were shown the photograph from the reward notice, and you immediately stated that it was Sun Shiba and that you had never seen Xia Shaozeng before. However, that photograph is of the defendant's face. Since you say you have never met Xia Shaozeng, why do you say today that the defendant is Xia Shaozeng?" The photograph was then reissued to her for review. She answered ambiguously, saying that she had been confused and talking nonsense in court last time because she was frightened (in reality, it was because Sun Wang and Sun Xia were held together in the women's prison, and Sun Xia had coached her on what to say). Then, the clerk Gao Yiqun read aloud Sun Wang's testimony from the previous interrogation. Judge Wu questioned her again, but she still gave evasive answers, not answering the questions asked, as if she had a mental illness. Then, Sun Shiba was questioned, and he still firmly claimed to be Xia Shaozeng, disclaiming any knowledge of what was asked in court. Sun Xia and Sun Zhu also gave many evasive answers. Even when Judge Wu threw down the photograph, ordering the three defendants to look at it, Sun Shiba and Sun Zhu only glanced at it and said they did not recognize it. Only Sun Xia said that she was old and her eyesight was poor, so she could not see clearly. At this point, the questioning of the witnesses was completed, and it was ordered that arguments be presented. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, and the defense lawyers appointed by the defendant, Luo Jiaheng and Yu Congdao, stood up one after another and made lengthy arguments. Finally, Prosecutor Guo expressed his opinion, stating that this case was a serious murder case, and there were still many doubts regarding whether the defendant's name was Sun Shiba or Xia Shaozeng, and whether the murderer was Sun Shiba. Since Sun Shiba and Sun Xia were mother and son, there should be a blood relationship, which should be proven by other methods or scientific means. According to the law, the time limit for investigating criminal cases is two months, but in this case, only a little over a month has passed, so there is still a need for further investigation. Therefore, according to the prosecutor's opinion, the time for closing arguments has not yet arrived, and the charges of obstructing official duties against Sun Xia and Sun Zhu are also deemed untenable. Judge Wu then declared the closing arguments in this case to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the afternoon of June 10th. The defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>
<p>Dai Cuidi, a Married Woman</p>
<h3>Sues for Inheritance of Her Mother's Family Estate</h3>
<p>Accuses Her Elder Brother, Dai Gengxin</p>
<p>Demands Re-analysis of Public Property</p>
<p>Dai Gengxin is one of the wealthy merchants and magnates in Shanghai, and he also founded the Huacheng Tobacco Company. Now, due to inheritance disputes, his sister, Cuidi, has filed a lawsuit against him in the Special District Local Court. According to the case, Dai's father, named Yunlai, had four sons and three daughters. Gengxin was the second son, also known as Fangda. His eldest brother was named Junda, his younger brother was named Kuida, and his youngest brother was named Shengda, also known as Genghua. His eldest daughter was named Cuidi, the second was named Cuie, and the third was named Cuijuan. Cuidi was betrothed to a Lu family. On July 25th of the Republic of China's eighth year, Dai's father passed away, leaving an estate of over a million. Gengxin and his brothers then analyzed the estate together, dividing it into fifteen shares. The four brothers each received two and a half shares. Gengxin's adopted son, Yulin, who was recognized as a family grandson, received two shares. The remaining three shares were allocated as follows: two shares were allocated to the public account property, and one share was allocated to the establishment of a charity school, etc. At that time, the laws regarding women inheriting property had not yet been established, so the three daughters did not receive a drop of benefit. However, last spring, Gengxin and his brothers redistributed the two public properties that were originally designated for the public and for the construction of the righteous school and the two properties were divided equally among his two unmarried sisters, Cuie and Cuijuan. But, Cuidi who was already married, did not benefit. At that time, Cuidi did not claim her right, because she was already married, and women had no right to inherit the estate. Later, she learned that the National Government promulgated the implementing rules for women to retroactively inherit property on August 19th of that year. She realized that married women enjoyed the same rights as unmarried women, without any distinction. She then negotiated with her brothers, demanding that the public property they had divided, amounting to over 110,000 yuan, be re-analyzed, but the issue was not resolved for a long time. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Dai Gengxin, Genghua, and Yulin for division of property, because Junda and Kuida had already passed away, so they were not listed as defendants. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong opened the court for a joint hearing. The defendants hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Jiang Baoli to argue that when Yunlai passed away, the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang were not yet under the jurisdiction of the National Government, which did not meet the requirements for married women to retroactively inherit property. Although the public account property and the charity school fund had specified uses, the distribution document stated that the defendants would take turns managing the property and any excess profit would be distributed by shares. That the defendants own the shared property, which means the plaintiff has no right to claim the inheritance. Lawyers Jiang and Jiang requested that the original suit should be rejected and rebutted. The plaintiff's lawyer first presented the facts of the case and then elaborated on the reasons for demanding a re-analysis. Lawyers Jiang and Jiang reiterated the reason for dividing the property between Cuie and Cuijuan and that they had been given to them as dowries of 15,000 yuan each. Cuie is now married and Cuijuan will soon be sent to marry as well. The Plaintiff's family is rich and she is taken care of, so it is not necessary for her to file a dispute and hurt family sentiments. After the lawyers finished their arguments, Judge Xu stated that a judgment will be announced on the morning of the ninth of this month.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau, Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau, Shanghai Special Municipality Executive Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special Municipality Public Security Bureau, and Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau jointly issue a proclamation stating: It has been found that cholera (commonly known as "fa sha") often occurs in this city during the summer and autumn seasons, which is a great harm to the citizens. It is especially easy to spread in places where many people gather. Prior prevention cannot be neglected. In order to protect the health of citizens and curb the outbreak of this severe infectious disease, the Health Bureau is promoting free cholera prevention injections. All factories, businesses, schools, and groups with large numbers of people, as well as all shantytowns, must be vaccinated against cholera. This will not only protect their own health and prevent infection but also reduce the opportunity for the epidemic to spread and eliminate its root causes. This beneficial preventive injection should be implemented jointly, and there is no need to spend any money. The Party Headquarters, Social Affairs Bureau, Public Security Bureau, Education Bureau, and Health Bureau will jointly discuss and supervise the implementation of various measures and conduct inspections at any time. Therefore, all factories, businesses, schools, groups, and shantytowns in the city are hereby notified that when the Health Bureau sends personnel to administer cholera prevention injections, they must all be vaccinated without refusal. The responsible personnel of each factory, business, school, and group must earnestly supervise and encourage their staff and students and must not neglect the epidemic prevention duties of their employees and students or be indifferent. Obey this proclamation! May 14th of the 19th year of the Republic of China. Director of the Education Bureau, Chen Dezheng. Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Pan Gongzhan. Standing Committee Members of the Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee, Pan Gongzhan, Fan Zhengbo, Wu Bokang. Director of the Public Security Bureau, Yuan Liang. Director of the Health Bureau, Hu Hongji.</p>

<p>General Motors Shanghai</p>
<h3>Mr. Christie's Talk on Economical Transportation</h3>
<p>Mr. Christie, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the American General Motors Manufacturing Company, published an article yesterday on economical transportation, and his words are of great value, so we hereby record them. The article states: "Commerce and economy are mutually linked and deeply related. However, the most important industry for the economic development of a country is the automobile industry. Without the assistance of the automobile industry, social economy would be weak and sluggish, like a tree without deep roots, withered and unable to grow. General Motors Corporation of the United States, in view of this, has been working hard to promote the automobile industry and spares no effort. It has always taken the development of China's economy and commerce as its own responsibility. Its recent proposal to develop China's commercial automobile transportation plan is a fundamental step. General Motors is now focusing on promoting various General Motors trucks, and the results are very good. The scope has expanded, and General Motors managers are present in countries all over the world, including all provinces in China. Based on this, it can be inferred that after the development of automobile transportation, commercial operations will surely be more prosperous. General Motors Corporation, for the sake of prudence, does not dare to act rashly in promoting commercial automobile transportation and advocates proceeding step by step and following the trend. Therefore, the employees hired by General Motors are all experts who are familiar with commercial situations and the needs of automobile transportation. In addition, all General Motors products are of high quality, durable, and of genuine value for money. All purchasers of General Motors passenger and cargo vehicles know that they are powerful and cost-effective tools for commercial transportation. In today's era of fierce industrial and commercial competition, everything requires speed, so automobile transportation has become a necessity. The current use of cattle and horses to transport goods is no longer suitable for business. General Motors firmly believes that cargo automobiles, if purchased by all sectors of industry and commerce, will have a great effect and bring many benefits, and is indeed a type of 'economical transportation.' Judging from the recent promotion situation, the policies adopted by General Motors are upright, benefit society, and promote industry and commerce. The future of automobile transportation can be predicted to be successful."</p>
<h3>Ye Youcai Extortion Case Trial</h3>
<p>Wu Zhangshi Released for Lack of Involvement</p>
<p>Wang Shoulian et al. Rescheduled for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Ye Youcai, the manager of the Huasheng Electric Appliance Factory on Zhoujiazui Road, who lives on Zhaofeng Road, was robbed of his property at gunpoint on the night of April 30th, losing 700 yuan. Not long after, he was extorted of 300 yuan by blackmailers. Furthermore, from the 3rd to the 12th of last month, Ye and another manager of the factory, Cao Yugui, both received threatening letters demanding 20,000 yuan. They reported the matter to the Huishan Police Station, which sent detectives to the agreed location to apprehend the criminals. Zuo Qijun, Lu Xiuqing, Xue San, Sun Sankai, Zhou Shuli, and a woman named Wu Zhangshi were successively captured. However, Zuo and Xue attempted to escape and were shot and wounded by the detectives and sent to the hospital for treatment. The rest were sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation. The details have been reported in previous issues. It is now known that Wang Shoulian, a native of Jiangbei, was apprehended by the Gordon Road Police Station in connection with the Ye family robbery case. Under investigation, it was determined that, with the exception of Wu Zhangshi, Zuo and the others were all involved in the case. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng opened the court to continue the interrogation. Zuo and Xue were still injured, and the other defendants were also brought to court. The police lawyer briefly described the police investigation and requested the withdrawal of the charges against Wu Zhangshi. Next, the plaintiff, Ye Youcai, appeared in court and described the circumstances of being robbed and extorted, and identified Wang Shoulian among the defendants as the robber present at the scene. Ye's chauffeur, Yuan Asan, testified that after his employer received the threatening letter, he was ordered to take 300 yuan in cash to the agreed location in Lujiazha Bay in the French Concession. At that time, Wang Shoulian came to collect the money, and the money was handed over to him. When questioned, Wang Shoulian admitted to robbing Ye's family of clothes and valuables but claimed that the extortion was carried out by his accomplices and that he was not involved. Lu Xiuqing and the others continued to deny the charges. Judge Feng ordered Wu Zhangshi to be released first and ordered that Wang and the other defendants be returned to custody and that the interrogation be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Autopsy of the Tragic Assault on Qiu Atu</h3>
<p>Li Ashi, a Natural Shaker</p>
<p>Possessing a Handgun Without a License</p>
<p>Qiu Guiquan, a native of Ningbo, 43 years old, a laundry worker living in a flat in Chenjia Lane near Foch Road in the French Concession, who works in the residence of a Western foreman from the Xiangmao Soap Factory had one son and one daughter. At about 6:45 PM the night before last, when Qiu had not returned from work and his wife, Xia, was visiting a sick neighbor, his son, Ashi (the only adopted son of the third branch of his family), was having dinner at a small table in front of the door with his sister, Mao Mao. Suddenly, Li Atu (31 years old), a local resident who owns a flower garden on Foch Road, arrived and pulled out a handgun, pointing it at Qiu's child in jest. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew out, hitting the child's right hand and passing through it, directly entering his mouth and piercing the back of his head. Blood gushed from the wound like a spring. Qiu's wife heard the noise and ran over to see, the child had already fallen to the ground, and then passed away. She immediately grabbed the murderer, Li Atu. While they were arguing and crying, an old widow, the second landlord surnamed Chen, came forward to mediate, allowing Li to take the opportunity to escape. His body was immediately transported to the hall for examination. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Division of the French Concession Police reported to the French Court Judge Zhu Cheng to preside. At 11:00 noon, he arrived at the hall and investigated the matter. Ascending the public chair, Judge Zhu, listened to the detective's report of the previous situation, and questioned the family of the deceased. Judge Zhu found that the deceased Qiu Atu had died of a gunshot wound. He ordered that a photograph be taken and that the family of the deceased be allowed to collect the body for burial, and ordered the police to pursue the murderer, and sent to the court for interrogation. After the examination, the body's mother requested that the body be returned for burial, but the official rejected it on the grounds that it violated the regulations of the concession and ordered that it be buried today. It is reported that the murderer, Li Atu, although he owns a flower garden, is very reckless by nature. He purchased a handgun after a fight with someone, but he did not have a license. The second landlord surnamed Chen, the old woman who mediated and caused Li to escape, has also fled.</p>
<h3>Child Laborer Dies Tragically After Being Bitten by a Mad Dog</h3>

His father had passed away, and he lived with his mother and brothers at 66 Xihuan Road in Wusong. Three weeks ago, while going to work, he encountered a mad dog near the Ji'an Workshop, which pounced directly on the child laborer's face, biting his eyes and other areas. Although he went home that day and told his mother, she did not pay much attention because the injuries were not very serious. Unexpectedly, the poison flared up the day before yesterday, and he felt extremely uncomfortable in his chest and other areas, his eyes turned red, and his hands and feet shook incessantly. His mother was shocked when she saw this and immediately took a train to Shanghai for treatment at a certain hospital. He returned home in the evening, but the poison had penetrated too deeply, and the poison became severe in the middle of the night. He trembled all over, his face was ferocious, and he felt very miserable. Before dawn, he died. His mother, witnessing this scene, cried incessantly. After repeated persuasion from the neighbors, she purchased a coffin and collected the body in the afternoon. It was truly a tragedy.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Bare Chests and Bare Backs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Director Yuan has issued a special order, stating that now that the summer season has arrived, there are many ignorant men and women in the streets and alleys who walk around bare-chested or bare-armed, and many people cool off along the streets. If this is not cracked down on, it will not only be detrimental to the view but also affect public morals and hygiene. Therefore, he has specially ordered all districts and teams under his jurisdiction to instruct their respective chiefs to comply. Whenever the above situation is encountered, they should be immediately detained and severely punished to eliminate bad habits and rectify national integrity.</p>

<p>Gao Fusheng, a local worker at a factory located at number 641 Julaida Road in the French Concession, was recently beaten with weapons by his colleagues Zhang Junde and Zhu Zhongsu and others after an argument over a trivial matter, resulting in a head injury and severe bleeding. The patrol officers arrived and took Zhang and the others into custody at the police station and sent them to the French Concession Court. Because the plaintiff's injuries had not healed, he was treated in the hospital and the case was put on hold. Yesterday, because the plaintiff's injuries had healed, the police sent Zhang and the others back to the court for questioning. The plaintiff stated the circumstances of the beating, and Zhang Junde and Zhu Zhongsu testified that the plaintiff had started the fight and that they had called on others to retaliate by beating him.

The association telegraphed County Chief Meng and the Disaster Relief Branch to maintain the handling. It was replied that the misunderstanding had been resolved and the disaster relief work was completely completed, and gratitude was expressed. (4) Director Zhu telegraphed that the disaster relief fields in the Xing disaster relief branch had been safely completed. District 123 will be opened in the city on the 23rd. (5) Director Liu Shulun reported on the disaster relief work in Bao'ying and Huai'an counties and stated that the eastern border of Suqian was severely flooded and there was no wheat harvest. At the same time, the western border was attacked by bandits, who burned and killed dozens of villages. He pleaded for immediate disaster relief. (6) The amount of disaster relief funds received this week. Matters for discussion: (1) The Jiangpu County Chief replied that the county's disaster relief funds were intended to be used to issue additional disaster relief funds to the poorest people on the winter disaster relief register, with each household receiving at least two yuan or more. After the autumn harvest, during the agricultural slack season, the township chiefs would be responsible for supervising the recipients to repair county-owned roads. Please allocate the 5,000 yuan. Is it permissible to proceed as planned? The public decided to proceed as planned. (2) The Provincial Disaster Relief Association telegraphed the county chiefs of Shuyang and Dongtai, requesting that the association be contacted to quickly distribute the funds in a scattered manner. Should personnel be sent? The public decided that Dongtai would wait for the Finance Department's reply to arrive at the association before telegraphing Director Zhu to handle the matter. Shuyang will be handed over to the county government to supervise and coordinate with the Chamber of Commerce. (3) Mr. Qi Yisan from Yancheng wrote that it would be a good idea to manage the Tianfei Gate dredging project. The association had previously approved the allocation of 4,500 yuan to the county from the Provincial Disaster Relief Association, which had been used to cover expenses. In addition, the 1,850 yuan donated by various philanthropists to the county for porridge relief was also remitted to the Red Cross Society for investigation and distribution. If the construction disaster relief is deemed necessary, should additional assistance be considered? The public decided that, in addition to the specified porridge relief funds that had been handed over to the Red Cross Branch, an additional 2,500 yuan would be provided for construction disaster relief and Qi would be informed. (4) The association has a large number of funds to be issued, and a comprehensive calculation shows that approximately 30,000 yuan is urgently needed to cope. Donations have become scarce. How should funds be raised immediately? The public decided to telegraph Director Chen, urging him to allocate funds and describing the flood and bandit disasters in Suqian in the telegram.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Girls' School Holds a Meeting to Welcome Them</h3>

Principal Lu Lihua gave a welcome speech, followed by a reply from Ms. Huang Ruoqiu, a representative of the team and a tennis player. She said that Chinese women's sports are behind, in fact, men's sports are also. So the team from a women's normal school came north from thousands of miles away. The first point is to visit and learn, to take the good from other places to improve women's sports in Guangdong. They will compete with teams from various places, not caring about winning or losing, but to make up for our shortcomings with the strengths of others. The second point is to connect with Jiangsu and Zhejiang emotionally. Chinese women's schools are located in the north and south and rarely communicate. The third point is the hope that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang teams can go to Guangdong to give guidance, benefiting each other. It is extremely hopeful. It is a pity that they cannot go to Beiping and Liaodong this time. Afterwards, the students from the two schools jointly participated in various entertainment activities, filling the entire room with laughter. The two school teams took a group photo and dispersed.

<h3>Men's Volleyball First Game between Philippines and Japan</h3>
<p>2-0 Philippines Wins (Xu Minhui)</p>
<p>Tokyo Report - The women's competition on the 24th has ended. After a brief pause, the men's competition will continue. The registration and selection of the location. After the various procedures are prepared, the bell rings twice, and the silver horn sounds, and the two armies begin to compete.</p>
<h3>First Game...Philippines First Victory</h3>
<p>In the first game, the Philippine team attacked first. The first general served the ball and rushed through the Japanese formation. The Japanese team counterattacked. After two or three rounds, although the Japanese army was brave and each skill was quite good, after all, they were new to the scene. Approaching the enemy, the formation was scattered, and some team members did not know how to act. Therefore, the Philippine team took advantage and scored two points in a row. The Japanese army desperately tried to regain the ball. The two armies fought fiercely for three or four rounds. Although there were four serves, the Japanese team still had zero points. Although the team had veterans, there was not much progress. At this point, the order in the Japanese army gradually improved, and the military appearance was quite impressive. They used the method of attacking east and striking west, which was quite effective once or twice. The Philippine army knew the enemy's strategy and ordered General Shanbi Dao (named for his height and long arms) to strictly guard the border. The Japanese were newcomers after all. Since the Philippine Islands issued martial law, they could not cross the Lei Pool for one step. Several splits were all closed by General Shanbi personally. The two teams attacked and defended each other. The attack and the block were quite impressive. The result of the struggle was very close. As a result, the Philippine team won with a score of 21 to 18. After a fierce struggle, it ended in failure.</p>
<h3>Second Game...Japanese Side Loses Again</h3>
<p>In the second game, the Japanese tried their best to try to save the situation. At the beginning, the momentum was surging, and all the battles were won. Seeing that the situation was not good, the guest army also used its full strength to resist the enemy. They competed and fought against each other, and they were equal to each other. At 13 points, the scores were equal. At 14 points, the scores were also equal. However, from then on, the Japanese army was depressed and lost its fighting ability. There was no hope of scoring any more points. As a result, it was still 21 to 14. This battle came to an end. Looking at this game, the Japanese people's ball skills have indeed made great progress. Each technique is quite impressive. Although they have practiced the methods of formation and offense and defense, they have not seen them purely and lack experience. This is the main reason for their failure. Although the Philippine team won this time, their ball skills were unremarkable. There were many veterans, so they were very experienced. The main force of the entire team was concentrated on General Shanbi in the middle of the net. This gentleman was tall and long, and he was best at splitting the net ball. "Smooth balls" over the net were also a hundred hits. Most of the points were scored by this gentleman. Moreover, he made great contributions by closing the door when splitting the ball against the team. He was truly the pillar of the Philippine team.</p>
<p>In addition, the right net was quite lively, and the closure was also quite effective. The second-way general was quite good at splitting the ball. Weifei's team tactics focused on the second-way lifting ball, and the splitting ball in the middle of the net. This was the only way for the Philippine Islands to score points, so there were very few opportunities for the second-way middle to split the ball. Other team members have a sigh of no use for their heroes. In terms of the whole team, the skill of saving the ball is pure, the experience is very rich, and they are not surprised when they are in battle. This is their strength.</p>
<p>From this point of view, our country's volleyball is very promising. If we can gather the two generals on the left and right of the road in the net and monitor the long general, and do not allow him to cross the Lei Pool for one step, the opportunity for the Philippine team to score will be less. This is the defensive method that our team should take. As for the offensive method, we should focus on the right-wing concentrated attack. There is no need to use the method of attacking east and striking west, because this method is unstable. I am afraid that it will be counterproductive and follow the same path as the 7th Far Eastern Games. If the opponent concentrates on the left net, you can change the left-wing concentrated attack, or you can use the method of exchanging the left and right wings to attack, so that the opponent has no time to take care of it, and order the middle net to run around frequently. On the one hand, it can reduce its resistance ability, and at the same time, it can make the long general tired and reduce its attack ability. If you can say and do this strategy, it will not be difficult to win the championship.</p>
<p>First China-Philippines men's volleyball game</p>
<p>2-0...Philippines wins China (Xu Minhui)</p>
<p>(Tokyo Newsletter) The first China-Philippines men's volleyball game was held on the afternoon of the 26th. The audience believed that this curtain was the most important key to the Far Eastern Volleyball Game. Therefore, although it was delayed until 3:40 due to heavy rain, the visitors were still exceptionally crowded. According to the Philippines-Japan game and the usual practice test, the Chinese team has a great advantage in skills. However, the Philippine team is also an old soldier of the Far East. Their experience and calmness cannot be underestimated.</p>
<h3>(1) Situation in the First Game</h3>
<p>With the sound of the silver horn, the two armies engaged. The Chinese team's momentum was fierce, scoring two points in a row. Before long, the Philippine team also scored one point. Then there were wins for each side. When Xu Heng served, he scored four points in a row. The Philippine team also caught up with two points. Li Fushen added another point, and the score became ten to six. The Philippine team's three-way right wing served fiercely, taking four points in a row and making the score equal to the Chinese team. China made another effort and took a point, taking an eleven-point lead. The situation changed again, and Wu Yongqin scored two points, while the Philippine team's three-way left wing caught up with three points. The atmosphere in the entire arena became more tense. The Chinese support team kept cheering non-stop. The two teams fought harder, splitting each other and closing the door. The Philippine long general repeatedly wanted to score points, but was monitored by the Chinese team Li Xu. Every time he split the ball and hit the ball smoothly, he could not benefit. Fortunately, his teammates saved the ball quickly, so he did not fail. They changed their strategy and focused on the left and right wing split ball method. When serving in the second road, they scored three points in a row. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Chinese team changed its formation to defend against the enemy. The enemy's spirit was slightly killed, and Chen Xibing's service regained two points. The Philippine team's formation changed from time to time, or used two-wing flanking attacks, or used middle-net split attacks. The Chinese team knew the enemy's plan well and had already taken precautions, so their plan could not be accepted. Although the Philippine team had a ratio of 18 to 13, they had made no progress at all. When Li Lianying served, Chen Xibing split several balls in a row, and the Philippine team's formation was in chaos. Li took the opportunity to serve quickly, and the enemy was panicked and won five points in a row. The ratio was 18 to 18. The Philippine team then announced a ceasefire to discuss methods to defend against the enemy, and also to calm the military's heart. At the time of continued battle, the fruit will defeat the Li army. The two armies fought for a long time, and the bystanders cheered and cheered, each gritting their teeth, wishing they could join the battle group to help them succeed. Chinese team Xu Heng scored another point, and the shouts became louder. However, the Philippine team's left net scored two points in a row at this time, and the sound of the cheers became louder again. China, China, the sound also followed. Li Fushen also scored one point, and the score became twenty equal. The two teams were extremely anxious at this point, tremblingly, splitting each other, blocking each other, closing the door, and saving each other. The killing was high-spirited and cheerful, and the whole game was the focus. The two teams failed to score several times. Finally, the Philippine team's three-way middle scored two points in a row, and the Philippine team won the first game 22 to 20.</p>
<h3>(II) Second Game Battle Situation</h3>
<p>During the break, our team held a military meeting and dispatched the left-wing general of the second route to attack the city. Although we had lost one game, our pride did not diminish. We firmly believed that we would win the final victory without a doubt. Unexpectedly, we suffered a setback at the beginning of the second game, with the Philippine team's left wing of the third route scoring three points in a row. Our team's Cao Tingzan bravely scored one point, but the ball was taken away by the Philippine team again. Their right wing of the second route scored three points in a row, and our team's Chen Xibing regained two points. Their center of the second route scored another three points, and the left wing of the second route scored one point. Our team made many round trips but failed to score. Finally, the Philippine team's eldest son scored one point, making the score eleven to three. The spectators were greatly disappointed. The reinforcements quickly cheered us on. The Philippine team's eldest son scored another point. Fortunately, Qiu Guangxie's left-wing outflanking repeatedly made remarkable achievements, and Chen Xibing's right-wing attack was also quite successful. The Philippine team suffered repeated defeats, and countless soldiers died. Our army's Chen Congchao seized the opportunity to advance fiercely and won three points in a row. Qiu Guangxie, Cao Tingzan, and Chen Xibing also fiercely attacked the enemy, each scoring one point. Zhu Zucheng was even more unstoppable, breaking through the enemy's formation and scoring four points in a row. In this battle, our team relied on the flanking tactics on both wings to make the enemy lose sight of the left and right, and focus on one thing and lose sight of the other. In addition, the Flying General (Cao Tingzan) unleashed his power at this point, and the enemy was terrified at the sound, so we scored ten points in a row, leaping from twelve to three to thirteen all. At that time, the people's spirits were high and the morale was high, which goes without saying. It is a pity that our defense was weak, and the enemy repeatedly took advantage of it, either on the left, or on the right, or in front, or behind, leaving our three defenders scrambling left and right, but still unable to remedy the situation. This was because the shoes were slippery after the rain, and our steps were not agile, which was indeed our team's weakness. From then on, our team's attacking power suddenly declined, and the Philippine team launched a large-scale attack, repeatedly taking advantage of our weaknesses to score points. The scoreboard showed a score of nineteen to fifteen, with the Philippine army winning by a large margin. Our army then reorganized its ranks and worked hard to achieve the final victory. Although our shouts were hoarse, we could only block their two attacks. When it came to Qiu Guangxie's turn, we had a small victory, but in the end, we could not avoid being greatly suppressed by the Philippine team. The score was twenty-one to seventeen, with the Philippine team winning, and the game ended.</p>
<h3>(III) General Evaluation of Ball Skills</h3>
<p>In this game, the Philippine team's long general repeatedly failed in his attempts to split the ball, so at the beginning, he was unable to make progress, so he changed his tactics and also used left and right outflanking, scoring ten points in a row. After that, he used a variety of net follow-through and net split shots, and finally won the victory. The Philippine team's ball saving was far better than our team's, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Our team knew the strengths and weaknesses of the Philippine team's long general, so we specially used Xu Heng to guard the net to monitor him. Xu is also a tall and long-armed warrior. We also used Wu Yongqin as the second route to save the ball. Xu was quite cunning and quite effective in monitoring the eldest son, but Wu's splitting skills were far inferior to Qiu's, which was not worth the loss. Later, when Qiu was replaced, he repeatedly made outstanding achievements, which is clear evidence. The attacks on both routes were only slightly implemented. Chen Xibing's splitting position was the same as Cao Tingzan's, so the right side was not as successful as the left side, because the enemy could monitor both Chen and Cao with one person, and the two often had the disadvantage of competing with each other, which may be the reason why Cao Tingzan could not unleash his flying kick. Our team's three routes were the weakest point of the whole team, which can be said to have had more than enough offense and not enough defense, which was the reason for our failure.</p>

<h3>First China-Japan Women's Volleyball Match</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army's Practical Strength is Strong (Qian Hua)</p>
<p>Our Athletes' Individual Skills Are Not Weak</p>
<p>Two to Zero... Japan Wins Over China</p>
<p>(Tokyo Telegraph) On the second day of the Far Eastern Games (25th), the China-Japan women's volleyball demonstration was held at 1:00 PM. Our athletes still had the remaining power from yesterday's victory over the Philippines, so the Japanese army treated them with extreme caution. First, Ms. Seto Chieko of the Japanese team served. Because our army was on the west side, the Japanese army used the sunlight of early summer to repeatedly serve high-angle balls, causing our army to aim inaccurately and unable to display its skills. When Japan scored eleven points, the sides were switched, and the Japanese army continued to serve. Our army was indeed in a better position with the sun behind them. Seto's ball was snatched back by our athlete Ms. Xiao Huiling, and Ms. Deng Zhihao served. However, because our army's setbacks in the first half were too great, their morale was already low, and it was difficult to succeed. The first set was completely lost.</p>
<p>In the second set, the Japanese army still served first. When the Japanese army scored thirteen points, Ms. Xiao Huiling served and scored three points in a row, which was a major turning point. The cheering squad also cheered loudly. After all, Japan's strength was strong, steady, and敏鋭, and both were appropriate. Although our army scored another point after that, the overall situation was gone and the morale was low. As a result, the Japanese army won with a score of twenty-one to four. However, in terms of individual skills, our army actually has many outstanding members. If they can practice diligently from now on, it may not be difficult to win in the future.</p>

<h3>First China-Philippines Basketball Battle</h3>
<p>The Philippines Wins Over China 39 to 34</p>
<p>China's Failure to Japan and the Philippines Has Been Disappointing</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM on the 25th, the first China-Philippines basketball match took place. Unexpectedly, our team lost to the Philippines again with a score of 34 to 39. After two expeditions, they lost to Japan once and to the Philippines twice. Therefore, there is little hope for the basketball championship. People at home believed that this basketball team was confident, but they did not expect them to be so unprepared for battle. As a result, the reputation of the Nankai Five Tigers has been completely swept away. In terms of strength, the Philippine army was indeed stronger than us. Their cooperation and accuracy in throwing the ball were excellent. Our team was able to support them in the first half, but made many mistakes in the second half. There were many opportunities to throw the ball under the basket, but none of them hit. Liu Jianchang and Tang Baokun desperately shot from a distance, but none of them hit. Fortunately, the Philippine side was penalized a lot, otherwise the record would definitely not be so close. However, Wang Xiliang of our team did not play that night, and was replaced by Lu Zhongen. Lu Hengxi showed off his personal style and desperately dribbled the ball forward, missing good opportunities. The details of the battle are as follows:</p>
<p>A Tie in the Score In the second minute of the start of the war, Filipino Luo Mino scored a goal from the left, opening the record. Liu Jianchang of our team also scored a goal in return. Before long, Filipino right guard Gros远 attacked a ball and made it two to four, with the Philippine team taking the lead. After that, the two sides chased each other, but the Philippine team always had more points. In the last moment of the first half, Liu Jianchang threw the ball under the basket and scored two points. As a result, the first half ended with a score of 19 to 19, with a tie in the score. At that time, Filipino No. 3 strongman Luo Mino was injured and left the field, which also had a considerable impact.</p>
<p>Missed Opportunities After the lemon time, Filipino strongman Luo Mino returned to the field. Our team worked hard to attack. Liu Jianchang opened the record and scored a goal. Lu Zhongen followed and also scored a goal. As a result, the score became 23 to 19, and our team gained the upper hand. After that, the two sides fought each other even more fiercely. The cheering squads of both sides fought hard, and the war became more and more fierce. The air in the field was extremely tense, fast and敏捷, and the clarity of the transmission between the two sides was better than</p>
<h3>Japanese Swimmers' Leaping Water Expressions</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War, which is far superior to China, is by no means a fluke. The final record was 30 to 26 when our country won, there were still eight minutes left. Unexpectedly, Lu Zhong and Li Guo were penalized twice in a row, and the balls thrown by the Philippine side were also counted, with a difference of eight points before and after. The overall situation was gone and could not be saved. Lu Li missed the opportunity, alas. Soon Li Guochen was penalized four times and left the field, replaced by Liu Guanjun, but it was to no avail. The total score was 39 to 34, with the Philippines winning. The second half was 20 to 15, with the Philippines winning.</p>

<h3>Chinese Baseball Team Wins Over the Philippines in the Preliminary Round</h3>
<p>A Score of Nine to Six</p>
<p>Strategic Attacks on the Enemy Create the Cause of Victory</p>
<p>Many Mistakes Spoil the Perfection</p>
<p>(Tokyo Telegraph) The preliminary baseball game between China and the Philippines was held at the Meiji Jingu Baseball Stadium at 2:30 PM on the 24th. The opening ball was thrown by Mr. Kishiseichi, Chairman of the Far Eastern Games. The umpire was Tenchi and the base umpires were Yokosawa, Qiancun, and Nitta. The Philippine army attacked first. The following is a brief record of the game:</p>
<p>Because pitcher Cheng Guanbing of the Chinese team was good at throwing the ball quickly and powerfully, and had many variations, the Philippine army collapsed from the first inning to the fourth inning and gained nothing. On the contrary, our team was smooth sailing. In the first inning, Zhang Rongan stepped onto the field and hit the ball, which flew far to the left wing. The enemy could not catch up, so he took the opportunity to occupy second base. Then, he cleverly used a strategic plan and scored one point first. He then launched a strong attack at the right time and scored another point. The Philippine team immediately changed pitchers, but our army had already taken the lead. In the third inning, after one out on our team, three strong players rose up and scored consecutive hits, creating an excellent opportunity for bases loaded. Strong hitter He Donghan was unfortunately hit in the foot by a dead ball, so he gained a point without labor. The situation was still very favorable, but it was a pity that the follow-up was weak and could not increase more points. In the fifth inning, our army's outfield defense occasionally neglected, causing one point to be sent to the Philippines. In the sixth inning, the Philippines took advantage of the momentum to launch a sharp attack and scored another point. However, our team did not give in at all. They used the enemy's mistakes to advance to the base and used a strategic plan, which was successful. They added two points in a row, and the battle situation was quite optimistic. Unexpectedly, in the seventh inning, they fell into a difficult situation. Although two people on the Philippine army advanced to the base, there were already two outs. They thought that there would be no surprises, but the shortstop was anxious to block the enemy and made a wild throw, wasting one point. After that, the Philippines scored a double and increased two points, creating a tie, which was very urgent. Fortunately, our army had a strong counterattack and the enemy made another mistake. We regained four points and the situation finally stabilized. In the eighth inning, Zhong You was appointed as the pitcher. Although the Philippine army had a good opportunity to load the bases, Zhong You calmly killed the enemy one after another. In the ninth inning, the Philippines fought hard at the end and scored one point, but it was too late. As a result, our team finally won by a score of nine to six.</p>

<h3>(I) Men's Japan-Philippines Championship</h3>
<p>(Tokyo 2nd Dispatch) The main battle of the second day of the Far Eastern Tennis Tournament was the doubles match between Yamagishi and Shimura of Japan against Aragon and Yngayo of the Philippines. As a result, Japan won with scores of six to one, six to four, and six to three. In the five-game confrontation between Japan and the Philippines, China has won three games in the past two days, that is, it has won the right to compete in the final with our country, the holder of the 8th Championship.</p>
<p>The competition started at 1:20 PM on the 25th. Mr. Anagi served first and lost a set completely. Although Shimura of the team lost the serve repeatedly in the second set, Japan still won and made the situation two to zero. The Philippine team only won the third set in the first game. The victory was entirely due to Yakoyue's ability to press the ball. After that, he lost another set completely and finally lost six to one.</p>
<p>In the second game, the two teams fought fiercely. Anagen performed very well. On the Japanese side, Shimura's repeated failures caused the high ball to be almost unsustainable. After the start, Japan and the Philippines each won a set. In the third set, Anagen had two excellent shots, which made the Japanese team at a loss. After that, they won and lost alternately and attacked each other until they were in a hurry and fierce. Finally, the Japanese team won four sets in a row and the second game ended with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the third game, Shimura's serve was inaccurate and he repeatedly failed to hit the net. The Philippine team took the lead with two to zero. Unfortunately, Yakoyue had repeated inaccurate and fierce shots, resulting in five consecutive losses and turning into a five to two situation for Japan. Then, the Philippines and Japan each scored a set and a fierce battle ended.</p>
<p>In this battle, in terms of personal skills, the Philippine team repeatedly surpassed the Japanese players. In particular, Anagen's lob, side shots, and wheeled attacks were effective. However, they still could not avoid a disastrous defeat, which was due to the lack of contact and cooperation. On the other hand, for the Japanese team, it was difficult to have a possibility of winning against the Philippine team in terms of personal skills. Shimura's repeated failures in serving and high balls have been enough to put Japan in a position of hundreds of incomes. Even if Yamagishi performed better, it was not as good as Anagen. The one who finally won the final victory was the length of the cooperation.</p>
<h3>Water Polo Performance</h3>
<h3>(II) Women's China-Philippines Demonstration Match</h3>
<p>The women's doubles match between China and the Philippines was suspended due to rain. The women's doubles match between China and the Philippines was fierce. The Li sisters performed very well. Mudan's emergency shots and Xinghua's ball saves were particularly skillful. On the Philippine side, Jaliya was better and Ms. Yakoyue's net ball was also very bad. In the two teams, our country's cooperation skills were slightly better.</p>
<p>Philippine Yakoyue served first and won a set. In the second set, Li Xinghua also won with a serve. Although we lost completely in the third set, we won four or five sets in a row. After the sixth set, the score was three to three. Relying on Ms. Xinghua's safe play, we created a situation in which we won two sets. The first game of the five to three match was none other than ours. Unexpectedly, Jia was in such an unfavorable situation, and when he encountered it, he made a desperate effort and won two sets in a row. In this equally matched and fierce battle, the beautiful God who did not help suddenly poured down heavy rain, so that the four women had to temporarily collect their flags, put down their drums, and wait for tomorrow to decide the victory with a score of five to five.</p>

<h3>Director Chen of the Municipal Education Bureau</h3>
<h3>Talks About Holding the High School Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau will hold a high school entrance examination for graduates of junior high schools and primary schools in the city at the end of this semester. The measures have been promulgated. Unexpectedly, there have been unfounded rumors in various schools recently, saying that the Education Bureau will use the results of this high school entrance examination as a basis for taking over or banning them. This is not the case. The reporter went to visit Chen Dezheng, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, yesterday specifically for this matter. According to Chen, the purpose of this high school entrance examination is to investigate the level of graduates of various schools so as to guide and improve them. Because the levels of various schools are often uneven, graduates experience many difficulties in entering higher education, and the effectiveness of education is inevitably reduced. The reason why this bureau advocates for the high school entrance examination is to improve the level of graduates of various schools as a preparatory work, and to make the levels of schools of the same grade completely equal. As for the rumors spread outside, I had hoped for them earlier. In fact, it is not worth a smile from the discerning person. This bureau has never prepared to take over any middle school, and it will never use this high school entrance examination to evaluate the merits and demerits of each school, and to make absolute rewards and punishments. This rumor must be a reactionary element's conspiracy to disrupt, so it spreads unfounded remarks in various schools, which is absurd. This bureau has repeatedly received reports that the Attached Middle School of Fudan University in Xujiahui first launched it. Now, in order to investigate the inside story of the facts, the truth has been sent to the investigator. If this rumor is indeed spread by the school, then for the sake of the discipline of the entire education community, it must be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Citywide Elementary School Regular Entrance Examination</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has designated trial sites to hold a high school entrance examination for graduates of municipal and registered private elementary schools this year and sent staff to preside over the examination. It has now designated 21 examination sites, scheduled for three days from June 20 to 22, from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM every day. If any school fails to comply with the order, its graduation certificate will not be printed, and all middle schools will be notified that they will not be allowed to apply for admission in the next semester to show restrictions.</p>
<h3>Junior High Schools Must Not Use Foreign Language Textbooks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to middle schools in this city, saying that in order to comply with the order, it was found that some junior high school textbooks used foreign language originals. Junior high school students have a lower level of foreign languages, which will inevitably lead to difficulties in interpretation for teachers and difficulties in understanding for students, and all subjects cannot progress evenly. All junior high school textbooks in junior high schools, except for foreign languages, must not explore the use of foreign language textbooks to facilitate teaching. For this reason, the middle schools in this city must abide by this order.</p>
<p>Director of Anhui Education Department</p>
<h3>Cheng Tianfang Hosts News Reporters</h3>
<p>Cheng Tianfang, member of the Anhui Provincial Government and Director of the Education Department, came to Shanghai from Anqing a few days ago and has been written in various newspapers. The night before last, Mr. Cheng specially invited education news reporters from major newspapers in Shanghai to a banquet at the Great Eastern Hotel. During the banquet, Mr. Cheng spoke and first stated that educational administrative organs and those responsible for educational remarks should work together to seek the development of China's educational cause. During the banquet, he said that it has been a year since I arrived in Anhui, and it has been four months in this period. Although I have weak personal ability and cannot say that I have achieved much, I have been diligently engaged in rectifying the style of study and expanding various educational undertakings and have not dared to slacken. In the 18th year, the number of secondary schools was increased, and the equipment and construction of the original schools were also strived to be complete. The educational funding was increased by more than 300,000 yuan. Anhui students have always liked to make trouble, but in the past year they have gradually gotten on track. In this semester, no provincial secondary school has had any problems. An Da has recently been unfortunate and eventful. Since Principal Wang Xinggong took office, he has been stationed in Hankou all the time. The total time he has been in school is only more than a month. The opinions of important internal personnel have not been consistent, which has led to conflicts with each other and the deans and professors have left the school one after another. The studies of 400 young people have been greatly sacrificed, which is very regrettable. The truth of the An Da turmoil is that some people outside have said that I advocated using Yang to overthrow Wang, which caused Wang not to come to school, and that I left Anhui in anger because my proposal to the provincial government to use Yang to succeed Wang was not approved. This is very strange. President Wang has repeatedly telegraphed his resignation because he cannot get rid of Wuhan University. At that time, I was acting as the chairman. If I had the intention to use Yang to overthrow Wang, I would have approved it immediately. Not only did I not approve his resignation, but I also sent two telegrams to urge him to return to school and take responsibility for those who issued leaflets attacking Wang. The Public Security Bureau was ordered to strictly handle it. This has been disclosed by newspapers in Anhui and Shanghai. As for Yang's resignation due to disagreement, I did not know it beforehand. If I wanted to use Yang, why would I let him leave Anhui? My coming to Shanghai is purely because I acted as the chairman for two months. My heart is exhausted. An Da is fine. This matter is that villains deliberately spread rumors to destroy my reputation, because the scum of the Anhui education community has been expelled by me and does not hesitate to use this sinister means to seek personal gain. Recently, some newspapers have occasionally published news attacking Anhui education, which are all from their hands. Reporters from various newspapers are too far away from Anhui and do not know the truth very well. It is inevitable that they will sometimes make mistakes and post it. In the future, please pay special attention to the manuscripts to avoid villains from succeeding. Mr. Cheng also presented the reporters with a thick volume of "Anhui Education in the Past Year", which is rich in content and beautifully printed. It is rare in China. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until 9:00 PM before leaving.</p>
<h3>The Third Anniversary of Guanghua Day 2</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the fifth anniversary of Guanghua. At 9:30 AM, a flag-raising ceremony was held. More than 1,000 guests, faculty, staff, and students participated.

<h3>Japanese Gymnastics School Performance</h3>
<p>Previously, (1) Guanghua University has a glorious history, and everyone must understand that in recent years, the movement to reclaim educational rights has surged, and Guanghua is a pioneer in its implementation. Guanghua is not the Guanghua of an individual, nor is it the Guanghua of Mr. Wang Sheng-san, nor is it the Guanghua of Principal Zhang, it is the Guanghua of our people, the Guanghua of our Chinese nation. Everyone understands the history of Guanghua, and in the future, you must work hard, continue the spirit of the Sixth Third, cooperate with each other, and sacrifice together to achieve the glorious goal. (2) Everyone must be optimistic. The past history of our Guanghua, in just two months, was able to establish a school site, and the school building will be completed within a year. The future is limitless.</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, a commemorative ceremony was held in the auditorium, with the following agenda: Salute, Chairman Zhang Shouyong delivered the opening remarks, followed by speeches by Wang Sheng-san as representative, Dr. Wang Rutang, Minister of Foreign Affairs as representative, representatives of the Special City Education Bureau, and class representatives. Finally, the opening ceremony of the Wang Sheng-san Memorial Pavilion, a speech by a alumni representative, cheers, and dismissal.</p>
<p>At 1:00 PM, an alumni meeting was held, attended by more than eighty alumni. Chairman Zhang Zupei resolved (1) to establish an office in the school for contact.

Many people attended to watch. Principal Zhang Shouyong personally inspected the troops, first demonstrating gymnastics, formation changes, and marching in order. The audience applauded. Then, awards were given to more than twenty winners. After Principal Zhang gave a speech, he visited the campsite, which had twenty-five tents arranged in a line, neatly arranged and orderly. Next, semaphore, observation, and fire fighting were demonstrated with excellent results. The performance ended at around 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Dismissing it with a Laugh, Seafarer</h3>
<p>A: Your son is young and weak. How can you let him join the army?</p>
<p>B: It doesn't matter, I'll tell him to join the cavalry. He'll be riding a horse all day long and won't have to walk himself. How pleasant.</p>
<p>Tenant: There are very big rats in the small room you rented to me.</p>
<p>Second Landlord: You only gave me ten dollars a month. Did you expect me to get you some snow-white little foreign mice to play with?</p>
<p>Master: That express letter is very important. Have you mailed it yet?</p>
<p>Stupid Servant: I've already mailed it.</p>
<p>Master: But why did you bring back the money for the postage stamp?</p>
<p>Stupid Servant: I saw that no one was around, so I quietly dropped it in the mailbox, saving that money.</p>
<p>A: Tonight, I want to bring my wife with me to visit you at your residence.</p>
<p>B: Welcome, welcome. But please don't let your wife wear that newly made fur coat. I'm afraid my wife will be envious when she sees it.</p>
<p>A: But the reason we're coming to your residence is to show you this fur coat.</p>
<h3>A Student Returning from America Talks About Lu Chubao</h3>
<p>A certain gentleman returned from studying in the United States and recounted his feelings, many of which had not been mentioned by others. I hereby record them for the information of those who are concerned about world affairs. Since I have not obtained general consent, I will omit his surname for now. The following is what the gentleman said.</p>
<p>On my way back to China, I detoured through Europe and traveled around various countries. It lasted for three and a half months. I was traveling in a hurry, so I didn't have time to go into detail, but the sights passed before my eyes left me with some impressions.</p>
<p>Returning students always lavish praise on the country where they studied, extolling its prosperity and grandeur, as if wishing China to be like that as soon as possible. In fact, this is a great mistake. I stayed in the United States for three years and observed everything. I could only be amazed and tongue-tied. Not only can China not learn from the United States, but even the countries of Europe cannot catch up.</p>
<p>The United States is the richest country in the world, so its civilization is bought with money. Starting a business or building a factory requires billions of dollars at hand. Everywhere shows the color of wealth. There is transportation in the air and transportation underground. One layer is not enough, so there are two layers. It is with the feeling that "the master has a lot of money and is not afraid of anything being out of reach." Therefore, the countries of Europe still look up to it with trepidation, let alone China, which is in the midst of national chaos and poverty.</p>
<p>There are many historical sites in Europe. America, with its shallow history, naturally has no so-called ancient sites. In the British Museum, there is a diamond that is about three inches in diameter, like a large steamed bun. It is so dazzling that one cannot look directly at it.</p>
<p>During the four years of the European War, Germany did not suffer any major losses. It was nothing more than practicing on the borders of neighboring countries. When it realized that the enemy was at the gates and disaster was imminent, it negotiated a treaty. After the war, the reparations were huge. Knowing that it could not afford to repay them, it carefully manufactured goods for the world to use, using products as money to repay the huge debt. Therefore, countries such as England, France, and the United States knew that Germany had these products and often stopped making them themselves. They said, "The Germans have already prepared them for us, so there is no need to work."</p>
<h3>Recording the "Earth Snake" of Putuo Island, Yi Meizi</h3>
<p>Putuo is isolated in the sea. The foothills are overgrown with grass and trees, where snakes inhabit. However, the monks on the mountain uphold the Buddhist precepts and prohibit killing. People do not harm snakes, and snakes live in peace and do not wantonly release poison. When snakes lay eggs, they are occasionally swept into the pools among the jagged rocks by the wind and waves. In the sea, there are salamanders, also known as mountain peppers, which are the largest of the amphibians. Their bodies are slightly warm and are warm-blooded animals. The salamanders swim attached to the rocks, touching the snake eggs repeatedly. After several times, small fish break out of the eggs. They are commonly called "earth snakes." The actors of the Shanghai Film Company recently went to Putuo to film "Beauty Island." They caught one on Jinsha Beach. The monks repeatedly told them not to cook and eat it, saying that the fish was very poisonous and could cause the stomach and intestines to rupture if eaten. They also recounted the origin of the fish. The actors packed it in an alcohol bottle and brought it back with them. I saw it. It was only two or three inches long, with a cylindrical body, a white belly, and a dark gray back with spots. The tail was extremely small, the eyes were slightly cloudy, and there were no scales, only sharp spines, from which a sticky juice came out, which was the venom. It is said that this fish is not always there. Snake eggs are often broken and incomplete when swept into the waves. Even if the eggs are complete, they cannot be born without the attachment of a salamander's body. Otherwise, toxins would fill the air, and even other fish of the same kind would not be spared.</p>
<p>After the war, the Allied powers strictly restricted Germany to prevent it from rising again. However, the Germans have a strong will and are constantly striving for progress even when there is nothing they can do. Therefore, countries such as England and France can only look at it with apprehension.</p>
<p>It is strange that I obtained this from personal observation. No matter what kind of business, no matter what kind of national politics, the word "behind-the-scenes" cannot be avoided. In the United States, a certain company was building a tunnel. There were many bidders. One company's bid exceeded one million, but it was selected. It was said that it had bribed the engineer with three million gold. Later, the matter was exposed, and the whole country knew about it.</p>
<p>There are several small countries in Europe whose poverty is no less than that of our country. However, the level of education among the people in these countries is universal, so they do not perish.</p>
<p>If China wants to be strong and prosperous today, it can only learn from Europe. Among European countries, Germany is a good model. Drawing a tiger but failing to resemble it will only result in a dog. If we fail to learn from the United States, it will be unspeakable. The Zhongshan Avenue in the capital is an example of learning from the United States' mistakes. When Europeans build roads, they initially use gravel and gradually add asphalt on both sides, thus gradually improving them, not all at once. However, once Road A is completed, Road B is also built, striving for universality. There is no strange phenomenon of being too far apart. Zhongshan Road was so magnificent at first, but construction is easy, and road maintenance is difficult. After a long time of disrepair, it has become irreparable. Moreover, apart from Zhongshan Road, the capital has not yet seen any good roads. If this continues, only those that are completed will have no money to repair, and those that are not completed will have no money to build.</p>
<h3>Records of What I Saw and Heard on My Return Journey, Tan Lizhang</h3>
<p>I have been a guest in Shanghai for several years, and I make plans to return home once a year. Last year, I was ill for more than ten days and was absent from my job for a long time, so I gave up my return home for another year. My kind mother eagerly awaits me, and my young son longs for the white clouds. The time is in early summer, and the vegetation is flourishing. Listening to the cuckoo's voice, I feel like going home. I suddenly have a craving for water shield and perch. In the middle of the month, I packed my bags and set off. I will now write down what I saw and heard on my journey home to record the traces of my life.</p>
<p>After being a guest in the noisy Shanghai for a long time, I hear the clatter of cars all day long. The noise is indescribable. The car left the North Station, and I looked out the window into the distance. A gentle breeze brushed my face, and the green grass was like a carpet. Farmers worked in the fields, singing their natural songs to relieve their fatigue. Occasionally, there were one or two shepherd boys riding horizontally on the backs of cows, embellishing the scene. It was nothing less than a natural painting. At that time, I felt open-minded and refreshed. The vulgar dust was completely washed away. The people in the car and the people outside the car each enjoyed their own happiness. I really don't know if there are still compatriots on the front lines whose are engulfed by flames of war and who are moaning and groaning, unable to find life.</p>
<p>The car arrived in Liangxi, and it was already evening. I checked my luggage and walked out of the station. Liangxi was a place I had visited before. After finding the New World Hotel, I walked around the road alone, feeling bored. Later, I heard that my old friend Zhou Jun was also staying at this hotel. I missed him by a hair's breadth, which made me quite regretful. The next day, I bought a ticket and boarded a boat. Fortunately, I met my fellow villager Yang Jun, and we chatted endlessly to pass the long day. The boat arrived at Xifan, just a stone's throw from my hometown. My humble home was in sight, and joy filled my face. Xifan is a large lake in Yixing, covering dozens of miles. It is vast and boundless. In addition, there were continuous spring rains, and the river water overflowed. It was nearly dusk, and the setting sun hung obliquely on the treetops. I stood at the bow of the boat and looked into the distance. The mist was closing in on all sides, and the evening clouds were gray. Gulls were floating, and sails were rising and falling. I lingered in the middle of the stream. The days were not the same as before, and the scenery was as beautiful as ever. I was struck by the feeling that the sun and moon urge people on, and time waits for no one. Suddenly, the gate of my village came into view. After being away from home for a long time, I suddenly felt uneasy in my heart. Only those who have experienced it can know the feeling. My home is in the western outskirts of Yixing. After being away from home for two years, the situation was completely different. It was desolate and declining, and filled with sorrow. My close friends Dai Jiagu and Li Yingzhou came to visit. According to them, last year, locusts swept through the area, and most of the crops were trampled. In addition, drought caused havoc, and the autumn harvest was hopeless. The weak naturally fell into the ditches, while the strong took risks. With the encouragement of secret societies, one person raised a banner, and the people followed. The disturbances lasted for several months before they were pacified. However, even now, bandits are not at peace. The area has been damaged again and again, and the people's livelihood is declining, beyond description. The price of rice has risen to 16.5 yuan. As a result, the rich become poor, and the poor cannot even afford food. Not long ago, a certain wood shop, a family of eight, earned their living by chopping wood. This year, the four villages are struggling to find food and have no surplus funds to replace farm implements. The impact of this is that there is no surplus grain in the house, and the stove is without smoke. They barely fill their hunger with red clover grass every day. If they reach a time when they have no food at all, what will they do? Local elders Yang Meisheng and business tycoons Li Muzhi and Dai Peiyin have launched a plan to stabilize prices, but it is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. It is said that Rong Jun, a gentleman in Wuxi, is saddened by the widespread suffering and believes that the poor receive very little help. He plans to prepare grain for disaster relief and has entrusted a Mr. Xu to investigate the household registration of disaster victims in the village. However, after a brief inspection, it was found that as many as more than 30,000 households were without food. In the end, he could not help them and temporarily stopped the plan. However, those who are suffering are still stretching their necks and waiting.</p>
<h3>Returning from the Jade Buddha Temple, Ma Xiechong</h3>
<p>The first day of the month was the 90th death anniversary of the mother of Mr. Liu Zhitin, director of the Yarn Market Exchange. A service was held at the Jade Buddha Temple on Gordon Road. Before 10:00 AM, I went with Mr. Zhao Nanhuang and others to pay our respects. The monks' quarters in the temple were secluded and spacious, and the decorations were quite elegant. Under the steps, the pines and cypresses were lush and green, and the flowers and plants were colorful. The refreshing fragrance was intoxicating. Entering the Great Buddha Hall, the statues of the Buddha and the Arhats were dazzling with golden light and stood majestically. Turning into the back hall, the furnishings were exquisite. The four walls were adorned with couplets and poems by famous people, as well as several ancient paintings with vigorous brushstrokes, which were especially rare and made people marvel. Then, I went upstairs from the right side and saw a jade Buddha statue with hanging tassels, sitting majestically in a red cabinet. It is said that it was genuine jade mined from Burma, worth more than 30,000 gold. However, the old saying goes, "White jade is flawless." Seeing its black spots, it is probably not pure jade. I am ashamed of lacking Bian He's talent and did not dare to make rash judgments. The temple's Buddha hall is majestic, and the architecture is magnificent, but unfortunately, there is no natural scenery for people to linger in. It seems to be inferior to the Jinshan Temple in my hometown, which is surrounded by mountains and water and has natural scenery. Our group of seven people toured the entire temple. Three of them joined in a game of mahjong. As I sat bored, I felt something. The reason for our country's poverty and weakness is that there are few producers and many consumers. In addition, years of war and natural disasters have devastated the country's agriculture, and the people are not living well. However, the monks and nuns, who are only good at consuming and cannot produce, are well-fed and warmly clothed and live comfortably. Although the former government had orders to overthrow superstition and abolish monks and nuns, they have not been thoroughly implemented to this day. As a result, our bald compatriots on barren hills are still carefree and enjoying their leisurely blessings. Just in the case of the Jade Buddha Temple alone, the construction costs and temple properties are estimated to be worth more than 200,000 gold. If it were used to build factories and force the original monks to change their careers to manual labor, it would give some unemployed people in society the opportunity to work, which may not be a bad plan.</p>

<h3>Cheng Yanqiu's Newly Arranged Complete Version of Liu Yingchun</h3>
<p>In recent years, the Beijing opera world has been competing to stage new operas to meet the trends. There are many newly written ones, but few that recount the past. Cheng Lang Yanqiu, aware of this, specially commissioned the playwright Qingyi Jushi to write the complete version of Liu Yingchun. Because Yanqiu's performance of "Fenhe Bay" has always been well-received by customers, they all regret not seeing the whole picture. Now, the beginning and end have been added, and the plot is unusually tortuous, like a seamless garment, with the beginning and the end clearly understood. This play starts with Liu Yuanwai looking for good materials for the construction project and ends with the reunion of husband and wife in Fenhe Bay. The whole play has a total of more than twenty scenes. Among them, scenes such as "Giving Clothes and Saying Goodbye to Mother" and "Sending Husband at the Temple Fair" are delicate in sentiment and writing, with mournful and melancholic emotions. The singing is heavy, which is especially wonderful. This play focuses purely on the story of Liu Yingchun, and Xue Rengui is not mentioned in detail. Therefore, it is named "Liu Yingchun." Yanqiu has already performed this play at the Huale Garden in Beijing, with Jiang Miaoxiang playing Xue Li in the first part, Wang Shaolou playing Xue Li in the second part, Li Hongchun playing Liu Yuanwai, and Li Duokui playing Liu Anren, and Wu Fuqin playing Tian Shi. It is a perfect combination and can be called a masterpiece. It will undoubtedly be as highly praised as "The Golden Lock Record" and "The Red Mark Record."</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (Two) (Five), Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Beautiful Woman Returns to Her Native Land, Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family</p>
<p>Liu Xingshu said, "So, is it already settled now?" Zuo Shichen said, "When Ruiyun told me, I heard that it wasn't settled yet. It was like it was being auctioned in an auction house, and the gavel hasn't been struck yet. I haven't seen her for several days now. I guess it's already settled by now." Liu Xingshu said, "According to you, which of the three is the best?" Zuo Shichen laughed and said, "Your question is strange. What does it have to do with me if the girls in their brothel get married? You can't ask an outsider to choose a husband for them, can you?" Liu Xingshu said, "It's not like that. We're just discussing it in private." Zuo Shichen said, "I don't know much about these three men who want to marry Ruiyun. I can't tell who is better. However, our views are slightly different from those of the girls in the brothel. According to me, there are three conditions for the girls in the brothel to get married. First, of course, is the person. He must be gentle and refined. Someone who is violent always feels wrong. And we also have a fixed idea that we are scholars and hope that they will also marry a scholar. Marrying a scholar is considered a good thing. In addition, he should be a legitimate businessman. We don't want them to marry a con man or a gambler. In fact, maybe they would be much more comfortable and happier marrying a con man or a gambler than marrying a scholar. But we always have that kind of foolish idea. The second condition is the issue of property. The girls in the brothel are of course marrying to be someone's concubine. Although they are being played with, they are also trying to be comfortable. And if they give birth to a son or daughter, they will get some of the family property for their later years. Because people in brothels are not used to working. The third is a personal issue, which is how fierce their first wife is. If the master gets them without the consent of his wife, no matter how beautiful or ugly they are, they will be envied and there will always be a quarrel. And this is a bone-attaching disease that will continue to quarrel forever. Today, they quarrel. Tomorrow, they quarrel. How can you survive? So, in our view, when we are older, we don't care about this. As long as they meet these three conditions, that's enough. However, for the girls in the brothel, the most important thing when they get married is age. There are two old sayings: 'Girls love handsome men, and madams love money.' Although it's an old cliché, it's also a timeless truth. Now, some people criticize the girls in the brothel for liking young and handsome men. But isn't it right to like young and handsome men? People are the same. If they don't like young and handsome men, do you want them to like old and ugly men? Why do men like girls who are sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, or nineteen years old, and not old women? You like young and beautiful women yourself, but if women like young and handsome men, you gossip. Think about it yourself, and you'll laugh to yourself. As for being greedy for young and handsome men and therefore being fooled by them, that also happens. That's their own problem and should be discussed separately."</p>

<h3>Major Changes in the Gold Market</h3>
<p>Crazy Jump of Seven Taels and One Qian</p>
<p>High Point of Sixty-Nine Taels and Three Qian</p>
<p>A shocking price surge. Yesterday, the Gold Exchange opened as usual, and the gold price soared and reached a new high. It rose sharply, more than two taels, almost breaking through 570 taels, which is truly the highest peak ever seen in history. However, there were fluctuations. The morning market had a difference of more than 12 taels. Its pace was very good, and people's hearts were extremely high. The afternoon market also had a twist of 10 taels. Foreign exchange rates, both official and black market, were expensive, and the posted price had shrunk by three notches. Banks had strong buying intentions, and supply was erratic among dealers. Generally, there were more buyers, and Zifengyong, Yuda, Taixing, and Yongchang were all vying to buy. Chengfengyong, Xiangyu, and retail investors had all sold. Since large bars in the morning market repeatedly declined, they opened high. Afterwards, they rose sharply, rising more than ten taels in total. In the afternoon market, Xiangyu and Yongchang and others entered, while Shunli, Zifengyong, Tianyu Yong, etc., sold off. Foreign exchange rates became increasingly tight, so they broke out of the 60-tael barrier, but there were still three or four taels of trading. Finally, it reached a new high of more than 569 taels, and a major storm is inevitable in the future.</p>
<p>Open jump of seven taels. Yesterday, the British silver market shrunk by a quarter, and the silver price shrunk by seven-eighths. The opening price for July was 548 taels and 8 qian, up by seven taels. The gross margin rose from 47 taels and 5 qian to 52 taels, but Wanxing and retail investors chased it up. Not long after, it went back two taels and changed at around 50 taels. The spot price was reduced by 75 US cents to 1 yuan and 5, and the Japanese gold price increased by a huge 4.875, but the gold price was 51 taels and 67 qian, so someone sold it. Then it went to 50 taels and 9 qian. Later, the domestic bill price rose, and people's hearts became firmer, rising by four taels. Tong Taichang and others bought it in at 10 o'clock and it was 55 taels, then it retreated by two taels and a bit. In an instant, it soared to the sky, rising by more than seven taels. However, there were two or three taels of trading. At 10:30, it reached 60 taels. The recent British gold price only closed at 6 pence and 375. The Japanese gold price increased to 1 tael and 3 qian and 2 fen. At noon, it was trimmed by two taels, then added another tael or so. The market closed at 59 taels and 4 qian at noon.</p>
<p>Closing price of sixty-eight taels and nine qian. The afternoon market opened at 59 taels and 1 qian. Then, buyers were very encouraged and rose sharply by more than six taels to 65 and a half taels. Suddenly, large investors sold off and fell sharply by four taels and two points to 61 taels. Afterwards, it rose and fell by two or three taels. After three o'clock, it had a tendency to advance a thousand miles a day. The bill market was extremely tight. The advance order for August made 6 pence and 4375, and the wheat firm bought 5625 for September, so it rose sharply by more than seven taels. After four o'clock, it reached 69 taels and 3 qian. At 4:30, the closing price was 568 taels and 9 qian, compared with May 31 (last Saturday), up by more than 27 taels and 1 qian.</p>
<p>The posted price is reduced by fifty or sixty taels. The maximum price during the day was 569 taels and 3 qian, and the minimum price was 547 taels and a half, a difference of 21 taels and 8 qian. The posted price has been changed to more than 616 taels and 2 qian, with a reduction of more than 60 taels. The afternoon posted price was reduced by more than 50 taels to 47 or 48 taels. The morning ledger price was 59 taels, and the afternoon ledger price was 66 taels. The exchange has held a double settlement price, with a water supplement of 59 taels in the morning and 66 taels in the afternoon. The price of goods opened at 48 taels and 5 in the morning, closed at 59 taels at noon, up 9 taels and a half in the afternoon, and closed at 70 taels.</p>
<p>Dealers' supply is erratic, and trading among various firms is disordered and uncertain. Zifengyong, Yifengyong, Taixing, Yuantai, Senchangyong, Dakang, Yuda, Yuanyu Yong, Yuansheng, and Yongchang all entered. Chengfengyong, Xiangyu Yuanya Yong, Shunmao, Bingxing, and retail investors all exited. Shunli, Wanxing, Fuchang, and Hengxing were constantly coming and going. In the afternoon market, Yongchang, Yifengyong, and Xiangyu and Dadecheng all entered. Shunli, Yuanyu Yong, Tianyu Yong, Senchangyong, Yuantai, and retail investors all sold. The Dalian gang sold more than 2,000 bars and bought more than 1,000 bars in the morning market. In the afternoon market, they sold more than 1,400 bars and bought more than 1,100 or 1,200 bars, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Special Difficulty of Banks in Opening, Closing, Receiving, and Delivering Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>Small Decimal Points and Second-Tier Silver Discounts Continue</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market sentiment for silver dollars was weak again. The opening price was 7 qian 1 fen 7 li 6 hao 2 hu 5 si, the same as the closing low price from the previous day. The afternoon price was even lower by 2 hao 5 si, at 7 qian 1 fen 7 li 3 hao 7 hu 5 si. As such, new low prices appeared repeatedly. Yesterday's calculation showed a small difference. The two-tier silver discount was 2 qian 2 fen in the morning and 2 qian in the afternoon, which was 2 fen higher than the previous day. Bank postings were 9 fen with a markup of 1 qian 5 or 6 fen, eventually settling around 1 qian. Foreign currency transactions were made. The amount of transferred funds reached as high as 2,045,000 in the morning and 1,530,000 in the afternoon. Paper money transactions were 20,000 in the morning and 91,000 in the afternoon. Outside the exchange, paper money transactions were 142,000 in the morning and 160,000 in the afternoon. Foreign merchant trading outside of bank transactions amounted to 300,000 to 400,000. Chinese merchants' inter-market trading was 850,000 in the morning and 550,000 in the afternoon. Transactions between various banks and foreign accounts, receipts and deliveries, were over 1,400,000. Paper money transactions in and out were over 1,000,000. Money shops had a particularly large amount of foreign official paper receipts and deliveries, totaling over 11,100,000. Silver official paper receipts and deliveries also amounted to over 43,000,000. Foreign transfer payments were over 3,400,000, and silver transfer payments were over 4,100,000. Various remittance receipts and deliveries were over 1,800,000. Foreign currency borrowing and lending were over 3,000,000. The banks' various routine receipts and deliveries were too numerous to calculate due to the complicated procedures. It is estimated that small money shops had paper money transfer transactions of 800,000. For the auxiliary currency market, Jiangnan small silver dollars were 6 qian 2 fen 2 li in the morning and 6 qian 2 fen 3 li in the afternoon. Transactions were 1,000 jiao in the morning and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. Guangdong small silver dollars were 5 qian 9 fen 7 li 2 hao 5 si in the morning and 5 qian 9 fen 8 li 5 si in the afternoon. Transactions were 100,000 jiao in the morning and 65,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins rose again by 1,000 wen, reaching 413,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Internal Market Exceptionally Tight</h3>
<p>Listed Rates Continue to Shrink by Three Tiers</p>
<p>British Gold 1 Shilling 7 Pence 125</p>
<p>U.S. Gold 39 Yuan 875</p>
<p>Japanese Gold 1 Liang 2 Qian 7 Fen 75</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's posted foreign exchange rates continued to shrink by as much as three tiers. British gold decreased by 75, to 1 shilling 7 pence 125. U.S. gold decreased by 1 yuan 5, to 38 yuan 75. Indian currency decreased by 4 yuan 25, to 107 rupees 25. French francs decreased by 39 yuan, to 987 yuan. Dutch currency decreased by 3 yuan 75, to 96 guilders 25. Singapore exchange increased by 5 liang 5 qian, to 145 liang and a half. Hong Kong exchange increased by 1 liang and a half, to 8… 8 yuan 5. German marks increased to 162 marks. Japanese exchange rose sharply by 4 fen 875, reaching 1 liang 2 qian 7 fen 75. This was truly due to successive large decreases. The internal market exchange rates within the banks were particularly tight, with new record highs emerging constantly. However, the market was unusually chaotic. Chinese merchants were selling off. The banks had a strong appetite, and the arbitrage spread was as high as 50 to 60 liang. However, Chinese merchants did not dare to close out their positions to avoid danger. Furthermore, the current market is different from last week. Gold prices soared by more than 20 liang, reaching an unprecedented peak of 570 liang. It is estimated that British gold transactions totaled about 300,000 to 400,000 pounds. Chinese merchants sold 200,000 pounds, which were absorbed by Dutch Bank, Chase, Yokohama Specie Bank, Sumitomo, Mercantile, Shanghai Bank, etc. However, there were occasional purchases of tens of thousands, which were sold by Chase Shanghai. In addition, interbank transactions amounted to more than 100,000. U.S. dollar dealers also sold 400,000 to 500,000, which were absorbed by Mitsui, Hwa Bih, Sumitomo, and Shanghai Bank. As for Japanese exchange, Mitsui absorbed some, while Sumitomo sold slightly, only in the amount of 1,000,000, because the price was too high and difficult to handle. As a result, compared to the end of last week, the British pound sharply decreased by 1 penny 875, the U.S. dollar by 3 yuan 75, and the Japanese yen soared by 1 qian 3 fen.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Exchange Soars by 3 Liang</h3>
<p>The yarn market is soaring, and the situation is extremely intense due to the sharp depreciation of exchange rates and the soaring price of raw cotton. The yarn market is excited, and sellers are panicking. The market is erupting. The buying sentiment in the market is quite high, and people are extremely optimistic, but actual sales have not improved significantly. Only Sichuan merchants are actively purchasing. If other merchant groups follow suit, the future is limitless. As for yesterday's market situation, it was unusually chaotic and completely influenced by the gold market.</p>
<p>Buying Spree in Yarn Futures: The exchange opened with a flurry of buying. The situation was firm, and sellers were scarce due to the soaring gold market. The second and third rounds continued to rise. As a result, all months rose by 4, 8, and 9 qian. In the afternoon, it was reported that the gold price had reached a new high, and retail investors rushed in to cover their short positions. For a time, the buying clamor in the market reverberated outside. Sellers were scarce, and prices rose in every round. All months rose by 1 liang 7 qian to 2 liang 5 qian. At the close, it was reported that Guangdong merchants and manufacturers had slightly balanced their short positions. The total transaction volume for the entire day was 26,600 dan. The closing prices for the open outcry market are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Open Outcry Closing Prices, Price Increase/Decrease, Account Balance: August 16.00, Up 2.6, 25,700</p>

In addition, Guangdong merchants bought 375 bales, Tianjin merchants bought 260 bales, inland merchants bought 240 bales, Shantou merchants bought 205 bales, Xuzhou merchants bought 110 bales, and miscellaneous merchants bought 175 bales. Prices rose by more than 1 liang.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Soars With Gold</h3>
<p>Distant New Cotton Jumps More Than One Liang: Han Merchants Already Selling</p>
<p>Overseas cotton markets are falling uniformly, while the local market is experiencing a frenzied rise, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. Due to the depreciation of exchange rates and the disastrous fall in silver prices, the combined price is actually higher, so buyers are taking the opportunity to raise prices, and sellers are panicking. Therefore, the market is trending higher and higher. However, Han merchants who have made profits are still selling off in large quantities, and the momentum of bullish sentiment has not diminished slightly. However, the current market is completely influenced by the gold market. It is difficult to predict whether the frenzied rise will continue in the future.</p>
<p>Han Standard Breaks Through the 7 Liang Mark: The exchange opened with a large increase in Han standard prices due to good news, and the number of buyers in the market increased. Prices for all months rose by 1 qian and a half to 4 qian. In the afternoon, due to the discovery of new prices in the gold market, there were even more retail investors covering their short positions. All months rose by 3 qian and a half to 4, 5, and 7 qian. It was faintly heard that Han merchants had already sold off in large quantities. The total transaction volume for the entire day was 63,100 dan. The closing prices for the Han standard market are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Spot Cotton Sales Not Smooth: Sales channels are not good, but the rise in futures prices is sharp, and those holding goods have firm intentions.

<h3>World Cotton Yarn Plunges</h3>

<h3>Grain and River Rice Market Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Boatmen Did As High As 22 Yuan</p>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the supply from the interior was still scarce, and sales were active. The North Gang white japonica rice was in high demand in this street, and the prices of inland products were frequently raised. Merchants raised prices, and the market rose by another corner. However, the old japonica rice in the market failed to follow the rise. Trading throughout the day showed slight fluctuations, and the market was firm. The highest quality japonica rice was priced at 21 yuan 6-7 jiao, and it was rumored that a boatman's japonica rice had been sold for 22 yuan, but confirmation is pending. The arrival of Bo Dao rice was still scarce, and the outflow was still good, with prices continuing to rise by a corner. The arrival of Yang Du Jian rice was dwindling, and there was a lack of accurate prices. White Yuanhe stocks were not weak, but the appetite was poor. Only a few retail sales were handled, and there was no gain or loss in prices. The trends in the morning and afternoon were not easy to reverse.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Fewer than ten boats arrived from the interior, and the stocks in the port were few. Changxi machine japonica rice was extremely rare here, and sales were still brisk, so prices rose by a corner and a half. The buying interest in Su Tong white japonica rice turned enthusiastic, and the shop's appetite turned to sales, and all had fallen into the hands. Prices rose by another corner to two corners. The production of South Gang Bo Dao and early rice gradually dried up, and the supply to Shanghai was not suitable, so the sources to this port tended to be thin, and the Ning appetite street sales were all purchased. The market was good by a corner. The outflow of Yang Du Jian was not deserted, and the situation was extremely stable. The top-quality rice was closely approaching a corner. General Yin Yuan's arrival and sales were both weak, and the overall trend was flat and tired.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Soars by 3-4 Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened, the market sentiment was still good, and prices for all months rose across the board. In addition, the factories were also inquiring, and retail investors and the North Gang were also interested. September reached as high as 2 liang 4 qian 5 fen 25, which was 4 fen higher than the previous day. Other months rose by 2-3 fen each.

At the close, June was up 1 fen 25, July up 2 fen, August up 2 fen 25, September up 3 fen 25, October up 2 fen 25, and November up 2 fen and a half.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Continues to Arrive With Over a Thousand Bags</h3>
<p>Standards Jumped 8-9 Fen Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the wheat market opened, both the upper and lower markets were seen to be rising step by step. In particular, distant futures saw new bulls joining the buying, and the rise was no less sharp than before. Domestic merchants and factory customers had particularly good intentions. At the close, June was up 2 fen, July up 6 fen, August up 8 fen, September up 7 fen, October up 5 fen, and November up 9 fen. The market situation at the close was still exceptionally bullish. Over a thousand bags of new wheat arrived, and the quality was not yet fully up to par, but the factory appetite was very good. Taipingqiao goods opened at 4 liang 6 qian, middle at 4 liang 5 qian and a half, and secondary at 4 liang 4 qian and a half to 3 qian. Only Chen Che wheat was affected by the new wheat, falling by 3 fen. All kinds of Che wheat opened at 5 liang and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>New Broad Beans Exports Gradually Moving</h3>
<p>This Year's New Broad Beans Crop is Average: Recently, the goods arriving in Shanghai from various merchant groups are all small lots. Wenzhou goods opened at 5 liang 12 qian, and Yuyao goods opened at 6 liang. By yesterday, the market soared because Dongyang dealers were gradually moving their sales, opening at 6 liang 1 qian for Yuyao beans, about 1 qian better, with a total of over 300 bags. The situation is gradually turning official.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market is Thriving</h3>
<p>Taikoo Sugar Continues to Rise by a Qian and a Half: Coarse Sand White Turns to Rising Trend Again</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegram reported that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.375, the price of New York sugar futures in September was 1.47, and the price in December was 1.56, which was 1 point lower than the previous telegram. The price in March of next year was 1.65, and the price in May was 1.72, with no increase or decrease. The current price of Java sugar was 9.625, the price of June sugar futures was 9.375, and the prices in July and August were both 9.25, which was only 125 lower than the previous telegram. At the association market, the price of Dutch sugar #24 coarse sand white was even higher due to the Dutch exchange rate shrinking to 93 guilders. The number of sellers was even fewer, and the buying interest was even more active. The transaction price reached 7 liang 4 qian 7 fen and a half, and the later market rose even higher to 7 liang 5 qian. Although the number of hand transfers was few, the market was still stable and elegant. The market for #20 medium sand white was also quite good at 7 liang 4 qian. The rise in Japanese sugar was quite strong, with N at 7 liang 9 qian and a half, YT at 7 liang 9 qian, YP at 8 liang 1 qian, and YRO at 7 liang 6 qian.

<h3>North and South Goods, New Wood Ear Has Already Appeared Yesterday</h3>
<p>Market Price 108 Liang</p>
<p>New wood ear has arrived. Yesterday, various firms brought 56 packages of new Xing'an ear from Hankou and already showed samples. The goods were still good. Various merchant groups wanted to try the new goods upon hearing the news. The Fuzhou gang bought most of it, and the price was 108 liang. The market was stable. The old goods had no ups or downs.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Foreign Firms, New Silk Market Increasingly Quiet</h3>
<p>Opening Price Insufficient to Cover Silk Costs, Factories Suffer Losses and Do Not Sell</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market for foreign firms in this port became increasingly quiet. Overseas silk prices were not high. Although Qianli and Mitsui and other firms had new factory inventory, the opening price for B-grade medium-grade silk was only 1,120 liang. The factories, due to poor harvests of new cocoons and high cocoon prices, silk costs were more expensive. They were unwilling to sell at a loss and took a firm stance not to sell. Qianjing was also reluctant to form new prices because small prices weighed heavily on costs. Yesterday's market was completely stagnant.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin New Cocoons Have Inferior Quality</h3>
<p>Baking Loss is 320 Jin, Reeling Loss is 850-60 Jin. Jiangyin and Chang (Wujin) and Xi (Wuxi) are the same cocoon production areas. In previous years, the cocoon production was not as abundant as that of Wuxi, but the cocoon quality was comparable to Changxi. This year, due to the unrest in the local banditry, farmers' silkworms have decreased, and the weather is not good. The continuous rainy weather and the disease of the silkworms have caused many to be lost. The harvest of new cocoons has been poor, and the quality of the cocoons is also very poor. The Shanghai factory's new sample cocoons were tested for reeling, and the results showed that 850-60 jin of local species and 550-670 jin of foreign species are required to reel one dan of silk. Baking losses require 320 jin to bake one dan of dry cocoons.</p>
<h3>Zhenmei Green Tea is Suffering a Setback</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the output of Lu Zhuang, Tu Zhuang, and Pingshui, and other green teas was increasingly sluggish. Thousands of boxes of Zhenmei from Tunxi and Shexian have arrived in recent days, and almost no European merchants have inquired about them. The market is showing a significant downturn. Although the high-grade goods of Qimen black tea from Gao Zhuang are still selling well, the selling prices of the middle and low-grade goods have fallen compared to before. Looking at the overall tea market, the future is extremely pessimistic.</p>

<h3>Trends in New Wheat and Flour This Year</h3>
<p>Reasoning</p>
<p>The situation with wheat and flour this year is very different from previous years. The new wheat is about to enter the market, and old stocks will soon be worthless. It is essential to study future trends. Therefore, based on my limited knowledge, I will make some predictions, hoping they will be approved by those concerned about the people's food supply.</p>
<p>"General Discussion" The base price for new wheat this year should be four taels and three mace, and for flour, two taels and three mace. There may be a brief dip in prices at some point, breaking these levels, but this will be fleeting and temporary. There is no doubt about this. I will now elaborate on the various reasons to prove this:</p>
<p>(1) Farmers control the right to sell wheat, and their standard for selling wheat is based on rice prices. Rice is currently selling for twenty yuan, and in some counties in Jiangbei, it even exceeds thirty yuan. Such high prices are unprecedented. Therefore, the abundance or scarcity of this year's new wheat harvest is not the most important issue. I ask, with rice so expensive, who would be willing to sell their hard-earned wheat at a low price? Furthermore, if rice prices remain unstable, I know many places will resort to eating wheat. Except for those living near the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, who are relatively wealthy and accustomed to eating expensive rice and unwilling to eat cheap wheat, people north of the Yangtze River and in provinces like Xu, Huai, Anhui, and Shandong can substitute wheat flour for rice, and even corn (maize) and sorghum can be used for sustenance. Therefore, the supply of new wheat this year will be difficult to increase significantly. The high price of rice affects the wheat supply, that is reason one.</p>
<p>(2) Whether in Shanghai, inland, or in various ports in the north and south, stocks of flour and wheat are very low this year. At this time last year, Shanghai usually had over one million bags of flour in stock, and Tianjin had over four million bags. Currently, Shanghai, despite having many flour mills, is running short. Tianjin, the largest flour consumer in the country, has less than a million bags in stock, according to recent surveys. The difference compared to last year is significant. Therefore, as soon as the new wheat arrives, factories will compete to purchase it. Inland factories are also determined to be the first to act. Therefore, there may be concerns about too many monks and not enough porridge, but no worries about excessive inventory. Scarce inventory makes factory owners compete for wheat prices, making it difficult to reduce prices, that is reason two.</p>
<p>(3) In terms of actual sales, people have been consuming high-priced flour since last winter, roughly around two taels and five and a half mace (equivalent to $3.60). However, the consumption rate has not decreased. It can be seen that flour priced above two taels and five mace is common. The slight sluggishness in sales today is due to the fact that factories are issuing warehouse receipts with delivery dates several days to over ten days away. Therefore, any high prices during this period are futile. With the new wheat arriving soon and prices expected to be lower, merchants are constantly calculating. Therefore, merchants, except for immediate needs, are willing to wait a few days for the new flour. There are no concerns about stagnant sales, that is reason three.</p>
<p>(4) Our country is vast and abundant, with many wheat-producing areas. Although there are no statistics on wheat production, it is definitely impressive. However, transportation is inconvenient and difficult, resulting in the waste of good produce. Continuous internal conflicts and rampant bandits cause farmers to be displaced, unable to cultivate their fields. Therefore, domestic wheat production cannot meet the annual needs of domestic factories. This can be confirmed by past situations. In the past, we relied on wheat and flour imports from the United States and Canada. Customs reports show that in the past five years, imported flour averaged over ten million bags per year. Now, gold prices are high and exchange rates are expensive. If American wheat is shipped to Shanghai for flour production, the cost would be over two taels and eight mace. Unless there are drastic changes in exchange rates, it will be difficult to rely on imports from the United States and Canada. Foreign wheat is difficult to provide relief, that is reason four.</p>
<p>Based on the above four reasons, the price of wheat and flour this year will inevitably rise gradually. If foreign wheat and flour cannot be imported regularly and domestic transportation is frequently disrupted, I fear that unprecedented high prices will occur during the transition between the old and new crops this winter and spring. This is due to environmental pressures and cannot be reversed by human effort. Some may say that according to your argument, there is no hope for a price decrease in wheat and flour this year. Are you being too extreme? I reply, there are opportunities for a decrease. There may be fluctuations due to human factors, market conditions, or the impact of a good autumn harvest. Ups and downs are normal and nothing to be surprised about. Otherwise, if prices only rise without any fluctuations, it would not be a market. However, there is still a glimmer of hope: Japanese flour mills are forming alliances, aiming to sell flour to various ports in northern and southern China. Recently, there have been reports of Japanese flour being peddled in Yantai and Weihaiwei. If this happens, flour consumption should decrease, and the supply and demand situation may ease. The above predictions may be proven wrong. In short, if the country is peaceful, bandits are eliminated, transportation is unobstructed, and goods can flow freely, then not only can wheat and flour prices be stable, but also the people's livelihood can be solved.</p>
<h3>Rice</h3>
<p>One Aspect of Rural Life</p>
<p>Rice is indispensable for the people of Jiangnan. City dwellers, who do not farm, use their silver coins and banknotes to exchange for this food, unaware that every grain is hard-earned. Nowadays, with prices at over twenty yuan per picul, they may complain about the cost of rice, but they do not know that it is even harder for farmers to afford rice.</p>
<p>Farmers grow rice in their fields, so they should have rice to eat and not complain about the cost. If someone asks this, they only know one side of the story. They only know the surface but not the reality. Today, farmers genuinely cannot harvest rice in their fields. The Su (Suzhou) area, known as the land of fish and rice, has a distressing rice production situation. There are too many people and too little land. Each farming household cultivates less than ten mu of land on average. Even if they cultivate ten mu, the custom is to plant five mu with rice and the rest with beans, wheat, cotton, or mulberry trees. In recent years, natural and man-made disasters have come one after another. Although floods do not turn the land into a vast swamp, constant rain can rot the roots of the crops. In dry weather, water conservancy is not maintained, and ditches dry up. Farmers have water-lifting equipment but cannot find water. Last year, in the Changzhou area, they could only watch their rice crops wither and die. Locusts arrive like a million-strong army, covering the sky and the land, causing more damage to the rice crops. The most hateful are the bandits, who run rampant in the countryside, looting homes, causing farmers to be afraid to stay at home, leaving fields barren. Even if there is rice in the fields, they dare not harvest it, allowing it to rot on the ground. Due to these reasons, the rice harvest is greatly reduced or even non-existent. In the past, each mu of rice could yield two or three piculs of rice, but now, averaging one picul is considered extremely fortunate. Five mu of land yield a total of five piculs of rice. How can this small amount of rice feed a family of eight for a year? Therefore, by the second or third month of the following spring, they have already run out of rice. But life is important, so they dare not become hermits who live on mist and dew. They end up buying rice like city dwellers. Their stomachs need to be filled, but their silver coins are not endless. So, they think of reducing rice consumption by eating congee instead of rice because water does not need to be bought. Congee only differs in thickness. Adding more water to the rice results in more food, saving a lot of rice. In addition, wheat flour, taro, and now green broad beans are substitutes for rice. It is even more heartbreaking that many families who cultivate dozens of mu of land also have no rice to cook and must buy it. This is because household expenses are high and there is no other way. As soon as the rice is harvested, they sell the grain or milled rice to get money to meet urgent needs. They sell when new grain is on the market and prices are low. When they have no rice at home and need to buy it, the price is high because there is little rice available. They sell low and buy high. How can this not be heartbreaking? According to surveys, at least six or seven out of ten families in each village must buy rice. With so many people buying rice, how can the price not be high? How can it not be over twenty yuan per picul?</p>
<p>If villagers have no rice to eat, why not plant all the fields with rice? Those who ask this question only know one side of the story. Some fields are suitable for rice, and some are suitable for wheat. Fields suitable for rice are not suitable for wheat, and vice versa. In addition to food, people also have expenses for clothing, housing, weddings, funerals, and other things. The proceeds from growing beans, wheat, and cotton are mostly sold to others to cover these various expenses. If all the fields are planted with rice and, by good fortune, there are no natural or man-made disasters, there may be more rice, and the food problem can be solved, so they will not have to buy rice even after planting it. But where will the funds for other necessities of life come from?</p>
<p>Hoeing the rice paddies at noon, sweat drips onto the soil below. The plate is empty, and a year's work is in vain. Dare I alter an ancient poem to end my article? (Yan also.)</p>
<h3>Story of World Literature (1) (6) (5) by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<h3>Chapter 42: Nineteenth-Century Russian Literature</h3>
<p>Among us, things have taken such a form that the novel—the most trivial and insignificant form in literature—becomes one of two things: either something foolish, or the voice of a guide resounding throughout the empire.</p>
<h3>- Turgenev</h3>
<p>To Western readers who do not know Russian, the significance of Russian literature refers to the Russian novels of the nineteenth century and modern times. This is a limited view that is blind to Russian poetry and other forms of expression. However, there is sufficient reason for this limitation. Novels appeal to a wider audience and cross national borders more easily than other types of writing. Moreover, the Russian novel is a powerful institution, as the critic quoted above suggests. It is more than just a story; it is a voice that resonates not only throughout the Russian Empire, but also throughout Europe. Therefore, what makes it justifiable for us to ignore other parts of Russian literature—even if we have a lot of knowledge of them—is the fact that the Russian novel is extremely rich. Not only that, before the era of great novelists, Russians borrowed from Western Europe, and before they had something new and original to contribute in return, the tide of influence flowed eastward. They drew inspiration from France, Italy, and England, and abandoned their inherent sources of songs and stories.</p>
<p>Although what particularly interests us is the prose novel, the founders of modern Russian literature were two poets, Pushkin and Lermontov. They also wrote prose. Both belonged to the Romantic era of the early nineteenth century, and both were strongly influenced by Byron, as were half of the young writers in Europe.</p>
<p>Pushkin had every literary talent. He was a lyric poet, a dramatic poet, and a storyteller. However, first and foremost, he was a playwright of great power and beauty. Russian composers constantly seek themes from him. The most well-known operas based on his stories and poems are "Eugene Onegin," "Boris Godunov," "Rusalka," and "The Queen of Spades." He had a great and positive influence on all Russian literature after him because he developed a simple style, or rather, he was born with it and achieved his powerful effect through clarity and directness.</p>
<p>Lermontov, like Pushkin, was Byronic, but he also had a touch of Shelley. He was a visionary, interested in the mysterious and spiritual nature of the Russian soul. This interest, which prevails in much of the literature that followed, is a characteristic that gives Russian novels an advantage over those of any other country. Lermontov's main novel is "A Hero of Our Time," which has been translated into many languages, including English. It is set in the Caucasus and reveals the virtues of the mountain people with whom the Russian gentleman must fight, in a romantic, chivalrous spirit. Impartiality in practical life may be necessary, but it is common in novels to see the qualities of others. This can also be said to be distinctively Russian. Both Pushkin and Lermontov, these two guiding literary figures, were killed in duels. Knowing this, we can glimpse the state of literature and society at that time.</p>
<p>The first master of the novel who abandoned Romantic conventions and sought material in life was Nikolai Gogol. His "Dead Souls" is more lively than the title suggests. It depicts many aspects of small-scale Russian society through a series of adventures, filled with humorous sympathy for the common people and satirical contempt for fraud and hypocrisy. Much of the humor is said to be lost in translation, which is probably true, because Gogol was a meticulous observer of rural people. However, in English translations, the essential human spirit shines brightly enough for us to know the greatness of the book. In addition to his talent for satirical observation, Gogol also had a knack for more exciting dramatic elements, which is evident in the story of the war between the Cossacks and the Poles, "Taras Bulba." However, first and foremost, he was the founder of realism. Later Russian novelists, even those who progressed far beyond him, acknowledged his superiority. Later Russian novelists followed the tradition of Gogol rather than Pushkin. This is the opinion of Kropotkin, a respected Russian scholar and former revolutionary. In any case, his own works, which have never stopped being read, and his efforts to draw the novel away from Romanticism and align it with life—efforts that were not consciously critical—make Gogol a great force, as he is now. This much is certain.</p>
<p>The first great progress was achieved by Ivan Turgenev. He, along with Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, are the three giants who dominate the Russian novel. Turgenev's first important work, "A Sportsman's Sketches," depicts the miserable lives of peasants and had a considerable effect on their emancipation from serfdom. Russian novels are not just leisurely stories, but also have practical implications, as has already been mentioned. This is even more evident in Tolstoy's work. In "Fathers and Sons," Turgenev depicts the struggle between the emerging era and the old era, between young people with scientific and intellectual aspirations and old-fashioned, family-loving aristocrats. He used the term "nihilism" for some of the new doctrines, a term that the government used to denigrate all free thought. As a result, Turgenev temporarily lost the support of those he sympathized with. Some years earlier, he had displeased the government with some criticism of officialdom and had been punished with a short period of imprisonment and exile. The life of a Russian writer was a life of indignation and danger. However, Turgenev was, first and foremost, an artist with a sense of form that we consider French, a researcher of humanity, and a lover of beauty. He was both simple and profound. It has been said that no one but Turgenev has ever written a perfect novel. This is an exaggeration, but if it means that most of his novels are nearly perfect, then it is also true. In "On the Eve" and "Spring Torrents," he depicts the poignant beauty of young women. He felt the boredom and cruelty among the Russian people, and understood their deep sorrow because he himself also possessed it. His misfortune was not pathological, but courageous and graceful. His analytical clarity and the simplicity of his stories make him perhaps the clearest interpreter of the Russian character to the rest of the world. Indeed, he is the most easily readable. Only Russians can tell us whether he is more truthful than his great contemporaries. His novels are based more on French models than on the loose and unstructured Russian templates. He spent most of his active life in Paris. Dostoevsky and Tolstoy both thought he was Frenchified, or that there was a danger of becoming so. However, he also returned to Russia from time to time to seek new material. His self-imposed exile made him an admirer of the Russian language. According to Russians, he used the Russian language with ultimate perfection. He wrote with meticulous attention, which is probably something he learned from the French. Indeed, the French influence, no matter what it was for this Russian, did not harm the artist, and not even this Russian as an artist was harmed. Why? Because only an artist who cherishes a prayer for his native language can write such a language, which should not be bestowed upon a great nation. That is unthinkable.</p>

<h3>Sudden Increase in Japanese Bee Imports to China</h3>
<p>Beekeeping is Popular in Tianjin</p>
<p>Market Prices Increase by About 50%</p>
<p>According to Japanese news, the beekeeping industry in Gifu Prefecture, Japan, has been thriving recently. Exports of bees to China began last year, and this spring has seen a significant development. Beekeeping is now popular in the Tianjin area of China, and there are many orders for bees from the prefecture. Since April 1, almost every five days, many bee colonies with queens have been imported into China. Most of them are shipped from Kobe to Tianjin, while others are unloaded in Qingdao and transported to Jinan. Each ship carries about 1,000 to 1,500 colonies. The number of bees in each colony is about 300 to 15,000. Beekeepers in the Seino area, including the Anpachi, Ibi, and Kaizu districts, have benefited unexpectedly. Market prices have also increased from 178 yen to 256 yen per colony, an increase of about 50%, depending on the technology used. In one season, one colony can propagate to two or three or even ten colonies. According to a survey by Dr. Tokuyita, a bee research expert at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there are currently about 10,000 bee colonies in the prefecture, with about 30 specialized beekeepers and others who keep bees as a side business.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Department Creates Internal Medicine to Prevent Dysentery</h3>
<p>Considered Good News for the Infectious Disease Community</p>
<p>Tokyo News: In view of the increasing number of dysentery cases each year, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department plans to create a completely effective internal medicine to prevent the disease. Starting in April of this year, it has been working with Dr. Otsubo, Director of the Bacteriological Examination Institute, and the Chief of the Infection Prevention Department, Iguchi, to develop an oral immunizing agent. The research will be completed before the dysentery epidemic season and will be implemented in June. This medicine will be made into tablets, has no side effects, and will not cause fever or other issues like traditional preventive injections. It is easy to use. In addition, the Ministry of Health plans to create an oral immunizing agent for typhoid fever using the same method and is currently conducting research. It has decided that if it is implemented, it will abolish traditional preventive injections and use this internal medicine exclusively. Both are good news for the infectious disease prevention community.</p>
<h3>Research on Using Chemicals to Eliminate Weeds</h3>
<p>Potassium Chlorate is Effective</p>
<p>The use of chemicals to eliminate weeds and make cultivated crops suitable for cultivation has been studied in Europe and the United States. Recently, the United States discovered that potassium chlorate is effective. Mr. Itano of the Kurashiki Ohara Agricultural Research Institute in Okayama Prefecture, Japan, is conducting further experimental research to study the effectiveness of potassium chlorate in Japanese soil and how to use it to create perfect cultivated crops. He has published his research results, stating that potassium chlorate is effective in eliminating weeds on hard surfaces such as tennis courts, and can also kill weeds in ordinary cultivated land. Seeds can be cultivated effectively about three weeks later. The amount used varies depending on the type of weed, but generally, about 12.5 to 32 catties are needed per ten mu. According to Itano, the use of this medicine is most effective for weed removal along railway lines or newly reclaimed land. It can save expenses, reduce labor, and is extremely beneficial.</p>
<h3>Wealth Can Connect Earth and Moon</h3>
<p>The $200 Million Fortune of the Kerosene King</p>
<p>Two Dollars Per Minute Since the Birth of Jesus</p>
<p>According to an investigation and publication by Mr. Allen, the president of the New York Academy of Public Sciences, the total wealth of the American Kerosene King Rockefeller amounts to $200 million. If this amount were converted into ten-dollar bills and connected end to end, they could link the Earth and the Moon. Moreover, aligning it with time, from the birth of Jesus, he has earned an average of two dollars per minute. Furthermore, the wealth Rockefeller has donated to date, if divided into ten-dollar bills and connected end to end, could circle the Earth three times. This does not include the interest, which alone exceeds the annual income of 15,000 American laborers. It is also said that Rockefeller's donations to various universities and scientific organizations have reached $60 million.</p>

<h3>General Motors Corporation China Branch A</h3>
<p>By D. V. France, Sales Director of General Motors China Branch in Shanghai</p>
<p>The General Motors Manufacturing Corporation of America, in view of the increasing importance of the Chinese automobile market, has specially established a branch in China. In recent years, the Chinese people have recognized the necessity of improving transportation. From the government to the people, all are striving to promote road construction. The planning of new railways and the construction of provincial roads are obvious indications of this. Indeed, with the convenience of transportation, all industries will develop accordingly. The security and prosperity of a country depend on it. With the increasing number of roads, automobile transportation is attracting everyone's attention. Automobiles excel in speed and convenience, require less investment, and have lower costs. The strength and prosperity of the United States is also due to automobiles. China's transportation has always been underdeveloped, and the number of railway miles is extremely small. Now, if we want to actively promote the convenience of transportation, automobiles are the most effective way to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Moreover, China has vast land and abundant resources, and the transfer of goods between provinces is best achieved</p>
<p>Continentally. General Motors' production accounts for 34% of the total in the United States. In other words, one out of every three cars is a General Motors car. The scope of General Motors' export trade is also immense. Currently, General Motors' market covers 114 countries of all sizes. Last year, General Motors cars and trucks sold abroad totaled 256,721 units, worth US$244,304,631. According to the total number of automobiles produced in the United States and Canada and sold abroad, General Motors accounts for about 37%.</p>
<p>There are now over 10,000 General Motors cars and trucks in China, of which 3,500 were imported last year. General Motors' six-cylinder Chevrolet cars are the most popular in China.</p>
<h3>General Motors Student Internship</h3>
<p>The situation of students at the Shanghai General Motors School during their internship</p>
<p>. Cars are very economical. General Motors Corporation is the largest automobile company in the world. It has always been a leader in the automobile industry. It produces the most types of vehicles and has a spirit of aggressive business. General Motors has great hopes for the Chinese automobile market. In the future, the influence of General Motors products in China will be considerable.</p>
<p>General Motors was founded 20 years ago with an initial capital of only US$10 million. It was formed by merging the Buick, Oldsmobile, and Cadillac automobile companies. Today's General Motors is very different from the past. Its capital exceeds US$3 billion, and it manufactures 12 types of vehicles. The names of the cars are as follows:</p>
<p>Chevrolet cars and trucks, Oakland Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Walkerville, Marquette, Buick, Vauxhall, LaSalle, Cadillac, General Motors trucks. In addition to manufacturing a large number of automobiles, General Motors also operates many other businesses, such as Fokker and Tuni Aircraft Company, American United Wireless Electric Company, and Davenko Lee May Electric. General Motors has over 100 factories in the United States, with no fewer than 250,000 workers and staff. The annual turnover is astonishing. To give an example, the total number of vehicles produced last year was 1,860,403, worth US$1,504,444,472. In North America, their prices are particularly low, and the cost is extremely economical. Both are suitable for the situation in China. The price of a six-cylinder Chevrolet is the same as that of a four-cylinder car, but the engine is the latest type, with great power, high speed, and extremely economical fuel consumption. All countries in the world welcome the new Chevrolet. As a result, in 1929, a total of 1.35 million Chevrolet cars were sold.</p>
<p>General Motors' great achievements are not only due to the high and low prices and wide range of uses of the cars it manufactures, but also because its products are of the highest value in the automobile industry. General Motors Corporation's financial resources can be described as extremely abundant. In terms of talent, whether it is mechanical or scientific, there is no shortage. The manufacturing equipment is the latest and most sophisticated. In addition, it has established the industry's first research institute, specializing in the improvement of materials and manufacturing. Before a new car is built, it must first be test-driven on the ground. For this purpose, a vast test track has been specially built. Furthermore, General Motors implements mass production, and also purchases raw materials in bulk. As a result, the cost is lower, and the price is also lower. The benefit to the seller is considerable.</p>
<p>General Motors' overseas sales methods are thorough and widespread. Managers in various places have established repair stations to provide customers with repairs and replacements. All services are the same as in the United States. General Motors' service covers the globe, reaching even the most remote areas. General Motors has 24 branches and agencies overseas. Recently, it acquired the German Abel Automobile Factory. In China, there are two branches: one in Shanghai, which specializes in central China, and one in Shenyang, which covers North China, the three northeastern provinces, and Mongolia. Chinese managers and branch managers are successively established in important cities. The service is as thorough as in other parts of the world. Shanghai and Shenyang each have warehouses. General Motors cars and trucks are available in stock, eliminating the need for long waits for orders. In addition, Shanghai has a central parts warehouse with an inventory worth 300,000 yuan to supply all managers for timely replenishment and to ensure there are no shortages. The roads in various parts of China are mostly uneven, and automobile parts are easily</p>
<h3>Chevrolet Transportation to Tianjin</h3>
<p>The automobile transportation business in Tianjin is also very developed. The picture shows a row of Chevrolet trucks being transported to Tianjin. It is a photograph taken after they were fully assembled.</p>
<p>Damaged. General Motors parts can be replaced immediately at any time. This is extremely convenient for customers. The China Branch has specially established a service department, headed by a specialist, to assist General Motors managers in various locations to organize the latest type of repair stations. General Motors Branch also has an automobile school in Shanghai to allow managers from various places and public and private institutions engaged in the General Motors automobile transportation business to send mechanics to Shanghai to study. As for publicity, many Chinese brochures and booklets are printed each year. Recently, there are plans to compile a standard automobile terminology book in order to have a unified set of specialized names in China. From this point of view, the establishment of General Motors China Branch involves a considerable investment. There is no doubt that it has deep confidence in the future development of China's automobile industry.</p>
<h3>Optimism About the Future of Automobiles</h3>
<p>Observations from the General Manager of Operations</p>
<p>The future development of automobiles can only be determined by looking at the position that automobiles occupy today and the number of annual sales. In recent years, the development of the automobile industry has indeed been rapid. Even the annual increase in the number of road miles in various countries is considerable. As for the improvement of road administration, it is also very urgent. All of these things increase the value of automobiles themselves and inspire their great functions.</p>
<p>[</p>
<h3>General Motors Shanghai Showroom</h3>
<p>The latest showroom of the General Motors Corporation Shanghai Branch, located at No. 3 North Yangtze Road in this city. The two cars in the picture are the new 1930 Buick cars.</p>
<p>Clothing, food, shelter, and transportation are the four major necessities of life. Now, the fourth thing is transportation. In the past, our actions, travels, explorations, and expeditions all relied on the inconvenience of manual transportation. Since the advent of automobiles, transportation has become much more convenient and faster, and human expectations have been satisfied.</p>
<p>Scientific development can be said to have reached its peak. It is expected that there will be few more contributions to the automobile industry in the future. However, the function of automobiles will still be a convenient tool for personal transportation. There is no doubt about that.</p>
<p>A few years ago, some people thought that after the appearance of airplanes, automobiles would have one more enemy. In fact, that is not the case. Airplanes and automobiles are like radios and newspapers. The two are related. For example, airplanes fly in the sky, and the passengers inside mostly use cars to travel back and forth. More clearly, the engine organization principles of airplanes and automobiles are similar. The latter is easier to use and costs less.</p>
<p>The airplane business has been around for 25 years, 10 years later than automobiles. In the past 12 months, the total number of airplanes produced was only lower than Chevrolet's production for one and a half days. It can be seen that the need for automobiles is ten thousand times greater than that for airplanes. However, in terms of the ratio of airplane and automobile production in recent years, they are about the same. Therefore, the development of these two types of transportation will definitely go hand in hand.</p>
<p>Major automobile companies around the world must first be familiar with the business details of various places and their social needs before engaging in commerce. Among automobile manufacturers, only General Motors Corporation has indeed spent time and effort to focus on studying the future problems of the automobile market. After investigation, it has obtained several important principles that are sufficient to predict the rise and fall of the automobile industry in the future.</p>
<p>The most important principle is the replacement of old and new vehicles. Recently, European and American countries have been scrapping old cars once a year in order to rectify the car business. In the United States alone, there are more than 3 million vehicles. After this large number of old cars are destroyed, they must be replaced with new cars. During this period of replacement, the number of new cars manufactured by various factories this year will definitely increase unexpectedly.</p>
<p>The replacement period has now been realized. In the history of automobiles, it is indeed</p>
<h3>Chevrolet Sells Well Overseas</h3>
<p>Chevrolet automobiles sell well all over the world. The picture above shows new Chevrolets being packed in wooden boxes and loaded onto ships in New York, USA. The truck carrying this car is the General Motors truck from the General Motors factory. Its annual sales in China are the highest of all cars, which shows its great reputation.</p>
<p>A major change. Even the concept of the function of automobiles in the past and present has seen strange insights. In the past, people regarded automobiles as luxury goods and were wary of them. Now, that is no longer the case. The importance of automobiles has changed from a luxury item for the nobility to a tool for life and career. The faith of modern people in automobiles has increased rather than decreased. Therefore, the future of automobiles is limitless.</p>
<p>The trend of families owning automobiles is also increasing due to the trend. It is difficult to predict the future situation. However, the number of self-owned cars has been increasing sharply in recent years. Many families in Europe and America own two or three cars. This is not only convenient for family use, but also adds to the glory of the family. This is another reason why automobiles will definitely develop further in the future.</p>
<p>At a time of fierce commercial competition and the development of transportation, automobile transportation is the lifeblood of a country's business. In recent years, the number of vehicles manufactured by automobile factories in various countries has broken the previous record due to this automobile production. And the production of trucks is also increasing day by day and month by month due to commercial needs. Based on this speculation, the future of automobiles is limitless. This is something that the world will definitely praise and be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>Chevrolet's Huge Production</h3>
<p>1.35 Million Vehicles Manufactured in 1929</p>
<p>The total number of Chevrolet cars and trucks produced in 1929 has increased again, 150,000 more than in 1928. Last year's production was 1.35 million vehicles, and all of them were six-cylinder cars. From this, it can be seen that Chevrolet is very popular.</p>
<p>Last year's manufacturing results, whether daily, weekly, or monthly, all exceeded previous records. The strangest thing is that 1 million of these 1.35 million passenger cars</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Were manufactured and shipped out in eight months. This is because the first six-cylinder Chevrolet went on sale on January 1 last year, and by August, there were already 1 million vehicles on the market. Chevrolet's production in May last year was the highest, with 160,865 vehicles. As for the production in recent years, please refer to the table on the left to show Chevrolet's great progress year by year.</p>
<h3>General Motors Trucks Are Strong</h3>
<p>The 1930 General Motors trucks are stronger and the bodies are more durable. Each truck has a carrying capacity of about 5,000 tons. The picture shows 37 students from the General Motors Automobile School established by the Shanghai General Motors Corporation. All of them are standing on the rear wheels of the General Motors car. The total weight is 4,900 tons, which is about twice the normal carrying capacity. The rear wheels can withstand it, which shows the strong resistance of the rear springs of General Motors trucks.</p>
<p>1924 309,000 vehicles</p>
<p>1925 510,000 vehicles</p>
<p>1926 728,000 vehicles</p>
<p>1927 1,001,000 vehicles</p>
<p>1928 1,200,000 vehicles</p>
<p>1929 1,350,000 vehicles</p>
<h3>General Motors Cars Reach Everywhere</h3>
<p>The Qiqihar Bank in Heilongjiang Province also operates automobile transportation, mostly transporting rice, wheat, and other grains. They drive every day in wind, sand, rain, and snow. Their service is truly commendable. As a result, their business has developed. The trucks used by the bank are all General Motors trucks. They are powerful, fuel-efficient, and economical. Since they started using them, they have all expressed their satisfaction.</p>
