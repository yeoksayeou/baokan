<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界人心之浮動</h3>
<p>當歐戰告終之後世界人心鑒於歐戰損失之重大莫不厭惡戰爭兢兢以消滅第二次世界大戰爲務。數年之間。旣因各國之筋疲力盡。不得不暫時休息。復因此厭戰之心理。與多數人弭戰之呼號。得以棲息較爲和平之下。及至今日。休息之時稍久。人心之浮動。又復因之而起。據芝加哥議員游歐回美者之言。謂不久恐將又有第二次世界大戰之發生。因歐洲各國近來對於戰備競爭。遠過於一九一二年歐戰之時。而國際間之猜忌心。亦較歐戰前烈。法國近在意界邊境之陸軍大操。及在多隆附近之海軍大操。實含有對付意相墨索里尼武力野心之用意。德國最近之選舉。亦爲修改凡爾賽和約之預兆云云。是其觀察歐陸之情形。甚爲憂懼也。</p>
<p>又白俄機關報載。蘇俄人民委員魯那乍斯基。對於美國新聞記者之談話。謂如今各强國之軍縮條約。徒欺世人。各國軍備依然競爭。蘇俄被迫。亦不得不有紅軍魯氏又謂。波瀾政策。依然感情用事。蘇俄現在雖無攻擊波瀾之意。但若波瀾欲與蘇俄作戰。則紅軍迅即痛擊之。倘羅馬尼亞。與波軍聯合。則紅軍亦不辭與之一戰。其言誠咄咄逼人哉。</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>甲婦哎喲。我打碎了一面鏡子。據說要交七年惡運的。這便怎麽處。這便怎麽處。</p>
<p>乙婦你不要擔心。去年我嫂子打碎了一面鏡子。後來不到半年就死了。所以七年的惡運。一年都没有交到。你怕甚麽呢。</p>
<p>藥店主人半夜三更。驚人好夢。畢竟是生了甚麽天大的病。</p>
<p>主顧對不起。我内人胸口不舒。</p>
<p>藥店主人那麽吃一杯白開水好了。你又要買甚麽藥啊。快說快說。</p>
<p>主顧謝謝你提醒了我。我回去給伊吃白開水去。不要買你的藥了。</p>
<p>男親愛的。我們這回私奔。非同小可。一切都須當心。我們從窗子裏縋下去。那繩子可堅牢麽。</p>
<p>女不打緊。横豎父親和母親在房間裏給我們拉住着。决不會跌下去的。倘嫌他們二老氣力小。那麽可請哥哥帮忙。</p>
<p>眼科醫生小姐。你這眼藥每天須搽三次。不可忘懷。</p>
<p>病眼者先生。但是服藥有一定的。有的須在飯前。有的須在飯後。我搽這眼藥。應當怎麽樣。</p>
<h3>日本之不景氣寫眞</h3>
<p>— 鶴</p>
<p>日本自濱口組閣金解禁政策實行後。不景氣景象益彰。近數月來。知識界及勞動界之失業者與日俱增當局者及政治學者。雖費許多腦筋研究出不景氣打開對策。總是杯水車薪。無濟於事。</p>
<p>不景氣的惡潮。充滿了日本全國。在報紙上我們看到日本有許多地方的人民。吃樹皮草根。猶如我國的陜甘災民一樣。就是在稱爲世界五大都會之一的東京。也處處都可看出不景氣來。</p>
<p>日本橋京橋銀座三處合起有二華里長的一條大街。是日本最有名的夜市。日人稱之爲夜之街。每晚上燈時分。街兩旁擺滿了各種物品廉售的攤兒。遊人肩摩踵接。不知凡幾。在這條街上的大百貨店。如三越松板屋等。都是到夜九時收塲。在這五層高的樓上。下看燈火輝煌。遊人濟濟。電車汽車來往如梭的大街。實在有說不盡的都市美。但是現在這條街上的夜市。已經受時代的淘汰了。昨日前去遊玩時。只見燈火零落。攤木架兒東倒西歪。没有乘客的汽車。來往呌着。十分鐘的間隔。才看見有獨眼的電車。從遠處慢慢的到來。</p>
<p>淺草區觀音堂的旁邊。有一條電影街。在這街上。除兩三家香烟店而外。其餘完全是電影院或芝居（日本戲）院。記得去年過年的時候。我曾往彼處去看戲。距開演時間尚有一小時。但各戲院的門口。都掛上滿員的牌兒了。現在再去看看。景象大變了。所有一百家左右的電影院已經有十分之三休業。其餘尚在支持着的各院。在門口又都添了一個宣傳員。每逢遊客走過時。他滿口報告。今天戲劇的節目。戲的有趣。及大减價等等的話。但是遊客們。好像是鐵石作的。一點也不爲他所引動。</p>
<p>各遊玩塲所。客人是少了。但是圖書館及公園裏。遊人反增多了。失業者每日閑居。則往公共圖書館裏去看雜誌畫報及新聞廣告。他們終日的在那裏。連飯也不出來吃。他們並不是發憤忘食。實在是囊空如洗呀。到夜晚疲倦的時候。公園便是他們的宿所。</p>
<p>國民敎育雖好的日本國民。因爲生計無出路。不能不有軌外行動。所以盜竊及放火案。近日來已經打破日本的新記錄。腹餓倒斃街頭。生計無法。殺妻子。而行自殺者。日有所聞不景氣惡魔横行。看他們用什麽手段對付。</p>
<h3>陜州發見之古物</h3>
<p>— 嵇觀</p>
<p>頃據友人通訊云。陜州僻處山隅。交通梗阻。上月適有西北科學考察圑道經其地。見土人從事狩獵。獲一黄鼠狼洞。奮力下掘。至五尺許。忽覺有物横覆其上。視之爲古代石箭石斧石刀等屬。蒼苔斑剥。古色盎然。計共有五十餘件。一時轟傳。爭先快覩。嗣經圑員辨認。斷爲洪荒前新石器末期及銅器初期之遺物。距今約三千餘年。斯時中國尚未入文字記載時代也。</p>
<p>此外又發見竹簡大小二百餘片。上端鐫有元始元康地節始元等年號。文字均係漢隸。挺秀無比。足爲歷史家一種參考資料。然是物也。埋藏地下。幾二千年。其所以經久不壞者。實地上乾燥。終年少雨之故。聞該圑現已考察完竣。滿載而歸。其將來對於科學上之貢獻。自非淺尠云。</p>
<h3>觀秋潮到九堡</h3>
<p>— 張慶華</p>
<p>浙江錢塘秋潮。爲吾浙有名之大觀。每逢汎期。中外游賓之慕名前往者。不可以數計。因此立使偏僻之海寗。名震遐邇。然觀衆祇知海寗爲觀潮目的地。而不知離海寗東約二十里之八堡九堡間。尤爲大觀乎。其來勢之猛。遠勝海寗。因該地適逢南潮相遇。二潮相擊。恒高十餘丈。旋回低成一曲線形。後再重振旗鼓。奔騰往海寗。故海寗偶或有高潮突起。乃係八堡間餘波之反擊耳。</p>
<p>去歲浙民廳長朱家驊。曾偕海寗縣長閻幼甫。蒞臨一賞。嘆爲奇觀。今年因天時關係。潮汎尤爲兇猛。該處堅固之大石塘。爲潮水衝毁者。共計百數十丈。即在該處經奧國工程師督造試建之新式斜坡大石塘。亦爲猛潮所衝破。更在九堡東附近處。江潮竟越三條防潮塘而衝入内河陳墳江。即離海塘約半里許之杭平汽車路。亦爲潮水入内衝斷。故其來勢之猛。相擊之高。形勢之偉大。在在均令人贊嘆不止。因記此。爲觀衆作介紹焉。</p>
<h3>神女小誌</h3>
<p>— 沈衡莊</p>
<p>美國銀幕上最負盛名之古典美人考侖葛萊菲士。本年春間。爲第一國家公司主演一歷史香艷聲劇。其名曰神女DioioeLady</p>
<p>該劇情節。完全根據名作家Earrington氏之名著神女。而攝爲描寫十八世紀英吉利大英雄納爾遜與美女哀瑪漢密爾敦之艷事。如火如荼。極盡其寫情之能。而成爲影片界絶未有過之古裝聲劇矣。</p>
<p>考侖在此片中。即扮演美人哀瑪嫵媚温柔。較以前諸作。益見娟好。總之。第一國家公司之攝製此片。考侖之主演斯劇。可稱爲兩大成功。今該片正在夏令配克開映云。</p>
<h3>曾農髯之惜名</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>曾農髯之歸道山。同文已紀其軼事矣。尚有未詳盡者。爰再述之。農髯。諱熙。衡陽人。書名播海内。寫一扇一册輙落落疏疏。數行而上。然古逸有奇氣。他人雖傚慕莫能如也。有時兼事丹青。予於心漢閣藏扇中。見其所作山水一幀。蒼茫渾厚。直迫古人。求諸時流。罕與伯仲。但畫爲書名所掩。知之者甚少耳。有方蘭臯者。農髯之鄉人也。去歲蘭臯有事來滬。訪農髯於其寓邸。他鄉故知。倍極歡洽。時氣候燠熱。蘭臯手揮一摺扇。農髯取觀之。則已之手筆。於二十年前藻貽蘭臯者。自覺筆力穉弱。不可示人。迺索諸蘭臯而撕毁之。窮一日之力。精心成佳構以爲償。其惜名不苟有如此。農髯又工詩。然道貌岸然。不屑爲香籨兒女子語。海上畫家張善孖君。作十二金釵圖。求之題詠。農髯固却。及披讀其圖。則所謂十二金釵者。非傳情閨闥。乃斑斕虎畫十二頭也。遂頻呼狡獪。一笑題之。農髯曾客某處逆旅。忽駐兵譁變。夜出肆掠。旅客驚惶失措。紛紛滅燭而匿身暗陬。農髯獨神定不懾。熒然燈火。故傾箱而翻篋。案座亂位。以爲疑陣。變兵果以爲刦灰不足覬觎。竟秋毫而未犯。其他旅客。無一倖免。咸稱佩其有急智不置。旅客中有貲用罄絶。進退維谷者。農髯反助以資斧。俾得遄返云。</p>
<h3>南洋游記（五七）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十四日訪檳城新領事楊筱堂。上海人。通粵語。昨承其過訪。幸得晤之。談及初來此地情形。以聯合中外友誼爲主。但現外交部變更僑民出洋章程。出國回國。均須護照。每章須八元。領事已出告示於僑民。其章自六月一日實行。不知推行有阻否。因每日船出口。一船上有華民千數。若必須納照。在工人方面亦一問題也。</p>
<p>至各埠人民往來在英屬各州府者。平時往來並不問護照。今回中國而用護照。工人以爲加重負担。其往各港口者。三等艙不用護照。而有須人頭稅者。往安南須三十元。工人上岸行李先繳下。拿三十元來贖。往荷蘭者。須一百盾。每盾約當滬銀一元。此數抵當六個月。六個月不出境。即没收。出境仍歸還。往呂宋者。聞每人登岸須十六元。今更將增加。又故意苛待以檢查身體。秤量衛生。其實不過藉口留難而已。人言荷屬昔以此法待日本人。而荷人至日。日本人亦以此法待荷人。其後荷人遂不敢施於日本。而互相優待。惟施於吾華人。以荷蘭小邦乃虐待華人如此。又聞暹羅待華人入境。亦甚糜煩。將來吾華人殆不易出國矣。哀哉。</p>
<p>二十五日至鶴山極樂寺參觀各玉石佛像。余初到南洋。感覺一種趣味。即玉石佛像。在新嘉坡大抵各寺均有。非玉而石質潔白可愛。其像亦與中土異。不類中國人。大抵佛像各以其地而異。日本佛像似日本。蒙古佛像似蒙古人。近印度佛像似印度人。然則此地佛像較眞切也。玉石佛像。各地有大有小。小者一二元。大者數十數百元。高過人身。不論眞幻。一見其秀眉淡致。令人生超世之感。昔康德論美學結果歸於無關心。佛像即深入此二昧者。故爲美之至。較之今銅像。不過表示雄性者。大耐尋味。余訪此像來歷。云在缅甸之仰光。余在國内數十年少見玉石佛像。止爲上海盛宣懷氏之玉佛寺。蓋中國罕有也。此像應設法流通各國以化殺風。聞其石亦有精粗。或飾以金更佳。其不類雲南之大理石。計若雲南路通。亦可於雲南造也。聞此間怡保亦有此石。特不多耳。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（二八二）</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>章乙青回頭想想。覺得自已有些對不住這個女人。雖然伊現在也没有不舒服。但是在名義上。却是非驢非馬。只得極力的安慰伊一下子。那女人揩着眼涙說道。你要討一個人。我是久有此心的了。一個人到了中年以後。自然總要想膝下有個兒子。偏偏我是身體不好。不會生育。你討了人以後。倘然生得一男半女。也是好的。你的兒女。也就是我的兒女。我當然也是一樣看待的。你以爲你討了人。我要吃醋。所以瞞住了我。你眞不知道我的心事。委實是錯怪了人。章乙青聽得如此說。心就放下了一半。因想大概伊也自已覺得年老色衰。况且大家到了中年。伊也就覺悟過來了。那倒並不是什麽强盜發善心。也是實在的話。因道。你能如此的體諒我。我也感激不盡。我所以不告訴你的原因。並不是存心要瞞你。因爲你是有病的。也許你心中不快活。因而氣出了病來。覺得不好。所以想慢慢交告訴你。那女人道。不過我有一個意思。不知道你肯聽不肯聽。我的意思。那種年紀輕的人。住在外面。總有點照顧不到。從前你因爲瞞我。不給家裏人知道。所以只好在外面借小房子。現在横豎我也已經知道的了。用不着再瞞人的了。何不把伊搬回家中來呢。第一。你也省得兩頭跑。第二。現在時世艱難。到底開銷也省一點。第三。家裏也閙熱點。第四。我到底比伊年紀也大一點。喫飯也比伊多喫幾年飯。有的地方。我可以指點一下伊。讓伊家裏的事。也可以帮帮我的忙。他們堂子裏出身的人。老實不客氣。一點也不知道家政的。多少可以學點人家人的規矩。你道對不對。原來章乙青聽見伊說出他的秘密機關來。心中早别别的跳個不住。以爲不知道要怎樣的大閙。因爲從前章乙青嫖堂子没有回家。曾經閙過好幾回的。現在非但不閙。而且說出那種可憐的話來。心中倒有點侷促不安。而且此刻所說的話。都是光明正大。仁至義盡的話。你還要怎麽樣呢。伊許你討姨太太。討了來。伊還肯指點伊。敎導伊。那是再好也没有的了。本來兩頭跑是不大好。兩個家庭的開銷。當然也比較大。伊的話都是很對的。章乙青想。旣然說明白了。自然敎翠筠搬回來爲是。</p>

<h3>星期日銀根驟緊</h3>
<p>洋厘高至三分五厘三七五</p>
<p>銀拆亦抬漲至一錢五分</p>
<p>連日洋厘趨勢躐等而上銀根形勢似仍平穩詎昨日因值星期銀行封關應需銀欵頭襯流動窒碍以致銀拆大舉抬漲早市爲一錢五分較前日早市頓高七分午市略回二分計爲一錢三分爲下半年所最高之價洋厘市價昨亦繼續增昻數亳爲早市七錢三分五厘一亳二忽半午市爲七錢三分五厘三亳七忽半結果較前日午市好起三亳七忽半做出交易洋匯劃票欵早市五十七萬午市四十一萬鈔票早市及午市各做出五千場外鈔票早市七萬五千午市四萬小錢莊買賣鈔票匯頭五十餘萬銀行方面無論銀洋各種交易及收解概以休業無消息錢莊洋公單收解三百十餘萬銀公單收解二千四百餘萬拆票交易七八百萬小同行做開江南小洋早市做出市價爲六錢五分五厘午市做出市價爲六錢五分四厘差額一厘市氣安謐做出交易早市一萬角午市五千角廣東小洋早市爲六錢三分九厘午市爲六錢三分九厘七亳半做出交易早市十六萬角午市十九萬角鋼元改長五百爲三百八十四千五百文</p>
<h3>銀緊之繇來</h3>
<p>銀條存底不豐鑄洋不敷供給</p>
<p>滬埠自金貴風潮澎湃以還現銀市上之充斥爲往昔所罕覯政府及市當局誠恐市面有特殊變端禁金出口而禁銀進口遂使外來生銀無法來滬轉將滬存大條裝往香港各埠於是外表銀根奇鬆面實在對於銀之存底遠不逮上年之多此次因洋厘將有漲風時金融界設法請求杭幣廠開爐但原料缺乏未能儘量鼓鑄故每日祗鑄洋二十四萬雖出幣不多而供給原料大條每日須一百數十條確費籌劃而市面上之供給不敷甚巨結果洋厘仍舊騰貴而原料大條枯窘關係轉致銀根亦趨緊勢銀拆遂有昨日之抬漲矣惟據業中人推測今日（星期一）銀行開關頭襯活動或能稍稍回鬆云</p>

<h3>主席報告</h3>
<p>各位同志各界代表今天是朱執信先生殉國十週年紀念日就是紀念民國九年的今天本黨的先烈總理的信徒中華民國的創造者和維護者朱執信先生給桂系軍閥謀害的一天朱先生爲國家爲民族而犧牲固然值得我們紀念就是他平日一舉一動學問道德也是值得我們熱烈的紀念的朱先生天資非常聰頴他幼時又受到他父親很好的敎訓所以他在十六歲時四書五經二十四史等國學已有很深刻的研究一切科學的常識也無所不知十六歲以後他又研究數學因爲他感覺到數學是一切科學的根本所以代數以至微積分都非常精通的二十歲以後他在日本研究政治法律所以朱先生對於社會科學也有深遠的研究他回國以後又研讀英文俄文仗了他絶頂的聰慧和刻苦的用功因此無論那一國艱深的文字他没有不通曉的這是朱先生求學的經過情形他後來到社會上來做事他就致力於革命文字上的鼓吹更爲努力帮助經理在日本組織中華革命黨號召了同志創辦民報宣揚革命的眞締闡明革命的理論鼓舞革命的勇敢使全國民衆都從大夢中覺醒參加革命運動推翻滿清政府所以朱先生和胡漢民先生戴季陶先生廖仲愷先生等四位在當初是帮助總理作文字上鼓吹的健將朱先生不但在文字上努力宣傳革命在行動上也是非常努力的鎭南關之役朱先生便主持一切三月二十九日黄花崗一役朱先生也參加在内當初朱先生穿的是一襲竹布長衫他覺得長衫不便便截去半件領導許多同志衝進廣州衙署那次雖未遭難但也受了重傷了後來討袁護法諸役朱先生也都參加反革命派一日不消滅朱先生的奮鬥精神革命勇氣也一日不會停止的於是朱先生生前不絶不奮鬥與反動派作殊死戰終於爲桂系軍閥所謀害朱先生終於在民國九年爲革命而犠牲了這是朱先生一生革命工作的大概情形同時朱先生還有幾種美德也决不是般人所能及得到的第一是儉撲的精神朱先生穿的是布衣布袴吃的是青菜淡飯住的房屋尤其異常狹小簡陋他當初亡命在日本的時候經濟已非常窘迫但常有外省的同志向他借錢的時候他没有不應允的即使他自已没有他也設法去挪助人家第二是朱先生的積極的奮鬥精神朱先生一生逢到多少艱難困苦但是他絲毫不消極他對於一般見難而退臨陣脫逃的革命黨人他是總很慷慨的說我們吃的是老百姓的穿的是老百姓的住的是老百姓的我們再不替老百姓做事還能算是一個人嗎他何嘗不知道反動派欲得他而甘心但他絲毫不畏懼不害怕不消極他寗願爲反動派狙擊不願畏懼反動派的謀害苟生把革命工作停止他是有生爲革命而生死爲革命而死的革命人生觀所以養成了他積極奮鬥的精神第三朱先生的高深的學問也是一般同志所及不到的戴季陶先生說朱先生讀的書比我多理解力比我高因此他的學問也比我高深中山先生說陳英士對於革命的認識非常準確革命的精神也不是普通一般人所能及到不過他的學問覺得差一點執信的革命的認識和精神和英士差不多但執信的學問却比英士高得多胡漢民先生也曾說過朱執信先生能夠把世界諸著名學者的學說理論融會貫通固然是執信先生的刻苦用功但也是執信先生的偉大獨到處現在朱先生爲反動派所謀害已經有十年了十年後的今天反動派的逆燄還是没有完全消滅帝國主義者壓迫中國更是一天利害一天先烈已是犠牲了以後的責任是要我們後死者去擔負今天我們紀念朱先生殉國明白了朱先生的革命的一生明白朱先生的奮鬥好學的精神以後應該如何去效法朱先生的繼續朱先生的精神人格事業以完成中國艱難困苦的革命工作現在北方政局已陷於總崩潰的局面閻馮汪諸逆的剷除已不成問題不過反動勢力剷除以後如何建設新中華民國如何實現總理的遺敎如何解除苦難時代的中國民衆的痛苦希望在座的各位同志各界代表在今天紀念朱執信先生殉國紀念應该深深地反省切實地去努力的報告完了</p>
<h3>代表演說</h3>
<p>陶百川演說云各位同志今天是朱執信先生殉國十週年紀念日我們今天特地開會紀念他我相信不特我們上海開會紀念他就是全國各地凡是國民黨勢力所及到的地方莫不開會紀念不但現在我們紀念就是過去而論自從朱執信先生殉國以後凡是知道朱先生的莫不在紀念他非但過去和現在是如此就是將來二十週以後我相信紀念朱先生的悼惜朱先生的一定格外多格外熱烈過去爲國而犧牲的很多但是我們爲什麽紀念年先生特别的熱烈呢他的理由主席已經很詳盡的報告過去了把朱先生的精神事業人格已經作了一個詳細扼要的介紹兄弟現在單提出一點來加以引仲解釋我覺得朱先生之所以值得我們紀念就是天下爲公的公字朱先生一生的事業是爲公朱先生的死也是爲公而死死本不是一件奇怪的事我們决不是因爲朱先生死的那樣慘酷而紀念他同時朱先生在生前做文章的時候說話的時候隨時隨地準備着死的因爲一個革命黨員等到他踏上革命戰線的時候早就把死的命運注定了的死不足奇我們當然也不必以朱先生死得那樣慘苦而紀念他我們所以紀念朱先生是因爲朱先生並不是爲個人而死爲功名富貴而死爲聲色貨利而死完全爲公而死所以才值得我們五體投地的紀念他民國九年恰好是歐洲大戰結束民國四年到民國八年的四年間國際帝國主義者除日本以外都忙於自已打自已無暇顧及中國但是到了民國九年歐戰結束了帝國主義在精疲力盡經濟枯窘的時候他們便盡量地侵略中國想在中國補償他們歐戰時一切的損失因此他們的侵略壓迫比以前兇狠過十百倍中山先生目擊這種危險的局面知道要抵抗列强反抗帝國主義者的壓迫非有堅固綂一的强有力的政府不可但那時北洋軍閥正氣燄萬丈想呌軍閥去反抗列强無異與虎謀皮絶對没有辦法的南方還比較有點希望因此中山先生就决定想把廣東做革命的根據地於是派朱先生到廣州去聯絡民圑組織民衆想把廣州的桂系軍閥驅逐於是朱先生就死於軍閥的毒手所以朱先生的死是爲挽救國家的淪亡的死爲拯救民族的危殆而死爲解除民衆的痛苦而死簡而言之朱先生是爲公而死所以朱先生的死與平常人的死之不同眞有天壤之别現在國民黨的勢力已普遍全國國民黨黨員的數量也比以前增多但是像朱先生般爲公而生爲公而死的人能有多少就拿上海而論邑上海的同志能像朱先生爲公而奮鬥爲公而犧牲的能有多少上海是受帝國主義壓迫侵略最明顯的地方但是我們試問上海的民衆是不是個個都明白都氣慣都預備和帝國主義者奮鬥犧牲即使明瞭帝國主義者的壓迫而有决心和帝國主義者作殊死之戰的又能有多少我們拿抵制洋貨而論能有多少民衆堅决地永遠地綿延他們抵制的决心這種民族意識的淡薄民族精神的淪亡他的原因就是大家祗知道私不知道公談起國事便有許多人批評當局怎樣的不對怎樣的錯誤假定請他帮政府的忙出一點力他便敬謝不敏溜之大吉順民救國非我事自有周公孔聖人這兩句詩形容我國人民對於國事之態度可謂確當之至這就是表明國人祗會咒駡唱高調而不會實際努力去做的明證這個原因就是大家祗知道私不知道公國内的災荒如是嚴重災民嗷嗷待哺的苦况决非我們說話所可形容的但是有錢的人寗願吃花酒看電影到賭博塲逛跳舞廳以及其他種種聲色貨利的事情要是要他捐錢救濟災民他阿願拔一毛而利天下的這就是祗知私不知道公的表顯上海每天要死掉多少人有許多有錢的富翁爲盜匪擊斃有許多盜匪爲盜案而死有許多爲偷女人不遂而自殺以及其他許許多多爲聲色貨利與功名富貴而死這許多人的死我們非但不給他絲毫同情絲毫惋惜反而我們加以痛斥咒駡這原因就是因爲他們是爲私而死並不是爲公而死所以今天我們紀念朱先生的殉國第一我們應該效法朱先生爲公而死的精神現在民國十九年距離朱先生殉國的民國九年已整整十年了現在的情形是不是比以前好些呢帝國主義的壓迫比以前更利害反動派的騷擾還是不絶的滋擾國民政府的基礎還是非常脆弱中華民國的國基還是非常動搖苦難時代的中國正猶要像朱先生般爲國爲民的人爲公而生爲公而死的人我們眞感覺得異常悲痛異常空虚現在我們黨裡像朱先生般爲公的人能有多少我們在害怕震恐之餘應如何效法朱先主和精神人格事業以完成朱先生未竟之志呢倘使大家還是祗知道私爲私而生爲私而死國家民族固然無辦法爲私人謀福利之徒亦將同樣限於覆滅的命運因爲中國正需要像朱先生般專爲公的人所以就把這一點貢獻給各位完了</p>

<h3>時代青年</h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>第六期　大光書店出版</p>
<p>今日中國的出版界大都呈顯着惡劣不堪的現象　趨於營業底商品化對於世界眞正有價值底學術的介紹中國文學底發揚簡直是一點也不顧及祗是爲着自已營業上的有否起色因此所出版的書籍專門側重於性的方面迎合一般流俗的心理低級的趣味在先前書肆裏充滿了畸形的變態的文藝書在最近又出版了許多所謂政治的社會的科學書都是足以迷醉一般有爲的青年走上歧路意識着正確的思想這不但是中國出版的危機亦是中國青年最大之危機要在最短期間突破了這危機却非從現代一般青年學子所時常接近的出版物上着手改進不可這是最顯明的事實</p>
<p>在最近有中心思想的提倡民族主義文藝的學者已積極的注意到這一點原來我們要曉得現代一般正在求學的青年即是未來中華國的棟樑所以我們也可以說中華民族的興衰則視這般青年的努力如何然而青年人的意志大都屬於薄弱的一類近朱者赤近墨者黑語已成了極其普通的現象如果要補足這種意志上與行爲上的缺陷當然須在出版物上着力因爲在學的一般青年不管他對於書籍有否異樣的嗜好但至少總要在閒餘時間之内撈一些出版物藉以消遣有時提起筆來寫幾句風清月白的濫調這也是影響於所謂畸形的變態的文藝作品其它如社會科學等等使青年們所受的毒也是同樣而且祗力求自已營業上發逹的書肆對於青年們解决自身問題的書籍竟一點也不加以注意即使有些向上的青年欲閱讀關於這類的書籍亦無從購買祗有走向畸形的道路上力求文字慾望的滿足這委實是令人惋惜的事直到最近的不久始有指示現代青年的中心刋物出世首先活躍於我們眼前的便是我現在要虔誠的推薦於讀者青年們之前時代青年周刋它已出版六期内容非常充實而豐富給予我們不少底正確的指示已成爲現代中國一般青年們必讀的良好刋物</p>
<p>這期的内容更形精采有勞的中俄會的沈寂後生的青年領袖的没落大樁的今後學校戲運動的出路出新的上海一名人金光楣的密誓每一篇都是我們必讀的精心之作現分别簡述於下</p>
<p>中俄會議的沈寂作者將全文劃分爲四段在第一段引言裏便將有關於我國國際地位關係的所謂中俄正式會議用很扼要的手腕叙說了一個梗概同時提及到俄方是在虐殺異國民族我中華同胞使一般昏潰的青年能夠明瞭赤色的恐佈第二段是寫會議的起因詳叙事情不啻閱讀長時期之報紙因爲一件極其重要的事件發生最先須要明白了一因然後再來考察果之成敗作者勞君當然是長於論著所以很敏捷地注意到這一點第三段是叙述中俄會議最近情勢將蘇俄種種侵略的野心暴露無餘根據正確的事實加以詳論使我們明瞭中俄會議最近究竟是趨於什麽一種形勢第四段結言當然是總結以上所論但作者爲了促醒一般青年整個的爲此重大的事件奮起起見故最後有這樣的警語但青年們我們應將我們周身的熱血起來奮鬥爲民族爭光爲莫氏後盾誓與蘇俄作最後之一搏以期獲得我民族永久獨立的光榮</p>
<p>綜合藝術的戲劇在思想界混亂不堪的中國也急須提倡回時將過去一些關係此項不正確的内容與理論更須加以探討或糾正因爲戲劇在實質上是包括了聽覺與視覺所以它底收效在藝術的範疇上比較其它底來得廣些容易吸收一般觀衆尤其是現今在學的青年對於戲劇具有濃烈的愛好的興趣但是都畸形地去求欲望的滿足在學校的同樂會中所表現的也不過現今仍流行於普通社會中的歌舞劇這種戲劇的演出實對於中國青年祗有害而無益就是以青年讀物爲號召的中國學生也曾出過一本學校戲劇運動專號但是其中所論與及介紹的戲劇大都不是合乎一般青年本身的要求同時還灌輸青年以不正確的思想這實不是提倡戲劇底忠誠的態度由此看來學校戲劇的提倡與鼓吹是目前不可遲緩的事了大樁君這篇今後學校戲劇運動的出路一文委實值得我們底注意他將舊戲劇的病態過去戲劇理論的錯誤愛美劇底不振在其中對於學校劇底意義與出路都有詳盡的發揮與指示如</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>戲劇在文藝上是站的頂重要的地位目前文藝上鑒於時代的要求確立了民族主義的文藝理論以求民族的生存與進化這是應該的當這樣一個丁於苦難的時代一方面受異族的侵凌壓迫而在自身的民族意識又如是消沉勢必借助於文藝的力量以推助政治上的民族主義運動的完成現在我們的學校戲劇即是以青年爲唯一的對象今後青年的使命便是要担負民族國家的責任企圖這衰老凋疲的民族恢復固有的青春的生命同時生命力的原素孕育充實而希冀興盛的發皇那末學校戲劇所應該要負的使命必然只有促進他們對於民族觀念和意識的堅强一致爲民族生存而奮鬥</p>
<p>這是多麽痛切而精密之語給予青年們多量正確的指示同時一般思想謬誤的提倡學校劇的學者也應該快快地醒覺過來不要以什麽毒來麻醉有爲的青年至少讀了大樁君這文而後始</p>
<p>光楣君的密誓是一篇寓意深沉的短篇小說他是描寫張氏夫婦看了卓别麟主演的侮辱我們中華民族的影片所意識着的種種印象而如銀幕眞正在表演般的描寫下來種種侮辱我們中華民族之處非常緊張而有力使讀者不期然而然的要跳躍起來這樣的文藝作品在目前是非常需要光楣君竟能先我們注意到這一點實值得異外的欽佩最後的綂稱是這樣的緊凑而有力顯然地表現出作者描寫創作的特長來</p>
<p>這一夜他俩都是心潮起伏再也睡不着他俩很興奮地高歌慷慨他俩澈底地覺悟了於是他俩並肩對窗口立着他舉起右手她舉起左手向天空立誓我張執文我許佩貞從此願犧牲奮鬥獻身給我們的中華民族最後他俩同聲高呼着</p>
<p>這的確是一篇不易多得的具有中心思想的創作在小小的時代青年周刋上竟能與我們相見委實值得鼓掌而欣喜很希望青年們必讀的時代青年上常有這樣的美與力的創作刋於巨大的論著之後使我們啖了酸味的青果又嘗到美味的口香糖是多麽的爽口我最後要愼重說一句</p>
<p>時代青年是中國青年們必讀的刋物</p>

<h3>青龍橋上</h3>
<p>— 問鵑</p>
<p>金風破天來落實取其材學校的師生們也都趁此時期旅行到山巓水涯去採集她們的的標本我們一行人便商議青龍橋去因爲那邊是京綏路的最高處長城之陰當有不少的花草和昆蟲可以尋取在一個碧天如洗的星期日早上我們便出發了從宣化到青龍橋一路的火車上高揷著省立第某某中學的大旗迎風飄展好像替我們做開路先鋒似的經過好幾個山洞遙望長城如鍊鎖著這偉大莊嚴的八逹嶺山崗便已赫然呈顯在我們的眼前了同學們濟濟蹌嗆地下了車各自背著她們的標本箱提著食盒有的空著手只把照相機在肩上一套或是挾著日記簿迤邐出了車站循路向長城走去</p>
<p>中途遇著不少的外國太太她們提心吊膽地坐在竹椅子裏被兩個轎夫抬著上去和抬著下來我見她們對於我們這班不怕石徑迢遙的活潑跳踉的女學生們都露著驚詫的顏色或者以爲是可羡慕新中國女子還是以爲不配坐轎子的賤女孩呢無論她們是詛咒也好讚嘆也好總之是不關我們的事這二三十個不怕艱難險阻的我們早已是攀登極頂立在城垜子上高唱著旅行歌了</p>
<p>馨提倡做深呼吸大家附和著一時笑語聲頓寂只有輕輕的手臂轉動聲在西風裏向四圍飄散</p>
<p>我採到一支金鐘草</p>
<p>我看見一棵野人血</p>
<p>咦這裏有一隻玉蟲</p>
<p>不要吵把我的三色蝴蝶嚇走了</p>
<p>這些低語聲充塞在靜止的長城坳裏好像夢中聽到的音樂飄忽而又神秘我却不去動作只出神地望著這些蒼巒重壘的山頭和渺小如衣帶的河水水流織著山麓鐵路又織著河岸而不知綿互到多少遠的一抹青山又被白色的長城糾繞著似乎直到天盡頭方才完結白雲刷在空際如鳳尾倒掛秋天的景色本來已夠清麗了而况又在這樣的境界之中</p>
<p>你痴了嗎青用力把我的裙角一拉原來她正在地上坐著挖一棵草的根這是一種菊科植物俗名呌火拉拉的在北方很不容易找到所以青還這樣努力我見她也不用鏟子却把十個指頭當做器械已經快把主根挖出來了滿手的爛泥也不知道髒</p>
<p>爲什麽不用小刀呢</p>
<p>嚇你知道什麽用了刀細根要切斷的</p>
<p>一時散佈在各處的同學們都回來了</p>
<p>剛才是滿坑滿谷現在是滿載而歸轟然一聲大家都笑了於是席地坐下拿出帶來的食盒擺在一塊石頭上預備吃喝衆人都紛忙著搶著來撕鷄腿</p>
<p>這一羣逃荒的總有三年不曾吃過飯了吧</p>
<p>不知誰說了這一句却先抓了四個饅頭走開去吃去了一霎時風捲殘雲十五六個食盒和幾籃子饅頭早已空了我覺得自會吃飯以來從不曾像這天那樣好吃的山上空氣好是增進食慾的一個原因吧</p>
<p>淡淡的太陽照著人們飽食之後的疲倦的臉上似乎都有些倦意了張先生穿著黄色的騎馬裝手捧一個小木箱也從遠過的山頭趕過來了她的臉流著熱汗氣咻咻地好像一隻山羊剛被老虎追著那樣嘴裏喊道</p>
<p>了不得了不得你們快去看去</p>
<p>我們被她這樣一喊睡魔早已消散也都提起精神聽她的報告她把箱子放下揩乾了滿面的汗方慢慢的說</p>
<p>那邊有一隻大狼在洞裏伏著呢</p>
<p>大家都要充好漢爭著說我先去連到一個素來不敢踏死一隻蟑螂的蘋也說不怕結果是十人爲一隊共總得了兩隊半張先生爲隊長一路浩浩蕩蕩直奔山背後而去各人抖擻精神帶著應戰的方式把照相架當作衝鋒的武器枕頭箱作爲襲擊的工具却對準了張先生所指示的地方望著</p>
<p>只聽見一聲長嘷頓時間山鳴谷應滿林黄葉蕭蕭也隨風飄墮瑟瑟作怪響蘋是掣牢我的衣裳身子蹲下大半截去了也有後退的也有借著埋伏而暗自藏好的</p>
<p>在陷阱裏在網裏</p>
<p>不知誰先發現了而且喊著於是大家的勇氣又一齊恢復了藏在别處的也走出來了探頭探腦地看看這隻已經被捉了的黄狼究竟是否還能走出來吃人幸而一個獵户早已從樹背後跳出把這只鐵絲籠的蓋子上了鎖並且背起來像要回家去的樣子張先生問他要了兩枚狼牙獵户答應等一會就送來便帶著他的勝利品欣欣然下山去了</p>
<p>我們也嘆一口氣彷彿這塲勝利自已也與有微勞似的</p>
<h3>母子</h3>
<p>— 蘇讀餘攝</p>
<p>開始又去搜求目的物希望著能否也這樣的幸運讓我們安安穩穩地得到點什麽才好各色各種的野草塞滿了各人的箱子飛的爬的蟲豸都嬾洋洋地躺在玻璃蓋著的匣子裏</p>
<p>今天的收獲總算還好祗是張先生的狼牙似乎得的太容易一點</p>
<p>我想在重上歸途的時候太陽已經隱去了面目只留下她的臨去秋波在蒼翠的山頭微微地向著人間一瞬我們踏在這斜陽古道的上邊回視巍然獨立的萬里長城像巨靈的影子一樣消失在蒼茫的暮靄裏</p>

<h3>More Beloved Than Relatives and Friends: (Revere) Our Customers</h3>
<p>There's a saying that customers are the bread and butter of shop employees. I dare say, the livelihood of most shop employees depends on the customers. So, it is appropriate to say that the affection for customers surpasses that for relatives and friends.  Every customer has their own unique circumstances when they come to the shop, and dealing with them is no easy task.</p>
<p>Some are impatient, some are slow, some are simple, some stutter. If you work in a thriving company, the business is naturally busy. When customers are numerous and you are overwhelmed, you may inevitably become tired and annoyed. Once annoyed and irritated, you will offend customers. Customers originally want to be close to you, but you refuse to be close to them. I wonder if that is the original intention of the company. Young shop friends, let me tell you, in the midst of your hard work and busyness, if you can handle guests and customers from all directions, and be accommodating in every way, quickly attending to the impatient, patiently listening to the slow, and treating the simple and stuttering the same, if you are polite, informative, and thoroughly explain everything all day long, then this is your greatest skill, and your future will surely be promising.</p>

<h3>The Northeast Army Marches into Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Arrived in Langfang and Fengtai Yesterday; Enters Beiping City This Morning</p>
<p>After the Jin Army Withdrew from Tianjin, Dong Yingbin's Brigade Took Over</p>
<p>A Northeast Army armored train arrived in Tianjin at 7:00 AM on the 21st. The first train headed to Yangcun and Langfang at 10:00 AM, and the second train headed to Jinghai and Machang. At 7:30 AM, the 5th Brigade Commander Dong Yingbin arrived. Mayor Cui and Bureau Chief Zeng and others went to the station to welcome him. Dong told reporters that his entire brigade had arrived in Tianjin but would not disembark. Tonight or tomorrow morning, two regiments will be dispatched to Tianjin-Pukou Railway to fill the defense. The 27th Brigade, led by Liu Naichang, arrived in Lutai at 1:00 PM on the 21st and may arrive in Beiping on the 22nd to take over defense. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Fu Baoheng, Deputy Director of the Beining Railway Bureau in Tianjin, hosted a banquet for Brigade Commander Ge at the Railway Bureau on the afternoon of the 21st, inviting Chief of Staff Zhu of the Garrison Headquarters to attend. At 9:00 AM, Yuan Qingzeng sent personnel to the Railway Bureau to requisition 11 train cars to transport troops. The Railway Bureau had no cars available, resulting in a conflict. As a result, they barely managed to find two trains. Yuan and Brigade Commander Dong discussed and decided not to disembark for the time being, waiting for the complete withdrawal of the Jin Army before taking over the defense, which would likely take two days before the military organs could take over. (21st Special Telegram) In Tianjin, a reporter visited Liu Qiwen, Chief of Staff of the 5th Brigade, on the afternoon of the 21st. According to him, the brigade's supplies were self-provided and would not be supplied by the local government. Wang Shuchang's Second Army is also mobilizing. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Posters welcoming the Northeast Army and Director Zhang have been posted all over the streets and stations of Tianjin, and the city is very stable. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Due to the arrival of the Northeast Army in Tianjin, the Japanese army stationed in Tianjin sent armed soldiers to guard the intersections of the Sino-Japanese border on the morning of the 21st. Seeing that the Northeast Army had not disembarked and the area was peaceful, they lifted the state of alert in the afternoon. (21st Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Yuan Qingzeng's illness has lessened, and he went to the Garrison Headquarters and Military Police Headquarters on the 21st to work despite his illness. (21st Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Fluctuations in World Morale</h3>
<p>After the end of the European War, the people of the world, in light of the magnitude of the losses, loathed war and were diligent in eliminating the possibility of a second world war. For several years, partly due to the exhaustion of various nations, which necessitated a temporary respite, and partly due to this anti-war sentiment, and the calls for peace from the majority of people, it was possible to rest under a relatively peaceful atmosphere. As of today, with the period of rest having lasted somewhat longer, the fluctuation of people's morale has resurfaced as a result. According to the words of a Chicago congressman who toured Europe and returned to the United States, there is a fear that a second world war will soon occur, because the recent war preparations competition among European countries has far exceeded that of the time of the European War in 1912, and the international suspicion is also more intense than before the European War. The recent large-scale army maneuvers of France on the Italian border, and the naval maneuvers near Toulon, actually contain the intention of countering the military ambitions of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The recent German elections are also a sign of amending the Treaty of Versailles, and so on. His observations of the situation in Europe are very worrying.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the White Russian newspaper reported that Soviet Russian People's Commissar Lunacharsky, in a conversation with American journalists, said that today's arms reduction treaties of the great powers are merely deceiving the world, and the arms race continues unabated in various countries. Soviet Russia is forced to have the Red Army as well. Lunacharsky also said that Poland's policies are still emotionally driven. Although Soviet Russia currently has no intention of attacking Poland, if Poland wants to fight against Soviet Russia, the Red Army will immediately strike hard. If Romania unites with the Polish army, the Red Army will not hesitate to fight them as well. His words are indeed aggressive.</p>

<h3>Negotiations on Sino-British-French Jurisdictional Rights</h3>
<p>The answer regarding jurisdictional rights presented by the British envoy in Nanjing this time still insists on the already established agreement of gradually relinquishing them, which clearly contradicts our country's New Year's Day declaration to abolish consular jurisdiction. The Central Political Council has already ordered Wang Zhengting to verbally reject it and is studying a counter-proposal. Besides telegraphing London for instructions, the British envoy also plans to take a ship to Shanghai on the 23rd to await the reply before discussing the matter further with Foreign Minister Wang. (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-British jurisdictional rights issue in Nanjing, the contents of the British side's proposed answer this time are as follows: 1. Regarding civil cases, they agree that Chinese courts can handle them, but if the country's envoys and consuls believe that a certain case has been judged unfairly, they can request its withdrawal. 2. Criminal cases must retain extraterritoriality for five years. 3. Within areas of 30 or 50 *li* around Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, extraterritoriality must be retained. The central authorities consider the above three points to be unreasonable demands and have decided not to use this answer as a basis for discussion. (Special dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<h3>An Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Will Be Held After the End of the War</p>
<p>The central authorities in Nanjing consider economic issues to be extremely important. Previously, they had no time to discuss them due to military affairs. Now that the military situation in the North is about to end, they should be studied as soon as possible. They plan to convene a national economic conference immediately after the end of the war. The scope of discussion will roughly be divided into: 1. The consolidation of domestic and foreign debts; 2. Methods for unifying the currency; 3. Measures for developing industry and commerce; 4. The consolidation of the financial system, and several other aspects. It is also planned that the central government will issue a general order to all relevant agencies before the meeting to formulate opinions on economic matters.

<h3>Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Selling Agricultural Products at Reduced Prices</p>
<p>Intended to Disrupt the World Market</p>
<p>Bread Shortage Still Raging in Northern Russia</p>
<p>A report from London says that recently, due to the nationwide shortage of cash, the Soviet Russian government has had to rush all of its bulk barley exports out of the country to obtain funds for relief. This has caused the price of barley to plummet to 30 shillings and 3 pence, the lowest price since 1910. On the 14th and 15th of this month, the Soviet Russian government specially chartered more than 30 steamships here to go to various Russian ports in the Black Sea area to transport wheat, which is expected to be insufficient. If Soviet Russian exports do not stop, the price of wheat will fall further, and the barley market may be completely overthrown. British newspapers have unanimously protested against this, saying that British farmers are about to go bankrupt and that the government should not sit idly by. However, although the wheat-producing areas in southern Russia are constantly exporting their agricultural products, there is still a very serious bread shortage in northern Russia because the government urgently needs a large amount of cash to save its precarious economic difficulties and cannot take care of the dying people in the north. (World)</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Chicago, 20th: The Minister of Agriculture announced that Soviet Russian commercial organizations have recently been selling wheat short here, intending to lower the price, which is harmful to American farmers.</p>
<p>Associated Press, Chicago, 20th: The Director of the Bureau of Commerce today promised the public that he would thoroughly investigate the allegations of Soviet Russia disrupting the Chicago food market by selling food at reduced prices and proposed that the Minister of Agriculture and the State Council first consider whether Soviet Russia has the right to sell goods in the American market.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, London, 20th: The Morning Post reported that the situation of Soviet Russia disrupting the British market with cheap goods is becoming increasingly serious. The goods that Soviet Russia intends to sell in the UK may be agricultural or industrial products, but grain is essential to Soviet Russia, so it threatens the harbor workers of that country, saying that those who reveal the exported goods to others will be sentenced to death. Now, in addition to wheat, Soviet Russia is using this method to import candies, cloth, saltpeter, and other goods into the UK.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Geneva, 20th: At a meeting of the League of Nations Economic Committee, the Bulgarian representative strongly opposed Soviet Russia's selling agricultural products to other countries at reduced prices, saying that it was harmful to other countries and that this policy might be extended to industrial products as well.</p>
<h3>Polish-Lithuanian Border Dispute</h3>
<p>The Holy See Strives to Mediate</p>
<p>The Long-Standing Case Is Resolved</p>
<p>National News Agency, Kovno, 20th: According to reliable sources, an agreement has been negotiated on the long-standing Vilnius issue between Poland and Lithuania. Poland will be able to obtain most of the area and its capital. However, the proposed new border will be drawn from the suburbs. In addition, Poland has made other concessions as a revived nation in exchange for the convenience of a naval base. Since Polish General Żeligowski led mercenary troops to invade and occupy the capital in October 1920, the area has become a highly disputed issue between the two countries. Even the League of Nations has not dared to deal with it lightly. This time, thanks to the mediation efforts of the Holy See, the two sides reopened negotiations and reached an agreement. The Polish representative is the brother of the current Prime Minister Piłsudski. However, this agreement has not yet been confirmed by the officialdom.</p>
<h3>Storm on the West Coast of Europe</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: Since last night, a strong southwest wind has been blowing in the UK, with a wind speed of 61 miles per hour. Today, the wind is even stronger, with waves rising and a wind speed of 70 miles per hour in some places and 80 miles per hour in others. Ships dare not sail. The Imperial Airways Company's flying boat came against the wind and progressed extremely slowly, but finally arrived at the Lymm flight field. All places have suffered material losses, but fortunately, they are not significant. There were freight train collisions near Liddington because the wind and rain were too heavy to see far. Although no one was injured, traffic was suspended for several hours. Crops have been slightly damaged, and the storm is expected to continue.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Madrid, 20th: A strong storm is raging on the northern coast of Spain, and most fishing boats are feared to have capsized.</p>
<h3>Stability of the German Political Situation</h3>
<p>Extremists Have No Possibility of Plotting a Coup</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 20th: Recently, rumors have spread at home and abroad that the extremist elements in the National Socialist Party are plotting a coup, causing the price of German securities to plummet in the international market. Today, the federal and Prussian governments have vigorously denied the rumors. Prime Minister Brüning solemnly declared to reporters that the political situation is stable as usual and that there is absolutely no reason to be uneasy. The authorities are closely monitoring the extremists, but so far, there has been no report of preparations for a revolution. Even if there were, it would be nipped in the bud because the strength of the national army today can easily control the situation. In addition, all left-wing newspapers except the Communist Party newspapers have stated that although the National Socialist Party has won a great victory in the elections, any attempt to carry out a coup-like action to overthrow the current administrative system will inevitably lead to great disappointment.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 20th: The Communist Party announced today that at the opening of the new parliament, the party intends to submit a resolution demanding the suspension of the continued payment of installments under the Young Plan because Germany has now reached a state where it can no longer cope with any obligations. Political circles say that this motion is merely a scare tactic and has no real power to speak of because the majority of members of parliament are of course unwilling to take this risky action.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Copenhagen, 20th: Since the election, a large amount of German capital has flowed into Denmark, most of which has flowed into the border provinces of Schleswig and Holstein to purchase land.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Berlin, 20th: There are a total of 39 female members of parliament in the new House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>World</h3>
<p>Brewing a Second World War</p>
<p>Chicago Congressman Makes Alarmist Remarks</p>
<p>Women's Representatives Petition the League of Nations</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 20th: Chicago Congressman Bretton returned today from his summer vacation in Europe and told people that his greatest concern recently is that there will be a second World War before long. The arms race between European countries has far exceeded that of 1912, and international distrust is also more intense than in the two years before the Great War. France's recent show of force in the Isole d'Hyères and its naval exercises near Toulon actually contain the intention of dealing with Mussolini's ambitions. The recent election in Germany is also a prelude to the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. Considering the above, it is enough to predict that the international explosion will inevitably materialize sooner or later, and most countries in Europe may be engulfed in the vortex of war.</p>
<p>Pacific News Agency, Geneva, 20th: Several women's associations have recently sent representatives to the League of Nations General Assembly to submit a petition stating, "We, representing more than 40 million women, hereby call on the League of Nations General Assembly to pay attention to the terrible trend of newspapers, the public, and government agencies being unwilling to discuss or even allowing discussion of the possibility of war. This trend is becoming increasingly serious and is contrary to the Pact of Paris signed by 57 civilized nations and is a stain on the reputation of those who signed the Pact of Paris. The danger it poses to young people and to all mankind is intolerable."</p>

<p>"It is indeed intolerable. We hereby declare that maintaining peace is the most urgent task for all mankind. You are political figures and representatives of the people.

<h3>President of the Bombay Struggle Administration Committee Arrested</h3>
<p>Mrs. Baiconda Arrested</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 24th: Mrs. Baiconda succeeded Mrs. Mehertai as President of the Bombay Struggle Administrative Committee of the Indian National Congress just half a month ago and has now been arrested.</p>
<h3>Japan's National Defense Supplement Plan</h3>
<p>The Navy and the Ministry of Finance Have Differing Opinions</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 21st: The Navy's supplementary plan is to supplement the deficiencies and expand the air force at the same time, but the Ministry of Finance argues that the deficiencies in military strength arising from the treaty can only be supplemented by auxiliary ships. The expansion of the air force has nothing to do with the treaty, so it cannot recognize the Navy's plan, which regards the expansion of the air force as an inextricable part of the treaty's military strength. Finance Minister Inoue also intends to include the expansion of the air force in the construction of artificial ships and the expenses for content preparation, and strive for savings to obtain tax reduction revenue. However, because the Privy Council has its own views on supplementing the treaty's military strength and Prime Minister Hamaguchi has answered in the Privy Council Committee, everything must be decided by the cabinet. The Navy and the Ministry of Finance have different opinions on supplementing the deficiencies, which is a major hidden reef between the two ministries, and the government will again feel thorny.</p>
<h3>Scheduled Air Service Between England and South Africa</h3>
<p>Business to Start in January Next Year</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th: Arrangements for the Imperial Airways Company's air traffic business between London and Cape Town in South Africa have now been approved by the governments concerned. The London to Lake Victoria route will start business in January next year. After a few months, it will be extended to Cape Town.</p>
<h3>The Balkans Plans to Adopt a New Flag</h3>

<p>National News Agency, Athens, 20th: The Preparatory Committee of the Balkan Congress has agreed on a new Balkan flag, including the colors of the national flags of the Balkan countries, with six stars added to a white background. This is probably the most colorful flag in the world.</p>
<h3>New Motorbike Record</h3>
<p>Created by a German, Schuni</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 20th: Today, German Schuni rode a two-wheeled motorbike and traveled one mile in 26.38 seconds, averaging 219.618 kilometers per hour. This is the absolute world record. The previous record set by Englishman Wright was 218.18 miles per hour.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Briand's Assassination</h3>
<p>Townspeople Are Like Grass and Trees, Startled at the Slightest Sound</p>
<p>Ending in a False Alarm</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 20th: A small town in France, only a hundred miles from Paris, suddenly spread the rumor that Foreign Minister Briand was assassinated by an Italian thug in Geneva. Troops from a neighboring town even marched through the town, and the people were in a panic. It was falsely rumored that the government had ordered mobilization, and the local authorities rashly ordered the church to ring the bell to gather the masses. As a result, the whole town was in turmoil, and women and children cried, trying to prevent the conscription of young men within their reserve military service period. It was not until several hours later that a telephone call from Paris to the town revealed that it was purely a false alarm, and the disturbance subsided. Although this incident is foolish and ridiculous, it is enough to show the restlessness of the people's hearts in France and throughout Europe at the moment.</p>
<h3>Important Domestic News</h3>
<p>The Central Government Holds a</p>
<p>Commemoration for the Tenth Anniversary of Zhu Zhixin's Martyrdom</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 21st, the Central Party Headquarters held a commemoration for the tenth anniversary of Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom in the auditorium. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Gu Yingfen, Wang Zhengting, Chen Bulei, Li Wenfan, Ke Xing'e, and Miao Peicheng, among others, and representatives from various agencies, totaling about three or four hundred people, attended. Hu Hanmin presided over the ceremony. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that Mr. Zhu Zhixin had a long history in the National Revolution. During the war to protect the constitution, when the Gui rebels occupied Guangdong, Mr. Zhu Zhixin traveled between Hong Kong and Shanghai to negotiate military affairs with great effort. Unfortunately, he was killed in Humen in 1920. Looking back on Mr. Zhu's great life, what the comrades of our party should emulate is: 1. He had special intelligence and could read several lines at a glance. After a little research on Chinese and foreign studies, he had his own insights. His writings were extremely profound and exquisite, and he could write ten thousand words in a single sitting, as if he had prepared them in advance. His diligent pursuit of knowledge, frugality, and steadfastness were especially beyond what ordinary people could achieve. 2. As a scholarly general, he led more than 100,000 troops and made decisive decisions when things happened. He was brave based on righteousness to be loyal to his beliefs, and his outlook on life was extremely indifferent, without considering personal interests or asking about power and glory. He once did not hesitate to demote himself to the position of accounting director to clean up Guangdong's finances. 3. He had a well-trained spirit, and although he often faced life and death, his courage was extraordinary. He never wavered. He had a great deal of research on military affairs, and his article "The Psychology of Soldiers and Its Transformation" was praised by Chiang Kai-shek. All of the above are manifestations of Mr. Zhu's great spirit throughout his life. We should emulate the martyrs to be worthy of the meaning of the commemoration. Chen Bulei then delivered a speech saying that he deeply admired Mr. Zhu's personality, learning, writing, and strategy, and at the same time, he felt that our comrades should especially emulate his integrity and magnanimity in believing in Mr. Zhu. Now that China is in such a difficult situation, young people's thoughts are so complicated, and society is becoming increasingly precarious, all because people in general have lost their cultivation in integrity and magnanimity. In the future, we should actively promote morality and pay attention to cultivation in order to correct social evils. The meeting adjourned after the speech.</p>
<h3>Hunan-Jiangxi Troops Surround and Suppress the Communist Bandits</h3>
<p>Hunan Army's Four Divisions Pursue in Two Routes</p>
<p>He Jian Cables Situation of Bandits' Flight</p>
<p>Changsha Communication: After the failure of the Communist bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, Lin (Biao), Kong (Hechong), Li (Shixing), etc. to invade the province with all their forces, they initially planned to flee to Jiangxi via Liling to attack Ji'an. If they could not enter Jiangxi, they would directly take Xiangnan via Caiyou. However, Peng and Huang had differing opinions with Zhu and Mao. Peng and Huang believed that gathering in one place would risk encirclement by the National Army. They advocated dividing into smaller groups to harass Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, thereby dispersing the National Army's forces and preventing them from concentrating on suppression. They also wanted Zhu, Mao, etc. to carry out their initial plan to flee to Jiangxi, while Peng, Huang, etc. would temporarily return to their old nests in Liuping to seize opportunities to harass Hunan and Hubei again. Zhu and Mao initially opposed, but Peng and Huang had greater influence and the ability to sway the Communist bandits. Since Peng and Huang insisted, they finally implemented their plan. Currently, the majority of Zhu and Mao's forces have crossed Liling and are advancing rapidly towards Pingxiang. The majority of Peng and Huang's forces have retreated to Liuyang County and are building defensive works at Jiaoxi Ridge in an attempt to resist stubbornly. He Jian has now assigned four divisions, divided into two routes, to pursue. On the Jiangxi front, when the Communist bandits made their general retreat on the 13th and 14th, He Jian immediately telegraphed Lu Dipin, requesting him to send troops to block them as soon as possible. Yesterday, he received Lu's reply, stating that he had already ordered Zhang Huizan's division to leave Pingxiang and block Zhu and Mao towards Liling, and Tan Daoyuan's division to leave Wanzai and block Peng and Huang towards Liuyang. Thus, the Communist bandits are now trapped in an encirclement by the armies of Hunan and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<p>The situation of the Communist bandits' retreat, according to aerial reconnaissance reports, is as follows: On the 18th, at 7:00 AM, squadron leader Zhang Yuheng and navigator Yang Xialin, aboard Dallas No. 1 aircraft, inspected the situation in Liling, You County, Anren, and the suburbs of the provincial capital. (A) On the right flank: 1. On the railway in Wulipai, west of Liling, there were about 1,000 bandits with guns. Three heavy bombs were dropped and 100 machine gun rounds were fired, killing many bandits. On the northern bank of the iron bridge to the east, there were hundreds of bandits with spears marching towards Liling. To the south, the figures in Sifen were chaotic, making it difficult to distinguish between civilians and bandits. In Youtangpu, bordering Pingxiang to the east, and on the small roads on both sides of the shop, there were scattered bandits advancing towards Pingxiang. 2. Luko is still occupied by bandits, with more than 40 large civilian boats and more than 10 rafts moored on the riverbank. On the small road east of the city, there were scattered bandits marching towards the city. 3. There were no traces of bandits in You County, Anren, Zhuzhou, Shiwan, Zhaoling, and Zhuting. However, there were scattered groups of three to five bandits marching towards Luko on the small paths in Zhuzhou. 4. In Huangtuling, You County, there were about 40,000 bandits with spears gathered in one place. A speaking platform was erected there, seemingly for a meeting. The aircraft descended and fired 300 machine gun rounds, seeing the bandits fleeing in panic and disorder, with corpses strewn along the way. (B) On the left flank: 1. There were about 400 bandits with guns between Jintang and Dadu, marching towards Zhentou Town. Three bombs were dropped. There were no traces of bandits east of Zhentou Town. However, there were many people in Pujishi, seemingly bandits hiding. Four bombs were dropped, killing countless people. 2. The government troops stationed in Dongshan and Langlishi are advancing towards Yongan City and Jiaoxi Ridge. Yesterday, He Jian telegraphed all armies and county militias to strictly guard against the Communist bandits. The record is as follows: (Titles omitted) The bandits Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, etc., after their repeated general offensive on Changsha from Zhengwan, fiercely attacked our army with tens of thousands of troops. They fell forward and followed each other twice, but were finally overwhelmed by our firepower, and their deaths were countless. Yesterday morning, they were bombed by our artillery and aircraft, making them even more unable to support themselves. Therefore, starting from Yuan morning, Zhu Mao's faction retreated towards Zhuli. Their vanguard arrived at Licheng on Hanshen, appearing to flee east to Pingxiang. Peng Huang's faction was still entrenched in Yijiawan and Tiaomajian on Hanri. They began moving east on Shan morning, appearing to be fleeing to Liuyang again. Our army is currently following and pursuing them. We will arrive at Jintuo, Gongsigang, Tiaomajian, and Tianxinqiao on Xianri. The provincial capital has entered a state of complete peace and tranquility. It is found that the retreat of the bandits this time is indeed due to excessive damage and internal discord, so their actions are extremely embarrassing. Now the Central Army has dispatched a large army on the way, and the Jiangxi army has also dispatched troops to attack from the east and west, and it is not difficult to annihilate them. However, the bandits' usual trick is to divide into smaller groups after defeat, or flee or lie dormant, in order to plot secret growth and potential harm. If no measures are taken to eliminate them, it will be a hidden danger in the future. Our local garrison militias have considerable strength. Since they know that they have suffered heavy losses, they should take this opportunity to calmly deploy, strictly defend and suppress, and investigate and arrest them, so that they will not flee into or hide in the territory, and eliminate future troubles forever. A telegram is urgently issued and investigated and acted upon. Commander He Jian. Qiaohai Printed (September 18th).</p>
<h3>Wuhan's Martial Law Remains Strict</h3>
<p>No Vessels Allowed on the River After 12 PM</p>
<p>Citywide Inspections Conducted at Random Times and Locations</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, in order to consolidate public security, will request the Wuhan Commander-in-Chief's headquarters to prohibit ships from traveling at night and to conduct inspections at random times, locations, and frequencies from the 22nd to prevent Communist bandits from hiding. After receiving the request, the Commander-in-Chief's headquarters, in addition to ordering Navy Commander Zeng Yiding to strictly enforce it, also ordered the Hankou Municipal Government to notify the consuls of various countries to inform foreign ships. The inspections will be directly handled by the Garrison Department, which has issued a notice to the public to avoid misunderstandings. The letter from the Municipal Government to the consuls in Hankou is as follows: Dear Sirs, We have recently received a telegram from the Acting Commander-in-Chief's headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, stating that Wuhan Garrison Commander Xia Douyin reported that the 22nd meeting of the Hankou Martial Law Commander, the commander of the 3rd Gendarmerie Regiment Ouyang Zhen, proposed that if friendly forces' troops arrive in Wuhan at night by ship, our garrison troops will easily cause misunderstandings by refusing to allow them to land. If they are allowed to pass, accidents may occur. What should be done? After full discussion, it was decided that since the three cities of Wuhan were placed under martial law by the order of the Ministry on August 1st, land and water traffic have been cut off after 12:00 PM. However, on the water surface, troop transport ships still forcibly enter the area after 12:00 PM, making it impossible to check or stop them. Now that the Communist bandits are rampant and rebellious, the river defense is as important as the land defense. A slight carelessness will lead to great disasters. In order to prevent traitors and avoid misunderstandings with friendly forces, the department has submitted a document to the Ministry, requesting the Ministry to order two warships to be stationed, one in the middle of the river at Baishazhou and one in the middle of the river at Chenjiaji. According to the land method, traffic will be completely cut off from 12:00 PM to 5:00 AM the next morning. During this time, if any troop transport ships enter the garrison area on the river, the warships will block them and report to the Ministry for instructions on whether to allow them to enter. The Ministry will then notify the department by telephone, and the department will notify the garrison troops and agencies by telephone. Otherwise, they will not be allowed to enter to ensure confidentiality and avoid misunderstandings. The record is on file. Is this appropriate? We hereby submit a document to Your Excellency for review, and we request your instructions to comply with it for the public convenience. In addition to ordering the department to notify the Water Police Bureau to send two small boats under the command of Commander Zeng Yiding and to order sailors to assist on the small boats, please also inform the consuls of various countries stationed in Hankou to notify the shipping companies of their respective countries not to allow their ships to enter the garrison area after 12:00 PM and before 5:00 AM the next morning. Apart from separating one</p>

<h3>Internal Division in Lu Xingbang's Forces</h3>
<p>Lu's Troops Withdraw from Yan, Jian, and Shao Prefectures</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Lu Xingbang took the initiative to retreat and shorten his defensive line because the provincial army was attacking from Yongchun, Shouning, and Fuzhou in three directions. Zhou Zhiqin's brigade was originally cooperating with Lu Xingbang and his brother Xingrong, but now he has pledged allegiance to the provincial government. Chen Rongbiao's regiment has a historical relationship with Lu's division. However, the Lu brothers, considering Chen's two surrenders to Wang Yongquan and Zhou Yinren leading the Northern Army to attack Fujian as a danger to their hearts, plotted to deal with him. On the one hand, they promoted Chen to the commander of the supplementary brigade to show restraint. On the other hand, they transferred one regiment of his troops to Dahu and one regiment to Gutian, secretly monitored by Lu Xingrong and Lu's regiment commander Qian Yuguang, in order to resolve Chen at an opportune time. Chen did not take it seriously, as the elite troops of Lu's forces were in his hands. However, Chen usually competed with Qian Yuguang in Gutian for compiling bandits and distributing salaries, with a disdain for everything. Qian could not bear it and believed that he had to remove Chen at the right opportunity. Recently, Lu Xingrong newly appointed his nephew Chen Guanlu as the magistrate of Gutian County. Qian then conspired with Chen to set up a banquet in Mingluntang on September 3rd, inviting Chen to drink. Ambush soldiers were placed on both sides, and he was arrested and killed after half a drink. When one regiment of Chen's troops stationed in Gu heard the news, they rioted and looted in the town and countryside. Qian's regiment was unable to stop them due to its weak strength, so they had to allow them to carry weapons up the mountain. When Lu Xingrong received Qian Yuguang's telegram about one regiment of Chen's troops in Dahu, he immediately sent a team to surround and disarm them. After a fierce battle for half a day, half of Chen's troops escaped.</p>
<p>Lu's forces have become weaker after this incident. In addition, they have been trapped in northern Fujian for a long time and are experiencing extreme difficulties in supply. Knowing that prolonged stalemate is not a good solution, Lu Xingbang and Lu Xingrong retreated on their own and handed over their troops to Lu Xingming. Lu Xingrong was arrested and taken to the provincial government on January 6th of this year, after which he went to Shanghai and did not ask about military affairs due to disagreement with the government. He expressed dissatisfaction with this war, so he was greatly understood by Yang Shuzhuang. Currently, Lu's forces have withdrawn from Yan, Jian, and Shao prefectures and are temporarily stationed in Youxi, Shaxian, Yongan, Dehua, and Datian counties, awaiting reorganization by the central government. Therefore, there are no Lu's troops in the western suburbs of the provincial capital recently. The provincial capital announced the lifting of special martial law from the 11th of this month, and inspections are not as strict as before (September 12th).</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Business Guilds Request Exemption from Apportionment</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: The various business guilds have recently been strictly apportioned a loan of 500,000 yuan by the Finance Department, so they have submitted petitions to various agencies requesting relief from business difficulties. The text of the petition is as follows: We petition for the extreme difficulty of business, requesting a transfer to the Finance Department to stop the loan process in order to relieve business difficulties. The reason is that the Finance Department has apportioned a loan of 500,000 yuan to the various business guilds. The business guilds have stated their difficulties and requested exemption, but this has not been examined, and the Finance Department has proceeded strictly according to its own will. The business guilds have no way to advance or retreat and have to cry bitterly to your association. Fuzhou is the center of the province, but it is neither a commercial production area nor a commercial sales market, but only a transportation hub for upstream and downstream. In recent years, there have been almost no peaceful days due to bandits and wars upstream and downstream. The commerce of the provincial capital has long since declined. In addition, the citywide road construction last year caused the business to stop and the construction required huge expenses. All businessmen were exhausted. Before the wounds were healed, the military affairs of Tao Lu arose again. The streams and rivers were cut off, and the whole city was in turmoil. Bills of exchange were delayed and the delivery dates were stopped. The businessmen themselves had nowhere to borrow money, let alone borrow from others. If it is said that there is borrowing and repayment, then the merchant is not donating. If the merchant has cash, bills of exchange can be cashed, and delivery dates can be arranged. However, even the most important problem is forced to sit and become a stalemate. Even if there are extremely credible pledges and extremely rich funds, there is no money to borrow. How can the Finance Department Chief see such a tragic situation of the merchants and immediately impose an apportionment upon arriving? It seems that it does not conform to the Three Principles of the People. Now, the business guilds believe that they have no power to borrow for self-defense, and they have no power. They can only present the difficulties and request your association to uphold justice and quickly transfer to the Finance Department to stop the loan to the business guilds in order to relieve business difficulties. We are grateful for your kindness.</p>
<p>In addition to the 80,000 yuan for the Qian Guild, which has been agreed upon, the Finance Department has set 150,000 yuan for the Tea and Wood Guilds, and the other guilds are also being agreed upon by the department for a quota of 150,000 yuan. The detailed numbers are as follows: 30,000 yuan for paper and stream, 30,000 yuan for silk and cloth, 16,000 yuan for pawn, 4,000 yuan for pine wood, 8,000 yuan for medicinal materials, 7,600 yuan for cotton yarn, 400 yuan for copy shop, 1,200 yuan for city sauce garden, 1,200 yuan for Taiwan sauce garden, 600 yuan for wine and rice, 400 yuan for stream rice, 280 yuan for Wubei rice, 1,600 yuan for tobacco leaves, 3,600 yuan for cotton ramie and water tobacco, 360 yuan for city Su and Guang, 600 yuan for Taiwan Su and Guang, 560 yuan for paint, 1,000 yuan for fresh fish, 1,000 yuan for salted fish, 600 yuan for Xiaoshandong, 6,254 yuan for wine, 1,040 yuan for iron, 2,000 yuan for gold, 660 yuan for pearls, 600 yuan for porcelain, 800 yuan for silk thread, 1,100 yuan for raw lacquer, 800 yuan for bean guild, 320 yuan for fruits, 600 yuan for fresh flowers, 600 yuan for miscellaneous boards, 740 yuan for city money style, 1,252 yuan for straight road money style, 1,120 yuan for horizontal road money style, 600 yuan for Qiaonan money style, 400 yuan for oil, 4,360 yuan for powder, 6,200 yuan for sea transportation, 4,000 yuan for passengers, 400 yuan for customs declaration, and 4,000 yuan for passenger wine. In recent days, the department has sent members Fang Yingtuan and Zheng Shupeng to directly urge the various commercial firms, but the merchants still find it difficult to accept.</p>
<h3>Nanning Still Under Siege</h3>
<p>Guangxi Army Flees to Hunan Border via Fuhe</p>
<p>Guangdong Supplies Yunnan Army with Ammunition to Attack Yong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: In the Guangxi province war, the Guilin army has recently moved around the area of ​​PingLe Longhu Pass. Zhang Fakui and Tang Shengming, etc. have also moved all troops out of the border of Guilin. Recently, the situation on the Fuhe side suddenly became tense. It is said that the Guilin army used newly compiled teams to deliberately advance into the area of ​​PingLe Zhaoping, so as to cover the retreat of their main force through Longhu Pass to the border of Hunan. Now most of them have crossed the border. All the new soldiers stationed in Zhaoping have returned to PingLe, and the garrison teams of Zhou Guozhi and Su Meisen, which were stationed in PingLe, have also retreated to Yangshuo a week ago. Xue Pingqing's troops stationed in Mengshan also retreated to Guilin on the 10th and took away the guns and equipment of the local militia. The newly compiled division of Huang Mingyuan, stationed in Xiuren Lipu, also retreated to Guilin on the same day. At present, from PingLe to Xiuren Lipu, there are only two militia teams stationed. The Guangxi Security Commander of the Eighth Route Army, Lu Dingxiang, believes that the enemy is retreating step by step and can take the opportunity to pursue. He specially sent a telegram from the front to ask for a strategy. The telegram said that it was reported that the rebel army stationed in Ping had fled to Yangshuo, and more than a hundred remnants of the rebel army stationed in Meng had fled to Guilin. All the counties of Pingzhao, Li, and Xiu were empty. The telegram was sent to the headquarters on Wen day to order friendly forces along the river to take all the counties. The telegram arrived, please ask the two staff officers to ask for instructions nearby and plan everything for the counterattack (omitted below). Dingxiang叩Yuan Chenyinyunyun The Guangxi army of Fuhe has retreated to the border of Hunan, and the exact report of its actions is not yet available. The northern Guangdong borders southern Hunan, and the Eighth Route Army has drawn a considerable force to defend the northwest Jiangxi. The Guangxi side is guarded by the Yu Hanmou and Li Yangjing divisions and Huang Renhuan brigade to guard the Fu and Da rivers. The Nanning side is still under siege. The Eighth Route Army sent an air force and warships to assist the Yunnan army in the siege. Now airplanes fly to Yongyuan every day to drop bombs, and the Fourth Fleet sent Haiou, Jiangda, Jiangshun, Pingxi, Xinsongjiang, and Lichen and other shallow-water ships to Yongchun River to assist in the attack on Yongcheng South Gate. Lu Han's Yunnan Army's 99th Division Zhu Xu's troops have been transferred from Wuming to attack Yong, only leaving the 3rd Brigade Sun Du's troops stationed in Wu to contact the Eighth Route Army Yu Division. Since the Yunnan Army sent representatives Zhu Lidong and Zeng Zesheng to Guangdong to request military pay and equipment, the military pay has been solved and will be subsidized by the central government, while Guangdong will provide them with ammunition. It is planned that the first batch transferred from Qinzhou, Nanlu will be handed over to the Yunnan Army Zhang Chong Division Long Tuan to transport into Guilin. The second batch will be transported by the Hairui ship to Qinlian for inventory, totaling more than 70 boxes of ammunition. In recent days, after the Yunnan Army received ammunition, the attack on Yong was very urgent. Zhang Chong and Zhu Xu, etc., are deployed in Mihua Gaofeng Tingziwei and other places to join the Eighth Route Army on all sides. At present, Nanning is under siege, and the Guilin army has been trapped for more than a month, and the ammunition is exhausted. The residents in the city are even more miserable. The traffic is blocked, and everything is expensive. The water for drinking costs several yuan per burden. It is conceivable that other prices are expensive. Moreover, airplanes arrive to drop bombs every day, and the residents have no defenses. Often, a bomb is dropped, and several members of the family are buried in the smoke and gunpowder. Therefore, they all hope that the Guilin army will leave as soon as possible, so that the military affairs can be resolved (September 17th).</p>
<h3>Recent Financial Situation of Guangdong Province</h3>
<p>Monthly Military Expenses Still Amount to 4.2 Million, National Treasury Loans No Less Than 31 Million</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the start of the military campaign in Guangdong Province, military expenses have consistently been above 4 million yuan per month, resulting in monthly administrative expenses being in arrears. The authorities are currently planning to set monthly military expenses at 4.2 million yuan and will not increase them any further. According to financial circles, the reason for the recent financial difficulties of the provincial treasury is entirely due to loans from the national treasury for military use. The provincial treasury is managed by the Department of Finance, while the national treasury is managed by the Finance Special Commissioner's Office, and the funds borrowed from the provincial treasury are all transferred by the national treasury for military salaries. It is found that from March of last year to August 15 of this year, the national treasury borrowed no less than 31.1 million yuan from the provincial treasury. If the military affairs cannot be ended in the future, the provincial treasury will continue to bear military expenses and loans of 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan per month. This large amount of expenses will not only affect the provincial administrative expenses from being paid on schedule, but also make it impossible to increase the education and construction expenses. Therefore, when the Yunnan Army representatives came to Guangdong to request military pay, the authorities politely declined because the military expenses were beyond the budget and introduced the Yunnan representatives to the central government to request direct supply from the National Government. Recently, the financial treasury bonds issued here have been sold in succession. According to statistics yesterday, as of mid-September, the total amount of bonds sold by the General Chamber of Commerce was 600,000, of which 200,000 have been sold; the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau was 850,000, of which 270,000 have been sold; the Shantou Branch Gold Treasury was originally set at 700,000 and 850,000 have been issued first; Beihai 40,000, Haikou Port 300,000, Jiangmen City 250,000, Shaozhou 200,000. In addition, the total amount directly purchased from the Department of Finance by various contractors and received by various counties was 3.4 million yuan. The total amount of funds returned by various agencies and contractors after underwriting was about 1.2 million yuan, of which half was paper and half was silver. The funds received were handed over to the Central Bank as a fund, which has been done four times: the first time was 68,000, the second time was 192,000, the third time was 134,000, and the fourth time was 60,000. The total amount deposited in the Central Bank was 454,000 yuan. The reason why various parties promoted the sale of treasury bonds this time was that a part of it stipulated that those who purchased it in the first month could receive half of the uncashed paper money, so before September 15, the citizens searched for uncashed paper money to pay rent and taxes. Therefore, the price of uncashed paper money has been higher than before. The price of uncashed five-yuan and ten-yuan bills from the Central Bank has risen to 86-87% in recent days. It is heard that the Central Bank is preparing to choose one of the above two types of bills and restore the exchange as soon as the finances are slightly active. The mill currency recasting factory under the jurisdiction of the Department of Finance has been closed for a long time. Until recently, it suddenly announced that Xu Xiqing was the director of the mill currency factory (Xu was the former mayor of Shantou). Xu took over the job on the 11th. He is currently actively repairing the machinery in the factory. According to Xu, the Department of Finance specially restored the mill currency factory to cast coins in order to circulate finances. Many Hong Kong dollars have been collected in advance for the purchase of raw silver, so the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars has risen from 305 to 321, which has no impact on the government. Since the factory is preparing raw silver, it can start casting around September 20. He is currently looking for workers to sort out the machinery and prepare everything (September 15th).</p>

<p>County and District Associations Strive to Retain the County Add-on Grain Tax: The Jiangsu Provincial County Agricultural, Forestry, and Sericulture Field Association, in view of the Finance Department's clear text order to add two yuan per stone to the county's grain tax, referred to the precedent and sent a letter to the county and district associations yesterday to jointly strive with the construction, education, and other bureaus to retain five corners for county use to fund local undertakings. The original letter is recorded below: We hereby inform you that the counties of our province have received the Finance Department's order to add two yuan per stone to the grain tax according to the precedent of the 16th year. However, the previous plan had five corners per stone retained for county use as an eleven-point distribution for local undertakings, with the agricultural, forestry, and sericulture field accounting for two-tenths and five-hundredths.

Shu, having no money on the boat, said he would find a way after reaching town. The accomplices of the bandit on the boat, including Wang Decai, Wang Xinbao, Wang Guiben, Xu Sheng, and Wang Ziliang, monitored him. After the boat reached town, they stayed at the Zhonghua Hotel together. Shu then managed to hand over 140 silver dollars.

<p>Thorough Investigation of the Shady Dealings of the Mongolian Relief Institute: Chen Tianmin, a member of the Second District, Second Branch of the party, stated that the Mongolian Relief Institute has been plagued by problems for years. Every year, it requests 2,000 yuan from the province, all of which is embezzled and divided among accomplices, and no relief is distributed. He had previously submitted a request to the county party headquarters, which was forwarded to the provincial party headquarters, requesting the provincial government to order the county government and the Small Benevolence Relief Institute to thoroughly investigate the institute. The institute has refused to hand over the account books for the past years and has not provided clear explanations for the suspicious points. Yesterday, he again proposed at the 23rd party member meeting of the Second District, Second Branch, to forward the request again for a swift investigation.</p>
<p>Seizure of a Privately Recruited Band of Bandits: Ma Shan, suspected to be from Zhenjiang, lived at No. 10 Minguo Spring Street outside the city.

A meeting has been held to decide on a method, modeled after the cases of Xinchang and Shengxian counties, to levy an additional four jiao per tael of land tax, which would yield 24,000 yuan. The remaining one-third, or 12,000 yuan, will be subsidized by merchants, with the shop tax as the standard for collection. In addition to submitting a request to the province for approval, the county magistrate and the county chamber of commerce will follow the plan to raise funds.</p>

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has received instructions from the Ministry of Education that the song and dance dramas performed by elementary schools during游藝 fairs are not in line with educational principles and are detrimental to the physical and mental health of children. The bureau has ordered all schools to comply.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders</h3>
<p>Private Schools to Apply for Registration by a Deadline</p>
<p>Those that do not meet the standards will be strictly shut down</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau yesterday issued an order to all unregistered private schools at all levels, stating that the Ministry of Education's order No. 932 stated that there are many private schools of varying quality in Shanghai and that they should all be registered as soon as possible for the purpose of reorganization. According to the bureau's report, the schools are often hesitant to register. The ministry instructed that those that do not meet the standards should be shut down according to law. However, recent reports indicate that unregistered private schools in Shanghai are still advertising for enrollment and creating various titles to exaggerate and attract attention. Their advertising shows that they are focused on profit and disregard reality. The bureau should select those that meet the agreed standards and urge them to register quickly, and strictly shut down those that do not meet the standards to avoid misleading young people and hindering education. The bureau has repeatedly issued notices urging private schools to comply with the regulations and register, and has sent personnel to supervise them. However, many unregistered schools still remain. In accordance with the previous order, in addition to thoroughly investigating and strictly shutting down all schools that do not meet the standards, all schools should be urged to comply with the regulations and apply for registration as soon as possible. Those that fail to comply will be deemed to have acknowledged that they do not meet the standards. The bureau will comply with the ministry's order to shut down those that do not meet the standards.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Vocational Guidance</h3>
<p>Agencies Joint Association Established Yesterday</p>
<p>Passed Constitution and Established Executive Committee</p>
<p>General Assembly to be Held in the Capital in December</p>
<p>Permanent Mailing Address: Chinese Vocational Education Society</p>
<p>The Chinese Vocational Guidance Agencies Joint Association held its founding meeting yesterday at the Chinese Vocational Education Society. More than sixty representatives from fifty agencies and organizations attended. Liu Zhanen chaired the meeting, and Wang Jianhou recorded the proceedings. After the usual formalities, the chairman delivered the opening address, followed by Jiang Wenyu, representing the Vocational Education Society, who gave a welcoming speech. Yang Weiyu then reported on the recent activities of the Vocational Education Society, and Pan Yangyao reported on the preparations for the association. He Qingru, Shen Yougan, and Chen Xuanshan delivered speeches. The meeting then discussed the agenda and adjourned. Afterwards, a tea party was held on the roof of the Vocational Education Society, followed by a banquet for the representatives. The details of the meeting are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attendees: Zhu Hange of the Shanghai County Education Bureau, Li Yizhi of the Patriotic Girls' Middle School, Wu Xixu and Wang Xingchi of the Wuxian Vocational Guidance Center, Wang Zemin of the Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Girls' Middle School, Xu Zihua of the Yixing County Education Bureau, Fei Dasheng of the Jiangsu Provincial Sericulture School, Cao Cishan of the Nantong County Education Bureau, Rui Ziyu of the Jiangsu Provincial Wuxi Middle School, Zhang Zhongbao of the Jiangsu Provincial Shanghai Middle School, Wang Fumin of the Puyi Society Vocational Introduction Department, Gu Wenwei of the Minli Middle School, Cheng Kuanzheng of the Wusong Middle School, Yang Chongya of the Tongji University, Niu Changyao of the Jingye Middle School, Xie Yicheng of the Nanjing Municipal Vocational Guidance Center, Shen Hongchen of the National Central University, Yu Shoumei of the Jiangsu Provincial Education College, Li Yongzhen and Chen Junren of the Nantong University Agricultural Science Department, Liu Zhanen of the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center, Bao Yuqi of the Guanghua University, Chen Xuanshan of the Datong University, Shen Wenmei of the Suzhou Middle School, Pan Yangyao of the Chinese Vocational School, Ding Yuan of the Shanghai Meiwei College, Xi Junyu of the Hujiang University, Yang Zhuofu of the Jiading County Education Bureau, etc.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches: Chairman Liu Zhanen's opening address stated that vocational guidance requires impartiality. If impartiality is emphasized, there is no need for vocational guidance. Most of China is currently unemployed, and even those who are employed are often unable to settle down and enjoy their work. Recognizing this, the Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center was established. The National Education Conference had important proposals and resolutions regarding vocational guidance. Now, universities, middle schools, and educational institutions across the country are establishing vocational guidance agencies. However, how to connect, research, and implement these agencies effectively requires the joint efforts of comrades in various regions. This is the reason for today's meeting. The Shanghai Vocational Guidance Center has been established for two years, and its mission is very important. The education community can easily evaluate its achievements, but it must always be based on scientific principles. The speaker has visited Europe and the United States twice and believes that they attach great importance to vocational guidance and that their methods are very suitable for their national conditions. However, Western and Chinese customs are different. To develop vocational guidance, we must use scientific methods and conduct thorough research. The promotion of vocational guidance requires investigation and statistics, so European and American vocational guidance agencies have a central statistics bureau. We must improve old professions and introduce new professions, and we must not engage in empty talk. We must combine society and education. Jiang Wenyu, Yang Weiyu, and Pan Yangyao's reports are omitted.</p>
<p>Constitution Adopted: (Article 1) The general assembly is organized by the Chinese Vocational Education Society in conjunction with vocational institutions nationwide to study matters relating to occupational guidance; (Article 2) All national organizations, universities, vocational schools, junior and secondary schools with occupational guidance organization or that pay attention to occupational guidance issues are eligible to join; (Article 3) The general assembly will hold an annual meeting, which is rotated and convened in different locations by the Executive Committee; (Article 4) Representatives of organizations are required to attend; (Article 5) The General Assembly elects 13 members to form an Executive Committee, which meets quarterly and is authorized to appoint experts to conduct research on occupational guidance issues; (Article 6) Application fee is divided into two types (Type A): pay ten yuan per year, (Type B) five yuan per year to be used for research, communication, printing, publishing and other activities by agencies which have joined; (Article 7) Agencies are allowed to ask questions or report their studies; (Article 8) Revisions of constitution can be made during the general assembly.</p>
<p>Resolution Adopted: One, all vocational guidance agencies should provide necessary contact and mutual assistance when they encounter difficulty in job placement and research to provide them with more convenient service; Two, vocational guidance agencies should jointly study methods of guidance to improve work efficiency; Three, vocational guidance agencies should recommend professional personnel to each other; Four, a request should be sent to each county's public education center to establish an occupational guidance department; Five, determine location, date and time for the General Assembly; Six, a decision should be made to hold the General Assembly in the capital; Seven, standard for occupational guidance should be defined; Eight, standard of procedures for occupational guidance in schools should be defined; Nine, standard table for vocational guidance should be defined; Ten, minimum level of organization for a vocational guidance organization should be defined.

<h3>Friendly Football Match</h3>
<p>French Army Wins Against Chinese B Mixed Team</p>
<p>Result: 4 to 3</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Federation B mixed football team played a friendly match against the French Russo warship team at the Chinese baseball field yesterday. About two thousand people watched the game, making it the first grand occasion for the new autumn football season. As a result, the French army won with a score of 4 to 1.</p>
<h3>First Half</h3>
<p>The French team kicked off, and after about twenty minutes, the French right inside forward scored a goal against the Combined team. The Combined team then launched an aggressive attack, displaying remarkable prowess. The goalkeeper of the Combined team demonstrated agility, saving several dangerous shots, which was no easy feat. Later, the right inside forward of the Combined team shot, but the ball was blocked by the French goalkeeper. The center forward then knocked the goalkeeper to the ground, and the right inside forward scored, tying the score at 1-1. The French center forward, with strong kicking skills and both intelligence and courage, gained possession of the ball in midfield and dribbled past players, attacking directly at the defense. The Chinese team conceded another goal. At the end of the first half, the French team led 2-1.</p>
<h3>Second Half</h3>
<p>The French team's momentum waned slightly, and the Chinese team seized the opportunity to attack. The center forward scored, tying the score at 2-2. The Chinese team's morale soared, and they frequently lingered in the opponent's half. The right wing then scored another goal, giving them a 3-2 lead. However, before long, the French center forward performed another remarkable feat. At this time, the Chinese team repeatedly found themselves in dangerous situations and were eventually penalized with a twelve-yard kick. The French center forward gently flicked the ball, but it did not go into the goal. As the game was about to end, the French center forward, using his true skill, scored, making the final score 4-2 in favor of the French team.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>Woman A: Oh dear! I broke a mirror. They say that means seven years of bad luck. What am I going to do? What am I going to do?</p>
<p>Woman B: Don't worry. Last year, my sister-in-law broke a mirror. She died less than half a year later. So she didn't even experience one year of the seven years of bad luck. What are you afraid of?</p>
<p>Pharmacist: In the middle of the night, disturbing my good dream. What serious illness has occurred?</p>
<p>Customer: I'm sorry. My wife is feeling unwell in her chest.</p>
<p>Pharmacist: Then she should drink a cup of plain boiled water. What medicine do you want to buy? Quick, tell me!</p>
<p>Customer: Thank you for reminding me. I'll go back and give her plain boiled water. I don't need to buy your medicine.</p>
<p>Man: My dear, this elopement of ours is no small matter. We must be careful about everything. We'll climb down from the window. Is that rope strong enough?</p>
<p>Woman: It doesn't matter. Anyway, my father and mother are holding it in the room for us. We certainly won't fall. If you're worried that the two of them aren't strong enough, we can ask my brother to help.</p>
<p>Ophthalmologist: Miss, you must apply this eye medicine three times a day. Don't forget.</p>

<h3>Snapshots of the Japanese Depression</h3>
<p>— Tsuru</p>
<p>Since the Hamaguchi Cabinet implemented the gold standard, the signs of economic depression in Japan have become increasingly apparent. In recent months, the number of unemployed in intellectual and labor circles has increased daily. Although authorities and political scholars have racked their brains to find countermeasures to the depression, they are merely stopgap measures and do not solve the problem.</p>
<p>The evil tide of the depression has swept across Japan. In newspapers, we see that people in many parts of Japan are eating tree bark and grass roots, just like the disaster victims in Shaanxi and Gansu in our country. Even in Tokyo, one of the world's five major metropolises, the economic depression is evident everywhere.</p>
<p>Nihonbashi, Kyobashi, and Ginza, a street about two Chinese miles long, is the most famous night market in Japan. The Japanese call it the "Street of Night." Every evening, when the lights come on, both sides of the street are filled with stalls selling all kinds of cheap goods. The crowds of tourists jostle shoulder to shoulder. Department stores on this street, such as Mitsukoshi and Matsuzakaya, all close at 9:00 PM. Looking down from these five-story buildings at the brightly lit, crowded streets, with trams and cars shuttling back and forth, one truly sees the beauty of the city. However, the night market on this street has now been eliminated by the times. When I went to visit the other day, I only saw scattered lights and stalls leaning haphazardly. Cars without passengers drove back and forth, calling out. Every ten minutes, I saw a lone tram slowly approaching from afar.</p>
<p>Next to the Kannon-do Hall in Asakusa District is a movie street. On this street, apart from two or three tobacco shops, the rest are all movie theaters or *shibai* (Japanese drama) theaters. I remember when I went there to see a play during the New Year last year, even though there was still an hour before the show started, all the theaters had "full house" signs hung up. But when I go back to look now, the scene has completely changed. About three-tenths of the hundred or so movie theaters have closed down. The remaining theaters that are still operating have added a promoter at the entrance. Whenever tourists pass by, they enthusiastically report on the day's program, how interesting the play is, and the big discounts, etc. However, the tourists seem to be made of iron and stone and are not moved by him at all.</p>
<p>There are fewer customers at various recreational places, but the number of visitors to libraries and parks has increased instead. The unemployed spend their days idly at home, so they go to public libraries to read magazines, pictorials, and newspaper advertisements. They stay there all day, not even coming out to eat. They are not forgetting to eat because they are engrossed in their studies, but because their pockets are empty. When they are tired at night, the park becomes their lodging.</p>
<p>Although national education is good, Japanese citizens, because they have no way to make a living, cannot help but take actions outside the law. Therefore, the number of theft and arson cases has recently broken Japan's new record. People starving and collapsing on the streets, unable to make a living, and killing their wives and committing suicide are heard of every day. The demon of depression is rampant. Let's see what methods they use to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Antiquities Discovered in Shaanxi Province</h3>
<p>— Ji Guan</p>
<p>According to a recent communication from a friend, Shaanxi Province is located in a remote mountainous area with obstructed transportation. Last month, a Northwest Scientific Expedition team happened to pass through the area and saw locals engaged in hunting. They discovered a yellow weasel's burrow. They dug vigorously downwards, reaching about five feet, when they suddenly felt something covering it horizontally. Upon inspection, it turned out to be ancient stone arrowheads, stone axes, stone knives, and other such items. They were covered in mottled moss and had an ancient appearance. There were a total of more than fifty pieces. The news spread like wildfire, and people rushed to see them. After being identified by the team members, they were determined to be relics from the late Neolithic Age and early Bronze Age before the Flood. They are about three thousand years old. At that time, China had not yet entered the era of written records.</p>
<p>In addition, more than two hundred bamboo slips of various sizes were discovered. Engraved at the top are era names such as Yuanshi, Yuankang, Dijie, and Shiyuan. The characters are all in Han clerical script, which is exceptionally elegant. They can serve as a reference material for historians. However, these objects were buried underground for nearly two thousand years. The reason they have lasted so long is due to the dry ground and the lack of rain throughout the year. It is said that the team has now completed its investigation and returned fully loaded. Their future contribution to science will certainly be significant.</p>
<h3>Watching the Autumn Tide at Jiubao</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qinghua</p>
<p>The autumn tide of the Qiantang River in Zhejiang is a famous spectacle in our province. Every year during the tidal season, countless tourists from home and abroad flock to see it. As a result, the remote Haining has become famous far and wide. However, the audience only knows Haining as the destination for watching the tide, and does not know that the area between Babao and Jiubao, about twenty miles east of Haining, is an even greater spectacle. The force of the tide is far greater than that at Haining, because the area happens to be where the southern tides meet. The two tides collide, constantly reaching heights of more than ten *zhang* (approximately 33 meters), swirling and descending into a curved shape, before regrouping and rushing towards Haining. Therefore, the occasional high tides that rise suddenly at Haining are actually the rebound of the aftershocks from the Babao area.</p>
<p>Last year, Zhu Jiahua, the Commissioner of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province, visited and appreciated the view with Yan Youfu, the Magistrate of Haining County. They marveled at the spectacle. This year, due to weather conditions, the tides are particularly fierce. More than a hundred *zhang* of the solid stone embankment in the area were destroyed by the tide. Even the new-style sloped stone embankment, built under the supervision of an Austrian engineer, was breached by the fierce tide. Moreover, near Jiubao East, the river tide actually crossed three tidal defense embankments and rushed into the inner river, Chenfen River. Even the Hangping Highway, about half a *li* (approximately 0.5 km) from the seawall, was broken by the incoming tide. Therefore, the force of the tide, the height of the collision, and the grandeur of the scene are all breathtaking. I record this to introduce it to the audience.</p>
<h3>A Brief Biography of the Goddess</h3>
<p>— Shen Hengzhuang</p>
<p>The most famous classical beauty on the American screen, Corinne Griffith, starred in a historical romantic sound drama for First National Company this spring. Its name is "The Divine Lady."</p>
<p>The plot of the drama is entirely based on the famous work "The Divine Lady" by the famous writer Barrington, and is adapted into a portrayal of the love affair between Nelson, the great English hero of the eighteenth century, and the beauty Emma Hamilton. It is extremely passionate and expresses the emotions to the fullest, becoming a historical costume sound drama that has never been seen before in the film industry.</p>
<p>In this film, Corinne plays the charming and gentle beauty Emma, looking even more beautiful than in her previous works. In short, First National Company's production of this film and Corinne's starring role in this drama can be called two great successes. It is said that the film is currently being screened at a summer peak.</p>
<h3>Zeng Nongran's Cherishing of His Reputation</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Zeng Nongran's passing has already been recorded by his peers. There are still some details that have not been fully explained, so I will elaborate further. Nongran, whose given name was Xi, was from Hengyang. His calligraphy was famous throughout the country. He would write sparsely on a fan or album, only a few lines, but with an antique and extraordinary air. Others, although they tried to imitate him, could not achieve the same effect. Sometimes he also engaged in painting. In the fans collected at the Xinhange Pavilion, I saw a landscape painting he made, which was vast and profound, directly approaching the ancients. It was rare to find his equal among contemporary artists. However, the painting was overshadowed by his reputation as a calligrapher, and few people knew about it. There was a person named Fang Langao, who was a fellow townsman of Nongran. Last year, Langao came to Shanghai for business and visited Nongran at his residence. Meeting a fellow townsman in a foreign land was an occasion for great joy. The weather was hot, and Langao waved a folding fan. Nongran took it to look at it and realized that it was his own handwriting, which he had given to Langao twenty years ago. He felt that his brushwork was immature and not worthy of being shown to others. Therefore, he asked Langao for it and tore it up. He spent the entire day creating a masterpiece to compensate him. Such was his meticulousness in cherishing his reputation. Nongran was also skilled in poetry, but he was dignified and did not deign to write about the love affairs of women. The Shanghai painter Zhang Shanzi created a "Twelve Beauties of Jinling" painting and asked him to write a poem for it. Nongran firmly refused. But when he read the painting, he realized that the so-called "Twelve Beauties of Jinling" were not about love affairs in boudoirs, but twelve tiger paintings of variegated colors. He repeatedly exclaimed "cunning" and wrote a poem for it with a smile. Nongran once stayed at an inn somewhere when a mutiny suddenly broke out. At night, soldiers went out to loot. The travelers were terrified and extinguished their candles, hiding in the dark corners. Nongran alone remained calm and unafraid, keeping his lamp brightly lit. He deliberately scattered his luggage and overturned his boxes, creating a chaotic scene as a diversion. The mutinous soldiers thought that there was nothing of value to plunder and did not even take a single thread. None of the other travelers were spared. They all praised his quick wit. Among the travelers, there was one who had run out of money and was in a predicament. Nongran instead helped him with funds so that he could return home quickly.</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Nanyang (57)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the 24th, I visited Yang Xiaotang, the new Consul of Penang, who is from Shanghai and speaks Cantonese. I was fortunate to meet him after he visited me yesterday. We talked about the situation when he first came to this place, emphasizing the importance of uniting Chinese and foreign friendship. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now changed the regulations for overseas Chinese going abroad, requiring passports for both going abroad and returning home. Each passport costs eight yuan. The Consul has already issued a notice to the overseas Chinese. The regulations will take effect on June 1st. I don't know if there will be any obstacles to their implementation. Because ships depart every day, each ship carries thousands of Chinese people. If they must pay for a passport, it will also be a problem for the workers.</p>
<p>For people traveling to various states in British Malaya, passports are not usually required. Now, a passport is required to return to China, which the workers consider an additional burden. Those traveling to various ports in third-class cabins do not need a passport, but they must pay a head tax. It costs thirty yuan to go to Annam. Workers' luggage is confiscated upon arrival and must be redeemed with thirty yuan. It costs one hundred guilders to go to the Netherlands. Each guilder is equivalent to about one Shanghai silver dollar. This amount covers six months. If one does not leave the country within six months, it is confiscated. If one leaves the country, it is returned. It is said that it costs sixteen yuan per person to land in Luzon, and this amount will be increased. Moreover, they deliberately treat people harshly by inspecting their bodies and measuring their health, but this is just an excuse to create difficulties. People say that the Dutch used to treat the Japanese in this way, but when the Dutch went to Japan, the Japanese treated the Dutch in the same way. After that, the Dutch did not dare to treat the Japanese in this way, and they treated each other with courtesy. But they only treat the Chinese in this way. It is deplorable that a small country like the Netherlands mistreats the Chinese in this way. It is also said that Siam treats the Chinese entering the country very vexatiously. In the future, it will be difficult for the Chinese to go abroad. Alas!</p>
<p>On the 25th, I visited the Kek Lok Si Temple on Crane Mountain to see the various jade Buddha statues. When I first arrived in Nanyang, I felt a kind of interest, namely, jade Buddha statues. In Singapore, almost every temple has them. They are not made of jade, but of a white and lovely stone. The statues are also different from those in China and do not resemble Chinese people. Generally, Buddha statues differ according to the location. Japanese Buddha statues resemble Japanese people, Mongolian Buddha statues resemble Mongolians, and modern Indian Buddha statues resemble Indians. Therefore, the Buddha statues here are more realistic. Jade Buddha statues come in various sizes. Small ones cost one or two yuan, while large ones cost dozens or hundreds of yuan and are taller than people. Regardless of whether they are real or not, seeing their delicate eyebrows inspires a sense of transcendence. Kant's theory of aesthetics ultimately leads to disinterest. Buddha statues are deeply immersed in this samadhi, so they are the ultimate in beauty. Compared to today's bronze statues, which only express masculinity, they are more thought-provoking. I inquired about the origin of these statues. It is said that they are from Yangon, Myanmar. I have rarely seen jade Buddha statues in China for decades, except for the Jade Buddha Temple of Sheng Xuanhuai in Shanghai. This is because jade Buddha statues are rare in China. Efforts should be made to circulate these statues to various countries to transform the atmosphere of violence. I heard that the stone also varies in quality, and it would be even better if it were decorated with gold. It is different from the marble of Dali, Yunnan. If the Yunnan Road were open, it could also be made in Yunnan. I heard that this stone is also available in Ipoh, but there is not much of it.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (282)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Sheds Tears, Her Heart Breaks; Crimson Lotus Fades, a Woman's Soul Departs</p>
<p>Zhang Yiqing turned around and thought that he was a little unfair to this woman. Although she is not uncomfortable now, in name, she is neither fish nor fowl. He had to try his best to comfort her for a while. The woman wiped her tears and said, "I have long had the intention for you to marry another person. After a person reaches middle age, they naturally always want to have a son under their knees. But unfortunately, I am not in good health and cannot bear children. If you marry someone else and she bears a son or daughter, that would be good. Your children will also be my children. I will certainly treat them the same way. You thought I would be jealous if you married someone else, so you hid it from me. You really don't know my heart; you have truly wronged me." Zhang Yiqing felt relieved after hearing this. He thought that she probably felt old and unattractive herself. Moreover, everyone is in middle age, and she has come to her senses. It is not just a robber having a change of heart; it is also the truth. He said, "I am very grateful that you can be so understanding. The reason I didn't tell you was not because I intended to hide it from you, but because you were sick. I was afraid that you would be unhappy and get sick from the anger. I thought it would be better to tell you slowly." The woman said, "But I have one idea; I don't know if you are willing to listen. My idea is that young people living outside are always a little uncared for. In the past, you hid it from me and didn't let your family know, so you had to rent a small house outside. Now that I already know, there is no need to hide it anymore. Why not bring her home? First, you don't have to run back and forth. Second, times are difficult now, and it will save a little money after all. Third, it will be more lively at home. Fourth, I am older than her after all and have eaten more years of rice. I can give her some pointers. She can also help me with household chores. People from their profession, to be honest, don't know anything about housekeeping at all. They can learn some rules of a proper family. Do you think I'm right?" Originally, when Zhang Yiqing heard her reveal his secret, his heart had been pounding. He thought there would be a big commotion. Because Zhang Yiqing had gone to brothels before and didn't come home, she had made a scene several times. Now, not only is she not making a scene, but she is also saying such pitiful things. He felt a little uneasy. Moreover, what she is saying at this moment is all upright and righteous. How could you ask for more? She allows you to marry a concubine, and when she comes, she is willing to guide and teach her. It couldn't be better. Running back and forth is not good. The expenses of two families are certainly greater. Her words are all very correct. Zhang Yiqing thought, now that everything is clear, of course, it is best to have Cuiyun move back.</p>

<p>Fluctuations of Bullion Prices Unpredictable Last Week</p>
<p>Bullion prices fluctuated by as much as 21.5 taels throughout the week. The downward trend continued in the bullion market last week. However, it coincided with the rollover to the November contract, which was a bullish move. But it was very different from the previous month's rollover. It seemed like there was a lot of spot gold, but major players were willing to roll out at a low price, only accounting for a little over five taels to within four taels. As for the November contract, it initially started off strong on the 16th (Tuesday), once rising to 552 taels. But it was a flash in the pan and immediately went downstream due to the impact of the Japanese political turmoil. The public was extremely confused, causing the market to become chaotic and volatile. Soon after, it broke through the 40-tael mark. On Friday (19th), it suddenly plummeted to 530 taels and five cents. Because the war was going smoothly, the situation was expected to be peaceful, and bills of exchange might be loosened, the price plummeted. However, that afternoon, a major player covered their short position, causing the price to suddenly rise sharply, jumping nearly 10 taels and reaching outside the 40-tael mark by the weekend. The high and low prices of the contract since the beginning of the month differed by as much as 21.5 taels. However, the chaotic situation made it difficult to grasp. The overseas silver market saw a slight increase, while bills of exchange lengthened by one grade. The price quoted by the Japanese gold market initially reduced by about 50 taels, but later reduced by more than 60 taels. However, it returned to flat by the weekend, around 50 taels. As for spot gold, it seemed to be trending upwards. Initially, the premium for spot gold was about 22-23 taels, but it later increased to 27-28 taels. However, most of the spot gold was in the hands of bullish players, who were collecting public orders. Here is a summary of the past week:</p>
<p>Fell 17 Taels by Weekend Starting with November rolled contract trade on the 16th (Tuesday), opening 549 taels (October contract was 541.1, only usual elimination of profit and loss mostly changing over to November). Buyer support was active soon after up 3 taels, once reaching 52 taels. Big bars and shilling remained flat. During noon hour, rumour arose regarding a disturbance in the Japanese cabinet, confidence dissipated, and a waterfall drop of 8 taels settling at 44 taels. In the afternoon it bounced, and a large house suddenly bought support, returning up to 49 taels, closing at around 48 taels. The total range for the day was 8 taels. Next day silver bars remained flat, silver prices increase by a bit with a 1-2-5 rise. Bill of exchanges were unmoved, however internal market was slightly looser. Gold price open lower in the morning on news that the British and Americans jointly agreed the world silver price has fallen drastically so have taken measure to support the declining momentum, so big bars may return to rise in value. From this market received this news, confidence immediately spread, and seller activity suddenly increased and price dropped 4-5 taels. And especially severe decline was driven by decisive Japanese political turmoil immediately breaking through the 40 tael barrier, after there were 3-4 tael swings around that level. The eventual result was trading around 40 taels. It's heard that those who haven't closed out their November contract total 10,000 contracts, so the bulls are rushing to roll out, lowering the rollover price to only 3.5 taels but this is still unachieved because the shorts are locked, not rolling out. In short, there's seems to be influence of lots of spot, only until the next day that it returned to equilibrium, increasing to 4 taels. Thursday, large bars and silver prices both rose, and shilling also rose by half grade. Internal markets loosened accordingly with market operators releasing pounds, and gold prices breaking the 40 taels barrier. In the afternoon the market became especially tired with rumors of Northwest army suffering heavy defeat. Yan Xishan even declared resignation, and prices declined steeply to 35 taels and 3 cents. Closing price rising by 1 tael. Total day's trading was 7 taels, down 4 taels from the previous day. Cumulative decline from those two days totaled 11.2 taels. Next day big bar continued to increase, exchange price also increasing. and internal price being weak was strengthened. The distinction between bright and dark was that big bar and prices rose as a result of the unstable situation in the North so the big houses were inclined to let it go, so a sudden and rapid decline of 6 taels at a stroke became 30 taels and 5 cents. And then in the afternoon a speculator stepped in and made a recovery, with talk that India were rumored to be issuing gold bar, and after this rose 8-9 taels. Total trading volume was 9 taels. Reviewing that week the silver market recovered marginally. The only exception to no movement was the shillings which stayed firm, a slight gain was enjoyed by daily gold of .25. Meanwhile bank internal market remained flat and the bullion trade seemingly trended upwards and pierced through the 40 tael barrier, with trade moving up and down within a two tael band for a prolonged time. The overall differential was 5 taels and 6 cents. The potential was of a slight gain. But the speculator Wu sold out which immediately retreated the market to a level within 38 taels. Results wise ended with a price of 39 taels and 6 cents and so around the 40 tael barrier investor confidence was disturbed. The whole range was unstable. Trading finished up to 17 taels from the prior Saturday. The range with the rollover within 4-5 taels will soon diminish. The highs and lows of trading in silver in England, America and India are as follows</p>

<h3>Sudden tightening of funds on Sunday</h3>
<p>Foreign exchange rises to 3 fen, 5 li, 3 hao, 7 si, 5 hu.</p>
<p>Silver swap also rises to 1 cent and 5 fen.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange trend has been escalating over the past few days and silver fund situation has seemingly remained steady. The cause was the closure of banks due to the Sunday values causing a financial traffic jam and liquidity issue which lead to a significant rise in silver swap values with morning trade at 1 cent and 5 fen. This increased 7 fen compared to the morning of the prior day with the highest values recorded this half of the year. The exchange mid day trade price recovered two fen to become 1 cent and 3 fen.

Opening trade volume at 160,000 jiao and opening trade volume at 190,000 jiao trade. Steel Yuan value was increased 500 to now at 384,500 Wen</p>
<h3>The Origin of the Tight Money Market</h3>
<p>Insufficient Silver Bullion Reserves Lead to Inadequate Minting of Silver Dollars for Supply</p>
<p>Since the surge in the price of gold in Shanghai, the abundance of silver on the market has been unprecedented. Fearing unusual market fluctuations, the government and municipal authorities prohibited the export of gold and the import of silver. This prevented foreign silver from entering Shanghai, leading to the shipment of large bars of Shanghai's silver reserves to Hong Kong and other ports. As a result, the money supply appeared superficially loose, but the actual silver reserves were far less than in previous years. Recently, due to anticipated rise in the exchange rate for silver dollars, financial circles requested the Hangzhou Mint to increase production. However, the lack of raw materials prevented full-scale minting. Consequently, only 240,000 silver dollars were minted daily. Although the output of silver dollars was limited, the daily demand for raw material in the form of large bars reached one hundred and several tens. This posed a significant logistical challenge, and the market supply fell far short of demand. As a result, the exchange rate for silver dollars remained high, and the shortage of raw material bars led to a tightening of the money supply. This, in turn, caused the rise in silver interest rates yesterday. However, industry insiders predict that the reopening of banks today (Monday) may ease the situation slightly.</p>

<p>Public Bond Transactions Exceed 90 Million Last Week</p>
<p>Victories in the War Lead to Increased Speculation and Sharp Price Increases</p>
<p>Last week's public bond trading saw clear activity in the spot market. A total of only 91,500 yuan was traded throughout the week, including 45,000 yuan in demobilization bonds, 11,500 yuan in customs bonds, and the remainder in transactions of only five or six thousand yuan. The futures market remained very active. Except for Monday, when trading was only about 9 million yuan, Thursday reached over 22.2 million yuan, and Friday was also close to 20 million yuan. The daily average reached around 14 million yuan. The massive volume of transactions was unprecedented this year. Among them, demobilization and disbandment bonds were the most popular, with disbandment bonds being particularly active, accounting for a staggering 35.7 million yuan. This set a new record, with 8.545 million yuan for the September contracts and 27.155 million yuan for the October contracts. The demobilization bonds saw nearly 30 million yuan in transactions, with 10.06 million yuan for the September contracts and 19.46 million yuan for the October contracts. Customs bonds accounted for 5.285 million yuan for the September contracts and 8.595 million yuan for the October contracts. Reconstruction bonds, the Sixth Year Bonds and 19th Year Rolled Tobacco Bonds also doubled compared to the previous week. Reconstruction bonds accounted for 2.565 million yuan for the September contracts and 2.215 million yuan for the October contracts. 19th Year Rolled Tobacco Bonds saw 2.085 million yuan for the September contracts and 2.88 million yuan for the October contracts. The Sixth Year Bonds saw 980,000 yuan for the September contracts and 1.675 million yuan for the October contracts. However, other bonds remained sluggish. 96 Bonds saw 215,000 yuan for the September contracts and 410,000 yuan for the October contracts. Continued Rolled Tobacco Bonds saw 485,000 yuan for the September contracts and only 5,000 yuan for the October contracts. Continued 25 Bonds only saw 215,000 yuan for the September contracts. Financial Bonds amounted to 80,000 yuan, and the Seventh Year Bonds to 15,000 yuan. As for the price fluctuations of bonds, the trend was relatively stable at the beginning of the week. However, on Tuesday and Wednesday, frequent news of victories from the front lines boosted market confidence, and buying became increasingly active, leading to sharp price increases. By Thursday, market sentiment became even more tense, as the Northeast suddenly expressed its support for the Central Government and mobilized to enter the Guanzhong region. The forces of Yan and Feng were severely threatened, and it was hoped that the Central Plains War would end soon. As a result, the public bond market saw a surge in buying, with investors actively seeking to accumulate holdings. The market prices rose sharply, so much that the recent disbandment bonds were temporarily suspended from trading on that day due to excessive price increases. Afterwards, market sentiment calmed down slightly, and various parties took profits as bond prices had already risen significantly, leading to some confusion. However, compared to the previous week, the overall trend was still significantly higher. The following is a summary of the highest, lowest, and rising/falling prices of bonds last week (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Yarn Market Benefited from the Current Situation Last Week</p>
<p>Spot Prices Rose by Two to Three Taels, Marks up Three Taels or More, and Trading was Also Active. At the beginning of the week, the yarn market was somewhat unstable. Due to rampant banditry in various regions, inventory was heavy, with approximately 140,000 to 150,000 bales in stock. The chaotic war situation caused widespread panic, and buyers were hesitant. Consequently, prices for all months fell below the nine tael mark. However, towards the end of the week, due to changes in the local military situation and optimistic news, market sentiment improved significantly. Small investors aggressively covered short positions, and certain manufacturers made large-scale purchases, adding to their positions. Prices surged by three to four taels in a single day. On Saturday, prices fell slightly, but the overall bullish trend was strong. Actual sales were relatively active. Total transactions for the week amounted to 16,300 bales, with 2,300 bales traded among local firms. Prices rose by two to three taels, and the marks for each month rose by three taels compared to the previous week. Total transactions amounted to 165,550 bales. The following is a breakdown of the number of bales purchased by various groups:</p>

<h3>Gloomy View of the Cotton Market Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market was in poor condition. US cotton consumption decreased significantly, and good production led to new low prices. In India, the domestic political turmoil was turbulent, and many yarn factories were suspending operations. There was a surplus of raw materials, and the urgent need to find a way out led to competitive price cuts for overseas sales. Consequently, market prices were extremely cheap, and Chinese and Japanese factories made large purchases. Transactions of domestic cotton decreased significantly. However, the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang suffered considerable losses due to the adverse weather conditions, so inland merchants had strong intentions to buy. Market prices were able to remain firm. However, Hubei experienced a bumper harvest, but banditry was rampant, and purchasing was hesitant. As a result, the Hankou cotton market was not very active, and the price of marks cotton was somewhat lower. Because a certain yarn factory used cotton yarn to limit the purchase price to two taels, it was maintained for a while. However, the price of Indian cotton continued to decline, making it difficult to support the market alone. The weekend saw a general deterioration of the trend, with Indian cotton purchased by various factories. The market price fell again, and marks cotton also fell by two, three, or four coppers. Total transactions for the week amounted to 300,530 dan. According to the source at the wharf, there were 13,800 dan of Yao cotton and 1,300 dan of general cotton. The total amount of Indian cotton futures and domestic cotton purchased by various factories was 75,000 dan, and 11,111 dan by firms. The following is a breakdown of the number of bales purchased by each manufacturer and firm, with the time limit specified:</p>

<h3>American and British Cotton are Exhausted and Listless</h3>

Futures fell one to six pounds per point, and spot prices fell five pounds per point. British cotton futures fell two to three points, now down seven points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell ten points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded below (telegram of the 20th):</p>

<p>The New Rice Market is Declining</p>
<p>Yesterday, the number of ships arriving at Zhabei Luli Road was around 40, mainly carrying new rice. Sales on this street were sluggish and there were few transactions, and market sentiment was very weak. Fortunately, the price of broken rice stabilized because the river inventory of this product was less than 200 shi, so the price was still set at 20.078 yuan. There was a surge in deliveries of Western new rice, with 20 ships arriving yesterday. Buying interest was very weak, and prices continued to fall sharply. The opening price in the morning was still at 19.23 yuan, but the best quality goods were only at 19 to 18.8 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 1.1 yuan from the previous day. It is difficult for this kind of declining market to stabilize, and most people expect it to fall to 16 or 17 yuan. The arrival of Eastern new rice was still not significant, but it was difficult to maintain the inventory, so selling pressure increased, and the price fell by another half yuan. Currently, the opening price is 19 to 18.5 yuan, and ordinary rice is already around 18 yuan. Deliveries of new Yangjian rice were also eager, and outbound sales were sluggish. Observations showed that goods priced at 13.5 yuan were already of upper-middle quality, so goods priced at 14 yuan must be particularly high quality. However, given this market situation, it is necessary to see a short decline of 4 to 6 coppers. New Dujian, New Suibaijian, New Bujian, etc. also fell sharply across the board, dropping by 2, 3, 4, or 5 coppers, and it was difficult to stop the decline. Only New Kejian saw a slight rise of 1 or 2 coppers because the shorts were covering their positions due to the continuous sharp declines. High-quality goods were priced at 13 yuan, and ordinary goods at 12.5 yuan. Currently, the market for New Rice and Geng Youmi is not easy to maintain. The owners of the arriving Shanghai goods are all seeking quick sales, because the next batch will arrive soon, so they are competing to sell first. Therefore, the market situation still needs to be downstream. The arrival of goods at Yuanhe was slight, and sales were flat. The price was still above the 19 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 10 ships arrived in Hunan, Shanghai. The market situation was weak. High-quality old broken rice was exhausted. There was little trading in the mid-level passes, and prices were tired by half copper. The opening price was 19.5 yuan. The market shape of thin broken rice was flat and tired, but there was little going in and out due to the lack of goods. New rice also fell here, and high-quality goods opened at only 18.5 yuan, needing to subtract 4 to 5 coppers. Deliveries of Xiang rice were few, and the price was slightly short by two coppers. The price was reluctantly opened at 19.78 yuan. New Yangjian saw a drop of 3 to 4 coppers, with high-quality rice at 13.5 yuan. Dujian was the same, while Baijian opened at 15.5 yuan, only recovering 2 coppers. The decline here felt slightly more peaceful, but the market followed the northern market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Wufu Ice Industry Has Sold Out</p>
<p>Although the ice business has been active recently, customers are focusing on top-quality products. The two batches of Wufu ice that arrived were immediately sold out. Yesterday, 150 boxes were opened, with each box priced at 6 taels and 7 qian. This batch has been completely sold out. According to telegraphic reports, the factory is rushing to produce more, and it is expected to arrive soon. In addition, the quality of Wangmao ice has been improving recently. Yesterday, several hundred boxes were opened, priced at 6 taels and 6 qian, on par with Wufu ice. It has promising prospects.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Xinghua Grade Two Appears</p>
<p>New Xinghua Grade Two Longans arrived yesterday on three ships from Fu'an and other places. The total number of boxes exported from the production area reached 27,000, with about 10,000 boxes shipped to Shanghai. The rest were transferred to Ningbo and other places for sale. This year's Xing Yuan harvest is quite abundant. It is expected that the standard Jiechun Grade Two will be around 50 taels. The evening meeting decided that formal sales will begin today.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Shaoxing Autumn Cocoon Market Ends</p>
<p>A Little Over 30% of the Cocoons are Spun; Cocoon Prices are 56 Yuan per Spindle</p>
<p>This year's autumn cocoon harvest in the four townships of Shaoxing was poor, and only 40% of the cocoon shops opened. After six or seven days of opening, there were very few goods arriving on the market, and the cocoon market ended. Only a little over 30% of the cocoons are spun, and the amount received by the cocoon shops is limited. Also, there are not many high-quality cocoons, and the average cocoon price is 56 yuan per spindle. A portion of the officials responsible for handling the autumn cocoons have already returned to Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Fellow comrades, representatives from all walks of life: Today is the tenth anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Zhu Zhixin. We commemorate the day ten years ago in the Republic of China when Mr. Zhu Zhixin, a martyr of our party, a believer of the Prime Minister, and the creator and protector of the Republic of China, was murdered by the Gui系 warlords. Mr. Zhu's sacrifice for the country and the nation is certainly worthy of our commemoration. His daily actions, scholarship, and morality are also worthy of our enthusiastic commemoration. Mr. Zhu was exceptionally intelligent. He received excellent teaching from his father in his childhood. Therefore, at the age of sixteen, he had a deep understanding of Chinese classics such as the Four Books and Five Classics, the Twenty-Four Histories, and was knowledgeable about all scientific common sense. After the age of sixteen, he studied mathematics because he felt that mathematics was the foundation of all sciences. Therefore, he was proficient in algebra and calculus. After the age of twenty, he studied politics and law in Japan. Therefore, Mr. Zhu also had a profound understanding of social sciences. After returning to China, he studied English and Russian. Thanks to his extraordinary intelligence and diligent study, he was fluent in difficult texts of any country. This is Mr. Zhu's educational experience. Later, when he entered society, he devoted himself to revolution. He worked even harder in promoting the revolution through writing, helping to organize the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Japan, calling on comrades to found the Min Bao newspaper, publicizing the true meaning of revolution, clarifying revolutionary theories, and encouraging revolutionary courage, so that the national masses were awakened from their dreams and participated in the revolutionary movement to overthrow the Qing government. Therefore, Mr. Zhu and Mr. Hu Hanmin, Mr. Dai Jitao, and Mr. Liao Zhongkai were the four strongmen who helped the Prime Minister promote the revolution through writing in the beginning. Mr. Zhu not only worked hard to promote the revolution through writing, but also worked very hard in action. Mr. Zhu presided over everything in the Battle of Zhennanguan. Mr. Zhu also participated in the Battle of Huanghuagang on March 29th. Initially, Mr. Zhu was wearing a bamboo cloth long gown. He felt that the long gown was inconvenient, so he cut it in half and led many comrades to rush into the Guangzhou yamen. Although he did not suffer misfortune that time, he was seriously injured. Later, Mr. Zhu also participated in the battles to punish Yuan and protect the law. If the counter-revolutionaries were not eliminated for one day, Mr. Zhu's fighting spirit and revolutionary courage would not stop for one day. Therefore, Mr. Zhu never stopped fighting in his life and fought to the death with the reactionaries. Finally, he was murdered by the Gui系 warlords. Mr. Zhu finally sacrificed for the revolution in the ninth year of the Republic of China. This is a general overview of Mr. Zhu's revolutionary work in his life. At the same time, Mr. Zhu also had several virtues that ordinary people could not possess. The first is the spirit of thrift and simplicity. Mr. Zhu wore cloth clothes and trousers, ate green vegetables and light meals, and the house he lived in was especially narrow and simple. When he was in exile in Japan in the beginning, his economy was very difficult, but when comrades from other provinces asked him to borrow money, he never refused. Even if he did not have it himself, he tried to find a way to help others. The second is Mr. Zhu's active fighting spirit. Mr. Zhu encountered many difficulties and hardships in his life, but he was not at all passive. He always said generously to the revolutionary party members who retreated in the face of difficulties and deserted in the face of battle: "We eat the food of the common people, wear the clothes of the common people, and live in the houses of the common people. If we don't do things for the common people, can we still be considered human beings?" How could he not know that the reactionaries wanted to get him, but he was not afraid, not afraid, and not passive at all. He would rather be sniped by the reactionaries than be afraid of the reactionaries' plot to survive and stop the revolutionary work. He had a revolutionary outlook on life of living for the revolution and dying for the revolution, so he cultivated an active fighting spirit. Third, Mr. Zhu's profound knowledge was beyond the reach of ordinary comrades. Mr. Dai Jitao said that Mr. Zhu read more books than I did and had a higher understanding, so his knowledge was also higher than mine. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that Chen Yingshi's understanding of the revolution was very accurate, and his revolutionary spirit was also beyond the reach of ordinary people, but his knowledge was a little lacking. Zhixin's understanding and spirit of the revolution were about the same as Yingshi's, but Zhixin's knowledge was much higher than Yingshi's. Mr. Hu Hanmin also said that Mr. Zhu Zhixin was able to integrate the theories of famous scholars in the world. Of course, it was Mr. Zhixin's hard work, but it was also Mr. Zhixin's great and unique point. Now it has been ten years since Mr. Zhu was murdered by the reactionaries. Today, ten years later, the reverse flame of the reactionaries has not been completely eliminated, and the imperialists' oppression of China is becoming more and more serious every day. The responsibility after the sacrifice of the martyrs is to be borne by us who died later. Today, we commemorate Mr. Zhu's martyrdom, understand Mr. Zhu's revolutionary life, and understand Mr. Zhu's spirit of struggle and learning. We should learn from Mr. Zhu and continue Mr. Zhu's spirit, personality, and career to complete China's difficult and hard revolutionary work. Now the political situation in the north has fallen into total collapse, and the elimination of the rebels Yan Feng and Wang is no longer a problem. However, how to build a new Republic of China after the reactionary forces are eliminated, how to realize the Prime Minister's will, and how to relieve the suffering of the Chinese people in the era of suffering. I hope that all comrades and representatives from all walks of life present at today's memorial service for Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom should deeply reflect and make real efforts. The report is over.</p>
<h3>Representative Speeches</h3>
<p>Tao Baichuan said in his speech, "Fellow comrades, today is the tenth anniversary of Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom. We are holding a meeting today to commemorate him. I believe that not only are we in Shanghai holding a meeting to commemorate him, but also all places in the country where the Kuomintang's power reaches are holding meetings to commemorate him. Not only are we commemorating him now, but also in the past, since Mr. Zhu Zhixin's martyrdom, everyone who knows Mr. Zhu has been commemorating him. Not only is this true in the past and present, but I believe that in the future, twenty weeks later, I believe that commemorating Mr. Zhu and mourning Mr. Zhu will definitely be more and more enthusiastic. There have been many people who sacrificed for the country in the past, but why do we commemorate Mr. Nian so enthusiastically? The reasons for this have been reported in detail by the chairman in the past, and the spirit, career, and personality of Mr. Zhu have been introduced in detail and succinctly. I would like to raise a point to explain in detail. I think the reason why Mr. Zhu is worthy of our commemoration is the word 'public' in the world. Mr. Zhu's lifelong career was for the public, and Mr. Zhu's death was also for the public. Death is not a strange thing. We will never commemorate him because Mr. Zhu died so tragically. At the same time, Mr. Zhu was always prepared to die when he wrote articles and spoke in his life, because a revolutionary party member had already determined the fate of death when he stepped on the revolutionary front. Death is not strange. Of course, we don't have to commemorate Mr. Zhu because he died so tragically. We commemorate Mr. Zhu because Mr. Zhu did not die for personal gain, for fame and fortune, or for sensual pleasures. He died entirely for the public, so he deserves our admiration. The ninth year of the Republic of China happened to be the end of the European War. In the four years from the fourth year of the Republic of China to the eighth year of the Republic of China, international imperialists, except for Japan, were busy fighting among themselves and had no time to take care of China. However, by the ninth year of the Republic of China, the European War had ended, and the imperialists, when they were exhausted and economically exhausted, tried their best to invade China and wanted to compensate for all their losses during the European War in China. Therefore, their invasion and oppression were ten or a hundred times more fierce than before. Mr. Sun Yat-sen witnessed this dangerous situation and knew that to resist the powers and resist the oppression of the imperialists, there must be a strong and unified government. However, at that time, the Northern Warlords were arrogant and wanted to resist the powers by calling on the warlords, which was tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger and was absolutely impossible. The South was relatively hopeful, so Mr. Sun Yat-sen decided to make Guangdong a revolutionary base and sent Mr. Zhu to Guangzhou to contact the people's groups and organize the masses, wanting to drive out the warlords of the Gui系 in Guangzhou. Therefore, Mr. Zhu died at the hands of the warlords. Therefore, Mr. Zhu's death was to save the country from collapse, to save the nation from danger, and to relieve the suffering of the people. In short, Mr. Zhu died for the public. Therefore, Mr. Zhu's death is very different from the death of ordinary people. Now the Kuomintang's power has spread throughout the country, and the number of Kuomintang members has also increased compared to before. However, how many people can live and die for the public like Mr. Zhu? Take Shanghai as an example. How many comrades in Shanghai can strive for the public and sacrifice for the public like Mr. Zhu? Shanghai is the place where the oppression and invasion of imperialism are most obvious. However, we ask ourselves whether every civilian in Shanghai understands, is used to, and is ready to struggle and sacrifice with the imperialists. Even if they understand the oppression of the imperialists and are determined to fight to the death with the imperialists, how many can there be? Let's take the boycott of foreign goods as an example. How many civilians can firmly and eternally extend their determination to boycott? The weakness of this national consciousness and the collapse of the national spirit is because everyone only knows about private matters and doesn't know about public matters. When it comes to national affairs, many people criticize the authorities for being wrong and making mistakes. If you ask him to help the government and do something, he will decline politely and slip away. Shunmin saves the country, it's not my business, there are Zhou Gong and Confucius. These two lines of poetry describe the attitude of our people towards national affairs, which can be said to be very accurate. This shows that the people of our country only know how to curse and sing high-pitched tunes, but they will not actually work hard to do it. The reason for this is that everyone only knows about private matters and doesn't know about public matters. The domestic disasters are so serious, and the suffering of the victims crying for food is not something we can describe. However, rich people would rather eat and drink, watch movies, go to gambling casinos, visit dance halls, and do all kinds of other sensual things. If you want him to donate money to help the victims, he is willing to pull out a hair to benefit the world. This is a manifestation of only knowing about private matters and not knowing about public matters. How many people die in Shanghai every day? Many rich and wealthy people are killed by bandits. Many bandits die for bandit cases. Many people commit suicide because they fail to steal women, as well as many other people who die for sensual pleasures and fame and fortune. Not only do we not give them the slightest sympathy or regret for the deaths of these people, but we also denounce and curse them. The reason for this is that they died for private gain and not for the public. Therefore, today we commemorate Mr. Zhu's martyrdom. First, we should learn from Mr. Zhu's spirit of dying for the public. Now it is the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, and it has been exactly ten years since Mr. Zhu's martyrdom in the ninth year of the Republic of China. Is the situation better than before? The oppression of imperialism is more and more serious, and the harassment of the reactionaries is still constant. The foundation of the National Government is still very fragile, and the foundation of the Republic of China is still very shaky. China in the era of suffering is still in need of people like Mr. Zhu who are for the country and the people, who live for the public and die for the public. We really feel very sad and empty. How many people in our party are like Mr. Zhu who are for the public? In addition to being afraid and trembling, how should we learn from Mr. Zhu's spirit, personality, and career to complete Mr. Zhu's unfinished business? If everyone still only knows about private matters, lives for private gain, and dies for private gain, then the country and the nation will certainly have no way to do it, and those who seek welfare for private gain will also be limited to the fate of destruction, because China needs people like Mr. Zhu who are dedicated to the public. Therefore, I will contribute this point to you. The speech is over.</p>

<h3>Municipal Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Responding to the Qiao Dian from Liao and Zhang</p>
<p>Deeply Hope to Advocate and Practice</p>
<p>To Set an Example for the World</p>
<p>The Municipal Executive Committee replied to Zhang Xueliang's telegram yesterday (titles omitted): "Upon reading the Qiao Dian, the sincerity of advocating peace and attempting to build the country and save the people is evident in the words. We are extremely pleased and admire it. However, peace and construction must strictly abide by the Prime Minister's will and first plan to unify under the central government. Since last year, if the comrades in all directions can follow what is said in Your Excellency's telegram, they should all wait quietly for the central government to make arrangements, then peace can be realized early and construction can be planned. Unexpectedly, Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang abandoned the Prime Minister's will and betrayed the central government, and their eloquence was like reeds, inciting and engaging in affairs. At first, they made excuses for courtesy and mutual coercion, stepping down and placing the country's difficulties and the people's suffering out of consideration. Then, they used the name of convening a national conference and formulating a constitution to call on the remnants of warlords, reactionary officials, speculative politicians, and traitors of our party to jointly plot to destroy the compilation, disrupt peace, cancel the training, and destroy party rule, not hesitating to use force to invade the south and vainly attempt to overthrow the central government. Relying on the loyalty and bravery of our central government soldiers to kill the enemy and destroy its main force, and when the plan failed, they retreated and colluded with the like of Wang Jingwei and Xie Chi to convene an illegal enlarged meeting and establish a pseudo-government in Peiping, first planning to occupy it and then planning to harass it, colluding with the Communist Party in Hunan and Jiangxi and local bandits in the southeast to corrupt the local area as a trick. If Qingfu is not eliminated, the difficulties in Lu will not end, and the people's livelihood will be haggard, and the crime is attributed to you. Now, for the sake of realizing peace and promoting unification, the general leads the brave soldiers of the Northeast to directly attack Pingjin and joins forces with the central government soldiers in Henan and Shandong to encircle the rebels. It is expected that the rebels can be eliminated in the shortest period of time and the roots of the disaster can be eradicated forever. As for the resolution of national affairs and all major plans, they should all wait quietly for the central government to make arrangements, as Your Excellency said in the telegram. From now on, all our revolutionary soldiers and wise men at home and abroad will have the same idea, learning from the mistakes of the Yan, Feng, Wang, and Xie generations, realizing that betraying the central government is the path to self-destruction, and being able to express their great opinions on the long-term peace and stability policy and wait quietly for the central government to adopt them, then not only can the difficulties of the times be overcome and the swords and guns can be stopped forever, but also the suffering of the people can be relieved and the international status can be enhanced, which can be advanced in an orderly manner without being empty talk. We deeply hope that the general will advocate and practice it and set an example for the world. The party and the country are fortunate, and the people are fortunate. The telegram is far away, and we cannot help but look forward to it. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee, stamp."</p>

It was resolved that the association would donate 600 yuan annually from July of the 19th year to the end of June of the 20th year, and the case was handed over to the executive and supervisory committees for handling. (B) Should the representatives attending the National Lawyers Association be re-elected? Member Li Shirui stood up and reported that the Lawyers Association was scheduled to hold a general meeting in Hangzhou in April of next year to re-elect the representatives. It was too early to re-elect the representatives. The re-election should be discussed at the spring meeting next year. The resolution was passed. (C) Qu Yue, Wang Chenggu, Liang Dihua, Chen Tingrui, and other sixteen people proposed that there was no need to divide the lawyer's rest room in the Shanghai Special District Local Court under the current situation.</p>

<h3>Reduced Train Fares for Cooperative Society Members</h3>
<p>The traffic departments of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways yesterday issued a notice to station masters and ticket sellers at all stations, stating: "Recently, we received an order from the Railway Administration, which in turn received an order from the Ministry of Railways approving a letter from the Chinese Cooperative Society stating that the society will hold a meeting in Hangzhou from October 3rd to 19th, and requesting that all participating members be given half-price fares as a convenience."  Enclosed are 50 copies each of the member list and sample travel passes.  The Ministry has granted a convenience and approved a 25% discount for one-way tickets and a 50% discount for round-trip tickets.  However, this must be handled in accordance with the fare reduction restrictions of each railway. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are also sending 25 copies each of the original list and sample travel passes.  You are to comply with this order and instruct the stations to verify the society's certificates and exchange them for train tickets, collecting fares accordingly."</p>
<p>Upon investigation, there are approximately 120 members of the society who will be traveling from Beijing, Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, Shanghai North Station, Shanghai South Station, and Songjiang to attend the meeting in Hangzhou within the specified period.  Each member will exchange their certificate at the respective station for a round-trip ticket at half the ordinary fare. The minimum first-class fare is $1.00 per person, second-class is $0.75, and third-class is $0.50. However, these fares do not apply to express trains on the two lines. If passengers need to take the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's night express trains 27 and 28, or the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's train 49, additional fares must be charged. You are to comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Scope of Application of the Land Expropriation Law</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Issues Orders to Respective Departments to Comply</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government recently received an instruction from the Executive Yuan, stating roughly: "Based on a case presented by the Civil Affairs Department of this government, approved by the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, concerning the Nanjing Special Municipality Executive Committee forwarding a petition from the First Branch of the Tenth District requesting the government to issue a general order to all agencies that when expanding office buildings and constructing staff dormitories, they may not invoke the Land Expropriation Law to expropriate land from the people.  The current explanation of the Land Expropriation Law allows for the expropriation of land for the construction of office buildings by various customs offices.  However, it does not seem applicable to the construction of staff dormitories.  It is forwarded for review and implementation." It was approved that "The use of the Land Expropriation Law to expropriate land from the people for the use of customs office staff dormitories is indeed inappropriate.  A general order should be sent to the National Government instructing all agencies that they may not use the construction of dormitories as a pretext to expropriate land from the people." In addition to replying, we have copied the original petition and forwarded it for your information and hope you will forward it for handling. We approve this proposal and instruct you to handle it accordingly. In addition to replying, we are also issuing orders to the departments and agencies within the city to comply.</p>
<h3>Yesterday</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese from Malaya Return to China, Arriving in Shanghai</p>
<p>Five from Hunan and Hubei</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Xinjiang steamship arrived from Hong Kong yesterday, carrying five elderly and frail overseas Chinese from the Malay Peninsula, originally from Hunan and Hubei provinces.  They described the reasons for returning to their homeland, stating that since the price of tin fell in the Malay Peninsula, unemployment among overseas Chinese has been increasing. While the strong can support themselves, the elderly and frail have nowhere to find food.  This group consists of more than 160 people, mostly from Guangdong and Fujian, who were assisted by the consulate in Penang and the Ping Foon Association for repatriation by the Chinese Civil Affairs Department.  After a medical examination, they were deemed incapable of labor and boarded the "Mountain Chu" ship in early September, arriving in Hong Kong and then transferring to the "Xinjiang" ship to Shanghai. They will return to their native provinces today. "We have been away from our hometowns for more than thirty years, and we are very pleased to see the scenery of our motherland today. The rapid progress of various industries in the motherland makes it seem like another world."</p>

<h3>The Xinhua Bank Extraordinary General Meeting of Shareholders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xinhua Commercial Savings Bank held an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders at the Bankers' Association. The meeting opened at 2:00 PM. 114 account holders participated representing 12,580 shares. Mr. Lin Kanghou was elected chairman. The meeting began with a report from the General Manager concerning matters after the prior shareholder meeting regarding the Central and Communications Bank and their audits of the bank. The Board of Directors then proposed the following motions: 1) old shares would be reduced to one-tenth of their prior value; 2) new shares would be issued; 3) the Central and Communications Bank would appoint representatives to oversee the bank's business before the new shares had been fully subscribed. The chairman then put the motions to a vote which was approved by a large majority. It is understood that the Central and Communications Bank are already large shareholders in the bank. Now that the banks will oversee all of Xinhua's business, the Xinhua's external credit will be further strengthened and its business development is naturally to be expected.</p>
<h3>The National Walking Corps</h3>
<p>The Reason for Temporarily Suspending Progress</p>
<p>The National Walking Corps has been on its way for nearly half a year since its departure, and after several setbacks, it finally arrived in Xianghe County, Hebei Province, a month ago. Due to the impact of the current situation, it could not move forward and had to temporarily suspend its progress to await an opportunity to continue. Now, the members of the Corps have returned to Shanghai in order, and during this period of suspension, they will organize the records of the journey over the past six months for publication, and their photos will also be developed and put on public display. Yesterday, the Corps issued a special circular detailing the process and the reasons for the temporary suspension. We have selected the key points to record below: "We spent more than six months, through the howling wind and scorching sun, walking to Peiping after many twists and turns. Unfortunately, we encountered unexpected obstacles in Peiping. However, our courage will not be diminished in the slightest. We still moved forward regardless, but unfortunately we could not pass through Xianghe (Hebei) and were forced to temporarily suspend our work. We set out from Shanghai to Nanjing, and went up the Huai River to the East China Sea. Our original plan was to travel through Suqian and Muyang to Xuzhou. When we came down from Yuntai Mountain, war clouds were already looming over the Jinpu Railway Line and bandits were rampant in eastern Shandong, so we had to change our plan. We reluctantly took a boat from Xinpu to Qingdao, planning to go to Jinan via the Jiaoji Railway and then along the Jinpu Railway to Tianjin. We heard that the northern section of the Jinpu Railway was still calm, but on the fourth day after we arrived in Qingdao, the Central Army abandoned Jinan and the situation changed suddenly, becoming more tense than before. Therefore, the motive to take the Jinpu Railway had to be abandoned, so we decided to abandon Shandong, leaving it to be visited later. We took a boat from Qingdao to Tianjin, preparing to go out through the Beining Railway. When we contacted the Beining Railway Bureau to ask them to transport our luggage, a section chief advised us, saying that the current situation is not good, and that people will suspect you Southerners for coming here, and the garrison may misunderstand and not understand, which could cause unexpected dangers. Moreover, you cannot do any survey work at this time, which would be futile. Furthermore, there are many bandits along the line, and the trains still need armed guards. You should consider it carefully. We were very grateful for the section chief's sincere guidance, so we decided to go to Peiping first during this military period and ask the provincial government to issue a certificate of proof, which might be more convenient than explaining to the local military and police with empty words. Who knew that as soon as we arrived in Peiping, we lost our freedom of action. The military and police authorities could not understand our undertaking. They did not know what we seven or eight unfamiliar Southerners were doing. No matter how much you talked, they would not understand. Later, we finally got released through a series of connections, but they were always uneasy. After staying in Peiping for a long time, the war was still fierce and the Beining Railway was washed away by floods. We received a tour passport and immediately prepared to pass through Tongzhou, Sanhe, Yutian, etc. and exit Shanhaiguan regardless of everything. Unexpectedly, we were stopped as soon as we arrived in Tongzhou, so we turned to Xianghe, but we could not pass through either. The hotels in the county town dared not accommodate us, and the military and police secretly monitored our actions. We could not get freedom of action, let alone go to the countryside to conduct on-the-spot investigations. At this time, we could have gone directly to the three northeastern provinces or changed our route to the south, but during this unstable period, our work would inevitably make people suspicious. Even if the authorities could understand, the public would be frightened and would suspect that we had some purpose and would not be willing to talk to us. Therefore, we finally temporarily suspended our progress. This is the phenomenon we have experienced since our departure. When we recall the expectations of the people in Shanghai and the support and sympathy expressed by people in various places along the way, we are very ashamed. However, this group of ours will never collapse. Our courage is still as strong as before, and we will never be discouraged. We recognize that the past is an attempt, a failure that has increased a lot of our experience. As soon as the overall situation stabilizes, we will continue our second effort. If the second time is unsuccessful, we will try three or four times until we finally complete our original plan to live up to the expectations of society. During this period of suspension, we can complete the following two tasks: 1. Organize the materials collected from various places and attach them to the departure commemorative album; 2. Develop the photos, attach detailed explanations, and display them together with the specimens in public, and hope that people from all walks of life and enthusiastic comrades will participate. The mailing address is still No. 608, Rue P. Froc."</p>
<h3>Jewish Residents to Celebrate New Year</h3>
<p>This Month the 23rd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Tuesday (the 23rd) marks the beginning of the Jewish year 5691. Jewish people around the world will celebrate starting on Monday evening. Local synagogues in the area will also hold a ceremony. Tradition holds that this day commemorates God's creation of the world 5690 years ago.</p>
<h3>Wusong Anti-Smuggling Captain on Patrol</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the unrest among pirates in the outer seas, Li Huchen, captain of the first anti-smuggling detachment of Wusong, led team captain Gao Song and the team on ten patrol boats from Wusong at about 7:00 AM yesterday. They first patrolled the islands of Hengsha and Yawo Sha, and then went up the river to patrol Liuhe, Fushan, Hupu, Baimao and other places, and inspected the defenses of the teams stationed in various locations. It will take about a week to return to Wusong for defense.</p>
<h3>Shaanxi Province Appeals for Aid Due to Recent Disasters</h3>
<p>Jisheng Society Reports Successive Testimonies</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has repeatedly received letters from Liu, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government via the Chang'an Branch of Shaanxi Province. The letter states that "In Shaanxi, the disasters of soldiers, bandits, famine and devastation have multiplied, and the deaths are overwhelming. The disaster situation is unprecedented since ancient times. Fortunately, the gentlemen of your society have a compassionate heart and can generously help the people. The kindness of life and death permeates the surviving. This is not only the gratitude of millions of Taian people who are waiting to die, but also the joint praise of me and my colleagues, and we will never forget your great virtue. However, it is difficult to reverse the will of Heaven, and the calamity has not ended. In addition, locusts are causing havoc, and the disaster has lasted for three years. If it were not for your society's multi-faceted rescue, could we hope that there would still be survivors? We hope that you will continue to provide assistance to complete the work." We have also received telegrams from the Shaanxi disaster victims' representatives, stating that "The great disaster has not ended, and locusts, wolves and rats continue to cause havoc. More than 4 million disaster victims have died in ditches due to plague and hunger. Fortunately, your society's rescue has slightly reduced the deaths, but the autumn is dry and locusts are followed by wind and hail. There is no hope for a harvest, and the survivors are waiting to die. We ask you to publicize the appeal and quickly raise relief funds to reduce the catastrophe to a minimum." After investigating the situation of the disaster in Shaanxi, which has been recorded in previous reports, the situation has become even worse recently, according to reports. The society is currently setting up disaster victim and disaster child shelters in Shaanxi Province to provide emergency relief. However, the disaster is great and the funds are small, so how can this help? We can only appeal to compatriots to join hands for assistance. Life and death are at stake, and we hope for the ultimate blessing. Millions of disaster victims are enduring death and leading the way to wait.</p>
<h3>Game Hall Tickets Must Have Stamps Affixed</h3>
<p>Wang and Guan, directors of the Jiangsu Province Stamp Tax Bureau and the Customs Bureau, are very serious about handling stamp duties in the concessions. Merchants in the concessions who have failed to affix stamps have been investigated and fined in the Special District Local Court because the Municipal Council has agreed to provide assistance. More than twenty households were fined last Saturday. Now, Wang and Guan believe that the tickets sold at theaters and game halls in the Public Concession must also have stamps affixed. Tickets with a value of more than one corner must have a one-cent stamp affixed. Since the tickets for the "Fairy World" are worth only one corner, they are exempt from stamps. Therefore, "Hua Hua World" has also reduced the price of its tickets to one corner recently. Other game halls have not been able to reduce their prices due to high expenses and would rather comply with the regulations and purchase stamps. However, the Beijing Opera theaters are still in consultation. It is said that the Beijing Opera theaters are willing to wholesale a certain number of stamps every day, while the tax bureau insists on purchasing stamps for each ticket. Each party has its own reasons, so negotiations are still underway.</p>
<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the Five-Neighborhood Joint Association of Tenants</h3>
<p>Since the landlord of the tenants in the five neighborhoods of Ximen Road in the French Concession announced a rent increase, the tenants, considering the economic depression and the hardship of the people's livelihood, found it difficult to bear the sudden increase in rent. Therefore, they organized a tenants' association to negotiate with the landlord to cancel the rent increase. The tenants convened a second meeting at the original location at 7:00 PM the day before yesterday. Fifty-six people attended. Chairman Liu Yunsheng reported on the landlord's lawyer's reply. After the tenants expressed their opinions, they decided on the following countermeasures: 1. Refute the landlord's lawyer's reply with reason; 2. All tenants unite to reject the rent increase; 3. Petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, the Tenants' General Federation and other organizations to uphold justice and provide assistance; 4. Pay all October rent at the original amount. If the landlord does not accept it, deposit it in the bank to avoid the landlord using it as an excuse; 5. The association will produce slogans and distribute them to the members to post to show the spirit of unity and promote the landlord's awareness; 6. All expenses will be borne by all; 7. Hire a lawyer as the legal advisor of the association. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Address Change for the Party Headquarters of the Two Railways</h3>
<p>The Party Headquarters of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, which has been located at No. 257 Bazilu, has been repeatedly requested to relocate because the Railway Bureau is going to convert the building into a hospital, and has separately designated No. 1392 North Sichuan Road (next to the Tiantong'an Station) as the new office address. Therefore, the Party Headquarters moved on the 20th. It is rumored that the building is very spacious and the air is quite clean, but the portion allocated is too small and there is still a lack of auditorium, so it needs to be contacted with the Railway Bureau again.</p>
<h3>News from Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Sausage Industry: The Sausage Industry Trade Association held its 12th executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Chairman Ye Jiaxing: 1.

Discuss the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's reply to the petition of the trade association for approval of the rules and regulations. It should be followed by members who have not joined the association. The wording in the reply to the Executive Yuan is not only unclear about the commercial situation, but also contradicts the main purpose of Article 2 of the promulgated Trade Association Law. It is feared that the drafter has overlooked it. If the trade association does not clarify this major mistake and achieve the purpose of approval, the trade association will inevitably disintegrate. What method should be used to remedy this setback? It was decided to ask the various trade associations to petition the National Government Executive Yuan to order the ministry to review the matter. C. Commander Zhang's troops marched to Pingjin to promote unification, support the central government, and the domestic industry and commerce can be expected to be restored. Should this association send a special telegram of condolence? It was decided to send a special telegram of condolence. D. Should the City Chamber of Commerce be asked to compile and issue the addresses of the trade associations for communication purposes? It was decided to submit a request to the City Chamber of Commerce to compile and issue the addresses. E. This association's members lack contact with each other and are very isolated in business. Should a date be set for a discussion meeting to seek contact and seek business benefits? It was decided to hold a member discussion meeting this Sunday afternoon. (Omitted)</p>

It was decided to send Wu Lianyi to actively collect the fees with the collectors. 3. Members Zhu Hongxing, Sun Shuntai, etc. were bullied and requested assistance. It was decided to send Wu Lianyi to investigate and handle the matter. New Drug Industry: The New Drug Industry Trade Association held its executive committee meeting yesterday. Chairman Huang Chujiu decided on the following cases: 1.

Fortunately, the Shanghai Special District Court sentenced Wan Gui and two accomplices to two years and six months of imprisonment based on the facts, and rejected all the accusations of framing him. This was not only because Mr. Li was able to keep the peace and protect himself and was not easily harmed by villains, but also because the court was fair and honest. Yesterday, the association sent a letter of thanks and notified all members to show encouragement.</p>

<h3>Famous Doctor of Hongkou</h3>
<p>Zhu Ziyun is Kidnapped</p>
<p>Kidnappers Drag Zhu Out of the Door</p>
<p>In Haste, He Couldn't Even Put on His Shoes</p>
<p>Waiting Patients Were All Amazed</p>
<p>Zhu Suffers from Diabetes and Hasn't Eaten for a Long Time</p>
<p>The Throat Specialist's Practice is Always Crowded</p>
<p>Dr. Zhu Ziyun, a throat specialist famous in Hongkou, suddenly had his residence tightly closed yesterday afternoon. No one was there, and a note was posted on the door saying, "Temporarily closed for business." Zhu's accountant, Qi Gai, posted the note. This famous doctor of Hongkou, Zhu Ziyun, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits from his consulting room at around 11:00 AM yesterday. In such a hurry, not only did his brother, who was sitting across from him, not have time to say goodbye, but he didn't even have time to put on his shoes. Such an embarrassing situation was truly unexpected. The house has three layers of doors. The famous doctor Zhu Ziyun is the son of Zhu Baoqing, a throat specialist from a long line of doctors. He and his brother Zhongyun run a clinic together at 3151 Zhoujiazui Road. Even women and children in the Hongkou area know of his reputation. It is said that he sees around 150 patients every day. At most, he sees 180, 190, or even 200 patients. There are very few famous doctors in Shanghai who can compare to him. Zhu's consulting room is located in the main hall. Entering through the main gate, you first pass through the wall gate, then the courtyard, and then the main hall. Every day, hundreds of patients are here. They receive Zhu Ziyun's pulse-taking, tongue examination, prescription, and medication. The house faces south, and Zhu sits facing north, with patients on his left and a doorman on his right. He takes pulses and prescribes medication. Anyone who enters must first see Mr. Zhu's back, nod, and bow among the patients.</p>
<h3>Brothers Sitting Across from Each Other</h3>
<p>Because Zhu has too many patients every day and is mentally exhausted, his brother Zhongyun assists with the clinic's affairs. His seat is set up across from Zhu. The brothers sit together at one table. Yesterday morning, Zhu Ziyun was already in the consulting room seeing patients at around 8:00 AM. By about 11:00 AM, there were still 30 to 40 people waiting to be seen, so there were many people entering and exiting. At that time, three men suddenly entered through the main gate and went straight into the main hall, without registering or asking any questions.</p>
<h3>Dragging Zhu Out</h3>
<p>These three men walked up behind Zhu. One of them said, "I'm sorry for today." Before Zhu could turn around, two of them grabbed him and pointed three guns at him. Zhu didn't even have time to put on his shoes before being dragged out of his seat straight towards the main gate. Zhu's brother Zhongyun was greatly shocked to see his brother suddenly leave his seat, and the patients in the room were also surprised. It wasn't until Zhu got into the car that everyone realized that these were kidnappers who had come to kidnap him. The news of Zhu Ziyun's kidnapping instantly spread throughout the streets. Since Zhu had suffered misfortune, his brother Zhongyun also temporarily closed the clinic. All the patients had no choice but to withdraw their tickets and get their consultation fees back.</p>
<h3>Travelers Rent a Car</h3>
<p>An hour before Zhu Ziyun was kidnapped, Chen Xiaonan, a traveler from Zhenhua Hotel at 68 Guangxi Road, rented car number 17625 from Haoyou Automobile Company. This car was used to kidnap Zhu. Previously, a traveler claiming to be Chen Xiaonan from Ningbo arrived at Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road at around 5:00 PM on the 19th and rented room number 68. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, he ordered the room service to rent a car from Haoyou Automobile Company to take him to Bazilu. The room service walked to Haoyou Automobile Company to rent the car. The accountant ordered the driver Lu Asi to drive the Chevrolet car number 17625 (Municipal 4574) to the customer.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Watching the Land</h3>
<p>Lu drove the car to the entrance of Zhenhua Hotel, and a man in his thirties wearing a khaki robe opened the door and got in. Just as he was about to drive off, another person came forward, greeted the person in the car briefly, and also got in. They instructed the driver to drive to Bazilu, turn onto Jiangwan Road, and stop near Zhizhi University. Two other people were already waiting by the side of the road. They walked into the fields to look at the land. Who knew that in a turn, the driver Lu Asi was suddenly dragged out of the driver's seat by two people and dragged into the graveyard. His mouth was stuffed with cotton to prevent him from making any noise, while the other two people stole the car. About an hour later, the driver managed to escape and ran back to Shanghai to report. By this time, Zhu Ziyun had already been kidnapped. Car number 1762 was found in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Zhu Ziyun</h3>
<p>After stealing this car, the bandits drove it to Zhoujiazui Road to kidnap Zhu Ziyun. After getting the "God of Wealth," the car drove west towards Sikaizi Bridge and disappeared in an instant. Zhu developed diabetes last autumn and has been suffering from it for a long time. He has not recovered to this day. Following the advice of Western doctors, he has stopped eating rice. He only eats noodles and other foods instead. Therefore, after being kidnapped, he is afraid that the food in the bandit's den will not be adequate and will harm his health.</p>
<h3>Two Gunshots</h3>
<p>The Chauffeur is in Grave Danger</p>
<p>Both Bullets Hit the Car</p>
<p>Li Hanqing, a 47-year-old employee of Yitai Foreign Firm at 60 Jiangxi Road and a native of Suzhou, lives at 9 Caishou Lane, Julai Road, in the French Concession. Because Li's affairs are numerous, he purchased car number 1571 to replace walking and rented garage number 412 along the road. He hired a local driver, Xu Xinbao, 32 years old. Xu has only been working for Li since last autumn, not yet a year, and his pure and honest nature has earned him the owner's trust. Li usually has many social engagements and often returns late at night. At 12:15 yesterday morning, Li had just finished a banquet and returned home. The driver Xu Xinbao drove the car directly into the alley. The owner got out of the car and went inside. Xu then slowly reversed the car out of the alleyway, with the front of the car facing west, intending to drive the car into the parking garage. Just as he reached the entrance, two gunshots suddenly rang out from the east. One bullet hit the seat Xu was sitting on, and the other hit the left side of the car door. The aim seemed to be to hit Xu, but fortunately, it missed. After the thugs fired the shots, they assumed that Xu had been hit and fled. Seeing that they were far away, Xu quickly got out of the car and rushed to report to the owner. He examined his body and found no injuries. He immediately reported the situation to the police station. The detective immediately ordered the plainclothes detectives to investigate. After carefully inspecting the bullet holes in the car body, they reported back to the detective that there might be other circumstances involved. The police station is currently investigating. However, Li immediately fired Xu yesterday.</p>
<h3>Old Man Missing in Zhangyan</h3>
<p>Suffering from a Hidden Illness and Mental Disorder</p>
<p>Left the Hospital and Disappeared</p>
<p>Tang Shaoru, an old man from Zhangyan, Jinshan, is 77 years old. He is usually in good health and walks briskly. He has children and some assets and is considered well-off. Although he is old, he is still diligent and thrifty, and he still travels to Shanghai to engage in his cotton yarn business. At the beginning of August, he came to Shanghai from his hometown to negotiate business and temporarily stayed at a friend's place in the French Concession. Later, he suddenly developed a hidden illness in his lower body. On August 11, he was introduced by a friend to Dr. Shen Huimin, a female doctor at Ankang Lane, Yunnan Road, in the Public Concession, and was hospitalized for treatment. It has been more than a month. Although his illness is about to be cured, Tang, being so old, was unfortunately victimized by this disease. Suffering unexpectedly, he became depressed day and night, which led to mental disorder. On the afternoon of the 16th of this month, at about 7:30 PM, Tang suddenly left the hospital. At the time, it was suspected that he might have returned to his hometown as his illness was getting better. However, it was not until his family members came to Shanghai to visit him a few days ago that they learned that the old man had indeed disappeared. They immediately searched everywhere, but there was no trace of him. Yesterday, his family members reported to the Chinese and Public Concessions, requesting the police to pay attention to the matter. They are also offering a reward to find the old man. He was wearing a double blue twill short jacket, willow-striped cloth pants, white gauze socks, and black shoes. He is bald and has white hair. If anyone knows of his whereabouts, please contact Mr. Lu at 23 Shengping Lane, Dada Road.</p>
<h3>Big Fire on Xiexu Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Spreading to More Than Ten Households</p>
<p>Lasting for More Than Two Hours</p>
<p>At 8:10 AM yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Zhang Xintang, a resident of No. 12, Alley 2, Deyun Lane, Xiexu Road, Nanshi. The fire brigades from various districts in Nanshi rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm. However, due to insufficient water pressure, the fire spread to ten households, lasting for two hours and fifty minutes. It was not until 11:05 AM that the fire was extinguished. The ten affected households were: No. 10 (Zhang A'ping, Tao Jiying, Sun A'yuan, Jin Shibiao), No. 11 (Cai Jinxiu, Wei A'xing, Shao Xiangzhou), No. 12 (Zhou Zhizeng), No. 13 (Lian Guangrong, Gao Lin, Song Rongfa, Hu Yuqing), No. 14 (Wan A'gen, Jin Shengcai, Jin Zijing), No. 29 (Chen Songlin, Zhou Anren, Shen Guo'shi, Han Heng),</p>
<p>The Dongjiadu Fire Brigade took photos while putting out the fire.</p>
<p>Shan Hu, Yun Shan, Chen Zhifan, No. 30 (Yu Rufa, Yuan Haiqing, Chen Yunqing, Zhang Jinxi, Wang Zifu, Chen Zuliang), No. 31 (Wang Jinshan, Chen A'mao, Xie Shaobo, Huang Weibiao), No. 32 (Wang Honggen), No. 33 (Zhou A'chen, Zhao Yingquan, Lu Guiquan), No. 34 (Sun Heshang, Zhao Keheng), etc., totaling 37 households. Gao Shiqiang, the inspector of the Second District Headquarters, arrived with several police officers to maintain order. Upon further investigation into the cause of the fire, the perpetrator had already fled in fear of punishment. Only Zhang's apprentice, Chen Tianfu, was detained at the headquarters. His statement was incoherent, and the cause of the fire was unclear. Furthermore, Chen's head was severely burned. The police were immediately ordered to send him to the hospital for treatment. The perpetrator, Zhang Xintang, is being strictly pursued for questioning.</p>
<h3>Cholera Outbreaks Worsen After the Autumn Cool</h3>
<p>Cholera was rare this summer, but dysentery was particularly prevalent, especially the bacterial type. Since the beginning of autumn, although dysentery has decreased, cholera has worsened. It is reported that the emergency epidemic hospital on North Xizang Road has been admitting many patients with cholera in recent days, and the number of saline injections given daily is invariably eight or nine people, totaling no less than several dozen people in the past few days. The ambulances are busy transporting patients back and forth.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit After the Liquidation of Yuansheng Money Exchange</h3>
<p>Partners Should Bear Unlimited Liability</p>
<p>Xia Juchuan Denies the Liquidation Terms</p>
<p>The Yuansheng Money Exchange, opened by Zhang Xingcun, a former compradore of Meifeng Bank, and others, has declared liquidation due to business losses. However, Xia Juchuan, a creditor of the exchange, believes that Yuansheng is a partnership and not a limited liability company, and should bear unlimited liability. He is unwilling to accept the liquidation terms. It is learned that the shareholders of the exchange were summoned by the Special District Local Court. The hearing continued the other day. The defendant Zhang Xingcun was represented by lawyers Zhang Deqin and Shen Yuesheng. However, because many of the defendants did not comply with the summons and did not appear in court, the hearing could not proceed. The judge instructed to summon the defendants to appear in court for further review.</p>
<h3>Zhu Suzhen</h3>
<p>Accuses Kong Jingqing of Failing to Provide Support</p>
<p>Kong Denies Taking Zhu as a Concubine</p>
<p>And Denies Having a Son</p>
<p>Kong Jingqing is fond of frequenting brothels. When he was working at the shop established by his father-in-law, he took the prostitute Zhu Suzhen as a concubine and hid her in a golden house on Dagu Road, without spending a penny on her dowry. After living together, he began to give her 200 yuan per month for household expenses. Zhu's decision to become a virtuous woman was due to her pregnancy after getting to know Kong. Before long, she gave birth to a son. However, Kong Suzhen was ungrateful and abandoned her after living together for a year. He stopped paying her household expenses and never visited Zhu's place again. Zhu had no choice but to take her child and rely on her mother for a living. Three years passed by, and the child grew up. Zhu realized that the days ahead were long, and she needed to solve the problems of her own livelihood and her son's education. Therefore, she demanded that Kong bear the responsibility of providing support. Kong denied taking Zhu as a concubine and denied that the child was his. Zhu then hired a lawyer to sue Kong in the Special District Local Court for abandonment and neglect, requesting a ruling to provide 20,000 yuan in alimony. After the initial hearing, the court ordered both parties to reconcile outside the court, but they were unable to reach a peaceful resolution. The case was heard again the other day. The defendant Kong Jingqing was unable to appear in court because he was suffering from severe lung disease and was being treated in the hospital. He sent a lawyer to represent him. The plaintiff Zhu Suzhen invited a female servant who was hired when she was a prostitute and a landlady surnamed, who was her landlord after she became Kong's concubine, to testify to everything that Kong had taken Zhu as a concubine that year. Judge Yang instructed to summon the defendant to appear in court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Cai Yunhai Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Cai Yunhai, the owner of the Cai Chen Import and Export Trading Company on Beijing Road, a native of Guangdong, was sued by a buyer because he failed to deliver the ordered foreign knives by the due date and did not return the deposit. The Special District Local Court summoned Cai and detained him in the civil detention center. However, Cai dared to escape by jumping out of the window late at night. Fearing that he would be wanted by the authorities, he surrendered himself to the prosecutor's office of the Special Court. Xu, the prosecutor, investigated the case together with the guards of the prison, Chen Jingcheng, etc. as previously reported. The investigation has now concluded, and it is believed that Cai and others are suspected of committing a crime. A public prosecution was filed. Xu, the prosecutor, stated that the defendant Cai Yunhai, on the 3rd of this month, at 3:00 AM, under the pretext of urinating, took the opportunity to escape by jumping out of the window. The next day, he surrendered himself again. Under investigation, the defendant also confessed, which constituted a crime under Article 170 of the Criminal Law. However, because the defendant surrendered himself afterward, he can reduce the original sentence by one-third according to Article 38 of the Criminal Law. As for Chen Jingcheng, who was in charge of guarding and had important responsibilities, he was unaware that the prisoner had escaped. His dereliction of duty is inexcusable and should be punished according to Article 172 of the Criminal Law. Judge Xu asked Cai Yunhai about the matter, and Cai repeatedly begged for mercy, saying that he had an old mother and children to support, and that his family relied on him for their livelihood. If he was convicted, his elderly mother and young children would lose their support. He pleaded for leniency. Under further cross-examination of Chen Jingcheng, the debate on the case concluded, and the sentencing was scheduled for next Thursday morning.</p>

<h3>Released from Prison for One Day and Night</h3>
<p>Re-arrested for Involvement in a Theft Case</p>
<p>Zhao Zhizhen Has Only Himself to Blame</p>
<p>Zhao Zhizhen, a native of Jiading, was sentenced to three months in prison by the Special District Local Court in June of this year for theft and was sent to the Tilanqiao Prison. He was released on the morning of the 18th of this month after serving his sentence and temporarily resided at 1025 Hede Road. In addition to his wife, Ms. Liu, his fellow villager Shen Liansheng also lived there. However, Zhao was only reunited with his family for one day and night. Suddenly, at 4:00 AM the next day, he was arrested by detectives from the Jing'an Temple Police Station, along with Ms. Liu and Shen. Recently, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested a local thief named Lu A'mao. According to Lu's confession, in July of the previous year, he and Zhao, Shen, etc., held weapons and robbed the household of Yangsi Bridge in Pudong. He also stated Zhao's address. The bureau sent detectives Han Ruisheng, etc., to the relevant police station with an official letter, requesting them to dispatch detectives to conduct a surprise arrest before dawn. They were all captured. At 9:00 AM, they were sent to the Special District Court. Detective Han presented the official document and requested a transfer order so that they could be returned to the case for interrogation. Police Barrister Wang Yaotang stated that the police station did not object to the transfer order. However, Zhao confessed that he was framed by enemies, and Shen and Ms. Liu both claimed to be unaware. After questioning, Judge Sun instructed to hand over the three men and women, Zhao Zhizhen, etc., to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>New New Hotel Receptionist</h3>
<p>Accuses the Manager and Others of Defaming His Reputation</p>
<p>Fired for Embezzling Public Funds</p>
<p>Actually Making False Accusations Out of Spite</p>
<p>Dai Bangzeng, a receptionist at the New New Company Hotel Department, has been working for many years. In May of this year, the company's manager, Li Minzhou, and associate Chen Yikang discovered that he was using public funds for private purposes and damaging the company's reputation, so they dismissed him. However, Dai did not repent and hired a lawyer to sue Li and Chen for defaming his reputation in the Special District Local Court, requesting that they be punished according to the law. He also filed a private suit demanding compensation for losses of 4,000 yuan. The other morning, Judge Sun Yuan held a hearing. The defendant hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to defend, saying that Dai had embezzled more than 430 yuan, so he was dismissed. Now he is suing for defamation, which is actually an attempt to blackmail. Therefore, the defendant has now decided to file a counterclaim requesting that he be punished for making false accusations. Before the judgment, he must be released on bail. He also submitted a list of the amounts of money that Dai had embezzled. Judge Sun asked the defendant, who admitted to using more than 300 yuan of public funds for private purposes. Judge Sun sternly reprimanded him, saying that since Dai had embezzled, how could he make false accusations out of spite? He then ordered him to pay 1,000 yuan in bail to await the verdict next Saturday.</p>
<h3>Meng Ju, a Woman's Divorce Case</h3>
<p>The Debate Has Concluded, Waiting for the Judgment</p>
<p>Meng Ju (i.e., Cui Meng'shi), a 39-year-old woman from Dongtai, resides at 144 Miezhu Street, Nanshi. Recently, she hired lawyer Hu Yuanjun to file a lawsuit in the Local Court for divorce. Her statement reads: The plaintiff's fate is unfortunate. In her youth, she was deceived by matchmakers into marrying the defendant Cui Baoqi. However, after she married, the defendant only had a few dilapidated houses, which he soon sold to pay off debts, which were still insufficient. Therefore, he sold all the houses and fields, leaving her with no home to return to. Before long, the plaintiff gave birth to a son and had no choice but to temporarily return to her mother's house to live a hard life. The defendant abandoned her from then on. For many years, the plaintiff and her mother had to come to Shanghai to work and make a living. However, the defendant repeatedly made false accusations in Dongtai County, implicating many people. The plaintiff handed him over to the defendant in court and ordered him not to abandon or abuse her. Unexpectedly, the defendant took the plaintiff to Suzhou and sold her three times. The plaintiff escaped back to her mother's house. Such a husband who has severed all ties, how can she live with him? Therefore, it has been six years since she was sold, and she has not received any news from him. She can only support her son's studies in order to make a living. The defendant saw that the plaintiff's mother had bought a few rickshaws, so he came to harass and seize them again. Since the defendant sold the plaintiff to Suzhou three times and abandoned her for six years, if he is allowed to enter the house and act recklessly again, he will surely squander all of the plaintiff's mother's assets. Therefore, she has no choice but to request that the divorce be granted. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo held a hearing. The defendant's address is unknown, so he could not be served. Lawyer Zhang Enhou was selected to appear in court to defend him. The plaintiff, Meng Ju, submitted a statement recounting the past events and requesting that the divorce be granted. Lawyer Hu also made a statement on her behalf. The judge then declared that the debate had concluded and that the judgment would be announced.</p>
<h3>Wu A'tu Died Tragically</h3>
<p>Heaved a Long Sigh and Tears Fell Like Rain</p>
<p>The Inside Story is Unknown</p>
<p>Wu A'tu, a local man, 24 years old, lived in the east end of Wu Family Hall, Pudong. He used to work as a substitute sailor on the Li Yongji steamship. He married Ms. So-and-so three years ago, and their relationship was extremely poor. It was rumored that A'tu's brother, A'lin (who worked as an old petrol ship supervisor), had an affair with his sister-in-law. A'tu felt increasingly unwelcome due to this gossip, but because he was weak, he did not dare to clarify the facts directly. Recently, his wife returned to her mother's house for several days. On the 19th, she returned home. The couple stayed together that night. Unexpectedly, the next morning (the day before), the sun was high in the sky, but the two had not yet gotten up. The neighbors were very suspicious and knocked on their door repeatedly. His wife finally opened the door, but her face was ashen and she did not say a word. The neighbors went inside and saw that A'tu was lying on his back on the bed, his face pale. He remained silent and did not make a sound. When someone asked him why he was like this, he heaved a long sigh and tears fell like rain. He still did not answer. Suddenly, a strange sound came from his throat, and his breathing became short. Before long, he died. The onlookers retreated in unison after witnessing this scene. Afterward, they ran around telling each other. Some said that he had committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills, while others said that the cause of his death was unexpected. Everyone was speculating, and many busybodies went to Wu's house to peek at the dead body, so the inside and outside of the house were crowded. By the evening, no one had yet collected the body. Yesterday, the neighbors advised the deceased's brother, A'lin, to prepare a coffin and collect the body first.</p>
<h3>Demolition Dispute in Yongkang Lane</h3>
<p>Tenants Discuss Self-Help Measures</p>
<p>Previously, the tenants of Yongkang Lane, North Sichuan Road, received a letter from the landlord's side (Yongkang Company) stating that the houses in the lane had been sold to Wanfu Company and were to be renovated. Therefore, the tenants were ordered to move out by August 15. The tenants found that the company (Yongkang Company) originally had seven shareholders. Now, the Chen and Lu shareholders invested in the acquisition and changed the name to Wanfu Company. They used the excuse of demolition and renovation to drive away the tenants and then made slight repairs so that they could arbitrarily increase the rent (from 16 yuan to 35 yuan). However, these houses were built on land leased from a landlord surnamed Yao in 1913 for a term of twenty years. Subtracting the current time, there are only three years left. When the lease expires, the land must be returned, so it is impossible to demolish the houses. Therefore, the tenants repeatedly negotiated with the landlord, willing to automatically increase the rent, but to no avail. They hired lawyer Chen Wenxiang to file a lawsuit in the Local Court. The court held two hearings that were not concluded and ordered them to reconcile outside the court. Yesterday afternoon, the Yongkang Lane Tenants' Association held a meeting to discuss the matter. Chairman Zheng Guogan reported everything, saying that Judge Zhao Zhenhai of the court had impartially investigated the case and ordered a reconciliation, but the landlord was not sincere about reconciliation and negotiations. Now, they hope that the tenants will remain calm and wait for a legal resolution. The tenants then said that the landlord had ordered the gatekeeper to prevent the cleaners from entering the lane to remove garbage and had cut off the water and electricity and erected bamboo fences, which should be stopped. (1) Committee member She Guinan proposed that the removal of garbage be reported to the Health Bureau. As for the cutting off of water and electricity and the erection of bamboo fences, which are related to public security, they should wait for the landlord to implement them during the litigation period. Besides, the rent has already been deposited in the bank, so the landlord has not suffered any losses. (2) Executive committee member Ouyang Hengran proposed that the landlord secretly requested the Public Works Bureau to issue permits to demolish the front and back doors of the vacant houses, which has led to thefts from neighboring tenants. If any reactionary sneaks into the vacant houses and takes inappropriate actions, the landlord must be held fully responsible. They also proposed to petition the Public Works Bureau to stop issuing permits. The resolution was passed. There were no objections, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Commander Xiong Protects the World Theatre</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Xiong Shihui, Commander of the Songhu Garrison Command, specially issued a proclamation stating that, according to a report submitted by Bian Yuying, manager of the World Theatre in Zhabei, the theatre had been established for over five years. Although it was a commercial venture funded by merchants, it had contributed in a small way to the prosperity of the Zhabei market. Furthermore, it had achieved early recognition for using the silver screen to promote revolutionary work. As the Chinese people lacked adequate entertainment, the theatre provided a place for relaxation during leisure time. However, due to the recent economic downturn, the theatre's business had declined significantly, causing it substantial losses. Manager Bian Yuying had spared no effort in managing the theatre, but it had been repeatedly harassed by local ruffians and hooligans, falsely claiming to be a small number of lawless military police, acting with extreme barbarity. The theatre had always had preferential treatment for armed comrades, offering half-price tickets. However, incidents of troublemaking often occurred, causing regular patrons to avoid the theatre, which significantly affected its business and had a major impact on local peace and tranquility. The theatre had requested the issuance of a proclamation and the dispatch of a patrol for protection, which temporarily suppressed the disturbances, allowing the theatre to operate in relative peace. Unexpectedly, recently discharged wounded soldiers had arrived, and the theatre staff, sympathetic to their war injuries, offered them extra preferential treatment. As a result, local ruffians seized the opportunity to gather in groups, always arriving in teams. Initially, there were three to five people, some even wearing military uniforms and insignia. Later, they formed groups of forty to fifty, and recently, each time there were nearly a hundred, mostly in plain clothes. They entered without purchasing tickets and then arbitrarily caused trouble. Sometimes, when the theatre asked them to show their passes, they refused, clearly acting as ruffians taking advantage of the military's reputation. Furthermore, they relied on their thuggish behavior to harass female patrons, acting violently and unreasonably. The theatre's premises were small and could not accommodate so many non-paying spectators, and the insult to women was a violation of public morals. For the sake of the theatre's business prospects, this situation had become unbearable, and for the sake of local peace and tranquility, it was even more concerning. Therefore, the theatre had repeatedly submitted requests for the dispatch of a number of troops to protect the theatre during performance times, and for the issuance of a proclamation to strictly prohibit ticketless viewing, so that the military and civilians could coexist peacefully and the theatre's business could continue. It has long been admired that Your Excellency has been stationed in Shanghai for several years, and the discipline of the military has been especially strict, bringing peace to the area, and the theatre has also benefited from it. It is hoped that Your Excellency will give appropriate consideration to the issues of ticketless viewing and the harassment of women, and there will be no limit to the anticipation. Based on this investigation, it is clear that ticketless viewing violates regulations, and arbitrary troublemaking disrupts the law. If this is not strictly prohibited, how can business be maintained and the military's reputation be preserved? Therefore, this proclamation is issued to all subordinate military and police personnel to be aware that, henceforth, when entering the theatre, they must abide by the regulations and must not arbitrarily cause trouble. Anyone who dares to violate this will be severely punished. This proclamation is issued on September 16th of the 19th year of the Republic of China by Xiong Shihui, also the commander. It is also reported that Deputy Adjutant Geng of the 27th Regiment of the 5th Division personally visited the theatre to observe for a week, and Commander Xie has dispatched a platoon of soldiers daily to maintain order in the theatre since the previous day.</p>
<h3>Dasin Silk and Satin Bureau Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Dasin Silk and Satin Bureau on Sanma Road was founded by Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, with the aim of promoting national goods. Over the years, its business has developed greatly, and the goods it sells are carefully selected for their quality and exquisite designs, making them even more popular with the public. Because the original address was not sufficient, a new four-story Western-style building was built at the intersection of Sanma Road and Shilu Road. It has now been completed and is scheduled to move to the new address on the 22nd of this month to expand its business. It has also specially created a new fashion department and hired skilled technicians to create new styles that cater to the new era. Its characteristics are: 1. It combines the elegance of Eastern culture with the smooth spirit of European and American culture. 2. It avoids monotony in tranquility and eliminates triviality in magnificence. As for its rich clothing materials, attentive service, conscientious pricing, and punctual delivery, these are even more trivial.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding a report in the "Local News" section of your newspaper yesterday stating that our association's fire engine injured four girls on North Sichuan Road. After investigation, it was found that the vehicle in question was a private car, number 10492, belonging to Mr. Li Yanchun, a volunteer member of our association, which was also on its way to a fire emergency. It is believed that he failed to avoid the girls, causing the accident, and it was not our association's fire engine. In order to avoid misunderstandings by the outside world, we have specially written this letter requesting a correction in the "Letters to the Editor" section to clarify the facts and express our public friendship.</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>

The business is booming and improving every day. Recently, the owners of the pharmacy, Sun Wenan and Wenyi, have seen that the national medicine industry is not yet popular in the Zhabei area, so they have established a branch of Tongchuntang North at the north end of the Laoza Bridge. After half a year of preparation, all kinds of medicines have been refined and perfected. The grand opening is set for September 24th, offering preferential treatment to customers. No matter whether they are buying decoctions, pills, powders, ginseng, or supplements, they will receive a flat 39% discount off the marked price, plus gifts.

<h3>"The Youth of the Times"</h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>Issue 6 Published by Daguang Bookstore</p>
<p>Today's publishing industry in China mostly presents a glaringly poor state of affairs, tending towards commercialization. There is a complete disregard for the introduction of genuinely valuable academic works from around the world and the promotion of Chinese literature. The sole concern is whether or not there will be improvement in their own business. Therefore, the books published focus exclusively on aspects of sex, catering to the psychology and low-level tastes of the general public. Previously, bookstores were filled with distorted and perverted works of art. Recently, many so-called political, social, and scientific books have been published, all of which are sufficient to intoxicate aspiring young people, leading them astray and shaping incorrect thinking. This is not only a crisis for Chinese publishing but also the greatest crisis for Chinese youth. The only way to break through this crisis in the shortest possible time is to start with improving the publications that the average young student of today often encounters. This is the most obvious fact.</p>
<p>Recently, scholars who advocate central thought and nationalistic literature have actively noticed this point. We must understand that the average young person who is currently studying is the pillar of the future China. So we can also say that the rise and fall of the Chinese nation depends on how hard these young people work. However, the will of young people mostly belongs to the weak. The phrase "one who stays near vermilion gets stained red, and one who stays near ink gets stained black" has become an extremely common phenomenon. If we want to make up for this deficiency in will and behavior, we must of course work hard on publications. Because the average young person in school, regardless of whether he has a strange preference for books or not, must at least find some publications to pass the time in his spare time. Sometimes he picks up a pen and writes a few lines of wind and moon, which also influences the so-called distorted and perverted works of art. Other things, such as social sciences, etc., poison young people in the same way. And the bookstores, which only seek the development of their own business, do not pay any attention to the books that help young people solve their own problems. Even if some aspiring young people want to read books about this kind of thing, they have no way to buy them, so they can only go down the distorted road to seek the satisfaction of their literary desires. This is really a pity. It was not until recently that a central publication pointing the way for modern youth came into being. The first thing that is active in front of our eyes is the "The Youth of the Times" weekly magazine, which I now want to piously recommend to the young readers. It has published six issues. The content is very rich and gives us a lot of correct instructions. It has become a good reading material for the average young person in modern China.</p>
<p>The content of this issue is even more exciting. The topics include "The Silence of the Sino-Russian Conference," "The Fall of Young Leaders," "The Future of School Drama Movement," and "The Secret Oath of Jin Guangmei, a Newly Emerging Shanghai Celebrity." Each article is a carefully crafted piece that we must read. They are briefly described separately below.</p>
<p>"The Silence of the Sino-Russian Conference" The author divides the full text into four paragraphs. In the first paragraph, the introduction, the so-called Sino-Russian official conference, which is related to my country's international status, is described in a very concise manner. At the same time, it is mentioned that the Russian side is abusing foreign nations and our Chinese compatriots, so that the average faint young people can understand the fear of the red color. The second paragraph is about the cause of the conference, detailing the incident as if reading a long-term newspaper. Because for a very important event, you must first understand the cause and then examine the success or failure of the result. The author, Mr. Lao, is of course good at writing, so he is very敏捷注意到this. The third paragraph is about the recent situation of the Sino-Russian conference, exposing the aggressive ambitions of Soviet Russia, and discussing it in detail based on correct facts, so that we can understand what kind of situation the Sino-Russian conference is heading towards recently. The fourth paragraph, the concluding remarks, of course summarizes what has been discussed above, but the author, in order to urge the average young people to rise up and strive for this major event, has such a warning at the end: "But young people, we should arouse the enthusiasm in our bodies and strive to glorify the nation, support Mr. Mo, and swear to fight the Soviet Union to the end in order to obtain the glory of our nation's permanent independence."</p>
<p>Drama, a synthesis of the arts, also urgently needs to be promoted in China, where the ideological world is chaotic. At the same time, some incorrect content and theories related to this item in the past need to be explored or corrected, because drama includes hearing and vision in essence, so its effectiveness in the field of art is broader and easier to absorb than other audiences, especially the current students who have a strong love for drama, but they are distorted to seek the satisfaction of desires. The performances in school concerts are nothing more than the song and dance dramas that are still popular in ordinary society today. The performance of this kind of drama is really harmful to Chinese youth, and the "Chinese Students," which is called youth reading, has also published a special issue on school drama movement, but the dramas discussed and introduced in it do not meet the requirements of the average youth, and at the same time instill young people with incorrect ideas. This is really not a sincere attitude to promote drama. From this point of view, the promotion and advocacy of school drama is something that cannot be delayed at present. Mr. Da Zhuang's article "The Future of School Drama Movement" is really worthy of our attention. He discusses the morbid state of old dramas, the mistakes of past drama theories, and the lack of love dramas. In it, he gives detailed development and instructions on the significance and direction of school dramas, such as:</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Drama stands in a very important position in literature and art. Currently, based on the requirements of the times, nationalistic literary theory has been established in literature and art in order to achieve national survival and evolution. This is what should be done. At a time of suffering, when the nation is invaded and oppressed by foreign races, and its own national consciousness is so depressed, it is bound to rely on the power of literature and art to promote the completion of the political nationalist movement. Now our school drama is aimed solely at young people. In the future, the mission of young people is to bear the responsibility of the nation and the country, to try to restore the inherent youth of this aging and withered nation, and at the same time to nurture and enrich the elements of vitality, and to hope for the prosperity of development. Then, the mission that school drama should bear must only be to promote their strong and consistent national concepts and consciousness, and to fight for national survival.</p>
<p>This is such a painful and precise statement, giving young people a lot of correct instructions. At the same time, scholars who promote school drama with misleading ideas should quickly wake up and not use any poison to anesthetize aspiring young people. At least after reading Mr. Da Zhuang's article.</p>
<p>Guangmei's "Secret Oath" is a short story with profound implications. It describes the various impressions that Mr. and Mrs. Zhang had after watching a film starring Chaplin that humiliated the Chinese nation, and describes it as if the screen were really performing. The various places where our Chinese nation was insulted were very tense and powerful, so that readers could not help but want to jump up. Literary works like this are very much needed at the moment. Mr. Guangmei was able to notice this before us, which is worthy of admiration. The final summary is so compact and powerful, clearly showing the author's talent for writing and creation.</p>
<p>That night, both of them were restless and could not sleep. They sang enthusiastically and generously. They were completely awake. So they stood shoulder to shoulder by the window. He raised his right hand, she raised her left hand, and they swore to the sky: "I, Zhang Zhiwen, and I, Xu Peizhen, from now on, are willing to sacrifice, struggle, and dedicate ourselves to our Chinese nation!" Finally, they shouted in unison.</p>
<p>This is indeed a rare creation with central ideas. It is really worth applauding and rejoicing to be able to meet us on the small "Youth of the Times" weekly magazine. I hope that the "Youth of the Times," which young people must read, will often have such beautiful and powerful creations published after huge treatises, so that we can taste the sour green fruit and taste the delicious chewing gum. How refreshing! I want to say one last word carefully.</p>
<p>"Youth of the Times" is a must-read publication for Chinese youth.</p>

<h3>The "Tai Meng" Western Painting Research Society</h3>
<p>In recent years, the art movement in our country has been very prosperous, but in terms of quality, although it is developing day by day, in terms of quantity, there is very little strength. The reason is that there are no purely art research institutions other than schools. The Tai Meng Painting Society, in view of this, has specially invited famous artists from home and abroad to establish a research institute, so that art lovers can have more opportunities for research and cultivate advanced art. The association has now published advertisements soliciting researchers. The content equipment is similar to the Académie in Paris, France. Everything is quite perfect. Western painters such as Hu Daozhi, Pang Xunqin, Wang Dilang, Zhou Tai, Guo Gu, Niliu Yanren, etc. are in charge of guidance. Practical training has already begun.</p>
<h3>On Qinglong Bridge</h3>
<p>— Wen Juan</p>
<p>The golden wind shatters the sky, bringing autumn. Teachers and students from schools, seeking to gather materials, also take this opportunity to travel to mountain peaks and riverbanks to collect specimens. Our group discussed going to Qinglong Bridge, because it is the highest point on the Jing-Sui Railway, on the northern side of the Great Wall. There should be plenty of flowers, plants, and insects to find there. On a clear, blue Sunday morning, we set off. On the train from Xuanhua to Qinglong Bridge, a large flag of the provincial No. XX middle school fluttered in the wind, seeming to act as a pioneer for us. After passing through several tunnels, and gazing at the Great Wall, like a chain locking the great and solemn Badaling mountain range, it appeared distinctly before our eyes. The students, lively and jostling, got off the train, each carrying their specimen boxes and food boxes. Some had their hands free, with only a camera slung over their shoulders, or a diary tucked under their arms, as they leisurely left the station and followed the road towards the Great Wall.</p>
<p>Midway, we encountered many foreign ladies sitting anxiously in bamboo chairs, carried up and down by two sedan chair bearers. I saw that they showed surprised expressions towards our group of lively and jumping female students who were not afraid of the long and winding stone paths, perhaps thinking we were admirable women of the new China, or perhaps thinking we were lowly girls who didn't deserve to ride in sedan chairs. Whether they cursed us or praised us, it was none of our business. We, these twenty or thirty people unafraid of hardship and danger, had already climbed to the top and were standing on the ramparts, singing travel songs.</p>
<p>Xin advocated taking deep breaths. Everyone echoed her. For a moment, the sound of laughter and chatter ceased, with only the light sound of arms swinging spreading in the west wind.</p>
<p>"I found a golden bellflower!"</p>
<p>"I saw a wild man's blood plant!"</p>
<p>"Hey, there's a jade beetle here!"</p>
<p>"Don't be noisy, you'll scare away my tricolored butterfly!"</p>
<p>These whispers filled the still valleys of the Great Wall, like music heard in a dream, fleeting and mysterious. I, however, did not move, but stared entranced at the overlapping mountain peaks and the rivers, small as ribbons. The water flowed, weaving around the foothills, the railway weaving around the riverbanks, extending endlessly into the distance. A touch of green mountain was entangled by the white Great Wall, seeming to end only at the edge of the sky. White clouds brushed across the sky like upside-down phoenix tails. The autumn scenery was already beautiful enough, and even more so in such surroundings.</p>
<p>"Are you daydreaming?" Qing forcefully pulled at the corner of my skirt. It turned out that she was sitting on the ground digging up the root of a grass. This was a kind of Asteraceae plant, commonly called "fire lala," which is not easy to find in the north, so Qing was working so hard. I saw that she didn't use a shovel but used her ten fingers as tools and had almost dug out the main root, her hands covered in mud, not caring about the dirt.</p>
<p>"Why don't you use a small knife?"</p>
<p>"Hmph, what do you know? If I use a knife, the fine roots will be cut off."</p>
<p>Soon, the students scattered in various places all returned.</p>
<p>Just now, it was empty valleys; now, it's a triumphant return. With a roar, everyone laughed. Then, they sat down on the ground, took out the food boxes they had brought, placed them on a rock, and prepared to eat and drink. Everyone was busy grabbing and tearing at chicken legs.</p>
<p>"This group of famine refugees must not have eaten for three years, right?"</p>
<p>Someone said this and grabbed four steamed buns and walked away to eat them. In a flash, a whirlwind swept through, and fifteen or sixteen food boxes and several baskets of steamed buns were already empty. I felt that since I learned to eat, I had never had such a delicious meal as that day. The good mountain air must be a reason for increasing appetite.</p>
<p>The faint sun shone on the tired faces of the people after their full meal. Everyone seemed a little sleepy. Mr. Zhang, wearing yellow riding clothes and holding a small wooden box, also hurried over from a distant mountain. Her face was covered in sweat, and she was panting like a goat that had just been chased by a tiger, shouting in her mouth:</p>
<p>"Terrible, terrible! You all go and take a look!"</p>
<p>We were awakened by her shouting, and we all cheered up and listened to her report. She put down the box, wiped the sweat from her face, and slowly said:</p>
<p>"There's a big wolf lying in a cave over there!"</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to act like heroes, vying to say, "I'll go first!" Even Ping, who had never dared to step on a cockroach, said she wasn't afraid. The result was ten people formed a team, for a total of two and a half teams. Mr. Zhang was the captain, and the team headed mightily towards the back of the mountain. Each person perked up their spirits, carried the camera tripod as a charging weapon, and used the pillow box as an attack tool, aiming it at the place indicated by Mr. Zhang, looking towards it.</p>
<p>Only a long howl was heard, and in an instant, the mountains and valleys echoed, and the yellow leaves in the forest rustled, falling with the wind, making strange sounds. Ping tightly grasped my clothes, her body crouched down more than halfway. Some retreated, and some hid secretly, taking advantage of the ambush.</p>
<p>"In the trap! In the net!"</p>
<p>Someone discovered it first and shouted. Then, everyone's courage was restored all at once. Those hidden elsewhere also came out, peeking to see if this yellow wolf that had already been caught could still come out and eat people. Fortunately, a hunter had already jumped out from behind a tree, locked the lid of the wire cage, and carried it on his back as if to go home. Mr. Zhang asked him for two wolf teeth. The hunter agreed to send them over in a while and happily went down the mountain with his trophy.</p>
<p>We also sighed in relief, as if we had also contributed to this victory.</p>
<h3>Mother and Child</h3>
<p>— Photographed by Su Duyu</p>
<p>We started searching for objects again, hoping that we could be so lucky and get something safely. All kinds of wild grasses filled everyone's boxes. The flying and crawling insects lay lazily in glass-covered boxes.</p>
<p>Today's harvest was quite good, except that Mr. Zhang's wolf teeth seemed to be obtained too easily.</p>
<p>I think that when we re-embarked on our return journey, the sun had already hidden its face, leaving only its departing autumn waves, faintly shining on the verdant mountain tops for a moment towards the human world. We stepped on this ancient road in the setting sun, looking back at the towering Great Wall, standing alone like the shadow of a giant, disappearing into the vast twilight.</p>
<h3>Youth Forum Guidelines</h3>
<p>(1) Articles should focus on discussions of youth issues, domestic and foreign school or student news, essays, and depictions of school life. The style is not restricted.</p>
