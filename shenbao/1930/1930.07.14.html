<p>時評</p>
<h3>各國政府與國會之爭</h3>
<p>今日議會政治之國政府與議會間幾無一國不起風潮或則爲海約或則爲國防費。或則爲救濟財政議會每表示異見而爲政府者又不能强迫議會以必從。如今日之德政府雖擁有憲法四十八條之特權而終不敢輕於一試者因用此特權以解决其事勢必愈增議會之反感結果非仍解散國會不可也然解散而重選。非特事體繁重且亦難保其必衋如政府意故今日德政府仍在猶豫之間。法政府以難題無法解决僅下令提早休會而已激起反對派之結合致目此舉爲高壓暴横决。欲進行倒閣是休會亦無益於法政局也蓋今日兩方之爭。雖未必一無私見。然大致皆欲謀有利於國家旣非有深仇夙怨之不可解。亦不敢自信其政策之必有利而無害故雖爭而皆不願以最後之手段出之也。</p>
<p>然在此議會糾紛之潮流中。亦有一例外焉即今日所傅埃王下令解散國會是也。蓋此次埃及會議與政府之爭純爲奪取政權。一方欲擁護前閣一方欲擁護現閣。擁護前閣者作反對現政府運動擁護現閣者作壓迫議會之運動遂致釀成民衆與軍警衝突之大慘劇世界惟此爭奪權利之人祇知報仇洩恨而不顧大局。無論何種手段皆可逞心嘗試故吾謂埃及之國會爭潮不能與其他各國之爭潮同列而並論之也。</p>

<h3>何鍵報告作戰經過（續）</h3>
<p>衡州鏖戰之兩軍戰略</p>
<p>張桂軍失敗之三原因</p>
<p>第二爲逆軍不擇手段利用共匪從前一般民衆、每每總說李白黄等逆是絕對剷共的人本人在以前也很相信他們能夠澈底剷共但是就目前他們的一切行動看起來、那就大謬不然有些地方竟與共匪無異、共黨侵略東方赤化中國的計劃是挑撥中國内亂乘機暴動尤其對於蔣總司令是要以全力儘量攻擊他們（共産黨）以爲現在能夠維持中國現狀的、厥惟蔣總司令、蔣倒之後没有第二個人可以維持中國的局面化們（共産黨）侵略東方赤化中國的計劃才能成功、我們曾看見共黨搗亂的計劃他們（共産黨）極欲利用目前國内混亂奪取武漢動搖中央、藉推翻蔣總司令我們湖南因爲剷共最力、他們（共産黨）遂認爲湖南反動勢力、特大非先將湖南擾亂、破壤湘鄂交通、則武漢不易取得所以共匪乘桂軍在湘蹂躪時以全力在湘境各地暴動遙與桂軍相應同時李白黄等逆、也利用共匪在湘境各地暴動乘機入湘、希圖奪取武漢動搖中央藉以推翻蔣總司令遙與共匪相應李白黄等逆與共匪因爲擾亂湖南圖取武漢動搖中央、推翻蔣總司令的目的都是相同所以他們的行動、也與共匪一樣的不擇手段明知湘省受共匪的禍已深不堪再擾畢竟不顧一切的入湘蹂躪并且白崇禧宣言在倒蔣旗幟之下、無論什麽人都可合作、共産黨也包括在内白逆等與共匪合作、有事實可以證明、他曾派人收編彭德懹部、我軍在前線作戰時曾拾得彭部士兵符號似此不擇手段、利用殺人放火的共匪、斷無不失敗之理這是逆軍根本失敗的原因二、第三爲逆軍已成民衆的公敵、這次逆軍竊據長沙將湖南煞費經營的各項政治統系破壤無餘公私損失不可數計、並且嗾使共匪在平瀏南華津灃一帶、恣意搗亂、損失不下千數百萬湖南三千萬民衆受了逆軍這次很大的痛苦、除去附逆與投機份子外無一人不切齒痛恨逆軍旣已成了湖南民衆的公敵斷無不失敗之理這是逆軍根本失敗的原因三逆軍基此三項根本失敗的原因、本應該完全殲滅這次在湘境雖仍剩了三分之一、未被全部消滅但是竄回廣西老巢的殘餘相信一定不再存在因爲竄去殘部、不過萬人、指揮已不統一四八兩路軍已經跟踪尾追廣州陳總指揮已赴梧州堵截、雲南龍總指揮又由後方抄擊預料不久一定可將逆軍全部殲滅、至於湖南境内討逆任務現在已完全告一段落湖南討逆任務告一段落之後應積極從事整理善後的事件甚多今後自當按步就班的逐一實行、目前最急要應做的工作、本人認爲計有下列三點（一）肅淸逆部殘餘、逆軍這次潰敗逃散甚多、曾令各縣團局一體遵照收繳殘部的散槍連日據報、已經收繳不少、在最近個兩月以内政府一定注意積極辦理此事、務　逆部殘餘　底肅淸以免遺害地方（二）肅淸殘部與反動份子凡屬叛變附逆的反甘心與逆軍結合的叛部當然要澈底肅淸、此外還有些勾引逆軍擾亂桑梓的反動份子、以及意志薄弱的投機份子亦應分别懲辦、因爲如無反無反動份子從中勾引逆軍决不敢入湘、即令犯湘作惡亦不致有如此之大、如無投機份子附逆、逆軍即作惡不起、即令作惡亦不致有如此之烈這兩種人不明順逆破壤桑梓、對於本黨又無認識自不能不分别處治以伸正氣（三）肅淸兵共匪萬惡的共匪、是與逆軍遙遙相應乘機搗亂本人在衡州曾見逆軍在永州發行的報紙上載平劉已入共匪之手將攻長沙云云</p>
<p>一種幸災樂禍的口吻深願共匪進犯長沙、可見逆軍與共匪實在是互相利用現在湖南境内討逆旣告一段落從前因有討逆的關係分去大部份兵力不能以全力剷共、現在逆軍已在湘境消滅一三分二以上、竄桂殘餘亦殲滅有期今後當能多調部隊積極剷共現正擬具整個剷共計劃、中央亦令四路軍於討逆之後繼續剷共、本人對於今後剷共已有絕對的把握、只要我們能夠依照計劃繼續不斷的努力幹去相信一定很容易的殲滅不過剷共是單純的軍事力量所能作到、要全體民眾一致起來通力合作、方能成功、共黨是絕對不妥協的、并且不認親友、共黨并無中央、他的祖國就是蘇維埃、我們曾抄獲共黨四省决議案內有欺騙民眾的陰謀甚夥、不日印發俾大家明瞭共匪的險毒、內有一項說只有貧農雇農是無產階級、并將別注意不准貧農雇農變為富農、這種欺騙農人的方法極為厲害、以為如此則貧農雇農永遠不能成為富農即永遠受共黨的驅策永遠受其麻醉、最近共匪與官軍作戰都是驅使民眾走前、所以平瀏一帶近來擊斃共匪雖多其中被共匪逼作前驅之民眾也打死不少、我們今後的剷共很希望受共匪欺騙之農工民眾要一致的覺悟起來與其被共匪逼作前驅而死、不如協助官軍極力剷共、俾得安居樂業所以我們今後剷共除軍事力量之外、要以喚起各地農工民眾一致協同官軍努力剷共為最重要的工作、以上三、項乃湖南目前最急要的工作、誓必儘我們的力量努力作去以鞏固湖南的治安鞏固湖南的治安就是鞏固兩湖的治安鞏固兩湖的治安就是鞏固中央、我們如欲竭誠擁護中央就以努力鞏固湖南的治安着手這是本人與黨政軍負責的各同志應特別努力的地方本人在衡原來尚有數日勾留因為何主任在湘指導討逆已告一段落武漢方面尚有許多要事須待何主任回漢計劃不日即須返漢、本人因關於湘省一切重要問題、也有許多事項向何主任商量并請示、所以於昨日趕回長沙對於竄桂殘軍、已派定部隊跟追、本月四日已抵黃沙河、昨日可追至全州、軍事既告一段落無再赴衡之必要此後在省當竭全力先從事於以上三項工作、這次逆軍蹂躪湖</p>

<h3>滬大童軍赴日誌盛張敏光</h3>
<p>楊樹浦滬江大學童子軍。訓練有素成績優良此次承日本各團體之敦請及贊助特乘暑假餘。暇赴日作匝月之觀光并遍遊神户大阪奈良横濱京都東京日光等名勝。月之九日爲該團東渡之期。余以懹弟叔良及摰友黄君志華吳君爾昌都身列戎行故特隨雙親曁長兄育黎前往歡送爰將當時盛况拉雜書之。</p>
<p>是日和風習晨光融融。大有暗示歡送之氣槪七時四十五分。吾輩車抵匯山碼頭。嗣以長崎丸停泊於黄浦碼頭乃旋車而就之。至則歡送者。早已手持水菓爆竹曁五色彩條之類。齊集江千以俟乃兄乃弟若子若兒之將至也。俄而樂聲洋洋國旗飄展。衆目盼望之滬大童軍。頓於人叢中列陣而出軍容嚴肅。隊伍整齊服裝雖屬平凡。然肩章係綴以（中華）二字頗具代表全中國童子軍之色彩。故極爲歡送者所注目童軍進行至船旁。即列陣（立正）。斯時家屬多向隊伍探訪其子弟。而童軍遇相識者。每報之以微笑。似有無限之歡忭焉。</p>
<p>此行聞人之來送者。有吳淞砲台魚雷艦隊司令曾以鼎氏曁其家屬數人。并贈童軍黄旗一面書曰（相期無窮。）而胡適之博士。亦蒞塲歡送。蓋均爲其愛子亦在軍中也。胡氏少君年最幼列隊之殿。英俊活潑可愛。胡氏則目架羅克眼鏡身穿夏布長衫草帽布履。出没於人叢之中。并操英語謂其友人曰（吾子年最幼列最</p>
<p>後……語時面露笑容其得意可知鐘鳴九下。長崎丸按時啓碇歡送之帶有五色彩條者即與别者互執一端以示依依不捨之意而無此物者多奔走購買。雖重價不咅宜乎作此投機生意之小販。無不利巿三倍且大有供不應求之槪五然彩條旣飛舞於空中。而爆竹之聲亦繼起於岸上加以童軍雄壯之歡呼及奮發之軍歌。益足以壯行色并慰送者之心童軍此次赴日觀光特帶有絲竹之類。以資表演。殊屬别開生面之舉聞歸國時。擬乘世界最大最速之日本郵船秩父丸云。</p>
<h3>西裝瑣談鄭逸梅</h3>
<p>西裝已普徧通行於世界。吾國人士之穿西裝者。亦幾佔十之二三。其便捷附貼。確勝於寛袍大袖多多。且海上宵行。時有剥猪玀之患。惟穿西裝者。得幸而免蓋西裝不易質錢非剥先生所喜光顧也。</p>
<p>近來西裝褲管仿美國式較前放大據自新大陸歸來之某君云前年英王太子游歷赴美美。邦人士開會歡迎不料船將近埠王太子之褲。忽而損裂然臨行怱遽。未多携一襲可更換者。正躊躇間。一水手以己之新褲奉獻王太子不遑選擇即贸然穿御。開會之時。美邦人士見之。欣羡之至謂褲樣大方。甚爲雅致於是相率摹倣大脚管之褲。頓時盛行於社會。</p>
<p>香港當局對於西裝之褲懸有罰例襠鈕不扣每枚罰以五金謂爲有關風化聞海上法租界亦有仿行之說但示知確否。</p>
<p>西裝材料。大都爲舶來品於此金貴聲中。價値奇昂。尤非相宜最好以國貨爲之。以塞漏巵。吾友徐荷生名敎育家也日前晤叙。見徐君御夏季西裝以哆羅蔴製成。爽適樸雅得未曾有哆羅蔴爲贛省所産質料堅緻色微黄固爲佳品據徐君云。曩唐少川氏曾以哆羅蔴製西裝御之赴某處會議。蔣中正主席亦曾以哆羅蔴製中山裝御之督戰陣前予特步武偉人。非敢掠創先之功也。</p>
<h3>客中閒話劉豁安</h3>
<p>蘇州謝病。無錫依然。故區區之惜别情懹。幾幾與烟波三萬六千頃相爭竸也。</p>
<p>别無錫新聞同志有一詩云綠波紅杏好風光。翻惹離人别恨長珍重一聲飛馬去。從今魂戀碧山旁情在其中矣</p>
<p>鎭江訪伯先公園念昔爲本報寗訪與伯先有舊倉卒题一聯云。花草精神恰好與民同樂風雲感慨。那堪對景懹人亦聯寫我懹而已。</p>
<h3>各國發明之多寡濤</h3>
<p>瑞京某報。發表。一饒有趣味之指數表。謂據美國統計專家依各國人口之比例計算。其人民發明之多寡。以指數方法計之。所得結果。瑞士第一。其指數爲九三○。瑞典次之二九九。德國再次之。二七一其餘依次類推則爲丹麥之二三六。挪威二二九法國一九五。英國一八八比利時一八○澳大利亞及美國各一四○。捷克司拉夫一○八。匈牙利六八。意大利四二。芬蘭四○印度俄羅斯最低僅二分之一。及十分之九而已。表末更附帶聲明謂蘇俄雖於物質發明不幸居後然近年來其政治社會方面之新發明。不一而足惜皆未能予世人以實惠耳</p>
<h3>東遊心影（六）</h3>
<p>（六）神户之一瞥</p>
<p>由長崎至神户乘火車十六小時可逹乘輪則須二十小時但乘車中途至門司須擺渡過江行旅稍感困苦。而舟行日本内海小島林立靑山綠水旣擅風景之勝又無風浪之苦故由滬赴日者以直逹神户爲佳上海丸於十四日下午五時離長崎是晚舟中有跳舞會淸歌妙舞同舟乘客歡若家人。至十一時始就寢翌黎明即起八時舟過來島海峽左爲中户島右爲馬島。亦日本之名勝也。乘客羣集甲板持望遠鏡遠眺往來輪隻頗多本屬日郵船社所有時時鳴笛下旗致敬十一時抵神户先期佈告乘客凡外國人入境者應先騐護照後方得登陸華人雖無庸護照但尙須經警察最後一度之查問凡一句鐘。始完全竣事本報駐神户記者曾衍華君來接。偕同下輪後至稅關。受行李檢查日本關例私。運烟酒。處罰最嚴舟中事前備有行李報告單一紙。囑乘客自行塡就報關。頭等艙客携帶香烟以一百枝爲限過此即没收科罰騐關處距碼頭約百餘武關吏檢查極爲嚴密翻箱倒篋即一紙微亦經詳細之審視於華人尤甚騐訖後蓋戳放行至轉角處尙須經一度之覆騐故携帶違禁物品及偷稅甚感困難也神户巿爲日本重要口岸之一各地航線凡經過日本者均在神户停泊。故商務繁盛銀行林立街巿極淸潔馬路寛大。彷彿我國之天津。交通除電車人力車外以汽車爲利器沿途可僱凡乘坐一次不論路途遠近。爲日金一元人力車亦極普遍。通常乘價約日金半元左右速率旣緩時間亦太不經濟將來定在淘汰之列。神户華僑以經營銀行業者爲多。握有一部分經濟勢力此次遠東運動會我國選手赴日經費神户華僑亦捐助五千餘金。熱心祖國可見一斑僑胞以粤人最佔勢力對於體育事業尤爲熱心。有神户華僑籃球隊之組織在當地頗負時譽曾出席全國運動會博得不少好評。隊員多爲神户商科大學出身。對於籃球戰術有極佳之基礎曾與日本最强之早大籃球隊作戰。雖幸敗北。但比數尙爲接近。苟能善自切磋作不斷的練習將來定能成一勁旅記者怱促遊覽全巿一週。即於下午四時偕曾君乘車至大阪。</p>
<p>余天送神交。曾代擬閔行花米公所聯云天下願存衣被志。人生底爲稻梁謀一夢多年驚心噩耗。因挽以聯云海上同文。難得捉力讓美。天涯驚變。那堪痛哭斯人。。天遂有靈。當回首於人間之知己焉</p>
<p>十二圩古名鑾江重來感賦一詩云。卅載鑾江幾去來。奔波慚愧我無才。依人作嫁抛心力。與世難諧惹禍胎。也有精誠酬黨國。空餘風骨傲梅。樂觀還向前途重。安慰惟憑酒一杯。落魄江湖。更安問其死所耶。（却酬）</p>
<h3>冰繭瑣話陳蕙玲女士</h3>
<p>冰蠶繭荔枝别名。爲閩粤名産宜摘下即食皮鮮紅。肉瑩潔如水晶略具脆性。漿液甘甜。香留齒頰滬埠巿上所售。經數日之轉。運皮赭肉變香味大遜。已失却十八娘眞範矣。</p>
<p>余東莞母家。有南園。周百數畝内植荔枝百餘株夏間實熟。翕然俱赤千萬丹丸。團團台蓋少時常邀諸同學共登樹巔隨摘隨啖。天漿嚼破齒頰生凉。至今引爲韻事年來以衣食所驅隨拙庵旅居申浦。每聞樹上蟬鳴。（粤俗語。秋蟬哭。荔枝熟）遙望家園。輒爲悠然神往。</p>
<p>荔枝開花及果實未熟時期最忌爲人採折否則羣鳥咸集競啄花蕊幼果盡而後止余家荔枝園每於是時園丁巡邏嚴密非主人不得越雷池一步也</p>
<p>荔荷鴨爲我粤炎天佳饌余家製法宰鴨洗淨。調以油鹽。加水用鮮荔枝去皮核。置鴨下上覆鮮荷葉隔水。淸燉約二句鐘取出食之。淸香四溢。鮮美異常巿上廣式酒家。多備此饌製法雖略有不同。然亦大同小異。此中風味。食家每能道之。</p>

<p>土耳其的文學似乎在世界上没有佔着什麽地位、所以過的許多年代中中國的讀者但知有亞拉伯和波斯的故事並不曾有人談到土耳其、這種原因並非是土耳其没有値得介紹的偉大作家、實在是他們的國際地位和文字把他們湮没而限制了、因爲他們的文字和語言全是否舊艱深的亞拉伯字、而且國内的帝國主義者所辦的敎會學校、除了宗敎科目之外、除讀英文或法文外、禁此他們讀亞拉伯文使他們自然而然的把民族意識衰退、養成帝國主義的順民而他們的創作力便永遠的被壓抑而剥削了、但是自經革命後經過了幾年的建設、在把敎育權收回後、簡直把艱深而不國際化的亞拉伯字廢絕了、改用拉丁字母後、不識字的人已由五百萬而减了十分之、一</p>
<p>在革命後的國民黨政府極力推行歐文新字母的計劃中對於文學是非常之注意、而且極力的扶助書賈和學者們對於新聞紙和書報的推銷、想從人民的識字中重新建設新時代的文學、因爲在過去許多年代中、上耳其的文學産品太少、譯成外國文的只有小說家洛諾（ReshadNouri）（鷦鷯）（TheWren）一種是譯成了德文、那書是描述一個女子得了未婚夫的允諾、去到安那托利亞敎書以後得回到原地來同男子結婚、對於于描寫安那托利亞鄕野的景色和環境、完全帶着土耳其的地方色彩、雖然事實很簡單但因爲是不含有波斯或亞拉伯人的氣氛、而所含蓄的全是土耳其民族的色彩、所以在四年間買了二萬五千份他除了這著作外、、還有小說（從唇到心）（Ｆromliptoheart）（秘密的手）（Thesecrethand）（汚點）等</p>
<p>（關於文學上的波斯化和亞拉伯化的排除、是土耳其文學界想努力建設的一種事業、雖然亞拉伯人以為土耳其不能建設獨立的文化和文學、但是以民族意識為革命中心的凱末爾統治之下、是努力不絕的在向新土地開拓、他們很想擺脫中亞細亞諸國家內的東方色彩、所謂文、學只是沙漠野地裹產生的神話遺聞、軼事等的範疇而來重新踏上以描寫土耳其革命的經過和將來的企圖為主的文學底道路、所以、現刻是土耳其新文學建設的曙光期、在這種努力中對於法蘭西消閒派的作品底譯本、在新學生的眼目中、似乎是引他們走向民族頽廢的地步、我們也並不悲傷、因爲過去我們羅馬敎的宗敎敎育、和禁止土耳其文的學習底反感是應該在他們的民族意識啓發後發生的）、</p>
<p>這是法國天主敎會今年發表的年報中對於土耳其文學運動的批判、宗敎的宣傅自然是絕望了、（以上由美國世界路德敎總會底日報中譯出、）</p>
<p>法國早日是對於土耳其是實施文化侵略的、但是曾經帮助她革命的蘇俄底文學的主潮也不曾流入、而且在土耳其國内、簡直没有蘇聯制度和政治或文學的傾向、所以據（紐約導報）上轉述的蘇聯對於土耳其底考察的關於文學的一段中、所謂（土耳其從帝國主義的桎梏下擺脫而獨立不應把民族意識注入文學作品中、……她不應忘記俄國在革命期中給她的助力、在文學中自然也應抛棄中亞細亞游牧民族時代的民族意識、而在新字母的使用中、在新皮囊中盛上新的酒漿、底一切中、可以反映出土耳其文學將來的新途徑、是不屬於蘇俄和法蘭西或任何一個歐洲國家的、而她正在努力的建設以土耳其民族的基調的文學</p>
<p>所以土耳其在新舊字交替的期中、爲堅决的禁絕起見、曾經在君士坦丁堡禁燬了兩百萬册亞拉伯文書籍、更是在過去兩年間印行的千種書中、敎科書却佔了百分之八十在兒童用書中、文字是詩句的圖書是彩色的而在百分之二十中、有四十種小說、三十種收集的兒童故事、十五卷詩在最近已出版的有一册由議會議員專爲獎勵學生、而用的散文詩（點滴）(Dropbydrop)和快要出版的（東方安那託利亞之歌與舞（）SongsanddancesofEasternAntolja)和歐洲游記集成的（正則的讀物、）（土耳其民謠、）（凱末耳將軍傅記、）但是、全國的讀書者仍然集中在城巿而且除了學生外以讀者爲消遣的舊時代的人物、對於新字的書籍仍然不樂於閱讀、不過、政府推行新字的力量已完全到逹了民間、婦女和兒童對於新語引爲時髦而有趣、語言上已有了很大的變化、在包含新字三萬的字典出版後、預料新字的施行必然刷新土耳其東方病夫的頽習、爲她的將來引出一條光明的坦道、（易康）</p>
<h3>最近的法蘭西文壇明</h3>
<p>在法國政治家往往是文學家、文學家又往往做政治家、老虎總理克萊満莎就是如此這是遠一點的例子、近一點的呢、可以舉出那位新派的駐美法國大使克勞台爾（PaulChaudel）、</p>
<h3>克勞台爾</h3>
<p>不但是一位很有才幹的政治家、而且是法國現存的三四個最偉大作家之一、在歐洲文壇上、克勞台爾是一個很重要的戲曲家最近他出版了一部新著（緞拖鞋）（SoulierdeSatin）也是劇本據說這部劇本很偉大、可以算是近代傑作之一如果要和前人底作品比擬的話、那只有经諸哥德底（浮世德）、但丁底（神曲）這部劇本底故事很有點複雜、要三言兩語就說明是不可能的、故事底發生地是在西班牙、時代是十六世紀末葉和十七世紀初年、唐娜柏勞海士是一位美婦人可惜嫁了一個老頭子她丈夫是做官的、已經奉了西班牙國王之命要到菲洲去管轄西班牙底屬地地是將要跟她丈夫到菲洲去了、可是她捨不得丢下她的情人、因爲她愛上了唐洛特列格而唐洛特列格呢亦狂熱地愛她簡直是没有了她就不能做人、因此唐娜柏勞海士覺得她自己的處境危險、覺得如果没有人來帮助一下、她是一定要投入她情人底懹裏了、所以她就把她的一雙緞子拖鞋放在一尊維納司像底手上、以便觸目驚心有所警愓以後故事底背景由西班牙換到美國、日本、菲洲、（在地底肚子上的一塊火熱地方）我們看見這一對男女始終没有分離、始終是相愛着然而始終壓抑着她們的愛不讓它發洩、直到一步一步走近死了、還是如此洛特列格底結局又是奴隸又是英雄是寫得非常壯美的、、使人想起凡拉土該（Ｖelasquez）所畫的乞丐來</p>
<p>巴黎的BernaldGrasset書店新近出版了一本很古　怪的小說、名字叫</p>
<h3>大衛哥爾特</h3>
<p>（ＤavidGolder）、是英文作者是一位向來没有人知道的少婦、馬丹南迷洛芙斯基（lreneVemirovsky）她把稿子寄到書店裏時、曾聲明過假使可用、就寫一封信通知她、（留局待取）、因爲她並不寫出她的地址、但是書局裏看稿子的人慢得很、等到他送進報告說這部稿子可以採用的時候這位女作家已經等得不耐煩、後來索性不到郵局去領取她的信件了、因此書局裏、費盡了許多手續、後來才找到她這是一部驚人的作品、因爲其中有一種女作家底小說裏少有的力量從某一種觀點看起來、這部小說很像巴爾札克底名著（高列奥爹爹）（PereGoriot)可是更爲悲慘因爲那年老的銀行家猶太人大衛哥爾特最後是爲了他的女兒而死的、然而那女孩子其實並不是他的女兒、他妻子底情人才是她的父親、這本小說雖則是太陰暗太浪漫了點、但確有許多優點、它的對話是很生動很現實的、它自始至終能緊緊抓住讀者底注意、並且使讀者得到莊嚴美麗如聖詩般的印象、</p>
<h3>錫蓮特拉</h3>
<p>（Culeandra）是一部很値得注意的法譯小說、這是一本羅馬尼亞作品剛剛譯成法文的原著者萊伯蘭奴（Ｒedreanu）是羅馬尼亞最好的小說家之一、他這部（錫蘭特拉）是講到一個很有勢力的政治家底兒子、他殺死了他的妻子、於是他的父親、因爲要使他不至於受監禁之辱、就送他到瘋人院去、幽禁起來、却不料他進了瘋人院之後竟發起瘋來、變成一個眞的瘋子、這部小說底題材是可怕的、但在叙述上則顯有强動單純的特點、</p>

<h3>開辦小孩子戲劇學社的說明</h3>
<p>唐學詠</p>
<p>近數十年來我國治文藝的朋友對於戲劇的改革不能說不算熱心除了舊戲本身的改良不計外還有文明戲新劇等等的建立然则起初的努力者多半還只是戲劇界的先生們到了新文化運動時代乃有多量的文學巨子亦從事這項運動對於劇本或介紹或創作或批評不一而足眞個熱閙極了不過在這熱的高潮中大家忘却一件大事就是戲子之音樂之表演的基本技能與夫樂隊演奏家的專門敎育這些責任在歐美各國都各有他們國内之公立的或私立的大音樂院負擔若在我國眞想要辦一所近代式的歌劇塲像唱歌演奏表演幾項人才我們敢向那里去找呢不客氣恐怕還是我們小孩子戲劇學社自造的比較可靠比較省事罷所以我們的開辦小孩子戲劇學社立意只想造成一個小孩子戲班小孩子戲班者絕對不是兒戲他是從前曾經有過有所謂（娃娃班）不過敎育和藝術的内容彼此有精粗和繁簡的不同罷了即就娃娃班而言他也已經有過他不少的成績昭示給大家了我們將來的小孩子戲班是要由這小孩子戲劇學社拿更進步的更有把握的近代音樂專門敎育去造成他所以我們中國眞正要唱起見得世面的大歌劇來也就只有請大家先贊成我們這個娃娃班尤其是我們這小孩子戲劇學社</p>
<p>這里我們要鄭重的向大家申明幾句就是我們不相信世界上有欲速可逹的成功更不會有不勞而獲的善果所以對我們將來的小孩子班希圖他朞月可矣固然是太過簡單就是想他三年有成我們也不敢過於自信可是有一點我們敢相信的就是古今中外没有一個刮刮叫的音樂家或一個靈妙的表演員不是從我們稚齡的小朋友中出身有時簡直就在我們小朋友隊裏便跑出驚人的樂藝聖手來這就是通俗敬稱的所謂神童這個理由很簡單譬如一個音樂家必具的條件是要視明·聽聰·心靈·手敏這些等等老實只有我們小朋友纔有到逹的可能壯年人儘管你多麽專心致志簡直也没有多大希望這也是我們所以要開辦小孩小戲劇學社的理由</p>
<p>現在我要求談談我們小孩子戲劇學社的辦法說到辦法那更簡單我們暫時也不要堂而皇之的社屋也毌須成千累萬的國幣學費是不收書籍費也不要我們只想邀集一班有恒心有志願的小朋友無論在那一個學校借一間容積相當空氣不壤的敎室先把普通音樂常識讀譜記音和練聲幾種樂人必修的課程弄起來到了相當的時候我們就要辦一個會試從而甄别一班音樂天賦較多的小朋友分門别類各色各樣的大造起來一切導師都要到西洋去選聘一班頭二等敎援來擔任我說到這里一定有人喝聲道胡說這不是要把我們的民族整個兒斷送要給我們將來的藝人完全歐化這種辦法簡直是文化侵略者的工具我便扳起臉孔挺胸的應聲說且慢我們的要請西洋敎授絕對的要請西洋敎授只是要他們帮着我們小朋友抄着捷徑去求知求能不知其他我們以爲無論做什麽事情越想運用得巧妙越得要把那件事物整個兒認識淸楚纔有辦法而因此産生出來的東西纔像樣子物理然化學然藝術又何獨不然譬如一個畫師一定先要知道人體的結構和比例靜物的形像及動物的各種姿態纔能揮筆自如惟妙惟肖又如一個作曲家一定先要知道和聲的原理音調的對協與夫各種樂器音色的配製纔能得心應手運用得度所以我們所希望於那些西洋敎授只是要他們灌輪點音樂基本知識和技能使我們那班小朋友能自發自創而且那些敎授所能做得到的亦只有這一點要說他能斷送我們的民族性化移我們將來的藝人不要說那些書獃子（因爲西洋的敎授只知敎學不懂得利用學生鈎結同僚來搗亂校務把持飯碗）就是誰也没有這樣大的本領你只看從前日本什麽都跟着西洋跑眞所謂依樣葫蘆如法泡製然而他一切出品大家一望而知是東洋貨而不是西洋貨他們的樂曲我們一聽也曉得說是東洋調所以他們的摹仿西洋只有因之使他們的民族性發揚光大並没有因之把他斷送這大槪可以放心吧</p>
<p>到這里一定又有人說旣然如此那麽何心直接了當竟一起給這些小朋友·送到西洋去留學豈不更好我便頻頻點首敬應之曰誠然誠然只要這些小朋友的家屬都能坦然放懹讓這些小朋友浩浩蕩蕩漂洋過海而去又只要這些小朋友到學成的時候個個猶能不變初衷慾望不奢肯大家聚在一塊來替社會謀音樂的建設與衆樂樂與天下人同樂又只要有個賢明的政府好禮的富翁肯籌筆的欵使那些小朋友能安心在外求學不致不時地受經濟痛苦而能接續不斷的一氣學成假使對這種都有了辦法那我即刻撲通倒地第一個贊成倘使大家對上面幾種問題還有點疑問那麽簡直仍請贊成我們這個小孩子戲劇學社因爲我們相信我們到西洋去請十幾位敎師來帮我們造幾百學生究竟比派幾百學生到西洋去留學經濟上比較要省點事實上比較要困難少點就是希望他們將來學成仍聚在一塊做事亦比較的有把握點所以能夠一批批送小孩子出洋留學音樂我固然根本贊成不過我認爲我們這小孩子戲劇學社亦未嘗没有他相當的必要我們現在把開辦這學社的立意也說明白了大家能有的誤會也解答了惟有望大家多方的熱贊使這學社能一帆風順以抵有成總不能說是社會上一件無關重要的事罷</p>

<h3>Zhang Yichou Discusses the Problem of High Gold and Low Silver</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Yichou, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, said that the biggest reason for China's suffering from high gold and low silver is that the scope of domestic gold mines is too small, coupled with the manipulation of exchanges and unscrupulous merchants. According to a recent survey, between the years of the Republic of China 5 to 18, the amount of gold imported exceeded the amount of gold exported by 20 million US dollars. From the winter of the year 18 to the present, the amount of gold exported has reached 100 million US dollars, which is shocking. Although the Central Government has clearly banned the export of gold and the import of raw silver this year, it still cannot have a significant effect immediately. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has drafted a remedial plan based on this point. Later, the Central Political Council believed that this case should be decided by the responsible financial and industrial ministries, and the various materials obtained from the investigation should be submitted to the Central Government for reference in determining the measures.

<p>(Nanjing) China's new import and export tariff has long been revised and completed. Because it is related to the abolition of Likin, it should be determined after the new tax measures to compensate for the abolition of Likin are properly formulated. Therefore, the draft tariff will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for review next month at the same time as the Likin compensation tax plan. According to financial sources, all commercial treaties signed between China and various countries stipulate that there should be one tax for one item and no re-collection. Although the current customs tax rate has been changed, it has not increased much compared to the old rate. If the customs import tax is not increased after the abolition of Likin, the loss will be extremely significant. Therefore, the authorities will implement the new tariff and the abolition of Likin at the same time in order to seek fundamental remedies. (13th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Measures to Restrict Cipher Telegrams</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Communications telegraphed to the Telegraph Administration Bureaus of various provinces and cities on the 13th to restrict the sending of cipher telegrams by shops: (1) Cipher telegrams sent by shops shall not contain military or political news, except for reporting on commercial information. (2) When Chinese shops send commercial telegrams, they must be stamped with the seal of a reputable company or shop and signed by the manager. (3) Foreign shops must be certified by the consul with an official letter or signed by the consul before they can be sent. However, the codebook of the cipher telegram can still be inspected at any time if necessary. (4) Telegrams forwarded to foreign countries by telegraph bureaus and submarine cable companies shall also follow these rules. (5) The inspection procedures shall be as simple as possible to avoid making things difficult. (13th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Struggle Between Governments and Parliaments in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Today, in countries with parliamentary politics, there are few countries where there are no conflicts between the government and the parliament. Sometimes it is about maritime treaties, sometimes about national defense spending, and sometimes about financial relief. Parliament often expresses dissenting opinions, but the government cannot force the parliament to comply. For example, even though the German government today possesses the special power of Article 48 of the Constitution, it ultimately does not dare to try it lightly because using this special power to resolve matters will inevitably increase the parliament's resentment, and the result will still be nothing more than dissolving the parliament. However, dissolving and re-electing is not only cumbersome, but also difficult to guarantee that it will necessarily conform to the government's intentions. Therefore, the German government today is still hesitant. The French government, unable to resolve difficult problems, simply ordered an early recess, which aroused the combination of the opposition, leading them to regard this move as high-handed and tyrannical and determined to carry out a vote of no confidence. Therefore, a recess is also of no benefit to the French political situation. Generally speaking, although the struggle between the two sides today may not be entirely without selfish motives, it is largely to seek benefits for the country. Since there are no deep-seated hatreds that cannot be resolved, and they dare not confidently assert that their policies are necessarily beneficial and harmless, although they argue, they are all unwilling to resort to the last resort.</p>
<p>However, in this tide of parliamentary disputes, there is also an exception, namely the order issued by the King of Egypt today to dissolve the parliament. This is because the current dispute between the Egyptian conference and the government is purely for seizing power. One side wants to support the previous cabinet, and the other side wants to support the current cabinet. Those who support the previous cabinet launched a movement against the current government, and those who support the current cabinet launched a movement to suppress the parliament, which led to a great tragedy of conflict between the masses and the military police. The world only has these people who fight for power, who only know how to avenge their hatred and disregard the overall situation. No matter what kind of means, they can try to achieve their goals. Therefore, I say that the parliamentary struggle in Egypt cannot be compared with the struggles in other countries.</p>

<p>International Important News</p>
<h3>Egyptian King Orders Dissolution of Parliament</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Cairo, 12th, The Egyptian government has announced a royal decree dissolving the current parliament.</p>
<h3>German Cabinet Finance Bill</h3>
<p>Rejected by the Budget Committee</p>
<p>The Government May Submit it Directly to the General Assembly</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 12th, The situation of the German government in the parliament has not been very good in recent months, but it suddenly deteriorated today. The financial bill to make up for the budget deficit of this year has been rejected by the parliamentary budget committee. However, the cabinet is firmly refusing to make any further amendments at this time. According to this case, although it was compiled by the new Finance Minister Dietrich, most of it was based on the old case of former Finance Minister Modenhauer, now that the financial bills compiled by the three finance ministers (Hiphting of the Social Democratic Party, Modenhauer of the Nationalist Party, and Dietrich of the Democratic Party) have not been approved in the Federal Council and the Parliament, political circles expect the cabinet to submit the case to the Parliament for discussion next week without first passing the parliamentary finance committee. It is clear that the result of the General Assembly discussion will also meet the same fate, but at least it can give the Parliament another opportunity to review it, hoping to pass it by chance to avoid political disputes. If it still cannot be passed at that time, the government, in order to organize finances, is expected to resolutely present a request to the president to authorize the powers stipulated in Article 48 of the Constitution to promulgate the case by administrative order and then dissolve the parliament and hold elections in the autumn.</p>
<h3>French Parliament Recess Order</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Promote the Combination of Left-Wing Parties</p>
<p>Recognizing the Government's Move as a High-Pressure Tactic</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 12th, As expected, last night's sudden order for the French Parliament to recess immediately promoted the combination of left-wing opposition parties. They issued a joint declaration today, pointing out that the Prime Minister's move was a high-pressure tactic, no different from the cabinet's desperate flight, and that its impact on obstructing the work of the parliament would make the people distrust parliamentary politics. The organ newspaper of the Radical Party claimed that the Prime Minister's barbaric actions have already caused the opposition parties, which have never been consistent, to engage in combination, hoping to permanently maintain this new combination and jointly overthrow the cabinet after the parliament reopens.</p>
<h3>World Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>The Number of Unemployed Workers is Increasing in Various Countries</p>
<p>The Background of War is Becoming More Mature</p>
<p>Speech by the Secretary of the Central Committee of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Moscow News, Morosov, secretary of the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, spoke at the Communist Party Congress on the world economic crisis, stating that the world cotton industry has shown signs of great decline. Although the wholesale price has decreased, the standard of living in many countries has not been raised. The real labor value in many countries is lower than before the war. The total number of unemployed people in the capitalist countries was not long ago 17 million, and now it has exceeded 20 million and is still swelling. The world's economic crisis has made international resistance even more profound. On the one hand, capitalist countries have recently signed many commercial agreements, even France and Germany have signed one. On the other hand, the trend of protecting domestic markets is becoming more and more extensive, and protectionist trade is greatly strengthened. Most noteworthy is that the United States has adopted a policy of continuing to increase tariff rates, and in addition to dozens of foreign countries opposing this policy, more than 1,000 American economists have also joined the opposition. In the United Kingdom, a war is being waged over the establishment of an imperial tariff barrier. In terms of the whole of Europe, this activity is most concentrated in France, such as the plan for a European alliance, which is a preliminary expression in the European customs alliance led by France. The struggle for world hegemony between the United Kingdom and the United States is constantly intensifying, and the crisis of a new war is becoming increasingly urgent. The scope of this war will be larger than the last one because the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States have expanded to all continents. The background of the world crisis is becoming more and more complete, which means that the strength of the revolutionary movement will expand.</p>
<p>Washington News, The United States, known as the world's richest country, has as many as 6.6 million unemployed people. In addition, the United Kingdom has more than 2.8 million unemployed people, and Germany has 3 million. The three major industrial countries have a total of more than 11 million people. The following are recent news from various places as an appendix to see a glimpse.</p>
<p>According to London News, the recent number of unemployed people in the United Kingdom is 1,885,000, an increase of 110,000 in the last two weeks. This kind of unemployment is mostly due to the economic wave of the world, such as the decline in the production and consumption capacity of China and Russia and the disturbances in India.</p>
<p>Also, Berlin News, The total number of unemployed people in Germany in fact now exceeds 2 million, approaching 3 million.</p>
<p>Also, New York News, The American Unemployment Relief League, based on the results of scientific research, found that there are 6.6 million unemployed people in the United States today.</p>
<p>Also, Paris News, The number of unemployed people in France in April this year was only 1,200, almost no unemployed, and because the supply of labor was insufficient, workers were recruited from foreign countries. More than 170,000 workers entered the country last year, and 30,000 entered the country by the end of March this year. There are now more than 1,810,000 foreign workers active in France. (World)</p>
<h3>The Situation of the American Naval Treaty</h3>
<p>The Special Meeting Failed to Convene</p>
<p>There are Many in the Opposition</p>
<p>Washington, 12th (Associated Press) - Today, because senators opposed to the naval treaty refused to convene on Saturday, the Senate special meeting could not be held. President Hoover took advantage of today's free time to plan future courses of action with key figures supporting the government faction. According to investigations in the Senate today, the number of senators opposing the naval treaty is sufficient to prevent a quorum at any time. However, some opposition senators hope to reject the naval treaty within a week, while others believe that delay will be detrimental to the treaty. Opposition senators claim that they have already resolved to vote against the treaty, with a total of twenty-three senators. Senator Johnson still insists on reading all the secret documents of the naval treaty, saying that he can predict that the United States is being coerced by Britain to comply with all its wishes.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Decides to Consult on the Naval Treaty Issue</h3>
<p>The Foreign Minister Visits Saionji to Seek Understanding</p>
<p>Anbo is Summoned Back to the Country to Boost Momentum</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Japan United Press) - The Japanese government's attitude of consulting on the London Treaty has been decided. Therefore, the biggest problem for the Japanese government in the future is to open up strategies for the economic downturn. Prime Minister Hamaguchi, following the advice of Sentaro, President of the South Manchuria Railway, has been meeting with influential figures in the financial world to inquire about their opinions on the development of the situation.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Japan United Press) - Foreign Minister Shidehara left Tokyo for Okitsu yesterday afternoon to visit Prince Saionji. The Foreign Minister said in the train that he was scheduled to meet with Prince Saionji tomorrow. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has almost completed the preparations for the London Treaty and the documents will be printed within two or three days. He did not know what the opinions within the Navy were, but according to the trend of public opinion, there would be no damage to this treaty. In the event of a movement against the treaty, he would fight it thoroughly.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu) - Japanese advisor to the London Conference, General Anbo, remained in London after the conference concluded. He has now been summoned back to the country by Minister of Finance Zaibu and is scheduled to depart on the 14th via Siberia. This is because, in order to convene a meeting of military councilors, the supporters of the arms strength problem and the new national defense plan are currently only Zaibu, Taniguchi, and Okada. The opponents include Marshal Togo, Prince Fushimi, and former Minister Kato. If the votes for and against are equal, the decision-making power will naturally fall to the chairman, Marshal Togo. Therefore, the order for Anbo to return to the country is intended to attend the meeting to overcome the difficulties of the council meeting with a majority vote. This shows that the Japanese government is determined to disregard the opposition of the military and take consultation procedures with the Privy Council in one go. Therefore, future problems will depend on the attitude of the Privy Council.</p>
<h3>People's Party Deputies Propose Amendments to Roundtable Conference Funds</h3>
<p>Ultimately Passed by Majority</p>

<p>Simla, 12th (Reuters) - The Indian government was defeated in the Legislative Assembly today by sixty votes to forty-eight.

<h3>Turkish Rebels Defeated, British Officers Secretly Command</h3>
<p>Angora, 12th (National News Agency) - The Turkish Ministry of War announced that the Gur rebels in the Arara region had been defeated, with many deaths, and had retreated into Persian territory.

However, this statement has not yet been verified.</p>
<h3>The Gibraltar Strait Tunnel Project Becomes More Concrete</h3>
<p>Madrid, 12th (National News Agency) - The project to build a tunnel under the Strait of Gibraltar, connecting Europe and Africa, is becoming more concrete.

<h3>Postponement of Payment of Japanese Naval Budget Difficult to Implement</h3>
<p>The Authorities Propose a Second Plan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu) - The plan to postpone the payment of the naval budget is difficult to implement due to public criticism. The naval authorities have now formulated a second plan to reduce the amount of tightening from 12 million yen to 8.5 million yen, and to postpone the completion year of the supplementary ship for one year. This was presented to the Ministry of Finance yesterday. In this way, it is not necessary to cut 5 million yen from the Air Headquarters' expenses, nor is it necessary to dismiss naval workers or postpone payments. The Ministry of Finance said that if the austerity plan is not completed before the cabinet meeting on the 18th, it will be impossible to prepare the budget for the coming year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Recession</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu) - The Takeoka factory in Okayama Prefecture, which is operated by Fukushima Spinning Mill, has also dismissed 150 workers due to the impact of the market downturn. Those who have not been dismissed have stopped night work and deducted wages, causing widespread complaints.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu) - Tokyo Electric Light Company, which is undergoing fundamental reforms by Kosuke Kyosuke, has decided to change its system and save personnel expenses by dismissing 132 of its 2,300 employees. This was officially announced yesterday. The company, because there is unemployment panic in various places, will pay all dismissed employees a full year's salary.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Dentsu) - Sericulture families in Kamiina, Shinshu, also decided to limit summer and autumn silkworm eggs due to the disastrous decline in silk prices, and will stop work for one month from August 17.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Industry Promotes Domestic Goods, Chinese Straw Hats are Rejected</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Japan United Press) - Thirty influential local newspaper companies in Japan invited twenty-six representatives of production and sales stores and companies in the local area to the Marunouchi Industrial Club yesterday afternoon, and invited Minister of Commerce Hyosho and Vice-Minister Yokoyama to attend a meeting to discuss the issue of promoting domestic goods. After the Minister of Commerce gave an opening speech, he encouraged producers and sellers of domestic products and hoped that various newspaper companies would provide strong assistance.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese News, the raw materials (wheat straw) for straw hats produced in Hiroshima Prefecture are heavily stocked due to the market downturn. In order to engage in sales and prevent the import of Chinese raw materials, the industry is strongly advocating the use of domestic goods. Recently, the main hat-making businesses in the prefecture gathered to discuss changing the Chinese raw materials that have always been used to manufacture women's and children's hats to Japanese raw materials. As a result, it was recognized that although the quality of Japanese raw materials is inferior, the price is only half that of Chinese materials, making the cost lighter. It is planned to try manufacturing them and submit the existing goods to the prefectural government and the academic affairs department for consultation within two weeks, first persuading students in the prefecture to use them, and then promoting them to other prefectures and counties to seek new avenues for domestic raw materials.

<h3>Large Quantities of Bullion Secretly Shipped to Japan, Merchants Seek Only Profit</h3>
<p>Osaka, 13th (Dentsu) - The Osaka Mint has recently purchased a continuous stream of yellow goods shipped from China, amounting to more than 4 million yuan. It is said that some Chinese people bought them in Shanghai, hid them from customs, and shipped them to Japan. In Shanghai, they bought them for about 4.5 yen per money unit and shipped them to Japan via Manchuria, selling them to the mint for 5 yen per money unit.</p>
<h3>Bizarre French Plane Crash Case</h3>
<p>The Driver Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Suspected of Being a Member of the Anti-Fascist Party</p>
<p>Beirl, 12th (National News Agency) - Today, a bizarre French plane crashed into the Alps near the Reuss River in St. Gotthard. There was only one driver in the plane, who jumped out from 150 feet above the ground. Although seriously injured, he was not killed. He was rescued to Anteqing Hospital. Shortly after, he woke up for a moment and claimed to be an Italian named Geshe Nosi, who departed from Paris to Felingchana. Due to heavy fog, he mistakenly thought St. Gotthard was the Surbron Pass, causing the crash. The St. Gotthard glacier area is a Swiss national defense hub and is strictly forbidden to fly. Therefore, it was initially suspected that this person was an Italian spy privately spying on Swiss national defense, and public sentiment was quite indignant. Later, it was heard that on Friday afternoon, a plane in Milan, Italy, dropped about 100,000 flyers from a very high altitude denouncing the Fascist Party. At that time, the Milan authorities, in addition to deploying police and militia to prevent people from picking up the flyers, immediately dispatched several army planes to chase them, but they were eventually escaped. It was then expected that the plane that caused the accident was this plane. Moreover, it was found that the plane was registered in the name of the editor of Action Française, the Parisian royalist newspaper. The person was a famous anti-Fascist Party member. However, after further investigation, it was learned that the injured driver's real name was Basanis, and he had three passports with different names in his possession. His whereabouts were suspicious. Therefore, the truth of this case is still confusing.</p>
<h3>Argentinian Tram Crashes into River</h3>
<p>Driver Confused by Fog</p>

Only three people standing on the platform were rescued unharmed. Most of the victims were workers going to the factory. The bridge is a two-section suspension bridge, and the second section had not been lowered at the time. The driver was confused by the heavy fog and failed to see clearly, causing the disaster.</p>

<h3>News of the Military on the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>Xu-Xiangkou Town Was Looted by Bandits</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Since He Yaogu was ordered to command the various armies on the Jinpu Line, he has been actively deploying forces. However, there have been no fierce battles between the two sides. According to the reconnaissance report of the Second Air Squadron, most of the Jin army that went south was concentrated in the Tai'an Nanyi Feicheng Ningyang area and on both sides of the nearby railway. The Jin army suffered heavy losses after the central aircraft dropped bombs. The Quyan area is sometimes attacked by the Jin army, but the central army's defenses are solid and the Jin army has not succeeded. The enemy in Dong'a Pingyin is also numerous. They have suffered heavy losses after being bombed by the central aircraft.</p>
<p>Xiangkou, ninety miles west of Xuzhou, is a major town in northern Xiao and is also a station on the Longhai Railway with prosperous commerce. However, the bandit atmosphere in the Xiao border has been rampant in the past month. After Xiao County Magistrate Wang Fenyu and Fan Zichun, the commander of bandit suppression in Fengdang Xiao, jointly attacked with the police team and the self-defense regiment and the Fengdang police team, one of the bandit forces, about 400 to 500 people, suddenly rushed into Xiangkou at about 10:00 am on the 10th. It seemed that the bandits had clearly investigated beforehand, first knocking down the posts there and confiscating dozens of guns from the business group, and also confiscating a small number of garrison guns, and looting property. The bandits also overturned seven sections of the railway tracks at the 299-kilometer mark east of Xiangkou Station to prevent armored trains from coming to suppress them. At about 4:00 pm, they carried their belongings and fled south. After receiving the news, the railway immediately sent craftsmen to repair the tracks. It is said that there seemed to be communists within the bandit force. The officers and soldiers in the Xiao border are still continuing to suppress them (10th).</p>

<p>Deng Ying's Army Kills Huang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandits</p>
<p>Xiao County Magistrate Leads Troops to Recover Wanzai City</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence, 8th: Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province is a famous porcelain-producing area in China with more than 100,000 porcelain workers. It is known as one of the four major towns in the country. However, the town is located between Dexing, Leping, and Anhui Liyuan in eastern Jiangxi. Dexing and other counties have always been the areas where the communist bandits Fang Zhimin and Shao Shiping haunted eastern Jiangxi. Therefore, Jingdezhen has never been safe. According to a visitor from Raozhou (which borders Jingdezhen and is the only way to Jingdezhen from the province), Fang Zhimin has thousands of bandits. They once captured the Heikou town in Yiyang County and Dexing County when the garrison troops were transferred elsewhere. The Jiangxi Provincial Government transferred the Zeng Garrison Regiment and a police brigade to station in the Yiyang area. The Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui also sent a regiment of troops from Zhejiang to station in Heikou (a major town on the Xinjiang River) for a joint suppression. The communist bandits then sneaked into Fuliang Jingdezhen from Leping Dexing on the 6th of this month, and the news of the bandits capturing the town spread. On the morning of that day, yellow-uniformed troops and red and white flags were first discovered in the market of Jingdezhen. Outsiders who did not know the truth thought that the bandit suppression troops had arrived (the garrison regiment also wears yellow uniforms) and did not mind. Unexpectedly, after the bandits entered the town, they first opened the prison and released all the communist bandits and remaining criminals in custody. They then opened fire with rifles to demonstrate, and the order was disrupted for a while. The police team was caught off guard and most of the guns were confiscated. At that time, the people were having breakfast when they suddenly heard gunshots and closed their doors. Those in the streets also ran away. The bandits then shouted loudly and looted at will. At the same time, they attacked the county government, the public security bureau, the county party headquarters, and various public groups, searching for public officials from various agencies. The county magistrate, Li Jue, is missing. One said that he had fled the bandit area with his seal, and another said that he was killed by the bandits. Neither has been confirmed. In order to preserve their lives, the merchants in the town hired boats and fled to Raozhou (Poyang) to take refuge. After receiving the news, Poyang County Magistrate Jiang Bozhang transferred the entire county police team to the Fuliang border to defend the key points. Jiang himself took a boat from Poyang to the province yesterday to meet with Chairman Lu, Director Wang Min, and Division Commander Zhang, asking them to send troops to suppress them as soon as possible. Lu immediately agreed to dispatch a large team to aid them and ordered the garrison troops in Heikou and Yiyang to suppress them. Jiang returned to Poyang this morning to supervise the team's advance. According to a telegram from Division Commander Deng Ying yesterday, the communist bandit Huang Gonglue hated the two defeats in Yan and led bandits to attack Ji'an from Shengang Mountain, Tianhua Mountain, and Zhenjun Mountain in three directions. Division Commander Deng fought to the death, killing more than 600 bandits and seizing more than 100 guns, spears, and banners. The fake chief commander and student army commander Li Xueshen was killed on the spot, and the remaining bandits fled to Tongwuping and Gujiang. The floating bridges and more than a dozen bandit boats prepared for crossing the river built by the bandits in Yanzigang were also destroyed by the Minzu and Minquan ships.</p>
<p>Wanzai in northern Jiangxi has been repeatedly captured by bandits. After the new county magistrate, Xiao Jiaxiu, took office in Xujiadu, Shanggao, he organized a temporary government in Lujiazhou in Wanjing and led troops to recover the county seat a few days ago. The bandits occupying the city have retreated to Zhudu, Gaochengbin, etc.</p>

<p>Important News II</p>
<h3>Qingdao Merchants Demolish the Local Goods Unified Tax Bureau</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The Qingdao Local Goods Unified Tax Bureau was established when Zhang Zongchang was Governor of Shandong. The tax levies were onerous, and merchants hated it to the bone. However, at that time, under the military閥威, they dared to be angry but dared not speak out and could only endure it in pain. When Zhang's defeat occurred in the Jinan Temple Incident in 1928, the provincial government changed hands, and the Qingdao Goods Unified Tax Bureau also stopped operating invisibly. During May 1929, the National Government sent Chen Zhongfu to Qingdao to completely take over the municipal government. In August, Chen Diaoyuan, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, sent personnel to Qingdao to continue handling the goods unified tax affairs and handled the case according to the regulations organized during the Zhang Zongchang era. This aroused opposition from all walks of life, saying that the regulations formulated by Zhang were harsh taxes imposed on the people by the old warlords, and it was not appropriate to imitate the old warlords to provoke public resentment under the banner of Qingbai. Seeing the strong opposition from the merchants, the Shandong Provincial Government did not dare to execute it decisively. They sent personnel to negotiate with the municipal government, and after several twists and turns, they finally reached a compromise to reduce the tax rate by 30% compared with the tax rate set by Zhang to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants. At the same time, 20% of the tax revenue was allocated annually to subsidize Qingdao municipal government's development of municipal administration. As a result, the bureau was officially established. Although merchants did not openly resist at that time, they still resented the authorities. Now that Zhao Huipeng has come to be the head of the bureau this spring, the bureau often uses private individuals to extort money, resulting in widespread complaints. Recently, the bureau has also distributed bonuses to employees, but some employees believe that it is unfair, resulting in disputes that have given people an opportunity. Moreover, the political situation in Shandong has changed, and the bureau's collection of taxes has become even stricter than before. The general merchants have long harbored resentment, and at this point, they could no longer bear it. At about 5 pm today (the 10th), more than 300 people gathered, holding wooden sticks. They first demolished the two tax collection branches of the bureau near the Dagang Wharf and then gathered at the bureau and rushed in, demolishing all the doors, windows, glass, tables, chairs, and appliances. The debris was scattered all over the ground. Seeing that the situation was bad, all the bureau's employees hid, so no one was injured. When the incident occurred, the nearby police officers tried to stop it but were ineffective, so they reported to the police station in charge. When the police station sent police to arrive, the merchants had dispersed. It is heard that after receiving the report, the Public Security Bureau sent people to investigate the names of the instigators and will arrest and interrogate them. It is also heard that several people have been arrested. The Qingdao office of the Shandong Provincial Government is paying close attention to this matter. In addition to summoning the director of the bureau, Zhao Huipeng, to inquire about the details of the incident, it has also sent a letter to the municipal government to handle it properly.

<h3>A Record of the Battle of Hengyang</h3>
<p>The 8th Route Army Defeats Zhang Guijun's Army</p>
<p>Qiyang Military News: After withdrawing from Changsha, Zhang Guijun's army fled towards You, Li, An, and Lei, and then crossed the river from Songbai, Baifang, and Jiangkoutang and attacked Hengyang in three routes, plotting to defeat the 8th Route Army and then attack Changsha again. The front was commanded by Zhang Fakui and Tang Zheming's 48th and 2nd armies, attacking Santang from Qitang. Li Yi was the entire 7th Army of Yang Tenghui, attacking Xinqiao from Huilong Temple. The right wing was the entire 15th Army of Huang Shaoxiong, attacking Chejiang from Quanhu. The 8th Route Army also divided into three routes to meet the attack, with Li Baobing's 53rd Division attacking the enemy's left wing from Yinpi and Xinqiao, Li Yangjing's 63rd Division attacking the enemy's right wing from Maotongqiao, and Jiang Guangnai personally leading the Jiang and Cai Divisions to attack the enemy's front. Fierce battles broke out on all three routes on the 29th. The central army bravely charged, and the enemy also resisted stubbornly, causing many casualties on both sides. That night, the 157th Brigade of Li Baobing's division had occupied Songjiaqiao, and Li Yangjing's division approached Qitang. The Jiang and Cai Divisions occupied Wutang. At dawn on the 30th, the central army launched a full-scale attack, charging forward one after another. Zhang Yougu of the central air force also piloted aircraft to drop bombs to help fight. After several hours of fierce fighting, the 159th Brigade of the 53rd Division first occupied Tanhe, killing many enemies. The enemy retreated from Danzichuan to Quanhu, and the brigade pursued fiercely, causing the enemy to shake the entire line. The Jiang and Cai divisions also attacked Qitang fiercely. The enemy was attacked from all sides and suffered heavy losses, so they sent a part to bypass the right wing of the 8th Route Army, trying to take Xinqiao by surprise and copy out the rear roads of Santang and Sitang to harass the Jiang, Cai, and Li divisions. They were again repelled by the combined efforts of the 157th and 8th brigades of the 53rd Division. Seeing that their plan was unsuccessful, the enemy used all their strength to attack Huilong Temple and Quanhu, but were repelled by the efforts of the Jiang and Cai divisions. The two sides held each other, and the sound of gunfire never stopped all night. At dawn one day, the enemy counterattacked fiercely. Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Fakui, Yang Tenghui, and others personally commanded on the front line, and the division commanders Jiang, Cai, Li, and Li supervised the battle with even greater force. From morning to noon, the enemy was completely defeated and fled towards Qiyang and Lingling. Huilong Temple, Quanhu, and other places in Qitang were occupied by the 53rd, 61st, and 63rd divisions at noon. In this battle, a total of 6,000 to 7,000 enemies were annihilated, and countless military supplies were seized. Gui army division commander Liang Chongxi was killed on the spot. His body was carried to Qiyang, where a coffin was purchased for 50 yuan and buried. Bai Chongxi and Yang Tenghui were both seriously injured. This time, the enemy army suffered more than half of the casualties and lost all their essence, and no longer had the ability to harm the Party and the country.</p>
<h3>He Jian Reports on the Battle Progress (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Strategies of Both Armies in the Fierce Battle of Hengzhou</p>
<p>Three Reasons for the Defeat of the Zhang-Gui Armies</p>
<p>Secondly, the rebel army uses every means to exploit the common people who formerly belonged to the communists. They always claim that rebels like Li, Bai, and Huang are absolutely against communism. I myself used to believe that they could thoroughly eradicate communism, but judging from their current actions, that is completely wrong. In some places, they are no different from the communists. The Communist Party's plan to invade the East and communize China is to provoke internal strife in China and take the opportunity to riot, especially targeting Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek with all their might (the Communist Party) because they believe that only Commander-in-Chief Chiang can maintain the current situation in China. If Chiang falls, there is no one else who can maintain the situation, and their (the Communist Party's) plan to invade the East and communize China can succeed. We have seen the Communist Party's disruptive plans. They (the Communist Party) are extremely eager to take advantage of the current domestic chaos to seize Wuhan and shake the central government, thereby overthrowing Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Hunan, because of its strong anti-communist efforts, is regarded by them (the Communist Party) as a particularly strong reactionary force. They must first disrupt Hunan and destroy the Hunan-Hubei transportation routes; otherwise, Wuhan will not be easily obtained. Therefore, when the Gui army was wreaking havoc in Hunan, the communists used all their strength to riot in various parts of Hunan, echoing the Gui army from afar. At the same time, rebels like Li, Bai, and Huang also took advantage of the communist riots in various parts of Hunan to enter Hunan, hoping to seize Wuhan and shake the central government, thereby overthrowing Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek, echoing the communists from afar. Rebels like Li, Bai, and Huang and the communists share the same goals of disrupting Hunan, seizing Wuhan, shaking the central government, and overthrowing Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, their actions are also as unscrupulous as those of the communists. Knowing that Hunan Province has suffered deeply from the scourge of the communists and cannot withstand further disruption, they still recklessly entered Hunan and wreaked havoc. Furthermore, Bai Chongxi declared that under the banner of overthrowing Chiang, anyone could cooperate, including the Communist Party. There is evidence to prove that the rebels Bai and others cooperated with the communists. He once sent people to recruit Peng Dehuai's troops. Our army found symbols of Peng's troops on the battlefield. There is no reason why such unscrupulous use of communists who kill, set fires, and commit arson would not fail. This is the second fundamental reason for the rebel army's failure. Thirdly, the rebel army has become the public enemy of the people. This time, the rebel army seized Changsha and completely destroyed all the political systems that Hunan had painstakingly built. The public and private losses are countless. Furthermore, they instigated the communists to wantonly cause trouble in Pingjiang, Liuyang, Nanhua, and Jinfeng, causing losses of no less than several million. The 30 million people of Hunan suffered greatly from this rebel army. Except for those who joined the rebels and opportunists, no one did not hate the rebel army with gnashing teeth. Since the rebel army has become the public enemy of the people of Hunan, there is no reason why it would not fail. This is the third fundamental reason for the rebel army's failure. Based on these three fundamental reasons for the rebel army's failure, it should have been completely annihilated. Although one-third of it still remains in Hunan and has not been completely eliminated, the remnants who fled back to their old nest in Guangxi will certainly no longer exist because the fleeing remnants are only about 10,000 people, and their command is no longer unified. The Fourth and Eighth Route Armies have already tracked and pursued them, and Commander-in-Chief Chen of Guangzhou has gone to Wuzhou to intercept them. Commander-in-Chief Long of Yunnan is also attacking from the rear. It is expected that the rebel army can be completely annihilated soon. As for the task of suppressing the rebels in Hunan Province, it has now come to a complete end. After the task of suppressing the rebels in Hunan comes to an end, there are many things that should be done actively to reorganize and deal with the aftermath. In the future, we will implement them step by step. The most urgent work that needs to be done at present, in my opinion, includes the following three points: (1) Eliminate the remnants of the rebel army. Many rebel soldiers fled in defeat this time. I have ordered all county regiments and bureaus to follow instructions to collect the scattered guns of the remnants. According to reports, many have already been collected. In the next month or two, the government will definitely pay attention to actively handling this matter to thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the rebel army to avoid harming the local area. (2) Eliminate the remnants and reactionary elements. All those who rebelled, joined the rebels, and willingly combined with the rebel army must of course be thoroughly eliminated. In addition, there are also some reactionary elements who colluded with the rebel army to disrupt their hometowns, as well as opportunists with weak wills, who should also be punished separately because if there were no reactionary elements colluding with them, the rebel army would never dare to enter Hunan, and even if they committed crimes in Hunan, it would not be so great. If there were no opportunists who joined the rebels, the rebel army would not be able to commit crimes, and even if they did, they would not be so fierce. These two types of people do not understand obedience or rebellion, destroy their hometowns, and have no understanding of our party, so they cannot but be punished separately to uphold justice. (3) Eliminate the wicked Communist bandits. The wicked Communist bandits are echoing the rebel army from afar and taking the opportunity to cause trouble. I saw in a newspaper published by the rebel army in Yongzhou that Pingjiang and Liuyang had fallen into the hands of the Communist bandits and were about to attack Changsha, etc.</p>
<p>It is a kind of gloating tone, deeply wishing that the Communist bandits would invade Changsha. It can be seen that the rebel army and the Communist bandits are indeed mutually exploiting each other. Now that the suppression of the rebels in Hunan Province has come to an end, in the past, because of the relationship of suppressing the rebels, most of the troops were diverted and could not fully eradicate the communists. Now that two-thirds or more of the rebel army has been eliminated in Hunan Province, and the remnants who fled to Guangxi will also be annihilated soon, in the future, more troops can be transferred to actively eradicate the communists. A complete plan for eradicating the communists is being prepared. The central government has also ordered the Fourth Route Army to continue eradicating the communists after suppressing the rebels. I have absolute confidence in eradicating the communists in the future. As long as we can continue to work hard according to the plan, I believe it will be very easy to annihilate them. However, eradicating the communists is not something that can be achieved by pure military force. It requires all the people to unite and cooperate to succeed. The Communist Party is absolutely uncompromising and does not recognize relatives and friends. The Communist Party has no central government; its motherland is the Soviet Union. We have seized a resolution of the Communist Party's four provinces, which contains many conspiracies to deceive the people. It will be printed and distributed soon so that everyone can understand the treacherousness of the Communist bandits. One item says that only poor peasants and hired laborers are the proletariat, and special attention should be paid to preventing poor peasants and hired laborers from becoming rich peasants. This method of deceiving farmers is extremely powerful because it believes that in this way, poor peasants and hired laborers will never become rich peasants, that is, they will always be driven by the Communist Party and always be anesthetized by it. Recently, the Communist bandits have been driving the people to the front in battles with the government troops. Therefore, although many Communist bandits have been killed in Pingjiang and Liuyang recently, many of the people who were forced to act as vanguards by the Communist bandits have also been killed. In our future communist eradication, we hope that the farmers and workers who have been deceived by the Communist bandits will unanimously awaken and cooperate with the government troops to vigorously eradicate the communists so that they can live and work in peace and contentment. Therefore, in our future communist eradication, in addition to military force, the most important work is to awaken the farmers and workers in various places to unanimously cooperate with the government troops to work hard to eradicate the communists. The above three items are the most urgent work in Hunan at present. We must do our best to consolidate the security of Hunan. Consolidating the security of Hunan is consolidating the security of the two lakes. Consolidating the security of the two lakes is consolidating the central government. If we want to sincerely support the central government, we should start by working hard to consolidate the security of Hunan. This is what I and the responsible comrades of the party, government, and military should pay special attention to. I originally had a few more days to stay in Hengyang because Director He's guidance in Hunan to suppress the rebels has come to an end. There are still many important matters in Wuhan that need to be handled by Director He when he returns to Wuhan. I will have to return to Wuhan soon. Because I also have many matters concerning all the important issues in Hunan Province to discuss and request instructions from Director He, I rushed back to Changsha yesterday. As for the remnants of the rebel army who fled to Guangxi, I have assigned troops to track them. They arrived at Huangsha River on the fourth of this month and may have chased them to Quanzhou yesterday. Since the military affairs have come to an end, there is no need to go to Hengyang again. From now on, I will do my best in the province to first engage in the above three tasks. This time, the rebel army wreaked havoc in Hunan.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The losses were enormous. I feel very uneasy in my heart and should apologize and take responsibility to the 30 million people of Hunan. We have learned a great lesson from the past. In the future, we should strive to improve in order to build a new Hunan of the Three Principles of the People. As long as we can all strive from now on, I believe that the losses suffered this time can be recovered quickly. If you have any opinions on how Hunan should improve in the future, I hope you will contribute them at any time to jointly govern it. Especially, you must earnestly perform the tasks assigned to you in your respective responsibilities. In short, as long as we always stand on the position of the party, support the central government, and uphold justice, the national revolution will definitely succeed, and the suffering of the people will definitely be relieved. This is a great hope that I have for you today. Director He came to Hunan this time on the order of the central government to guide the suppression of the rebels. Because his strategy was thorough, he was able to achieve great victories in the shortest period of time. The people of Hunan have benefited greatly. It is heard that he will have to return to Wuhan within a few days. At that time, we will notify all sectors to send him off to express our respect. (End)</p>
<h3>Communist Party Organ Discovered in Jiujiang</h3>
<p>More than Ten Important Organs</p>
<p>More than Twenty Important Figures</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication Jiujiang is an important town on the Yangtze River and also the gateway to Jiangxi. Therefore, the Communist Party has long wanted to take this as a base in Jiangxi. Important figures such as Zhang, Shu, etc. came to Xun one after another to set up more than twenty movement organs. All of them were discovered last month by the Eighteenth Division's resident Xun military police inspection office. More than twenty important Communist Party figures and dozens of party members were arrested and interrogated by the division's law enforcement office and executed separately. Yesterday, Zhang Huizan reported the matter to the central government. After receiving the report, the central government has transferred it to award commendations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Jisheng Association's Achievements in Disaster Relief in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>And Accommodating Thousands of Disaster-Stricken Children</p>
<p>Shaanxi Disaster Situation News Agency reported on June 25 that the disaster situation in Shaanxi has long been known to people at home and abroad. Philanthropists have sent personnel to Shaanxi one after another to distribute relief funds. The Shanghai Jisheng Association sent personnel to Shaanxi earlier than others. Director Zhang Xianqing of the association and other enthusiastic philanthropists came to Shaanxi in August last year and personally went to the Xianyang, Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, and Mei counties in the province to conduct on-site inspections of the disaster situation. However, Wugong, Fufeng, and other counties were more severely affected than other places. Using the method of disaster relief as urgent as putting out a fire, winter relief funds were released first in the shortest possible time, and relief fund distribution committee members were invited to go to Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, and other counties to investigate household by household and distribute seeds according to different grades. Mr. Zhang also set up several shelters to accommodate ordinary disaster victims who were crying for food, had their families ruined, and were displaced on the roads. He also organized burial squads to specialize in burying those who died on the roads. Since Mr. Zhang came to Shaanxi, he has been planning day and night, sparing no effort to rescue our hundreds of thousands of displaced and helpless disaster victims from deep water and fiery heat. However, because the disaster was widespread and the funds were limited, he returned to Shanghai last winter to appeal and reported the distribution process to the Shanghai General Association. The major philanthropists of the association learned about the tragic disaster situation in Shaanxi and did their best to appeal to all parties to raise funds. They also invited Director Zhang to come to Shaanxi again in April this spring with the committee members, wading through hardships and dangers, to distribute emergency relief funds and seeds to Wugong. The disaster victims were overjoyed. Mr. Zhang also collected a total of thousands of disaster-stricken children in Xian, Xianyang, Xingping, Wugong, Fufeng, Qishan, and other counties. All of them were homeless. It is heard that the tens of thousands of dollars in relief funds that Mr. Zhang brought have been distributed and he and the distribution committee members will return to the east to raise funds on the day of .</p>
<h3>Zhu Qinglan Arrives in Changchun and Harbin to Raise Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Lecturing in Changchun on the Disaster in Shaanxi</p>
<p>70,000 Yuan Has Been Raised in Harbin</p>
<p>Changchun Communication Mr. Zhu Qinglan, who is in charge of handling the disaster in Shaanxi, arrived in Changchun on the 1st. That afternoon, he reported the tragic disaster situation in Shaanxi to all sectors of society at the General Chamber of Commerce. More than 300 people attended, mostly from the business community. Before the lecture, Mr. Zhu placed various foods of disaster victims from various counties on a table. The foods were made of tree bark or grass roots, and they were extremely rough and inedible. There were stone noodles from Liuba County, elm bark noodles from Chang'an County, locust bean seeds from Qishan County, lacquer noodles from Moshan County, wild wattle heads from Weinan, maiden vines from Sanyuan County, etc., more than twenty kinds. The venue was plastered with slogans urging donations, such as "Three yuan saves a life," "Smoking one less ounce of opium can save a life," "Not smoking cigarettes for a month can save a life," "The happiest thing in the world is to donate money to help relief," "Don't forget our dying compatriots," "Relief is a natural expression of pain and suffering," "Rickshaw pullers have donated all the money they earned in a day of blood and sweat," "Saving one more compatriot adds one more point of vitality to the country," "Saving compatriots' own hearts, come and help with relief quickly," "Saving lives is a noble virtue," "Donate relief funds according to your economic ability, come quickly, save lives, save lives," "Compassion is the manifestation of human nature," "Everyone think about the dire situation, saving a bottle of perfume is saving many lives," "Saving a life is better than building a high pagoda," etc., more than dozens of kinds. In addition, Mr. Zhu took videos of the disaster situation in various places he passed through to publicize them. The exhibits at the venue included disaster victims peeling bark in Liquan County, shelters for disaster-stricken children, shelters for women, disaster victims starving to death in Xingping County, and the starvation of disaster victims in Wugong, Ganquan, Pucheng, Fuping, and Huayin Gaoling counties, etc.</p>
<p>After Mr. Zhu arrived, Chairman Sun of the Chamber of Commerce introduced him and he began his lecture, saying in brief: (Ladies and gentlemen, the disaster in Shaanxi is extremely serious. I am grateful to you for your enthusiastic relief efforts. I am here to (1) report on the distribution of relief funds and (2) thank you on behalf of the disaster victims. A few years ago, the Northeast transported grain to help relief efforts, which was the earliest and most enthusiastic, buying a total of 1.5 million shi of relief grain. Recently, another 100,000 shi. In the past, it could not move forward after arriving in Fengtai, but fortunately, Yan Xishan took care of it and it was transported directly to Lingbao. Shaanxi hopes for the relief efforts from the Northeast very much. The round trip to Lingbao is very smooth. I personally escorted the cars back and forth. Some people said that when they arrived in the war zone, there were incidents of deducting grain and cars. This is purely a rumor. I can guarantee that there is absolutely no such thing. However, because the relief funds have reached the end of the railway after being transported to Lingbao, it is even more difficult to transport them to Shaanxi. After boarding the ship from Lingbao, it is necessary to borrow the east wind to sail west to Weinan. It takes three or four days to reach Xi'an, and then it is dragged by rickshaws. The relief association uses cars to transport it. Transportation is inconvenient, but grain can still be purchased in Shanxi. Local millet costs three yuan to buy one dou. One dou of rice can feed one person for two months. Three yuan saves a life, that's what it means. After seeing this situation, the brothers and others knew that donating money for relief was faster than transporting grain. So, I and the manager of the Liuhegou Coal Mine jointly contributed 12,000 yuan, and the local government contributed 6,000 yuan to buy rice for emergency distribution. Then, I returned to Ping to urge relief efforts. This time, I entered Shaanxi to inspect the tragic situation. I couldn't bear to see it. Only in the villages of Xingping, Liquan, and Xianyang, the houses were demolished, the trees were gone, and the people were as thin as firewood, with faces as pale as vegetables, without any vitality. Most of them were starving on the road. There were more than thirty families, and twenty or more of them had died. Only one cow was left out of five livestock. They relied on horse teeth, cow eyes, and ash sticks to survive every day. After eating, they suffered from indigestion, leading to headaches and bone pain, and the rapid spread of plague. There were no doctors, no medicine shovels, and no resources to support them. What else could they do but die? I also saw dogs eating people in a temple. After I hired people to roll them up in mats, they were buried. The bodies of those who starved to death along the way were everywhere and countless. Therefore, I also appealed to the medical community to donate medicines. A trainload has been transported, but not many. Only Liquan County has 700 villages, and each village needs ten doses, which also requires 7,000 doses. We can only do our best to donate more medicines. I didn't dare to stay long on my second trip to Shaanxi and hurried back. As for the children being sold, according to a survey in Tongguan, there are more than 200,000 people. The various shelters accommodate 20,000 old and young. The disaster area is so large, 2 million disaster victims need 6 million yuan. Fortunately, humanity has not died, and the people are automatically and enthusiastically donating. Laborers and beggars have also donated. As for the exchange fees for relief funds, I will bear them all. All the people who donate money will make the disaster victims enjoy the benefits, and I hope that all the philanthropists who donate money can personally follow the grain trucks to the disaster area to inspect. It is not easy to gather with you today. Because of the short time, I will not say much. I hope that what I said today will be widely publicized to achieve a great effect. Publicizing is also saving the disaster. (3rd)</p>
<p>Harbin Communication General Zhu Qinglan arrived in Harbin at 8:00 a.m. yesterday (2nd) to raise relief funds for the disaster in Shaanxi. He is staying at the residence of Ma Ziyuan (former manager of the Bank of China's Harbin branch) at No. 6 Jilin Street. He plans to stay in Harbin for two days. On the 4th, he will transfer to Heilongjiang. Because he received a telegram from the Tianjin North China Charity Federation urging him to return to Tianjin quickly, Zhu will stay in Heilongjiang for a maximum of two days and then return south to Tianjin via the Tao'an Road. At 10:00 p.m. last night (2nd), Zhu responded to the invitation of the French-Chinese Shaanxi Disaster Relief Entertainment Association and reported on the disaster situation in Shaanxi at the East China Railway Club, saying that the disaster area is very large and relief efforts must continue. About 2 million Shaanxi people are waiting for relief, and it is estimated that it will take 6 million yuan to save one life with three yuan. The North China Charity Federation has only raised 500,000 yuan, which is a huge difference, etc. The report lasted forty minutes before it was over. At 4:00 p.m. on the 3rd, he reported at the Binjiang Chamber of Commerce outside the Daowai. At 10:00 a.m. on the 4th, he reported at the General Chamber of Commerce in the Daoli.

<h3>Tragic Car Accident at the Eighth Station of Harbin</h3>
<p>Four Deaths in the Hospital</p>
<p>Russian Gatekeeper Arrested</p>
<p>Harbin Communication on the 3rd. A tragic car accident occurred at the intersection of the Eighth Station on the evening of the 30th, resulting in the death of more than 20 people. According to the police station's inquiry, Li Junhua and Li Yun, clerks of Yongheng Tong, who were slightly injured, said that Car No. 548 that night was indeed because the gate was not fully closed, and they saw that the train was backing up very slowly. They wanted to take the opportunity to cross, but they broke into the intersection from the west end. When they reached the east end, the gate at the exit was closed and they could not get out. So they temporarily drove to the road above the unclosed gate on the east end. At this time, the train was approaching. The car driver panicked and wanted to back up, but it was too late. In an instant, it was overturned and crushed four or five feet away. The car box was completely crushed. The injuries and deaths of the passengers in the car were caused by the broken car box, mutual trampling, and collision. According to Li's testimony, the gatekeeper was not without fault. Therefore, the next morning, one of the gatekeepers, Shi Liemieff, was arrested. However, the man cried out that he was only responsible for opening and closing the gate at the west intersection. After closing one gate that night, he was about to close the other gate, but Car No. 548 had already crashed in. He used a red light to stop the car driver, but the driver ignored it, which led to the tragedy. But this incident was purely the negligence of the car driver, and he had no responsibility. The authorities did not release him because the matter was under investigation. However, they ordered the Detective Bureau and other departments to arrest the runaway driver Liu Tingyan as soon as possible for interrogation. It is heard that Liu was not the driver of Car No. 548. Because the driver of the car, Xu Feng, was ill, he took a leave of absence that day. Liu was the son-in-law of the car director, Xin Fu, and was only 19 years old. He had driven long-distance buses before. He had nothing to do that day, so he drove instead of Xu. Because he was not familiar with the traffic order in the city, he caused the accident. After the accident, several ribs were broken. He feared punishment and ran away in pain. The police searched for him, but he was nowhere to be found. Therefore, this case could not be concluded for a while because Liu had not been arrested. As for the injured in the hospital, Ma Zhensheng (a car driver in his twenties who had recently lost his job) died on the way that night. Not long after being admitted to the hospital, Li Xiaoshan (manager of Xiaoshan Bookstore) died. The next morning at 5:00 a.m., Sheng Guitian, an executive of a clothing store, died of serious injuries. On the morning of the 3rd, a Korean, Li Fengyun (about 20 years old), died. The other seven injured are being treated, but the doctor said there is no danger. A female student died on the spot that night. According to a detailed investigation, her name was Zhao Qinglian, 13 years old. She was studying at the Second Middle School Affiliated Elementary School. Her father, Zhao Fengqi, had a lot of wealth and had three children. Qinglian was the oldest. Recently, his youngest son died and Zhao was restless. He ordered his younger brother Zhao Sheng and his wife to take Qinglian to the Daoli Park for a walk. Unexpectedly, they encountered a sudden disaster on the way back. Zhao Sheng was slightly injured and felt ashamed of his brother and did not know where to go. Zhao Sheng's wife had her left leg crushed and became disabled.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Construction Department Plans to Dredge the Qiangwei and Houshu Rivers</h3>
<p>In recent years, there have been floods and droughts in Jiangbei. Many people believe that it is caused by the disrepair of the Grand Canal. However, to treat the Grand Canal, it is necessary to first treat the Huai, Yi, Si, and Shu rivers, which require huge amounts of money. Over the years, there has been no power to carry out the project. If this continues, the future of Jiangsu Province will be unimaginable. In view of this, the Construction Department plans to carry out construction in stages according to the economic situation. The Qiangwei and Houshu rivers are located in the lower reaches of the Shushui River and the tail of the central canal. They have been silted up for many years and need to be dredged urgently. It has specially consulted with the Lianguan Haishu Engineering Bureau to jointly plan the dredging method. Agreement has been reached. The Engineering Bureau will allocate 100,000 yuan. The Construction Department will allocate 100,000 yuan from the Yunmu donation (this Yunmu donation is collected from 25 counties in Huaiyang Xuhai according to the number of acres as special funds for treating the Yi Canal and Li Canal) over two years. If it is not enough, it will be subsidized by Donghai and Shuyang counties. Special accounts will be stored as funds for dredging the two rivers. At present, the Water Conservancy Bureau is organizing a construction survey team, which will depart immediately, and a telegram has been sent to the Engineering Bureau to send representatives to Zhen as soon as possible to discuss everything and actively carry out the project. It is expected that construction can start this autumn.</p>
<h3>A Plea from Overseas Chinese Merchants in Ecuador</h3>
<p>Regarding the Case Against Consul-General Chen</p>
<p>Correspondence from Ecuador states that the case involving the Chinese Nationalist Party branch in Guayaquil accusing Consul-General Chen Xintang of thirteen offenses has been drawn out for a long time. The National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs instructed the embassy in Peru to send Commissioners Wu Kewei and Pan Bingrong to Ecuador to investigate. Overseas Chinese merchants were greatly astonished upon hearing this. Recently, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador held a banquet for Wu and Pan. Board members from various Chinese merchant associations and representatives from various ports gathered and immediately issued a declaration, the text of which is as follows: (Upon investigation, we find that Chinese people have come to Ecuador for over forty years. Ever since the prohibition against Chinese entering the country, the Ecuadorian government has frequently imposed harsh regulations on Chinese and has often engaged in acts of humiliation. The various forms of unequal treatment are painful to speak of. Fortunately, our overseas Chinese deeply understand the greater good and know that in this country without a treaty, survival is impossible without uniting and planning self-defense together. Therefore, we combined our efforts and organized the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador. Mr. Chen Xintang has been elected as chairman by the overseas Chinese community for over ten years. He has handled chamber of commerce affairs and overseas Chinese affairs in an orderly manner. He has been appropriate both internally and externally, without any actions beyond the bounds of propriety or any acts of oppression. Furthermore, Mr. Chen was appointed as Honorary Consul-General in Ecuador by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of China. Subsequently, upon the request of the overseas Chinese community in Ecuador, the Ecuadorian government recognized him, and he officially took office in May of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, serving for six years since then. He has been clean and devoted to public service and has effectively protected the overseas Chinese community. His political achievements are evident and widely praised. However, with the prohibition still in place, harsh treatment is inevitable. Only Consul-General Chen has taken on the arduous task of either eliminating it invisibly or stopping it from developing further. Therefore, the precarious situation of the overseas Chinese community has relied on him for peace and stability until now. Thus, Consul-General Chen is truly a great protector of the overseas Chinese community. We believe that Mr. Chen has always held the ambition to love his country and his community, feeling the suffering of others as his own. Moreover, he is amiable, upright, selfless, and does not distinguish between us and them or differentiate by region. We deeply understand Mr. Chen's character and political achievements. We only uphold justice and unanimously support him. We will never allow anyone to slander him. In addition to requesting the chairman of our Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador to explain the detailed circumstances to Mr. Wu and Mr. Pan one by one and report the situation to our government to prevent slander and maintain the overseas Chinese community, we respectfully submit this declaration, dated the 19th year of the Republic, May 10th.) In addition to sending this declaration to Wu</p>
<p>and Pan, the General Chamber of Commerce will also prepare a clarification document and request Wu Kewei to forward it to Wei, the Acting Envoy in Peru, who will then forward it to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The original text is omitted.</p>
<p>After Commissioners Wu and Pan left, the overseas Chinese community repeatedly requested the General Chamber of Commerce to convene a general meeting in order to thoroughly plan and avoid disputes within the overseas Chinese community. Therefore, the chamber convened an emergency special meeting of overseas Chinese representatives in Ecuador on May 24. Representatives from various ports attended the meeting and unanimously passed the following resolutions: (1) Unanimously support Consul-General Chen Xintang. (2) Consul-General Chen has handled overseas Chinese affairs for many years with integrity and selflessness, and his meritorious service is evident and admired by our overseas Chinese community. Request the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador to submit a detailed report to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting appropriate recognition. (3) Consul-General Chen is currently being unjustly accused under the guise of the Nationalist Party branch. We should defend him based on the facts. (4) Regarding the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador's clarification document, sent to Mr. Wu Kewei, Secretary of the Embassy in Peru, on May 11, 19, to clarify the thirteen accusations against Consul-General Chen by the Chinese Nationalist Party branch in Guayaquil, requesting him to forward it to Mr. Wei, the Acting Envoy in Peru, who will then forward it to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we unanimously believe that it reflects the public's opinion and should be recorded, reported, and announced. (5) Regarding the declaration signed by Chen Gunting, Zhang Maokang, and others at the public banquet for Mr. Wu Kewei and Fan Bingrong held by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Guayaquil on May 10, 19, we unanimously express our sympathy and should immediately record, report, and announce it. (6) Regarding the express telegram sent by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government on February 12, 18, we unanimously recognize it as the collective will of the whole and should immediately record, report, and announce it. (7) Mr. Chen Xintang has served as the Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador for over ten years and has been serving as the Honorary Consul-General in Ecuador for six years. He has been clean and devoted to public service and has effectively protected the overseas Chinese community. If he were to harbor any intention of resigning due to this injustice, the lives and properties of our overseas Chinese in this country without a treaty would be even more precarious. We request the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to carefully consider the matter and avoid causing concern to the overseas Chinese community. (8) The current executive committee members and party members of the Chinese Nationalist Party branch in Guayaquil mostly do not follow the correct path. Instead of promoting and guiding the overseas Chinese community with party principles and cooperation, they arbitrarily slander the good under the guise of the branch. They repeatedly provoke our overseas Chinese community internally, destroying unity, and externally, they fabricate and spread rumors, concealing the truth from their superiors. Such behavior is deeply resented by the overseas Chinese community and is intolerable to party principles and morality. Not only have repeated requests for new party members been unsuccessful, but existing party members are also gradually withdrawing. We request the Central Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party to issue a warning to the executive committee members and party members of the branch and instruct them to follow the correct path in the future and refrain from engaging in meaningless actions. (9) Consul Chen and our overseas Chinese compatriots in Ecuador have always believed in Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and have always wanted to join the Nationalist Party and work together. However, due to the actions of the Guayaquil branch being mostly contrary to party discipline and not following the correct path, it has been impossible to develop. We request the Central Committee of the Chinese Nationalist Party to pay attention to guiding this point. All of the above resolutions have been telegraphed and mailed by the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Ecuador to the Central Standing Committee, Organization Department, Propaganda Department, Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Chairman Jiang of the National Government, the Premier of the Executive Yuan, the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Acting Envoy Wei in Peru, and the Executive Supervisory Committee of the Lima Direct Branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party for their information.</p>

<p>Important Educational News</p>
<h3>The Su Education Department Determines the Fee Payment Method for Provincial Middle School Students</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Will Establish a Phonetic Symbol Training Class</h3>
<p>In order to actively promote phonetic symbols, the Ministry of Education will hold a phonetic symbol training class in the Central University classroom starting from the 28th of this month. National language experts will be hired as instructors to teach phonetic symbols (the curriculum includes an introduction to phonetic symbols and principles, pronunciation methods, tone exercises, phonetic spelling, and phonetic exercises). The class will be held twice a week for two months, two hours each time. After the training plan is determined, the Ministry of Education will send letters to the party and government agencies in the capital, asking them to send staff members to participate in the learning. After completing the training, they will return to their original agencies to promote and popularize the learning. It is heard that the method of sending staff members from each agency is to send one person for every fifty people. The number of training classes depends on the number of students, but it is estimated that it will not exceed six classes, with no more than fifty people per class.</p>
<h3>Second Session of Teacher Training in Jiangsu Counties</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Province Counties Joint Office for the Preparation of Compulsory Education sent a letter to the Education Bureaus of Jiangsu Province regarding the request to designate teachers to participate in the second session of correspondence teacher training. The letter stated: "Our office's first session of correspondence teacher training has already obtained the consent of the education bureaus of various counties. We have enclosed the regulations and requested that you widely inform unqualified teachers to register and enroll within a specified period. Currently, the number of students from various counties is quite high. However, it has been observed that most teachers register directly with the bureau themselves. We are deeply concerned that the participants may not be comprehensive, and whether priority should be given to training is difficult to determine. It has been clearly ordered that the education bureaus should investigate and identify teachers whose abilities are inadequate through county supervisors and education committees, and designate them for remedial studies. Recently, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education, in order to supplement the abilities of teachers in various counties, has also ordered, based on the original order of the former University Council, that the education bureaus of various counties should promptly organize workshops during the summer vacation. The curriculum of our training department is fundamentally targeted at rural areas, paying close attention to the application of educational methods. Emerging subjects such as party ideology and phonetic symbols are incorporated separately. It is more detailed than the subjects of training classes or workshops. We are sending another letter requesting that your bureau, in addition to those teachers who report themselves to participate, please also use the designation method to compile a list of names and order them to participate. We are enclosing a projected table of trainees participating from various counties. We hope you will estimate the number of people in your county who plan to participate in the training and send the training fee payment method. Any changes that need to be made in the future can be changed at any time." Accordingly, a letter is sent for your reference and reply.</p>

<h3>Situation of Administrative Inspection of Elementary Schools in Nanjing City</h3>
<p>Since the first semester of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Education Bureau of Nanjing City has stipulated a minimum provisional administrative standard for elementary schools. All administrative facilities in city schools must be carried out in accordance with the standards. Before the end of the semester, supervisors and instructors will use the items listed in the administrative standards to create examination forms, schedule itineraries, and go to various schools for inspection as the final assessment of school performance at the end of the semester. As for regular inspections of teaching conditions, guidance research meetings, and temporary special inspections, a departmental guidance system is adopted, with special personnel responsible for each. After the elementary school administrative standards were revised this semester, the elementary school administrative inspection item was also changed to three inspections in the second, regular, and fifth months. All items stipulated in the administrative standards, such as the creation of administrative plans, administrative calendars, school building allocation, curriculum arrangement, holiday assignments, children's activity organization, and research organization, which must be completed within one month before or after the start of school, will be inspected in the second month. As for the distribution of teachers' and staff's tasks, student registration, student attendance, student homework, economic audit and management, health facilities, disease handling, epidemic prevention, library equipment, teaching aids, the implementation of various subjects' teaching processes, textbook reservation, moral education facilities and methods, children's activity work, morning meetings, morning exercises, research work, and classroom layout, all kinds of forms and books are inspected irregularly. In addition, the items inspected in the fifth month, such as various gatherings, assessments, various statistics, types and quantities of charts, student homework results and correction methods, the number of academic examinations and methods, and extracurricular teaching results, student academic reports, physical examinations, physical education records, and the number and records of various forms and books, are numerous. Since these results are usually scattered throughout the school and with the students and cannot be collected immediately, scheduled dates are set so that the schools can collect and display them in one place in advance, which will greatly reduce the difficulty of inspection and save time. Therefore, in addition to the second-month inspection and regular inspections, the schools will not be notified of the inspection dates this semester. In order to avoid the difficulty of collection and save time in the fifth-month inspection, the inspection schedule will still be notified to the schools in advance. In addition, the last inspection of this semester coincided with the temporary inspection by the City Party Department, such as the moral education facilities in primary and secondary schools, the graduation supervision of middle schools, the entrance examination, and the physical examination. The work of each instructor was tense and insufficient. Therefore, the last administrative examination was only conducted by two supervisors who were responsible for inspecting various schools. This is the general situation of the administrative inspection of primary schools in Kyoto this year. The results of the assessment of the facilities and achievements of the schools this semester are disclosed as follows: There are six schools that can maintain their original excellent achievements and work harder; seven schools that have made progress in all aspects of administration and work harder; five schools that have made progress in administration; four schools that can maintain their original achievements in administration; two schools that meet the administrative standards; four schools that generally meet the administrative standards but need to pay close attention to improvement; and one school that has no administrative method and needs to be reorganized urgently.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Education Organizes Correspondence Research Department for Teacher Training</h3>
<p>Gospel for the creation of elementary school teachers</p>
<p>Handled in two phases starting in the afternoon</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education believes that there is a shortage of elementary school teachers in the province, and that current elementary school teachers lack opportunities for further education. Summer workshops held in various places are temporary, and the most appropriate and effective way to provide continuous further education throughout the year is through correspondence research in addition to self-study. It is reported that starting in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, it is planned to establish a Correspondence Research Department for Teacher Training in Zhejiang Province within the department, to be handled in three phases. After its establishment, its impact and effectiveness will be significant. The methods are recorded below: (1) The Correspondence Research Department for Teacher Training aims to improve the academic ability of elementary school teachers throughout the province. (2) The Correspondence Research Department for Teacher Training enrolls elementary school teachers from various counties and cities as students. (3) Elementary school teachers in various counties and cities who volunteer to become students should fill out a volunteer form and a resume form before the start of each semester and report directly to the research department.

Those who pass the exam will then study the second phase. Those who pass the second phase exam will study the third phase. Those who complete the three phases and pass the exam administered by the research department will be given a certificate. Students who obtain this certificate have the same qualifications as those who have attended three vacation workshops and are exempt from the oral examination when registering as an elementary school teacher, but those who fail the assessment must repeat the course. (6) Students must submit a reading report every two months during the study period (report form attached separately). If there are any questions in the book, they may fill out a form (form attached separately) and send it to the research department for a reply. However, if necessary, the research department may also raise research questions and ask students to reply. (7) The quota for students is tentatively set at 1,000.

<h3>Chunhui Middle School Continues to Operate</h3>
<p>Provincial authorities send troops to the school for protection</p>
<p>The board of directors decided to continue operating</p>
<p>After the abduction of the principal, teachers, and students of Chunhui Middle School in Zhejiang Province, the board of directors decided to announce the suspension of operations because "the protectors were unable to defend themselves." However, the students of the school believed that such actions were a case of throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Therefore, on June 19, they established a school protection movement committee to distribute declarations to schools, organizations, and institutions across the country, requesting assistance from all sectors and going to the province to request that letters be sent to the board of directors to find ways to continue protecting them. After struggling through hardships, it is now almost a month and the great task has been accomplished. Regarding the security issue, the province has sent troops to be stationed at the school on a regular basis to protect it. Regarding the continuation of operations, the board of directors also decided at the meeting on July 10 at Chunshe that "the next semester will continue to operate, and Mr. Huang Shuzi will be hired as the principal." He will come to take office in the near future. Therefore, the school protection movement committee announced its end on the 12th, and in addition to sending letters to notify students, it also announced to all sectors in the newspaper and declared its end. It is also reported that the committee plans to hold a large-scale Chunhui revival celebration when school starts next semester in this resurrected voice, and widely invites students with artistic talents to come to the school early to prepare, in order to comfort the danger of Teachers Fan and Wu. It is said that they have already sent letters to invite them.</p>

<p>Davis Cup Doubles Final</p>
<h3>Japan Suffers Miserable Defeat to Italy</h3>
<p>Japan Loses to Italy in Davis Cup Match</p>
<p>The Telecommunications News Agency reported from Geneva on the 11th that in the Davis Cup European Group final match between Japan and Italy, Japan lost with one win and one loss yesterday. Both sides were very interested in today's doubles, and Japan finally lost 3-2. Although there are still two singles matches, it will be difficult for Japanese players Harada and Ota to reverse the decline without vigorous efforts. The results of today's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Demolipei Jinsiguli 8-6 9-7 6-8 2-6 6-1 Abei Harada Japan</p>
<p>Harada, who was expected by everyone this day, was weak from the beginning, unlike yesterday, which disappointed the viewers. The third set showed some improvement and became 2-2, but in the end, the Japanese side was exhausted and physically unable to cope, and it became increasingly difficult. Experts criticized that if the Japanese side could have made a little effort to win the second set when it had a 4-1 lead, the Japanese side might have won today's match.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter by Haike</h3>
<p>Regimental Commander: Battalion Commander, what does your father do?</p>
<p>Battalion Commander: My father has one hundred mu of land for farming, for a living.</p>
<p>Regimental Commander: What a pity, why didn't you learn from him and become a farmer too?</p>
<p>Battalion Commander: May I ask, Regimental Commander, what did your grandfather do?</p>
<p>Regimental Commander: He was a learned and sensible gentleman.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander: What a pity, Regimental Commander, why didn't you learn from him and become a learned and sensible gentleman?</p>
<p>A: I have a strange idea. What if a saint and a demon went to court and sued each other? Who do you think would win?</p>
<p>B: I think the saint would definitely lose because the lawyers are all on the demon's side.</p>
<p>Father: Son, you're so grown up now, you should get a wife.</p>
<p>Son: Father, I really want to get married, but the world is so big, whose wife should I marry?</p>
<p>Gigolo: Darling, why don't you give me that diamond ring on your finger? So that I can always remember you, and our love will be as continuous as this diamond ring.</p>
<p>Flirtatious Woman: Very well. But why don't you give me that gold watch of yours first? So that I can always remember you and hope that our future will be as complete as this gold watch.</p>
<h3>Shanghai University Boy Scouts' Trip to Japan by Zhang Minguang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai University Boy Scouts of Yangshupu are well-trained and have excellent achievements. This time, they were invited and sponsored by various groups in Japan to take advantage of the summer vacation to visit Japan for a month and tour scenic spots such as Kobe, Osaka, Nara, Yokohama, Kyoto, Tokyo, and Nikko. The ninth of the month is the date for the group's trip to the East. Because my younger brother Shuliang and close friends Mr. Huang Zhihua and Mr. Wu Erchang are all in the military, I specially accompanied my parents and elder brother Yuli to see them off. I will write down the grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>On that day, the breeze was gentle and the morning light was bright, as if hinting at the joy of the send-off. At approximately 7:45 AM, our car arrived at the Huishan Wharf. Later, because the Nagasaki Maru was docked at the Huangpu Wharf, we turned around and went there. When we arrived, the well-wishers were already holding fruits, firecrackers, and colorful ribbons, gathering by the river, waiting for their brothers, sons, and children to arrive. Suddenly, the music was loud and the national flag was flying. The Shanghai University Boy Scouts, who were eagerly awaited by the crowd, marched out of the crowd in formation. Their military appearance was solemn, and the team was orderly. Although the uniforms were ordinary, the shoulder straps were fastened with the words "Zhonghua" (中華), which was quite representative of the color of the Boy Scouts of all China, so they were highly noticed by the well-wishers. The Boy Scouts marched to the side of the ship and stood in formation (at attention). At this time, many family members looked for their children in the team. The Boy Scouts greeted acquaintances with smiles, as if they were infinitely happy.</p>
<p>It was heard that among those who came to see them off were Commander Zeng Yiding of the Wusong Fort Torpedo Fleet and several of his family members, who presented the Boy Scouts with a yellow flag with the inscription "Xiang Qi Wu Qiong" (相期無窮, "Hoping for Infinity"). Dr. Hu Shih also came to the scene to see them off, because his beloved son was also in the army. Mr. Hu's youngest son was at the end of the line. He was handsome, lively, and lovable. Mr. Hu wore spectacles, a summer cloth long gown, a straw hat, and cloth shoes, appearing and disappearing in the crowd, and said to his friend in English, "My son is the youngest and at the very end..." When he spoke, he smiled, and his satisfaction was obvious. At nine o'clock, the Nagasaki Maru set sail on time. Those who sent them off with colorful ribbons each held one end with others to show their reluctance, and those who did not have this item ran around to buy it. Although the price was high, they did not hesitate. It was appropriate for the vendors who made this speculative business to benefit three times, and there was a general shortage of supply. As the colorful ribbons flew in the air, the sound of firecrackers also followed on the shore, coupled with the Boy Scouts' majestic cheers and inspiring military songs, which was enough to strengthen the journey and comfort the hearts of the senders. The Boy Scouts brought silk and bamboo instruments with them on this trip to Japan for performances, which was a particularly innovative move. It was heard that they planned to take the world's largest and fastest Japanese mail ship, the Chichibu Maru, when they returned home.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Western Suits by Zheng Yimei</h3>
<p>Western suits are now widely popular around the world. Among the Chinese people, those who wear Western suits account for almost two or three out of ten. Their convenience and fit are indeed much better than wide robes and large sleeves. Moreover, there is a risk of robbery at night at sea, but those who wear Western suits are fortunate to be exempt, because Western suits are not easy to pawn, and robbers do not like to patronize them.</p>
<p>Recently, the trouser legs of Western suits have been enlarged in imitation of the American style. According to a gentleman who returned from the New World, when the Prince of England visited the United States the year before last, the American people held a meeting to welcome him. Unexpectedly, as the ship was approaching the port, the Prince's trousers suddenly tore. However, he was in a hurry to leave and did not bring an extra set to change into. While he was hesitating, a sailor offered his new trousers. The Prince did not have time to choose and rashly put them on. When the American people saw them at the meeting, they were extremely envious, saying that the trousers style was generous and very elegant, so they imitated them one after another, and the big-legged trousers suddenly became popular in society.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities have penalty regulations for Western suits with unbuttoned trouser flies. Each button is fined five gold coins, which is said to be related to public morals. It is heard that the French Concession in Shanghai also has plans to imitate this, but it is not known for sure.</p>
<p>The materials for Western suits are mostly imported goods. In this era of high prices, they are extraordinarily expensive. It is best to use domestic goods to plug the leak. My friend Xu Hesheng, a famous educator, recently met and chatted with me. I saw that Mr. Xu was wearing a summer Western suit made of duoluo ramie, which was refreshing, simple, and elegant. Duoluo ramie is produced in Jiangxi Province. Its material is strong and its color is slightly yellow, so it is a good product. According to Mr. Xu, Mr. Tang Shaochuan once wore a Western suit made of duoluo ramie to a meeting. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also wore a Zhongshan suit made of duoluo ramie to supervise the battle. I am just following in the footsteps of great men and do not dare to claim the credit for innovation.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk Away From Home by Liu Huo'an</h3>
<p>I bid farewell to Suzhou, where I was sick, and Wuxi remained the same. Therefore, my reluctance to part was almost competing with the 36,000 hectares of misty waves.</p>
<p>I wrote a poem to say goodbye to my colleagues at the Wuxi News, saying, "Green waves and red apricots, beautiful scenery, only arouse the sorrow of parting. Cherish each other, say goodbye, and fly away on horseback. From now on, my soul will be attached to the jasper mountains." My feelings are in it.</p>
<p>I visited the Boxian Park in Zhenjiang, remembering that I used to visit this newspaper with Boxian. I hastily wrote a couplet, saying, "The spirit of flowers and plants is just right to share happiness with the people; the feelings of wind and clouds, how can I bear to look at the scenery and miss the people." This couplet is just to express my feelings.</p>
<h3>The Number of Inventions in Various Countries by Tao</h3>
<p>A Swedish newspaper published an interesting index table. According to statistics from American experts, the number of inventions by people in each country is calculated according to the proportion of the population. The result is that Switzerland ranks first, with an index of 930. Sweden ranks second with 299, and Germany ranks third with 271. The rest are in order: Denmark 236, Norway 229, France 195, England 188, Belgium 180, Australia and the United States each 140, Czechoslovakia 108, Hungary 68, Italy 42, Finland 40, India and Russia are the lowest, only one-half and nine-tenths. The end of the table also includes a statement that although Soviet Russia is unfortunately behind in material inventions, in recent years its new inventions in political and social aspects are endless, but unfortunately they have not been able to give the world practical benefits.</p>
<h3>Impressions of a Trip to the East (6)</h3>
<p>(6) A Glimpse of Kobe</p>
<p>It takes sixteen hours by train from Nagasaki to Kobe, but it takes twenty hours by boat. However, taking the train to Moji requires crossing the river by ferry, which is slightly troublesome for travelers. However, sailing on the Japanese Inland Sea with its many small islands, green mountains, and green waters not only has the advantage of beautiful scenery but also has no suffering from wind and waves. Therefore, those who go to Japan from Shanghai prefer to go directly to Kobe. The Shanghai Maru left Nagasaki at 5:00 PM on the 14th. There was a dance party on the boat that night. The passengers sang and danced happily like family members. They only went to bed at 11:00 PM. They got up at dawn the next morning. At 8:00 AM, the boat passed the Kurushima Strait, with Nakato Island on the left and Uma Island on the right, which are also famous scenic spots in Japan. Passengers gathered on the deck and held binoculars to look at the many passing ships, all of which belonged to the Japanese mail ship company. They often sounded their horns and lowered their flags to pay their respects. At 11:00 AM, they arrived in Kobe. Passengers were notified in advance that foreigners entering the country should first inspect their passports before they could land. Although Chinese people do not need passports, they still have to undergo a final interrogation by the police, which took a full hour to complete. Zeng Yanhua, a reporter from this newspaper stationed in Kobe, came to pick them up. After getting off the boat together, they went to the customs for luggage inspection. Japanese customs are very strict in punishing private smuggling of tobacco and alcohol. Passengers are given a luggage declaration form in advance to fill out for customs declaration. First-class passengers are allowed to carry up to one hundred cigarettes. Those who exceed this limit will have them confiscated and fined. The inspection office is about a hundred paces away from the dock. The customs officials are extremely strict in their inspection, overturning boxes and checking even a piece of paper in detail, especially for Chinese people. After the inspection is completed, they stamp and release them. At the corner, they have to undergo another re-examination, so it is very difficult to carry prohibited items and evade taxes. Kobe City is one of Japan's important ports. All routes passing through Japan stop at Kobe. Therefore, commerce is prosperous and banks are lined up. The streets are very clean and the roads are wide, resembling Tianjin in our country. In addition to streetcars and rickshaws, transportation is convenient by automobile. One can hire one along the way. The fare for each ride, regardless of distance, is one yen. Rickshaws are also very common. The usual fare is about half a yen per day. The speed is slow and the time is too uneconomical. They will definitely be eliminated in the future. Most of the Chinese in Kobe are engaged in banking and hold a part of the economic power. This time, the Kobe Overseas Chinese also donated more than 5,000 gold coins for the expenses of our country's athletes going to Japan for the Far Eastern Games. Their enthusiasm for the motherland is evident. The Cantonese account for the most power among the overseas Chinese and are particularly enthusiastic about sports. There is an organization called the Kobe Overseas Chinese Basketball Team, which is well-known locally and has attended the National Games, winning a lot of praise. Most of the team members are from the Kobe University of Commerce and have an excellent foundation in basketball tactics. They once fought against the strongest Waseda University basketball team in Japan. Although they were defeated, the scores were still close. If they can improve their skills and practice continuously, they will definitely become a strong team in the future. The reporter hurriedly toured the city for a week and then took a car to Osaka with Mr. Zeng at 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>I, Yu Tiansong, am a close friend of him. Zeng once drafted a couplet for the Minhang Huami Office, saying, "The world wishes to preserve the ambition of clothing and bedding; what is the purpose of life for rice and grain?" I was shocked and appalled by a nightmare for many years. Therefore, I offered a couplet, saying, "It is difficult to find someone in the world who can take over Li Rangmei. I am shocked by the change in the world. How can I bear to cry for this person?" Heaven has a spirit. When will I look back at the confidant in the world?</p>
<p>I revisited the ancient name of Twelve Forts, Luanjiang, and was inspired to write a poem, saying, "I have come and gone to Luanjiang several times in the past thirty years. I am ashamed of my lack of talent. I have put my heart and soul into making wedding dresses for others and it is difficult to be in harmony with the world, causing trouble. I also have sincerity to repay the party and the country and I have only the integrity to be proud of the plum blossoms. I am optimistic and still look forward to the future and the only comfort is a glass of wine. Fallen in the world, how can I ask where I will die? (Qu Que)."</p>
<h3>Trivial Talk on Ice Cocoons by Ms. Chen Huiling</h3>
<p>The ice cocoon is another name for lychee. It is a specialty of Fujian and Guangdong. It is advisable to pick and eat it immediately. The skin is bright red and the flesh is as crystal clear as crystal, slightly crisp. The juice is sweet and fragrant, leaving a lingering taste. The lychees sold in Shanghai have been transported for several days, and the skin is brown, the flesh has changed, and the taste is greatly reduced. It has already lost the true style of the Eighteen Niang.</p>
<p>My mother's home in Dongguan has a Nan Garden, which covers hundreds of acres and has more than a hundred lychee trees planted in it. In summer, the fruits are ripe, and they are all red, with thousands of red pills and round canopies. When I was young, I often invited my classmates to climb to the top of the tree and pick and eat them. The nectar was chewed and the teeth and cheeks were cool. I still regard it as an elegant thing. In recent years, I have been driven by food and clothing to live in Shenpu with Zhuo'an. Every time I hear the cicadas chirping on the trees (in Cantonese dialect, "when the autumn cicadas cry, the lychees are ripe"), I look at my home garden from afar and am always fascinated.</p>
<p>The most taboo thing when lychees are in bloom and the fruits are not yet ripe is for people to pick them. Otherwise, the birds will gather and peck at the flowers and young fruits until they are exhausted. The gardener in my lychee garden is strictly patrolling at this time, and no one except the owner is allowed to cross the line.</p>
<p>Lychee lotus duck is a good dish for the hot weather in Guangdong. The method of making it in my home is to slaughter the duck, wash it clean, season it with oil and salt, add water, and use fresh lychees without skin and pits. Place it under the duck and cover it with fresh lotus leaves and steam it for about two hours. Take it out and eat it. It is fragrant and delicious. Most Cantonese restaurants in the city have this dish. Although the method of making it is slightly different, it is generally the same. Foodies can always tell the flavor of this dish.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (2) (3) (2) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 12: Farewell Banquet and Leaving Wine, Holding Flowers to Leave a Beautiful Shadow; Famous Garden Gathering, Tea Competition to See Elegant Postures</p>
<p>That Mr. Shi Guanping, he was also assigned to sell two hundred seed welfare tickets, which is almost an acknowledgment of two hundred dollars. When he returned to the newspaper office, he draped a cloth long gown that was as wrinkled as bean curd skin over his arm and wore a thin ge short shirt, which was similar to the long-collared short shirt worn by monks. He was waving a round fan, but it was someone else's style. It turned out that people admired his calligraphy and asked him to write it. After he finished writing, he did not return it to others. These two days, he was using the fan and took it in his hand to fan himself. When he met the owner of the fan, he returned it to him. He ran to the chief editor's office while fanning himself and shouted, "Do you want seed welfare tickets? One dollar each, ten dollars for ten. The grand prize is a pearl necklace with a flower basket, worth three thousand yuan. There are other things worth five thousand yuan in total. Buy them if you want, don't miss them." Several editors in the chief editor's office laughed and said, "Mr. Shi, are you running a newspaper and doing lottery ticket business?" Shi Guanping said, "They assigned me two hundred tickets and told me to sell them. Everyone, please help. The lottery will be drawn in public tomorrow, which is reliable. It's not like those slippery lottery tickets where the grand prize is always drawn in their own home." Several editors then bought three tickets each. Zuo Shichen said, "Take five too." Shi Guanping said, "Take ten tickets, just like donating ten dollars and it's over." At the same time, Ji Lanxin came over and Shi Guanping also asked him to sell ten tickets. He then went to a club on the top floor of the Ping Newspaper and met Long Ziyun and said, "Mr. Long, plant more blessings and sell more seed welfare tickets. Do you want twenty tickets?" Long Ziyun also took ten tickets. It turned out that Long Ziyun often came here. He was a mathematician and several of his brothers were engaged in business in Shanghai. He was also well-known in both the academic and business circles. Every night, when he returned from his gold shop, he always made a turn at the Ping Newspaper and sat on the top floor to listen to the news. News and business are closely related, especially the gold business. That day, he took off his white official gauze long gown. Inside was a narrow-sleeved undershirt. Outside the undershirt, he wore a green official gauze vest. There were a total of four pockets on the vest, two large pockets and two small pockets. Ordinary vests always have three pockets, and the pockets are homophones with the character for generation, so people call it "three generations of ancestors." This Mr. Long had one more generation. All kinds of things were complete in his pockets: bank drafts, safe deposit box numbers, exchanges, post offices, all were in his pockets. At this time, Long Ziyun said to Zuo Shichen, "My family went to Zhang's Garden yesterday. They said it was very lively. I haven't been there yet. Shall we go together today?" Zuo Shichen said, "I wanted to go and see that grand event, which is also material for the news." Long Ziyun said, "Okay, then I'll ask the waiter to call a carriage. The road is too far and it's not convenient to charter a car because it's too crowded."</p>

<h3>Commercial News</h3>
<p>Financial New Currency Sells Surprisingly Well in Guangdong, Lixa Continues to Rise. Yesterday, as usual on Sundays, the market atmosphere was quiet. Only the new currency in Guangdong sold surprisingly well, resulting in a lively situation. As a result, the lixa price rose again. The morning market was 7 qian 2 fen 7 lixa, and the afternoon market was 7 qian 2 fen 7 li 2 hao. Transactions were made: 485,000 for remittances in the morning market and 355,000 in the afternoon market. Banknotes were 35,000 in the morning market and 75,000 in the afternoon market. New currency was 100,000 in the morning market and 45,000 in the afternoon market. Off-site banknotes were 165,000 in the morning market and 160,000 in the afternoon market. Banks were closed for business, with no market. Silver dismantling was 1 qian in the morning market and 1 qian 1 fen in the afternoon market. Money shops collected and remitted over 2.4 million in foreign silver and over 29 million in domestic silver. There was no news about bank collections and remittances. Small money shops traded over 400,000 banknotes. The exchange rate for small silver in Jiangnan was 6 qian 3 fen in both the morning and afternoon markets. Transactions were made: 1,000 jiao in the morning market and 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Small silver in Guangdong was 6 qian 1 fen and a half li in the morning market and 6 qian 1 fen 2 li and a half in the afternoon market. Transactions were made: 170,000 jiao in the morning market and 130,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The copper coin exchange rate increased from 2,000 to 386,000 wen.</p>
<h3>Special Circumstances of the Premium and Discount of Banknotes and Silver Dollars</h3>
<p>In recent days, because the Guangdong banks were selling surprisingly well, the lixa price was bound to rise. At the same time, the difference between the discount on banknotes and the premium on new currency was very large. With the same common currency system, the increase and decrease often had different meanings. For example, yesterday, banknotes had to be discounted 2 hao 5 or 3 hao 7 and a half, and even 4.375, which was not far from half a li, while the premium on new currency (that is, silver dollars. Currently, there are only two types of silver dollars: Zhongshan and Yuan heads. Recently, the premium on Yuan coins has been even higher, so there is no longer a silver dollar denomination) was at least 2 hao 2 li and a half, and at most 2 li and a half. Based on yesterday morning's lixa price, banknotes were only 7 qian 2 fen 7 lixa, while new currency had to be 7 qian 3 fen. Pure new currency was always 7 qian 3 fen 3 lixa, and Yuan coins required 7 qian 3 fen 3 or 4 lixa. If this continues, banknotes will lose their inherent position and, over time, it will become a habit that banknotes and silver dollars will have to have two different quotations. It was found that yesterday, the Guangdong shipping company shipped over one million new Yuan coins and silver dollars, and the supply continued to be abundant.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations in the Gold Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Frequent Declines and Weekend Rebound: Gold Market Fluctuations Remained Strong Last Week, But the Underlying Downward Trend Was Persistent. Daily Ups and Downs Were Common, with Fluctuations Exceeding Ten Taels. The Price Hovered Around 600 Taels, Creating Confusion and Uncertainty in the Market. Externally, the Exchange Rate Appeared to Ease Slightly, but the Listed Rate Remained Unchanged for Several Days. Later, a Slight Increase Was Observed. Chinese Speculators Largely Sold Off Their Holdings, While Banks Maintained Strong Appetite. Overseas Silver Markets Also Showed Signs of Rising. At the Beginning of the Week, the Gold Price Once Surged to 616 Taels, Allegedly Due to Rumors of Bankers Transporting Cash for Export, Which Boosted Market Sentiment. However, the Situation Remained Unpredictable. The Closing Price Ultimately Ended Lower, Marking the Fifth Consecutive Day of Decline. On Friday Morning, the Silver Market and Exchange Rate Rose Sharply, Causing the Price to Plunge to 588 Taels. However, High Gold Prices Were Discovered Over the Weekend, Leading to a Surge Back Above the 600 Taels Mark. Major Players Actively Bought, But No One Absorbed the Spot Goods, Resulting in a Bid Price Increase of 14 Taels. There Is Still Potential for Further Price Increases. Over These Six Days, the Bid Price Fluctuated by a Total of 28 Taels, Making the Market Situation Unpredictable. The Final Price Settled Between 602 Taels, a Decrease of 5.8 Taels Compared to the Previous Saturday. The Opening Price Was Approximately 60 Taels Lower, with the Lowest Price Only Around 50 Taels Lower. Subsequently, the Price Decreased by 51-52 Taels. A Detailed Account of the Six Days from July 7th (Monday) to July 12th (Saturday) Is Provided Below.</p>
<p>Observing the Process Reveals an Underlying Weakness: At the Beginning of the Week (July 7th), Large Silver Bars Retraced, but the Internal Exchange Rate Was Initially Strong Before Weakening. The Initial Bid Price for August Was 605 Taels, After Which Major Players Competed to Buy, and the Cash Trend Strengthened, Rising to 616 Taels. However, by the Closing, It Had Retraced to 606.8 Taels. Tianyu, Yongyi, Feng, Yongfu, Xing, Yongyuan, Mao, and Yongheng Xing Tend to Sell. However, the Circumstances Were Turbulent, with Fluctuations of 14 Taels. The Silver Market Rebounded the Next Day, and Internal Markets, Including Xianling, Also Experienced Loosening. Therefore, the Opening Saw Weakness, Then Breached the 600 Taels Mark, But Later Re-exited. However, the Closing Was Over Three Taels Lower Than the Previous Day. The Market Seemed Peaceful on Wednesday, with Fluctuations Limited to Six Taels, Hovering Around the 602-3 Taels Range for the Longest Time. However, After 11 O'Clock, Due to Competing Sales from Yongfeng, Hengxing, Taikang, Run, and Others, the Price Retreating Within the Boundary. Later, Buying Emerged, Causing the Closing to Reach 603 Taels. The Silver Market Rose the Following Day, and the Exchange Rate Increased by Half a Grade, Remaining Unchanged for About Ten Days. Suddenly, the Exchange Rate Lengthened to Become the Internal Market, Presumably Due to Shortages. Therefore, the Gold Price Broke Through the 600 Taels Mark at the Opening. In the Afternoon, the Price Plunged to 591 Taels. Major Players Hastily Sold Off, But Someone Replenished, Adding Slightly to Two Taels. The Ups and Downs Were over Eleven Taels That Day. On Friday, Large Silver Bars Continued to Rise, and Xianling Increased by Another Half a Grade, Reaching One Shilling and Six Pence. However, the Internal Market Remained Stable. Some Sales Occurred During Trading. As for the Bid Price, It Was Weak at the Opening and Then Suddenly Plummeted to 588 Taels. Later, the Buying Actively Gained Momentum, Rising Very Rapidly, Ultimately Reaching over 92 Taels, But Still Over One Tael Lower Than the Previous Day, Marking Five Consecutive Days of Decline. On Saturday (July 12th), the Silver Market Rose Slightly, and the Exchange Rate Stabilized, Boosting Market Sentiment. With Spot Goods Soaring, the Market Situation Presented a Sharp Outlook. However, the Initial Decline Was Over Two Taels. Subsequently, Major Players Such as Fuchang, Xiangyu, Zhifeng, Yongyu, Dafu, Xingyong, and Others Continued to Buy, and Around Noon, There Was a Sense of Daily Ascendancy, Surging Above 600 Taels, Reaching 601.7 Taels. The Closing Ultimately Retraced a High of Over Nine Taels, Which Was a Reversal After Multiple Days of Decline. Compared to the Previous Saturday (July 5th), It Was Down 5.8 Taels.

<h3>Review of the Cotton Yarn Market Over the Past Week</h3>
<p>Spot Sales…Guangdong and Sichuan Demand Strong</p>
<p>Bidding…Near Higher, Distant Flat</p>
<p>Actual Sales of Cotton Yarn: Guangdong merchants were very active in procurement at the beginning of the week, absorbing more than 10,000 bales in one day. There were many optimistic speculators, and the situation seemed quite promising. The price increases were mainly for coarse yarn, with some manufacturers already selling out their October shipments, indicating the strong interest of Guangdong merchants. Therefore, the market had a slight upward trend. However, other merchants remained inactive, and business remained sluggish. It was found that half of the purchases by Guangdong merchants were speculative, and the world cotton industry was still in decline. American and Indian cotton prices were very low, and low-grade yarns were seeking outlets. Therefore, Nisshin Yoko offered very low prices in the market, and various factories had sufficient spot yarn supply. The main reason why the market did not experience a significant increase was the pressure from the world cotton market. If the prices of Japanese yarn were slightly higher, large quantities would arrive. Moreover, the price of 20-count yarn was only 164-5 taels, which was more than ten taels lower than Japanese yarn in Shanghai. The shipping cost of Japanese yarn to Shanghai was 21.5 taels per bale, indicating the weakness of the Japanese yarn market. It is said that there are approximately 400,000 pieces of yarn in stock in Japan. In summary, the political unrest in India continues, and it is difficult to expect low-grade yarns to rise. Standard yarn in this city, due to the firm attitude of a certain factory and its reluctance to release supply, and Dafeng, which delivers goods every month, has tended to increase. Recently, Guangdong merchants have purchased a large quantity of coarse yarn, and the period is currently booming. There is a shortage of those selling near-month contracts, so the market price is higher. However, there are many short-sellers of distant-month contracts due to various unfavorable conditions, resulting in a situation of near higher, distant lower. In summary, based on the world situation, there is certainly no good outlook. However, there is a lack of sellers in the market, and the current period is still in the sales boom. Therefore, despite the unfavorable environment, everyone is temporarily taking a wait-and-see attitude. The total turnover for the week was 82,450 bales. The bidding yarn rose at the beginning of the week, and market sentiment was boosted due to the demand for spot yarn from Guangdong. Distant months also saw 7 taels 12 qian. Before long, due to the unfavorable overseas cotton market, it turned downward. As a result, the current month rose by 8 qian, and the distant month remained flat. Merchant customers were mainly from Guangdong and Sichuan. Other scattered purchases for the entire week totaled 25,005 bales. Among the traders, 2,665 bales were imported. The price of Japanese yarn rose by 1 tael, and the price of domestic yarn rose by about 1 tael. The number of bales purchased by each merchant group is listed below:</p>
<p>Merchant Group　Bales　Merchant Group　Bales　Merchant Group　Bales　Merchant Group　Bales</p>
<p>Guangdong 19180　Hankou 315　Sichuan Fine 100　Xuzhou 200</p>
<p>Wuhu 160　Zhenjiang 100　Shantou 110　Nanyang 400</p>

<h3>Cotton Market Conditions Over the Past Week</h3>
<p>Hankou Standard…Overall Trend Does Not Escape Hovering</p>
<p>Factory Appetite…Absorbing a Lot of Indian Cotton</p>
<p>The cotton market remains strong, but the situation of Indian and American cotton overseas is extremely weakening, with no vitality. Old cotton is not showing much movement because consumption is too low and the weather for new cotton is good. The stock of base goods in this city is thinner than last year, and Hankou merchants have slightly higher intentions, but Japanese merchants are offering Indian cotton at very accommodating prices, which are very low. Factories are of course not required to purchase local cotton and trading has stalled. The market atmosphere is depressed and New cotton is hovering in the five tael pass. With the US cotton market issuing the decrease of cotton fields, the cotton rose very little and the turnover last week totaled 219,300 tan. The cotton market situation has not escaped the hovering situation. It is necessary to test the weather of American cotton in the future to determine its advance and retreat. It is found that factories have purchased a lot of Indian cotton, importing 28,950 tan, and firms imported 1,080 tan of American cotton, which is down 10 pounds from the previous week. The amount purchased by each party is listed below.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea: The Silk Market Was Extremely Pessimistic Last Week</h3>
<p>Overseas Summer Vacation Shutdown...Silk Telegrams Even Less Likely to Turn to Shanghai</p>
<p>Silk Prices Clearly Flat, Secretly Falling...Chinese and Foreign Attitudes Negative</p>
<p>The silk market in this city last week lacked progress. It was found that Japanese silk merchants in overseas markets were competing to sell at low prices, which benefited Yokohama's silk exports. European and American silk stocks were also increasing, and various silk weaving factories were temporarily shutting down for summer vacation due to the humid heat, further reducing silk consumption. Wires from Chinese silk merchants complained of high prices, making it even less likely for silk to turn to Shanghai. Exchange rates increased, and silk prices were clearly flat but secretly falling. European traders also dared not risk hoarding. Silk factories in Shanghai were reducing work hours and shutting down machines during the summer vacation. Both Chinese and foreign silk merchants adopted a negative attitude. Silk sales almost stopped last week, with total sales of only about 200 bales. About 1,000 bales of raw silk were exported. The summer cocoon harvest in Zhejiang Province was poor, and prices were high. Summer cocoons in Suzhou and Sichuan almost entirely disappeared. A small number of summer cocoons recently harvested were of poor quality and unsuitable for silk factory raw materials. Chinese silk merchants adopted an increasingly pessimistic outlook. Although the decline in overseas Chinese silk prices was slight, the rising exchange rate made prices look even weaker. A list of the market prices of Chinese silk overseas at the end of last week is provided below (New York price per pound, unit: gold yuan; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: francs).</p>

<h3>Hardware: French and Western Nail Sales Increase Secretly</h3>
<p>Recently, the French and Western nail have been more popular due to the strong interest of the building industry, and the market situation has been very good, so the opening price is also very firm.

Although the market was closed yesterday due to the day of the week, the opening was still as much as 4-500 barrels, and there were also 6-700 barrels of road cargo that were approved. The market quotation opened at 7 taels 4 qian 5 fen for spot goods and 7 taels 3 qian for futures, but the dark plate for better grades was better by one or two cents. It is heard that the Chinese goods market has been increasing, and the market price of imported goods may have to rise again.</p>

<p>All Trade Associations Unanimously Urge</p>
<h3>Chairman Xu of the City Chamber of Commerce Takes Office</h3>
<p>Chairman Xu Jiqing of the City Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly declined to take office since being elected. Although the executive and supervisory committee members of the association have tried various means to persuade him, all have been ineffective. The other four standing committee members also found it inconvenient to act as proxies for a long time and stopped attending meetings to handle official business from the previous day. All documents sent to Chairman Xu for review were returned, causing the association's affairs to be virtually suspended. More than 40 organizations, including the National Medicine Trade Association of this city, believe that the City Chamber of Commerce is the highest-level commercial organization in the city and is of great importance to the interests of merchants. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter urging him to take office, hoping that Chairman Xu, who always prioritizes the interests of merchants, will satisfy their aspirations. The original text of the letter is recorded below: To Mr. Xu, Recently, we read in the newspaper that you were elected Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce. Our association and others are celebrating the appointment of a capable person. However, we have heard that you have repeatedly declined the position. Although the executive and supervisory committee members have tried various means to persuade you, they have been unable to change your decision to resign. Now, we have learned that all the standing committee members will also follow your example and resign, suspending all official business. Upon hearing this news, our association and others are extremely alarmed. The City Chamber of Commerce is responsible for leading the commercial operations of the entire city. It is located in a place of great importance both domestically and internationally. At a time when the world is in turmoil and business is in decline, the committee members should do their best to work together, not be afraid of difficulties, and jointly deal with the situation. However, due to your humility and resignation, the Chamber of Commerce is in a state of suspension. If an unexpected event occurs as a result, how will you answer to the merchants of the city? Your great virtue and humility are certainly sufficient to encourage the public, but the position of Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce is an obligation, not a right. Since the public has placed their trust in you, you should take on the arduous task and not decline the position. Competition can lead to change, and humility can also ruin things. You are wise and do not need to think deeply. Our association is concerned about the vital interests of the industry and is extremely anxious. Therefore, we urge you to take office as soon as possible to relieve the anxiety of the public. We have always admired your enthusiasm for public welfare and your familiarity with the pros and cons of the situation. We believe that you will satisfy the expectations of our association. We are looking forward to your instructions.

<h3>County Land Tax Collection Scheduled to Begin</h3>
<p>Starting August 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai County's 19th annual summer and autumn land tax is now scheduled to be collected starting August 1st, according to Director Wang of the County Finance Bureau. He has ordered the tax collectors to expedite all procedures, such as compiling tax records and notices, so that they can be distributed to all businesses for payment when the time comes. Director Wang also checked that a large amount of the 18th-year winter grain tax is still owed by the people. He had previously summoned all the tax collectors and instructed them to collect all outstanding taxes within five "mao" (every five days). However, the deadline has passed, and many are still delaying payment, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, yesterday, he strictly instructed all tax collectors to inform all the village chiefs and headmen to collect all the owed winter grain before the start of the summer and autumn tax collection. If there are any further delays, consequences will follow.</p>

<p>Workers Detained: Xiao Zhengfa, a worker from the Water and Electricity Workers' Union, saw two new workers on Lujiabang Road yesterday riding in a car to repair damaged water pipes. He immediately went forward to dissuade them. Two Westerners who had come with the new workers started a conflict and beat Xiao's wrist with an iron rod, causing him to bleed profusely. The Westerners then fled. The patrol officer from the Second District Public Security Bureau sent Xiao and the new workers to the Second District Headquarters for interrogation. After hearing the news, the union immediately requested permission from higher authorities to release Xiao on bail for treatment.</p>
<p>The Union Expresses: Yesterday and today are French Democratic Memorial Days, and the French Concession is scheduled to hold a grand lantern parade. Unexpectedly, the French Concession power supply suddenly failed the night before, causing the lights in the prosperous city to go out suddenly. Now that the festival has arrived, the factory is afraid that such an unfortunate event will occur again. In addition to sending people to repair the damage, the police have asked Mr. Du Yuesheng to relay a message to the striking workers not to allow workers to take any action outside during these two days. Xu A'mei, a member of the union's standing committee, replied, saying that the workers' actions are extremely peaceful and there is absolutely no out-of-bounds behavior. The incidents of smashing trams outside in recent days were definitely not done by the workers, but by reactionary elements taking the opportunity to act. As for the accidents in water and electricity, they were caused by the new workers not knowing how to repair the equipment and not taking precautions beforehand, which led to sudden damage. The factory's insistence that the old workers were responsible for the damage is truly unjust. It can be formally stated to Mr. Du that the union workers can guarantee that there will be no destructive actions and that they will use formal methods to achieve a resolution. Moreover, the City Party Department has convened a meeting of government and military officials to discuss solutions to the strike. The union should wait quietly for a resolution. It has also notified all workers of this, and so on.</p>
<p>Preparing a Support Association: The situation of various trade unions supporting the French business water and electricity striking workers has been reported previously. Now, it is learned that over sixty organizations, including the Postal Workers' Union, the British and American Union, the Commercial Union, and the Xiang Sheng Union, have jointly signed a petition to the City Party Department to form a support association for the record. The union is about to be established, and the strike may expand soon.</p>

<h3>The Six Harmony County Party Department Unauthorizedly Sends a Telegram</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Party Affairs Rectification Committee yesterday sent a telegram saying: To the Party Departments of all counties: Our Committee recently sent a document to the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs Rectification Committee, titled "Request for Forwarding." Our committee has repeatedly received many telegrams from the Six Harmony and other county party departments, all of which arbitrarily attack the superior party committee members. At a time when the situation is unstable, reactionary forces are rampant, and the Jiangsu party affairs have not yet been completely rectified, if the superior committee members have indeed been negligent, they should be corrected through proper procedures. However, they do not follow this and instead arbitrarily send telegrams attacking the superior party committee members. This is not allowed by party ethics and party discipline and is inconsistent with the central government's orders. Our committee's 29th committee meeting resolved to submit a request to the province to be forwarded to the central government to strictly prohibit and investigate this matter and to send telegrams to all counties to jointly request this matter. This is for the benefit of the party. We respectfully request your committee's review and forwarding to strictly prohibit and investigate this matter to maintain party discipline.</p>
<h3>Shanghai City to Electrically Divide into Districts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Government previously received an order from the Executive Yuan to redivide the entire city into districts within three months. After receiving the order, the City Government ordered the municipal committee members of the thirteen districts under its jurisdiction, such as Wusong, to quickly investigate and report on the area, population, rivers, and transportation of each district separately as a basis for verification and handling. After the redivision of districts in the future, all the original district municipal committee members will be immediately abolished. In accordance with the regulations of the Legislative Yuan, a district chief will be appointed to manage the administrative affairs of each district. As for how the district chiefs will be selected, the City Government has now stipulated that the original district municipal committee members will organize a research class and simultaneously recruit students to establish a training class. Once the research and training period is completed, the qualified personnel will be assigned to the districts as district chiefs, and the trainees will be assigned to the districts as assistant members.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Consumer Cooperatives Amidst the Movement's Promotion</h3>
<p>Since the city's party and government agencies jointly held a cooperative movement promotion week in compliance with the central government's orders, all sectors of the city have felt that the organization of cooperatives is indeed the first step in solving people's livelihood problems, and they have rushed to organize them. The following is a record of those that have been organized and those that are still in preparation:</p>
<p>The 18th Branch of the Fifth District: The 18th branch of the Fifth District of the city was initiated by Zhang Sheng, Zhang Meigen, Zhao Longsheng, Kang Shaoji, Ye Boyu, and others to organize the Summer Ice Drinks Consumer Cooperative.

<h3>Today's Meeting of Money Shops on Deposits in the Industrial and Commercial Bank</h3>
<p>Since the Industrial and Commercial Bank closed down, few in the financial community have been affected. Most money shops have deposits but no debts. The bank has now asked accountants to settle the accounts. Because the deposits of various money shops are indeed a considerable amount, the British firm of McGarey Bank owes the bank a total of more than 170,000 taels. Knowing that the money shops still have deposits in the bank, it has discussed with the money shops the desire to transfer all the deposits in the name of the Industrial and Commercial Bank to McGarey to cover the debts. The Tongren Law Firm is mediating. Yesterday, it notified the money shops to hold a meeting at the Tongren Law Firm at 9 AM this morning to discuss the matter. If the money shops agree, the deposits in the name of the Industrial and Commercial Bank can be transferred to McGarey immediately to complete the formalities.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Book Cover Industry to Waive the Covering of Books</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Book Cover Industry Association has been formally established. In response to the request of the majority of members, it is announcing the waiver of the covering of books. In addition to submitting requests to the city party department and other competent authorities to uphold justice and prevent coercion, it is also publishing an announcement to seek public opinion and promote justice. The announcement is as follows: We, the members of the book cover industry, are all small and medium-sized merchants facing difficulties. At a time when rice is expensive and prices are soaring, it is already difficult to maintain our livelihoods. How can we endure the oppression and increase our suffering? Taking the forceful covering of books published by various bookshops as an example, the rule of covering books was originally non-existent. The bureaucrat with an understanding of reason still abide by the old rules and do not force us to cover. However, the tyrannical bullies have broken the old rules and forced us to cover, using all means of coercion, intimidation, and instigation. Those who obey me live; those who disobey me die. With a haughty attitude and deceitful tricks, they triumphantly proclaim that upright members of the association are being undermined and sample books are being cut off. Weak and ignorant members of the industry are being exploited, daring to take risks. They do not think that to cover five hundred books requires covering every day, wasting labor and time, reducing production capacity, and incurring invisible losses throughout the year that are difficult to calculate. Except for those who make unreasonable demands and rely on power to humiliate others, there is nothing more unequal in the world than this. This is completely contrary to the Prime Minister's legacy of developing people's livelihood and increasing production. The association takes the relief of members' pain and the protection of the rights of the industry as its mission. Therefore, starting on July 2, it informed various bookstores by letter to sympathize with the difficulties of the industry and requested the waiver of book covering. However, some of the unreasonable people in the bureau still forced book covering and stopped issuing sample books, which is a violation of party law and disregards public reason. This is intolerable. Therefore, this announcement is issued to express our grievances and respectfully request public opinion to maintain justice.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Riding Without Tickets or Upgrading Seats</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway transport offices yesterday issued a special warning to the staff of the railways to prohibit riding without tickets or upgrading seats. The notice is recorded below for notification: It has recently been found that railway staff members often ride on trains without tickets or upgrading their seats, which is detrimental to railway regulations. The conductors and ticket inspectors of each train shall be responsible for strictly inspecting and verifying this. If such perfunctory negligence occurs again in the future, the office will investigate strictly. In addition, the train guards should pay attention to observing their car guard car. Except for those staff members who have a special permit to ride on the car in the long or short term, all others are not allowed to ride. The directors of the General Section and the resident directors of the Section should pay special attention to inspecting these two points at any time and report them for verification.</p>
<h3>The Completion of the Wireless Radio Station Constructed by the Dalaiyang Bank</h3>
<p>The ministry ordered the Wireless Radio Administration Bureau to manage it.</p>
<p>The Dalaiyang Bank in this port previously applied to the Ministry of Communications to establish a wireless radio station in Shanghai, which it funded and constructed itself, and was willing to have it managed by the Ministry of Communications. The construction has now been completed. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications yesterday ordered the Wireless Radio Administration Bureau to take over the management of the station.</p>
<h3>The Oil Cake Industry Cracks Down on Lightweight Dalian Cakes</h3>
<p>The soybean cake business is at its peak during the summer for all oil cake businesses. However, the Dalian bian cakes transported to various ports recently have reduced their weight. Merchants in various ports have questioned the industry, and some have returned the soybean cakes transported to Shanghai, causing significant losses to the business. Therefore, the businesses have discussed rectification and sent a letter to Dalian manufacturers not to transport lightweight Dalian bian cakes to Shanghai in a deceptive manner. However, recently, when the businesses presented the cakes to the foreign firms, the weight was still reduced. When the businesses stopped taking delivery of the cakes, they negotiated with the Dalian manufacturers stationed in Shanghai. The manufacturers shirked responsibility. The businesses believe that if they do not strictly crack down on this, the lightweight cakes will be transported to Shanghai and sold deceptively again in the future. Not only will the businesses suffer losses, but also the reputation and credit of the businesses transporting the cakes to the interior will be greatly affected. Therefore, after discussions, the businesses believe that this matter is related to the business and credit of the entire industry. They have no choice but to report it to the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, convene a meeting of the industry to strictly crack down on it, rectify the situation, and establish regulations.</p>

<p>The Fresh Rice Shop Stevedores' Union issued a declaration opposing the sale of telephone services in the concession, stating that the concession is Chinese territory, and telephone public utilities should be state-owned. The China and Foreign Telephone Company, without the permission of our government, has audaciously sold the telephone services to an international company. This preposterous act demonstrates the imperialists' long-standing ambition to invade China. This private transaction is outrageous and infuriating. It disregards our national sovereignty and violates public opinion. We, the union workers, are outraged and will not allow ourselves to be exploited. The loss of national rights leaves us no room for silence. To ensure the survival of our nation, we must follow the lead of our countrymen and resist unanimously, providing diplomatic support to ensure the recovery of state-owned enterprises and self-management. This declaration is made to this effect.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Postal Worker Embezzles Funds and Comes to Shanghai to Enjoy Himself</h3>
<p>Arrested While in Bed with a Prostitute</p>
<p>Many Cosmetics Found in His Wallet</p>
<p>Now Sent to Nanjing Court for Trial</p>
<p>Lu Shanqing (also known as Wang Rende), a postal messenger from the Nanjing Postal Branch and a native of Suzhou, was ordered by the postmaster in February of this year to take 500 yuan to the General Bureau to collect postal stamps. Lu embezzled the money and fled by train to Shanghai. When the train arrived in Suzhou, Lu changed his mind and got off in Suzhou, hiding in his mistress's place for several days before going alone to Shanghai and staying at room 58 of the World Hotel on Aiduya Road. He used the embezzled public funds to buy Western-style clothing and indulge in wine and women, appearing like a wealthy young master. However, since Lu fled with the embezzled money, the Nanjing Branch reported the matter to the Capital General Bureau. In addition to requesting the military police in the capital to investigate and arrest him, a letter was sent to the Shanghai General Bureau for assistance. Recently, Tao Gongchen, the chief investigator of the General Bureau, discovered his whereabouts and reported the matter to the Old Gate Police Station. Detective Cui Chengke was dispatched to search the hotel. Upon entering his room, Lu was found in bed with a prostitute. The detective chased the prostitute away and arrested Lu. A search of his wallet found 35 yuan of remaining cash. Opening his suitcase, they also found 400 yuan in banknotes, a gold watch, and various cosmetics. The day before yesterday, he was escorted to the Special District Local Court. Because the case occurred in Nanjing, the post office sent a representative to the court to request that the case be transferred to the competent court for trial. Judge Sun briefly questioned the defendant, ordered him to be detained, and ordered the stolen money to be returned to the plaintiff. The gold watch and other items were temporarily confiscated.</p>
<h3>Revenge Shooting Accidentally Injures Neighbor Case</h3>
<p>The Injured Man Has a Limp</p>
<p>Lu A'gen Had Previously Committed Theft</p>
<p>Wang Yuhong, a carpenter at the British American Tobacco Factory in Pudong, was injured in the arm by a worker named Zhu Jinglin. Wang then gathered Lu A'gen, Feng A'qing, and others, armed with guns, and went to Zhu's house with the intention of killing him. Unexpectedly, a bullet flew out and hit Xu Guangzhi, Zhu's neighbor, in the left leg. The police arrested Lu A'gen, Feng A'qing, and Wang Yuhong. Under interrogation, it was discovered that Lu A'gen had previously robbed Li Pu's gold jewelry. As a result, the Public Security Bureau sent Zhu Jinglin, Wang Yuhong, Lu A'gen, and Feng A'qing to the Local Court, all of whom were detained. Xu Guangzhi was sent to the hospital for treatment. He has now recovered, but has a limp. The case has been investigated by the prosecutor, who has filed a public prosecution on charges of murder and robbery. Judge Zhao held a court hearing yesterday. The defendant Zhu Jinglin testified that he was 35 years old, from Suqian, and worked as a worker in a cigarette factory, residing at No. 10, Thirteen Rooms, Pudong. On the morning of May 19, he accidentally injured Wang Yuhong's arm while taking wood boards. Dong Meiyu and others came out to mediate, and everyone settled the matter. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 20th, Wang Yuhong brought Lu A'gen, Feng A'qing, and more than 20 others. Lu A'gen took a gun and fired four shots. He didn't hit me, but the bullet hit Xu Guangzhi. The defendant Wang Yuhong testified that he was 25 years old, from Ninghai, residing at No. 284, Yangjiazhai, working as a carpenter. I went to get wood boards, but Zhu Jinglin wouldn't let me take them and beat me. Dong Meiyu and Huang Keguang mediated, and both sides agreed not to cause trouble. I don't know Lu A'gen and Feng A'qing. The defendant Lu A'gen testified that he was 19 years old, from Tongzhou, residing in Tilanqiao. I don't know Wang Yuhong. I was arrested on my way to Pudong to visit my mother. The confession I made in the police station about firing the gun and robbing the gold jewelry was forced by them. The defendant Feng A'qing testified that he was 27 years old, from Ningbo, and worked as a worker. I don't know Wang Yuhong. On May 20, my friend Chen Sanbao asked me to learn silk and bamboo instruments. I was mistakenly arrested while passing by. The witness Dong Meiyu testified that she was 30 years old, from Shaoxing, residing in Yangjiazhai. We mediated for Zhu Jinglin and others and guaranteed that there would be no more fighting in the factory. We are not concerned about outside matters. I did not know about the revenge on May 20. According to Fei Keguang, 37 years old, residing in Yangjiazhai, I mediated for them on May 19, but I don't know what happened afterward. But on May 20, when they were seeking revenge, they indeed fired a gun. During the Third District's interrogation, they also said that Lu A'gen fired the gun. According to He Wang, 39 years old, from Ningbo, residing at No. 17, Huayuan Lane, Dadongmen, I don't know about Wang Yuhong's cohabitation and fights. I don't know Li Pu, and I don't know about the robbery of her gold jewelry. The victim Xu Guangzhi testified that he was 21 years old, from Suqian, residing at No. 11, Thirteen Rooms. I don't know why they were fighting. I was eating dinner in the house and saw many people coming to find Zhu Jinglin. Before I could say three words, they fired a gun and injured my right leg. Although I'm better now, it's difficult to walk. At this point in the interrogation, the judge ordered the defendants to be detained, and the others were dismissed to await further investigation.</p>
<h3>So Many Corpses Floating in Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Four Bodies Recovered in Two Days</p>
<p>One Body Suspected to Be a White Russian</p>
<p>Recently, floating corpses have been appearing on the banks of Suzhou Creek. Since the suicide by drowning of artist Chen Boying, four more bodies have been found in the past two days. The details obtained are recorded below:</p>
<p>Near the Niaozhen Road Bridge The day before yesterday (the 12th), an unidentified male corpse was found near the Niaozhen Road Bridge in Zhabei. He was about 30 years old, of medium build, with complete limbs and no visible injuries. He was wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, barefoot, and generally obese. The body was retrieved by the Zhabei Qiliu Public Office. It was observed that the corpse's face resembled a Russian. The New Gate Police Station was immediately notified to send investigators to examine the body. The body was wearing Chinese-style clothing and had 106 copper coins in its pocket. It was determined that he was not a White Russian stranded in China. The office took photographs and prepared the body for collection.</p>
<p>Near the Old Gate Bridge The day before yesterday (the 12th), a male corpse suddenly floated near the Old Gate Bridge. He was about 40 years old, wearing blue cloth shirt and pants, of medium build, and resembling a coolie. The body was already decomposing. No relatives were found. The Zhabei Charity Group collected the body.</p>
<p>Near Caojiadu Yesterday (the 13th), the Zhabei Charity Group recovered an unidentified male corpse near Caojiadu. He was about 30 years old, and his face was so decomposed that he could not be identified. He was completely naked and appeared to have drowned after accidentally falling into the river while swimming. No family members were found. The group collected the body to await collection.</p>
<p>Under the Hengfeng Road Bridge Gou Xiaohongzi, a 13-year-old boy from Yancheng County, Jiangbei, fell into the river near the Hengfeng Road Bridge in Zhabei yesterday morning (the 13th). He was seen and retrieved by employees of the Qiliu Public Office, but he had already died. The body was taken to the office for temporary placement. After a while, Gou Xiaohongzi's father, Gou Lao Si, whose son had been out for a long time and had not returned, heard that a child had fallen into the river and tragically drowned. He went to the office to see the body and recognized his son. Grief-stricken, he wept over the body and claimed it for burial. It is said that Xiaohongzi's parents are both alive and he has siblings. His father is a boatman on Suzhou Creek and the family is poor. According to eyewitnesses, Xiaohongzi did not fall in by accident, but was pushed in by someone else. Although Gou Lao Si is poor, he loves this son very much and plans to report the matter to the nearby police station to seek justice.</p>
<h3>Electricity Restored in French Concession Yesterday</h3>
<p>The streetlights on the French Concession's Gongguan Road, from the west end of Baxianqiao to the east end of Zhengjia Muqiao Street, as well as those on Caishi Street, Aiduya Road (south side), Ningbo Road, and the east and west Xinqiao Streets, suddenly went out at 11:15 p.m. the other night, plunging the area into darkness. This was reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the electricity company, due to the ongoing strike of water and electrical workers, lacked repair craftsmen. A foreign engineer supervised six White Russian workers to repair the lights in various locations overnight. The police station in charge, fearing that bandits would take the opportunity to rob, dispatched a patrol car of the Fei Road Police Station, fully loaded with armed Chinese and Western officers, to patrol the darkened area all night. The Russian workers worked until 4:30 p.m. yesterday (the 13th) to repair the section of the wire, and the lights were turned back on, restoring the original situation.</p>

<h3>Tragedy at French Concession Lantern Festival</h3>
<p>Eight-Year-Old Boy Severely Burned</p>
<p>Last night, a lantern festival was held in the French Concession. The Mingxing Film Company specially made a large table stand with three men and three women sitting on it, all nude. At about 10:00 p.m., while passing the French Consulate, fireworks were set off. A boy named Chen Youfu, only eight years old and a local, was severely burned all over his body. The police on the street quickly sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>A Suspicious Couple on the Shanghai-Taicang Long-Distance Bus</h3>
<p>Enticement and Escape</p>
<p>Police Break the Case</p>
<p>At around 3:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, two passengers on the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus, which originated in Liuhe, behaved suspiciously. When the bus arrived at the Luodian Station, a policeman stationed at the station of the Third Branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau noticed them. The couple looked flustered and spoke evasively when questioned. A search of their luggage revealed women's clothing and valuable gold and silver items, further arousing suspicion. The policeman took the couple to the bureau, where Chief Gao Xitian interrogated them separately. The man said his name was Han Tongde, 24 years old, and the woman's name was Han Lu, 26 years old. They both claimed to be uncle and sister-in-law, and that Lu was traveling from her home in Liuhe to Shanghai to return to Ningbo, and was being escorted by her uncle. Repeated questioning revealed no flaws in their story. However, Chief Gao remembered seeing the man when he was the head of the judicial section of the Baoshan County Government, and had dealt with a case of him enticing women. He determined that they were definitely not good people and immediately ordered the police to go to Jiading to check the address they provided. It was discovered that Han Lu's real name was Wu Han, and she was indeed escaping from her husband, Wu Zhongjun, who was searching for her everywhere. The police then returned to the bureau with Wu to report the case. He claimed that Han Tongde was not his brother, nor was his name Han, but Yan A'xiang. He begged for the couple to be severely punished for enticing and escaping with his wife. At this point, Han and Yan A'xiang lowered their heads and admitted to the enticement and escape without denying. Chief Gao, after reviewing the confession, considered the case to be criminal and ordered the police to escort them to the Baoshan County Government for handling yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Extended Clinic Hours at the Labor Hospital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Labor Hospital on Xiaoshadu Road recently decided to increase the clinic hours, as there has been a large number of people seeking treatment due to the hot weather and the prevalence of epidemics. In addition to setting up a temporary epidemic department in the South City, the hospital's medical affairs committee has also decided to increase the treatment hours at the main hospital, from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. every day. It is said that the hospital treats about 800 people every day, not including inpatients.</p>
<h3>Judicial Administration Department Appoints Judges for On-the-Job Training</h3>
<p>The Judicial Administration Department of the National Government announced a large number of judicial appointments at the beginning of this month, assigning them to all levels of courts as trainee judges, trainee prosecutors, and trainee clerks, so that they could gain practical experience. Those appointed were required to report to their respective courts within ten days of receiving their certificates. It is said that the Special District Local Court has been assigned eleven trainee judges and five or six trainee prosecutors by the department. They are arriving one after another in recent days, and the number of judges in the court has increased dramatically.</p>
<h3>County Construction Bureau Formulates Implementation Plan for This Year's Construction</h3>
<p>Since taking office last year, Wu Wenhua, the director of the Shanghai County Construction Bureau, has spared no effort in planning local construction, and local people have praised him greatly. Director Wu has now completed the draft of the county's construction implementation plan for the 19th year. It is divided into roads, water conservancy, municipal administration, public works, and relocation. It has been printed and bound, and is being submitted to the Jiangsu Construction Department and the Shanghai County Government. It is also being distributed to various agencies for review.</p>
<h3>Public Security Bureau Bids for White Uniforms</h3>
<p>Director Yuan of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, considering that the weather is extremely hot in the summer, and that the yellow uniforms worn by the senior police officers are too thick, causing them to sweat profusely when standing in the hot sun, should follow the precedent and switch to white twill uniforms. Bids have been invited to contract the manufacture of the uniforms, which will be short-sleeved student-style. Each set will cost only one yuan and four jiao (in previous years, the price was one yuan and eight jiao to two yuan for equal quality). All uniforms must be delivered within 20 days so that they can be distributed to the districts and teams. All material and labor costs of one yuan and four jiao have been ordered to be deducted from the July and August salaries of the officers.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Preserve Burial Ground Movement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Siming Association previously discussed a proposal to build houses on the vacant land in Beifuli, French Concession. Ningbo fellow townsmen, after discovering that the land was originally a burial ground with many fellow townsmen's remains, were extremely concerned and jointly sent a letter to the board of directors requesting preservation, but received no response. The fellow townsmen then established the Temporary Great Meeting of Preservation of Tombs of Fellow Townsmen at 901 Dong Hanbili Road, with Wang Ruilong as the representative. Mr. Wang had previously learned that some unscrupulous people were spreading rumors that the land was not a charitable burial ground, misleading the directors. Yesterday, representatives from the Stack Industry Charity Association, the Yongji Society, and the Yan Ying Society, along with workers supervised by Liu Jinpu, excavated the site and found dozens of coffins of various sizes. Representatives have been sent to the board of directors of the Siming Association to request a joint inspection, and an emergency preservation meeting will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association next Sunday. It is believed that the truth will be revealed and that a permanent preservation plan can be negotiated.</p>
<h3>Madame Soong Is Unwell</h3>
<p>Madame Soong, the mother of Finance Minister Soong Zi-wen, has been unwell since this spring. Due to the recent hot weather, she is in poor spirits and has moved to a sanatorium in Shanghai for recuperation. Minister Soong is busy with official duties and has not had time to care for her day and night. His younger brother, Soong Zi-liang, the director of the general affairs department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has a strong sense of filial piety and has returned to Shanghai from the capital to care for her day and night in the sanatorium, hoping that she will recover soon.</p>
<h3>Huai'an Bandit Yan Chunsu Arrested in Dongjiadu</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Committed Robbery, Arson, and Murder</p>
<p>Yan Chunsu, a bandit from Huai'an, fled to Shanghai after committing robbery, murder, arson, and other crimes in his hometown last spring. He was hiding in the home of a fellow townsman, Lu Hongzi, in Dongjiadu, Pudong. Recently, Yang Meizi, a relative of the victim, discovered Yan's hiding place and secretly reported it to the Yangjing District Security Corps. The Corps arrested Yan, along with Lu Hongzi, and handed them over to the Third District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. According to Yang Meizi, 35 years old, from Huai'an, residing near the Yongtai Stack in Jiadu, Pudong, and working as a coolie, my brother-in-law, Yan Hongyi, lived in Yanjiazhuang, Machangzhen, Northern Township, Huai'an, and worked as a carpenter. He owned dozens of acres of fertile land and had some savings. Last spring, Yan Chunsu wrote a letter threatening to extort him, but failed. On the night of the fourth day of the third lunar month, he gathered seven or eight accomplices, armed with weapons, and robbed him of several hundred yuan. My brother-in-law and sister were killed. I reported the case to the county for investigation and ordered the arrest of the murderers. However, Yan Chunsu held a grudge and set fire to their house before fleeing to Shanghai. Now that I have discovered his whereabouts, I have reported it for arrest. Yan Chunsu said that he was 22 years old, from Huai'an, and came to Shanghai on the 16th of last month. He lived in Dongjiadu, opposite the Zilaihuo Factory, in the home of a friend named Lu Fengzi, and worked as a coolie on the docks. The murder of Yan Hongyi and his wife and the arson case last year was committed by Yan's uncle, Yan Siqing, and his gang. I helped out, but I was not the main culprit and ask for leniency.</p>

<p>Director Zhang considered the case to be a major one involving robbery, murder, and arson, and ordered Yan to be detained pending transfer to the Local Court.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Pays Out 3,600 Yuan in Wages and Is Robbed</h3>
<p>Three Bandits Drive Up and Rob</p>
<p>Zhang A'fu Is Shocked and Horrified</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiu Shun Silk Factory in Zhoujia Lane behind Tanjia Bridge, Zhabei, sent its tea house attendant, Zhang A'fu (33 years old, from Tongzhou), to the Yuanda Money Exchange in Bentang Lane, Public Concession, to collect 3,600 yuan in cash to pay out wages at around 8:00 a.m. After receiving the money, Zhang hired a rickshaw to return to the factory. However, while passing the Yangzhou Public Office on Pushan Road, three bandits riding bicycles suddenly appeared. Two of the bandits were wearing white shirts and black pants, and one was wearing white clothes and blue pants. All spoke with a Jiangbei accent. One of the bandits pulled out a gun and ordered Zhang to get out of the rickshaw and hand over the money. Zhang, fearing the weapon, dared not disobey and handed over a cloth bag containing 3,600 yuan. The bandits then grabbed the stolen money, got on their bicycles, and sped away. In an instant, they disappeared. After being robbed, Zhang was stunned and did not shout for help. He calmly returned to the factory and reported the incident. The factory's guard, Shi Yushan, reported the incident to the Fourth District General Office. By the time the detectives arrived to pursue them, the bandits were long gone.</p>
<h3>A Woman's Three Marriages</h3>
<p>Changshu resident Zhang Abing, represented by lawyer Yan Jinyu, filed a complaint in the public court, stating that in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff, through matchmaker Zhang Axiang in his hometown, married Zhang Caoshi as his wife, paying a bride price of 200 yuan. However, in the 17th year, Zhang Axiang came and claimed that Cao was already married. To avoid trouble, the plaintiff had to pay an additional 200 yuan. Shortly after, the defendant, Zhang Axiang, stole 6 yuan. In April of this year, Zhang Axiang abducted Cao to Shanghai. The plaintiff tracked them to Shanghai and discovered that Zhang and Cao were cohabitating in the Yunzhou Hotel in Baoxing Lane, Dongxin Bridge. He reported this to the police, who arrested the defendants. It was found that Zhang Axiang was an unemployed rogue from Changshu who conspired with Cao to defraud money. The plaintiff requested that they be severely punished according to the law. During the interrogation, Zhang Caoshi confessed that she had been married three times. First, she married a villager from Changshu. After divorcing, she married Lin Asheng, who sold zici rice. Lin Asheng and Zhang Axiang conspired to sell her to the plaintiff as his wife. At first, they lived peacefully, but then Zhang Axiang came to Changshu and brought her to Shanghai. The rest of her testimony was evasive. Zhang Axiang confessed that Cao was indeed sold to the plaintiff by Lin Asheng, who sold zici rice, for 100 yuan. He also stated that Cao voluntarily came to Shanghai with the plaintiff. Judge Zhu sentenced Zhang Axiang to six months in the western jail and Zhang Caoshi to three months as a warning.</p>
<h3>Wife Accuses Husband of Hiring Someone to Harm Her</h3>
<p>Conflicting Accounts from Both Parties</p>
<p>Zhou Fanshi, a woman from Yancheng residing at No. 117, Feng Tanzi Bay, Zhabei, yesterday accused her husband, Zhou Ganchen, of bribing Deng Huai's son, Deng Burong, to attempt to murder her. At the Fourth District Police Station, Director Jin questioned the plaintiff, Zhou Fanshi, who stated that she was 24 years old and had been married to the defendant, Zhou Ganchen, for over a year. He was very attentive to her when they were first married, but as time went on, he grew tired of her and repeatedly wanted to divorce her. She refused because a woman should only have one husband. He treated her like discarded shoes and often beat her. Yesterday, he even paid Deng Huai's son, Bule, to hide a sharp knife and kill her. Fortunately, she noticed and escaped, avoiding death. Because her husband is so dangerous, she feared for her life and went to the station to seek justice. Deng Huaicheng stated that the plaintiff accused his son of taking a bribe to commit murder, but his son lives elsewhere, and they have not seen each other in a long time. He knows nothing about it. Zhou Ganchen completely denied the accusations. Deng Burong also denied everything. Because the case involves attempted murder and the testimonies are conflicting, the case was transferred to the judicial section for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Widows Remarrying Not Prohibited by Law</h3>
<p>Qian Wangshi's son, Qian Wangwan, a resident of Pingmin Village, Hujia Mu Bridge, died of illness last October. His wife, Qian Xushi, was 25 years old and lonely. Before her husband's bones were cold, she asked someone to be a matchmaker to remarry. On the 9th of this month, matchmakers Zhu Shuzhang, Zhu Wanchang, Yang Fukui, etc., arranged for her to marry Song Suzhang. Qian Xushi did not inform her mother-in-law and remarried the Song family. Qian Wangshi found out and, along with his eldest son, Qian Xiaogou, and nephew, Xu Zuoqing, went to the Fifth District Third Sub-station to accuse Qian Xushi and the three matchmakers. Yesterday, they were taken to the local court. After a preliminary hearing by the prosecutor, they were all released because widows remarrying is not prohibited by law.</p>
<h3>Su Wenxiu Accused of Raping a Nine-Year-Old Child</h3>
<p>Hospital Examination Confirmed Defilement</p>
<p>Su Still Absolutely Denies It</p>
<p>Zhou Zhou, a woman from Shandong, and Su Wenxiu, from Anhui, rented rooms upstairs at 1312 Xin Puyi Lane, Macao Road. Zhou lived in a small room in the pavilion, while Su lived in the back building. Zhou's daughter, Shun Yuan, is only nine years old. Zhou reported to the Putuo Road Police Station that Su had raped her daughter in April. Two months later, she reported the incident. The police dispatched officers to arrest Su and sent the girl to the hospital for examination. The other day, Su was sent to the Special District Local Court. Judge Sun Yuan presided over the trial. Police lawyer Li Zhishan first stated that Su was being prosecuted for indecent assault under Section 2 of Article 241 of the Criminal Law. He then said that the police, based on Zhou's report, sent her daughter to the hospital, where doctors confirmed that the girl's private parts were injured and that she was suffering from leucorrhea. Judge Sun then questioned the plaintiff, Zhou Zhou, who stated that the defendant's daughter, Su Jinyou, was the same age as her daughter. The other day, Su's daughter told her that her father had lured her daughter into his room last month under the pretext of showing her pictures of cigarette advertisements and then raped her. She asked her daughter, who said that she had been raped because the defendant had threatened her so she did not dare to speak out. Her daughter also said that the defendant probed her private parts with his fingers and laid on top of her twice. In April, when she was washing her daughter's clothes, she saw bloodstains but did not suspect anything and did not investigate. Zhou Shun Yuan also testified, but her words were confusing and incoherent. The defendant, Su Wenxiu, 36 years old, absolutely denied the rape accusation. The court ordered the defendant to be detained, the girl to be examined by the court's forensic doctor, and the hearing to be adjourned for seven days.</p>
<h3>Price Increase for Biscuits, Candy, and Canned Goods</h3>
<p>Effective Immediately</p>
<p>The Shanghai Biscuit, Candy, and Canned Food Trade Association, noting that the raw materials used by the industry are mostly foreign and that it is difficult to profit due to the recent impact of gold prices, convened several meetings and decided to increase prices appropriately to maintain operations. The announcement is excerpted below: Announcement: After investigation, although many of the raw materials used in our industry are domestically produced, such as sugar, spices, colors, tinplate for cans, and printing paper, they are either directly or indirectly mostly supplied by foreign countries. Recently, affected by the price of gold, they have all risen sharply, doubling the cost and making it difficult to maintain operations. The only way to remedy this is to appropriately increase prices to provide support. The association has convened a general meeting and decided that the prices of biscuits, regardless of coarse or fine, bulk, or canned, will be increased by 10% across the board; the prices of all kinds of hard and soft candies and fancy candies will be increased by 10% across the board; and the price of canned meat, vegetables, and fruits will be increased by 2 to 4 cents per can. It is hoped that all members will follow this uniformly to maintain capital and benefit business. This is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Drowning While Bathing in the Hu River</h3>
<p>Gu Ahu, a carpenter at the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway General Factory in Zhanghuabang, Songnan, had a cousin (name unknown) from Ningbo, about 30 years old, who was a vendor living in Zhanghuabang. At around 6 pm the other day, because the weather was extremely hot, he went to the Pu River to bathe. At the time, many workers and children were standing on the shore watching. The vendor swam in the shallow river for a while and then went ashore to get dressed. Just as he was about to turn around to go home, he heard the audience mocking him. Stimulated by these words, the vendor became arrogant and volunteered to go back into the water for a second swim to show off his skills. He bravely swam forward, but when he swam several feet away, the current became rapid and difficult to support. He wanted to turn around and go ashore, but it was too late, and he drowned. The audience was unable to rescue him and immediately reported it to his family, who came to the scene to search for the body. It has not yet been found. Yesterday, people were being hired to search for the body. It was said that whoever finds the body will be paid 30 yuan, and if no one finds it, they will be paid 6 yuan for their labor and food.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Thugs Destroy Property and Counter-Accuse of Bribery</h3>
<p>Self-Inflicted Harm, Detained Twice</p>
<p>Zhu Shunji Barber Shop, opened by Zhu Anhe on Hongqiao Road, Shanghai West, was suddenly vandalized on the 20th of last month by a group of thugs led by Wang Shigao from Anhui, along with his fellow villagers Hu Chenglong and Hu Xiaokuanzi. Zhu reported this to the Second Sub-station of the Sixth District Police Station, who handed the case over to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the court for investigation. Unexpectedly, after being released from the hospital the other day, Wang Shigao and others did not repent but dared to hire a lawyer to sue Zhu Anhe for bribing police officer Zhao Kunhe. The court scheduled a hearing for the 8th of this month. As a result, the case was dismissed for lack of evidence. Director Xu believed that police officer Zhao Kunhe had served for many years and was of good character, so he could not be falsely accused by troublemakers and damage the police's reputation. He arrested Wang Shigao, Hu Chenglong, Hu Xiaokuanzi, and others yesterday and prepared a document to send to the bureau for investigation according to the law.</p>
<h3>Collapsing Cart Injures Woman's Foot</h3>
<p>Shen Lin, a woman from Ningbo, 48 years old, residing at No. 7, Xiaopi Lane, Dongjiadu, was walking along Wanyu Street near her home at around 6 am the other day when a collapsing cart loaded with coal came towards her. She was unable to avoid it, and the wheels ran over her foot. Injured, she fell to the ground in pain, bleeding profusely. Zhang Tairen, a guard from the Seventh Post, learned of the incident and rushed the injured woman to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. He also detained the cart driver, Shao Yuansheng from Shaoxing, and the cart and took them to the First Sub-station of the First District. After a preliminary hearing by the director of the station, the case was transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>False Accusation of Theft and Assault</h3>
<p>Zhu Meng, a 26-year-old woman from Huaicheng residing at No. 1, Lane 6, Youchang Factory, Shanghai West, was falsely accused of stealing clothes by Liu Chunrong, who resides at No. 11, Yaoshui Lane. Zhu learned of this and went to Liu's residence at 7 am yesterday to question him. Liu and his wife, Wang, beat her to the ground without asking questions, causing injuries to her body. Zhu immediately called the police, who took Liu and his wife to the Sixth District Police Station. After separate interrogations by Director Ren, it was determined that the false accusation of theft and assault was appalling. The case was immediately transferred to the court for investigation. The names of both parties are listed below: Plaintiff: Zhu Meng, 26 years old, from Huaicheng. Defendant: Liu Chunrong, 19 years old, same origin, residing at No. 11, Yaoshui Lane; Liu Rufa, 22 years old; Liu Wang, 22 years old, both with the same origin and residence.</p>

<p>The thief, Wu Arong, was arrested by the police. He was sentenced by the former Provisional Court on June 18 of this year and sent to the Western Jail. He died on the 11th due to tuberculous enteritis, which was treated unsuccessfully. The police took the body to the forensic examination office on Ferry Road. At 10 am the next morning, they reported to the Special District Local Court and commissioned Prosecutor Guo to come to the office to examine the body. The head of the Western Jail reported the prisoner's illness and unsuccessful treatment. Because there were no family members, the body was ordered to be taken to Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>Laborer Dies After Argument with Woman</h3>
<p>Falls from Height, Iron Bar Injures Abdomen</p>
<p>Bleeding in the Large Intestine, Dies</p>
<p>Chen Wending, a 26-year-old man from Jiangyin, rented a room in a bungalow at the intersection of Yongxing Road and Gonghe New Road, Zhabei. Yesterday morning (the 11th), he was demolishing an old house in Junyi Lane, near Aerjin Road. A woman living at No. 141, Mingde Lane, was combing her hair beside a wall with a large basin full of clear water next to her. Chen, fearing that bricks would fall and injure people and that dust would fly and contaminate the clear water, told her to move to a better location and move the basin of water. Unexpectedly, the woman misunderstood him and thought he was insulting her. She started scolding him loudly, and Chen retorted. The demolition was getting closer, and the quarrel grew louder, with the two of them only inches apart. Because the wall was about 10 feet high, the woman tried to attack him and grabbed Chen's left foot with both hands. Chen was pulled and, unprepared, fell to the ground. He was holding an iron bar in his hand, which injured his abdomen, causing profuse bleeding. The police from Streets 2679 heard the news and rushed the injured man to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, the injury affected his internal organs, and he bled from his large intestine. After a doctor operated on him, his fever gradually increased, and he died at around 8 am yesterday. The body was taken to the forensic examination office for examination.</p>
<h3>Shamelessness of a Ribbon Weaver</h3>
<p>Takes Advantage of the Opportunity to Enter Neighbor's House</p>
<p>Intends to Commit Lewd Acts</p>
<p>Yuan Pugao, a tailor from Dongtai, 25 years old, currently runs a tailor shop on Chezhan Road, Nanshi. His wife, Zhu, is 26 years old and somewhat attractive. Yin Rongsheng, a ribbon weaver from Taixing, who lives nearby at No. 14, Rongren Lane, is frivolous by nature. As soon as he saw Zhu, evil thoughts arose. At 12:10 am yesterday morning, taking advantage of Yuan's absence, he sneaked into Zhu's bedroom intending to commit indecent acts. At this critical moment, Yuan returned home after finishing his work and discovered the intruder. For the sake of his reputation, Yuan suppressed his anger and did not confront him. However, at 10 am yesterday, Yuan became more and more angry and went to Rongren Lane to question Yin. Yin refused to yield, and the two men wrestled each other to the Chezhan Road Police Station of the Second District Police Station. The case was transferred to the Second District Police Station. After Director Wang questioned them, he determined that the case involved attempted rape and immediately prepared a document to transfer the case to the local court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Federation Expands Services</h3>
<p>Raising Funds to Build a New Headquarters</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the Overseas Chinese Federation of the Republic of China has a good reputation for handling overseas Chinese affairs. Recently, due to the expansion of services, the original headquarters was insufficient for office space. Therefore, it is planned to build a new headquarters. It is planned to first build a general headquarters in Shanghai, occupying an area of about one acre, with a five-story reinforced concrete building, including the Overseas Chinese Students Association, Overseas Chinese Introduction Office, Overseas Chinese Reception Hall, Overseas Chinese Industry Investigation Team, and other organizations. Branch headquarters will be built in Xiamen, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other areas. The construction cost is 600,000 yuan. The Overseas Chinese Federation has telegraphed overseas Chinese in Singapore and other places in Southeast Asia to raise funds. Construction will begin as soon as the funds are fully raised.</p>
<h3>Detention for Setting Up Altars and Performing Rituals</h3>
<p>Director Yuan of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau stated that every summer and autumn, well-meaning people borrow the name of the Yulanpen Festival, carry yellow paper booklets, and solicit donations from residents in various alleys. They then hire monks and Taoists to set up altars and perform rituals, claiming to drive away plagues and epidemics, but in reality, they are collecting money for their own benefit. This bad habit has long been a scourge to society. Now that superstitions are being eradicated, such incidents will not be tolerated again. Therefore, a strict ban has been issued, and all districts have been ordered to investigate and detain offenders. Unexpectedly, Ding Asan, a man from Yancheng, Jiangbei, residing at No. 77, Zhangjia Lane, Nancang Street, outside Xiaonanmen, recently set up an altar and performed rituals in the alley. Many Taoists chanted scriptures and performed rituals. The sound of gongs and drums could be heard far and wide. At around 10 pm, the patrol officer of the First Sub-station of the First District saw this, arrested Ding, and took him to the station. After a preliminary hearing by the director of the station, he was ordered to be detained pending further investigation and punishment for violating the ban.</p>
<h3>Thief Commits Numerous Crimes</h3>
<p>Wang Arezi, a man from Jiangbei, residing at No. 68, Huade Road, was carrying three Singer sewing machines at 4 am on the 4th of this month when he was stopped by Jin Yangzhao, an investigator from the Yangshupu Police Station, on Huade Road. Suspecting him, Jin arrested Wang and took him back to the police station for questioning. Wang confessed that the sewing machines were stolen from Cai Guisheng's house at No. 972, Huade Road. Wang was handed over to the Special District Court for trial and detention. Investigator Jin also discovered that Wang had committed eight other thefts: (1) A sewing machine from Wang Shaoqing's house at No. 50, Meizhou Road; (2) A sewing machine and other items from Wang Shaomei's house at No. 291, Yangzhou Road; (3) A sewing machine from Lu Shunfu's house at No. 206, Huishan Road; (4) A sewing machine from Tang Xisheng's house at No. 1044, Longjiang Road; (5) A sewing machine from Zhang Yougen's house at No. 251, Funing Road; (6) A clock from Zhou Bohua's house at No. 454, Meizhou Road; (7) Clothes, jewelry, checks, etc., from Wang Ziji's house at No. 311, Huade Road; (8) Clothes, etc., from Chen Jinlin's house, a local resident, on Longjiang Road. He reported this to the head of the police station, who ordered him to gather the original owners and send them to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>House Collapse Kills One Person</h3>
<p>Wei Liansheng's Unforeseen Disaster</p>
<p>At around 8:50 am yesterday, the kitchen of the Yitai Foreign Goods Store at No. 9, Taixin Lane, Huafa Min Road, suddenly collapsed due to years of disrepair. Wei Liansheng, a friend of the store's cook, arrived to visit. Because he was moving slowly, he was crushed in the lower level. The police learned of the incident and ordered investigators to the scene to provide assistance and ordered laborers to dig him out. However, Wei's breath was faint, and his pulse was weak. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but died within an hour.</p>
<h3>He Gongdu Provides Free Medical Care</h3>
<p>Mr. He Gongdu has been practicing medicine for more than ten years, specializing in typhoid fever, miscellaneous diseases, and pediatrics. He is from Jinshan County. The He family is a prominent family in Jinshan and has a large collection of books. In addition to browsing the books, Mr. He also devoted himself to the study of medicine. However, because he had not been apprenticed to a teacher, he was not satisfied. He admired Yun Tieqiao of Wujin and apprenticed himself to him. He made great progress and returned to practice medicine, saving even more lives. Because Jinshan is unstable, his fellow villagers in Shanghai urged him to stay in Shanghai to help the world and provide free medical care to the poor. It is heard that he has agreed to set up a clinic at No. 1, Wufeng Lane, at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Luban Road in the French Concession. He provides free medical care and medicine every morning, charging only 20 cents per number. Those seeking treatment are constantly arriving.</p>
<h3>Western Paint Association Replies to Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Western Paint Industry Association responded to the Yanghuo Nine Industries Association, stating that it would wait for the Legislative Yuan to draft joint organization regulations before following them and that the current temporary maintenance case was questionable. Yesterday, the association sent a letter to the paint industry, stating: "Regarding your association's reply of June 6th, the affiliated paint industry convened a meeting of the industry on the 4th of the same month to discuss the merger to emphasize the law. It was agreed that this association has already registered with the Industrial and Commercial Association and has informed this association that it is a joint organization of more than one industry. It should wait for the Legislative Yuan to draft joint organization regulations before following them and that the current temporary maintenance case, etc., as your association's reply to the association. Based on this, it is found that a joint organization of more than one industry (more than one industry) refers to a complete and sound organization. In a complete organization, its local organization must also be organized according to the provisions of the Industrial and Commercial Association Law, the Industrial and Commercial Association's Organizational Procedures, and the Reorganization Procedures. If a small number of industry members form an organization that does not comply with current laws and regulations and freely combines into a joint organization under the guise of more than one industry, the organization during the era when the United Association's name was not banned and the competent authority was laissez-faire is also illegal. Moreover, the groups with a (joint) name in this city have long been severely banned by the Municipal Party Department. Your association is a group of more than one industry, so the title is (Yanghuo Nine Industries Association). Even now, changing the name to Yanghuo Commercial Association is roughly not fully in line with current laws and regulations and is changing the name. The tiger skin and sheep quality will eventually be in accordance with the law but will not be legal. The donkey in Guizhou has felt its skills are exhausted, and it is clear that the organization is fragmentary and cannot exist. The letter stated that it should wait for the Legislative Yuan to draft joint organization regulations before following them and that the current temporary maintenance (status quo) is purely a delaying tactic. It is not known that the location of your association belongs to the Special District. According to current laws and regulations, the land jurisdiction and competent authority belong to the Municipal Party Department. Any organization of your association should be guided by the competent authority, which is most appropriate. Your association should be able to understand this meaning without this association having to point it out. Your association is based on the above-mentioned ideal observation, and must want to overthrow all laws and regulations of the current organization of the industry association and regard the laws as straw sandals. May I ask if the Legislative Yuan regards your association's unhealthy joint organization as a special permit treaty, or because of other obstacles, it will not announce this plan and method. Your association may even (temporarily maintain the status quo) to obtain a permanent opportunity, which is questionable. Those who do not know think that your association is cleverly relying on recklessness and wants to create a buffer for the real and pure association, causing social disputes. This kind of lucky chance cannot be reflected under the party flag. This matter concerns the friendship between this association and your association's paint members, and we are on the same boat. We consider the interests of the industry as a whole, not distinguishing between regions and not treating each other as strangers. We work hard to seek the common welfare of the industry. We have submitted your association's answer to the second executive meeting of this association for discussion and resolution. In addition to telegraphing the National Government, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for interpretation and instructions, please forward them to others, etc. The corresponding record case is hereby communicated to you. I hope that your association will check and inform others. This is addressed to the Shanghai Yanghuo Commercial Association."</p>
<h3>Lost Girl Waiting to be Claimed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Municipal Public Security Bureau received Qian Ashun, a lost girl, from the First Sub-station of the Second District. She said that she was ten years old and from Xitangqiao, Zhejiang. She has parents and younger siblings. She now lives in Shanghai, but does not know the address, alley name, or door number. She bought cigarettes and does not know how to return to her address. The child is wearing a white plaid voile jacket, black cocoon silk pants, white socks, and foreign blue cloth shoes. She has been sent to Xin Puyu Tang for temporary care while waiting to be claimed.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 pm yesterday stated that the Shandong coast is clear with winds from no direction. The Jiangsu coast and Shanghai and other places are cloudy with heavy gusts of wind and rain from the southeast. The weather in Zhejiang and the Ma'an Islands is extremely bad because the hurricane has reached east of Fuzhou and is heading northwest. There is another hurricane in the Pacific Ocean west of Guam that will continue to move northwest. The highest temperature in the 24 hours before 3 pm yesterday was 90.3 degrees, and the lowest was 78.0 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 95.2 degrees, and the lowest was 76.8 degrees.</p>

<h3>A Discussion on the Principles of the Court Organization Law by Li Cishan</h3>
<p>The Judicial Yuan of the National Government drafted twelve articles of the principles of the Court Organization Law, which were submitted to the Legislative Yuan for discussion through the Political Council. Li Cishan, a lawyer and chief writer of the Shanghai Law Journal, believes that there are still major omissions in the aforementioned principles. He specially sent a letter to the President and Vice-President of the Legislative Yuan, as well as all members, requesting for remedies. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper, I learned that the Judicial Yuan submitted twelve articles of the principles of the Court Organization Law to your esteemed Yuan through the Political Council. I am delighted to know that the legislative officials have begun to reform the court system. After repeatedly reading the twelve principles, I found that only the following three points have been reformed in substance compared with the old system: (1) Expanding the scope of private prosecution; (2) Implementing a three-level, three-instance system; (3) Adopting a single-judge system in the District Court. The first type of reform was forced by the discussion on abolishing the procuratorial system and is a compromise solution. It may be temporarily accommodated and tried out for a while. The second and third types of reforms are necessary for practical needs, only regretting that the decision was made too late. In the first year of the Republic of China, Anhui and Zhejiang provinces simultaneously implemented a three-level, three-instance system. The Anhui system was created by me, Li Cishan. It consisted of a High Court Division solely responsible for final appeals, eight Local Court Divisions solely responsible for second appeals, and a single-judge Primary Court in each of the sixty counties solely responsible for initial trials. In practice, the High Court Division was a branch of the Supreme Court, the Local Court Division was the High Court, and the Primary Court was the District Court. The Zhejiang system was exactly the same. While the construction was underway, the Beijing government forcibly destroyed it with a unified order. Legal professionals in the two provinces still regret it. The current principles are completely consistent with the spirit of the system in Anhui and Zhejiang provinces at that time. The system we hoped for twenty years ago can only be realized now, and it is unavoidable to feel that it is too late. In addition, after carefully reviewing the entire article, I deeply feel that the reform flavor it contains is too weak. It can only be regarded as a modification of the old system and is not sufficient to be called the construction of a new system. It is not like the measures of a revolutionary government and makes those who aspire to reform the judiciary disappointed. I respectfully, without overstepping my bounds, present its outline to the gentlemen. (1) People's participation in the judiciary is a common practice in all countries in the world. The most conservative Britain is the birthplace of the jury system, needless to say. The German and Austrian states in continental Europe adopted the assessor system outside the jury system long ago. Japan, which inherited the continental law, has implemented the jury system for two years. Even the Soviet Russia, with its proletarian dictatorship, allows people to participate in court trials regardless of party affiliation. Only the Republic of China is applying a judicial system in which officials make decisions arbitrarily. Furthermore, I have examined our country's history books. In the era of the Cheng Zhou dynasty, all death row inmates had to go through three interrogations and three pardons, that is, consulting with the ministers and officials, and asking about the views of the court and the public before imposing the penalty. Mencius said that if the people of the country all say that someone can be killed, then examine him to see if he can be killed, and then kill him. In fact, taking counsel with the common people is the highest principle. The old Court Organization Law copied the defects of Japan before its reform and has long been spurned by those with knowledge. The minimum extent of the current general reform should pay a little attention to the "people's rights" in the Three Principles of the People. Why is there no discussion on this fundamental principle? This is truly bewildering. People in the country have little research on the history and theory of the jury and assessor systems, but whenever it is mentioned, opposing arguments from both the old and new factions are heard. The old faction says, "The level of the people is insufficient. If they are allowed to participate in the judiciary, many evils will arise." The new faction says, "The jury system in Europe and the United States has produced many jokes in the courtroom. Why should our country imitate it?" They do not know that the abolition of a system must take the interests of the entire people for thousands of years as the object of measurement. In particular, the severity of the advantages and disadvantages must be carefully examined to be used as a balance for taking and giving. There is absolutely no system in the world that has only advantages and no disadvantages. It is only necessary to choose the one that has more advantages than disadvantages and more important advantages than minor disadvantages. Researchers of the jury and assessor systems can generally speak to the point that the interests of the people must be asked of the people themselves. The answers obtained are the most accurate. If it is said that the level of the people is insufficient, then administrative and judicial officials, and even legislative members, all come from the people. It is self-deception to say that one person is omnipotent when they are in office, but they are insufficient when they are in the marketplace. (2) The circuit court system is rejected and not adopted, meaning that setting up more branch courts can remedy it, and giving two reasons: 1. Litigation should be handled at any time when it occurs. Delays will be caused when the circuit court has not arrived. 2. Investigation of evidence often cannot be completed immediately. After the trial begins, prolonged stays in the area will distort the true meaning of the circuit court. These two concerns can be said to be completely wrong. The circuit court judge's duty is to carry out public trial procedures. The preparatory procedures before the public trial, such as investigating evidence and summoning the parties, are handled by the local resident government officials. They can proceed leisurely and handle them at any time. Once the circuit court arrives, it will implement public trials on cases that have completed the preparatory procedures, and there will be no delays. This is one point. All cases submitted to the circuit court must be limited to those with serious circumstances. Ordinary trivial cases are naturally handled by the local court at any time and do not need to be submitted to the circuit court. Since the case is serious and involves significant interests, only the fairness of the judgment result is sought, and the speed of the conclusion is not the point of contention. If the current circuit court cannot conclude the case, it can continue to implement preparatory procedures and wait for the next circuit court to conclude it. There will be no prolonged stay or delay. This is the second point. If it is said that setting up more branch courts may not be permitted by the country's economic strength, even if it is possible to establish them, with numerous branch courts at the same level that do not interact with each other, legal opinions will inevitably differ from each other. It is better for circuit judges to come from the same court, where there is an opportunity to exchange opinions, gather and discuss. Moreover, appeals of serious criminal cases involve the expense and delay of prisoner transfers, and civil appeals also involve running back and forth and prolonging the years. The public and private losses in this are immeasurable. If circuit judges preside over the trial, both public and private parties will benefit in terms of time and economy. Moreover, circuit courts have a special benefit that current court systems do not have. The current court judges live in seclusion and are isolated from society. Although they are calm-minded, their common sense is often insufficient, and their observations tend to be erroneous. Circuit courts, on the other hand, allow judges to approach the people during the journey, often having the opportunity to discover the truth of society, which is different from those who live in seclusion. All of these points should be noted by the creators. How can they reject it based on two erroneous concerns? This is truly cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. Furthermore, the District Court has been changed to a single-judge system. No matter how serious the case, it is borne by one single judge. At present, there is a lack of talent. The number of places in the country that have established formal courts is less than five percent. There is still a sigh of difficulty in finding talent. Once courts are universally established, where can so many excellent judges be found? The selection of academic knowledge and experience will inevitably have to be slightly accommodated. If all cases, regardless of severity, are entrusted to these judges who are not very cherishing, then errors and injustices will inevitably be seen frequently, and the congestion of appeals will be seen to overwhelm the High Court. Only by assigning major cases to senior and respected judges of the High Court to preside over the trial, while the preparatory procedures are still the responsibility of the local court, and contributing their opinions to the presiding judges as much as possible, can the prestige of the High Court be enhanced, and the reality of the collegial system can still be achieved in the change to the single-judge system. As for the establishment of branch courts of the District Court, there are many places where it is not necessary to set up resident judges. One judge can patrol several branch courts, and the clerk can be responsible for the preparatory procedures, reducing the number of judges needed, thereby reducing judicial expenses and carefully selecting true legal talents. If one does not act according to reality and merely sings the high tune of universally establishing courts and branch courts, then the promulgation of the new system may be equivalent to the past history of the Court Organization Law, drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. (3) The protection of human rights should be stipulated in the constitution in principle, but the constitution can only outline the main points, and its detailed provisions must be left to the laws. The judicial system takes the protection of human rights as its sole duty. The Anglo-American system of appearance notices and the continental system of unjust imprisonment compensation, which seek pre-event and post-event protection, must be carefully considered and incorporated into the established system to show that our party's government has not forgotten the rights of the people. Otherwise, the governments of Cao Kun and Zhang Zuolin were still able to promote the protection law, and the government of the Three Principles of the People is not paying attention to this, which is surprising. Since the Criminal Procedure Law has been promulgated and implemented, the opportunity to insert protection regulations has passed. Only by establishing regulations in the Court Organization Law can it be done. Otherwise, separate regulations should be enacted and promulgated at the same time as the Court Organization Law to make it perfect. This is the backbone of the judicial system and cannot be ignored. (4) The division of domestic jurisdiction is not something that the courts can unify. The most obvious examples are violations of police regulations that are immediately decided, military trials, and various collection agencies of customs and salt affairs that confiscate property and impose fines, as well as general administrative offices that do not go through the courts. The recent legislative trend is to vigorously expand administrative trials and reduce court trials. The Labor-Management Dispute Resolution Law and the Land Law are all examples of this. If this continues, the courts will become an insignificant institution, and talent and financial resources will decline day by day. The judicial organs will never have the hope of perfection. Only by concentrating all jurisdiction in the courts can all property confiscation and detentions of more than one day and fines of more than one yuan be decided by the courts. Except for warships and combat areas, military courts should be permanently prohibited. Then the judicial expenses will naturally be sufficient, the prestige of the courts will naturally increase, and outstanding talents can also be concentrated in the courts. This is the biggest key to improving the judiciary and should be treated equally with the abolition of consular jurisdiction. (5) Setting the High Court as a collegial system of three people is too lacking in flexibility and is not necessary in fact, and it increases the number of judges accordingly, causing appeals to pile up. The second instance appeals of the High Court in the three-level, three-instance system will inevitably be concentrated here. Minor cases under the jurisdiction of the former primary level can be resolved in a few words, and there is no need for a three-person collegial system. If all cases, regardless of size, are collectively discussed by three people, then major cases will be dealt with lightly, and the increase in the number of personnel and the backlog of cases will be the natural result. Therefore, minor cases may still be handled by a single judge, but major cases are more appropriate for a three-person collegial system. All of these five major points are the omissions of the twelve articles of the principles proposed by the Judicial Yuan. I hope that the gentlemen of your esteemed Yuan, who are loyal, hardworking, and revolutionary, will earnestly remedy them. This is my greatest wish. Anhui Li Cishan kowtows, July 7, 19th year.</p>

<h3>New Turkish Literature</h3>
<p>The Awakening of National Consciousness</p>
<p>The Present and Future of the New Alphabet</p>
<p>Turkish literature does not seem to occupy any position in the world. Therefore, for many years, Chinese readers only knew about Arabian and Persian stories, and no one ever talked about Turkey. The reason for this is not that Turkey has no great writers worth introducing, but that their international status and writing have buried and limited them. Because their writing and language were all old and obscure Arabic characters, and the missionary schools run by imperialists in the country, in addition to religious subjects, prohibited them from reading Arabic except for reading English or French. This naturally caused their national consciousness to decline, fostering docile subjects of imperialism, and their creative power was forever suppressed and exploited. However, after the revolution and after several years of construction, after regaining the right to education, the difficult and uninternationalized Arabic characters were simply abolished, and the Latin alphabet was adopted. The number of illiterate people has decreased by one-tenth from five million.</p>
<p>In the National Party government's vigorous promotion of the European alphabet plan after the revolution, great attention was paid to literature, and booksellers and scholars were strongly supported in the promotion of newspapers and books, with the intention of reconstructing the literature of the new era from the literacy of the people. Because in the past many years, the literary products of Turkey were too few. Only the novelist Reshad Nouri's (The Wren) has been translated into foreign languages, which has been translated into German. That book describes a woman who, with the promise of her fiancé, goes to teach in Anatolia and then returns to her hometown to marry the man. The description of the scenery and environment of the Anatolian countryside is completely in the Turkish local style. Although the facts are very simple, because it does not contain the atmosphere of Persians or Arabs, but contains all the Turkish national color, it has been bought 25,000 copies in four years. In addition to this work, he also has novels (From lip to heart), (The secret hand), (Stain), etc.</p>
<p>(The elimination of Persianization and Arabization in literature is a cause that the Turkish literary world wants to work hard to build. Although the Arabs believe that Turkey cannot build an independent culture and literature, under the rule of Kemal, which takes national consciousness as the center of the revolution, they are constantly working hard to open up new lands. They want to get rid of the oriental color of the countries in Central Asia. The so-called literature is only a category of myths, rumors, and anecdotes produced in the desert wilderness, and to re-embark on the road of literature that mainly describes the course and future of the Turkish revolution. Therefore, the current moment is the dawn of the construction of new Turkish literature. In this effort, the translations of French pastime works, in the eyes of new students, seem to lead them to the point of national decline. We are not sad either, because our past Roman Catholic religious education and the resentment of prohibiting the learning of Turkish should occur after their national consciousness is enlightened.)</p>
<p>This is the criticism of the Turkish literary movement in the annual report published by the French Catholic Church this year. Religious propaganda is naturally hopeless. (The above is translated from the daily newspaper of the World Lutheran Federation of America.)</p>
<p>France carried out cultural aggression against Turkey early on, but the main trend of Soviet literature, which once helped her revolution, has not flowed in, and there is simply no tendency of the Soviet system, politics, or literature in Turkey. Therefore, according to the (New York Herald Tribune), in the Soviet Union's review of Turkey, the so-called (Turkey has broken free from the shackles of imperialism and should not inject national consciousness into literary works... She should not forget the help Russia gave her during the revolution, and in literature, she should naturally abandon the national consciousness of the nomadic era in Central Asia, and in the use of the new alphabet, pour new wine into new skins. Everything can reflect the new path of Turkish literature in the future, which does not belong to the Soviet Union, France, or any European country, and she is working hard to build a literature based on the Turkish national tone.</p>
<p>Therefore, during the transition period between the old and new characters, in order to resolutely ban them, Turkey once destroyed two million Arabic books in Constantinople. Moreover, in the thousands of books printed in the past two years, textbooks accounted for 80%. In children's books, the words are poems and the books are colorful. In the 20%, there are 40 novels, 30 collections of children's stories, and 15 volumes of poetry. Recently published is a book of prose poems (Drop by drop) written by a member of parliament specifically to encourage students, and (Songs and dances of Eastern Anatolia) and (Regular readings), (Turkish folk songs), (Biography of General Kemal) integrated by European travel notes are about to be published. However, the country's readers are still concentrated in the cities, and in addition to students, old-fashioned people who read for recreation are still reluctant to read new-character books. However, the government's strength in promoting new characters has completely reached the people. Women and children find the new language fashionable and interesting. There has been a great change in language. After the publication of the dictionary containing 30,000 new characters, it is expected that the implementation of new characters will inevitably refresh Turkey's Eastern sick man's decadence, and lead her to a bright and smooth path in the future.

<h3>Recent French Literary Scene</h3>
<p>In France, politicians are often writers, and writers are often politicians. The Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau was like this. This is a slightly distant example. What about a closer example? We can cite that new-school French Ambassador to the United States, Paul Claudel.</p>
<h3>Claudel</h3>
<p>is not only a very talented politician, but also one of the three or four greatest living writers in France. In the European literary scene, Claudel is a very important playwright. Recently, he published a new book (The Satin Slipper), which is also a script. It is said that this script is very great and can be regarded as one of the masterpieces of modern times. If you want to compare it with the works of predecessors, there are only Goethe's (Faust) and Dante's (Divine Comedy). The story of this script is a bit complicated, and it is impossible to explain it in a few words. The story takes place in Spain, in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Donna Prouhèse is a beautiful woman, but unfortunately she married an old man. Her husband is an official and has been ordered by the King of Spain to go to Africa to govern the Spanish colony. She is about to go to Africa with her husband, but she is reluctant to leave her lover, because she has fallen in love with Don Rodrigue, and Don Rodrigue also loves her madly. He simply cannot live without her. Therefore, Donna Prouhèse feels that her situation is dangerous, and feels that if no one comes to help her, she will definitely throw herself into her lover's arms. So she put her pair of satin slippers in the hands of a statue of Venus, so that she could be alarmed and alert. Later, the background of the story changed from Spain to the United States, Japan, Africa, (a hot place on the stomach). We see that this pair of men and women have never been separated, and have always loved each other, but they have always suppressed their love and did not let it be expressed, until they gradually approached death. That's how it was. Rodrigue's ending as a slave and a hero is written very magnificently, reminiscent of Velázquez's beggar.</p>
<p>The Bernald Grasset bookstore in Paris recently published a very strange novel, called</p>
<h3>David Golder</h3>
<p>(David Golder), is an English author who is a young woman that no one has ever known, Madame Irene Nemirovsky. When she sent the manuscript to the bookstore, she stated that if it could be used, she would send a letter to notify her, (poste restante), because she did not write out her address. However, the person who read the manuscript in the bookstore was very slow. By the time he sent in the report saying that the manuscript could be adopted, the female writer had been waiting impatiently, and later simply did not go to the post office to pick up her letters. Therefore, the bookstore spent a lot of procedures before finally finding her. This is an amazing work, because it contains a kind of power that is rare in female writers' novels. From a certain point of view, this novel is very similar to Balzac's masterpiece (Pere Goriot), but it is even more tragic because the old banker, the Jew David Golder, finally died for his daughter, but the girl was not his daughter, his wife's lover was her father. Although this novel is too dark and too romantic, it does have many advantages. Its dialogue is very lively and realistic. It can tightly grasp the reader's attention from beginning to end, and give the reader a solemn and beautiful, hymn-like impression.</p>
<h3>Culeandra</h3>
<p>(Culeandra) is a French translated novel that is well worth paying attention to. This is a Romanian work that has just been translated into French. The original author, Redreanu, is one of the best novelists in Romania. His (Culeandra) tells the story of the son of a very powerful politician who kills his wife. Therefore, his father, in order to save him from the shame of imprisonment, sends him to an asylum to be confined. But he did not expect that after he entered the asylum, he went crazy and became a real madman. The theme of this novel is terrible, but the narrative is characterized by strong and simple.</p>

<h3>Explanation of Starting a Children's Drama Society</h3>
<p>By Tang Xueyong</p>
<p>In recent decades, the enthusiasm of Chinese friends engaged in literature and art for the reform of drama cannot be said to be lacking. Apart from the improvement of old operas themselves, there has also been the establishment of "civilized drama," new plays, and so on. However, most of the initial efforts were made by people in the drama world. It was not until the New Culture Movement era that a large number of literary giants also engaged in this movement, either introducing, creating, or criticizing scripts in various ways, which was truly lively. However, in this high tide of enthusiasm, everyone has forgotten one important thing: the basic skills of actors in music and performance, as well as the specialized education of orchestra musicians. In European and American countries, these responsibilities are borne by their respective national public or private large music academies. If we really want to establish a modern-style opera house in our country, where can we find talents in singing, playing, and performing? Frankly speaking, I'm afraid it's more reliable and convenient for our Children's Drama Society to cultivate them ourselves. Therefore, our intention in starting the Children's Drama Society is simply to create a children's opera troupe. A children's opera troupe is by no means child's play; it has existed before, in what was called "baby classes." However, there are differences in education and artistic content in terms of refinement and simplicity. Even in terms of baby classes, they have already had considerable achievements to show everyone. Our future children's opera troupe will be created by the Children's Drama Society using more advanced and confident modern music professional education. Therefore, if China truly wants to perform grand operas worthy of the world's stage, we can only ask everyone to support our "baby class," especially our Children's Drama Society.</p>
<p>Here, we want to solemnly state a few words to everyone: We do not believe that there is such a thing as quick success in the world, nor will there be good results without labor. Therefore, it is too simplistic to hope that our future children's troupe will be successful in a month, and we dare not be too confident even if we think they will be successful in three years. However, one thing we dare to believe is that there is not a single outstanding musician or a brilliant performer throughout history and around the world who did not come from our young children. Sometimes, amazing musical prodigies simply emerge from our children's teams. This is what is commonly known as a "child prodigy." The reason is very simple. For example, the necessary conditions for a musician are good eyesight, acute hearing, a sensitive mind, and nimble hands. Honestly, only our children have the potential to achieve these. No matter how dedicated you are as an adult, there is simply not much hope. This is also the reason why we want to start a Children's Drama Society.</p>
<p>Now, I want to talk about our methods for the Children's Drama Society. Speaking of methods, it is even simpler. For the time being, we do not need a grand society building, nor do we need thousands upon thousands of national currency. Tuition fees are not charged, nor are book fees required. We simply want to invite a group of persistent and ambitious children. Regardless of which school they are in, we will borrow a classroom of adequate size and good air quality. We will first start with courses that all musicians must take, such as common music knowledge, reading music, memorizing notes, and vocal training. When the time is right, we will hold a public examination to select a group of children with more musical talent and cultivate them in various categories and types. All instructors will be selected and hired from Europe and America, employing first- and second-class professors to take on the responsibilities. When I say this, some people will definitely shout, "Nonsense! Isn't this going to completely ruin our nation and completely Europeanize our future artists? This method is simply a tool of cultural invaders!" Then I will straighten my face, puff out my chest, and respond by saying, "Hold on! We absolutely must invite Western professors, but only to help our children take shortcuts to seek knowledge and ability, nothing else. We believe that no matter what you do, the more cleverly you want to use it, the more you must fully understand the thing itself before you can do it well. And the things that come out of it will be presentable. This is true for physics, chemistry, and why not for art? For example, a painter must first know the structure and proportions of the human body, the shapes of still life objects, and the various postures of animals before he can wield the brush freely and vividly. Another example is that a composer must first know the principles of harmony, the coordination of tones, and the arrangement of timbres of various instruments before he can be confident and wield them appropriately. Therefore, what we hope from those Western professors is only to instill basic musical knowledge and skills so that our group of children can spontaneously create and innovate. And all that those professors can do is only this. To say that they can ruin our national character and Westernize our future artists—not to mention those bookworms (because Western professors only know how to teach and don't know how to use students to collude with colleagues to disrupt school affairs and control their jobs)—no one has such great ability. You only need to look at Japan in the past. They followed the West in everything, truly copying everything exactly. However, everyone can tell at a glance that all their products are Oriental goods and not Western goods. We can tell as soon as we hear their music that it is Oriental. Therefore, their imitation of the West only served to promote their national character and did not ruin it. This can probably be reassuring."</p>
<p>At this point, someone will definitely say, "If that's the case, then why not simply send these children to study in the West directly? Wouldn't that be better?" Then I would nod repeatedly and respond respectfully, "Indeed, indeed. As long as the families of these children can all be open-minded and let these children sail across the ocean in a mighty manner, and as long as these children can still remain true to their original aspirations when they finish their studies, not wanting to be extravagant, willing to gather together to build music for society, share joy with everyone, and bring joy to the world, and as long as there is a wise government and generous rich people willing to raise funds so that those children can study abroad with peace of mind, without constantly suffering from economic hardship, and can complete their studies in one go, if there are solutions to all of these, then I will immediately fall to the ground and be the first to agree. If everyone still has some doubts about the above issues, then please simply support our Children's Drama Society, because we believe that inviting a dozen teachers from the West to help us train hundreds of students is ultimately more economical than sending hundreds of students to study in the West. In fact, it is less difficult, and there is relatively more certainty that they will still gather together to work when they finish their studies. Therefore, while I fundamentally agree with sending children abroad to study music in batches, I believe that our Children's Drama Society also has its own considerable necessity. We have now explained the intention of starting this society, and we have also answered the misunderstandings that everyone may have. We only hope that everyone will enthusiastically support us so that this society can sail smoothly to success. It cannot be said to be an unimportant matter for society."</p>
<h3>New York City Has 2,000 Disabled Beggars</h3>
<p>Each Person Can Get Fourteen Gold Yuan Per Day</p>
<p>One Glimpse of the Strange Phenomenon in the Golden Country</p>
<p>Shi Jufen, a graduate of Jinde Girls' High School (photographed by Ruo Bing)</p>
<p>New York News According to a survey released by the New York Happiness Association, there are 2,000 beggars in New York City who earn a total of about 10 million gold yuan each year. Divided per person, each person earns 14 gold yuan per day. According to the report, most of the average beggars are disabled or blind, which is why they can more easily arouse the compassion of passers-by. Also, local patrol officer Teng Siyu said that disabled people can earn huge sums of money. The police authorities arrest a disabled beggar and fine him fifty or even one hundred yuan, which is not a big deal. However, arresting and fining him is of no benefit, because once he is released from prison, he will use new efforts to resume this begging business. The Happiness Association, in view of the increasing number of professional beggars, has begun a movement to eliminate this bad practice.</p>

<p>Mr. Yun Zuocheng from Beiping has been teaching Mandarin at St. John's University and various schools in Shanghai for many years. His pronunciation is accurate, his teaching methods are excellent, and his results are rapid. His students are all over the country. Now, because the Ministry of Education is promoting phonetic symbols and advocating Mandarin, Mr. Yun's friends believe that the summer vacation is a good time for all walks of life to learn Mandarin. They encouraged Mr. Yun to establish a Mandarin Morning and Evening School for the summer vacation. Mr. Yun, in response to the requests of his friends, established the school at 1584 Taoyuanfang, North Jiangxi Road. It opened on July 10th. It accepts both men and women. Those who wish to study can enroll at any time.</p>
