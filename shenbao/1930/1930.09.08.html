<p>▲需要工友目的</p>
<p>近來我常常有參觀工廠的機會，歡喜和工廠中的工友們談談，有好多的工友，都是說：（我們出了血汗，竭力做工，固然很辛苦，可是這種苦那裏及得到經理先生的百分之一千分之一呢？）這是一種論調。還聽得二個工友談天，一個說：（天天坐汽車，喫大菜，住洋房，做經理的多麽有趣？）一個搖頭說：（有趣嗎？那有這回事，你要知道他們坐汽車，不是寫意，是縮短時間，是犧牲他的休息工夫，他何嘗是願坐？喫大菜，是最没有滋味的，可是他們爲營業，和種種有關係的事情，實有不得不吃的苦衷，何嘗是願喫？···）這幾句話，都出自工友們之口，可敬哉此工友也。可是工廠當局所希望於我工友的，是什麽？並没有其他奢願，只希望工友們不但用勞力，還須用思想，不但顧到自已，還須顧到全局。你出的血汗愈多，便是替人們開的出路愈廣。在勞苦煩悶時候，不要憤慨，須要明白你們有勉强的生活可過，已是無上幸福。現在你固然辛苦了。還要請你想到無業的和失業的更苦到怎樣？</p>

<h3 id="c17">土耳其之新黨 <a href="#c17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>土耳其自革命以後。能戰勝外交。並無内亂。人多稱道之。以爲土國之革命。殊足效法也。惟近時以來。因驅逐反對者於邊境。而致與波斯起交涉。今又因新黨領袖費塞之返國。而致起歡迎者與警察間之衝突。此其起因。於今日視之雖亦不甚重大。然而土國内部之爭。或將因是而起乎。此誠非可以等閑視之者也。</p>
<p>土國之所以建立此新黨爲欲解决土國之經濟與財政之困難也。方今世界各國之經濟與財政。受世界商業全部不振之影響。幾於無一國不困難也。方今世界國之新政黨。是否能解土國之經濟與財政之困難。漊屬疑問。而經此新政黨與政府之間一衝突。兩方之政見。已立於不相容之地位。而其日後之進行。必至互相水火。日益加甚。其結果且將演劇烈之内爭。是土耳其革命後。順利之進行中。至於今日而將遇阻碍也。甚矣欲建立一新興强盛國之非易事也。</p>

<p>— 顏也</p>
<p>今日之扶桑三島。已爲世界文明國之一矣。然其社會上重男輕女之惡習。則視我猶過之無不及。近有久居日本之友人歸來。爲道彼邦男女不平等事綦夥。錄其一二。以告讀者。</p>
<p>日本之小學敎師。男子之數恒多於女子。以東京論。同爲第一年服務之師範畢業生。男子月薪爲五十五元。女子則僅得四十五元。同一資格。同一能力。推之其職務同。努力同。而待遇之不平若斯。其重男輕女。彰彰明矣。至師範生在校求學時。其所獲津貼。亦女少於男。蓋女僅月得十二元九角。男則有十三元五角也。</p>

<p>年來青年自殺之事。日有所聞。縱爲環境壓迫所致。亦青年不知奮鬥之恥也。自由談前載天虚我生及某君之生活解决方法。用心甚佳。蓋生活之困難。多爲自殺之主因也。須知人生斯世。風俗澆薄。生活高而謀事難。强者流爲盜匪。弱者厭世頽唐。其所趨皆自殺之途也。其或意志薄弱。頽廢浪漫。結果以一死自了。又或失業已久。家累彌重。呼籲無門。告貸無路。遂出於自殺之一途。又或情塲失意。學府潦倒。沈　頽廢文學。醉心詖辭邪說。皆爲自殺之副因也。旣抉其因。可明補救之道。夫社會經濟程度日高。爲世界潮流之所趨。實爲無辦法之事。若社會之侈奢淫靡。此惡潮流之浸漸。苟能意志鞏固。自無有衝激之虞。譬如常讀香艶小說。一旦改讀秦漢文字。古茂典麗。必覺香艶小說爲淺陋不堪卒讀矣。故人唯求新。吾唯求舊。此中大有樂趣。社會潮流縱惡。初不受絲毫之影響也。至於生活之困難。則勤以開源。儉以節流。學以求業。誠以立身。世變縱亟。不易吾言。亦何至爲自殺之舉哉。老子曰。我有大患。惟我有身。我若無身。我則何患。山谷老人曰。衆生身同太虚。煩惱何處安脚。夫旣身同太虚。而視身若無。則憂患得失。自不能入。戀愛金錢。益無關於我身矣。夫人生眞諦。大則有裨於國家。小則有益於社會。上者立德。次則立功。又次立言。本奮鬥之精神。抱樂觀之態度。世界怪傑拿破侖曰。（難）字唯愚人字典中有之（科南達利曰。（人生前進耳。後顧奚爲。）此皆青年所當奉爲圭臬者也。嗟夫。今日亂離之世也。吾不願青年之學信陵醇酒婦人。又源願學晉人之猖狂妄行。無已。其學淵明、堯夫乎。它若頽廢小說之禁止。節制生育之提倡。正軌人生觀之宣傳。皆爲挽救要策。有心世道者所急宜注意者也。嗚呼。自殺、懦者之行爲也。大好青年。其速勉旃。</p>

<h3 id="c95">戰後波蘭之内政（一） <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 黎六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>波蘭復國。亦旣十稔。自其表面觀之。現在全國兩千八百餘萬人同在一共和旗幟之下。其國家似已完全統一矣。然一逕考察。則知其内政方面尚未全部一致。取一最小之事證之。波人之欲得身分證明書者。因其出生地點不同而手續各異。有須由市長發給誕生證者。有須由牧師出具受洗證者。東部與西部之情形逈殊。</p>
<p>但吾人苟一思及波蘭之眞正獨立僅始自一九一八年。則此紛異之情形並不足怪。波蘭亡國凡百二十四年。處俄德奥三大强國宰割之下。其固有文化摧殘殆盡。瓜分結果。精神方面與物質方面在三種不同之環境中潛移默化。使波蘭形成三個不同之邦。而失去其同一祖國之種種共通點矣。大戰之初。德奥兩國政府同命未來之皮爾蘇得斯基元帥（Ｐilsudski）組織波蘭獨立軍爲德奥之助。而别方面又有無數波蘭兵士加入俄軍作戰。受大公爵尼古拉之指揮。蓋尼古拉亦許波蘭自治也。俄軍退後。德軍占領波蘭全境。使波蘭表面呈統一之象。一九一六年德人爲使波蘭加盟作戰起見。且許波人慶祝其固有之國慶。承認波蘭獨立。但此獨立直至大戰終了時止。不過徒有其名而已。波蘭之獲得眞正自由。實自休戰之日始。以前波人爲謀祖國獨立故。或加入聯盟軍以攻協約。或加入協約或加入協約軍以攻聯盟。自相殘殺。一任命運支配。至此時始達到其共同目的。圑結爲一。完成波蘭之獨立。</p>
<p>當此時也。波蘭内政一切均在萌芽時代。波蘭民軍乃波蘭軍隊之萌芽。發梭微（Varsorie）市衛軍乃波蘭警察之萌芽。一九一七年成立之執政會乃波蘭政府之萌芽。（此執政會於一九一八年十一月十四日將政權移交皮爾蘇得斯基元帥）此時新波蘭之組織不過如此。而對内須與饑饉盜賊以及種種因亡及戰爭而起之災難爲戰。對外則國境尙未劃定。須防禦强鄰侵占。其責任之重。實遠過於其力之所能勝。</p>

<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>游梵爾賽宮（七）Versailles</p>
<p>現代歐洲的藝壇。一輩惡魔主義Ｄiabolism的畫家。他們也是要描寫一切黑暗面。以表示惡魔的興感的。這些都没有什麽怪異。他們也不過是要徹到人間味的底裏去的人。猶如講究殽饌的人。是都愛吃異味的東西的。—如中國人之愛吃臭腐乳。變蛋。酸辣菜。日本人之愛吃澤庵潰物。西洋人之愛吃牛酪—假使不能賞識那種異味的人。是没有談論中國。日本。或西們一路從梵爾賽宮苑向外面跑。我一路就是這樣嚕嚕不斷地和陳君講—。走出梵宮後面大廣塲的時候。空中的雲是被風刮散了。一條長虹從左面屋頂升起一直到右邊樹叢中落下。正成一個一百八十度的孤形。它那絢爛多變的色調。使得我們驚訝。迷惑。呵。這是我們的榮光。那一瞬間幻滅的榮光。</p>
<p>游過梵爾賽宮以後。自已常常想。那樣宏大博異的苑囿。那樣瓌麗莊嚴的皇宮。非有天才而抱享樂主義的君主是不能做到的。非是（朕即國家）的專制君權是不能做到的。是的。路易十四。路易十五的時代。法國的政治已經到君權大盛的時候。專制威燄正是炙手可熱之時。那時宮廷生活的奢豪。也足以使我們驚歎的。</p>
<p>單是給事宮殿有四千人。瑞士護兵守門衛兵九千零五人。—當時法國宮廷的守衛都是瑞士人。因爲瑞士人忠誠不二之故。—王族家從二千餘人。總共一萬六千人。歲費二千萬。宮女飮食一年支八百萬。若不時之賞。中飽所得。則宮官俸入百數十。實得數千。宮女繁多。皆無職事。日事榮飾而已。御廚每年費一百四十六萬。膳夫二百九十五人。膳長歲入三萬四千。而酒費一項亦四百萬。魚鳥費四十萬。宮馬四千。輿輅二百二十。鑾衛壯丁一千五百人禦三百萬。俳優圉御牧犬。都住於宮旁。環繞近畿一百二十里是獵塲。嚴禁人民出入。王與貴族。及時畋獵兎豕麋鹿無算。歲費四十八萬。從一七五五年到一七六九年。凡十四年之中。獵豕之役一百四十四次。射鹿之役一百三十一次。獮羊兎之役二百六十六次。獮禽之役二十五次。每設五日或三日。别有離宮十二。歲費一百餘萬。修繕費八十餘萬。王每畋獵行幸。上自貴族宮人。下至侍從牧圉盡室從游。每一日接從人之費。就須十萬。王十四年中除游獵外。巡游二百三十四次。王所私入歲二萬萬。王妃一指環値三百萬。近侍歲俸一千三百萬。這樣奢汰。至於吾國的帝王史上一頁一頁翻過去。只有隋煬帝唐明皇才可與之比擬咧。</p>
<p>路易十四的確是一個有天才的君主。他不担是個人的享樂主義。他從享樂中收攬大權。日爲削封建抑滅貴族之策。收拾封建爲關内侯之虚爵。特盛飾宮苑侈畋獵聲色游娛。因而大集諸侯於闕下。長夜爲歡。以清談爲高。以任職爲鄙。隱隱地銷失他們據土抗令的雄心。是無異一舉而滅十萬侯國。實行其君權之統一。而演出法蘭西君權全盛時代的榮華。可是。封建的隱患已消。而人民之疾苦未解。那時貴族們正把人民視如草芥。踐之蹈之而絶不動容。煎民膏。吸民血。專制的壓迫也正到了極點了。不過專制的壓力。儘可以摧殘一般普通人的思想。而决不能阻止思想家的反抗。因此當時法國就出了一羣大思想家。而爲反抗這種專制政治的。而爲反抗這種專制政治的原動力。以造成後來法國的大革命。</p>

<p>棉市大勢情形尙屬衰弱不振、蓋以海外棉市仍難樂觀故在週初賣戶極踴、查往年在新花上場之前、日商有大量抛購遠期新棉儲藏、猶今庚因世界原料均有過剩、印度棉價極廉、各廠儘量吸飽據云足數需用五六個月本廠亦然有此巨量囤積、且新棉價高、當然無採辦之必要、因此新棉交易之清、爲歷來所罕見故廠商大部份觀低、未幾天氣不正、陰晴不定、於是買方乘機購進加碼、一般棉商議論紛紜、一時形勢有猛力之漲風、然世界情形仍陷悲境　新買者仍缺乏、市盤又跌、此次陰雨數日、當然損害、幸雨水未久、風勢亦無、據云漢埠損傷尙輕、而週末市氣驟挻、因美棉週訉有看之意、預料二次估計生產减退、瑞大大戶扒空包額殊巨、市勢愈緊　一日間漲起四五錢、美棉物價已達最低程度、爲十年間新低價、然銷費一時尙難激起、前途尙屬疑問、本棉看好極多　然各廠需求不動、加之紗市不振、交易所漢標價因天時不佳、各月比上週均漲三四錢、全週成交統計二十二萬三千七百擔美棉比前週漲十四磅音、市上現棉生意頗清、各廠買進九千三百六十擔、行號進姚花四千○八十擔、姚花來六千六百四十六包、茲將各廠商及號家買去之包額分誌於後、</p>

<p>閘北　昨内地來源十餘號、市上銷化趨滯、河下存貨計三十餘號、北帮破粳買氣尙可、高貨價勉守原盤、中關均疲一兩角之譜、普通大盤在念元零七角左右、按上市自天晴後人心漸看下游、緣四鄉新稻即將收刈登塲、往後來源漸可見旺、因此貨客脫意立股、市氣遂呈欠佳、東新粳到頭陸續、各廠銷意較濃、行情回小半元、祗開十八元之譜、薄稻形勢平淡、抵滬之貨極微、價格標準與粳情相彷、大勢亦屬平疲、新客尖來源本濃、况此貨成本極廉、據最近電訉、划申亦不過十三元零、故此次販運客商之獲利不亞於今春洋米、故昨市一經趨軟、立短兩三角、頂貨祗在十四元許、中段等貨評别批降尤足、市况行將步鬆、至於新參尖等時有時無、雖已見新、然尙難接、可到零星、各貨價格悉隨洋米及粳市客尖而縳移、白元買胃見滯、酒飯兩胃又告觀望、大盤無甚榮辱、祗中次微短角左、</p>
<p>滬南　昨市河到不多、本街進胃各異、常帮頂粳旣缺而乏到故偶有零星到貨、銷塲極佳、情况遂呈俏俐、但蘇同等普通宿次等粳竟問津極少、來源雖薄、究因天宮轉晴、人心大軟、市盤故短兩角左右、東新粳與南路早色新粳價疲兩三角、行情自十七元半至十八元、薄稻產地存貨價批出售、緣新貨行將旺到、故賣氣暢爽、價亦趨疲鉁半、但此貨邇來滬埠不多、大多數來源尙在途中、故猛削尙須稍待、通變陰元到稀銷淡、交易無幾　情勢平淡之格、</p>

<p>明日（九日）爲本黨總理第一次起義紀念、上海特别市黨部、事前積極籌備、特定於是日上午九時、召集各界民衆、舉行紀念大會、各級黨部·各機關·各圑體、均須推派代表四人、前往參加、各情已誌本報、大會地點、本定於小西門少年宣講圑、現改在民國路共和影戲院内舉行、並發表全體同志書云、卅六年前的今日、總理所領導的革命黨、在廣州首次起義革命同志、犧牲流血有七十餘人之多、多年慘澹經營的革命計劃、雖然經這次的失敗、而完全洩露、可是這一次空前未有之偉舉、却傳佈到中外各國、震動了麻木不仁的中華民族、喚醒了熟睡酣夢的全國民</p>
<h3 id="c119">紀念（九九）應有的認識和努力 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>一·公歷一八九四年即清光緒二十年秋、中日戰起清兵屢敗、海軍盡熸　屏藩全失　京津岌岌可危、人心憤激已極、總理不忍民族之危亡人民之塗炭、即偕鄧蔭南等三五同志　由海外回抵香港　翌年春即成立興中會、進行襲取廣州　以爲革命之根據地、定於九月九日發難、不意事機洩漏、槍械被廣州海關抄獲、爲革而第一次犧牲之陸皓東·丘四·朱貴全·遂死之　總理不得已　偕鄭士良走日本、此爲總理第一次起義</p>
<p>二·總理第一次起義　於民族政治社會各方面都有極重大之意義蓋三民主義之革命胚胎、即隨此次起義而日漸發育也、民族方面、總理目擊清政府之腐敗·民族之困危·復感先進國家之振發興盛　知非努力民族運動　無以救中國之危亡、民權方面、痛恨全國人民　内受專制之壓迫外受列强之蹂躪　知非推翻昏聵專制之滿清政府、决不能刷新政治、發揚民權、民生方面、帝國主義者　挾其政治上之優越勢力作經濟上侵略之後盾中國農業經濟破壞殆盡、清政府僅知壓迫人民、不知謀補救之道、故非將此昏庸腐敗之政府推翻、民生問題斷難解决、是總理第一次起義已包含民族民權民生三大革命之精神矣、</p>
<p>三·根據上述我們紀念總理第一次起義、（一）要認識總理第一次起義、是中國民族、發揚民族精神、恢復民族自由挽救民族淪亡之第一次的奮起、（二）要認識總理第一次起義是國民革命的開始不是封建社會英雄豪傑（取而代之）的一種爭奪、在中國歷史上闢一新紀元（三）要認識總理第一次起義、是爲拯救人民於水火、不忍坐視人民生計斷絶而奮起之偉大革命、</p>
<p>四·紀念總理第一次起義　我們應有之努力、（一）要打倒帝國主義廢除不平等條約、因總理第一次起義、是爲帝國主義者之侵略與壓迫、而帝國主義者之所以能侵略與壓迫我民族者　藉不平等條約以爲護符也（二）要肅清封建餘孽努力革命建設、蓋自滿清推翻後國内軍閥、爭攘不已、政治之腐敗、民生之憔悴、較滿清時代爲尤甚十五年本黨出師北伐、賴將士之努力、民衆之擁護　不三年而統一全國不意新舊軍閥、又先後叛亂、桂系唐逆甫告削平閻馮汪逆又互相勾結揭亂北平並勾結共匪蹂躪湘贛、茶毒人民、所以我們紀念總理第一次起義應繼續總理第一次起義的革命精神·擁護中央協助討逆、澈底殲滅　馮汪等反革命勢力永固和平統一之基礎寔現總理救國救民之遺志</p>
<p>標語口號　（一）紀念（九九）要遵守總理遺敎（二）紀念（九九）、要打倒帝國主義、（三）紀念（九九）要廢除一切不平等條約、（四）紀念（九九）、要努力訓政·伸張民權·鞏固民治基礎（五）紀念（九九）、要促成統一、發展生產　解决民生問題、（六）打倒叛黨禍國殃民的　馮汪諸逆、（七）打倒共產黨改組派西山會議派、（八）國民革命成功萬歲、（九）中國國民黨萬歲（十）中華民國萬歲</p>
<p>中國國民黨上海特别市黨部宣傳部衆、在中國革命的歷史上、開了一個新紀元、我們把這件事的前因後果、加以分析、來向同志們作一個簡單的報告、自從近代產業革命政潮劇變的結果、殘暴的帝國主義、遂由歐洲向全世界舒　展出侵略鐵腕來、重大的事實、如非洲的瓜分、澳洲的佔領、印度的滅亡瑘及南部亞洲諸小國和南洋羣島的呑併、全世界歐洲白種以外、有色人種的國家、除日本因維新而得免危亡、其他没有一國不漸趨於衰弱或消亡的、中國在這一個運會裏面、國内政治的庸懦、與滿清的苛暴、已爲人民所不能堪、而經濟上政治上、又受帝國主義列强之宰割、加之日本在自强以後、亦尾隨歐洲列强、而向亞洲大陸進攻、中華民族、在此四面包圍高奛之下、一天一天瀕於危亡絶境、可是國家的現象固然如此隵</p>
<p>在朝者仍復昏瞶愚昧、抱着（寗送友邦不給家奴）的態度、而一般民衆、也仍舊處在雙重壓迫之下、連呻吟的呼聲、都不敢出諸於口、當時總理孫中山先生、處此數千年遺留下的農業封建社會、同時也是一個酷愛和平弱於反抗的民族社會當中、每天所聽到的是（崇拜帝王）（尊敬神聖）的口號、不僅不容易激起革命的怒濤、而且不容易引起革命的情緒、然而總理總想在這渾噩的社會裏、不顧一切高壓和威嚇、不顧一切非議和譏駡、竟喊出（推翻專制曢（建立共和）的口號、來鼓吹革命、不惟鼓吹革命、而竟至實行革命、發世人所未曾發、幹世人所不能幹的事業、於是乎造成轟轟烈烈第一次起義的偉舉、雖然這一次的事情、因爲運械事洩而失敗了、但是革命的潮流、從此便汹湧怒發、不可抑制、史堅如的轟炸兩廣督署、黄克强的湘南起事、徐錫麟秋瑾的起義於長江、以及惠州潮州廣州黄花崗欽廉鎭南關小思河口諸役、至於辛亥革命的成功、前仆後繼、再接再厲、推原溯往、都是總理第一次起義的精神所感召、如果没有總理第一次起義的事實、决没有接二連三繼續不斷的革命運動、更談不到辛亥的成功、即如本黨之得有今日、亦未始非第一次起義之有以促成、同志們、我們可以知道總理不是富翁、他没有金錢、不是藩鎭、他没有人馬和槍械、他所有的祇是强毅果敢、百折不撓的精神、慈祥博大、無所不包的人格、因第一次起義、而犧牲生命的諸烈士、如陸皓東·朱貴金·丘四等七十餘同志、他們有的是犧牲自我效忠主義的壯烈革命行爲、我們絶對承認總理的第一次起義、是中國民族發揚民族精神、恢復民族自由、挽救民族淪亡的第一次奮起、總理的第一次起義、發揚民權、改造政治的革命運動、總理的第一次起義、是爲不忍坐視人民生計斷絶、而欲於未具資本主義雛形的中國社會之下、來解决經濟問題、使達到人數保養無缺的革命方策、現在總理已經逝世了、由第一次起義、而遺留下來的中華民國、因爲國内軍閥的爭攘、政治腐敗、民生憔悴、更比滿清時代爲尤甚、十五本黨繼承總理遺志、興師北伐、三年以來、統一了中國、可是舊軍閥雖然崩潰、新軍閥先後謀叛、唐桂馮閻、相繼稱兵、自名爲總理的信徒反覆無常的僞君子汪精衛、因爲要發展個人領神慾支配慾起見、不惜（出賣人格）（認賊作父）、現在竟脚步踉蹌的投靠到山西土皇帝閻錫山門下去、（搖尾乞憐）（恭聆聖訓）、並且凑合了一般無聊政客、失意官僚、和破壞本黨黨紀的西山會議份子、勾結共黨貪婪失節的改組派、開了一個（善後會議）式的擴大會議、希圖顚覆本黨的法統、又復唆使共匪蹂躪湘贛、危唐黨國、荼毒人民、種種罪惡、已難筆述、至於汪逆精衛、過去反叛黨國的事實、本已十分荒謬、同志們、對於他的認識、都很清楚了、因爲他會花言巧語、期名盜世、以致一般意志較爲薄弱的青年、無形中受了他的麻醉、還以爲他是爲目的而不擇手段、情曲心苦、應予諒解、其不知翻開汪逆這一次到北平所放的厥詞來看、他所說的（什麽政治主合議）、（黨務主公字）、什麽（促開國民會議）、（民衆運動應以援助地方自治爲目標）、（取消訓政時期以黨治國的口號）、承認（其他政黨之政治結社）等、其荒謬絶倫、無以復加、在汪逆因爲要獻媚軍閥、固不足論、但是我們追念到總理四十餘年革命奮鬥的歷史、諄諄勸勉全黨同志的全部遺敎、尤其是在今天第一次起義的紀念黨中、我們縱欲曲予諒解、也不可得、共產黨覆亡本黨、先要亡我黨的歷史、他們曾經說、（十三年以前所流之血、）（皆爲獸血、）其侮辱本黨已到極點、但是汪逆復從而和之、他說、（十三年以前之黨人、皆非革命黨、）這種喪心病狂的話、他侮辱總理·侮辱先烈·已不容誅、我們在第一次起義的當中、追念到爲黨犧牲的先烈、陸皓東·朱貴全·丘四諸先生、我們應該如何切體他們殺身成仁、效忠黨國的精神、來擁護中央、領導民衆、去向叛背黨國侮誣先烈的汪逆精衛宣戰、同志們、國民革命已到了新的時期、同時也是最嚴重的時期了、因爲恐怕革命的成功、無處容身的反動勢力、正在作最後的掙　、帝國主義者、也想乘隙來犯、我們紀念總理第一次起義、應該深體總理的意志、要肅清封建餘孽、努力革命建設、廢除不平等條約、打倒帝國主義、以永固和平統一的基礎、實現總理救國救民的遺志、</p>

<p>保衛圑裏頭、有圑正·圑副·有隊長·排長·班長·似乎階級分了很多、可是保衛圑是民衆組織了武裝圑體、來保衛他自已的地方、所以階級儘管分、圑正與圑員、就與家人父子無異、我是整理委員會常務委員、也就是保衛圑圑員之一、所以在階級一方面講、是個長官、而在圑體一方面講、就等於一家人談話、所以我相信今天的話、是很親愛的、很懇切的、諸位聽了我的話、能照我的話做去、大約總不會有錯的、保衛圑何以要改編要點騐呢、何以往日不改編不點騐現在要改編要點騐呢、這裏頭並不是没有道理、從前南市保衛圑呌做第一圑、北市呌做第二圑、浦東呌做第三支圑、其餘各鄉區也有呌做圑、也有呌做支圑、再把一隊來說、也有我的、也有少的、多的多至三百餘名、少的少至二三十名、究竟憑什麽順序、南市應該爲第一、北市應該爲第二、又憑什麽標準、某區應該爲圑、某區應該爲支圑、隊之編制、古今中外、雖各有不同、可是絶没有三百餘名之多、與二三十名之少、究竟按什麽情形、相差到這魔载遠、簡括說一句話、是各自爲政、毫無組織、整委會負了整理的使命、自然對於編制是很注重的、所以經過了會議、派了委員、親到各鄉區去調查、會同了地方人士、交換意見、斟酌情形、定下了一個標準表、呈報市政府、市政府又經了一番詳細考慮、然後纔連同各區圑經費、一齊核定、頒發下來、現在規定一隊名額是一百零八名、南市保衛圑由十二隊改編爲九隊、只要屈指一算就知道南市圑員是九百七十二名推而至北市、於各鄉區、祇要知道他有多少隊、便知道他圑員有多少名、這就是要改編與要點騐的理由、在諸位九百七十二人中、無論是那一位、都是負有保衛地方責任的一份子那得就得明白保衛圑的意義貫澈保衛圑的主張當了保衛圑圑員、是爲地方服務的、換一句話說、地方的人民、就靠我們保衛圑來保護他、我們的責任、是何等大、我們的名譽、是何等光榮、我們的人格、是何等高尙、我們在總理三民主義、守望相助的遺訓、指導之下、革命尙未成功的過程中尤其是上海地方、五方雜處、良莠不齊、各種反動份子、什魔载共產黨·綁票匪·暗偷·明刦·無所不有、稍一不愼、都可以擾亂地方的安寗、我們對於這等人類蟊賊、就得用力來剷除他、我們對於自已保衛的地方、就得用全力來防範這不良份子的蠢動、使得在我們被保衛區域内的人民、都能享受安樂、不受損失、不起恐慌、那麽保衛圑三個字、纔呌做響噹噹、主不是諸位投身到保衛圑來當了一個圑員、也可以名副其實、再講起來、上海地方、向來氢軍警圑三字相提並論、軍隊是對於外的、警察是維持公安的、獨有我們的保衛圑、他的任務、雖然應該協助軍警、可是他的性質、是與商圑無異、完全爲保護自已的、政府對於我們、還要派人員、撥經費、來替吾們管理·整頓、那麽我們圑員、就盡些義務、吃的基、也就不算什麽、所以當圑員的、一、要絶對服從命令、二、要切實保衛地方、三、要遵守紀律、四、要認清職責、五、要加緊訓練、以上五點、諸位要是没有做到、就趕緊向這條途徑上去、要是已經做到、還得努力奮鬥、到底不懈、我今天所訓勉的在此、所希望的也就在此、完了、</p>

<h3 id="c174">東報之對華貿易觀 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>全國豐收貿易根本條件已備　尤望内戰早結促進經濟活動</p>
<p>大阪朝日新聞論文云、中國之對外貿易、常於下半年達於最高潮、蓋中國爲農業、其購買力依於農產物之豐歉而有仲縮、據目下華方所傳、今年之耕種、因全國氣候順適、睛雨得宜、呈近年稀有之豐收、而在爲農產物豐庫之東三省、尤因耕種旣佳、治安無虞、與去年因俄事紛糾而擾亂者大異、</p>
<p>又據魯方消息、魯冀豫三省本年度之耕種、爲稀見之豐收、高梁·粟·落花生·烟葉等、俱有增收之望、其中有倍於常年者、又如小麥、春季耕種頗佳、此可見最近兩三年來繼續大旱之華北已漸脫離困境、而亦爲陜甘大旱和緩之一證、又今夏豫省屢屢降雨、爲二三年來所無、豫省豐收、亦可培植農民之購買力、剌戟對外貿易、此不獨河南已也、</p>
<p>長江以南各省向與華北有異、每因降雨過多以至歉收、今年尙未聞苦於洪水之地、恐本年度之豐收、爲普遍全國之大豐收、是刺戟下半年之對外貿易、使達最高潮之根本條件業已具備、惟欲使此條件發揮而無遺憾、有必須充足之先决條件、此無他、即希望地跨豫魯冀三省之對内戰爭迅速終結耳、如戰事早結、農產物自由運出、前途和平有望、則迄今因戰亂飢饉而閉息之經濟活動忽被促進、本年下半年貿易將見意外之隆盛、</p>
<p>試觀本年七月之貿易狀態、已呈活氣、其中廣東商况尤爲旺盛、並與上海市塲以刺激、此蓋因本年上半年廣東雖因桂派挑戰、戰亂繼起、及五六月桂派入湘、兩廣地方已歸平穩之故、迄今繼續之戰亂一旦終結、則其地經濟界即時復活、有如此者、</p>
<p>故今年下半年之對華貿易、得舉如何之成績、一在戰事鎭定之遲速如何、今日上海存銀二萬二千萬兩、爲銀價大跌之特殊原因、如當本年全國大豐收之際、内亂鎭定、暫告平和、上海之銀資爲内地農村間所吸收、銀價大跌將大緩和、又擾亂江南地方之共產匪衆之跳梁、旣因内戰警備缺陷而生、觀其影響貿易之大、不得不希望戰爭迅速終結云、</p>

<p>試行輸入之日繭約二百担</p>
<p>據東報載、據駐滬日横竹商務參事官二十八日電、中國海關近對試行輸入之日本產繭、徵收從價輸入稅一成二分五釐、而國府依於蘇浙製絲圑之請願、擬定自十月起、在六個月有内、以總量數六萬担爲限、減收從價七分五釐、行將令知海關云云、綜合同業所說、試行輸入之日繭僅約二百担、按現在日本市價徵稅一成二分五釐、不甚合算、如徵稅七分五釐、以原價換算、約六百九十兩、有相當輸入之望、惟今年秋蠶雖大體可望豐收、而究能喚起需要幾何、尙屬疑間、要之、從來僅華繭輸日、今一變爲日繭輸華、足値注意云、</p>

<h3 id="c182">不忠實的愛 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 文質</p>
<p>向培良著</p>
<p>在近代、中國文學上的表現、很可以發見一種非常壞的現象、就是一般的作家、太不想對我們的文學施予（忠實）的態度、太（不忠實）地去從事自已的創作了、尤其不去對自已的某一部份專長、更下以深刻的功夫、而作自已所（忠心）於文學的代表、俗語說、（猪頭肉三不精）、實在、在目前的文壇上、很有着這種反映了、關於戲劇方面更際遇到不幸、眞眞努力於戲劇的作者、誠是少見、大多數是抱着（不妨在這方面嘗試嘗試看）的態度去從事戲劇的創作、至於眞能有所抱負、而且不絶地去努力的、則在我所發見的、尙不能冠以如何的數目字、</p>
<p>我曾用心考察過中國文壇上的努力於戲劇的作者、我也曾私願過廣爲收集新文藝運動以來的戲劇作品、加以詳明的剖解、對於所有的戲劇作者也加以一番分析的工作、但、終因事務的牽制、一時祇能在恍惚中、尙無甚樣的把握、然終以不（鏡花水月）作爲自已的期望吧、不過、在過去的戲劇作者中、我固也未始不有佩服的人、在這裏、（不忠實的愛）的作者向培良君、便是其中的一位、他對於戲劇的態度是這樣的、我只要能夠爲戲劇稍許盡一點力、如一個農夫至少掘得一兩鋤頭、縱然使我的努力或許全是空虚、但只要是曾經努力過能、我呢、是不會有什麽後悔的、是的、當戲劇運動在中國的生命還很短促的這時期、正需要一般（忠實）者像農夫那樣去掘、即使是一兩鋤頭、</p>
<p>作者自已是承認了的、對於戲劇是將要有所造就、這、確也是一件値得我忻喜的事、在作者自已也以爲（整個戲劇的工作都需要長時期的艱苦的勞力的、）他告訴我們、（從最初一個靈感被把握住到寫完了最後一句話、從起意表演一個劇本到最後一幕幕落、這中間有着無窮無盡的勞力、没有忍耐的人是不行的、）可見他在創作劇本的時候、是何等精細和賣力、來盡情地發揮着這一個完整的生命了、在最近作者發表的作品、都大半趨重於戲劇一方面、小說是不大見了、但是、他寫劇本的艱苦、據他自已說、（當副刋編輯的時候常一早上寫幾千字、但是我的獨幕劇却没有不經過三個月的、我寫文字不大起草寫完了也很少修改、但劇本至少改三次、）這眞是何等樣的毅力、這些、原也僅是我想證明作者寫作時的態度的嚴謹吧了、</p>
<p>（不忠實的愛）裏有着二個劇本、（不忠實的愛）和（離婚）、作者是差不多寫了一年光景的、這二篇多幕劇還是作者的前期的作品、因爲作者是把握住了（寫劇本須從多幕着手）的、大槪在這二篇以後、似乎作者就已轉入獨幕劇了、確然這二篇的氣分是多少和（飄渺的夢）相同的、然而雖作於（沉悶的戲劇）之前、却發表於（光明的戲劇）之前不久、我想這二篇多幕劇、或者即是代表作者初期的作風與努力的傾向和多幕劇的技巧、也許就是値得紀念的多幕劇吧、</p>
<p>這都是以青年的羅曼史爲題材的、非常富有諷剌性的情調、在向君全部的劇本中、幾乎都有一個共通點、就是作者自已的生命力的發揮很是强烈、關於訴說自已内心的話的地方、似乎很顯明地宣露着的、那生之活力、更是代表了作者自已的意志啊、（不忠實的愛）是三幕劇、是寫一椿都會裏的故事、開首就引愛羅先珂搖籃歌的首末兩節作象徵、（孩子哭了、親愛的哭了、他哭著在搖籃裏、雖然有很好的玩意兒、他不願意安謐、靜靜的睡着罷、小孩子、帶着你的玩意、在晚上好的小孩子、都睡在搖籃裏、）如果把這兩節詩細細體味起來、立刻可知道作者在這齣悲劇裏所要指點人的示意了、這是寫一個二十七歲的大學畢業生、和一個認識不到半年的天眞爛漫年纔十八歲的女孩子結婚的一幕不忠實的戀愛、男主人公龍英南是因爲疲倦了那在脫離大學以後、飄飄蕩蕩的、從這兒到那兒、没有一點歸宿的生活、於是、想在這最後一次、再來試試、他的目的是爲了要用新的剌激同新的痛苦來變更内心的注意、所以便選擇了結婚同戀愛、冀有所彌補了過去缺陷、他們並没有理會得此的性情有否相了解、（我不問他對我的愛情怎麽樣、我是這樣做去、暫顧目前吧、我所需要的愛情、我要自已製造出來、）可知女主人公陶亞文對於（愛）的見解也是很淺浮而未曾有所成見的、</p>
<p>不久、終於陶亞文給那專描寫戀愛的文學家吳夢茵所蠱惑了、瞞了丈夫答應吳夢茵的約、她雖然知道了丈夫近來的行事往往很勉强、有着深潛的悲感、却藏着不肯發洩出來、但她是並不去理解丈夫係爲什麽而這麽苦悶的、要丈夫不喝酒、却不去解剖丈夫爲什麽而渴酒的、終於龍英南在懇求般地要妻子不赴吳夢茵的約而遭拒絶後這樣的咀咒了、（我想在愛情裏面、暫時休息、原想愛情作蔽蔭、躱避風雨和怒潮、可驚的文明的侵襲、但是、成功了還是失敗了呢、）實際、龍英南所討好於妻子的、祇在爲妻子的奢華和虚榮的講求、寗願自已弄得非常拮据而非得向友朋借錢、他不想用偉大的事業來克服妻子、反要忘掉人類的天職和社會上的地位、他只要像一個僕人奉事主人一般、自然以女子心理的企求、也會失望的啊、但是、一方面龍英南的痛苦是日益曾加、一方面陶亞文的壓迫也成熟了、在公園裏、吳夢茵以威脅要狹的手段向陶亞文求愛、甚至拿假手槍來表示堅决、幸而爲龍英南的朋友識破了眞情、乃得救、至於這幕悲劇便在這天同一的地點發生了、接着、龍英南便也到來、他承認自已的錯誤、（爲要免掉不可抵抗的憂鬱的侵襲、我想把全心全身都消磨在愛情裏面、免得再想到旁的事）而勉强去求愛的錯誤、在說了（我愛你……這是第一次的愛你、也是最後的愛你、）就突然拿出手槍自殺了、雖則這時陶亞文知道了他的心了、而尤其愛他這一意孤行的性格、然而完了、因爲他的手槍裏才眞是有子彈的、</p>
<p>誠然、陶亞文的話未始没有研究的價値、（他對於我、雖然處處周到、但是我始終不知道他的心、他依從我的話、迎合我的意思、而這些都彷彿是機械的、他對於我、勉强快樂、勉强說笑、他的話都不是出之於心、……我還年輕哩、我要我自已的生活、合理的生活、而不能愛這樣一個機械的人、也是很正當的、）（八二頁）這、惟其青春的蓓瓂凷没有得到眞正的安慰、誰都會感覺乏味的、所以時代的青年不可單因着某種的要求而去求愛、正是要怎樣支支造這（偉大的愛呵、）</p>
<p>（離婚）是四幕劇、故事是這樣的、大學生章絜之因淡滿於舊禮敎乕制度下的俗話說（有吃無看相）的妻子而亟思離婚、他一方面更私自進行着他的愛瞞了自己是已結過婚的、他的計劃想在愛情成熟時、便郰刻宣布和妻子離婚、但在離婚前是絶對不告訴他的愛人的、以免中途發生變化、却不料在快要成熟的時候、被惡作劇的朋友盡量告訴了他的愛人、使他的愛人大發雷霆、認爲他一切所說的話都是騙人的、而他的最嚴厲的五叔也知道了、在他和那惡作劇的朋友商量善後的時候、又趕來把他訓斥了一頓、於是離婚的計劃、完全失敗了、可是那裏知道、原來所有的事故都是他的朋友們打賭而閙的鬼呀、因着朋友們的打賭、破壞了他所追求的愛了、</p>
<p>本來青年對於新思潮的洗禮是特别會領受的、家庭代定下的没有愛情的婚姻、怎能滿意呢、可是假使對於妻子的條件祗爲了快樂快樂、（第一要緊的是漂亮、其交次是要會交際應酬、跳跳舞、唱唱歌、按按鋼琴、帶出去才有個趣兒、）（一○四頁）於是而厭棄自已扔妻子、那眞太没有認識、太無聊了吧、我更以爲、假若在木已成舟以後、便也要爲自已妻子的出路着想、在此新舊交替的時代、是否此舉與她無害、因爲舊社會的桎梏地痺了她整個的思想、在她的最後、是惟有（自盡）、那末、苟除去了個人的立塲、是可能的嗎、</p>
<p>這兩篇劇本、在大體上說、並不怎樣失敗、劇詞很流暢、命意也很深刻、結構還嚴緊、但是、我以爲和向君從　所著各獨幕劇、比較起來、似乎差些、他的獨幕劇的表現隨處可以看得見比多幕劇緊臻有力、這是我的一點私見、質諸向君、以爲何如、</p>

<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>沐鴻作</p>
<p>（狂颷運動）突現於中國文　、有似已經是好幾年前的事、關於這類的作品、那時我最愛讀的、除了培良的戲劇與小說之外、便是沐鴻的詩與散文了、因爲沐鴻的作品、是别具了一種新的風格、旣不模仿西洋文人、又不効學中國古代的文學作品、祗表現他自已、像這樣富於創造的精神、委實使我們敬佩、換言之、這種充滿了眞的生命的文學、在被外人稱爲齢文化落後的中國、是非常的需要大量底產生、但可惜、據我知道、祇有在最近還繼續努力着的沐鴻一人、</p>
<p>母須說、他近來的作品、在藝術上是有更使人滿意的進展、我看他每篇作品、决不是馬馬虎虎冩灤成的、在每一辭句之間、顯然地可以理會到是費了幾許的精力、形式方面、總是趨於新的、他這篇（荒原裏的風、）愈形使我們滿意、委實新頴得可喜、</p>
<p>本篇是分上下兩段、每一段又分若干小節、充滿了豐富的詩意、眞的與其說他是一種新形式的小說、無寗說他是一種新形式的抒情詩、因爲作者富於想像力、最長於寫散文與及寫抒情詩的、祇要讀過他底作品的人、便會深信無疑的了、</p>
<p>爲了他所寫的是長詩、當然灌輸了不少深刻的象徵力、才能使一篇作品具有超人的生氣、在一般鑑賞能力稍微薄弱些的讀者、竟不能了解他所寫的是什麽、不過很能執着一顆異常熱烈的心、無論如何要使你將它一口氣讀完、覺得是具有特異的風調、這便是新的充滿了深刻寓意的佳構、這篇（荒原裏的風、）當然是也這樣、現在我們可以細心地看他所寫的了、</p>
<p>我們如今荒凉、荒凉如水呵、我們自已要禱祝、（不許冰結或消亡、）凉水還可沸騰上蒸、</p>
<p>這是什麽、顯然是寫的富有向上意識的散文詩、雖然是說身世的荒凉、但是在接着他便想像到（凉水還可沸騰上蒸、）這是多麽有幽默的深意、使我們讀了、不會感到異樣的單調、在這很簡略的字句中、</p>
<p>咱身兒是亡羊、不必再把老巢找、找老牢者不見多少、誰說、（已經斬了腰、）今日的事、只是咱們的身首兒何等苦勞、可否換得一件安然的臥床來睡悶覺、老友們的熱閙的聚會眞慇　、我們敬謝討了你們的擾、我們還想望、安然人的手中、會賜一點眞友情、不給臥床時、給幾匹瘦馬跑—我們幾日離戰塲、今已髀肉生、癢癢願賽千里足、月明地上照、可是馬、眞可愛、戰塲幾次摔落掉、都被咱翻身兒一跳、跳上牠的腰、仇敵在前面呑彈飮血呌、咱們呀、一直跑—放馬前驅如逐雀兒般心喜躍、今日懶散才把馬忘了、—忘了呵、咱們並命的寳寳、衆友呀、你們賜惠咱、不給臥床時、給一匹瘦馬跑、且試試戰塲中的血裏跳躍、一條颷風似馬、一捲激浪是咱心濤、昔日狂飛急奔、</p>
<p>天地咽聲也不敢發暴躁…</p>
<p>這一節、委實寫得可愛、在音調上是鏗鏘和諧、不啻是一首有韻的美的散文詩、在辭句上、是多麽精鍊、决不是出乎平凡者的手筆、仔細地讀下去、很像歌吟着一首偉大的戰歌、促使青年人發奮跑上戰塲的最前線、努力殺敵、祇有前進使能取得生命的安慰、祇有掙扎才能見到光明、這是歷史給予我們的事實、不過在現代的文學作品中、以這樣含有力與美的寫製、實在還不多、（荒原裹的風）底作者、便亦裸裸地表現於字行之間、詔示於我們的眼前了、原來、古今中外所成功的英雄豪傑、没有一個不是從萬分的困難中掙扎出來的、實際、一般青年人、决不應該甘自落後、終日昏昏曚曚做不勞而獲的夢想、現在是怒馬奔騰的時候、實不容青年人長此不振作鬼混下去了、至少、我們讀了上面所徵引的一節含有力與美的散文詩、覺得有這樣感想、</p>
<p>作者這篇新形式的小說、我們竟可把它當作抒情的戰歌讀、因爲詩、是最多感動讀者的心、尤其是音韻鑑鏘、情緒雄放而激昻的、偉大的戰歌、在中國委實很少、</p>
<p>全篇的事實、是非常的複雜、起首是寫（許多心纞着一個情人、但是情人於今死了、）希望帶個消息來、要知道這消息、當然祇有從（墓地裏）或是（鬼門關）才可以得到、實際、這許多情熱如火的心、須努力向上、衝進前去、後來這篇中的主人翁覺悟到這一點、便躍上了馬、跑到戰塲上去、（像荒原裏的風、自吹自唱了去、）裏面還錯雜着許多促人向上的描寫、最後、母須說是得到異樣的成功、即如在第十六節裏、已有這樣的寫着、（革命已成功）、人心歌且樂、西走藏陲你出家、我投東海抱明月）之句、是含有無限生底意義</p>
<p>最使我們企羨的、是作者將這悠長抒情詩、分了若干節去描寫、每一節都有一種新的格調、不同的風韻、使讀者百讀不厭、所以、作者寫這篇（荒原裏的風、）實費了不少思索的苦心、的確、（沐鴻以他風行雲湧的氣分、寫出内心的伸訴、情調深靜、詞句美麗、而更特異的是、他就在那深靜與美麗之中、吐出强有力的絶呌的呼息、荒原裏的風、正是他特有的風格之作品）、以這幾句話來推荐沐鴻、是再切當没有的了、爲了他底作品有眞正的價値、我們不妨再讀它一節、以作本文的結束、想愛好他作品的也贊同的、</p>
<p>世世生生我不能忘你的忠誠、鳥飛獸走豈同我情之漂淪、今我只離用了你的身兒呵、我却跟定你的心情兒在行途中、</p>
<p>行途中你要健步行、一個生人才眞的有用、我便愛我在生的愛者呵、且願助之以勇敢的血情、</p>
<p>我魂兒已爲你一再醒、這猶如生存的人間情、相抱相吻何取閡隔、我仍有一顆活的人心、便請帶歸這顆活的心、也不枉你幾日此地的放縱、我們的心兒原是一致的呵、都將大成於這生未完的途中、</p>

<p>▲The Purpose of Needing Workers</p>
<p>Recently, I often have the opportunity to visit factories and enjoy talking with the workers. Many of them say, "(We shed blood and sweat, working hard. Of course, it's very tiring, but how can this suffering compare to one-thousandth or one-hundredth of what the manager experiences?)" This is one argument. I also overheard two workers chatting. One said, "(Sitting in cars every day, eating fancy meals, living in foreign-style houses, being a manager must be so interesting!)" The other shook his head and said, "(Interesting? That's not the case. You have to know that when they sit in cars, it's not for pleasure but to shorten time, sacrificing their rest. Do they really want to sit? Eating fancy meals is the most tasteless thing, but for the sake of business and various related matters, they have no choice but to endure. Do they really want to eat?…)" These words all came from the mouths of workers, admirable indeed. But what does the factory management hope for from our workers? There are no other extravagant desires, only the hope that workers not only use their labor but also their minds, not only looking after themselves but also considering the overall situation. The more blood and sweat you shed, the wider the path you open for others. In times of hardship and boredom, don't be indignant. You must understand that having a barely sufficient life is already an unparalleled blessing. Now, of course, you are working hard. But I must ask you to think about how much more those who are jobless and unemployed suffer?</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Min Lu Xingbang's troops colluded with communist bandits to harass Wuping, Yongding, and Shanghang, attempting to disrupt the East River area of Guangdong, including Dapu, Jiaoling, and Pingyuan. Jin Handing's rebel troops, Wei and Zhou's two brigades, simultaneously harassed the northern part of Guangdong, including Jiangnan, Nanxiong, and Shixing. This was detected by the Two Chens, who have decided on a plan to respond. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) In the case of Tan Shuqing's execution of communists in the Donghai defense area, the Central Party Department believes that the legal procedures were not followed and handed it over to the General Headquarters for punishment. Tan was therefore detained in the Military Law Department. Later, due to the rise of the punitive expedition against Guangxi, Tan was familiar with the situation in the two Guangs and was assigned to the Sixth Route Army Headquarters to serve on the front lines and atone for his sins. Now, because Tan has contributed greatly in the battle to capture Guiping and in the battles on the Longhai Railway, Jiang has requested the Central National Government to dismiss Tan's case. This has been approved by the 104th Standing Committee of the Central Government. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e17">The New Party of Turkey <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Since the Turkish revolution, it has been able to win diplomatic victories and has had no internal strife. Many people praise it, thinking that Turkey's revolution is a good example to follow. However, recently, due to the expulsion of opponents to the border, negotiations with Persia have arisen. Now, due to the return of the new party leader Feise, conflicts between welcomers and the police have arisen. Although the cause of this may not seem very important today, internal strife in Turkey may arise from this. This is truly not something to be taken lightly.</p>
<p>The reason Turkey established this new party was to solve Turkey's economic and financial difficulties. Currently, the economies and finances of all countries in the world are affected by the global commercial downturn, and almost no country is without difficulties. It is questionable whether the new parties in countries around the world can solve Turkey's economic and financial difficulties. And after this conflict between the new party and the government, the political views of the two sides are in irreconcilable positions. Their future actions will inevitably be mutually hostile and will become increasingly severe. The result will even develop into fierce internal strife. The smooth progress of the Turkish revolution has met with obstacles today. It is truly not an easy task to build a newly rising and powerful country.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Sudden Success of the Argentine Revolution <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Provisional Military Government Established</p>
<p>General Uriburu as President</p>
<p>Army and Navy Join the Revolutionary Action</p>
<p>President Irigoyen, Bereft of Popular Support, Detained</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th - A dispatch from Buenos Aires reports the success of the revolution. Government offices have raised white flags.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th - Unofficial sources in Buenos Aires today report that approximately one thousand people were killed or wounded in the Argentine revolution. The revolutionary army has formed a military government to take over administration, with General Uriburu as president and Conservative Senator Marina as vice president.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th - The latest news from Argentina received here this morning states that President Irigoyen has been detained in a barracks in Buenos Aires. Irigoyen has now submitted a formal letter of resignation. His term was due to expire on October 2, 1934.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, 6th - President Irigoyen received the most votes in the 1928 election, but has now suddenly lost popular support beyond recovery. This is due to his reclusive nature, lack of awareness of public sentiment, bewilderment when the crisis arose, and misplaced trust in unworthy individuals. Two of his cabinet members were his confidants, but these two were mutually suspicious and vying for power, blinding Irigoyen to their schemes, which was the main cause of his downfall.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, 7th - The provisional government of the revolutionary army has ordered the dissolution of Congress. General Uriburu issued a proclamation declaring that the provisional government intends to respect the constitution, restore local order, and hold free elections. Furthermore, members of the provisional government have pledged not to accept nominations for the presidency. Reuters, New York, 6th - News from Buenos Aires reports a tense situation. Most of the army within the city limits of Buenos Aires is disloyal to President Irigoyen. The navy's attitude is uncertain. Troops led by the nephew of former President Uriburu are awaiting orders to enter the capital. He has issued an ultimatum to Irigoyen to resign, or he will shell the presidential palace. This morning, one army plane flew over the presidential palace and the president's residence. A few minutes later, twenty planes returned in formation, then flew back to the Palomar airfield.</p>
<p>Reuters, Buenos Aires, 6th - A revolution has erupted. The navy has joined the army in a joint effort to overthrow the 78-year-old President Irigoyen. Admiral Storni, commander of seventeen warships in the harbor, has submitted a notice to the government signed by the officers of each ship, stating that the navy is unwilling to fire on General Uriburu's troops. The First Cavalry Regiment initially refused to join the revolution, but after a half-hour standoff, has now submitted. Lieutenant Torres of the opposition party refused to join and was shot dead by his comrades today. President Irigoyen is now surrounded on all sides.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 7th - A dispatch from Buenos Aires states that troops arriving from the north and south are quite friendly with the people. They are now surrounding the administrative offices where the cabinet has been meeting all day. The government, having no alternative, has raised a white flag in surrender. The people poured into the offices, tore down pictures of Irigoyen, and burned them in the streets. A portion of the police opened fire on the revolutionary army, which responded with machine guns, resulting in several deaths and injuries. The crowd burned down several newspaper offices. Firefighters refused to assist the police. The whereabouts of Irigoyen and his cabinet members are currently unknown.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 6th - A United Press dispatch from Buenos Aires reports that the Argentine coup has significantly affected the wheat market. Wheat trading today was extremely slow, unprecedentedly so.</p>

<h3 id="e41">League Council Meeting <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Opening This Morning</p>
<p>Agenda Mostly Thorny Issues</p>
<p>Pan-European Plan Likely to Fail</p>
<p>National News, Geneva, 6th - This meeting may be one of the most important since the establishment of the League of Nations. The Council meeting will open on Monday morning, with an agenda full of thorny issues. In the afternoon, French Foreign Minister Briand will chair a meeting on his European federation plan, which will be a closed-door discussion. However, even with Briand's eloquence, it is feared that he will find it difficult to realize his plan. Even among the French here, many advocate entrusting the matter to a committee for temporary shelving, because Briand's proposal for a federation has triggered demands from various nations to revise treaties, which the French greatly fear. However, the special meeting of the twenty-six European nations will, regardless of the outcome, present all the issues discussed to the League Assembly, which will open on Wednesday. Among the various cases discussed by the League, Italy's demand for a thorough reorganization of the League's administrative organs, which are currently controlled by Britain and France, is also a difficult problem. In addition, plans regarding security issues, one for financial assistance to countries that have been invaded and one for the harmonization of the League's charter with the Kellogg-Briand Pact, will also be difficult to agree upon. Finally, there is the issue of electing council members. Canada's seat will expire at the end of the year, and not only China, Ireland, and Belgium are vying for it, but the Union of South Africa is also strongly competitive. Although the French are making every effort to support Belgium, it is generally believed that South Africa has the best chance. National News, Copenhagen, 6th - Danish Foreign Minister Munch, before departing for Geneva to attend the League of Nations Assembly, stated that the most-favored-nation clause is most likely to cause political and commercial disputes between nations. He intends to propose convening an international conference to formulate a common interpretation of the clause, in order to avoid disputes.</p>

<p>Reuters, Constantinople, 6th - Supporters of Fethi Bey, leader of the Turkish Free Republican Party, clashed with the ruling party in Smyrna today. Police opened fire, killing one child and wounding twenty-four others, and arresting many people. Fethi Bey resigned from his position as ambassador to France a month ago and founded a new political party with the aim of solving Turkey's economic and financial difficulties. When Fethi Bey arrived in Smyrna from Constantinople last Thursday, crowds of people gathered to welcome him, clashing with the police, resulting in the arrest of three hundred people.</p>

<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Investigates the Truth</p>
<p>Tokyo News - There are rumors that Russian shares in the Chinese Eastern Railway are being transferred to the United States, and that representatives from the US and Russia are currently negotiating in Hamburg. The Japanese government is paying close attention to this matter because it will have a significant impact on its policy towards Manchuria. It has instructed Acting Ambassador Togo in Germany and Consul General Murakami in Hamburg to investigate the truth. According to their reports, this is just a false rumor spread by speculators. The US and Russian embassies in Berlin have also denied the fact of negotiations. There is currently no evidence to prove that negotiations are taking place.</p>

<p>Flaws in Austerity Policy Exposed</p>
<p>Review of Naval Treaty Encounters Many Obstacles</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th - With the review of the treaty bill as its focus, the future of Japanese politics appears bleak. Regarding the current situation, opinions from various quarters are as follows: The House of Peers generally believes that if the government confronts the Privy Council head-on, it is unpredictable what kind of imperial decision will be made, even if the government submits a counter-petition. Therefore, the government's position on the treaty bill is far from optimistic. Even if it passes, it cannot be said with certainty that there will be no political changes due to budget preparation and financial problems. The Seiyukai, on the other hand, believes that a head-on clash between the Privy Council and the government is inevitable, and the focus is on the arms reduction plan. Political change will occur because of this. Furthermore, the government's economic and financial policies have now stalled. If it continues its passive approach, it will be very difficult to prepare the budget for the next fiscal year. The flaws in the current government's policies have been exposed, and there is no other way but to resign en masse. The flaws in policy are a fatal blow to a party cabinet. When the Privy Council confronts the government head-on, the government will inevitably be blamed for infringing on imperial prerogatives. The Minseito believes that the treaty bill is entirely for the sake of international friendship and reducing the burden on the people. Therefore, the government is responsible for signing it, and the entire nation supports it. The Privy Council is also clearly aware of this trend of public opinion, so it will definitely not reject it. If it does reject it, the government will have to submit a counter-petition and engage in a final constitutional action in order to reduce the burden on the people. Therefore, the prospects for the political situation are extremely bleak, with a high probability of an eruption at any time. Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 7th - The budget estimates for each ministry for the sixth year of Showa (1931) have all been submitted. Among them, the new requests from each ministry alone have reached 90 million yen. In addition, there are supplementary plans for the Ministry of the Navy, unemployment relief expenses for the Ministry of Home Affairs, and additional requests for construction expenses from the Ministry of Finance. The government's original intention of not including new requests has now been completely violated. The total amount will reach 123 million yen, while the free financial resources from the surplus are only a little over one million yen. No matter how much the existing expenses are reduced, it is impossible to compensate for this unprecedented shortfall in revenue. The Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance said that, with the exception of urgent ones, all of the new requests must be deducted, with a very firm attitude.</p>

<p>One-Third of the Sixty Member Companies</p>
<p>Are Operating at a Loss</p>
<p>Unemployment Across the Country Continues to Increase</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 7th - The decline of the cotton industry is extremely severe. According to the Spinning Association, the performance of yarn factories across Japan in the first half of this year shows that out of the sixty member companies, twenty-four are operating at a loss (compared to the same period last year, when out of fifty-six companies, only four were operating at a loss). The total loss amounted to 8,538,000 yen. After deducting from the total profits of the profitable companies, the net profit was 8,638,000 yen, less than one-third of the same period last year. Furthermore, the average red ink rate for each factory is 9% per year, which, compared to 52.7% in the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), is like a world apart, a record low since 8.3% in the second half of the forty-third year of Meiji (1910).</p>
<p>Japan Associated Press, Tokyo, 7th - Due to the recession in Japan, the number of unemployed factory and mine workers continues to increase. According to a survey by the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, in May of this year, 66,277 factory and mine workers were laid off, while 36,830 were hired, resulting in 30,000 newly unemployed workers.</p>

<p>Telegram from Chongqing - Respectfully to the gentlemen of the fellow villagers associations traveling to Beijing, the fire that broke out inside and outside the Chuchi and Jinzi gates of Chongqing lasted a full day and night, burning down nearly ten thousand houses and many wooden boats on the river. The total loss of property is estimated at tens of millions. Boatmen, residents, and firefighting troops and police were injured or killed. It was an unprecedented disaster. In addition to the severe drought, rice is expensive, firewood is scarce, the autumn wind is bleak, and the climate is oppressive. Witnessing the grieving cries, our pain increases many times. Commander Yanri Fu has ordered the Dongchuan Daoyin to cooperate with the mayor of Chongqing City and convene various Jiangba counties, city and county agencies, legal entities, and charitable groups to elect members of the reconstruction committee to establish this association, which will divide into working groups within the municipal government. The Chongqing Mayor Pan Wenhua was publicly elected as chairman, Dongchuan Daoyin Liu Hongye and the director of Chongqing's Social Affairs Bureau Li Yuhang were elected as vice-chairmen. We will combine the efforts of all parties and formulate a comprehensive plan to quickly and effectively benefit these survivors of the disaster. In addition to Commander Fu already allocating 20,000 silver dollars for immediate distribution, various aspects of the aftermath need to be funded, and because the disaster is so severe, we are especially relying on the strength of the group. We are telegraphing our words. We implore all of you gentlemen to spread benevolence and revive these disaster victims, and we hope you will give us instructions so that we may follow your guidance. We anxiously await your reply. The Chongqing Fire Disaster Relief Committee bows and stamps.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Bloody Battle Near Changsha <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Zhu De, and Mao Zedong Invade with All Their Forces</p>
<p>Completely Repelled by Noon on the 4th</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence, 5th - Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Li Shixing, Kong Hechong, Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, and others, claiming to be the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Twenty, and Twenty-Sixth Armies of the Red Army, starting on the evening of the 30th of last month, divided into three routes to invade the provincial capital of Changsha: (1) Peng, Huang, Li, and Kong's units crossed the Dongtun Ferry and Lake Ji Ferry, and detoured to Laodao River to attack Changsha; (2) Zhu De advanced from Daqiao Wumeiling and detoured to Monkey Stone to attack Changsha; (3) Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, and others attacked Changsha from the side via Jiufeng Town and Datuo Pu. The Fourth Route Army had long anticipated that the communists would invade with all their forces, and a week ago they constructed defensive works five or ten miles from the provincial capital, with trenches thirty miles long, an electric fence outside the trenches, and obstacles such as bamboo spikes outside the fence. The troop deployments were as follows: (1) The 15th Division (Commander Wei Suzhong), the 19th Division (Commander Liu Jianxu), and a portion of the 16th Division guarded the electric fence and trenches. (2) The 31st Division (Commander Tao Guang) and the 7th Independent Regiment (Commander Chen Guangzhong) were the right-wing striking forces, encircling the communist headquarters at Dongshan from Monkey Stone and Datuo Pu. (3) The entire 22nd Division (Commander Luo Lin), plus two regiments under Gong Bingfan, were the left-wing striking forces, encircling from Luohanzhuang and Laodao River to Lake Ji Ferry and Dongtun Ferry. (4) The Xiang'e armored train assisted the right wing, charging along the railway towards Monkey Stone and Datuo Pu at any time. The Xianning and Yongsheng warships took turns bombarding the river surface at Laodao River and Monkey Stone. Airplanes dropped bombs from the sky at any time. (5) The main force of Gong Bingfan's division was the general reserve force, ready to respond and reinforce at any time. He Jian stayed at Miaogaofeng day and night, directing everything. On the evening of the 30th of last month, at 7:00 PM, the communists used 1,000-2,000 water buffaloes as a vanguard, tying cotton to their tails and setting them on fire to charge the electric fence. They were all repelled by the units defending the trenches, with 100-200 buffaloes killed, and the remaining buffaloes scattered, some even running back to the communist positions. On the 31st, the communists again used fire buffaloes to charge the electric fence, still without success. There was no major contact in the above two days, and neither side suffered many casualties. From September 1st, the Peng, Huang, Zhu, Mao, Lin, and Kong communist units concentrated and launched a fierce attack on the provincial capital. The bloody battle began, with artillery fire rumbling day and night. In order to lure the communists deep in and annihilate them, the National Army continued to defend the original defenses. The communists launched twenty to thirty charges in a row, but were repelled each time, suffering heavy casualties. On the 2nd, it suddenly rained heavily, and the trenches were flooded. The communists braved the rain to attack fiercely, breaking through the electric fence at Ami Ridge outside the Liuyang Gate (five miles from the city). Fortunately, the Wang Huangyuan regiment of the 15th Division joined the firefight and fought desperately, finally repelling the communists. That night, the National Army continued to defend the original positions. He Jian ordered that at dawn on the 3rd, each army would change from defense to offense, and the left and right wing units would attack the communists simultaneously. From dawn on this day, Chen Guangzhong and Tao Guang's units attacked from the right wing and fought fiercely with the communists at Datuo Pu, Tongjing Pu, Monkey Stone, Lan Ni Pu, Shima Pu, Yuhua Ting, Huang Tu Ling, and other places. The fierce battle lasted until noon on the 4th, killing thousands of communists. Zhu De was injured at Heishi Pu, with bullets hitting his left arm and neck. According to prisoners of war, he has already been killed. The communists then retreated to Dongshan. Chen Guangzhong's unit commanders Chen Wo and Wan Fangzhi, and regiment commander He Yunlong were also injured and taken back to Xiangya Hospital for treatment. In addition, about 1,000 officers and soldiers were injured or killed. Chen ordered his subordinates to cut off the ears of each communist killed and present them. They returned with three loads of ears and continued to pursue towards Dongshan. As for the left wing, Luo Lin's division and a unit of Gong Bingfan's division attacked the Peng, Kong, and other communists at dawn on the 3rd. Luo Lin personally directed the battle at Luohanzhuang, engaging in repeated battles and multiple melee combats at Baimao Pu, Yazi Pu, Lake Ji Ferry, Dongtun Ferry, and other places. The units defending the trenches came out to respond, and airplanes flew back and forth bombing, killing 1,000-2,000 communists. The battle continued until the morning of the 4th, when the communists began to retreat to Dongshan. Luo's division also suffered several hundred casualties. Zhu, Mao, Peng, Huang, and other communists suffered this great defeat and, seeing the National Army pressing forward step by step, fled towards Puji City and Yong'an City in western Liuyang on the evening of the 4th. The siege of Changsha was thus lifted. He Jian telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Zhuang and Wuhan Headquarters Director He Yingqin yesterday to report the victory. The telegram reads as follows: (Urgent, to Commanders-in-Chief Jiang, River Willow Returns, Returning Virtue, Ji Nan Tanshe, and Commander He of the Hankou Headquarters, Zhigou Telegram has reached your eyes. Upon investigation, the communists Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Li Shixing, Kong Hechong, etc., joined forces with Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Lin Biao, etc., calling themselves the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Tenth, Twenty, and Twenty-Sixth Armies of the Red Army, and attacked Changsha again. From the 30th until noon today, we fought bloody battles for six days and nights, with dozens of melee combats. Thanks to the assistance of the Gong (Bingfan) and Luo (Lin) divisions, the Xianning and Yongsheng warships, the Xiang'e armored train, and aircraft, we wounded the communist leader Zhu De, killed 4,000-5,000 communists, and the number of captured weapons is still being investigated. Our Chen commander Wo, regiment commander He Yunlong, and Wan Fangzhi were injured. Dozens of company, platoon, and squad leaders were killed or wounded, and over a thousand soldiers were injured or killed. The communists are now fleeing from Zhongsi Port, Dongshan, Langli City, and Tiao Ma Jian towards Liuyang. Our army is dividing into routes to pursue them. This is a preliminary telegram, and details will be reported later. [Signed] He Jian, Zhiyin)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Second Yunnan Army Siege of Nanning <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - The Yunnan Army that entered Guangxi had previously besieged Nanning once, holding out against the Guangxi Army for several months. Later, due to strategic considerations, they retreated to Funan, Lu, and other places. Recently, after Yu Hanmou's Eighth Route Army attacked Binyang from Guixian, Liuzhou and Nanning lost their logistical connection. The Guangxi Army inside Nanning was isolated and without support. Thus, the Yunnan Army again besieged Nanning. On the 26th of last month, the Yunnan Army advanced in two routes. Lu Han's unit attacked Xiangtang west of Nanning, while Zhu Xu's unit attacked Lugong Ci Mountain north of the city. The Guangxi Army's Wei Yunzong and Lu Fuxiang, etc., retreated completely back into Nanning to defend, due to insufficient defense forces. On the 27th, the Yunnan Army's vanguard occupied Muxing Street outside Nanning and the area around the 34th Camp outside the East Gate, adopting an arc-shaped encirclement of the Guangxi Army inside the city. However, the Yunnan Army lacked heavy artillery, so even though they repeatedly approached Nanning, they were unable to capture it. While the Yunnan Army was besieging the city, the Eighth Route Army's planes flew to Nanning from Wuzhou every day, dropping bombs twice. Most of the residents inside the city had fled to the countryside, and all the shops in the city were closed. As for transportation with Nanning, there are still several electric boats coming and going, which can go directly from Wuzhou to Nanning. However, when the boats arrive at the Nanning border, they can only dock at Tingzi Xu Bay, opposite the commercial port, unload goods, and then leave. The reason is that neither side has troops stationed there. Furthermore, there are no traces of the Guangxi Army in Yongchun and Hengxian downstream of Nanning. By the time they get to Guixian, it is the defense area of the Eighth Route Army. It is said that the Guangxi Army in Nanning is preparing to retreat into Wuming. (September 2)</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony in Hankou</p>
<h3 id="e54">Rally to Eradicate Communists and Condemn Wang Jingwei and Qiu <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: A mass rally in Wuhan to eradicate communists, condemn Wang Jingwei, and celebrate the recapture of Jinan was held at 10:00 AM on the 6th, separately in Wuchang's Yuema Factory and Hankou's Zhongshan Park. Attendees from all walks of life were extremely enthusiastic. The details of the two locations are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Wuchang: The venue was set up at Yuema Factory, with a total of 50,000 attendees including representatives from various levels of Party headquarters, government agencies, organizations, schools, and freely participating citizens. The presidium consisted of Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government Wu Xingya, Director of Education Huang Jianzhong, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government Hua Jueming, Committee Members of the Provincial Party Headquarters Liu Bofang, Yu Yuzhi, Wang Shiliu, Zuo Duo, Ge Yanghuan of Wuhan University, Qian Chong of Wuhan Military Academy, and Gao Shangzhi representing the Wuchang-Changsha-Zhuzhou-Pingxiang Special Party Headquarters. Wu Xingya was elected as the Chairman. After the opening ceremony, the Chairman reported on the significance of the rally, stating that holding this rally to eradicate communists, condemn Wang Jingwei, and celebrate the recapture of Jinan has profound significance. The crimes of the Communist Party and the traitorous acts of Wang Jingwei were thoroughly exposed. The victories achieved by our Central Army after the recapture of Jinan were reported. Finally, he urged the people of Hubei on how they should strive to achieve the goal of eradicating communists and eliminating Wang Jingwei. After Wu's report, Committee Member Zuo Duo of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Representative Qian Chong of the Wuhan Branch of the Central Military Academy, and Representative Liu Bingchu of the Garrison Command successively delivered speeches. Subsequently, seven proposals were passed, and the meeting adjourned with loud slogans.</p>
<p>Hankou: The venue was set up in Zhongshan Park, with participants including representatives from various levels of Party headquarters, government agencies, organizations, and schools, totaling over 20,000 people. The presidium consisted of City Party Headquarters Committee Members Xiao Ruoxu, Liu Yun, Pang Jingtang, Shan Chengyi, Representative Wan Xiuling of the General Headquarters, Representative He Youwu of the Municipal Government, and Song Qidong, Standing Committee Member of the Hanyang Party Headquarters. Shan Chengyi was elected as the Chairman, Hu Difei as the General Commander, and Jin Jutang and Hu Chao as the Deputy Commanders. First, the Chairman reported on the significance of the meeting, roughly dividing it into three points: (1) The crimes of the Communist Party should be paid attention to and eradicated. (2) To eradicate communists, it is necessary to first overthrow Wang Jingwei, who cooperates with the Communist Party and serves as a tool for Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang. (3) Jinan is an important town in the north, and its recent recapture has cut off the enemy's source of transportation of weapons and ammunition. Therefore, the recapture of Jinan is actually a prelude to the recapture of Beiping and Tianjin, and it is worth celebrating enthusiastically. Next, Staff Officer Man Xiuling of the General Headquarters, Representative He Youwu of the Municipal Government, City Party Headquarters Committee Member Liu Yun, Chief Qiu Hongjun of the Maritime Public Security Bureau, and Song Qidong, Standing Committee Member of the Hanyang County Party Headquarters, successively delivered speeches. After passing the proposals, the meeting adjourned with slogans.</p>
<p>Summary of Proposals: The seven proposals passed by both Wuhan sides are largely the same: (1) Send a telegram to the whole country, unanimously condemning Wang Jingwei and the Yan-Feng warlords, and thoroughly eliminate the communist bandits. (2) Telegraph the Commander-in-Chief's General Headquarters, requesting that the communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi be eliminated within the shortest possible time, so that the people can live and work in peace. (3) Telegraph congratulations to Commander-in-Chief Chiang and the front-line soldiers for their victory in suppressing the rebellion, and request that they take advantage of the victory to advance and thoroughly eliminate the remaining forces of the Yan-Feng warlords, so that peaceful unification can be realized as soon as possible. (4) Telegraph Vice Commander-in-Chief Zhang, requesting that he send troops to suppress the rebellion as soon as possible and save the compatriots in the Northwest. (5) Telegraph the Central Government, requesting that it forward a letter to the National Government, clearly commending the soldiers who participated in the suppression of the rebellion this time. (6) Submit a request to the Central Government to send a letter to the National Government, ordering the whole country to prepare for autonomy as soon as possible, implement political tutelage, and alleviate the people's difficulties. (7) Telegraph the Central Government, severely punishing all reactionary elements who participated in the pseudo-expanded conference. (September 6th)</p>

<h3 id="e55">Sending Cars to Pick Up Various Committee Members to Anhui <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The reorganization of the Shandong Provincial Government is about to be realized. According to what has been heard here, Han Fuju will govern Shandong, and Chen Diaoyuan will be transferred to Anhui as the Chairman of the Provincial Government. It is scheduled to be submitted to the State Council for approval and announcement this Friday. Currently, Shandong Provincial Government Committee Members Yuan Jiapu, Yu Enbo, Chen Luanshu and others will also be transferred to serve as Anhui Provincial Government Committee Members. Chen Diaoyuan, because the reorganization of the provincial government is not far away, specially sent Yang Daming, the Chief of the Liaison Section of the Adjutant's Office, to Jinan from Liuhe with a special train to transport Chen's belongings left in Jinan, and to pick up various committee members to Anhui. The train arrived in Jinan at 9:35 AM on the 4th. Chen Guiting, the Chief of the Liaison Section of Chen's General Headquarters, arrived in Jinan with the train and contacted Yu Feipeng, the Director-General of the Army, Navy and Air Force Headquarters Garrison, to collect the guns and ammunition left in Jinan for round-trip transportation. After the central government's order is issued, the committee members will take this special train to Anhui. At 5:00 AM today (5th), the military band of the 46th Division and the remaining personnel of Chen's headquarters and their families in Jinan were first sent south by train. The rest will be transported after the train returns. (September 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e56">After the Central Government's Aircraft Soared Over Beiping and Tianjin <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>City Residents Have Become Birds Frightened by the Twang of a Bow</p>
<p>Military and Police Agencies Under Special Martial Law</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: On August 27th, the Central Army dispatched two aircraft, which flew north from Jinan along the Jinpu Railway, first dropping more than ten bombs on Beiping, and firing two volleys of machine guns at the Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters. Then, they turned to Tianjin, circled once, and fired two volleys of machine guns at the Garrison Headquarters and the Gendarmerie Headquarters. No one was injured in Beiping and Tianjin. Afterwards, various newspaper offices asked the military authorities whether they could publish this news. At the same time, Garrison Commander Yuan Qingzeng believed that this matter had been witnessed by all and could not be concealed, so he allowed it to be published. Unexpectedly, all major and small newspapers in the city were detained by the inspection office on the 28th. The newspapers were in an uproar, thinking that since it had been allowed before, why was it prohibited later? Yuan then ordered their release, but the inspection office not only did not comply, but also protested to the Beiping Garrison Headquarters (Beiping did not prohibit the publication of bomb news), saying that it violated the martial law regulations and should warn the newspapers. The inspection office is directly under the Garrison Headquarters and is not under the command of the Beiping and Tianjin Garrison Headquarters. The ferocity of the Central Army's aircraft destruction, as seen and heard in Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Jinan, has been familiar to the people. Now that they have visited Beiping and Tianjin, the people really feel terrified. Mayor Cui Tingxi does not dare to go to the government office to work. Routine official duties are handled by Secretary-General Liu Jinsheng, and important official duties are sent to the private residence in Special District 2 for approval. Gendarmerie Commander Yuan Qingzeng still goes to the headquarters to work every day, but he leaves after a quick glance. He has now dug an underground cellar, covered with two layers of steel plates and eight feet of soil. As for the people, there have been many false alarms in recent days, and rumors abound. In the Qijin area, it is said that the aircraft have arrived in Beiping again. In Beiping, it is said that the aircraft have arrived in Tianjin. When the two places inquired by long-distance telephone, they both proved to be inaccurate, and they felt a little relieved. The Beiping authorities have erected anti-aircraft guns in front of the Qianmen and Jingshan, knowing that they are not very effective, but they are sufficient to comfort the people. Tianjin has not made any such arrangements to comfort the people. The people are living in a state of constant fear. Furthermore, Beiping has issued a notice to the people on how to avoid bombs, but Tianjin does not have this either. Yesterday, the Garrison Headquarters notified all military, police, constitutional, and political agencies and organizations to completely remove all obvious signs, such as sentry boxes and flagpoles, to prevent aircraft from using them as targets for bombing. The Public Security Bureau also ordered the police in each district to notify households to prepare more candles, oil lamps, and flashlights, because it is necessary to turn off the lights when aircraft come at night, or they may be bombed by the aircraft and destroy the power plant, so it is necessary to burn the midnight oil. Since someone threw bombs and detonated them at the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the New Railway Station, Wuma Road, West Gate of Hebei Middle School, etc.</p>

<p>Military police and gendarmerie in the Hebei area are densely deployed like pieces on a chessboard, shuttling back and forth as if in broad daylight. Those with suspicious behavior are also searched. The lighting is very bright at night. After 9:00 PM every night, pedestrians are cut off. The gates of various agencies are heavily guarded and new gate passes are changed. A bomb was found on Dongmalu Bian Road the night before. The bomb was covered in a watermelon rind. Judging from its intention, if someone kicked the watermelon rind, it would explode. Fortunately, no one kicked it, otherwise, it would be in a busy area and I don't know how many people would be killed or injured. Since yesterday, inspections of ships entering and leaving the port have begun. The intersections of various concessions have also been guarded by police and gendarmerie. Pedestrians are inspected when they travel back and forth at night. Also, due to the discovery of bombs on Dongmalu, the Henan area has also been under special martial law since today. Cinemas close early at 10:00 PM. Various theaters and miscellaneous markets also stop performing at 11:00 PM. However, due to martial law, there are few patrons, and it is feared that they will all stop performing soon. Residents in the Hebei area have now begun to move to the concessions. Rents in the concessions were reduced by less than half a year, and now they are increasing again in response to the times. (August 31st)</p>
<h3 id="e63">Rampant Banditry in Yancheng <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yancheng County, Jiangsu Province, is located on the coast and has always been an important town in Jiangbei. Recently, due to the unrest in the current situation, Ma Yuren secretly colluded with the Northwest, and sneaked back to Yancheng, calling himself a military commander. He gathered thousands of bandits from his old troops, such as Liu Hanmin and Zhou Xiangting, spread throughout the cities and villages of Yancheng, rampaging without restraint. Wherever they passed, houses were turned into ruins, people were killed and set on fire, people were kidnapped for ransom, and self-defense guns were confiscated. They did all kinds of evil, especially in the northwest and southwest areas of the county, which were the most severely affected. In the villages and towns they occupied, people fled. Within dozens of miles nearby, no one could be seen. The county government and the county police team were perfunctory and irresponsible, only seeking to protect the county seat. Although there were hundreds of reports of robbery and distress from the four townships every day, they were ignored. The provincial government had previously sent the 133rd Brigade of the 45th Division to Yancheng to suppress the bandits. On the 24th of last month, they had brief contact with the bandits in the Sanguandian Dongzhengzhuang area in the west township, but the bandits dispersed immediately, and the officers and soldiers did not pursue them. Now the bandits are still entrenched in Xidang, robbing as usual, and even openly summoning township chiefs, setting a deadline for paying a certain amount of silver, otherwise they will burn and kill residents to their heart's content. Residents are forced to flee and seek refuge, and some have no home to return to. Although the autumn harvest is richer than in previous years, what has been harvested has been robbed by bandits, and what has not been harvested has been occupied by bandits. Traffic is blocked and business is not working. The suffering of the Yancheng people this time is probably unprecedented in the past hundred years.</p>
<p>According to a newcomer from Yancheng to the province, in July, Ma Yuren was appointed by Yan Xishan to return to Jiangbei to disturb Hexing Town at the Sheyang River Estuary. He gathered his old troops, contacted bandits, and gathered more than 2,000 people. Everything east of Fantai was almost completely burned and plundered, especially Xintan Chaogang and other places in Beiqizao, which were the most severely affected, because there were more than 300 guard guns there, which had assisted officers and soldiers in suppressing the bandits. When the soldiers left and the bandits came, they arbitrarily burned and killed. The Liu family, with more than 20 people, only three escaped. Around August 20th, Ma Yuren led his team west because there was nothing to plunder east of Fantai, entrenched around Dongzhuang, Zhengzhuang, and around the Liangxiang Township in Yancheng, collecting guns and extorting money from household to household. If they disobeyed, they would set fire. Cries were heard everywhere, and the fires raged. After being besieged by officers and soldiers, they fled west again and again. Now, Ma Yuren personally leads more than 2,000 people, entrenched in Xidang, Shajiazhuang, Gujiazhuang, Peijiatuan, Jiangying, Xi'an, Fengluo, Chaobao, Linshangzhuang, Jiangjiabao and other places, forcing wealthy households to supply bullets and money, middle-class households to provide rice, and the poor to provide labor. Their brutal behavior is also becoming increasingly fierce. People mostly hide in grass houses or rice fields, and some bandit leaders, such as Wu Jinbiao, who once served as the captain of the police team in Yancheng County, have more than 200 people and their behavior is slightly more lenient. They only want guns and money, and do not burn and kill at will. The officers and soldiers stationed in Yancheng and Fuyu, a certain regiment of the 133rd Brigade of the National Army, had fought fiercely with the bandits twice. Once (August 14th) in Xiangjiawei, Funing, the officers and soldiers attacked in seven routes and killed dozens of bandits. They took advantage of the victory to attack Hexing Town, but Ma had led his troops away earlier. Once (August 25th) in Dongzhengzhuang, Ma Yuren personally directed the bandits to resist stubbornly. After a day of fierce fighting, both sides suffered casualties. In the end, the bandits lacked bullets and were defeated and fled west. It is said that Ma's son, Yide, drowned in the water while fleeing in panic. It is a pity that the officers and soldiers failed to pursue and search thoroughly, causing them to regroup in Xidang and become rampant as before, which is a great pity.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Jiangxi Provincial Military Conference for Suppressing Bandits <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Request He Yingqin to Expedite the Plan for a Joint Suppression</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Provincial Chairman Lu Dipin believes that the Special Task Force 123 sent by the Central Government has successively arrived in Xunyang, and the 50th Division of Tan Daoyuan has also arrived in Ganzhou one after another. The Zhu Regiment of Zhejiang arrived in Yushan Guangfeng at the end of last month. A regiment sent by Guangdong Province to Ganzhou for joint defense has also arrived in Ganzhou. Together with Zhang Huihuan and Deng Ying's two divisions and Ma Kun's brigade of the 12th Division originally in the province, and the two regiments of the Provincial Government's Garrison Regiment, the military strength is nearly four divisions, and it is the right time to suppress the bandits on a large scale. Lu convened a military conference in the provincial government the day before yesterday. The attendees included Jia Botao, the liaison staff of the Three-Province Bandit Suppression Headquarters sent by He Yingqin, all the members of the provincial government, Xiao Wenduo, the chief of staff of the 9th Route Army, and Xie Muhan, the director of the staff office. Lu served as the chairman. After the meeting, he reported on the recent bandit situation and the situation of suppression. Then, Lu Xiaochen, Wang Yinxi and others reported on the progress of the Three-Province Bandit Suppression Conference and all the resolutions. Many important cases were discussed, and it was decided to recommend Jia Botao to return to Hankou and report everything to Director He, requesting instructions and asking him to expedite the issuance of a concrete plan for the joint suppression of the three provinces in order to launch a large-scale suppression. Lu also visited Tan Division and Yue Sen Brigade, who had fought in Hunan, Hubei, Lu and Yu, and took a special train on the Nanshan Road to Tujiapu on the morning of the 5th to offer condolences and speak to all the officers and soldiers of the brigade, and returned to the province in the evening. In addition, Lu Xiaochen, the Director of the Security Office, in order to fundamentally eliminate the bandits, submitted a report to the provincial government on the strict implementation of the conscription system. The provincial government has already instructed to approve it. First, a few dozen people each will be conscripted from Yujiang, Leping, and Lichuan counties, which have not been ravaged by the bandits and where the people are honest and brave, and will be incorporated into the 3rd Guard Regiment for trial.

<h3 id="e65">Jilin Province Raises Disaster Relief Funds for Liaoning <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Jilin Correspondence: At the beginning of the month, a major flood occurred in western Liaoning. Provincial Chairman Zhang Zuoxiang, feeling the neighborly friendship and unable to sit idly by, ordered the Finance Department to remit 100,000 Jiyang yuan on the 20th of this month to the Liaoning government to help provide emergency relief. At the same time, charitable organizations will raise additional funds and send them one after another to provide assistance. However, the disaster is extremely serious, and the donations from various parties are small and difficult to reach everyone. The Liaoning government, upon the order of Commander Zhang, expanded the scope of relief and sent telegrams to various parties seeking relief to benefit the victims. The provincial government received this telegram last night and recorded it as follows: Jilin Provincial Government Honorable Sirs, and to all agencies, organizations, and newspapers: The counties in the western part of our province are located in the lower reaches of the rivers and are low-lying, and are frequently affected by floods. Recently, due to continuous rain and mountain torrents, the rivers have overflowed at the same time, and the dikes have collapsed. After our government sent personnel to investigate and according to reports from various counties, from Suizhong Jin County Yi County Beizhen Panshan Heishan Zhangwu in the west to Xinmin Liaozhong Taian, the area is 600 to 700 miles long and 200 to 300 miles wide, all flooded and turned into a swamp. More than 10,000 people have been drowned, tens of thousands of houses have been washed away, and no less than 400,000 to 500,000 refugees are trapped by water without food or clothing. When the flood suddenly came, they could not escape in time. Some climbed onto roofs and trees, calling for help from afar. Some houses collapsed, and they ended up being companions with the water spirits. Even worse, entire villages were trapped, without food for more than ten days. The road was far and the water was deep, and there was no way to provide relief. As a result, every household became hungry and the whole family died. After the water receded, the disaster victims had no home to return to. They either relied on begging to survive or relied on porridge pots to live. It is unbearable to witness such heartbreaking scenes. Situations like this are difficult to describe in detail. The land affected by the water was covered by sand and can never be cultivated again. This extraordinary disaster is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. We have already ordered all counties to rush to provide emergency relief, and have first allocated funds from the provincial treasury to purchase grain for relief. At the same time, we have organized a Flood Disaster Emergency Relief Association to collect donations. We also hope that your province will allocate 100,000 Jiyang yuan, which has already been distributed in advance. However, the disaster area is vast and there are many refugees. This is just a drop in the bucket. Winter is approaching soon, and winter relief must be planned in advance. Thinking about the future, we are filled with anxiety. In addition to asking the Central Government and other provinces for relief, we hope that public and private parties in your province, either out of neighborly friendship or out of concern for our hometown, will generously donate and raise funds as soon as possible to benefit the victims. We urgently telegraph and respectfully hope for your consideration. Liaoning Provincial Government (Official Seal). After receiving the telegram, Chairman Zhang plans to</p>
<p>Convene a meeting of all parties within the next few days to discuss the method. (August 31st)</p>

<p>County Government Meeting Minutes: The county government held its 73rd county government meeting yesterday to discuss the following matters: (1) The Public Security Bureau previously submitted a case requesting that the township and district chiefs pay for police rice and subsidies. The district chiefs' meeting resolved that the housing police donation has been increased and cannot be increased any further. The motion for reconsideration was resolved: The county government still orders the districts to seriously rectify the housing police miscellaneous donations to offset the costs. If there is a shortfall, it will be supplemented from the district's business expenses. (1) Previously, in accordance with the provincial promulgation of the Rules for District Chief's Offices, the district administrative expenses were reduced. It was decided that it will be implemented from September. According to the difficulties reported by various district members, the original budget will still be issued. How should this be handled? It was decided that the statements made by various districts are true. The county government will issue 60% of the original budget and submit it to the department for approval. Before instructions are received, the original budget will be temporarily paid. (1) The First District Office submitted a request to divert half of the funds from the fine item to subsidize the Public Security Bureau's Second Branch Office for housing repair expenses. Should this be approved? It was decided that fines for violations of police regulations have been approved for purchasing clothing. Whether the repair expenses are real, the county should inspect and send the repair bills to the Public Security Bureau for review, and then the matter will be reviewed.</p>
<p>Change of Post Office Director: Duan Changkang, the director of the local post office branch, has been in office for more than ten years.

<p>Youth Distributes Reactionary Leaflets: Yesterday (7th), someone in Xiaojia Lane in the city distributed reactionary leaflets. The second sub-station in charge reported this to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched patrol officer Wang Du of the bicycle team to inspect pedestrians in the area around Guanqian Street together with Patrol Officer You of the Second District. At 1:00 PM, a youth was found at Fangqiao, holding a bunch of Suzhou Youth League leaflets of the Chinese Communist Party. He was immediately taken to the bureau for interrogation. The youth spoke with a Jiangyin accent and was only in his twenties.</p>

<p>A Rascal Gang Beats a Woman to Death: At Maojingbang outside the North Gate of Xiyi, there lived a Jiangbei man named Bao Degao, who worked as a tailor. He lived with his mother, Dou Cai Shi, 43 years old. The two of them worked diligently to make a living. At the end of last month, a local rascal named Zhang Sanqi extorted money from Degao. Degao immediately asked his cousin, Pu Minghong, to step forward to reason with Zhang. As a result of the negotiation, Degao agreed to pay Zhang twenty yuan, first paying twelve yuan, and then wrote an IOU for the remaining eight yuan, stating that the monthly interest rate was seven percent. On the fifth of this month, Zhang Sanqi went to demand the outstanding payment. Degao had already fled to avoid him, so Zhang demanded payment from Dou Cai Shi. Cai Shi refused to acknowledge the debt, saying that her son had been frightened away and was nowhere to be found. Zhang left in anger, and soon after led five or six of his gang to the Bao home. They grabbed Cai Shi and beat her severely, causing her to fall to the ground injured. The rascals then scattered. After being beaten, Cai Shi's injuries worsened day by day, and she eventually died yesterday. The Tutheng of Tian Si Tu reported the matter to the county for an autopsy. The autopsy revealed minor injuries sustained before death, and that she had died of illness. After the autopsy, Pu Minghong, the deceased's cousin, was instructed to prepare for the coffin and burial. Meanwhile, the county government dispatched police to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice.</p>
<p>Petition to Revoke Tobacco Bond Denied: The Second Special Tax Bureau stationed in Xiyi previously received instructions from the Translation Bureau, ordering it to collect two percent of Tobacco Warehouse Bonds along with the seven taxes on cotton, coal, paper, silk, woven goods, bamboo, and wood, with a deadline for remittance to the province. After receiving the order, Director Wang Shou Peng immediately complied. Recently, the County Chamber of Commerce reported that various businesses considered the collection of bonds along with taxes by the Special Bureau to be akin to coercion and requested the province to revoke the order, citing past precedent. After receiving the report, the bureau immediately submitted petitions to the Ministry of Finance and the Special Commissioner of Finance for Jiangsu Province, requesting revocation to appease the public and avoid criticism. The County Chamber of Commerce received an order from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the collection of two percent of rolled tobacco bonds was decided by the Executive Yuan and must be complied with. The request for revocation was denied because the matter concerned a unified plan. After receiving the order, the Chamber immediately forwarded it to various relevant industries for notification. Furthermore, at the end of last month, the Wuxi General Tax Office also received instructions from the Department of Finance, ordering it to solicit one million yuan in customs bonds. After receiving the order, Director Wang Xinru immediately convened a meeting of all branch directors in the county to discuss the matter. It was decided to first advance one-quarter of the amount, totaling two thousand five hundred yuan, to the province for urgent use. Meanwhile, the various branches solicited contributions from passing boatmen, regardless of the amount, ranging from a few cents to several yuan, and issued temporary receipts issued by the Special Commissioner of Finance, which would be exchanged for formal customs bonds in the future, with a monthly interest rate of eight percent and repayment in installments.</p>
<p>Collapse Injures Many in Nanyan Market: In Hongsheng Li, Eleventh District (Nanyan Market), there were four flat houses along the river, built by a local resident. Two of the houses were rented to Hua Wenqing to open a small teahouse, and the other two were rented to Chen Jingen to set up a fresh fish stall. Both businesses were doing well. However, at nine o'clock on the morning of the previous day, the houses suddenly collapsed completely due to years of disrepair. At that time, there were dozens of villagers sipping tea in the teahouse. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and knew something was wrong. Most of them hid under the tables, so they only suffered minor injuries. However, elderly people and children were unable to escape and were injured by the collapse. Among them, Zhou Qifeng and his wife (both over sixty years old) from Nanqian Township were the most seriously injured and their lives were in danger. Chen Jingen's wife (25 years old), who was seven months pregnant, was also trapped and seriously injured. Her husband, Jingen, took her to the hospital for treatment by boat.</p>
<p>Apprentice Who Was Fascinated by Swordsmen Returns to Wuxi: Jia Shixing, Fan Futang, and Lv Duansheng, apprentices at the Xinji Rice Shop outside the North Gate of the town in Sanliqiao, usually enjoyed reading martial arts novels and admired swordsmen. They secretly agreed to leave on the pretext of visiting teachers on the twenty-sixth of last month. Later, the families found the three in Beijing. Only one of them, Lv Duansheng, was determined to join the army and could not be brought back. His father, Lv Jinkui, was extremely anxious and recently asked his friend to speak to Chen, the company commander of the Seventh Infantry Company affiliated with the teacher, requesting that he be allowed to return.

<p>Police Detectives Seek to Arrest Gang Leader, Fail: The Shanghai Public Security Bureau recently apprehended bandits involved in a kidnapping case, who confessed that the leader was Tang Lao Er, and that his base was in Lijiatang, Hengshanqiao, Changzhou. The bureau dispatched Captain Qi Haitian of the Arrest Team, along with detectives and a kidnap victim as an informant, to Changzhou on the 4th. They submitted a document to the county government, and County Magistrate Wu immediately sent Police Squad Leader Zhao Yongfu and his police to assist in the arrest. They arrived at the kidnappers' base in Lijiatang and found newly built, very solid houses. Inside, they found cartridge cases, bullets, photographs, and other items. Tang's wife was at home, but Tang and his concubine had gone to Taiping Temple in Lulu to offer prayers. The police detectives immediately rushed to Taiping Temple, but the bandit had received a message from his accomplices and had already fled by boat to Taihu Lake. Only Tang's mother-in-law, Wang Chen Shi, was left at the temple. The police detectives suspected that the monk Daoming was harboring bandits and took Wang Chen Shi and Daoming into custody on the 6th and sent them to the county after a preliminary hearing.</p>
<p>Customs Bonds, Initial Remittance of 35,000 Yuan: The Wuyi County Government Finance Bureau was ordered to raise 160,000 yuan in customs bonds, to be remitted to the provincial government in three installments, and to use this year's grain tax remittance as collateral.

<p>Robbery and Murder Occur in Luhe Town: More than ten bandits armed with pistols arrived in Luhe Town, on the border of Changshu and Taicang, the night before last. They first broke into the Cui family's hotel, robbing all the silver jewelry and abducting five people, including Cui Zhongzhi and his family relatives. They then went to the Ma family's sundries store to rob items and abduct an employee. In the Cao family's Beijing goods store, in addition to searching for property, they also abducted an employee. After the robbery, the bandits abducted the hostages. However, Cui Zhongzhi was old and had difficulty walking, so several bandits had to help him along. When they passed the Zhou Ming Bridge in Changshu (five miles from Luhe), the bandits saw that the tofu shop owned by Chen Xing was open and dragged Chen Xing inside to help them carry the hostages. When they reached the Jiepai River, they had each of the hostages board a boat and escape towards the Yangtze River. At that time, they also planned to abduct Chen Xing, but Chen resisted. The bandits then stabbed Chen Xing in the top of the head, throat, and temples four times with a knife and threw him into the river. The district office reported the matter to the county for an autopsy. Because of the hot weather and the decaying state of the body, the family requested an exemption from the autopsy. Chen Xing's elderly mother, aged 83, depended on Chen for a living, and his wife and children are all currently in a state of mental disarray. The whereabouts of the abducted hostages are still unknown.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Organizes Big Sword Team: Recently, the Public Security Bureau of the town saw that banditry in the countryside was not peaceful.

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>they fired several shots in advance, piercing the main gate. The corps members were all asleep. Upon hearing the gunshots, they immediately got up, armed with live ammunition, and went out through the back door, engaging the bandits. Both sides exchanged dozens of shots. The aquatic public security police arrived upon hearing the alarm and surrounded the bandits. The bandits, realizing the situation was unfavorable, fled to the southwest. The commercial corps did not pursue them due to the darkness of the night. No one was injured on either side in this battle. Although the town was shocked, fortunately there was no loss.</p>
<p>Impersonating Inspectors, Extorting Money, Apprehended: There is a Fuyi Shun incense shop outside the West Gate of this city. The other day, a man surnamed Sun, impersonating an inspector from the military police inspection office, went to the shop and claimed to be searching for prohibited items. The shop owner asked to see his official documents, and Sun immediately brought out a certain patrol leader to vouch for him. He then extorted several hundred yuan and left. A certain inspector from the inspection office found out, went and apprehended Sun and took him to the office for punishment.</p>
<p>Recovered Wounded Soldiers to Depart for the Capital: All 1,400 wounded and sick soldiers in the Twenty-Seventh Rear Hospital stationed in Yangzhou were checked off and inspected one by one by personnel sent by the Ministry of Military Affairs a few days ago.

<p>Ordering Huainan Merchants to Subscribe to 300,000 in Rolled Cigarette Bonds: The Transportation Envoy received instructions from the Ministry of Finance, ordering Huainan merchants to subscribe to 300,000 in rolled cigarette bonds. He immediately invited the merchants to a meeting to solicit contributions. The merchants, feeling that the subscriptions were too large and they were unable to comply, were mostly hesitant to proceed. Chief Ding repeatedly invited them, but only two or three people came to the office to request exemptions and asked the transportation envoy to forward their difficulties. The Ministry of Finance did not approve and ordered the transportation envoy to strictly urge them to submit the payments. The merchants reluctantly complied, and in addition to the 70,000 yuan already paid, they also sent friends to Shanghai to discuss loan methods with various banks.</p>

Top quality is 12.8 yuan, top medium 11 yuan, standard quality 10.2 yuan, lower medium 9.3 yuan, new tail rice 8.7 yuan. It is also learned that clean, aged high-quality rice is around 15 yuan. However, unscrupulous merchants, citing continuous cloudy and rainy days, falsely claim that supplies are not abundant and have suddenly increased the price by two yuan per stone (unit of measure).</p>
<p>Many Deaths from Dysentery: Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been inconsistent, and the people have been affected by the unhealthy air, causing diseases to proliferate. In recent days, many people have died from dysentery in Yangzhou City.</p>

<p>Aftermath of Banditry in Huainan Salt Reclamation: The Dagang, Huacheng, Hede, Ougeng, and Dashen Cooperative Reclamation Companies south of Sheyang River in Huainan were occupied by bandits. The firearms of the police stationed at each company were all robbed, and the staff and tenants fled completely. On the 6th, representatives of each company held a post-disaster meeting in Nantong to discuss relief measures. Representatives who went to the province to petition reported that the province did not have enough troops to allocate to the reclamation area. It was resolved by public vote that each company would jointly organize a security corps, and 40,000 yuan was immediately raised to be submitted to the province for approval to start operations. At the same time, efforts were made to comfort the refugees, harvest flowers, and cut grass, with the aim of restoring the original situation in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Large Gang of Bandits Loot Two Towns: At 4:15 a.m. on the 7th, 51 bandit boats suddenly arrived at Tianningzhuang Town, located on the border between Jiaxing's northern countryside and Jiashan, and more than 400 bandits landed and looted extensively. All businesses and homes in the town were spared. The water police stationed in the town had been ordered to transfer to another location a few days ago, so when the bandits arrived, it was as if they had entered an empty land. The looting continued until after 10:00 a.m. The bandits then kidnapped Zhou Xuechi and Wang Houzai, owners of kiln households, and Zhou Zipei, owner of the Qinghao clothing store, and headed towards Taozhuang in the northern countryside. When Tianningzhuang Town was being looted, at 6:10 a.m. on the 7th, five more bandit boats arrived at Youchegang Town, about three miles away in Jiaxing County. After the bandits landed, they cut the telephone line connecting Jiaxing, and shot and killed a local security team member. Team leader Dai Hongsheng and Patrol Leader, from the police substation in the town, were arrested and taken aboard the boat, losing their freedom. The bandits then went to the Yuchang, Xinhe, Yufeng rice shops, and Yonglong Sauce Garden, and Dingyuan Pickled Fish Shop to rob (it is estimated that about 1,000 yuan was robbed from Yuchang, several hundred yuan from Xinhe and the residence, several hundred yuan from Yufeng, and about 500 yuan from Yonglong and Dingfeng). At about 8:00 a.m., the bandits released Team Leader Dai and others to the shore and sailed towards Tianningzhuang. In this incident, about 50,000 yuan was robbed from Tianningzhuang and about 4,000 yuan was robbed from Youchegang. After receiving the news, the Jiaxing Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the Water Police District Headquarters dispatched troops to give chase from the Zhiguo warship. At noon, they encountered the bandits near Taozhuang and began fighting. As of press time, the fighting was still intense.</p>

<p>Bandit Boats Spotted in Taozhuang, Dingzha, and Yuhui: The A'shu gang of bandits, have been pursued and suppressed by the Jiahu Bandit Suppression Headquarters, water and land military police in Qitang Baihu and Gaoxu. For the past week, things have been relatively peaceful. Now, they have mixed with the gangs from Haizhou and Henan, creating a significant force. They planned to loot near Xincang, Pinghu, but Jiaxing sent teams to suppress them. On the 5th and 6th, the bandits fled to Xiamudang in Taozhuang, with sixty or seventy boats, more than twenty boats near Dingzha, and more than ten boats in the Nanyedang of Yuhui, hoping to invade a large town in this county. Taozhuang telegraphed the county and Xitang to take appropriate precautions and reported to the Jiahu Bandit Suppression Headquarters to quickly suppress them. The towns in the northern countryside of the county are in a very critical situation. It is also reported that two or three dozen bandit boats have been spotted in Jinze and Luhu in Jiangsu, claiming that they plan to loot Xitang.</p>

<p>News of Replacement of Police Chiefs and Officers in the City: Police chiefs and officers under the Ningbo Public Security Bureau have been replaced by graduates of the police academy, as approved by the Department of Civil Affairs. After the official announcement, Yang Chaoqun, chief of the Second District of Jiangbei, assumed office the day before yesterday. It is now learned that Xu Yu Kuan, the officer of the First Sub-district, and Lu Nian Yang, the officer of the Second Sub-district will assume office today. Du Kui, the officer of the Third Sub-district, will take office on the 7th. Ye Zuo Ping, the officer of the First Sub-district, and Shen Zhi Ming, the officer of the Second Sub-district, have not yet arrived in Ningbo. Although Lou Wen Chao, the officer of the First Sub-district of the Third District, and Jin Ru Song, the officer of the Second Sub-district, have arrived in Ningbo, the date of their assumption is still undetermined. Liu Han Dong, the newly appointed chief of the First District of the city, arrived in Ningbo the day before yesterday. Since Director Mao thought that the chief of the First District had always been concurrently held by the director, he telegraphed the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions. After receiving the telegram, Liu was reassigned to be the chief of the Third District of the city. Liu went to the Third District in Jiangdong yesterday to discuss handover matters with the original Chief Wang. However, the date of officially taking office is still undetermined.</p>
<p>Loan Agreement of 250,000: Due to urgent need for funds, the provincial government planned to borrow 250,000 yuan from the local banking and money industries, and specially sent Zhu Luzhong, director of the Wuxing Unified Donation Bureau, to Ningbo to negotiate. It is learned that Director Zhu hosted a banquet for the leaders of the local banking and money industries at the Commercial Association yesterday (the 5th) at noon, with Mayor Yang, County Magistrate Chen, and standing committee members of the Commercial Association Zhang Xianlu and Yuan Weifu as guests. There were no objections during the discussion on the loan issue and agreement on the loan. However, due to concerns that the collateral would be insufficient, the provincial government was asked to find additional collateral. Director Zhu immediately agreed to go to the province to seek instructions. Regarding interest rates, since the time is short, it may be possible to follow the example of Hangzhou. It is also reported that the contract will be officially signed on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Reports of Bandit Re-Gathering in Yuyao: It is reported that Fei Zhaozhao, the bandit leader of Kan Town, Yuyao, was appointed as the commander of the Twenty-Seventh Army by Zhou Fengqi, and ordered to recruit bandits to disrupt the rear. The bandit purchased firearms, distributed them to his followers, and posted slogans to confuse people. The matter was detected by the local government, which sent troops to suppress them. The bandits fled upon hearing the news. According to reliable sources, the bandits are based in Nijiang Road, as the area is north of the coast and they can take a boat directly to Shanghai in an emergency. Moreover, it is more convenient to communicate with Zhou Fengqi, who lives in Shanghai. It is recently heard that military funds of 10,000 yuan have been remitted, and the bandits are openly placing sentries there. The number of people has reached three or four hundred. Fei's family is hiding on the sea boat, anchored in an uncertain place.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Report on the Participation of the National Private Electricity Industry Association in the World Power Conference (Continued) Li Yanshi Shen Sifang <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>(D) Dr. Atra, a Doctor of Engineering and electrical manufacturer, has extensively researched China's electrical industry and once planned to invest in the development of the electrical industry in Northeast China. Once the situation stabilizes and the government has effective measures to protect people's enterprises, it will not be difficult to realize his plan. He also advocates that the development of China's electrical industry should start with small-scale projects, which is the same as Daed Mai's view. (E) Dr. Siegel, an electrical economist, is an expert in the study of modern electrical economics and has written extensively. He advocates that commercial companies are more economical than government-run companies. The cost is lower, and due to competition among the industry, electricity prices have to be gradually reduced, unlike the extravagance of government-run companies, with large staff, disregarding economy, and often arbitrarily raising electricity prices to make up for the shortage of municipal budgets. Such things have been seen many times in European countries, and if the electrical business is run by the government, it is easily affected by politics and presents an unstable state. The government's most important obligation is to create benefits for the people to enjoy electricity, and strict management and direct control are not suitable. (F) A doctor of law and secretary of the German Employers' Association said that since Germany adopted unemployment insurance and health insurance after the war, the protection of workers can be said to be meticulous, but for every good law, there is a disadvantage that follows. Generally, bad workers often deliberately cause trouble and stop working. Once they obtain an unemployment certificate, they can sit at home and eat. The authenticity of the disease is also not necessarily a fixed standard. They often claim to be sick and do not work, and receive insurance payments to live. The current unemployment in Germany is due to sluggish foreign trade, and the disadvantages of unemployment and disease insurance are also important reasons. (7) Liaison with European academic societies. The rise of a business must have talent to take measures. China has been running schools for decades, and there are more and more people studying electrical engineering and economics management. However, the national electrical industry does not see development. Graduates from domestic and foreign specialized courses often have no opportunity to use their talents, or their studies are not used, or they are absorbed by foreign firms. This situation is most sad. Electrical enterprises cannot shirk their responsibility. The Association has learned from this and advises all colleagues to employ specialized talents as much as possible, and to communicate with students studying abroad, so that they know the current situation of domestic industries and prepare for their return home. Yan and others went to Europe this time and had considerable contact with student associations in the UK, Germany, and France, telling them that the Association humbly introduces various specialized talents, and encouraged them to serve private businesses after returning home. The results were very satisfactory. (8) Liaison with other associations. In addition to joining hands with various electrical industry associations, this trip to Europe also involved the German Oriental Association, the Engineering Society, the Electrical Engineering Society, the Employers' Association, the Standards Committee, as well as the International Electrotechnical Commission, the International Standards Committee, etc., all of which have direct or indirect relationships with the electrical industry, and have been contacted one by one to achieve the effect of mutual assistance. (9) The crisis of overdevelopment of industry in various countries. Yan and others visited industrial factories in various countries, all of which reduced work or stopped altogether due to blocked sales. The Rhine region of Germany is the center of industry, with chimneys like forests, but only half of them are lit. The number of unemployed workers is higher than in other countries. According to recent statistics, one out of every five people is unemployed. This unemployed person is indirectly supplied with life by the other four. Recently, in order to increase trade, the German government tried to reduce costs and ordered the whole country to reduce wages by 7.5%, and the products of each factory were reduced by 4% to compete with other countries. Whether it is effective is still a problem, but it can already see the danger of overdevelopment of industry. If our country does not actively develop agriculture and increase production, but only follows the lead of various industrial countries, it will only lead to death. (10) Sights on the way home. Yan and others spent two months in Europe, and various investigations and liaison work were generally in order. Because the Association's annual meeting was approaching, they had to return home early, taking the Trans-Siberian Railway, taking the opportunity to visit Soviet Russia. They departed from Berlin on the 12th of this month. The day before, Minister Jiang hosted a banquet for Qian Xing. When boarding the train, Minister Zhuang, staff of various embassies, representatives of the Power Conference, the chairman of the Oriental Association, representatives of various industrial factories, the chairman of the German Student Association, and various students all came to the station to see them off. The kindness was appreciable. After boarding the train, they arrived in Moscow on the morning of the 14th, and met with Representative Mo of the Sino-Russian Conference, and briefly inquired about the current situation in Russia, and went to the city to tour. The citizens were jostling and coming and going, all looking like beggars. The so-called national department store, with dozens of buildings, has no goods. Only a few kinds of goods are displayed in the windows, all of which are old goods, and most of them are for foreigners to buy. Domestic people are not allowed to buy without a certificate. Municipal administration is not repaired, waste is abandoned all over the ground, ashes are piled up, and the stench hits the nose. The people are hardworking and enduring, and wearing bad clothes and eating bad food, which is something that people in non-Western civilized countries can accept. From Moscow to Manchuria, for seven days and nights, what I saw along the way was that the vast plains of Siberia have been cultivated and the trees are lush. Animal husbandry is flourishing, which is very different from 20 years ago. All the large forests are harvested by the state and transported to European and Western countries for sale. Every day there are several trains, full of white pine boards and other miscellaneous trees, heading west. On the 21st, they arrived in Manchuria, on the 22nd, they arrived in Harbin, stayed in Harbin for one day, and on the 24th, they arrived in Dalian. From the Sino-Russian border to the Xing'an Mountains, there are no trees and a lack of grains for hundreds of miles. The vast area is barren land, but the soil is as fertile as Siberia. One is completely opened up and the other is abandoned. It is a pity. From Manchuria to Dalian, China takes Changchun as the boundary. The north of Changchun is the sphere of influence of Red Russia, and the south is the sphere of influence of Japan, and Japan is carrying out its colonial policy. What you can see and hear makes you wonder if you are in the three islands of Dongying. Electrical business and other public utilities have fallen into the hands of foreigners. If the people of the country do not catch up quickly, shift their eyes to the Northeast and Northwest, engage in reclamation, and work hard to build, after decades, it will not be our country. The date of the Association's second anniversary is approaching, and I am very happy to reunite with the muscle industry gentlemen and guests from all walks of life. Recalling this day last year, it was the time when the Association was born. Over the past year, it has been hard and difficult to organize internally and promote externally, and it has achieved today. The unity and consistency of the industry is gratifying, and the enthusiastic maintenance of all walks of life is especially grateful. How should we implement and improve in the future, so that the private electrical industry can develop day by day, and advance with the electrical industry of various countries in the world? Yan and others are not talented, and are willing to follow after. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e79">Closing Ceremony of the National Capital Party and Government Agencies' Phonetic Alphabet Training Class <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The closing ceremony of the National Capital Party and Government Agencies' Phonetic Alphabet Training Class was held at the Zhongda Science Museum on the morning of the 6th. More than 250 people attended, including Acting Minister Liu of the Central Propaganda Department, Minister of Education, division chiefs, section chiefs, instructors, and students. At 9 o'clock, the bell rang to start the meeting. Everyone stood in silence, sang the Party song, and performed the ceremony. Chen, Acting Director of the Ministry of Education (Social Education Division), reported on the closing of the meeting. Wu Zhihui was invited to give a speech, but a reply was received stating that he could not attend. Minister Liu of the Central Propaganda Department was invited to attend the meeting for guidance and could come immediately. As for the various preparations before the meeting and the circumstances after the event, the speaker, as Acting Director, has not been in office for long. Section Chief Peng knows the details better. Please ask Section Chief Peng to report. Then Section Chief Peng Baichuan reported that the promotion of the phonetic alphabet was passed by the Second National Education Conference in April of this year, and was reviewed and approved by the 88th Standing Committee Meeting of the Central Committee. The Ministry established the Ministry's Phonetic Alphabet Promotion Committee and issued 25 measures for the promotion of the phonetic alphabet in various provinces and cities, and all parties voluntarily went to do it. At the same time, various agencies sent letters hoping to organize training classes. Therefore, the training class was established. The original training period was from July 28 to September 28, two months. Later, because the Central University scheduled classes to start on September 8, the class hours were increased (the original 32 hours of separate training per group were increased to 46 hours), and the period was shortened to September 6. The training was completed. A total of 251 people from various agencies were sent to the meeting. There were 119 agencies, including 5 departments and committees under the Central Party Department, 1 municipal party department, special party departments, and 9 district party departments, 54 district branch offices, and 50 agencies in political science and law. The participants came from 19 provinces (Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Yunnan, Hunan, Guangdong, Hubei, Anhui, Fujian, Hebei, Jiangxi, Henan, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Sichuan, Rehe, Shaanxi, Mongolia, Shandong) and 3 cities (Hangzhou, Peiping, Nanjing). 80% of the participants scored above 90, 16% scored above 80, and 4% scored below 80. The certificates issued this time only represent the results of the study. It is hoped that they will continue to study constantly. Then, Education Minister Jiang Menglin gave a speech. He first talked about the long history of the phonetic alphabet and the reasons why scholars did not pay attention to it and failed to promote it. Then he said that dialects are separated. If the standard sound of the phonetic alphabet is used to spell and recognize words, although it cannot unify the national language, the pronunciation will be similar and will not be too far apart and completely separated. He also talked about the usefulness of recognizing the phonetic alphabet. One is to help unify the language, and the other is to help popularize education. Everyone studied enthusiastically during the summer vacation. In the future, we will start from the capital to promote it, and popularize education, which will be a great help. He should thank everyone, etc. Then, Acting Minister Liu Yinlu of the Central Propaganda Department gave a speech, saying that Minister Jiang had spoken in detail about the usefulness of the phonetic alphabet, and he would add a little more. He thought that the Chinese nation could not be unified, not only because of the lack of military and political power, but also because of the lack of social power itself. The formation of a nation depends entirely on the natural power of society itself, and the so-called natural power is language and writing. The Netherlands and Germany, and Belgium and France, have many differences because their languages and writings are not exactly the same. Therefore, they have become independent nations. The division and merger of people depends on whether the language and writing can be unified as a measure. With natural power, then borrowing military and political power as a rescue, it is easier to unify. There are many obstacles caused by the lack of transportation and the separation of languages in the country's ethnic groups. If you want to unify language and writing, the phonetic alphabet is a simple method. Therefore, Wu Zhihui advocated it, and the Central Committee decided to promote it, in order to unify language and writing, communicate feelings and thoughts, break down the obstacles to unification, and make the nation survive firmly and have a whole spirit. Whether it is internal or external, everything can be arranged freely. I hope that everyone will be responsible for the unification work, starting from the promotion of the phonetic alphabet. Instructor Lu Yiyan summarized the main points of the speeches of Minister Jiang and Minister Liu, hoping that everyone would work hard to continue their studies, maintain what they have learned, and benefit the general public. Photo taken and meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e82">The Municipal Government Strives for the Provincial Slaughter Tax and the Jurisdiction of Shanghai Municipal Secondary Schools <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government and the Jiangsu Provincial Government are competing for the provincial and municipal slaughter tax and the Shanghai Secondary School and other schools should be placed under the jurisdiction of the city. Although the scope of authority has been divided by the administrative meeting, there are still disputes between the two sides regarding the date of transfer and takeover. Recently, the Municipal Government submitted another document to the Executive Yuan, stating that the case was submitted to the Executive Yuan for instructions. The instructions No. 2700 of the Executive Yuan stated, "Previously, the Municipal Government submitted a report stating that the Finance and Education Bureaus requested that Shanghai Secondary School and other schools be taken over immediately, or that the takeover be postponed for half a year. From January 20, the city's education tax rights and education rights should be completely handed over to the city for takeover." When the case reached the Yuan, it was sent to the Ministry of Education for consideration. Now, according to the Ministry's reply, "The case has been consulted with the Jiangsu Provincial Government for verification. Now, with the approval of the consultation reply, after investigating this case, the reasons were stated earlier and a request was made to maintain the original case, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Since it has not been long since then, it is not appropriate to change the decision rashly." The Ministry of Education has presented its views and is awaiting approval. After receiving this, the municipal government immediately forwarded the instructions to the Finance and Education Bureaus for their information. Now, according to the Education Bureau's report, "The issue of the management of the city's slaughter tax and the issue of the jurisdiction of Shanghai Secondary School and the Experimental Primary School were previously approved by the 60th meeting of the Executive Yuan. The measures proposed by the three ministers, Jiang, Wang, and Kong, changed the final decision due to the Jiangsu Provincial Government's one-sided request for reconsideration. The two bureaus have repeatedly submitted reports to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education, requesting that the original decision be adhered to and that efforts be made to adhere to the original decision. It has been investigated that since the slaughter tax is revenue in the city, it should naturally belong to the city and be managed by the city. It is clearly stated in the minutes of the provincial and municipal division of governance rights that the status quo will be maintained temporarily. Negotiations have been held repeatedly over the years, but the transfer has not been made. As for Shanghai Secondary School and other schools, they are located within the city's boundaries. If they are managed by the province for a long time, the city's education administration will be divided, and the entire city's administrative region will be destroyed. The three ministers, Jiang, Kong, and Wang, have seen this and proposed to transfer them to the jurisdiction of the city and set the transfer time at the end of the 18th year. From the beginning of the takeover to the transfer time, there are four months of preparation time. However, the province said that due to the jurisdiction of educational institutions and the burden of expenses, there were many difficulties at the end of the 18th year, and it was unable to comply for a while, requesting reconsideration. The inability to comply was at the end of the 18th year, and now it is the 19th year, and the difficult time has passed. As for saying that it has not been long since then and it is not appropriate to change the decision rashly, the first time the Executive Yuan approved the measures proposed by the three ministers, Jiang, Wang, and Kong, it has not been long since then, and a request was made to reconsider and change the final decision. There is a precedent to follow, and the so-called considerable period of time is requested again for implementation. It is not clear when it can be said to be considerable. The matter concerns the city's administrative authority, and the speaker dares not to be bothered and submits another report to the superiors for verification. It is requested that the slaughter tax and other issues of Shanghai Secondary School be handled according to the original decision and returned to the jurisdiction of the city in order to clarify the functions and powers.</p>

Then Qin Fengxiang reported on the Jiangsu Obligatory Education Joint Office's measures to commemorate Yuan Gong, and a special issue was published in the Local Education Monthly. Wang Fenggu reported that Baoshan was planning to select a compulsory education memorial area in the urban area or Liuhang area and was investigating and contacting it. It was resolved to add Jiang Xiaojian, Cai Boren, Li Shoupeng, and Guo Yanmo as members of the association. It was resolved that after the location was determined, the association would convene a committee for the memorial area on September 14 to discuss and determine the implementation measures. It was resolved that a memorial service would be held tentatively at 2 pm on September 28 or October 5 at the Lujiabang Workers' Education Center, and a meeting would be held next Sunday (September 14) to decide. As for initiating memorial groups, contact them separately and publish notices in the newspaper, and report at the next meeting. It was also resolved that a committee for preparing the memorial service and the obligatory education memorial area committee would be held at the Vocational Education Society at 3 pm on September 14. In addition to notifying the committee members to attend, representatives from the memorial groups were also invited to attend. As for the news reported in the newspaper the day before that Yuan's residence was scheduled to be mourned on the 11th of this month, it was not true and would probably be held in mid-November.</p>
<h3 id="e84">News from China Radio Engineering School <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>China Radio Engineering School was founded by Yu Qiaqing and other major merchants in Shanghai. The teaching and management are serious and strict, and the instruments and machinery are fully equipped. Students practice communication and reporting. A Westerner from the French radio station, Mr. Qian Shufu, is hired to guide the students at the school every day, teaching them the technology of communication and reporting on the one hand, and teaching them the principles of engineering on the other hand, so that the students can definitely undertake important work on the radio station after graduation. Graduates have been introduced by the school one after another and have obtained considerable occupations. Some have served as radio operators on major ships, and some have served as deputy engineers in various companies and radio stations. Last month, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recruited radio operators and selected 15 people. Students from the school accounted for half of them. This autumn, the first examination for enrollment recruited more than 50 people. The second examination is scheduled for September 14. Recently, students from other provinces and cities have registered for the examination, which is unusually . The school's engineering and telecommunications departments have a quota of 100 students, and both men and women are accepted. The school is located at 855 Mengnala Road.</p>

The principals and teachers hired have been recorded in previous reports. A school affairs meeting was held at 4 pm on the 5th of this month. 60 teachers and staff members from the two schools attended the meeting. A photo was taken before the meeting to commemorate the event. Then the school affairs meeting was held. First, Principal Wu Lian delivered a speech (hoping that all teachers and staff would work together to make the school affairs flourish). Then, Academic Director Wang Bu Mai expressed his opinions (teachers should not only teach lessons in class, but also pay attention to students' behavior). Then, Training Director Yuan Yuyu proposed (advocating the inherent old morality of our country and training students to develop self-government ability). Zheng Luo, the vice director of school affairs of the women's school, gave a speech (girls must advocate thrift, prohibit gaudy makeup, and must wear blue cloth school uniforms uniformly, and advocated strict management. All girls from other provinces and cities are not allowed to live outside, and even those whose homes are in the city are only allowed to ask for leave on Saturdays every week in order to rectify the school spirit). Finally, Physical Education Director Liu Wenxiao advocated (popularizing sports and promoting morning exercises). Then all the teachers and staff members successively expressed their opinions and discussed school affairs. The meeting broke up after dinner at 6 o'clock. It was also heard that the school was scheduled to start classes officially today.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Three World Records <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>One Mile Race Walk ···· 8 minutes 14 and 2/5 seconds</p>
<p>Half Mile Run ···· 2 minutes 18 and 1/5 seconds</p>
<p>Two Hundred Yard Run ···· 25 and 1/5 seconds</p>
<p>(London Dispatch, August 17th) The British Women's Amateur Athletic Association held a meet at Stamford Bridge on August 16th. Mrs. Howarth of the Middle-Aged Women's Sports Association, the world record holder for the one-mile race walk, had just married on August 10th. Although still enjoying the sweetness of her honeymoon, she still participated in the competition, which was also the last time in her life that she showed her skills in the one-mile race walk on the athletic field. Mrs. Howarth led in half of the one-mile race, but in the end, she was overtaken by Mrs. Mason, also of the Middle-Aged Women's Sports Association, who won the championship, defeating Mrs. Howarth by a distance of twenty-five yards. The time was recorded as 8 minutes, 14 and 2/5 seconds, which is a new world record, breaking Mrs. Howarth's previous world record of 8 minutes and 12 seconds.</p>
<p>Recently, at another athletic meet at Stamford Bridge, Mrs. Howarth completed a one-mile race walk in a time of 8 minutes and 12 seconds, originally a new world record. However, the track was not measured after the race, so it could not be recognized, which is a great pity. (If a result is to be recognized as a world record, the track must be re-measured immediately after the race to show caution.) Mrs. Mason's walking style was very beautiful this time, and more than three thousand spectators cheered greatly.</p>
<p>Another new world record was Miss Lyne's half-mile run, with a time of 2 minutes, 18 and 1/5 seconds, breaking Miss Cutlack's record of 2 minutes and 24 seconds. Miss Lyne took the lead from the start and never fell behind. Although the swift Miss Stone worked hard, she was never able to take first place. The results of each event are as follows:</p>
<p>Shot Put (1) Mrs. Outwaite, 29 feet, 1 and 1/4 inches, (2) Miss Burfitt, 28 feet, 4 and 3/4 inches, (3) Miss Phillips, 27 feet, 1 and 1/2 inches.</p>

<h3 id="e93">Japan's Sexist Practices <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Today, the islands of Japan have become one of the world's civilized countries. However, the sexist practices in its society are even worse than in our country. Recently, a friend who has lived in Japan for a long time returned and told me many stories of gender inequality in Japan. I will record a few of them to tell the readers.</p>
<p>In Japanese elementary schools, there are always more male teachers than female teachers. In Tokyo, for example, male graduates of teacher training colleges in their first year of service earn 55 yuan a month, while women only earn 45 yuan. With the same qualifications and the same ability, and the duties are the same, and the effort is the same, the unequal treatment is so great. The sexism is obvious. As for the subsidies received by teacher training students while studying at school, women also receive less than men. Women only receive 12 yuan and 90 cents per month, while men receive 13 yuan and 50 cents.</p>
<p>The education sector, which should have high levels of knowledge, looks down on women as described above. Then it is easy to imagine other fields. Company employees and shop assistants have much lower pay than men. Men always say that women are incompetent and only worthy of being raised. Women also see themselves as weak and do not dare to resist. My friend's daughter graduated from university last summer. She heard that a certain organization had a secretarial position open, with a monthly salary of 80 yuan. After much effort, she finally got the job. On the day she took office, the head of the organization told her all the precautions for her duties. When he mentioned her monthly salary, it was only 60 yuan. The woman said, "Why is it suddenly reduced by 20 yuan?" The head said, "The figure of 80 yuan is for men. Do you, a weak woman, also want to compete with men for equality?" The woman was extremely angry when she heard this. She resigned and went home. When she got home, she went to her bedroom and sobbed. Her parents quickly asked her what was wrong. The woman sobbed and told them. The father said, "Sexism has been around since ancient times. How can you not know your limits and try to compete with others?" The woman became even more angry and felt so hopeless that she tried to end her life with three feet of white silk that evening. Fortunately, she was discovered and a tragedy was averted. As of now, my friend has returned to his home country, and the woman is still living at home, unwilling to set foot in society.</p>
<p>Sexism is even more severe in rural Japan. In a family, the husband is like the emperor of heaven, and the wife is like a servant. When the husband returns from outside, the wife must greet him with a smile, relieve him of his burden, and offer him tea and cigarettes, as if welcoming a distinguished guest. The husband receives it with arrogance and does not say a word of thanks. When he returns in the evening, the wife must also prepare his favorite foods. The husband eats and the wife serves him. She responds to his every call. Even an extremely poor husband, who works as a hired laborer during the day, treats his wife like an animal in the evening, and her status is very high.</p>
<h3 id="e94">My Opinion on Suicide Prevention <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Lu</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of young people committing suicide has been increasing every day. Even if it is caused by environmental pressure, it is still a shame that young people do not know how to fight. The life solutions mentioned in Free Talk by Tian Xuwo Sheng and another gentleman are very well-intentioned. After all, the difficulties of life are the main cause of suicide. It must be known that in this world, customs are decadent, the cost of living is high, and it is difficult to find work. The strong become bandits, and the weak become pessimistic and degenerate. Both tend towards suicide. Some have weak wills and are degenerate and romantic, and end up taking their own lives. Others have been unemployed for a long time, their families are heavily burdened, they have no one to turn to, and they cannot borrow money, so they resort to suicide. Still others are disappointed in love or fail in school, become immersed in degenerate literature, and are fascinated by biased and heretical ideas. All of these are secondary causes of suicide. Once the causes are identified, the remedies can be clarified. The increasing level of social and economic progress is a trend of the world and cannot be avoided. If society is extravagant and indulgent, this is a gradual trend of evil. If one can strengthen one's will, there is no need to be affected. For example, if one always reads erotic novels and then suddenly reads the works of the Qin and Han dynasties, one will find the erotic novels shallow and unreadable. Therefore, people only seek the new, and I only seek the old. There is great pleasure in this. No matter how evil the social trends are, one will not be affected at all. As for the difficulties of life, one should work hard to increase income and be frugal to reduce expenses, study to find employment, and be honest to establish oneself. No matter how urgent the world changes, one should not change my words. Why should one resort to suicide? Lao Tzu said, "I have a great worry, which is that I have a body. If I had no body, what would I have to worry about?" Mountain Valley Elder said, "The bodies of all living beings are the same as the void. Where can worries find a place to rest?" If one's body is the same as the void and one regards one's body as nothing, then worries and gains and losses cannot enter. Love and money are even more irrelevant to my body. The true meaning of life is that, in the big picture, it benefits the country, and in the small picture, it benefits society. The highest is to establish virtue, the next is to establish merit, and the next is to establish words. One should maintain a spirit of struggle and an optimistic attitude. The world's eccentric Napoleon said, "The word 'difficult' exists only in the dictionary of fools." Conan Doyle said, "Life moves forward only. Why look back?" These are all things that young people should take as their guiding principles. Alas, today is a chaotic world. I do not want young people to learn from Lord Xinling's wine and women, nor do I want them to learn from the Jin people's crazy behavior. If there is no other way, they should learn from Yuanming and Yaofu. In addition, the prohibition of degenerate novels, the promotion of birth control, and the dissemination of correct views on life are all important strategies for saving the situation that those who care about the world should pay attention to. Alas, suicide is the act of a coward. Good young people, hurry up and work hard!</p>

<p>— Xu Bi Bo</p>
<p>The Wu Men Xing She [Poetry Society] was established on the Qixi Festival [Double Seventh Festival] of this year, marking its tenth anniversary. In recent years, members have been running around in all directions due to livelihood issues. Those remaining in Suzhou do not even account for four-tenths. Therefore, the monthly gatherings that were once customary have faded away. Only the Qixi Festival, as the anniversary of its establishment, sees a gathering without fail. This year marks the tenth anniversary, so we should add some embellishments to commemorate it. However, fellow members are preoccupied with worldly affairs. Those from distant places have not yet prepared to return, and even the ten or so members residing in Shanghai have not arrived. It's truly disappointing.</p>
<p>The banquet that evening was held at Mingdao Mansion. Mingdao has a bad leg. His old illness recurred in early summer, causing him great pain. Even after being treated by dozens of Chinese and Western doctors, he has not improved. He sits all day, living in solitude and without joy. The doctors also warned him not to overthink, but the requests for manuscripts from various bookstores and newspapers piled up, which he couldn't fulfill. Yanhqiao temporarily took over his teaching position at Zhenhua School. Moreover, due to business reasons, his friend at Youlian urged him to quickly finish drafting volumes five and six of "The Female Knight-Errant of Desolate Rivers". I couldn't bear to see him in that state, but as I was under orders, I had to relay the message. He politely replied that he would prioritize that when he had time. He was rather somber when he said that. Yanhqiao, due to his aversion to heat, spends his days in a bamboo forest from summer to autumn. He says that when he's deeply absorbed, he's not only oblivious to the heat, but he also loses track of time and place. He's truly in a state of abandon. This man's luck is shining brightly; every time he plays mahjong, he wins. [A metaphor where "South" represents winning]. This is in stark contrast to my recent streak of losses.</p>
<p>Xiao Qing has recently developed a fondness for traditional Chinese painting. She's learning flower painting from the renowned painter Chen Huian, and she's quickly gaining recognition for surpassing her teacher. This past month, she painted four silk fan pages, each seven inches square. One of them was purchased by an Englishman named Small for sixteen shillings, which was equivalent to thirteen yuan, eight jiao, and four fen in Chinese silver dollars at the time. Perhaps "Small" is a case of mutual affection from a young age? The other three were purchased by an American woman, Miss Henry, for ten US dollars each, which was equivalent to thirty-five Chinese silver dollars. As a newly emerging painter, she's already selling to foreigners. Her future is bright, and her income will surely be much greater than that of writing detective novels.</p>
<p>Mianyun is a collector of fans. He has amassed no less than five hundred fan leaves and faces. Many of them are exquisite. Recently, he planned to commission a fan painting from a famous artist, willing to spend thirty dollars. However, he's worried that the artist is too temperamental and might not deliver the painting for years. Yanhqiao is well-acquainted with the painter, so he promised to urge the artist. Mianyun was overjoyed.</p>
<p>Zhanlu is calm and indifferent by nature, and he avoids conflict. Readers are constantly urging him to continue writing his "Lake and Sea Heroes". He only responds with a subtle smile. Peiyu has resigned from his position at the Shanghai school and taken a job as an editor at the World Book Company in Suzhou. That day, Sun Ji from Jun held a fan page and asked members of Xing Lü [Star Companion magazine] to sign it on behalf of a friend. Initially, I assumed there would be many signatures, but only eight members attended the gathering. So, his friend only received eight signatures.</p>
<p>Among the members in Suzhou who were absent, I heard that Yinqiu declined due to illness. Junbo has been preoccupied with the problem of the "Mysterious View Temple Wall", worrying about raising funds day and night. He had no time to attend. Jihe is lost in the bamboo forest. As for the absence of Elder Fengyin, I don't know why.</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Internal Politics of Post-War Poland (1) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Li Liu Zeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>It has been a decade since Poland was restored. From the surface, it appears that the more than twenty-eight million people of the country are united under the banner of the republic. The nation seems to be completely unified. However, upon closer examination, we find that internal politics are not entirely consistent. To illustrate with a minor example, the procedures for Poles to obtain identity cards vary depending on their place of birth. Some require a birth certificate issued by the mayor, while others require a baptismal certificate from a priest. The situation in the East and West is vastly different.</p>
<p>However, if we consider that Poland's true independence only began in 1918, then this diversity is not surprising. Poland was divided for 124 years, under the domination of the three great powers of Russia, Germany, and Austria. Its inherent culture was almost completely destroyed. As a result of the partition, both spiritually and materially, it changed gradually in three different environments, causing Poland to form three different regions, losing the commonalities of a single ancestral country. At the beginning of the Great War, the governments of Germany and Austria jointly ordered Marshal Pilsudski to form the Polish Legions to assist Germany and Austria. Meanwhile, countless Polish soldiers joined the Russian army to fight, under the command of Grand Duke Nicholas. Nicholas also promised Polish autonomy. After the retreat of the Russian army, the German army occupied the entire territory of Poland, giving Poland the appearance of unity. In 1916, in order to get Poland to join the war, the Germans even allowed the Poles to celebrate their national day and recognized Polish independence. However, this independence was nominal only until the end of the Great War. Poland gained true freedom from the day of the armistice. Before that, Poles joined the Allied Powers to attack the Central Powers, or joined the Allied Powers to attack the Allies in order to fight for the independence of their homeland. They killed each other, subject to the whims of fate. Only at this time did they achieve their common goal: to unite and complete Poland's independence.</p>
<p>At this time, everything in Poland's internal politics was in its infancy. The Polish People's Militia was the beginning of the Polish army. The Warsaw City Guard was the beginning of the Polish police. The Council of Regency, established in 1917, was the beginning of the Polish government. (This Council of Regency transferred power to Marshal Pilsudski on November 14, 1918.) At this time, the organization of the new Poland was nothing more than this. Internally, it had to fight against famine, bandits, and various disasters caused by war and subjugation. Externally, the national borders were not yet defined, and it had to defend against the encroachment of strong neighbors. The weight of its responsibilities far exceeded its capabilities.</p>

<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>A Visit to the Palace of Versailles (7) Versailles</p>
<p>The modern European art scene has a generation of Diabolism painters. They also seek to depict all the dark aspects, expressing the excitement of evil. There's nothing strange about this. They are simply trying to thoroughly understand human nature, just like gourmets who love to eat unusual flavors—like Chinese people's love of stinky fermented bean curd, preserved eggs, and spicy pickled vegetables; Japanese people's love of takuan pickles; and Westerners' love of cheese. If someone cannot appreciate that peculiar taste, they cannot discuss China, Japan, or the West. I kept talking to Mr. Chen all the way, running from the Versailles palace gardens outwards. When we walked out of the grand square behind the palace, the clouds in the sky were scattered by the wind. A long rainbow rose from the rooftops on the left and fell into the groves on the right, forming a 180-degree arc. Its brilliant and ever-changing colors astonished and bewildered us. Ah, this is our glory, that fleeting glory!</p>
<p>After visiting the Palace of Versailles, I often think that such a vast and magnificent garden, such a splendid and solemn palace, could only be created by a monarch with genius and a hedonistic nature. It could only be done under the autocratic rule of a monarch who believed, "I am the state." Indeed, during the reigns of Louis XIV and Louis XV, the French monarchy had reached its peak, and the power of autocracy was at its zenith. The extravagance of court life at that time is also enough to amaze us.</p>
<p>The palace alone employed 4,000 people, with 9,005 Swiss guards protecting the gates—the guards of the French court at that time were all Swiss, due to their unwavering loyalty. The royal family comprised more than 2,000 people, totaling 16,000. The annual expenditure was 20 million. The palace maids' food and drink cost 8 million a year. If we include occasional rewards and embezzled funds, palace officials received salaries of hundreds but actually obtained thousands. The palace maids were numerous and had no duties, spending their days on adornment. The royal kitchen cost 1.46 million each year and employed 295 chefs. The head chef earned 34,000 a year, and the wine expenses alone amounted to 4 million. Fish and bird expenses were 400,000. The palace had 4,000 horses, 220 carriages, and 1,500 strong men in the royal guard, costing 3 million. Actors, grooms, and hunting dogs all lived near the palace. The hunting grounds, strictly forbidden to the public, surrounded the palace for 120 *li*. The king and nobles hunted rabbits, pigs, deer, and countless other animals at will, spending 480,000 a year. From 1755 to 1769, in the span of 14 years, there were 144 boar hunts, 131 deer hunts, 266 rabbit and sheep hunts, and 25 fowl hunts, each lasting five or three days. There were also twelve detached palaces, costing over 1 million a year, with repair expenses of over 800,000. Whenever the king went hunting or on excursions, from nobles and palace attendants to servants and grooms, everyone followed. The daily expenses for accompanying people alone amounted to 100,000. In 14 years, besides hunting, the king made 234 tours. The king's private income was 200 million a year, and a ring for the queen was worth 3 million. Close attendants received annual salaries of 13 million. Such extravagance! Flipping through the pages of our own imperial history, only Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty and Emperor Ming of the Tang Dynasty can be compared to this.</p>
<p>Louis XIV was indeed a monarch of genius. He not only indulged in personal pleasure but also seized power through pleasure. He worked daily to weaken the feudal lords and suppress the nobility, turning feudal holdings into mere honorary titles. He lavishly decorated the palaces and indulged in hunting, entertainment, and sensual pleasures, thereby gathering the feudal lords at the palace, holding endless nights of revelry, valuing idle talk, and disdaining official duties. He subtly eroded their ambition to resist orders based on their territories, effectively destroying hundreds of thousands of feudal states in one fell swoop, achieving the unification of his royal power, and ushering in the glorious era of the French monarchy. However, while the hidden dangers of feudalism were eliminated, the suffering of the people was not alleviated. At that time, the nobles regarded the people as mere grass, trampling on them without the slightest compassion, extracting their wealth and sucking their blood. The oppression of autocracy had reached its extreme. However, the pressure of autocracy could only destroy the thoughts of ordinary people but could not stop the resistance of thinkers. Therefore, a group of great thinkers emerged in France at that time, serving as the driving force to resist this autocratic government, ultimately leading to the French Revolution.</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance: Last Week's Soaring Market</p>
<p>Gold Market Fluctuates Unsteadily Throughout the Week: Last week, the gold market rebounded, presenting a soaring trend, albeit with occasional ups and downs. Hovering around 560 *taels*, with daily fluctuations of six to seven *taels*, the bewildered state of affairs seemed unstoppable. This was mainly due to the large-scale sale of silver bars by Citibank and India, which stimulated speculators to take advantage of the activity. However, rumors spread, and overseas telegrams were contradictory, causing confusion in the industry, with both buying and selling creating a complex situation. Starting from the beginning of the week, the market turned upward, surpassing the 60 *tael* mark. The subsequent rise and fall were unpredictable, and the market briefly entered a state of decline. Towards the weekend, the market recovered, showing excellent momentum. On September 3 (Wednesday), the price reached 567.8 *taels*, but on September 5 (Friday), it suddenly plummeted to 552.4 *taels*. This week saw a total fluctuation of 15.4 *taels*. However, large silver bars unexpectedly lengthened by 3.125, and the advance bill was extended by one and a half marks, which was contrary to the auction price, indicating a divergent trend. In short, the gold market remained unstable, but those with long positions in the industry fared better. As for the daily gold auction price, the initial decrease was slightly over 60 *taels*, but ultimately only decreased by less than 50 *taels*. The spot market has seen mediocre sales recently, with prices approximately 22 to 23 *taels* higher than the term auction. All September receipts that have not yet been rolled over were settled with public orders (cash) starting from the first of this month. It is said that the amount was enormous, approximately 20,000 *taels*. The daily progress of the past week is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Full Week Results in a Gain of 10.02 *Taels*: Since September 1 (the beginning of the week), British silver continued to rise, American silver remained unchanged, and advance bills remained steady, but internal conditions tightened, resulting in a rebound after repeated declines in the gold market. The opening price for October was an immediate increase to 555.3 *taels*. Subsequently, buying activity picked up, gradually rising by over 4 *taels*. Yuan Cheng, Yong Zuo, Tai Tai, Kang Run, and others all made purchases. In the afternoon, the price broke through the 60 *tael* mark, closing at 59.5 *taels*. The next day, large bars fell back, advance bills remained unchanged, and the internal market fluctuated slightly, ultimately appearing weak. The auction price softened slightly, with the front market briefly falling to slightly over 55 *taels*, but the rise and fall only amounted to 3.3 or 3.4 *taels*. Afterwards, the market suddenly turned upward, breaking through the 60 *tael* mark, due to rumors circulating in the market that the United States and India were selling large quantities of silver bars. Consequently, major players such as Fu Chang, Cui Da, Tai Da, and Decheng scrambled to buy. The price then retreated by 2 *taels* due to selling by Xin Heng and others. Wednesday saw a sudden surge, with major players pursuing purchases. Although silver bars lengthened, the price of silver remained unchanged, and the foreign exchange market was stable. The price abruptly broke out of the 60 *tael* range. In the afternoon, the market showed even greater momentum due to the shrinking of Indian remittances and rumors of continued silver sales from India, which boosted confidence and caused the price to soar to 67.8 *taels*. Subsequently, the price sharply decreased by 2 *taels*, resulting in a total fluctuation of over 10 *taels* that day. The following day, large bars fell back, but advance bills loosened, putting pressure on the gold market. This was due to a Reuters report stating that India denied selling silver bars, causing confidence to rapidly soften and the price to fall by 7 *taels*, breaking below the 60 *tael* mark. On Friday, large bars lengthened again, the foreign exchange market, which had been unchanged for many days, suddenly increased by one and a half marks. Furthermore, due to a Reuters report stating that the United States had not sold silver but had instead made purchases, industry sentiment was dampened. Zhi Feng, Yong Bing, Xing, and others successively sold, causing the price to fall to 52.4 *taels* in the morning. The momentum of long positions subsequently weakened, and the market softened slightly in the afternoon. On Saturday, the silver market increased slightly and was not shaken. Furthermore, the European market appeared soft, especially the United States, which seemed to have slightly sold silver. Consequently, the Shanghai foreign exchange market trended higher, and the price of gold once again exceeded the 60 *tael* mark, reaching 64 *taels*. Yuan Mao, Yong Yuan Cheng, Yong Fu Chang, and goods companies all made purchases, and no one dared to take short positions. Ultimately, the price was calculated at 62.7 *taels*, an increase of 10.02 *taels* compared to the previous Saturday, August 30. There is no concern about a potential decline in the future due to the approaching rollover date. The high and low prices of British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as advance bills and auction prices, are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Securities: Bond Prices Increase Sharply Last Week <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Turnover of 67.7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, the local securities market saw quiet spot trading in various public bonds, with a total turnover of only 83,500 yuan. This included 26,300 yuan in Disbandment bonds, 25,000 yuan in Troop Reduction bonds, 17,000 yuan in Customs bonds, and only 6-7,000 yuan each in Reorganization and Post-War bonds. Continued Finance bonds saw only 1,000 yuan traded, and other bonds saw no transactions. Futures trading was more active than the previous week, and the market atmosphere was lively. Both Troop Reduction and Disbandment bonds saw large-scale trading daily. Customs bonds were also more active than the previous week, while Post-War bonds were quiet. Other bonds remained scarce. Currently, market trading has gradually concentrated on the three bonds of Troop Reduction, Disbandment, and Customs, while others have lost their former position in the market. Daily transactions reached 13 million on Monday and Thursday-Friday and over 10 million on Wednesday. Tuesday and Saturday were quieter, with approximately 9 million yuan each. The total turnover was 67,748,500 yuan, an increase of over 15 million compared to the previous week. This included 11,910,000 for September Disbandment bonds, 10,490,000 for October Disbandment bonds, 10,245,000 for September Troop Reduction bonds, 15,245,000 for October Troop Reduction bonds, 6,775,000 for September Customs bonds, 5,960,000 for October Customs bonds, 1,555,000 for September Post-War bonds, 1,835,000 for October Post-War bonds, 585,000 for September Reorganization bonds, 330,000 for October Reorganization bonds, 435,000 for September 96 bonds, and 520,000 for October 96 bonds. There were no transactions in Continued 25 or Continued Rolling bonds in October, with approximately 280,000 yuan each traded for September. Finance bonds traded 10,000 yuan, and 1,035,000 yuan was traded in 19-year Cigarette bonds. As for the price fluctuations of each bond, although the overall trend was stable throughout the week, with no major rises or falls daily, the good military news from the front and the optimistic situation led to positive market sentiment and active investment purchases. Consequently, buyers consistently dominated, and bond prices steadily trended upward. Except for slight weakness on the weekend and Monday, prices rose on all other days. As a result, compared to the previous week, only Reorganization, Finance, and 96 Continued Rolling bonds saw minimal changes, while Troop Reduction bonds soared by 4 yuan, Customs and Continued 25 bonds increased by over 3 yuan, and Disbandment and Post-War bonds also increased by several yuan. The upward trend was quite strong. Observing the bond market situation, if the environment does not change, a slight stabilization can be expected. The following is a statistical table of the high and low prices and price fluctuations of each bond for the week (in yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e101">Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Increases Slightly Last Week <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Spot Sales Extremely Quiet... Inventory Increases</p>
<p>The yarn market showed a rather sluggish trend at the beginning of the week. The domestic war continued, sales were obstructed, and the purchasing power of all parties was weak, resulting in a gradual increase in the inventory of yarn in Shanghai. According to a survey by Japanese merchants, there were approximately 130,000 to 140,000 bales. With such a huge amount, it was increasingly difficult for the market to recover. Moreover, a large portion of the inventory was unsalable. There had been no procurement from the Yangtze River area for a long time, and rampant banditry and military changes in the north made the outlook for yarn sales extremely pessimistic. In South China, most of the goods shipped by the Guangdong merchants the other day were still at their destination, making the current demand particularly quiet. In addition, the overseas cotton yarn market was still in decline, putting even greater pressure on the market. The Guangdong merchants, who had been most enthusiastic the other day, had been vigorously searching for futures in the market and absorbing large quantities. However, given the poor environment and sluggish spot sales, the general trend was to release the purchased volume. Consequently, the market trended downwards. However, a certain manufacturer with a long position remained unmoved. The Japanese merchants and some others needed to see 50 *taels* for customs clearance. According to statistics, the total volume purchased by various guilds that day was 6,285 bales, with 2,035 bales purchased by fellow merchants. The prices for Japanese yarn fell by 1-2 *taels*. Auction participants initially released long positions, causing market prices to fall. Later, Ruida made up for 6-7,000 bales, and the market slightly rebounded. As a result, the prices for all months fell to a low point of 1-2.3 *qian* compared to the previous week, with distant months reaching 151.1 *taels*. The total turnover for the week was 74,600 bales. Although Osaka's three-item production has been reduced significantly, the upward momentum remains lacking, and the overall trend is volatile. The breakdown of bales purchased by each guild is recorded below:</p>
<p>Guild Bales Guangdong 965 Guild Bales Sichuan 2,570</p>
<p>Xuzhou 450 Tianjin 380 Luzhou 90 Shantou 90</p>

<h3 id="e102">Cotton Market Remains Weak Last Week <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The overall situation of the cotton market remained weak and sluggish. Since the overseas cotton market still could not be optimistic, sellers were extremely active at the beginning of the week. In previous years, before the new cotton entered the market, Japanese merchants would have purchased large quantities of distant-month new cotton for storage. However, this year, because there was a surplus of raw materials worldwide and Indian cotton prices were extremely cheap, various factories had absorbed as much as possible. It was said that they had enough to meet their needs for five or six months, and this factory also had such a large amount in storage. Moreover, the price of new cotton was high, so there was naturally no need to purchase it. Therefore, the quietness of the new cotton trade was rare in history. Consequently, most manufacturers viewed the market as bearish. Shortly thereafter, the weather turned unfavorable, with alternating periods of cloudiness and sunshine. As a result, buyers seized the opportunity to purchase and increase their holdings. General cotton merchants debated extensively, and for a time, there was a strong upward trend. However, the global situation remained pessimistic, and new buyers were still lacking. The market fell again. The rainy weather for several days naturally caused damage, but fortunately, the rain did not last long, and there was no wind. It was said that the damage in Hubei was still light. The market suddenly strengthened at the weekend because American cotton weekly reports had a bullish tone, predicting a decrease in the second production estimate. Ruida, a major player, had a significant amount of short-covering, tightening the market. The price rose by four or five *qian* in one day. American cotton prices had reached the lowest level in ten years. However, consumption could not be stimulated in a short period, and the future remained uncertain. The outlook for local cotton was extremely bullish, but the demand from various factories remained unchanged. In addition, the yarn market was weak. The Han Standard prices on the exchange increased by three or four *qian* for each month compared to the previous week due to the unfavorable weather. The total turnover for the week was 223,700 *dan* of American cotton. The spot cotton business in the market was quite quiet, with various factories purchasing 9,360 *dan* and firms purchasing 4,080 *dan* of Yao cotton. 6,646 bales of Yao cotton arrived. The bales purchased by each manufacturer and firm are recorded below:</p>
<p>Manufacturer Purchase Highest Price Lowest Price Transaction Volume Deadline</p>
<p>Huoji Cotton 33.25 33.00 600 bales Spot delivery to factory</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton was mixed as it awaited the government report. It first weakened due to Southern sales, then strengthened due to purchasing by fellow traders. Futures fell 9-13 points, spot fell 10 points, English cotton futures rose 11-12 points, and spot rose 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose 20 points. Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but softened due to local short-covering. Pingguoer and Aomula rose 1 rupee, and Bairoxi rose 2 rupees, as recorded in the original telegram (dated the 6th).</p>

<h3 id="e104">Grain: Downriver Rice Market Turns Weak After Sunny Weather <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the inland supply came from over ten sources. Market sales trended sluggish. The inventory downriver was estimated at over thirty sources. The North Guild had decent purchasing interest in broken *geng* rice, and the high price barely held its original level. Medium grades were generally weaker by one or two *jiao*. The common overall price was around 10.70 yuan. Since the weather cleared, market sentiment has gradually become bearish, because the new rice in the four districts will soon be harvested and enter the market, and the future supply is expected to become abundant. Therefore, cargo owners were eager to sell, and the market atmosphere became unfavorable. Dongxin *geng* rice continued to arrive one after another, and various factories showed a strong interest in sales, and the price slightly recovered by half a yuan, opening at around 18 yuan. The situation for thin-husked rice was flat. The goods arriving in Shanghai were extremely minimal. The price standard was similar to that of *geng* rice, and the overall trend was also flat and weak. The supply of new-crop *kejian* rice was abundant, and the cost of this cargo was extremely low. According to recent telegrams, the cost in Jiangsu was no more than 13 yuan. Therefore, the profit of merchants transporting this time was no less than that of foreign rice this spring. So once the market trended soft yesterday, it immediately shortened by two or three *jiao*. The top grade was only around 14 yuan. The evaluation and price reduction for middle grades was even greater, and the market was about to loosen. As for new *canjian* rice, it was available at times and not available at others. Although new rice had been seen, it was still difficult to connect and could only arrive in small quantities. The price of each grade followed the trends of foreign rice and *geng* and *kejian* rice. The white rice market was sluggish, and both the restaurant and brewing markets were watching. The overall market was not very prosperous, with only middle grades shortening by a small amount.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, not much rice arrived from downriver. The purchasing interests of this street varied. Top-grade *geng* rice was in short supply and had few arrivals, so any occasional arrivals saw excellent sales, and the situation was brisk. However, common old *geng* rice from Suzhou and other places was rarely inquired about. Although the supply was thin, the market sentiment softened greatly due to the clearing weather, so the market shortened by about two *jiao*. Dongxin *geng* rice and new *geng* rice from the south route were weak by two or three *jiao*, and the price ranged from 17.5 to 18 yuan. The stockpiles of thin-husked rice from the producing areas were sold off in batches, because the new cargo was about to arrive abundantly, so the selling atmosphere was brisk, and the price also trended weak by half a *qian*. However, this cargo has not been much in Shanghai recently, and most of the supply is still on the way, so a sharp reduction still had to wait a little longer. Yin yuan exchange was rare and sales were light, and the situation was generally flat.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Sugar Market: 3,500 Bags of Coarse Grain White Sugar Discharged <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, news from the sugar market production area indicated that due to it being Sunday, there were no telegrams. The Municipal Council market planning session revealed that the buying interest in Dutch sugar, specifically Grade 24 coarse grain white sugar, remained quiet. Ordinary goods were priced at 8.2 to 8.21 taels, with few transactions. New goods, those with coarse grains and high color, were priced up to 8.23 taels, but attracted even less attention. The market for medium grain white sugar remained the same as before, with sluggish activity. Japanese sugar with the "M" mark was traded at 8.15 taels, "YT" mark at 8.1 taels, "HS" mark at 8.05 taels, and "YP" mark at 8.1 taels. Transactions were dwindling. Although prices did not rise or fall compared to the previous day, the market felt particularly listless. Various foreign firms were selling off long-term Dutch sugar coarse grain white sugar. China Merchants sold 3,500 bags of coarse grain white sugar for October shipment at a price of 6.05 Dutch currency. As a result, shipments were fully opened. They offered to sell November shipments for 6 Dutch currency, but the firms' interests were weaker, leading to no transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Silk and Tea: Ningfeng Rayon Sales Brisk, Supply Exhausted <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Later Batch of Goods Offered at 107.5 Taels</p>
<p>Rayon is currently in a period of brisk sales, with demand from various manufacturers increasing. This is because all sectors welcome rayon products. Currently, ordinary goods are selling for 110.2 taels per 100 pounds, which is more popular than higher-end goods priced at 140-150 taels. The Ningfeng No. 4 blue "Ning" brand is in high demand from manufacturers and sells very well in the market. Currently, customers have searched and bought up all stock, and the supply in Shanghai is about to be exhausted. Consequently, asking prices have soared, rising by more than ten taels. (Previously, the market price was only 112.5 taels per 100 pounds.) Now, the asking price is 107.5 taels, and it is said that there is still an empty market.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Last Week's Silk Market Extremely Sluggish <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Silk Sold at Low Prices, Chinese Silk Uninquired</p>
<p>European Sales Extremely Weak, Chinese Merchants Generally Pessimistic</p>
<p>Last week, silk transactions by foreign firms in this port were nearly exhausted. Since the economic downturn in European and American markets, silk mills have been trying to reduce costs and have no interest in purchasing expensive raw materials. The consumption of rayon has surged. Japanese silk merchants, due to an oversupply of cocoons and a thick stock of silk, took the opportunity to sell at low prices. Shanghai Chinese silk merchants complained that the prices were too high, and almost no one inquired. Spot and future silk in New York and Lyon saw few transactions. New autumn cocoons from Hangzhou and Shaoxing in Zhejiang Province have entered the market, and a good harvest is expected. However, silk prices are expected to be high, comparable to spring cocoons. The Jiaxing and Huzhou regions are also starting silkworm rearing, and cocoon purchasing personnel from various silk mills have begun to depart. Last week, European sales of spot silk were extremely weak, and Chinese silk merchants were generally pessimistic. Overseas silk prices continued to weaken, with prices quoted but no actual sales. The following is a list of Chinese silk market prices at the end of last week in European and American markets (New York price per pound, unit: US dollars; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: French francs):</p>

<p>The trade in East White Iron was very brisk yesterday. Therefore, various inland river and Yangtze groups have some embellishments, and the market situation is gradually seeing an upward trend due to the strong momentum of popularity. Currently, the estimated price for a 37-inch sheet is 1.15 taels, and for a 36-inch sheet, it is 0.95 taels. It is heard that 37-inch circulating goods are extremely scarce, so the market sentiment is exceptionally strong. Therefore, the price may rise further.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Commemorating the Premier's First Uprising Tomorrow <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>丨The Municipal Executive Committee Holds a Commemorative Meeting丨</p>
<p>Location: Republic Road, Gonghe Cinema</p>
<p>Time: September 9th, 9:00 AM</p>
<p>Tomorrow (the 9th) marks the anniversary of the Premier's first uprising. The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department has actively prepared in advance and specifically set 9:00 AM on that morning to convene people from all walks of life for a commemorative meeting. Party departments at all levels, various agencies, and organizations must send four representatives to participate. Details have been reported in this newspaper. The meeting location was originally set at the Xiaoximen Youth Propaganda Group but has now been changed to the Gonghe Cinema on Republic Road. A letter to all comrades will also be issued, stating that thirty-six years ago today, the revolutionary party led by the Premier launched its first uprising in Guangzhou. More than seventy revolutionary comrades sacrificed their blood. Although the revolutionary plan, carefully managed for many years, was completely exposed due to this failure, this unprecedented great undertaking spread to countries at home and abroad, shaking the numb Chinese nation and awakening the sleeping people of the whole country.</p>
<h3 id="e120">The Understanding and Efforts Due for the Commemoration of (September 9th) <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>1.  In the autumn of 1894 of the Gregorian calendar, corresponding to the 20th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the Sino-Japanese War erupted. The Qing forces suffered repeated defeats, the navy was completely annihilated, and the defensive barriers were entirely lost. Beijing and Tianjin were in imminent danger, and the people's hearts were filled with extreme indignation. The Premier, unwilling to see the nation in peril and the people suffering, along with three or five comrades including Deng Yin'nan, returned from overseas to Hong Kong. In the spring of the following year, they established the Revive China Society, planning to seize Guangzhou as a revolutionary base. The uprising was scheduled for September 9th but was unfortunately leaked, and firearms were seized by the Guangzhou customs. Lu Haodong, Qiu Si, and Zhu Guiquan, who were the first to sacrifice themselves for the revolution, died as a result. The Premier had no choice but to flee to Japan with Zheng Shiliang. This was the Premier's first uprising.</p>
<p>2.  The Premier's first uprising held extremely significant meaning in terms of national, political, and social aspects. The revolutionary embryo of the Three Principles of the People gradually developed with this uprising. In the national aspect, the Premier witnessed the corruption of the Qing government and the nation's peril, and felt the revitalization and prosperity of advanced countries. He knew that without striving for a national movement, there was no way to save China from danger and destruction. In the aspect of people's rights, he deeply resented the oppression suffered by the entire nation, both internally from autocracy and externally from the trampling of the great powers. He knew that without overthrowing the fatuous and autocratic Qing government, it would be impossible to reform politics and promote civil rights. In the aspect of people's livelihood, imperialists, relying on their political advantages as a backing for economic aggression, had almost completely destroyed China's agricultural economy. The Qing government only knew how to oppress the people and did not know how to seek remedies. Therefore, unless this fatuous and corrupt government was overthrown, the problem of the people's livelihood would be impossible to resolve. Thus, the Premier's first uprising already contained the spirit of the three major revolutions: nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood.</p>
<p>3.  Based on the above, in commemorating the Premier's first uprising, (1) we must recognize that the Premier's first uprising was the first endeavor of the Chinese nation to promote national spirit, restore national freedom, and save the nation from destruction; (2) we must recognize that the Premier's first uprising was the beginning of the national revolution, not a struggle for power by heroes and chivalrous figures of a feudal society (taking over the dynasty), and that it opened a new era in Chinese history; (3) we must recognize that the Premier's first uprising was a great revolution to save the people from suffering and was launched out of an unwillingness to sit idly by and watch the people's livelihoods be cut off.</p>
<p>4.  In commemorating the Premier's first uprising, the efforts we should make are: (1) We must overthrow imperialism and abolish unequal treaties because the Premier's first uprising was against the aggression and oppression of imperialists, and the reason why imperialists can invade and oppress our nation is because they use unequal treaties as a shield. (2) We must eliminate the remnants of feudalism and strive for revolutionary construction. Since the overthrow of the Qing Dynasty, warlords within the country have been constantly fighting for power, and the corruption of politics and the suffering of the people's livelihood are even worse than in the Qing Dynasty. In the fifteenth year, our party launched the Northern Expedition, relying on the efforts of the officers and soldiers and the support of the people, and unified the country in less than three years. Unexpectedly, new and old warlords rebelled one after another. The Gui faction and Tang rebels were just put down when Yan Feng and Wang rebels colluded with each other to cause chaos in Beiping and colluded with communist bandits to ravage Hunan and Jiangxi and poison the people. Therefore, in commemorating the Premier's first uprising, we should continue the revolutionary spirit of the Premier's first uprising, support the central government, assist in suppressing the rebellion, thoroughly annihilate the counter-revolutionary forces of Feng, Wang, etc., and permanently consolidate the foundation of peaceful unification, thereby realizing the Premier's legacy of saving the country and the people.</p>
<p>Slogans: (1) To commemorate (September 9th), we must abide by the Premier's teachings. (2) To commemorate (September 9th), we must overthrow imperialism. (3) To commemorate (September 9th), we must abolish all unequal treaties. (4) To commemorate (September 9th), we must strive for political tutelage, promote civil rights, and consolidate the foundation of democratic governance. (5) To commemorate (September 9th), we must promote unification, develop production, and solve the problem of people's livelihood. (6) Overthrow Feng, Wang, and other rebels who betray the party and harm the country and the people. (7) Overthrow the Communist Party, the Reorganization Clique, and the Western Hills Conference faction. (8) Long live the success of the National Revolution! (9) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! (10) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters of the Chinese Kuomintang.  In the history of the Chinese Revolution, [the September 9th Uprising] opened a new epoch. We analyze the causes and consequences of this event to give our comrades a simple report. As a result of the modern industrial revolution and political changes, brutal imperialism has extended its aggressive iron fist from Europe to the entire world. Significant events include the partitioning of Africa, the occupation of Australia, the destruction of India, and the annexation of small countries in Southeast Asia and the islands of Southeast Asia. Among countries with colored people outside of the white race of Europe, except for Japan, which was spared from danger due to the Meiji Restoration, no other country was not gradually weakening or disappearing. In this situation, China's domestic politics were mediocre, and the Manchu Qing's harshness was unbearable for the people. Moreover, economically and politically, China was dominated by imperialist powers. In addition, after strengthening itself, Japan also followed the European powers and launched attacks on the Asian continent. The Chinese nation was surrounded on all sides and was on the verge of destruction day by day. However, the state of the country was like this,</p>
<p>those in power were still ignorant and foolish, holding the attitude of "rather give to foreign friends than to domestic slaves." The general public was still under double oppression and did not dare to express even a groan. At that time, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier, was in this agricultural feudal society that had been left for thousands of years, and which was also a nation that deeply loved peace and was weak in resistance. Every day he heard slogans of "worshiping emperors" and "respecting the sacred." It was not only difficult to stir up the rage of revolution, but it was also difficult to arouse the sentiment of revolution. However, the Premier always wanted to shout the slogans of "overthrow autocracy" and "establish a republic" to promote revolution in this muddled society, regardless of all high pressure and intimidation, and regardless of all criticism and ridicule. He not only advocated revolution but also put it into practice, doing things that the world had never done before. As a result, the great feat of the first uprising was created. Although this event failed because of the exposure of the transport of weapons, the tide of revolution has since surged and cannot be contained. Shi Jianru's bombing of the Governor-General's Office of Guangdong and Guangxi, Huang Kecqiang's uprising in southern Hunan, Xu Xilin and Qiu Jin's uprisings in the Yangtze River, as well as the battles of Huizhou, Chaozhou, Guangzhou Huanghuagang, Qinlian Zhennanguan Xiaosihukou, and even the success of the Xinhai Revolution, one after another, were all inspired by the spirit of the Premier's first uprising. Without the fact of the Premier's first uprising, there would have been no successive and continuous revolutionary movements, let alone the success of Xinhai. Even the fact that our party has what it has today may have been facilitated by the first uprising. Comrades, we can know that the Premier was not a rich man. He had no money. He was not a feudal warlord. He had no men and horses or weapons. All he had was a strong and resolute, indomitable spirit, and a compassionate and broad personality that embraced everything. The martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the first uprising, such as Lu Haodong, Zhu Guijin, Qiu Si, and more than seventy other comrades, had the heroic revolutionary act of sacrificing themselves to be loyal to their cause. We absolutely recognize that the Premier's first uprising was the first endeavor of the Chinese nation to promote national spirit, restore national freedom, and save the nation from destruction. The Premier's first uprising was a revolutionary movement to promote civil rights and transform politics. The Premier's first uprising was a revolutionary strategy to solve economic problems in a Chinese society without the rudiments of capitalism, so as to achieve a situation where the people were adequately nourished. Now the Premier has passed away. The Republic of China, which was left behind by the first uprising, is even worse than the Manchu Qing Dynasty because of the domestic warlords' competition for power, political corruption, and the people's livelihood. In the fifteenth year, our party inherited the Premier's legacy and launched the Northern Expedition. For three years, it unified China. However, although the old warlords collapsed, new warlords rebelled one after another. Tang, Gui, Feng, and Yan successively raised troops. Wang Jingwei, a hypocrite who repeatedly changed his mind and called himself a follower of the Premier, sold his personality in order to develop his personal leadership and control desires, (recognized the enemy as his father), and now stumbles into the door of Yan Xishan, the local emperor of Shanxi (wagging his tail and begging for mercy) (respectfully listening to his holy instructions). He also put together a group of bored politicians, frustrated bureaucrats, and Western Hills Conference members who undermined the party's discipline, colluded with communist party greedy and unprincipled reorganization cliques, and held an enlarged meeting in the style of a "post-disaster meeting" in an attempt to subvert the party's orthodoxy. He also instigated communist bandits to ravage Hunan and Jiangxi, endanger our party and the country, and poison the people. All kinds of crimes are difficult to describe. As for Wang Jingwei's past acts of rebelling against the party and the country, they were already very absurd. Comrades, your understanding of him is very clear. Because he is good at flowery words and pretends to be famous, young people with weaker wills are unknowingly anesthetized by him, and think that he does not choose means to achieve his goals, and that his feelings are sincere and he should be forgiven. However, if we look at the fallacies that Wang Jingwei released this time in Beiping, what he said about (political supremacy in agreement), (party affairs supremacy in public), what (promote the National Assembly), (popular movements should aim to assist local autonomy), (cancel the slogan of ruling the country by the party during the period of political tutelage), and admit (political societies of other political parties), etc., are so absurd that they cannot be added to. Wang Jingwei wanted to please the warlords, so there is no need to discuss it, but when we look back on the Premier's history of revolutionary struggle for more than forty years, and the earnest advice of the entire party's comrades, especially in today's anniversary of the first uprising, we cannot even try to understand him. The Communist Party destroyed our party. First, they wanted to destroy the history of our party. They once said, (the blood shed before the thirteenth year) (was all animal blood). Their insult to our party has reached the extreme. However, Wang Jingwei then echoed it. He said, (the party members before the thirteenth year were not revolutionary parties). This kind of outrageous words, he insulted the Premier and insulted the martyrs, is unforgivable. In the middle of the first uprising, recalling the martyrs who sacrificed for the party, Mr. Lu Haodong, Zhu Guiquan, Qiu Si, we should feel how they killed themselves to become benevolent, and follow the spirit of loyalty to the party and the country, to support the central government, lead the people, and declare war on Wang Jingwei, the rebel who betrayed the party and the country and insulted the martyrs. Comrades, the National Revolution has reached a new and at the same time the most serious period, because the reactionary forces, fearing that the revolution will succeed and have no place to accommodate themselves, are making their last struggle. Imperialists also want to take the opportunity to attack. When we commemorate the Premier's first uprising, we should deeply understand the Premier's will, eliminate the remnants of feudalism, strive for revolutionary construction, abolish unequal treaties, and overthrow imperialism, in order to consolidate the foundation of peaceful unification forever and realize the Premier's legacy of saving the country and the people.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Citywide Curfew Yesterday <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Order Remained Quiet and Normal</p>
<p>Yesterday was the commemorative day of the September Seventh Incident. The Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, Yuan Liang, had received an order from the Songhu Garrison Command to implement a special curfew, similar to the May 1st arrangements. After receiving the order, Director Yuan immediately instructed the district and team officers and police officers under his jurisdiction to deploy three shifts of guards at key locations within the territory, strictly enforcing security. He also instructed all inspectors and investigators from the bureau to go to various districts and stations to intensify inspection patrols. No incidents occurred. The prevention measures are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department, considering Nanjing Road to be a critical location, increased the deployment of Chinese and foreign patrol officers on the streets yesterday morning. Security was tight in an invisible manner. At around 10:00 AM, several dozen men near the intersection of Nanjing Road and Shanxi Road shouted slogans and distributed leaflets. They were dispersed by the arresting officers, and the Laozha Police Station detained one person.</p>
<p>The French Concession General Police Department's General Inspector Fei announced a special curfew starting at 8:00 AM yesterday. In addition to ordering all the heads of the police stations under its jurisdiction to increase the deployment of Western police officers, leading Chinese and Vietnamese police officers in teams to set off for strict patrols, they also ordered a large number of Western police officers to each lead five or six Chinese and Vietnamese police officers to the intersections of various roads on the border between the Chinese and French concessions to choose key areas for deployment. All the iron gates at Xieqiao, Ximen, Nanyang Bridge, and the area around Minguo Road were locked tightly, leaving only small doors on both sides of the sidewalk for passage. At the intersection of West Xinquiao Street, Zilaihuo Street, East Xinquiao Street, Zhengjia Muqiao Street, Mofang Street, Tianzhutang Street, and other locations on Aiduya Road, barbed wire frames were placed across the road, leaving only gaps for vehicles to pass. All the plainclothes detectives were also dispatched, patrolling in teams, strictly investigating and inspecting. In addition, the Great World Amusement Park was ordered to suspend performances during the day, and the iron gates were tightly closed until 7:00 PM in the evening, when ticket sales began.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, military and police protection was quite thorough. Starting at 6:00 AM, the Songhu Garrison Command ordered the 26th Regiment infantry patrol team and the motor vehicle patrol team of the Fifth Division to patrol back and forth at key locations along the Chinese and French concessions, strictly enforcing security. In addition to the extra patrols by the stations in each district, the Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent security teams in cars to patrol the main roads in conjunction with the military police. Male and female investigators from the Inspectorate also collaborated with the station police in each district to inspect anyone with suspicious appearances. At 7:00 PM, passwords were issued, and all Chinese businesses along Fahua Minguo Road closed their doors and locked up before 9:00 PM. Electric lights were dim, and the scene was unusually solemn. It was said that traffic was completely cut off late at 12:00 AM.</p>
<p>Zhabei: In Zhabei, in addition to the extra shifts of police officers yesterday, traffic was not cut off.</p>
<p>West Shanghai: Ren, the district chief of the Sixth District of Caojiadu, announced a special curfew yesterday. In addition to issuing orders to all the police stations under his jurisdiction to increase the number of shifts and patrols, he also ordered Inspector Xu to lead all the head police and police officers in teams to set off and patrol back and forth on Bailinan Road, Jifei'er Road, Laobosen Road, and Kangnaotuo Road. Special attention was paid to the vicinity of various factories. In other areas, such as Wujiaochang, additional police officers were deployed. In addition, Liu Shaoqing, the leader of the detective team, led the detectives to conduct strict inspections in shifts. If there was anything suspicious, it had to be inspected once.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rice and Grain Price Stabilization Committee yesterday sent separate letters to each member urging them to submit donation books. The letter stated, "Our committee previously stated that running the price stabilization program required a large amount of funds. If we do not widely gather the strength of the masses, it will be difficult to overcome this obstacle. We previously requested the Social Affairs Bureau to invite you to be a member of our committee to raise funds and attached donation books to request your solicitation. Since the commencement of operations, calculations show that the deficits are not small, and the donations received are still difficult to compensate. Now that the end is not far off, we kindly request your committee members to quickly solicit donations to meet the urgent needs. We hope that you will submit the donations you have raised along with the donation books by September 10th. If there are any donors who have not paid, please indicate the donor's name, donation amount, and address so that we can send personnel to collect."</p>

<p>The Secretariat of the Municipal Party Committee of this city sent a letter to the Third District Party Committee yesterday, requesting that it negotiate with Shuji School to borrow a portion of the auditorium to serve as a special area for the sale of price-stabilized rice. After receiving the letter, the Third District Party Committee considered the matter to be related to relieving the common people and immediately sent a letter to Shuji School, agreeing to the loan. It also sent a letter to the Municipal Secretariat for investigation and reference. Yesterday's report that the Municipal Party Committee instructed the Third District Party Committee to borrow it as requested was a false rumor. Industrial and Commercial Visit Bureau</p>
<h3 id="e125">Opinions on Promoting Domestic Goods <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>First, It is Necessary to Elucidate the Principles of Production</p>
<p>Compile Textbooks on Domestic Goods Production</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Visit Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that in order to persuade citizens to use domestic goods, it seems appropriate to collect teaching materials in geography and natural science subjects in primary and secondary school textbooks, classify and compile them, in order to cultivate the habit of citizens loving and using domestic goods. It has submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, requesting the Ministry of Education to review and handle it. The original text of the Bureau is recorded as follows: It is believed that to restore social customs, we rely on the power of education to remind us, and advocating the use of domestic goods is especially helpful for cultivating the spirit of rectitude. The way our country has established itself since ancient times, what is called the six treasuries and three affairs, is nothing more than following the constant track of producing more and consuming less, so as to use production to relieve national needs, and to teach the people about local products, which coincides with the Premier's advocacy of the Principle of People's Livelihood. Since the eastward expansion of European civilization, our compatriots have been so fascinated by material civilization that they have almost abandoned the good methods and intentions of producing more and consuming less in our country. All four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation compete to use imported goods. At its extreme, even superior American goods and substitutes for domestic products are ignored. Recently, although the government has issued a clear order that service personnel in all agencies use domestic goods as a model for the people, who knows that although the order is grand, listening to it is finally indifferent.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>The officials in the agencies are still like this, and the general society is even more predictable. This advocacy is followed by that, and a prairie fire ensues. The upper class influences the lower class, and it is like the wind blowing on the grass. However, at this time when it is difficult to reverse the situation, we must consider a method of silent transformation. We have checked the textbooks of various primary and secondary schools in various countries, and geography textbooks and natural science textbooks are compiled with detailed descriptions of the local products of the country, so that children can learn about the way to love and use domestic goods and save money. Our country has a vast territory and abundant resources, and the local products of each province are diverse and abundant. Although the degree of industrialization has not yet been developed for a while, the original famous products have not been promoted and developed. If we can, from the educational aspect, order various bookstores to collect and compile all domestic goods production businesses into secondary school textbooks and promote them, so that children can learn about them and rely on their perceptions to cultivate a habit of loving and using domestic goods. Although the efforts are small, the results will be great. The Bureau has always done its best to advocate and promote the advocacy of domestic goods in publications. Recently, we have carefully discussed with teachers and made a contribution to our humble knowledge. We have submitted it to you for your listening. If it is adopted, please consult with the Ministry of Education for review. The reason for collecting domestic goods production and local products in textbooks, so as to achieve the effect of enlightening cultivation, is it appropriate? We hereby respectfully submit it to you for your review and implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Shanghai South District Defense Corps Inspected Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Sun Baorong's Address</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Shanghai District Defense Corps, since it was ordered to be reorganized, has completed its registration and was inspected at the Nanshi Stadium at 2:00 PM yesterday. Sun Baorong, Chairman of the Rectification Committee, personally went to the venue to inspect each team. After the inspection, he gave an address, the words of which are as follows:</p>
<p>In the Defense Corps, there are corps commanders, corps deputy commanders, team leaders, platoon leaders, and squad leaders. It seems that the ranks are divided a lot, but the Defense Corps is an armed group organized by the people to defend their own places. Therefore, although the ranks are divided, the corps commander and the corps members are no different from family fathers and sons. I am the standing member of the Rectification Committee, and also one of the Defense Corps members, so in terms of rank, I am an official, and in terms of the corps, it is like a family talking. So I believe that today's words are very kind and very sincere. If you listen to my words and do what I say, you will probably not be wrong. Why does the Defense Corps need to be reorganized and inspected? Why didn't it need to be reorganized and inspected in the past, but now it needs to be reorganized and inspected? There is a reason for this. In the past, the Nanshi Defense Corps was called the First Corps, the Beishi was called the Second Corps, and Pudong was called the Third Branch Corps. The remaining townships also had corps and branch corps. Then, in terms of a team, some had more and some had less. The most had more than 300 members, and the least had as few as 20 or 30 members. What order should Nanshi be the first, and Beishi should be the second? What standard should a certain district be a corps and a certain district be a branch corps? What circumstances should there be such a big difference? To sum it up in one sentence, it is that each is self-governing and there is no organization. The Rectification Committee is responsible for the mission of rectification, so it naturally pays attention to the organization. Therefore, after the meeting, it sent members to investigate in various townships, consult with local people, exchange opinions, and deliberate on the situation, and set a standard table, which was reported to the Municipal Government. The Municipal Government then underwent a detailed review before approving and issuing it together with the funds for each district corps. Now it is stipulated that the quota for a team is 108 members. The Nanshi Defense Corps was reorganized from twelve teams to nine teams. As long as you count on your fingers, you will know that the Nanshi Corps has 972 members. By extension, if you know how many teams there are in Beishi and various townships, you will know how many members they have. This is the reason for the reorganization and inspection. Among you 972 people, no matter who you are, you are responsible for defending the local area. You must understand the meaning of the Defense Corps, implement the principles of the Defense Corps. When you become a member of the Defense Corps, you are serving the local area. In other words, the people of the local area rely on our Defense Corps to protect them. How great is our responsibility, how glorious is our reputation, how noble is our personality. Under the guidance of the Premier's Three Principles of the People and the legacy of mutual assistance, especially in Shanghai, where all kinds of people are mixed together, good and bad are not uniform, and all kinds of reactionary elements, what kind of communists, kidnappers, secret thieves, and robbers are everywhere. If you are not careful, you can disrupt the local tranquility. We must work hard to eradicate these human parasites. We must use all our strength to prevent the restlessness of these bad elements in the areas we protect, so that the people in our protected areas can enjoy peace, not suffer losses, and not be panic-stricken. Then the three words "Defense Corps" will be resounding, and you will not be a member of the Defense Corps in vain. To put it another way, Shanghai has always been mentioned in the same breath as the military, police, and corps. The army is for foreign enemies, the police maintain public order, and only our Defense Corps, although its task is to assist the military and police, its nature is no different from that of a business corps. It is entirely for the protection of itself. The government should also send personnel and allocate funds to manage and rectify us. Then our corps members should fulfill some obligations, and what they eat is nothing. Therefore, as a corps member, one, you must absolutely obey orders, two, you must effectively defend the local area, three, you must abide by discipline, four, you must recognize your responsibilities, and five, you must intensify training. If you have not done the above five points, you must hurry to go in this direction. If you have already done it, you must continue to work hard and never give up. What I have taught today is here, and what I hope is also here. That's all.</p>
<h3 id="e127">County Public Safety Bureau Requests Advance Payment of Back Wages <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Totaling Approximately 20,000 Yuan for Five Months</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Public Safety Bureau, citing the non-payment of wages for nearly five months, which has severely impacted the ability of police officers to sustain themselves, yesterday formally requested the county government to temporarily advance funds to alleviate their financial hardship. The submitted document is as follows:</p>
<p>"Subject: Urgent Request for Allocation of Long-Overdue Wages to Alleviate the Financial Distress of Police Officers.</p>
<p>It has come to our attention that the salaries of the police officers under the jurisdiction of this bureau have been in arrears for four and a half months, starting from the latter half of January of this year, with only one month's worth of wages being paid by the former County Magistrate during his tenure. Subsequently, only a small amount of food allowance was disbursed. Most of these police officers come from impoverished families and rely entirely on these salaries to sustain their livelihoods. Since the onset of wage arrears, they have exhausted all means of pawnage and borrowing, enduring hardships that are difficult to describe. Their forbearance and dedication to service are due not only to the repeated encouragement from the County Magistrate but also to the hope that the arrears will be cleared in due course, thereby providing relief. However, as the delay has persisted for an extended period, this matter of wage arrears remains unresolved, causing them to feel anxious and restless day and night. Should this situation continue indefinitely, it will become a lingering issue, jeopardizing the officers' livelihoods and making it difficult to remain silent. The bureau chief is constantly questioned by his subordinates, and he is at a loss for an answer. Previously, this bureau received a clear directive from your esteemed office, which was forwarded from the provincial government, to dispatch personnel to jointly request the government to settle the outstanding debts. The original intention was to clear the wage arrears. Now, several months have passed, and this bureau has repeatedly petitioned for an advance payment, pending the resolution of disputes between the province and the city, before reimbursement. To date, no resolution has been reached, and the subordinates are in dire straits. This document is hereby submitted to your esteemed office for review, humbly requesting that you forward it to the relevant authorities for approval, so that it can be disseminated for compliance."</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government has received an order from the provincial government to raise 60,000 yuan in customs treasury bonds, which has subsequently been reduced to 40,000 yuan. The order mandates that the county government make every effort to raise the funds, and if the full amount cannot be raised, it is permitted to temporarily borrow funds from the approved two-yuan surcharge on tribute rice for settlement, to be repaid upon the collection of winter tribute rice. Upon receiving the order, County Magistrate Yan immediately began actively raising funds. Given the urgent need for customs treasury bonds for military expenditure, it was agreed with Director Wang of the Finance Bureau that, in addition to the 1,500 yuan already remitted, an additional 3,500 yuan would be raised and remitted, for a total of 5,000 yuan. It is also reported that the raising of cigarette treasury bonds has been temporarily suspended by order.</p>

<h3 id="e133">Addition of Textile Testing <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Industrial Products Testing Laboratory in Shanghai (address: 4 Hehe Lane, Xiafei Road; telephone: 37263), which has been in operation for the past two years since its establishment, has handled a total of two hundred and several tens of cases involving testing and research commissioned by various manufacturers in the city, earning widespread trust and a high reputation in the community. This year, it has added textile testing facilities, ordered equipment from abroad, and dispatched personnel to various factories to collect products. Those that have been successively sent to the laboratory include: velvet from Tongcheng Textile Company; cotton and silk stockings from Shanghai Textile Factory and Tongji Hosiery Factory; silk fabrics from Jinyun, Meiya, Wuhua, and other silk factories; fabrics of various colors from Dafeng, Lixin, Hongxin, Sanxin, and other dyeing and weaving factories; coarse cloth from Yong'an, Hengfeng, Housheng, Zhentai, and other textile companies; cotton fabrics of various colors from Samsung Cotton Iron Company; various undershirts, health shirts, and trouser materials from Wuhe Textile Factory; canvas from Huacheng Canvas Factory; Beichou silk from Kenhuang Huachou Silk Factory; and woolen fabrics from Zhanghua Dahua Woolen Factory, totaling over three hundred pieces. Others are currently being collected by the Machine-Made National Products Factories United Association, the Silk Fabric Trade Association, the Knitting Industry Trade Association, and others. The ordered machinery has gradually arrived and been installed. Testing is expected to begin soon. At the same time, it is planned to collect products from various foreign countries for similar testing to identify their strengths and serve as a model for improving national products. Any weaving factory in the city wishing to determine the quality, strength, or color fastness of its products (cloth, silk, wool, velvet, gabardine, stockings, undershirts, health shirts, etc.), or to compare the quality with similar imported products, may commission the laboratory to conduct testing and issue certificates in accordance with the laboratory's regulations. Furthermore, any government agency, school, or individual purchasing clothing materials, woolen fabrics, blankets, etc., wishing to determine their quality or to verify whether delivered goods conform to samples, may also engage the laboratory for testing at a very low cost.</p>

<p>Requesting the New Acting General Manager to Take Office. Cai Ziping, the acting General Manager of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sent a telegram to Li Zhonggong, the newly appointed General Manager, who has already arrived in Beijing, requesting instructions from Minister Wang regarding the reorganization of the company. Cai reported that during his tenure as acting General Manager, the case involving the San De Tang was handled to the point of discussing the purchase of the warehouse property and the renewal of the wharf lease, thus avoiding the enforcement of the French court's judgment. Arrears in salary for all employees have also been paid for one month. All procedures have been handled clearly, and he is awaiting Li's arrival in Shanghai to prepare for the handover. As he is eager to hand over the responsibilities, he telegraphed Beijing, urging General Manager Li to take office as soon as possible. It is reported that Li is discussing with Minister Wang and others in Beijing issues such as financial measures and the nationalization of the company's operations. He will come to Shanghai after the discussion.</p>
<p>Construction Temporarily Suspended. The construction of Jinliyuan Warehouse No. 15, which began during Zhao Tieqiao's tenure, involved demolishing the old warehouse and building a new-style warehouse to develop transportation. The company's land in the Nanshi area was also to be redeveloped into new-style commercial buildings. Recently, as the commencement of construction of these two projects was approaching, General Manager Cai issued an order to temporarily suspend the construction work on both sites, pending the arrival of the new General Manager to the company before construction can proceed.</p>
<p>Current Operating Vessels. The company's upper Yangtze River steamer Emei, due to damage requiring repair, will arrive in Shanghai today. The ocean-going fleet has a large number of vessels in Hankou and Haizhou. Therefore, only five vessels are currently in operation.</p>
<p>Competition Plans. Shen Zhongyi and Li Yunliang, the chief and deputy of the Business Department, have a fundamental plan to reorganize and expand competition in the Yangtze River shipping industry to reclaim shipping rights lost to foreign companies. However, the Zhao case and the inability to maintain scheduled voyages have prevented its implementation. Recently, Shen and Li, given the lifting of the ban on rice transport on the Yangtze River, are taking advantage of this suspension of voyages to plan the implementation of expanded competition in upstream and downstream Yangtze River shipping. They are currently consulting with branch offices in various ports via telegram and letter, and are very busy.</p>

<h3 id="e135">Order to Investigate Electric Light Plants Established in Cities and Towns <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an instruction from the Jiangsu Construction Department, stating: "Regarding the Electric Power Business plan submitted by the Construction Committee, the General Assembly resolved to expedite the establishment of electric light plants within cities. As the electric power business is of great importance, European and American countries have been developing it for fifty years and continue to invest their efforts without reservation. Our country is still in its infancy in this regard. Unless we make a concerted effort to catch up, we will not be able to meet the needs of the current century or achieve the goal of universal electrification. In addition to distributing the order, the original plan is hereby copied and sent to your department, instructing you to diligently follow the three steps of investigation, planning, and implementation, and to report the progress regularly for verification." This order is hereby forwarded, along with the original plan. Although the electric power business in our province has taken shape, there are still many counties, townships, and towns without electric light plants. It is imperative to actively promote and plan to achieve universal electrification. The method of implementation should begin with investigation. All county-level urban areas, cities, and towns suitable for establishing electric light plants should be thoroughly investigated as a basis for planning and implementation. In accordance with this order, the County Magistrate Yan, in addition to distributing the order, is hereby forwarding two copies of the investigation form, instructing the county's Construction Bureau to work with the heads of various districts to conduct investigations and report in accordance with the items listed in the form for verification. County Magistrate Yan has instructed the Construction Bureau to forward the documents to the district chiefs for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Trade Associations Must Be Formed If There Are More Than Seven Businesses in the Same Industry <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Cannot Join the Chamber of Commerce as Individual Shops</p>
<p>Previously, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce was instructed by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that shop members of the Chamber of Commerce must be members of a trade association if there are fewer than seven companies in the same industry within the same region. Otherwise, a trade association must first be organized, and representatives then sent to the Chamber of Commerce by the trade association. This regulation differs from the principle of the Chamber of Commerce Law decided by the Central Political Conference, which stipulates that even if businesses in the same industry meet the conditions for organizing a trade association, they are not required to do so. As there are conflicting opinions, a special request was submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for verification and instruction. The Chamber has now received a response from the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Upon review, Article 2 of the Amended Implementing Regulations of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations Law stipulates that (when there are seven or more companies or firms in the same industry in the same region, they must organize a trade association in accordance with this law), etc. This order has been promulgated by the Ministry and must be followed accordingly, without the need for further inquiries. Please be informed of this ruling."</p>

<p>Employees in various departments under the jurisdiction of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations receive a salary increase once every year in January or July. The salary increase period for July of this year has arrived. Department heads have submitted lists to the Administration Division, requesting salary increases at different levels according to the established precedent. Director Liu has submitted the request to the Ministry, and the announcement is expected to be made soon. The salary increase issue for the police departments of the two railways has already been announced, instructing the police departments of various sections to comply. Section chiefs will receive an increase ranging from ten to seven yuan, depending on their rank. Those who have worked for less than one year will not receive an increase. Patrol officers will receive five yuan, patrol leaders two yuan, and patrolmen one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Freight Rates Remain at 6% <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations previously received the sixth edition of the new regulations for passenger and freight transport promulgated by the Ministry of Railways, scheduled to take effect on September 1st. The Traffic Department immediately instructed station staff to comply with the new regulations. It has now been learned that the new regulations for passenger and freight transport on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line have already been implemented. However, the original freight rate for passenger baggage was 6% per kilogram per fifty kilometers. The newly issued sixth edition increases this rate by 1% to 7%. Now, with the approval of the Ministry, the freight rate for passenger baggage will remain at the old rate of 6%. The Traffic Department has telegraphed all relevant station staff to take note of this.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Citizens Association Urges British Firm to Compensate Insurance Premiums <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Citizens United Association sent a letter to the British firm Jardine Matheson, urging them to compensate the insurance premiums for the Hanlun Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou, stating: "Regarding the matter of notice, this association has received a telegram dated the 30th from the Zhejiang General Chamber of Commerce, stating that member Cao Shengming established the Hanlun Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou and insured it with the Shanghai British firm Jardine Matheson for 10,000 taels of silver. He holds two insurance policies: (1) 22 wooden jacquard looms, insured for 6,000 taels of silver, and other goods insured for 2,000 taels of silver; (2) business assets insured for 1,000 taels of silver and clothing insured for 1,000 taels of silver, totaling 10,000 taels. Unfortunately, on March 20th of this year, due to the negligence of a neighbor, a fire spread to the factory, completely destroying it and causing losses of over 27,000 yuan. Subsequently, Jardine Matheson entrusted the Louis Moore firm to conduct an on-site inspection in Hangzhou. Initially, they made excuses about unclear accounts, then insisted on copying the police station's fire investigation report for further discussion. Finally, they falsely claimed that the factory did not have 22 looms, even asserting that the factory had not been operating in recent years. Cao Shengming urgently sought the insurer to fulfill its responsibility and, in response to the accusations, provided evidence to refute each point. However, he was unable to gain the insurer's understanding. Eventually, Louis Moore, representing Jardine Matheson, declared that Jardine Matheson would not be responsible for the Hanlun insurance claim. Several months of negotiations yielded no results. It has been determined that the fire that destroyed the Hanlun Silk Weaving Factory was caused by others, and the factory was not intentionally or negligently at fault, as evidenced by the testimony of fireman Feng Zhao at the police station. Whether the factory was operating and how many looms it had can be easily verified and cannot be concealed by empty words. Jardine Matheson deliberately made unfounded accusations without providing any counter-evidence and delayed payment for several months, which is a breach of contract and good faith, tantamount to fraud, and undermines their insurance qualifications. We request your association to assist us in this matter." After discussion by the Specialized Committee of our association, it was generally agreed that the British firm Jardine Matheson should fulfill its obligation to pay the insurance claim for the Hanlun Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou and cannot make baseless accusations or shirk their credibility and responsibility. It was resolved to send a special letter of warning, requiring them to raise the full amount of 10,000 taels of silver within three days of receipt of the letter and compensate Cao Shengming of the Hanlun Silk Weaving Factory in Hangzhou for the overdue interest. Otherwise, the facts will be published in the newspaper, warning the Chinese public not to take out insurance with Jardine Matheson in the future. Those who have already taken out insurance and have not yet expired should cancel their policies as a penalty for Jardine Matheson's abandonment of credit and dereliction of responsibility. Accordingly, we hereby notify you and request that you investigate and respond within three days of receipt of this letter. Please do not neglect this important matter. To the British firm Jardine Matheson, from the Citizens United Association of the Shanghai Special District.</p>

<p>Silk Filature Industry: In response to the truth about the import of Japanese cocoons and to alleviate this year's cocoon shortage, the Silk Filature Industry Trade Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: "The Jiang, Zhe, and Wan provinces produced only a very meager spring and summer cocoon crop this year. Based on investigations, the total output is only a little over 200,000 piculs, which is nearly 45% less than in a bumper year. Most silk filatures, which rely on this raw material, are located in Shanghai. It is estimated that the supply of cocoons will be exhausted before the end of the year. As the silk market is depressed, silk filatures cannot make a profit. Once the raw material runs out and the factories are forced to shut down, over 100,000 workers will lose their jobs, and the families who rely on them for a living will also be in dire straits. If each family is estimated to have an average of three or four people, then 300,000 to 400,000 people will be plunged into poverty at the same time. After repeated consideration, the members of the silk filature industry want to uphold the principle of people's livelihood and show love and compassion. The only option is to adapt to the circumstances and seek a temporary relief measure. How can we idly talk about patriotism and watch these hundreds of thousands of people lose their livelihoods? As Japan has a bumper cocoon crop and is exporting them, it may be possible to set strict limits and purchase some dried cocoons to alleviate the temporary cocoon shortage. International trade is not prohibited by the government, and the import tariff rate for cocoons is set at 12.5% ad valorem. Moreover, in the past, when there was a surplus of Chinese cocoons, they were exported to Japan. Now that there is a shortage of Chinese cocoons, it is reasonable to purchase Japanese cocoons to provide relief. Cocoons are a raw material for silk production and are similar in nature to agricultural products such as rice, wheat, and cotton. Therefore, we request the Chairman of the Silk Cocoon General Association, Huang , to make preparations for the future, request instructions from the government, and ask for a one-year tax exemption to maintain the raw material costs in this declining silk market for necessary use in the future. It is reported that after the Customs Administration received instructions from the Ministry, it ordered the Silk Cocoon General Association to reduce the import tax on Japanese cocoons by 25% from October of this year to May of next year, with a limit of 60,000 piculs. This is to purchase Japanese cocoons to supplement the raw materials for silk reeling, thereby preventing the interruption of silk export trade and avoiding the loss of livelihoods for tens of thousands of workers. This is the course of events. Initially, when the Japanese sent cocoon samples, three or four silk filatures each purchased 10 to 20 catties of sample cocoons, some as many as 30 to 40 catties. After testing, the quality of the cocoons was found to be very good. Based on the reeling calculation, one picul of cocoons could produce one load of silk if 300 to 350 catties of cocoons were reeled. Thus, the load quota was set and a date was set for shipping to China. However, the Japanese silk manufacturers, out of jealousy, colluded with the cocoon merchants and forbade them from selling cocoons to Chinese merchants. Then, under the pretext of miscalculating the price, they suspended the shipment to China. This is also the truth about the widely circulated news that Japanese cocoons were shipped but not actually imported. We hereby report the facts truthfully."</p>

<p>Meeting Place Arranged at the Unified Hotel</p>
<p>Secret Plan: Detectives Posed as the Victim</p>
<p>Zhang Caigen and Two Others Arrested for Attempting to Get Rich</p>
<p>Banditry is rampant in Shanghai, and despite the rigorous investigations by the concession police authorities, they have not been able to curb the wave of crime. Yu Mingrui, a resident of the French Concession who deals in cotton yarn and has a modest but comfortable life, with lavish spending habits, attracted the attention of bandits. He recently received an extortion letter with very forceful language, stating that they needed military funds and demanding 10,000 yuan in cash, or else they would resort to illegal means. The letter also arranged a meeting at the Unified Hotel at 164 Edward Road, near Six Road, the night before last, with the letter serving as proof of identity. After receiving the letter, Yu Mingrui carefully examined the tone of the letter, deemed it rather dangerous, and immediately reported it to the French police for investigation. As the bandits' meeting place was in the Public Concession, the French police chief immediately reported it to Inspector Liu Shaokui of the General Police Station. Upon hearing this news, Liu, viewing it as a case of extortion against law-abiding citizens, and to eliminate bandits, immediately disguised himself and Chinese and foreign detectives and went to the Unified Hotel without making a sound. They pretended to be there to negotiate. As expected, someone came to talk to them, and they were arrested. As a result, three men, including Zhang Caigen from Tianjin, were arrested and taken back to the police station. It is reported that they will be transferred to the court for trial today.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Joint Suppression of Pirates in Da'an Port <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Provincial Government Sends Junhe and Boxian Warships</p>
<p>Naval Department Sends Jingxing and Hu'e Warships</p>
<p>Da'an Port waters outside Wusong, where the sea meets land, is occupied by a large group of pirates who are creating a great disturbance, the details of which have been reported in this newspaper. Later, it was reported that the pirates there had been severely suppressed by the water and land police forces and had fled to the open sea. It is now known that the above news is not accurate. The pirates are now even more rampant than before, and the water and land police forces, due to their limited strength, have not yet found a way to suppress them. Zhang Han, the District Chief of the Fourth Water Police District of Wusong, fearing the potential for future trouble, went to the province a few days ago to meet with Provincial Governor Ye and Civil Affairs Director Hu to personally report on the rampant pirate situation and request instructions on suppression measures. The provincial government has now ordered Chapter Fengyi, captain of the Junhe warship stationed in the waters of Hupu and Baigang, and Wang Zijun, captain of the Boxian warship, to set off fully equipped with weapons, ammunition, and coal yesterday to Da'an Port waters. They will join forces with the patrol boats of the 17th and 18th teams of the Fourth Water Police District, as well as the Pingyang and Zhenhai gunboats under their command, to encircle and severely suppress the pirates. Meanwhile, the provincial government has sent a telegram to the Naval Department requesting it to send warships to assist in the suppression. According to information from the National Coastal Defense Command in Wusong, Wu Zhennan, the commander of the command, has received a telegram order from Chen Shaokuan, acting Minister of the Navy, to send the Jingxing gunboat and the Hu'e torpedo boat under his command to assist in the joint suppression.</p>

<p>Who was this person?</p>
<p>What illness was it?</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, a man, appearing to be a coolie, approximately thirty years old, naked from the waist up, wearing only blue cloth trousers, barefoot and wearing straw sandals, was walking empty-handed along the section of Min Guo Road, east of Xin Qiao Street in the French Concession, in front of the entrance to Min Guo Li, when he suddenly collapsed. Fresh blood gushed from his mouth, and he died instantly. A patrolman discovered the scene and reported it to the Grand Clock Tower Police Station, who dispatched an investigator. They confirmed that the death was due to spitting blood caused by illness. Unable to find any family, the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall autopsy room. After the investigator reported back to the police chief, they were instructed to photograph the body, and the hall was instructed to provide a coffin for burial, awaiting family identification at the tomb.</p>
<h3 id="e146">A Disastrous Marriage of the Qin and Xu Families <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Love began, divorce ended</p>
<p>The sin of a deceitful matchmaker</p>
<p>Xu Hengtai, a stonemason living outside the Small South Gate on Sang Yuan Street, had only one daughter, nicknamed A'Nan, who was not particularly attractive. She was nineteen this year. Because she was an only child, her parents doted on her. Two years ago, Qin Yu Tai, a young master stonemason from the Lu Jia Bang Road bridge, Qin Genfu, who was twenty years old and unmarried, whose father had passed away, was introduced to her by his friend Wang Chunlin. Genfu and A'Nan fell in love. Wang told Qin that the Xu family was wealthy and she was an only child. He told A'Nan that the Qin family was rich and he was the only son. However, the opposite turned out to be true. But Qin and Xu had been in love for a long time, and last September, her belly grew large and could not be hidden. She was pregnant. Qin then demanded to marry her, but Xu Hengtai strongly opposed the illicit behavior. However, his wife, Xu Xu Shi, doted on her daughter and, because Qin and A'Nan had spoken of dying for love, they had no choice but to allow the marriage in November. However, two months after the marriage, she gave birth to a son. Unexpectedly, the love faded, and eventually they broke up. Recently, Xu A'Nan filed a lawsuit in the local court against Genfu, accusing him of seduction and abduction with the sole purpose of seizing her mother's family's property. Later, because she had borrowed money several times and her mother's family could no longer provide constant assistance, he realized they were not wealthy, and his attitude changed drastically, and he became abusive. On the sixteenth of last month, because of a private matter involving her mother-in-law, he became angry with her and forced her to drink medicine, causing her to fall into a coma. Later, neighbors sent her to Ye Lu Hospital for an injection and treatment, and she regained consciousness, discovering it was tranquilizer medicine, indicating he had intended to harm her. Furthermore, at the beginning of this month, she was beaten with a tree branch, leaving her covered in injuries. He then presented her with a rope and a knife, forcing her to choose one for suicide, leaving her with no way out, and she requested help. After the court confirmed that Xu A'Nan had indeed been injured, Qin Genfu was summoned yesterday. According to Qin, he did not beat her. He said that because she was often not at home, they did have arguments. As for the tranquilizer medicine, he was unaware of it and claimed she took it at her mother's house to harm him. After Prosecutor Wu verified the statements, he ordered Genfu to be detained pending investigation.</p>

<p>Wang Dehong Sues for His Daughter's Seduction</p>
<p>Wang Aidi Insists on Marrying Zhuang</p>
<p>Is she seventeen or twenty years old?</p>
<p>Wang Dehong, a Chinese constable No. 249 from the Harbin Police Station's San Dao Tou, accused Zhuang Ruinian, from Anhui, of seducing his daughter, Aidi. The case was heard in the Special District Local Court by Judge Cheng the day before yesterday afternoon. According to the plaintiff, his daughter, Aidi, is seventeen years old. Last year, when Zhuang was a patrolman at the Harbin Police Station, he lived in the same house with them. Seeing that his daughter had some looks, he seduced her and committed adultery, and then abducted her. He requested severe punishment. The defendant stated that he and the plaintiff had a good relationship because they worked in the same place, and that his daughter, Aidi, was also very close to him. On the tenth of last month, he was admitted to the hospital due to illness, and Aidi came to visit him from time to time. After he recovered, he was very grateful. One day, he went to the plaintiff's house and saw Aidi was going to a relative's house to celebrate, so the plaintiff asked him to accompany her. The rest of his statement mainly described his love affair with Aidi. Subsequently, Wang Aidi stated that she is twenty years old. The court noted that her reported age did not match her father's, so they asked her exactly how old she was. Aidi still claimed she was actually twenty years old. Her father said she was seventeen because she had previously accused someone of raping her. At that time, her father ordered her to say she was only seventeen years old when she appeared in court. If she said she was twenty years old, the judge would not prosecute the rape charge against person A. She obeyed her father's order. This case is different from the previous one, so she should tell the truth. However, the plaintiff insisted that his daughter was only seventeen years old, and there was a witness. Subsequently, a nearly fifty-year-old woman from Yancheng, Chu Jiangshi, was brought to court. She testified that she used to live in the same house with the plaintiff in Yu Deli in the French Concession. Aidi was born there. When she delivered the baby, it was in 1914, so she is really only seventeen years old. Her husband is currently Constable No. 1343. Judge Cheng further questioned Aidi, who insisted on her previous statement, saying that her father initially wanted to marry her to the defendant, but when he lost his job, he gave him the cold shoulder. Now, he wants her to remarry a Chinese constable No. 1039. Although she has not been to school, she knows the meaning of staying with one person until the end. Judge Cheng advised her not to be stubborn and to obey her father's orders. The girl said that since she had followed the defendant, she vowed not to change her mind, and especially did not want to go home with her father, as she would inevitably be abused. The court ordered the defendant and Aidi to be detained separately pending a further hearing.</p>

<p>The good news of Wu Jiusheng and Huang Xiaoya</p>
<p>Wu Mingkun, a resident of No. 6 Hefeng Road, Wusong, has a son named Jusheng, who is fifteen years old. The Huang family, who lives next door at No. 4, has a daughter named Xiaoya, who is the same age as Jusheng. Because of their close proximity, they often visited each other, were childhood sweethearts, and were very close. They often lingered in Xiaoya's room to play. The parents did not suspect anything because they were both minors. Little did they know that Jusheng already understood matters of the heart, and Xiaoya's love blossomed early. They had been secretly engaging in illicit affairs for some time, and Xiaoya was pregnant. The parents were completely unaware and in the dark. Recently, Mingkun recommended Jusheng to learn a trade in Shanghai, so he separated from Xiaoya. Although he was reluctant to leave, he dared not disobey his father's orders. The other day, the postman delivered a letter that was opened by Xiaoya's brother. It was sent by Jusheng to Xiaoya and mentioned their secret affair, saying she was more than two months pregnant, and asking what to do in the future. After Xiaoya's brother read it, he finally understood what was happening and told his father, scolding Xiaoya for being shameless. After being reprimanded, Xiaoya was filled with shame and anger and tried to hang herself, but fortunately, she was discovered before anything happened. It is now understood that both sets of parents feel that the matter has already reached this point, so there is no need to create further complications. They agreed to discuss marriage, so that the childhood sweethearts can finally become a family.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Continued Hearing of the Impersonating Lawyer Case <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The one impersonating Zhang Guisan could not invite the real Zhang Guisan</p>
<p>Qi Tongsheng and others were ordered to pay 500 yuan bail</p>
<p>Zhang Zuotang, a native of Ningbo, claimed to be lawyer Zhang Guisan, soliciting lawsuits and defrauding people of money. The Shanghai Bar Association discovered this and sent a letter to the Special District Local Court Prosecutor's Office, reporting him for legal action. Chief Prosecutor Zhou had the case handed over to the police station for investigation by lawyer Ru Baoyi. The investigation concluded there was suspicion of fraud and extortion, and a public prosecution was initiated. After Judge Zhou Taliang opened the trial, the defendant was ordered to be detained pending further hearing, as reported in this newspaper. The continued hearing took place the day before yesterday afternoon. According to the defendant, Zhang Guisan is indeed another person and not an alias he used. He is currently a lawyer in Hangzhou. The court asked if he could invite Zhang Guisan to testify, but the defendant said he could not invite Zhang Guisan himself, but he could provide evidence to prove it. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that according to the investigation, the so-called Zhang Guisan is actually the defendant's alias, "Zuotang Guisan, indeed are two and one, and two also." Subsequently, Judge Zhou noted that Qi Tongsheng and others had not been summoned as key witnesses in a case where the defendant, representing Yuan Shun Haiweihao, had sought a check from Gongchang Embroidery Shop on Beijing Road, and further investigation was needed. He ordered the defendant to pay 500 yuan bail and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>

<p>Lawyer's Fees Become an Issue</p>
<p>The case of Zhao Xiuzhen, a dancer at the Da Dong Ballroom, suing Zhu Mintang for seduction and pregnancy, was approved by the Special District Court for summons and hearing. At the initial hearing, because the defendant did not appear, Judge Ge Zhitan adjourned the hearing to the sixth of this month for a further summons. However, a few days before the adjourned hearing, Zhu Mintang repeatedly went to Zhao's residence at No. 37 Fanshi Li on Murming Road to discuss settlement terms. A settlement was finally reached on the evening of the fifth. Zhu brought a letter withdrawing the private prosecution, which Zhao and her mother signed. Zhu then submitted the request for withdrawal. Therefore, outsiders only knew that the matter was settled, but the settlement terms were not announced. Although the case was withdrawn, another issue arose. When the case was settled, the lawyers for both parties were not consulted in advance. At the time, Zhao had hired lawyer Zhang Chongding, introduced by a Mr. Gu, and signed a retainer agreement, stating that the fees would be based on the highest amount stipulated in the Shanghai Bar Association's regulations, divided into civil and criminal parts. According to these regulations, the fees would be 1,500 yuan, payable upon completion of the case. Now that the case has been settled, Zhao believes that the lawyer's fees should be borne by the Zhu family. Negotiations have been ongoing through the original introducer for several days, and a resolution is expected on Sunday.</p>

Therefore, yesterday they separately announced a strict ban, and ordered each pig farm, trade on the national calendar's three, six, nine days, to honor the calendar law. Furthermore, given that there are many latrines in the town, which not only harms hygiene, but also hinders the view, another announcement was issued banning them.

(2) The decision to rebuild or demolish will be made jointly by this office and this bureau. (3) After a decision is made, it will be posted on the latrine and notified to the business owners. (4) Those who fail to comply within the time limit will be handled by the office and bureau, and all expenses will be borne by the craftsmen. For those that are demolished, the materials will be confiscated to offset the costs, and for those that are rebuilt, the business owners will pay the costs, otherwise they will be used as public latrines. (5) Those who are unwilling to rebuild but are willing to demolish will be allowed to do so, but must also complete the demolition within the time limit. (6) This is a local public welfare matter, and absolutely no pleading or delay will be tolerated.</p>

<p>There was an old Yang Wang Temple inside the East Gate of Baoshan. Recently, it was intended to be converted into a fire station, a national arts research hall, and a primary school site. Therefore, many carpenters and artisans were hired to repair the temple buildings and completely renovate them, spending more than a thousand yuan in repairs. The project was about to be completed when, on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 6th) at about 9 o'clock, the sky suddenly became overcast, with lightning and thunder, followed by torrential rain. Suddenly, there was a loud crash, and the western half of the temple building immediately collapsed, with many tables, benches, and other items inside damaged. Fortunately, no one was inside at the time, so no accidents occurred. However, according to nearby residents, when the lightning struck, the sound was so loud that it was several times louder than the firing of a cannon, causing those who heard it to be frightened. They only saw golden serpents dancing in the air, and the smell of sulfur and smoke filled their noses. After the rain, they learned that the Yang Wang Temple had been struck by lightning. However, an inspection of the collapsed area revealed no special phenomena. Only a huge courtyard pillar inside the building was struck in half by the lightning.</p>

<p>Hua Cheng Factory Takes Back First</p>
<p>Wang Zhizhuang Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fine</p>
<p>The Hua Cheng Wood Thread Ball Factory on Kaifeng Road had previously been defrauded of 360 dozen thread balls. Subsequently, Xu A'mei, a woman from Wusong, was arrested for selling the stolen goods on behalf of the factory. Then, the swindler Wang Zhizhuang was arrested on Avenue Edward VII. Both were sent to the Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention, as detailed in previous reports. The stolen thread balls have now been recovered by the factory, led by a detective, from the Zhong Xing Clothing Store at No. 48 Hubei Road, the Cheng Chang Pawnshop at No. 54 Avenue Dubail, the Hong Chang Pawnshop at No. 44 Avenue Magill, No. 10 Avenue Kirock, and No. 24 Ximen Bizhou Road, totaling 72 dozen. In addition, some were also found, so only 40 dozen are missing. The court held another hearing the day before yesterday. Zhu Sifei, a lawyer representing the Hua Cheng Factory, appeared in court and stated that Wang Zhizhuang had used the alias Wang Daming when defrauding the factory. He requested punishment and filed a private prosecution to recover the value of the goods. Judge Xu verified the statements and immediately sentenced Wang Zhizhuang to three years in prison and a fine of 300 yuan. Xu A'mei was sentenced to six months in prison and a fine of 100 yuan. If the fine cannot be paid, it can be commuted to one day of imprisonment for every two yuan. The counterfeit stamps were confiscated. Wang Zhizhuang must also compensate the plaintiff for the goods worth 71 yuan, and the stolen goods were returned to the plaintiff.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Machine Purchase Scam Unsuccessful <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Fake Zhuang Tickets Did Not Match</p>
<p>The Nanfang Heji Machine Company, located at the northern end of Xiaoximen on Zhonghua Road in this city, has been open for more than ten years and is known for manufacturing sock machines. Recently, due to increased investment and expansion, it reopened the day before yesterday. Many people ordered machines at once. Just as they were busy receiving customers, a man dressed in Western clothes, wearing leather shoes and glasses, around thirty years old, claiming to be Jiang Hongxiang, a purchasing agent for the Jiangyin Chengxin Weaving Company,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>came to the company to order five sock machines, five machines for woolen shirts, scarves and gloves, and hardware parts, stating that he needed the goods immediately. The company's manager, Lu Jinfan, and assistant manager, Zhou Zhusheng, said that most of the sock machines had already been ordered by other factories. Because Jiang was eager to ship them to Jiangyin, they agreed to give Jiang's purchase priority, agreeing on a price of 867.5 taels of silver. They instructed Jiang to send the goods to No. 6 Xinjiangli, western section of Avenue Lafayette that day and pay cash. The company's manager immediately supervised the workers to pack the machines and send them to the address on a flatbed cart. Jiang took the goods and gave a fake Zhuang ticket from Yuanda near the ball field, worth 1,000 taels of silver, instructing the manager to return more than 130 taels of silver. Lu, fearing that the Zhuang ticket was not real, immediately took the ticket and went to check it out. However, he searched the vicinity of the ball field and found no Yuanda Bank. Jiang waited for him to check the ticket, then instructed the freight clerk to go back, but the freight clerk refused. Jiang, knowing that his plan would not work, immediately fled without a trace. When Lu found that the ticket was invalid and returned to the address, he searched for the swindler in vain. He inquired with the second landlord, an old woman surnamed Lu, who said that the swindler had come three days ago to rent the downstairs room, saying that he wanted to set up a wholesale store for woolen socks, etc., agreeing to a monthly rent of 18 yuan, with a writing desk and a tea table renting for 1.2 yuan per month, paying a deposit of 5 yuan and agreeing to move in the next day. The door had a sign that said "Jiangchengxin Weaving Company Shenzhuang." At this point, Manager Lu knew that he had encountered a scammer, and it was fortunate that the goods had not been swindled away. He ordered the staff to return the goods to the company and, fearing that other businesses would be victims of the same scam, he telephoned other businesses to warn them to be careful.</p>

<p>Wood and Coffins Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>The Sanshin Yarn Factory's lumber room at No. 87 Yangshupu Road suddenly caught fire at around 5:10 yesterday morning. Because the stored materials were mostly flammable wood, the fire quickly burned fiercely. The Yangshupu Fire Brigade, upon receiving the news, immediately drove to the scene to extinguish the fire, which was extinguished after about an hour and a half. The loss was about 2,000 yuan. It is said that the cause of the fire was that the gatekeeper was cooking snacks, and sparks flew into the wood shavings, causing them to burn. Most of the items made in the lumber room were coffins, which the factory used to give away as acts of charity.</p>

<p>Zhang Shijin Loses Both Wife and Money</p>
<p>Zhang Shijin, a 36-year-old from Gaoyou, lives at No. 575 Haichang Road, Zhabei. He works as a porter with a very small monthly income, so Zhang is nearly forty years old and still unmarried. A few days ago, a friend from Xinghua, Yu Hanqing, mentioned that Ren Younian's sister-in-law, Zhang Qiaozi, who is 25 years old, is quite beautiful. Because her family is poor, she is eager to find someone to marry and spend her life with. If interested, he can make an introduction at a small cost. Zhang was pleased to hear this and began negotiations. It was agreed that Zhang would give 25 yuan as a betrothal gift, and the wedding was held on the 23rd of last month. Although the relationship between the two was harmonious after Qiaozi entered the house, she suddenly changed her mind in less than half a month. On the 3rd of this month, she took advantage of Zhang's absence and fled. When Zhang noticed, he immediately asked people to search for her, but there was no news. Therefore, in a fit of anger, he came to the south and brought Yu Hanqing, along with Zhang Qiaozi's brother-in-law, Ren Younian, to the 25th sentry post of the police station, led by guard Sun Shaoqin. During the preliminary hearing by the station chief, Ren Younian stated that he was 30 years old, from Xinghua, and lived at No. 110 Youche Wharf. All of his sister-in-law, Zhang Qiaozi, had previously been married to a son of the Pan family in the countryside. However, because her husband's family was poor and unable to make a living, she had to escape and stay at his house. But he made a living pulling rickshaws and could not provide for her, so last month, his friend Yu Hanqing introduced her to Zhang Shijin. This time, she suddenly escaped again, which he knew nothing about. The station chief, seeing that the case was inconsistent and might involve collusion, ordered him to prepare a document and transfer it to the Shanghai Local Court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Chen Siyi, the temple caretaker of the Longwang Temple in Pudong, has a younger sister named Xiuwen, 25 years old, who lives with her brother. She and Lu Huanlin's wife, who lives nearby, are close friends and get along well. On July 16, Xiuwen suddenly disappeared. At the same time, Lu and his wife also left Pudong for Shanghai. Chen suspected that she had been taken away by the Lu couple, but there was nowhere to look for her. He was still hoping to find her when only Lu and his wife returned home yesterday. Chen then knew she had been sold, so he went to question them, but they denied it. Chen was extremely anxious and filed a complaint with the Third District Fourth Branch, who transferred it to the local court for handling.</p>

<p>Two Children Returned to Plaintiff</p>
<p>The cigarette and paper shop opened by Chen Zhiqian in Xujiahui Town was robbed of 320 yuan in cash by Zhong Guanbao, a 14-year-old apprentice, who fled and hid in a certain inn. However, Zhou Boyong, a tea server, was tempted by the money and, taking advantage of Zhong's sleep, sneaked into the room and stole 280 yuan in cash. When Zhong got up the next morning and checked the cash, it was missing, leaving very little. He realized that the money had also been stolen, so he dared not speak up. He paid the room fee, left the inn, and was seen by his family in the French Concession. They immediately took him to the police station. Zhong confessed the whole story, saying that he had been instigated by another apprentice, Su Yongsheng, and had given Su 20 yuan. The police chief, upon hearing the confession, ordered the detectives to arrest the inn's tea server, Zhou Boyong, and Su Yongzheng. However, the stolen money could not be recovered. They were sent to the Public Concession Court yesterday for investigation. First, shop owner Chen Zhiqian complained about the theft. Zhong Guanbao admitted to the theft, and his confession was similar to what he had said at the police station. Zhou Boyong admitted that he was tempted by the money and secretly stole it. He said that he had lost it all and could not return it, asking for leniency. Judge Zhu sentenced Zhou Boyong to one year in the Western Prison as a warning. The two children were returned to the plaintiff to be handed over to their families for supervision.</p>

Now, the meeting has decided that it is of utmost importance to protect the lives of Chinese people from such sacrifice, and to uphold the dignity and honor of the nation. In addition to submitting a request to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Shanghai Municipal Government to raise serious concerns, and sending letters to various institutions and groups for unanimous support, it has also publicly appointed representatives such as Tuixiang to go to the city chamber of commerce to inquire about the situation and actively proceed.

<h3 id="e173">Declaration of the Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi Anti-Communist and People's Salvation Association <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The crimes of the Communists were exposed during the Wuhan government era. Although the Kuomintang's anti-communism led to some restraint, the seeds of disaster spread throughout the country. Zhu and Mao led armed Red Armies that roamed the provinces of Jiangxi, Fujian, and Guangdong for three years without being wiped out. Knowledgeable people knew early on that this spark would be enough to set the plains ablaze. In the past year, the disaster caused by the Communists has intensified, causing countless people across the country to lose their homes and lives, especially the people of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. In Jiangxi province, over three-quarters of the province's eighty-odd counties have been ravaged by the Communists. Those who survive and live in terror are only along the Nanchang to Jiujiang line. In Hubei province, over two-thirds of the province's sixty-odd counties have been ravaged by the Communists, forming a major encirclement of the three towns of Wuhan. People who previously considered Wuhan a refuge are now in a state of panic, not knowing when their lives will end. In Hunan province, western Hunan has long become a Communist stronghold, and eastern Hunan has been repeatedly massacred by the Communists. Changsha, a major city in the province, has recently been reported to have fallen. Schools were destroyed, consulates were destroyed, shops were destroyed, residences were destroyed, and government offices were destroyed. In a matter of days, the entire city was almost reduced to a wasteland. Famous teachers and respected scholars were all killed as being senile and ignorant. Well-to-do families were all killed as being landlords and local bullies. Clerks were all killed as being corrupt officials. Scholars were all killed as being intellectuals. Those who were lucky enough to escape were in imminent danger, unable to support themselves. This is a tragic event unprecedented in history, and all patriots and people of goodwill who hear of it cannot help but feel heartbroken. Moreover, the disaster caused by the Communists is not limited to Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. In Guangdong, southern Fujian, northern Jiangsu, eastern Sichuan, and northern Anhui, the disaster is not as severe as in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, but it has been brewing for a long time, and the signs of disaster are already visible. If not addressed urgently, these areas may become the next Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. The reason why the Communists are rampant in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces is that they want to take advantage of the turmoil in the Central Plains, to connect the Communists of the three provinces to form a central force, and then to establish contact with the Communists of nearby provinces to communize the entire country and submit to Soviet Russia. Therefore, the safety of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces is not only related to the survival of the people of the three provinces, but can also predetermine the fate of the people of the entire country. The people of our three provinces must unite and thoroughly oppose communism to save themselves from the current crisis. The people of other provinces must not stand idly by and do nothing. If they think that the disaster has not yet reached them and remain indifferent, and then run away when the disaster strikes, China is so large that there may be nowhere to escape. If those with ambition can rise up righteously to save the people who are suffering from communism and take on the responsibility of eradicating the Communists, and if everyone can work together with one heart, we can certainly wipe out the Communists and reverse the catastrophe of the country. By saving others, we can also save ourselves. Is this not better than sitting and waiting for death? The members of this association, seeing this situation, have formed this association in the hope of encouraging each other. The aims we advocate are stated in the charter. We only know how to oppose communism and save the people, and we do not ask about anything else. Anyone who shares our sentiments is welcome to provide assistance.

<h3 id="e175">Oriental Daily's View of Sino-Foreign Trade <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>A National Harvest Means Fundamental Trade Conditions are in Place; Hope for an Early End to Internal Warfare to Promote Economic Activity</p>
<p>An Osaka Asahi Shimbun editorial states: China's foreign trade typically reaches its peak in the second half of the year. As China is an agricultural nation, its purchasing power depends on the abundance or scarcity of agricultural products. According to reports from Chinese sources, the planting this year has benefited from suitable weather throughout the country, with sunshine and rain in good balance, resulting in a rare harvest in recent years. In the three northeastern provinces, which are rich in agricultural products, the planting has been excellent, and security is assured, which is a great difference from last year when the Russian-Chinese conflict caused disturbances.</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to news from Shandong, the planting in the provinces of Shandong, Hebei, and Henan this year has been an unusually bountiful harvest. Sorghum, millet, peanuts, tobacco, and other crops are expected to increase in yield, some even doubling the normal yield. Wheat planting in the spring was also quite good. This shows that North China, which has been suffering from a major drought for the past two or three years, has gradually escaped its plight, and this is also evidence of the easing of the severe drought in Shaanxi and Gansu. This summer, Henan province has also experienced frequent rainfall, which has been absent for the past two or three years. Henan's harvest can also cultivate the purchasing power of farmers and stimulate foreign trade. This is not limited to Henan.</p>
<p>The provinces south of the Yangtze River are different from North China, often suffering from poor harvests due to excessive rainfall. This year, there have been no reports of areas suffering from floods. It is feared that this year's harvest will be a general harvest across the country, which has already laid the fundamental conditions for stimulating foreign trade to reach its peak in the second half of the year. However, in order to fully realize these conditions, there is a prerequisite that must be fulfilled. This is none other than the hope that the internal warfare that straddles the three provinces of Henan, Shandong, and Hebei will end quickly. If the war ends soon, agricultural products can be freely transported, and there is hope for peace in the future. Then, the economic activities that have been suppressed by war and famine will suddenly be promoted, and the trade in the second half of this year will see unexpected prosperity.</p>
<p>Looking at the trade situation in July of this year, it already shows vitality. Among them, the business situation in Guangdong is particularly prosperous, and it also stimulates the Shanghai market. This is because although Guangdong suffered from the challenge of the Gui faction in the first half of this year, with continuous warfare, and the Gui faction entered Hunan in May and June, the two Guang provinces have returned to stability. Once the continuous warfare ends, the economic world there will immediately be revived, as we have seen.</p>
<p>Therefore, the results of Sino-Foreign trade in the second half of this year depend on how quickly the war is quelled. Today, Shanghai's silver reserves are 220 million taels, which is a special reason for the sharp drop in silver prices. If, during this year's national bumper harvest, internal turmoil is quelled and temporary peace is achieved, Shanghai's silver capital will be absorbed by the inland rural areas, and the sharp drop in silver prices will be greatly eased. Moreover, the rampage of the Communist bandits who disturb the Jiangnan area is caused by the lack of security due to internal warfare. Considering the great impact of this on trade, we cannot help but hope for a swift end to the war.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Chinese Cocoons Imported to Japan Transform into Japanese Cocoons Imported to China <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>About 200 piculs of Japanese Cocoons to be Experimentally Imported</p>
<p>According to the Oriental Daily News, the Shanghai-based Japanese commercial attaché Yokotake telegraphed on the 28th that Chinese customs recently levied a 12.5% ad valorem import tax on Japanese cocoons that were being experimentally imported. At the request of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Industry Association, the National Government plans to reduce the ad valorem tax to 7.5% for a total of 60,000 piculs over six months starting in October and will notify customs accordingly. According to industry sources, only about 200 piculs of Japanese cocoons are being experimentally imported. With the current Japanese market price, a tax of 12.5% is not very cost-effective. However, with a tax of 7.5%, converted at the original price, about 690 taels, a considerable import is expected. However, although a good autumn silkworm harvest is generally expected this year, it is still doubtful how much demand will be stimulated. In short, the fact that only Chinese cocoons have been imported to Japan in the past, but now Japanese cocoons are being imported to China, is worth noting.</p>

<p>The American youth seem to indulge in pleasure and dislike work much more than our own youth. However, their youth community does not lack outstanding, brave, self-sacrificing, and self-respecting individuals, who can shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. Such young people are truly admirable and the real masters of the country. The young woman introduced here is also a leader in this regard.</p>
<p>Miss Lenore Cook graduated from the University of Wisconsin a few years ago. She is about to embark on a three-year round-the-world voyage with four men in a 40-foot yawl. One of the four men is Lenore's husband, a graduate of Northwestern University's School of Journalism and a renowned amateur photographer. Lenore's duties on the ship are as cook and doctor.</p>
<p>According to their planned route, their sailboat, named "Swordfish," will depart from Chicago in the near future, heading to Bermuda, then through the Panama Canal. From there, they will cross the Pacific Ocean, sailing thousands of nautical miles to New Zealand and Australia, then north through the Malay Archipelago, through the Suez Canal, to Greece and Italy, through the Strait of Gibraltar, to the coasts of Spain and France. They will then circumnavigate the continent, cross the Atlantic Ocean to the east coast of America, up the St. Lawrence River, to the Great Lakes. They plan to return to Chicago in 1933 for the exhibition.</p>
<p>Besides the Cooks, the other three are also worth mentioning. The captain, Orr Evans, is a Harvard University football star. Paul, his brother, is also a member of the Yale football team and will serve as the ship's engineer. Donold Dickinson, 21, is a graduate of St. John's Military Academy and will be the ship's radio operator.</p>
<p>The Cooks plan to document everything about their trip.</p>

<h3 id="e183">Unfaithful Love <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Wén Zhì</p>
<p>By Xiàng Péiliáng</p>
<p>In modern Chinese literature, a very bad phenomenon can be observed: most writers are unwilling to adopt a "faithful" attitude towards our literature. They are too "unfaithful" in their creative endeavors, especially in not putting in deep effort into their area of expertise, to create a work that represents their "loyal" dedication to literature. As the saying goes, "Pork head meat is not refined in three ways." Indeed, this is very much reflected in the current literary scene. This is especially unfortunate in the field of drama. There are few authors truly dedicated to drama. Most approach dramatic creation with the attitude of "might as well give it a try." As for those who truly have ambition and constantly strive, I have yet to put a number on them.</p>
<p>I have carefully examined the authors dedicated to drama in the Chinese literary scene. I have also privately wished to extensively collect dramatic works since the New Culture Movement, providing detailed analyses and conducting analyses of all dramatic authors. However, due to the constraints of work, I can only do so vaguely for the time being without much confidence. However, I will not take "mirror flowers and water moon" as my expectation. However, in the past dramatic authors, I certainly have people I admire. Among them, the author of "Unfaithful Love," Xiàng Péiliáng, is one. His attitude towards drama is this: "As long as I can contribute a little to drama, like a farmer digging at least one or two hoe-fulls, even if my efforts may all be in vain, as long as I have made an effort, then I will have no regrets." Yes, when the drama movement's life in China is still very short, it needs "faithful" people like farmers to dig, even if it is only one or two hoe-fulls.</p>
<p>The author himself has admitted that he is going to achieve something in drama, which is indeed something I am delighted about. The author himself also believes that "the entire work of drama requires a long period of hard labor." He tells us, "From the moment an initial inspiration is grasped to the completion of the last sentence, from the intention to perform a play to the fall of the last curtain, there is endless labor involved. People without patience cannot do it." It can be seen how meticulous and hardworking he is when creating plays, fully expressing a complete life. Recently, the author's published works have mostly focused on drama. Novels are rarely seen. However, the hardship of writing plays, according to him, is that "when I was a supplement editor, I often wrote thousands of words in the morning, but none of my one-act plays took less than three months. I don't draft much when I write text and rarely revise it after completion, but plays are revised at least three times." This is truly such perseverance. These are only what I want to prove the author's rigorous attitude when writing.</p>
<p>"Unfaithful Love" contains two plays, "Unfaithful Love" and "Divorce." The author spent about a year writing them. These two multi-act plays are still the author's early works, because the author grasped the idea that "writing plays must start with multi-act plays." Presumably, after these two plays, it seems that the author had already switched to one-act plays. Indeed, the atmosphere of these two plays is somewhat similar to "Fleeting Dream." However, although written before "Depressing Drama," they were published not long before "Bright Drama." I think these two multi-act plays may represent the author's initial style and tendency to work and the techniques of multi-act plays, perhaps they are multi-act plays worth commemorating.</p>
<p>These are all based on the romance of young people, full of irony. In all of Xiang's plays, there is almost a common point, that is, the author's own vitality is very strong. Places about telling his inner feelings seem to be very clearly revealed. That vitality represents the author's own will. "Unfaithful Love" is a three-act play that tells a story in a metropolis. It begins by quoting the first and last sections of Eroshinko's lullaby as a symbol: "(The child cries, dear one cries, he cries in the cradle, although there are good toys, he does not want to be quiet and fall asleep, little child, take your toys, good children at night, are all asleep in the cradle.)" If you carefully savor these two verses, you can immediately know the suggestion that the author wants to point out to people in this tragedy. It is about a twenty-seven-year-old university graduate marrying an innocent and lovely eighteen-year-old girl whom he has known for less than half a year in a scene of unfaithful love. The male protagonist, Long Yingnan, is tired of the floating and wandering life after leaving university, without any sense of belonging. Therefore, he wants to try again one last time. His purpose is to change his inner attention with new stimulation and new pain, so he chooses marriage and love, hoping to make up for past deficiencies. They did not consider whether their personalities understood each other. "(I don't ask how he feels about my love, I'm just going to do this, take care of the present. The love I need, I will create myself.)" It can be seen that the female protagonist, Tao Yawen, has a very superficial view of "love" and has not yet formed any preconceptions.</p>
<p>Soon, Tao Yawen was finally bewitched by the literary writer Wu Mengyin, who specialized in writing about love, and secretly agreed to Wu Mengyin's appointment without her husband's knowledge. Although she knew that her husband's recent actions were often very reluctant and had deep, hidden sadness, she hid it and refused to express it. But she did not try to understand why her husband was so tormented. She wanted her husband not to drink, but did not dissect why her husband was thirsty for alcohol. Finally, Long Yingnan cursed after begging his wife not to go to Wu Mengyin's appointment and being rejected, "(I want to rest temporarily in love, originally wanted love as shelter, to avoid wind and rain and angry tides, the terrible invasion of civilization, but, was it a success or a failure?)" In fact, what Long Yingnan was pleasing his wife with was only for his wife's extravagance and vanity, preferring to make himself very strapped and had to borrow money from friends. He did not want to use a great career to overcome his wife, but wanted to forget the human vocation and social status. He only wanted to serve like a servant serving a master. Naturally, the woman's psychological demands would also be disappointed. However, on the one hand, Long Yingnan's pain was increasing day by day, and on the other hand, Tao Yawen's pressure also matured. In the park, Wu Mengyin used threatening means to woo Tao Yawen, even using a fake pistol to express his determination. Fortunately, Long Yingnan's friend saw through the truth and was rescued. As for this tragedy, it happened on the same day at the same location. Then, Long Yingnan also arrived. He admitted his mistake, the mistake of forcing himself to seek love "(In order to avoid the invasion of irresistible depression, I wanted to spend my whole heart and body in love, so as not to think about other things,)" and said "(I love you... this is the first time I love you, and it is also the last time I love you,)" and suddenly took out a pistol and committed suicide. Although Tao Yawen knew his heart at this time, and especially loved his willful character, it was over, because his pistol really had bullets.</p>
<p>Indeed, Tao Yawen's words are not without research value: "(Although he is considerate to me in every way, I never know his heart. He follows my words and caters to my meaning, but these all seem mechanical. He is reluctantly happy for me, reluctantly smiles, his words are not from the heart... I am still young, I want my own life, a reasonable life, and it is also very proper not to love such a mechanical person.)" (Page 82) This is because the buds of youth have not received true comfort, and everyone will feel bored. Therefore, young people in the times should not seek love solely based on certain demands, but rather on how to support and create this "great love."</p>
<p>"Divorce" is a four-act play. The story is like this: College student Zhang Jiezhi is indifferent to his wife, who, under the old etiquette and system, is said to be "only good for eating, not for showing off," and is eager for a divorce. On the one hand, he is secretly pursuing his love, hiding the fact that he is already married. His plan is to announce the divorce from his wife when love matures, but he will never tell his lover before the divorce, so as not to cause changes in the middle. Unexpectedly, when it was about to mature, a mischievous friend told his lover as much as possible, causing his lover to be furious, thinking that everything he said was a lie. His strictest fifth uncle also found out. When he was discussing the aftermath with that mischievous friend, he came to reprimand him. Therefore, the divorce plan completely failed. But who knew that all the accidents were caused by his friends betting and making trouble! Because of his friends' bets, he ruined the love he was pursuing.</p>
<p>Originally, young people are especially receptive to the baptism of new ideas. How can a marriage without love, arranged by the family, be satisfactory? But if the conditions for the wife are only for pleasure and happiness, "(The most important thing is to be beautiful, and the second is to be able to socialize, dance, sing, play the piano, and be interesting to take out,)" (Page 104) then it would be too ignorant and too boring to abandon one's own wife. I also believe that if things have already been done, one should also think about the future of one's own wife. In this era of transition between the old and the new, is this action harmless to her? Because the shackles of the old society have numbed her entire thinking. In the end, the only thing left is "(suicide)." Then, is it possible to remove one's personal position?</p>
<p>In general, these two plays are not a failure. The dialogue is very smooth, the intention is also very profound, and the structure is also tight. However, I think that compared with the one-act plays written by Xiang Jun since then, they seem to be a little worse. The expression of his one-act plays can be seen everywhere to be more powerful than multi-act plays. This is my personal opinion, what do you think, Xiang Jun?</p>

<p>— Tāng Bīn</p>
<p>By Mù Hóng</p>
<p>The "Hurricane Movement" suddenly appeared in Chinese literature, it seems to have been several years ago. Regarding this type of work, at that time, I loved to read, in addition to Peiliang's plays and novels, also Mu Hong's poems and prose, because Mu Hong's works have a new style, neither imitating Western writers, nor imitating ancient Chinese literary works, only expressing himself, such a spirit of creation, really makes us admire. In other words, this kind of literature full of true life, in China, which is called a backward culture by foreigners, needs to be produced in large quantities, but unfortunately, as far as I know, there is only Mu Hong who is still working hard recently.</p>
<p>Needless to say, his recent works have made even more satisfactory progress in art. I see that he does not write his works carelessly, between each sentence, it is clearly understood that he has spent a lot of energy. In terms of form, he always tends to be new. This article "Wind in the Wilderness" makes us more and more satisfied, it is really gratifyingly novel.</p>
<p>This article is divided into two sections, each section is divided into several subsections, full of rich poetic meaning, truly, rather than saying that he is a new form of novel, might as well say that he is a new form of lyrical poem, because the author is full of imagination, and is best at writing prose and lyrical poetry, as long as people who have read his works will believe it without any doubt.</p>
<p>Because what he wrote is a long poem, he naturally infused a lot of profound symbolism, in order to make a work have superhuman vitality, so that readers with slightly weaker appreciation ability cannot understand what he wrote, but can stubbornly hold on to an unusually enthusiastic heart, no matter what, to make you read it in one breath, and feel that it has a special style, this is a new masterpiece full of profound allegory, this article "Wind in the Wilderness" is of course also like this, now we can carefully look at what he wrote.</p>
<p>We are now desolate, desolate as water, we ourselves must pray, (Do not allow ice to freeze or disappear,) cool water can still boil and steam up,</p>
<p>What is this, it is obviously writing prose poems full of upward consciousness, although it is talking about the desolation of life, but then he imagined that (Cool water can still boil and steam up,) this is how humorous and profound the meaning is, so that we will not feel an unusual monotony when we read it, in these very simple words,</p>
<p>Our body is a lost sheep, no need to look for the old nest again, those who look for the old prison are not seen much, who said, (already cut off the waist,) today's matter, just our heads and bodies are so hard, can we exchange it for a comfortable bed to sleep a dull sleep, the lively gatherings of old friends are really courteous, we respectfully thank you for your disturbance, we still want, in the hands of peaceful people, will give a little true friendship, when not giving a bed, give a few skinny horses to run—we have been away from the battlefield for a few days, and now the flesh on our thighs is growing, itching to race a thousand miles, the moon shines on the ground, but the horse, really cute, fell off the battlefield several times, were all turned over by our jump, jumped on its waist, the enemy is in front swallowing bullets and drinking blood, we, run all the way—putting the horse in front like chasing sparrows, happy and eager, today lazy and forgot the horse, forgot, our precious baby, friends, you give us favors, when not giving a bed, give a skinny horse to run, and try the blood in the battlefield to jump, a tornado-like horse, a roll of turbulent waves is our heart, in the past crazy flying and rushing,</p>
<p>Heaven and earth choked their voices and did not dare to be暴躁…</p>
<p>This section is really written cute, in the tone is sonorous and harmonious, no less than a beautiful prose poem with rhyme, in the words, is how refined, definitely not out of the ordinary hand, carefully read down, very much like singing a great war song, prompting young people to run to the front line of the battlefield, to strive to kill the enemy, only forward can get the comfort of life, only struggle can see the light, this is the fact given to us by history, but in modern literary works, with such a forceful and beautiful writing, there are really not many, (Wind in the Wilderness)'s author, also nakedly expresses it between the lines, proclaiming it before our eyes, originally, no successful heroes and outstanding people in ancient and modern China and foreign countries, have not struggled out of ten thousand difficulties, in fact, young people in general, should never be willing to fall behind, all day long confused and dreaming of unearned dreams, now is the time of angry horses galloping, it is really not allowed for young people to continue to be so unmotivated and mixed up, at least, we read the section of prose poetry containing force and beauty quoted above, and feel that there are such thoughts,</p>
<p>We can even read this new form of novel by the author as a lyrical war song, because poetry is the most moving to readers, especially the rhythm is sonorous, and the emotions are heroic and passionate, great war songs are really rare in China,</p>
<p>The facts of the whole article are very complicated, the beginning is writing (Many hearts are entangled with a lover, but the lover is now dead,) hoping to bring a message, to know this message, of course, only from (the graveyard) or (the ghost gate) can be obtained, in fact, these many passionate hearts like fire, must strive upward, rush forward, later the protagonist in this article realized this point, and jumped on the horse, ran to the battlefield, (like the wind in the wilderness, blowing and singing to himself,) inside also mixed with many descriptions that promote people upward, finally, needless to say, it is to get a different success, as in the sixteenth section, there is already such a writing, (The revolution has succeeded,) people's hearts sing and rejoice, you go to Tibet in the west, I throw myself into the East China Sea to embrace the bright moon) which contains the meaning of unlimited life,</p>
<p>What we most envy is that the author divided this long lyrical poem into several sections to describe, each section has a new style, different charm, so that readers never tire of reading, so, the author wrote this article (Wind in the Wilderness) really spent a lot of thought and effort, indeed, (Mu Hong uses his popular atmosphere to write the inner petition, the mood is deep and quiet, the words are beautiful, and what is even more unique is that, in that deep quiet and beauty, he spits out a powerful and desperate breath, Wind in the Wilderness is his unique style of work), it is most appropriate to recommend Mu Hong with these words, because his works have real value, we may as well read another section of it, to make the end of this article, I think those who love his works also agree,</p>
<p>Life after life I can not forget your loyalty, birds flying and animals walking, how can they be the same as my drifting feelings, now I only use your body, but I follow your mood on the way,</p>
<p>On the way, you must walk vigorously, a living person is really useful, I love myself in the living lover, and I am willing to help him with brave blood,</p>
<p>My soul has been awakened by you again and again, this is like the human affection of the living, why should we be separated by hugging and kissing, I still have a living human heart, then please take this living heart back, and it is not in vain for you to indulge here for a few days, our hearts were originally the same, and will all be completed on this unfinished journey,</p>
