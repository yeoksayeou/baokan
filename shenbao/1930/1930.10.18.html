<p>我們的貢獻</p>
<h3>對人（仰）</h3>
<p>商務印書館總經理王雲五先生，自歐美考察工商管理回國，有一次聽他在工商管理協會講演歐美工商管理狀况，語語精警，尤其於對人對物二層，更多妙語。</p>
<p>對人重於對物，人是活的，變動的，時時進化的，各個不同的，所以對人方面；（一）要注意工作分析，把一個人的性質能力，用精確的測量，測量好了，纔定他何種工作，得何種報酬，此種按程工資，無非使第一等人，不做第二等事，以减損興味，亦不使第二等人，做第一等事，以減損效能。（二）規定工作標準，把許許多多工人，用詳細的方法，規定工人工作標準，過標準的奬勵，不到標準的。分别减資，（三）研究工作效能，怎樣人做怎樣事，纔有效率；怎樣事配怎樣人去做，纔能事半功倍。非有改革的精神，科學的方法，客觀的研究不可，總之從生理方面，務使服務的人，不但不感疲勞，而反大增效率，從心理方面，務使服務的人不但發生興趣，努力工作，而且樂於研究，日求技術的進步。對人不難，難在有研究，有設計，有思想，有魄力，有手腕底統率全部的專門人才。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>德國政府宣布方針</h3>
<p>德總理在國會宣布政府方針。一則曰。國家欲達到重獲完全自由目的。必非激烈與冒險政策。所能有濟。再則曰。政府决不容軍隊捲入政治漩渦。當此危急之際。務望全國學習忍耐與自制云云。是其對於外交方針。絶對主張和平。而不容政黨所倡之强硬政策。已顯然可見矣。夫德國政黨間。近欲利用國民急求恢復戰前狀態之心理。高唱修改和約廢止楊格計劃及不惜犧牲以達目的之論調。固可博一般人之同情。然於邦交發生鉅大危險。則殊未有所計及。世界各國以此問題關係之大。不能不知其政府所以應付之態度。今德政府之表示如此。亦可使世界人心爲之稍安矣。</p>
<p>雖然。德政府此種主張。决不爲左右兩極端黨所同情。中央黨與社會民主黨等。果能結合一致以贊助政府。而得多數之勝利與否。則尙須視以後議會之形勢。故德政府此次所宣佈之大方針。究竟有無效力。今尙未能預言也。夫德政府之欲重獲完全自由與减輕負擔之心理。亦與一般之德國人同。惟欲達此目的之手段。則有急激與和緩之别。在此人心趨向和平之時代。倘德人急欲求勝。不擇手段而行。其於德國前途之危險。亦甚大矣。</p>

<h3>德總理宣佈行政方針</h3>

<p>定下星期票决</p>
<p>國社黨發表驚人之政策</p>
<p>引起各方責難</p>
<p>五金工人罷工轉呈嚴重</p>
<p>與警發生衝突</p>
<p>▲路透社十六日柏林電　德總理白魯寗博士、今日在國會中宣佈行政方針、謂德國内政外交之大目的、在恢復國家自由、白總理對於資金外流、痛加指斥、謂其傷害德國信用、且謂縱以極不愉快的犧牲之代價、亦必成立國家經濟之恢復、總理又言及解除軍備事、謂德國已被强迫的解除軍備、但他國則尙未依照凡爾塞和約裁减軍備云、白總理發言時、共產黨與棒喝黨時加阻撓、農黨提出不信任外長之動議、現已决定明日辯論此案、</p>
<p>▲國民社十六日柏林電　今日下午德總理白魯寗在國會宣佈政府方針、聽者座爲之滿、日皇弟高松宫親王夫婦亦往參觀、左右兩極端派時作譏刺聲、但輒爲政府黨議員喝采聲所掩、政府宣言略謂恢復國家財政之均衡、乃今日减輕一切困難之要素、故政府决意用全力厲行財政整理計劃、國家正在危急之秋、各界人民必須先公後私、爲國犧牲、政府决意首先抑减一般物價、藉除各業恢復上之一大障碍、下月一日將使煤價首减百份之六、以爲倡導、至於外交問題、必先謀内政安定、而後能有所建樹、今日外交政策之最大目的、即在使國家重獲完全自由、惟欲達到此種高尙目的、惟有出以和平方法、必非激烈與冒險政策之所克有濟、故凡屬冒險與感情用事之政策、顯然非政府所能接受、自國際專家决定楊格計畫以後、全世界皆呈衰頽景象、德國尤甚、當各國討論賠欵問題時、確是忽視此種事實、一切未免多從原則上着想、德國固完全準備履行其義務、但若至賠欵足以危及其經濟基礎與人民生活標準時、則亦不能忍受、倘世界經濟衰頽、與德國國内困難繼續不已、則德國爲自保計、亦將被迫照楊格計畫規定、以圖補救、前協約國家未能履行凡爾賽和約内義務、如軍縮等有利於德國之條件、致德國亦不得不照和約所許完成其國防、良可惋歎、但政府决不容軍隊捲入政治漩渦、當此危急之秋、務望各黨與全國人民捐除意見、一致合作、以謀國家之興復、觀於日前選舉結果、德青年似已開始懷疑現行政制之效能、故於此際尤當學習忍耐與自制云、</p>

<h3>張學良將駐節北平</h3>
<p>▲東三省政制亦將改組</p>
<p>瀋陽通信、張學良經中央政府之敦促、已於九日就任陸海空軍副司令、今後東北方面、擁護中央、當有進一步之表示、在中央委任張氏爲副司令之意、一以酬張擁護黨國之功、一則令張收拾北方善後、張旣就職、遂於最近幹部會議議决、張日内即當啓節入關、趨駐北平、其陸海空軍副司令部設置地點、亦定在北平、已派專員前往籌備行轅、届時並擬邀蔣總司令赴平會晤、協議一切、張氏赴平期、在旬日内决即實行、現已編制第三軍、軍長爲胡毓坤、擬將該軍編制成立、隨帶入關、或先帶該軍之一部、至張學良離瀋後、東北邊防司令長官任務、暫由張作相代理、同時黑龍江省主席萬福麟、熱河省主席湯玉麟、哈爾濱特區長官張景惠等、亦即離瀋各返原任、至是東北對於大局、在擁護中央目標下、可謂已告一段落、至前負重大使命之上海特别市長張羣以任務已畢即於十一日啓程赴大連、轉由海道回京覆命、吳鐵城則因赴平辦理黨務、亦定於十二日西上、關於中央與東北此間所有接洽事務、統歸方本仁辦理、</p>
<p>另一消息、東北年前易幟、因種種關係、如東北政務委員會、東北邊防司令長官、吉江副司令等職之設、均爲一時權宜之計、與國府所訂之組織及制度上、似有不合、茲聞張學良氏、於就任陸海空軍副司令前、關於上項、曾與張作相萬福麟湯玉麟等討論數次、以東北與國府、現旣趨於一致、則政務委員會擬予取消、即實行各省軍民分治、一切惟中央之命是聽、至陸海空軍副司令就職後、東北邊防司令長官一職、將贈張作相、惟張作相尙再三堅辭不就、果至實現時、則張之駐吉副司令、即予哈特區長官張景惠、而以熙洽陞任特區長官、又對軍民分治問題、某要人保薦誠允爲吉林省主席、榮厚爲黑龍江省主席、其熱河主席湯玉麟、將被任爲熱綏駐軍司令、不日即可發表、因東北一二兩軍、業已進駐平津各地、刻正向平漢平綏沿線推進、將來綏遠、亦必歸入東北範圍之故、以上各節、是否醖釀成熟、或日後尙有他種變化、均未能定、姑誌之以覘其後、（十一日）</p>
<h3>最近外交界要訊</h3>
<p>▲中英交涉　此次英公使藍普森來京、將中英間重要懸案解决數件、厦門英租界、已實行退還、威海衛已交還中國、退還庚子賠欵換文已簽字、凡此皆中英交涉之要訊也、</p>
<p>查厦門英租界、並無明確之規定、其起源由於道光二十二年七月間中英條約第二欵、規定准英人在厦門地携眷居住通商貿易、又道光二十三年八月間中英通商善後條約第七欵、規定准英人在厦門地方租賃房屋基地、由英國管事官通報地方官轉告立案等語、至道光二十四年八月遂由厦門地方官與英國商妥、將厦門之南校場及水操台兩處、作英租界地、此即爲厦門英租界之起源、該兩地距離厦市碼頭頗遠、英商營業、頗爲不便、乃續租一段、計全部面積長約九十丈、其性質僅可謂租地而不得謂爲租界、厦門租界工部局之組織、始於光緒三年、其規模極小、不能與漢口九江鎭江等處相提並論、至民國十四年五卅事件發生、厦門英領爲謀保護英僑起見、乃容納華方之意見、將工部局巡捕裁撤、所有租界内管理權、完全交由中國警察接收、此後所謂英租界者、僅有空名而已、故此次收回之手續簡單、易契事畢、即可謂實行收回矣、</p>
<p>中英庚欵換文、係於九月二十二日簽字、規定該欵自一九二二年十二月一日起應付之庚欵、英國政府、俟必要之法案經會議通過後、即將全數交還中國政府管理、中國政府即將交還欵項之大部份、創立基金、作整理及建築鐵路之用、並投諸其他中國生產事業、作爲借欵、應交付利息、並規定組織購料委員會、在英購買材料、作中國修築鐵路之用、此外並確定在該項内撥二十六萬五千鎊與香港大學、作敎育中國學生之用、又撥二十萬鎊與倫敦中國大學委員會、爲聘請中國名人在英演講及增進中英間文化之用、換文之内容、大致如此、原文不久即可公佈、至威海衛已接收完竣、茲不復贅、</p>
<p>▲中俄交涉　中俄正式會議、已於本月十一日正式開會、此次會議範圍、已較前議擴大、除中東路問題外、復交通商等問題、亦在討論之列、我方主張第一步先討論中東路問題、俟有結果、再議他案、届時中央將增派專家四人赴俄京、襄助會議之進行、</p>

<p>▲保僑問題　關於南洋和屬將增加入境稅事、外部已屢次分别提出抗議、近據駐和使館呈復、謂南洋和屬地政府參事院、爲補充預算起見、將入境稅由一百盾增至一百五十盾、定明年一月一日實行、此事參事院已呈和政府審核、現已由和拓殖部發交該參事院再行討論、尙未完全决定、現已向和政府抗議、請其切實取消此項擬議、以顧全兩國之交誼、此外南洋和屬政府、又有增加居留證印花稅之擬議、現已並案向和政府抗議、最近南洋和屬、又有對入境華僑、定種種限制及担保等項、若果實行、則赴和旅客、勢必虚費若干時日及金錢、在和屬政府、亦非待遇友邦人民之道、已由外部訓令駐和代辦、向和政府提出嚴重抗議矣、</p>

<p>本年五月、我們歐行的消息、竟傳播至南洋了、爪哇方面、鑒於樂華去歲成績的非常優異、所以來電邀我們在分發征歐時、提前一個月的時候、順道再到爪哇、表演、我們覺得再游爪哇、一方面可趁這機緣、多得練習和合作、一方面也可以藉收入以鞏固經濟後盾、思想再三、總以爲是有益無損、於是、樂華便委我馳往接治、而抱搜集人材那個責任、放在李君的肩上、因爲　李君和各方球員都有交誼、澳行也是由李君召集的、駕輕就熟、正非李君不行、</p>
<p>我南行接洽是很快捷而滿意地結束、同時李君抱病東渡扶桑、在遠運中和多球友也接洽妥善、未完的職務、祗屬於很少數了、六月中旬、李君先來南下、擬和那未參加遠運的港方好於面洽、港中的球星、是分隷於華南中華兩會的、我們憑着友誼好感上着想、多餘地去减把他們的球員參加遠征的志願通告一聲、中華的態度、陽若不聞不問、陰却有少數竭力破壞、竭力阻止他們的球員的參加、甚而用恐嚇的言語來使球員退出結果、接洽妥善出的孫吳二君、竟無充份理由地於最後五分鐘推辭不往、矢志參加的陳曹二翼、竟因爲各行其志便和破壞者、生了意見了、至於南華方面呢、南華的感情、素來和樂華是有進益層的關係、我從爪哇北返過港那時、也曾和他的前任主席何君和前任足球主任劉君有懇親切的商榷、伊們也表示極端贊成、並口貫上應允竭力的幫助、不同過時南華球隊也要作短時期的（英屬）南洋行、所以、應允參加遠征的三位南華球員、必須在將來南華戰事結束後、才可趕來爪哇和我們全隊集合、我們本着好感上的關係、遂極端的信任無他變故了、又誰想得到他們調虎離山、别有謪詐存乎其間呢、</p>
<p>七月的五日、我們集合了港方的曹陳梁三君、凑成一軍之數、便從香江升帆南向了、我們不敢多帶球員、是因着南華將來有三位參加、陳鎭和君遲一星期便可趕上會合、還有在出發歐行那時、從南洋英荷兩屬的華人好手裡再邀三四位豈不是很妥善的預算嗎、</p>
<p>人算不如天算、我們因着傷病相繼、戰期緊迫、和受了南華反約的打擊的數種原因、竟在南洋失敗了四次、成績遠遜去年、於是却觸動了南洋僑界的同情、和各球會的眞情的匡助、把將來征歐的人材難題解决了、國外的愛國心、常常是比較國内來得眞誠熱烈、政治如是、體育亦然、我們那時在失望中而有這種的愛護、委實是感激萬千、</p>
<p>擱淺的惡魔發現了、惡魔發現的主因、是因爲我們的自信力太堅、我們自信以爲這種純粹業餘運動、無非是增進邦交、聯絡好感、總是有利無弊、各種手續是用不着太認眞的、况且、前時哈利士也曾說過、他說英倫總會許可了便用不着憂慮、因爲港滬足球會都在英總會權力之下、總會答應歡迎招待、便可通順無阻了、因此我們便把手續忽視了、萬想不到忽視了此種手續、竟成爲擱淺的禍根、</p>
<p>當我們在南洋預備依期出發赴歐的當兒、英總會鑒於我們的隊伍、是由港滬星爪四處組成的、港滬星三方球會、都是附屬份子、所以英總會很不關乎握要地發了三通電報、分詢此三處球會、上海總會去電說並不反對、星洲方面也表示贊同、惟有香江總會、却因着本身的經濟關係、和受着一部任破壞者的慫恿、竟覆電說不能贊成、於是英倫方面便生了很大的疑團、來電我隊囑我們延緩兩星期然後出發、</p>
<p>全隊一度會議之後、我們覺得解釋是來不及的、不如索性覆電英倫、說我們這次球隊、是祗集合滬星爪三處健者而成的、香港方面未有球員參加、香港總會的同意、便無關輕重了、我們說香港没有球員、是因爲曹君前時是三育的健將、陳君最近曾助樂華、兩位均可算是滬方球員、而梁君個人、也大可算是樂華份子、因爲業餘球員是可隨意隨地的賽球、去届在港、焉知來届不在滬嗎、覆電去了後、我們以爲可告無事了、實料不到英倫力面的保證者、竟因港方無人參加、而對我們的實力發生了惶恐心、再進一步而有請我們展期至明春二月、再事整頓的電報、於是束裝待發的我們、亦惟有向歸途那一條路走、</p>
<p>以上便是此番的事實了、我覺得如果香港方面能不作梗、能像滬星兩會的不表示反對、這次的歐美行一定獲得很滿意的結果、因爲人材的難題是很容易解决了、我們得着南洋各華會的互相扶持、把能請假的上乘好手都盡量借給我們、守門有星洲埠際代表楊阿九、後方有爪哇選手張緒龍、星洲埠際代表蔡文禮徐阿輝、前線有吉隆坡埠際選手葉松齡、馬來華選手陳美安、和星洲埠際選手馮文勳等君、再加上我們原有的勢力、雖然不敢說可多得勝利、但是最低限度也可給外人一良好印象、據我眼光看起來、香港方面用得着的、也不過在三四之數罷了、所以照實力而而、這番的人材也可算得包含國手十之七八了、將來再事組織、能否再有這樣的勢力、我眞不敢預斷、</p>
<p>遠征隊返國的聲浪、自然是邀了不少帶着憐惜的同情心、但是幸災樂禍的也大有人在、伊們的用意和居心、眞使人百索不解、最近竟有疑慮到球員受薪的、香港總會且進一步停止曹陳梁三君的賽球權、他們本何理由而指三君是受薪、也使我莫明其妙、因爲我們這番各員的待遇、是本着澳行的老例做去、澳行無碍業餘、這次自同一轍、雖然樂華是經濟上得着很滿意的佳果、但是、這全是會中公產、將來是用在發展會務的、與任何球員無關、球員所得的、不外是應有的車馬費罷了、</p>
<p>眞的、在我國的社會上是非是非常的多、就是體育界一途來講、也逃不出這個常例、我以爲無論甚麽事情、如能對得起良心、便可抱着大無畏的精神幹下去、成功失敗、和他人的毁譽、都用不着斤斤計較、又何况、我們幹這種事業、是預備着無限的犧牲呢、</p>
<p>遠征雖然擱淺了、但是繼續航行、還有辦得到的可能、我們這番目的未達、但是用了不少的金錢和魄力、總算替後來者在遠征途徑上、打破了一重難關、我希望全國體育協進會、將來能把此次的死灰再燃起來、把中國的新青年精神、灌輸到那常呼我們爲病夫的外人腦袋裡、那嗎、我們這次雖然失敗、但到底有人繼續成功、也可得着一點安慰、我爲甚麽要提議體協會去辦呢、爲的是體協會爲我國體育最高機關、將來和英倫方面接洽、正可免却像這次般要得着港星滬三處的贊同那種障碍、而且、用體協會的名義去召集人材、我想一定有滿意的結果、遠征繼續升帆便是我至誠的祝語、</p>
<p>海上的足球季又開始進行了、樂華的一部份健者、因着學校的關係、轉隸眞茹效力了、樂華受着這樣的打擊、實力上自然相差很多、樂華到底能否成軍、是很多愛護者的一種疑問、還有神經過敏者、竟說、樂華裡面生出意見了、足球界現出裂痕了、那統是很無意識的一種論調、手以爲樂華無論如何、一定要繼續地參加下去、因爲我覺着雖然現在將原有勢力分薄是雙方均難有優異成績的、不過、現在却多了十一個位置來訓練後起、將來的造就、一定未可限量、所以、此種分道揚鑣、殊途同歸的辦法、是再好没有的了、</p>
<p>往事重提、我是素來極端反對的、不過這次我却要破例了、南華體育會和我們關於此番的是非、我却要借這裡未盡的篇幅來講兩句我殊不想重提的話</p>
<p>南華和樂華一向的友誼　誰也知道是非常深厚的、我們每次過港、都得着南華的熱誠招待、大有彼此一家的氣象、又誰料得到因着這番遠征的事、却生出了無限的是非呢、</p>
<p>當我在爪哇接洽妥善途返申江那時、在港本着兄弟輩的態度、很不客氣地和那時的主席和足球部主任何劉二君商酌、却承何劉二君不棄、滿口贊同、表示合作的誠意、就是七月初我們出發過港、他們在南華茶會席上也很誠懇地表現互相提携的意思、後來到了南洋我便親身去見南華的領隊何余二君、問他們戰事何日結束和球員們何日可以參入我們隊内、不料到了那時、何余二君又推說會内未有指示、不能照辦了、我見他們此種態度、是有意存心如此、多講也無補於事、於是我祗得顧而之他、</p>

<h3>日米運滬後</h3>
<p>▲第二批又將運來</p>
<p>▲日人方面消息　國聞社云、第一批日米一萬八千三百石、運抵上海後、因市府當局、議决取締、形勢不佳、原定第二批運滬日米、現已改變方針、中止運滬、以防扣留、昨據日人消息、第二批運華日米、約二萬石、已於昨日、由大阪裝三菱公司輪船、運往香港、即在該處進口上岸、因香港尙未查禁也、惟担數及船名、異常秘密、將來仍須轉口運滬云、</p>
<p>▲葉惠鈞氏意見　新聲社云、日米運華銷售、已經社會局嚴令禁止、新聲社記者、昨特往訪米業領袖葉惠鈞、詢其對於此事之意見、據葉氏云、本年因本國内米產費收、價格已經降落、但穀貴固傷民、穀賤則傷農、如果日米大批來華、使米價日益低落、則來年農產、勢必大受影響、其結果且不亞於穀貴傷民也、至日米來華、完全以中國爲銷售陳米之尾閭、根據日本農林省十九年秋議案、（一）由米穀特别會計運用資金七千萬元、收買新穀三萬石以上、（二）把政府所有的陳米二百二十五萬石、情願損失一點、賣給中國歐洲等處、（三）以相當的低利資金、借給種田人、免其急於買物、（四）調節台灣朝鮮所出之米、防止滿洲米輸入朝鮮、（五）限制外米入口令有效時期、再行延長一年、（六）防止暹羅米及北米輸入、又在第三案出售政府陳米二百二十五萬石項下、已經决定在神户倉庫内、提出十萬石、作爲樣本、交三井洋行運到上海出售、還有二百十五石、陸續運來云云、可見日本政府、對於米糧問題、一方面禁止外米運入、一方面又大批將陳米運出、吾國爲保護本國農民起見、對於日米來華、自當嚴行制止云云、</p>
<p>▲社會局員談話　華東社云、關於日米運華一事、日來各界、紛謀抵制、華東社記者、昨特走訪市社會局、當由第四科孫君接見、詢以抵制日米之辦法、據孫君謂、刻下此事、社會局方面、業已决定兩種辦法、一爲積極的、則已呈文市府、轉請中央行政院、設法命令海關、加重日米之進口稅率、務使日本米價、高於華米、則我國民衆、雖不禁止其購買、亦當望望然而却步、惟此事中央行政院方面、尙未批示、故積極辦法、未嘗實行、至於消極方面、則就市社局範圍以内、如命令米行同業、停止購買、碾米各廠、不得代碾、同時社會局方面、並派職員多人、向市内碾米廠各米行秘密調查、是否有私買並私碾之舉、依目下調查所得、則自命令刊佈以後、業已絶跡、至於日米之調查及辨别方法、殊爲易事、蓋日米來華、大率存積過久、已發黃色、雖經碾白、亦不敵華米遠甚、且日本方面、並無碾米廠、運來者純屬糙米、必須經碾米廠碾白而後、始可出賣、故調查方面、不至發生困難、至於日本當局、曾數數申明此事、謂日米運華、係因日本經濟恐慌之故、爲保護其農民起見、所以對華輸出、要求諒解云云、惟際此我國年豐物阜之秋、我國方面、自不能接受其請求、蓋彼國因經濟關係、出售米糧、藉以保護農民生計、則我國之農民、我國當局、亦應予以充分之保護、若使外米擾亂米價、我國之農米生計、亦將發生恐慌也、孫君又謂日來米價、依昨日最高價格、最上白米已跌至十五元八角、未始不受日米來華之影響、故社會局方面、擬竭力設法保持其在十五六元之間、不使下跌、蓋如再下跌、則内地農民、勢必大受影響、明年春耕、將不敢再種米穀、則明年勢必發生米荒、社會當局負保護農民救濟民食之責、故保持米價、即所以保護農民救濟民食之至意云云、</p>
<h3>蕭案交涉擴大</h3>

<p>▲警察（問一個乞食的人）—你姓甚名誰。住在甚麽地方。乞人—　。你要知道我的姓名住址麽。我呌做老百姓。住在露天第一號。倘承枉顧。不必敲門。儘自進來好了。</p>
<p>▲數學敎師—孩子們。譬如這裏有一隻碟子。裝着一個蛋糕拿進來。由我用刀子切了開來。分給你們吃。甲生吃了五分之一。乙生吃了五分之一。丙生吃了五分之一。我自己吃了五分之二。那麽還餘多少。</p>
<p>一學生—先生。還餘一隻碟子。</p>
<p>▲母（訓伊的小女兒。）—你們女孩子家。從小兒就該知道禮貎。譬如你從樓梯上下來。一定要輕脚輕手。不做出一些兒聲響來。你明白麽。</p>
<p>女—我明白了。此刻上樓去試試。（上樓去了。稍停重又入室。）</p>
<p>母—這一回就好了。你走下樓來。我並没有聽得聲響。</p>
<p>女—母親。我是從樓梯的闌干上瀉下來的。旣下來得快。又没有聲響。</p>
<p>▲男—我有一句重要的話問你。已預備了一禮拜了。</p>
<p>女—你趕快問吧。那回答你的話。我已預備了好幾個月了。</p>
<h3>吳稚暉演說摘雋</h3>
<p>— 戞鳴</p>
<p>西子湖邊。舉行國慶大會。各機關各學校各工廠參加者何止五萬餘人。是日天容如笑。熙熙嘷嘷。一種壯嚴熱烈之空氣。充滿全會塲。到會人物。除中委陳果夫程建廳長周財廳長及黨部執委諸人外。而當年定名「雙十節」之吳稚暉氏。於參加省府開會後。即乘七號汽車趕到。吳秃其髮。御元直貢呢馬褂。當登台時。攝影記者爭爲攝影。吳輙起立含笑承之。有時瀏覽宣傳品。即御其古式之銅邊老花眼鏡。其樸實有如是者。於萬人鼓掌聲中起立致詞。亦莊亦諧。語妙天下。濡筆記之。以實本談。</p>
<p>▲頂括括的來路貨　六十年前。中國人見到了碧眼虬兒。終要嚇了一跳。凡是兩腿筆直的。皮膚雪白的。形狀活像猴子一般的。說起話來。大家没有一個不贊成崇拜的。因爲是舶來品。因爲是頂括括的來路貨。</p>
<p>▲爲黃面皮爭氣　中國六千年前。就有堯舜黃帝。世界上那一國及得上。大槪各國要到孔子時候。才有一班學者產生。雖則埃及文明亦早。但看他們壁上圖畫。像什麽東西。三民主義是孫中山先生發明的。可說在全世界上再好没有的了。但亦可說六千年來思想之結晶。有了孫中山先生。才爲黃面皮爭口氣。</p>
<p>▲寫上一張保險單　中山先生主義之適用。起碼在一千年以内。是無往而不宜的。如果像鐘表店裏寫一保險單。則絶不猶豫地我可大膽寫上保用一千年。</p>
<p>▲馬克思是什麽東西　馬克思主義牛克思主義。閙得烏烟瘴氣。其理論之不合。不值一駁。只因爲他早生了五十年。自然所見所聞。不及中山先生之淵博。他走錯了路。好比我做了三十年八股文章一樣。</p>
<p>▲張飛牛臯統是代表黑種人　我們不要僅說白種人好。安知過了若干年後。黑種人不會稱雄呢。我們古代的張飛牛臯。統是黑面孔呀。</p>
<p>▲總理遺囑包括憲法全部　講到訓政。舉個例。就是伊尹相太甲。周公相成王。中山先生說過。四萬萬人就是皇帝。也就是阿斗。現在訓政時期是必須四萬萬皇帝統明瞭三民主義。將來開起國民大會來。定下一部憲法出來。來統治中華民國。其實一部憲法。决不是什麽約法哩。天壇憲法哩。還不是包括在總理遺囑中嗎。</p>
<h3>中大贈予樊林兩外人博士學位誌盛</h3>
<p>— 絜非</p>
<p>▲中大創舉　國立中央大學。以比國人樊迪文先生。曁美國人林百克先生。相繼來京。均屬學術湛深。著作宏富。於世界文化。貢獻殊多。對於我國取消不平等條約。及本黨三民主義。尤熱心贊助。盡力宣揚。爰援世界各大學先例。贈予樊迪文先生名譽文學博士學位。林百克先生名譽法學博士學位。事前特經校務會議通過。並組織贈予博士典禮委員會董其事。以屬空前創舉也。</p>
<p>▲彩樓高矗　本月九日下午五時。於該校體育館舉行贈予證書典禮。以次日爲國慶日。故點綴備極富麗。校門之外。彩樓高矗。其上顏曰「國立中央大學贈予樊迪文林百克名譽博士典禮。」而大門之内。其達體育館之甬道。至爲修廣。柳蔭桐幕中。黨國旗與恭祝國慶之紅燈。數以萬計。白日旣逝。則見千百紅星。盪漾月光如水中。使人見之。蓋不勝其清新之感也。</p>
<p>▲姗姗來遲　三時以後。赴會者絡繹於途。迨四時半。懸樓之上。坐客已滿。而後來者猶如潮湧。然一遲再遲。載跂載望。及五時半。兩博士始於掌聲雷鳴中。出現於紅綠繽紛萬花團簇之禮壇之上。</p>
<p>▲校長多才　授憑之前。主席張乃燕校長報告。略如第一段之所叙。先以華文。次以法文。再次以英文。蓋比國用法文。而美國用英文也。</p>
<p>▲樊氏之言　樊氏並爲演講。題曰國際經濟關係。略稱近世以交通利便。乃發生國際間之關係。中國昔爲閉關自給。後爲外人打破。故乃有今日之收回關稅自主運動。余甚盼其立能實現。最近法國倡所謂歐洲聯邦問題。然必先之以經濟聯盟。乃爲今日環境所限。要無望焉。考歐陸經濟。可以列爲兩方。一方爲農業的。一方爲工業的。政治亦緣之而異。歐洲之東部。爲人力與獸力之世界。而西部則馬達之世界。後者用煤用機械。前者用人力用獸力。其進化不同。其强弱乃殊。惟用馬達之世界。乃恃武力與技術以爲之後盾。之二者。歐洲東部可以效之。即其他各洲農業國家。亦皆可以奮起直進。相與抗衡。且更可以電氣應用於農業改良。毋履歐美之故轍。以蹈於帝國主義之錯誤。其所發明。爲全世界福。蓋眞正和平。乃能實現焉。</p>
<p>▲林氏之言　氏稱對樊氏之言。良多感觸。以爲世界國家。足以自給者。凡三。一中·二美·三俄·中國地大物博。猶如一世界。可以自爲生存。徒以受外人之覊束。使不克自由。而國人近頃。頗努力於此。且多所自覺。在朝者尤多以發展中國事業爲急務。殊堪樂觀。又言求學爲獲眞樂。學問無融融洩洩之致者。要非眞學問。若中山先生。非但爲學問。且爲衆人之快樂也。氏嘗於演講之前後。恭向總理遺像行三鞠躬禮。</p>
<p>▲吾道西矣　市黨部代表樓桐蓀氏之言曰。樊林兩先生各持一文憑以歸。不啻各奉吾國一面旗。吾道西矣。惟兩先生皆德高望重。學振中外。今日受此殊榮。分所當然。吾甚願今日座中。三十年後。有兩人各奪一旗以還也。</p>
<h3>由國貨想到西藥</h3>
<p>— 可可</p>
<p>日來上海市舉行國貨運動。國貨國貨。洋洋盈耳。竊意服御日用品。國貨出品漸多。凡屬國民。固宜儘量採用。而醫藥用品。屈指海外輸入者。年甚一年。尤以各種成藥。服食旣便。銷行甚多。試就市塲略一調查。便覺縷指難盡。醫藥雖無國界。顧一念漏巵之巨。當亦寒心。是宜盼藥界有志者。努力創製。俾有以供吾國民之需要也。所幸邇來藥肆。稍知研究。漸有出品。譬如牛肉汁有維他命五四等牌。魚肝油乳白則有九福九星等。麥精牌號尤多。更有一種軋局爾製劑。即取魚肝油精華製成。而無其腥惡者。向來流行於智識階級。爲一般體弱咳嗽及初期肺病者所喜服。向惟舶來物。年銷之數。殊足驚人。近亦有相當之國貨。即所謂補力多者是已。凡此種種。雖祗成藥中一小部份。但望就此以求日益進步。日益發展。由二三種而千百種。由小部份而大部份。並由成藥以及原料。庶幾將來醫療一切。無待外求。斯可以稱提倡之極軌已。藥業諸君勉之。</p>
<h3>意大利美術考察記（四）</h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>（四）彼帝美術館。Palace　Pitti在佛羅稜司唯美河之西。四邊廣塲。館位在廣塲之高原。原來是用巨石建成的一所皇宫。周圍有樹林點綴。從高原望去。可窺市外之遠景。此係佛埠大宫之一。建於一四四四年。從一五五○年至一八九五年。是公爵托斯卡納之私邸。現在雖改美術館。仍歸皇家所有。進館直登三樓。自第一室至第六室。都大壁畫。當公爵住時之裝飾。依然保存。室内之精美。極盡畫棟雕樑之奇。每間壁畫。各有變化。抬頭觀天花板上所繪之石柱子。接連下方之建築。宛如眞物。難辨其假。意大利壁畫。素有名於世界。尤其在宫中及貴族住宅内之壁畫。皆當時名家之傑作。使吾人流連不盡。館内陳列作品。除意大利名畫外。有荷蘭及西班牙的精品二十餘幀。</p>
<p>西班牙和蘭在十七世紀的繪畫。很具特色。但是他們都接受着文藝復興盛期的作風而繼續啟發。西政牙的Morillo。荷蘭的Rubens。都留學於佛羅稜司。其技之猛進。凌駕了當時的意大利。現在此館陳列西政牙及荷蘭之作。皆係昔日宫中收藏之物。極爲名貴。</p>
<p>此館古物較多。繪畫亦不少。但不及奥飛次美術館之完備。佛羅稜司大陳列館。就是奥飛次與彼帝二處。其餘之名作。都散於各敎堂中。欲研究意大利之繪畫及雕刻。兩館之外。尙須探求各寺院之壁畫。方能窺其凈盡。</p>
<p>（五）壳洛司敎堂。St.　Croce該堂在佛羅稜司市内。前面一大曠塲。塲中矗立高一丈餘之詩聖但丁石像。此像是米葛朗的作品。雕出但丁的神情至佳。像之下方有一石臺。置獅子四隻。獅形不按自然所雕。頗有希臘古代之作風。敎堂之右首。另有一古寺。陳列喬督Giollo之大壁畫。下面描「最後之晚餐」。上面描「耶穌昇天」。此畫在歷史上十分名貴。此間入門須購券。與别處不同</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（七十九）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>▲巡游意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（二）</p>
<p>—不死之城—La　Ville　eternelle</p>
<p>六月一日—西班牙名作展與日本現代畫展</p>
<p>羅馬的道路。是因山坡丘陵的高低形勢。而且繞避許多古蹟。所以不免紆迴曲折。與巴黎逼直的大道是絶然不同的。不過。最易使人感到的。就是在巴黎各處的石柱和廣塲上的彫刻甚至噴水池畔的飾物。清清楚楚是仿傚着這古羅馬的遺物。不過將他那形式擴大些罷了。本來如此。就是巴黎著名的拿破侖的凱旋門也不過是羅馬式的擴大的模型。</p>
<p>新美術館的建築。也是非常宏壯的。這仿古典的石造的建築。在兩邊滿飾着輕快的浮雕我們從數十級崇高的石階之上禹步而入。門前分列着許多巨石的廊柱。中央掛起西班牙大師傑作展覽會的大旗。是十分嚴肅而醒目的。旗上就寫着ElGreco，　Goya，　Velazquez.　Zurbaran　Murillo.　De　Ribera,　Lopez,　Lucas.　Carducho,的大名。含着滿足的。微笑的我又泰然走進第二重門。就看見内庭裏陳列着巨大的雕象。已經足夠使我們讚美的光景。向左面一直走進去。就是西班牙展覽會了。走進裏面去。就看見在印本上看見過的格萊可El　Creco的出名的大作「聖彼得之淚」。這一室。大半都是格萊可的傑作。再過去是委拉士貴士。Velazquez瑪利羅Murillo的畫。更進去是倍伊Bayeu迦爾迪柯Carducho黎貝拉Ribera谷牙Goya的畫。最後是洛丕Lopez吕迦士Lucas士魯白朗的畫。全部總數六十六幅。格萊可十幀。瑪利羅四幀。委拉士貴士七幀。黎貝拉四張。谷耶七幀。其餘的記憶不清了。至羅馬不期然而看到這許多西班牙大師的傑作。在我。是出於意表的幸事。雖然我先前也曉得西班牙的畫派。歡喜格萊格。谷耶的畫。可是終没有十二分透澈底味識。現在我於這許多傑作中悟到眞的情味了。尤其是從前讀了他們的歷史和傳記而想像他們的作品的如何充滿着豐饒的生命力的光景。然而無緣親接作品終是徒然的。現在是一一看到了。正是我理解而味識的東西。這也可以算我生平的第一件快事。</p>

<h3>糧食米市續見猛跌</h3>
<p>▲閘北　昨日襄路到源四十餘號、市銷益滯、新粳貨湧續跌三四角、特頂貨開十六元關口、普通悉在十五元半、情勢尙難站立、薄稻行情微軟、羊秈節節下游、昨又見跌三角許、杜尖銷場零拆問津不弱、故價祗小兩角、高貨開十二元半、埠尖客尖悉不開展、步短一兩角、趨勢依然無神、新白元到貨漸接亦疲角半、大盤十四元半、陰元到銷兩淡、高做十四元、</p>

<h3>標粉市風雲險惡</h3>
<p>▲大降稍回：後步看平</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤時、曾發生巨大之風波、因洋麥之報價、又小去六七角、自國外之現麥逐步低廉後、全部分之人心、均已轉動、不但内地帮之多頭、惶恐特甚、即廠家方面、亦幾一致傾向抛出、開盤時因多頭巨量之反賣、致市貨一瀉千里、無可挽救、本月份最低曾低至二兩二錢十一月份至二兩一錢八分、十二月一月份低至二兩一錢九分七厘半、二月份至二兩二錢零七厘半、三月份至二兩二錢一分半、較前日之收價、無形暴落三四五分不等、惟二盤以後、因跌度太狂、空方均乘時競補、故市面亦回振甚烈、迨至下午開盤、因大跌小回、人心已趨平穩、各月份之出入亦無幾、觀後步因小到如是地步、實無再跌之理、當暫呈盤旋也、結果本月份較前日終小一分二厘半、十一十二月份小一分、一二月份小二厘半、三月份未動云、</p>
<h3>期現麥同再狂落</h3>
<p>▲晚市跌風告一段落</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、人心之虚軟、已達極點、因國外之洋麥旣經廠家之訂購、目下現麥之㨮售、又不絶於途、此後小麥之趨勢、當然爲國外所軟化、所以近遠期之多頭、到此環境、已不能作困獸之鬥、祗好趁勢了結、因多頭之競出、市面遂不可收拾、如十一月份最低至四兩二錢四分、十二月份至四兩二錢二分、與新麥時之標準、已相彷彿、正二三月份亦低至四兩二錢六分、又見當時局面之不佳、大有麥不值錢之槪、迨至下午開盤、因粉市之略回、及空頭之爭補、市勢稍見回好、但與前日之收價、仍形小落、結果十·十一月份跌四分、十二月份跌三分、正二三月份跌四分、現麥市面、亦見狂跌、中次更甚、最低已四兩進關、低至八錢右左、全市開管店東台高郵麥四千餘包、由信大辦去云、</p>

<p>▲東貨細嗶嘰月華絨續見上漲</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（十四）北山廟會與歌女</p>
<p>在我們旅行期的最後三日、正趕上全吉林城市民熱狂的集合似乎虔誠的舉行廟會的日期、（大槪就是浴佛節、但我没有去詳細打聽、不知廟裏的菩薩是佛還是神仙、）這也是同學們認爲最高興的事、</p>
<p>的確很熱閙、洋車（即黃包車）馬車人羣把狹隘的馬路堵塞了、雖然北山還離得遠遠的呢、</p>
<p>平日的北山雖然並不是如荒山一樣的冷漠、但遊人總是稀有的、可是在廟會舉行的期間、人幾乎如螞蟻聚合在一塊食物上似的擁擠在山上山下、</p>
<p>事前早有不少商人們在山麓到山腰架起了市塲、在這裏面尤以賣冷熱飲料的茶舍爲最多、並且、每個茶舍裏面都坐滿了遊人、</p>
<p>我們混在人羣中爬上山去、</p>
<p>這些人、女的、男的、老的、小的……在這裏面着時髦衣服的少女占極少數、（在這少數之中、大半是妓女、）由此我們可以想到吉林還是一個淳穙的古城、</p>
<p>到了山半的一座廟裏、廟裏的烟充溢着、我在裏面眞不慣於呼吸、到山上的女人們大多數都要來到廟裏燒一燒香、磕幾個頭、但男人們大多數是來看熱閙、所謂「逛廟會」、如我們就是這樣、</p>
<p>山上山下還有不少遊藝塲、日本人朝鮮人的魔術、西洋鏡、（即看畫片、）京戲塲、和唱大鼓書茶樓、我們就尋了一座唱大鼓的茶樓進去休息和消遣、</p>
<p>我記憶好像在上海有一次在大世界不知是先施樂園裏看見過一次大鼓、這回我得眞切的能夠領略一下北方民衆的音樂與文學了、雖然我没有法子聽得出她們是唱的什麽、</p>
<p>一位年輕的歌女唱完了、一位年輕的歌女又走上台來、她一隻手手指差义地掛着三片木板、一隻手纖纖地、撚着一根箸、卜鼕·鼕·鼕·她開始擊起小鼓、搖起拍板、——鼕·鼕·鼕·托、……於是坐在旁邊的近視眼的老琴師套着銅套的指頭撥動了琴絃、於是從這歌女的紅唇與白齒中間迸出了震動的而穩定的聲音、像唱、但又像在數說、</p>
<p>當她第一聲擊着小鼓、我幾乎嚇了一跳、這位歌女也許是異於其她的、雖然她要比其她的大槪還年幼些、但她在第一下擊着小鼓的這有力的一聲之後、那老琴師似乎也把琴弦撥彈得更有勁些、接着她的唱聲也一樣的有力、宏喨、而且穩定、她能使座上的喧嘩靜止、</p>
<p>……鼕·鼕·鼕鼕·鼕·—這個神經質的歌女手下的小鼓也是神經質的呀、—鼕鼕着、鼕鼕着………</p>
<p>熱哄、喧鬧、擁擠、噪雜……一直到太陽西沈、天邊的彩雲映到山頂變成金的光輝的時候、山上的人羣才稀少下去、尤其是女人們要回家去預備夜膳了、</p>
<p>我們從香爐裏開始燃起香的時候來、一直到香爐只娱出殘燼的烟的時候才回去、</p>
<h3>秋霖之夜</h3>
<p>— 少珍</p>
<p>（上）</p>
<p>榮這幾個月來的確的忙了、漫說寢食的時間給這忙字减少了三分之一、就連下頦和唇際那幾根稀落鬍子長得幾乎有一寸長也没有機會給他找個空兒去剃、他一早扒起床來便一輛黃包車趕到辦事所裏去、回家的時候總在下午七八點鐘之間、很難得是在六時左右回家來、即星期日也從没有一小時在家裏坐過、中飯據說是很隨便地吃些點心的、有時竟連點心都没得吃一直等到晚上回家來才兩頓併作一頓的吃下兩碗飯、而晚飯一吃完、便又拿起筆來在電燈光之下颶颼地向方格紙上寫了、一寫就非到兩點鐘打過老是不肯停筆、就算停筆了又要呼着香烟在思索第二晚寫的題材、有時高興起來就捉住那題材拿起筆來便寫、一寫寫到天亮、許他已經是力竭神疲了才丢下那支鋼筆、呵欠了兩聲把身子倒在床上去、我們婚後的甜蜜光陰給他這麽斷送過去眞是寃枉、而他呢、本來很瘦的面龐這一個月來更見到了焦黃、徼倖他的精神還好、雖然比較更瘦得多而於態度上還依然和平常一樣底沉默温雅和見不到表現出有甚疲勞、但是、我總抱慮他這樣工作下去終於身體上會發生絶大的危害的、每晚老例似地必幾次三番勸他早點兒休息、不了的且留待明日再幹、無奈從不肯聽人規勸的榮哥、終於是絶對地把我規勸他的說話等諸蚊蚋過耳的、我曾因他的執拗嘔過了氣、也曾因他的執拗回過母家、不過啊、這於我們又有甚麽益處呢、後來、我索興跟他在一塊兒忙了、也可說說、每晚總是從旁臂助、但是、讀書不成的我、臂助他甚麽來呢、祇替他謄清點稿子而已、然而、這些、在我、已是極其吃力的了、</p>
<p>榮每夜在家裏所寫的完全都是關於民族主義運動的文藝、其中小說也有、論文也有、劇本也有、關於民族主義文藝運動、榮曾對我說過—</p>
<p>照現在的情勢上講、中國的民族可以說是麻木不仁到極點了、要使他們一一了解了民族的意識、本來不是一件很容易的事、但民族主義文藝運動者所負的使命是時代所授與的、要他們帶着中國的全民族蹈過當前的危機、免除民族間種種的苦難而躋全民族於强盛的地位、使命是如此的重大、責任也是如此的重大、民族主義文藝運動者便不能以爲這是一件很艱苦的工作而不把使命與責任負起和逡巡而不敢前了、便與同志們連合起戰綫抱着大無異的精神而向前孟晉了、他們的孟晉固然是有目標的、就是爲求全民族的自决而將自已犧牲、犧牲、個人的犧牲、本不是一件可恥的事、但須要估定這犧牲的價值在民族上有多少光榮、在因襲上、在傳統上、中國人每個人都是抱定了一個宗旨—爲子孫做牛馬、所以、流毒所及、到現在、中國人也和前世紀一樣底好像一盤散沙、民族</p>
<h2>Page 28</h2>
<p>主義的文藝運動者、在精神上、在努力上、在意識上、固然的、把這種惡思想從各個人的腦子裏抽出來整個地革除、換上了民族的意識、而這一班人的努力方面呢、也固然的、擴大他們的大無畏底精神去爲全民族謀福利、福利、這全民族的福利、在今日的情勢上講、自然是在很遙遠的地方丨許是在他們想得到而望不到的地方、但「行之非艱、祗要努力向前、這地方自容易達到、所以、他們知道了、見到了當前有了危機而並不以爲是危機、他們正因爲知道了、見到了當前有了危機、而要爲着全民族將來的自决而蹈過危機、就從那一天起就呐喊起來向這危機踏上去、他們向這危機踏上去是要、把它踐踏成一條康莊的大路給跟上來的全民族很安穩地走着的、這便是他們一班人努力底中心、現在、他們已然是踏上去了、他們也已然是把這危機踏平了一半了、在他們工作以來、所以、他們全部的成功雖則說不是在今日而是在將來、可他們已在民族中間播下了許多民族意識的種子了、這實在是中國全民族的生機、也實在是中國全民族最最欣幸的事、</p>
<p>「再講到文藝、它原本是在民族的立塲上所形成的意識狀態裏產生出來的、斷没有舍此而產生的文藝、不幸的中國、竟然有了這樣一種的所謂文藝、遂使中國的文藝入了今日如此没落的時期、必然地、成了中國今日全民族的當前的危機、這原因就是思想失却了中心、文化没有了出路、甚麽是思想的中心呢、也甚麽是文化的出路呢、一言以蔽之、民族主義而已、（未完）</p>

<h3>On Dealing with People (Admiringly)</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Yunwu, General Manager of the Commercial Press, upon returning from an inspection of industrial and commercial management in Europe and America, once gave a speech to the Industrial and Commercial Management Association on the state of industrial and commercial management in Europe and America. His words were insightful and incisive, especially regarding the two aspects of dealing with people and dealing with things, where he offered many brilliant observations.</p>
<p>Dealing with people is more important than dealing with things. People are living, changing, constantly evolving, and each individual is different. Therefore, in dealing with people: (1) Attention should be paid to job analysis. A person's nature and abilities should be measured precisely to determine what kind of work they are suited for and what kind of compensation they should receive. This piece-rate wage system is intended to ensure that first-rate individuals are not doing second-rate work, which would diminish their interest, and that second-rate individuals are not doing first-rate work, which would diminish their effectiveness. (2) Work standards should be established. Detailed methods should be used to establish work standards for a large number of workers, with rewards for exceeding the standards and wage reductions for failing to meet them. (3) Research should be conducted on work efficiency to determine what kind of person is effective at what kind of work, and what kind of work should be assigned to what kind of person to achieve maximum efficiency. This requires a spirit of reform, scientific methods, and objective research. In short, from a physiological standpoint, the aim should be to ensure that those who are serving not only do not feel fatigued but also greatly increase their efficiency. From a psychological standpoint, the aim should be to ensure that those who are serving not only develop interest and work hard but also enjoy research and constantly seek to improve their skills. Dealing with people is not difficult; the difficulty lies in having the research, design, thought, courage, and skill to lead the entire process with specialized talent.</p>

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Chairman Wang Shuchang Sworn in Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Hebei Provincial Chairman Wang Shuchang was sworn in at 10:50 am on the 17th. More than 300 guests attended. Wu Tiecheng represented the Central Government in administering the oath and delivered a speech, stating that Yan Yishan spread feudalistic poison, disregarding the people, treating Hebei Province as a vassal state and Hebei's wealth as an outer treasury, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, and exhausting the resources. The strong were forced into battle, and the weak were left to die. The Central Government was concerned about the local situation and ordered the Northeast Army to enter the pass to suppress the rebellion. It appointed Wang as the chairman of Hebei Province to eliminate the tyrannical government, abolish harsh levies, rescue the people from fire and water, and implement the Party's principles to promote local development, so that the people can enjoy peace and happiness, and he hoped Chairman Wang would work hard to achieve this. Zhao Ti, the representative from the Northeast, said that after the military destruction in Hebei Province, all development must be carried out practically. Chairman Wang has extensive knowledge and rich experience and will surely follow the teachings of the Premier, abide by national laws and the Three Principles of the People. Wang replied that Shuchang served in the military and had no political experience, but he would follow the instructions and do his best to serve with conscience and ability. (17th, special dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Wu Tiecheng told visitors: 1. The people of North China have suffered greatly this year due to the military oppression and exorbitant taxes of Yan's army. 2. The expanded conference is a false front for Yan, Feng, and Dai's faction and violates Party discipline. Now the real Party has arrived in Beiping. 3. The only hope of the people is unification, and unification will be achieved when Yan and Feng's power is eliminated. I will stay in Beiping for five days, and after administering the oath to Yu on the 20th, I will return to Shenyang with Representative Zhao the next day, and then take a sea route to Nanjing to report to Chairman Chiang. I will go to Biyun Temple tomorrow or the day after. Zhao Ti said that he came with Wu to administer the oath to Wang and Yu and would return to Shenyang to report.

<p>(Beiping) It is rumored that Zhao Pilian was detained by Shang Zhen. Yan telegraphed Shang to inquire, and Shang replied that he had not heard of this matter, but Zhao has disappeared. Shang has no troops in Beiping, so the story of him detaining Zhao does not seem to be true. (17th, special dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Twelve members of the left and right wings of the Enlarged Committee arrived in Tianjin by car from Baoding this morning. The Northeast's attitude towards all parties and factions is one of non-interference as long as they do not endanger order or oppose the Central Government and the Northeast. Since the economic center of our country is mostly in the concessions and residences of retired officials, it is hoped that they will be temporarily ordered to return to live in Beiping and Tianjin to boost the market. (17th, special dispatch)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The German Government Announces Its Policy</h3>
<p>The German Chancellor announced the government's policy in the Reichstag. First, he stated that the nation's goal of regaining complete freedom cannot be achieved through radical and reckless policies. Second, he stated that the government will not allow the army to be drawn into the political vortex. At this critical moment, he hoped that the entire nation would learn patience and self-restraint. It is evident that his foreign policy absolutely advocates peace and does not allow the hard-line policies advocated by political parties. Recently, some German political parties have sought to exploit the public's eagerness to restore the pre-war state by advocating for the revision of the Treaty of Versailles, the abolition of the Young Plan, and the willingness to make sacrifices to achieve these goals. This may win the sympathy of the general public, but the significant dangers to diplomatic relations have not been taken into account. The world's nations, aware of the magnitude of this issue, cannot ignore the attitude of the German government in dealing with it. The German government's expression in this regard may bring some reassurance to the world's people.</p>
<p>However, this kind of proposition by the German government is certainly not sympathized with by the parties on the extreme left and right. Whether the Center Party and the Social Democratic Party, etc., can unite and support the government and win a majority victory remains to be seen in the future parliamentary situation. Therefore, the effect of the major policy announced by the German government this time cannot be predicted now. The German government's desire to regain complete freedom and reduce the burden is shared by the general German population. However, there is a difference between radical and moderate means to achieve this goal. In this era of peace-seeking, if the Germans are eager to win and act by any means, the danger to Germany's future will be great.</p>

<h3>German Chancellor Announces Administrative Policy</h3>
<p>▲ Seeking National Economic Recovery</p>
<p>▲ Vehemently Condemns Capital Outflow</p>
<p>Agricultural Party Proposes a Motion of No Confidence in the Government</p>
<p>Vote Scheduled for Next Week</p>
<p>National Socialist Party Announces Startling Policy</p>
<p>Provoking Criticism from All Sides</p>
<p>Metalworkers' Strike Becomes Serious</p>
<p>Clashes with Police</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, Sixteenth Day: German Chancellor Dr. Heinrich Brüning announced his administrative policy in the Reichstag today, stating that the great objective of Germany's domestic and foreign policy is to restore national freedom. Chancellor Brüning vehemently condemned capital outflow, stating that it damages Germany's credit. He also stated that the restoration of the national economy must be achieved, even at the cost of extremely unpleasant sacrifices. The Chancellor also mentioned the issue of disarmament, saying that Germany has been forcibly disarmed, but other countries have not yet reduced their armaments in accordance with the Treaty of Versailles. During Chancellor Brüning's speech, the Communist Party and the Beer Hall Putschists repeatedly interrupted. The Agricultural Party has proposed a motion of no confidence in the Foreign Minister, and it has been decided to debate this motion tomorrow.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, Sixteenth Day: This afternoon, German Chancellor Brüning announced the government's policy in the Reichstag. The audience was full, and Their Imperial Highnesses Prince and Princess Takamatsu also attended. Members of the extreme left and right wings occasionally made mocking remarks, but they were always drowned out by the cheers of the government party members. The government declaration stated briefly that restoring the balance of national finances is the key to alleviating all difficulties today. Therefore, the government is determined to implement a financial consolidation plan with all its strength. The nation is in a time of crisis, and people from all walks of life must put the public interest before their own and sacrifice for the country. The government is determined to first suppress general prices to remove a major obstacle to the recovery of various industries. On the first day of next month, coal prices will be reduced by 6% as a leading example. As for foreign policy, domestic stability must be sought first before achievements can be made. The greatest goal of foreign policy today is to restore complete freedom to the nation. However, this noble goal can only be achieved through peaceful means and not through radical or adventurous policies. Therefore, any policy that is adventurous or driven by emotion is clearly unacceptable to the government. Since international experts decided on the Young Plan, the whole world has shown signs of decline, and Germany is even worse. When countries discussed the reparations issue, they certainly ignored this fact, and everything was thought of mostly in terms of principles. Germany is fully prepared to fulfill its obligations, but it cannot tolerate reparations that endanger its economic foundations and the living standards of its people. If the world economy continues to decline and Germany's domestic difficulties continue unabated, Germany will be forced to take remedial measures according to the provisions of the Young Plan in order to protect itself. The former Allied nations have failed to fulfill their obligations under the Treaty of Versailles, such as disarmament and other conditions favorable to Germany, so Germany has no choice but to complete its national defense as permitted by the treaty. It is regrettable, but the government will never allow the military to get involved in political vortexes. In this time of crisis, it is hoped that all parties and the people of the whole country will put aside their opinions and cooperate to seek the revival of the nation. Judging from the results of the recent elections, German youth seem to have begun to doubt the effectiveness of the current administrative system. Therefore, at this time, it is especially important to learn patience and self-control.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, Seventeenth Day: Last night, after a meeting of striking metalworkers, many Communist elements clashed with the police. Gunfire came from the houses, and the police returned fire, clearing the streets. However, people soon opened fire on the police from the windows again. The police station sent reinforcements, and the crowd threw stones to resist. The police then used batons to drive the crowd back and searched several houses, arresting sixty people. At the same time, in the Cologne area, the Communist Party attacked the National Socialist Party's office. The police stopped them, arresting thirty people, and five people were injured.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, Seventeenth Day: The German Parliament began debating the government's policy, which the Chancellor read out yesterday. The vote on the motion of no confidence, which is related to the fate of the cabinet, will be taken publicly after the start of next week. At the same time, the attention of all circles has shifted from Parliament to the strike of metalworkers in Berlin. According to political figures, this strike is actually the final desperate act of resistance by the National Socialist Party. The strike situation has become more serious since this morning. Yesterday, only 50% of the workers at the Siemens factory were on strike, but today, only 800 out of 20,000 workers are still working. In addition, there is one thing that is most astonishing: the National Socialist Party today published its views in the Reichstag, listing various proposals of the party in the political and economic spheres. The proposals are: (1) Limit all official profits and interest to 5%; (2) Prohibit private transactions in future transactions and markets; (3) Create all banks (including the Reichsbank) as state property; (4) Confiscate the property of wealthy private bankers; (5) Confiscate the assets of Jewish immigrants from 1914; (6) Profits made through speculation during the revolutionary period and during periods of rapid price increases and decreases must also be confiscated; (7) With the exception of workers' and small salaries, all senior salaries and wages will be reduced by 15% or more. After the proposed recommendations were published, the right-wing newspapers sympathetic to Hitler were greatly surprised. Other newspapers were also very dissatisfied with the National Socialist Party and criticized them sharply. According to reports, there was a major internal dispute within the party before the election, which was only resolved by Hitler's money. Now that Hitler has suddenly announced this startling policy, it is feared that it will make other important parties even more wary of trying to win over the party for their own sake.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Berlin, Sixteenth Day: The French press is exaggerating the German political situation, making the fearful even more panicked. Only the Victory newspaper published an article by Herr Fèvre, advocating the revision of the treaty, saying that he only has the courage to openly advocate the revision of the treaty because he is a member of the Nationalist Party who loves France. He believes that (1) France should abandon the Saar region and decide on a national assembly of German or French affiliation; (2) Allow the merger of Germany and Austria; (3) Return the old African colonies of Togo and Cameroon to Germany; (4) Revise the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles so that Germany can maintain an effective army; (5) Return the Polish Corridor to Germany. In addition, there are other articles that can at least be regarded as an attempt to reach mutual understanding and remove obstacles to maintaining peace and reforming Europe.</p>

<p>Discussion of Singapore Naval Base Issue Has Begun</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, Sixteenth Day: Although the Imperial Conference has not yet reached the stage of resolution, consideration of various issues is now underway. The procedure adopted by the conference is for the chief delegates to first discuss the issues as usual, and then hand them over to small committees for review and to prepare reports. Now, constitutional issues involving imperial relations have first been considered by the delegates, and then handed over to a small committee chaired by Lord Chancellor Sankey for review. Today, the Sankey Committee held a meeting and formed another subcommittee to review a certain issue regarding the legislation of autonomous territories, and handed over the issue of the form of commercial treaties within the Empire to a subcommittee to review, and exchanged views on the status of autonomous territories when signing treaties. As for the proposals to promote trade within the Empire, the chief delegates have continued to discuss them, some of which are of great importance, so they must be discussed carefully before being submitted for review. The following matters are currently under detailed study: (1) Preferential tax rates for imperial goods, especially the Canadian delegation's proposal to exchange one-tenth of the preferential treatment; (2) A quota allocation system for autonomous lands goods, especially wheat, imported into England; (3) Bulk purchases and imports of goods; (4) Ways for British industrialists to obtain greater opportunities to trade with autonomous lands. After this morning's discussion, the above-mentioned events have been handed over to a small committee chaired by the Minister of Commerce, Graham. The Arbitration Committee discussed the peaceful resolution of internal disputes within the Empire today, and progress has been made. The reservation has been submitted for consideration. The issue of disarmament will be discussed again tomorrow. The Forestry Committee also discussed the training of forestry personnel today. The newly established Singapore Naval Base Committee held its first meeting tonight.</p>

Airplanes sent by the Aviation Administration flew along the route to show respect.</p>
<p>▲ Street Arrangements: From Tán's residence to the First Park, memorial arches were erected on the main streets and lanes by the Central Party Headquarters, government ministries, and departments, totaling more than thirty. The staff of each agency held a roadside memorial service under the arch built by their agency as the casket passed by.</p>
<p>▲ Arrangement of the Memorial Hall: Inside the First Park, from the gate to the memorial hall along a winding path, black and white cloth were used to make curtains and awnings. The memorial hall and the protective hall were hung with elegiac couplets and memorial banners, and filled with wreaths. In front of the hall was a three-zhang-tall pine and cypress archway with hundreds of green and white electric lights embedded in it. A portrait of President Tán was hung above the hall, with incense and flowers offered on both sides. The casket was covered with a plain curtain on the outside. The couplet from the National Government read, "With profound reputation and influence, meritorious service to the Party and the nation, fame will be forever remembered, may your spirit protect our country," The couplet from Commander-in-Chief Jiǎng read, "The country depends on concerted efforts, supporting it through difficulties. With the loss of your great selflessness, to revitalize the era your strategies were profound, carefully planned, and all are disappointed and saddened." The couplet from the Belgian Plenipotentiary Minister Waholos read, "Riding the wind, your spirit fills the land, remembering when you shared drinks in the upper country, riding to the immortal mountain, your sorrow fills the seas, we regret the loss of a phoenix," In addition, the couplets from important figures at home and abroad were too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>▲ Halting Etiquette: The soldiers and police escorting the casket and the staff of various agencies stopped in two rows facing each other when the leading troops reached the gate of the First Park.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Will Reside in Beiping</h3>
<p>▲ Reorganization of Political System in the Three Eastern Provinces Also Imminent</p>
<p>(Shenyang Dispatch) Urged by the Central Government, Zhang Xueliang assumed the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force on the 9th. Henceforth, the Northeast will further demonstrate its support for the Central Government. The Central Government appointed Zhang to the position to reward him for his contributions to the Party and the nation and to task him with managing the aftermath in the North. Upon assuming office, Zhang decided in a recent cadre meeting that he would depart for Beiping within days to take up residence. The location for his Deputy Commander-in-Chief's headquarters has also been designated in Beiping. Special commissioners have been dispatched to prepare the official residence. It is also planned to invite Commander-in-Chief Chiang to meet in Beiping to discuss all matters. Zhang's departure for Beiping is scheduled to take place within ten days. The Third Army, commanded by Hu Yukun, is being organized to accompany him into the pass, or at least a portion of the army. After Zhang Xueliang leaves Shenyang, the duties of the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Border Defense will be temporarily assumed by Zhang Zuoxiang. Concurrently, Wan Fulin, Chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Tang Yulin, Chairman of Rehe Province, and Zhang Jinghui, Chief Executive of the Harbin Special District, will also leave Shenyang to return to their original posts. Thus, the Northeast's alignment with the Central Government can be said to have reached a certain stage under the goal of supporting the central government. Zhang Qun, the Special Mayor of Shanghai, who previously bore a significant mission, departed for Dalian on the 11th, considering his mission to be fulfilled, and will return to Nanjing by sea to report on his duties. Wu Tiecheng, also scheduled to go west on the 12th to handle party affairs in Beiping. All liaison matters between the Central Government and the Northeast will be handled by Fang Benren.</p>
<p>Another report indicates that the allegiance of the Northeast to the Central Government was pledged at the end of last year. Due to various reasons, the establishment of positions such as the Northeast Political Affairs Committee, the Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Border Defense, and the Deputy Commander in Jilin were temporary measures, seemingly inconsistent with the organization and systems stipulated by the National Government. It is heard that Zhang Xueliang, before assuming the position of Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, discussed these matters several times with Zhang Zuoxiang, Wan Fulin, and Tang Yulin. Since the Northeast and the National Government are now moving towards unity, it is proposed to abolish the Political Affairs Committee and implement separate military and civil governance in each province, with complete obedience to the Central Government. Upon the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force assuming office, the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast Border Defense will be offered to Zhang Zuoxiang, but Zhang Zuoxiang has repeatedly declined the offer. If this materializes, Zhang's position as Deputy Commander in Jilin will be given to Zhang Jinghui, the Chief Executive of the Harbin Special District, and Xi Qia will be promoted to Chief Executive of the Special District. Regarding the issue of separate military and civil governance, a certain important figure has recommended Cheng Yun as the Chairman of Jilin Province and Rong Hou as the Chairman of Heilongjiang Province. Tang Yulin, the Chairman of Rehe, will be appointed as the Commander of the Garrison in Rehe and Suiyuan. An announcement is expected soon, as the First and Second Armies of the Northeast have already entered the Pingjin area and are advancing along the Pinghan and Pingsui lines. In the future, Suiyuan will also fall under the Northeast's sphere of influence. Whether the above points have been fully discussed and agreed upon or whether there will be other changes in the future remains to be seen. This is recorded for observation. (11th)</p>
<h3>Recent Important News in Diplomatic Circles</h3>
<p>▲ Sino-British Negotiations: During his visit to Nanjing, the British Minister Sir Miles Lampson resolved several important pending issues between China and Britain. The British Concession in Xiamen has been returned, Weihaiwei has been handed over to China, and the Boxer Indemnity refund agreement has been signed. These are all important developments in Sino-British relations.</p>
<p>The British Concession in Xiamen did not have clear regulations. Its origin lies in Article 2 of the Sino-British Treaty of Daoguang 22 (July), which stipulated that British people were permitted to reside, trade, and conduct business in Xiamen with their families. Article 7 of the Sino-British Supplementary Treaty of Commerce of Daoguang 23 (August) stipulated that British people were permitted to lease houses and land in Xiamen, with the British Consul notifying the local authorities for registration. In Daoguang 24 (August), the local officials of Xiamen and the British reached an agreement to designate the South Training Ground and the Naval Drill Ground in Xiamen as the British Concession. This was the origin of the British Concession in Xiamen. These two areas were quite far from the Xiamen docks, which was inconvenient for British businesses, so an additional section was leased. The total area was approximately 90 zhang in length. Its nature can only be described as leased land and not a concession. The organization of the Xiamen Concession Municipal Council began in Guangxu 3 (1877). Its scale was extremely small and could not be compared to those in Hankou, Jiujiang, and Zhenjiang. After the May Thirtieth Movement in the Republic of China 14 (1925), the British Consulate in Xiamen, in order to protect British residents, accepted the Chinese side's proposal to abolish the Municipal Council police. All administrative rights within the concession were completely handed over to the Chinese police. Thereafter, the so-called British Concession existed only in name. Therefore, the procedure for the current return was simple. Once the deed was completed, it could be said that the return was realized.</p>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity exchange of notes was signed on September 22. It stipulated that the British government, after the necessary legislation was passed by the Parliament, would return the full amount of the Boxer Indemnity due from December 1, 1922, to the Chinese government for management. The Chinese government would use the majority of the returned funds to establish a foundation for the reorganization and construction of railways and invest in other Chinese productive enterprises as loans, subject to interest payments. It also stipulated the organization of a purchasing committee to buy materials in England for Chinese railway construction. In addition, it was determined that 265,000 pounds would be allocated to the University of Hong Kong for the education of Chinese students, and 200,000 pounds would be allocated to the London China Universities Committee for inviting famous Chinese figures to lecture in England and promote cultural exchange between China and Britain. The content of the exchange of notes is roughly as described above. The original text will be published soon. The handover of Weihaiwei has been completed, so further details are not repeated here.</p>
<p>▲ Sino-Russian Negotiations: The formal Sino-Russian conference officially commenced on the 11th of this month. The scope of this conference is broader than previous discussions. In addition to the issue of the Chinese Eastern Railway, issues such as transportation and commerce are also on the agenda. The Chinese side advocates discussing the Chinese Eastern Railway issue first. After a resolution is reached, other issues will be discussed. The Central Government will dispatch four additional experts to Moscow to assist in the proceedings.</p>
<p>▲ Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Conference: The Sino-Japanese Telecommunications Conference has only convened twice since its opening on September 17. The third meeting was originally scheduled for October 1, but it was postponed because the Japanese side wanted to consider the Chinese proposals in detail. However, it is expected to convene soon and continue the discussions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also notified the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires that the Qingdao-Sasebo submarine cable agreement will expire at the end of this year and that China will take back and manage it independently. The Ministry has requested that the Japanese Ministry of Communications be notified to hand it over by the deadline. Furthermore, the Ministry has also notified the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires to notify the Datong and Dabeij submarine cable companies that their contracts will be cancelled at the end of this year and that foreigners will never be allowed to enjoy submarine cable landing rights in China.</p>
<p>▲ Treaty Negotiations: Several countries are currently involved in treaty negotiations. These are described separately below: (A) Sino-Siamese: There are a large number of overseas Chinese and Chinese merchants in Siam. Due to the lack of treaty relations between China and Siam, it is impossible to protect the overseas Chinese in Siam, causing considerable hardship to the diaspora. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has repeatedly proposed treaty negotiations to the Siamese government, but without satisfactory results. Recently, during a meeting of the League of Nations, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs took advantage of the opportunity to instruct the Chinese Minister Wu to propose Sino-Siamese treaty negotiations to the Siamese representative. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from Minister Wu stating that the Siamese representative has agreed to propose the negotiation of a Sino-Siamese treaty to his government upon his return to Siam. (B) Sino-Panamanian: The Sino-Panamanian commercial treaty is being negotiated by the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Panama, Li Shizhong, and the Panamanian government. Once a draft treaty is agreed upon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will request the National Government to issue full powers for signing. (C) Sino-Czechoslovakian: The Sino-Czechoslovakian Treaty of Amity and Commerce was signed in Nanjing on February 13 of this year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a letter from the Czech representative stating that the Sino-Czechoslovakian commercial treaty was formally ratified by the Czech President on September 27. The ratification documents will be personally delivered by the newly appointed Chargé d'Affaires, Dr. Rafael. The Ministry has replied, expressing the hope that Representative Rafael will come to China as soon as possible to exchange ratification documents with the Ministry so that the treaty can take effect as soon as possible. (D) Sino-Peruvian: The Sino-Peruvian treaty is being negotiated by the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Peru, Wei Zijing, and the Peruvian government. However, there is still no agreement on the treatment of overseas Chinese in Peru, which has delayed the formation of a draft treaty. Due to the recent coup in Peru, there will be a temporary halt. However, consultations will resume with the new government soon.</p>
<p>▲ Establishment of Consulates: The establishment of consulates can also be described in several points: (A) Annam: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received telegrams from various groups in Annam urging the establishment of a consulate. The Sino-French Vietnam commercial treaty has not yet been ratified by the governments of both countries. Once the ratification documents are exchanged, consuls will be appointed to Annam. (B) Dili: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that there is a need to establish a consulate in Portuguese Dili due to the large number of overseas Chinese there. It has recently telegraphed the Chinese Minister to Portugal, Wang Tingzhang, instructing him to seek the Portuguese government's consent. (C) Poland: After the signing of the Sino-Polish commercial treaty and protocol, there are no major issues between the two countries. China has long since ratified the commercial treaty, but the protocol has not yet been ratified, so it has not yet been implemented. The Polish parliament has now been dissolved. The Polish government has recognized the treaty, so the protocol can be implemented once it is ratified by the Chinese Legislative Yuan. It is also planned to exchange ambassadors and consuls.</p>
<p>▲ Protection of Overseas Chinese: Regarding the increase in entry tax by the Dutch East Indies, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly protested. According to a report from the Chinese embassy in the Netherlands, the Council of the Dutch East Indies, in order to supplement the budget, will increase the entry tax from 100 guilders to 150 guilders, effective January 1 of next year. This matter has been submitted by the Council to the Dutch government for review. The Dutch Colonial Office has now sent it back to the Council for further discussion. A final decision has not been made. A protest has been lodged with the Dutch government, requesting that it earnestly cancel this proposal in order to preserve the friendship between the two countries. In addition, the Dutch East Indies government also proposes to increase the stamp tax on residence permits. This matter has also been protested to the Dutch government. Recently, the Dutch East Indies has also imposed various restrictions and guarantees on incoming overseas Chinese. If these are implemented, travelers to the Dutch East Indies will inevitably waste time and money. This is not the way to treat people from friendly nations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in the Netherlands to lodge a serious protest with the Dutch government.</p>
<h3>Jiang Guangnai and Cai Tingkai Arrive in Hankou</h3>
<p>(Hankou Express Dispatch) Jiang Guangnai, Commander-in-Chief of the Nineteenth Route Army and Commander of the Sixtieth Division, and Cai Tingkai, Commander of the Eighteenth Army and Commander of the Sixty-first Division, arrived in Hankou at 11:00 AM on the 16th aboard a special train on the Pinghan Railway. A reporter rushed to interview them and had a brief conversation, the main points of which are as follows: (Reporter) Commander-in-Chief Jiang and Commander Cai, how many people accompanied you on this trip from Xuchang to Hankou? (Jiang) We departed from Xuchang the day before yesterday and arrived in Hankou today. The only companion is Comrade Lin Yizhong, the representative of the comfort delegation dispatched by Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang of the Eighth Route Army, besides a few guards. (Reporter) According to Chief He of the General Headquarters, your troops have been transferred to Hankou to assist in suppressing the Communist bandits in Hubei. Where are your troops currently concentrated, and when will they depart for Hubei? (Jiang) After receiving the order to transfer to Hubei, our division concentrated in Xuchang and prepared to begin transportation on the 18th. However, there is a shortage of vehicles on the Pinghan Railway, so it will be difficult to arrive completely at once. (Reporter) Commander-in-Chief and Commander Cai, you have participated in the campaign against the rebels, traversed thousands of miles, and contributed greatly. We would like to hear about your past achievements. (Jiang) It is the duty of revolutionary soldiers to suppress rebellion and defend the Party and the nation. There is no merit to speak of. However, after our troops eliminated Zhang Guitang in Hunan, we joined the battles on the Longhai and Jinpu lines. The fighting was fierce beyond compare. Fortunately, thanks to the virtue of the Commander-in-Chief and the efforts of all the officers and soldiers, we recovered Jinan, causing the rebel forces of Yan and Feng to collapse. Subsequently, our troops were ordered to participate in the battles on the Pinghan Line. At that time, Feng's rebel troops, with six divisions of Liang Guanying, Zhang Weixi, Tian Jinkai, Liu Ruming, and others, stubbornly resisted between Xuchang and Zhengzhou. Our troops' line was northwest of Xuchang. After our troops fought hard and surrounded them, the rebel troops fled to the northwest of Xuchang, where they were intercepted by our troops. In that battle, more than 50,000 to 60,000 people were disarmed. Later, the rebel troops fled to the southeast of Xuchang and were intercepted by Gu Zhutong's Eighth Column and Jiang Dingwen's Ninth Column, and many were disarmed. By this point, Feng's main force had been almost completely lost. (Reporter) When will the fighting on the front lines be completely over? Where will the pursuit of Feng's fleeing troops continue? (Jiang) The military campaign against the rebels should be over soon. The pursuit of the remnants of Feng's rebels is planned to continue to Shaanxi and Gansu to save the people of the Northwest. (Reporter) What is the recent situation of the Gui troops? (Jiang) The Gui rebel troops have suffered repeated heavy blows and only have a small area left. Their firearms are no more than a few thousand, so there is definitely no problem. (Reporter) Commander-in-Chief and Commander Cai, will you stay in Hankou for a long time or will you go elsewhere? (Jiang) We plan to stay in Hankou for two or three days and then fly to Nanjing. Whether we return to Guangdong or return to Hankou after that will be decided after meeting with the Commander-in-Chief. Where the headquarters and division headquarters will be located in the future must also be requested from the Commander-in-Chief. At this point, the reporter took his leave. (October 16)</p>
<h3>Jiaozhou Naval and Army Forces Engage Bandits</h3>
<p>▲ Wang Ziming's Band Completely Eliminated</p>
<p>▲ Over 200 Killed, Over 100 Captured</p>
<p>(Qingdao Dispatch) Zhan Shutang, the commander of the 73rd division, was ordered to suppress bandits in Jiaozhou. After arriving, Commander Zhan along with the county magistrate of Jiaoxian, Xie Caizhang led the troops south and moved their headquarters to Wangtai town. At the same time, the Qingdao based Navy also sent the Jiangli warship carrying Marines to Haixi to assist in the battle and prevent the bandits from fleeing east. The order to attack was given on the 11th, surrounding about 1,000 bandits led by Wang Ziming in Shuicheng and Xuejialing, located about 35 li south of Wangtai. A fierce battle ensued, resulting in over 200 bandits killed on the spot, including a bandit deputy commander and five regimental commanders. Over 100 bandits were captured, and four mortars and dozens of Mauser pistols were seized. The remaining hundreds of bandits broke through the encirclement and fled to Xiaomawan in the eastern countryside, where they ransacked supplies. The county government urgently dispatched the militia of the Hanxin District to intercept them. At that time, Zhang Maode, the commander of the 218th Brigade, had already led his troops to pursue. On the evening of the 12th, the bandits fled again to Yangjiatun, only 20 li away from the county seat. Commander Zhan, upon receiving the report, dispatched a large force on the 13th to encircle and suppress them. At the same time, the militias from the western countryside of Jimo and the southern countryside of Pingdu also rushed to assist. Attacked from both sides, the bandit forces could not withstand the pressure and scattered and fled. The bandit gang of Wang Ziming was completely eliminated at this point. The remaining bandits are still being eliminated by the county government, which has mobilized the militias from various townships to join the suppression effort. Commander Zhan and County Magistrate Xie triumphantly returned to the city on the 12th. On the 13th, over 30 captured bandits were executed as a warning. The people of the entire county held a celebration rally on the morning of the 14th to welcome the returning soldiers. Commander Zhan and County Magistrate Xie both gave speeches. Now that the major threat has been eliminated, Commander Zhan does not need to stay in Jiaoxian for long. He led his troops back to Weixian on the 15th to resume defensive duties. The Marines also returned to Qingdao yesterday to report the bandit suppression operations to the Naval Headquarters. (October 15)</p>
<h3>Symington's Letter to Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>▲ Intent on Preserving His Position</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Xueliang Refuses Sternly</p>
<p>The Kuomintang News Agency reports that Symington, who previously forcibly occupied the Tianjin Customs and resisted the Central Government, sent a letter to Zhang Xueliang in Shenyang, thinking to use 2 million yuan in Tianjin Customs revenue as the price to secure his position. He was sternly refused by Zhang. The full text of Symington's plea for assistance is recorded below: "To General Zhang, I hereby submit this letter to inform you of the details of the Tianjin Customs, including all immediately available tax revenue and the amounts that can be remitted each month. Only Your Excellency can find a way to maintain the position of Symington and his current colleagues. If you are willing to appoint Symington as the Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs, the tens of thousands of yuan in surplus tax revenue can be remitted immediately. In my humble opinion, Your Excellency should follow the old example of the Shanxi authorities and grant Symington the titles of Commissioner of the Tianjin Customs and Advisor. Then, I can directly sign checks and present them to Your Excellency. In addition to the accumulated cash revenue, there are still 640,000 taels of Haikwan silver deposited in the Bank of Communications, which was previously handed over. The Shanxi authorities have repeatedly demanded the withdrawal of this amount, but I have refused. Furthermore, there are 350,000 yuan in Boxer Indemnity from Russia for the month of September. Taiyuan has also telegraphed, urging the remittance of this amount within a week, but I have not complied. Furthermore, according to the national cigarette tax rate in China, it is originally 33%. Recently, the Shanxi authorities raised the cigarette tax in Hebei to 50%. As a result, the British-American Tobacco factory in Tianjin was forced to shut down. If Your Excellency can restore the original tax rate, then I can have the British-American Tobacco company immediately pay 500,000 to 600,000 yuan in stamp tax. In summary, raising over 2 million yuan in cash is within my capabilities. In addition, the monthly tax revenue is also over 1 million yuan. Apart from the financial support, if Your Excellency appoints me as the Tianjin Customs Commissioner, then I will be a man of Your Excellency and can also increase Your Excellency's influence considerably. Tianjin Customs is the second largest customs in China, with as many as 458 employees. The annual revenue is over 26 million yuan. Since I took over, I have recruited talent from all over the country and implemented major reforms, making it a true Chinese customs. This can also be called a major progress in your country. All the old malpractices have been eliminated without a trace, and the entire customs has been transformed. This is a well-known fact. Now, the old staff of Tianjin Customs are thinking of returning to their old positions, wanting to destroy the work I have painstakingly managed, and have announced that they will expel me tomorrow (Monday). I have decided to resist them with all my might. Recently, a friend came from outside the customs and told me everything, so I wrote this hastily. I have always been loyal to the late General Zhang Zuolin for a long time. After his death, I worked hard to expose the truth of his assassination to the world. Now that I am in a critical situation, I dare to beg for Your Excellency's assistance. The Nanjing authorities have repeatedly threatened me. If their threats materialize, then my reputation will be ruined from now on. If I am accepted, then I will do my best to repay Your Excellency and the entire Liaoning province. I beg for a secret instruction. If I am favored with an appointment, then the world will know that I have the most important figures in China as my backing, and my position can be secured from then on. I originally intended to explain everything in person, but the situation in the customs is serious, and I dare not overstep my bounds. I humbly submit this letter with a detailed account, wishing you good health, Symington, September 21st."</p>

<p>Cotton Merchants Robbed on Boats: In the southern townships of the county, more cotton is planted than rice. Now is the time when cotton is on the market, and merchants from various places are carrying large sums of money to the countryside to buy cotton, hoping to make a small profit. On the 15th, a shuttle boat to Pinghu and Shanyang was sailing from Pinghu back to Shanyang when five bandits with Mauser pistols suddenly forced it to stop near Jin Siliang Bridge, boarded the boat, and robbed everyone. None of the passengers were spared. Zhou Jiankang from Jinshanwei was robbed of 1,800 silver dollars, and Chen Kaitai and Lu Hongtai's cotton firm also had over 3,000 yuan in Zhuang banknotes, all of which were looted, resulting in a loss of about 5,000 yuan.

We have telegraphed General Commander Chiang to investigate and handle the matter. The Transport Commissioner should notify the merchants and people to be aware that they must not privately buy or sell salt and be accomplices in prohibited activities, which will result in punishment.

<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Youxing Steamer Almost Robbed Again: The Youxing steamer, founded by the Gaoyou Construction Bureau, has been robbed by bandits three times since it began operating. At 8:00 AM yesterday, it departed from Gaoyou for Xinghua. At around 10:00 AM, when it arrived near Xinzhuang, two farmers on the shore suddenly appeared, looking flustered, and came from the east. Seeing the steamer sailing east, they warned the steamer not to proceed, saying that there were several bandit boats about a mile away, with more than a hundred bandits. The driver thought it was nonsense and continued to sail. At one point, the passengers shouted in alarm and asked to turn back. Unexpectedly, the steamer had been spotted by the bandits. As the steamer turned around, the bandits suddenly fired a shot. Fortunately, the steamer was moving very fast and was not hit. The shell landed in the water about two feet away from the stern, with a loud bang, splashing water everywhere. Seeing that the shell had missed, the bandits abandoned the boat and went ashore, firing their guns and chasing after them. The steamer then opened full throttle and sailed into the harbor, avoiding the disaster. It is now said that the Construction Bureau is considering permanently suspending the service due to the frequent robberies.</p>
<p>Robbery of Rice Boat Kills Entire Family: In the northern countryside of San Duo Town, in this county, two brothers surnamed Wu, the younger brother bought more than ninety shi of rice and grains in San Duo the day before yesterday and transported them to Taizhou for sale.

When he arrived at the Taizhou grain shop, he saw his younger brother's boat parked at the dock, but the rice had not been unloaded. No one was seen on the younger brother's boat, only several tall and strong men, all of whom were unfamiliar. He suddenly became suspicious and secretly questioned the shop owner, who was also surprised to learn of the change and reported it to the Public Security Bureau. The bureau sent police to arrest eight people and sent them to the county government. The older brother also surrendered himself to the authorities. The judge opened the court for trial, and the bandits had no way to deny it because the Wu brother confronted them in court. They then confessed that they had tied up the entire family of five on the boat and thrown them into the river in an area more than twenty li away from San Duo in this county. They then transported the boat's rice and grains to the Rice and Grain Store in Taizhou for sale, and so on. After the interrogation, they were ordered to be chained and imprisoned. Wu immediately returned to his village and sent people to the river to retrieve the five bodies and transport them back for burial.</p>
<p>Education News Highlights</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Petitions for Interpretation of the Civil Service Appointment Regulations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan regarding whether the fourth paragraph of the fourth article of the Civil Service Appointment Regulations should be interpreted or amended, requesting that it be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review. The petition stated that the second paragraph of articles five, six, and seven of the Regulations on the Screening and Review of Incumbent Civil Servants, promulgated by the National Government on October 30, 1929, and the fifth paragraph of article three of the Civil Service Appointment Regulations, promulgated by the National Government on October 29, 1929, stipulated that civil service graduates must come from schools approved by the Ministry of Education. However, the fourth paragraph of the fourth article of the Civil Service Appointment Regulations only stipulates "graduates from domestic or foreign universities or higher vocational schools" and does not add the words "approved by the Ministry of Education" to indicate restrictions. In addition to public and registered private schools, there are many unregistered private schools in the country. Graduates of unregistered private schools should not receive the same treatment as graduates of public and registered private schools. This was clearly stipulated in the regulations for private schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education. As for the level of foreign schools, they are also varied and must be reviewed separately. Only those who are deemed qualified can receive the same treatment as graduates of public and registered private schools. According to the fourth paragraph of the fourth article of the Civil Service Appointment Regulations, all graduates of unapproved and unregistered domestic and foreign schools have the qualifications for appointment, which could lead to many malpractices and be difficult to review. The regulations of the Ministry of Education for reorganizing domestic private schools and reviewing foreign private schools will also lose their effectiveness. Although the rank of appointed officials is lower, the positions they hold are also very important, and their academic qualifications should be subject to the same restrictions as those of recommended officials in order to ensure uniformity and fairness. The Ministry of Education did not presume to propose whether the relevant provisions should be interpreted or amended, as they concern the law. It prepared this document and submitted it for review and requested that it be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review and compliance.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Funding Must Not Be Diverted from Grain Transport Tax</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education has stated that the grain transport tax (忙漕正稅) allocated to them is specifically for educational purposes and cannot be diverted for local education expenses. They have submitted a request to the provincial government to convene a meeting to decide on how to maintain funding until alternative sources can be found. The Department of Education's report states that they received a communication from the Department of Finance regarding the provincial government's instruction to the Department of Education in response to requests from Jiangning, Changshu, and other counties’ Education Bureaus to be exempted from remitting 50% of overdue fines collected within the county. It was ordered that the request be approved and communicated to the relevant authorities for compliance. A previous instruction from the provincial government and a communication from your department to the Department of Education regarding this matter were duly acknowledged. Now, in light of the aforementioned reasons, a copy of the instruction is presented, and a formal request is made for your examination and compliance. We have examined the original report, which mentions that the grain transport tax has been allocated to education funding in recent years, referring to the special education funds from land tax. However, according to the decision of the Central Political Council when the land tax was allocated to local revenue, 1.8 million was annually allocated for educational expenses to compensate for the original tobacco special tax. For the past three years, actual revenue has fallen significantly short, and a request has been submitted to your office for assistance. Furthermore, this special fund is for provincial education expenses and is separate from local education expenses. At a time when provincial education funds are severely strained, there is no additional capacity to compensate for the shortfall in local education revenue in various counties. The comprehensive allocation plan proposed in the original report may be difficult to implement. Regarding the request from the Education Bureaus of various counties to temporarily maintain the previous practice of retaining a percentage of overdue fines collected within the county for local education use, the Department has carefully examined the situation. This request is made out of genuine necessity. For over a decade, 50% of overdue fines collected within the county have been allocated to education and included in the education budget. Suddenly transferring these funds to the province would fundamentally shake the local education budget, inevitably causing some educational programs to be suspended. Moreover, the current fiscal year has already begun, and the Department has approved most of the education budgets for various counties. A sudden change would be extremely difficult. The provincial treasury is depleted, as stated in the original report, and should be considered. However, the matter concerns the rise and fall of local education, which falls under the Department's responsibility, and we cannot stand idly by. Until alternative sources of funding can be found, we respectfully request your office to review and issue instructions on how to maintain funding to prevent disruptions to the education budgets of various counties and avoid the suspension of educational programs. This is for the public good. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<h3>Xu Beihong Wins Special Prize at the Brussels International Exposition</h3>
<p>To commemorate the centennial of Belgian independence, a world exposition was held in Brussels. Many Chinese exhibits won prizes. Yesterday, Mr. Xie, the acting chargé d'affaires in Belgium, telegraphed Mr. Xu Beihong that Xu's work at the exposition had won the special prize for art. Details will follow.</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Central University's Administrative Reform Movement</h3>
<p>▲Heads of General Affairs and Accounting Suspended for Investigation</p>
<p>After the students of Central University (中大) issued a declaration to improve school administration, all the inside stories of the school have been thoroughly understood by all parties. The school's administrative authorities acknowledge the students' intentions were legitimate. However, they believe that the declaration should not have been released because this gives those opposing the school the chance to take advantage and cause the school to fundamentally waver, thereby losing the original purpose of promoting administrative reform. The school is currently planning on how to remedy the situation. Yesterday, Zhang Heng, the secretary-general of the school who had already resigned, published a clarification in the Central University school journal, stating that the five points, including "monopolizing administrative and economic power in the school" and "engaging in embezzlement and corruption," are not within the scope of the secretary-general's duties and do not conform to the facts. Shao Cong, the head of general affairs, and Dai Chongen, the head of accounting, both sent letters to the president of the school requesting that they be immediately suspended for investigation to clarify the truth.</p>

<h3>Central Government Inspection Deems Current Situation of Local Boy Scouts Satisfactory</h3>
<p>Recently, the headquarters of the Chinese Boy Scouts dispatched Mr. Luo Qiu to Shanghai to supervise the election of directors for the Shanghai Boy Scouts Council and to inspect the current situation of the Shanghai Boy Scouts. Mr. Luo inspected twelve troops, including the 15th, 23rd, and 50th, for three days starting on the 7th. He conducted detailed examinations of the internal organization and curriculum training of each troop. He also took the opportunity to inspect all the city's Boy Scouts during the National Day parade for a week, paying close attention to the uniforms, badges, and the spirit and discipline of the troop members. It is reported that the results of this inspection were deemed satisfactory by Mr. Luo. However, Mr. Luo could not stay in Shanghai for long due to pressing work at headquarters and returned to Beijing early on the 11th. It is also said that this inspection was temporary in nature, and the short amount of time meant that a widespread inspection could not be conducted.</p>
<h3>Boy Scouts Council Meeting Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Council of the Chinese Boy Scouts, convened by the City Training Department in its previous meeting, is scheduled to meet today at 1:00 PM at the Ximen City Party Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Dispatches Personnel to Inspect Labor University Today</h3>
<p>▲School Affairs Proceed as Usual</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has dispatched Zhu Baoqin and Xie Shuying as inspectors to Labor University. Their nature is no different from that of school inspectors. Zhu and Xie have already contacted the school and are scheduled to visit various departments and agencies for inspection starting today. As for the selection of the university president, it is rumored that the Ministry of Education has already made an internal decision and will announce it soon. Currently, the school's affairs are being maintained as usual by the interim administrative committee formed by the school affairs conference. Furthermore, the Ministry of Education appointed Zhuang Quan as the dean of the School of Engineering at the university. The university believes that the dean should be appointed by the university president, as stipulated by the University Organization Law. The school is currently exercising the powers of the university president through the school affairs conference, and the appointment of the dean should be the responsibility of the school affairs conference. The Ministry of Education should not overstep its boundaries. Therefore, a letter was sent to Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, and Cai Yuanpei, the founders of the school, requesting them to convey this intention to the Ministry of Education. Yesterday, the school welcomed Fan Diwen to give a lecture. All the faculty and students attended, totaling over a thousand people, creating an extraordinarily lively atmosphere.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Second Day of the Fudan University 25th Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>▲Awarding of Honorary Degrees</p>
<p>▲Speeches by Yu Youren and Others</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 17th) was the day of the 25th anniversary celebration of Fudan University in Shanghai. From 8:00 AM, guests from all walks of life arrived in an endless stream, creating an unprecedentedly grand occasion for the university. A brief record of the events is as follows:</p>

He hoped that everyone would continue to work hard to make Fudan University as famous as Yale University in the United States. Founder Ma Xiangbo explained in detail the meaning of the name "Fudan University" and elaborated on the meaning of the two characters, "Fu" and "Dan," with both humor and depth.

<h3>The Re-established School of Law at Jinan University</h3>
<p>(1) History Since the reorganization and expansion of National Jinan University in the summer of 1927, there have been regulations regarding the establishment of a School of Social Sciences. In the summer of 1928, the organization was revised and changed to the School of Law, and the Department of Political Science and Law was expanded into the Department of Political Science, Law, and Economics. In 1929, the organization was changed again, and each school implemented the establishment of a dean and adopted a separate school administrative system. The School of Law did not have a dean, the Department of Law was made independent, and the Department of Political Science and Economics was merged into the School of Literature. The School of Law was then abolished. Now, this autumn, a Department of Diplomacy and Consular Affairs has been added. Furthermore, because the Department of Political Science and Economics has been divided into two groups, it is no different from having two departments. The number of students has greatly increased, and the School of Law has become substantial. Therefore, the school affairs conference has decided to re-establish it.</p>
<p>(2) Organization The school is now divided into two departments, two groups, and one specialty. Mr. Wang Renlin, a political scientist, has been hired as the dean. Mr. Wang has studied in Europe and the United States for many years and has served in important social positions, giving him rich experience. The curriculum of each department in the school is very rich, and the newly added courses are particularly unique. In addition to the existing faculty, more than 20 new faculty members have been hired. Sun Hanbing is the head of the Department of Political Science and Economics, Shi Jiong is the head of the Department of Law, and Yang Zhenxian is the head of the Department of Diplomacy and Consular Affairs. All of them are the best of their time.</p>
<p>(3) Current Faculty Sun Hanbing, Zhang Yunfu, Zheng Juemin, Ma Chonggan, Zhu Longhui, Sheng Zhenwei, Zhang Zhirang, Shi Jiong, Yang Zhenxian, Cai Jinghuai, Tao Xisheng, Zhu Tongjiu, Yu Nanqiu, Chen Anren, Yuan Jian, Yuan Yibo, Li Mo, Wang Hanzhang, Wen Chongxin, Huang Zhongjian, Li Bingyu, Li Binghuan, Qiu Hanping, Fu Wenkai, Yu Chengxiu, Wei Weiqing, and Mei Jiejie. In addition, there are several specially appointed lecturers, such as Tan Shaohua, a member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who teaches on the Organization of Diplomatic Agencies; Dai Ailu, the chief writer of the Bank Weekly, who teaches on Financial Problems and Public Finance; Qian Chengxu, a director of the Science Society of China, who teaches on Chinese Industrial Plans; as well as Dai Xiuzan and Dong Kang, who teach various law courses.</p>
<p>(4) Plans It is reported that Dean Wang advocates that in the future, in addition to focusing on enriching and strictly enforcing the curriculum, improving and creating in academics, he will also pay attention to the training of student discipline, cultivate a true spirit of self-governance, vigorously promote the organization of academic research, and formulate plans for editing various series of books for the school. In the Department of Law, six or seven kinds of books can be published within the year. The school's faculty and staff hold a dinner party once a month to discuss matters related to the school's development and reform.</p>

<h3>Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School Basketball Team on Northern Expedition</h3>
<p>▲Departing Tomorrow Morning at 4:00 AM</p>
<p>The news of the Liangjiang basketball team's trip north for competition has spread widely in sports circles. Last night, the school hosted a banquet for the press at the Weiya Restaurant, and many people attended. During the banquet, team captain Shao Jinying said that the original purpose of organizing the northern expedition team was to improve their basketball skills and promote physical education, and she hoped that everyone would provide guidance. Next, Principal Lu Lihua gave a speech, saying that the team plans to go to Japan to compete in the near future, and negotiations are still in progress. Before going to Japan, they will first travel to Tianjin and Beijing, or even travel to Liaoning along the way, in order to improve their basketball skills through mutual learning. Victory or defeat is not their primary concern. Then, Ge Gongzhen, Gu Zhenglao, Pan Jingmin, Sun Daosheng, Zhang Wugao, Pei Xiyuan, and others gave speeches, generally wishing the team success and hoping that the team would promote the true spirit of women's sports in East China. The banquet ended at 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>The team of eight players, led by Shao Ji, is scheduled to take the Shuntian to Tianjin at 4:00 AM tomorrow. After arriving in Tianjin, they will stay for three days before going to Beijing.

<p>The university's tennis team invited the tennis team of Daxia University to the university for a friendly match. The tennis team of Daxia University is known for its good results, especially the stroke technique of Shen Meizhen in singles. However, since the tennis team of Fudan University was specially refreshed this semester, it has worked hard and made progress compared to last semester. Therefore, neither side was willing to show weakness. The match started at 9:30 AM and lasted until 1:00 PM. The final result was a victory for Fudan University with a score of three to two.</p>
<h3>31st Act of the Champagne Cup Tournament</h3>

<h3>The Remote and Proximate Causes of This Aborted Expedition (II) Yu Hengzhi</h3>
<p>In May of this year, news of our European trip spread to Southeast Asia. Given the exceptional performance of Lehua last year, Java wired us an invitation to visit Java again, one month before our scheduled departure for Europe, for a performance. We felt that revisiting Java would provide us with the opportunity for more practice and collaboration, and also generate revenue to bolster our financial resources. After repeated consideration, we believed it would be beneficial and without harm. Thus, Lehua entrusted me to handle the arrangements, while the responsibility of recruiting talent was placed on Mr. Li's shoulders. Because Mr. Li had connections with players from all sides, and he had organized the trip to Australia, he was experienced and indispensable.</p>
<p>My trip south to make arrangements concluded quickly and satisfactorily. At the same time, Mr. Li, despite being ill, traveled east to Japan. He also successfully negotiated with many players during the journey. Only a few duties remained unfinished. In mid-June, Mr. Li came south first, intending to personally consult with those in Hong Kong who had not yet agreed to participate in the overseas tour. The star players in Hong Kong were divided between the South China Athletic Association and the Chinese Athletic Association. Out of friendship and goodwill, we unnecessarily sent a notice about the overseas tour to gauge their players' willingness to participate. The Chinese Athletic Association's attitude was outwardly indifferent, but inwardly a small number were doing their utmost to sabotage, doing their utmost to prevent their players from participating, even using threats to make players withdraw. As a result, Mr. Sun and Mr. Wu, who had initially agreed to participate, declined at the last minute for no good reason. Mr. Chen and Mr. Cao, who were determined to participate, developed disagreements with the saboteurs due to their differing ambitions. As for the South China Athletic Association, their relationship with Lehua had always been beneficial. When I returned north from Java, I had sincere and earnest discussions with their former chairman, Mr. He, and former football director, Mr. Liu. They also expressed extreme support and promised to do their best to help. However, the South China team was also scheduled for a short trip to British Malaya. Therefore, the three South China players who had agreed to participate in the overseas tour would have to join us in Java only after the South China matches were over. Based on our friendly relationship, we trusted that there would be no other changes. Who would have thought that they would use a diversionary tactic, harboring ulterior motives?</p>
<p>On July 5th, we gathered three players from Hong Kong, Mr. Cao, Mr. Chen, and Mr. Liang, forming a team. We set sail south from Hong Kong. We dared not bring too many players, because three players from South China were expected to join us later, and Mr. Chen Zhenhe would arrive in a week. Furthermore, wouldn't it be a perfect plan to invite three or four more skilled Chinese players from British and Dutch Southeast Asia when we set off for Europe?</p>
<p>Man proposes, God disposes. Due to successive injuries and illnesses, a tight schedule, and the blow of South China reneging on their agreement, we suffered four defeats in Southeast Asia. Our performance was far inferior to last year. However, this touched the sympathy of the overseas Chinese community in Southeast Asia and the genuine assistance of various football clubs, solving the problem of finding talent for the upcoming European tour. Patriotic sentiments overseas are often more sincere and fervent than those at home. This is true in politics, and it is also true in sports. We were deeply grateful for this kind of care during our disappointment.</p>
<p>The demon of failure was discovered. The main reason for the demon's discovery was that our self-confidence was too strong. We confidently believed that this purely amateur sport was merely for enhancing diplomatic relations and fostering goodwill, and would always be beneficial. Various procedures were not considered too important. Furthermore, Mr. Harris had previously said that we did not need to worry if the English Football Association approved, because the Hong Kong and Shanghai football associations were under the authority of the English Football Association. The Association's agreement to welcome and host us would ensure smooth progress. Therefore, we neglected the procedures. Never did we expect that neglecting these procedures would become the root cause of our failure.</p>
<p>While we were preparing in Southeast Asia to depart for Europe as scheduled, the English Football Association, considering that our team was composed of players from Hong Kong, Shanghai, Singapore, and Java, and that the Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Singapore football associations were affiliated members, sent three telegrams to these three locations, asking for their opinions. The Shanghai Association telegraphed that they did not object. Singapore also expressed support. However, the Hong Kong Association, due to its own financial concerns and the encouragement of some saboteurs, telegraphed back that they could not agree. As a result, the English side developed great doubts and telegraphed our team, instructing us to postpone our departure by two weeks.</p>
<p>After a team meeting, we felt that there was not enough time to explain. It would be better to telegraph back to England, stating that our team only consisted of players from Shanghai, Singapore, and Java, and that no players from Hong Kong were participating. The Hong Kong Association's consent was therefore irrelevant. We stated that Hong Kong had no players because Mr. Cao was previously a strong player for San Yu, and Mr. Chen had recently assisted Lehua. Both could be considered Shanghai players. As for Mr. Liang, he could also be considered a member of Lehua, because amateur players can play anywhere at any time. He was in Hong Kong last year, but who knows if he will be in Shanghai next year? After sending the telegram, we thought everything was fine. However, the guarantor on the English side became apprehensive about our strength because no one from Hong Kong was participating, and further telegraphed us, asking us to postpone the tour until February of the following spring for further reorganization. Therefore, we, who were ready to depart, had no choice but to return home.</p>
<p>The above is the reality of the situation. I believe that if Hong Kong had not obstructed us, and had not expressed opposition like the Shanghai and Singapore associations, this European and American tour would have achieved satisfactory results. Because the problem of talent was easily solved. We received mutual support from various Chinese associations in Southeast Asia, who allowed us to borrow as many good players as possible who could take leave. The goalkeeper was Yang Ajiu, a representative of Singapore; the defense included Zhang Xulong from Java, Cai Wenli and Xu Ahui, representatives of Singapore; and the forward line included Ye Songling, a representative of Kuala Lumpur, Chen Meian, a player from Malaya; and Feng Wenxun, a representative of Singapore. Adding our original strength, although we cannot guarantee many victories, we could at least give foreigners a good impression. In my opinion, Hong Kong could have only used three or four players at most. Therefore, in terms of strength, this team could be considered to include seven or eight of the national team players. If we reorganize again in the future, I dare not predict whether we can have such strength again.</p>
<p>The news of the team's return home naturally elicited a lot of sympathy and pity. However, there were also many who gloated. Their intentions and motives are truly incomprehensible. Recently, some have even suspected that the players were being paid. The Hong Kong Association has further suspended the playing rights of Mr. Cao, Mr. Chen, and Mr. Liang. On what basis do they allege that the three gentlemen were being paid? I am also baffled. Because the treatment of our members on this trip was based on the old practice of the Australian tour. The Australian tour did not hinder amateur status, and this time was the same. Although Lehua had very satisfactory economic results, this was all the club's public property, which would be used for developing club affairs in the future and had nothing to do with any player. What the players received was nothing more than the necessary travel expenses.</p>
<p>Indeed, there is a lot of right and wrong in our society. Even in the field of sports, we cannot escape this common rule. I believe that in whatever we do, as long as we can be true to our conscience, we can carry on with a fearless spirit. Success or failure, and the praise or criticism of others, do not need to be fussed over. Moreover, we are prepared for infinite sacrifices in doing this kind of work.</p>
<p>Although the expedition has been aborted, there is still a possibility of continuing the voyage. Although we did not achieve our goal this time, we spent a lot of money and energy. We have at least broken down a difficult barrier on the path of future expeditions for those who come after us. I hope that the National Sports Association of China can rekindle the embers of this failure in the future, and instill the spirit of China's new youth into the minds of those foreigners who often call us sick men. In that case, although we failed this time, there will eventually be someone to succeed, and we can find some comfort. Why do I propose that the Sports Association handle it? Because the Sports Association is the highest sports authority in our country. In the future, when negotiating with the English side, we can avoid the kind of obstacles that required the consent of Hong Kong, Singapore, and Shanghai this time. Moreover, I think that using the name of the Sports Association to recruit talent will definitely have satisfactory results. The continued voyage of the expedition is my sincere wish.</p>
<p>The football season at sea has begun again. Some of Lehua's strong players have transferred to Zhenru due to school-related reasons. Lehua has suffered such a blow, and its strength has naturally decreased significantly. Whether Lehua can form a team at all is a question for many who care about it. There are also those who are overly sensitive and say that there are disagreements within Lehua and that cracks have appeared in the football community. This is all a very unconscious kind of argument. I believe that Lehua must continue to participate no matter what. Because although thinning out the original strength now makes it difficult for both sides to achieve excellent results, it has now created eleven more positions to train new talent. The future achievements will definitely be limitless. Therefore, this method of going our separate ways but ultimately converging is the best.</p>
<p>I have always been extremely opposed to bringing up the past. However, this time I will make an exception. I want to use the remaining space here to say a few words that I really don't want to repeat about the rights and wrongs between the South China Athletic Association and us regarding this matter.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the friendship between South China and Lehua has always been very deep. Every time we pass through Hong Kong, we receive warm hospitality from South China, with the atmosphere of being one family. Who would have thought that this expedition would cause endless rights and wrongs?</p>
<p>When I was making arrangements in Java and returning to Shanghai, I discussed the matter very frankly with the then chairman and football department heads, Mr. He and Mr. Liu, in Hong Kong, treating them as brothers. Mr. He and Mr. Liu were kind enough not to reject us, and fully agreed, expressing their sincerity in cooperating. Even when we departed in early July and passed through Hong Kong, they sincerely expressed their intention to support each other at the South China tea party. Later, when I arrived in Southeast Asia, I personally met with Mr. He and Mr. Yu, the leaders of South China, and asked them when the matches would be over and when the players could join our team. Unexpectedly, at that time, Mr. He and Mr. Yu said that the association had not given instructions and could not comply. Seeing their attitude, I knew that they intended to do so deliberately. More talk would not help. So I had to leave it at that.</p>

<h3>Two Kuomintang Party Branches Telegraph Congratulations to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for Triumphant Return to Nanjing</h3>
<p>▲ And Request Implementation of Five Policies Announced in Steam Telegram</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Special Kuomintang Party Branch of the Nanjing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, upon hearing of Commander-in-Chief Chiang's triumphant return to Nanjing, sent a telegram of congratulations. The original telegram is as follows: Central Executive Committee, with respect. Since Yan and Feng initiated the rebellion, colluding with reactionary forces and betraying the Central Government, causing national turmoil, all depended on our hard-working and meritorious Chairman Chiang, upholding the teachings of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and shouldering the heavy responsibility, enduring hardship and vowing to suppress the rebellion. In just a few months, they were invincible, and their success was immediate, demonstrating that a rabble cannot be called an army, and arrogant people cannot be said to govern. From now on, the remnants of warlords will be completely crushed, and corrupt and traitorous elements will be gradually eliminated. Light will reappear, danger will turn into safety, and peaceful unification is at hand. All our countrymen are singing praises and rejoicing. However, the military suppression of the rebellion has come to an end, but the Communist bandits are still rampant and their roots have not been eradicated. The country is impoverished and the people are sick, and scars are everywhere. We hope that the Executive Committee will adopt the five policies announced in Chairman Chiang's steam telegram, so that villains have no opportunity to take advantage, war will not be seen again, local autonomy will be promoted, domestic and foreign policies will be refreshed, and the country will be governed with diligence and the people will be blessed. The future of the party and the nation depends on this. We send this telegram with respect, wishing you victory and requesting your consideration. We humbly request your understanding. Executive Committee of the Special Kuomintang Party Branch of the Nanjing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Public Memorial Service for President Tan by Chinese and Foreign Communities</h3>
<p>▲ All Kuomintang Party Members in City to Hold Public Memorial Service Today</p>
<p>▲ Representatives from Chinese and Foreign Communities to Proceed to Nanjing</p>
<p>▲ Kuomintang Party Municipal Headquarters to Hold Public Memorial Service Today. The Shanghai Special Municipal Kuomintang Party Headquarters issued the following instruction to all Kuomintang Party branches in the city yesterday: "Regarding the matter of instruction, the Central Executive Committee's Yu telegram states: 'For the information of all Kuomintang Party branches, our Standing Committee member, Mr. Tan Yankai, has been officially ordered by the government to receive a state funeral. The funeral committee has decided to hold a public memorial service for three days, on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of this month. The 18th is the date for the Kuomintang Party's public memorial service. All Kuomintang Party branches in Nanjing and elsewhere should hold memorial services locally on that day to express their condolences. Please comply accordingly and instruct your subordinates to do the same.' Upon receiving this, the Kuomintang Party Headquarters will hold a public memorial service on the third floor of the party headquarters on the 18th. The Kuomintang Party branch is required to send four or more representatives to attend the memorial service at any time from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. on that day to express their condolences. This is an order."</p>
<p>▲ Diplomatic Corps to Proceed to Nanjing Together. The coffin of the late President Tan, of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, was moved to the First Park of the capital a few days ago for a public memorial service. The period from 3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the 20th has been designated for foreign guests to pay their respects. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our Ministry has received a telegram from the Ministry, informing the consulates of various countries in Shanghai to proceed to Nanjing to participate. It is reported that Mr. Shigemitsu, the Japanese Chargé d'Affaires, accompanied by Consul Okazaki, Secretary Wu Guan, Counselor, and others, five in total, will take the train to Nanjing at 11:00 p.m. tonight. The Turkish Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Fotte Bay, and the Polish representative, Mr. Weidengtao, will leave for the capital tomorrow night to attend the public memorial service. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in addition to informing the General Affairs Department of the Ministry, has also contacted the Railway Bureau to prepare cars for everyone.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai Representatives to Go to Nanjing to Offer Condolences. The late President of the Executive Yuan, Tan Yankai, has been ordered to receive a state funeral, which will be held in Nanjing starting on the 18th.

The Municipal Kuomintang Party Headquarters has appointed Mr. Fan Zhengbo and Mr. Wang Yansong, who took the train to Nanjing last night. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appointed Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Ye Huijun, and Mr. Wang Yansong to participate. Mr. Wang and Mr. Ye are scheduled to leave for Nanjing today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Rice Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲ The Second Batch Will Be Shipped Soon</p>
<p>▲ News from the Japanese Side. Guowen News Agency reports that after the first batch of 18,300 stones of Japanese rice arrived in Shanghai, the municipal government decided to ban it, and the situation was not good. The second batch of Japanese rice scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai has now changed its course and stopped shipping to Shanghai to prevent detention. According to Japanese sources yesterday, the second batch of Japanese rice to be shipped to China, about 20,000 stones, was loaded onto Mitsubishi company ships in Osaka yesterday and shipped to Hong Kong, where it will be imported and landed because Hong Kong has not yet been banned. However, the number of loads and the name of the ship are very secret, and it will still need to be transshipped to Shanghai in the future.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Ye Huijun's Opinion. Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau has strictly prohibited the sale of Japanese rice shipped to China. A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency visited Mr. Ye Huijun, a leader in the rice industry, to inquire about his opinion on this matter. According to Mr. Ye, domestic rice production has decreased and prices have fallen this year. But while high grain prices hurt the people, low grain prices hurt the farmers. If large quantities of Japanese rice come to China and drive rice prices lower and lower, agricultural production will inevitably be greatly affected next year, and the result will be no less than that of high grain prices hurting the people. The Japanese rice is coming to China entirely to use China as the final destination for selling old rice. According to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's October 19th draft plan: (1) The Rice Grain Special Accounting will use 70 million yuan to purchase more than 30,000 stones of new grain; (2) The government's 2.25 million stones of old rice will be sold to China and Europe, etc., even at a slight loss; (3) Farmers will be given loans at relatively low interest rates to avoid having to rush to buy things; (4) The rice produced in Taiwan and Korea will be adjusted to prevent Manchurian rice from entering Korea; (5) The effective period of restricting the import of foreign rice will be extended for another year; (6) The import of Siamese rice and North American rice will be prevented. Also, under the third plan to sell the government's 2.25 million stones of old rice, it has been decided to take out 100,000 stones from the Kobe warehouse as samples and hand them over to Mitsui &amp; Co. to be shipped to Shanghai for sale, and another 215 stones will be shipped one after another. It can be seen that the Japanese government, regarding the rice issue, prohibits the import of foreign rice on the one hand, and ships out large quantities of old rice on the other. In order to protect our domestic farmers, we should strictly prohibit Japanese rice from coming to China.</p>
<p>▲ Talk by a Staff Member of the Social Affairs Bureau. Huadong News Agency reports that various circles have been trying to resist the shipping of Japanese rice to China. A reporter from Huadong News Agency visited the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau yesterday and was received by Mr. Sun from the Fourth Section. When asked about the methods of resisting Japanese rice, Mr. Sun said that the Social Affairs Bureau has decided on two methods. One is active, which is to submit a document to the municipal government and forward it to the Central Executive Yuan, requesting that the customs be ordered to increase the import tax rate on Japanese rice so that the price of Japanese rice is higher than that of Chinese rice. Then, even if our people are not prohibited from buying it, they should be deterred. However, the Central Executive Yuan has not yet approved this matter, so active measures have not been implemented. As for the passive aspect, within the scope of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, such as ordering rice merchants to stop buying and rice mills not to mill it. At the same time, the Social Affairs Bureau has sent many staff members to secretly investigate rice mills and rice merchants in the city to see if there are any private purchases or milling. According to the current investigation, after the order was published, it has disappeared. As for the method of investigating and distinguishing Japanese rice, it is very easy. The Japanese rice shipped to China is mostly stored for too long and has turned yellow. Even after whitening, it is far less resistant than Chinese rice. Moreover, Japan does not have rice mills, and what is shipped is pure brown rice, which must be milled by rice mills before it can be sold. Therefore, the investigation will not be difficult. As for the Japanese authorities' repeated statements that the shipping of Japanese rice to China is due to the Japanese economic panic, in order to protect their farmers, they are exporting to China and asking for understanding. However, at this time of abundant harvests in our country, our country cannot accept its request. If their country sells rice due to economic relations to protect the livelihoods of farmers, our country should also give full protection to our farmers. If foreign rice disrupts rice prices, our country's farmers' livelihoods will also be in panic. Mr. Sun also said that rice prices recently, according to yesterday's highest price, the best white rice has fallen to 15.8 yuan, which is not unaffected by the impact of Japanese rice coming to China. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to do its best to maintain it between 15 and 16 yuan and not let it fall. If it falls again, the farmers in the interior will inevitably be greatly affected, and they will not dare to plant rice in the spring plowing next year. Then there will inevitably be a rice shortage next year. The social authorities are responsible for protecting farmers and relieving people's food shortages. Therefore, maintaining rice prices is the best way to protect farmers and relieve people's food shortages.</p>
<h3>Xiao Case Negotiations Expand</h3>
<p>▲ Xiamen All Circles Reject Java Shipping Vessels</p>
<p>Since the incident of the Deputy Chief Officer of the Java Company's Zhibada ship insulting Ms. Xiao of our country occurred, after our newspaper published the details, it has aroused public outrage in all aspects. Recently, the Java Company has still not made any statement on this case. The Java branch here telegraphed the Batavia head office to inquire about how to deal with the case. According to the telegram from the head office, it was determined that Xiao was mentally unclear, and they continued to shirk responsibility and excuses. It was also said that the ship had sent a letter to Ms. Xiao expressing their apologies, saying that the matter had been resolved. When the Seamen's General Union of this port held a plenary meeting on the 15th, the Xiamen seamen's representatives put forward a motion on the Xiao case, requesting the consent of the meeting. It was resolved: (1) to telegraph the International Labor Organization to request its arbitration; (2) to telegraph the central government, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest with the Dutch envoy; (3) the local branch should warn the Java Company to immediately dismiss and severely punish the Deputy Chief Officer who insulted Ms. Xiao, and compensate for the loss of reputation, and guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future. All circles in Xiamen have organized support associations for the Xiao case. Since Java ships have a very large business in Xiamen, the Xiamen Public Association has notified the public to sever business relations with Java ships, including not loading goods and not carrying passengers. At the same time, it also warned the Chinese seamen on Java ships to take the initiative to express themselves in order to promote the resolution of the case. In Xiamen, after the establishment of the Xiao case support association, the ships of the Java Company that arrived in Xiamen were unable to load and unload goods and passengers. Recently, there are as many as eight Java ships in Xiamen that cannot work and operate due to the severing of business relations with the public. They have telegraphed Shanghai for instructions, and the Shanghai office has ordered them to temporarily abandon business in that port and come to Shanghai. All eight ships will be able to arrive in Shanghai within these few days.</p>
<p>The Women's Association also believes that this matter is of great importance to women, so it dispatched members Ms. Chen Zhenquan and Ms. Wu Ruohua as representatives to negotiate with the Overseas Chinese Association, intending to convene representatives of various groups to carry out large-scale support activities in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua and Li Mingzhong Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Explains the Meaning of Suspending Surtaxes</h3>
<p>▲It Restricts Provinces and Cities from Arbitrarily Levying National Taxes</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Cotton Cloth Industry Association yesterday, which stated: "Regarding the previous letter mentioning the continued collection of commodity surtaxes by the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Products Special Tax Bureau, along with an excerpt of a published Ministry document, requesting an inquiry, after telegraphing the Ministry of Finance for instructions, we received a reply from the Ministry of Finance on the 16th of this month. It stated: 'We have received your telegram. The Ministry previously received instructions from the Executive Yuan to order all provincial governments to refrain from levying commodity surtaxes in the future. Any taxes or levies on goods must be approved by the Ministry before implementation. An order to this effect was issued on August [blank] and forwarded to all provincial finance special commissioners, finance bureaus, and municipal finance bureaus. The meaning of this circular is to restrict provincial or municipal governments from arbitrarily levying taxes and levies on goods within the scope of national taxes. Regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Cotton Products Special Tax Bureau’s continued collection of surtaxes as mentioned in your telegram, the Ministry has not received a report detailing the specific circumstances, and has no basis for action. We should await the Jiangsu finance special commissioner’s report after investigation before further action can be taken. You are hereby notified accordingly.' We are enclosing the telegram for your information."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways Investigates Losses</h3>

It is said that the amount of these losses is considerable.</p>
<h3>Lecture Notes of Mr. and Mrs. Vandervelde</h3>
<p>▲Mr. Vandervelde Lectured at Labor University Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Vandervelde, leader of the Second International and Prime Minister of Belgium, visited the National Labor University in Jiangwan yesterday, and at the invitation of the university, delivered a speech in the university's auditorium. The secretary-director of the university, Mr. Peng Xiang, introduced him in Chinese and French, and Mr. Yang Gongda provided interpretation. The lecture lasted for an hour. The main points are recorded as follows: "I am very happy to be able to meet you all today. The secretary-director mentioned that the Chinese Labor University is modeled after the principles of the Belgian Labor University, and that it is the second such university in the world after the Belgian one. This is very accurate. The Belgian Labor University was founded by our Socialist Party. It has two goals: one is to train technical personnel, and the other is to train personnel for social enterprises. These two goals are gradually being achieved. Although the Chinese Labor University is different due to China's circumstances, Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said that China only has the distinction between the very poor and the slightly poor, without capitalists, classes, or workers. However, in reality, there are already capitalists, classes, and workers in China's major cities. These workers lack legal protection and live like cattle and horses. However, I believe that one day they will become aware and organize themselves. Therefore, I hope that in China, under these circumstances, the Labor University, in addition to training specialized technical personnel, should also train technical personnel for social enterprises to realize the demands of the Chinese nation. Although some people in Europe are jealous of you, we in the Socialist Party are looking forward to</p>

<p>your success," and so on.</p>
<p>▲Mrs. Vandervelde Lectured at the Benevolent and Orphanage Society Yesterday</p>
<p>The Child Welfare Advancement Association of China, Department of Child Research, invited Mrs. Vandervelde, former Foreign Minister of Belgium, current leader of the Socialist Party, and chair of the Second International, to give a lecture at the Industry and Commerce Visiting Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on Hankou Road at 4 PM yesterday. Forty to fifty Chinese and foreign guests attended. Mr. and Mrs. Fu Anlan, principals of the blind children's school, and Chen Zhengfan and Wu Zhou Shujing, executives of the Benevolent and Orphanage Society, served as hosts. Song Wusheng served as the translator. Dr. Luo Yunyan gave a welcoming speech. Mrs. Vandervelde began her lecture, the topic of which was "Hygiene is the Key to Child Welfare." The gist was: "When I was young, I was very concerned about children's health and protection. Later, I studied medicine and became more aware of social medicine. I should first focus on pediatric medicine and devote myself to researching children's health facilities. I am very interested. This time I came to China to investigate the mortality rate of Chinese children, which reaches 15%. And the incidence of congenital diseases and death from tuberculosis and malnutrition reaches 50%, especially among the working class. The reason is that mothers still work in factories during pregnancy, lacking proper care and hygiene. Also, children are made to work in factories before they reach adulthood. It is not like this in European and American countries. Female workers in factories are given assistance in life during pregnancy, and many public hospitals are set up, as well as infant clinics, to examine newborns for congenital diseases and protect them with care. Factories with more than fifty female workers have public nurseries for breastfeeding and absolutely prohibit child labor. During school enrollment, school hygiene includes health checkups for children, and they are often guided to go on outings and absorb fresh air, so that children can receive full education, reduce mortality, and develop healthy citizens in the future."</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of Unfinished Anti-Japanese Association Affairs</h3>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports that, according to visitors from Nanjing yesterday (16th), although the Anti-Japanese Association in this city has been closed for some time, related matters have not been completely resolved.

<h3>Silk Factories Agree on Relief Loan Measures</h3>
<p>The silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, seeing the foreign silk market in a state of collapse and facing huge losses, have declared business closures one after another. They have publicly discussed and appealed to the government to issue silk industry bonds worth 10 million yuan to provide relief. Representatives have been sent to Shanghai to form a special committee for applying for silk industry relief to handle the application and apportionment matters. Two representative conferences have already been convened, and the general outline has been decided as follows: (1) Relief for the entire silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai; (1) Request the government to issue bonds, (Name) Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Silk Industry Bonds, (Amount) 10 million yuan in national currency; (1) Repayment issue, following the customs revenue treasury bond method, with principal and interest to be paid off in five or six years. From the date of issuance, all exported silk will be subject to a surtax of 20 taels of silver per bale to serve as a fund for repaying the bonds. During the repayment period, anyone who is a part of the entire silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, regardless of whether it is a newly established factory or an existing factory, should be jointly responsible for the future of the entire silk industry; (1) The distribution of bonds will be based on the number of machines in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, and will be distributed equally; (1) The distribution procedures and security measures stipulate that those who are eligible for relief are as follows: (1) Those who started operating with new cocoons this year, from June 1st in the lunar calendar; (2) Those who can continue to operate. Those who are not suitable for relief are as follows: (1) Those who have already closed down; (2) Those who do not continue to operate; (3) Those who have not started operating since the new cocoons were listed. Procedures for claiming bonds: (1) Must be jointly signed by the legal representative and the directly responsible shareholders, and bear the obligation to repay. The names and qualifications of the representatives and shareholders must be reported in writing in advance, and valid documents such as partnership agreements or contracts and factory rental contracts must be submitted for review; (1) When claiming bonds, in addition to the signatures of the directly responsible representatives and shareholders, a guarantee letter must be provided; (1) The guarantor's guarantee letter shall guarantee the amount of the loan and the repayment until it is cleared. The above outline has been submitted to Shen Huachen, chairman of the Special Committee for Relief of the Silk Industry, and notified to all silk factories in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai for their information.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Cotton Textile Exhibition Meeting</h3>
<p>The resident Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce National Products Exhibition Hall Cotton Textile Exhibition held a meeting yesterday to discuss the implementation of matters. Xiao Muzhen, technician of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and head of the National Products Exhibition Hall Product Section, as well as solicitation directors Ji Jiannan, Zhu Wenqi, Jiang Dixian, Zheng Hairuo, Jiang Zhonghe, Sun Choucheng, and Xu Qingwen, attended. Ji Jiannan presided. Xiao Muzhen said that the opening date of this cotton textile exhibition, which is scheduled for November 1st in Beijing, coincides with the National Industry and Commerce Conference being held in Beijing. It is of great importance to gather national industry and commerce leaders together to visit the products and discuss methods for improving the cotton textile industry. Moreover, at a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, and the war has just ended, it is a good opportunity to promote domestic products. He hopes that factories will actively participate. He was specially dispatched to Shanghai to assist in handling everything. The solicitation directors reported on the liaison situation one after another. Sun Choucheng reported on the goods that have been received and the factories that have agreed to participate as follows: (Those who have sent goods) Weitong Yarn Factory, Xincheng Sock Factory, Maolong Yarn Factory, Tong'an Electric Weaving Factory, Hefeng Textile Company, Sanyu Industrial Society, Hengfeng Yarn Factory, Datong Textile Company, Huaxin Textile Company, Yong'an Textile Factory, Shenxin Yarn Factory, Hongzhang Textile Factory, Dafeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Zhentai Textile Company, Baofeng Housheng Dafeng and other cotton textile factories, (Willing to sell) Wuhe, Dacheng and other weaving factories, Taihua, Shengda, Guanghua, Samsung, Shanghai Company, Lihua, Sanyou and other factories. It was resolved that personnel would be dispatched again to the factories that have not reported to solicit. Xiao Muzhen also set up a solicitation office every morning to facilitate contact with the factories.</p>
<h3>National Products Association Convened a Representative Assembly of National Product Factories</h3>
<p>▲Preparing to Exhibit in the Soviet Union</p>
<p>The Suzhou General Chamber of Commerce, the YMCA, the Silk Relief Association, and other public organizations, in order to promote commerce after the completion of the expansion project on Guanqian Street, urgently need to hold a mobile exhibition of national products. They jointly sent a letter to the China National Products Maintenance Association, leading the Shanghai National Products Traveling Troupe to Suzhou to participate in the conference, in order to promote national products and expand sales in the interior. This is considered an excellent opportunity. However, this matter is significant, and it is difficult to achieve special effects without joint action. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, together with the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, they convened a representative assembly of all Shanghai national product factories at Nine Acres. Fifty-four companies, including China Chemical Industry Society, Family Industrial Society, Ruyi Xiang, Chen Yuanxing, Huadong Weaving Factory, West Lake Tea Company, Meifeng Silk Factory, Yixin Toothbrush Factory, Xiangtai Weaving Factory, Guanshengyuan, Senyuanxiang, Xiangya Company, Songhexuan, Zhenhua Porcelain Factory, New Continent Umbrella Factory, Longxingxiang, Nanyang Soap Factory, Brothers Industrial Society, China Enamel Factory, and Renchangyong Material Factory, elected Wang Xingyi as chairman and Huang Mengtu as recorder. After the rituals were performed, the chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting and read the letters from various public organizations in Suzhou. Then, representatives expressed their opinions, and it was generally agreed that participation was necessary. It was resolved that the two associations would first select representatives to go to Suzhou to contact various public organizations on all matters related to the exhibition. After the representatives returned to Shanghai, another representative assembly of factories would be convened to elect preparatory committee members to prepare for implementation.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Siam Soliciting National Products</h3>
<p>▲Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>▲Annex to Build a National Products Exhibition Hall</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation yesterday sent a letter to various factories, stating, "We have received a letter from the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, stating, 'We have received a letter from the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, stating that for the purpose of promoting national products, we have specially built a National Products Exhibition Hall next to the association's premises. We have been operating for several months, and the construction has been completed. We have also formulated a simplified collection charter for national products and product descriptions, as well as product application forms. We have sent them separately to commercial factories and shops in coastal provinces and major commercial ports in the country for collection. National products are sent to the association for long-term display and exhibition, for the study and visit of overseas Chinese, in order to increase the glory of national products and promote sales. This association is pioneering the establishment of this long-term national products exhibition hall in the South Seas Islands. Without extensive publicity and collection, it is still insufficient to add luster to national products and create national glory. We hereby send the proposed charter, description, and application form for your review, and request that you forward them to the provincial chambers of commerce for their information, and assist in publicity and collection. We hereby inform your association, and request that you handle it accordingly, and encourage all national product factories to transport products to Siam for display in order to promote them.' We hereby forward this to your association, and request that you handle it accordingly, and encourage all national product factories to transport products to Siam for display in order to promote them."</p>
<h3>Party Members Whose Suspension of Party Rights Has Expired Should Be Restored Immediately by Their Affiliated Party Headquarters</h3>

<h3>Renaming of Deeds for the Yingshi Memorial Hall</h3>
<p>▲The Lake Society Committee Requests to Change the Account Name</p>
<p>The Shousheng Nunnery on Beijing Road in this city, after the order of the National Government to rebuild the Yingshi Memorial Hall, the Lake Society Committee has been actively carrying out this matter. Recently, Chen Qicai, chairman of the Lake Society Committee, stated that the original deeds of the Shousheng Nunnery base were in the name of Shousheng Nunnery and the former custodian Yang Xinzhi. Now that the Yingshi Memorial Hall has been rebuilt, the name is inappropriate. Therefore, yesterday, he submitted a document to the National Government requesting that the Shanghai Local Court be instructed to change the original account name to the name of the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall of the Lake Society. The original document stated, "We respectfully submit this brief report, the Shanghai Society location and the base of the Martyr Chen Gong Yingshi Memorial Hall, built in the Society location, located on Guizhou Road, Beijing Road, Public Concession, the original Deed No. 83 and Deed No. 84, registered by the British company Tonghe Yanghang, issued two Rights Certificate. Because it is the property of the Huzhou Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, fellow villager Yang Xinzhi was appointed as the representative to manage it. The house was used by Shousheng Nunnery, which was managed by our society, so the name on the Rights Certificate was Yang Xinzhi Shousheng Nunnery. Now that we are ordered to change its use, the name on this Rights Certificate should be changed. Yang Xinzhi has already passed away. We propose that your government instruct the Ministry of Judicial Administration to instruct the Shanghai Special Zone Local Court to inform Yang Taiyuan, the son of the deceased Yang Xinzhi, also known as Yang Kuihou, and the Lake Society Committee, to change the original note on the Rights Certificate of No. 83 and No. 84 to the name of the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall of the Lake Society, in order to uphold public property and comply with the final decision."</p>

<h3>Reduced Freight Rates for Jianghai Ships</h3>
<p>▲Disruptions in the Freight Rates of Cotton Yarn on the Upper Yangtze River This year, the number of foreign merchants' ships on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has greatly increased. On the Shanghai-Yichang route, Taikoo has five ships, Jardine Matheson has three ships, Nissin has three ships, and Jiejian has four ships. They are competing for the transportation of cotton yarn. Shanghai's transportation of cotton yarn to Yichang is regarded as the best freight rate in the shipping industry. In recent years, due to excessive competition, the freight rate for yarn has fallen sharply. From Shanghai to Hankou, it has fallen to 2 taels 8 qian 8 fen per piece. From Hankou to Yichang, it has fallen to 4 taels 9 qian 5 fen per piece. Last month, Taikoo Company first reduced the freight rate by 4 taels in order to compete for the transportation of cotton yarn transferred from Hankou to Yichang. The Sanbei Company, due to its contracting nature, reduced the freight rate by 3 taels through the manager of the upper Yangtze River. At that time, Nissin Company also joined the competition, actually collecting 6.95% of the freight rate for yarn. As a result, the price of yarn on the upper Yangtze River suddenly became chaotic. Recently, the British Taikoo Company has taken it a step further and made a second major price cut, reducing the freight rate for cotton yarn from Hankou to Yichang from 4 taels to 2 taels. Combining this with the 2 taels 8 qian 8 fen from Shanghai to Hankou, the freight rate for yarn going to Yichang and transshipped in Hankou is only 4 taels 8 qian 8 fen. The price of direct shipping from Shanghai to Yichang is 6 taels 1 qian 3 fen, causing the recent Shanghai cotton yarn transport to Yichang to be repackaged for transshipment in Hankou, which can save 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen per piece. As a result, there is no yarn to transport on direct ships to Yichang. Recently, various customers have questioned the shipping companies about this contradiction. It was heard yesterday that the companies are meeting to discuss remedial measures.</p>
<p>▲Falling Short of Freight Rates for Goods Transported in the North Sea Recently, due to the restoration of the transportation of goods in Tianjin and the cancellation of the double tax, five shipping companies, including Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Nissin, and China Merchants, have each sent representatives to a meeting to discuss and reduce the freight rates for various export goods. The results of the discussion have been determined, and the new freight rates have been drafted and announced: (1) Ironware, 5 qian 1 fen per dan; (2) White sugar, 5 qian 1 fen per bag; (3) Raw cotton, a reduction of 1 tael 6 qian 7 fen; (4) Cotton yarn, reduced to 8 taels 4 qian 6 fen; (5) Waste paper, reduced to 1 tael 2 fen; (6) Cotton seeds, reduced to 1 tael 3 qian 5 fen; (7) Yarn waste, reduced to 1 tael 8 qian 2 fen; (8) Machine cotton, reduced to 6 taels 6 qian 8 fen; (9) Baled machine cotton, reduced to 8 taels 4 qian 1 fen. The customers have been notified and the new prices are being implemented.</p>
<h3>Unemployed Stewards of Shifts on Various Ships</h3>
<p>▲China Merchants Bureau Formulates Adjustment Measures</p>
<p>The unemployed stewards of the various ships of the China Merchants Bureau requested relief from the Seamen's Union and asked the union to send a letter to the bureau to find a way to resettle them. After receiving the letter from the Seamen's Union, the China Merchants Bureau formulated six remedial measures and replied to the union yesterday. The Seamen's Union still needs to submit these measures to the Reorganization Committee and the Middle Cabin Office for discussion at a meeting before responding to the China Merchants Bureau for a decision. The temporary measures for adjusting the stewards who should be assigned are listed as follows: (1) Stewards who have been assigned to ships for more than half a year and cannot serve on the ship will be subject to these measures. (2) If there is a shortage of stewards on the bureau's sailing ships, or if they have been on leave for more than two months and have not yet returned to work, and stewards who have been assigned to ships for more than half a year and have not served on the ships, the business director of each ship shall report them to the business department. (3) The business department, based on the reports of the business directors, will list the stewards who have been assigned to ships for a long time by sea and river ships and instruct the business directors to resettle them properly. (4) Stewards who have been resettled must be transferred back to serve when the original ship returns. They must not make excessive demands. (5) If the stewards on each ship cannot understand the resettlement issue, causing disputes, the Seamen's Union should be fully responsible for mediation. (6) These measures may be abolished by the bureau at any time when the assignment is over or for special reasons.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Political Workers and Students Telegraph the National Government to Punish Duan Heng Severely</h3>
<p>▲To Vindicate Luo Cheng, the Former Magistrate of Leiyang County</p>
<p>Yesterday, all the students of the Political Workers Training Institute in Shanghai telegraphed the Central Government, saying, "To the Nanjing National Government, we report that Luo Cheng, a student of the Political Workers Training Institute, was innocently shot and killed by Duan Heng, commander of the Southern Hunan Garrison, while serving as the magistrate of Leiyang County, Hunan. The case has been reported to your government by He, chairman of Hunan, for record. On September 28, Duan Heng, commander of the Southern Hunan Garrison and commander of the 55th Brigade of the 19th Division, suddenly drove by car from Hengzhou to the Leiyang County Government. After meeting with Magistrate Luo, he immediately asked why the people of Leiyang were panicking and fleeing to Hengzhou. He immediately replied that there were communist bandits in the county spreading rumors and disrupting the people's minds. They are currently investigating and arresting them strictly. Before he could finish speaking, Duan took out a gun and shot and killed Magistrate Luo. Duan later submitted a report to the provincial government and a telegram to the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, falsely claiming that Magistrate Luo had abandoned his post and disrupted the rear, and executed him. Although Chairman He knew the truth of the case, he leniently dismissed him in order to maintain the local security of more than 20 counties in southern Hunan, which depended on Duan's department. He was still allowed to temporarily hold his concurrent positions in the hope of redeeming himself through meritorious service. Comrade Luo, as a local official, even if he was negligent, his competent authorities would deal with him. There was no need for the military to overstep its authority. Moreover, Comrade Luo supervised the team's clearance and suppression of bandits day and night during his tenure as county magistrate. He never left Leiyang and never abandoned his post or disrupted the rear. It is absolutely unforgivable to shoot and kill a local official without authorization. If the punishment is still lenient due to local security concerns, then soldiers can kill people with impunity. What is the difference between the national discipline and tatters? We hereby telegraph to your seat, based on the original intention of protecting human rights and the righteous act of upholding the national law, immediately telegraph He, chairman of Hunan, to revoke the previous punishment and sentence Duan Heng to the crime he deserves for murder, in order to warn against violence and promote discipline. The political workers training center students respectfully implore."</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Installs Electrical Wires Beyond Concessions</h3>
<p>▲Opposition from Residents in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Luobiegen Road in the East Market of Pusong Town in Western Shanghai was originally built by the Public Works Bureau beyond the concession boundary. Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, the Public Works Bureau suddenly dispatched many workers to install electrical wires beyond the boundary and sent personnel to various shops and residences in the town to solicit the installation of electric lights. The residents of the town, understanding righteousness, all refused. Currently, Sun Shijin, the owner of the Zhenxing Flower Shop, has reported to the Municipal Committee Office. Municipal Committee member Chen Ya'fu, considering the sovereignty involved, could not ignore it and has submitted a report to the Public Utilities Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>▲Hit by the Train While Trying to Avoid It and Died</p>
<p>Liu Zhen'ou, a student at Chih Chih University on Jiangwan Road, was returning home from school at around 11:55 AM yesterday after class.

<h3>A Page of Scandalous History of the Son of a Leather Shop Owner</h3>
<p>▲The Old Father Thought His Son Was Reliable</p>
<p>▲Unexpectedly, the Young Man Made Bad Friends</p>
<p>▲Entangled with a Female Hostess</p>
<p>▲Squandering Over One Thousand Gold Coins of the Shop's Funds</p>
<p>▲Leaving the Shop Affairs to His Son - Xu Yuhe, a local, owner of Xu Shunxing Leather Shop at No. 229, Disiwei Road, Hongkou, recently fell ill and could not attend to business at the shop. He instructed his eldest son, named Zide, to quit school and help with the shop affairs. Zide was only sixteen years old, quite diligent, and very capable in handling matters. Xu was pleased and rested at home to recover.</p>
<p>▲Falling in Love with a Female Hostess - Unexpectedly, Zide was young and impulsive, and was seduced by his peer friend Zhu Shunjin from Anhui, frequently going to the Tianyun Building of Wing On Company for entertainment. He then fell in love with Zhang Naizhen, a local female hostess in the Peking Opera department, aged twenty. From then on, they spent much time together, and their feelings grew deeper. They often rode motorcycles together for excursions in the suburbs.</p>
<p>▲Renting a Room in a Hotel for Secret Rendezvous - Because they could not fully express themselves in public places, they rented a room in the New World Hotel as a rendezvous point. During their leisure time, they also invited Zhang's colleague, hostess No. 3, Afang, to play mahjong together. As a result, the love between Zide and Zhang reached a boiling point, and they engaged in physical relations. They showered each other with affection, and Zide often bought gifts for Zhang to win her favor. However, Zide's financial resources were limited, so he secretly took and used his father's shop funds.</p>
<p>▲Taking Ambiguous Gender Photos - He also went to a photo studio near the City God Temple with Zhu Shunjin and Afang to take photos. Xu and Zhu dressed as women, while Afang dressed as a man, wearing a Western suit and sitting side by side with Xu. Zhu stood behind them, dressed authentically. At first glance, it was difficult to distinguish their genders. After a few days, Xu, Afang, and female hostess No. 6, Aifeng, took another photo of a scene from the Peking Opera "Yellow Crane Tower."</p>
<p>▲Suspecting His Son Was Kidnapped - This went on for several months, and Xu was constantly involved in the world of female entertainers, but his father knew nothing about it. On the 13th of this month, Zide went to Suzhou for sightseeing and did not come to the shop for several days. When someone reported this to his father, Xu Yuhe suspected that his son had been kidnapped by bandits. He went to Zhu Shunjin to inquire, but Zhu said he only knew that Xu Zide had gone to Suzhou for sightseeing and did not know anything else.</p>
<p>▲Finding Out the Truth After Checking the Accounts - Yuhe went to the shop to check the accounts and discovered that Zide had privately used shop funds amounting to a huge sum of 1,968 yuan. He also found two photos, and finally realized that Zide had been engaging in inappropriate behavior outside. Because Zide and Zhu Shunjin were very close friends and often went out together, he notified the owner of Jin Youji Leather Shop at No. 31, East-West Huade Road, to detain Zhu Shunjin.</p>
<p>▲The Three Were Arrested One After Another - He also reported to the Hongkou Police Station, which sent Detective Chen Baozhong. At 8 PM the day before yesterday, Chen learned that Xu Zide had returned to Shanghai and was still playing in the Peking Opera department of the Tianyun Building. He arrested Xu and Zhang Naizhen and went to Jin Youji to bring Zhu Shunjin to the police station. The police chief ordered them to be detained separately.</p>
<p>▲The Police Station Filed a Lawsuit - Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Local Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the police station, explained the case and accused Xu Zide of embezzlement under Article 357, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, and Zhu Shunjin and Zhang Naizhen of defrauding property under Article 363 of the Criminal Code. He then submitted the photos and other evidence. Detective Chen Baozhong then reported the circumstances of the arrest of the defendants, and the plaintiff, Xu Yuhe, testified about the above events.</p>
<p>▲The Deceptive Tactics of the "Ambiguous Gender Gang" - Xu then engaged a lawyer to appear in court, claiming that the plaintiff's son, Zide, was actually under the age of sixteen, ignorant, and easily deceived by others. Zhu Shunjin and Zhang Naizhen are known as the "Ambiguous Gender Gang" in Shanghai. They had already been in cahoots and deliberately lured Zide into their trap to defraud him of money for their own use. He requested that Zide be allowed to be released on bail while awaiting trial.</p>
<p>▲Always Losing in Gambling - When questioned, Xu Zide confessed that he went to the Wing On Company amusement park to relax on the fifth day of the sixth lunar month, where he met Zhu Shunjin. Zhu then introduced him to female hostess Zhang Naizhen to serve tea, and they fell in love. Later, he and Zhang took a car for a ride and rented Room 214 in the New World Hotel, where they played mahjong with Zhu and Afang several times. However, he always lost when gambling.</p>
<p>▲Visiting Friends in Suzhou - Later, he stayed with Zhang at the hotel for several nights. The money used from the shop, about more than one thousand yuan, was all taken by Zhang, who claimed it was for shopping and miscellaneous expenses. He bought a gold watch worth 28 yuan as a gift for Zhang. Zhu did not borrow money from him. He had no improper relationship with the female hostess Afang. The reason for not returning home for the past few nights was that he went to Suzhou to visit friends. After returning to Shanghai, he stayed at the Far East Hotel for two nights, and Zhang came to stay with him one night. The photos were taken with Afang and others at the City God Temple.</p>
<p>▲Denying Staying at the Hotel - Zhu Shunjin confessed that he did not introduce Xu Zide to Zhang Naizhen. The rest of his confession was evasive. Zhang Naizhen confessed that she did not admit to staying with Xu Zide at the World or Far East Hotel. She only played mahjong once. However, Xu was very close to her younger sister, Afang, and she had broken up with him a long time ago.</p>
<p>▲Summoning Witnesses for Further Inquiry - Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confessions and ordered Xu Zide to provide a shop guarantor to be available for questioning at any time. Zhang Naizhen was to provide a 1,000 yuan shop guarantor. Zhu Shunjin was to be held for seven days for investigation, and witnesses were to be summoned for further inquiry.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government to Build the Second Public Housing</h3>
<p>▲Planning to Build 400 Units</p>
<p>▲Expected to be Completed by Next March</p>
<p>To ensure the safety of residents and improve the lives of the poor, the Municipal Government proposed the construction of public housing in May of the 17th year (1928). In October of the same year, a committee was established to plan and implement the project. In May of the 18th year (1929), the first public housing with 100 units was completed on Quanji'an Road. For more than a year, the residents who have moved in have not only benefited physically and mentally, but also received guidance from the managers in their daily lives, which has greatly improved their lives. People from China and abroad have praised the project. However, due to the limited location, the relief is still not widespread enough. It is now learned that the Municipal Government has selected a site in the Lujiawan Xietu Road Luban Road area to build the second public housing. In addition to building a large auditorium, office building, and cooperative store, it is planning to build 400 units. Construction began yesterday and is expected to be completed by March next year. It is expected that another 400 poor families will be able to enjoy the joy of living in peace at that time.</p>
<h3>Transfer of the Three Fierce Bandits Under the Command of Taibao Ashu</h3>
<p>▲Handed Over to the Jiahe Bandit Suppression Department for Interrogation</p>
<p>Pan Guifu, the deputy commander of the bandit Taibao Ashu, previously led bandits to loot various towns in Jiaxing and other places. The Jiahe Bandit Suppression Command dispatched troops to severely suppress them. Pan was unable to resist and fled to Shanghai with his subordinates Tang Songlin, Lu Yingen, etc. The Command learned of this and ordered detective chief Li Nianyuan and others to track them to Shanghai. They then joined forces with Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective from the Laozha Police Station, at the entrance of Huahua World on Nanjing Road to arrest Pan, Tang, and Lu and hand them over to the Special District Court. They were ordered to await further interrogation after evidence was presented. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. After the case was postponed, Detective Li requested Commander Xiong, the General Commander of Bandit Suppression in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, to send detectives to the Special Court to request the transfer for the convenience of the transfer procedures. Therefore, when the case was continued yesterday morning, Commander Xiong sent detectives Wang Bin, Yang Fengqi, etc., with documents to file the case and request the transfer. The Zhejiang Provincial Government also sent a document to the Special Court requesting the transfer. Ru Bao-yi, the police station's lawyer, stated that there were three organizations that wanted to transfer the three defendants, but it was up to the presiding judge to decide which organization to hand them over to. Detective Li then reported the defendants' crimes, and Judge Zhou Han ordered that Tang Songlin, Lu Yingen, and Pan Guifu be handed over to Detective Chief Li Nianyuan of the Jiahe Bandit Suppression Command for investigation, and a letter from the Qingpu Sixth District Office was also handed over for verification.</p>
<h3>The Age Issue in the Freedom of Marriage for Men and Women</h3>
<p>▲Lan Xufang is Less Than Half a Year Short</p>
<p>▲Regretting Her Impatience in Prison</p>
<p>Lan Lianchen's daughter, Lan Xufang, a clerk at Helan Foreign Firm, freely married Chen Mingqi. Lan found out and reported it to the police, who arrested them and transferred them to the Local Court. This matter was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after the preliminary trial by the prosecutor of the Local Court, Chen and Xufang were both detained. The reason for their detention is that Lan Xufang is only twenty years old this year. According to the criminal law, the freedom of marriage without criminal offenses requires that one be twenty years old. That is, one must be twenty-one years old after their birthday to be considered twenty years old. Currently, Lan Xufang is of course less than twenty years old. Therefore, Chen Mingqi is guilty of seducing a woman under the age of twenty for adultery. However, Lan Xufang could have been acquitted, but because she did not want to return to her father, she was detained. Chen Mingqi and Lan Xufang were not unaware of this law. They only knew that they could have freedom of marriage at the age of twenty, but did not fully understand the interpretation of the legal provisions. That is why when Xufang was nineteen years old last year, she was willing to stay in the Women's Association for a year. Only because Xufang's birthday is in February, if she could have waited until February of next year, she would have been fine after only missing half a year. Now, after both men and women have been convicted of a crime, their marriage is even more restricted and cannot be consummated. Therefore, the lawyers of Chen Mingqi and Lan Xufang went to visit them at the detention center yesterday after hearing the news. Lan Xufang still claimed that she had the right to autonomy. After the lawyers explained the law, she regretted her impatience. However, her personal will remains true to her original intention.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents' Anti-Gambling Movement</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Japanese community leaders in Shanghai gathered at the Japanese Club to discuss the anti-gambling movement. The Japanese Deputy Ambassador Shigemitsu, Acting Consul General Wangpu, Police Chief Huali, and community business leaders Miyari, Fukushima, Miyazaki, and Lin, and more than forty people attended the meeting to discuss ways to prevent Japanese residents from going to horse racing, dog racing, and other gambling venues. Finally, it was decided that Fukushima, Lin, Miyari, Anju and others would form a committee to formulate a concrete plan, and then work with the Japanese consul to implement it. It is said that the reason why the Japanese community launched the anti-gambling movement was because they saw that countless Japanese residents often went to horse racing, dog racing, and other gambling venues, resulting in various criminal acts such as embezzlement, fraud, and theft. Young store clerks were the most affected. If measures are not taken to stop it quickly, the entire Japanese community will be affected.</p>
<h3>Prohibition of Overloading Passengers on Inland River Vessels</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government recently received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction, stating, "In order to comply with the order, it has recently been found that inland river vessels often seek short-term profits and overload passengers, resulting in dangerous situations. A strict prohibition order should be issued to ensure safety. In addition to sending it out separately, it is hereby issued a proclamation ordering the county magistrate to instruct all shipping companies to affix the number of passengers stipulated by the Customs on the ship in a place where passengers can easily see it. The number of passengers must comply with the number limit on the sign, and the proclamation should be forwarded to the shipping companies, ordering them to install glass frames and hang them in the ship's cabins for compliance and easy inspection. The county construction bureau chief should also be supervised to strictly implement it, and a report should be submitted for investigation. This is the order."</p>
<h3>Effectiveness of the National Products Promotion Week</h3>
<p>▲The Silk and Satin Industry has Generally Improved</p>
<p>The third National Products Promotion Week in Shanghai was held on October 9th with a national products fashion exhibition at the Dahua Hotel, and on the 13th of this month, a national silk and satin exhibition was held. The ladies who attended were very enthusiastic, which was unprecedented in previous sessions, as reported in this newspaper. According to people in the silk and satin industry, since the exhibition, there has been a significant effect, and the business of various silk and satin stores has improved. The Dashin Silk and Satin Bureau on Shilu Road is the most prominent. It is said that the bureau's new opening was at a low price for only five days, so after 12:00 noon every day, the bureau's customers were unusually crowded, and they were overwhelmed. This shows that the psychology of Chinese people loving and using national products has become increasingly widespread.</p>
<h3>Falling Rice Prices in Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲The Source is Becoming More and More Abundant</p>
<p>The price of rice in Shanghai has gradually decreased recently. New rice from various production areas has been harvested, and the harvest is unusually abundant, so it has been transported to Shanghai for sale, resulting in crowded arrivals. The arrival of new and sharp rice is even more prosperous. Su, Song, Jia, and Hu have 20 arrivals every day, and dozens of trains of Huaiyang guest rice are loaded every day. Therefore, the goods on the market are accumulating more and more, but sales are weak. The stores see the number of arrivals flourishing and the market price falling, so they are watching the purchase to avoid losses. Therefore, there is a market but no transactions. The owners see the market sluggish and need to sell quickly, so they have to reduce prices, which makes the market even more tired. The largest sales of Su Tong new rice are 14.56 yuan, and Songjiang new rice is 13.23 yuan to 13.56 yuan. The new rice has the largest number of arrivals and inventory, and it has reached 10 yuan for entry and 9.56 yuan to 9.78 yuan. However, Huaiyang telegrams are urging distributors to sell the goods quickly, several times a day. According to the industry, the source is so prosperous at the beginning of the new rice season. If there is no packing and hoarding on the stack in winter, the price of japonica rice is expected to fall to around 10 yuan.</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Murder</h3>
<p>▲ Liu Youlong and others taken into custody separately</p>
<p>The gangster Liu Youlong, nicknamed "Pockmarked Long," on the afternoon of the first of this month, gathered his gang members Cao Shunchu (aka Little Cao), Sun Asi, Zhu Tianfu, Jiang Shaosheng, Li Agen, Lu Asan, Zhou Gensheng, Ai Ashun, Ge Acai, etc., each wielding sharp axes and handguns, and went to the Dafang Stack entrance on Min'guo Road, Fujian Road, in the French Concession, intending to seek revenge on Sun Zhongmou. Fortunately, Sun saw the situation was unfavorable and immediately fled into the Chinese territory. Liu and others were about to pursue him when they were intercepted by French Concession detectives Chen Sanlin, patrol officers Mao Jinsheng, Lu Jinchen, Bao Tan Gu Mingzhou, Jiang Changwen, etc. They stepped forward, apprehended Liu and the others one after another, confiscated the sharp axes and weapons, and took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought before the French court for investigation.</p>
<p>First, Sun Zhongmou testified, stating that he was twenty-one years old and worked as a runner at the Trading Company at 567 Shanxi Road. On September 30th, the merchant encountered Liu Youlong at Xiaodongmen. Liu immediately accused the merchant of having an affair with his teacher's wife and forcefully demanded a loan of 300 yuan. The merchant refused because it was untrue. Liu then threatened him, saying that if he didn't lend the money, he would use an axe against him. The merchant ignored him and they parted ways. Unexpectedly, at 3 PM on October 1st, the merchant was walking from the Chinese territory to the entrance of Dafang Stack at Xiaodongmen when he saw Liu leading more than ten people, intending to provoke him. As a result, the merchant fled into the Chinese territory, fortunately protected by the police, and was not harmed. Otherwise, he would have been murdered. Now that they have been arrested, he requests a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Questioned, Liu Youlong confessed that he was twenty-five years old, from Ningbo, and used to work at a laundry. After losing his job, he associated with gangsters and worshipped Han Ahu, also known as "Woof Woof" Ahu, as his "old man." It was because Sun Zhongmou had an affair with his teacher's wife, Lao Qi, the wife of Han Ahu. After he discovered this, Sun initially agreed to pay him 300 yuan as compensation. Unexpectedly, Sun not only failed to pay but also gathered many people to beat him. Therefore, he harbored resentment and gathered his brothers on this day, hoping to murder Sun.</p>
<p>Cao Shunchu and others testified similarly, confirming that they were indeed invited by "Pockmarked" Long to assist in the crime. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Liu Youlong to 18 months in the Western prison, Cao Shunchu, Sun Asi, and Zhu Afu to one year each, and Li Agen, Jiang Shaosheng, and the other six to nine months each. Upon completion of their sentences, they will all be permanently expelled from the Concession. The confiscated axes were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Verification of the Death of a Prisoner</h3>
<p>Jin Hengcan, a local, forty-one years old, worked as an accountant in the Customs Department of Jardine Matheson in the New Yong'an Street of the French Concession. This spring, he was accused in the French court of privately opening iron boxes and embezzling a huge sum of money. The court found him guilty and sentenced him to imprisonment, which he was serving. Recently, Jin fell ill in prison, and medical treatment was ineffective. He died on the 14th. The prison guard notified Tongren Fuyuantang, who sent laborers to carry the body to the morgue. At the same time, the police station informed the deceased's family. Yesterday, Jin Ruizhan, the son of the deceased, purchased clothing and a coffin for the body, which was transported back to his hometown for burial.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Manslaughter Case Against the Foreman</h3>
<p>▲Further Investigation is Required to Ascertain the Truth</p>
<p>Dong Dexing, a small worker from Anhui in the flannel workshop of the Ewo Yarns Mill, through a lawyer, has accused the foremen of the mill, Wang Jiekui, Wang Guofang, and Wang Jiexian, of conspiring to assault him with axes on the morning of August 6th, at 6:00 AM, with the intent to murder him, which they failed to achieve. The Special Court has already held three hearings, ordering the detention of Wang Jiekui, and requiring Wang Guofang and Wang Jiexian to each post a 1,000-yuan bail. This has already been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangfeng, who is in charge of this case, continued the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. The defendants were also represented by three lawyers, Chen Tingrui, Fan Gang, and Ding Rong. The plaintiff, Dong Dexing, repeated his previous accusations and testified that the defendant Wang Jiekui was at the scene giving commands to strike, and that he was still wearing the same clothes he wore that day. Furthermore, witnesses Zhang Songbai and Ye Xirong testified, presenting evidence. However, Ye testified that Wang Jiekui was wearing gray clothes at the time of the incident, which was greatly different from Zhang's testimony. The Western factory manager of Ewo Yarns Mill also testified, proving that the three defendants worked in the factory with good conduct and had never had any faults. Subsequently, the lawyer Chen Tingrui, representing the defendants, stated that his firm had obtained Dong Dexing's report to the Yangshupu police station from that day, signed by the police chief. The report stated that there were more than thirty assailants at the time, all unknown by name, and that the incident occurred at the intersection of Yangzhou Road and Taopeng Road. However, Dong now testifies that the incident occurred in front of No. 61, Xin Kang Li, Yangzhou Road, and that he saw Wang Jiekui commanding the assault, with a total of seven people. The testimony differs from the report and should be carefully examined. Judge Cheng reported that further investigation of the case was necessary, and postponed the hearing for seven days, issuing a subpoena for the police chief to bring the records to the court for further verification.</p>
<h3>Sampan Operator Tragically Drowns</h3>
<p>▲ Sailors Act Unreasonably</p>
<p>Xin Dingchang, a thirty-year-old man from Ningbo, operated sampan No. 130, carrying passengers for a living in the Yangshupu area. At 7 PM the night before, the sampan was docked near the Witama Road pier in Yangshupu, and then docked between buoys 10 and 13 of the Shanghai Customs Station. Two French sailors from the Chenonceaux merchant ship hailed Xin's sampan from the shore to ferry them to the ship. After the two sailors paid and boarded the ship, another French sailor on board wanted to go ashore, so he took Xin's sampan to the shore. At that time, the sampan had not yet left the ship, and another Frenchman on board also wanted to take Xin's boat to the shore. Xin agreed, asking one of the sailors to wait a moment. However, the sailor had no sense and was impatient. Without hearing Xin's explanation, the sailor grabbed Xin and started punching and kicking him. Xin was unprepared and was suddenly knocked into the river, sinking to the bottom, resulting in a tragic drowning. Seeing the trouble he caused, the sailor took another boat to shore. Later, Xin's father, Hesheng, learned of the incident. He believed that his son had died tragically and that the French sailor treated Chinese lives worse than chickens and dogs. Therefore, he went to the police station and cried out, demanding justice. He claimed that his son and he depended on operating the sampan for a living, and that the French sailor acted unreasonably and used violence. He requested an investigation. At the same time, two sampan operators, Ge Amao of No. 1156 and Zhu Gengsheng of No. 795, arrived at the police station and testified about the French sailor's actions. The police chief immediately dispatched detective Deng Jiagen to investigate the ship. He instructed Xin's father to wait for notification from the French Consulate for verification.</p>

<h3>Year-End Accounting in the Gregorian Calendar</h3>
<p>▲ Problems Persist Among Merchants</p>
<p>The year-end accounting in the Gregorian calendar this year cannot be delayed any further. However, businesses dealing in beans, rice, Southern goods, and daily necessities rely on the winter season for their annual business opportunities. The Gregorian New Year falls in mid-November of the Lunar calendar, when people buy more goods than usual, and the stores are fully stocked. If the financial community wants to settle the year's debts at this time, it would be difficult to achieve from a practical standpoint. Therefore, the rice industry once submitted a request to the Bureau of Social Affairs to forward to the Central Government, requesting accommodation, and also sent a letter to the Money Exchange Association to inform its members to allow for flexibility and postpone the year-end accounting until the end of January next year. Afterwards, the Money Exchange Association did not express its opinion, and is awaiting the government's approval.</p>

Later, the Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake and Bean Industry Guild requested an extension until October 12th, which was announced. Now, representatives from the Shanghai Grain, Oil Cake and Bean Industry Guild, Ye Huijun, Cai Yukun, Zhu Yunliang, Jiang Lansheng, She Bingwen, etc., have requested another extension until October 20th, stating that registering inventory and inspecting new goods requires investigation, preparation, and complicated procedures, which are difficult to complete in a short time. This has been approved, and it has been decided that all wheat arriving in Shanghai before October 20th must be registered at the office by October 20th. From October 21st, the temporary regulations for wheat inspection must be followed, and both old and new goods transported in transit must be processed as new goods. However, after this extension, no further extensions will be granted. A corresponding letter is sent to your chamber of commerce to inform your members. The letter stated that since the deadline for free registration was requested and set by the representatives of the industries concerned, it would be difficult to extend it again. In addition to sending separate letters to the industries concerned to inform them, a corresponding letter is sent to your association to inform all members.</p>

<h3>Fire in Western Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>At around 10 PM last night, a fire suddenly broke out at a business on Connaught Road in western Shanghai. The smoke was thick and the fire lit up the sky. The fire brigade rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and extinguished the fire after some time. Statistics show that two or three city houses were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the sky will be mostly cloudy with fog in the morning. Northwesterly winds will strengthen north of Shandong, while there will be northeasterly to southeasterly winds to the south. There is a low-pressure system in Jiangxi. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 80.6 degrees and the lowest was 58.4 degrees.

<p>▲ Correction: In the report yesterday about the kidnapping suspect Gu Aqing, there was a slight error in the words of Judge Xu to the police station regarding the lawyer's statement. At that time, Judge Xu declared, "During the investigation, if exculpatory evidence favorable to the defendant is discovered, it may be brought to court for trial at any time before the scheduled date," and not that the complaint was withdrawn. This is specifically corrected.</p>
<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the news in your newspaper's local news column on the 16th of this month regarding relief efforts for silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, it stated that our factory is foreign-owned, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. The format of our factory's machinery is indeed different from that of most factories in Shanghai, but all shareholders are Chinese merchants, and almost all are well-known in the Shanghai industry. Therefore, we are writing this letter specifically to correct the record and restore the truth. We wish you peace.</p>
<p>From,</p>
<p>Rixin Improved Silk Factory</p>
<p>October 16th</p>
<p>Dear Sirs,</p>
<p>Having read the fourth page of your newspaper dated the 16th of this month, it stated that the Forensic Examination Office would begin investigating the Western Prison today and that it had been specially approved by Mr. Yang Zhaoxun, the president of the Commercial District Local Court, to inspect the Western Prisons on Huade Road today and Xiamen Road tomorrow. However, the Forensic Examination Office has not made any proposals to the Special District Court. All the details stated in your newspaper are not factual. Please make corrections.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shen Bao</p>
<p>October 16th</p>
<p>Esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I read in today's newspaper that Gu Ziqing, who was arrested, was described as the manager of the Daming Glasses Company, which is actually a rumor. My late father was a shareholder of the Dalian Shanghai Glasses Company. Please correct this. I would be grateful.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Seafarer</p>
<p>▲ Policeman (to a beggar): What is your name? Where do you live?</p>
<p>Beggar: You want to know my name and address? I am called Common People. I live at No. 1 Open Air. If you condescend to visit, there is no need to knock. Just come in.</p>
<p>▲ Math Teacher: Children, suppose there is a plate here, with a cake on it. I bring it in and cut it with a knife, and divide it among you to eat. Student A eats one-fifth. Student B eats one-fifth. Student C eats one-fifth. I myself eat two-fifths. How much is left?</p>
<p>A Student: Teacher, there is still a plate left.</p>
<p>▲ Mother (scolding her young daughter): You girls should know etiquette from a young age. For example, when you come down the stairs, you must be light on your feet and not make any noise. Do you understand?</p>
<p>Daughter: I understand. I'll go upstairs to try it now. (Goes upstairs. Returns to the room after a while.)</p>
<p>Mother: That was good. You came downstairs and I didn't hear a sound.</p>
<p>Daughter: Mother, I slid down the banister of the stairs. It was fast and there was no noise.</p>

<h3>Excerpts from Wu Zhihui's Speech</h3>
<p>— Jia Ming</p>
<p>A National Day celebration was held by West Lake. No fewer than 50,000 people from various agencies, schools, and factories participated. The weather that day was bright and cheerful. A solemn and enthusiastic atmosphere filled the entire venue. In addition to Central Committee members Chen Guofu and Cheng Jian, and Department Heads Zhou Cai and other executive members of the Party headquarters, Mr. Wu Zhihui, who named the "Double Tenth Festival," also arrived after attending a provincial government meeting in car number seven. Wu was bald and wore a Yuan-style mandarin jacket made of woolen fabric. When he took the stage, photographers scrambled to take pictures. Wu stood up and smiled in response. He sometimes looked at promotional materials, using his old-fashioned copper-rimmed reading glasses. His simplicity was evident. He stood up to give a speech amidst applause from thousands of people, blending solemnity and humor, with words that were exceptionally wonderful. I noted them down to enrich this discussion.</p>
<p>▲ Top-Quality Imported Goods</p>
<p>Sixty years ago, Chinese people were always startled when they saw blue-eyed foreigners. Everyone praised and admired those who had straight legs, white skin, and looked like monkeys. Because they were imported goods, because they were top-quality imported goods.</p>
<p>▲ Fighting for the Honor of Yellow Faces</p>
<p>China had Yao, Shun, and the Yellow Emperor six thousand years ago. Which country in the world can compare? Most countries didn't have scholars until the time of Confucius. Although Egyptian civilization was also early, look at their wall paintings, what are they like? The Three Principles of the People were invented by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. It can be said to be the best in the world, and it can also be said to be the crystallization of six thousand years of thought. Because of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, we can fight for the honor of yellow faces.</p>
<p>▲ Writing an Insurance Policy</p>
<p>The applicability of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's principles is suitable for at least a thousand years. If I were to write an insurance policy like in a clock shop, I would boldly write a guarantee for a thousand years without hesitation.</p>
<p>▲ What is Marx?</p>
<p>Marxism, Niu Marxism, causing a chaotic mess. The theory is not worth refuting. It's just because he was born fifty years earlier, so what he saw and heard was not as profound as Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He took the wrong path, just like I wrote stereotyped essays for thirty years.</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Fei and Niu Gao Represent Black People</p>
<p>We shouldn't only say that white people are good. Who knows if black people will dominate in the future? Our ancient Zhang Fei and Niu Gao were all black-faced.</p>
<p>▲ The Premier's Will Includes the Entire Constitution</p>
<p>Speaking of political tutelage, let me give an example: Yi Yin assisting Tai Jia, the Duke of Zhou assisting King Cheng. Mr. Sun Yat-sen said that 400 million people are the emperor, which is also A Dou. Now, the period of political tutelage is necessary for 400 million emperors to understand the Three Principles of the People and to establish a constitution when the National Assembly is convened to govern the Republic of China. In fact, a constitution is not just any provisional law, it is already included in the Premier's will.</p>
<h3>Zhongda Confers Honorary Doctorates on Foreigners Fan and Lin, a Grand Event</h3>
<p>— Xie Fei</p>
<p>▲ A Zhongda Initiative</p>
<p>National Central University has conferred honorary doctorates on Mr. Fandewen from Belgium and Mr. Lin Baike from the United States. Both men have come to Nanjing and possess profound academic knowledge and extensive writings, making many contributions to world culture. They are especially enthusiastic about supporting our country's abolition of unequal treaties and our Party's Three Principles of the People, doing their best to promote them. Therefore, following the precedents of universities around the world, Mr. Fandewen was awarded an honorary Doctor of Literature degree, and Mr. Lin Baike was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. This was specially approved by the University Affairs Council in advance, and a committee was organized to handle the doctorate conferment ceremony. It is an unprecedented initiative.</p>
<p>▲ A Tall Decorated Archway</p>
<p>The certificate presentation ceremony was held in the university gymnasium at 5:00 PM on the 9th of this month. As the next day was National Day, the decorations were extremely splendid. Outside the school gate, a tall decorated archway was erected, with the words "National Central University Confers Honorary Doctorates on Fandewen and Lin Baike." Inside the gate, the path leading to the gymnasium was very wide. In the shade of willows and tung trees, Party and national flags and red lanterns congratulating National Day were countless. When the day passed, thousands of red stars could be seen, rippling in the moonlight like water, giving people a sense of freshness.</p>
<p>▲ Arriving Late</p>
<p>After 3:00 PM, attendees arrived one after another. By 4:30 PM, the upper level was full, and later arrivals were still like a tide. However, after repeated delays and anticipation, the two doctors finally appeared on the red and green floral altar at 5:30 PM amidst thunderous applause.</p>
<p>▲ A Talented President</p>
<p>Before the certificates were presented, President Zhang Naiyan gave a report, roughly as described in the first paragraph. First in Chinese, then in French, and then in English, because French is used in Belgium and English in the United States.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Fandewen's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Fandewen also gave a speech titled "International Economic Relations." He said that in modern times, due to convenient transportation, international relations have arisen. China used to be closed and self-sufficient, but was broken down by foreigners, hence the movement to recover tariffs and achieve autonomy today. I sincerely hope it can be realized soon. Recently, France advocated the so-called European Federation issue, but it must start with economic union, which is hopeless given today's environment. European economy can be divided into two sides: one agricultural, one industrial. Politics also differs accordingly. Eastern Europe is the world of manpower and animal power, while Western Europe is the world of motors. The latter uses coal and machinery, the former uses manpower and animal power. Their evolution is different, and their strength is different. Only the world that uses motors relies on force and technology as a backing. The former, that is, the agricultural countries of other continents, can rise up and advance, countering each other, and can also apply electricity to agricultural improvements, avoiding the mistakes of Europe and the United States, and avoiding the errors of imperialism. His inventions are a blessing for the whole world, and true peace can be realized.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Lin said that he was deeply touched by Mr. Fandewen's speech. He believed that there are only three countries in the world that are self-sufficient: China, the United States, and Russia. China has vast land and abundant resources, like a world of its own, and can survive on its own. It is only because of foreign constraints that it cannot be free. Recently, the people of China have been working hard on this and have become more aware. Those in power are especially eager to develop Chinese industries, which is very promising. He also said that seeking knowledge is to obtain true happiness. Knowledge that is not harmonious and fluid is not true knowledge. Like Mr. Sun Yat-sen, it is not just for knowledge, but for the happiness of all. Before and after his speech, he respectfully bowed three times to the portrait of the Premier.</p>
<p>▲ Our Way is Western</p>
<p>Mr. Lou Tongsun, the representative of the Municipal Party Department, said: "Mr. Fandewen and Mr. Lin each hold a diploma to return with, which is like holding a flag of our country. Our way is Western. Both gentlemen are of high moral character and respected, and their scholarship shakes China and foreign countries. Today, they receive this honor, which is well deserved. I sincerely hope that in thirty years, there will be two people in the audience today who will each seize a flag and return."</p>
<h3>Thinking of Western Medicine from National Products</h3>
<p>— Cocoa</p>
<p>Recently, Shanghai is holding a national products movement. National products, national products, the words fill the ears. I think that there are more and more national products for daily use. All citizens should use them as much as possible. However, the overseas imports of medical and pharmaceutical products are increasing year by year. Especially various over-the-counter medicines. They are convenient to take and sell in large quantities. Just conduct a brief survey of the market and you will find it hard to list them all. Although medicine has no national boundaries, considering the huge amount of leakage, we should be disheartened. It is advisable to expect those with aspirations in the pharmaceutical industry to work hard to create and produce them, so that they can meet the needs of our people. Fortunately, in recent years, pharmacies have been doing some research and gradually producing products. For example, there are Weitamins 54 and other brands of beef juice. For cod liver oil emulsion, there are Jiufu, Jiuxing, and other brands. There are even more brands of malt extract. There is also a kind of Yar's preparation, which is made from the essence of cod liver oil, without its fishy taste. It has always been popular among the intellectual class, and is favored by those who are weak, coughing, and in the early stages of lung disease. It used to be an imported product only, and the annual sales are alarming. Recently, there is also a considerable amount of national product, namely the so-called Bulito. All of these are only a small part of over-the-counter medicines, but I hope to progress and develop day by day from this. From two or three kinds to hundreds of kinds. From small parts to large parts. And from over-the-counter medicines to raw materials. It is hoped that in the future, all medical treatment will not need to be sought abroad. This can be called the ultimate goal of promotion. The gentlemen in the pharmaceutical industry should strive for it.</p>
<h3>Italian Art Study Notes (4)</h3>
<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>(4) The Pitti Palace. Palace Pitti is in Florence, west of the beautiful Arno River. It is surrounded by a wide square. The palace is located on the plateau of the square. It was originally a royal palace built with huge stones. It is surrounded by woods. Looking from the plateau, you can see the distant scenery outside the city. This is one of the grand palaces in Florence. It was built in 1444. From 1550 to 1895, it was the private residence of the Duke of Tuscany. Although it is now an art gallery, it is still owned by the royal family. Entering the gallery, go straight to the third floor. From the first room to the sixth room, there are large murals. The decorations when the Duke lived there are still preserved. The interior is exquisite, with incredible painted beams and carved pillars. Each mural is different. Looking up at the stone pillars painted on the ceiling, connected to the buildings below, they look like real objects, difficult to distinguish. Italian murals are famous in the world, especially the murals in palaces and aristocratic residences, all of which are masterpieces by famous artists of the time, making us linger. The gallery displays not only Italian masterpieces, but also more than twenty masterpieces from the Netherlands and Spain.</p>
<p>Painting in Spain and the Netherlands in the seventeenth century was very distinctive. But they all accepted the style of the High Renaissance and continued to inspire it. Morillo of Spain and Rubens of the Netherlands both studied in Florence. Their skills advanced rapidly, surpassing those of Italy at the time. Now, the works of Spain and the Netherlands are displayed in this gallery, all of which are collections from the palace in the past, and are extremely precious.</p>
<p>There are more antiques in this gallery, and also many paintings, but not as complete as the Uffizi Gallery. The two major galleries in Florence are the Uffizi and the Pitti. The other masterpieces are scattered in various churches. To study Italian painting and sculpture, in addition to the two galleries, one must also explore the murals of various temples to see their full extent.</p>
<p>(5) The Church of Santa Croce. St. Croce The church is located in the city of Florence. In front of it is a large open space. In the middle of the space stands a stone statue of the poetic saint Dante, more than ten feet high. This statue is a work by Michelangelo. The expression of Dante is carved to perfection. Below the statue is a stone platform with four lions. The shape of the lions is not carved according to nature, but has a style of ancient Greece. To the right of the church, there is another ancient temple. It displays a large mural by Giotto Giollo. Below depicts "The Last Supper." Above depicts "The Ascension of Jesus." This painting is very precious in history. Tickets must be purchased to enter here, which is different from other places.</p>
<h3>European Travelogue (79)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>▲ Diary of Touring Italy</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (2)</p>
<p>— The Eternal City — La Ville eternelle</p>
<p>June 1 — Spanish Masterpiece Exhibition and Japanese Modern Art Exhibition</p>
<p>The roads in Rome are winding and circuitous due to the high and low terrain of the hills and the avoidance of many historical sites. They are completely different from the straight avenues of Paris. However, what is easiest to feel is that the stone pillars and sculptures in the squares and even the decorations on the fountains in Paris clearly imitate the relics of ancient Rome, but they just enlarge the form. That's how it is. Even the famous Arc de Triomphe of Napoleon in Paris is just an enlarged model of the Roman style.</p>
<p>The architecture of the new art gallery is also very magnificent. This imitation-classical stone building is decorated with light reliefs on both sides. We stepped into it from dozens of majestic stone steps. In front of the door are many huge stone pillars. A banner of the Spanish Masterpiece Exhibition is hung in the center. It is very solemn and eye-catching. The names ElGreco, Goya, Velazquez, Zurbaran Murillo, De Ribera, Lopez, Lucas, and Carducho are written on the banner. With a satisfied smile, I calmly walked into the second door. I saw huge sculptures displayed in the inner courtyard. It was already enough to make us praise. Walking straight to the left, it was the Spanish exhibition. Walking inside, I saw the famous masterpiece "The Tears of St. Peter" by El Creco, which I had seen in prints. Most of this room is filled with El Greco's masterpieces. Further on are the paintings of Velazquez and Murillo. Further in are the paintings of Bayeu Carducho Ribera and Goya. Finally, there are the paintings of Lopez Lucas and Zubaran. The total number of paintings is sixty-six. Ten by El Greco, four by Murillo, seven by Velazquez, four by Ribera, seven by Goya. The rest I don't remember clearly. It was an unexpected pleasure for me to see so many masterpieces of Spanish masters in Rome. Although I knew about the Spanish school of painting before and liked the paintings of El Greco and Goya, I never had a thorough understanding of them. Now I have realized the true meaning of these masterpieces. Especially after reading their history and biographies, I imagined their works as being full of rich vitality. However, it is futile to have no chance to see the works in person. Now I have seen them all. It is what I understand and appreciate. This can be considered the first happy event in my life.</p>

Japanese banks received more than 3.4 million in various bills, 600,000 out of the warehouse, and more than 2 million in certain settlement bills. Money shops and silver public offices received more than 34 million in individual bills, more than 3.9 million in cash order bills, more than 1.1 million in remittance bills from various routes, and tens of thousands in cash. (Silver) The early market for remittance bills was 1.705 million, and the afternoon market was 1.193 million. There were no transactions in the early market for banknotes, and 5,000 in the afternoon market.

<h3>Long-Term Interest Rate Opens at 9.5%</h3>
<p>▲Pawnshops at 8.5%</p>
<p>The long-term funds that are due this time are not dared to be relaxed due to various reasons, so there are no large transactions even after a long time. It is found that the recent interest rates for long-term funds in the silver and money industry are sparse. The large-scale transactions in the market have not yet started. In the past two days, it was heard that the financial sector has made a few regulations on the due transfer funds of Shenxin, Fuxin, and the three factories, and the interest rate is still 9.5%, which is comparable to the price in April. In addition, pawnshops have made a few, and the interest rate is 8.5%. Most of the wholesale businesses in the foreign firm street area and most of the large stores have not made regulations. According to people in the financial industry, the funding for this long-term loan is one-third more than the first half of the year, and there are no suitable borrowers for a while, so they have to wait and see the opportunity. As for the level of interest rates, it is difficult to be opportunistic in the current dilemma.</p>
<h3>The Securities and Government Bond Market Is as Silent as Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the inflow and outflow of government bond spot goods were still rare, with only 16,000 yuan traded throughout the day. The futures market was even more deserted, with more than 2.1 million traded in the morning session and more than 1.9 million yuan in the afternoon session, totaling 4.11 million yuan. Among them, demobilization accounted for 1.31 million, demobilization and the 1919 customs tariff each accounted for about 700,000 yuan, customs tariff accounted for more than 500,000 yuan, and other bonds were slightly opened, and the transactions were extremely rare. As of yesterday, the changes in various bonds were due to buying and selling waiting and seeing, and the balance of supply and demand. The trend was more sluggish than before, and the front and rear markets mostly hovered within a few points. As a result, there were still ups and downs compared with the previous day, with the 1926 bond falling by 6 points, and the others changing by only about 2 points. In addition, the 1919 customs spot goods alone fell by 3.5 yuan compared with the opening at the beginning of last week.</p>

<h3>The Cotton Yarn Market Returns to a Soft State</h3>
<p>The yarn market has fallen again. The recent changes in the market are rapid. The world situation is really weak, and there is no reason to rise. However, manufacturers vigorously purchase when it falls, so it rebounded the day before yesterday. Now, foreign cotton is falling, and retail investors are competing to sell. At the same time, spot yarn sales are increasingly deserted, so the market sentiment is trending downward again. However, manufacturers are still entering, so the market has not yet seen a major fall.</p>
<p>▲Standard Selling Pressure: The human index opened in the morning market, with American cotton being weak and spot yarn news being poor, and the downward trend started again. Each fell by 5-6%, and Xin Cheng purchased slightly and returned. As a result, each fell by 5-6-7-8-9%. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were stagnant, and the popularity was still scattered. Each month fell by another 3-4-5-7%. The total transaction volume for the day was 18,250 bales. It was found that Shenxin sold 1,250 bales, Hengfeng 1,000 bales, Maoji 700 bales, Guangfeng 700 bales, Yiyu 650 bales, and the rest 3-500 bales. Yuantai purchased 1,350 bales, Xincheng 1,400 bales, Yongfeng 550 bales, and the rest 5-600 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

Among the customer groups, 100 bales were entered in Zhenjiang, 155 bales were entered in Shantou, 55 bales were entered inland, and 110 bales were entered by miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market's Declining Trend Is Becoming Increasingly Apparent</h3>
<p>The cotton market, which has been brewing for a long time, has been tightly held by the multiple parties. Now, with the American cotton falling even more sharply, the scattered bulls are gradually showing signs of panic, and it has tragically fallen by 6%. Indian cotton prices are quite cheap, and various foreign firms are eager to find a way out. However, various factories are afraid to buy due to the bad general trend. The new cotton in Hankou is becoming increasingly prosperous on the market, and the price is loosening. The bandits in the inland are slightly quieter, so the shipment of yarn has increased, and a part of it is sold in Shanghai. Yuda Han Group has closed out more than 10,000 loads of bulls, so the market has taken a sharp turn downwards. However, most of the inland groups have not yet emerged, and some of them have already shaken, showing signs of unease. There are also many who are reluctantly closing out, so each month has fallen below the 1-2% mark.</p>
<p>▲Human Index Falls Sharply: The human index opened in the morning market, with American cotton trending downward, showing signs of a sharp decline. The bulls closed out, and the selling was quite strong. Each fell by 3-4%. In the afternoon, it was heard that Indian cotton prices fell by another 5-6%, and Japanese firms sold out. Each month fell by another 1.5-3%. The total transaction volume for the day was 80,300 loads. It was found that Yuda sold 10,000 loads, Jinfeng 3,300 loads, Rongxing 2,700 loads, Xiesheng 2,000 loads, and the rest 1,5-600 loads. Yongfeng purchased 7,300 loads, Yiyu 3,200 loads, Meiji 3,000 loads, Hengyi 3,900 loads, Ruidaji 4,300 loads, and the rest 1,5-600 loads. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲Spot Transactions Are Blocked: Spot cotton business is cut off. All factories have no appetite. The selling price of Indian cotton fell by 5-6% compared to yesterday. The source is estimated to be 1,500 bales of Yao cotton and 270 bales of Tong cotton.</p>

<h3>American Cotton's Decline Is Increasingly Severe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was firm at first due to unfavorable weather forecasts, but later it was tired due to Western selling and bull closing. The futures fell by 11-18 points, and the spot fell by 20 points. English cotton futures rose by 1 point, and spot rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot rose by 20 points. Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left (16th telegram).</p>

<h3>The Grain and Rice Market Continues to See Sharp Declines</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, more than 40 boats arrived at Xiang Road. Market sales were increasingly sluggish. The supply of new japonica rice surged, and the price fell by 3-4 cents. Top-quality goods opened at 16 yuan, and ordinary goods were all at 15.5 yuan. The situation is still difficult to stand. The price of thin rice is slightly soft, and Yangxian is falling step by step. Yesterday, it fell by about 3 cents again. Dujian sales are not weak in retail sales, so the price is only a small 2 cents. High-quality goods opened at 12.5 yuan, and Bujian and Kejian were not developed. The trend is still lackluster, with a decrease of 1-2 cents. The arrival of new Baiyuan is gradually connected, and it is also tired by half a point. The large market is 14.5 yuan, and the arrival and sales of Yinyuan are both weak, with high sales at 14 yuan.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai: Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived at the river. Sales in this street were dull and there were few transactions. Chang Group's new japonica rice saw a shortage of 3 cents, opening at 15.7 yuan. Sutong Group's Bai japonica rice has now fallen to 14.5 yuan, and there are few transactions. Nan Group's Qingjiao kiln-grown white rice is slightly scarce in supply, and customer sales are still weak. The market is similar to the previous day. Yangxian's special top opened at 11 yuan, and ordinary was only 0.45%. It is estimated to be around a small 2 cents. Dujian township sales have slightly increased, and the source is very abundant. The price fell by about 1 cent, and the high opening was 11.5 yuan. Jiaobai tip goods have withered, so the price has been honored. The opening price is 12.0 yuan. The Bianyuan return wind is very strong, and it has now fallen by 3 cents, opening at 15.2 yuan. The Yinyuan is also tired by 2 cents, and the market is extremely sluggish.</p>
<h3>The Starch Market Is Fraught with Peril</h3>
<p>▲Major Decline Slightly Recovered: Steady Outlook</p>
<p>Yesterday's starch market experienced a major turbulence during the opening session in the morning, as the price of foreign wheat fell by another 6-7 cents. With the gradual decline in spot wheat from foreign countries, the mentality of all parties has changed. Not only are the inland bulls extremely panicked, but also the factories are almost unanimously inclined to sell out. Due to the massive reverse sales by the bulls during the opening session, the market price plummeted and could not be salvaged. The lowest price for this month was 2.22 yuan, 2.18 yuan for November, 2.1975 yuan for December and January, 2.2075 yuan for February, and 2.215 yuan for March, a sharp drop of 3-4-5 points compared with the closing price of the previous day. However, after the second session, the bulls took the opportunity to replenish their positions due to the excessive decline, so the market also rebounded strongly. When the afternoon session opened, the market sentiment had become stable due to the major decline and small rebound, and there were not many ups and downs in each month. Looking at the steady outlook, there is really no reason to fall further to this point, and it should be temporarily circling. As a result, this month was down by 1.25 cents compared to the previous day, November and December were down by 1 cent, January and February were down by 0.25 cents, and March was unchanged.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Wheat Both Plummet Again</h3>
<p>▲The Decline in the Evening Market Comes to an End</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market saw the softness of the mentality reaching its peak after the opening session in the morning. Since foreign wheat has been ordered by factories, and the sale of spot wheat is also constantly on the way, the trend of wheat will of course be softened by foreign countries. Therefore, the bulls in the near and far terms have reached this environment and can no longer fight like trapped beasts. They can only take advantage of the trend to close out. Due to the competition among bulls, the market could not be salvaged. For example, the lowest price for November was 4.24 yuan, and the price for December was 4.22 yuan, which is similar to the standard of new wheat. The prices for January, February, and March also fell to 4.26 yuan, and it was seen that the situation was not good at that time, with the wheat not being worth much. When the afternoon session opened, the market rebounded slightly due to the slight recovery in the starch market and the competition among shorts. However, it was still slightly lower than the closing price of the previous day. As a result, October and November fell by 4 cents, December fell by 3 cents, and January, February, and March fell by 4 cents. The spot wheat market also saw a sharp decline, which was even worse in the middle and second grades. The lowest price was 4.00 yuan to enter customs, which was as low as 8 cents. It is said that more than 4,000 bags of wheat from Dongtai and Gaoyou were opened in the city's Guandian and handled by Xinda.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Goods, Tong'an Longan Market Prices Are Upside Down</h3>
<p>▲Land Prices Rise While Shanghai Prices Fall</p>
<p>Tong'an longan used to be promoted by special groups in the area of origin, and the market price rose by 2-3 yuan. Seeing that the market was turning active, the cargo owners successively loaded more than 1,000 pieces into Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the Mid-Autumn Festival here has just passed, and the appetite has become dull, so the trend has become softer day by day, and it has even fallen back. Some of the goods were opened the night before last, and the price was down by more than 1-2 yuan compared to the previous price. The second-grade goods were almost 2 yuan. It is said that there is hope for a turnaround in the market if sales activities increase.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Market Is Dumping Goods, and Dutch Sugar Sales Are Quite Active</h3>
<p>▲Japanese Sugar High-Grade Goods Are Scarce and Turn Upward</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market production area telex, the price of Cuban spot sugar was 1.34375, which was slightly higher than the previous telex by 0.0625. The price of New York sugar futures for December was 1.35, the price for March next year was 1.46, the price for May was 1.53, and there was no increase or decrease compared to the previous. The price for September was 1.66, a decrease of 0.01. The price of Java spot sugar was 8.125, the price of sugar futures for November was 8.00, and the price for December was 7.875, and there was still no rise or fall compared to the previous. The public association market was sluggish in trading. The price of Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse white sand was 7.925 yuan, and 7.90 yuan, and the high-grade goods were 8 yuan. Those who were newly arrived and could not ship the goods on the same day had a price of 7.80 yuan. The market was still stable. The price of No. 20 medium white sand was 7 yuan, and there were still few inquiries. The price of Japanese sugar YT mark was 7.75 yuan, the price of YRO mark was 7.45 yuan, and the price of TK mark was 7.8 yuan. The market shape was weak. The high-grade goods in the market were very thin. The price of J mark was 8.10 yuan, and the price of YP mark was 8 yuan, and the trend was quite good. The number plate had 50 packages of domestic yellow hill green opened, and the price was 7.3 yuan, which was a 1% decrease compared to the original plate, and the market was weak. Due to the strong interest of the firm in dumping Dutch sugar, the price has risen. The Tianxiang Foreign Firm opened 100 tons of Dutch red sugar No. 8 loaded in powder in November and December at a price of 4.85 Dutch yuan, and 100 tons of No. 10 at a price of 5.05 yuan, and there was also a saying of adding a price to chase it. The Fuji Foreign Firm opened 600 tons of Dutch red sugar No. 8 yesterday at a price of 4.875 yuan to 4.9 yuan, and the Huaxin Firm opened 200 tons of coarse white sand No. 24 loaded in early November at a price of 5.88 yuan, all new regulations plus tax, and the market atmosphere was good. The Shisha Luya had shipped 4,600 bags of coarse white sand and 8,400 bags of medium white sand of the arrived Dutch sugar, so the medium white sand market shape was weaker.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Shuang Gong Cocoon Prices Are Increasingly Strong</h3>
<p>▲Shuang Gong Silk Factory Works as Usual... The Demand for Raw Materials Is Still Smooth</p>
<p>There are already eight Shuang Gong silk factories in Shanghai, with more than 1,400 silk machines. Only two factories have stopped work, and the rest are working as usual. The demand for raw materials is still smooth, and the price of Shuang Gong cocoons is increasingly strong. Yesterday, Xinlun and other factories entered 380 loads of Shuang Gong cocoons from remote roads at a price of 47 yuan, which is estimated to be an increase of 2-3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Suian Zhenmei's English Sales Turn Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trade of Suian Zhenmei green tea was quite prosperous. The English-funded Xiehe Foreign Firm had a very strong interest due to the movement of the Russian Zhuang, and Jinlong Baochang and other firms also had a tendency to take advantage of the situation to start up. The market has slightly strengthened. The trade of Gongxi green tea is still not lonely, but the market for high-grade goods can still be firm, and the market for medium and low-grade goods is inevitable to look down. The Tongfu Foreign Firm has slightly entered the stomach of Qimen black tea, but the Russian Assistance Association thinks the market is too low, and the transaction has not yet been completed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth From This Factory With Coarse Twill, Northern Sales Gradually Active</h3>
<p>▲Eastern Goods, Fine Serge, Velvet, Continues to Rise</p>
<p>▲Cotton Cloth From This Factory: The market has been extremely chaotic recently. The coarse twill, which has been sluggish for a long time, has a sign of creeping, as the general situation in the north is gradually becoming calm. Yesterday, the Jin Group entered 150 pieces of Three Fish and Three Rabbit, and the Shan Group entered more than 200 pieces of Cat and Eagle, so the price was higher than before. The fine cloth that has been rising in price for a long time is gradually falling, and it has fallen by a thousand or so in the past week. The route of dyed blanks has been greatly reduced. The coarse cloth is the hardest in Hubei Tianzi, and it has been sold to 8.35 yuan. The spot goods of Lu Zi are also out of stock. The Anqing Datong and other ports of 13-pound cloth are slightly active, and the market for fine twill is still strong, and there seems to be no sign of falling for a while.</p>

The three companies of Sangong three horses all opened at 2.25 yuan yesterday. Printed velvet is very chaotic, and the price is from 2.3 yuan to 2.075 yuan. Western goods are still sluggish, and only the Fangli straight tribute cloth is selling daily, and the price is rising with the Eastern goods. Yesterday, it opened at 2.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Checked Waters Cloth Is Selling Well For A While</h3>
<p>Since the popularization of the checkered Waters cloth last year, most of the wool and flannel shops have been following up with foreign firms, because its market sales are active and there are profits to be made. Today, the spring sales are wider, and now the sales are even more prosperous. The two major groups in northern Sichuan and the small customer groups in the inland are all continuing to handle it. The woolen goods shops and Western clothing tailoring shops in Shanghai all have appetite. The current market price is 3.78 yuan per yard, the high-grade all-wool goods are 4.20 yuan, and the lower-grade goods are 3.45 yuan. However, these two kinds of goods have long been sold out in the market. Recently, the goods that need to be sold are all 3.78 yuan. It is heard that the Huashang Yongfeng Foreign Firm has recently arrived in Shanghai with about 80 boxes, and the opening price is 3.75 yuan, most of which are sold through Xianchang No. on Chessboard Street.

Now it has to be sold for 3.85 yuan.</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>▲The Dongyulun Silk and Satin Shop on Wangping Street, Nanjing Road, declares: "Our shop's aim is to serve society. Our selection of goods and pricing are unique and outstanding. Since opening, business has been thriving and our reputation has been growing. While honored, we dare not be complacent. We strive to serve and continuously improve, always focusing on quality and low prices, and always aiming for customer satisfaction. To reciprocate the patronage of all sectors, we will hold an autumn sale for 30 days starting October 12th. Every Sunday, we will also offer a complimentary genuine silk handkerchief."</p>
<p>▲The Huangjiuzhitang Pharmacy on Zhejiang Road declares: "Since our opening on August 16th, a full month has passed in the blink of an eye. Due to low prices and quality goods, our doors are crowded daily. Ginseng, bird's nest, fine medicines, and prepared slices and powders are all selling briskly. Among the pills and powders, Ginseng Rejuvenation Pills are particularly popular and are the top seller. During the first month of our opening, we offered a 30% discount to attract customers. Now that the first month is over, to continue to benefit our customers, we will continue to offer discounts. Our original plan was a 10% discount on weekdays and a 9.1% discount on the 1st, 15th, and Sundays. Now, during the continued discount period, we will offer a 9.1% discount every day. If the 1st, 15th, or a Sunday falls within this period, we will offer an additional 5% discount on top of the 9.1% discount, which is almost the same as the 30% discount offered during the first month of opening."</p>
<p>▲The Zhongqihua Company on Nanjing Road declares: "Our piece goods department has recently received a large shipment of fashionable women's overcoat velvet, all-wool men's and women's overcoat velvet, western-style suiting fabric, trendy patterned velvet, autumn overcoat wool, new patterned woolen crepe, window and door bunting, curtain fabric, new striped camel wool, patterned lining velvet, etc. During the current discount period, we are genuinely sacrificing profits and selling at cost. Customers are flocking to our store, demonstrating the low prices."</p>
<p>▲The Wangshuntai Woolen Fabric and Western Clothing Shop, opposite Lloyd Road on Nanjing Road, declares: "We have recently received a large shipment of unique patterned woolen fabrics, parti-colored bunting, and overcoat and robe materials, which have all arrived in succession. Therefore, starting yesterday, we are holding an autumn sale for 30 days. These goods are most suitable for making Western suits, with bright and beautiful colors and a unique aesthetic. Moreover, the prices are particularly low, so customers are flocking to order them, and business is very crowded."</p>
<p>▲The Liede'er Restaurant at 157-159 Avenue Dubail declares: "After several months of preparation, we are officially opening today. We offer exquisite Western cuisine at very reasonable prices. In the evenings, Western women will perform Western plays from 10:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning. In order to benefit Chinese ladies, there will be no admission fee."</p>
<p>▲The Taifeng Canned Food Company on Nanjing Road declares: "Our company has a long-standing reputation for snacks. A few months ago, we hired a Cantonese pastry chef who has special skills in snack preparation. Recently, this pastry chef has created three new types of pastries: lotus seed paste puff dumplings, red bean paste puff dumplings, and egg yolk puff balls. Their color, aroma, and taste are excellent and have a unique flavor. In recent days, these three products have been so popular that we can barely keep up with demand. The skillful cooking and the public's welcome are evident."</p>
<p>▲The Hanli Company declares: "Since our newly invented Zhongling Printing Machine was promoted by the Ministers of Education, Industry, Commerce, Railways, and Interior of Nanjing, people from all walks of life have recognized the importance of the machine and have been purchasing it in a continuous stream. Agents from various provinces and foreign countries have also been vying to place orders. Our company has also recently released a new edition of the Chinese Economical Telegraph Code. This book was compiled by Tan Rongguang, a famous scholar from Guangdong Province. The words and phrases are well-connected and all-encompassing. It has the same function as the Bentheny's English code, which is sold worldwide. Major commercial firms can use this code to transmit messages, saving two-thirds of their telegraph costs. The code uses a group of three English letters to represent a Chinese character, a company name, a place name, an idiom, or a secret agreement. Three groups are combined and an additional guarantee letter is added, making a total of ten letters per sentence. The telegraph office charges only one character's fee, but it can convey the meaning of three characters, achieving the effectiveness of dozens of characters. The code is particularly detailed in collecting information for the banking and shipping industries, and it is even more practical for overseas Chinese trade. Having this code is a great benefit for businesses, and it has been purchased by many. Our company's business in both areas has been very prosperous recently."</p>
<p>▲The Yongan Hosiery Factory declares: "Our owner has decades of experience and has built a Western-style market house on Dongmen Road outside Xiaodongmen, with a large clock embedded in the door for the convenience of pedestrians. The factory has purchased a wide range of machinery to produce various kinds of silk, yarn, and velvet socks. Among them, the economical socks are inexpensive and of good quality, and are very popular with the public. All purchases of one yuan or more will receive a full set of the Lingbo Qianying movie clips as a thank you for your patronage. The grand opening was on the 17th."</p>
<p>▲The Sino-French Clock and Watch Shop declares: "Yesterday was the first day of our grand opening, and patronage from all sectors was exceptionally enthusiastic because our prices are indeed fair. Many number 6 rectangular gold-filled watches were sold. The main distribution point is located at the French Concession Avenue Mash Street entrance to the automatic fire road."</p>
<p>▲The China Weiyi Woolen Fabric Factory declares: "Since establishing our main distribution point at 51 Niuzhuang Road, our business has greatly flourished because our Double Deer brand camel wool products are becoming increasingly refined and the patterns are even more novel. It is also convenient for customers to wholesale, and all ordered goods can be delivered daily, which is very convenient. Recently, we have been very busy and somewhat overwhelmed. Our newly installed telephone number is 17016."</p>
<p>▲The Yonghua Company Department Store, located at the intersection of Rue de Consulat and West Xinqiao Street, declares: "Our store specializes in selling various global goods and is organized with great care. As soon as our new building is completed, we will select an auspicious day for the grand opening."</p>

The film stars Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell and features a dramatic and moving storyline. Our theater has recently installed a new sound system that plays special music to accompany the film.

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Tour</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(14) Northern Mountain Temple Fair and Singing Girls</p>
<p>During the last three days of our trip, we happened to coincide with the date of the temple fair that the citizens of Jilin city were passionately gathering for, seemingly devoutly. (Probably the Buddha bathing festival, but I didn't inquire in detail, not knowing if the bodhisattva in the temple was a Buddha or a deity.) This was also the event that the students considered to be the most exciting.</p>
<p>It was indeed very lively. Rickshaws (i.e., Huang Bao cars), horse-drawn carriages, and crowds of people clogged the narrow roads, even though Northern Mountain was still far away.</p>
<p>Although Northern Mountain wasn't as desolate as a wilderness on ordinary days, visitors were always rare. However, during the temple fair, people were as crowded as ants gathering on a piece of food, packed on and off the mountain.</p>
<p>Well in advance, many merchants had set up market stalls from the foot of the mountain to the mountainside. Among these, the most numerous were teahouses selling cold and hot drinks, and every teahouse was filled with visitors.</p>
<p>We mixed into the crowd and climbed up the mountain.</p>
<p>These people, women, men, old, young… Among them, girls wearing fashionable clothes were in the minority (among this minority, most were prostitutes). From this, we can see that Jilin is still a simple and unsophisticated ancient city.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at a temple halfway up the mountain, it was filled with smoke, and I really couldn't get used to breathing inside. Most of the women who came to the mountain would come to the temple to burn incense and kowtow a few times, but most of the men came to watch the excitement, the so-called "strolling the temple fair," as we were doing.</p>
<p>There were also many amusement venues on and off the mountain: magic shows by Japanese and Koreans, stereoscopes (i.e., looking at picture slides), Peking opera stages, and teahouses where storytelling with drum accompaniment was performed. We found a teahouse with drum storytelling and went in to rest and relax.</p>
<p>I vaguely remember seeing drum storytelling once in Shanghai at the Great World or the Sun Sun Amusement Park. This time, I could truly experience the music and literature of the northern people, although I had no way of understanding what they were singing.</p>
<p>After a young singing girl finished performing, another young singing girl walked onto the stage. With one hand, she held three pieces of wood slightly apart, and with the other, she delicately held a chopstick. Bang, bang, bang, she began to strike the small drum and shake the clappers—bang, bang, bang, thump… Then, the old qin player with nearsighted eyes, wearing copper thimbles on his fingers, plucked the qin strings. Then, from between the singing girl's red lips and white teeth burst a vibrating and steady voice, like singing, but also like recounting.</p>
<p>When she struck the small drum for the first time, I almost jumped in surprise. This singing girl was perhaps different from the others, although she was probably even younger than them. But after that first forceful strike of the small drum, the old qin player seemed to pluck the qin strings even more energetically, and her singing voice was equally forceful, loud, and steady. She was able to quiet the clamor in the audience.</p>
<p>…Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang… This nervous singing girl's small drum was also nervous—thumping, thumping…</p>
<p>Lively, noisy, crowded, chaotic… All the way until the sun set in the west, and the colored clouds in the sky reflected on the mountain peak, turning into a golden glow, did the crowds on the mountain begin to thin out. Especially the women had to go home to prepare the evening meal.</p>
<p>We came when the incense began to burn in the incense burner, and only went back when the incense burner only emitted the smoke of remaining ashes.</p>
<h3>Autumn Rain Night</h3>
<p>— Shao Zhen</p>
<p>(Part 1)</p>
<p>Rong has indeed been very busy these past few months. Not to mention that the word "busy" has reduced his sleeping and eating time by a third, even the few sparse whiskers on his chin and around his lips, which have grown almost an inch long, have had no chance to be shaved. As soon as he gets out of bed in the morning, he takes a rickshaw to the office. He always comes home between seven and eight in the evening, rarely around six in the evening. Even on Sundays, he never sits at home for an hour. For lunch, he supposedly eats some snacks very casually, sometimes even without snacks, and waits until he gets home at night to eat two meals together, consuming two bowls of rice. After finishing dinner, he picks up his pen again and writes frantically on grid paper under the electric light. He never stops writing until two o'clock, and even when he stops, he smokes a cigarette while pondering the topic for the second night's writing. Sometimes, when he gets excited, he grabs the topic, picks up his pen, and writes until dawn. Perhaps he is exhausted and fatigued, so he drops the pen, yawns twice, and collapses onto the bed. Our sweet time after marriage has been wasted by him like this, which is really unfair. As for him, his already thin face has become even more sallow this past month. Fortunately, his spirits are still good. Although he is much thinner, his attitude remains as silent, gentle, and unexpressive of fatigue as usual. However, I always worry that if he continues to work like this, it will eventually cause great harm to his body. Every night, as usual, I repeatedly advise him to rest early and leave unfinished work for tomorrow. Unfortunately, Rong, who never listens to advice, completely ignores what I say as if it were mosquitoes buzzing in his ears. I have sulked because of his stubbornness, and I have also returned to my mother's house because of his stubbornness. But, ah, what good does this do us? Later, I simply joined him in his busyness. It can also be said that I always assist him from the side every night. However, I, who failed to finish my studies, what can I do to assist him? I only help him to transcribe his drafts. However, these things are already extremely strenuous for me.</p>
<p>What Rong writes at home every night is entirely about the literary and artistic movement of nationalism. There are novels, essays, and plays. Regarding the literary and artistic movement of nationalism, Rong once said to me:</p>
<p>"Judging from the current situation, the Chinese nation can be said to be numb to the extreme. To make them all understand the consciousness of the nation is not an easy thing in itself. But the mission borne by those in the nationalist literary movement is given by the times, to lead the entire Chinese nation through the current crisis, to avoid all kinds of suffering among the nations and to elevate the entire nation to a strong position. The mission is so great, the responsibility is also so great. Those in the nationalist literary movement cannot think that this is a very difficult work and fail to take on the mission and responsibility, or hesitate and dare not go forward. They should unite with comrades on the battle line, embrace a spirit of great selflessness, and strive forward. Their striving forward is certainly with a goal, which is to sacrifice themselves for the self-determination of the entire nation. Sacrifice, sacrifice, personal sacrifice, is not a shameful thing in itself, but it is necessary to estimate how much glory this sacrifice has in the nation. By inheritance, in tradition, every Chinese is determined to uphold a principle: to be beasts of burden for their descendants. Therefore, the harm it has caused is that, even now, the Chinese are still like a pile of loose sand, like in the previous century. The literary and artistic practitioners of nationalism, in spirit, in effort, in consciousness, of course, will extract and completely eliminate this evil thought from everyone's minds and replace it with a national consciousness. As for the efforts of this group of people, of course, they will expand their spirit of great fearlessness to seek welfare for the entire nation. Welfare, the welfare of the entire nation, in today's situation, is naturally in a very distant place, perhaps in a place they want to get to but cannot see. But 'doing it is not difficult, just keep striving forward, and that place will be easily reached.' Therefore, they knew and saw that there was a crisis at hand and did not think it was a crisis. It was precisely because they knew and saw that there was a crisis at hand that they wanted to wade through the crisis for the future self-determination of the entire nation. From that day on, they shouted and stepped towards this crisis. Their stepping towards this crisis was to trample it into a broad and smooth road for the entire nation following behind to walk on safely. This is the center of their group's efforts. Now, they have already stepped on it, and they have already flattened half of this crisis. Since their work began, although their entire success, so to speak, is not today but in the future, they have already sown many seeds of national consciousness among the nation. This is truly the vitality of the entire Chinese nation, and it is truly the most fortunate thing for the entire Chinese nation.</p>
<p>"Speaking of literature and art again, it was originally produced from the state of consciousness formed on the national standpoint. There is no literature and art that can be produced without this. Unfortunately, China has had this kind of so-called literature and art, which has led to Chinese literature and art entering such a decadent period today. Necessarily, it has become the current crisis facing the entire Chinese nation today. The reason for this is that thought has lost its center, and culture has no way out. What is the center of thought, and what is the way out for culture? In a word, nationalism only. (To be continued)"</p>
