<p>能識世界大勢之各國。皆知今日强盛之國之不能長恃。故咸預謀所以收束之方。商業衰落之勢。一時不能挽回則惟有减省其國用。國有最大之支出。爲軍備。而軍備之中。尤以海軍爲甚。假使各海軍國而競爭造艦。如歐戰以前者。則非特商業衰落之今日。難以應付。即商業不衰落。亦必因此而互至財政之困窮。故今日各强國之海軍縮减會議。非眞去戰而弭兵也。蓋各欲自脱日後經濟上之危險也。故今日縮减軍備之舉。視歐戰以前。較有誠意。無他。迫於世界大勢。而無可如何耳。</p>
<p>雖然縮减軍備。雖可稍稍成功而即認爲藉此可以消弭戰禍。則又非是。何也。自商業日就衰落之後。受經濟壓迫者日衆。原受者方思擺脱。將受者日謀方法以加重壓迫於人。人與人國與國之爭端。日益加急。如是而和平之想。其可得耶。即有先覺之人。大聲疾呼。以求調洽。而一則以實情之相逼。一則以新思與舊習慣之不能相容。又不能强去其一。是以和平之望終不能見於今後。雖有軍縮協議之成功。亦無補也。</p>

<p>▲吳稚暉報告時局感想</p>
<p>中央宣傳部十七日下午二時、在中央第二會議廳招待新聞界、到有本京及滬漢平津各地駐京記者約二十餘人、劉蘆隱主席、行禮開會後、介紹中央監察委員吳稚暉作下列之報告、</p>
<p>「連日忙碌、未暇注意所謂時局問題、僅就個人數日以來所感想到的、貢獻給各位、以博一笑、現在又閙到軍政時期了、這樣時期、何以又閙出來、據兄弟一人之感想、略述一二、當去年冬季到北方時、絶不知道還會有什麽軍事、因爲閻錫山這個人是不會有什麽野心的、至於一人割據、或亦可加原諒、因爲他自己旣想施展其手腕、顯弄其本領、亦須要有一個地方供他試騐照過去的山西情形看來、他的樣子、像是小心謹愼、有一點政治興味、以一個地方來供他試騐也算很好、但是以後我到了北方、見其諸事暗中播弄、中央畀以冀察綏各省政治責任、於是他自己也以爲山西一省不足展其所長、野心遂即生出來了、一方面説、他是在割據地盤、另一方面説、亦可謂爲北門鎖鑰他如果是不搗亂、將北方數省交給他、也没有什麽了不得、他如眞能作一北門鎖鑰、已經是很够他辛苦了、所以他的言論很覺滿足、如果大家相任、就算過去了、就事實現狀而論、不論那一方面、當擔子還未挑起來的時候、覺得自己很有把握、一旦挑起來了、更很不滿意、旣是公然的出來敵對、當然要在舞臺掀幾個觔半、如是必然弄到什麽狼藉不堪收拾、如此的試騐下去、到底那一天會了、須知人民有時也會不給他們試騐了、况且現在一切没有辦法、打仗也没有工夫、像馮煥章還在陜西唱戲、實際上陜西省連草也没有了、那一個是的確救國救民的、那一個不是戴着假面具、如此的連續不停下去、我們實在不敢下一個天經地義的斷語、也實在</p>
<p>是作不到、最好是他們自身能有覺悟、過去一切的醜、彼此都不必説了、大家能够滿足一點就好了、中國人民愛好和平、到時他們也會起來説革命把我們的命都革掉了、請你們歇一歇吧、去年兄弟曾將此意告閣、他和趙次隴先生皆很贊成、至今趙先生所以有點不好意思、自抱消極、我們最不明白的、是現在這種不死不活的狀態、日本人的把戲、有時助甲反乙、甲將成功、則又用丙反甲、丙如能成、又以一人反丙、總是不願使人成功、旣有力量、本可一决勝負、而乃計不出此、於是成了現在的北方情形、自從本黨北伐統一之後、我們所見到的、使要人集合到中央來、使中央成爲大家的中央、如是局面、可告安定、故北平湯山一會之後、各要人齊集南京、均有誠意、共謀和平、但是馮煥章在勵志社内大映其西北軍的影片、示其威武、殊背和平之道、由是弄成了「兩大」的原則、你看不起我、我看不起你即是居心如此似乎也不應拿出這些影片來、使人知其用意所在、不到幾時、大家便感到不舒服於是去年正月馮煥章便走了、有此一走、便是不想合作、再進而跑到了刀兵相見的地方、廣西各位也没有什麽了不得、試問現在大家來謀建設了還要兵作什麽、他們所以還是要兵的意思、中國有幾句話、「宮室之美、妻妾之奉、所識窮乏者得我、」因爲所識窮乏者得我、故不肯將兵裁掉、統率一天便算一天、不幸廣西諸位發生了驅走湖南主席魯滌平一事、當時胡宗鐸陶鈞等氣𦦨甚張、不肯認錯、繼而乃至開火、馮煥章先�</p>
<p>與桂系確是有些花樣、到了那時馮反在旁坐視、及至李宗仁等敗了、面孫良誠也離開山東了、西北軍退後、而張發奎又起來了、張在鄂時、西北没有浮動、而張到了湖南、宋哲元石敬亭等又出來了、這些好似在開玩笑一樣、簡直是同人民來開玩笑、這種造反方式、太不高明、一點目的也没有於、此我們不免歎一口氣、閻百川現在也想來試一試、謀踞最高地位、其實最高地位、是怎樣的辦法、他一點也不懂、先前看過的是徐世昌一套把戲、他想先來開門看一看、如果東也没有什麽、西也没有什麽、兩邊文武排列好了、等到你們没有辦法了、他便可以搖掏擺擺出來坐上龍位、豈非滑稽可笑之至、梁卓如有一句話中國有人才太不經濟、實有不錯、閻錫山祇能作一省的長官、馮煥章祇能作一個循吏、然而他們都不好好去做、總想打仗、心裏總是想作一個老大、而轉來轉去、還是一個老二、至於老大是如何作法、他們是全不懂的、這便是人才的不經濟、」</p>

<p>▲擊斃匪首三名匪徒三百餘</p>
<p>湖州通信、湖屬股匪爲患、年來猖獗日甚、尤以長興一帶爲害最烈、大有遍地萑苻之槪、自去冬太湖股匪被剿竄長後、該項股匪、即與安徽鮑剛殘部及大刀會結合、因之氣燄更張、洗刦村落與擄人勒贖之案、幾無日無之旬日以來、先後將長興胥倉下源渡港口等十餘處保衞團槍械繳去、復當衆揚言、有定期進攻何城何鎭之説、本月十四日、長興泗安與林城橋交界間之長橋卡地方、忽有股匪五千飶人集合進窺重鎭、匪勢險惡、駐防附近之國軍五師三十團一三兩營及保安隊水警等得訊後、即佈防進剿、無如衆寡懸殊、股匪二千餘、竟於十五日上午八時將長興商業重心之泗安鎭佔據、後經軍警奮勇進剿、至十六日上午八時始奘將泗安克復茲將所得息彙誌如次、</p>

<p>▲進犯泗安　泗安爲長興縣屬之商業重心、年來努力建設、市政頗爲可觀、交通亦稱便利、乘汽輪六小時可達吳興、且此處爲米穀出産之區、商賈絡繹於道、終年不絶、故尤爲匪徒所垂涎、十四日有股匪數千人、集合於離鎭二十里之長橋卡地方、迨至國軍曁保安隊派兵進剿、是項股匪即向泗安退走、鎭中兵力單薄、抵禦無效、卒於十五日上午八時爲匪所佔、</p>

<p>▲越南國民黨活動</p>
<p>▲二月十日之事變</p>
<p>今年爲法國佔領亞耳日爾之百年紀念、巴黎及北非殖民地、舉行祝典、極一時之盛、法國向海外拓植、歷時不過百年、其初向美洲及北非方面發展、浸假而植其勢力於極東、一八八五年中法戰後以安南爲其保護國、一九九八年復以廣州灣爲其租借地、大戰以後、法國復獲得戰前德國殖民地之一部分、於是法國遂成爲世界最大殖民帝國之一、其海外屬地之廣大、僅次於英國、此次倫敦會議、法國要求龐大之海軍艦隊、正以維持其毋國與屬地間之聯絡、同時政府之謀猷、國會之建議、均注意於向海外擴張、蓋今日之法蘭西、旣成爲世界的殖民大國、則其戰後新興的大工商業、過分膨脹的金融資本、自非從海外尋求出路不可矣、</p>
<p>然殖民國、不能不以武力爲其維持之基礎、而各地民族、每以被壓迫爲慮、易生反抗之心、今年印度獨立運動、再接再厲、甘地之平和革命、頗與英政府之殖民政策以不利、同時久無聲息之越南民族、亦揭午竿謀叛、法政府亦不能不重視之、從可知東方民族之獨立運動、雖暫寂靜、暗中實未嘗息滅也、</p>
<p>此次越南獨立黨人之謀叛、參加人數、並不衆多、且未及一盡夜而即告平息、法國朝野、雖甚鎭定、然觀於國會中之嚴重責問、及事後之種種處置、則其内情之重大、固不難推測而得、蓋此次事變、雖起於倉卒、然其蘊釀、則非一日、自一年以來、安南民族獨立運動、已逐漸活躍、去年一年中、安南政治犯之被拘捕者、時有所聞、先是、安南民族運動者、有越南國民黨之組織、自去年春間、即秘密活動、、</p>
<p>參加者大多爲靑年學生及工人、當時其領袖阮某、被政府捕獲、處以三年之監禁、同時黨人被捕者、則有一百五十人、去年五六月、法當局曾搜檢越南各書舖及報紙編輯機關一次、越南師範學校學生、因罷課風潮、亦被捕去學生多人、七月三日越南刑法委員會、判决安南人二十五名以十五年十年五年之苦役、其中被監禁者、有婦女數名、八月五日有安南黨人全家被捕下獄、九月一日、黨人阮房炎（？）自經於獄中、雖經政府嚴厲取締、而越南國民黨、仍積極活動、最後乃有本年二月十日之流血慘變、</p>
<p>二月十日之變、係在楊貝（？）洪河（？）（以上地名係法文名之音譯、手頭無中文辭書可查、故照音譯）河内三處同時發動、其事變之起源及經過情形、現在尙不能明瞭、以下所述、則係根據法國官廳方面之報告、</p>
<p>楊貝·洪河·河内、均在東京省、均爲滇越鐵路所經過之要鎭、河内則爲東京省之首府、楊貝距我國邊境之老開塞僅二百里、數小時可達蒙自、先時越南國民黨人秘密運動、駐在楊貝之東京士兵、於淸晨一時起事、叛軍約五十餘人襲擊法國軍官之住宅、並佔領軍械庫、法國軍隊未及預防、幾不能抵抗、直至天明、法軍始搜集殘部、向叛軍圍攻、未幾秩序、即完全恢復、革命軍死二十餘人、被俘二十五人、僅三人脱逃、此外安南平民被捕者多人、是役中法軍死軍官五人、傷二人、</p>

<p>▲主席報告　主席潘公展致開會辭、略謂、各位同志、今天我們上海各界代表、到這兒來舉行慶祝國府建都南京三週年紀念、同時還要把現在反動的軍閥閻錫山等、所有反動的行爲、擇要列舉、促起大家的注意、來共同聲討、我們在這一次來紀念國民政府的建都南京、尤其在現在的這種環境中、在反動的軍閥政客們、想在北平設立僞政府的時候、我們來紀念三年前國民政府、在總理指定的地方建都、確是有格外重大的意義、格外要大家互相勉勵、鞏固革命勢力的基礎、努力撲滅反動勢力、在北平設立僞政府的陰謀、我們知道、惟有南京、在歷史上地理上文化上方有配做新中國的首都的資格、總理生前、所以指定南京爲首都的意思、擇要言之、可以舉出二點、第一點、南京在中國歷史上文化上看起來、很可以代表中國的新生機、可以代表中國民族復興的精神、可以指示中國革命運動的發展、在歷史上去找、與南京發生的民族運動、遠的不說、單說幾十年前的太平天國、也就是說本黨所努力的國民革命的前驅、太平天國的行動雖然不過是狹義的民族主義、但是經濟上政治上也都有相當的改革、尤其是在民族主義的立足點、提倡中國民族的復興、使得我們注意他們就是以南京爲政治中心的、再回想到五六百年前、我們在蒙古人統洽之下受着劇烈的壓迫、漢族復興運動的成功、也是建都在南京、這種民族復興的歷史、往往以南京爲代表、是不容抹殺、也不容誰來否認的、爲什麽南京成爲民族復興勢力的代表呢、自有他的原因在、因爲時代和文化、都是推演前進的、到了新舊勢力的鬥爭時期、一方代表舊勢力、一方代表新勢力、而舊勢力的中心、都在北平、就是從前的北京、新勢力的中心、是在南京、總理所以指定南京爲首都者、就是要大家擁護新的主義新的勢力、來打倒陳舊的惡濁的封建的勢力、使新中國的建設、可以順利進行、第二點、我們應當明白、滿淸末年以至袁世凱一系北洋軍閥當權以來、種種國際交涉的失敗、造成了駕乎中國軍閥政府以上的太上政府、這就是北京東交民巷的所謂公使團、本來一個國家對外的交涉、例如中日間的問題祇須中日兩國直接交涉、中英間的問題、祇須中英兩國直接交涉、這是一定的道理、中國則不然、你要向一國交涉但因爲帝國主義者、組織了聯合戰線、把不平等條約來束縛我、對於中國的問題、中國要向一國交涉時、他們必定聯合起來、成了連鷄之勢、所謂的公使團、所謂辛丑和約的各國公使團、向來挾持中國的北平政府慣的、我們要廢約、他們偏說修約、北方軍閥政府至覆亡時爲止、連修約也一黠没有做到、所以爲此點、就是因爲顧忌太上政府的緣故、如我們的政府、還是設在北平、這種帝國主義者勢力支配之下、這種連鷄之勢、是打不破的、新的希望、也簡直可以說没有、只要看現在閻錫山等、想在北平設立僞政府、却先要派人向東交民巷公使團疏通、也就可想而知、他們是投降了帝國主義者、所以國民政府在南京建都、乃是外交的曙光、南京政府成立三年以來、所辦外交、縱或有不能盡滿人意之處、但就不受公使團的脅制一層來說、外交上的第一部的勝利已得了、從這一層看來、國民政府的外交行動、受了建都南京的好影響、故總理指定首都在南京、就是脫離帝國主義的挾制、對内說、我們要剷除陳腐的勢力、惡濁的勢力封建的勢力、要建設新的中國、開發民族的生機、是非建都南京不可的、對外說、要脫離公使團的脅迫、要打破帝國主義的牽制、要建設革命外交的政府、也是非建都南京不可的、總理的指定首都、如呌研究文化研究史地的學者來講、他們一定有許多理論來擁護總理指定南京的主張、單就上面這兩點看來、已可以知道總理指定南京建都的意義、是何等重大、確乎絶對不可以違背的了、如果還有人主張在北平設立起政府來、不管主張的是什麽人、都是毫無疑義的反動者、也就是心目中不要新的發展、不要中國民族的復興、更就是舊思想舊勢力的復辟、閻錫山馮玉祥、本來大家都曉得、他們是封建餘孽的軍閥、是只注意着個人的權利和地盤、現在他們陰謀、在北平組織政府、我們祇有很可憐的他們的愚蠢、只是還有許多嘴上還在說黨還在說總理的改組派和西山會議派、他爲了自私自利之故、投奔了軍閥卵翼之下、想在北平設起僞政府來、他們還可以說不是反革命嗎、還可以不聲討嗎、這就是今天紀念的意義中最要緊的第一點、第二點、我們再想想國民政府爲什麽要遷都南京、當黨軍克復湘鄂武漢、南京未下之際、國府爲策應政治軍事的指揮、不得不遷到長江流域、當時政治軍事、正在發展的時候、不幸那些共産黨、本以個人資格加入本黨的、竟要簒竊本黨荼毒中國了、本黨一面要對付軍閥、一面要實行淸黨一、一面要救中國、一面更要救黨於是實行淸黨、並遷都南京、所以第一點、我們想到國府建都南京、不仍是尊崇總理的意思、且有保護本黨生命國家生機的意義、這是紀念的第一點意思、今天的紀念、每年要有一次、今天是第三次了、我們爲什麽要有這第三次的紀念呢、這就是要我們把過去三年的工作、檢閲一下、是否各事都已經成功、有那幾件事、進步得快、有那幾件事、進步得慢、有那幾件事、還没有進步、國民黨的革命運動、永遠是向前的、但是並不是說國民黨第一次代表大會的政綱、定下了之後、立刻就會完成、這是誰何都辦不到的、有些人以爲革命、應當像變戲法一樣、一變就成、這眞是笑話、他們有了這種錯覺就指摘出一二點、造出許多淺薄的謬說、於是意志薄弱的人、受其煽惑、不期而向反革命之途、現在這些反動份子、除了軍閥外、其他都不免出發於這種錯誤觀念、殊不知以中國土地之廣、人口之衆、要革命完成、祇有靠本黨忠實的領袖們、秉承總理的遺敎、領導全黨的同志、全國的同胞、在三民主義下、先做和平統一的工作、把中國在新勢力之下、穩定起來、建設起來、以共信互信爲基礎、大家認定宗旨不錯、動機不誤、就要熱心去辦事、忠恕去待人、我們可以用本黨的主義政綱、作權衡尺度、來檢閲過往的工作、今天進了幾寸、明天進了幾尺了、也决没有一天馬到成功的理、也决不能因爲不能眼看黃金世界的湧現、就謾駡就憤激、就灰心就浪漫、靑年同志、應該注意修養自己的身心意志、根據總理的遺志、各自勉勵、做一分是一分、見到足以危害我民族國家的生存的學說和活動、就要毫不客氣的來撲滅他、見到足以危害黨國基礎的叛逆份子、就要擁護中央來打倒他這才是同志的態度、這才是國民的責任、這是今天紀念的第三個意義、總之、第一遷都南京、是根據總理的遺敎、第二遷都南京、是爲的救黨救國、第三紀念遷都南京、是要以忠恕之道來檢閲政府的工作、擁護政府的討伐叛逆、於此我們就知道閻馮以及改組派西山會議派等反動份子的行動、完全是不要黨、不要國家、違背總理的遺敎、想恢復舊惡勢力、是新中國的罪人、所以今天到會的各界代表、大家見了朋友親戚、要把這個意思去轉輾告訴、讓他都明白得閻馮叛逆行爲的不是、與我們應取的態度、才算是我們眞正紀念了國府的建都南京、次有市黨部陳光虞、演說從略、</p>

<p>京市敎育局與市立各學校决定二十日在五泥公園與邵範歡迎全敎</p>
<h3 id="c153">讀師資訓練方案（一）　（異） <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>國内中師合校制、創之者爲浙江、繼之者有江蘇、在首次全國敎育會議中、對此問題、即發生嚴重之討論主張師範應獨立辦理者、有兩廣敎育廳、國立中山大學、京市敎育局中央大學區師範科聯合會、及專家莊澤宣程柏廬等等、經數次精密之討論結束爭得「爲促成義務敎衣起見應於高中師範科外、由各省多設獨立之師範學校」一條補救辦法、茲讀本届師資方案、已明文規定凡省内師範學校、已經併入高中者、在可能範圍内酌量地方情形、並得令逐漸分立、各方意見之傾向師範獨立、彰彰明矣、在事實上中師合而復分、誠多時間性的枝節問題敎育當局有顧忌此點、而發生反對之論調者竊以敎育方案、爲百年根本大計、决不能以此而犧牲永久價値、因噎廢食、是烏乎可</p>
<h3 id="c154">敎育方案讀後感　莊澤宣 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>此次全國敎育會議、正待討論的方案、雖曾在各處片段的看見過、但整個的却直到前天抵京後才拜讀一過、裏面計劃詳明篇幅繁多、當然非短少時間怱怱看過所可亂談、不過連日申報催促作稿、爰就一時感到、來胡談一下、</p>
<p>關於義務民衆初等敎育各方面、我已應首都中央日報之徵、作了一篇「論中國强迫敎育應從十歲起、」（見十二號該報全國敎育會議特刋第一號）發表了一些意見、現在姑且不談、</p>
<p>關於中等敎育這一段、本來是最難編製的、中等敎育無論是在古今中外都是最難辦的、因爲内容是最複雜的、但是我常聽見人說、一國的富强全靠中等人才的優劣、所以我覺得今後我國敎育界在這一方面、不可不特加注意、此次中等敎育計劃、似仍着重升學方面而忽視職業方面、本來職業敎育在現在的中國是很不容易辦的、不過我以爲今後中國建設、必需善用職業敎育爲促進的工具、這個意思在開會的時候蔣孔兩部長都隱約提及、却没有提出具體的辦法、方案裏對於這一點、似乎也少注意到、這或者是因爲此次會議須集中於幾個大問題的緣故、我希望萬一此次會議不及討論到此、敎育部能連合建設委員會農礦工商鐵道交通各部、並加入若干實業與敎育專家、開一聯席會議、專討論這個問題、庶乎不但學生有去路、經費有來源、而且心�</p>
<p>理與物質能同時建設起來、</p>
<p>關於高等敎育的整理、我認爲非常重要、我本相加入高等敎育組、貢獻一點意見、但到會後看見加入的人數已經很多、所以未果、我以爲升學的高中應受各處高等敎育機關監督、派人參與這種高中畢業考試、方能提高與劃一人學程度、最好各大學、｜尤其是國立的｜能仿美國辦法、設一聯合招考委員會、經這種考試委員會考及格的可入任何大學並可自由轉學、然後各大學可各專所長、除幾個基本學系外、不心普遍設立、而可集中於幾系的發展、這一點我認爲在今日中國人才經費兩難的時代是極重要的、否則大學雖多而無一所長、總是這幾個人拉來拉去這是一般辦大學的所最感痛苦的、當然有的學系需要較多、可在全國設三四個、有的全國設一個兩個便可、把節省下來的經費多加設備增高薪水、庶乎學術可以提高而獨立、我希望�</p>
<p>敎育部能在此次會議完畢後召集一大學行政會議、解决這個和其他連帶的問題、</p>
<p>最後關於禮育的問題、似乎這個方案裏也忽視一點、這也許是因爲要集中討論幾個問題的緣故、這次全國運動會成續固然很好、裏想在遠東運動會占一席已不容易、何况選手運動祇是一種刺激、不是根本提倡體育的辦法、我以爲至少一個中學畢業生、應達到某種體育標準、一個大學畢業生、應該達到更高的標準、（這是我們已經决定在廣州中山大學、實行的辦法、）對於體育師資的養成、應特别注意、這幾點似乎都可以在方案中提到的、</p>
<p>我的感想的總結、就是昨天我們的代表金湘帆先生在答辭中的話、我們此次會議是實現上次會議决定的三民主義敎育、對於民族民生民權的敎育應整個的系統的前進、（四月十六號在首都）</p>
<h3 id="c155">方案提要　（三） <a href="#c155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>

<h3 id="c165">蔣主席訓詞 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>三民主義是童軍根本信條</p>
<p>訓練目標要造成獨立人格</p>
<p>應摒除浪漫浮躁頽詐惡習</p>
<p>勿爲卑汚苟且心理所蒙蔽</p>
<p>表演成績充實精神的修養</p>
<p>蔣主席對中國童子軍、昨日蒞塲致訓、其詞曰、中國的童子軍、自創辦以來已有十幾年的歷史、在過去也曾表現了相當良好的成績、处從歸屬本黨指導以後、有了中心的信仰、統一的組織、切實的訓練、比較從前又更有進步了即就人數而論、此次參加檢閲的已有幾千人之多若與英美等國相比較、固然遠不相及、但是由此也可以證明中國的童子軍確實已在發達的過程中了、此次全國童子軍的第一次總檢閲、實爲中國童子軍開一新紀元、也可算是中國空前的盛舉、本席參加此次總檢閲、心中非常欣快、而且同時懷著無限的希望、</p>
<p>大家都知道童子軍是以智仁勇爲根本精神的、但是這種根本精神必須有一個最高原則、方能有所依據、必須有一種最大使命、方得有所歸宿、中國的童子軍旣名爲黨童子軍、可知他的最高原則、便是三民主義、他的最大使命、便是實現三民主義、三民主義、是救國救民救世界的主義、實現三民主義、便是實現這救國救民救世界的人類的最大使命、所以中國的童子軍是要在三民主義的信仰之下培養發揮智仁勇的精神、這就是我們中國童子軍的一個根本信條、能够遵守這個信條的、才配爲中國的童子軍、才配稱爲黨童子軍、</p>
<p>二十世紀的人類、應當個個都是社會人都是獨立人、人若孤立獨行、脫離社會、就不能維持他的生存、人若倚頼他人、寄生社會、也不能長久維持他的生存、能以自己的力量料理自己的生活便是獨立人、能盡自己的力量去替社會服務、便是社會人、的怪童子軍的訓練的目標、便是要造成獨立人與社會人的資格、　如救護、通訉、追踪、禮節、等訓練、便是服務社會的訓練又如洗滌、縫補、炊事、便是以自己的力量料理自己的生活的技術、這些訓練若能純熟、久而久之、自然就是可以成爲一種有獨立精神的社會人了而其中最重要的、便是團結生活的精神、假如每一個童子軍的團員若離開他的團體、他便喪失他的作用同時他的團體、也便减少一分力量、所以童子軍的團體生活、是有機性的、是異常緊密的、人類社會若能達到這種墳界、是一定非常發達而進步的、童子軍的訓練、便是要將這種分工嚴密的團體生活的精神、擴充到社會生活上去、使社會成爲一種有機的緊密的社會、本黨總理曾經說過、人亦賦有多少天生合羣的性質、但須加以訓練、然後合羣的性質才有進步、這便是童子軍訓練的一個最重要的目標、</p>
<p>中國革命的目的是要建設一個三民主義的社會、三民主義的社會是有組織有紀律的嚴格的社會、不是自由散漫的社會、但是中國人的散漫廢弛、已達極點、若非加以嚴格的訓練、這種有組織有紀律的三民主義的社會、决不能够實現、過去時代的人、已經是難於矯正了、靑年是將來國家的主人、社會的中堅、所以中國唯一的希望、就在靑年、但是現在中國的靑年、因爲社會環境不良、大多數流於浪漫·浮躁·頽廢·狡詐·只知個人的自由、不守團體的紀律、任情放縱、不顧一切、此種現象、若長此放任、中國的將來只有亡國滅種的一條死路、所以在這種革命的過渡時代、童子軍尤爲一種急切需要的組織、現在加入童子軍的、都是十二歲以上的靑年、距成年時期不遠、在這期間内若能受着充分的嚴格訓練、將來成年後一定可以成爲新社會的中堅、所以建設三民主義社會的責任、便在我們童子軍的各個團員的肩上、因此每一個童子軍的團員、都應當竭力掃除一切浪漫浮躁頽廢狡詐等惡習、養成尊重團體服從紀律的精神、遵守總理所說的「只的團體有自由、個人没有自由」的遺訓、造成一個模範的中國靑年、</p>
<p>在革命過程中、黨童子軍的使命、較之各國的童子軍特别重大、他的性質可說是一種革命隊伍的預備軍、他的使命是在完成國民革命的大事業、每一個團員、就是靑年的革命戰士、他的思想要純正、勿爲三民主義以外的邪說所動搖動機要純潔、勿爲一切卑汚苟且的心理所蒙蔽、要有自强自立的精神、忍苦耐勞的毅力、勿務外表的虚華、應求内心的充實、心如此才配稱爲一個革命靑年、也必如此才能担當艱難巨大的責任、心須每個團員都能訓練到這種程度、然後童子軍的使命才算已經完成、</p>
<p>現在中國的童子軍、因爲經費及其他種種困難情形、僅限於學校中一部份學生、但是將來必須設法擴充發達、不僅學校的學生、就是學校以外社會上一般民衆的靑年、也應當使其有加入的機會然後訓練才能够普遍、效果才能够偉大、這是本席對於主持辦理童子軍執事人的一個希望、</p>
<p>本席今日參加此次總檢閲　比檢閲軍隊更爲高興、因爲本席看到這幾千天眞活潑的靑年無異有幾千縷的希望擺在我的面前、所以心中非常感動而且非常欣慰、希望此次檢閲的結果如發見有何種缺點、即當設法竭力改善若到第二次檢閲時團員對於主義的信仰、能够更加深切、服務表演的成績、能够更加進步、精神的修養、能够更加充實、則中國的前途就有無窮希望了、最後敬祝中國童子軍萬歲、</p>

<p>▲童子軍鹿各平奮鬥</p>
<p>▲自己保護自己民族</p>
<p>兄弟今天看到全國童子軍大集合、回想從前到英國不識英文、其時遇先總理見一童子軍、總理說這是ＢｏｙｆＳｃｏｕｔｙｈｔ、後來到蘇格來時、我說這是蘇格來的國民、總理發明的中山裝、就是童子軍的衣服、目的要化老人爲童子軍、穿了武裝、乃謀一種集合團體的便利、要和平·奮鬥·救中國、是總理革命宗旨、中國童子軍、就應用和平奮鬥使中國民族主義實施出來、童子軍任何事均由自己管理、世界任何事尙能童子軍化自己保護自己民族、促成世界大同、此是諸位的責任、諸位應將中國人集合起來、用勸導奮鬥法、照總理所說和平救中國的目的達到、消滅國内一切反動軍閥、這是我祝中國童子軍一百個萬萬歲的一點小小意思、</p>

<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>頃據外報通信。言美國駐公使詹生之軼事殊詳。原作者久居北平。與詹生爲至友。所言當不爲虚。爰爲譯述之如次。</p>
<p>▲黃包車癖　詹生在中國。喜坐黃包車。而不願坐摩托卡在北平爲尤甚。除平日有緊急公務偶驾汽車以行外。其他如赴宴會或閒游之時。則一輛黃包車爲極不可少者。詹生嘗語人曰。坐汽車觀風景。如走馬看花。了無樂趣。不若雇一人力車。緩步而行。較爲適宜也。又詹生每雇黃包車。對於車夫亦極有禮貎。給付車資。常倍於他人。途中又喜與車夫刺刺作閒談。不以官吏自尊也。北平東交民巷一帶之車夫。無有不識詹生者然其中固極少有知其爲駐華之美國公使者也。</p>
<p>▲喜用黑領結　北平各種宴會。凡遇公使館之領袖列席者。來客均須一律穿晚禮服。而詹生則頗不慣爲此。常用黑領結御一常服而往。平日遇公使館中人。亦時以此爲言。竭力提倡黑領結主義。若遇某夕有宴會而必須御大禮服者。詹生常於半途要友人。卸去大禮服。而換以同樣之服裝。以便羣客畢集時。見詹生而不致稱怪也。</p>
<p>▲哈德門香烟癖　詹生更有一特别之嗜好。即其平日不吸捲烟則已。若吸捲烟則非吸哈德門香烟不可。哈德門爲一中等之烟草。價極賤。爲一般苦力所吸者。而詹生乃嗜之成癖。亦可怪也。詹生此次重行來華。嘗語華友曰。中國爲余之第二母國。余此次來華。中心極覺愉快。而愉快之原因。其一即得再嘗哈德門之滋味。因哈德門香烟。僅銷售於中國。在美國則無從購置也。有人爲詹生解釋其哈德門癖之理由者。謂詹生昔在中國爲學生翻譯時。嘗吸哈德門香烟。因以成癮。後此重吸此烟覺其味仍如昔。遂不禁嗜之成癖矣。</p>

<p>— 筑鳴</p>
<p>遊園以晴爲佳。然雨後園林。則咀嚼轉饒餘味。四月十二日。予參與靑年會所發起葉園之游。是日碧天劣晴。亂雲欲雨。而游衆興不稍衰。午炊後。以汽車往。洎抵江灣。雨脚已如線。到園之頃。雨乃如潮。客皆覓亭館遮雨。於霏珠跳玉間。有一石一花。一橋一柳。皆饒畫趣。其耐人尋味處。轉不在初日樓臺向陽池榭間也。二時過半。集游客於園東隅草地上。由靑年會主者致詞。繼以友聲旅行團國樂。予特遠引至隔牆水次聽之。風過聲來。不殊聽洞簫聲於竹間月下。樂止爲某君舞劍。殿以攝影。一時裙屐蹁躚。笑言　作。令人忘却中原戰鼓聲矣。葉園之勝。予以爲在橋陰水際。幾樹垂楊。柳下波間。數石偃臥。游人倘褰裳涉流。小立碧波深處。則小橋罨陰。湖光亂柳。盈盈一水間。當覺凉綠畫人。殘紅過屐。去秋游留園時。曾見吳中美術家。畫老樹橫柯矮牆亂石。於黿頭渚。亦見人畫平波遠樹綠岫風帆。然此間風物。不數吳下梁谿。當付與春江老畫師。母令慘綠少年懷中開麥拉笑人也。歸途有感。賦小樓連苑一闋。紀此淸游。到門雨洗芳塵。垂楊凝綠腰肢細。數聲啼鳥。滿庭飛絮。一灣流水。俊侶疏狂。踏靑留影。畫欄同倚。笑匆匆過了湔裙挑菜。倩誰與春痕繫。嫩約倥偬猶記。儘魂銷一簾空翠。泫紅泣露。花昏柳瞑。兩般情味。試舞吳鈎。待斟越釀。暮笳還起。又簫聲吹出新愁如海。把東風懟。</p>

<p>— 李石垣</p>
<p>近年得李將軍景林褚委員民誼提倡國術之力。各地聞風影從。競以練習國技爲快事。顧十年前。李將軍極表稱羨之國術家李一鶚氏。即曾一度任鶴山縣縣長之神槍手（先生精槍擊得名）也。　　先生善技擊。翻騰撲躍。步履如飛。若鷹隼然。恒單衣短褐。膝向前作乘馬狀。數人立其腿上。神色晏如也。氏年老矣。而精神矍鑠。酷類壯時。宰萑苻遍地之鶴山縣方逾年。盜咸相戒不敢入。一日者、氏之戚屬某爲其子完姻。大張喜筵。正馳箋邀氏入席。盜結黨百餘。蜂擁呼嘯前來。適閽者報氏至。盜咸咋舌謂曰。敗事。神槍手未可犯也。頃刻作鳥獸散。氏之威人。人之服氏。有如是者。</p>
<p>五年前。氏聞革命偉人孫總理中山逝世事。曾哭之慟。自撰輓聯哀之云。「中原多故徒悲我」「山斗空瞻萎哲人」。綴入中山二字。幾如天衣無縫。特附錄於此。</p>

<p>— 徐筱汀自津寄</p>
<p>來津一週。日與老友沙游天蹀　歌塲。品評時伶因將所獲沾上菊界之最近消息。綴之如次。</p>
<p>艷秋滬上前傳已蓄鬚輟歌。沽上亦言之鑿鑿。且有謂程係避新艷秋之鋒芒而不得不爾者。未免厚衊玉霜矣。上月程曾偕菊朋壽臣妙香來津獻藝。此說乃不攻自破。游天語余。「，艷秋確已病肥。彩褲連放腰三次。嗓音日漸鬆弛。寬音每雜刺耳之聲。不復能似曩昔之收放自如矣。扮相則尙未損及其美。此次程爲自身聲譽計。極肯賣力。結果故佳。」程返平後。自成一班。又約芙蓉草加入。聲勢殊不弱。現沽上蛺蝶大戲院。已約定程伶於四月十九二十兩晚演碧玉簪及金鎖記。廣告已經露佈多日。特標出程劇二字以資號召。足見　人對於艷秋歡迎之熱烈矣。</p>
<p>王少樓的係後進鬚生之可造材。嗓音特佳。唱工逼肖叔岩。身上極邊式。做戲頗認眞。所差者念白稍弱耳。前曾在津演過一月。大紅特紅。嗣又偕雪艷琴在春和唱四日。戲票先期已行售空。明日（十一日）又與雪伶偕壽臣瑞安仍在春和演戲三日。戲資竟售二元之多。劇碼有王郝之審潘洪雪周之别姬。（第一夕）王雪之殺家。雪周郝之刺嬸。（第二夕）周郝之長板坡。王雪郝之法門寺。（第三日）周郝之盜御馬。王雪之跑坡登殿。（第三夕）盛况可預卜也。滬上大舞臺黃全生本約艷秋南下程許以下半年履行。黃乃有改約王雪或王于（翠花）之意。據少樓語余南行與否尙待最後之考慮。必自信確有把握。始能成行。然以少樓之藝術而論。此行决無不利之虞。倘能帶銅錘碩果裘桂仙同往。兩隻生面孔。定可呌座。惟旦角須稍費斟酌耳。</p>
<p>富英正在中原公司唱臨别紀念戲。上座尙好。並約小培陪唱甘露寺之喬國老及魯肅。旦角則係佩蘭社所捧之胡碧蘭。此豸新拜小雲門下。唱益工穩平正。坤角中以伊爲最可聽。惟烟容滿面。似非所宜也。中原於富英滿期之後。已約定武生泰斗楊小樓。單人演唱數日。再聘慧生或小雲接後隊。届時必有一番熱閙也。</p>
<p>安舒元已由新明戲院改搭新欣舞臺。此君在津本有人緣。惟嗓音日壞。頗有惜之者。此外尙有天豐園之老牌梆子及新新戲院之奎德社坤班排頼婚及新人的家庭諸劇。均薄有呌座力。天華景則係坤伶綺鸞嬌及黃潤卿之子童伶鬢生黃楚寳之地盤也。（却酬）</p>

<p>第十回　赤燄騰天勾欄欽孝女　紅毹貼地即席唔名伶</p>
<p>阿金道。倒看不出文桂枝三小姐。倒這樣的有良心呀。說說伊還是當么二上小姐出身咧。阿寳道。伊的么上小姐。那是眞正誰也及不上伊。蹩脚點的長三。那裏比得上伊呢。阿金道。想來這位老太。一定是伊的嫡親祖母了。要是領了來的。那裏有這樣的孝伊呢。阿寳道。我聽得他們講。文桂枝三小姐。從小伊的母親就死了。生下了伊不過一個月。伊的母親得了産後毛病。就是伊的好婆領大了伊。從小是一經生病。奶也没有好好兒吃過。喂伊一點兒奶粉。。就這樣領大了的。伊的爺是專門喝酒賭錢。把伊賣在節二堂子裏。幸虧伊生得標緻。也是運氣好。跳到長三上來。所以伊總不忘記伊的祖母。這就叫做自己親生養的。到底是有良心的。他們說到這兩句。一面望望這位大阿姨。一面看看蕊雲等一班買來討人。覺得這話說得有些兒忌諱。便不再說下去了。話兒岔到别的地方去。說道。這一下子文桂三小姐。到底損失不少呀。首飾不用去說了。他們又没有小房子。所有東西。都要放在生意上。就是衣服。堂子裏的衣服。果然隔了一兩年。就要覺得不時髦。但是你做做的時候。都是大價錢。你要現在做全那單夾棉皮的衣服。可也不是容易的事呀。不知他們保過險没有。倘然保了險的。究竟還好點。即使賠不足。賠了一半。究竟也拿到一半咧。大阿姨道。堂子裏誰去保險呢。因爲我們是時常要掉頭的。往往住了兩節三節。就要掉到别處去。保險不是很費事嗎。有了小房子的。那末保保險還値得。今年倒也有一個客人。打合我阿要保險。看這個樣子。倒引起我想保險的心了。一年也不過多花費十幾兩銀子。可以保三千兩銀子的險。倒底一放心咧。阿寳道。我聽得文桂枝三小姐。有一位要好的客人。說是姓顔。大家都叫他顔大人的。是一位道台大人咧。不過走起路來。一隻脚有點一𨀌一𨀌。人家也�</p>
<p>有叫他顔蹻脚的。據說是從前打東洋的時候。他吃過一粒子彈咧。這位顔大人很有錢。現在燒去了東西。怕這位顔大人不賠還伊嗎。今天也是剛從顔大人那裏堂唱轉來。有了這樣的好客人。比了保險還要好。</p>

<p>— 來</p>
<p>本星期自遷移之後。上座仍滿。茲已定於第四星期（即遷移後之第二星期）更改劇目。原擬改爲閙學蘆花蕩羽舞打漁殺家。現因日本戲於昨晚開演。紐約各報皆云不及中國劇之沉着等語。且此間觀衆在台下鼓掌最多者。爲舞劍及桂芳之要刀下場。然報中評論贊揚者。則爲汾河灣刺虎。吾戲旣以沈着博得美譽。以後當然在沈着處用力。故擬改劇目。最後决定如下。第一醉酒之一段。後二蘆花蕩。第三西施之羽舞。第四打魚殺家。以上四戲。已斟酌妥善。排演數次。俟星期夜彩排。仍請各界參觀批評。</p>
<p>日前劇界公會請畹晚餐。到者五百餘人。畹有演說。該會并送畹及全團人員名譽會員證各一。此亦爲紐約劇界公會未有之舉。</p>
<p>近來各名角無論老幼。都來觀劇。且都到後台見面。表示敬意。有一名角云。女子之醉本極難看。中國劇能形容至此。實在是意想所不及。於此可知中國劇組織之高深。梅君藝術之精妙矣。有幾位老太太。看了打魚殺家。說中國姑娘眞好。無論自己多們不願意。也要委曲求全。使她的父親高興。我們美國有姑娘則永遠不會將就人的。此蓋係有感而言也。</p>
<p>昨日又晤楊君。談甚暢。楊君云。此次梅君來美之組織。最爲適當。宣傳亦恰如其分。前者有外國人到此。因宣傳逾分。名不副實而致失敗者。頗有其人。此次一切辦法。皆極妥善。吾當與中國通信爲文以贊美之。嗣問以何報爲宜。當告以滬津平各大報均可。不日彼當有通信披露也。彼又謂打魚殺家之扮像。異常之美。所謂完全中國式矣。畹華素性譧和。故彼又云。一人成此大名。而仍謙恭如此。安得不成世界大人物乎。吾於此點極端佩服。且美國名角往往自滿自大。而此次對於梅君。則一點也不肯驕傲云云。</p>

<h3 id="e20">World Trends and the London Naval Conference <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>All countries that recognize the world's general trend know that today's powerful nations cannot rely on their strength for long. Therefore, they are all planning ways to manage the situation. Since the decline of commerce cannot be reversed in the short term, the only option is to reduce national expenditures. The largest expenditure of a country is military spending, and among military expenditures, the navy is particularly significant. If all naval powers compete in building warships as they did before the European War, it would be difficult to cope with in today's declining commercial environment. Even if commerce were not declining, they would inevitably face financial difficulties. Therefore, today's naval reduction conference among the major powers is not truly about abandoning war and ending hostilities. It is about each wanting to escape the future economic dangers. Therefore, today's arms reduction efforts are more sincere than before the European War. There is no other reason than being compelled by the world's general trend and having no other choice.</p>
<p>However, even if arms reduction achieves some success, it is not accurate to assume that this will eliminate the scourge of war. Why? Since commerce is declining daily, the number of people suffering from economic pressure is increasing. Those already affected are thinking of ways to break free, while those about to be affected are devising methods to increase the pressure on others. Disputes between people and between countries are becoming increasingly urgent. In such a situation, can the hope of peace be realized? Even if enlightened individuals loudly call for reconciliation, one side is compelled by the reality of the situation, while the other side finds that new ideas are incompatible with old habits. Neither side can be forcibly removed, so the hope of peace cannot be seen in the future. Even the success of an arms reduction agreement will not help.</p>

<p>▲Reuters, London, 17th: The naval conference draft is expected to be completed the day after tomorrow. At that time, the general outline of the agreement will be telegraphed to the US and Japanese governments. If a reply is received early, a plenary meeting can be convened on Tuesday. However, the opinions of the governments concerned may not arrive in England in time, so the postponement of the plenary meeting is also expected. The chief representatives of Britain, the United States, and Japan discussed the safeguard clauses that need to be added to the three-nation agreement yesterday. It is heard that this clause stipulates that if any signatory country believes that its naval status is hindered by any country outside the three-nation agreement, the diplomatic organs should consult with each other, and the affected country may, after reasonable notification, increase its own shipbuilding program. This clause has already been drafted and telegraphed to Tokyo for the Japanese government to study.</p>
<p>▲Reuters, London, 17th: This afternoon, Labour MP Gan Weixi asked in the House of Commons, now that the three-nation naval agreement has been established, whether the Singapore military base, such as the equipment that allows the largest battleships to enter the dock for repairs, is planned to proceed. Naval Minister Alexander Alexandria replied that this matter must refer to the treaty to be signed by the countries attending the naval conference soon, and make extremely careful consideration. This kind of investigation will be done as soon as possible, and detailed consultations will be made with the overseas colonies concerned. Gan Weixi also asked whether the policy announced by the United Kingdom, hoping that large battleships will eventually be destroyed, has greatly changed the situation. If so, what is the purpose of building a dock to accommodate large battleships? The Secretary of the Navy replied that it is useless to discuss this at present. Churchill said that the government's current policy should not be changed before the Imperial Conference is held in the fall. The Secretary of the Navy was unwilling to agree to this suggestion.</p>
<p>▲National News Agency, Washington, 17th: President Hoover and Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, discussed the three-nation naval agreement in the White House this morning. Afterwards, Senator Borah declared that the talks were purely preliminary in nature. At this time, it is too early to talk about any practical plans for submitting it to the Senate for approval. The Senate has not heard any opposition to this agreement in general. He personally feels satisfied because the agreement does not contain political clauses. As for the Foreign Relations Committee, it will consider the agreement as soon as possible, but the date will depend on the return of the US representative Stimson from London.</p>
<p>▲Telecommunications Agency, London, 17th: The main points of the security guarantee agreement established between the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States are as follows: (1) If a country deems it necessary to increase its naval vessels due to matters arising with another country, it may do so. (2) When increasing naval vessels, it is necessary to report the matters that make it necessary to increase naval vessels to other countries, as well as the shipbuilding plan. (3) When the above-mentioned matters occur, a third country reserves the right to increase naval vessels. (4) The number of naval vessels and other matters to be increased must be decided after negotiations between the countries concerned.</p>

<p>Telecommunications Agency, Tokyo, 18th: The Privy Council's scrutiny committee, under a serious warning, passed the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement. The reason is that the agreement is an important case at the root of the Treaty of Commerce, and its content has a significant impact on Japan's trade with China in the future. It is regrettable that there is a view of reducing national rights. However, according to the government's reply, the United Kingdom and other countries have exchanged documents unconditionally, and only Japan is the last. In order to respect Sino-Japanese friendship and international faith, the case is recognized. However, Japan is different from other countries and has a great stake in China. China has always had a habit of signing treaties but not implementing them. The government should pay attention to this point so that there are no omissions in diplomacy with China.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 17th – Senator Dill stated that the merger of the radio businesses of General Electric, RCA Victor, and Radio Corporation of America (RCA) will create a global electricity, radio, and electrical manufacturing trust. RCA has exclusive agreements with almost every country in the world except Russia. This move was spearheaded by Owen Young (who drafted the Young Plan). Further control of international banks will achieve the goal of creating the world’s largest trust. RCA Chairman David Sarnoff announced the merger immediately after meeting with the President yesterday, hoping to indirectly indicate that the President has also approved. However, he does not believe that President Hoover supports this plan.</p>

<p>▲ National News Agency, Iloilo City, Philippines, 18th – The fire at the Buenavista sawmill on Negros Island was the largest in Philippine history. According to reports today, the death toll has reached 20. The island's police department, the Red Cross, and the provincial government are sending personnel to the fire site to search for the bodies of the dead. The actual financial loss is likely to be more than the amount reported by the United Press International. Transportation in the surrounding area has not yet been restored. People arriving from the vicinity of the fire stated that the tragedy was heartbreaking. Fortunately, the neighborhood of Lopez Jaena near Barotac Viejo was spared by a body of water. In addition to the town and all the company's buildings being reduced to ashes, a total of 25 million board feet of lumber was destroyed. The number of workers who lost their jobs due to the burning of the company reached 5,000, and 13,000 people were left destitute. Authorities are trying to resettle this large number of refugees.</p>

<h3 id="e61">National Government Holds Commemoration of the Third Anniversary of Establishing Nanjing as Capital <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Today (the 18th) is the third anniversary of the National Government establishing Nanjing as its capital. Shops and residences in Nanjing hung national flags to celebrate. The National Government held a commemorative ceremony in the auditorium at 10:00 AM. Attendees included Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, Wang Chonghui, Gu Yingfen, Wang Zhengting, Zhang Nanxian, and other officials from the National Government's military and civil service departments, as well as senior officials from various departments, totaling more than 600 people. The order of the ceremony was as follows: (1) All stand at attention; (2) Music is played; (3) The Party song is sung; (4) Three bows are made to the Party and national flags and the portrait of the Generalissimo; (5) Chairman Hu reads the Generalissimo's will; (6) The chairman delivers a speech, stating that Chairman Chiang was unable to attend due to an inspection of the Boy Scouts, and Chairman Tan was not well enough to speak, so he (Hu) would say a few words. Since 1927, the nation and the international community have recognized that the divided and turbulent China ruled by warlords has been unified by the Kuomintang through revolutionary force. Three years ago today, during a time of military urgency, we resolutely and unanimously advocated for establishing Nanjing as the capital. The reasons were: (1) The Generalissimo had decided to make Nanjing the capital after the revolution in 1912, and we should follow his instructions and establish the capital in Nanjing; (2) Every country must move its capital to a new location after major reforms to avoid being infected by old and bad habits, as seen in the recent examples of Russia and Turkey; (3) Nanjing has the qualifications to be a capital in terms of history, transportation, industry, commerce, and culture. Everyone knows that Ankara, the new capital of Turkey, initially had a population of only tens of thousands, and even though it has been the capital for seven or eight years, the population is still not very large, and many construction projects are still in their infancy. However, from a revolutionary standpoint, we should admire them very much. The difficulties of building a capital in Nanjing are less than those in Ankara, and it is also a place designated by the Generalissimo, so we should work hard to achieve our goal of building a perfect capital in the short term. Some people still do not understand, thinking that the capital is not important, and that Nanjing is good, but other places are also possible. This is a big mistake. It must be understood that the capital of a country is like the brain of a person. All undertakings must rely on it to lead. Guangzhou in the south, and Beiping and Xi'an in the north, must be reorganized and built, but everything should have priorities. The best area of a country should naturally be built up as soon as possible. The Capital Construction Committee has now decided on a very good overall construction plan, and in the future, it will be up to us to implement it diligently. I hope that after our capital is completed, it will be comparable to the famous capitals of Europe and America. There are still some stubborn people who do not recognize the big picture, always thinking that people from a certain province should go back to that province and work hard, and that building the capital is not important. This is also a big mistake and should be corrected. In recent years, our efforts have not fully achieved our goals or satisfied the wishes of the people, but we have always followed the Generalissimo's instructions, and there has been some progress and success in education, politics, law, and other aspects. This is something we can be proud of, but no matter what, we are still far from our predetermined goals and must not be complacent. We should work even harder to complete our revolutionary mission in the short term. Hu concluded his speech, followed by music, photography, and adjournment.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Central Propaganda Department Issues Letter of Encouragement to Comrades Trapped in the North <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department issued a letter of encouragement to comrades trapped in the North today (the 18th), stating: "Since the founding of the Republic of China, the people have suffered and groaned under the division and devastation of feudal warlords for more than ten years. Thanks to the Generalissimo of our Party for calling for struggle in the past, and the continued efforts of all comrades in the future, we were finally able to eliminate the huge and stubborn Northern Warlords and unify our Republic of China. The Central Government, in accordance with the revolutionary program, rigorously implemented political tutelage and construction, hoping that unity would be permanently guaranteed and the people's hardships would be slightly alleviated. Unexpectedly, in the past year, disasters and chaos have repeatedly occurred. Rebellions by Gui, Zhang, Feng, Tang, and other rebels occurred successively, betraying the Party and the country, causing the smooth progress of political tutelage and construction to be hindered, and the people throughout the country suffered from upheaval and displacement again. However, with the loyalty and bravery of our revolutionary soldiers and the joint efforts of all comrades, they were finally put out in the shortest possible time. The successive defeats of these old and new warlords are enough to enlighten the stubborn military personnel. However, Yan Xishan's rebellious ambitions have not died, and he is prone to chaos by nature. Without learning from the past, he is willing to be Feng Yuxiang's successor. He first issued fallacious remarks to confuse the public, and then implemented betrayal, destroying unity, recruiting corrupt remnants, colluding with imperialists, mobilizing troops, and invading southward in multiple routes. He has already isolated himself from the Party and the country and the people. His rebellious acts are obvious and he cannot escape punishment. Our comrades in the North have embraced our ideology, and their faith is unwavering. Motivated by their enthusiasm for protecting the Party and loving the country, they have severely condemned Yan's heresies and atrocities, and have also printed and distributed publications, striving to publicize and clarify the central government's peaceful objectives and correct the views of the people throughout the country. As a result, they have been repeatedly subjected to Yan's oppression, their speech has been suppressed, their actions have lost freedom, arrests have occurred one after another, and prisons have been filled. Our comrades, who have been protecting the Party and the country, have been subjected to oppression, and we feel deeply grateful and saddened. However, our comrades in the North have not been discouraged or intimidated by this. Even under the pressure of Yan's oppressive power, they have continued to make relentless efforts in the spirit of the Generalissimo's great fearlessness, denouncing and demanding punishment. This spirit of unwavering bravery and continued sacrifice and struggle is not only enough to chill the rebels but also enough to inspire the hearts of the people throughout the country, making them aware that revolution and counter-revolution cannot coexist, and that only such sacrifice and struggle can eliminate the obstacles to political tutelage and complete the great cause of revolution. It is therefore that our comrades in the North have made sacrifices and struggled today for an unparalleled glorious price. The central government offers comfort to our comrades for this reason. Yan combines corruption and evil in one furnace, plotting one last attempt. Although his strength is not enough to shake the central government or harm the Party and the country, his resistance is still enough to prolong the war and increase the suffering of the people. The swift eradication of the last warlords and the complete realization of the national revolution depend on the greater sacrifice and struggle of all comrades. If comrades have any thoughts of fear or complacency at this time, not only will the eradication of this remaining vestige of the Northern Warlords be hopeless, but all the already fallen warlords and the remaining counter-revolutionary forces will also rekindle, and all past sacrifices and struggles will be in vain, and the people throughout the country will once again fall into the heavy siege of feudal warlords' division and oppression, which cannot be resolved. Therefore, at this time of the final showdown between revolution and counter-revolution, all our comrades must raise the spirit of great fearlessness and make the greatest determination and sacrifice in order to achieve a sweeping victory, eliminate the root of reaction forever, ensure the unity of the country, so that the people's livelihood can be constructed smoothly, and the political tutelage can be realized as scheduled. Our revolutionary comrades in the North were the vanguard of the May Fourth and March 18th Revolutions, and have long struggled under the feudal forces in the North. Their spirit of sacrificing for the Party has long been recognized by the people of the country. At a time when the remnants of the Northern Warlords and the remaining counter-revolutionaries are encircling our Party, they must reaffirm the history and personality of the revolution, uphold the spirit of the past, and make the final battle. The full success of the revolution lies in this one action. May our comrades in the North encourage each other."</p>
<h3 id="e63">Central Propaganda Department Hosts Press Conference <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>▲ Wu Zhihui Reports on His Thoughts on the Current Situation</p>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department hosted a press conference in the Second Conference Hall of the Central Committee at 2:00 PM on the 17th, with about 20 reporters stationed in Nanjing and from Shanghai, Wuhan, Peiping, Tianjin, and other places. Liu Lu Yin presided over the meeting. After the opening ceremony, he introduced Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, who made the following report:</p>
<p>"I have been busy for days and have not had time to pay attention to the so-called current situation. I will only offer a few of my thoughts from the past few days for your amusement. Now we are in a period of military rule again. Why has this period reappeared? According to my personal thoughts, I will briefly state one or two points. When I went to the North last winter, I had no idea that there would be any military affairs, because Yan Xishan is not a person with any ambition. As for someone occupying territory, it can be forgiven, because he wants to show off his skills and must have a place for him to experiment. Judging from the past situation in Shanxi, he seemed to be cautious and had some political interest. It is also good to have a place for him to experiment. But later, when I went to the North, I saw that he was secretly manipulating everything. The Central Government gave him political responsibility for the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan, and he himself thought that Shanxi Province alone was not enough to develop his talents, and ambition was born. On the one hand, it is said that he is occupying territory. On the other hand, it can also be said that he is the key to the northern gate. If he does not cause trouble and the northern provinces are entrusted to him, it is not a big deal. If he can really be the key to the northern gate, it is already hard enough for him. So his words are very satisfying. If everyone trusts each other, it will be fine. In reality, no matter which aspect, when the burden has not yet been picked up, one feels very confident. Once it is picked up, one becomes very dissatisfied. Since he is openly opposed, he will naturally have to put on a show on stage. It is inevitable that he will mess things up beyond repair. If he continues to experiment like this, when will it end? It should be known that the people will sometimes not allow them to experiment. Moreover, now there is no way out. There is no time for war. Feng Yuxiang is still performing operas in Shaanxi. In fact, there is not even a blade of grass left in Shaanxi. Who is really saving the country and the people, and who is not wearing a mask? If this continues non-stop, we really dare not make a dogmatic judgment, and we really cannot do it. It is best if they themselves can wake up. All the ugliness of the past does not need to be said to each other. It would be good if everyone could be a little satisfied. The Chinese people love peace. When the time comes, they will also rise up and say, "The revolution has taken away our lives. Please take a rest." Last year, I told him this idea, and he and Mr. Zhao Cilon were very supportive. So far, Mr. Zhao is a little embarrassed and takes a passive attitude. What we don't understand most is the current state of being neither dead nor alive. The Japanese are playing a trick, sometimes helping A against B. When A is about to succeed, they use C against A. If C can succeed, they use another person against C. They are always unwilling to let people succeed. Since they have the strength, they could have made a decisive victory, but they did not come up with this plan, so the current situation in the North has become what it is. Since our Party's Northern Expedition and unification, what we have seen is that key figures should be brought together to the Central Committee, making the Central Committee the Central Committee of everyone. In this situation, stability can be announced. Therefore, after the Tangshan Conference in Beiping, all the key figures gathered in Nanjing and had the sincerity to jointly seek peace. However, Feng Yuxiang showed off his films of the Northwest Army at the Lixingshe, showing his power, which was contrary to the path of peace. As a result, the principle of "Two Greats" was formed. You look down on me, I look down on you. That is the intention. It seems that these films should not be taken out to let people know what the intention is. Before long, everyone felt uncomfortable. So Feng Yuxiang left in January last year. With this departure, he did not want to cooperate, and then ran to the place where the swords and soldiers met. The Guangxi guys are nothing special. May I ask, now that everyone is planning construction, what do they still need soldiers for? The reason why they still want soldiers is that there are a few Chinese sayings, "The beauty of the palace, the service of concubines, the poor people I know have obtained me." Because the poor people I know have obtained me, they are unwilling to cut the soldiers. They will rule one day at a time. Unfortunately, the Guangxi people drove away Lu Dipin, the chairman of Hunan. At that time, Hu Zongduo and Tao Jun were very angry and unwilling to admit their mistakes. Then they even opened fire. Feng Yuxiang first</p>
<p>Indeed, he had some tricks with the Gui faction. At that time, Feng sat on the sidelines, and when Li Zongren and others were defeated, Sun Liangcheng also left Shandong. After the Northwest Army retreated, Zhang Fakui rose up again. When Zhang was in Hubei, the Northwest did not fluctuate, but when Zhang arrived in Hunan, Song Zheyuan, Shi Jingting, and others came out again. These are like joking, simply joking with the people. This kind of rebellion is too unwise, with no purpose at all. We cannot help but sigh. Yan Xichuan now also wants to try it out, seeking the highest position. In fact, what is the method of the highest position? He doesn't understand it at all. What he has seen before is Xu Shichang's set of tricks. He wants to open the door and take a look first. If there is nothing in the east or west, and the civil and military officials are lined up, and when you have no way out, he can swagger out and sit on the dragon throne. Isn't it extremely ridiculous? Liang Zhuoru has a saying that China has too many talents and it is not economical. It is true. Yan Xishan can only be the governor of a province, and Feng Yuxiang can only be a good official. However, they do not do it well and always want to fight, always wanting to be the boss. But turning around and around, they are still a second in command. As for how to be a boss, they don't understand it at all. This is the uneconomical use of talent."</p>
<h3 id="e64">Pre-Decision Points for the Family and Inheritance Sections of the Civil Code (Continued) <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>▲Hu Hanmin and Lin Sen Request the Central Political Council to Decide</p>
<p>(3) Should spouses inherit property? If so, what is their order of succession and what share should they inherit? According to our old laws, there is no clear provision as to whether a husband can inherit his deceased wife's property. If a husband dies without children, a chaste wife may inherit her husband's share, but she must still have the clan leader choose someone of appropriate rank and generation to be an heir, and transfer the inheritance to the future heir. Initially, the wife did not have the right to inherit her husband's property upon his death. In drafting the inheritance law this time, should the spouse of the deceased inherit property? This is the fourth point for preliminary decision. If they are to inherit, what is the order of succession? Foreign laws vary considerably. Some place them in the same order as direct descendants, such as the German and Swiss Civil Codes. Others place them after direct descendants as a secondary heir, such as the Japanese Civil Code. The share to be inherited also varies from country to country. According to the German Civil Code, if the deceased has relatives of the first degree, the spouse of the deceased receives one-quarter of the estate. If there are relatives of the second degree or grandparents, the spouse receives one-half of the estate. If there are grandparents and their direct descendants, the spouse receives one-half, plus the share of the direct descendants. If there are no relatives of the first or second degree, or grandparents, the spouse receives the entire estate. According to the Swiss Civil Code, if the deceased has direct descendants, the spouse may choose to receive either a usufruct of one-half of the estate or full ownership of one-quarter of the estate. If there are parents or their direct descendants, the spouse receives full ownership of one-quarter of the estate and a usufruct of three-quarters. If there are grandparents or their direct descendants, the spouse receives full ownership of one-half of the estate and a usufruct of one-half. If there are no grandparents or their direct descendants, the spouse receives the entire estate. How should our inheritance law be formulated? This is the fifth point for preliminary decision. (4) If, before the commencement of inheritance, an heir has received part of the property from the deceased due to marriage, separation, or business, how should this be calculated when distributing the inheritance? According to our laws on this point, there is no written law to follow. In foreign countries, the value of the gift is added to the value of the property owned by the deceased at the time of inheritance, and this is considered the inheritance property. The calculated share to be inherited is then reduced by the value of the gift, as in the Japanese Civil Code. The Swiss Civil Code is generally similar. How should our inheritance law be formulated? This is the sixth point for preliminary decision. (5) How should the inherited property be distributed among those with the same right to inherit, based on whether they have contributed to the inherited property? According to our old laws, there are no provisions regarding the share to be inherited by an heir who has contributed to the inherited property. The Swiss Civil Code has explicit solutions to this point. A son who is of age and lives with his parents, providing labor or income, may request reasonable compensation when dividing the estate, unless he explicitly waives it. How should our inheritance law be formulated? This is the seventh point for preliminary decision. (6) If guaranteed inheritance portions are to be stipulated, how should they be stipulated? According to our old laws, there are only provisions for inherited shares. The scope of the deceased's right to dispose of property is not clearly defined. Should our inheritance law follow the legislative examples of most countries and stipulate guaranteed inheritance portions? This is the eighth point for preliminary decision. If guaranteed inheritance portions are to be stipulated, what should their scope be? This is also a problem. In Germany, the guaranteed inheritance portion is half the value of the legal inherited share. In Switzerland, direct descendants receive three-quarters of their share, parents receive one-half each, and siblings receive one-quarter each. When the surviving spouse inherits together with other legal heirs, they inherit the entire property. When the spouse is the sole heir, they inherit one-half. In Japan, the rules differ depending on whether the heir is a head of household or an inheritor of property, and also depending on whether they are a direct descendant or not. How should our inheritance law be formulated? This is the ninth point for preliminary decision. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Suppression of Foreign-Licensed Opium Dens in Fujian Province <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲Result of Negotiations by the Anti-Opium Association with the Japanese Consulate. Fuzhou Correspondence: Most of the Taiwanese people residing in Fuzhou and Xiamen make a living by opening opium dens and selling opium. Since Fujian Province implemented opium suppression, the opium dens and opium businesses run by Fujianese have been completely banned. The Taiwanese people have seized this opportunity to seek profit alone. In total, there are hundreds of foreign-licensed opium dens and opium businesses in Fuzhou and Xiamen. The harm they cause to society is imaginable. The provincial government has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese consulate to ban them, but without effect. Recently, the provincial anti-opium committee discovered that the procedures for opening these foreign businesses require Taiwanese people to first report the business name, address, capital, and business type to the Japanese consulate, which then sends personnel to investigate and issue a special license before allowing them to open. However, the majority of foreign businesses that specialize in selling opium have not been formally approved by the consulate. Some have had their licenses revoked but still display them. Others have opened businesses privately without permission. Still others have registered and obtained licenses, but the location of the business does not match the original application, or the name of the business owner or manager does not match the license. Some falsely report their license number and set up multiple branches without displaying goods, privately transferring profits. There are also cases of using expired licenses or false numbers to deceive and replace legitimate businesses, leading to numerous abuses. The committee specifically sent member Shi Ming to visit the Japanese consul in Fuzhou, Tamura Teiichi, requesting that Chinese authorities be allowed to send personnel to search and close down these illegal and informal foreign businesses in conjunction with the Japanese consulate police. The Japanese consul initially made excuses to evade the request, but after repeated arguments by Committee Member Shi, he agreed to comply. However, he said that they would first send personnel to investigate and order the closure of foreign businesses that were found to be illegal. If the Chinese authorities discovered any more illegal businesses, they would then conduct a joint search with the police. Therefore, in recent days, the Japanese consulate has sent many police officers to investigate over thirty businesses, including Baoli Foreign Business on Shanghang Street, and found that they were all engaged in illegal activities and would be suppressed. At the same time, before the joint action with the Japanese police, our side also dispatched detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to station themselves in front of various foreign businesses, specifically waiting for Chinese citizens to enter to smoke opium or buy opium, and then detaining them for investigation. Dozens of people have already been arrested. After this cleanup, the opium haze that pervades Fuzhou may gradually be expected to wane. (April 16)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3 id="e66">A Glimpse of Sian's Capture by Bandits <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲Military and Police Jointly Attack and Recapture on the 16th</p>
<p>▲Three Bandit Leaders Killed and Over Three Hundred Bandits Killed</p>
<p>Huzhou Correspondence: Bandit gangs in Huzhou Prefecture have been rampant in recent years, especially in the Changxing area, where the situation has become extremely serious. Since the Taihu bandit gangs were suppressed last winter and fled to Changxing, they have joined forces with the remnants of Anhui's Bao Gang and the Big Sword Society, resulting in an increase in their arrogance. Cases of looting villages and kidnapping for ransom occur almost daily. In the past ten days, they have successively confiscated the firearms of the defense corps in more than ten places, including Xucang, Xiayuan, and Dukou in Changxing, and publicly declared that they would attack certain cities and towns on a fixed date. On the 14th of this month, about 5,000 bandits suddenly gathered at Changqiao Pass, the intersection of Si'an and Lincheng Bridge in Changxing, to attack an important town. The bandit situation was dangerous. After receiving the news, the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 30th Regiment of the 5th National Army stationed nearby, as well as the security team and water police, immediately deployed to suppress them. However, due to the disparity in numbers, more than 2,000 bandits occupied Si'an Town, the commercial center of Changxing, at 8:00 AM on the 15th. After the military and police fought bravely, Si'an was finally recaptured at 8:00 AM on the 16th. The information obtained is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>▲General Bandit Situation: The bandits who plunder various parts of Changxing are generally divided into three major groups: one is the remnants of Bao Gang, one is the Taihu bandit gang, and the other is the Big Sword Society from the Anhui border. In total, they number no less than 5,000 to 6,000 people. On the 7th of this month, these bandits surrounded Guangde County, Anhui, which is very close to Changxing. Fortunately, County Magistrate Zhou personally led the self-defense corps to defend the city, fighting fiercely with the bandits for a day and night, and the siege was lifted. After the bandits were defeated in Guangde, they fled back to Changxing to gather, spread out scouts, confiscated the firearms of the defense corps, and recruited ruffians and local thugs, creating a huge commotion. However, this disorganized crowd is no match for a single blow from the military and police.</p>
<p>▲Attack on Si'an: Si'an is the commercial center of Changxing County. In recent years, it has worked hard on construction, and the municipal administration is quite impressive. Transportation is also very convenient. It takes six hours by steamship to reach Wuxing. Moreover, this area is a rice-producing region, and merchants travel back and forth, year after year. Therefore, it is especially coveted by bandits. On the 14th, several thousand bandits gathered at Changqiao Pass, twenty miles from the town. When the National Army and the security team sent troops to suppress them, the bandits retreated to Si'an. The town's defenses were weak and ineffective, and it was eventually occupied by the bandits at 8:00 AM on the 15th.</p>
<p>▲Occupied for One Day: At 8:00 AM on the 15th, a large group of bandits arrived at Si'an Town. All transportation facilities, such as telephones, were simultaneously cut off from the outside world. Most of the bandits were dressed in short clothes, with some wearing military uniforms like soldiers. The People's Army banners were planted all around the town, and several bandit leaders went to the Chamber of Commerce to demand 100,000 yuan in military expenses. The members of the Chamber of Commerce agreed to pay the money at 2:00 PM on the 16th. The bandit leaders then notified the remaining bandits not to disturb the residents. Therefore, no robbery incidents occurred in the town. The next morning, at 8:00 AM, the National Army and the security team and water police launched attacks from different directions and recaptured the town. In total, the town was occupied by the bandits for twelve hours.</p>
<p>▲Military and Police Attack: When the bandits occupied Si'an, the 1st Battalion of the 30th Regiment of the 5th National Army and the 1st Company of the 2nd Security Regiment stationed there were counterattacked by the bandits and retreated to the Taiping Bridge area. After a fierce battle for an hour, the bandits were no match for the troops, and the troops retreated back to Lincheng Bridge. At that time, Hang Yi, the bandit suppression commander of Huzhou and commander of the 2nd Security Regiment, received an urgent telegram from the area and personally led two platoons of machine gun soldiers on the county government's steamship to Lincheng Bridge on the morning of the 15th. On the way, the ship's machinery broke down, so they turned back and changed to the Jialu warship. However, the rivers in the western countryside are mostly shallow and narrow, making it difficult for the ship to navigate. Therefore, it was already 11:00 AM when they arrived at Lincheng Bridge. He then joined forces with the 1st Battalion of the 30th Regiment of the 5th National Army and the 11th Water Police Team, and commanded the 7th, 8th, 9th, and 3rd Companies of the 2nd Security Regiment to attack the Si'an bandits from the left and right flanks, using mortars to advance. After a fierce battle for five hours, the bandits finally collapsed and withdrew from Si'an. One group fled towards Changqiao Pass, and another group escaped towards Meixi in Anji.</p>
<p>▲Confirmed Number of Deaths: When the military and police jointly suppressed the bandits, the National Army took the left flank, the security team took the right flank, and the water police were in the center. Their momentum was extremely fierce. Therefore, the total number of bandits killed was over 300, and many were captured. More than twenty wooden-shell guns were seized. The military and police also suffered nearly a hundred deaths. Among the bandits killed, three bandit leaders were identified: one was Yu Chengyi (formerly a training officer for the Shaoxing Defense Corps), one was Li Guangxin, and one was Wang Zibin. These three bandits were confirmed to be bandit leaders. It is not yet known whether any other bandit leaders were killed. It is also said that the company commander of the 9th Company of the 2nd Security Regiment went missing during the suppression of the bandits. The truth is not yet clear. Bandit Suppression Commander Hang Yi is currently personally leading troops to pursue the bandits.</p>
<p>▲Wuxing Martial Law: Since the bandit incidents in Changxing occurred one after another, Wuxing, which is very close, has also been under heavy guard. Martial law was declared in the city and countryside yesterday. After the news of Si'an's loss spread, the residents were extremely panicked. They were only calmed by the news of the recapture. The county government and the headquarters of the 2nd Security Regiment, deeply concerned that the bandits wreaking havoc in Changxing might have a political background, have already sent telegrams to the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters and the provincial government, requesting that troops be sent to Huzhou to consolidate the defenses.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Resolution of Gao Guizi's Troops <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Gao Guizi's troops have been besieged for nearly two months since February 20th. Those in Zhucheng were besieged by Fan Xiji of the 46th Division, and those in Juxian were besieged by Chen Yaohan of the 26th Division. Although external support has been cut off, they are still resisting stubbornly. There has not been much fighting in the Juxian area, but there has been fierce fighting in the Zhucheng area. Fan's troops have bravely launched several attacks, but were repelled due to heavy artillery fire. Gao's troops have a commanding position on the city, and are protected by the city walls, giving them a significant advantage. Recently, representatives of the Zhucheng people, Pei Mingyu and Zhang Yanyuan, came to Jinan to meet with Chen Diaoyuan, the chairman of the provincial government, requesting a cessation of attacks and a peaceful resolution of the Gao troops, in order to avoid harming the people in the city. Chen indicated that as long as Gao Guizi obeyed the central government, it would be acceptable. The representatives then went from Jinan to Juxian to meet with Gao Guizi to discuss the matter. As a result, Gao agreed to send a telegram to the central government, declaring that he was still willing to serve the party and the country. The other day, Guo Nianzhen, a staff officer of the General Staff Department, and Jiang Huiruo and Cao Jiqing, representatives of Ma Hongkui, went to Juxian to meet with Gao Guizi. Gao requested (1) to be reorganized under Ma Hongkui, (2) to first remove the besieging troops, (3) to provide appropriate back pay, and (4) that the Gao troops would depart for Tai'an within two weeks after the besieging troops were removed. The representatives did not dare to make a decision on these conditions on their own, so they came to Jinan to consult with Ma Hongkui and Chen Diaoyuan, and were accompanied by Gao's representative Han Shuzhi and Juxian's representative Wang Mingshuang. Representatives from Zhucheng and Juxian first met with Ma Hongkui, requesting that Gao's troops be reorganized under his command as soon as possible. Ma agreed. On the 14th, Chen Diaoyuan visited Ma Hongkui at the Jinan Hotel, where he happened to meet the representatives from Zhucheng, including Pei Mingyu. Pei and others reported the details of the negotiations to Chen and requested that the besieging troops be removed as soon as possible. Chen said that if Gao's troops were to be completely reorganized under Ma Hongkui, it might not be appropriate. The representatives said that when they negotiated with Gao Guizi, it was made clear that they would be reorganized under Ma's command. If there were any changes, Gao might not agree. They asked Chairman Chen to consider the people of Zhucheng and resolve the matter once and for all. Chen agreed to consult with Ma Hongkui. Chen was worried that Gao's troops might change their minds after the siege was lifted, but Ma Hongkui promised to take full responsibility and guarantee that Gao would not have other intentions. As a result, Chen agreed to let Ma take full responsibility for resolving the matter, but ordered Gao's troops to depart for Tai'an three days after the besieging troops were removed. Gao's troops requested to depart after two weeks. Regarding this point, Cao Jiqing, Ma Hongkui's representative, has gone to Juxian again to negotiate with Gao. After an agreement is reached, the besieging troops can be removed within a week. It is reported that there are 2,000 of Gao's troops in Juxian, 2,000 in Zhucheng, and 3,000 in Qingtuo Temple (100 li north of Yishui), for a total of over 7,000 people. According to the representatives, Juxian has not suffered other direct damage from the war except for commerce and food. Zhucheng, on the other hand, has suffered significant losses. Two-thirds of the houses in the city have been destroyed by bombing. In total, 40 120-pound bombs and 80 40-pound bombs were dropped by aircraft. One day last month, Fan's artillery fired over a thousand incendiary shells into the city, but were spared thanks to rain. Although the artillery fire was so intense, Gao's troops and the people were hiding in underground tunnels, so there were not many casualties. The Zhucheng war disaster is unprecedented in the past hundred years. The material losses are estimated to be over a hundred thousand yuan. (16th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">A Scene from the Vietnamese Independence Movement <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>▲Activities of the Vietnamese Nationalist Party</p>
<p>▲The Incident of February 10th</p>
<p>This year marks the centenary of France's occupation of Algeria. Celebrations are being held in Paris and its North African colonies, which are at their peak. France's overseas expansion has lasted for only a century. It initially developed in the Americas and North Africa, and then gradually planted its power in the Far East. After the Sino-French War in 1885, Annam became its protectorate. In 1898, it leased Guangzhou Bay. After the Great War, France regained a part of Germany's pre-war colonies. Thus, France became one of the largest colonial empires in the world, second only to Britain in terms of its vast overseas territories. At the London Conference, France demanded a large naval fleet, precisely to maintain communication between its motherland and its territories. At the same time, the government's plans and the parliament's proposals all focus on expanding overseas. Now that France has become a world colonial power, its newly emerging major industries and overly inflated financial capital must seek outlets overseas.</p>
<p>However, colonial powers cannot but rely on force as the foundation for their maintenance, and the peoples of various places, often fearing oppression, are prone to resistance. This year, India's independence movement has been relentless, and Gandhi's peaceful revolution is undermining the colonial policy of the British government. At the same time, the Vietnamese people, who have been silent for a long time, have also raised the banner of rebellion, and the French government cannot but pay attention to it. From this, it can be seen that the independence movements of the Eastern peoples, although temporarily quiet, have never ceased in secret.</p>
<p>The number of people participating in this Vietnamese Independence Party's rebellion was not large, and it was quelled in less than a day. Although the French government and the public are very calm, judging from the serious questions in the parliament and the various measures taken afterwards, it is not difficult to infer the seriousness of the internal situation. Although this incident arose in haste, its brewing was not a matter of a day. Since last year, the Annam national independence movement has gradually become active. Throughout last year, arrests of Annam political prisoners were frequently heard. Before that, the Annam nationalist movement had an organization called the Vietnamese Nationalist Party, which had been active secretly since last spring.</p>
<p>Most of the participants were young students and workers. At that time, its leader, Nguyen, was captured by the government and sentenced to three years of imprisonment. At the same time, 150 party members were arrested. In May and June last year, the French authorities searched various bookstores and newspaper editing agencies in Vietnam. Many students at the Vietnamese Normal School were also arrested due to the strike. On July 3, the Vietnamese Criminal Law Committee sentenced twenty-five Annamese to hard labor for fifteen, ten, and five years. Among those imprisoned were several women. On August 5, an Annam party member's entire family was arrested and imprisoned. On September 1, party member Nguyen Fangyan (?) committed suicide in prison. Although the government cracked down severely, the Vietnamese Nationalist Party continued its activities actively, and finally there was the bloody tragedy of February 10 this year.</p>
<p>The incident of February 10th was launched simultaneously in Yangbei (?), Honghe (?), and Hanoi (the above place names are transliterations of French names; I don't have a Chinese dictionary at hand to check, so I translated them according to the sound). The origin and course of the incident are still not clear. The following is based on the reports from the French authorities.</p>
<p>Yangbei, Honghe, and Hanoi are all in Tongking Province and are all important towns along the Kwong-Viet Railway. Hanoi is the capital of Tongking Province. Yangbei is only 200 li from the old border of our country and can reach Mengzi in a few hours. The Vietnamese Nationalist Party secretly mobilized soldiers stationed in Yangbei, who rose up at 1:00 AM and attacked the residences of French military officers, and occupied the armory. The French army was caught off guard and almost unable to resist. It was not until dawn that the French army began to gather the remnants and besiege the rebels. Before long, order was completely restored. More than twenty revolutionaries died, twenty-five were captured, and only three escaped. In addition, many Annam civilians were arrested. In this battle, five French military officers were killed and two were injured.</p>
<p>At the same time, in Honghe, more than twenty party members attacked the French military camp with pistols and bombs, but failed. They jumped into the Red River and fled, and many were captured by the French soldiers. Their leader died there.</p>
<p>On the evening of February 10, when the news of the Yangbei and Honghe revolts spread to Hanoi, the Hanoi party members seized the opportunity to respond. At that time, many party members riding bicycles threw bombs at the courthouse, the merchandise display hall, the police station, and the front of the French Governor-General's office, but no damage was caused. At that time, many people were captured by the French military police. According to those arrested, the purpose of throwing bombs was to prevent the Hanoi garrison from going to the aid of Yangbei.</p>
<p>The above is all information obtained from the French government. This incident arose suddenly, and only a few dozen people participated in the rebellion, so it was quickly quelled. By February 12, the entire Indochina was at peace. However, French troops are still searching for party members. Yesterday (March 28), the Vietnamese Criminal Committee (a special court established by the French government to try rebel criminals) announced the verdicts of those arrested in the Yangbei revolt. A total of thirty-nine people were sentenced to death, thirty-three were sentenced to life imprisonment, nine were sentenced to twenty years of hard labor, one was sentenced to five years of hard labor, and five were deported. According to investigations, five Frenchmen were killed before and after the incident, while more than thirty revolutionaries were killed in action, and thirty-nine were sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Because the incident occurred along the Kwong-Viet Railway and was very close to the border of our Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan provinces, the French government suspected that the rebel party was instigated by communists from our country. We can certainly ignore this. In short, the Vietnamese people's independence movement is influenced by our country's National Revolution and India's anti-British movement, and its momentum is irresistible. It is feared that it cannot be stopped so easily. (March 29, sent from Paris by Lu Zi)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Wuhu Quick Dispatch <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>▲Bandit gangs in Fanchang County besieged the city. The commander of the Capital Garrison Regiment stationed in Wuhu, Lü Xueshu, recently personally led troops to suppress them. The Wuhu County Government also dispatched the Self-Defense General Regiment to assist, as ordered by the province. Yesterday, Lü's regiment encountered the bandits in Xinlinpu, near Fanchang, and engaged them in a fierce battle for several hours. The bandit leader Yang Laosi was killed on the spot, and more than thirty bandits were killed. Thirty-four long and short guns and several horses were seized. The remaining bandits scattered and fled, and are still being pursued. The Wuhu Self-Defense Regiment has advanced to Fanchang City, and the city has been turned from danger to safety. As for the bandit trouble in Guangde, Li Yuankai, the deputy commander of the Garrison Regiment, has also led the entire Third Battalion to suppress them. They arrived in Xuancheng yesterday, and along the way, they received several urgent telegrams from County Magistrate Zhou of Guangde, claiming that over eight hundred bandits had gathered at the border between Guangde and Changxing, threatening to attack Guangde, and the county seat was under extreme pressure. Li has now proceeded at full speed to discuss suppression methods with County Magistrate Zhou. The Garrison Regiment now only has two infantry companies remaining in Wuhu, led by Adjutant Huang Youyu. It is said that Huang will also lead troops to suppress bandit gangs that have emerged in Nanling County within the next few days.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Food Maintenance Association investigated the rice reserves in Wuhu and carried out registration. As a result, it was found that there were only over 30,000 shi of rice in the entire city, which is estimated to be enough for only half a month's food supply for the city. Therefore, inspections to prevent smuggling are even more stringent. People have also been sent to various rice mills and rice hullers to re-examine. If any excess rice is reported, it will be confiscated.</p>
<p>▲Due to the flood in the Baisha Embankment in Wuhu, the Provincial Relief Committee has allocated a relief fund of 1,000 yuan. The county government has now stipulated that it will be divided into three grades of four, five, and six yuan, and spring relief will be distributed on the 23rd. (16th)</p>

<p>The Stadium Reverted to County Management: The Nanxiang Stadium was built by the former Township Administrative Bureau on land borrowed from the Zhende and Yuying Orphanages, with a subsidy of 1,500 yuan from the County Education Bureau. Recently, the Nanxiang Second District Office, which is in charge of management, found that the costs were too high and sent a letter to the Education Bureau requesting that it be reverted to county management. The Zhende and Yuying Orphanages have also agreed to the permanent loan of the 20 mu of land. Director Yang of the Education Bureau has reported the situation to the department for approval. Once a reply is received, it will be handled accordingly.</p>
<p>Arrest of Abductor Chen Er'a: A'xiao, the daughter of Wang Li of Malu, was lured and hidden in Shanghai by Chen Er'a last year. A lawsuit was filed with the county government. Recently, Chen Long, a detective from this county stationed in Shanghai, learned of the situation and requested the Shanghai court to arrest him. He was brought back for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>Cranes in the Wind Amidst Bandit Alarms: The southwest of the eighth district of Jiading is mostly adjacent to Kunshan and Qingpu. Since the rampant bandits of the lake areas, residents have lived in a state of anxiety. The defense corps has been working overtime and patrolling, serving the public day and night. On the evening of the 16th, Jin Xiaodi, a farmer from Miaojing Village, went to a neighboring village for a celebratory banquet and saw people holding box cannons and pistols, walking eastward along the tracks. The number was quite large. He hid in fear, holding his breath for a long time. Another person, Mr. Jia, who was going to Zhangyan to comfort relatives who had been kidnapped, said that according to a ransom ticket who escaped from the bandit's lair, he learned that the bandits were coveting Anting. As a result, the city is filled with panic, and even the wealthy dare not live in peace.</p>

<p>A Passenger from Jiaxing Dies of Poisoning: Yesterday (the 17th) afternoon, on the third or fourth class train from Hangzhou, a passenger who boarded in Jiaxing was bitten by a rabid dog. He was in great pain on the train. His ticket was for Songjiang Station. Upon arrival in Songjiang, he was spotted by military police, who ordered him off the train. He claimed to be a partner in a certain tea and food shop in Jiaxing, and had been bitten by a rabid dog. The poison had taken effect. The shop owner said he would send him home, but he himself was from Taizhou. It is unknown why the shop owner bought a ticket to Songjiang. He had no choice but to get off the train. As he spoke, his speech became increasingly slurred. After a while, he made sounds like a dog barking. The station staff sent him to the Second Precinct Police Station, who transferred him to a hospital. The hospital refused to admit him due to the severity of his condition, so they reported to the County Public Security Bureau for instructions. He died of exhaustion around 2:00 AM.</p>

<p>Large Gang of Lake Bandits Discovered in Xinkai Road: After the bandits on Yangcheng Lake were annihilated by the bandit suppression forces, the bandits who remained on Taihu Lake also reportedly fled to Zhejiang Province, temporarily disappearing. However, yesterday (the 18th) at around 11:00 AM, a group of bandits, about 300 in number, in over 30 boats, fled from Zhejiang Province to Xinkai Road, about ten miles from Wujiang. They were armed with sophisticated weapons, intending to harass the area. The leader of the 14th team of the Wujiang Water Police, Huai Zongbang, discovered this, and telegraphed Gong, the district chief of the 3rd district in Suzhou, for instructions. After receiving the telegram, District Chief Gong ordered the captain of the guerrilla force, Fang Yue, to instruct the leader of the 1st team, Ji Zongxian, to lead his team to intercept them. At the same time, he telegraphed Captain Huai to cooperate with the Wujiang garrison nearby to suppress the bandits. He also telegraphed the Bandit Suppression Headquarters to Commander-in-Chief Hu, who in turn instructed Zhao Xiguang, the Bandit Suppression Commander of the Eastern District, to immediately dispatch a team to suppress and arrest the bandits.</p>
<p>Murder Case Transferred to Suzhou for Trial: Zhou Peihua, a set painter at the Dongwu Theater in the Northern District of Suzhou City, was targeted by Ma Yao, who slaughtered chickens and ducks for a living last autumn. Ma Yao, wanting to seize Zhou's wife, lured Zhou to Nanjing, killed him with a chicken and duck knife, and abandoned his body in the wilderness. The case was discovered, and Ma was arrested. After repeated trials by the Jiangning District Court, Ma was sentenced to death. Ma was not satisfied and hired lawyer Bao Ying to appeal to the High Court. After approval, the Jiangning District Court yesterday transferred Ma to Suzhou for trial.</p>
<p>Three Bandits Arrested in a Robbery Case in Zhuangshang Village: On the 12th of this month, more than ten bandits broke into the house of Sun Xiangfu in Zhuangshang Village, Hengjing Township, Suzhou, and robbed him at gunpoint. They burned Sun's wife's lower body with a candle. As a result, several hundred silver dollars' worth of clothing and other items were stolen. On the 14th, the director of the 3rd Precinct, Jiang Tingxie, went to investigate. He soon learned that Du Youqing's house in Wushe Sanjia Village was harboring the robbers. He immediately arrested Du Youqing and a suspect named Ren Qingcheng, and recovered two original stolen copper items. According to Du Youqing's confession, the robbers were Shi Longsheng, who lived near Kongjiatang Bridge, etc. On the 17th, the precinct sent patrol officer Yao Shuwei to arrest Shi. Shi resisted arrest and threw rocks at the patrol officer, breaking his head. The patrol officer then fired two shots, hitting Shi's leg, and he was subdued and taken to the precinct. He confessed that he had colluded with Du Youqing and over ten bandits from other provinces to commit the robbery. Yesterday (the 18th), Shi, Du, and Ren were all sent to the County Public Security Bureau for trial.</p>

<p>A Communist Party Headquarters is Cracked: Zhu Zhengguo, the captain of the county police force, led police officers disguised as workers and arrested two key communist party criminals, Gu Yasi (also known as Gu Asi and Guan Lanting) and Xu Zhiliang, at the Daxing Foundry in Tongxian Road the day before yesterday. They seized various reactionary propaganda materials and took the landlord, Ni Alai, and his wife, Ni Baoshi, into custody for questioning. They learned that Gu Yasi had also set up a headquarters in a house at No. 21, Yizheng Road. Captain Zhu immediately led the detective team leader, Liao Dajin, and a squad of soldiers to investigate. They arrested Hua Xixian (nicknamed Mr. Li) on the spot and seized two suitcases of reactionary propaganda materials, including a central plan for riots and provincial and county plans. There were also two tightly sealed newspapers. Upon inspection, they turned out to be lists of Communist Party members. Captain Zhu then took the criminals and evidence to interrogate them. Yesterday, he transferred the five suspects, Gu Yasi, Hua Xixian, Xu Zhiliang, Ni Alai, and Ni Baoshi, along with the reactionary propaganda materials, to the county for trial. Zhou, the investigating judge, opened the court for interrogation. Gu and Hua confessed to being fake Communist Party committee members and that the Communist Party had set up a reactionary organization in Wuxi with three fake committee members, planning to launch a large-scale riot on May 1st. Xu Zhiliang confessed that he had joined the Communist Party in Shanghai last year through an introduction from someone and came to Wuxi to engage in propaganda work, having distributed leaflets once. Ni Alai and his wife, Ni Baoshi, claimed that they had rented a room to Gu Yasi and denied any knowledge of secret meetings or joining the Communist Party. After the interrogation, Gu Yasi, Hua Xixian, Xu Zhiliang, and Ni Alai were ordered to be shackled and imprisoned. Ni Baoshi was sent to the detention center for custody, pending further investigation.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Propaganda Committee: The Wuxi Propaganda Committee, after two meetings convened by the county's propaganda department with representatives from various agencies, has passed the organizational regulations.

<p>Reassignment of District Chiefs and Police Officers in Dongxiang: Due to banditry in various districts of Tongyi Dongxiang, the district chiefs and chiefs of the public security bureaus have all fled. The county government and the public security bureau have uniformly reassigned Li Zemao and others to take office. Because the lurking bandits have not been cleared, the bureaus in each district are temporarily merged into one office.</p>

On the 15th of this month, Acting Director Gu originally intended to raise funds for half a month's salary, but because he was assigned to act temporarily, he was unwilling to take further responsibility. Therefore, all teachers and staff unanimously went on strike the day before yesterday, appealing to the education department to explain the difficulties and propose three conditions for resuming classes: (1) Before the colleagues resume their positions, the remaining half-month's salary for January and the full month's salary for February must be paid; (2) It must be guaranteed that at least the full month's salary for March will be paid before the traditional summer festival; (3) It must be guaranteed that after the March salary has been paid, the salaries for April, May, and June will be paid successively, with a maximum of one month's salary outstanding by the end of the semester. At the same time, the county magistrate was requested to urge the new director to take office quickly. Magistrate Chen replied that he had not received any notice of who the new director was and could not order him to take office based on a newspaper report. As for the remaining half-month's salary for January, the county government would raise the funds immediately.</p>

Although they have been severely suppressed by the army and police, they have fled from one place to another. Recently, these bandits have joined forces with the Big Sword Society bandits who fled from Anhui Province. There are now more than 4,000 of them, concentrated at Changqiao Checkpoint, northwest of Lincheng Bridge and bordering Sian. The city of Lincheng and Sian are very tense.

There are also rumors that Li Zizai, the director of the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, will be transferred to another position, and that he will be succeeded by the current Haiyan County Magistrate Yan Youfu.</p>
<p>Pessimism About Silk Cocoon Market in Western Zhejiang: The silk cocoon market in western Zhejiang is closely related to the silk production of the entire province. However, due to the irregular cold and warm weather this year, many young silkworms have suffered from early diseases. In addition, due to bandit activity, many farmers have abandoned sericulture. In previous years, silk cocoon merchants would compete to seize land and occupy the market, but this year they are hesitant due to the bandits and difficulties in transportation. Therefore, the prospects for the silk cocoon market in western Zhejiang this year are not optimistic.</p>

<p>Abolition of Flower Tax Collection Office: The Zhejiang Department of Finance previously established temporary collection offices in Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, and other places to collect flower taxes when cotton was on the market. Now that the cotton season has passed, these flower tax bureaus are temporary in nature and are no longer needed. They have been abolished to save expenses.</p>
<p>Early Silkworms Entering First Sleep Stage: Early silkworms in Xiaoshan have begun to enter their first sleep stage. The weather has been alternating between cold and hot, causing many to die. Mulberry leaves are expected to be priced at five yuan per dan. Leaf merchants have scheduled scales to open in twenty-five or six days. There are not many sericulturists in the four rural areas this year, so the leaf market is likely to decline.</p>

The level of each household will be investigated, reviewed, and registered by the Village and Li Committee and reported to the city government for verification and approval.</p>
<p>Public Cemetery Site Determined: The location of the Yongbo Municipal Cemetery was originally set at Dahe Bridge in Duan Tang. However, the area is too low-lying and unsuitable for building a cemetery. It is now known that the municipal health department has found a mulberry garden in Beibanhe that is suitable for use as a cemetery. However, the land area is only about three mu. Mayor Yang sent personnel to measure the land yesterday. If it is suitable, it will be transferred to municipal ownership and a cemetery will be built.</p>

Li Shouzhong's family also received a letter from the robbers yesterday, stating that they had not robbed them of 3,400 yuan and that their false report had damaged their reputation. They demanded that this amount be made up, or they would face severe consequences. All circles believe that the hidden bandits in the city are unscrupulous. A meeting was held at the Supplementary First Regiment Headquarters of the 45th Division, deciding that the Public Security Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Self-Defense Corps should jointly form an intelligence committee to investigate bandits. It was formed on the 12th to provide defense.</p>

<p>▲ Assembly Order: (1) Music and Opening Ceremony (Municipal Public Security Bureau Military Band), (2) Sing the Party Song, (3) Pay the Highest Respect to the Party and National Flag and the Portrait of the Premier, (4) Chairman Reads the Premier's Will Respectfully, (5) Silence, (6) Chairman's Report, (7) Speeches, (8) Proposals, (9) Slogans, (10) Adjournment.</p>
<p>▲ Chairman's Report: Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered the opening remarks, stating roughly: "Fellow comrades, today, representatives from all sectors of Shanghai have come here to hold a commemoration of the third anniversary of the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing. At the same time, we must also list the reactionary behaviors of the current reactionary warlords, such as Yan Xishan, and arouse everyone's attention to jointly condemn them. Our commemoration of the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing this time, especially in the current environment, when reactionary warlords and politicians are trying to establish a puppet government in Beiping, is particularly significant. We must encourage each other, consolidate the foundation of revolutionary forces, and strive to eliminate reactionary forces. Regarding the conspiracy to establish a puppet government in Beiping, we know that only Nanjing, historically, geographically, and culturally, is qualified to be the capital of the new China. The Premier's intention in designating Nanjing as the capital can be summarized in two points. First, Nanjing, from the perspective of Chinese history and culture, can very well represent the new vitality of China, can represent the spirit of the Chinese national revival, and can indicate the development of the Chinese revolutionary movement. Looking back in history, the national movements that occurred in Nanjing, not to mention the distant past, but just the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom decades ago, was the forerunner of the national revolution that our party is striving for. Although the actions of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom were only narrow nationalism, they also had considerable reforms in economy and politics. Especially from the standpoint of nationalism, advocating the revival of the Chinese nation, we should pay attention to the fact that they took Nanjing as their political center. Furthermore, recalling five or six hundred years ago, when we were under the severe oppression of the Mongol rule, the success of the Han Chinese revival movement was also based in Nanjing. This history of national revival, often represented by Nanjing, cannot be erased, nor can anyone deny it. Why did Nanjing become the representative of the forces of national revival? There are reasons for this. Because the times and culture are advancing. During the period of struggle between new and old forces, one side represents the old forces, and the other represents the new forces. The center of the old forces is in Beiping, which was formerly Beijing, and the center of the new forces is in Nanjing. The reason why the Premier designated Nanjing as the capital was to encourage everyone to support the new doctrine and new forces to overthrow the outdated, evil, and feudal forces, so that the construction of the new China could proceed smoothly. Second, we should understand that since the end of the Qing Dynasty and the reign of the Beiyang warlords of Yuan Shikai's lineage, the failures of various international negotiations have created a supreme government above the Chinese warlord government, which is the so-called Legation Quarter in Dongjiaomin Lane, Beijing. Originally, the foreign affairs of a country, such as the issues between China and Japan, only need to be directly negotiated between China and Japan, and the issues between China and Britain only need to be directly negotiated between China and Britain. This is a certain principle. China is not like this. If you want to negotiate with one country, it is because the imperialists have organized a united front and used unequal treaties to bind us. Regarding China's problems, when China wants to negotiate with one country, they will definitely unite and form a joint force. The so-called Legation Quarter, the so-called Legation Quarter of various countries in the Boxer Protocol, has always been accustomed to holding the Chinese Beiping government hostage. We want to abolish the treaties, but they insist on revising the treaties. The Northern Warlord government, until its demise, did not even achieve a single point of treaty revision. Therefore, this is because they are afraid of the supreme government. If our government is still located in Beiping, under the control of these imperialist forces, this joint force cannot be broken. There is simply no new hope. Just look at Yan Xishan and others who want to establish a puppet government in Beiping, but first have to send people to Dongjiaomin Lane to get the Legation Quarter to smooth things over, and you can imagine that they have surrendered to the imperialists. Therefore, the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing is the dawn of diplomacy. In the three years since the establishment of the Nanjing government, the diplomacy that has been conducted, even if there are places that cannot fully satisfy people, but from the perspective of not being coerced by the Legation Quarter, the first victory in diplomacy has already been achieved. From this perspective, the National Government's diplomatic actions have benefited from the establishment of the capital in Nanjing. Therefore, the Premier's designation of the capital in Nanjing is to break away from the control of imperialism. Domestically, we want to eliminate the decadent forces, the evil forces, and the feudal forces, to build a new China and develop the vitality of the nation. It is necessary to establish the capital in Nanjing. Externally, to break away from the coercion of the Legation Quarter, to break the shackles of imperialism, and to build a government of revolutionary diplomacy, it is also necessary to establish the capital in Nanjing. The Premier's designation of the capital, if scholars who study culture, history, and geography are asked to speak, they will definitely have many theories to support the Premier's proposal to designate Nanjing. Just from the above two points, we can already know how important the meaning of the Premier's designation of Nanjing as the capital is. It is indeed absolutely impermissible to violate it. If there are still people who advocate the establishment of a government in Beiping, no matter who is advocating it, they are undoubtedly reactionaries. That is, they do not want new development, they do not want the revival of the Chinese nation, and they are even the restoration of old ideas and old forces. Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, as everyone knows, are feudal remnants of warlords, who only pay attention to their personal rights and territories. Now they are conspiring to organize a government in Beiping. We can only pity their stupidity. However, there are still many reorganizers and Western Hills Conference faction members who still talk about the Party and the Premier, who, for their own selfish interests, have taken refuge under the wings of warlords and want to establish a puppet government in Beiping. Can they still say that they are not counter-revolutionaries? Can they still not be condemned? This is the most important first point in today's commemoration. Second, let us think about why the National Government wants to move the capital to Nanjing. When the Party army recovered Hunan, Hubei, and Wuhan, and Nanjing had not yet fallen, the National Government had to move to the Yangtze River basin in order to coordinate political and military command. At that time, when politics and military affairs were developing, unfortunately, those Communists, who joined the Party in their individual capacity, wanted to usurp the Party and poison China. The Party had to deal with the warlords on the one hand, to implement the purification of the Party on the other hand, to save China on the one hand, and even more so to save the Party. Therefore, it implemented the purification of the Party and moved the capital to Nanjing. Therefore, firstly, we think that the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing is still respecting the Premier's intention and has the significance of protecting the life of the Party and the vitality of the country. This is the first meaning of the commemoration. Today's commemoration is to be held once a year, and today is the third time. Why do we have this third commemoration? This is to allow us to review the work of the past three years to see if everything has been successful, which things have progressed quickly, which things have progressed slowly, and which things have not yet progressed. The Kuomintang's revolutionary movement is always forward-looking, but it does not mean that the platform of the Kuomintang's first national congress will be completed immediately after it is set. This is something that no one can do. Some people think that revolution should be like magic, changing in an instant. This is really a joke. With this illusion, they point out one or two points and create many shallow fallacies. As a result, people with weak wills are incited by them and unwittingly embark on the path of counter-revolution. Now, these reactionary elements, in addition to the warlords, are all inevitably based on this kind of erroneous idea. They do not know that with the vast land and large population of China, the completion of the revolution can only rely on the party's loyal leaders, inheriting the Premier's teachings, and leading the comrades of the whole party and the compatriots of the whole country, under the Three People's Principles, to first do the work of peaceful unification, stabilize and build China under the new forces, and take mutual trust and confidence as the foundation. Everyone recognizes that the purpose is correct, the motive is not mistaken, and they must enthusiastically do things and treat people with loyalty and forgiveness. We can use the Party's doctrine and platform as a measure to review past work. Today, we have advanced a few inches, and tomorrow, we have advanced a few feet. There is absolutely no reason to succeed overnight, and we must never scold, be indignant, be discouraged, or be romantic because we cannot see the emergence of a golden world. Young comrades should pay attention to cultivating their own physical and mental will. According to the Premier's will, encourage each other and do one part is one part. When we see doctrines and activities that are sufficient to endanger the survival of our nation and country, we must ruthlessly eliminate them. When we see rebellious elements that are sufficient to endanger the foundation of the Party and the country, we must support the Central Government to overthrow them. This is the attitude of comrades and this is the responsibility of citizens. This is the third meaning of today's commemoration. In short, firstly, moving the capital to Nanjing is based on the Premier's teachings; secondly, moving the capital to Nanjing is for the sake of saving the Party and saving the country; thirdly, commemorating the moving of the capital to Nanjing is to review the government's work with loyalty and forgiveness and to support the government's suppression of rebels. From this, we know that the actions of Yan Feng and the reorganizers, the Western Hills Conference faction, and other reactionary elements are completely against the Party, against the country, and against the Premier's teachings. They want to restore the old evil forces and are the sinners of the new China. Therefore, the representatives from all walks of life who attended the meeting today should tell this meaning to friends and relatives and let them all understand the wrongdoings of Yan Feng's rebellious behavior and the attitude we should take, only then can we truly commemorate the National Government establishing its capital in Nanjing. Next, Chen Guangyu from the Municipal Party Department gave a speech, details omitted.</p>
<p>▲ Assembly Proposals: There were two important proposals in the assembly: (1) To send a telegram supporting Chairman Chiang and eliminating the remaining warlords of Xiao Qing to complete the national revolution; (2) To send a telegram to the whole country to unanimously advocate suppressing Yan Feng. Both were unanimously passed by the assembly. The telegram was sent out on the same day. Details are as follows: (1) Telegram supporting Chairman Chiang and eliminating the remaining warlords of Xiao Qing, addressed to all newspapers, all levels of party departments throughout the country, all mass organizations, and overseas compatriots: "In recent years, the Party and the country have been unfortunate, and disasters have occurred frequently. Fortunately, thanks to the spirit of the Premier in heaven, the struggle of comrades, and the meritorious service of the soldiers, the Sun Wu warlords have been successively eliminated, and the Tang Zhang rebels have been exterminated, eliminating all corrupt elements. The people of the country are returning to the right path. The reactionary forces have been extinguished, and peaceful unification has been achieved. The political tutelage will begin from now on, the national revolution will be completed, recuperation will be carried out, and the country and the nation will be brought to a position of freedom and equality. How could it be known that Yan Xishan, who had received the grace of the Party and the country, dared to defy the great injustice of the world, advocating chaos, and holding the fallacious theory of propriety and concession as the state, coercing the Party and the country by having Chairman Chiang step down, secretly accepting the remnants of the shackles of the Anfu clique and the warlord rebels, and recruiting the Party and the country traitors of the reorganizers and the Western Hills Conference faction, regarding discipline as a mere formality, cruelly causing suffering to the people, regarding the Central Government as nothing, willingly becoming the head of the rebellion, and his reactionary behavior is extreme. Our Central Government is the Central Government for the welfare of the people, and our Chairman Chiang is the savior of the nation. Against this reactionary, we will now suppress him. To remove Qingfu is to make Lu safe. To destroy this feudal remnant is to complete the national revolution. At this time when the loyal and brave soldiers are working hard to kill the thieves in front, all the comrades and the entire people of this city are willing to uphold the revolutionary will of steadfastness and decisiveness and, together with all the comrades and compatriots of the whole country, unanimously support Chairman Chiang, quell this rebellion, and eliminate the remnants, and lay the foundation for peaceful unification forever. The national revolution will be completed. This telegram cannot express our extreme indignation." Shanghai All-Circles Celebration of the National Government Establishing its Capital in Nanjing Third Anniversary and Punish Yan Feng Two Rebels Propaganda Assembly. (2) Telegram to the whole country, unanimously advocating suppressing Yan Feng, addressed to all newspapers, all levels of party departments throughout the country, all mass organizations, and overseas compatriots: "Yan Xishan, as a mere soldier, occupied Shanxi, and maintained his army for self-respect. The Central Government, with the intention of pacifying the people and allowing the people to rest, did not suppress him, hoping that he would reform himself. However, Yan's warlord nature was ingrained, and his ambitions were difficult to restrain. He did not participate in the campaign to suppress the bandits and build meritorious service for the country. Recently, he openly allowed Feng to return to Tongguan and launched a rebellion. Our Party, adhering to the Premier's will, takes the elimination of warlords as its primary mission. How can we allow him to continue to linger in this way, plunging the people of the north into deep water and fire? Now, the order to suppress Yan Feng is about to be issued, and the army is about to be mobilized. It is foreseeable that the traitors and national thieves will soon be heading towards a path of rapid collapse. May the people of the Northwest be spared from the danger of deep water and fire and have the opportunity to see the light of day again. We still hope that everyone will rise up in unison and jointly suppress the rebellion. This is the fortune of the people of the Northwest, and also the fortune of the Party and the country's future."

<p>▲ Declaration to the Internal Public: "To All Citizens of the City, On the 16th of this month, the Western Ratepayers' Association overstepped its authority to discuss the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors in the Municipal Council for this year, and McDonald, a British lawyer from the law firm of Cradock &amp; Forbes (noting that this lawyer usually has the most Chinese clients), gave an arrogant speech. The Westerners present were incited by him, resulting in a rejection. All of us Chinese were deeply angered by this news. Our association convened an emergency meeting of representatives on the 17th and resolved to issue a formal declaration, confirming that the Western Ratepayers' Association has no right to discuss or decide on the civic rights that the Chinese ratepayers of the Public Settlement should have. Based on this principle, all rejections of the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors by the Western Ratepayers' Association are naturally invalid. We have also publicly appointed Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Hu Mengjia as representatives to petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate based on reason to achieve our goal. The entire process has been witnessed. We must remember that Shanghai is the territory of the Republic of China. Foreigners rely on their imperialist power and use inappropriate methods to seize various inappropriate rights. We are fighting for the freedom and equality of the Chinese nation. Our greatest effort and ultimate goal is to recover the settlements. Before this goal is achieved, distributing the seats of the Municipal Council directors according to the proportion of settlement taxes is a fair and reasonable proposition. Previously, in order to avoid possible difficulties, we compromised and took the first step of adding three Chinese directors and then increasing it to five Chinese directors. Unexpectedly, the Western Ratepayers' Association overstepped its authority to discuss it, and Western ratepayers, such as McDonald, continued to follow their stubborn old mindset and wantonly attacked it, resulting in a rejection. We have suffered this great humiliation and should more deeply understand that only by the success of our ultimate goal can we obtain a firm guarantee and enjoyment of our Chinese civic rights. The responsibility for the subsequent destruction of the sincerity between Chinese and foreign citizens in the settlements should be borne by the Western Ratepayers' Association. The facts are clear and cannot be concealed. In addition to striving to quickly realize our fair and reasonable demands, our association also hopes that all Chinese citizens in Shanghai will have a deep understanding, make the greatest efforts, be of one heart and one mind, always remember this, and seek the ultimate success on the right track. Where justice lies, we will not look elsewhere. We hereby declare this to quell the indignation." Shanghai Settlement Chinese Ratepayers' Association Declaration, April 18, 1920 of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: "To the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, on the day the association selected the Chinese directors of the Shanghai Public Settlement Municipal Council, the matter was reported for filing. Unexpectedly, on the same day, the Western Ratepayers' Annual Meeting overstepped its authority to discuss the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors in the Municipal Council by two, and the British lawyer McDonald gave an arrogant speech. The Westerners present were incited and blindly followed, resulting in a rejection. All Shanghai citizens were extremely indignant, and there was a tendency for swords to be drawn. In order to be cautious, the association convened an emergency meeting of representatives on the day after that and resolved to issue the following declaration: 'This association confirms that the Western ratepayers of the Shanghai Public Settlement have no right to discuss or decide on the civic rights that the Chinese ratepayers of the Public Settlement should have. Based on this principle, the rejection of the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors of the Municipal Council by two by the Western Ratepayers' Association on April 16 of this year is naturally invalid. We hereby solemnly declare this.' We have also publicly appointed Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Hu Mengjia as three representatives to come to the Ministry to petition for a fair and just resolution in foreign affairs. In addition to comforting the citizens to listen to the Ministry's handling of the matter and unanimously vowing to be the backing, we respectfully request the Ministry to negotiate based on reason to achieve our goal and comfort the expectations of all Chinese citizens in Shanghai. Do not delay the anticipation of awaiting orders. Furthermore, the occurrence of this issue has caused a rupture in the sincere cooperation between Chinese and foreign citizens in the Shanghai Public Settlement, and the Western Ratepayers should bear full responsibility for this. We hereby solemnly declare this. We hope you will understand." Shanghai Settlement Chinese Ratepayers' Association. ▲ Letter to the Three Representatives: "Dear Sirs, Regarding the Western Ratepayers' Association's overstepping of its authority to discuss and reject the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors at the emergency meeting of representatives of this association on the 17th of this month, it was resolved to issue a formal declaration based on the principle that the Western ratepayers of the Public Settlement have no right to discuss or decide on the civic rights that the Chinese ratepayers of the same area should have, considering it naturally invalid. Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Hu Mengjia have been publicly appointed as three representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, negotiate based on reason, and achieve our goal. In addition to recording the case and sending a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and separate letters, we hereby send this letter for your information and implementation. Do not delay our anticipation. This letter is addressed to Representative Wang Xiaolai, Representative Yu Qiaqing, and Representative Hu Mengjia."</p>
<p>▲ The Departure Date of the Three Representatives: It is heard that Representatives Yu, Wang, and Hu have prepared their luggage and have telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang, saying, "To Foreign Minister Wang of the Nanjing Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we have petitioned the Ministry regarding the increase in the number of Chinese directors. Will you be in Beijing on the appointed day? Please reply by telegram, Yu Hede, Wang Xiao, and Hu Mengjia." As soon as they receive Foreign Minister Wang's reply, they will immediately rush to the capital. If Foreign Minister Wang comes to Shanghai in the near future, the three representatives will personally present everything in Shanghai, it is said.</p>
<p>▲ Letter to Manager Wang: "To Mr. Edwards, Consultant Phayre, General Manager of the Public Settlement Municipal Council, Dear Sir, This association formally issued the following declaration on April 17, 1920, of the Republic of China (as seen above). We hereby send this letter for your information."</p>
<p>▲ Assistance from the French Settlement: "Dear Sir, After reading the newspaper, we learned that the Western Ratepayers' Association of the Public Settlement overstepped its authority and resolved to cancel the proposal to increase the number of Chinese directors attending the Municipal Council. We cannot help but feel indignant. After reading your association's declaration, we find it to be righteous and dignified and worthy of admiration. We ask that you continue your past fighting spirit until your goal is achieved. Our association vows to do its best to assist. We hereby send this letter for your information." Shanghai French Settlement Chinese Ratepayers' Association, April 18.</p>
<p>▲ Foreign Minister Wang's Declaration: Regarding the Shanghai Public Settlement Ratepayers' Association's rejection of the increase in the number of Chinese directors, Foreign Minister Wang declared on the 18th: "The Shanghai Public Settlement Ratepayers' Association has now resolved not to allow the increase in the number of Chinese directors. I am truly shocked. The increase in the number of Chinese directors was previously agreed upon. Now, disregarding faith and righteousness, the stubborn foreigners have prevailed. This is truly regrettable. I sincerely hope that unfortunate events will not occur as a result of this on the one hand, and on the other hand, I hope that foreigners who understand the situation can find a way to remedy the situation. Chinese taxpayers, based on the previous agreement, could have elected five Chinese directors, but now they have received such a rejection, I am afraid that serious consequences will occur and will certainly not be approved by the governments of the countries concerned."</p>
<p>▲ Fan Guangzhi's Congratulatory Telegram: The association received a telegram from Vice Minister Fan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, "To Chairman Wang of the Shanghai Settlement Chinese Ratepayers' Association Representative Assembly, and to Yu (Qiaqing), Xu (Xinliu), Bei (Songsun), Liu (Hongsheng), the five Chinese directors, and Lin (Kanghou), Qin (Runqing), Chen (Tingrui), Li (Fusun), Qian (Longzhang), and Wu (Yunqi), the six committee members, I am very happy to hear that you have been elected. The recovery of the settlements depends on your leadership. I respectfully send this telegram to congratulate you, Fan Guang."</p>
<p>▲ Convening the Executive Committee: The association sent a letter to all executive committee members yesterday, "Dear Sirs, We have scheduled the first plenary meeting of this year's executive committee for 2:00 PM on April 19 in the reception room of the Shanghai Merchant Guild Readjustment Committee. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby send this letter for your information. Please attend on time."</p>
<h3 id="e89">The Municipal Council Decides to Convene a Special Meeting <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>▲ New Trends in the Chinese Councilor Issue</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Chinese Councilors in the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the unfolding of the stalemate, the Municipal Council, based on its position, has now decided to convene a special meeting of Western ratepayers to re-submit the proposal to increase the number of Chinese Councilors for another vote. The British Consul-General, Mr. Brenan, and the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Shigemitsu, are currently</p>
<p>exerting all their efforts to bring this about, and some progress has been made. The information heard yesterday is compiled and recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The British Consul-General Expresses: According to Mr. Brenan, the British Consul-General, he will use all his influence to push for the passage of this proposal at the special meeting. This meeting is convened in accordance with Clause 15 of the Land Regulations of the International Settlement. A petition with the signatures of twenty-five ratepayers will soon be submitted to the Municipal Council. Whether this petition has already been signed by twenty-five people is not yet known, as Mr. Brenan is not directly involved. However, he expects it can be completed. The definite news will be available within a day or two.</p>
<p>▲ Shigemitsu Agrees to Mediate: Japanese Consul-General Shigemitsu Kōki, in the interest of promoting Sino-Japanese amity, has also agreed to do his best to mediate. Although yesterday was a holiday, Mr. Shigemitsu still invited Councilors Fukushima and Saito, as well as several other Japanese community leaders, to his residence to discuss remedial measures. After the meeting, he also used</p>
<p>his personal capacity to invite consuls from various countries and members of various boards to discuss remedial measures for this case, and stated that he was willing to sincerely act as a mediator so that this case could be resolved satisfactorily as soon as possible, without causing resentment among Chinese and foreigners. It is now heard that next Tuesday (the 22nd), consuls from various countries and members of the Municipal Council will accept Consul Shigemitsu's invitation for an informal meeting to discuss solutions in the spirit of personal friendship. In addition, Councilors Fukushima and Saito are also working to mediate.</p>
<p>▲ Decision to Convene a Special Meeting: The Municipal Council believes that convening a special meeting of Western ratepayers in accordance with Article 15 of the Land Regulations of the Yangjingbang is the only way to remedy this issue and has now decided to convene it immediately. The procedures for convening the special meeting were generally described in yesterday's newspaper. If it does not fail to meet quorum, the issue has a good chance of being resolved. The detailed regulations for convening the special meeting are as follows: A special meeting of Western ratepayers may be convened temporarily to discuss matters if deemed necessary by all consuls or at the suggestion of at least twenty-five electors (i.e., ratepayers). The meeting must be held ten days after notification, and the agenda must be clearly stated in the notification in advance. A quorum of one-third of the electors is required. However, electors who cannot attend in person may send representatives. All resolutions must be passed by a majority to be valid. The meeting will be chaired by the senior consul, and if he is absent, a chairman will be elected by a majority vote of the electors.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Wang Xiaoda Rescued from Danger <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>▲ Kidnap Victim Hidden in Dapu Bridge</p>
<p>▲ Brave Rescue by Detectives</p>
<p>▲ Kidnappers Fled Empty-Handed</p>
<p>▲ Wang Xiaoda Safe and Sound</p>
<p>The case of Wang Xiaoda, the third son of Shanghai gentleman Wang Binyan, who was kidnapped, was successfully solved last night when he was safely rescued by the Shanghai Municipal Police Detective Squad. The details of the breakthrough are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ After the Kidnapping: Since Wang Xiaoda was kidnapped by bandits on the 11th of this month at the intersection of Xinmin Road and Guoqing Road in Zhabei, there has been great concern from all sectors. The details at that time have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper and need not be repeated. However, since this case occurred, all sectors believe that if the son of the head of the local security organization, which is responsible for protecting local security, is kidnapped, one can imagine what might happen to others. Yuan Liang, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, paid special attention to this and issued an order to his subordinates to solve the case in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>▲ Location of the Bandits' Den: After Director Yuan issued the order, he especially summoned Lu Ying, the acting head of the Detective Squad, to encourage him to intensify the investigation. After receiving the order, Director Lu immediately ordered his subordinates to conduct a thorough investigation. Several days passed with no news. Unexpectedly, the night before last (the 17th), a confidential report stated that the bandits' den was located in a bungalow at No. 10 Chengzhili, Tanjiazhai, in the far western Chinese territory of Xujiahui. However, it was not certain whether the kidnap victim was inside. He was asked to quickly send officers to arrest the suspects. After receiving the report, Director Lu immediately assembled more than twenty officers, personally led them, equipped with weapons, and first went to the Second Precinct of the Sixth District to meet with the chief police officer. They rushed there at night. ▲ Where the Kidnap Victim Was Hidden: When they arrived at Tanjiazhai, it was not yet dawn, and they could not distinguish east from west. Director Lu then led the officers to crawl through the nearby wilderness and fields, waiting for dawn. When the east turned slightly white, he ordered the house to be surrounded first, and he took the lead in rushing in. However, the house was empty, with no one inside. After a detailed inspection, many clues were found, indicating that the bandits had three hideouts and had already moved elsewhere. He then led the officers back to the team and intensified the investigation. It was then discovered in the afternoon (yesterday) that the location where the kidnap victim was hidden was in a house at No. 5 Yongdeli, Dapu Bridge West, Xujiahui Road, within the French Concession. At about 6:00 p.m. that evening, Director Lu personally led detectives Qi Haitian, Han Ruisheng, Zhang Guangsen, Wang Peiwen, Ding Shunqi, Zhou Peisan, He Haifa, Shan Bin, Han Jingxiang, Hou Shenghan, Zhang Yingpin, etc., to make the arrest.</p>
<p>▲ Like Obtaining a Treasure: Director Lu led the officers in several cars and first reported to the special agency of the French Police. At the same time, he ordered Detective Ding Shunbao to first rush to check on the house at No. 5 to facilitate an immediate rush in to avoid searching for it at the last minute. When they arrived at Yongdeli, they saw a single-story Shikumen house at No. 5. However, the upstairs and downstairs were dimly lit. At the same time, Director Lu and Chinese and Western detectives from the French Police arrived one after another. They rushed in together, directly rushing upstairs. The house was empty. When they searched the room on the overhead bridge on the second floor, they caught a glimpse of a person wearing a black short jacket lying on a couch, with a lamp dimly lit on the wall. The detectives went forward and pressed him down. Upon closer inspection, it was none other than the kidnap victim Wang Xiaoda. The detectives were as if they had obtained a treasure.</p>
<p>▲ Danger of Being Killed: After Director Lu rescued the kidnap victim, he ordered a search of the entire house, but it was empty. When he asked the kidnap victim, he said that he had heard the news and fled. He first brought the kidnap victim into the police station and asked him a few questions. Then Director Lu personally led the team and immediately notified the family by telephone. His father, Wang Binyan, rushed over upon hearing the news and deeply thanked the detectives for their effective rescue. According to Wang Xiaoda, he was taken directly to that place after being kidnapped and was initially hidden in the attic, where he ate very coarse food. He was only moved to the overhead bridge room yesterday morning. So far, he has not been mistreated. There were eight or nine people guarding him, taking turns. The bandit leader spoke with a Jiangbei accent, wore a Zhigong woolen mandarin jacket and a woolen hat, and was neatly dressed, looking like a businessman. As of yesterday morning, the bandits suddenly gathered to discuss privately, saying that if there were no results today (yesterday), they would definitely kill him that night. After finishing, he was personally led back by his father. Director Yuan was very pleased to hear the news and planned to reward the officers who contributed, depending on their merits.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Public Concession Intensifies Precautions Against Western Shanghai <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>▲ Armed Police Search Pedestrians</p>
<p>▲ Trams and Cars Also Not Exempt</p>
<p>The Chief Inspector of the Shanghai Municipal Police in the Public Concession, due to the recent frequent occurrences of robberies and kidnappings in various places, especially in the western Shanghai area, where workers are mixed and of mixed quality, has ordered the Jing'an Temple and Gordon Road police stations to strengthen precautions. Yesterday afternoon, at about 5:00 p.m., the Jing'an Temple police station dispatched a Western police officer, leading two Japanese police officers and six Chinese police officers, all wearing iron vests and carrying live ammunition pistols, to go to Jessfield Road, Brenan Road, Yu Yuen Road, etc., to conduct random searches. All pedestrians, vehicles, public buses and trams were required to temporarily stop for a thorough search. The security measures were extremely strict and only withdrawn in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e93">A Haggard Young Man Dies Tragically in the Oriental Hotel <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>▲ Checks into Hotel Alone ▲ Looks Like an Ill Person</p>
<p>▲ Suddenly Takes Poison Late at Night ▲ Cause Not Understood</p>
<p>The Oriental Hotel at the intersection of Hankou Road and Zhejiang Road received a guest around 7:00 p.m. the day before yesterday. He was wearing a dark blue serge jacket, black serge trousers, white socks, and gabardine shoes. He registered as Chen Zhenchu, 24 years old, from Hangzhou, and worked in the Western medicine business. He stayed in room 104 on the ground floor of the hotel and did not have a meal. He looked haggard, rather like someone newly recovered from a long illness, and the tea room did not pay much attention to him. After Chen Zhenchu closed the door, he stayed inside for a long time. Around midnight, he rang the bell to consult the tea room, saying, "I have something to do tomorrow and need to be woken up at 9:00 a.m." The tea room attendant replied politely, and Chen closed the door and went to sleep. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 a.m. yesterday, the attendant went to room 104 to call him as agreed and called out loudly at the door. After several calls, there was no response, presumably because he was sleeping soundly. He knocked on the door, making a loud noise, but there was still no movement. Feeling suspicious, he reported to the accounts room. The manager, upon hearing the news, thought that there had been many suicides in hotels recently, and this gentleman was probably no exception. He urgently ordered the door to be pried open. They saw Chen Zhenchu lying stiffly on the bed, his eyes rolled back, his mouth open, and his hands and feet still slightly moving. They also saw an empty bottle of sedative medicine on the table, a piece of cigarette paper, and a little sorghum wine. The tea room attendants knew that he had taken poison. They immediately reported to the Old Gate police station. The police chief immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. When they arrived at the hotel, they saw that Chen was already dying. They searched his body but found nothing of value. He was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was determined that he had taken too much poison and could not be saved. He died shortly afterward. It was decided to send him to the forensic examination center on Faelan Road this morning for an autopsy.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Luo Qingfen Accuses Zhang Wenzheng of Bigamy <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>▲ Sweet Words at the Time of Engagement</p>
<p>▲ Landed Property, Never Had a Wife</p>
<p>▲ After Marriage, Came to Shanghai, Treated Like a Stranger</p>
<p>▲ Only After an Investigation Did She Realize She Was Deceived</p>
<p>Zhang Wenzheng (also known as Zhang Yunqing) from Nanxiang, formerly married Luo Qingfen as his wife, is now being sued by Luo through lawyer Wang Shizong for bigamy. The court hearing took place at the Special District Local Court. Judge Wu presided over the hearing the day before yesterday. The defendant, Zhang Wenzheng, did not appear. According to Luo's claim, she is 26 years old and originally from Shaoxing. She married Zhang on the 21st day of the first month of last year. The matchmaker was Wang Abao. After marriage, they lived together in Huashunli, Tongfu Road. At the time of the engagement, the defendant claimed that he was a compradore in Ander Yiyang, had landed property, and had never had a wife. Therefore, in the third month after the marriage, she accompanied him back to the old house in Hualiu Stone, Nanxiang, stayed for about a week, and then came back to Shanghai. Then the defendant suddenly stopped coming to my house and did not provide support. Last December, I gave birth to a son. I informed the defendant, but he ignored it, treating me like a stranger. Later, after investigation, I learned that the defendant had a wife at No. 1112 Xinpingli, Yanlongmen Road. The defendant has committed bigamy and I request punishment. Then the officer who served the subpoena reported that he went to Xinpingli to summon the defendant. The second landlord of the house said that there was a tenant named Zhang, but he was not named Wenzheng or Yunqing, so he could not be served. Judge Wu adjourned the case, instructing the plaintiff to cooperate with the bailiff to summon the defendant to court for further investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Female Worker Is Competitive</p>
<p>▲ Provoked by a Coppersmith's Words</p>
<p>▲ Installing a Belt on a Motor</p>
<p>▲ A Tragedy Occurs</p>
<p>Shen Sigen from Shenjiazhai, west of Xinjing Town in northwestern Shanghai, married Du Xiamao's sister, Xinying (i.e., Shen Du, 25 years old), who ran a steamed bun shop in Beixinjing, three years ago. She had been a female worker in the cloth machine room of Toyota Textile Mill in Zhoujiaqiao for eight years. On the afternoon of the 16th, at 4:30 p.m., Xinying was working in the factory when the belt suddenly fell off. A coppersmith in the same room jokingly said to Xinying, "If you can install the belt on the motor, I will admire you." Xinying, in a moment of competitiveness, installed the belt on the motor. Unexpectedly, at that time, the wheel was spinning very fast, and it caught Xinying's hair. In an instant, her whole body was lifted up. By the time she was rescued,</p>
<p>both of her hands were broken, and her neck and chest were severely injured, with blood and flesh blurred, a truly tragic sight. She was rushed to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but her injuries were too severe, and she died at 7:00 p.m. that evening. Because the weather is getting hotter, the family first collected the body and is asking the factory for compensation and severely punishing the coppersmith while reporting to the local Party branch and Municipal Councilor Chen Ya-fu, requesting assistance.</p>

After the Wusong Changguan customs officer of the Jianghai Customs went to inspect the boat, the Cuisheng Fish Shop immediately set off firecrackers and hung red banners to start the weighing process as usual. The price was twelve catties per scale (i.e., twelve catties of spring fish sold for one yuan, according to last year's opening price of fourteen catties per scale). After receiving the news, general fish merchants from the surrounding areas rushed to Cuisheng to buy fish and transport them to various places for sale. By about 7:00 p.m. yesterday, the entire boat of fish had been sold out.

<h3 id="e98">Police Officer Colludes with Former Inspector to Defraud Money <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>▲ On the Pretense of Introducing Business</p>
<p>▲ Defrauding Small Workers of 900 Yuan</p>
<p>Wu Guisheng, a Chinese police officer No. 416 of the French Police, colluded with Yao Shousong, a former inspector of the Great World, last month, and used fraudulent means, on the pretext of recommending business, to defraud Yu Caikang, Jiang Hongliang, Hou Gaohui, Qi Fenggui, Tang Luchang, Chen Wanshan, Ma Zhengyuan, Ma Deyuan, and other eighteen people of 900 yuan in silver dollars. Later, Yu and others discovered the fraud and reported it to the French Police, who ordered detectives to arrest Yao alone. Wu Guisheng, the police officer No. 416, had already fled upon hearing the news. The police station sent Yao to the French Public Court for investigation the day before yesterday. The plaintiffs Yu Caikang and others all stated that they had always made a living doing odd jobs. Previously, police officer No. 416 said to them that the Great World was recruiting staff, and</p>
<p>he could ask Yao Shousong to help them get in. They believed it to be true and each paid 50 yuan, gathering over 900 yuan and inviting Yao Shousong to a feast at the Sanhe Lou restaurant. The plaintiffs handed over the money to police officer No. 416, who then handed it over to Yao Shousong. Unexpectedly, the defendants repeatedly delayed and disappeared. Therefore, they were forced to report to the police station and arrest Yao. The money of the plaintiffs was all borrowed from others. They requested a strict investigation. When Yao Shousong was questioned, his lawyer defended him, saying that although the defendant was present at the feast, he did not mention the matter of recommending business, nor did he receive the money from No. 416. He was falsely accused and requested a clear investigation. The Chinese and Western officials ordered Yao to pay 400 yuan for bail and be released, pending further investigation.</p>

<p>▲ French Minister Maraud to Take Post as Ambassador to Japan Next Month</p>
<p>The Sino-French Vietnam Trade Agreement, which has been stalled for a long time, was rumored last week to have hopes of being signed soon. It was said that because the French Minister Maraud saw that our Commissioner Zhang Weihan was about to return to Guangdong, he specifically sent a note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>expressing his sincerity in signing the agreement, but he did not specify the date of his southward journey. According to news from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, there is absolutely no hope of signing the trade agreement in the near future. The French Minister knows that our side will find it difficult to accept the conditions he has attached, so he is being mysterious and using it as an excuse to delay. It is also heard that the French Minister has decided to leave for Japan in early May to take up his post as ambassador. Therefore, the signing of a new agreement between the two sides will have to wait until the new French Minister Verdun arrives before negotiations can be held.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed Suzhou Provincial Government yesterday to support the Suzhou Provincial Government's reduction of administrative expenses of various agencies, and requested the abolition of various petty miscellaneous taxes within the scope. The telegram stated: "Zhenjiang Provincial Government, having read the report that the Second Eighty-Fourth meeting of your government resolved to reduce the expenses of various agencies, divided into six items, a total reduction in monthly expenditure of 115,801 yuan, an annual reduction in expenditure of 1,389,612 yuan. The thrifty movement should start from above, and the provincial government has reduced its expenses even more, in line with the principle of setting an example. Since the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, the financial resources of the southeast have supported the overall situation, but the resources have been exhausted. In addition, the disasters and famines of recent years, and the rampant lake bandits, have spread throughout the villages and towns, and farmers and merchants are struggling. The people's yearning for recuperation and recovery is entrusted to the authorities, believing that this is the only way to revitalize the situation. The orders and proclamations are praised, and the people are hopeful. We hope that your government will have the determination to clarify the situation and abolish petty miscellaneous taxes within the scope of provincial taxes, so that even thatched huts can benefit, and with sufficient food and clothing, the sources of chaos will be suppressed. This is the first key to governing the country today. In addition to our gratitude and comfort, we offer our humble opinion, hoping that you will not abandon it and adopt it. We would be greatly honored. The Shanghai Special Municipality Businessmen's Organization Rectification Committee bows and salutes."</p>

<p>▲ Magistrate Leng Promises to Allocate 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The branch directors of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, because the police pay has been in arrears for more than three months, the food of the police officers has been cut off, and they are clamoring every day. The stores are demanding the payment of debts, so they are unable to maintain it. Yesterday, they gathered in the city and appealed to the head office to demand payment. Shen Zhenhua, the director of the bureau, had no choice but to go to the County Government with them at noon to see Magistrate Leng. Yesterday also happened to be the anniversary of the establishment of the capital, and the office was closed. Therefore, they went to Magistrate Leng's residence in the French Concession to present the situation in person and demand a real remedy. As a result, Leng ordered the Finance Bureau to allocate 2,000 yuan of the financial aid from the Department of Finance in advance for distribution to maintain the current situation temporarily, and then discuss a fundamental solution.

<p>▲ Hopes for Development in Sino-Japanese Trade</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Japanese Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai held its general meeting at the Japanese Club last night (the 17th). Thirty-two leading figures from the business community attended. Chairman Mr. Miri reported on the Chamber's work over the past year and the political and commercial situation in China. He stated that although the situation in China was still unstable last year, the total foreign trade reached 242.5 million taels, an increase of 23.9 million taels compared to 1928 and 49.5 million taels compared to 1927. However, the total Sino-Japanese trade volume was only 90.09 million Japanese yen.</p>
<p>, a decrease of 16 million Japanese yen compared to 1928. Furthermore, last year's total value of Chinese imports was 129.8 million taels, and the total value of exports was 112.7 million taels (i.e., an import surplus of 17.1 million taels). The total value of imports from Japan was 53.2 million Japanese yen, and exports were 37.7 million Japanese yen. (Translator's note: Last year's trade deficit with Japan was 15.5 million Japanese yen, equivalent to about 12.3 million silver taels, accounting for more than one-third of the total foreign trade deficit. The value of imports from Japan accounted for about one-third of the total foreign imports, while the value of exports accounted for more than one-quarter of the total exports.) The Sino-Japanese tariff agreement is expected to be approved soon, and the issue of consular jurisdiction is also expected to be resolved peacefully shortly. The gradual restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations should greatly contribute to the development of trade between the two countries, etc. Subsequently, new officers were elected and the meeting adjourned. As a result, Mr. Miri (Nissin Company) was re-elected as chairman, and Mr. Sakurakawa (Mitsubishi Company) was elected as vice-chairman.</p>

<p>▲ Died from Gunshot Wounds While Bravely Capturing Thieves</p>
<p>▲ Municipal Government Public Safety Bureau Awards Plaque</p>
<p>On March 2nd of this year at 8:15 PM, Ren Ruqi's family at No. 1 Dongshengli, Tangjiawan, in this city, was targeted for robbery and kidnapping. Zhang Rutong, a nearby resident, heard the commotion outside and mistakenly thought it was a fire. He went out to investigate, discovered it was a robbery, bravely pursued the thieves relentlessly, and was shot and killed by the thieves. As a result, the kidnapped young child of the Ren family was abandoned and safely rescued. The Municipal Public Safety Bureau, recognizing the deceased's profound sense of neighborly concern and selfless rescue efforts, commendable and respectable bravery, awarded a plaque inscribed with the four characters "Martyr for Justice, Forgetting Self," and raised one hundred yuan for consolation. It also obtained approval from the Municipal Government to award a plaque inscribed with the four characters "Commendable Righteous Courage" to serve as an example and promote awareness.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Foreign Press Commentary on China's Postal Service <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The English "Financial and Commercial News" of March 19th of this year commented on China's postal service. Excerpts are translated below for reference. On March 15th of this year, the new organization specializing in postal financial affairs (Postal Savings and Remittances General Bureau) held its opening ceremony presided over by the Minister of Communications. Thus, the postal savings and remittance business is formally separated from ordinary postal delivery services. This reform follows the established practices of development policies in various countries and is expected to benefit all parties. This approach allows the original Post Office General Bureau to focus on postal matters, while simultaneously establishing the Postal Savings and Remittances General Bureau to promote savings and enable the public to save small amounts of money through this new institution. Most notably, on the opening day of the Postal Savings and Remittances General Bureau, over one thousand new accounts were opened under the name of the new bureau. This is truly a good omen. It is heard that the General Bureau has over two thousand one hundred and twenty-five branches located throughout the country. In discussing postal matters, one is reminded of a clearly visible source of income mentioned in this newspaper before, which is substantial and does not cause significant harm to individuals or groups. However, the Chinese government has apparently not paid attention to it, namely that China's postal rates are too low. Currently, the postage for a local letter within China is only one silver cent, which, based on the current silver price, is only equivalent to 0.00175 of a penny. The postage for a letter sent to any location within China thousands of miles away is only four silver cents, less than three farthings. These rates are far lower than those of other countries and could be slightly increased. This would not hinder anyone and would greatly benefit government revenue. If the Chinese authorities adopt and implement this suggestion, we will inevitably be criticized by those less virtuous than ourselves. However, we know that this proposal is honest and selfless, and we can use this as an argument against criticism. Furthermore, it should be noted that our proposal is only to slightly increase postal rates.</p>

<p>It has already been announced that Chinese citizens traveling to India must have their passports endorsed by the British Consulate. It is now learned that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a letter from the British Embassy stating that Chinese citizens traveling to Burma for business or tourism must also hold passports endorsed by the British Consulate before they can proceed.

<p>▲ Reply from the Municipal Government to the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The Municipal Government replied to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday, stating: "Previously, we received a letter from your association regarding five resolutions of the Municipal Government submitted by the Sixth District Party Headquarters, concerning the Fourth District Representative Assembly, requesting review and reply. The relevant bureaus were instructed to review and reply, and a response was sent to your association. Now, according to the Social Affairs Bureau's report, we have copied and issued the original case of unifying rice industry organizations, instructing investigation and reporting. Upon investigation, we find that regarding item (A) of the original resolution, concerning the abolition of organizations of brokers, factories, shops, and sales agents, and the formation of a 'Grain Industry Association,' the Municipal Commercial Organization Reorganization Committee has already been separately merging and reorganizing them in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial and Commercial Trade Association Law. Once the reorganization is completed, unification will be achieved naturally. Regarding item (B), concerning the abolition of the dou and hu measurement system and the universal adoption of weight measurement, the rice industry's import and export have traditionally used the dou and hu system due to custom, which naturally has its drawbacks. However, forcibly changing to weight measurement at once is not a fundamental solution. Currently, the national weights and measures are being reorganized. The Bureau, in conjunction with the Public Utilities Bureau, has formulated a plan for uniform weights and measures in the city, which has been submitted to the Municipal Government and reported to the Ministry for record. Unification can be expected soon. Furthermore, regarding item (C), concerning the elimination of all improper benefits such as rebates, hu commissions, and transportation subsidies, except for the prescribed commissions for brokers and sales agents, the Bureau has dispatched personnel to investigate rice industry organizations. According to the industry leader Lu Wenshao, the industry originally had no regulations on rebates, hu commissions, or transportation subsidies, which were mostly created secretly by rice merchants from various places at the end of the year when they were eager to settle accounts and return home. If rice merchants can restrain themselves, this type of irregularity can be easily reformed." Based on the aforementioned reasons, the report is submitted for review and referral. In addition to the instructions, this letter is hereby sent for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Three Measures for Managing Traditional Chinese Medicine <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>▲ Proclamation by the Municipal Health Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau issued a proclamation yesterday to announce the measures for managing traditional Chinese medicine, stating: "For the purpose of proclamation, pursuant to Shanghai Special Municipal Government Instruction No. 4056, approving the Ministry of Health's reply, which was submitted to the National Government for approval, regarding the joint report by the Ministries of Health and Education on the proposed measures for managing traditional Chinese medicine, a copy of the original report is enclosed for your information and compliance. In addition to issuing separate instructions to the Bureau of Education, you are hereby ordered to comply accordingly." Also, an order was received from the Ministry of Health for the same reason. Therefore, a summary of the regulations outlined in the enclosed original report is hereby proclaimed for general knowledge. The proclamation states: (1) Societies aimed at studying traditional Chinese medicine should be called Chinese Medicine Academic Societies, so as to become academic organizations. This measure is to exclude traditional Chinese medicine from the school system, but to allow traditional Chinese medicine to develop freely, without being restricted by educational regulations. In the future, the research of Chinese Medicine Academic Societies will become a precise and systematic theory, and schools will compete to adopt it, without needing to rush to establish schools at present. (2) Traditional Chinese medicine practitioners who do not understand the use of Western instruments and do not know how to sterilize are not allowed to use Western instruments to avoid danger. For example, although traditional Chinese medicine practitioners are allowed to use thermometers, they must be strictly disinfected before being used on others when measuring a patient's temperature, otherwise infectious diseases such as diphtheria and tuberculosis can be transmitted at any time, which is very dangerous. (3) Premises set up by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners to accommodate patients may be called hospitals only if they understand sterilization methods, comply with the regulations for managing hospitals, and have a considerable scale and equipment. The purpose of establishing hospitals is to concentrate patients. If patients are gathered in one hospital and the hospital managers have no knowledge of sterilization, the danger is unspeakable when an acute infectious disease occurs.</p>

<p>▲ Colleagues from the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway See Him Off at the Riverfront</p>
<p>Yuan Shaochang, the former Deputy Chief of Traffic of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, has served the railway for nineteen years. He started as a trainee station master and was promoted to the position of Chief under the favor of his superiors. During his tenure, he maintained harmony between superiors and subordinates. Although he was under the economic aggression of British imperialism, he was neither arrogant nor humble in his dealings with foreigners on official matters. He was especially meticulous in protecting his Chinese subordinates. Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways is currently reorganizing the Pinghan Railway and urgently needs talent. Mr. Yuan's performance throughout his career has been excellent, so he was promoted to Chief of Traffic of the Pinghan Railway to assist in the reorganization. When his colleagues at the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway first heard the Ministry's order, they planned to jointly telegraph the Ministry to retract the order. However, because Mr. Yuan was being promoted, it was inappropriate to forcibly retain him. All colleagues felt reluctant to part with him. Mr. Yuan departed for his new post in Hankou on the Taikoo Company's Wusong ship last night. More than a hundred staff members of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway went to the port to see him off, and even station workers went in groups to send him off, demonstrating Mr. Yuan's popularity among railway workers.</p>

<p>▲ An Amusing Incident During the Wedding Feast</p>
<p>A Ningbo man surnamed Zhou, who resides at the southern end of Dongchang Road in Pudong, was celebrating his son's wedding the other day. As a result, his relatives and friends were seated to capacity. Unexpectedly, a well-dressed young woman was also drinking at the table. The young woman then took the little girl of Yao Xu, who was sitting next to her, to play with. Ms. Xu did not suspect anything because she thought the woman was also a wedding guest. Unexpectedly, the young woman cut off a gold lock pendant that the little girl was wearing with scissors. After the deed, she returned the little girl. At that time, the girl's parents had not yet noticed. Soon after, the young woman removed a small gold ring from the hand of Mr. Chen's son, another guest. However, the operation was not done discreetly and was spotted by another female guest surnamed Shen. She immediately grabbed the young woman and questioned her background, but her answers were all false. The other female guests at the table were enraged and slapped her in the face. The young woman's face turned red, and she knelt on the ground begging for mercy. She was then taken to the Third District Public Safety Bureau. After inspecting the young woman, the district chief found that she was dressed luxuriously and wore two sets of gold jewelry inside and out. He could not believe that she would resort to such low means. He interrogated her, and she confessed that her name was Chen Wang, she was thirty-two years old, and she lived in Zhangjiatang, Yu Family Temple, Pudong. She worked in the British-American Tobacco Company's Third Factory. The rest of her words were evasive. The district chief ordered her to be detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>▲ Took Poison Out of Anger</p>
<p>A woman named Shen Zheng, who resides at No. 66 half door plate of Fujian Road, makes a living by washing clothes. The other day, she went out after hanging up the washed clothes to dry. Unexpectedly, it suddenly rained. Upon returning home, she saw that the clothes were all soaked. She scolded her foster daughter Yang Wenkui, saying that she should not have stood idly by. The girl, who was already eighteen years old, was very proud. She was scolded and became disobedient. Out of anger, she swallowed opium paste. By the time Ms. Shen realized it, she had already been deeply poisoned. Although she was sent to the hospital, there was no way to save her. She died the other day. Upon receiving the report, the Old Gate Police Station sent detectives to transport the body to the burial parlor on Fielun Road.

<p>▲ Living Together Privately with a Patron</p>
<p>▲ Lured Back by the Brothel Owner and Others</p>
<p>Zhu Changlin from Liyang died of illness in his hometown the year before last. Because his wife had difficulty making a living due to poverty, she brought her daughter Caiying to Shanghai. At that time, the girl was just of age. Although she was a village girl, she was quite beautiful. Zhu's wife pawned her to the Zhihua brothel at No. 505 Fuxiang Lane, Hankou Road, for three years, receiving a pawn fee of sixty yuan per year. The brothel owner Weng Ding initially ordered her to lure lustful men at various entertainment venues. The girl was only able to lure people in that way. In December of last year, she met a young man from Hangzhou named Zhong Hongbi, who opened the Datong Bicycle Shop at No. 248 Wuding Road. Zhu learned that Zhong was still unmarried and quite sincere, so she decided to turn over a new leaf. She asked Zhong to pull her out of the mire. Zhong agreed. The girl was eager to leave the brothel as soon as possible, so she did not wait for the brothel owner's permission and followed Hongfu's elopement. Since the girl disappeared, the brothel owner sent out detectives to search for her. It was not until the other day that she learned that she was living together with Zhong. She immediately gathered her nephew Weng Heshang, Chen Ganqing, Yan Hesheng, Xi Yunzhou, and others, and went to Wuding Road, and by using trickery managed to lured the Zhu girl out. They hired a rickshaw and planned to bring her back to the brothel. Midway, the girl screamed loudly. Officer Wang Youshan of the Gordon Road Police Station happened to pass by and inquired about the situation. They were all taken to the police station the other day and transferred to the Special District Local Court. Judge Sun Yuan questioned Zhu Caiying about her experience of turning over a new leaf and requested the judge to fulfill her wish so that she and Zhong could become a couple. Zhong also came to the court and stated that he was willing to grow old together. The defendants hired lawyer Fan Gang and requested bail. Judge Sun instructed the defendants to each pay 500 yuan in bail and adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>

<p>▲ Two Women and One Man: Two Dead, One in Critical Condition</p>
<p>▲ A Couple Quarreled: Shen Mingzhao, a 41-year-old Ningbo native, lives at No. 200 Shanqing Lane, Aierjin Road. He runs the Shen Mingji Tobacco Leaf Shop. His wife, Guo, is 27 years old. She likes to play mahjong all day and all night, neglecting her housework. Yesterday, Shen scolded her slightly. She harbored resentment and secretly swallowed raw tobacco in an attempt to commit suicide. She was discovered and taken to Tongren Hospital, then transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Because too much time had passed, her life is in danger.</p>
<p>▲ Difficulties in Livelihood: Chen Zhongxian, a 28-year-old local resident, lives at No. 427 Fangbang Bridge, West Gate. Because he has been unemployed for several years and has difficulty making a living, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. Yesterday, he secretly swallowed opium paste. This morning, his grandfather discovered him and ordered someone to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Because the poison had already attacked his heart, he died at around 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>▲ Angered by Her Husband's Scolding: Dong Agen, a 25-year-old Cantonese native, lives at No. 98 Tongchun Lane, Gongping Road.

Someone entered the room to check on her and saw her moaning in bed, looking pale. They immediately hired a streetcar to take her to Tongren Hospital.

<p>▲ Tragic News of Zhou A'shan's Suicide by Slitting His Throat</p>
<p>Zhou A'shan, a lane sweeper in Dingxing Lane, North Sichuan Road, was 47 years old and from Ningbo. He lived at No. 27 in the lane and earned 15 yuan a month. He had a wife and two children, all of whom depended on Zhou's labor for a meager living. In Shanghai, where the cost of living is high, this was hardly enough to support a family of four, leading to increasing financial hardship and no possibility of borrowing. While they could barely manage in ordinary times, the price of rice rose sharply this year, and with a large appetite to feed, buying rice alone was difficult, let alone the seven necessities of life, all of which required money. Zhou A'shan was in such a state of desperation that he contemplated death. Yesterday morning, after getting up, Zhou, not wanting to neglect his duties, swept the lane clean. It was already eight o'clock. Upon returning home, he found their food supply exhausted and his pockets empty. Feeling despondent, he took out his own razor to trim his beard. Unexpectedly, before he could trim his beard, he turned the razor on his neck and slit his throat, severing his windpipe. He immediately fell to the ground and died.</p>
<p>His wife, Cao, tried to save him, but it was too late. She wailed and cried out in despair. Neighbors came to investigate and, upon understanding the situation, reported it to the police. The police in turn reported it to the First Precinct of the Fifth District, who ordered the local neighborhood head to report it to the local court for inspection. The prosecutor arrived at the scene and confirmed that it was a suicide. He instructed the family to arrange for the burial.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Case of Privately Trafficking Copper Coins <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>▲ Three Cases in One Day</p>
<p>Since the price of copper coins varies in different parts of the country, some people transport copper coins from one place to another, or even to a third place, profiting from the price differences. They consider this to be a lucrative business. However, customs officials are very strict in their searches, but these people are adept at concealing their contraband, making it difficult to detect. In the past two days, a total of three cases were uncovered: two involving smuggling out and one involving smuggling in. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>▲ Smuggling Out (1) The day before yesterday, at 1:45 PM, near the outer barrier of the Suzhou steamer at the Huatong Wharf in Pudong, a boat approached and docked alongside the steamer. Two passengers on board had upper bodies that were noticeably bulging in both the front and back, a shape that was quite comical. A patrolling water police officer noticed this and, suspecting something amiss, approached and unbuttoned the passengers' coats. He found that they were covered in layers of copper coins, wrapped in canvas bags around their chests and backs, totaling 82,000 coins. The officer intended to take the two men to the water police station for processing, but one of them, named Li Xiaolizi, secretly offered the officer a silver dollar, attempting to bribe him to let them go. The officer refused and took the bribe money and the two men to the police station. Under interrogation, they confessed that one was Li Xiaolizi, 28 years old, from Jiangbei, and the other was Long Xiaolong, 27 years old, also from Jiangbei. They confessed that they intended to transport the copper coins to Hong Kong by steamer. The police chief, based on the confession, ordered the copper coins to be confiscated and handed over to customs. Long Xiaolong was released as it was his first offense, while Li Xiaolizi was charged with bribery and held for transfer to the local court for prosecution. (2) Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, the Suzhou steamer of the Taikoo Company was loading cargo at the company's wharf on the Puxi side after crossing from the Huatong Wharf in Pudong. As the ship was scheduled to depart that day, customs officers boarded the ship to search for contraband as usual. They discovered five bags of copper coins, about 60,000-70,000, in the hold. The customs officers, as they had not finished their search, and the stevedores were busy loading cargo, making it difficult to search, ordered the stevedores to temporarily stop working. However, the stevedores refused, leading to a conflict. The Western head of the customs search team was punched in the back. The situation escalated, and the ship reported it to the water police station. Police officers boarded the ship to restore order, allowing the customs officers to continue their work.</p>
<p>▲ Smuggling In Song Haiyun, from Shangyu, was found carrying over 60,000 copper coins yesterday afternoon while passing near the Taikoo Company in Pudong. He was stopped by a patrol officer from the Third District, who took him and the copper coins to the district headquarters. Song confessed that he was 45 years old and worked as a tea server on the Taikoo New Ning steamer. He saw that the price of copper coins was rising in Shanghai, so he invested in buying these coins from Datong and planned to resell them for profit. The district chief ordered an investigation and further action.</p>

<p>Hu Yufang was previously hit by a car driven by Tian Yaoming, a driver for the Russian merchant company Laiyi. After receiving medical treatment, Hu felt that his losses were significant and hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Laiyi Company for compensation. The Special District Court held a hearing the other day, and the plaintiff invited a British soldier to testify. However, as the defendant failed to appear in court, the presiding judge adjourned the hearing to a later date. The defendant, Laiyi Company, has also hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to write a defense statement, denying any responsibility for compensation.</p>

<p>▲ Recovered by Police</p>
<p>The other night, around 7:00 PM, two dancers from the Paris dance hall, one named Wang and the other named Feng, along with a "Miss Shi," were going to the Wing On Company to shop from their residence in Yuqing Lane, North Chengdu Road. While walking along Jing'an Temple Road, Wang's purse was suddenly snatched by a thief, Dong Jianglang, who fled. Fortunately, he was apprehended by police. Upon inspection, the purse contained 26 silver dollars, as well as other items, all of which were intact. The next morning, the police handed Dong over to the Special District Court for trial. Judge Wu, after questioning the thief, sentenced him to six months in prison, and the stolen items were returned to the original owner.</p>

<p>Ding Baolong, from Jiangbei, 27 years old, was arrested in the French Concession for a crime and sentenced to imprisonment by the French court. He was sent to prison to serve his sentence. Currently, Ding became ill while in custody and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the prison warden. However, due to the severity of his illness, treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital on the afternoon of the 17th. The hospital notified the prison, which in turn notified the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to send someone to take the body to the morgue. The police station sent detectives to investigate and notify the family to claim the body for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Fire in a Workshop in Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Around 2:00 AM the other night, a fire suddenly broke out in a workshop owned by a Mr. Zhang in Huayuan Shiqiao, Pudong. The dense smoke spread quickly, threatening to engulf the area. The patrol police noticed and immediately sounded the alarm, waking the neighbors from their sleep. Together, they worked to extinguish the fire, which was brought under control and burned down a kitchen building. Afterward, the police took Liu Yunzhang, a worker at the workshop, and Jiang Shouqiao, the owner of a neighboring lumberyard, to the district headquarters. After questioning, it was determined that the fire originated in the workshop, and Liu was fined 10 yuan. Jiang Shouqiao was released as he was not involved.</p>

Around 11:00 AM, they took cars back to the Central Hotel to rest.</p>

Impoverished counties may jointly operate one school. The review opinion: Special cities may set up several rural normal schools according to actual needs. Article 2 was revised to say that normal schools and senior high school normal departments should be established by the province as a principle. All normal schools established by the provinces that have not been merged into senior high schools should continue to maintain their independence and strive to enrich their content. There is no need to urgently increase the number of schools. All provincial normal schools that have been merged into senior high schools may gradually separate them within a possible scope, depending on local conditions.

Liao Shicheng, Chen Bulei, Wu Jiaxiang, Zhao Naichuan, Lu Dianyang, Zhang Mojun, Lu Huangang, and Gu Shusen attended. The third section, subsection C of the second item of the Measures for Establishing Middle Schools, was revised again. The ratio of ordinary high schools to agricultural and industrial high schools should be based on the number of senior high schools in a province, with ordinary and agricultural and industrial departments each accounting for half. If the number of ordinary high schools and agricultural, industrial, and commercial high schools already established exceeds the ratio of three to one, the ordinary high schools that exceed the ratio should be converted into agricultural or industrial departments during the period of political tutelage before the review and approval. Add a new item E below: In provinces with only one high school, one more should be added during the period of political tutelage, so that each province has at least one ordinary high school and one agricultural or industrial high school when the period of political tutelage expires. The provincial education departments should formulate school establishment plans and submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation. The original item E was changed to item F and passed as the original. Section 5: Emphasis on initial learning experiments, passed as the original proposal. Section 6: Raising the level of ordinary high schools, the first item was revised: In addition to the establishment provisions in Section 3 of this plan, Section 2, provinces that establish ordinary high schools with simple equipment and poor performance should run junior high schools in provinces with better performance. Section 7: Revision of the implementation methods for vocational subjects, first, in addition to the planned internship for students in industrial high schools or vocational schools, the Ministry of Education will entrust experts to formulate separate methods for agricultural, commercial, and other internship methods, and the rest will be passed. Section 8: Reorganizing private middle schools, first, urging registration, A, the above article remains the same, and those who exceed the time limit should be ordered to suspend operations or order high schools to convert to junior high schools and junior high schools to convert to elementary schools. The first A was revised to those who have been running junior high schools or high schools for more than seven years, and the rest were passed. Chen Bulei and Wang Maozu were recommended to draft the Secondary School Moral Education Program. The first review meeting of the Elementary Education Group was chaired by Chen Heqin, Xu Xing, and Nie Tiren. As a result of the review: 1. Each province should consider the local situation and economic capacity to establish special schools for children, divided into three types: gifted, mentally retarded, and disabled schools. Each city and county should set up special children's classes. 2. Moral education and health education should be integrated into the curriculum as a whole.</p>

The meeting was chaired by Cai Yuanpei and recorded by Guo Youshou. As a result of the review, the original proposal was generally agreed, but with the detailed provisions being too meticulous, everyone strongly advocated changing the complex to simple. The key points of the revision were: (1) All conditions for establishing universities were cancelled and changed to the decision of the teacher on whether to establish based on local economic and environmental conditions and the need for the university; (2) Item 11 of the original proposal, "Measures for cracking down on private vocational schools and above," was changed to item 12, and item 12 was changed to item 21. The purpose should be to encourage the operation of private vocational schools and above, with special emphasis; (3) Regarding the sixteen articles on measures for universities and vocational schools to promote education, articles 2, 4, 6, 7, 6, 10, 11, 13, and 16 were cancelled, and item 12 was changed to establish various educational practical guidance centers.</p>
<p>▲Joint Meeting of Teacher Training and Compulsory Education Groups</p>
<p>The Teacher Training and Compulsory Education Groups held a joint review meeting from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM. More than twenty committee members from the two groups attended, including Zhang Honglie, Zhu Jingnong, Chen Bulei, Chen Dezheng, Meng Xiancheng, Wang Maozu, Yu Ziyi, Jin Zengcheng, Tao Xuan, and Li Zheng. The meeting was chaired by Zhang Honglie and recorded by Jin Zengcheng.

As a result, the original articles and sentences were changed from complex to simple, and issues such as the cost of normal students were all submitted to today's review meeting for resolution.</p>
<p>▲Secondary Education Review Meeting</p>
<p>The Secondary Education Group held its second review meeting on the 17th in the morning, attended by committee members Wu Jiaxiang, Lu Yang, Wang Maozu, and Chen Bulei. As a result of the review, the following supplementary opinions were reported regarding the provisions in Section 3 of the original plan, "Establishment of Middle Schools": (2) During the six-year period of political tutelage, if provinces have already established ordinary middle schools and senior high schools, no more high schools will be added, and the existing high schools will be reorganized, but this limit does not apply to those with educational funding of more than two million yuan; (2) If a province establishes a high school, ordinary and vocational departments should each account for half as a principle. If there are more ordinary middle schools and high schools already established, the agricultural and industrial departments should be converted separately during the period of political tutelage, depending on the circumstances; (3) According to the current survey, there are ten provinces that have not established high schools. During the period of political tutelage, the provinces should establish one ordinary high school and one vocational high school each.</p>
<p>▲Mongolian and Tibetan Education Review Meeting</p>
<p>The Mongolian and Tibetan Education Group held its first review meeting at 9:00 AM on the 17th, chaired by Ma Hetian. Wang Ruyi advocated changing the name of this group to the Mongolian, Tibetan, and Hui Education Group. After discussion by the committee members, it was considered that it could not be established because the Hui people in Xinjiang could not apply the inland education. The Mongolian and Tibetan educational administration was also discussed without concrete results.</p>

The Elementary Education Group's review was the fastest, and the plan was generally passed as is. The Overseas Chinese Education Group and the Social Education Group made many revisions. The Compulsory Education Group had more objections to the Teacher Training Group's affairs, which was also of great importance. The Adult Literacy Education Group made many revisions to the title, and the discussion was not very precise. Other groups were able to proceed according to the original plan.

<h3 id="e150">Yesterday Afternoon's Grand Banquet at the Legislative Yuan <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>▲Solving Problems of Surname, Marriage, and Family</p>
<p>At noon on the 18th, Legislative Yuan Presidents Hu and Lin invited all members to the Yuan for a meal. More than a hundred members attended, including Cai Yuanpei, Li Shizeng, Wu Zhihui, Jiang Menglin, and Yang Xingfo. Hu Zhantang, Lin Zichao, Shao Yuanchong, and others accompanied them. During the meal, Hu Zhantang gave a speech, briefly stating that the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan welcome all members because the relationship between legislation and education is extremely close. The Legislative Yuan can only formulate the principles and guidelines from the Party's standpoint, and the detailed education plan must rely on the formulation of various experts. Therefore, the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan have great hope for all members and are very grateful for the hard work of all of you. I am a layman in education. I only studied at a crash course for normal schools in Japan for three months, which was thirty-three years ago. I returned to China to engage in education work and at the same time do revolutionary work, doing it twice, each time for only three and a half months, all of which failed due to revolutionary reasons. Since then, I can only sigh at the education work. The success of education and revolution is extremely important. Educators should have the spirit of revolution, and revolutionaries should also understand the principles of education. There is no difference between the two. Today, I have said a lot of nonsense, which cannot be used for your reference. I am afraid that you will not be able to digest some bad things you have eaten. Now, a comrade of the Legislative Yuan, standing on the legislative stage, has raised three questions, please ask the educators for advice, perhaps to help you digest, and I toast everyone a glass of water and wine, and wish you all good health. The three questions are raised for research:</p>
<p>The first question is the surname question (1) Do you want a surname? (2) Do you not want a surname? (3) If you want a surname, should it be the father's surname or the mother's surname?</p>
<p>The second question is the marriage question (1) Do you want to get married? (2) Do you not want to get married? (3) If you want to get married, is there a limit to early marriage or late marriage?</p>
<p>The third question is the family question (1) Do you want a family? (2) Do you not want a family? (3) If you want a family, is it better to have a big family or a small family?</p>
<p>Next, Chen Mengzhao, director of the Jiangsu Education Department, was publicly recommended by the members to give a reply, briefly saying that he was deeply grateful for the grand banquet hosted by the Legislative Yuan today. Mr. Hu is a master of education and a revolutionary master of education. From thirty-three years ago until now, he has never forgotten education and has always been working hard in education. He is our true revolutionary education mentor. I only represent my colleagues in requesting (1) Mr. Hu to come to the venue to give us a speech; (2) Leading revolutionary legal experts from the Legislative Yuan to guide our work. Today is the anniversary of the founding of the National Government. Please borrow a glass of wine from Mr. Hu and wish Mr. Hu good health, and shout long live the National Government. Afterwards, the discussion began. In order to save space, the answers of each member are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>The first question is the surname question (1) Zhong Rongguang: It is good to have a surname, and it is good not to have a surname. It is good to follow the father's surname, and it is good to follow the mother's surname. Hu Dinghua: Girls take the surname. If there are</p>
<p>girls in the university, they should take the surname. If there are no girls, they should not take the surname. (The reporter noted that Mr. Hu's school seems to have no girls, so it is not necessary to take the surname) Zhang Mojun: To maintain social order, there should be a surname. Children can freely choose their surname, but it should be limited to the parents' surname and cannot be a surname other than the parents'. Wu Zhihui: It is good to have it, and it is good not to have it. When someone invites me to eat, I must have a surname. When no one invites me to eat, I don't need a surname. Cai Jiemin: It is better not to have it. It is unfair to use the father's surname, and it is inappropriate to use the mother's surname. It is better not to have it. You can't use other symbols to replace it. Li Shizeng: The surname question is close to a natural science question. From the perspective of human genealogy in biology, in order to study human heredity and evolution, it seems necessary to preserve the surname. However, how to preserve the surname is another question. The naming method can be improved at any time. Jiang Menglin: This is a matter of time. Within fifty years, surnames are necessary.</p>
<p>The second question is the marriage question (1) Zhong Rongguang: Do not get married, especially people in the education field should not get married at all. If you are already married, do not have children (2) Hu Dinghua: Opposes not getting married, saying that if you do not get married, there will be no</p>
<p>young people in future generations, then the rice bowl problem of educators will be shaken (3) Zhang Mojun: Let people be free and see how each person's environment determines (4) Wu Zhihui: It is good to get married, because if someone gets married, someone will invite me, an old man, to be a witness, and I will get a great deal (5) Cai Jiemin: In the ideal new village, it is better not to get married. In this new village, there is a good organization, with single rooms for one person to stay and rooms for two people to sleep together. There are dance halls, entertainment rooms, and all kinds of equipment. When two people want to live in the same room, they must first be examined by a doctor and have a very accurate registration, such as when and what time someone lives in the same room. In the future, if children are born, there can be a mark. Li Shizeng merged the answer with the family question, because these two questions are close to social science questions and are very complicated and have great flexibility. From the perspective of the present teaching, he sympathizes with Mr. Cai very much. The marriage system and the family system both evolve with society. The future solution will definitely tend to shrink. Marriage shrinks to not getting married, and family shrinks to individual life. At the same time, there may need to be organizations with cooperative characteristics, just like what Mr. Cai said. In short, this is an evolving thing, and there can be no definite answer. In fact, it is gradually evolving towards a solution. For example, Mr. Tan Zhongda's marriage has abolished all wedding ceremonies, which is an example. Evolution is a common place for philosophy and science in the universe. Everything is evolving. All questions are summarized into scientific axioms. Morality is scientific and also an evolving thing. Solving these few questions cannot be an exception. Eight Jiang Menglin: Marriage is necessary within fifty years. Fifty years later, some people said that at that time, sexual diseases would be stopped, and not getting married would not be a problem. The third family question, one Zhong Rongguang is better not to have, two Wu Zhihui is better not to have, if you don't want it, you can specialize in eating other people's people, and you won't come to eat your own, three Cai Jiemin is better not to have it, if you have to, a small family is better than a big family, four Li Shizeng, (see the second question) five Jiang Menglin, it is necessary within fifty years, and whether you want a big family or a small family should depend on the economic and social development situation. In agricultural society, big families are needed, and in industrial society, big families are needed. After fifty years, it will be another question. After five hundred years, it will be even more incredible. At the end of the meeting, Mr. Hu Zhantang said that today I have listened to the high theory of all the gentlemen. Mr. Wu talked about facts, Mr. Jiang talked about theory, Mr. Li talked about science, and Mr. Jiang talked about time. They all have good answers to the questions we raised, which can be used for reference by the Legislative Yuan. I would like to thank you with a glass of wine. After the meeting, a photo was taken in the garden of the Legislative Yuan to commemorate the occasion.</p>

<p>▲Chung Yek-kwong's Response</p>
<p>At 5 PM, Chairman Chiang of the National Government, accompanied by his wife, Madam Soong Mei-ling, invited all members of the Lixingshe for a tea party. After being seated, Chairman Chiang called out each member's name and introduced them, then delivered an impromptu speech, saying that yesterday's speech still had shortcomings, and he hoped that everyone would contribute more ideas today. He emphasized that the most important aspect of education at present is popularization, something that everyone must have noticed. However, simply noticing is not enough; it requires everyone to work together to achieve it. More than fifty of you have come from various provinces, and upon returning, if you enthusiastically promote this in your respective provinces, rapid progress is certain. Mr. Wu Zhihui advocates for phonetic symbols. While phonetic symbols certainly have their imperfections, I, who studied them briefly one or two days in the past, have already forgotten them. However, for teaching illiterate people in rural areas, they are indeed easy to learn. Currently, there is no better method than phonetic symbols to enable the general public to become literate. When we earnestly promote this, within a few years, the number of literate people will certainly increase significantly. I remember when I was eleven or twelve years old, the elementary school taught me Romanization, and I went home and taught my mother and sisters-in-law, who all liked it very much. Learning phonetic symbols will certainly have the same effect. This is the most important point in promoting the popularization of education. I hope that when everyone promotes current Chinese education, what is most needed is not the expansion of higher education, but rather providing graduates of all levels of schools with a way out. Regardless of whether they are from universities, middle schools, or elementary schools, the majority of graduates are unemployed. This means that society adds a significant number of unemployed people each year. Without education, without a job, and unable to farm or work in industry, they can only turn to a path of decline, which is very dangerous. Taking military academies as an example, there are more than ten thousand graduates, but the military cannot accommodate them all. The academies have established advanced classes to provide placement, giving them opportunities for further study on one hand, and providing them with a way out on the other. Ordinary schools, of course, cannot operate in this way. Yesterday, I talked about promoting the popularization of agricultural education, which is a good way to remedy student unemployment. Students in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools should receive more agricultural training while they are in school, so that they can engage in agricultural work after graduation, without the risk of unemployment. And the national economy can also gradually become more prosperous. Secondly, regarding the rectification of the academic atmosphere, I said yesterday that if everyone earnestly takes responsibility to do it, it can certainly be done. Since I started running the military academy, I have trained tens of thousands of students over the past five years, and there has never been a case of strikes or disturbances. The students come from all over the country and are very diverse, with some being members of the Communist Party, some being nationalists, and some being anarchists. However, after only three months of training at the academy, they can be guided onto the right path, because young people have not been influenced by a bad environment, and their conscience is easily awakened. As long as the educators are sincere, it is impossible not to move young people. At present, academic thoughts and actions are very inconsistent. Those engaged in education, especially schools, and principals should take responsibility. Once the education policy is improved and decided, regardless of how society may oppose it, it must be carried out straightforwardly. We must absolutely not compromise with young students. Those in charge should not harbor selfish intentions, and should follow the rules and be punctual for classes. Students will not oppose them. If there is opposition, strict measures should be taken without any compromise. The gaze of the teachers can inspire respect in the students. Often, those who run schools dare not look students in the eye, and as a result, the students become more arrogant and the academic atmosphere deteriorates to an irreparable state. From today onwards, the education sector should take responsibility and work hard to implement the decided policy, regardless of any obstacles. In this way, education will certainly develop, and the path will certainly shine brightly. Please forgive me if what I have said is incorrect, he concluded. Next, Chung Yek-kwong, an expert in overseas Chinese education, delivered a response on behalf of the members, saying that over the past two days, Chairman Chiang had repeatedly emphasized important issues such as rectifying the academic atmosphere, promoting agricultural education, strictly implementing party education, and promoting phonetic symbols. Everyone is willing to sincerely absorb them, and the Chairman's instructions are more meaningful than the proposals discussed in the program. He expressed gratitude on behalf of everyone. Next, Chung continued to report on the current situation of overseas Chinese education, asking the government and education authorities to pay attention. The general idea was that if overseas Chinese education is not promoted further, the overseas Chinese will be assimilated by foreigners within twenty or thirty years in terms of knowledge. Those with insufficient knowledge will inevitably be oppressed by foreigners. Whether they die abroad or return to China, in short, in fifty years, there will be no overseas Chinese at all. Chairman Chiang listened to this with great attention. The meeting adjourned at about 7 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Various Aspects of the Conference <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>▲Visiting the Jiangsu Provincial Library Starting Today</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial National Library, located in Longpanli, the capital city, has specially invited members to visit the library for the next three days, starting today, in order to facilitate their visit to the library. The library has a significant collection of Chinese studies books and enjoys considerable prestige in the country.</p>
<p>▲Xikang Representative Returns Home for Funeral</p>
<p>Liu Yunchou, the representative from Xikang, suddenly received a telegram from Chongqing yesterday stating that his wife had passed away in their hometown. Representative Liu sent a letter to Speaker Chiang requesting to resign from his post and left overnight to return home for the funeral.</p>
<p>▲Tomorrow's Banquet</p>
<p>The Beijing Municipal Education Bureau and various municipal schools have decided to hold a joint reception at Wuni Park on the 20th to welcome all teachers.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Reading the Teacher Training Program (1) (Different) <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The combined normal school system in the country was first established in Zhejiang, followed by Jiangsu. During the first National Education Conference, serious discussions arose on this issue. The education departments of Guangdong and Guangxi, National Sun Yat-sen University, the joint association of the normal science department of the Beijing Municipal Education Bureau and Central University, and experts Zhuang Zexuan and Cheng Bolu, among others, advocated that normal schools should be run independently. After several precise discussions, a remedial measure was finally achieved: "In order to promote compulsory education, independent normal schools should be established in each province in addition to the high school normal science department." The trend of opinion from all sides clearly favors the independence of normal schools. In fact, the combination and separation of middle school and normal school involve many time-sensitive and trivial issues. Education authorities who are concerned about this point raise objections. I believe that the education program is a fundamental plan for the next hundred years and cannot be sacrificed for the sake of temporary value. To refrain from eating for fear of choking is unacceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Thoughts After Reading the Education Program Zhuang Zexuan <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Although I had seen fragments of the program that is currently under discussion at the National Education Conference in various places, I did not read the entire thing until I arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday. The detailed plan is extensive, and of course, it is impossible to talk about it carelessly after reading it hastily in a short amount of time. However, as the Shen Bao has been urging me to write an article for several days, I will just talk about what I feel at the moment.</p>
<p>Regarding the various aspects of compulsory primary education for the masses, I have already responded to the solicitation of the Capital Central Daily and wrote an article entitled "On China's Compulsory Education Should Start at the Age of Ten" (see the first issue of the special publication of the National Education Conference in the newspaper on the 12th), in which I expressed some opinions. I will not talk about it for now.</p>
<p>Regarding the secondary education section, it was originally the most difficult to compile. Secondary education is the most difficult to run in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, because the content is the most complex. However, I often hear people say that the wealth and power of a country depend entirely on the quality of secondary-level talent. Therefore, I think that in the future, our country's education sector must pay special attention to this aspect. The current secondary education plan seems to still focus on academics and neglect vocational aspects. Originally, vocational education is very difficult to run in present-day China, but I believe that in the future, China's construction must make good use of vocational education as a tool for promotion. Both Ministers Chiang and Kong vaguely mentioned this idea when the conference opened, but they did not propose concrete measures. The program seems to pay little attention to this point as well. This may be because the conference must focus on a few major issues. I hope that if this conference does not have time to discuss this, the Ministry of Education can unite with the Construction Committee, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the Ministry of Railways, and the Ministry of Transportation, and add a number of industrial and educational experts to hold a joint meeting to discuss this issue specifically. In this way, not only will students have a way out and funding will have a source, but also the mind and material can be built up at the same time.</p>
<p>I believe that the reorganization of higher education is very important. I originally intended to join the higher education group and contribute some opinions, but after attending the meeting and seeing that a large number of people had already joined, I did not do so. I believe that high schools that focus on academics should be supervised by higher education institutions in various places, and people should be sent to participate in the high school graduation exams to improve and standardize the level of enrollment. It is best if each university, especially the national ones, can follow the American approach and set up a joint admissions committee. Those who pass the exam administered by this examination committee can enter any university and can transfer freely. Then each university can specialize in its strengths. Except for a few basic departments, they do not need to be established universally, but can focus on the development of a few departments. I believe that this is extremely important in today's China, where talents and funds are both difficult to obtain. Otherwise, although there are many universities, none of them has a strength. It is always these few people being pulled back and forth, which is the most painful thing for those who run universities. Of course, some departments need more, and three or four can be set up nationwide. Some can be set up with one or two nationwide. The funds saved can be used to increase equipment and increase salaries. In this way, academics can be improved and become independent. I hope that after this conference is over, the Ministry of Education can convene a university administrative conference to resolve this and other related issues.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the issue of etiquette education, this program also seems to neglect this point somewhat. This may also be because the focus is on discussing a few issues. The results of this National Games were certainly very good. It is not easy to occupy a seat at the Far Eastern Games, let alone the fact that athlete sports are just a kind of stimulation, not a fundamental way to promote physical education. I believe that at least a middle school graduate should reach a certain physical education standard, and a university graduate should reach a higher standard (this is what we have already decided to implement at Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou). Special attention should be paid to the training of physical education teachers. These points all seem to be mentioned in the program.</p>
<p>The summary of my feelings is what our representative, Mr. Jin Xiangfan, said in his reply yesterday: This conference is to realize the Three Principles of the People's education determined by the last conference. Education on nationalism, people's livelihood, and people's rights should advance as a whole system. (April 16, in the capital)</p>

<p>At 9:30 AM, the master of ceremonies called for music, and the entire venue was filled with music. After a while, the music stopped, and the master of ceremonies called for everyone to stand at attention. After singing the party song, the flag was raised, and music was played by military bands from the National Government and the municipal government. Then, music was played again. Then, the party and national flags were saluted. Chairman Dai Jitao respectfully read the Premier's will. After reading, there was three minutes of silence. After the silence, the general review began. First, the band played music, and the reporter reported and invited members of the Central Committee to review. Then, he ordered attention, and the military band played music. After the review, they returned to the review stand, and everyone performed basic exercises. Then, the procession began. After the procession was completed, all scouts stood at attention in their predetermined positions to receive admonition. After the admonition, the Scout Song was sung. Then, speeches were given. After the speeches, cheers and slogans were shouted before the troops were dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Flag Raising Ceremony <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>A flagpole about several feet high was erected in the southeast corner of the venue. After singing the party language at the beginning of the meeting, the flag raising ceremony was held. Staff from the secretariat raised the new flag. The national flag was raised from bottom to top. At this time, the messenger ordered a salute. All scouts holding sticks performed the stick salute, while those empty-handed performed the two-finger salute. The troop flags were tilted 30 degrees to the national flag. Other military police, participants, guests, and spectators also paid tribute to the national flag. The military band played ceremonial music. After the national flag was raised to the top of the flagpole, the messenger ordered the salute to be dismissed.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Parade Details <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>(1) Number of Reported Personnel</p>
<p>The location of each troop in the parade was determined by the office in advance, and signs were erected. The entire troop was arranged in a mouth shape, with each troop divided into rows of small teams. After 7:00 AM, the chief commander ordered the messenger to issue the first preparation signal. Five minutes later, the messenger issued the assembly order. After hearing the assembly order, each troop leader gathered the squad leaders in their respective troops with military signals and ordered them to report the number of personnel being inspected. One minute later, the deputy commander summoned the troop leaders with military signals and ordered them to report the number of personnel being inspected in each troop. One minute later, the chief commander summoned the deputy commanders with military signals and ordered them to report the number of troops under their command and the number of scouts. Then, the chief commander reported to the stage that there were 121 troops in total and 3,366 scouts.</p>
<p>(2) Inspection</p>
<p>After reporting the number of personnel, central representatives and judges set off along the designated inspection route, led by the flag-carrying team. The flag-carrying team was composed of three male and female service personnel, three male and female scouts, three sea scouts, and three cub scouts selected by the chief commander in advance. The leader of the team was the deputy commander, and the flag was in the middle of the first row, carried by service personnel. When starting, the messenger ordered attention. When the inspectors passed each troop, the band played music, and the troop leader ordered a salute. The inspectors returned the salute. The inspectors circled the entire venue along the inspection route and returned to the review stand.</p>
<p>(3) Basic Exercises</p>
<p>After Chairman Chiang and others returned to the review stand, the messenger ordered all scouts to rest. After five minutes, the basic exercises began. At this time, the messenger ordered: 1. Attention, 2. Right dress, 3. Eyes front, 4. Count off, 5. Right face, 6. Left face, 7. At ease. All scouts moved quickly and were full of energy.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Procession Details <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>(1) Messenger Starts</p>
<p>After the exercises were completed, the chief commander reported to the stage that the procession inspection would begin and invited the central representatives to inspect in front of the stage. At the same time, the messenger ordered: 1. Attention, 2. Right face, 3. Forward march. At this time, all scouts began to march.</p>
<p>(2) Circling the Venue Once</p>
<p>When all the scouts began to march, they were led by the deputy commander and the band, and walked past the stage once. When reaching the inspection area, the troop leader ordered "Eyes right." All members looked to the right and passed with goose steps. The troop leaders also performed the salute, and the inspectors returned the salute as required. After all troops passed the inspection area, the troop leaders ordered "Eyes forward," and all members changed to a regular pace and proceeded forward, passing to the left of the command platform and forming a single line according to the predetermined position, standing ready for instruction.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Chairman Chiang's Points of Attention During the Procession and Review <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲ Pace, Uniforms, and Next Year's Review, etc.</p>
<p>▲ During the Procession: During the procession, Chairman Chiang and Dai Chuanxian both stood at the entrance of the reviewing stand to conduct the review. Chiang paid close attention to the pace of each scout troop, especially Troops 88, 89, and 111. When these two troops passed the reviewing stand, Chiang inquired about their origins one by one. Staff officers replied with the troop names. Zhang Daofan reported to Chiang that one of the troops was the Nanjing Founding Memorial Boy Scouts, founded by Madam Huang Keqiang and named the "Poor Children's Education and Welfare Home." Subsequently, Chiang and Dai discussed the need to raise more funds for next year's Boy Scout general review to make it better than this year's, advocating for advance preparations. Dai also expressed his opinions. Then, Chiang noticed that the flag of Troop 177 was too low and instructed the staff to raise it higher. He also inquired about the Liangjiang female students in detail.</p>
<p>▲ During the Review: During the review, Chiang, Hu, Dai, Tan, Zhu Peide, Zhang Zhizhong, Wu Siyu, and others went around the field for a full inspection. The scouts saluted when they reached each troop, and Chiang and others returned the salutes accordingly. Chiang paid close attention to the uniforms and postures of each scout and, noting the muddy condition of the field, immediately asked the staff, "Why was it not changed to the airfield for the event?" The staff replied that it was too rushed. Chiang repeatedly said, "Very well, very well." On that day, Chiang wore a military uniform with a large red badge in the center of his left pocket, appearing very energetic. Hu wore a traditional long robe and mandarin jacket, Dai wore a Zhongshan suit, and others wore military uniforms, casual clothes, or Western suits, creating a diverse array of styles.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Chairman Chiang's Address <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Three Principles of the People Are the Fundamental Creed of the Boy Scouts</p>
<p>The Goal of Training Is to Create Independent Personalities</p>
<p>Should Abandon Romantic, Frivolous, Decadent, and Treacherous Vices</p>
<p>Do Not Be Blinded by Base, Sordid, and Expedient Mentalities</p>
<p>Performance Results Enrich Spiritual Cultivation</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang delivered an address to the Chinese Boy Scouts yesterday at the venue. His words were as follows: The Chinese Boy Scouts have a history of over ten years since their founding. In the past, they have demonstrated quite good achievements. Since coming under the guidance of our Party, they have a central belief, a unified organization, and practical training, making them even more advanced than before. Judging by the number of participants, there are several thousand participating in this review. Compared with countries like England and the United States, we are indeed far behind, but this also proves that the Chinese Boy Scouts are indeed in the process of development. This first general review of the national Boy Scouts is truly the beginning of a new era for the Chinese Boy Scouts and can be considered an unprecedented grand event in China. I am very happy to participate in this general review and, at the same time, hold infinite hope.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Boy Scouts take wisdom, benevolence, and courage as their fundamental spirit. However, this fundamental spirit must have a supreme principle to rely on, and there must be a great mission to which it can be attributed. The Chinese Boy Scouts are named Party Boy Scouts, which indicates that their supreme principle is the Three Principles of the People, and their greatest mission is to realize the Three Principles of the People. The Three Principles of the People are the doctrine of saving the country, the people, and the world. Realizing the Three Principles of the People is realizing the greatest mission of saving the country, the people, and the world. Therefore, the Chinese Boy Scouts must cultivate and develop the spirit of wisdom, benevolence, and courage under the belief of the Three Principles of the People. This is a fundamental creed of our Chinese Boy Scouts. Only those who can abide by this creed are worthy of being Chinese Boy Scouts and worthy of being called Party Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>The humans of the twentieth century should all be members of society and independent individuals. If a person is isolated and acts alone, separating from society, they cannot maintain their survival. If a person relies on others and parasitizes society, they cannot maintain their survival for long. Being able to manage one's own life with one's own strength is being an independent individual. Being able to serve society with one's own strength is being a member of society. Therefore, the goal of Boy Scout training is to create the qualifications of independent individuals and members of society. Training in areas such as first aid, communication, tracking, and etiquette is training in serving society. Skills such as washing, sewing, and cooking are techniques for managing one's own life with one's own strength. If these training sessions are skilled and last for a long time, they will naturally become a kind of social person with an independent spirit. Among them, the most important thing is the spirit of united living. If every member of a Boy Scout leaves his group, he loses his function, and at the same time, his group also loses a share of strength. Therefore, the group life of the Boy Scouts is organic and extremely close. If human society can reach this level, it will definitely be very developed and advanced. The training of the Boy Scouts is to expand this spirit of strictly divided group life to social life, so that society becomes an organic and close society. The Premier of our Party once said that people are endowed with a natural nature of being in groups, but it must be trained before the nature of being in groups can progress. This is one of the most important goals of Boy Scout training.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Chinese revolution is to build a society based on the Three Principles of the People. A society based on the Three Principles of the People is an organized, disciplined, and strict society, not a free and loose society. However, the Chinese people's looseness and dilapidation have reached their extreme. If it is not subjected to strict training, this organized and disciplined society based on the Three Principles of the People can never be realized. The people of the past era are already difficult to correct. Youth are the masters of the country in the future and the backbone of society. Therefore, the only hope for China lies in youth. However, because of the poor social environment, most of the youth in China are now romantic, frivolous, decadent, and treacherous, only knowing personal freedom and not abiding by group discipline, indulging in pleasure and disregarding everything. If this phenomenon is allowed to continue, China's future will only lead to national subjugation and racial extinction. Therefore, in this transitional era of revolution, the Boy Scouts are an urgently needed organization. Those who join the Boy Scouts now are all young people over the age of twelve, not far from adulthood. If they can receive sufficient and strict training during this period, they will definitely become the backbone of the new society after they reach adulthood. Therefore, the responsibility of building a society based on the Three Principles of the People rests on the shoulders of every member of our Boy Scouts. Therefore, every member of the Boy Scouts should strive to eliminate all bad habits such as romanticism, frivolity, decadence, and treachery, cultivate the spirit of respecting the group and obeying discipline, abide by the Premier's last words, "Only the group has freedom, individuals have no freedom," and create a model of Chinese youth.</p>
<p>In the revolutionary process, the mission of the Party Boy Scouts is particularly important compared to the Boy Scouts of other countries. Its nature can be said to be a reserve army for the revolutionary ranks. Its mission is to complete the great cause of the National Revolution. Every member is a young revolutionary fighter. His thoughts must be pure and not shaken by heresies other than the Three Principles of the People. His motives must be pure, and he must not be blinded by any base, sordid, or expedient mentalities. He must have a spirit of self-improvement and self-reliance, and the perseverance to endure hardship and hard work. He should not pursue superficial vanity but should seek inner enrichment. Only in this way can he be worthy of being called a revolutionary youth, and only in this way can he shoulder difficult and enormous responsibilities. It is necessary for every member to be trained to this level, and then the mission of the Boy Scouts can be considered to have been completed.</p>
<p>Now, because of financial and other difficulties, the Chinese Boy Scouts are limited to a part of the students in schools. However, in the future, we must find ways to expand and develop them. Not only students in schools but also the youth of the general public in society should have the opportunity to join them. Then the training can be universal, and the effect can be great. This is my hope for those in charge of running the Boy Scouts.</p>
<p>I am more pleased to participate in this general review today than to review the army because I see these thousands of innocent and lively young people as if there are thousands of strands of hope placed before me, so I am very moved and very gratified. I hope that if any shortcomings are found as a result of this review, we should try our best to improve them. If, by the time of the second review, the members' belief in the doctrine can be deepened, the achievements of service performance can be further improved, and the cultivation of the spirit can be further enriched, then the future of China will have infinite hope. Finally, I wish the Chinese Boy Scouts a long life.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Wu Zhihui's Address <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>▲ Boy Scouts should struggle equally</p>
<p>▲ Protect yourselves, protect your nation</p>
<p>Brothers, today I see the National Boy Scouts gathering together. I recall that when I first went to England, I did not know English. At that time, I met Premier Sun Yat-sen and saw a Boy Scout. The Premier said, "This is a Boy Scout." Later, when I went to Scotland, I said, "These are the people of Scotland." The Zhongshan suit invented by the Premier is the uniform of the Boy Scouts. The purpose is to transform the elderly into Boy Scouts, wearing arms, which is a convenience for a collective group, for peace, struggle, and saving China. This is the revolutionary purpose of the Premier. The Chinese Boy Scouts should use peace and struggle to implement Chinese nationalism. The Boy Scouts should manage everything themselves. Anything in the world can be Boy Scoutized to protect themselves and their nation, and promote world harmony. This is your responsibility. You should gather the Chinese people together, use persuasion and struggle methods, and achieve the goal of saving China peacefully as the Premier said, and eliminate all reactionary warlords in the country. This is my little wish for the Chinese Boy Scouts, a hundred million years.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Cai Yuanpei's Address <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>▲ Emphasize struggle, sacrifice, independence, and mutual assistance</p>
<p>In short, today, taking the opportunity of the National Boy Scout General Review, I would like to offer a few suggestions to all comrades. According to the regulations of the Boy Scouts, the main points are nothing more than "struggle, sacrifice, independence, and mutual assistance." Boy Scouts must have the strength to struggle in order to be independent, and they must have the spirit of sacrifice in order to help each other. The Three Principles of the People written by the Premier are also aimed at making each of us have the strength to struggle and the spirit of sacrifice to practice the virtues of independence and mutual assistance. What each comrade must understand today is that the total number of National Boy Scouts is over 13,000, but only over 3,000 can come today. What is the reason? We must know that those who cannot come to Beijing are actually subject to various obstacles and preventions. We should practice mutual assistance, use the strength of struggle and the spirit of sacrifice to break these obstacles, so that when the second general review is held, all the National Boy Scouts can come to Beijing to participate. We must also help the majority of other young people to receive this kind of training so that all the people in the country have the spirit of "struggle, sacrifice, independence, and mutual assistance."</p>
<h3 id="e168">Dai Chuanxian's Address <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲ Training Boy Scouts is a good medicine for saving the Chinese nation</p>
<p>Comrades, the first National Boy Scout General Review and Jamboree convened by the Central Government is the first day today. Just now, during the review, seeing such a large-scale assembly of the first general review and such a unified spirit, I feel very satisfied. However, I still hope that all of you, no matter which group you are in, must remember for yourselves that you must know where you should seek improvement and where you should seek progress in the future. You must continue to work hard to train until the second review next year, and you will have better results. At the same time, in terms of substance and quantity, there will be greater expansion. Today, taking this opportunity, I would like to state my personal opinions to you. We deeply know that the Chinese nation is extremely weak. For more than a thousand years, it has been oppressed by those barbaric and tyrannical nations. In the eras of the Six Dynasties, the Five Dynasties, and the Mongol and Manchu Dynasties, the oppression was even more severe. Why is such a large nation-state so unlucky? In the recent hundred years or so, it has suffered even more severely from the oppression of imperialists. Under this kind of situation, how should we work hard to become strong? To put it simply to you, when China was strong and prosperous, it was called a first-class country and nation. Wherever people and vehicles could reach in the whole world, no matter who they were, they all respected the Chinese people. It can be said that they paid tribute every year and came to court every year. The reason for this is that China is a country of etiquette and a civilized country. The so-called etiquette is like all the etiquette and organizations and human feelings established by the country, which can be said to be etiquette. The so-called righteousness is that everything, no matter how big or small, is handled well, which is called righteousness. Being able to sacrifice to help others can also be called the virtue of righteousness. The reason why our country is called a country of etiquette and righteousness is that our people can stand out from all nations without using military oppression, but taking the protection of civilization. But today, what is our status? The total number of National Boy Scouts is only over 13,000. Taking China's population of 400 million as a proportion, that is, only one in 40,000 can receive this kind of education, that is, only one in tens of thousands of people is a Boy Scout. Comrades, think about how many Chinese people can read and write? How many more people can go to higher or vocational schools? This kind of proportion is really chilling. At the same time, I ask all comrades to pay attention to the actions of a group of people after they return to their hometowns. Most of them are disrespectful when they meet, and they even curse other people's parents and ancestors. The people of the so-called country of etiquette and righteousness should help up those who stumble and rescue those who fall into the water. But now, most people not only do not help up those who stumble or rescue those who fall into the water, but they also clap and laugh on the sidelines. This kind of habit is exposing that China's original etiquette and righteousness have been lost. Now, we hope that all Boy Scouts will pay attention to this kind of bad habit and correct it after they return to their hometowns. We must make people everywhere have a spirit of mutual assistance, and all actions must be polite, creating a civilized country with etiquette and righteousness. This kind of education and training for Boy Scouts is really a good medicine for the Chinese nation to be reborn. Comrades, seeing such an important duty, you should strive forward to save China. After the address, the slogan was cheered several times, and the meeting was dismissed at 12:30.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Cheers at the Venue <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>

<p>Because the Boy Scouts were tired from the general review in the morning, they rested for half a day in the afternoon. The group leaders organized the internal affairs of their groups. A bonfire was held in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Bonfire Party Last Night <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>On the evening of the 18th, the second morning of the National Boy Scout Jamboree, after the general review, the guests had already gathered. After the meeting reported that they would rest in the afternoon and organize the campsite, the guests gradually withdrew. At 6:00 PM, the campsite was extremely crowded with guests. The bonfire party is a unique performance method for Boy Scouts during camping. Although Boy Scouts from various places have held it during camping, this is the first time that a Chinese Boy Scout bonfire party has been held. The grand occasion at that time is recorded in detail as follows: The meeting started at 8:00 PM. The guests and all the Boy Scouts formed a large circle. For a while, the flames were blazing, and the smoke was rising into the sky. The group performances began. The first was the English singing of Troop 196. The song was "Over There," with melodious twists and turns, which can be called wonderful. The second was the mouth and nose music of Troop 92 from Xiamen Jimei, with amazing rhythm. The third was the comical dance of Troop 61, with strange costumes, which was praised by the entire venue. The fourth was the singing of Troop 119 from Nanyang Middle School. First, each person held a fire and ran into the venue, circling it once. Then, they cheered "Long live China" and played three "Homesick" songs on the harmonica. The entire venue applauded thunderously. The fifth was the five-minute "Touch Touch" of Troop 78. One person placed several paper notes in a bag. Each person had to touch one and perform according to the name of the game written on the paper note, such as telling a story, performing a set of boxing, or singing a section of "The Empty City Stratagem." The sixth was the dance of Troop 121 from Shanghai Southeast Women's Physical Education College. The dance was called the "Bullfight Dance," which made everyone laugh. The seventh was the joke of Troop 117. The eighth was the boxing of Troop 197, namely Gao Junqiu from Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College performing a set of "Five-Road Chaquan." The ninth was the boxing of Troop 113, with Wu Xueying performing a set of sword dance. There were many other performances.</p>

<p>▲ Athletes will travel to Suzhou this morning: About one hundred male and female athletes, led by Hao Boyang, the main person in charge of the Sports Promotion Association, and coaches, will travel to Suzhou by car at 7:00 this morning. They will return to Shanghai at 5:00 or 6:00 that evening. ▲ Continued donations to the Games fund: The funds required to attend the Far Eastern Games this time are very large. In addition to the 20,000 yuan funded by the National Government, the rest is raised from all parties. The results are still good. Yesterday, it was learned that Lin Zhuguang, a warm-hearted overseas Chinese in the Philippines who is enthusiastic about sports, personally donated 1,000 yuan and promised to raise funds there on his behalf. Tan Yasheng also donated 500 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Additional recruitment of volunteer coaches: The former competition board decided that if there are Westerners in Shanghai with rich sports experience, they can be asked to help.

<p>▲ Javanese female tennis players will return to China</p>
<p>The Li sisters, four overseas Chinese female tennis players from Java, have superb skills. Ms. Li Lian won the national women's tennis singles title in this National Games.

<h3 id="e183">Anecdotes of American Minister Johnson <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Shui</p>
<p>According to foreign news reports, the anecdotes of American Minister Johnson are quite detailed. The original author has lived in Beiping for a long time and is a close friend of Johnson's, so what he says should not be false. Here is my translation of it:</p>
<p>▲Rickshaw Obsession: Johnson likes to ride rickshaws in China, especially in Beiping, and doesn't like to ride motorcars. Except for occasional urgent official business, he will drive a car. When he goes to banquets or leisure activities, a rickshaw is indispensable. Johnson once said to someone: "Watching the scenery from a car is like glancing at flowers from horseback, with no enjoyment at all. It's better to hire a rickshaw and walk slowly, which is more suitable." Also, Johnson is very polite to the rickshaw pullers he hires. He always pays more than others. Along the way, he likes to chat with the rickshaw pullers, not considering himself an official. Rickshaw pullers in the Dongjiaominxiang area of ​​Beiping all know Johnson, but very few of them know that he is the American minister to China.</p>
<p>▲Fondness for Black Bow Ties: At various banquets in Beiping, if the head of the embassy is present, guests must wear evening dress. However, Johnson is not used to this. He often wears a regular suit with a black bow tie. He also often talks about this with people in the embassy, ​​strenuously advocating the black bow tie doctrine. If there is a banquet one evening that requires him to wear full dress, Johnson often asks a friend halfway through to remove the full dress and replace it with the same clothing so that when all the guests gather, they will not find Johnson strange.</p>
<p>▲Hatamen Cigarette Obsession: Johnson has another special hobby, that is, he usually doesn't smoke cigarettes, but if he smokes cigarettes, he must smoke Hatamen cigarettes. Hatamen is a medium-grade tobacco, very cheap, and is smoked by ordinary coolies. It is strange that Johnson is addicted to it. Johnson once told Chinese friends when he came to China again: "China is my second motherland. I feel very happy to come to China this time. One of the reasons for my happiness is that I can taste Hatamen again. Because Hatamen cigarettes are only sold in China, and there is no way to buy them in the United States." Some people explain Johnson's Hatamen obsession by saying that Johnson used to smoke Hatamen cigarettes when he was a student translator in China, so he became addicted. Later, he felt that the taste was still the same as before, so he couldn't help but become addicted.</p>
<h3 id="e184">A Visit to Ye Garden <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ming</p>
<p>It is better to visit the garden when it is sunny. However, the garden after the rain has more flavor to savor. On April 12th, I participated in a visit to Ye Garden initiated by the Youth Association. On this day, the sky was dim, and the chaotic clouds seemed to be raining, but the enthusiasm of the visitors did not diminish. After lunch, we went by car. When we arrived in Jiangwan, the raindrops were already like threads. When we arrived at the garden, the rain was like a tide. The guests all looked for pavilions to shelter from the rain. Between the flying beads and jade, one stone, one flower, one bridge, and one willow were all full of picturesque interest. Its intriguing part is not in the sunny buildings, pavilions, and lakeside pavilions. More than half past two o'clock, tourists gathered on the lawn in the eastern corner of the garden. The person in charge of the Youth Association gave a speech, followed by the national music of the Yousheng Traveling Troupe. I specially led away to the water near the wall to listen to it. The wind passed, and the sound came, not like listening to the sound of the flute in the bamboo under the moon. The music stopped for a gentleman to dance the sword, and the photography was at the end. For a while, the skirts flew, laughing and talking, making people forget the sound of war drums in the Central Plains. Ye Yuan's victory is that in the shade of the bridge and by the water, there are several weeping willows, and several stones lying down between the willows and the waves. If the tourists lift up their clothes and wade in the stream, and stand in the depths of the green waves, they should feel cool and green in the shadow of the small bridge and the chaotic willows in the lake. When I visited Liuyuan in Wuzhong last autumn, I saw artists in Wuzhong painting old trees, horizontal branches, low walls, and chaotic rocks at Yuantouzhu. I also saw people painting flat waves, distant trees, green ridges, and windy sails. However, the customs here are not as good as those of Liangxi in Wuxia. It should be given to the old painter in the spring river, and the green teenagers should not be allowed to open their cameras in their arms and laugh at people. On the way back, I felt inspired and composed a small verse in Lian Yuan to record this Qing tour. Arriving at the door, the rain washes away the fragrance and dust, and the weeping willows condense their green waists. The sound of birds cries, flying catkins fill the courtyard, and a bay of flowing water. Junlu is unrestrained, leaving shadows while walking in the green, and leaning on the painted railing together. Laughter is hurriedly spent picking vegetables, who should be asked to connect with the spring marks? The tender agreement is still remembered. It is so soul-destroying that the curtains are empty and green, crying red and weeping dew, the flowers are dim and the willows are dim, and the two flavors. Try dancing with Wu Gou, wait for Yue Niang to be poured, and Mu Jia will rise again. Another Xiao sings out new sorrows like the sea, and puts the East Wind against him.</p>
<h3 id="e185">A Record of Mr. Li Yie, a Native of Heshan <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shiyuan</p>
<p>In recent years, thanks to the efforts of General Li Jinglin and Committee Members Chu Minyi in promoting martial arts, people everywhere have followed suit and are competing to practice national martial arts as a pleasure. However, Mr. Li Yie, a national martial artist who was highly praised by General Li ten years ago, was also a sharpshooter (Mr. Li was famous for his marksmanship) who once served as the magistrate of Heshan County. Mr. Li was skilled in fighting, somersaulting, and leaping. His movements were as fast as an eagle or falcon. He often wore simple clothing and short jackets. He would adopt a horse-riding posture with his knees forward, and several people could stand on his legs without him showing any sign of strain. He is old, but his spirit is vigorous, just like when he was young. When he governed Heshan County, which was plagued by bandits, for more than a year, the thieves warned each other not to enter. One day, a relative of his was celebrating his son's wedding and sent a letter inviting him to attend the banquet. More than a hundred thieves gathered and rushed forward with shouts. Just as the gatekeeper reported that Mr. Li had arrived, the thieves were all speechless and said, "We've ruined our plan. We can't offend the sharpshooter!" In an instant, they scattered like birds and beasts. Such was Mr. Li's power and people's respect for him.</p>
<p>Five years ago, when Mr. Li heard the news of the death of Sun Yat-sen, the great revolutionary, he wept bitterly. He wrote a eulogy in his own hand: "The Central Plains are troubled, and I grieve in vain" "The mountain and the Big Dipper gaze vainly at the withered sage." The words "Zhongshan" (Sun Yat-sen's name) were incorporated into the couplet, almost seamlessly. I have included it here as a special note.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Chrysanthemum Talk in Tianjin <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting, from Tianjin</p>
<p>I have been in Tianjin for a week, and I have been traveling with my old friend Sha Youtian to sing in the theater. Now I will write down the latest news I have received about the chrysanthemum world.</p>
<p>Yanqiu has shaved his beard and stopped singing in Shanghai. Tianjin also says the same thing, and some say that Cheng (Yanqiu) had no choice but to do so to avoid the limelight of the new Yanqiu. It is inevitable that Yu Shuang will be tarnished. Cheng once came to Tianjin with his chrysanthemum friends Shou Chen and Miaoxiang to perform last month. This statement is self-defeating. Youtian told Yu, "Yanqiu has indeed become ill and fat. The color pants have been let out three times at the waist. His voice is gradually loosening. The wide sounds often contain harsh sounds. He can no longer control his voice as freely as he used to. His appearance has not been damaged. This time, Cheng is very willing to work hard for the sake of his own reputation. As a result, the results are still good." After Cheng returned to Ping, he formed his own team and invited Furongcao to join. The momentum is very strong. Now the Tianjin Butterfly Grand Theater has scheduled Cheng Ling to perform Biyu Zan and Jin Suoji on the evenings of April 19th and 20th. Advertisements have been posted for many days. The words "Cheng Opera" are specially marked to appeal to the public. It can be seen that people are enthusiastically welcoming Yanqiu.</p>
<p>Wang Shaolou is a promising successor to Sheng. His voice is excellent. His singing is very similar to Shuyan. He is very skilled in his body. He acts very seriously. The only thing that is lacking is his recitation. He once performed in Tianjin for a month. He was a big hit. Later, he sang with Xue Yanqin at Chunhe for four days. Tickets were sold out in advance. Tomorrow (the 11th), he will perform with Xue Ling, Shou Chen, and Ruian at Chunhe for three days. The ticket price is as high as two yuan. The plays are Wang Hao's Shen Pan Hong Xue Zhou's Farewell Ji. (first night) Wang Xue's Kill Home. Xue Zhou Hao's Ci Shen. (second night) Zhou Hao's Chang Ban Po. Wang Xue Hao's Famen Temple. (third day) Zhou Hao's Steal the Imperial Horse. Wang Xue's Run Slope Deng Dian. (third night) The grand occasion can be predicted. Huang Quansheng of Shanghai Grand Theater originally wanted to invite Yanqiu to go south, but Cheng allowed him to perform in the second half of the year. Huang then intended to change the contract with Wang Xue or Wang Yu (Cuihua). According to Shaolou, Yu Nanhang is still waiting for the final consideration. He must be sure that he is sure to succeed before he can act. However, in terms of Shaolou's art, this trip will not be unfavorable. If he can bring Tongchui Shuoguo Qiu Guixian together, two unfamiliar faces, they will definitely be seated. Only Danjue needs to be considered.</p>
<p>Fu Ying is singing a farewell commemorative play at the Zhongyuan Company. The attendance is good. Xiaopei is also invited to accompany him in the play "Ganlu Temple" as Qiao Guolao and Lu Su. The Danjue is Hu Bilan, who is praised by the Peilan Society. This Zhi has recently become a disciple of Xiaoyun and sings more solidly and correctly. Among the Kunjue, she is the most pleasant to listen to. However, her smoky face does not seem appropriate. After Fuying's term expires, Zhongyuan has scheduled the martial arts master Yang Xiaolou to sing solo for several days. Then he hired Huisheng or Xiaoyun to take over the team. There will definitely be a lively time at that time.</p>
<p>An Shuyuan has changed from Xinming Theater to Xinxin Stage. This gentleman is well-connected in Tianjin. However, his voice is deteriorating day by day, and many people regret it. In addition, there are the old brand Bangzi of Tianfeng Garden and the Kunban of Kuideshe Theater in Xinxin Theater, which are lined up to rely on marriage and new family dramas. They are all slightly seated. Tian Hua Jing is the territory of the Kunling Qiluan Jiao and Huang Runqing's son, Tongling Binsheng Huang Chu Bao. (Recompense)</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Red Flames Soar to the Sky: the Filial Daughter of Goulan; Red Carpet on the Ground: the Renowned Actress Impromptu</p>
<p>A Jin said: "I didn't expect Miss Wen Guizhi to be so conscientious." "They say she was born as a prostitute." A Bao said: "She is the best prostitute. Those second-rate prostitutes can't compare to her." A Jin said: "I suppose that old woman must be her grandmother." "If she were adopted, how could she be so filial?" A Bao said: "I heard them say that Miss Wen Guizhi's mother died when she was young. She died a month after giving birth to her. Her mother got a postpartum disease. Her grandmother raised her. She never ate well because she was sick since she was born. She was fed a little milk powder. She was raised like this. Her father specializes in drinking and gambling. He sold her in the Jie Er Tang. Fortunately, she was born beautiful. She was also lucky. She jumped to Chang San. So she never forgets her grandmother. This is called being born and raised by herself. She is conscientious after all." They said these two sentences, looking at this Aunt Da and looking at Ruiyun and other purchased servants, and felt that these words were a bit taboo. So they stopped talking. The topic turned to another place, saying: "This time, Miss Wen Gui has suffered a lot of losses. Not to mention the jewelry, they don't have a small house. All the things have to be placed in the business. Even the clothes in the hall will feel unfashionable in a year or two. But when you make them, they are expensive. It is not easy to make all the single-layered cotton and leather clothes now. I don't know if they have insured them. If they have insured them, it would be better after all. Even if the compensation is not enough, half of it will be taken." Aunt Da said: "Who would insure the hall?" "Because we often have to move. We often live for two or three sections and then move to another place. Isn't it troublesome to insure? If you have a small house, it is worth insuring. This year, a customer agreed to me to insure. Looking at this, I have the idea of insuring. It only costs a dozen taels of silver a year. You can insure three thousand taels of silver. It is reassuring." A Bao said: "I heard that Miss Wen Guizhi has a good customer. They say his surname is Yan. Everyone calls him Lord Yan. He is a Daotai. But when he walks, one foot is a bit limping. People also There is a call to him Yan Jiaojiao. It is said that he ate a bullet when he was fighting the East." "This Lord Yan is very rich. Now that the things have been burned, is he afraid that Lord Yan will not compensate her? Today, he just came back from Lord Yan's Tang. With such a good customer, it is better than insurance."</p>

<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Since the move last week, the seats have remained full. It has now been decided to change the repertoire in the fourth week (i.e., the second week after the move). It was originally planned to change to Naoxue, Luhua Dang, Yu Wu, and Dayu Shajia. Now, because the Japanese opera opened last night, the New York newspapers all say that it is not as calm as the Chinese opera. Moreover, the audience here applauds the most for the sword dance and Guifang's exit with a knife. However, the commentators in the newspaper praised Fenhewan Ci Hu. Since our opera has won praise for its calmness, we will certainly work hard on calmness in the future. Therefore, it is planned to change the repertoire. The final decision is as follows: First, the Drunkenness section. Second, Luhua Dang. Third, Xishi's feather dance. Fourth, Dayu Shajia. The above four operas have been carefully considered and rehearsed several times. We will wait for the dress rehearsal on Sunday night and ask people from all walks of life to visit, watch, and criticize.</p>
<p>The opera community recently invited Wan and others to a dinner. More than 500 people attended. Wan gave a speech. The association also presented Wan and all the members of the troupe with honorary membership certificates. This is also a first for the New York Drama Association.</p>
<p>Recently, all the famous actors, both old and young, have come to watch the opera. They all came to the backstage to meet and express their respect. One famous actor said: "A woman's drunkenness is very difficult to watch. Chinese opera can describe it to such an extent. It is really unimaginable." From this, we can know the depth of the Chinese opera organization and the exquisiteness of Mei Jun's art. Several old ladies watched Dayu Shajia and said, "Chinese girls are really good. No matter how unwilling they are, they have to compromise and please their fathers. American girls will never accommodate people." This is probably a feeling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I met with Mr. Yang again. We had a very pleasant conversation. Mr. Yang said: "The organization of Mr. Mei's visit to the United States is the most appropriate. The publicity is also just right. In the past, some foreigners came here and failed because the publicity was excessive and the name did not match the reality. There are quite a few people. This time, all the measures are very appropriate. I will write a letter to China to praise it." Then he asked which newspaper would be appropriate. When he told them that the major newspapers in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Ping could, he said that he would disclose the information in a letter soon. He also said that the appearance of Dayu Shajia was extremely beautiful. It was completely Chinese style. Wan Hua is always friendly, so he also said: "One person has achieved such a great reputation, and is still so humble. How can he not become a world figure? I admire this very much. And American famous actors are often complacent and arrogant. But this time they are not proud of Mr. Mei at all."</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai bond market saw a total turnover of 19,700 yuan in spot trading. Excluding the reorganization loan, which accounted for 13,700 yuan, other bonds only amounted to a few thousand yuan. The futures market was far from its previous activity.

<h3 id="e195">Yarn and Flower: The Yarn Market Remains in Chaos <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, with an extremely scattered trend. This is due to the unfavorable environment, many rumors in the current situation, and weak investor sentiment. Sales of current yarn are becoming increasingly bleak, primarily due to the impending deadline, leading to a generally bearish outlook. However, major buyers are holding firm and unwilling to loosen their grip, even showing interest in taking delivery. Simultaneously, short sellers are aggressively seeking out current yarn in the market, creating intense competition between the bulls and bears. Based on the overall trend, the price of 512 at 32 taels temporarily appears to have the possibility of stabilizing.</p>
<p>▲ Futures Yarn Falls and Rises Again: Pre-market opening saw the shorts cover 1,000 bales of ten-count yarn from the previous day, causing investor sentiment to loosen and selling pressure to increase, with prices for each month falling by 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, and 0.7 mace. In the afternoon, buyers saw that the current month's pre-market closing had reached the limit price of 52 taels, so they purchased another 200 bales, slightly shaking market sentiment. Retail investors covered their short positions, causing prices to rebound by 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 mace. However, trading was sparse, with a total daily turnover of only 6,400 lots.</p>
<p>Closing Price Change Balance Closing Price Change Balance</p>

<p>June 1521  132,100 September 1532   8,450</p>
<p>▲ Spot Yarn Sales Are Less Than 500 Bales: Yesterday, due to the closure of the Western Concession, trading was scarce. Various guilds purchased only 410 bales, with local merchants taking in 100 bales. Market conditions were flat. Among the visiting guilds, the inland guilds were the most active, taking 175 bales. In addition, Fujian took 60 bales, Qinhuangdao took 15 bales, Yantai took 40 bales, Guangdong took 20 bales, Ningbo took 20 bales, Sichuan took 20 bales, and miscellaneous guilds took 40 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Recent Cotton Shows Signs of a Short Squeeze <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>▲Although Actual Demand Is Clear... Market Prices Are Unlikely to Ease Excessively</p>
<p>The cotton market is slightly weak. Although American cotton has fallen, Shanghai cotton prices are unlikely to ease excessively, so the trend remains tight, mainly because of a shortage of underlying goods. Japanese merchants are holding firm this month and are unwilling to let go, and there is talk of a short squeeze. The attitude of the Hankou merchants is also firm.</p>
<p>▲ Futures Cotton Is Firm in the Near Term and Weak in the Long Term: The pre-market opening in the Hankou market followed the decline in foreign cotton, and retail investors closed their positions, causing prices to fall by 0.5 fen to 1.5 mace. In the afternoon, market sentiment rebounded slightly, with the long-term months being flat and the near-term months rebounding by 1.5 mace. Total daily turnover was 17,100 piculs. The closing prices for the Hankou market are recorded on the left:</p>

<p>5 35 Up 1.0 81,100 8     000</p>
<p>▲ Spot Sales Are Slack and Dull: Spot cotton business remains quiet. Factories still have no purchasing volume, and there are 300 bales of ordinary cotton and 41 bales of Yao cotton arriving at the docks. Sales are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton 35.25 to 35.50 Shanghai factories took in 300 pieces of spot goods to send to the factory.</p>

<p>▲ English and Indian Cotton Show a Slight Rebound</p>
<p>▲ American Cotton Lacks Buyers: Yesterday, the American cotton market was weak due to a lack of major buyers, profit-taking, and poor cloth market conditions. Futures fell by 9 to 11 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. English cotton futures rose by 12 to 14 points, and spot prices rose by 18 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 25 points. The Indian cotton market was firm, with exporters buying and brokers selling. Fair Goods rose by 5 rupees, forward contracts rose by 3 rupees, Omra rose by 4 rupees, forward contracts rose by 5 rupees, and White Goods rose by 4 rupees, forward contracts rose by 3 rupees.

<h3 id="e198">Grain: River Rice Market Languishes <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, there were very few ships arriving from various guilds, and sales suddenly turned sluggish. Changbang white japonica rice was weak due to poor buying interest, down a few cents. Zhongguan secondary japonica rice was also slow. Recently, ordinary japonica rice prices have changed very quickly, with market transactions fluctuating by one or two cents. The overall market situation felt weak and tired. Thin rice and early rice were originally firm, but now there are few customers. Although river stocks are not large, the atmosphere is weakening, and prices have been slightly reduced. Yangdu pointed rice sales were flat in the morning, and goods were also scarce. The overall market was soft in the midst of stability. At noon, it was heard that foreign rice was doing well again. In general, local indica rice is not easy to sell. Metamorphosed Yuan Yin rice is also dull. Sales are limited, and the market is short by nearly a cent.</p>
<p>▲ Huinan: There are also few sources from the river, but market sales are not smooth. High-quality machine-milled japonica rice sales are quiet, and transactions are very small. Su Tong machine-milled japonica rice sales are still acceptable, but buyers are eager to cut prices, while sellers are unwilling to reduce prices. Initially, there was an appearance of mutual rejection. Then, due to the soft report from the Zhabei market, there was a slight reduction in wholesale prices. However, in fact, japonica rice prices here are difficult to fall back. Thin rice and southern early rice sources are scarce, sales are normal, and market conditions are slightly flat in the afternoon. Currently, after the establishment of the Peace Preservation Committee, buyers are mostly watching and waiting. Yangdu pointed rice arrivals are few, and the market is very stable. Coupled with the support of foreign rice, the situation is still good. Buying interest in hundred-yuan rice is deserted, with only sporadic transactions. Currently, because underlying goods are not strong, the overall market is dull and stable.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Flour: Near-Term Decline, Long-Term Rise <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning without price fluctuations, remaining unchanged until the afternoon. The current month was weak due to ongoing sales and a lack of investor confidence, with most transactions being closing positions. However, distant months rose because inland buyers generally believed that after the sudden hot weather, the weather would change again, and distant months would therefore become more expensive. As a result, customer sentiment turned strong, and buying interest was very active, causing prices to remain high. As a result, the current month was down 0.25 cents compared to the previous day, May and June were up 0.75 cents, July was up 1 cent, August was up 1 cent, and September was up 0.75 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Far-Term Wheat: Inland Buyers Are Very Eager <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, futures wheat was lackluster due to slight declines in foreign wheat, and investor sentiment was depressed. The lowest price for June and July was about 0.2 cents lower than the previous day, and other months saw little fluctuation. However, when the afternoon market opened, the current month remained stable, and distant months rallied because inland customers were very eager to buy, gradually buying step by step with their great economic power, so the market recovered from weakness. However, there is ultimately a limit to the market value of new wheat. If prices are raised step by step, it is not appropriate in reality. As a result, the current month was unchanged, June was up 1 cent, July and August were unchanged, and September was up 2 cents. Spot wheat prices were flat and weak because only Fuxin and Lu continued to take over, while other factories remained unchanged. The asking price for Qing, Qian, Pu wheat, Nansu wheat, Yaowan wheat, and Bengbu wheat was 5.1 yuan, Shashi wheat was 4.87 yuan, and 4.77 yuan, totaling 4,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Foreign Rice: Weak in the Morning, Strong in the Afternoon <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, foreign rice was very weak due to the arrival of spot goods and the weak market sentiment from the previous day. Then, customers from the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and Jiangbei and other guilds made inquiries, and the market turned from weak to strong. Although prices did not rise or fall, the market atmosphere was already tight. For futures, various inland guilds inquired, but foreign firms did not sell due to the holiday. The market only squeezed about 1,000 tons of the current month at a price of 7.16 yuan, which was a new transaction. There were also more than 1,000 tons of returned goods, but the market improved by one or two cents because foreign firms did not sell and inland customers inquired.</p>
<h3 id="e202">Soybean Market Continues to Weaken <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market continued to weaken, with successive declines in contract prices and sluggish sales. Oil mills were also slow to purchase due to poor oil sales, with only small mills and workshops making slight inquiries. Inland guilds also watched and waited because transportation was not cost-effective due to low inland prices. Only two cars of Ping Ge Lian Yuan were opened, priced at 5.412 yuan, while the standard was also 0.2 cents lower, opening at 0.41 yuan. The market was flat and weak.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Silk and Tea: Tunxi Tea and Dexing Tea Recent News <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>▲ Tunxi Tea Firms Are Not As Lively As In Previous Years</p>
<p>▲ Dexing Tea Firms Cannot Open Due To Banditry</p>
<p>▲ Tunxi: The annual export volume of Anhui's Tunxi green tea is about 120,000 chests or more. There are about 70 or more tea firms. Although it was burned and looted by Zhu bandits last spring, the losses of tea merchants were relatively small. The original tea firms were able to open in time and did not decrease. Unexpectedly, the impact of the Russian Association's suspension of Chinese tea affected the unsold Gongxi Zhenmei chest tea stored in Shanghai last winter. Most ended with more losses than profits. This year's new tea will soon be on the market. The number of Tunpu tea firms preparing to open is not as lively as in previous years. In addition, due to sluggish financial conditions and high prices, most of the tea firms are waiting and watching, and the market is showing a rather bleak scene.</p>
<p>▲ Dexing: Gan Province's Dexing is a rich tea-producing area. No less than 30,000 chests of tea are produced each year. Gaozhuang Zhenmei is sold for more than 100 taels. Merchants in the area are gradually becoming more aware of the importance of operating foreign green tea, and the number of tea firms is also increasing year by year. However, it has been ravaged by communist bandits in recent years. Most of the tea leaves cannot be picked and processed in time, and production has declined. Although some people ventured to operate in Dexi, Haikou, and Huanshui last year, they all suffered losses. This year, the tea firms in Dexing dare not prepare to open because the remaining bandits are still lingering and have not been cleared, and it is difficult to handle the transportation of tea funds. The canning factory established in Germany last year has now moved to Taibai in Wujing. Tea firms with ample capital are even more reluctant to operate. If the bandit atmosphere does not subside next month, the Dexing tea market may disappear invisibly.</p>

<p>▲ The YMCA Declares: The Advanced Wireless Electricity Specialty School of this Association has been established for several years. No less than several hundred graduates have served in various places with outstanding achievements, and have long been praised by all sectors of society. In addition to installing long and short wave transceivers, this term also hired Mr. Pan, a professor of wireless electricity, to enthusiastically guide the students, and the results are even more remarkable. Recently, Mr. Pan independently produced a long-wave broadcasting machine and installed it in the transmission room for students in the department to use for experiments. The chairman of the department, Mr. Wang Xun, has now held a meeting to discuss and assign broadcasting work. The broadcasting time is temporarily set from 4:00 to 4:30 pm, 8:30 to 9:00 pm every day, 1:00 to 3:00 pm on Saturdays, and 10:00 to 11:00 am on Sundays. In addition, famous Shanghai ticket friends are specially invited to sing their best works. The call sign is XGO, and the wavelength is tentatively set at 338 meters. The programs broadcast are all famous Chinese and Western records, and it has been decided to officially start broadcasting on the 14th. All those who have radios installed in this city can receive it. It is a major advancement in China's wireless broadcasting industry.</p>
<p>▲ Mr. Wang Kanghou, Bachelor of Laws, who used to be the secretary of Lawyer Dong Kang, graduated from Soochow University Law School and compiled a new theory of American constitutional law. He has now been issued a lawyer's certificate by the Judicial Administration Department of the National Government and has set up an office at No. 1 Tianjili, Baoshan Road, and will start working on the 20th.</p>
<p>▲ The Higher School of Transportation and Automobile Engineering Declares: Since the school's opening, the number of students has increased day by day. The original Baylor Road school building is not enough. A second school building has now been established at No. 402, next to the Shenfubao Road Zhenhua Tangyang Cloth Guild. In order to promote the cohesion of the students, the students specially organized a student entertainment association, which is divided into entertainment, sports, etc., to adjust the comfort of their bodies and minds.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Business News <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>▲ The China Industrial Bank Declares: This bank has been established for many years with sufficient capital and well-known credit. Therefore, business is developing day by day. The old site is not enough for office use. A new seven-story building has been built on Beijing Road, which is large in scale and magnificent in architecture. It is scheduled to move in and start working on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>▲ As summer is approaching and the weather is getting hotter, all kinds of seasonal medicines will be launched in turn. This year's Donghuo Mudan's wholesale price has increased sharply due to the rising gold price. This has a considerable impact on the cost of sales. Those who sell this product are all afraid of losing money, and they all hold a wait-and-see attitude. However, the medicinal power and efficacy of Shengdan produced by Jiufu Company in this city are not inferior to a certain Mudan. As it is completely a domestic product, this year's wholesale price has not only not increased at all, but also newly established ordering methods have increased the interests of various sales companies. In addition, the company does not hesitate to sacrifice and set up a one-yuan trial sales method, so that merchants in remote towns and villages can also sell it. This move has greatly increased the sales power of various sales families. Therefore, those who order and try to sell Shengdan in various places have recently sprung up like mushrooms, and the company is working day and night to catch up. This is good news for the future of domestic products and is also welcome by those who promote health.</p>
<p>▲ The Hanli Company Declares: The Qiyayun Printing Machine newly invented by Zhong Lingjun has been praised and adopted by all sectors of society. Because the company's original old site on Sichuan Road is not enough, it has moved to the new site at No. 161 Wangping Street for business. In recent days, visitors and buyers have been coming and going in an endless stream. The company's employees are overwhelmed. The company has received urgent telegrams from all over the place ordering products, and Zhong Ling himself is supervising the work in the factory day and night to catch up.</p>
<p>▲ Shunfeng Stockings Factory Declares: The factory's stockings are an outstanding product in the domestic knitting industry. Its advantages lie in its moderate tightness, suitable for both thin and fat people. Even after being worn and sold, it will never pill or fade. Among domestic products, there is no one better than it. In the past, the products of this factory were sold through other companies, so they could not trade directly with customers. Now, in order to meet the needs of society, this factory has specially set up the first sales outlet at No. 547 Qipan Street, north of the Sanmao Pavilion Bridge. In addition to issuing the factory's products, it also sells global department stores. The opening is scheduled for April 20th in the national calendar, and all goods will be discounted for 14 days. I think there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<p>▲ The New Moon Record Company Declares: Last year, this company specially sent technicians to Hong Kong to record on a large scale, and hired famous Cantonese opera stars and famous musicians from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai at a high price to record new films. The great work was completed this spring. The novelty of the accent and the clarity and beauty of the music of the various films produced are very different from before. According to General Manager Qian Guangren, this recording is the most perfect since the recording. Now, all parties are ordering one after another, and there is a trend of demand exceeding supply. It is estimated that the new films in this city can also be released in the next two days.</p>
<p>▲ Lihua Company on Nanjing Road Declares: The music department on the third floor of this company has recently arrived with a large number of Cantonese songs, such as Liao Liaoliao's Bad Book Reading and The Sword of the Record, Da Sha Xi Ganchi's Salt Warehouse Master, Da Sha Couple's Foolish Master's Four Sentences, Li Suolan's Chase Goddess, Lu Wencheng and Xi Ganchi's Liaoxi Meng Hua Xin Carrot, Da Sha Couple's Chicken Sister Doctor Jiudong, Cui Mubai's Drunken Moon in the Painting Building, Spring is Gone, etc., which are beautiful and priced very cheaply.</p>

<p>▲ The Youth Chinese Medicine Association Declares: This association recognizes that ancient medical records generally value literature and do not pay attention to facts. I don’t know that the cause and effect changes of diseases are not superficial in terms of pathology and medicine. Therefore, a monthly magazine of modern famous doctors’ case studies has been compiled, and Mr. Ye Jinqiu, a doctor from Jiashan, has been hired as the editor-in-chief. It uses a scientific perspective, novel text, interesting writing, and a realistic photography. The first issue has already been published.

Recently, due to the mild weather, the disease has broken out greatly, so a large number of ringworm medicines are available on the market. Each bottle only sells for 25 cents. The western medicine department of Wing On Company sells it.</p>
