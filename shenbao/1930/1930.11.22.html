<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 蘭茜</p>
<p>在荆棘叢中行路的人常不爲荆棘所剌傷爲了他們曉得自已所處的是什麽地位而知所提防</p>
<p>人生是盲目的愛情也是盲目的一切人類的作爲都是盲目的所分别者只在於他們的心境是否清明而已</p>
<p>假如我們承認人生只是一塲大夢那麽這夢境是何等様的使我們心驚胆戰啊</p>
<p>你應該知所憎然後才知所愛愛憎雖相爲矛盾然而頗有關連愛之深則憎之漸憎之深則愛之漸</p>
<p>戀愛有無形中的市塲這幾乎像是貿易但不能大减價戀愛打起折扣來你應該感到極端的痛苦眞摰的愛情不能以金錢買得要用你的眞情換取</p>
<p>在人生的過程中只如在一條崎嶇不平的路上走着有人謹愼地　過這險境有人於不自覺中墮落黑暗之淵</p>
<p>戀愛會使你於疲倦中興奮也會使積極進取的人寒心葡萄美酒不能醉人只使你輕鬆適意戀愛却能沈醉你的終身</p>
<p>許多少男少女都因誤解戀愛而鬧出許多悲劇戀愛所賜與他們的不是苦痛而是一種好的教訓</p>
<p>造物者所賦予我們的愛情有限在未有得到你所由衷慕愛的人時你對於愛情切忌濫用因爲愛情用完了時煩惱就緊跟在你的後頭</p>

<h3>四大學英語演說競賽之花絮</h3>
<p>— 程志政</p>
<p>四大學英語演說竸賽爲交通·曁南·光華·復旦四校所組合而成一年一度未嘗或間本年度則假交通大學文治堂舉行評判員如吳經熊博士·劉雲舫·李道南·黃漢樑夫人·陳立廷等皆社會聞人十九日下午交大已車水馬龍擁擠萬分文治堂中但見萬頭攢動無復𨻶地茲擇記經過趣屑以實本談</p>
<p>約法二章　文治堂門首揭示規章兩條頗爲别致一日（在演講時不得出入）一曰（在演講後不得鼓掌）前者殆恐秩序紊亂致演講員精神不能專注後者蓋懼感情用事礙及公正人之判斷力設想之周實屬難能亦大足爲其他演講比賽之效法也</p>
<p>大談戀愛科學　各代表之講題頗有饒有趣味者女代表二人之題目均爲婦女問題交大朱耀貞女士爲（婦女體育）光華陳美珥女士爲（眞正婦女）引起聽者不少注意最妙者厥爲復旦彭啓炘君其講題爲（戀愛科學之切要）於是援古證今大談其戀愛謂戀愛如不以科學方法研究之决難獲得圓滿結果等語一時聞者無不軒渠</p>
<p>女將軍頭角崢嶸　此次參加之女代表二人成績均極可取光華陳美珥議論風生震驚四座交大朱耀貞女士態度之佳聲調之美實屬罕見聞女士平日練習極勤於晨光熹微中即登壇誦習吳經熊博士於致其個人評語時讚不絶口譽爲極有希望之演說家聞在交大初賽時曾獲個人第一</p>
<p>吳博士妙語如珠　給獎前由吳經熊博士致詞博士謂適纔某君暢論戀愛科學以後當請其指教指教本人不會演講惟覺中國人而說英語實一缺憾否則今日鄙人用寗波官話致詞當更好聽云云又謂某君聲浪太低幾如對人耳語余在後排非用電話實聽不見聞者絶倒</p>
<p>陳立廷自慚形穢　青年會總幹事陳立廷氏是日於評判終了後即行退席乃未出文治堂之門特被主席召回請其給獎陳致詞中云向來給獎者必爲美麗女士受者亦感覺無上榮耀今日主席囑鄙人給獎鄙人旣非女士且面貌亦爲諸君所共賞實覺異常慚媿云結果光華大學獲得冠軍得銀杯及錦旗各一</p>
<p>女賓獨多　是日會塲中女賓甚多衣香鬢影爲會塲生色不少事後調查始悉此大批女賓實爲光華大學學生前來爲女同學陳美珥助威者光華旣得錦標乃無不面呈笑容歡然歸去</p>

<h3>南洋游記（七九）</h3>
<p>— 靈花</p>
<p>二十七早到仰光已入印度界矣仰光本缅甸一埠久成英屬印度之一省今缅人力爭分治雖已分治而政教文化完全印度式與東亞逈殊矣至此已另成一世界與前者異一緬甸爲純粹佛教國千餘年至今二緬甸爲女人地位甚高之國三緬甸雖爲印度化而其上緬北部接近雲南片馬各地與中國交際頗多中緬以北雲南人頗不少因之雲南佛教亦甚盛其最著者有接近雲南之雞足山吳梅村詩有云（普洱與蒼山佛教之鄒魯）句可知雲南與緬甸佛化之關係也初住名利棧即訪龍華寺道階法師乃余初受戒師也師任北平法源寺方丈多年</p>
<p>該寺爲清帝受戒之所前年歡迎太戈爾于此法師游緬久均有日記于雲南交界上緬中緬遊跡周遍于中國關係之歷史緬甸民情均有甚深調查與研究曾兩遊印度据云緬甸藏經甚豐富應聘人翻譯尼泊爾藏經亦富佛像優美爲各地冠錫蘭佛像甚美備尤過於仰光也</p>
<p>此時在緬甸已入雨季矣終日下雨而各塔廟例不論何人入廟必須脫鞋脫鞋乃緬人神聖之禮前曾述英官吏因不脫鞋釀成大變者道階法師乃述其詳乃在緬之故京馬德拉華云瓦城者英武官一旅長因不脫鞋與僧衝突被僧以以刀傷其面乃捕七八僧緬僧民大反抗結果訴諸英倫英皇乃批云我國臣民所到各國應遵守各國習慣風俗禮節不應不脫鞋于是緬人訴訟勝利全緬民氣大振吾於此可知英人撫懷小國之本領也其雄視諸族非偶然矣此後凡人一人廟界雖不進内亦須脫鞋其大金塔聞只汪精衛過緬時特許不脫鞋而豋臨一次然其事亦在緬人與英武官訴訟未勝利之前也</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（八十一）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>巡游意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（四）</p>
<p>不死之城—La　ville　eternelle</p>
<p>六月一日西班牙名作展與日本現代畫展三六（耶穌被迫解衣El　Espolio這是格萊可最負盛名最有價値的大作一千五百七十九年完成是Toledo伽藍的神殿的裝飾畫羣集而複雜的武士表出異常嚴重的様式基督及其使徒充溢着沈鬰慘淡的面相全部是青與黃青與綠綠與紅橙與青青與紅單純的二色間的配合</p>
<p>四一（聖馬當之贈衣）這是一種强烈悲愴之對照一種病的興奮的感覺表現是内部生命深入的非凡的描寫</p>
<p>在西班牙承繼格萊可而爲畫派的宗師的是委拉士貴士Velasquez他擅長消像</p>
<p>畫一六二三年之後到瑪獨利爲宮廷畫家因呂班士的敦勸游意大利二次臨摹</p>
<p>了許多蒂湘的畫他受蒂湘及黎阜拉Ribera的影響之後而完成他的寫實主義他自從與威尼斯派畫家接觸之後成熟至速因他們的影響而轉變他的作風不久他就成功傳逹自然的眞實的畫家雖然他是畫宮廷的莊麗的肖像畫家同時他又是愛畫殘廢的人以及勞働階級的畫在這次展覽會有他不少的肖像畫和臨摹蒂湘的畫是法國從來没有見過的他色彩之輕靈透明而富於空氣的遠近法在他以前是未有如此完成的境地的</p>
<p>谷牙Goya是十八世紀未世界的大畫家他一方面保持西班牙之傳統一方面爲印象派的先鋒他躍動而豪放的筆鋒都能打動那生命的力而爲現柋藝術的根基</p>
<p>宗教畫家摩利羅Morilo是受富倫特畫派影響最濃厚之一人他雖然是委拉士貴的弟子但是他們的畫風是絶然不同的</p>

<p>行車情形上海北站於得悉事變訊後因由滬開京之夜特别快車適已開出乃亟急電南翔令其停止前進並命將原車退回北站所有乘客准期照價退票而昨晨由滬開往無錫常州崑山安亭等處之上行區間車及由常錫崑安等處開滬之下行區間車均暫停行駛但京滬間及京杭通車仍照常行駛惟旅客乘車至肇事地點後須下車步行數十碼再換乘另一列車方可到逹目的地故昨日一日間各車時刻竟可謂無從捉摸乘客方面亦祗准携帶輕便行李昨晚滬杭路原定下午五時五十分由滬開杭之十號通快車因待京滬通車乘客致延至下午九時許始行開出昨晚十一時由滬開京及由京開滬之夜特别快車因乘客擁擠特别開一次今日起各車准照常行駛云</p>

<h3>温州閙捐風潮影響上海航業貨運</h3>
<p>碼頭工人已罷工貨運阻斷遷延不决將激生罷市風潮温州因增加洋廣貨稅各商家爭相反對而激生罷運風潮此事雙方各不相讓致風潮擴大而上海之商業航運亦受重大損失茲將此事詳情續再查報如下</p>
<p>洋廣改征統捐本月十六日温州之洋廣貨稅捐局奉令併入永嘉統捐局乃該局接收洋廣稅務以後即宣布從十七日起温州洋廣貨捐變更辦法廢止舊章改作統捐征收稅額由局通告洋廣貨業各商家得訊以洋廣稅輕而統捐稅重一經認征商家之担負須增加百分之二十至三十由是由該業召集同行公决一致反對請求勿更原制而其結果該捐局對於非洋廣貨之統稅因增比例同時亦宣布須酌加成數商界對此兩重風潮一時並發而乃有罷運等事之抵制也</p>
<p>各業罷連抵制從十七日起洋廣貨業之配貨出口乃首先停止至十八日因稅局對此事仍堅持原議不肯通融其他各業亦一致加入罷運當經組織請免增稅團惟恐有一二奸商私自倫運乃令各輪碼頭小工與裝卸帮工人自十七日起一律罷工使貨件不能上落温州運　至是乃完全阻斷矣</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>風潮愈閙愈大自十八日起各商業代表假商會開議兩日希望稅局停止變更統捐增加稅率而函次請求未能得到稅局同意據昨日温州來電謂各業商現在情勢已漸次惡化罷市危機頗有一觸即發之勢矣</p>
<p>上海去貨問題招商局之廣濟輪昨日已放空船還滬用三十五噸泥砂壓艙抵申以後之去貨問題尚未確定因洋廣貨不能裝往即其他貨件之能否運去祇以該埠工人業已罷業此問題不解决恐貨件裝去亦無法出卸故廣濟輪之出口貨裝載與否尚須守候温州來電方能確定但因船期係屬正班故必須開去</p>
<p>滬輪損失不小當此年關將届温州貨運正在赶裝之際突然發生罷運風潮業已多日上海往温州一路現有廣濟海晏益利等三輪又有摩托帆船四艘刻下均因無貨裝載放空回滬今次廣濟未運來貨已損失水脚二千餘兩又海晏輪亦將放空返申其帆船之因無貨裝載而停行者損失亦甚巨大也滬上商家之在温定貨待運到申而遭阻停者更形焦灼而赴輪公司之探詢者紛紛不絶</p>

<p>新洲增置險燈九江以上在火燄山附近之淺灘暗礁時起變化當此淺水期内輪行更覺危險略爲不愼即遭擱礁失事昨日江漢關通知上海各輪公司略謂在最淺險之新洲暗礁淺灘已經設置報險燈船用作指示上下水各江輪之標準凡長江船經行該地須照此警燈百分之五英里行駛方可免除水淺時肇禍夫事之危險矣</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Italy Implements Militarism</h3>
<p>Today, in this era of democratic development and at a time when world peace is highly advocated, it is truly not good news for the future of the world that Italy alone proclaims militarism as its banner. Italy originally implemented a universal compulsory conscription system, where people serve in the military from the age of 21 and undergo military training. Statistics show that the total period of military service is 19 years, which cannot be said to be not paying attention to military affairs. However, the principle of militarism passed by the Italian cabinet today requires men who are 18 years old to receive military training so that the new recruits who join the army, navy, and air force each year will be people who have already received training. In fact, it is tantamount to serving two years earlier. To put it bluntly, the reason why they are so anxious to implement this militarism is to develop their club-law (fascist) ideology and realize their plan to make all soldiers in the country soldiers who uphold the club-law ideology. In addition to the formal army, Italy also has so-called volunteer militias, which are organized by volunteers over the age of 17, with a quota of 300,000. They are a unique army in Italy, commanded by Prime Minister Mussolini, and are nominally maintained for public security, but in reality, they are maintained to uphold the club-law ideology. Mr. Mussolini still thinks this is not enough, and he is still afraid that those who oppose the club-law will destroy his policies, so he must make all soldiers in the country soldiers who uphold the club-law before the opponents of the club-law in the country will have no room to stand. His ambition is really shocking. Recently, Mr. Mussolini has made constant and vigorous remarks about the current situation. Those who praise him say that he has the determination and perseverance to bear the mission of guiding the club-law ideology to spread throughout Europe, so that Italy can always occupy the position of a first-class country in the world, unlike politicians in other countries who only use empty words of peace and cooperation to cover up their weaknesses. Those who doubt Mr. Mussolini's ideology say that his words and deeds are enough to disrupt the world and are more dangerous than explosive bombs, with the fear of blasting the hope of world peace into nothing. What will the result be? Those with insight will be able to judge clearly.</p>

<h3>Continued Indian Round Table Conference Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Full of Federal Autonomy Atmosphere</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - The amended proposals of the committees will be submitted to the Indian Round Table Conference upon the conclusion of the plenary session. Proponents advocate the establishment of a Federal Relations Committee to consider the structure of the federal government on the relationship between the princely states and British India, and the relationship between the local governments and British India and the central government. In addition to considering the structure, it will also formulate the main principles for application.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - The Indian Round Table Conference held its fourth plenary session this morning. It first passed a resolution limiting each speech to ten minutes. Twenty-five delegates have prepared speeches, but they will not be able to finish today and must be extended to tomorrow. Former Indian Viceroy, Marquis of Reading, said that the British policy contained in the introduction to the 1919 Government of India Act, to gradually allow India to participate in various administrations and develop its autonomous organs, with the aim of achieving responsible government in British India and becoming an integral part of the British Empire, would naturally result in India achieving a status equal to that of other autonomous regions. The British Liberal Party fully agrees with this, but to say at this time that India can have something similar to the equal status of an autonomous region is unfounded. He acknowledged that the East is rising rapidly and wants to surpass the West. He is amazed at this speed and hopes that this conference can establish the principle of an all-India federation. The next speaker was one of the two Indian female delegates, Ms. Jehanara Shahnawaz, whose father was Muhammad Shafi. Ms. Shahnawaz wore a light green dress and diamonds glittered in her hair. Ms. Shahnawaz said that she is a Muslim woman who has now abandoned the seclusion of women and come to London with Mrs. Subbarayan, a Hindu woman, to participate in this conference. This fact alone shows that the so-called conservative East is no longer immutable. She supports the proposal for an all-India federation and hopes that Indian women will soon gain the freedom of speech and action and be the same as Western women, but with the restrictions learned from the East. This is the idea of Indian women, she said. After Ms. Shahnawaz finished speaking, there was great applause. Chairman MacDonald wrote a congratulatory note and sent it to her. The Maharaja of Bhopal said that the conflict between Hindus and Muslims is not seen in the princely states, but in British India. The reason is purely political. Once the foundation of India's autonomous constitution is laid, this kind of disagreement will definitely disappear on its own. Mr. Joshi, a representative of the Indian labor community, said that the struggle of workers to improve their living conditions will have a greater chance of success when India becomes an autonomous region. Sir A. P. Patro, a representative of British India, said that the attitude of the Indian princes has made the official documents of the Indian government outdated. Do not listen to Viceroy Irwin's declaration that India's autonomy should not be realized immediately. The Maharaja of Nawanagar said that only a federation can achieve the equality of autonomous region status. For the sake of the interests of Britain and India, it is appropriate to quickly recognize India's right to autonomy within the British Empire and there should be no more doubts. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar, a representative of the oppressed classes, said that the oppressed classes want autonomous region status with guarantees attached. Khwaja Hasan Khan, a representative of the Northwest Province, said that threatening Britain is indeed useless, but India should have equal rights. As the saying goes, even a louse in the pants can make you uncomfortable. This is true. Sethna, a Parsi representative, said that India will never be satisfied without autonomous region status. In the transition period, there may be some guarantees. Sethna also refuted Lord Peel's remarks on Tuesday, citing several incidents in recent years where Europeans have been given preferential treatment, which is equivalent to granting them a monopoly. He hopes that when the participants bring a constitution back to India, Indian and European merchants can work side by side for the welfare of Britain, India, and the Empire. Sethna spoke at length and had exceeded the time limit, but still wanted to continue speaking. Chairman MacDonald stopped him. V. S. Srinivasa Sastri, the former agent of the Government of India to South Africa, stood up and said that two proposals have been discovered from the debate: autonomous region status and a federal system. Autonomous region status seems to have been recognized by the spokespersons of the British Conservative and Liberal parties. As for the proposal for an all-India federation, it is relatively new. He originally opposed it, but now he has approved it. (Applause) The sincerity, patience, and gentleness of the words of the Indian princes have caused him to change his initial plans. He hopes that when the major plans are submitted to the subcommittees for handling, there should be no actions that favor the federation and weaken autonomous region status, or favor autonomous region status and weaken the federation. Many British people are deeply concerned that the political organs created by this conference will be taken over by the Indian National Congress. The convening of this conference is due to the serious situation in India, and this serious situation was created by the Indian National Congress. He believes that the British have reason for this concern, so Indian representatives must tell the British how to eliminate their concerns or tell them that their concerns are unfounded. Is the purpose of this conference not to appease the people who are worried about causing trouble? In fact, these people are neither bandits nor savages, nor enemies of the British. They are people with education and honor, and most of them are successful in their careers. They are our compatriots in spirit and blood, but they are placed in a position where we dare not trust them. There is only one thought of political grief. Remove their grievances and you will see them cooperate to implement the constitution that we are now drafting. The power of the current situation lies in this. It is not difficult to turn enemies into friends. Chairman tried hard to end the debate today, but there were still five people who had not finished their speeches, so the plenary session will be held again tomorrow. At that time, Chairman, British Prime Minister MacDonald, will speak to conclude it.</p>

<h3>Italian Cabinet Passes Special Bill</h3>
<p>To Implement Military Principles: All Men Must Receive Military Training at the Age of Eighteen Societa Nazionale, Rome, 20th - Today, the Italian Cabinet passed a special bill to implement military principles, ordering that all men in the country must receive military training after the age of eighteen, so that all new recruits who enlist in the navy, army, and air force each year will be people who have already received training.</p>
<p>Societa Nazionale, Rome, 20th - The Italian Air Force has drafted a bill to reorganize the air force, abolishing army aircraft because their cost is too high and their effectiveness in wartime is not worth the cost.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Another Cabinet Reshuffle in the British Labor Party</h3>
<p>Conservatives to Impeach the Government Societa Nazionale, London, 20th - Although rumors of a British Cabinet reshuffle have been repeatedly denied by the authorities, more and more people here believe it, because recent investigations and the development of events have made the leaders of the Conservative, Liberal, and Labor parties feel that closer cooperation is needed to deal with unemployment and the decline in expenditure. Therefore, it is expected that there will be a major reorganization of the current Cabinet soon.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 20th - Conservative leaders have notified the House of Commons that they will soon introduce a motion to impeach the government because the government has failed to put forward effective methods to expand imperial trade and because the government has refused to consider the methods proposed by overseas autonomous regions.</p>
<h3>German Administrative Council Passes Government Financial Proposals</h3>
<p>Curtius Reports on Diplomatic Situation Reuters, Berlin, 20th - The German Administrative Council today unanimously passed the budget and a new salary reduction bill. Foreign Minister Dr. Curtius reported on the diplomatic situation, mentioning the possibility of Germany demanding a halt to current payments under the Young Plan, saying that Germany does not want to destroy the Young Plan, but has never guaranteed that the Young Plan is feasible. No one can know whether the reform measures stipulated to reorganize German finances are sufficient. No one can know whether Germany can use the international regulations on protecting German economic life (referring to the suspension of cash payments) contained in the contract. As for the issue of disarmament, he is very skeptical of French Prime Minister Tardieu's statement that France has greatly reduced its military since the end of the European War. Germany demands the rapid convening of a disarmament conference. At that time, Germany's request for various countries to disarm, so that various countries have the same security, can be finally decided. As for the revision of the peace treaty, Germany does not regard the current situation, especially the situation in the East, as acceptable by default. This has long been known to all countries.</p>

<h3>Preparations for Wuhan to Welcome Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>Liu Yinggu Passes Through Wuhan to Discuss Xiang Affairs A Hankou correspondence discussing the affairs of Hunan after the suppression of the Communists in the Xiang, E, and Gan provinces, with Pingjiang, Liuyang, and Jinshi successively recaptured, and Ji'an and Yudu in Gan province also recaptured in turn. The remaining bandits in counties such as Huangpi and Jianshi in E province can be wiped out in the shortest possible time. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek is also scheduled to arrive in Wuhan within days to supervise the suppression of the bandits. In the past, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek ended the war in Henan province and transferred heavy troops to station in the Xiang, Gan, and E provinces to suppress the bandits, and ordered the Wuhan headquarters to act on his behalf, with He Chengjun presiding over the coordination. Recently, at the request of the people of the three provinces, he will arrive in Wuhan from Nanjing within a week to supervise the suppression of the bandits. After arriving in Wuhan, he will personally inspect the bandit areas in the Xiang and Gan provinces. On the 19th, He Chengjun telegraphed the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Chen Guangzu, to prepare everything, and said that many people would be following the Commander in Wuhan, so he should find a suitable residence. After receiving the order, Chen notified various institutions and groups to prepare for the welcome, and informed the municipal government to be responsible for finding a suitable residence. The municipal government is contacting the Salt Revenue Audit Office and the Bankers Association to determine a location within the two places. After receiving the news, the people of all circles also immediately established a preparatory welcome committee to handle everything. He Jian, Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, has been criticized by the Hunan people for losing two cities and has asked the National Government to resign from his positions. At the same time, there have been rumors in Xiang, E, and other places that He will be dismissed and punished, with Chen Mingshu, He Yaoshu, Xu Yuanquan, and Xia Douyin as possible successors. However, according to actual circumstances, these are mostly speculations, as the National Government still hopes that He will atone for his crimes. On the 19th, Liu Yinggu, Chief of Staff of the Fourth Route Headquarters, came to Wuhan from Nanjing and returned to Hunan that evening. According to reports, his visit to Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek was to report on the progress of the suppression of bandits in Hunan province and to ask for instructions on important matters, which was extremely successful. The rumors outside are not true. As for He's previous telegram to the Central Government and Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek requesting approval to resign from his positions, he has been ordered to be comforted and encouraged to be loyal to the party and the country and not to slack off. As for the shortage of military funds for the Fourth Route Army, Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek has promised considerable subsidies, and Hunan's post-disaster relief funds will also be fully supplied to comfort the people of Hunan, etc. (November 19)</p>
<h3>Lu Diping Enters Ji'an</h3>
<p>Ji'an, Jishui, and Yongfeng Counties All Recaptured A Nanchang correspondence reports that after the Luo and Gong divisions recaptured Ji'an on the 18th, the Mao Zedong and Peng Dehuai factions retreated to Donggu, the old lair in Xingguo, and the Zhu De faction in eastern Jiangxi also withdrew to Nanfeng and Shicheng. The bandits, except for the majority who converged in Ningdu and retreated, either returned to Jinggangshan or retreated to the border of Hunan, in a very embarrassing situation. Yesterday, the Provincial Government and the Ninth Route Army Headquarters also received a phone call from Commander Lu saying that the 18th Division had recaptured Yongfeng at 1:30 PM on the 19th, and the bandits fled from Shanan. The 24th Division also recaptured Jishui on the same day, completely destroying the bandit lair. The 50th Division's Yue Sen brigade also recovered Yihuang under Fuzhou on the same day, and the Cheng Guangyao brigade recovered Le'an. The New 13th Division defeated the bandits in Nancheng on the 17th and recaptured the county seat that evening, and the bandits fled to Nanfeng. The above divisions have successively seized more than 2,000 bandit guns and killed more than 3,000 bandits. The main force of the bandits has been eliminated and will no longer be able to do anything in the future. Commander Lu, with the successive recapture of counties along the Gan River, led all personnel of the Ninth Route Army Headquarters and guards to Ji'an by plane at 5:00 AM on the 20th in order to command nearby, inspect the disaster situation, and handle post-disaster relief. The following is Luo Lin's report on the recapture of Ji'an: I ordered the Yi brigade this morning to take the route to Xin'an Wangcheng Temple to attack the north gate of Ji'an, and personally led the remaining troops from Fu Avenue through Tongsutang to attack the southwest gate of Ji'an. The bandits have been repeatedly attacked by my troops in recent days and have been bombed by our air force, causing considerable casualties. They dared not love the battle and fled in different directions across the river to Donggu and Yonghe. Ji'an was recaptured at 3:00 PM today. It was found that the bandits were the two divisions of the false 20th Army and 22nd Army, and Mao Zedong was also in Ji'an commanding everything. Respectfully, Luo Lin.</p>
<h3>Liang Guanying's Troops Transfer to Jiangbei</h3>
<p>Departing from Guide, passing through Xudong and going down to Xuzhou A correspondence reports that after Liang Guanying surrendered to the Central Government, his troops, which were transferred from western Henan to Guide for concentration, were ordered to be transferred to Huaiyin, Lianshui, Huai'an, Siyang, Baoying, and Shuyang under the command of Zhang Zhijiang to be stationed for bandit suppression. Liang once went to Nanjing to pay homage to Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions on everything. Now, the railway has prepared two trains for round-trip transportation, and it is planned to depart from Guide, get off at the Grand Canal, and then go south along the Grand Canal to Qingjiangpu to be stationed in the Jiangbei area. Liang's 25th Route Army originally consisted of the First Division Zhao Dianxun, the Second Division Dai Huanzhou, the Third Division Zheng Tingren, and the Fourth Division Xie Guoshan, totaling about 30,000 people. Each time, two trains are used for transportation, which will take two weeks to complete. The first batch of troops being transported is the 280th Regiment of the 94th Brigade of the 32nd Division, Pan Taowan's troops, which passed through Xudong today (19th) at noon and went down to the east. The remaining troops are still waiting to be dispatched. It is reported that the general headquarters will be set up in Qingjiangpu, and Liang Guanying will move the headquarters there after the troops are transported. The troops were heavily guarded when they stopped in Xuzhou, but the uniforms have been distributed and are quite neat. (November 19)</p>
<h3>Jinan Suffers from a Shortage of Cash</h3>
<p>200,000 Yuan is Now Being Transported from Qingdao to Jinan to Regulate the Situation A Jinan correspondence reports that in recent days, the shortage of cash in the city has reached an extreme point. The discount per 1,000 yuan has risen from 1 yuan to 4 yuan or 6 yuan, breaking the previous record. Merchants and people from all walks of life are extremely distressed. It has been found that this matter is due to the fact that it is now late autumn and local products such as cotton, rice, and tobacco have begun to enter the market, all of which require cash to turn over. However, the total cash in the city is only 3 million yuan, which is of course insufficient to meet the demand. At the same time, 10,000 yuan is transported to other counties every day to purchase tobacco leaves, and 700,000 to 800,000 yuan has been transported to Dawenkou and Hebei Province to purchase cotton. The shortage of cash in the market was felt for a while. The long-term cause is due to Zhang Zongchang's three years of extortion in Shandong and the losses from the May 3rd Incident. Shandong was prosperous in commerce during the 15th and 16th years of the Republic, and there were more than a dozen banks such as the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, Banque Franco-Chinoise, Shanxi Provincial Bank, Donglai Bank, Industrial Bank, Zhonghua Bank, Mao Ye Bank, Daosheng Bank, and Tonghui Bank, issuing banknotes totaling 15 to 16 million yuan, which were fully redeemed, so there was sufficient cash. After Zhang Zongchang left, he took a total of 50 million yuan to Dalian. Shandong's finances had already declared bankruptcy, and then the May 3rd Incident destroyed the essence of the city. This year, it has been through wars for a long time and the political situation has changed repeatedly, resulting in the market being extremely tired. Currently, there are only five banks in the city: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and Central Bank. The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications issue banknotes totaling 2 million yuan, plus the Industrial Bank's banknotes, totaling only 5 million yuan. The Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank does not issue banknotes, and the Central Bank's banknotes are few in number. It can still be muddled through in peacetime, but it is very ineffective when local products are traded.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Bankers Association, fearing that the market would be disrupted due to the lack of cash, held a meeting to discuss relief methods. It was decided to ask the Central Bank to transport 200,000 yuan in silver from Qingdao to Jinan to regulate the situation. Representatives Qi Yixuan, Ai Xuexiao, and Xie Xinzai were elected to go to the Central Bank to negotiate. It is heard that the Central Bank has agreed to transport the silver on their behalf. Today, various banks have raised 200,000 yuan in remittances to Qingdao. The large batch of silver will arrive in Jinan in about a day or two. The following is the letter from the Bankers Association to the Central Bank: Respectfully, the current cash shortage in Jinan is extremely tight and the financial situation is extremely alarming. The reason is nothing more than the lack of silver. If active measures are not taken to maintain it, once an accident occurs, it will affect the market significantly. After the association convened a meeting of fellow guilds to discuss methods, it was agreed that maintaining the market requires raising silver, and the raising of silver must be handled by the National Bank. The consensus was to ask the bank to transport 200,000 yuan in silver from Qingdao to Jinan to regulate the situation. In addition to the public election of representatives to visit and present the case, we hereby send this letter in the hope that you will grant assistance. (November 19)</p>
<h3>Lu Xingbang Urges the Release of Lu Xingming Again</h3>
<p>The Fujian Provincial Government Asks He Chengjun to Mediate A Fuzhou correspondence reports that Lu Xingming was previously intercepted by He Yuan in Yanjian Shao Min Guo and detained by the Jiangshan Public Security Bureau before being transferred to the Zhejiang Provincial Government. The Fujian Provincial Government telegraphed Zhejiang for preferential treatment and sent Sun Benrong to Zhejiang to negotiate the release. Sun was waiting in Shanghai for Lin Zhiyuan to travel together, which delayed the date. Now Lu Xingbang has telegraphed the Provincial Government again, asking them to re-telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to release him immediately. In addition to urging Sun Benrong to go to Zhejiang immediately, the Provincial Government also telegraphed He Chengjun, asking him to telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to mediate.

<h3>Resolution of the Longjing Village Incident</h3>
<p>Both China and Japan have indicated their commitment to resolving the Sino-Japanese military police conflict in Longjing Village, Jilin. As reported previously, the situation shifted rapidly after the Japanese police withdrew on the 6th of this month. It is now learned that the original Japanese demands included: (1) 20,000 Japanese yen in compensation for each of the three Japanese policemen killed; (2) A formal apology from Chinese officials at the Japanese Consulate General; (3) Punishment of those responsible for the incident; (4) A guarantee that similar incidents would not occur in the future. After several rounds of negotiations between Zhang Shuhan, Director of the Yanji Municipal Preparatory Office, and Mr. Okada, the Japanese Consul General stationed in Longjing, their opinions gradually converged. On the 9th, Mr. Zhang, accompanied by Secretary Feng, went to Longjing again to continue negotiations with Mr. Okada. After deliberation, it was agreed that the Chinese side would provide 10,000 Japanese yen as a condolence payment, expressing regret for the deaths of the Japanese policemen. The Japanese side withdrew its demand for punishment, and the army personnel involved would be given appropriate punishment by the Chinese side on the grounds of misunderstanding. Consul General Okada would telegraph his government, and Mr. Zhang would telegraph the Jilin Provincial Government to request instructions. The Provincial Government has already replied, instructing him to proceed accordingly. Mr. Okada has also received instructions and personally visited Yanji on the 11th for a final meeting with Director Zhang. By the 13th, both parties had expressed their commitment to the above-mentioned arrangements, and the case was completely resolved. Only a small portion of the procedures remain. Furthermore, after the Japanese police withdrew, the Japanese consul informed the Chinese side that the local security would still be the responsibility of the Chinese side, which is considered a statement regarding the Japanese withdrawal of police.

<h3>Extensive Police Inspection of White Russians in Harbin</h3>
<p>Due to Protest from the Soviet Consul in Harbin. Harbin Communication: Mr. Melnikov, the Soviet Consul General in Harbin, lodged a protest with our Foreign Affairs Commissioner last week, stating that the Chinese authorities, according to the Borly Agreement, should not tolerate White Russians engaging in political activities and anti-Soviet movements in the Special Zone, or distributing leaflets that are detrimental to Soviet Russia. If the Chinese authorities do not crack down on these activities, it would be seen as deliberately inciting White Russians to take actions detrimental to Soviet Russia, and the Soviet Union will take appropriate measures to ensure the safety of important personnel in Harbin. At the same time, Znamensky, the Soviet Consul General in Liaoning, also protested to the local Jiaotong Department, listing the residences and activities of White Russian leaders. After receiving the protest letter forwarded by the Foreign Affairs Commissioner, the Northeast Political Affairs Committee telegraphed the Special Zone Administrator's Office, ordering a thorough inspection of the addresses provided to verify whether the allegations made by the Russian consul regarding the White Russians in Harbin were true. The Administrator's Office then instructed the Special Police Department to be responsible for the inspection. On the 14th of this month, the Investigation Bureau of the Special Police Department was ordered to handle this matter. The first inspection was conducted at No. 104 Dazhi Street, Qinjiagang. According to the Russian consul, the house was inhabited by former Russian generals (Baorge Lujiweisi Ji) and (Sichefu), who had formed an alliance of White Russian soldiers and secretly gathered loyal supporters as a powerful group to resist Soviet Russia. However, the Investigation Bureau found nothing during the inspection on that day. General Baorge Lujiweisi Ji had secretly arrived in Harbin from the Primorsky Krai last month and had recently gone to Shanghai. There was no political organization as claimed by the Russian consul. The residence of Sichefu at No. 7 Tongdao Street, Qinjiagang, was also inspected on the same day, but nothing was found. In the afternoon, inspections were also conducted at sixteen locations of the White Russian Youth Association and the Student Association, but no suspicious signs were found. On the 15th and 16th, inspections were continued in various places, but nothing was found. However, according to the list of suspicious individuals provided by the Russian consul: (1) Nazalov, of the National Corps of Russian Citizens Fighting Against the Third International, printed anti-Soviet documents at the Harbin Daily News Printing Company; (2) Sushkov, the leader of the former Russian Eagle Squad, lived at No. 13 Xiehe Street, Majiagou, and the important officials of the squad</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Bao Bao, lived at No. 20 Xinmaimai Street, at the Printing Office; (3) Glizov, the president of the Russian Truth Brotherhood, lived at No. 19 Fengtian Hotel, Nangang, and the printing of anti-Soviet documents was undertaken by the Fengtai Printing Office in Daoli; (4) Bokrovsky, the president of the National Assembly League, printed anti-Soviet documents at the Facai Printing Office at the corner of Central Avenue; (5) Mu Deli Ning, the commander of the Votkinsk Army Izhevites National Corps, currently lived on Majie Street; (6) Kuoluo Kuoli Ni Kuofu, the president of the Harbin Russian Refugee Relief Association, was located at No. 16 Youzheng Street, Nangang; (7) Grachev, the leader of the Farmers' and Workers' Corps, lived at No. 322 JieJing Street, Majiagou; (8) Longwei Li Yefu, the commander of the Ussuri Cavalry Army, was in contact with the Yingzi Army; (9) Leader Semyonov's movement group lived at No. 16 Jiaotang Street, Majiagou. The above are all the White Russian leaders whose activities the Soviet consul protested as the most important and demanded that they be suppressed. Therefore, in addition to the inspections that have already been carried out, the Special Police Department has also dispatched police to secretly monitor various locations. However, due to the Soviet consul's protest, the White Russians have become extremely indignant. In recent days, fights between Red and White Russians have occurred in various secluded streets at night, which is not uncommon. This is related to local security, so the authorities are being very cautious about the inspection. (16th)</p>
<h3>Jilin Chamber of Commerce Appeals to the Central Government to Revise the Chamber of Commerce Law</h3>
<p>Listing Three Reasons for the Amendment. Shenyang Communication: The Jilin Provincial Chamber of Commerce recently sent a telegram to Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, appealing to him to propose to the central government amendments to the implementing regulations of the Chamber of Commerce Law to safeguard commercial operations. The telegram reads as follows: (We have found that since the promulgation of the newly enacted Chamber of Commerce Law and its implementing regulations, the commercial sector across the country has collectively opposed them unanimously. Regarding the new law, the points that various General Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Commerce find difficult to accept can be summarized as follows: (1) The new law stipulates that the number of executive committee members of the Chamber of Commerce is only fifteen, which is too small. The number of personnel should be increased. It is also found that in large commercial ports, there are many guilds and industries. The executive committee is the crystallization of the consensus of merchants, and the number of members must be slightly broader to avoid industries feeling left out during elections. The new law only stipulates fifteen executive committee members, which cannot represent the interests of the entire commercial sector, and the drawbacks will inevitably lead to difficulties in handling affairs and repeated failures. It is urgent to revise this in accordance with the organizational outline approved by the provincial chambers of commerce, setting the number of members of the General Chamber of Commerce at forty-nine and the number of members of the Chamber of Commerce at twenty-five. This is the first amendment that should be made. (2) The name of the General Chamber of Commerce should be preserved, and the format of official documents should remain unchanged. The establishment of the General Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce is based on the complexity of commerce and the size of the commercial port. The establishment of the General Chamber of Commerce is in a province or a large port. Its geographic location is important, and its commerce is prosperous. Therefore, the word "General" is added to the name to show its importance. The power of jurisdiction belongs to the highest local administrative official, so that they can make convenient petitions and avoid delays and difficulties. This was carefully considered when the law was originally drafted and has been implemented for many years without any problems. The current Chamber of Commerce Law not only eliminates the name of the General Chamber of Commerce, but also stipulates that the procedures for official documents must be submitted to the local county and municipal governments for review and transfer, reducing the scope of the Chamber of Commerce and reducing the powers of the Chamber of Commerce, which is clearly inconsistent with democratic centralism. This is the second amendment that should be made. (3) The official seal of the General Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce should remain in its original form and not be changed. Since the names of the General Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce are different, the trust and respect should not be the same. Furthermore, it has been implemented for many years, and officials and merchants have been at peace. This is essentially a matter of form and has nothing to do with the overall situation. Why should it be changed? It is necessary to order that they all be changed to use the seal, which is nothing more than depriving the Chamber of Commerce of its power. This kind of proposition seems unreasonable. This is the third amendment that should be made. In summary, the Chamber of Commerce is a legal organization of merchants, originally established to seek commercial development and enhance the welfare of the commercial sector. In recent years, during the rise of the revolutionary army, raising funds and soliciting debts, the commercial sector across the country has spared no effort to support the revolution. It has made considerable achievements in the history of the revolution. Now, fortunately, the revolution has been completed. Although we dare not ask for rewards, the status and treatment of the General Chamber of Commerce and the Chamber of Commerce should not be maintained as before. Furthermore, we must be subject to various constraints and restrictions. The matter is unfair and painful to speak of. Although the chambers of commerce in various provinces and regions have repeatedly petitioned the central government, there have been no results. Now, fortunately, the overall situation has been settled. It is a time for the people of the whole country to work hard on construction. The Chamber of Commerce is a legal organization without an appropriate legal system. We have always admired your seat for protecting merchants and upholding justice. Therefore, we appeal to you with all our heart to approve the proposal to the central government to revise the Chamber of Commerce Law and its implementing regulations to safeguard commercial operations and comfort public opinion. We are awaiting orders with utmost urgency. (November 18th)</p>
<h3>Disputes in the Shandong Hat-Making Industry</h3>
<p>German Merchants Fail to Fulfill Contract, Labor Decides to Protest. Qingdao Communication: The Baohe Foreign Firm Juji Accounting House, a German merchant in Qingdao, established a model factory for women's hat weaving in Jiaoxian County this spring, recruiting more than 30 female students. After graduation, factories were established in Jiaoxian, Jimo, Pingdu, Gaomi, and other counties, with one general contractor for each factory. A contract was signed with the most important condition being that all raw materials would be supplied by the capital side, and after production, they would still be sold to foreigners. The teachers would also be dispatched by the capital side. Within two years, the contractors of the factories could not resell the goods produced by the factories to other merchants. Furthermore, all costs related to teaching fees, practice grass weaving materials, etc., and hat weaving wages would be provided by the accounting house. Within a few months of opening, the number of expanded factories reached more than 13 counties, with about hundreds of factories and more than 10,000 workers. These workers were purely women, and those with excellent skills could make two to three grass hats per month (this type of hat is made of flax fabric and is meticulously handmade), while those with ordinary skills could make one to two hats. The wages per hat were about four or five yuan, and each person could earn more than ten yuan per month. Unexpectedly, the foreign firm's accounting house has recently violated the contract. Initially, the teaching fees were changed to be borne by the contractors, and then the practice grass and all other costs were also changed to be borne by the contractors. At that time, the contractors of each factory had a large amount of money advanced for labor costs, and they could not afford to stop, so they had to endure the pain silently. Later, the accounting house refused to provide workers with materials and only accepted grass hats without paying wages, resulting in each factory having losses of up to five or six million yuan. At that time, more than 10,000 female workers were also unemployed. Recently, the accounting house has gathered the contractors of each factory to a meeting at the accounting house, ordering them to hand over all the materials issued before, whether completed or not, and to dismiss them all uniformly, otherwise, they would be severely punished. The contractors of each factory have united and protested against the Juji Accounting House's violation of regulations and destruction of labor, which is unbearable, and they have requested assistance from all walks of life.

<h3>Jiangsu Province Business Tax Collection Registration Fee Issue</h3>
<p>Wuxi Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Central Government to Request Instructions for Clarification, and Asked to Suspend Collection Before Receiving a Reply. Wuxi Communication: Jiangsu Province is launching a business tax collection registration fee, and the provincial government has appointed Zhu Shengwu as the director of the Wuxi collection, implementing the collection. The Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce has repeatedly received requests from various related industries and specially convened a meeting of representatives of various industries at 4 pm yesterday to discuss and resolve the issue. After deliberation, it was deemed that there were issues that should be resolved first, and the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce was telegraphed to take the lead in submitting a request to the central government for clarification, and before receiving a reply from the central government, the provincial government was requested to temporarily suspend the collection of business tax collection registration fees. After the meeting, the Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram on behalf of the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce that night, the original text is as follows: (The Fourth National Industry and Commerce Conference on November 5th, according to Article 8 of the Ministry of Finance's Outline of Methods for Collecting Business Tax in Various Provinces, stipulated that the collection of business tax must be carried out after the abolition of Likin is implemented. It was resolved that Jiangsu Province's plan to prepare for the collection of business tax registration fees does not comply with the Outline set by the Ministry. It is proposed that it is not necessary to formulate other transitional measures within the shortest period of time for the abolition of Likin, such as the Jiangsu Province's plan to prepare for the collection of business tax registration fees. Furthermore, the Sixth Item of Clause C of the plan to rejuvenate politics and establish the center of governance in the shortest period of time, which was resolved by the Fourth Plenary Session on November 17th, also stipulated that Likin and traffic surcharges similar to Likin will be abolished on January 1, 1931. The provinces must not request an extension for any reason. Furthermore, Clause 5 of the declaration resolved on November 18th also decided to abolish the Likin system on January 1, 1931, in order to reduce the burden on the people, eliminate the malpractices of decades, and promote the revitalization of industry and commerce. This is the sincerity of the central government and an important decision of this meeting. With the abolition of Likin having a fixed date, business tax is bound to be implemented, and there is no need to have another transition and collect registration fees. It is true that after the abolition of Likin, as stated in the original proposal resolved by the Industry and Commerce Conference, business tax can be conducted openly and fairly according to the provisions of the Outline, and it is not necessary to take advantage of the opportunity to add additional burdens to merchants and people in this short period of time. However, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance has submitted the Regulations on the Preparation for the Collection of Business Tax Registration Fees in Jiangsu Province and its Implementing Rules to the provincial government meeting for approval and promulgation, and ordered the counties to start operating as soon as possible. Upon investigation, Article 1, Section 2 of the Outline set by the Ministry stipulates that business licenses are renewed annually without charging a license fee. The Jiangsu Province's plan to prepare for the collection of business tax registration fees already contradicts the Outline set by the Ministry, and Article 2 of its regulations stipulates that those who have already obtained a registration certificate will be issued a magnetic tablet for a fee of 20 cents, and Article 10 stipulates that whether a business registration certificate is newly obtained or renewed, a fee of 20 cents will be charged for each certificate. In addition to the registration fee, there is also a magnetic tablet fee and a registration certificate fee, which further violates the new Outline. Not to mention that the Jiang Chamber of Commerce previously telegraphed, based on Article 2, Section 2 of the Outline set by the Ministry, which stipulates that the types and conditions of business and the special circumstances in each province may be proposed separately, with variable methods and tax standards reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation, but the tax rate levied may not be higher than the provisions of this Outline. It was repeatedly stated that the Outline set by the Ministry should be used as the basis and six matters should be taken into consideration. It should be invited to public opinion. Upon investigation, Article 1 of the Outline set by the Ministry stipulates that business tax is local revenue, and all those who engage in commerce and open shops within the territory of each province, except for companies registered by the central government and those who have already had special taxes collected by the central government, must apply for a business license and pay business tax. Companies registered by the central government and those who have already had special taxes collected by the central government should be excluded from the scope of taxation. This is one point. Furthermore, Article 2 stipulates that the businesses subject to taxation include the sale of goods, manufacturing, printing, hotels, inns, entertainment venues, photography, dentistry, contracting, leasing of goods, transportation, money shops, pawnshops, and warehouses, which are listed clearly. Those that are not listed are naturally not subject to taxation. This is the second point. Furthermore, Article 4 stipulates that the following types are not subject to business tax: (1) those with capital less than 500 yuan, (2) those with annual income less than 1,000 yuan, (3) those without shop names, and (4) firewood industry. The above types, even if they are listed in Article 2, are not subject to business tax. This is the third point. Furthermore, Article 7 stipulates that after the implementation of business tax, all existing tooth sticker taxes, donation sticker taxes, slaughter taxes, etc., and other donations and taxes of the same nature as business tax in each province shall be separately merged or abolished. After the implementation of business tax, all existing tooth sticker taxes, donation sticker taxes, and slaughter taxes shall be merged or abolished. This is the fourth point. Furthermore, business tax is local revenue according to Article 1 of the Outline set by the Ministry, and there are currently four levels of provinces, counties, districts, towns, and townships. If it is over-emphasized at the provincial level, it will cause local disputes. How should it be divided or properly allocated? It seems that the Ministry should determine this in advance to avoid future disputes between local areas and the repeated burdens on merchants and people. This is the fifth point. Furthermore, Article 9 of the Outline set by the Ministry stipulates that the implementing rules for the collection of business tax shall be formulated by each province based on the provisions of this Outline and reported to the Ministry for record. The special circumstances in each province may propose separate variable methods and tax standards, which are all summarized within the scope of the implementing rules and must not formulate regulations that conflict with the Outline set by the Ministry. This is very clear. The current Jiangsu Province's Regulations on Business Tax Registration Fees not only fundamentally conflict with the Outline set by the Ministry, but also Article 2 separately collects magnetic license fees, Article 3 increases the registration fee for imported goods, Article 10 separately collects registration fees, and Article 11 imposes a penalty of two times the amount that should be supplemented for those who do not record their business or conceal short reports. These all do not comply with the Outline set by the Ministry. This is the sixth point. Furthermore, Article 3 of the Jiangsu Province's Regulations on Business Tax Registration Fees stipulates that businesses that mainly engage in imported goods will be singled out and have their capital amount increased by 5 per mille. This seems to be aimed at resisting foreign goods. However, upon careful examination of Article 2 of the Outline set by the Ministry, which lists the various businesses subject to taxation, there is no special provision for imported goods. This is not because it does not know the intention of resisting foreign goods, but because imported goods should be taxed by the customs according to the weight of the goods, and the business tax is based on the operation of commerce and opening of shops according to Article 1 of the Outline set by the Ministry.</p>

<p>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</p>
<p>Without Non-Adding Further, While Most Inland Shops Agree That It Would Be Difficult To Distinguish Between Domestic And Foreign Goods; This Is The Seventh Point. Specially Gathered Representatives From Various Industries At The Accounting For Discussion And Resolution On The 20th Of This Month, And All Agreed That Since The Fourth Plenary Session Has Already Resolved To Implement Likin As Of January 1, 1931, And Treat It As An Important Decision, It Should Be Based On The Resolution Of The Industry And Commerce Conference, Without The Need For A Transition To Collect Registration Fees. After The Implementation Of Likin, The Business Tax Will Inevitably Be Implemented, And We Should Continue To Actively Prepare Or, By Merchants, Begin By Investigating Matters Separately According To The Provisions Of Article 1 Of The Outline Set By The Ministry To Show Merchants And People's Honesty In The Central Government's Decision To Abolish Likin. However, If The Aforementioned Key Points Are Not Resolved First, The Methods Of The Ministry And The Province Will Inevitably Cause Significant Obstacles. The Government Advocates The Intention Of Uniting The Entire Country And Uses A Special Telegram To Request Your Association To Again Take The Lead In Requesting That The Central Government Clarify Its Explanation And Forward It To The Provincial Government Before A Reply Is Received From The Central Government. The Jiangsu Province Should Temporarily Suspend The Implementation Of All Business Tax Collection And Registration Fees In Order To Comply With The Central Government's Resolutions And Avoid The Ambiguity Of The Ministry And Province. The Jiangsu Province Is Overwhelmed With Anxiety. Wuxi County Chamber Of Commerce Respectfully.</p>

<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Shaxi Tian Stores Robbed: At Shaxi Tian, about ten miles outside the north gate of this city, there are more than twenty stores, large and small. Unexpectedly, at about 2 a.m. yesterday, a dozen or so robbers, their faces covered with cloth, each holding guns, iron bars, and electric torches, and speaking in mixed dialects, suddenly arrived at the village. They robbed stores in different directions. The robbed businesses included Che Tongxing, Futai, and Tongchang grain and general merchandise stores, suffering a total loss of over four hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Refugees Disturb Beishi Village: In Yuanjia Hui in Huzhou, a large number of refugees, three to four hundred, from Jianshi, Shuanglin, and other places arrived. The Public Security Bureau's Patrol Chief Shen and Sergeant Li temporarily detained them in Beishi Village. Unexpectedly, that place is an isolated hillock surrounded by water with no land route. The refugees then scattered to the villagers' homes, taking the name of collecting firewood and drinking tea, and arbitrarily seizing clothing and money. Dozens of families in the village were spared no losses, with the wealthiest Wang Xinfu family suffering the greatest loss. Afterwards, the village committee reported to the Yuanjia Hui water police and telegraphed the county government in this city for instructions. Ultimately, because the number of refugees was too large, there was no way to investigate. Only a dozen or so boats were hired to escort them to the Qingshan area and released them on the highway.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Preface to the Recompiled Catalog of the Tianyige Collection</h3>
<p>Several months ago, my friend Yang Ziyi took office as the mayor of Ningbo. I repeatedly wrote to him, urging him to reorganize the books in the Tianyige collection and compile a new catalog, holding the Fan clan jointly responsible for its preservation. Ziyi followed my advice. The account given by his secretary, Mr. Yang, is quite detailed. It is clear that the essence of the Tianyige collection has been almost completely lost, and even a single paper rubbing of bronzes and stone inscriptions remains. It is truly lamentable. The treasures of the world that have disappeared from the Tianyige collection are certainly not limited to the Huashan and Liu Xiong steles. The Tianyige of Xia'an was the place where Fan Shilang Yaoqing of the Ming dynasty stored his books. Siming's collection of books was led by Feng of Chengxi. Feng was a descendant of the Song dynasty's Qingmin Duke. His family had the Ten Thousand Volumes Tower, which contained many famous Song and Yuan dynasty xylographs. After several generations, about seventeen or eight out of ten were lost due to burning, destruction, borrowing, and theft. When they were gathered and returned to the Tianyige, they were specifically left behind by his son. Shilang obtained them and borrowed and copied what Yan Zhou had collected to supplement them. Moreover, he always personally wrote down the dates he obtained them. Therefore, the printed editions of the books are all from before the Tianqi era, and the manuscript copies are also not items that circulated in the market. As for those that included early Qing dynasty versions, they were added by his descendants and not touched by Shilang's hand. Therefore, although there were several book collections at the time, the Fan family was particularly known for its ancient books. Shilang divided his property and estimated the value of the books at ten thousand taels of silver, all to be inherited by one son. It cannot be said that his handling of the books was not good. After another generation, the locks and keys were very strict. Family rules stipulated that descendants could not go upstairs unless all branches of the family agreed, and they were not allowed to take books off the steps or privately lead relatives and friends to tour the blessed land. The strictness of the gate was equal to that of the imperial archives. Therefore, for decades between the Ming and Qing dynasties, spiderwebs and dust sealed off the floor, and it was nearly devoid of human traces, only arousing scholars' envy and speculative efforts. During the Qianlong era, an imperial edict was issued to seek out surviving books throughout the empire for the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library of the Four Treasuries). His descendant, Maozhu, selected 622 books to present to the emperor, who rewarded him with the Complete Illustrations and Commentary on the Book of History and the Illustrated Account of Military Achievements in the Pacification of the Hui Regions. He also personally inscribed the Wei Liaoweng's Zhouyi Yaoyi and Ma Zong's Yibei, which were among the books he presented, to show his favor and returned the remaining books he presented. He ordered weaving officials to personally visit his home to examine the methods of book collection, deeming it a model for the Tianlu Library. However, the catalog of the books remained unknown to outsiders. Initially, Mr. Huang Lizhou, due to his great prestige and friendship, was allowed to visit the pavilion as an exception and selected the most ancient and obscure books to copy into a catalog, which was circulated among people in Kunshan Jie Lu, so people began to know that there was a catalog of books in Tianyige, while the catalog of inscriptions was seen in Mr. Qian Xinbo's Yin Zhi. During the Jiaqing era, when Ruan Wenda governed Zhejiang, he began to engrave the catalog and write a preface to it. Since then, the Tianyige book catalog began to be published to the world. The catalog contained 4,094 books, 53,799 volumes. The catalog of inscriptions contained 764 kinds, which was also a grand sight. Since then, it suffered misfortune. During the Taiping Rebellion, Ningbo was a battlefield. Tian Wu Zhui Ku Lunyu Daixin was the first calamity. The founding of the Republic of China also suffered from its effects. Those who carried them away in bundles often fell into the hands of the Jiangbei Christian Church. After negotiation, they were allowed to be redeemed, but they were no longer perfect. This was the second calamity. The pavilion was sealed off, and those in charge regarded it as supremely sacred. However, the wall climbers took advantage of its uninhabited state. Once they managed to climb over the wall and break the window, they could calmly advance and retreat. This was the third calamity. Moreover, since people loved ancient artifacts, cases of digging up homes became increasingly common, and the techniques of stealing books became increasingly clever. Hidden paths were shifted and transformed invisibly. Looking at the Dade Changguo Zhou Zhi, Xue's catalog still noted manuscript copies, but the existing ones were replaced by new carved editions by Xu of Siming. Where did the manuscript copies go, and where did the carved editions come from? If not replaced, what else? Moreover, upon inspection, there was clearly a hidden cover in the floorboards, an empty space large enough for one person to go up and down. This was the fourth calamity. The decline continued until the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras, when Xue Guan'cha engraved the catalog, but the ancient carvings that remained in the catalog were as sparse as the morning stars. It was estimated that the book catalog still had 2,056 titles, with complete notes for 1,270 titles. As for now, after several decades, the intentional and secret replacements must be ten times more than in the past. In the autumn of the Gengwu year, Mayor Yang Ziyi of the Municipal Government had the profound intention of preservation and ordered Tie Fu, Zhe Xian, Qifeng, and Yuting to investigate and prepare a catalog. Tie Fu and others, against the Fan clan's wishes, completed the task in one day. Although the time was pressing, they had a general understanding. Comparing it with the catalog written by the Fan clan in their own cleanup, it should not be too far off. The total was 936 titles, totaling 8,871 volumes, about half of Xue's catalog. Among them, there were still 250 or 60 that were intact, but most belonged to one or two volumes, about one-fifth of Xue's catalog. However, there were more than 200 titles that were not in Xue's catalog. Most of the complete ones belonged to this category. Is it because old things are easily scattered and new things are easily preserved? As the number of volumes increased, the fewer that remained. Therefore, the number of titles seems impressive, but the number of volumes is actually quite small. Among them, the most complete is the geography category, with more than 95% preserved. It is unknown whether geography is different from other books. Other books should be ancient, but geography should be modern. Ming dynasty local chronicles can be used to study the past but are insufficient for examining the present. Because they are unsuitable for the times, their completeness is fitting. In addition, no stone inscriptions or rubbings remain. More than ten pieces of stone carvings are still safe and sound. There are books that originally had dozens of volumes, but only one or two volumes remain. In addition, the Complete Illustrations and Commentary on the Book of History still has 4,074 volumes, about half of the original book. The Sancai Guangzhi, a kind of leishu (encyclopedia) similar to the Yuanjian Leihan, was annotated by Ruan with 1,184 juan and 237 volumes. By the time of Xue's catalog, 132 volumes still remained, but now only 42 volumes remain. It is likely that someone is gradually plotting to seize this book. It is heard that this time, during the arrest of thieves, someone confessed to being hired to steal this book. In the future, the situation will not reach the point of complete loss. Only then will we know that the stricter the sealing, the more covetous the crowd, and the more covetous the crowd, the faster the loss. Qin destroyed weapons to stop the chaos, but Chen She rose up and Xianyang was burned. Russia implemented autocracy to prevent change, but the revolutionary party rose up and the throne was lost. The principle is the same. The person who collects books reads them himself and has his children and grandchildren read them. Self-reading is only a few decades. Accumulating wealth for descendants and not being able to guard even this little bit, what is the point of strictly confining and deep locking? Even if the descendants want to see it, they cannot, let alone peruse it by hand and recite it. There is nothing worse than suppressing the nature of books and losing the use of books. For the Fan family, the best strategy is to allocate funds to have their ancestors reorganize the incomplete parts and supplement them completely, establish a special person to manage them, and make them available to local people, calling it the Shilang Library to popularize Shilang's virtue and perpetuate Shilang's spirit. If they estimate that they cannot achieve this, then they should transport them to the public sector and have the public bear the responsibility for reorganization and preservation. Those descendants who can read can still visit and study from time to time to share and assimilate the virtue and spirit of their ancestor. If they cannot read at the moment, they can wait until their descendants can redeem them. Public management is certainly more sustainable than private management; this is the middle strategy. First, transfer the Sancai Guangzhi, which outsiders want to steal, to lithographic printing to spread it widely, which can greatly benefit scholars and, on a smaller scale, subtly eliminate spying. This is the lower strategy. If they still insist on sealing as a policy and secrecy as a doctrine, it is either tempting bookworms or preparing rations for thieves, which is a no-strategy. If Shilang knew, he would agree with me. In the year of the Republic of China, November 6, Yang Tielu of Zhongshan wrote this preface in the Tongyin Kan Shu Room of Zhongshan Park.</p>
<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>The United States Will Change Its Educational Policy</h3>
<p>Students' Graduation Determined by Ability, Not by Academic Year or Credits: The National News Agency, Chicago, 20th – The president of the University of Chicago announced today that they intend to drastically change their educational policy. Students' graduation will not be based on academic year or credits but on individual ability. Regardless of grade level, if a student can achieve university graduation results in a large subject, they will be granted a diploma. The university's president, Hutchins, told people that most students can complete their university education in two years, and there should be many who can succeed in one year. For students who already have considerable self-study, graduation in half a semester may not be impossible. The old-style academic system is too rigid and requires a change in policy to be more flexible, he said.</p>
<h3>The Mingzhi University Dispute Intensifies</h3>

The facilities include a library and a spacious sports field. The auditorium and classrooms are newly built, and the school building is quite suitable. The attached normal school has two grades and has graduated twice. Recently, due to the prolonged vacancy of the principal's position, the county government's education bureau has sent personnel to maintain it.

<p>(4) Social Education: Social education in Huai'an has made considerable progress in recent years. The county-run public education center is divided into five departments: general affairs, library, editing, promotion, and science. Each department has a director, and the attached public literacy school is quite impressive. The school offers two types of programs: general and specialized. The general program is further divided into basic and advanced levels. The specialized program is divided into three courses: crafts, home economics, and business common sense. The curriculum content caters to the needs of society and the psychology of learners. Therefore, students at all levels can advance and retreat on time, with great interest. Women's class students, from noble ladies to maids, gladly mingle. There are currently 236 female students and 96 male students in the basic level, advanced level, crafts, home economics, and business common sense classes. (Last year, eight classes graduated once, with 173 female students and 26 male students.) Classes are held from 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. and from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. daily. Each grade has two hours of classes per day. The academic performance of the students is acceptable, which is truly a rare achievement in recent years. Director Yao Renshou is enthusiastic about research, which has led to this kind of good result. The branch centers have reading rooms and lecture rooms. The experimental public school has one principal and nine faculty members, with monthly expenses of 220 yuan. There are currently six classes with 160 students.

<p>E. Y. Hsu and Liu Zhanen Are Also Members: The Ta Mei Wan Bao reported that the Education Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to set up another subcommittee to specifically discuss important issues related to education and report to the committee.

<h3>Tongwen School Strike Expands</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Departments Join Strike: The Tongwen School in Shanghai's West End recently provoked a strike by Chinese students due to unreasonable oppression by the school, which has lasted for more than four days. The school authorities have not yet responded. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the student union convened an emergency general meeting to decide on various countermeasures, and more than ten representatives from other schools gave speeches of condolence and firm support. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. They swore that they would not resume classes until they had won. The Japanese students had previously protested the dismissal of Guo and Wang, arguing that the reasons were inadequate and the procedures were improper. There had been no adequate response to the issue of 33 yuan in county expenses being economically opaque, as well as the issues of depriving them of freedom of speech and publication and banning the Jiangnan Xuebao (Japanese newspaper). Therefore, they held a general meeting the night before and resolved to sincerely unite with the Chinese students and join the strike.</p>
<h3>Supervisor of Students in Japan, Liu Suichang, Departs for Japan</h3>
<p>Leaves Tomorrow on the Asama Maru: The newly appointed Supervisor of Students in Japan, Liu Suichang, returned to Shanghai from Beijing. The reporter immediately drove to his private residence on Dongpu Stone Road to inquire about the departure date and conduct the following conversation: Reporter: When will you depart? Mr. Liu: After being appointed by the Ministry of Education, I originally intended to depart as soon as possible, but because all the procedures had not yet been completed, I had to wait to receive the mandate from the National Government. Therefore, I decided to take the Asama Maru to Japan tomorrow (23rd). Reporter: There are many disputes in the student affairs in Japan, and successive supervisors have felt the difficulty. I wonder what countermeasures you have in mind in the future? Mr. Liu: I studied in Japan for eight years. After returning to China, I went to Japan several times to investigate. I know the situation there very well. Every dispute that arises cannot be blamed solely on the students' fondness for causing trouble. The other parties must also bear considerable responsibility. If we can be fair and impartial, respect the law, seek convenience for students, and take care of the face of the country, and treat each other with sincerity in everything, disputes can be reduced. I have always felt that this is the purpose of doing things, asking only for cultivation and not for harvest. Revolutionaries should especially ask only what should be done, regardless of how difficult the future is. I sincerely hope to do this in the future, even if the results are not good, I will have a clear conscience. Reporter: Are there any other personnel accompanying you on this trip? Mr. Liu: In addition to inviting Comrade Zhuang Yuling to go to serve as the director of general affairs, I plan to decide on the other personnel after arriving in Japan. If the performance of the old staff is still good, I am unwilling to make too many changes, he said.</p>

<h3>Mr. Zhang Zuoren's Recent New Discovery</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zuoren, former professor of biology at China Public School and Great China University, is studying the inheritance of protozoa at the Tao Lai Lusso Zoological Institute JUSLILUDZOOLOGIGUEJORLRLERRROUSSEAU. The college has also prepared a laboratory for Mr. Zhang Zuoren's personal use, with extremely complete content equipment. It is said that when Mr. Zhang was cultivating a certain trichomonad PARAMAE OIUMCAUDANIUM, he suddenly discovered an extraordinary form of the trichomonad, whose form was very different from the common ones, and its method of reproduction was quite similar to budding reproduction, which was also very different from common fission reproduction. This is enough to clarify the evolution of the methods of biological reproduction and its fundamental principles. Mr. Zhang once made a report on the results of the experiment in June, which caused a deep interest in the royal zoology of Belgium and was of great interest to the experts attending the meeting.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Basketball Tournament</h3>
<p>Last night's three-game results: Group B, Evening Star defeated Tax School 25-15; Group A, Zhonggong defeated St. John's 27-19; Group A, Zhenru defeated Myles 37-27.</p>
<p>Tonight's four games: In last night's Xiqing Basketball Tournament, there were three games. Among them, Zhonggong's victory over St. John's was unexpected. The skills of the other two teams in the four-team game were slightly different, so the results could be predicted beforehand. Tonight's four games feature teams of equal strength, making it difficult to predict the outcome.</p>
<h3>(1) Evening Star defeated Tax School (Group B)</h3>
<p>The Tax School's talent is far from what it used to be. None of last year's talents remain. Yesterday's performance was still lacking in skill, which is due to a lack of training. The Evening Star team, organized by Tongji Middle School, played with a good structure. Their shooting skills were quite strong. Initially, Evening Star tried twice to penetrate the enemy's basket but failed. Three advances by Li Silin and Luo Guangkai succeeded one after another. As a result of Tax School's counterattack, Cheng Kegong and Chen Shaowang each scored one shot, resulting in a score difference of 3-4. Evening Star's formation suddenly changed, and they scored three consecutive goals in a flash. Tax School knew that a desperate fight would not be enough to save the situation. As luck would have it, they relied on Cheng Kegong's strength to reduce the difference to 10-11, which was the result of the first half. In the second half, Tax School launched a concerted effort and took the lead. Within three minutes, Evening Star rose again, and from then on, they were safe and unhindered. As a result of their previous lead, Evening Star won 25-15. Referee Pei Lisi.</p>
<p>Evening Star Team	Tax School Team	Position and Name	Fouls	Points	Position and Name	Fouls	Points	Right Forward	Luo Guangkai	Once	12	Right Forward	Wu Jihan	Once	0	Left Forward	Wang Jilu	Twice	7	Left Forward	Chen Shaowang	0	7	Center	Li Minglin	0	6	Center	Cheng Kegong	0	8	Right Guard	Ji Yubiao	Twice	0	Right Guard	Zhang Guanghua	Once	0	Left Guard	Shu Changmei	Thrice	0	Left Guard	Li Chuanzhu	0	0	Left Guard	Hu Zhaoying	0	0	Total	Twice	15	Total	Eight Times	25	Second Half: Evening Star 10 points, Tax School 9 points. Second Half: Evening Star 15 points, Tax School 6 points.</p>
<h3>(2) Zhonggong defeated St. John's (Group A)</h3>
<p>Zhonggong's victory over St. John's was a big surprise. Zhonggong's strength was indeed stronger in last night's battle. At the start of the fierce battle, Zhonggong came on fiercely and developed to the fullest. St. John's, suffering this blow, was restrained, spending most of the time being attacked. Besides Lin Zequn's penalty shot for one point, no one else was able to score. Zhonggong's inner guard, Liao Lie, opened the scoring. Before long, Wei Zuohan and Liao Lie scored again, making it a difference of 6-1. St. John's, trapped in confusion, took a break to plan. At one point, the atmosphere was filled with war. St. John's Hou Xuemin showed his skills and scored two goals, and the battle became more intense. Zhonggong's Liao Lie was lively, both offensively and defensively. At that time, he was accidentally injured by his teammate Chen Baoqiu, but he still fought bravely, greatly boosting the morale of the entire army. Liao He scored from both near and far. St. John's was only able to score points through Hou's accurate throws, so he scored five consecutive points. The score gradually approached. In the first half, Zhonggong 12, St. John's 10. In the second half, St. John's came on and made several shots, which seemed to herald a sign of not giving up. But Zhonggong's He Liao was able to score at will. In general, Zhonggong's momentum of progress was unstoppable, but their throwing skills were lacking. Otherwise, the number of points they won would have been more impressive. St. John's remained in a subordinate position and had no special improvement. The performance in the second half was particularly inferior. As a result, Zhonggong defeated St. John's 27-19. Referee Luo Xunshi.</p>

Second Half: Zhonggong 15 points, St. John's 9 points.</p>
<h3>(3) Zhenru defeated Myles (Group A)</h3>
<p>Zhenru was strong both inside and out. Although Myles was strong, they had to be content with being inferior. In the first five minutes, the two teams fought fiercely and failed to score any points. Cai Rongrui first scored. Myles also respectfully returned a goal. Thereafter, both sides had their gains, and the difference was very small. Only Zhenru was ahead and Myles followed behind. After it reached 10-6, Zhenru became even more brilliant, and the score continued to increase. Myles's generals were repeatedly replaced, but there was no improvement. The distance once reached 18-6, which became the result of the first half. In the second half, Myles cheered up and improved. Zhenru showed their skills and confronted a strong enemy. The largest distance was 30-14 and 35-19. Only in the last five minutes did Myles achieve a lot. Fortunately, Zhenru was conservative and still had the advantage. As a result, Zhenru won 37-32. Referee Blotuo.</p>

<h3>Registration for the All-Shanghai Women's Basketball Tournament Closes Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>The momentum of basketball in Shanghai has been high recently. Yun and Jian are also very excited. However, it is purely a contest for men, and women's competitions have been silent. Therefore, the National Sports Association, in view of this, has launched the Third All-Shanghai Women's Basketball Championship as an example. It has already started this month (the 17th). Members have been informed early and have prepared to compete for the championship starting on the 26th. In the dimly lit women's sports scene in our country, after returning from the Far Eastern Games, it is as if they have woken up from a sleep. The school authorities have worked hard and trained hard for several months. This interesting competition, where Chinese and Western women gather, will definitely attract enthusiastic participation. Victory is honorable, and defeat is not an obstacle. Learning from others' skills will be helpful. The registration period is limited to tomorrow night, and we will wait and see the grand occasion of the championship.</p>

<h3>A Word of Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Lanxi</p>
<p>People who walk in the thorns are not often hurt by the thorns because they know what position they are in and know to be careful.</p>
<p>Life is blind, love is blind, and all human actions are blind. The only difference is whether their state of mind is clear.</p>
<p>If we admit that life is just a big dream, then what kind of dream is this that makes our hearts tremble?</p>
<p>You should know what to hate before you know what to love. Although love and hate are contradictory, they are quite related. The deeper the love, the shallower the hate. The deeper the hate, the shallower the love.</p>
<p>There is an invisible market in love. It is almost like a trade, but it cannot be heavily discounted. You should feel extremely painful when love is discounted. True love cannot be bought with money; you must exchange it for your true feelings.</p>
<p>In the process of life, it is like walking on a rough and uneven road. Some people carefully pass through this dangerous situation, and some people fall into the dark abyss unconsciously.</p>
<p>Love can make you excited when you are tired, and it can also discourage active people. Fine wine cannot intoxicate people, it only makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. But love can intoxicate your entire life.</p>
<p>Many young men and women have many tragedies because of misunderstandings about love. What love gives them is not pain, but a good lesson.</p>
<p>The love that the Creator gives us is limited. Before you get the person you truly admire and love, you must not abuse your love, because when love is used up, troubles will follow closely behind you.</p>
<h3>A Record of Wu Changshuo's Tomb Construction in Chaoshan</h3>
<p>— Lian Weng</p>
<p>Chaoshan is the main mountain of Tangqi Town in Hangzhou, with a circumference of more than 20 li. It is planted with plum blossoms and no other miscellaneous trees. Poets and literati often carry wine and chant poems here. It is said that the mountain has a Song plum tree, but its sparse shadows and subtle fragrance are naturally like a painting. It is also a new scene outside Gushan. Mr. Wu Changshuo from Anji, also known as Lang Wan, once stayed briefly in Qixi, arranging a clear tour with bamboo hats and walking sticks. His leisurely mood was exclusively arranged with the mountain spirit. Burying the poetry master among ten thousand plum blossoms may not be a bad story for future generations.</p>
<p>Changshuo was good at seal carving. Outside of the Eight Masters of Xiling, he could win a seat. In his later years, he was covered by calligraphy and painting, calling himself Old Can and Deaf Man. The people of Fusang especially admired him. At the age of eighty-five, he returned to the Dao Mountain. Lang Wan was responsible for the matter of building the tomb, planning to buy a piece of land in Chaoshan. However, the monks of the mountain temple regarded it as a rare commodity and thought it was impossible. Although they had repeatedly discussed it, they were unwilling to agree. Finally, they obtained more than four mu of land, preparing to build a tomb. They dug mud, lifted stones, chopped thorns, and cleared bushes. It is now in good order, but the land price is more than a thousand gold.</p>
<p>The name of Hejing of Fox Hill is in West Lake, and his small pavilion is still there. Mr. Changshuo lived in seclusion in Shanghai, enjoying his pen and ink. His nobility is no less than that of Hejing. Burying his bones in Chaoshan with plum blossoms to accompany his soul can truly be said to be a reflection of the past and the present.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Four University English Speech Competition</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zhizheng</p>
<p>The Four University English Speech Competition is composed of four schools: Jiaotong, Jinan, Guanghua, and Fudan. It is held once a year and has never been interrupted. This year, it was held at the Wen Zhi Hall of Jiaotong University. The judges, such as Dr. Wu Jingxiong, Liu Yunfang, Li Daonan, Mrs. Huang Hanliang, and Chen Liting, are all well-known figures in society. On the afternoon of the 19th, Jiaotong University was already crowded with people and vehicles. The Wen Zhi Hall was packed with people. Here are some interesting details of the event:</p>
<p>About Laws and Regulations: Two rules were posted at the entrance of Wen Zhi Hall, which were quite special. One was (no entry or exit during the speech), and the other was (no applause after the speech). The former was probably to prevent disorder and prevent the speakers from concentrating, while the latter was probably to prevent emotionalism and hinder the judgment of fair people. The consideration was very thorough and could be used as a model for other speech competitions.</p>
<p>Talking About Love Science: The topics of the speeches by the representatives were quite interesting. The topics of the two female representatives were both on women's issues. Miss Zhu Yaozhen of Jiaotong University spoke on (Women's Sports), and Miss Chen Meier of Guanghua University spoke on (True Women), which attracted a lot of attention from the audience. The most wonderful was Mr. Peng Qixin of Fudan University, whose topic was (The Importance of Love Science). He cited ancient evidence and talked about love, saying that if love is not studied with scientific methods, it is difficult to achieve satisfactory results. For a time, the audience could not help but laugh.</p>
<p>Female General's Talents: The two female representatives who participated this time achieved very good results. Chen Meier of Guanghua University spoke eloquently and shocked the audience. Miss Zhu Yaozhen of Jiaotong University had a good attitude and a beautiful voice, which was rare. It is said that Miss Zhu usually practices very hard, and she often goes on stage to recite in the early morning. When Dr. Wu Jingxiong gave his personal comments, he praised her endlessly and praised her as a very promising speaker. It is said that she won first place in the individual competition at Jiaotong University's preliminary competition.</p>
<p>Dr. Wu's Witty Remarks: Before the awards were presented, Dr. Wu Jingxiong gave a speech. Dr. Wu said that someone had just talked about the science of love, and he should ask him for advice. He said that he himself was not good at giving speeches, but he felt that it was a pity that Chinese people spoke English, otherwise he would have spoken in Ningbo dialect today, which would have been even better. He also said that someone's voice was too low, almost like whispering in someone's ear. He was sitting in the back row and could not hear without a telephone. The audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Chen Liting Felt Ashamed: Mr. Chen Liting, the general manager of the YMCA, left after the judges finished their judging, but he did not leave the gate of Wen Zhi Hall. He was specially called back by the chairman and asked to present the awards. Chen said in his speech that the award presenter has always been a beautiful lady, and the recipient also feels supreme honor. Today, the chairman asked me to present the awards. I am not a lady and my face is also admired by you all. I feel extremely ashamed. As a result, Guanghua University won the championship and received a silver cup and a pennant.</p>
<p>Many Female Guests: There were many female guests in the venue that day. The fragrance of clothes and hair added a lot of color to the venue. After an investigation, it was learned that this large group of female guests were actually students from Guanghua University who came to cheer on their classmate Chen Meier. Since Guanghua won the pennant, they all smiled and returned happily.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Chrysanthemum Gathering at Dongjiadu</h3>
<p>— Wood and Stone Hermit</p>
<p>Yesterday was the date of the Chrysanthemum Gathering at the Dongjiadu Fire Administration. I was also invited. I drove there at about 6:00 PM. When I arrived, I climbed the stairs to the second floor. There were more than a hundred pots of colorful chrysanthemums, which were already a pleasure to see. The third floor was even richer. Most of the products from the San You family were luxurious and gorgeous, like the attitude of the Taiyuan son who came in a fur coat. The products from the Xiaoguan Garden were tall, elegant, and strange, which was in line with the Tao family's style. In particular, the one named "Xia Ding Shang Yi" was antique and was a rare item among the fine varieties. There were also four new varieties this year, one shaped like a bun with messy hair, like the wife of a warlord, colored light green; one colored light yellow, shaped like a hydrangea ball, but with belts and curls that do not reveal the flower heart; one colored Yang Fei, with fine tubes staggered to form a flying shape; and one colored light purple, shaped slightly the same. Solicit nominations, although many guests come to nominate, but the evaluation cannot be determined. At 7:00 PM, the guests were seated. The speakers all praised it as a spectacle. The dishes were presented one after another, and everyone drank to their heart's content. It is a pity that I could not drink much, which was a disappointment to the famous flowers. It is truly rare to have such an elegant and leisurely event in the flourishing and extravagant area of Shanghai. As for the elegance and cleanliness of the furnishings and the appropriateness of the arrangement, they are still extra things.</p>
<h3>A Record of Dr. Tang Yaoqin's Medical Skills</h3>
<p>— Yuyun Shanren</p>
<p>It is better to be a good doctor than a good prime minister. Although the two have different paths, their hearts to save the world and help the people are the same. My old friend, Dr. Tang Yaoqin, has always held this purpose. Before graduating from Zhejiang Provincial Medical School at the end of the Qing Dynasty, he witnessed the corruption of the Qing government and was worried about it. Therefore, he joined the party and traveled north and south, using medical skills to carry out his ambition. Dr. Tang was involved in the Xinhai Revolution, the Second Revolution of Gui Chou, and the Yuan-ousting campaign of Bingchen. After Yuan died and Li succeeded him, Dr. Tang devoted himself to reading, specializing in the medical classics of the Qing Dynasty. He studied the "Huangdi Neijing," "Suwen," "Zhang Zhongjing," and "Sun Simiao." He exhausted his efforts and thought with the ancients. He once said that the medical theory of our country is more subtle than that of Western medicine. Nowadays, it is gradually declining because general doctors only seek profit and do not pursue in-depth study, which makes Western medicine have a great tendency to replace it. Although Dr. Tang is a Western doctor, he cannot bear the loss of the essence of the country, and he uses scientific methods to improve and promote it. A few days ago, my wife's old illness recurred and she vomited blood. She was unable to stop the bleeding for several days, and her condition was critical. The doctors were helpless. I telegraphed from the front and rushed back, and urgently asked Dr. Tang to diagnose and treat her. He used both Chinese and Western medicine, and one medicine turned the situation around. After several visits, the blood stopped suddenly, and it was like a miracle cure. Although Dr. Tang does not boast about his medical skills, those who have broken their arms three times cannot surpass him. In recent years, he has organized an Eastern Medicine Research Society dedicated to researching Chinese medicines and chemically producing powder. He has invented a special medicine such as Xuegui, which is specially used to treat various bleeding disorders and is invariably effective like a god. Shen Jian, a medicine specially used to treat uterine diseases, such as tonifying blood, regulating menstruation, metrorrhagia, vaginal discharge, pre-pregnancy, and postpartum, is especially a gynecological medicine. There are also many effective medicines for various diseases of men, women, old and young, which cannot be described in detail. Countless relatives and friends have had intractable diseases that have been cured by Dr. Tang's diagnosis and treatment or by taking the elixir he invented. Although there are many Chinese and Western doctors in Shanghai, there are not many who are as knowledgeable in both Chinese and Western medicine as Dr. Tang. I know Dr. Tang deeply and have repeatedly persuaded him to go out into the world to achieve his original intention of saving the world and helping the people. Dr. Tang agreed to hang up a pot in the spring, so I will first introduce him in a word and tell the sick to know where to ask for help. (Dr. Tang is currently located at No. 58, Baokang Lane, Maisai Erdi Road, French Concession, along the road)</p>
<h3>A Record of the Young Calligrapher Zhang Qi</h3>
<p>— Rui Hongchu</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Taiyan is a master of Chinese studies in the contemporary era, and his literary name fills the world. He is also good at writing seal characters. He once received a scroll of seal characters from Mr. Zhang, and the brushwork is vigorous and lovable. Yesterday, Mrs. Zhang Tang Guoli and his son Zhang Qi came to the Minghua Store. Qi is seven years old, lively and lovely, and his words are excellent. His fingers are longer than ordinary people, about four inches long, sharp, thin, and soft, shaped like ivory tablets. Mr. Zhang named him "Qi" because of this. He is also good at calligraphy. A few months ago, when Mr. Ma Xiangbo celebrated his ninetieth birthday, Qi once wrote a couplet, which was praised by everyone. I took the opportunity to ask for a couplet and was honored to have him write it in one go. Watching his calligraphy, the brushwork is like dragons and snakes, which is even more improved than in the past. He is truly a child prodigy.</p>
<h3>Travels in Nanyang (79)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>Arrived in Yangon on the 27th, already within the Indian border. Yangon was originally a port in Myanmar but has long been a province of British India. Though the people of Myanmar have been striving for autonomy, and it has been granted, its politics, education, and culture are entirely Indian, vastly different from East Asia. Reaching this point is like entering another world, different from the previous one. First, Myanmar is a purely Buddhist country for over a thousand years. Second, women in Myanmar hold a very high position. Third, although Myanmar is Indianized, northern Myanmar, near Yunnan's Pianma and other areas, has much contact with China. There are quite a few people from Yunnan in northern Myanmar and China, hence Buddhism is also very flourishing in Yunnan. The most famous is Chicken Foot Mountain near Yunnan. Wu Meicun's poem says (Pu'er and Cangshan are the Zou and Lu of Buddhism). From this, the Buddhist relationship between Yunnan and Myanmar is evident. Upon first staying at the Mingli Inn, I immediately visited Master Daojie of Longhua Temple, who was the master who initially ordained me. The Master has been the abbot of Fayuan Temple in Beiping for many years.</p>
<p>That temple was where the Qing emperors received ordination. Tagore was welcomed here the year before. The Master has traveled in Myanmar for a long time and kept diaries of his travels in the border areas of Yunnan, upper Myanmar, and central Myanmar. He has conducted in-depth investigations and research on the history of Myanmar's relationship with China and the customs of the Burmese people. He has traveled to India twice and says that Myanmar has a very rich collection of Buddhist scriptures. He was invited to translate Nepali scriptures, which are also rich. The Buddhist statues are beautiful, surpassing those everywhere, especially the statues of Ceylon, which are even more beautiful than those in Yangon.</p>
<p>At this time, Myanmar was already in the rainy season. It rains all day long. According to tradition, no matter who enters a temple or pagoda, they must take off their shoes. Taking off shoes is a sacred custom for the Burmese people. I mentioned before that a major incident occurred because a British official refused to take off his shoes. Master Daojie described it in detail. It happened in Mandalay, the old capital of Myanmar, where a British military officer, a brigade commander, refused to take off his shoes and clashed with monks. A monk cut his face with a knife. Seven or eight monks were arrested, leading to a major revolt by the Burmese monks and people. The matter was taken to London. The British Emperor decreed that British subjects should abide by the customs, traditions, and etiquette of each country they visit and should not refuse to take off their shoes. Thus, the Burmese won the lawsuit, and the morale of the entire Burmese people was greatly boosted. From this, we can see the British ability to pacify small countries. Their dominance over various ethnic groups is no accident. After this incident, anyone entering a temple area, even without entering the interior, must take off their shoes. It is said that only Wang Jingwei was specially permitted to not take off his shoes when he visited the Shwedagon Pagoda once. However, that incident occurred before the Burmese people's lawsuit against the British military officer was won.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (81)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>Diary of a Tour of Italy</p>
<p>(III) Ten Days in Rome (IV)</p>
<p>The Eternal City—La ville eternelle</p>
<p>June 1st. Spanish Masterpieces Exhibition and Japanese Modern Painting Exhibition. 36 (Jesus Stripped of His Garments - El Espolio) This is Greco's most famous and valuable masterpiece, completed in 1579. It is a decorative painting for the Toledo Cathedral. The crowded and complex warriors exhibit an unusually solemn style. Christ and his apostles are filled with somber and bleak visages. The entire painting is a combination of simple two-color combinations of blue and yellow, blue and green, green and red, orange and blue, and blue and red.</p>
<p>41 (Saint Martin and the Beggar) This is a powerful and tragic contrast, a feeling of morbid excitement, expressing an extraordinary depiction of deep inner life.</p>
<p>Velasquez was the master who succeeded Greco and founded the Spanish school. He was skilled at portrait painting. In 1623, he went to Madrid to become a court painter. Encouraged by Rubens, he traveled to Italy twice to copy many of Titian's paintings. He completed his realism after being influenced by Titian and Ribera. His maturity was accelerated by his contact with Venetian painters, and their influence transformed his style. Soon, he succeeded in conveying natural truthfulness as a painter. Although he was a court painter of magnificent portraits, he also loved to paint cripples and the working class. This exhibition included many of his portraits and copies of Titian's paintings, which France had never seen before. The lightness, transparency of his colors, and his aerial perspective had never been achieved to such a degree before.</p>
<p>Goya was a great painter of the late 18th century. He maintained the Spanish tradition while being a pioneer of Impressionism. His dynamic and unrestrained brushstrokes could touch the power of life and serve as the foundation for modern art.</p>
<p>Morilo, a religious painter, was one of the most deeply influenced by the Florentine school. Although he was a disciple of Velasquez, their painting styles were completely different.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Show Signs of Improvement</h3>
<p>Gold prices have been rising erratically. Yesterday, the 21st, the benchmark gold price showed signs of improvement, and although there was some suppressed activity, it eventually rose again. A total of four taels and five mace of difference occurred throughout the day. Demand from fellow traders exceeded supply, but trading was still active. Companies such as Fuchang, Yuancheng, Yongji, and Wupin were all actively buying, while Shunli, Tai Kangrun, Yuanyuanmao, Yongji, and others were all selling. Overseas silver markets rose slightly, but without any special changes. As a result, gold prices did not show any significant boom or bust. Buyers quickly became more numerous. As foreign exchange appeared to be tightening, and traders had previously engaged in arbitrage of English gold, market sentiment was stimulated, and gold prices gradually rose from eighty-four taels to eighty-seven taels. Around noon, Zhifeng, Yongtai, Kangrun, and others sold off their holdings, and the market returned to a flat trend, with a decrease of one tael. In the afternoon, Tai Kangrun, Jinan, and Wupin saw strong buying interest, and the exchange rates also showed positive signs. The market situation suddenly surged, breaking through eighty-eight taels. Banks had bought English gold at 1725 after the first month. At the last minute, the exchange market suddenly loosened, and companies such as Yuanxing and Yongfu quickly moved to sell off their holdings, causing a rapid retreat, dropping two taels to between eighty-six taels. The state of the market became unpredictable and difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>Progress was seen step by step. In the early morning, the benchmark gold price opened slightly higher, by one mace, at 584 taels (gross weight around four taels). Large bars continued to rise by one-sixteenth, while silver prices remained unchanged, so gold prices were still able to hold their ground. Later, Fuchang, Yuanmaoyong, and retail investors all entered the market, and banks also traded English gold for January delivery at 1731.25. Mitsui also bought existing Dalian gold at 1 tael 2 mace 7 fen, causing gold prices to rise frequently, reaching 86 taels 23 mace when the exchange rate was announced. However, with some fluctuations around one tael, the listed exchange rates did not move, and Dongya and others sold off English gold for December delivery at 1725. Mitsui offered January delivery at 1731.25, causing prices to fall back by 89 mace, reaching 5 taels 4 mace at 10 o'clock, with hedgers also selling off. After that, the buying side seemed to turn bullish, with traders such as Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxing, Yongcheng, Fengyong, Xieyu, and Wupin all actively buying, mainly because English gold also showed strength. Shanghai offered January delivery at 1725, Macgalli bought December, Citibank 39 yuan, and speculators were actively arbitrage trading. The gold price jumped by 1 tael 67 mace, reaching 7 taels 1 mace at 11 o'clock. Fuchang and others then shorted exchange, issuing sell orders, with Tai Kangrun, Zhifeng, Yongji, and others selling jointly, causing the price to fall by one tael. At 11:40, the price was 5 taels 9 mace, but without excessive weakness. Only four or five minutes later, it was pulled up to 6 taels 3 mace, with Yuanmaoyong buying. At noon closing, the price was 86 taels. Wupin suddenly came in to buy, pushing the price up by 45 mace. Wupin closed at 6 taels 5 mace, with the listed price still at 618 taels 6 mace, a discount of 323 taels.</p>
<p>The market was volatile in the afternoon. The market opened at 86 taels 8 mace, but after an Indian exchange report, the price fell from 6 taels 9 mace to 6 taels 4 mace. Later, many buyers, including Zhifengyong, Tai Kangrun, and retail investors, entered the market, pushing the price up to 7 taels 6 mace. Fuchang and others sold off their holdings, again suppressing the price by a small amount. At 2:30, the price was 6 taels 67 mace. The Maihang company offered English gold for January delivery at 1725, and Wah Bi sold to Zhengjin for April delivery at 1731.25. The market then stabilized at around 7 taels. Around 3 o'clock, the situation suddenly showed signs of firmness. Mitsui bought 1 tael 2 mace 6 fen 9375 of gold for January delivery, and banks traded English gold for January delivery at 1725. Yuancheng, Yongyi, Dafuchang, and Xinheng were all actively buying. At 3:30, the price was 8 taels 12 mace. Hedgers then came to sell, immediately dropping the price by 89 mace to 7 taels 34 mace. In a short period of time, Tai Kangrun and others came to buy again. With demand exceeding supply on the trading floor, the price surged by 1 tael 2 mace, reaching 88 taels 5 mace at 4 o'clock. The price then stabilized. Around 4:10, Yuanxing, Yongfu, Changji, and others suddenly came to sell on the market, and it was heard that Wah Bank was selling English gold for January delivery at 1725. All the banks were willing to sell, causing the market to decline, with a sudden storm dropping more than two taels. Recently, the Japanese Bank of Japan bought 1 tael 2 mace 7 fen 25. The market closed at 4:30 at 86 taels 1 mace. The highest price for the day was 88 taels 5 mace, and the lowest price was 84 taels, a difference of 4 taels 5 mace. The listed price was a discount of 32 taels 5 mace, with accounts recorded at 93 taels, 89 taels, and 86 taels. Supplemental water was 93 taels. Wupin was 4 taels in the early morning, 6 taels 5 mace at noon, and 6 taels 6 mace in the afternoon, closing at 6 taels 1 mace.</p>
<p>Demand exceeded supply, with Fuchang, Wanxing, Xieyu, Yu Da, Da Decheng, Chen Fengyong, and Yuancheng Yong all actively buying. Yuanmaoyong, Shunli, Tai Kangrun, and Neixing were all selling. Zhifengyong, Yuanxingyong, Yongfeng, and Changshengyong were inconsistent in their buying and selling. Wupin was buying in the afternoon. Zhifengyong and Yuanxingyong bought and then sold. Jinan, Yu Da, Tai Kangrun, and Wupin were all buying. Yuanmaoyong, Changji, and Wanxing were buying and selling intermittently. Shunli and Yufa Yong were all selling. The Dalian gang sold a total of 1,000 bars and bought 460 bars. Trading among the Guangdong gang was quiet, with the previous short positions gradually being covered, and the current position is roughly balanced.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Shows a Steady Trend</h3>
<p>Overseas silver markets rose slightly yesterday, with little trading and no significant changes in market conditions. Exchange rates rose, with the Japanese and American rates remaining the same as before. HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates remained unchanged. The domestic market was initially flat, then strengthened, and the gold market trended towards a peak. In the early afternoon, the market was very firm, but near the close, it suddenly loosened, causing a setback in the gold market. Demand and supply among traders were divergent, but overall, the market still rose by two taels compared to the previous day. As a result, English gold also shrank by 0.0625, American exchange shrank by 0.125, and Japanese gold increased by 0.375. Trading among Chinese merchants was still active. English gold transactions totaled 300,000 pounds, with over 200,000 pounds being shorted. The supply from banks was still insufficient. Banks such as Dongya, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Shanghai Sansing, Hefeng, Zhejiang HSBC, and others all sold off their holdings. Fuchang and other gold firms mostly issued short orders. Banks also traded tens of thousands of pounds with each other. Chinese merchants sold off US dollars by 200,000 yuan, which Wah Bi and Macgalli absorbed. The Dalian gang sold off Japanese exchange rates by tens of thousands of yuan, which Mitsui absorbed. The market situation appeared to be stable.</p>
<h3>Large and Small Bars Both Increased</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's London telegraph, large bar silver prices both increased. The near-term rate increased by 0.0625 to 16 pence 6875 (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 pence 75 of English gold), and the far-term rate also increased by 0.0625 to 16 pence 5625. Spot India absorbed slightly, but trading was still not much, and the market situation was calm. According to yesterday's New York telegraph, American silver prices did not fluctuate, with the spot price still at 36 cents. The English-to-American exchange rate increased by 0.0625, and the American-to-English exchange rate increased by 0.03125, both totaling 4 dollars 85 cents 6875. The Japanese-to-American exchange rate remained at 49 yuan 625, the English-to-Japanese exchange rate was still 2 shillings 053125, and the English-to-Shanghai shilling exchange rate increased by 0.125 to 1 shilling 7 pence 625. Spot Mumbai still had no fluctuations, remaining at 47 rupees 07 annas. There were no changes in subsequent telegrams.</p>
<h3>The Liri Disassembly Market Is Extremely Unreliable</h3>
<p>The general market situation has been quiet for days, and there is very little important news. Yesterday's situation was even quieter. The foreign liri price fell again and eventually, transactions were scarce, and the atmosphere was not encouraging. The Guangdong angle in auxiliary coins is as firm as ever, probably because there are few spot goods on the market.</p>
<p>Liri Decomposition Price (Foreign Liri) The early market was 7 yuan, 2 fen, 6 li, 2 hao and a half. The afternoon market was 7 yuan, 2 fen, 5 li, 7 suddenly half. There was a difference of half a li between the early and afternoon markets. (Silver Decomposition) The early market was 9 fen, and the afternoon market was 1 yuan and 1 fen.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market: A Quiet Situation</h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and bleak, but the overseas cotton yarn market is very weak, and people are not encouraged. However, the current yarn sales are still good. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs are more robust, and if demand can continue to be smooth, the market may turn around slightly. However, the stock of 20-count Five Fortune Shepherd yarn is too large, and the market is being suppressed by it.</p>
<p>People are bidding flat. The market atmosphere was slightly invigorated when the Chao gang shorted the previous market, so although American cotton fell, the market trend was still firm. The second and third markets were slightly sluggish. As a result, the prices for each month were flat. In the afternoon, it was heard that although actual sales were smooth, people were generally flat. Each month rose slightly by 1, 2, or 3 coins. Total transactions for the day were estimated at 8,000 bales. Cha Jiedu shipped 650 bales, Shenji 600 bales, Yongfeng 100 bales, Tiandang 300 bales, and the rest 2300 bales. Maji bought 1,000 bales, Dafeng 550 bales, Xiesheng 800 bales, and the rest 2300 bales. The closing price is recorded on the left. People bid for the closing price to rise and fall in the amount of stock prices rise and fall in the amount of stock November 1451...2 1450 February 1478 up 1 3290 December 1460 up 1 3060 March 1489...1 2250 January 146...3 470 April 1494...1 1300</p>
<p>Current sales are slightly active. The current yarn sales are more active. The Sichuan and Yunnan gangs are more robust. It is estimated that the total number of packages bought by various gangs throughout the day is 3,212. 600 packages were received from the same industry, 600 packages were received from the mainland, 1,375 packages were received from Sichuan from the guest gang, 1,372 packages were received from Yunnan, 100 packages were received from Guangdong, 45 packages were received from Anqing, 80 packages were received from the mainland, 110 packages were received from Shantou, and 130 packages were received from miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market: Calm Atmosphere</h3>
<p>The cotton market is flat, mainly because the price of American cotton has fallen, which has slightly exhausted the minds of people, and the actual digestion is exceptionally sluggish. Each factory has no hope of development, mainly because the price of Indian cotton is cheaper, and factories at home and abroad have absorbed large quantities. Also, the amount of packages is very large, but the situation in the local cotton market is relatively tight because farmers are reluctant to sell, and most of the flower merchants shorted in November.</p>
<p>The price of the Han label is stable.

<h3>Foreign Yarn and Flowers Have Absolutely No Improvement</h3>

<h3>Grain and Rice Markets Are Steadily Declining</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were more than 50 rice boats arriving at the port from various routes in Zhabei. The sales floors of each stall were still quiet. The trading has been sluggish for days. There are more than 150 boats in stock in the river, and the accumulation of new japonica rice is particularly high, and the high-quality goods are extremely scarce, so the particularly top-quality rice, such as Yin Sida and other boat japonica rice, is still open at around 15 yuan, and the rest of the market price is all between 14 yuan, 6 and 7 corners. The overall market fell by about 23 corners. The price drop of the thin indica rice was even more severe. The especially high price was only 13 yuan and 50 cents, but there were still few buyers. The top-quality Yang Xian rice was extremely scarce, and the high price was expected to be 12 yuan and 50 cents. Du Jian was 12 yuan and 60 cents. The overall short price has dropped sharply, and retail investors are watching from the sidelines. The price has dropped by 34 corners. The ordinary price is 11 yuan and 80 cents, and the guest tip has shrunk to 11 yuan and 30 cents. The arrival of the Yuanbian goods has turned scarce, and the digestion is special. The price is still 14 yuan and 70 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were about 30 boats arriving downstream of the river in Hu Nan. The sales of this street were extremely stagnant. The top goods of Changbang new japonica rice were still priced at 14 yuan, 4 and 5 corners. As for the goods in the middle gate, they all had to fall back by 3 corners. The trading of Su Tong japonica rice was extremely scarce. Customers in urban and rural areas were preventing further declines. They all showed intention to enter. The slightly moving price was only 12 yuan, 3 and 4 corners. The downward trend of the early rice of the Nambang roads was even more severe. The high price of 45 corners was required to be 12 yuan, 6 and 7 corners. The middle gate was 12 yuan. Yang Xian was slightly soft for 1 corner. Du Jian was half corner. The general trend was also lackluster. The sales of Yinyuan tended to be weak. The owners' intention to sell turned keen, and the market was tired for 2 corners. Foreign high-quality goods were priced at around 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Flour Market Is More Bleak Than Usual</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market in each month saw a period of excitement, because the quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago was good by 1, 2, and 3 corners, and Canada was good by 6 and 7 corners, so when the price opened, the current month had been raised to 2 yuan, 1 cent, and 9 cents, and each month in the long term was also better than the previous day by about 1 cent. However, after the second market, it became soft again because the environment was still not good. Most of the bulls no longer had the idea of ​​stiffening the price. The current month is about to expire, and the actual sales are still quiet. Many buyers are returning the goods in a surge, and the market has become unstable again. By the time the market opened in the morning, floating buyers and large households were still returning the goods, and the market atmosphere in each month was extremely bleak. Each market was gradually opening and falling. The environment has not changed, and the chips of small and medium-sized factories are becoming more and more. There is little hope for a major turning point in the future situation. As a result, the current month fell by 2 cents and 2 li and a half compared with the previous day. December was a small 1 cent and 7 li and a half. January was a small 2 cents and 2 li and a half. February was a small 1 cent and 7 li and a half. March was a small 1 cent and a half. April was a small 1 cent and 7 li and a half.</p>
<h3>The Wheat Market Started Stable and Then Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market showed a stable and tired image in the morning and afternoon. At the beginning of the morning, the reported price of foreign wheat made people feel expensive. The current month once opened to 4 yuan, 2 yuan and 7 cents, but in the subsequent markets, because most of the short sellers in the current month were factories, they had all prepared actual goods. At this time, when the flour sales were depressed, the factories turned their positions and did things on the contrary. The more people who hand over the goods, the more likely they are to be suppressed, so they gradually returned the goods and the market turned weak. Judging from the outcome of the current month, it is not surprising that it may fall to the 1 yuan mark, because the fact that there are more suppliers than demand is the fatal wound of the bulls. As a result, the current month was 3 cents smaller than the previous day, December January was unchanged, February and March were small for 2 cents, and April was unchanged. The current wheat market is mostly watched by factories, and the market is very quiet. The whole city is only opening and returning Zhenjiang. 400 packages were sold at 3 yuan, 5 yuan and 2 cents, which were handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Is Difficult To Approach</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the guest indica rice market still showed no hope of development. Because the guest gang has not continued to do it, the market is still difficult to turn better by pressing the price on the street. However, the price of the production area is high and there are not many arrivals at the head, and the price is not easy to fall. Yesterday, Nanjing rice from the street was handled for more than 200 packages, priced at 10 yuan to 9 yuan and 56 cents. Also, 160 packages of Hunan machine Jing, newly arrived, were priced at 10 yuan and 7 cents. However, the foreign yuan is welcomed by the northern routes, and the market situation is better than that of foreign indica rice. In recent days, many gangs from Zhilu and Dong Province have been packing and handling it. Yesterday, a Tianjin gang handled 350 packages of Hunan machine yuan, priced at 13 yuan and 23 cents. The arrival and storage of foreign rice has been lacking, and the market has been quiet for a long time. Shanghai merchants intend to try to handle it to Shen to alleviate the lack of high foreign indica rice. However, according to the news from foreign firms yesterday, the selling price in the production area has increased, and the current orders are not suitable, because the No. 1 high Saigon in February and March needs 5 yuan and 2 cents, which is difficult to approach in the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>Soybean Price Surge Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the standard futures soybeans continued to rise. Prices in Dalian production areas repeatedly increased because Western foreign firms were actively purchasing. Domestic traders and re-export traders had a strong appetite for spot soybeans. At noon, the price rose more than half a cent to 4.8 taels per picul. Market observers are generally eyeing the 4.9 tael mark. Trading was excellent in both the morning and afternoon sessions, with all months rising by six to seven points. At closing, December and February futures opened at 4.81 taels, January futures at 4.82 taels, and March and April futures at 4.8 taels. Soybean cake futures also saw improvement due to the rise in both the bean and the overall market, with the March opening at 1.59 taels, up more than three points based on the two-five discount rate. The April price, however, remained unchanged at 1.5975 taels.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, Spring Dried Cocoons, Factories and Merchants Holding Out</h3>
<p>Recently, silk factories have been trying to resume production and replenish raw materials in accordance with government advice. However, due to exceptionally low overseas silk prices, they are unwilling to purchase at high prices. Remnant cocoon merchants, aware of the insufficient inventory of dry cocoons, are holding firm on prices, refusing to sell unless the price is high. Negotiations for spring dried cocoons have been difficult for days, with factories offering only slightly above 600 taels per load, leading to a standoff between factories and merchants, with no transactions reported.</p>
<h3>White Filature Still Not Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' silk market in this port remained stagnant. Green silk and overseas Shanghai slightly increased via telegraph, but the Shanghai market remained stagnant. However, there was considerable demand for white filature from English and Indian firms, keeping transactions fairly active. Yesterday, Xinyi Chang and other firms brought in 35 bales of medium- and low-grade white filature, with prices remaining firm.</p>
<h3>Pingshui Coarse Tea for American Sales Slightly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firms' tea market in this port saw slight activity in the sales of Huzhou Pingshui coarse tea to America, with total sales of over 800 chests. Prices were about one to two taels lower than before. Although Luzhuang, Zhenmei, Baochang, Tianyu, and other firms had some appetite, the overall situation was not favorable. Jinlong foreign firm continued to buy Needle and Xiu teas yesterday, but high prices are still difficult to expect in the market. Transactions with Russia for the Gongxi variety became more subdued yesterday, making it harder for market to hold steady.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth, Nine-Pound Coarse Cloth in Great Shortage</h3>
<p>Lately, coarse cloth has been the strongest in the local cotton cloth market, with available stock quickly selling out. This is due to the weather turning cold and an increase in military demand, especially for lower-grade goods. As a result, yesterday, the nine-pound cloth was completely sold out, with the Yihe's Five Bats and Shuanglong brands completely out of stock. Forward orders for delivery in one week require 4.325 taels. There is strong demand for the thirteen-pound cloth from the Changjiang traders. Yesterday, Shuangying, Magou all needed six taels, Shuang Ma 5.975 taels. The sixteen-pound Five Crane was also out of stock yesterday, with Mudan opening at 7.275 taels. Fine cloth and fine twill did not see much activity, while coarse twill, Five Yuanbao and Renta brands were out of stock. The San Tu Er Yu was sold yesterday for 5.25 taels.</p>
<p>The western textiles market still had no sign of improvement yesterday. This is mainly because the settlement date is just over a month away, and those with tighter cash flow need to prepare in advance, resulting in weak demand. Transactions on this street are dwindling day by day, but merchants are still active. Sichuan traders brought in over a hundred pieces of fine broadcloth and Yuhua velvet yesterday. Traders from Changsha, Shashi, Hankou, and other places also sent telegrams to replenish stock. As a result, fine broadcloth and Zhigong ni wool fabrics have not fallen excessively. Yesterday, fine broadcloth Gu Hui still opened at 3.4 taels, Baoqiu in various colors were out of stock, and Bald Blue-Grey sold for 3.35 taels. Huxinting was at three taels. Zhigong ni wool fabrics Santan brand was in stock at 3.55 taels, Lieyan 3.325 taels, Moganshan 3.25 taels, but Sanyou Tu had plummeted to 1.925 taels.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Middle Sand White Opens at 2,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received news from producing areas that Cuban raw sugar was priced at 1.375, and New York futures sugar for December was at 1.30, up five points from the previous telegraph. The price for March of next year was 1.44, for May 1.52, each up six points. The price for September was 1.64, also up five points. The current price for Java raw sugar and December futures sugar were both 7.9375, and the price for January of next year was 8.00, showing no rise or fall compared to before. The association market scheduled a plate of Dutch sugar No. 24, coarse sand white, which was arriving in large quantities. With slow sales, the market looked even more sluggish, with offers at 7.55 taels with no buyers. No. 20 middle sand white was at 6.7 taels, finely ground sand white at 7.6 taels, No. 10 Dutch red at 6.4 taels. Both sales and purchases were quiet, and the market was generally flat and dull. Transactions in Japanese sugar were withering. Lower-grade goods also seemed to drop in price. N mark price was still 7.65 taels, YT mark 7.55 taels, YRO mark 7.075 taels, TM mark 7.1 taels, TX mark 7.725 taels, TK mark 7.55 taels, YP mark 7.875 taels, J mark 7.95 taels. The market condition was weak, and plate transactions were also quiet. Jinfahao sold 2,000 bags of current No. 20 medium sugar, with a value of 6.7 taels. The market was not surprised that the original 3,000 bags could not be sold through.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Fungus Market Flat</h3>
<p>Recently, not many fungus have arrived, but the market has sufficient inventory. However, traders' appetite is not very smooth. Both Guangdong and Fujian provinces have reduced their harvests. As for the local mainland, the transactions are scattered. Yesterday, the top-grade large fungus sold for 170 taels, the native brand fungus for 110 taels, and mixed fungus from 102-103 taels to 100 taels. The market looks flat.</p>
<h3>Metals and Eastern Goods, New Lead Wires Arriving</h3>
<p>After the source of new lead wires was deemed scarce, the standard prices rose sharply. No. 16 to No. 20 were estimated at 12.5 taels per load, and No. 21 to No. 25 sold for 15.5 taels, but the market had little inventory. Therefore, the general industry firms were actively purchasing Japanese goods to prepare for market sales. As a result, the port of Zhanjiang is very active now. It is estimated that the various companies have four to five thousand bundles in storage. Fortunately, customer sales are still strong, so the market prices have not fallen back. It was found that 560-70 bundles were opened yesterday, with Tianjin and Hankou traders making the most progress.</p>

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Train Accident Repaired Yesterday</h3>
<p>Passengers and staff were unharmed.</p>
<p>The railway bureau suffered losses of 100,000.</p>
<p>Trains will operate as usual today.</p>
<p>Details of the accident that occurred on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway involving the 20th third- and fourth-class slow train from Beijing to Shanghai between Huangdu and Anting last night were reported briefly in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a more detailed account of the situation at the time and the status of train operations yesterday.</p>
<p>Details of the accident: The train was originally scheduled to arrive at Shanghai North Station at 8:45 PM, but was delayed by more than two hours. There was no prior warning, which led to the disaster. The accident site was at the beginning of the 26th kilometer, near Bridge No. 24, not far from Huangdu Station. There were patrol guards stationed there, and military barracks were built, but the bandits managed to achieve their destructive goals, which was quite unexpected. On both sides of the tracks, the bandits pried off screws.</p>
<h3>Rescue vehicle uses crane to lift the train</h3>
<p>(Special correspondent from this newspaper photographed)</p>
<p>Six screws were removed, and four fishplates connecting the two rails were also removed. As a result, when the train passed through the area, the locomotive managed to get through because of its greater power, but the iron shed guard car, a 40-ton shed car, four fourth-class passenger cars, and two third-class passenger cars behind it all derailed due to the rails loosening outward, and tilted slightly outward. Fortunately, the driver noticed early and immediately stopped the train, so the last five passenger cars did not derail. The passengers in the derailed cars were in the process of organizing their belongings as they were about to arrive in Shanghai when they suddenly heard a loud noise and saw the cars tilting outward, as if they were about to fall. They were greatly alarmed, and the order was extremely chaotic. The guard of the rear car learned that there was danger ahead, immediately jumped off the train, and rushed to Huangdu Station to report and request assistance. He also tried to help the passengers out of the derailed cars and into the rear cars. Shanghai North Station immediately sent telegrams to the relevant officials to come to the station to provide assistance. However, it was already midnight, and the craftsmen had dispersed, so the rescue train could not be dispatched immediately. It was not until 8:00 AM yesterday morning that the craftsmen arrived, totaling more than 100 people. They were led by the chief of the locomotive department and traveled to the scene of the accident on the rescue train. A separate empty train was sent to pick up the passengers and bring them to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Rescue situation: When the rescue train arrived at the scene of the accident, the damaged tracks were completely removed, and new tracks and sleepers were laid. The guard car, the 40-ton shed car, and the No. 612 fourth-class car, which were less damaged, were placed on the rails first. There were still three fourth-class cars, Nos. 805, 901, and 902, and two third-class cars, Nos. 79 and 84, that were leaning too much and could not be lifted by hooks. Liquid oxygen was used to burn off the hooks, and then cranes were used to lift them one at a time onto the rails. The craftsmen worked tirelessly from morning to evening, and the damaged vehicles were repaired and sent to the Zhabei Factory for repair at 7:00 PM last night.</p>
<p>Train operations: After learning of the accident, Shanghai North Station urgently telegraphed Nanxiang to stop the special express train from Shanghai to Beijing, which had already departed, and ordered the original train to return to the North Station. All passengers were allowed to refund their tickets at the original price. The upward intercity trains from Shanghai to Wuxi, Changzhou, Kunshan, and Anting, and the downward intercity trains from Changshu, Wuxi, Kunshan, and Anting to Shanghai were temporarily suspended. However, through trains between Beijing and Shanghai and between Beijing and Hangzhou continued to operate as usual. However, passengers had to get off the train at the accident site and walk dozens of yards before transferring to another train to reach their destination. Therefore, the schedules of all trains yesterday were unpredictable. Passengers were only allowed to carry light luggage. Last night, the No. 10 express train from Shanghai to Hangzhou, which was originally scheduled to depart at 5:50 PM, was delayed until after 9:00 PM due to waiting for passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai through train. The special express trains from Shanghai to Beijing and from Beijing to Shanghai, which departed at 11:00 PM last night, added an extra train due to overcrowding. Trains will operate as usual from today.</p>
<p>Loss situation: According to a post-accident investigation, no passengers or train staff were injured, and no items were lost. However, the losses in terms of vehicles and materials were considerable, estimated at around 100,000 yuan. The Railway Bureau has reported this to the Ministry of Railways and has strictly ordered the police along the route to increase patrols to ensure the safety of travelers.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Discussing Consolidation of Internal Debt</h3>
<p>The Banking Association Initiates a Creditors' Group</p>
<p>Banking Industries in Pingjin Send Representatives to Participate</p>
<p>National Creditors Will Register</p>
<p>Riri News reports that the Ministry of Finance has been holding meetings in Beijing for days regarding the consolidation of foreign debt, but plans for internal debt consolidation have not yet been discussed. The banking industry in this port believes that with the domestic war pacified and domestic products now able to flow freely, the revitalization of industry and the development of the national economy are imminent. However, the amount of internal debt is very large and urgently needs to be consolidated to establish a foundation for revitalizing industrial capital. Therefore, at noon the day before yesterday, the Shanghai Banking Association convened Zhang Gongquan, President of the Bank of China, Hu Mengjia, Manager of the Bank of Communications, Xiao Fuxiao, Manager of the Continental Bank, Wu Yunzhai, Manager of the Jincheng Bank, Chen Zheqing, Manager of the Yanyeh Bank, and Li Fuxun, Chairman of the Bank of China, at the Banking Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road to discuss the matter. It was agreed that internal debt consolidation should not be delayed and that a creditors' group should be established to request the Ministry of Finance to begin consolidation in the near future. However, the specific consolidation plan should be determined by the Banking Association convening the Shanghai banking community to form a creditors' group for the banking portion of Chinese internal debt. A telegram was sent to the Banking Associations of Beiping and Tianjin seeking their agreement to send representatives to Shanghai for a meeting at a fixed date. Other banking communities in other ports were not notified due to the lack of internal debt relationships. After the establishment of the bank internal debt creditors' group, a report will be submitted to solicit creditors across the country to register internal debt. At 7 PM last night, the Beiping Banking Association sent a reply expressing its support and appointed Tan Danya, President of the Continental Bank of Shanghai, and Zhou Zuomin, President of the Jincheng Bank, as representatives of the Beiping Banking Association. However, the date of the formal meeting has not yet been set. The total amount of foreign debt is approximately 130 million yuan in national currency, of which internal debt accounts for three-tenths and strong foreign debt accounts for seven-tenths and is weak. Although a plan for foreign debt consolidation has been drafted, it has not yet been announced. It is roughly based on a certain item of national fiscal revenue as the basis for foreign debt settlement, and it is expected that internal debt can be fully repaid within 30 years, and China's economic position in the international community can also be independent.</p>
<h3>Central Temporary Coupon Holders Association Submits Document to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Requesting Immediate Recall and Full Redemption: Yesterday, the United Association of Holders of Central Bank Temporary Exchange Coupons submitted a document to Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the National Government, stating that the Central Bank's temporary exchange coupons had been delayed in redemption, causing immense suffering, and requesting sympathy and immediate authorization for full redemption to alleviate commercial difficulties and benefit the people. The Central Bank temporary exchange coupons were issued on August 26, 1926, with the approval of the National Government when you, Mr. Chairman, were serving as Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army, and were entrusted to the General Headquarters Political Affairs Bureau and Treasury. The coupon amount was five million silver dollars, with denominations of one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. The coupons were stamped with the seal of the General Headquarters Political Affairs Bureau and the official seals of the Treasury Director, and the issuance regulations were formulated and promulgated by the General Headquarters, and a notice was issued to inform merchants and the public to accept and use them equally and fully, without any delay or negligence. The National Revolutionary Army fought for principles and worked hard for the nation and the people. The righteous army was welcomed everywhere by the masses, and the army traveled thousands of miles with great hardship and meritorious achievements shining like the sun and the moon. The people looked up to the grand plans and unanimously expressed their gratitude and support. No one in history has gained the hearts of the people as much as you, Mr. Chairman. The people's faith in you, Mr. Chairman, was so strong, and their enthusiasm for welcoming the Revolutionary Army was so great that they all accepted and used these Central Bank temporary exchange coupons, which contributed greatly to the Northern Expedition military campaign. You, Mr. Chairman, are wise and intelligent and will not disregard this fact. However, for some unknown reason, the coupons suddenly stopped being redeemed later, causing panic and distress among merchants holding the coupons, who ran around in a state of shock and anxiety, repeatedly appealing without being approved for the past four years, suffering considerable losses. You, Mr. Chairman, have been deeply concerned and caring for the people, and we trust that you have seen all this suffering. Now that the Yan-Feng warlords have completely collapsed, the reactionary forces have been almost completely wiped out, the country is unified, the foundation is solid, and national and public welfare are flourishing. You, Mr. Chairman, have been working hard to follow the teachings of the late Premier and to respond to the national sentiment of the people, and you have been working diligently to promote good governance, remove the old and establish the new, and start anew with the people. All domestic and foreign public debts have been consolidated, and the country's prestige is growing day by day, and the revitalization of the people's livelihood is imminent. Since the Central Bank temporary exchange coupons are related to the revolution and their nature is different from internal debt, they cannot be compared with other internal debts. Moreover, during the Northern Expedition military campaign, the Central Bank Ocean Coupons for the three provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi, the Small Ocean Coupons for the three provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangxi, and the Hankou banknotes of the Central Bank, which were issued after the Central Temporary Exchange Coupons, have all been consolidated and closed. Why have you delayed the consolidation of the Central Temporary Exchange Coupons? This seems unfair and does not accord with the way to love the people. Merchants are deeply concerned and have no choice but to petition you, Mr. Chairman, to consider the difficulties of merchants and the plight of the people, and to grant an order to the Ministry of Finance to immediately recall and fully redeem the Central Bank temporary exchange coupons to alleviate commercial difficulties and benefit the people. We are extremely grateful and pray to you with tears in our eyes.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Consolidates Branches</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the second board meeting passed several consolidation plans.

<h3>Wenzhou Donation Storm Affects Shanghai Shipping and Freight</h3>
<p>Dockworkers have gone on strike, and freight transport has been blocked and delayed. It is feared that this will lead to a strike in the city. In Wenzhou, merchants are protesting against the increase in taxes on foreign and Cantonese goods, leading to a freight strike. The two sides are not giving way to each other, causing the turmoil to escalate, and Shanghai's commerce and shipping have also suffered significant losses. The following is a more detailed report on the matter:</p>
<p>The foreign and Cantonese goods tax was changed to unified donation: On the 16th of this month, the Wenzhou Foreign and Cantonese Goods Tax Donation Bureau was ordered to merge into the Yongjia Unified Donation Bureau. After the bureau took over the foreign and Cantonese goods tax affairs, it announced that from the 17th, the Wenzhou Foreign and Cantonese Goods Donation would change its method, abolishing the old rules and changing to unified donation collection. The tax amount would be notified by the bureau to the foreign and Cantonese goods industry and merchants. Upon receiving the news, the foreign and Cantonese goods industry considered that the foreign and Cantonese goods tax was light, and the unified donation tax was heavy. Once the merchants agreed to pay, their burden would increase by 20% to 30%. As a result, the industry convened its members and unanimously opposed the change, requesting that the original system not be changed. As a result, the donation bureau also announced that the unified tax on non-foreign and Cantonese goods would be increased at the same time. The business community faced these two waves of unrest at the same time, leading to the boycott of strikes and other actions.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Strikes and boycotts by various industries: From the 17th, the allocation and export of goods in the foreign and Cantonese goods industry was the first to be suspended. On the 18th, because the tax bureau still insisted on the original proposal and refused to compromise, other industries also joined the strike unanimously. A group was organized to request exemption from the tax increase, fearing that one or two treacherous merchants would privately transport goods. Therefore, dockworkers and stevedores at each wharf were ordered to go on strike from the 17th, so that goods could not be loaded or unloaded. Transportation to and from Wenzhou was completely cut off.</p>
<p>The unrest is growing: From the 18th, commercial representatives held a meeting at the Chamber of Commerce for two days, hoping that the tax bureau would stop changing the unified donation and increasing the tax rate, but the tax bureau did not agree to the repeated requests. According to a telegram from Wenzhou yesterday, the situation of the businesses has gradually deteriorated, and the crisis of a city-wide strike is imminent.</p>
<p>Problems with Shanghai goods: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Guangji ship returned to Shanghai empty yesterday, using 35 tons of mud and sand to balance the ship. The problem of outbound goods after arriving in Shanghai has not yet been determined. Because foreign and Cantonese goods cannot be loaded, it is not certain whether other goods can be transported. The port workers have gone on strike, and if this problem is not resolved, it is feared that the goods cannot be unloaded. Therefore, whether to load outbound goods on the Guangji ship must wait for a telegram from Wenzhou. However, because the sailing is on schedule, the ship must leave.</p>
<p>Considerable losses to Shanghai ships: As the end of the year approaches, Wenzhou freight is rushing to load. Suddenly, a freight strike has occurred for many days. Three ships from Shanghai to Wenzhou, Guangji, Haiyan, and Yili, and four motor sailboats are currently returning to Shanghai empty due to lack of goods to load. The Guangji has lost more than 2,000 taels in freight by not transporting goods. The Haiyan ship will also return empty to Shanghai. The losses caused by the suspension of sailboats due to lack of goods to load are also huge. Shanghai merchants who have booked goods in Wenzhou waiting to be transported to Shanghai are even more anxious, and those who inquire at the shipping companies are coming in droves.</p>
<h3>Navy Implements Escort Service for Yangtze River Shipping</h3>
<p>Pirate activity is rampant along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Foreign merchants have already dispatched troops to protect their ships. Chinese river steamers, concerned about business and passenger safety, have also requested the government to send warships to patrol the area. This matter was previously reported in this newspaper, and further updates are reported as follows:</p>
<p>The British steamer Qizhou encountered danger. The Taikoo company's Yangtze River steamers Datong, Anqing, and others, en route from the Yangtze to Shanghai, encountered a pirate attack near Qizhou. The pirates first fired warning shots, then opened fire on the two steamers with six cannon shots. Two shells landed just outside the Anqing's outer barricade, a very close call. The British navy personnel on board returned fire with eight shells towards the pirates on the riverbank, and the pirates fled. Navigation remains extremely dangerous between Jiujiang and Huangzhou. Ships are reportedly navigating at night with their lights off.</p>
<p>The Navy Dispatches Warships for Escort Duty. Shanghai shipping merchants telegraphed headquarters requesting the dispatch of naval warships to protect merchant ships on the upper Yangtze bound for Yichang, Changsha, and Xiangtan. Headquarters has replied to Shanghai stating that two warships have been dispatched to the Chengling and Jianli area to suppress bandits and provide escort. Consequently, starting from the 20th, Yangtze steamers traveling from Hankou to Yichang, such as those belonging to China Merchants and Sanbei companies, are being escorted by the Chengsheng warship. However, pirate activity was again discovered near Jianli yesterday. Downbound merchant ships have stopped operating for fear of travel. After sending a telegram requesting assistance, the Ministry of the Navy has ordered the Jiangkun warship stationed in the Yuezhou area to urgently suppress the bandits and protect the ships to Hankou.</p>
<p>New Marker Buoys Installed in Xinzhou. The shoals and reefs near Huoyanshan, above Jiujiang, are constantly shifting. Navigation is especially dangerous during the low water season, and even slight carelessness can lead to grounding and accidents. Yesterday, the Jianghan Customs notified Shanghai shipping companies that marker buoys have been placed at the most dangerous shoals and reefs in Xinzhou, serving as navigational aids for upbound and downbound Yangtze steamers. Yangtze ships passing through the area must adhere to the warning lights, maintaining a distance of five English miles to avoid accidents in shallow waters. Indeed, these matters are perilous.</p>
<h3>The Congestion of Vessels Due to Shallow Waters in the Wusong River is Cleared</h3>
<p>Fan Hesheng, chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Rice Merchants Association, reported that at 3:00 PM on the 19th of this month, the narrowness of the Yujidun River combined with shallow autumn waters caused a sudden congestion of arriving ships. Four security guards from the association, along with Meng and Wang, the two patrol chiefs of the Sixth District, First Precinct of the Water Police, led the water police in efforts to clear the congestion. By 6:00 PM, normal passage had resumed. According to a report from the association's security guards, the situation has returned to normal.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Promotes the New System of Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Promulgation of Uniform Standards for Public Weights and Measures in the Municipality. The municipal government considers the promotion of the new system of weights and measures to be a crucial task. Shanghai, being a major port for trade, is under international scrutiny and should actively work to complete the standardization as scheduled. Eight articles of the proposed Shanghai Municipal Uniform Standards for Public Weights and Measures have been drafted, promulgated, and are now in effect. The original text of the articles are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Article 1: These regulations apply to all levels of central or local government agencies within the city of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Article 2: December 31, Year 19 (of the Republic), is declared as the date for the unification of public weights and measures within the city.</p>
<p>Article 3: From the date of promulgation of these regulations, all documents and records related to weights and measures in all agencies shall uniformly adhere to the standard system.</p>
<p>Article 4: From the date of promulgation of these regulations, all agencies shall immediately cease procuring equipment based on the old system. Existing equipment must be submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Weights and Measures for inspection and registration by November 30, Year 19. However, if there is an excessive amount of equipment that is inconvenient to move, the bureau may be notified to send personnel to conduct the inspection on-site.</p>
<p>Article 5: From the date of promulgation of these regulations, all public documents and other files submitted by the public to government agencies involving weights and measures shall uniformly adhere to the standard system.</p>
<p>Article 6: From the day after the declaration of unification, old system weights and measures equipment in all agencies shall be uniformly converted using the new system.</p>
<p>Article 7: These regulations may be amended at any time if there are any omissions.</p>
<p>Article 8: These regulations shall come into effect on the date of promulgation by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>He Dekui and Others Visit the Waterworks Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xi Ji, Pan Xulun, and He Dekui, the committee members from the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association responsible for reviewing the accounts of the Shanghai Municipal Council Waterworks Company, were invited by the manager of the waterworks to visit the plant in Yangshupu (mistakenly reported as an invitation to the Ratepayers Association to send representatives). However, as Pan and Yu were away from Shanghai on business, only He, accompanied by a few friends, visited the plant at 2:00 PM yesterday to broaden their knowledge. They were warmly received by Mr. Peisen and others, and toured various departments and workers' quarters. They departed at approximately 3:00 PM. The audit report is currently being jointly compiled by the three committee members and will be officially released upon completion.</p>
<h3>Shanghai County Party and Government Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government convened its 16th Party and Government Meeting at 10:00 AM yesterday. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, Construction Bureau Chief Wu Wenhua, County Party Department Tao Yishan, Public Security Bureau Shen Jinghua, Education Bureau Shi She, Finance Bureau Lu Dingxin, and more than ten others attended the meeting. The matters discussed included: (1) The County Government proposed that the County Party Department should promptly inform the County Government of the organization status of various people's organizations that have been submitted to the Party Department for approval. The result was that it was to be handled accordingly. (2) The County Construction Bureau proposed that the county-affiliated agencies were planning to establish public sports fields, but the funds were insufficient and how to make up for the shortfall was discussed. The result was that each agency would share the cost. (3) The County Education Bureau proposed that the list of staff of county-affiliated agencies be investigated and published in the County Government Gazette. The result was that it was to be handled accordingly.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Farmers Oppose the Sale of Japanese Autumn Cocoons in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Office of the Zhejiang Cocoon Industry Association Federation received a joint letter yesterday from farmers Zhang Tianshou and others from Jiaxing and other counties stating: We recently heard that a large quantity of Japanese autumn cocoons have arrived in Shanghai and are being peddled everywhere by brokers. Those who are ignorant are inevitably tempted by profit and forget righteousness. Although various sectors have loudly protested against the import of Japanese cocoons, the Shanghai Silk and Cocoon General Association, which is insane and out of control, has requested a reduction in import duties, resulting in a continuous influx into China. In this situation, the General Association is the sole entity that is controlling the lives of our farmers. We vow to devise appropriate countermeasures. On one hand, we urge your association to pay attention to this import of autumn cocoons. If any silk mills in Shanghai purchase these cocoons, we hope that you will secretly investigate and report to the inland farmers' associations. When those mills go inland to purchase cocoons next year, we will devise appropriate measures to resist them. We are anxiously awaiting orders. Signed, Zhang Tianshou, Wang Ziming, Qian Dasheng, Wang Qiang, Zhou Shaozhai, and 1,512 farmers from Jiaxing, Jiashan, Tongxiang, and Haiyan counties.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chinese Tobacco Factory Association Discusses Revising Cigarette Tax Regulations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Association convened an extraordinary general meeting of its members at 1:00 PM on the 20th to discuss the upcoming expiration of the current three-tiered tax pilot program. Mr. Wang Lide, a representative from the Party Department, attended to provide guidance. Members generally agreed that the current three-tiered tax system is very detrimental to Chinese merchants. Since the pilot program is expiring, the tax authorities should be requested to revise it. A delegation consisting of Lao Jingxiu, Bao Gengsheng, Shen Weiting, Yao Jixian, and Yu Zuqin was elected, with Shen Weiting designated as the convener, to consult with the Tax Bureau on revisions. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Pawn Industry Demands Revision of Labor Conditions</h3>
<p>The employer representatives have scheduled a meeting on the 28th to discuss the conditions of employment in the local pawn industry. The employees of the pawn industry, noting that the former compensation and working condition terms have not been conscientiously followed by the management side, have therefore passed a measure proposing 17 changes to the original terms, among which the most important is #2 (compensation): the terms of the positions will be uniformly: manager 20 yuan per ‘bao’ (package), package supervisor 19.50 yuan, gold decorations 19 yuan, head counter 18.50 yuan, second counter 18 yuan, second counter 17.50 yuan, book keeping 17 yuan, wrapping packages 16 yuan, clearing tickets 15 yuan, tag hanging 14 yuan, apprentice year 1 (13 yuan), apprentice year 2 (12 yuan), apprentice year 3 (11 yuan), apprentice year 4 (10 yuan), apprentice year 5 (9 yuan), apprentice year 6 (8 yuan). All administration 10 yuan. A double month’s pay is given in the twelfth month. #9 (layoff): if the pawn shop owner closes his shop due to unforeseen circumstances, the owners must disburse 300 yuan as layoff compensation. The compensation will be paid according to the existing market value, and before the settlement is resolved, the employers will disburse the double month’s pay. At one point, the employees negotiated directly with the management side, but due to the management representatives failing to show up to a negotiation meeting the meeting could not proceed. Therefore the employees are imploring a higher level of mediation. The Social Affairs Bureau, therefore, will summon on the 20th a conversation between management and labor to work together and attempt to reach a new consensus. It was noted that if after two weeks there is no fruit, then the bureau will intercede. The employer organizations (Special District Pawn Industry Association) and (Pawn Industry Association) have scheduled a meeting to take place on November 28th to discuss the situation.</p>
<h3>Aid Society for the Ding-Huang Tragedy Established by Various Sectors in Xuhui</h3>
<p>The Fifth Precinct of the Ninth District Sends a Telegram Seeking Assistance. Various sectors in Xuhui, in response to the tragedy caused by French sailors' drunken assault on our countrymen Ding Jiaqun and Huang Haiyou (details reported in the newspapers on the 14th), resulting in Ding Jiaqun being blinded, formed a support association. They believe that if no assistance is provided and no negotiations are conducted, it will be impossible to prevent future incidents and avenge this humiliation. Therefore, a support meeting was held at the Ninth District Party Headquarters at 2:00 PM on the 20th of this month.

He stated that if serious negotiations are not conducted, it will be impossible to prevent future incidents. All our compatriots should fight for justice to achieve ultimate victory. Liu Yunfang, chief of the Sixth District Second Station, then reported on the details of the incident. After that, the discussion focused on the measures to be taken: (1) It was decided that the name of the organization should be the Xuhui Aid Society for the Ding-Huang Tragedy.

<p>The Fifth Precinct of the Ninth District Sends a Telegram: To all newspapers, French organizations, and compatriots throughout the country: The French imperialist soldiers stationed in the occupied territories of Xujiahui have always been extremely vicious. There is no longer any regard for our Chinese people. Rape of women and drunken assaults causing injuries have occurred repeatedly. On the evening of the 8th of this month, at 9:00 PM, a group of French soldiers, while drunk, committed a heinous crime, injuring two people severely and three people slightly. Their lives are now in imminent danger. Hearing this news, we are filled with outrage. The French imperialists are treating human lives as worthless and disgracing our nation. It is unbearable. We earnestly hope that people from all walks of life will rise up together to protect our national rights and prevent aggression. This urgent telegram expresses our utmost indignation. Shanghai Special City Party Department, Fifth Precinct of the Ninth District.</p>

<h3>Two Medical Associations Approved to Establish Separately</h3>
<p>The Order of the Municipal Citizen Training Council. The Public Training Council of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department yesterday ordered the Chinese Medical Association and the Shenzhou Medical Association, stating: In order to comply with orders, this Council previously ordered the association to stop activity due to its strange naming convention and organization, and to merge into the Chinese Medicine Association. However, this association had a defense in which it claimed its organization was purely academic, purposed to research academia, ameliorate medicine, auxiliary administration, and enlightened sanitation. A review of the functions of both organizations show that they are very different. We implore for maintenance of the establishment and withdraw prior decisions. However, a review shows that the association has yet to fully receive permit procedures. Therefore the order will ask the association to comply with social organization rules and to confirm the associations’ name and purpose with the Council. We will also ask that they are confirmed to academic research, regarding the membership that guarantees the opening and settlement of business dispute, that they will be administered into the Chinese Medicine Association, and that the association will not intervene. Finally, we ask the association to focus on academy and to cease any other actions to influence other sectors that would affect the progress of the people.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Inspection of Imported Sugar</h3>

In addition to instructing the Commodity Inspection Bureaus of Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Guangzhou to conduct inspections on a regular basis, we are also sending this instruction for your information. We are enclosing a copy of the "Regulations for Inspection of Imported Sugar" for your reference. This letter is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Sugar Merchants Association.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Receives the Latest Disaster Report from Henan</h3>
<p>Chenliu, Tongxu, and Kaocheng people urgently await relief to alleviate their misery. The Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday received three telegrams from Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Relief Committee reporting the unbearable disaster situation in Chenliu, Tongxu, and Kaocheng counties. It is hoped that those who are concerned about relief efforts will take immediate action. (1) The Chinese Red Cross Society: According to a report from the War Disaster Investigation Committee of the subordinate association, Ren Huanxin, and the Chenliu County Magistrate Xu Futian, the war caused 7,000 people in the county to be killed, wounded, or displaced, with their whereabouts unknown. Over 4,300 large carts and 11,000 cattle and horses were lost. Levies were imposed seven times, totaling over 360,000 yuan. Grain and forage were requisitioned, valued at over 210,000 yuan. War trenches were dug, destroying 16,000 zhang of farmland, each over one zhang deep and wide. Countless houses were destroyed and possessions looted. Now that the war is over, the affected people have no clothes, food, or livestock. Their lives are in misery. We earnestly request your compassion and grant a large amount of grain and funds to provide relief. Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Relief Committee. (2) The Chinese Red Cross Society: According to a report from the Disaster Investigation Committee member Zhang Yuanzong, Tongxu County Magistrate Zhou Gu, the war caused 4,060 people in the county to be killed, wounded, or impressed into military service. Over 1,800 large carts and 6,200 cattle and horses were lost. Military levies were imposed five times, totaling over 47,000 yuan. Grain and forage were requisitioned, valued at approximately 158,000 yuan. War trenches destroyed 39,000 zhang of farmland, passing through 95 villages. Countless houses, trees, clothing, and property were damaged. Now that the war is over, the cries of distress fill the air, and people are desperately awaiting food. It is unbearable to hear. We earnestly request widespread relief. The county is located on a major thoroughfare, and the soil is barren. The wounds of war have not healed from the recent famine. Winter has arrived, and people have no clothes or food. If relief is not provided in advance, people will inevitably perish in ditches. We earnestly request that you quickly allocate grain and funds to provide relief, saving the survivors and rescuing them from disaster. Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Relief Committee. (3) The Chinese Red Cross Society: According to a report from the Disaster Investigation Committee members Wang Fangting and Chen Liangfu, Kaocheng County Magistrate Liang Gongyi, Kaocheng County was located on a key war front for over half a year. Over 10,800 people were impressed into military service, killed, wounded, or displaced, with their whereabouts unknown. Over 3,200 houses were burned down. Over 2,200 large carts and 6,600 horses were lost. Levies were imposed totaling over 20,020 yuan. Grain and forage were requisitioned, valued at over 50,040 yuan. Other property losses were estimated at over 100 yuan. War trenches crisscrossed the county, occupying farmland measuring 625,000 chi. These are only the measurable losses, and the indirect damage is incalculable. Winter has arrived, and displaced people are everywhere. We earnestly request relief to save the survivors. The county was located in a war zone that was gained and lost numerous times, causing severe damage to the people. The cold wind is biting, and the huddled figures along the road are pitiful. The hunger fire is burning, and those in the ditches are gasping their last breaths. Now that the war has ended, relief cannot be delayed. We earnestly request that you quickly allocate grain and funds to provide relief, showing humanity and extending the national life. Chairman Zhang Fang of the Henan Relief Committee.</p>

<h3>The Realizable Huangpu Iron Bridge</h3>
<p>Requiring 5 million in funds, it has been proposed that the government and businessmen cooperate to construct an iron bridge across the Huangpu River in order to develop Pudong's commerce. It is now believed that this plan, which has been in the works for over ten years, will be commenced. According to a reliable investigation by the New Voice Society, the construction of the iron bridge is now actively underway. The most important issue, funding, has now been agreed to by a patron, negating the need to raise funds. The reason why this plan is now deemed to be possible is because the founders Yao Jizhong and Zhao Lanting are both powerful figures. Furthermore, Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Qu Wenliu, Zhang Xiaoliang, Sheng Maoxiang, Yao Zirang, Yao Ziruo, Gu Xinyi, and Ye Huijun have also strongly endorsed the plan. The reasons and plan have been compiled below.</p>
<p>Reasons: Pudong's land area is greater than the combined areas of the British and French concessions. To the north, the Yangshupu River has depths of several fathoms, and ships of tens of thousands of tons can moor alongside the shore. Therefore, most imported heavy goods are stored in Pudong warehouses. If these goods are to be transported to Puxi, they must undergo the burden of barging, unloading, and loading. In the event of wind and waves, the situation becomes uncontrollable. This is the first reason for the urgent need for this bridge. Although travelers rely on ships to cross the Huangpu River, sudden storms and raging waves often render the boatmen unable to navigate, resulting in frequent capsizings. This is the second reason for the urgent need for this bridge. Pudong's low population density and lack of commercial development require improved transportation to stimulate growth. This is the third reason for the urgent need for this bridge. The basic plan is outlined below:</p>
<p>Funding: The width of the Huangpu River varies. It is proposed to build a steel, movable floating bridge at the narrowest point, south of the large wharf in the South City. The bridge will be approximately 1,800 English feet long. The cost of the bridge foundations, materials, and construction is estimated at 5 million national currency.</p>
<p>Construction: The bridge will be built in the latest European and American style, using pure steel. The form, width, height, and dimensions will be determined by a preparatory committee for the Huangpu Iron Bridge Construction Project, which will be established and staffed by expert engineers.</p>
<p>Nature: The bridge construction costs will be borne by merchants, with the government handling the project. The nature of the project is a public-private partnership.</p>
<p>Management: The government will appoint personnel to jointly organize a bridge management committee with the participating merchants to jointly manage the bridge.</p>
<p>Interest: The project will imitate the road maintenance fees of the Shanghai-Minhang bus company. After the bridge is completed, those who travel across the bridge between Puxi and Pudong will pay a copper coin construction fee to repay the principal and interest. After a certain number of years, the bridge will revert to the government. The above methods will be decided upon by the committee.</p>
<h3>Noteworthy: A Large Number of Pirates Come to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Foreign Ships Declare Martial Law, Delegations Request Protection. According to news from foreign shipping circles, a large number of pirates, who have been entrenched in the islands of Dapeng Bay near Hong Kong for a long time, suddenly sailed pirate ships near Shanghai. Foreign ships traveling outside Wusong are placed under martial law. Delegations were formed to request the Naval Ministry to dispatch ships for protection and to prevent incidents.</p>
<h3>Second Kidnapping of a Resident of Duck Nest Sandbar</h3>
<p>Bao Shan's wife, recently released by Shen's bandits, was kidnapped again last night by Pan's bandits. Ma Bao Shan and his wife, son of Ma Xing Fan, owner of the Ma Xing Fan fresh fish shop in Duck Nest Sandbar, East Town, Sanjiakou, Wusong, were kidnapped by Shen Guanxi's bandit gang this spring. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Later, Bao Shan's wife was rescued by her father-in-law and returned home. Bao Shan, however, remained in danger because Shen's bandits demanded too high a ransom. Unexpectedly, at around 8:00 last night, more than ten bandits from Pan Kaiwu's gang, dressed in military uniforms and carrying box cannons and handguns, stormed into the Ma residence to kidnap the owner. Fortunately, Ma Xing Fan heard the noise and, knowing they were bandits, escaped through the back door. The bandits searched the house thoroughly, and when they could not find the owner, they kidnapped Xing Fan's wife, his second son, Bao Shan's wife, the two eldest sons and daughter of Gui Fa, and Bao Shan's young daughter—three generations of mother-in-law, daughter-in-law, and grandchildren, a total of six people, young and old. When the bandits entered the house, they all held a handful of mud and smeared it on the faces of their victims to prevent them from recognizing their faces. Only Gui Fa's wife resisted strongly, angering the bandits, who beat her severely, causing serious injuries. She was not kidnapped, but her life hangs by a thread and may not be saved. A truly tragic event.</p>
<h3>### Actress Wang Yanfang Sues Her Teacher for Rape</h3>
<p>Learned acting, seduced, and raped, already gave birth to a baby girl. The teacher fled after being accused. The court issued an arrest warrant. The actress Wang Yanfang (real name Ai Lin), 19 years old, from Wuxi, recently had her mother, Wang Zhang, hire lawyer Fei Xizhen at the Special District Court to file a criminal complaint against her teacher, Zhou Wenhui (aka Zhou A'da), accusing him of rape. The complaint stated that the plaintiff had apprenticed to Zhou in July of the 16th year of the Republic to study opera. From October of the 17th year, she performed with the defendant in Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiading, and other places. The defendant, with malicious intent, on the 10th day of the first month of the 18th year of the Republic, when the plaintiff went to Zhou's place for training, lured her into a secret room and used deception and force to rape her, resulting in pregnancy. The plaintiff initially concealed the truth from her mother, but when she went into labor and her abdomen swelled, her mother repeatedly questioned her, forcing her to reveal the details of the rape. She intended to file a complaint immediately, but on the 12th day of the first month of this year, she gave birth to a girl and was physically weak. Fortunately, her parents hired famous doctors to treat her. Now that she has recovered, she is filing a lawsuit, believing that the defendant's rape has ruined her reputation for life, which she cannot bear. According to the law, the defendant has committed the crime of Article 257 of the Criminal Law and should be arrested and severely punished. In addition, she is filing a civil lawsuit, requesting that the court order him to compensate her for the loss of reputation in the amount of 30,000 silver dollars. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Feng Shide opened the court and summoned the defendant, Zhou Wenhui, to appear. Zhou Wenhui did not appear. His mother, Zhou Ye, testified that on December 18th of last year, her son returned from performing in Wuxi with the plaintiff and stayed at the plaintiff's home and never returned home. This time, when the court summoned him, a friend told him that he would be arrested and punished, so he left again and his whereabouts are unknown. The plaintiff, Wang Yanfang, stated that the defendant did not live at her home. Since the plaintiff's lawyer could not summon the defendant to appear in court for questioning, Judge Feng adjourned the case until the defendant is arrested and questioned again.</p>
<h3>Poisonous Substances Found in White Wax</h3>
<p>After chemical analysis, it was determined to be Heroin. The Da Mei Evening News reports that on the 10th of this month, customs officials seized over 300 pounds of heroin from goods shipped to Shanghai on the Italian ship Cracovia. Subsequently, they became suspicious of a large shipment of white wax, about a ton, also transported on the ship. They took wax samples for chemical analysis and discovered that it contained over 30% pure heroin. The entire shipment of white wax was taken to customs for refining, yielding over 600 pounds of high-quality heroin. Combined with the heroin previously seized from dried fruit, the total amount is no less than 1,000 pounds. At the Shanghai wholesale price of 70 yuan per ounce, the total value reaches a staggering 1.12 million yuan, truly an unprecedented seizure. It is noted that in the past two weeks, the Jianghai Customs has seized large quantities of narcotics three times. The first time, 190 pounds of heroin were seized from the Italian ship Dirana, which was shipped from Constantinople and concealed in raisins. The shipment on the Cracovia was the second time. The third time was yesterday, when 100 cases of opium were discovered in goods shipped on the German ship Croso, worth 1 million yuan. This opium is currently sealed in the Customs Administration because it was declared for shipment to Dalian, and there may be dealings with the Japanese authorities. However, according to customs officials, the opium was not pre-booked or declared for transit in Shanghai, so the Shanghai Customs has the right to confiscate it.</p>
<h3>The Soon-to-Be-Established Xiao Case Support Association</h3>
<p>Various organizations are sending letters and telegrams, launching initiatives one after another. Various circles in Xiamen have issued a support statement for the Xiao case. All circles in Shanghai are continuing their efforts to assist in the Xiao case. The Overseas Chinese Federation is seeking support from all circles to establish a Xiao case support association. As of yesterday, a large number of organizations have responded with letters of approval. The Xiamen Xiao case support association also sent a telegram reporting the incident of the Marine Seamen's Union inspector being stopped by the Xiamen Garrison Commander Lin Guogeng from conducting the Xiao case movement, as well as an open letter to the national public. Excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>Organizations Supporting the Support Association (1) The Lawyers Association replied in a letter stating that Ms. Xiao Xin'an was insulted and that it was proposed to convene a conference of all circles to support Xiao. The letter requested assistance from the association, which has been acknowledged. The association plans to hold a meeting to discuss this matter. Please send a letter informing us of the date of the meeting. Standing Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association (2) The Quanzhou Zhangzhou Association replied in a letter stating that the news that Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a female teacher from our country, was sexually assaulted in the South Seas by the Dutch first and second officers of the Java Company's ship Tjibadak has spread. The world is outraged. It is now proposed to jointly convene a conference of all circles to discuss supporting Xiao, seeking redress, and alleviating the suffering of overseas Chinese in the Dutch colonies. We are deeply saddened and angered by the news of the Xiao case and the barbarity of the Dutch. The association deeply approves the convening of a conference of all circles to discuss methods of assistance. The Association should participate and carry out the campaign. (3) The Labor University replied in a letter stating that it has read the letter with great concern. All Chinese people are outraged by the insult to Ms. Xiao. The university expresses its deep approval of the proposal to convene a conference of all circles to discuss supporting Xiao, seeking redress, and alleviating the suffering of overseas Chinese in the Dutch colonies.</p>
<p>Marine Seamen Supporting Xiao Expelled from Xiamen The Overseas Chinese Federation on Parker Road, Shanghai, informs all circles. The association has recently been prevented from proceeding by Commander Lin Guogeng, who has forced the expulsion of Comrade Wang Rong, the Marine Seamen's Union inspector who was most active in guiding the association. Comrade Wang left Xiamen today on the Hai Cheng ship. Please announce this to the whole country and seek assistance, and request that the Central Government quickly remove Lin Guogeng, who is undermining the patriotic movement of the people. The association is still working hard and striving. The Xiamen Xiao Case Support Association humbly requests your attention.</p>
<p>An Open Letter from All Circles in Xiamen to the People of the Countrymen! This time, the first officer, Lan Anqi, and second officer, Lei Yama Kai, of the Java Company's Tjibadak ship sexually assaulted Ms. Xiao Xin'an of our country. The facts have been detailed in Ms. Xiao's memoir, "A Weak Woman's Perilous Encounter." This is an unprecedented event in history and a rare humiliation in the world. How can we let it go so easily? Imperialists have always used various cruel methods to bully our weak nation, such as banning our party's books, disbanding party headquarters in the Dutch colonies, expelling our party members, increasing immigration taxes for Chinese, and restricting our Tongshan ships from sailing in the Dutch colonies. Insults such as treating our people the same as the native aborigines are all proof. Unexpectedly, this time the imperialists have gone even further, using their first and second officers, like beasts, to ravage our country's women. Xiao Xin'an is a holy female teacher, and the ship is a solemn place. How can the first and second officers dare to indulge in bestial desires openly on the ship in broad daylight? It is not only a disgrace to China's national prestige but also a shame to the world. Can these hateful, disgusting, and ugly first and second officers be dismissed? Compatriots, Ms. Xiao was insulted by the first and second officers. Fortunately, Ms. Xiao is a member of the education community and was not afraid to reveal the facts, allowing us to understand. Otherwise, those who swallow their anger and do not speak out will not know the fate of all the women who are subsequently insulted by these beasts. Therefore, our struggle this time is to seek redress for women around the world, not just to fight for the reputation of Ms. Xiao alone. The bell of blood has rung. Now the people of the country are unwilling to be insulted. Everyone is clenching their teeth and clenching their fists, resolutely boycotting the Dutch ships of the Java Shipping Company. Our various circles in Xiamen have also organized a Xiao Support Committee to stand on the same front with the people of the country, refusing to ship goods on Dutch ships from the 7th of this month. It goes without saying that all the people of Xiamen are united and share the same hatred of the enemy, severing economic ties with Dutch imperialists, which also shows that our national spirit has not died. Now that the Xiao case has not been resolved, we cannot relax the boycott for a day. The people of the country should keep this firmly in mind in order to achieve victory in the Xiao case. Now the first and second officers of the Tjibadak are still at large. The Java Shipping Company is still laughing at us, saying that Xiao Xin'an has a mental illness and a face full of pockmarks. The day when they repent is still far away. If the people of the country rise up unanimously and fight them to the death, then the day of victory is also far away. In addition to boycotting the ship, we must also urge our government to make the following serious demands to the company: (1) Severely punish the first officer, Lan Anqi, and second officer, Lei Yama Kai, of the Tjibadak. (2) Compensate Ms. Xiao Xin'an for the loss of her reputation. (3) The Dutch government should officially apologize to our country. (4) Ensure that similar incidents will not occur in the future.</p>
<h3>Declarations by Various Organizations Regarding the Xin Dingxiang Case</h3>
<p>Xin Dingxiang from Ningbo was pushed into the Huangpu River by two French sailors, resulting in a tragic case. The people of the country are all indignant. Various labor unions in Pudong and the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union issued declarations on the tragic Xin Dingxiang case yesterday. Excerpts are recorded below:</p>
<p>To the Public of All Countries by Pudong Labor Unions: The gunboat policy of the imperialists seizes our territory, infringes on our navigation rights, and slaughters our people like chickens and dogs. The negotiations regarding Song Derong have just been completed, and the tragic case of Xin Dingxiang has occurred again. The surging Huangpu River mourns this national tragedy. The precarious China faces an increasingly urgent crisis. There is no justice in the world, and what diplomacy is there for weak countries? Is it possible to protect the country and ensure survival by delaying any further? Punishing the perpetrators and providing compensation is only temporary security. The elimination of unequal treaties is the only way to eliminate harm permanently. It depends on the people of the country rising up together to urge the government to implement revolutionary diplomacy, take back the concessions, abolish consular jurisdiction, and withdraw warships in China. If we do not get to the root of the problem, please learn from the past. The unions and other organizations are raising their voices with empty words, which will not help. We are vowing to endure hardship and face death. We are tearfully presenting our words, unable to express our sorrow and anger in full. This is a declaration from the Pudong British American Tobacco Factory Union, Pudong Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Union, Pudong Electric Factory Union, Pudong Stevedores Union, Pudong Shipbuilding Workers Union, and Pudong Porter Union.</p>
<p>To The Marine Seamen's Union: The French imperialists, relying on their gunboat policy, have long acted with impunity in our country's territory, treating our country as if it were nothing. The case of Xin Dingxiang, a sampan operator, being beaten and pushed into the Huangpu River by sailors from the French warship Volte, resulting in his tragic death, is a particularly obvious example. According to reports, the sailors hailed the sampan to return to the ship. When they arrived, the sailors refused to pay the sampan fare. When Xin Dingxiang asked for payment, the sailors beat him and pushed him into the Huangpu River, resulting in his drowning. The news of his tragic death has deeply angered people from all walks of life. All circles have organized a Xin Case Support Association and telegraphed the government to lodge serious protests. Recently, the French Consul General in Shanghai, Gan Glanglin, replied to the municipal government, stating that the perpetrators have been severely punished by the French naval authorities. However, the reply does not announce the names of the sailors or state according to what regulations they were punished. It is merely an empty statement to deceive our people. The French imperialists' contempt for the lives and rights of our people is escalating. If we do not carry out strict negotiations, our people will suffer irreparably. In addition to the Support Association submitting a petition to the government to lodge a serious protest, demanding that the perpetrators be punished according to the law, that compensation be paid, and that guarantees be given that no more brutal and barbaric acts will occur, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union, on behalf of its 800,000 members, stands behind the protest. We hope that people from all walks of life will rise up together to strive for the implementation of national strength. This is a declaration from the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Ship Collides with Three Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>The Norwegian merchant ship DRILNON, entering the port of Shanghai at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday, was sailing towards the Dongjiadu wharf in southern Shanghai when it attempted to turn north in the Huangpu River. Due to the strong ebb tide, the ship was moving too fast to turn in time and veered towards the shore. There were several Ningbo fishing boats moored there, about a hundred feet from the shore, and they could not raise their anchors in time to avoid the collision. The ship continued to press forward, completely damaging the starboard side and stern of the Xin Tai Long fishing boat. It also broke three anchor chains. The Jin Jian Chang fishing boat, which was next to the Xin Tai Long, had several planks damaged. At this point, the ship urgently dropped anchor to stop its advance, but the stern continued to swing inward, hitting the bow of the Xin Yu Ting fishing boat, which was behind the first two boats. At this point, the sailors managed to stop the ship from moving further inward. However, the losses suffered by the fishing boats were already considerable. It is reported that the three broken anchor chains alone are worth about 3,000 taels of silver, not including the damage to the boats themselves. Afterwards, the three boat owners, Tong Shunchang, Weng Xiaogen, and Wu A'yuan, filed a complaint with the Marine Police Station.</p>

<h3>Municipal Ferry Launched Yesterday</h3>
<p>To be completed and operational at the beginning of next year. The Municipal Public Utility Bureau, acting on the orders of the Municipal Government, is actively preparing two cross-river ferry services between Dongmen Road of the 16th Ward and Dongchang Road of the Laiyi Ferry, and between Dinghai Bridge and Qingning Temple. The three cross-river ferries needed were contracted to be built by the He Xing Machine Manufacturing Factory. All of the hulls have been completed and were launched yesterday (the 21st) at 2:00 PM. Attendees included Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Section Chiefs Luo Jingyou and Zhu Hao, Public Security Bureau Section Chief Huang Guangdou, Second District Chief Wang, City Bank Manager Gu Yinong, Supervisor and Ship Inspector Cao Shoulian, Bureau Chief Huang Boqiao, Section Chief Tan Boying, and Chief Technician Cao Shengzhi, all of whom boarded the deck of the new No. 4 ferry, which was anchored in the river, and watched as the whistle blew.</p>

<p>The crowd worked together to push the ship off the skids. With a loud crash and a splash of water, the attendees expressed their satisfaction. The dimensions of the ships are: length 56 feet, width 15 feet, height 5 feet, draft when empty 2 feet 6 inches. Each ship can carry about 120 people. The cost of each ship is 21,500 silver dollars, for a total of 64,500 silver dollars for the three ships. All of them will be completed and operational at the beginning of next year. After the launching, He Xing Factory Manager Qian Jinhua invited the attendees to the factory for tea. During the tea party, Bureau Chief Huang stated that the Municipal Government is launching this cross-river ferry service to facilitate travel across the Huangpu River and to promote the development of Pudong, as well as to adjust the population density between Puxi and Pudong. The rapid completion of this project is due to the economic assistance from the City Bank, the efforts of the He Xing Factory in construction, and the diligent supervision of the ship inspector.</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Dog Racing Ban</h3>
<p>Results of several consultations are unknown.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Municipal Council previously intended to prohibit commercialized gambling in the Public Concession. After a meeting of the Council, many days have passed without the announcement of a concrete policy. Therefore, foreign and other taxpayers are complaining. Yesterday (the 19th), a representative of the Shanghai Times interviewed several well-known foreign taxpayers in Shanghai. They all said that the Municipal Council should immediately state its opinion on this matter. The Commissioner of Police has said that the prevalence of commercialized gambling in Shanghai is directly related to crime in the Concession. If the Municipal Council is considering a ban, it should clearly inform the public. However, it remains silent, which is not the behavior of a good government and is not treating taxpayers fairly. It is rumored that the ban on dog racing must wait for the British Minister Sir Lampson to arrive in Shanghai and fully consider the status of the dog racing tracks set up by the British before a resolution can be reached. Yesterday afternoon, when Municipal Council officials were asked about this, they remained silent. It is also rumored that one of the main difficulties in dealing with dog racing is that horse racing with betting on horse tickets has been in place for a long time, and banning dog racing will harm horse racing. However, it was confirmed yesterday that representatives of the Municipal Council have met with the heads of the dog racing tracks several times. The reasons for the meetings and the results of the consultations are unknown.</p>
<h3>Dongxiang Town Outside Wusong Mouth Suddenly Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Dongxiang Town, a coastal town outside Wusong Mouth, was attacked by six bandit ships at around 4:00 AM the day before yesterday. Over 200 bandits, led by the chief bandit Cai Zhennan, landed and looted shops and homes, setting them on fire. The provincial security team stationed nearby rushed to intercept the bandits. The bandits were in the process of boarding their ships when a fierce battle broke out. Gunfire erupted, and the bandits retreated while fighting. As a result, the bandit leader Cai Zhennan was captured on the spot, and a fake bandit battalion commander named Yu Tingxiu was killed. The remaining bandits escaped onto their ships and sailed away. The No. 18 Water Police Team is now pursuing them on the sea. The exact amount of losses in the town is unknown. Over 80 houses were set on fire by the bandits.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of Foremen Accused of Seducing a Female Teacher</h3>
<p>The foreman was declared innocent. The female teacher of Wu Shi Primary School, Ni Xiuzhen, accused Zhu Haisheng, a foreman at the Rui Rong Iron Factory, of seduction in the Special District Court. Judge Cheng Shangfeng summoned him for questioning several times and ordered Zhu to post a 1,000-yuan bail. The verdict was announced yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, the plaintiff Ni Xiuzhen arrived with her mother. Shortly after, Judge Cheng took his seat. The defendant Zhu Haisheng did not appear due to illness. His lawyer, Ye FuKang, appeared on his behalf. Judge Cheng announced in court that Zhu Haisheng was not guilty. The plaintiff's claim for civil damages was rejected. The plaintiff has ten days to appeal the verdict.</p>
<h3>Seducing a Woman and Forcing Her into Prostitution</h3>
<p>A'er and A'mao were sentenced separately. Chen A'er from Jiangbei seduced and defiled Hu Hongdi, a 17-year-old girl from Jiangwan, and then had his wife, Chen A'mao, force her into prostitution. Hongdi wrote to her brother in Shanghai, who reported the case to the police. A'mao was arrested and brought to the Special District Court for questioning and punishment. The police arrested Chen A'er yesterday. However, Hongdi has returned to Jiangwan and did not appear in court to testify. Judge Feng questioned Chen A'er, who said that A'mao was originally a private prostitute and that he had known her for a short time. Hongdi also knew her and it was not him who brought her to A'mao's place to work as a prostitute. He also denied raping Hongdi. The court ordered A'mao to be brought in for questioning. She testified that she was married to A'er and that Hongdi was given to her by A'er and forced to work as a prostitute. After investigating the facts, Judge Feng immediately sentenced Chen A'er to one year and six months of imprisonment. Chen A'mao was also sent to the women's prison to serve her sentence.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing in the Wang Hanlun Cigarette Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The movie star Wang Hanlun previously hired lawyer Lan Xuzhang to represent her in a civil lawsuit in the French court against Zhang Xinliang, manager of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company, for manufacturing Wang Hanlun brand cigarettes in Tianjin without her consent, deliberately damaging her reputation, and requesting compensation for damages. The case continued yesterday. The defendant's lawyer stated that in 1925, Chen Luhao, manager of the Jianhua Company, invited the plaintiff to perform films and dances in Siam. He obtained the plaintiff's consent to have the Fuxin Tobacco Company in Shanghai produce two types of cigarettes, Wang Hanlun brand and San Wei brand, to be given away to viewers to promote the show. Later, Wang Hanlun left the area, so the Jianhua Company did not take the goods. The Fuxin Company declared liquidation and sold all its assets and goods, including Wang Hanlun cigarettes, to the Great Southeast Tobacco Company. This was advertised in the newspaper. The Great Southeast Company then transported these cigarettes to Tianjin and entrusted the Tongyichang Tobacco Paper Shop to sell them on its behalf. The cigarettes were not manufactured by the defendant company. The plaintiff should file a lawsuit against the Jianhua Company. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant had transported the cigarettes to Tianjin for sale, and the defendant company had declared them to the Hebei Cigarette Unified Donation Bureau, as evidenced by a letter. Judge Gong Cheng ordered further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Maid Falls and Dies</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency translates: Zhu Yuanfu, from Pudong, who resides at No. 23 Yuncheng Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, hired Xue Zhang, a rural woman from Suzhou (44 years old), as a maid for many years. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, at 4:30 PM, Zhang fell down the stairs and injured her head, hands, and feet. On the 19th, Zhu took Zhang to Renji Hospital, but she died yesterday morning due to her injuries. The hospital notified the police station, which took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy. The police chief sent detectives to summon Zhu's wife, Cheng (the employer), to the station to inquire about the circumstances of the fall. She was released after questioning and told to wait for today's autopsy report.</p>
<h3>Tea Room Attendant at Inn Dies a Tragic Death</h3>
<p>Accompanied guest to school, unexpectedly never returned. The New China Hotel at No. 10 Hongyun Lane, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, suddenly had a young guest the night before last. The guest, claiming to be a student named Li Lulu, wearing a suit, booked Room 22 on the second floor. The next evening, because he had no room money, the manager of the hotel asked the tea room attendant to go with him to the Xiaonanmen school to collect it. The tea room attendant, Song Xiankang, went with him. Unexpectedly, he never returned. After three days of searching, there was no trace. While everyone was speculating, the hotel suddenly received an anonymous letter. The wording in the letter sounded like it was from Li Lulu, saying that the tea room attendant had been lost on the way, but the room money would be sent soon. The manager, Mr. Wang, felt even more surprised. He read the news in this newspaper (i.e., Wednesday, the 19th) and found a news item about a streetcar passenger who died. It stated that at 9:00 PM the night before last, a No. 3 streetcar of the China Merchants Electric Company was passing the entrance of the Cangji School on Qiaojia Road, Zhonghua Road, in the South City when a passenger fell from the streetcar and died. He was an unknown person. After reading it, he remembered that the time and details matched, so he went to the local police station to inquire. It was confirmed that the deceased was the tea room attendant. He immediately went to the Shanghai Local Court to claim the body and arrange for the funeral and telegraphed his family to come to Shanghai to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Concubine of Xue Baorun Files Lawsuit for Division of Inheritance</h3>
<p>The late Xue Baorun, known as Ti Quan, a famous pigment magnate, died of illness on July 2 of the lunar calendar this year. He left behind a wife, a concubine, four sons, and two daughters, as well as property worth more than 1 million gold. The concubine, Xue Gu Qiaolin, also known as Xiao A'jin, was on bad terms with the wife, Sun, and rented a small house on Baker Road six years ago. After a robbery, she moved to the Shanghai English School building on Avenue Edward VII. A few months before Xue's death, she moved to No. 202 Dihua Lane, Avenue Joffre. Xue Gu Qiaolin gave birth to a daughter on July 18 last year. Xue loved the daughter as the apple of his eye and named her Bao Bao Xue. Since the robbery at the Baker Road residence, Xue no longer kept cash at home. Therefore, Xue Gu Qiaolin and her daughter Bao Bao were struggling to make ends meet. Xue's wife and sons, Xue Gansheng and others, refused to give her any of the property. This was heard by her relatives Chen Renhe, Zhang Binghui, and Xu Yabo, who believed that Xue Gansheng and others were withholding the property unfairly. They hired Zheng Yuxiu, Yuan Xilian, Yan Yinwu, and other lawyers to file a lawsuit in the French court, requesting that the court investigate the inheritance of Xue Baorun and divide it equally among the children according to their shares. It is said that Xue Gu Qiaolin and her daughter should receive at least 2 million gold.</p>
<h3>Traveler Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>A guest suddenly arrived at the Xin Xin Hotel at No. 158 Fuzhou Road, which is where Renji Hospital is located, at 1:00 PM on the 16th of this month and asked for a room to rest. At that time, he instructed the tea servant Zhang Muqian to wake him up at 9:00 AM the next morning. Zhang agreed and left. The next morning, at 9:00 AM, when he knocked on the guest's door, there was no sound. So he broke the door and entered, seeing that the guest's face had turned pale and realizing something was wrong. He touched him and found him still warm, and reported it to the General Patrol Station, which ordered detectives to investigate. The guest had written the name Zhang Shaobo, age 26, on the water card. Zhang was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, where a doctor examined him and found that Zhang had taken a deep dose of tranquilizer and was severely poisoned. He died the day before yesterday. The body was taken to the autopsy office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the Special District Local Court, along with a forensic doctor, arrived at the office to examine the body and confirmed that the death was indeed a suicide by poisoning and that there was no other cause. He ascended to his official position and questioned the Western constable and witness Zhang Muqian. Because no family members of the deceased were found, he ordered Pushen Shanzhuang to provide a coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Reconstruction of Prematurely Terminated Leased Property</h3>
<p>Gu Yunshan of the Wanguo Laundry Company yesterday hired a lawyer to sue in the French Concession Court, stating that the plaintiff had leased a house at No. 505 Xiafei Road from the Weisheng Company in the 16th year of the Republic of China, with a contract period of eight years. Only three years have passed, but the landlord Yu Taixiang suddenly ordered them to move out to rebuild the house. He argued that since the contract was signed first, how could they break the agreement later? He requested compensation for the loss of five years, totaling more than 4,000 yuan, plus moving expenses of 500 yuan, which should be borne by the two defendants. The Weisheng Company also had a lawyer argue on its behalf, stating that the Weisheng Company had leased the house from Yu Taixiang, also with a contract for more than ten years. The reason for the demolition was that the plaintiff had leased the rooftop to an advertising company, which put up a huge billboard that was damaged by wind and rain, causing the house to be severely damaged. Therefore, the main landlord had to demolish and rebuild, which was the plaintiff's own fault. They requested that the case be dismissed and that a counterclaim be allowed. Yu Taixiang also had a lawyer argue on his behalf. Judge Gong Chen ordered that the matter be investigated and verified before a decision was made.</p>
<h3>Sculptor Yue Lun Returns from France</h3>
<p>Mr. Yue Lun went to the Lyon Academy of Fine Arts in France in the 12th year of the Republic of China to study sculpture. After five years, he transferred to the Paris Research Institute to study under the famous French sculptors Bourdelle and Bernard, who both praised him highly, saying that his work surpassed all his students and that he had produced unprecedented works. He won the highest honor award at the Salon, which was widely reported in the Paris newspapers, which considered him a courageous figure in the art world who opened a new chapter in the exhibition for Orientals and brought glory to our country. His wife, Cécile, the beloved daughter of the French Marquis de Vains, is also a prominent figure in the art world. They both returned home yesterday on a French postal ship, bringing many works that will be publicly exhibited to the people of the country.</p>
<h3>An Appeal for Relief from the Shaanxi Disaster</h3>
<p>Shaanxi Province has suffered from drought and locust plagues for many years, compounded by the devastation of soldiers and bandits, leading to displacement and destitution. This year, it was hoped that the autumn harvest would provide some relief, but the disaster was severe, and various counties have again suffered from the ravages of locusts. The grain is not ripe, and epidemics continue to occur. The China Jisheng Association has repeatedly received urgent telegrams from Zhu Zilao and the Chang'an Jisheng Branch, warning that if urgent relief is not provided immediately, people will inevitably starve to death on the roads in the cold weather. The disaster situation will be even worse than before. It is necessary to quickly open porridge kitchens to save lives, otherwise the remaining survivors of the previous disasters will still fill the ravines. A huge amount of money is needed to provide porridge and aid. It is hoped that benevolent people will generously donate to save the lives of millions of people who are stretching their necks waiting for help. The telegram also invited Mr. Zhang Xianqing of the association to go to handle the matter. After receiving the telegram, the association, having already spent tens of thousands of yuan on Shaanxi disaster relief, found it difficult to raise more funds and only managed to send 3,000 yuan to the Chang'an Jisheng Branch on the 11th through Fuyuan Zhuang and Juyuan Deji in this city. This small amount is only a token gesture, as the severity of the Shaanxi disaster cannot be addressed without a large sum of money. It is hoped that benevolent people will consider donating generously so that even small contributions can help save lives.</p>

<h3>Almond Cookies at the Hangzhou-Huzhou Exhibition</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province is the richest in resources among all provinces and spares no effort in promoting domestic goods. The West Lake Exposition last year achieved satisfactory results. The initiation of the Hangzhou and Huzhou exhibitions this time further demonstrates Zhejiang Province's efforts to revitalize industry. The Shuangzhe brand almond cookies (also known as almond brandy) produced by Yihe Yuan at the intersection of Huade Road and Huasheng Road in Shanghai are free of poisonous substances such as fire wine and wood alcohol, and have the functions of appetizing, quenching thirst, preventing epidemics, protecting against the cold, and nourishing blood and strengthening the body. It can be compared to the expensive brandy from Europe and America, while the local selling price of almond cookies in this city is only 50 cents per large bottle. The Hangzhou and Huzhou exhibitions considered it necessary to promote it, so they entrusted the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to transport it there. Mr. Ling Yongde, the owner of Yihe Yuan, entrusted Mr. Chen Guohua, the general manager of Hangzhou, to represent him at the exhibition. A large batch was also rushed over yesterday. It is reported that almond cookies are sold in this city at Wing On, Sincere, Guanshengyuan, Tianfu, Sanyang, etc., and recently Zhang Chongxin Sauce Garden in the central market of Shilu has also been added.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, In this morning's edition of your newspaper, a news item about our association's dormitory stated that "the dormitory department also moved at the same time," which is not true. The dormitory department of our association is still at its original location on De Si Road. Only the office was moved to Nanjing Road, so the dormitory can use the former office as a dormitory. We hope that you will correct this today. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Shanghai YWCA, November 21st.</p>
