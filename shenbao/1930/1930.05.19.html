<p>時評</p>
<h3>歐洲合衆國</h3>
<p>白里安去秋在國聨大會。發起組設歐洲合衆國時。即令委員會詳細研究以備下屆國聨開會時提出。當時歐人士震於合衆國名詞之廣大。而莫識其意義所在。於是議論紛紛。有人以爲白之主張。即十年前科登荷甫凱勒吉伯爵所倡汎歐羅巴運動之主張。世界日趨大同。必能促進各大洲汎歐汎美汎亞等聨邦之實現。又有人以爲此歐洲合衆國之名稱。有與美洲合衆國對待之意。不能不聨想及於與美相類之聨邦政治。然而大多數人。則以爲白之主張。目光祇注射於歐洲經濟之一點。鑒於美國經濟勢力之發展。歐洲各國。不能不圖所以自存。前此一度倡歐洲經濟同盟。復一度舉行關稅休戰會議。意皆在一新歐洲經濟之壁壘。現在之所謂合衆國。大抵仍欲繼續以前之工作。僅攺易其名稱而巳耳。乃不謂今日一讀其發表之節略。以歐洲各國結成一體爲原則。并明言經濟問題次於政治。驟視之誠如美聨所謂有組織歐洲大聨邦之意。然以吾人觀之。白氏之意。亦仍不過欲組織一種團體如同盟之類。以便易於合作耳。且其意亦仍注重於經濟。不過欲整理經。濟不得不牽涉政治。故以政治爲先耳。不然。若眞欲組設正式聨邦。則窒礙正多。一爲歐洲各國之有殖与地者。是否亦列入範圍之内。一爲向有主權之國家。將降爲聨邦中之一員一任中央會議之裁决。則各國能否同情。此二問題先難解决。其他更勿論矣今白氏聲明不礙及聨盟各國之絶對主權與政治獨立。則可以證明其非正式聨邦矣。蓋若組設正式聨。邦則决不能無礙於各國之主權與獨立也。惟即非組設正式聨邦。亦甚多困難。以行政方面論。與國際聨盟。不能無衝突之處以經濟方面論。則關稅會議之成績。巳彰彰可見。在此目前狀態之下。意見恐更難一致。成功亦正難言矣。</p>

<h3>一得之言秋水</h3>
<p>女子們愛男子頭上任何一根頭髮。可是在他的外衣襟上發現的頭髮。伊决計不會愛的。</p>
<p>男子們可以很鎭定地又很勇敢地對付舉槍待發的暴徒。可是一聞任何女子對他冷笑。他就會像嚇謊的麋鹿一般逃去哩。</p>
<p>女人們的愛情是不死的。除非等到伊巳倦於饒恕伊的男子。而想把他忘懷了的時候。</p>
<p>操了幾年家政以後的女子。虚言妄誓可以說是伊的第二天性。。。。假使伊不隱瞞了伊所浪費的總數給伊貧困的丈夫知道。就會在伊有錢的丈夫面前假說幾筆巳經儲蓄了的欵項。</p>
<p>求愛是一種奇怪的藝術。年未二十的少年。顯然可以見着他有這種自然天才。而許多飽經世故的人們。却終於不曾得到一點求愛的皮毛</p>
<p>春天之對於未婚的男子。好像是一種新的興奮的藥劑。是一種新的羅曼史的資料。可是對於巳婚的男子。不過是一種預防蒼蠅換掛窗簾的時機羅了。</p>
<p>妒忌是一個放大鏡。妒的婦人可以二加二變成了二十四。</p>

<h3>西貢一瞥·許·土·騏</h3>
<p>西貢位于香港與新加坡之間。爲越南巨埠。其地本爲我國舊壤。自秦漢以來。設置郡縣。遣使朝貢。無間歲月。迄至清代。中法釁起。淪爲屬地。愚首次觀光。發生無限感觸。紀其大略。以告國人。經湄公河迤邐十九灣。始達堤岸。地當熱帶。氣候綦炎。愚在滬登輪。御夾衣而不勝其寒。至此乃揮汗如雨。一週之隔。差至三月。全年分乾雨兩季。自十一月至四月。幾不降雨。乾燥異常。自五月至十月。雨量甚多。易於耕種。土地肥沃。産米極饒。土人習慣。單衣赤足。無殊男女。因氣候關係。習於懶惰。怠於動作。大好韶光。大都虚耗於睡鄉之中覆亡原因。其在茲乎。</p>
<p>法人以越南爲遠東海防重要之地。慘淡經營。積極努力。其間橋梁建築。井井有條。林木蓊蔚。鐵軌縱横。此種園林化之市街。足以代表法人愛好藝術之精神。與英人經營香港。異曲同工。各趨所尙。回顧中土。能毌槪然。</p>
<p>越南政府。待遇華僑。至爲苛刻。入境除納十五元爲進口稅外。尙須年繳人頭稅五十元。經營商業。又有所謂牌稅者。横徵暴歛。無所不用其極。最近頒佈取締華商條例。自本年五月一日起。凡年納牌稅五百元以上者。一律攺用法文簿記。此種高壓手段之實施。有甚於對待越南土人者。此次中委褚民誼氏。過貢。中華總商會。特懇代達駐法高公使。直接與法政府交涉。據理力爭。以濟僑胞之困。西貢敎育。純受法人支配。毫無獨立精神。最大之學校有二。一爲中法學校。LyceeFrancoChinois一爲安南學校。LyceePetru法文爲主。華文爲輔。殖民地特别敎育之訓練。不攻自破矣。</p>
<p>JordinBotanique植物園。拓地數百畝。規模宏壯。植樹不一其種。榕樹之纒繞婆娑。棕梠之高張如傘。奇葩異卉。别饒奇趣。熱帶植物之繁榮。殊無冬夏之判者。歲寒然後知松柏。非所語於此間矣。園中羅列動物亦夥。虎·豹·熊·象·等。範以鐵欄水族除鱷魚外。未睹其他物類。馴象能解人意。鼻常伸出。似向人求食者。投以銅元。則捲而納諸鼻中。轉授於司閽之人。以易香蕉甘蔗之類。藉以果腹。</p>
<p>西貢建築物之宏壯者。以愚所遊。當以法國戲院。及總督府爲最優美。彫刻之玲瓏。壁飾之典麗。揆諸海上。尠與其儔。大街之卓犖者。有杜魯奚街。安南街。水兵街。。總督街。波腦大馬路。及巴黎街等。愚與縵華驅車漫遊。過眼雲烟。殊難追憶。　　華報有中國日報。羣報。南圻華僑日報。及民國日報四種。言論至不自由。處處受當地政府干涉。遇有機關停止辦公之日。未經檢稿即無出版之權。（每逢星期日停刋。因不檢稿。法蘭西以民主先進國號召當世。犧牲億萬人以爭自由。今以己不欲者施諸人。更進而箝制之。摧殘之。羅蘭夫人之目。其能瞑乎。</p>
<h3>談十年來的上海建築·志·政</h3>
<p>上海地方。因爲受了通商口岸之賜。</p>
<p>一方面又加以外人的努力經營。所以内地雖怎樣貧苦。怎樣變亂。而上海到反一天天的發達起來。不談别的。就以我十年來所見到建築物說說吧。</p>
<p>十年前上海的最高房屋。不過六七層樓。那時獨步一時的。便是先施永安。如今呢。大馬路的廣厦。巳層出不窮。譬如華安公司。沙遜房子都於高以外。還加上宏大富麗。市鎭上的房子。攺換門面。重新翻造的。也不計其數。每次一翻造。總是有很顯明的進步。</p>
<p>說到上海最高建築。恐怕要推聖母院路附近的大厦了。那座房子。高約十五層。在目前。恐怕沒有再高的了。其中聽說完全是公寓。公寓的營業。極形發展。因爲它取價廉而又省事所以小家庭的人免得麻煩去賃屋。。便在公寓住下了。除了這所以。外最近在海格霞飛路底也起了一所九層樓的建築。裏面眞是備極富麗。同時在福開森路口。也有一所七樓公寓。係美國儲蓄會所投資的。於此。可見得近代都市人民的住宅。多離開市面很遠。而高建築更爲一般投資家所同趨了。</p>
<p>十年以前。徐家匯一帶。還是一片荒蕪。市鎭上也不過幾間破舊店面而巳。可是現在呢。市面巳攺觀了。房屋也鯽次鱗比了。洋房的在建築中間。更僕難數。總之。巳由荒蕪而妝點得楚楚有致了。所以據我們的觀察。上海市場逐漸的發達。土地的需要。也天天增加。將來的價。也逐步上漲。這時候冷僻的虹橋路。大西路。將來也必定是居住的中心。所以投資在</p>
<h3>重游頤和園記陳家慶</h3>
<p>歲在戊辰。二月旣望國學師生偕游願和園。園爲清那拉后以四百萬海軍費所建。矞皇富麗。窮極侈靡。余於丁卯上巳。與澄宇成禮於園中仁壽殿。此來爲重游。風亭水榭。彌增快意。爰將游踪所及。略紀於次。</p>
<p>園依山築。周迥十里。萬户千。門不能盡窮其勝。曲折而行。達排雲殿。登佛香閣。騅欄廻合。磴道盤旋。其中以珊瑚作撩。翡翠爲疏。凌霄貝闕。勢接瑤天。承露金盤。儻招仙使惟是老佛一去。（宮中呼慈禧爲老佛爺）梵殿頺。頂禮無人。香火絶矣。憑欄小憇。適對昂明。天鏡落目。心波湛然。長空捲雲。上下一碧。太清不滓。絶少舟行。鷗鷺靡猜。堪代漁隱。拾級而下。轉入萬壽山後。山鳥悅人。嶺雲怡我。晴巒偶上。幽徑忽岐。弱草拂裙。横柯礙日。。松華點翠。柳影搖金。風烟淡靜邱壑玲瓏。各罄所携。席地小食。於斯時也。花氣温麽。魚戲萍藻。酒香香狼藉。鳥窺樽罍。旣醉旣飽迤邐下山。人諧趣園。簾前擁翠。石上迎風。修竹參天。垂楊蘸水。素湍若練。迥雪欲流。碧潭成環。倒影可掬。更西行。抵樂壽堂。水木清華。綺寮軒敞。内藏西后少時畫相。氣象崢嶸。蛾眉英絶。則天以後。一人而巳。然而霸圖零落。富貴消沈。瑤池白雲。空望王母。松楸麥飯。誰奠先陵。千古興亡。如出一轍。舟行。抵龍王廟。灜州縹渺。在水一方。如有濳虬。戲於波底。士女偕來。湔裙而去。余等復由十七孔橋登岸。南有知春亭。碧草芊綿。晴波㶑灧。儼在畫圖中矣。北行。過魚樂軒。境極幽邃。俯檻窺魚。風動藻開。悠然來往。似不知有遜國逸民。蹈水以終者嗟嗟。無言芳草。誰念王孫。有涙啼鵑。空悲帝子。萇弘化碧。莫補衰。周弘演剖肝。奚裨亡衛。臨軒憑弔。悵然久之。移時渡湖而來。岸有銅牛。不知幾閱寒暑矣。噫金人　上。能言茂陵。銅駝棘中。誰識典午。憶去歲來游。兄女日生曾戲跨牛背作牧童吹笛狀。韶光荏苒。瞬又一年。行經玉瀾堂。翠華長渺。輦路生苔。金闕徒存。丹墀雜蘚結網在檐。積塵平檻。俛仰盛衰。倐忽旦暮。桑海能移豪華易逝。不隨世變。祇有烟霞。撫茲離宮。不禁感慨系之矣。更北行小憇清宴舫。俯窗四望。蘅蘭漲渚彩翠迥林。微颸不波。風花欲舞。船鑿以石。永鎭湖心。亭峙於峰。高出雲。表神工鬼斧。點綴咸宜。似此園林。敻乎壯巳。巳而夕陽在。山人影散亂。宿鳥歸林。余亦興盡嗟乎。湖山人畫金粉飃香。蠟屐重尋。人生有幾。况復連天烽火。易感刦灰。萬里塵氛。更無凈土。登高望楚。愧乏作賦之才。負笈從師。敢讓當仁之筆。爰藉楮墨。以留雪鴻。調寄臺城路曰。澄波千頃開妝鏡。瓊林又逢花事。玉母宸遊。東皇御宴。歌舞年年歡會。迷金醉紙。看仙殿嵯峩。併香芬翻。千折明廊。最憐宮眷駕親侍。（慈禧每登佛香閣必以某福晋侍輿）繁華應嘆一夢。鼎湖龍去後。都換人世。阿監啼飢。遺民蹈海。幾度供人悉思。湖山聳翠。任蠟屐重尋。畫船閉檥。莫放春歸杜鵑猶帶涙。</p>
<p>那種地方不到十年。成效便可觀了。比了買公債股票。還穩妥多呢。</p>
<h3>記四書課·廉·翁</h3>
<p>滬城西隅某廢寺。有自署十不全老人者。與老僧爲伴。老人爲滇産。曾一度宦蘇。鼎革後僑居滬上。歷十餘年。家屬死亡略盡。宦囊罄矣。乃以四書課餬口。每課取酬四角。日卜两課。即出沽飲。然能奇騐。故趨者若騖。</p>
<p>老人居寺西廊。室中懸一孔子像黎明起後。户外有。人乃盥沐焚香。即取四書六本。課筒一枚。内貯銅錢。三搖後傾於几。如一陽五陰。即爲學庸第一本。再搖則得節數。再搖則得問數。斷章取義。以决諸事。過上午十時閉室矣。某婦失約指來卜。得在與一句。果於包車坐褥下得之。某君以病來卜。得厥疾不瘳一句。病反愈。老人曰。此雄肝厥痰厥不瘳耳。他病何害。酒酣耳熱。恒刺刺告人。究不知其姓名也。</p>
<p>老人又言。中年以漕運渡海赴津於輪艙中遇一老者。授以課法。惟有歌訣一本。巳遺失矣。顧營者不能傅。可傅者不願學。殆將絶矣。靜安路上。應天泉邊酕醄自舞者。即此老人。婦孺咸識之。但呼爲十不全先生而巳。</p>

<p>代表演辭商整代表陸文韶演講、略謂、今天我們紀念陳英士先生的意義、主席巳很詳細地報告過了、中國國民黨處在封建軍閥攺組派西山派和一切反革命份子勾結叛亂的環境之中、是以我們應該一致起來、繼續陳英士先生的不怕死精神、以消滅一切殘餘軍閥和反動勢力、進而依照陳英士先生不妥協精、神修養努力、爲中國全民族獨立自由奮鬭、</p>
<p>宣傅刋物會塲散發之宣傅品甚多、如市宣傅部之時代半月刋、五月革命節紀念瓿巎册、紀念我們的死者陳英士先生傅單小册子標語等多種、</p>

<h3>陳英士紀念塔</h3>
<p>昨日舉行興工典禮</p>
<p>張市長報告建立紀念塔意義</p>
<p>黄郛演說陳氏生平事功人格</p>

<h3>畫的背景中川紀元著陳抱一譯</h3>
<p>在一畫面上、要把背景（BackGrhund）巧妙地配置、是很困難、無論在人物畫或靜物畫上、那作主體的人物或靜物、不是單獨地被處理的、而要賴乎周圍的空間之關係、使實際地活現起來的、　　這並不是屬於先把應爲主體的物象描好了之後、再隨意酌量加塗背景那樣性質的東西、背景、是常與主體關係着、而主體是常與背景關係着的、</p>
<p>假定、在白牆壁前面、置有白色百合花、這两樣都同是白色、的但若把白色顔料照原塗上去、要對配得合這些白色、幾乎是不可能的、雖則說是白色、却也帶着多少青味、或含着黄味等有種種變化、　　在這樣的時候、要看出那微細的變化、只要把花的色和牆壁的色比較觀察、就很可以明白、</p>
<p>不但由於色彩、即由於主體物的輪廓與背景之關係、也能使物象之軟硬度表出、而與背景之距離也能明瞭起來的、　　所以、在繪一幅盡時、須始終分集注意於全遍的畫面上、爲着要表出主體而須注視背景、爲着要表出背景而須注視主體、這般地使互相關連照應着而繼續下去、到主體繪成時就與繪元背景一同時候了、</p>
<p>像瑪替斯也說過在一幅盡面上無論是主體無論是背景、沒有一處是不必要的部分、背景、决不是添補上去的贈彩品、背景如果不充分地遂行其爲背景的職能、則安全的畫面、便不能産生了、</p>
<p>或因背景的調子太强、或筆觸太荒亂致破壤畫面之調和、却往往有的、使弱的東西、柔弱地表出、使從屬的東西、從屬地表出、方才可能保持畫面之節度、　　便在日本畫上、自古以來巳對於什麽都沒有繪着的部分、即所謂餘白者異常重視着、西洋畫風的餘白也是同樣、如人物或花卉、則因那裏有物形、故要描寫牠、只在勞費着種種手法之間、形象便自然而顯出但至於像什麽都沒有的一色的背景那種地方、倒不知要怎樣落筆才好、所以覺得困難、</p>
<p>往往指畫之平板稱爲繪畫上之一種弊病、但這很多都是因由背景之處理不妥所致的、</p>
<p>不可不留心預防背景與前方的物體像貼成一塊那樣扁平、而背景與實物之間缺失「距離」或「空氣」、</p>
<p>講到描寫室内、從窗口看見天空那種畫的情形、若在描寫得好的畫上、却能捕捉得户外的擴展於無限的空間之感、反之、繪得不好的畫、就只見得那裏好像有牆璧擋塞住的樣子或好像雲頭貼住了窗框的樣子、在寫生的畫上、這「空氣」或「空間之感」、是非常重要的、要確實地　捉住這難於捕捉的東西、却是很困難的、</p>
<p>無論什麽都是由正確的自然觀察出發的、繪盡畫法之一種約束、本來是從自然觀察産生的、我們無論在選擇什麽手段方法來繪畫的時候、都常常不可忘却了這點、（油畫之研究譯稿選）</p>
<h3>文學家的故事平</h3>
<p>哥德的戀愛譜</p>
<p>哥德於一七四九年八月二十八日的正午産生、</p>
<p>一七六四年和下等少年們交際、巳常常替人代寫情書、一天晚上在一個朋友家裏飲酒、那時認識了少女克萊脫亨、在那年的四月三日堯才夫做羅馬王的即位式之夜、两人就手牽手的陶醉了甘密的歡樂裏、這是哥德的初戀、</p>
<p>一七六六年在拉波基的友人蕭路賽的親戚家裏和安娜·卡梯利娜發生戀愛、雖是常常相駡、但不久又要好起來、</p>
<p>一七七○年在司脫拉司市學習跳舞、那裏的跳舞師有二個姑娘、一個叫做李辛得、另外一個叫做愛美麗、二個姑娘都愛上了哥德而哥德却祇喜歡了妹子愛美麗、不幸的阿姊接吻了哥德的臉後、說此後誰和哥德親嘴後是不得幸福、的這算在咒咀她自己的妹子、</p>
<p>一七七○年九月騎馬到柴城哈依地方、當時和牧師白利斯　二十一歲的姑娘甫麗特利克發生變愛、</p>
<p>一七七二年三月常常出入於特爾姆斯脫的曼爾克家、那裏有很多美人、並且都愛上他、和他接吻、或是在一塊跳舞、或是同着出去遠足、分别的時候則更是好像很悲傷似的擁抱、</p>
<p>一七七二年五月在上離哀姿拉爾十二里地的奥比爾霍的跳舞會的路上、在某一個家裏看見叫做白甫的少女在分給弟妹們麵包的姿勢、哥德就愛上了她、那晚上跳舞會的會塲上他們就在一起跳舞、於是就成爲戀愛、</p>
<p>一七七二年九月和白甫女士分開、回至特爾姆斯脫的曼爾克家、又和那家十六歲的姑娘瑪克希美安發生戀愛、</p>
<p>一七七五年和安娜·陳麗蕯勃脫（又叫做麗麗依的）發生戀愛、</p>
<p>一七七五年九月在哈特勃爾希愛了W家的姑娘、這位姑娘和往年的戀人甫麗特利克很相像、</p>
<p>一七七六年六月在活衣瑪爾被很多的女子愛上、而這些又都是名貴的男爵夫人公爵夫人以及議員的姑娘們、其中尤以查爾路得·修泰思夫人爲最熱烈而哥德在以前看了夫人的照也巳是十分思慕、</p>
<p>一七七六年三月在拉波基看中了幼年朋友女優哥羅娜·秀魔約德此後她就到活依瑪爾訪哥德、於是又要好起來、　　一七八七年九月旅行到意大利、在一個地方又和瑪特來娜·麗其發生戀愛、　　一七八八年六月回到活衣瑪爾、忽然在公圍裏和一個叫做克麗司契納·維爾比斯的女子相認識、然後就發生戀愛、終於和這位女士結了婚、</p>
<p>一八一四年五月上勃爾卡去時、和一個人家的妻子叫做瑪利安納相識、至九月女的來訪哥德於是又有了交情、　　一八二二年七月哥德七十三歲時、還和一個祗有十六歲的姑娘發生戀愛、並且還要想和她結婚、哥德說、「藝術家是常常有破瓜期的、」</p>
<h3>詩人席勒之戀</h3>
<p>席勒生於一七五九年十一月十日、他於一七八二年十二月因生活困難而由一個寡婦介紹到勃爾白哈去、在那裏和一個叫做查爾路德·奥爾左格的十七歲的姑娘發生戀愛、但是姑娘的母親未曾允許和他結婚、</p>
<p>二十五歲又和一個十七歲的姑娘叫做瑪爾格萊德的發生戀愛、同年又和加爾波夫人戀愛了、</p>
<p>一七八五年在特蘭斯敦附近和一個伯爵的姑娘瑪麗·阿爾尼發生戀愛、這也是因爲姑娘的母親不允許他們結婚、</p>
<p>一七八七年回至勃爾白哈、在那裏和奥爾左格的親戚的姑娘林格非爾特發生戀愛、這才算恭喜的結了婚、</p>
<p>早嘗戀味之李敦卿</p>
<p>李敦卿在文學者的地位上、是英國十九世紀文壇裏占着第一流的樂名的、他是被稱爲長袖文學的標本、而他的一生是常被戀愛所纏繞着的、</p>
<p>十三歲時巳和一個少女戀愛、森林蔭下、小川流處、他年輕的時候、就巳醉心於甘密的戀愛、</p>
<p>曾經一時傅說和拜輪有過關係的加羅林女士據說和李敦也有了關係的</p>
<p>他所發行之戀的書信、就是和他夫人哈拉女士所有的情書、</p>
<p>他做了十年的國會議員、此後被叙爲男爵、又做了殖民長官而終了一生、　　他於一八○○年生於劍橋、一八七四年去世、</p>
<h3>世界文學的故事（一）（五）（五）美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</h3>
<p>第十八章十九世紀的法蘭西詩</p>
<p>有古典的學問和典雅、同時又試作愉快的諧謔底惡戲的詩人是皮耳路意、他那佯稱從希臘語的翻譯的「勃里底斯的歌、」以調子及内容而言、全是希臘風竟致有些年青的批評家受了欺、而老成的批評家則以稱許底的嚴肅考察他的「希臘風味」了、路意被稱爲頺廢派、然而像他這樣美的頺廢派是富於蠱惑力而全然無害的、</p>
<p>在杜哥爾蒙及阿那托爾·法蘭西巳死的現今、法蘭西文壇恐怕幾乎一致承認杜累内是他們全體的領袖·的師長罷、然而中選的詩人的王（選舉的方法全然不明）却是將取材於凡有想得到的法蘭西生活的樣相和從路易十世乃至一九一四年的歷史的「法蘭西民謠集」次第發刋的剛健的多作詩人保爾福爾、他是雄勁而多産、皮相上孟浪而反抗的、但在這一切之下、却也是對於任何法蘭西人、恐怕連眞正的文學者也决不能將自己擺脫的那傅統底形式致敬意的、極細心的作者、福爾用散文的形式寫他的詩句、但當你高聲讀起來時、你便覺到、或者不如說聽到、那些詩句大都是完美直截的詩這位詩人所具的最富於蠱惑力的東西是他那無盡藏的幻像的湧出他那豐饒的發明、他那對於從亂雜無章的心氣乃至柔婉的哀感及見於他的有些戰爭詩中的憤激的一切情緒的支配力、戰爭文學大都是雜志主義底的、沈悶的·興味索然的、然而保爾福爾的詩也許會繼續有着生命罷、爲什麽呢、因爲他是在理姆斯大寺院的蔭影之下誕生·長育的、</p>
<p>較之福爾遠過纎弱、遠不男性底者是在内容上病着的極確實的藝術家、黯淡蒼白的詩人薩曼、他雖有其倦弱的悲哀、却是他在其「味吉爾」這詩中所希望做到的「清純佳妙的輝耀的火熖」、</p>
<p>有些離開法蘭西詩的潮流、却爲「法蘭西的美爾居爾」的編輯者所懇切地歡迎奬勵的詩人、是遠離狂亂的羣集而住於庇里尼斯連山的法蘭西斯詹姆、他依據了地方的傅說、寫出優美的故事來、他所描寫的農夫或山鄉人似乎是眞實的、至少他的詩底語法是「人間之聲」、我並不是想將他置於近代法蘭西詩的高潮點、然而用以結束這一短章或關於詩的任何一章似乎適合的他所有的標題、倒有一個「生的勝利一就是、</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>The United States of Europe</h3>
<p>Last autumn, when Briand initiated the establishment of the United States of Europe at the League of Nations General Assembly, he immediately instructed the committee to study it in detail to be presented at the next League of Nations meeting. At that time, Europeans were shocked by the grandeur of the term "United States" and did not understand its meaning. As a result, there were many discussions. Some believed that Briand's proposal was the same as the Pan-European movement advocated by Count Coudenhove-Kalergi a decade ago. As the world trends towards greater unity, it will inevitably promote the realization of Pan-European, Pan-American, and Pan-Asian federations. Others believed that the name "United States of Europe" was intended to oppose the United States of America and could not help but be associated with federal politics similar to the United States. However, most people believed that Briand's vision was focused on the single point of the European economy. In view of the development of the economic power of the United States, European countries had to find a way to survive. Previously, there was a time when the European Economic Alliance was advocated, and there was also a tariff truce conference. The intention was to renew the economic barrier of Europe. The current so-called United States is mostly intended to continue the previous work, only changing its name. However, it was not expected that today, after reading its published summary, it takes the principle of European countries forming a single entity and clearly states that economic issues are secondary to politics. At first glance, it is indeed like what the American Union calls an organized European Grand Federation. However, in our opinion, Briand's intention is still only to organize a kind of group like an alliance to make cooperation easier. Moreover, his intention is still focused on the economy, but he has to involve politics to organize the economy, so he puts politics first. Otherwise, if he really wants to establish a formal federation, there will be many obstacles. One is whether European countries with colonies should also be included in the scope. One is that countries with sovereignty will be reduced to a member of the federation, and the central conference will make the decisions. Whether the countries can sympathize is the first difficult problem to solve. Other problems are even more impossible. Now Briand has stated that it does not hinder the absolute sovereignty and political independence of the League of Nations, which can prove that it is not a formal federation. Because if you set up a formal League, it is definitely impossible without affecting the sovereignty and independence of the countries. However, even if it is not a formal League, there are many difficulties. In terms of administration, there must be conflicts with the International League of Nations. In terms of economy, the results of the tariff conference are already evident. Under the current state, opinions may be even more difficult to agree on, and success is also difficult to say.</p>

<h3>Briand Proceeds With</h3>
<p>The United States of Europe</p>
<p>The full text of the memorandum has been sent to all of Europe</p>
<p>Except for Soviet Russia and Turkey</p>
<p>Idealism and substance are combined</p>
<p>Close economic and political ties</p>
<p>Responses are limited to July 15th</p>
<p>The European League will hold a meeting in response</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 17th - French Foreign Minister Briand's memorandum advocating the organization of a United States of Europe was delivered to all European countries today, except for Turkey and Russia. At the same time, the European League, chaired by Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, convened a meeting of the executive committee today. Former British Colonial Secretary Amery, former Yugoslav Foreign Minister Ninčić, and other prominent European politicians attended. It is reported that Count Coudenhove-Kalergi and Briand have a close friendship, and this convocation of the meeting is no less than a response to Briand's memorandum.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Paris, 17th - The full text of Briand's memorandum on the United States of Europe was released this afternoon. People in political circles are speculating about the results, because this memorandum was beyond the expectations of ordinary people. It has exceeded the scope of soliciting opinions and has a slightly concrete plan. Its purpose is to organize a large European confederation, with the French as the leader. However, the content of the memorandum combines idealism and substance, which can be regarded as an excellent model representing the French. Although there is no underestimation of the difficulties in the text, it has been regarded as a plan that is likely to be realized. The memorandum first summarizes the history of this plan in the preface, saying that France, at the League of Nations General Assembly last autumn, tried to persuade European member states to discuss the method of organizing the United States of Europe. At that time, representatives of 27 countries unanimously agreed that it was necessary to establish a certain basis for joint work, and all guaranteed to persuade the government to study this matter. In spirit, the principle of the United States of Europe has been established. Therefore, he ordered the drafting of a memorandum to raise major issues. In addition, it was declared that the organization of the United States of Europe has absolutely no intention of dealing with any country or group, but to cooperate with the world to seek self-help, so there is no conflict with the interests of the United States of North America and Soviet Russia. Briand's remarks were intended to dispel the misunderstandings of the two countries. The main text after the preface is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is titled "The Principle of Concluding a Convention to Establish a Spiritual Union of Europe, Striving for the Necessary Unity of Nations." The text advocates that the formula used should strive for generosity and freedom, but at the same time, it should guarantee that the signatory countries will hold meetings on time to consider all issues related to the United States of Europe. The second chapter proposes to establish an administrative tool to convene pan-European conferences on time, with the chairman being re-elected once a year, and an executive committee elected by the conference as the permanent executive body of the United States. The third chapter states the necessity of determining the organizational procedures of the United States, believing that economic issues in the procedures must be secondary to political issues, because the progress of economic integration must be judged by security issues, and security issues are closely related to political integration. The fourth chapter discusses several issues that should be discussed in the future Pan-European Conference, and lists various transitional issues, such as the cultural backwardness in Europe, the development of various places, and the cooperation of national parliaments. Finally, it asks the governments of various countries to reply before July 15th, and expresses the deep belief that the replies of various countries will be based on the conscience of the people, and that they will live up to the expectations of the people, because the need to rebuild Europe is no greater than at this time, and the opportunity for its success is no better than today. After the European War, all the important problems that have occurred materially and spiritually, once resolved, will soon be able to release all the burdens of the European revival in terms of spirit and production mechanism. In short, unity in order to survive and prosper is the most urgent goal of European countries today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 17th - French Foreign Minister Briand sent a note to 26 European countries (all members of the League of Nations), saying that the organizers of the United States of Europe officially released the original text today. The note asks countries to express their opinions by October 15th on whether it is necessary to conclude a convention to recognize that Europe is spiritually allied and that the principle of uniting European countries as a whole is the goal, and asks countries to express their opinions on the following points: (1) Establish a representative and responsible body, called the European Council; (2) Establish an administrative body or a standing committee; (3) Establish a secretariat. Briand also said that the political committee can prepare the procedures for this European group. Under these procedures, political events should be given priority and economic events should be second. He also said that the scope of European cooperation should include general economic issues, public works, transportation, finance, labor, colonies, and health, and cultural cooperation should also be included. Briand declared that the European Union is not used to deal with any country outside Europe, nor does it hinder the absolute sovereignty and political independence of the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>Seven Daggers as Gifts</h3>
<p>Japanese Navy Minister Returns Home, Startled</p>
<p>Assassin Apprehended on the Spot</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Shimonoseki, 18th - Finance Minister was welcomed by a majority of officials and civilians upon landing in Shimonoseki this morning. After landing, he issued the following statement: "I am grateful that national opinion unanimously supports my plenipotentiary at the London Conference. The plenipotentiaries of various countries have demonstrated the spirit of mutual concession and compromise. The issue of the right of command cannot be criticized indiscriminately at this time." When the Finance Minister was about to board the special express train leaving Shimonoseki, a man dressed in a black suit, holding a package wrapped in gift paper in his right hand, slowly approached the Finance Minister and handed it over in person. The Finance Minister asked in surprise what it was. When he opened it, he found a white-sheathed seven-dagger, eight and a half inches long, hidden inside. He immediately changed color. At this time, Kurozaki, the governor of Yamaguchi Prefecture, who was on the side, was shocked and immediately seized it and handed it over to Tsutsui, the Shimonoseki Police Chief, who was also on the side. The chief held it upside down, causing the seven daggers to fall out and land near the Finance Minister's feet. Taking advantage of this chaos, the criminal had already mingled into the crowd to escape, but was soon arrested by the police. The criminal lives in Kasuga-cho, Shimonoseki City, and is currently residing in Oji Kamijujo, Tokyo Prefecture. He has no occupation. His name is Ichinosuke Tachimura, 38 years old. Angered by the Finance Minister's 70% concession, he brought a declaration to Shimonoseki from Tokyo on the 16th to present the seven daggers to the Finance Minister. He also distributed leaflets while escaping. The text reads: "Prohibit being intimidated by Britain and the United States, distort the empire's claims, and the Finance Minister of national shame, Tsubouchi, landing ashore."</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - Whether the Military Council will be convened after the Finance Minister returns to Beijing has become a major issue of immediate concern. The Jiji Shinpo reported today that whether the government can prevent the convocation is questionable, even though Railway Minister Eguchi has been actively campaigning. On the other hand, some within the party are taking a tough stance, unwilling to shy away from a battle if the Privy Council wants to thoroughly interfere with the administration. Prime Minister Hamaguchi denied in Kamakura that there was any attempt to prevent the convocation of the Military Council.</p>
<h3>China Bans Gold Exports</h3>
<p>Appropriate Measures to Remedy the Silver Crisis</p>
<p>Anticipate Annam to Follow Suit</p>
<p>Associated Press, New York, 17th - According to the opinions published by financial experts, China's ban on the import of silver is focused on resisting the indiscriminate sale of Saigon silver dollars. China's ban on the export of cash is not surprising, because China's cash reserves are extremely short and it is still a silver standard, so this move is relatively unimportant. It is expected that Annam will soon follow suit.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 18th - Because China has banned the export of gold, the channel for Japan to import gold has been cut off, which may cause a major impact on the exchange at the Bank of Japan. Banks are paying attention to future developments.</p>

<p>Associated Press, Wewoka, Oklahoma, 17th - The new oil well here suddenly overflowed, causing the oil stored in Phillips Petroleum Company's oil wells to gush out of the pipe. The momentum is extremely fierce and difficult to control. According to experts' estimates, the oil surging up every day amounts to 15,000 barrels. Hundreds of attempts to stop it have been ineffective. Fearing that the overflowing oil would catch fire and cause a prairie fire, the authorities ordered all vehicles to stay away from the area and hired workers to try to extract the spilled oil.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Central Army Encircles Guide City</h3>
<p>Xuzhou-Guide Passenger Train Service Restored</p>
<p>Observations on the Battle Situation on the Longhai Line</p>
<p>Xuzhou Express News: After the Central Army moved out from the Longhai Line, it has been advancing steadily. The vanguard of the Central Route, the 3rd Division, occupied Zhuji Railway Station on the 14th and advanced on Xiaoba, capturing many prisoners. However, a portion of the enemy troops in Guide City are still holding on stubbornly. The 11th Division advanced to encircle the city, and the 1st Teaching Division was added to the encirclement on the 15th. The artillery team of Xiang Zhizhuang also advanced to bombard the city and transported a large number of tanks from the rear to Guide to vigorously attack the city. It is expected to be captured in the near future. The track destroyed at Zhuji Railway Station has been repaired by the railway authorities. Military transport vehicles can reach Zhuji from the 15th, but many roads along the way have been damaged. Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, accompanied by He Xianhua, Chief Engineer of the Xuzhou Engineering Section, led craftsmen and personnel to transport seven material cars from Xuzhou to Zhuji Railway Station on the evening of the 15th to repair the tracks along the way and inspect the route. From today (16th), Xuzhou Station has started selling passenger tickets to Guide Railway Station, but due to the lack of vehicles, only one mixed passenger and transport train is operated daily. Regarding the enemy's situation, according to military intelligence, the Jin army arriving at Lanfeng Liuhe has increased its forces to the front and has made contact with our vanguard approaching Xiaoba. After the battles of Mamujizhi, Wan Xuancai's troops only had more than 1,000 people who collapsed westward. Recently, the division of Liu Chunrong has been added to the eastern Henan area to set up defenses west of Kaocheng and build fortifications. Lu Xiuwen has assembled the bandit gangs of Dong Laosi to harass the rear of the Jin army in Puyang. Feng Junye is advancing east of Zhengzhou. However, observing the enemy's deployment, there are heavy defenses in eastern Henan, seemingly taking a defensive posture, while taking an offensive posture in western Shandong. The other day, Shi Yousan's troops in western Shandong were repelled by Fan Xiji's troops. According to Han Fuju's telegram to Xuzhou, Shi Yousan telegraphed that he had retreated north of the Yellow River to concentrate in Linqing and Dezhou for orders, please forward to the main seat for instructions. Sun Dianying's troops were repelled by Yang Shengzhi's army in northern Anhui, and the remnants were trapped in Bozhou and surrounded. A representative sent by Sun to Xuzhou for negotiations left Xuzhou southward on the 15th to go to Bozhou to convey the central government's intentions and will return to Xuzhou to report within a few days. Based on this, the former troops of Wan Shi and Sun of the enemy army are no longer a problem. After this, it has almost reached the time for the main forces of Yan and Feng to go to war, and the outcome can be determined. (16th)</p>
<p>News from a Follow-up Reporter: A special train headed towards the Longhai Line on the morning of the 15th and arrived at Dangshan Railway Station at 2:00 PM. All the soldiers guarding the station had moved forward. The newly laid light railway meandered into the wheat fields. A large amount of railway materials used by the Transportation Department were piled up on the side of the road. Because the road along the railway line was destroyed by the retreating enemy army, it has now been roughly repaired, but the speed of the train is slightly slower. It arrived at Mamuji at 4:00 PM and continued west. It arrived at Guide Station at 5:00 PM. Chief Commander Liu and the Chief of Staff, the Director of the Engineering Corps of the Ministry of Military Affairs, etc., had just returned from Guide City to inspect the defenses. Guide Railway Station was occupied by the Central Army yesterday morning, and Wan's troops had retreated into Guide City. The city is about 13 li away from the station. The total area of the city is about 16 li. There is an earthen stockade about a li outside the city, with a perimeter of about 17 or 18 li. The earthen moat must be breached first when attacking the city. When the train arrived at the station, gunshots could still be faintly heard, which was what the area was conveying. The Central Army is currently guarding three sides of the city with six regiments, leaving the southwest corner as their escape route. The artillery team will arrive at the position tonight. The armored car is also waiting to depart at the station because the front railway tracks have not been completely repaired.</p>
<p>The Central Army has established solid contact with the Central Army units in Henan and Shandong. The communication line between the enemy troops in Bozhou and Guide has been cut off. At about 6:00 PM today, sentries captured a liaison staff officer and a servant between Wan Xuancai and Sun Chu within the sentry line and found an urgent letter written by Wan Xuancai. The Shandong Central Army has advanced to Dingtao and Heze. The line of Bozhou has advanced to Yizhoujiakou and other places, echoing the Central Army units stationed in Luohe Xuchang and other places. The encirclement of Lanfeng Kaifeng Zhengzhou and Luoyang has been formed. The attack on the troops directly under Yan and Feng will be within two or three days. Vendors and residents near the railway station live and do business as usual. It is said that the troops stationed at the station by the former Wan's forces would lie down whenever they heard the sound of airplanes. The planes came and went quickly, and the bombing was extremely fierce. When our infantry arrived, they resisted slightly and retreated into the city. Last night, I stayed at Guide Station. In the evening, there was a strong wind and dust, heavy rain at night, and a chill. This morning, a group of prisoners was sent from the front, about 200 people, who gathered at the station. Some of the prisoners had complete clothing and footwear. The artillery team of the 2nd Teaching Division arrived at the station one after another and departed. In the morning report, the enemy in the Liuhe area attacked with all their strength this morning. The 11th Division and other units of the Central Army met the attack and inflicted heavy damage on them. At 11 o'clock, the train turned towards Mamuji. Today, the Longhai passenger train has resumed service to Guide. The telecommunications between Guide and Dangshan have not yet been restored to their original state, so I did not receive any telegrams from the rear in Guide yesterday. Now that I have arrived in Dangshan, a lot of telegrams have piled up. Wireless radio is not used much in the front because wireless radio is easily intercepted by the enemy and the news is easily leaked. (Sent from the train in Dangshan on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Mo Dehui Arrives in Moscow</h3>
<p>Arrived at the Location at 10:00 AM on the 9th</p>
<p>Sino-Russian Conference Scheduled to Open on the 20th</p>
<p>A dispatch from Harbin on the 12th. This morning, the Office of the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway received a telegram from Mo Dehui from Moscow, reporting that he had arrived in Moscow. The telegram read: "To Director Li and all colleagues from the Office of the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway in Harbin. I arrived in Moscow at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. Many people welcomed me at the station. The Foreign Affairs Department hosted a banquet for me and the experts in the evening. I report this to you, Mo Dehui." According to a report from the Russian side of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau from Moscow, the Minister and his party arrived at Moscow Station at 10:30 AM on the morning of the 9th. All members of the Traffic and Foreign Affairs Departments welcomed them at the station. There were also thousands of government officials and civilians welcoming them. The situation was very warm. Li Weinuofu and Karahan, members of the Foreign Affairs Committee, were scheduled to host a banquet for the Minister and his party on the evening of the 10th. The Minister of Transport hosted a reception on the evening of the 11th. Minister Mo was scheduled to meet with the heads of various Soviet Russian departments on the 12th and visit foreign envoys to Russia on the 13th. The opening date of the Sino-Russian conference was set around the 20th. It is reported that there was heavy snowfall in Russia and the weather was extremely cold. Fortunately, Mo and the members brought cotton-padded clothing and wore them after crossing Dauria. The exhaled air turned into clouds, no less than in mid-winter. Therefore, the delegation spent the whole day curled up in the carriage. The weather did not clear until the 8th. When they arrived in Moscow, the climate turned warmer. The delegation's itinerary was as scheduled by the Russian side. They transferred to a Russian train at Dauria at noon on May 2nd, arrived in Chita early in the morning on May 3rd, arrived in Irkutsk at 12:00 PM on May 4th, arrived in Novosibirsk at 1:30 AM on May 6th, and arrived in Kemin at 7:30 AM on May 7th, and arrived in Tyukhtyat at 1:30 AM on the morning of the 8th. At each station they passed, specialists from the Russian Foreign Affairs and Transportation Departments greeted them. In Chita, they were welcomed by local military and political leaders and civilians. Specialists from the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee also accompanied them at all times. Every time they arrived at a station, a telegram was sent to notify the previous station and its Foreign Affairs and Transportation Departments, so the military police at each station took special care. On the day of arrival in Moscow, Minister Mo got off the train first and stayed at our embassy in the evening. His entourage and experts got off the train the next morning and moved into the embassy building, which had been recently renovated by the Russian side and was quite new inside and out. There was no question about the accommodation. According to the Russians here, the Russian government had already appointed Karahan as its plenipotentiary on May 7th.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Plans to Draft</h3>
<p>Draft of Regulations on Boundary Demarcation for Provinces, Cities, and Counties</p>
<p>Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Forwarding to the National Government for Approval and Promulgation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior notes that the administrative regions of provinces and counties in our country mostly follow the old system of prefectures, departments, and counties of the previous Qing dynasty without proper reorganization. In recent years, frequent reforms to the administrative system, discrepancies in the boundaries of provinces and cities due to territorial changes, or confusion due to old boundaries have led to repeated disputes. Dozens of cases have been jointly reviewed and demarcated by the Ministry and provincial and municipal governments, but they have been unresolved for a long time. The problem is that there is no definitive standard to base the review on, which makes deliberation difficult. Moreover, whenever a boundary dispute arises, both local governments and people's organizations often cite evidence, extensively consult local chronicles, and engage in divergent discussions, making it impossible to reach a consensus. Neighboring territories almost become like enemy states, with no one willing to cede an inch of land. In the end, due to the remoteness of time and frequent changes in history, although maps exist, the exact location is difficult to determine, leading to unresolved cases. This often results in tragic armed conflicts with no effective solution. In essence, all land belongs to the country. Whether it belongs to Party A or Party B, there should be no distinction between "this boundary" and "that boundary." If the central government can establish principles for demarcating boundaries based on the natural features of the land, the convenience of administrative jurisdiction, and other factual issues as standards for establishing and defining boundaries, then all disputes that violate the spirit of the times, overemphasize historical concepts, and are full of feudal ideas can be easily resolved. The boundary disputes among provinces, cities, and counties in recent years can be easily resolved by redefining their scope based on these principles. As for those provinces, cities, and counties where the old boundaries are very clear and have never been disputed, their inherent boundaries should be maintained without the need for re-demarcation to avoid disturbances. Currently, a draft of fourteen articles of the Regulations on Boundary Demarcation for Provinces, Cities, and Counties has been prepared and submitted to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the National Government for approval and promulgation, so that all provinces and cities can follow and implement them. The draft of the regulations is recorded as follows: (Article 1) When the administrative regions of provinces, cities, and counties need to be newly defined due to unclear boundaries or changes in organization, they shall be reviewed and approved in accordance with these regulations. (Article 2) The organization of the administrative regions of provinces, cities, and counties shall be based on the following principles: 1. Natural features of the land; 2. Convenience of administrative jurisdiction; 3. Industrial and commercial conditions; 4. Number of households and population; 5. Transportation conditions; 6. Construction plans; 7. Other special circumstances. (Article 3) The division of administrative boundaries of provinces, cities, and counties shall, except in special circumstances, be based on the following standards: 1. The watershed of mountain ranges; 2. The centerline of roads and rivers; 3. Permanent passes, embankments, bridges, and other solid structures that can serve as boundaries. (Article 4) The administrative regions of provinces, cities, and counties that have already clearly defined boundaries before the promulgation of these regulations and have never been disputed, and those that are not inconvenient in any way, shall maintain their inherent regional boundaries. (Article 5) If the inherent administrative regions of provinces, cities, and counties are indeed too unclear, resulting in disputes, they may be re-demarcated and new boundaries agreed upon in accordance with the principles of the various items stipulated in Article 2 of these regulations. (Article 6) The boundaries of newly established administrative regions of provinces, cities, and counties shall, unless otherwise expressly stipulated, be surveyed and discussed in accordance with the principles of the various items stipulated in Article 2 of these regulations. (Article 7) If any of the following circumstances occur in the inherent administrative regions of counties, their organization may be changed and their boundaries re-demarcated when necessary: 1. When it is necessary to merge or change them due to changes in the administrative regions of provinces or cities; 2. When the inherent regions conflict too much with the natural features, hindering transportation; 3. When the inherent regions are too irregular, such as enclaves, exclaves, interlocked areas, and other intricately interwoven areas, which are very inconvenient for administrative management; 4.

<h3>Central Training Department</h3>
<p>A Letter to Comrades Regarding the Training Conference</p>
<p>The Central Training Department, feeling the brevity of the period of political tutelage and the arduousness of the training work, and in order to understand the actual situation of training work in various places and to unify and promote its work, specially convened senior party cadres responsible for training in various places after the Third Plenary Session of the current Central Committee to hold a National Training Conference. Representatives from various places, from near places such as Shanghai and Jiangsu, and far places such as Europe and America, came to Beijing, traversing long distances, and gathered together to present their past training work, discuss the difficult problems in their work, and agree on improvements to the future training policy and implementation plans. This is truly an unprecedented grand event for the Department. Although the time was short and it was not possible to clear up all the past problems or formulate concrete plans for the future, it has extensively consulted and separately decided on the training work that should be carried out during the period of political tutelage and the current difficult problems. The colleagues of the Department and the representatives from various places who participated in this conference, feeling the difficulty of convening this conference and the magnitude of its importance, are sincerely speaking in detail to the comrades engaged in training work in various places, to the comrades of the Party, and to the compatriots of the whole country, to the best of their knowledge.</p>
<p>The teachings of our Party's General Director and his newly created revolutionary theories can both adapt to the trend of the times and are suitable for the needs of China. Their profundity and breadth are unmatched by the doctrines of various scholars at home and abroad throughout history. Therefore, with one move, the imperial lineage of the Aisin Gioro clan was overthrown, and with another move, the reactionary group of feudal remnants, warlords, and bureaucrats was overthrown. Although our General Director was unable to complete the great cause of the National Revolution in his lifetime, his great doctrine and detailed strategy have been admired by the world and future generations. Therefore, since the death of the General Director and the opening of party affairs, the people of the whole country, believing in the doctrine of the General Director, have joined the Party in a sudden and rapid surge. The organization of the Party has spread to various places at home and abroad, and the number of party members has multiplied. With the daily addition of new party members, the work of training has become increasingly urgent. This is speaking from the recent situation within the Party. Moreover, the stage of our Party's revolution has entered the period of political tutelage from military rule. The so-called political tutelage is the preparatory work of first training the people in order to eventually return power to the people. The Chinese people have long been indifferent to national politics. Since the saying "not in their position, not planning their affairs" arose, great traitors and cunning schemers have been able to usurp their power and seize it as their own, causing the poison of autocracy to last for thousands of years. The reason why the General Director's revolutionary program did not immediately advance from military rule to constitutional rule, but was mediated by political tutelage, is that the people of the whole country have long been trapped in the shackles of autocracy, not only lacking the ability of political life, but also lacking the interest in political activities. If power were to be hastily granted to the people at this time, it would be tantamount to granting a good opportunity for traitors to usurp it and still squeeze the people into deep water and scorching fire. Looking back at the past, the warlord separatism and the repeated collapse of the republic since 1911, leading to continuous wars and the people's suffering, is the result of not implementing political tutelage. The comrades of our Party, having learned from the failure of the 1911 Revolution and feeling the people's livelihood declining, the foundation of the country shaking, the remaining poisons not cleared, and the hidden dangers not eliminated, cannot bear to make another attempt and sacrifice the nation and the country. Therefore, after the completion of unification, they announced a six-year period of political tutelage to implement the General Director's legacy and complete the Party's mission. However, the six years are limited, and the work of political tutelage is difficult. The reason why our Party has established training departments at all levels is to train party members and supervise the work of political tutelage. The responsibilities of the training departments at all levels of our Party are explained in detail in the declarations and resolutions of the Second National Congress, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, and in the historical documents of our Party, which can be reviewed without unnecessary elaboration. As for its work, although it is divided into four major categories: (1) Party member training, (2) mass training, (3) party doctrine education, and (4) scout training, in summary, the training undertaking is actually a widespread and in-depth large-scale educational work carried out under the leadership of the Party. The training departments and sections of the party committees at all levels are the central hub of this large-scale educational undertaking, so their diligence or negligence is directly related to the success or failure of the revolution, the rise or fall of the country, and the survival or extinction of the nation. In short, it can be divided into four items: (1) How to make all party members adhere to the party's doctrine, abide by the party's discipline, work hard for the party, lead the masses by example, and move towards the path of the Three People's Principles to promote the thorough success of the National Revolution. (2) How to make the people of the whole country believe in the party's doctrine, understand the party's policies, follow the plans promulgated by the central government, establish the foundation of mass training, and promote local autonomy and complete the construction of political tutelage under the guidance and supervision of the party committees and government. (3) How to integrate the Three People's Principles of our party into various education in the country to popularize the training of the Three People's Principles and build a society of the Three People's Principles. (4) How to develop children's instincts, cultivate the spirit and habits of self-reliance, mutual assistance, bravery, sacrifice, love of the nation, and love of humanity, so that they have noble personalities, rich common sense, and healthy bodies, so that they can be loyal successors to the Three People's Principles. All these four items are the minimum standards of the training work of our party during the period of political tutelage. The training departments at all levels should strictly abide by the teachings of the General Director, follow the instructions of the central government, and cooperate with all parties to promote the progress.

<h3>Chen and Han Go to Caozhou for Inspection</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After Chen Tiaoyuan arrived in Jining on the 14th, he set off from Jining on the 15th with Fan Xiji and others to inspect the defenses in the areas of Jiaxiang, Juye, and Longguji. Han Fuju also brought his chief of staff, Li Zongbi, and others to Juye to discuss everything with Chen and Fan. Today (the 16th), they went to Yuncheng for inspection. It is reported that they will then go to Chengwu, Dingtao, Cao County, Shan County, and Jinxiang for inspection, and then return to Jining. The front line has been silent in recent days. Shi Yousan's troops, in view of the victory of the central army on the Longhai Line, dare not advance eastward. Yue Shengxuan, commander of the 57th Division stationed in Cao County, is supervising his troops and cooperating with local people to repair the city walls to strengthen the defense. Jiang Bocheng, chief of staff of the field headquarters, was originally scheduled to go to Jining today to discuss everything with Han and others. However, upon hearing that Chen and Han had gone to the front, he did not go. Jiang plans to meet Han after he returns and then decide whether to go. According to reports, on the northern Shandong front, Han Fuju's most advanced sentry post is located five miles south of the Zhangzhuang Railway Station north of Yucheng. The Jin army cavalry is still north of Ershilipu, 20 miles south of Pingyuan City, and dare not advance south. The Jin army in Dezhou is about two regiments, and Shi Yousan's troops are the fewest. Armored vehicles still travel between Jinan and Zhangzhuang for inspection, and the road is as calm as ever. (May 16)</p>
<h3>Gangs of Bandits in Jiaodong</h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The bandits in various parts of Jiaodong have recently sprung up like weeds after rain and are everywhere. The local militias are powerless to resist and can only endure their looting. Recently, a large gang of bandits in the southern part of Jiaoxian County has become increasingly rampant after defeating the county militia a few days ago. They commit robbery, kidnapping, rape, and all kinds of atrocities. Before the banditry in the south of the county is quelled, banditry suddenly occurred in the east of the county. It is reported that there are about a hundred bandits entrenched in the Zhaizi area in the east of the county, with complete guns and equipment, and several hand-held machine guns. The bandit force is huge, and villages far and near are paying money to avoid the scourge. Also, in the Yangjiaogou area of Shouguang, there are also hundreds of bandits harassing the local area. Also, the bandit leader Cui Jiu of Zichuan County has been entrenched on the border of Guangrao County for more than ten years. Recently, he has joined forces with the bandits Bai Damu, Yin Fudong, Wang Dadou, Dou Baoqing, etc., gathering more than 300 people to cause trouble in the eastern part of Zichuan. On the 10th of this month, they kidnapped 80 women from Luozhuang in the eastern part of the county. Those with better looks were forced to marry. The people in the nearby villages have all fled, and there are few pedestrians on the road. Also, bandits harass each county in Pingdu, Jimo, Muping, and Laiyang, with as few as dozens and as many as hundreds of people, running rampant everywhere. There are dozens of cases of robbery and kidnapping every day. Therefore, Jiaodong has become a world of bandits today. It is also reported that reactionaries have recently secretly sent emissaries to various counties in Jiaodong to contact bandits in order to create chaos. If the authorities do not find a way to suppress them, I am afraid that they will become a hidden danger. (May 15)</p>

<h3>Promotion of the Hubei Jinshui Project</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Waterway Regulation Committee was established more than two years ago, and the most notable achievement of its surveying work is the Hubei Jinshui area. Previously, Song Xishang, Director of the Engineering Department of the Committee, prepared a draft plan for the Hubei Jinshui Regulation Project, including engineering design and budget, which was submitted by the Ministry of Transportation to the Central Government for approval. Now, the Chairman of the Committee, Li Zhonggong, believes that the period of material construction and the spirit of political tutelage should advance together. Therefore, he is working hard to fulfill his responsibilities. Only after the implementation of this project can we celebrate its completion. Not only will the counties such as Jiayu in Hubei be spared from flooding, but also an annual land value of 39.12 million yuan and an annual agricultural income of more than 3.9 million yuan can be obtained. This is of great importance to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Therefore, it has been decided to take the regulation of Hubei Jinshui as the preliminary step for the implementation of the Yangtze River regulation project. Currently, Song Xishang, Director of the Engineering Department of the Committee, has been specially dispatched to take the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jianguo ship on the 14th to contact the Hubei authorities and the Hubei Jinshui Promotion Association separately, to work together to promote this great project. It is reported that the Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau also pays special attention to this project and is very willing to see its early completion. It has submitted it to the Provincial Government for detailed discussion.</p>
<h3>China Communications Bank and Hankou Bank Establish Creditor Group</h3>
<p>Since the China Communications Bank and Hankou Bank notes suspended convertibility, the noteholders have repeatedly requested redemption, but it has not been implemented. Recently, it was reported that the noteholders, due to their capital losses, have had to organize a creditor group, hire attorney Ma Xuchang as legal counsel, and set up an office at No. 17 Hanrunli, Hankou, to proceed legally and request redemption. At the same time, they telegraphed the Shanghai and Hankou head and branch offices for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Deployment for Bandit Prevention in the Upper Reaches of the Han River</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The upper reaches of the Han River, adjacent to Fujian and Jiangxi, have recently been occupied by the remnant bandits of Zhu and Mao in Huichang, Junmenling, Xunwu, and other areas. Zhou Zhiqun's rebellious soldiers have fled into the eight prefectures of western Fujian, including Tingzhou. The garrison troops of the Guangdong Province in Chaozhou and Shantou have therefore been transferred to the upper reaches of the Han River, such as Songkou and Jiaoling in Meixian County, to strictly guard the bandit and Communist areas on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi. Mao Weishou, the brigade commander of the 8th Brigade, is digging trenches in Jiaoling City and Gaosi Township, etc., three feet wide and one foot high, and dozens of miles long. There are also several trenches in Songkou and Songyuan, etc. Brigade Commander Mao posted a notice in Meixian County on the 10th to build five blockhouses, two along the mountain and one each at the east, west, and north gates, in order to send troops to garrison. Also, the 4th Independent Regiment of Zhang Zhiying's troops arrived in Songkou, Meixian County, on the 8th to garrison. The 16th Regiment of Zhang Li's troops was transferred to Wuhua Shuizhai to suppress bandits. Wuhua County, Meilin, Anliu, Qinjia, and other areas were occupied by the Communist bandits Gu Dacun and Li Mingguang, who have a strong momentum. The local militia fought to the death to resist, and the county seat is in danger. If the 16th Regiment arrives, it will be able to turn the tide.</p>
<p>Feng Xingcun, Chairman of the Pantian Security Association in Fengshun County, discovered on the 5th that there were more than a hundred Communist bandits gathering at Niugushi, so he summoned the guards to fight. He fought with the bandits for several hours in the deep mountains of Meiziba, and finally defeated the bandits. In this battle, more than ten bandits were killed and captured, and a black war horse, which was left behind by Zhu De when he fled Fengshun last year, was seized. The horse is extremely strong and tall, and it is produced in Shandong. Also, rumors have been spreading frequently in the Sanhe area of Dapu in recent days. A joint defense meeting was specially held on the 8th, with Fan Weiqin as chairman. It was resolved to extract two months of store rent donation, purchase more guns, and train the militia to assist the local government in preventing bandits. It is also reported that after Zhang Zhen returned to Zhangzhou, he transferred the Chen Linrong Regiment to Yongfu Punan to defend against Chen Guohui, and transferred the Wang Zuqing Regiment to Dapu Raoping to consolidate the Fujian-Guangdong border defense, and transferred the Yang Yuting Regiment of Raoping back to Shan Cheng, Pinghe, to guard against the local Communists in Longyan. Recently, the troop movements of the Fujian and Guangdong border troops have been quite busy. (May 12)</p>

<p>Provincial Order to End the Village Clearing Affairs: The province believes that the Village Clearing conducted by the county has been ongoing for months without visible results, and has ordered it to be concluded immediately, pending the issuance of a comprehensive plan for continued implementation. Director Zhang has complied with the order and concluded the affairs, and all branch bureaus have been abolished. Of the budgeted eight thousand four hundred and forty yuan for the Village Clearing expenses, only two thousand seven hundred and ninety-five yuan have been collected, and personnel are being dispatched to collect the remaining funds. Over two hundred male and female prisoners in custody are being expedited for trial.</p>
<p>Reorganization of the Public Security Bureau: Zhang Zunshi, the newly appointed director of the Nantong County Public Security Bureau, took office on the 17th. He announced the appointments of Sun Zongying as the head of the First Section, Xu Wei as the head of the Second Section, Hu Peixin as the head of the Third Section, Zhu Yiqing as the Chief Inspector, Zhang Shushen as the head of the Special Service Inspection Team, Liu Jinming as the head of the Taxation Affairs, and Wang Yuntai as the Postal and Telegraph Inspector.</p>
<p>Private Patrol Boat's Weapons and Ammunition Robbed: A private patrol boat of the Huainan Smuggling Suppression Patrol stationed at Yudong Baochang was ordered to return to the Shagang camp headquarters. At the Dakou River in Yudong, it was intercepted by bandits, who robbed over ten quick-firing guns, box cannons, and all the ammunition on board. They also kidnapped the captain and two soldiers, but the boat was allowed to proceed.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Telegram Requesting Severe Punishment for the Robbery of Ships Case: The shipping companies in Zhenjiang, including Fuyun, Xiehe, Zhentong, and Shenji, reported that their ships had been robbed one after another in the Xihewan Wutaishan area within Jiangdu County, but the cases remain unsolved. On the 14th of this month, three ships from Fuyun and Zhentong were again robbed in the Erjinzhen Nan Ershiwuli Temple area. The bandits fired over a hundred shots, and the search lasted for three hours. There were also casualties. Such banditry is becoming more rampant, and the bandits are getting closer, acting with impunity. This will inevitably discourage travel, disrupt commerce, and impede finance, and its impact on society is incalculable. They jointly presented a petition to the Chamber of Commerce requesting that it be forwarded to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs and the Security Bureau, requesting that the Provincial Affairs Council seriously address the robbery of ships case, establish preventive measures.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the County Chamber of Commerce: The County Chamber of Commerce has been in existence for a year. After the promulgation of the new Chamber of Commerce Law by the Autonomous Legislative Court, the County Chamber of Commerce produced seven preparatory committee members through a joint meeting of supervisors and executors, reporting to the county government and sending a letter to the County Party Department. The County Party Department believed that the preparatory committee was established and the members were selected without the Party's guidance, and the procedures were not in accordance with the law, and decided to dissolve the preparatory committee. On the afternoon of the 16th, the Chamber of Commerce held the fourth joint meeting. The County Party Department sent Zhu Xiaochang to provide guidance and nominated Lu Junyi, Wang Yiyun, Ji Hehua, Yin Zhongren, Wang Guanqin, Pan Jingbo, and Yin Zhaoyong as seven preparatory committee members for the reorganization. The old Chamber of Commerce was dissolved.</p>
<p>Robbery Case Occurs at Baitangqiao: The home of Shen Chunxi, the village head of Baitangqiao, Section 13, Changjing, and the wealthiest man in the area, was entered by twenty to thirty bandits the night before. They scaled the walls, tied up Shen Chunxi and his son, tortured them for silver dollars, and robbed the house of all valuables and silver dollars. Afterwards, the bandits forbade them from making any noise, threatening to kill the entire family otherwise.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding Causes Major Conflict in the Dispatch Office: Since Director Li took office, the County Government's Dispatch Office has appointed a dispatch director, one administrative and one judicial clerk, and one petition writer. They have strictly prohibited the demand for kickbacks and the obstruction of litigants. On the afternoon of the 16th, Wang Tongsheng from the Construction Bureau inquired with Liu Hanying, the petition writer, about the bail procedures. Liu Jiyingsun, the dispatch director, suspected that there was a kickback involved and questioned him, leading to a conflict. After explaining to Director Li, Director Li believed that Director Liu was overly suspicious and that Liu Hanying was not involved. However, Liu Hanying, feeling unjustly suspected during his term of office, intends to resign.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>All Officers Stationed Along the Canal Dismissed: The Department of Civil Affairs has found that small canal boats have been repeatedly robbed due to the inadequate efforts of the public security officials in various counties. The Department specifically ordered Yan, the Sixth District Director of the Provincial Public Security Water Police Team, to dismiss all officers stationed along the canal. Director Yan has complied with the order and dismissed Sun Naitai, the captain of the 23rd team stationed at Xiannvmiao, and appointed Le Pengfei to replace him; Hu Shichang, the second platoon leader of the 25th team stationed at Xiematou, and appointed Fan Zhan'ao to replace him; Wang Hanbin, the platoon leader of the 23rd team stationed at Huojiaqiao, and appointed Du Youmin as acting leader; Xu Ziying, the patrolling officer stationed at Qingshuitan, and appointed Zhu Yaozhong as acting officer; and Mu Jincheng, the patrolling officer stationed at Wantou, and appointed Ding Chongqing to replace him.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Tongxiang Consolidated Tax Merged: The Jiaxing Consolidated Tax Bureau was previously ordered to merge the Jiashan Consolidated Tax Bureau into Jiaxing. Director Jiang carried out the merger and reorganization and reported to the province for record. It is now learned that the Tongxiang County Consolidated Tax Bureau, formerly under Jiaxing's jurisdiction, has also been ordered to be abolished, and all tax affairs will be handled by the Jiashan and Heshui Jiaxing bureaus. Director Jiang consulted with Director Xu of Jiaxing and reached an agreement to merge Puyuan, Doumen, and Qinglongqiao in Tongxiang into Jiaxing and Chongde Shiqiao, Tudan, Zhouquan, Lingan, and Tingzhiqiao into Heshui. They have scheduled a meeting for the 21st to take over the operations. Director Jiang has also appointed Tang Boying as the acting director of the Puyuan branch bureau, Tao Gancheng as the acting director of the Tongxiang (i.e., Qinglongqiao) branch bureau, and Zhu Zongzheng as the acting director of the Doumen patrol boat.</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Bonds Not Approved: The Jiaxing County Government, seeing that the rice fields had suffered successive years of poor harvests and that the people were destitute and the price of rice was very high, resolved at the first county administrative meeting to request the province to allocate 20,000 yuan in disaster relief bonds for price stabilization. The county government submitted the request to the province based on the resolution and organized a price stabilization committee to actively prepare. It is now learned that the requested funds were forwarded by the Civil Affairs Department to the Zhejiang Relief Association for review. The province has received a reply from the association stating that while the poor autumn harvest in the county is a fact, the situation is different from that in other counties receiving relief, and all counties that have requested funds for price stabilization have been instructed to raise the funds themselves. The same principle should apply to Jiaxing, and the county magistrate should be responsible for raising funds locally. The Civil Affairs Department approved the reply and has instructed the county to comply.</p>
<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Director of Civil Affairs Inspects Zhazha: Zhu Jiahua, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Zhejiang Province, arrived in Zhazha at around 5:00 PM on the 14th, accompanied by members of the Construction Committee. The visit was reportedly to inspect the newly built highway and the Oriental Grand Harbor. The visit was kept secret, and the agencies did not know the arrangements. Because of the hotel shortage, he spent the night in a railway station office. The next day, a car visited the Huangshan and Waipudong area and returned to Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Silkworm News: The county is a silkworm raising area. Farmers in the villages make their living by silkworm farming. This year, at the beginning of the silkworm season, the price of mulberry leaves rose to 3.6 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and then gradually fell to less than one yuan. In the neighboring Haiyan County, it fell to less than one yuan for several dan. The reason is that since the summer began, the weather has been cold and warm. The silkworms suddenly died, and most abandoned the practice. The amount of silkworm farming has decreased this year. Although the silk cocoon market is now open, the harvest is small.</p>
<p>Woman Arrested for Suspected Opium Smuggling: Gui Chang, an elderly woman in the western suburbs, is famous for soil selling. Recently, she shipped in opium worth 600 yuan from Shanghai. She had two-thirds of the opium. She was opening it in Minhang when the police investigated. They confiscated everything and detained the boat owner.</p>
<p>Suspects Escorted to the Provincial Capital: The provincial security team stationed in this city previously arrested the suspects Ma Sheng, Song Yusheng, Yao Herong, and Mao Ada in Xincang. They were escorted to the provincial capital yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Scheduled for Trial of Bandits: The security team has been suppressing bandits in Zhuji and has successively captured more than 20 criminals. Battalion Commander Chen Zhiban sent troops to escort them to the provincial capital. It is reported that the Security Department believes that the crimes committed by these bandits are serious and has scheduled a trial to obtain confessions. After their confessions, the suspects will be escorted back to the area where they committed their crimes for execution to serve as a warning. The Issue of Vehicle Licenses on the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway: The Zhejiang Construction Department and the Jiangsu Construction Department believe that the construction of the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway is about to be completed and will be open to traffic soon. The number of ordinary cars and other vehicles will inevitably increase daily. The issue of vehicle licenses during their operation will inevitably lead to conflicts. Officials have been sent to formulate a joint provincial traffic plan. After the plans are submitted to the respective departments for review and approved by the two provincial governments, they will be officially announced.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Cloth Industry Telegram Requesting Extension of Donation Ticket Deadline: Due to the current regulation that donation tickets for the Shaoxing cloth industry are only divided into three installments, with a deadline of only two months, the industry is experiencing difficulties and its future is greatly hindered. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to the Finance Department requesting that it order the cloth donation bureau to allow an unlimited period and number of installments.</p>
<p>Deliberating on the Establishment of Construction Bonds: Shaoxing has been tasked with raising 800,000 yuan in provincial construction bonds, with gentry and merchants equally responsible for the subscription. The amount to be raised from stores has been decided by the Chamber of Commerce. The amount to be raised from households will be determined by the fundraising committee and discussed at a temporary meeting on the 18th. The amount of shortage will then be raised from medium-sized stores with capital of 1,000 to 2,000 yuan at an amount of 12 yuan or 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>The First District Begins Price-Stabilized Grain Distribution: The First District, has been purchasing 2,000 stone (unit of volume) of Mai Rice from Shanghai. It has now been delivered. The district includes the old autonomous city and four regions (Ding, Xia, Da), and the distribution method is determined based on the population of each region. The River and Lake Relief Association specifies that the city area sell on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th days; the Dingzhai Street sell on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th days; and the Xiaguan and Daze areas sell on the 1st, 4th, and 7th days. The distribution period is 42 days, with three days as a unit. The civilians prepare the price and go to the sales with the grain purchase certificates issued by the village committee. The population of the household and the number of adults and children is written on the certificates, specifying one liter for each adult and half liter for each child.</p>
<p>Women's Association Sends Letter to the County for Investigation: Shen Changyan, a former teacher at Donghai Elementary School, was irresponsible in his love affair with Xu Qiuju (daughter of Xu Shangfu, a former school board member, 15 years old). Xu suffered a tragic childbirth on the night of December 28th of the Lunar Calendar (mother and child both died). Shen has disappeared since the incident. This matter was known by the Women's Association and a letter was sent to the county government for a thorough investigation. A few days ago, Zhou, an investigator, summoned Xu Shangfu, a related person of the case. He investigated the circumstances. Xu Shangfu has been doing his utmost to deny the affair. The investigator instructed that he should investigate and examine the coffin if the reports are correct.</p>
<h3>Hefei</h3>
<p>Details of the Bandit Den Cracked in the City: Robberies and murders have occurred in the city in recent months. Although the authorities have earnestly investigated and searched pedestrians, they have not been solved. Fang Zhishuo, the 21-year-old son of a local gentry Fang Xingqiao, who resides near Xiaodongmen, graduated from an art school in Shanghai and is skilled in painting. On the afternoon of the 9th, he took a birdcage and strolled on the city wall south of the city gate. Xu Guorong, a relative and owner of a timber shop, came to talk to him. Suddenly, a bandit approached and claimed to have a very good bird. They agreed to go to see it. Fang and Xu accompanied the bandit to the house of a Ding surnamed man in the vegetable garden east of the Public Girls' High School. The bandit pulled out a pistol and forced them to stop. He handcuffed their hands and feet and placed them in a pit made of adobe in the wing room, covered with a bed. In the evening, he threatened Fang Zhishuo to write a letter to his father by hand, asking him to prepare a 50,000 yuan ransom. Fang's family was shocked to receive the letter early on the 11th and immediately reported it to the county government. The county government sent detectives, found a local selling fried dough sticks had seen a handgun in the bandit den near the Public Girls' High School. The detective returned to report to Magistrate Wang. At 3:00 PM, Magistrate Wang led a militia, a merchant regiment, and a public security team to cut off traffic in the Xiaodongmen and Xiaonanmen area, set up sentries, and led police officers to the bandit den. The bandits fled over the wall after hearing the news, but two guards, Yang Xinyuan and Wang Fufa, were found. A pistol was also found. Fang and Xu were rescued from the pit and taken back for questioning. The bandit leader is from Hunan, with a mole on his face and a beard. The guard bandit provided the names of three bandit dens and said the person who plotted with the other bandits to kidnap Xu also conspired to kidnap Fang's son. This bandit's regular job was as a wood shed assistant. Magistrate Wang imprisoned Xu, Yang, and Wang. Fang's son was allowed to return home in the evening. A strict search continued on the 12th.</p>
<p>It was also learned that the bandit leader on the run, Zhang Huibai, had served as a mid-level officer under Zhang Zongchang. Xu Guorong, who had been arrested for plotting the kidnapping, had also served as a battalion commander. The two had a close relationship. After the defeat of the Zhilu Army, Zhang returned to his hometown of Yangzhou. Last winter, he came to Hefei to find Xu and set up a gambling club on the soil street south of Xiaonanmen, which soon closed. This spring, he rented Ding's house next to the Public Girls' High School and instigated Xu to kidnap the sons of various gentry and wealthy men in the city. Fang Zhishuo, the son of the Fang family in Xiaodongmen, had a personal relationship with Xu, so he was lured and kidnapped first. The letter sent to Fang's house on the 11th said that it had been mailed from Moziwan in the northern countryside and demanded a 50,000 yuan ransom. However, the glue on the envelope was not dry, so Magistrate Wang determined that the bandit tickets were all in the city and led a team to search, thus capturing them. On the afternoon of the 12th, Magistrate Wang sent a team to Xu's home, found more than a dozen Browning pistol bullets, and sealed Xu's house and the Hongshunxiang store outside the North Gate. Today (the 13th) at 2:00 PM, the mastermind Xu Guorong, the watchers, Yang Xinyuan and Wang Fufa, were taken out, paraded through the streets, and executed at the Weiya Daguan. Yesterday, the county government also executed Mei Pingxiang and Li Feiyou, two bandits from the Chaohu Water Police Bureau and the Forty Fort Brigade, who had been delivered to the county for kidnapping and killing the victim at the Cai Datang execution ground.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Report on Elementary Education Overview</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities to fill out and report the survey form on the overview of elementary education to the Ministry within one month. The order states that the three types of survey forms on the overview of elementary education, the statistical survey form on compulsory education, and the instructions for filling out the forms have been issued by the Ministry's Order No. 1851, hoping to learn the actual situation of elementary education and compulsory education in the country in the shortest possible time. However, half a year has passed, and the forms have not been reported to the Ministry. The end of the 18th academic year is approaching. It is hereby ordered that the survey form on the overview of elementary education be filled out and reported to the Ministry within one month without delay.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Submission of Various Separate Educational Laws and Regulations</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education orders the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities: All separate educational laws and regulations formulated by the educational administrative organs of each province and city are of great importance to the education of a province or a city. For the sake of review and comparison, the Ministry hereby orders that all current educational laws and regulations be submitted in duplicate within seven days of receipt of this document. This matter concerns review and should not be delayed.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders that Tables and Booklets Submitted for Review Should Be Carefully Examined</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education orders the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities that the tables and booklets reviewed should be strictly examined before being sent to the Ministry to save procedures. The order states that the tables and booklets regarding the establishment or registration of schools at all levels, which are reviewed and forwarded by the education departments of each province and the education bureaus of each special city, should be carefully examined by the respective departments and bureaus before being forwarded to the Ministry. Recently, it has been found that many of these tables and booklets do not comply with the regulations regarding students' admission qualifications and the experience of faculty and staff, and there are many other inconsistencies. The departments and bureaus have not reviewed them thoroughly and have forwarded them to the Ministry hastily. If there are any objections, the Ministry will return them to the original departments and bureaus for correction, which is detrimental to administrative efficiency. In the future, all tables and booklets submitted for review should be carefully examined first. Any points that do not comply with the regulations should be returned for correction. After re-examination and verification, they should be sent to the Ministry to save procedures. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued to the relevant departments and bureaus for their information.</p>

<h3>Retrospect of the Second National Education Conference (50)</h3>
<p>(II) Determination of the Principles of Central Government Subsidies for Education</p>
<p>(1) The original education funds of provinces, cities, and counties should still be allocated for the original education undertakings.</p>
<p>(2) Of the newly increased education tax revenue of provinces, cities, and counties, provinces should set aside 30% for compulsory education and adult literacy education funds, and cities and counties should set aside 80% for compulsory education and adult literacy education funds.</p>
<p>(3) When the compulsory education and adult literacy education funds of counties and cities are insufficient, the province should make up the amount.</p>
<p>(4) When the compulsory education and adult literacy education funds of provinces and special cities are insufficient, the central government should make up the amount.</p>
<p>(5) The central government's subsidies for compulsory education and adult literacy education funds should at least bear 45% of the total amount each year.</p>
<p>(6) When the central government's share of the aforementioned (1) and (2) types of income is insufficient, the Ministry of Finance should allocate it from the central government's general income.</p>
<p>(7) The compulsory education and adult literacy education funds allocated by the central government should be allocated in detail by the Ministry of Education according to the needs of each province, city, and county.</p>
<h3>(III) The Principle of Independent Education Funding</h3>
<p>Education funding should be guaranteed to be independent, which is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teaching. According to the principle of independent education funding, a special accounting system should be adopted. Once the local tax revenue designated for education funding is determined, it cannot be used for other purposes. Once the central tax revenue designated for education funding is determined, it cannot be used for other purposes either.</p>
<h3>(IV) General Budget of the Entire Plan</h3>
<p>Detailed figures of the required funds for each program have been seen in this newspaper on April 25, 26, and 27, so they will not be repeated here. Only the total estimated amount of each program for four years is listed and summarized. According to the table, the total amount of education funds for the next 20 years is 528,663,000 yuan, of which 80.4% is for elementary compulsory education, 13.6% is for social education and literacy training, 4.0% is for secondary education, 1.2% is for higher education, 0.5% is for Mongolian and Tibetan education, and 0.3% is for overseas Chinese education.</p>

<h3>One Man's Opinion Autumn Waters</h3>
<p>Women love any strand of hair on a man's head. But the hair found on the lapel of his outer coat, she definitely won't love.</p>
<p>Men can calmly and bravely face thugs with guns ready to fire. But at the slightest hint of a sneer from any woman, he'll flee like a frightened deer.</p>
<p>A woman's love is immortal, unless she's tired of forgiving her man and wants to forget him.</p>
<p>A woman who has managed a household for several years, empty promises and lies can be said to be her second nature... If she doesn't conceal the total amount she has squandered from her impoverished husband, she will falsely claim to have saved some money in front of her wealthy husband.</p>
<p>Courting is a strange art. A young man under twenty obviously has a natural talent for it, but many seasoned people never acquire even a smattering of the art of courtship.</p>
<p>Spring is to an unmarried man like a new exhilarating drug, a source of new romance. But for a married man, it's just the time to prevent flies and change curtains.</p>
<p>Jealousy is a magnifying glass. A jealous woman can turn two plus two into twenty-four.</p>
<p>The sacred commandment "Thou shalt not steal" can be observed by almost every man of stature. But it doesn't apply to an umbrella, a kiss, a monetary gift, a hotel towel, or another man's lover.</p>
<p>Women, please give your men a little longer leash. But never let him forget that you are still holding tightly to the other end of the rope.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Saigon · Xu · Tu · Qi</h3>
<p>Saigon is located between Hong Kong and Singapore, and is a major city in Vietnam. The land was originally our country's old territory. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, it has established counties and sent envoys to pay tribute without interruption for years. Until the Qing dynasty, the Sino-French conflict arose, and it became a colony. This is my first visit, and I have endless feelings. I will record its outline to inform the people of the country. After nineteen bends along the Mekong River, we arrived at Dike. The land is in the tropics, and the climate is extremely hot. I boarded the ship in Shanghai, wearing a lined coat and still feeling the cold. Upon arriving here, I was sweating like rain. There is a difference of three months in just one week. The whole year is divided into dry and rainy seasons. From November to April, there is almost no rain, and it is unusually dry. From May to October, there is a lot of rainfall, making it easy to cultivate. The land is fertile and produces abundant rice. The locals are accustomed to wearing single garments and going barefoot, regardless of gender. Due to the climate, they are accustomed to laziness and are slow to act. The great time is mostly wasted in sleep. Is this the reason for the downfall?</p>
<p>The French regard Vietnam as an important place for defense in the Far East. They have worked hard and made active efforts. The bridges and buildings are well-organized, the forests are lush, and the rails run horizontally and vertically. This kind of garden-like city can represent the French spirit of loving art. It is similar to the British management of Hong Kong. Each pursues their own preferences. Looking back at China, can we not feel regret?</p>
<p>The Vietnamese government treats overseas Chinese extremely harshly. In addition to paying 15 yuan for import tax upon entry, they must also pay an annual head tax of 50 yuan. Those engaged in commerce also have a so-called license tax, which is levied in every possible way. Recently, regulations have been promulgated to suppress Chinese businessmen. From May 1st of this year, all those who pay an annual license tax of more than 500 yuan must use French bookkeeping. The implementation of this kind of high-handed measure is even worse than the treatment of the native Vietnamese. This time, Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Chinese government, passed through Saigon. The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce specially requested him to convey the message to Minister Gao, who was stationed in France, and directly negotiate with the French government to argue on the basis of reason in order to help the overseas Chinese. Saigon's education is purely controlled by the French and lacks independent spirit. The largest schools are two. One is the Sino-French School, Lycee Franco Chinois, and the other is the Annam School, Lycee Petru. French is the main language, and Chinese is the auxiliary language. The training of special colonial education is self-defeating.</p>
<p>The Jordin Botanique Botanical Garden covers hundreds of acres and is magnificent in scale. The trees planted are of various kinds. The banyan trees are winding and swaying, and the palm trees are tall and umbrella-like. The exotic flowers and rare herbs have a special charm. The prosperity of tropical plants shows no difference between winter and summer. Pine and cypress are known only after the cold season, which is not something to be discussed here. There are also many animals in the garden, such as tigers, leopards, bears, elephants, etc., enclosed by iron railings. Apart from crocodiles, no other aquatic species have been seen. Tame elephants can understand human intentions. Their noses often extend out, seeming to beg for food. If you throw in a copper coin, they will curl it up and put it in their noses, then transfer it to the gatekeeper to exchange for bananas and sugarcane to satisfy their hunger.</p>
<p>Among the magnificent buildings in Saigon, as far as I have traveled, the French Theater and the Governor's Palace are the most beautiful. The carvings are exquisite, and the wall decorations are elegant. Compared to those in Shanghai, few can match them. The outstanding streets are Rue Catinat, Rue d'Annam, Rue des Marins, Rue du Gouverneur Général, Boulevard de Norodom, and Rue de Paris. I wandered around with Manhua in a car, and the fleeting scenes are difficult to recall. There are four Chinese newspapers: the Chinese Daily, the Qunbao, the South China Overseas Chinese Daily, and the Republic Daily. Freedom of speech is extremely limited. They are interfered with by the local government everywhere. On days when government agencies are closed, there is no right to publish without manuscript inspection. (Publication is suspended every Sunday because there is no manuscript inspection.) France calls itself a democratic and advanced country to the world, sacrificing hundreds of millions of people to fight for freedom. Now, it imposes what it does not want on others and even goes further to shackle and destroy them. Can Madame Roland rest in peace?</p>

<p>Shanghai, because of its status as a treaty port,</p>
<p>and with the efforts of foreigners, has developed day by day, even though the interior is poor and chaotic. Not to mention anything else, let's talk about the buildings I've seen in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the tallest buildings in Shanghai were only six or seven stories high. At that time, the most prominent were Sincere and Wing On. Now, tall buildings on the Great Road are emerging one after another. For example, Wah An Company and Sassoon House are not only tall, but also grand and magnificent. Countless houses in the city have changed their facades and been renovated. Each renovation always shows significant progress.</p>
<p>Speaking of the tallest building in Shanghai, it's probably the building near Avenue Sainte Marie. That building is about fifteen stories high. Currently, there are probably no taller ones. I heard that it is entirely apartments. The apartment business is developing extremely rapidly because it is affordable and convenient, so small families avoid the hassle of renting houses and live in apartments. Besides this, recently a nine-story building has also been built at the end of Avenue Haig and Avenue Joffre. The inside is truly extremely luxurious. At the same time, there is also a seven-story apartment at the intersection of Route Ferguson, which is invested by the American Savings Association. From this, it can be seen that the residences of modern urban people are mostly far from the city, and tall buildings are increasingly favored by investors.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the Xujiahui area was still a wasteland. There were only a few dilapidated shops in the city. But now, the city has changed. The houses are lined up one after another. There are countless Western-style houses under construction. In short, it has been transformed from a wasteland to a beautifully decorated place. Therefore, according to our observation, the Shanghai market is gradually developing, and the demand for land is increasing day by day. The price in the future will also gradually rise. At this time, the deserted Hongqiao Road and Great West Road will definitely become the center of residence in the future, so invest in</p>
<h3>A Record of Re-visiting the Summer Palace by Chen Jiaqing</h3>
<p>In the year of Wuchen, on the sixteenth day of the second month, teachers and students of the National Academy visited the Summer Palace together. The palace was built by Empress Dowager Cixi of the Qing Dynasty with four million taels of navy funds. It is magnificent and luxurious, reaching the extreme of extravagance. On the Shangsi Festival in the year of Dingmao, I and Chengyu held a wedding ceremony in the Hall of Benevolence and Longevity in the palace. This visit is a re-visit. The wind pavilions and waterside pavilions add to the pleasantness. Therefore, I will briefly record the places I have visited.</p>
<p>The palace is built against the mountain, with a circumference of ten li. Ten thousand households and thousands of doors cannot exhaust its beauty. Walking circuitously, we reached the Hall of Dispelling Clouds and ascended the Tower of Buddhist Fragrance. The vermilion railings surround each other, and the stone steps spiral upwards. Among them, coral is used for railings, and emerald is used for lattices. The towering palaces seem to connect to the sky. The golden plate for receiving dew might attract immortal envoys, but the Old Buddha has gone. (In the palace, Cixi was called the Old Buddha.) The Buddhist temple is dilapidated, and no one worships. The incense has been cut off. Leaning on the railing for a short rest, facing the bright sky. The mirror of heaven falls into my eyes, and my heart is like a clear pool. Long clouds roll in the sky, and the top and bottom are a clear blue. The pure air is not contaminated, and there are very few boats. The gulls and egrets are not suspicious, and can replace the hermit fisherman. Descending the steps, we turned to the back of Longevity Hill. Mountain birds please people, and ridge clouds delight me. Sunny hills occasionally rise, and secluded paths suddenly diverge. Weak grass brushes the skirt, and horizontal branches block the sun. Pine flowers dot the green, and willow shadows shake gold. The scenery is quiet, and the hills and valleys are exquisite. Everyone empties what they carry and eats on the ground. At this time, the flower fragrance is warm, fish play in the duckweed, the fragrance of wine is scattered, and birds peek at the wine vessels. After being drunk and full, we walked down the mountain to the Garden of Harmonious Interest. Greenery embraces the front of the curtain, and wind greets the stone. Tall bamboos reach the sky, and weeping willows dip into the water. A clear stream is like a silk ribbon, and melting snow seems to flow. A green pool forms a ring, and the inverted image can be scooped up. Further west, we reached the Hall of Joyful Longevity. The water and wood are clear and beautiful, and the rooms are spacious and bright. Inside is a painting of Empress Dowager Cixi when she was young. The atmosphere is majestic, and her eyebrows are heroic and unparalleled. After Wu Zetian, she is the only one. However, her hegemonic map has fallen, and wealth and glory have declined. White clouds over the Jade Pool, look in vain for the Queen Mother. Pine and cypress trees and simple rice meals, who will offer them at the ancestral tombs? The rise and fall of thousands of years are all the same. We took a boat and reached the Temple of the Dragon King. The misty Yingzhou is on the other side of the water. It is as if there are hidden dragons playing at the bottom of the waves. Men and women came together, washing their skirts and leaving. We then landed on the shore from the Seventeen-Arch Bridge. To the south is the Spring Knowing Pavilion, with lush green grass and clear, rippling waves. It is as if we are in a painting. Heading north, we passed the Fish Joy Pavilion. The scenery is extremely secluded. Looking down from the railing at the fish, the wind moves the duckweed and opens it up. They come and go leisurely, as if they do not know that there are exiled people who ended their lives by jumping into the water. Alas, silent fragrant grass, who remembers the prince? Tearful cuckoos, sadly mourning the emperor's son. Chang Hong turned into jade, unable to remedy the declining Zhou Dynasty. Hong Yan剖肝, what good is it for the dying Wei Dynasty? Leaning on the railing to mourn, I was saddened for a long time. After a while, we crossed the lake. There is a bronze ox on the shore. I don't know how many years it has been through the cold and heat. Alas, the golden people ascended to the throne, able to speak of Maoling. Copper camels in the thorns, who knows the Dynasty of Jin? Remembering last year's visit, my niece Ruisheng once playfully rode on the back of the ox, pretending to be a shepherd boy playing the flute. Time flies, and another year has passed in an instant. Passing through the Hall of Jade Ripples, the royal carriage is long gone. The cart path is covered with moss. The golden palace still exists, but the red steps are covered with moss. Spider webs are on the eaves, and dust has accumulated on the railings. Sighing at the rise and fall, it is suddenly dawn and dusk. The mulberry fields can shift, and luxury is easy to pass. What does not change with the world is only the smoke and haze. Touching this detached palace, I cannot help but feel a thousand emotions. Further north, we took a short rest at the Qingyan Boat. Looking around from the window, fragrant orchids fill the shore, and colorful greenery surrounds the forest. A gentle breeze does not stir the waves, and the wind flowers want to dance. The boat is carved with stone and will forever suppress the center of the lake. The pavilion stands on the peak, towering above the clouds. The divine craftsmanship is perfect, and the embellishments are all appropriate. Such gardens and forests are truly magnificent. Already, the setting sun is in the mountains, and the shadows of people are scattered. The roosting birds return to the forest, and my excitement has also ended. Alas, the lake and mountains are like paintings, gold powder flows fragrance, wax clogs revisit. How many times is there in life, especially when the flames of war are connected to the sky and easily feel the ashes of calamity. There is no pure land in thousands of miles of dust. Climbing high and looking at Chu, I am ashamed of the lack of talent for writing poems. Carrying my books from my teacher, I dare to let the pen of benevolence be used. Therefore, I use paper and ink to leave a snow goose. The tune is matched to Taicheng Road: The clear waves of thousands of acres open the mirror, and the jade forest meets the flower affairs again. The Jade Mother's royal tour, the Eastern Emperor's imperial banquet, the songs and dances of the annual gatherings, intoxicated by gold and paper, watch the immortal palace towering and the fragrance flying, the thousand-fold bright corridors, most pity the palace servants who personally serve. (Every time Cixi ascended the Tower of Buddhist Fragrance, she would have a Fujin attend the imperial carriage.) The prosperity should sigh a dream, after the Dragon went to Dinghu, they all changed the world. The eunuchs cried hungry, and the remaining people jumped into the sea. How many times have people offered thoughts? The lake and mountains are full of green, let the wax clogs revisit, the painted boat is closed, don't let spring return, the cuckoo still carries tears.</p>
<p>In that kind of place, the results can be impressive in less than ten years. It's more secure than buying government bonds and stocks.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Four Books Lesson · Lian · Weng</h3>
<p>In a certain abandoned temple in the western corner of Shanghai, there is an old man who calls himself the "Ten Imperfections Old Man," living with an old monk. The old man is from Yunnan and once served as an official in Jiangsu. After the dynastic upheaval, he has lived in Shanghai for more than ten years. His family members have mostly died, and his official purse is empty. He now makes a living by teaching the Four Books, charging four corners per lesson. He gives two lessons a day, and then goes out to buy drinks. However, he is able to make strange predictions, so people flock to him like ducks.</p>
<p>The old man lives in the west corridor of the temple. In the room hangs a portrait of Confucius. After getting up at dawn, if there are people outside the door, he will wash, burn incense, and then take out six copies of the Four Books and a divination tube containing copper coins. After shaking it three times, he pours it onto the table. If it shows one yang and five yin, it is the first book, the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean. Shaking it again, he gets the section number. Shaking it again, he gets the question number. He takes passages out of context to determine everything. He closes the room after ten o'clock in the morning. A certain woman lost her engagement ring and came to divine. She got the sentence "it is in the between," and indeed found it under the cushion in the car. A certain gentleman came to divine about his illness and got the sentence "his disease will not be cured." The disease instead healed. The old man said, "This is only the illness of the liver and phlegm not being cured. What harm can other diseases do?" When drunk, he constantly told people, but no one knows his name.</p>
<p>The old man also said that in his middle age, he went to Tianjin by sea via the Grand Canal. In the wheelhouse, he met an old man who taught him the divination method. However, he has lost the book of songs and incantations. He is concerned that those who are in the business cannot pass it on, and those who can pass it on are unwilling to learn, so it will probably be lost. The person on Jing'an Road dancing drunkenly by the Yingtianquan well is this old man. Women and children all know him, but only call him Mr. Ten Imperfections.</p>

<p>Chapter Eleven: Cui Luo and Zhu Qiao, a Beautiful Woman Returns to a Fine Gentleman, a Blue Tent and a Crimson Canopy, a Famous Courtesan Marries into a Prominent Family</p>
<p>If someone else's translation is not used, they would naturally be unhappy, but they wouldn't fly into a rage. However, in the future, they wouldn't be happy to translate lengthy works. But Liu Xingshu, after getting angry today, couldn't even sleep. This alone shows that he has some symptoms of illness and is proof that he is prone to anger. But he has an inherently honest nature. The second time, when he saw relevant papers, he still wanted to translate them. If his translation was deleted and published, he would still get angry. Later, they agreed on a method: first ask if it could be published. If it couldn't be published, then he wouldn't bother translating it. However, he was still displeased in his heart. This was only regarding the morning newspaper. As for the evening newspaper, a few news items were always sure to be published. In addition, there was the Reuters telegram. Now, someone translates this Reuters telegram and sends it to the newspaper offices. It wasn't done this way before. The Western original was sent to the newspaper office, and the translators in their newspaper office translated it themselves. Therefore, Liu Xingshu couldn't leave the newspaper office very early. He had to wait for the evening newspaper and the Reuters telegrams to arrive before he could translate them and leave. The earliest he could leave was probably ten o'clock at night. The salaries for these two jobs added up to 150 yuan from the bookstore. That was considered the best treatment. The editor-in-chief was only 200 yuan. He was only in charge of a part of the translation, which was also giving face to a master's degree from the United States. The translation job in the newspaper office was actually only a few hours of work, and the monthly salary was 100 yuan. It wasn't considered meager at the time. However, the two places combined were still less than 300 yuan. Although Xingshu has been very frugal recently and hardly spends any money, for the sake of saving money, he only saves a little over 200 yuan a month. Saving for ten months is only over 2,000 yuan, which is still less than half of his budgeted wedding expenses. Moreover, his auspicious day has already been chosen in August of the second half of the year, so he can't wait those ten months. At this moment, a bookstore wanted to print a kind of detective novel. That kind of detective novel was to be translated from an English book. It had over 300,000 words. They were willing to pay 1,000 yuan. Liu Xingshu thought, "I can do this job. Translating novels is not like translating academic books, which have difficult theories. Moreover, I saw some of those detective novels when I was studying in the United States. Translating them is not very difficult. It can probably be completed in three or four months. This is an extra income. 1,000 yuan is not a small supplement. In short, the expenses for the wedding banquet must be sufficient and will definitely not be insufficient." Therefore, he took on this job. After taking on the job, he happily said to Zuo Shichen, "Today, I took on a job for 1,000 yuan, and I plan to complete it in three months."</p>

<h3>Drastic Changes in the Gold Market Last Week</h3>
<p>Highest 526.8 Taels</p>
<p>Lowest 501 Taels</p>
<p>Taxation Temporarily Postponed, Hopes for a Rise</p>
<p>The fluctuations in gold prices at auction last week were very drastic. Such volatility had not been seen since the major changes in February of this year. It almost immediately experienced an unprecedented new high price during this exchange period, reaching 526 taels and 8 mace. This was due to the extreme tightness of foreign exchange settlements and substantial sums involved, the significant decline in large-denomination silver, and the strong buying interest from banks, coupled with the eagerness of major short-sellers to cover their positions. Unexpectedly, on the 16th, with the exchange period approaching, the National Government suddenly issued an order prohibiting the export of cash, imposed import taxes on silver bullion, and banned the import of Mexican silver coins, causing widespread panic. This was like a bolt from the blue, leading major holders to rush to sell, greatly impacting general long positions. Short-sellers were overjoyed, and the price plummeted, dropping more than 20 taels, a truly drastic reaction. It suddenly fell to 501 taels. The next day, due to the National Government temporarily suspending taxation on silver and Japan's protest against the ban on cash exports, confidence turned optimistic, and the price suddenly rose by 10 taels. Hengxing, Shengda, and others aggressively covered their positions. However, these six days were extremely turbulent, and the future gold market may not fall to a low point. It is possible that new highs will be seen again. The general situation from Monday to the weekend is detailed below:</p>
<p>Monday (12th): Both large-denomination silver and the foreign exchange market contracted. The gold market initially strengthened but then weakened, likely due to major holders divesting. The market opened at 517 taels and 4 mace in the morning, then 519 taels, and finally 516 taels. It was expected to break through the 520-tael barrier the next day. There were fluctuations on Wednesday, with active selling. The market situation changed slightly the following day, and an unprecedented high price of 526 taels and 8 mace was recorded. Friday (16th) coincided with the exchange period. Reports of the National Government's ban on cash exports spread to the market, causing widespread panic. The market was extremely chaotic, with fluctuations of up to 19 taels. The July market opened at 520 taels, then suddenly dropped to 501 taels, before recovering to 517.5 taels, and finally closing at 508 taels. Large-denomination silver remained low, and the foreign exchange market was inconsistent. Most Chinese merchants were selling off. As for the exchange period, long positions initially increased but then reversed. The sense of anxiety was indescribable. Although large-denomination silver rose on Saturday, it did not have a significant impact. The gold market reversed upwards as news of the temporary suspension of silver taxation spread, boosting confidence and leading to a 10-tael increase. The difference between the highest and lowest prices during the week was slightly less than 26 taels. The high and low prices of English, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as exchange auction prices, are listed below:</p>

<p>Large Silver (Nearby) 19 3125 Pence 19 Pence   Decreased by 0.125</p>

<h3>Sudden Decline in British and American Silver Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's London telegram reported a renewed decline in the price of large silver, with the near-term price decreasing by 0.25 to 19 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling and 10.4375 pence in British gold) and the forward price decreasing by 0.25 to 18.9375 pence.

<h3>Bond Prices Unanimously Rose Last Week</h3>
<p>Transactions Exceeded 47 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, the bond market in this port saw very quiet spot trading. Only 110,000 yuan worth of transactions were recorded for the entire week, including 36,000 yuan in Reorganization Bonds, 21,000 yuan in Disaster Relief Bonds, 15,000 yuan in Sixth-Year Bonds, 10,500 yuan in Rehabilitation Bonds, 9,500 yuan in Financial Bonds, 6,000 yuan in Continued Bonds, 5,000 yuan in Customs Bonds, 4,000 yuan in Continued Big Bonds, and 1,000 yuan each in Seventh-Year Bonds, Disarmament Bonds, and Cigarette Bonds. The futures market was more active than the previous week, with lively trading throughout the week. Transactions reached over 10.1 million yuan on Wednesday, 8 to 9 million yuan on Tuesday and Thursday, 7.4 million yuan on Friday, and 5.8 to 5.9 million yuan on the first and last days of the week. Total transactions for the week reached 47.39 million yuan, exceeding the previous week by over 13 million yuan. Reorganization Bonds saw the fastest progress, with transactions exceeding those of Customs Bonds. Transactions for May delivery reached 5.13 million yuan, and for June delivery, 8.95 million yuan, more than double the previous week. Customs Bonds saw 6.005 million yuan in transactions for May delivery and 7.37 million yuan for June delivery. Disarmament Bonds saw 1.37 million yuan in transactions for May delivery and 3.095 million yuan for June delivery. Sixth-Year and Rehabilitation Bonds did not perform as well as before. Sixth-Year Bonds saw 1.855 million yuan in transactions for May delivery and 2.855 million yuan for June delivery. Rehabilitation Bonds saw 2.055 million yuan in transactions for May delivery and 2.02 million yuan for June delivery. Other bonds, including those for Pacification, saw 1.52 million yuan in transactions for May delivery and 1.09 million yuan for June delivery for Continued Bonds, 720,000 yuan for May delivery and 740,000 yuan for June delivery for Continued Two-Five Bonds, 810,000 yuan for May delivery and 850,000 yuan for June delivery for 96 Public Bonds, 375,000 yuan for May delivery and 160,000 yuan for June delivery for Financial Bonds, and 215,000 yuan for May delivery and 5,000 yuan for June delivery for Seventh-Year Bonds. As for the price fluctuations of various bonds last week, in the first half of the week, due to optimistic views on the current situation, the bond market environment improved, and investment buying was quite active. Demand exceeded supply, and buyers consistently held the upper hand. All bonds rose unanimously compared to the previous week. On Monday, Reorganization and Disarmament Bonds continued to rise by over one yuan, while others rose by about half a yuan. On Tuesday, Customs Bonds rose by 1.4 yuan, Disarmament Bonds rose again by one yuan, and others rose by 0.3 to 0.7 yuan. Buying interest was strongest on Wednesday, and the price increases were most significant. Disarmament Bonds continued to rise by over two yuan, and Seventh-Year, Sixth-Year, Customs, and Reorganization Bonds also rose by 1.3 to 1.4 yuan. However, Continued Two-Five, Rehabilitation, and Continued Bonds only improved by a few jiao, and the bullish sentiment was unprecedented. Subsequently, the prices of all bonds had risen significantly, and the strength of buyers weakened slightly, leading to a slight balance between supply and demand. The bond prices then stabilized and did not see significant fluctuations until the end of the week. As a result, spot and futures prices for Customs Bonds and spot prices for Reorganization Bonds rose by over three yuan compared to the previous week, while others rose by about one to two yuan. A statistical table of the high and low prices and increases and decreases of various bonds during the week is listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market and Futures Both Sluggish Last Week</h3>
<p>The yarn market has been unremarkable throughout the week, with an unusually sluggish situation. Even the three major overseas yarn products have seen sharp declines. The yarn market in this port has been held tightly by buyers, and the market has been able to maintain itself for the time being. However, with the unstable situation and the chaos of war, sales from all parties have been severely affected, resulting in a very depressed business. Chao Dai Dafeng Company has extremely low intentions and no desire to create a short squeeze. Both sides are holding their positions without moving, and the market price has fluctuated very little. Outsiders who see this stalemate are also helpless, so transactions have become increasingly scarce and the market situation is changing. If yarn sales decrease, inventory will inevitably increase, and the future is likely to change. According to statistics, all groups bought a total of 5,840 bales this week (however, the amount of exports is difficult to fully understand in the market, as some factories ship directly, and the number of bales is unknown. Future reports from customs will be used for reference). Fellow traders bought 1,250 bales. The market price for Japanese yarn has fallen by 0.05 to 0.1 tael, while local yarn has fallen by 0.05 to 0.07 tael. The Exchange's marked yarn has been unremarkable, with a decline of 0.03 to 0.04 tael for each month compared to the previous week. Total transactions for the week were only 36,300 bales. Osaka's three major yarn products have seen an uncontrollable decline due to the sharp decline in exchange rates and financial chaos. The amounts purchased by each group are listed below:</p>

<h3>Arrival, Sales, and Transaction Volume of Cotton Last Week</h3>
<p>Hankou Standard: 94,000 Loads Traded</p>
<p>Dock Arrivals: 3,650 Bales</p>
<p>Doing Business: 4,340 Loads</p>
<p>The cotton market remained in a state of fluctuation last week. The trend of American cotton was bleak and dull, so local confidence was also weak and the cotton market lacked vitality. Local factories had no transactions in spot cotton and most had already absorbed Indian cotton, so there was no need to purchase local cotton, and demand was cut off. In addition, the amount of machine-ginned cotton taken in from Dongmian last month reached 230,000 loads. Given the lack of sales, it had to be hedged in the May contract for delivery. It is said that there are also more than 20,000 loads of Hankou cotton stored. Although the intention of doing more business for Hankou is strong, the stagnation of consumption also presents a stalemate. It is said that there are still more than 70,000 loads of marked cotton in storage this month. Most of the buyers are from Hankou and retail investors, so it is expected that there will be some activity in the coming week. In addition, the price of near-month marked cotton is similar to the previous week, while the far-month price has increased by 0.025 tael. Total transactions for the week were 94,000 loads. Sources at the dock included 2,600 bales of Yao flower and 1,050 bales of Tong flower. Various manufacturers took in only 880 loads of spot cotton, and firms took in 3,460 loads. American cotton remained unchanged from the previous week. The volume purchased by various firms and manufacturers is listed below.</p>
<p>Manufacturer  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Volume Traded  Terms</p>
<p>Shaanxi Flower 36.35  --- 200 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Nanshi Flower 34.50  --- 100 Bales Again and Again</p>
<p>Firm Intake</p>

<p>Tongzhou Flower 36.00  --- 100 Bales Again and Again</p>
<h3>Slight Increase in American, British, and Indian Cotton Market Telegrams</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially softened due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but then strengthened due to excessive rainfall and poor eastern forecasts. Futures prices rose or fell by 1 to 5 points, while spot prices remained unchanged. British cotton futures rose by 1 point, and spot prices rose by 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices remained unchanged. The Indian cotton market was quiet and stable, with near and distant terms for Pingguo'er rising by 4 rupees, Aomula rising by 4 rupees, distant terms rising by 2 rupees, Piluoxi rising by 3 rupees, and distant terms rising by 4 rupees. The original telegram is recorded to the left (telegram dated 17th):</p>

<h3>World Cotton Publicity Week</h3>
<p>International Federation of Cotton Manufacturers Sends Circular to All Countries for Simultaneous Celebration</p>
<p>This Year: Week of July 7th to 12th</p>
<p>Manchester Report: The United Kingdom has designated the week of July 7th to 12th, 1930 as National Cotton Promotion Week, named Cotton Week. During this week, cotton mills will hold worker dances, and all men and women attending the event must wear cotton clothing. Numerous prizes will be awarded to the best-dressed. At the same time, local stores and groups will display complete cotton goods and organize parades of men and women dressed in various cotton fabrics, or hold various gatherings to promote cotton. The International Federation of Cotton Textile Manufacturers has sent a circular to its members in all countries, requesting that they hold similar promotions on the same date so that it can become World Cotton Promotion Week.</p>
<h3>Grain: River Lower Rice Market Remains Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of supply to Zhabei was increasingly scarce and can be said to have disappeared, while river stocks were gradually thinning. Buyers in this street, witnessing this situation, did not dare to take action and remained in a wait-and-see attitude. This was because the price of Shanghai White Japonica Rice fell less and rose more. For example, at the beginning of last week, the price gradually decreased day by day, but after some activity, the price immediately rose and even felt higher than the drop. As a result, shops and guest brokers all switched to buying imported rice to cope with retail sales. As for northern Japonica rice, they only bought selectively, so transactions were very quiet. High-grade rice remained stagnant. Bo Dao rice was not a popular product, but consumption is currently poor and no one is interested. Although arrivals were scarce, the market price tended to soften slightly. Only high-grade goods barely maintained the original price. Stocks of Yangjian River were also depleted, and Duzi was even thinner. Unfortunately, sales were not smooth, so the market price was cut by buyers in the evening session the day before yesterday. However, by yesterday's market, the situation tended to stabilize. Bianyuan guest brokers continued to select and purchase, and the price remained stable due to the scarcity of goods. Transactions of Yinyuan were rare, and the volume of transactions for the whole day was very small. The general market for all goods was unremarkable.</p>
<p>In the South Shanghai River, the number of ships arriving was dwindling. Due to the mismatch between prices in the western production areas and the Shanghai market, traders mostly changed their sales to other ports or changed their plans to avoid losses. As a result, the amount of Ji Geng rice from Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Tongxiang arriving at the port decreased daily. Shops and businesses either imported foreign rice or directly ordered from Xiang Road. Therefore, arrivals and sales both tended to be quiet, and prices remained stagnant. Although the market situation here was more moderate and predictable than in Zhabei, the sentiment and atmosphere were generally the same. Buying interest was only slightly active in small retail sales throughout the day, and there was no hope of progress. Merchants did not dare to ship too much Bo Dao, Early Rice, and Late Rice from Nanlu Township and other places to Shanghai because sales in Shanghai were not good and costs were also high. They also watched with their hands in their pockets. Therefore, the goods are now numb and depressed. Although there was no change in the market price, transactions were extremely small. The Ningbo importers were also very picky, and the market price was subtly cut by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. Yang Dujian's removal was sluggish and stagnant, and all parties did not pay much attention to the price. There was no rise or fall. Baiyuan's entry and exit varied slightly, and sales were sometimes smooth and sometimes stagnant, making the market price slightly more active.</p>
<h3>Marine Products: Pepper Plummets by 10 Taels</h3>
<p>Black and white pepper is in the greatest need from customers during the winter, with spring and autumn second. Currently it is summer, sales have passed the peak, and the prices in the production area are falling with each telegraph, and the firms have large stockpiles of goods in hand, making the market sentiment soft, so the market price has plummeted. Yesterday, the price of silver white pepper opened at 91 taels and black pepper at 57.5 taels. Compared to the market price ten days ago, each grade has fallen by more than 10 taels. The firms, seeing the sluggish customer sales, generally did not dare to buy, so the main players were inactive. The firm's goods wanted to be sold but there was no buyer, so there was little hope of a turnaround in the market trend for the time being.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Hankou Tung Oil Price Reported to be Plummeting</h3>
<p>Since the Hankou telegraph reported that the price of white tung oil sold to foreign merchants was 23.8 taels last week, the market has become even more depressed. Recent telegrams have reported that foreign merchants have bought 400 to 500 tons, and the price has fallen to 21.42 taels, which can be described as a decline. In addition, the Southern Branch reported a price of 20.08 taels and Sichuan tung oil reported a price of 21.6 taels, both customer prices. Zhejiang's West oil is still priced at slightly more than 33 yuan for Jiangjiao delivery. Comparing the two, Hankou tung oil is gradually becoming more cost-effective, and it is feared that the public's attention will gradually shift from south to north. The current drop in Hankou tung oil to this level is unprecedented in the past five or six years, and it is also a change in the market.</p>

<h3>Chen Qimei</h3>
<p>Martyrdom Memorial Meeting</p>
<p>Held in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Over 700 Representatives from Various Circles Attended</p>
<p>Yesterday (18th) was the 14th anniversary of the martyrdom of revolutionary martyr Mr. Chen Qimei. The Shanghai May Revolution Memorial Festival Preparatory Committee had made preparations in advance for a grand memorial, and informed various circles to send representatives to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to hold a memorial meeting. At the appointed time, more than 700 representatives from various circles arrived, and the hall was filled with people. Chen Dezheng gave the opening address, and Lu Wenqiao delivered a speech, detailing the great spirit of martyr Chen, which was tragic and impassioned. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. The details are recorded separately below. Chairman's Report: Chairman Chen Dezheng gave the opening address, saying, "Today is the anniversary of Mr. Chen Qimei's martyrdom. We know that today, in addition to this memorial meeting, there are two other large-scale ceremonies: one is the groundbreaking ceremony for the Chen Qimei Memorial Tower, and the other is the foundation stone laying ceremony for Mr. Chen Qimei's bronze statue this afternoon. Why do we so solemnly commemorate Mr. Chen Qimei? Mr. Chen Qimei began to engage in revolution at a very early age, when he was only 15 or 16 years old, until he was assassinated at the age of 41 by assassins sent by Yuan Shikai. Two things about Mr. Chen Qimei's life are most unforgettable to us: one is his help in the Xinhai Revolution, his increase in revolutionary power, and his great revolutionary performance, which completed a major stage of the revolution; and the other is that when Yuan Shikai wanted to expand his feudal power and consolidate his feudal foundation, Mr. Chen Qimei rose up to lead the Second Revolution. Although the Second Revolution failed, its value is indelible in the history of the revolution. These are two clear and great works that are worthy of our eternal commemoration. We know that after the Xinhai Revolution, many comrades did not sincerely believe in the Premier, but Mr. Chen Qimei was the only one who consistently believed in and followed the Premier. Therefore, we feel that this point is even more valuable. So when we commemorate Mr. Chen Qimei, we are not necessarily commemorating his achievements, but especially his spirit. There are three points in commemorating Mr. Chen Qimei's spirit: (1) Mr. Chen Qimei never compromised throughout his life; (2) Mr. Chen Qimei also had a spirit of fearlessness; (3) A spirit of learning from good. Now we should make a resolution, vow to sacrifice for the Party, and fight for the Party. No matter what difficulties come our way, we must persevere and do it. Under the current situation in China, if we compromise with the counter-revolutionary elements and do not eliminate the counter-revolutionary elements in one go, the future disasters may be even greater. Today, when commemorating Mr. Chen Qimei, what we must not forget is to repeatedly remember the lessons learned from the commemoration and do it diligently."</p>
<p>Representatives Speech: Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative Lu Wenqiao said in his speech: "The meaning of our commemoration of Mr. Chen Qimei today has been reported in detail by the chairman. The Chinese Kuomintang is in an environment of rebellion in collusion with feudal warlords, the Reorganization faction, the Western Hills faction, and all counter-revolutionary elements. Therefore, we should unite to continue Mr. Chen Qimei's spirit of fearlessness in order to eliminate all remaining warlords and reactionary forces, and then, in accordance with Mr. Chen Qimei's spirit of non-compromise, cultivate and strive for the independence and freedom of the entire Chinese nation."</p>
<p>Publicity Publications: Many propaganda items were distributed at the meeting, such as the Municipal Propaganda Department's "Era Bi-monthly", the "May Revolution Festival Memorial Booklet", the "In Memory of Our Dead, Mr. Chen Qimei" flyer, pamphlets, slogans, and more.</p>
<p>Meeting Slogans: 1. Mr. Chen Qimei's spirit is immortal! 2. Continue Mr. Chen Qimei's revolutionary spirit! 3. Eliminate the Yan Feng feudal warlords! 4. Clean up all reactionary elements! 5. Down with imperialism! 6. Complete the National Revolution! 7. Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! 8. Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<p>Navy Special Party Department: The Navy Special Party Department in Gaochang Temple held a memorial meeting at 10:00 a.m., presided over by Zheng Youyi. The ceremony was performed according to etiquette. The chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, and Cai Linbing reported on Mr. Chen Qimei's life and great achievements. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Two Railway Party Departments: The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Departments held the 14th anniversary of Mr. Chen Qimei's martyrdom in the auditorium of the department at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 50 people attended, including staff members and representatives from the Labor Union. The chairman was Wang Buqin, the recorder was Bi Zhenghua, and the master of ceremonies was Zhou Lianze. After performing the ceremony according to etiquette, the chairman reported in detail on the circumstances of Mr. Chen Qimei's martyrdom and his life's efforts in the revolution. He hoped that the comrades who died later would inherit Mr. Chen Qimei's revolutionary spirit and work together to see the success of the revolution as soon as possible. Finally, they shouted slogans and adjourned the meeting.</p>
<p>Junyi Middle School: Junyi Middle School on Guohuo Road held a memorial ceremony for Mr. Chen Qimei at 8:00 a.m. yesterday in the school's auditorium. Mr. Xu Xingchu, director of the Guidance Section of the Municipal Propaganda Department, was invited to give a speech on "Mr. Chen Qimei's History in Our Party." His extensive speech vividly described Mr. Chen Qimei's past spirit of struggle for the Party and the country, moving the listeners.</p>
<h3>Memorial Tower for Chen Qimei</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Groundbreaking Ceremony</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang Reports on the Significance of Building the Memorial Tower</p>
<p>Huang Fu Delivers a Speech on Mr. Chen's Life, Achievements, and Character</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 18th) was the 14th anniversary of the martyrdom of revolutionary martyr Mr. Chen Qimei (Yingshi). At 10:00 AM, the Municipal Government held a groundbreaking ceremony for the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower at the triangular area at the intersection of Ximen Zhonghua Road and Fangxie Road. Mayor Zhang Qun, accompanied by Mr. Huang Fu, the section chief of the Municipal Government Secretariat, and bureau chiefs and staff from various bureaus, arrived at the scene. Guests present included Yang Hu, Ye Huijun, Chu Fucheng, Yang Yongtai, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Yiting, Qian Xinzhi, Chen Guofu, Xu Weixia, Chen Xunyong, Fan Zhengbo, Wu Kaixian, and others, as well as representatives from various organizations, groups, and district party headquarters, totaling over 200 people. The Public Security Bureau dispatched a police band and a police detachment to maintain order. The layout of the venue included a decorated stage erected in the center of the triangular area. A white cloth was hung along the eaves of the stage, with the words "Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower" written horizontally. The stage was surrounded by bamboo fences, and a lounge for guests was set up in front of the stage, with flowers, tea, and refreshments displayed on the tables. At 10:25 AM, the meeting commenced with music, and the guests took their seats. Mayor Zhang Qun presided over the meeting, and after performing the ceremonial rituals, Mayor Zhang delivered a speech on the significance of the meeting, as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang's Speech: Today's groundbreaking ceremony for the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower is something that citizens should especially commemorate. I also believe that the foundation of this commemoration has already been built firmly in the hearts of our comrades and compatriots. It is said that people share the same heart, and hearts share the same reason. May Mr. Chen's spirit live forever. Today, many of the guests are old acquaintances of Mr. Chen, or have shared life-and-death struggles with him. Naturally, their understanding of Mr. Chen is very clear, so I need not say more. Moreover, soon after, he resigned with Chairman Chiang, failing to commence this undertaking, which he regretted. After I took office as mayor, I brought up the old topic again, leading to the motivation to build this tower. Although the tower is not large, in addition to commemorating Mr. Chen, it can also be used as an aid to municipal construction. The design of the tower was entrusted to Mr. Shen Yi, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works. It is expected to be completed before this year's Shanghai Restoration Memorial Day. The tower has a spiral staircase that can ascend to the top, offering a panoramic view of the city. It can also serve as a fire lookout tower. It can be considered a very tall tower in this city. As for the reason for choosing this location to build the tower, it is because Mr. Chen, during his tenure as the Shanghai Military Governor, demolished the city walls to build roads and promoted municipal construction, which was the motivation for building a great Shanghai today. This location was once the city moat, worth only 500 yuan per mu at the time. Now, it has risen to tens of thousands of yuan. Taking this one thing as an example, one can imagine how Mr. Chen strived for construction during the period of destruction. Therefore, the Municipal Government designated this location to build the Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower, with a profound intention. It is a pity that Mr. Chen's martyrdom has been 14 years. We cannot see him again. In our grief, we can only hope that our colleagues will continue Mr. Chen's legacy, strive hard to complete the revolution, and be enthusiastic about construction, to fulfill Mr. Chen's purpose of serving the country and the people. This is the meaning of commemorating Mr. Chen, and also the slight intention of building this tower. I wish to encourage myself and my colleagues.</p>
<p>Huang Fu's Speech: Today, in the fifth year of the Republic, is the day Mr. Chen Yingshi was killed. This year, initiated by Mayor Zhang, it is planned to build a memorial tower for Mr. Chen Yingshi in Shanghai, where he was killed. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and I, with all kinds of relationships with Mr. Chen Yingshi in both public and private capacities, of course, are enthusiastically in favor. Therefore, it was decided to commence construction on this year's anniversary of his death. I was also designated to hold the groundbreaking ceremony and expect to complete the project before November 6th of this year, so that the opening ceremony can be held on the Shanghai Restoration Day the next day. This commemorative method cannot but be said to contain infinite significance, infinite value, and infinite emotion. Recalling the time when the Republic was founded, Mr. Chen Yingshi, when he opened his office in Shanghai, every move he made was related to the safety of the overall situation. We do not need to list them in detail, but just mentioning three or four of the most important points can give an overview of the importance of Shanghai at that time. (1) In terms of diplomacy, at the beginning of the Wuchang Uprising, most foreigners believed that the Manchus had occupied the Central Plains for three hundred years, with a deeply rooted foundation, and that it was by no means easy for a small number of revolutionaries to shake them. Therefore, they mostly took a cold, detached attitude towards the booming revolutionary forces. Mr. Chen Yingshi recognized Shanghai as the main place to shift the foreigners' attention. Therefore, all facilities and responses were rationalized, neither arrogant when reason prevailed, nor humble when power prevailed. Over time, foreigners gradually began to recognize the true spirit of the revolutionary group, knowing that there was something in it that could not be ignored. By the time the Provisional Government of Nanjing was established and the Qing Emperor abdicated, the ministers of various countries in the Legation Quarter of Beijing had retreated to a place where nothing could be done. The so-called diplomatic center naturally shifted to Shanghai among the consuls general of various countries. Therefore, the Shanghai Military Governor's Office had an overwhelming burden of diplomatic negotiations, almost single-handedly shouldering the responsibility of the entire country. (2) In terms of transportation, in the midst of military affairs, the most important thing was the smooth transmission of battle reports, the convenience of transportation, the reliable connection between independent provinces, and the safe and rapid external propaganda. Therefore, the control of telecommunications agencies and shipping companies was essential. The Directorate General of Telegraphs and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were both located in Shanghai. Although the Qing Dynasty had the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs, which is now the Ministry of Communications, the national telecommunications and shipping administrations were managed by officials and merchants in the Qing Dynasty. Therefore, all personnel and administration were not unified under the ministry, but unified under the Directorate General of Telegraphs and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Mr. Chen Yingshi had already made preparations for the firm control of these agencies. Therefore, after the start of the war, there was no isolation in the news from all sides, and the transport of troops and the supply of armaments were not delayed at all. (3) In terms of finance, Shanghai, as the largest port in the East, was the economic center of the country. When the Shanghai Army, Zhejiang Army, Jiangsu Army, Anhui Army, Guangdong Army, and Guangxi Army attacked Nanjing, most of the food, ammunition, clothing, etc. of each army were purchased from Shanghai. After Nanjing fell and the provisional government was established, the country was not yet unified, the Northern Expedition had not been completed, and the tax revenue of the provinces south of the Yangtze River suddenly decreased. Therefore, when the central finance was in urgent need, it relied on Shanghai's turnover and adjustment. However, Mr. Chen Yingshi did not increase taxes internally, nor did he borrow money externally. On the one hand, he urged the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau to work day and night shifts to ensure that a portion of the ammunition did not have to be sought externally. On the other hand, he founded banks to promote the active circulation of finance. At the same time, he raised donations for the Northern Expedition in Shanghai and sent many comrades to the Nanyang Islands to raise donations. The enthusiasm of the overseas Chinese to contribute was also quite considerable. (4) In terms of internal affairs, Shanghai was the focus of attention at home and abroad. If there was any unrest in the area, internal grievances would boil over, and external credit would fall to the ground, which would have a great impact on the future of the revolution. Mr. Chen Yingshi was aware of this, so he rectified military discipline with extreme seriousness, never allowing the army to disturb the people. On the one hand, he strived for the well-being of the people in terms of civil affairs facilities. Unless they were truly reactionary elements, he would never try to frame them. Unless they were extremely corrupt and had accumulated bad habits, he would never make unnecessary changes. Therefore, the social situation in Shanghai at that time, even during the critical period of the revolution, did not show any signs of tension or danger. Everyone lived in peace and enjoyed their work. Not only was there no news of murder and robbery, but the word "kidnapping," which is commonly seen in newspapers today, was almost unknown to the people of Shanghai at that time. The above is just four points, and this historical passage is only about twenty years ago. The people of Shanghai still have fresh memories of it. There is no need for me to repeat it. The reason why I must narrate it is that there is a summary point, which I want to take this opportunity to reveal to you. What is the summary point? That is, Mr. Chen Yingshi's recruitment of talents from all sides had a special magic power. No matter who it was, once they met him, they were all convinced by his sincere attitude and sharp words. Therefore, at that time, the old seniors with white hair and beards were all happy to risk their lives, using their reputation and experience to serve Mr. Chen Yingshi. In diplomacy, there were Mr. Wu Zhiyong and Wen Qinfu in charge. In transportation, there were Mr. Wang Yiting, Tang Luwei, and Wu Chengzhai in charge. In finance, there were Mr. Zhu Baosan, Shen Manyun, and Yu Qiaqing in charge. In civil affairs, there was also Mr. Li Pingshu in charge. Therefore, everything could be done and the great cause of creating the Republic could be completed. It was by no means something that one person could do alone. What was even more strange was that Mr. Chen Yingshi could melt all the old seniors and countless younger generations into one furnace, working together in harmony, each doing their best, so that they could all move forward toward the same goal, and never heard of any mutual exclusion, infighting, or shifting of blame. This kind of magic power and ability, although I have been in politics for more than twenty years, I have repeatedly tried to learn from it, but I have not been able to. Looking back on the past, I am truly filled with thousands of emotions and cannot control myself. However, the above four points are only based on his achievements. Mr. Chen Yingshi's personality is also of great value to remember. Achievements are what is expressed externally. Even if no one repeats them, the facts are there, and they have long been seen and heard by the people of the world. Only the personality, those who have followed him for a long time may not know it in detail. When the Republic was founded, I followed Mr. Chen Yingshi day and night, and my feelings were more profound. Therefore, I would like to mention a few more points to remember him. (1) A spirit of benevolence. Those who did not know Mr. Chen Yingshi before his death must have thought that he was a very fierce and terrible person with three heads and six arms, who advocated revolution and personally attacked Shanghai.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>It is not known that Mr. Chen Yingshi was gentle, refined, and full of benevolence. There is a fact to prove this. When Mr. Chen Yingshi led his comrades to attack the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau, seeing that the two sides were in a stalemate and there were many casualties, he suddenly had an idea in the evening, saying that they were all citizens, how could there be no reason to want political reform and national prosperity? It was just that they were confused by the Qing Dynasty's titles and salaries, and did not understand the meaning of the revolution. I will go in alone and explain the great righteousness to them, so that Shanghai can be settled without war, so as to avoid alarming the people and hurting our compatriots. Comrades were worried about the danger and tried to stop him. He said, "If there is an accident today, I will only lose one life. If this stalemate continues, wouldn't it sacrifice many lives?" So he strode straight in and was arrested. The next morning, the comrades attacked even more urgently, the Manufacturing Bureau fell, and the defenders had already taken the opportunity to escape. Mr. Chen Yingshi was untied, smiled, and came out. He met them at the iron gate and only said one sentence, "Are you all here? I don't know how many were killed or injured in the battle this morning." His words seemed very unbearable. It can be said that the deep-seated benevolent spirit within him was revealed unconsciously even in times of distress and haste. (2) The concept of equality. When the North and South were negotiating peace, the old meeting hall of the Public Works Bureau on Nanjing Road was borrowed as the meeting place. One day, Mr. Tang Shaochuan and Wu Zhiyong were in a meeting. Because there was one thing that could not be decided, they telegraphed Mr. Chen Yingshi to attend. Mr. Chen Yingshi asked me to go with him. So we left the office together by car. As we walked past the stairs of the Secretary's Office, there was a chamber pot, and a soldier was urinating. Mr. Chen Yingshi had been meeting guests for too long and wanted to urinate as well. One of the guards understood his intention and warned the soldier, "The Governor wants to urinate, you go away quickly." Mr. Chen Yingshi immediately turned his head and scolded him loudly, "In terms of duty, there is a distinction between the Governor and the soldier. How can there be a reason that the Governor should urinate first and the soldier should urinate later? This is a natural excretion of human physiology and cannot be stopped halfway. If you force it to stop, you will get sick. You should remember that the Governor is also an ordinary citizen, so except for performing his duties, he has no special privileges to enjoy." All this is just an example to prove that Mr. Chen Yingshi was always approachable in his dealings with people. I have never seen him act arrogantly. In recent years, I have been living in seclusion in the mountains, studying Buddhism a little, and I deeply feel that compassion and equality are the two great essences of Buddhist doctrine. Therefore, observing with the eyes of Buddhism, Mr. Chen Yingshi's innate roots actually contain Buddha-nature. (3) Courageous action. I remember Mr. Chen Yingshi once said in a casual conversation that there are points that we must fight for and points that we must give in to. When we must fight, we must not be timid. When we must give in, we must not be brave. I still adhere to this and do not lose it. Therefore, whenever he saw where the great righteousness lay, he would bravely go forward to it. The previous example of entering the Manufacturing Bureau alone to explain the great righteousness to those who resisted is a clear proof of this. His later death was also due to being too brave. Confucius said that those who are benevolent must be brave. Therefore, his courageous action was a by-product of his benevolent spirit. Yangming said that we only accept the drive of conscience, and we do not care about success or failure. Mr. Chen Yingshi had it. (4) Thrift. Mr. Chen Yingshi once spent tens of thousands of gold for the revolution, but his frugality was beyond the reach of ordinary people. When he was the Governor of Shanghai, he initially rented an old-fashioned house on Maho Road. The light was not sufficient, and most of the floors were rotten. Later, when there were many guests, the rooms were sometimes crowded, and there was almost no room to stand. Moreover, it was not elegant to meet foreign guests. He had no choice but to rent a new-style building on Carter Road, but it was only two floors and two bottoms. As for clothing and food, they were even simpler. It can be said that the words "clothing and food" were never imprinted in his mind. Furthermore, in the Governor's Office, all the offices of the three departments and fourteen sections were old-fashioned equipment. Even in the Governor's reception room, there was only a rectangular wooden table surrounded by a dozen small square stools. Those who came to the Shanghai Military Governor's Office for public or private matters in those years all saw it with their own eyes. It is by no means something that I alone can say privately. Thrift can lead to honesty. Therefore, although the salaries of the staff at that time were very low, everyone was happy with it. Honesty became a natural trend without needing to be advocated. Mr. Chen Yingshi first set an example, so his funeral was simple. To this day, Mrs. Chen Yingshi is still raising her sons in a very poor life. Today, we are building this memorial tower for Mr. Chen Yingshi. On the one hand, we remember his achievements. On the other hand, we admire his personality. I have heard that the Municipal Government's survey of the city's population has exceeded three million. In the future, after the tower is completed, the people of Shanghai will observe it every day. As a result, three million benevolent, equal, brave, and thrifty citizens will be created to support the country. Then, we will promote it to the whole country. Not only can political disputes be resolved immediately, but economic disputes can also be avoided. If the trend of thrift becomes established, the enjoyment of life will not differ much between the poor and the rich. If the habit of equality becomes established, there will be no distinction between high positions and ordinary people in social interaction. In addition, if the citizens have a spirit of mutual love and compassion, and have courageous actions of mutual encouragement and mutual struggle, is there any golden world in our country that will not be established immediately? Finally, there is one thing that I must mention. That is, the Republic Road where this tower is built was a very narrow moat along the Shanghai city wall nineteen years ago. There were three or five thatched houses along the edge, interspersed with extremely dirty river water. Because the Governor's Office was located at the old site of the Coastal Defense Hall in the small east gate, I had to pass through it every day to go to the office. The transportation was inconvenient, and the place was contemptible. The people of Shanghai all felt this. Therefore, a group of enlightened people advocated demolishing the city walls. However, times were different. Today, people are used to seeing the demolition of the city walls and are not surprised. However, at the beginning of the Republic, the demolition of the Shanghai city walls was the first of its kind in the country. Therefore, at the same time, there was also a group of conservatives who opposed the demolition of the city walls. Mr. Chen Yingshi silently thought that it was doubtful whether our country's politics could be reformed once and reach the best state, and whether the internal order would no longer need this dilapidated wall to protect it. However, the situation in Shanghai was different. The other side of the moat was a very prosperous concession. Not only was there a distinction between civilization and barbarism, but it was clearly marked. It was our shame. In case others used the excuse of inconvenient transportation and dirty places to rise up and seek to replace us, we would lose our national sovereignty. It is better to do it ourselves first. One can promote the development of the area and eliminate the traces of civilization and barbarism. Two, there is a nearby concession outside the city, and there is a prosperous market inside the city. Even if there is an emergency in the area, we can no longer defend the city walls to defend. Therefore, the city walls have become useless to Shanghai. He then resolutely ordered the demolition of the city walls, which formed the prelude to today's plan for a great Shanghai. At that time, the price of the deformed and dirty land along the foot of the city wall was less than a thousand per mu. The clever ones suspected that the order to demolish the city wall had other purposes. In fact, Mr. Chen Yingshi, with a pure spirit, was single-mindedly seeking development for the area. This kind of petty-mindedness was by no means within their dreams. Not only Mr. Chen Yingshi, but the entire Shanghai Army can be said to have not a single person with an inch of land in the area. However, on the other hand, because they did not have an inch of land at the time, today they can use this few square feet of land to build a memorial tower. And this memorial tower can contain infinite significance and infinite value. Otherwise, if we build a tower here today to commemorate Mr. Chen Yingshi, what would the people of Shanghai think? Today, I am deeply ashamed that you have taken the time to attend the groundbreaking ceremony, and I have spoken too much, wasting your precious time. However, moved by the deepest feelings, I want to stop but cannot stop myself. I ask you to forgive me. Now, with the most sincere attitude, I represent the tower builders to express my gratitude to you. After that, Mr. Ye Huijun delivered a speech on Mr. Chen Yingshi's life and aspirations. After the speech, the chairman announced the groundbreaking ceremony. The guests stood around the foundation of the tower. Huang Fu held a hoe and shoveled the soil, and music was played. The ceremony was completed, and the meeting was adjourned. The time was 11:35 AM.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhang's</h3>
<p>Speech at the Cornerstone Laying Ceremony of the Yingshi Hall</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the cornerstone laying ceremony of the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall was held, and the ceremony was very grand. Mayor Zhang's speech mainly stated that today, the Hushi Committee held a grand cornerstone laying ceremony for the Memorial Hall, and in this honor, I cannot help but feel grief. In this grief, there are also infinite feelings. Mr. Chen Yingshi's great achievements are clearly visible to everyone. In the history of the revolution, it has its own great value. In the history of the party and the country, it has its glorious color. In the minds of the general public, it also has the true meaning of commemoration. It can be said that it cannot be erased by the passage of time. There is no need to say more about it. Today, I am ordered by the National Government to attend as a representative, and I am also honored by the public of Hushi to hold the cornerstone laying ceremony. I would like to express my grief and feelings. What I want to say today are three points: the relationship between Mr. Chen Yingshi and Shanghai, the significance of Hushi establishing the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall, and the psychological foundation of the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall. Finally, I will send the brave bench that bound Mr. Chen Yingshi on the 13th of September in the Xinhai year, which is preserved in the arsenal, to the hall for safekeeping as a permanent memorial. This brave bench can still be recognized after fourteen years today, because there is a technician in the factory, Mr. Shi Weishan, who happened to be serving in the bureau at the time and witnessed Mr. Chen being detained in the brave room, so he can be responsible for proving it. It is a pity that the rope that bound Mr. Chen has long been lost and cannot be stored together, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>Zhang Weihan Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Weihan, the Yunnan Provincial Committee member and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, left Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 AM on the Chichibu Maru. Accompanying him were Mr. Gong Zizhi, Director of the Yunnan Provincial Department of Education, and Secretary Chen Gongxian. Liu Yunfang, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, was dispatched by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang Zhengting, to go to the Whangpoo Dock to see them off. Others who went to see them off included Deng Zhenquan, Commander of the Wusong Fortress, Chen Shiguang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and many members of the Yunnan Fellow Villagers Association.</p>
<h3>Military Circles Received War News Yesterday</h3>
<p>The garrison headquarters received a battle telegram yesterday, stating that according to the report of Army Commander Fan, the rebellious enemy in the Sanlihe area east of Heze surrounded Heze with one division and attacked eastward with two divisions. After our fierce attack on Tuesday, they were completely defeated by dawn today and fled westward towards Heze. Our army is currently tracking and pursuing them. According to the prisoners, the rebel Shi is indeed located seven or eight miles northwest of Heze. Respectfully, your brother Chen Diaoyuan kowtows.</p>
<h3>Record of Prominent Figures' Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Zhu Peide, Chief of Staff of the National Government, and Chen Shaokuan, Acting Minister of the Navy, left Nanjing the night before last and arrived in Shanghai by night train. After getting off the train, Chen went straight to Yang Shuzhuang's mansion to discuss everything, and returned to Nanjing by night train that night.</p>
<p>Wang Jiazhen, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, returned to Nanjing by the Shanghai-Nanjing night train last night.</p>
<p>Yan Deqing, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, was recently transferred by the Ministry of Railways to an important position in the ministry. The vacancy was filled by Sa Fujun, Director of the Engineering Department of the ministry. It is learned that after receiving the ministry's order, Yan took a ship from Qingdao to Shanghai, arriving yesterday, and took the Shanghai-Nanjing night train last night to Nanjing to report everything to Minister Sun.</p>
<h3>Itinerant Vendors Going to France Refused to Land</h3>
<p>Investigate Whether There are Authentic Shop Guarantees</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly issued orders to the commissioners of various provinces to strictly crack down on the passports of peddlers and merchants going abroad to Europe and the United States to do business, so as to avoid these ignorant countrymen being deceived and going abroad, wandering in foreign lands, losing the national image, and losing humanity. Since the abolition of the Diplomatic Commissioner's Office, all passport issuance has been transferred to the Public Security Bureau of the Municipal Government for continued processing. However, the various passports are more stringent than before. All peddler passports can be said to be extremely rare. The French Consulate General has also made new rules, requiring each person to pay 500 yuan in cash as a guarantee before they are allowed to sign. As a result, all the peddlers' attempts to apply for passports have been rejected. Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Chinese Embassy in France stating that in recent years, about one hundred and several dozen peddlers and merchants have come to France by boat from Shanghai. Most of them hold passports, but they are prohibited from entering the country by the French authorities. These peddlers are now in a dilemma. Whether the passports held by these peddlers were issued by Shanghai and whether there are authentic guarantees should be investigated and telegraphed back for verification. It is said that after receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has forwarded it to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, instructing the Public Security Bureau to investigate and reply.</p>
<h3>Wish for Merchants and Factories</h3>
<p>Utilizing the Industrial Products Testing Laboratory</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factories Association sent a letter to various factories, which reads: "To whom it may concern: We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Social Bureau Industrial Products Testing Laboratory, stating that the lack of prosperity in our country's industry and commerce, although its causes are complex, is also due to the fact that our people have not fully understood the usefulness of science, adhering to outdated methods, and producing inferior products, making it difficult to compete with foreign goods. Regarding the promotion of industrial and commercial scientification in European and American countries, we will not discuss it for now. Even in neighboring Japan, in the past twenty years, the rapid advancement of industry and commerce, achieving strength and prosperity, has all been due to emulating the efforts of Europe and America. Currently, that country has established no fewer than dozens of industrial research institutes and testing organizations, resolving doubts, analyzing difficulties, imitating and improving. One aspect is due to the government's encouragement, but without the knowledge and utilization of manufacturers, it would be difficult to achieve today's good results. Looking back at our country, although we possess abundant natural resources, due to a lack of excellent technology and economic pressure, established factories are closing down daily, and new ventures are as rare as stars. It is truly heartbreaking to speak of this. The Shanghai Municipal Government, in view of this, established an industrial testing laboratory in the Seventeenth Year as part of its policy guidelines, aiming to assist in the improvement of industry and commerce in the city. The laboratory is extremely willing to assist any manufacturer in the city who entrusts technical problems for research or testing. Initially, it was intended to be free of charge, but to avoid unconscious entrustment, a very small handling fee will be charged to indicate a limitation. As for factories entrusting research to improve products or raw material problems, no fees will be charged in advance. As for the raw materials and items needed during the research, they can be provided by the entrustor, or bought and sold by our laboratory, all of which are acceptable, but a contract must be signed in advance. After the research is successful and effective, the entrustor will provide a one-time or annual subsidy to supplement the laboratory's expenses, so that the scope of our laboratory can be gradually expanded and its effectiveness can be universal. This is not only for the benefit of both parties. Furthermore, our laboratory wants to understand the situation of various industries and will regularly invite three or four manufacturers to the laboratory each week for face-to-face discussions to learn about the technical difficulties in each industry in order to provide guidance or research for improvement. However, some manufacturers still do not understand the intentions of our laboratory and ignore them, not sending representatives or replying, which is deeply regrettable. We have always admired your association as the hub of the business community, making plans for the future of national products, and relying on all means. We dare to trouble your association to widely publicize our laboratory's aim to seek improvement and development for the city's industry, so that manufacturers can understand and utilize it collectively. We hope that you will convey this separately and look forward to your valuable advice." The 20th century is an era of scientific invention. If factories still adhere to outdated methods in manufacturing goods, it will be difficult to compete with foreign goods. Since the government established this laboratory with the aim of assisting in the improvement of industry and commerce, and stated that no fees will be charged in advance for manufacturers entrusting technical problems for research or testing, and even the raw materials needed during the research will be provided by the entrustor or purchased by the laboratory at its own expense, accommodating merchants and seeking perfection in every possible way, it can be said to be meticulous. We hereby inform you accordingly. We hope that you will investigate. In the future, if the laboratory sends personnel to the factory or invites manufacturers to the laboratory to study technical improvement issues, please dispel your doubts, explain the advantages and disadvantages in detail, so that they can be used for research. This is our greatest hope.</p>

<h3>On the Pacific</h3>
<p>Unprecedented Giant Liner</p>
<p>Chang Hing's Empress of Japan</p>
<p>Crosses the Pacific in Ten Days</p>
<p>In recent years, the competition between Britain, Japan, and the United States in the Pacific shipping industry has been extremely fierce. Nippon Yusen Kaisha first added three new liners, and Chang Hing Company also specially built a new giant liner with a displacement of 37,000 tons, named the Empress of Japan. The ship is 666 feet long and has nine decks, with 400 first-class rooms, 168 second-class rooms, 100 third-class rooms, and 548 steerage rooms, accommodating over 1,000 passengers in total. The elegant arrangement of passenger seats in the ship, as well as the grand hall, smoking room, gym, bathhouse, etc., are all well-equipped, and the facilities are even more elaborate than those on Atlantic liners, which is truly a novel concept in the Pacific. The fastest ship in the Pacific currently has a speed of no more than 21 miles per hour, while the speed of the Empress of Japan is expected to be over 23 nautical miles per hour. If traveling from Shanghai to Vancouver without any delays along the way, it could cross the Pacific and reach the United States within ten days. This ship has now been completed and is currently being fitted with passenger seats. Its first voyage from the United Kingdom to the Suez Canal will be to Shanghai, and its maiden voyage from Shanghai is scheduled to depart on August 10th to Canada. After this ship comes to Shanghai and starts its service, it will be the largest and fastest mail ship in the Pacific, unprecedented in its size and speed. The Japanese and American ships on the same route will all be eclipsed. It is said that the construction cost of this ship and the arrangement of the cabins, etc., cost Chang Hing Company over 30 million yuan in Chinese currency.</p>
<h3>Cao Jinbiao's Accomplices</h3>
<p>Three More Arrested Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Three Robbers, Two Men and One Woman</p>
<p>A Large Batch of Weapons Seized</p>
<p>After the Gordon Road Police Station of the Public Concession arrested thirteen male and female robbers, including the notorious robber Cao Jinbiao, in the Beijing Apartment on Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession, the case was heard by the Special District Court the day before yesterday. It is now reported that detectives Wang Chengying and Pang Ruiqing of the General Police Station, and detectives Hua Yueshan, Shao Jingfan, and Chang Xixun of the Gordon Road Police Station, etc., learned that there were still many accomplices in this case hiding in the Dapuqiao area of the Chinese Concession. Therefore, yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, they reported to the police chief, immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, all equipped with firearms, and drove police cars to Rue Massenet Police Station in the French Concession to request cooperation. Immediately, the detectives from both police stations secretly went to No. 415 Dapuqiao at the end of Rue Cardinal Mercier to arrest the accomplices. Unexpectedly, the building was empty. The detectives then went to No. 13, Lane Liuhe, Rue Lagrene in the jurisdiction, and arrested the robbers Zhang Afu from Jiangbei, the female robber Zhu Wushi, and Song Wangshi. After a search, there were no prohibited items. For the sake of serious public duty, the detectives interrogated the robbers strictly. Later, according to the female robber Song Wangshi, there were still pistols, Mauser pistols, etc., hidden at No. 42, Lane Tianxiang, Rue de Baron Gros. Upon hearing the news, the Chinese and foreign detectives immediately rushed to the location and found no one in sight, and the door was wide open. They immediately searched carefully and thoroughly. As a result, they found two six-inch pistols, one Mauser pistol, and over three hundred bullets in a box in the back building. After the detectives finished the search, they escorted the three robbers and the prohibited items to the Gordon Road Police Station, and they will be sent to the court for trial on a scheduled date. Later, the police learned that the notorious robbers Cao Jinbiao and Zhang Afu were not only related to the case of the killing of Chinese police officer No. 463 Liu Youqing on Changping Road on March 31, but also had major suspicions in the recent kidnapping cases in western Shanghai at night. Therefore, the police are still conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Small Shop Owner of Machine Store</h3>
<p>Completely Reverses Previous Confession in Court</p>
<p>Handwritten Confession Was Not His Intention</p>
<p>Forced by Detectives to Confess</p>
<p>Zhou Wangzuo, whose nickname is A Long, is the small shop owner of Liangpian Machine Store in Wanyu Wharf, Nanshi. This year, he was detained by a detective from the First District Police Station for the case of intimidating Song Zuoxian, a rent collector for the Catholic Church. Unexpectedly, Zhou Wangzuo confessed in the Public Security Bureau Detective Team</p>
<h3>In Addition to Admitting the Intimidation and Fraud Case in His Handwritten Confession</h3>
<p>He also confessed that he had colluded with others to rob the Tianfu Tea Food Store in Wanyu Wharf and the Yao Zhigao family in Yongzhen Lane, and that he had received ten yuan or five yuan each time. Based on his handwritten confession, the Public Security Bureau transferred the case to the District Court, and the prosecutor cited the crimes of repeated robbery and intimidation to</p>
<p>File a public prosecution. Wu Magistrate opened the court for trial the day before yesterday. Zhou Wangzuo testified that he was 26 years old and from Shangyu. Asked if he knew Tang Guiren and Luo Shunchang, he replied that he did not know them. Asked if he had confessed in the Public Security Bureau that he and Tang Guiren had taken pistols to rob the Yao family in Yongzhen Lane while at the Yunzhou Hotel in the Public Concession, he replied that after he was arrested, the detective had taken him to the Yao family, and the Yao family said that he was not among them. Asked if he had also confessed that he and Tang had robbed the Tianfu Candy Store in Wangjia Wharf of over one hundred yuan in November, he replied that he had not done so. Asked if he had also confessed that he had robbed the Gong family in Yongzhen Lane of jewelry in November, he replied that their house was next to his, and the detective had falsely accused him. Asked if he had confessed that he and Mao Guozhong had intimidated the Song family for two thousand yuan last May, he replied that it was also a false accusation. Asked why he had confessed and then transcribed a copy in his own handwriting, he replied that after he was arrested,</p>
<p>He was tortured and forced to say what they told him to say. As for transcribing the confession in his own handwriting, it was because they forced him to write a copy of the confession as the person who wrote the threatening letter to verify his handwriting. He did not expect to be deceived and used as evidence. Asked if he had any injuries from the torture he described, he replied that there were scars from the bindings on his hands and feet, and he had asked the prosecutor to examine them after he was sent to the prosecutor's office. Asked if he had any feud with the detective who had harmed him, he replied that he did not know. Asked how his shop was doing, he replied that it could make ten thousand silver dollars a year, and that he had received a secondary education, etc. The plaintiff,</p>
<p>Song Zuoxian, testified that he was 33 years old, formerly living at No. 1 Yongzhen Lane, and now living at No. 10 Yong'an Lane. He worked as a rent collector for the Catholic Church. Asked if he had received a threatening letter at his home in May, he replied that he had received a total of four letters, demanding two thousand yuan. Asked if he had contacted them, he replied that he had entrusted a detective to contact them, and he had not been on the scene himself, and the money had not been sent. Asked if he knew Zhou Wangzuo, he replied that he did.</p>
<p>He was a neighbor across the street. Asked what kind of person he was, he replied that he ran a machine store in Wanyu Wharf. Asked where he lived, he replied that he rented a house. Asked if he was well-behaved, he replied that he looked like a businessman running a shop. Asked if Zhou Wangzuo had written the threatening letter, he replied that the handwriting on the letter did not look like his handwriting, etc. Yao Zhigao also testified that he was 43 years old and worked as a donation collector for the Nanshi Fire Brigade, living at No. 157 Yongzhen Lane, South of the Catholic Church. Asked if his home had been robbed, he replied that he had been robbed at 7:00 PM on March 18 of the previous year. Three robbers came with guns. He had just arrived home and entered the door when the robbers were already inside, pointing a Mauser pistol at his chest. He told them that there was a security team in front and a telephone in the back. They robbed him and left early. They said, "You</p>
<p>are a very handsome person," so they took cash, jewelry, etc., and left. Zhou Wangzuo was his neighbor, and he knew him, but they did not talk. He was definitely not among them that day. Asked if he often worked in the shop, he replied that his maternal uncle was in charge of the shop, and he himself was not in the shop. At this point, Prosecutor Li</p>
<p>Stated his opinion, saying that the defendant had confessed three times to robbery and intimidation in the Public Security Bureau. The defendant had committed three counts of gang robbery and intimidation for profit and should be sentenced according to the law. His defense lawyer then argued, and the judge announced the end of the debate, setting the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the 22nd. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Old Uncle</h3>
<p>Forcibly Defiled a Nine-Year-Old Girl</p>
<p>Threatened Her Not to Speak Afterward</p>
<p>Witness Said the Defendant Was Well-Behaved</p>
<p>Paid 600 Yuan Bail for Further Interrogation</p>
<p>Zheng Afu, also known as Jin A Bao, from Baoshan, is in his forties and lives at No. 1346 Gordon Road. Xu Xiangsheng from Songjiang, who lives in the same house, has a daughter named Ju Di, who is nine years old. Zheng actually committed a bestial act on the young girl on November 4 of last year, causing injury to her lower body. Xu then filed a complaint with the Provisional Court, and Zheng was repeatedly interrogated, but he denied it, and the case was not concluded. The afternoon before yesterday, Judge Xu Jiashi of the Special District Court continued to hear the case. According to Xu Xiangsheng's wife, Mrs. Xu, on that afternoon, both she and her husband were out on business, leaving their daughter at home. The defendant was able to take the opportunity to insult their daughter. Later, when they returned, the daughter initially kept it hidden. The next day, seeing the daughter showing pain when urinating, followed by crying, she asked her about it. The daughter still kept it secret, but from then on, the wound worsened daily, eventually leading to her being bedridden. The daughter finally revealed everything, saying that she was forced down on a bench by the old uncle (i.e., the defendant) when no one was around, her pants were taken off, and after the rape, he threatened her not to tell her parents, or he would kill her with a knife. Fearing his power, she initially dared not tell the truth. She then asked the defendant for medical expenses to treat her daughter, originally not wanting to publicize it. Unexpectedly, the defendant not only did not give medical expenses, etc., but also scolded them, so they had to sue, requesting severe punishment of the rapist, etc., and presented the doctor's examination report on the girl's injury. The defendant invited You Shaoxiang to the court as a witness. According to You, he works as a clerk in the engineering department of the Gordon Road Police Station and has known the defendant for a long time, knowing that his conduct has always been well-behaved. He works as a mason in the engineering department. He finished work and returned home at five o'clock in the afternoon of November 4, and he still came to work as usual on the fifth and sixth, and there was no sign of unease. The plaintiff's lawyer, upon hearing what the witness said, immediately stood up and stated that the foreman of the engineering department was the defendant's younger brother. This witness was under the defendant's younger brother, and his testimony was clearly biased towards one side and should be carefully considered. Moreover, the defendant was arrested by the Luodian Public Security Bureau and was interrogated at that time, so it would not be difficult to investigate his confession, etc. Judge Xu ordered the defendant to pay 600 yuan bail and adjourned the hearing to continue interrogating the necessary witnesses.</p>
<h3>Success of Domestic Photographic Materials</h3>
<p>Invented by Mr. Chen Xiaofang</p>
<p>Will Be Released in Three or Four Days</p>
<p>Since chemist Chen Xiaofang announced the non-glossy printing paper and enlarging paper he made last autumn, domestic photographers and photographic businesses have all been looking forward to it, hoping that it would be released soon to meet their urgent needs. Mr. Chen has spent five or six years of painstaking effort and countless amounts of money creating this photographic paper. After the trial was successful, he became more courageous and put all his efforts into researching the production of glossy and dry plates, etc., which has now been largely successful. Four types, including Aina printing paper, Lili art paper, Fula dry plates, and Pipi enlarging paper, will be launched first. This is truly a great contribution to our country's industrial circles that has never been seen before. These photographic papers are all distributed by Xiaofang Photographic Chemical Industry Factory and each has its own unique advantages. Aina printing paper is divided into full light, semi-light, and multiple types, used to print various figures and landscapes, with rich layers and non-fading colors. The photos printed on Lili art paper have well-balanced shades, suitable for both yin and yang, with moving colors and great artistic meaning. Fula dry plates have tough and uniform coating surfaces, suitable for various photographic shots, with clear differentiation between light and dark. Pipi enlarging paper is soft, delicate, and never changes color. It is expected that after the photographic community purchases and uses it, it will surely be praised as unprecedented, able to compete with foreign goods, and even surpass them. Last year, the Shanghai Special Municipality Second National Products Movement awarded a certificate of new industrial products to the factory as encouragement. Experts in photography and chemical industry called it "excellent quality and comparable to foreign goods." However, since last autumn, another six months have passed, and perfection has been pursued. The beauty of the quality is even better than before. Mr. Chen's spirit of hard work and vigorous progress is commendable. The general distribution office of Xiaofang Photographic Chemical Industry Factory is located at Room A12, 2nd Floor, Central Mansion, Sichuan Road. The factory has been very busy recently, rushing to produce a large number of products to prepare for the photographic community to choose and purchase. After the new goods are launched in three or four days, it will definitely cause foreign merchants to lose face. This is not only a major invention in the photography industry, but also a good phenomenon in our country's industrial circles.</p>
<h3>A Woman from Jiangyin Sues a Woman from Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>To Compete for Her Late Husband's Estate</p>
<p>Who Is the True Wife?</p>
<p>Zhou Zhishi, a young woman from Jiangyin, hired someone to draft a complaint to the District Court, accusing Zhou Gengshi, a woman from Zhenjiang, of seizing her late husband's estate, demanding an analysis of about 800 yuan. Her words are: "The plaintiff is 21 years old this year, residing at No. 532 Xishang Baoxing Road, Zhabei. On the 29th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar last year, I married Zhou Shunfa, a man from Zhenjiang and the owner of Tianfu Tang Pharmacy on Xibaoxing Road, through a matchmaker. There was no difference in our cases, and we have been married until this spring when my husband fell ill. He sent a letter to his hometown, and my husband's mother and his legal wife, Zhou Gengshi, came to Shanghai to visit him. The plaintiff only learned of the deception at this point, but it was too late. Unexpectedly, my husband's illness was incurable, and Gengshi came to Shanghai on the third day, and my husband died of illness. The plaintiff, as usual, dressed in mourning, but before many days had passed, I was driven out by the defendant Zhou Gengshi, who did not recognize me. In this emergency, I filed a lawsuit to request追云云" Yesterday, Magistrate Chen Zuyu opened the court for trial, but the defendant did not arrive. According to the plaintiff Zhou Zhishi's statement of the past, she also stated that her husband died in early February of this year at the age of 31. Asked if she was the wife or the concubine, she replied that she was the wife. At that time, her husband said that he had never married a wife before. At this point, the plaintiff presented two large dragon and phoenix wedding invitations to the court for inspection. After reading them, the judge ordered the plaintiff to retreat and wait for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Only a Husband-Wife Name</h3>
<p>Lu Fengying Seeks Husband's Abandonment</p>
<p>Submits a Petition to Allow Separation</p>
<p>The woman Lu Fengying recently hired lawyer Huang Huizhou to file a lawsuit in the District Court, accusing her husband Yuan Qinglian of abandoning her and requesting a divorce, etc. The petition stated: "The plaintiff is 28 years old this year, from Nantong, and currently resides at No. 1312 Zishou Lane, Xiwangjiazhai, Beichezhan. In the past, at the age of 23, I married the defendant Yuan Qinglian. Since marrying him, the defendant has neglected the household expenses and abused and beat the plaintiff. Recently, the defendant has disappeared and has only a husband-wife name and no husband-wife reality. For this reason, I respectfully request permission to divorce," etc. Magistrate Tong Shengli opened the court for trial yesterday. The plaintiff Lu Fengying testified about the past and stated that the defendant is currently working as a clerk at lawyer Zheng Tianxi's office and has not been home recently. Even if he occasionally comes home, he will beat the plaintiff and destroy things, and point to my abdomen,</p>

<p>Claiming that the pregnancy I carry is not his. Also, the rent is six months in arrears. The official said, "Not paying rent cannot be considered a reason for divorce." She replied, "After the defendant returned home on March 14 this year, he destroyed things without asking why and threw my two hats into the toilet." The official said, "This cannot be considered abuse. Moreover, you have been married to the defendant for six years, and the divorce has not reached the point of no return. It is still better not to divorce." The witness Wang Defeng testified that he was a neighbor of the plaintiff and a friend of the defendant. The official asked if he had tried to persuade them. He replied, "I have tried to persuade them." The official asked, "Why did the defendant fail to appear twice when summoned?" He replied, "I do not know." The official said, "Go and notify the defendant that he must be present at the next hearing, otherwise, there will be only one-sided debate." The witness respectfully obeyed the order and withdrew from the court.</p>

<p>Neighboring Woman Suspected of Causing Death</p>
<p>Handed Over to the Police Station for Punishment</p>
<p>Feng Qiushi from Changzhou, who works as a staff member at the American Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., has a wife and concubine living at No. 3 Hongtai Qing Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. The concubine, surnamed Liu, is 21 years old this year and is extremely beautiful. Feng treats her like a treasure. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, she had a dispute with Zhang, the wife of Huang Jinhai from Wuxi, who runs the Huang Yichang Iron Shop next door. She was ridiculed and insulted by Zhang, and in anger, she secretly bought a small can of opium. It was late at night, and the family was all asleep, unaware. When Feng returned from watching a play, he saw his concubine lying stiff on the bed, her face pale. He touched her and found that she was barely breathing. He was greatly shocked and quickly sent her to the hospital for treatment, but she was too deeply poisoned and died the next morning. Feng was extremely saddened but did not know the cause of her suicide. He then inquired among the people and learned that Huang Zhang was suspected of causing the death of his concubine. He then twisted her and filed a complaint with the Second Precinct of the Fifth District. Since the case involved human life, it was sent to the Judicial Section for verification.</p>
<h3>Wants to Join the Army and Becomes Insane</h3>
<p>Wears Red Cloth as Armed Cloth</p>
<p>Dances Wildly on the Road</p>
<p>Bu Shouyu, a local man, is 18 years old and literate. He lives near Yongxing Stack, Lujiazui, Pudong. He used to work in the printing department of the British American Tobacco Company and his salary was just enough to make a living. Bu found the work to be very hard and there was no hope of promotion. Recently, he wanted to go out to join the army and become an official, but his parents refused. As a result, Bu was depressed all day long and became insane, with erratic moods. Yesterday at 4:00 PM, Bu's old illness suddenly broke out. He tied two strips of red cloth around his shoulder as an armed belt and rushed to the area around the Lujiazui Tobacco Factory, dancing wildly. The viewers blocked the road and burst into laughter. The police on duty were then brought to the Third District of the Public Security Bureau to investigate the situation and ordered his family to take him back and strictly supervise him so that he would not go out and cause trouble.</p>
<h3>Rice Boat Collides with a Navigation Boat</h3>
<p>Two Boatmen Drowned</p>
<p>The rice boat Shen Juju, hired by Kun Jihao the day before yesterday to load three hundred bags of Xiao Jiao foreign rice, was heading to Jiaxing for delivery. Because they were in a hurry to sell, they urged Shen to drive quickly. Yesterday morning, they raised anchor, and in the afternoon, they sailed to Nan Huangpu, eighteen miles to the Pu surface. Because they were turning the rudder, there was a sudden Songjiang sailing boat sailing at high speed. The two boats were unable to avoid each other and collided violently. Shen's boat was smaller and the load was heavier, causing it to capsize. The boatmen also fell into the water. The navigation boat also knocked down a crew member, and the bow was damaged but not seriously, so they lowered the sails and stopped to rescue. Six people were rescued on the spot, and two of Shen's crew members were drowned. Fortunately, Shen's boat was in shallow water and the deck was exposed. The two boats are currently negotiating, each with its own reasons, mutually pursuing the losses suffered. It is said that the foreign rice is covered by water insurance.</p>
<h3>Yangjiadu Pu Surface</h3>
<p>Dragon Boat Races Were Arrested</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 2:00 PM, there was a boat on the Yangjiadu Pu surface in Nanshi, carrying more than ten people who were practicing dragon boat racing. These people were dressed strangely and danced. The shouts were mixed with the sound of gongs and drums. People heard near and far gathered to watch, either on the Pu shore or standing on the bows of various ships, which was quite crowded and extremely dangerous. Wu Minshen and Fu Jixiang, patrol captains of the Water Patrol Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, were patrolling the river and saw this strange phenomenon, which had already been strictly prohibited by order. They were actually openly rowing dragon boats, causing men and women to gather to watch and disturbing public order to the extreme. Therefore, they immediately went forward to arrest them. At that time, the people began to flee in confusion. The rowing boat was detained, along with the large Guan Dao, etc., and brought back to the team to report to Captain Xu for handling.</p>

<p>Luo Wang from Guangdong, 17 years old, went to his maternal uncle's Guanghe Xing rattan shop at No. 140 Baotong Road, Zhabei, yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM to chat for a while. Then he went with his uncle Chen Hetian to Wusong Road to buy shoes. After arriving at their destination, they were about to cross the road. At that time, there were many vehicles and they were coming and going like shuttles. Luo was eager to run across the road and was suddenly hit by public bus No. 5818. The wheels rolled over his abdomen and he was barely breathing. The driver was Russian. Indian police officer No. 119 of the Hongkou Police Station saw this, copied the license plate number, and carried Luo Wang into Tongren Hospital for treatment. Because the injuries were too serious, the medical treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>

At 5:15 PM, the original special train returned to Shanghai, arriving at 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Adds Special Silk Cocoon Trains</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway has been experiencing freight congestion recently. With the arrival of silk cocoons and tea on the market, the existing freight trains were insufficient for transportation. A large quantity of fresh cocoons awaited shipment from the Gongchen and Chang'an stations to Shanghai. Therefore, yesterday, a temporary special train for cocoons was added from Chen and Chang'an, consisting of twenty carriages loaded with 3,000 bales of cocoons, arriving at the South Station at 2:30 AM yesterday morning. It is reported that today, the Gongchen, Chang'an, Linping, and Xucun stations are heavily congested with cocoon bales.

<h3>Petition of Pudong Meat Businesses</h3>
<p>The Difficulty of Distance</p>
<p>Fresh meat shops in Pudong, such as those in Lan Ni Du, Yang Jia Du, and Lao Bai Du, previously received an order from the Municipal Health Bureau, aiming to emphasize hygiene, to cease meat inspection at their locations and to slaughter all their pigs in the Yangjing area. These meat businesses stated that, currently, the weather is hot, and Yangjing is far away. Not only is it difficult to travel back and forth, but the fresh meat is bound to change color and emit odor. Since there are no technicians for inspection locally, how dare they slaughter and sell privately? Recently, they jointly submitted a petition to the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association, requesting them to forward it to higher authorities for consideration and action. It is now heard that the meat industry association has already submitted the situation to the Municipal Commerce and Assembly, requesting them to forward it to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government for sympathetic consideration and action.</p>

<h3>Automobile Kills Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Driver Released on 500 Yuan Bail</p>
<p>Automobile driver Zhu Shugong from Jiangbei was driving a No. 9503 cargo truck westward on Beijing Road at noon the other day, when another car sped towards him from the east. In order to avoid a collision, Zhu swerved to the left, causing his car to hit a cyclist in front of him. The cyclist was knocked down. A guard named Jin Yaozhen from a certain trust company saw this and immediately reported it to the police, noting down the car's license plate. The cyclist, Zhu Laowu, was sent to the hospital, but his injuries were severe, and he died shortly after. The Lao Zha police station ordered detectives to take the body to the Fielun Road morgue for examination. An investigation revealed that the deceased's cousin, Wei Lingen, was in Shanghai. The witnesses were summoned to the morgue the morning before yesterday. At ten o'clock, Guo, a prosecutor from the Special District Court, arrived to examine the body. Seated in his official position, Jin Yaozhen testified about Zhu Shugong's careless driving. Zhu Shugong claimed that he was unable to avoid the collision. Prosecutor Guo ordered that Zhu Laowu's body be handed over to Wei Lingen to be claimed for burial after signing a statement. Zhu Shugong was released on 500 yuan bail and sent to the court for trial.</p>

<p>Shen Genbao, a 14-year-old apprentice from the Zhu Taixing leather goods store outside Lao Ximen, is a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and speaks with a Shanghai accent. He lives near the old garbage bridge in the Public Concession. He went missing the other day after leaving home. His family initially thought he was at the store, while the store thought he had returned home. Only after several days did they realize he was missing.

<p>Yesterday morning at around ten o'clock, the Public Concession's Harbin Road police station received a confidential report stating that there were multiple robbers who had committed numerous crimes in the concession. It was discovered that they were hiding in Room 110 of the Traffic Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. The head of the police station, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Western Detective Gan Peier and Chinese Detective Sun Shaokun to lead a group of detectives, all wearing steel armor and carrying concealed weapons, to first report to the French police station. The French police station then dispatched detectives to join them. At noon, they successfully apprehended one person named Shen Yulong in the said room and another suspect in Room 84. They were immediately taken to the Harbin Road police station. After interrogation by the head of the police station, Shen confessed that he was 29 years old, from Dongtai, and admitted to forming a gang and committing robberies repeatedly. He also revealed that his accomplices were hiding in a certain house near the Xin Kai He in the Chinese area. The original detectives, accompanied by Shen, rushed to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, where the detective team dispatched detectives to apprehend them at the address. However, the others had already fled upon hearing the news. Shen is currently detained at the police station awaiting trial.</p>
<h3>Robbers Injure Victim in Street Robbery</h3>
<p>Xu Yixi, a 31-year-old man from Suzhou, came to Shanghai yesterday to collect 600-700 yuan from Wang Shunxing Company on Qujiang Road, Zhabei. After lunch, he bought some items on Fourth Road. Afterwards, he passed by the Changle Teahouse and went upstairs to rest and have tea. He took out the money from his pocket and carefully counted it on the table several times, unaware that he was being watched by robbers. After paying for the tea, he hurried downstairs to the North Railway Station, intending to take a train back to his hometown. Little did he know that four robbers were following him closely. When Xu arrived at the station, the train had already departed, so he had to return to Wang Shunxing Company on Qujiang Road for accommodation, waiting for the dawn to return to Suzhou. As he was walking on Bazilu Road, at a time when many lights were on and few people were around, four robbers surrounded him, brandished sharp knives, and demanded that he not shout and hand over all the money in his pocket. Xu resisted slightly and was stabbed twice by the robbers, once in the left waist and once on the left ankle. The patrolmen from Post 844 heard the alarm and arrived, but the robbers had already fled with the loot. The injured person was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng</h3>
<p>Quells Tram Workers' Strike in French Concession</p>
<p>During the recent tram strike in the Public Concession, tram workers in the French Concession also planned to provide assistance. Upon hearing this, Chinese Director Du Yuesheng urgently discussed the matter with the leaders of the tram workers' union, stating that strikes should only be used as a last resort and that the turmoil should not be expanded. If there were any requests, he would do his best to find a solution within his capabilities. The union side was very understanding, and the turmoil was quelled invisibly.</p>
<h3>Liquidation of Yuda Zhuang</h3>
<p>Total Debts Amount to 961,800 Taels</p>
<p>First Installment of 50% to Be Paid on the 25th of This Month</p>
<p>Yuda Exchange House on Tianjin Road, due to embezzlement by shareholders, ceased operations on March 3 of this year and declared liquidation. The Money Industry Association Committee formed a separate Liquidation Committee to take over the liquidation procedures of the house and handled it according to Article 22 of the Money Industry Association's Business Rules. The firm of Yuan Han Yun and Wang Fu Chang, lawyers from the Tongren Fayi Office, and accountant Xu Yongzuo, were engaged to manage the accounts. Now, after more than two months, there is progress in the liquidation matters, and funds have been received for distribution according to percentages. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a meeting was held in the council hall of the association, inviting the creditors. One hundred and nineteen creditors attended, with a total debt of 961,800 taels. The meeting was held to discuss the matter, and Chairman Pei Yunqing gave a detailed report on the progress, as follows: (1) Yuda Zhuang declared liquidation on March 3. This committee, in accordance with the provisions of Article 22 of the association's rules (rules attached), accepted the house's important documents, sealed them jointly, and disposed of them. A notice was published requesting creditors to register within fourteen days. A review of the total income and expenditure shows that assets amount to 1,762,000 taels, including 825,000 taels owed by the Zhou family and 77,400 taels in pledged funds, totaling 900,000 and 2,000 taels. The remaining approximately 860,000 taels are debts from various customers. Liabilities include capital of 120,000 taels, surplus of 65,000 taels, and debts of 1,577,000 taels, including pledged funds of 350,000 taels from Siming Bank and 50,000 taels from Zhonghui Bank. Shareholders Zhou Zishan and Wu Chenghe each advanced 70,000 taels, and Zhao Yuting advanced 175,000 taels, totaling 315,000 taels. Shareholders Zhou Weibin (three shares, should pay 210,000 taels), Zhou Fuqing (one and a half shares, should pay 105,000 taels), and Zhang Shuping (one share, should pay 70,000 taels) have not advanced funds, so it has not been possible to fully repay creditors according to the amount owed. (2) Funds already received are deposited at Yi Da Zhuang. As of yesterday (18th), there is a total of 451,700 taels. It is decided to pay back 50% of the total debt owed, totaling 480,900 taels, on the 25th of this month. The shortfall will be made up by the Liquidation Office through all possible means. (3) A small number of creditors have not yet registered. Therefore, a notice is published requesting them to register promptly. After three days of review, funds will be paid on the fourth day. (4) Currently, the liquidation and repayment treat "promissory notes," "deposits," "long-term," and "current accounts" equally, all paying 50%. The remaining unpaid amount will be distributed proportionally after debts are recovered or unpaid shareholders advance funds. The full text of Article 22 of the Money Industry Rules is appended below. If a member firm closes down, the handling will be as follows: (A) The firm's tickets and checks that have not been cashed by 12:00 midnight on the day of closure will be returned to the original issuing firm. (B) The account box and important items will be jointly sealed by the association and the manager. (C) The accountant will be jointly engaged by the association and the shareholder or manager, and an impartial lawyer will be appointed. (D) All deposits and debts will be collected and paid by the accountant. No matter what kind of account, it shall not be privately offset or transferred internally. (E) The accountant shall ascertain the amount of deficit of the firm, and the shareholder shall first advance funds according to the shares. (F) If any shareholder has deposits or debts, the deposits shall be handled in the same way as those of the creditors, and the debts shall be repaid as soon as possible. (G) The accountant shall collect all the funds and deposit them with the association. All Chinese and foreign official and commercial funds and ticket funds shall be advertised and distributed proportionally.</p>
<h3>Grain Association</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Grain Association yesterday issued a notice to fellow traders, stating that the Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau had instructed that all transactions of foreign rice by members of the association must be registered daily according to the attached form and submitted to the investigator for filing with the bureau.

All members are required to fill out the Foreign Rice Registration Form for all transactions of foreign rice from May 18 onwards, in order to comply with the law. This is of utmost importance and is hereby announced.</p>
<h3>Pharmaceutical Industry Dismisses Unemployed Workers</h3>
<p>Dismissal Fee of 2,000 Yuan Transferred to Social Affairs Bureau</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Association, regarding the dismissal of unemployed workers yesterday, submitted a dismissal fee of 2,000 yuan, requesting the Commerce Association to transfer it to the Social Affairs Bureau. The original petition stated: "Regarding the implementation of the central government's resolution, we enclose the dismissal fee for unemployed workers and acknowledge the payment of half of the wages during the strike period. As for the forced placement and replacement worker system, we still respectfully request that it be abolished. Regarding the case of the association forcing colleagues to place unemployed workers, leading to a strike turmoil, we have repeatedly stated the reasons why placement is not possible and have submitted separate petitions to various higher-level agencies, requesting a fair resolution. Subsequently, we received six resolutions from the Central Executive Committee through your association. Our association deeply admires the central government's efforts to mediate labor-management relations and will certainly comply with the order in order to resolve the matter as soon as possible. However, this case is of great importance to the future of the industry, and there are still things that must be said to your association: (1) The pharmaceutical industry is related to people's lives. The association does not know this, but this time, the pharmaceutical workers' union, with a small number of workers, forced employed workers to strike before requesting mediation according to law, causing a strike turmoil. It has been going on for several months and has not been resolved. The association has been hoping to resume business during these months, but it has been powerless and has watched the public suffer, groaning on their beds. There are prescriptions but no medicine to save them. Thinking of this, our hearts are truly pained. However, tracing the responsibility, the pharmaceutical workers' union cannot shirk its blame. This is the first thing that must be stated. (2) Regarding the third resolution of the central government, to pay half of the wages during the strike period, the pharmaceutical industry's strike this time, according to Article 23 of the Association Law, is actually illegal. Wages should not only not be paid, but should be subject to appropriate sanctions. However, the central government's approval has words of grace. The association also considered that the workers were coerced and blindly followed each other, which is pitiful and excusable. In order to respect the central government's intention, safeguard the interests of labor, and promote labor-management cooperation, the association repeatedly persuaded colleagues to reluctantly agree. However, legally and emotionally, it is forced. In the future, workers in this industry and other industries must not use this as a precedent, so as not to cause the association to be suspected of violating the law and bear the crime of starting it. This is the second thing that must be stated. (3) The unemployed workers return to their hometowns, and the employers provide a one-time subsidy. The association had already promised this when it sent representatives to the municipal government in January of this year, and the municipal government's No. 589 approval was considered appropriate. This time, the municipal party department and the municipal government decided to give each person a dismissal fee of 20 yuan, which will be followed. There are a total of 100 unemployed workers, and the dismissal fee should be 2,000 yuan. Herewith, we respectfully submit the attached payment, and we respectfully request that it be forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau for transfer. This subsidy is for the workers to return to their hometowns, so the issuance procedures should be detailed, and the workers should receive it from the Social Affairs Bureau with their certificates, photos, and receipts. We also pray that after the entrusted payment is made, the names, ages, and origins of the workers who received the dismissal fee will be copied to the association for reference. After this dismissal, there should be no unemployed people in the pharmaceutical industry in Shanghai. This should be stated thirdly. (4) Now that the unemployed workers have been dismissed and returned to their hometowns, the replacement worker system can no longer exist. In fact, there is naturally no unemployed worker in the workers' union. May I ask, where can we find replacement workers? The relationship is huge. Although the central government has a directive to formulate a proper method after this labor unrest is resolved, it has already been naturally resolved without any doubt. Please ask your order to forward the reasons as a final decision, so as not to cause another dispute. This is the fourth thing that should be stated. (5) Finally, the association really cannot comply with the placement of unemployed workers, because the association has repeatedly received directives from the Central Executive Committee and the Municipal Government, all of which have the words to try to employ them as soon as possible. The so-called trying to employ them as soon as possible is the right of the employers. From a business habit, if business is developed, it is natural to hire workers, and other agencies cannot force them not to hire. If other agencies forcibly stipulate the number of people that must be placed, or even specify which person should be in which store, it will undermine the employers' right to employ people. The directive to try to employ them as soon as possible is actually unavoidable. Even recently, the association received the National Government's directive on May 1, which stated that resolving labor-management disputes is not something that can be solved by coercive behavior. If this example is opened, there will be many who follow suit, and it will be even more difficult to manage. The National Government's heart cares about business difficulties and sees the crux of the matter. The association believes that what is related to one industry is small, and what is related to the whole is large. Therefore, regarding the forced placement, we cannot but respectfully ask your association to kindly forward it to the central government and withdraw the order, so that the people's lives can be saved and business can be guaranteed. This is the fifth thing that must be stated. (6) This time, Feng Jinpu, a member of the association, was arrested and handed over to the Public Security Bureau by the workers' union for being a reactionary after representing the association and petitioning in Beijing. Although he was subsequently released on bail, his personal freedom has been trampled on. It is right for businessmen to petition the central government. Is the crime of being a reactionary added to him? May I ask what the protection of human rights is for? What is the reason for Feng's arrest this time? Who reported it? May I dare to ask your association representative to inquire and give clear instructions to dispel doubts. This is the sixth thing that must be stated. The above six points, we respectfully request your association to quickly forward them and adopt them. The colleagues of the association will quietly await the following order and expect a fair solution. Furthermore, the Chamber of Commerce takes the guarantee of businessmen's happiness as a premise. Unemployed workers have no jobs and no money. If forced placement becomes a reality, then workers in all industries will follow suit, and business will go bankrupt immediately. Although it is a private worry, it must be prevented in advance. The association thinks that all the members of your association are entrusted by the central government and are expected by the merchants of the whole city. At this time of business survival, how should we strive for them and make earnest statements? Otherwise, waiting quietly for change is not what all citizens expect, nor is it what all the members of your association can tolerate in their conscience. We have stated our urgent words and await your order." Respectfully presented to the Shanghai Special Municipality Commerce Association.</p>
<h3>1929 Report of the Bank of China</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that the total import of rice was 10,824,065 piculs, equivalent to 58,986,085 taels of customs silver; the import of wheat was 5,663,857 piculs, equivalent to 21,430,817 taels of customs silver; and the import of flour was 11,935,448 piculs, equivalent to 62,900,4670 taels of customs silver. The total of these three items is equivalent to 143,321,572 taels of customs silver, equivalent to 221,750,311 silver dollars. For China, which claims to be an agricultural country, to import such a huge amount of food, it must be said that it is a matter of life and death for the Chinese people. However, those in power do not know how to stop internal strife and suppress bandits, so that the people can live in peace and engage in production, but only focus on piecemeal relief. I am afraid that the extinction of the people's livelihood and the collapse of the entire society will be imminent. The total import volume in 1929 was 1,281,675,468 customs silver taels, an increase compared to the 1,210,001,728 customs silver taels in 1928. However, the total export volume was 1,151,197,289 customs silver taels, a significant increase compared to the 1,005,387,445 customs silver taels in 1928. This shows that if the country's industry and commerce were not trapped in this kind of unstable situation, its development would be even more impressive. Secondly, the decline in the price of silver in 1929 was most significant to China's international trade relations. The lowest market price even reached 21 5/16 pence per ounce, setting the lowest record in decades. In 1929, the net import of raw silver was 127,496,680 ounces, equivalent to 105,825,976 customs silver taels. The import and export situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Import (Customs Taels) Export (Customs Taels)</p>
<p>Europe 7,056,916</p>
<p>United States 86,497,921</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Macau 22,312,430 13,116,018</p>
<p>Saigon and Tokyo 799,030 1,405,062</p>
<p>Siam 533</p>
<p>India and Burma 1,829,330 596,498</p>
<p>Korea 17,354</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies 252,652</p>
<p>Japan and Taiwan 2,960,513 77,522</p>
<p>Philippines 155,253</p>
<p>Total 121,429,514 Total 15,603,538</p>
<p>According to the above situation, the net import of raw silver was 105,825,976 customs silver taels. As a result, the silver reserves in Shanghai in 1929 also reached the highest amount. The highest amount of silver in the three years of 1926, 1928, and 1929 is listed below: Ounces</p>
<p>November 2, 1929 197,820,000</p>
<p>December 29, 1928 146,550,000</p>
<p>May 21, 1927 141,470,000</p>
<p>The increase in Shanghai's reserves in 1929 was 51,270,000 ounces. This means that out of the total import of 127,496,680 ounces in 1929, Shanghai alone absorbed 51,270,000 ounces, and the remaining 76,226,680 ounces were absorbed by various provinces. In 1929, the world's production of raw silver was 256,500,000 ounces, and the additional supply was 55,000,000 ounces, for a total increase of 311,500,000 ounces. Assuming that the annual silver production in 1930 will not be reduced compared to 1929 and that various countries will no longer sell raw silver, how will these more than 250,000,000 ounces of silver be absorbed? This is a major problem. In 1929, the use for fine arts and crafts totaled 43,000,000 ounces. Even if it slightly increases due to lower prices in 1930, it will only be 60 to 70 million ounces. However, there is still a surplus of 150,000,000 ounces. India imported 79,000,000 ounces of raw silver in 1929. Now that a raw silver import tax has been levied, there is no hope of purchasing raw silver again. Therefore, this 150,000,000 ounces will naturally be absorbed by China. Regardless of the future demand for raw silver in China and the rise and fall of the price of raw silver, as long as China maintains the silver standard for one day, it cannot escape the harm of silver price fluctuations. I sincerely hope that the government will start preparing for the reconstruction of the gold exchange standard as soon as possible, in order to seek a thorough solution. Now that customs duties are calculated in gold units, future income can be slightly increased. The increased income should be deposited as a special fund for the accumulation of gold reserves to show the government's determination to rebuild the standard. The most important thing for the implementation of the gold exchange system is the preparation of overseas gold currency. Without this preparation, all plans are empty talk. In addition, the abolition of taels for dollars and the unification of silver coins have been advocated for a long time. This is a relatively easy thing to do, but due to inertia, it has been delayed until today. Now that the strings are being changed and reforms are being made, we should also seek to realize it at the same time. If all this can be achieved sooner, then our country's prices will not be severely affected by the rise and fall of the price of silver. Industry and commerce will be able to increase their development capabilities, and international trade will naturally tend to be prosperous. The bank will be able to work hard to fulfill its duties and make some contributions to society. This is not only the bank's fortune. (End)</p>

<h3>Minutes of the 14th Meeting of the County Reorganization Committee</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Affairs Reorganization Committee held its 14th meeting yesterday. Chairman Jiang Wenbao and Recorder Xu Jiapu reported on various matters.

<h3>Replacement of the Sixth District Head of the County</h3>
<p>After the resignation of Yang Jinghai, the head of the sixth district of this county, Wang Chengyao was appointed by the county government as acting head. Upon receiving the order, former District Head Yang immediately proceeded to complete the handover procedures and sent a letter to the Fifth District Party Department to oversee the handover the day before yesterday. Due to the complexity of public property deeds, District Head Wang was unable to receive all of them at once. The county government allocated burial expenses, but all except a small portion of the expenses were misappropriated. The heads of various townships and towns believed that these were designated funds and should not be misappropriated, so they refused to acknowledge this and requested that the county government recover the funds. Therefore, the handover was not completed. After taking office, District Head Wang immediately began reorganizing the district and hired Xi Bingjun, Yang Shunfan, Zhang Zhonghua, Zhang Jingye, and others as assistants to pool the wisdom and efforts of the group. It is said that there are district head assistant positions, and apart from occasional reimbursement for transportation expenses, no salaries will be paid, to compensate for the lack of funds for the district's undertakings.</p>

<p>Art World</p>
<h3>Backgrounds in Painting by Kiwaku Nakagawa, Translated by Chen Baoyi</h3>
<p>It is very difficult to skillfully arrange the background on a painting. Whether in figure painting or still life painting, the main figure or object is not treated in isolation, but relies on the relationship with the surrounding space to realistically come alive. This does not mean that the main object is drawn first, and then the background is added arbitrarily. The background is always related to the main object, and the main object is always related to the background.</p>
<p>Suppose there are white lilies in front of a white wall. Both are white, but if you apply white paint directly, it is almost impossible to match these whites. Although they are said to be white, they have all kinds of variations, such as having a hint of blue or yellow. In this case, to see those subtle changes, you can understand it very well by comparing the color of the flower and the color of the wall.</p>
<p>Not only because of color, but also because of the relationship between the outline of the main object and the background, the softness and hardness of the object can be expressed, and the distance from the background can also be made clear. Therefore, when painting a painting, you must always pay attention to the entire surface of the painting. In order to express the main object, you must pay attention to the background. In order to express the background, you must pay attention to the main object. In this way, you continue to relate to each other, and when the main object is painted, it is the same time as painting the original background.</p>
<p>As Matisse said, in a painting, whether it is the main object or the background, there is no unnecessary part. The background is definitely not a complimentary addition. If the background does not fully perform its function as a background, then a safe picture cannot be produced.</p>
<p>It often happens that the tone of the background is too strong, or the brushstrokes are too rough, which breaks the harmony of the picture. It is only possible to maintain the rhythm of the picture by expressing the weak in a weak way and the subordinate in a subordinate way. In Japanese painting, the part that has nothing painted on it, the so-called white space, has been highly valued since ancient times. The white space in Western painting is the same. If there are shapes of things, such as figures or flowers, then you must describe them, and the image will naturally appear between the various techniques that are spent. But as for the kind of place that has a single-colored background with nothing, you don't know how to start, so it feels difficult.</p>
<p>The flatness of painting is often referred to as a drawback in painting, but this is often due to improper handling of the background.</p>
<p>You must be careful to prevent the background and the object in front from being flat like they are stuck together, and the lack of "distance" or "air" between the background and the real object.</p>
<p>Speaking of describing a room, in the case of a painting where you see the sky from the window, if it is a well-drawn painting, you can capture the feeling of the outdoor expanding into infinite space. On the contrary, a poorly drawn painting only shows that there seems to be a wall blocking it, or that the clouds seem to be stuck to the window frame. In life painting, this "air" or "sense of space" is very important. It is very difficult to capture this difficult-to-capture thing accurately.</p>
<p>Everything starts from correct observation of nature. A kind of restraint in painting techniques originally comes from observation of nature. We must never forget this point when choosing any means and methods to paint. (Selected from the manuscript translation of Oil Painting Research)</p>
<h3>The Story of a Writer by Ping</h3>
<p>Goethe's Love Spectrum</p>
<p>Goethe was born on August 28, 1749, at noon.</p>
<p>In 1764, he associated with lower-class teenagers and often wrote love letters for people. One evening, he was drinking at a friend's house, when he met the girl Klärchen. On the night of April 3 of that year, when Joseph II was crowned King of the Romans, the two held hands and indulged in the joys of love. This was Goethe's first love.</p>
<p>In 1766, he fell in love with Anna Katharina in the home of his friend Sauer in Leipzig's relative's home. Although they often scolded each other, they would soon reconcile.</p>
<p>In 1770, he studied dancing in Strasbourg. The dancing teacher there had two daughters, one named Lisette and the other named Emilie. Both girls fell in love with Goethe, but Goethe only liked the younger Emilie. Unfortunately, the older sister kissed Goethe on the face and said that whoever kissed Goethe after this would not be happy. This was considered cursing her own sister.</p>
<p>In September 1770, he rode a horse to Sessenheim, where he fell in love with Friederike Brion, the 21-year-old daughter of Pastor Brion.</p>
<p>In March 1772, he often visited the Merk family in Darmstadt. There were many beauties there, and they all fell in love with him, kissed him, danced with him, or went on excursions together. When they parted, they hugged as if they were very sad.</p>
<p>In May 1772, on the way to a dance party in Obersulzbach, twelve miles from Darmstadt, he saw a girl named Beffchen at someone's house giving bread to her younger siblings. Goethe fell in love with her. That night, they danced together at the dance party, and thus became lovers.</p>
<p>In September 1772, he separated from Beffchen and returned to the Merk family in Darmstadt, where he fell in love with Maximiliane, the sixteen-year-old daughter of the family.</p>
<p>In 1775, he fell in love with Anna Elisabeth Schönemann (also known as Lili).</p>
<p>In September 1775, he loved the W family's girl in Harzburg. This girl was very similar to his previous lover, Friederike.</p>
<p>In June 1776, he was loved by many women in Weimar, and these were all noble baronesses, duchesses, and daughters of councilors. Among them, Charlotte von Stein was the most enthusiastic, and Goethe had already admired her very much after seeing her photo.</p>
<p>In March 1776, he took a fancy to his childhood friend, the actress Corona Schröter, in Leipzig. Later, she visited Goethe in Weimar, and they reconciled. In September 1787, he traveled to Italy and fell in love with Maddalena Riggi in one place.</p>
<p>In June 1788, he returned to Weimar and suddenly met a woman named Christiane Vulpius in the park, and then fell in love. Finally, he married this woman.</p>
<p>In May 1814, when he went to Bad Berka, he met a woman named Marianne, the wife of someone, and in September the woman came to visit Goethe, so they had an affair again.</p>
<p>In July 1822, when Goethe was 73 years old, he still fell in love with a girl who was only sixteen years old, and even wanted to marry her. Goethe said, "Artists often have a period of breaking the ice."</p>
<h3>The Love of the Poet Schiller</h3>
<p>Schiller was born on November 10, 1759. In December 1782, due to financial difficulties, he was introduced by a widow to Bauerbach, where he fell in love with a seventeen-year-old girl named Charlotte Wolzogen, but the girl's mother did not allow him to marry her.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-five, he fell in love with a seventeen-year-old girl named Margarethe. In the same year, he also fell in love with Mrs. Kalb.</p>
<p>In 1785, near Trasdorf, he fell in love with Marie Arnold, the daughter of a count. This was also because the girl's mother did not allow them to marry.</p>
<p>In 1787, he returned to Bauerbach, where he fell in love with Lengefeld, a relative of Wolzogen. Only then was he congratulated on his marriage.</p>
<p>Lord Lytton, Who Early Tasted the Flavors of Love</p>
<p>Lord Lytton, in the position of a writer, occupies a first-class reputation in the British literary world of the 19th century. He is called the model of long-sleeved literature, and his life is often entangled in love.</p>
<p>He was already in love with a girl at the age of thirteen. In the shade of the forest, by the flowing stream, he was already obsessed with the sweet love when he was young.</p>
<p>It was once rumored that Caroline Lamb, who had a relationship with Byron, also had a relationship with Lytton.</p>
<p>The letters of love he published were the love letters he had with his wife, Mrs. Hare.</p>
<p>He served as a member of parliament for ten years, and was subsequently ennobled as a baronet and served as a colonial governor until the end of his life. He was born in Cambridge in 1803 and died in 1873.</p>
<h3>Stories of World Literature (1) (5) (5) by John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 18: French Poetry in the Nineteenth Century</p>
<p>The poet who possessed both classical learning and elegance, while also attempting pleasant and humorous pranks, was Pierre Louÿs. His "Songs of Bilitis," which he pretended to be translations from Greek, were entirely in the Greek style in terms of tone and content, to the extent that some young critics were deceived, while older critics examined his "Greek flavor" with approving seriousness. Louÿs was called a decadent, but such a beautiful decadent is full of allure and completely harmless.</p>
<p>Now that Ducarmel and Anatole France are dead, the French literary world probably almost unanimously recognizes Jules Laforgue as their leader and master. However, the king of the chosen poets (the method of election is completely unclear) is Paul Fort, a robust and prolific poet who publishes his "French Ballads" one after another, drawing on all aspects of French life that can be imagined and from the history of Louis X to 1914. He is vigorous and prolific, superficially reckless and rebellious, but beneath all this, he is also a very careful author who pays homage to the traditional forms that any Frenchman, perhaps even a true literary scholar, cannot extricate himself from. Fort writes his poems in prose form, but when you read them aloud, you feel, or rather hear, that most of the poems are perfect and straightforward poems. The most captivating thing that this poet possesses is the outpouring of his endless treasure of illusions, his fertile invention, and his mastery of all emotions from chaotic moodiness to gentle sorrow and the indignation seen in some of his war poems. War literature is mostly journalistic, dull, and uninteresting, but Paul Fort's poems may continue to have life. Why? Because he was born and raised in the shadow of the Reims Cathedral.</p>
<p>Far weaker and less masculine than Fort is the artist who is sick in content, the pale and gloomy poet Samain. Although he has his weary sorrow, he is what he hoped to do in his poem "Virgile": "pure, beautiful, and radiant flame."</p>
<p>Some poets who have left the tide of French poetry, but who are warmly welcomed and encouraged by the editor of "French Mercure," are Francis Jammes, who lives far from the mad crowd in the Pyrenees. He writes beautiful stories based on local legends. The farmers or mountain people he describes seem to be real, at least his poetic grammar is "the voice of man." I do not intend to place him at the high point of modern French poetry, but there is a title of all his that seems suitable to end this short chapter or any chapter about poetry, and that is "The Victory of Life."</p>

<h3>Merchant Marine School Students Visit Japanese Ship</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chichibu Maru, a ship from the Japanese Mail Steamship Company (Nippon Yusen Kaisha) on its maiden voyage to Shanghai, had faculty and staff members from the Ministry of Transportation's Wusong Merchant Marine School lead more than 30 students on a visit. The ship's first officer personally greeted them. After visiting the general areas, they were led to the bridge, which ordinary guests cannot easily access. Inside, there was an echo sounder, a rotating compass that does not use magnets, a radio direction finder, and a propeller counter that shows the number of revolutions per minute. All of these are unavailable in our country's current merchant ships. He provided detailed explanations and demonstrations. The ship's hull has eight sections of longitudinal bulkheads that separate them, so if one area is damaged and flooded, it can be prevented from flowing into other compartments. The raising and lowering of the bulkhead hatches are controlled by electric buttons, which can be opened and closed with a light press. Alarm systems are installed in all rooms and cargo holds, regardless of size. In the event of a fire, an electrical alarm will sound, immediately indicating its location. All of the above machines are installed on the bridge, so the bridge is actually the central control point for all the ship's machinery. The lower-level engine room contains two engines, not made by the Japanese themselves, with a horsepower of 26,000. All machinery is driven by electricity. Compared to the equipment on our country's merchant ships, it far surpasses them. The students were filled with emotion after the visit, and so on.</p>
<h3>Drama Society Performs "The Merchant of Venice"</h3>
<p>Yesterday and the day before were the first performances of Shakespeare's masterpiece "The Merchant of Venice" by the Drama Association. The scenery was magnificent, the costumes were colorful, and the play's tone was clear and audible, and the actors' performances were especially outstanding. There were more than a dozen foreign visitors, including Professor and Mrs. Lamb from Shanghai University, and Professor Peter, who brought more than ten female students to watch the play. The play lasted four hours, but at the end, the audience showed no signs of fatigue and were reluctant to leave. The second performance is scheduled for the 24th and 25th of this month. Tickets are still sold at the Modern Bookstore on Sima Road, the Crescent Bookstore, the Hongkou Commercial Press, and the Ximen Bookstore.</p>
