<p>下月一日各路齊復原狀</p>
<p>近日配航攬儎至爲忙碌</p>
<p>昨今兩年國内戰事不息江海華輪均告停航今年交通處粗用之商船在最多時達七十餘艘以致外輪乘機活躍國内航商在運輸業上損失以千萬計迨至本年九月底軍事告終船舶亦放回不少十月份内又以剿辦湘贛匪共移軍長江流域益以魯陳各師改防皖中故又續租十八輪以資運送今則剿匪之師巳到目的地差用各輪業經悉數放滬久經輟班之江海各船至是始告全部復航從十二月一日起不論南北洋揚子江各路之中國商船均可回復正班不獨爲航業絶續之交抑且爲國輪再興之機邇日各公司之計劃復興支配路線甚形忙煩當有紀載之價値</p>
<p>海輪全數歸滬　自上星期公平·新昌·唐山·等船釋歸後現在海輪之未經放行者僅祇華陽·與圖南·兩船耳在昨日招商局乘造報十月十一月租船金册時又電京請將此二船速放蓋十二月一日爲國輪各路全復正班之第一日須支配航行者聞交通處巳經允諾儘在本月以内將兩海輪放滬結果租船手續</p>
<p>江輪四艘即回　長江船在最多之時共租二十餘艘今則除放來外祇留江天·德興·伏龍·鳳浦·醒獅·等船今三北招商迭請放行後至遲在月底亦可返滬在長江線内自去年起行駛華輪通常不過六艘而又時輟時開今則戰停船放沿江又經海軍護航下月一日起招商局之長江輪可復開八輪上江四輪三北可開五輪上江五輪寗紹肇興可開三輪回復未戰時之班數近日各公司對於攬儎之進行競爭至爲劇烈</p>
<p>北洋即行正班　北洋正班久巳中輟今招商局新銘雖開新豐又被日輪景山丸撞壞來滬大修昨經查明貨物與船身兩項損失達四萬元巳向日郵社近海社交涉索賠矣現該局擬華陽圖南放歸後下月一日起將北洋輪派定（一）天津正班三艘新豐·新銘·遇順（二）大連班圖南或華陽（三）海州班同華而南華輪亦定一號起復正班</p>
<p>各船停班一覽　自上年至現在各華輪供中央租用停班者時間之長船舶之多實足驚人每輪每日租用自三百元至一百元不等二年來之租金亦須數百萬元茲軍運結束租金亦在結付各船所停航之日期僅招商局一家巳經可觀茲將上年各船軍運日數與本年九月止之停航日查誌如下亦可以見一斑矣</p>

<p>巿商會昨日上午在大禮堂舉行總理紀念週到全體辦事員及各業代表百餘人值日委員勞敬修主席行禮如儀畢即由該會常務委員土延松報告四中全會與工商業之關係茲紀其演詞如下</p>
<p>各位代表本週内最重要的一件事當然是四中全會完滿的成功我想四中全會的告成不但是本週乃至本年一件要重的事實在在中國革命成功史上佔居了極重要的一頁因爲這是肅淸殘餘軍閥後開始建設的一个新紀元無論在黨務方面政治方面經濟方面都有切實的决議具體的規定並且對於以前的錯誤下了一个極嚴重的糾正　我想中央委員這種大公誠摯的精神實在可以引起全國民衆一致之欽仰與擁護憑了這一點誠摯的精神自然全會閉幕以後一定能夠將各項决議案一步的做去决不如胡院長在四中全會開會詞中所說的那種會議會通的毛病所謂議而不决决而不行行而不通了四中全會對於商業方面也有了一個狠重大狠密切的决議案就是振興實業决議於民國二十年一月一日實行廢除厘金我想我們在商會内辦事這裁厘的聲浪當然聽得很多而且所得很厭煩了國民政府成立以後也曾經召集會議討論辦法發布命令規定日期可是事實上沒有能切實做到對於抵補厘金的消費稅儘管巳經實行了多時可是厘金還是依然在那裡徵收我們要問爲什麽政府不能辦到裁厘金第一個大障礙實在是殘餘軍閥的割據一方面這些軍閥他們爲了擴充私人地盤招兵添將買槍購砲可是這些槍砲兵將非錢不行於是中央政府的財政統一就辦不通他們在割據的幾個省分裡依然要抽收厘金或者還要特别加重的收稅這樣一下自然裁厘受了極大的障礙難怪中央政府縱有决議也是行而不通現在好了軍閥完全肅淸眞正的統一也經實現此後中央政令旣可遍及全國當然財政統一不成問題國民政府遵照四中全會决議案下一道命令定於二十年一月一日裁撤厘金試問那個省分還敢違抗厘金裁撤了我們商民所感受的數十年秕政一旦解除此後工商業的發展自在意中這是極值得慶幸的一件大事還有一件對於商民而且不但是商民很有切膚關係的事情就是嚴行剿匪一兩年來商民所受匪共的痛苦眞是一言難盡就近一點來說譬如江北的猪運業就受了泰與一帶匪共的蹂𨈆擄人刦貨視爲常事這樣下去非但貨運不能通暢而且要商號裹足現在四中全會巳决定嚴行剿匪蔣主席並將巡視匪共蹂𨈆最烈的的湘贛鄂三省至於首都所在地和鄰近的江浙兩省自然也十分注意最近時間當可肅淸此後匪共旣可肅淸厘金又實行裁撤我想商界方面一定能彀達到「貨暢其流」的地步了其他定期召集國民會議集中人才改善制度完成地方自治四大點均爲全國民衆一致之願望此次四中全會均有明白之决議以前各種事項均因受殘餘軍閥割據之影響中央忙於討逆軍事現在閻馮巳去黨國基礎日即穩固四中全會旣巳有此决議則此後政府當負遵守之責任而在人民方面亦須竭力贊襄注重實際工作對於以前口號標語的口頭工作上文章及一切無裨實際的會議均應一一减少大家舊發精神埋首工作切切實實的做去我想三年五年以後成效一定很可觀了兄弟覺得四中全會與工商業關係的重要將他提出來作一個簡單的報告末由職員演講黨義「題爲甘地不合作主義」</p>

<p>運毒日商行號　在滬第一次抄查漏下被提去三箱而第二次之六箱又來簽提者均係日本商行ＭｃｉｓｂｏＣｏ名義而第二次之六箱在簽提出貨時仍被海關扣留發見均是海落英刻下巳經查明該行之華文名稱係明松洋行而兩次九件均是其承領之貨餘則槪不承認</p>
<p>輪局電意查詢　江海關在查獲此巨量毒品後即派員到意輪公司澈查上海承辦之商家意公司出示提單乃並無簽提行號之預注故無從得知其購買者邇日以拒毒會之查詢意郵公司亦欲明瞭該貨之來踪去跡昨巳發電至Ｆｒｉｅｓｔｅ曲禮亞斯德總行請問該貨報裝之Ｉｒａｎｓｐｏｒｔ　Ｌｎｔｅｒｎａｔｉｏｎａｕｘ家向之詰詢此貨在上海大連天津三地之購買行號及貨主名稱請即速查明詳細情由後發電來滬以資明瞭一俟該總行復到此項私運毒品之東方機關當可得知矣</p>
<p>來貨逐件開騐　自此案發生以後江海關巳發通諭凡屬由歐美運來上海之貨向來抽騐者今則看令騐貨員須逐件開箱檢騐不得敷衍了事以杜毒品流入故自近日之歐洲貨到滬騐看十分認眞提貨手續因之異常煩瑣矣</p>

<h3 id="c172">玉堂春戲詞之研究 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 少卿</p>
<p>荀慧生唱玉堂春（高亭公司有此片亦有程艶秋唱玉堂春元板）二六洞云「打發公子回原郡二人在燈前把誓盟公子立志不另娶玉春堂至死不嫁人」艶秋詞則與此不同艶秋詞云「自從公子南京去玉堂春在北樓妝病情公子若是不娶妾玉堂春守節不嫁人」一言分别之夜燈下盟誓一不言盟誓只言公子去後玉堂春妝病又老詞云「打發公子回南京二人在神前把誓盟」則言在關王廟分别神前盟詞是燈前神前待考戲詞之不同如此</p>
<p>又皮黃詞中東轍與人臣轍絶不通用而玉堂春老詞有「王金龍」「到洪桐」「臉緋紅」等下句「龍」「桐」「紅」等字皆中東轍不可通用今艶秋詞「王金龍」改爲」三舍人」「臉緋紅」「改爲」「臉含眞」獨「到洪桐」一句仍未改桐字仍不免出轍爲之設想恰當改句實難得也</p>
<p>老詞「三萬六千銀一旦化了灰塵」有人謂三萬六千兩銀子非「一旦」所能盡故艶秋改爲「一概」「旦」「概」皆去聲字於腔不生變化亦無妨也</p>
<p>生詞「做媒的銀子三百兩」而艶秋詞則爲「一百兩」究竟三百兩抑一百兩是一小問題觀其前唱有「初見面紋銀三百兩又白口中亦有「用手一約有三百餘兩」若再來一個三百兩嫌重複故以一百兩爲妥此種數目皆編書編戲人隨意寫出並非事實故無大關係三字須高唱一字低出可矣</p>
<p>「先打金杯和玉盞」是老詞今多沿用金杯可打玉盞不可打也故此打字宜改爲買字</p>
<p>「後買翠盤與翠瓶」亦普通詞今艶秋改爲「又買翠盤與花瓶」此處無大關係</p>
<p>「鴇兒貪財將我賣將我賣與沈燕齡」此艶秋詞甚佳普通詞無賣與沈燕齡明文致一馬到洪桐之句無根據</p>
<p>「一馬到洪桐」言受鴇兒之騙賣與沈燕齡假說王公子得中令玉堂春至天齊廟燒香酬神乃一直賺到洪桐縣沈家也以理度之玉堂春必乘轎而往絶非乘馬若乘馬不至被賺到洪桐也詞云一馬或誤或曰「一馬」係某地方一種成語如南京人口頭語「馬上就去」言其去之快也絶非乘馬可斷言者今人喜改詞而於詞多不澈底何耶</p>
<p>最特别者爲慧生唱至「犯婦本當不招認」忽加唱「我的大老爺」五個襯字每聆此片至此句感覺一種特别滋味人皆不知其來歷蓋由梆子而來此戲本山西省故事原爲梆子班本子皮黃班改作而慧生幼年擅梆子故加此也此五字他人皆無</p>
<p>程荀二人玉堂春詞巳大有出入限於篇幅從略若再以梅蘭芳尙小雲及老詞相較其異同處更不勝枚舉玉堂春爲靑衣必學之劇詞句之間須加選擇故略舉數端以供參考</p>

<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（二十四）　的大連</p>
<p>走出泰華樓和老楊借乘了朋友的汽車於是我們到了常盤橋常盤座的門前</p>
<p>常盤座是一個建築得很有趣味的劇院舞臺面是一層層深入的圓門式的</p>
<p>據老楊說日活座的建築也是很有趣味而牠正同常盤相反舞臺面是方的</p>
<p>所映的片子並不新道格拉斯范朋克的三劍客在一年前就在上海映放過了的在舞臺的右角有一日本人譯讀字幕這同香港的劇院是一樣的</p>
<p>座前後的日本女人的妖艶的脂粉香實在令人作嘔奇怪日本女人爲什麽喜歡用這種極度剌激的香料這也表現了日本的特性我覺得總帶有野蠻的氣味如她們的大袖和服與木屣一樣關於和服與木屣我不解慣於趨新的日本爲什麽却沒有把牠們改良（？）這也許是如保守着那些佛像寺院和種種古怪的習俗一樣是要顯出這些他們日本人可以代表東方民族嗎</p>
<p>本來老楊要領我去看日本武士道類的戲劇和舞踊但我不願去因爲怕走了進去不等看完就走出來這太不經濟了</p>
<p>影片映完了在紛雜而討厭的木屣聲中我們也走出了常盤然而舒展在眼前的有靜趣的街巿是我所最愛的這些是内街不通車馬的在頭頂上還覆着布綳只有托托托地木屣的聲音響着街燈也顯得十分淸閑雖然行人也很多</p>
<p>這些與哈爾濱的夜巿有着異趣而更不若上海之夜的噪嚷而紛亂</p>
<p>我們再走進了銀雀座這是一處茶室也許這就如在東方有名的東京的Cnfe一樣吧</p>
<p>一個大槪只有十六歲的日本侍女很活潑地走來問我們吃點什麽我是不懂日文的沒有和她對話的幸福（？）自然只有讓老楊去跟她說了</p>
<p>奇怪我不知道日本人對於橘子蘋菓之類的名詞爲什麽都由英文的音譯Icecream一字在我國的南方也特别奇怪一半音譯一半義譯在北方則完全義譯呌「冰糕」也許是「冰　」在日本乃完全音譯</p>
<p>將我們所要吃的東西吃完了於是走出銀雀座</p>
<p>慢慢地走着漸漸地遠離了美麗的夜的都巿走入墨暗而濁亂的街裹來—中國人所囂聚的地方你隨便地可以嗅得雅片的氛氣和聽得到人們口角的聲音我的確感到我們這文明民族的野蠻</p>

<p>— 文質</p>
<p>谷劍塵著</p>
<p>三幕劇</p>
<p>中國劇劇的生命到什麽時候才能充實起來呢照目前的情熊委實是遙遙無期呵社會的一般的接受依然是沉緬於拙劣的表現和醜惡的技術底舊劇中無論舊劇是那樣不合時宜那樣沒有藝術的意味而他們的陶醉還是感到非常的興趣而且在事實上戲劇更是吊在半空中所謂在這方面努力的有多少好的表現給我們看呢就是單以量來說吧站足於劇壇的塲合的一共有幾多人我們可以幾多數目字來代表在這方面旣巳貧乏得可以自然還那裹說得上其他諸問題呢這也許因爲戲劇在中國尚沒有得到重量的剌激的緣故致一直下來總是沒落在消沉的危機裹吧我們一看這種破碎支離的局面將會　發了怎樣的感想</p>
<p>關於舞臺的藝術的表現我們更不能談了在一年中我們能看到多少次公演所掀起的力量會是多少但屢於這我們似乎也不能多所苛責的固然劇本因缺少舞臺技術的帮助在技術上或會不很完美我們必需要等到有了好的新的舞臺之後我們纔會有着代表新的精神而且有完美的技術的劇本出現可是在目前我們的境域還沒有到達這一步的程度我們的力量還夠不上負起這副重擔在多方面的昭示可以知道我們戲劇底發展會是劇本較先於舞臺的現在巳經有一點這種傾向的趨勢在最近的將來却也還要如此這自然是因爲劇本的進展較之舞臺可以少受到一些妨礙我相信中國戲劇的發皇的徵兆必定是在於一種有摔掉一切的勇敢大膽的劇本出現代表一種新的精神的東面所以我們現在最急切的工作我們是仍然要爲戲劇作防禦的戰爭宣傳解釋和反抗以達到社會眞實的認識和接受以促進我們得的舞臺因之我們戲劇的新生這種浪潮的冲激絶非偶然的事我們需要怎樣利用我們的力去積極的開始</p>
<p>然而這種新時代的啓現將始於何時我尙無解答的義務這要看我們戲劇的空氣的寒暑表如何而定尤其劇本的質和量的發展是先决的條件</p>
<p>上面對於中國戲劇的本身問題不覺談了一些我的意思戲劇藝術創造之難是實在的事但因此即畏懼不前是不值得的現在來談到谷劍塵君的「楊小姐的密秘」吧我固然不想說這本劇本能收到怎樣的效果不過在今日的劇壇上該算是一本較好的作品了谷君年來共發表了二篇劇作一是「紳董」一即是這本「楊小姐的秘密」「紳董」當在後來再介紹這本「楊小姐的秘密」好像巳是有人家上演過的成績還不差那末在舞臺的方面似乎也巳得它的評價了</p>
<p>「楊小姐的秘密」的故事是這樣</p>
<p>新任公安局長鄭烈的第一個德政是實行禁睹他認到了「行政長官在那地方留下壤事績易同反掌成功了一件美政却難於登天我現在找到了那樣的好機會眞不是一件容易求得着的我不能放過」（九十頁）於是下了甚大的决心要取締輪盤睹窟大華俱樂部他不受土豪劣紳周吉仄的運動誓要「在我職權之下我當然不能呌這種害人的破壞治安的機關有一天的存在」但他却並不知道這大華俱樂部的主人究竟是誰他對於自己的身世尙未有理淸他不知道這大華俱樂部的主人原來就是他的名義上的姊姊而實是母親的楊小姐所經管的於是便使楊小姐的秘密在這無可奈何中掀發了</p>
<p>楊小姐明白情形愈弄愈糟糕在種種煩亂心緒的交戰中亟想設法收歇大華她知道再弄下去恐將更對不起人不過是望能有和平的解决面子不落空而且她也因周吉仄「那種對我糾纒不淸的樣子我先覺得他可怕所以我想把大華收歇了省得他藉口保護人的資格再向我晩𣋼囌」（五八頁）然終因環境關係�</p>
<p>未能脫身同時又爲吉仄所激她要不顧一切自己來對付鄭烈要他顧念往事不過分追究大華而網開一面放人走條自新之路但結果她旣也不好直接用自己是主人的名義來說便只得假設是同情大華的女主人的身世以婉轉的話語來勸告奈始終遭拒絶自然她悲痛異常可是還設詞來自擬處處插八「假使是我」的隱射後來她終於在不可遏制的緊張中沉痛的斷斷續續地傾吐了楊小姐的身世「她是河南洛陽地方的人她是女子師範的畢業生……她在十七歲就做寡婦了丈夫死後不到五七生了她那苦命的孩子可是她丈夫早沒有爹媽的了她丈夫的遺產就害了她無賴的族人欺她孤弱覬覦財產逼她改嫁她孤單一個人沒有法子對付他們愛惜名譽愛惜孩子才想了種種法子脫險逃到上海起先想找她的同學帮她的忙不願再去受他們族人欺侮她又生成驕傲脾氣想經濟獨立養活自己孩子呢孩子也當然帶到</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>上海來的　爲了她的孩子所以她敢冐着這個危險後來她找了一個敎書的活兒可是在小學堂敎書能有幾塊錢一月上海生活程度又高呌她怎樣過去她沒有法子只得接受她的同學潘小姐的勸告組織大華俱樂部她想到做工可是沒有辦到她自己知道可走的路都不能維持母子兩人的生活她才得巳跟了潘小姐去幹那非人的生活總而言之她是勉强生活着的人她要不死沒有好的法子」乃鄭烈只是一味的刻薄着充分地咒着那女子「姊姊你是怎樣淸高的人你不能比她的」於是她最後只有决計出走了在預備出走的一晚上一切都佈置好了不料在自己家裹又生出了殺人案給公安局的密探認出了人一起捉住待鄭烈懷着一肚子怪胎跑來事巳成眞末了楊小姐留下最後這幾句話「我爲我兒子爲了母子之情在這世界上受着無形鐐銬的痛苦過着無形監獄的生活精神上永沒有舒服的一天如今我的擺脫了去受有形鐐銬的痛苦過有形監獄的生活精神上到底痛快得多了……」鄭烈只儘癡立不語一條條把楊小姐預備着留給她的信撕作粉碎這悲劇也於此告終</p>
<p>此篇共分三幕第一幕寫鄭烈表兄君陶家得悉妻子靜芳在大華輸去不少錢而責備以至發生齟齬這是作者先埋伏了賭塲的引綉良人墮落周吉仄的運動也在這一幕寫出的作者似很是聰明他在第三幕中再把君陶靜芳二人的故事放入以相呼應而且作者並不把這鎗殺的悲劇施之於楊小姐而加之靜芳身上爲一種緊張襯托這種結構是值得讚美的至於作者表現力的頂高點我以爲是在第二幕末在那些對話中也十足地包含了我們所要研究的社會問題</p>
<p>楊小姐　比方你剛抱在懷裹的時候家鄉遇了天災爹媽全死去了我們這漂流到上海我沒有同生活奮鬥的精神順不得姊弟的情分把你抛棄了或者像你所說的决心抱了你去跳海那末到今天可還有你這個大學政治經濟科畢業的公安局長嗎一那位楊小姐要養她無父無家的孩子又要培植他使他成個有用的人材她不得不多想收點進益她才沒法子所以走那條容易走的路當然很可以原諒牠的</p>
<p>鄭烈　可是不知道原諒她也不能拿姊姊來比牠姊姊爲了我一個個人同社會奮鬥沒有拿着像賭窟那樣齷齪的金錢來養得我培植我</p>
<p>楊小姐　我沒有拿那樣齷齪的金錢來養活你培植你正是我的幸福……說起來……傷心</p>
<p>鄭烈　爲了保全他們母子兩個呌整個的社會不安起來呌整個的社會去受她們的犠牲這是我鄉最痛心不過的</p>
<p>楊小姐　你……一定……要……呌她……抱着……她的兒子……去跳……海嗎……你……安得……這樣……殘酷的心腸嗎</p>
<p>鄭烈　可是也要比較利害輕重不能呌重大的犧牲在小犧牲手裹</p>
<p>楊小姐　可是現在的世界沒有呌人人生活安定也所異於逼人生活不要安定那位楊小姐假使能找到相當的女子職業她决不願意走那條路社會逼迫她社會有重大的犧牲還是該由社會担當這個責任總之她是好人她是一個可憐的女子所以才定走到這種悲慘的地步</p>
<p>鄭烈　我不願意有這種見解…無論如何爲了維持他們母子一個簡單的家庭呌許多家庭的幸福爲她破產是不應該的一個一抱着犧牲自己去救整個的社會許多的家庭才能得有眞的偉大人格爲了一個人先呌社會不安定起來呌少數犧牲多數總是說不過去的何况把許多人犧牲來的金錢　培植一個人材未必能夠靠得住呢</p>
<p>這些我們要是以社會的眼光看來公平的分析一下那未我們的結論對於楊小姐這樣的身世而形成這樣的行動將是鄙棄抑是尊敬呢</p>
<p>當他勸靜芳的時候他的話也多麽眞切</p>
<p>傅物之　請别那麽說你們先生也是圖你好深愛着你所以對於過大一點言重一點他是一片苦心你很可以原諒他的</p>
<p>你們傅先生看得你高所不願你有什麽過失他的賣備你正是他眞心表現的地方他看重你尊敬你才把你五分的過失當做了十分的過失你不必氣的</p>
<p>這也許是告誡一般新女子的吧</p>
<p>思想方面作者容或還沒有澈底總在這三幕中有的地方使我摸不到作者一貫的思想的最高點是在那裹這是爲作者所惜的</p>
<p>至於在藝術的這一個階段上有些地方可看出作者叙述手腕的不經濟有些詞句可以减省的而有些詞句則應加重使劇情更臻於力的型子裹其次結搆鬆懈的地方也在所不免但這祗我是個人的意思好在不是作劇評我的主旨是介紹同時也是實獻於作者的　意</p>
<p>總之在目前貧乏的劇壇上這本三幕劇「楊小姐的秘密」是比較值得一讀的作者對於戲劇的態度是忠實的我希望作者今後繼續努力來爲中國戲劇盡開拓的責任從更有力的創作上表現</p>

<p>Nanjing, the 24th. Chiang met with Zhao Shouyu, the Pacification Commissioner of Shanxi, and Shanxi representatives Wang Yongbin, Zhao Jin'ao, and Gong Fukui, among others, at the headquarters at 11 AM. Kong Xiangxi was also present. They discussed the resolution of the Shanxi situation for a long time. Wang Yongbin first reported on the unspeakable suffering of the people of Shanxi due to Yan's indiscriminate issuance of military banknotes, and submitted a plan for the aftermath. Chiang has agreed to accept it. Next, Zhao Shouyu presented a plan for resolving the Shanxi situation, which Chiang was very satisfied with. He also ordered Zhao to handle the aftermath of the internal Shanxi army. Finally, Gong Fukui presented a plan for military aftermath. Chiang ordered him to contact Deputy Commander Zhang and Zhao Shouyu for handling. They left around one o'clock after the talks. According to Zhao Jin'ao, the best way to resolve the Shanxi situation is for the central government to thoroughly resolve the military affairs of Shanxi and hand them over to Pacification Commissioner Zhao. It would be especially appropriate for the central government to send another senior official to preside over political affairs. (24th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Nationality Problem in Poland <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The issue of ethnic minorities is also one of the international problems that urgently needs to be resolved today. This was discussed at the League of Nations meeting the other day, but no practical solution was reached, only encouraging mutual understanding between the majority and minority ethnic groups. However, is it easy to achieve mutual understanding between the majority and minority ethnic groups? In recent years, the conflicts between ethnic minorities in various countries have been largely due to the inability of the majority ethnic groups to treat all ethnic minorities equally. The so-called ethnic movements were originally just a kind of rebellious attitude discovered in the psychology of oppressed people. If the majority ethnic groups can always take into account the interests and status of the minority ethnic groups and never add any pressure, then the minority ethnic groups will naturally be able to eliminate their resentment and anger, and they can live in peace. But today's majority ethnic groups know this but cannot implement it. After Poland's restoration, the domestic ethnic issues became very complex. In addition to the Russian and Austrian peoples, it is especially difficult to reconcile with a part of the German ethnic group. Coupled with the entanglement of border issues, it is becoming more and more alienated today. From an outsider's perspective, Poland, having been under the tyranny of powerful countries and suffering the pain of oppression for over a hundred years and the tragedy of national subjugation, should have some kind of awakening and treat the different ethnic groups within its borders with more leniency. However, the Polish people believe that what they once suffered from others can now be returned to them. Therefore, in the past decade, the animosity between the ethnic groups in Poland has deepened. Today, in preparation for the election, the Polish people have insulted the candidates of the German ethnic group and besieged the schools of the Germans, which is enough to arouse the anger of the German ethnic group. Not only will the conflicts between ethnic groups become more severe, but it will also lead to international resentment. Is this not Poland's misfortune?</p>

<p>Nanjing. Sources in diplomatic circles say that Mo, the representative of the Soviet Union, has not yet received a reply to the protest he made to Karakhan on the 17th. The conference is still at a standstill. The conference can only continue if Soviet Russia has the sincerity to negotiate. (24th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Moscow. The documents exchanged between Mo Dehui and Karakhan in the Sino-Russian negotiations will be made public this month. According to these documents, Mo Dehui stated that the Chinese side cannot blindly recognize the Buriat Agreement, while Karakhan demanded that recognition of this agreement be a prerequisite to avoid further disputes between China and Russia. The Sino-Russian negotiations cannot be resolved due to this issue, and have effectively come to a complete standstill. In the exchange of documents, both sides expressed the hope to reopen negotiations. (23rd Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>Moscow. Karakhan, the chief representative of the Soviet Union in the Sino-Russian talks, stated in a letter to Mo Dehui, chairman of the Chinese delegation, that he was dissatisfied with Mo's recent declaration regarding the administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Karakhan wrote to Mo, saying that the Soviet government believes that it is now necessary to clearly state that arbitrary and unilateral actions regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway cannot be tolerated, as such actions have caused serious harm to the peace and diplomatic relations between China and Russia in 1929. According to Karakhan's first letter to Mo Dehui on November 11, the Buriat Agreement can be said to have been fulfilled in terms of the situation in the three eastern provinces. It is no longer an obstacle to starting discussions on the Chinese Eastern Railway and the commercial and diplomatic relations between China and Russia. He believes that the Republic of China will be able to accept the Soviet Union's suggestion to start negotiations in order to lay a solid foundation for friendly relations between China and Russia.

<p>National News dispatch from Berlin, 23rd – In areas within Polish territory with a larger German population, conflicts between the German and Polish ethnic groups have continued for ten years. Yesterday and today, in preparation for the Senate elections and the Silesian regional assembly elections, incidents have occurred again. In one location, a Polish parade carried a wooden effigy of a German official in a gallows, with a banner stating that anyone wishing to elect a German candidate would be treated like this official. In another town, Polish demonstrators surrounded a German school for seven hours, preventing the children from returning home. Although these are minor incidents, continued conflict will not benefit the region or the nation. Since Poland's independence, the position of Germans within the country has reversed, and the Polish authorities are striving for assimilation, while the German ethnic group is determined to preserve its national essence, leading to increasing friction, making it one of the most difficult minority issues to resolve.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Promotes Five-Year Industrial Plan</p>
<h3 id="e55">Labor Militarization <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Workers Cannot Change Jobs Mid-Term</p>
<p>Breaking Oath Punished with Six Months of Starvation</p>
<p>Telecommunications Agency Moscow dispatch – According to recent laws and unofficial announcements issued by the Soviet Union regarding labor, workers no longer have the right to choose or change their occupations. Although workers are nominally allowed to choose their jobs, they must be prepared to starve if they want to choose a different occupation. The Soviet Union's five-year industrialization plan aims for rapid implementation, preventing workers from seeking easier jobs and disliking new industries, hence the need for these extraordinary measures. The Soviet industrial plan, which encompasses the five-year plan, not only requires a large number of workers but also subjects these workers to military-style training. The government will, if necessary, send large armies of workers to lumber yards, fisheries, and construction sites. During the necessary period, these workers are prohibited from switching to other industries. Tens of thousands of workers in factories, mines, and other labor sites must sign oaths not to leave their posts until the five-year plan is completed. Signing the oath is ostensibly voluntary, but in reality, it is mandatory. Anyone unwilling to sign the oath is considered an economic saboteur and a traitor to the motherland, to be judged by special revolutionary tribunals. Furthermore, the Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party recently issued a notice stating that those who frequently change jobs or violate the above-mentioned oath will be punished with six months of being banned from engaging in industry. The only way to avoid this six-month starvation period is for the workers not to abandon their jobs. The notice also states that workers can be transferred from one place to another at will, just like the general staff can arbitrarily deploy troops. The entire notice uses military terminology, aiming to mobilize the workers to fight on the five-year plan front, stating: (1) Anyone who evades assigned work, regardless of the reason, will be immediately removed from the labor registry at the labor exchange. This removal means unemployment and starvation, which is the only way to send tens of thousands of workers to lumber yards, mines, and industrial areas in Siberia. (2) Government authorities can transfer skilled workers or specialists from one sector of the national economy to another more important sector, and severe punishments will be imposed on those who refuse to be transferred. (3) The registration of skilled workers for administrative tasks will be suspended for a total of two years.</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from Berlin, 23rd – A correspondent for a Berlin newspaper in Moscow, upon arriving in Berlin today, denied rumors of an anti-Soviet revolution, stating that although there was no revolution in Russia this month, there has been turmoil behind the scenes within the Communist Party for a long time. This undercurrent reached its peak during the Communist Party Congress, and the result, at the very least, is that opponents and supporters of Stalin have temporarily compromised with each other. In practice, the opposition party can be said to have failed. The goal of the internal struggles within the Communist Party is to compete for power, not to overthrow the Bolshevik system, he said.</p>

<p>Chiang Kai-shek, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Xueliang, Yu Youren, members of the National Government, and Zhang Zhijiang, Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, held a swearing-in ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 10:30 a.m. on the 24th.

Chairman Hu Hanmin of the National Government first played music and performed the ceremony. Then, the seal-bestowal ceremony took place, with Chairman Hu Hanmin bestowing seals upon Chiang Kai-shek, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, and Zhang Zhijiang, Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, in order. Next, the swearing-in ceremony took place, with Central Committee member Wu Jingheng presiding over the oath-taking. Chiang Kai-shek, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Xueliang, Yu Youren, members of the National Government, and Zhang Zhijiang, Jiangsu Pacification Commissioner, all raised their right hands and took the oath. After the oath-taking, the oath-taker and the chairman delivered speeches, which are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Oath-taker Wu Jingheng's speech briefly stated: "Now that the military phase has ended, we are in a period of peaceful construction. Power and ability should be separated. Although the people have the right to demand that the government provide them with a secure and prosperous life, construction, safety guarantees, and equal diplomacy, they should also give the government the ability to build. After several committee members take office today, they should be able to demonstrate this ability. Premier Sun Yat-sen's vow was that one day he would travel by car to a certain place and arrive within a specified time, but the driver insisted on taking a small road. At first, Premier Sun Yat-sen was puzzled, but he was able to arrive on time in the end. This means that since authority is granted to the driver, the driver should make good use of his ability. Therefore, the people must give the government the authority to act. I am sure that the committee members will be able to abide by Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings and meet the needs of the people, achieving them in the shortest possible time."</p>
<p>Chairman Hu Hanmin's speech briefly stated: "Today is the day that Comrades Chiang, Zhang, and Yu take office. You have served the Party and the country for a long time, and I am confident that after taking office, you will be able to work even harder for the revolution and seek happiness for the people. The revolution has no retreat, only obligations and no rights. After taking office, you will be able to abide by Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings, work diligently, and strive with all your heart to demonstrate the spirit of working for the Party."</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, replied briefly: "I have just heard the speeches from Mr. Wu and Mr. Hu, and we will certainly act accordingly. In the oath, there are words about observing Premier Sun Yat-sen's teachings, enforcing the laws, and striving wholeheartedly in our duties. It is indeed most important for political progress to get on the right track. We will not waste a single penny or employ an incompetent person. Not only will we ourselves do this, but all departments, from the ministers down to the clerks, must work diligently and avoid engaging in private gain or corruption. We are determined to carry out the last four sentences of the oath to embody our spirit of service. Our Executive Yuan will certainly work hard to live up to the trust of the Central Government."</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang replied: "I am very moved by the speeches of the chairman and the oath-taker. In the future, I will do my best to be responsible, speaking frankly and exhaustively. I will implement the state's orders without exception and strive to do my best. In my duties, I will adhere to the Party's ideology and laws and act with a clear conscience. I also hope for the encouragement of my comrades."</p>
<p>Yu Youren replied: "I sincerely accept the speeches of the chairman and the oath-taker. I am very sorry that I was unable to accomplish many things in my previous duties. I have been ill for many years, which has delayed many tasks. Now that the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has resolved to appoint me as a member of the National Government, I will do my best to serve. As for the Control Yuan, it has not yet been established because it is a newly established organization and there needs to be a period of preparation. Furthermore, the Vice President is ill. Once the Vice President recovers, I will discuss matters with him and work hard to complete the work as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang replied: "The government recognizes pacification as necessary and has appointed me to this position. The responsibility is heavy, but it is also unavoidable. The people of Jiangsu are living in dire straits, even to the point of demolishing their homes to prevent bandits from using them as bases. Their suffering is evident. Now, during the period of political tutelage, we are gradually seeking construction. Without eliminating the Communist bandits, there is no way to build. Therefore, I can only do my best and hope that the members of the Central Committee, the Chairman of the National Government, and all comrades will provide guidance at any time. I will strive to eliminate the Communist bandits within the scheduled period to ensure the peace and prosperity of the people." After the speeches, music was played, photos were taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Central Party Headquarters and National Government Memorial Week <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>At 9 a.m. on November 24th, the Central Party Headquarters held a Premier Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week at the main hall of the Central Party Headquarters. Central Committee members Hu Hanmin, Wu Jingheng, Liu Luyin, Chen Lifu, Zhu Jiahua, Ma Chaojun, and others, as well as staff members from various departments and committees, and about six or seven hundred people in reality. Chairman Ma Chaojun conducted the ceremony, and then Wu Jingheng and Hu Hanmin gave reports, as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Jingheng's report briefly stated: The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to change the political report of each Memorial Week into a lecture, Premier Sun Yat-sen's will and work report. Today is the first implementation of this decision. In recent years, the Japanese have been very romantic and negligent, and have not been able to fully understand the profound origins of Premier Sun Yat-sen's will, so they can only try to express it to the comrades. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved to convene the National Assembly on May 5th next year. Originally, the National Assembly was what Premier Sun Yat-sen hoped to achieve in the shortest possible time, but the reason for the delay in its implementation was due to the continuous disruption and obstruction of warlords and reactionaries in politics. Now that the reactionary forces have been eliminated, it is natural to hold it in a timely manner. Previously, some people raised the issue of a provisional constitution, which is fundamentally untenable. This request can be divided into three types: (1) Externally, using this as a pretext for disruption; (2) Within the Party, those who do not understand the ideology and thus have erroneous concepts; (3) Nation-building.</p>

<p>The principles derived from the late leader's teachings are inherently numerous, while the demands are relatively few. The entirety of the late leader's teachings not only encompass all aspects of Chinese rule of law but also surpass the requirements of any constitutional nation in the world in terms of providing ample resources. If these teachings are genuinely implemented, there will be no concern about the lack of sufficient guarantees for the independence, freedom, and equality of the nation and its people. The late leader's testament begins by stating his dedication to the national revolution for forty years, with the goal of seeking China's freedom and equality. This implies that these two words, freedom and equality, are not merely a part of scholarly research but a unanimous demand of the four hundred million people of China. He further states that to achieve this goal, it is essential to awaken the masses and unite with nations worldwide that treat us with equality to strive together. This aims not only to inspire national unity for the collective pursuit of freedom and equality but also to work hand in hand with the world based on this principle to achieve universal harmony. Therefore, the word "essential" carries profound significance. He also states that the revolution has not yet succeeded, and all my comrades must continue to work diligently in accordance with the Fundamentals of National Reconstruction, the Outline of National Reconstruction, the Three Principles of the People, and the declaration of the First National Congress, as written by me, to achieve complete realization. This reflects the late leader's extraordinary clarity of mind during his final moments, fearing that his orphaned and isolated party members might lose their guidance and direction, and also fearing that doubts might arise among party members regarding his revolutionary speeches and established methods. Therefore, he presented these four treasures to the entire party and the nation to aid their progress. On one hand, he expressed earnest advice in his testament, and on the other hand, he implicitly suggested that anything not contradictory to these four treasures could be supplemented to achieve perfection. Hence, the word "must" is also of profound significance. Furthermore, the recent advocacy for convening a National Assembly and abolishing unequal treaties must be expedited within the shortest possible timeframe. The National Assembly represents the beginning of constructing a democratic nation, where the spirit of the entire nation is vested. The abolition of unequal treaties is the greatest guarantee of independence and freedom, and the sole direction for enhancing international standing. Therefore, the phrase "must especially" is added at the end to urge the party and the people to pay particular attention. These three "musts" effectively connect and amplify the overall effect. What other law could be more righteous and grand than what is revealed in the testament? The views discussed on this point at the Fourth Plenary Session are all similar, and this is specifically reported."</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin's report briefly stated: "The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session to change the Memorial Week report to a study of the late leader's teachings and party affairs work was made after detailed research and decision by the majority. The reasons have just been explained very clearly by Mr. Wu. What I am saying now is only a few points to supplement Mr. Wu's remarks. The meaning of the words 'Memorial Week' is to commemorate the late leader. To commemorate the late leader is to commemorate and implement the late leader's teachings at all times. In the past, the Memorial Week reports of various agencies mostly focused on politics, but mostly summarized or criticized the matters reported in the newspapers of the week. Often, the criticisms of various agencies on one matter differed, leading to inaccuracies and a lack of focus in the speeches, which had nothing to do with commemorating the late leader and implementing his principles. Therefore, the Fourth Plenary Session vigorously discussed and corrected this problem, and thus established two methods: (1) studying the late leader's teachings; (2) reporting on party affairs work. In this way, through repeated and meticulous instruction, not only can the late leader's teachings be greatly clarified, but also party affairs work can be improved and progressed daily. The Fourth Plenary Session can be said to have been attended by all, and all the proposals made were practical and not superficial. Although the meeting days were very short, the discussion time was very long. Every proposal was discussed at length, so all the decisions made were aimed at emphasizing the implementation of the late leader's creative principles, which are intended to benefit the country and the people and enable people to obtain practical benefits. Therefore, party affairs work must enable the general public to understand the principles and obtain benefits from the principles. Since the Third Plenary Session, the methods decided upon have been how to enable the general public to understand the principles, which is also the greatest work of the party. The late leader also said that individuals have no freedom, but the party has freedom. It is not that individuals have absolutely no freedom, but that individual freedom cannot be separated from the party, which is the so-called need to sacrifice the small self to achieve the greater self. The late leader's goal was to seek China's freedom and equality, and his spirit was extremely great. In the past, during the Xingzhonghui and Tongmenghui periods, party members sacrificed their property and lives to complete party affairs work. In the future, party members should continue this spirit, discuss and strive together, and not focus solely on material things, so that the party can improve day by day. The period of government under tutelage is only six years, and the constitutional government period will arrive in an instant. Party members must lead the people in implementing constitutional government. The first requirement of constitutional government is that everyone can govern themselves, understand the principles, and abide by the principles. If party members cannot govern themselves, the people will have no role models. Therefore, party members' work must first correct themselves before they can lead others. Only by understanding this meaning can they be said to understand party righteousness. The late leader attached great importance to propaganda. The late leader's so-called propaganda has a proper direction, which is to promote the principles into the minds of the general public so that everyone can obtain benefits from the principles. He explained this in great detail in his lectures on December 1 and 30 of the twelfth year. The late leader's propaganda was to promote the principles, not to promote individuals, so that everyone can obtain the propaganda of party righteousness, and everyone can understand the principles, so that the promotion of party affairs can be like a military mobilization, where a thousand promises are made in response to a single call, and the principles can be realized. Therefore, the late leader's testament earnestly urged us to awaken the masses and expedite their realization. The late leader clearly entrusted us with the responsibility of awakening the masses and expediting their realization. Therefore, our party work is to do the work of awakening the masses and expediting their realization. The phrase that party members cannot interfere in politics should not be misinterpreted. The party is a whole, and all politics come from the party. Party and politics are inseparable. If the party is separated from the party and politics from politics, this is a mistake. The so-called party members cannot interfere in politics is only a restriction on party members who do not understand party and politics and rashly interfere. It does not mean separating the party and politics into two. The party follows the late leader's principles, and the government also follows the late leader's principles. The two lead to the same destination and are mutually supportive, and the government and the party do not have independent natures. Fearing that people might misunderstand in the future, I will first clarify this point. Furthermore, I have mentioned the importance of propaganda, citing the late leader's words. However, in recent reality, there are still outrageous people who call Xuantong the emperor and write articles to foreign newspapers, wantonly criticizing the party. They believe this is freedom, but in the party, it is undisciplined. This is an attempt to take advantage of the weaknesses of young people, to deceive young people and sacrifice young people. It is hoped that the propaganda within the party will follow the late leader's proper direction and should alert young people to avoid being deceived and going astray." The ceremony concluded and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>The National Government held a Memorial Week for the late leader at 10:00 AM on the same day. Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Hanmin, Zhang Xueliang, Dai Jitao, Wang Chonghui, Wu Jingheng, Yu Youren, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Kong Xiangxi, Shao Yuanchong, Wang Boqun, Wang Zhengting, Ma Fuxiang, Zhu Jiahua, Yi Peiji, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Wei Daoming, He Yaozu, and hundreds of staff members from the National Government's Secretariat and the Office of the Military Council attended. After Chairman Chiang Kai-shek performed the ceremony, Hu Hanmin gave a work report, briefly stating: "The Fourth Plenary Session changed the political report in the Memorial Week for the late leader to a work report or a speech on party ideology. The State Council meeting last week asked me to report. Everyone working in the government should know that the late leader said that officials and students have no freedom, but organizations have freedom. Party members, students, and officials strive in the revolution not for their own freedom but for the freedom of the people. The Fourth Plenary Session has proposals to rejuvenate politics and rectify discipline, the main idea of which is to ensure that the work of various agencies is interconnected to avoid the previous looseness and lack of efficiency. Therefore, there are amendments to the Organic Law of the National Government to make politics easier to promote and more effective. Previously, every event had to go through many procedures and many twists and turns in official documents. Now, administrative matters are decided by the Executive Yuan, and all decrees and laws of the National Government can be promulgated by the Chairman, but they must be countersigned by relevant parties for simplicity. The people have many demands on the party, and we should work harder than before and can no longer use the influence of military affairs as an excuse. The late leader said that service is the purpose, and we should also engage in politics with this spirit. Great achievements come from law, and small achievements come from strictness. We must create a clean government and sacrifice some freedom. The so-called people have freedom, and officials have no freedom. The Fourth Plenary Session resolved to thoroughly inspect the party headquarters and strictly scrutinize party members, but it does not mean that all politics should be handled by party members. Political workers must also take responsibility and strive with the attitude of first blaming oneself and then blaming others. The Fourth Plenary Session has resolutions to rejuvenate politics and rectify discipline, hoping that government workers will take more responsibility and work harder." The report concluded and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Representatives from Both Sides Negotiate in Binyang</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The peaceful resolution of the Guangxi situation is still under consultation and coordination. Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, took this opportunity to return to Guangdong to arrange winter defenses and to visit Gu Yingfen. Chen departed from Wuzhou at 7:00 AM on the 19th aboard the Zhixin warship. Upon receiving the news, the provincial authorities immediately dispatched special cars and military police to the Hekou of Sanshui to welcome him. Another team of military police waited at the Shiwetang Station in Guangzhou, and the heads of various agencies also went to the station to greet him. At 3:30 PM, the Zhixin warship arrived at the Hekou of Sanshui, and Chen transferred to a Guangsan special train with an armored car in the lead. At 7:25 PM, he arrived at Shiwetang, then took a ferry across the river and returned to his private residence by car. That evening, officials from the headquarters held a welcome banquet at the Tuisi Garden in Dongshan, which ended joyfully at around 11:00 PM. During the banquet, Chen spoke briefly about the recent events in Guangxi, saying that the Zhang-Gui army had sent representatives to Wuzhou to negotiate surrender and requested that peaceful methods be used to resolve the Guangxi situation, which he sincerely supported. He added that he had no preconceived notions on this matter and that if the leaders of the Zhang-Gui army could sincerely repent and wholeheartedly support the Central Government in the future, there would be room for negotiation. Chen also stated that, as winter was approaching, he had taken the time to return to Guangdong to arrange winter defense matters. He had entrusted the military affairs in the front to Commander Yu Hanmou and the affairs in the rear to Councilor Miao Peinan and Commander Li Yangjing as acting commanders. According to news from the front, Chen had made proper arrangements for both peace and war during his return to Guangdong. If the peace talks fail, a general offensive order will be issued. As for the location of the peace negotiations, both sides agreed on Binyang. The Gui army will be represented by Wu Tingyang as the plenipotentiary, and the Zhang army will be represented by Huang Heling. The Eighth Route Army will be represented by Miao Peinan. The representatives from both sides will negotiate for no more than one month. As for the Gui army's side, Huang Shaoxiong is coming forward to mediate. Huang recently sent a representative to Wuzhou to meet with Chen Jitang. The Gui side's opinion is that Huang Shaoxiong should resolve the Guangxi situation in the future and grant Huang the title of Guangxi Post-War Governor to facilitate the incorporation of Li Bai's troops. When Huang's representative met with Chen in Wuzhou, he sent a secret telegram from Huang to Gu Yingfen, which read: "Secretly forward to Gu Xiangweng for your perusal. The Guangxi province has suffered greatly from years of war, and the people and soldiers are eager for peace. If the Central Government shows leniency and sends a suitable official to take charge of the resolution, those who are fearful can be reassured, and those who are stubborn will not be able to resist. Shaoxiong has been waiting at the frontier for a long time and has not been involved in affairs. He has always had deep respect for you and for Guangdong and Guangxi. I dare to dedicate my foolish sincerity and earnestly beg for your strong mediation to resolve the peace, which will be very easy. Shaoxiong will be listed among the good citizens under your rule, which is also your gift to me. Huang Shaoxiong kowtows, Yang" (November 19).</p>

<p>Jinan Correspondence: The diplomatic corps, consisting of 19 individuals including ambassadors, chargés d'affaires, and counselors from nine countries who participated in the celebration of the capital's promotion to peace, passed through Jinan on the 15th of this month on their way to Beijing.

<h3 id="e72">Jinan City Levies House Tax <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The house tax in this city was first levied by Zhang Zongchang in the autumn of the 14th year of the Republic (1925). It was levied again in the spring of the 17th year of the Republic (1928). After the provincial government moved to Jinan last year, it was decided at a regular meeting to implement the levy of house tax in this fiscal year, which will be handled by the Jinan Municipal Government and has been included in the budget for the 19th year of the Republic (1930). There are two categories: residential house tax and commercial house tax. Residential house tax refers to ordinary people's housing and is levied at 5% of the rental value. At that time, it was estimated that 10,000 households would pay 75 cents each, generating a monthly revenue of $7,500. 20,000 households would pay 30 cents each, generating a monthly revenue of $6,000. The total annual revenue would be $162,000. Commercial house tax refers to businesses and is levied at 10% of the rental value. It is estimated that 5,000 households would pay an average of $2 per month each, generating a total revenue of $10,000 per month. The total annual revenue would be $120,000. Combining both residential and commercial house taxes, the total annual revenue would be $282,000. Subsequently, the case was shelved due to the entry of the Jin army into Jinan and the relocation of the provincial government to Qingdao. Recently, the provincial government revived the old case and repeatedly urged the municipal government to expedite the matter. Mayor Chen Weixin believed that the municipal government's expenses were strained, and the budget was a concern that could not be ignored. Therefore, he ordered the Finance Bureau to actively prepare. As of now, the procedures for levying the tax and the organization of the preparatory office have been determined as follows: (1) The tax rate for residential house tax will still be 5% of the rental value, to be paid by the landlord. The tax rate for commercial house tax will be 10%, to be shared equally between the tenant and the landlord. Poor tenants with a monthly rent of less than $5 will be exempt from the tax to show compassion. Government and school buildings, if they are government property, will be exempt from the tax. If they are rented, the landlord will still be required to pay the house tax. (2) The method of collection will be that the landlord will be responsible for the residential house tax. However, to prevent landlords from raising rents, the municipal government will first cooperate with the party headquarters to organize an evaluation committee to investigate the current rental prices in the city and establish fair regulations. The Finance Bureau will issue a separate rent certificate to the landlord, who will then pay the tax according to the rental price on the rent certificate and will not be allowed to increase the price arbitrarily. The original rent book will be cancelled, and a fee of 10 cents will be charged for the rent certificate. For those who own and live in their own houses, the landlord will estimate the rental value himself and pay the tax according to the regulations. If the estimated rental value is too low, the Finance Bureau may revise it. (3) The organization of the preparatory office. The detailed rules for the organization of the house tax preparatory office have been approved by the municipal government meeting. It will have one director, three clerks in charge of general affairs, accounting, and document affairs, and twelve investigators. (4) The date of commencement of the levy. The preparatory office is expected to complete the investigation by the end of this year and start levying the tax on January 1 of next year. According to Mayor Chen Weixin, the house tax rate in this city is lighter than in other cities in the country. If $200,000 can be collected each year, the municipal expenses can be covered (22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e73">The Story of Zhang Zongchang's Imminent Return to China <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Northeast Pities His Poverty and Requests Exemption from Arrest Warrants and the Return of Confiscated Property</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The rumor that Zhang Zongchang will be reinstated in the Northeast has been spreading recently. Furthermore, figures formerly associated with Zhang Zongchang, such as Lin Xianzhu, the former governor of Shandong, and Cheng Guorui, the former commander of the Third Army, have been actively engaging in activities in Shenyang, attracting the attention of various parties. Given the extremely significant implications of this matter for the current situation, inquiries were made with various relevant parties, revealing that it is far from the truth. Commander Zhang Xueliang, in light of the national disasters and the many disadvantages suffered by the Northeast over the past decade, deeply loathes evil warlords of Zhang Zongchang's ilk. Moreover, during the Feng army's entry into the customs in the 17th year of the Republic (1928), Zhang Zongchang even turned against them. Given his intentions, the Northeast would absolutely not accommodate him. The reason for telegraphing the central government to revoke his arrest warrant and return the previously confiscated property, such as the real estate in Shilaoniang Hutong and Shizi Hutong in Peiping, as well as in Yushu Hutong and various commercial districts in Shenyang, is that after Zhang Zongchang's defeat in Shandong, he has been eking out a precarious existence in the eastern region for years, spending as much as ten million dollars. With his funds depleted and supplies exhausted, Zhang had long sought to return to China during the Central Plains War but was denied permission by various parties, leaving Zhang in a difficult position. He then sent a representative to Zhang Xueliang to plead for permission to take refuge in the Northeast. Zhang, remembering that Zhang Zongchang had followed Zhang Zuolin for many years, felt some sympathy and generously granted his request, simultaneously making representations to the National Government to revoke the arrest warrant and allowing him to return to China and reside temporarily in the Northeast. It is believed that Zhang Zongchang will soon return from Japan. However, the rumors of reinstating Zhang and giving him a position are not true and are merely the baseless claims of Zhang's former subordinates (20th).</p>
<h3 id="e74">Liaoning Legal Entities Discuss Issuing Prize-Winning Bonds <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>To Relieve Financial Panic and Aid Commerce and Agriculture</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: The Liaoning General Chamber of Commerce, Provincial Education Association, Agricultural Association, and Youth Association, legal entities, believe that the province's finances have been exceptionally tight in recent years. Not only have large and small businesses inside and outside the province been collapsing one after another, but farmers in various regions have also reached the point where their finances cannot be sustained. Although the new grain crop has arrived, the price of grain has fallen sharply due to the stagnation of finances, and merchants and farmers are in extreme difficulty. According to someone from Jinxi County, the number of deaths due to debt in the county has recently reached more than 40 in a single month. The main reason is that those in debt cannot fulfill their obligations, and creditors sue in court. Even if the court rules in accordance with the law, they are still unable to enforce the judgment, so the judgment is tantamount to being ineffective. Therefore, no one in the private sector is filing lawsuits in court regarding debt disputes, and many are resorting to force, resulting in a series of deaths and creating the most tragic social phenomenon. As for the police and school institutions in various counties, the financial difficulties in the western Liaoning counties due to the floods are self-evident. Even in the counties with the best harvests, there is currently extreme panic, resulting in police and school salaries being paid partially or being in arrears for three to four months. If this continues, the situation in the various counties will become even more unbearable. Therefore, at 2:00 PM on the 19th, leading figures from various associations held a joint discussion meeting at the Education Association to discuss relief measures and invited Lu Muting, the Director of the Dongsan Province Official Silver Bank, to join the discussion. As a result of the discussion, it was generally agreed that the aforementioned financial difficulties in various counties were purely due to the insufficient distribution of currency circulating throughout the province. According to a recent survey, the currency currently circulating in the province includes 15 million yuan of hard currency issued by the Bianye, China, Jiaotong, and Official Silver Banks' preparation warehouses, and 20 million yuan of Bianye Bank banknotes valued at 14 million yuan in Feng Dayang (the current Feng banknotes have been destroyed many times, leaving only 70 million, valued at 60 yuan as 1 yuan of hard currency, totaling 14 million yuan in hard currency). The Official Silver Bank's newly discovered hard currency notes are less than 5 million yuan, and the China and Jiaotong Commercial Banks' banknotes total approximately 5 million yuan. Combined with the 12 million yuan of hard currency raised by the mint, the total circulating throughout the province is only 70 million yuan in hard currency and banknotes. The province's population has now increased to more than 13 million, and prices are high (except for grain prices), far exceeding those of the past. The need for goods and mediums of exchange (currency) should naturally increase accordingly. However, the Official Silver Bank has always been extremely cautious about issuing more banknotes, fearing that it would affect its credit. Although there have been proposals to allow the various counties to issue commercial stickers or circulating notes, it is ultimately felt that there are many drawbacks and they are hesitant to try it lightly. Therefore, after a full vote, it was decided to suggest to the authorities that several tens of millions of yuan of prize-winning bonds be issued to provide farmers and merchants with capital for turnover, to be fully redeemed in two years, with interest paid every six months. In order to strengthen credit, it was decided to invite the Liaoning Banking Group and the leaders of various legal entities to join in order to show openness. It was generally agreed to elect Lu Muting, the Director of the Dongsan Province Official Silver Bank, and Jin Enqi, the President of the General Chamber of Commerce, to represent them in meeting with Zang Shiyi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, to explain everything in detail and request approval for implementation (20th).</p>

School board member Wang also gave a speech, saying that the words "yao" (important), "hao" (good), and "an" (safe) all come from the character "nu" (woman), which shows that to be important, good, and safe all depends on women. Therefore, if people want harmony and peace, it all depends on the efforts of women.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Liu Zhanen and Others Will Issue a Statement Asking the Municipal Council to Investigate Schools <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Investigation Is Based on a Letter from the Chinese Ratepayers Association</p>
<p>丨Ministry of Education Translation Name Will Change丨</p>
<p>Guo Wen She reported that the Shanghai Concession Municipal Council recently issued a letter to investigate schools in the concession in the name of the Education Department. People in this city have repeatedly expressed opposition to this move in newspapers. It has been found that the motivation of the Municipal Council for this move was based on a clause in a letter from the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai Concession on March 26th of the 17th year of the Republic of China ("Under the current situation, the responsibility of expanding Chinese education in the concession should be emphasized"). Therefore, the Education Committee of the Design Agency was organized this year. The committee name is Ｂｏａｒｄ　ｏｆ　Ｅｄｕｏａｔｉｏｎ, with three Chinese members, namely Liu Zhanen and others, as well as four Westerners and one Japanese. Mr. Liu believes that under the current situation, there are too many students who drop out of school in the concession, and it is imperative to promote education so that Chinese education in the concession gradually becomes consistent with national education. However, to promote education, it is necessary to first clarify the current situation of education in the concession before there is a basis. This is the origin of the publication of the investigation. As for the Municipal Council issuing a letter to investigate in the name of the Education Department, it was not a resolution of the Education Committee, nor was it something that other gentlemen had ever heard of. Because the Municipal Council originally had an Education Department (Ｅｄｕｃａｔｉｏｎ　Ｄｅｔａｒｌｍｅｎｔ), those who translated it into Chinese used the word "Department" because the Chinese names of the Municipal Council's police, health, and other agencies all used the word "Department", so it was translated as "Department". After this matter was discovered, Mr. Liu and others thought it was inappropriate and proposed to change it. It will soon be changed. Mr. Liu and others will also issue an advertisement to answer all sectors of the community concerned about education in the concession.</p>
<h3 id="e93">County Education Bureau Meeting Minutes <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Education Bureau held its 176th bureau meeting yesterday after the weekly memorial service. Attendees included Bureau Chief Shi, Zheng Guoqi, Sun Tingfang, Lin Weiwen, Niu Zhiyi, Yang Huiming, Yan Chongguang, Yao Jue, Xi Siwu, Cai Xingsan, Zhu Xixue, Wu Renyuan, and Pan Xingsan. Bureau Chief Shi presided, and Pan Xingsan served as recorder. The meeting followed established protocol. Matters reported were omitted. Discussion items: (1) Regarding the proposal from the Second District Office to appoint nearby village chiefs as school property custodians for village primary schools, a matter that had already been approved in principle by the bureau-district conference, the discussion focused on determining the title and regulations for implementation. The resolution was to note that, according to the Law on Village Autonomy, the village chief already has the responsibility to handle education and other cultural matters, and therefore, there was no need to establish a separate title. The intention of the original proposal was largely commendable, and it was resolved to have Education Commissioners Lin and Niu draft implementation regulations for further discussion at a future meeting. (2) Regarding the issue of the Municipal Land Bureau issuing a topographical map of the county temple property to the bureau, showing a shortage of approximately three acres compared to the original records, the resolution was to send a letter to the Municipal Land Bureau inquiring about the following points: A. How much land was taken for road construction? B. How much was deducted for the Lake Heart Pavilion and the river? And what other reasons were there for the discrepancy? (3) Regarding the school equipment survey forms that had been reviewed and revised, a discussion was held. The resolution was to approve the forms and instruct that they be distributed to the schools for completion. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Results of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Football Tournament: Shanghai College Wins the Championship <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Defeated Jinling Yesterday with a Score of Four to One</p>
<p>Huilan and Jinling Tie for Second Place</p>
<p>The final match of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Private Middle School Athletic Association's football championship was held in Yangshupu for several days. Shanghai College and Jinling College reached the final and competed for the championship at 10:00 AM yesterday. Shanghai College defeated Jinling with a score of four to one, and Shanghai College won the championship. The consolation final was also held at 10:00 AM yesterday, with Huilan defeating Soochow University with a score of three to zero. Huilan and Jinling were originally scheduled to play for second place tomorrow, but because both teams had to return to their schools last night, the match was moved to 3:00 PM yesterday, resulting in a 1-1 tie, and both teams shared the second-place position. Hu Minmin was the referee for the game. A brief account of the championship match is given below.</p>
<p>Both Shanghai College and Jinling College had many talented players, and each victory was hard-won. In the final, both teams were determined to seize the championship, so the battle was fierce. Shanghai College's unity and coordination were effective. Center forward Dai Linzhen had the spirit of his elder brother Linjing, lively and strong, and scored the first goal. Jinling tried to advance and exact revenge. The goal of Shanghai College was heavily guarded. Shanghai College committed two penalty kicks within twenty yards, but Jinling only scored on one of them, resulting in a 1-1 tie at halftime.</p>
<p>In the second half, Shanghai College's discipline was strict, and their attacks were even more aggressive. Although Jinling tried its best to resist, they suffered from fatigue. There were many opportunities to attack, but Shanghai College's comprehensive defense left no chance. Shanghai College launched a large-scale offensive. The defense was tight, and the forwards scored with all their might. Li Ruchun, Jing Yong, and Lin Guanghua all scored goals, achieving a resounding victory of four to one. Xu Zhendong was the referee. The lineups of both teams were as follows:</p>

<p>Last Night's YMCA Basketball Game: Chung Hua Loses Unluckily</p>
<h3 id="e99">Defeated by Pirates Twenty to Twenty-Two <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Three games were played in the YMCA basketball league last night. In the first game, Chung Hua's loss to the YMCA Pirates was unfortunate. In the last minute, when the two teams were fighting for the ball, a whistle was suddenly heard, and the ball fell into the basket. Everyone thought it was a successful basket, but the referee indicated that the basket was scored before the time, which was inexplicable. At that moment, the final whistle blew, and Chung Hua lost in this unfortunate decision. In the other two games: (1) Rowing defeated Jews with a score of 48 to 14, with Hans as the referee in the first half of the game (2) Public defeated Shizhong with a score of 37 to 22, with Brett as the referee in the first half of the game. Shizhong showed a great resurgence in the second half, but the gap in the first half was too large, and they were unable to catch up. Tonight there will be two games, one in group A and one in group B, starting at 7:45 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e100">A Fierce Battle Between Chung Hua and Pirates <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Chung Hua's inside guards, Liao Lie and Guan Yi, were skilled and good at defense, and Liao Lie's skills were particularly outstanding. With these two generals, Chung Hua's defense was as solid as a city wall. The three forwards, Chen Baoqiu, He Yanzhang, and Wei Zuohan, also cooperated well. Last night, when they played against the YMCA Pirates, He Yanzhang was absent due to illness, and the team's fighting power was greatly reduced. Otherwise, how could the Pirates have been able to compete with them? Chung Hua's Liao Lie scored three points with a single shot, opening the scoring for the two teams. The Pirates attacked three times but failed to score. The Pirates' right forward, Tou Ren, dribbled and scored four free throws. Chung Hua's Chen Baoqiu directly intercepted and put the ball into the basket, followed by a free throw, giving them a 6-4 lead. Tou Ren then scored another free throw, leaving the two teams separated by one point. Under the supervision of Liao and Guan, the Pirates could not move freely and paused the game to discuss countermeasures and continue fighting. The Pirates' formation was indeed good, but their shooting was poor, and they only scored one goal in several throws. However, Chen soon caught up, and the two teams fought fiercely. The first half ended in a 9-9 tie. In the second half, Tafel threw the ball into the basket under the basket. Chung Hua's Yan Furui also scored from the crowd. The Pirates then relied on Tou Ren's strength to add three points. Chung Hua's inside guards Liao and Guan participated in the attack one after another, and Yan also scored one point, putting Chung Hua ahead with 17 to 14. The Pirates, unable to score with close shots, tried long-range shots. With the blessing of the gods, Pike and Tou Ren both succeeded. In the last four minutes, Zhu Kaiming replaced Yan and scored a free throw as soon as he entered the field, tying the score at 18. Then, Liao of Chung Hua and Lao of Pirates each scored a long-range shot, making the score 20. At this critical moment, the referee acted arbitrarily. Pirates relied on Pike's goal to win by luck with a score of 22 to 20. The referee was Bates.</p>

<p>This newspaper reports the results of Group A teams in the Western Football League every weekend. Many Chinese teams have joined Groups B and C, so we are listing them separately below to provide a general overview of the Chinese teams and the situation of each team.</p>
<p>Group B: There are a total of seventeen teams. Only two universities, John's and Shanghai College, have joined as Chinese teams. Their strength is barely satisfactory. Lax is currently in first place with five wins in five games. Jewish has also won four in four games. Other teams, such as Howarth and Wah Seas, are also very strong. It is impossible to predict the changes when strong enemies meet in the future.</p>

<p>Group C: There are a total of eighteen teams. The Chinese teams challenging in this group are Hua Ling, Dan, and Starlight. The Bata team has won four consecutive games and is competing with the French Army and the Italian Navy for the ranks of the winning team. Hua Ling has also won four wins, one draw in five games, leading the vanguard. Dan is also considered not weak, and Starlight is slightly inferior. The French Army is currently in the top position, with Hua Ling trailing by one point, and Bata is in third place with one fewer game played. The future is promising.

When the special train arrived at the station, the sound of the whistle could be heard from afar. Those welcoming them stood smiling and waiting for the special train to enter the platform. At 6:40 AM, with the wheels rolling, music played on the platform and the crowd surged forward. Many people in military uniforms leaned out of the train windows and nodded to the welcomers. After the train stopped, the welcomers went on board PC Train No. 14 to greet Madam Zhang briefly. Madam Zhang then gracefully descended from the train. A photographer from this newspaper immediately took her picture</p>

<p>To Commemorate the Occasion, Madam Zhang was wearing a sky-blue cheongsam with a black overcoat with a fur collar. Her demeanor was calm and her face was cheerful. Madam Yu seemed to enjoy the scenery of the Jiangnan region.</p>
<p>People Who Arrived Together: In addition to Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Xueming, those who accompanied Madam Yu Fengzhi included the Mayor of Qingdao, Hu Ruoyu, the Director of the Tianjin Second Special District, Ning Xiangnan, the Deputy Director of the Sipingtaonan Railway Bureau, Mr. and Mrs. Wu Jingan, the Secretary and Madam Shen Zutong, the British advisor to the Northeast Commander, Mr. Yagg, the President of the Tianjin Court, Du Zexian, the Secretary Zhao Yunpu, the Medical Officer Wu Xiaolou, the Adjutants Wang, Zhang, and Zhao, and sixteen staff members. Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, Madam Sun Ke, and Madam Kong Xiangxi also accompanied the train to Shanghai. Those welcoming them at the station included Wu Tiecheng, Chen Diaoyuan and Madam Chen, Sheng Enyi and Madam Sheng, Qian Jichen, Mr. and Mrs. Shen Nengyi, Liu Yunfang, Commander Xiong, Chief of Staff Xu Jinyuan on behalf of the commander, Secretary Yu on behalf of Mayor Zhang, the police band of the Garrison Headquarters and the Municipal Public Security Bureau all arrived at the station to play music to welcome them. Soldiers, police, and detectives were at the station providing tight security.</p>
<p>Breakfast at Rongpu: After getting off the train, Madam Yu Fengzhi and Mr. and Mrs. Zhang Xueming drove to Chen's Rongpu at 243 Haig Road to rest. Madam Yu was in Chen Diaoyuan's No. 797 sedan car. The cars that followed numbered over twenty, snaking along the road. The cars arrived at Rongpu around 7:00 AM. The Zhangs went inside to rest, while Zhang Xueming met with guests in the main hall. Mr. Zhang's face was fuller than Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang's. He was wearing a gray-brown robe with a black mandarin jacket and a black short outer jacket. Judging from his remarks, he was very optimistic.</p>

<p>The small photo included is the one taken in the main hall of Rongpu. The rest of the entourage stayed at the Cangzhou Hotel.</p>
<p>Yu Fengzhi's Remarks: After Madam Yu Fengzhi and her party arrived at Rongpu, a reporter from this newspaper also drove there to pay a visit. We were granted an audience. Madam Zhang said that she had two missions for her trip to Shanghai: (1) Deputy Commander originally planned to take the time to visit Shanghai and Hangzhou during this trip south. Now, because matters in Beijing had not been completed and he was eager to return north, the trip to Shanghai and Hangzhou was cancelled. I am here to thank everyone on behalf of the Deputy Commander for their warm welcome. (2) In the past, I was in charge of fundraising for the disaster relief in western Liaoning. I am grateful to all sectors of Shanghai for their generous support and the huge amount of funds raised, which greatly benefited the disaster victims. Therefore, I came to Shanghai to thank all sectors on behalf of the disaster victims. I also visited the Women's Association and the Women's Political and Legal College in Beijing and found the various facilities to be excellent models. I will make efforts to promote women's education in the future when I return to Liaoning to ensure that men and women are equal in learning and ability.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueming's Remarks: The reporter then met with Zhang Xueming. Reporter: What is your impression of this trip south? Zhang: The capital is full of vitality, everything is being renewed, and the future of the country is promising. However, I am engaged in police affairs, so I paid a lot of attention to police affairs in Beijing. The police facilities in the capital are very energetic, and the police officers are also lively, loyal, and diligent, which is commendable. However, the streets of Nanjing are too narrow, and it seems dangerous and difficult to rescue in case of a fire. Also, most of the ditches in Beijing are clogged, and there are too many ponds everywhere, which seems to be a bit lacking in terms of hygiene. Now it is planned to gradually improve, and the municipal administration will definitely be remarkable in the future. Reporter: What are your plans after arriving in Shanghai? Zhang: I plan to examine the police administration in the foreign concessions to learn from it. I heard that the police facilities in Hangzhou are very good, and I would like to go there for reference. Reporter: Will you return north by sea or by land? Zhang: The Deputy Commander will stay in Beijing for a few more days, but we must rush back to the capital before Friday of this week (the 28th) to accompany the Deputy Commander back north by train.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Activities: Around 9:00 AM yesterday, Mayor Zhang and his wife made a special trip to Rongpu to visit Madam Zhang and take care of everything. They had a very pleasant conversation. Then, they were invited to lunch at the Cangzhou Hotel. In the afternoon, they toured various places with Madam Zhang Qun and others. At 7:00 PM, Mr. and Mrs. Sun Ke and Chen Mingshu sent invitations to a banquet at the Xinghualou Restaurant to welcome more than 100 guests from all walks of life. After the banquet, Mr. and Mrs. Shen Nengyi accompanied Madam Zhang on a tour of the city.</p>
<p>Tonight's Grand Banquet: Madam Soong Mei-ling, wife of Chairman Chiang, originally intended to come with Madam Zhang, but she was unable to do so due to events, so she asked her sister, Madam Kong Xiangxi, Soong Ai-ling, to represent her. Mr. and Mrs. Kong Xiangxi will hold a banquet at their private residence today to welcome the Songhu Garrison Commander Xiong Shihui and Mr. and Mrs. Zhang. They will host a grand banquet at the Dahua Hotel at 8:00 PM to welcome more than 100 people, including Madam Tang Shaoyi, Madam Wellington Koo, and celebrities from all walks of life. After the banquet, there will be tea and dancing. The scene will be grand and lively.</p>
<p>Decision to Cancel the Hangzhou Tour: Madam Zhang, Zhang Xueming, and their party originally planned to take the opportunity to visit Hangzhou and see the sights of the Three Pagodas and Six Bridges. However, due to the limited time and the need to return to Beijing before Friday of this week (the 28th) to accompany Deputy Commander Zhang to the north, the tour of Hangzhou was canceled after detailed discussions last night between Madam Zhang and her aides.</p>
<p>Returning to Beijing Soon: This is Madam Zhang's first time in Shanghai, and she is very willing to do some sightseeing. However, according to news from this newspaper last night, there were plans to return to Beijing tonight, but various sectors have pleaded to stay. The itinerary may be delayed for a day or two. It is said that the facilities at Rongpu, where they are staying, are not very good. Today they may move to the Cathay Hotel on the Bund or the Sheng Residence on Jing'an Temple Road. When they return to Beijing, their entourage and Gao Jiyi, Chairman of the Northeast Transportation Committee and Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, who came to Shanghai earlier, and Zhang Zuoxiang's son, Zhang Yujiu, will all travel with them in the same train as Deputy Commander Zhang to the north.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Internal and External Debt Consolidation Meeting <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Meeting held in Shanghai today</p>
<p>Minister Song and others arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Meeting focuses on discussions without ceremony</p>
<p>Representatives of Tianjin and Pingjin Banks arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>The National Government's Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee has held several meetings in Nanjing and announced the outline for consolidating foreign debt. It is now scheduled to continue the consolidation meeting in Shanghai starting today (25th), first discussing the plan for consolidating internal debt. Representatives of the Tianjin and Pingjin banking community's creditor group, including Zhou Zuomin, Tan Danya, Wang Zemin, and Zhu Yusheng, have successively arrived in Shanghai to report to the Ministry of Finance's office and handle meeting procedures. It is determined that representatives from the Shanghai banking community, including Zhang Gongquan, Ye Fuxiao, Hu Mengjia, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Zheqing, and Li Ming, will attend the meeting today. Many consolidation plans have been proposed in recent days. The National Government has also prepared to establish a fund and concrete consolidation policies, so the prices of various internal debts in the market have risen one after another. However, although today's meeting is held in the Ministry of Finance's office, it is said that because the meeting is of a discussion nature, there will be no ceremony, and news of the meeting will be kept secret for the time being to avoid affecting the market.</p>
<p>Another report states that the National Government's Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee, presided over by Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, has held several meetings in Nanjing. It is now scheduled to continue the meeting in Shanghai today. Minister Song intends to attend in person, so he came to Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. Zeng Rongfu, Secretary-General of the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee, also came with him and has been very busy preparing for the meeting in recent days. He will also attend the meeting today. Li Sihao, the newly appointed Chairman of the Internal and External Debt Consolidation Committee, also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing last night and is scheduled to attend the meeting today and take office. It is said that Minister Song has been separately negotiating with ministers and chargés d'affaires of various countries on foreign debt consolidation methods and meeting dates in recent days.</p>

<p>Results of the Bankers Association meeting yesterday</p>
<p>Ten members nominated as initiators</p>
<p>Six representatives dispatched from Peiping by telegram to participate</p>
<p>Representatives from Pingjin arrive in Shanghai to establish group</p>
<p>The Shanghai banking community will discuss the consolidation of China's internal debt. After the banking sector's creditor group is established, a joint national registration of internal debt creditors will be held. The Shanghai Bankers Association convened a general membership meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at the Bankers Association at No. 4 Hong Kong Road for this matter. More than 20 managers from various banks attended. As a result of the discussion, ten members were nominated in Shanghai as initiators of the Chinese internal debt banking sector creditor group. The elected members include Li Fusun, Chairman of the Bank of China; Hu Mengjia, General Manager of the Bank of Communications; Wu Yunzhai, Manager of the Jin Cheng Bank; Ye Fuxiao, Manager of the Continental Bank; Chen Zheqing, Manager of the Y盐业 Bank; Hu Bijiang, Manager of the Zhongnan Bank; Sun Hengfu, Manager of the Siming Bank; Wang Xinguang, Manager of the Hongkou Commercial Bank; Chang Xiaobo, Manager of the Juxingcheng Bank; and Liu Huizhi of the China Industrial Bank. The Peiping Bankers Association sent a telegram yesterday nominating Zhang Gongquan, General Manager of the Bank of China; Lu Jianquan, Chairman of the Bank of Communications; Tan Danya, General Manager of the Continental Bank; Zhou Zuomin, Manager of the Jin Cheng Bank; Zhu Yusheng, Manager of the Peiping Y盐业 Bank; and Wang Zemin, Manager of the Peiping Baoshang Bank, as representatives to participate in the initiation. Except for Zhu Yusheng and Wang Zemin, who will arrive in Shanghai from Peiping within a few days, the other representatives are all in Shanghai, which is very convenient for consultation. However, the Tianjin Bankers Association had not yet replied by telegram as of last night, so a telegram has been sent again to inquire. It is expected that representatives will also come to Shanghai to participate within a few days. It is estimated that the various initiators in Shanghai will formally establish the internal debt creditor group as soon as the Pingjin representatives arrive to discuss the specific issues of internal debt consolidation. Then, all national creditors will register in full, and then a number of representatives will be re-elected from the creditor group to go to Nanjing to contact the Ministry of Finance and start the consolidation process.</p>
<h3 id="e121">After the End of Military Transportation, Jianghai Hualun Resumes Service <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>All routes will return to normal on the first of next month</p>
<p>Recent allocation of shipping is extremely busy</p>
<p>Due to the continuous domestic wars in the past two years, Jianghai Hualun has suspended service. This year, the Transportation Department rented as many as 70 merchant ships at its peak, allowing foreign ships to take the opportunity to become active. Domestic shipping companies have lost tens of millions in the transportation industry. By the end of September this year, the military operations ended, and many ships were returned. In October, in order to suppress the Communist bandits in Xiangjiang and Jiangxi, the military moved troops to the Yangtze River basin, and the Lu and Chen divisions changed their defenses to Anhui, so another 18 ships were rented for transportation. Now, the troops suppressing the bandits have reached their destination, and all the rented ships have been returned to Shanghai. The Jianghai ships, which had been suspended for a long time, have now fully resumed service. From December 1st, all Chinese merchant ships on the northern and southern oceans and the Yangtze River can resume their regular schedules. This is not only a turning point for the continuation of the shipping industry, but also an opportunity for the revival of national shipping. The various companies have been very busy planning the restoration and allocating routes in recent days, which is worth recording.</p>
<p>All Sea Vessels Return to Shanghai　Since the release of the Gongping, Xinchang, and Tangshan ships last week, only the Huayang and Tunan ships have not been released. Yesterday, when the China Merchants Bureau was preparing to report the charter fees for October and November, it telegraphed Nanjing to request the release of these two ships as soon as possible, as December 1st is the first day for the full resumption of regular schedules for national ships. It is heard that the Transportation Department has agreed to release the two sea vessels to Shanghai this month as a result of the charter procedures.</p>
<p>Four River Vessels to Return Immediately　At its peak, more than 20 Yangtze River ships were rented. Now, in addition to those that have been released, only the Jiangtian, Dexing, Fulong, Fengpu, and Xingshi ships remain. After repeated requests from Sanbei China Merchants to release the ships, they can return to Shanghai by the end of the month at the latest. Within the Yangtze River line, the Hualun ships have usually operated no more than six ships since last year, and they have been suspended and reopened from time to time. Now that the war has stopped and the ships have been released, and the navy is escorting them along the river, the China Merchants Bureau's Yangtze River ships can resume eight ships on the upper river, Sanbei can operate five ships on the upper river, and Ning Shao Zhaoxing can operate three ships, restoring the number of schedules before the war. The competition for cargo among the various companies has been very intense in recent days.</p>
<p>Beiyang to Resume Regular Schedules Immediately　The Beiyang regular schedule has been suspended for a long time. Now, although the China Merchants Bureau's Xinming has opened, the Xinfeng was hit by the Japanese ship Kageyama Maru and came to Shanghai for major repairs. Yesterday, it was confirmed that the losses for both goods and hull amounted to 40,000 yuan, and a claim has been filed with the Japanese Post Office and the Near Seas Association. The bureau plans to dispatch the Beiyang ships (1) Tianjin regular schedule: three ships: Xinfeng, Xinming, and Yushun (2) Dalian schedule: Tunan or Huayang (3) Haizhou schedule: Tonghua. The Nanhua ship is also scheduled to resume regular schedules on the 1st.</p>
<p>A List of All Ships Suspended from Service　From last year to the present, the length of time and the number of ships provided to the central government for rent are truly astonishing. The daily rental for each ship ranged from 300 yuan to 100 yuan. The rental fees for the past two years must have been several million yuan. The military transportation has ended, and the rental fees are being settled. The China Merchants Bureau alone has a considerable record of the dates of suspension of the various ships. The number of days of military transportation last year and the number of days of suspension as of September this year are recorded below, which can also give a glimpse of the situation.</p>
<p>(Ship Name) Last Year This Year (Ship Name) Last Year This Year (Ship Name) Last Year This Year</p>

<p>At the Memorial Ceremony of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce held a memorial week for the Premier in the auditorium yesterday morning. More than 100 members of the entire staff and representatives from various industries attended. Executive Committee Member Lao Jingxiu presided over the ceremony. Then, Wang Yansong, a standing committee member of the chamber, reported on the relationship between the Fourth Plenary Session and industry and commerce. A record of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Representatives, the most important event this week is of course the complete success of the Fourth Plenary Session. I think the success of the Fourth Plenary Session is not only an important event this week or even this year, but it occupies an extremely important page in the history of the success of the Chinese revolution, because this is a new era of construction that began after the elimination of the remaining warlords. There have been concrete resolutions and specific regulations in terms of party affairs, politics, and economy, and extremely serious corrections have been made to previous errors. I think that the spirit of great justice and sincerity of the Central Committee members can really arouse the unanimous admiration and support of the people of the whole country. With this sincere spirit, after the closing of the Plenary Session, all the resolutions will surely be implemented step by step. It will not be like the problem of "meeting but not passing, passing but not acting, and acting but not getting through" that President Hu said in his opening speech at the Fourth Plenary Session. The Fourth Plenary Session also had a very important and very close resolution on commerce, which is to revitalize industry and implement the abolition of likin from January 1, 1931. I think we have heard a lot of the voice of cutting likin in the Chamber of Commerce, and we are very annoyed by it. After the establishment of the National Government, it also convened meetings to discuss methods, issued orders, and stipulated dates, but in fact it was not able to effectively do it. Although the consumption tax to compensate for likin has been implemented for a long time, likin is still being collected there. We want to ask why the government cannot do the cutting of likin. The first major obstacle is really the division of the remaining warlords. On the one hand, these warlords expanded their private territories, recruited soldiers, and added generals to buy guns and cannons, but these guns, cannons, soldiers, and generals could not do without money. Therefore, the financial unification of the central government could not be carried out. In the several provinces they divided, they still had to collect likin, or even collect particularly heavy taxes. In this way, naturally, the cutting of likin suffered a great obstacle. No wonder the central government, even if it had resolutions, could not carry them out. Now, the warlords have been completely eliminated, and true unification has been realized. From now on, the central government's decrees can reach the whole country, and of course, the financial unification will not be a problem. The National Government, in accordance with the resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session, issued an order to abolish likin on January 1, 1931. May I ask which province would dare to resist? The decades of abuses suffered by our merchants will be lifted once and for all, and the development of industry and commerce will be inevitable. This is an extremely gratifying event. There is also a matter that is very closely related to merchants, and not only merchants, which is the strict suppression of bandits. The suffering of merchants from the Communist bandits in the past year or two is really hard to describe in words. To take a closer look, for example, the pig transportation industry in Jiangbei has suffered from the devastation of the Communist bandits in Taiyu. Kidnapping people and robbing goods is regarded as commonplace. If this continues, not only will the freight transportation not be smooth, but also the merchants will be hesitant to invest. Now, the Fourth Plenary Session has decided to strictly suppress the bandits, and Chairman Jiang will also inspect the three provinces of Xiang, Jiangxi, and Hubei, where the Communist bandits have wreaked the most havoc. As for the location of the capital and the neighboring provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, they will naturally pay close attention. It can be expected that the bandits will be suppressed in the near future. From now on, the Communist bandits can be suppressed, and likin will be abolished. I think the commercial sector will definitely be able to achieve the goal of "goods flowing smoothly." The other four major points of regularly convening national conferences, concentrating talent, improving the system, and completing local autonomy are all the wishes of the people of the whole country. The Fourth Plenary Session had clear resolutions on all of these. In the past, all matters were affected by the division of the remaining warlords, and the central government was busy suppressing the rebellious military. Now that Yan and Feng have left, the foundation of the party and the country is becoming more and more stable. Since the Fourth Plenary Session has made these resolutions, the government should be responsible for abiding by them, and the people should also do their best to assist and pay attention to practical work. All oral work, such as slogans and banners, articles, and all meetings that do not contribute to practical results should be reduced one by one. If everyone develops their spirits and buries themselves in work and does it conscientiously and practically, I think the results will be very impressive in three or five years. The brother feels that the importance of the relationship between the Fourth Plenary Session and industry and commerce will be presented as a brief report. At the end, the staff gave a lecture on the meaning of the party "titled Gandhi's non-cooperation doctrine."</p>

<h3 id="e128">Chinese Silk Disappears from the Korean Market <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese government implements harsh taxes to curb the sales of Chinese silk</p>
<p>Merchants retreat, and Chinese silk has disappeared for six years</p>
<p>Chinese silk is particularly beautiful, inexpensive, and welcomed by Koreans</p>
<p>If harsh taxes are abolished through negotiations, sales will surely be prosperous again</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association specially entrusted Consul General Zhang Weicheng to conduct an on-the-ground investigation of the tax rate on Chinese silk in Korea in order to clarify the situation. Zhang Jun's reply to the association has been notified to the silk weaving industry groups in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces for reference. The original letter is recorded below:</p>
<p>Respectfully informing you that the Chinese Consulate General in Korea recently replied to a letter stating that it was entrusted to investigate the tax rate of Chinese silk in Korea and the preferences of the Korean people. After instructing the Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Pyongyang and Zhennampo to investigate, they replied. It is now being forwarded for your information. I hope that your organization will inform your members for reference.</p>
<p>Letter from the Chinese Consulate General in Korea, Business No. 83: I, the Consul General, have learned that the leaders of your branches and the Suzhou Cloud Brocade Guild inquired about the tax rate and sales of Chinese silk in Korea when passing through Shanghai. While this was being processed, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce ordered an investigation into the population tax levied by the resident country on our country's silk and silk fabrics, the previous tax rate, the current tax rate, the preferences of the people of that country for silk fabrics, and the sales of our country's silk fabrics in that place. We were asked to investigate and report in detail which item is the most sold. Upon receiving this order, we conducted separate investigations. We have now received reports from the Chinese Chambers of Commerce in Pyongyang and Zhennampo. In addition to reporting, we are extracting the relevant documents from the letters of each association for your reference. This is addressed to the China National Products Maintenance Association. Zhang Weicheng, Consul General of China in Korea, November 14, 1920, Republic of China.</p>
<p>Excerpt from the letter from the Pyongyang Chinese Chamber of Commerce (above omitted): Since the Japanese government implemented a tax rate of 100% on the value of our country's silk fabrics in 1924 in order to curb the sales of our country's silk fabrics, merchants have been troubled by the impact of this luxury tax rate. They are afraid of buying silk fabrics from their home country, just like tigers and wolves. Time flies, and our country's silk fabrics have disappeared from Pyongyang. It has been six years in the blink of an eye. Currently, only one or two companies sell summer cloth from Shanghai in the summer, but the sales volume is very small, not as prosperous as before the luxury tax rate. As for the preferences of Koreans in Pyongyang for our country's silk fabrics, it is enough to make our country's merchants hold great hope. Because our country's silk fabrics have exquisite patterns, solid quality, and durability, which cannot be compared with silk fabrics from other countries. No matter what kind of silk fabric from our country, it is welcomed and used by Koreans and praised for its good quality and low price. In short, the disappearance of our country's silk fabrics from the market for six years is all due to the luxury tax rate. If the government earnestly negotiates with the Japanese government with the spirit of national diplomacy to eliminate the luxury tax rate, how difficult would it be to restore the prosperous sales of silk fabrics as before? I hope that it will be forwarded for your reference. Zhennampo Chinese Chamber of Commerce's case, Letter No. 252 from your consulate, ordered us to investigate and report the population tax rate, people's preferences, and the majority of sales items of our country's silk fabrics and satin in the resident country. Upon receiving this order, our association has successively completed the investigation of this port and submitted the investigation table together with the document for your review and transmission.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Rally to Support Xiao and Oppose the Dutch <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Scheduled to Open Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Please Have the Authorities Send Personnel to Guide</p>
<p>The rally to support Xiao and oppose the Dutch, organized by the Overseas Chinese Federation, Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association, and 20 other groups in this city, is scheduled to be held tomorrow at the City Chamber of Commerce. Yesterday, the association specially submitted a document to the Longhua Garrison Headquarters, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, requesting that they send personnel to attend and provide guidance. The original document and response letters from various parties are compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Document to the Three Agencies: Respectfully, the news that Ms. Xiao Xin'an, a female teacher from our country, was brutally raped by the first and second mates of the Jabaad, a steamer of the Java Company, in a planned and organized manner, has aroused universal indignation. In addition, the Dutch government has massacred tens of thousands of our overseas Chinese compatriots over the years, and imprisoned and expelled countless party committee reporters and teachers. In its governing Dutch constitution, it openly stipulates that Chinese people are an inferior race, in the same category as indigenous people, which is even more intolerable. Therefore, we are jointly initiating and scheduling the Shanghai All-Circles Rally to Support Xiao and Oppose the Dutch on November 26th (Wednesday) at 1 p.m. at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce at Tianhou Bridge to discuss various measures to assist Ms. Xiao and alleviate the suffering of overseas Chinese compatriots in the Dutch colonies. This matter concerns the patriotic movement, and we earnestly request your honorable leadership to approve sending personnel to attend and provide guidance, so as to avoid mistakes. We are extremely grateful.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Letter: Respectfully, we previously received your letter from the 12th of November, regarding the insult suffered by Ms. Xiao Xin'an when she went abroad. You requested that we join the support association to discuss methods of avenging her and alleviating the suffering of overseas Chinese compatriots in the Dutch colonies. Upon receiving this, we replied and submitted it to the 16th executive committee meeting of our association. Everyone agreed that Ms. Xiao, a priest traveling to the South Seas, suffered a strange humiliation, which is extremely infuriating. It was unanimously resolved to join and follow your association to jointly plan resistance, etc. Accordingly, we are sending this letter for your information. Respectfully, Overseas Chinese Federation.</p>
<p>Warning to Lin Guogeng: Overseas Chinese Expelled from the Capital Are Extremely Angry at the Xiamen Garrison Commander's Interference in the Xiao Case, and Specifically Sent a Telegram to Advise Lin Guogeng Not to Be a Running Dog of Imperialism. The telegram said: Commander Lin of Xiamen, be advised that since the Xiao case occurred, the whole country has been indignant. Please do not interfere with the boycott of Dutch goods movement. If you violate public opinion and willingly act as a running dog of imperialism, this association vows to deal with you to the death. Overseas Chinese Expelled from British and Dutch Colonies in Southeast Asia Support Association for Promoting National Diplomacy.</p>
<p>Please Prevent Leasing the Wharf: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company recently has a plan to lease the China Merchants Wharf to the Java Company. The Fifth Wharf Workers' Union of the company believes that the Xiao case has not yet been resolved, and it seems inappropriate for the company to suddenly lease the wharf to the Java Company that caused the Xiao case. Therefore, they sent a letter to the Xiao Case Support Association yesterday requesting negotiations with the company to prevent this. The original letter is recorded below: Respectfully, we have recently learned that our company's China Merchants Wharf will be leased to the Dutch merchant Java Company. Now that your support association is leading the anti-Dutch movement, please pay attention to this. We earnestly request that you send a letter to the General Management Office of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to seriously prevent this before the Xiao case is resolved. Respectfully, Xiao Case Support Association.</p>

<p>Taking Advantage of the Situation to Kidnap a Child</p>
<p>Demanding a Ransom of a Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>Five robbers, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, broke into the home of Long Yuankui at No. 487 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, at about 11 a.m. yesterday. They intimidated the victim with guns and arbitrarily searched the premises for half an hour before leaving. The exact amount of clothing and cash stolen is unknown. The robbers were not satisfied with what they got and kidnapped his two-year-old child named Shu Xin, claiming that they would only release him for a ransom of a thousand dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Self-Confessed Kidnapper <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Ji Zhengxing, a Yancheng native residing near Yangjing, Pudong, reported to the Second Branch of the Third District a week ago that his daughter, San Guniang, was kidnapped by Zhou Guangwen, Zhou Guangcheng, Zhou Guangwu, Zhou Guangsheng, and Zhou Wu, five brothers, who demanded a ransom. He requested that they be arrested and investigated. The police immediately arrested Zhou Guangcheng and Zhou Guangwu, while the rest fled. The police believed that the case involved accusing kidnappers, so they transferred the arrested persons to the District Court for investigation. Meanwhile, they notified Lu Changgao, Zhou's second landlord, to hand over Zhou Guangwen within a week for verification. Yesterday, Zhou Guangwen suddenly surrendered to the police station with Qiu Changwen, claiming that Ji Zhengxing was his uncle-in-law. The kidnapping of his daughter, San Guniang, on the 7th of this month, as alleged in the case, was completely false. His daughter had gone to the home of relatives in the South Wharf. He was falsely accused of kidnapping and his brother was arrested. He panicked and fled to Puxi. Now he has come to the police station to surrender. Regardless of whether it is true or not, he should be handed over immediately. He was immediately presented to the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the court for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Distributing Regulations on Joint Police-Civilian Defense <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>Yuan Liang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, drafted regulations on joint police-civilian defense for winter defense matters, printed them into easy-to-understand explanations of bandit prevention rules, and distributed them to the directors of various districts and stations under his jurisdiction, who immediately dispatched police to distribute them to all households and businesses in the city to prevent bandits from robbing during the cold winter months. However, the jurisdiction of the Nanshi First District General Office has a large number of residents and businesses. The district chief distributed only a few of the regulations he received from the bureau. He has already discussed with the Shanghai Southern Commercial Groups to immediately print 2,000 copies to be distributed by the association to residents and businesses to abide by the joint police-civilian defense regulations to prevent bandits from coveting and to maintain local security.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Municipal Public Works Bureau Rectifies Private Alley Street Lights <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Investigate...Tenants Must Report Clearly</p>
<p>Rectify...Property Owners Must Install Quickly</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Works Bureau is actively rectifying street lights in the city, sparing no effort. All highway street lights have been replaced and added with new styles as much as possible, and the lights are neat, bright and radiant, changing the previous dilapidated and dim appearance, which is very beneficial to traffic and security. As for private alley street lights, the bureau believes that their nature should be managed by the property owners themselves. Therefore, since June of the 18th year, all private alley street lights in the city have been the responsibility of the property owners. However, it has been found that there are places in various neighborhoods that have no street lights, or that have no street lights and the installations are unsuitable or poorly managed. Therefore, in early April of the 19th year, the Municipal Government approved and promulgated the Regulations on Eliminating Private Street Lights to rectify this situation. To facilitate the property owners, measures were formulated for the bureau to install private street lights on their behalf, stipulating that property owners could request the bureau to install or manage them on their behalf, as long as they bear the corresponding costs of labor and materials or management. The bureau's handling of this work starts with an investigation. First, the Public Security Bureau's various district stations are asked to report private alleys without street lights, and then the bureau sends personnel to conduct on-site investigations to facilitate gradual rectification. However, there are quite a few tenants who do not know the situation and are hesitant to answer directly when investigators inquire about the names and addresses of property owners, making it impossible to understand. On the property owner's side, they often delay installation or improvement, which is a lack of cooperation. Private alley street lights are large enough to prevent the concealment of petty thieves and facilitate the arrest of police officers, which is related to public security. Small lights do not cause the hardship of groping and bumping around at night, which is beneficial to the residents. In the property owner's layout of this bright and convenient facility, it can also make the property rental popular and increase its value. Therefore, private alley street lights are not only required by the municipal government to strictly rectify, but also property owners and tenants should work together to make them universally installed and always keep them bright.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Municipal Workers' Union Declaration on the Xin Case <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Important Meeting of All Circles Xin Case Support Association Today</p>
<p>Since the Sampan Man Xin Dingxiang was pushed into the Huangpu River by French sailors for no reason and died tragically by drowning, all circles in Shanghai have been deeply indignant and have organized support associations to achieve the goals of punishing the murderers and compensating for the losses. The municipal government has also repeatedly negotiated with the French authorities through Secretary Geng Jiaji. Although there have been expressions of punishing the murderers and compensating for the losses, there are no definite measures. Therefore, the Xin Case Support Association of all circles is still actively proceeding and has scheduled another important meeting at the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association at 2 p.m. today. Yesterday, all workers' unions in the city also jointly issued a declaration to support the Xin case. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>To the National Compatriots: Since the tragic case of Xin Dingxiang being pushed into the Huangpu River and drowned by French sailors occurred, the Shanghai labor unions, seeing that their compatriots were innocently killed by foreigners, for the sake of the country's status and the protection of the nation, were outraged and organized support associations to proceed separately. On the one hand, in the name of all Shanghai labor unions, they requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to inform the French imperialists to punish the chief culprits and to pursue compensation and pensions. On the other hand, they engaged in various propaganda activities to awaken the Chinese nation to resist the French imperialists and to demand that the whole country sympathize with and assist in the tragic death of Xin Dingxiang. Although we have been calling out until our lips are parched and our strength is exhausted, we are still continuing unremittingly, which is enough to express the spirit of the national movement that has been madly developed. Considering that this has happened, although the government has negotiated and the labor unions have assisted one after another, the French imperialists are cunning and sly, and they have submerged the facts and sold hypocrisy to deceive people in an attempt to deal with the matter with compromise. Alas, national compatriots, are we human beings or are we different from foreign people? The imperialists openly picked up and killed foreign compatriots in the 20th century civilized country, killing them in a way that was worse than being a slave. Is this right? Therefore, we believe that any imperialist's ambitious and arbitrary killing of our compatriots is to reduce the country's strength and to eliminate our country. Therefore, the massacre of our compatriots is the consistent policy of the imperialists to love the country and preserve the nation. We earnestly hope that the national compatriots will unite and rise up in response to the tragic death of Xin Dingxiang by French sailors and become a powerful backing for the government. We will not rest until we achieve the goals of punishing the murderers, compensating for the losses, apologizing, and guaranteeing that similar incidents will not occur in the future. We hereby declare this.</p>

<p>Liang Jintang Cleverly Uses a Beauty Trap</p>
<p>Xu Qichang Loses Over a Hundred Dollars</p>
<p>Meeting on the Road, Accusing Each Other in Court</p>
<p>Liang Huangzhen Marries an Indian Again</p>
<p>Xu Qichang, a Shaoxing native residing at No. 1036 Wuzhou Road, Hongkou, is forty-five years old and saddened by the loss of his wife. His Cantonese friend Liang Jintang knew that he wanted to remarry and wanted to take the opportunity to defraud him. He came up with a plan. On June 12th of this year, he specially went to Xu's residence and said that he had lost his job in Shanghai and urgently wanted to return to his hometown, but he had no boat to Guangzhou. If he wanted to stay, he had no place to live. Xu thought of their friendship, so he housed and fed him. After Liang lived there for several days, he suddenly went out and brought back two young women. He introduced them to Xu, saying that one named Liang Huizhen was Liang's elder sister, and one named Liang Huifang was Liang's younger sister, both of whom were not yet married. The two felt affection for each other and planned to have the elder sister offer herself as a wife. Xu was just about to do so, so he allowed the three siblings to live in his residence. Liang also said that after he returned to Guangzhou to inform his mother, he would come to Shanghai again to proceed with the elder sister's marriage. Then he borrowed thirty gold dollars from Xu as travel expenses to return to his hometown. On the morning of the 14th of this month, Liang said that there was a boat going to Guangzhou and he had to go to a certain steamship wharf to buy a ticket first. At this time, Xu and Liang had changed from friends to prospective family, so he saw Liang off at the steamship wharf with a heartfelt farewell. After Xu returned home, he delayed until noon before returning. Then the sister flowers were gone. He checked the suitcases and all the leather and silk clothes were gone. The estimated loss was about one hundred and seventy dollars. Xu then realized that he had met a con artist. Because he had no way to find out where those people were, he left it alone. Until the afternoon of the other day, Xu was strolling on Zhoujiazui Road and unexpectedly met Liang Huizhen. He immediately arrested her and took her to the Harbin Police Station. She confessed that Liang Jintang and Liang Huifang were hiding at No. 1907 Dongyouheng Road. They were taken to that place and arrested together. Under investigation, it was said that Liang Huizhen had married an Indian named Ara Mayut on the 12th of this month as his wife. However, when the detective sent a Western detective to the British Consulate to inquire, the British Consulate did not issue the marriage certificate for the two. Yesterday morning, they were all sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Feng Shide questioned them. Xu Qichang detailed the experience of being cheated. The defendant Liang Jintang confessed that Liang was having an affair with my elder sister Huizhen and I did not introduce them. My sister Huifang and I lived in Xu's house and were also invited by Xu. That day I went to the steamship wharf to find a boat and Xu did not go with me. My sister took her clothes and bag with her and went to the French Concession with my sister because my sister said that she did not need to return to Xu's house, so she stayed in a hotel for a few days and then we separated. Liang Huifang also confessed that Xu had an affair with my sister and then ordered my siblings to live in his house. Later, my sister pawned her clothes. Liang Huizhen confessed that in May I met Xu on the road and he immediately used seduction to take me to a hotel and sleep with me for one night. Then Xu said that he was very rich, so I married him. I did take the clothes and they were taken after I separated from Xu. On the 12th of this month, I officially married an Indian in the church. The Indian Ara Mayut also came to court and translated that he had married Huizhen at the Muslim Church at No. 1 Zhejiang Road on the 12th of this month. The officiant was a Chinese pastor. Although the British Consulate has not issued the marriage certificate, it will issue it together with the passport after the British Consulate verifies it when it returns home. Judge Feng ordered that the three defendants, Liang Jintang, etc., be detained separately for further investigation because the police station still needed to investigate.</p>

<p>The French Consul-General, in view of the fact that the concession is a mixed area where good and bad are mixed, and that the winter season has arrived, and the issue of public security is of great importance, has ordered all detectives to increase the number of armed detectives to patrol the roads in the new and old concessions every night. If there are people who are suspicious, they are allowed to check at any time whether they are carrying dangerous items in order to maintain the safety of residents and shops in the concession.</p>

<p>Sun Yu Fang Will Go to France to Purchase Equipment Soon</p>
<p>After the judicial administration department recovered the French rights in the concession, it believed that the examination was of great importance and should take this opportunity to recover and handle it on its own. Sun Yu Fang was specially commissioned to come to Shanghai to prepare for the establishment of a legal medical examination institute. In recent months, the examination institute and hospital to be established have been determined to be built near Zhenru. Now, Sun believes that he still needs to purchase all kinds of medical equipment and supplies, and that funds are insufficient, so he has specially requested the Ministry of Justice to allocate funds for him to go to France to purchase them. The Ministry of Justice, according to the report, instructed the Special District Court to allocate 50,000 yuan, which was issued in full by President Yang. It is heard that Sun will set off from Siberia to France soon, and the journey will take three months to return to the country.</p>

<p>The sand boat Ling Baoyuan recently loaded 4,000 dan of yellow sprouts in Jiaozhou, Shandong, and sailed to Shanghai to hand them over to a certain receiving agency. On the 19th of this month, when it sailed on the sea surface of Lishun Port, more than 100 li outside Wusongkou, it suddenly encountered two pirate ships sailing towards it, firing guns at the Ling boat and ordering it to stop. The Ling boat saw this and pulled up the sails and sped forward, but was spotted by the pirates who fired their guns and sailed after it. The Ling boat was hit by many bullets and three crew members were also wounded by the bullets. All the crew members were panicked and the two pirate ships chased after it. The pirates swarmed onto the ship with guns and searched everywhere. They did not see any silver dollars, which angered the pirates, who beat the crew members and searched them for everything they had. They forced the Ling boat to sail and the two pirate ships guarded behind it. They sailed to the coast of Jiangbei and stopped. The pirates searched again and beat the shipowner, forcing him to hand over the silver dollars. The shipowner replied that there were no silver dollars in the ship. The pirates moved his bedding boxes, etc., to the pirate ship. The pirates left the ship and took five crew members away, telling the shipowner to prepare the money and come to redeem them quickly. The two pirate ships fled to the sea area of Jiangbei. After the pirates left, the Ling boat sailed to the Zhihe River and stopped. The injured crew members were sent to the hospital. Yesterday, the shipowner took a train to Shanghai to report the various cargo numbers and hired a boat to unload the cargo in the ship. Only the Ling boat had to be repaired before it could sail. The loss has already been considerable.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Municipal Council Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News says that the directors of the Public Concession Municipal Council and the staff lawyers of the dog racing tracks gathered at the British Consulate this afternoon (24th) to discuss with the British Consul-General Brenan the method of permanently closing the Mingyuan and Shenyuan dog racing tracks. However, news reporters were prohibited from attending the meeting. It is reported that the British Consul-General had summoned representatives of the two tracks to a meeting last Monday. The results were not officially announced. It was only heard that the Municipal Council had informed the two tracks that it intended to order them to close after the end of this season. In addition, the regular meeting of the Municipal Council was originally scheduled for Wednesday. This week, because Mayor Zhang Qun of Shanghai was invited to a tea party at the Great China Hotel that evening, the meeting will be postponed to Thursday. It is expected that the dog racing issue will also be discussed at that time and a practical method will be decided.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Case of Japanese Automobile Injuring a Person <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The Deceased Was in a Very Difficult Situation</p>
<p>Waiting for Verification Before Review</p>
<p>The Japanese man Yoshioka Tozai was driving a car westward on Huade Road and passing Taopeng Road a few days ago when the driver suddenly veered to the left, causing the car to hit three people on the left side. Detective Zhang Desheng saw this, copied the car number, and sent the injured to Tongren Hospital for treatment. One of them, named Chen Qiaoguo, was the most seriously injured and died shortly thereafter. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Corpse Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, Prosecutor of the Special District Court, accompanied the forensic doctor to the office to verify the death. He took his seat in court and questioned the Japanese Yoshioka Tozai. He claimed that the accident was caused by two cars driving fast in front of him, and his car followed behind. After the two cars passed, the deceased walked in, causing the accident. In addition, Chen Lu, the wife of the deceased, complained that she was 23 years old and that the deceased was her husband. He was a peddler and in a very difficult situation. Xu Jun said that the details of the case were not yet clear and that the injured should be summoned to testify before reviewing the case. He then ordered the body to be handed over to his wife for coffining and burial and ordered the police station to verify the case before reviewing it.</p>

<p>The Judge Ordered the Family of the Deceased to Sue in Court</p>
<p>The laborer Jin Jin was crossing the road from west to east on Fujian Road at 6:50 p.m. the night before last when a trolleybus No. 209 sped north from the south and knocked him down instantly. When the driver Wu Guangzhao stopped the car, Jin had suffered a severe injury and was bleeding profusely. He was sent to the hospital by Western police, but his injuries were fatal and he died shortly thereafter. The body was taken to the Feilun Road Corpse Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, Prosecutor of the Special District Court, accompanied the forensic doctor to the office for examination. After the examination, he took his seat in court and questioned the driver and others. According to the report from the Western police chief, there was no evidence, so he did not file a public lawsuit against the driver. Prosecutor Xu then told Jiang Shuangquan, the family of the deceased, that since the police station was not filing a lawsuit, you could file a private lawsuit in court. The Western police chief replied that the police station did not deliberately refuse to file a lawsuit because detectives were sent to the scene of the accident immediately after the incident to investigate. However, the shop assistants in the nearby shops all claimed that they did not pay attention to the situation at the time, so the police station could not obtain evidence and failed to prosecute. Xu then ordered Jiang Shuangquan to sign a guarantee to receive the body for coffining and burial and ordered him to file a lawsuit in court.</p>

<p>The Women and Children's Asylum (also known as Qingjietang) on Penglai Road in the city is an educational and care center for orphans and widows. A woman surnamed Li in the asylum is over thirty years old. She became a widow early and was admitted to the asylum for care. Recently, she has been suffering from mental illness, laughing, scolding, and cursing intermittently. In recent days, her madness has intensified, causing panic among the women and children staying in the hall, who are deeply afraid of being beaten and humiliated by her. Therefore, they petitioned the director of the asylum for disposal. The director reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for review and decision. Yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting it to send the mad woman surnamed Li to the Xin Puyu Hall for treatment. The bureau instructed the Second Precinct of the Second Division to dispatch police to the asylum to send the mad woman for treatment.</p>

<p>Once is bad enough; must it happen again?</p>
<p>Fengtai Lumber Company at the New Wharf in the southern part of the city has been open for quite some time and usually has prosperous business. A few days ago, a man resembling a worker came to the company and claimed that he was sent by the owner of Xu Yuanji Construction Company at No. 12 Chezhan Road to purchase lumber and other materials. After speaking, he presented a slip of paper from the construction company, which was stamped with the company's letterhead seal. Since the lumber company had previous dealings with Xu Yuanji and saw the stamped note, they did not suspect anything. The staff member came out to serve him and, as usual, the man selected many top-grade timbers and hired a cart to transport them away. Afterwards, the lumber company sent a staff member to Xu Yuanji to collect the receipt, but the construction company said that they had not sent anyone to pick up the goods, nor had they issued a note as proof. The staff member reported back to the company, and they realized that they had been swindled, but the goods had already been taken away and there was nothing they could do but sigh in vain. Unexpectedly, yesterday at around 9 a.m., the man came to the company again, wanting to select and purchase lumber. The company immediately asked him to wait a moment while notifying Xu Yuanji to send a staff member, Zhou Yongsheng, from Pudong, to come and investigate. He found that there was no such person in the factory and realized that he was a swindler. He immediately went outside and summoned the police officer Zhang Yingxu, who was on duty at the 13th guard post in the area. They arrested the man and took him to the First Precinct of the First Division. During the preliminary trial by the station chief, the man confessed that his name was Shi Jingen, 19 years old, from Pudong, and that he lived on Fumin Road and worked as a carpenter. He knew that Xu Yuanji had dealings with the lumber company, so he privately carved the company's seal and impersonated them to take the lumber from the lumber company. He had been quite successful the first time, so he planned to try this trick again, but unexpectedly he was arrested. Because the matter involved a fraud case, he was ordered to prepare a document to be sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e159">An Appeal from the Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Disaster Relief Association submitted a document to Chairman Jiang, which stated: "Submitting this document on behalf of the gentlemen and merchants who have suffered in eastern Jiangxi, who have come to appeal and present their views to Your Excellency. Since last winter, the bandit forces in the counties under the jurisdiction of Guangxin Prefecture in eastern Jiangxi have been rampant, and land and water transportation to and from Nanchang has been cut off. As a result, refugees from the six counties above Yiyang and Hengfeng have been taking the counties under the jurisdiction of Quzhou, Zhejiang, as their temporary homes for more than ten months. The elderly and young are helping each other, like ants, and the total number is unknown, perhaps millions, and their situation is extremely miserable. Recently, we heard that Your Excellency's suppression of the rebels has been successful, the great difficulties have been overcome, and the triumphant song has echoed far and wide. Everyone believes that the government has ample time and the military has ample strength, and that the small rebels in the remote corners are not worth defeating. Therefore, representatives from all walks of life have been gathered and sent to the capital to present four suggestions for restoring security in eastern Jiangxi. When Your Excellency passed through Shanghai, we personally presented the original text. I believe that you will consider the fact that this association is a relief organization. They have come to appeal and express their feelings with tears in their eyes, requesting another word to be heard. The plea is sincere, and we dare not refuse. We have carefully examined the opinions expressed by the refugees: (1) Please send a brigade of troops to enter eastern Jiangxi from Zhejiang. (2) Please issue a clear order to specially appoint Guo Tong, a gentleman from Shangrao, to return to his hometown to handle post-disaster relief and local cleansing matters. (3) Please issue a clear order to allocate salt tax revenues from eastern Jiangxi for post-disaster expenses. (4) Please lend one or two million in public bonds to provide disaster relief. After researching these suggestions, the members of this association believe that they are reasonable and feasible. We respectfully present a detailed explanation to Your Excellency. Your Excellency’s newly transferred divisions are entering Jiangxi from Jiujiang, heading to Nanchang and Raozhou to separately suppress the two groups of bandits in western and eastern Jiangxi. The bandit forces in western Jiangxi are extremely strong and close to Nanchang, so it is natural to enter from Jiujiang. For the moment, we will not discuss this. Although the bandit forces in eastern Jiangxi are not very strong, their nests are actually within the territory of Guangxin, relying on the mountains for support. The only way to pursue them is by going upstream from Raozhou, which is only about 400 miles by boat and takes half a month. Moreover, the northeastern border of Guangxin relies on the Xianxia, Jin, and Da Mountains for its dangerous terrain. If the army chases from below, it will inevitably force the bandits to flee into the mountains and escape to the borders of Zhejiang, Anhui, and Fujian. If we want to completely eliminate them, it will inevitably take time. The difficulties of Tonggu in the early Qing Dynasty and the occupation of Guangzhou and Yuanzhou by Hong Yang required several years of effort to overcome. The lessons of the past should be heeded. Moreover, today, the borders of Zhejiang and Anhui are where refugees from eastern Jiangxi are secretly resting. If the bandits are forced to flee there, will it not be like hungry tigers entering a flock of sheep? If heavy troops advance along two routes, with one brigade entering from Raozhou to quell the chaos and another brigade entering Yushan from Quzhou to adopt a containment strategy, making it impossible for the bandits to flee into the mountains, then they can be eliminated in the shortest possible time. The advantages are: First, troops can reach Yanzhou from Hangzhou by waterway and then walk to Yushan in four days, which is less than one-third of the time it takes from Raozhou. Second, refugees along the Zhejiang border can gradually return to their hometowns as the troops advance, avoiding the increasing cold in winter and the fear of bandits fleeing. Third, it is more difficult to suppress the bandits if they enter the mountains. Raozhou and the area below are mostly plains and swamps. The bandits are skilled at using mountains, but they lack the cover of plains, the artillery for hiding in swamps, and the boats for crossing water. Therefore, if they are forced from above to flee below, the roots can be completely eradicated. Fourth, it is necessary to divide the troops and enter from Zhejiang. The bandits have occupied eastern Jiangxi for years and implemented a land distribution system, so all the people who have not fled have been assimilated by the bandits, which is why the bandits are not easy to suppress because the people are helping them. If we kill all of them at this time, it would be a terrible tragedy. If we ignore them, it will be easy for them to be used by the bandits. Therefore, local cleansing is necessary when the army arrives. The fields have been flattened by the bandits, and all the deeds and maps have been looted. The displaced people have long suffered from hunger and cold and are eager to return home to rebuild their livelihoods. If they are prevented from returning, they will have no food or clothing. If they are allowed to return on their own, they will ultimately have no way to make a living. If the fields are not cleared, there will be no way to cultivate them. If the people do not cultivate them, there will ultimately be no food or clothing. Therefore, post-disaster relief is necessary. All of these measures require local, fair-minded gentry to take responsibility. Guo Tong, a standing director of this association, is from Shangrao County. He is an honest, upright, experienced, and knowledgeable person. The people of eastern Jiangxi praise him. He has duties at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but his hometown has urged him to uphold justice. His family's home, family, and property have been severely damaged, so he is filled with righteous indignation and is willing to restore security in eastern Jiangxi as his own responsibility. If Your Excellency could personally appoint him as a special envoy for post-disaster relief and allow him to take a few months of leave to return with the army to handle all post-disaster affairs, he would be able to work with the fair-minded gentry and merchants in various places to properly plan everything. Establishing a foundation of good governance in eastern Jiangxi based on the principle of self-governance would be helpful to other places. Moreover, we have heard that a secretary recently dispatched by the province has been given full authority to gather the security regiments of Shangrao, Yushan, and Guangfeng counties, obtaining hundreds of guns and mobilizing tens of thousands of refugees to cleanse the countryside. From Shangrao downwards, they have gradually reached the border of Hengfeng County. The regiment soldiers have no training and are using the name of suppressing bandits to buy and sell refugees. They are mostly motivated by revenge and are indiscriminate in their killing, targeting anyone they see as a threat. This will result in eastern Jiangxi suffering another great calamity. The social order in eastern Jiangxi has been completely destroyed. At this time, land taxes cannot be collected, public assets have been wiped out, and it is impossible to collect donations from the private property of the people. If we want to seek post-disaster relief, wouldn't it be the same as trying to cook without rice if we don't separately allocate a large sum of money? The request to allocate revenues from the Yushan tax and donation bureaus for temporary use in local areas is a fair solution. However, the salt import donation from Zhejiang in Yushan, when it was well-governed, amounted to 60,000 units per year, with each unit being three dan and each dan being donated 6 jiao of silver, which has recently increased to 2.4 yuan, totaling about 40,000 yuan per year. This is an additional harsh tax outside the law. The people's strength has been exhausted after the chaos, and in theory, it should be exempt. Moreover, since the bandit rebellion, the population has sharply declined, and the sales have been less than 20-30%. At this time, rather than allowing it to be embezzled, it is better to clearly allocate it for public use in the local area. This is also a reasonable approach. However, it must be clearly stated that the donation amount should not be increased again due to the decrease in sales. This is necessary in view of the increasing trend in the past. The special consumption tax in Yushan is about 100,000 yuan per year, but it has also sharply declined. Those who are embezzling have long been silent and have not paid a penny for the bandit rebellion, so it is okay to allocate it for post-disaster relief. However, the total monthly revenue of the two bureaus is only 30,000 yuan. At this time, the first thing to do for post-disaster relief is to rectify the soldiers and police. The monthly salaries have always been in arrears, allowing them to exploit the local people. Only after everything is done well for the post-disaster relief, then the small sum of tens of thousands of yuan is far from enough. After repeated research, the members of this association believe that, during the period of bandit suppression and local cleansing in eastern Jiangxi, all tax revenues in various places should be designated for use. For example, Yushan and Guangfeng counties have suffered less damage, and Qianshan also has 10-20% of its security remaining. It is only because transportation to and from Nanchang has been cut off that it has been impossible to investigate and transfer the full amount for embezzlement. At this time, the full amount should be allocated for use, so that everything can be heard and supported. Those who collect and use the money must not embezzle it. The various post-disaster affairs can be carried out quickly. In no more than two or three months, security will gradually return to its former state. By then, all revenue will belong to the provincial treasury. The people of the fifteen counties in eastern Jiangxi used to number over six million. The most severely affected by this disaster are Yiyang, Hengfeng, and Shangrao in Guangxin, and Dexing, Poyang, and Fuliang in Raozhou. The total number of refugees in Zhejiang and Anhui is no less than two million. When they return to their hometowns, even if a few houses have survived, their homes are like being washed by water. Utensils, farm tools, and seeds are all gone. How can they resume their businesses and wait for a good harvest? Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to distribute disaster relief funds. The request to borrow public bonds is also very good. The country should be generous when it is in a time of hardship and should be happy to distribute wealth and grains. This is the good model for ancient kings to bring stability and governance, which Your Excellency should adopt. We propose that the National Disaster Relief Committee be ordered to properly plan the method of borrowing, so that the issuance of national bonds will actually ease the suffering of the people, and the repayment of the funds in the future will avoid burdening the national treasury. The cost-free approach is actually the good policy of today. However, the history of governance in Jiangxi is stained with corruption. Last year, the disaster relief funds issued by the central government to Shangrao and Hengfeng counties under the jurisdiction of Guangxin were embezzled by the county magistrates and never reached the people. Therefore, the refugees have separately submitted a report to Your Excellency for investigation. Although this matter is small, its impact is great. If the grace is not extended to the people, then all the good policies planned by the central government will be empty talk. We hope that Your Excellency will take charge and reverse this trend. The views of the members of this association are largely the same as those of the refugees. We dare not be biased towards them because of our hometown ties. To govern well, one must be impartial and consider both internal and external affairs. This is a consistent principle from ancient times to the present, both in China and abroad. Your Excellency's declaration of suppressing bandits and governing with justice and the issuance of announcements have been met with joy throughout the country. Now, what the refugees are saying is nothing more than to promote Your Excellency's intentions so that they can be put into practice. The sympathy of the assembly for the refugees is not only helpful to Your Excellency. Although the matter belongs to a corner of eastern Jiangxi, the reputation established is enough to encourage the loyalty of the twenty-seven provinces. The matter is of great importance. We hope that Your Excellency will embrace the spirit of caring for those who are drowning and feeding those who are hungry. The world has been yearning for good governance for a long time. Therefore, this association dares to plead on behalf of the millions of fathers, elders, and brothers in our hometown. We ask that you accept the feelings of the people and promptly adopt and implement them. The foundation for a peaceful and prosperous world may well begin in eastern Jiangxi. Anxious to express our words, we respectfully submit this document to the Chairman of the National Government, Jiang."</p>

Due to the request of the Anti-Drug Association, the customs tax commissioner is investigating the individuals who smuggled the drugs to clarify the truth and trace the source of smuggling. This matter is currently under thorough investigation. The various developments in this case are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Customs Continues to Inspect Drugs: The customs inspected the drugs seized for the second time on the Italian ship "Cortellena," totaling 33 boxes. When the customs officers opened the boxes, they found a large quantity of heroin. Since the ship carried a large amount of cargo, it was possible that more drugs were mixed in with other items. In view of the fact that three boxes were missed during the first search and were taken away by smugglers, the Jianghai Customs dispatched officials to the Gonghexing warehouse to continue inspecting the cargo arriving in Shanghai on the ship. They discovered more than 30 boxes of suspicious goods, and after consulting with the shipping warehouse, they were moved to the customs and combined with the 33 boxes that had already been seized. At the same time, the goods were taken out and chemically tested. The testing has not yet been completed, but it is reported that a large amount of drugs has been found.</p>
<p>Non-Drugs Returned: Among the 60 boxes of goods seized by the Jianghai Customs, seven boxes of "Cleansing Material" raw materials for writing and washing materials have been tested and confirmed to be free of drugs. Yesterday, the customs sent them back to the Italian shipping company to notify the customers to pick them up. The other goods have not been returned because the testing procedures have not been completed. The shipping company has not sent anyone to sign for and pick them up, indicating that they are afraid to do so.</p>
<p>Japanese Trading Company Involved in Drug Trafficking: The three boxes that were missed during the first search and taken away, as well as the six boxes in the second search, were all signed for by the Japanese trading company "Mcisbo Co." During the second signing for the six boxes, the customs detained them and found that they were all heroin. It has now been confirmed that the Chinese name of the company is "Ming Song Foreign Firm," and that it is responsible for receiving the nine items in both searches. They do not admit responsibility for the rest.</p>
<p>Shipping Bureau Cables Italy to Inquire: After discovering this large quantity of drugs, the Jianghai Customs sent personnel to the Italian shipping company to thoroughly investigate the Shanghai handling company. The Italian company produced bills of lading that did not have any pre-filled signing company names, so there was no way to know the buyers. Recently, due to the inquiry from the Anti-Drug Association, the Italian shipping company also wants to understand the origin and whereabouts of the goods. Yesterday, it sent a telegram to the Fiester Triest head office to inquire about the "Transport Internationaux" company that declared the goods and to inquire about the names of the purchasing companies and cargo owners in Shanghai, Dalian, and Tianjin, requesting that they be investigated and sent to Shanghai as soon as possible to clarify the situation. Once the head office replies, the Eastern smuggling organization for this drug trafficking can be identified.</p>
<p>Cargo Inspected Item by Item: Since the incident occurred, the Jianghai Customs has issued a general order requiring that all goods shipped from Europe and the United States to Shanghai, which were previously sampled for inspection, must now be opened and inspected item by item by the inspectors, and no perfunctory work is allowed to prevent drugs from entering. Therefore, the inspection of European goods arriving in Shanghai recently has been very serious, and the procedures for picking up goods have become unusually cumbersome.</p>

<p>Because Their Nature is Similar to Goods Vouchers and Deposit Slips</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued a notice to various trade associations yesterday, stating: "We hereby inform you that we received a public letter No. 28 from the Jiangsu Revenue Stamp Bureau on the 22nd of this month. The letter stated that it was acting in compliance with the order of the Jiangsu Revenue Stamp Bureau, which stated that it was following the instructions of the Ministry of Finance's Seal No. 23703, which contained a petition from Wang Zhentang, stating that, in the interest of financial management, tax rectification should come first. He has found that various gift certificates issued by major stores in various commercial ports have not been affixed with revenue stamps. Now, various deeds, account books, and invoices are all affixed with revenue stamps separately, but only gift certificates, regardless of the item or value, are not affixed with revenue stamps. This seems very unfair compared to ordinary tickets and certificates that are affixed with revenue stamps. Stores collect cash when issuing the certificates, but the tax authorities do not investigate. If the gift certificates are not guaranteed, they will become worthless pieces of paper once the store goes bankrupt. He is requesting that the ministry discuss and develop methods to classify and affix revenue stamps according to value, so as to regulate them. This would make the issuance of gift certificates by stores more credible, facilitate the exchange of gifts in society, and contribute to national taxation. In response to this, it has been found that the gift certificates, if they refer to goods on the face of the certificate, are goods vouchers issued by shops according to the provisional regulations of the revenue stamp tax. If they refer to a sum of money, they are deposit slips, and revenue stamps should be affixed separately according to regulations. In addition to issuing and distributing the above, the bureau should order the sub-bureaus to immediately forward a letter to the Chamber of Commerce to notify the various shops to comply with the regulations and ask for a reply. We have approved this request and are hereby forwarding the letter to you. Please investigate and notify the shops under your jurisdiction to comply with the regulations."</p>

<p>Director Yuan of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau recently stated that as the winter defense period approaches, the defense tasks are becoming increasingly tight. The meeting patrol locations and dates for each district and team under his command have been clearly stipulated. However, special attention should be paid to patrols in remote areas. The Puxi area, where factories are concentrated and workshops are densely packed, must have additional patrol teams assigned to patrol back and forth in groups after 6:00 PM every night. The patrol teams should also conduct detailed inspections to determine whether the patrol box in each district's jurisdiction is damaged and whether additional boxes need to be installed. A list should be submitted to the bureau to arrange for craftsmen to repair them. Yesterday, an order was issued to all subordinates to comply with these regulations.</p>

<p>— Sea Wanderer</p>
<p>Mother: Why are you clenching your teeth again because of a toothache?</p>
<p>Child (stroking his cheek, saying with a crying voice): Yes, Mom, this damned tooth really hurts terribly.</p>
<p>Mother: It's your own fault for being greedy and eating sweets.</p>
<p>Child: Mom, it's not related. When I eat sweets, all my teeth are biting together, but the only tooth that hurts today is just one.</p>
<p>A: You must be very pleased these days since you're newly married.</p>
<p>B: Pleased, of course, very pleased, but there's nothing to do.</p>
<p>A: Then how do you amuse yourselves?</p>
<p>B: The two of us sit facing each other all day long, just staring at each other. I envy her for marrying a good husband, and she envies me for marrying a good wife.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Research on the Lyrics of "Yutang Chun" <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Shaoqing</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng sings "Yutang Chun" (Gao Ting Company has this record, and Cheng Yanqiu also sings "Yutang Chun," Yuan Ban). The er-liu tune says, "Sending the gentleman back to his original prefecture, the two of them swore an oath before the lamp. The gentleman vowed not to marry another, and Yutang Chun vowed not to marry until death." Yanqiu's lyrics are different from this. Yanqiu's lyrics say, "Since the gentleman went to Nanjing, Yutang Chun is making up an illness in the north tower. If the gentleman does not marry me, Yutang Chun will keep her chastity and not marry." In one word, the difference is that one mentions swearing an oath under the lamp at night, and the other does not mention swearing an oath but only says that after the gentleman left, Yutang Chun feigned illness. The old lyrics say, "Sending the gentleman back to Nanjing, the two of them swore an oath before the gods," which means they swore an oath before the gods at the Guanyu Temple when they parted. The difference between the drama lyrics before the lamp and before the gods is like this.</p>
<p>Also, in the lyrics of Pi Huang, the "dong" rhyme and the "ren chen" rhyme are never used together, but the old lyrics of "Yutang Chun" have "Wang Jinlong," "to Hongtong," and "face flushing red," etc. The words "long," "tong," and "hong" are all in the "zhong dong" rhyme and cannot be used together. Now, Yanqiu's lyrics have changed "Wang Jinlong" to "three officials," and "face flushing red" to "face containing truth." Only the sentence "to Hongtong" has not been changed, and the word "tong" is still out of rhyme. It is difficult to think of a suitable way to change the sentence.</p>
<p>The old lyrics say, "Thirty-six thousand taels of silver turned to ashes in an instant." Some people say that thirty-six thousand taels of silver cannot be exhausted in "an instant," so Yanqiu changed it to "all." "Dan" and "gai" are both departing-tone words, which do not cause any change in the melody, so it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>The Sheng lyrics say, "The matchmaker's money is three hundred taels," while Yanqiu's lyrics say "one hundred taels." Whether it is three hundred taels or one hundred taels is a small problem. Looking at the previous singing, there is "three hundred taels of patterned silver at the first meeting," and in the white speech, there is also "there are more than three hundred taels in one hand." If there is another three hundred taels, it seems repetitive, so one hundred taels is more appropriate. These numbers are all written arbitrarily by the book writers and playwrights and are not facts, so it doesn't matter much. Three words need to be sung loudly, and one word is sung softly.</p>
<p>"First hit the gold cup and jade cup" is an old lyric, and it is still used by many people today. Gold cups can be hit, but jade cups cannot be hit, so the word "hit" should be changed to "buy."</p>
<p>"Then buy green plate and green bottle" is also a common lyric. Now Yanqiu changed it to "and buy green plate and vase." There is no big difference here.</p>
<p>"The procuress, greedy for money, sold me, sold me to Shen Yanling." This lyric by Yanqiu is very good. There is no explicit mention of selling to Shen Yanling in the common lyrics, so the sentence "A horse arrives at Hongtong" has no basis.</p>
<p>"A horse arrives at Hongtong" means that she was deceived by the procuress and sold to Shen Yanling. It is a false claim that Prince Wang passed the imperial examination and Yutang Chun went to the Tianqi Temple to burn incense to thank the gods, and then went straight to the Shen family in Hongtong County. Judging by reason, Yutang Chun must have traveled by sedan chair and not by horse. If she traveled by horse, she would not have been deceived and taken to Hongtong. The lyric "a horse" may be a mistake, or it is said that "a horse" is a kind of idiom in a certain place, such as the Nanjing colloquialism "go immediately," which means going quickly. It can be asserted that it is definitely not traveling by horse. Nowadays, people like to change lyrics, but they often don't understand the lyrics thoroughly. Why is that?</p>
<p>The most special thing is that when Huisheng sings to "The prisoner should not confess," he suddenly adds five interjectory words, "My lord, sir." Every time I listen to this piece to this sentence, I feel a special taste. People don't know where it comes from. It comes from Bangzi. This play is based on the story of Shanxi Province and was originally a Bangzi troupe script that was adapted by a Pi Huang troupe, and Huisheng was good at Bangzi in his childhood, so he added this. No one else has these five words.</p>
<p>The lyrics of Cheng and Xun's "Yutang Chun" have great discrepancies, which are omitted due to space limitations. If we compare them with Mei Lanfang, Shang Xiaoyun, and the old lyrics, the differences are even more numerous. "Yutang Chun" is a must-learn play for Qingyi actors, and the lyrics must be carefully selected, so I have listed a few points for reference.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Lu Talk <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Boying</p>
<p>In the past, Zhang Jiaying saw the autumn wind rising and missed the beauty of the Lu sliced fish and soup. He immediately ordered a carriage to return. The Lu fish has since become a historical reference for lyric writers. Among its flavors, the four-gill Lu fish of Songjiang is considered the best. My friend Mr. Tang is from Songjiang, so I asked him about it. Mr. Tang said that all the Lu fish in the world have two gills, but this one has four. It is produced under the Xiuye Bridge outside Songjiang City. Its head and cheeks are bulging, making it look fierce and hateful. It only appears when it is cold. It is most expensive before the winter solstice when it has no eggs inside, sometimes costing several times as much as ordinary fish. People don't value it much when it has eggs inside. It is best to cook it with chicken soup. Not much of it is produced each year, generally because its species is not easy to breed. It is said that Lu Chunyang passed by Songjiang and ate it and praised it, saying that it is beautiful because it is rare. If the species becomes very abundant after a few years, the taste will definitely deteriorate, so he used a spell to prevent it from increasing or decreasing year after year, which is a ridiculous story. When Su Dongpo traveled to Chibi in the Song Dynasty, the so-called Lu fish of Songjiang with huge mouths and fine scales could not be found in the new autumn. It is another kind of fish that is narrow and long like a knife fish, with only one spine and no other bones. The one with a line of black dots on its back that is six or seven inches long is the best, but it is still inferior to the four-gill one. I recorded it and told those who make food recipes.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Record of the Seventh Anniversary of Qingxin School <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Jing</p>
<p>The high-rise buildings of the Shanghai Qingxin Middle School for boys and girls stand opposite each other on Lujiabang Road, in a grand and imposing manner. There are many students, and their academic achievements are highly regarded. Its history is the longest in the country. Since the National Government established its capital in Jinling, Chinese people have been vying to reclaim educational power. The school naturally succeeded, and Master Zhang Shilin was appointed as the principal. Mr. Zhang worked hard to renovate the school affairs, which became even more developed. This autumn marks the seventh anniversary, and a grand celebration was held for three days. The 13th of the month was Student Day, and guests attended the forest dance club. The singing and dancing were ethereal and dreamlike. The 14th was Parents' Day, and the strongman Peng Fei performed in the school playground, with a 2,500-pound car running over his body. Also, Mr. Wang Huaying (a Qingxin student) performed magic tricks, biting coins and swallowing tin, suspending people in the air. The programs were truly amazing and pleasing to the audience. The 15th was Alliance Day, which was the most lively and the last day. Yan Society's box office hired Peking Opera actors. Mr. Rong Boming's "Joining the Army" and Shu Yanzhai's "Beheading the Son at the辕门" were rare among Shanghai amateur actors. The host of Suiyuxuan and Jin Biyu, the famous Kun actor of the Tianchan Stage, acted as Meilongzhen. The two actors had a beautiful appearance. Such supporting roles are more elegant, and the natural dialogue and acting are particularly special, so the applause was thunderous for a time, and many people praised them endlessly. The new play "Yang Guifei" was performed by the teachers and students of the school. Teachers Zhou Yingcai, Zhang Xuexuan, and Ge Chenjun participated in the play, which was very exciting. It is said that Jin Biyu was very active in this Qingxin anniversary celebration. Mr. Zhang had already embroidered the four characters "Yi Zan Hua" (Art in Praise of Creation), which were about ten feet long and three feet wide, lined with five-colored tassel red satin horizontal shawls. The gift was recorded with the inscription "Presented to Ms. Jin Biyu by Zhang Shilin, Principal of Shanghai Qingxin Middle School." The gift will soon be sent to the Tianchan Stage with Song Tiansheng (because his voice of praise can be heard in the sky, it was titled as Suiyuxuan) etc. to reward the lady's hard work.</p>
<h3 id="e175">News about Yang Xiaolou's whereabouts <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>

<p>The Rare News of Yesterday was Wrong</p>
<p>The manuscript "Rare News of 氍覦" published in yesterday's newspaper was published later than it should have been, so there are some changes with the facts. Here is a re-recording of the information to replace the correction.</p>
<p>Yesterday I met a Mr. Chen, who is in charge of opera at Chen's residence. He said that as of 12:00 noon yesterday (the 23rd), he had not received a telegram from Yang Xiaolou himself, or that he had canceled his trip to Shanghai due to other issues. If that is the case, then what I recorded in my article may become a false report again.</p>
<p>The fact that Xue Yanqin returned north on the 20th is absolutely true. Moreover, the train tickets needed by all of Xue Ling's troupe were also purchased by the Tianchan Stage on the evening of the 19th. Later, Chen's residence repeatedly pleaded with Xue Ling to join the hall performance and promised to handle the ticket refund procedures on his behalf. Xue Ling could not refuse due to the circumstances and had already agreed to each and every request. It is now said that Xue has changed the date of departure to the first of next month.</p>

<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>The Venerable Master Wan also said that the monks of Siam and Ceylon are not as good as those of Burma, and the Chinese monks are too inferior and must be eliminated. I asked that although the Burmese monks can uphold the prohibition against sexual misconduct better than us Chinese, they cannot keep the prohibition against killing, which is also very wrong. Master Wan said that Burmese culture and morality are very high, and monks cannot be despised by others, so they maintain their dignity to the point of killing people. But in my opinion, the Burmese are oppressed and react, so they have a strong reaction. According to the Buddhist precepts, killing and sexual misconduct are both inviolable. The difference between them and Chinese monks is that Burmese monks fundamentally uphold the alms system and do not approach money, so there are fewer opportunities to do evil. China's monastic system has its advantages and big compromises, leading to the decline of monks' conduct. Reforming the monastic system to return to the Buddhist alms system is the top priority. Another difference is that monks in Siam and Burma have extreme freedom to become monks or return to secular life. Some become monks for one day, three days, half a year, or several years. If they want to return to secular life, they can do so at any time. After becoming monks, they are still supported by their families and relatives, which does not burden society, and it is considered an honor, so everyone must go through a certain number of days of monastic life, just like we view academic qualifications. The Crown Prince of Siam must also go through several months of monastic life, like a military service system. In times of turmoil, the military service system is an obligation, but in times of peace, is the three-year monastic system also an obligation? However, once one becomes a monk, they respect teachers, uphold precepts, and serve elders just like monks, which can practice moral habits. The Burmese are so noble because of this. From the above, the Burmese monastic system differs from that of China in five ways: 1. Alms for food and does not cook for oneself. 2. The length of time spent as a monk is free, so one does not have to violate precepts. If lustful thoughts arise, one can return to secular life instead of forcing oneself like Chinese monks. 3. Not eating after noon is a violation of the rules. 4. Not vegetarian because one begs for alms and eats whatever people give. 5. One only believes in Shakyamuni Buddha as a teacher and does not believe in others, because the Mahayana is not the Buddha's teaching.</p>
<p>On the 30th, I moved to Mr. Lin Baohua's place at the Nanyang Printing Bureau. Mr. Lin told me about the history of the Shwedagon Pagoda, saying that when the Buddha was alive, two Burmese merchants went to India to visit the Buddha and asked the Buddha to give them a souvenir. The Buddha gave them a tin staff, a bowl, and several strands of hair. The merchants returned and offered them to the king, and the king built a pagoda to enshrine them. So the history of this pagoda is very long, and it was touched by Buddhism earlier than China. The Venerable Master Daojie said that this pagoda was built repeatedly by the kings of the past and was not built by one king. Once, the king ordered all the officials in the country to work, and a military officer who disobeyed the order was killed. In short, the Shwedagon Pagoda is still well-preserved and beautiful today. Although it was slightly damaged in the earthquake the other day, it is now being repaired.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Four Walls Ejecting Tears of Sorrowful Red Love, A Full House Overwhelmed by Lingering Green Sentiment</p>
<p>He said there is often a kind of woman whose looks and figure - if you say she has a problem, you really can't find anything wrong with her even if you nitpick. If you say she is beautiful, there is really nothing particularly attractive about her. She just has a "plain" quality. Many beauties often have a small flaw that can actually enhance their beauty. For example, those Western beauties who think their faces are too shiny put on many fake moles, putting one here and one there. That was popular in the last century and is still popular now. For example, smallpox scars are the deadly enemy of a beauty, and no matter how beautiful you are, you are done for. But these pockmarks, if you have one or two in the right places on your shoulder, heart, or forehead, they don't seem annoying. There is also a kind of young man with a stutter, and Zuo Shichen said he has a kind of lovable demeanor. There is also a kind of young girl with a lisp, and Zuo Shichen said she has a charming appearance like Shi Xiangyun in "Dream of the Red Chamber." In short, the overall appearance is already beautiful, and there are some small flaws, which are the so-called flaws that don't detract from the jade. Therefore, the way Green Sentiment's tongue frequently licks her cherry lips is actually considered charming. There is also a kind of habit called squinting. She doesn't seem to notice it when she's sitting there, but when she's moving, her eyes are always looking sideways and her head is always tilted to one side. That kind of squinting habit is just like the party politics in the world today, with left-leaning and right-leaning tendencies. Green Sentiment happens to be a left-leaning and right-leaning element. She often tilts her head to look to the side when she moves. Later, Zuo Shichen asked her if she noticed that squinting habit herself. She said she didn't notice it, but according to her, her environment made her develop that habit. It turned out that in her own room and in the rooms she went out to other people's houses, the rooms were full of reflective mirrors. The walls were full of large dressing mirrors, and the tops of the dressing tables and washstands were also mirrors. Even the wardrobes were covered in mirrors, and even the bed was covered in mirrors. She was just looking at her clothes in the mirror to see if they were wrinkled, if her bangs were messy, if her pants were too high or too low, and if her face was oily. Wasn't she looking at the mirror as soon as she turned her head to the side? That's how it became a habit. Some people say that this squinting appearance is not good, but Zuo Shichen said that a young girl who has fallen into prostitution is already bad enough, is there anything worse than that? Ever since Long Ziyun threw a party at the Yuebin Restaurant that day, the next day it was Zuo Shichen, the day after that it was Ling Zhixiang, and the day after that it was Lin Fanzhi. They were happy every day and always called for courtesans. Every time they called for courtesans, they always called for Green Sentiment for Zuo Shichen. Zuo Shichen didn't refuse either. By this time, Bao Meiyun's cold, which was full of flattery, had already gotten better. Long Ziyun still called for Bao Meiyun but let Green Sentiment go to Zuo Shichen. Often Bao Meiyun, A Su, and Green Sentiment came together, just like:</p>
<p>The Zen heart is not like catkins clinging to mud,</p>
<p>Again following the east wind flying up and down.</p>
<p>What will happen later? Listen to the next chapter for the breakdown.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Financial and Gold Markets Extremely Mediocre <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The trend is sluggish. The gold market yesterday, the 24th, was very peaceful and stable. There were no fluctuations, and the difference between the opening and closing prices was only two taels. Market sentiment seemed weak, and the trend was slightly downward. As for the foreign exchange market, it was calm, but the market was not smooth. Traders such as Jin'an Yan and other goods traders were all buying and selling. Changyuan Cheng Yong and other major gangs were all selling. The overseas silver market was still stable, so the market opened flat. Due to the activity of the buyers, the price suddenly rose beyond 89 taels. After Fuchang and others sold, the price gradually fell. However, there was an accumulation of one or two taels. After noon, the price was within 88 taels. Later, the Dalian gang continued to sell, but Chengfeng Yonghong Li purchased some, and the market was sluggish, fluctuating between 88 and 89 taels. It is said that there may be no special changes in the foreign silver market today.</p>
<p>Calm and peaceful. The opening price of the January gold market this morning was 587 taels and six qian, the same as last weekend. (In the rough market, with the price around eight taels, Shunhe Wanxing and others were selling a lot, and the buyers were tireless.) As for the large bars, there was no change, only the American silver was lower by one-eighth. Afterwards, there were slight increases and decreases of two or three qian. Then, Jin'an Yan, Yuxin Heng, and others bought in, and Huabi absorbed spot silver. Dalian 1 tael 2 qian 7 fen 5 hua bought Citibank in December for 38 yuan 8125, so the price was raised from 7 taels 34 qian to 9 taels 6 qian. The January British gold industry had some purchases, with a price of 171875. Megali had sold it before long, and Fuchang Yuancheng Yong and others were all selling, so it immediately fell by one shilling. The announcement was not moved, and it fell to 88 taels 45 qian. Anda also sold the January 171875 headgear, and then they sold out. The 10:30 price was 87 taels 9 qian. In a moment, goods and small households were chasing in, and Taiwan even advanced 1 tael 2 qian 7 fen 625 of Japanese silver, so it rose to 8 taels 9 qian. However, the market sentiment was uncertain, and a slight sell-off was seen on the table, and it immediately fell by ten points to 7 taels 5 qian. After that, the transaction was desolate, and foreign exchange transactions were also lackluster. Therefore, the gold market had no changes, only the price rose outside and remained constant, fluctuating between 8/8 taels. There was a twist of one or two taels. The 10:30 price was 8 taels 4, the 11:00 price was 7 taels 5, and the 12:00 price was 8 taels 23 qian. Therefore, the attitude was hesitant. The closing price was slightly inferior to one to three qian, and the announced price was still 621 taels and 2. It is estimated that there are one, three, and four taels.</p>
<p>Slightly soft. The afternoon market opened at 87 taels and 5 qian, followed by 8 taels. The Indian remittance fell by two annas, and then fell by five or six qian to 7 taels and 4 qian. At 1:30, Chengfeng Yong, Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, and others purchased, so it rose by one tael, estimated to be 8 taels 78 qian. Wanxing Shunli took this opportunity to sell, slightly frustrating six or seven qian, estimated to be 8 taels 1 qian, while the exchange rate was flat. Huabi sold the January British gold for 171875. After entering, Chengfeng Yong bought it. Yuancheng Yonghongli and others were also holding it in, and the British gold was once traded by Huabi and Zhengjin in February for 1725, so the gold market jumped by two and a half to 89 taels at 2:00. However, Wanxing Shunli Yongfeng and others were still selling, and it was suppressed by a small tael. It was also heard that the Indian remittance returned to one anna. At 3:30, it was 88 taels. At 4:00, it was raised by a few qian, estimated to be 8 taels 56 qian. At 4:30, the closing price was estimated to be 88 taels 1 qian. Compared to last Saturday, it fell by eight qian. The maximum price of the day was 89 taels 6 qian, and the minimum price was 87 taels 3 qian, with a fluctuation of two taels and three qian. The announced price was 34 taels. The registered amount was 95 taels this month, 91 taels next month, and 89 taels in January. The Pujiang water was 95 taels. The morning market for goods was 7 taels 6 qian, the noon closing was 7 taels 6 qian, the afternoon was 27 taels 8 qian, and the closing price was 8 taels 2 qian.</p>
<p>Trading is sluggish. The trading between colleagues is not very lively. It is estimated that Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, Shunli, Wanxing, Yuancheng Yong, Taiheng Yuan, etc. are all selling, and Yuda, Fuxing Yong, Jinan, Xinheng, and Yuyu are all buying. Zhifeng Yong, Dadecheng, Tong Taichangyuan Tai, etc. have different ins and outs. In the afternoon, Chengfeng Yonghongli Yuancheng Yong Yifeng Yong Dadecheng all bought in, and Yongfeng Shunli Wanxing all sold. The goods were coming in and out irregularly. Other numbers of Dawan were buying and selling sporadically. The Lianbang sold more than 2,500 bars, but bought 400 to 500 bars. The Guangdong gang was still selling a small number.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the posted rates for all currencies remained unchanged. Due to it being Monday, there were no telegrams from overseas silver markets. However, foreign exchange buying and selling by banks was still active, while the domestic market was very peaceful. The gold market fluctuated by only a few points, hovering between 88 and 89.

<h3 id="e181">Fluctuating Interest Rates <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Market Overview: The previous day saw a sharp drop in foreign interest rates and a sudden rise in silver interest rates, suggesting a special change in the situation. However, yesterday, there was a sudden reversal, with foreign interest rates increasing and silver interest rates dropping sharply. The result was generally similar to the end of last week. According to industry insiders, the reason is that the interest rate itself has no sales, so it should have a pullback. However, the banks saw the price drop and bought in, so the price recovered. The relaxation of silver supply is natural, and fortunately, there is no value for monthly assessments.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Prices: (Foreign Interest) The morning market saw a shift in sentiment, with the closing price at 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 2 hao half, changing half a li from the previous afternoon's low. The afternoon market suddenly rose to 7 hao half, reaching 7 qian 2 fen 5 li, resulting in a rebound of 1 li 2 hao half. (Equal Interest) The morning market opened at 1 qian 7 fen, only slightly less than the previous day. The afternoon market suddenly fell by 7 fen, opening at only 1 qian. The bank posted a rate of 7 fen, adding water by 4 or 5 fen, then becoming 3 or 4 fen.</p>
<p>Currency Market Conditions: Jiangnan small silver dollars opened in the morning market at 6 qian 4 fen 2 li half, and suddenly rose by 1 li half in the afternoon market to 6 qian 4 fen 4 li. Transactions in the morning market amounted to 2,000 jiao, and also only 2,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars opened in the morning market at 6 qian 4 fen 1 li 2 hao half, and were 6 qian 4 fen 1 li half in the afternoon market. Transactions in the morning market amounted to 40,000 jiao, and 25,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins rebounded by 1,000 to 383,500 wen per thousand.</p>

<p>The yarn market is stable, with sales to Sichuan being active due to several ships heading to Chongqing. Some speculators profited from bidding on yarn and continued to short the market. New sellers were watching and not moving, so the market has stabilized recently. However, according to a Japanese merchant survey, the underlying inventory is increasing.</p>
<p>The bidding for man-made fiber slightly rose. The opening market for man-made fiber was flat, but after some Chinese merchants went short, it slightly rose by two or three points. The demand for current value yarn from Sichuan is still good, and the popularity of man-made fiber is also tight. Each month rose by two, two, four, or five qian. The afternoon market was quiet, with rises and falls of one or two qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 10,750 bales. Checking the shipments, Xinhua had 500 bales, Tianyi had 450 bales, and the rest had 200 bales. Rongxing bought 850 bales, Yuda bought 500 bales, Yifeng bought 500 bales, Tianjiang bought 600 bales, and the rest bought 1,400 bales. The closing prices are listed on the left.</p>

<p>The cotton market is bleak and lifeless. The condition of American cotton is also stagnant. Factories on the market have no need for current cotton. Manufacturers are all holding a wait-and-see attitude. In fact, the overall world situation is not good, and everyone is afraid to absorb. However, the source of Hankou is still scarce, so the bulls are also tightening.</p>
<p>Sparse Bidding for Hankou Cotton: The opening market for Hankou cotton was down five points due to the sluggishness of foreign cotton. The situation remained flat in the afternoon, down five points. The total transaction volume for the day was 43,800 dan. Checking the shipments, Guangfeng had 2,100 dan, Shen had 2,000 dan, Tianchang had 2,200 dan, Shenchang had 2,500 dan, and the rest had 1,570 dan.

<h3 id="e186">Flat Cotton Market in India Last Week <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Bombay: Business was flat last week, with very little price fluctuation. However, the arrival of cotton from Upper India is increasing daily, and the business situation is not satisfactory. It is doubtful whether the current price can be maintained. The demand for spot goods is sluggish, local manufacturers are quiet, and exporters are only buying a certain amount to offset previous shorts. European transport companies have a slight need for Pingle goods. Chinese demand is better and the asking price is appropriate. The statistics for last week are appended below (unit: 1,000 bales).</p>

<p>Liverpool: Spot sales were slow last week, and the futures market was volatile. Although the textile industry and the general situation are showing signs of decline, cotton prices are still firm. The amount of transactions between buyers and sellers is very small. Initially, Egyptian cotton saw a slight rebound due to the decision to reduce the acreage of fine-fleece cotton to be planted in the next three years, but it quickly recovered.</p>
<h3 id="e187">The Chinese Cotton Production Problem <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Since China opened up to trade, the great powers have relied on unequal treaties to implement their economic aggression policies, regarding our country as their only market. The annual trade deficit recorded in the Customs Easy Book is alarming. The greatest loss is none other than this. Advocating domestic goods to seek self-sufficiency is a national cry. However, there are many paths to advocating domestic goods, and they are not the same. Looking at the imports over the years, cotton goods are the largest, ranking first. Clothing is the first of the four necessities of life. Now, relying on foreign goods, how dangerous is this? In recent years, although the domestic cotton textile industry has gradually developed (the competition from foreign-owned yarn mills is not discussed for the time being), the annual import of cotton goods is still at 200 million taels of customs silver, which means that the trade deficit is more than 100 million taels. Therefore, revitalizing the cotton textile industry to seek self-sufficiency in clothing is a matter that must not be ignored when falsely advocating domestic goods. To revitalize the cotton textile industry, it is necessary to start with expanding cotton production and improving quality in order to enrich raw materials. Now, please briefly explain this.</p>
<p>China is a country based on agriculture, and the rise and fall of agricultural products is of great importance to the livelihoods of the people. However, in recent years, there have been natural disasters and man-made calamities, with virtually no year without them. Almost all agricultural products are trending towards failure. Everything needed for clothing and human use, which could formerly be self-sufficient and have a surplus, is now supplied by foreign countries. What will be the impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood? Is it just the end of cotton production? In the past, when China's mechanical textile industry was not developed, cotton was exported to foreign countries, in addition to what was needed for handmade textiles and clothing, as the largest part of native products for export. Since the Sino-Japanese War, yarn mills have gradually increased, and the amount used has increased. Exports have gradually decreased, and a cotton famine has occurred. Foreign cotton took the opportunity to enter. After the European War, the yarn mill industry presented unprecedented development, and the pain of insufficient cotton was increasingly felt. In recent years, the demand for cotton has increased, but the production of local cotton has not seen progress, resulting in a sharp decline in Chinese cotton exports and a sharp increase in foreign cotton imports. The surplus of decades has changed into a huge deficit.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Grain and Rice Market Turns Down Again <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the source of various gangs increased, reaching about 10. The sales on this street suddenly became sluggish. The reason is that the market trend is to divide the prices cheaper. However, the Xi price is still stable. The buyers reported a light shipment due to the abundant goods. The market price fell by two corners specially. The price is only at the 10 yuan mark. The market is high at 14 yuan 7 corners. Transactions are already rare. The situation for rice is stagnant, and the price is softening. The top price is about 11 yuan. Yangdu Xian is now also showing signs of decline, and the sales channel has suddenly weakened. There is also a lack of particularly high-quality goods. Each corner is short half a lot. The tip of the port arrives and the sales are equal to each other. There is no rise or fall in the market. The high price is still 12 yuan. Bianyuan Yin Hua's incoming goods are although the continuous sales are still active. The top Yinyuan crane's stomach is relatively refreshing, so the special high price must be left at the 12 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Hunan: Yesterday, more than 30 ships arrived from the river. The price of white rice is still between 14.95 and 6 corners. However, the ordinary middle grades have fallen by one or two, but not equally. The momentum is particularly invigorating. Therefore, although the glutinous feet are equally stable, they are also not good. The actual retail sales have caused the price to fall back by corners.</p>
<p>Xu Gao: 13 yuan and a thin South price. The price is particularly sluggish. In addition to the batch of two corners, there are still a small number of customer gangs asking, so they have stood up. The tip of the Du is becoming soft and close to each corner. The usual practice is still not isolated. The situation is flat. The Tongyuan arriving price must be 14 yuan 7 or 8 corners. The source of Yuanyuan is tending. Each sales continues. The price stays at the original price.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Xiang Rice Arrives in Increasing Quantities <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for customer Xian rice saw a gradual increase in arrivals. There were still no signs on the market. In addition to Jiangxi rice, the source of Hunan rice also saw an increase. Because there had been no exports from that area for a long time, the selling price gradually decreased. In addition, the reduction in donations, taxes, and passports, combined with the Shen price, had gradually become viable. In general, merchants were busily preparing to do business. If the market can digest, the source is expected to gradually become lively. Yesterday, the sales opened with a newly arrived cargo of Xiang machine yuan 560 bags at a price of 13 yuan 5 or 6 corners, and machine oil rice 110 bags at a price of 11 yuan, and machine Jing rice 5 bags at a price of 10 yuan 7 corners and a half. Jiangxi rice traded with 160 bags of machine early rice at a price of 10 yuan 3 corners and a half, and 377 bags of machine late rice at a price of 11 yuan 1 corner and a half to 11 yuan 4 corners and 4 points, and over 100 bags of machine yuan at a price of 14 yuan 5 points, all handled by this street. Customer gangs were watching and not moving, so the price was difficult to rise sharply for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Flour Market Driven Up by Foreign Wheat <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market: After the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon, due to the quotation of foreign wheat still rising, Chicago reported 4, 6, and 7 corners. Canada reported 8 or 9 corners and 1 yuan, which led to a rise in the sentiment of various months. It was also heard that a certain mainland gang had a strong interest in buying futures, with the number exceeding 100,000. If the environment is good, foreign wheat has risen for four consecutive days, and the market must be shaken. However, the shorts have prepared a lot of chips to fix foreign wheat, so the market is tight and the increase is not significant. As a result, this month was unchanged due to the delivery relationship. December and January rose by 1 point. February rose by 1 point and a half. March rose by 7 li and a half. April rose by 1 point.</p>
<h3 id="e191">Wheat Market Near Weakness and Far Strength <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market: After the opening of the market in the morning and afternoon, various months showed a near weakness and far strength trend. This month, due to the delivery relationship, the short side tried its best to suppress the price. Because domestic wheat has delivered high-quality goods, the short side used the arriving foreign wheat as the standard. The long side inevitably suffered a loss from this situation. In fact, due to the shortage of raw materials, foreign wheat was purchased. Now, manufacturers are using this as a tool for speculation, as if it is losing the original intention of the regulator. The distant months' people's hearts are very good because foreign wheat has been good for four consecutive days. Buying sentiment is smooth. As a result, this month fell by 2 points compared to the previous week. December fell by 2 points. January rose by 3 points. March rose by 5 points. April rose by 4 points. The current wheat market is still flat and weak. Because the standard has gradually fallen, the spot goods are difficult to stand. A total of 2,000 bags of Nanjing and Yaowan wheat were opened and handled by Huafeng.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Foreign Wheat Continues to Rise <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>At 9:00 AM on the 24th, the Datong News Agency reported that the Chicago futures for December were 7 corners 6 points, May was 8 corners 05, and July was 7 corners 8 points 125. At 1:40 PM, the Canadian telegram reported that the December wheat futures were 6 corners 4 points and a half, May was 7 corners 7, and July was 7 corners 1 point 875.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Standard Cake and Bean Market Both Decline <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Standard Beans: Yesterday's bean futures were still weak. This month's futures saw a large number of longs having to deliver, and the market had a tendency to turn sharply downwards. Fortunately, a small number of customer gangs bought and prepared to buy spot goods, which led to a small increase of one or two points. The sentiments of the distant months differed among the mainland gangs, but the atmosphere was more active and the prices were slightly two points higher. The closing prices for October were 4 taels 7 qian and a half, and the prices for November to March were 4 taels 7 qian and 7 qian 1 point.</p>
<p>Standard Cake: The opening was slightly weak, and it turned down in the afternoon. The factory side's intention to sell was very strong, and people's hearts were lacking. In addition, the raw materials were stagnant, so there was no recovery. The closing prices for March were 1 tael 5 qian 3 points 75, and the prices for April were 1 tael 5 qian 5 points 75, all down by two points and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Sugar Market: Raw Sugar and White Sugar Increasingly Downward <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from the producing areas. The current sugar price in Cuba was 1.40625, a slight increase of 3125 compared to the previous telegram. The New York sugar futures price for December was 1.11, for January of the next year was 1.45, and for May was 1.52, all falling back by 2 points. The price for May was 1.66, with no change. There was no telegram from the Java sugar market. The transactions at the general meeting were still quiet. On the 24th, He sugar's raw sugar and white sugar were offered, but the buying sentiment was bleak. The asking price was 7 taels, with no inquiries. Although a small number of buyers had a slight interest, the offering price was 7 taels 4 and a half. The number was scattered and the buyers were unwilling to lower the price due to the small number, so the bidding was not successful. However, the sales at various places have been stagnant recently, and the arriving goods have been surging, so there is much pessimism. The price of ground fine sugar white is 7 taels 5 qian 7 fen and a half. The price of medium sugar white on the 20th is 6 taels 6 qian 7 fen and a half. The price of He Chi on the 8th is 6 taels 1 qian. The progress is slack and the market is weak. The transactions of Japanese sugar are also few. The Minghua factory has already started shipping, so the upper market has also turned down. The price of J brand is 8 taels, and there is little reception. The price of YP brand is 7 taels 8 qian and a half. The price of YT brand is 7 taels 5 qian 2 fen and a half. The price of YRO brand is 7 taels and 2 fen and a half. The price of TX brand is 7 taels 8 qian. The price of Meiji YRO brand is 6 taels 9 qian. The market is not strange. There are several dozen bags of domestic Shangbing white sugar opened for sale at a price of 10 taels and 8 qian per yuan, and a high price of 11 taels. The market is still stable.</p>

<p>Haozhou red dates: The new crop's harvest is poor and land prices are quite high, so they have only arrived today, after a long delay since the new ones came out. More than 300 bags were dispatched as needed by Zhenbang merchants for all stores to distribute. As the dates are from the Yangtze River region and are therefore very suitable for sale, the asking price reached a high of 8 taels. Cantonese and Fujian merchants rushed to purchase the dates, adding a 5 qian commission.</p>

<p>Bituminous Coal: The import volume of Kelazi Lump Coal has been quite high this month, but the destination has been very congested. The inventory of each warehouse has suddenly increased. It is estimated that the current inventory is still more than 40 tons. As a result, the market price has fallen sharply. Yesterday, the market price for lump coal was only 11 taels and 1 qian 5 fen per ton, and the price for Tong coal was 10 taels, a drop of more than 2 taels.</p>

<p>American Fabric: The products made by this store do not use rayon as threads for the pattern design and structure. The silk filament and white fabric imported from Shanghai are used to meet demand. Due to the start of the spring sale, there was an opportunity to purchase. Yesterday, a total of 40 bolts of silk filament white fabric were traded. The price remains stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign tea houses in this port saw that the assistance of the Russian tea houses in the Gongxi green tea and Keemun black tea from the incoming estate had not waned, and the market transaction was not deserted. However, the recognition price was even harsher than before. Zhenmei green tea, Tongfu, Baochang, Fushi and other stores had scattered purchases and drew goods. The top price was opened at 145 taels, and the price of ordinary goods sold ranged from 47 to 63 taels, 5 or 6 taels lower than before. The market situation was unusually sluggish.</p>

<p>Cotton Cloth from Our Factory: Yesterday, the market showed a firm trend, mainly because sales to various northern ports are gradually becoming active. The demand for coarse cloth, in particular, is very strong, leading to a sudden shortage of available goods. Yesterday, the 16-pound, the five · the 13-pound, the double · the 11-pound, the three embroidered · and the Three Rabbits were all out of stock. Fine cloth also saw a slight turnaround. Flying Fish was completely snapped up by the Tianjin and Qinhuangdao gangs, selling out at 6 taels and 9 qian. Double Fish rose 5 fen yesterday, and Colored Ball rose 2.5 fen. Over 200 pieces were traded by local merchants and dyers. The Taizhou gang was actively procuring goods, so available stock is also scarce. However, Yanghe twill continues to be available, with the elephant pattern slightly decreasing by 2.5 fen due to the increasing supply. Higher-quality goods like coarse twill are relatively firm. There has been no change in the 11-pound and 12-pound goods.</p>
<p>East-West Piece Goods: The price decline has eased somewhat, and sales are more active than before. Yesterday, gangs from Sichuan, Hankou, Luoyang, Zhengzhou, and other regions were purchasing goods. Therefore, the market for eastern goods has stabilized. Yesterday, the Lake Center Association unanimously agreed that Three Sayings brand Colored Balls are still out of stock. Ancient City Association is still selling at 3 qian and 4 fen, but Water Wave is showing signs of weakening again, falling back to 2 qian, 0 fen, and 7.5 li.

<p>Inventory Is Low...Sales Are Brisk</p>
<p>Woolen goods and fabrics are selling briskly. Original goods such as overcoat wool are more popular than Huate wool. The price of woolen goods is consistently firm. Mainstream styles are rising rather than falling in price. Given the current cold weather, it is difficult to find the popular items for sale, even at a premium price. Available stock in the market is limited. Elden Plain N绒 remained scarce and continued to rise yesterday. N绒 for shoe felt and 1.6 chi wool are also increasing in price. Yuan货 wool imported at 4 taels and the newly popular camel hair scarves are all rising in price. French-made wool and chestnut-colored miscellaneous fabrics, yellow-gray Huate wool, overcoat wool, and similar items are also in short supply and selling well.</p>

Gangs from the Yangtze River inland, Fujian, and other areas are jointly purchasing, resulting in optimistic sales figures. The price of silk goods is low and rising. The market price for sizes 16 to 20 is 12 taels and 2.5 qian, and for sizes 21 to 20, it is 15 taels and 7.5 qian. Upon inquiry, it was found that sizes 24 and 20 are particularly scarce, leading to further increases in prices. Size 24 is selling at 18 taels, and size 25 at 19 taels. Regarding arrivals, it was heard yesterday that another 3,400 loads of stock have arrived at foreign warehouses, so there is no fear of shortages in the market.</p>

<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(24) — Dalian</p>
<p>After leaving the Taihua Restaurant, I borrowed a friend’s car from Lao Yang, and we arrived at the front of Tokiwa Bridge and the Tokiwa-za Theater.</p>
<p>The Tokiwa-za is a theater with an interesting architectural design. The stage is a series of receding circular arches.</p>
<p>According to Lao Yang, the Nikko-za is also an interestingly built theater, but its stage is square, the opposite of the Tokiwa-za.</p>
<p>The films shown are not new. "The Three Musketeers" starring Douglas Fairbanks was screened in Shanghai a year ago. In the right corner of the stage, there is a Japanese person translating the subtitles. This is the same as in theaters in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The enchanting scent of greasepaint and powder from the Japanese women in the front and back of the theater is truly nauseating. It's strange why Japanese women like to use such extremely pungent fragrances. This also reflects the Japanese character, which I feel always carries a barbaric air, like their wide-sleeved kimonos and wooden sandals. Regarding kimonos and wooden sandals, I don't understand why Japan, which is used to embracing novelty, hasn't improved them (?). Perhaps this is like preserving those Buddhist statues, temples, and various strange customs, wanting to show that they Japanese can represent the oriental races?</p>
<p>Originally, Lao Yang wanted to take me to see Japanese Bushido dramas and dances, but I didn't want to go because I was afraid that if I went in, I would come out before finishing watching, which would be too uneconomical.</p>
<p>After the film ended, amidst the noisy and annoying sound of wooden sandals, we also walked out of the Tokiwa-za. However, the quiet and interesting streets that unfolded before my eyes were what I loved the most. These are inner streets without vehicular traffic. Above our heads was a cloth awning, and only the sound of wooden sandals echoed. The streetlights also appeared very leisurely, even though there were many pedestrians.</p>
<p>These streets have a different charm than the night markets of Harbin and are even less noisy and chaotic than the nights in Shanghai.</p>
<p>We then walked into the Silver Sparrow Cafe, which is probably like the famous cafes in Tokyo.</p>
<p>A Japanese waitress, probably only sixteen years old, came up very lively and asked us what we would like to eat. I didn't understand Japanese and didn't have the happiness (?) of conversing with her, so naturally, I had to let Lao Yang talk to her.</p>
<p>It's strange. I don't know why the Japanese use English transliterations for the names of things like oranges and apples. The word "Icecream" is also particularly strange in southern China, being half transliterated and half translated, while in the north, it is completely translated, called "bing gao" (ice cake). Perhaps "Ice Cream" is completely transliterated in Japan.</p>
<p>After we finished eating what we had ordered, we walked out of the Silver Sparrow Cafe.</p>
<p>Walking slowly, we gradually moved away from the beautiful night city and entered the dark and chaotic streets—the place where the Chinese gathered. You could easily smell the aroma of opium and hear the sounds of people arguing. I truly felt the barbarity of our civilized nation.</p>
<h3 id="e204">The Law Society Research Group of the Law School This Week <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Xin</p>
<p>No need for much introduction—readers of this publication—all know that the Law Society Research Group of the Law School is a research academic group organized by some students outside of class at the school. Their purity of purpose, openness of attitude, and intensity of work need no elaboration. Here is a brief overview of their work this week to inform those who care about the group.</p>
<p>The lecture was held in the fourth classroom. First, Ms. Jin Guangbai, the president of the group, spoke on "Freedom of Association and Individual Freedom." Next, Mr. Zhao Jianxin spoke on "The Principle of People's Livelihood and Labor Problems." Mr. Chen Anshu spoke on "The Art of Public Speaking." Mr. Fan Shoujian spoke on "The Two Major Problems in the Chinese Youth Circle Today." Due to time constraints, the topics pre-arranged by Zhang Mingjun and others could not be presented. In order to change the silent atmosphere of the meeting and the solemn and quiet taste, Ms. Jin gave a more interesting speech entitled "The Nationalist View of Love," drawing from Lin Daiyu and Jia Baoyu to what view of love we should take. Ms. Jin deeply criticized Daiyu's death as self-inflicted, as she had no courage at all... As for Daiyu's beauty, it was purely a sick beauty. Baoyu also had no bravery, he was just a white-faced scholar. In China, the so-called talented men and beautiful women often take them as representatives, and young men and women often take them as models in love. Men identify with Jia Baoyu, and women identify with Lin Daiyu. Some young men even develop lovesickness for Daiyu after reading "Dream of the Red Chamber," and young women develop lovesickness for Baoyu. It can be seen that Daiyu and Baoyu's love has become the golden rule for young people's love in China. We should actively reject and correct this erroneous concept. At the same time, Ms. Jin further elaborated on a nationalist view of love for two hours before announcing the end of the meeting.</p>
<p>The litigation practice was suspended for one week due to the monthly exam, so two sessions were held on alternating days to make up for the deficiency of the previous week. The chairman of the group, Mr. Shen Deji, is not only quite responsible for this, but he also has a considerable research background in law. Therefore, he is extremely interested in and happy to engage in the moot court practice. The drafted cases for the two practices are attached below.</p>
<p>Second Practice Draft Case</p>
<p>Zhang Shan has been without a child for many years with his wife, and in the fifth year of the Republic, he adopted Li Si's daughter from a nearby family as his adopted daughter. Last year, Zhang Shan and his wife died one after another. This year, his adopted son is fifteen years old. Zhang Hu, Zhang Shan's younger brother, obtained the consent of Li's daughter to betroth her to Wei Bing as his wife. The Li couple heard the news and expressed their opposition, arguing that when their daughter was given to Zhang Shan as his adopted daughter, after Zhang Shan died, the relationship with the adopted son was terminated. How could Zhang Hu act without authority? Therefore, they petitioned the court to determine the right to arrange the marriage and the right of guardianship. Zhang Hu argued that since Li Si gave his daughter to his brother to raise, he had long lost the parental relationship, so how could he come out and interfere? How should this case be judged?</p>
<p>Practitioners</p>
<p>Judge—Chen Gongyi</p>
<p>Prosecutor—Han Yongling</p>
<p>Clerk—Shen Jie</p>
<p>Plaintiff—Lu Zhonglin</p>

<p>Plaintiff's Lawyers—Shen Deji—Cheng Enlu</p>
<p>Defendant's Lawyers—Han Kejie—Fan Wei</p>
<p>Relevant Person—Zhang Ming</p>
<p>Third Practice Draft Case</p>
<p>Qiao Shouren of Baoshan had two sons and two daughters. The daughters were named Fengxian and Fengzhen. Fengxian married into the Wu family in Wuxing. Fengzhen married a British man named Brewster, who had become a Chinese citizen, and had been doing business in London for a long time without returning. Shouren was old and ill and died in the first month of the seventeenth year of the Republic, leaving behind more than 600,000 yuan in property, which was equally enjoyed by the two sons. Fengxian received not a penny, which was inevitably disappointing. In the eighteenth year, the detailed rules for the implementation of property inheritance for married daughters were promulgated. Fengxian hired a lawyer and sued the court to re-analyze the result. She won the case and was awarded 200,000 yuan in property. This autumn, Fengzhen returned to the country due to business and saw that her father had passed away. Therefore, she exercised her right to request a re-division based on the detailed rules as a married daughter. How should this case be judged?</p>
<p>Practitioners</p>
<p>Judge—Zhou Wenzhu</p>
<p>Prosecutor—Zhang Xibao</p>
<p>Clerk—T Tiyu</p>
<p>Plaintiff—Jin Guangmei</p>

<p>Plaintiff's Lawyers—Gu Shunliang—Xiao Zhi'ao</p>
<p>Defendant's Lawyers—Fan Zheng—Wang Shilin</p>
<p>Witnesses—Zhu Guangzu—Jiang Xingji</p>
<p>Regarding the latter draft case, Judge Zhou Wenzhu has the most senior trial qualifications, with a very calm and dignified attitude. The questions were also extremely appropriate, pressing step by step and guiding layer by layer, especially when conversing with the plaintiff Ms. Jin Guangmei. The audience listened intently, and after the court adjourned, they praised her incessantly. It is heard that in the next session, Zhou and Jin will be in opposing positions, one as the plaintiff's lawyer and one as the defendant's lawyer. When the eloquent debate begins, there will surely be a grand spectacle.</p>
<h3 id="e205">The Gala of the Wanbai Literary Society of Great China University <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— You Pei</p>
<p>Since the autumn semester began, the various literary groups of Great China University have been established one after another, and the Wanbai Literary Society, known for its reputation, has become more energetic. It is known that the society held a gala at 7:00 p.m. yesterday in classroom 301 to celebrate and invited Professor Huang Jingsi and Liu Tianyu to attend the meeting and give speeches. Ms. Li Yun, a high-achieving student of the school, attended the meeting to perform a seven-ring chime. More than 100 members of the society and Dr. Huang Jingsi and others attended the meeting one after another, and the talented and versatile Ms. Li Yun and her sister Li Yun and other women came gracefully and announced the opening of the meeting. First, Chairman Xu Zexiang gave the opening speech, stating that since the society was born this spring, its history has only been two semesters. Of course, the achievements in the past semester cannot be said to be completely satisfactory, but the Wanbai publication and the Wanbai team can contribute to all the students. It is worth congratulating all the members. Until the beginning of this semester, our members have increased to more than 100 people, and both quantity and quality have increased. We hope that the work of this semester will be more diligent than the last semester, aiming at our goals of contacting each other, studying literature and art, and promoting the national spirit. Today's conference is full of welcoming, encouraging, and amiable expressions, which can express our spirit of love and sincerity. This is also worth congratulating each other. Finally, I feel very honored to have Mr. Huang and Mr. Liu and Ms. Li Yun's presence, and I express my special thanks. Then, Mr. Huang and Mr. Liu successively gave speeches with many new ideas and encouragement. Then, Ms. Li Yun sang the Lotus Lantern, Zhang Yunxin performed Peking opera Garbage, Zhong Wenzhao performed Western music, Cheng Chunlin performed English songs, Jiang Yan performed 打漁殺家 (Killing the Fishermen), Wang Yingrong performed 太眞外傳 (The Story of Taizhen), Zong Rong performed 南陽關 (Nanyang Pass), and Fan Peiyuan performed comical sketches, skits, etc. There were more than 20 programs in total, which cannot be fully listed. It was not until about 10 o'clock that the meeting ended.</p>

<p>— By Wenzhi</p>
<p>By Gu Jianchen</p>
<p>A Three-Act Play</p>
<p>When will the life of Chinese drama become enriched? Judging by the current state, it seems a distant prospect. The general public's acceptance still wallows in clumsy performances and ugly techniques of old plays. No matter how outdated and devoid of artistic meaning these old plays are, their indulgence remains intensely interested. Moreover, drama is suspended in mid-air. How many good performances are presented to us by those who claim to strive in this field? Even in terms of quantity alone, how many people truly stand on the stage? Can we represent them with significant numbers? Since it is already so impoverished in this aspect, how can we even discuss other issues? This might be because drama in China has not received substantial stimulation, leading to its consistent decline into a crisis of stagnation. What thoughts will arise when we see such a fragmented situation?</p>
<p>We can't even discuss the artistic expression of the stage. How much power is generated by the few public performances we see in a year? However, we can't be too critical of this. While scripts may lack perfection in technical aspects due to the absence of stage technology, we must wait for good, new stages before we can have scripts that represent a new spirit and possess perfect techniques. But currently, our situation has not reached that level, and our strength is insufficient to bear this heavy burden. In many ways, it is clear that the development of our drama will see scripts precede the stage. There is already a slight tendency in this direction, and it will continue to be so in the near future. This is naturally because the advancement of scripts is less hindered than that of the stage. I believe that the sign of Chinese drama's flourishing will definitely lie in the emergence of brave and daring scripts that overthrow everything, representing a new spirit. Therefore, our most urgent task is to continue waging a defensive war for drama, promoting, explaining, and resisting to achieve a genuine understanding and acceptance from society, thereby promoting the rebirth of our stage. This surge of momentum is no accident. We need to actively start by using our strength.</p>
<p>However, when will the dawn of this new era begin? I have no obligation to answer this. It depends on the reading of the temperature gauge of our drama's atmosphere, especially the quality and quantity of scripts are prerequisites.</p>
<p>I have inadvertently discussed some issues concerning Chinese drama itself. It is true that creating dramatic art is difficult, but it is not worthwhile to be daunted by this. Now, let's talk about Mr. Gu Jianchen's "Miss Yang's Secret." I certainly don't want to say that this script will achieve any particular effect, but in today's drama scene, it can be considered a relatively good work. Mr. Gu has published two plays in recent years, one is "The Gentry Boss" and the other is "Miss Yang's Secret." "The Gentry Boss" will be introduced later. "Miss Yang's Secret" seems to have been performed before with decent results, so it seems to have received its evaluation on the stage as well.</p>
<p>The story of "Miss Yang's Secret" goes like this:</p>
<p>Zheng Lie, the newly appointed Chief of Public Security, considers his first achievement to be the implementation of a gambling ban. He believes that "it is easy to leave a bad legacy for an administrative officer in a place, but it is difficult to achieve a virtuous policy. Now that I have found such a good opportunity, it is not easy to come by, and I cannot let it go" (page 90). Therefore, he is determined to eliminate the Great China Club, a roulette gambling den. He resists the lobbying of local tyrants and evil gentry like Zhou Jize, vowing that "under my authority, I certainly cannot allow such a harmful and disruptive institution to exist for even one day." However, he does not know who the owner of this Great China Club actually is. He has not yet sorted out his own background. He does not know that the owner of the Great China Club is actually Miss Yang, his nominal sister but in reality his mother. Thus, Miss Yang's secret is revealed in this helpless situation.</p>
<p>Miss Yang understands that the situation is getting worse and worse. Amidst the battle of various confused emotions, she desperately wants to close down the Great China Club. She knows that continuing will only further wrong people, but she hopes for a peaceful solution without losing face. Moreover, she also wants to close down the Great China Club because of Zhou Jize's "relentless entanglement, which I find frightening, so I want to close down the Great China Club to avoid him using his status as a protector to harass me" (page 58). However, she ultimately fails to escape due to environmental factors.</p>
<p>At the same time, she is provoked by Jize, and she decides to deal with Zheng Lie herself, disregarding everything, wanting him to consider the past and not excessively pursue the Great China Club, leaving a way out for people to reform themselves. But as a result, she cannot directly use her own name as the owner, so she has to pretend to sympathize with the female owner of the Great China Club, using subtle words to persuade him. Naturally, she is extremely saddened by the rejection, but she still uses excuses to compare herself, constantly inserting the implication of "if it were me." Later, in uncontrollable tension, she painfully and intermittently reveals Miss Yang's background: "She is from Luoyang, Henan. She is a graduate of a women's normal school... She became a widow at the age of seventeen. Less than thirty-five days after her husband died, she gave birth to her unfortunate child, but her husband's parents had died long ago. Her husband's inheritance harmed her. Unscrupulous relatives bullied her for being weak and coveted her property, forcing her to remarry. She was alone and helpless to deal with them, so she valued her reputation and her child. She thought of various ways to escape to Shanghai, initially wanting to seek help from her classmates, unwilling to be bullied by her relatives again. She was born with a proud temper and wanted to be economically independent to support her child. Of course, the child was also brought to</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>Shanghai... for the sake of her child, she dared to take this risk. Later, she found a teaching job, but how much money could she earn teaching in a primary school in a month? The cost of living in Shanghai was so high, how could she survive? She had no choice but to accept the advice of her classmate, Miss Pan, to organize the Great China Club. She thought about working, but she couldn't do it. She knew that the available paths could not support the lives of both mother and child, so she had to follow Miss Pan to do that inhumane work. In short, she was barely surviving. She had no good way to die." Zheng Lie only bitterly cursed that woman, "Sister, you are such a noble person, you cannot be compared to her." Thus, her final decision was to leave. On the night she was preparing to leave, everything was arranged. Unexpectedly, a murder case occurred in her own home, and she was recognized by the secret agents of the Public Security Bureau and arrested together with the others. When Zheng Lie rushed over with a belly full of resentment, the deed was already done. In the end, Miss Yang left these last words: "For my son, for the love between mother and child, I have endured the pain of invisible shackles in this world, living a life of an invisible prison, and my spirit has never had a comfortable day. Now, I am free to endure the pain of visible shackles, living a life of a visible prison, and my spirit is finally much happier..." Zheng Lie only stood there dumbfounded, tearing the letter that Miss Yang had prepared for him into pieces. The tragedy ends here.</p>
<p>This play is divided into three acts. The first act depicts Zheng Lie's cousin, Jun Tao, learning that his wife, Jing Fang, has lost a lot of money at the Great China Club and scolding her, leading to a quarrel. This is where the author first plants the lead of the gambling den. The downfall of the insidious Zhou Jize is also written in this act. The author seems very clever. In the third act, he puts the story of Jun Tao and Jing Fang back in to echo each other. Moreover, the author does not inflict this shooting tragedy on Miss Yang, but adds it to Jing Fang as a kind of tense contrast. This structure is commendable. As for the author's highest point of expression, I believe it is at the end of the second act. In those dialogues, he fully includes the social issues we want to study.</p>
<p>Miss Yang: For example, when you were just in my arms, my hometown encountered a natural disaster, and my parents all died. We drifted to Shanghai. I didn't have the spirit to fight for life, and I couldn't bear the affection between siblings, so I abandoned you, or, as you said, I was determined to take you and jump into the sea. Then, would there still be a Chief of Public Security who graduated from the Department of Political Economy today? The Miss Yang had to raise her fatherless and homeless child and cultivate him to become a useful person. She had to think more about making some profit, so she took that easy path. Of course, she can be forgiven.</p>
<p>Zheng Lie: But I don't know how to forgive her. You can't compare her to your sister. My sister fought for me and society alone, without using dirty money like gambling dens to raise me and cultivate me.</p>
<p>Miss Yang: I did not use such dirty money to raise you and cultivate you. That is my happiness... Speaking of which... it's heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Zheng Lie: In order to protect their mother and child, the entire society is uneasy, and the entire society is sacrificed for them. This is the most painful thing in my hometown.</p>
<p>Miss Yang: You... must... call her... to take... her son... to jump... into the... sea... You... how can you... have... such... a cruel heart?</p>
<p>Zheng Lie: But you must also compare the advantages and disadvantages, and you cannot let major sacrifices be in the hands of small sacrifices.</p>
<p>Miss Yang: But the current world does not make everyone's life stable, which is different from forcing people not to have a stable life. If that Miss Yang could find a decent job for women, she would never be willing to take that path. Society forces her. If society has major sacrifices, society should bear this responsibility. In short, she is a good person. She is a pitiful woman, so she ended up in this tragic situation.</p>
<p>Zheng Lie: I don't want to have this view... In any case, in order to maintain a simple family for their mother and child, it is wrong to let the happiness of many families be ruined for her... It is only when people sacrifice themselves to save the entire society that many families can have true and great personalities. It is always unreasonable to let society become unstable for one person and to sacrifice the few for the many. Moreover, it is not necessarily reliable to cultivate a talent with the money sacrificed by many people.</p>
<p>If we look at these with a social perspective and analyze them fairly, will our conclusion about Miss Yang's background and actions be contempt or respect?</p>
<p>When he advises Jing Fang, how sincere are his words?</p>
<p>Fu Wuzhi: Please don't say that. Your husband also loves you deeply, so he is a little serious about exaggerating. He is full of good intentions. You can forgive him.</p>
<p>Your husband, Mr. Fu, thinks highly of you and doesn't want you to have any mistakes. His concern for you is exactly where his sincerity is expressed. He values you and respects you, so he treats your five-point fault as a ten-point fault. You don't have to be angry.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a warning to general new women?</p>
<p>In terms of thought, the author may not have been thorough, and in some places in these three acts, I cannot find the author's consistent highest point of thought. This is a pity for the author.</p>
<p>As for the artistic stage, some places show that the author's narrative technique is uneconomical, and some sentences can be reduced, while some sentences should be strengthened to make the plot more powerful. Secondly, the loose structure is also unavoidable, but this is just my personal opinion. Fortunately, it is not a play review. My main purpose is to introduce and also to dedicate to the author's intention.</p>
<p>In short, in the current impoverished drama scene, this three-act play "Miss Yang's Secret" is more worthy of reading. The author's attitude towards drama is faithful. I hope that the author will continue to work hard in the future to fulfill the pioneering responsibility for Chinese drama and express it from more powerful creations.</p>
