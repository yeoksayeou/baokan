<p>時評</p>
<h3>波蘭與西班牙之政潮</h3>
<p>近人論奧政黨。謂成立民主後十餘年來。政策之爭鬭未或稍息。結果國民所身受者。非議會政治之利。乃政黨政治不可避免之弊害。又曰政治家眼光中。有政黨而無國家。政黨祗知充實自己之實力。廣殖黨羽。蓄養個人軍隊。政爭之極。即兆内亂。其言雖似過於激切。然觀近來各國政潮。非特奧國如是。即其他各政黨政治之國。亦多有此現象。即如今日之波蘭。對德外交。正在發生惡化之時。而其國内之政黨。則專心攘奪政權。畢蘇斯基派。盡以其權力壓迫他黨。他黨乃愈起反抗。國内混亂。因之愈甚。今又聚精會神以競爭選舉。而外交之危險。有所不顧矣。西班牙之罷工風潮甫息。而今日又以坍屋傷人之故。復釀成各業總罷工。且法西邊。境謠言大起。巴西罷那亦有不靖消息。是正危機四伏之時。乃其政黨。爲舉行總選舉之故。帝制黨與急進黨。仍競爭不已。而其他種種危險。亦有所不顧矣。此外如波西兩國之祇知政爭。而不復顧及國家之損害者正多。蓋政黨之通病。以黨之利害爲先。國家之利害爲後。視黨之存亡。較國家之存亡尤爲切已。殊不知黨即以國家爲本。黨之事即國家之事。安有離國家而黨能存立者。歧而視之。此政黨之所以紛爭不已。國家之所以擾攘不寗也。</p>

<h3>坎拿大移民問題</h3>
<p>▲坎商考察團之表示</p>
<p>坎拿大政府禁止中國人民向坎拿大移民問題、近因坎拿大遠東商務考察團來滬、各界遂起而詰責、上海市商會昨晚歡宴、有人向該團提起此問題、該團當表示無權答覆、惟有請該商會擬一說帖、交該團帶去云、</p>
<h3>美使詹森返滬</h3>
<p>▲謂在京游讌甚樂</p>
<p>美使詹森赴京參加祝㨗大會後、業於昨晨返滬、據其語人、在寗游讌甚樂、現擬本月二十五日再行赴京、届時將留居二三星期、惟並無重要任務、僅欲時時至京常與國府要人覿面晤談而已、</p>
<h3>白魯士夫人展緩行期</h3>
<p>▲因天氣惡劣難於飛行</p>
<p>英國女飛行家白魯士夫人原擬昨晨離滬、直往漢城、因接天氣報告、高麗南境天氣惡劣、故已展緩行期、大約今晨或可啓程、昨日上午白夫人復往虹橋飛機塲檢視機件一次、下午五時三十分曾赴女靑年會之歡迎會、</p>
<h3>中俄商運近狀</h3>
<p>▲魚木輸入甚多　▲華船在崴待命</p>
<p>▲租輪放歸上海中俄通航以後、蘇俄商務艦隊、因俄國北部沿海州貨物、須在冬令冰凍期前裝出、轉運中國等地、故委托本埠英商賚賜洋行在上海租得中國梛威英國等船三十餘艘、開赴俄北沿海州運載海產品木材等貨、租期以半年者居多、現在俄北氣候、已經奇寒、在沿海洲運貨之租船、除留輪質堅固船齡輕幼之英船數艘外、華輪鳴鶴無恙、大興·鳳翔等各船、昨據電報、統已還海參崴、而先將挪威船海佛拉脫·皮蘭恩特·法船卡曼恩斯脫·海恩呂佛雷·及忙納司脫·等放回上海、各船均滿載俄木羊毛等貨至滬、其餘之已到海參崴者、亦有回滬之訊、</p>
<p>▲海產大批到滬俄國海產品中、以鹽魚運華爲最巨、業已多年不來、今歲兩國恢復商運後、該國沿海州產生之魚、在秋初起、始又恢復對華運銷、上海由安利等行代爲採銷、自秋至現在、經日商船與賚賜等輪裝運、此俄魚至上海者、先後十餘批、核計代價値洋二百三四十萬元、刻下暫行止裝、</p>
<p>▲木船續有裝到俄國北部森林、異常富饒、而木材之質地、又較日本與美國貨爲優、今年俄貨可以通運至滬後、木材輸入至夥、始則裝來者、以火柴桿原料居多、而近來運到者、則爲板塊、其細滑遠勝美木、刻下尙有兩儎、由忙納司脫等輪裝到、正在起卸中、聞本年尙有十餘船貨、可以運滬、</p>
<p>▲華茶待船裝俄華茶運俄去路甚巨、本年蘇俄協助社來滬恢復辦茶機關以後、即着手購買茶葉、始則辦茶磚、今則純購紅綠茶運俄矣、現在上海已購定而未起運者、尙有四萬餘箱、候海參崴船到即裝、據稱今年運俄華茶、不若上年之多、其原因（一）協助社恢復較遲、大批貨多爲英商採辦去者、（二）葉價較上年爲昻、有此兩項原因、致不能盡量購入、</p>
<p>▲正班輪猶未開英商賚賜洋行、本爲蘇俄商船之在華航輪全權代表、一切船務運輸統、由該行主持、行主馬勒、曾爲計議開闢滬崴定期班、曁恢復中俄正式航輪事、曾親到海參崴與蘇俄當局接洽、嗣後因中俄間商品貿易、尙未完全恢復、而往來旅客、又不能回復原狀、故正班輪四艘、已經擬定、而迄未實行、茲悉將俟明春解凍以後、方可實現、</p>
<h3>自來水公司查賬完畢</h3>
<p>▲正在起草報告書　▲不日即可公布</p>
<p>公共租界自來水公司、前因加價問題、引起中外市民之反對、並由納稅華人會推派委員兪希稷、何德奎等、前往調查營業賬目、以便參考、兪君等調查經月、業已將已調查之賬據查畢、即日起整理一切、起草查賬報告書、不日即可公布、關於該公司之應否加價問題、憑此報告書報告之營業損益狀况、即可决定矣、</p>
<h3>自來水加價斷水問題</h3>
<p>▲一市民之函件▲納稅會之表示</p>
<p>上海租界納稅華人會昨接市民吳斐（上海市黨部職員）君函云、敬啓者、查公共租界自來水公司、此次無理增加水費一案、經中西居民一致反對、復經貴會向該公司交涉、并聲明在該公司查賬未有結果、而認爲應行加價之前、仍依原率收取、詎該公司對貴會此種聲明、竟置之不理、鄙人亦係界内住戶（在大連灣路倍開爾路）之一、曾接到該公司以書面警告、謂限即照加價水費支付、加不依從增加繳費、則一律停止供給水料、鄙人對該案未解决以前、不能照繳、須靜候貴會交涉解决、方可辦理、夫自來水係市民生活要素之一、、不可一日或缺、租界當局旣不准市民另組第二自來公司、經營此項事業、又不准市民自取他項水料以自給、今該公司持勢壟斷此項公共事業、壓迫市民、無理增加水價、以斷水爲要挾、出此酷辣手叚、是誠扼人之咽喉、而欲取其財物、何求不遂、但揆之事理、實屬不平、事關市民切膚之痛幸祈貴會以市民利益爲前提、極力向該公司交涉、達到撤消增加水費原案、則界内市民、均將翹首以望之也、該會當即復函云、逕覆者、十一月十一日大函奉悉、關於上海自來水公司加價事、高見極佩、敝會自當依照公意積極交涉、相應函復、並希時賜敎言云、</p>
<h3>中央兌換券兌現問題</h3>
<p>▲執劵人聯合請求收回</p>
<p>國民革命軍總司令部於民十五北伐期内、呈准國民政府委托總部政務局及金庫、發行中央銀行臨時兌換券五百萬元、劵面分一元五元十元三種、劵上蓋有國民革命軍總司令部印信及政務局長金庫庫長官章、由總部制定條例公布、並布告曉諭流通市面、十足行使、該項兌換劵曾在滬上一度流通、後忽停止兌現、迭經持劵商民、向財部籲請收回、奉諭聽候整理在</p>

<h3>吳淞江水淺虞姬墩堵塞船艘</h3>
<p>本埠自入秋以來、天氣異常亢旱、以致各處河流、均感水淺非常、各鄉小浜池塘、竟致乾涸淤塞、如蘇州河（即吳淞江）原爲本埠之要道、各商船隻往來聚集之所、東達吳淞長江、西通蘇錫而至江寗、惟因滬西周家橋北新涇虞姬墩等一段、河面狹窄、每遇水淺、時有發生船隻阻塞、交通斷絶之虞、雖經濬浦局及米業輪船業等、一再會議籌欵疏濬、以利交通、奈因欵額頗鉅、迄今未克着手開工、茲緣日來天氣晴朗、各業商船往來裝運貨物、日夜踵接不絶、每遇潮汐至時、開行者尤形擁擠、昨日上午三時半許、滬西北新涇西之虞姬墩一帶、又突然發生船隻阻塞、交通完全斷絶、始則各項貨船等約有百餘艘、繼至天明後、東西兩端愈來愈多、迄至午間、竟約有八九百號之多、延長有數里之遙、其中以米船菜船爲多、即蘇錫常州及常熟蕩口等開滬之各小火輪、亦均被阻在内、乘客亦皆被困輪中、即閘北米市、米船亦頓形缺乏、聞水巡隊及該管六區一分所等、雖已派警前往、設法疏通、奈因船隻過多、一時難以調排、迄至晚間、依然阻斷、故北蘇州路老公茂招商等輪局、開往蘇錫及常熟蕩口等處之各小火輪、將售出乘客之船票、臨時一律退還、停止開行、暫停一班云</p>

<h3>一得之言</h3>
<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>▲動物之中。只有人類會紅臉。也只有人類有紅臉的原故</p>
<p>▲要變動一個女子的觀念。是一件困難的事。除非你與伊妥協。</p>
<p>▲長期的借欵。必少還的希望。牽延而難以解决的戀愛。亦輒無成功的希望。</p>
<p>▲女人們至少必有一件動人的東西。此非頭腦。亦非人格。乃是一種和愛的態度。</p>
<p>▲男子們有時讚美着一個美麗的女子。有時被一個高尙的名媛激動了心絃。然而他必須娶一個和愛的妻子。</p>
<p>▲一個女子。能以各種不同的衝動和原因。同時要上二個以上的男子。可是男子們却像舊式的留聲機一般。只能唱一張情歌唱片。他對於女子只有一個衝動和一個原因。</p>
<p>▲結婚。是男女兩性間生活上一個大過程。在這過程上。男子們停止了他對於女子的一種似對於嬰孩般的愛撫。而希望女子們以母親的態度來對他。</p>
<p>▲離婚。是愛情上的一種很有功效的外科手術。而離婚亦與外科手術一般的。須在那潔白的皮肉上留下一個疤㾗。</p>
<h3>記别開生面之情侶</h3>
<p>— 王梅璩</p>
<p>吾友終南進士裔孫有子房之美。兼子建之才。而其未婚夫人。則又詠絮之嫡系。秀外慧中。非尋常女子也。上星期日驅車往訪。室邇而人遠。案上粉紅信袋。纍纍如疊雲峯。或告之曰。此君殊奇特。未婚夫婦日煩靑鳥。傳消遞息。竟有。一日而得三訊者。余因戲而書其信面曰。「靑鳥終朝傳艷語。文鴛何日得雙棲。」見者皆笑。有一人且曰。君豈猶未知此中情况耶。越數日再往訪。相見一笑。設樽俎叙間闊。余因叩之曰。君年如此之壯矣。遲遲不成嘉禮。而第遣尺素以通詞。何也。曰吾力猶未足謀家室也。然此君雖非素封。固有恒產。且蜚聲文壇。洛陽紙貴。每月所入。亦頗不貲。其言必非由衷。乃强以酒。冀其醉後之吐露。其師高陽氏在座謂余日。此天生一對别開生面之情侶也。彼之誠欵。曾一度向余剖之。終南以目止先生。而先生不顧也。滔滔汨汨。言之無隱。此君重高尙之戀愛。寳精神之結合。詠絮者亦有同情。隔十餘日。必往胥台。一覩伊人之面。而平時緘札之密且長。雙方如一。其言曰。未婚時之情愛。如醇酒。如飴蜜。如將開未開之花。如將圓未圓之月。一經肉體之媾合。雖曰酣暢淋漓。而至矣盡矣。蔑以加矣。又且擘畫家計。撫養子女。縱愛情不生裂紋。而俗冗棼如。皆足以障碍純潔之戀愛。不如今日之不即不離。如膠如漆也。高陽旣宣其藴。終南亦稍稍露酒。儳言曰。我正寳貴此却到好處之時光。學道書中所謂情天仙侶。以相視爲陰陽。余大笑曰。然則終於此而已耶。曰不然。待至無可緩時。亦不得不爲天地作造人類之機械耳。座有狂客忽曰。此終南裔也。或於情天中闢一終南㨗徑。未可知也。終南不置辯。亦無慚色。我知其所見者眞。不可以常情論也。書之曰。别開生面之情侶。</p>
<h3>蒔菊會裏聽秋聲</h3>
<p>— 茉莉</p>
<p>上海種植園主人虞順恩先生所發起之蒔菊大會。旬日來假南京路市政廳舉行。除羅列各種名菊外。尙有虞澹涵女士發起之書畫展覧。海上各票友之會串。十二日又有臨别之程艷秋客串起解。以是轟動一時。余等入内。尙在三時。先往參觀書畫。胥近代名家之作。虞澹涵女士。近從吾鄉黃賓虹先生遊。藝事益進。所陳各品。雅逸絶倫。其他如樓辛壺之山水。馬孟容之花卉。亦各别具勝塲。而樓所作之瀑布一幅。氣韻獨厚。觀者嘖嘖稱賞。新聞報李浩然君。亦有字畫陳列。李君畫事。外間鮮見。所作亦温雅渾厚如其人。雋品也。徘徊之頃。遇友好數人。余以會名蒔菊。雖無淵明之癖。亦應略作欣賞。乃相與縱覧一週。時玉霜已來。由王曉籟君陪往書畫展覧處略一展視。玉霜本雅人。於諸名家之作。備極讚美。會有央玉霜簽名爲紀念者。一時圍觀者數十人。玉霜情不可却。勉爲一揮。觀者於其提筆之際即大聲呼好。簽名旣畢。又有呼再來一個者。至是乃爲羣衆所包圍。聞是日所簽之名。不下十餘個云。</p>
<p>玉霜旣返蒔菊會辦事處化裝。羣知登台在即。一擁而至大廳。時西門豹已成尾聲。觀衆精神爲之一振。蓋玉霜化妝已畢。須提早上塲。而女起解一劇。玉霜此遭南來。尙未演過。以是益爲人所重視。門簾内一聲苦呀。博得滿塲全釆。玉霜扮相。較平時爲美。唱則穿雲裂石。有口皆碑。固毋庸余辭費矣。惟是日時間怱促。反二簧僅唱四句。一般愛聽玉霜悲壯凄凉之曲者。苦未能饜所望。配崇公道者爲蔣勃公。尙能稱職。惟臨時增添詞句太多。然以新票友與大名角配戲。而能從容應付。亦可謂難能矣。女起解後。尙有王得天君之草橋關。余以時晏先返。恨未能一聆王君黃鐘大呂之音也。</p>
<h3>小香檳拒奬之大交涉</h3>
<p>— 心危</p>
<p>上海在春秋兩季賽馬時。購買香檳票者日見踴躍。昔時跑馬總會尙公開發售。今則漸至非會員無購券之權。今年乃更進一步。祇售號頭而不發券矣。而購買者猶爭先恐後也。Ａ字券不敷而增Ｂ字券。國人徼倖投機之心。亦與日俱增。更有一般團體。在賽馬之際。利用滬上人士之買不到大香檳者。乃發售其所謂小香檳票焉。援用Ａ字香檳得彩之號碼。而作其小香檳召號之資。中下流社會之無力購買大票者。咸改買此小香檳。小香檳三字。在上海已成爲有時間性之名詞矣。其有一號售五角者亦有一元得五號至十號者。本届秋季小香檳中。乃有發生竊票中彩拒絶領奬之交涉案。蓋有業旅館職員所組織之華洋餐務公會者。爲旅館人員公餘娛樂之機關。該會以籌集經費爲由援鐵路同人俱樂部例。亦發售小香檳。每張十號。售洋一元。券由會員推銷。奬金按全額三分之二發給。故購者頗多。有南京路外灘某大旅社之鋼琴師俄人。購得該會小香檳一紙。收藏不愼。遺落在地。而爲該社之某侍役拾取。在當時亦不知誰人所遺也。某侍役將此券。輾轉出售。爲陶某購得。該俄人失票後。曾到會報失。會中以票面載有槪不掛失例。不能補發。該俄人亦惟自認晦氣而已。不意六號香檳開奬。此二萬三千五百二十一號至三十號之一紙失券中。有二三五二三號。竟中二彩。陶某喜出望外。俄人則懊喪欲死。而餐務會不知此券尙在人手。誤爲無須給奬矣。前日陶某持券往兌奬金。而餐務會乃拒絶付欵。謂票係俄人失物。指陶之來路不明。而陶則從友人處轉購所得。信誓旦旦。以資表白。會中堅拒不付。陶乃據理力爭。引票面無憑人不憑券之字樣。且陳述來源以明其確由出價購來者。該會對此事已召集全體會員。討論應付方法。並追究俄人失票。何以能入陶某手中。而陶某則已聘請律師。向餐務會交涉。苟不再給奬。將提起控訴。以求法律之解决。刻聞此事尙無結果云。</p>
<h3>韓城之食</h3>
<p>— 天僊</p>
<p>海上菜肆。向以徽寗兩帮。最負盛名。近年以來。廣州食肆。亦蓬勃而起。蓋廣州之食。膾炙人口。其方興正未艾也。雖然。粵中食品。俱皆精美。不獨廣州爲然。韓城（即潮州）之食。亦自擅風味也。</p>
<p>本埠潮州食肆。其規模較大者。祗滿庭坊徐得興一家而已。創辦者爲一徐姓潮人。彼邦人士。都稱其肆曰「老徐仔。」而不以市招名也。所治肴核極精美適口。非若徽寗兩帮之過於油膩。而淸鮮且勝於廣州菜。惟以不宣傳故。就食者咸爲潮人。外籍人士。鮮有過其門者。</p>
<p>今太平洋菜社。特聘名廚。添設潮菜。其烹調佈置。遠勝於徐得興。故就食者無不稱美。尤以魚翅一味。最擅勝塲。其冬令應時食品。則有魚生邊爐等。風味與市上所售者逈别。紫蘭主人曾往嘗試。許爲知味云。</p>
<p>▲短訊　巴黎大戱院。近自國外運來無聲鉅片極多。均將次第放映。而現在開映者。即「美人魂「一片。該片爲烏發公司一九三Ｏ年最榮譽之出品。主角係歐洲大明星勃麗琪娣女士。劇情哀感頑艷。表演亦神化細膩。前轟動中外之「科學世界」一片。即係女士主演。繼映者。爲雷門諾伐羅主演之「飛行世界。」此片之。偉大在飛行片中。確足當空前二字。當攝製此片時。美國航空部之飛機隊。全部表演神奇技術。尙有數幕。飛機飛過大西洋時。因受狂風暴雨之阻撓。汽機炸毀。飛機跌落大洋中。種種驚心駭目之奇景。殊屬見所未見云。（伴雲）</p>
<h3>南洋游記（七五）</h3>
<p>九號晨。梁命汽車同往觀銀工塲。此僅歸彼所管之一部分也。其法先以生礦石壓碎成砂。雜以銀礦石砂三種。入火溶之。非三種合。則不能分出銀也。溶成流泥。經若干次始成銀塊。甚不易矣。此塲每日可得三十萬銀行毛收入。每年約五千萬。貲本兩千萬工人兩萬餘。華人十之一。餘多印度人。亦有緬土人。本有美人股。今全屬英。英人不過二三百人耳。華工以雲南爲多·粵人大抵爲商或木工。印人性質平和。不能與人抗。華人則有時甚激烈。英人亦不敢侮。至工價每日最少一盾又四之一。每日止作工八小時。無禮拜。因大鍋鑪一冷。須數日方可熱也。梁云。華工事事可做。惟不能創製精細者。由未受敎育也。然在此賺外人之錢。以養我民。已勝於作軍閥殺人。而取其財也。</p>
<p>下午參觀培德學校。校舍鬯朗。不收學費。訪黨部晤陳瑞穩君。</p>
<p>此間昔曾有財神廟十八處。蓋甚迷信也。梁宅懸大物件之皮一具。余視之亦驚其大。蓋與中等迴異。平常動物園中所養之虎。其躍可丈高。視其牙長三寸。粗如拇指。眞大物件也。若鄉下無槍械。緬人房屋均茅廬。一遇此大物件來訪。眞可畏也。故南洋一帶均畏此山君矣。其得名非偶然。老子曰衆人所畏。不可不畏。吾至此亦有談虎色變之經騐。蓋昔僅見動物園中小虎。故不覺可畏耳。友人告我避虎之法。曰虎性眞爽。不屑屑逐人而食。不過猛撲數次。觀於貓之捕鼠可知也。若三次撲不着。虎即棄而不顧。故諺曰老虎不吃回頭食。避虎之法。身宜轉圈。以迷其方向虎則捨之。若豹則逐人而食。不若山君之大方也。至制蛇之法。有一次一醉入晚經一井。旁人先告之曰。井旁有大蛇。不可過也。某固過之。大蛇果在焉。某乃取臥勢。仰於地。蛇即來盤之。某奮力疾滾。使蛇筋骨碎壞。因而致死。某乃倒提其蛇而返家。見者大奔。此制蛇之法也。蓋山人居山。通野物性矣。</p>
<h3>歐游通訊（八十七）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>▲巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（九）</p>
<p>當當我們跟着他走入一層一層的地窖時。一股不寒而慄的感覺陡然觸着我了。在一條窄而暗的甬道裏走。兩壁都是層層疊疊的龕室。這些龕室當時都是葬犧牲者的遺骸之所。歷歷可見的白骨現在還暴露着。在這種幽暗陰森的境界。多麽黑。多麽悽凉。多麽冷。這時候不容我自主。竟沒來由地使我害怕。忽然。我手裏的蠟燭息滅了。冷氣更在我的身上直刺。彷彿我被藏在龕内的一個骷髏釘着走。似乎很近。很近。幾乎和我相觸。在走了好十分鐘之後。仍是黑暗的窄路。一種寒氣更厲害了。兩旁的龕室更是錯綜。他們忍受黑暗。甘心犧牲。所以長眠在這裏。不。可也難說。當年他們能說話也不能說。他們的苦悶實有難言之痛。經過了窄狹而黑暗的甬道。便走進了十九世紀新發見的一個石室。裏面有可以讚美的一個祭壇。它是伏在穹頂下面的矮廳子。穹頂上畫着奇怪的花。小羊。孔雀。鴿那樣珍貴的圖畫。中有旋梯。我們從旋梯漸漸走到地面時。如同升到一個光明的天堂一樣。</p>
<p>這是初期的基督敎美術的萌芽。後來這傳統發展進化起來。就成爲羅漫克Romancsque比讓庭Byzantin峨特克Gothic諸派的建築美術。終於產出文藝復興。於是支配了千數百年的基督敎文化與藝術。</p>
<p>再過去是切切利瑪得拉墳。Cecilia　Metella立在山上展望。一望無際浸着油似的綠茵。滿生着高直的棕樹。在叢樹之間。巍然立着斷續的古羅馬的水道。古蒼的紅磚的環門。映在烈日之下。發出金紅的光輝。渲出辛辣的調子。一直延長到遠遠的地平線上而隱沒下去。在碧空中的聖保羅寺的圓頂。金碧輝煌眞是如像一個錦繡的一樣可以讚美。在這時候。你會忘却一切。眞覺得羅馬有無上的榮光。眞是永生的寳庫。</p>
<p>我在此展望了一番之後。就此驅車回去。在鬥獸塲附近的一個葡萄棚下。怱忙地吃了午餐。隨後我們就到公使館去了。</p>

<h3>北遊印象</h3>
<p>— 蘇靈</p>
<p>（二十三）獨行在大連市上</p>
<p>從老楊給我准備的一間小屋子裏走出、布烈在我眼前的是表現了中國民衆的汚濁劣性的街巷、複雜的味的集合、灰色的蕪亂的堆積、但當我走過這一段街市以後、舒展在眼前的却是一片淸新的景象、平滑而淸潔的路趣味的水住宅、綠色小樹……這是居住着日本人的聖德街、</p>
<p>在常盤橋連鎖街一帶、那裏是大連都會的中心了、雖然並沒有高樓聳聳的建築、但那些裝飾風味的街市、能於人以一種近代詩的情操、</p>
<p>於是我再穿過綠蔭的靜道、走向公園的裏面、池、亭、枯幹的架、斷木的凳、淺草、小石橋……這些、那是正適合着大袖、木屣的日本姑娘的花園、淸閑的、如隔扇子的眼睛的趣味、</p>
<p>另外一所電氣游園、也是的、布置得趣味化底小石子的曲徑、石欄橋、小坡、淺草的平原……但在這園裏却沒了很多的動物的欄囿、和禽雀水鳥的池籠、游人也比公園裏多、雖然要化五分日金、</p>
<p>而且在這園裏有一座「木魚庵」、裏面陳列了中國、日本、朝鮮的古今各種各樣的木魚、（即和尙用的法器）有四百多枚、有很大的、有極小的、極小的是一種玩具而不是和尙們用的了、有各種木料製成的、有金屬的、有玉石的、有骨角的、有甲殼的、有人造品的、</p>
<p>走出了電氣游園</p>
<p>在西崗那裏、也如我居寓的附近萬歲街那裏一樣、中國妓館林立着、在每家的門頭標着號數、這令我想起哈爾濱的和吉林的妓館了、那有趣極了、大槪是官辦的吧、特别建築了排列成圓城式的房子、在中間立一座亭閣、四面通着四個大門、這像是一座小城堡、那名稱呌「圈兒樓」、但朝鮮妓館的門口是寫什麽館、什麽樓、什麽料理、而俄國妓館却沒有標識、下等的、些妖精樣的女人會站在門外招呼你、</p>
<p>走過西崗、我上了電車回寓、等老楊從報館歸來、好准備再看一看夜的大連、</p>
<h3>黃今吾的懷舊曲</h3>
<p>— 蕭友梅</p>
<p>"In　maemorian"　Overture　本月二十三晚在大光明戲院由上海市政廳樂隊演奏</p>
<p>說起我們中國的音樂、實在是足以令我們痛心的、德國柏林音樂大學校長Kretzschmad不是說過的嗎、一國之内、就令有很好的音樂演奏藝人、但是如果沒有很好的音樂創作藝人、在國際的樂藝界裏面、到底是說不上、世界上的人士、當說起音樂來的時候、全不把我們中國放在眼中、這到底是因爲什麽緣故、</p>
<p>凡屬略爲知道天高地厚的人們、都知道音樂的創作是一件極不容易的事、祇曾學道和聲學作曲學固然是不可以說是一個作曲家、就能夠把歌辭譜成樂典、亦不可說是作曲家、爲什麽、音樂是有他的獨立生命、那末、你最好脫離文字的限制、創造成純粹的音的作品、我特斷定一句、一個不會創作樂隊作品的樂人、就令他造出不無可觀的樂歌、亦不可以說是一個完全作曲家、</p>
<p>我因爲有了這樣一個音樂創作的認識、所以我於從事音樂敎育事業之餘、不敢不致力於樂隊作品的創作、我並非是要竊取一個作曲家的名號的自娛、祗因爲我相信如果一國之内簡直沒有樂隊作品的創作、那末、誰也承認這是一國的奇恥大辱、說起來眞是的令人喪氣、十餘年來我雖然很　心國内有沒有樂隊　作產生了、但是結果終令我失望、不意今番竟得覩黃今吾君的懷舊曲、好了、我十餘年的渴望、現在變成事實了、我因是樂於把黃今吾君這部樂隊作品、介紹於一般關心音樂的邦人君子之前、</p>
<p>作者黃今吾君對我說、這是用來紀念他那個作了天上人的女友胡永馥女士的第一次樂隊作品的試作、而且亦是黃君在美國耶魯大學、學習音樂時的一種成績、這次並出美國那邊報紙上的批評給我看、報上載有黃君的照片、並說耶魯大學向例年終音樂大會時、由學生作品中選出三首最佳者加入會序、而以那個二十五歲的靑年一即是黃君一所作的爲最佳、這是一千九百二十九年五月間的事、年富力强的黃君、初次的試作旣得到這樣可貴的成績、將來的造就不是未可限量麽、現在特把黃君那部懷舊曲的結構大略分析如下、</p>
<p>此曲用小ｇ調、共分五大叚、（一）引子、（二）起叚、（三）發展段、（四）結段、（五）屋聲、全曲是由一個極簡單樂句造成、引子起時大提琴與低音提琴合奏的一個簡單而沉鬱的曲調就是全曲的線索、</p>
<p>起段的起句亦是此主要樂句化身、不過在此段中他是一激烈凄厲之調而不作沉悶之音、起段的承句轉入Ｂｂ大調、是一個很柔婉的曲、先由洋管及篳篥獨奏、加以絃樂器極輕淸的伴奏、後來絃樂器亦加入奏主調、而與管樂器作有趣的和應、起段的收句、頗含些宗敎意味、上面是一簡單的曲調由管樂器吹奏、下邊伴奏的絃樂器用琶音Pizzacato彈出很巧妙的「固定底聲」（Ground　Bass）、最後中音提琴復轉入主要樂句、同時鼓上的顫音、添了許多凄楚、</p>
<p>發展段先發揮主要樂句、經各種複雜變化、各種半音轉調後、忽轉入最響亮的Ｃ調、此時銅樂器像唱凱旋曲似的、極雄壯地吹出起段的承句來、這雄渾之調像雲開日出的那般明亮、沉雄曲後繼以嫵媚之曲、由長笛及蓽篥吹出、而佐以淸脆的信樂器的琶音伴奏、此段樂意亦起段的承句化出、於是各器互相和應、漸漸加强、以至全曲之極點、由此又漸漸轉弱、入第四段、</p>
<p>結段各節與前起段大同小異、大槪要比前略爲複雜些、譬如起句、信樂器仍奏前主句外、管樂器又本新的樂意作各種自由循環曲式的複調、在承句中、從前管樂器獨奏的、現變成爲管絃樂器對奏的循環曲了、結句中又添了一段用銅樂器吹奏、單純和絃模仿敎堂中大風琴的幾節、因此宗敎意味益加濃厚、</p>
<p>尾聲仍由原來主要樂句化出、不過現在在Ｃ大調、從前黑暗沉鬱的調頓變成光明慰藉的歌、極高音的小提琴獨奏使人想像到作者的亡友在上界高唱神曲來安慰他、而較重濁的中音提琴在兩均下作嚴格循環曲式的和應、是天上人間的酬唱了、</p>
<p>照全部結構上看來、這自然是取法模範派的一種作品、他的風味略似Brahnis、誰不知道模範派的音樂藝術、並不是最新的音樂藝術、本來自行創造出一種體製、是一件最難人的事、我知道黃君是不會因此便自滿自足的、以黃君年富力强、又有這樣不可多得的樂藝天才、經過一辛苦研求之後、定可以自行創出一種蔪新的體製、在國際的樂藝界裏面、爲我們中國奪得一些體面黃君是我國在美國大學音樂院裏面得到音樂學位的第一人、我因欽佩黃君的才學、特聘爲國立音樂專科學校敎務主任兼樂理敎授、他那部懷舊曲、因爲亦得市政廳音樂隊長Pa一的贊賞、所以特把它編入本年十一月二十三晚的公開演奏序目裏、中國人的樂隊作品這是第一次在外國人主持的上海管絃樂隊裏面得到公開演奏的機會、這豈不也是最値得一般愛國的邦人君子歡喜的一回事麽、</p>

<h3>Resolution on Important Proposals: Revitalizing Central Politics</h3>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, at its fifth general meeting this afternoon, passed a resolution on revitalizing central politics, improving the system, rectifying discipline, and establishing a center for governance to improve administrative efficiency. The full text is as follows: (A) On the reform of the central system and organization: (1) Strengthen the Central Political Council. More than two-thirds of the members of the Political Council must reside permanently in the Central Committee, and the Standing Committee should pay attention to this when revising the regulations of the Political Council. (2) Strengthen the organization of the Secretariat of the Central Political Council. All special secretaries for foreign affairs, military affairs, finance, economy, education, law, and local autonomy must be fully appointed. Special secretaries should be filled by the political vice ministers of the various ministries of the Executive Yuan. (3) Revise the provisions in the Organic Law of the National Government regarding the State Council and the Administrative Council. (4) The organization of the Executive Yuan should be changed as follows: 1. The Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Mining and Commerce should be temporarily merged into the Ministry of Industry. 2. The Ministry of Health should be merged into the Ministry of Interior. 3. The Construction Committee should focus on design and guidance for national construction and should not be listed as an administrative agency. It should be directly under the National Government. If there are model projects, they may also be designed and piloted with the approval of the National Government. 4. The organization of other ministries and commissions should be reduced as much as possible, and the number of staff should be strictly determined. This should be reviewed and decided by the Central Political Council. The number of staff in the directly affiliated agencies of the various ministries and commissions should also be reduced to save expenses. (B) On the plan to rectify discipline and revitalize politics: (1) The National Government should issue a general amnesty on New Year's Day of the 20th year of the Republic, except for the prime culprits who betrayed the Party and the nation, the incorrigibly stubborn communists, and those who have engaged in treasonous acts. Other political prisoners should be pardoned to show leniency. The Judicial Yuan should discuss the scope, submit it to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation, and present it to the National Government for execution. (2) Those who have worked hard for the revolution and have made contributions to the country and society should be commended and awarded annuities by the state. (3) The Central National Government should earnestly instruct all agencies to refrain from the bad habits of procrastination, laziness, division, and discord. They must all be encouraged to be energetic and responsible. (4) The Control Yuan should be established within a time limit to exercise its supervisory powers, and regulations for the punishment of supervisory personnel who are negligent or derelict in their duties should be established. (5) The powers of the various ministries and commissions should be clarified, and the responsibilities of the various ministries and commissions should be determined. For matters involving more than one ministry, the nature of the matter should be used to determine which ministry is the lead agency, and this should be reviewed and approved by the Central Political Council. The scope of authority for the management and operation of domestic enterprises should be clearly defined so that the operations of private enterprises can be guaranteed. (6) Examinations at all levels should be implemented within a time limit, and various laws and regulations on qualifications and selection should be strictly enforced. Each agency should submit a detailed list of staff increases and decreases, as well as the number of staff and salary, every three months to the superior agency for review. If any agency conceals the qualifications of its staff or employs personnel beyond the quota, the head of the agency should be punished. (7) Government administration should be streamlined, redundant agencies should be merged or abolished. The Central Political Council should decide on the principles, which will be implemented by the National Government at all levels. (8) An accounting office should be established within a time limit, directly under the National Government. All central agencies must prepare their agency budgets for the current fiscal year and the budgets within their scope of authority by the end of December, and local governments must do so by March of the 20th year. These should be submitted to the National Government for approval. Thereafter, the income and expenditure statements and supporting documents of each agency must be prepared and submitted for review in accordance with the law. Those who violate this will be warned or have their superiors punished. If the audit reveals expenditures that do not comply with legal procedures or evidence of fraud, the auditing agency shall submit it to the Control Yuan for handling. (9) The Legislative Yuan should enact a law on the punishment of corruption, stipulating that any official who accepts bribes or embezzles public funds in an amount of more than a certain number of yuan, and for which there is solid evidence, shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or death by the National Government through extraordinary procedures. (10) Strict regulations on the resignation and leave of political officials should be established to restrict officials from taking leave of absence at will. Penalties for absenteeism should be stipulated, and officials should be absolutely prohibited from holding positions in commercial institutions or engaging in speculative market transactions. (11) According to the central government's resolution, uniformity of accounting should be strictly enforced. No ministry or commission may, in the future, independently dispose of funds within its scope of authority in the name of special accounting. All national income and Boxer Indemnity funds, regardless of their nature, must be deposited in the Central Bank and national banks acting as the national treasury. The establishment of various banks by ministries and commissions is strictly prohibited in order to achieve unified effectiveness. (C) The shortest-term governance center and local governance guidelines: (1) The political goals for the next year should be to stabilize order and cultivate the people's strength, focusing on eliminating the greatest harms and meeting the country's most pressing needs. (2) The central governance center should be concentrated on: 1. Negatively, the work of suppressing bandits and communists, and prohibiting opium and transit dues; 2. Positively, the work of military rehabilitation and financial consolidation. Secondly, if there is remaining energy, then develop transportation and water conservancy. (3) The local governance guidelines should be focused on: 1. Eliminating bandits; 2. Surveying households; 3. Establishing Baojia; 4. Encouraging agriculture; 5. Popularizing education and rectifying academic atmosphere, and ultimately on promoting local autonomy and completing the organization of autonomy. (4) The central government should regard the eradication of communists and bandits as the most important and urgent task, and all parties, government, military, and civilians should cooperate with all their strength to complete it within three to six months. If necessary, temporary command and control agencies may be established in the areas concerned, and the methods shall be determined by the Central Political Council. The methods for dealing with communists should be formulated by the Central Political Council outside the ordinary judicial procedures, and the Legislative Yuan shall separately define them. (5) The matter of opium prohibition shall be handed over to the Political Council to formulate a special plan. (6) The abolition of transit duties and similar transportation surcharges shall be implemented on January 1 of the 20th year, and no province may request an extension for any reason. (7) The guidelines for military rehabilitation are as follows: (1) Military rehabilitation includes the following tasks, which shall be completed within six months to one year: 1. Determining the establishment and filling the number of soldiers; 2. Clearing arrears of pay; 3. Discharging and resettling the old and weak; 4. Disposing of and accommodating officers and soldiers beyond the quota; 5. Providing for the wounded and comforting the dead; 6. Rewarding and promoting officers and soldiers who have contributed in wartime; 7. Determining the soldier education and training plan and the initial national defense plan; 8. Defining the garrison area; 9. Concluding wartime agencies and clearing the costs of the counter-rebellion army; 10. Organizing and replenishing clothing and military supplies. (2) The expenses for military rehabilitation should be raised separately and should not interfere with the regular budget for political and military affairs. However, construction in other positive areas should be reduced or postponed within this one-year period, and no ministry should issue public bonds for matters under its jurisdiction. Bonds that have been issued but not yet raised should be postponed, and the Ministry of Finance should issue them uniformly. (3) The special funds raised for military rehabilitation should be managed by a military rehabilitation special fund management committee organized jointly by the central military and political organs and relevant groups. All income and expenditure shall be reported publicly. (8) Local autonomy should be promoted in accordance with the original procedures, and attention should be paid to the organization and selection of personnel in the district, township, village, and town offices, so that the outstanding elements and experienced and honest people in the local area can live in peace in their hometowns, abide by the principles of our party, and participate as much as possible in the work of local autonomy. The methods shall be formulated by the Central Training Department and the Ministry of Interior. (9) Regarding the rectification of finance, the clearing of domestic and foreign debts, and the establishment of a financial foundation, the Ministry of Finance shall formulate a plan within a time limit and report it for review.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Political Tides in Poland and Spain</h3>
<p>Recently, people have commented on Austrian political parties, saying that in the decade or so since democracy was established, policy disputes have never ceased. As a result, what the people have suffered is not the benefit of parliamentary politics, but the inevitable drawbacks of party politics. It has also been said that in the eyes of politicians, there are parties but no country. Parties only know how to strengthen their own strength, cultivate party members, and raise personal armies. The extreme of party strife is a sign of internal strife. Although these words seem overly激切, if we look at the political tides of various countries recently, it is not only Austria that is like this, but also many other countries with party politics that have this phenomenon. For example, in today's Poland, when diplomatic relations with Germany are deteriorating, the political parties in the country are focused on seizing power. The Pilsudski faction oppresses other parties with all its power. As a result, the other parties are increasingly resisting. The internal chaos is therefore becoming more and more severe. Now they are concentrating on competing in elections, and they are disregarding the dangers of diplomacy. The strike in Spain has just ended, and today, due to the collapse of a house that injured people, it has again led to a general strike in various industries. Moreover, rumors are rampant on the French-Spanish border, and there are reports of unrest in Bahia, Brazil. It is a time of crisis. However, for the sake of holding general elections, the imperial party and the radical party are still competing endlessly, and they are also disregarding other kinds of dangers. In addition, there are many other cases in Poland and Spain where they only know about political strife and no longer take into account the damage to the country. Generally, political parties put the interests of the party first and the interests of the country second. They regard the survival of the party as more important than the survival of the country. However, they do not know that the party is based on the country, and the affairs of the party are the affairs of the country. How can a party survive without the country? Looking at it separately, this is why political parties are constantly arguing and the country is constantly troubled.</p>

(2) Each section of affairs should carry out its work under unified command to avoid the situation of dividing work into power, and the separation of people caused by decentralization. (3) The appointment and distribution of staff must be able to meet the needs of reducing paperwork and focusing on practical work.

Three Standing Committee members execute resolutions, preside over daily affairs, guide various tasks, and concurrently serve as designers. They should design systematic plans according to the actual situation of the locality.

The three departments of Organization, Propaganda, and Training are all changed to sections, each with one director. They must not be concurrently held by Executive Committee members.

<h3>Regarding Party Affairs Work Proposal</h3>
<p>The Fourth Plenary Session today, at its fourth general meeting, passed the following resolution regarding party affairs work: A. Objectives of Party Affairs Work: (1) To deeply embed the foundation of the Party within various social undertakings and organizations, thereby enhancing the people's knowledge and ability to exercise their four rights and develop various social undertakings. (2) To integrate the Party's ideology with all types of educational endeavors nationwide, guiding young men and women throughout the country towards the path of the Three Principles of the People. (3) To earnestly propagate, guide, and urge local people to engage in local self-government work, thereby laying the foundation for democratic governance. B. Key Points of Party Affairs Work: (1) The Central Committee shall, in accordance with the resolutions of the Third National Congress, the "Party Affairs Implementation Plan during the Tutelage Period" resolved by the Second Plenary Session, the "Advancement of Party Affairs Work Plan" resolved by the Third Plenary Session, the "Party Affairs Work Plan during the Tutelage Period I," and other relevant laws and regulations concerning the relationship between the Party and the government, establish standards for assessing Party branches at all levels. The methods for assessment shall be formulated by the Standing Committee. (2) Party members should understand that only through faithful service to society can they truly serve the Party, and only by gaining the sympathy of society can the foundation of the Party be established. Henceforth, all comrades must no longer, as in the past, detach Party affairs from social undertakings, or even interfere with administration and justice through Party branches, causing public resentment. The aforementioned social services should particularly focus on people's schools, rural schools, libraries, etc., to promote the seven campaigns stipulated by the Central Committee. (3) Student Party members should regard diligent study and moral cultivation as their greatest obligations to the Party. Simultaneously, they should collaborate with classmates of scholarly ability and eloquence to jointly study academics and propagate ideology outside of class. (4) Party members holding positions as principals or teachers should regard guiding students to diligently study and cultivate their character as their greatest obligation to the Party. At the same time, they should also assume responsibility for guiding students' thinking, correcting reactionary ideas, and effectively connecting with colleagues to integrate the entire school into the Three Principles of the People. (5) Party members in factories should regard diligent production and increasing their skills and knowledge as their greatest obligations to the Party, and seek to participate in cooperative ventures to improve their living conditions. Simultaneously, they should connect with fellow workers and propagate ideology. (6) Party members in the business community should regard promoting domestic goods and developing industry and commerce as their greatest obligations to the Party, and endeavor to promote labor-management cooperation to increase national production, renounce speculative trading, and cultivate legitimate enterprises. Simultaneously, they should connect with fellow professionals and propagate ideology. (7) Party members in rural areas should accept the guidance of Party branches and Party-affiliated rural teachers and technicians, eliminate pests, select seeds, improve agricultural tools, increase agricultural production, transform rural life, and use these means to propagate to nearby farmers, as their greatest obligation to the Party. Simultaneously, they should focus on rural self-defense and prevent the infiltration of bandit communists. The above pertains to the positive aspects of Party affairs work. Now, concerning the negative aspects that need to be corrected, the following are listed: A. Party branches at all levels must not interfere with the acceptance or response to civil or criminal litigation cases, nor should they use mandatory official documents towards non-Party organizations. B. Party branches at all levels should appropriately reduce routine documents. (Seventeenth Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>At 12:00 noon on the 17th, a petition delegation of thirty to forty representatives from the joint associations of Jiangxi natives in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangdong, and Yangzhou arrived at the Central Party Headquarters to petition the Plenary Session. The Presidium dispatched He Yingqin to receive them. The representatives detailed the tragic situation of being victimized by bandit communists and submitted a petition. He replied that the Central Committee was deeply concerned about the bandit communist problem in Jiangxi and that, even during the urgent current war situation, it had still dispatched the two divisions of Gong Bingfan and Luo Lin to Jiangxi as reinforcements. Currently, there were eight divisions heading to Jiangxi, including those of Tan Daoyuan, Mao Bingwen, Xu Kexiang, Jiang Guangnai, and Cai Tingkai. Chairman Jiang had prepared to personally go to command after the conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session, and it was expected that Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, and other major bandit communist forces could be eliminated within three months. The responsibility of the government would not be fulfilled until the bandit communists were completely eradicated. The anti-banditry expenses, after consultation with Minister Song and others, would be exempted from Jiangxi's burden and would be entirely allocated by the Central Committee. As for the fall of Ji'an, Commander-in-Chief Jiang had dispatched personnel to investigate, and the government would certainly punish incompetent troops without any leniency.</p>
<h3>Telegram Urging Resolution of Reversionary Property in Wuhan</h3>
<p>The Presidium of the Fourth Plenary Session received a telegram from the Wuhan General Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association, stating that since the arrival of the National Revolutionary Army in Wuhan, hundreds of cases of seizing reversionary property had occurred, all based on suspicion, and remained unresolved. Consequently, the crimes of genuine traitors had not been clearly established and publicly confiscated, while innocent parties had been wrongly implicated and were unable to reclaim their property. The mortgages of various banks and businesses were even more unable to guarantee their creditor rights, and the financial situation of the market was further hindered. In the spring of the 18th year, Commander-in-Chief Jiang visited Wuhan and earnestly appealed, resulting in an order to the Hubei Provincial Government and the Hankou Municipal Government to complete the review within one month, confiscating those who should be confiscated and returning those who should be returned. The masses were grateful, but the two governments, due to caution, extended the review period. After several months, the reviewed cases were announced one by one, still awaiting central approval before being implemented. Merchants and residents had been waiting anxiously for another year, repeatedly submitting requests but receiving no resolution. The merchants and residents were ignorant and did not know why the matter had been shelved, causing genuine traitors to evade national law and innocent merchants and residents to remain in darkness. Five years of unresolved cases, with no distinction between loyal and disloyal, were certainly not the original intention of saving the country and the people. Moreover, after overcoming great difficulties, governance should prioritize leniency, and with a fresh start, everyone should be renewed. Many who were disloyal in the past were now showing loyalty, and there were many precedents of property being confiscated and then returned. If there were no signs of disloyalty, and seizures occurred during the period of establishing authority and suppressing disorder, where suspicion was prioritized, after several years of review and numerous investigations, they were still unable to receive lenient treatment, then what guarantee was there for property rights? Moreover, finance requires circulation, but mortgages could not be disposed of, making creditor rights virtually suspended. All kinds of painful situations were endured with tears and suppressed voices, making it difficult to reach the heavens. Fortunately, the esteemed assembly was opening, seeking to alleviate the people's hardships, and they dared to fulfill the responsibility of representing the merchants and residents, braving punishment, and urgently presenting their case. They earnestly requested that it be submitted to the assembly for review, to ensure that both law and sentiment were satisfied, and they awaited with gratitude. Respectfully submitted by the Wuhan General Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association.</p>
<h3>Petition Regarding Sichuan Affairs</h3>

<h3>Hamaguchi Escapes Danger</h3>
<p>Discharge of Gases Twice, Life No Longer in Danger</p>
<p>Assassin Charged with Attempted Murder, News Articles Banned from Newspaper Publication, Imminent Convocation of Parliament, Parties Busy Reorganizing Their Ranks, Government and Parties at a Loss</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Telegraph, 17th (Dentsu): There was much doubt regarding changes in Prime Minister Hamaguchi's injury. At 1:15 AM last night, he continued to fart twice, releasing a large amount of gas from his abdomen. Those nearby were overjoyed and celebrated. Secretaries Nakajima and Toda immediately notified the parliamentary group and party offices of the farting news. Worried party members cheered "Hurray!" Secretary Toda even composed a poem praising the Prime Minister's fart and opened champagne to celebrate. This was the first time there was wild jubilation since the Prime Minister entered the hospital.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Telegraph, 17th (Dentsu): After the Prime Minister farted, there is now hope for his life. His condition continued to be good today, and the Prime Minister himself is confident that he is no longer in danger. His spirits have been greatly lifted.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Telegraph, 17th (Nichiren): The assassin who shot Prime Minister Hamaguchi, Ryou Yuuki, was indicted on charges of attempted murder on the evening of the 16th. At 11:05 AM on the 17th, he was escorted from the Metropolitan Police Department to the prosecutor's office. After being detained and questioned by preliminary trial judge Akiyama, he was placed in the Ichigaya Prison in the afternoon of the same day. Due to the criminal investigation, news articles about Ryou Yuuki are banned from publication from this day forward. However, at 2:00 PM on the 17th, the ban was lifted only for the release of the assassin's name, age, address, and background by the Metropolitan Police Department as follows: Ryou Yuuki, the assassin who shot Prime Minister Hamaguchi, is 23 years old, originally from Tomisato Village, Higashisonogi District, Nagasaki Prefecture, and currently resides at the Aikoku-sha office in Nagatacho, Kojimachi Ward, Tokyo. According to the assassin's testimony, he was born in Dalazi, Jilin Province, China. After graduating from elementary school in Korea at the age of 15, he left home and lived with his mother (who had divorced his father) in Ito's home in Fukuoka Prefecture. He then worked as a sailor between Moji, Yokohama, and Kobe until the age of 19. Afterwards, he wandered around the Manchurian region for about a year. At the age of 20, he secretly sailed from Dalian to Singapore. He came to Tokyo the following year in October and lived in various places. He has been a member of the Aikoku-sha since mid-July.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Telegraph, 17th (Dentsu): With the opening of Parliament less than 40 days away, each political party is busy planning how to deal with Parliament. The Minseito Party, in particular, is facing an extremely erroneous situation in terms of its parliamentary lineup due to Prime Minister Hamaguchi's misfortune. They are currently at a loss as to who should lead the parliamentary battle. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi has not fully recovered by then, whether Interim Prime Minister Shidehara Kijuro will act as proxy to deal with it, or whether someone else will be replaced, the parliamentary lineup will change accordingly. Therefore, this is the primary question. The party leaders are quite worried about the lineup as they are at a loss as long as the Prime Minister Hamaguchi's condition is not definitely determined. They are currently remaining silent. On the other hand, the Seiyukai, faced with an absolute majority, is preparing for this three-month regular session of Parliament for the first time. They plan to have the party's elite stand at the forefront. Kishi Keisuke, the former Minister of Home Affairs, is being strongly advocated for the position of the leader of the parliamentary group. They will also select capable speakers such as Tobu, Uchida, Oguchi, Uehara, and Horikiri to raise issues such as the economic recession, the budget, supplementary plans, national defense, and other urgent issues such as measures to address rice prices and unemployment, and launch a fierce attack from the start to pressure the government.</p>

<h3>Indian Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>Work Has Already Begun</p>
<p>Nehru Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fined, Public Outrage, Major Demonstrations Held</p>
<p>▲London Telegraph, 17th (Reuters): The Indian Round Table Conference began work today. The affairs of St. James's Palace have been divided into two sections: one dedicated to procedural matters, and the other to discussing the constitution of India, whether it should be based on a central system or a federal system. Whether the meeting should be open or closed has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>▲London Telegraph, 16th (Reuters): British Indian representatives held another informal meeting at St. James's Palace yesterday. After the general assembly on the 17th, they also plan to hold another informal meeting on the 18th. The Maharaja of Baroda gave a speech at the East India Association's reception, saying that the representatives attending the Round Table Conference come from all parts of India. Although the provinces they represent, their beliefs, customs, races, and languages are not entirely the same, they are united in their determination to reach an agreement to obtain the best interests for India. This is the guarantee of India's ultimate success. The safety and greatness of the British Empire depend on listening to the Indian people to freely develop what India needs according to their talents. India should be one of the self-governing members of the British Empire. This is India's inherent right. The British should promise to proceed forward together with the Indian people who know their responsibilities with mutual trust and cooperation.</p>
<p>▲Bombay Telegraph, 17th (Reuters): The President of the All-India Congress Committee, Nehru, was arrested again on October 19th. Because Nehru had just been released from prison and gave a speech at the assembly in North Allahabad, the authorities accused him of inciting the public to destroy the salt laws and refuse to pay taxes. The case opened on October 24th. Nehru was unwilling to respond. On the 29th, the court sentenced him to two years of imprisonment, with hard labor, and a fine. In various parts of India, there is great dissatisfaction with this judgment. There are now frequent demonstrations to protest. Yesterday, Bombay police used batons to disperse demonstrators in two clashes, injuring several people and arresting many people. There was a large parade in New Delhi, which was also dispersed by the police. 218 people were arrested. In the Surat region, clashes between the public and the police injured 100 people.</p>
<h3>Spanish Labor Unrest Shows Significant Revolutionary Tinge</h3>
<p>Rumors Spread Along the French-Spanish Border, Authorities Confident of Containing the Seeds of Disorder</p>
<p>▲Madrid Telegraph, 16th (Kokumin): Following the general strike in the Spanish capital, it is now effectively surrounded by military police, and the revolutionary tinge of the labor unrest is becoming increasingly pronounced. Currently, traffic is blocked, taverns and public entertainment venues are all closed, and security forces patrol the streets wearing steel helmets. However, the workers are still able to maintain order by complying with the union's orders. The government declares that if there is any disturbance in the capital, martial law will be declared immediately.</p>
<p>▲Paris Telegraph, 16th (Kokumin): Direct communications from the Spanish capital are quite hindered due to censorship, and therefore rumors are spreading along the French-Spanish border. According to a report from Hendaye today, riots broke out in the Spanish capital this afternoon, especially in the suburbs. There are also reports of unrest in Barcelona.</p>
<p>▲Madrid Telegraph, 16th (Reuters): A strike was declared here on Saturday and Sunday, but not by everyone, nor was there any rioting. All stores, including cafes and taverns, are closed, but the vegetable market remains open, so there is no shortage of food. Crowds gathered outside bakeries to purchase bread. Only two newspapers are published and delivered by army trucks. The central railway is still running, and the city's cleaners are working as usual. Military police patrol worker-dense areas to prevent accidents. The Spanish Prime Minister stated today that the authorities have sufficient strength to deal with any possible disturbance. The government has implemented various methods to maintain a sufficient supply of food for the capital's citizens, and said that this strike is completely unreasonable.</p>
<p>▲Madrid Telegraph, 17th (Reuters): The Labor Party leader issued a declaration advising strikers to resume work no later than 5:00 PM tonight. A total of 250 people were arrested yesterday. The capital is quiet today. Soldiers are baking bread ceaselessly throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Polish General Election Held</h3>
<p>Pilsudski Faction Securely Occupies Majority, Minor Disturbances in Southwestern Provinces</p>
<p>▲Warsaw Telegraph, 17th (Kokumin): Although reports of vote counts from several districts of the Polish preliminary election have not yet arrived, the current known numbers are as follows: the Pilsudski Defiance Faction has a total of 246 seats, a much greater increase than the previous 125 seats. The right-wing opposition National Democratic Party had 37 seats in the previous session, and now has 53 seats. The leftist opposition had 175 seats in the previous session, and now only occupies 70 seats. The Marxists had 34 seats in the previous session, and now have only 25 seats. Germans have 4 seats, Jews have 10 seats, Christian Democrats have 15 seats, and the Communist Party previously occupied 7 seats, and now has only 5 seats. The total number of seats in parliament is 444. Counting the above results, only 16 seats remain, and it is unknown to whom they will belong.</p>
<p>▲Warsaw Telegraph, 16th (Kokumin): Today, general elections were held throughout Poland. The preliminary reports are as expected, and the Pilsudski faction can securely occupy a majority. However, whether they can obtain two-thirds of the 444 seats to create a dictatorial government through a major constitutional amendment is still difficult to say. The final results of the election will likely be revealed tomorrow night. According to news received from various places tonight, the country is generally peaceful. Only a few minor conflicts occurred in eastern Galicia, and there were also minor disturbances in Polish Upper Silesia.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Aborigines Still Attempting Counterattack</h3>
<p>Outnumbered and Overmatched, They Were Eventually Repelled, Japanese Aircraft Drop Leaflets to Induce Surrender</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Telegraph, 17th (Nichiren): The Ministry of Colonial Affairs received a telegram stating that at 10:10 AM on the 16th, a small team of aborigines suddenly sneaked into the forest about 300 meters in front of the Harada Unit of the Maihanbao Detachment and opened fire on our team. The Harada Unit and the Sugino Squad immediately returned fire. The aborigines retreated yelling. A second-class soldier named Shangguan was shot in the abdomen and died from his injuries.</p>
<p>▲Tokyo Telegraph, 17th (Reuters): Reports from Taiwan state that the unrest among the aborigines in central Taiwan can be said to have been quelled. The aborigines are now holding onto their last stronghold. Aircraft are dropping leaflets, urging them to surrender unconditionally.</p>
<h3>Minister Wu Gave a Radio Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Said that China Is Molting from the Medieval Period into a New Era, Continuous Unrest Is an Inevitable Stage of World Revolution</p>
<p>▲Washington Telegraph, 16th (Associated Press): Chinese Minister Dr. Wu Chao-chu stated during a radio broadcast at 2:30 PM today that China's unrest is actually the first result of nearly five simultaneous revolutions. If the same situation occurred in Western countries, such a situation would occur one after another instead of all at once, but the results of the disturbance would still be similar. China is currently molting from the medieval period and entering a new era of national life. Therefore, the nation's intellectual, economic, social, and nationalistic aspects are all undergoing great changes. Whenever there are such major changes, associated repercussions are inevitable. This can be seen in various countries. The American Revolution was not achieved until after the Civil War was settled. The French Republic took a chaotic 80 years to establish itself. It is like a baby in swaddling clothes, who is often plagued by measles, whooping cough, and other symptoms that come and go. China's situation is the same, except that all the symptoms occur at the same time and without any order.</p>
<h3>Chu Minyi Returns to China by Ship from the United States</h3>

<h3>Hurricane Causes Disaster in the Southern United States</h3>
<p>▲Mississippi Telegraph, 16th (Kokumin): The lower Mississippi River Valley was suddenly hit by a hurricane today, resulting in four deaths. Those injured have filled various hospitals. A part of Mississippi and a corner of Louisiana have both been affected.</p>
<h3>Public Telegrams</h3>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Tongguan: Received a telegram from Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Jiang Qiaocan stating that Gu Zhutong is hereby appointed concurrently as Director of the Luoyang Headquarters. In addition to the separate issuance of the appointment letter and seal, he is to comply accordingly. Upon receipt of this order, Zhutong, in addition to respectfully assuming office in Luoyang, now complies with the order to advance to Tongguan on the first day of the new year. This telegram is respectfully reported for your kind consideration. Respectfully, Gu Zhutong, Director of the Luoyang Headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.</p>
<p>To All Newspaper Offices in Kaifeng: According to a report from citizens Su Songyu and others in Yanling County, Yanling suffered the worst in this war. It was occupied in rotation by various fleeing troops such as Sun Dianying, Liu Guitang, Ren Yingqi, and Wang Zhen for more than half a year. The onerous requisitions for provisions amounted to over 240,000 yuan. The remaining forcible conscription of carts and horses and the looting of property were countless. The worst was when Wang Zhen's bandit army entered the city at night and looted wildly on April 11th during the change of guard with Liu Guitang. In the countryside, they issued tickets for ransom, affecting more than 20 villages every night. The elderly and young throughout the region were not spared. The villages such as Wangjianping and others southwest of the city suffered the longest and worst. Those who were slow to pay the ransom had their hands and feet cut off, eyes gouged out, and waists severed, resulting in hundreds of deaths. The disaster victims had nowhere to escape and had to be at their mercy. Although the bandit units have now been dealt with, the disaster victims after the looting have nothing to wear or eat. It is earnestly requested that relief be provided quickly, and that a large amount of grain be allocated and distributed to sustain the survivors and cultivate the nation's vitality. I cannot help but hope and pray. Zhang Fang, Relief Commissioner of Henan Province.</p>
<p>Important Domestic News</p>
<h3>Central Government and National Government Commemoration Week</h3>
<p>▲The Central Party Headquarters held the 86th weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at 8:00 AM on the 17th in the Grand Auditorium. All members of the Central Supervisory Committee and Central Executive Committee who attended the Fourth Plenary Session, as well as Deputy Commander Zhang Xueliang, and all officials from various departments and councils of the Central Government, participated, totaling about 600 to 700 people. After the ceremony led by Chairman Yu Youren, Li Yuying reported, stating briefly that the comrades of the Central Government had already reported on party affairs, politics, military affairs, and other major issues, which should be clear to everyone, and there was no need to repeat them. Today, he wanted to give a brief report on the chronological order of the National Revolution and the North-South unification. The revolution originated in the southwest of China and gradually extended to the southeast. The period of close relationship with the northeast was also very long. In the twelfth year of the Republic [1923], he met Comrade Zhang Hanqing [Zhang Xueliang]. He immediately recognized him as a person of outstanding talent and profound sympathy for the revolution. When the Premier was alive, he wrote a personal letter to Comrade Zhang, inviting him to work together to save the country. Comrade Zhang still keeps this letter as a memento. Later, as the revolutionary forces grew stronger and the political situation in the north changed, Comrade Zhang, due to environmental factors, was unable to make a clear statement immediately, but his attitude of sincere cooperation with the National Revolution was always tacitly understood. This is an indelible historical fact. China is vast, and in the past, there was an emphasis on the distinction between North and South, but in reality, it was only a difference in local customs and the speed of development of water conservancy and transportation. The national spirit has always been the same. Recently, Comrade Zhang has especially refuted entrenched views, eliminated prejudices, and promoted the true unification of North and South. The generals in the Northeast have all understood Comrade Zhang’s painstaking efforts to maintain peace and unification and relieve the suffering of compatriots. They followed the Premier’s teaching of "peaceful struggle to save China" and unanimously supported the Central Government, so that China, which had not been peacefully unified for twenty years or was only formally peacefully unified, could achieve permanent peace and unification, in order to calmly engage in construction and vigorously become a newly emerging country. This is the greatest good fortune for the future of the Republic of China. Therefore, the chronological order of time and space is quite remarkable. He previously visited the arsenal in Shenyang, and its scale was grand, truly the best in the country. Recently, the policy has been to prepare to convert most of the manufacturing of military equipment into production manufacturing. From this point of view, his mentality of maintaining peace can also be believed. Next, Zhang Xueliang reported briefly that he had served in the military for a long time and deeply knew the pain and suffering of the military and civilians during wartime, which was even more severe than what everyone had heard or read in writing. He recalled that once when passing through Mamuji, he saw disaster victims after the war lying all over near the train station, barely breathing, with no color on their faces. He asked why they were here and why they were displaced and not returning home. The disaster victims cried and told him that it was not that they did not want to return, but that they had no home to return to. Their wives and children were scattered, and their fields and houses were in ruins. Even if they returned, they could not make a living. At that time, he felt very sad and realized that these tragedies were all caused by the military. Everyone has a family, parents, wives, and children. Mistaken by the concept of force at one time, the people are plunged into eternal doom. What a great crime. Therefore, his outlook on life has also changed. During wartime, both sides consider each other as enemies and only know how to kill and destroy without any scruples. But those who are killed are all the brave sons of China. If this mentality is used to resist foreign aggression, how glorious it would be. Instead, compatriots kill each other, and people of the same race oppress each other, disregarding the country and the people, and willingly become criminals who destroy peace. How can they justify themselves in conscience? The source of the communist disaster was also caused by civil war. Therefore, he vowed to devote his utmost sincerity to support the Central Government and complete peaceful unification. If the goal can be achieved, he would not hesitate to grind his head to the top. Furthermore, any criticism must be based on a thorough understanding of the truth of the matter, as well as the past and the future, before it has value. It is like climbing a mountain, you must follow a certain path and climb step by step to the summit, so that you can see everything above, below, left, right, before, and behind. If you climb with artificial feet from a dangerous and narrow path, you will inevitably fall in the middle. He believes that once something is done, you should not be afraid, if you are afraid, you should not do it. You should take everything openly, etc. After the report, the meeting adjourned at 9:00 AM.</p>
<p>▲The National Government held the weekly memorial service for the late Premier Sun Yat-sen at 10:00 AM on the same day. He Yaozu, Ma Fuxiang, Jiang Menglin, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Zhu Lixue, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Zheng Hongnian, Mu Xiangyue, Wang Jiazhen, Li Jinlun, Chen Yu, Zhang Wohua, Zhu Jingnong, Zhou Yawei, Wu Siyu, Zhang Xiqian, and more than 200 officials from the National Government’s civil service and military affairs departments attended. After the ceremony led by Chairman He Yaozu, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave the following political report: "The most important thing in the country last week was of course the birthday of the late Premier Sun Yat-sen and the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session. The birthday of the late Premier was on the 12th of this month, and the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session was also on the 12th of this month. The birthday of the late Premier was the day when a new life of China sprouted, and the opening of the Fourth Plenary Session was the day when a new life of China grew. (The resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session will be reported in full after the closing ceremony.) Now that Feng and Yan have been eliminated and unification has been achieved, we can follow the late Premier’s deathbed instructions to 'peacefully struggle to save China.' The so-called peace refers not only to domestic affairs, but also to international affairs. On the one hand, we must save the country from no more wars, and on the other hand, we should take on the responsibility of maintaining permanent peace in the international community. With peace, we can actively struggle. There are two most far-reaching ways to struggle, one is spiritual, and the other is material. Spiritual struggle is to reform social psychology, and material struggle is to develop natural resources. To reform social psychology, we must first establish a moral standard, and everyone must start with themselves. If you have made mistakes, you should reflect and awaken. Then, look at the evil and corrupt forces in society and try to influence them and eliminate them. As long as the majority of people work hard on this, spiritual civilization will not be difficult to maintain. Developing natural resources is also equally important. The people's livelihoods are not affluent because natural resources have not been fully developed. But to develop natural resources, we must first lay a scientific foundation. Compared with other countries in the world, the foundation of science in our country is already far behind. Furthermore, even though science in other countries has progressed, there are countless things in the universe that should be known but are not known, and that can be used but are not used. Our country, as a country with backward science, should continue to research and explore. As long as the majority of people work hard on this, material problems will not be difficult to solve. The above-mentioned spiritual and material struggles can easily achieve results in a peaceful environment. Therefore, struggle must also take the path of peace. If we can peacefully struggle, then China can live in the 20th century without fear. Regarding foreign affairs, I have already talked about the issue of self-determination for the peoples of the Far East twice. The non-violent resistance of India has had a great impact. The British hope to resolve everything through the Round Table Conference. The Round Table Conference opened on the 12th of this month with 86 representatives, including 57 from British India, 16 from the Indian princely states, and 13 from the British Parliament. Before the official opening, there were several informal discussions. The British are very optimistic about the future of the conference, but we see that no one from the Gandhi faction has joined, and on the opening day, the Indian Catholics went on strike again to express their grief. So, even if the Round Table Conference has good results, whether the Indian issue can be resolved from then on is still unknown. The number of Taiwanese aborigines is small, and the equipment is not complete. Openly resisting powerful Japan is like an ant trying to stop a cart. The result is of course failure. But whether their lives can be improved in the future after this struggle and sacrifice depends on Japan's actions."</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Sends Troops to Block Zhu De and Mao Zedong</h3>
<p>▲Wang's Regiment Departs for Beijiang ▲Zhang's Brigade Deploys Defense in Lianhe</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The communist bandits on the border of Jiangxi and Hunan have been rampant recently. Relying on the nest of Ji'an in western Jiangxi, the large army of Jiangxi Province has gone south to suppress them, and the 19th Route Army will also open up Jiangxi. Zhu De's communist bandit force suddenly窜ed out of Lianhua, Pingxiang, intending to attack Liling, in order to resist the southward opening of the 19th Route Army. At the same time, Peng Dehuai's force, by the Jiangxi border 遂川, 折ed out of southern Hunan. On the 3rd of this month, they successively captured 茶陵 Anren counties. On the 5th, the bandits joined forces again, with the intention of disturbing Yongxing Chenzhou. It is found that there are very few stationed troops in various places in southern Hunan recently, only self-defense groups are defending, so the communist bandits can arbitrarily disturb the south. Southern Hunan and northern Guangdong Jiangjiang are adjacent to each other. In case of an emergency in Yongxing Chenzhou, Renhua of Shaozhou, Pingshi of Lechang, will be affected. Recently, a telegram from Lechang County reported the whereabouts of communist bandits, vaguely saying, "According to the report of the seat scout of Chen County, because the Jiangxi army is suppressing the communists, southern Hunan is empty. There are more than 800 gunmen and countless scattered bandits, 窜ed into 茶陵 Anren, and besieged three teams of self-defense groups. Yuwu is approaching Yongxing, Chenzhou Yizhang is shocked. In addition to supervising the county police team to strictly guard against it, I respectfully telegram to ask to send a team to be stationed in the places such as Jiufeng Pingshi Tangcun of the county, in order to block and consolidate the frontier. County magistrate Liu Yunfeng knocked at the Wu Yin seal." Also, the Pingshi Chamber of Commerce 电称, "缅麕 According to a telegram from Yizhang, Jiangxi bandits 窜ed from Lianhua into 茶陵 Anren counties, Chen Yizhang is in danger, the defense army in southern Hunan is thin, and the people in Le Ping are extremely panicked. I beg you to send heavy troops quickly to be stationed on the border of Hunan, in order to鎭慑. Urgently awaiting orders, Pingshi Chamber of Commerce knocked at Yu," The authorities have reported that they have sent all kinds of troops to northern Guangdong for deployment. Wang Dinghua's independent regiment has been transported from the North Sea to the province, and will immediately transfer to Beijiang, together with the local defense army's third regiment Deng Hui, to assist in the defense of Renhua Lechang Pingshi. Longnan, on the Jiangxi border, and the northeast of Guangdong, are adjacent to each other. For prevention, the authorities have also telegraphed to the Xiang Hanping division Zhang Da brigade stationed in Dongjiang to open to Lianping Heping from the border of Guangdong and Fujian, to block Jiangxi Communist bandits from 窜ing Guangdong from 寻邬 Longnan 虔nan and other places. At present, the Jiangxi army has gone south along Ji'an, and the 19th Route Army will also move forward to Pingxiang. The fourth route He Jian department then used two divisions to rush out of 茶陵 Anren from Hengzhou. The self-defense groups in the southern Hunan area gathered in Chen Yi and went north to Yongxing. The Wang Deng regiments in northern Guangdong then deployed defenses in Renhua Rucheng, and the northeast was divided by the Xiangshi Zhang brigade to defend Lianhe. It is expected that this time the three provinces will join forces to suppress the Communist bandits in Jiangxi and Hunan, and it will not be difficult to 평定 them in one go. (November 13)</p>
<h3>Gao Weiguo Burns and Plunders Dongyuan Township</h3>
<p>▲The Quanzhou People's League Jointly Resists Gao</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence, Gao Weiguo, the former guerrilla brigade stationed in Quanzhou and transferred to Huian, was originally a famous bandit in Quanzhou. He was收抚 by Lin Shouguo, the second brigade of the Marine Corps, and编为 the Navy Guerrilla Brigade, and then改隶 the provincial government. In the summer of this year, the 56th Division was transferred to the province, and Gao's department took over the defense of Quanzhou. The people's团 of Jinjiang Nan'an counties once联合驱高, and then the provincial government调防 Gao's department to Huian. The Huian people also suffered after Gao驻惠. At the beginning of this month, Gao Weiguo sent his ministry to Lin Jianwu Gao Yang鑼营 to 开驻 Dongyuan of Huishou. On the 7th, he first sent people to Dongyuan to find the address of the驻兵. The people of Dongyuan Township refused because Gao's department's discipline was too bad, and the two sides had a conflict. At 8:00 a.m. on the 8th, Gao sent Lin Gao's two ministries of 500-600 people to attack Dongyuan in three ways. One entered Shamuyu from Xingtian, one entered Linkou from Shanggang, and one entered Wuqi Mountain from Changxiang厝. The people's regiments of each township gathered teams to resist. From 8:00 a.m. on Shangxiang, the fierce battle continued until 3:00 p.m. The Linkou People's League retired due to the exhaustion of ammunition and was attacked by Gao's troops, killing and plundering, and burning 13 houses. At the same time, the Shamuyu road was also invincible, and Dongyuan fell. On the night of the 8th, the Luo Sun two surnames' people's teams rushed to help and counterattacked Dongyuan.

<p>The school principal was stripped of his clothes and robbed. Ding Tiejun, the principal of the fourth central elementary school in Qian'an, lived in Lvhetan and habitually returned home in the evening. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, when he was returning home from school, he suddenly encountered more than 30 bandits, holding six rifles, two box guns, iron rulers and wooden sticks. They grabbed Tiejun, stripped off his clothes, top hat, leather shoes, and robbed him of forty-eight yuan in cash and banknotes, as well as his briefcase. His glasses were also smashed. They tied his hands tightly with hemp rope and dragged him to Chen Wenjun's house at the east end of Qian'an (only one mile away from Qian'an) to rob. First, they attacked the front and back doors, but they were unbreakable, so they entered through the stove window. Tiejun was tied to the bed, and then all of Chen's valuables were robbed. The doors and windows were also smashed. Fortunately, the family had already escaped, so there was no harm. Only one person was seriously injured by the bandits, and it is unknown whether there is any danger. After the robbery, the bandits released Tiejun. Tiejun was quite cold, so he put on the broken quilt left behind and returned.</p>

<p>Strictly implement the National Calendar holiday for elementary schools. Since the National Government ordered the implementation of the National Calendar, all sectors should abide by it consistently. The Education Bureau believes that schools are the object of public attention, and holidays should be absolutely observed in accordance with the Education Department's instructions. Fearing that the elementary schools in the countryside, accustomed to old habits, might be insincere, it was decided at yesterday's bureau meeting that, in addition to ordering all education committees to comply, special personnel should be sent to inspect the situation in various places. The National Calendar holiday is three weeks, and the lunar calendar should not be given a holiday.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The detective team arrested suspected bandits who robbed a boat. Sun Renfu's night boat between Suzhou and Guangfu was intercepted and robbed by bandits at about 3:00 a.m. on the 8th of this month when it was sailing to Dongkuatang. More than 400 yuan in cash was robbed. Afterwards, the victim reported to the Public Security Bureau for arrest. After the bandits obtained the property, due to uneven distribution of the loot, three bandits, Yang Jigen, Liu Xingxing, and Zhang Jiaxiang, met Zhou Hongjiang, the captain of the detective team of the Public Security Bureau, on the road outside Chanmen on the evening of the 15th. They went forward to surrender and reported that the bandits were hiding in a village house near Xintang Bridge behind Huqiu. After receiving the report, Captain Zhou lured them to open room 19 in the Zhonghua Hotel, and separately reported to the Public Security Bureau and summoned many detectives from the entire team. At about 1:00 a.m. that night, they drove to Huqiu with Wang Du, a patrol officer from the free car team.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>The winter defense district chief builds three conferences. The county government of this county opened a winter defense meeting yesterday morning. The district chiefs of each district and the captains of the water and land public security teams attended. County Magistrate Tan presided over the meeting. The decided items are summarized as follows. Regarding joint defense matters, it was decided to divide the county's 15 districts into six major joint defense districts. Each district will have one director and several deputy directors, and temporary military telephones will be set up to receive news and facilitate defense. Unemployed guests and vagrants will be ordered by the public security sub-bureaus and outposts to strictly ban their comings and goings, and residents will be prohibited from retaining them. The meeting ended at 12:00 noon. In the afternoon, district chiefs' meetings and fundraising closure meetings for the construction of prisons were held. At the district chiefs' meeting, the decided items included, as proposed by the first district chief, whether the activity funds for the district branch should be deducted from the district financial management office. The result was that the county government would submit a request to the Civil Affairs Department for verification and approval. The fundraising for the construction of the prison has now ended, and the results are quite good, reaching more than 6,000 yuan. In the future, for construction matters, a Changshu County Prison Construction Committee will be organized, and nine committee members will be appointed: Qu Junyi, Chen Qiwei, Xu Jingxi, Qu Liangshi, Hao Bingzhang, Wu Zhongying, Xu Juntan, Wu Xinheng, and County Magistrate Tan. The base will use one and a half mu of land from Daonan Company in accordance with the Land Acquisition Law of the National Government, and will be submitted to the county government meeting for deliberation.</p>
<p>The peanut boat in Fushantang was robbed. A Jiangbei guest Shi, who specializes in selling peanuts, came to Changshu the day before yesterday to sell peanuts. After selling the goods, he calculated that he had more than 600 yuan in cash. For the convenience of hiding, he went to the Transportation Bank to exchange banknotes, and then set sail from Changshu to return to his native Jiangbei. Unexpectedly, Shi was侦知 by bandits when he sold the goods and when the boat arrived at Xieqiao, it was already dark and he could not travel. Shi and others rested there. At 4:00 a.m. the next morning, the sky was still not bright. Due to the tide, Shi and others drove the boat to start. Unexpectedly, after passing Chenjiaqiao, the place was 冷僻. Three bandits shouted to stop the boat on the shore, and they had to wait for inspection. Shi and others saw that they were inspectors and did not suspect anything else, so they leaned on the shore. The three bandits jumped on the boat and searched the entire boat, each with a box gun. As a result, more than 600 yuan in goods was robbed and escaped ashore.</p>
<p>There are doubts about the giant extortion of associates in Huahang. Chen Mingkui, an associate of the Yu Kang Cotton Shop in Hejia City, came to the city and withdrew a huge amount of 17,500 yuan from the Bank of China. The case of being robbed on the way was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after Chen Ziyoucheng withdrew the money, he put the banknotes in a rattan basket and took the Zhitang ship back to his hometown. After paying 100 yuan at the tax card, he walked back to Hejia City. When he arrived at Zhudian Bridge, he met four bandits. Two bandits robbed Chen's rattan basket first, and two bandits pushed Chen from the bridge to the river. He was rescued by someone, but the bandits had gone far and could not be traced. Chen Na淋漓 went to the He City Xingzhong and reported to the manager, and then转报 the armed forces to pursue the bandits. However, according to the villagers from Zhitang, the headquarters of the Yu Kang Flower Shop is located in Wuxi. Every autumn, they must come to Changshu Wujiang to collect cotton. Chen Mingkui is indeed an old friend of the company with a good reputation. There are many suspicions about this giant extortion: (1) Since the robbers extorted his money, why did they push him into the river again? (2) The ship can reach a certain place three miles away from He City, but Chen Deng'an on the more distant Zhitang, although there is a tax card relationship, but you can also go to Xinghou and then pay again. (3) The area is heavily defended, and cases of robbery are rare. All of the above are speculations from the villagers. Now, due to the importance of this case, the defense agency has sent various teams to the countryside to investigate.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Public Security Bureau divides the Wuxi area into five police districts. In the past, there were 17 cities and towns in Wuxi, and later they were changed to 17 autonomous regions. The entire county's public security sub-bureaus have the largest number in the first district, with six sub-bureaus. The remaining 16 cities and towns have only ten sub-bureaus. The establishment has not been widespread, so the districts that have not established sub-bureaus have not been covered by each other, and there is a feeling of neglect in terms of security jurisdiction. Xu Jigui, director of the Public Security Bureau, was keenly aware of this and specifically brought this matter up at the sixth bureau meeting. It was decided to divide the county's public security sub-bureaus into five districts, with one sub-bureau in one district as the principle. Depending on where the sub-bureau is located, the district will be the directly managed area. The adjacent districts that have not established sub-bureaus will be temporarily assigned to the nearby sub-bureau for co-management. After the sub-bureau is established in the district in the future, it will be returned. Yesterday, the descriptive text of the division of police districts was submitted to the county government for approval and record.</p>
<p>Expel the inferior monk from Xilin Temple. There is a Xilin Temple outside Ximen Bridge, welcome to Dragon Bridge. The abbot of the temple, Monk Canxia, is originally from Jiangbei. He is lewd in nature, does not abide by Qing regulations, and organizes a lotus society in the temple to seduce young men and women, promote superstition, collect money and confuse the public. Recently, he has been blinded by greed and has occupied the old five-hole bridge bridge alley near the place, colluding with his fellow villagers to build grass sheds, obstruct pedestrians, and hinder traffic. The people in the area, You Houqing, Wen Jinxian, Zhang Tong, etc., believe that the monk's behavior is illegal, so yesterday they jointly submitted a letter to the county government with 44 merchants such as Hongtai in the area, requesting that the adulterous monk Canxia of the temple be expelled from the country as soon as possible and another abbot be recruited.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Jiangyin's autumn harvest is fully levied according to the amount. Most of the counties in Jiangnan have had bumper harvests this year. Jiangyin did not report any disasters, and the autumn harvest should be fully levied according to the amount. Yesterday, Director Shen of the Finance Bureau reported the detailed numbers of the silver and rice actually levied this year to the Finance Department, totaling 985,592 mu, 2 li, and 8 hao of real flat fields, and the amount of upper and lower busy silver was converted into 213,245 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 li, 5 hao. The amount of Cao rice was converted into 380,269 yuan, 5 jiao, and 4 li, 6 hao.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Strictly arrest the wanted criminals in the Zhaoyang Cao malpractice case. The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in the case of Zhou Bisen and Wang Lingping reporting the loss of Cao grain in the previous year's Liyang bandit chaos, Zhang Quan, Zheng Chengyuan, the former county magistrate, and various party and government agencies in the county all colluded to commit fraud and share the spoils. Previously, personnel were dispatched to conduct a thorough investigation and successively transferred 11 people, including Zheng Chengyuan, the county magistrate, and Pan Bin, the director of the Finance Bureau, to the province for interrogation. All of them were suspected of serious crimes and have been transferred to the Zhenjiang District Court for legal interrogation. There are still important criminals in the case, including Zhang Quan, the former county magistrate of Liyang, Cheng Linshen, the former director of land tax, and Zou Hanliang, the former section chief of the finance bureau, who have not yet been arrested. Therefore, yesterday, the Civil Affairs Department was specifically instructed to transfer the order to its subordinates to strictly arrest them all and bring them to justice for investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Conspiring to Seduce and Abscond with Funds: Outside the city's customs gate, there was a farmer named Chen Tingkui, who had a daughter named Xiao Bianzi. She had been betrothed to a son of the Wang family. Some time ago, Chen went to the town on business. A shop assistant named Yin Zhengliu, working in a clothing store next door, took advantage of Chen's absence. He conspired with a friend named Xiong to seduce Chen's daughter and abscond with funds. Unexpectedly, they were spotted halfway by a neighbor named Jin Yusheng. After Chen returned home, Jin immediately informed him of the situation. Thereupon, Chen immediately apprehended Yin Zhengliu and handed him over to the local former Baojia head for custody. Subsequently, Yin requested Sheng Yuhuai to intercede, promising to hand over the person the next day. However, he failed to fulfill his promise. Chen, having no resolution, then sued Yin and others at the local Public Security First Branch for conspiring to seduce and abscond with funds. It is said that after the branch received the complaint, it considered the case related to judicial matters and inconvenient to handle, and instructed him to directly file a lawsuit with the court.</p>
<p>Aircraft to Arrive in Yangzhou Soon: The airfield established outside the East Gate of this city, according to orders, is now ready.

Fortunately, the Magistrate heard the news and fled, avoiding disaster. However, the area has been devastated. They requested that the telegram be forwarded to the Salt Affairs Bureau, requesting the dispatch of a large force to suppress the bandits. Yesterday (the 15th), the telegram was forwarded to the Salt Affairs Bureau, and the Huainan Anti-Smuggling Bureau was ordered to suppress the bandits.</p>

Yesterday morning (the 14th), he went to visit the Director of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau, presenting the previous reasons and requesting instructions on how to handle the situation.</p>
<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Firefight Between Sea Bandits: It is said that the Haigang sea bandits have long been divided into two factions, the Southern faction led by Pan Kaiwu and others, and the Northern faction led by Shen Guanxi and others, who have been harassing the coastal areas. Last autumn, Shen was recruited by Ma Yuren and led his troops to participate in the harassment of Yancheng and Funing. After the failure, he again led his troops south to the ports in the area. Unexpectedly, Shayutingzi had been seized by the Southern faction, Pan Kaiwu, and others. Shen, feeling that he had been deprived of his territory, was unwilling to give up. He led his men to attack Pan's bandits, sinking as many as nine of Pan's ships with artillery fire. Pan led his ships to retreat from the port. The day before yesterday morning, Pan suddenly commanded a large number of followers, leading more than 30 ships, and attacked Shen's troops again. Shen's bandits could not resist and gave up the port again. The port's terrain is advantageous and has long been occupied by them. The current firefight is due to this reason. It is said that the fighting between the two sides was quite fierce and the losses were great.</p>

He came to the town to take a bath at 4 PM today (the 11th). While passing in front of the Public Security Bureau, he suddenly encountered five soldiers from an unknown team, armed with rifles and Mauser pistols, escorting two rickshaws, each carrying someone resembling a farmer. They ordered him to pull the rickshaws. After traveling less than a mile, Miao Wenlin ran away in an attempt to escape. The soldiers followed and fired a shot from a Mauser pistol, hitting Miao Wenlin in the head. He fell to the ground, his brains splattered out, a tragic sight. The deceased's family rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, wailing and crying. The Public Security Bureau and the District Defense Corps of this town heard the news and pursued them, but the perpetrators had already escaped without a trace.</p>

<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Spreading in the Western Countryside: The banditry in the Changxing area of the western countryside of Huzhou has been rampant recently, surpassing other places. Kidnappings and robberies are heard every day. In Yangjiaqiao, about nine miles from the Dadongmen of Changxing, there was a farmer named Yang Adong, who was engaged in farming and had considerable property. At about 8 PM on the afternoon of the 12th of this month, suddenly a dozen or so bandits came, each holding a wooden-cased gun, suddenly arriving at his house, breaking down the door and entering, overturning boxes and cabinets, searching at will, looting all the silver dollars and valuables, and kidnapping Adong's son, leaving a letter demanding a large sum of money.

<h3>Declaration of the Seventh District Party Department on the China Public School Incident</h3>
<p>▲ Students Suddenly Expel Ding Kouyin</p>
<p>(National News Agency) The Seventh District Party Department declared on the China Public School incident, saying, At the time when the military is pacifying and the central government is planning reconstruction, all sectors of the people should strive for the development of their careers to save China, which is in danger. However, in recent days, student movements have repeatedly occurred in schools in Beijing and Shanghai, which does not seem to be the hope for the future of construction. Among the student movements, the China Public School is the most prominent. The reason for this is that those responsible have failed to patiently guide the young students to the correct path of the Three Principles of the People and have provoked and instigated them afterward, leading to repeated disputes and delays. Since Hu Shi took over as president of the China Public School, erroneous theories and heresies have emerged one after another, defaming the Premier and sparing no effort. After criticism from our party comrades, he left the school. He was succeeded by Ma Junwu, who, in order to consolidate his position, did not hesitate to protect reactionary elements, colluding with them and using the hot-blooded youth to control the student union and rape the will of all the students. After being pointed out by social figures, he resigned and left the school. The board of directors, out of love for the China Public School, could not bear to sit idly by, so they urged Mr. Yu Youren to maintain it. Anyone with a little conscience should unanimously support and sincerely welcome it. Who knew that Hu Shi and others would cause trouble, instigate the movement, and their vicious intentions are evident here. The comrades in this district, not wanting to sit idly by, specially spoke out righteously. On the one hand, they hope that Wang Gong will continue to take responsibility, and on the other hand, they warn Hu Shi not to be a scourge of society. They hope that the youth will work hard at their studies at this time of construction and talent need to complete the Premier's will. This is the declaration.</p>
<p>A letter from the students of China Public School to the board of directors said,</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, It is said that the rise and fall of a school depends entirely on the president. Since Mr. Ma Junwu took office as president of our school, he has worked tirelessly day and night, striving for the school's administration, so the school's affairs have developed vigorously, and all the students are cheering and celebrating each other. Unexpectedly, owls are lurking, and villains are taking the opportunity to reverse right and wrong, causing the board of directors to approve President Ma's resignation. The rights and wrongs of which all the students have issued a declaration, which will not be repeated here. We believe that you are a famous elder in the country and a mentor to the youth, and you have a special enthusiasm for protecting our school. We dare to hope that you will follow the feelings of the people below and promptly facilitate the board of directors meeting, take back the order to approve President Ma's resignation, and severely punish the ringleaders who disrupted the school to quell the public's anger. The current movement was purely instigated by Ding Kouyin alone. Ding's poor performance in the school has long been notorious and has long offended the public. The students did not criticize him in order to give him a way to reform, but unexpectedly, he has not repented, reversing black and white, and deliberately plotting to overthrow President Ma to achieve his own selfish goals. Sima Zhao's heart is known to everyone. With your great personality, you will definitely not want to associate with Ding. Moreover, if Qingfu is not removed, the troubles in Lu will not end. If Ding exists, our school will never have peace. Please, in the board of directors meeting, be motivated by justice and propose to revoke the order to approve President Ma's resignation. This will not only be grateful to all the students, but also greatly benefit the future of education.</p>

<p>The battle between Youai and Fushi was the opening act of this tournament. Fushi led with a neat lineup. Youai resisted repeatedly, but still found it difficult to escape the danger. They were behind 10 to 14 in the first half. The situation tightened in the second half. Youai used their lively bodies and agile passing, and progressed step by step. In the last five minutes, relying on Zheng Zhifang's goal, they jumped to the forefront with a score of 16 to 15. Fushi's ambition was still there, and they continued to fight. Soon, Ren Tongyao scored a goal, leading by another point. At this time, the two sides were at a critical moment of life and death, and they all dealt with it with all their attention. Then, Youai's luck was high, and Wan Ruiding was seen shooting a goal, resulting in Youai winning 19 to 18. Referee Fu Hua.</p>

In the first half, Summer Light scored seventeen points, while Jewish scored two. In the second half, Summer Light's forwards were even more active on the inside, and Jewish was completely defeated, beyond recovery. As a result, Summer Light defeated Jewish with a score of 50 to 8. The referee was Fuhua.</p>

<h3>▲West Youth Wins Against Labor University (Group A)</h3>
<p>▲Two Teams' Strength There are two teams from West Youth participating in the competition, distinguished not by A and B, but by "Thief" and another name, which is also a good story. The one that played last night was the West Youth "Thief" team, whose strength is stronger than the other. The Labor University basketball team rarely interacts with the outside world, and few know their skills. Last night's first performance, although restricted by the strong and stubborn West Youth, still managed to display their talent. There is great hope for the future.</p>
<p>▲Course of the Battle The Labor University players are tall and strong, able to compete with West Youth on equal footing. Once they met, they almost forced West Youth near the basket. Smith scored the first point, after two minutes of fierce fighting, showing how urgent their defense was. Afterwards, Yang Shujing from Labor University scored a free throw point, and soon Siguia also made a free throw. The three forwards from Labor University broke through the enemy lines, and Song Jinhai threw the ball in, tying the score at 3-3. West Youth's formation was scattered, so they requested a timeout and changed their lineup, replacing Han Enshi and Sha Liven with Polas and Bi Lai. The effect was indeed significant. Labor University's solid defense was repeatedly broken, and Smith and Siguia were very active. In the first half, West Youth scored 22 points, and Labor University scored 3 points. In the second half, with the help of their teammates, Labor University's Guo Cengwang, Yang Shujing, Liu Ruisheng, etc., made contributions in foreign territory, but it was short-lived. They were then suppressed by West Youth and could not extricate themselves. In the end, they lost with a score of 11 to 41. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Women's Table Tennis Team Reorganization and Expansion</h3>

Talented players such as Ma Baokun, Lin Muzhao, Zheng Lihua, Li Ruifen, Feng Xiaoji, Wei Peiyun, Lin Ruyi, Lin Murong, Zhang Runzhu, Chen Yongbao, Li Guilian, etc., are outstanding table tennis talents gathered from Shanghai's Liangjiang Women's Physical Education College, Fudan University, Guangdong Middle School, Qixiu Girls' School, and Guangzhao Girls' School. Instructor Zeng Rongzong and others are enthusiastic in sports and dedicated to service, and have made many contributions. Previously, due to busy schoolwork, they had no time to take care of both, and resigned more than three months ago. The team's work has been affected. The team believes that Mr. Zeng's schoolwork is now less busy, and specially sent a letter to retain him as the instructor. Mr. Zeng, considering the promotion of women's table tennis, has replied and agreed to take time out of his busy schedule to work. He has already discussed the new plans for this term with advisor Yu Binqi yesterday. It is planned to hold a friendly match with the rising Feifei Women's Table Tennis Team at the Jiande Hall on Fusheng Road next Sunday. The fourth session of the team's staff has elected Lin Muzhao as the captain, Zheng Lihua as the secretary, Feng Xiaoji as the treasurer, and Zhang Runzhu as the recorder. The team is now widely recruiting comrades for the purpose of popularizing women's table tennis. Those who are interested in studying table tennis are very welcome. The registration and contact time is set every Sunday, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM. Address: No. 13, Sanyuanli, Dongqiu River Road.</p>

<h3>Record of the Canadian Business Delegation's Inspection Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Tour of the City in the Morning ▲Visit to Factories in the Afternoon ▲Luncheon at the British Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>▲Welcome by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:00 PM ▲Arrival at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 7:00 PM ▲Guests and Hosts Exchanging Speeches</p>
<p>The Canadian Far East Business Delegation arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and was warmly welcomed by all sectors. Yesterday morning, all members of the delegation took cars to tour Shanghai city for a week. At 12:00 noon, they attended a luncheon hosted by the British Chamber of Commerce. After 1:00 PM, they visited major factories. At 4:00 PM, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce held a tea party at Chen's residence, No. 6 Seymour Road, to welcome them. At 7:00 PM in the evening, they attended a banquet hosted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. It was also decided that they would continue to visit major factories in the city this morning, attend a luncheon hosted by the Pan-Pacific Association at 12:00 noon, and take a ship to Hong Kong at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, with a planned stay of two weeks before returning home. The situation yesterday is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲Reception by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce The Municipal Chamber of Commerce hosted a public banquet for the Canadian Business Delegation to China last night. Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered a speech as follows: Gentlemen of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce Business Delegation, this time you have come from afar, first to Japan, then to China, for a large-scale commercial inspection. In the history of Sino-Canadian trade, this seems to be the first time. My colleagues at the Chamber of Commerce, as the hosts, are extremely welcoming, and we have two feelings about the arrival of these distinguished guests: (1) It is sufficient to prove the drastic changes in the world economy after the European War. Whether it is a country with a small land and a dense population, or a country with abundant products and extremely advantageous geographical conditions, it must open up new markets overseas in order to solve the problem of overproduction and the problem of worker unemployment to a considerable extent. (2) To feel the importance of China and Japan on the Pacific Ocean to the world economy, and comparing the situations of China and Japan one by one, it seems that China is more important to the world economic relationship than Japan. Because, first, China's 400 million population, if its purchasing power is properly developed, is no less than a ratio of 7 to 1 compared to Japan's 60 million population. Secondly, Japan is now an industrial country, and its products are spread all over the world market, with the possibility of competing for hegemony. China, on the other hand, is in the construction era and lacks raw materials and industrial products, which are more needed than any other country. It welcomes the assistance of friendly countries in terms of materials. But if any country in the world can give the Chinese people a friendly attitude and sincere sympathy, then China is willing to recognize it as a mutually beneficial country at any time and quickly abandon narrow-minded views on race. Therefore, my colleagues at the Chamber of Commerce would like to tell you, gentlemen, with a straightforward view that China is the only country in the world that can truly implement the open-door policy, and China is also the only country that can implement economic mutual assistance. Even in terms of the world's current tariff system, almost all countries use tariff policies as a barrier to protect industry. However, since the abolition of the tariff agreement system in China, its revised import tariff rate still maintains an extremely fair and tolerant policy. This advantage is also unique in the world. Therefore, my Chamber of Commerce sincerely hopes that you, the delegation, must first recognize China's position in the world economy, which is more important than that of Japan, in order to achieve the purpose of this visit to China. After recognizing the importance of China's position in the world economy, the second step is to implement the four characters of economic mutual assistance, correct the mistakes of the past history of China and Canada, so as to win the sincere sympathy of the Chinese people and make the commerce between the two countries flourish day by day. There is an old saying in our country: "Those who love others are always loved by others, and those who respect others are always respected by others." It also says, "It is impolite to go without coming, and it is impolite to come without going." My Chamber of Commerce uses these two sentences as an explanation of economic mutual assistance, and I feel that it is still appropriate. The current situation in your country is not comparable to the initial development of industry in the past. There is no need to recruit Chinese workers, and our country's workers do not hope to continue to enter the country. However, my Chamber of Commerce dares to represent the people of the whole country and put forward the fairest and most frank request, which has two main points: (1) For the people of China and Japan entering the country, they should be treated equally, and no special immigration regulations should be set up for China. (2) Since the trade relations between the two countries have not been interrupted, the hub for trade is actually the merchant. Merchants should be absolutely free to come and go. In terms of the principle of equal national relations, merchants from your country who come to our country to do business are not restricted by the amount of capital or the number of years of operation. However, your country restricts our country's merchants from importing unless they have a capital of more than 2,500 Canadian dollars and have been engaged in business for more than three years, and only those who specialize in transporting and selling Sino-Canadian local products in China and Canada are qualified. This kind of restriction is unprecedented in the history of trade between countries. Just imagine that the goods sold in your country's territory are not limited to those produced in China and Canada. Commodities from third countries are not prohibited items. Why can't Chinese merchants be allowed to transport them freely? This approach not only restricts trade, but is tantamount to prohibiting trade. Therefore, according to reports from overseas Chinese businessmen there, recently, no matter how strong the capital of Chinese businessmen entering Canada is, they are generally not recognized for import. Those who are already in Canada are also often subject to the local government's anti-Chinese harshness, such as prohibiting Chinese restaurants from employing white women as waitresses, and factories are not allowed to employ Chinese workers. Judging from their intentions, it seems that they want to gradually reduce all Chinese businesses in Canada. To put it bluntly, it is no different from wanting to turn mutually beneficial commerce into one-sided commerce. This is not an arbitrary empty talk from my Chamber of Commerce. As evidenced by the fact that since your country promulgated 43 immigration regulations in 1923, only four Chinese people have been granted special permission to reside there in the past seven years. In terms of imported and exported goods, in 1929, Chinese goods entering Canada were only 3 million US dollars, while in the same year, Canadian goods entering China were 23.5 million US dollars. This policy of supporting the development of one-sided commerce seems to have achieved considerable success. But can this kind of success continue to develop? Can it be without obstacles? My Chamber of Commerce believes that there is really doubt. Because the Chinese nation is a nation rich in emotion. Decades ago, the motto "Those who love others are always loved by others, and those who respect others are always respected by others" has been widely printed and imprinted in the minds of ordinary people. The era of forcing trade with gunboats has long passed. Therefore, the general public's welcome or rejection of international commerce will naturally shift according to the attitude of the other party. Therefore, anyone who holds narrow-minded views, wants to develop their one-sided commerce, and disregards the feelings of the other party, this kind of policy, if you want it to be permanently smooth and not fail, is just like the ancient saying in our country, "going south by driving the chariot north". My Chamber of Commerce knows that the mistakes in the past history of China and Canada were caused by narrow-minded politicians who wanted to please the public's psychology. But the politicians created the cause, and your country's commerce with China will reap the consequences in the future. Therefore, merchants really have the responsibility to correct it. In the past, the famous people of your country's commercial organizations did not set foot on Chinese soil, and did not know the situation in our country. There was no opportunity to have an open and honest direct meeting, so it is a pity that they allowed politicians to create many mistakes. This visit of your delegation is actually an excellent opportunity to reform the friendship between the peoples of China and Canada. Therefore, I hope that your delegation will not only pay attention to how to expand sales and how to improve commodities, but should understand the sincere attitude and earnest wishes of the Chinese people, and faithfully report what you have learned to your country's authorities and the entire people, and put forward a fair proposal to abolish the special immigration regulations for China and follow the current approach with Japan to sign a mutually beneficial commercial treaty with China. This is the best contribution and the best achievement of your delegation after returning home. My Chamber of Commerce knows that today's remarks are inevitably too straightforward. But when we make friends, we must say everything we know and say everything we can in order to show the sincerity of our friendship. Since your delegation is a good friend of my Chamber of Commerce, we should not hide anything about the permanent interests of the commerce between the two countries. Therefore, I have made a lengthy contribution during this precious time. I hope you will understand. Although the wine and dishes prepared by my Chamber of Commerce today are very simple, the feelings are very sincere. I would like to offer a toast to wish your delegation a successful mission and good health to everyone present.</p>
<p>▲Mr. Ye Mulei's Reply Briefly said that since arriving in Shanghai for two days, we have been entertained repeatedly. The members of my delegation express their gratitude. I also represent the Canadian government and offer its blessings. When we set off, the Prime Minister of Canada was in the United Kingdom, but he sent a telegram expressing his deep interest in my delegation and entrusted me to represent goodwill to the countries I visited. The Minister of Commerce of Canada has the same expression. I also represent the General Chamber of Commerce organized by 205 city chambers of commerce in Canada to greet you. We are pleased to meet an important meeting in Nanjing during our visit to China. Although we have only been here for two days, the Canadian government will definitely make a strong contribution by reporting what we have seen and heard to the Canadian government. Trade between Canada and China has developed greatly in recent years. Before 1914, the highest amount of trade was 750,000 taels. In the past five years, it has increased to 60 million taels. China was Canada's 23rd largest customer in the past, but has jumped to 8th place in the past eight years. Canada's history is only 533 years. The current race has only lived there for 327 years. At that time, they only lived in a small area along the Atlantic coast. It was only 140 years ago that Canadians first went west to the Pacific coast. Sixty years ago, the population of western Canada was less than 100,000. The initial development of our country began 25 years ago. The characteristic of that time was the development of the vast land of western Canada. After the European War, it was followed by a period of construction. In 1924, the greatest development in Canadian history began. As a result, Canada jumped to the fifth place in the world's import and export commerce. Analytically speaking, Canada's new position is fifth in imports and third in exports. Our country's foreign trade in 1929 was 750 million taels, which is about 100 million taels more than in 1900. Agriculture is still the basic industry of Canada and is also its main export. In 1929, we transported and sold 240 million taels of agricultural products abroad, and the land of production in 1929 was only one-fifth of the current land. Forests are Canada's second new source of wealth, and there has also been amazing development in recent years. Planted forests account for more than one-third of Canada's land. Canada's mineral resources are particularly rich. Last year, the value of mineral resources was 90 million taels. Hydroelectric power is also a natural resource developed in Canada after 1925. Canada's fisheries are also a major wealth. The fisheries profit in 1928 was 165 million taels. In addition, Canada's industry has invested 1500 million taels, and the annual output reaches 1000 million taels. The mission of our trip is to promote the common development of commerce between China and Canada.</p>

<h3>Canadian Immigration Problem</h3>
<p>▲Expression of the Canadian Commercial Delegation</p>
<p>The Canadian government's ban on Chinese people immigrating to Canada has recently been criticized by all sectors due to the Canadian Far East Business Inspection Delegation's visit to Shanghai. At a banquet hosted by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce last night, someone raised this issue with the delegation. The delegation said that it had no right to answer, but asked the Chamber of Commerce to prepare a memorandum and hand it over to the delegation to take away.</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Johnson Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>▲Said He Enjoyed the Banquets in Beijing Very Much</p>
<p>American Ambassador Johnson returned to Shanghai yesterday morning after going to Beijing to attend the Victory Celebration. According to him, he enjoyed the banquets in Nanjing very much. He now plans to go to Beijing again on the 25th of this month, and will stay for two or three weeks at that time. However, there are no important tasks, just wanting to go to Beijing from time to time to have face-to-face talks with important officials of the National Government.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Bruce Postpones Her Departure</h3>
<p>▲Due to Bad Weather, It is Difficult to Fly</p>
<p>British female aviator Mrs. Bruce originally planned to leave Shanghai yesterday morning and go directly to Seoul. Due to receiving weather reports that the weather in the southern part of Korea was bad, she has postponed her departure. She may depart this morning. Yesterday morning, Mrs. Bruce went to Hongqiao Airport again to inspect the aircraft parts. At 5:30 PM in the afternoon, she attended a welcome meeting at the YWCA.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of Sino-Russian Commercial Transportation</h3>
<p>▲A Lot of Fish and Wood Imported ▲Chinese Ships Waiting for Orders in Vladivostok</p>
<p>▲Chartered Ships Released Back to Shanghai Since the resumption of Sino-Russian navigation, the Soviet Russian commercial fleet, because the goods of the Russian Northern Coastal State must be shipped out before the winter freezing period and transferred to China and other places, entrusted British merchants, Laisi Yangxing in Shanghai, to charter more than 30 Chinese, Norwegian, British and other ships in Shanghai to go to the Russian Northern Coastal State to transport sea products, timber and other goods. Most of the charter periods are half a year. Now the climate in Northern Russia is already extremely cold. Among the chartered ships transporting goods in the Coastal State, except for a few British ships with strong quality and young age, the Chinese ships Minghe Wuyang, Daxing, and Fengxiang, according to telegrams, have all returned to Vladivostok, and the Norwegian ships Haifola Tuo, Pilan Ente, French ship Kaman Ensite, Hai Enlv Fulei, and Mang Nasi Tuo have been released back to Shanghai first. Each ship is fully loaded with Russian wood, wool and other goods to Shanghai. The other ships that have arrived in Vladivostok also have news of returning to Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲Large Quantities of Sea Products Arrive in Shanghai Among Russian sea products, salted fish is the largest import to China. It has not come for many years. After the two countries resumed commercial transportation this year, the fish produced in the Coastal State of that country began to be sold to China again in early autumn. Shanghai is sold by Anli and other companies as agents. From autumn to now, more than ten batches of Russian fish have arrived in Shanghai, transported by Japanese merchant ships and Laisi and other ships. The cost of the fish is estimated to be 2.34 million yuan. Shipments have temporarily stopped.</p>
<p>▲Wooden Boats Continue to Arrive Russian Northern forests are extraordinarily rich, and the quality of timber is superior to that of Japanese and American goods. This year, after Russian goods can be transported to Shanghai, a lot of timber has been imported. In the beginning, the materials shipped were mostly raw materials for matchsticks, but recently, what has been shipped are planks, which are much smoother than American wood. There are still two shipments being loaded by the Mang Nasi Tuo and other ships and are being unloaded. It is said that more than ten ships of goods can be transported to Shanghai this year.</p>
<p>▲Chinese Tea Awaiting Shipment to Russia The route for Chinese tea to Russia is huge. After the Soviet Russian Assistance Society came to Shanghai to resume the tea agency this year, it started to purchase tea leaves. In the beginning, it processed tea bricks, but now it only purchases black and green tea to transport to Russia. There are still more than 40,000 boxes of tea that have been purchased in Shanghai and have not been shipped, waiting for the Vladivostok ship to arrive before loading. It is said that the amount of Chinese tea transported to Russia this year is not as much as last year. The reasons are: (1) The Assistance Society resumed later, and most of the bulk goods were purchased by British merchants. (2) The price of tea leaves is higher than last year. Due to these two reasons, it cannot be purchased in large quantities.</p>
<p>▲Regular Liner Still Not Opened British merchants Laisi Yangxing is the authorized representative of Soviet Russian commercial ships in China. All shipping matters are handled by the company. The owner, Ma Le, had planned to open a regular Shanghai-Vladivostok route and resume formal Sino-Russian navigation. He had personally gone to Vladivostok to negotiate with the Soviet Russian authorities. Later, because the commodity trade between China and Russia had not fully recovered, and the number of passengers coming and going could not return to the original state, the four regular liners had been planned but had not yet been implemented. It is now learned that they will wait until the thaw next spring before they can be realized.</p>
<h3>Water Company Audit Completed</h3>
<p>▲Report is Being Drafted ▲It Will Be Announced Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Water Company, because of the price increase issue, aroused opposition from Chinese and foreign citizens. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent commissioners Yu Xiji, He Dekui, etc. to investigate the business accounts for reference. After a month of investigation, Mr. Yu and others have completed the investigation of the audited accounts, and will start organizing everything and drafting the audit report, which will be announced soon. Regarding the issue of whether the company should increase prices, the operating profit and loss situation reported in this report will be used to decide.</p>
<h3>Water Rate Hike and Water Cut-Off Issue</h3>
<p>▲ A Citizen's Letter ▲ The Taxpayers' Association's Statement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ratepayers' Association of the Foreign Settlement received a letter yesterday from Mr. Wu Fei, a citizen (staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department), which stated: "Respectfully, regarding the Public Utilities Waterworks Company's unreasonable increase in water rates, it has been consistently opposed by both Chinese and Western residents. Your association has also negotiated with the company and stated that before the company's account investigation is completed and the price increase is deemed necessary, the original rate should still be charged. However, the company disregarded your association's statement. I am also a resident within the settlement (on Dalian Bay Road, near Baikal Road). I received a written warning from the company, stating that I must pay the increased water rate immediately. If I do not comply with the increased payment, the water supply will be cut off. Before the case is resolved, I cannot pay according to the increased rate and must wait for your association's negotiation to resolve the matter before proceeding. Water is an essential element of citizens' lives and cannot be lacking for even a day. The settlement authorities do not allow citizens to form a second water company to operate this business, nor do they allow citizens to obtain other water sources for self-sufficiency. Now, the company uses its power to monopolize this public utility, oppresses citizens, unreasonably increases water prices, and threatens to cut off water as a means of coercion. This is truly strangling people to obtain their wealth. But in terms of reason, it is unfair. The matter concerns the vital interests of citizens. I hope that your association will take the interests of citizens as a prerequisite and strive to negotiate with the company to achieve the cancellation of the water rate increase plan. Then, the citizens within the settlement will all look forward to it." The association immediately replied, stating: "Regarding your letter of November 11th, we have received it. Your views on the Shanghai Waterworks Company's price increase are greatly appreciated. Our association will actively negotiate in accordance with public opinion. We have replied accordingly and hope you will provide further guidance."</p>
<h3>Central Exchange Certificate Cashing Issue</h3>
<p>▲ Joint Request by Certificate Holders for Redemption</p>
<p>During the Northern Expedition in the 15th year of the Republic of China, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army presented to the National Government and entrusted the General Political Department and Treasury of the Headquarters to issue 5 million yuan of temporary exchange certificates from the Central Bank. The certificates were divided into three denominations: one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan. The certificates were stamped with the seal of the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army and the official seals of the Director of the General Political Department and the Director of the Treasury. The regulations were formulated and promulgated by the Headquarters, and a proclamation was issued to inform the public of its circulation in the market, and it was fully used. The exchange certificates once circulated in Shanghai, but then suddenly stopped being cashed. Certificate-holding merchants and residents repeatedly appealed to the Ministry of Finance to redeem them. It was instructed to wait for reorganization.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>case. Now, all certificate holders believe that the Internal and External Debt Reorganization Committee has been meeting in the capital. They all believe that the issuance of the certificates was greatly beneficial to the Northern Expeditionary Army, and the government has the necessity to first reorganize and fully redeem them. Yesterday, they specially organized a joint association of certificate holders and requested Chairman Chiang, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to consider the difficulties of the merchants and immediately redeem them. They also sent letters to various groups such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to appeal. They also plan to publicly elect representatives to petition in Beijing. Also, the holders of the 9 million National Treasury Bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government on June 30th of the 16th year of the Republic of China have a similar organization and request.</p>
<h3>Wu Song River Shallow Water and Yuji Pier Blockage of Ships</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn in this port, the weather has been unusually dry, resulting in very shallow water in rivers everywhere. Small streams and ponds in the countryside have even dried up and become silted. For example, the Suzhou River (i.e., the Wu Song River) was originally an important route in this port, where merchant ships gathered to travel to and from. It reaches Wu Song and the Yangtze River in the east, and Suzhou and Wuxi and even Jiangning in the west. However, due to the narrow river surface in sections such as Zhoujiaqiao North Xinjing Yuji Pier in western Shanghai, ship blockages often occur when the water is shallow, and there is a risk of traffic disruption. Although the Dredging Bureau and the rice and shipping industries have repeatedly met to raise funds for dredging to facilitate traffic, the amount of money is quite large, and work has not yet started. Now, due to the sunny weather in recent days, merchant ships of various industries come and go to load and transport goods, one after another, day and night. It is especially crowded when the tide comes. At about 3:30 yesterday morning, a ship blockage suddenly occurred in the Yuji Pier area west of North Xinjing in northwestern Shanghai, and traffic was completely cut off. At first, there were about a hundred cargo ships, etc. As it got lighter, there were more and more at both ends of the east and west. By noon, there were about eight or nine hundred, extending for several miles. Among them, rice boats and vegetable boats were the most numerous. Even the small steamboats from Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Changshu Dangkou to Shanghai were all blocked in the boats, and the passengers were trapped in the boats. Even the rice market in Zhabei was short of rice boats. It is heard that the water patrol team and the first branch of the sixth district have sent police to try to dredge, but due to the large number of ships, it is difficult to arrange them at once. By the evening, it was still blocked, so the small steamboats of the North Suzhou Road Lao Gongmao Merchants and other steamboat bureaus to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changshu Dangkou temporarily returned all the passenger tickets sold and stopped running, temporarily suspending one shift.</p>
<h3>Various Labor Unions Assist Labor Unions in Maintaining Organizations</h3>
<p>Requesting the Fourth Plenary Session to Enact Separate Regulations for Labor Unions</p>
<p>The various labor unions in this city, in view of the fact that the national labor unions are requesting to maintain permanent organizations, sent representatives to the Fourth Plenary Session to petition, and went to great lengths to appeal. Specially, in view of the friendship of sympathy, they unanimously advocated assistance and petitioned the Fourth Plenary Session on their behalf. Now, the original text of the joint petition of the various labor unions is recorded below,</p>
<p>The petition is to request permission for workers to maintain permanent organizations and to enact separate regulations for workers' unions, in order to emphasize the movement of the people. Since the banner of the Blue Sky with a White Sun flew over Southeast China, workers' unions in various places have sprung up. Major ones such as driving out warlords and supporting the revolution, and minor ones such as improving skills and developing businesses, have become a strong and legitimate people's organization. Unexpectedly, after the Blue and White banner had been flying across the country for a long time, the Legislative Yuan enacted the Law of Industrial and Commercial Guilds and the Implementing Regulations of Guilds, which completely shaken the organization of workers' unions across the country from the root. Although representatives of the workers' unions were publicly elected and went to Beijing to petition, they were graciously granted permission to postpone the cancellation. However, due to the fact that separate regulations have not been enacted, there is a fear that they will disappear like the evening sun and morning dew. The millions of workers across the country will inevitably lose their guarantee. The members of the association belong to the same level and share weal and woe. They dare to present the reasons why the organization of workers' unions must be permanently maintained to your association in detail. It is believed that the party's doctrine first emphasizes assisting people's organizations, so those who are truly loyal to the party and the country must maintain the established people's organizations. Those that have not been established should be guided in every possible way to establish them. This is the responsibility that those who seek to implement the doctrine should fulfill. Now, workers' unions are a group that has been established for many years, and they not only have a sound organization, but also a glorious history. Instead of supporting them, they are allowed to disappear. According to the party's doctrine, this is clearly contrary to it. This is for the sake of implementing the party's doctrine, and the organization of workers' unions must be permanently maintained. Second, the development of the people's movement lies in expanding the implementation of civil rights as much as possible, especially the promotion of universal suffrage. The Implementing Regulations of Guilds stipulate that only when there are more than fifteen workers can one representative be elected to join the guild. It is found that our country's assets are backward. Not only are there no large stores in the interior, but even in large cities that can employ more than fifteen workers, it is feared that they can be counted on one's fingers. If there is no corresponding liaison agency, it will be a piece of loose sand. The procedures for election cannot be implemented, and opinions will be divided. How can reforms be sought regarding their own interests? Under the guise of merging, the reality of elimination is carried out. As a result, it will inevitably make millions of workers who can truly participate in the people's movement and exercise their rights as sparse as morning stars, hindering the people's movement and depriving civil rights. The purpose of the prime minister's efforts to revolutionize should not be so. This is for the sake of developing the people's movement and civil rights, and the organization of workers' unions must be permanently maintained. The positions of labor and capital are equal, and there are many things that are in their common interests, but when interests conflict, it will inevitably be inevitable. With workers' unions buffering in between, when the capital side exerts pressure horizontally, it can make earnest appeals on behalf of the labor side, and when the labor side makes unreasonable trouble, it can make detailed explanations on behalf of the capital side. Eliminating disputes is the best way to do this. Now, all workers' unions will be cancelled, and representatives of store clerks, who are as sparse as morning stars, will join the guild. No matter how small the amount, it will not help, and the crowd will inevitably be at the mercy of the capital side. Millions of workers will not be guaranteed for a long time. The consequences of the horizontal decision can be very dangerous. This is for the sake of eliminating labor-capital disputes, and the organization of workers' unions must be permanently maintained. In short, workers' unions are people's organizations that have been established for many years, with organization and history. Now that the period of political tutelage has begun, and we are urgently seeking to complete the construction, it is appropriate to support them to reach the realm of growth and prosperity. Under no circumstances should we cut our feet to fit the shoes and allow them to return to the position of listening to the life and death of the capital side a dozen years ago. The members of the association belong to the same labor force, and they dare not risk being presumptuous. They earnestly request that your association examine and approve the permanent organization of workers' unions and quickly enact separate regulations for workers' unions for compliance. The people's movement is fortunate, and the party and the country are fortunate. Presenting this petition, we are eagerly awaiting orders. Sincerely presented to the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang.</p>

<h3>Shipping News</h3>
<p>▲ Xinfeng Returns to Shanghai for Repairs The Zhaoshang Bureau's Beiyang liner Xinfeng was damaged by a Japanese ship in Tianjin, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the ship returned to Shanghai and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf to unload cargo. It will enter the factory for major repairs today. According to the crew of the ship, the Xinfeng was about one mile away from Tianjin Zizhu Forest at about 5:00 pm on the 8th of this month, at a place called Yangzhuangzi. It was high tide at the time, and the Xinfeng was sailing in with the current. The bow of the ship was lit up with a green light as usual. The Japanese ship Jingshan Maru was going out at this time against the current. According to the navigation regulations, the ship against the current should give way to the ship with the current. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ship did not give way, resulting in a disaster in which the two ships met and collided with each other. The upper deck and three sampans of the Xinfeng were all crushed and destroyed, and the keel was bent and the hull's 25 ribs were also damaged. The responsibility was entirely borne by the Japanese ship. Yesterday, Captain Ma Xun of the Xinfeng reported to the General Bureau. After the engineering department sent engineers to inspect the ship, it will enter the dry dock for major repairs after unloading the incoming cargo. Today, Yushun is temporarily ordered to take over the shift, and negotiations have been launched with the Japanese Post Coastal Society to claim compensation for losses.</p>
<p>▲ Tongyang New Ship Sails The Dayuan Shipping Bureau, a new company in the Tongyang line, has been preparing for a long time, and it is now ready. The routes and wharves have all been taken care of. At first, the Fushun ship was rented from Wenxing Company to run this line. Later, because the Fushun's draft was 17 feet, it could not run. It has now been returned to Wenxing, and two other ships, Yu'an (900 tons) and Da'an (850 tons), have been rented and sent to Tongyang. In Shanghai, Wharf No. 10 in Nanshi has been designated as the berth, and it is approved that the Yu'an ship will be sent to open the maiden voyage route on the 29th of this month.</p>
<p>▲ Pier Damaged and Repaired The case of Baohe Shipping Company's Yue Si Bao City ship damaging the Hongkou Pier of the Rich Qing Company and sinking ten private ship cargo barges is now being dealt with by the Rich Qing Company. Because the Yangtze River ships must berth at the pier, the Rich Qing Company has sent craftsmen to repair it. The estimated repair cost is about 20,000 taels. The Rich Qing Company has negotiated with Baohe, demanding that it bear the compensation, and is rushing to repair it. It is expected to be completed today.</p>
<p>▲ Large Batch of Silk and Tea Shipped to the UK Today, the British mail ship Camilla exported 10,000 boxes of Chinese tea purchased by British merchants in this port to London, worth one million yuan, and 500 pieces of Huzhou silk, also worth 600,000 yuan, all shipped out to London by the ship.</p>
<h3>Silk Factory Guild Notifies All Silk Factories to Open for Work by a Deadline</h3>
<p>▲ 19th of This Month</p>
<p>The committee of the Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Guild yesterday notified all silk factories, saying, "For notification matters, it is ordered by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, the Municipal Party Department's People's Training Committee, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau to quickly order all factories to open for work, so as to preserve the silk industry and the livelihood of all workers. In response to this, it is found that there are 32 factories that plan to continue to work hard to start the cars. Except for the fact that all other districts are approved to open for work on schedule, unfortunately, the nine factories in the Hongkou district that plan to open have suddenly encountered horizontal obstacles, and the impact has stopped again, which is deeply regrettable. Now, in accordance with the exhortations of party and government agencies to open for work, we should comply with the regulations. We hereby notify you that we hope that your factory will prepare immediately and open for work on the 19th of this month. The workers should still be gathered by your factory to inform them of the great righteousness. If they are persuaded, they should sign and return to work. This is very important, and please return the preparation for opening work to be reported."</p>

<p>The American firm Sinlee &amp; Co. on Nanjing Road was swindled out of diamond rings and other jewelry worth over 10,000 yuan by a European on the 31st of last month. The police were notified and requested to investigate. It is now known that the person is of New Lichtenstein nationality, named Heningen, who fled to Japan by ship after obtaining the stolen goods. Upon arrival in Kobe, he was intercepted by local authorities. The General Police Department was notified and dispatched a Western detective to Japan to extradite him. He was returned with the stolen goods the day before yesterday and handed over to the Special District Court yesterday morning. Magistrate Ge conducted the preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the defendant had many names. On August 31st, he identified himself as Wulanger from Singapore's Wulanger Jewelry Store, presenting a letter of introduction from the store. Claiming to want to purchase jewelry, Sinlee employees let him choose. He selected a platinum diamond ring worth 8,200 yuan, a platinum watch worth 1,500 yuan, a platinum watch chain worth 240 yuan, a gold cigarette case worth 680 yuan, and a gold pencil worth 690 yuan.

<p>▲Faced the Riverbank and Made Excuses to Converse</p>

<p>Zheng Xirong, manager of the Ronghua Handkerchief Factory in Jiqing Lane, Rue du Consulat, French Concession, recently received a threatening letter demanding 10,000 yuan. The letter was signed by the leader of the Daredevil Corps, surnamed Wang, instructing Zheng to deliver the money at 5:35 PM the day before yesterday to the roadside opposite the morgue on Route Tenant de la Tour. The contact point was a white cross drawn on the ground. The person delivering the money should hold a dry tobacco pipe in his right hand and carry incense and candles in his left hand for identification. If these instructions were ignored, other measures would be taken. After receiving the letter, Zheng reported it to the General Police Department of the International Settlement. The head detective dispatched detectives Ma Xiaozhi, Tian Jinfu, Han Shoushan, and others to the location as scheduled, hiding nearby. Zheng also sent Gu Caiqi to wait at the designated location as instructed in the letter. Soon, a man arrived and lingered for a long time. He then pretended to urinate, facing the riverbank, and said to Gu, "I am Wang, who sent the letter. If you are Zheng's representative, you can hand over the money." At that moment, the detectives who had been lying in ambush all around rushed forward and apprehended him. They took him to the police station. Upon questioning, the bandit's real name was Yu Kanghai, a native of Ningbo. He confessed that he was entrusted by someone to go to the location to make contact and would receive six small silver coins as compensation. The head detective ordered him to be detained.

According to Yu's confession, he was instructed to go there to make contact and would receive a reward of six small silver dollars. Subsequently, police lawyer Ru Baoyi requested a postponement for investigation. Magistrate Ge then ordered the defendant to be detained and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Bride Kidnapped</h3>
<p>▲Ransom Demand of 15,000 Yuan ▲Unexpectedly Met Her Father on the Way</p>
<p>▲Accompanied by a Man ▲Confessed to Staying in the Same Hotel</p>
<p>Yin Xiumei, a graduate of Ai Qun Girls' School, from Jiangdu, 21 years old, with bright eyes, white teeth, petite and exquisite, is the beloved daughter of Yin Shuqiao, who works at the yarn and cloth exchange. Since childhood, she was betrothed to the son of a wealthy Wu family in Zhenjiang. The wedding was scheduled for the sixth day of the tenth lunar month this year. Yin Shuqiao lived in Shanghai's Zhabei Sanguantang Bridge. Due to his busy business, he was unable to return home immediately. He ordered his beloved daughter, Xiumei, to return to Zhenjiang first to prepare for the wedding. She took a car back home on the sixth day of the ninth lunar month. Her father, Yin Shuqiao, planned to return home closer to the wedding date. Unexpectedly, Xiumei was kidnapped by several burly men only a few days after returning home. Her father received a letter in Shanghai from the First Regiment Headquarters of the Angel Army. The letter stated that his daughter was being treated with courtesy at the regiment. As the regiment was about to depart, they were requesting a loan of 15,000 silver dollars from him to help with their journey. If he complied, his daughter would be returned to his residence immediately. Otherwise, they would have to take legal action. The deadline for the money was the 24th of this month, to be delivered to the Earth God Temple between Qianjiawan and Mabi Lane. After receiving the letter, Yin Shuqiao had no such large sum of money, so he could only comply. He informed the groom's family and changed the wedding date. He secretly searched for and rescued his daughter, hoping to recover his pearl. He then returned to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, at 3:40 PM yesterday (the 17th), his beloved daughter, Yin Xiumei, was walking on Minquan Road Lao Bei Men Xi with an unfamiliar man. Her father, Yin Shuqiao, recognized her and immediately shouted, leading the police Tang Yukun from the Fifth Guard of the Second District First Precinct to arrest the man and woman together and take them to the police station. After questioning by Police Chief Qian, Yin Shuqiao stated the above. The defendant, Jiang Xueguang, 23 years old, from Wusong, who lives in a hotel, confessed that he was friends with Miss Yin Xiumei. Because Xiumei did not want to marry into the Wu family, they discussed and led Xiumei out and sent a letter to her father, requesting a loan of 15,000 yuan. However, he had no intimate relationship with Miss Xiumei. Yin Xiumei confessed that she learned that her parents arranged for her to marry a fiancé surnamed Wu, who was very bad and uneducated, and she feared that it would be difficult to live together as a couple in the future, so she did not want to marry. Because the wedding date was near, she eloped with her friend. She is now staying at a hotel with Jiang Xueguang and denied any intimate relationship. Police Chief Qian believed that the matter involved kidnapping and extortion, and the defendant Jiang Xueguang had already confessed without denial. He ordered them to be handed over to the Public Security Bureau for further investigation to deter illegal activities. Furthermore, Jiang Xueguang works at Huang Yuping's law office and studied at Peking University. He has known Yin Xiumei for many years and they have fallen in love. However, they met more than two years ago. Yin had a friend named Zhao, who lived in the Dahua Apartments in the French Concession. Jiang Xueguang was also acquainted with Zhao. At that time, Yin Xiumei often went to Zhao's place to tutor English and arithmetic, so she met Jiang and became friends. Later, they worked together in a certain party headquarters.</p>

<h3>Li Yanchun's Car Accident Injuring Male and Female Elementary School Students</h3>
<p>▲Students' Families File Lawsuit ▲Demanding Compensation for Substantial Losses</p>
<p>Li Yanchun, a traveling salesman for Mobil Oil, drove his private car (Shanghai Municipal Council license plate 10492, Shanghai Municipal Government license plate 5908) at high speed from Dixwell Road to North Szechuan Road on September 19th at 1:00 PM. He suddenly swerved onto the sidewalk, knocking down five male and female elementary school students and shattering the window of Tanaka Barber Shop. The five boys and girls who were hit were returning home for lunch and going to school together. They were walking near Yong An Li on North Szechuan Road when they were hit by Li Yanchun's car and suffered varying degrees of injury. Yang Chunhua, a girl, died from her injuries. Shen Yumei, a girl, fractured the ulna of her right arm. Shen Weiwen, a boy, suffered head and tooth injuries. The two children live at 92 Fengle Lane and are students at Guanghua School. Yang Yingyun, a girl, fractured her left foot bone. Yang Shuying, a girl, fractured her left shoulder bone and suffered a puncture wound to the head, resulting in excessive blood loss. She immediately lost consciousness. The two children live at 91 Scott Road and are students at Guangzhao Public School. The father of the two Yangs is named Yang Mingxin and is currently a customs official at the Longzhou Customs. The father of the two Shens is named Shen Huiru and is the director of the fertilizer department at Brunner, Mond &amp; Co. The victims' families hired a lawyer to file a criminal and civil lawsuit against Li Yanchun in the Special District Court. Yang Mingxin could not come to Shanghai to testify because he was in another location, so he commissioned his relative Yang Sulan to appear in court on his behalf, demanding that Li Yanchun pay maintenance fees of 5,000 taels for Yang Yingyun, 5,000 taels for Yang Shuying, 10,000 taels for Shen Yumei, and 3,000 taels for Shen Weiwen. Medical expenses of 1,200 taels for Yang Yingyun, 300 taels for Yang Shuying, 600 taels for Shen Yumei, and 1,500 taels for Shen Weiwen. The hearing was held in the Special District Court yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, presided over by Judge Shen. The defendant, Li Yanchun, claimed that he was returning from fighting a fire that day. Judge Shen said that even if he was fighting a fire, he could not disregard human life. The hearing was scheduled to continue next Monday.</p>
<h3>Xin Dingxiang's Family Submits Document to Municipal Public Security Bureau</h3>
<p>Xin Dingxiang's family submitted a document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, stating that it was submitted regarding the tragic death of Xin Dingxiang and requesting that they negotiate and severely punish the murderer. Xin's son, Dingxiang, was shot by French sailors, fell into the river, and died. They received instructions from the Bureau to have the Marine Police Station summon them to the case. They were also informed that the French Consul General, Genglin, had agreed to strictly detain the sailors involved in the case and ordered them to immediately open a loss sheet for everything after the death, so that they could negotiate compensation with the French Consul General. This showed the Bureau's utmost intention to protect the people, for which they were deeply grateful. However, the most important point in this case was to punish the murderer, and compensation was secondary. Although the French Consul General had stated that the sailors involved in the case would be strictly detained, it was not known which sailors were being punished, or what their names were. Even if the right to judge had not been recovered and they could not be punished according to our country's laws, it should be clearly announced which laws of that country were being cited, so that the truth could be clarified and confusion avoided. The family was deeply saddened by their son's death and had no choice but to plead with the Bureau to negotiate strictly, striving to announce the above details as much as possible and consider the punishment to be commensurate with the crime. Only then would they discuss compensation, otherwise they would not be willing to accept it. They tearfully stated that they could not wait to hear back from the Municipal Public Security Bureau Director Yuan of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Kidnapper You Quan'gen in Liu Nianchun Case Arrested</h3>
<p>The Wuxi Fellow-Villagers Association investigated You Quan'gen and found that most of his acquaintances were bandits. They often sipped tea at the Jinshui Teahouse near Xinzha. After Liu Nianchun, who lived at 911 North Chengdu Road, was kidnapped by bandits, and after the police arrested several of the kidnappers, You suddenly stopped going to the teahouse. Later, the arrested bandits confessed that You was an accomplice. The Special District Court ordered a strict arrest, but he had already sneaked back to his hometown of Liangxi. He later read in the newspaper that his accomplices had been sentenced, so he returned to Shanghai. On Saturday last week, Xinzha Police Detective Zhang Ankang received a tip that You would be going to a restaurant at 39 Fujian Road at 1:00 PM that day for a meal. He rushed to the restaurant with detective Zhang Hanying and Western detectives to arrest him. At first, he was nowhere to be found. They waited until 6:00 PM, when You leisurely entered from the outside and was about to order food when he was apprehended by the Chinese and Western detectives, taken back to the police station, and detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan briefly described the case, requesting an extension due to the need to investigate everything. Judge Wu questioned You Quan'gen and ordered him to be detained and the hearing rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Man Killed by Black Car</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, an unidentified man wearing a black jacket and trousers, about twenty years old, was walking near Dananmen when a black car suddenly came from the east, speeding west. The man was unable to avoid it and was knocked to the ground, with the car wheels running over his body, causing injuries and bleeding from his nose. Seeing that he had caused an accident, the driver immediately accelerated and fled. The patrolman from the First Precinct Third Substation noticed this. He copied down the car's license plate number as 5858. He then took the injured man to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but he died shortly after arriving at the hospital due to his severe injuries. He immediately reported this to Police Chief Jin, who, considering the matter involved a death, ordered Gu Tiayun, the neighborhood chief of the Twelfth Ward, to report to the Local Court and request an autopsy. He also dispatched a senior officer to investigate. It was learned that the car belonged to Wu Miaosheng, the owner of Shen Da Rice Store at 45 Wangjia Wharf. He had gone to Zhabei on business, driven by his driver, Chen A'di, from Ningbo. He did not expect to cause the accident when driving through Dananmen.

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:00 PM, a Western patrolman from the Marine Police Station was patrolling the Suzhou River by boat when he suddenly saw a teenager jump into the river from the Jiangxi Road Bridge to commit suicide. He immediately took measures to rescue him and took him to the police station. The teenager claimed to be Chen Zaiyou, 19 years old, from Taizhou, but the rest of his words were unclear. He then suffered a mental breakdown, jumping around the police station, crying and laughing, muttering incoherently. The head detective, finding him impossible to reason with, dispatched detective Wu Rongsheng to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was diagnosed that his nerves seemed to have been severely stimulated. When they tried to take him back to the police station, the man refused to walk and raised his hands to strike the detectives. He was as strong as an ox, so the detectives had to add handcuffs before he would comply. Upon arriving at the police station, the head detective temporarily detained him, pending investigation and identification by his family to take him home.</p>

<h3>Xu Chunrong Detained Due to Shareholding Dispute</h3>
<p>Well-known businessman Xu Chunrong and Chen Weirong, Gao Fanglin, Zhu Chenshi and others co-founded Ruishenghe Silk Shop, with Chen as the manager. They had profits for many years. Later, because Xu Chunrong engaged in real estate business, he used the Silk Shop's savings to purchase real estate, causing Ruishenghe's capital turnover to be strained and eventually shut down. Zhu Chenshi hired a lawyer to sue for the division of shares and the distribution of dividends. The court ruled that Xu Chunrong, Chen Weirong, Gao Fanglin, Gao Weiquan, etc., were jointly responsible and should compensate the plaintiff Zhu Chenshi the amount she deserved according to her shares. Xu and others were dissatisfied and repeatedly appealed to the Supreme Court, which was delayed for three years. The final judgment was made this spring and was still enforced according to the original judgment. The Special District Court repeatedly decided to hold a hearing, but Xu and others avoided appearing. Recently, they issued an arrest warrant, ordering the plaintiff to identify and arrest them for execution. After Zhu Chenshi inquired in many ways, she learned that Xu and others often went to Lao Zhenhe Dyeing Shop. So, she went to the dyeing shop with the clerks and police detectives of the Special Court and arrested Xu Chunrong. The executing judge, Xiong Fei, held a court hearing and ordered Xu to be sent to the detention center to be detained, and he would be released after he paid off the debts. It is said that Xu is a native of Shaoxing, and he has many businesses in Shanghai and is good at doing good deeds and has many acquaintances. His friends are now planning to petition the court to demand bail.</p>

<h3>Domestic Business Circles Prepare the Dahua Winter Clothing Exhibition</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Nanjing Road China National Products United Department Store proposed the reorganization, it has strived to improve the setup of branches and the overall planning of the store, thus the atmosphere has been completely refreshed and the business has become increasingly prosperous. In particular, the Dahua National Products woolen fabrics in the store's piece goods department are especially popular among Chinese people. Mr. Gu Jiuru, the manager of Dahua, in view of this, specially entrusted Mr. Zhang Zilian, the founder of the store, to hold a Dahua National Products woolen fabrics winter clothing exhibition to promote it widely. A preparatory committee has already been organized and is working on it. It is said that the venue will be the large auditorium on the right side of the shopping mall, and the dates for the event are the 29th and 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Peng Daxun and Others Re-sue the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory</h3>
<p>Since the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory fire, the bereaved families, including Zhang Daxun, entrusted lawyer Yan Lunkui to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office, requesting a legal investigation and ordering the factory to provide compensation. Many days have passed since then, but no summons have been received. Peng and others are all poor workers, and this lawsuit is a last resort. If the judicial authorities do not resolve it soon and allow them to continue suffering from the lawsuit, then their future situation would be even more unimaginable. Therefore, Lawyer Yan has drafted another petition to re-sue. The text of the petition is as follows:</p>
<p>To further request a strict investigation according to the law and to order compensation. This is regarding the case of Daxun and others suing Wu Desheng and others of the Fuchang Military Uniform Factory. We have repeatedly petitioned your office to resolve it quickly, but no summons have been received. Your office may consider the matter to be of great importance and should conduct a lengthy investigation. However, Daxun and others believe that the truth of the defendant's illegal acts and the tragic circumstances of the victims are already obvious and easily discernible. Moreover, the bereaved families are all poor and helpless common people, while the defendant is a capitalist with abundant savings. While a capitalist can afford a lengthy lawsuit, the poor common people are already burdened by the lawsuit. A capitalist with money may be able to escape the law, while a common person with grievances must resort to the court. Capitalists can disregard the law, while common people must rely on the law for protection. Therefore, after investigation, in terms of public prosecution, the defendant is indeed guilty of the crime in Article 187, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code for causing the fire; in terms of closing the factory door during the fire, the defendant is indeed guilty of the provisions of Article 196 of the Criminal Code; in terms of incidental private prosecution, according to the legal provisions for calculating the age of the deceased, their income before death, and the medical and recuperation expenses of the injured, the defendant is indeed obliged to pay 48,740 yuan in compensation. Public prosecution and private prosecution, both in terms of legal principles and human sentiments, are reasons for the defendant to be blamed and there is no room for denial. Daxun and others urgently seek a resolution, like expecting clouds in a drought, and are oppressed by poverty, filled with grievances. They have a feeling that if it is not resolved in one day, there will be no relief in one day; if there is no relief in one day, there will be no survival in one day. Therefore, we do not hesitate to bother you again and present the situation. We implore your office to have a gentleman's compassion, to understand the suffering of the victims, to conduct a strict investigation according to the law quickly, and to order compensation in order to provide relief. Then the dead and the living will praise your immeasurable merits. Respectfully submitted, To the Prosecutor's Office of the Shanghai Local Court, by Peng Daxun et al., Private Prosecution Attorney Yan Lunkui, November 17th, 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Honor to the Red Cross Ambulance Team</h3>
<p>Due to the spread of war, the Chinese Red Cross Society had previously organized and dispatched an ambulance team for rescue operations. Now that the war has ended, the team has returned to Shanghai a few days ago. Yu Feipeng, Director-General of the Land, Sea, and Air Force Headquarters' Logistics, presented a large silver shield, and Liu Chuanlian, Director of the Logistics Hygiene Department, also presented a silver shield to Bao Kangning, the captain of the ambulance team. They were specially sent to Shanghai by Mr. Zhang Yunsen, along with a letter of appreciation. Director-General Yu's letter stated: "Dear Sirs, after Yan and Feng rebelled and caused chaos, the Central Government, in order to uphold its authority and rectify discipline, had no choice but to send troops to suppress them. Since the beginning of the war, it has lasted for half a year, and the casualties of soldiers have reached tens of thousands. We are grateful for your Society's enthusiasm and efforts to assist, providing treatment and healing, without distinction. Now that Qin and Long have been pacified and Hebei has been stabilized, we are promoting culture and restoring the country. Remembering your hard work, we are deeply impressed. We hereby present a silver shield for your safekeeping to express our gratitude. This is addressed to the General Office of the Chinese Red Cross Society." Director Liu's letter stated: "Dear Sirs, this year in May, Yan and Feng caused chaos, and the Central Government had no choice but to use force. The intensity of the battles on the Jinpu and Longhai lines was unprecedented. At that time, the layout of the hospitals had not yet been completed, and the wounded soldiers from the front line were sent down in large numbers, and it was difficult to delay their reception and treatment. We are grateful for your Society's firm support and the dispatch of Captain Bao to lead the team for rescue operations. Your medical skills saved the country, and your kindness was deeply appreciated by the Party and the country. Now that the stubborn enemies have been eliminated and the Party's foundation is firmly established, we are deeply moved by your hard work. In addition to the silver shield presented by our Director-General to thank all the colleagues of your Society for their achievements, we hereby present a small silver shield to Captain Bao to express our respect and admiration. We hope that your Society will continue to promote its great public welfare ideals. This is addressed to the General Office of the Chinese Red Cross Society." It is reported that the Red Cross stated that dispatching ambulance teams to treat wounded soldiers was their duty, and they dare not take credit for it. They have kept the shields as a souvenir and sent separate letters of thanks.</p>
<h3>Petition for Disaster Relief in Huaiyin County</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Jishang Society stated that Zhou Yuankai, the chairman of the Qingjiang Jishang Branch, and Wang Baohuai, the representative of the Huaiyin County Bandit Disaster Relief Committee, came to the meeting and stated that in Huaiyin County, where the National Army was stationed to suppress the rebellion this year, the garrison was weak, and bandits took the opportunity to plunder and burn. There were even cases where entire villages were left without a single house. They were in dire straits and requested relief. According to a joint letter from Han Zhao, Li Yushu, Liu Dingxin, Cao Bingqian, Ruan Kaiji and other executive committee members of the Huaiyin County Bandit Disaster Relief Committee, it said that there have always been many bandit problems in Jiangbei. Because the country has many problems and the suppressing troops are few, bandits are rising up like bees, and wherever they pass, it becomes a wasteland. They kidnap people and livestock, loot and burn houses. Compared to famine years, disaster victims still have livestock to sell, but now there are only empty barns; they used to have places to live, but now they are half scorched earth. In total, thousands of houses have been destroyed, and tens of thousands of people have been affected. They are exposed to the wind and sleep in the open, not only without clothes or food, but also without shelter. At this time when the north wind is howling and severe cold is approaching, they are suffering from both cold and hunger, and their lives are hopeless. Zhao and others could not bear to sit idly by, so they organized a relief committee. They deeply worry that the disaster is severe and the area is wide, and that a small amount of aid cannot save them. They can only rely on the generosity of kind people for relief grain and kind soup. They have always admired your Society's great compassion and desire to save all. The victims of the disaster urgently need help. They respectfully request your special assistance to save the lives of the people. The Society is currently handling winter relief and work relief projects in Shaanxi, Beiping, Liaoning, Zhoutai, Jiangsu and other places, and the funds used have already been considerable. They rely entirely on the voluntary donations of kind and charitable people. This year, due to the economic recession, donations have sharply declined. After listening to the statement of the Huaiyin County representative and the letter from the County Relief Association, the Society expressed its great sympathy. However, due to financial difficulties, they could not find a solution. They hope that many kind people in Suzhou will not ignore and fail to help them.</p>
<h3>Nanning City Encirclement Disaster Report in Guangxi</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday received a disaster area map of Nanning City made and sent by the Nanning Branch, detailing the disaster areas demolished, the disaster areas destroyed by aircraft bombing, the disaster areas destroyed by artillery shells, and the disaster areas robbed by bandits. The devastation is shocking. It is reported that the city has been closed since July 17 and opened on October 13. During the siege, there were a total of eighty-eight days, with tens of thousands of victims and more than two thousand injured. The branch has established many refugee camps in Macun, Pumiao and other places in Yongzhou, and hopes that all sectors of society at sea will provide assistance in order to reverse the catastrophe. If any philanthropists designate donations for Nanning, please send them directly to the Chinese Red Cross Society at Er Ma Road, which will be transferred to the branch immediately and a receipt will be issued first to ensure credibility.</p>
<h3>Verdict Announced in Case of Car Killing Vietnamese Police Officer</h3>

<p>In the French Concession, Vietnamese police officer No. 398 of the Songshan Road Police Station was on duty at the intersection of Pubo Road and Sapo Sai Road last month when he was hit and killed by two cars driven by drivers Sun Zulin and Yu Xinkui. The French Police Station summoned the two defendants to the French Public Court for investigation and concluded the case, with the verdict scheduled to be announced. Yesterday, on the date of the verdict announcement, the police station summoned the two parties. The Chinese and Western judges ordered each of the two defendants to pay a fine of 10 yuan and jointly compensate the family of the deceased with a bereavement payment of 2,500 yuan. Defendant Yu Xinkui had repeatedly violated regulations and his license was revoked and he was permanently prohibited from working as a driver, as a warning for the future.</p>
<h3>Careless Military Uniform Factory Fire</h3>
<p>▲Several Military Uniforms Burned ▲Fortunately, the Fire Did Not Spread to Buildings</p>
<p>At around 7:00 yesterday morning, a fire suddenly broke out at the Shenyuan Military Uniform Factory at No. 2 Sanxing Lane, Zhongshan Road, Zhabei, for unknown reasons. In an instant, smoke filled a pile of military uniforms, and sparks flew. Fortunately, it was noticed early and the Zhabei Fire Department was immediately notified by telephone. The fire trucks rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after a while. Only a few military uniforms were slightly damaged, and the fire did not spread to the buildings, which was fortunate.</p>
<h3>Fundraising in the Name of False Charity</h3>
<p>▲The Social Affairs Bureau Discovered Two Cases... Already Under Investigation</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently found that the Shanghai Ciye Charity Association, in the name of holding medical and clothing services, had run out of funds, and falsely claimed to hold a theatrical performance at the Gengxin Stage on the 8th of this month, selling theater tickets to raise money from all walks of life. When personnel were dispatched to the address for investigation, no responsible personnel were found. It was agreed to go again at 2 p.m. the next afternoon, and the association's staff were told not to leave. Unexpectedly, when the investigation was conducted again the next day, the association had moved elsewhere the night before, and the address was also unclear. Seeing the situation, they evaded the Bureau. It was also reported that someone was holding a donation book and soliciting donations everywhere in the name of the Chengji Charity Association. The donation book, donation charter and receipts were detained and sent for investigation. After receiving the report, the Bureau believed that since the Chengji Charity Association had not applied for registration or been approved to solicit donations without authorization, it violated the law. It is reported that it has been investigating and prohibiting it.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury Outside Dadongmen</h3>
<p>Meng Defa, a 37-year-old man from Shaoxing, used to make a living as a boatman. He sailed a boat from his hometown to Shanghai a few days ago. At around 2 pm yesterday, he arrived at the Yongsheng Wharf in Nanshi. After anchoring, he carried 900 yuan to purchase goods on behalf of a customer and rushed ashore. He went straight to the Datong Salted Fish Shop at the Grand Wharf to order goods. He paid 100 yuan in advance on the spot, and kept the rest of the money in his waistband. Unexpectedly, when Meng took out the money from his pocket, two thugs happened to be standing on the side of the road and saw his pile of banknotes, and immediately had the idea of ​​coveting it. After Meng said goodbye and left, he planned to go to other places to shop, but the two thugs followed him. When he arrived near Longde Bridge outside Dadongmen, seeing that there were few people around, the two thugs jumped forward and carried out their robbery. Unexpectedly, Meng was very strong and the two were no match for him. Then one of the thugs took out a pistol, pulled the trigger, and fired a shot, hitting Defa's right arm. When ordinary pedestrians suddenly heard the gunshot, they gathered to watch. The thugs took the opportunity to escape, and the silver dollars were not taken. After receiving the news, the patrol officer of the responsible Public Security Bureau led the police to the scene, but the bandits had already fled. Later, Meng was accompanied by his friend Wang Jiren to the Shanghai Hospital. At 11:30 that evening, he was transferred to the Baolong Hospital, where the doctor tried to remove the bullet, applied medicine and treated him.</p>

<h3>Record of an Unconventional Couple</h3>
<p>— Wang Meiju</p>
<p>My friend, a descendant of a Jinshi from Zhongnan, possesses the handsomeness of Zifang and the talent of Zijian. His fiancée is a true descendant of Xie Daoyun, beautiful in appearance and intelligent within, not an ordinary woman. Last Sunday, I drove to visit them, but while the house was near, the person felt far away. On the table, pink envelopes piled up like layered peaks. Someone told me, "This gentleman is quite peculiar. The engaged couple troubles the Blue Bird with letters every day, conveying messages back and forth. There are even days when they receive three messages." I then jokingly wrote on the envelope, "The Blue Bird conveys sweet words all day long, when will the lovebirds be able to roost together?" Everyone who saw it laughed. One person even said, "Are you still unaware of the situation?"</p>
<p>A few days later, I visited again. We exchanged a smile upon meeting and arranged a banquet to catch up. I then asked, "Sir, you are so young and strong. Why delay the wedding and only send letters to communicate?" He replied, "My abilities are not yet sufficient to establish a household." However, this gentleman, although not born into wealth, has a fixed income and is famous in literary circles, his writings fetching high prices. His monthly income is quite substantial. His words must not be sincere, so I pressed him with wine, hoping he would reveal his true feelings after becoming drunk. His teacher, Mr. Gaoyang, who was present, said to me, "This is a naturally matched, unconventional couple. He once confided his sincerity to me." Zhongnan stopped the teacher with his eyes, but the teacher ignored him, speaking freely without reservation.</p>
<p>This gentleman values noble love and cherishes the union of spirits. The "Willow Catkin" also shares the same sentiment. Every ten days or so, she must visit Xutai to see his face. The letters they exchange are frequent and long, with both parties being of one mind. He says, "The love of an engaged couple is like fine wine, like sweet honey, like a flower about to bloom, like a moon about to be full. Once there is a physical union, although it may be delightful, it is the end. Nothing more can be added. Moreover, planning household affairs and raising children, even if love does not crack, mundane matters are enough to hinder pure love. It is better to remain neither close nor distant, like glue or lacquer, as it is today." After Gaoyang revealed his thoughts, Zhongnan also revealed a little under the influence of alcohol, saying, "I cherish this 'just right' time, learning from the 'celestial lovers' in the Daoist books, regarding each other as Yin and Yang." I laughed and said, "Then will it end here?" He said, "No. When it can no longer be delayed, we must also become a machine for creating humans for the world." A mad guest in the room suddenly said, "This is a descendant of Zhongnan. Perhaps he will open a Zhongnan shortcut in the realm of love. It is unknowable." Zhongnan did not argue or show any embarrassment. I know his views are genuine and cannot be judged by ordinary standards. Thus, I wrote this: "An Unconventional Couple."</p>
<h3>Listening to Autumn Sounds at the Chrysanthemum Planting Gathering</h3>
<p>— Jasmine</p>
<p>The Chrysanthemum Planting Gathering, initiated by Mr. Yu Shun'en, the owner of a Shanghai plantation, has been held at the Nanjing Road Municipal Hall for the past ten days. In addition to displaying various famous chrysanthemums, there is also a calligraphy and painting exhibition initiated by Ms. Yu Danhan and performances by various opera enthusiasts from Shanghai. On the 12th, Cheng Yanqiu performed "Qijie" as a farewell performance, causing a sensation.</p>
<p>When we entered, it was still 3 PM. We first went to see the calligraphy and painting, all works by modern masters. Ms. Yu Danhan has recently studied with Mr. Huang Binhong from my hometown, and her artistic skills have improved greatly. The works she displayed were elegant and extraordinary. Other works, such as Lou Xinhu's landscapes and Ma Mengrong's flowers, each had their own merits. The waterfall painting by Lou was particularly impressive in its imposing style, and viewers praised it endlessly. Mr. Li Haoran of the Xinwenbao also had calligraphy and paintings on display. Li's paintings are rarely seen by outsiders. His works are as gentle and honest as he is, truly exquisite.</p>
<p>While wandering around, we met several friends. I said that since the gathering is named "Chrysanthemum Planting," even if we don't have the obsession of Tao Yuanming, we should at least appreciate them a little. So we strolled around for a week together. By then, Yu Shuang had arrived, accompanied by Mr. Wang Xiaolai, who led her to the calligraphy and painting exhibition for a brief viewing. Yu Shuang is inherently elegant and praised the works of the masters. Then, some people asked Yu Shuang to sign her name as a souvenir. Immediately, dozens of people gathered around. Yu Shuang could not refuse and reluctantly obliged. As she picked up the pen, the onlookers shouted "Bravo!" After she finished signing, some shouted, "One more!" By then, she was surrounded by the crowd. It is said that she signed more than a dozen names that day.</p>
<p>After Yu Shuang returned to the Chrysanthemum Planting Gathering office to put on makeup, everyone knew she was about to go on stage and rushed to the hall. By then, "Ximen Bao" was coming to an end, and the audience was energized. Yu Shuang had finished her makeup and had to take the stage early. The opera "A Woman Escorted" was one that Yu Shuang had not performed since coming south this time, which made it even more anticipated. A mournful cry from behind the curtain won the full applause of the audience. Yu Shuang's costume was more beautiful than usual, and her singing was earth-shattering and universally praised, so there is no need for me to add more. However, due to the limited time that day, she only sang four lines of the "Fan Erhuang." Those who loved to hear Yu Shuang's tragic and mournful songs regretted not being able to satisfy their desire. Jiang Bogong, who played Chong Gongdao, was quite competent. However, there were too many temporarily added lines. Nevertheless, it was commendable that a new actor could handle the performance alongside a famous star so calmly. After "A Woman Escorted," there was also Wang Detian's "Caoqiao Pass." I left early because it was late, regretting not being able to hear Mr. Wang's magnificent voice.</p>
<h3>The Great Controversy of the Small Champagne Rejection</h3>
<p>— Xin Wei</p>
<p>In Shanghai, during the spring and autumn racing seasons, the purchase of champagne tickets is becoming increasingly popular. In the past, the Race Club openly sold them, but now it has gradually reached the point where non-members have no right to purchase tickets. This year, it has gone even further, only selling the numbers without issuing tickets. However, buyers are still scrambling to be the first. The A-type tickets are insufficient, so B-type tickets are added. The Chinese people's desire for luck and speculation is also growing daily. Furthermore, some groups, during the racing season, take advantage of the fact that Shanghai residents cannot buy the big champagne tickets, so they sell their so-called "small champagne" tickets. They use the winning numbers of the A-type champagne as a basis for their small champagne drawing. People from the lower and middle classes who cannot afford the big tickets switch to buying these small champagne tickets. The term "small champagne" has become a time-sensitive term in Shanghai. Some sell one number for five jiao, while others sell five to ten numbers for one yuan.</p>
<p>During this autumn's small champagne drawing, a controversy arose regarding a stolen ticket winning and the rejection of the prize. The Chinese and Foreign Catering Association, organized by hotel staff, serves as a recreational organization for hotel employees during their off-hours. The association, in order to raise funds, followed the example of the railway employees' club and also sold small champagne tickets. Each ticket had ten numbers and sold for one silver dollar. Tickets were sold by members. The prize money was two-thirds of the total amount, so there were many buyers.</p>
<p>A Russian pianist from a certain large hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road bought a small champagne ticket from the association. Due to carelessness, he lost it on the ground. A waiter from the same hotel picked it up but did not know who had lost it at the time. The waiter sold the ticket to someone named Tao. After losing the ticket, the Russian went to the association to report the loss. The association, citing the rule that "lost tickets will not be replaced," could not reissue the ticket. The Russian could only consider himself unlucky.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, when the champagne number 6 was drawn, one of the lost tickets, number 23523, from the paper with numbers from 23521 to 23530, won the second prize. Tao was overjoyed, while the Russian was devastated. The catering association did not know that the ticket was in someone's possession and mistakenly thought there was no need to pay the prize. A few days ago, Tao brought the ticket to redeem the prize, but the catering association refused to pay, saying that the ticket was the Russian's lost property and that Tao's origin was unclear. Tao swore that he had purchased it from a friend. The association firmly refused to pay. Tao argued reasonably, citing the words "no reliance on the person, no reliance on the ticket" on the ticket and explaining his source to show that he had indeed purchased it.</p>
<p>The association has convened a meeting of all members to discuss how to handle the matter and to investigate how the Russian's lost ticket ended up in Tao's hands. Tao has hired a lawyer to negotiate with the catering association. If they refuse to pay the prize, he will file a lawsuit to seek a legal resolution. It is said that the matter is still unresolved.</p>
<h3>Food in Hancheng</h3>
<p>— Tian Xian</p>
<p>Among Shanghai's restaurants, those of Anhui and Ningbo origins have always been the most famous. In recent years, Cantonese restaurants have also sprung up vigorously. Cantonese food is popular and gaining momentum. However, Cantonese cuisine is exquisite in general, not just in Guangzhou. Hancheng (Chaozhou) cuisine also has its own unique flavor.</p>
<p>In this city, only Xu Dexing's restaurant in Mantingfang is a large-scale Chaozhou restaurant. It was founded by a Chaozhou native named Xu. People from that area refer to his restaurant as "Lao Xu Zai" rather than by its store name. The dishes they prepare are extremely exquisite and palatable, not as greasy as those of Anhui and Ningbo, and fresher than Cantonese cuisine. However, because they do not advertise, customers are mostly Chaozhou people. Foreigners rarely pass by their door.</p>
<p>Now, the Pacific Restaurant has hired a famous chef and added Chaozhou dishes. Their cooking and presentation are far superior to Xu Dexing's. Therefore, diners all praise it. In particular, the shark fin dish is the most outstanding. Their winter seasonal specialties include raw fish hot pot, etc., which have a completely different flavor from those sold in the market. Mr. Zilan has tried it and praised its taste.</p>
<p>▲Short News The Paris Grand Theater has recently imported many silent feature films from abroad, which will be shown one after another. The film currently being shown is "The Soul of Beauty." This film is the most prestigious production of UFA in 1930. The lead actress is the European star Brigitte Helm. The plot is sadly glamorous, and the performance is divine and delicate. The previous hit "Scientific World" was also starred by the same actress. The next film to be shown is Ramon Novarro's "Flying World." This film is truly unprecedented in its greatness among aviation films. When this film was made, the entire fleet of the US Aviation Department performed amazing techniques. In several scenes, the planes flew over the Atlantic Ocean, hindered by violent storms and heavy rain. The engine exploded, and the plane fell into the ocean. All kinds of startling and breathtaking spectacles are truly unseen. (Ban Yun)</p>
<h3>Travels in Southeast Asia (75)</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 9th, Liang ordered a car to take us to see the silver mine. This is only a part of what he manages. The method is to first crush the raw ore into sand, mix it with three types of silver ore sand, and melt it in fire. If the three types are not combined, silver cannot be separated. After melting into flowing mud, it goes through several processes to become a silver ingot. It is very difficult. This mine can earn a gross income of 300,000 silver dollars per day, about 50 million per year. The capital is 20 million, and there are more than 20,000 workers. Chinese account for one-tenth, with the rest mostly being Indians. There are also Burmese. It used to have American shares, but now it is entirely British. There are only two to three hundred British people. Most of the Chinese workers are from Yunnan. Cantonese are mostly merchants or carpenters. Indians are peaceful and cannot resist others. Chinese are sometimes very fierce. The British dare not insult them either. The daily wage is at least one shield and a quarter. They only work eight hours a day. There is no holiday because the large pot needs several days to heat up once it cools down. Liang said that Chinese workers can do everything, but they cannot create delicate things because they are uneducated. However, earning foreign money here to support our people is better than being a warlord killing people and taking their wealth.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I visited the Peide School. The school building is spacious and does not charge tuition. I visited the party headquarters and met with Mr. Chen Ruiwen.</p>
<p>There used to be eighteen Temples of the God of Wealth here, indicating great superstition. A large piece of animal skin was hanging in Liang's house. I was surprised by its size. It was very different from the ones at home. The tigers in ordinary zoos can jump ten feet high. Seeing its teeth three inches long and as thick as a thumb, it is truly a big animal. If there are no guns in the countryside and the Burmese houses are all thatched huts, it would be truly terrifying if this big animal visited. Therefore, everyone in Southeast Asia fears this mountain lord. It is not without reason. Lao Tzu said, "What everyone fears, you must fear." I also had the experience of turning pale at the mention of tigers here because I had only seen small tigers in zoos before, so I did not realize how scary they were. A friend told me how to avoid tigers: tigers are truly straightforward and do not bother chasing people to eat. They only pounce a few times. You can see how cats catch mice. If they fail to pounce three times, the tiger will give up. Therefore, the saying goes, "Tigers do not eat food they have turned away from." The way to avoid tigers is to turn around to confuse their direction, and the tiger will abandon you. Leopards, on the other hand, chase people to eat and are not as generous as the mountain lord. As for controlling snakes, once, someone was drunk and passed by a well late at night. Others warned him that there was a big snake by the well and that he should not pass by. But he insisted on passing by. The big snake was indeed there. So he lay down on the ground and looked up. The snake came and coiled around him. He struggled and rolled violently, breaking the snake's bones. As a result, the snake died. He then carried the snake back home, and everyone who saw him ran away. This is how to control snakes. Mountain people live in the mountains and understand the nature of wild animals.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (87)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>▲Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (9)</p>
<p>As we followed him into the layers of cellars, a chilling sensation suddenly touched me. Walking in a narrow, dark passage, the walls were lined with rows of niches. These niches were where the remains of the sacrificed were buried. The visible skeletons are still exposed. In this dark and eerie realm, how dark, how desolate, how cold. At this moment, I could not help but feel afraid for no reason. Suddenly, the candle in my hand went out. The cold air stabbed straight at me, as if I were being pinned down by a skeleton hidden in a niche. It seemed very close, almost touching me. After walking for a good ten minutes, it was still a dark, narrow road. A colder air was even more intense. The niches on both sides were even more intricate. They endured darkness and willingly sacrificed themselves, so they rest here forever. No, it is hard to say. Back then, they could not speak even if they wanted to. Their suffering must have been unspeakable. After passing through the narrow and dark passage, we entered a stone chamber newly discovered in the nineteenth century. Inside, there is a praiseworthy altar. It is a short hall under a dome. The dome is painted with strange flowers, lambs, peacocks, and pigeons. In the middle is a spiral staircase. As we gradually walked from the spiral staircase to the ground, it was like ascending to a bright paradise.</p>
<p>This is the budding of early Christian art. Later, this tradition developed and evolved into Romanesque, Byzantine, and Gothic architectural art. Finally, it produced the Renaissance. Thus, it dominated Christian culture and art for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Further on is the tomb of Cecilia Metella, standing on the mountain overlooking the endless oil-like green lawns, full of tall, straight palm trees. Among the trees, the intermittent aqueducts of ancient Rome stand majestically. The ancient red brick arches emit a golden-red light under the scorching sun, rendering a spicy tone, extending all the way to the distant horizon and disappearing. The dome of St. Paul's Church in the blue sky, glittering and magnificent, is truly like a brocade that can be praised. At this moment, you will forget everything and truly feel that Rome has unparalleled glory and is truly an eternal treasure trove.</p>
<p>After gazing at the view here, I drove back. Under a grape arbor near the Colosseum, I hurriedly ate lunch. Afterwards, we went to the embassy.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Market Attitude Peaceful</h3>
<p>▲Yesterday, the gold market for 1 tael and 2 taels was peaceful. However, the price fluctuated only a few taels, and ultimately declined slightly. The sentiment among traders was disordered. The foreign exchange trend was stable, with banks making deposits and withdrawals from time to time, but the market was not very active. Shunli, Yifengyong, and the arbitrage were buying, while Yuanmaoyong, Xinyong, and Xheng were selling.</p>
<p>The market was stable in the morning, as the slight increase in overseas silver markets the day before did not cause much reaction. Afterwards, sellers became more active, and the market became weak. The buying back of sales by Yuanchengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, and Fuchang also contributed to the increase, reaching more than 79 taels. However, due to scattered sales of drafts, the price dropped slightly. Later, the market became even less active. The market was initially firm, but suddenly there was a rumor that the injury of Prime Minister Hamaguchi of Japan was critical, and the large traders such as Yufengyong sold, causing a sharp decline of more than one or two taels. In the end, the market seemed to soften.</p>
<p>▲The market in the morning fluctuated. The opening price for January was 577.5 taels, a slight drop of 0.04 taels (the gross price once reached 0.09 taels but fell back to less than 0.08 taels due to selling by Yuanmaoyong). The price of large silver ingots was 1/16 higher than the day before, and the price of silver was also 1/8 higher. Overall, market sentiment was good. Afterwards, because Yuanchengyong and Taichang sold, the price was suppressed by one tael, reaching 576.67 taels. The price then rose to 577.89 taels in just over ten minutes due to lack of arbitrage. Mitsubishi then absorbed near the oriental silver 1 tael 2 qian 5 fen 7.5. Then, the opening price reduced to around 577 taels, and the market price did not change, but immediately rose, reaching 578 taels, and the domestic market stabilized. In December, the gold banks traded with each other at 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen 125, and Fuchang went up, chasing the price. Yifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, etc. all sold, so the price jumped more than 2.5 taels to 579.7 taels, almost reaching 580 taels. Many who sold their futures took advantage of this to supply. Yuanmaoyong, Yuanxingyong, etc. sold again, causing a drop of a tael. At 10:30, it was 577 taels, and there was a hidden fluctuation of one tael afterwards. At 10:50, it was 578.5 qian. At 11:00, it was 577.78 taels. Trading on the market was limited, so there were only fluctuations of 0.04 or 0.05 taels. At noon closing, it was 577.6 taels, and then it was suppressed to 577.45 taels. The revealed price was still 615 taels, a suppression of 38 taels. Afterwards, it was 35 and 36 taels, and 37 taels at noon.</p>
<p>▲The market in the afternoon appeared mediocre. The opening price in the afternoon was 577.5 taels. Afterwards, buyers were not idle, adding to 578.67 taels. The price then fell slightly by 0.04 or 0.05 taels, reaching 578.23 taels. Then, Zhifengyong and retail buyers bought, and Mitsui bought current oriental silver 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen, so the price rose by one tael, reaching 579.1 taels at around 3:00. Suddenly, Yufengyong sold, so the supply on the market exceeded demand, and the price fell by 2.56 taels. It was rumored that Hamaguchi's injury was very dangerous, causing general panic. At 3:30, it was 576.5 taels. Afterwards, those who arbitrage sold English gold and then entered the bullion market. It is said that Zhengjin ate the distant future at 1.75 and Mitsui appeared Dalian at 1 tael 2 qian 6 fen 3125. However, the price of gold mutually increased to 578.1 taels. At 4:30 closing, it was 577.6 taels, a drop of 0.03 taels compared to last Saturday. The highest price during the day was 579.7 taels, and the lowest price was 576.5 taels, a difference of 3.2 taels. The revealed price was a suppression of more than 37 taels. The account books show 85 taels for this month, 81 taels for the next month, and 78 taels for January. The supplement was 85 taels. The spot price was 577.3 taels in the morning, 577.6 taels at noon, 577.5 taels in the afternoon, and 577.6 taels at closing.</p>
<p>▲Inconsistent deposits and withdrawals. The transactions were inconsistent. Taikangrun, Xheng, Fuxingyong, and Taichang all sold. Yuanchengyong, Yuanxingyong, Zhifengyong, and Wanxing had irregular deposits and withdrawals. Shunli, Yongfeng, Fuchang, Yu Da, Hongli, and the arbitrage all bought. Yuanmaoyong had excessive supply. In the afternoon, Zhifengyong and the arbitrage all bought, and Shunli and Wanxing also bought. Yufengyong, Hongli, Yuanchengyong, and Zhenchangxiang all sold. The other firms had occasional sales and purchases, but the volume was not smooth. The Dalian gang bought a total of 2,000 bars and sold more than 500 bars, which were arbitrage. There was also bullish hedging. The Guangdong gang still did not have a large amount of transactions.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market Sentiment Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Monday, the HSBC posted foreign exchange rates without any changes, similar to last weekend. Overseas silver markets saw a slight increase in telegrams the day before, but exchange rates remained the same. As for the bank's domestic market, the trends of English, American, and Japanese exchanges were still stable, with slight fluctuations throughout the day. The gold market also only had a fluctuation of a little over three taels. The supply and demand of each firm were different, but in the end, it was slightly smaller. From morning to night, it fluctuated within 80 taels. The result of foreign exchange compared to last Saturday, only the US dollar slightly reduced by 0.125, and the English and Japanese exchanges were not much different. There were also no large transactions among Chinese merchants. The deposits and withdrawals were unequal, with about 100,000 pounds of English gold being transacted. Banks such as Sumitomo and Korea sold, while Shanghai Zhengjin absorbed, and Fuchang sold. Each bank also made three or four thousand pounds, and the US dollar also made ten thousand pounds. The Japanese gold was sold by the Dalian gang to Mitsubishi, Mitsui, etc. for several hundred thousand dollars, but Mitsui slightly sold as well. Dongya also sold December English gold and moved into February, with a discount of 0.0625, which was done by Macgary. The market atmosphere was still stable.</p>

<h3>Initial Week Silver Dollar Market Shows Signs of Prosperity</h3>
<p>▲Market Overview The financial market atmosphere usually quiets down towards the end of the week but perks up at the beginning of the week. Yesterday happened to be one of those days, so the situation was relatively bustling. The silver market also seemed quite good, with a tightness already materializing even if not yet plentiful. The silver exchange rate, however, was unremarkable, with little chance of rising sharply or dropping significantly. As a result, it hovered around the current price and is unlikely to see any special fluctuations.</p>
<p>▲Premium Rates (Silver Premium) The morning and afternoon rates have remained consistent for several days. Yesterday was no exception, with the morning and afternoon rates both at 7 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 fen, 3 li, 7 hao and a half, which is slightly better than the previous day's rate by 2 hao and a half. (Silver Discount) Gradually trending upwards, with the morning rate at 1 jiao 8 fen and the afternoon rate at 1 jiao 9 fen. Bank rates were 7 fen. The initial rate plus water was initially 1 jiao 2 or 3 fen, then quickly around 1 jiao. The situation still looks firm.</p>
<p>▲Subsidiary Coin Market Situation The Jiangnan small silver coins remained at 6 jiao 4 fen in both the morning and afternoon, with only 2,000 jiao traded in the morning. The Guangdong small silver coins were 6 jiao 3 fen, 9 li, and 2 hao and a half in the morning, and 9 li and a half in the afternoon, slightly better than the previous day by several hao. Trading volume was 90,000 jiao in the morning and 10,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins were at 387,000 wen, better by 500 wen.</p>
<p>▲Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver Funds) Yesterday was Monday, so banks received more funds than usual. However, they also felt a shortage of capital. Chinese banks received 3.3 to 3.4 million in ticket funds, foreign banks received over 2.4 million in ticket funds, various commodity taxes and miscellaneous funds totaled over 1.1 million, special funds totaled over 1.5 million, and settlement funds totaled over 3 million. 1.5 million went into storage. Japanese banks received over 5.2 million in various funds and over 1 million in settlement funds, with 600,000 going out of storage. Money shops and silver firms received over 45.5 million in single fund receipts and over 5.3 million in dividend fund receipts, and over 1.5 million in remittance receipts from various routes, with about 1 million in cash withdrawn.

<h3>Securities: The '96 Bonds Rise by $1.50</h3>
<p>▲Whole Sixth Issue and Troops Reduction Continue to Rise Over One Dollar ▲Transaction Volume Reaches 16.4 Million</p>
<p>Yesterday, only spot trading was available for government bonds in the morning. In the afternoon, there were no transactions for any bonds. However, the futures market was very active. The 19th Issue, Customs 96, Troops Reduction, and Disbandment bonds all had large transaction volumes. The bond market environment is very good and reorganizations of old debts have already been planned, which is why, even though bond prices have risen quite high, the market is still eager to sell. However, many parties are still actively investing and buying, and bond prices continue to rise steadily. The highest price of the '96 Bonds even surpassed $25, although it eased slightly later. However, it still rose by $1.50 compared to last weekend. Disbandment bonds and the Whole Sixth Issue are also actively being purchased and have risen by several jiao compared to last week. Other bonds have also strengthened slightly, while the 19th issue of the loan bonds has slightly contracted. The total daily spot trading volume was only $3,000, while the futures trading volume reached $16.4 million.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales Show Some Improvement</h3>
<p>The actual sales of cotton yarn have improved somewhat, especially for yarn handled by the Yunnan group, but other groups have shown little activity. Therefore, although trading is brisk, confidence is not very high. This is because there is a large inventory of yarn, and the sales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn are stagnant, so sellers are calm and not eager to clear out their stock. Therefore, prices rise in the morning and weaken in the afternoon. Based on the general trend, the yarn market is unlikely to see aggressive price increases. If demand for current yarn continues to be strong, there might be a chance of a rebound of one or two taels. Otherwise, the market will likely remain range-bound.</p>
<p>▲Man Biao Cotton Yarn Fluctuates and Weakens The opening price of Man Biao cotton yarn in the morning was strong due to lingering momentum from the previous day. Prices of first and second lots rose by 3 qian. Prices in the third lot were sluggish due to the decline in raw cotton, causing all months to drop by 6 to 7 qian. Closing prices dropped by 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 qian. In the afternoon, there was news that current yarn sales were good, which slightly boosted confidence and caused prices to rise by 6 to 7 qian. However, due to negative news about American cotton, cotton prices fell sharply, dragging down the yarn market, with all months falling by 1.2 to 3 qian. The total daily transaction volume was 17,850 bales. Yongchang sold 1,000 bales, Xincheng sold 1,100 bales, Shenyu sold 1,250 bales, Gengfeng sold 1,150 bales, Hengda sold 900 bales, and others sold 300 to 400 bales. Yiyu bought 1,500 bales, Lichang bought 1,000 bales, Dafeng bought 1,050 bales, Rongxing bought 1,150 bales, Gongtai bought 800 bales, and others bought 400 to 500 bales. The closing prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Man Biao Closing Price	Change	Inventory	Man Biao Closing Price	Change	Inventory</p>
<p>February	14.58	Down 6	16,300	February	14.80	Down 5	33,800</p>
<p>December	14.65	85	25,260	March	14.90	62	22,300</p>
<p>January	14.69	73	17,150	April	14.94	71	10,600</p>
<p>▲Lao Bang's Spot Purchases are Robust. Lao Hao's Spot Yarn Sales Improve The total purchase statistics for each group for the whole day was 3,560 bales, 400 bales from the same trade, with prices up 5 qian. Among the customer groups, the Yunnan group was the most active, buying 2,450 bales.

<h3>Cotton Market Sees Major Reversal</h3>
<p>The sharp drop in cotton prices is mainly due to the fact that prices have risen for six consecutive days last week. Foreign cotton prices are weak, and the exchange rate is loose. Indian cotton combined prices are cheaper by one to two taels. However, local cotton prices have been driven up due to excessive short selling in the current month, which has led to a squeeze by buyers. As a result, forward prices have been driven up. Furthermore, the Ningbo and Shanghai groups have been aggressively purchasing in forward months, leading to a rising trend. However, Japanese and Han groups are taking advantage of this rise to sell off large quantities, totaling about 30,000 to 40,000 dan. Although futures prices have risen, spot cotton transactions in various factories remain stagnant. Japanese factories are even more inactive because they have already stocked up on cheaper Indian cotton, so they have no need to purchase more. In the afternoon, negative news about American cotton caused the market to change dramatically. The reversal was particularly severe, and many longs were fearful and sold off their positions, causing prices to trend downward across the board.</p>
<p>▲Han Biao Cotton Yarn Retreats by Four to Five Qian The opening price of Han Biao cotton yarn in the morning was calm due to the quiet American cotton market and the strong lingering momentum from the previous day. However, sales by Han and Japanese groups caused prices in all months to rise by one to two qian. During the second and third lots, long positions came out, causing the market to fall sharply, resulting in prices dropping by one to two qian in all months. In the afternoon, news of negative American cotton reports amplified the falling trend, with all months falling by two to three qian. The total daily transaction volume was 73,900 dan. Yuanda bought 3,700 dan, Dafeng bought 1,900 dan, Yukang bought 2,000 dan, Yuchang bought 2,600 dan, and others bought 1,800 to 1,900 dan. Shenchang sold 7,300 dan, Shenyu sold 2,300 dan, Yuda sold 2,100 dan, and others sold 1,500 to 1,600 dan. The closing prices are listed below.</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Downriver is Stable</h3>
<p>▲Zhabei Yesterday, various groups saw around the 30th, but sales of local new japonica rice were sluggish, with top-quality still around 15.5 yuan. Medium-quality rice needed to be reduced by nearly a jiao. Thin indica rice was stable, with a large volume opening at 14.4 yuan. Yangxian rice sales were stagnant. There was a large supply of Dujian rice, and the same was true for Shanghai xian rice. All the above-mentioned xian rices were similar to the previous day. Top-quality Dujian opened at 13.2 yuan, while customer-quality xian rice saw a price increase of two jiao due to dwindling supplies and activity from the Zhejiang group. Bianyuan Zhengbao City saw no gains or losses, with the top quality opening around 15 yuan.</p>
<p>▲South Shanghai Yesterday, more than a dozen boats arrived from downriver. Changbang white japonica rice saw some interest from customers, so high-quality goods were very popular, with top quality reaching 15 yuan. Su Tong white japonica rice sold well in both urban and rural areas, but sellers still insisted on holding onto their goods. Top-quality Tongli japonica rice was priced at 13 yuan. Transactions were not as brisk as the previous day. South Bang thin indica rice, especially top-quality goods, sold very well, so the price rose to 14 yuan. However, ordinary rice turned flat, and the overall trend was stable. Yangdu and various other xian rices all opened at 13 yuan. The price of Yinyuan rice fluctuated greatly, with high-quality goods priced at 13 yuan and lower-quality goods at only 10.7 or 8 jiao. With goods arriving continuously, people are taking a wait-and-see approach, and the market seems to be raising prices for the lower qualities.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Discovering New Low Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, huge price declines were seen in the market for all months. The price of foreign wheat from Chicago fell another 5 to 6 jiao, and Canadian wheat fell 1 yuan to 1.4 yuan. The price decline was even more pronounced abroad, and foreign firms were even more actively selling off their wheat. As a result, confidence was greatly impacted, and opening prices were unstable. Short sellers piled on top of each other, and sell-offs continued to be strong. The market now feels that there is a global oversupply of grain, which is sure to lead to price declines. Factories that have already ordered foreign wheat are increasing their selling volume in both the flour and wheat markets. Although long positions are trying to hold on, they are ultimately pressured by the environment. The attitude of the factories towards ordering foreign wheat is no longer based on need but entirely on speculation. As a result, new two- or three-year lows were seen across the board. This month fell 3 fen compared to the previous weekend, December fell 3 fen and a half, January fell 4 fen, and February, March, and April each fell 4 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market in a Sharp Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, all months were in a sharp decline due to the impact of the sharp decline in foreign wheat prices. This month opened at 4 taels and 4 qian, followed by a large sell-off by short positions. In addition, the Zhonghua Factory was selling off wildly, regardless of the market price, which led to a collapse in the market. Long positions had little power to resist. Forward months also saw a surge in selling by factories that had already ordered foreign wheat. From the opening price to the closing price, prices also fell sharply. In the current state of affairs, if the surplus goods from abroad are imported into China in large quantities, the resulting turmoil will not only affect the flour and wheat industries. The entire society will also suffer a great loss. Those with social responsibility must pay attention to this. As a result, this month fell 1 qian and 1 fen compared to the previous weekend. December and January each fell 1 qian, and February, March, and April fell 8 fen. The spot market was very quiet because of the unfavorable environment. Wheat from Qingjiangpu, Zhongguan, opened as low as 3 taels and 6 qian, totaling more than 200 bales.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice Being Moved to Beiyang</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s customer xian rice market saw arrivals of Jiangxi machine early and Hunan machine yuan rice. Nanjing machine rice had few in stock. Sales were lively to Beiyang group. The market was active. Prices for Nanjing rice rose by nearly a jiao. Jiangxi machine early and Hunan machine yuan were cheaper by one to two jiao due to large arrivals. Total sales for Hunan machine yuan rice were 750 bags, priced at 13 yuan 3 jiao and a half, 13 yuan 5 fen, to 12 yuan 8 jiao. Jiangxi machine early had 400 bags, priced at 10 yuan 1 jiao to 10 yuan. Nanjing machine rice had 100 bags, priced at 9 yuan 9 jiao and 9 fen. Other customer rice saw little in sales. However, if supplies increase in the future, the price of all rices may fall.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Shanghai Silk Factories Reopen at 23 Factories</h3>
<p>Silk factories in this port have been suspended due to sluggish sales and losses that were unsustainable. After persuasion by the Shanghai Silk Factory Association, silk factories in various districts have made efforts to resume operations. From the 12th to the 14th, a total of 23 silk factories in Shanghai have reopened. In the Hongkou district, Yuanfeng and nine other silk factories are currently reorganizing internally and recruiting workers. It is expected that they will be able to resume operations around the 19th. The remaining 70 silk factories have exhausted their funds and must wait for the government's silk industry bonds to be issued before they can restart production.</p>
<h3>Needle and Eyebrow Green Tea English Sales Become Smooth</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this port saw sales of needle and eyebrow green tea from incoming tea estates. English firms like Jardine Matheson, Jinlong, Yuansheng, and others started to purchase, and trading was not quiet. For Gongxi green tea, Russian firms also purchased as usual. However, the selling prices were very low. The zhenmei market did not see much progress, with only medium and low-quality tea estates seeing some sales. The market price fell by one to two taels. There were still 10,000 to 20,000 boxes of Qining black tea in stock. English and Russian firms generally ignored the tea due to its poor quality. The future is bleak.</p>
<h3>Paitou Market Presents a State of Rising and Falling Uncertainty</h3>
<p>▲Local Cotton Cloth Yesterday's market was still chaotic, with fine cloth even weaker. Blue Flying Fish fell by 7.5 fen, and Color Ball Yang He Blue Double Fish fell by 2.5 fen. Blue Chicken was only sold at 6 taels and 3 qian. However, the fine twill fabric turned around slightly yesterday. Yang He continued to rise by 5 fen, and Blue Double Fish also strengthened due to the addition of Guangdong group purchases. Coarse cloth was most active with 9-pound goods. Ningbo, Wenzhou, and other groups bought large quantities. The inland route in this street was also uninterrupted, so spot goods were in short supply. 11-pound goods were slightly weak. Yesterday, 2.5 fen, 16-pound coarse twill 5 yuan to sell. 14-pound rent-a-tower spot goods were lacking. 12-pound three fish and three rabbits fell slightly.</p>
<p>▲East and West Paitou Markets See Mixed Gains and Losses, and there is Uncertainty The price of East Goods' Double Dragon Water Wave velvet rose by 2.5 li yesterday because the Han group has been adding orders for days, reaching more than 200 pieces. Therefore, the spot goods on the market are not as abundant as before. The morning price was still 2 qian and 7 li and a half, but in the afternoon it was 2 qian and 1 fen. The subsequent step still needs to rise. The price of color stripe velvet was uniformly sold at 6 taels and 8 qian yesterday, but the decline of fine serge continued. Huxinting sold 3 qian, Huanle 2 qian, 9 fen and 7 li and a half. Sanyou's Tu Yuan was 3 qian yesterday. Many are willing to sell. Only the Fuhua of Zhonghua and the Wakayama of Xiaohua for Yuehua velvet rose by 2.5 li due to the addition of customer group purchases. The rest are still lacking a turnaround. Sixteen-foot yuan velvet for West Goods is in short supply. The goods that arrived before have mostly been sold, and later Zhuang have not yet arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Wujin Huisi Iron Continues to Increase</h3>
<p>The Huisi iron market has been trending upwards for days due to insufficient supply. We previously reported on this matter. Yesterday, there were telegrams from Hong Kong, Toyo, and other places requesting purchases, which made the trend even better. The market has a great potential for further growth. Prices are as follows: Mitsui goods are sold at 20 taels and 5 qian, Meikang goods are sold at 23 taels and 5 qian, Fengyu goods are sold at 23 taels and 7 qian and a half, and miscellaneous brands are sold at 22 taels and 7 qian and a half. Investigations show that as many as 700 to 800 boxes were opened yesterday, but the market inventory is getting thinner, and confidence is even stronger. The market price may continue to rise.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Sophora Flower New Crop Fails</h3>
<p>The new crop of sophora flowers has failed, and there is a shortage of supply. Market prices are increasing steadily. According to Tianjin telegrams, the price is 4 to 5 yuan, equivalent to about 5.7 or 8 qian in Shanghai standard, which is not cost-effective. Goods from Yantai and Qingdao also require 4 taels to 4 taels and a half. The current market price here is 4 taels and 8 qian to 5 taels and 1 qian, and the market price may reach 6 to 7 taels in the future. Investigations show that there are only about a thousand packages in stock. The Zhenbang firms are holding tight and not selling, asking for 6 taels. They regard it as a life-saving commodity, and the trend is tight.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Sand White Gradually Declining</h3>
<p>▲Cuban Red Opens at Over 3,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market production area telegrams stated that the current sugar price in Cuba is 1.500, which is up 3125 compared to the previous telegram. New York sugar futures for December are 1.40, March of next year are 1.53, May are 1.60, and September are 1.73, with no ups or downs. Association market transactions were quiet. Dutch sugar #24 coarse sand white was weaker, and the price fell again. The transaction price was 7 taels and 6 qian and a half. Those who did not ship out their newly arrived goods immediately were quoted at 7 taels and 6 qian. The market shape was weak and lacked vitality. Medium sugar white was 7 taels and 7 qian and a half, and #20 medium sand white was 6 taels and 8 qian, with little interest. Dutch red #8 was 6 taels and 2 qian and a half, and the market was stable. Japanese sugar transactions were sparse.

<h3>Impressions of a Northern Journey</h3>
<p>— Su Ling</p>
<p>(Twenty-three) Wandering Alone in Dalian City</p>
<p>Stepping out of the small room prepared for me by Lao Yang, what unfolded before my eyes was a streetscape displaying the filth and inferiority of the Chinese populace, a collection of complex smells, a gray, chaotic accumulation. But after I passed through this section of the city, a fresh scene spread out before me: smooth and clean roads, interesting water features, residences, small green trees... This was Seitoku Street, where the Japanese lived.</p>
<p>The area around the Tokiwa Bridge Chain Street is the center of metropolitan Dalian. Although there are no towering buildings, the streets with their decorative flair evoke a modern poetic sentiment.</p>
<p>So I passed through the quiet, shaded road again and walked into the park. Ponds, pavilions, dry trellises, broken wooden benches, shallow grass, small stone bridges... These are perfect for a Japanese girl in large sleeves and wooden sandals, leisurely, like the taste of eyes behind a shoji screen.</p>
<p>The other Electrical Amusement Park is also like this, with its趣味化 arrangement of small pebble paths, stone-railed bridges, small slopes, and plains of shallow grass... But this park has many animal enclosures and pools and cages for birds. There are more visitors than in the park, even though it costs five Japanese cents.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this park, there is a "Wooden Fish Temple," which displays all kinds of ancient and modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean wooden fish (the percussion instrument used by monks), more than four hundred in total. Some are very large, some are extremely small. The extremely small ones are toys rather than used by monks. They are made of various woods, metals, jade, bones, shells, and artificial materials.</p>
<p>Leaving the Electrical Amusement Park...</p>
<p>In Xigang, just like Wansui Street near my residence, there are rows and rows of Chinese brothels. Each house is marked with a number. This reminds me of the brothels in Harbin and Jilin. That was extremely interesting. They were probably government-run, specially constructed as round, castle-like buildings arranged in a circle, with a pavilion in the middle and four large gates facing all directions. It's called "Circle Building." But Korean brothels write things like "Pavilion," "Building," "Cuisine," while Russian brothels have no signs. Low-class, goblin-like women stand outside the door to solicit customers.</p>
<p>After passing through Xigang, I took the tram back to my residence to wait for Lao Yang to return from the newspaper office so we could prepare to see Dalian at night.</p>
<h3>Huang Jinwu's Nostalgic Tune</h3>
<p>— Xiao Youmei</p>
<p>"In Memoriam" Overture to be performed by the Shanghai Municipal Orchestra at the Great Light Cinema on the evening of the 23rd of this month.</p>
<p>Speaking of Chinese music, it truly breaks our hearts. Kretzschmad, the president of the Berlin University of Music in Germany, said, "Even if a country has excellent musical performers, if it does not have good musical composers, it ultimately cannot be said to exist in the international music scene." When people around the world talk about music, they completely disregard China. Why is this?</p>
<p>Everyone who knows the slightest bit about the immensity of the world knows that musical composition is an extremely difficult task. Simply studying harmony and composition cannot be said to make one a composer. Even being able to set lyrics to music cannot be said to make one a composer. Why? Music has its own independent life. Therefore, you must break free from the limitations of words and create purely musical works. I make a firm judgment: a musician who cannot compose orchestral works, even if he creates remarkable songs, cannot be said to be a complete composer.</p>
<p>Because I have this understanding of musical composition, I dare not neglect the creation of orchestral works in addition to engaging in musical education. I am not trying to steal the title of composer for my own amusement, but because I believe that if a country simply does not have the creation of orchestral works, then everyone will admit that this is a national disgrace. It is truly disheartening. Although I have been very concerned about whether orchestral works have been produced in China for more than ten years, the result has always been disappointing. Unexpectedly, this time I have the opportunity to see Mr. Huang Jinwu's Nostalgic Tune. Excellent! My ten years of longing have now become a reality. Therefore, I am happy to introduce Mr. Huang Jinwu's orchestral work to all Chinese gentlemen who care about music.</p>
<p>The author, Mr. Huang Jinwu, told me that this is a trial work of his first orchestral piece, which is used to commemorate his girlfriend, Ms. Hu Yongfu, who has passed on to the heavens. It is also a result of Huang's study of music at Yale University in the United States. This time, he also showed me a review from a newspaper there. The newspaper featured a photo of Huang and said that Yale University usually selects the three best works from student works for the annual year-end music concert, and the one composed by that twenty-five-year-old youth—that is, Huang—was the best. This was in May 1929. Huang, who is young and energetic, achieved such valuable results in his first attempt. Isn't his future achievement limitless? Now, I will analyze the structure of Huang's Nostalgic Tune in general terms as follows:</p>
<p>This piece is in G minor and is divided into five major sections: (1) Introduction, (2) Opening Section, (3) Development Section, (4) Closing Section, (5) Coda. The entire piece is created from a very simple musical phrase. The simple and melancholic tune played by the cello and double bass in unison at the beginning of the introduction is the clue to the entire piece.</p>
<p>The opening phrase of the opening section is also an incarnation of this main musical phrase. However, in this section, it is an intense and tragic tune rather than a dull sound. The following phrase of the opening section transitions to B-flat major, which is a very soft and graceful tune. It is first played solo by the clarinet and oboe, accompanied by the extremely light and clear accompaniment of the string instruments. Later, the string instruments also join in playing the main melody and create an interesting response with the wind instruments. The closing phrase of the opening section contains some religious meaning. A simple melody is played by the wind instruments above, and the accompanying string instruments below use pizzicato to play a very clever "ground bass." Finally, the viola returns to the main musical phrase, and the tremolo on the drums adds a lot of sorrow.</p>
<p>The development section first elaborates on the main musical phrase, undergoing various complex changes and modulations of semitones. Suddenly, it transitions to the loudest C major. At this time, the brass instruments, like singing a triumphal song, play the following phrase of the opening section extremely magnificently. This majestic tune is as bright as the clouds parting and the sun rising. After the majestic tune, a charming tune follows, played by the flute and oboe, accompanied by the crisp arpeggios of the celesta. The musical intention of this section is also derived from the following phrase of the opening section. Then, the instruments respond to each other, gradually strengthening until the climax of the entire piece. From there, it gradually weakens and enters the fourth section.</p>
<p>The sections of the closing section are largely the same as the previous opening section, but are generally slightly more complex than before. For example, in the opening phrase, in addition to the celesta playing the previous main phrase, the wind instruments also create various free cyclic counterpoints based on new musical ideas. In the following phrase, what was originally a solo performance by the wind instruments has become a cyclic piece played by wind and string instruments in unison. The closing phrase also adds a section played by brass instruments, with simple chords imitating the few sections of a large organ in a church, thus intensifying the religious meaning.</p>
<p>The coda is still derived from the original main musical phrase, but now in C major. The previously dark and melancholic tune has suddenly turned into a bright and comforting song. The solo violin in the extremely high register makes people imagine the author's deceased friend singing sacred songs in the upper realm to comfort him, while the heavier viola plays a strict cyclic counterpoint in the lower register, a call and response between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Judging from the overall structure, this is naturally a work that takes after the modelist school. Its flavor is somewhat similar to Brahms. Who doesn't know that the music of the modelist school is not the latest musical art. Originally, it is the most difficult thing to create a system of one's own. I know that Mr. Huang will not be complacent because of this. With Huang's youth and energy, and such rare musical talent, after a period of hard study, he will surely be able to create a brand-new system of his own, and win some glory for our China in the international music scene. Huang is the first person in our country to obtain a music degree from an American university music school. Because I admire Huang's talent and learning, I specially hired him as the Director of Academic Affairs and Professor of Music Theory at the National Conservatory of Music. Because his Nostalgic Tune was also praised by Mr. Pa, the conductor of the Municipal Orchestra, it was specially included in the program of the public performance on the evening of November 23 this year. This is the first time that a Chinese orchestral work has had the opportunity to be publicly performed in a Shanghai orchestra led by foreigners. Isn't this also something that all patriotic Chinese gentlemen should be most happy about?</p>
