<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本之海約與預算</h3>
<p>英美日三國之當前兩問題一爲批准海約。一爲編製預算皆爲不易解决之事。今英國之政府預算案。已通過於下院。美國之倫敦海約亦已通過參院而經總統批准。是英美對此兩問題已减去糾紛不少矣。而獨於日本。對此兩問題之糾紛依然尙在。此何以故。以日本政府之組織其制較英美爲繁密權限又多牽掣而各要人間因身分之異歷史上又多捍格。故每因一問題而牽動多方。如今日之海約預算。樞府與政府間政府與海部間海部與軍令部間意見旣不能一致。而在野之政黨與資本家之領袖。主張又每與政府異。一問題而欲得多方面之諒解。勢豈易能此日本之問題。所以較英美尤難解决也。再以日本之現狀言之。其所處地位。依軍事家主張。確有不能不擴張軍備之勢。而政府之財政。則因收入銳減一切事業。實將無法維持。况又加以從來未有之不景氣。人民方面。憤政府之不爲救濟攻擊政府之無能。而軍人派之對於國防計劃。又堅持不稍通融。政府當局旣有此事實上之困難。而又加以各方面意見之紛歧。故其處理實亦較英美爲尤難也。</p>
<p>據此情勢以觀。微論海約與預算兩問題。無法解决。將陷政府於危殆。即幸而經多人調停之力。得以勉强通過。亦難保不於他問題發生糾紛。蓋有此根本上之困難。無論如何長才有爲之政府。均不易善其後矣。</p>

<p>自由談付之一笑海客男　　丨吾愛。你的貎愈長愈美了。眞敎人看了再要看。女丨我是利用西方的一種美容法。每天只吃棕色麵包和水。不吃别的東西。男丨你何必爲了美貎如此吃苦。女丨可以多得男子們的追求。男丨不必了。我們今天訂婚吧。　　藥店主顧丨你們這裏有甚麼良好的咳嗽藥麼。藥劑師丨我勸你買這一種咳嗽藥水。這是我自己發明的。藥店主顧丨請把這藥水的好處說與我聽聽。藥劑師丨别的不必說。我自已也有咳嗽的毛病。二十年來單服藥水。至今還在服下去。别的藥我是不相信的。甲丨聽說你已將那廚娘辭歇了。是不是。乙丨是的。甲丨你這廚娘做菜做得很好。我曾吃過幾回。怎麼把伊辭歇呢。乙丨只爲伊做菜做得太好。天天總有親戚朋友到我們這裏來吃飯。我無力擔負。只索請伊走了。誌吳姫陳之血戰　　寄涯　　吳姬陳者。爲吳起陣之誤。聞古名將吳起曾在此設帳構陣也。地在杞縣東郭外。杞爲馮部精銳吉鴻昌所守。外有極堅固之工作。攻取頗感不易。國軍第六師素以常勝著稱。前次北伐時。追奔逐北。轉戰數千里。渡河一擊。底定大局者。亦惟第六師能勝此任。今茲中央討伐閻馮。第六師首由信陽進駐確山。未幾兼程北上。直撲杞縣。遇悍敵吉鴻昌部於吳起陣。血戰即行爆發。爲奪吳起陣彈丸之地。激戰凡八晝夜。砲火震天。殺聲動地。得失數次。屍橫遍野。正所謂一將功成萬骨枯也。初馮知第六師將北上。使吉鴻昌率部南下。禦於周口。及旣至。知第六師已星夜北發。遂旋踵而返。據杞以待。吉爲馮部精銳。人數約有二三萬。大刀隊爲其特别編制。衝鋒陷陣。均以大刀爲唯一武器。雖槍林彈雨。不能减其銳進。非久慣征塲之第六師以當之。鮮不望風披靡其爲戰也。銜刀蛇行於麥隴中。使人聲息不聞。一至近前。突起猛砍。哨兵偶不留意。頭顱往往如瓜落。彼則深入營地。橫搠直砍以去。第六師據守吳起陣時。曾有一次被其闖入。幸發覺甚早。羣起巷戰自午夜以至天明。二三百大刀隊之生還者。百不得一。而第六師之神勇。遂爲馮部所聞風喪膽矣。吳起陣之南爲韓莊。突出於戰線之前第六師派兵二十駐守。是處僅矮屋三楹。孤峙田野間。敵藐視之。以爲此二十人者。何異羊落虎口。擬生擒之以爲快。來敵百餘人。施以包圍。守兵初不爲動。俟其來。遽以機槍掃射。則此百餘人中兎脫生還者。不及二十人。敵經此巨創。猛施砲火。擬殲此守兵。以圖報復。發砲千餘。房屋已燬於火。而此二十人又復穴土以居。絕無懼色。第六師之名於以大著。日前友軍俘獲敵兵五六名。詢其何不向第六師攻擊。而屢擾我方。曰長官以六師難動。禁勿輕犯。其畏之如虎也如此。第六師師長爲趙觀濤。副師長爲邢震南。均爲善戰之將。平時瀟洒自如。工詩書。有儒將風。御下嚴明。賞罰必公。所至之地。秋毫無犯。虞紙幣之不便於豫地也設法兌換現洋。防頑兵之擾鄕民也。置櫃任人告發。益以精明之參謀長周碞。勤敏之參謀處長張琪。全師軍紀。有條不紊。以是所至受人歡迎。軍得民助。無怪其每戰必勝矣。中暑騐方青萍　　際茲茲盛夏烈日之下。中暑倒斃者。時有所聞。爰錄騐方一則。以告世之樂善者。避暑錄話云。道路城市間。中暑昏仆而死者。此皆虛人勞人。或飢飽失節。或素有疾。一爲暑氣所中。不得泄。則關竅窒皆。非暑氣使然。氣閉塞而死也。大蒜一握。道上土。雜研爛以新水和之。濾其滓。刔其齒灌之。有頃即甦。瘦鐵喪偶記賀天健　　寳鏡缺。鯤弦折。人間至不幸而至痛心之事也。吾友錢子瘦鐵與韓女士步伊結褵三年零二月。善畫同趣。金石盟心。郎旣多才。女亦尙藝。佳偶也。方其始也形影不離。起臥相與。友輩所期。宜其百年偕老。而未料其鶼折鴛分在此一彈指間耳。可不哀哉。韓女士名秀字步伊。曹娥江籍而生長於雲間者。幼通詩書。喜書畫。美豐儀。有雲間美人之名。二十而歸瘦鐵。時瘦鐵方游黃山歸。由孫子雪泥撮合。瘦鐵一見。即曰此誠吾妻也。文定甫畢。即涓吉迎歸。女士歸後。以婚事過舖張。而於日常之需。宜從節儉。於是親盥滌而事烹飪。鴻案相莊。禮至備矣。暇則日臨張遷曹娥諸碑。頗得其神似。作畫在石濤兩峯之間。幽秀奇恣。别具一格。海上藝苑同人。無不重其才而高其品。去年隨其夫東游。東瀛人士以爲支那女畫家中第一流人也。墨痕流傳。值重兼金。至今寳之。橋本關雪。東瀛畫界中老前輩也。尤亟重之。其時夫人病肺已屆初期。而身適有孕。東人有勸其去孕以保元神者。而夫人笑置之。以爲無足慮也。詎今春產後。神虧氣損。而病入膏盲矣。以滬居不宜。遷歸母家。瘦鐵隨侍松江。跬步不離。詎竟醫藥罔效。延至日前乃以溘逝聞。嗚呼人孰無情。能不痛心。佛氏所謂世界缺陷。豈誠缺陷耶。余與瘦鐵交。契逾手足。每至其家。而夫人不以外客視余。余亦遇食即食。無所顧忌。所不能去懷者。夫人知余工仕女而不輕作。婚後即要余爲畫仕女一幀。余則勞人草草。年復一年。迄未報命。早知如此。余豈誠不輕作。隨處皆可著筆也。而今使殁者永有遺憾。可不痛哉。聞瘦鐵言。夫人在去世之前二日。潛詰乳媼日歷。曰吾於二十五日恐有變矣。屬弗宣之他人。屆日忽起易服理妝。瘦鐵不知也。未幾下睡。忽復呼曰瘦鐵。更不能作他語。蓋心碎而腸斷矣。爾時門外適有絲竹聲過。瘦鐵知有變。即謀急救。已不及。而能書善畫之女士。已與其良人作永遠之别離矣。嗚呼。（却酬）江北匪氛之一斑紅綃　　因報端屢有匪訊。乃使我聯憶及於宋毅父仁弟在如臯石家莊擊退共匪事。宋任石家莊公安分局長。兼警察中隊長。我初不之知。蓋睽别將一載。未嘗通隻字也。數星期前。宋由任所送眷歸杭。道出春江。不期然相值於途。因同赴酒家買醉。飲次。爲余談江北匪氛之熾。較去年又進。其人數之衆多。無可統計。匪之大本營所在地。幾於民匪不分。一旦嘯聚。則平時儼然善良之農民。皆爲匪也。石家莊爲如臯第十二分局。有警察約二百人。宋昔隸二十一師嚴重部爲參謀。頗富於軍事學識。故到任後。知匪氛險惡。必有來犯之日。對於警察。完全施以軍事訓練。夙夜不懈。與他處警察之但具形式者逈異某日。匪果大舉來犯。人數達千以上然祗約六百人有槍械。餘悉執火把。作縱火焚舍之用。商民聞訊。慄慄大懼。宋則鎭定如常。從容率警迎戰於郊。酣鬥終日。匪雖衆。仍不支而退。死傷近百。而警察則僅死五六人。傷十餘人耳。是役也。商民皆以爲衆寡懸殊。料難克敵。全鎭將遭茶毒。而不圖警察竟大獲全勝也。匪無制服。惟腿臂束紅布。以爲標識。一望而知爲共匪。據宋談。共匪勢力之雄厚。殊不可侮。在江北者爲第某軍。軍長名氏。尠有知者。即宋亦無從探悉。凡在其勢力範圍内之地方。但能服從。轉可安居樂業。富有者則受害不淺。佃戶盡免其租。僅納稅共匪機關而已。職是之故。頗得農民歡心。其來犯石家莊也。初不以警察爲意。儼操勝劵。警察曾於遺屍中搜得印信一顆。及布告一大束。可見其心目中視石家莊若無人也。又匪衆敗退時。死傷者皆背負以去。遺留之屍。不及什二三。此亦可異之點。宋知其必不能甘。仍將來犯。故防之愈勤。地方商民。亦甚惴惴。一般殷實富戶。咸謀他遷。宋之夫人返杭。亦即以來犯之日。受驚過甚。不敢再留其地云。東游心影（十）（七）錢華　　（十）（四）日人之棒球狂　　日人對於各種運動。以棒球一項。最爲舉國上下所歡迎。雖三尺之童亦均能熟誦棒球規則。街頭巷尾。時見三數頑童。持球投擊。練習手法。其情形正與我國兒童酷好足球相同。日人嘗謂中菲三國。菲島承美之遺風。對於籃球技術。最爲出神入化。是以籃球爲國技者也。中國素重足球。銅頭鐵脚。賦有天才。遠朿運動會中連獲七次錦標。是以足球爲國技者也。至日本年來棒球技術在東亞諸國中已可謂登峯造極。曾遠征棒球發源地之美國。亦復有極優良之成績。中菲萬非敵手。是以棒球爲國技云云。日本棒球戰史中。以每年春秋二季。東京六大學之棒球賽最爲激烈。所謂東京六大學者。即早稻田。慶應。明治。法政。立敎。及帝國大學六隊是。比賽採雙循環制。本年春季賽於四月十二日開始。至五月二十日始告結束。亘有餘之大戰。結果上屆遠東代表慶應大學隊繼續保持錦標。比賽地點在明治神宮外苑之棒球塲。（即遠東運動會塲址）場可容七萬人。歷次球戰。均有人满之患。六大學之實力以慶應。早稻田。明治爲强。比賽之初。慶應首遇勁敵明治大學。初賽以十對九勝。次賽以二對四受挫。而早稻田則一帆風順。連敗法政及帝大。其後早稻出復勝明治。遂早稻田則一帆風順。連敗法政及帝大。其後早稻出復勝明治。遂造成鼎立之局面。記者抵東京時。適爲棒球戰最爲緊張之秋。社會人士凡相交談。莫不以球戰消息爲資料。街市間各商店之玻櫃廣告。满懸棒球戰之照片。各報除以大字刋載戰况外。復盡量採訪戰外新聞。集合零星材料。作有統系之報告。以迎合讀者之心理。以日人對棒球之狂如此。而六大學戰之激烈又如彼。於是發生塲地不能容納觀衆問題。初門票係當日在棒球塲發售。比賽於下午二時開始。上午九時售票。淸晨五時起觀衆即接踵而至。以到者先後爲序。列隊如長蛇陣。按次購票。至七萬張門票售罄爲止。而後至者多半向隅。以日人之守秩序。及警察之維持。故先後不能臘等一步。心上温馨（二）（四）（四）包天笑　　第十三回　是誰種福無意鑽得環　惟此因緣有心歌金縷　　左詩晨想。。那十張券不要遺失了嗎。。前天時觀平那裏取來時。。不是好像塞在長衫口袋内的嗎。。怎麼現在没有呢。。旣而一想。。長衫已經換了一件咧。。長衫裏的東西。。在臨洗的時候。。他夫人一定給他揀了出來。。安放在他的書桌抽屜裏了。。因爲左詩晨長衫口袋裏。。或是馬甲口袋裏。。常是塞得满满地。。好比是一個文書包。。儘有許多無用之物。。也保存在那裏。。往往到臨洗的當兒。。也不自己檢點一過。。及至忽然想起。。便急得要命。。所以他的夫人。。常常說他們的衣袋。。便是他們隨身的字紙簏。。可是雖然是字紙簏。。也不敢抛棄。。不管他有用没有用。。一古腦兒給他保存在那裏。。明知其爲無用的字紙。。也留存在那裏。。讓他自己檢點。。因此左詩晨一摸自己的口袋裏没有。。知道是在家裏了。。便向電話裏的時觀平道。。我的券在家裏没有帶出來。。時觀平道。。我現在派馬車來接你。。在我的二百張劵内。。却有一個二彩在内。。但是問問其餘的人。。號數都不對。。我疑心在你的十張券裏。。左詩晨道。。也許在李蘭馨的十張劵裏。。也未可知。。時觀平道。。我已問過了。。連龍紫耘的那二十張劵。。也已問過了。。都没有這個號頭。。請你坐了我的馬車。。回到府上去取了那劵。。到張家花園來。。我雖不曾把分派出去的劵。。一張張記下號頭來。。却是約略記得是在你的十張裏呢。。左詩晨道。。不是尋開心吧。。時觀平道。。决不尋開心。。快來快來。。因爲他們在這裏陳列的珍品。。過了今天。。就結束了。。所有得了獎的人。。希望立刻將奬品取了去。。就没有他們的事了。。左詩晨答應待馬車來後。。乘便到家裏取了那劵。。就到張園去。。一回兒功夫。。馬車便來了。。左詩晨乘着馬車。。回到家裏。。問他的夫人。。可曾見前日換下的長衫袋裏。。有幾張種福券嗎。。他夫人道。。長衫裏的字紙簏。。都没有抛棄。。一總都在長桌抽屜裏。。爲甚的急急忙忙來尋這東西做什麼呢。。左詩晨道。。剛纔時先生在張園打電話來。。說我的十張券裏。。有一個號頭。。是有二彩的希望。。他敎我帶了那券。。到張家花園去。。他夫人道。。眞的嗎。。二彩是什麼東西呢。。左詩晨道。。這個我也不知道。。於是他夫人也帮助他來尋那十張種福券。。可是把書桌抽屜倒翻了。。也找不出什麼種福券來。。</p>

<p>汽車新聞專論上海之汽車統計沛甘　　汽車事業大體優良依據上海公共租界工部局警務處。及法租界工部局警務處之兩車務處。所發表之統計而言。目下汽車實業之現象。大體上甚屬優良。即在汽車經售商視之。亦謂其業之甚有起色。蓋對於上海及中國各地之前途大半抱有樂觀耳。據滬上某鉅商言。十年之前。投資於此土者。較之目前相去誠不可以道里計。其後因凡百事業日就振興。金融起色前途克展。華洋人民均覺汽車一物。爲日常所不可或缺者。並不以奢移品視之矣。汽車實業之根基因之愈趨鞏固。又謂近十年來。新式建築之路。其增加有百分之一千。所希望者。上海至杭州之大道。能於最短期間竣工。則滬人士駕駛取樂之機會。當更多也。另一汽車經售商言。近來兌匯問題影響於汽車銷售。自非淺鮮。不過金銀比率如有一定標準。則所慮亦可續漸消滅。馴至新定之眞金錢貨位確定後。則公衆之購買車輛。勢必增加。殆可斷言也。以官報統計分析視之。汽車。運貨車。及機器脚踏車。三種摩托車輛之註册數。較之四月中第一星期所發表之數目。實質上增加甚鉅。一九三零年三月三十一日。註册數一二、三三八輛。上星期兩租界之汽車數則爲一二、八三四輛。是以三個月中之增加額爲四百九十六輛。而每個人心中均有營業慘落之意也。此數之中。其七、八五九輛屬於公共租界。四、九七五輛。則屬之於法租界。　　汽車註册數中。大半自屬於客車。其中包括私用及公用兩種。公用之客車其數逾千。五、六零六輛屬於公共租界。三、六九八輛則屬於法租界。其總數爲九三、零四輛。三個月前。九、零三八輛汽車付工部局以車捐焉。摩托運貨車之統計頗顯有趣味之變遷。七月一日公共租界與法租界兩方面之註册數爲二、八二七輛。一九</p>
<p>Page 26</p>
<p>三零年四月一日則爲二七零七兩、較之前數增加一百二十輛。運貨汽車亦分私用與公用兩種。兩種之增加數。可謂平均。機器脚踏車之增加。在公共租界自五零八輛增加至六一三輛。法租界自八十五輛增加至九十輛。增加數之所以甚多者當由於春夏兩季之氣候。蓋在此時期中駕駛自由車者自較衆多也。　　美國製造之汽車。在上海最佔多數。念三種之牌號中。註册者逾百。其十六種牌號均屬於美國。冠首之中四種爲英國汽車。法國佔兩種。意大利一種。飛霞脫是也。照前期統計言。别克車冠居班首。福特雖有壓倒之意而尙不及。别克車計九九二輛。福特九零七輛。雪佛蘭居第三位計六五七輛。馬立司考萊第四計五二二輛。飛霞脫居第五。計四七五輛。司蒂倍克直追其後計四五三輛。雪鐵龍居第七位四零八輛。自此而下更無逾四百之數者矣。　　各種汽車牌號之中。其足以驚人者。厥爲利拿爾士之註册者。較黑潑麻皮爾爲多。其增加之數自四月一日開始。利拿爾士現佔第十五位。黑潑麻皮爾則跌至第十六位。利拿爾士車之式樣。甚有較黑潑麻皮爾爲低次者。亦堪研究也。歐司金車低落亦甚。居第二十位。馬立司車無出租僱用者。此則馬立司車主堪以引爲欣慰者也。此外各種著名之汽車。除標準牌外。均得於公用之客車中見之。　　别克車之數雖爲滬上各種汽車之領袖。然福特車如包括運貨車而言。則其數爲滬上汽車之最多者矣。其總數爲一·六八二輛是也。别克居第二位。雪佛蘭第三位。九百四十二輛。馬立司第四有八百七十八輛。司蒂華運貨車三百零六輛。利拿爾士一百卄七輛。汽車之數旣如上述。不過其營業之數目若何殊難查考。因除上海之車輛外其以前未註册者甚多。更在外埠則政府機關。軍事所用在在甚多。一時不克統計耳。　　下表示上海馬路上。各種流行之客用及運貨汽車數。一九三零年四月一日。公共租界方面。私用客車四、八六五輛。公用客車五五一輛。私用運貨車七三一輛。公用運貨車八四八輛。機器脚踏車五零八輛。法租界方面私用客車三、一四七輛。公用客車四七五輛。私用運貨車六五四輛。公用運貨車四七四輛。機器脚踏車八五輛。一九三零年七月一日。公共租界方面。私用客車五、零四六輛。公用客車五六零輛。私用運貨車七七一輛。公用運貨車八六九輛。機器脚踏車六一三輛。法租界方面。私用客車。三、二一四輛。公用客車。四八四輛。私用運貨車六九零輛。公用運貨車四九七輛。機器脚踏車尤十輛。流行之汽車（牌名）　　　　（私用）　（公用）　（合計）　　　　　　　　　别克　　　　　　八四八　　一四四　　九九二福特　　　　　　七五一　　一五六　　九○七雪佛蘭　　　　　四五七　　二○○　六五七馬立司考萊　　　五二二　　丨亅　　五二二飛霞脫　　　　　四七一　　四　　　四七五司蒂倍克　　　　四○八　　四五　　四五三雪鐵龍　　　　　四○○　　八　　　四○八奥司汀　　　　　三五三　　二　　　三五五道琪　　　　　　二六五　　九一　　三五六愛山克水　　　　三一六　　二六　　三四二納喜　　　　　　二七一　　四九　　三二○馬立司奥克司福　二七二　　丨亅　　二七二灰百脫　　　　　一八七　　五四　　二四一克雷司勒　　　　一九七　　三三　　二三○黑潑麻皮爾　　　一七二　　四三　　二一五利拿脫士　　　　二一八　　一　　　二一九勒克倍　　　　　一一一　　一四　　一二五哇浮蘭　　　　　一一四　　八　　　一二二司坦逹達　　　　　二二○　　丨丨　　一二零歐司金　　　　　八七　　　三一　　一一八潑萊茂司　　　　四七　　　七○　　一一七哇爾特司麻皮而　九七　　　一一　　一○八旁推克　　　　　九四　　　九　　　一○三　　流行之運貨汽車福特　　　　　四六八輛　二零七輛　六七五輛司底華脫　　　五九　　　二四七　　三零六雪佛蘭　　　　一三七　　一四八　　二八五利拿爾士　　　六四　　　六三　　　一二七番特雷爾　　　三二　　　五九　　　九一唐乃克老夫　　七五　　　一四　　　八九其愛姆西　　　二四　　　六三　　　八七鐵玲司底文士　丨丨　　　七三　　　七三萬國　　　　　三七　　　三六　　　六七道琪　　　　　一九　　　三七　　　五六達蒙　　　　　一一　　　三九　　　五零加福　　　　　一八　　　三一　　　四九馬立司　　　　四三　　　五　　　　四八搿萊哈　　　　二二　　　二一　　　四三共和　　　　　二四　　　一七　　　四一消息讀廣州市汽車統計後　悟非廣州一市汽車事業之發達。雖次於滬漢平津四市。而較之其他區域。實有過之。近閱新出版之廣州市第一回市政統計中。關於汽車業之各種統計。覺有披露本刋之必要。爰錄而出之。用覘廣州市汽車業之近况。且督促其一致進焉。　　各種汽車之製造國别　行駛廣州市之汽車。類多購自國外。有普通自由車·運貨汽車·長途搭客汽軍·三種。其普通自由車之購自美國及加拿大者四一四輛。意大利者二四輛。英國者二○輛。法國者五輛。德國者三輛。其他一二輛。共四七八輛。運貨汽車之購自美國及加拿大者四四輛。英國者五輛。其他二輛。共五一輛。長途搭客汽車前於美國及加拿大者五○輛。意大利二輛。英國五輛。法國共計五七輛。合而計之。吾國之向國外購用汽車者。以美國爲最多。利爲所奪。年有鉅額。觀此製造國别之統計。則國内汽車界。宜如何注意而思自造國產汽車以挽回權利乎。　　汽車失愼傷人統計　查市政統計所列。二九八頁至三○○頁中。所載有十七年度與十八年度。一月至六月。汽車失愼之次數。與傷害人數之統計。在十七年度。汽車失愼次數爲二○六次。死亡人數男爲五人。女爲二人。重傷人數男爲十七人。女爲四人。微傷人數男爲一九九人。女爲四二人。在十八年僅一月至六月耳。其失愼次數爲一二五次。死亡人數男女各二人。重傷人數。男爲十一人。女爲四人。微傷人數男爲一一五人。女爲二六人。合計一六○人。試一比較。則汽車失愼與傷害人數。逐漸增多。殊非汽車界與地方之福。故在司機方面。應如何格外謹愼。以期旅客之安全。管理方面。應如何嚴加注意。以期事業之進展。否則在汽車公司。時遭失愼。修理需費。徒受重大之損失。在行人商賈。時受傷害。禍肇意外。發生不良之結果。蓋亦事之至不幸者也。　　長途汽車公司之調查　廣州市除普通自由車運貨汽車不計外。經營長途汽車業之公司。有利行·利民·模範·國民·道行·廣安·福利·粤東·利安·東安·交通等十一家公司。其承辦之年月雖有先後。而期限多者三年。少者一年。至其車輛數目。在利行·利民·模範·國民·四公司均有五輛。道行·福利·有十輛歸東有六輛。利安七輛。交通四輛。以東安爲最多。餘有三十輛。其每輛之日餉。亦甚不一。要以行駛路線之短長。與營業狀况之盛衰而定日餉之多寡。均少者僅一元六角。多者百四十七元。中間在二十三元以下。與在十元以上者亦有數公司。其下則爲六元以上與四元以上者更是不等。觀此在廣州一市之經營長途汽車等。同時競爭古玩有十一家公司之多。雖行駛之路隊不同。而同行嫉妬。容未能免。故在市政之塲論。長途汽車同應督促進行。以期交爲通通益便。而日餉一項。似宜增其收入以裕餉源。尤應寬其催徵以原厚力。在汽車公司方面言。當如何謀旅客之安全。道路之平坦。傷害之減少。事機之小心。而期營業之發達也。　　查市政統計中關於汽車事項。固不僅此三者而已也、其他如各種汽車之登記。載客人數。以及容量速率耗油等表。亦均詳明。惟讀者以上列三項。更覺重要。且所以促廣州市汽車界之改進。爰不嫌辭費而書其後云。一週間汽車肇禍記三原日期　　　　地址　　汽車號碼　　　受傷人　　傷勢　　　最後情形二十三日　黃浦灘　　七二四八　　　某姓男孩　重傷　　　醫治無效身死　二十三日　車站路　　楊明富駕　　　周長富　　重傷身死　令地保棺殮　　二十四日　陸家浜　　公共汽車　　　徐阿土　　碾傷腿骨　解法院訊辦二十六日　鄧脫路口　一○七二　　　某甲　　　腦部重傷　醫治無效身死二十七日　貝勒路口　某號　　　　　某姓男孩　重傷　　　送廣慈醫院二十八日　寳山路　　公共汽車　　　撞在栅門　栅門稍破　車夫交保候核二十九日　天潼路　　一六八九六　　俞阿祥　　重傷身死　可向法院起訴本週間汽車肇禍。共有七起。内因重傷身死者。計男子三人男孩一人。重傷男孩一人。傷腿足者。男子一人。毁物一起。譯叢奥國汽車界要人行踪　錄　談紫電　　汽車家羅斯氏（Ｊ·Ｈ·Ｒhodes)。現帶其妻離國。起程赴英美二國考察汽車事業。　　汽車界先進雪特大倍氏（Ｓid　Darby)居美洲北部八載。現已回奥國密爾蓬（Ｍelbourne)地方。其好友倍萊（Ｂerry）勞溪（Ｒoche）泰美克（Ｔamac）等爲之設宴洗塵云。　　奥至卡汽車公司經理者貝氏（Ｃooper)。現被聘爲維多利亞吞潑爾汽車公司（Ｔemple　Motors)經理。等門司理發行司蒂倍克汽車事宜。　　羅司公司（Ｒootes　Ltd.）代表勃萊尼君（Ｂlayney）現被派至新西蘭一帶考察云。專件英華汽車名詞錄（二）（九）丁祖澤Lathe車床Ｌay　shaft副軸（變速機）Lead　peroxide　一養化鉛（蓄電池極板用）Lean　mixture　淡混合汽Seather　clutch　facing分機皮裏面Left　handcontrol　car左御車Left　side左側（當駕駛者坐對車前。其左。方者皆曰左側）</p>

<p>(Beiping) The party headquarters at all levels in Peiping and Tianjin believe that the seven basic conditions of the Expansion Conference, (1) The convening of a National Assembly, with various professional groups as constituent members, are the same as Duan Qirui's National Assembly, and do not allow civilians involved in disputes to participate. It is said that the Prime Minister's nation-building strategy should be carefully explained to dispel public doubts. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Negotiations to Abolish Submarine Cable Agreements</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of abolishing the submarine cable agreements of the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Pacific companies, the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly negotiated and firmly insisted.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Municipal Party Headquarters had ordered the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce Reorganization Committee to cease its activities. Now, after discussions by various trade associations in the city's business community, it has been decided to petition the Central National Government's Ministry of Industry and Commerce to maintain the National Government's laws and credit, and to allow the committee to continue its work so that it can actively prepare for reorganization in accordance with the new Chamber of Commerce Law. Regarding the new Chamber of Commerce Law promulgated by the Municipal Government on August 15, 1929, the regulations stipulated a one-year establishment period, which expires on August 15 of this year. In this city, there are more than 30 established trade associations, which must wait for the Municipal Party Headquarters to issue permits. Those that have not been established are still in the process of organizing and may be difficult to complete on schedule. A request will be submitted to extend the deadline appropriately.</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan previously received a petition from the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation regarding the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters' resolution to send personnel to take over the old Chamber of Commerce. The Executive Yuan found that the reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce was still more than a month away from the legal deadline. How could it be confused with the Chamber of Commerce Association? It dared not approve it and issued an order to stop it. It was sent to the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee for verification. The Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee replied to the Executive Yuan that the problems with the Jiangsu Provincial Party Affairs and the reorganization of business groups by the Rectification Committee have been corrected by the order of the meeting. The Executive Yuan notified it.</p>
<h3>Beining Railway Bureau</h3>
<h3>Plans to Issue Short-Term Bonds</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Beining Railway Bureau believes that the locomotives on the line are insufficient, and has established a committee to raise funds for purchasing locomotives. After detailed research, it believes that in addition to retaining 44 locomotives from other lines, it should purchase a minimum of 12 passenger locomotives, 26 freight locomotives, and 2 shunting locomotives, for a total of 40 locomotives. It has also reached an agreement with Jin Cheng, Yanye, and Zhongnan Banks that, in addition to the Railway Bureau depositing funds with these banks each month for the purchase of locomotives, it plans to issue short-term bonds of 5 million yuan in two batches, underwritten by the three banks. The first batch plans to purchase 20 locomotives first. The bond regulations have been drafted and submitted to the Ministry of Railways. The Ministry of Railways recently stated that the lack of locomotives on the line is indeed a fact. The estimated cost of purchasing the locomotives is approximately 3.6 million national currency. In addition to the Railway Bureau depositing funds each month, it is also necessary to issue public bonds of 1.8 million yuan. The remaining 3.2 million yuan in bonds will be sold when the second batch of locomotives is purchased. The proposed regulations have also been revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for review by the Legislative Yuan. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Postal Workers' Strike Resolved</h3>
<h3>Conditions Signed Last Night</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Tianjin postal workers issued a declaration on the morning of the 29th, listing the crimes of A. Liangxi, and telegraphed the Shanghai postal workers, requesting the General Post Office to quickly remove and punish A. Liangxi to avoid major turmoil. At the same time, the Trade Union also came forward to assist the Trade Union, and also sent a letter to the Postmaster A. Liangxi, accusing him of despising the strike, and the wording was strict. The Garrison Department was afraid of the expansion of the strike and ordered the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Zeng Yanyi, to mediate. Zeng sent Wu Jinrong, together with Zhang Jinren, a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, to the Administration Bureau at noon on the 29th. At this time, A. Liangxi's attitude had softened and he was discussing the terms with the strike representatives. Wu and Zhang joined the arbitration, and the three parties negotiated and signed a resolution at 7:00 in the evening. (1) A salary increase of three yuan for those with a monthly salary below 50 yuan, and two yuan for those with a monthly salary below 80 yuan, will be implemented from July. If this method in Beiping is popularized in all bureaus in the postal area, the Hebei postal area will also issue it in the same way. (2) Revise the salary rate for postal assistants and below. The Postmaster should urge the General Post Office to revise it in the near future. (3) Guarantee that no harm will be done to the striking personnel, such as recording demerits and fining wages. There is also a fourth item: the Postmaster should provide various conveniences to the Trade Union. A. Liangxi firmly denied this. Later, through the mediation of the mediator, it was changed to be recognized verbally by A. and the Director of the Public Security Bureau. The Trade Union immediately issued a notice, canceling the strike at 8:00 on the evening of the 29th, and restoring everything to its original state. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Naval Treaty and Budget</h3>
<p>The two current problems for the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan, namely the ratification of the naval treaty and the preparation of the budget, are not easy to solve. Now the United Kingdom's government budget proposal has been passed in the House of Commons, and the United States' London Naval Treaty has also been passed by the Senate and approved by the President. Thus, the United Kingdom and the United States have reduced many disputes over these two problems. However, in Japan alone, the disputes over these two problems still remain. Why is this so? Because the organization of the Japanese government is more complex than that of the United Kingdom and the United States, its powers are more constrained, and there are many historical conflicts among the various key figures due to differences in status. Therefore, one problem often involves many parties. For example, today's naval treaty and budget: the opinions among the Privy Council and the government, between the government and the Navy, and between the Navy and the Naval General Staff cannot be unified. Moreover, the claims of the political parties in opposition and the leaders of the capitalists often differ from the government. It is difficult to obtain understanding from many parties on one problem. Therefore, Japan's problems are more difficult to solve than those of the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, considering Japan's current situation, according to the claims of military experts, it is indeed necessary to expand military preparations due to its geopolitical position. However, the government's finances are facing difficulties in maintaining all undertakings due to a sharp decline in income. Moreover, adding the unprecedented economic recession, the people are angry at the government's failure to provide relief and are attacking the government's incompetence. The military faction is also insisting on the national defense plan without any compromise. The government authorities have these factual difficulties, and the opinions of all parties are also diverging. Therefore, its handling is indeed more difficult than that of the United Kingdom and the United States.</p>
<p>Judging from this situation, let alone the two problems of the naval treaty and the budget, failure to resolve them will endanger the government. Even if they are fortunately passed through the mediation of many people, it is difficult to guarantee that disputes will not arise over other problems. Because of this fundamental difficulty, it is not easy for any government, no matter how talented and promising, to handle the aftermath well.</p>

<h3>Canadian General Election</h3>
<p>Conservatives Take the Upper Hand</p>
<p>Riots Occur in Various Places</p>
<p>National Press, Montreal, 28th - The Canadian election for 245 members of the House of Commons began today in excellent weather. The entire population is paying great attention to this event, and coupled with the good weather, the number of votes is expected to be very high. According to the Conservative Party, their party will occupy at least 134 seats in this election of members. Observers predict that because there are so many votes cast in various places this time, the counting process may not be completed in a few days. In several key areas, the number of votes can be calculated within a few hours, at which time it can be foreseen which party will be in control of the government. The Liberal Party continues to stick to its old strategy, relying on farmers and progressives as its backers, while the Conservative Party advocates raising tariffs and copying the example of the United States.</p>
<p>National Press, Montreal, 28th - According to the election votes received, the Conservative Party has won a complete victory, and the power of the MacKenzie King government is about to be swept away. As of midnight today, the comparison rate of the votes obtained by each party is as follows: the Conservative Party obtained a total of 93, the Liberal Party 47, but British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Vancouver are not included. From the current number of votes, the Conservative Party can get one seat out of every fourteen seats in the parliament. In today's election, riots occurred in Montreal and several other places. In Chariott Town, a Mr. Towfenals was killed, and 16 people were arrested at the time on suspicion. If the Conservative Party comes to power this time, it will definitely take retaliatory measures against the new tariffs of the United States.</p>
<p>Reuters, Ottawa, 29th - The results of Canada's general election have not yet been fully known, but according to reports, the Liberal Party, that is, the government party, has suffered a major defeat, and the Conservative Party has benefited greatly, which is really unexpected.

Before the dissolution of parliament, the Liberal Party occupied 123 seats and the Conservative Party occupied 90 seats.</p>

<p>Important News: The 80th Meeting of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>On the 29th, the 80th meeting of the Executive Yuan was attended by Tan Yankai, Yi Peiji, Liu Ruiheng, Wang Zhengting, Sun Ke, and Jiang Menglin. Zhang Weihua, Chen Shaokuan, Zheng Hongnian, Zeng Yangfu, Chen Yi, and Lu Bicheng were present as observers. Tan Yankai presided over the meeting.</p>
<p>(A) Matters Reported:</p>
<p>(1) A total of fifteen work reports and administrative plans were submitted by various ministries, commissions, provinces, and municipal governments.</p>
<p>(B) Matters Discussed:</p>
<p>(1) The Ministry of Interior reported that according to the City Organization Law, cities established under Article 2, Paragraph 1, are under the jurisdiction of the ministries and commissions. However, cities established under Article 2, Paragraph 2, or Article 3, are under the jurisdiction of the provincial governments. The Ministry of Interior believes that cities under the provincial government per Article 2, Paragraph 2, with a population of over one million or special political and economic circumstances, can have mayors appointed to senior positions, such as Guangzhou and Beiping. If they are merely the seat of the provincial government and do not meet the requirements of Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 2, or Article 3, they should still be handled according to Article 3, with mayors appointed to junior positions, such as Kaifeng, Jinan, Ningbo, and Zhengzhou. In the future, provincial governments submitting requests to establish cities or appoint mayors should follow this procedure for restriction. Cities under the provincial government, whether the mayor is senior or junior, should be supervised and directed by the provincial civil affairs department and other responsible departments to clarify the system. The proposal is to be submitted to the government for approval and implementation. Resolved: To be submitted to the government for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Navy reported on the resolutions of the Hong Kong Meteorological Conference and requested the construction of an observatory on the Nansha Islands. The proposal is to be submitted to the government for record. Resolved: To be submitted to the government for record.</p>
<p>(3) The Jiangsu Provincial Government reported that Qian Jihou, the chief of the first section of the Civil Affairs Department, had resigned. It is proposed that Lu Changgeng, the secretary, be transferred to fill the vacancy, and that Tong Danian be appointed as the secretary. The proposal is to be submitted to the government for approval and appointment/removal. Resolved: To be submitted to the government for appointment/removal.</p>
<p>Recent Work of the Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>Efforts to Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>Hu Puan, member of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, reported on the recent work of the provincial government at the provincial government's memorial week. His remarks are as follows: The four words "maintain the status quo" may easily be misunderstood as inaction. Our provincial government has been reorganized for more than four months. When we first arrived, we stated that our work was to reorganize, tighten where necessary, and develop where possible. I said at that time, "Some people say that the provincial government is going backward, but we are not going backward. We are taking the machine to the factory for repair because it is broken. When it is repaired, we will prepare to drive fast in the future." Now, some people may ask, "You have been repairing for four months. Even if you cannot repair everything, you should have repaired some parts. Now you should drive fast and show us." However, we have not only not driven fast, but we also have not had time to repair the broken car. We have devoted all our energy to maintaining the status quo. Why is this? You must know that because the military situation in this province has not ended recently, many reactionary forces, bandits, and communists are even more active. They want to destroy the current situation in this province. We, the colleagues of the provincial government, must devote all our energy to maintaining the status quo to prevent it from being destroyed by them. Therefore, our work of maintaining the status quo seems to be inactive and backward, but it is not so in reality. (Omission) Why maintain the status quo? The simple answer to this question is "because someone is destroying the status quo." For example, the recent work of the provincial government has focused on suppressing bandits and communists, hoping to fulfill our responsibilities. However, no matter how hard we try to suppress the bandits and communists, we cannot completely eliminate them. It is not that we do not want to eliminate them, but because the war has not ended, our strength is inevitably somewhat constrained. For the time being, we only hope that the reactionary forces will not extend their influence. Next, let's talk about official governance. Of course, we want to appoint county magistrates who will work hard for the people and seek local autonomy. But now we only hope that a county magistrate can fight bandits, and we will consider him a good official. This is not to say that the duties of a county magistrate are limited to this, but because the current situation is like this, we have to maintain it in this way. Then, let's talk about the financial situation of this province. The tightest financial budget of this province has been approved. However, this budget can only maintain the administrative status quo. Many construction projects cannot be taken care of. We just need to maintain this budget well, and there will always be a way in the next session. I am presenting this topic to you because many people misunderstand that this government is not doing work. You must know that this work that seems to be inactive, maintaining the status quo, is several times more difficult than the work of moving forward.</p>
<p>Financial Deficit of the Jiangsu Provincial Government</p>
<p>Although Jiangsu Province is known as the land of wealth in Jiangnan, it has been excessively taxed since 1920. In addition, military affairs and natural disasters have expanded government spending, leading to impoverished people and exhausted wealth, with income falling short of expenditure. Therefore, at the beginning of the tenure of the provincial government committee, Chairman Ye Chucang took reducing government spending as the starting point for administration. The budget for 1920 barely managed to balance revenue and expenditure, which was already very difficult. However, in recent months, government spending has become even more strained. Although the financial department has payment orders for government spending by various agencies, banks rarely comply, rendering them ineffective. Regarding the regular expenses of the provincial party headquarters, for example, 16,000 yuan per month, 18,000 yuan has been owed and not paid. Daily food expenses rely solely on income tax subsidies (the income tax of officials in various agencies in this province is submitted to the central government by the provincial party headquarters). The salaries for June for other agencies have also not been fully paid.</p>
<p>Eight Counties in Xuzhou Area Will Launch a Large-Scale Bandit Suppression Campaign</p>
<p>Song Runtian Appointed as Bandit Suppression Commander</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: After the Xuzhou Camp convened a joint defense and bandit suppression meeting, He Yaogong immediately submitted the resolutions to Commander-in-Chief Chiang for approval. Chiang has ordered the appointment of Song Runtian, the Xuzhou Garrison Commander, to concurrently serve as the bandit suppression commander for the eight counties. He Yaogong has accepted the order and, on the 26th, issued a telegram in the name of the camp, informing the relevant parties. The telegram stated: To County Magistrate Yang of Fengxian, County Magistrate Xu of Peixian, County Magistrate Wen of Suining, County Magistrate Wang of Dangshan, County Magistrate Cui of Suqian, County Magistrate Wang of Xiaoxian, County Magistrate Luo of Pixian, and Commander Song and County Magistrate Yang of Xuzhou for distribution, (1) The county magistrates are instructed to follow the decisions of the March conference and each send a committee member to Xuzhou within three days to organize a joint office for bandit suppression in the eight counties. (2) Xuzhou Garrison Commander Song Runtian is appointed as the concurrent commander of bandit suppression in the eight counties. (3) All police forces in the counties are to be under the command and dispatch of Commander Song. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Chung-cheng, Camp Director He Yaogong's participation.) Currently, the dispatch of representatives and the organization of the bandit suppression office are underway. As for the bandit situation in the Xuzhou area, the situation varies from county to county. Most bandits are taking advantage of the rising sorghum crops to cause trouble. A small number of communists are also directing them. The recent bandit situation and suppression efforts are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Eastern Xuzhou</p>
<p>The eastern part of Tongshan County, which borders Pixian and Suining, has accumulated bandits such as Cao Chuanjin, Li Xiao, Liang Guangju, Zhu Conglun, and Liu Qi. Recently, taking advantage of the rising sorghum crops, they gathered hundreds of people and occupied Wuyao, 60 li from the city, and have been active in the 11th and 12th districts. It is reported that a communist leader, Lu Shiwen, is directing them. On the 23rd, they attacked and broke through Wangzhakou. On the 24th, they broke through Shizhuangwei again, setting fire that lasted for two days. They abducted 50 to 60 men and women as hostages. They then fled to the Quanhe Luojiawei Xiaonanzhuang area, causing disturbances in Shichengzi Taoyuan Fangshang and other weis. The local security groups and village associations have repeatedly suppressed them. However, because the sorghum has not been harvested, it is easy for the bandits to hide, and the bandits are relatively numerous. They have reported to the county government and requested troops. Wang Bingyue, the police captain of Fangshangwei, once led a team to search and suppress them. After the bandits broke through Fangshangwei, they abducted hostages and fled south. When they reached Guaishantou, they were intercepted by the police team, killing more than ten bandits and capturing Yang Pei, a bandit. Lu Ruting, the captain of the county police brigade, also dispatched a team to suppress them, and the momentum has been slightly reduced.</p>
<p>Western Xuzhou</p>
<p>There are more bandits in Xiaoxian County than in other places. A month ago, they looted Huangkou and abducted hostages. It is reported that the bandits are gathered from Xiaoxian and southern Suzhou. They have spread from the northwest of Xiao to the southeast of Xiao, covering nearly a hundred li. County Magistrate Wang Gongyu of Xiao has been diligently supervising the suppression. Since mid-month, they have divided into north and south routes. The south route fought fiercely with the bandits for two days in Wuzonglin, Dashahe, Taotun, and other places in western Xiao, killing many bandits. Then, in Zulaolou, Xiangshanmiao, Yangxiaolou, and other places, they fought with more than 2,000 bandits, eventually defeating the bandits. About 50 to 60 bandits were killed or wounded, and more than 70 hostages were rescued. The north route advanced to Qulibu from the middle of the month, fighting with the bandits in the sorghum crops. More than 100 bandits were killed or wounded, dozens were captured, and several guns, two horses, and many red cloth symbols were seized. The bandits fled southwest. County Magistrate Wang supervised the team and chased them to Xialou on the south bank of the Shahe River before returning. The bandits in Xiao have been greatly reduced in momentum after this painful suppression. (27th)</p>
<p>Lu Diping Actively Suppresses Communists and Bandits: Jiangxi Provincial Government Offers Rewards for the Arrest of Zhu and Mao</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Lu Diping, Chairman of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, believes that bandits and communists are rampant in various parts of the province. Peng Dehuai appears in northern Jiangxi, Huang Gonglue burns and kills in western Jiangxi, and Zhu and Mao spread poison on the border of Jiangxi and Fujian. Small groups of communists in other counties also harass everywhere, attacking cities and capturing pools. This time, Luo Binghui took advantage of the situation and attacked Xingan and Zhangshu, advancing to Fengcheng, more than 120 li from the province (several hours by car). Therefore, Lu Te telegraphed Commander-in-Chief Chiang, President Tan, Chief of General Staff Zhu, Director He, and Commander Liu, requesting additional troops to Jiangxi to suppress bandits as soon as possible to achieve thorough elimination. At the same time, he sent Deputy Adjutant Cao of the Ninth Route Army, Secretary General Huang of the Garrison Headquarters, and Deng Shan, Director of the Nanchang Municipal Finance Bureau, to Xianghan to discuss the bandit suppression issues in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces. As for the 53rd Brigade, 54th Brigade, and 52nd Brigade, after they recovered Xingan City and Zhangshu Town on the 24th and 25th, they recovered Qingjiang on the 26th. Luo's bandits fled in two routes, one from Qingjiang across the Gan River to western Jiangxi, and the other from Chongren Le'an to eastern Jiangxi, and will turn back to Yongfeng. As for the troops coming to Jiangxi from Hubei, they have landed from Xun and are advancing to suppress the bandits and communists in the Gan River. One regiment has arrived in Dean and is stationed along the Nanxun Road.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Jiangxi Provincial Government telegraphed all units of the Ninth Route Army and all agencies under the provincial government to jointly arrest Zhu and Mao. A reward of 50,000 yuan will be given for the heads of Zhu and Mao, and a reward of 100,000 yuan will be given for those who capture them alive. The original telegram is as follows: "The communist bandits Zhu and Mao appear on the borders of Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi provinces. Wherever they flee, they burn, loot, and massacre cruelly. Houses are in ruins. Jiangxi Province has suffered the most, creating a tragic situation of burning flames and thorns everywhere. Although they have been repeatedly besieged and suppressed, they have not been brought to justice. Now that the bandits have learned that our central government is gathering a large army to attack Yan and Feng and has no time to take care of the south, they have taken advantage of the situation to sneak into Jiangxi again, contacting Peng and Huang's forces, and occasionally capturing county towns, attempting to attack Nanchang and peep into the Yangtze River. They are swarming like bees and ants. If they are not eliminated as soon as possible, how can we consolidate the rear and appease Yan Lu? Therefore, we are issuing a reward again. If the bandit suppression troops and police teams of each county can kill Zhu and Mao and offer their heads, a total reward of 50,000 yuan will be given. Those who can capture Zhu and Mao alive and send them to the government will be given a total reward of 100,000 yuan. The funds have been reserved. Let each of you work hard, eliminate harm for the people, and strive together. Please forward this order to all subordinates for compliance." (28th)</p>
<p>Liaoning Organizes Military Commission</p>
<p>Eliminate Old Military Officers and Replace Them with Military Academy Students</p>
<p>Reduce the Number of Each Brigade and Improve the Living Conditions of Soldiers</p>
<p>Panyang Dispatch: The purpose of Zhang Xueliang's organization of the Northeast Army Reorganization Committee is to reduce the number of each brigade and increase the salaries of soldiers and officers below the rank of major. The main task of the various important officials of the Border Defense Department who have been going to Huludao these days is for this matter. Zhang plans to formulate the reorganization outline before August 1st so that the committee can follow it after its establishment to facilitate the progress. There are two main items in this reorganization: (1) Employing graduates of the Military Academy. As of the tenth class graduating on August 21st this year, the Northeast Army Military Academy has a total of more than 7,000 graduates. Many are currently unemployed, which defeats the original intention of cultivating talents. Although Zhang Xueliang has repeatedly ordered the various infantry teams to eliminate corrupt and old military officers and employ graduates of the Military Academy, it has not been realized due to various reasons. This reorganization will send illiterate and corrupt old military officers to the Military Academy for training, or transfer them to other military agencies to serve. Those with the worst performance will be placed in the surplus positions and returned to their fields. All middle and lower-level military officers in the various units will be graduates of the Military Academy. If there are still vacancies, a military officer brigade will be formed to accommodate them. (1) Reducing the number of people and increasing the salary. The original establishment of the Northeast Army was 220 people per company, plus special forces, totaling about 10,000 people. It is reported that the planned reorganization will reduce the number of people per company to 120 people. In addition, each brigade of special infantry will not exceed 7,000 people. The old and weak will be completely eliminated, and the remaining salaries will be fully increased to soldiers and officers below the rank of major to improve the lives of soldiers and lower-level officers.</p>
<p>In addition, the establishment of the Military Affairs Committee is currently being planned. However, it is not yet certain whether the two military affairs offices of the Border Defense Department will be abolished at the same time, or whether one office will be abolished and one office will be retained, or whether both offices will be temporarily retained. Director Wang Shuchang's trip to Huludao this time is for the issue of the retention or abolition of the office system, facing Zhang Xueliang for instructions and solutions.</p>
<p>Northeast Roads Implement Intermodal Transport</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Since the price of gold soared, the South Manchuria Railway and other railways calculated in gold standard, and their freight rates were nearly doubled compared to the national railways calculated in silver standard. Therefore, merchants and travelers have recently flocked to the national railways. In view of this, the Northeast Transportation Authority has held intermodal transport, reduced freight rates, to understand merchant difficulties and resist foreign aggression. Currently, the Shenhai Road Bureau has reached an agreement with the Jihai Road to first implement intermodal transport. The ticket prices have been reduced and are as follows: (A) One-way ticket price: first class 10 yuan in silver, or 10 yuan and 10 cents in Harbin currency; second class 6 yuan and 60 cents in silver, or 6 yuan and 65 cents in Harbin currency; third class 3 yuan and 70 cents in silver, or 3 yuan and 75 cents in Harbin currency. (B) Round-trip ticket price: first class 16 yuan in silver, or 16 yuan and 20 cents in Harbin currency; second class 10 yuan and 6 cents in silver, or 10 yuan and 50 cents in Harbin currency; third class 5 yuan and 95 cents in silver, or 6 yuan in Harbin currency. Use silver to go to Shenyang, use Harbin currency to go to Jilin. (C) Train schedule: departs from Shenyang at 7:30 am every day and arrives in Jilin at 9:40 pm. The time from Jilin to Shenyang is the same. The intermodal transport of the Beining Shenhai Jihai three lines was originally scheduled to be implemented on July 1st, but it was postponed due to various procedures that have not yet been completed. Now, preparations have been made carefully, and the vehicles have also been allocated properly. A total of 32 vehicles are planned to be prepared by the three roads for trial use first. Two first- and second-class combined cars and eight third-class passenger cars, four dining cars, four postal cars, and four guard cars/baggage combined cars will be prepared by the Beining Road. One first- and second-class combined car and five third-class passenger cars will be prepared by the Shenhai Road. One first- and second-class combined car and three third-class passenger cars will be prepared by the Jihai Road. The opening date is scheduled to be from August 1st and will not be postponed again. Gao Jiyi, Chairman of the Northeast Transportation Committee, inspected the situation of the roads and made preparations for the opening. He took the Tongliao car from Dahushan to the north on the 16th, transferring to Sitao Taoang to Angangxi, and folding into Qiqihar, then transferring to the Middle East, and going to Shenhai by Jichang Road, and then returning to Shenyang for inspection along the line. Once the inspection is completed, the intermodal transport from Beiping to Jilin will be opened. The freight rates for both passengers and goods will be greatly reduced and based on silver. It is expected that the business of various national roads in Northeast China will be able to make progress every day.</p>
<p>Shenyang</p>
<p>Japanese Army Destroys Railway Traffic</p>
<p>Shenyang Dispatch: Recently, the 33rd Infantry Regiment of the Japanese Garrison stationed in Shenyang and the 6th Battalion of the Japanese Garrison stationed in Anshan held a large-scale field exercise in the territory of Shenyang and Liaoyang counties. The barbaric actions of the Japanese soldiers were like bamboo shoots after a rain. According to the report of the Beining Road Bureau to the Northeast Transportation Committee, dozens of Japanese troops passed through the Shenyang crossing. At that time, there was a train of earth cars on the road, heading from Huanggu Tun to Shenyang New Station. When it was about to pass the crossing, the crossing keeper lowered the barrier to block pedestrians and avoid danger. Unexpectedly, the Japanese soldiers cut the iron wire on the barrier without waiting for the train to pass and forced their way through. The patrolmen on duty tried to dissuade them to no avail, and had to let them pass by relying on their barbarism. The road workers reported to the front section and sent people to repair it immediately. The setting of railway crossings and barriers is originally used to block pedestrians when trains pass to avoid danger. It is very important. At that time, the barrier at the Shenyang crossing had been lowered, which clearly indicated that a train was passing, temporarily blocking pedestrians. However, the Japanese soldiers did not wait for the train to pass and did not listen to the dissuasion of the patrolmen. They cut the iron wire of the barrier and forced their way through, causing much damage to railway traffic. It should be seriously negotiated to uphold national rights and maintain road administration. (24th)</p>
<p>Anfeng Road</p>
<p>Case of Japanese Garrison Shooting and Killing Chinese</p>
<p>Andong Dispatch: Since the opening of the Anfeng Railway, the Japanese garrison soldiers have gradually increased, and branch guards are stationed at major stations along the line, patrolling the line day and night with guns and ammunition. The restrictions on Chinese people passing through the railway are extremely strict, and ominous events have occurred frequently as a result. Unexpectedly, recently, the Japanese garrison team of the Anfeng Railway staged another tragedy of shooting and killing Chinese. The situation is as follows: On the 19th of this month, at about 10:00 am, a Chinese person was passing by a railway bridge south of the Liujiahe Station along the Anfeng Railway. Coincidentally, three garrison team members on patrol came face to face with guns. The person was unable to avoid them and was seized by the Japanese army and taken to a nearby bunker and temporarily detained. When an express train arrived, the person was escorted to the Liujiahe Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. At this time, two of the three Japanese soldiers happened to be out, leaving only Zhu You Chang Er alone to guard in the bunker. The person saw an opportunity to escape. The guard noticed it and was about to beat him severely. The person had no choice but to resist, snatched the Japanese soldier's bayonet, and stabbed him twice. The Japanese soldier was injured and shouted loudly. The Japanese soldiers who were out suddenly heard the cry for help and rushed back, and one assisted the injured person in fighting with the Chinese. The Chinese, outnumbered, feared being poisoned by the Japanese army, so he burst out and fled into the deep fields of crops. Unexpectedly, the injured Japanese soldier fired two shots from behind. The second bullet pierced the vital point of the Chinese person. He fell to the ground and died. The Japanese army ignored him and left together. Later, passers-by discovered the body of the deceased and notified the village head of the village. Because human life was at stake, they did not dare to hide it and truthfully reported it to the Fengcheng County Government. The next day, Secretary Wang, accompanied by the Director of the Public Security Bureau and Prosecutor Zhang from the Procuratorate, arrived at the scene of the corpse to conduct an examination according to law. There was a bullet wound on the head of the deceased, which was the fatal wound. They immediately filled out the corpse form and temporarily buried it so that the deceased's family could come to identify the body. The Fengcheng County Government has lodged a serious protest with the Liujiahe Garrison Team regarding this case, seeking justice for the deceased. The garrison team initially refused to admit that there was a shooting and killing of Chinese people, but the evidence was conclusive and there was no way to deny it. Then they claimed that it was legitimate defense before they opened fire, accidentally hitting a stray bullet, etc. This matter is currently under negotiation. What the result will be is difficult to predict. (July 22)</p>
<p>Civil Law</p>
<p>Prerequisites for Inheritance and Kinship Sections (Continued)</p>
<p>Review Opinions of the Central Political Council</p>
<p>The order of each legal heir is to list direct descendants as the first order, which is in line with human sentiment and is also common to all countries in the world. Although parents before siblings, and siblings before grandparents are not common to all countries, their order is drafted as above because it is in line with human sentiment in our country. As for legal heirs who are limited to grandparents, they are not mentioned much because the relationship is already distant. In addition, the following should be explained: (1) The same order gives priority to those with closer kinship. It is a general rule of inheritance that those with the same degree of kinship are heirs. If someone dies before the start of the inheritance, or loses the right of inheritance, it is proposed to stipulate that their share of inheritance should be inherited by their direct descendants. (2) Direct descendants were originally limited to those born in wedlock. However, concubines and illegitimate children are also children not born in wedlock. However, there are still concubines today, and illegitimate children are also unavoidable. The old laws of our country did not discriminate against concubines. It is proposed to retain them. As for illegitimate children, the old laws only stipulated that half the amount should be given according to the quantity of sons. However, if illegitimate children are recognized, they should be considered children in law. Regarding the inheritance of property, they are the same as children born in wedlock, which is also the recent trend in legislation. Therefore, it is specially clarified. If the kinship section generally defines concubines and recognized illegitimate children as not different from children born in wedlock in law, then there is no need for special regulations on inheritance. (3) Adopted children were originally treated as children by the deceased during their lifetime. The old laws stipulated that property should be given at discretion, which was too unstandardized. It is now proposed to respect the deceased's feelings during their lifetime and define them as having the same rank as biological children, but their share of inheritance is one-half of the share of inheritance of biological children. In addition, it has been found that many European and American countries have designated heirs in addition to legal heirs. This system originated in Roman law, and many countries have followed it. Moreover, its scope is very broad, such as one, not limited to when there are no legal heirs, two, the designated person is not limited to one person, three, regardless of whether they are relatives or non-relatives, four, there is nothing wrong with inheriting all or part of the property. This is to respect the wishes of the deceased. According to the social situation in our country, it seems appropriate to adopt this system. Therefore, it is proposed to adopt it appropriately and modify it, and stipulate that designated heirs can only be designated when there are no direct descendants to inherit all or part of their property. Both the designated and the designated are not gender-specific. In addition, what should be noted is that the order and share of legal heirs apply when the deceased has no special disposition of the estate, but the special reserve is still not affected. Question 4: Should spouses inherit the estate? Spouses should have the right to inherit each other's estate. (Explanation) The old laws of our country did not give wives the right to inherit their husband's estate. The so-called keeping chastity without children and inheriting the husband's share is only temporary management. Although there were no explicit provisions for husbands regarding wives, in practice, the property of wives was not separated from the property of husbands. After the death of a wife, her estate belonged to her husband. Previous precedents of the Beijing Dali Court also clearly recognized that husbands could inherit the estate of wives who died without children. This is one of the husband's rights system that does not conform to modern thinking. According to the old laws of our country, only those who inherited the lineage could inherit the estate. The two could not be separated. Therefore, there was no right to inherit the estate between spouses. From today's perspective, the inheritance of the lineage is a matter of succession to the right to worship, and the inheritance of the estate is a matter of transferring property rights. The intentions are different and should not be confused. This is the second point that the lineage system does not conform to modern thinking. From the principle, since men and women are equal, and the inheritance of the estate is not premised on the inheritance of the lineage, then the spouses should be recognized as having the right to inherit each other's estate because of the deep relationship between the interests of the spouses. Question 5: Order and share of inheritance of spouses. The inheritance of spouses is not limited to a certain order. Their share of inheritance is determined according to the following clauses: 1. When there are heirs of the first order, distribute equally with each heir. 2. When inheriting with heirs of the second or third order, their share of inheritance is one-half of the estate. 3. When inheriting with heirs of the fourth order, their share of inheritance is two-thirds of the estate. 4. When there are no heirs of the first to fourth order, their share of inheritance is the entire estate. (Explanation) The provisions of the civil laws of various countries on this issue are roughly divided into two categories: (1) Listing spouses in a certain order; (2) There is no certain order, and they can inherit at the same time as any order, with differences in their share of inheritance. The Civil Law of Japan belongs to the first category. Spouses are in the third order. If there are direct descendants of the first order, the spouses will not receive anything. If there are no direct descendants, the spouses will receive the entire estate, which is too biased and unfair. Germany, Switzerland, and other countries belong to the second category, which is more moderate in balancing and adjusting and can be adopted. However, their regulations on the share of inheritance are too cumbersome and should not be taken. Now, the inheritance of spouses is appropriately determined, either distributed equally with other heirs, or obtaining two points of the estate.</p>
<p>Page 11</p>
<p>Important news is to obtain one, or obtain two-thirds of the estate, which is also based on the order of those who inherit at the same time, and determines the amount of their inheritance share.</p>
<p>Question 6: How should the property given before the start of inheritance be calculated? If a legal heir has received property as a gift from the deceased before the start of inheritance due to marriage, separation, or business, etc., the donated property should be included in the calculation of the estate at the start of inheritance, unless the deceased had a contrary intention at the time of the gift, which is not the case here (Explanation) Legal heirs each have their own share of the inherited property. If an heir has received a property donation before the death of the deceased for special reasons, such as non-incorporation into the calculation, it is too much to get from the proceeds. There is a non-compliance with the purpose of the heir's heir to be fair. The articles of the Civil Law of various countries are different in detail, but the principles are roughly the same. Therefore, it is planned to adopt them appropriately, but if the donor has expressed their intention at the time of the gift that it does not need to be included in the estate calculation, it should be an exception in order to respect the freedom of intention of the parties.</p>
<p>Question 7: Should compensation be prescribed for heirs who have contributed to the estate? Is it unnecessary to prescribe compensation for heirs who have contributed to the estate? (Explanation) Switzerland adopts a system that requires compensation, limited to adult children who have contributed labor or capital in joint life. However, in our country, those who live together and share wealth have the responsibility to jointly maintain family property, which is of course not to mention. Even if they live separately and divide wealth, relatives work together and help each other are also regarded as obligations that should be fulfilled. If it is explicitly allowed by law to request compensation when inheriting the estate, it will be enough to open the end of the dispute, so it is considered unnecessary to stipulate.</p>
<p>Question 8: Should a special reserve be prescribed? A special reserve should be prescribed. (Explanation) The legislative examples of various countries on this issue include those that adopt the principle of individual freedom of disposal, such as the United Kingdom and the United States, and those that adopt the principle of maintaining kinship relations, such as Germany, France, Switzerland, and Japan. Those who adopt the first principle give complete freedom to dispose of individual estates without restriction. Those who adopt the second principle allow individuals to dispose of their estates freely, while the law stipulates that the special reserve enjoyed by relatives is absolutely unaffected. Compared with the two, the second principle is more reasonable, so it is planned to adopt it.</p>
<p>Question 9: Scope of the special reserve? The scope of the special reserve is determined according to the following clauses: 1. The special reserve of each direct descendant and spouse is one-half of their share of inheritance. 2. The special reserve of parents is one-half of their share of inheritance. 3. The special reserve of siblings is one-third of their share of inheritance. 4. The special reserve of grandparents is one-third of their share of inheritance. (Explanation) There are two main differences in the meaning and calculation standards of the regulations of various countries on the special reserve: (1) The overall special reserve method; (2) The individual special reserve method. The former is adopted by the French law system. Its special reserve part is reserved for the whole body of listed heirs, and its calculation standard is based on how many points are given to the estate. The latter is adopted by the German law system. Its special reserve part is reserved for each of the listed heirs separately, and its calculation standard is based on how many points of the share of inheritance of each heir are. The results of the two are different. For example, when one of the heirs who enjoys the special reserve loses the right of inheritance, according to the first method, their special reserve will belong to other heirs who enjoy the special reserve. According to the second method, their special reserve is included in the part of free disposal and has nothing to do with other heirs who enjoy the special reserve. According to the special reserve, the original system of free disposal is an exception. Since the enjoyer has lost their rights, it is superior to include it in the free disposal part in terms of reason. Moreover, this method does not hinder other enjoyers, so it is planned to adopt it. As for the special reserve as one-half or one-third of the inheritance share, it is also based on the severity of various relationships. (Not finished)</p>
<p>Hangzhou Express Letter</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Public Bonds include the old debt consolidation public bond, the post-disaster public bond, the old debt repayment public bond, and the highway public bond. This year, a construction public bond of 10 million yuan has been added, which is raised in four phases in April, June, August, and October. However, two phases have passed, and the amount subscribed is less than one-tenth. The end of August is approaching in an instant. In this situation of declining people's strength, it is feared that it will be difficult to reach the quota. It is reported that the Finance Department has telegraphed various county bureaus to do their best to raise funds to meet the needs.</p>

<p>Local News: The Father-Slaying Criminal Has Been Arrested</p>
<p>A Tragic Moral Catastrophe, Seeds of Disaster Planted Early</p>
<p>The Murderer Was Caught Just One Day After the Incident</p>
<p>Yesterday's report mentioned that Sun Laowu was assassinated, and his adopted son, Sun Liansheng, was highly suspected of patricide. Unexpectedly, the murderer was captured just one day later. Two accomplices, Qiu Shuntao and Qiu Lansheng, were also arrested successively. Sun Liansheng and Qiu Shuntao were both arrested in Tongzhou on the day before yesterday at noon and escorted to Shanghai. They confessed to the details of the patricide and the motives behind it. According to them, the deceased had an affair with Liansheng's wife, which drove the criminals to commit this heinous act. This tragic moral catastrophe is recorded for future reference in this case.</p>
<p>The Beginning and End of the Criminals' Arrest</p>
<p>Sun Laowu's tragic death occurred at 8:00 PM on the 27th. The next morning, his nephew, Sun Fusheng, learned of this and immediately sent an urgent telegram to his third uncle, Sun Xuewen, reporting the death of his fifth uncle and stating that if Sun Liansheng returned home, he should be arrested quickly to clarify the truth. Sun Xuewen is Sun Liansheng's biological father and a brother to the deceased. After receiving the telegram, he was extremely shocked. It was already noon when Sun Xuewen was washing rice by the river when he suddenly saw his son, Liansheng, and Qiu Shuntao walking together. Sun remained calm and pretended not to know anything. He greeted them into the house, prepared a meal for them, and then showed them the telegram, asking if the incident was true. Sun Liansheng knew that his crime had been exposed and denying it would be futile. He and Qiu Shuntao surrendered and boarded a ship to Shanghai. They arrived here yesterday morning and were taken to the Fifth District Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Motive for Patricide</p>
<p>After the two criminals were escorted to Shanghai, Qiu Lansheng, another accomplice, was arrested at No. 10, Anle Lane, Tanjiazhai. Including Ji Shuangquan, who had already been arrested, a total of four criminals have been apprehended. According to Sun Liansheng, the death of his stepfather, Sun Laowu, was his idea. He was furious because the deceased had an affair with his wife, Ji, and decided to take drastic action. Qiu Shuntao and others were the ones who actually killed Sun. Initially, Sun Liansheng had the intention of harming his stepfather and discussed it with Ji, who agreed to help but demanded 30 yuan as a reward. Sun Liansheng received 30 yuan in silver during the leap month of June in the lunar calendar and shared it with Ji. They then enlisted the help of Qiu Lansheng, Ji Shuangquan, and others.</p>
<p>As Many As Four Types of Weapons Used</p>
<p>Sun Liansheng and others sneaked into Sun Laowu's residence at 8:00 PM on the 27th and murdered Sun. It is said that they used four types of weapons: an iron hoe, a copper shovel, a sharp blade, and scissors. As a result, the deceased's body was covered in wounds, with severe injuries to the head, back, and chest. His body was riddled with holes, and blood and flesh were scattered everywhere. The scene was horrifying. After committing the crime, Sun Liansheng and Qiu Shuntao took the 12:00 AM Tongzhou steamer back home, while the other two remained in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the case was solved in less than a day, and all the criminals were arrested. It can be said that the net of heaven is vast, and criminals cannot escape punishment.</p>
<p>Guangdong Student Chen Kunrong's</p>
<p>Pitiful Suicide</p>
<p>Studies Not Progressing, Rejected by the School</p>
<p>Buying Medicine to End His Life, a Sorrowful Farewell</p>
<p>Chen Kunrong, 19 years old, the second son of Chen Shisheng from Guangdong, residing at No. 1, Sanyuan Lane, Qiujiang Road, North Sichuan Road, entered school at the age of seven and is currently studying at Guangzhao University. This year, he reached the third grade of junior high school in the first semester. Now, during the summer vacation at home, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. He secretly bought two bottles of tranquilizer pills from a pharmacy near Yokohama Bridge and took them secretly around 5:00 PM. Around 6:00 PM, his stepmother discovered this and immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. By the time he arrived at the hospital, he could not speak and was in critical condition. His usual temperament, the process of taking the medicine, his self-written suicide note, and his family situation are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>His Usual Temperament</p>
<p>Although Chen Kunrong entered school at a young age and has been studying for more than ten years, he is intellectually slow and has a strange temper. Therefore, he only reached the third grade of junior high school this year. He should have graduated during the vacation, but the school authorities decided to hold him back because his academic performance was insufficient and his grades were not up to par. Therefore, he has been depressed since the summer vacation and wanted to find a job in society to comfort himself. Although he repeatedly wrote letters to various places, recommending himself like Mao Sui, the results were all disappointing. (e.g., film companies, etc.)</p>
<p>The Process of Taking the Medicine</p>
<p>A few days ago, his stepmother gave Kunrong four yuan, instructing him to go to the school to register for the next semester because Kunrong and his younger brother had to return to Guangzhao to study. However, when Kunrong went to the school, the school only accepted his younger brother's registration fee and refused Kunrong's, stating that he did not need to come again next semester for studying. (It is said that the school refused to admit him because he had a bad temper at school, not only scolding and hitting his classmates but also being impolite to teachers.) After Kunrong returned home, he did not tell his mother and only presented his younger brother's receipt. When his mother asked for his own receipt, he replied that it would be needed tomorrow. The next day, his mother urged him to get the receipt again. Kunrong replied that the weather was too hot and he did not want to go, saying that it would not matter if he delayed it for a day or two. Then, yesterday afternoon, he took the two yuan registration fee and bought two bottles of tranquilizer pills at Yokohama Bridge. He returned home around 5:00 PM and had dinner with his mother and younger siblings at the same table. After dinner, he went to the back room of the living room to take a bath. He took the pills at this time. After bathing, he went out with his younger sister to cool off and chatted with friends at their homes in the front alley. He told his friends, "I have already taken tranquilizer pills." His friends did not believe him and joked, "If you want to die, you can jump into the Huangpu River. You don't even have money to buy food usually, how can you have money to buy tranquilizer pills?" At this point, Kunrong felt uneasy and showed them the two empty bottles of tranquilizer pills to prove it. After seeing the bottles, his friends believed him and told his younger sister to inform his mother. By this time, Kunrong was restless and went home first. His younger sister returned home and reported to his mother. His mother saw that Kunrong's face was pale and asked him what medicine he had taken. He replied that he had not taken any medicine. His mother immediately hired a car and sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He vomited a lot after the doctors administered treatment. However, as of 10:00 PM, he was still unable to speak. According to the doctors, it is still difficult to predict whether his life is in danger. If he can wake up tomorrow morning, he will likely be safe.</p>
<p>Self-Written Suicide Note</p>
<p>After Kunrong was admitted to the hospital, his stepmother found a blue-lined composition book next to him with a self-written suicide note. It is transcribed as follows: "Rong is now separating from you. I have received your teachings for nineteen years, but now, due to the oppression of the environment and all kinds of difficulties, I cannot overcome them and cannot do what I want. Therefore, I am incompetent in this world and must eliminate myself. I hope you will forgive or scold me. The unfilial Rong is my own problem, so you don't need to worry. Mother, take care of yourself and don't worry too much. Each of my younger siblings can help you a little. I hope you will always teach them. After I die, I hope you will say that I died of cholera. All matters will be handled by you. Don't panic. I am afraid that my humble body has lung disease or something else, and I will have to go sooner or later, so my departure is fine."</p>
<p>Family Situation</p>
<p>Chen Shisheng is currently working in the engine room of the Shuheng steamboat, traveling between Yichang and Chongqing. He returns home once a year (during the New Year) and sends dozens of yuan home every month for household expenses. His first wife bore him two sons and one daughter. The eldest daughter is married in Hankou, the second son is Kunrong, and the youngest son is seventeen years old and currently in Shanghai. After his first wife died, he married a stepmother, who also bore him two sons and one daughter. The youngest son died last year. There is still an eldest daughter and a second son. The second son is the one who studies at the same school as Kunrong. When the reporter went to the Chen family to inquire, he saw that his stepmother's face was full of sorrow and she seemed very sad. His younger siblings were also nearby, all silent and facing each other. The atmosphere was bleak and pitiful.</p>
<p>The Truth About Guo Jinsen's Suicide</p>
<p>Pressured to Marry by In-Laws, Ravaged by Communists</p>
<p>Overwhelmed with Emotions, He Ended His Life</p>
<p>Guo Jinsen, a 29-year-old from Jiangxi, recently lost his job and could not make a living. He was staying with his sister-in-law, Guo Peng, near Chenxiangge in the city. Since childhood, he had been betrothed to a woman from his hometown through a matchmaker, but the marriage had not yet been completed. Guo came to Shanghai to seek a living. Recently, he repeatedly received letters from his in-laws urging him to marry. Furthermore, Guo's home in his hometown was ravaged by the Communist Party, resulting in the destruction of his family. In this situation, Guo could not help but feel depressed. Recently, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts and swallowed opium the night before. He suffered a seizure and moaned in bed. His sister-in-law found out and immediately took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, he had been poisoned too deeply and died yesterday morning. After the director of the Second District First Station, Qian, found out about the incident, he summoned Guo Peng and interrogated her. He then reported to the local court to send someone to verify the death and arrange for burial.</p>
<p>Xia Laoer's Dead Child Comes Back to Life</p>
<p>Fainted and Placed in a Straw Sack, Abandoned in a Wasteland</p>
<p>A Man Carrying Dung Heard Crying and Found a Living Child</p>
<p>Xia Laoer, a 41-year-old from Suqian, Jiangbei, residing in a straw shed in Meifang Lane, Roberts Road, West Shanghai, made a living by setting up a secondhand goods stall. He had a son who was only three years old. On the evening of the 24th of this month, he suddenly fell ill, experiencing alternating chills and fever. Due to financial constraints, he did not seek medical treatment or take medicine. His condition worsened, and he fainted and became unconscious the day before yesterday afternoon. His limbs turned cold, and he died. Xia was grief-stricken and put the child's body in a straw sack and abandoned it in the wasteland behind the lane. (In the wastelands of West Shanghai, the bodies of children are a common sight.) Unexpectedly, around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, an old farmer carrying a dung bucket passed by the wasteland and suddenly heard a child crying in the straw sack. He looked down and saw a child inside. He was greatly shocked and ran to tell the nearby residents. Xia also heard about it and went to see. He saw that it was indeed his own child who had come back to life. He took the child home and gave him some soup, which he drank peacefully. As a result, the story spread far and wide, and people rushed to see, marveling at the miracle.</p>
<p>Outside Wusongkou</p>
<p>Water Police Seize Smugglers of Private Salt</p>
<p>Four People Confessed to Smuggling</p>
<p>Around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a sailboat, fully loaded with packages, was sailing swiftly from east to west in the waters of Qihangsha outside Wusongkou. At that time, Jiang Liang, a patrol officer from the 16th team of the 4th district of the Wusong Water Police, was patrolling the area on a patrol boat and noticed it. Suspecting that the boat was suspicious, he went forward and stopped it for inspection. Unexpectedly, the packages on the boat were all white salt, totaling more than seventy packages. There were four people on the boat, who were immediately detained and escorted to the Wusong team headquarters. Under interrogation by Captain Chen Xinsan, they confessed that their names were Bao Chaoyu, 57 years old, from Haizhou, Wang Chunyin, 53 years old, from Yancheng, Gao Shan, 45 years old, from Yancheng, and Qian Zhaowan, 25 years old, from Yancheng. The four confessed that they were smuggling to make a living. They borrowed money to transport goods and used it as capital to smuggle salt. The purchase price was 1.5 yuan per package, and the selling price was about 4 yuan. The remaining profit was divided among them for living expenses. They pleaded for leniency, saying that they were forced to do so by livelihood. After verifying the confession, Captain Chen determined that the case involved smuggling salt, which violated the ban. He sent a special document to the Wusong Anti-Smuggling First Brigade headquarters yesterday morning for further investigation.</p>
<p>Real Estate Transaction Status in July</p>
<p>Transaction Amount of 7 Million Taels</p>
<p>Although July is the peak of summer, the real estate market in Shanghai is still very prosperous. It is unprecedented for summer. According to a survey yesterday, the amount of real estate trade transactions this month exceeded 7 million taels, which is several times more than the 1.2 million taels in July last year. The transaction areas are still mainly in the Jing'an Temple Road area in West Shanghai and the French Concession. The original site of the Meifeng Bank on Nanjing Road has now been completely transferred.</p>
<p>Hu Xiangshan's Cohabitation Lawsuit Rejected</p>
<p>Axiu Has No Opinion and Suffers All Kinds of Hardship</p>
<p>Hu's Trickery Ultimately Comes to Nothing</p>
<p>Li Axiu, a woman from Jiading, is 30 years old this year. She lost both parents at a young age and was introduced by someone to the Zhang family in the countryside as a child bride. (Her fiancé's name is Agou.) Because she lacked food and clothing, Axiu came to Shanghai to work as a servant to support herself. At the age of seventeen, Axiu's aunt terminated the marriage contract with the Zhang family and returned 20 yuan in wedding gifts. Then, Axiu was introduced to Wu Agen, the son of Wu Ziqing, and officially married. They had a daughter, who is now eleven years old. When Axiu was 26 years old, she set up a fish stall business in the Nanmatou area and accumulated some savings. At that time, Hu Xiangshan, a man from Hubei, seduced her and claimed that he had no wife. Axiu was unaware and was tempted by him. She eloped with Hu. Axiu then learned that Hu still had a wife and regretted it. Unexpectedly, Hu was still unsatisfied, fearing that Wu Agen would find out and report him. So, he took preemptive action and sought out Axiu's former husband, Zhang Agou, to come to Shanghai and file a lawsuit against Wu Ziqing and Wu Agen in court. As a result, Axiu was sentenced to be taken back by Zhang Agou. However, Agou was incompetent, so Axiu still fell into Hu's hands and has been cohabitating with him for four years. All of Axiu's private savings and jewelry, worth about 600 yuan, have been squandered by Hu. Unexpectedly, recently, Hu became suspicious and ordered Axiu to return to Hubei. Axiu refused and was subjected to abuse and beatings. Unable to bear the suffering, Axiu left last month and temporarily stayed at her relative's house at No. 6, Xinjie, Nanshi. After Axiu left, Hu Xiangshan searched for her everywhere and found her in Nanshi. They were both taken to the police station in the Second District and then transferred to the local court prosecutor's office for interrogation and release. Now, Hu Xiangshan has filed a lawsuit with the local court, claiming that Li Axiu eloped and requesting a judgment ordering them to cohabitate. The trial was held by Judge Du the day before yesterday. Hu Xiangshan testified that he was 37 years old, from Hubei, and lived at No. 1223, Xujiahui. He said that he married Axiu with money, so Axiu's former husband, Zhang Agou, gave him the judgment to keep. He admitted that he had a wife and now wanted to cohabitate. The defendant, Li Axiu, testified about the previous events, saying that he (Hu Xiangshan) was a gigolo and that he had tricked her out of the money she made selling fish and deceived her into eloping. She said that although she knew she had been tricked, she could not do anything about it. Now, he repeatedly beat her and told her to get out, so she had to leave and stay at her relative's house. The judge asked, "Then you have no marital relationship with him?" She replied, "That's right." The judge asked when Zhang Agou filed the lawsuit, and she replied, "In September of the sixteenth year." The judge then said to Hu Xiangshan, "You have no marital relationship with her, and she doesn't want to be with you, so there is nothing you can do." The judge tried to mediate in court, but the plaintiff insisted on cohabitation, while the defendant requested to terminate the relationship. Therefore, the mediation failed. After the debate began, it was announced that the debate was over and a verdict would be announced later. Yesterday, the verdict was issued: Hu Xiangshan's lawsuit against Li Axiu for elopement was rejected, and the litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff.</p>
<p>Husband Not Husband, Wife Not Wife</p>
<p>Zhong Jiaqing's Marital Path Is Full of Suffering</p>
<p>Zhong Jiaqing, from Yancheng, who lives on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei, runs a secondhand goods business. He married a woman named Yuan, and they have a son who is nine years old. The couple has been harmonious, but recently Zhong lost his job, and his finances have become strained. Yuan was unwilling to share his poverty and secretly eloped at the beginning of last month. After losing his wife, Zhong searched everywhere, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, he accidentally met her in the underworld the night before and forced her to return home. Yuan had to go back with Zhong, but after living together for only a few days, Yuan tried to escape again. Zhong pleaded with her, but Yuan took out a paper cutter and stabbed her husband, cutting his finger. Zhong, seeing that she was such a fierce woman, found it difficult to reconcile with her. He immediately filed a complaint with the Fourth District General Office. After Zhong complained about the previous events, Yuan was questioned and said, "My husband is lazy and refuses to work. He has been idling for many years and has spent all of our money. I had no choice but to go to a small sister's house on Baohua Road in the city to stay temporarily. Unexpectedly, he falsely accused me of having an affair and forced me to take off my clothes and pawn them. I could not resist and took out a foreign knife to scare him, accidentally injuring his finger." After reviewing the confession, the director determined that the case involved a marital dispute and also involved injury, so it should be transferred to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<p>An Old Man Rapes His Child Bride</p>
<p>Wang Weigen's Moral Catastrophe</p>
<p>Wang Weigen, a 43-year-old from Nanjing who sells wontons and lives at No. 35, Xinkang Lane, Caojiadu, has a son named Wang Douzi, who is 17 years old. There is a child bride in the family, Wang Zhou, who is also 17 years old (i.e., Douzi's wife). However, Wang Weigen, because his old wife is stupid and ugly, imitated the behavior of animals and raped his child bride four times. He then wanted to take his daughter-in-law as a concubine and coerced his wife to agree. So, his wife, Wang Zhang, and her son and daughter-in-law filed a complaint with the Sixth District Police Station, which detained Wang Weigen and handed him over to the local court. The investigation has been completed, and Wang Weigen is prosecuted for rape and violation of public morals. The trial was held by Judge Zhao yesterday. The defendant, Wang Weigen, denied everything. When questioned, the child bride, Wang Zhou, testified in detail that she was raped by her father-in-law four times, which was the truth. Wang Zhang also testified that her husband's animalistic behavior was that he raped his daughter-in-law and then wanted to take her as a concubine. "I didn't agree, so he drove my son out and beat me. I can't bear the suffering, so I ask for an investigation." After the judge questioned them, he ordered the plaintiffs to leave and the defendant to be taken back into custody to await the verdict.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of the Explosion Death Case</p>
<p>Zhou Zhenqian, the owner of Sanhe Yong Tin Copper Shop in Liuwen Lane, Jiumudi, bought explosives, resulting in an explosion that killed two people and injured three others. The victims, Lu Daxin, Tang Xilin, Yan Dengshan, and others, filed a complaint with the local court prosecutor's office, accusing Ji Huoting, the owner of the Jidelin Wood Shop, of handling everything alone and not reporting the accident. After submitting the injuries for inspection, Prosecutor Zhao ordered both parties to be summoned for a hearing. Yesterday, only the plaintiffs arrived, while the defendants did not appear in court. Therefore, the prosecutor ordered another summons. The prosecutor also found that the place was in the Jiumu area, and since such a major homicide occurred at the time,</p>

<p>Jipingyang, the local head, did not report the incident, which was obviously inappropriate. Therefore, he was also summoned for a thorough investigation.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Foghorn at Dongpeng Island Lighthouse</p>
<p>A notice from Xi Bu, Inspector of the Maritime Affairs Section of the Customs, states: This Inspector has learned that the Dongpeng Island Lighthouse, under the jurisdiction of the Shantou Customs, has established a foghorn. The details are listed below.</p>
<p>Shantou Dongpeng Island Lighthouse has established a first-class echo foghorn, which is expected to be put into use around August 22nd. It will be implemented at that time, and no further notice will be given. The foghorn will sound twice per minute in hazy weather and heavy fog. Each sound will last for one and a half seconds, followed by a three-second pause, then another one and a half seconds, followed by a 54-second pause. Please pay attention. The ending sound of the foghorn is quite deep, which is to lower the sound. Its axis is pointing towards the Qinzi area. Therefore, it is hereby notified for compliance. All ships should pay attention and remember the details to avoid negligence. Do not forget, do not neglect. July 24th, Republic of China Year 19.</p>
<p>Letter Requesting Careful Inspection of Buildings</p>
<p>A Letter from the Taxpayers Association to the Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>"We are writing to inform you that according to reports in various local newspapers on July 25th, the newly built houses at No. 153, Jing'an Temple Road, near Muller Road, consisting of six houses, suddenly collapsed on the third floor of the easternmost four houses around 3:15 PM on the afternoon of the 24th, injuring a plasterer's apprentice and a passerby. All building plans in the concession are approved by your Public Works Department before construction can begin, and old buildings are also inspected by your Public Works Department from time to time to determine their safety. Therefore, your Public Works Department is responsible for ensuring the safety of building construction and is trusted by the residents. Now, there is no doubt that the building plans for the houses in question were approved by your Public Works Department. However, the new houses collapsed before they were completed, indicating that your Public Works Department was either negligent in reviewing the plans or negligent in subsequent inspections. The negligence of duty is the same. Fortunately, the new houses collapsed before the residents moved in. If they had collapsed after the residents moved in, not only would more than two people have been injured, but countless people would have died. Your Public Works Department cannot escape the responsibility for negligence of duty leading to death and injury. Furthermore, due to this incident, the residents of the concession have a major impact on their trust in your Public Works Department. All buildings approved and inspected by your department may collapse and cause death and injury. The severity of the situation is evident. Moreover, there are rumors that some people are manipulating the review and inspection of construction matters due to certain relationships. Although there is no concrete evidence, public opinion is formidable and should be taken into account. This is merely a related matter that we are reporting. We are sending this letter to request that you investigate and handle the case strictly to ensure the safety of the residents and maintain the reputation of your department. This matter is of great importance and should not be handled leniently due to personal relationships."</p>

<p>The Special District Local Court has scheduled to publicly burn the opium confiscated in cases on July 30th, as reported in the previous newspaper. Today is the scheduled date, and the opium burning time is set for 10:00 AM. The location is the Tongren Baoantang Yizhongdi at the corner of Beizhejiang Road and Qipu Road, south of the court. The area is surrounded by walls, making it easy to manage during the burning. The opium to be burned this time was confiscated in cases within the three months from the establishment of the Special District Court on April 1st to June 30th. However, opium cases that have not yet been finalized will be temporarily stored in the warehouse and burned next time.</p>
<p>The types and weights of opium to be burned this morning are listed below:</p>
<p>Opium: 167 pounds and three-quarters, plus 462 taels, 2 mace, and 2 fen in English weight, plus 18 small pieces, plus 93 small packages, plus 21 small boxes, plus 1 small can, plus 29 taels of opium paste in English weight, plus 21 small cans, plus 4 small boxes, plus 2 small jars, plus half a small can.</p>

<p>Zheng Guohua Forged Fake Silver Drafts</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years in Prison</p>
<p>Zheng Guohua, from Jiaxing, recently ordered a box of bamboo cloth, totaling 50 pieces, worth 500 taels, from Baotai Foreign Goods Company on Tianjin Road. Zheng claimed to be an employee of Xie Daxing Foreign Goods Company in Xiaodongmen and provided a silver draft of 500 taels from Hongfeng Money Shop, arranging to pick up the goods the next day. After Zheng left, the accountant of Baotai noticed that the Hongfeng seal on the silver draft had some unusual points. He immediately sent an apprentice to Hongfeng to verify it, and it turned out to be forged. His colleagues Zhou Boping and others searched for Zheng everywhere and found him at the Old Sassoon Foreign Company on Hong Kong Road. Although Zheng did not cheat the goods, he should not have forged fake silver drafts. Therefore, he was taken to the police station. It was learned that Zheng's fake seals and other items were hidden at Shunxing Pawnshop at No. 1093, Longmen Road. Patrol officer Zhang Xiaolin was dispatched to search and found a return receipt book and a printing vat in addition to the fake seals. Yesterday, he was brought to the Special District Local Court for trial by Judge Zhou. The police lawyer, Gan Jingxian, requested a strict investigation, while the defendant claimed that the seals and other items were given to him by Liu Tingyu from Sichuan. Judge Zhou verified the confession and sentenced Zheng Guohua to three years in prison, and the fake seals and other items were confiscated.</p>
<p>A Daughter Hidden Away and Missing</p>
<p>Zhang Zheng, who lives at No. 6, Taiping Lane, Xiafei Road, French Concession, filed a complaint with the criminal court of the French Concession yesterday, stating that his daughter used to work in a sock factory, but the day before yesterday, she was abducted and hidden away by Sun Adong, whom she knew. Therefore, he brought Sun to court to request an investigation. When questioned, Sun Adong stated that the complainant used to run a restaurant in Dasheng Lane, Ximen Road, and had been living with the plaintiff. Recently, because his daughter was working in a sock factory, he had been taking care of her at his home. He said that it had been two months since she had come to see him, and he did not know where she was. He denied abducting her and requested an investigation. Judge Zhu ordered the defendant to post bail and adjourned the hearing for seven days.</p>
<p>Repercussions of the Stolen Photograph Case</p>
<p>The Zhenru Fourth District Third Sub-Bureau recently arrested Gu Ayou for breaking into Li Xue's house and stealing photographs. The outside world is unclear about the truth and suspects that there are other hidden circumstances. According to another source, this incident was actually to seize property. Because the Xue family is well-off and vulnerable as a widow, a local bully has been coveting her for some time. He secretly instructed Gu Ayou, a distant relative of the family who can be used, to steal photographs to defame her and find an excuse. However, Ayou's stealing skills were too poor and were seen by the tenants Zhou and Li, who reported the incident to the police. Ayou was angry that the two had reported him. In his testimony at the bureau, he slandered Zhou and Li for having an affair with Xue. He did not know that Zhou and Li were students Zhou Chuanfeng and Li Shaobai from Jinan University, who always conducted themselves with caution. They always avoided getting close to female students. Their peers considered them young moralists and would never have any improper behavior with a middle-aged rural woman. Now, Gu Ayou has been sentenced by the Shanghai Local Court. It is said that he will file a lawsuit for defamation and will also implicate the local bully who instructed him.</p>
<p>Gu Caiyun Dies After Falling While Installing Glass</p>
<p>Gu Caiyun, a 31-year-old carpenter from Ningbo at He Fuju Wood Shop on Wuma Road, went to Xiang Shen Tai Leather Shop on Qipan Street, Wuma Road, yesterday morning to install a glass skylight.

<p>Yu Dacheng Dies After Hitting His Head</p>
<p>Yu Dacheng, a salesman from Ningbo at Xinchangxiang Hardware Shop on East Broadway Road, was ordered by the shop owner yesterday morning to deliver goods to Pudong. The sampan he was riding in was tossed around by the strong waves and collided with another sampan. Yu Dacheng was injured on the head. Around 2:00 PM, Chinese police officer No. 2686 from the Sima Road Police Station sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. Around 4:00 PM, he died due to the severity of his injuries.</p>
<p>A Shop Assistant Dies After Falling from a Truck</p>
<p>Jiang Ruyun, a 35-year-old shop assistant from Wenzhou who has been working for the No. 9463 freight truck of the Transportation Company on the Jielu Road of the North Railway Station for six or seven years, went out to work with the truck yesterday afternoon. Jiang, relying on his rich experience, stood directly on the truck when it was moving very fast, without sitting down. However, when the truck passed Huade Road, the road was uneven, and the truck was moving fast. The truck body bounced violently, and Jiang accidentally fell off the truck, hitting his head first. He was severely injured. Around 4:00 PM, Chinese police officer No. 905 from the Yangshupu Police Station sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. He died around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Ling Runxiang's Body Examined Yesterday</p>
<p>Investigated Reactionaries Before Incident</p>
<p>Killed by Thugs on the Way Home</p>
<p>Ling Runxiang, the former Chinese Deputy Inspector of the Hongkou Police Station, from Panyu, Guangdong, 36 years old, became an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau after resigning. He was a good performer. At 11:00 PM the night before, he and his concubine, Zhang, went out from No. 634, Dexing Lane, Beijiangxi Road, and encountered a thug with a pistol in his hand when they reached the entrance of the lane. Ling saw that the situation was not good and also drew his pistol, grabbing the thug's hand to prevent him from firing. The thug was very strong and broke free from Ling's hand, striking him in the head with a shot. Ling was caught off guard and fell to the ground, dying immediately. As the thug fled, he fired another shot, hitting Wu Shen, the mother of Wu Yuanchang, the owner of the Yinzhi shop at the entrance of the lane. She has been hospitalized for treatment. At that time, the police station also sent detectives to the scene of the incident to investigate. Ling's body was taken to the Feilun Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Xu Mei, the prosecutor from the Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to verify the identity of the body. The concubine, Zhang, testified that her husband had gone to the Mainland Hotel to investigate the reactionaries before the incident and returned home without any results. On the way, they encountered two men in short clothes, one in white and one in black. Her husband thought these two men were strange, but he did not expect them to be the thugs. Now, all of her relatives and friends have arrived and want to see her husband's body. Therefore, she came to claim the body to take it home. The court then announced that the deceased Ling Runxiang had been shot in the head and killed. The police station was ordered to arrest the murderer and investigate the case. The body was handed over to the deceased's concubine, Ling Zhang, to arrange for burial.</p>
<p>Two Floating Corpses</p>
<p>Around 5:00 AM yesterday morning, an unidentified male corpse was found floating at the Bund Wharf on Beijing Road.

<p>An Elderly Woman Burned While Watching a Funeral</p>
<p>A Young Man Smoking and Striking a Match</p>
<p>The Elderly Woman Standing Next to a Liquor Barrel Suffered</p>
<p>Around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a funeral procession for the Hu family was passing through Tangjia Lane on North Fujian Road. Several shop assistants from Wan Changtai Sauce Garden were transporting four barrels of sorghum liquor in a small truck. Because they could not pass through, they stopped there. The shop assistants also stopped to watch. An elderly woman from Shaoxing, Dai Huang, 63 years old, who also</p>

<p>On April 1, 1930, there were 2,707 vehicles, an increase of 120 vehicles compared to the previous period. Freight vehicles are also divided into private and public categories. The number of both types increased at a similar rate. The number of motorcycles increased from 508 to 613 in the International Settlement, and from 85 to 90 in the French Concession. The significant increase is likely due to the spring and summer seasons, as more people tend to ride bicycles during this time.</p>
<p>American-made cars are the most numerous in Shanghai. Among the twenty-three registered brands, more than one hundred are registered. Sixteen of these brands are American. The top four brands are British cars. France accounts for two brands, and Italy for one, the Fiat. According to previous statistics, Buick ranks first, followed by Ford, which is trying to overtake it. There are 992 Buick cars, 907 Ford cars, and Chevrolet ranks third with 657 cars. Morris Cowley is fourth with 522 cars, and Fiat is fifth with 475 cars. Studebaker is close behind with 453 cars. Citroen ranks seventh with 408 cars. None of the brands below exceed 400 cars.</p>
<p>Among the various car brands, the registration of Renaults is surprisingly higher than that of Hupmobile. The increase began on April 1. Renault now ranks fifteenth, while Hupmobile has dropped to sixteenth. The style of Renault cars is even considered inferior to that of Hupmobile, which is worth studying. Austin cars have also declined significantly, ranking twentieth. No Morris cars are used for rental purposes, which is something Morris car owners can take pride in. In addition, various other famous cars, except for the Standard brand, can be found among public passenger cars.</p>
<p>Although the number of Buick cars is the highest among various cars in Shanghai, if Ford cars include freight vehicles, then their number is the largest in Shanghai, totaling 1,682 vehicles. Buick ranks second, Chevrolet third with 942 vehicles, and Morris fourth with 878 vehicles. Studebaker freight vehicles have 306 vehicles, and Renault has 127 vehicles. The number of cars is as mentioned above, but it is difficult to investigate the amount of business, because in addition to the vehicles in Shanghai, many have not been registered before. Moreover, there are many government agencies and military uses in other areas, which cannot be fully counted for the time being.</p>
<p>The following table shows the number of various popular passenger and freight vehicles on Shanghai roads on April 1, 1930. In the International Settlement, there were 4,865 private passenger cars, 551 public passenger cars, 731 private freight vehicles, 848 public freight vehicles, and 508 motorcycles. In the French Concession, there were 3,147 private passenger cars, 475 public passenger cars, 654 private freight vehicles, 474 public freight vehicles, and 85 motorcycles. On July 1, 1930, in the International Settlement, there were 5,046 private passenger cars, 560 public passenger cars, 771 private freight vehicles, 869 public freight vehicles, and 613 motorcycles. In the French Concession, there were 3,214 private passenger cars, 484 public passenger cars, 690 private freight vehicles, 497 public freight vehicles, and 90 motorcycles.</p>

<h3>Thoughts After Reading Guangzhou's Automobile Statistics</h3>
<p>Guangzhou's automobile industry, while second to Shanghai, Wuhan, Beijing, and Tianjin, surpasses other regions. After reading the newly published "First Municipal Statistics of Guangzhou," the various statistics on the automobile industry need to be disclosed in this publication, and are recorded to observe the current situation of Guangzhou's automobile industry, and to urge its consistent progress.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Country of Various Automobiles</h3>
<p>Most of the automobiles running in Guangzhou are purchased from foreign countries, including ordinary cars, freight vehicles, and long-distance passenger vehicles. Among the ordinary cars, 414 vehicles are purchased from the United States and Canada, 24 from Italy, 20 from the United Kingdom, 5 from France, 3 from Germany, and 12 from other countries, totaling 478 vehicles. Among the freight vehicles, 44 vehicles are purchased from the United States and Canada, 5 from the United Kingdom, and 2 from other countries, totaling 51 vehicles. Among the long-distance passenger vehicles, 50 vehicles are from the United States and Canada, 2 from Italy, and 5 from the United Kingdom, totaling 57 vehicles. In summary, our country purchases the most automobiles from the United States, resulting in a huge loss of profits annually. Considering the statistics by manufacturing country, how should the domestic automobile industry pay attention and think about manufacturing domestic cars to regain rights?</p>
<h3>Statistics on Automobile Accidents and Injuries</h3>
<p>According to the municipal statistics, pages 298 to 300, there are statistics on the number of automobile accidents and injuries from 1928 and January to June 1929. In 1928, there were 206 automobile accidents, resulting in 5 male and 2 female deaths, 17 male and 4 female serious injuries, and 199 male and 42 female minor injuries. In 1929, from January to June only, there were 125 accidents, resulting in 2 male and 2 female deaths, 11 male and 4 female serious injuries, and 115 male and 26 female minor injuries, totaling 160 injuries. A comparison shows that automobile accidents and injuries are gradually increasing, which is not a blessing for the automobile industry and the local area. Therefore, drivers should be extra cautious to ensure the safety of passengers, and management should pay close attention to ensure the progress of the business. Otherwise, automobile companies will frequently encounter accidents, incur repair costs, and suffer significant losses. Pedestrians and merchants will be injured, causing unexpected disasters and adverse consequences, which is very unfortunate.</p>
<h3>Survey of Long-Distance Bus Companies</h3>
<p>In Guangzhou, in addition to ordinary cars and freight vehicles, there are eleven companies operating long-distance bus services, including Li Xing, Li Min, Model, National, Dao Xing, Guang An, Welfare, Guangdong East, Li An, Dong An, and Transport. Although the establishment dates vary, most have a term of three years, with the shortest being one year. As for the number of vehicles, Li Xing, Li Min, Model, and National each have five vehicles, Dao Xing and Welfare have ten vehicles, Guangdong East has six vehicles, Li An has seven vehicles, and Transport has four vehicles. Dong An has the most with thirty vehicles. The daily income per vehicle also varies greatly, depending on the length of the route and the prosperity of the business. The lowest is only one yuan and sixty cents, while the highest is one hundred and forty-seven yuan. Several companies earn between twenty-three yuan and ten yuan. Below that, the earnings are even more uneven, ranging from above six yuan to above four yuan. Considering the operation of long-distance buses in Guangzhou, there are as many as eleven companies competing at the same time. Although the routes are different, mutual jealousy is unavoidable. Therefore, from the perspective of municipal administration, long-distance buses should be urged to proceed to facilitate transportation, and the daily income should be increased to enrich the source of funds. The collection of fees should be eased to foster strength. From the perspective of automobile companies, how should they ensure the safety of passengers, the smoothness of roads, the reduction of injuries, and the caution of operations to ensure the development of the business?</p>
<h3>Regarding Automobile Matters in Municipal Statistics</h3>
<p>The municipal statistics cover more than just these three items. Other information, such as the registration of various vehicles, the number of passengers carried, as well as tables on capacity, speed, and fuel consumption, are also detailed. However, readers find the above three items to be more important, and hope to promote the improvement of the automobile industry in Guangzhou. Therefore, I do not mind the cost of words and write this afterward.</p>

<h3>French Labor Unrest in the North</h3>
<p>Textile Industry Declares General Strike</p>
<p>Opposition to the Implementation of the Insurance Law</p>
<p>Reuters, Lille, 28th: Textile workers have now declared a general strike in opposition to the newly established national insurance law. The workers are demanding wage increases based on current living costs; otherwise, they will not recognize this insurance law. As of July 26th, 15,000 textile workers had already gone on strike due to employers refusing wage increases. Also, 60% of metalworkers are on strike. In the Roanne area, there are also strikes against the implementation of the insurance law. Police are patrolling the streets and clashed with strikers outside the city hall, detaining several people.</p>
<h3>New Situation in German Political Parties</h3>
<p>A Tendency Towards Unification</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 28th: German political parties have traditionally been numerous small parties, each independent. Now, in this general election, there is a noticeable trend towards unification. Some defectors from the German National People's Party have begun working to organize a new coalition between the right-wing and centrist parties. The leader of the Democratic Party has also followed suit, issuing a declaration today proposing to unite the Democratic Party, the National People's Party, and the Young German Order to form a National Party. It is said that the Conservative National People's Party, newly formed by left-leaning members of the National People's Party, is not opposed to this move. However, the National People's Party's official declaration states that the issue of forming a new party has not yet been decided. It is said that the Democratic Party will hold a meeting before the end of this week to make a final decision. If the aforementioned union of conservatives and liberals can be established, the political parties in this election will be divided into the following factions: the National Socialist Party on the extreme left; the German National People's Party on the right; the aforementioned coalition planned by some defectors from the National People's Party on the center-right; the Catholic Center Party in the center; and if the aforementioned union of the Democratic Party and the National People's Party cannot be realized, there will be the National Party and the National People's Party on the center-left; the Social Democratic Party on the left; and the Communist Party on the extreme left. If this move succeeds, it can be said to be a very important step forward in the unity of German political life and political work, and it can also reduce the power of the extreme left and right wings.</p>
<h3>Indian Industry in Decline</h3>
<p>Most Weavers are Unemployed</p>

<p>National News Agency, New York, 28th: The US Treasury Department today refused entry to two Soviet merchant ships carrying timber, on the grounds that the goods were produced by prison labor.</p>
<p>National News Agency, New York, 28th: The Wage Maintenance Committee, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, recently planned to carry out propaganda to boycott the import of Soviet raw materials into the United States, on the grounds that these raw materials are derived from forced labor, which is not permitted by American policy.

<h3>Japanese Government's Policy Towards the Privy Council</h3>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: It is an established fact that the Privy Council will vigorously question the government when deliberating on the London Treaty. The government is also preparing to ensure that the replies are appropriate. Regarding the main points, it has been decided to reply as follows: 1. Regarding the negotiations with the United Kingdom and the United States, the sending of replies and the signing of the treaty, it has been said that the plenipotentiary Wakatsuki did not respect the will of the plenipotentiary of the Ministry of Finance, but the reports of the proceedings in the conference were all signed by the plenipotentiary of the Ministry of Finance, and it should not become a problem. 2. The Anglo-Japanese compromise plan was not decided solely by the will of the United Kingdom, but was based on the Japanese Navy, as evidenced by the facts. 3. The exchange of memorandums between the Chief of Naval General Staff and the Minister of the Navy is a matter within the Ministry of the Navy and is not known to the government. 4. The shortcomings of military strength exist not only in Japan but also in the United Kingdom and the United States, and will be carried out within the scope permitted by the budget. 6. The procedures for consulting the Privy Council on the arms reduction treaty are carried out for political reasons, and the decision of the reply is absolutely not a necessary condition for requesting consultation with the Privy Council. 7. Japan's claims at the 1935 Arms Reduction Conference are not subject to any restrictions, so its claims are being reconsidered.</p>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: The Privy Council plans to have Hanaga, who is recuperating, return to Tokyo from Karuizawa this morning to continue reviewing the London Treaty. However, it is not certain whether the review will be completed by the end of this week. Kuratomi, the President of the Privy Council, is considering taking expedient measures, taking into account the government's desire to ratify the treaty quickly, without waiting for the review meeting to be completed, namely opening a detailed investigation committee. As for Prime Minister Hamaguchi's attitude towards the Privy Council, it has become increasingly tough. He declared to the cabinet members that he would not visit the commissioners or key members of the Privy Council for fear of being misunderstood as an understanding movement. Also, regarding the head of the detailed investigation, Ito Jidaiji, because of a sore on his head, is recuperating, and it will probably be replaced by Tairaji Kiichiro.</p>
<h3>Wind Disaster Between Kyushu and Taiwan</h3>

<h3>Inventing a New Method of Storing Raw Cocoons</h3>
<p>Electric News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: Professor Miyake Bunjiro of Tokyo Higher Sericulture School, as a result of hard research, has invented a method of cold storage for raw cocoons. This new storage equipment is currently being installed under the direction of the professor at the Katakura Silk Mill in Kumagaya Town. According to this method, there is no need for the conventional raw cocoon drying equipment, and only a warehouse is sufficient. Moreover, it can avoid the deterioration of silk quality caused by drying, so the silk quality can be improved by 20%, and the silk production rate can be improved by 25%. Assuming that Japan's cocoon production is worth 1 billion yen, this method of storing raw cocoons can yield a profit of 200 million yen.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts After the Italian Earthquake</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 28th: According to the latest news from the disaster area, the work of searching for bodies and rescuing people in the rubble is progressing rapidly due to the efforts of the military, civilians, and various rescue teams of the Red Cross. The President of the Italian Red Cross, Duchess of Aosta, although weak and sickly, still braved the heat to visit the villages and towns to comfort the victims, even the most isolated villages were visited one by one. Food in the disaster area has been adequately supplied. Those who have no homes are all living in temporary shelters, where the poor and rich live together, and each does a considerable amount of work. The Italian King has returned to Rome and allocated 100,000 lira from the privy purse to support the relief efforts. Prime Minister Mussolini has been working day and night since he came from the earthquake area. Now that the government affairs have been slightly asked about, he will take the time to personally go to the disaster area to supervise the progress of the relief efforts.</p>
