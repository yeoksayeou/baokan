<p>時評</p>
<h3>世界失業問題</h3>
<p>失業問題。現幾成爲世界最重要問題。貧弱之民族。不必論矣。即最富强之國。若美若英若日若德均爲工業最發達者。又爲資本之最富足。者且於此失業問題。無法解决。况於其他各國乎。</p>
<p>據美政府救濟失業之辦法。以備欵建築。爲銷納失業工人之具。蓋深知失業工人之多。大抵由於貨物之供過於求。世界銷售地之力量。日形薄弱。假使銷納失業者於工塲。則製造愈多。而貨物之供過於求益。甚銷售愈難。而工廠之失敗。勢必益增失業之人。故用之於建築。非爲產生貨物之具。决不至增加其他工人之失業也。即如近來之金貴問題。亦即貨物過多。因而致賤之一表現也。</p>
<p>要之世界之失業問題。實即世界貨物過多問題。故欲解决失業問題。非先解决貨物過多問題不可。以求財易而勢力少。胥山野村落之人。而趨於市厘。宜乎貨物日益多。而購買之力日益弱。致有失業者日多之現象。自今以往。如事救濟。其必趨於開闢地利之一途歟。</p>

<p>（一）本黨爲負有實現三民主義之使命的革命黨、舉凡本黨同志、自應追隨總理之後、忠貞不貳爲三民主義作艱苦的奮鬥、雖革命前途之障礙頗多、而吾人完成革命之决心、則愈堅定、吾人試迴顧一年來因國内叛逆之紛起與夫國際間反動潮流之高漲、非惟不足以屈吾人之志抑且愈使吾人知所感奮者、即其明證、當茲第六次全市代表大會舉行之際、吾人敢將過去之環境實際的奮鬥、與夫未來之期望、竭誠爲同胞同志吿、</p>
<p>（二）在過去一年中、内國政治史上最重要的一頁、即爲國軍編遺會議之召集、國軍編遣會議、於一月一日開幕、而事實上、則於五日開議、於二十五日閉幕、此爲今後中國眞正和半統一之起點、亦爲去年一切叛徒之總因、即目前閻錫山之企圖顚覆政府、亦未始非種因於此、查當時岀席編遣會議之當然委員有二十三人、均爲在政治上軍事上負有非常重大之任務者集議經旬、决議二十餘案、分部分區、各專責成、當時全國軍額、有百五十餘萬、預計裁存八十萬、自總司令部以次各集團總司令及軍長、均行取銷軍權軍餉、均由中央分配處置、會議結果、成績斐然迨會議閉幕、各省次第奉行、亦有相當成績、詎知不逾月而李宗仁僭令免魯滌平職、造成桂系軍閥的叛變、於是全部編遣計劃、計遭一度挫折、幸賴中央之努力、卒將叛亂漸次盪平、復於八月一日、召集國軍實施編遣會議、集會七次、决議十六案、以期實行、民衆團體、復紛紛組織裁兵恊會、以資監督、乃不幸又有馮系軍閥與夫張發奎唐生智之叛變、最近、閻錫山更急起而效尤之、使全部編遣計劃之實行、均坐是而停頓、惟由於此等叛亂、使吾人獲一嚴重的敎訓、即封建軍閥、惟知豢養私兵霸佔地盤、决不希望中國統一彼輩亦知民心厭亂、因故作和平之詞、而不知和平之基礎、實需築於統一局面之上、舍統一而言和平、實無異撥油救火、今閻錫山亦以此和平兩字、爲煽惑之資料、國人固早已窺知其用意、亦羣信閻錫山之末日、行將不遠、吾人深知封建軍閥之勢力、不漸歸消滅、眞正和平統一的基礎、必不能鞏固、吾人過去對於討伐叛逆擁護編遣會議之工作、所以施行不遺餘力者、均本此深信而盡吾人之責任也、政治上的叛亂、旣如上述、而思想上之叛亂、亦有可得而言者、自第二次全國代表大會舉行而後、國府厲行訓政時期之建設工作、凡可以爲民造福者、無不努力以赴之、於是四月二十日、有保障人權令之公布不意此保障人權之命令、乃引起思想叛亂者叛跡之暴露、如胡適之輩、竟明目張膽、詆毀本黨、並辱及本黨總理、惟是吾人深信、本黨根據三民主義、以民衆利益爲中心觀念、凡足以阻礙中國國民革命成功之勢力、本黨均將以最大努力、與之搏戰、使之無由滋長、故過去對於思想上之叛逆、務戢止之、而使受正義之制裁者、均因吾人堅定的信仰有以致之也、内國叛變之紛起、自積極方面言之、均足爲鞭策吾人、使吾前進之動力、故吾人非惟無所畏怯、抑且並加奮勉、不幸多事之中國、除政治國難思想國難而外、又有所謂經濟國難之發生、夫自畢德門條約廢止、印度籌使金本位、繼之日本之金解禁、大戰後歐洲實業恢復、頻年銀產增加之結果、而金貴銀賤之風潮以起、我國對於改良幣制、尚成虛語、各國皆用金、而我國獨用銀、以致旬日之間、國富的價値、更見一層低落、國民生計、乃更受一層壓迫、國家的財政、更多一層損失、此種經濟國難、其危害民族的力量、實較政治困難爲大、吾人深信欲自拯滅亡、惟有從實際方面奬勵生產事業、於最近時期、力謀輸岀入貨物的平衡、俾内地經濟、基礎鞏固、交通恢復、人民生活安寗、而復從事於實現總理之錢幣革命之主張、吾人過去、對於經濟國難、亦曾有所貢獻、均爲本此深信而發生者也、至於外交方面、吾人所感受者、無一非慘痛悲苦之結晶、第一自去年七月十日、中東路事件發生以來、俄人横暴侵略、無所不用其極、直至十二月美法以非戰公約發起國的資格、通吿中俄各自遵守公約、他國紛起勸吿、形勢稍見緩和、俄方見狡計已逞、遂亦表示願重開中俄和議直接談判、我國派代表蔡運升赴伯力、舉行中俄預備會議、作初步的接洽、不料蔡運升越權訂立草約十項、遂引起國人之責難、國府乃召中東路督辦莫德惠晋京、籌商糾正辦法、結果、（共得四項、頗能挽救弊害、惟因中俄交涉而遭受之損失、實　民國以來之新元全國民衆最大之悲痛、莫逾於此第二、過去一年中、外交當局對廢的一事、似已進行不遺餘力、惟除使無關重要之墨西哥自動放棄領事裁判權外、所謂具體的成績何在、頗不易解答屢次致牒英美法等國要求取消領事裁判權、均遭拒絶、結果殆等於零、至於日本名爲期满、而在事實上特權亦並未實行放棄、僑居我國的日人、至今仍歸該國領事審判、尤足證明領判權的法律、根據雖已消失、而事實上的存在、仍足侵害中國的領土與主權、吾人於悲痛之餘、所以不能不希望外交當局本總理遺敎、以採取斷然手段者也、上述二項爲外交上犖犖之大事、吾人對此、亦曾努力爲種種之宣傳、俾民衆得起而爲中央政府之後盾、惟因環境不良、宣傳之效能减去不少、且在國際宣傳方面、亦未加注意、此則爲吾人所引爲疚心者也、</p>
<p>（三）就國際方面言、過去一年中、國際帝國主義間的衝突、已尖銳化表面上和平之聲、似依然甚高實則各帝國主義者間、於添造砲艦擴張軍備準備向全世界弱小民族厮殺的準備上則加緊努力茲分别說明如次（一）自開洛格非戰公約成立帝國主義者均一致譽爲人類和平之曙光、實則在此公約中除幾句因襲的空洞的條文以外、對於如何防止戰爭、如何消除軍備之切實方法絲毫未曾規定而事實上各國莫不從事於擴張大型戰鬥艦濳水艇·飛機·陸軍等等驚人之計劃、且自公約公布後、波蘭立陶宛之戰爭法國對摩洛哥叙利亞之進攻、以及赤俄向我國施暴在我國境内實地施大屠殺、而非戰公約簽約國均未聞發半句公平之言益足證明此種公約純爲粉飾和平之一種名詞、吾人過去對於此點、曾向民衆有所說明矣（二）歷史詔示吾人所謂國際聯盟乃帝國主義分贓的集團與十九世紀之神聖同盟、實趨一致故聯盟之裁軍會議、無異爲解决弱小民族而舉行者故去年四月十五日聯盟裁軍會議　幕吾國代表提廢除微兵制之案、而終無結果者益足證明吾人預測之無誤對於此點、吾人曾揭破其内幕、俾迷信世界和平統一可以從此種方式獲得者、有所驚惕也、（三）聯盟之裁軍會議吾人已指斥其自欺欺人矣、而裁軍會議之後、又有所謂五國倫敦海軍軍縮會議之舉行此種集議、與聯盟之裁軍會議初無二致均爲帝國主義者爲挽回衰頽的末運而起之分贓會議也、最近因濳艇的存廢問題補助艦的比例問題、有已近破裂的趨勢此爲帝國主義自露其兇殘的面目之一幕、努力說明此種會議之内幕俾吾國民衆有所驚惕者吾人之責任亦吾人過去曾有之努力、（四）過去一年的國際形勢雖因德國賠償問題之解决與萊因撤兵之實行、而呈現新的安定　實則第二次世界大戰之禍胎、早經濳伏一朝遇導火線即將暴裂、吾人試觀所謂列强之軍費預算、如美國較前年陸軍增一六四○○○、○○○美金、海軍增三一七、三一○○○○美金、法國去年之預算爲二、</p>

<p>字林報云、就此次工部局議董選舉之結果推測、投票人似甚注重工部局之舉措當求公開一事、蓋當選諸人、多贊成公開者也、安諾德惜以公忙未暇發表對此之意見、致失其位、馬賽氏則切實反對此議、致亦落選、</p>
<p>本届公共租界工部局、改選董事、日本候補人福島齊藤二人、獲得票數最多、故由日僑阿端·米里·林雄吉·三人（均各日僑團體之領袖）發起、於明晚（七日）假座日僑俱樂部、舉行慶功宴、一方慶祝當選人獲選、并慰勞總分部職員、一方商議擴張日市民之權利、聞將有多數提案、提交本届董事會、採納實行云、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>▲甲女——我不嫁與一個我所不愛的人。</p>
<p>乙女——倘有一個擁資千萬的大人物向你求婚時。那你怎麽樣。</p>
<p>甲女——那我當然愛他也當然要嫁給他了。</p>
<p>▲妻——哎喲不好了。孩子把你剃鬍子用的小刷子咽下去了。</p>
<p>夫——何必大驚小怪。這刷子用了半年。已在脫毛。我本來不要了。</p>
<p>▲女——爹爹。你爲甚麽悶悶不樂。敢是爲了阿丙就要來娶我去麽。</p>
<p>父——不是的。你去了再好没有。只怕他仍要把你送回來。</p>
<p>▲律師（給一個扒毳辯護）——你在甚麽時候失竊的。</p>
<p>失主——我不知道。只須問問你的當事人。因爲他把我的金時計也扒去了。</p>
<p>▲女主顧——你說這塊綢料是最時式的麽。</p>

<h3>菲律賓報界之托辣斯</h3>
<p>— 顏文初</p>
<p>菲島自歸美人領轄後。即報紙事業。亦蒸蒸日上。現在菲島各處有三種文字。可以通行。一英文。凡身受美國化敎育之學生靑年。皆目能觀口能讀。二西班牙文。因有三百餘年潛勢力。政府文吿。及上等社會聚會。能操西語者。猶爲岀色當行。三沓賈樂文。乃土文之一種。西人入菲時。用西班牙字母拼合土音而成。（另有一種文法。大槪一部份島著。肄業四個月。即能讀書看報。）因此有英文報。西文報。土文報。亦有一項報紙。兼印兩種文字者。</p>
<p>菲人Ｒooess爲西人混血種。席乃父富厚遺產。以個人資本經營三大日報。一·論　報。Ｔribune（英文報）二·以民意報。Ｖangurdia（西文報）三·Taliba土文報。三報每日印刷有十五萬份。論壇報另發行星期增刋。可多消售五萬份。尚有二份星期報。每週印刷七萬餘份。其操縱輿論之力量。在全菲無與倫比。</p>
<p>論壇報聘請菲大敎授Ｒomulo氏。爲總主筆。月俸一千五百庇樹。（合現時華銀近二千一百元。）氏爲菲島有名雄辯家。去年有辯論團。往美國宣傳獨立。即由氏領導。故除大學敎授外。得兼司此要職。</p>
<p>凡含有西人血統之菲人。皆有排華性。Ｒocess亦不能例外。故彼所岀版各日報週刋。對華僑皆日肆排斥。移居民之日益嚴厲。皆由彼報鼓吹之結果也。（却酬）</p>
<h3>畫象趣談</h3>
<p>— 持佛</p>
<p>頃於友人家中。談及某君畫家象趣事。錄之以供一噱。某君者。紈袴子也。嘗倩某畫師寫小影。以配景難於着筆。構思不得。初擬漱石枕流。作棲隠岩谷狀。自視縱屬高致。微嫌幽僻。繼乃易以手杖革履。若政海貴官也者。又覺舖張過華。未能免俗。躊躇久之。不得其旨。客有以春郊試馬圖進者。繪以依依垂柳。嫩緑搖曳。灼灼夭桃。綻紅吐萼。乃於此平原春草淺碧如茵間。繪其人馳馬揚鞭。雅合古人詩云。（春風得意馬蹄疾。一夕看遍長安花）句。景旣雅逸。意復豪華。見圖大悅。携以示友。並相贊賞。後有人笑曰。此大不佳直譏晒之耳。試思馬也。柳也。人也。合而言之。寗非（馬流人）乎。聞者爲之捧腹。蓋人品儇簿。謂之馬流人。俗語也。乃者富貴之人。營築莵裘。輒倩名流題額往往受譏訕而猶以爲榮。皆紈袴子之類歟。</p>
<h3>徐州瑣記</h3>
<p>— 羽白</p>
<p>徐州菜館生意很發達。因爲徐地是一個四通八達的地方。駐軍迭易。官場常時送往迎來。輒借菜館爲唯一的酬應塲。故一品香菜館主人。於近一二年來。已賺了四五萬。俱是倚仗着軍隊來去的應酬。</p>
<p>現時徐州駐軍很多。但市民已習苦慣常。毫無驚恐之象。以徐州人在這十年來。已司空見慣了。</p>
<p>徐州的雞蛋很便宜。一塊錢可買六十個。</p>
<p>徐州的點心。很做得好。尤其岀名的是山查糕。甜得異常。價錢也不貴。</p>
<p>徐州的猪油。每元可購三斤十二兩。南京每元購二斤六兩。但蚌埠更便宜。每元可購四斤。</p>
<p>徐州銅元每元換四百五十枚。但祇有雙枚銅元。而實際上雙枚銅元佔極少數。街市上用的都是當五十文的。以及一百枚五十枚的銅元票。幣制之紊亂可謂達於極點。此外天津鈔票濟南鈔票上海鈔票一致通用。</p>
<p>上次中央銀行封關之際。徐州錢商曾乘機賺錢不少。蓋因當時交通斷絶。中央上海鈔不能兌現。錢商以六七折收買。由海道至滬轉兌。一轉移間獲利數萬元。</p>
<h3>送子趣聞</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>子嗣觀念。中於我國人甚深。縱現定法律。女子亦有承產之權。但重男心理。尚未能革。因之不育之輩。其渴思得子。幾如大旱之望雲霓。人力不及。則岀諸祈禱。迷信之舉。有足使人捧腹者。爰舉我見。以供談助。</p>
<p>▲送子臨門　下關升安里。距余居不數武。有某家主人。供職某機關。如齊人之一妻一妾。惟年事四旬餘。迄未生育。平日每以無後爲憾。形諸亂色。友之悉其底藴者。乃爲其代禱於某廟。祈畢提燈引導。而用鼓樂隨其後。抵門鞭砲劈拍。樂聲之中。復雜彩語。喧　非凡。於是觀者大集。而警察亦來。</p>
<p>▲警察干涉　燃放爆竹。有干禁例。而迷信舉動。更爲現時所不容有。故警察一聞竹聲。即趨來詰問究竟。責其何以事前並不報吿。卒由該家主人。婉解道歉。警始引去。</p>
<p>▲閙房掛燈　送子進門之後。復升堂登樓。相將入主人寢室。鏡鈸齊鳴。祝辭連篇。並舉携來紙燈。懸諸床頭。預卜夢熊之兆。同時衆口道賀。而主人亦面現笑容。稱謝不已。</p>
<p>▲隣人口談　此一幕趣劇。發生於本月一日。當時余詢儲隣人。據談求子送子。此地所恒有。禱者每多靈騐。城内有三爲娘娘廟。尤富異跡。故遠道來求者頗衆。且舉某家禱而得子。其家一索即雄。以實其說。不經之言。付諸一笑可耳。</p>
<h3>猜字奇術</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>成佛成仙。本爲虛無縹渺之談。處茲科學昌明時期。尤爲達者所不齒。顧事之確鑿而情節怪異者。報章亦時見刋載。自未能盡以荒誕目之。客有兪姓者。越王台畔人。自幼聰頴過人。弱冠後習靜好佛。値庚申之夕。必盤膝趺坐。如老僧之入定然。（按俗有盤膝端坐六十庚申之夕。能成地仙云云。然乎否乎。當質諸佛學家矣。）據云能見人所不見之事物。然人輒不之深信。一夕宴會。客亦蒞止。好事者耳其名。爭丐其一試法術。以佐酒興。客微晒曰。有何法術可言。無已。請作猜字之游戲可乎。衆報可。客曰。君等以素箋就另室書字。筆畫繁簡。悉任自便。書畢。將紙揉團投予口中。予當以原字報之耳。於是均各默書字句。次第投入客之口内。客咀嚼下咽。依次另紙錄岀。或爲一字。或爲一句。屢試不差分毫。衆爲驚奇不置。客並述嘗旅行遠道。中途忽缺糧。竟三日不進飲食。旋復連餐梅實數十。不以爲苦。噫嘻。如斯客者。固有别於常人矣。</p>

<h3>雅歌春季彩排記</h3>
<p>— 老拙</p>
<p>雅歌票社自去歲改組委員會後。内部大加整理。適逢廿周年紀念。同人益復瘁心於此盛大之紀念。多方籌備。先是廣徵名人宏著。輯爲特刋。繼复參考脚本。昕夕排練身段。以爭一日之長。並徵求會員。襄斯盛會。風聲所揚。入會者踵相接。故昨冬紀念彩排三日。成績昭昭在人耳目。惟新會員多有臨時加入。未及籌備登臺者。特於本月一日晚。假座寗波同鄕會。補行春季彩排。共演劇十齣。泰半初次臨塲。雖未足語如何之成績。而朝氣方濃。靡不興奮從事。新會員中有唱旦角者。曹亮節君。扮相嗓音俱佳。學雖未幾時。已漸露頭角。洵票界中之優秀份子也。又新會員鶯韻女士。去歲甫從陳君彥衡研究劇事。是晚初次岀演玉堂春。鶯聲嚦嚦。發爲妙韻。陳爲操琴。更善襯托。柳靑娘一段牌子。與（　兒買我七歲正）之胡琴過門。宛轉如畫眉之嬌啼琤琤作聲。信非凡所能。王君得天洪君雁賓合演斷太后。王之黑凈。聲如霹靂。足以驚破觀客睡魔。（演此劇時已午夜。）洪之老旦。聲容動作。悉合戲情。洪君天籟特佳。倘益宏以學力。當更可觀。末劇逍遙津。張君運濟飾漢獻帝。做工老到。唱亦平穏。朱君聯馥飾穆顺。吳君老圃飾曹操。操於午門盤詰穆顺時。兩人對口。甚見精采。亦非一日之功也。是晚來賓持有人塲券者。可憑券摸彩。並各贈紀念特刋一册。以是觀者倍形擁擠。劇罷已鐘鳴二下。歸而濡筆記之如此。</p>
<h3>心上温馨（一四二）</h3>

<p>▲釐拆價格　（洋釐）早市釐價爲七錢二分○半釐、與前午相同、午市又弱一毫二忽半、爲七錢二分○三毫七忽半、結果較前日早市共降二毫半、（銀拆）轉賑及銀拆、早午兩市又復白借、劃頭昨亦無加水行市、</p>

<h3>美農局救濟棉花經過</h3>
<p>▲過去計畫殊鮮成效可言</p>
<p>▲减少棉田農民已認必要</p>
<p>紐約訊、美棉市價自去年夏季以來、繼續下趨、現已降至一九二六－二七年大豐收以來之最低價値、聯邦農務局之權威、至此乃成問題矣、聯邦農務局爲去春胡佛就任總統時所設立之農業救濟機關、其設立之主要目的、爲奬勵並援助農產合作銷售、藉謀市價之安定、以此有備五百萬元之資金、以資周轉、棉價在去秋尚保持其相當價格、無救濟必要、嗣以棉農之急於岀售、市價遂開始跌落、農務局乃發表每磅一角六分爲救濟之標準、故棉價雖處於證券恐慌時期、仍能維持在一角七分以上、又農務局爲謀各州合作社之聯絡計、乃組織全國棉花合作銷售社以每年有十萬包以上交易之合作社爲股東、於一月十五日成立、其資本爲三千萬元、該社握有股東之棉花棉籽販賣之全權、並從本年新棉上市起、營業不僅於現貨、併有處理期貨之權、且有在世界各棉花中心市楊設分社之計劃、該社雖屬棉農所經營、然農務局有借欵之關係、須服從農務局之意旨、而該局之棉花政策、即由此聯合機關所推行、因此該社之營業方針、頗引起人所重視、乃該社於一月末發表該社（並不策劃大量的買進、及以法外之高値買進）之後、市價遂俄然崩落、竟跌至農務局借欵標準之下、此由於棉農對於該社發生疑慮年致、以是市價狂落、於是倣小麥之故智、由各州合作社推舉委員組織棉花顧問委員會、而擬設立鞏固棉花公司、該公司之作用、即向市塲收買過剩之棉花、以穏定棉市、所有損失則由農務局貼補、此事現尚未正式成立、農務局一方謀合作社之聯絡、同時勸吿農民减少棉田、並正式發起减少棉田六百萬畝（即比去年減少百分之一·二五）之運動、然其力殊鮮、蓋以大部份之棉作者猶居於有利之地位也、迨二月棉市又復急落、農民痛感棉田有减少之必要、减少棉田之運動近復緊張、雖不能减少如農務局所擬之百分之一·二五之程度、或亦可見相當數字之减少也云、</p>
<h3>糧食遠月麥交暢市振</h3>
<p>▲江北產區雷雨極大···有碍麥收</p>
<p>昨期麥上下午開盤後、本月份因買賣意未接近、全日未開、四月份雖有做開、亦形寂寞、惟遠期新麥、則交易甚暢、市勢亦頗興奮、考其原因、實以江北各產區、雷雨甚盛俗以未到驚蟄、有此情形、恐將來麥收、未能大熟故人心陡堅、買户轉暢也、結果四月份較前日奸一分六月份好三分、七月份好一分、八月份未動、現麥市面、以標準轉穏、廠胃頗佳高擋貨又喊高一二分不等、中次仍平、開清江麥五兩一錢半、五兩一錢七分、宿州麥五兩一錢七分、安慶麥五兩一錢五兩零五分、次至四兩九錢三分、江西麥四兩九錢三分、四兩八錢二分、四兩八錢、沙市麥四兩九錢七分、湖南麥四兩九錢、共開三千三百五十包、由福新阜豐辦去云、</p>
<h3>春寒提高新粉市値</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上下午開盤後、近期各月份大致漲落互見、遠期則頗堅定、本月份初以洋麥報價好四五角不等、（惟芝加哥五月份跌五角左右）故初盤開價、即到二兩五錢五分二釐半、惟以後即步軟、因政局未人安寗之境、北銷難望其活躍、後步之不振、即係此故、四五月份、人心尚定、大致盤旋、至六七八月份之新粉市况、市氣反見良好、因春令太寒、雨水必多、兼爲新陳粉之銜接起見、大有近平遠堅之趨勢、故將來至必要時、恐遠期尚有續高之機會也、結果本月份不動、四月份較前日好二釐半、五月份不動、六月份好七釐半、七月份好一分、八月好五釐云、</p>

<h3>The Three Yuanzhangs Admonish Yan Xishan Again</h3>
<p>Hoping He Would Demonstrate Obedience to the Central Government With Facts</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The three Yuanzhangs, Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, and Wang Chonghui, telegraphed Yan Xishan again today, urging him to isolate corrupt elements and cease inauspicious actions, so that the true situation could be clarified and people's hearts could be calmed. The original telegram is as follows:</p>
<p>To Vice Commander Yan Baichuan, Taiyuan,</p>
<p>Having read your reply, we are pleased to know that our humble sentiments have been fully conveyed, and that you have turned your mind around and no longer insist on your previous proposal. Jie Gong (Chiang Kai-shek) received the Prime Minister's recognition and the Party and the country's important trust. His decision to stay or leave should not be influenced by your words alone. Since you have indicated this, we are comforted. We have also seen your telegram to the Central Executive Committee, which is concise and meaningful, clearly stating that you will no longer make the proposals of your previous telegram, which is fortunate. We are further mindful that all the corrupt elements abandoned by our Party are now gathering around you, wanting to use you as a sacrifice. Their words are sweet, their demeanor respectful, and their tactics of encirclement and instigation are highly skilled. Seeing your hesitation, they will exert all their intelligence to mislead you. We are deeply concerned about your difficult situation and dare to frankly express our thoughts again. We hope you will carefully consider them. Since our telegram was sent, we have received your replies many times, but unfavorable news has also arrived successively, such as the entry of Feng Pengju's division into western Shandong, the disruption of Jinpu Railway traffic, the seizure of telecommunications facilities, the alteration of incoming and outgoing telegrams, the surveillance of Party headquarters, the arrest of Party members, and even the establishment of separate banners and private titles, mobilizing to move south and exposing their intentions. All these news items in the newspapers are by no means fabricated. As a result, the whole country is indignant and has reported to the Central Government, willing to be the vanguard and request to launch a punitive expedition. For the sake of the people of several provinces and for your future, the Central Government has strongly advocated peace and has not prepared for war, seeking complete solutions through various means. This is not only known to the people of the whole country, but should also be deeply understood by your colleagues, Ci Long, Jie San, and the other two brothers. The ancients said, "Governing does not require many words, and stopping slander is best done through self-cultivation." If you can appreciate this, you should revoke the title of the "Military of the Republic of China," withdraw the commissions of all commanders-in-chief and commanders, release the Jinpu Railway trains, withdraw the Jin troops from western Shandong, and restore the freedom of the Party headquarters under surveillance and the arrested Party members, and ensure that all Party affairs, political and military measures are taken in accordance with the orders of the Central Government without any deviation. Only then can the true situation be clarified, people's hearts calmed, the laws and regulations of the Party and the country restored, and your merits immeasurable. We are also mindful that you may already be constrained by the environment you have created. From the Communist Party to the Anfu Clique, they are attracting and attaching themselves to you, crowding your guesthouses. Who is responsible for this? Who is under your command? The cause and effect of this situation seem complicated. We have personally witnessed and participated in political changes and know these people well. They are like a snake that bites your arm. If you do not endure the pain and cut off your arm, the poison will inevitably spread throughout your body. They have no power to rebel, but want to use your power to disrupt the Party and the country. They have no sense of right and wrong, but want to use your words to confuse right and wrong. They come only to use you as a puppet, not out of love. Their defeat will only be your sacrifice, which they will not regret. If you do not see through their schemes, either drive them out or arrest them and hand them over to the authorities, then the harm you will suffer will be endless. Eventually, like mosquitoes forming thunder, and wrongdoing becoming commonplace, you will be trapped in a dead end, and will not be tolerated by the people. For example, you accepted the warning from the Central Government and knew that as a Party member you must obey, but you still said that previous warlords and rebels all rose up because of Party struggles, the facts are there, how can you deny it? It is clear that you are deeply poisoned by the seditious words of those who seek to harm the government. In summary, all of the above comes from sincerity, hoping that you will prove your obedience to the Central Government with facts and expel the rebels of the Party and the country with determination. Only then will the voices of the people cease and the great waves subside. Tying and untying the bell lies with you. We hope you will carefully consider and plan well.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The World Unemployment Problem</h3>
<p>The unemployment problem has now become the most important problem in the world. There is no need to discuss the poor and weak nations. Even the richest and most powerful countries, such as the United States, Britain, Japan, and Germany, which are the most developed in industry and the most abundant in capital, are unable to solve this unemployment problem. How much more so is this true for other countries?</p>
<p>According to the US government's method of alleviating unemployment, funds are allocated for construction to provide employment for unemployed workers. It is deeply understood that the large number of unemployed workers is mostly due to an oversupply of goods. The strength of the world's sales market is weakening day by day. If the unemployed are employed in factories, the more that is produced, the more the supply of goods will exceed demand, making sales even more difficult and inevitably increasing the number of unemployed due to factory failures. Therefore, using these funds for construction, which is not intended to produce goods, will certainly not increase unemployment among other workers. The recent issue of the high price of gold is also a manifestation of the oversupply of goods, which leads to lower prices.</p>
<p>In essence, the world's unemployment problem is actually the world's problem of too many goods. Therefore, to solve the unemployment problem, the problem of too many goods must be solved first. It is easy to make money but lacks influence. People from mountain villages are tending towards cities and towns, which is why goods are increasing and purchasing power is weakening, leading to the phenomenon of increasing unemployment. From now on, if relief efforts are to be implemented, they must inevitably move towards the path of developing land resources.</p>

<h3>The Atmosphere of Revival at the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>The General Representatives of Various Countries Meet Once</p>
<p>The First Committee is Scheduled to Meet on the 6th</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, London, 4th. The Disarmament Plenipotentiary Conference opened today. British MacDonald, Japanese --- Waka, Italian Grandi, French Fulerio, American Deputy Gibson, and others attended as plenipotentiaries. Some agreements were made. Also, U.S. Stimson is suffering from severe symptoms and needs several days of rest, so Gibson will serve as acting chairman and attend various meetings.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, London, 4th. The Chairman's Meeting was held at St. James's Palace at 11:00 AM today. Because France has not yet sent a formal plenipotentiary, it was impossible to proceed with deliberations, so the following two items were announced. The meeting adjourned after a discussion. (1) The British, American, and Japanese plenipotentiaries, along with French representative Fulerio, are scheduled to meet at St. James's Palace at 10:00 AM on the 5th. (2) The First Committee will meet at 10:00 AM on the 6th to review the reports of the specialized committees. The Chairman's Meeting will be held on the 7th.</p>

<h3>The Formation of a New Unity Among British Political Parties</h3>
<p>Baldwin Speaks at the Central Council</p>
<p>The Conservative Party Expresses Approval</p>
<p>The Liberal Party Resolves Differences Resulting in the Passage of a Vote of Confidence in the Party Leader</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th. The Central Council of the National Association of the Conservative and Unionist Parties has always held meetings where outsiders are not allowed to listen. Now, because the current political situation is different from the past, news reporters were specially allowed to enter the venue for today's Central Council meeting. Baldwin addressed the audience, saying that all the trust that existed a year ago has now been extinguished. The financial situation is becoming increasingly serious. With trust lost, unemployment has greatly increased. When the Conservative Party regains power in the future, it will definitely use national financial resources sparingly and encourage industries. This can be successful with a thorough guarantee policy. A guarantee policy is more reliable and effective than a widespread protection policy. We must combine imperial policies with domestic policies. Unless the British people are sure of the relationship between food taxes and what they can gain in return, they will ultimately not be willing to have the British people vote on the issue of food taxes. The first thing the Conservative Party should do after regaining power is to convene an imperial conference to seek achievements. If the discussion results in a method that is very beneficial to the British people and requires the levying of foreign food taxes, then this entire issue can be clearly handed over to the people, he said.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th. The opinions of various newspapers differ on the speech made by Conservative Party leader Baldwin today at the Central Council of the Conservative and Unionist Associations. The evening papers say that Baldwin has adopted the policies of the Imperial Unionist Party, while the Star newspaper says that the Conservative Party leader ignores the new party. However, the founders of the Imperial Unionist Party all accept Baldwin's policies. Sir Beaverbrook even published an article stating that Baldwin's speech has fully and perfectly acknowledged the purpose of the imperial movement. This movement can prevent the Conservative Party from encountering opposition in its constituencies. However, the Imperial Unionist Party must work harder to awaken the people of the country and the empire to support the policy of free trade within the empire, he said.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th. During the Conservative Party Central Council meeting, a motion was put forward advocating immediate continuation of the movement to stipulate tax rates, protect British industry, commerce, agriculture, and domestic workers, and take imperial free trade as its ultimate goal, which caused considerable discussion. The original motion was finally amended, deleting the word "agriculture," and then a motion was unanimously passed advocating that the expansion of the industrial protection plan be one of the main platforms of the Conservative Party in the next election.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 4th. Liberal Party members of Parliament met in the House of Commons today for an hour to seek a resolution of differences within the party. Therefore, when the meeting adjourned, everyone had a pleasant expression. Attendees passed a vote of confidence in party leader George and guidance director Hukisheng. Each member stated that they were willing to cooperate wholeheartedly for the welfare of the Liberal Party.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Government Discusses Solutions to Unemployment</h3>
<p>Davis Advocates...</p>
<p>Allocating Special Funds for Construction</p>
<p>The Communist Party Declares...</p>
<p>Organizing Unemployment Demonstrations</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Washington, 4th. After the U.S. government was greatly attacked by Congress yesterday regarding the unemployment issue, President Hoover specially invited all cabinet members today to discuss solutions to unemployment. Labor Secretary Davis advocated that the government allocate 50 million yuan in special funds for construction to help unemployed laborers. According to Davis's idea, this method is much better than the proposal put forward by Senator Borah to allocate funds for direct relief. Borah's proposal would provide each unemployed worker with a stipend of 18 yuan per week. Davis said that this kind of proposal is deeply disliked by all sectors of society, and what American laborers want is to earn their living through labor. Sitting and waiting to be fed is probably not what they want.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Washington, 4th. U.S. Labor Secretary Davis, on behalf of President Hoover, responded to Congress's criticism of the government as being numb regarding the unemployment issue today. According to Davis, there are currently 3 million unemployed people, but the main reason for this situation is the repeated delays in the tariff bill.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New York, 4th. The Communist Party has declared that it intends to organize multiple unemployment demonstrations starting tomorrow and plans to hold a conference in Chicago to discuss long-term institutional problems. New York Police Commissioner Huland has ordered the police to implement a policy of (allowing free speech but not allowing riots). Russian Socialist Abramovich said that the demonstrations in the United States and elsewhere in the world were planned by Stalin in order to revive the declining prestige of communism outside Russia.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minsei Party Discusses Relief for Market Panic</h3>
<p>The House of Peers Begins Investigating the Truth</p>
<p>The Interior Minister Cracks Down on Disturbances in the Financial World</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. Yesterday, the General Affairs Committee of the Minsei Party discussed the current declines in the stock market, raw silk, and other markets. They believe that the stock market decline is due to the outflow of cash, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are due to India raising tariffs, and raw silk is due to the fatigue of the New York market. They believe that it is necessary to discuss appropriate relief measures for these various reasons. Regarding Indian tariffs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must be asked to urge the Indian government to reconsider. Regarding the sharp decline in raw silk prices, the Ministry of Finance must be asked to quickly implement the Silk Price Financing Guarantee Law. The arrangements have been made. Kato Masanosuke, Masuda Yoshiichi, and Den Sozo immediately went to the Ministry of Finance to meet with Finance Minister Inoue. The Finance Minister said that the financial situation is bad because of the backlash from the lifting of the gold embargo. This was expected. However, there is no need to be pessimistic about the future. Trade imports will continue to exceed exports, and gold outflows will be unavoidable. However, this is not something to be afraid of. As a rule, the second half of the year is a period of export surplus, and gold will inevitably flow in again. Last year, due to the short time since the cabinet was formed, the full effect was not achieved. However, there has been a significant reduction in imports. This year, thoroughly implementing consumption savings and promoting domestic products, the reduction in imports will certainly be even more impressive. Although there are various kinds of bad propaganda about the stock market decline, setting aside external reasons for the time being, there is no material to speak of within the country. In short, there is no need to be pessimistic about the future. Therefore, the government has not considered relief measures at this time. Regarding silk price stability, I believe that the active measures proposed by the Minister of Agriculture are very appropriate. I myself have expressed my support for it.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. Recently, due to the financial situation and the sharp decline in stocks, signs of turmoil in the financial world have become apparent. Various aspects of the House of Peers are deeply concerned and have begun investigating to explore the truth. They intend to warn the government soon to expedite the countermeasures after the lifting of the gold embargo.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. Interior Minister Adachi, because there have recently been those who plot to disrupt the financial world, telegraphed the authorities in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places yesterday, ordering them to severely crack down.</p>
<h3>Student Unrest Occurs in the Philippines</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Thousand High School Students Go on Strike</p>
<p>Protesting the Education Director's Expulsion of Students</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Manila, 4th. A student strike occurred here today, with 14,000 high school students going on strike. The incident was caused by a certain American female teacher who offended Filipinos in her words. The students initially demanded the dismissal of the teacher, and now they are demanding that the four expelled students be allowed to return to school. The police today mobilized all reserves to suppress the riots. Several students were seriously injured, and another student was stabbed. A girl was stripped and trampled on by a mob in the open space of the North High School. A police officer tried to save her and was beaten by the crowd.</p>
<p>▲ Guomin News Agency, Manila, 5th. Ten thousand students from four high schools here have unanimously refused to attend classes to protest the Education Director Bailey's expulsion of four students from the Northern High School, accusing them of inciting the strike two weeks ago. Initially, a female English teacher, Miss Bai Luomituo, made anti-Philippine remarks during class. At that time, all the fourth-year students unanimously withdrew to express their protest. The strike then brewed. The students demanded that they would not resume classes unless the teacher was dismissed. Subsequently, the Education Director announced that Bai had been replaced and instructed the students to resume classes quickly and dismissed the four students who led the strike. The students then said that this strike was entirely motivated by patriotism and that the students should not be held responsible. They demanded that the Education Director revoke his dismissal order. The Director refused, so there was a second strike. At present, the two sides are deadlocked. There was a slight disturbance yesterday. Four students were charged with assaulting a police officer and were arrested. All high schools have police protection to prevent striking students from attacking resuming students. Today is still peaceful.</p>

The Textile Union Japanese-Indian Association and the Economic Alliance Cotton Cloth Traders Association held a meeting yesterday and resolved to oppose India's increase in cotton cloth tariffs. They said that this move violates the principle of international coordination, and the implementation of this preferential tariff will cause the world's powers to return to the exclusive plan of the past, which is a great threat to world peace and should be withdrawn immediately. At the same time, Party members Takeuchi Sakuhei, Ichihyakubo Tsugiro, and Maeda Fusanosuke visited Foreign Minister Shidehara yesterday and strongly protested against India's increase in cotton cloth tariffs. The Foreign Minister said that the Indian cotton cloth tariff is currently under investigation and research, and he will definitely work hard to live up to everyone's expectations.</p>

The tax rate, which was originally 4 rupees per 112 pounds, has been changed to 6 rupees. The most affected will be Javanese sugar. Although sugar is different from cotton cloth, there is no difference in preferential tariffs. However, the exports of Javanese sugar will inevitably be hit, and they will inevitably seek sales routes in the Far East.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>The Fourth General Assembly of the Third Plenary Session was held on the morning of the 5th. The resolutions are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Public Training Program During the Tutelage Period</p>
<p>The Third National Congress of our party, in order to remedy the shortcomings of past mass movements, resolved to adopt the following four principles as the overall guiding principles for future mass movements: (1) Mass movements must start from the needs of the people for survival in society and create them as an organized people. (2) The national farmers and workers who already have considerable organizations must be assisted by our party to increase their knowledge and skills, raise their standards of social morality, promote their productivity and production volume, and achieve the goal of improving the people's livelihood. (3) Agricultural economy occupies the main part of China's national economy. Future mass movements must support rural education, rural organizations, cooperative movements, and instill new agricultural productivity methods as the main tasks. (4) Our party should do its best to create an autonomous life within schools for young men and women, implement general physical training for young men and women, promote scientific and literary gatherings, associations, publications, and encourage practical scientific research and inventions, in order to realize the above-mentioned guidelines and complete the work of political tutelage. Therefore, a public training program is formulated, divided into four sections: 1. Basic principles of public training; 2. Organization; 3. Training; 4. The powers and responsibilities of party departments and the government towards people's organizations. It is believed that in the period of political tutelage, in order to apply the mass movement guidelines resolved by the Third National Congress, there are also theoretical issues that should be determined first. Therefore, the first section stipulates the spirit of people's organization and the key points to be noted in training. Secondly, training the people must enable them to have sound organizations, and then the training work can be carried out effectively. Therefore, the second section stipulates how party departments at all levels should guide the organization of people's organizations. As for the scope of training, and the methods and means of training, they are stipulated in the third section. Furthermore, considering that in the past, the responsibilities of party departments and the government at all levels towards people's organizations were unclear, which caused obstacles to the progress of mass movement work, the fourth section provides concrete regulations on the powers and responsibilities of party departments and the government towards people's organizations. This program is based on the needs of the political tutelage period as a matter of principle. As for how to implement it, it should be submitted to the Central Standing Committee to formulate detailed methods based on this program for implementation. (Section 1) Basic principles of public training: (1) The organization of people's organizations should be based on the principle of automatic organization; (2) Training the people must recognize the needs of the people for survival in society and the spirit of the party's political tutelage. (Section 2) Organization: (1) Party departments should guide various people's organizations to become sound organizations; (2) Party departments should guide various people to complete their organizations. (Section 3) Training, First item, scope of training: (1) General training: A. Organizational training, so that the people understand the meaning and methods of organization; B. Ideological training, so that the people have a deep understanding and belief in the party's ideology, understand the errors of the Communist Party's advocacy of class struggle, and thoroughly understand the mass movement guidelines during the political tutelage period; C. Behavioral training, so that the people's actions conform to the party's ideology and practice the construction work of the Three Principles of the People. (2) Special training: A. Vocational knowledge training, so that the people enrich their vocational knowledge and understand their tasks to the country and society; B. Vocational skill training, so that the people increase their vocational skills and promote the development of construction undertakings. Second item, training methods: (1) Group-based: divide the members of each organization into groups to facilitate the implementation of training; (2) Meeting-based: general meetings of members of each organization, mass rallies, holding Sun Yat-sen Commemoration Weeks, etc.; (3) School-based: establishing civilian schools, special vocational training schools, etc.; (4) Social-based: establishing popular libraries, amateur clubs, various experimental fields, etc. (Section 4) The powers and responsibilities of party departments and the government towards people's organizations: (1) People's organizations are subject to the guidance of party departments and the supervision of the government; (2) When a party department imposes sanctions on a people's organization without guidance, it must submit it to the superior party department for approval before issuing the order, but the dissolution of the people's organization must also be transferred to the local government for execution according to law; (3) If the government believes that a people's organization must be dissolved, it must handle it according to law, but it must notify the local party department before execution. Proponents: Dai Chuanxian, He Yingqin.</p>
<p>▲Preliminary plan prepared by the Preparatory Office of the Eastern and Northern Great Ports, please review and approve it and determine the method of raising funds. The reasons why the Northern Great Port and the Eastern Great Port must be built are stated in Sun Yat-sen's "The International Development of China." This committee, in accordance with his last instructions, successively established the preparatory offices of the two great ports of the East and the North to carry out planning and surveying for half a year. However, funds and instruments are lacking, and the work is extremely difficult. In recent months, the depth of the waters near the harbor site have been surveyed one after another, and the preparatory office has prepared a preliminary plan, which was approved by the committee's member congress in February of this year and submitted to the government for review and approval. As for the fundraising methods, the plan lists four items: (1) Please include it in the government budget; (2) Raise public bonds; (3) Borrow foreign debts; (4) The above three methods are used simultaneously. According to the current situation of second- and third-class seaports such as Huludao and Wusong, although they are under construction successively, the world-class ports advocated by Sun Yat-sen must be established sooner or later, and their detailed surveying and planning must begin several years before construction starts. How should the fundraising method be determined so that the work of the two great ports can proceed in an orderly manner? I would like to submit it to the government for a public decision. Proposers: Zhang Renjie, Ye Chucang, Li Yuying, Wu Jingheng. (According to the resolution of this case, it will be submitted to the National Government for review and handling.)</p>
<p>▲The issue of political training for the army should be handled by the special party department of the army.</p>
<p>The implementation of political training in the army is the main task of the special party department. However, the old system re-established the political training office to take charge of it. According to experience, the powers and responsibilities of all parties are difficult to divide, and the work is also redundant. For the sake of the present, it is advisable to seek a merger as soon as possible in order to unify the powers and responsibilities. Several methods are drafted below. Is it appropriate? Please wait for a public decision. (1) Except for the Political Training Department of the Directorate General of Training, the political training offices at all levels shall be abolished. The affairs concerning the political training of soldiers shall be handled by the special party departments of the army at all levels. (2) All special party departments of the army shall be appointed by the central government as special commissioners who have passed training and examination to guide and supervise the implementation of political training in the army on the spot. (3) For armies that have not established special party departments, the central government shall send additional special commissioners to prepare for the organization of special party departments and take on the task of political training. (4) The special commissioners mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be trained by the political training class specially established by the Political Training Department of the Directorate General of Training. (5) If there are junior officers in the army who have not received political training, they shall be transferred to the central party department in turn by the Political Training Department of the Directorate General of Training for training in stages. Proposer: Standing Committee of the Central Committee.</p>
<h3>Henan Relief Association Asks for Protection of Refugees</h3>
<p>▲And report the disaster situation in Baofeng and Neixiang counties</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Henan Provincial Relief Association sent telegrams to military and political authorities in various provinces, asking them to protect the refugees who went to various provinces to find food. The telegram reads as follows: (Henan Province has suffered from disasters for years, and wars have been frequent, resulting in villages with cut off smoke and households with little grain. There have been many deaths, and people and animals have eaten each other. Thousands of refugees along the Longhai Road seek food every day. Luoyang and Zheng Bian have set up shelters, but the funds are exhausted and cannot accommodate all the refugees. The disaster victims have no choice but to flee to nearby provinces in order to survive. We have always admired your kindness and willingness to help. We hope that you will order your subordinates to provide food and release all disaster victims who hold passports from our association, or properly resettle them locally, so that the poor and exhausted can save their lives. We are grateful for your great kindness. Zhang Fang, Henan Provincial Relief Association, respectfully)</p>
<p>The Henan Relief Association also telegraphed the National Government Chairman Chiang, Executive Yuan President Tan, Minister of Finance Song, Minister of Interior Yang, Chairman of the Relief Committee Xu, and the governments of various provinces to report the disaster situation in Baofeng and Neixiang counties. The contents are recorded as follows: (1) According to the telegrams from the Baofeng County Government and various agencies, the losses caused by the war in the county are summarized as follows: (1) 1,042 deaths; (2) Houses burned down, valued at over 233,400 yuan; (3) Loss of livestock and vehicles, valued at over 89,500 yuan; (4) Looted property, valued at over 3.2 million yuan; (5) 178,000 yuan in levies; (6) 23,000 yuan in grass and fodder; (7) Over 3 million catties of grain seized, valued at over 400,000 yuan. At present, defeated soldiers and bandits are everywhere, and the number of displaced and dead is increasing day by day. The county has been ravaged by the repeated movements of the military, and no village has been spared. We urge you to provide relief quickly, so that the survivors after the robbery can survive. The telegram is urgent, and we await your instructions. (2) According to the report from Wang Dezhao, the county magistrate of Neixiang, and various agencies, the county has suffered the most from the war. The summarized losses are roughly as follows: (1) Property looted, valued at over 585,300 yuan; (2) 276,500 yuan in grain and fodder supplied; (3) 86,000 yuan in levies; (4) 53,300 yuan in military uniforms; (5) 38,000 yuan in extortion of departure fees. Other losses, such as the death of livestock, the death or injury of laborers, and the death of villagers due to bullets, are even more difficult to calculate. As a result, families are displaced, and clothing and food are exhausted. They are sleeping in the open and waiting for starvation. There is weeping in the villages and emaciated figures in the towns. Deaths continue one after another in the spring. If no relief is provided quickly, there will be no survivors. The county is located on the border and is a military strategic location between Qin and Yu, and the damage is very deep. We urge you to provide relief supplies and grain to save the remnants, and we are extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Customs Increases Taxes Twice</h3>
<p>▲The Xiamen People's Representative Assembly Denies It</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Xiamen Customs changed the valuation of domestically produced goods for export. The Chief Inspector of Customs in the capital sent a letter to the Xiamen Customs Supervisor, who forwarded it to the General Chamber of Commerce. It is estimated that a pound and a half of canned bamboo shoots will be estimated at 9.5 taels per hundred cans, the original estimate was 8 taels; two and a half pounds of bamboo shoots were originally estimated at 15 taels, and it is proposed to estimate 18 taels. Small cans of bamboo shoots were originally estimated at 4 taels and it is proposed to estimate 4.8 taels. Half a pound of beans were originally estimated at 4 taels and it is proposed to estimate 4.8 taels. Half a pound of melons were originally estimated at 4 taels and it is proposed to estimate 4.8 taels. Half a pound of , the original estimate was 4 taels, and it is proposed to estimate 4.8 taels. Cicada legs were originally estimated at 30 taels per hundred catties, and it is proposed to estimate 60 taels. Fresh bayberry was originally estimated at 2 taels and it is proposed to estimate 2.5 taels. Salted bayberry was originally estimated at 6 taels and it is proposed to estimate 8 taels. Dried bayberry was originally estimated at 5 taels and it is proposed to estimate 6 taels. Large double-petal daffodil bulbs were originally estimated at 45 taels per thousand grains, and it is proposed to estimate 50 taels. Medium-sized double-petal daffodil bulbs were originally estimated at 23 taels and it is proposed to estimate 30 taels. Small double-petal daffodil bulbs were originally estimated at 15 taels and it is proposed to estimate 20 taels. Meat floss was originally estimated at 75 taels per hundred catties, and it is proposed to estimate 80 taels. After receiving the letter, the General Chamber of Commerce convened a representative meeting of all businesses in Xiamen and resolved that the number of pure domestic goods exported from this port is small. It is regrettable that the government cannot subsidize tax reductions. The revaluation and increase of taxes hinders the export of domestic goods and conflicts with the government's proposed policy of advocating domestic goods. Therefore, it sent a letter to the Customs Supervisor, asking not to increase the valuation in order to maintain industry and commerce. In addition, the Customs resumed the import of foreign goods into the interior this year and increased the regular customs tax. The Chamber of Commerce opposed it and has not yet withdrawn it. The representative meeting of various merchants also resolved that imported goods have already paid the regular customs tax at the Customs, and if the regular customs tax is levied locally, if they are transported to Quanzhou Anhai Stone</p>
<p>Code and other hinterland, the regular customs tax must be levied again, which violates the principle of taxation. According to the Xiamen Regular Customs Regulations compiled and approved by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance in the ninth year of the Republic of China, it is recorded that the Xiamen Customs Supervisor Hu and the Tax Officer Xia jointly issued an announcement, which stated that goods imported from China and foreign countries by ships that have paid tax receipts and whose presentations are consistent are allowed to be transported to the interior for sale without paying taxes and fees for the example money order. Ships loaded with goods that have paid regular taxes and are re-exported are also allowed to be temporarily exempted from taxes and example money orders. There has been no change in the past years. The current tax officer's proposed change to the regular customs tax regulations is not appropriate. Please ask the General Chamber of Commerce to send a letter to the Customs Supervisor denying it and asking to maintain the original plan. However, the Customs has not yet expressed its opinion on the Chamber of Commerce's denial of the valuation increase and the restoration of regular taxes in the hinterland.</p>
<h3>Hunan Province divides the region for suppressing bandits</h3>
<p>▲The province is divided into twenty-two districts</p>
<p>Changsha Communication, February 27th. The suppression of bandits in Hunan Province has not been completed for several years. Recently, the communist bandits He Long and Zhou Chaowu are still entrenched in the Yongshun and Sangzhi areas of western Hunan, wantonly causing trouble. Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue still invade the Chaling and Youxian areas of eastern Hunan from time to time, engaging in massacres. The bandits in Pingxiang and Liuyang and other places are also active everywhere, and the bandits in Yangming Mountain have not yet been wiped out. In short, there are bandits in all seventy-six counties in Hunan. He Jian has now decided to earnestly reorganize the militia in each county, so that they can join forces with the defense army to suppress the bandits, hoping to wipe them out as soon as possible. It has been ascertained that there are more than 30,000 guns in the militia in Hunan Province. If they are given military training and join forces to suppress the bandits, they will be able to defend themselves. Therefore, the Hunan Provincial Qingxiang Headquarters was specially ordered to prepare a plan for reorganizing the militia and suppressing the bandits in order to review and handle it. The Qingxiang Headquarters has now detailed the regulations and divided the province into twenty-two districts. Each district is to be assigned a district commander, who is responsible for the reorganization, training, command, and suppression. All plans have been submitted to the provincial government for review and approval. Once approved, the district commanders will be announced and will begin their work. The reorganization plan and the division of regions are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>▲Reorganization Plan (1) Hunan Province's seventy-six counties are divided into twenty-two districts. (2) The areas previously designated should be considered by this headquarters based on the circumstances, and a number of districts should be established first. After the effectiveness is confirmed, it will be promoted again. (3) Each district is to be assigned a district commander. The organization of all district command headquarters staff and soldiers, as well as the salary schedule, will be determined separately. (4) Each district command headquarters may, if necessary in the counties under its jurisdiction, set up training officers to take responsibility for reorganization and training. (5) If the bandits in each district are slightly reduced, the district commander may transfer a team of regular troops from each county to be stationed at the district command headquarters for regular training and used in case of war. (6) All district commanders and their internal staff, as well as all training officers, shall be appointed by the Qingxiang Headquarters, selecting those who are knowledgeable, experienced, do not mind hard work, and are sincerely serving the people. (7) All salaries, public expenses, and temporary special expenses of the district command headquarters and training officers shall be paid by the province. (8) After the establishment of the district command headquarters, the titles of county magistrate兼联防指挥 formerly appointed shall be revoked.

<h3>Nanxun Road Majieling Station Burned Down by Bandits</h3>
<p>▲More than 40 employees were kidnapped</p>
<p>▲Passenger cars temporarily suspended for one day</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication, March 1st. Yongxiu and Dean, which are passed by the Nanxun Railway, have undulating ridges and dense forests. Small groups of communist bandits are erratic and difficult to defend. In January last year, Jianchang Station was burned down by communist bandits once, killing many workers. In December, there were hundreds of communist bandits in Majieling who opened fire on the train, hoping to rob the train. Fortunately, there were soldiers protecting the train, so it was spared from accidents. Since then, the authorities have paid special attention to the Nanxun Road. In addition to forming a road protection team, the troops stationed along the road also took care of the escort. At the end of last month, the engineer battalion of the 18th Division, which was originally stationed on the road, went to Ruichang to fill the defense because Yu Tuan in Ruichang went to Xiajiang to suppress bandits. The defense of Xun Road was slightly empty. The communist bandits took advantage of this opportunity to burn down the station. According to a telephone report from the Railway Bureau in Jiujiang, at 5:00 am on the first day of this month, hundreds of communist bandits with dozens of guns swarmed to Majieling Station, surrounded the station, and fired a volley of shots as a warning. The staff and workers in the station and the road protection team were awakened from their dreams and were at a loss. After the bandits entered the station, they first confiscated about 30 guns from the road protection team, then tied up the station master and the staff and workers, and searched all the property in the station. After the search, they fired several shots and set fire to the house. After the fire broke out, the bandits abducted more than 40 employees who were tied up and fled into the mountains. At 9:00 am, the first express train from Xun to the province arrived at Huanglaomen and turned back. The provincial express train to Tujiapu also turned back, because Majieling Station was not only burned to the ground, but also had dozens of feet of rails dug up and could not be used for traffic. After the incident, in addition to sending people to the station to clean up the ruins and repair the rails, the Railway Bureau also telegraphed Chairman Lu, Division Commander Zhang, and Brigade Commander Deng, asking them to send troops to suppress the bandits. It is reported that Lu has ordered Deputy Brigade Commander Hong stationed in Jiujiang and two regiments of Deng Brigade to quickly suppress the bandits, and the 18th Division has also sent additional troops to escort the trains to deter them.</p>
<p>Another message, this afternoon, the bandits have released the employees who were kidnapped, but the road protection team that was disarmed is still imprisoned by the bandits. Today, except for the Xun train to Shahe turning back, the provincial train did not run. The passenger car on the 2nd may run as usual.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Immigration Transportation Measures</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Department of Civil Affairs is actively carrying out the work of immigrating to the Northeast to develop wasteland. Yesterday, it formulated ten transportation measures and ordered the mayors of all cities and counties to be informed. The original order stated, (It has been checked that the immigration to the Northeast to develop wasteland was dispatched to all districts on January 1st to quickly supervise the village committees, inform the local residents, and widely publicize.

Now that this department has formulated the gathering and transportation measures, and has designated Shanghai as the general gathering place, and Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuxing, Ningbo, Haimen, Yongjia and other six places as the sub-gathering places, so as to facilitate the gathering and transfer nearby. All cities and counties should follow the order to report the number of reclamation households to the province as scheduled, and at the same time, inform the municipal and county governments of the designated gathering place by letter at any time to make proper contacts, and take care of the gathering according to the dates specified in another order once or in batches and wait for the transfer.

Five to ten groups are a collective, with a collective leader, deputy secretary, and several servants. The collective leader and deputy secretary are temporarily selected by the mayor of the city and county from among the immigrants. After the general gathering, the transportation committee will observe and select the servants, that is, the collective leader and deputy will select them from among the immigrants.

(6) The remainder of less than ten households shall be compiled into a small group, with one small group leader; the remainder of less than five groups shall be compiled into a small collective, with one small collective leader, and a secretary may be appointed, all selected separately according to the measures in Article 4. (7) After each small group and small collective is transported to each sub-gathering place and the general gathering place, it must be merged with other small groups and small collectives to form a collective. (8) When each city and county transports immigrants to each sub-gathering place, in addition to compiling (groups) (collectives), it must also select appropriate personnel to lead them together, and in addition to sending a telegram summarizing the handling situation, it must also submit a detailed report in another article.

Next, Huang Changgu, the supervisor from the Executive Yuan, gave a speech. Finally, Wu Xingya responded, briefly stating: "Today, I am very grateful to Chairman He of the Central Committee, Commissioner Huang specially sent by the Executive Yuan, and all the guests for participating in my inauguration ceremony. However, in my gratitude, a kind of feeling arises, that Hubei is the area of the first uprising, but after nineteen years, the work of our party has not achieved success. The reason is that a general degeneration of comrades, corruption elements, deterioration elements, for personal rights, have forgotten the party. Now the corruption and deterioration within the party, as well as the Communist Party and the Gui clique, are acting as ghosts and monsters, causing the people to lose their homes and bandits to run rampant. Thinking about the past, I am very heartbroken. I am now under the leadership of Chairman He, serving as Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and I have a greatest determination, that is, to completely abide by the oath to do it. Just now, Chairman He instructed me to choose people for the job, Commissioner Huang told me that the people of Hubei are revolutionary people, and Provincial Party Headquarters Commissioner Liu told us that government personnel and party comrades must work together. I sincerely accept them all, because the party and the government are a whole, party and government cannot be separated, so that party affairs and politics can be jointly developed, and so on." Then the music played and the meeting adjourned, it was already after two o'clock. (March 3rd)</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Fast News</h3>
<p>▲ Zhejiang Province is issuing construction bonds worth 10 million yuan and is actively carrying out the project. Starting this month, the monthly construction expenditure requires 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. Although funds are being raised, it is not enough to meet the urgent needs. It is planned to borrow 2.4 million yuan from the Hangzhou banking industry as a four-month reserve fund. The banking industry is about to open for business in tea and silkworm cocoons, and urgently needs cash to provide assistance, which is really difficult. After trying hard to raise funds, it is only possible to collect 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. It is now learned that the Department of Finance and Construction plans to convene business associations and banks from the five prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing to send one representative each to Hangzhou to discuss loan measures to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>▲ The Zhejiang Relief Committee, in response to the case of all civil servants in various agencies having their salaries reduced and allocated to relief funds in the province, has found that since its implementation, some agencies that should have remitted relief funds have arbitrarily remitted less or have not remitted a single cent. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the Department of Construction, strictly ordering all agencies to quickly remit all outstanding funds from previous months to the committee within ten days of receiving the document. In the future, the funds that should be remitted this month must be received by the 15th of the following month at the latest and must not be delayed. In case of handover, the previous and subsequent incumbents should deduct and remit on a daily basis according to the date of appointment and removal.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Education Bureau's Business Report at the Sixth National Congress of this City (4)</h3>
<p>(5) Insurance for Municipal School Buildings: Municipal school buildings are municipal property, and fires in Shanghai are frequent. If they are not insured, the danger is great. A survey was once conducted on the number of municipal school properties, and insurance methods were proposed, and submitted to the municipal government for review and approval. Now that municipal schools are continuously adding school building insurance, it is even more urgent. It is planned to conduct another survey of the exact number of school properties, submit it to the municipal government for approval, and then take out insurance to ensure safety.</p>
<p>(6) Holding a School Equipment Exhibition: The equipment used in schools is related to education in every aspect. It is necessary to pay attention to whether the height of desks and chairs and the installation of sports equipment are appropriate. Municipal schools in rural areas have not yet uniformly purchased new-style, suitable school equipment. It is planned to hold a school equipment exhibition this semester to display various applicable equipment, so as to promote attention and facilitate improvement. (7) Organizing Educational and Cultural Groups: Due to the large number of educational and cultural groups in the city, the bureau has never had accurate statistics, resulting in a lack of investigation. In October, staff were sent to investigate. All kinds of groups such as music, art, drama, books, and physical education were included in the scope of the investigation. According to the investigation, there are 103 groups in calligraphy, painting, music, drama, art, song, dance, physical education, and academic lectures. Orders have been issued separately to apply for registration.</p>
<p>(8) Planning and Building a Concert Hall: The bureau believes that there is no public gathering place in the city, so it has the idea of building a public concert hall on the vacant land of the Cultural Temple. Experts were hired in November of this year to plan the construction, and drawings were made, requiring approximately 30,000 yuan. The pre-construction funds have been approved by the municipal government to temporarily use the funds transferred from the Gezhi Academy. It is now actively underway.</p>
<h3>Returned Students from the United States the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲ Mr. Wu Xiexun</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Xiexun of Jiangyin graduated from Nanching Middle School in his early years and was excellent in English exams, ranking at the top of the list. Later, he came to Shanghai and met Mr. Zhu Shaoping of the Chinese Students' Christian Association. Mr. Zhu praised his sincerity and vitality and kept him in the association to assist in travel and reception affairs. Mr. Wu was determined to study further. In the autumn of the fourteenth year of the Republic, he raised funds to study in the United States at his own expense. He first entered Northwestern University to specialize in English for one year. Originally, he intended to study aeronautics, but he was saddened by the urgent need to abolish unequal treaties, so he changed his major to political diplomacy, hoping to contribute to the party and the country. He obtained a bachelor's degree last summer and returned to China on the President Fairmount on March 3rd, residing at the East Asia Hotel. Mr. Wu has high aspirations and plans to engage in relevant work in China for a period of time before going to Europe for research and study.</p>

<h3>The National Games is in Full Swing</h3>
<p>▲ Sending Out Discount Train and Ship Tickets: The preparatory office for the National Games, in order to give preferential treatment to the athletes participating in the Games, sent a special letter to the Ministry of Railways and the Shipping Association, requesting that athletes participating in the Games be charged half price, and both were approved. The association specially rushed to make discount train and ship tickets, which have now been made. They will be sent out separately according to the number of athletes participating in the Games replied by each province and city, so that representatives of each province and city can hold the certificates in advance for contact. The original letter is recorded as follows: We respectfully inform you that the Ministry of Railways, the Shanghai Shipping Association, and the Dalian and Zhengji Shipping Companies have kindly agreed to allow athletes participating in the Games to ride on trains and ships at half price. However, because the railway and shipping price reductions are related to national income and merchant capital, the issuance of train and ship discount certificates should be carefully given. People who are not participating in the Games will not be accommodated. Now we are sending you [blank] discount train tickets and [blank] discount ship tickets. Please fill them out for the people in your area participating in the Games. If there are any leftovers, we hope that your representative will bring them back when they come to the meeting for careful verification. In addition, the Shanghai North Station and Hangzhou City Station of our association have reception centers to guide the people participating in the Games to ride the train and other matters. In addition to the fact that our association has sent letters to the Ministry of Railways and the Shanghai Shipping Association to provide convenience to athletes in other stations and shipping bureaus, for the sake of prudence, your provincial representatives should hold tickets in advance for contact in order to facilitate travel.</p>
<p>▲ The Repaired Swimming Pool: Because the venue for the National Games was insufficient, all swimming competitions were planned to be temporarily borrowed from the Zhijiang University swimming pool for the competition, and a letter was immediately sent to the school for emergency repairs in order to make it more complete. Yesterday, we received a reply from the school and attached a budget of 592 yuan for wood-framed seat work, 190 yuan for 60 feet of iron railings, and 110 yuan for repairing the swimming pool, totaling about 800 yuan. Because of the financial constraints, everything is kept simple and thrifty. There are still more grandstand seats that can be moved and used for railings and swimming pools. The letter was approved, and half of the engineering cost, 150 yuan, was attached.</p>
<h3>International Basketball Game: China and the United States Defeat South Korea and Portugal</h3>
<p>▲ The United States Defeats Portugal 100 to 14</p>
<p>▲ China Defeats South Korea 90 to 12</p>
<p>In last night's international basketball game, China and the United States both won. The difference in results was unprecedented. The United States defeated Portugal 100 to 14, while China defeated Korea 90 to 12.</p>
<p>It is undeniable that China and the United States are strong rivals for the championship in this competition. It was expected that they would win over Korea and Portugal by a large margin last night. However, despite the same victory, the United States team showed full spirit throughout the game, while the Chinese team had a hint of playing around in the midst of their overwhelming advantage. As for the defeated Portugal and Korea, they knew they had no hope of winning, but their indomitable spirit did not diminish their performance due to defeat. They still shouldered their mission and worked hard to fight, which is commendable.</p>
<p>The game between the United States and Portugal began at 7:00 PM. The United States launched a full attack with its elite lineup, and Portugal's entire territory was devastated. It was easy to get the ball and score. In the first half, the United States scored 60 and Portugal scored 8. In the second half, the United States continued to make progress with all its strength. After repeatedly changing substitutes, the spirit remained strong. Portugal's veteran Ka Nuo Fo Luo scored the most points, but the rest had no performance, only fulfilled their duties. The result of the game was 100 to 14, with the United States winning. The referee was Smith.</p>
<p>The game between China and Korea followed at 8:00 PM. The strength of China and Korea is like the difference between heaven and earth. After a few rounds, the Chinese athletes showed their skills, advancing, retreating, and moving left and right in an orderly manner. In the first half, Korea only scored two goals, one when the Chinese team scored 22 points and one when they scored 26 points. The score in the first half was China 44, Korea 4. At the beginning of the second half, the Chinese lineup was slightly changed, and the strength of the battle was still considerable. Scoring was as easy as taking something out of a bag. If they could pay more attention to progress, the number of points they could score might surpass the United States. As a result, China won 90 to 12. The referee was Xu Zhendong.</p>

<h3>Four University Basketball Tournament Begins Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Four University Athletic Federation's basketball tournament is scheduled for the 7th, 8th, and 13th of March at Shanghai University in Yangshupu. Participants include Soochow University, Hangzhou Christian College (Zhejiang University), Shanghai University, and University of Nanking. The competition will be a single round-robin format. The schedule for the 3rd will be determined at a meeting of the four universities' staff tonight. Admission tickets are available in two types: 40 cents and 20 cents. The revenue from ticket sales will be used to cover the federation's expenses and to subsidize the travel expenses of each university's basketball team.</p>
<p>▲ Current Strengths (Shanghai University) Last year, when the tournament was held in Nanjing, Shanghai University won the championship by defeating University of Nanking 57-26 and Soochow University 52-24. This year, with the departure of Wen Dingxin, Chuan Wuqiao, and several others from Shanghai University, coupled with the recent holding of the All-China Basketball Tournament, the players are also exhausted. In addition, He Tong, Chen Dingnan, Sun Zemin, Hu Minteng, etc., have either foot or head injuries. Although they can still serve their alma mater, their strength is somewhat diminished. As for geography, Shanghai University has a natural advantage. (Soochow University) Their strength has greatly increased this time, with the addition of veteran guard Wang Jianji, boosting the team's morale. In addition, Chen Fuyu, Wang Shoufang, Luo Zhimei, etc., are all seasoned veterans, so their individual skills have reached perfection. If the whole team can cooperate well, it is not impossible to win the championship. (University of Nanking) The team's strength is average, so the cooperation is very harmonious and fast. The fame of the Ling brothers has spread throughout the new capital. They come with a determination to win, and it is undoubtedly a strong team. (Hangzhou Christian College) It is unknown how strong Hangzhou Christian College is, but Luo Richang, Wu Guolin, etc., used to be strong players in Shanghai University's A team. Now their skills have improved dramatically, far exceeding what they used to be. Therefore, it can be inferred that the team's strength is also very sufficient.</p>

<p>▲ Closing Remarks Comrade Chen Dezheng said in his closing remarks: Fellow representatives, the Municipal Representative Congress has adjourned on the 1st and continues until today.</p>
<p>Except for a day of rest on Sunday, it has been going on for four full days. We solemnly discussed the motions regarding the Municipal Government and visited various departments in groups on Monday. During these four days, we have proceeded very smoothly, solemnly elected executive and supervisory committee members, and meticulously discussed various motions. The spirit and achievements of the congress can be considered the best since the Municipal Representative Congress was established. This achievement is of course attributed to all the representatives, and all the resolutions, I believe, will be followed and implemented by the newly elected executive and supervisory committee members. It can be predicted that the party and government facilities in our city will become increasingly clear in the future. The End.</p>
<p>▲ Telegram to Zhang Xueliang Telegram to Commander Zhang Xueliang Han Qing, Shenyang: I have read your telegram, advocating peace, benevolent words and thin profits, I admire your victory. Peace must be built on the foundation of unity before it is a mere decoration. Therefore, peaceful unification is a consistent policy of the Central Government and a unanimous demand of the people. In recent years, disasters have been frequent, industry and commerce have withered, transportation has been partially blocked, and bandits are rampant. As your telegram said, how can we create internal strife again? However, ambitious warlords and reactionary politicians collude to use harm the Party and the country. In order to maintain unity, the Central Government has no choice but to suppress the rebellion in order to seek true peace. If Yan Xishan had no other intentions and did not advocate strange theories, then peace would have been achieved and unification would have been completed long ago. His recent actions are like being possessed by ghosts, like having a stroke. Detaining vehicles obstructs transportation, convening meetings secretly colludes with bandits, and resisting the reorganization is both obstructing unification and destroying peace. After repeated admonitions from the Central Government, he has never realized his mistakes. He has even gathered military men to agitate his fallacies, and gangsters will support him in the abandoned capital. This is not a dispute of personal political views, but an omen of the Party and the country being in danger. If this is not punished, where will the Party exist? If this is not conquered, where will the national law be? If there is no law and discipline, how can we achieve lasting peace? If there is no peace, how can there be the welfare of the people? You have dedicated yourself to the Party and the country, safeguarding the northern border, and your enthusiasm for safeguarding peace is evident to all. You will also support the Central Government in suppressing the rebellion against the perpetrators who destroy unity and recreate internal strife. You have a clear plan and do not need to be told more. For the special achievements of the revolution for the Party and the country, and for seeking peace and welfare for the people, the Association will send a special telegram to you for your future orders to suppress the rebellion and await your instructions. Shanghai Special City Sixth City Representatives of the Chinese Nationalist Party</p>
<p>▲ Supporting the Congress The Party Department of the Fourth District of the City sent a telegram to the Sixth City Representative Congress of the City yesterday, expressing support, saying: "Shanghai Special City Sixth City Representative Congress, in recent years, the Party and the country have been troubled, the fate of survival is at stake, and the situation is critical. Our city is located in the concession, which is a triple cave for reactionaries to lie in ambush. The communication between China and foreign countries is also expected by the world. At the beginning of political tutelage, there are many things to be done, and we look forward to the Central Plains. The villains are rebellious and clamorous, and the common people are thinking of being treated. We must endure the pain for a moment and hope to be on the seat so that the national pulse can be preserved forever and the people's difficulties can be solved. The Sixth City Representative Congress, just when the curtain has fallen, we are happy to hear the news and rejoice in private. Looking to the future, we have high hopes. How to complete the mission of our party, how to realize the strategy of our party, how to advance the administration of the city, and how to save the suffering of the common people? I hope to be careful from the beginning to the end, make decisive decisions, and support the building, relying on this cornerstone. We dare to lead the people and party members of the whole district to support sincerely. In the face of the telegram, we hope to be bright and aware. The Executive Committee of the Fourth District of the Chinese Nationalist Party, Shanghai Special City, respectfully presents."</p>
<h3>Declaration of the Sixth Municipal Congress</h3>
<p>The declaration of the Sixth Municipal Congress of the Kuomintang of China, Shanghai Special Municipality, is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Our party is a revolutionary party charged with the mission of realizing the Three Principles of the People. All party comrades should follow the late Premier, be loyal and unwavering, and strive arduously for the Three Principles of the People. Although there are many obstacles in the path of the revolution, our determination to complete the revolution is even more firm. Looking back over the past year, the rise of domestic rebels and the surge of reactionary trends in the international arena have not only failed to subdue our will but have also made us more aware of what inspires us. This is clear evidence. As the Sixth Municipal Congress is held, we dare to sincerely tell our compatriots and comrades about the actual struggle of the past environment and our expectations for the future.</p>
<p>(2) In the past year, the most important page in the history of domestic politics was the convocation of the National Army Reorganization and Disbandment Conference. The National Army Reorganization and Disbandment Conference opened on January 1st, but in fact, it began on the 5th and closed on the 25th. This was the starting point for China's true and semi-unification in the future, and it was also the root cause of all the traitors last year. Even Yan Xishan's current attempt to overthrow the government may have originated from this. At that time, there were 23 ex-officio members attending the Reorganization and Disbandment Conference, all of whom were politically and militarily responsible for very important tasks. After deliberating for ten days, they resolved more than 20 proposals, divided into sections and regions, each with specific responsibilities. At that time, the national military strength was more than 1.5 million, and it was planned to retain 800,000 after disbandment. From the General Headquarters to the Group Army Commanders and Army Commanders, all military powers and military salaries were abolished, and all were allocated and handled by the central government. The results of the conference were remarkable. After the conference closed, the provinces successively implemented it, and there were considerable achievements. However, in less than a month, Li Zongren presumptuously dismissed Lu Diping from his post, creating the rebellion of the Guangxi warlords. As a result, the entire reorganization and disbandment plan suffered a setback. Fortunately, through the efforts of the central government, the rebellion was gradually quelled. On August 1st, the National Army Reorganization and Disbandment Conference was convened again, with seven meetings and sixteen resolutions, in order to implement them. Mass organizations also organized disbandment associations to supervise. Unfortunately, there were also rebellions by the Feng faction warlords and Zhang Fakui and Tang Shengzhi. Recently, Yan Xishan has hurriedly followed suit, causing the implementation of the entire reorganization and disbandment plan to be suspended. However, due to these rebellions, we have learned a serious lesson: feudal warlords only know how to raise private soldiers and occupy territories, and they never hope for China's unification. They also know that the people are tired of chaos, so they deliberately use words of peace, but they do not know that the foundation of peace must be built on a unified situation. Talking about peace without unification is no different from pouring oil on a fire. Now Yan Xishan also uses these two words of peace as material for incitement. The people of the country have long seen through his intentions, and they all believe that Yan Xishan's doomsday is not far away. We deeply know that unless the power of feudal warlords gradually disappears, the foundation of true peace and unification cannot be consolidated. Our past efforts to suppress rebellions and support the Reorganization and Disbandment Conference were all based on this deep conviction and fulfilling our responsibilities. Political rebellions are as mentioned above, and ideological rebellions can also be mentioned. After the Second National Congress, the National Government vigorously implemented the construction work of the period of political tutelage. Everything that could benefit the people was done with all efforts. Therefore, on April 20th, an order to protect human rights was promulgated. Unexpectedly, this order to protect human rights led to the exposure of the rebellious traces of ideological rebels. People like Hu Shi brazenly slandered our party and insulted our party's late Premier. However, we firmly believe that our party is based on the Three Principles of the People and takes the interests of the people as the central concept. All forces that hinder the success of the Chinese National Revolution, our party will fight against them with the greatest effort to prevent them from growing. Therefore, in the past, we have suppressed ideological rebels and brought them to justice, all because of our firm belief. The rise of domestic rebellions, from a positive perspective, is enough to鞭策 us and make us the driving force for our advancement. Therefore, we are not only unafraid but also work hard. Unfortunately, in this eventful China, in addition to political and ideological crises, there is also the so-called economic crisis. Since the abolition of the Biederman Treaty, India has been planning to use the gold standard, followed by Japan's lifting of the gold ban, the recovery of European industry after the war, and the result of the increase in silver production over the years, the trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap has risen. Our country's reform of the monetary system is still empty talk. All countries use gold, but our country uses silver alone, which has led to a further decline in the value of national wealth within ten days. The people's livelihood is even more oppressed, and the country's finances suffer even more losses. This kind of economic crisis has a greater impact on the nation than political difficulties. We firmly believe that to save ourselves from destruction, we must encourage productive industries in practice, strive for a balance of exports and imports in the near future, so that the internal economy is solid, transportation is restored, people's lives are peaceful, and then engage in realizing the late Premier's advocacy of the monetary revolution. In the past, we have also made contributions to the economic crisis, all of which were based on this deep conviction. As for the diplomatic aspect, what we feel is nothing but the crystallization of tragedy and bitterness. First, since the Middle East Road Incident occurred on July 10th last year, the Russians have used all means of tyranny and aggression. Until December, the United States and France, as initiators of the non-war pact, announced that China and Russia should abide by the pact. Other countries have risen up to advise, and the situation has eased slightly. The Russian side, seeing that its cunning plan had succeeded, also expressed its willingness to reopen Sino-Russian peace talks for direct negotiations. Our country sent a representative, Cai Yunsheng, to伯力 to hold a Sino-Russian preparatory meeting to make preliminary contacts. Unexpectedly, Cai Yunsheng overstepped his authority and signed a draft treaty of ten items, which aroused the condemnation of the people of the country. The National Government then summoned Mo Dehui, the supervisor of the Middle East Road, to Beijing to discuss rectification measures. As a result, (a total of four items were obtained, which can save the disadvantages to a certain extent. However, the losses suffered due to the Sino-Russian negotiations are actually the greatest tragedy for the whole nation since the founding of the Republic of China. Second, in the past year, the diplomatic authorities have seemed to spare no effort in abolishing不平等條約. However, apart from making the unimportant Mexico voluntarily give up consular jurisdiction, what are the so-called concrete achievements? It is quite difficult to answer. Repeatedly sending notes to countries such as Britain, the United States, and France to request the cancellation of consular jurisdiction has been rejected, and the result is almost zero. As for Japan, although the name is expired, in fact, the special rights have not been effectively abandoned. Japanese residing in our country are still subject to the jurisdiction of their country's consuls, which is enough to prove that although the legal basis of consular jurisdiction has disappeared, its factual existence is still enough to infringe on China's territory and sovereignty. In addition to悲痛, we cannot but hope that the diplomatic authorities will follow the late Premier's遺敎 to take decisive measures. The above two items are major events in diplomacy. We have also tried our best to do various propagandas for this purpose, so that the people can rise up and become the backing of the central government. However, due to the poor environment, the effectiveness of propaganda has been reduced a lot, and no attention has been paid to international propaganda. This is what we regret.</p>
<p>(3) From an international perspective, the conflicts between international imperialists have intensified in the past year. On the surface, the voice of peace seems to be still very high. In fact, the imperialists are stepping up their efforts to build炮艦, expand military equipment, and prepare to fight with the weak and small nations all over the world. The explanations are as follows: (1) Since the Kellogg-Briand Pact was established, the imperialists have unanimously praised it as the dawn of human peace. In fact, in this pact, in addition to a few inherited empty clauses, there is no practical method on how to prevent war and how to eliminate military equipment. In fact, all countries are engaged in amazing plans to expand large battleships, submarines, aircraft, and armies. After the pact was announced, the war between Poland and Lithuania, the French attack on Morocco and Syria, and the赤俄violence against our country and the massacre in our country were all unheard of by the signing countries of the non-war pact, which proves that this pact is purely a kind of euphemism for embellishing peace. We have explained this point to the people in the past. (2) History诏示 us that the so-called League of Nations is a group of imperialists瓜分ing spoils, which is consistent with the Holy Alliance of the nineteenth century. Therefore, the League's Disarmament Conference is no different from holding it to solve the weak and small nations. Therefore, the League's Disarmament Conference on April 15th last year closed. Our country's representative proposed to abolish the微兵制, but it was not the result, which proves that our forecast is correct. For this point, we have揭破 its inside story, so that those who believe that world peace and unification can be obtained from this way are惊惕. (3) We have already指斥 the League's Disarmament Conference for deceiving itself. After the Disarmament Conference, there was the so-called Five-Power London Naval Disarmament Conference. This kind of assembly is no different from the League's Disarmament Conference. They are all瓜分ing conferences initiated by imperialists to save the declining last luck. Recently, due to the issue of the survival of submarines and the ratio of auxiliary ships, there is a trend that is close to breaking. This is a scene of imperialists exposing their cruel faces. It is our responsibility to strive to explain the inside story of this kind of meeting, so that our people can be惊惕. It is also our past efforts. (4) Although the international situation in the past year has presented a new stability due to the solution of the German compensation problem and the implementation of the Rhine evacuation, the evil胎 of the Second World War has long been濳伏. Once it encounters a fuse, it will暴裂. We try to observe the military expenditure budgets of the so-called powers, such as the United States, which increased by 164,000,000 US dollars for the army and 317,310,000 US dollars for the navy compared to the previous year. France's budget last year was 2.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>583,000,000法郎, Britain's budget last year was 700,000,000 pounds. The other countries are also increasing. For example, the launch of the large cruiser in the United States, and the other countries are also building a number of cruisers. Germany also has a 10,000-ton cruiser launched. All of these are enough to indicate that the imperialists are actively preparing for war. The outbreak of the Second World War, the first to bear the brunt, will be our country. This kind of可　the potential crisis, we have loudly called for the whole people to prepare urgently, so as to avoid the tragic result of the national滅落. (5) When the imperialists are preparing for a big fight, the weak and small nations have not甘忍受剝削 and rise up in revolution. In the past year, the national revolutionary movements of the weak and small nations such as India, Korea, Mexico, the Philippines, Afghanistan, Arabia, Morocco, and the Jews have surged. Although the results may not be all good, the voices of the weak and small nations demanding freedom and equality have響澈雲霄. The foundations of the imperialists have been subjected to extremely violent shaking. This kind of新生's機運 is what our party and the late Premier昔日诏示 us. We should not only give the greatest assistance to the遺敎 of the late Premier联合 the world's nations that treat me equally and strive together, but also宜爲其領導. Some of the comrades in our party are请建立 the三民主義's靑色國際, which is this meaning. Looking at the international situation in the past year, we deeply believe that the international imperialists will enter the tomb door. In the period of this gradually collapsing trend, the imperialists will surely show their last struggle and fight with the weak and small nations all over the world. Our country is the object of the imperialists' last struggle and fight. In the past year, our nation has suffered heavy oppression, which is 生化此故. This city is the大本營 where the imperialists implement aggression and oppression in our country. Therefore, the suffering endured by the people of this city is also greater. However, this kind of oppression and suffering is not enough to餒吾人之氣, and it makes our determination to destroy the imperialists' nests even more determined. In the past year, we have not dared to懈稍 in the anti-imperialist movement and the aid to the weak and small nations movement. This is also enough to 吿慰 comrades and compatriots.</p>
<p>(4) From the above, we can see that in the past year, the domestic environment was very恶劣, and the international situation was even more不良. Due to such an environment, the municipal party headquarters could only do its best to fulfill the responsibility of awakening the people in the negative aspect. In the positive aspect, such as making the comrades have good organization and training, making the whole city's people receive appropriate guidance, and completing their obligations as citizens, making the political of this city get frequent supervision and have a long progress, there have been no practical efforts. This is really what the Congress regrets. More importantly, because the amount of negative work is too much, the progress of the comrades in our party in terms of learning and skills has been reduced a lot, and the comrades in our party have tended to be romantic,随落,急燥 in action due to the lack of good supervision. Ideologically, there is also a trend of being naive,剛愎,混雜 due to the lack of good指正. This is also what the Congress thinks is痛心. In view of the past shortcomings, this meeting deeply feels that if we want to correct something, there is no other way to find except the late Premier's遺敎. Therefore, based on 遺訓, the direction of future work is揭藥 below. (1) In terms of party affairs, in addition to tightening its organization, expanding its propaganda, and stepping up its training, we should pay more attention to the磨礪 of integrity and shame among comrades, the发挥 of party virtue, the 明辯 of righteousness and profit, and the cultivation of学識. As for training the people, in addition to continuing to整顿民衆團體, we will pay more attention to the cultivation of the concept of respecting the party and abiding by the law, the expansion of improving the people's livelihood movement, the training of the four powers, and the completion of national obligations. (2) In terms of administration, the first priority is to complete the work of the period of political tutelage, so that there will never be any苛捐雜稅流行 in this city, and life, property, business, and farming will have extremely safe保障. Bandits and thieves will絶其足跡 within the area of this city, and the農工商業 will not see the appearance of凋零, and production will be日見增加, social order will be長保 its stability, and educational undertakings will have long progress, and educational expenses will also be fully supplied, so that this city will have no children and young people who lose their education, and no adults who suffer from being unable to 求學 and not knowing how to read. As for the修築 of roads and the measurement of land, it is essential to complete local autonomy, and we hope to complete its work as soon as possible. As for striving to recover the租界 and unify the治權 movement, in order to completely realize the late Premier's Great Shanghai Plan, the Congress hopes that the municipal government can make further奮鬥. Furthermore, the Congress wants to solemnly declare that in addition to the above-mentioned work direction, such as eliminating feudal forces, correcting reactionary thoughts, solving the economic crisis, abolishing unequal treaties, destroying imperialism, and helping weak and small nations, we will, of course, 死力以赴 with the late Premier's遺訓. It is hoped that the city's compatriots and our party will give the greatest赞助 and give our party strict督責. This is especially what the Congress is looking forward to. This is the declaration.</p>
<h3>Municipal Representative Assembly Resolution on Rectifying Party Affairs</h3>
<p>▲Resolution on Rectifying Party Affairs　The party affairs rectification in this city has been completed for a year. After examining the situation over the past year, it is known that the party affairs in the city, due to the turmoil of all reactionaries, have failed to fulfill the work that should be done during the period of political tutelage. The only guiding principle for improving party affairs in the future is to fulfill the work that should be done during the period of political tutelage, so that Shanghai becomes a model city that first completes the work of political tutelage. Based on this goal, the first thing that should be done is to enable the municipal department to have sufficient guidance to comrades and supervision of the government. The organizational system of the municipal department should maintain its functional network, and all tasks should be expedited to fully exert its guidance and supervision functions. The meaning of connection is that every task must be the work of the entire municipal department, and every action must be the action of the entire municipal department. Therefore, the municipal department must first analyze its nature before any action or task, and determine the distribution plan. Which department should be responsible for which part, and at the same time, during the process, find ways to make each part adapt to each other. Therefore, the work of each department and council of the municipal department should be reported to the municipal executive committee, and the municipal executive committee should examine whether it is appropriate and re-determine how to proceed. The meaning of speed is, on the one hand, to enrich the capabilities of the staff. The selection of staff should be based on ability, and ways should be found to increase their abilities at any time, such as organizing various research groups and discussion groups to increase their working abilities. Then, there is hope for gradual progress in the work. On the one hand, it is to improve the work procedure. Any work should be examined at any time to see if there are any uneconomical aspects and find ways to correct it. If this is the case, the work of the municipal department will become more and more rapid, and the ability to guide and supervise can also be increased accordingly. The second is to improve the relationship between organizations at all levels. According to the organizational system of special municipalities, the district party headquarters is the hub of the organization. In addition to the role of forwarding and conveying information, the district party headquarters must have the ability to effectively guide the work of the sub-district branches. If the district party headquarters is not sound, the party affairs of the entire city can be in an unsound state. Therefore, the most important task of the city's party affairs in the future is to build a sound district party headquarters. The municipal department should pay special attention to guiding and supervising the work of the district party headquarters, enriching its working strength, and enabling it to have sufficient ability to guide the sub-district branches. The third is to enhance the relationship between party members and the party. The relationship between party members and the party is in the sub-district branches, but today's sub-district branches have almost no work, and even various meetings cannot be convened as scheduled. However, the sub-district branch is the basic organization of the party, an educational institution internally, and an activity center externally. Therefore, if the sub-district branch is not sound, party affairs cannot progress. The methods for making all sub-district branches sound are as follows: A. Reduce the technical work of sub-district branches so that they have the energy to pay attention to other work. B. Increase the working ability of sub-district branch staff. C. The superior party headquarters should guide the sub-district branches on how to prepare for various meetings and enrich their content, so that party members are interested in the sub-district branch meetings. D. In sub-districts with large numbers of people, the organization of small groups should be strictly implemented.</p>
<p>▲Resolution on Rectifying the Administration of the City　It is found that the scope of administration of this city is not limited to the municipal government alone. Therefore, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government is not a government that manages the municipality of Shanghai Special Municipality, but the government of Shanghai Special Municipality, the meaning of which is very clear. Since the establishment of the municipal government, the achievements have been remarkable, but there are still some that do not meet our expectations. Therefore, the following resolutions are made: (1) The municipal organization law has been determined in principle by the central government and is expected to be promulgated soon. However, the laws and regulations concerning the election of citizens have not yet been established. It should be requested that the central government instruct the Legislative Yuan to formulate them as soon as possible to provide information for the party headquarters to train the people through political means. In addition, local autonomy has been clearly ordered by the national government, and some provinces and cities have already implemented it. It should be submitted to the central government to quickly determine the implementation methods and start date of local autonomy in this city to complete the work of political tutelage. (2) All institutions within the scope of this city that do not belong to the municipal government are equivalent to being set up in vain, such as the Shanghai offices of various ministries and commissions of the central government, and there are redundant branches, such as the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau and the Cigarette Tax Bureau, etc., which have not yet been explicitly ordered to be abolished. The central government should be requested to instruct the national government to abolish them as soon as possible to save public funds and unify governance. (3) There are still institutions in this city that are directly under the Jiangsu Provincial Government, such as the Shanghai County Government, etc., which have not yet been relocated, which is detrimental to the administration of this city. There are also educational institutions that are directly under the Jiangsu Provincial Government, such as Shanghai Middle School and Aquatic Products School, etc., which disrupt the educational administration of this city, and also confuse the educational powers of the province and the city. The central government should be requested to instruct the National Government to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to move out immediately or be incorporated into the municipal government for management, so that the administration of this city can be free from obstacles and become more vigorous. (4) The organization of the Secretariat of the Municipal Government seems to be inappropriate. Two section members or clerks refute the work progress plans of the competent bureaus. Not only is their talent insufficient to achieve the effect of exploration, but also because of personal preferences, it hinders the progress of administration. The municipal government should be requested to improve it properly and re-draft the organizational rules of the secretariat so that the progress of all business will not be relaxed. (5) The Municipal Finance Bureau has made considerable achievements in the consolidation of finance. However, the collection of all donations and taxes should be based on the ability of the people to bear. If the tax revenue is too small and makes the people feel hardship, it should be touched and exempted, so that the people of this city will never feel harshly governed. As for the tax revenue of this city, except for national taxes, it should be collected by the bureau to be used as funds for local construction. The distribution of expenditures is also not appropriate. For example, the public security expenditure has been increasing, the educational expenditure has been decreasing in proportion to the total expenditure of the city, and the amount used for construction and for (solving the difficulties of the people) is very short, which should be corrected. (6) The achievements of the Municipal Land Bureau in the past year have been more advanced than before. However, after the recovery of the General Measurement Bureau, there have been no concrete measures for the consolidation of property title deeds and the recovery of huge losses caused by property title deeds. The municipal government should be requested to supervise the Land Bureau to handle it effectively. (7) The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau seems to lack effort in the consolidation of charitable institutions. Half of the reason is due to insufficient funding, and half is due to the control of scoundrels. The municipal government should be requested to increase the funding for social undertakings and find ways to eradicate the bad habits of scoundrels. However, there are many bankrupt industrial and commercial enterprises in this city, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. There are still no concrete relief measures. The municipal government should be requested to instruct the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct practical research so that the stability of the society in this city can be guaranteed. (8) The achievements of the Municipal Engineering Bureau in the past year still cannot satisfy the expectations of the citizens. The Zhongshan Road has not yet been completed, which is a great regret. Moreover, in the case of the collapse of the new house in Ximen, the people have many complaints, saying that the construction factories that have not been approved by the Engineering Bureau are careful in everything and are also criticized. Those who have been favored by the Engineering Bureau can obtain considerable assistance even if everything is inappropriate. These kinds of rumors may not be groundless. The municipal government should be requested to order the Engineering Bureau to be loyal to its duties and not to harm the public for personal gain. (9) The impression given to the citizens of Shanghai by the Municipal Public Security Bureau is getting worse and worse. The funding has been increased, but the police force is still thin. The illegal rules have been explicitly abolished, but the bribes cannot be compensated. Secret prostitutes are everywhere, and the bandit dens have not been cleared. Municipal commissioners under the municipal government have even been kidnapped. The reason for this is that the Municipal Public Security Bureau is only making superficial exaggerations, and lacks practical training for the police. The official style has not been eliminated, and the people's resentment is rising. The municipal government should be requested to reorganize it effectively. (10) The Municipal Health Bureau is still working hard on public health, but unqualified doctors have not been strictly banned, and there are still reports of endangering people's lives. The bureau should be asked to pay attention to this. (11) The Municipal Education Bureau has made great efforts in the past year in the passive consolidation of school education, such as banning private schools, and has also made considerable achievements in rectifying the academic style, such as consolidating teachers' and staff organizations. However, social education cannot have equal development with school education, which is a great regret. The reason for this is the shortage of education funds. It has been decided that the education funds of this city should account for one-fourth of the city's total revenue. This year's budget has not reached one-fifth of the city's total revenue, which is not appropriate. Moreover, the bureau is too demanding on school building fees, etc., which makes poor children feel that they have no place to study. The municipal government should be requested to maintain the case that education funds account for one-fourth of the city's total revenue, and order the bureau to effectively develop social education, widely set up free places, increase work-study schools, implement the substitute school plan, raise funds for parks and libraries, and expand sports fields. If the funds are still insufficient, the central government should be requested to confiscate all the temples and temple properties in the city to allocate them. As for the education in the concessions, the bureau has not heard of proper planning methods. The municipal government should be requested to instruct the bureau to earnestly plan and handle it so that before the recovery of the concessions, the prior recovery of the education rights of the concessions can be seen. (12) The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has made considerable efforts in the work of supervising public utilities. However, the major ministries in charge of the capital city have many constraints, resulting in the failure of all plans of the Public Utilities Bureau. It should be submitted to the central government to instruct the competent ministries to manage the public utilities of the localities, regardless of size, by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. (13) The Municipal Port Affairs Bureau has not yet started the plan for the great port of the East. The reason for this is also due to the lack of unified governance. For example, the Dredging Bureau is still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in an inappropriate situation, and the authority of the bureau has not been clarified due to the disputes of the competent ministries of the capital city. The municipal government should be requested to increase the business funds of the bureau and supervise the bureau to carry out the work effectively. The central government should be requested to instruct the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to infringe on local governance, and quickly transfer the Dredging Bureau to the management of the municipal government, and cancel the establishment of the Shipping Administration Bureau. As for the main rivers in the hinterland of western Shanghai, the Pu Zhao River, which is the main waterway for water transportation, the municipal government should be requested to instruct the bureau to dredge them as soon as possible to benefit the people. (14) The failure to unify the governance of this city is a major shortcoming. In terms of finance, taxes such as slaughter tax have not yet been transferred to this city for collection. In terms of construction, the Telephone Bureau is still in the hands of the Ministry of Communications, and the Dredging Bureau is still in the hands of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In terms of public security, the command of the water police is also confused. In terms of education, the primary and secondary schools that are not under the jurisdiction of the municipal education administrative organs still exist, which are all real examples. The central government should be instructed to instruct the Executive Yuan to handle it effectively so that this city becomes a model city in the East to enhance China's position in the international arena. In addition, the townships such as Qibao, which should be incorporated into the urban area, have not yet been received by the municipal government. The municipal government should be requested to implement them as soon as possible. (15) The municipal commissioners in various districts of this city are mostly muddleheaded, corrupt, uneducated, and behave like local bullies, which are obstacles to the development of municipal administration. The municipal government should be requested to re-elect the municipal commissioners in various districts and conduct a practical assessment of the original municipal commissioners to determine who should stay and who should leave. (16) This city is a large trading port. The rapid advancement of material civilization has made the customs of the city thin, and the nearby rural areas are becoming increasingly declining. The municipal government should pay attention to this. If the Garden City Plan can be implemented to avoid repeating the failures of urban construction in Europe and the United States, it will be especially appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Government Prepares to Recover the French Municipal Council</h3>
<p>▲Will Contact the French Envoy</p>
<p>The judicial and diplomatic authorities believe that the problem of the Public Concession Court has been resolved, and the recovery of the French Concession Mixed Court should also be actively carried out. The methods have been drafted and will be notified to the French envoy, or when the French envoy Ma Tai'er comes to Beijing, negotiations will be conducted again.</p>
<h3>The Cancellation of the South Seas Folk Bureau General Package Did Not Originate in China</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of cancelling the South Seas Folk Bureau general package method, it was reported a few days ago that the representatives of overseas Chinese met with the Governor of Singapore. The Governor said that it was originated by the Chinese government. The postal authorities in our country immediately sent a telegram to inquire because it was inconsistent with the facts. It is heard that the British postal authorities have replied, and they have immediately forwarded it to the Ministry of Communications for verification. The telegram to the ministry is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing Minister of Communications, Deputy Minister, I would like to report that on February 26, Shanghai newspapers published a news item about overseas Chinese in Singapore requesting a reduction in postage. The Governor of Singapore and the Postmaster General said that this initiative was actually a letter from the Chinese government requesting cancellation, etc. According to this, the British postal authorities requested the cancellation of the Folk Bureau several times by telegram and letter starting in August last year. The sections reported are inconsistent with the facts. I immediately sent a telegram to inquire. Today, I received a reply from the British Kuala Lumpur Post Office, which read: I respectfully acknowledge your telegram. Regarding the case of private letter offices, when meeting with the representatives of overseas Chinese at the Governor's Office in Singapore on January 20, we did not say that the proposal to cancel the general package special preferential measures of the Folk Bureau originated from the Chinese government, etc. This is reported for your verification. Acting Postmaster General Lin Shi Kouchu, Song,</p>
<h3>Lin Yishun Appeals for the South Seas Folk Letter Office</h3>
<p>Lin Yishun telegraphed the Nanjing Party and government authorities yesterday, saying: The Third Executive and Supervisory Committee, Chairman Jiang of the National Government, and the heads of various hospitals, I would like to report that the increase in postage of the South Seas Folk Letter Office is of great importance to the lives of overseas Chinese workers. It has been submitted to the National Government several times, and representatives have been promoted to Beijing to appeal for the alleviation of the difficulties of the overseas Chinese and for a reduction in the amount. Now I have received a telegram from Li Weinan, the president of the Singapore Chamber of Commerce and acting chairman of the general meeting of the overseas Chinese requesting to retain the Folk Letter Office, saying: The British government said that the increase in postage was advocated by the Chinese government and will be implemented on April 1, etc. Thinking that overseas Chinese workers go to foreign lands to run their own lives, the government has not been able to fulfill its responsibility to protect them, but wants to borrow hands from other ethnic groups and make compatriots feel the economic pain and increase the unexpected burden. This kind of suicidal policy will make friendly countries laugh at you. Yishun is ignorant, I don't know what he is doing. I am afraid that the government may not have this move, and the post office does not know the overall situation, makes its own cleverness, flatters the superior and bullies the inferior. The gentlemen embody the spirit of the Prime Minister's concern for the people's livelihood and the policy of protecting overseas Chinese. Please try your best to reverse the situation to relieve the difficulties of the overseas Chinese. I specially telegraphed to appeal, please consider it carefully. Singapore, President of the General Assembly of the Overseas Chinese Requesting to Retain the Folk Letter Office, Lin Yishun Kouchu, Song,</p>

<h3>Construction of Zhongshan Road in This City</h3>
<p>▲The Entire Road Will Be Completed in Half a Year</p>
<p>▲Traffic Can Be Opened After the Bridge Is Completed</p>
<p>The Municipal Engineering Bureau, in view of the obstruction of north-south traffic in this city, formulated a plan to build Zhongshan Road (now called Zhongshan South Road) in the spring of the 17th year. The road starts from Longhua Town in the south and connects to Jiaotong Road in Zhabei in the north. The entire road is about 20 Chinese miles long. It is estimated that the cost of land acquisition, road construction, and trench burial will be about 2 million yuan. Considering the huge project and economic support, a phased construction method was formulated. The first phase is to fill the roadbed, temporarily lay coal ash, plant trees, and build bridges and culverts. The second phase is to bury the main trench, lay a solid road surface, and use soldiers to open the roadbed first, so as to see its completion as soon as possible. Since the construction started on April 18 in the 17th year, the troops were constantly transferred and the work was often suspended, so the progress was delayed. By January of the 18th year, due to military influence, the soldiers could not take care of road construction, so regular workers were hired to continue the construction. Due to the limited funds, it was not possible to carry out the construction on a large scale. It was not until the end of July last year that the entire roadbed was completed. According to statistics, the expenditure in one year was only more than 14,000 yuan. At that time, all kinds of plans for bridges and culverts were also ready. Only because of the exhaustion of funds until the winter of last year, it was possible to bid for construction separately, and coal ash was added to the road surface. Now, the base of the road has been completed long ago, trees have been planted on both sides, and the culverts and coal ash road surface have also been completed. Once the bridge over the Suzhou River is completed, the entire road can be opened to traffic. Recently, the Municipal Engineering Bureau has felt the economic difficulties, and the previous view has not been slightly reduced. However, it does not slacken the progress of the main roads of the city. Now Zhongshan North Road, the extension line of South Road, has started from Jiaotong Road on February 1 this year and is being extended northward. The road will reach Jiangwan and connect with the city center area.</p>
<h3>Request to Change the County Consolidation Committee</h3>

<h3>The Tortuous and Bizarre Case of the Shouhe Kangji Sugar Store Theft</h3>
<p>▲Two Mistresses Jointly Bind One Concubine Husband</p>
<p>▲The Concubine Is Imprisoned and Her Son Sues Her Father</p>
<p>▲Xu Wenfu Is Also Implicated</p>
<p>▲The Truth About the Sugar Store Robbery Is Like This</p>
<p>Local Xu Wenfu, (also known as Xu Gengen, nicknamed Leather Shoe Gengen,) was arrested by detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau in cooperation with detectives from the Lao Zha Bu Fang at the Ziyang Inn on Hankou Road a few days ago, and escorted to the Provisional Court, accusing him of being involved in the robbery of more than 26,900 silver dollars from the Shouhe Kangji Sugar Store in Xiaodongmen. After Gao Tuishi's interrogation, the defendant was detained pending the arrival of a document from the Public Security Bureau to transfer him. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Gao Tuishi continued the interrogation. The Public Security Bureau has sent a document to the court, requesting a transfer. Xu Wenfu hired lawyer Ye Fukang to defend, claiming that there were false accusations in this case and that the internal situation was very complicated. The person who reported the case, Zhang Hongyuan's father Songquan, used to work at the Donghua Yarn Factory and had two mistresses. One was Hongyuan's mother, who lived in Zhoujiazhai, Linqing Road. Last year, Songquan sold his private farmland and obtained about 10,000 yuan. Hongyuan's mother then demanded the money but failed to obtain it, so she colluded with Songquan's other mistress named Xia Liuliu to kidnap Songquan and demand 4,000 gold for ransom. Songquan secretly escaped and reported to the Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau. As a result, the two mistresses were arrested and punished. Hongyuan hated his father's ruthlessness, which led to his mother's imprisonment, so he reported to the Public Security Bureau that his father Songquan had colluded with a gang to rob the sugar store. The defendant Xu Wenfu had previously helped Songquan reprimand his mistress, so Hongyuan also took this grudge and accused Xu of robbing the store with his father. In the last court hearing, Hongyuan said that his father had already fled without a trace, which was not true. Now he has invited Songquan to testify. Gao Tuishi first asked Zhang Hongyuan if there was such a thing. Zhang immediately said that the kidnapping was a false accusation by his father, and the rest of his words were contradictory. Then he questioned Zhang Songquan, who confessed that Hongyuan was born to his mistress. Last year, he sold the property for 10,400 yuan. Hongyuan's mother demanded the money from him but he did not give it, so on December 20, she colluded with Xia Liuliu and came to his house in two cars. There were also two people in the car who looked like soldiers, impersonating personnel from the Garrison Headquarters, and took him to Xia Liuliu's house, demanding 4,000 gold for ransom. He escaped in the middle of the night and reported to the headquarters, which arrested his two mistresses and sentenced Hongyuan's mother to four years and six months in prison, and Xia to six years and eight months in prison. His son Hongyuan, because his mother was convicted, falsely accused him of being a thief. He was summoned twice, but because there was no evidence, he was ordered to sign a bond and go out, etc. The lawyer from the police station said after hearing his confession that it was completely a family dispute, and the case could not be clarified. He asked the court to instruct Xu Wenfu to post bail and go to the Public Security Bureau to defend himself, etc. Gao Tuishi then instructed Xu Wenfu to pay a deposit of 500 yuan, guaranteeing that he would be available whenever summoned, and to go to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. The detectives from the Public Security Bureau were not satisfied that they were not allowed to take the transferred person away immediately, so they requested that Gao Tuishi state this in the reply document. Gao Tuishi instructed that since the defendant had been granted bail, if he did not arrive, the guarantor would be responsible, so don't worry. The detective then withdrew.</p>
<h3>An Indian Policeman Directing Traffic Accidentally Shot</h3>
<p>▲Incident Occurred at the Intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road</p>
<p>▲Shot While High on the Platform</p>
<p>▲Bullet Exited from His Own Holstered Gun</p>
<p>▲Traffic Stalled for a Long Time</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:30, an Indian traffic policeman, Dadishin Fu, from the Old Zhabei Police Station, was on duty inside the traffic control booth, operating the red and green lights at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road when suddenly a loud bang was heard. The Indian policeman fell on the platform, and then his rifle fell to the ground. At that time, the traffic on the road was quite congested. After waiting for a long time without seeing the signal change, pedestrians approached the platform to investigate. They all said that the Indian policeman had fallen because he was injured. Soon after, another Indian policeman, Bada Huaxin, climbed onto the platform via a small ladder and saw that Ditashin Fu was leaning against the seat, with a gunshot wound to his left chest. He immediately used the telephone to report to the Old Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched an ambulance to take the injured policeman to the police hospital for treatment. It was found that the bullet had penetrated his left lung and he was already unconscious. It was heard that the bullet came from his own rifle. The injury was apparently caused by carelessness. The policeman is 44 years old and has been serving in the police station for 16 years.</p>
<h3>A Tobacco Paper Shop Employee Elopes with a Girl</h3>
<p>▲Absent for a Week</p>
<p>▲Still Claims No Relationship</p>
<p>Fan Xiubao, a girl, lives at the Fan He Tai tobacco paper shop on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei. Recently, she fell in love with Cha De Zhang, an employee of the shop, and they became deeply attached to each other. A week ago, they took the opportunity to run away with some belongings, intending to flee to Huangdu with her lover to live together. Unexpectedly, she was discovered by her mother, and unwilling to return home, she was taken to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲Exquisite Beauty　Fan Xiubao is seventeen years old, with bright eyes and white teeth, an exquisite beauty. Both parents are alive, and the family is considered well-off. Her father, Fan Honggui, and mother, Wang, are both over forty years old. Her father owns the Fan He Tai tobacco paper shop, which also sells food, and business is booming. Because Xiubao is clever and lovely, she is doted on. At the age of nine, she was sent to Peicai Girls' School. Xiubao was quite intelligent and topped her class, earning praise from teachers. Later, she developed eye problems, and her mother, unwilling for her daughter to suffer from illness while studying, asked her to stay home to recuperate and assist with the shop's affairs.</p>
<p>▲Handsome Young Man　As Fan Honggui's business grew, the existing employees were overwhelmed. Therefore, in September of last year, he hired Cha De Zhang, from Wusong, as an employee. Cha is twenty-one years old, originally from Songjiang, but moved to Wusong. He has an elderly mother at home and received several years of education. He is also a handsome young man. He earns seven yuan a month and works diligently, which Fan appreciates very much.</p>
<p>▲Vows of Eternal Love　After Cha De Zhang was hired at Fan He Tai, he saw that the shop owner's daughter was graceful and charming, and often thought of seducing her. Xiubao also thought that Cha was talented and handsome, and they often talked intimately, ostensibly discussing academic matters, but secretly whispering sweet nothings. Their feelings grew deep, and Xiubao, with her weak will, made vows of eternal love, wishing to become a couple. Her parents were completely unaware.</p>
<p>▲Planning to Elop　After Cha and Xiubao became romantically involved, Cha, realizing that he was poor and she was rich, feared that they could not become a couple. He persuaded Xiubao that to be together forever, they must elope to fulfill their wishes. However, Xiubao was unwilling to leave her family and replied, "You (referring to Cha) should be patient. When the time is ripe, things will naturally fall into place. Don't be too hasty."</p>
<p>▲Searching Everywhere　A few days ago, Mr. and Mrs. Fan went out for business. Cha saw that the opportunity was not to be missed and forced Xiubao to take clothes and silver dollars and flee to Wusong to hide. When the Fans returned to the shop and found their daughter missing, they did not pay much attention at first. But when she did not return late at night, they became extremely anxious and searched everywhere. Cha pretended to be concerned and offered to help search.</p>
<p>▲Secret Investigation　Mrs. Fan Wang was constantly worried after the dissapearance of her beloved daughter, eating and sleeping poorly. Burning incense and candles, she prayed to the gods for blessings, hoping that her daughter would return. Thinking this was suspicious, she secretly investigated and indeed found clues. However, since things had already reached this point, she did not want to publicize it and said kindly to Cha, "If my daughter is in love with you, please tell me her whereabouts quickly. I will not pursue the matter and will help you to be together." Unexpectedly, Cha said, "I am also a scholar. How could I do such illegal things? Don't make false accusations. You must know that ruining someone's reputation is the same as murder, especially for young people like us. Be careful."</p>
<p>▲Indeed Saw Her Daughter　After Mrs. Fan Wang was threatened by Cha's stern words, her doubts were dispelled. However, her husband still did not give up. The day before yesterday, he went to Cha's house in Wusong with his wife to look for her. Unexpectedly, as soon as they entered the door, they saw their daughter casually looking out from upstairs. Just as they were about to go upstairs to arrest her, Xiubao noticed it early, went directly to the balcony, and escaped by crossing the fence. Fan quickly went outside to search, but she had already disappeared. He quickly returned to the shop, intending to question Cha De Zhang. Unexpectedly, Cha had also heard the news and secretly took several silver dollars and fled.</p>
<p>▲Narrowly Met　Fan knew that the truth was out, but because his reputation was at stake, he kept it secret. He only searched in every way. Yesterday, Mrs. Wang went to the Qi family on Gonghe Road in Zhabei to ask for help in finding her. On the way home, she forgot to bring her umbrella. As it was raining heavily, she went to the Ruixiang Foreign Goods Store nearby to buy an umbrella. Who knew that enemies would meet on a narrow road? She saw Cha, an employee, also shopping. She immediately stepped forward to ask him. Cha, feeling guilty, turned around and went out the door, fleeing to Xinmin Road, where he and Xiubao took a rickshaw and drove north. Mrs. Wang immediately caught up and told the tenth neighborhood watch police to drag Cha and her daughter out of the rickshaw. She persuaded her to return home, but Xiubao was unwilling. She took Cha to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau. She asked someone to temporarily send her daughter to her uncle's house on Gordon Road. Director Jin questioned Cha, who confessed that he had intended to take Xiubao to Huangdu to hide. Unexpectedly, he met Mrs. Wang and was arrested at the bureau. However, this matter was completely consensual, and there was no physical relationship, etc. The verdict was that the case involved the abduction of a girl, and he was ordered to be handed over to the Judicial Section for review.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Requests Divorce</h3>
<p>(Three Reasons) (1) Engagement Without Personal Consent</p>
<p>(2) Husband Visits Prostitutes and Contracts a Disease</p>
<p>(3) Repeated Abuse by In-Laws and Husband's Younger Brother</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang Chen has recently hired lawyer Zhou Boang to file a petition in the local court for a divorce from her husband, Zhang Nian. Her reasons are threefold: (1) The engagement years ago was entirely decided by her mother, without her personal consent; (2) The defendant does not engage in honest work, ignores the family, and spends his days wandering around and visiting prostitutes, resulting in contracting a disease and even paralysis; (3) Repeated abuse by her in-laws and her husband's younger brother, etc. The defendant, Zhang Nian, also submitted a defense. Yesterday, Judge Yang Keqian opened a court session to hear the case. The plaintiff, Mrs. Zhang Chen, stated that she is 25 years old, a native of Shanghai, and recounted the previous events, requesting permission for a divorce. The judge asked where she currently lives. She replied that she left her husband's home and is temporarily living on Laobazi Road, inside Ximen. The judge said that there is no Laobazi Road in Ximen. Where do you live exactly? The woman hesitated for a moment, and stammered that she lives at 236 Tangjiawan, inside Ximen. The judge asked when she got married. She replied that she got married at the age of seventeen and has a son who is now eight years old. I work in a cigarette factory to support myself and also have to raise my child. My husband neglects the family and abuses me instead. There are quarrels several times a month. On the 26th of December last year, my husband ordered his younger brothers to beat me, so I was unwilling to submit and left on the next day (the 27th). The next day (the 28th), I went to the Prosecutor's Office of the court to request an examination of my injuries. Later, I was summoned, but only my father-in-law, Zhang Maomao, appeared in court, and my younger brothers-in-law did not. I was advised to reconcile in court, to return to my husband's house, and my husband's family was instructed not to abuse me. But the whole family treated me like a prisoner, monitoring my actions, not allowing me to cross the line. Living like this is meaningless, and my husband is unable to speak or move his legs. I am determined to divorce, etc. The judge ordered the defendant, Zhang Nian, to the stand. Due to his unclear speech, the defendant's father, Zhang Maomao, spoke on his behalf, stating that his son, Zhang Nian, is 29 years old, a native of Shanghai, and lives at 217 Shiqiaotou, Yangjiadu, Pudong. He used to work as a boatman. In October of last year, my son sailed his boat to Hangzhou to load stones and went to the mountains to play, when he was suddenly struck by a divine wind, injuring his hands and feet. As a result, one hand and one foot cannot move, and he cannot speak clearly. If he wants to speak, it is also unclear. The judge asked the defendant, "Now that the plaintiff is requesting a divorce, what do you think?" The defendant shook his head repeatedly, indicating that he did not want to. His father replied on his behalf, "My son does not want a divorce." The judge asked if your son has always been well-behaved. He replied, "Very well-behaved." The judge asked why he beat her. He replied, "He didn't beat her. Because last year she said she was working at a cigarette company in Tangjiawan, Ximen, but the company was already closed, so I questioned her. Unexpectedly, she filed a lawsuit." The judge ordered the plaintiff to withdraw from the court and questioned her separately. Then he said to the defendants, "Since your son is now ill, why not grant her wish and allow the divorce? After the defendant recovers, he can remarry. Even if you don't divorce, I'm afraid there will be no good outcome in the future." Zhang Maomao replied, "My son is determined not to divorce." The judge summoned the plaintiff to the stand again. At this point, Zhang Maomao again stated that my daughter-in-law had relations with Yao Hong, and I reported it to the Prosecutor's Office, and they were ordered to break up. The judge said to both parties, "The defendant's illness, one says he was injured by the wind, and the other says it was caused by visiting prostitutes. But what is the truth should be diagnosed and identified by a doctor to clarify the truth. The diagnostic costs should be borne equally by both parties." The plaintiff said, "I have no money to pay." The judge said, "Now the defendant is ordered to pay ten yuan for the doctor's diagnostic fee, and to wait for a scheduled visit to the designated hospital for identification before the case is heard again." Then the court adjourned.</p>
<h3>Pudong Middle School Teacher Wrote Absurd Slogans</h3>
<p>▲Dai Minggao Arrested by Police</p>
<p>▲Escorted to the High Court for Trial</p>
<p>Dai Minggao, a teacher at Pudong Middle School, wrote absurd slogans on electric poles and walls in the factory area of Caojiadu, in Western Shanghai. He was arrested by patrolling police and taken to the Sixth District Police Station, then presented to the Public Security Bureau. He made a false confession during interrogation, but the draft of the slogans was found on his person. He was immediately transferred to the local court for interrogation and detention. Because the first trial of the counter-revolutionary case is under the jurisdiction of the High Court, the local court yesterday assigned a bailiff to escort him to the Suzhou High Court for review this morning.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Vehicle Accident Case</h3>
<p>▲Fewer Deaths Last Month</p>
<p>In February, there were a total of 769 vehicle accidents in the Public Concession, and the number of deaths was greatly reduced compared to the past, with only three deaths. This was unprecedented since 1925. There were sixteen days in that month without a single death. Two of the three deaths were caused by their own carelessness. In that month, a total of 254 people were injured, 134 of whom were also caused by their own carelessness. In the same month last year, there were a total of 662 accidents, 190 injuries, and 9 deaths. In January of this year, there were a total of 830 accidents, 331 injuries, and as many as 14 deaths.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Local Court Investigates the Truth of the Old West Gate House Collapse</h3>
<p>▲The Bureau of Public Works' Reply</p>
<p>Huang Fangji Construction Company was contracted to build a new house for Gu Fuji in Old West Gate. Suddenly, on January 26th of this year, the entire house collapsed. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works believed that the cause of the collapse was due to the contractor's negligence. Therefore, after the collapse, it immediately sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau, ordering Huang Fangji to be brought to justice. All the details were repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now heard that the Prosecutor's Office of the local court has summoned the contractor and supervisor. However, because their confessions differed, it was difficult to reach a conclusion. The Bureau of Public Works was asked to investigate the truth. After receiving the letter, the Bureau of Public Works immediately replied to the Prosecutor's Office. The original text of the letter is found and copied as follows: In reply to your letter, concerning the collapse of the new house in Old West Gate, which resulted in the death of many workers, and whether it was due to the contractor's improper construction or the supervisor's negligence in supervision. Upon investigation, the construction permit for the aforementioned new house was issued by this Bureau on December 19th of the eighteenth year of the Republic. Later, according to craftsman Huang Fangji, he came to the Bureau on January 10th of the nineteenth year of the Republic to request the dispatch of personnel to inspect the steel bars before pouring the cement. However, due to the rush to complete the building on time, the wooden molds and supports were completely removed on the 26th of the same month before the cement had hardened, resulting in the inability to bear the load and the sudden collapse of the entire new house. According to cement construction, it should go through four procedures from the start of construction to completion, namely (1) arranging wooden molds and supports, (2) selecting steel bars, (3) pouring cement, and (4) dismantling wooden molds and supports on time. The dismantling of these wooden molds and supports must be based on whether the cement has solidified. The solidification of cement depends on the warmth of the weather. If the weather is warm, it can solidify after three weeks. If the weather is cold, it takes six or seven weeks to solidify. Based on this, after the first three procedures of cement engineering are completed, the wooden molds and supports must be dismantled at the appropriate time to be correct. Now, the collapse of the new house in Old West Gate is undoubtedly due to the failure to fully comply with the engineering procedures. As for the responsibilities between the contractor and the supervisor, and whether their responsibilities can be clearly divided, it is not within the scope of engineering, and this Bureau cannot speculate. The above is in response to your letter. Please investigate. To the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office of Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Meningitis Found in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Meningitis has recently been found in the Fahua Town area of Western Shanghai, and the situation is very serious. Every patient dies before being treated, with dozens of cases per day. Most of them are children under ten years old, and it is easily transmitted. It has recently spread to various villages.

<h3>Lejia Cafe and Others' Requests for Resumption of Business Denied</h3>
<p>The cafes and wine shops in various places in Shanghai were previously strictly prohibited from opening according to the Municipal Government's order. Now that these cafes and wine shops, feeling that their livelihoods are at stake if they shut down, have submitted petitions to the Municipal Government requesting permission to operate. Yesterday, the Municipal Government issued an instruction: The submission is noted. The cafes and wine shops are dens of filth and corrupt morals, and citizens and district party headquarters have repeatedly petitioned for their closure. After this government dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate and confirmed the facts, the Public Security Bureau was ordered to investigate and ban them. Previously, Russian expatriate wine shop operators petitioned for a delay in the ban and mistakenly claimed that the treatment of those operated by the Japanese should not be the same. This has been clearly instructed and the Public Security Bureau has been strictly ordered to investigate and ban all cases. It is imperative to improve public morals. Your cafes and wine shops must comply with the order to cease operations and find legitimate businesses. Do not obstruct under false pretenses, or you will be severely investigated. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to investigate the addresses and ban them all, you must comply. This instruction.</p>

<h3>Extradition of Gangster Jiang Jigui Approved in the Case of the Murder of a Patrol Officer</h3>
<p>Zhang Shiqin, patrol officer of the Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau, reported to the French Police the other day that Wu Yanyao, patrol officer of the Fourth Precinct, was patrolling outside on the morning of January 3rd when he encountered five gangsters. When he went to search them, he was shot and killed by the gangsters. Later, one of the gangsters, Liu Zilin, was arrested and confessed that the gun was given to him by the old man, Jiang Jigui. An immediate search was conducted at Jiang's house, and only nineteen lead bullets were found, which matched the serial number of the lead bullets that killed Officer Wu. However, Jiang had fled upon hearing the news. It was not until now that it was discovered that Jiang was hiding in the house at 156 Dongxinqiao Street. Therefore, a request was made for cooperation in the arrest. The head constable approved the request and immediately ordered the patrolmen to cooperate and go to the location to arrest Jiang. Yesterday, he was escorted to the French Concession Court for interrogation. First, the visiting patrol officer, Zhang Shiqin, stated the case and requested permission to extradite him to the case for interrogation. When Jiang Jigui was questioned, he confessed that he was a foreman in the Gongda Yarn Factory in Zhabei, that he did not know Liu Zilin, who had already been arrested, and that he was not his apprentice. He gave evasive answers to the rest of the questions. After discussions between the Chinese and Western officials, the court ruled that the defendant Jiang Jigui was allowed to be taken away by the patrolmen, limited to one month. After the expiration of the period, he must be returned.</p>

<h3>Preparations for the New York University Alumni Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai New York University Alumni Association held its first preparatory meeting at 5:30 PM on March 3rd at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund in the Public Concession. Although it was raining heavily at the time, the attendance was very enthusiastic. This shows the vibrant spirit of the association, and its glorious future can be predicted. After the meeting and discussion, three temporary officers were elected: Wang Ruiren as president, Wang Yaotang as secretary, and Wang Xinkang as treasurer. These three were publicly elected as members of the association's constitution drafting committee. However, the date of the next official meeting cannot be determined because the addresses of many alumni are not clear. Fearing that they will not be able to notify each individual, they plan to publish a notice in the newspaper before the meeting so that all alumni in Shanghai can attend and work together to achieve this goal. The association now has a communication address at Room 418, No. 20 Museum Road, and hopes that alumni in Shanghai will send their detailed addresses there to Wang Ruiren for registration and communication.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Fare Increase Problem</h3>
<p>▲Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Orders Report on Two-Month Situation</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Company's Xujiahui to Airport line in Western Shanghai originally set the full-route fare at 75 cents. Following the British Public Bus Company's reliance on building roads beyond the boundaries (namely, the Hongqiao Road), it also put buses on the road, reducing fares and competing for business. The Shanghai South Company had to reduce prices accordingly to attract passengers and maintain the route. The final fare was 90 branches per passenger, resulting in considerable losses in operations. Later, the British company also voluntarily cooperated with the company due to unsustainable losses. The Shanghai South fare was set at 30 cents per passenger. Recently, because this amount is still a large difference from the original fare of 75 cents and is not enough to compensate for the losses, it is planned to slightly increase the fare, starting from 5 cents up to 40 cents, and submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities for review. The Bureau approved the order to report the total length of the section and the daily number of trips, number of passengers, total income, and expenses in detail for the past two months, and then review it.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Renjili Householders' Association in Southern Shanghai</h3>
<p>The entire number of tenants of Renjili, on Huacheng Road in the French Concession, formed the Renjili Householders' Association because the Renji Charity Hall leased the public property to the Shenyu Company, forcing them to move out. The Association held its inaugural meeting at the French Concession Business Association at 7 PM yesterday. Li Guoliang was the chairman, Yu Jingyu was the secretary, and party representatives Wu Zhen, Li Zhuang, and Yu Jingyu attended. As a result of the election, Ju Youshan, Li Guoliang, Zhongnan Company, Xia Yuankang, Xu Zhaowen, Chen Zhangqing, and Xu Achang were elected as executive committee members, and Luo Runde, Sun Maosheng, and Fang Chunsheng were elected as alternates.

<h3>Robbers Visit Baohua Lower Temple</h3>
<p>▲Monk and Thief Are Acquaintances</p>
<p>▲After Finding, Handed Over to Police</p>
<p>In the Xiaoshadu Lime Kiln area of Western Shanghai, there is a temple named Baohua Lower Temple, a small house with two idols. It is neither solemn nor pure, because opportunistic monks use it as a business organization. The resident monk in the temple, Nengda, is from Jiangbei. The temple employs two incense servants, Xu Xiaoerzi and Zhang Bifa, who are either the monk's nephews or nephews-in-law. The family lives in the temple and their living conditions are very difficult as they have to pay rent every month. This kind of nascent temple is ubiquitous in Shanghai. If expenses cannot be met, some even pawn copper statues of Buddha in pawnshops, while others are sued by landlords for unpaid rent and have their properties sealed and auctioned. One would think that such places can be slept in at night without closing the doors. Unexpectedly, the Baohua Lower Temple was robbed by seven thugs wielding knives on the night before last at around 11 PM. They recklessly looted, but there was really nothing of value inside except for the idols. They knocked on Nengda and searched, obtaining five yuan used to buy rice, and stripped off the clothes from the incense burner. However, one of the thieves, Zhou Dianchen, was an acquaintance. Zhou claimed that he did not know the monk, but the monks knew who he was. After finding him, they took him to the Sixth District Police Station. Because the case was related to robbery, it was transferred to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ding Xiaomei Severes Relationship with Liu Fengxiang</h3>
<p>Ding Xiaomei, a woman from Chuansha, recently filed a request for divorce from Liu Fengxiang in the local court. Her statement stated that she is 26 years old this year. In the past, at the age of 18, she lived with the defendant Liu Fengxiang and had two children, who both died young. But Liu Fengxiang eats opium and does not work, ordering me to do improper things. I refuse, and he often quarrels with me. Now my parents do not recognize me as their daughter, so I have no home to return to. I now rent a house in the French Concession. The defendant does not care about my life, so I have to sever my relationship with him. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhao opened a court session and interrogated the plaintiff about the previous situation. The defendant Liu Fengxiang confessed that he is 35 years old, from Liuhou, and lives at 375 Ruifuli, Caishi Street, French Concession. He used to be a Chinese constable, but after retiring, he opened a Yanzike, which is now closed. The judge asked if you are formally married. He replied that although we have not been married, we do have Xiaobazi and Gengtie. The judge said, "So you are a concubine." He replied, "I have lived with her for eight years. She once ran away with my companion when she was 20, but was soon found. Now she has another lover, so she wants to break up with me, but I have lived with her for many years and have suffered losses. I am extremely opposed to breaking up." At this point, the plaintiff interrupted and said that the furniture, etc., in the house in Ruifuli, has been detained by the second landlord for arrears in rent. The judge said, "This is another matter." He then attempted reconciliation, ordering the plaintiff Ding Xiaomei to compensate the defendant 60 yuan. The defendant nodded in agreement, and a reconciliation was reached. The judge then drafted a reconciliation record, ordered both parties to sign it, and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>A Case of One Woman and Four Husbands Adjudicated</h3>
<p>▲The Woman Zhou Handed Over to Second Husband to Take Back</p>
<p>▲Third Husband Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment</p>
<p>The case of Zhou, a woman from Huzhou who married four husbands in succession, and who was reported by her second husband, Shi Chunfa, for fleeing to Baoshan County, resulting in her arrest and investigation, was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Wu County Magistrate dispatched Judge Zhang to open a court hearing. The plaintiff, Shi Chunfa, testified that Zhou's escape was due to being seduced and hidden by Yao Wei, who then sold her to a Han surname in Pan Dian as his wife, requesting investigation and prosecution. Zhou testified that she went from Huzhou to Shanghai, met Yao Wei, and was seduced by him in every way, having relations with him for more than ten days. Later, due to lack of funds, he sold her to the Han surname as his wife, with Yao obtaining 220 silver dollars for the sale. Yao Wei testified that he used to be a primary school teacher but had been unemployed for a long time, and that Zhou came with him willingly. He gave evasive answers to other questions. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Zhang determined that the defendant Yao Wei was guilty of fraudulent acquisition of property and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment as a warning. Zhou was handed over to Shi Chunfa to take back.</p>
<h3>Afforestation Campaign Preparations Completed</h3>
<p>▲City Government at Damuqiao Head</p>
<p>▲County Government at Qianliang Temple</p>
<p>The progress of the tree planting ceremony and afforestation campaign promotion week in the city has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the preparatory committee held a photographer meeting and the third preparatory meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau on the 3rd and 4th of this month. All the necessary preparations have been largely finalized. The following are some of the important matters:</p>
<p>▲Distribution of Seedlings: The afforestation promotion week planned by the committee aims to provide high-quality seedlings to the public free of charge for their own use. The Municipal Garden Farm run by the Social Affairs Bureau has been providing a large number of seedlings, with more than 30 different types and a quantity exceeding 15,000 plants. A public announcement will be published immediately. Those who need seedlings can submit documents to register with the Social Affairs Bureau. Dozens of applications have already been received. It is said that the distribution is scheduled to take place once on the anniversary of the death of the Premier, to facilitate planting.</p>
<p>▲Party Members' Afforestation: The tree planting ceremony site designated by the municipal government is at the head of Damuqiao. The Municipal Party Department originally intended to join in, but as the number of seedlings prepared there was limited and insufficient for the use of all party members, the Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the committee to find another location for a large-scale event. Currently, the square around the Pingle Housing in Zhabei Quanjia'an Road lacks trees. The location is convenient for transportation, easy to gather, and in line with the spirit of commemorating the Premier's efforts to benefit the common people.</p>
<p>▲Increased Vehicles: The tree planting site is far away at Damuqiao Road from the Municipal Government. There are existing Chinese-owned and French Concession buses that can be used, but fearing that the personnel will be crowded at that time, the Public Works Bureau has sent a letter to the bus companies to prepare special vehicles. The Chinese side has already allocated a number of vehicles to park at Laoximen from 1:00 PM on the 12th for transportation.</p>
<p>Publication of Special Issue: In the past two years, a special tree planting issue has been published in the Municipal Weekly of the Shen and Xin newspapers. This year, because the publication has been suspended, the Shen and Xin newspapers have also found it inconvenient to print due to space constraints. The committee has entrusted others to print 300,000 copies, which will still be distributed to the public through the Shen and Xin newspapers for reference and commemoration.</p>
<p>▲Additional Lyrics: A tree planting song was composed by composer Wu Yan Yin in previous years, with profound meaning. Children in the city's schools can sing it off the cuff, but the lyrics are limited to tree planting ceremonies and roadside trees, and the meaning of the afforestation promotion week has not been included. This year, the Education Bureau has added a song about afforestation, which will make children understand the true meaning of afforestation.</p>
<p>▲County Government Preparations: The county government has decided to hold a tree planting ceremony on the 12th of today in conjunction with the county party department. The Qianliang Temple area has been determined as the tree planting site, and Peng Liren, the head of the second district, has been appointed to prepare everything. All the necessary expenses have also been issued. Yesterday, instructions were issued to the bureaus and district chiefs to proceed to the assembly before 1:00 PM this afternoon to hold the ceremony in commemoration.</p>
<h3>New City Government Design Revealed</h3>
<p>The selection of designs by the Municipal Central District Construction Committee has been reported previously. It is now learned that the names of the winners selected have been submitted to the mayor for approval and announced. The winners are: first place, Zhao Shen, Zhao Sunxi Ming, prize money of 3,000 yuan; second place, Wu Zhenying, prize money of 1,500 yuan; third place, Fei Libo, prize money of 750 yuan; supplementary prizes, Xu Xintang, Shi Changgang, Li Pei, two people, 300 yuan each; Yang Xiliu, Shen Liyuan, Zhu Baochu, three people, 100 yuan each. The prize money to be received by the above winners must be collected from the committee inside the Municipal Works Bureau of Maojia Long in Nanshi before the end of this month. The unselected designs and the previously paid deposits must also be collected from the committee before the end of April, with receipts and the received maps. Overdue will not be returned.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Land Bureau Delineates the Boundary Between Zhudi Town, City and County</h3>
<p>The old boundary between the municipal Wenchang Temple site in Zhudi Town, Pusong District, western Shanghai, and the Jiading County Wenchang Temple has now been submerged. The Municipal Land Bureau specially dispatched personnel the other day to meet with representatives from Jiading County and municipal committee members to survey the site and found that there was a Wenchang Temple wall boundary in Jiading County at the southern end of the municipal Wenchang Temple site. The south end of the wall is a road that is the boundary between the city and county, and the wall boundary has become a straight line, then the straight line drawn north from the wall boundary can be used as the boundary line between the city and county. Boundary stones were immediately erected, and drawings were made to delineate the line. The municipal Wenchang Temple site will be used as a road for the benefit of pedestrians. The old branches, willows, and thin bamboo fences within the boundary will be removed by Jiading County. It is heard that the bureau has submitted the handling situation to the municipal government for record.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Immigrates to the Northeast</h3>
<p>▲Municipal Government Orders Bureau to Assist</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province is currently handling the immigration of people to the Northeast. At the end of April, it will send settlers to Shanghai to wait for ships to depart. When the people arrive at the port, there must be temporary lodging places, and how to transport them must also be planned in advance. Therefore, the other day, the Municipal Government of this city was consulted and ordered to assist. It is heard that the Municipal Government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to cooperate with the committee sent by Zhejiang Province to plan everything and provide assistance when the people arrive.</p>
<h3>Li Jinglun Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from Beijing</h3>
<p>Li Jinglun, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai by car from Beijing yesterday. Chen Shiguang, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to the station to greet him. It is heard that Li came to Shanghai this time to take his wife to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Guo Chengen's Speech</h3>
<p>▲Purchase Prices Have Files</p>
<p>▲Reasons for Gun Barrel Bursting</p>
<p>After the head of the Shanghai Arsenal, Guo Chengen, had a problem with the steel plant over the purchase of materials, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency approached Guo yesterday. According to Guo, "Our factory has an organization of a purchasing committee, and even the smallest item used in the factory, such as a piece of paper or a rope, must be decided by the committee before being purchased through bidding. As for the high price of the steel bought from the Shanghai Steel Plant, whether it exceeds foreign goods or not, there are files to check. I am not an outsider, nor do I like to use foreign goods, so I don't need to argue. Later, the plant issued a declaration saying that I had arranged for workers to be placed in the arsenal, but in fact there was a big misunderstanding of my meaning. Also, I only learned about the bursting of the gun barrel after receiving instructions from my superiors. The reason for the bursting may be due to improper manufacturing, or the user's infrequent wiping, which led to the rusting and bursting of the gun barrel, but the quality of the steel's coating cannot be said to be irrelevant. Our factory is currently investigating."</p>
<h3>Raw Silk Asks to be Exempted from Public Weighing and Inspection</h3>
<p>The Silk Industry Associations of Guandong, Shandong, Hubei, and Sichuan believe that the implementation of public weighing and baking inspection for exported raw silk has many obstacles. They convened a joint meeting on the first of this month and elected representatives to go to the ministries and bureaus to continue to petition, requesting that the implementation be waived. This newspaper has reported on this matter. It is now learned that the silk merchants of the four provinces strongly oppose the baking inspection of raw silk. The reason for the difficulty in implementation is that the yellow and gray silks produced in Guanshan Dong and other provinces are all raw silks, made purely by hand, which are different in nature from machine-made silk. Once baked and inspected by electric machines, the color of the silk will change and the silk threads will easily break, which is not suitable for the use of fast machines in European and American silk weaving factories, affecting European sales and making it difficult to implement. Moreover, the foreign firm has not yet recognized the inspection fee, that is, the baked sample silk, the foreign banks also firmly refuse to accept it and must be returned to the owner, the Chinese merchant loses a lot, so the will to oppose is very firm, only to achieve the purpose of cancellation will stop. The drafters of the petition submitted last time, Cai Renbao, Zhao Mingfu, Zhong Xusheng, Deng Baxu, etc., have drafted the petition, which has been passed by the public, and handed it to the petition representatives Cai Renbao, Tan Zhensheng (Guanshan Dong) Ling Zhifang, Zheng Yushu (Sichuan) Lu Lisheng, Liu Shanfu (Hubei), etc. Yesterday afternoon, they went to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau to visit Director Zou, handed over the petition and stated the public opinion of the four provinces' silk merchants and the purpose of the request. Director Zou agreed to forward it to Minister Kong for instructions, and the six representatives will also go to Beijing to continue to petition the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and asked to be considerate of the merchants' difficulties and exempt exported raw silk from public weighing and inspection.</p>
<h3>Paige Talks About the Future of Society</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for Mr. Paige, an American expert on social issues, to speak at the Sichuan Road YMCA. The topic was the future of society, chaired by Cao Yunxiang, translated by Chen Liting, and noted in the national phonetic alphabet by Yang Bingxun. He said that human nature has both good and evil, and it is completely determined by the individual's aspirations. Evil is selfishness, and good is creation. Selfish people are only for themselves, and creative people are for society. Yuan Shikai wanted to be emperor himself, which is selfishness. Mr. Sun Yat-sen gave up his position for the country and became a good model of patriotism and love for the people, which is creation. Therefore, the future of society is completely determined by our individual choices.</p>
<h3>What Was Heard After the Election of Foreign Directors of the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>▲British New Director Gives Up a Seat</p>
<p>▲American Borden Succeeds</p>
<p>The Da Wanbao newspaper reports that after the results of the election of foreign directors of the Public Works Department were announced last night, only one American was elected, while six were British. Because it does not conform to the usual practice, it is heard that one of the British new directors will resign so that the American Borden, who received the next highest number of votes, can succeed, which will still conform to the ratio of five British and two Americans. However, no one has yet indicated who will resign. According to the number of votes cast in the two-day election period, a total of 1,350 votes, plus 27 invalid votes, has reached 50% of the total number of voters, which can be said to be a rare occurrence in the past. As for the results, in addition to the fact that the American only had one person elected because there were three candidates and the votes were divided, it is also a marvel that the British outgoing president, Arnold, actually lost the election due to a lack of 21 votes. Of the nine elected, in addition to Fukushima, MacNaughten, Peel, and Shiba, who were old directors who were re-elected, the remaining five were all new members. Borden, the American who proposed the paving of the road, is also a new member.</p>
<p>The Zilin Newspaper reports that judging from the results of this election of directors of the Public Works Department, it seems that voters attach great importance to the fact that the measures of the Public Works Department should be sought to be public. Most of the elected people agree to the public. Arnold unfortunately did not have time to express his opinion on this issue due to his busy schedule, which led to his loss of position. Marseille firmly opposed this proposal, which also led to his loss of election.</p>
<p>The Japanese candidates Fukushima and Saito, who were re-elected as directors of the Public Works Department of the International Settlement in this session, received the most votes. Therefore, A Duan, Mi Li, and Lin Xiongji (all leaders of Japanese expatriate groups) initiated a celebration banquet at the Japanese Club tomorrow night (the 7th) to celebrate the election of the elected and to comfort the staff of the general branch. One party discussed expanding the rights of Japanese citizens, and it is heard that a number of proposals will be submitted to the board of directors for adoption and implementation.</p>
<h3>The Red Cross Rehabilitation Office Handed Over to the Standing Committee to Receive</h3>
<p>The China Red Cross Rehabilitation Office handed over the affairs, items, affiliated disaster relief orphanages, etc. to the Standing Committee for acceptance on March 2. The official letter of the Rehabilitation Office handing over the office is recorded as follows: In order to transfer the executive power of the Rehabilitation Office, it is noted that since the establishment of the Rehabilitation Office last year, it has raised 250,000 yuan of Pagoda Donations, assisted in the emergency relief of Shaanxi, Gansu, Henan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other places, and rescued women, children, disaster-stricken orphans and refugees. Fortunately, relying on everyone's efforts, it has also exhausted its strength. The fifth Rehabilitation Committee decided on February 16 to publicly recommend the accounting committee and accountants of the Economic Committee to review the disaster relief list and end the disaster relief affairs. A resolution was also approved by your meeting some days ago to transfer the executive power of the Rehabilitation Office, as well as silver coins, items, staff, and all the disaster relief orphanages, to your association for acceptance. Now, all the items and various disaster relief orphanages of this office have been listed separately and sent for verification and acceptance. The disaster relief voucher check books, staff books, disaster relief orphanages books, recent foreign donation letters books, savings passbooks, ticket stub receipt books, file books, and printed matter books are attached for point-by-point delivery, and receipts are issued.</p>
<h3>Jishenghui Receives Qishan County Report on Recent Disaster Situation</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association yesterday received a report from Qishan County, Shaanxi Province, stating that Qiyi has suffered from poor harvests since the summer of 1928. Up to last autumn, the land has been barren for three years, and the land is red. Nine out of ten houses are empty. The original population was more than 208,000, more than 73,000 died of starvation, and more than 31,200 people fled. The number of deaths from epidemics is countless. Last winter, more than 100 villages, including Caijia Town, were devastated by bandits, and the murder was full of fields. At that time, it was extremely cold and snowy, and hundreds of men, women, old people, young children, and infants were killed. Hundreds of livestock were lost, and the value of the losses was tens of millions of silver. The county belongs to the entire territory of the six districts, which have been occupied by bandits and驻军need military expenses. When recovering the people are either killed by bandits or starved to death. Although orphanages have been established for poor children, they have collected thousands of hundreds of people, but there are fewer 款 funds and more people, and cooking smoke is almost cut off. Please allocate assistance to save the remaining lives. The association has distributed emergency relief in more than ten counties in Shaanxi, including Chang'an, Xianyang, Wugong, and Qishan, or distributed wheat seeds. Disaster relief refugee camps have been established in Chang'an, Xianyang, Wugong, Qishan, etc., collecting hundreds to more than 2,000 people. In this case, when there are disasters everywhere, rescue efforts are endless, and without rescue, there is no way to save the dead, but where does the huge fund come from for rescue? It has fallen into a situation where it cannot be maintained, and it is very difficult to advance or retreat.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Trade Unions Return to Shanghai after Filing a Petition</h3>
<p>Zhang Yaoming, Lu Jingshi, Xu Shaochuan, Ye Gonglun and others, representatives of various trade unions in this city, went to Beijing to file a petition with the Central Government to establish a general trade union. It is now learned that after the representatives arrived in Beijing, they went to the Central Training Department to meet with Minister Dai. Shi Weihuan, the secretary of the department, received them and agreed to forward the petition after Minister Dai returned to Beijing. They then filed a petition with the Central Third Plenary Session, met with Secretary-General Chen Lifu, accepted the petition, and said that the presidium had handed it over to the Central Training Department for research, and a definite reply would be given in the shortest possible time. It is heard that the representatives have returned to Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Injured and Killed by Car</h3>
<p>▲His Wife Cried Out "I Don't Want Money"</p>
<p>▲Just Compensate Her With a Living Person</p>
<p>Li, a native of Jiangbei, made a living by pulling rickshaws. On the 3rd of this month, he was pulling an empty car on Jingsi Road, walking slowly. Suddenly, he heard someone calling for his car, so Li crossed the road. A car driven by Zhu Bingyuan, a native of Zhejiang, and his wife drove by. The driver, Chen Shanran, was unable to avoid it and knocked Li down. The right wheel of the rickshaw was damaged, and Li was also injured. He was sent to the hospital for treatment by the police, but it was ineffective. The next morning at 7:00 AM, he died of his injuries. The body was taken to the Feilun Road autopsy room by the police. Yesterday, Judge Ge of the Provisional Court visited the office to determine the cause of death. He took the bench and gathered witnesses to inquire about the details. He ruled that Li was not careful and ordered Li's wife, Li Yang, to sign for the body, coffin, and burial. He instructed the car owner to give appropriate compensation. The woman cried out, "I don't want money, I want a living person!" She said that her husband had been pulling a car for eight years and depended on it for a living. Judge Ge repeatedly persuaded her, but she could not be reasoned with, so he instructed the car owner to give appropriate compensation. The car owner could only agree and retreated.</p>
<h3>Patrolman Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Ding Minggao, a native of Jiangbei, was driving truck number 16684 on Huade Road, heading east, at about 1:00 PM yesterday. At that time, Zhao Zhibin, a patrolman from the fourth precinct of the fifth district, was riding his bicycle towards him and was unable to avoid it, causing Zhao police and the car to crash into the curb, injuring his head. A Chinese policeman from number 554 arrived and sent the injured to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. He copied down the truck number and brought the driver, Ding Minggao, to the Huishan Police Station. He reported to the head of the police and detained him for investigation.</p>

<h3>Tram Derailment in West Gate</h3>
<p>At about 12:30 PM yesterday, a tram number 2, line 4, operated by the Huashang Electric Company (driver number 47) was heading from Gaochang Temple to West Gate. When it arrived at the end station in West Gate to turn around and drive into the branch road, it accidentally derailed. Fortunately, the track was not damaged, but traffic was temporarily blocked. The ticketing room in West Gate immediately reported to the company by phone. Track workers were immediately dispatched to put the derailed vehicle back on the track. The round-trip and line 2 trams were all blocked for about an hour before traffic was restored.</p>
<h3>Why are There So Many People Committing Suicide?</h3>
<p>▲Suspicious Husband Staying Out All Night. Yu Zihua, a native of Ningbo, lives at No. 29 Ren'anli, Macleek Road. He used to be a comprador on the Japanese ship Shengjing Maru. Recently, he took leave to recuperate at home. The other day, he went to the Tongshang Hotel on Fuzhou Road to discuss with a friend about seeking a position as the main comprador on another ship. It was late, so he stayed in the hotel and did not return. When he returned home yesterday morning, Yu's wife, Yuan (20 years old), thought it was suspicious that her husband stayed out all night, and they had a quarrel. Yu insisted that he was innocent and complained a few words. Yuan suddenly had a momentary idea and secretly bought half a yuan of opium paste and swallowed it. It was not until 11:00 AM that they realized it and immediately sent her to Tongren Hospital. It is heard that the poisoning was mild and there was no danger to her life.</p>
<p>▲Frustration from Share Split Leads to Suicide Attempt. Qian Hongzhang, a native of Ningbo, 20 years old, used to work for the Samsung Gramophone Company on Fuzhou Road. He lives at No. 341 Jingyanli, Yuanfang Road, Hongkou. Recently, the company wanted to split his shares, so Qian became depressed and secretly swallowed opium yesterday afternoon, trying to end his life. It was not until 7:45 PM that someone noticed it and sent him to Renji Hospital. It is heard that the poisoning was severe and there may be a danger to his life.</p>
<h3>Unfinished Building's Brick Wall and Fence Collapses, Causing Disaster</h3>
<p>▲No Injuries, Only Damaged Glass Windows</p>
<p>▲And Broken Power and Telephone Lines</p>
<p>The five-story Western-style building that is being newly built at the intersection of Fujian Road and Tianjin Road has not yet been completed. The contractor is said to be Yang Ruiji. Unexpectedly, at 30 minutes past noon the other day, the five-story brick wall and wooden scaffolding fence near Tianjin Road suddenly collapsed. At that time, there was a lot of noise nearby, and people ran away in droves. Fortunately, it was during the day, so no one was injured. However, the roofs and glass windows of the buildings adjacent to the new building at No. 188, No. 190, and No. 394 to No. 396 on the south side of Tianjin Road, and No. 187 to No. 190 on the east side of Zhili Road were damaged. The power and telephone lines were also broken. The police station in charge was notified and dispatched investigators to investigate.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Manure Collection Area</h3>
<p>▲Mo Baoquan has a Contract</p>
<p>▲Shandong Gang's Yang Chu Detained</p>
<p>The cleaning affairs of the Gaochang Temple area in Shanghai were contracted by a Mo surname merchant in the autumn of 1928. After the opening, it was blocked in the middle and stopped. In January of this year, Mo Baoquan was approved by the Finance, Social Affairs, Public Security, and Health Bureaus of the Special Municipal Government to issue a joint announcement to delineate the cleaning area. From Gaochang Temple area, east to the Huangpu Bund, south to the riverside pier, west to the Outer Rihui Bridge, north to the Machine Factory Street, turn to Hu Min Nan Zha Road, Xietu Road, to Danning Bridge. If there are hooligans and ruffians who dare to obstruct the donation of money, the contractor shall report to the public security sub-bureau in charge and strictly detain and punish them. The contractor has now set up a place to start business and has sent personnel to negotiate with the Farmers Association. However, Yang and Chu from the Shandong gang have been obstructing it, resulting in the dragging away of manure trucks and other incidents. Therefore, Mo reported to the public security sub-bureau in charge, and Yang has been arrested and sent to the Third Section of the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Chen Chunsheng's Rice Boat Capsizes in the River</h3>
<p>The Nanshi Licheng Rice Company purchased 600 bags of foreign rice from the Shengze Xiangji the other day and entrusted the company to hire a boat to transport it. Licheng hired Chen Chunsheng and Xing Asan's two boats for transportation. Yesterday morning, the two boats set off from Shanghai and sailed near Longhua. Because the wind was very strong and the cargo was quite heavy, they dropped anchor there and stopped. Chen's boat was in the front, and was steering to turn towards the beach, but the wind and waves were surging, and the boat was surging with the waves, making it difficult to anchor. Suddenly, a foreign-owned pleasure yacht sped by and was unable to avoid it, hitting Chen's boat head-on, breaking it instantly. The tide poured in, and Chen and his partner who were standing at the bow to drop anchor were knocked into the river. Xing's boat was behind and saw it and rushed to rescue them, but the tide was rapid and it was difficult to rescue them. Fortunately, another boat rescued them. When Chen was hit, the boat sped off. Seeing Chen's boat gradually sinking, it drove back and dragged Chen's boat to the beach. However, 40 to 50 bags of the cargo on the deck were knocked away, and all the cargo in the cabin was wet. Chen's boat was carrying 300 bags, and it is heard that the cargo had water insurance. Licheng immediately went to the scene of the accident with the company to investigate, so that they could negotiate with the boat to compensate for the losses. However, the rice cannot be stored for long after being wetted, and it has been sold to a sugar workshop for only 5-6 silver dollars per tan. The estimated loss is huge. It is heard that the boat is unwilling to pay compensation and is instead negotiating with Chen's boat, demanding repairs for the damaged bow. It is unknown how it will be resolved.</p>
<h3>Five Indians Caused Trouble While Intoxicated</h3>
<p>▲Jiufu Company's Glass Windows Destroyed</p>
<p>At around 3:30 AM yesterday, five Indians smashed the glass windows of the Jiufu Company at the corner of Park Road and Buck Road. They were discovered by the police on duty and taken to the Xinzha Police Station. They were all intoxicated trouble makers. The police transferred the five Indians and the iron rulers and wooden sticks they were carrying to the British Police Court for investigation. It is heard that the damaged glass windows and other items were worth about 800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Robbery on North Suzhou Road</h3>
<p>At 7:30 PM last night, seven robbers invaded No. 1089 North Suzhou Road, each holding a pistol, and threatened them not to make a sound. It is estimated that gold ornaments and cash worth more than 1,510 yuan were robbed and escaped.</p>
<h3>Five Robbers Captured on North Xizang Road</h3>
<p>At 10:00 AM the other day, detectives Fang Zhixin, Tao Rubi, Ma Zhongrong, and Liu Longchao of the Xinzha Police Station rushed to No. 105 North Xizang Road, No. 318 Meibaige Road, and Tangjiaqiao in Zhabei to capture five robbers: Hong Weiyou, Wu Asan, Jiang Jinfa (also known as Miao Lin), Wang Wansheng, and Luo Zhensheng, all natives of Jiangbei. They were sent to the Provisional Court yesterday morning. Judge Sun questioned them once, but because the police still needed to investigate, he ordered them all to be detained for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday said that it would be cloudy and cold, with rain or snow in the Yangtze River basin, and strong northwest to northeast winds along the coast of the country. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 43.5 and the lowest was 39.2. On the same day last year, the highest was 53.4 and the lowest was 26.6.</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>▲ Miss A – I will not marry someone I do not love.</p>
<p>Miss B – What if a millionaire asks for your hand in marriage? What would you do then?</p>
<p>Miss A – Then, of course, I would love him and, of course, I would marry him.</p>
<p>▲ Wife – Oh no, something terrible happened! The child swallowed the small shaving brush you use.</p>
<p>Husband – No need to make such a fuss. The brush was already shedding after six months of use. I was going to throw it away anyway.</p>
<p>▲ Daughter – Father, why are you so glum? Is it because Ah Bing is coming to marry me?</p>
<p>Father – No, it would be best if you left. I am just afraid he will send you back.</p>
<p>▲ Lawyer (defending a pickpocket) – When did you lose your valuables?</p>
<p>Victim – I don't know. Just ask your client since he also took my gold watch.</p>
<p>▲ Female Customer – You say this silk fabric is the most fashionable?</p>
<p>Silk Shop Assistant – Yes, it is the most fashionable.</p>

<h3>The Trust of the Philippine Press</h3>
<p>— Yan Wenchou</p>
<p>Since the Philippines came under American rule, the newspaper business has flourished. Currently, there are three languages that can be used in the Philippines. First, English. Students and young people who have received American education can all read and speak it. Second, Spanish. Due to over three hundred years of influence, Spanish is still used in government documents and upper-class social gatherings, and those who can speak Spanish are considered outstanding. Third, Tagalog. This is a type of native language. When Westerners entered the Philippines, they used the Spanish alphabet to spell out the native sounds. (There is another type of grammar. Generally, islanders can read newspapers after studying for four months.) Therefore, there are English newspapers, Spanish newspapers, and Tagalog newspapers. There are also newspapers that print in two languages.</p>
<p>Rooess, a Filipino of mixed Western descent, inherited a large fortune from his father. He uses his personal capital to operate three major daily newspapers. First, "The Tribune" (English newspaper). Second, "La Vanguardia" (Spanish newspaper). Third, "Taliba" (Tagalog newspaper). The three newspapers print 150,000 copies daily. "The Tribune" also publishes a Sunday supplement, which sells an additional 50,000 copies. There are also two weekly newspapers, each printing over 70,000 copies per week. His power to manipulate public opinion is unparalleled in the Philippines.</p>
<p>"The Tribune" hired Professor Romulo of the University of the Philippines as its chief editor. His monthly salary is 1,500 pesos (equivalent to nearly 2,100 yuan in Chinese silver currency at the current exchange rate). He is a famous orator in the Philippines. Last year, he led a debate team to the United States to promote independence. Therefore, in addition to being a university professor, he also holds this important position.</p>
<p>Filipinos with Western blood generally harbor anti-Chinese sentiments. Rooess is no exception. Therefore, the daily and weekly publications he publishes constantly discriminate against overseas Chinese. The increasingly strict immigration policies are the result of his newspapers' advocacy.

<h3>Interesting Anecdotes About Portraits</h3>
<p>— Chi Fo</p>
<p>I recently heard some interesting anecdotes about a painter of portraits at a friend's house. I am recording them here for your amusement. This gentleman is a young dandy. He once commissioned a painter to paint a small portrait. The painter had difficulty finding a suitable background and couldn't come up with an idea. Initially, he thought of having the subject rinse his mouth with stones and rest his head on a pillow while reclining among rocks and valleys, resembling a hermit in a secluded place. Although this seemed elegant, it was too reclusive. Then, he changed it to the subject holding a cane and wearing leather shoes, like a noble official in the political arena. However, this felt too ostentatious and vulgar. After much hesitation, he couldn't find the right idea. A guest suggested a painting of a spring outing with horses. The painting featured willows swaying gently, their tender green leaves shimmering, and peach blossoms blooming in vibrant red. In this scene of a spring meadow with shallow green grass, the subject was depicted riding a horse and cracking a whip, perfectly matching the ancient poem: "Galloping with the spring breeze, he sees all the Chang'an flowers in one night." The scene was both elegant and luxurious, and the subject was delighted with the painting. He carried it around to show his friends, who praised it. Later, someone laughed and said, "This is terrible! It's a direct insult!" Think about it: the horse, the willow, and the person – what do they mean when put together? Isn't it a 'horse-flowing person' (馬流人)?" Those who heard this burst into laughter. The term "horse-flowing person" is a vulgar expression for someone with a frivolous character. Nowadays, wealthy people often build humble cottages and ask famous scholars to write inscriptions for them, only to be ridiculed yet still feel honored. Are these all just like those dandies?</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Xuzhou</h3>
<p>— Yu Bai</p>
<p>The restaurant business in Xuzhou is thriving because Xuzhou is a crossroads. Troops are stationed there and change frequently, and officials are constantly coming and going. They always use restaurants as the only place for entertainment. Therefore, the owner of Yipinxiang Restaurant has earned forty to fifty thousand yuan in the past year or two, all thanks to the entertainment needs of the troops.</p>
<p>There are many troops stationed in Xuzhou, but the citizens are used to hardship and are not alarmed at all. The people of Xuzhou have become accustomed to it in the past ten years.</p>
<p>Eggs are very cheap in Xuzhou. One yuan can buy sixty eggs.</p>
<p>Xuzhou's pastries are very well made. The hawthorn cake is especially famous; it is exceptionally sweet, and the price is not high.</p>
<p>One yuan can buy three catties and twelve taels of lard in Xuzhou. In Nanjing, one yuan buys two catties and six taels, but it is even cheaper in Bengbu, where one yuan buys four catties.</p>
<p>One yuan can be exchanged for 450 copper coins in Xuzhou, but only double copper coins are used. In reality, double copper coins are a very small minority. The currency used in the streets is mostly 50-wen and 100-wen or 50-wen copper coin notes. The disorder of the currency system has reached its extreme. In addition, Tianjin banknotes, Jinan banknotes, and Shanghai banknotes are all commonly used.</p>
<p>During the last central bank closure, Xuzhou money changers took the opportunity to make a lot of money. Because transportation was cut off at the time, central Shanghai banknotes could not be cashed. Money changers bought them at 60-70% of their value and transferred them to Shanghai by sea to exchange them. In one transaction, they profited tens of thousands of yuan.</p>
<h3>Amusing Tales of Child Delivery</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The concept of having offspring is deeply rooted in the minds of the Chinese people. Even though current laws state that women also have the right to inherit property, the emphasis on having sons has not changed. Therefore, those who are infertile desperately desire to have children, much like people praying for rain during a drought. If human efforts are not enough, they resort to prayer and superstition, some of which are laughably absurd. Here are some observations I've made, offered as conversation starters.</p>
<p>▲ Child Delivery at the Doorstep: Sheng'an Lane in Xiaguan is not far from where I live. The master of a certain household there works for a certain government agency. Like the man in Qi who had a wife and a concubine, he is over forty years old but still has no children. He is always lamenting his lack of descendants, and his worries are visible. A friend, knowing his deep desire, prayed for him at a certain temple. After the prayer, he led the way with a lantern, followed by drums and music. Upon reaching the door, firecrackers were set off, and colorful auspicious words were mixed with the music. It was an extraordinary commotion, attracting a large crowd, and even the police came.</p>
<p>▲ Police Intervention: Setting off firecrackers is against the law, and superstitious acts are not tolerated in this day and age. Therefore, upon hearing the sound of firecrackers, the police rushed to question what was happening and reprimanded them for not reporting it in advance. Eventually, the head of the household explained and apologized, and the police left.</p>
<p>▲ Hanging Lanterns in the Bridal Chamber: After delivering the "child" to the door, they entered the house and went upstairs to the master's bedroom. Cymbals and gongs were played, and blessings were recited repeatedly. They also hung a paper lantern they had brought with them on the head of the bed, hoping for a dream of a bear (a traditional symbol of having a son). At the same time, everyone offered congratulations, and the master smiled and expressed his thanks.</p>
<p>▲ Neighbors' Gossip: This amusing scene happened on the first day of this month. I asked the neighbors about it. According to them, praying for children is common in this area, and prayers are often answered. There is a Temple of the Three Madams in the city, which is especially known for its miracles. Therefore, many people come from afar to seek children. They even cited a case of a family who had a son after praying. The family then had sons with every pregnancy, to substantiate their claims. Unsubstantiated stories are just that, and can be laughed at.</p>
<h3>The Wonderful Art of Guessing Characters</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Becoming a Buddha or an immortal is, after all, just a fanciful and illusory idea. In this era of scientific enlightenment, it is even disdained by enlightened people. However, stories of events that are indeed factual and bizarre are sometimes published in newspapers, and we cannot dismiss them all as absurd. There is a Mr. Yu, who lives near Yuewang Terrace. He has been exceptionally intelligent since childhood. After reaching adulthood, he devoted himself to quiet meditation and Buddhism. On the evening of Gengshen, he always sat cross-legged, as if he were an old monk in meditation. (According to custom, sitting cross-legged on the evening of the sixty Gengshen cycles can lead to becoming an earth immortal, but is this true? This should be questioned by Buddhist scholars.) It is said that he can see things that others cannot see, but people often do not fully believe this. One evening, at a banquet, he was also present. Curious people who had heard of his reputation eagerly asked him to try his magic to add to the entertainment. Mr. Yu smiled slightly and said, "What magic is there to speak of? If you insist, how about we play a guessing game?" Everyone agreed. Mr. Yu said, "You can write a character on plain paper in another room. The number of strokes and complexity are up to you. After writing, crumple the paper into a ball and put it in my mouth. I will then tell you the original character." So, everyone silently wrote characters and then put them into Mr. Yu's mouth in turn. Mr. Yu chewed and swallowed them and then wrote them down on another piece of paper in order. Sometimes it was one character, sometimes a sentence. Every time, it was accurate to the slightest detail. Everyone was astonished. Mr. Yu also mentioned that he had once traveled a long distance and suddenly ran out of food. He went three days without eating anything, and then he ate dozens of plums in a row without any discomfort. Alas, such a person is indeed different from ordinary people.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Ya Ge Opera Troupe's Spring Rehearsal</h3>
<p>— Lao Zhuo</p>
<p>Since the Ya Ge Opera Troupe reorganized its committee last year, it has greatly reorganized internally. As the 20th anniversary approaches, the members have been putting in extra effort for this grand celebration. They are preparing in many ways. First, they broadly solicit writings from famous people and compile them into a special publication. Second, they constantly rehearse the movements with reference to the scripts, striving for improvement. They are also recruiting members to participate in this grand event. As word spread, people joined one after another. Therefore, the three-day anniversary rehearsal last winter achieved obvious results in the eyes of everyone. However, many new members joined temporarily and did not have time to prepare for the performance. Therefore, on the evening of the first day of this month, a spring rehearsal was held at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association. A total of ten plays were performed. Most of them were performing for the first time. Although the results may not have been perfect, the atmosphere was full of vigor and everyone was excited to participate. Among the new members, Cao Liangjie, who plays the female lead, has both an excellent appearance and voice. Although he has only been studying for a short time, he is gradually showing promise and is truly an outstanding member of the opera community. Also, Ms. Ying Yun, a new member, began studying opera with Mr. Chen Yanheng last year. That evening, she made her debut in "Yutang Chun." Her voice was clear and beautiful. Chen accompanied her on the qin, enhancing the performance. The tune of "Liu Qingniang" and the erhu interlude of "(The child bought me at the age of seven)" were as enchanting as the delicate chirping of a warbler. It was truly extraordinary. Wang Detian and Hong Yanbin co-starred in "Breaking the Empress Dowager." Wang's painted face was black and clean, and his voice was like thunder, enough to startle the audience out of their sleep. (This play was performed past midnight.) Hong's portrayal of an old woman was perfectly in line with the drama, in both voice and action. Hong has a natural talent for music, and if he were to increase his studies, he would be even more impressive. In the last play, "Xiaoyao Jin," Zhang Yunji played Emperor Xian of Han with skillful acting and steady singing. Zhu Lianfu played Mu Shun, and Wu Laopu played Cao Cao. When Cao interrogated Mu Shun at the Meridian Gate, the dialogue between the two was very exciting and not the result of just one day's work. That evening, guests with tickets could enter a lottery and receive a special commemorative issue. Therefore, the audience was extremely crowded. The play ended at two o'clock in the morning. I returned home and wrote this down.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (142)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 9: The Celebrated Figures Laugh and Play Hide-and-Seek, a Beautiful Lady Offers Unreserved Protection</p>
<p>This startled the sixty-year-old birthday elder… "What are you looking for?" "I'm looking for Zuo Shichen." The elder said, "I know, I know…" He took Ruiyun's hand and led her to Zuo Shichen's side… He then looked at her again and said, "This little girl is very interesting… very lively… She's been calling you by name all the way here…" Ruiyun said, "Thank you, old man… He was hiding in this corner… deliberately not making a sound… to make it difficult for people to find him… Isn't that being naughty?" Shichen said, "What nonsense… How would I know that your highness was coming… and stand at the gate… respectfully awaiting your arrival?" The elder said, "Alright… for my sake… don't argue…" From then on… Ruiyun… whether in person or behind his back… always called him Zuo Shichen… Sometimes Shichen went to Ruiyun's place in Qinghefang… and when he stepped into their room… the first thing he would ask was, "Is Ruiyun back yet?" Sometimes Ruiyun came back early… and as soon as she heard Shichen's voice downstairs… slowly coming up the stairs… she would tell the people in the room… not to say she was back… so she could give him a scare… Little Auntie said, "Ah Nv, don't… You can scare someone to death!" Ruiyun said, "It's not like they'll die immediately… at least they'll lose their soul… and then they'll call 'joy' and it will come back…" It turned out that the doors in the rooms in Qinghefang… were all folding doors… When the door was opened… it would fold up… Ruiyun was petite… so she would hide behind the folded door… ready to jump out… and give him a scare… She also told Ah Jin to hide in the small room… Otherwise… if Ah Jin was seen… they would know that her highness was already back… Shichen walked into the room… and as usual… asked, "Is Ruiyun back yet?" The people in the room said, "She's not back yet…" Shichen initially believed them… because there were times when he came and Ruiyun wasn't back… But then he gradually saw the sly smiles on their faces… Hanyun deliberately said, "She usually comes back around this time… Why is she so late today… Is she out on a date with some distant suitor?" As she said this… she turned her face away… trying not to laugh… Shichen began to suspect something… He looked at everyone's faces… all with smiling expressions… so he asked, "Are you sure she's not back?" They said, "Really, she's not back… If she was back, she'd be in this room…" Shichen turned around… and saw the room door moving… He knew she was hiding behind the door… But he didn't expose them… He said, "Really, she's not back?…" He went to the coat rack and took down his jacket… and said, "Then I'll just go back… Looks like I won't be able to catch my little sparrow today…" Ruiyun was behind the door… and when she heard that Shichen was leaving… that he wouldn't be able to catch his little sparrow… she jumped out from behind the folded door… and said, "Don't go, don't go!… I was going to hide behind the door… and give you a scare… I saw you looking at me through the door… I thought you knew already… And you were all just laughing… that made me suspicious…"</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Trends Remain Soft</h3>
<p>The yarn market trend remains weak. Overseas yarn and cotton are in a state of chaos. Most people hold the view of shorting on rallies, so the market is extremely difficult to rise. However, the period is still within the spring sales season. Although inventory is high, factories are unwilling to sell at low prices. Some are afraid to short at the price of 51 or 52 taels. Based on the current actual situation, it is difficult to rise upward, but it is not the time for a sharp drop, so a fluctuating situation is already expected.</p>
<p>▲Spring Biao Recovers by Six Qian. The opening of the Ren Biao pre-market fell due to poor overseas cotton, and people's hearts were particularly uncertain. Selling sentiment was extremely strong, with each month falling by five or six qian. In the second and third sessions, a certain major dealer purchased a particularly large number of bales. Some said that there was good news in the situation, so the market became firmer, with each month rising by seven, eight, or nine qian to one tael. In the afternoon, some new selling emerged, and the market sentiment loosened again, with each month falling by one or two qian to six qian. Total transactions for the day were 16,500 bales. The closing prices of Ren Biao are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ren Biao Closing Prices, Rise and Fall, Inventory</p>
<p>Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory</p>
<p>March 1545 Up 6 37,100</p>
<p>April 1530 Up 6 43,900</p>
<p>May 1522 Up 6 32,750</p>
<p>June 1522 Up 7 21,700</p>
<p>July 1520 Up 5 19,500</p>
<p>August 1521 Up 4 5,350</p>
<p>▲Current Sales of Sichuan Goods Are Not Weak. The current path for yarn sales is still good. It is found that various gangs bought a total of 1,450 bales throughout the day, with 285 bales entered by fellow traders. Market conditions are average. Among the customer gangs, the Sichuan gang showed the strongest purchasing interest, accounting for 320 bales. In addition, 325 bales went to the inland, 225 bales to Tianjin, 80 bales to Zhenjiang, 65 bales to Niuzhuang, 140 bales to Guangdong, 20 bales to Wuhu, 20 bales to Jiangxi, 55 bales to Anqing, 70 bales to Fujian, 25 bales to Xiamen, 60 bales to Shantou, and 20 bales to Xuzhou.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Hovers Without Progress</h3>
<p>The Biao market is average, and the overall trend is also fluctuating, with an image of being difficult to advance or retreat. The overseas cotton market is weak due to the sharp contraction of exchange rates, and the downward trend is becoming more intense. As for Han cotton, due to high and firm land prices, some are closing off their spot goods and refusing to sell, with no intention of loosening. Therefore, the cotton market presents a confusing and perplexing situation.</p>
<p>▲Buying Sentiment for Han Biao Turns Strong. The opening of the futures cotton market in the morning session initially fell, but later buying orders surged again, with each month recovering by five fen to two qian and a half. The market sentiment was slightly calmer in the afternoon, and transactions in the market decreased, with each month falling back by five fen to one qian and a half. Total transactions for the day were 26,000 dan. The closing prices of Han Biao are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Biao Closing Price Rise/Fall Inventory</p>

<p>June 3425 Up 10 63,200</p>
<p>July 3430 Up 10 53,900</p>
<p>August 3440 Up 15 7,600</p>
<p>▲Current Demand Remains Quiet. Spot cotton business is still average. As for the source of goods at the docks, only 500 bales of Yao cotton arrived. The sales record is as follows:</p>
<p>Taicang Cotton 34.90 Pu Yi Factory entered 200 bales, sent to the factory</p>

<h3>US Farm Bureau's Cotton Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>▲Past Plans Have Shown Little Success</p>
<p>▲Farmers Acknowledge the Necessity of Reducing Cotton Acreage</p>
<p>New York Dispatch: The US cotton market price has continued to decline since last summer, and has now fallen to the lowest value since the great harvest of 1926-27. The authority of the Federal Farm Board has now become a question. The Federal Farm Board was established by Hoover last spring when he took office as president, as an agricultural relief agency. The main purpose of its establishment was to encourage and assist in the cooperative sales of agricultural products, in order to seek market price stability, with a reserve of $500 million in funds for circulation. Cotton prices maintained a considerable price last autumn, with no need for relief. Later, due to cotton farmers' eagerness to sell, market prices began to fall. The Farm Board then announced 16 cents per pound as the standard for relief. Therefore, although cotton prices were in a period of stock market panic, they were still able to maintain above 17 cents. In addition, in order to coordinate the cooperatives of various states, the Farm Board organized the National Cotton Cooperative Sales Association, with cooperatives that traded more than 100,000 bales per year as shareholders. It was established on January 15 with a capital of $30 million. The association has full authority over the sale of cotton and cottonseed from shareholders, and from the listing of new cotton this year, it has the right to operate not only in spot goods, but also in futures. It also has plans to establish branches in cotton market centers around the world. Although the association is operated by cotton farmers, it must obey the Farm Board's intentions due to its loan relationship with the Farm Board, and the agency's cotton policy is implemented by this joint organization. Therefore, the association's business policy has attracted much attention. However, after the association announced at the end of January that it (did not plan to buy in large quantities or buy in at an extra-legal high value), market prices suddenly collapsed, falling below the Farm Board's loan standard. This was due to cotton farmers' doubts about the association, which led to a sharp drop in market prices. Therefore, following the old trick of wheat, committees were elected by cooperatives in various states to form a Cotton Advisory Committee, and it was planned to establish a Cotton Stabilization Corporation. The role of the company is to buy surplus cotton from the market to stabilize the cotton market, and all losses are subsidized by the Farm Board. This matter has not yet been formally established. The Farm Board is coordinating cooperatives on the one hand, while also advising farmers to reduce cotton acreage, and has officially launched a campaign to reduce cotton acreage by 6 million mu (ie, a decrease of 1.25% compared to last year). However, its strength is scarce, because most cotton farmers are still in a favorable position. By February, the cotton market had fallen sharply again, and farmers painfully felt the need to reduce cotton acreage. The movement to reduce cotton acreage has recently intensified, and although it may not be able to reduce to the extent of 1.25% as proposed by the Farm Board, a considerable reduction may also be seen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Grain Distant Month Wheat Transactions Smooth, Market Vibrates</h3>
<p>▲Extremely Heavy Thunderstorms in Jiangbei Producing Areas...Hinder Wheat Harvest</p>
<p>After the opening of the morning and afternoon wheat futures yesterday, the current month did not open for the entire day due to the lack of agreement on buying and selling intentions. Although April opened, it was also quiet. However, distant new wheat transactions were smooth and the market was quite excited. The reason is that thunder and rain have been very strong in various Jiangbei producing areas. According to custom, if this situation occurs before the Awakening of Insects, it is feared that the wheat harvest will not be fully ripe in the future, so people's hearts have suddenly strengthened and buying customers have become smooth. As a result, April was one fen better than the previous day, June was three fen better, July was one fen better, and August was unchanged. The current wheat market is turning stable with the standard, and the mill stomach is quite good, with high-grade goods shouting one or two fen higher. Medium and inferior goods are still flat. Qingjiang wheat opened at 5 taels, 1 qian, 5 fen, 5 taels, 1 qian, 7 fen, Suzhou wheat at 5 taels, 1 qian, 7 fen, Anqing wheat at 5 taels, 1 qian, 5 li, 5 fen, inferior to 4 taels, 9 qian, 3 fen, Jiangxi wheat at 4 taels, 9 qian, 3 fen, 4 taels, 8 qian, 2 fen, 4 taels, 8 qian, Shashi wheat at 4 taels, 9 qian, 7 fen, Hunan wheat at 4 taels, 9 qian, totaling 3,350 bags, which were taken by Fuxin Fufeng, it is said.</p>
<h3>Spring Cold Increases New Flour Market Value</h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning and afternoon, recent months generally saw mixed gains and losses, while distant months were quite firm. This month, overseas wheat quotations were 4 or 5 jiao better (but Chicago May fell about 5 jiao), so the opening price was 2 taels, 5 qian, 5 fen, 2 li, 5 hao. However, it softened immediately afterwards, because the political situation has not reached a state of tranquility, and northern sales are unlikely to be active. The lack of progress is due to this. People's hearts are still stable in April and May, and the overall trend is fluctuating. However, the market conditions for new flour in June, July, and August are good, because the spring season is too cold and there must be a lot of rain. In addition, for the sake of the connection between new and old flour, there is a trend of being close to distant firmness. Therefore, there is a possibility that distant months may continue to rise higher when necessary in the future. As a result, this month was unchanged, April was 2 li and 5 hao better than the previous day, May was unchanged, June was 7 li and 5 hao better, July was 1 fen better, and August was 5 li better, it is said.</p>
<h3>Cotton Goods from Guangdong Searched for Fine Twill</h3>
<p>▲Factory Cotton Remained Firm Yesterday. The demand for fine cloth in this street is very strong, resulting in the near exhaustion of spot goods on the market. This is because the sales path of dyed cloth has emerged as a dark horse. Yesterday, the Sichuan, Hubei, and Wuhu gangs added a large number of Indanthrene fine cloth, all dyed by Guanghua and Guangzhong factories. The inland gangs' purchase of patriotic blue fine cloth is also not weak. Therefore, the smoothness of sales is second to none among all goods. Yesterday, the spot goods of Fourth Army, colored balls, and trumpets for children all fell. Fine twill was also quite lacking due to the Guanggang's vigorous search. Yesterday, the Ningbo gang entered 100 pieces of Cat Eagle, priced at 4 taels, 1 qian, 7 fen and a half. The Hubei gang entered 50 pieces of Seventeen-Pound Double Elephant, priced at 7 taels, 5 qian and a half. Coarse twill is still quiet, it is said.</p>
<p>▲The Overall Trend of Both Eastern and Western Piece Goods is Stable. Eastern goods were carried up by the sharp rise in Biao gold. Yesterday, Moganshan, Wild Goose, and Zhigong Ne all rose by 2 li and a half, opening at 2 qian, 5 fen and 7 li and a half. Shuangtong Deer opened at 2 qian and 3 fen and a half with no commission deducted. Yesterday, the Sichuan gang was slightly active in Zhongshan Ne. Fuyou Sihai has been completely sold out. The jiaoye book is sold at 2 qian and 4 fen. The new flower colors of Ting have gradually become sluggish, because the local Huai taste has been satisfied, so it is not as lively as before. Western goods are still active. Crepe de Chine, jacquard voile, and blue-striped nankeen have all been added by the northern gangs. Yesterday, the Shantou gang entered more than a dozen pieces of Zhuluo yarn. Ruikang Tianyuhua opened at 5 qian and a half, and Deji Flower Brand at 3 qian and 7 fen and a half, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Suddenly Stalls</h3>
<p>▲Due to Two Firms in the Industry Being Stranded</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market report: Cuban raw sugar price remains at 1.00, New York sugar futures March 1.58, May 1.67, September 1.82, December 1.92, only September fell 3 points compared to the previous report, and the rest fell by 1 point. The price of Java raw sugar is 10.25, down 125, March sugar futures price is 10.375, April is 10.50, with no rise or fall. The Association's market was divided because two firms in the industry were affected by the rising exchange rate and lost liquidity, and have already been stranded. Because of this, the market was greatly shocked. Most of those with thicker inventories are eager to sell, but there are few buyers and no inquiries. The asking price for Dutch sugar No. 24 coarse grain white is 7 taels, and 200 bags were traded in the aftermarket at a price of 7 taels and 0.5 fen. The market is particularly depressed and sluggish. The asking price for medium grain white is 6 taels and 8 qian and a half, Japanese sugar N mark is 7 taels and 7 qian, YP mark is 7 taels and 7 qian and a half, YT mark is 7 taels and 6 qian, all with few buyers. The market is weak, it is said.</p>

<p>New Inventions by Two Japanese Doctors</p>
<p>Animals Use Touch and Vision Instead of Hearing</p>
<p>People Can Live Up to Four Weeks by Fasting and Drinking Water</p>
<p>Japanese doctors Kuroda and Ohashi have recently published new research, which is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>▲Research on Animal Hearing Mr. Kuroda Ryo, professor of Niigata Commercial and Other Schools, has been studying animal hearing for more than ten years. He has recently completed (Comparative Psychology of Sound - a thesis) and obtained a doctorate in literature. The thesis describes the general hearing of animals, especially lower vertebrates. Using flutes, drums, and pistols to stimulate them with sound, he measured the eye and face reflection when they were surprised and analyzed it with ingenious machines. All of his statements are based on experimental results. According to the doctor's research, lizards, which were previously thought to be deaf, do not feel deaf, and snakes do not feel the sound of gunfire. Frogs, tadpoles, and salamanders are very deaf. Turtles are deaf in water and air. Although they seem sensitive to sound, they judge by vision and touch. Moreover, fish such as T-spotted fish, carp, and crucian carp do not feel sound at all, but judge by touch.</p>
<p>▲Research on Animal Fasting Dr. Ohashi Heiji of the Department of Surgery, Osaka Medical University, recently conducted two consecutive studies on a fasting field in Rakusei. It is said that according to the research results, in the fasting methods that have been practiced in the past, there is no absolute state of starvation because water is given arbitrarily. According to the animal experiments of absolute starvation he conducted, such as guinea pigs and domestic rabbits, if they are absolutely starved, they will die within five days to one week. At that time, the state of the blood is that leukocytes increase the most four or five days after fasting. Here, if a certain stimulus is added by surgery or medicine, the leukocytes will greatly increase. However, in humans, this is not the case because they drink water arbitrarily. In the first week, leukocytes hardly increase or decrease. They gradually increase from about one week or ten days after fasting. The stimulation test also shows a considerable increase in one week. Moreover, from the middle of the second week of fasting, the leukocytes increase, which is almost the same as the animal experiment. The results of the increased stimulation test show that the human body fasting experiment must be divided into three phases, and the first, second, and third weeks should be studied in detail. Fasting has no disadvantages. From the blood level, it can be judged that the resistance has an increasing tendency. People can live for four weeks if they drink water in a healthy body. Moreover, according to experiments, it is estimated that the time of absolute starvation is about two weeks before and after.</p>
<p>Estimate of U.S. National Wealth in 1928</p>

The meaning of (national wealth) refers to tangible tangible assets, such as farms, livestock, railways, public utilities, land, personal property, automobiles, gold and silver currency, etc. Credit and currency are not included.</p>
<p>Italy's Artificial Silk Industry is Developing Rapidly</p>
<p>Its Best Customers are China and India</p>
<p>The Two Countries Almost Combined Tin Half of Its Total Production</p>
<p>According to the Rome News, the development of Italy's artificial silk industry is faster than any other country and is one of Italy's most prosperous industries today. Italy's artificial silk production increased from only one million kilograms (hereinafter referred to as KIM) in 1919 to 24.1 million KIM in 1927, and increased again to 26.5 million KIM in 1928. The investment in the entire artificial silk industry is no less than 200 million lira. There are three major artificial silk manufacturing groups and seven small companies in the country. 93% of the total production is produced by the three major groups. In the first six months of last year, 15.205 million KIM of artificial silk was produced, which was an increase compared to the 14.367 million KIM in the same period in 1928. Artificial silk exports in 1928 slightly exceeded 15 million KIM, and silk heads were 2.185 million KIM. In the first seven months of 1929, the exports of artificial silk and silk heads totaled 11.239 million KIM, while in the same period in 1928, it was only 9.347 million KIM. Italy's best customers for artificial silk are India and China, which together account for more than 44% of total production. In Europe, Italy's main markets for artificial silk are Germany, Austria, and France.</p>
