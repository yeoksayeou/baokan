<p>時評</p>
<h3>日法政局與軍縮</h3>
<p>軍縮會議成功與否。其關鍵。海國方面在英美與日。大陸方面在英美與法。其形勢。早已顯然者也。日本與法。對英美皆堅持强硬主張而英美方面則尙猶。豫盤旋。未即决定其讓步與否之態度。如近傳所謂美國新提案尙。在官方否認之中其故何歟蓋。以待日法兩國政潮之結果也。日本議會此次之選舉。如果政友派獲勝。勢必引起倒閣。則在海會堅决之主張或將因以變更法國内閣此次之改組。如果左派獲勝。則必如其所倡導。實現修改軍縮政策之主張。是兩國政局之變動。實有使海會容易接近之希望。亦即使英美方面。不能不審愼觀察。以俟其結果者也。今日本選舉結果仍爲政府與黨勝利。當然仍繼續濱口内閣旣定之主張。法閣改組結果。勝利仍歸於泰狄歐氏。當然仍繼續泰狄歐之主張。則日法兩國。雖經過一度政潮。而對海會之政策依然不變即海會相持難决之爭點依然存在。其情勢又顯然者也</p>
<p>近日來海會消息。異常沉悶。有謂已發見接近之新途徑者然據上述情况觀。之。必英美方面確有讓步之表示。始有接近之希望但美國輿論。方以美代表不能堅决拒絕日法之要求憤憤然倡召回代表之議英議員在下院亦已有所質問。是英美讓步之說。終恐難以實現。而日法兩内閣之軍縮政策。旣新得議會多數之擁護。不啻更加一重保障。更不易望其讓步然則將何從發見其接近之機會乎。吾人誠不敢加以妄測矣</p>
<h3>接國内要電</h3>
<p>相待、語云、救鬥者不奮拳、先生就任副總司令之答詞曰、若再用武力、必至循環報復、近日漾電則曰、不當用干戈、亦不必用干戈、貫澈自已之宿諾、宜若何之絕緣、乃鄭州回車以後、中央因唐孟潇師潰、遂不窮追究其所在、又因石漢章意誠泰然盡忘其過舉、正圖開三中全會、整理庶政、努力建設、不謂先生之所謂漾電早已於月初紛派信使、四出煽動、以前未出鄭州、又以中華民國名義贈委若干總司令、一面戒嚴扣車、遣兵調將、竟欲何爲、不恤循環願爲其報使人復乎、抹去不字干戈當用其必用乎、樹欲靜而風不息、民衆休而先生又不許、眞不可思議之至矣、先生漾電又有曰、由黨爭而變爲兵爭、士兵則死亡枕藉、人民則困苦顚連、對外無禦侮之能、對内失統馭之力、先生叙往事也、然借先生今日之行動、直可爲未來畫一小照、突評三届、是謂黨爭、黨爭其名、本爲兵爭、於是死亡困苦、因之更甚、禦侮更無能、統馭更無力、亦爲必得之果、誰先黨爭、誰引兵爭、爲誰死亡、爲誰困苦、何至無能何竟無力、不幸先生首以三届發難、隠圖師出有名、於是死亡將爲先生、困苦將爲先生、無能無力、皆將由先生再産、先生而推及從前、則彼甲仆乙起丙倒丁興、忙若輪流瓜代　有如間日瘧發、彼等各先責難、無一非變相之先生也、中央雖無意卸罪、兵爭似乎已證明未爲戎首、是皆先生現身烘襯、形成如此耳、中央統馭無力、有慙德矣、然賢如先生、猶無端不受統馭、尙何言者、更舉痛史、尤爲對外無禦侮之能、伊誰致之、亦可由戎首間題略一討論、外交不嫌堅硬、本繼承於總理、以爲蘇俄能平等待弱小民族、政府欲自由取消不平等條約、當首收中東路、可以一無問題、豈知大上厥當、赤色帝國主義之毒辣、百倍於白色帝國主義、然禦侮猶可圖最後之共奮、不料所謂改組派、竟逞其方有外合遂起裏應、東師正與赤俄肉搏、張發奎即在鄂西發難、使中央無暇應援、近日察知一事、尤可痛心、即先生近習在京者、告我閻先生不满於中央、在東蘇戰爭時、亦有一疑點、其時謠傳中央將借拒俄之名、遣兵五萬、北行至津、遂　逗遛不進、解决河北、嗣後中央未遣一卒過津、即投鼠恐爲器所忌乎、而且張師旣竄湘西、馮師即接之攻豫、中央又不能不應此、汪先生常苦主義上之夾攻、故即於兵爭上發明夾攻以苦中央、且從而借此不助外戰、止顧内爭、又加以惡名、以爲返國活動之資料、是亦無賴矣、今先生批評禦係、乃知有兵五萬、曾委曲而不敢過津、無能又復出於先生之口、亦可傷也、終之此皆因事實而逆臆、未必即爲眞確、然若先生果不免於兵爭、先生將無以自辭、竟所謂兵士死亡人民困苦、亦成猫之哭鼠爲滑稽矣、故萬望先生雖有武力而竟不用、使弟失言、人民甚幸、黨國甚幸、率直附陳、惶悚無地、弟吳敬恒叩冬、（二日專電）</p>

<h3>後來居上樂華勝活塞司</h3>
<p>▲結果四對三</p>
<p>樂時昨日以四對三戰活塞司於甲組賽之一役、大出申園近萬觀衆意料之外、當其在零比三絕望之下、振作精神、力謀發展、精誠所至、金石爲開、竟然後來居上、打倒活塞司、旣隨聲譽、由是恢復、其大無畏之精神、至足欽慕矣、</p>
<p>▲周賢言功績卓著</p>
<p>樂華雖占勝利、但大半光陰、恒在敵軍壓迫之際、周賢言身當其衝、每自重　之中、危險之間、出其絕技化險爲夷、三球之失、咎不在其失職、而卒能防衛周至、不見再有失球之虞者、其卓著之功績有以致之、以故無論當日樂華、是否勝利、而其偉大之工作、固已炳耀於一時也、</p>
<h3>李惠堂智巧勝人</h3>
<p>樂華馮運佑·李寗·戴麟經·三大將之缺席、實力薄弱、槪可想見、一旦又逢以三對二打敗威德西而獲得高級杯錦標之活塞司、自覺難於對付、李隊長顧前思後、良費周折、初擬側重防衛、本人乃居内衛之一、轉戰不利、失去二球、下半時起、另換計劃、自身居中調劑、允中堅之職、又未得手、再失一球、三次變策、側重進攻、本人居座左内之職、以攻爲守、以冀萬之望、然而從此前鋒有力、敵軍返驚、而樂華内部、反覺减少風浪、且因此一帆順風、百達成功之域、如非李隊長智巧勝人、見機應變、則安有勝利之希望、惟是我人可毅然斷定、李惠堂萬不能再任内部要職、自絕其進取之途昨日之勝、即其明證也、</p>
<h3>陳虞添技藝大進</h3>
<p>陳虞添邇來技藝大進、在樂華前鋒中已占重要位置、而成爲不可缺少之一人也、每逢其出塲時、必予樂華相當貢獻、昨日上半時内、陳爲樂華前鋒唯一危險人物、連有三次佳妙之供給、惜乎接應乏人、咸無結果、自李惠堂出任左内後、方能勞而有功、樂華之凱旋、陳亦大功臣之一也、又昨日之王雍劼之珍演、亦較前大佳、其餘諸人、瑜瑕並見、</p>
<p>▲樂華隊陣綫（最後一次者）</p>
<p>王雄劼</p>
<p>胡民騰　陳鎭和　李惠堂周賢言　孫思敬　陳家球　　江善敬　陳璞　陳虞添　　　奚巧生</p>

<p>勃納脫　史密施　蕭氏品却　霍金生　史登萊　狼氏</p>
<p>愛格頓　史潘特　　唐恩</p>
<p>▲活塞司聲勢猖獗</p>
<p>劇戰開幕、樂華馮運佑·李寗·戴麟經均缺席替之者有江善敬·胡民騰·陳虞添三人、當時陣線江善敵李惠堂爲内衛、孫思敬仍爲中堅陳璞胡民騰前衛、前鋒自右至左、陳虞添·陳家球·陳鎭和·奚巧生·王雍劼·樂華實力不足、開始即遭壓迫一再招架、相延至六分鐘時、方被蕭氏攻入、其球非不峻急、然周之技藝、解之有餘、不料球在中間、經人一觸、改其趨向、致遭失守、樂華王雍吉劼努力前進、率達到挑送中央目的、奚巧生接而攻之、射向門外、繼之而有陳虞添三次佳妙之傳中、惜乏人接應、結果、徒令敵軍幾許驚駭、觀衆一時興奮而已、惟活塞司聲勢、至時益見猖獗、樂華區域、幾成兩軍交戰之點、周賢言爲衆矢之的、往往勇不顧身、解圍救險、後因内部外出協助、被活塞司中鋒狼氏乘虛直入、又中一球、上半活司二對一占先</p>
<p>▲樂華隊精神大振</p>
<p>下半時樂華陣缐更動、内衛江善敬胡民騰、中衛線璞李惠堂孫思敬、前鋒奚巧生陳虞添陳家球陳鎭和王雍劼、斯時形勢、樂華較前起色、然仍無補於事實、開塲活塞司敏捷而又合作之前鋒依然非常活動、周賢言二次挽救、方告偏安、不久活塞司又大舉入侵、右翼唐恩傳中、右内潘特加上一脚、球入綱中、樂華三球旣失、似至絕望之境、李隊長頓時變計、第三次更動陣缐、本人歸回左内原職、以厚前鋒實力、孫思敬與陳鎭和亦仍充中堅與左前衛老座、從此樂華努力猛進、死裏救生、不料活塞司中鋒狼氏又突入腹地前後左右、都無人踪、狼氏乃從容不迫、窥門直攻、周賢言乘其猶豫不决之際、出迅雷不及掩耳之身手、向前撲出竟然自其鐡蹄之下、抱球出險、全塲中西觀衆、莫不爲呌好不絕也、惟是樂華進取之精神、亦因此再度振發、李惠堂自人羣中遙送一球、轉予王雍劼攻打之機會、王處置適當、不負所期、獲球而歸、三分鐘之内、陳家球亦顯其身手、打在門之左柱、彈入綱内、樂華連獲二球、精神勃然未幾、陳虞添盤球進展最後又見王雍劼踢人、至時各獲三球、勝負相等、全塲空氣緊張、變方形勢嚴重、活塞司蕭氏狼氏互相射擊、咸被周所挽敵、李惠堂孤軍深入、巧避内衛、守門二人之阻礙、行將長驅直人、乃内衛先步趕到、被迫成角、王主踢、落點適中、互相撲擊陳虞添出脚迅速、椪然一聲、球人門中、樂華遂以四對三反占優越之形勢矣、李惠堂不幸受傷、出塲休養、然不久仍扶傷參加、蓋恐爲山九仞、功虧一簣也、結果四對三樂華後</p>
<p>來居上、</p>
<p>▲活塞司輕敵失敗</p>
<p>昨日活塞司人才平均、實力雄壯、當在開賽之初、其勝負之數、早有定論、觀其一再獲球、所向披靡、深恐是役樂華將有全軍覆没之虞、乃至獲中三球之後、忽起輕敵之念、終爲樂華後來居上、而自趨於失敗之境者、一念之誤也、噫、可以鑒矣、</p>

<h3>黄陂夫人之花木癖</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>黎黄陂夫人。日前在津門逝世。婺采遽沉。芳徽頓杳。平津各報。莫不競載其事。聞夫人平日嗜栽花木。雇花奴灌漑壅培外。更委侍婢摘敗葉。剔害蟲。珍護備至也。惟夫人不喜西洋之花。有貽之者。輒以轉贈閨友。曰夷花雖極煊爛。然少韻致。不足耐人細玩耳。當黄陂居揆席時。賓僚似雲。知夫人之有花木癖焉。往往輦載名種而來。夫人一一植諸於邸第之後園。有魚兒杜丹。色絕妍麗。枝十餘朶。朶似荷包。澹蕩韶光。春風占得。蓋與平常牡丹同時開放也。又合錦玫瑰。五色雜糅。花巨如盞。盛放之時。香氣穠郁。一二里可聞。但薰人易醉。花下不敢久坐也。又黄秋海棠。瓣若撚蠟所成。意態嫵媚且芬韾襲人。倘曾南豐有知。當不致再有海棠有色無香之恨矣。菊種更多。有玉毬。鶴頂紅。玉兎華。瑪瑙盤。碧江霞。醉楊妃。錦帶結同心諸名品。秋晚花開。常摘取之。藏於去　之老冬瓜中。然後以桑皮紙密封。今年廢歷元旦。夫人猶取鮮菊。饋贈戚屬。乃未幾即病。病竟不起。未免令人有花落人亡之感矣。</p>
<h3>鼠之𧏅毒</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>前日本報本埠新聞。轉載上海泰晤士報云。北四川路泰恒里。三十六號某宅。星期二夜。有一七齡童。被鼠噬及下唇。流血不已。知此鼠類猶其小者。而見有最大者一。且不驚避。突前噬及其母。受創甚重。洵奇談也。嗣母子兩人均送入醫院。并報告中國衛生局。該局派人携捕鼠器等。設法搜捕。乃止獲小鼠兩三頭</p>
<p>而已。附近隣右。咸謂時見有巨鼠出現。故莫不驚惶。以爲此鼠雖受挺擊。仍被其脫逃。後必爲崇云云。</p>
<p>余謂鼠之大者。無逾於昔年各報所載綏遠某地之鼠。有重至十餘斤者。且成羣結隊。結隊。結隊出没於白晝之間。然未聞有以齒囓人者。間所或見者。或於酣睡之際。被鼠咬及脚底。僅傷其研。則俗謂之不祥。固無大害也。</p>
<p>唯有一種名鼷鼠者。考之說文云。其形極小。而玉篇所載。亦云螫毒食人。以及鳥獸。皆不之痛。或名（甘口鼠）爾雅釋獸。鼷鼠。註云有螫毒者。博物志則以其形細。又名（耳鼠）。春秋成七年春。鼷鼠食郊牛角。而本草李巡注。又有食人及牛馬等皮膚成瘡。至死不覺。則斯鼠爲害大矣　　今某童被噬。係鼠之小者。而其母則係鼠之極大者。其創傷如何。須俟醫院中之報告而知。無從懸斷。吾謂考之古。且有甚於百斯篤者。（鼠疫）將來之鼠患。殆亦治安上一大問題。而衛生家不可等閒視之焉。</p>
<h3>靈峯探梅記</h3>
<p>— 松廬自杭州寄</p>
<p>說也慚愧。和西子結了兩年多鄕鄰的我。還没有到過靈峯。一半固然是爲的忙和懶。一半也因爲靈峯這個所在。地僻路遙。不大爲人注意友朋們都盛讚着靈峯之梅。遠勝孤山。於是就不禁一心嚮往之）可巧女友志文來邀遊玉泉。便順道往靈峯去了一趟。賞觀之餘。果然很是满意。</p>
<p>在湖濱僱了一輛汽車。於十分鐘之内。就給你送到了玉泉。玉泉是一個禪寺。雖然在此僻道。却因爲裏面有五色巨魚引人。所以游人畢至。我們走到魚樂池邊。和尙是照例泡上泉茗。送來兩碟麵餅。志文將餅餌擲入池中。引得羣魚前來爭食。結果整個的餅兒。總爲大魚奪去。剩下來的餅屑。方才輪到小魚兒沾唇。其實世間的人類。又何嘗不是如此。我們看了一回。問和尙到靈峯去的路徑。和尙告訴我說。從大路去。有二里多路。若由山徑越過。可以近一半路。我於是便要求和尙爲我們引導。那和尙向知客請了示。便偕我們從山路走去。道條山徑雖不十分崎嶇。却也累得我們都走乏了。那和尙引我們跨過了山。上了大道。便告辭而去。</p>
<p>我們走不上幾步。那石牌聳立處。（靈峯）二字已觸入我們眼簾了。一到此間。已見到兩旁疏疏的寒梅。正是含苞待放。不覺已提高了興緻。再向前進。便抵寺門。我們走進大殿。也無心瀏覽佛像。逕從旁邊一個小門裏穿出去。果然好一個梅園啊。但見地不甚廣。梅不甚多。而種植得却很得宜。其中約有五十餘株梅樹。十九猶在含苞。紅白皆有。尤異的。便是所謂綠萼梅。年來曾看過數十處的梅。這綠萼梅却是生平所僅見。我們便擇了一處梅花叢密處坐下。茶役泡上茶來。茗味不减玉泉。園中有一個池。池水泛作白色。池的面積。與紹興東湖的墨池相彷。而别饒風致。坐了一會。照相的走來兜攬生意。我們也就無可無不可的攝了兩張。看看時候已是不早。便促着志文早歸。臨行時和尙送了我兩枝紅梅。淸香可愛。我們循路回至玉泉。雇了黄包車到孤山坐船。看過了靈峯的梅花。再看孤山之梅時。竟不覺有大小巫之分了。怱怱游賞一會。便返船歸去。</p>

<h3>歐游通訊（四三）</h3>
<p>— 劉海粟</p>
<p>▲野獸羣Fauves（上）</p>
<p>我在巴黎的生活。一大半是看美術院Musee看畫廓Galerie從喬圖Giktto看到鮑顚西列Botticelli。從蒂靑Titien看到佛拉恭那Fragknard從普森Poussin</p>
<p>一直看到達維David。從安格兒Ingres一直看到塞尙Cezanne。我是一無問題抱了謙虛淵淡的心。將各時代的藝術毫無顧慮地感到他那各特點。或者在於羅佛宮的西班牙畫室。走到荷蘭作家的那幾間。雖然各有他那不同的特點。終是不至於使我訝異起來。甚至看完了羅佛宮再走到盧森堡宮去看現代的作品。也没有什麽十分激動。在於我每次走完了幾家畫廓以後終是引起我無窮的内心的變化。有時迷。有時悟。這是很有意味的。在巴黎一千多家畫廓。他們所販買的展覽的陳設的。可說一致都是野獸派的作品。印象派和後期印象派的作品也就很少見了。二十世紀法國的藝壇。早已爲野獸羣Fauves所佔據了。就是秋季沙龍Salon　DAutomne和獨立沙龍Salon　Artidtes　Independants或者沙龍樗臘呂LeSalon　Des</p>
<p>Tuileries。他們雖然各有不同的性質。代表着現在法蘭西的藝術。但是你仔細看那裏面的重要作品。大都是野獸派大人物的手筆。就此可以想見一般了。　　野獸主義Fauvisme的名詞已發見二十年了。但到現在明白他的意義的恐怕還没有多少人。這種情形在西洋美術史知識極端幼穉的中國原無足怪。什麽印象派後期印象派在現在歐洲的藝壇。已成爲過去的東西了在於中國便是掛着美術家招牌的有幾個人能淸楚。那又怎會理解到對着後象派反動生起的野獸派。何况野獸派又比較的難理解。這樣看來。我現在來介紹野獸派自不免有些不合時宜。可是從别一方面看來。這種介紹又覺得很緊要。現在西方的新美術已經不絕地零零碎碎的傳到中國。那混亂的情形。眞令人尋不不出個端緒。有些時髦的人物隨便揀取一點來談塞尙·梵高·瑪諦斯以及立體派。未來派。其實何嘗懂得。不過隨便圖個新奇聳聽而已。還有些人閉着兩眼狂叫。高呼描寫外形。提倡官學派的死技巧。這類都和西方新藝術隔開了幾萬萬里。儘管他們也算熱心傳布。可是實際上相距在遠没有絲毫有利的結果。現代的美術是帶着世界的性質。没有什麽國度的界分。我們現在要研究西方美術。並不是因他産生在西方之故。也因他含着世界性質。要明新興的美術。也是認他在世界性質的美術發展上比較激進的一個過程。現代的時代。不是宗炳王微的時代了。不是山林隠居閉户揮毫的時代了。一切思想都帶着世界的性質激動着。是不容你不接受混交的。所以要談藝術不能不明白現代新美術思潮。不但明白一些形式便算。還要探求他的根本精神。一切能淸楚了。我們要替固有的美術在現在重行估定一種價値自也有個趣向。加入那世界的美術潮流和别人一同前進。否則只管閉目高呼國有藝術。販賣古董。自然只有步步落後。因爲我們祖宗的偉大的遺産。是歷史上的一種榮光。現在我們也一樣要努力創業。但是現代歐洲美術的根本精神是怎樣的呢。可說就是野獸派的精神。要理解現代美術的眞際。應該先明白野獸派的經過。</p>
<h3>共和鳥</h3>
<p>— 嵆覲</p>
<p>湖州西鄕之獨樹村。有一柏樹。高約百尺。周可四五抱。枝葉繁茂。望如華蓋。相傳爲數百年前之古物。其上營有鳥巢。無慮百數。有拙如鳩者。有怪如梟者。有强悍如鷹者。有嬌小如百靈者。生長斯間。不相殘殺。甚至覓食哺乳之事。可令他種代効其勞。而村人錫以嘉名。統稱之曰共和鳥。</p>
<p>一日。忽有怪鳥至。其大如鵬。直向樹頭猛撲。共和鳥合力抵禦。大者當前。不者在後。衝鋒對壘。如臨大敵。約一小時之久。怪鳥卒以獨力不支。遠颺而去。其時收拾餘部。見同類中有少數仆地。負傷而不能飛者。則一一啣之歸巢。村人服其義勇。廣爲宣傳。百里以内。無不知有共和鳥之名。噫可以人而不如鳥乎。</p>

<h3>太陽黑點增加　與最近之宇宙變動</h3>
<p>太陽與地球之物理的關係明瞭呈現</p>

<h3>勃朗寧夫人的書札昌·溪·</h3>
<p>詩人勃朗寧和勃勒提兩人的戀愛、是被認爲自來文學家戀愛中最美满的一對、她倆在未相愛前並没有其他的戀愛經歷、在相愛以後、又和諧到死都没有裂痕在爲許多文學家羡慕贊美的一對詩人的一切是値得人們注意的、</p>
<p>勃朗寧夫人從家裏逃往意大利去結婚後、使得她從家庭得不着她感、連她的妹妹也似乎不满意於她的行爲、不過她的妹妹以後也從家庭内逃出來得着結婚的自由、算是與她起了共鳴、因此、她在贊美妹妹的勇氣之餘、便同妹子寫了許多長而有趣的信、在最近赫克胥黎（Leonard　Huxley）加以深切的考慮而編輯的勃朗寧夫人寄她妹妹的信、－一八四八到一八五九年的十一年間的信、可以窺見　和詩人的結婚生活、和她姊妹間的感情、</p>
<p>這十一年所寫下的信、都是在一八四六年與詩人結婚後寫下的、在信中是很激發於熱情的寫着許多（親愛的、親愛的　最親愛的）等字樣但是終於不能把她們倆人心中的介介於懷的往事完全掩飾、全部的書信都是加蓋着意大利的郵印、而且内中還向她遠居在英國的妹妹報告出許多關於意大利國家那時的破敗情形、爲許多歷史上没有記載過的、</p>

<h3>寡婦再醮問題卓·君·</h3>
<p>新近出版的生活週刊、有一篇文章係紀載張軼歐君和吳震女士的結褵的原委、並且重重的讚許它們是（一對有義勇的賢伉儷、）這是多麽値得我們注意的事啊、</p>
<p>誠然、男子死了妻室、有復娶的權</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>利、女子死了丈夫、也應有復嫁的　利、站在平等主義上來說話、這可以算是絕對的没有什麽能力呈威力去加以制止或阻擋的、張君和吳女士都不肯放棄它們賦有的固有的權利、在這裏就可以窺見它們的精神了、</p>
<p>如果在今日還循着吃人的禮敎的路上去走、則張君和吳女士那裏能夠結出這麽樣的果子來、</p>
<p>尤其是我們中國的歷來慣例、女子死了丈夫是不許再醮的、以爲再醮就是失節、失節的女子是給人們瞧不起的、寗可餓死不可失節、鑄爲寡婦金科玉律的格言、在我們中國内地還是那麽樣的、如果你娶着一個寡婦、就會當你是一個下流的人物、張君娶的是一個居寡二十餘年的吳女士、並且是一個已經逝世底張夫人的妹妹、那末、張君豈不是富有革命精神的嗎、不過我們覺得吳女士居寡二十多年、尙能跳出禮敎的陷阱、那是好像尤其富有革命精神的了、</p>
<p>誠然、在今日而言寡婦是没有許嫁不許嫁的問題了、換一句話說、就是只有願嫁不願嫁及可嫁不可嫁的問題、我們可以說、世界各國除了我們貴國以外、好像是没有什麽叫做守節制度的、我們中國幾千年來、是拿忠與節並稱的、秦始皇特地築造女懷淸臺、獎勵女子守節、隋朝又有官員九品以上、夫亡、妻不許改嫁、五品以上、夫亡妾不許改嫁的詔諭、自唐以降、禮敎的束縛益甚、雖然也有少數者能夠穿破禮敎而行其心之所安、譬如韓愈的女兒初適李漢、後來再醮於樊宗懿、薜居正妻柴氏、後來復嫁於張齊賢、像這種的例子、在歷史上還可尋得許多出來、可是大部份或百分之九十九、總是爲禮敎所束縛並是守節制度的惡毒、而終生寂悶空幃而不敢再醮的、</p>
<p>其實、似乎應該没有什麽疑議吧、寡婦再醮、是寡婦賦有固有的權利、在寡婦有自由的意志、别人當然不能强偪她不嫁或强偪她要嫁、有些雖然是丈夫已經死了、她却願度着寡婦的生活、她的意志是不願再嫁、或者因爲環境的關係是可以不嫁的、那末、虽偪她再醮的人、在法律上是犯法的、據我所聞、中國内地還有許多來用掠奪的方式而使寡婦於再醮、土豪劣紳、往往於中取利、那種慘無人道的勾當、恐怕還要比較强偪她守節厲害得十分、她却因爲子女成行、將來有所依靠、或者遺産尙豐、得以過其不担憂的日子、而土豪劣紳、往往威迫她再嫁、還有不明事理不知法律的翁姑、往往貪得身價、不惜威迫她再嫁或秘密進行的讓别人來掠奪去、那眞是豈有此理、</p>
<p>復次、有些處也是一樣感着苦痛吧、就人情說、年紀輕輕的女子、正在一個如花似玉的時期中、不幸死了丈夫、一定要她獨守空闈、這豈不是强人之所難、就是剥削摧殘女了（寡婦們）的權利嗎、在我們中國的　地、很有許多的人家、還是存有一個什麽（家聲攸關）的觀念、以爲兒子死了、媳婦儘管將她桎梏起來、不然、讓媳婦再嫁、就覺得不體面没有臉光、無論媳婦的意志是不願於守節、却須備她守節、其實、守節是個人的自由意志、難道可以强迫她的嗎、那麽、她如果是一個寡婦、她一定要嫁或再醮、如果制止她或抑遏她、這是和那可不嫁不願嫁却要逼迫她再醮是一樣犯法法的</p>
<p>總之、寡婦有寡婦的自由意志、再醮不再醮、可以說完全是要她們自已打主意的、換一句說、這是她們自身的事、别人似乎不便干涉她們吧、</p>

<h3>Wu Zhihui Earnestly Persuades Yan</h3>
<p>Elaborating on the Sufficient Reasons for Appointing Representatives to the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan Xishan telegraphed Wu Zhihui, raising many questions about the appointment of representatives to the Third Plenary Session. Wu Zhihui replied to Yan in a telegram, earnestly persuading him. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>One, Yan's Telegram to Wu: "Wu Zhihui, respected elder, greetings. I am replying to a telegram from the Guangzhou Special Municipality Party Headquarters, which stated: 'Having received and read Ma's telegram, I am deeply grateful for your insightful advice. I am fortunate and grateful that you did not spare your efforts despite the distance. However, the four matters you inquired about do not align with the facts. We telegraphed each other cleverly, and I trust you have already received them and understood the situation. Now, I would like to share a word with my comrades regarding the facts of the Party. Under Party rule, the National Congress is the Party's highest authority. Its position is even more elevated and respected than the National Assembly of the Republic of China. If the National Assembly of the Republic of China were to have over half of its members appointed by one person, it could not be called a republic. If the National Congress of the Party-State were to have over half of its representatives appointed by someone, could it still be called a Party-State? Upon investigation, the Third National Congress had a total of 406 attending representatives, of whom 211 were appointed, 122 were designated, and only 73 were purely elected. Can this Third National Congress still be called the Third National Congress of the Kuomintang? If my comrades believe that this type of congress can still be called the Third National Congress of the Kuomintang, then I will admit to all the offenses you accuse me of. Otherwise, my comrades should also rise up and fight for what is right, and not succumb to the present moment and later regret it. Wu Zhihui stated that the matter of designation was based on precedents from the first and second plenary sessions. At the time of the establishment of the first and second sessions, the Kuomintang only ruled Guangdong Province, and the other provinces were all engaged in underground work. Designating representatives was a matter of necessity. But when was the third session established? If we continue to follow this example forever, can the Party-State still be inquired about?' I am specially presenting this for your consideration. Yan Xishan, respectfully."</p>
<p>Two, Wu's Reply to Yan: "(1) To Deputy Commander-in-Chief Yan Baichuan, Taiyuan, greetings. I am deeply moved and admire your respectful telegram. You no longer doubt that the designation was based on precedents. The dispute lies in the current situation. However, the reason for the first and second sessions being based on underground work does not align with either theory or facts. In terms of the current situation, designation is even more important in the third session. Minor disputes have suddenly been magnified. All previous reactions were not really about what they seemed to be about, but merely used as a pretext for action. You oppose the use of force, yet you suddenly occupy this pretext for action, causing great suffering to the people, which is extremely ominous. The Party-State is being torn apart, and the responsibility lies with the military leaders. I am committed to searching for ways to help. I have written another four thousand words and sent them separately. Your younger brother, Wu Jingheng, bows in winter. (2) To Deputy Commander-in-Chief Yan Baichuan, Taiyuan, greetings. I am deeply moved and admire your respectful telegram, forwarding the full text of your telegram to the Guangzhou Special Municipality Party Headquarters, inquiring about my humble opinions with a sincere love for the Party and a humble attitude towards friends. Now, I respectfully offer my humble opinion. You no longer doubt that the designation was based on precedents. What remains to be discussed is that in the first and second sessions, all provinces were engaged in underground work, but the third session was established when that was no longer the case, so there was no need for designation. Therefore, you doubt the third session. This is a reason often cited by reactionary elements. You were suddenly deceived by them and used it as an excuse. In reality, the designation in the first session was to prevent corruption. The designation in the second session was to be pro-Communist. The designation in the third session was to eliminate Communists. This is simple and clear, understood by everyone, and even a child can understand it. Sophisticated and convoluted explanations are merely a waste of effort. If you say that the first and second sessions were all engaged in underground work, so designation was necessary, this contradicts both theory and facts. If they could work in secret, then there would be secret organizations everywhere, and they could elect the most solid representatives according to their respective groups. An election could be completed overnight. Why would it be necessary to set up meeting places, post notices, and forcibly display forms under the supervision of warlords in order to be considered an election? Therefore, saying that it was inconvenient to hold elections in secret is theoretically untenable. Moreover, in the past, the most designated representatives in the first congress were from the various open departments in Guangzhou, while provinces like Hebei and Anhui actually had elected representatives. Therefore, saying that designation should not be used in public situations does not align with the facts. In reality, the reason for designation in the first session was entirely to prevent all the old, confined party members from the past from randomly sending representatives who would only cause trouble for no reason. The reason for designation in the second session was to prevent anti-communist elements from becoming representatives, which would hinder cooperation with the Communists. The overall reason is as such. Therefore, using secrecy as the reason for designation is truly not worth a child's smile. As for the severity of the situation in the third session, it far exceeded that of the first and second sessions. In April of the sixteenth year, Mr. Wang returned from Moscow. We tearfully pleaded with him to oppose the Communists. Mr. Wang and Chen Duxiu jointly issued a declaration. In the winter of that year, we knelt before Mr. Wang again. Mr. Wang then orchestrated the massacre in Guangzhou, verbally chanting anti-communism but actually enjoying its use. They should have formed a chain of connections, secretly, with A, B, C, and D. Even if the lotus root is broken, the silk thread remains connected. This is the painful mindset of those who call themselves leftists, afraid of falling behind in their thinking. Looking at the declaration of the Guangdong Provincial Communist Party Executive Committee on November 28 of the sixteenth year, as seen in the ninth issue of the Bolshevik magazine, it says that Zhang Fakui, Chen Gongbo, Li Jishen, and Huang Shaoxiong cannot be distinguished even under a microscope. This is true anti-communism. It also says that Zhang and Chen have come to request cooperation again. We only need the conditions to be compatible. We would even allow the Northern Warlords if they requested it, let alone Zhang and Chen. This is certainly using people. In the first and second sessions, the enemy was the warlords. Although we feared that spies would infiltrate, most of them were few in number and unskilled, not worth deep prevention. In the third session, the enemy was the Communist Party and the blindly utilized tools of the Communist Party. These people were ubiquitous, capable of rigging votes, carrying ingots of gold and iron rods without making a sound, and slipping into the heart of the matter. Mr. Wang deeply tasted this, so there was a so-called designation method. The elections of party departments at all levels still use this method to this day. Recently, the party departments in Beiping and Hebei in the past were all designated, and they are now considered loyal and reliable. Little did they know that, as a result, you frowned and looked distressed, unable to believe that there were many pro-Communists among them. When Mr. Jiang came to Ping last autumn and verified it, he believed it and reported it to the Central Government, which then dismissed and replaced them. Even the designated ones were like that. If they had blindly welcomed the reactionary elements, the constitutional era should have had this kind of congress, but the period of political tutelage truly did not have this kind of party discipline. Furthermore, you say, "If it is designated by one person," and then you say, "If someone designates." The person you are referring to is probably Mr. Jiang. In the second session, everyone blamed Mr. Wang for the designation. In the third session, they will also blame Mr. Jiang. The eaves tiles are focused on the longest one sticking out; that is the nature of the matter. Unfortunately, it does not align with the facts. In order to avoid selfish preferences, you do not need to ask others. You can ask Mr. Li Delin, who is vehemently opposed to the Third Plenary Session today. After the Guangzhou massacre, Mr. Li and I naturally and frankly opposed the so-called Guangdong Committee members. Those who excused them at the time were Mr. Jiang. Mr. Li's comrades sent telegrams to Wuhan daily, saying that they should be punished and expelled as a whole. In the end, Mr. Jiang stopped them. However, afterwards, they attacked and struggled together, and the tide rose for a time. The revolutionary commentary and the universities on the mainland even boasted that this was their own idea. Mr. Jiang painstakingly accommodated dissidents and sought to quell party disputes, which was known to everyone. Therefore, when the three major generals were about to hold a meeting, Mr. Li and others were worried that these representatives would fill the meeting. Previously, I telegraphed Mr. Ci Long and told him that the executive and supervisory committees had occasionally gathered at Tangshan. Some people believed that if the election was too complete, the Party would be destroyed. To ensure the Party's completeness, the election should only be inherited. At that time, Mr. Li and I were both watching Mr. Jiang. When Mr. Jiang also nodded in agreement, everyone was pleased. Later, when the executive and supervisory committees held a regular meeting, they all believed that the Third Plenary Session's resolution should continue to use the designated precedents. If Mr. Li is not forgetful, he would definitely not want to attribute the designation in the third session to Mr. Jiang alone. Therefore, the designation in the first, second, and third sessions was all out of necessity. If you say that you do not have the Prime Minister's talent but want to have the Prime Minister's adaptability, it seems like carving a mark on a boat to find a sword, with no progress at all. The executive and supervisory committees following Mr. Wang and Mr. Jiang in the second and third sessions should all bow their heads and have nothing to say. If you believe that this damages the Party discipline, then the Prime Minister in spirit will smile. Therefore, your position...</p>
<p>...The reactionary elements are pointing fingers at the Third Plenary Session, which is quite unreasonable. Demanding a perfect election, before the upcoming Fourth Plenary Session, you, sitting in the Central Party Headquarters, suggest that there should be no more designation, so as not to continue this example forever. Naturally, this is also a perfect theory. However, whether the future facts will allow it or not is still a question. After all, when forced by the circumstances, one should still adapt. The Prime Minister seldom made mistakes. It is better to continue his method of designation, which is more appropriate. Confucius said, "It will be enough in a month, but it will be accomplished in three years." After another three years, and up to the fifth session, it will definitely not be necessary to continue the old example forever. It seems that you do not need to worry too much. As for your high opinions contributed to the people of the time, such as combining the executive and supervisory committees of the three sessions into a cadre and having all party members vote, these are not listed in the Party Charter, nor are they seen in the posthumous works. Everyone deviates from the Prime Minister's teachings and considers it their own opinion. This is one right and that is one wrong. The result of desiring the entire Party will inevitably be more broken. However, we should silently plead to the Prime Minister's spirit, so that the fourth session will not need to be adapted, which would be very fortunate. Therefore, the adaptation of the example in the third session is absolutely unobjectionable. From Li Bai's resistance to Meng Xiao's rebellion, their declarations each had shortcomings compared to the third session. You either condemned their chaos or punished their rebellion, without hesitation. On New Year's Day, I saw you off in Taiyuan on the car to punish Tang, fiercely denouncing Tang as a traitor to the third session. However, not even a month has passed, and it suddenly seems like a different world, with the city walls still the same, but the people no longer the same. If Bai, Li, Zhang, and Tang had all been personally condemned by you, you suddenly became dizzy and fell to the ground. Standing up, their vehemence was attached to you, and you loudly and frantically discussed the third session, as if it were coming from your own mouth. This is not to dare to be disrespectful and outrage you. At this point, I am truly shocked by the two people before and after, indescribable, and unaware of your own absurdity. Unpardonable sin! Or there may be those who go a step further and speculate, saying that this is actually normal. It is because someone wants to place you on the fire, so that the one who vehemently opposes the use of force can try on military uniform for once. Then the world can be greatly stabilized, wanting the deployment of troops to have a justifiable cause, making the third session a sacrifice for its name. Alas, you can rest now. The people's weariness of chaos has long been indiscriminate. Whether there is a name or not, they are seen as the same. If you truly go to hell, the people will also...</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Japanese and French Political Situations and Disarmament</h3>
<p>Whether or not the disarmament conference succeeds depends on England, America, and Japan on the naval side, and on England, America, and France on the continental side. This situation has been clear for some time. Japan and France are both adhering to strong demands against England and America, while England and America are still hesitating and considering whether or not to concede. As for the recent rumors of a new American proposal being officially denied, the reason for this is probably to wait for the results of the political tides in Japan and France. If the Seiyukai party wins this election in the Japanese parliament, it will inevitably lead to a cabinet collapse. The firm demands at the naval conference may change as a result. If the left wing wins this cabinet reshuffle in France, it will inevitably implement the proposed revision of the disarmament policy. The changes in the political situations of these two countries really hold the hope of making the naval conference more accessible, and they also prevent England and America from being able to avoid carefully observing in order to await the results. Now, the election results in Japan still show the victory of the government and the party. Naturally, the existing claims of the Hamaguchi cabinet will continue. The results of the cabinet reshuffle in France are still the victory of Tardieu. Naturally, the existing claims of Tardieu will continue. Therefore, although the political tides in Japan and France have undergone a round, their policies on the naval conference remain unchanged. That is, the point of contention in the naval conference remains. This situation has also been clear for some time.</p>
<p>In recent days, news from the naval conference has been exceptionally gloomy. Some say that a new path to rapprochement has been discovered, but according to the above situation, there must be a definite indication of concessions from England and America for there to be any hope of rapprochement. However, the American public is angrily advocating for the recall of representatives, feeling that the American representatives have not firmly rejected the demands of Japan and France. Members of parliament in the British House of Commons have also raised questions. Therefore, the claim of concessions from England and America may ultimately be difficult to achieve. The disarmament policies of the Japanese and French cabinets have now newly gained the support of the parliamentary majority, as if receiving an additional layer of protection, making concessions even more difficult to expect. Then, where will the opportunity for rapprochement be discovered? We truly dare not recklessly speculate.</p>
<h3>Receiving Important Domestic Telegrams</h3>
<p>They wait for each other. As the saying goes, "He who tries to stop a fight should not join it." Your response to your appointment as Deputy Commander-in-Chief said, "If force is used again, it will inevitably lead to cyclical revenge." Recent telegrams state, "It is not appropriate to use weapons, and it is not necessary to use weapons." How should you sever ties while consistently maintaining your old promises? After returning from Zhengzhou, the Central Government, due to the defeat of Tang Mengxiao's troops, did not pursue the matter, and because Shi Hanzhang was calm and composed, the Central Government forgot his misdeeds. The Central Government was planning to hold the Third Plenary Session, reorganize administrative affairs, and strive for construction. Contrary to expectations, the so-called Yan telegram had already been sent out at the beginning of the month, with messengers spreading agitation everywhere. Before he had even left Zhengzhou, he had already granted the titles of several commanders-in-chief in the name of the Republic of China. At the same time, he imposed martial law, detained cars, and dispatched troops. What did he intend to do? Would he disregard the cycle and be willing to act as its messenger? Should he erase the word "not" and use weapons when necessary? The tree wants to be still, but the wind does not stop. The masses want to rest, but you do not allow it. This is truly incredible. Your telegram also states, "If party strife turns into military strife, the soldiers will die in piles, the people will suffer hardship, and there will be no ability to defend against external aggression, and there will be no power to control internally." You are narrating past events. However, your actions today can be used to paint a small picture of the future. Criticizing the Third Plenary Session is called party strife. Party strife in name is essentially military strife. As a result, death and hardship will be even more severe. There will be no ability to defend against external aggression, and there will be no power to control internally. What is to be gained? Who started the party strife? Who led the military strife? For whom will they die? For whom will they suffer? How will they become incapable? How will they lose power? Unfortunately, you were the first to start with the Third Plenary Session, secretly plotting for the dispatch of troops to have a justifiable cause. As a result, death will be for you, hardship will be for you, and incompetence and powerlessness will be produced by you again. If you extend this to the past, then those who blame first, without exception, are transformed versions of you. Although the Central Government does not intend to shirk responsibility, military strife seems to have proven that it is not the one who started it. All of this is supported by your present actions, forming this situation. The Central Government lacks the power to control, and it is ashamed of its virtue. However, even someone as virtuous as you still unreasonably refuses to be controlled. What else can be said? Furthermore, let us bring up the painful history, especially regarding the inability to defend against external aggression. Who caused this? This can also be discussed briefly by the one who started the military strife. Diplomacy should be firm and should inherit the principles of the Prime Minister, who believed that Soviet Russia could treat small and weak nations equally. The government wanted to freely abolish unequal treaties and should first take back the Chinese Eastern Railway, which would solve the problem without any issues. Who knew that, in reality, the viciousness of red imperialism was a hundred times worse than that of white imperialism? However, defending against external aggression could still be achieved through a final joint effort. Unexpectedly, the so-called reorganization faction would give full play to their external collusion and internal response. The eastern troops were fighting hand-to-hand with Red Russia, and Zhang Fakui started the trouble in western Hubei, leaving the Central Government with no time to provide support. Recently, one thing has been discovered that is especially painful. That is, one of your close aides in Beijing told me that you were dissatisfied with the Central Government. During the Eastern Soviet War, there was also a suspicion. At that time, it was rumored that the Central Government would use the excuse of resisting Russia to dispatch 50,000 troops north to Tianjin, and then linger without advancing in order to resolve Hebei. Afterwards, the Central Government did not send a single soldier past Tianjin, fearing that the instrument would be damaged when throwing something at a rat. Moreover, after Zhang's troops fled to western Hunan, Feng's troops immediately attacked Henan. The Central Government had no choice but to respond to this. Mr. Wang often suffered from attacks from both sides in terms of principles, so he invented attacks from both sides in terms of military strife to cause the Central Government pain. Furthermore, he used this as an excuse not to assist in the external war, only caring about internal strife, and adding the infamy that it was a source of activity when returning to the country. This is also unscrupulous. Now that you are criticizing the system of defense, it is known that there were 50,000 troops who were hesitant and dared not cross Tianjin. Incompetence also comes from your mouth, which is also regrettable. In the end, all of this is speculation based on facts, and may not be entirely accurate. However, if you cannot avoid military strife, you will not be able to excuse yourself. The so-called soldiers dying and the people suffering will also be as ridiculous as a cat mourning a mouse. Therefore, I sincerely hope that you will not use force, even though you have it, so that I may be wrong. The people will be very fortunate, and the Party-State will be very fortunate. I am respectfully and frankly submitting this, trembling with fear. Your younger brother, Wu Jingheng, bows in winter." (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>The Third Plenary Session Examined Proposals Yesterday</h3>
<p>Four Groups on Party Affairs, Politics, Economy, and Education Separately Examined the Proposals</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Third Plenary Session resolved yesterday to organize a Proposal Examination Committee, divided into four groups: Party Affairs, Politics, Economy, and Education, to separately examine the various proposals.

<h3>Yan Replies to the Presidents of the Three Academies</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yan replied to the respected telegram from the presidents of the three academies, Tan, Hu, and Wang, on the 28th. The contents are as follows: "A brief description. Regarding the rumor of Mr. Jiang's resignation, it can be canceled. Regarding the rumor of my own resignation, it cannot be canceled. I have explained this in detail in the telegram to Mr. Jiang, and I trust that you have already seen it. As for my many arguments about innocence, for the sake of the Party and the country, since I have not been forgiven, what more can I say? As for Feng's troops suppressing bandits in the Zhili region, they have not reached western Shandong. I am replying specifically. Yan Xishan, personally." (2nd)</p>
<h3>Liu Zhi Telegraphed to Advise Han and Shi</h3>
<p>To Make Further Expressions</p>

"With you and Brother Hanzhang, having sworn loyalty to the Central Government and with your resolve as firm as gold and stone, I still hope that you will quickly make further claims and express your anti-Yan attitude. Then, the prestige you spread will surely chill the courage of the rebels. Sweeping away the rebellious party will be easy." (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<h3>The Transportation of the Jinpu Railway</h3>
<p>Southbound Cars Only Run to Lianzhen</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the No. 201 train on the Jinpu Railway left for Lianzhen on the evening of the 28th, it returned to the Tianjin station on the morning of the 2nd due to the lack of a northbound train to meet it. It was changed to Nos. 9 and 10, running between Tianjin and Lianzhen. According to officials from the railway bureau, the northbound train only runs to Pingyuan. There are no troops in Dezhou, and the ground is very peaceful. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fu Zuoyi telegraphed Chen Tiaoyuan yesterday, stating briefly that the No. 2 northbound train on the Jinpu Railway has not arrived, causing the southbound train to temporarily stop at Lianzhen. If there are no obstructions, please order the passenger cars to go north to maintain traffic. The reply received from Chen stated briefly that he had no right to interfere with the running of trains and that maintaining traffic was a mutual concern. If the southbound train could go south, then the northbound train would naturally be able to go north. Due to the interruption of the Jinpu train southbound, the Postal Administration changed the delivery of mail to sea vessels starting from the 2nd. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<h3>The Jin Army Cannot Advance South</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A Beiping telegram on the 2nd states: (1) Li Shucheng, who is inseparable from Feng Yuxiang, told reporters yesterday that Feng's attitude towards politics and military affairs is passive. (2) After Yan Xishan ordered the mobilization, he strongly urged the various troops to go south. In the past two days, Jidong, all roads have stopped advancing. The reasons are: 1. After the Yan telegram was issued, the various generals sent telegrams criticizing Yan for stealing and signing orders. 2. The Northwest Army has not yet reached a compromise with the Jin on the supply of funds and ammunition. 3. Zhang Xueliang in the Northeast has consistently not supported Yan's claims. (3) According to military sources, Yan ordered the Taiyuan Arsenal to rush to produce guns and ammunition, but due to a lack of materials, most of it has stopped. Yan's food and ammunition are not abundant. If he confronts the Central Army, he may not be able to gain an advantage. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Guo Rudong telegraphed Jiang, saying that after returning to his defense area from Beijing this time, he read various telegrams and learned that the reactionary elements from the north and south gathered in Shanxi province, advocating fallacies and slandering the Central Government. The Yan army has recently risked acting inappropriately, first offending western Shandong and openly rebelling, showing no regard for the Party and the country. If they are not severely punished, how can discipline be maintained? As a mere soldier, I only know to support the central government. If Your Excellency has any orders, I will be ready to fight.

<p>International Telegrams</p>
<p>]P&lt;Japan and the US Exchange Opinions at the London Conference&gt;P[</p>
<p>No Signs of Approaching Accord</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, London, 28th – After talking about the entirety of his negotiations with the American side, the Plenipotentiary said that the conference has not yet concluded. Regarding the so-called second proposal, the Americans made various proposals with figures, and the Japanese also responded with various figures. Given the nature of the issue, it is naturally impossible to expect a quick resolution. He cannot clearly state whether Japan is still adhering to 60% on eight-inch cruisers, or whether the total tonnage is more lenient than the first proposal. This is not an official meeting. He will continue to meet unofficially with the Americans, and the British will also hold unofficial meetings. Therefore, he will increasingly seek instructions from the government.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – Japanese Foreign Ministry authorities denied that the American side presented a second proposal at the meeting between Plenipotentiaries Matsudaira and Iida, and that Plenipotentiary Wakatsuki sought instructions from the government. They said that although it is rumored that the United States has a second proposal and that the Plenipotentiary is seeking instructions from the government, according to official telegrams received today, this news is inaccurate. There is no so-called second proposal. The meeting with Plenipotentiary Iida requested that the matter be put on hold until the French political situation stabilizes, and that the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan first hold unofficial meetings to seek progress in the conference. There have been several preparatory meetings to date. During these meetings, Japan and the United States have discussed various private proposals, but neither Japan nor the United States has put forward a second proposal that binds third countries. There is no glimmer of hope for the future today. Talk of negotiating to 60% is completely unfounded.</p>
<p>]P&lt;New French Cabinet Formed&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 2nd – Tardieu formed a new cabinet at 1 a.m. this morning, serving as Prime Minister and concurrently Minister of Interior. Briand serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Maginot as Minister of War, Dumensil as Minister of the Navy, Reynaud as Minister of Finance, and Piétri as Minister of Colonies. The delegation attending the London Naval Conference consists of Tardieu, Briand, Dumensil, Piétri, the French Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Fleuriau, and the Chairman of the Naval Committee of the Senate, Cogu.</p>
<h3>US Senator Suggests Shipping Wheat Flour to China for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 1st – Senator McMaster today introduced a proposal in the Senate advocating that the Central Agricultural Committee purchase wheat flour to be shipped to disaster areas in China for distribution. The amount to be purchased is limited to US$25 million, provided that the Chinese government agrees to repay the amount successively within ten years, with conditions deemed appropriate by the Agricultural Committee. The intent of this proposal is to replace the Nye proposal, which originally stipulated that the funds be allocated by the US Treasury Department, but this proposal never materialized. Senator McNary, Chairman of the Senate Agricultural Committee, highly praised McMaster's proposal and intends to publicly solicit opinions from all sectors next week. The reasons McMaster gave for his proposal are that it would solve the American agricultural problem and save millions of disaster victims in China. There are millions of starving women and children in China eagerly awaiting American assistance. Providing relief to neighboring disasters is an excellent policy for the United States, which would earn international goodwill and set a rare precedent for humanitarianism.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Du Xigui Left the UK Yesterday&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 2nd – Du Xigui, dispatched by the Chinese government to various countries to study naval affairs, left London today. Du told people that he had an audience with the British Emperor at Buckingham Palace several days ago. The Emperor expressed great interest in China and hoped that Sino-British friendship would always be good. Du also met with Prime Minister MacDonald, who asked him to convey a message to China, hoping that the United Kingdom and China would always have sympathetic understanding and cooperation in the progress of Chinese affairs. Du paid close attention to the training and equipment of the British Navy and intends to submit proposals to the Chinese government for gradually expanding the Chinese Navy.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Japanese Government Sets Tax Reduction Plan&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd – The Japanese government has officially decided to implement tax reductions in the Showa 6 fiscal year. During the preparation period, a new Tax System Investigation Committee will be established. Among the tax reduction items, the most notable are the reduction of consumption taxes on cloth and sugar and the reduction of business profit tax. In the profit tax, it is proposed to increase the current tax exemption point of 400 yuan in net profit, which is particularly noteworthy in terms of aiding small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists. The reduced income due to tax reductions will be compensated by reducing established expenses and cutting military spending. However, implementing tax reductions will inevitably encounter considerable difficulties.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Scandal Exposed</h3>
<p>Fujita Confesses to Bribery</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd – The new major scandal exposed by Fujita's confession was not immediately exposed by the prosecutor's office at the time because it coincided with the general election and could harm the election. Now, the Ministry has ordered all provinces to resolutely implement judicial action. Therefore, following last year's Showa Scandal, a new scandal has begun to unfold. Originally, wool had no tariffs, but after Fujita's lobbying, a tax of 14 yuan per 100 catties was levied. Jinbara, Fujita's right-hand man who participated in this lobbying, was imprisoned for breach of trust and embezzlement of funds from the Godo Wool Textile Company. Fujita, fearing that the secrets would be exposed, ordered his secretary to destroy evidence in the accounting books, but the act of destroying evidence was suddenly exposed. Fujita was arrested again. Knowing that there was no way to escape punishment, he confessed everything that had happened.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd – The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry approved Chairman Fujita's resignation yesterday.</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd – According to the confession of Fujita Kenichi, Chairman of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce before his re-arrest, the customs tariff scandal related to the 51st Diet has been exposed. Around the spring of Taisho 15, when the bill to buy off the Echigo Railway by Ko Hashi Kazuta was passed, there was a customs tariff amendment bill related to Fujita that passed the Diet at the same time. When Fujita, who was then the president of Tokyo Wool Textile, strongly lobbied the Diet and government agencies to raise wool tariffs, he spent approximately 200,000 yuan. Those who received bribes included members of the Constitutional Politics Association, the Seiyukai, and the Seiyu Honto, and it will also involve a certain high-ranking official of the Wakatsuki Cabinet at the time, becoming a new major scandal.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Inukai to Resign as President of the Seiyukai&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 1st – The reason for the Seiyukai's crushing defeat in the recent election is due to the undeniable fact that there was competition among various factions within the party and a lack of unity. President Inukai is most disgusted with this kind of internal strife and feels that there is no hope for the future, so he has decided to resign as president. He is scheduled to secretly meet with Tokonami Takeji and other individuals in Yugawara in the next day or two to discuss important arrangements. With a formidable enemy outside and internal infighting, the Seiyukai will face nothing but thorns both internally and externally.</p>
<p>]P&lt;The Difficulties of the Japanese Special Diet&gt;P[</p>
<p>In the Upper House, Not the Lower House</p>
<p>▲ Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd – Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who has been staying at home due to the general election, went to his villa in Kamakura again yesterday and told reporters who visited that increasing compulsory education expenses is not an expansion of the budget but a substantial reduction in taxes. Military spending cuts are being urgently reviewed by the Military and Political Affairs Investigation Committee. The FY4 implementation budget and the FY5 unestablished budget are planned to be implemented as promised. Whether or not to give the smaller parties the right to speak in the Special Diet has not yet become an issue. The difficulties of the Special Diet lie in the Upper House, not the Lower House.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Indian Railway Strike Resolved&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, New Delhi, 1st – The strike by 125,000 employees of the Indian Peninsula Railway has now been called off. The resolution stipulates that strikers shall not be penalized in any way, and the railway authorities must recognize several demands of the railway workers' union. The strike began on February 5th, initiated by railway workers demanding wage increases and improved treatment.</p>
<p>]P&lt;British Liberal Party and the Coal Mining Bill&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 1st – The Liberal Party newspaper, the Daily News, stated that the Liberal Party's amendment to the government's coal mining bill last Thursday was defeated by only nine votes. The government's victory was due to the fact that four Liberal Party members voted against their own party and in favor of the government, and eight members did not vote. Liberal Party leader George, in view of this failure, is likely to resign as party leader and has already discussed this with key members of the party yesterday. The Liberal Party will meet on Tuesday to consider this matter. However, regardless of the outcome, the actions of Liberal Party members who opposed their own party's resolution are bound to cause some repercussions. (Note: George has denied any intention to resign.)</p>
<p>]P&lt;British Ship Queen Scheduled for Launch&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 1st – A large new merchant ship built by the Changxing Shipping Company, named Queen, will be launched on May 28th. It is said that this ship can be a formidable rival to the German ship Bremen and will set a new speed record for the Atlantic route, as it will take less than five days from Southampton, England, to Quebec, Canada. This ship can be put into use early next year, and at that time, the voyage between the United Kingdom and Canada will be shortened by one and a half days. This ship has a capacity of 45,000 tons, which is 20,000 tons more than the merchant ships currently sailing to Quebec.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Spanish Government Denounces Guelra&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Madrid, 1st – The Spanish government has now issued an article denouncing the actions of Dr. Guelra and others, saying that while the government does not require the joint work of the entire populace, it cannot tolerate these people stirring up noisy demonstrations, which hinder the work of the peaceful populace. Now that the government's power to hold the head of state responsible for their actions has been restored, there is even less need to criticize systems that cannot be discussed. The government will not allow anyone to attack the head of state of the constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Gandhi Issues Letter of Grievance&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Ahmedabad, 1st – Nationalist leader Gandhi sent a letter of grievance to the Viceroy tonight. It is expected that non-violent resistance will begin in eight days.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Earthquake in California, USA&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, California, 1st – Ten successive earthquakes occurred here today, all of which were felt. Residents and shops suffered significant damage. The public is panicking and gathering in the open to avoid the collapse of walls. It is reported that four people have been injured. Although no houses have collapsed, many have been tilted by the earthquake.</p>
<p>]P&lt;American View on Philippine Independence&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 1st – The Senate has decided to include in the agenda of the next Philippine independence bill a letter from former Philippine Vice Governor-General Gilbert to Senator Bingham. In his letter, Gilbert claims that if the United States relinquishes sovereignty over the Philippines, the peace of the islands will be destroyed from then on. The result will be unexpected, or perhaps cause another war more intense than the European War among the countries of the world. Chinese will flow into the Philippines in a steady stream, which the independent Philippine government will not be able to stop. To stop the Chinese from approaching the shores of the Philippines, an army is required. This is beyond the power of the Philippines. Furthermore, once American sovereignty over the Philippines is abolished, the prosperity of the Philippines will be greatly affected. The island must first seek proper economic development before it can be politically independent, which cannot be achieved in fifty years.</p>
<p>]P&lt;Taft Slightly Improves&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Washington, 1st – Former President Taft's condition has slightly improved today. He is now able to speak a little. Doctors report that his pulse has also increased slightly.</p>
<p>]P&lt;President of International Bank Departs&gt;P[</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, New York, 1st – American banker McLarren, who will soon relinquish his position as President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, departed for Europe today aboard the Aquitania to assume the position of President of the International Bank in Basel, Switzerland. Accompanying him is the bank's director, Frazer. Also on board is the son of British Prime Minister MacDonald, who has been studying agriculture in the United States and will return home after a few months.</p>

<p>Important News</p>
<h3>Han Fuju and Shi Yousan's Joint Telegram Advocates Peace</h3>
<p>Han Fuju and Shi Yousan's joint telegram expressing the desire for peace was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. The full text of the original telegram is as follows: (Titles Omitted) We, believing that the purpose of national revolution is to first seek peaceful unification, is something everyone knows and everyone can say. However, since the founding of the Republic over nineteen years ago, while we speak of peace, the disasters of war have repeatedly arisen, and while we seek unification, the trend of division is worrying. As a result, the people have suffered greatly, and the nation is on the verge of collapse, which is truly heartbreaking to speak of. The Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander-in-Chief have repeatedly telegraphed to consult on national affairs, and the heads of various departments have also discussed among themselves, all adhering to peaceful unification, but the path to achieving this has not yet been agreed upon. We, Fuju and others, know we are simple and ignorant, and dare not make any claims. However, since joining the military, we have upheld the ambition of maintaining peace and supporting unification, and have never dared to change. In recent years, as Henan connects north and south, it is the first to bear the brunt of war, and the pain we have felt is the greatest. Therefore, we cannot help but speak out. After the success of the Northern Expedition, the vast land and rivers were unified. Those who control our military and civilian affairs are all great revolutionary figures and followers of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who are loyal to the country and diligently worry day and night, hoping to establish a foundation for the long-term stability of the party and state through peaceful unification. However, before long, A allied with B to attack C, and then before long, C supported B to attack A. The changes and divisions are unpredictable. These are all great figures of the party and state, who followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen in revolution for many years, upholding the last instructions to regard the world as public, and treating fellow comrades in adversity with sincerity. Even if opinions occasionally clash, there should be good strategies for resolution. Why resort to force, inviting the criticism of "boiling beans over a burning stalk"? We, Fuju and others, know that our talent is insufficient to save the situation, and our words are insufficient to move people. However, we have sworn to ourselves that even if the country cannot be governed by me, I will not allow it to be thrown into chaos by me, and even if the people cannot be brought to life by me, I will not allow them to die because of me. When the Northwest Army withdrew, I resolutely led my troops from Gansu back to Henan. Afterwards, during the outbreaks of battles in western Henan, I repeatedly requested to retire and return to my fields to avoid being drawn into the vortex and violating my original intention. The hardship of maintaining peace and supporting unification is evident in the facts and should be seen by all compatriots in the country. Moreover, after repeated wars, the country will inevitably sacrifice countless lives and consume countless properties. The result only harms the vitality of society and doubly promotes the death of the people, and there is no effect whatsoever in promoting peaceful unification. Instead, it plunges the country into a state of disintegration and division, and the personal position and power of individuals are also lost along with it. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, past events can all be reviewed. This can be said to be following the accumulated habits of warlords from the feudal era. This revolution was originally called for overthrowing warlords, so why imitate their old tricks when working hard, still seeking so-called unification through force? In the spirit of ruling the country with the party, the party headquarters truly holds the highest governing power. If national affairs are difficult and not easily resolved, it seems appropriate for the party headquarters to plan and decide on a solution. No one should stubbornly adhere to their own opinions, causing warfare. Now, the national military forces are divided, with factions killing each other, and mutually swallowing each other. How is this different from the warlords? The current national environment is such that negotiations with Soviet Russia are still in the air and not yet realized, and the abolition of unequal treaties with various countries is also urgently needed. Internally, bandits are rampant, with almost no inhabitants for hundreds of miles, and communists are rampant, with a county becoming a dark land. In addition, after the ravages of war, villages have become ruins, and in disaster areas, refugees are on the roads. The national authorities must exhaust their spirit and wisdom to plan construction, still fearing the successive external troubles and the incessant internal worries, let alone engaging in fratricidal strife and using armed force to promote peace. It will not achieve its purpose. In this era of the strong preying on the weak, the collapse of the country is likely to occur at any time. We, Fuju and others, humbly possess meager talents and are wrongly entrusted with heavy responsibilities. We are ashamed of having no "sun-reversing spears" but wish to be "stones for patching up the sky." If there is another way to maintain peace besides force, so that scholars can be at ease with their studies, merchants can be at ease with their businesses, workers can focus on manufacturing, farmers can do their best to cultivate, and soldiers can be trained into a disciplined force to defend the local area and resist foreign invasions, and the party and the state can complete unification from then on, establishing a foundation for lasting peace and stability, even if I were to sacrifice myself, I would swear to follow their example and strive to serve. We respectfully submit our humble words, hoping that you will carefully consider them and await your clear instructions. Han Fuju and Shi Yousan respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3>Report on the Work of the Central Executive Committee</h3>
<p>▲ Submitted to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee (Continued)</p>
<p>(D) Newly Dispatched Personnel to Organize or Prepare Party Branches: (1) Ordinary Domestic Party Branches: Yunnan Province originally only had registration officers. Now, seven guiding committee members have been dispatched to organize. (2) Special Party Branches: Five preparatory committee members were dispatched to the Ping-Sui Railway; five preparatory committee members to the Wu-Chang-Zhu-Ping Railway; seven preparatory committee members to the Army University; and seven preparatory committee members to the Wuhan Branch of the Central Military Academy. (E) Party Branches that Have Been Abolished: (1) The original 4th, 15th, 16th, 17th, 23rd, 25th, 26th, 27th, 28th, 45th, 51st, and 53rd Divisions of the Army, as well as the 2nd and 4th Group Armies, were all considered reactionary troops. The special party branches of these armies and divisions were uniformly abolished by the 76th Standing Committee meeting on February 24th of this year. (2) The original 34th, 44th, and 52nd Divisions of the Army, as well as the 22nd Army, have all been reorganized. The special party branches of these armies and divisions were also abolished by the same meeting. (F) Changes in the Names or Affiliations of Party Branches: (1) Special Party Branches: The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Branch was renamed the Beijing-Shanghai-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Special Party Branch due to a change in the railway's name. (2) Overseas Party Branches: The Tahiti Branch, originally under the Australian General Branch, was renamed the Direct Subordinate Branch in French Tahiti because its location was a French territory. The San Francisco General Branch, because it had jurisdiction over the entire United States, was renamed the United States General Branch as its name did not match its function. (G) According to the regulations of the Second National Party Affairs Implementation Plan, designated local party branches to assign the work of executive committee members: (1) Provincial Party Branches: The heads of the organization, propaganda, and training departments of Hebei, Yunnan, Sichuan, Hunan, and other provinces were all successively appointed by the Central Government. (2) Special Party Branches: The organization, propaganda, and training committee members of the Preparatory Committee of the Beijing-Ningbo Railway Special Party Branch were appointed by the Central Government. (H) Dispatching Personnel for Inspection and Guidance: Committee Member Wang Bailing was dispatched to inspect the Yunnan Party Branch, and Committee Member He Yingqin was dispatched to guide party affairs in Henan from nearby.</p>
<p>(4) Regulations on Party Membership Procedures and Enlistment of Probationary Party Members: After the purification of the party, our party immediately held a general registration of party members, and therefore temporarily suspended new party membership recruitment. Since the Third National Congress, local party branches have gradually been organized and put in order, and it is appropriate to start recruiting party members to absorb people who believe in the party's doctrines and to strengthen the party's power. However, the Third National Congress amended the party's general charter, which stipulated that party members be divided into two types: party members and probationary party members. All party membership procedures should therefore be re-regulated. The 27th Standing Committee meeting on July 25th of last year approved six articles on party membership procedures and the application form and introduction letter for party membership. Furthermore, considering that the situations of the local party branches were different, the 28th Standing Committee meeting on August 1st decided to hand this over to the Organization Department to draft the order of implementation. Subsequently, the 30th Standing Committee meeting on August 15th approved eight articles on the implementation measures for enlisting probationary party members. After this, the recruitment of probationary party members by local party branches was gradually approved based on the implementation measures, and their recruitment periods were stipulated. Counting from the 44th Standing Committee meeting on October 28th of last year, the party branches that were successively approved to recruit probationary party members included domestic party branches in Zhejiang (five months), Henan (five months), Qingdao (three months), Shanghai (three months), Tianjin (two months), Beiping (two months), Shanxi (five months) and other provinces and cities, as well as the Beijing-Ningbo Railway Special Party Branch (one month) and the District Party Branch of the Central Political School (only 63 students who had not joined the party); and overseas general branches in Honolulu (four months), the Dutch East Indies (six months), Australia (six months), Mexico (six months), the Philippines (six months) and other general branches, as well as branches in Lima (four months), Korea (three months), Liverpool (three months), Hanoi (four months) and other branches.</p>
<p>(5) Emphasis on Propaganda and Expansion of Propaganda Work: Propaganda work has always been valued by our party. The Second Plenary Session's Party Affairs Implementation Plan once stipulated that party doctrine propaganda was one of the main tasks. In the past few months, due to the last struggle of all reactionary forces in the country, they rose up to plot rebellion. In addition, the Middle East Road Incident occurred, and the Red Russians invaded, making propaganda work even more urgent. In addition to supervising the Propaganda Department and party branches at all levels to step up their work, the Standing Committee has taken the following measures regarding propaganda: (1) Propaganda for Special Events: The Propaganda Department was instructed to guide party branches at all levels to step up propaganda on events such as the suppression of rebels, the Middle East Road Incident, and the abolition of consular jurisdiction, and announcements were issued to all party members and the people of the country one after another. (2) Regulations on Emphasizing Propaganda Work in Remote Provinces and Regions: In remote provinces and regions, where the people are not well-informed, the progress of party affairs depends on propaganda as a guide. Therefore, the "Measures for Promoting Party Affairs in Remote Provinces and Regions" passed by the 63rd Standing Committee meeting on January 9th of this year stipulated that party affairs work in remote provinces and regions should emphasize propaganda, and stipulated that its funding should account for one-third of the total funding of the party branch. (3) Expansion of the Central Broadcasting Radio Station: Radio stations transmit information quickly and have a great effect in terms of propaganda. Since its opening, its performance has been good, but because the power is too small, it cannot be popularized throughout the country. Before the Second Plenary Session, it had already been decided to expand the plan, and Committee Members Chen Guofu and Ye Chuqiang were appointed to be responsible for the preparations. The 18th Standing Committee meeting on June 24th of last year decided to use 50 kilowatt power, and the equipment cost was increased to 600,000 yuan. The German company Telefunken has been selected to undertake the machinery. After the expansion, central news can be transmitted to the whole country and neighboring countries at any time.</p>
<p>(6) Training of Party Members: In order to make all party members become sound revolutionary elements and to give full play to the power of the party, the training of party members is essential. The resolution on the party affairs report of the Third National Congress clearly pointed out the importance of training work and the shortcomings of the past, as well as the future direction. In accordance with the spirit of the Congress, the Committee must pay special attention to the training of party members. The following is a brief list of the important matters in terms of training: (1) Determining the Standards of Party Spirit and Party Ethics: Our Party is burdened with the great mission of the Three Principles of the People, which must be aided by a great revolutionary force. This great revolutionary force must be sought in the unity of all party members, and the unity of party members must be sought in the party spirit and party ethics that party members should abide by. The Third National Congress once determined the principle of (party spirit and party ethics must be publicized and trained for party members) in the resolution on the party affairs report. In order to put this principle into practice, the (Standards of Party Spirit and Party Ethics) proposal was passed at the 26th Standing Committee meeting on July 22nd of last year. The meaning and standards of party spirit and party ethics were correctly defined as the criteria for propaganda and training. (2) Determining the Basic Principles of Probationary Party Member Training: The Third National Congress amended the General Charter, dividing party members into two types: party members and probationary party members. Its significance lies in allowing new party members to receive basic party training first, so as to become loyal and sound party members, and to examine their past and present thoughts and actions. Since the promulgation of the party membership procedures, the recruitment of probationary party members has been implemented. The implementation of this probationary party member training is extremely important. Therefore, the (Basic Principles of Probationary Party Member Training) was passed at the 46th Standing Committee meeting, as the basis for the training program. (3) Sending Party Members to Study Abroad: According to the resolution of the Second Session of the Fifth Plenary Session, the Second Standing Committee formulated the Regulations for the Relief of Revolutionary Youths Who Have Lost Their Studies, the purpose of which is to enable comrades who have lost their studies due to the revolution to have the opportunity to continue their studies, and to cultivate outstanding party members in order to take on construction work in the future. There is a provision for (selecting those who have a foundation in learning and sending them to study in various countries). Since the promulgation of the aforementioned regulations, there have been many requests for funding to study abroad. Therefore, the (Measures for Funding Revolutionary Youths to Study Abroad) was passed at the 26th Standing Committee meeting on July 22nd of last year, and an examination committee was organized to implement the examination. Subsequently, at the 60th Standing Committee meeting on December 26th, it was approved to admit 70 party members, and at the same meeting, it was approved to establish a management committee for students studying abroad to be responsible for management. All the admitted students began to be sent abroad in February of this year.</p>
<p>(7) Improvement of Mass Training: The Third National Congress has clearly determined the principles of the mass movement in the future. In order to realize the principles shown by the Congress, the Second Plenary Session also formulated the organizational plan of people's organizations. The shortcomings of the past mass movement have indeed become an undeniable fact, and in the period of political tutelage, training the masses to devote themselves to the cause of construction is very different from leading the masses to carry out destructive work in the period of military administration. The improvement of mass training is essential. The Standing Committee has only followed the above-mentioned principles and plans for lower-level party branches and people's organizations to guide the path of their work, and because the organizations of the old people's organizations mostly could not meet the principles determined by the Congress and the purpose of the plenary session's plan, the 35th Standing Committee meeting on September 12th of last year decided to urge the Legislative Yuan to quickly formulate laws and regulations on the organization of people's organizations. Subsequently, in terms of merchant organizations, the new Chamber of Commerce Law and the Industrial and Commercial Guild Law have been formulated and promulgated by the government, and the organization of the old Merchant and People's Association has obviously become inapplicable. Therefore, at the 70th Standing Committee meeting on February 3rd of this year, it was decided to abolish the Regulations on the Organization of Merchant and People's Associations promulgated in the 17th year of the Republic of China, and the Merchant and People's Associations in various places were ordered to end their operations within a time limit. The original members of the Merchant and People's Association were given the opportunity to participate in the Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial and Commercial Guild according to their respective natures. Furthermore, the organizations of student groups and women's groups in the past had more drawbacks and urgently needed to be reformed, while cultural groups still had no laws and regulations to follow. In order to implement the principles shown by the Third National Congress (the Party should make every effort to create an autonomous life within schools for men and women and young people in the future, implement universal physical education for men and women, promote scientific and artistic gatherings, societies, publications and awards, and research and invention of practical science), the 67th Standing Committee meeting on January 23rd of this year passed the organizational principles and organizational outlines and other laws and regulations of student, women, and cultural groups, as the basis for reorganizing various groups.</p>
<p>(8) Prevention of Reaction and Implementation of Discipline: Since the Third National Congress, the party's foundation has become increasingly consolidated. All reactionary elements, such as the Communist Party, the Nationalists, and the Reorganization Faction, although at the end of their rope, still did not give up their ambition to create trouble and sabotage by any means possible. In order to curb the chaos and eliminate reaction, the Party had no choice but to strictly prevent and control, and repeatedly formulated plans and issued them to party branches at all levels for compliance. The 41st Standing Committee meeting resolved to issue a general order to strictly report all reactionary elements. Although it has not been possible to completely eliminate them in the past few months, their conspiracies have not succeeded. As for party branches or party members who violate discipline or are instructed by the enemy and openly resist the Central Government, they are given strict sanctions at any time. What is regrettable is that some people who have a long history in the Party and have served in the Central Government, or who are deeply poisoned by the Communist Party, or who are obsessed with their own private interests, have also abandoned their faith and fallen into the path of reaction. The Central Government still maintained leniency when their rebellious actions were not obvious, hoping that they would repent. Unexpectedly, these people went astray and did not return, and their conspiracies became increasingly fierce, so they had to be resolutely dealt with in order to maintain discipline. For example, Wang Faqin, Bai Wenwei, Zhu Jiqing, Bai Yunti, Wang Leping, Gu Mengyu, Chen Shuren, Pan Yunchao, and Guo Chuntao were all members of the Second Central Committee, but they colluded with the remnants of warlords, falsely claimed their names, wantonly incited, and plotted to undermine reorganization, subvert the Party and the country, and willingly become tools of red imperialism. Their various conspiracies have been clearly investigated and confirmed. The 39th Standing Committee meeting on October 3rd of last year decided to hand them over to the government for arrest, and sent them to the Central Supervisory Committee for discussion. Subsequently, at the 52nd Standing Committee meeting on November 28th, in accordance with the resolution of the Supervisory Committee, they were all permanently expelled from the party. Wang Zhaoming was formerly relied upon by the Premier and respected by his comrades. Recently, he went astray and became increasingly depraved. He condoned the troops in Guangdong in previous years, causing a communist change, which was already inexcusable. The Third National Congress generously tolerated him and only gave him a warning. However, he still did not repent. During the Zhang Gui rebellion, he secretly returned to Hong Kong to preside over the conspiracy. The rebellion of Shi Tang was all initiated by him. He went so far as to act perversely and recklessly. The party branches in various places have repeatedly reported his crimes. The 56th Standing Committee meeting on December 12th of last year decided that it was no longer possible to condone him. It was decided to expel him from the party and arrest him, and send him to the Supervisory Committee for review. Subsequently, at the 68th Standing Committee meeting on December 19th, in accordance with the resolution of the Supervisory Committee, he was permanently expelled from the party. Furthermore, Lu Zhonglin and Xue Dubi, both alternate members of the Central Committee, opposed the Central Government and obstructed reorganization because they sided with Feng Yuxiang. The 61st Standing Committee meeting on December 30th of last year also resolved to permanently expel them from the party in accordance with the resolution of the Supervisory Committee, and resolved to remove them from their positions as alternate members of the Central Executive Committee. In addition, Xu Chongzhi, Zou Lu, Ju Zheng, Xie Chi, and others were also plotting to revolt and endanger the Party and the country. The 56th Standing Committee meeting on December 12th of last year decided to hand them over to the government for arrest.</p>
<p>(9) Handling of Standing Committee Meetings and Daily Affairs: Standing Committee meetings were usually held twice a week. In July of last year, it was changed to once a week, and in October, it was restored to twice a week. Counting from June 20th of last year, after the closing of the Second Plenary Session, to the end of February of this year, a total of 56 regular meetings and 4 temporary meetings were held, totaling 60 meetings (from the 17th to the 77th). As for the handling of daily affairs, in addition to the affairs within the scope of the Secretariat, which are handled by the Secretary-General, those that the Secretariat cannot decide are reported to the Standing Committee members by the Secretary-General at any time. Later, due to the responsibility being too focused, it was felt to be inconvenient. The 43rd Standing Committee meeting decided that Standing Committee members should take turns working in the department. Two committee members would take turns on duty every day, go to the department at a fixed time to read documents, and decide on incidents reported by various departments, offices, and meetings at any time. Since its implementation, it has been more convenient and efficient for the progress of affairs.</p>
<p>The above is a selective description of the work of the Standing Committee in the past eight months. In addition, the various departments, offices, and meetings of the Central Government and the Political Conference will have more detailed reports on the various aspects of party affairs and politics.</p>
<h3>Large Soviet Russian Army Approaches Manchurian Station</h3>
<p>▲ The Front Line Advances to a Small Station 18 Li Away</p>
<p>▲ Airplanes Also Circle Our Borders</p>
<p>▲ Russian Consul Claims It Is to Defend Against the White Army</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: At 9:10 AM on February 23rd, six Soviet aircraft took off from Abagaitui Tuteng outside the Manchurian border, circled several times outside Zhalannuoer, then flew to the small station 18 li away from the Sino-Russian border, circling back and forth. The aircraft flew very low, and the rattling of the engines could be heard in the city of Manchurian Station. They departed towards Dalinori about half an hour later. On the morning of the previous day, several of their aircraft also flew around in the same manner, causing great panic among the citizens of Manchurian Station. Furthermore, on the morning of the 23rd, the Russian army fired artillery into the air at the small station 18 li away, and the rumbling sound caused the merchants of Manchurian Station to be frightened and close their doors. The sound of artillery lasted for about an hour before stopping. At noon, the merchants saw that nothing was happening and dared to open their stores. At 6:00 AM on the 24th, machine guns were fired at the border for half an hour, and three airplanes circled Xiaobeishan in our territory for a week. The merchants had not opened their stores by noon. Liang Zhongjia sent personnel to inquire with the Russian consul stationed in Manchurian Station about the matter. The consul replied that it was a military exercise. However, according to secret military reports, the Russian army transported the 34th Division, with a total of about 10,000 people, from the direction of Chita on the coast of the Sea of Japan to Dalinori, the small station 18 li away, and other places. There are about two battalions of artillery stationed on the Sino-Russian border. Together with the 35th Division originally stationed there, the Russian army on the border has reached more than 20,000 people. More than 20 armored vehicles are parked at Dalinori Station and have not returned to the interior. What is the intention? It is difficult to fathom. At noon on the 24th, the local Governor's Office, upon the request of the Commander of the Railway Protection Army, sent Xue Yong, the chief of the Foreign Affairs Section, to inquire with the Russian consul in Harbin, Melnikov, about the actual situation. The Russian consul said that he himself did not know much about it. He estimated that it was a troop rotation and a defense against the White Army's intrusion into Chinese territory. For this reason, our authorities have telegraphed a special report to the highest military authorities of the three northeastern provinces. As for Liang Zhongjia's brigade of our army, except for the 43rd and 51st Regiments, which have been reorganized, with Wang Yongsheng still serving as the commander of the 43rd Regiment and Gao Yunpeng as the commander of the 51st Regiment, the mortar, machine gun, anti-aircraft gun, and mountain gun companies, as well as the 38th Regiment, have not been replenished. The actual number of people in the brigade is less than 4,000. In addition, two battalions have been allocated to be stationed in Zhalannuoer and Hailar (Liang Zhongjia also serves as the commander of the Manchurian-Hailar garrison). The troops stationed in Manchurian Station have not received enough guns and ammunition, and the military strength is weak. If something happens, the situation is extremely critical. Furthermore, the Russian consulate in Manchurian Station has recently opened for more than 100 troops, carrying weapons, and stationed downstairs in the consulate. Russian troops outside the border enter the city in groups of ten every day to search for White Russians, coming and going freely, and disregarding our national sovereignty. Liang Zhongjia negotiated with the Russian consul, but the Russian consul ignored him. It is not known what the Russian side intends. (February 24th)</p>
<h3>The Guangdong Province Levis One Month's Rent and Taxes</h3>
<p>▲ Guangzhou City Rent and Taxes Must Be Collected Within 20 Days</p>
<p>▲ Recent New Regulations for National and Provincial Tax Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, due to the urgent need to raise funds in Guangdong Province, it was decided to levy one month's rent and taxes in Guangzhou City. Starting today (26th), the levying has begun. The procedures for levying are handled by the Public Security Bureau, which instructs the various branch bureaus to send police officers to cooperate with the tax collectors to levy taxes from door to door every month. The rent is paid in advance by the tenants, and the receipts are returned to the landlords to offset the rent. The landlords can take the levy receipts to the Central Bank to redeem cash after eight months. The deadline for this levy is very tight, and all levies must be completed within 20 days (i.e., from the 26th to the 17th of March). If payment is made more than one month after the deadline, a fine of one-tenth of the levy amount will be imposed, and the fine will be increased to a multiple of one time the levy. The Finance Department and the Public Security Bureau have jointly issued a notice to the citizens to inform them of this. In order to maintain tax revenue, the national treasury and the provincial treasury have been collecting full cash since February 19th, and an additional levy has been added. The new revenue and expenditure measures for national and provincial taxes are as follows: (1) All national and provincial tax revenues, originally collected in silver at 60%, paper money at 50%, or silver plus 0.05 military expenses, will now be collected in full in silver coins, plus an additional levy. (2) Various taxes, such as salt tax, cigarette tax, defense association tax, provincial river prohibition tax (foreign prohibition tax is collected with an additional levy), and contract paper price, which have always been collected in full in silver coins, will still be collected in full as before, without the need for an additional levy. Furthermore, military supply treasury bonds and loans, originally collected in silver at 60% and paper money at 40%, will be temporarily collected as verified. (3) New and old land taxes, deed taxes, official property, land reclamation, business licenses, sand taxes, sand protection taxes, land surveying and registration, and other taxes in various counties, which have always been collected entirely in Central Bank paper money, will now also be collected in full in silver coins, but there is no need for an additional levy. (4) In the four districts of Chaozhou, Meizhou, Qinlian in this province, which have always been areas where place name bonds are collected, in addition to the above two and three points, they should still collect ten parts of place name bonds, plus an additional levy. (5) Merchants undertaking various tax and duty matters who paid advance funds before January 16th, which were 80% silver and 20% paper, and deducted from the formal payment after February 19th, should pay an additional 30% in silver coins and return 20% of the unredeemed paper money. Those who paid advance funds between January 16th and February 8th, which were 60% in paper money and 50% in unredeemed paper money, and deducted from the formal payment after February 19th, will have 50% of the unredeemed paper money returned and 50% converted to silver coins. If the 60% silver coins and 50% paper money paid after February 8th have already been redeemed, they will be allowed to be deducted in full and there is no need to change them in order to save procedures. If the payment of additional funds was originally collected in full in silver coins and should be deducted from the formal payment after February 19th, an additional silver coin must be paid. (6) Merchants undertaking artillery expenses borrowed too much advance funds and cannot be returned according to the previous method. It was previously changed to pay an additional 10% of the original amount from January 16th to the date of cancellation of the 60% silver and 50% paper money method. From January 16th to February 7th, an additional 10% of paper money will be paid. After February 8th, an additional 10% of silver coins will be paid and remitted to the treasury monthly. It will still be handled as before, but the payment of this 10% additional fee should also be changed to end on the date of cancellation of the additional levy. (7) If there are any outstanding payments before February 10th, all silver coins or 80% silver and 40% paper, 80% silver and 20% paper, 60% paper money and 50% unredeemed paper money, or 60% silver coins and 50% paper money are due within the period, they should still be calculated and paid accordingly. (8) For the interest supplement item, calculate the interest supplement according to the period of 80% silver and 40% paper, 80% silver and 20% paper, 60% paper money and 50% unredeemed paper money, or 60% silver coins and 50% paper money. After February 19th, if the full silver coins plus an additional levy are collected, the interest supplement will also be calculated. As for the expenditure aspect: (1) The expenses of various agencies, whether regular or temporary, will be paid in redeemed paper money from February 1st. Whether or not to add treasury bonds will be handled separately. (2) The revenue of the four districts of Chaozhou, Meizhou, Qinlian will be in place name bonds, and the expenditure will also be paid in place name bonds in order to be uniform. (3) The agencies commissioned to handle affairs are allowed to deduct the agreed-upon amount as expenses according to the amount collected. However, the additional levy cannot be deducted. (4) The funds added to the various taxes will be earmarked for the Bank of China fund and should be remitted separately with a special document in order to emphasize the treasury funds.

<h3>Investigation of the Construction Costs of the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway</h3>
<p>The Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway, from the capital to the Zhejiang border, is 320 li long. Construction began in December of the 17th year of the Republic of China and was completed in October of the 18th year of the Republic of China. The roadbed, bridges, and culverts of the entire road have been completed, and the crushed stone pavement of the Tangshan to Jurong section has also been completed on time. The entire road is now open to traffic. However, because the project took a long time, all the costs of materials, transportation, salaries of employees, and miscellaneous expenses totaled about 1.2 million yuan. Now, the Jiangsu Construction Department has received the project cost calculation report of the road from the road construction office. According to the 140th Departmental Affairs Meeting, it was decided to send Secretary Jiang Kesheng and Chai E, Section Chiefs Kang Shizhen, Liu Menghao, and Wu Xiaoyuan, and Technician Wang Pu to organize a clearing committee. The first clearing meeting was held yesterday. The items were first allocated. Kang will investigate the construction costs of the Jurong-Lishui-Yixing section and the Tangshan-Jurong section. Liu will investigate project miscellaneous expenses. Wu will investigate recruitment expenses. Jiang, Chai, and Wang will investigate purchase expenses. After the group investigations are completed, each will sign their opinions, and then they will be summarized and reviewed.</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Strictly Prevents Churches from Promoting Religion in Schools</p>
<p>▲Circular to Education Departments and Bureaus in all Provinces and Cities for Verification</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education, in order to strictly prevent schools established by church groups from forcibly promoting religion through education, has specially instructed education departments and bureaus in various provinces and special cities as follows: In response to a letter from the Secretariat of the Central Executive Committee, the investigation into the matter of banning church schools has already been dealt with by your ministry, with the establishment of registration, Chinese principals, and restrictions on reading the Bible, and replies have been approved and filed. However, in the past year, reports from various places about documents of church schools causing unrest have not diminished slightly. Upon careful examination of the reasons, one is that the aforementioned measures do not seem to pay much attention to the content of church schools, and the other is that church schools mostly comply in appearance but defy in reality. Now, the Standing Committee has submitted the Zhejiang Provincial Executive Committee's transfer of the Jinhua County Executive Committee's request for strict prohibition of church schools to prevent cultural aggression, etc. It has been approved, combined with the aforementioned opinions, and transferred to the Ministry of Education for proper handling. In addition to the reply, the original letter is specially inspected and requested for verification and handling. It has been noted that private schools established by religious groups must not engage in religious propaganda and must not make religious subjects compulsory. The ministry has repeatedly ordered this. Now, in accordance with the previous request, the following points are strictly inspected for church schools that have not yet been registered: (1) Whether party ideology education is effectively implemented, and whether all party ideology teachers and directors of moral education have been certified. (2) Whether secondary schools and above comply with regulations by not making religious subjects compulsory, and whether there is any coercion in selecting elective subjects. (3) Elementary schools do not have so-called elective subjects, but whether there is still the reality of taking religious subjects under the name of elective subjects. (4) Whether students are forced to participate in religious ceremonies outside of class. If any of the above situations are discovered, they should be immediately prohibited in order to emphasize education and preserve national character. This is the order.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Urges Aurora University to Register</h3>
<p>▲ Instructing the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education to Comply</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The Ministry of Education instructed the Shanghai Special Municipality Bureau of Education: "The Ministry has previously learned that the Shanghai Private Aurora University has a preparatory course in the capital. As the university has not yet been approved for registration, the contents of its preparatory course are not known in detail. Furthermore, according to reports, the school has recently experienced severe turmoil. The Nanjing Special Municipality Bureau of Education was ordered to send personnel to investigate. The Bureau's report stated that the school's turmoil was described entirely by the school's foreign vice-president, Father Mu, and was feared to be one-sided. They attempted to find students to inquire with, but could not find a single person at the time, thus it was impossible to know who was right and who was wrong. Upon investigating the school's administrative content, it was discovered that it was during the winter break and only a copy of the school's charter could be obtained for reference. The school's charter, regarding its organization, administration, curriculum, and other aspects, does not comply with the current education system and educational regulations." A copy of the Aurora University preparatory course charter in Nanjing was also attached to the Ministry. Upon reviewing the preparatory course charter, many aspects were found to be non-compliant. It is appropriate for the Bureau to instruct the university to promptly prepare forms in accordance with the Regulations for Private Schools, and submit them for registration, in order to conduct a thorough examination. This is the order; please comply."</p>
<h3>Report on the Work of the Municipal Bureau of Education at the Sixth Municipal Congress (Part One)</h3>

<p>The various tasks of the Municipal Bureau of Education in the past year are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Completed tasks</p>
<p>(A) Regarding school education</p>
<p>(1) Implementing the Three People's Principles education: The Party Affairs education in each school and the Directors of Military Training are of utmost importance. The Municipal Party Headquarters jointly held three examinations for Party Affairs teachers in primary and secondary schools. 57 Party Affairs teachers from secondary schools and 155 Party Affairs teachers from primary schools passed the examination. The municipal public and private schools were repeatedly ordered to give priority to hiring these qualified teachers. Currently, all municipal and approved private schools in this city no longer have unqualified Party Affairs teachers. In order to promote the theoretical development and practical teaching of the Three People's Principles education, the Party Affairs teachers of each school were convened to hold discussions on Party Affairs education, and regulations for Party Affairs education were established. On-site inspections were conducted, and personnel were dispatched to participate in the weekly memorial service for the Premier to provide on-site guidance. (2) Preparing for compulsory education in stages: In the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), 134 township primary schools in 14 districts and counties were taken over. The names were changed, the number of grades was appropriately increased, and more children in townships and districts were given the opportunity to study. Regulations for free education were also promulgated and approved, and school fees were reduced to allow poor children to receive compulsory education. The implementation of compulsory education and the collection of school fees in municipal schools can be planned and taken care of concurrently.</p>
<p>(3) Establishing kindergartens in districts: Before this, only Xicheng Elementary School had an attached kindergarten. Last year, efforts were made to develop kindergartens, and kindergartens were added to Tangwan, Nanxun, Shangwen, Xunyu, and Cangji Elementary Schools, with excellent results. Plans were also formulated to open a larger kindergarten each in Huna and Zhabei, and to attach a teacher training institute for kindergartens. The site for the Zhabei kindergarten has been designated at Ziyuan Road in Ziyuan Garden and is already being prepared for opening. (4) Establishing experimental elementary schools: The original plan was to open two experimental elementary schools. Due to the lack of suitable school buildings, only the First Experimental Elementary School was established. To ensure that the name matches the reality, starting from the 18th year of the Republic (1929), only gifted children were admitted to receive special education. The school was also moved to the municipal public school grounds on Wenmiao Road, where the school buildings and scenery are more suitable.</p>
<p>(5) Reorganizing private schools: Previously, in order to understand the number and general situation of private schools in this city, a registration of private schools was carried out, and schools were ordered to apply for registration in accordance with the regulations. However, the number of schools that came to the Bureau for registration was still not many, so 40 staff members were dispatched to divide the area, conduct investigations, and review them separately. The first batch of 25 schools that should be shut down has been reviewed and approved, and the Public Security Bureau, the Temporary Court, and the French Concession Public Court have been requested to seal them up. The newspapers were also requested not to publish the schools' enrollment advertisements, and the names of the schools were published in the newspapers. As for those that have been approved for registration, there are 56 primary schools, 37 secondary schools, 41 primary schools that are on a trial basis, 10 secondary schools, 30 primary schools that are being improved, and 2 secondary schools.</p>
<p>(6) Improving private universities: There are many private universities in this city. Those that have been registered include Hujiang, Guanghua, Daxia, Datong, and other schools. Schools such as Far East, Chunshen, and East Asia lack both material and spiritual resources, and have been ordered to close down to prevent further harm. In addition, turmoil occurred in universities such as Jianshe University and the College of Political Science and Law. Personnel were dispatched to investigate and deal with these situations in a timely manner.</p>
<p>(7) Organizing summer research institutes, educational research associations, and travel observation groups for teachers: (1) In order to promote the professional development of teachers and staff, a three-week summer workshop was held to conduct a substantial and concrete exploration of the theory and implementation of teaching. (2) The Primary School Education Research Association and teaching discussion groups were organized to explore the basic principles of teaching and the special problems of education in this city. (3) Forty teachers and staff from municipal primary schools and two inspectors from the Bureau organized an observation group to visit Beijing, Hangzhou, and other places to study primary school education for reference.</p>
<p>(8) Organizing the Boy Scouts: According to current requirements, the Party Boy Scouts should be promoted and organized, and the Central Party Headquarters should take overall command. The Bureau has allocated funds to prepare the necessary equipment in stages and establish the scouts in phases.</p>
<p>(9) Investigating school-age children in the city: Investigating school-age children is a preparation for the implementation of compulsory education. The city has completed the investigation, and the statistical tables have been submitted to the Ministry of Education.</p>
<p>(10) Handling the registration of primary school education: Primary school teachers have been registered three times. Those who have passed the review in accordance with the registration regulations have been issued registration certificates.</p>

<h3>Lehua Comes from Behind to Defeat Huosaisi</h3>
<p>▲ Result: 4 to 3</p>
<p>Lehua defeated Huosaisi 4 to 3 yesterday in the Group A match. This greatly exceeded the expectations of the nearly 10,000 spectators in Shenyuan. When they were in despair at 0 to 3, they rallied and worked hard to develop their game. With sincerity, they were able to come from behind and defeat Huosaisi. As their reputation was restored, their fearless spirit was admirable.</p>
<p>▲ Zhou Xianyan's Contributions Outstanding</p>
<p>Although Lehua won, most of the time, they were under pressure from the opposing team. Zhou Xianyan was in the thick of it, using his superb skills to turn danger into safety. The loss of three goals was not due to his dereliction of duty. He was able to defend the goal thoroughly and prevent any further goals from being lost. His outstanding contributions led to this. Therefore, regardless of whether Lehua won on the day, his great work was already shining brightly.</p>
<h3>Li Huitang's Intelligence and Skill Surpass Others</h3>
<p>The absence of Lehua's three major generals, Feng Yunyou, Li Ning, and Dai Linjing, understandably weakened their strength. Once again, they were faced with Huosaisi, who had defeated Weidesi 3 to 2 to win the Senior Cup Championship. Captain Li felt it was difficult to deal with. After much deliberation, he initially planned to focus on defense and stay in the inner guard position himself. This was not effective, and two goals were lost. Starting in the second half, he changed his plan and coordinated from the center, taking on the duties of the central defender, but still to no avail, and another goal was lost. He changed his strategy for the third time, focusing on offense and taking the left inner position, hoping for success through attack. From then on, the forwards were powerful, the opposing team was surprised, and Lehua felt that the pressure was reduced. As a result, they sailed smoothly and achieved success. If Captain Li had not been intelligent and skillful, and adaptable to the situation, there would have been no hope of victory. However, we can resolutely conclude that Li Huitang should no longer hold an important inner position, as he has cut off his own path to advancement. Yesterday's victory is proof of this.</p>
<h3>Chen Yutian's Skills Greatly Improved</h3>
<p>Chen Yutian's skills have greatly improved recently and he has become an important and indispensable figure among Lehua's forwards. Every time he plays, he makes a significant contribution to Lehua. In the first half of yesterday's game, Chen was the only dangerous player among Lehua's forwards, providing three excellent passes, but unfortunately, there was no one to receive them, and all ended without results. Only after Li Huitang took on the left inner position was he able to achieve success. Chen was also a major contributor to Lehua's victory. In addition, Wang Yongjie's performance yesterday was much better than before. The rest of the players showed both strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>▲ Lehua Team Lineup (Last One)</p>
<p>Wang Xiongjie</p>
<p>Hu Minteng, Chen Zhenhe, Li Huitang Zhou Xianyan, Sun Sijing, Chen Jiaqiu, Jiang Shanjing, Chen Pu, Chen Yutian, Xi Qiaosheng</p>
<p>▲ Huosaisi Lineup</p>
<p>Mao Di</p>
<p>Bo Nattuo, Shi Mishi, Xiao Shi Pinque, Huo Jin Sheng, Shi Denglai, Lang Shi</p>
<p>Aigedun, Shi Pante, Tang En</p>
<p>▲ Huosaisi's Raucous Momentum</p>
<p>At the start of the fierce battle, Lehua's Feng Yunyou, Li Ning, and Dai Linjing were all absent, replaced by Jiang Shanjing, Hu Minteng, and Chen Yutian. At that time, the lineup was Jiang Shanjing and Li Huitang as inner guards, Sun Sijing as the central defender, Chen Pu and Hu Minteng as forwards, and the forwards from right to left were Chen Yutian, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Zhenhe, Xi Qiaosheng, and Wang Yongjie. Lehua's strength was insufficient, and they were under pressure from the start. After repeatedly defending, they were finally scored against by Xiao Shi after six minutes. The ball was not fast, but Zhou's skills were more than enough to handle it. Unexpectedly, the ball was touched in the middle, changing its direction, resulting in a loss. Lehua's Wang Yongjie worked hard to advance and successfully sent the ball to the center. Xi Qiaosheng received it and attacked, shooting the ball out of bounds. Following that, Chen Yutian made three excellent crosses, but unfortunately, there was no one to receive them. As a result, it only caused some alarm among the opposing team, and the audience was temporarily excited. However, Huosaisi's momentum became even more rampant, and Lehua's area almost became a battleground. Zhou Xianyan was the target of everyone's attacks, often risking his life to defuse the situation. Later, because the inner guard went out to assist, Huosaisi's center forward, Lang Shi, took advantage of the gap and entered directly, scoring another goal. In the first half, Huosaisi took a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>▲ Lehua Team's Spirit Greatly Boosted</p>
<p>In the second half, Lehua changed its lineup. The inner guards were Jiang Shanjing and Hu Minteng, the defensive line was Pu, Li Huitang, and Sun Sijing, and the forwards were Xi Qiaosheng, Chen Yutian, Chen Jiaqiu, Chen Zhenhe, and Wang Yongjie. At this time, the situation improved for Lehua compared to before, but it still did not make up for the fact that the opening was swift and the cooperative forwards of Huosaisi were still very active. Zhou Xianyan made two saves before announcing a temporary truce. Not long after, Huosaisi invaded again, and the right-winger Tang En crossed the ball. The right inside, Pan Te, added a kick, and the ball went into the net. After losing three goals, Lehua seemed to be in a desperate situation. Captain Li immediately changed his plan and changed the lineup for the third time, returning to his original position on the left inside to strengthen the forward line. Sun Sijing and Chen Zhenhe also remained in their old positions as central defender and left forward. From then on, Lehua worked hard to advance, rescuing life from death. Unexpectedly, Huosaisi's center forward, Lang Shi, broke into the hinterland again. There was no one in sight in front, behind, to the left, or to the right. Lang Shi calmly aimed at the goal and attacked directly. Zhou Xianyan took advantage of his hesitation and, with lightning speed, lunged forward and caught the ball from under his iron hooves, saving the situation. The Chinese and foreign spectators in the entire stadium cheered endlessly. The spirit of Lehua's offensive was also revived again. Li Huitang sent a ball from the crowd, giving Wang Yongjie a chance to attack. Wang handled it properly and lived up to expectations, scoring a goal. Within three minutes, Chen Jiaqiu also showed his skills, hitting the left post of the goal and bouncing the ball into the net. Lehua scored two goals in a row, and their spirit was soaring. Before long, Chen Yutian dribbled the ball forward, and Wang Yongjie was seen kicking it again, each scoring three goals. The score was tied, the atmosphere in the entire stadium was tense, and the situation became serious. Huosaisi's Xiao Shi and Lang Shi shot at each other, but were all saved by Zhou. Li Huitang went deep into the enemy's territory alone, skillfully avoiding the obstacles of the inner guard and the two goalkeepers, and was about to break through, but the inner guard caught up first and forced him into a corner. Wang kicked the ball, the landing point was appropriate, and they tackled each other. Chen Yutian kicked quickly, and with a loud bang, the ball went into the goal. Lehua then took a 4-3 lead. Li Huitang was unfortunately injured and left the field for treatment, but he soon returned to the field with his injury, fearing that all his efforts would be in vain. As a result, Lehua came from behind to win 4-3.</p>
<p>▲ Huosaisi Defeated Due to Underestimation</p>
<p>Yesterday, Huosaisi's players were well-rounded and their strength was strong. At the beginning of the game, their chances of winning were already certain. Seeing them score repeatedly and being invincible, it was feared that Lehua would be completely defeated in this match. However, after scoring three goals, they suddenly became complacent, which led to Lehua's comeback and their own defeat. The mistake was a single thought. Alas, it can be taken as a lesson.</p>

<h3>Financial Daily Interest Rate Flat, Subsidiary Coinage Changes Suddenly</h3>
<p>The market was quiet yesterday. The daily interest rate was quoted at 7 yuan 2 fen 0 hao 1 li 2 hu 5 si in the morning and 7 yuan 2 fen 0 hao 3 li 7 hu 5 si in the afternoon. The result was 1 hao 2 hu 5 si lower than the previous day, and the market seemed to fluctuate by 2 hao 5 si that day. The silver exchange rate was still loose, and the price was still white borrowing. The exchange of bills was still normal. The trading volume of foreign exchange drafts was only 200,000 in the morning and no more than 450,000 in the afternoon. As for banknote trading, there was no news inside or outside the market. This day was a Sunday, and the banks were closed, so there was not much trading. According to news from money shops, more than 17 million silver public bills and 2 million foreign public bills were received. Remittances from various sources amounted to 300,000 to 400,000. The banknote exchange transactions of small peers were estimated to be about 300,000. However, Guangjiao coins in the subsidiary coinage market showed special changes in the morning market due to some competition among small peers. The morning closing price rose to 6 yuan 1 fen, 1 fen 5 li 5 hao higher than the morning price of the previous day. By the afternoon, the market was calmed down by market participants, but the closing price was still only 5 yuan 9 fen 6 li 7 hao 5 si, only 1 li 2 hao 5 si better than the afternoon price of the previous day. The trading volume was 85,000 jiao in the morning and 30,000 jiao in the afternoon. The price of Jiangnan Xiaoyang coins was stable at 6 yuan 1 fen 1 li in the morning, with a trading volume of 5,000 jiao. There was no change in the afternoon. Copper coins also remained unchanged at 401 wu, with a trading volume of more than 33,000 strings.</p>
<h3>Securities Last Week's Government Bond Trend Remained Stagnant</h3>
<p>▲Minimal fluctuations in index... Trading volume only slightly over 1.5 million On the local securities and bond market situation last week, the spot market remained extremely quiet, with a trading volume of only 47,000 yuan, including 13,000 yuan of the 6% Consolidation Bonds, 11,000 yuan of Series Two-Five Bonds, 10,000 yuan of Rehabilitation Bonds, 8,000 yuan of Customs Bonds, and only a few thousand yuan of other bonds. As for the futures market, the bond market atmosphere was dull, and it was around the end of the month settlement period, so the trading volume was far less than before. The market sentiment was very quiet. Excluding Thursday's market closure for settlement, Monday's trading volume was 4 million yuan. On Tuesday, as the February contract had expired, only the March contract was traded, with a trading volume of just over 1.1 million yuan. On Wednesday, due to the opening of the April contract, it increased to over 4.4 million yuan, but the market became quiet again after settlement. On Friday, it was about 3.8 million yuan, and on the weekend, only 2.1 million yuan. The total trading volume for the entire week was 15,585,000 yuan, a decrease of more than 15 million yuan compared to the previous week, including 195,000 yuan of Customs Bonds for February, 2.78 million yuan for March, 1.46 million yuan for April, 235,000 yuan of Rehabilitation Bonds for February, 2.06 million yuan for March, 1.94 million yuan for April, 355,000 yuan of Series Two Bonds for February, 2.18 million yuan for March, 760,000 yuan for April, 395,000 yuan of Series Two-Five Bonds for February, 1.155 million yuan for March, and 385,000 yuan for April. Other trading was quite scarce, such as only 1.42 million yuan for the 6% Consolidation Bonds, 715,000 yuan for the 96 Government Bonds, 195,000 yuan for the 7-Year Bonds, and 55,000 yuan for the Financial Bonds. Examining the price fluctuations of various bonds, from the beginning to the end of the week, the market fluctuated only slightly each day, with hardly any significant gains or losses to report. The fluctuation for the entire week was only about one yuan, and even compared to the previous week, the change was only a few jiao. Such a stagnant situation was truly rare. The overall situation last week was that the situation was brewing but without obvious changes, and the bond market atmosphere was even more dull. Major traders were hesitant to act, and there were very few entries and exits. Even small traders were unwilling to do much, as it was the settlement period and the market was uncertain. Therefore, the market situation was very stable, and the trend was very stagnant. Judging from the current situation, it seems that changes in bond prices are not far off, but without significant developments in the overall situation, bond prices are unlikely to fluctuate greatly. The following is a statistical table of the highest and lowest prices and fluctuations of various bonds during the past week (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Last Week, Yarn Sales in Yunnan and Guangdong Were Particularly Strong</h3>
<p>The yarn market was quite weak at the beginning of the week, mainly because of numerous rumors about the current situation, which led to stagnation in actual sales. Factories had a large amount of unsold inventory, and sellers took the opportunity to exert pressure, causing a lack of confidence in the market. At the same time, there was also unfavorable news about American cotton. Given the increasing accumulation of spot goods and the obstruction of transportation routes, buyers generally adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, there was no significant development in business throughout the week. However, buyers from Yunnan and Zhenjiang purchased a considerable amount, and the futures trading of Japanese yarn was relatively active. In reality, the yarn market has too much inventory, making it difficult to increase prices. However, if sales can improve, there is room for optimism. The total amount of yarn purchased by various buyers throughout the week was 8,315 bales, with 5,200 bales purchased by domestic traders. In terms of price trends, the price of native yarn was relatively weak. The price of standard yarn initially experienced panic due to the poor atmosphere of the current situation and the decline in foreign cotton prices, with the lowest price for distant months reaching 150 taels and 3 qian. Later, due to the demand for spot yarn in Yunnan and Guangdong, the rebound in American cotton prices, and the rise in raw cotton prices, major traders made profits and closed out their positions. As a result, the distant month prices rose by 7 to 8 qian compared to the previous week. The total trading volume for the entire week was 106,850 bales, with 3,000 bales opened by factories. The amount of yarn purchased by each buyer and the buyer groups are listed below:</p>
<p>| Buyer Group | Bales | Buyer Group | Bales | Buyer Group | Bales |</p>
<p>| -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | -------- | ----- |</p>
<p>| Inland   | 900  | Shantou | 450  | Xuzhou  | 100  |</p>
<p>| Guangdong | 900  | Sichuan | 100  | Qinhuangdao | 80   |</p>
<p>| Hankou  | 250  | Qingdao | 800  | Jiangxi  | 150  |</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Weak at First, Then Strong Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market was weak at the beginning of the week due to the weakness of American cotton. At the same time, the price of Indian cotton was low, and foreign firms were manipulating prices in the market, selling cotton similar to the standard grade for only 32.5 taels, and even delivering it to the factories. As a result, the market consensus was to expect lower prices, and everyone sold short aggressively. Therefore, the futures price fell from 4 liang and 3 qian to 3 liang and 5.5 qian. However, due to the high land prices and obstructed supply routes, buyers from Hankou held onto their spot goods and refused to sell them, and instead aggressively absorbed cotton in the futures market. Before long, the situation of American cotton improved, and although Indian cotton was cheap, it ultimately could not offset the standard grade. Small traders saw that the Hankou buyers were manipulating the market significantly and were afraid of being squeezed, so buying interest suddenly tightened and the upward trend suddenly intensified. The price rose by more than 1 liang in two days. Currently, the cotton market is characterized by strong competition between bulls and bears, and the future is difficult to predict. The distant month price of the standard grade was 4 to 5 qian higher than the previous week, and the March contract was 1 liang higher. The total volume for the entire week was 221,800 dan. The supply at the docks was 500 dan of Yao cotton. Manufacturers purchased a large amount of Indian cotton, with factories purchasing 93,790 dan of spot and futures goods, and trading firms purchasing 2,900 dan. There was no significant increase or decrease in American cotton compared to the previous week. The following is a breakdown of the amount purchased by manufacturers and trading firms:</p>
<p>| Manufacturer | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Quantity | Delivery Time |</p>
<p>| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |</p>
<p>| Pingqieer | 33.00 | 30.50 | 2,000 pieces | Spot delivery to factory |</p>
<p>| Yao Cotton | 32.80 | 32.50 | 2,200 bales | Spot delivery to factory |</p>
<p>| Shaanxi Cotton | 37.00 | 34.75 | 7,250 pieces | Spot delivery to factory |</p>
<p>| Xingheng Cotton | 32.50 | 31.25 | 8,000 pieces | May-June delivery to factory |</p>
<p>| Xingheng Cotton (Japanese Yuan 30.50) | 30.50 | 30.00 | 7,000 pieces | May-June |</p>
<p>| Trading Firm | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Quantity | Delivery Time |</p>
<p>| Shaanxi Cotton | 36.60 | 34.50 | 70 pieces | Spot delivery to warehouse |</p>
<p>| Yao Cotton | 32.80 | ...... | 200 bales | Spot delivery to warehouse |</p>
<h3>American Cotton Bulls Close Positions, Prices Fall</h3>
<p>▲English and Indian Cotton Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was calm and uneventful, falling due to flat spot prices and bull closing positions. Futures fell 20 to 28 points, and spot prices fell 20 points. English cotton futures rose 3 points, and spot prices rose 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 10 points. Indian cotton was firm due to purchases by exporters and speculators, with Pingguoer rising 5 rupees, forward contracts rising 5 to 6 rupees, Aomula rising 6 rupees, forward contracts rising 6 to 7 rupees, and Bairoxi rising 6 rupees, forward contracts rising 7 rupees.

<h3>Supply and Demand of American Cotton in the Last Ten Years</h3>
<p>Recently, American cotton has repeatedly hit new lows for the season. According to reports from New York, the reasons for this include external pressure, the lack of active measures by the Agricultural Bureau, and the decline in consumption. However, the active improvement and promotion of cotton production in various countries also has a considerable driving force. As for the world's cotton production situation, it was previously reported that a statistician in Lancashire estimated that the consumption of American cotton in 1929-30 would decrease compared to the previous season. Whether this is true or not will be verified in the future. The following is a table comparing the figures for the supply and demand of American cotton and the changes in market prices over the past ten years with the pre-war period (the unit for supply and demand is bales, and the unit for price is pence):</p>
<p>| Year       | Stock Overhang | New Cotton | Total Supply | Consumption | Price   |</p>

<h3>Observations on Cotton Trade in the Sino-Japanese Reciprocal Agreement</h3>
<p>According to recent reports, the Sino-Japanese tariff treaty has been repeatedly discussed and is approaching completion, with the formal signing imminent. However, the Japanese side has proposed a reciprocal agreement, with dozens of items proposed for reciprocity. It is reported that the first item is cotton yarn and cloth, including all raw materials and products of cotton yarn and cloth. This is still the old case from several years ago, which shows that the Japanese have never forgotten this matter. The Japanese cotton textile industry has been developing rapidly after the Sino-Japanese, Russo-Japanese, and European wars, and its foreign trade is mainly targeted at our country. This is because our country has a large population, and although the domestic cotton textile industry has made progress compared to the past, cotton products are still not enough to meet domestic demand. The clothing and bedding needed still have to rely on imports. However, European and American goods have been squeezed out by Japanese goods due to human relations and geographical factors. According to customs reports, cotton imports in our country account for the first place in the total import value annually, with Japanese goods accounting for more than 50% of cotton imports. However, the export value is only a fraction of the import value, except for cotton. Given that reciprocal trade involves mutual exchange, it is strange to talk about reciprocity when trade is still only a fraction in ratio. The following is a table of figures from recent customs reports on the relationship between cotton trade in our country and Japan over the past five years, to avoid unnecessary worries.

<h3>Grains, Rice Market Downstream Turns Soft</h3>
<p>▲More than 40 boats arrived in Zhabei yesterday. Sales were stagnant. High-quality Northern Japonica rice was scarce but prices remained flat. Medium-grade and lower-quality rice was overstocked and sales were slow, with a small decrease of one or two jiao per liang. The market shifted from flat to soft. Although the price in the original source was firm, the Shanghai market did not improve. There were fewer arrivals of early thin-skinned rice. Sales to restaurants and rural areas were not active, and prices were weak. Early Indica rice and Duzi Indica rice were initially very firm, but then became flat due to sluggish buying interest. Sales of Indica rice from other ports were also normal. Arrivals and sales of white yuan rice were balanced, and prices were neither good nor bad.</p>
<p>▲More than 20 boats arrived downstream in Shanghai South. High-quality rice sold well in this area, while lower-quality rice was slow to move. Common Xixi Northern Japonica rice and Su-style white Japonica rice prices were flat and stable. High-quality rice was still actively traded, while lower-quality rice was stagnant and had few transactions. Recently, sales in rural areas have been slow, and the overall market has been sluggish. Local demand for thin-skinned early rice was also stagnant, and the supply was readily available, so inventory was high. Sales have been frequently quiet recently, and prices have been difficult to maintain, falling by a small jiao. Due to the impact of foreign rice prices on the gold market, the prices of lamb and Duzi Indica rice have risen, so a few buyers have become more active, and the market has been firm. Sales of common goods have slowed down, and only high-quality rice is still in demand. Top-quality yuan rice is still selling well, while medium-quality rice is not good.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods, Orchid Seeds Market Turns Loose</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a batch of orchid seeds arrived via the Niuzhuang wheel from Xiamen, totaling 3,010 pieces. According to letters, prices at the place of origin have not fluctuated much. However, as more and more goods have arrived here recently, inventory has gradually accumulated, and buyers have become less active, so the market trend has become flat. The goods were released in full yesterday. The quality and fragrance are still good, but the quality is relatively low, and the price has decreased by five or six qian compared to the previous market. The goods are being distributed by various firms.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Coarse and Fine Granulated Sugar Continue to Rise by More Than 1 Qian</h3>
<p>▲Trading is Still Active... The Market Outlook is Slightly Flat</p>
<p>Yesterday's telegrams from the sugar-producing areas were not available due to it being Sunday. The market atmosphere for coarse granulated sugar from the Dutch sugar market, which was determined by the association, was quite strong. The initial transaction price was 7 liang and 2.5 qian, but the supply was very short. Buyers were very interested in buying, and the price rose to 7 liang and 3 qian. High-quality sugar was priced at 7 liang, 3 qian, and 2.5 fen. At this time, demand was still strong, and the price of ordinary sugar also rose to 7 liang, 3 qian, and 2.5 fen. The market shape still felt very firm. Sellers asked for 7 liang and 3.5 qian, but buyers hesitated slightly. Then, a major trader released a large quantity at a high price, and the transaction price was 7 liang, 3 qian, and 2.5 fen, and the market became gradually flat. The total transaction volume for the entire market was 6,000 to 7,000 bags. The price increased by 1 qian and 2.5 fen compared to the previous day. The market for fine granulated sugar also rose, with prices ranging from 7 liang, 3 qian, and 5 fen to 4 qian. The price of 20-grade medium-grade granulated white sugar was 7 liang and 5 fen. There were fewer transactions, but the market was still not weak. The Japanese sugar market was chaotic. (M) brand was priced at 8 liang, and (SH) brand was priced at 7 liang and 9 qian, but no transactions were made due to a lack of buyers. The market outlook for (N) brand was 7 liang and 9 qian, and TX brand was 7 liang and 7.5 qian, with few transactions. The market shape still felt firm. Overall, domestic sales of sugar have not been active recently, but the market has been dominated by the high exchange rate. Traders who had made prior commitments were not able to profit and even suffered losses. For the sake of this industry, it is recommended that all sugar purchased on a term basis in the future be converted to silver-based transactions in order to avoid unexpected losses due to exchange rates. This may improve the prospects of the industry. It is hoped that the industry will take action quickly.</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Future of Silk and Tea, Green Tea</h3>
<p>▲This Year's Products Are Expected to Be Tender and Delicate</p>
<p>▲The Decline of Tunxi Agriculture and Commerce Can Be Reversed</p>
<p>Green tea is the only export product of Tunxi. In recent years, sales in the UK and Russia have developed greatly, and the value has also been increasing steadily. However, last year, just as tea prices were at their peak, they were suddenly hit by the Sino-Russian war, and the Russian route was abruptly cut off. Market prices plummeted, and at the same time, inventory accumulated. Tunxi also had 3,000 cases of tribute tea stored, which could not be transported to Shanghai. The tragic situation was unprecedented. The Spring Festival has already passed, and less than half of the tea firms are preparing to proceed with business. Fortunately, there was heavy snow last winter, which benefited the tea bushes greatly. It is predicted that the quality of this year's products will be particularly tender and delicate, which may slightly reverse the decline of farmers and merchants here.</p>
<h3>Hardware Prices Rise Again by 1 Fen of Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Recently, the foreign exchange rate has been falling frequently, and the decline was even more severe the day before yesterday (Saturday). For example, the British pound fell to 1 shilling and 10 pence and 25, and the US dollar was 45 yuan, which was an unprecedented low. The cost of hardware and various goods has increased by more than 1 fen of copper coins invisibly, but the prices quoted in the market have mostly only increased by two or three qian. However, buyers are concerned about the high prices and are unable to take action, so transactions have become more sluggish. However, considering the rising prices overseas and the declining value of the local pound, it is feared that the market standard will be difficult to improve. The current price of French nails has risen to 7 liang, 18-sheet black leather is 9 liang, tinplate is 19 liang and 5 qian, and 16- to 20-gauge new lead wire is 10 liang and 7.5 qian. The prices of other goods are also gradually increasing.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Dai Jitao and Zhu Jiahua Arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong Yesterday</h3>
<p>▲Wang Boling Also Came and Immediately Went to Beijing in the Evening</p>
<p>▲Dai Said Yan Lacks the Courage to Form Another Government</p>
<p>▲A New Peak Discovered Near Dajianlu</p>
<p>Dai Jitao, President of the Examination Yuan, Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province, and Wang Boling, a member of the Central Executive Committee and Director of the Jiangxi Construction Department, who was previously sent to Yunnan by order of the Central Government, all arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5:30 pm on the Japanese ship Asama Maru from Hong Kong. The Asama Maru's voyage was originally scheduled to arrive at 1:00 pm the day before yesterday, but it encountered heavy fog along the way, which stopped the ship for one day. It was expected to arrive at the port at 1:00 pm yesterday, but it was delayed until 5:30 pm due to heavy fog before docking at the Huishan Wharf. Those who welcomed them at the wharf included Zhou Xiangxian, the Mayor of Hangzhou, the adjutant of the Garrison Headquarters, and Zhu Jiahua's wife. After disembarking, Dai, Zhu, Wang, and others took cars to their respective residences to rest. At 11:00 pm last night, they took the night train to Beijing to attend today's Third Plenary Session. At 7:00 pm last night, our reporter interviewed Dai Jitao at his residence. The following is a brief account of his remarks:</p>
<p>▲Progress in Guangdong Affairs, Dai said, "I have been away from Guangdong for more than a year. This time, when I went back, I saw that there had been very great progress in various matters in Guangdong, and the municipal administration achievements were particularly remarkable. In the military campaign against Gui, the Guangdong army won a major victory before I left. I think the solution will not be far off."</p>
<p>▲Staying in Hong Kong for One Day "I stayed in Hong Kong for one night while waiting for the ship. I enjoyed the scenery very much. As for the activities of the reactionary faction in Hong Kong and Wang Jingwei's actions, I did not have time to know them deeply because I passed through Hong Kong in a hurry. After the ship left Hong Kong, it encountered heavy fog and stopped for a whole day."</p>
<p>▲No Proposals Dai also said, "The main task of the Third Plenary Session, in addition to the special situation issues, is to sort out the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session and the first and second sessions of the National Congress, and discuss the direction of their implementation. I do not have any new proposals. Director Zhu Jiahua also did not prepare any proposals on educational issues due to the urgency of time. Chairman Chen Mingshu was unable to come due to the complexity of political affairs, and I have not heard that he will submit any proposals to the conference."</p>

<h3>City Representative Assembly Representatives Inspect Various Agencies Today</h3>
<p>▲Attended the expanded weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen held by the Municipal Government this morning</p>
<p>The Sixth Shanghai Special Municipality City Representative Assembly commenced on the morning of March 1st. In the afternoon, members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees were elected, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Sunday, the assembly recessed according to the agenda. Today, all representatives gathered at 9:00 AM in the auditorium of the Municipal Party Headquarters to hold an expanded weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen, inviting representatives from various agencies to participate. After the memorial service, they divided into four groups to inspect the actual implementation of policies at various agencies. Furthermore, the various party and government reports from the first day of the assembly are of significant importance. In addition to the Party Affairs Report from the Municipal Executive Committee and the Municipal Administration Report from the Municipal Government already published in this newspaper, the Work Report from the Municipal Supervisory Committee and the Security Report from the Garrison Headquarters are printed below:</p>
<p>▲Supervisory Committee Report</p>
<p>This committee was established in March of the 18th year [of the Republic] and has now reached its first anniversary. Regarding internal organization, in accordance with the organizational regulations issued by the Central Government, there is one Standing Committee member, one secretary, and one each of document staff, auditor, and review staff. Daily routine tasks concerning documentation, such as receiving and dispatching documents, safekeeping files, drafting and issuing meeting minutes, etc., will not be elaborated upon. As for the auditing and reviewing work, please allow us to briefly describe them as follows: (1) Disciplining subordinate party branches or party members: Most comrades in this city have long held steadfast beliefs in the party's principles, demonstrated loyal behavior, and worked diligently. However, there are occasional instances of a small number of comrades with weak wills who have gone astray, requiring the imposition of party discipline. Nevertheless, this committee invariably conducts a thorough review of their words and actions, considering the severity of the facts to impose appropriate disciplinary measures. In total, there were 14 warnings, 20 suspensions of party membership rights, and 33 expulsions from the party. Although the numbers are not particularly high, this committee finds them regrettable. We hope that comrades in this city will encourage each other to abide by discipline and strive for the party. (2) Auditing the financial revenues and expenditures of the Municipal Executive Committee: The Municipal Executive Committee prepares a monthly statement of revenues and expenditures, along with supporting receipts, and submits them to the committee for auditing. This committee meticulously reviews them in accordance with the auditing regulations issued by the Central Government. The results generally show no discrepancies. The details of the process are recorded in the audit records and will not be detailed here. (3) Reviewing the party affairs situation in this city: The work of various departments and sections of the Municipal Executive Committee: 1. The Organization Department's plans for dispatching personnel to guide party member congresses in various district branches, recruit probationary party members, punish reactionaries, and convene city-wide organizational meetings are well-planned and executed with diligence. 2. The Publicity Department is largely able to follow the publicity plans prescribed by the Central Government, serving as a precursor for political initiatives, such as campaigns to denounce Tang [Shengzhi] and Feng [Yuxiang], and to promote domestic goods, which have largely enabled the public to recognize the party's principles and policies. 3. The Training Department's efforts to assess the level of party ideology among service personnel in various agencies in this city, and to certify party ideology instructors and training directors in this city, are also quite diligent. 4. The work of the Mass Training Committee, such as guiding mass movements, organizing mass organizations, handling labor disputes, and promoting cooperation between labor and capital, has demonstrable achievements. Furthermore, the district party branches have also been able to work diligently, which is gratifying. Overall, while there are many advantages in the state of party affairs in the city, shortcomings are inevitable. For example, in terms of organization, many district branches still fail to convene meetings on time, and some have even failed to reach quorum multiple times. In terms of publicity, there is only passive work to cope with the environment, lacking proactive work in construction. In terms of training, efforts should be devoted to the ideological training of party members, the training of organizational abilities, the training of publicity abilities, and the training of actions in training the people in governance. Only then will training be practical and realistic. However, the past work of the Municipal and District Training Department seems unable to take all this into account. As for the mission borne by mass training, it is particularly important and should also pay attention to the ideological, behavioral, and organizational training of the masses. However, the Municipal and District Mass Training Committees seem to have no time for this. These are all imperfections in the party affairs of this city, and we hope that those who come after us will know where to focus their efforts. (4) Regarding the administrative aspects of this city: The Municipal Government of this city has been quite diligent in its work over the past year, such as establishing a municipal bank to regulate finance, urging various bureaus to work hard on initiatives, and the various bureaus have also made considerable achievements. For example, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works' widening of existing roads to facilitate transportation seems to have had considerable success. However, the dilapidated houses in this city that should be demolished and the newly emerging buildings that should be carefully inspected should be dealt with in a timely manner to seek the welfare of the citizens. The achievements of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities are still good. The Municipal Bureau of Health has been paying attention to the issue of epidemic prevention. The Municipal Bureau of Education has seen considerable achievements in school education. However, it seems that efforts should be increased in mass education, and it is hoped that the amount of educational funding will also be increased to facilitate progress. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs has been able to strictly supervise charitable organizations in this city and handle labor disputes fairly. The Municipal Port Authority has not yet planned for the dredging of the New Huangpu River to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan for a major oriental port and should make plans as soon as possible. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's efforts to maintain public order are limited by financial resources, with insufficient police numbers and a failure to improve equipment, making its strength seem weak. Furthermore, prostitutes, gamblers, local bullies, and thugs have not been completely eradicated, and daylight robberies are still heard of from time to time. We hope that the Municipal Government will supervise and urge the bureau to work hard to eliminate reactionary forces and corrupt behavior so that the public security of the citizens can be fully maintained.</p>
<p>▲Garrison Headquarters Report</p>
<p>The work of the Songhu Garrison in the 18th year [of the Republic] is hereby reported as follows: 1. Matters relating to pacification: (1) Deployment of defense: The defense zone of this headquarters is the former Ninth Pacification Zone. In addition to the Shanghai Special Municipality, there are also the Fifth Division with three infantry regiments and one battalion each of artillery, engineers, and sappers in the thirteen counties including Shanghai and Baoshan. The troop deployment is as reported in the 17th year. After March of the 18th year, this headquarters also took charge of security matters for the Jinghu [Nanjing-Shanghai] and Huhang [Shanghai-Hangzhou] Railways. The counties along the railways were incorporated into the defense zone, and troop deployments have changed several times. However, the Fifth Division remains responsible for security near Songhu, and the deployment is largely the same. Looking back over the past year, although the overall situation has repeatedly changed and dangerous situations have arisen, and reactionaries have wantonly created disturbances in the Jinghu area, attempting to sabotage, the area within the defense zone of this headquarters has been able to maintain peace and avoid negligence. (2) Martial law incidents: The Shanghai concession area has long been the headquarters of reactionary factions, as mentioned above. Amidst the country's many troubles, their activities have been particularly vigorous. For example, during the various revolutionary memorial days in May and the International Red Day on August 1st, the Communist Party had plans for major riots. When the Northwest Army and the troops of Tang Shengzhi mutinied, reactionaries also concocted countless schemes in the Shanghai and Jinghu area, wantonly creating disturbances and attempting to subvert the party and the nation. This headquarters, on the one hand, sought to eradicate their organizations and arrest their key figures, and on the other hand, temporarily declared martial law, supervised the military and police to strictly prevent incidents from occurring. In the end, no accidents occurred. As of today, except for the fact that the Communist Party has not been completely eliminated, most of the other reactionary factions have disappeared, and public order can gradually become consolidated. (3) Collection of information: Shanghai is the headquarters of reactionary factions, as mentioned above. Therefore, the collection of information is the most important part of the pacification work. This headquarters attaches great importance to information work, striving to ensure that every move of the reactionary factions can be detected and prevented at any time. Although intelligence personnel have been repeatedly attacked by the reactionary factions and have suffered many sacrifices, they have been able to persevere in the face of hardship. Over the past year, the military and police have been supervised to dismantle reactionary organizations, such as the various levels of party branches of the Communist Party, the Red Trade Unions, the radio stations of the rebellious armies, the organs of the reactionary factions, and the small-press organs of the various reactionary factions, no fewer than dozens of locations. Many important reactionary figures have been arrested, which has a significant impact on public order. In order to effectively connect with party and government agencies, this headquarters has also jointly held daily intelligence meetings with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government to exchange information, discuss disposal methods, and cooperate in the process. This has continued to this day. Regarding the construction of military works, this headquarters, in order to provide military security for various counties and facilitate transportation, proposed a plan for building military works, constructing roads, and setting up long-distance telephone networks at the security conference convened in February of the 18th year, and detailed implementation measures were determined. However, over the past year, it has been affected by military affairs, and being preoccupied with defense, there has been no time to proceed. In addition, due to a lack of funding, only the long-distance telephone networks along the Jinghu and Huhang Railways have been completed, and the rest are still under construction. It is hoped that the comrades will provide guidance from time to time to correct any shortcomings. (End)</p>

<h3>Postal Workers Union's Doubts about Savings and Remittance Bureau</h3>
<p>▲Has Received Replies from the Ministry and the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications will establish the Postal Savings and Remittance General Bureau, which is scheduled to open in Shanghai on March 15th. The Shanghai Postal Workers Union believes that the establishment of the bureau has been rushed, and the members have researched the matter and found many doubts. In order to solemnly respect the wishes of the national government, they have successively submitted requests to the Ministry of Communications and the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters for detailed explanations, so that they can relay them to the members and dispel doubts.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Begins Elections for Directors Today</h3>
<p>▲Ballot Box Located at 23 Jiangxi Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the elections for the directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement will be held for two days starting tomorrow (the 3rd). The voting time is from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, and voting is allowed during lunch break to facilitate voters. Ballots will not be issued in advance and must be collected in person by voters from the General Office at 23 Jiangxi Road. The ballot box is also located there. There are nine foreign directors to be elected, with a total of thirteen candidates. There are eight British candidates competing for five seats traditionally held by the British, three American candidates competing for two seats traditionally held by the Americans, and only two Japanese candidates competing for two seats traditionally held by the Japanese. Therefore, there is still some competition among the British and American candidates, and it is unknown who will win.</p>
<h3>Foreign Newspapers Continue to Report on the Political Views of Candidates for the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>▲Carey, Peill, Macnaghten, Burden, Hughes, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times continues to publish the political views of the candidates for the Municipal Council, stating that American Carey stated that if elected, he would do his best to assist the directors in handling municipal affairs using commercial methods, and to seek an early resolution of the telephone problem. Improving sanitation and transportation should be given careful consideration as a priority. British Peill stated that his consistent aim is to use a unified method to retain the rights and freedoms of the concession in order to seek the interests of all residents, and to faithfully accept the resolutions of the authorities of various countries. He will pay special attention to the progress of public works and advocate an progressive approach. Improving the docks to facilitate the loading and unloading of passengers and goods is also seen as an urgent task. Major General Macnaghten of England stated that since the directors are elected by the taxpayers, anything related to the rights of the taxpayers should be based on the interests of the taxpayers, which is the principle he has always followed. In addition, he advocates that news reporters should be allowed to observe the board meetings, that the number of Chinese directors should be increased to five, that financial austerity should continue, that police and sanitation should cooperate with the Chinese authorities, that the safeguards stipulated in Article 11 should be fully exercised regarding the Provisional Court, and that the status quo should be maintained regarding the concession issue before the Feetham Report. Reverend Burden of the United States stated that he will do his best to seek happiness for the entire public and that everyone should have equal and appropriate opportunities for education, regardless of nationality or race. Regarding the issue of the recovery of the concession, he will seek to safeguard what was created with difficulty by the Chinese and foreign people. The status quo should be maintained before the Feetham investigation. Regarding treaty issues, he deeply believes in the sanctity of public and private contractual obligations, and that changes are inevitable now that the situation has changed, but they should be based on mutual consideration and compliance with the provisions. In addition, he advocates openness in municipal administration, satisfaction with telephone service, and that the Provisional Court should not be influenced by political forces. Hughes of England stated that serving the public must have a loyal will, good education, excellent judgment, a fair heart, and rich experience, and that assessing whether the candidate has the aforementioned qualifications is the basis of the election. Unfortunately, there have been few candidates in previous elections, leaving the voters unable to exercise their support. This is because independent candidates are not easily elected, and the lack of transparency in municipal administration is why taxpayers do not pay attention to municipal affairs, which is the root cause.</p>
<h3>Wusong Garrison Troops Transferred</h3>
<p>Xiao Zhiping's regiment, the 29th regiment of the Fifth Division stationed in Paotaiwan, Wusong, ordered its first battalion yesterday to be transferred from Yujiamiao, Pudong, to Jiangwan, the second battalion to be transferred from Jiangwan to Wusong, and the third battalion originally stationed in Wusong to be transferred to Pudong.

<h3>Administrative Lawsuits May Invoke Existing Petition Law</h3>
<p>A document from the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department instructs the county government, stating, "A document from the Jiangsu Provincial Government instructed, which stated, 'A document from the Executive Yuan instructed, which stated, 'A document from the National Government instructed, which stated, 'A letter from the Central Political Conference stated, which stated, 'A letter from the Government Civil Service Department stated, which stated, 'We received a telegram from lawyer Ma Da, requesting instructions on which agency to file administrative lawsuits in the event of illegal punishment by government agencies. The reply was, 'The 53rd State Council meeting had already ordered the Judicial Yuan to establish an administrative court as soon as possible. However, before the court is established, how should it be handled? Please ask the Political Conference for an explanation and a reply, etc. The 211th meeting of this conference discussed and decided to hand it over to Committee Member Wang Chonghui for research. Now, the reply states, 'After reviewing the relevant laws and regulations regarding administrative lawsuits, it is found that they have not yet been promulgated, and the old clauses are inconsistent with the current situation. Even if instructions are given to agencies at this time, it will not only cause difficulties in handling affairs but also be of no practical benefit to the people. The Judicial Yuan is re-researching the previous draft of the Administrative Litigation Law and the Administrative Court Organization Law and will submit it soon. Before the administrative court is established, for illegal punishments by administrative agencies, the old petition law may be temporarily invoked to file petitions. The Executive Yuan consulted the Judicial Yuan about this matter, and the Yuan replied to the Executive Yuan on December 13 of the 18th year according to this intention, stating that it can be handled accordingly, etc. Therefore, we should act accordingly and reply to the province and separately order our subordinates to comply with this order, etc. "Therefore, we should act accordingly, and in addition to replying to the province and separately ordering our subordinates, we shall order the provincial government to comply and order our subordinates to comply, etc.' (abridged)</p>
<h3>Civil Affairs Department Reaffirms Procedures for Purchasing Firearms</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received an instruction from the Civil Affairs Department yesterday, stating, "In order to comply, tracing back over the past few years, banditry in various parts of Jiangsu Province has been rampant, repeatedly suppressed but repeatedly arising, without a peaceful year. For the sake of prevention, the counties have mostly purchased and prepared firearms to defend themselves. This department believes that firearms are of great importance and is deeply concerned that carelessness in handling them may lead to abuses. Therefore, a general order No. 2693 was issued in May of the 17th year, stipulating the procedures for purchasing firearms, which was to be complied with. However, recently, counties have still purchased firearms without prior approval, which is contrary to this department's original intention. Therefore, the previous order is hereby reaffirmed. In the future, any purchase of firearms should be based on the local situation in the county, with a clear list of the types and quantities of firearms to be purchased. A report should be submitted to the department for approval in advance, and then funds should be prepared and reported to this department for handling on its behalf in order to show seriousness. In addition to distributing the order, the County Magistrate is hereby ordered to comply, without fail. This order is of utmost importance. " (Daily News)</p>
<h3>Shen Jinghua Dispatches Personnel to Inspect Police Affairs in Various Townships</h3>
<p>Shen Jinghua, Director of the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau, has dispatched the Chief Inspector, Zhao Lian, with a prescribed form, to various branch bureaus and offices under his jurisdiction to inspect the state of police affairs, as he is not yet fully aware of the situation in the various branch bureaus and offices under his jurisdiction and the state of police affairs. After the officer reports back, there will be a reorganization. Zhao Lian departed on March 1 to work in various townships.</p>
<h3>Silk Merchants Request Extension of Inspection Period</h3>
<p>▲Due to the Time Required to Prepare Canvas Bags</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is scheduled to implement inspection of exported raw silk on March 1. Due to insufficient preparation, the Jiangzhe silk mills elected four representatives, Huang Dianchen, Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, and Huang Jinfan, to go to Beijing with Director Zou to pay respects to Minister Kong and request a further extension of the implementation period. Minister Kong stated that the implementation of public weighing inspection of exported Chinese silk is purely for the sake of fair valuation for both parties in the development of trade between Chinese silk and foreign countries. It was originally scheduled to be implemented on February 1, but after representatives of Chinese silk merchants requested the ministry, it had already approved an extension of one month. If the extension is further delayed, it would affect the credibility of the Central Government, so it could not be approved. However, it was agreed that the exported factory silk within March would be temporarily exempted from inspection by the silk inspection office, with exemption forms issued to customs for inspection and release. It is now learned that the reason for the silk factory merchants' request for an extension this time is that factory silk packaging uses hemp bags lined with several layers of thick paper. When sent to foreign silk warehouses for weighing, there are frequent incidents of theft in transit, resulting in significant losses. After discussion among the industry, it was agreed to use canvas bags, seal the opening with a lacquer seal, and send the silk to the silk inspection office. After sampling is performed for baking inspection, it will be re-packaged and sealed to prevent theft. However, the preparation of these canvas bags takes time, and each factory must prepare at least forty or fifty bags, which takes about two weeks. Currently, manufacturers are in the process of preparing them.</p>
<h3>National Goods Factories Association Requests Posting of Stamp Duty</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factories Association sent a letter to its members yesterday, requesting them to comply with the regulations on posting stamp duty. The letter stated, "To whom it may concern, it has been notified by the Shanghai Provisional Court, the Merchants Group Consolidation Committee, and the Chinese Taxpayers Association in the concession that merchants in the concession should uniformly post stamp duty in accordance with the regulations, which we trust you are aware of. We are concerned that some factories may not be clear about the stamp duty amount and the posting method. We have sent a letter to the Shanghai Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Duty Bureau, requesting that 200 copies of the stamp duty regulations summary be sent to the association for distribution. We have received a reply stating that the items have been sent. We have attached the summary of the regulations to this letter. Please check and comply with the posting requirements to avoid omissions. "</p>
<h3>Representatives of All Shanghai Workers Petition for the Establishment of a General Trade Union</h3>
<p>Lu Jingshi and others, representatives of 800,000 workers in Shanghai, went to Beijing to petition for the establishment of a general trade union and issued a declaration, stating, "The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen established the policy of supporting agriculture and industry, hoping to assist the revolution, because agricultural and industrial workers are the people who most urgently need liberation and also the most advanced force in completing the revolution. After the reorganization of the party in the 13th year of the Republic, the organizational regulations for mass groups in various sectors were formulated. The late Dr. Sun Yat-sen was still concerned that their strength could not be concentrated and their command could not be unified, so he advocated having a supreme main organization to make up for this deficiency. Therefore, mass groups in various sectors, whether farmers, workers, students, merchants, women, etc., in addition to being organized separately by region, industry, or school, could gather together in provinces, cities, and counties to organize a supreme body. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. When the Northern Expedition started in the 15th year, it did not take many years to pacify the southeast and reach the Hebei River. Although it relied on the spirit of our leader and the sacrifice of armed comrades, the workers contributed the most blood and sweat in disrupting the rear of the warlords and destroying their positions. Taking this city as an example, when the advance troops of the revolutionary army had just arrived in Songjiang, the workers in the city immediately responded and fought the Zhilu [Zhili-Shandong] troops in the streets for several days and nights. In the battle of the North Station, bodies were scattered all over the place. This is because of the sincere belief in the Three Principles of the People and the leadership of the supreme organization. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. Now that the warlords in the country have been fortunately eliminated, the invasion of imperialism remains the same. In other words, the progress of the national revolution has only reached the first stage, and the freedom and equality of the nation cannot yet be realized. We should still actively train and continue to fight to complete the mission of the second stage. The city party headquarters, in view of this, after the end of the Trade Union Consolidation Committee, selected officers to prepare for the establishment of the Shanghai Special Municipality General Trade Union, so that the trade union organization can be unified and worker training can be easily implemented. Since the establishment of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai Special Municipality General Trade Union, it has been five months and will soon complete the consolidation of the city's trade unions. Legitimate and healthy trade unions account for about two-thirds or more of the city, with more than 800,000 people. They are expected to be established on schedule, and there is a leadership to rely on. Unexpectedly, news came that obstacles arose, and it was said that there was no legal basis or need under the current circumstances. The city's workers were shocked and alarmed. How was the performance of the workers in the city in the past revolutionary history, let alone. How can we violate the grand and great legacy of our late leader? Moreover, the supreme main organizations of students, farmers, merchants, and women have not been canceled, but there are different opinions on the workers alone. What is the intention? It is difficult to understand. Now the representatives, entrusted by the workers of the city, have gone to Beijing to petition, hoping that the central leaders are all believers who were personally taught by our late leader, and the party's fixed policy can be maintained without change. They should resolutely agree to the establishment of the general trade union that the workers in the city demand to be implemented immediately, so as to fulfill the unfinished wishes of our late leader. The representatives will swear to fight to the death as long as they are alive. This declaration is made on behalf of the petition delegation from the Shanghai Special Municipality Trade Unions, Lu Jingshi, et al."</p>
<h3>A Section of the Fire Brigade Raises Funds to Build a Building</h3>
<p>The Zhabei Fire Brigade in this port has leased its existing Huaxing Road premises since the first year of the Republic. The buildings have become extremely old. Although enthusiastic directors made separate contributions several years ago and purchased Site B at the intersection of Yongxing Road and Minde Road in preparation for building a new premises, it has not been completed due to funding issues. Now, the buildings on Huayu Road are about to be renovated, and it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the brigade submitted a request to the authorities to allow it to raise funds from all walks of life in the hope of collecting funds to build the premises. The city government has ordered its approval and ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to stamp the receipts for the donations for verification. It is now heard that the brigade distributed donation books last year, appealing to the directors and all walks of life to contribute. It is heard that the brigade has been very serious and has achieved remarkable results in fire prevention, so there is no lack of donors. The directors and volunteer members of the brigade are still working hard to solicit donations from all parties. Soon, they will be able to collect funds and discuss starting construction. Then the Zhabei fire prevention agency will have a permanent foundation.</p>
<h3>Street Vendor Merchants Strive to Organize Groups</h3>
<p>▲ Second Representative Congress Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Various trade groups in the city, including street vendors, brokers, and boat merchants, previously, due to a central government decree prohibiting the organization of groups by street vendors and merchants with mobility, had voluntarily convened meetings, organized the Shanghai Special Municipality Thirty-odd Commercial Group Joint Office, and actively requested assistance from various party, government, and military organs to be allowed to organize. Yesterday, they convened the second representative congress. Representatives from over thirty groups were present, including the Vegetable Stall Branch, Duck Vendor Branch, Book Stall Branch, Vegetable Produce Trade Association, Y庙豫园 Branch, Yarn and Thread Trade Zhizhong Society, Hu'nan Merchant Shipping Association, Shi'nan Vegetable Association, Hardware and Sundries Street Vendor Branch, Shanghai Fresh Medicine Trade Association, Shanghai-based Zhejiang Shipping Association, Hat Cleaning Association, French Concession Street Vendor Joint Association, and Jiangbei Shanghai Fresh Produce Transport Merchant Association. Shen Zhifu was elected chairman, and after formal proceedings, in addition to reporting on past work, it was decided to convene at 1:00 PM on the 5th of this month at No. 1 Tongchunfang, Qinglian Street, Xiaobeimen, with each group sending at least two representatives to petition the municipal government and the Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Rice Industry Wharf Construction Begins</h3>

However, due to funding issues, construction could not commence for a time. Rice industry colleagues believed that the procedures were now complete and that construction should begin as soon as possible and not be delayed. Therefore, Chairman Zhu requested engineers to survey the waterway at the site in recent days to check for obstructions. This has now been completed, so construction began yesterday.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Gao Ying Couple Appeal</h3>
<p>Regarding the Gao Ying couple's opium trafficking case, after Gao Ying and Gao Liao appealed, the High Court is currently investigating evidence. Because Gao Ying, during the first trial, completely blamed his wife, Liao Chengsu, for the opium trafficking, the details of the case must be clarified before a date for the continued trial can be set. The Ministry of Justice has requested that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs instruct the Consul General in Singapore to investigate Gao Ying's involvement in the case. The continued trial will be held once a response is received.</p>
<h3>Labor and Management Reach Understanding in Electrical Silk Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>▲ Coping Methods Amidst Gold Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>The local electrical silk weaving industry has been affected by gold price fluctuations. The market prices of rayon and wax thread, the raw materials needed for silk and other fabrics, have skyrocketed, increasing costs. However, the selling price of finished products has fallen from 90 cents per yard to 60 cents. Due to the situation in central Yangtze River and North China provinces, the demand from customers is very weak. In addition, each piece requires about two yuan in weaving labor, making losses significant. Companies with strong capital can afford to hold inventory and wait for prices to rise, but small and medium-sized factories find it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, reducing the scope of operations and output is becoming increasingly common. After repeated discussions among industry colleagues, it was believed that in this critical situation, the only option was to temporarily reduce wages and implement labor-management co-existence. Fortunately, the labor side was also able to understand the difficulties. As of yesterday, a fair solution has been proposed and has been agreed upon by the majority. Although a few still hold dissenting views, it is not expected to cause major problems. It is said that both sides demonstrated sincerity in the negotiations, leading to this positive outcome.</p>

Notifications have been sent to the county government for record and to the association and Mr. Jiang.</p>
<h3>Relief Workers from Jisheng Association Depart for Yueqing</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association recently received a respectful telegram from the Yueqing Disaster Relief Committee in the former Wenzhou prefecture, Zhejiang province, stating that the severity of the famine in Yueqing last year was unprecedented in centuries. Winter stores are exhausted, and the autumn harvest is awaited. The urgency of feeding the hungry far exceeds that of the past winter. Famine victims often want to borrow money to survive, but their possessions are already pawned. Or they try to leave the country to find food, but government orders forbid it. They are at a crossroads, with no way out. Hanging and drowning are often seen. They abandon their wives and children and steal food. Daytime robberies are rampant. In the mountains and fields, no smoke rises from cooking fires. On the streets and markets, beggars swarm like ants. The situation is so tragic that words cannot describe it. Your association has compassion for the hungry and suffering. If you can provide spring relief, so that the dying famine victims can recover, then your merits will be endless. Previously, the association, recognizing the severity of the disaster in Yongjia, Yueqing, and Yuhuan counties, publicly appointed General Director Feng Junyangshan to Yongjia, Director Li Yushu to Yueqing, and Gu Junqixian to Yuhuan to investigate and distribute spring relief. They departed from Haiyan by boat on March 1st, with more than thirty relief workers. The disaster victims are eagerly awaiting them, and the crisis can be quickly averted.</p>

Chen's parents died early. Because his monthly income is quite meager, he has not yet married. Last month, a familiar neighbor, the Tan couple from Huzhou at No. 5, told Chen that there was a fellow villager, Ms. Li, 22 years old, who had disagreements with her husband. A conflict had occurred previously, and she left in anger, wanting to separate from her husband. This has been the case for five or six years. She is now looking for a perfect man to entrust with her life. Since you have lived here as a tenant, you have been honest and kind, so we would like to introduce you to her. She does not require a large betrothal gift, only twenty or thirty yuan for clothes. Do not miss this opportunity. Chen was greatly moved and immediately agreed. On the 28th, the Tan couple brought Ms. Li to Chen's place. Chen was overjoyed to see that she was very beautiful. That night, they went to a hotel together for the night. The next morning, they returned home. The Tan couple said that since you like her character, you can give fifty yuan as a betrothal gift. Chen recalled that Tan had initially said that it would only cost twenty or thirty yuan, but now suddenly wanted fifty yuan, a difference of half, so he refused. Tan was angry at Chen's stinginess and immediately said, "If you don't agree, I will drag you and Ms. Li to the police precinct and accuse you of raping a married woman. How will you get rid of that?" Chen was now in a dilemma and had to reluctantly agree. Yesterday, at about 1:00 PM, Chen went to his sister's house at No. 63 Zhaojiawan in the South City to discuss the matter and ask for a loan for urgent needs. Unexpectedly, his sister not only refused to lend him money but also scolded him severely. Chen was extremely frustrated and had a momentary thought of ending his life. He immediately walked to the Bund outside Dongjiadu, lamented to the Huangpu River, and jumped in, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, Feng Deng'an, a guard at the 16th post, heard the sound and rushed to rescue him. He was saved and taken back to the First Section, First Branch of the precinct. After a preliminary interrogation by the chief, the case was reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for placement because it was a suicide attempt.</p>

<h3>Husband Meets Dancer, Wife Requests Divorce</h3>
<p>▲ Ten Years of Marriage, Now Celebrating Pregnancy</p>
<p>▲ Finding New Love, Forgetting Old Vows</p>
<p>▲ Heartbroken Tears in Court</p>
<p>▲ Judge Urges Both Parties to Reconcile</p>
<p>▲ After ten years of marriage, finally pregnant. Huang Chunsheng, a Shanghainese man serving in the French Concession’s Lukiawan police station, is from a modest family, but his family fortune is still controlled by his father. Chunsheng has five brothers, and he is the eldest. He married Chen Ruifen, and it has been ten years since. Chen is also thirty years old. She was not able to conceive before, but has recently become pregnant. ▲ A new love interest and the breakdown of affection. Their love was initially harmonious, but changed two years ago. Huang had an affair, and the idea of abandoning his wife germinated. Later, he went a step further and rented a house to hide his mistress, and carried out cohabitation. Chen learned that his cohabitation with his mistress was on the upper floor of Dr. Zhu Peping’s clinic at No. 143 Changsha Road. She went to negotiate, and the two even wrestled each other to the police station. Because it was a family dispute, it was not accepted.</p>
<p>▲ Filed for divorce last winter. Last winter, she hired lawyer Chen Tingrui and filed a lawsuit in the Temporary Court against Huang Chunsheng for doting on his mistress and abandoning his wife, and requested alimony. The petition stated that since marrying the defendant, things were peaceful at first.</p>
<p>▲ Cohabiting with a dancer. Around July and August of the year before last, the defendant had an affair with a dancer, rented a house at No. 143 Changsha Road, and carried out cohabitation. From then on, he rarely stayed at home, and often mistreated the plaintiff and did not provide support. Later, she noticed that the defendant had established another residence outside, so she politely advised him, but he not only did not listen, but also beat her.</p>
<p>▲ Head and legs were injured. On May 8, the defendant, along with his mistress and the mistress’s mother and sister, beat the plaintiff on the head and legs, turning her whole body blue and tearing her clothes. The plaintiff’s uncle, Wang Rujue, can testify to this.</p>
<p>▲ The conditions of the mediation were not fulfilled. Later, the defendant asked Wang Rujue to mediate and make an agreement, promising to pay household expenses of 280 yuan per month, and savings of 150 yuan, and another 10 yuan per week, totaling 474 yuan per month, and agreed to return home. However, he did not fulfill the above conditions.</p>
<p>▲ A weak woman cannot survive. Sometimes, when they met, a little bit of advice would lead to beatings. It is estimated that on August 5, August 7, October 18, and October 25, she was beaten one after another. All of these have doctor's certificates from Dr. Huang Rixiang and Bao Long Hospital and can be proven by witnesses such as servants, and Jiang Yushi, who tried to dissuade them in the field, was kicked. In addition, there were more than a dozen other beatings that were not treated by doctors and did not issue injury certificates. With such abuses and abandonments, it is impossible for a weak woman to survive, even if she wants to compromise and seek perfection.</p>
<p>▲ Please provide 60,000 yuan in alimony. According to the current law, it is in line with the conditions for forced divorce, and the reason for the divorce is due to the defendant's intention to assume responsibility for compensation and alimony. Therefore, it is requested that the divorce be granted and that 60,000 yuan in alimony and all dowry clothing and decorations be returned to the plaintiff, and that the defendant bears the cost of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>▲ And apply for monthly living expenses. After the petition was submitted, Lawyer Chen submitted another application, which requested that before the judgment in this case is finalized, the defendant be ordered to pay the monthly living expenses of 474 yuan per month, and not to delay it, in order to maintain livelihood.</p>
<p>▲ Defendant has moved to the French Concession. The court issued a subpoena to notify the date of the trial, but Huang Chunsheng and his mistress moved to the French Concession on November 19 of last year. Therefore, Huang has avoided appearing in court several times. The second landlord on Changsha Road, Dr. Zhu Shuping, was subpoenaed by the court to testify, but also avoided it on the pretext. A warrant has been issued for his arrest, and Zhu is now afraid.</p>
<p>▲ Heartbroken words and tears. On the afternoon of the other day, Judge Qu Cengze held another trial of the case. Zhu surrendered, and the defendant’s father, Huang, was also summoned to court. However, Huang Chunsheng still did not arrive. First, the plaintiff, Chen Ruifen, recounted the facts of being beaten and abandoned by her husband. When she got to the point of sadness, tears welled up.</p>
<p>▲ The old man said his daughter-in-law was too extravagant. He then questioned his father. He claimed that his eldest son Chunsheng had a mistress, who lived in Fangbanqiao, and he also knew about it. He did not know whether he had any affair now, and he was not dissatisfied with the extravagance of the plaintiff, saying that she had to go out every night, and that the watch she was wearing cost 160 yuan, which could be used to summarize the rest.</p>
<p>▲ If you want to return home, you don't need a lot of money. He said that his two or three sons were all married and had not been abused. Although there was little real estate, it was rented land to build houses. If the plaintiff wanted to return home, he didn't need to pay rent, and monthly expenses didn't need to be so much, and so on.</p>
<p>▲ The厢房tenants are the Li sisters. Then Zhu Shuping was questioned about the circumstances of renting a house to Huang Chunsheng. Zhu said that there was no Huang renting the house. The tenants living in the厢房 upstairs were the Li sisters. Because he was friends with Huang, he received the subpoena sent by the court on his behalf.</p>
<p>▲ Perjury will be prosecuted in another case. Judge Qu said that Huang Chunsheng's renting of a house from Zhu and cohabiting with his mistress had been clearly investigated by all parties, but Zhu still wanted to shirk his responsibility, which was extremely cunning. He immediately reprimanded him. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Tingrui, also stated that because Zhu's testimony was mostly false, the plaintiff would file a perjury case in another case.</p>
<p>▲ The judge earnestly persuaded reconciliation. Then Judge Qu enlightened the plaintiff and persuaded her to abandon the divorce lawsuit. His words were very thorough, saying that the plaintiff is now pregnant. If she gives birth to a son in the future, she may be able to restore the relationship between husband and wife. At this time, asking for a divorce, it is still uncertain who will win or lose, and after this piece of meat is born, there will be problems. Even if you win all the cases, the defendant will of course appeal, and vice versa, the plaintiff will inevitably appeal, which will only delay the time. And the alimony requested by the defendant will be useless if he has no assets. Therefore, for the benefit of the plaintiff, it seems better to withdraw the divorce lawsuit. After giving birth, if the defendant continues to abandon her, she can seek legal remedies again.</p>
<p>▲ Postponed for seven days to reconcile. Nai Chen Ruifen was deeply touched and could not easily wake up for a while. The court then gave both parties a chance to consider, postponing it for seven days, and ordered the defendant's attorney to notify the defendant to surrender at that time, so as to reconcile face-to-face. In case each other insists, another examination will be conducted. Both parties' lawyers expressed that they would obey the will of the court and persuade the parties to make concessions in order to fulfill the intention of settling the lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Meningitis Discovered in Yanghang</h3>
<p>▲ Forty to Fifty Patients</p>
<p>▲ Seven Deaths Already</p>
<p>Since the other day, meningitis, a popular disease, has suddenly been discovered in Yanghang Town, northwest of Wusong. The patients are all under the age of 20, with more children. The spread is quite rapid. As of yesterday, it was reported that forty or fifty people were infected with the disease, and seven people have died as a result. The four villages in the town are not included in this figure. The rest are currently being treated. The town belongs to the first district of Baoshan County. After receiving the report, District Chief Sun Qixian has contacted the Wusong Health Model District Office to request that doctors be sent to the town to handle treatment, disinfection, and other work. At the same time, he ordered the village chiefs to advise residents to get vaccinated to prevent the spread of the epidemic.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I was shocked to read a news item in the local news section of your newspaper on March 1, titled (Accountant Accused of Misappropriating Public Funds). I found that Yu is also one of the shareholders in the Sanxin Company. Due to disagreements, he requested to withdraw his shares, which led to a misunderstanding between the two parties. Today's reconciliation is feared to confuse the rumors and is related to Yu's reputation. Therefore, I write this letter to declare, hoping that your newspaper will publish it in the letter column, and I will be very grateful. Sincerely, Jiang Yuxiang March 2.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Special Municipality Municipal Government Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>(Year 18 of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>4. Regarding the Rectification of Land Matters: Land rectification is a key policy in the Outline of National Reconstruction and is most closely related to people's livelihoods. The work done in the past year can be summarized as follows: (1) Defining various rules: Equalizing land rights and improving land taxes are important land administration matters, and land registration is the foundation of equalizing land rights. Therefore, in October of the 18th year, draft regulations such as the Land Declaration Rules, the Land Valuation Committee Charter, and the Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Land Value Tax were formulated, and it is planned to implement them on a fixed schedule. Once registration is completed, the tax laws can be improved in accordance with the Three Principles of the People, based on the declared or estimated land values. (2) Clearing up municipally owned land: Municipally owned public land is scattered in various places, or has been lost track of due to age, leading to encroachment by the people. Without prior investigation and segmented survey, accurate statistics are difficult to obtain. Therefore, the Provisional Regulations for the Clearing of Municipally Owned Land were promulgated, along with attached forms, and issued to various districts for investigation and reporting. At the same time, the Simple Regulations for Rewarding People for Reporting Municipally Owned Land were also promulgated. Several locations have now been investigated and municipally owned land has been recovered. (3) Conducting surveys and measurements: The portion of this city formerly belonging to Baoshan County has been surveyed and measured by the former Baoshan County Land Survey Bureau. As for the portion belonging to Shanghai County, the survey and measurement is currently being continued by the former Shanghai County Land Survey Bureau. From August of the 16th year to December of the 18th year, the area that has been surveyed and measured totals 133,771 mu and 1 fen. Adding the area surveyed by the former Baoshan and other county land survey bureaus, the total is approximately 370,000 mu. Based on the current progress, the entire area should be surveyed and measured in another five years. The total area surveyed and measured in the 18th year was 52,368 mu. The method used is to first determine the meridian line and the longitude and latitude, and then determine the triangulation points within the scope of the land to be surveyed. Then, the main road lines are measured, and the topography is measured to connect the main road lines. Then, the branch road lines are measured. Based on the branch road lines, the household land is measured. At the same time, declaration forms are issued to notify each owner to fill in the old single mu fen, and the four address boundaries, as the basis for exchanging land certificates after the survey is completed. The surveyed map must be approved by the owner before it can be issued. The area is calculated using square meters as the standard to avoid ambiguity. As for the district, bao, tu, and embankment boundaries of the former Shanghai County, the errors are intertwined and the disputes are numerous. Moreover, the addresses and boundaries have been submerged due to changes in the terrain. After the topographic survey is completed, new maps, embankment numbers, and qiu boundaries must be re-divided and compiled for consolidation. (4) Issuing land practice certificates: As evidence of the people's property rights, for the old Shanghai portion, because the survey has been going on for a long time, the original certificates are numerous and scattered, and have been transferred, bought and sold, merged and divided, and have undergone many changes. The certificates and land are quite inconsistent, and disputes are often seen. Now, the rules for issuing land licenses and certificate patterns have been promulgated. For the surveyed districts, they will be filled out and issued first. For those who have not been surveyed but request a survey due to disputes, once the survey is completed, the land licenses will also be issued in advance. For the property transfer in the old Baoshan portion, the old certificates have also been cancelled and land certificates have been issued in exchange, with the aim of gradually unifying the system. (5) Consolidating title deeds: The original Shangbao Huizhang Foreign Merchant Lease Bureau has just been taken over by the Municipal Land Bureau and is now being actively consolidated. The issuance of Chinese merchant title deeds has been suspended, and the old lease agreements have been banned. All are required to apply for the transfer of title deeds within four months. If they fail to apply for the transfer of title deeds after the deadline, they will all be invalidated. All transfer procedures and title deed styles have been regulated. As for Chinese people using the names of foreign merchants to lease land, it must be fundamentally cracked down on, so as to achieve the goal of reducing foreign merchant land leases and protecting land rights. (6) Collecting taxes: Since the land tax has not been implemented, the collection of field tax is temporarily handled as before. However, the upper and lower mang silver are merged into one collection to save procedures, and separate grain counters are set up to facilitate the people. As for the tax assessment, because the Shangbao section rules were different in the past and the items were different, the additional levies were particularly complicated. We are now planning a unified method for consolidation. As for land transfer, the Municipal Land Bureau prints and distributes title deeds, which are handed over to the title deed distribution offices in each district to facilitate people to purchase and establish deeds nearby. The title deed tax price is also temporarily handled according to the previous regulations.</p>
<p>5. Regarding Social Relief Matters: In recent years, people's livelihoods have become increasingly impoverished, and society's material and psychological aspects are both showing signs of illness. The government, in view of this, is working hard on the following items: (1) Improving social livelihoods: (A) General livelihood improvement: Promoting various consumer cooperatives, running cooperative personnel training institutes, and exempting approved and registered cooperative business consumption taxes. In March of the 18th year, a Grain Committee was established to conduct citywide food stock statistics, and it was advocated to circulate food and reduce grain taxes. It was also suggested to allocate accumulated grain funds and property to prepare for the establishment of charity granaries, publicly stockpile grain to prevent merchant monopoly, and promulgate rules for rewarding increased rice and grain production to promote the increase of food production. In addition, such as preparing for the establishment of a Rent Dispute Arbitration Committee and organizing a Committee for the Construction of Civilian Housing, the first Civilian Living Place was built on Quanjia'an Road to gradually solve the housing problem, limit pawnshop interest rates, and create a Poverty-Stricken People's Lending Office to prevent the poor from being oppressed by high-interest loans. (B) Protecting industry and commerce: Establishing an Industrial Goods Testing Institute, opening a National Products Exhibition, establishing rules for rewarding emerging industrial products, engaging in surveys of commerce and industry, and holding registration of industrial and commercial groups to develop social economic strength. (C) Improving the lives of laborers: Holding trade union registration to improve the organization of labor groups, mediating labor-management disputes to maintain the livelihood of laborers, and also striving for labor statistics work. Surveys of the average monthly wages index, wage rate, cost of living index, retail price index, and strike statistics of factory workers have been compiled successively in order to properly solve labor problems. (D) Rewarding farming and eliminating insect pests: Organizing pest control committees in various districts, preparing to set up five cooperative pest control districts, and since cotton is the main agricultural product in this city, six agricultural cooperative testing districts were established to actively improve agriculture, and rules for tenant farmers to pay rent were promulgated to protect tenant farmers. (2) Remedying social defects: In addition to actively transforming the social environment, we are also engaged in relieving poverty as a passive relief. However, due to financial constraints and environmental restrictions, we deeply feel that things are not as desired. However, under the supervision of the Fifth Citywide Representative Assembly, strict supervision is implemented. Therefore, the registration of charitable organizations is handled. As of the 18th year, a total of 54 organizations have been registered. Laws and regulations on the disposal of property, the re-election of directors, and accounting matters have been promulgated successively in order to gradually consolidate and rectify nurseries and other charitable organizations, abolish Qingjie Halls, and prepare to transform women's training centers in order to adapt to social conditions and gradually become complete. (3) Reforming social malpractices: Measures have been formulated successively to limit birthday celebrations and wedding and funeral banquets and gift-giving. Public officials in various agencies in the city have taken the lead in advocating thrift, prohibiting welcoming gods and holding temple fairs, medicine prescriptions, and immortal prescriptions, and banning the parades of feudal retinues and the business of witches, shamans, and feng shui practitioners to enlighten the people, prohibit the old lunar calendar, and promote the new calendar to show innovation.</p>
<p>6. Regarding Public Security Administration Matters: This city is located at a key water and land transportation hub, and the police bear a heavy responsibility for maintaining public order. At this time when we are striving to recover judicial rights and complete local security, it is especially urgent. However, due to economic limitations, it has not been fully achieved as expected. The work done in the past year can be summarized as follows: (1) Expanding preparedness: The city's Public Security Bureau has jurisdiction over the original seven districts and twenty-two stations, as well as security, water patrol, and detective teams. Each district has one district chief, each station has one station chief, and each team has one team leader. Last year, one district member was added to each district, and patrol officers were added to important districts and stations. The number of police was increased by a total of 24 classes. In addition, four sub-stations and ten district police stations were added to increase police force. The original security team was changed to a police brigade to unify the water police authority in the urban area. The original water patrol team was expanded and a general team with four sub-teams and eight police stations was established to complete water security. Detectives were added to fulfill the duties of investigation and visiting. (2) Enriching equipment: The City Public Security Bureau was reorganized from the Songhu Police. At the beginning of its establishment, only two or three tenths of the equipment needed for public security remained. Now, we are gradually restoring the original state by finding ways to replenish it. In addition, steel vests and copper helmets have been added, and bicycles and motorcycles have been purchased to facilitate patrols. Furthermore, telephone private lines have been installed in the entire third district of Pudong to facilitate communication. (3) Training police officers: Police officers have heavy responsibilities and complex matters. It is difficult to expect them to be qualified without proper training. Therefore, the police training institute was expanded.</p>
<p>Also, service guidelines were compiled and distributed to police officers to improve the level of police knowledge. (4) Maintaining peace and tranquility: The residents of this city come from all directions, and there are special zone relations. It is easiest for ordinary criminals and unruly elements to hide and always think of taking advantage of opportunities. In addition, labor-management disputes often arise in various industries. In the middle, after the memorial days of August 1, August 8, September 5, and September 25, the Municipal Public Security Bureau took strict precautions, and fortunately there were no accidents. In addition, 108 cases of theft, 15 cases of kidnapping, and 79 other cases of carrying firearms, distributing leaflets, and reactionary intimidation were uncovered. 171 reactionary publications were seized. 3,575 gatherings and associations were supervised. 62 labor disputes were mediated and maintained. 16 batches of refugees passing through the border were aided. 251 lost women and children were handled. 61 vagrants were detained and sent to charitable organizations. (5) Handling foreign affairs, such as prohibiting the dumping of garbage from concessions into the Suzhou River, stopping the construction of roads beyond the boundary of Wusong Road, Haishan Road, and Da Xi Road, demolishing the iron fences set up by foreigners on Zhongzhou Road, withdrawing the Western police gatekeepers from Yuqingfang on Sichuan Road, and handling 24 cases of foreign vehicles driving into the Chinese area. (6) Reporting criminal cases: The Municipal Public Security Bureau has the power to search, arrest, conduct preliminary trials, and send criminal offenders. From July of the 17th year to June of the 18th year, a total of 3,544 cases of theft, extortion, injury, adultery, abduction, fraud, smuggling, private smoking, and other criminal cases were uncovered and sent to the Shanghai Local Court for trial according to law. In addition, from July of the 17th year to June of the 18th year, the Municipal Public Security Bureau accepted a total of 1,727 cases of violations of police regulations. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Madame Huangpi's Love for Flowers and Plants</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Madame Li Huangpi passed away in Tianjin a few days ago. Her beautiful talent suddenly sank. Her fragrant reputation disappeared suddenly. All the newspapers in Pingjin competed to report on the matter. It is said that Madame usually loved to grow flowers and plants. In addition to hiring flower servants to irrigate and cultivate, she also assigned maids to pick off dead leaves and remove pests, protecting them with great care. However, Madame did not like Western flowers. Those who gave them to her would always give them to female friends, saying that although foreign flowers were extremely gorgeous, they lacked charm and were not worth appreciating carefully. When Huangpi was in charge, many guests and colleagues knew that Madame had a passion for flowers and plants, and they often brought famous varieties. Madame planted them one by one in the back garden of her residence. There were "fish's egg" peonies, the color was extremely beautiful, with more than ten branches, each flower resembling a purse. The gentle and unrestrained springtime was occupied by the spring breeze. It bloomed at the same time as ordinary peonies. There was also "variegated" rose, mixed with five colors, the flowers were as big as cups. When in full bloom, the fragrance was thick and fragrant, and could be smelled within a mile or two. However, it was easy to get drunk from the fragrance, and one did not dare to sit under the flowers for a long time. There were also yellow begonias, the petals were like those made of twisted wax, with a charming and fragrant aura. If Zeng Nanfeng knew, he would not have to hate the begonias for having color but no fragrance. There were more varieties of chrysanthemums, including jade balls, crane crest red, jade rabbit flowers, agate plate, jasper river glow, Drunken Concubine Yang, brocade belt knot with a heart, and other famous varieties. When the flowers bloomed in late autumn, she often picked them and stored them in old winter melons that had been emptied, and then sealed them with mulberry paper. This year, on New Year's Day in the old calendar, Madame still took fresh chrysanthemums and gave them to relatives and family members. But not long after, she fell ill, and the illness eventually caused her death. It is inevitable that people will have the feeling that the flowers fall and the person dies.</p>
<h3>The Venom of Rats</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>The local news of this newspaper reprinted the Shanghai Times, saying that on Tuesday night, at a certain residence at No. 36, Taiheng Lane, North Sichuan Road, a seven-year-old child was bitten on the lower lip by a rat, and the bleeding did not stop. It is known that this kind of rat is still small, and one of the largest was seen. It did not avoid or fear, but suddenly moved forward to bite its mother, causing very serious injuries. It is truly a strange story. The mother and son were both sent to the hospital and reported to the Chinese Health Bureau. The bureau sent people with rat traps and other equipment to search for and capture the rats, but only two or three small rats were caught. The neighbors nearby all said that they often saw giant rats appearing, so everyone was alarmed, thinking that even if this rat was hit, it would still escape, and there would definitely be disasters in the future.</p>
<p>I say that the largest of rats is no greater than the rats in a certain place in Suiyuan, which were reported in various newspapers in the past. Some weighed more than ten kilograms, and they appeared in groups in broad daylight. However, it has not been heard that they bite people with their teeth. Occasionally, what is seen is that when people are sound asleep, they are bitten on the soles of their feet by rats, only injuring their skin, which is commonly said to be unlucky, but there is no great harm.</p>
<p>Only one kind of rat is called "鼷鼠." According to the "Shuowen Jiezi," its shape is extremely small. The "Yupian" also says that it has stinging poison and eats people, as well as birds and beasts, without causing them pain. It is also called (甘口鼠) ("sweet-mouthed rat"). The "Erya Shishou" says that the 鼷鼠 has stinging poison. "Bowu Zhi" says that because of its fine shape, it is also called (耳鼠) ("ear rat"). In the spring of the seventh year of Duke Cheng of Lu, 鼷鼠 ate the horns of the sacrificial cattle in the suburbs. Li Xun's annotation in "Bencao" also says that it eats people and the skin of cattle and horses, causing sores, and they do not realize it until they die. Then this rat is very harmful. Now, a certain child was bitten by a rat that is small, and his mother was bitten by a rat that is extremely large. How is the wound? We must wait for the report from the hospital to know, and we cannot make a judgment in advance. I say, examining the past, there are things even worse than the plague (鼠疫). In the future, the rat disaster will probably also be a major issue of public safety, and health experts should not take it lightly.</p>
<h3>A Record of Exploring the Plum Blossoms at Lingfeng</h3>
<p>— Song Lu, sent from Hangzhou</p>
<p>I am ashamed to say that I, who have been a neighbor of West Lake for more than two years, have not yet been to Lingfeng. Half of the reason is because I am busy and lazy, and the other half is because Lingfeng is a remote place and not much noticed. Friends all praise the plum blossoms of Lingfeng, which are far better than those of Gushan. Therefore, I couldn't help but yearn for it. Coincidentally, my friend Zhiwen invited me to visit Yuquan, so I took the opportunity to go to Lingfeng. After admiring the scenery, I was indeed very satisfied.</p>
<p>I hired a car at the lakeside, and within ten minutes, it took me to Yuquan. Yuquan is a Zen temple. Although it is on this secluded road, because there are colorful giant fish attracting people inside, tourists come in droves. We walked to the Fish Paradise Pond. As usual, the monks brewed spring tea and brought two dishes of noodles. Zhiwen threw the noodle bait into the pond, attracting the fish to come and snatch it. As a result, the entire noodle cake was always snatched away by the big fish, and the remaining noodle crumbs were only for the small fish to lick. In fact, is it not the same with human beings in this world? After watching for a while, we asked the monk for directions to Lingfeng. The monk told me that it was more than two miles away from the main road. If you cross the mountain path, you can get there in half the distance. So I asked the monk to guide us. The monk asked the receptionist for instructions and then accompanied us along the mountain road. Although the mountain path was not very rugged, it made us all tired. The monk led us across the mountain and onto the main road, and then said goodbye and left.</p>
<p>We hadn't walked a few steps when the stone archway came into view. The two characters (Lingfeng) had already caught our eyes. Upon arriving, we saw sparse winter plums on both sides, just waiting to bloom, and we couldn't help but raise our spirits. Moving forward, we arrived at the temple gate. We entered the main hall, but we had no intention of browsing the Buddha statues. We went straight out through a small door on the side. What a beautiful plum garden! But the land is not very wide, the plums are not very many, but they are planted very appropriately. Among them, there are about fifty plum trees, nineteen of which are still budding, both red and white. What is even more special is the so-called green calyx plum. I have seen dozens of plum blossoms over the years, but this green calyx plum is the only one I have ever seen. We chose a place with dense plum blossoms to sit down. The tea server brewed tea, and the taste of the tea was no less than that of Yuquan. There is a pond in the garden. The pond water is whitish. The area of the pond is similar to that of the Ink Pond in Shaoxing East Lake, but it has a special charm. After sitting for a while, a photographer came to solicit business. We took two pictures without saying yes or no. Seeing that the time was getting late, we urged Zhiwen to return early. When leaving, the monk gave me two branches of red plum blossoms, which were fragrant and lovely. We returned to Yuquan along the way and hired rickshaws to Gushan to take a boat. After seeing the plum blossoms of Lingfeng, when we looked at the plum blossoms of Gushan again, we didn't feel the distinction between the big and small sorcerers. After a hasty stroll, we returned by boat.</p>

<h3>Random Notes from a Trip to America in Zhu Yuxuan (I)</h3>
<p>— Seattle Correspondence</p>
<p>Mei Wan Hua left the country for a month. He arrived safely in New York on February 8th. He went on stage on February 18th to perform his art. He received a warm welcome from the people of that country. It was extremely prosperous for a while. The situation is roughly as described in the special dispatches from various news agencies. I won’t repeat it here. I will extract some trivial news about the travels and banquets along the way. It is also a comfort to those who know.</p>
<p>On January 18th, he took the Canadian ship from Shanghai at noon. On the 21st, he arrived in Kobe and landed. There was a grand welcome. That evening, he transferred by train. The next day, he arrived at Tokyo Station. Chinese and Japanese welcomers gathered. In the afternoon, the Baron Okura's welcome party was originally scheduled to have 600 guests. Because the Diet was in session, they flocked to the event, exceeding the number of seats by more than 200. Wan Hua delivered a speech. A song celebrating both plum blossoms and cherry blossoms was specially composed at the venue. Because cherry blossoms are the national flower of Japan, the juxtaposition of plum blossoms and cherry blossoms is meant to honor them. The lyrics are translated into Chinese and printed and distributed. The lyrics say:</p>
<p>The spring breeze is gentle. Plum blossoms and cherry blossoms are fragrant together. Heavenly fragrance and national beauty. Auspicious light. Flowers cover the mountains and mornings. Ten thousand miles of travelers. Fragrant clothes and hairpins. Heaven and earth are full of spring. Plum blossoms are the first to bloom in spring. Orchids are fragrant and pleasant. Elegant ladies of the cherry blossom country. Welcome distinguished guests. Immortal birds and jade trees. Harmony brings auspiciousness. Wear plum blossoms as a crown. Wear orchids</p>
<p>as a skirt. The flowers cover the whole body. Spring is boundless.</p>
<p>The famous female singer Murata Kazuko performed a welcome dance. The venue for the welcome was also decorated with plum blossoms and cherry blossoms. Later, he responded to the banquet of the Chinese Minister Wang. And broadcast a radio speech. Tokyo Imperial Theatre's famous actors, Moriguchi Kanmi and Murata Kazuko, had previously visited Beiping together. They received special assistance from Mei. Now that they are reunited in one hall, they are sincerely overjoyed to meet in a different place. After leaving Japan, he lived on the ship. Wan Hua did not get seasick at all. His spirits were exceptionally lively. Except for breakfast, he went to the dining room for lunch and dinner every day. There were many sports facilities on the ship, such as rowing machines, horseback riding, and bicycles. Wan Hua was able to use them all. He enjoyed driving them in the morning and evening. The captain often came to greet him in person. And gave special treatment to all the gentlemen who traveled with him.</p>
<p>January 31st. Arrived in Seattle. Wan Hua and part of the delegation stayed at the Summer Pacific Hotel. Most of the others stayed at the Madden Hotel. When the ship arrived in Victoria, the overseas Chinese representatives from New York and San Francisco, Chen Yuedong, Bing Shun, Situ Can, and many local overseas Chinese, came to the ship to greet them. They went ashore at noon. They first toured the city for a week and rested briefly at the Chinese Association. At about 4 o'clock, they changed to a small boat. Seattle at nine o'clock at night. News reporters came to visit in droves. After a brief chat, he cleaned up and went to bed. After a long voyage, he was able to rest a little. This time, the Seattle Immigration Bureau officials did not create any difficulties for Wan Hua and others to enter the country. It was really rare.</p>
<h3>European Travel Correspondence (43)</h3>
<p>— Liu Haisu</p>
<p>▲The Fauves (Part 1)</p>
<p>Most of my life in Paris is spent looking at the Musée des Beaux-Arts, the art galleries, from Giotto to Botticelli, from Titian to Fragonard, from Poussin</p>
<p>all the way to David. From Ingres all the way to Cézanne. I have no questions and hold a humble and indifferent heart. I feel the characteristics of each era of art without any worries. Or in the Spanish painting room of the Louvre, walking to the rooms of the Dutch writers. Although each has its own distinct characteristics, they never surprise me. Even after seeing the Louvre, I walked to the Luxembourg Palace to see modern works. There was nothing particularly exciting. After walking through several art galleries each time, I was always provoked endless inner changes. Sometimes I am lost, sometimes I am enlightened. This is very meaningful. There are more than a thousand art galleries in Paris. What they sell, exhibit, and display are all works of the Fauvism school. There are also very few works of Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. The French art scene of the 20th century has long been occupied by the Fauves. That is, the Salon d'Automne and the Salon des Artistes Indépendants or the Salon des Tuileries. Although they each have different natures, representing the current art of France. But if you look closely at the important works inside, most of them are from the hands of the great figures of the Fauvism school. This can be imagined in general. The term Fauvisme has been discovered for twenty years. But probably not many people understand its meaning now. This situation is not surprising in China, where knowledge of Western art history is extremely naive. What Impressionism and Post-Impressionism have become things of the past in the European art scene. In China, how many people who hang the sign of an artist can understand clearly. Then how can they understand the Fauvism school that arose in opposition to Post-Impressionism. Moreover, the Fauvism school is relatively difficult to understand. From this point of view, my introduction of the Fauvism school now is inevitably somewhat out of date. But from another point of view, this introduction seems very important. The new art of the West is constantly being transmitted to China in fragments. The chaotic situation is really confusing. Some fashionable people casually pick up a little to talk about Cézanne, Van Gogh, Matisse, and Cubism. Futurism. In fact, they have never understood it. They are just trying to be novel and sensational. There are also some people who close their eyes and scream wildly. Advocating the description of external forms. Advocating the dead skills of the official school. These are all tens of thousands of miles away from Western new art. Even though they are enthusiastic about spreading it. But in reality, the distance is so far that there is no beneficial result. Modern art has the nature of the world. There is no national boundary. The reason why we study Western art now is not because it originated in the West. It is also because it contains the nature of the world. To understand the emerging art. It is also recognizing him as a relatively radical process in the development of art with world properties. The modern era is not the era of Zong Bing and Wang Wei. It is not the era of mountain forest hermits closing their doors and wielding pens. All thoughts are stimulated with the nature of the world. You cannot but accept the mixing. Therefore, to talk about art, you cannot but understand the modern new art thought trend. It is not enough to understand some forms. We must also explore his fundamental spirit. When everything is clear. We must re-evaluate a value for our inherent art. There is also an interest in joining the world's art trend and moving forward with others. Otherwise, we will only close our eyes and shout for national art. Selling antiques. Naturally, you can only fall behind step by step. Because our ancestors' great legacy is a kind of glory in history. Now we also have to work hard to start a business. But what is the fundamental spirit of modern European art? It can be said that it is the spirit of the Fauvism school. To understand the true essence of modern art. You should first understand the process of the Fauvism school.</p>
<h3>Republican Bird</h3>
<p>— Ji Jin</p>
<p>There is a cypress tree in Dushu Village, Xixiang, Huzhou. It is about a hundred feet tall and can be embraced by four or five people. The branches and leaves are lush and look like a canopy. It is said to be an antique from hundreds of years ago. There are nests built on it. There are no less than a hundred. Some are clumsy like doves. Some are strange like owls. Some are fierce like eagles. Some are delicate like skylarks. They grow here. They do not kill each other. Even the matter of finding food and breastfeeding. Other species can be asked to do it for them. And the villagers give it a good name. Collectively call it the Republican Bird.</p>
<p>One day. Suddenly a strange bird arrived. It was as big as a Peng. It pounced directly at the top of the tree. The Republican Birds joined forces to resist. The big ones were in the front. Those who were not in the front were in the back. They charged and faced off. As if facing a great enemy. After about an hour. The strange bird finally lost its strength alone. Flew away into the distance. At that time, when collecting the remnants of the army, it was seen that a small number of the same kind had fallen to the ground. Those who were injured and could not fly. Then they were taken back to their nests one by one. The villagers admired its courage and righteousness. They spread the word widely. Within a hundred miles. Everyone knows the name of the Republican Bird. Alas! Can humans be inferior to birds?</p>

<h3>Recent Farce Regarding Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>English, Japanese, and Russian Men Act in Harbin</p>
<p>*The China Weekly Review* reports that an English car dealer in Harbin sold a car to a Russian chauffeur, Mr. A, using an installment payment plan. After obtaining the car, the Russian, due to poor business, pawned the car to a Japanese man to get money for his own use. The English dealer only received the first installment. After finding out the Japanese buyer's name, he sued him in the Japanese consulate (because the Japanese enjoyed consular jurisdiction). The Japanese consulate ignored it, claiming the car was bought legally and no crime was committed.</p>
<p>The English dealer, unable to get anywhere, waited for an opportunity. One day, when the Japanese man parked his car on the road, the Englishman drove it back to his shop and locked it up. The Japanese car owner sued the Englishman in the English consulate, accusing the Englishman of stealing the car. The English consulate also ignored it, saying the car was originally the Englishman's property and the full price had not been paid. (Furthermore, "I, an Englishman, sued you in your consulate, and your consulate ignored it.")</p>
<p>The Japanese man, unable to get justice, also waited for an opportunity. One day, seeing the Englishman's own car parked on the road, the Japanese man sneaked into the car and drove it away, claiming it as his own. Because this car was more valuable than the other car, the Japanese man used it to blackmail the English dealer even more. It is said that the English and Japanese consuls also had a falling out because of this and no longer spoke to each other. This can be called a farce of consular jurisdiction, with both the English and Japanese sides playing key roles. The Russian chauffeur, who no longer enjoys consular jurisdiction, seems to have disappeared.</p>
<p>This matter was reported in a Harbin dispatch published in a foreign newspaper in Shanghai. The dispatch did not explain why the Chinese authorities did not investigate the Russian. Perhaps the Chinese are rich in humor and deliberately ignore it, so that the lesson of consular jurisdiction disputes will not be completely lost on foreigners.</p>
<h3>Fascist White Terror</h3>
<p>Son of Former Italian Prime Minister Writes Book Against Fascism</p>
<p>London Bookstore Receives Threatening Letters</p>
<p>London dispatch: The London firm of Chapman &amp; Hall, a well-known old bookstore in England, founded in New York a century ago, and later establishing a branch in England, has published many works by famous English and American writers of the 19th century. Recently, it was threatened by the Italian Fascist Party. The reason is that Francesco Nitti, the son of former Italian Prime Minister Nitti, was imprisoned in a reformatory on the island of Lipari for opposing Mussolini's policies and suffered all kinds of ill-treatment. Nitti escaped last July and settled in London. He wrote a book about his arrest and escape, titled "Escape," with a preface by his father, and submitted it to Chapman &amp; Hall for printing and publication.</p>
<p>Recently, the company placed large advertisements in newspapers in England and the United States to announce it in advance. Since the advertisements were published, Mr. Chapman, the owner of the company, has received several threatening letters from Paris. One letter stated that if the book was published, the company would be blown up immediately, and Mr. Chapman's life would be in danger. ("No matter where you hide, a clever Fascist revenge will follow you.") Another letter stated that "Fascists will never allow such excess. We and our comrades in New York have our own methods of dealing with it. The rotten police in New York cannot guarantee that your store will not be bombed into ashes with two bombs. We have notified our comrades in New York. For your own safety, you must not publish Nitti's book."</p>
<p>The letters were signed "Fascists in Paris." Some letters were in Italian, some in English. One letter was signed "A Blackshirt," and another was signed "Fascist Executive Department." After receiving the letters, Mr. Chapman reported to Scotland Yard. Detectives were assigned to protect him. According to Mr. Chapman, he has no intention of interfering with the publication of this book. He said that if there is a book on Fascism, he can also publish it. He also joked that he is not against Fascism, but he would like to be in the ranks of those who support "the disarmament of Fascists who threaten publishers." This can be considered an amusing anecdote.</p>
<h3>Increase in Sunspots and Recent Cosmic Changes</h3>
<p>Clear Physical Relationship Between the Sun and the Earth</p>
<p>According to Dr. Yamamoto Issei, a Japanese physicist, the activity of sunspots in the past six months has been as follows: Solar activity has been increasing since 1924. In 1928, it experienced the third peak of this century. Since then, there has been no sign of a sudden decline. In particular, the latitude of the sunspots is low in both the north and south, and their various effects on the Earth are clearly visible.</p>
<p>As shown in the table below, the number of sunspots suddenly increased sharply in mid-August of last year. It then calmed down in early autumn. From October, it increased slightly and continued to rise. In mid-December, it exceeded 164, reaching an unprecedented peak. Although there was a decline afterward, it rose slightly again this year. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future, but this unusually large increase is very significant.</p>
<p>Various cosmic changes occurred on Earth at the same time as the increase in sunspots. From the end of November to mid-December last year, central Japan continued to be warm for several days, which was rare in the past thirty or forty years, while Manchuria, China, was extremely cold. In particular, during this season, central Europe experienced rare blizzards and cold waves that had not been seen in forty or fifty years. The United States also saw aurora borealis accompanied by magnetic storms. Also, from early November, in the Okayama and Oita areas of Japan, an unusual zodiacal light could be seen almost every night in the eastern sky.</p>
<p>Magnetic storms and aurora borealis were also observed in mid-August. A part of it was seen and marveled at by passengers and crew members of the Zeppelin airship flying over the wilderness of Siberia. This also coincided with a temporary increase in sunspots in mid-August. The physical relationship between the sun and the earth is clearly presented in this way, which is truly remarkable. The table of sunspot activity is attached below:</p>
<p>Time Relative Number of Sunspots</p>
<p>July last year: early 95.2, mid 96.4, late 92.8</p>
<p>August last year: early 76.6, mid 126.9, late 58.7</p>
<p>September last year: early 33.8, mid 46.9, late 37.7</p>
<p>October last year: early 72.0, mid 50.7, late 59.9</p>
<p>November last year: early 79.1, mid 85.8, late 96.6</p>
<p>December last year: early 126.9, mid 164.7, late 145.3</p>
<p>Early January this year: 74.4, mid 114.7</p>
<h3>Trade Between Japan and Russia Increases Rapidly</h3>
<p>Approximately Fivefold Increase in Three Years</p>
<p>Tokyo dispatch: Japan's export trade to Russia has developed rapidly since the establishment of the Russian Trade Delegation. Last year, it exceeded 15 million yuan (15,123,000), an increase of about five times compared to three years ago. Among them, fishing nets and gear (1 million yuan) and green tea (5 million yuan) are the main items. Currently, the Russian Trade Delegation, under the order of the Supreme Economic Council, has extended the credit period for export bills from six months to a long-term nine-month period and notified Japanese merchants. The reason given is that the current credit periods in the Czech Republic (shortest six months, longest thirty-six months), Germany (thirty-six months), the United States (twenty-four months), and France (twelve months), are all longer than Japan's (six months), which hinders trade between Japan and Russia.</p>

<h3>London's Population Has Increased Sharply in Recent Years</h3>
<p>The House Building Industry Has Flourished Accordingly</p>
<p>London dispatch: According to the British Ministry of Health, London has been developing more and more in recent years. The population density is increasing, setting a new record. In the past three years, the population in the "Greater London" area has increased by 614,900 people. A total of 123,792 new houses have been built. Since 1920, a total of 230,760 new houses have been built in the area, which is more than one-sixth of the 1,408,025 new houses built in England and Wales during the same period. In addition, the house building industry in the rural areas around London has also developed greatly in recent years, especially in the Hendon district. The figures are compared as follows:</p>
<p>Year  Population  Houses</p>
<p>1926  71,111  14,640</p>
<p>1927  75,747  15,749</p>
<p>1928  89,871  19,128</p>
<p>1929  116,672 23,000</p>
<h3>Oil Production Restrictions in California, USA, Further Extended</h3>
<p>Affecting the Kerosene Market in Various Countries</p>
<p>US restrictions on kerosene production are affecting markets in various countries. According to recent US news, Oklahoma has decided to extend the restriction period, which was originally scheduled to end at the end of last year, to the end of March this year. The restriction period in California, which was originally scheduled to end at the end of January, has also been decided to be extended for a certain period. The results have attracted considerable attention. The situation of US oil production since the implementation of the restrictions is as follows:</p>
<p>December 29, 1928: 2,581,050 barrels (world's highest record)</p>
<p>August 31, 1929: 2,973,450 barrels (even higher record)</p>
<p>October 12: 2,840,000 barrels (reduction due to the implementation of oil production restrictions in the central land area starting on September 14)</p>
<p>November 16: 2,620,000 barrels (significant reduction due to the start of restrictions in California starting on November 1)</p>
<p>December 2: 2,610,000 barrels</p>
<p>The dates and figures in the table above represent the average daily production for the week ending on that date. In addition, the oil production situation in January this year has fluctuated since December.</p>
<h3>China's Seven-Li Silk Exports to Japan Increase</h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Machine Operators Find It Cost-Effective to Use</p>
<p>According to the *Tokyo Asahi Shimbun*, the Tariff Deliberation Council has decided to reduce the current tariff of 25% by 10% to 15%. Due to the low silver price, Chinese seven-li silk is cost-effective even after paying a tariff of 25%. Therefore, since this spring, Chinese silk merchants and Japanese machine operators have been in repeated contact. Recently, about 200 bales of silk costing 600 yuan each have been imported. Some Japanese local machine operators have had to suspend operations due to the low price of woven fabrics in the market. Depending on the future silver market situation, a considerable amount of imports are expected. Furthermore, the reduction of tariff rates will further promote this trend.</p>
<h3>Chinese Silk Exports to the United States Increase</h3>
<p>Exports Formerly Destined for Europe Are Diverted to the United States</p>
<p>According to a recent survey, Chinese silk production has increased due to the low silver price. Furthermore, due to the sluggish silk industry in Europe, exports formerly destined for Europe have been diverted to the Americas. From the beginning of the new silk season last year, the export volume of Chinese silk in the last nine months was 124,117 bales, an increase of 11,800 bales compared to the same period last year. Among them, shipments to Europe decreased by 17,671 bales, and shipments to the United States increased by 27,684 bales. The contents of the increase in exports to the United States are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Guangdong raw silk exports increased by 13,639 bales.</p>
<p>2.  Shanghai machine-reeled silk exports increased by 8,969 bales.</p>
<p>3.  Tussah silk exports increased by 2,579 bales.</p>
<p>4.  Floss silk exports increased by 2,479 bales.</p>

<h3>English Woman Helps Gandhi Resist England</h3>
<p>According to Indian newspapers, an important assistant in Gandhi's political and social work is an Englishwoman, Miss Slade. Slade is the daughter of Rear Admiral Slade, former commander-in-chief of the British East Indies Fleet. She joined Gandhi's staff four years ago. Gandhi lives in the Ahmedabad area and is extremely busy every day. Hundreds of people come from all over to see him every day. Gandhi often feels tired and often says to his guests, "Please wait twenty minutes so that I can rest a little and then talk to you." His bed is set up in the shade of a tree, and Gandhi takes a nap in front of the guests to rest.</p>
<p>Everyone in Gandhi's house gets up at 4:30 every morning and gathers for prayer, filling the air with Sanskrit chanting, and then begins to work. Meals are served twice a day. The food is vegetables, fruits, milk, and cheese. Everyone must spin a certain amount of cotton yarn every day. All clothes are made of Indian cloth. Miss Slade first met Gandhi when her father was in India. Later, after returning to England, she felt very unhappy and sought advice from the French philosopher Rolland. Rolland advised her to cooperate with Gandhi. Miss Slade followed his advice.</p>
<p>Miss Slade said in her diary that she found peace and tranquility in Gandhi's home. Miss Slade, except for frequent correspondence with her mother, has completely broken away from her home country. She wears Indian clothes, eats Indian food, and wholeheartedly serves Gandhi. Gandhi recently sent Miss Slade to salt fields and factories across the country to organize a non-cooperation movement against England. It is expected that the first war between Gandhi and England will be a war over the salt monopoly.</p>
<h3>The Letters of Elizabeth Barrett Browning Chang Xi</h3>
<p>The love between the poets Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett is considered the most fulfilling love story of literary figures. They had no other romantic experiences before falling in love. After falling in love, they remained harmonious until death, without any rifts, making them a couple envied and praised by many literary figures. Everything about the two poets is worth noting.</p>
<p>After Elizabeth Barrett Browning fled her family to Italy to get married, she could not get her family's sympathy. Even her sister seemed dissatisfied with her behavior. However, her sister later escaped from the family to gain the freedom to marry, which resonated with her. Therefore, while praising her sister's courage, she wrote many long and interesting letters to her sister. In the recently published letters from Elizabeth Barrett Browning to her sister, edited with deep consideration by Leonard Huxley—letters from 1846 to 1859, over eleven years—we can glimpse the poet's married life and her feelings for her sister.</p>
<p>All the letters written during these eleven years were written after her marriage to the poet in 1846. In the letters, she wrote many passionate words (dear, dear, dearest), but she could not completely conceal the past events that were weighing on their minds. All the letters were postmarked from Italy, and she also reported to her sister, who lived far away in England, about the dilapidated state of Italy at that time, which was not recorded in many historical records.</p>
<p>Among them, the description of her and the poet's sweet life is worth cherishing. It was in her report to her sister after they had a unique child. She said, "Between us, there is now a deeper love than ever before. He believes in me deeply, and I believe in him deeply. He is closely approaching me, and I am approaching him in the same way... Our hearts are forever in tune, and we live in tune every day... We are truly happy, and God is worth praising." These simple sentences have also exhausted the sweet life of the "advocates of love supreme" praised by Dr. Kushi Hyakuson.</p>
<h3>The Question of Widows Remarrying Zhuo Jun</h3>
<p>The recently published *Life Weekly* has an article documenting the marriage of Mr. Zhang Yiou and Ms. Wu Zhen, and heavily praises them as "a courageous and virtuous couple." This is something that deserves our attention.</p>
<p>Indeed, a man who has lost his wife has the right to remarry, and a woman who has lost her husband should also have the right to remarry. Speaking from the perspective of egalitarianism, this can be considered absolutely unhindered and unpreventable. Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wu were unwilling to give up their inherent rights, and we can glimpse their spirit in this.</p>
<p>If we were to follow the path of man-eating ritualism today, how could Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wu have produced such a result?</p>
<p>In particular, it has been a long-standing custom in our China that women who have lost their husbands are not allowed to remarry, as it is believed that remarriage is a loss of chastity, and women who have lost their chastity are looked down upon. "Better to starve to death than to lose chastity" has been cast into the golden rule for widows. In our mainland China, it is still the same. If you marry a widow, you will be seen as a vulgar person. Mr. Zhang married Ms. Wu, who had been a widow for more than twenty years, and she was also the sister of the deceased Mrs. Zhang. So, isn't Mr. Zhang full of revolutionary spirit? However, we feel that Ms. Wu, having been a widow for more than twenty years, is able to jump out of the trap of ritualism, which seems to be especially full of revolutionary spirit.</p>
<p>Indeed, in today's world, there is no question of whether a widow is allowed to marry or not. In other words, there is only the question of whether she is willing to marry or not, and whether she is suitable to marry or not. We can say that, apart from our noble country, it seems that there is no such thing as a chastity system in other countries around the world. For thousands of years, we Chinese have referred to loyalty and chastity together. Emperor Qin Shihuang specially built the Nvhuaiqing Terrace to reward women for upholding chastity. During the Sui Dynasty, there were edicts stating that officials of the ninth rank and above whose husbands had died were not allowed to remarry, and concubines of the fifth rank and above whose husbands had died were not allowed to remarry. Since the Tang Dynasty, the restraints of ritualism have become even more severe. Although there were a few who were able to break through ritualism and do what their hearts desired, such as Han Yu's daughter, who first married Li Han and later remarried to Fan Zongyi, and Xue Juju's wife, Chai, who later remarried to Zhang Qixian, such examples can still be found in history. However, the vast majority, or 99 percent, were always bound by ritualism and the poison of the chastity system, and spent their lives in lonely and empty beds, not daring to remarry.</p>
<p>In fact, there should seem to be no doubt that a widow's remarriage is an inherent right of the widow. Widows have free will, and others should not force her not to marry or force her to marry. Some, although their husbands have died, are willing to live as widows. Their will is not to remarry, or it may be due to environmental factors that they cannot marry. Then, those who force her to remarry are committing a crime under the law. According to what I have heard, there are still many places in mainland China where widows are forced to remarry through plundering methods. Local tyrants and evil gentry often profit from this. Such inhumane acts are probably more severe than forcing her to uphold chastity. She may have many children to rely on in the future, or she may have a rich inheritance to live a carefree life, and local tyrants and evil gentry often force her to remarry, and uncles and aunts who do not understand reason and do not know the law often covet the bride price and do not hesitate to force her to remarry or secretly allow others to plunder her away. This is truly outrageous.</p>
<p>Again, some places are also feeling pain in the same way. From a human perspective, young women in the prime of their beauty have unfortunately lost their husbands and must live alone in empty rooms. Isn't this forcing people to do what is difficult, and isn't it exploiting and destroying the rights of women (widows)? In our Chinese society, many families still have a concept of "family reputation," believing that even if their son has died, they must shackle the daughter-in-law, otherwise, letting the daughter-in-law remarry would be considered indecent and shameful. Regardless of whether the daughter-in-law is unwilling to uphold chastity, she must be prepared to uphold chastity. In fact, upholding chastity is a matter of personal free will. How can she be forced to do so? Then, if she is a widow and she must marry or remarry, and if she is prevented or suppressed, it is the same crime as forcing her to remarry when she is unwilling to marry but is forced to remarry.</p>
<p>In short, widows have the free will of widows. Whether to remarry or not can be said to be entirely up to them to decide. In other words, this is their own business, and others do not seem to have the right to interfere with them.</p>
