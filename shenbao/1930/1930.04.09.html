<p>時評</p>
<h3>日紗廠之節約問題</h3>
<p>日本自鐘紡紗斷行减俸後。各紗廠均將實行節約。此其原因。雖有種種。而世界商業之不振。實爲之主體。蓋世界商業不振。則各國均就其力之所能及者。以自爲謀。於是工業國之求市塲於世界者。日見其難。貨多而難於售。或雖售其價。勢不得不節約其本廠之費用。以求出入之相抵。斯其將來。不特日本爲然。各國皆然。不特紗廠爲然。各種之工廠皆然。日本之紗廠。特其先見者耳。夫世間之事。往往互爲因果。歐戰之所以起。雖有種種政治原因。爲之導線。而</p>
<p>其實際。則由於經濟之爭。工業之國家。因工商業發逹而强盛。因强盛而仿效者多。遂至工商業發達者不止一國。工業國日多。而商塲有限。競爭旣烈。乃醖釀而至欲以一戰以破壞敵之工商業。以推廣已之工商業。豈知大戰之後。財力旣窮。各思藉工商業之力。以恢復其財力。於是工商業之競爭。愈益劇烈。而市塲銷售之力。愈益薄弱。乃至有今日。貨物過多。商業蕭索之現狀。此决非短時間所能補也。</p>

<h3>長江華輪轉機</h3>
<p>長江華輪、自去歲夏季至今、停行時多、開航日少、營業上之直接間接、損失當在二百萬元以上、迨至近日、始由各輪公司與交通處往返磋商、而停業各輪、乃得陸續放回、乃另派海輪一部往代替、揚子江中國航業、始有恢復之望此事關係我國長江航務絶續轉機、不得不詳加調查、分記如次</p>
<p>復業輪船日多　招商之三大江輪放回後、江案輪昨亦抵滬、江靖輪亦將回申、從本星期起一四三六各班、已可照常開行、唯快利·江大·江天·三船·一時尚難復航、然已有七輪可開、自去年四月至今、已可爲復航船最多之一時期、肇興公司之肇興·裕興·二輪·與寧紹公司甬興·寧紹·等輪、兹亦完全開班、三北公司先開新寧興·鳴鹤·二輪·長興修竣、亦可就航、每一星期中、已有華江輪六輪至七船行駛、</p>
<p>峨嵋行駛川河　此次上游發生外輪罷業風潮、爲中國船競爭營業之最好機會、三北公司、已將長沙班鴻元·鴻亨·二船、改行宜漢、而招商局之峨嵋輪在滬修理者、據江南廠報告已竣工、即日先行試車、准定下星期、先往漢口、行駛宜昌班、如英日輪之領江二潮不决、便令該輪通行川河、以維航權、</p>
<p>訂定運蛋合同　長江之鷄蛋出口、數額極巨、每年轉裝到歐美日各國者、價値在千萬元以上、向來大部分由太古日淸怡和等輪承裝、僅大通安慶兩埠、每年之運蛋水脚、有十三萬兩之譜、今年華航商、擬收回該貨之運輸權、遂由招商局之營業科長李雲良、親往大通等埠、與蛋商磋商結果、以後之長江蛋裝申、准由招商、三北、兩局輪專運、每件水脚爲九角一分、聞已訂定合同矣、</p>
<p>攬運洋商貨品　長江英日各輪、咸有格本國洋貨轉口、故營業上常較華輪爲優、現在招商三北等、因江輪不久將全部復業、此後若全恃本街貨、則營業有限、非轉運洋貨不能發展、故今次招商局之李雲良赴長江各埠、即爲與漢宜各洋商、接洽洋貨到滬之轉口營業、刻下正在漢口進行中、今後揚子江内之中外商輪、將起激烈之競爭矣、</p>
<p>變更保險辦法　長江華輪、尚有軍用情事、本埠保險公會、特議定新辦法兩條、通知各輪局、（一）船舶由政府征調或租用、關於軍運時、如投保者、來信通知、除特别加費外、應知照其原來保單作爲停止效力、如征調或租用在十日以上者、得按日退還保費、如不報、即作自已放棄（一）從議决日起實行、</p>

<h3>閔行軍警團聯防辦事處成立</h3>

<h3>米價逐漸回小</h3>
<p>閘北暫停交易絶非事實</p>
<p>南北市米船共四萬餘石</p>
<p>戊辰社云、近兩日内米糧到貨暢旺、市價逐漸回小、一部分米船尚希冀高價以圖厚利而米行米店、見市氣緩和、來源踴躍、亦多觀望不進、加以廢歷淸明節及連日陰雨之故、因致交易呆滯、市面成擯持之狀、昨日外傳閘北米業因社會局限價之故暫停交易、絶非事實、不過少數米商希圖厚利擯持不售、以致做開不多而已、南市蘇同白粳續跌一角、洋米則漲上一角、松江薄稻前日售開之貨、尚未斛售、因買氣衰疲之故、浦面存積米船又達八十餘號、約計一萬餘石、北市有船三百餘號、計米三萬數千石、如銷胃一暢、則足資應付也、</p>

<h3>華絲出口新消息</h3>
<p>運歐水脚飛漲　自金貴潮起、各項水脚均漲、運往歐洲貨件、因用先令、亦已暗增、惟湖絲一項、裝至英法各國、因向來用銀兩爲水脚、比較他貨運費、似屬略遜、本埠英法各郵船公司、特會商改訂新水脚、將運歐絲價特别加大、每件（一百十二磅重）漲起、達一兩六錢起、至二兩五錢止、爲向所未有之事、水脚之巨、眞打破歷來運率新紀錄、自上海至法國馬賽·英國倫敦·意國日内瓦·納布爾·及蘇彝士·白絲每件、自十七兩八錢漲至十九兩四錢半、黃絲每件、自十三兩八錢漲至二十兩五分、運往里昂、白絲每件自二十兩七錢漲至二十二兩六錢、黃絲每件、自十六兩七錢漲至十八兩二錢半、裝至巴黎、白絲每件自二十七兩一錢半、漲至二十九兩六錢半、至莫斯科、白絲每件、自二十七兩六錢漲至三十兩一錢半、黃絲每件自二十三兩六錢、漲至二十五兩七錢半、其餘各埠亦皆照原額加漲十分之二有奇、已通知各客家矣、</p>

<p>現在財政當局還没有把省稅及市縣地方稅完全劃分淸楚、故省與縣市分担義敎經費的辦法、不容易有精密的估計、假定第二年中央與省各半、從第三年起、義務敎育經費由中央担任百分之四十五、省担任百分之十、地方担任百分之四十五、並應竭力鼓勵私人興學、以减輕公家的担負、</p>
<p>附註</p>
<p>（註一）　所謂「交通在學期間」譬如放麥假、辦半日學校等、</p>
<p>（註二）　現在國庫空虛、師資缺乏、鄉間農民又須兒童帮助工作、若要使全國學齡兒童一律入學四年、毫無間斷、事實上恐難辦到、故擬定一種變通辦法、凡應受義務敎育的兒童、得按照他們家庭狀况、捒擇下列五種入學方式之一、甲、入正式小學四年、</p>
<p>乙、入正式小學三年、以後改入補習學校、每晚修學二小時、俟修滿二年、就可以算初小畢業、丙、入正式小學二年、以後轉入補習學校、每晚修學二小時、修滿四年、也可以算初小畢業、</p>
<p>丁、入正式小學一年、以後入補習學校、每晚修學二小時、修滿六年、也可以算初小畢業、</p>
<p>戊、凡入正式小學、一年以内不能毫無間斷的、可以每年入學半年、兩年之後、再入補習學校、補成初小敎育、</p>
<p>總之正式小學一年、等於補習敎育二年、正式小學半年、等於補習敎育一年、凡不能繼續入正式小學的得入補習學校、補足他們應受的敎育、但學齡兒童至少須入正式小學一年、或繼續在校、或分爲兩個半年入學、均無不可、</p>
<p>（註三）　這種補習學校、專爲不能入正式小學的兒童而設、所授課程的内容和初級小學相同、惟將一年的功課、分作兩年敎授、除每晚上課兩小時外、須指定功課呌學生在家裏自修、補足敎</p>
<p>室作業的不足、</p>
<p>（註四）　所謂自修制度一就是把應學的課程、呌兒童在家裏自修、由學校定期考試、如能及格可以免除兒童入學義務的一部份、</p>
<p>（註五）　現在全國共有一九一五縣、若每縣設立城市及鄉村義務育實騐區各一處、全國就應有上述兩項實騐區各一千九百十五處、但貧瘠縣分、得聯絡二縣以上合設實騐區一二所、故本計畫中僅規定在五年裏全國設立城市及鄉村義務敎育實騐區各約一千五百盧、</p>
<p>（註文）　前大學院曾在民國十七年製就調查表格通令各省市敎育行政機關、詳案學齡兒童人數、原限到十七年年底呈報、不過那時北伐初告成功、軍事結束未久、各省對於學齡兒童的調查有好多遷延不辦的、截到十八年九月爲止、只有南京特别市一處已經把學齡兒童確數報部、其餘各省市都没有確實報告、故全國學齡兒童人數、只能根據全國人口約數估計、在歐美各國大約每六人中有一學齡兒童、但中國兒童的「學齡年期」暫定從六歲到十二歲、期間比歐美短、並且義務敎育又暫定以「使全國學齡兒童得受初小四年的敎育」爲目標、故人數更可减少、現在暫假定每十人中有應受義務敎育的學齡兒童一人、</p>
<p>各省市調查户口没有完成、全國人口究有多少、也没有詳確的報告、據民國四年前北京國務院統計局估計、全國人口是三七七、六七三、四二四人、民國十四年郵務管理局估計、全國人口是四三六、○九四、九五三人、民國十七年海關估計、全國人口是四四八、二三一、○○○人、再參考各種地誌、覺得上檺郵務管理局估計的數目較爲近似、</p>
<p>若照四萬三千六百餘萬人口推算、全國學齡兒童共有四千三百六十萬餘人、除去已經人學者以外、還有三千七百十九萬餘人、没有受初等敎育的機會、若要實施義務敎育、就須使這三千七百餘萬學齡兒童入學、</p>
<p>（註七）　照民國十三年以前統計、全國學齡兒童已入學者有六百四十餘萬人、現在入學人數或已增加、還没有詳確的統計可憑、故仍照這數扣算、</p>
<p>（註八）　兹據調查所得、把民國十三年以前各省小學敎員每人所敎學生人數列表如下、</p>
<p>全國小學敎員平均每名所敎學生表一覽表</p>

<p>根據上表、初小敎員每人平均可敎學生二十六名左右、今就敎員管敎能力限度計算、每一人平均敎初小學生四十名、那末使四千餘萬兒童人學、必須增加敎員一百萬餘人、假定二十年裏有敎員四十萬人退職、那末要造就師資一百四十萬人才够、據中華敎育改進社民國十四年統計、全國共有師範學校一百九十五年、每年畢業生總計不滿一萬人又師範講習所及專修科一百○六所、總計每年畢業生、至多亦不過五千人左右、要在二十年裏養成一百四十餘萬小學敎師、要别開門徑才可、</p>

<p>照上所列每一敎室僅容學生三十六七人、在實施義務敎育時、每一敎室容約的學生數、應須儘量增加、假定每一敎室平均容納學生四十人、那末三千七百十九萬兒童完全人學時、至少要增加敎室一百萬間、</p>

<p>總平均　五·○二　一九·四八　三一·二五　一八·五八</p>
<p>根據上表、初小學生每名每年須由公家擔任經費五元餘、高小學生每名第年十九元餘、初等職業學校每名每年三十一元餘、今暫定義務敎育四年、經費只須照初小計算、在民國十三年以前、初小學生每人每年只須由公家擔任經費五元、但各省市自從歸國民政府統治以後、小學敎員的待遇大多數已經提高、小學的設備也比從前改善、故公費需要額應當增加、照現在的實况、初小學生每人每年至少須由公家擔任經費七元、若使四千萬兒童一律得入初等小學、那末、每年公家要增加義務敎育經費二億八千萬元才够、</p>
<p>（註十一）現在財政困難、新添的敎室、恐難特别建案、只好借用民房、加以修理、使室中光線空氣適合、大約每增一新班、約須開辦費五百元、（房屋修理費校具購置費及其他行政費用一併包括在内、）倘培養敎師一人、公家須擔負經費二百元、那末養成敎師一百萬人、須欵二萬萬元、實際上、恐還不够、</p>
<h3>第二章　實施成年補習敎育初步計畫</h3>
<p>（一）目標</p>
<p>本計畫的目標、在使全國靑年及成年失學的民衆、得受一種補習性質的短期學校敎育、這種補習敎育、狠爲重要、但在我國學制系統上没有占一定的地位、爲便利起見、簡稱爲成年補習敎育、成年補習敎育、本兼含國民識字訓練及職業訓練兩種、本計畫係初步計畫、擬在訓政的六年裏儘先完成國民識字訓練的重大工作、至於職業訓練、可以麥照第五章改進中等敎育計畫及第七章改進社會敎育計畫裏關於職業敎育部份、</p>
<p>（二）原則</p>
<p>甲、國民識字訓練、應用最少金錢最短時間、使一般民衆有識字讀書及運用四權的能力、</p>
<p>乙、國民識字訓練、先從集團人民辦起、逐漸推廣到散居人民、先從富庶地方辦起、逐漸推廣到貧瘠地方、除天災及有特殊情形的區域外、不得延緩、</p>
<p>丙、受國民識字訓練者之年齡、應從滿十二歲起到五十歲止、</p>
<p>丁、國民識字訓練、不但不識字者、須負學習的義務、已識字者、也須負敎人的義務、</p>
<p>戊、國民識字訓練的施行、應有很嚴密的考核、</p>
<p>己、國民識字訓練、旣立基礎以後、應有繼續長進的機會、</p>
<p>（三）目前急切問題</p>
<p>甲、應怎樣使全國失學民衆入學、全國不識字的民衆約占全人口百分之八十、（註一）全國人口、假定估計爲四三六、○九四、九五三人、那麽根據種種關係、加以特殊原因（註二）可以把旣識字、不識字、與應受補習敎育者的敎目分析如下、表</p>
<p>子、旣識字者約百分之二十、共計、八七、二一八、九九○人、</p>
<p>丑、　不識字者約百分之八十、共計、三四八、八七五、九六二人、</p>
<p>一、五十歲以上者約百分之十三、三三、共計、五八、一三一、四五七人、</p>
<p>二、學齡兒童約百分之十、共計、四三、六○九、四九五人、</p>
<p>三、六歲以下的孩童約百分之十、共計、四三、六○九、四九五人、</p>
<p>四、盲聾啞等殘廢及有精神病、或神經病者約百分之、二五、共計、一、○九○、二三七人、</p>
<p>五、應受補習敎育者約百分之四六、四二、共計、二○二、四三五、二七七人、</p>
<p>根據此表、將識字與不識字的民衆分析如下圖、觀上表及圖、曉得應受成年補習敎育的人數、是二億零二百餘萬人、幾占我國民衆全數的一半、這是我們成年補習敎育對象的總數、應該怎樣使這種不識字的民衆、能識字能讀書能看報、能算數、那便是首先應該籌議的、</p>
<p>乙、所需師資應怎樣養成、辦理成年補習敎育、應該與實施義務敎育、同時並進、才有種種利用的機會、就是師資能借助的也不少、不過在義務敎育没有完全普及以前、每年有不少失學的學齡兒童、因年齡增長而暗中加入靑年失學的數量以内、所以在推行義務敎育的進行中、即使凡是小學都兼作成年補習敎育的機關、凡是小學敎員、都兼作成年補習的敎員、也至多只能抵銷每年增加的數量、這二億零二百四十多萬的失學者、要另找師資、才能有解决辦法、假定二億零二百四十多萬失學者、分作六年完成國民識字訓練、平均每年須訓練三千三百七十四萬人、每人受訓練四個月、一年内可分三期訓練、每次平均約一千一百二十四萬人、每一敎員、輪敎二班、每班平均以五十人計、即每一敎員、平均敎一百人、約需敎員十一萬二千四百七十人、六年之内、敎昌須更換百分之十二、（按照第一章義務敎育計畫中估計、每年更換百分这之二、）共需敎員約十三萬五千人、這些鉅額敎師、應該怎樣選擇、和怎樣培檳呢、（未完）</p>

<h3>棒球錦標</h3>
<p>今日津港必爭</p>
<p>以前比賽槪况</p>
<p>我國於棒球一項素乏提倡故參加大會比賽者其數較其他球項爲寡、報名者湖南·上海·天津·湖北·江西·北平·香港·等七隊、賽際上僅有湖南·上海·天津·香港四隊開始第一幕、上海即以十一比○勝湖南、接後上海與天津相戰、上海初占勝利、以一比○占先、於前六局、乃功虧一簣、被天津於絶望之中、超越於前、卒以四比一獲决賽權、是役也、天津之勝、由於擊球之有力、個個如生龍活虎靈巧非凡、加以上海連有二次極大錯誤、遂收最後之成功、香港好手極多、錦標呼聲中、最有希望、蓋港地人才、較爲優秀其獲勝也、當在意料之中、最後錦標之誰局、當視今日津港二隊選手之努力如何耳、</p>
<p>游泳賽入水時情形王開攝</p>
<h3>游泳錦標</h3>
<p>冠軍香港隊能坐得</p>
<p>亞軍遼粤滬必相爭</p>
<p>游泳比賽第一日預賽結果遼寗隊一鳴驚人、史興隆以極佳成續得一英里自由式、第一名香港得第二第四列次席、廣東第三、上海隊竟致落選、惟遼寗隊人數過少、冠軍希望極徴、香港隊人才濟濟觀預、結果分數可穏得第一、所剩未預賽、抵二百二十碼蛙式及百六十碼替換游泳、百六十碼以香港隊之人才平均、冠軍毫無問題、是故游泳錦標、坐落香港之手矣、至於亞軍、</p>
<h3>史興隆游泳姿勢林澤人攝</h3>
<p>以成績論遼寗隊呼聲最高、史興隆百碼四百四十碼之第一、十居八九、百碼仰泳廣東可居冠軍、上海俞斌祺雖得第三組第一、惟成績相差頗遠、恐無希望、位置則可必得也、其餘三項、得分較難也、是以亞軍雖遼粤滬三隊行將角逐、尚以遼粤較有希望也、試測各隊得分、以較决賽結果、</p>
<h3>預測各隊分數</h3>
<p>項目　五十碼　百碼　四百四十碼　百碼　英里决賽</p>
<p>自由式　自由式　自由式　仰泳（已確定）</p>
<p>香港　六分　四分　五分　一分　四分</p>
<p>遼寗　三分　五分　六分　○分　五分</p>
<p>廣東　○分　二分　○分　七分　二分</p>
<p>上海　一分　一分　○分　三分　○分</p>
<p>總計</p>
<p>香港　二十分　遼寗　十九分　廣東　十一分</p>
<p>上海　五分</p>
<p>惟尚有二百二十碼蛙式及一百六十碼替換游泳、於此預測位置可將不發生問題、個人總分、香港陳其松陳振興遼寗史興隆、將一競爭矣、</p>
<h3>男子排球槪述</h3>
<p>華南練習多機會</p>
<p>複賽粤港有把握</p>
<p>此次參加大會排球錦標比賽者男隊計有閩·</p>
<p>津·浙·粤·贛·蘇·鄂·港·遼·滬·湘·豫·平·寗·十四單位、女則有粤·蘇·滬甲·遼·皖·平甲·浙·贛·津·湘·平乙·滬乙·鄞·閩·十四隊除河南男隊及福建女隊、因故未到外、實際臨陣競賽者、男女各有十三隊之多、運動員綜計約四百餘人、南北優秀、會聚一堂、切磋觀摩、藉比賽以求進步、在吾國體育史上、堪稱破天荒之盛舉、且每當比賽之際、觀衆極爲擁擠、平均計之、約在二三千左右、躋躋蹌蹌盛極一時在吾國體育幼稚時期、以國人素不經心之排球、而有如斯之盛况洵屬良好氣象、記者逐日躬臨陣地、對於各隊實力之比較、及一週來競爭之情况、知之較稔、爰作簡單槪述、以供留心此道者之參考、</p>
<p>按吾國之有排球、實以華南爲發源地、蓋閩粤諸省、氣候較暖、對於此項運動、極屬相宜因習之者愈衆、興趣愈濃、技術之進步亦愈速、其中人才輩出、更僕難數、吾國參加曆屆遠東之代表、悉遴選於其間屢奪冠軍、爲國爭光、厥功至偉、故就曆史上之實力而論、此次與賽之各隊、自當以香港廣東福建三省爲最優、但滬隊亦爲全埠精萃所組成、在華東方面可算首屈一指、健將如曹廷贊謝寳常李信標等多係一時名宿、惜於初賽中首遇强有力之香港、而遭失敗、否則大有亞軍之希望也、其次當以遼寗南京爲較優、二隊人才、尚稱平均、惟遼寗偏居東北、天氣寒冷、雨雪較多、平日練習機會旣少、又更乏强隊比賽、經騐當然較差、南京隊聞係爲中央軍官學校所代表、隊員類多閩粤人士、對於此道、頗具根底、無如成軍未久、聯絡方面、難稱盡善、觀其與北平之戰、其實力正復不弱、現已奪得次賽權也、即將與香港作複賽之爭競、若江蘇天津兩隊、能手亦甚多、但就全局而而論、似不如遼寗南京之平衡、因次賽即遇廣東、殊難露其頭角、餘子如浙·鄂·贛·湘·平·諸隊、類多缺乏長久之練習、及戰陣之經騐、佈局散漫、防禦疏忽、聯絡呼應、均感不靈、宜其於初賽中即遭淘汰也、</p>
<p>現時排球已入複賽時期、福建對廣東、香港對南京、均將於日内一見高下、以記者眼光之觀察、廣東與香港、取勝之把握較多、至以各隊中個人之本領而論、香港隊中之陳錫炳、可稱爲特殊之人才、其壓擊工夫、已臻化境、凡球入其手中、未有能遭倖免者、譽之者謂爲東亞之第一名手、確非過譽也、</p>
<h3>女排球槪評</h3>
<p>各隊實力雖參差不齊</p>
<p>精神飽滿則始終如一</p>
<p>錦標粤隊較有希望</p>
<p>排球遊戲、傳入吾國較遲、除粤滬通商大埠以外、内地各省人士習之者極少、甚至規則亦不甚明瞭、若女子方面、更難言普及、而此次大會角逐其中者、竟有十三隊之多、殊出一般人士預料之外、雖各隊實力、參差不齊、而精神則始終如一、强者不以勝而驕矜、弱者不以失敗而氣餒、能深得運動之眞諦、殊屬難能可貴也、</p>
<p>華南排球隊所以强盛之原因、已如前段所述、而女子亦何獨不然、就七日間比賽過程之觀察、及每日登載成績之比較、此次冠軍當以廣東呼聲最高、滬甲亦有相當之希望、然與粤勝相抗、取勝較難、惟有視當時之倖運而已、平甲之實力、亦頗雄厚、雖敗於滬甲之手、然其表演成續之優良、頗爲觀衆所贊許、固未可以勝敗論人也、滬乙爲後起之秀、姿勢極爲活潑、如能多得比賽、以求經騐上之增進、將來造就、殊有無限之希望、餘者多係僻處内地、見聞較淺、敎學方法稍差、因此一臨戰陣、舉措慌亂、進退無方、偶遇强敵、應付維艱、蓋因所處之環境不同、不可以人才之消長爲標準、現廣東與滬甲二隊、旣得决賽、則九日决賽之競爭、爲錦標關鍵之所繫、二隊必出其全力以相搏、屆時之表演、定能享觀衆之期望也、</p>
<h3>男籃球錦標</h3>
<p>已入肉搏時期</p>
<p>津隊勝北平極易</p>
<p>滬隊與香港角逐</p>
<p>男子籃球錦標賽、自前日上海隊以五十三比四十四戰勝遼寗、及香港隊以五十七對四十三克服神户後、香港與上海互獲複賽權、本定昨日一决雌雄以兩後場地不適作戰、延至今日再戰、預料當有一番極激烈之爭奪、其另外一隊獲複賽權者爲天津與北平、將來再由獲勝之兩隊决賽、奪取錦標、故今明兩日男籃球錦標賽、已運肉搏時期兹將過去成績、及現存各隊實力概况、詳爲介紹、則錦標之誰屬、亦可十得其六七焉、</p>
<p>之江大學游泳池林澤人攝</p>
<h3>過去成績</h3>
<p>就過去成績而言、第一方面第一週中、天津首以百五十四對四勝江西、江蘇以四十對廿七勝廣東、北平勝湖南棄權、浙江勝安徽三十六對十五、第二週中天津以三十四比十三勝江蘇北平以七十五對二十四勝浙江故碩果僅存者爲天津北平兩隊、至第二方面第一週中、上海首勝山東棄權、遼寗勝福建八十九對十六、神户以九十一對四十六勝湖北、香港以四十三對二十勝南京第二週中上海勝遼寗香港勝神户、所存者爲香港上海二隊、</p>
<h3>四隊實力</h3>
<p>天津北平上海香港四隊、實力互有優長、天津以合作敏捷見勝、北平以體格得先、上海以投籃準確著名、香港以活潑矯健稱雄天津與北平曾先後握華北之牛耳、但北平隊自上屆華北運動會中、被挫之天津南開隊後、名將如全岩等均已離隊他去人才凋零、殊不克維持現狀、今日北平之代表、大都均爲新出名手、雖初生王犢不畏虎、但津隊五虎將經騐充足、復益之扶輪之姚恩漢、靑年會著名中鋒李淸安、内衛何步雲、故預測天津與北平之戰、天津之希望、似頗有把握也</p>
<h3>滬港戰</h3>
<p>其次言上海與香港之戰、香港隊雖活潑矯健、但滬隊人才濟濟、如何通陸踵恩等、均係個中名手、五人聯防功夫、亦有相當練習預料香港終將拱手相讓、但無論如何、當有一番劇戰、上海倘不努力、前途正難言料也、</p>
<p>昨日會塲雨景林澤人攝</p>
<h3>津滬决賽</h3>
<p>就一般的觀測此次獲得决賽權、以津滬兩隊成分爲多、兩隊决賽時、賽力半斤八兩、正不知鹿死誰手、但津隊合作功夫及戰略、觀夫歷次成續、似稍優於上海、此點滬隊應加以充分注意者也、</p>
<h3>女子籃球略述</h3>
<p>滬平廣東角逐錦標</p>
<p>希望各奮最後努力</p>
<p>女子籃球錦標賽、前日上海隊旣大勝江蘇隊、獲得决賽權後錦標之希望、亦加大一分、其另一方面、廣東與北平尚須一决雌雄、互爭决賽權、就過去成績而言、北平似較廣東稍優一籌、蓋廣東隊對女子籃球規則、殊不十分熟悉、到杭後重新練習、此層吃虧不少、至北平籃球隊、在華北方面久負盛名前鋒特别活潑、將來在奪標賽中倘與上海相遇定有一番空前激烈之戰、滬隊右鋒陳英瑞中鋒郭筱萍尤爲個中佼佼、擲籃之準確、恐上海隊當首屈一指、惟體格方面、滬隊似不如北平廣東、故錦標之誰屬、此時正難肯定、總之現最有希望者、爲上海北平廣東三隊、惟望各隊選手努力進取、奮門最力者、錦標之奪得蓋意中事也、</p>
<h3>男網球錦標</h3>
<p>攫奪總標一大關鍵</p>
<p>港滬必出死力以爭</p>
<p>球類錦標中、以網球錦標爲最難捉摸、因滬之林寳華·港之江道章何家鎏等、均未能參加、故除粤滬京港四隊實力較强外餘則均平平而已經初次二賽淘汰之後僅存滬粤京港四隊、相會於複賽之中、</p>
<p>前日下午該四隊作複賽於網球塲滬對粤、港對京、各賽單打兩組、滬鄭兆佳表演平平、遠不若在滬時之靈敏活潑、不幸而竟遭失敗、吳少香則日來表演均極有精彩前日之戰、尤爲出色其對手爲粤趙士倫、雖竭力抵禦、然終不敵、兩敗於吳手、結果滬粤各勝一組、香港對南京則全勝兩組、並不費力、尚有雙打各一組、及單打各二組、本定於昨日續賽、奈天時不佳、昨晨大雨傾盆、各塲地均泥濘非常、不堪應用、故改在今日繼續再賽、决賽權之誰屬、雖不能斷定惟香港之戰勝南京而取得决賽權、實較滬之勝粤爲有把握耳、</p>
<p>此次網球錦標之勝負、誠爲港滬二隊攫奪總錦標之一大關鍵、滬除已得全能錦標及足球可穏得外、餘無把握、港則可操勝算者、惟游泳與棒球二項、但排球亦極有希望、如上海隊不能奪得網球錦標、則總錦標亦必隨之而去矣、故今日之雙打、滬隊必出死力以爭也、</p>
<h3>女子網球誰得錦標滬津將力爭</h3>
<p>女子網球十四隊、轉輾征戰、强者存、弱者失、勝者在、敗者去、迄今存者尚有天津與廣東、北平與上海、已戰結果、天津全勝廣東單打二組、上海全勝北平單打兩組、今日雙打勝負即可定决賽權之誰屬、用察過過去之成績、以覘將來之勝負、</p>
<h3>天津較勝廣東</h3>
<p>天津初賽輪定、次賽雖僅勝江蘇、梁家姊妹、球藝高强、廣東雖一勝湖北、再勝南京、固不可輕視、惟二戰打結果、（一）天津梁佩瑶二比○勝廣東黃允儀、成績爲六比四、六比四、（二）天津梁佩瑜二比○勝廣東鄧志豪、成績六比二、六比四、今日雙打天津梁家姊妹對廣東黃鄧、天津之勝、十九在握、雖廣東尚有黃能球、恐終强挽狂瀾、是則天津可得第一組决賽權矣、</p>
<h3>北平不敵上海</h3>
<p>北平隊初勝湖南、再克遼寗、乘勝餘威、以遇上海、然上海隊之爪哇網球花李蓮、女網球能手蒯淑平校長、劈希抽壓、樣樣俱精、故一戰李蓮即勝北平杜連喆、再戰廖書筠敗於蒯淑平、今日雙打上海王大樂蘇祖琦雙打配拍手、將遇天津杜廖、上海之勝、可斷言也、即或受挫、二組單打對調、上海之勝易如反掌也、</p>
<h3>最後滬津奪標</h3>
<p>天津上海之戰、將定錦標之誰屬、兩隊勢均力敵、旗鼓相當、勝負難分、高下未可武斷、梁家姊妹、旣非弱者、李蓮蒯淑平、亦爲能手、或云上海較有把握、記者則未敢下一語也、</p>
<h3>足球雜話</h3>
<p>錦標預測</p>
<p>此次足球比賽、參加者共十二隊、因北平及河南兩隊未來、祗剩十隊、論實力當推上海爲最强、錦標可操左券、次爲廣東隊、再次爲添津遼寗兩隊、不料該兩隊在次賽複賽、相繼失敗、於是南京隊一躍而坐第二把椅、香港隊比次未曾報名參加、實爲最不幸事、否則對峙於决賽之局、必更能轟動觀衆、爲大會考色不少也、</p>
<p>昨日女宿舍前一片汪洋林澤人攝</p>
<h3>球藝略評</h3>
<p>歷次比賽、在我個人心目中認爲最稱心滿意者、首推上海隊之傳遞、及廣東隊之奔跑、天津遼寗之勇猛、湖南隊之古怪、亦足爲會場生色、個人球藝、如陳光耀君之盤球、聲東擊西靜如處女、動如脫兎、戴麟經之鈞球頭頂轉身、陳虞添之截球、轉灣、身輕若燕、可謂已登堂入室、周賢言之高托臥撲、已臻化境、誠足球人才中之不可多得之人才也、其他如李寗之搶球及陳君佩之接撲、球戰記中已載、不必細述、</p>
<h3>啦啦之聲</h3>
<p>在南京與遼寗之役中、在比賽之前、南京隊長姜靜南聲明歡迎打氣、女選手即應聲Ｒah!　Ｒah　Ｒah!Nonking大拉而特拉、與遼寗隊所呼之好啊、老劉再來一個、聲聲相應、一邊聲柔而嬌、一邊聲高而剛、誠比賽中之佳話也、</p>

<h3>大會之意義</h3>
<p>大會籌備副主任　周象賢著</p>
<p>溯自歐化東漸、我國競言運動、非一日矣、然由政府提倡各省健兒、爭先恐後、薈集一區、磨鍊之不已、比賽之比賽之不已、競爭之、如今日之全國運動大會、實我中華破天　之盛舉也、會中預儲各種奬品、莊嚴燦爛、羅列滿目、其雄健之尤者錦標奪得、奏凱而回、何等威嚴、何等榮耀、在運動諸君、人人有此心理、即在參觀運動諸君、亦人人有此觀念、雖然、此僅就表而言之耳、</p>
<p>粤游泳選手椿元華　　　攝</p>
<p>今日之運動、乃以奮鬥之精神、有國民之體育、有互相勸勉激勵之心、而無彼此嫉妒摧殘之意、勝固可喜、不勝亦不足爲辱、就不勝者之一方面而言、安知此番之挫折、非即敎導成全其他日之優勝乎、越王句踐之棲於會稽、拿破侖之困於孤島、哥侖布士之遭舟人睊怒、而卒覓得亞美利加洲皆由敗而勝者也、况裁判員一秉至公、以義務之資格、出而評判、無絲毫偏私自利之見、即使駒隙毫釐、不免參差、皆屬同胞、斷不至以得失之計較、而反受外來之非笑也、管見如此、不敢緘默、深望諸君、注意運動之形迹、注意運動之精神、尤須注意運動之道德、</p>
<h3>蔣敎長蒞會</h3>
<p>今日可到杭</p>
<p>敎育部蔣部長、定於今日（九日）到會、參加閉幕典禮、並致訓詞、現國府要人留杭者、均將俟大會結束後返京、</p>
<h3>會塲花絮</h3>
<p>浪花四濺　前日舉行游泳時、四座觀者幾無隙地、池小人多人游水動、於是浪花四濺靠近者雖看得眞切、但水花却濺得花多、</p>
<p>積水成潦　昨以激雨停賽各塲均蓄水深者可没踁尤以田徑賽塲放眼望去、一片汪洋工役忙於疏通或擔泥塡窪、司令台上亦潮濕不堪、以較前幾日之盛况相去遠矣、能容三百席二千餘人同時用膳之空前大飯廳原係蘆蓆所蓋成、不勝風雨之侵摧、昨晨大雨滂沱、地身又窪以致頃刻間變成澤國、施由各工役趕挖小漕引水他洩、始告無患、運動員有稱頌其功、謂不减於大禺之治水云、</p>
<p>聊解技癢　因展期一日比賽、運動員有冒雨登山、尋幽探勝、有盪舟湖中、以領略晴湖不如雨湖之風味、但游興較淡者、又以技癢難熬、則作方城之戰、以消磨其光陰、飯廳中凡泥地較高之桌上、均圓滿男女健兒、麻雀也、撲克也、游戲消遣、毫無金錢色彩、歡娛不減球頻之比賽、</p>
<p>各憑良心　女子二百米替換賽跑、東特與廣東發生衝突、致引起糾紛多起、旋經調停、約定重賽、結果廣東隊不到、大會辦事人無法應付、東特代表在司令台上大發言論、大談其憑良心不已、</p>
<p>苦中作樂　各報記者在大會中採訪新聞、無不鞠躬盡瘁、有人計算記者每日奔波步數之長不下二萬米之賽跑、杭州電廠業務課長陳壽蔭君深諒記者之苦衷、昨日特分發請柬云「執事負指導社會及主持輿論之責、此次爲體育事業而奔走、風塵僕僕、爲國宣勞、敝廠謹訂於本月八日下午七時、在敝院（按指杭州電廠之電影院）便酌候敎、並請參觀電影、以慰客中寂寞、藉度此千金一刻之春宵、湖山在望、恭候玉趾、」云云、情詞俱美、甜密有味、各記者苦中作樂、當感激不置也、</p>
<p>車夫北化　日來在會塲門首、雇車他往、索價十分昂貴、車夫分江北紹興兩帮、平時滿口土話、到了這幾天、居然也會北化、大打其藍靑官話、討論車價、不說幾角幾角、都改口說幾毛幾毛了、昨晨大雨後、至午後羞陽漸露、一般市民、早知最後數日之比賽、類多錦標决賽、故來會參觀者、滿城爲空、迨至會場、審知延期乃相率乘原車而返、化了大洋數元、博得兜風一䠀、眞足寃哉枉也、</p>
<p>急煞職員　昨午杭垣轉晴、雲撥日開、仍可繼續比賽、無如以早間有了緊急通告、說是「天雨不息、塲地勢難應用、所有比賽一律展後一天、」此際天雨旣息、最好以不牽動大會時間爲上、但欲下令照常舉行、則以値賽健兒、多放浪湖山、不易召集、辦事人急煞無用徒然給花花絮絮做材料、花花絮絮却是遊戲文字、有時也規規矩矩的說幾句、請寄語辦事人、以後要留心、倘使昨晨的布告活動一點、如說「上下之比賽、因天雨勢難按時舉行、下午之比賽、屆時視天色再行布告、」那末、就用不着急了、</p>
<h3>上海敎育團體籌備招待選手</h3>
<p>十三日下午一時招待</p>
<p>上海特别市敎育局寰球中國學生會等發起定期聯合上海各大學開會招待全國運動會各區過滬選手、於昨日下午三時開籌備會議、各大學代表出席者、有同濟大學羅淸濱、曁南大學傅循仁大夏大學邵家麟大同大學胡憲生、上海法政學院蔣恒琳潘潤夫、持志大學倪則舜、寰球中國學生會朱少屏等、願意加入而未出席籌備會者、尚有國立勞動大學中法大學藥學科復旦大學等、由朱君主席議决事件如下、（一）日期假定四月十三日下午一時、（二）地點定妥後再行宣佈、（三）會塲職員每圑體推派四人、（男三人女一人）（四）經費及游藝節目贈送紀念品等亦已商定辦法、有復信允到會之選手及指導領隊人數錄如左、</p>

<h3>玲丁丁告老還鄉</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>凡是看電影的人。一定都認識那狗明星玲丁丁。Ｒin　Tin　Tin又聰明。又義俠。又勇敢。簡直爲人類所不及。他是法蘭西阿爾薩斯Ａlsace產。最初發見他的。是一位美國飛行事滕根大佐。ＣaptainDuucan歐洲大戰時。美國加入作戰。大佐奉命赴歐。效命前敵。有一天在德國戰濠中。見一頭小狗。愛他的伶俐。即忙携回營寨。大戰停後。就帶同回國。竟一躍而爲銀幕上的明星。在華納兄弟影片公司Ｗarner　Brothers主演名片很多。儼然與約翰擺利馬亞·亞爾喬生·諸大明星做了同事。每年的包銀約有二萬五千金鎊。合墨銀約三十萬元之多。以狗而得此。也大足自豪了。玲丁丁今年十二歲。在狗的年齡也算不得如何老邁。可是據最近好蘭塢傳出消息。他已告老退休了。並不是爲的身體衰弱。也並不是受那有聲影戲的影響。只爲有一次攝片時。他不知怎的。竟不能再受主人的指揮。任是主人如何的向他打信號。他老是不動。可知他幾年來辛勞過度。在勢不能不退出電影界。作長時期的休息了。好在他銀行中存欵很多。儘可錦衣玉食。優游卒歲。不久他也許要回故鄉去走一遭哩。</p>
<h3>記俠盜療疾事</h3>

<p>盜世人之所惡也。孰知竟有踰乎恒情常軌如兹篇所述者。閱者殆將訝爲瀛海異乘乎。篇中事實。别饒奇趣。盜亦有道。於斯徴信。</p>
<p>皖北某君。執業某礦。督率工人。維勤維謹。一日。躑躅廠内。誤躓於石。流血過度。臥床不起。乞假養息。經久未愈。會鄉里間偶患匪警。某廠亦罹不幸。聲勢洶洶。恣意搶奪。比及寢舍。某聞聲遽起。止之曰。若曹勿爾。余一窮漢耳。病軀以外。别無長物。敢將私儲百數十番以獻。聊爲諸公壽。盍取去。幸勿驚我。顧余此後之醫藥費將虞無着。奈何。盜首思索有頃。慨然擲還銀洋若干。詢以究患何症。某指傷處示之。且告以故。盜曰。是不難。當有良藥饋汝。語畢。怱遽而去。翌晨。綠衣人至。折緘得藥一包。載明療法綦詳。試敷之。果愈。某嘗舉以語人曰。塞翁失馬。安知非福。窮鄉僻壤。得此良藥。洵不幸中之大幸也。</p>

<h3>雌鷄化雄考</h3>
<p>— 繡君</p>
<p>讀費公直君之雌鷄化雄文。就科學立論。不作讖緯家言。最長人識見。中據漢魏晋雌鷄化雄事以實之。歷歷如數家珍。尤徴淹博。雖未詳載原書。而一爲考訂所出。實皆根據史籍。無片語鑿空。蓋一物之微。亦見責實之道。與稽古之義焉。惟晉以後未之齒及。未免美猶有憾。不嫌蛇足。歷舉如下。</p>
<p>宋書五行志云。元嘉十二年。華林園雌鷄化爲雄。唐書武后本紀云。垂拱三年七月丁卯。冀州雌鷄化爲雄。永昌元年正月乙未。朗州雌鷄化爲雄。八月。松州雌鷄化爲雄。江南通志云。弘治二年。吳縣民家雌鷄化爲雄。二申野錄云。己卯（正德十四年）諸曁西隅酈煙家。母鷄化爲雄。尾長二三尺。如錦綬。冠羽俱異。雲南通志云。嘉靖三年。保山縣民曾銘家。雌鷄化爲雄。貴州通志云。嘉靖十五年。金州民間。有雌鷄化爲雄。江南通志云。嘉靖三十一年。嘉定縣雌鷄化爲雄。河南通志云。嘉靖三十九年。生員喬惟重家。雌鷄化爲雄。湖廣通志云。萬歷十九年。衡州府民家。雌鷄化爲雄。明史五行志云。萬歷二十二年六月。靖邊營軍家。雌雞化爲雄。崇禎九年。淮安民家。牝雞啼躍化爲雄。</p>

<h3>牡丹食譜</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>牡丹酥　玉蘭花片。吳中酒家常以之佐菜。淸芬鬆脆。味頗可口。牡丹花能作食品。則知者彌鮮。其法以淸鮮之牡丹花瓣。和興平酥以油煎。白糖蘸吃。味亦雋美。不遜於玉蘭花片也。</p>
<p>牡丹茶　茶所以解渴也。然每以茶葉之不佳而增渴。取牡丹花瓣泡茶。激甜而香。淸凉解渴。且色采鮮艶。尤堪淸賞。其花瓣須隔年採就。以糖醃之。貯錫罐中。經年始得。客有以餉我者。故知之。</p>
<h3>匪警所聞</h3>
<p>— 任培初</p>
<p>吾吳江地瀕太湖時被湖匪侵擾。往年匪勢單薄。尚無大患。自齊盧戰爭以後。京滬路積年搆兵。逃兵咸麕集太湖。於是匪勢益形猖獗。去年竟成整箇團體。自稱軍隊。向吳江各區勒索洗刦。民不安枕。一昨返里。親友僉以匪警相告。兹錄數則如下。</p>
<p>商借軍餉　蘆墟一小市鎭也。去年年底。被匪洗刦。並綁去小孩壯男甚多。家貧無力索贖者。都置諸死地。情殊可慘。上月三十日。盜匪又來光臨。居民一若驚弓之烏。急閉户不聲。豈知此次匪甚客氣。並不用强硬手段、到埠後。即向警察所商借三萬元以充軍餉。同時出某方委任令一件。自言正式軍隊。所借三萬元。日後得到某方軍餉後。當即歸還。磋商良久。卒以二千五百元了事。</p>
<p>林醫生大交好運　黎里鎭有西醫名林志淸者。初無藉藉名。上月初林某携五百元乘輪赴蘇辦藥。輪抵中途。適遇盜匪。全船洗刦。林亦不免。匪見其多金。叩其作何生理。林以業醫對。匪類喜。即將其推入匪舟。駛入匪窟。待之甚恭。請其治二匪病。不三日。匪病愈。於是欵待益殷。並以五十元爲林壽。放之歸里。越數日。匪又來黎。向警所詢林地址。警所因黎地業醫姓林者非一。乃叩其能知林醫生名否。答不知。斯時適另一醫生凌幹伯君。正在茶店啜茗。聞匪至。且欲找林醫生。因林凌諧音。誤林爲凌。認爲綁票。急步返家。中途顚仆。以致頭破血流。直至匪首誤述林某面貌狀態。始知爲林志淸。林以已有一次入匪窟之經騐。毫無懼色。隨匪入舟。診五匪。得診金百元。又越數日。匪病愈。匪首並來道謝。於是林名大噪。</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei and the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Wang's Attitude Seems Not Very Active</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo Urges Zou and Xie to Go to Taiyuan</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Wang Jingwei's attitude towards the recent situation seems not very active, so he has been slow to go north. According to a representative who recently met with Wang, Wang is dissatisfied with both Yan Xishan's Western Hills faction, saying that one side does not understand the party at all, and the other only wants to use the party's signboard as a tool to seek a livelihood, making cooperation difficult. However, Feng Huanzhang is still good, and so on. Wang has been publishing articles such as "On the Covenant Law" and "Knowing and Doing" in the South China Daily for several days, severely refuting Hu Shi and the National Socialist faction, who oppose the Kuomintang's theory. The newspaper is hosted by Lin Bosheng, Zhu Pu, Chen Kewen, Zeng Zhongming, etc., all of whom are core members of the Wang faction. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chen Gongbo and Wang Faqin telegraphed Tan Zhen on the 5th, saying that they had just received a telegram from Mr. Wang, saying that Zou and Xie had not compromised on the second session issue, fearing that this would cause more disputes. There will be many problems in the future, which is contrary to the spirit of unity. Commissioner Bai Gong is going to Peiping to welcome you all. Please come here to discuss everything. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Chen Gongbo, Wang Faqin, and others went to Taiyuan, they repeatedly discussed the issue of the party. For a time, it was difficult to resolve. After three negotiations with Yan Xishan, it was decided that Yan Xishan would preside over military affairs. After the military victory, the issue of the party would be moved. (8th Electrical Communication)</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Mission Expresses Calm</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Envoy Hoffman told reporters that rumors of a meeting of the diplomatic mission to discuss the current situation were not true. The diplomatic mission has not held a meeting recently, nor has it had an informal discussion on anything. As for Yan's notification, there was no word of expecting a reply. The countries have no so-called decision to express or not. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhu Hexiang decided to first take over the External Affairs Archives, using one or two of the original custodians, and the rest will be submitted to the General Headquarters for registration.

It is estimated that military operations this month are unlikely to be launched. (8th dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Issue of Economy in Japanese Textile Mills</h3>
<p>Since the Kanegafuchi Spinning Mill took the lead in cutting salaries, all textile mills in Japan will implement economy measures. There are various reasons for this, but the main reason is the slump in world commerce. When world commerce slumps, all countries will seek their own interests to the best of their ability. As a result, it is becoming increasingly difficult for industrial countries to seek markets in the world. Goods are plentiful but difficult to sell, or even if they are sold, it is necessary to economize on the expenses of the factory in order to offset the income and expenses. This will be the case not only for Japan in the future, but for all countries. This will be the case not only for textile mills, but for all kinds of factories. Japanese textile mills are just the first to see it. Affairs in the world often have mutual cause and effect. There were various political reasons that led to the outbreak of the European War, but in reality, it was due to economic competition. Industrial countries became strong due to the development of industry and commerce. Because of their strength, many imitated them, and eventually, the number of countries with developed industry and commerce was not limited to one. As the number of industrial countries increased, the commercial market became limited. As competition became fierce, it brewed up and led to a desire to destroy the industry and commerce of the enemy through war in order to expand one's own industry and commerce. How could they know that after the great war, their financial resources were exhausted, and each thought of relying on the power of industry and commerce to restore their financial resources. As a result, competition in industry and commerce became even more intense, and the strength of the market sales became even weaker, leading to the current situation of excessive goods and commercial depression. This can definitely not be remedied in a short period of time.</p>

Since I put down Zhang Chu and have been actively training, the officers and soldiers of the department have been able to understand the principles and believe that the important task of saving the country has no other way than revolution. Now that the country is unfortunate, and the reactionaries are using military force, the unity that was about to be achieved has entered a state of collapse again. How can I not be indignant when I think of this? But these remnants of feudal warlords have become a thing of the past in the world trend. However, it is a fleeting reflection and will soon destroy itself. However, the obstacles to the revolution must be eradicated completely. I dare to ask for a clear order to attack and lay the foundation for the country as soon as possible. Zhennian is not talented, but only knows how to obey.

<h3>Three-Nation Special Committee Reviews Japan's Shipbuilding Plan</h3>
<p>Italian Chief Delegate Likely to Return Home Soon</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 7th: The special committee of the United Kingdom, the United States and Japan met at St. James' Palace this afternoon to deliberate on the Light Cruiser and Destroyer construction year plan for after 1936 proposed by Japan. After reviewing for three hours, there was still some distance between the claims of both sides and the consent of the United Kingdom and the United States had not been obtained. However, the United Kingdom and the United States had in principle recognized the Japanese claims and a satisfactory solution would certainly be reached after one or two more meetings. The meeting had also discussed the issue of switching ship types, but since there was the enthusiastic claim by France as well as a special matter of having to await the fate of the five-nation meeting to be decided before a decision was good to be made, the United Kingdom and the United States were not in a hurry to reach a conclusion. At the same time, the United Kingdom and the United States had slight dissenting opinions, so that its decision must await the decision of the three-nation plenary meeting.</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 7th: The confirmed item was just exactly what form Japan would take for the reserved items in the three-nation agreement. There were also various opinions within Japan's delegation, which was in the midst of research. They all asserted that rather than using the words of a reserve, it would be better to have a general item, declaring that this treaty prescribed that after 1936, each signatory nation would not be bound by the amount it maintained, and adding a line to the treaty so as to cut straight to the point and make Japan's will known, which would be more appropriate. On the morning of the 4th, Director Sato took this item to visit U.S. Chief Delegate Richard. At noon, there was a meeting of Chief Delegates Matsudaira and Richard for about one and a half hours. The United States side generally agreed with the case. On this matter, the opinions between Japan and the United States can be said to be completely in agreement, that even after the expiry of the treaty, Japan can indicate the requirement of 70% for large-scale cruisers and 70% overall for auxiliary vessels according to this item. However, in order to make this purpose more clearly, Chief Delegate Wakatsuki has decided to make an appropriate announcement at the general meeting, according to the original plan.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th: The Italian Chief Delegate at the Naval Meeting, Grandi, is eager to return to Rome by the middle of next week. Today he met with the British Prime Minister, reiterating Italy's views and expressing his willingness to abide by the method of ceasing the construction of battleships. This expression by Italy will give France an advantage of 100,000 tons of battleships. However, Grandi declared that while Italy does not want to build ships to the standard of France, Italy still requires being the same as Italy in theory. The spokesperson for the Italian delegation claimed this evening that Italy did not want to hear about any agreements between the United Kingdom and France regarding the interpretation of the articles of the International League Charter. Grandi also met with the French Naval Minister, Dumaisnil, and made some remarks. It has been said that what the Foreign Minister issued can be called a frank conversation.</p>
<p>National Press, London, 7th: According to the U.S. delegate at the Naval Meeting, the three-nation agreement has already been determined. However, the British Cabinet members did not permit a reply to this question in the National Assembly today.</p>
<h3>Issues Regarding Interpretation of the League of Nations Covenant</h3>
<p>MacDonald Expresses Opinion</p>
<p>Lamb Retracts Motion</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th – Conservative Party member Lamb, after questioning Foreign Secretary Henderson in the House of Commons today, proposed a motion to suspend other business in the House to debate a pressing public matter: the British government's alleged agreement with another government regarding the interpretation of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, without consulting the League's Administrative Council or the House of Commons. Prime Minister MacDonald responded, stating that Lamb's question concerned Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant. If another interpretation involving new obligations were to arise, would the British government consult the League's Administrative Council and allow the House of Commons the opportunity to consider the matter before agreeing to the interpretation? He could not promise this. To do so, he knew, would be most strongly opposed by Chamberlain, as such a promise would mean that no government could exchange opinions or express its views on the meaning of Article 16. Lamb was well aware of the ambiguity of this article. Such a promise would make it impossible for Britain and France, or Britain and Germany, to exchange views on the meaning of the article without first consulting the League's Administrative Council. He could not make such a promise, nor had questioners done so when they were Under-Secretaries of State, or put it into practice. The current discussions among members of the Hague Conference regarding Article 16 were merely members asking each other what meaning they personally attached to it. This differed from the situation at Locarno, where Germany's request for clarification regarding its obligations upon joining the League of Nations involved a new interpretation of the Covenant that only the League's Administrative Council could provide. All the government could say was that it would continue discussions on the matter, having explored public and parliamentary opinion to the best of its ability, and would not forget public sentiment. This was what the government had striven to do during the difficult past two and a half months. If the leaders of other parties wished to consult with him when they felt they needed news from the Hague Conference, he would gladly discuss it with them, declaring whether or not it was appropriate to disclose the content of the conference's business. When the Prime Minister made this statement, Conservative Party leader Baldwin and Liberal Party leader George were not present. Former Conservative government Aviation Minister Hoare rose and spoke in favor of the Prime Minister's suggestion that the leaders of the three parties should meet to discuss matters when they needed to know news from the Hague Conference. Lamb then withdrew his motion.</p>

<h3>Japan Revises Army Regulations</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th – Japan's current army regulations were established during the Russo-Japanese War. Since then, tactics have evolved with the advancement of the times and the improvement of weapons, and there are many points that need to be revised. The Ministry of the Army began the revision during the era of Army Minister Shirakawa, but it was suspended due to opposition from the Military Council. Recently, a new draft amendment has been completed, passed by the Council, approved by the Cabinet, and will be implemented within days by imperial decree upon receiving the Emperor's approval.</p>
<h3>Issues of Savings at Japanese Textile Factories</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th – Due to Kanegafuchi Spinning Mill's (Kanebo) decisive implementation of salary cuts, Kanebo's stock plummeted. Other factories' stocks were also affected. Kanebo's salary cuts average 23.5% per person. According to this, the company's burden reduction is about one million yen per half-year. The reasons for the salary cuts are generally as follows: (1) It is impossible to predict how long the current recession following the lifting of the gold embargo will last. (2) It is difficult to maintain a dividend of 35%. To balance income and expenses, it is necessary to reduce expenditures. (3) The Donghua Spinning Mill, which expanded its business too much during the war, has stalled, and silk weaving has suffered considerable losses. (4) Raw materials have fallen due to the lifting of the gold embargo, and the increase in Indian tariffs has had a major impact. It is necessary to prepare to compete with Indian and British yarn. After this, other spinning mills, although not adopting the same active methods as Kanebo, will inevitably adopt the same passive policy, such as extending the promotion period for employees or reducing the promotion rate. Inwardly, each spinning mill does not oppose Kanebo's actions. Whether they will actively cut salaries is questionable, but the atmosphere of reducing dividends is quite strong. For example, Nisshin Spinning Mill, which has a business office in Osaka, has announced a reduction of 10% for employees and 5% for workers. However, the Ministry of Finance authorities believe that Kanebo's salary cuts are inappropriate in terms of timing and rate. Finance Minister Inoue even stated that Mr. Muto had vehemently opposed the salary cuts for government officials and is now contradicting himself. In addition, the proletarian factions have also risen to issue a joint front declaration on this matter.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Qingdao, 8th – The Qingdao Kanebo factory is in turmoil due to Kanebo's salary cut issue. The general employees are united and each is willing to contribute two weeks' salary, even at some sacrifice, and are determined to echo the mainland factories and start a large-scale opposition movement. In addition, the Qingdao Fifth Branch employees have also sent messages to various places, standing on a common front, and are planning to organize the entire textile labor union in China.</p>
<h3>Number of Unemployed in Japan</h3>
<p>Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 8th – According to the results of a Japanese government survey, it is known that there are as many as 350,000 unemployed people in Japan, and the trend is increasing.

As a result, it was decided that the Minister of Interior would issue a statement, broadcast on wireless telephone, hold film propaganda, and use various means to do everything possible to find jobs for the unemployed. At the same time, members of the national employment agencies will make personal visits to various parties to find jobs for the unemployed. It was also decided to make April 14th Unemployed Relief Day, on which the national employment agencies will launch a large-scale publicity campaign.</p>
<h3>Plan for Air Transport of Eels between China and Japan</h3>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 8th – The farming of eels in Lake Hamana, Shizuoka Prefecture, cannot meet demand due to the sharp increase in demand from cities such as Tokyo and Osaka.

Recently, it has been planned to experimentally transport them by air from Shanghai, with the dates set for the 29th and 30th of this month. As long-distance air transport between Shanghai and Lake Hamana is the first of its kind, the Ministry of Communications is also strongly supporting its success.</p>

He requested that the government be requested to approve his resignation as the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior for recuperation. The resolution was to forward it to the government for approval.</p>
<h3>Lu-Yellow River Reconstruction Stone Dam Plan</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Yellow River project in this province has always been based on straw materials, which are repaired and destroyed in rotation, and the losses are not worth the cost. Yesterday, the River Affairs Bureau drafted a plan to fully renovate the river with stone dams in order to achieve a one-time effort and reduce water escape. It has been passed by the Provincial Government's 76th meeting, ordering the Department of Finance to jointly raise funds with the River Engineering Committee. The plan is recorded as follows: "It is found that the materials used in the river engineering in this province are mainly straw materials, but the straw materials are of inferior quality and"</p>
<p>Light, floating in the water and easy to rot. When used to repair dams, they must be connected with ropes, layered with materials and soil, and combined into a huge volume to have the power to stabilize and resist water. Therefore, the splint dams are often used in urgent and dangerous places, and the price of the ropes and other materials used always exceeds the value of the straw materials used, and their durability is far less than three years, that is, they are rotten and unusable. Stone is not the same, the quality is strong and heavy, it has the ability to resist water itself, and it is firm and durable to use to protect embankments and repair dams, which is by no means comparable to straw materials. Even in terms of labor, the weight of straw is less than one-twentieth of the weight of stone. Its water resistance is such that if one cubic meter of stone is used, 20 cubic meters of straw materials are required. In the East Province, the midstream dams are actually more than the downstream dams, but because they have been modified with stone, there are fewer straw dams and the engineering situation is more stable. That is, in each annual maintenance, each camp purchases only a few hundred piles of straw materials. The total number required for the whole tour is not as large as that of a downstream camp. Moreover, in recent years, each tour of straw dams has been unable to fill the coffers due to insufficient funding and the high price of materials. Every time there is a major flood, the dams and embankments are damaged, which is very worrying. Especially the major flood last year, the dangerous situation was the most severe. If the project is to be stable and permanent, it is necessary to use stone materials heavily and convert the existing straw dams in each tour into stone dams. The proposed plan for renovating each tour of stone dams, as well as improving the methods for mining and transporting stone materials, are listed as follows: (1) Phased methods for renovating stone dams: It is found that there are more than 130 dangerous projects in the three tours, and the dams are close to each other. If the straw dams are converted into stone at the same time, not only the cost will be too high, and it will be difficult to raise funds, but also the required stone materials may not be supplied in large numbers. It is now planned to handle the construction in phases according to the urgency of the project. It is estimated that within 15 years, all the most dangerous dams in the three tours will be converted into stone dams. Every year, 200,000 yuan of special construction funds will be allocated, with 160,000 yuan for purchasing stone materials, averaging about 16,000 cubic meters. The remaining 40,000 yuan will be used for the cost of repairing the dams, as well as salaries, travel expenses, and miscellaneous expenses. (1) Methods for renovating stone dams and mining and transporting materials: It is found that the downstream of the East Province's river engineering is the most dangerous, and the downstream stone has always been mined from Wangkou Mountain in the upstream section of the midstream. The road is long and transportation is difficult. Now that stone materials are used heavily, there must be various methods to solve the difficulties before renovating the stone dams. These are listed below. (A) Develop Huangtai Mountain for nearby mining and transportation: It is calculated that the water distance from Wangkou Mountain in the upstream section of the midstream to transport downstream stone materials ranges from more than 260 li to 500 li. It takes a lot of time and expensive freight for civilian ships to transport back and forth once. It is now planned to set up a factory near Huangtai Mountain downstream of Luokou for nearby mining. The stone materials mined from the mountain are loaded onto ships from Gejiagou and transported to the downstream projects, which can reduce the water distance by more than 140 li. Not only can the freight be saved, but the stone price will also be cheaper. However, Huangtai Mountain is about 5 li away from Gejiagou, so a small railway track must be laid. The stone materials mined from the mountain are loaded onto iron vehicles and transported to the dock, and then loaded onto ships and transported to the project, which can also achieve rapid mining and transportation. The estimated cost of setting up this factory and purchasing small railways is about 20,000 yuan. (B) Improve transportation and reduce freight rates: It is found that there are only more than 10 stone transport boats in the stone material office, so the stone materials estimated by each camp cannot be transported in full. If the straw dams are converted into stone dams, more stone is needed. It is necessary to purchase more boats to increase transportation. However, this kind of transportation relies entirely on manpower. It takes a lot of labor and time to travel back and forth. At this time of high living expenses, the average freight rate is almost four times the price of stone. If mechanical transportation is used instead, the freight rate can be reduced, and the effect of arriving in the evening can be achieved in the morning. It is now planned to purchase a steamship and 16 square boats and arrange them into a team. The square boat is about 8 zhang long, 1.2 zhang wide, and 4 chi deep, and each boat has a specified capacity of 12.5 cubic meters. Four boats are in a group and can load a total of 50 cubic meters of stone. The steamship tows them back and forth. When Group B arrives, Group A returns. When Group C arrives, Group B returns, taking turns loading and unloading. The transportation of stone will inevitably increase. If the stone loading dock is built perfectly, the loading will be convenient, and the boat has a fixed quantity, so there is no need to pile up. The loading and transportation are convenient, and the construction price will be cheap. The estimated cost of purchasing these boats and</p>
<p>Building the dock is about 40,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Launch of the Huainan Coal Mine</h3>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Last summer, the Central Construction Committee prepared to develop the Huainan Coal Mine in Huaiyuan County, northern Anhui Province, allocating an initial investment of 300,000 yuan. The Huainan Coal Mine Bureau was established, with committee member Zhang Jingfen concurrently serving as the Director, and Tang Jingzhou and Cheng Zongyang as Deputy Directors. The mining area has been surveyed at Jiulonggang (15 li from Luohe Street). Surveyors were initially sent to map detailed plans of the mining area, followed by technicians to prepare for excavation. A Huainan Coal Mine Liaison Office was also established on Huachang Street in Bengbu, equipped with a long-distance telephone line directly to Jiulonggang. Zhang Jingfen and others went to Jiulonggang at the end of last month to conduct an on-site inspection. A temporary liaison office has also been set up there. Currently, there are 60 mine police stationed on the mountain, formed last month in Xuzhou and divided into two teams. The overall commander is Liu Defan, with Liu Dequan as the deputy commander and first squad leader, and Liu Huaishan as the second squad leader. At present, the mine police are being trained there to protect the mine while recruitment continues in Xuzhou. The bureau plans to build a transportation railway from the mining area directly to Bengbu. The survey was completed in February, and construction is about to begin. It is reported that for the convenience of transporting coal, the bureau plans to build another transportation railway from the mining area directly to Wuhu, passing through Hefei, Chaoxian, and other places, without using the Jinpu Railway line to ensure smooth transportation without obstruction. This railway project is currently in the planning stage. As for mining and housing construction materials, they have already been purchased and prepared in Luohe Street. Once the machinery and boilers arrive from Shanghai, mining can begin. It is estimated that it will take at least four months before coal can be produced. The mining area produces both bituminous and anthracite coal. The coal quality is good, and the reserves are abundant, with a daily production of about 200 to 300 tons. The future mining results are expected to be considerable. (April 6th)</p>

<h3>Peng Dehuai Captures Yuanzhou</h3>
<p>Party and government agencies all burned down</p>
<p>Deng's brigade has recovered Yuan City</p>
<p>Peng's bandits scattered to Pingxiang and Lianhua</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: The two bandit forces of Zhu Mao and Peng Huang, after the Gonghua incident, Zhu Mao led the pseudo First, Second, and Third Armies to disturb the border of Jiangxi and Guangdong from Nan'an and Xinfeng Dalou, while Peng Dehuai led the pseudo Fourth and Fifth Armies to ravage western Jiangxi and both banks of the Gan River from Ji'an to Zhangshu. It is found that Peng's bandits have about 5,000 people and more than 3,000 guns. Previously, because the attack on Jishui and Ji'an was unsuccessful, they besieged Anfu, Gao'an, Shanggao, and Fenyi counties. They were repelled by the Tang and Deng brigades and the police brigade. However, when Peng's bandits withdrew from Fenyi, they advanced towards Yuanzhou (i.e., Yichun) County from Binjiang in three routes. On the 23rd of last month, they had surrounded the county seat. At that time, there was only one company of soldiers in the city. County Magistrate Cai Shu, together with the company and the Jingwei Team, closed the city and defended it to the death. After 18 hours of fierce fighting, at about 4:00 pm on the 24th, the city was captured due to the exhaustion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements. The county magistrate disguised himself and escaped from the city to Fenyi. After the bandits entered the city, they burned down the county government, the Qingxiang Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Party Headquarters, and the prison. All the prisoners were released, and the documents of the public groups were all burned. Shops of all sizes inside and outside the city were either extorted and then burned, robbed and then burned, burned if they did not pay, or burned because the people were not in the shop. All kinds of tragic situations are difficult to describe. After County Magistrate Cai escaped to Fenyi, he telegraphed Deng's brigade for assistance. Brigade Commander Deng ordered the Wang and Li regiments to lead more than 3,000 people to advance towards Yichun with County Magistrate Cai. On the 26th, they began to contact the bandits. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, Deng's brigade soldiers charged more than ten times, killing more than a thousand bandits before breaking through the main force of the bandits. Peng's bandits, unable to support themselves, collapsed and retreated out of the city through the south and west gates at 6:00 pm on the 28th, fleeing to Nanmiao, Zhongcun Lukou and other places under the county's jurisdiction. It is said that they turned to harass Lianhua, Pingxiang, and Wanzai counties. In Yichun city, ruined walls, broken tiles, and broken bodies were everywhere. The county government documents were completely destroyed. Yesterday, the provincial government and the headquarters of the 18th Division received telegrams from Regiment Commander Wang and County Magistrate Cai, reporting the above situation in detail.</p>
<p>After the General Command for Bandit Suppression in the province entered Ji'an on the 3rd, it has decided on the second step of the bandit suppression plan, and ordered the county magistrates of each county to state their opinions on bandit suppression for selection. In addition, Chairman Lu found that the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs often fled at the first sign of bandit alarm, so that the communists were able to act recklessly. In addition to detaining the Wanzai County Magistrate and Public Security Bureau Chief who left their posts without authorization, he also telegraphed yesterday to the county magistrates of each county, urging them to be loyal to their duties, and to live or die with the city.

<h3>The Great Wind Disaster in the Provincial Capital of Guangdong</h3>
<p>Dozens of people injured, killed, or drowned; the Jianghan warship sank</p>
<p>On the same day, ships traveling between Taishan and Xinchang were also sunk by the wind</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: In Ducheng, in the upper reaches of the West River in Guangdong Province, at about 6:00 am on the 30th of last month, a hurricane and hailstorm suddenly appeared, which had not been seen in a century, causing significant losses. That morning, a strong gale suddenly blew from the northwest, sweeping from the sea to the market, like ten thousand horses galloping, and dragons roaring and tigers howling. While residents were running for shelter, hailstones as large as chicken eggs suddenly fell from the sky, destroying about a dozen houses. The roof of a primary school in the city was also destroyed by the wind and hail. The Guangde Pawnshop was also blown down. Four men and women were crushed to death in the city, more than a dozen were seriously injured, and thirty were slightly injured. The anti-smoking inspection station on the riverbank completely collapsed, injuring five people. The disaster on the river was even more tragic. The Jianghan warship, which was anchored on the Ducheng river, was also sunk by the wind. It is found that the ship was one of the four major ships of the Jiangfang fleet. It departed to Wuzhou for combat a few days ago, and was recently ordered to return to the West River, cruising between Deqing and Ducheng to protect passing ships. Captain Pan Guoliu stayed in Wuzhou on official business, and only the deputy captain and dozens of officers and soldiers were on the ship. That morning, a strong wind suddenly rose, and the ship was directly hit. Because the west flow was turbulent, the ship's anchor was first broken. The ship lost support, the hurricane followed, and the ship sank into the river. Although all the officers and soldiers on the ship shouted for help, the ships had moved to other places to avoid the wind, and no one could rescue them. After a while, the ship sank into the water, and all the masts were not visible on the surface. Recently, the West River water level has risen six or seven feet higher than last month, and it will be difficult to tow the ship up in the future. On that day, the deputy captain and fifty or sixty officers and soldiers were mostly buried in the bellies of fish. About thirty people were rescued, which was also tragic. Because the wind and rain were urgent, the wires were also blown off. Therefore, the Fourth Fleet Command here only received the alarm the day after the ship sank. On the evening of the first, technicians and others were sent to the scene of the accident by the Suijiang warship. The Suijiang arrived on the morning of the second, and after the investigation was clear, personnel will be sent to find a way to recover the ship. It is heard that the Jianghan warship was invaluable, and the loss of the entire ship this time is no less than hundreds of thousands. On the morning of that day, in addition to the sinking of the Jianghan warship, hundreds of other civilian ships and small boats were blown to the river surface in Ducheng, half of which sank and half of which drifted with the waves. Fortunately, most of them were boatmen who could swim. It is estimated that about 300 men and women were rescued, and more than 20 young children drowned. The belongings on the boat have been washed away. The local party headquarters is now trying to accommodate the refugees. It is estimated that about 400 people are homeless, and the public hospital is temporarily used as a shelter. Also, on the Siyi side, the Xinhaishan steamboat, which travels between Taishan and Xinchangbu, was also sunk by a strong wind at Sanshe River on the same day. The ship had about 70 or 80 passengers. Except for 40 or 50 people rescued, it is estimated that 20 or 30 people drowned. Only twelve bodies were recovered the day before yesterday, and the rest have drifted away with the waves.

<h3>Zhang Xueliang Appointed Commander-in-Chief of Aviation</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Zhang Xueliang, Commander of the Northeast Border Defense Army, concurrently served as Commander-in-Chief of the Aviation Army. At 12:00 noon today, the inauguration ceremony was held at the Dongta Aviation Office. Because the duties of the Commander-in-Chief were too heavy for him to handle concurrently, Zhang Huanxiang will be the acting Commander-in-Chief. The position of Deputy Commander will be promoted from the original captain Xu Shiying. Zhang arrived on time with Adjutant Tan Haihua. Fang Benren, representative of the National Government, and more than fifty important civil and military officials had arrived earlier. After the ceremony, Deputy Commander Xu Shiying read the oath of office on behalf of him. The words said, "We and our subordinates must abide by military discipline, absolutely obey orders, and do our best in our duties." After the reading, Zhang gave a public speech, saying that the Northeast Aviation Team has been reorganized into the Northeast Aviation Army today. Past experience has made us clear that the knowledge and training of the current aviation officers are not sufficient, so that it is nominal and regrettable. Now, in order to supplement the knowledge of all officers, it is decided to change the organization and increase a senior officer to supervise everything. Today's officers should step down to the status of students, and learn seriously. It must be known that the existing rank is not obtained by merit, and it should not be that because the rank is higher, they are unwilling to humble themselves to learn. From now on, we must break the line and work hard to learn, so that the Northeast Air Force is a useful air force that can apply science, and do not follow the mistakes of the former Chinese Navy. In the future, the acting Commander-in-Chief and Deputy Commander will strictly assess, and no favoritism will be allowed. Those who have achievements will be rewarded, and those who have no achievements will be punished. Those who destroy discipline and disregard the honor of the Northeast Aviation Army, even if they are executed by shooting, will not be spared." After the speech, all the people present went to the backyard to take pictures. Later, Zhang also introduced the acting Commander-in-Chief Zhang Huanxiang and Chief of Staff Chen Haihua to all the officers, and there was a very long speech. The main point was that by taking off the military uniform, they can be teachers and students to each other, and can be friends. There is no need to be polite when something happens. However, when wearing military uniforms, they should absolutely obey orders, otherwise they can be dealt with by military law. When speaking, his voice was stern. Finally, Zhang and all the people present walked to the airfield for inspection. There were 40 large and small aircraft. There were more than 100 aircraft that did not participate in the inspection. Zhang inspected for ten weeks and then took a car back home. (April 1st)</p>
<h3>The Harbin International Association Newspaper Was Destroyed</h3>
<p>The reason was for refusing to publish a reactionary declaration</p>
<p>Harbin Correspondence, 2nd: The Harbin International Association Newspaper was destroyed by the Communist Party at 11:00 am today, causing significant losses. All sectors of Harbin society are paying close attention. Newspaper offices and news agencies are especially concerned about the dangers faced by their peers. An emergency joint meeting was held at about 9:00 pm, and four items were resolved: (1) Representatives were immediately sent, one from each newspaper office, to the Governor's Office and various authorities to petition. If there is no proper solution within three days, all newspapers will suspend publication uniformly, and will not resume business until the problem is resolved. (2) The authorities were requested to arrest the culprits within three days and severely punish them. The authorities were asked to clarify who should be responsible for the damage to the International Association Newspaper, and other newspaper offices and news agencies should be effectively protected, and it should be guaranteed that such incidents will not happen again in the future. Newspaper offices and news agencies will be allowed to take armed self-defense if such incidents occur again in the future. (3) A telegram was sent to the whole country, requesting unified assistance. (4) In the future, no matter which newspaper office or news agency this happens to again, the industry will take unified action and help each other. After the meeting, the representatives who were elected went to the Special Zone Governor's Office, the Special Police Office, and the Daowai Public Security Bureau to see the authorities. Because it was already a banquet, Zhang Jinghui and Bao Wenjie were not there, and they left a petition and returned. That night, the major leaders of the Special Zone gathered at the Governor's Office for a meeting to discuss the aftermath of the International Association Newspaper case and the maintenance of local security. As a result, the Harbin Academy, which was not registered and had reactionary implications, was banned, and its students were disbanded. The management office ordered the arrest of the rioters who destroyed the International Association Newspaper, and they must be captured and interrogated overnight. Local security was tightened. Also, after 11:00 pm that night, more than a hundred people, similar to workers and students, gathered at the Harbin Academy in Qinjagang. The police detected this and sent a large team to surround and arrest more than ten people, all of whom were related to the destruction of the newspaper office. The president of the academy, Wang Xibai, and the director, Yu Ergui, escaped upon hearing the news and could not be captured. As for the details of the incident, on the evening of the 31st of last month, four Harbin Academy students, claiming to be representatives of the Harbin Freedom League, went to the International Association Newspaper and the Daowai Chenguang Newspaper, requesting to publish their declaration. Both newspapers refused to publish it because the content contained reactionary language. When the representative left, he said that if it was not published, the newspaper office would be destroyed and they would not be responsible. Both newspapers notified the police station that night, requesting protection. On the morning of the first, more than a hundred people, similar to workers and students, paraded in the streets, shouting reactionary slogans and distributing leaflets containing communist propaganda. Because the International Association Newspaper was heavily guarded, they crossed the street and went to the Chenguang Newspaper at 11:00 am. They shouted and cursed outside the door, wanting to enter and destroy it. Several representatives went upstairs to find the person in charge and questioned why they did not publish their declaration. Zhang Shuping, the editor-in-chief of the newspaper, came out to see them and told them that it was difficult for him to publish it. At that time, the rioters outside the door shouted and roared, and their momentum was fierce. Zhang repeatedly debated, and the rioters, seeing that there were more and more onlookers, did not dare to be too fierce, and posted a declaration outside the door and left. On the 2nd, the International Association Newspaper lifted the alert because the matter had passed. Unexpectedly, dozens of rioters gathered students in the style of ruffians from various schools early in the morning, first went to the Education Department of Qinjagang to petition, requesting permission for the Harbin Academy to register. The Education Department ignored them. The rioters waited for a long time without news, so they went to the International Association Newspaper, overturned seven racks of movable type in the factory, and trampled on them. A group of rioters went upstairs to search for the staff of the editorial department. Because the staff had not yet come to work, the rioters, seeing that there was nothing to do, destroyed the telephone and retreated. At that time, Zhang Fusheng, the president of the newspaper, rushed back to the newspaper office upon hearing the news, and notified the police on the one hand, and checked the losses on the other hand. Only seven racks of new lead type were worth about six or seven thousand yuan. The other scattered items that were destroyed could not be counted. The newspaper immediately sent a telegram to the Liaoning Border Defense Commander's Office, requesting that the Harbin authorities be ordered to deal with the aftermath, and telegraphed to major newspapers in the country, asking for their support. It is found that the Communist Party has been very active in Harbin recently, such as the Anti-Imperialist League, the League for Freedom, and other communist organizations, using false pretenses to create a great terror in Harbin within three months. The planned steps are to first surround public opinion and make it lose its authority, in order to be conducive to the records of their party. The authorities are ignorant, and they turn a blind eye to the rampant actions of the party, so that these people become more and more troublesome. The labor unrest and student unrest in Harbin have been happening one after another, and a crisis has been hidden in the society. When the Kaiming Bookstore was searched a few days ago, the party realized that the truth was gradually revealed, so it took a further clear action. It is heard that the behind-the-scenes manipulators of such incidents are Wang Xichen, the president of Harbin Academy, and Yu Ergui, the principal of the Eighth District Middle School and director of Harbin Academy, and several other people. After the incident happened today, both of them escaped. The Harbin Academy was ordered to be disbanded by the authorities.</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3>The Bandits in Yangcheng Lake Have Been Repelled</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Zhang Ting, the second battalion commander of the Taihu Bandit Suppression Army, led his troops to suppress the lake bandits fiercely in the Sanzhuang area between Weiting Zhengyi on the 2nd of this month. He then transferred the 6th, 7th, and 8th companies to garrison Chefang. After the lake bandits were suppressed by Zhang's battalion, they fled to the Sanyuanchang of Chenji. The Chen Company of the first battalion of the 28th Bandit Suppression Army went to suppress them on the 4th, and the bandits collapsed and retreated. At 3:00 pm on the 6th, Battalion Commander Zhang, who was stationed in Chefang, reported that two large groups of lake bandits were found in Jiulinghu and Dayao Jinshan Temple near Chefang. Each group had more than 30 ships, and the total number of bandits was 800 to 900. One group sailed towards Jiulinghu, and the other group docked at Jinshan Temple. Battalion Commander Zhang, upon receiving the report, immediately led the Seventh Company and a platoon of machine guns, taking civilian boats and towing them with small wheels, to suppress them. They landed on the shore of Shenjiatang Village and charged towards the destination. At that time, most of the bandits were in Jinshan Temple. Seeing that officers and soldiers were coming to attack, they dispersed and opened fire to meet the enemy. The sound of guns and cannons was loud for a while. Battalion Commander Zhang commanded the troops, bravely charged, and fiercely suppressed them, killing more than ten bandits and capturing six bandit ships. There were two bandits in the ships. At that time, the bandits who did not have time to get off the ship fled to Songjiabang and other places. The forests there were dense, and the bandits used them to shield themselves from the target of the officers and soldiers. Later, a group of bandits from Jiulinghu also returned to Jinshan Temple to help resist the officers and soldiers. As a result, the bandit forces were strengthened, and they launched a fierce attack on the officers and soldiers. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers had occupied the high ground of Jinshan Temple and were able to defeat the many with the few. However, the bandits also resisted stubbornly, causing more than ten army soldiers to be injured. All of them were carried to Pan Shang with the help of villagers. Among them, there were a squad leader and a bugler, each of whom was seriously injured. The military and bandits fought fiercely until about 9:00 pm, when the bandits retreated into Cheng Lake one after another, and continued to fight against the officers and soldiers. The officers and soldiers were all on land and could not move forward. Returning fire to the bandits was not as powerful. Battalion Commander Zhang then ordered Staff Officer Liu to take the wounded soldiers back to Chefang by wheel. At first, it was planned to order the second platoon of the first squadron of the county police stationed there to go to the front line to assist, but because the police team guarded the key points, it was difficult to mobilize. Therefore, Staff Officer Liu transferred the fifth company of soldiers stationed in Xietang by telephone. After arriving at Chefang at about 10:00 pm, they transferred to the front line of Jinshan Temple to join the battle. At that time, a part of the bandits who had retreated into the lake landed again, so Battalion Commander Zhang commanded the troops to encircle and suppress them. At 1:00 am on the 7th, the bandits collapsed and retreated towards Cheng Lake. At the same time, the Bandit Suppression Command, according to the report from the military telephone, learned that the firepower of the officers and soldiers was insufficient after the bandits retreated into Cheng Lake, so it allocated two steel cannons, 6,000 rounds of rifle bullets, and 5,000 rounds of machine gun bullets that night at 12:00, and sent them by a police ship. In this battle, more than 40 bandits were killed and Zhang Pinhua, Lu Tongsheng, Gu Xinggen, and Xu Xiaodi were captured. On the army side, three people were killed and fourteen were injured. Nine of the seriously injured were sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and the remaining five were sent to Gengsheng Hospital outside Qimen for treatment. Now Battalion Commander Zhang is still leading his troops to search and suppress them in the area. Gong Guoliang, the third district chief of the Suzhou Water Police, also led his team to Cheng Lake on the 7th to pursue and suppress the fleeing bandits. According to the villagers who came to the city from Dayao, the lake bandits who fired on the army in this battle were wearing miscellaneous uniforms. The firearms were long guns, box cannons, and pistols. Red cloth was tied on the wrists and gun handles as a mark, and there were also more than a dozen female bandits, all of whom were young and quite beautiful. By 1:00 am on the 7th, the bandits could not hold on and retreated east to Cheng Lake, but by about 6:00 am, faint gunshots could still be heard from Cheng Lake.</p>
<p>In addition, the Jiaozhi County Public Security Bureau also sent police to the Xuxu Temple today and found more than 20 pieces of luggage left by the bandits. Therefore, it is known that the bandits had spent the night in the Xuxu Temple beforehand. (Evening of the 7th)</p>
<p>Suzhou Continued News: The Seventh Company of the Second Battalion of the 25th Bandit Suppression Regiment opened fire with a large group of lake bandits in the Dayao area of Chefang Township the day before yesterday. It is said that the gang of lake bandits was a combination of the Haizhou and Siyang gangs. The bandit leader Zhang Zhaohua robbed Zhangyan Town in Jinshan County on the 1st of this month, and then fled back to Dianshan Lake to gather at Dayao. A meeting was held at the Jinshan Temple there. The stationed troops detected this and went to encircle and suppress them. They opened fire at 3:00 pm on the 6th, and the bandits began to collapse towards Yangcheng Lake at about 12:00 midnight. After investigation, in addition to more than 30 bandits being injured or killed, nine large and small hostages were rescued. All of them have been brought back to the General Command and their origins are being investigated one by one. (1) Zhang Yejin, ten years old, from Xinhang, Zhangyan.

<p>Today (the 8th) morning, the Second Battalion of the 25th Regiment also escorted a wounded ticket, Fei Yuxiang, to the Bandit Suppression Command. After being interrogated by the military court, he confessed that he was 20 years old, from Chajiatai, Beizha, Linghu, Wuxing, Zhejiang. He was kidnapped on February 12 while buying fish seedlings in Dongshan, Dingting. There were a total of twelve bandit ships at that time, and three tickets had already been kidnapped elsewhere. They were hidden in the boat together with Fei. The military judge sent Fei Yuxiang, who was seriously injured, to Huayan Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, Gong Guoliang, the director of the Third District of the Water Police, led his teams, towed by the Peirong Zhenwei patrol ships and the Zhizhong speedboat, to Chenmu, Zhouzhuang, Jiaozhi, Xinta, Luxu and other places on the 2nd of this month, patrolling Yangcheng Lake and Dianshan Lake. At 3:00 pm on the 6th, the teams gathered at Shenjiabang, Fenghu, a few miles away from Luxu Town, and encountered more than 20 bandit ships led by the Shanghai gang Taibao A Shu (about 200 bandits). Seeing the officers and soldiers approaching, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. Director Gong immediately ordered the troops to return fire. The two sides opened fire for about an hour, and the bandits fled in different directions towards Dianshan Lake after running out of ammunition. Three bandit ships were shot down, a young ticket was rescued, and five rifles were captured. Director Gong returned to Suzhou this morning. The Water Public Security Team under his command is still deployed in the Yangcheng Lake area.

They are from Hongkou, Shanghai, one is 18 years old and the other is 14 years old. Their whereabouts are now unknown. After Director Gong returned to Suzhou, he prepared a document together with the ticket and sent them to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters for disposal. (8th)</p>

<h3>松江</h3>
<p>Jiang Erchang Arrested: Jiang Erchang, the former Executive Committee Member and Head of the Propaganda Department of this county, is currently engaged in quarrying stone from Tianma Mountain. On the 7th, the county government received a report from Zhang Fangqin, a resident of Tianma Mountain, stating that his uncle, Zhang Youshu, was coerced and taken away at gunpoint by Jiang Erchang's household, and is currently being held captive in Jiang's home, shackled with iron chains, only being released briefly during mealtimes. He requested the dispatch of a team for rescue, and claimed that Jiang's family possesses many firearms, etc. County Magistrate Jin immediately secretly ordered the second squad of the police team, leading ten armed officers, to go to the countryside at night accompanied by the reporter. They arrived in the town on the morning of the 8th, and together with Officer Chen from the Tianma Mountain branch station, went to arrest him at the address. Upon entering the house, they found Zhang Youshu's hands and feet bound by iron chains, which they immediately released. They began a search and discovered 1,545 assorted bullets, five assorted bayonets, one five-colored national flag, and a broken mahjong set. However, Jiang himself was not at home. They then detained his mother, Jiang Xie, and quarry workers Chen Wanzhang, Ma Yinghao, Xia Wansheng, and Yu Runtang, and escorted them onto a boat to return to Songjiang. The police team assigned five officers to watch the prisoners on the boat, while five officers proceeded on land to prevent accidents en route. As the boat was approaching the north of the town, they saw two people lying in ambush on the shore, armed and seemingly about to attack. The police team on land spotted them and moved forward to arrest them. The ambushers immediately fled and hid in a villager's home. The police team pursued them relentlessly and apprehended one of them. The other one escaped without a trace. The arrested person was identified by the reporter as being none other than Jiang Erchang, the main culprit who had kidnapped his uncle. He was also escorted onto the boat and taken to Songjiang to be handed over to the county. Officer Chen of the town later received a report from villager Tang Yisheng, stating that someone had fled into his house, leaving behind firearms and ammunition during the chase. He requested that they be retrieved. Officer Chen immediately went to Tang's house and found a rifle, five rows of bullets, a six-inch Browning pistol, thirty-three bullets (all loaded and not secured), a coat, and a rain hat. These were identified as the weapons and clothing discarded by Jiang Erchang after he fled into Tang's house. This has also been reported to the county by Officer Chen. The matter is currently under strict investigation. However, according to what Jiang told the police officers after his arrest, his younger sister was abducted by Zhang Youshu's nephew, who also took away many of her belongings. Therefore, he locked Youshu in his home, hoping that his abducted younger sister could be returned soon. He denied kidnapping for ransom. It is reported that the county's reorganization committee has telegraphed the provincial reorganization committee for instructions.</p>
<p>Qianjiawei Town Robbed by Bandits: Qianjiawei Town, belonging to Jinshan County, is only eighteen li away from Zhangyan Town. After the robbery in Zhangyan, rumors spread in the town, and merchants and residents were uneasy. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 6th, more than forty bandits arrived, all carrying rifles and pistols. They entered the town and looted fourteen shops, including Tang Shunchang, causing a total loss of approximately one thousand yuan. The Zhangyan Public Security Bureau chief, upon hearing the news, immediately sent a team to Qianjiawei to suppress the bandits. They exchanged fire, and the bandits fled towards the Xinjing area. It is rumored that this group also belongs to the "Taibao Ashu" gang. The Songjiang water police team has dispatched a ship to intercept them.</p>
<p>Recent News After the Zhangyan Robbery: After Zhangyan Town was robbed by lake bandits on the evening of the 1st, no relief efforts have been arranged. Furthermore, all the shops feel that their goods are incomplete and uneven, so they have not yet reopened. As of the 6th, among the men and women who were kidnapped, some have been released successively, but it is reported that there are still fourteen people who need to be ransomed. The bandits are demanding a huge sum of 100,000 yuan for Li Xinglin, the chairman of the chamber of commerce and manager of Yuanchang, but the Li family is not wealthy and cannot afford such a large sum. According to reports, on the day the bandits entered Zhangyan, the defense corps had received the news and were waiting. When they saw the first batch of three "Wushan" boats arriving, the defense corps fired machine guns. The three boats carried thirty-seven bandits, all skilled in shooting, who were assigned to be the vanguard. Unexpectedly, all were killed by machine guns. Subsequently, large numbers of bandits arrived continuously and went ashore to confront them, becoming increasingly numerous. The defense corps was unable to withstand them and retreated. Therefore, the bandit gang suffered considerable losses. According to the bandits and the released hostages, there are still eight bandit corpses that have not been found.</p>

<p>Lake Bandits Have Been Repelled by the Military and Police: Since lake bandits were discovered in various areas of the western countryside of this county, the situation has been tense, and rumors have arisen. After the military and police jointly suppressed them on three fronts, they have routed the lake bandits, who have retreated towards the Dian Lake area. However, the western countryside has many crisscrossing rivers and harbors, close to Dian Lake and Mao Lake. Although they are now distant, it is still difficult to completely eliminate them in the near future.</p>
<p>Young Woman Seduced and Flees with Lover: Cui, a resident of Fangjiawei Town in Qingpu County, is in his thirties and married to a woman named Zhang, who is twenty-four years old and somewhat attractive. She was seduced and bewitched by a police officer named Jia, stationed on the No. 5 boat in the town. On a certain day last month, she fled with him to Sijing Town in Songjiang County. By chance, Cui's cousin, Wang, spotted her in Sijing and secretly reported it to the public security bureau and defense corps of the town. The public security bureau and defense corps then dispatched police officers to pursue and arrest her. The seducing police officer took the opportunity to escape. Later, the woman was taken to the public security bureau, and Wang sent a letter to Cui. The next day, Cui went to the Sijing Public Security Bureau to take his wife back. The town chief, Chen Runchen, considered that the police officer's seduction and abduction of a woman from a good family was a matter of public morals, so he sent a letter to Captain Hao, requesting that the police officer be arrested and severely punished. Captain Hao, upon receiving the letter, was very angry and ordered his subordinates to arrest him. He also reported the whole incident to his superiors.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Hostages Kidnapped from Dragon King Temple Are All Safe: The Dragon King Temple, seven li away from the city, was robbed by bandits armed with weapons last month. The Jiahe and Ning'an steamboats were robbed, and more than sixty hostages were kidnapped. Forty or fifty people were released successively. The remaining hostages were ransomed separately. After repeated pleas, they were all released from Siducun, Taihu Lake, on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Luhu Detachment Stationed in Zhouzhuang: A bandit ship arrived in Luhu Town, belonging to the county, last month and extorted more than 3,000 yuan from the townspeople, causing panic. The day before yesterday, Commander Zhao specially stationed the entire third battalion and the first, second, and third companies of the first battalion in Luhu. The town's police force is now strong. Yesterday (the 6th), Commander Zhao sent the second and third companies of the first battalion to Zhouzhuang to deter them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Please Exempt Slaughter Tax and Construction Special Levy: In the case of Wuxi's slaughter tax with a construction special levy, the county construction bureau received orders from the provincial department last year, urging them to collect it strictly. However, the meat merchants tried to reduce or exempt it, and the two sides insisted on their positions. Until the winter, the construction department finally approved to first collect half of the amount from December, donating five cents of silver for each slaughtered pig, with three months as a trial period. Now that the trial period has long expired, the construction department has repeatedly ordered the construction bureau to transfer the order to the slaughter tax contractor, Wang Yun'gong, to collect the full amount from March 1st. However, the meat merchants believe that last year's autumn harvest was poor, the market was bleak, and the fresh meat business was sluggish. After deliberation by the entire industry, they requested the construction department to cancel the construction special levy collected with the slaughter tax to alleviate business difficulties. The meat industry director, Jiang Hongzhang, has submitted the situation to the chamber of commerce, requesting it to forward the request on his behalf. The chamber of commerce submitted a request yesterday, asking the construction department to approve the cancellation of the original plan.</p>
<p>County Police Team Arrests Reactionary Suspects: Wuxi County Magistrate Sun Zuji has repeatedly received secret reports that reactionary elements are hiding in and around the city, plotting mischief. Shen Dagou, who was involved in the ax gang case secretly organized by Chen Nianzu, a standing committee member of the Shenxin Trade Union last year, has recently secretly returned to Wuxi and is secretly active. Reactionary slogans have been frequently found in the Badaitou area of the Shenxin factory outside the West Gate. After receiving the report, County Magistrate Sun immediately secretly ordered Zhu Zhenguo, the captain of the county police brigade, to go and arrest them. Captain Zhu, upon receiving the order, led special agents Wan Shen Rongting and others, disguised as workers, to Shenxin Factory No. 81 in the middle of the night the day before yesterday to carry out a search and arrest. They arrested Zhang San Da and Tang Xiangchen on the spot. Then they heard the roof tiles of No. 83 shaking, searched the roof, and arrested Shen Dagou, who was wanted by provincial order, and Chen A'qiao, another suspect, in the gap. They took Shen Dagou and the other three back to the brigade headquarters together. According to Shen Dagou's confession, he is 36 years old and from Yuqi. Last year, because of the Chen Nianzu case, he had served as the deputy standing committee member of the trade union. After Chen and others were arrested, he went to Caojiadu, Shanghai, to work as a handyman to make a living. He recently returned to Wuxi to seek business opportunities and was suddenly arrested. He firmly denied posting slogans. Zhang San Da confessed that he is 30 years old, from Qingcheng City, Nan Shuangmiao, and is currently a supervisor of the Shenxin Trade Union. He was very unwilling to do it and was forced to do so by the labor rectification committee. They did not hold secret meetings. Because the factory had a surplus of more than 900,000 last year, the workers should have received 6% according to regulations, but the factory only agreed to give 29,000 yuan. Because of this issue, they had been holding meetings to negotiate with the capitalists. He firmly denied being a member of the reorganization faction or possessing firearms. Tang Xiangchen confessed that he is 24 years old and from Wuxi. He did not ask about the posting of slogans by the reorganization faction. Zhang San Da is a very good person, so he was elected as a supervisor. Chen A'qiao confessed that he is 28 years old, from Dongtai. He usually works as a laborer, hauling manure, or pushing carts, and does not know anything about posting slogans. After receiving the confessions, Captain Zhu immediately prepared a document and sent them to the county, where Judge Zhou Chengshen conducted a trial. Because the case was related to reactionaries, he ordered them to be detained together pending investigation.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Hoarding and Speculation: Wuxi County Government recently considered that rice prices are soaring, exceeding 16 yuan per stone, which is not only related to people's livelihood but also to local security. At the last meeting on food relief, in addition to deciding to purchase 1,000 tons of foreign rice to provide relief, they decided to strictly investigate and prohibit smuggling and hoarding. Yesterday, they issued a notice strictly prohibiting hoarding, speculation, and smuggling, and allowing people to report them. Once verified and caught, they will be severely punished. At the same time, they ordered the social investigation office to conduct a strict investigation and report every five days to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>Sodomy Case Occurs at Yihe Inn: Guo Ruiliang, a native of Jiangpoqiao Township, Jingyun City, belonging to the county, is a man who likes boys. Because he stayed at the Yihe Inn in Huangnibu, he had a homosexual relationship with Fei Yaoqing, a tea room attendant at the inn, and they were very close. Unexpectedly, his wife, Li, discovered the truth the day before yesterday and reported it to the police. They were both brought to the public security bureau, where Section Chief Qian Yaonian conducted a trial. According to Fei Li's confession, she had recently noticed that her husband's face was gaunt and, after much questioning, learned that her husband had been engaging in sodomy with Guo Ruiliang for two months. Fei Yaoqing confessed that he is 46 years old. Guo Ruiliang came to the inn on the sixteenth day of the first lunar month this year and stayed in the same bed with him, and they engaged in sodomy. Since then, Guo has come to bother him every two or three days and gave him two yuan per night. Guo Ruiliang confessed that he is 26 years old and used to work as a worker in the Hongda foundry in Shanghai. After staying at the inn, he had a sodomy affair with Fei Yaoqing and paid him two yuan for the room, etc. After receiving the confessions, Mr. Qian considered that Guo and Fei were both shameless and ordered them to be detained together. They were transferred to the county government for trial yesterday.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Patrol Leader Who Released Rice Boat Without Authorization Detained: The Erfen resident station of the Sifen Bureau of the Wuyi Public Security Bureau detained three rice boats heading abroad from Weicun. The county government was seeking instructions from the civil affairs department on how to handle the case. However, rice merchant Qian Fengtai and others, taking advantage of the fact that Patrol Officer Zhang Hanqin had come to the city, asked Zou Yubing, an assistant at the district office, to compel Guo Qinghai, the patrol leader guarding the rice boats, to release the boats. The Public Security Bureau, upon receiving the report, sent a team to the bureau on the 7th to escort Patrol Officer Guo. After a brief interrogation, he was transferred to the county court for trial. Patrol Officer Guo confessed the circumstances of being forced to release the boats. He was immediately ordered to be detained. As for Zou Yubing and others, the county government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest and escort them for trial.</p>
<p>Citywide Blacksmith Strike: Blacksmiths throughout Wuyi City, due to soaring rice prices and difficult living conditions, jointly demanded that the shop owners increase their wages. They requested an increase of eight cents based on the original daily wage of two dimes and two cents, for a total daily wage of two dimes. The shop owners, due to poor business and lack of profits, were unable to agree. The blacksmiths immediately went on strike yesterday and will not stop until their demands are met. The shop owners then agreed to increase the wage by one or two cents. If they have to increase it to eight cents, they can only manage to cope. Therefore, this strike is not easy to resolve.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Court Executes Kidnappers by Firing Squad: Kidnappers Yu Chunhai, from Henan, and Zhang Deqing, from Anhui, along with fugitive Yang Genyuan and others, robbed Yang Huaide's house in Yanggang, Gaozi Township, of clothing and other items. They also kidnapped Yang's nine-year-old grandson and extorted a total of 1,520 yuan, which they divided and spent. In September last year, the two bandits again agreed to come to Zhenjiang to redeem cotton clothes. They were arrested by the detective team and sent to the local court's prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution. After trial, they were sentenced to death. The case was submitted to the Jiangsu Higher Court and then to the provincial government for review. The provincial government, after deliberation, sent a secret letter to the court to carry out the original sentence. Therefore, at 2 p.m. yesterday, Prosecutor Xu identified the two criminals and escorted them to the new execution ground outside the North Gate to be executed by firing squad.</p>

At about 8 p.m. yesterday, twenty-six or twenty-seven bandits with mixed accents, painted faces, red and green ribbons tied around their heads, carrying broadswords and pistols, rushed in. They immediately raped Qiu's daughter, Lin Bao, with many bandits taking turns, causing her severe injuries. She is now barely breathing. They then kidnapped Mr. and Mrs. Qiu. As they were leaving, some gamblers were returning and mistakenly thought that the police were coming to arrest them. The bandits fired shots, injuring Zhou Changxing in the left calf.

As for how the county, district, and village councils will allocate and use the funds, it is said that it will depend on the size of the population, the amount of land tax, the strength of the financial resources, and the burden on the people.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Two Fire Accidents: The back house of the Yuanli rice store warehouse behind the Xiajia Bridge outside the south gate of Ningbo City suddenly caught fire at about 6 a.m. yesterday.

<p>Letters to the Editor</p>
<h3>Letter from Yang Shijie of Songjiang:</h3>
<p>I was shocked to read the news about the divorce dispute in the Songjiang communication column of your newspaper's April 2nd foreign news. The details described in it are completely inconsistent with the facts. After I married Chen Yunyu, because of her violent nature, she often insulted my elders, and recently even pushed my mother down, causing her to be frightened, and left home for several days without returning, I filed a complaint with the Songjiang County Government requesting a divorce. Although it has been rejected by the Songjiang County First Instance, I am currently appealing. Therefore, my divorce from Ms. Chen Yunyu is entirely of my own volition and has nothing to do with my sister. Chen Yunyu has become even more unscrupulous after the verdict, gathering hooligans to harass my home. I am waiting for the legal solution and will not deal with her. The news said that I and my husband found my belongings, children's hats, etc. in my husband's sister's room, all of which are unfounded. As for the sections on secretly burning Yunyu's clothes and bedding, it is even more untrue. I am sending this letter to your editor and asking you to publish it in the "Letters to the Editor" column as soon as possible to clarify the truth. With sincere regards, Yang Shijie, April 6th.</p>
<h3>Letter from Yang Dinghou:</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I previously read in the local communications column of the third page of your newspaper on the 3rd of this month that Yang Dinghou, the director of the Qingpu Public Security Branch Bureau, was accused of being removed from his post. I checked that I was reappointed as the director of the Zhujiajiao Public Security Branch Bureau for the second time in May last year. Since taking office, it has been more than a year. Although I have not made any contributions to my job, I am fortunate that the local area is peaceful and I can barely fulfill my duties. However, recently, I have been suffering from minor ailments, resulting in a weak body, confused spirit, and difficult economic situation in the bureau, which is not enough to allocate, and it is very difficult to handle local affairs. Therefore, I specially applied for a long vacation to avoid mistakes in the future. Fortunately, I was approved by the Qingpu County Government and appointed Zhang Huaijin to take over. I handed over the matter clearly and reported it on the 3rd of this month. The report in your newspaper that the Civil Affairs Department removed Yang from his post is not in accordance with the facts and greatly hinders my reputation and future. Therefore, I am sending this letter to ask you to correct it immediately. With gratitude, Yang Dinghou, former director of the Qingpu County Public Security First Branch Bureau, April 6th.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Major Disturbance on Beijing Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>One Person Killed by Gunfire</p>
<p>Several People Detained</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reported that at 9:30 yesterday morning, forty to fifty workers and students were planning to hold a meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Association. Since the association had already taken precautions, the waiting patrolmen reported it to the police station by phone. The police station immediately dispatched five foreign patrolmen and sixteen Chinese patrolmen to disperse them and arrested three ringleaders. The crowd then moved to Beijing Road. At that time, the number had reached one hundred to two hundred people, planning to transfer from a certain candy store to a certain grand theater for a meeting. A shop assistant named Lin came out to stop them and was beaten. A Chinese patrolman standing there saw the beating and also saw people distributing communist leaflets. He immediately stepped forward to arrest one person. As he was preparing to take him to the police station, the crowd surged forward, resulting in a conflict with the Chinese patrolman. He immediately opened fire and killed one person. The remaining crowd dispersed. Later, a large number of patrolmen from the police station arrived and arrested four people on Guizhou Road and five people on Ningbo Road. After the incident, the Citizens Training Association, after conducting an investigation, wrote and issued a "Letter to Compatriots." The Third District Party Department also issued a "Letter to Comrades," detailing the causes of the incident.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Freedom Grand Alliance has scheduled a general meeting of representatives from all walks of life to be held at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Tibet Road at 10 a.m. on the 10th of this month to discuss the case of Liu Yiqing's killing yesterday.</p>

<h3>Turning Point for Chinese Steamers on the Yangtze</h3>
<p>Since the summer of last year, Yangtze Chinese steamers have been suspended more often than sailing, resulting in direct and indirect business losses exceeding two million yuan. Recently, after repeated consultations between various shipping companies and the Transportation Department, the suspended steamers were gradually released. Furthermore, a portion of ocean-going vessels was reassigned to replace them, giving hope for the revival of Chinese shipping on the Yangtze River. This matter concerns the continuation and turning point of Chinese navigation on the Yangtze River, and a detailed investigation must be conducted, with the following points noted:</p>
<p>More Ships Resuming Operations: After the return of China Merchants' three major Yangtze steamers, the Jiang'an steamer also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the Jiangjing steamer will also return to Shanghai. Starting this week, classes 1, 4, 3, and 6 can operate as usual. However, the Kuaili, Jiangda, and Jiangtian steamers will be difficult to resume service for the time being. Nevertheless, with seven steamers available, this represents the highest number of ships resuming operations since April of last year. The Zhaoxing Company's Zhaoxing and Yuxing steamers, as well as the Ning Shao Company's Yongxing and Ning Shao steamers, have also fully resumed service. The Sanbei Company has first opened the Xin Ningxing and Minghe steamers, and the Changxing steamer, after repairs, will also soon be sailing. Each week, six to seven Chinese steamers are operating on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Emei Steamer Sailing on the Sichuan River: The recent strike by foreign steamers upstream presents the best opportunity for Chinese ships to compete in business. The Sanbei Company has reassigned the Changsha line's Hongyuan and Hongheng steamers to operate on the Yihan route. The China Merchants Bureau's Emei steamer, which was under repair in Shanghai, has reportedly been completed by the Jiangnan Shipyard and will undergo trial runs immediately. It is scheduled to travel to Hankou next week to operate on the Yichang line. If the decision on the Yingjiang and Erchao British and Japanese steamers remains unresolved, the Emei steamer will be instructed to operate on the Sichuan River to maintain navigational rights.</p>
<p>Contract for Egg Transport: The export volume of eggs from the Yangtze River is extremely large, with an annual value of over ten million yuan for shipments to Europe, America, and Japan. Traditionally, the majority of the transportation has been handled by Taikoo, Nisshin, and Jardine Matheson steamers. The annual shipping costs for eggs from Datong and Anqing alone amount to 130,000 taels. This year, Chinese shipping companies plan to reclaim the transportation rights for this cargo. Li Yunliang, the Business Section Chief of the China Merchants Bureau, personally went to Datong and other ports to negotiate with egg merchants. As a result, it was agreed that future shipments of Yangtze eggs to Shanghai would be exclusively transported by China Merchants and Sanbei Bureau steamers, with a shipping cost of 9.1 jiao per piece. It is reported that a contract has been signed.</p>
<p>Securing Cargo from Foreign Merchants: British and Japanese steamers on the Yangtze River typically handle the transshipment of goods from their respective countries, giving them a business advantage over Chinese steamers. Now that China Merchants, Sanbei, and others will soon have all their Yangtze steamers back in operation, relying solely on local cargo will limit their business. They must transship foreign goods to develop further. Therefore, Li Yunliang's trip to various ports along the Yangtze River for China Merchants Bureau was also to contact foreign merchants in Hankou and Yichang to negotiate the transshipment of foreign goods to Shanghai. This is currently underway in Hankou. In the future, there will be fierce competition between Chinese and foreign commercial steamers on the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Changes to Insurance Procedures: Because of the potential for military involvement on the Yangtze River, the Shanghai Insurance Association has specifically agreed on two new regulations to notify all shipping bureaus: (1) If a ship is requisitioned or chartered by the government for military transport, the insurer must be notified. In addition to special fees, the original insurance policy will be suspended. If the requisition or charter lasts for more than ten days, the premium will be refunded on a daily basis. Failure to report will be considered a voluntary waiver. (2) These regulations will be implemented from the date of the resolution.</p>
<h3>Chegouqiao Security Corps Disarmed by Bandits</h3>
<p>At 7:30 PM on the 7th of this month, over 20 bandits suddenly arrived at the Wai Chegouqiao outpost of the Second District Security Corps of the county, surrounded it, and opened fire. The corps members were unable to resist and had three rifles and one Mauser pistol seized. Chen Zigui, Chief of the Third Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the alarm, immediately led over ten policemen to the Sunjiatang area, about half a li from Chegouqiao, and engaged the bandits. Both sides exchanged fire for several minutes, after which the bandits fled northeast. Coincidentally, security corps members from Guankou also heard the gunfire and arrived to join the pursuit. The bandits then crossed the river. At that time, a squad leader from the Chegouqiao Security Corps arrived in a state of disarray and, together with Chief Chen and others, inspected the outpost, finding two large pools of blood inside and outside the outpost. It was said that during the disarming, one bandit was wounded by gunfire and carried away by the other bandits.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Minhang Military, Police, and Corps Joint Defense Office</h3>
<p>Due to the Major Robbery in Zhangyan</p>
<p>Minhang has 800 Troops</p>
<p>Since the major robbery in Zhangyan, Minhang, rumors have been rampant. To reassure the public, the First District Police Station in that area sent a letter to the First District of the Water Police Team, inviting the military, police, and corps units of the town to establish a joint defense office. The first meeting was held yesterday, attended by representatives from six organizations, including the First District Headquarters of the Water Police Team, the Detective Division of the Garrison Command, the Anti-Smuggling Camp, the First Public Security Bureau, and the First District Security Corps. Many important cases were discussed. However, due to strict confidentiality, the contents of the discussion are unknown. According to visitors from the town, there are currently over 800 troops stationed there, ensuring security.</p>
<h3>Qi and Hai Counties Planning to Build Two Gunboats</h3>
<p>To be Assigned to the Water Police for Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>Recently, piracy outside Wusong has become increasingly rampant, with coastal areas of Chongqi, Tonghai, and other counties being ravaged. Gentry and merchants from Qi and Hai counties, recognizing the weakness of the water police patrol boats in suppressing bandits, have jointly raised substantial funds to build two armored gunboats. These gunboats will be assigned to the Wusong Fourth District of the Provincial Public Security Water Police for management and deployment, strengthening their forces in hopes of thoroughly eliminating bandits, protecting the people, and safeguarding navigation. Yesterday, Gong Mianqin, the leader of the 17th Team stationed in Chongming, Fourth District, reported the situation to Zhu Bingzheng, the District Chief, who forwarded it to the Jiangsu Provincial Civil Affairs Department for approval and record.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Gradually Falling Slightly</h3>
<p>The Rumor of Temporary Suspension of Trade in Zhabei is Absolutely False</p>
<p>Over 40,000 Shi of Rice Arriving in North and South Markets</p>
<p>According to Wuchen She, rice shipments have been abundant in the past two days, and market prices are gradually falling slightly. Some rice boats are still hoping for high prices to make large profits, while rice merchants and shops, seeing the market easing and supplies abundant, are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach. In addition, due to the abandoned lunar Qingming Festival and continuous rainy days, trading has been sluggish, and the market is in a state of stalemate. Yesterday, there were rumors that the Zhabei rice industry had temporarily suspended trading due to price restrictions by the Social Affairs Bureau, which is absolutely false. However, a few rice merchants are hoping for large profits and refusing to sell, resulting in limited trading. In the South Market, Su Tong Bai Geng rice continued to fall by one jiao, while foreign rice rose by one jiao. The cargo of Songjiang Bo Dao rice sold the day before yesterday has not yet been sold, due to weak buying interest. Over 80 rice boats, estimated at over 10,000 shi, are accumulated on the Pudong side. In the North Market, there are over 300 boats, estimated at 30,000+ shi of rice. If sales improve, it will be sufficient to meet demand.</p>

<h3>Change of Deputy Director of Car Services on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Yuan Shaochang Transferred</p>
<p>Zheng Baozhao Succeeds</p>
<p>Yuan Shaochang, Deputy Director of Car Services of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, has held the position for more than ten years. He has always had an exceptionally harmonious relationship with the employees. When the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai from Zhejiang in previous years, Mr. Yuan personally led the employees of the railway to work day and night, so the transportation at that time became smooth. It is understood that Mr. Yuan received an order from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, transferring him to the position of Director of Car Services on the Pinghan Railway. The vacancy will be filled by Zheng Baozhao, the former Car Service Inspector of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Mr. Yuan is a native of Shangyu, Zhejiang.

The employees of the railway have heard the news and are preparing a grand farewell, which shows the public sentiment towards Mr. Yuan on the railway.</p>
<h3>Great Boom in Shipping Chinese Cocoons to Japan</h3>
<p>According to an investigation yesterday, due to the recent surge in the Sino-Japanese exchange rate, the shipping of Chinese export cocoons to various parts of Japan has been very crowded. Since January of this year, Chinese cocoon imports have exceeded 1,000 bales, which is an unprecedented phenomenon.</p>
<h3>New Information on Chinese Silk Exports</h3>
<p>Shipping Costs to Europe Soar: Since the rise of the "golden" expensive trend, all shipping costs have increased. Shipments to Europe have also increased covertly due to the use of shillings. However, the shipping cost of lake silk to the United Kingdom and France, which has always been calculated in taels, seems to be slightly lower compared to other goods. The British and French shipping companies in Shanghai have specifically consulted and revised the new shipping costs, specifically increasing the price of silk to Europe, rising from 1.6 to 2.5 taels per piece (weighing 112 pounds), which is unprecedented. The high shipping costs have truly broken all historical shipping rate records. From Shanghai to Marseille (France), London (England), Geneva, Naples (Italy), and Suez, the price of white silk per piece has increased from 17.8 taels to 19.45 taels, and the price of yellow silk per piece has increased from 13.8 taels to 20.5 taels. To Lyon, the price of white silk per piece has increased from 20.7 taels to 22.6 taels, and the price of yellow silk per piece has increased from 16.7 taels to 18.25 taels. To Paris, the price of white silk per piece has increased from 27.15 taels to 29.65 taels. To Moscow, the price of white silk per piece has increased from 27.6 taels to 30.15 taels, and the price of yellow silk per piece has increased from 23.6 taels to 25.75 taels. All other ports have also increased by more than 20% of the original amount. All customers have been notified.</p>
<p>Lake Silk Shipments to the United States are Crowded: Since May 1, the US Customs will increase import tariffs. After the telegram arrived in Shanghai, various foreign merchants in Shanghai rushed to ship their ordered goods to the United States in advance. The ships scheduled to arrive in the US before April 30 must carry as much as possible. Therefore, from last week until the Jefferson, Empress of Russia, and other ships exporting tomorrow, Shanghai has loaded over 4,000 bales of lake silk to the United States, worth about 5 million yuan. Other items such as beef leather, egg yolk, egg white, and tung oil are also being shipped in large quantities, so the congestion of shipments to the United States this week is truly exceptional, and all ships are fully loaded.</p>
<h3>Development of National Goods Shipping to the United States</h3>
<p>Value of Over 13.1 Million in Three Months</p>
<p>An Increase of Over 5 Million Yuan Compared to Last Year</p>
<p>According to the announcement of the US Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday, the total value of Shanghai's trade with the United States (i.e., national goods imported into the United States) in the three months from January to March this year was US$13,107,410. The total value for the same period last year was US$12,559,964, an increase of US$547,546. The detailed figures for the export of each item are listed below: animal food products 267,507, non-food products 2,151,586, plant non-food products 495,492, food products 108,775, textiles and their raw materials 9,836,909, wood and paper 7,171, non-metallic minerals 52,653, metals and products 118,042, chemical products 18, 914, miscellaneous goods 50,173.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance's Method for Reducing the Chinese Tea Tax</h3>
<p>Order of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality received Order No. 1251 from the Executive Yuan yesterday, stating: "To inform you, the Municipality previously submitted a report from the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Shanghai Tea Industry Association and the Tea Merchants' Guild had repeatedly submitted opinions and requested instructions on methods for reducing or exempting tea taxes. After the report was forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for review and reply, the Ministry replied, stating: 'This case was previously instructed by your Yuan to be handled. Three types of tax reduction methods were drafted and ordered to the National Tariff Commission for investigation and review, and were first submitted for approval. Now, the Commission has replied, stating that implementing Method A is the most effective way to relieve Chinese tea, but changing to a special consumption tax should be premised on central planning and management.' After detailed discussion by the Ministry, it was believed that while reducing or exempting domestic taxes is a temporary solution for relieving Chinese tea, a unified tax law should be formulated for the entire Chinese tea industry to avoid complications that hinder the development of Chinese tea. While under review, the National Government issued an order that all Lijin taxes nationwide would be abolished from October 10, 1930.' The date of implementation is not far off. How domestic Lijin taxes on the transportation and sale of Chinese tea should be reduced or exempted, how export of Chinese tea should be encouraged, and whether special taxes and consumption taxes should be implemented in tea-producing areas of various provinces will undoubtedly be considered with regard to the situation of merchants, the current state of the domestic tea industry, and the trend of international trade, and a comprehensive plan will be carefully formulated and uniformly managed. However, before the national abolition of Lijin taxes is implemented, the old regulations should continue to be followed to avoid confusion. The opinions on reducing or exempting tea taxes submitted by the Shanghai Tea Industry Association and the Shanghai Tea Merchants' Guild, and the opinions on improving Chinese tea formulated by the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau, are undoubtedly adoptable and should be retained as references for revising the tax regulations.' The aforementioned report is hereby ordered to be forwarded to the Municipality for notification."</p>
<h3>Extension of the Deadline for Company License Verification</h3>
<p>Municipal Government Orders the Bureau to Forward Instructions for Compliance</p>
<p>The Municipal Government issued an order to the Social Affairs and Public Utilities Bureaus yesterday, stating: "To issue an order, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Commercial Order No. 9225 was approved, stating: 'It has been found that the company's application for verification and renewal of its license was previously extended by the Ministry for six months until December 9 of last year. Subsequently, a further three-month extension was approved by the Executive Yuan and filed for record. The Ministry has issued a bulletin and notified the respective bureaus to follow the instructions. Now that the deadline has expired again, there are still many companies that have not applied for verification within the deadline. The previous registration licenses should have been revoked after investigation. However, due to the impact of military transportation, it is inevitable that the actual verification and renewal cannot be completed in time, so it is not appropriate to revoke them immediately. Therefore, a further extension is granted until September 15 of the third year to show consideration. If the application for verification and renewal is not submitted within the deadline, the licenses issued will be declared invalid. The Ministry has submitted the above to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. In addition to the public announcement and separate orders, the respective Municipal Governments are requested to investigate and follow the instructions. Furthermore, companies applying for verification and renewal of their licenses should submit the company's articles of association, the latest list of shareholders, and a list of the names and addresses of directors and supervisors for review, and please forward the notification.' The application for verification and renewal of company licenses has been extended for another three months. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce's notification has previously been forwarded for notification. With the approval of the aforementioned information, in addition to separate orders, the respective bureaus are hereby ordered to acknowledge and forward the instructions for compliance."</p>
<h3>Assistance in Improving Industrial Goods</h3>
<p>Announcement from the Industrial Goods Testing Institute</p>
<p>The China National Products Maintenance Association sent a letter to all members of the National Products Factories yesterday, stating: "We have recently received a letter from the Shanghai Special Municipality Social Affairs Bureau Industrial Goods Testing Institute, stating: 'The decline of our country's industry and commerce is due to many complex reasons, but also because the Chinese people have not fully understood the benefits of science, adhering to outdated methods, producing inferior products, and finding it difficult to compete with imported goods. Regarding the promotion of industrial and commercial scientification in European and American countries, we will not discuss it for now. Even our neighbor, Japan, has made rapid progress in industry and commerce in the past 20 years and has become strong, all by emulating the merits of Europe and America. Currently, there are dozens of industrial research and testing institutions in that country, which solve problems, analyze difficulties, imitate, and improve. On the one hand, it is due to the government's encouragement, but without the manufacturers' knowledge of how to use them, it would be difficult to achieve today's good results. Looking back at our country, although it possesses abundant natural resources, it lacks excellent technology and is subject to economic oppression. The existing factories are closing down every day, and new businesses are as rare as morning stars, which is truly painful to say. In view of this, the Shanghai Municipal Government established the Industrial Testing Institute in its 17-year administrative program, aiming to assist in the improvement of the city's industry and commerce. Any manufacturer in the city who entrusts the Institute with research or testing on technical issues, the Institute is extremely willing to serve. Originally, it was intended to be free of charge, but to avoid unintentional entrustment, a very small handling fee will be charged to show restriction. As for the entrustment of research on improving product or raw material issues, no fees will be charged before the research. The raw materials and supplies required for research can be provided by the entruster or purchased by the Institute. However, a contract must be signed in advance. After the research is successful and effective, the entruster will provide a one-time or annual subsidy to supplement the Institute's funding, so that the Institute's scope can be gradually expanded and its effectiveness can be widespread. This is not only in the interests of both parties. Furthermore, the Institute wants to understand the situation of various industries, so it will send letters to three or four manufacturers every week to discuss in person, so as to understand the technical difficulties of each industry, so as to provide guidance or research and improvement. However, some manufacturers still do not understand the Institute's purpose, and ignore it, neither sending representatives nor responding, which is very regrettable. We have always admired your association as a hub in the business world, and have relied on you to plan for the future of national products in every way. Therefore, we would like to ask your association to widely publicize the Institute's purpose of seeking improvement and development for the city's industry and commerce, so that each manufacturer can understand and utilize it. We hope that you will convey this separately and hope that you will give us your valuable advice.' In light of this, we believe that science is omnipotent, and it is not difficult to test. The progress of goods depends on research and development. The source of wealth and strength lies in this. Now, the Municipal Industrial Goods Testing Institute has made a great vow to serve our country's goods industry and commerce with sincere dedication and determination, which is deeply admired. Moreover, our country's goods manufacturers often lament that they lack the financial resources to conduct research to improve their products and expand sales. Now, there are specialized talents who are willing to do their best, which is what our country's goods industry has been seeking but has not been able to obtain. It is fortunate. Our association sincerely hopes that our manufacturers will develop a close relationship with the Institute and entrust research and improvement with sincerity, so that not only will the factory benefit infinitely, but it will also be the glory of our country's goods industry. This is a special announcement, and we hope that you will investigate and adopt it."</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Reduction of Postal Rates for Overseas Chinese Letters</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications yesterday, stating: "To the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing: On the Geng Day, the Overseas Chinese Congress in Singapore sent a telegram stating: 'To the Shanghai National Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Overseas Chinese Federation: Your association has worked hard to argue for the increased fees for overseas Chinese letters, and all overseas Chinese are grateful. The Singapore general packing method is still followed. The Civil Affairs Bureau is allowed to pack and send the envelopes and affix the total number of stamps outside the package. The number of envelopes is checked against the book, and missing stamps will be punished. This is truly convenient for the people. The Ministry of Communications' Winter Telegram has approved a reduction of 5 cents, and the Shantou, Xiamen, and Shaoxing Bureaus have been ordered to affix the stamps to each envelope before packing, and they also want to change to a special postal agent name. We have telegraphed the Ministry to earnestly order them to follow the old method and not to impose harsh examples on the people. Your association loves and protects overseas Chinese. Please help us.' From Lin Jindian, Singapore Overseas Chinese Congress, and others. The old regulations of packing and sending the envelopes themselves, affixing the total number of stamps outside the package, and checking the number of envelopes against the book, with punishment for missing stamps, are truly convenient for the people. The UK is following the old method, but the Shantou and Xiamen postal bureaus are changing the old regulations, ordering that the stamps be affixed to each envelope before packing, which is time-consuming and inconvenient. We should request a quick telegram to the Shantou and Xiamen postal bureaus to follow the old method. The Civil Affairs Bureau is changing to a special postal agent, but there is no such method in Southeast Asia, and there is no suspicion of violating the Postal Union Convention. Our country does not need to do this, or wait until the Southeast Asian countries implement it before imitating it. We ask for prompt approval and hope for a telegraphic reply.' The National Chamber of Commerce Federation, the Overseas Chinese Federation, etc. Qiyin. In addition, the National Federation of Commerce and the Overseas Chinese Federation have been working hard to argue with the government for the increased postal rates for overseas Chinese letters. Yesterday, the Overseas Chinese Federation received a letter and telegram from the Chaozhou Eight County Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong and the Chaozhou Beijing Students Association, reporting that the association and other local organizations have joined forces to assist in the case and have sent numerous telegrams to the government to argue for the case, requesting that the old method be followed. The Overseas Chinese Federation immediately replied with thanks and detailed the process of the case and the recent situation."</p>

It is now known that the Ministry of Justice's order to appoint Shen Bing-lian as the President of the District Court has been issued. However, Shen himself has not yet received the letter of appointment, so he has not been able to take office temporarily.

Director Wu reported the situation to the provincial and county governments for instructions. The county government received instructions from the Jiangsu Construction Department, stating that they should still follow the rules and strictly order the ferry companies to collect the fees by a deadline and not allow them to delay on any pretext. Director Wu immediately ordered the county construction bureau to comply. Yesterday, Director Wu ordered each ferry company to submit the river management fees due from January to March of the 19th year to the bureau within five days of receiving the order, and not to delay any further.</p>
<h3>Seven Labor Unions Issue Declaration Regarding Foreign Soldiers' Assault</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Newspaper Workers' Union, Commercial Press Workers' Union, Postal Workers' Union, Commercial Press General Affairs Department Workers' Union, British American Tobacco Factory Workers' Union, China Merchants Bureau Pier Five Workers' Union, and Commercial Press Translation Department Workers' Union issued a declaration in support of the Commercial Press workers' struggle against the French sailors' assault: "On April 2nd, newspapers reported that the Commercial Press Distribution Office Workers' Union issued a letter to all sectors of society regarding the French sailors' willful assault and harm to our compatriots. After reading it, we are filled with anger. Our compatriots have been humiliated and suffered under the iron heels of imperialism, and they have been cruelly killed. Recently, it has intensified, and innocent people have been killed, even up to three people. It is truly difficult to even walk on the road. Their arrogance is due to the concessions serving as a protective talisman and extraterritoriality serving as a guarantee. Therefore, if the concessions are not recovered and extraterritoriality is not abolished, hoping to avoid such tragedies is like climbing a tree to catch fish, which is impossible. The Commercial Press Distribution Office Workers' Union has put forward two proposals, fundamental and symptomatic, to safeguard national sovereignty and protect the human rights of our compatriots. The survival of the nation is at stake. We sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will rise up and fight for justice. Our unions pledge to be your backing and will not hesitate to go through fire and water. This is our declaration."</p>

<h3>Overview of the Work of the Drug Workers' Support Association</h3>
<p>Since the start of the work of the various labor unions in the Drug Workers' Support Association, the various labor unions have been enthusiastically contacting and assisting the drug workers, and sending representatives to comfort them. Since the strike began, almost a month has passed. Although they are suffering from hunger and cold, their attitude of indignation has not diminished. They are determined not to resume work until their goal is achieved. The fundraising team sent by the support association, in addition to going to Zhabei, Nanshi, Pudong and other places to solicit donations from various labor unions, also worked with the propaganda and communication departments to give speeches to various labor unions about the negotiation process between the drug industry labor and management, and they all helped generously.

<h3>Report on Disaster Relief in Baoying from Jisheng Association</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association received a telegram from Liu Shu-lun, the Director of Disaster Relief in Baoying, Jiangsu, stating that Baoying has suffered from locusts and drought for many years, but the disaster last year was even more severe. A total of more than 40 villages in the entire territory have been selected to investigate the southeastern and northeastern regions with the most serious disasters, a total of 16 large villages, each with about 70 villages attached to it. This is the most severely affected area. The disaster victims are all using wild grass and bark to fill their stomachs, and some are even starving to death. The situation is truly unbearable to witness. They escaped in winter and returned in spring, but the farmers have no food to eat, no seeds to plant, and no strength to cultivate. The suffering is especially severe. Our chairman and the gentlemen are kind and compassionate, with the aim of saving people and thoroughly helping them. Shu-lun respectfully followed the strict investigation and heavy release, removing the households with minor disasters. However, there are too many serious disasters, and it is impossible to remove them all. The spring relief this year is widespread and the funds are low, which is useless. We can only ask for additional funds in order to evenly distribute the kindness and avoid omissions. The association previously remitted 20,000 yuan of disaster relief funds from Zikang Village, and there are still 4,000 bags of relief flour to be shipped to the area.</p>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Pays Attention to Refugees Passing Through</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau issued an order to all district offices yesterday, stating that the city has convenient transportation. Based on the number of refugees passing through the city last year, there were more than 6,000 people. Now that the busy farming season is coming, there will be quite a few returning to their hometowns to farm. We are deeply concerned that unscrupulous people will pretend to be refugees and try to disturb the local area. It is not enough to eliminate hidden dangers without strict prevention at all times. In addition to the separate orders, the order is to instruct the heads of each district office to follow the instructions, order their subordinates to pay attention at all times, and when refugees pass through, in addition to taking care of and suppressing them, they should also carefully monitor them. If there are people with suspicious behavior, they should immediately report them for verification and handling. This order.</p>

<h3>When Will the China Merchants Bureau Dispute End?</h3>
<p>Li Gu-fan Sues Li Guo-jie Again</p>
<p>Raises Four Points of Accusation</p>
<p>Recently, lawsuits involving the China Merchants Bureau have emerged one after another. First, there was the criminal mutual accusation between Zhao Tie-qiao, the General Manager of the bureau, and Li Guo-jie, the Chairman of the board of directors and Manager of the Jiyu Company. Then, Zhao, the General Manager, appointed Fu Ju-cun, the Manager of the Jiyu Company, to sue Li Guo-jie for refusing to hand over the managerial position. Now, Li Gu-fan, a shareholder of the bureau, has sued Li Guo-jie and Ou Tang-rong for illegally holding a meeting. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shang-qing of the Special District Court opened a trial. First, the plaintiff stated the reasons (1) At the meeting held on February 22nd and 23rd of this year, the shareholders present did not reach more than half of the total number of shareholders. The company has more than 40,000 shares, and only 15,000 shares were present on that day. (2) The restriction on equity violates the Company Law. (3) The Jiyu Company is an agency of the China Merchants Bureau. The shareholders' meeting of the Jiyu Company should be convened by the China Merchants Bureau. It is illegal to convene it by the Jiyu Company. (4) The registration of the Jiyu Company is illegal. Based on the above reasons, I filed the lawsuit. Then, Li's lawyer added that the China Merchants Bureau and the Jiyu Company are closely related. The property of the China Merchants Bureau is managed by the Jiyu Company. If the two are separated, the collateral on which the bureau relies to borrow money will be gone. Neither of the defendants was present, and their representative lawyers replied that the four reasons stated by the plaintiff were as follows: (1) Although the number of people present at the meeting was not enough for the quorum, all the resolutions complied with the company's regulations. They were treated as provisional resolutions and passed at the second meeting before becoming resolutions. However, due to the lawsuit, the meeting has not yet been held. (2) The regulations on the shareholding system are in accordance with the Company Law. (3) The Jiyu Company applied to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for registration in February of the 18th year and was approved and issued a license. It can be separated from the China Merchants Bureau. (4) The registration is of course legal. As for the plaintiff's lawyer saying that the China Merchants Bureau must rely on the company, it is also inaccurate. The capital of the China Merchants Bureau is 8 million yuan, and although the debt is 14 million yuan, its assets are still worth 40 million yuan. How can it lead to bankruptcy? Judge Cheng stated that it is questionable whether this case should be resolved by the administrative organ or handled by the judicial office. He should wait for consideration and handling, and then adjourn the hearing to another date.</p>
<h3>Famous Jockey Entrusts Lawyer for Divorce While Far Away in England</h3>
<p>Lawyer States Divorce Request is Extremely Firm</p>
<p>Vows Not to Return Home Until Goal is Achieved</p>
<p>Ms. Fang Also Did Not Appear in Court Yesterday</p>
<p>Official Urges Both Parties to Reconcile</p>
<p>Ms. Fang Wen-xian, the sister of wealthy businessman Fang Jiao-bo, has been married to the famous jockey Hu Hui-lin for 16 years. After Hu fell in love with Mina, the eldest daughter of illusionist Lang De-shan, he disregarded his children and abandoned his wife. Recently, he hired a lawyer to file for divorce from his wife, as reported in the previous newspaper. The case was tried by Judge Cheng Shang-feng of the Special District Court at 2:30 PM yesterday. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared in person, and each appointed a lawyer to represent them. First, the plaintiff's lawyer said that Hu Hui-lin is now in London, England, so he could not appear in court. He and Ms. Fang have been married for more than ten years and have seven children, but their relationship has not been harmonious and they often quarreled while living together. Hu is skilled in horse riding and has won many awards. These awards are obtained in exchange for Hu's reputation, which cannot be obtained with money. His wife sold these awards, which Hu was most saddened by. Therefore, this time he requested a divorce extremely firmly. Hu once said that if he cannot achieve the goal of divorce, he will vow not to return home. The defendant's lawyer also said that the defendant, Fang Wen-xian, knew that her husband was named Hu Hui-lin and was now in the United States. Now reading the complaint, it is written as Hu Hui-lin, and the plaintiff's lawyer also said that he is now in England. It is still questionable whether this person is the defendant's husband. Since he is in England, why is the cross in the complaint signed by the plaintiff himself? It is difficult to explain. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately replied that the plaintiff's name is an English name, and Hui and Hui are translated incorrectly. The cross in the complaint was signed by our lawyer. Under the debate between the lawyers of both sides, Judge Cheng instructed the lawyers of both sides to go out and inform the parties to reconcile, so as to avoid litigation. The lawyers then retreated.</p>
<h3>Unmarried Woman Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>The Case is Quite Bizarre</p>
<p>The Deceased Was Shot in the Forehead</p>
<p>Said to Have Been Playing with a Gun</p>
<p>The Court Will Examine Today</p>
<p>Zhang Tian-xing, a Suzhou native living at No. 22 Delan Roomfang, Shipinoung, in the city, was engaged to Wang Xiao-mei, and their marriage was approaching. Unexpectedly, an accident occurred yesterday morning, and the unmarried woman died unjustly, which is also a painful event in life. However, as the matter is extraordinary, there are many disputes, and the court is scheduled to examine the case this morning. How did it happen? The truth will be revealed soon. The incident occurred before noon yesterday. After the public security bureau of the first office of the second district heard the news, the director and patrol officers went to investigate. They learned that Zhang Tian-xing was wiping the pistol he was wearing in the pavilion room on the second floor around 11:30 AM yesterday, facing the window and facing away from the door. Zhang said that after he finished wiping, he was afraid that the bullets in the gun clip would cause a mistake when using it, so he inserted the magazine to try to pull it. Who knew that his unmarried woman, Wang Xiao-mei, suddenly came to his side and pulled him, accidentally touching the firing pin, and the bullet flew out, hitting her forehead. She fell to the ground at that time and died before she could be treated. The police investigation revealed that there were six bullets remaining in the clip. The gun was a Browning type, with words such as "Hu Shu Yi Si Qi Jiu" on it. The deceased was 24 years old and was the sister of Wang Pin-xiang from Nanxiang. After the engagement, the relationship was still good. She came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and lived in Zhang Tian-xing's house. They were going to be married on the 24th of this month. After the deceased was shot, she was lying on the ground, and the situation was extremely tragic. The bullet entered from the brow and remained in her head, causing a bulge in the back of her head. According to Zhang, his brother Jin-fu was writing in the room when the accident occurred. The layout of the room where the accident occurred is roughly as follows: a table is placed on the right side of the window, and the bed is on the left side. The door to enter and exit is opposite the bed. Zhang's brother opened Zhang Hexing Paint Shop, and the downstairs of his residence is rented as a clothing store. It is said that the deceased Wang Xiao-mei came from downstairs after seeing the wedding clothes before the accident. Alas.</p>
<h3>Luo Huizhu Follows Her Lover Underground</h3>
<p>Medical Treatment Was Ineffective and She Died</p>
<p>The Poor Old Mother Spurted Blood Upon Hearing the News</p>
<p>Cantonese prostitute Luo Huizhu and her fellow villager Guo Jinhua were deeply in love and vowed to marry each other. Unexpectedly, Guo was short of money and had no resources to marry Luo. Not wanting to be separated, they went to Room 472 of the Dongya Hotel on Nanjing Road on the 24th of last month and each drank poison in order to die together. Guo took more poison and died at that time. Luo was still curable and was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. After this matter was reported in the newspapers, it became a topic of discussion and aroused all kinds of speculation, thinking that if Luo prostitute could be cured in the future, whether she could jump out of the bad environment and no longer enter Pingkang, which would be enough to comfort Guo Lang in the afterlife. If she is still a willow wall flower and allowed to be plucked by others, then Guo's sacrifice is particularly worthless. Now, Luo prostitute has also passed away. Not only can this kind of argument be eliminated, but Luo prostitute's martyrdom must have been out of her nature. Since the prostitute entered the hospital, she believed that her lover had died for her, so why could she live alone? She also had the determination to die, and the medical treatment was ineffective, and the condition worsened day by day. It was not until 4:00 PM the day before yesterday that she stopped breathing. The hospital notified the Zhabei police station and sent detectives to the scene to carry the remains to the forensic station on Faelun Road. They immediately went to the Cantonese brothel at No. 209 Ren Zhili, North Sichuan Road, to notify the deceased's mother to go to the forensic station the next day to collect the body. Luo's mother was grief-stricken at the loss of her pearl and began to cry. Then, she spurted blood. When Prosecutor Dun Wei of the Special District Court arrived at the forensic station yesterday afternoon to examine the body, the body's mother could not appear in court. Luo Feng-sheng, the uncle of the body, represented the case, explained the ins and outs, and requested permission to sign and collect the body for burial on her behalf. Prosecutor Guo, after examining that Luo Huizhu was indeed poisoned by Lysol solution before her death, ordered Luo Feng-sheng to collect the body for burial. Thus, the tragic ending of this pair of ill-fated lovers was concluded.</p>
<h3>Chinese Medicine Practitioner Liu Siqiao Died Tragically After Being Hit by a Car</h3>
<p>Chinese medicine practitioner Liu Siqiao, whose clinic was located at No. 97 Pinglili, Jiujiang Road, recently authored a medical book and commissioned Huafeng Printing House on Lincoln Road to print it. Yesterday morning, Liu went to the printing house to urge them to publish it as soon as possible so that it could be published soon. Then, he hired a rickshaw to return to the clinic. When he passed Daxi Road, he was suddenly hit and injured by a car driven by the driver Pan Shiju, and he died immediately. The nearby patrolmen heard the police and carried the body to the forensic station on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court commissioned Prosecutor Guo to examine the body, and the wife of the deceased, Li Caiyun, filed a statement, saying that she would resort to the law to vindicate her husband. Prosecutor Guo briefly interrogated the driver Pan Shiju and ordered Pan to pay a deposit of 1,000 yuan and wait for the relatives of the deceased to file a lawsuit.</p>

<h3>News Regarding the Sale of the Mao Ye Bank Building</h3>
<p>Unable to Reimburse Ordinary Creditors</p>
<p>The Evening News reports: The address of the Nanjing Road branch of China Mao Ye Bank was actually sold to Puyi Real Estate Company for 577,500 taels, not 600,000 taels as previously rumored. However, these funds cannot be used to repay ordinary creditors, because the property, as well as the bank branches in Beiping (Beijing) and Tianjin, were previously mortgaged to the Shanghai Chinese Bankers' Group. Therefore, the group has priority rights. It is said that Puyi Company intends to use the purchased property for its own purposes and will move in along with Puyi Bank.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Length of Roads for Automobiles in This City</h3>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Punishes Well-Drilling Company for Illegal Business Operations</h3>
<p>The Tianhe Well Drilling Company on Bubbling Well Road in this city has not registered with the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and is operating without a license. Inspectors from the bureau have repeatedly verbally instructed them to comply with regulations, but the company has ignored them. On April 4th, the inspector visited again and found that the company had neither registered nor ceased operations. The female head of the company, Ms. Yin Li, and Chen Jianyuan were taken to the Sixth District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau for detention. The bureau, citing their unauthorized operation in the city without a license, violating the city's water supply regulations, sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to punish them according to regulations. If the company is willing to operate in the city after paying the fine, it will also be ordered to pay a deposit, which will be refunded after it registers with the Bureau of Public Utilities.</p>
<h3>Recently Planned Routes by the Municipal Bureau of Public Works</h3>
<p>For practical needs, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works has specially planned a section from the Fahua District connecting Xinzha Road to the Bubbling Well Road in the Public Concession, with a proposed width of 18.3 meters.

It is reported that the above routes have been approved by the Municipal Council and by the Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>The Engineering Society Holds a Farewell Dinner for Huang Boqiao and Others</h3>
<p>On the 7th of this month at 7 PM, the Chinese Engineering Society held a public farewell dinner for Huang Boqiao, Wang Shengshen, and Wu Jian (Mr. Wu is still in Hankou), representatives attending the Second World Power Conference in Berlin. Guests included Zhu Kezhen, President of the Science Society of China, Chen Guojun, Deputy Secretary-General of the China Construction Association, Yang Junsheng, representative of the Chinese Society for the Advancement of Learning, and Li Yanshi, who is attending the Power Conference independently. Members present included Xu Peihuang, Guo Chengen, Shen Yi, Xue Cixin, Li Keng, Wang Bailei, Li Chu, Yang Xiliu, Huang Bingkui, Wang Xingxin, Zhu Shuyi, Tan Boyu, and over sixty others. The chairman, Hu Shuhua, presided. During the dinner, Chairman Hu rose and gave a speech, stating that considering the size of China, it was regrettable that only three or four people were attending the Second World Power Conference, which was less than other countries. However, no one from China participated in the First Power Conference held in London in 1924. Although the number is small this time, the quality is excellent. Germany has recovered since the European War and its industrial progress is particularly remarkable. Moreover, its political aspect no longer has the color of imperialism. Industrial talents are especially willing to connect with our country. With these conveniences, it is certain that each representative will return with great contributions to the motherland after the conference. Zhu Kezhen, Chen Guojun, Yang Junsheng, and others then delivered farewell speeches, offering much encouragement. Xue Cixin, Vice President of the Shanghai Branch, and members Guo Chengen, Tan Boyu, and others also spoke. Mr. Huang Boqiao and Mr. Li Jiashi gave speeches in reply. Mr. Huang also said that this time, our country's attendance was small, the funding was insufficient, and there was no contribution in terms of power, deeply regretting the unimpressive appearance. Mr. Hu then stated that the material civilization of Europe and America was comparable to that of our country before James Watt completed the steam engine, which was only about one hundred and seventy years ago. If we strive to be strong, who knows whether we will not rival Europe and America in a hundred years? He asked Mr. Huang not to be discouraged and raised a glass to wish him a smooth journey. The gathering ended in joy at 10 PM.</p>
<h3>The Case of the American Ship Crashing into a Stone Boat</h3>
<p>Refusing to Pay Compensation</p>
<p>The American merchant ship *Voluntian*, belonging to Foreland Company, recently arrived in Shanghai from the United States carrying cargo. While sailing on the Huangpu River in front of the Tongxing Cotton Mill, it collided with the *Jin Jia Zhen*, a stone-carrying boat which failed to give way in time. The *Jin Jia Zhen* was broken in two by the collision. Fortunately, no one was injured. Afterwards, the ship owner, along with the Stone Guild and the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, negotiated with the company for compensation. Foreland Company hired an appraiser, Maiton, to investigate the accident site. It is now reported that one section of the sunken boat was stolen, and the other section is still on the river surface. The investigation concluded that the American ship was sailing on its designated route and made no mistake, making it difficult to assign responsibility for compensation. A letter of attestation was also obtained from the captain of a certain warship stationed there. Yesterday, this decision was communicated in a letter to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, expressing their refusal to pay compensation.</p>
<h3>A Husband Repeatedly Forces His Wife into Prostitution</h3>
<p>And Accuses Someone of Abducting His Wife</p>
<p>Wang Dagen from Jingjiang, 39 years old, and his wife, Ms. Lu, 31 years old, have a son and a daughter. The son, named Heshang, is currently 12 years old, and the daughter, Xiaoyatou, is 10 years old. The relationship between Wang and his wife was generally good. Wang ran a bathhouse in his hometown, and the business was doing well. However, he was naturally lazy and neglected the business, which led to the bathhouse closing down within a few years. He then brought his family to Shanghai to seek a livelihood. However, after several months, he could not find any job. He was forced to lodge in a small inn in the French Concession and force his wife into prostitution every night, and he would go out to solicit customers. Due to livelihood reasons, Ms. Lu had no choice but to comply. The money earned each night, after expenses, was all used by Wang. There was a Jiangbei boatman named Zhang Zhuangsheng, who was over fifty years old and still frequented brothels. Last winter, he met Ms. Lu. After learning about her situation, he felt pity for her and discussed the matter with Wang, offering to cover the daily expenses for Ms. Lu and her children, and instructing Wang to find another job. Wang agreed. So Zhang rented a house at No. 17, Xingju Lane, Xin Street, Nanshi, and lived with Ms. Lu and her children as if they were husband and wife. This has been going on for over six years. Wang, besides eating meals at Zhang's place every day, wanted to borrow money to spend lavishly, which caused Zhang a lot of trouble. Recently, Wang, because the money given to him was less than before, decided to send Ms. Lu back to Beishi to work as a prostitute. Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, he rushed to Zhang's place and forced Ms. Lu to go with him. Ms. Lu refused to return to her old profession and firmly resisted. Wang then went to the First Precinct, First Sub-precinct to report that Zhang had enticed and hidden his wife, requesting an investigation. The chief immediately sent police officers Liu Lianrun and others to the house. Zhang was not there, so they took Ms. Lu back for a preliminary hearing. Ms. Lu confessed, "The reason why I am willing to live with an old man over fifty years old instead of with my young husband is for the sake of my own and my children's livelihood. Now my husband wants me to go with him, but he can hardly support himself, how can he support his wife and children? If I am forced to sell myself again, I really do not want to." She begged for understanding. The chief, finding the allegations to be inconsistent, ordered a written statement to be prepared and transferred to the Shanghai District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>In the Case of Accusation of Hiding a Daughter, the Daughter Also Requests to End the Mother-Daughter Relationship</h3>
<p>Already Married to He Yueqi</p>
<p>Does Not Wish to Return with Her Mother</p>
<p>Yang Shannan was accused by Suzhou woman Wu He of hiding her daughter. Yesterday afternoon, Zhou, a judge of the Special District Court, convened a hearing. According to the plaintiff, her daughter, Cui Bao, 20 years old, was pawned by her husband five years ago to the defendant's brothel to work as a servant. At that time, she was in Beiping. Later, she learned that her daughter had been lured into prostitution and had given birth to two children. After coming to Shanghai, she negotiated with the defendant to take her back, but the defendant hid Cui Bao. Therefore, she is suing, asking the court to order the return of her daughter and to pay her 4,000 yuan as child support for her daughter's two children. According to the defendant's statement, Cui Bao was pawned to my brothel, and she gave birth to children with customers of her own free will. Later, Cui Bao hired a lawyer to dissolve the relationship with me, and she left with the lawyer. I do not know her whereabouts. Wu Cui Bao also hired a lawyer to participate in the case, requesting permission to end the mother-daughter relationship with Wu He. According to Cui Bao's statement, "I entered the brothel because my mother pawned me. Later, I shaved my head and gave birth to children of my own free will. It was not forced by the defendant. Now I am married to He Yueqi and will not return with my mother." After the lawyers for both parties presented their arguments, Judge Zhou declared the debate closed and scheduled a date for the verdict.</p>
<h3>The Woman at the Scene of the Lunatic's Murder Case Was Summoned Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the case of the lunatic Zhang Jiazhen killing a woman and a child on Zhonghua Road in Xiaonanmen, Yang, the investigating officer of the District Court, summoned He Jiumei, the woman who was nearly killed at the time, to the case for questioning yesterday. According to her statement, she is 21 years old and lives in Xiaonanmen. At 1 PM at the end of last month, she and the deceased Wu Zhou went to work at a sock factory. While walking to the entrance of Tianfu Lane on Zhonghua Road, she didn't know where the lunatic came from. Later, she saw the deceased rush forward, and when she turned her head, she saw the murderer holding a knife, and had already stabbed Wu Zhou's head and neck. Surprised, she asked what was happening, and then the murderer grabbed me. I struggled and escaped and haven't dared to go out since. I didn't know what happened afterwards, but we didn't know the murderer at all. The officer ordered her to return home and wait for further instructions.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Ambushed in the Dark</h3>
<p>Three Thugs Arrive Suddenly</p>
<p>The Rickshaw Puller's Life is in Grave Danger</p>
<p>At around 8:45 PM last night, Xu Xiaozhang, a former rickshaw puller, was walking along Tangshan Road on Yunli Lane in Hongkou. Three people wearing blue cloth shirts and pants suddenly emerged from the darkness. Without any explanation, they produced a handgun and fired three shots at Xu's head, two shots at his right leg, and one shot at his left hand. Blood gushed out, and he fell to the ground. The assailants disappeared without a trace. A Western police officer, number 107, from the Wayside Police Station, patrolling the area, sent the injured rickshaw puller to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, Xu was unable to speak when he arrived at the hospital and died several minutes later.</p>
<h3>A Monk Does Not Abide by Monastic Rules</h3>
<p>Spending a Night Out</p>
<p>Resulting in Three Days of Detention</p>
<p>Yuanzhao, a monk residing at Longhua Temple, recently discovered that his disciple Guangwen did not abide by the rules and spent the night outside. After repeated warnings failed, he handed Guangwen over to the Sixth District, Third Precinct. Chief Liu briefly questioned him. Guangwen stated that his Dharma name was Guangwen, he was from Shandong, and was 24 years old. He had been a monk since he was young. The previous day, a fellow villager visited him, and they went to see a play in Shanghai. It was inconvenient to return at night, so he stayed overnight in a hotel. He returned the next day and there was no misconduct. Chief Liu ordered the monk to be detained for three days as a warning for unauthorized absence and disobedience to his teacher.</p>
<h3>Another Woman Arrested in the Case of the Four Banks' Reserve Robbery</h3>
<p>Accused of Relaying Stolen Money for the Bandits</p>
<p>Several bandits involved in the armed robbery of the Four Banks' Reserve have been successively arrested by the police. The day before yesterday, detectives from the Municipal Public Security Bureau also arrested Zhao Wang, a woman from Suzhou, at No. 1, Qinglian Road, Nanshi, who was related to the case. The Zhabei Police Station learned of this and transferred Zhao Wang back to their station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Special District Court for questioning. According to Detective Liang Chengyu, Zhao Wang confessed to the Public Security Bureau that she had relayed stolen money from Yuan Genfa to a certain woman. Judge Zhou questioned her briefly and ordered the defendant to be detained, with the case to be tried jointly with the other defendants at a later date.</p>
<h3>False Receipts Used to Collect Match Account Payments</h3>
<p>Is It Acceptable to Do It Again?</p>
<p>Caught After Second Attempt</p>
<p>The Lao Shen Da Tobacco and Paper Shop in Zhongshi Town, Caojiadu, Huxi, has been open for many years and its business is quite prosperous. It sells matches and purchases them from the Baochang Match Company on Pingjili Road in the French Concession. Payments are made regularly on settlement days. However, last month, Fei Jiqing, an employee of the Huichang Company, an agency of the match company, fabricated a receipt from the match company and forged a letter of authorization (the letter stated that the match company had authorized him to collect payment). He went to the Shen Da Shop to collect payment. The shop believed it was genuine and paid the amount of over one hundred and ten yuan in full. Later, the shop purchased two more cases of matches from the company, but neither side mentioned the previous payment. On the 5th of this month, Fei Jiqing again used a false receipt to collect payment for one case of matches. The shop stated that they had purchased two cases, so why was he only collecting payment for one case? Fei immediately said that it must have been a mistake by the accountant and promised to check and return later. The wheels of justice turn slowly, but grind finely. The next day (the 6th), Du Shaoquan, a salesman from the match company, arrived at the shop with a formal receipt to collect both new and old accounts. The shop then realized that Fei had fraudulently collected the payment and told Du about the situation. On the afternoon of the 7th, Fei still dared to go to the shop with a false receipt for two cases of matches and demanded payment. The shop stallled him and immediately reported it to the match company by telephone. The match company sent representatives who stated that they had verified that Fei had fraudulently collected over one thousand yuan from various places. They took Fei Jiqing, along with the forged letter and receipts, to the headquarters of the Fourth Team of the Thirteenth Branch of the Songhu Security Group in the town. The team sent a letter to the Sixth District Police Station for investigation. Fei Jiqing confessed that he was 27 years old, a local, and worked at the Huichang Company, admitting that he had fraudulently collected payment from the shop. The manager of the Huichang Company also surrendered himself, requesting that Fei be punished according to the law. Yesterday, a document was prepared and sent to the District Court for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Fourth District Detective Team Cracks a Robbery and Murder Case</h3>
<p>Leading to the Resolution of Multiple Cases</p>
<p>The Detective Team of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei recently solved a robbery and murder case, along with cracking the case of a patrolman being killed in the Public Concession and other theft cases. In investigating the robbery and murder case at the Jufeng Charcoal Shop on Xiexu Road, on the 4th, they received a tip that Chen Bilu, a known bandit, was involved in the case and was hiding at No. 719, Xiejiayu Lane, Ximalu, Jing'an Temple Road. Led by Public Security Officer Liu Shaoda and Detective Shi Yunling of the Detective Team of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau, they went to the address along with detectives from the patrol force. Chen Bilu was not at home, but three handguns, thirty bullets, a Mauser pistol, and eight bullets were found in the bed. Chen's wife, Cao, was also taken to the police station. Later, according to a tip, the fugitive Gu Cailin had enticed a young woman and was hiding in Room 25 of a certain hotel in the concession. Officer Xia led detectives to arrest Chen. He confessed to robbing the charcoal shop on Xiexu Road with Wang Dalu, Lu Ancheng, and Xu Liu. Wang Dalu shot and killed a man outside the door. They also repeatedly robbed the Shixing Guild Hall in Nanshi and a Wang family's house in Che Yang Fangzi Lane. However, regarding the shooting of the patrolman behind the Yong'an Cotton Mill in the Public Concession, he said that he was not involved. When the detectives were searching Chen Bilu's house, they sent detectives to guard it and subsequently arrested the bandits Yu Jinshan, Dai Lixuan, and Li Desheng. They confessed to robbing the Tianfuli on Meiyuan Road, the Gujiawan Glass Factory, the north side of the railroad's Caozha, and a thatched shed at the end of Datong Road with others.

<h3>Briton Fined for Traffic Violation</h3>
<p>Jeffcott Fined Five Pounds</p>
<p>The *Wenhui Bao* reports that Jeffcott, a British chemical assistant at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, drove his car drunk on the afternoon of March 29th, driving erratically on Sichuan Road. Later, at the corner of Ningbo Road, he overturned a rickshaw. He ignored the order of the Chinese police to stop and drove into Ningbo Road, hitting a small car. Near Tianjin, the Chinese police, with the help of an Indian police officer, finally dragged Jeffcott out of the car and sent him to the General Police Station by rickshaw.

The presiding officer Anderson fined him five British pounds, equivalent to seventy-three yuan and eight jiao in Shanghai silver currency, and gave him a warning, saying that he was lucky that he did not cause a major disaster that day, otherwise, the fine would not have been the only punishment.</p>

<h3>Anti-Opium Society Releases Shocking Statistics</h3>
<p>Over Fourteen Million Taels of Persian Opium Exported Last Year</p>
<p>The International Section and Investigation Section of the China National Anti-Opium Society recently conducted a detailed investigation into the import of Persian opium (commonly known as red soil) into China, which has poisoned society and caused endless harm. According to their statistics, from December 17th to the end of November 18th, over four hundred and eleven tons of opium were shipped from the two ports of Bosseia and Mohammilla in Persia, totaling fourteen million seven hundred and thirty thousand two hundred and forty taels. The exports by country are approximately as follows: (Russia) Vladivostok, 2,320 boxes, 5,551,680 taels; (UK) Singapore, 2,079 boxes, 4,677,120 taels; (China) Dalian, 764 boxes, 1,953,280 taels; (Portugal) Macau, 400 boxes, 1,021,440 taels; (Japan) Keelung, 350 boxes, 809,600 taels; (Germany) Hamburg, 240 boxes, 624,800 taels; (Siam) Bangkok, 200 boxes, 448,000 taels; (Netherlands) Batavia, 100 boxes, 258,800 taels; (USA) New York, 70 boxes, 117,120 taels; (UK) Sandakan, 50 boxes, 197,120 taels. The total export amount reached 6,573 boxes. Among them, 4,063 boxes were exported by British ships, 1,908 boxes were exported by Chinese ships, 412 boxes were exported by Japanese ships, and 190 boxes were exported by German ships. The 2,320 boxes exported from Persia to Vladivostok were actually never arrived at the port. They were completely smuggled into China and the bulk was smuggled into Shanghai and sold to various places. In addition, the Persian opium imported from Batavia, Singapore, Dalian, Keelung, Macau, Sandakan, and Bangkok is entirely used by the local colonial governments to poison our overseas Chinese. The numbers exported to New York and Hamburg are for the manufacture of narcotic drugs.</p>
<p>The above opium, calculated at the Shanghai opium market price, is worth about 60 million yuan. Our people are impoverished and exhausted, and yet they bear this additional burden to buy poisons that harm their bodies and exterminate their race. Is this not a great calamity for our country? It is hoped that the people of the country will rise up together to reject opium and eliminate this poison that destroys the country and exterminates our race.</p>
<h3>Selecting Locations for Public Housing</h3>
<p>The *New Shanghai News* reports that the number of shanties in Shanghai, according to the Public Security Bureau's statistics from 1928, is approximately 10,975 households in Nanshi, 2,336 households in Huxi, and 415 households in Wusong. However, there has been an inevitable increase in the past year, and the total number should be in the tens of thousands of households. As a result, whenever a fire occurs, dozens of families are burned, and their hunger and suffering are truly miserable. Therefore, the construction of public housing is a matter of utmost urgency. Recognizing this, the Municipal Government invited various charitable organizations in Shanghai to form a committee for planning and constructing public housing. After its establishment, the committee constructed over one hundred public housing units and an assembly hall in the Quanjia'an Road, Zhabei. It also surveyed the vacant land of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Bureau at the intersection of Xietu Road and Luban Road in Nanshi as the site for the second public housing project and has reported it to the Municipal Government for the record. As for the construction of housing in other districts of the city, the appropriate locations should be selected in each district based on the number of shanties and the need for housing in the area for future sequential development. However, the Zhabei area is vast and the shanties are scattered, accounting for nearly one-half of the total number of shanties in the city. The one location on Quanjia'an Road is not enough to meet the needs of the western districts in the area. It seems that it should be divided into two locations. As for the four locations in Huxi, Nanshi, Pudong, and Wusong, one housing project is planned for construction in each area, so that when sufficient funds are raised in the future, they can be constructed sequentially. Therefore, the plan for the construction locations in each district has been resolved by the 30th Standing Committee Meeting of the Public Housing Construction Committee. However, due to the difficulty in raising funds, the realization of construction is still far away.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 1:35 PM, Public Bus No. 121, registration No. 5815, belonging to the Public Bus Company of the Public Concession and running from Caojiadu to Gaolang Bridge on Bazilu, was traveling from Caojiadu when a car, owned by the Japanese merchant Morimura Car Company, Concession License No. 3575, Municipal Government License No. 925, was speeding towards it from the opposite direction at the Dongzhuan Wan of Wujiaochang. Due to the driver's carelessness, it crashed directly into the front of the public bus. Although the brakes were applied, the front of the public bus was damaged. The police officer on duty saw this and detained both the driver of the car, Du Juyuan, and the driver of the public bus, at the Sixth District Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Arrest for Conspiracy to Steal Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Six Jiangbei natives, Bian Xiaorenzi, Lü Lugui, Tan Xiaofuzi, Guo Xiaowuzi, Xie Xiaosizi, and Shen Guirong, conspired to steal several rickshaws from the rickshaw companies opened by Zhang Faji and Peng Yuzhi in the French Concession some days ago. They hid the stolen vehicles at Weng Changgen's house, intending to sell them off. The crime was discovered by French Concession detectives Qin Youyu and Xu Guilin, who arrested the seven individuals, recovered the stolen goods, and brought them to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the French Court for prosecution. First, the plaintiffs filed complaints about the theft. When questioned, Bian Xiaorenzi and the others confessed to the conspiracy to steal. Weng Changgen confessed that Bian and the others hid the stolen vehicles at his place, agreeing to pay him one yuan per vehicle per day, which was true. Judge Zhu sentenced Bian to three months in the Western Jail, Lü and Tan to two months each, Guo and the other three to six weeks each, and Weng to a fine of five yuan, or five days in jail as a warning.</p>
<h3>Assault Without Cause Settled with Fine</h3>

Detectives and patrolmen arrived and arrested Cui and Zhu, bringing them to the police station. Yesterday, they were brought to the French Court for prosecution. The plaintiff, Yang Erxi, stated that the defendant, Cui Wansun, had barged into his house for no reason, asking for someone without saying who. This led to a minor argument. Unexpectedly, Cui returned with several people shortly after and, without asking why, seized and beat him. Fortunately, detectives arrived and made the arrest. He requested severe punishment. Cui Wansun confessed that he went to the plaintiff's house to look for a friend but couldn't find him. When the plaintiff punched him, he became enraged and invited friends to reason with him. He stammered in his testimony. Zhu Pinsan testified that he was there to mediate and did not participate in the assault. Judge Zhu fined Cui fifteen yuan, or fifteen days in jail if he couldn't pay. Zhu was fined ten yuan, or ten days in jail if he couldn't pay, as a warning.</p>

<p>Currently, the financial authorities have not clearly delineated the provincial tax and local municipal and county taxes. Therefore, it is difficult to have precise estimates for the method of sharing compulsory education expenses between the province and the counties and cities. Assuming that the central government and the province each bear half in the second year, starting from the third year, the central government will bear 45% of the compulsory education expenses, the province will bear 10%, and the local governments will bear 45%. Efforts should also be made to encourage private schools to reduce the public burden.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>(Note 1) The so-called "school attendance period" refers to situations such as wheat harvest breaks or half-day schools.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Currently, the national treasury is empty, there is a shortage of teachers, and rural farmers need children to help with work. If all school-age children nationwide are to enroll in school for four years without interruption, it may be difficult to achieve in reality. Therefore, a flexible approach is proposed, where children subject to compulsory education can choose one of the following five enrollment methods based on their family circumstances: A. Enroll in a formal primary school for four years.</p>
<p>B. Enroll in a formal primary school for three years, then switch to a supplementary school, studying for two hours every evening. After completing two years, it can be considered as graduation from elementary school. C. Enroll in a formal primary school for two years, then switch to a supplementary school, studying for two hours every evening. After completing four years, it can also be considered as graduation from elementary school.</p>
<p>D. Enroll in a formal primary school for one year, then switch to a supplementary school, studying for two hours every evening. After completing six years, it can also be considered as graduation from elementary school.</p>
<p>E. Those who cannot attend formal primary school continuously for one year or less can attend school for half a year each year. After two years, they can then enter a supplementary school to complete their elementary education.</p>
<p>In summary, one year of formal primary school is equivalent to two years of supplementary education, and half a year of formal primary school is equivalent to one year of supplementary education. Those who cannot continue attending formal primary school must enter a supplementary school to complete their required education. However, school-age children must attend formal primary school for at least one year, either continuously or divided into two half-year sessions.</p>
<p>(Note 3) These supplementary schools are specifically designed for children who cannot attend formal primary school. The content of the courses taught is the same as that of elementary school, but the curriculum of one year is taught over two years. In addition to two hours of classes every evening, students must be assigned homework to complete at home to compensate for the lack of classroom work.</p>
<p>(Note 4) The so-called self-study system involves assigning the required courses to children for self-study at home, with periodic examinations by the school. If they pass, they can be exempted from a portion of their compulsory schooling.</p>
<p>(Note 5) Currently, there are a total of 1,915 counties in the country. If each county establishes one urban and one rural compulsory education experimental zone, there should be 1,915 of each of the aforementioned two types of experimental zones nationwide. However, impoverished counties can jointly establish one or two experimental zones in collaboration with two or more counties. Therefore, this plan only stipulates the establishment of approximately 1,500 urban and rural compulsory education experimental zones each nationwide within five years.</p>
<p>(Note 6) The former University Council had already prepared investigation forms in 1928 and issued them to the education administrative organs of various provinces and cities, requesting detailed reports on the number of school-age children. The original deadline for submission was the end of 1928. However, at that time, the Northern Expedition had just been successfully completed, and the military operations had not ended for long. Many provinces delayed the investigation of school-age children. As of September 1929, only Nanjing Special Municipality had submitted the exact number of school-age children to the ministry. The remaining provinces and cities did not provide accurate reports. Therefore, the number of school-age children nationwide can only be estimated based on the approximate population of the country. In European and American countries, approximately one in six people is a school-age child. However, the "school-age period" for Chinese children is tentatively set from six to twelve years old, which is shorter than in Europe and America. Furthermore, compulsory education is also tentatively aimed at "enabling all school-age children nationwide to receive four years of elementary school education." Therefore, the number can be further reduced. For now, it is tentatively assumed that one in ten people is a school-age child subject to compulsory education.</p>
<p>As the population census in various provinces and cities has not been completed, there are no accurate reports on the total population of the country. According to the estimate of the Statistics Bureau of the Beijing State Council before 1915, the national population was 377,673,424 people. The estimate of the Postal Administration in 1925 was 436,094,953 people. The estimate of the Customs Administration in 1928 was 448,231,000 people. After consulting various gazetteers, it is felt that the number estimated by the Postal Administration is more approximate.</p>
<p>If calculated based on a population of over 436 million, there are over 43.6 million school-age children nationwide. Excluding those who have already enrolled, there are still over 37.19 million children who do not have the opportunity to receive elementary education. To implement compulsory education, these over 37 million school-age children must be enrolled in school.</p>
<p>(Note 7) According to statistics before 1924, over 6.4 million school-age children nationwide have already enrolled in school. The number of enrollees may have increased now, but there are no accurate statistics to rely on. Therefore, this number is still used for deduction.</p>
<p>(Note 8) Based on the survey results, a table listing the number of students taught per elementary school teacher in each province before 1924 is provided below:</p>
<p>Table of Average Number of Students Taught per Elementary School Teacher Nationwide</p>
<p>Province　Elementary School　Higher Elementary School　Elementary Vocational School　Average</p>
<p>Beiping Old Jingzhao Area　25.50　38.40　8.60　24.20</p>

<p>Guangxi　23.90　16.10　20.00</p>
<p>Yunnan　27.70　21.90　6.20　18.60</p>

<p>Chahar　51.40　44.70　48.50</p>
<p>Overall Average　26.10　18.50　8.10　17.60</p>
<p>Based on the above table, each elementary school teacher can teach an average of about 26 students. Now, based on the limits of a teacher's teaching ability, each teacher can teach an average of 40 elementary school students. In that case, to enroll over 40 million children in school, over one million additional teachers are needed. Assuming that 400,000 teachers retire in 20 years, then it will be sufficient to train 1.4 million teachers. According to the statistics of the China Education Improvement Society in 1925, there are a total of 195 normal schools nationwide, with a total of less than 10,000 graduates each year. There are also 106 normal school training courses and advanced courses, with a total of at most 5,000 graduates each year. To train over 1.4 million elementary school teachers in 20 years, a different approach is needed.</p>
<p>(Note 9) According to the educational statistics of various provinces before 1924, the average number of students per elementary school, calculated from urban and rural elementary schools, is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Average Number of Students per Elementary School in Each Province　　Province　Number of Students</p>
<p>Beiping and Old Beijing Area　30.00</p>
<p>Hebei　30.20</p>
<p>Liaoning　40.20</p>
<p>Jilin　48.40</p>
<p>Heilongjiang　13.60</p>
<p>Shandong　32.40</p>
<p>Henan　30.30</p>
<p>Shanxi　36.10</p>
<p>Jiangsu　51.10</p>
<p>Anhui　34.10</p>
<p>Jiangxi　46.38</p>
<p>Fujian　51.80</p>
<p>Zhejiang　42.20</p>
<p>Hubei　37.90</p>
<p>Hunan　30.90</p>
<p>Shaanxi　28.20</p>
<p>Gansu　46.40</p>
<p>Xinjiang　36.50</p>
<p>Sichuan　31.90</p>
<p>Guangdong　43.00</p>
<p>Guangxi　34.00</p>
<p>Yunnan　32.80</p>
<p>Guizhou　35.20</p>
<p>Rehe　24.60</p>
<p>Suiyuan　26.70</p>
<p>Chahar　55.60</p>
<p>Overall Average　36.59</p>
<p>According to the above, each classroom can only accommodate 36-37 students. When implementing compulsory education, the number of students that each classroom can accommodate should be increased as much as possible. Assuming that each classroom accommodates an average of 40 students, then at least one million classrooms need to be added when over 37.19 million children are fully enrolled in school.</p>

<p>Based on the above table, each elementary school student requires over five yuan of public funds each year, each higher elementary school student requires over nineteen yuan of public funds each year, and each elementary vocational school student requires over thirty-one yuan of public funds each year. For now, it is tentatively defined that the expenses for four years of compulsory education only need to be calculated according to the elementary school standard. Before 1924, each elementary school student only required five yuan of public funds each year. However, since the various provinces and cities came under the rule of the National Government, the salaries of elementary school teachers have mostly been increased, and the facilities of elementary schools have also been improved compared to before. Therefore, the required amount of public funds should be increased. Based on the current situation, each elementary school student should require at least seven yuan of public funds each year. If 40 million children are to be universally enrolled in elementary school, then the government needs to increase compulsory education funding by 280 million yuan each year.</p>
<p>(Note 11) Currently, the public treasury is in financial difficulty, and it is feared that new classrooms cannot be specially built. We can only borrow civilian housing and repair it to ensure that the light and air in the rooms are suitable. It costs about 500 yuan to open a new class (including housing repair fees, school equipment purchase fees, and other administrative expenses). If the government has to bear 200 yuan to train a teacher, then it will cost 200 million yuan to train 1 million teachers, which is probably not enough in reality.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2: Preliminary Plan for Implementing Adult Remedial Education</h3>
<p>(1) Objectives</p>
<p>The objective of this plan is to provide a short-term, remedial school education to young people and adults nationwide who have dropped out of school. This remedial education is extremely important, but it does not occupy a fixed position in our country's education system. For convenience, it is simply called adult remedial education. Adult remedial education inherently includes both national literacy training and vocational training. This plan is a preliminary plan, and it aims to complete the major task of national literacy training as soon as possible within the six years of political tutelage. As for vocational training, it can refer to the vocational education sections in Chapter 5, the Plan to Improve Secondary Education, and Chapter 7, the Plan to Improve Social Education.</p>
<p>(2) Principles</p>
<p>A. National literacy training should use the least amount of money and the shortest amount of time to enable the general public to have the ability to read and write and exercise their four rights.</p>
<p>B. National literacy training should start with organized groups of people and gradually extend to scattered populations. It should start in affluent areas and gradually extend to impoverished areas. Except for areas with natural disasters or special circumstances, it should not be delayed.</p>
<p>C. The age of those receiving national literacy training should range from 12 to 50 years old.</p>
<p>D. In national literacy training, not only those who are illiterate must bear the obligation to learn, but those who are already literate must also bear the obligation to teach.</p>
<p>E. The implementation of national literacy training should have very strict assessment.</p>
<p>F. After establishing a foundation in national literacy training, there should be opportunities for continued progress.</p>
<p>(3) Urgent Issues at Present</p>
<p>A. How to enable all out-of-school people nationwide to attend school? The illiterate population nationwide accounts for about 80% of the total population (Note 1). If the national population is tentatively estimated at 436,094,953 people, then based on various relationships and special reasons (Note 2), the number of those who are literate, illiterate, and should receive remedial education can be analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>I. Approximately 20% are literate, totaling 87,218,990 people.</p>
<p>II. Approximately 80% are illiterate, totaling 348,875,962 people.</p>
<p>1.  Approximately 13.33% are over 50 years old, totaling 58,131,457 people.</p>
<p>2.  Approximately 10% are school-age children, totaling 43,609,495 people.</p>
<p>3.  Approximately 10% are children under 6 years old, totaling 43,609,495 people.</p>
<p>4.  Approximately 0.25% are disabled such as blind, deaf, or mute, and those with mental or neurological illnesses, totaling 1,090,237 people.</p>
<p>5.  Approximately 46.42% should receive remedial education, totaling 202,435,277 people.</p>
<p>Based on this table, the literate and illiterate populations are analyzed in the following diagram. Observing the table and diagram above, we know that the number of people who should receive adult remedial education is over 202 million, accounting for nearly half of our country's total population. This is the total number of people we are targeting for adult remedial education. How to enable these illiterate people to become literate, read books and newspapers, and do arithmetic is the first thing that should be discussed.</p>
<p>B. How should the required teachers be trained? Running adult remedial education should proceed in parallel with the implementation of compulsory education, so there will be many opportunities for utilization. There will also be quite a few teachers who can be assisted. However, before compulsory education is fully popularized, every year there are many school-age children who drop out of school and secretly join the number of young people who are out of school as they get older. Therefore, even if all primary schools are also used as adult remedial education institutions and all primary school teachers are also adult remedial education teachers in the process of promoting compulsory education, it can only offset the number that increases each year at most. These 202.4 million out-of-school people require another source of teachers to solve the problem. Assuming that the national literacy training for the 202.4 million out-of-school people is completed in six years, an average of 33.74 million people must be trained each year. Each person receives four months of training, and training can be divided into three sessions within a year. Each session averages about 11.24 million people. Each teacher rotates to teach two classes, with an average of 50 people per class, meaning each teacher teaches an average of 100 people. Approximately 112,470 teachers are needed. Within six years, 12% of the teachers must be replaced (according to the estimate in Chapter 1, the Compulsory Education Plan, 2% are replaced each year). A total of approximately 135,000 teachers are needed. How should these huge numbers of teachers be selected and trained? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Preparations for the Conference</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education authorities of various provinces and cities on the 7th, instructing them to arrive in Beijing on schedule. There were also telegrams reporting that they had already started their journey, such as Hou Hongjian, the representative of the Fujian Education Department, who has already arrived in Beijing. As for the plan to improve national education, it has now been sent to the printer for application during the meeting. The Ministry of Education will print all the laws and regulations promulgated since its establishment into a booklet for the reference of the attending members. During the conference, the Ministry of Education will publish a special issue of the Second National Education Conference daily, which has been designated to be edited by Peng Baichuan from the Editorial Section. The conference venue is set in the Railway Department Auditorium in Sajiawan, and preparations have already begun. The Preparatory Committee will hold its second meeting on the 12th of this month, and all national committee members will attend. Yang Fang, Counselor, has been reassigned as the Director of the Reception Section, and Zheng Tianting, Secretary, has been reassigned as the Director of the Editorial Section.</p>
<h3>Education Director of Shanghai Municipality Attends</h3>
<p>As the opening of the National Education Conference is approaching, the Ministry of Education recently telegraphed to inquire whether Director Chen of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau would attend in person. Chen replied that the conference is related to national education, and the proposals also need to be explained, so he will attend in person at the time.</p>
<h3>Sun Guiding Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dr. Sun Guiding, Dean of the College of Education of Xiamen University, arrived in Shanghai on the 7th with Dr. Lin Wenqing, President of Xiamen University, and Mr. Ye Caizhen, Director of the Jimei Schools. Dr. Sun is currently residing at No. 154 Qingxiang Lane, Avenue Edward VII and will proceed to Beijing in the next day or two to attend the National Education Conference. Dr. Lin and others are staying at the Astor House Hotel. This trip is on behalf of Mr. Tan Kah Kee, an overseas Chinese businessman, to request the National Government to grant tax exemption to the products of Tan Kah Kee's company. It is reported that the Xiamen University and Jimei Schools founded by Mr. Tan bear more than 300,000 yuan in regular expenses each year.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Issues Order to Various Bookstores</h3>
<p>Book Titles of Various Textbooks Being Edited Should Be Simple and Appropriate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order to various bookstores yesterday, stating, "To enforce the matter, in accordance with Order No. 324 of the Ministry of Education, regarding the matters that should be marked on the covers of various textbooks, the Ministry has prescribed six measures for rectification and has ordered the deletion of general book titles such as 'New Era' and 'New Doctrine'."</p>
<p>"All bookstores are hereby ordered to comply with and rectify accordingly, without any delay. Later, the Shanghai Booksellers Association submitted a statement stating the difficulties in deleting the general book titles and requesting that they be given discretion to make changes. The Ministry rejected the request and reiterated the previous order, instructing all bookstores to comply without any delay. Now, the Shanghai Zhonghua Book Company has reported that canceling words such as 'New China' and 'New Primary School' will make the book titles of various bookstores easily confused, causing difficulties for buyers to distinguish them, and requested that the Ministry review and issue instructions for compliance."</p>
<p>"Also attached are two copies each of the cover samples of the 'New China Chinese Language Reader' and the 'New Primary School Chinese Language Reader' sent to the Ministry. The Ministry believes that the various textbooks published by various bookstores often have the same specific general title above the book title, forming a set. The titles are too complicated, and it is doubtful whether the editing has a complete plan and whether the content has a practical connection. Moreover, the quality of the teaching materials varies. Among the books in the same set, some have been approved by the Ministry, and some have not. Therefore, although the name is a set, it is mostly incomplete. The specific general title that makes up a set has long lost its effect. Therefore, we have repeatedly ordered the deletion of the name."</p>
<p>"Now, the bookstore has repeatedly submitted reports on the difficulties faced by the bookstore and buyers and has changed the 'New China Textbook' and 'New Primary School Textbook' to 'New China New Primary School', listing it at the top of the book title in one line, and changed 'Textbook' to 'Coursebook', such as 'New China [Something] Coursebook' and 'New Primary School [Something] Coursebook'. The names are simpler and easier to identify. The claim that it is easy to confuse among various bookstores and difficult for buyers to distinguish is not unreasonable in fact. Therefore, we will temporarily allow changes. The names 'New China Chinese Language Coursebook' and 'New Primary School Chinese Language Coursebook' submitted by the bookstore should be approved for adoption, but the book titles of textbooks in the future should be as simple and appropriate as possible. The various bookstores should submit them to the Ministry for approval at any time to ensure consistency."</p>
<p>"In addition to the instructions, we hereby issue another order instructing the bookstores to comply accordingly. This order."</p>
<h3>Four More Boy Scouts Qualify for Registration</h3>
<p>The Training Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters previously conducted the registration of China Boy Scout service members. In addition to the 17 people who were reviewed and announced by the Central Committee on the 4th, there are now four more qualified people who have arrived at the department. Their names are as follows: Yao Jiarui, Zheng Runzhen, Zhang Shifang, and Zeng Shisong. The certificates and badges of these members have been sent to the Municipal Training Department from Beijing and are awaiting collection.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau Convenes Meeting of Principals of Secondary and Higher Education Institutions in the City Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Education Bureau, together with the Propaganda Department of the Central Executive Committee and the Shanghai Municipal Government, issued an order to secondary and higher education institutions in the city, stating, "To comply with the matter, it is hereby decided to convene a discussion meeting for the principals of secondary and higher education institutions in the city at 2:00 PM on April 9 at the Special Municipal Education Bureau on Dajilu. All principals should attend on time."</p>
<h3>Qu Shao Yi to Lecture at the Universal Student Association</h3>

<h3>Recent Results of Various Teams in the Chinese Football Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Football Association has been in progress for five months since the start of the season. According to the original schedule, it should have ended by now. However, due to weather conditions, the competition has been delayed. Many teams in each group have withdrawn or forfeited halfway through. There are still more than ten matches left unplayed. The weather is unfavorable, and there is nothing that can be done. The Cooperative Advancement Association has decided to temporarily cancel the A and B level Cooperative Advancement Cup matches this year to allow the United Association matches to end earlier. The results of each team's matches are listed below:</p>

<h3>The Eighth Day of the National Games</h3>
<p>Heavy rain yesterday… Rest day</p>
<p>Competitions continue today… Strive again</p>
<p>Closing ceremony tomorrow morning…</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Games Suspended Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the National Games. Thunder rumbled in the morning, and heavy rain poured down. All the sports fields became swamps. The Competition Section of the Games, considering that the fields were difficult to use, announced a one-day postponement. The athletes have been working hard and competing intensely for days since the opening ceremony, inevitably becoming physically and mentally exhausted. Taking this opportunity to recuperate will allow them to show their skills even better in the finals.</p>
<h3>Closing Ceremony Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 10th</p>
<p>Undetermined Championships Will Be Awarded Later</p>
<p>The closing ceremony of the Games was originally scheduled to be held at the track and field stadium at 1:00 PM on the 10th, as the rostrum was equipped with wireless telephone broadcasting for convenience. However, due to the heavy rain yesterday morning and the one-day suspension, the competitions had to be postponed until 5:00 or 6:00 PM on the 10th to be completed. President Dai Jitao and Vice President Zhang Jingjiang were also in urgent need of returning to the capital for official business on the afternoon of the 10th. Therefore, they discussed with Directors Zhu and Zhou yesterday afternoon and decided to hold the closing ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 10th. No matter what, it cannot be postponed. The prizes for the determined women's track and field, men's track and field, all-around, and baseball championships will be awarded first. The undetermined championships for men's basketball, volleyball, soccer, tennis, and swimming will be awarded the next day. The prizes for the overall championship will also be postponed for two days.</p>
<h3>Protecting Referees</h3>
<p>Armed Police Protection Starts Today</p>
<p>After the Liaoning vs. Nanjing soccer game the day before yesterday, the referee Huang Wenjian was beaten and injured. Currently, all referees are fearful of serving the Games. To protect human rights and maintain the prestige and safety of the referees, the Games will deploy armed police protection for the referees of all ball games starting today. If such an unfortunate incident occurs again, the police will be made to suffer disgrace rather than allowing the referees to be endangered.</p>
<h3>The Games Hosted a Farewell for He Yingqin Yesterday</h3>
<p>He Yingqin, Vice President of the National Games, arrived in Hangzhou on the 5th and went to the Games to observe the competitions. He was deeply satisfied with the spirit of the athletes and the layout of the venue. He took a train to Shanghai at 5:30 PM on the 8th. President Dai Jitao and Zhang Jingjiang, Chen Bulei, Zhou Xiangxian, Ma Xun, and over a hundred members of the military band went to the station to bid him farewell. He was extremely happy when he left.</p>

<h3>### Baseball Championship</h3>
<p>Tianjin and Hong Kong to Compete Today</p>
<p>Previous Competition Overview</p>
<p>Baseball has historically lacked promotion in our country. Consequently, the number of teams participating in the Games is smaller compared to other sports. Seven teams, including Hunan, Shanghai, Tianjin, Hubei, Jiangxi, Beiping, and Hong Kong, registered. In the actual competition, only Hunan, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hong Kong started the first round. Shanghai defeated Hunan with a score of 11-0. Subsequently, Shanghai competed against Tianjin, initially holding a 1-0 lead for the first six innings. However, their efforts fell short, and Tianjin, in a desperate situation, surpassed them, ultimately securing the final qualification with a score of 4-1. Tianjin's victory was attributed to their powerful hitting, with each player displaying exceptional agility and prowess. Additionally, Shanghai committed two significant errors, leading to Tianjin's ultimate success. Hong Kong boasts many talented players and is considered a strong contender for the championship. The area is seen as having superior talent and the victory is anticipated. The ultimate outcome of the championship will depend on the efforts of the Tianjin and Hong Kong teams today.</p>

<h3>Swimming Championship</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Team Likely to Win the Championship</p>
<p>Liaoning, Guangdong, and Shanghai to Compete for Second Place</p>
<p>The results of the first day of the swimming competition preliminaries showed that the Liaoning team was a surprising success. Shi Xinglong won the one-mile freestyle with excellent results. Hong Kong secured the second and fourth positions respectively, while Guangdong came in third. The Shanghai team did not qualify. However, the Liaoning team has too few members, making their championship hopes slim. Hong Kong has a wealth of talent. Judging from the preliminary results, they can steadily secure first place in the point standings. The remaining unaired events include the 220-yard breaststroke and the 160-yard medley relay. With Hong Kong's average talent, the championship in the 160-yard race is assured. Therefore, the swimming championship is likely to go to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>### Shi Xinglong's Swimming Posture, Photography: Lin Zeren</h3>
<p>As for the second place, based on the results, the Liaoning team has the highest hopes. Shi Xinglong is likely to win the 100-yard and 440-yard races. Guangdong is likely to win the 100-yard backstroke. Although Yu Binqi from Shanghai secured first place in the third group, the results are significantly different, making their hopes slim, but they can certainly secure a position. The remaining three events will be more difficult to score points in. Therefore, although the Liaoning, Guangdong, and Shanghai teams will compete for second place, Liaoning and Guangdong have better chances. Let's predict the scores of each team and compare them with the final results.</p>
<h3>Predicted Scores for Each Team</h3>
<p>Event: 50-Yard Freestyle, 100-Yard Freestyle, 440-Yard Freestyle, 100-Yard Backstroke (Already Determined), One-Mile Final</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 6 points, 4 points, 5 points, 1 point, 4 points</p>
<p>Liaoning: 3 points, 5 points, 6 points, 0 points, 5 points</p>
<p>Guangdong: 0 points, 2 points, 0 points, 7 points, 2 points</p>
<p>Shanghai: 1 point, 1 point, 0 points, 3 points, 0 points</p>
<p>Totals</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 20 points, Liaoning: 19 points, Guangdong: 11 points</p>
<p>Shanghai: 5 points</p>
<p>However, there are still the 220-yard breaststroke and the 160-yard medley relay. These predictions should not cause a problem with the positions. The individual totals for Chen Qisong and Chen Zhenxing from Hong Kong, and Shi Xinglong from Liaoning, will be competitive.</p>
<h3>Overview of Men's Volleyball</h3>
<p>South China Has More Opportunities to Practice</p>
<p>Guangdong and Hong Kong Have a Good Chance in the Semifinals</p>
<p>The men's teams participating in the Volleyball Championship this year include Fujian, Tianjin, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hong Kong, Liaoning, Shanghai, Hunan, Henan, Beiping, and Nanjing – a total of fourteen units. The women's teams include Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai A, Liaoning, Anhui, Beiping A, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Tianjin, Hunan, Beiping B, Shanghai B, Yin, and Fujian – fourteen teams. Except for the Henan men's team and the Fujian women's team, which did not arrive due to reasons, there are actually thirteen teams competing for men and women, with a total of over 400 athletes. Talented individuals from the North and South gather together to learn from each other and improve through competition. This is an unprecedented event in the history of sports in our country. The spectators are extremely crowded during the matches, averaging around two to three thousand people. The scene is lively and prosperous. In the early stage of sports in our country, the enthusiasm for volleyball, which people are not normally interested in, is a good sign. The reporter has been on the scene every day, comparing the strengths of each team and understanding the situation of the competition over the past week. A simple overview is provided for those who are interested in this sport.</p>
<p>Volleyball in our country originated in South China. The climate in provinces like Fujian and Guangdong is warmer, making them suitable for this sport. As a result, more people practice it, the interest is stronger, and the technical progress is faster. Many talented individuals have emerged. The representatives of our country who have participated in the past Far Eastern Games have all been selected from these provinces, winning championships and bringing glory to the country. Therefore, historically speaking, the teams from Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Fujian are the best in this competition. However, the Shanghai team is also composed of the elite players from the city, making them one of the best in East China. Talented players like Cao Tingzan, Xie Baochang, and Li Xinbiao are all well-known. Unfortunately, they faced the strong Hong Kong team in the preliminary round and were defeated. Otherwise, they would have had a good chance of winning the second place. The Liaoning and Nanjing teams are relatively better. The talent in the two teams is average. However, Liaoning is located in the Northeast, where the weather is cold and there is more rain and snow. There are fewer opportunities for practice and a lack of competition with strong teams, so their experience is naturally worse. The Nanjing team is said to be represented by the Central Military Academy. Most of the team members are from Fujian and Guangdong and have a good foundation in this sport. However, they have not been formed for long, and it is difficult to say that their coordination is perfect. The strength in the match with Beiping wasn't weak. They have now won the next round and will compete against Hong Kong in the semifinals. The players from Jiangsu and Tianjin are also very skilled, but overall, they are not as balanced as Liaoning and Nanjing. As a result, they will face Guangdong in the next round, making it difficult for them to stand out. The other teams from Zhejiang, Hubei, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Beiping lack long-term practice and experience in battle. Their formation is scattered, their defense is negligent, and their coordination is not smooth. Therefore, they were eliminated in the preliminary round.</p>
<p>Volleyball has now entered the semifinal stage. Fujian vs. Guangdong and Hong Kong vs. Nanjing will soon compete against each other. From the reporter's perspective, Guangdong and Hong Kong have a better chance of winning. In terms of individual skills, Chen Xibing from the Hong Kong team is an exceptional talent. His smashing skills have reached perfection. No ball can escape his grasp. He is praised as the number one player in East Asia, and this is not an exaggeration.</p>
<h3>Comments on Women's Volleyball</h3>
<p>The Strength of Each Team Varies</p>
<p>But the Spirit Remains Consistent</p>
<p>Guangdong Team Has a Better Chance of Winning the Championship</p>
<p>Volleyball was introduced to our country relatively late. With the exception of the major commercial ports of Guangdong and Shanghai, very few people in the inland provinces practice it. Many don't even understand the rules well. It's even harder to popularize it among women. However, thirteen teams are competing in this tournament, which is unexpected. Although the strength of each team varies, their spirit remains consistent. The stronger teams are not arrogant because of their victories, and the weaker teams are not discouraged by their defeats. They truly understand the essence of sports, which is commendable.</p>
<p>The reason why the volleyball teams in South China are strong has been described in the previous section, and the same is true for women's teams. Based on the observation of the competition over the past seven days and the comparison of the results published daily, the Guangdong team has the highest chance of winning the championship. Shanghai A also has a good chance, but it will be more difficult for them to win against Guangdong. It depends on their luck at that time. The strength of Beiping A is also quite strong. Although they lost to Shanghai A, their excellent performance was praised by the audience. Therefore, people cannot be judged by their wins and losses. Shanghai B is an emerging force with a very lively style. If they can gain more experience through competition, there will be unlimited potential for their future development. The remaining teams are mostly located inland, with less exposure and slightly worse teaching methods. Therefore, they are flustered in battle, lacking coordination and unable to cope with strong opponents. This is due to the different environments they are in, and the talent of the players cannot be used as a standard. Now that Guangdong and Shanghai A have qualified for the finals, the competition on the 9th will be the key to the championship. The two teams will do their best to compete against each other. The performance at that time will surely meet the expectations of the audience.</p>
<h3>Men's Basketball Championship</h3>
<p>Entering a Close Combat Phase</p>
<p>Tianjin Will Easily Defeat Beiping</p>
<p>Shanghai to Compete with Hong Kong</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai team defeated Liaoning with a score of 53-44 and the Hong Kong team defeated Kobe with a score of 57-43 the day before, Hong Kong and Shanghai have each secured a place in the semifinals. It was originally scheduled for them to compete yesterday, but due to the unsuitable playing conditions of the two venues, the match was postponed to today. It is expected that there will be an extremely fierce competition. The other team that has qualified for the semifinals is Tianjin and Beiping. The two winning teams will then compete in the final to win the championship. Therefore, the men's basketball championship on these two days has entered a close combat phase. The past results and the current situation of each team are described in detail, so that the outcome of the championship can be predicted with a high degree of certainty.</p>

<h3>Past Results</h3>
<p>Judging from the past results, in the first week of the first round, Tianjin first defeated Jiangxi with a score of 154-4. Jiangsu defeated Guangdong with a score of 40-27. Beiping won by default against Hunan. Zhejiang defeated Anhui with a score of 36-15. In the second week, Tianjin defeated Jiangsu with a score of 34-13. Beiping defeated Zhejiang with a score of 75-24. Therefore, the only remaining teams are Tianjin and Beiping. In the first week of the second round, Shanghai first won by default against Shandong. Liaoning defeated Fujian with a score of 89-16. Kobe defeated Hubei with a score of 91-46. Hong Kong defeated Nanjing with a score of 43-20. In the second week, Shanghai defeated Liaoning and Hong Kong defeated Kobe. The remaining teams are Hong Kong and Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Strength of the Four Teams</h3>
<p>The four teams of Tianjin, Beiping, Shanghai, and Hong Kong each have their own strengths. Tianjin excels in cooperation and agility, Beiping has an advantage in physique, Shanghai is known for its accurate shooting, and Hong Kong is renowned for its liveliness and agility. Tianjin and Beiping have successively held the top position in North China. However, since the Beiping team was defeated by the Nankai team from Tianjin in the last North China Games, famous players such as Quan Yan have left the team, and the talent has declined. It is difficult for them to maintain their current state. The representatives of Beiping today are mostly new players. Although the newborn calves are not afraid of tigers, the five tigers of the Tianjin team are experienced and have the support of Yao Enhan from the Rotary Club, Li Qingan, the famous center from the YMCA, and the internal guard He Buyun. Therefore, it is predicted that Tianjin has a good chance of winning the match against Beiping.</p>
<h3>Shanghai vs. Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Next, let's talk about the match between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Although the Hong Kong team is lively and agile, the Shanghai team has a wealth of talent. Players such as He Rutong and Lu Zhongen are all famous players. The five-man zone defense is also well-practiced. It is predicted that Hong Kong will ultimately concede. But in any case, there will be a fierce battle. If Shanghai doesn't work hard, their future is uncertain.</p>

<h3>Tianjin vs. Shanghai Finals</h3>
<p>Based on general observations, the teams most likely to qualify for the finals are Tianjin and Shanghai. The strength of the two teams is evenly matched, and it is difficult to say who will win. However, Tianjin's cooperation skills and strategies seem to be slightly better than Shanghai's, based on past results. This is something that the Shanghai team should pay close attention to.</p>
<h3>Brief Description of Women's Basketball</h3>
<p>Shanghai, Beiping, and Guangdong Compete for the Championship</p>
<p>Hoping that Each Team Will Make a Final Effort</p>
<p>After the Shanghai team defeated the Jiangsu team by a large margin the day before, securing a place in the finals, their hopes for the championship have also increased. On the other hand, Guangdong and Beiping still need to compete against each other to compete for the final qualification. Judging from past results, Beiping seems to be slightly better than Guangdong. The Guangdong team is not very familiar with the rules of women's basketball, and they have been practicing again after arriving in Hangzhou, which is a disadvantage. The Beiping basketball team has long been famous in North China, and the forwards are particularly lively. If they meet Shanghai in the championship game in the future, there will be an unprecedented fierce battle. Chen Yingrui, the right forward of the Shanghai team, and Guo Xiaoping, the center, are particularly outstanding. Shanghai is likely to be the best in terms of shooting accuracy. However, in terms of physique, the Shanghai team seems to be inferior to Beiping and Guangdong. Therefore, it is difficult to say for sure who the champion will be at this time. In short, the teams with the best chances are Shanghai, Beiping, and Guangdong. It is hoped that the players of each team will make efforts to advance and those who put in the most effort will likely win the championship.</p>
<h3>Men's Tennis Championship</h3>
<p>Seizing the Overall Championship is a Key</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Shanghai Must Fight to the Death</p>
<p>Among the sports championships, the tennis championship is the most difficult to predict. This is because Lin Baohua from Shanghai, and Jiang Daozhang and He Jialiu from Hong Kong, have not been able to participate. Therefore, apart from the four teams from Guangdong, Shanghai, Beijing, and Hong Kong, which have stronger strength, the rest are average. After the elimination of the first and second rounds, only the four teams from Shanghai, Guangdong, Beijing, and Hong Kong remain, and they will meet in the semifinals.</p>
<p>In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the four teams competed in the semifinals on the tennis court. Shanghai faced Guangdong, and Hong Kong faced Beijing. Each team played two singles matches. Zheng Zhaojia from Shanghai performed averagely, far less agile and lively than he was in Shanghai. Unfortunately, he was defeated. Wu Shaoxiang's performance has been very outstanding in recent days. The battle the day before yesterday was particularly remarkable. His opponent was Zhao Shilun from Guangdong, who tried his best to resist, but was ultimately defeated by Wu in both matches. As a result, Shanghai and Guangdong each won one match. Hong Kong defeated Nanjing in both matches without much effort. There is still one doubles match and two singles matches each. It was originally scheduled to continue the competition yesterday, but the weather was bad. There was heavy rain yesterday morning, and all the venues were very muddy and unusable. Therefore, it was changed to continue the competition today. Although it is impossible to determine who will win the final, Hong Kong's victory over Nanjing and qualification for the final is more certain than Shanghai's victory over Guangdong.</p>
<p>The outcome of this tennis championship is a key to the Hong Kong and Shanghai teams' quest for the overall championship. Apart from the all-around championship and the football championship that Shanghai can secure, they have no certainty in other events. Hong Kong can be confident in winning only in the swimming and baseball events. However, they also have a very good chance in volleyball. If the Shanghai team cannot win the tennis championship, then the overall championship will also be lost. Therefore, the Shanghai team must fight to the death for today's doubles match.</p>
<h3>Who Will Win the Women's Tennis Championship? Shanghai and Tianjin Will Fight for It</h3>
<p>Fourteen women's tennis teams have been fighting hard. The strong survive, the weak are eliminated. The winners stay, the losers go. The remaining teams are Tianjin and Guangdong, and Beiping and Shanghai. The results of the matches are that Tianjin won all two singles matches against Guangdong, and Shanghai won all two singles matches against Beiping. The outcome of the doubles match today will determine who will qualify for the final. Let's observe the past results to predict the future outcome.</p>
<h3>Tianjin is More Likely to Win Against Guangdong</h3>
<p>Tianjin was seeded in the preliminary round. Although they only won against Jiangsu in the second round, the Liang sisters have high tennis skills. Although Guangdong defeated Hubei and then defeated Nanjing, they cannot be underestimated. However, the results of the two battles were: (1) Liang Peiyao from Tianjin defeated Huang Yunyi from Guangdong with a score of 2-0, with scores of 6-4, 6-4. (2) Liang Peiyu from Tianjin defeated Deng Zhihao from Guangdong with a score of 2-0, with scores of 6-2, 6-4. In today's doubles match between the Liang sisters from Tianjin and Huang and Deng from Guangdong, Tianjin is likely to win. Although Guangdong still has Huang Nengqiu, it is feared that she will ultimately be unable to stem the tide. Therefore, Tianjin can win the first semifinal qualification.</p>
<h3>Beiping Cannot Defeat Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Beiping team first defeated Hunan, then defeated Liaoning, taking advantage of the momentum to meet Shanghai. However, Li Lian, the Javanese tennis flower of the Shanghai team, and Principal Kuai Shuping, a skilled female tennis player, are skilled in slicing, hitting, and pressing. Therefore, Li Lian defeated Du Lianjie from Beiping in the first match. In the second match, Liao Shuyun lost to Kuai Shuping. In today's doubles match, the Shanghai duo of Wang Dale and Su Zuqi will face Du and Liao from Tianjin. Shanghai's victory can be asserted. Even if they are defeated, the two singles matches will be switched, and Shanghai's victory will be easy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Tianjin to Win the Championship in the End</h3>
<p>The battle between Tianjin and Shanghai will determine who the champion will be. The strength of the two teams is evenly matched, and it is difficult to say who will win. The Liang sisters are not weak, and Li Lian and Kuai Shuping are also skilled players. Some say that Shanghai has a better chance, but the reporter dares not make a statement.</p>
<h3>Football Musings</h3>
<p>Championship Prediction</p>
<p>A total of twelve teams participated in this football competition. Due to the absence of the Beiping and Henan teams, only ten teams remain. In terms of strength, Shanghai is the strongest and can secure the championship. The next is the Guangdong team, followed by the Tianjin and Liaoning teams. Unexpectedly, the two teams failed in the second round and the semifinals, respectively. As a result, the Nanjing team jumped to second place. The Hong Kong team did not register for this competition, which is the most unfortunate thing. Otherwise, the situation of confrontation in the finals will be even more sensational and will add a lot of color to the conference.</p>

<h3>Brief Comments on Football Skills</h3>
<p>In my personal opinion, the most pleasing in the past competitions are the passing skills of the Shanghai team and the running skills of the Guangdong team. The bravery of Tianjin and Liaoning, and the quirkiness of the Hunan team, are also enough to add color to the venue. In terms of individual skills, Chen Guangyao's dribbling, feinting east and attacking west, is as still as a virgin and as fast as a rabbit. Dai Linjing's hooked ball, heading, and turning around, and Chen Yutian's interception and turning, are as light as swallows, which can be said to have reached the stage. Zhou Xianyan's high blocks and diving saves have reached perfection and are truly rare talents in football. Other techniques, such as Li Ning's tackling and Chen Junpei's saves, have been recorded in the ball battle records and do not need to be described in detail.</p>
<h3>Cheers</h3>
<p>In the match between Nanjing and Liaoning, before the competition, the captain of the Nanjing team, Jiang Jingnan, declared his welcome to cheer. The female athletes immediately responded with "Rah! Rah! Rah! Nonking!" drawing it out in an especially long cheer while the Liaoning team chanted "Good! Lao Liu, one more!" each cheer echoing and responding to the other. One side was soft and delicate, and the other was loud and strong. It was a beautiful story in the competition.</p>

<h3>The Significance of the Games</h3>
<p>By Zhou Xiangxian, Deputy Director of the Games Organizing Committee</p>
<p>Since the Easternization of Europe, our country has been advocating sports for more than a day. However, it is a groundbreaking event for the Chinese nation when the government promotes athletes from various provinces to gather in one area, training constantly, competing again and again. The National Games, such as the one today, is a grand occasion. The various prizes prepared in the meeting are solemn and splendid, and listed in front of everyone. Those who are particularly strong won the championship, triumphant, and return. How dignified, how glorious. In sports, everyone has this psychology, that is, in the sports visit of you, also everyone has this concept, although, this only on the table to say.</p>
<p>Guangdong Swimming Athlete Chun Yuanhua, Photographer</p>
<p>Today's sports are based on the spirit of struggle, there is the physical education of the people, there is the heart of mutual encouragement and encouragement, and there is no intention of mutual jealousy and destruction. Victory is gratifying, and not winning is not enough to be humiliated. From the perspective of those who do not win, how can we know that this setback is not just to teach and perfect the other day's victory? Yue Wang Goujian's dwelling in Kuaiji, Napoleon's confinement in a deserted island, Columbus's anger at the boatmen, and finally finding the Americas were all victories from defeat. Moreover, the referees are fair and impartial, and come out to judge with the qualifications of obligations, without any selfishness. Even if the gap is a millimeter, it is inevitable to be uneven, all of which belong to compatriots, and will never be subject to the calculation of gains and losses, but will be ridiculed from outside. The views are so, I dare not remain silent, and I deeply hope that you will pay attention to the traces of sports, pay attention to the spirit of sports, and especially pay attention to the morality of sports.</p>
<h3>Chief Jiang Visited the Meeting</h3>
<p>Arriving in Hangzhou Today</p>
<p>Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Education is scheduled to arrive at the meeting today (9th) to attend the closing ceremony and deliver a speech. The senior officials of the National Government staying in Hangzhou will return to Nanjing after the end of the Games.</p>
<h3>Stage Highlights</h3>
<p>Splashing Waves: When the swimming competition was held the other day, the audience was packed, with hardly any space left. The pool was small, and with so many people swimming, the water moved a lot, causing waves to splash everywhere. Those who were close could see clearly, but the water splashed a lot.</p>
<p>Accumulated Water Forms Puddles: Yesterday's heavy rain caused the cancellation of the competition, and all the fields accumulated water. In some places, it was deep enough to submerge feet, especially on the track and field area. Looking out, it was a vast expanse of water. Workers were busy dredging and filling in depressions with mud. Even the command platform was damp and uncomfortable, a far cry from the grand scene of the previous few days. The unprecedented large dining hall, which could accommodate over two thousand people eating at the same time and seated 300 people, was originally covered with reed mats, which couldn't withstand the wind and rain. Yesterday morning's heavy rain, combined with the low-lying ground, turned it into a swamp in an instant. Thanks to the workers who rushed to dig small canals to drain the water, the situation was brought under control. Some athletes praised their efforts, saying they were no less than Yu the Great's taming of the floods.</p>
<p>Relieving Itch for Skills: Because the competition was postponed for a day, some athletes braved the rain to climb mountains, seek out secluded spots, and explore scenic areas. Others went boating on the lake to enjoy the unique charm of the lake in the rain, which was different from the lake under the clear sky. However, those who were less interested in boating and found it difficult to endure the itch for skills engaged in games of mahjong to pass the time. In the dining hall, on the tables where the ground was relatively high, male and female athletes were gathered, playing mahjong, poker, and other games of leisure without any monetary stakes. The joy was no less than that of intense matches.</p>
<p>Each According to Their Conscience: In the women's 200-meter relay race, the Eastern Special District team and the Guangdong team clashed, causing multiple disputes. After mediation, it was agreed to rerun the race. As a result, the Guangdong team did not show up, and the organizers were unable to cope. The representative of the Eastern Special District team made a long speech on the command platform, talking about relying on their conscience.</p>
<p>Finding Joy in Hardship: Reporters from various newspapers who were covering the news at the games all devoted themselves wholeheartedly to their work. Someone calculated that the reporters walked no less than 20,000 meters each day, which was as long as a race. Mr. Chen Shouyin, the business section chief of the Hangzhou Electric Power Plant, deeply understood the reporters' hardships. Yesterday, he specially distributed invitations saying, "You are responsible for guiding society and presiding over public opinion. This time, you are running around for the cause of sports, braving wind and dust, and working hard for the country. Our plant cordially invites you to a light meal at our cinema (referring to the Hangzhou Electric Power Plant's cinema) at 7 p.m. on the 8th of this month, and to watch a movie to soothe the loneliness of being away from home and to spend this precious moment. The beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains awaits you." The words were beautiful and sweet. The reporters, finding joy in hardship, were deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Drivers Get Northernized: In recent days, the rickshaw fares at the entrance of the venue have been very expensive. The rickshaw drivers are from the Jiangbei and Shaoxing gangs. Usually, they speak with heavy local accents, but these days, they can even speak Northern Mandarin, discussing fares in fluent Mandarin. They no longer say "a few jiaos (tenths of a yuan)," but instead say "a few maos (tenths of a yuan)." Yesterday morning, after the heavy rain, the shy sun gradually appeared in the afternoon. The general public knew that the final few days of the competition would mostly be championship finals, so many came to the venue. The city was emptied. When they arrived at the venue and learned of the postponement, they took the same rickshaws back, spending several yuan just to enjoy a ride. It was truly a waste.</p>
<p>Anxious Staff: Yesterday afternoon, Hangzhou cleared up, the clouds parted, and the sun came out, making it possible to continue the competition. Unfortunately, an urgent notice had been issued earlier, saying that "due to the continuous rain and the difficulty in using the fields, all competitions will be postponed by one day." Now that the rain had stopped, it would have been best not to affect the overall schedule. However, if they wanted to order the competitions to resume as scheduled, many athletes were out enjoying the lake and mountains and would be difficult to gather. The staff was anxiously rendered useless and merely became material for frivolous news. However, playful as the words were, they also offered a few earnest suggestions. Please tell the staff to be more careful in the future. If the announcement made yesterday morning had been a little more flexible, such as saying, "The competitions scheduled for the morning will be difficult to hold on time due to the rain. The competitions scheduled for the afternoon will be announced later depending on the weather," then there would have been no need to worry.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Educational Groups Prepare to Host Athletes</h3>
<p>Reception at 1 p.m. on the 13th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipality Education Bureau, the World Chinese Students' Federation, and other organizations jointly initiated a meeting of various universities in Shanghai to host athletes from all regions passing through Shanghai for the National Games. A preparatory meeting was held at 3 p.m. yesterday. Representatives from various universities who attended included Luo Qingbin from Tongji University, Fu Xunren from Jinan University, Shao Jialin from Daxia University, Hu Xiansheng from Datong University, Jiang Henglin and Pan Runfu from Shanghai Law and Political Science College, Ni Zeshun from Chih Tze University, Zhu Shaoping from the World Chinese Students' Federation, and others. Organizations that wished to join but did not attend the preparatory meeting included the National Labor University, the Sino-French University, the Department of Pharmacy, and Fudan University. Mr. Zhu presided over the meeting and decided on the following matters: (1) The date was tentatively set for 1 p.m. on April 13th; (2) The location would be announced after it was finalized; (3) Each organization would send four staff members (three men and one woman); (4) Plans for funding, entertainment programs, and souvenirs had also been discussed.

<h3>Rin Tin Tin Retires to His Hometown</h3>
<p>— Sea Guest</p>
<p>Everyone who watches movies must know the dog star Rin Tin Tin. Rin Tin Tin is smart, chivalrous, and brave, practically surpassing humans. He was born in Alsace, France. He was first discovered by Captain Duncan, an American aviator. During the European War, when the United States joined the war, the captain was ordered to Europe to serve on the front lines. One day, he saw a puppy in a German trench. He loved its cleverness and immediately took it back to camp. After the war ended, he brought it back to the United States, and it became a movie star. He starred in many famous films at Warner Brothers, becoming colleagues with major stars like John Barrymore, Al Jolson, and others. His annual salary was about 25,000 pounds, equivalent to about 300,000 silver dollars. For a dog to achieve this, it is quite a feat. Rin Tin Tin is twelve years old this year, which is not considered old for a dog. However, according to recent news from Hollywood, he has retired. It's not because of physical weakness, nor is it because of the influence of sound movies. It's just that once during filming, for some reason, he could no longer be directed by his owner. No matter how the owner signaled to him, he wouldn't move. It shows that he has been overworked for years and has to retire from the film industry for a long period of rest. Fortunately, he has a lot of savings in the bank, so he can live a luxurious life in retirement. Soon, he may return to his hometown for a visit.</p>
<h3>A Record of a Benevolent Thief Healing a Patient</h3>
<p>— Tao An</p>
<p>Thieves are hated by the world. Who would have known that there could be someone who transcends the usual norms and conventions as described in this article? Readers might be surprised to think it's a record from overseas. The facts in the article are particularly interesting. Even thieves have principles, as evidenced here.</p>
<p>A certain gentleman in northern Anhui was working in a mine, diligently supervising the workers. One day, while walking around the factory, he accidentally tripped on a stone and bled excessively. He was bedridden and took leave to recuperate, but he did not recover after a long time. Coincidentally, there was a bandit alarm in the countryside, and the factory also suffered misfortune. The bandits were fierce and robbed as they pleased. When they reached his room, the gentleman suddenly got up and stopped them, saying, "Don't do this. I am a poor man. Apart from my sick body, I have nothing else. I am willing to offer my private savings of one hundred and several tens of yuan to you all. Please take it and don't frighten me. Otherwise, I will have no money for medical expenses later." The bandit leader thought for a moment and then generously returned some silver dollars, asking what ailment he suffered from. The gentleman pointed to his wound and explained the reason. The bandit said, "That's not difficult. I'll give you some good medicine." After speaking, he hurriedly left. The next morning, a person in green clothes arrived with a package of medicine. The instructions for treatment were very detailed. He tried applying it, and it worked. The gentleman once told people, "A loss may turn out to be a blessing. To get such good medicine in a remote village is truly good fortune in misfortune."</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "He who steals a hook is executed; he who steals a state becomes a prince." It is also said, "The great thief does not wield swords and spears," and "If the sage does not die, the great thief will not cease." There are many types of thieves. The one described by the gentleman probably belongs to a different category and cannot be compared to others. How can this not be recorded?</p>
<h3>An Examination of Hens Turning into Roosters</h3>
<p>— Xiu Jun</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Fei Gongzhi's article on hens turning into roosters, which is based on science and does not use superstitious language, is very enlightening. The article uses historical examples from the Han, Wei, and Jin dynasties to support its argument, citing them like family treasures. Although the original books are not listed in detail, the source of each reference is verified and based on historical records without any fabrication. This shows the importance of verifying facts, even for trivial matters, and the spirit of studying ancient texts. However, the article does not mention any cases after the Jin dynasty, which is a pity. I would like to add the following:</p>
<p>The "Book of Song, Treatise on the Five Elements" states: "In the twelfth year of the Yuanjia reign (435 AD), a hen in the Hualin Garden turned into a rooster." The "Old Book of Tang, Basic Annals of Empress Wu" states: "In the seventh month of the third year of the Chuigong reign (687 AD), a hen in Jizhou turned into a rooster. In the first month of the first year of the Yongchang reign (689 AD), a hen in Langzhou turned into a rooster. In August, a hen in Songzhou turned into a rooster." The "Jiangnan General Records" states: "In the second year of the Hongzhi reign (1489 AD), a hen in a commoner's house in Wuxian turned into a rooster." The "Ershen Yelu" states: "In the year of Jimao (the fourteenth year of the Zhengde reign, 1519 AD), a hen belonging to the Li Yan family in the western corner of Zhuji turned into a rooster, with a tail two or three feet long, like a brocade ribbon. The comb and feathers were all different." The "Yunnan General Records" states: "In the third year of the Jiajing reign (1524 AD), a hen belonging to the Zeng Ming family in Baoshan County turned into a rooster." The "Guizhou General Records" states: "In the fifteenth year of the Jiajing reign (1536 AD), a hen belonging to a commoner in Jinzhou turned into a rooster." The "Jiangnan General Records" states: "In the thirty-first year of the Jiajing reign (1552 AD), a hen in Jiading County turned into a rooster." The "Henan General Records" states: "In the thirty-ninth year of the Jiajing reign (1560 AD), a hen belonging to the student Qiao Weizhong turned into a rooster." The "Huguang General Records" states: "In the nineteenth year of the Wanli reign (1591 AD), a hen belonging to a commoner in Hengzhou Prefecture turned into a rooster." The "History of Ming, Treatise on the Five Elements" states: "In the sixth month of the twenty-second year of the Wanli reign (1594 AD), a hen belonging to a soldier's family in the Jingbian camp turned into a rooster. In the ninth year of the Chongzhen reign (1636 AD), a hen belonging to a commoner in Huai'an crowed and leaped, turning into a rooster."</p>
<p>In summary, I have included examples up to the late Ming dynasty. As for the Qing dynasty, there must be many such records as well. Unfortunately, the "History of Qing" is not yet completed, and I have few books at home, so I cannot verify them all. In short, when it comes to textual research, the collection of materials should be comprehensive and thorough. How can one impose arbitrary limits and leave out the victorious dynasty? If I have some free time in the future, I will add to it.</p>
<h3>Peony Recipes</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>Peony Crisps: Magnolia flower petals are often used as a side dish in Suzhou restaurants. They are fragrant, crispy, and quite delicious. However, few people know that peony flowers can also be used as food. The method is to mix fresh peony petals with Xingping crisps and fry them in oil. Dip them in white sugar to eat. The taste is also exquisite and beautiful, not inferior to magnolia flower petals.</p>
<p>Peony Tea: Tea is for quenching thirst. However, bad tea leaves often make one more thirsty. Use peony petals to make tea. It is sweet, fragrant, cool, and thirst-quenching, and the color is bright and beautiful, making it especially enjoyable to appreciate. The petals must be picked the year before, pickled in sugar, and stored in a tin can for a year before they can be used. A guest gave me some, so I know about it.</p>
<h3>What I Heard About the Bandit Situation</h3>
<p>— Ren Peichu</p>
<p>Our Wujiang borders Taihu Lake and is often invaded by lake bandits. In the past, the bandits were weak and not a major problem. Since the Qi-Lu War, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway has been the site of battles for many years, and deserters have gathered in Taihu Lake. As a result, the bandits have become increasingly rampant. Last year, they even formed a group, calling themselves an army, and extorted and robbed various districts of Wujiang, leaving the people unable to sleep peacefully. Yesterday, I returned home and was told about the bandit situation by relatives and friends. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>Negotiating for Military Expenses: Luxu is a small market town. At the end of last year, it was robbed by bandits, and many children and strong men were kidnapped. Those who were poor and unable to pay the ransom were all killed. The situation was very tragic. On the 30th of last month, the bandits came again. The residents were like frightened birds, quickly closing their doors and remaining silent. Surprisingly, this time the bandits were very polite and did not use any forceful means. After arriving, they negotiated with the police station to borrow 30,000 yuan to cover military expenses. They also produced a letter of appointment from a certain party, claiming to be a formal army. They promised to return the 30,000 yuan after receiving military expenses from the certain party in the future. After much negotiation, the matter was settled with 2,500 yuan.</p>
<p>Dr. Lin Has Great Luck: There is a Western-style doctor named Lin Zhiqin in Lili Town, who initially had no great reputation. At the beginning of last month, Dr. Lin took 500 yuan on a boat to Suzhou to buy medicine. On the way, they encountered bandits, and the entire boat was robbed. Dr. Lin was not spared. The bandits saw that he had a lot of money and asked him what he did for a living. Dr. Lin replied that he was a doctor. The bandits were pleased and immediately pulled him onto their boat and took him to their den, treating him very respectfully. They asked him to treat two bandits who were sick. Within three days, the bandits recovered. As a result, they treated him even more warmly and gave him 50 yuan as a gift. They let him return home. A few days later, the bandits came to Lili again and asked the police station for Dr. Lin's address. The police station said that there were several doctors named Lin in Lili and asked if they knew Dr. Lin's full name. They said no. At that time, another doctor, Mr. Ling Ganbo, was sipping tea in a tea shop. He heard that the bandits had arrived and were looking for Dr. Lin. Because Lin and Ling sound similar, he mistakenly thought they were going to kidnap him. He hurried home and fell on the way, causing his head to bleed. It was not until the bandit leader described Dr. Lin's appearance that they realized they were looking for Lin Zhiqin. Because Dr. Lin had already had one experience of entering the bandits' den, he was not afraid. He followed the bandits onto the boat and treated five bandits, earning 100 yuan in consultation fees. A few days later, the bandits recovered, and the bandit leader came to thank him. As a result, Dr. Lin's name became famous.</p>
<h3>Two Spring Exhibitions of the Wang Family</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>(1) Mr. Wang Gang's Pattern Exhibition will be held from April 4th to 7th at the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association on Tibet Road. There will be 200 paintings, all carefully designed and focused on practical use. This is rare in the country. Mr. Wang is from Wuxi, Zhejiang. He studied pattern design in Tokyo for many years. He is gentle and kind. He has just returned from Tokyo. He also excels at traditional Chinese painting. It is said that because the venue is small, only pattern paintings will be displayed this time.</p>
<p>(2) Mr. Wang Jiyuan's Painting Exhibition will be held from April 10th to 14th, also at the Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association on Tibet Road. There will be over a hundred pieces, large and small, including ink paintings, watercolors, oil paintings, and pastel paintings, blending Chinese and Western styles into one. This is a special memorial for Mr. Wang's trip to Europe. Advance tickets are being sold at a discount to allow friends to select their favorite pieces during the exhibition. Mr. Wang is a famous contemporary painter. His works are highly respected by the art circles in Japan and China. His trip to Europe will surely bring a unique brilliance to the Eastern art scene.</p>

<h3>A Record of the New York International House Welcoming Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>— Yang Linzhi</p>
<p>On March 2nd, 1920, I was traveling in New York, and the Chinese playwright Mei Lanfang was also traveling in America, being welcomed by Americans. That day, I met a Mr. Huang from Qingtian, Zhejiang, in New York. He told me that there would be a grand reception at the New York International House that evening to welcome Mei Lanfang. So I took the subway to go. I am writing a simple report to inform my fellow countrymen. I believe that readers will be happy to hear about it.</p>
<p>On the evening of March 2nd, Americans, admiring Mr. Mei's fame, specially held a welcoming party to see Mr. Mei's demeanor. The venue was borrowed from the New York International House, and the decoration was very exquisite. The security was also quite tight. The large number of people who attended showed the enthusiasm of the Americans for Mr. Mei. I drove there, and there was no space left in the venue. Besides the approximately one hundred Chinese people present, the rest were all Americans. If I had not been offered a seat by Mr. Pan Shao'e, I would have been afraid of wasting my trip. After waiting until the scheduled time for the welcoming party, Mr. Mei had not yet arrived. To relieve the boredom of the audience, the chairwoman, a certain lady, invited a certain Chinese lady to sing. The lady was dressed in Chinese clothes and was only ten years old. She was composed and sang a scene from "Mulian Saves His Mother," which was highly praised by the audience. The applause was deafening. Then, she sang a Fengyang folk song to thank the audience for their applause. However, Mr. Mei had still not arrived. Then, Mr. Xiong, the Consul General in New York, arrived. The chairwoman immediately invited him to speak. Mr. Xiong could not refuse and stood up to give a speech. He briefly said that Mr. Mei had specially come to your country for sightseeing. It is a great honor to have your compatriots hold a welcoming party. Mr. Mei originally planned to perform for two weeks and then return to China. Now, because of repeated requests from all walks of life, he has agreed to continue performing for a few days. The drama of our country is completely different from the drama of your country. But the audience was able to understand Mr. Mei's drama, which was completely unexpected. I found that the theater tickets are only sold for three dollars and eighty-five cents. But some people buy them and resell them for twelve dollars, and they are still not available. It can be said that the situation is extremely popular. Yesterday, when the news of the extension was released, the theater seats were already sold out. A friend asked me to book three seats for him, but I could not fulfill his request. I am very happy that the drama of our country is so warmly welcomed by your compatriots. Then, a certain American lady spoke about how the performance of Chinese opera was so orderly, which was rare. At this moment, Mei Lanfang arrived. The audience was like seeing clouds and rainbows after a long drought. The atmosphere in the entire venue changed. The chairwoman introduced Mr. Mei to the audience. Mr. Mei spoke in Chinese, which was translated by Mr. Zhang. He said that he was delayed because he did not know the way, so he was late. He apologized for making everyone wait. Today's venue is the International House, which is a place where international knowledge gathers. I came to America to seek knowledge and dare not say that I represent the art of our country. But I will offer my personal gains to your compatriots and hope for your guidance. Because I do not know the language, there are many barriers. I hope you will forgive me. After Mr. Mei finished speaking, the audience applauded greatly. Then, Mr. Zhang explained Chinese drama, such as "Holding the Whip as Riding." The meeting ended. It was already past ten o'clock. When the meeting was over, Mr. Mei had the difficulty of saying goodbye. Some of the audience shook hands with Mr. Mei, and others asked Mr. Mei to sign his name as a souvenir. When I left the meeting, Mr. Mei was still surrounded and could not escape. There is one more thing to tell the people of our country. The women who attended that evening were mostly dressed in Chinese clothes, which were bright and dazzling, not inferior to American clothes. I hope that our compatriots will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (166)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: Red Flames Soar, Hooked Balcony Admires Filial Daughter, Red Carpet Lies on the Ground, Instant Meeting with Famous Actors</p>
<p>When the day for the play came, the Qingliu Society sent Zuo Shichen several tickets and enclosed a letter, politely asking him to provide guidance on everything. Therefore, Zuo Shichen had arranged with Ruiyun in advance and explained it to the Grand Aunt, saying that he wanted to ask her to give Ruiyun a night off. If there were any hall songs to be sung, please send someone else to stand in. The Grand Aunt said, "It's a rare thing for your Second Young Master to invite her to see a play. Let her be happy for a day. For ordinary hall songs, I can ask Fengyun and Hanyun to stand in. But if the station ticket specifically states that she must go in person, it would be bad to offend the guests. In that case, we would have to ask for a stand-in. Anyway, just sit for a while and then come back to the theater." Ruiyun was unhappy when she heard this, saying, "Then I'd rather not go to the play. Hall songs coming in at one moment, Hall songs coming in at another moment. What's the point?" Zuo Shichen winked at her, saying, "Let them stand in. Anyway, we'll only ask for a stand-in if the station ticket specifically states that she must go in person." The play was scheduled to start at 7:30 that day, and the location wasn't far away. It was at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, tucked away in an alley. People who had never been there wouldn't know that there was a theater inside. That day, Ruiyun didn't take her own carriage. She brought Ajin, and together with Zuo Shichen, they hired three rickshaws and went to the theater of the Moutrie Piano Company. As soon as they entered, they met the ushers of the Qingliu Society, who had a white rose pinned to their chest and a pink ribbon underneath, which read "Qingliu Society Usher." Zuo Shichen showed them the tickets in his hand. One of the ushers recognized him and said, "Are you Mr. Zuo? Please follow me." It turned out that although their theater was small, it was laid out like a foreign theater. The seats inside all had numbers. The numbers on the tickets matched the numbers on the seats. It wasn't like the old Chinese theaters, where people sat in a disorderly manner, grabbing seats. No matter what seat they grabbed, even if it was reserved for someone else, they would refuse to give it up. Even those who had reserved seats had no sense of order. In some theaters, they relied on a few ushers. If there were no familiar ushers, you wouldn't be able to get good seats. There were no ushers here. You just found your seat number according to your ticket, and there wouldn't be any confusion. Also, in the old theaters at that time, men and women sat separately, as if men and women sitting together would immediately lead to something scandalous, immediately giving them the opportunity to flirt. But in the main hall of the theater, men and women sat separately, while in the boxes, men and women didn't sit separately. If you asked the theater, they couldn't explain the reason. But in this theater, men and women sat together. At that time, it was considered very modern.</p>
