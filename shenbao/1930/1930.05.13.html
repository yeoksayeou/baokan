<p>時評</p>
<h3>倫敦海會之返響</h3>
<p>倫敦海軍縮减會議自三國協約成立後可謂有一部分之成功矣然其成功後之返響在日則有軍人派之反對在英則有保守黨之反對在美則有參議院之反對在簽訂三協約之國内均有不滿之聲而三國以外之法意二國不但軍縮未成且因此而有漸起糾紛之勢觀法國近日之議論及意國首相今日咄咄逼人之演說可以知今後歐洲海爭之情形矣</p>
<p>人類之心理往往有爭强好勝及懷疑懼禍之两種足以醖釀大小戰爭而不息蓋爭强好勝决不甘居人後并欲佔人之前人人盡存此念則競爭自烈而戰禍即不能不生反之而自甘退讓者又恐爲他人勢力所壓迫不能自保致有覆亡之懼遂亦不得不勉自前進以求生存故對於戰爭之前提不過爲求尊榮與保危亡之二說而由軍備之不能减縮而益增加者亦不過以是求尊榮與保危亡二說爲藉口所以國際之間與一國之中每經大戰之後雖時時有减縮軍備之議而終不易成功者胥由於是也</p>

<p>男子選手勝復旦</p>
<p>鐘鳴三下男子開始交鋒選手隊集各地精華實力之强因無容記者多　復旦乃一校之雄兵雖稱雄江南卒非選手之敵且該隊重心曹廷贊亦爲中華隊服務故第一局中復旦處處受壓迎架爲難遑論進攻上半時爲十一比二下半局選手隊鋒芒益盛復旦一籌莫展結果選手隊以二十一比二勝第二局選手隊中堅曹廷贊與丘廣變二人調入復旦隊中形勢遂較平均惟因缺聨絡方面及救球能力復旦遂又以十一比二十一敗北雙方陣線如下</p>

<h3>麝香清癯</h3>
<p>麝香爲吾國醫藥上重要之貴品然麝之爲物産自喜馬拉亞山及阿爾泰山之積雪處而西藏四川皆有之雲　　記奇疾二則·伯·明</p>
<p>博習醫院爲蘇州首屈一指之西式大醫院凡鄰縣之病者皆來診療之　茲記疾二則以告讀者</p>
<p>（一）六十四磅半之大瘤寳應一少婦腹中生一大瘤望之如孕婦然旣來院即施手術先後割出瘤肉一大盆權之得六十四磅半亦可云空前之大瘤矣　　（二）小孩腹下生五官本城某氏之子今年二歲其腹下生眼耳口鼻外蒙透明之薄皮特求該院割治此孩生有雙料面目亦屬罕聞研究生理者諒知之歟南亦爲出産藥材之一頗資以爲利考麝說文云「如小麋臍有香一名射父」爾雅釋獸則謂「麝父　足」字林曰「小鹿有香其足似　故云　足」字彚注「獸如小麋身有虎豹之文臍有香爲人所迫即自投高巖舉爪剔出其香就縶且死猶供四足保其臍故象退齒犀退角麝退香皆輒掩覆知其珍也」今余聞之自滇中來者見麝形似鹿唯路小耳毛作灰褐色頸長頭小腹部及足爲青白色尾極短而蹄則尖長與載籍所云無異惜前人不言其出處也</p>
<p>據云麝之雌者無香唯雄者臍之下部生一腺囊其腋時時分泌而其香可聞諸四野故獵者往往以嗅覺所及尋其蹤跡焉顧麝恒處於山林菁密叢莽之地窟穴而居盡伏夜動故得之不易近歲捕者愈多而其物愈少價之昻貴由於出品不多而輸之於外人亦其一因每歲運至廣東及上海者皆藏以木箱間有贋鼎者入其中非有鑒别之識力者必至墮其玄中而不自知每箱約十枚或多至二十餘枚苟非僞品則以産自滇中者爲最較之來自日本東京者不及多矣</p>
<p>其物形圓而如一囊約重三十瓦外有細毛色略黑而短周圍微白中貯麝香狀如顆粒而有極芳烈之性剌人鼻觀然驟嗅之則似有奇臭如阿摩尼亞斯其所以異也其粒或謂之「當門子」幹作塊狀者研之即成粉末發生異香惟忌乾燥或與樟腦硫黄等接觸即失其固有之性若遇潤混之氣則又回復其本來故善於保藏者雖歷數十年而其香可不散且愈濃厚焉</p>

<h3>昨晨外跨塘貨車互撞</h3>
<p>分路夫打瞌睡疏忽司機人開車也太快站長告警巳經莫及所幸撞後損失尙微</p>
<p>昨晨四時二十六分京滬路第三十九次上行及第三十四次下行两貨車在外跨塘車站互撞幸無鉅大傷害損失交通亦未阻斷茲將互撞始末詳紀於後</p>
<p>分路夫打瞌睡昨晨（十二）四時三十分第三十九次上行貨車於駛抵外跨塘站後向例在該站停留待與由京開滬之第三十二次貨車交換昨晨第三十九次上行貨車照例先進外跨塘站在灣道内停留後未幾第三十二次下行發車即由蘇州開出於四時十分左右由直綫經過該站但第三十四次下行貨車昨晨並未脫班故於三十二次車經過外跨塘後即由蘇站長向外跨塘站電索路簽將該車放至外跨塘站仍與三十九次上行貨車交車外跨塘站長於發給蘇站路簽後即照例用燈號通知東西两分路夫扳放直道詎料西首分路夫某意爲三十二次貨車經過後第三十九次貨車例須放至蘇站故將車道扳放灣道本人即在分路棚内瞌睡所有警號燈號等均未之見</p>
<p>站長補救不及時該站站長見西分路夫並無回號即亟派站役前往察看同時將該站西首内外揚旗仍置危險號誌俾來車司機人見而停車但該第三十四次貨車昨晨車行速度似較往常爲快當站役正行在中途間該車巳不及停車而冲進灣道與三十九次車互撞車上司機人急忙閉汽塞住故撞勢尙輕時正上午四時二十六分也</p>
<p>車務人員踏勘該站站長見两車肇事後立即急電上海北站告警並請派救險車前往救險滬站接電後立即通知各領袖前往查察並設法救險該路車務副總管鄭寳照東段夜班車務稽查黎松柏晃段車務稽查楊效曾及吳淞工廠主任慕爾惠車務總段長滬段工程同等聞訊後立即到站偕乘救險車至外跨塘站於上午七時卅二分開出北站</p>
<p>損失尙屬輕徵各處領袖於抵外跨塘站後即從事調查肇禍原由及損失一面設法清路見第三十九次車最前一輛四十噸蓬車第五九五號前後車鈎巳斷車皮稍有損失第三十四交貨車最前两輛三十噸蓬車第六四號及二三八號前後車鈎亦均巳撞斷两機車亦稍受損毁餘外均未波及道路榨木等亦無恙　　夜車因此誤點當時京來夜客車巳駛抵蘇站因得悉前站巳肇禍乃祗得將此車在蘇暫扣等候一面即將該客車上機車解下放至外跨塘站將第三十四次貨車後部車輛拖至蘇站重將該機車再接上夜車經外跨塘站直道開行來滬故昨晨該車抵滬巳誤去二小時</p>
<p>救險車之工作所有撞斷車鈎各車由救險車將未波及者先行調開後乃啣接拖滬两機車就隨後送往吳淞廠修理該站灣道於下午三時巳完全出清通行無阻各客車均照常暢行並未有甚阻滯及遲誤救救險車及該路各處領袖均於下午乘車回滬</p>
<p>關係人之責行該路車務副總管鄭寳照於事後曾即在外跨塘站召集各關係人在站訊問據聞此事該站分道夫及第三十九次貨車司機人均應分任其咎蓋分路夫雖在值公時偷懶貪睡致誤公事但三十四次貨車司機人不應不遵守信號衝進車站况照時刻上規定貨車由蘇州開至外跨塘站須二十六分而昨晨該車由蘇至外跨塘站祗有十七分則其加快速度亦未始不肇禍之一因也</p>

<h3>峇里人的廟會毛月文</h3>
<p>峇里是小巽他羣島中最接近爪哇的一小島這島上的人和全南洋各島的土人最不同的一點就是他們對於宗敎是取寛容態度的婆羅門敎傅到爪哇時這島上也就有了婆羅門的神廟等到回敎代替了婆羅門敎時峇里人也一樣歡迎他最後基督敎隨了白人白的威力侵到這島上來時也毫無障碍地存在着這樣說來峇里人對於任何宗敎都信仰嗎决不峇里人自有其固有的習俗和信仰任何宗敎都不能動摇他們的信仰可貴的就是他們絶無和其他民族那樣的仇視異敎的心理他們往往把各敎安置在自己的神壇旁邊崇奉起來這樣博大的寛容是任何民族所無的吧</p>
<p>峇里人以爲峇里這一個地方一切都是由神統治着神是一切人事與快樂的泉源神是各種幸边的掌握者也是一切權力的源頭在神的勢力之下處處地方都獻給了神種種工作都是爲着神　　所以每座大山與小山大洋的灘岸海潮水樹林甚至每株樹與每個村落每所宮室與房子每所田園與墓地都有着神廟對任何人都公開着神廟的屋頂便是蒼碧光芒的天空天空底下樹兒們長年不息地吐放着花兒微風輕柔地嘆息着這樣幽美和平的熱帶的水鄉把文化落後的峇里人輕輕地籠罩在神秘而和悅的網下了</p>
<p>現在要來說一說峇里人的廟會了這是一個豪華的神會他的慈祥莊嚴美麗往往使外來所人吃驚·讚嘆因爲每個外來的人决没有想到會在這里遇到那樣富麗而和愛的神會</p>
<p>當峇里人舉行廟會的時節不用說所有廟宇都十分富麗的裝璜起來這裏特有的銅鼓的音響一齊勇壯地敲打起來這時節凡綠蔭下的路上都可看見穿着絲綢外衫佩着金首飾的女人們跣着足成羣結隊蜿蜒着走　廟宇去她們的頭上各自頂着一個托　鮮花與菓品精巧地裝在裹面遠望去這一羣人就好像阿刺比亞故事裹所描寫的天女一樣美麗到人間想像以上她們的這些祭品堆起來時往往高到七尺重到要三個人才可以抬得起可是頂在她們的古銅色的頭上時似乎没事一般慈祥而莊嚴的走動着所有的祭品都堆在一個竹架子上最多的是各色各樣的華美的米糕上面安插着各種香花豐麗的氣分顯現出峇里人由心底裏湧出來的愉悅與虔敬　　峇里的廟宇通常都只有三進院子空着第一進是開着的廟門第二進盡是集會的長條凳第三進才是祈禱的地方神壇便建在這裏女人們一進頭門便將祭品拿下來放在竹架上祭品取齊之後她們於是走進壇内那時壇内的柱子上都巳裝點着鮮花葉氣象莊麗馨香馥郁白衣的廟祝從她們的手上接下特别供奉壇内的祭品安放在壇的四周銅鼓的音響停了她們都跪下去祈禱起來這時天色向晚了她們棕色的背映在微茫的暮色中眞是一幅無雙的美景　　她們一面祈禱一面輕柔的唱着讚美歌白衣僧人捧首一個長頸的金瓶慈祥地走到他們的面前佈施聖水她們接到了雖然是僅有少許的一滴便用來洗她們的頭額嘴唇和手於是她們的頭俯下去將手伸出來各人取了一朶聖花跑在旁邊的好們的孩子們注意地看着並倣傚着没有一個不靜穆地虔敬地倣傚着這可愛而敏活的重作要令人感動到流感激之涙在她們之後便是男子們他們都光着頭行着同樣的禮式再後便是貴族的女人們好們的頭上都插着花兒两手捧着祭品平肩的舉着最後是村長和他的下屬由僧人們的手上接受聖水廟會第一段便是這樣結束了　　僧人走回廟裏安排好那許多祭品在壇前祈禱着請神們降臨來享受人民的敬意獻過之後婦人們仍將祭品帶回家去吃等到全村的祭品都巳吃過之後於是銅鼓又響起來了大家又應聲而齊集於廟裏這時廟裏的第一二两進都點着通明的燈與火把村的中不幸如發生了瘟疫死了很多人村民們便要在這晚上决定哀求神的帮僵那立刻就要把慈祥和悅的情景轉變到令人可怕的另一個塲面他們在神廟的庭中擺一個可憎可怕的死神的塑像軀體粗大穿着白的衣服龐大的頭上披着厚厚的長髮深而且黑眼窟閃閃的發着光撩牙伸出口外長長的舌頭一直垂到地上好像正在甜着血他們慢慢的將這死神移動使它看看四圍的病者以緩和它無饜的噬慾赤裸裸的小孩們披着頭髮喝了烈酒發狂一般的圍着它跳舞每個孩子的右手上都拿一把蛇形的短劍其中的一個忽將劍刺着自巳的胸膛火光之下血流如注於是旁的小孩們給他包裹創口唱着壯烈的歌曲扶那爲大衆而犧牲的小英雄走開去</p>
<p>於是第二個小孩又走近死神將自己當爲犧牲獻給他行着同樣的儀式這時全廟堂中充滿着熱烈的急迫的痴望末了人們的血巳放夠黑暗的死神不再移動了它的两手軟弱地垂着愿心還過了村人的盲目的狂熱算得到了安慰了於是便慢慢的緩和起來銅鼓的音響輕柔地響着一直敲成了悲哭憂傷的聲調昏暗的光中走來了一個老婦人穿着簡單的服裝徐徐的舞着莊嚴的踏着步樂聲停了清肅之中老婦人歌唱起來她的聲音柔和她的音調滿含着憂愁與悲慘衆人輕微地各着有些巳在哭泣僧人跪在壇前朗聲祈禱村人們這才靜悄悄地從黑暗的夜色中向各條路上分散</p>

<p>婦女生活</p>
<h3>往事浮沉彭綠萍</h3>
<p>那是一年前在利祖福尼亞同妹妹寄居在同學蕙蘭姊家裏的事了</p>
<p>是一個夏天的晚上夜神剛剛展開了她幽靜的帳幕一顆圓白如銀的玉盤便升上了東方的雲際暗藍色的沉靜的天幔烘染於她底周圍越顯出她底晶瑩她底光芒她底悄然的風度熌灼的星斗俊巡着她底邊傍似乎更加顯出她美麗的不可一世的耀武揚威底氣概一陣陣的海風從西方吹來使人感受着一種特别的凉爽和快意</p>
<p>吃過了晚飯以後我便同妹妹蕙蘭姊三個人在這幕着美麗的月夜銀靄中乘一葉的扁舟於附近的NC湖面清輝的月色照耀着微波蕩漾的湖水閃焔着如錯雜萬片的銀鱗啞啞的牀槳聲摇曳着像更深午夜落雁的低鳴</p>
<p>蕙姊緩緩提起了她的Mendolin彈着當時風行的雷夢娜妹妹便撥開了她嘹亮的歌喉依聲和着她抑揚動聽的音波在那肅靜沉默的空氣裏眞是清幽出世</p>
<p>舟抵湖心時我便停着摇槳任舟身獨自飄浮微波鮮鱗的水面此時便漸漸平靜起來星光月影便在這如鏡的水面重復浮現出來了</p>
<p>蕙蘭姊和妹妹此時亦放下了她們的琴歌們便在這充滿着極端沉寂和幽靜的空氣中任意互相談些有趣的故事和希奇的神話但有時却又各自呆呆地仰望着沉靜的天空看那迷茫淡淡的天河看那熌灼着的點點的繁星看那熌媚娉婷的月亮有時又各自灣着腰兒俯視着那各人糢糊的倒影去掬那晶瑩明潔的湖水那時候我們的心情呀眞如雨後的青天微塵不染</p>
<p>一刻間我們復鼓槳輕摇摇來摇去不覺巳至蘆葦深處當時忽有一對美國的年青女郎亦乘着一葉小舟從我們前面駛過她們亦用着嘹亮和諧的聲音唱着抑掦動聽的清歌餘音嫋嫋繚繞在蘆狄間忽有一二夜鳥從中撲刺刺地飛起妹妹不禁驚惶着躺到我的胸膛來舟身亦便因之震運擺摇但過後又只覺夜靜天清萬籟無聲那時候我們的身境眞如離開了惡濁混沌的社會進了另一番清幽靜寂的世界</p>
<p>摇槳復摇槳談心復談心歌唱復歌唱直至更闌人靜敎堂傅來一片二片若斷若續的鐘聲時纔興盡棄掉而返　　自從那次夜遊了以後幾日間我便偕着妹妹回到自己的家中來以後時時都想再到回那個地方去玩玩但爲着種種的原因終未能如願現在現在是更没有機會了我巳經是同到萬里重洋的祖國來了唉那個不能忘懷的美麗的幽靜的NC湖何時纔能得到機會再去同她重温舊日底歡情呢</p>

<h3>Yan Feng's Attitude Towards the Party</h3>
<p>Lu Weigan and Xie Chi's Discussions: Various Factions in Beiping Hold a Preliminary Meeting Today</p>
<p>Various important party figures in Beiping are scheduled to hold a preliminary meeting at the Litong Hotel tomorrow. (Special telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>Tan Zhen, fearing that a statement issued by the Central Supervisory Committee might be inconsistent with the original agreement in Tianjin, telegraphed Wang Jingwei again on the evening of the 11th, stating that a joint statement would be sufficient to express unity.

<p>Lu Weigan and Xie Chi hosted reporters at Xie's residence in Fangsheng Hutong today. Lu said that at the Zhengzhou meeting, Yan was solely responsible for raising funds and political matters, while Feng was responsible for military matters. Regarding politics, it is said that Yan lacks courage. In fact, Yan has always been involved in domestic affairs for the past nineteen years. However, his personal opinion is that the formation of a government should originate from the party, and Yan will allow party members to resolve party affairs themselves. He personally will not interfere. The fact that Shang Zhen and Xue Dubi did not come to Beiping this time is an implication of Yan Feng's attitude towards the party. Once the party affairs are completely resolved, they can come to Beiping at any time. Xie Chi said that after the Zhengzhou meeting, all generals would consult Feng on operational strategies, and Yan himself stated that he would not interfere in party affairs. Even if someone asked Yan about the party, Yan would not answer. Yan would obey the party in the organization of the government. Regarding party affairs, the three parties in Tianjin, Beiping, and Jin exchanged opinions this time. Chen Gongbo accommodated the Guangzhou Second Session members, while he himself proposed the Shanghai Second Session. It is now scheduled to meet with Chen, Wang, Bai, etc. formally tomorrow to exchange opinions.

<h3>Repercussions of the London Naval Conference</h3>
<p>The London Naval Disarmament Conference can be said to be somewhat successful since the establishment of the Triple Entente. However, the repercussions of its success include opposition from military factions in Japan, the Conservative Party in Britain, and the Senate in the United States. There are voices of dissatisfaction within the countries that signed the Triple Entente, and the two countries outside the Triple Entente, France and Italy, have not only failed to achieve disarmament but have also gradually developed disputes as a result. Judging from the recent discussions in France and the compelling speeches made by the Italian Prime Minister today, the future of naval disputes in Europe can be foreseen.</p>
<p>Human psychology often includes both a desire to compete and a fear of danger, which are sufficient to brew large and small wars without ceasing. The desire to compete means never being content with lagging behind and always wanting to be ahead. If everyone holds this belief, competition will naturally intensify, and war cannot be avoided. Conversely, those who are willing to yield fear being oppressed by the power of others and unable to protect themselves, leading to the fear of destruction. Consequently, they are forced to move forward to seek survival. Therefore, the premise for war is nothing more than the pursuit of honor and the protection from danger. The reason why military preparations cannot be reduced and instead increase is nothing more than using the pursuit of honor and the protection from danger as an excuse. Therefore, international relations and relations within a country, after a major war, although there are discussions on reducing military preparations from time to time, are ultimately unsuccessful due to these reasons.</p>

The general idea is that county magistrates must strictly prohibit human trafficking, arrest those who have been sold and return them to their families, establish disaster relief shelters for the victims, provide food and teach them handicrafts, and provide farmers with seeds and use military horses to cultivate the fields. However, even with a hundred orders, it will not be effective in this wilderness. The price of infants ranges from two or three yuan to seven or eight yuan, and the price of girls aged twelve or thirteen ranges from ten to twenty yuan. It is no less than a hell on earth, yet there are still no buyers, and more than 200,000 people have starved to death.</p>

<p>International News. Gandhi's Successor</p>
<h3>Detained En Route</h3>
<p>"No Freedom, No Peace"</p>
<p>A document issued last night informed the whole country that the atmosphere in Surat was again bleak.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, November 12th. After Gandhi, the leader of non-violent resistance, Diya Baiji, and fifty-seven volunteers who were to attack the Dharasana salt factory on Thursday, were arrested by armed police this morning on their way from Surat to Dharasana, at Nadi Sarali. Diya Baiji, who is over eighty years old, is a Muslim leader. Knowing that he would be arrested by the military police, he issued a document last night informing the whole country: "There is no peace without freedom. Keep the national flag flying!" Reuters, Jalalpur, November 11th. The governor of the Surat district sent a letter to Gandhi's successor, Diya Baiji, warning him that his plan to occupy the private salt factory in Dharasana on Thursday was illegal and that the government would use its power to prevent it. Diya Baiji replied to thank the governor for his warning but said that the procedure could not be changed. The police are now gathering here to be on guard, and the Dharasana salt factory has been surrounded by barbed wire.</p>
<p>Reuters, Surat, November 11th. The atmosphere here seems bleak and bad again. More soldiers came to Pune today, and there are now eight hundred soldiers here. Shops and factories are still closed. Some shops plan to open today, but factory workers are preventing them because the factories have not yet resumed operation, and it is not appropriate for shops to open first. Given the current situation, it is very dangerous for factories to resume operation, especially those set up by Europeans.</p>
<p>From Mussolini's Mouth</p>
<h3>Italian Maritime Hegemony</h3>
<p>Whoever obstructs Italy in the future, the whole country will rise up and fight against them.</p>
<p>Reuters, La Spezia, November 11th. Italian dictator Mussolini, after inspecting the new cruiser Gorizia today, addressed 30,000 people, asking the audience, "Black shirt comrades, how is your pulse?" The crowd replied, "Steady! We will follow your words until death!" Mussolini also asked, "People of La Spezia, whose sea is this?" The crowd shouted, "Our sea!" Mussolini then said that what Italy wants is not only prosperity but also dignity and a place in the sun. Whoever obstructs Italy in the future, no matter who they are or where they are, the Italian people will all rise up and fight them!</p>
<h3>Japanese New 10,000-Ton Cruiser Launched</h3>

<h3>The U.S. Ambassador to Japan Has Not Been Decided</h3>
<p>Those with talent and knowledge often see Japan as a daunting path.</p>
<p>U.S. United Press, Washington, November 11th. The U.S. government feels that the selection of an ambassador to Japan is very difficult, partly because of the Senate's attitude and partly because many people with the appropriate talent and knowledge are unwilling to go to Japan. It is said that President Hoover has long been interested in Washington, the current minister to Austria, but Washington died suddenly. In addition, Hope Kirk, the current director of the Far East Division, seems unwilling to be posted abroad for personal reasons. As for Keiser, the current temporary naval envoy in Japan and Undersecretary of State, his achievements have been highly praised by all parties, but Keiser is also unwilling to change to a permanent appointment because the cost of living in Tokyo is extremely high, the expenses are huge, and the ambassador's duties are heavy and difficult to handle without extraordinary intelligence. However, those who have this talent and are also wealthy are mostly willing to be envoys to major European powers and see Japan as a daunting path.</p>
<h3>British Long-Distance Aviation Business</h3>

<h3>The Number of Unemployed People in Japan is Increasing</h3>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, November 12th. The number of unemployed people in Japan reached 700,000 to 800,000 in mid-March, and has continued to increase rapidly since then due to the failure of small and medium-sized enterprises and the frequent closure of factories. At present, it is at least one million or more.</p>
<p>100-Yard Dash</p>
<h3>Wykoff Creates New Record</h3>
<p>Nine and two-fifths seconds.</p>
<p>Reuters, Los Angeles, November 11th. Olympic runner Wykoff set a new world record in the 100-yard dash here today in nine and two-fifths seconds. In 1906, someone completed the 100-yard dash in nine and three-fifths seconds, and four others have matched it since then, but no one has surpassed it.</p>
<h3>Recent Survey of Students Studying in the United States</h3>
<p>There has been a large decrease in Chinese and Filipino students, and Japanese and Korean students have almost doubled.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, November 11th. According to the authorities' survey of the number of foreign students studying in the United States in the past two years, compared with the two years of 1921 and 1922, the number of Chinese students has decreased significantly. In the past two years, only 948 people have come to the United States, while in the previous session there were 1,251 people. On the contrary, the number of Korean and Japanese students has almost doubled. However, the number of Filipino students has also decreased like the Chinese, from 850 to 594. According to Dr. Duggan of the International Education Board, the reasons for the decrease in Chinese students going to the United States in recent years are due to four reasons: domestic unrest, poverty of provincial governments, improved reputation of self-run schools, and Chinese students wanting to have some foundation in the country before going to the United States.</p>

<p>From Xuzhou to Jinan. Jinan Correspondent. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government came north from Nanjing to inspect the troops stationed along the Jinpu Line.

It was reported that Chiang's party departed from Xuzhou at 10:20 a.m. on the 9th and arrived in Yanzhou at 3:30 p.m. that afternoon. He immediately transferred to Jining to inspect the defense and review the troops stationed in western Shandong.

<h3>News Continued</h3>
<p>Earlier, after Chiang departed from Jining, Chen Diaoyuan departed from Jining at 11:20 p.m. on the 9th and returned to Jinan. At 3:20 a.m. on the 10th, he passed through Tai'an and had a brief talk with Ma Hongkui. He arrived in Jinan at 5:55 a.m. Among those welcoming him at the station were He Siyuan, Zhu Xi, Yu En, Chen Luanshu, Chen Mingyu, Cui Shijie, Yuan Jiapu of the Provincial Committee, Li Erkang, Chief of Staff of the Headquarters, Bai Yushan, Adjutant General, Shi Zhongcheng, Commander of the Garrison, Zhao Jingshi, Mayor of Jinan, Li Yue, Director of the Public Security Bureau, and Chu Fengzhang, Special Commissioner of the Ministry of Finance in Shandong. Chen did not get off the train but invited the leaders to board the train to discuss the military situation in western Shandong while waiting for Chiang to arrive in Jinan. Before long, Han Fuju, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Corps, He Yaozu, Chief of Staff of the National Government, Jiang Bocheng, Chief of Staff, Sun Tongxuan, Commander of the Twelfth Army, Cao Fulin, Commander of the Fourteenth Army, Zhao Yibang, Director of the Jinan Arsenal, and representatives of various mass organizations from the Provincial Restructuring Committee and the Municipal Restructuring Committee, as well as representatives of various agencies, also arrived at the station one after another. The station, inside and outside, as well as along the road to the city, were heavily guarded by the military police, and traffic was completely cut off. No one was allowed to pass or enter the station unless they had a blue and yellow temporary pass issued by the General Reserve Team Headquarters of the Anti-Rebel Army. At 7:15, Ge Jingen, Special Mayor of Qingdao, also arrived in Jinan to welcome Chiang. At 8:30, the Taiping armored train arrived in Jinan first, and Chiang's special train followed at 9:10. Accompanying Chiang were Shao Lizi, Zhou Fohai, Cao Haosen, Sun He'gao, and a battalion of guards. The special train had a total of fifteen cars, including a No. 262 locomotive, three first-class steel cars, four first-class sleeping cars, one second-class car, two third-class cars, and four boxcars. Chiang, wearing a yellow military uniform, got off the train and exchanged greetings with the leaders. Amidst the sound of military music, he took a car with Han Fuju, Chen Diaoyuan, etc. to the headquarters of the First Army Corps to discuss defense matters and summon the officers for a brief speech. At 11:00, he went to the provincial government in the city for lunch and summoned the generals for a briefing to discuss Shandong's defense. In the afternoon, he took a car with Han Fuju, Chen Diaoyuan, etc. to Xinzhuang and Zhangzhuang to inspect Han's Twelfth Army, Fourteenth Army, and Twenty-second Division, etc. and gave a long speech. It was heard that he was scheduled to return to Xuzhou that evening. The reporter recently met with Shao Lizi. According to Shao, Chiang's visit to the north was purely to inspect the troops and inspect the defense. He inspected the Second Cavalry Division when passing through Bengbu and met with Commander-in-Chief Liu Zhi when passing through Xuzhou. Yesterday afternoon, he went from Yanzhou to Jining for inspection and left Jining to the north that evening. He arrived in Tai'an at 6:00 this morning and inspected Ma Hongkui's troops. That is why he only arrived in Jinan now. This time, the rebel army is willingly taking the lead, and the central government, although holding a lenient attitude, has no choice but to deal with them. It is impossible to determine when the war will end, but it is expected that the rebel army can be suppressed in the near future. Chiang will not stay in Jinan for long and will return south tonight. In addition to consulting with Han and Chen on defense matters, he has no other business. Ma Hongkui also came to Jinan from Tai'an by special train at 10:30 a.m. on the 10th. After getting off the train, he went to the headquarters to meet Chiang to ask for instructions and then returned to Tai'an. (10th)</p>
<p>Another report said that Chiang arrived in Jinan at 9:10 a.m. on the 10th and first went to Han Fuju's headquarters. At 11:00, Chiang, Chen, Han, etc. went to the provincial government for a banquet in the west lane of Pearl Spring. All the commanders, army, division, and brigade commanders, and all members of the provincial government were in attendance. At 12:00, the banquet was over and a group photo was taken. Chiang took a car with Chen Diaoyuan, etc. to visit the Black Tiger Spring and the Three Emperors Temple in the southeast pass. Han Fuju went to Xinzhuang to gather the troops to listen to the inspection, and Ma Hongkui was eager to return to Tai'an for defense, so he did not have time to follow. Only Chen Diaoyuan, Li Jinglin, Jiang Bocheng, He Yaozu, Shao Lizi, etc. followed. After arriving at Black Tiger Spring, they visited for a while and then went to the Thousand Buddha Mountain via the Three Emperors Temple. They got off the car at the foot of the mountain and took mountain sedan chairs to the mountain. They got off the sedan chairs at the Mujifang of Qiyan Jiu Dian and walked to the temple to rest in the north-facing factory. At this time, Chiang leaned on the railing and pointed out the famous scenic spots of Quehua and Daming Lake, looking north at the Yellow River. Chen Diaoyuan talked about Mount Hua, which is the ancient name of the mountain during the Spring and Autumn period, where Duke Qing of Qi fought a great battle with Ke. He also talked about the territories and relics of the ancient states of Qi and Lu. The reporter submitted his business card and asked when the chairman would return to Nanjing. Chiang replied that it was still undecided. He said that the stadium here was very large and that the National Games would be held in Nanjing next year, and it would be best to hold them in Shandong the year after next. After leaving the temple and heading east for about an hour, they took sedan chairs down the mountain and went straight to Jinpu Railway Station to rest. At 4:00, Chiang, Chen Diaoyuan, Jiang Bocheng, He Yaozu, Li Jinglin, etc. took cars to Xinzhuang.</p>
<p>As soon as they arrived outside the camp gate, military music played loudly. Everyone got out of the car and entered the gate. Han Fuju and his army commander Sun Tongxuan and division commander Yu Liangmin came out to greet them, saluted, and reported that the troops to be inspected today included the 529th Brigade and 60th Brigade of the 20th Division, the 87th Brigade of the 29th Division, the 65th Brigade and 66th Brigade of the 22nd Division, and the Armored Car Team, as well as the First Regiment of the First Shandong Supplementary Brigade stationed in Luokou. Due to the short time, they had not been summoned. After the report, they went to the parade hall together. The hall was in the center, facing south. The infantry was on the east and south sides of the parade ground, and the artillery and cavalry were on the west and southwest sides, forming a circle. Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Commander Han, Sun Tongxuan, Chen Diaoyuan, Gu Liangmin, Jiang Bocheng, and He Yaozu all mounted their horses (Li Jinglin did not participate in plain clothes). They first circled the field once and returned to the parade hall. Han followed Chiang's order and ordered the officers above the rank of company commander of each unit to come to listen to the commander-in-chief's instructions. Then, hundreds of officers above the rank of lower-level officers from each unit came to the front of the hall in a running manner. First, Han took the stage to give a brief introduction, and then Chiang took the stage to give a speech. After the speech, Chiang, Chen, etc. took cars back to the station. At 8:10, Chiang hosted a banquet for the officers above the rank of regiment commander in the west flower hall of the provincial government and gave a speech. The banquet ended at 10:00. He discussed the defense of the province with Chen Diaoyuan and Han Fuju. He left for the station at 10:30. All the leaders came to the station to see him off. The security was even tighter at night. After arriving at the station, he summoned Chen Diaoyuan and Han Fuju to the car for a ten-minute talk. Chen, Han, etc. said goodbye and got off the car. At 10:45, the special train left south amidst the sound of military music.</p>
<h3>Chiang and Wang's Party Return to Xuzhou from Jinan</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondent. Chairman Chiang's inspection of the military in the north was completed and he returned to Xuzhou from Jinan by special train at 2:20 p.m. on the 11th. The Taiping armored train still led the way. Liu Zhi, Yang Jie, Jiang Chu'ou, Yu Feipeng, Qian Zongze, etc., as well as local agencies, county magistrates, and public security directors, were all at the station to greet him. When the train stopped at the station, Chiang summoned the generals to board the train for a talk of about two hours.</p>
<p>The central military preparations have long been completed. The battle on the Longhai Line has now begun. All units of the Second Army Corps have arrived at the appropriate locations by today (11th) and are concentrated waiting for the order to attack. The enemy's vanguard is still a mixed force, and the line of defense is still the same. Wan Xuancai's troops are gathered in Guide, the vanguard is in Mamuji, a part of Shi Yousan's troops is still on the left flank in Kaocheng, and a part of Sun Dianying's troops is still on the right flank in Bozhou. Recently, a small part of Wan's troops bypassed Yucheng to attack and have been repelled. A small part of Sun's troops has also had contact with the central army in northern Anhui, and a small part of Shi's troops has also advanced. However, these local contacts are all unrelated to the battle situation. Wan intends to show his allegiance to the central government, and Zhang Fang, the former Director of the Construction Department of Henan, came to Xuzhou via Jinan the day before yesterday to help with the negotiations. Sun's representative is still in Xuzhou to negotiate surrender. Shi has avoided combat and moved elsewhere. Therefore, according to the observation of the central army, there are no major problems with the enemy's vanguard. However, there are three divisions of the Jin army in Lanfeng, which are the troops of Sun Chu, Zhang Hui Zhao, and Guan Fu'an. There may be fierce fighting there.</p>
<h3>Trial Proceedings of Gao Ying's Appeal Case</h3>
<p>The Presiding Judge Announced the End of the Debate, with Sentencing Scheduled for the 17th of this Month</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: The appeal case concerning Gao Ying's suspected involvement in opium trafficking was continued yesterday (the 12th) afternoon at 2 PM in the First Tribunal of the High Court. Despite the rain, there was a large audience, especially from the legal community. The President of the High Court, Lin Biao, was also present in the audience. The Anti-Narcotics Association also sent a representative to observe. Gao Ying and his wife's defense attorneys, Liu Shifang, Wang Youling, and Sun Yuan, and the defense attorneys for the other defendant, Li Zongqian and Hu Zhen, appeared in court. At 1:40 PM, the Presiding Judge, Zhao Yu, (the original Presiding Judge for this case was Huang Bingdao, who is currently on leave), Judges Hu Xiyu and Chen Dafu, Prosecutor Zhu Jun, and Clerk Qin Qijun, etc., arrived at the court. Gao Ying, Gao Liao, and Sun Yuan were brought before the court to state their names and origins. Afterward, Gao Ying and Sun Yuan were ordered to withdraw to the waiting room outside the court. Gao Liao, followed by Gao Ying and Sun Yuan, were then questioned. Finally, the Presiding Judge announced the end of the debate, with sentencing scheduled for 2 PM on the 17th of this month. The following are excerpts from the testimonies and the lawyers' arguments.</p>
<p>Prosecutor: The prosecutor stood up first and stated, in brief, that Gao Ying, Gao Liao, and Sun Yuan all had a certain plan beforehand, dividing the work and cooperating to do this thing. Gao Liao was responsible for transportation, Gao Ying was responsible for the seals, and Sun Yuan was responsible for pick-up and delivery. Therefore, they three should be jointly responsible for this matter. After Sun Yuan's luggage was detained by Customs, he went with Gao Ying to negotiate with Customs. This is even clearer evidence that Sun Yuan had actual involvement in this case. The original judgment that he did not have any involvement is inappropriate, so we are filing this appeal.</p>

Did you only know at this time? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Did they open the boxes on the 8th? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Were the cans inside the boxes the same as in the photos? (The Judge handed a photo to Liao to read) (Answer) Almost like this. (Question) These were all within the eleven pieces. None of your own three pieces? (Answer) Yes.

(Question) According to you, you didn't know there was opium inside until Customs opened the boxes? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Then why did Gao Ying know that there was opium inside as soon as the ship arrived at the dock? Did you tell him first? (Answer) No. (Question) Did you see that Customs detained your things at that time? (Answer) I went home as soon as I landed, so I didn't know at that time. (Question) Then when did you know? (Answer) I knew later. (Question) Gao Ying sent telegrams to Minister Wu on the 5th and 6th, and you sent a telegram to Minister Wu on the 7th, signed Gao Liao Chengqiu. Is that you? (Answer) My name is Liao Chengsu. (Question) Then you knew there were drugs in the box on the 7th? (Answer) I didn't send this telegram. (Question) According to you, you landed on the 5th and didn't know there was opium in the box until Customs opened the box on the 8th? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Also, you didn't know about the letters you were carrying to the drug dealer? (Answer) I only knew on the 8th. (Question) Did you know beforehand that the keys were in your box? (Answer) I only knew on the 8th as well. (Question) According to you, Mr. Chen asked you to carry these letters. Normally, if he asked you to carry eleven pieces of luggage, he should have told you what he was carrying. Even if he didn't explain the contents in detail, he should have at least given a general description. Why didn't you know anything at all? Since you didn't know, why were you willing to be responsible? (Answer) Because Mr. Chen handed it to me through someone else. (Question) Where does Mr. Chen live? (Answer) North Sichuan Road. (Question) We investigated last time, but we couldn't find him. Do you know his detailed address? (Answer) I don't know.</p>
<p>Gao Ying: (The Judge asked) Are you appealing against the first trial for both parts (1) selling opium and (2) bribery? What are your reasons? (Answer) Regarding selling opium, I didn't do anything of the sort. As for introducing passports and promising bribes, I have never had any contact with anyone.

<h3>A Letter of Blood and Tears from All Chinese Merchants in Outer Mongolia</h3>
<p>Russian Soviet Aggression in Outer Mongolia Causes Great Suffering to Chinese</p>
<p>It is our understanding that Mongolia is one of the five ethnic groups of China, and the territory of Outer Mongolia is inherently owned by China. Its area is approximately over six million square miles, with a population of over one million. The vastness and richness of its resources are unmatched by any inland province. It is located in the north of our country, serving as a strong shield against foreign threats and a rich source of production. Having it means a solid foundation for the country and prosperous commerce; losing it means peril and suffering for the people. It is truly the most important territory for our country and the most important key to the northwest. Anyone with common sense knows this. During the 7th and 8th years of the Republic, some government officials who cared about the national economy saw that the natural resources of Outer Mongolia were being wasted. They proposed immigration, land reclamation, mining, and various construction plans. They prepared the Zhangjiakou-Kulun Railway to develop industry and commerce, and they promoted education to spread knowledge among the Mongols and strengthen their internal orientation and consolidate our defenses. For a time, the whole country followed suit, eager to see this happen. However, due to financial constraints and national affairs being in a state of turmoil, it was not implemented. Then, the rapacious Russians, coveting Outer Mongolia, used whale-like swallowing tactics, committing troops and invading Outer Mongolian territory by force, so that the entire region fell into Russian hands. Recently, the Mongolian regime has been looking to the ambitious Red Russians for guidance. The lives and property of us Chinese merchants in Northwest Outer Mongolia are now in a desperate situation. Since Outer Mongolia was lost, ten years have passed, but China has not been heard to have any perfect methods to recover it or provide relief. As a result, the good territory and the northwestern gateway have been abandoned, as if they were not part of our territory. If this continues, not only will hundreds of thousands of Chinese merchants abroad have no place to be buried, but we fear that the Red Russian tide will spread and be difficult to control. We hope that those who care about the national economy and people's livelihood will examine this carefully. We will now briefly describe the political and economic oppression and various acts of aggression suffered by the Chinese in Outer Mongolia, as well as the details of the cruel killings and poisonous tactics.</p>
<p>During the turmoil of the ninth year of the Republic, when the Zhili-Anhui War left the border defenses empty, Semenov of the Russian Empire incited the Living Buddha Jebtsundamba Khutuktu of Outer Mongolia to declare independence. The Mongolians in Hölön responded, and our border defense forces initially resisted the enemy, but were eventually defeated by internal and external attacks. At that time, the Chinese scattered like birds and beasts, following the troops of Gao Zaitian south. The farmers, merchants, and laborers who went to Ulan Had to be killed by Russian and Mongolian troops more than 17,000 people. The bones were piled up and the blood was red. The Chinese who took the route from Kyakhta around Uliastai to escape back to their country froze and starved to death in the snowy and icy weather, their corpses lying all over the field. Those who suffered hardships and escaped the net without dying were all haggard and pale when they arrived in Manchuria. As for the Chinese who failed to escape in the Dongyingzi area near Kulun, more than 3,700 people were massacred. Afterwards, the Chamber of Commerce was ordered to use large carts to carry the corpses and throw them into the nearby tile kilns. The Chinese merchants of the Sambeizi Banner were driven into wooden houses, and they were shot dead through the surrounding windows. Afterwards, the Chinese who had not died near the area were ordered to carry the corpses on their backs and discard them in the wilderness. The people who carried the corpses were also shot. Even more cruel, the clothes and quilts of the Chinese were stripped off, their intestines were gouged out and tied to trees, and then the people were dragged away. Their lives were cut short before their intestines were completely stretched out. Such various tortures are too numerous to mention. The number of properties and goods looted and confiscated in various places is already uncountable. In the tenth year of the Republic, the Soviet Red Army took advantage of the name of driving out Semenov to occupy Kulun. The various aggressions were even more poisonous than the White Russians. They advocated helping weak nations, feigning friendliness while secretly practicing communism. At that time, all Mongolian institutions hired Russians as advisors. All orders and commands were completely controlled by the advisors. The Mongolian officials were merely puppets of Soviet policy.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth year of the Republic, the Mongolian government was established and the capital was built in Kulun, renamed Ulaanbaatar. The Russians used Mongolian revolutionary youth who had been cultivated in Soviet Russia to vigorously spread propaganda, causing them to hate the Chinese and massacre tens of thousands of Chinese. If any Mongolian princes or lamas were suspected of being pro-Chinese, they would be arrested and imprisoned by political force from within and sentenced to death on false charges of internal rebellion or counter-revolution, such as Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Khutughtu Zayin Khutuktu, Khan Tseng Khutuktu, Tsereng Dorji Dantseng Sedda Danba Dorji, etc. The rest of the victims are still unknown.</p>
<p>The conscription system was implemented, and Russians were hired as directors and coaches. All military equipment, clothing, airplanes, automobiles, and other military supplies were purchased from Russia at exorbitant prices. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Bengbu All-Circles Representative Assembly</h3>

The meeting adjourned at 12 o'clock (May 10th).</p>
<h3>Anqing Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Ma Fuxiang has been in office for several days and has made some arrangements for politics. He has also been visiting various circles and attending banquets in various places for several days, which is quite busy. It was originally planned to go to Beijing on the 10th to attend the Mongolian-Tibetan conference held on the 12th, but due to the busy political affairs at the beginning of his term, he could not leave Anhui immediately. On the 8th, Liang Hejun, a political senior advisor to the Provincial Government, was sent to Beijing to contact all parties in Beijing.</p>
<p>Previously, due to the rice shortage in Anhui, the Provincial Government sent personnel together with the General Chamber of Commerce to take money to Shanghai to purchase sago to come to Anhui to provide relief to the people. It is now learned that the first batch of three thousand stones has been transported by the China Merchants Jianghua vessel and unloaded at the China Merchants stacking machine for rice merchants to pick up and sell.</p>
<p>The Civil Affairs Department yesterday appointed Si Suo as the Public Security Bureau Chief of Datong Town, Yu Fa as the Public Security Bureau Chief of Tunxi Town, Feng Jie as the Public Security Bureau Chief of Wuwei County, Bao Cijun, and Cheng Zhongxian as the Public Security Bureau Chief of Dingyuan Chihe Town.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau of the Provincial Capital previously formulated specific measures for three-family joint guarantees in order to prevent reaction and protect Anning, and submitted them to the Civil Affairs Department for approval and implementation. Recently, it was ordered to adjust, verify, and check the original guarantee certificates, affix the guarantor's seal, and carry the household registration books to check the new and old residents from door to door. Those without guarantee or certificates should fill them in as soon as possible, in order to be extra cautious.

<h3>Government Troops Defeat Bandits in Jin Suo Town</h3>
<p>The bandits set fire and swam away, 80 to 90 were killed, and more than 100 hostages were rescued.</p>
<p>The bandits in Jin Suo Town on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui were besieged by the Huang Regiment of the 133rd Brigade and the artillery platoon of the Jiangsu Security Team. The bandits initially resisted the government troops stubbornly. Seeing the fierce artillery fire of the government troops, the east, west, and south gates of Jin Suo Town were surrounded, and the police teams of Suqian and Siyang counties also rushed to help. Fearing that they would not be able to escape for long, they set fire to civilian houses, climbed over the walls, and swam to the northwest at 3 AM on the 9th of this month. They were shot dead by the government troops, killing 80 to 90, capturing more than 10 alive, and rescuing more than 100 kidnapped hostages, and more than 10 loads of grain. Zhang Pengzhu, the magistrate of Siyang County, entered the town to inspect and handle the aftermath, and separately recruited and distributed the grain and materials for the rescued refugees. The Huang Regiment of the 133rd Brigade and the artillery platoon of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Team continue to track down and pursue the bandits. However, Cui Yunshan, the magistrate of Suqian County, was criticized by the Jiangsu Provincial Government for being slow to send troops due to the long distance. He has now personally led the county's police team to assist the Huang Regiment in the pursuit.</p>
<h3>Shantou Chamber of Commerce Refuses to Resist Heavy Taxes</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Shantou's business has been declining for years, and heavy taxes and miscellaneous taxes have been increasing repeatedly. Xu Xiqing, the mayor of Shantou, recently collected additional electricity surcharges and wanted to borrow half a month's rent from the residents of the city. The citizens of Shantou felt unable to bear it and expressed dissatisfaction. A city-wide representative assembly was held on May 5, and Shi Ziqin and Ma Zonghan were elected as representatives to request Mayor Xu to be exempted, but to no avail. Another meeting was held on the morning of the 7th, and it was decided that the city would unanimously resist the heavy taxes. The telegram from the Shantou Chamber of Commerce to the Provincial Government is recorded below: "To Chen, Chairman of the Provincial Government in Guangzhou, and Xu, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, Fan, Director of the Department of Finance, and Deng, Director of the Department of Construction: The commercial circles of Shantou City have repeatedly requested to cancel the additional electricity surcharge and to collect half a month's rent from the Municipal Government, about 60,000 yuan, to continue the police training institute and purchase patrol boats and guns. After convening a temporary representative assembly to submit it for discussion, everyone felt that the electricity surcharge had been cancelled in the entire province, but Shantou City alone still existed. It is unfortunate that the business situation is getting worse and the burden is really unbearable. Moreover, the investigation of the city treasury's income has increased sharply in recent years, and there is more than enough to pay for various expenses. Therefore, the commercial circles have repeatedly requested cancellation and appealed endlessly, but not only have they not been approved, the Municipal Government has recently changed to collecting it themselves and promulgated many harsh regulations. No wonder the public is indignant. The training of the police and the purchase of patrol boats and firearms are all public security matters and should be paid by the city treasury. It is impossible to draw funds for one thing, and it is not necessary to submit it to the superiors for approval. How can the business people have the financial resources to frequently provide supplies? The Chamber of Commerce has previously requested the Municipal Government to approve the establishment of a financial management committee in accordance with the precedents of other counties and cities to publicly collect and spend money. We should send another telegram to urge the authorities to order the Municipal Government to establish the above two items as soon as possible. Whether the two items of donations should be collected must be reviewed and handled by the Financial Management Committee. The Committee may not arbitrarily collect money before it is established. We beg you to immediately approve the telegram to stop the implementation in order to convince the public and avoid disputes. And record the case and submit it to the Municipal Government for temporary postponement of the collection of half a month's rent and the additional electricity surcharge. A consensus was reached. It is appropriate to record the case and send a telegram to the Supreme Commander for inspection. Please immediately approve the telegram to stop the implementation and give a reply. I am extremely grateful. Shantou Chamber of Commerce Chairman Chen Shaowen, Standing Committee members Lin Yushu, Zhang Yuanzhang, Xu Wanru, Chen Zibin, and all members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees."

<p>The Beginning and End of the County Government Secretary's Investigation: Regarding the case of the former county government secretary, Xiao Shougang, being investigated for smoking opium, the Party and the government each held their own views. The county government issued an urgent announcement stating that the county magistrate had been seriously ill and had submitted a request to the provincial government for resignation, and before handing over his duties, he had requested sick leave to go to Shanghai for recuperation. All duties were performed by Secretary Xiao Shougang as an agent. It is now reported that at 1:00 PM on the 6th of this month, two members of the county party headquarters suddenly came to the government with name cards affixed with the seal of the headquarters, and used deceptive words to invite Secretary Xiao to the party headquarters, which immediately detained him. Not only was there no one in charge of all administrative matters in the government, but it was also during the serious defense period in May, and if there was a warning, what would be done? At the same time, the county party headquarters also issued a letter stating that County Government Secretary Xiao Shougang was suspected of smoking opium, and the 76th committee meeting of the headquarters resolved to transfer the matter to the Supervisory Committee to send personnel to the government to jointly conduct an investigation in accordance with the law, and a letter was sent to your government. Secretary Xiao then came to the meeting with staff member Li Du to conduct an investigation, and instructed staff member Li to return to the government and send personnel to the meeting to accompany the investigation. However, after staff member Li returned to the government, no personnel were sent. Now, a notice has been received stating that the headquarters detained him, which is not in accordance with the facts and must be corrected. It is now known that Secretary Xiao has been terminated yesterday (the 9th) after being investigated by the party headquarters, and the Supervisory Committee issued a certificate stating that he was not addicted to opium, and the Executive Committee issued separate letters for consultation.</p>

When Police Squad Leader Yang found out, he led the police to a small teahouse in the town the day before yesterday and captured them.

He has now confessed to the hearing officer and admitted to participating in the riot in the Zhuangxing burning and robbery case.</p>

<p>The Theft and Anhui Record: Wang, who is from the Eleventh Ward of Sanshan Bridge in Xinqiao Township, is a vegetarian and believes in Buddhism, so he is generally called Wang Chisu (Wang the Vegetarian). The night before, many bandits suddenly broke into the house, broke the door and entered, rushed into each bedroom, overturned boxes and cabinets, and searched arbitrarily. They also forced Wang Chisu to reveal the place where he hid the silver, but they did not succeed. Before leaving, the thief stabbed Wang's thigh. The night before, the Fei family of Mingxing Bridge in the city was also stolen. It is said that there were three boxes of fine fur clothing, worth a lot of money. The next day, the patrol officer of the Fourth Police Station went to investigate in order to track down the thieves.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Winding Up of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters: At the beginning of the establishment of the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters, it was stipulated that the bandits should be cleared within one and a half months. Now, the major bandit gangs in various places along the Taihu Lake in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have been dispersed, and the remaining fleeing bandits can be cleared by the land and water police in various places. Therefore, Hu Zuyu, the commander-in-chief of the bandit suppression, has reported separately to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the general headquarters to report the winding up. There are still 45 captured bandits, including Tian Kuaizi, whose cases have not been decided. Yesterday (the 12th) at noon, a platoon of soldiers was dispatched to escort them to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for detention and investigation. Hu Zuyu also hosted a banquet for all sectors of society at the Railway Hotel yesterday afternoon to report on the bandit suppression process and the ending, hoping that the people would cooperate with the military and police to eliminate the remaining bandits in order to eliminate hidden dangers. His troops will go to Jiangbei to suppress bandits within two or three days, and the matter will be the responsibility of Xiong (Shihui).</p>

<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>County Court Inspects Suicide Case: Wang Yuande, a shop assistant at Ge Yongyu's firecracker shop on Xinma Road outside the West Gate of Wuyi, suddenly hanged himself the day before yesterday. Zhang Rucheng, a prosecutor from the county court, led officials to inspect the scene on the morning of the 11th and confirmed that he had hanged himself. As for the reason for the suicide, according to Ge's mother, she had had a quarrel with a woman a few days ago, or she had committed suicide because of this. This case is quite bizarre. The inspection officer is investigating the case after returning to the court. Inspection of Rickshaws: The Wuyi Public Security and Construction Bureaus held an inspection of rickshaws in front of the Public Security Bureau on the 11th. Both bureaus sent personnel to serve on the spot. If any vehicles did not meet the regulations, they were ordered to correct them at any time.

<p>Prohibition of New Foreign Clothing: Recently, the call for promoting domestic goods has been very high, but without laws and regulations to punish it, it is difficult to achieve.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>The Takeover Issue of the Municipal Police Department: The preparatory period of the Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office has expired and it has been ordered to be abolished. The internal affairs of the office will be transferred to the relevant bureaus of the county government for takeover. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Sun followed the approval to transfer on the 15th. However, the citizens of the First District believe that this provincial order will fragment the entire municipal undertaking and may not achieve the effect of unified authority for autonomous undertakings. Therefore, the citizens of the entire district held a meeting to discuss the method and immediately elected representatives such as Hua Yishan, Yang Hanxi, and Cao Hengzhi to go to the province to petition, requesting that the various affairs of the Municipal Preparatory Office be transferred to the First District Public Office for takeover. Yesterday, more than ten people, including Hua Jun, took a car to Beijing at about 10:00 AM to meet with fellow villagers from Beijing, including Yu Zhonghuan, and went to Zhenjiang to petition Chairman Ye of the Provincial Government and the two directors of the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction.</p>
<p>Yan Donghang Crushed a Passenger to Death: The Xicheng route of the Yan Dong Automobile Company's steamship was fully loaded with passengers yesterday morning and departed from Cheng to Wuxi. When passing the Huangtiandang turn, there were several large coal boats moored on the river bank. The stern of the ship was blocking the center of the river and suddenly collided with the Wan Shun Company's ship towed by the steamship. Liu Rongzeng, the manager of the Changzhou Xietaiheng Coal Company, was standing on the left side of the ship. The hull vibrated and he lost his footing, fell down, and his body was embedded in the gap between the coal boat and the company's ship. His abdomen and back were crushed and he fainted on the spot. After his companions shouted for the ship to stop, Liu fell into the river and was rescued by people and taken to the Brothers Hospital for treatment, but he was too seriously injured and soon died. His companions telegraphed the deceased's family and reported to the county government for inspection. In the evening, the deceased's younger brother, Liu Rongfu, and his cousin, Liu Rongchun, came to Wuxi from Shenyang, rushed to the hospital to comfort the body and cried bitterly, intending to send the body to the Yan Dong Company. After being persuaded, the family of the deceased has filed a complaint with the county government against the company for disregarding human life and requesting legal action.</p>
<p>The Great Pessimism of the Silk Industry: Since the beginning of spring in Wuxi, there has been more rain and less sunshine, and the weather has been inconsistent. The spring silkworms have been greatly affected. Many of the early crops died during the first sleep, and most of the seeds sold by speculative seed fields were of poor quality, so the results were very bad. The weather was hot and sultry for the past two days, with yellow sand falling, and the past two days have been suddenly cold, with thunder rumbling. The impact on the silkworms has been even greater. The market price of mulberry leaves has plummeted to only 1.2 yuan per dan, and no one is asking about it. Seeing this situation, silk cocoon merchants have repeatedly suffered a tragic fall in the silk market, and the harvest in Zhejiang and Shaoxing is only 30 to 40%, and the reeling rate is as high as 700%. Fearing that they will repeat the mistakes of the Guihai year, most of them are at a loss. The cocoon firms that rented earlier have now retired their rents one after another, so there are frequent reports of negotiations. The Cocoon Industry Association has scheduled a meeting on the 18th to gather everyone to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Xi Zhaodi Committed Suicide by Drowning After Being Abused: Ni Rendi (20 years old), the child bride of Ni, the owner of the Yuanyou Rice Store in Xinsanliqiao, Beidang, worked in the second loom of the Yuankang Silk Factory in Huangbudun, and brought a female worker, Xi Zhaodi (15 years old, from Shasha), to hit the basin. A few days ago, Ni Rendi, because she thought that Xi Zhaodi's work was not good, poured boiling water into the basin without asking the reason, causing Zhaodi to be scalded all over and unable to move. After leaving work, Zhaodi, because she was angry, filled with resentment and wanted to end her life, so she went behind people's backs and threw herself into the river there and committed suicide. It was not until 4:00 PM yesterday that Zhaodi's body was found in Shuangheshangbang nearby. Now, Zhaodi's father, Xi Awu, immediately went to identify the body after hearing the news and confirmed that it was his daughter's body. The situation was very tragic, and it was also learned that the reason for his daughter's suicide was great anger, so he twisted Ni Rendi into the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau to await verification, and reported to the county government requesting mutual inspection as evidence for legal action.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Beating Up the Survey Team: A survey team of the Huaihe River Commission of more than ten people came to Yangzhou to survey the river course along the Huaihe River to prepare for the start of dredging. Yesterday (the 10th), they surveyed through Huojiaqiao and set stakes. The villagers in the area suspected that they were here to force them to work and give way again, so they immediately beat gongs and gathered the people at Xinmatou to tie up engineer Ding and seven workers with ropes. Only engineer Ma Dengyun escaped. After Ma escaped, he rushed to the city to report to the county government. The county government telegraphed the Public Security Bureau to send a team to rescue them. The Public Security Bureau Director assigned Huang Yunshan, a patrol officer from the First Branch, to lead many armed police officers to the area to rescue them. At that time, the villagers understood that the measurement was not to force them to work, nor could it encroach on the people's land, and released the members one after another. It is said that most of the members were injured, and a certain secretary was seriously injured due to too much vomiting. They are now being treated separately. As for the ship that the members were on, it was sunk by Zhang Min in the area, and all the surveying equipment and luggage in the ship were lost except for half of it. I don't know how the official authorities will deal with this dispute.</p>
<p>Properly Handle the Survey of the Lower Reaches of Various Dams: The Canal Engineering Office of Jiangbei previously intended to prepare a method for preventing floods due to the rise of the Taofan water and telegraphed the Construction Department. The Jiangdu Chamber of Commerce also telegraphed the Construction Department for fear of the water situation, requesting that the Engineering Office quickly open the various dams returning to the river. Now, Wu Tongju, the director of the Engineering Office, has sent a special member to inspect the water situation of the various dams in order to start spring repairs and whether to open them in advance.</p>
<p>Eighth and Ninth District Dispute at Lujiazui: The county government instructed Wang Zhu, from the First District Public Office, to jointly survey with the heads of the Eighth and Ninth Districts, draw maps and separately report to the county government for verification and decision due to the dispute over the jurisdiction of Lujiazui between the Eighth District Public Office and the Ninth District Public Office.</p>

He was then sent to the county government for legal action.</p>
<h3>Funing</h3>
<p>Schedule to Relieve Disaster Victims: The Funing area has been barren for years, and rice and firewood are expensive. Disaster victims in the four townships are crying for food. Previously, Director Hao of the China Foreign Relief Society brought relief money to Funing for distribution. Zhao Tianhe, a standing committee member of the county party headquarters, went to Shanghai to convene fellow villagers from the Huai area to organize a relief society in Shanghai to promote the disaster in Funing and raise more than 10,000 yuan in relief money. The money has been sent to Funing by letter and a representative, Jin Chunlin, has been sent to Funing to supervise the distribution. After arriving in Funing, Jin Jun invited the heads of the Relief Branch and the various districts to complete the procedures for investigating the disaster-stricken households and distributing tickets in the four townships. It is heard that the disaster tickets are divided into four types: "All under Heaven is Public." The "Heaven" character is 2 yuan, the "Below" character is 3 yuan, the "Is" character is 4 yuan, and the "Public" character is 5 yuan. The severity of the disaster-stricken households is weighed and distributed accordingly. Now, on the morning of May 10, the distribution will be held at the Liu Mengjiang General Temple in the east of the city. The Relief Branch has sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau requesting the temporary dispatch of police to maintain order.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Bandits Robbed and Shot a Farmer: There are more than 40 households in Shen Village, Guoxiyuan, in the west of this city, but the Zhou family is the most numerous, all of whom are wealthy. Zhou Caifu's father died when he was young, and his mother, Shen, worked hard to raise him. Fortunately, Caifu grew up to be 28 years old this year and can also be diligent and frugal in inheriting the family business. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 PM on the 8th, a dozen bandits suddenly came, each holding guns and breaking through the back door. At that time, Caifu was feeding silkworms with mulberry leaves in the hall. His wife told him to avoid them quickly, but Caifu did not know that the bandits had arrived, so he shouted loudly to his wife to leave. The bandits mistakenly thought that he was using a wooden gun to attack them, so they opened fire on him. The bullet entered from the left armpit and exited from the right side, and he died immediately. The bandits knew that the god of wealth was dead, so they robbed a silk quilt from the inner room and left, leaving behind a letter demanding 2,000 yuan. At the same time, Zhou Shunfu, Zhou Housheng, Zhou Asan, and other three families in the village also received this bandit letter, the language was roughly the same, but the numbers were different.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Cocoon Industry Conference Opens the Date of Weighing: The Jiaxing Cocoon Industry Association used the silkworm to go up to the cluster cocoon market in the four townships is about to propose a motion. Therefore, yesterday, a joint meeting of cocoon merchants and factory owners was convened in the association. It was decided that: (1) The date of opening the weighing: Jianan is set for the 15th and 16th, Jiabei is set for the 16th and 17th. (2) The highest price of fresh cocoons is 55 yuan per dan. (3) Various donation cases: A. The house donation is based on the Fen case. Cocoon stoves with more than ten times are taxed 15 yuan, and cocoon stoves with less than ten times are halved. B. Stamp tax will be determined after consultation on the number of recognitions. C. The cost of the relief hospital is 50 yuan for the old factory and 30 yuan for the new factory. D. The education donation is still paid according to the previous year's case. E. The cost of the county chamber of commerce is 10 yuan per factory. The Provincial Government has also resolved to record an additional donation of 10% on the cocoon donation to be used as security expenses. The Jiaxing Cocoon Industry Association has jointly requested the Jiangzhewan Silk Cocoon General Association to telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government requesting a postponement of the increase in order to sympathize with the farmers' difficulties.</p>
<p>Urging the Payment of the Concealed School Land Incentive Money: The Jiaxing Education Fund Association previously resolved to estimate the value of the land and give a 15% bonus if someone could find out the concealed or encroached school land that had been found to be true after being reported in order to sort out the school land. After renting, a bonus of 15% will be awarded. The resolution was announced to the public and submitted to the authorities for record. Subsequently, Xu Gengmin, the former contractor of the school land rent, successively found out that dozens of acres of encroached and concealed land had been reported to the association for verification, but the incentive money had not been received. Xu repeatedly sent letters requesting payment, but there was no solution. Now, Xu's contracting period has long expired, and last year's rent was affected by the poor harvest and the arrears of the subcontractors, as well as the various expenses such as investigating concealed and encroached school land. Therefore, he still owes 600 yuan in rent, which is negligible if the incentive money is allocated to offset it. Currently, Xu's arrears have been ordered by the Education Fund Association to be chased and paid by the police, but the incentive money is not mentioned. Therefore, Xu yesterday sent a letter urging the Education Fund Association to allocate the incentive money to offset the payment in order to emphasize the resolution and clear the procedures.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Security Team Came to Xiaoshan to Station: Recently, the price of rice in Xiaoshan has been rising, and the livelihood of the common people is difficult to maintain.

The Provincial Government has transferred the soldiers of the Tenth Company of the Second Battalion of the Third Regiment of the Security Team to Xiaoshan, led by Lieutenant Platoon Leader Xu Fugan, to station at Zhiyuan Temple.</p>
<p>The Xiaoshan-Jiang Section of the Railway Was Postponed: The Xiaoshan-Jian Section of the Xiaochang Light Railway had already started construction, and the Xiaoshan-Jiang Section was about to start construction. However, the spring flowers had ripened on the fields along the road. Once construction started, it would inevitably cause a lot of damage. The farmers of the two villages of Huawen and Fengtai in the area requested the village committees to forward the request to the county government and consult the Hangzhou-Jiang Railway Engineering Office to postpone the construction for one month so that they could harvest the spring flowers. After receiving the report, the county government forwarded it to the engineering office for investigation.</p>
<p>The People's Food Committee Was Established: The Xiaoshan County Government organized a People's Food Committee because the price of rice has been soaring recently and the future of people's food is worrying. The inaugural meeting was held on the 8th, and Du Shihua was elected as a standing committee member, and orders were issued to Yiqiao, Kanshan, Shanxi, Changhe, Wenyan, Linpu, and Heshangdian to speed up the preparation of branch offices and establish them within a set time.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing</h3>
<p>Police Arrested Gamblers and Gunshot Wound Case: The police of the Sunduan Public Security Branch in Shaoxing went to arrest gamblers near Sidong at night on the 9th. It happened that there were gambling sounds inside the Dahongqing Opera Troupe ship. The police went to the ship to arrest them because they were in plain clothes. The actors suspected that they were thugs and fought each other. Hua Patrol Captain took out his gun to show his power, but it was also taken away and tied up. The actors came to the city overnight and sent them to the court for investigation the next morning. Because it was a misunderstanding, they ordered both parties to go to the bureau to solve the problem. After the City Public Security Bureau received the report from the Sunduan Branch, they sent police to the Xiangqiao where the opera ship was parked on the morning of the 10th to arrest the people who beat the police. In the process of catching them, a wooden gun of Wei Police Zhang Xiquan went off, injuring two passers-by, Wang Xianchen, and others. They were sent to the hospital by the Li Detective Team Leader.</p>

<p>Today, the Men's Team Will Compete Again with a Mixed Team for Full Practice Before Going to Japan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese men's and women's volleyball teams competed with Fudan and Minli schools. The location was originally scheduled for the track and field arena, but due to rain and wet ground, it was temporarily changed to the Chinese Basketball Hall. The audience was quite enthusiastic. The game started at 3 o'clock. As a result, the men's team players won against Fudan with a score of 21-2 and 21-11. The women's team players won against Minli Girls' High School with a score of 21-2 and 21-9.</p>
<p>Men's Team Wins Against Fudan</p>
<p>After the bell rang three times, the men's game began. The players' team gathered the essence of various places, and its strength was undoubtedly strong. Although Fudan is a powerful force in the school, it is not an opponent of the players' team. Moreover, Cao Tingzan, the center of the team, also serves on the Chinese team. Therefore, in the first game, Fudan was under pressure everywhere and it was difficult to fight back, let alone attack. The first half was 11-2. In the second half, the players' team became more sharp. Fudan was at a loss. As a result, the players' team won with a score of 21-2. In the second game, Cao Tingzan and Qiu Guangbian, the mainstays of the players' team, were transferred to the Fudan team, and the situation became more balanced. However, due to the lack of connection and the ability to save the ball, Fudan lost again with a score of 11-21. The lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Players' Team (First Row): Zhu Zusheng, Li Lianju, Xin Guirong (Second Row): Chen Xibing, Cao Tingzan, Qiu Guangbian (Third Row): Li Fujia, Ceng Jicun, Chen Congchao</p>
<p>Fudan Team (First Row): Mai Wentang, Cheng Mingjue, Chen Zijing (Second Row): Xie Baochang, Chen Fuyu, Wu Changfa (Third Row): Li Fujun, Zhao Binglin, Wen Tianpeng</p>
<p>Women's Team Wins Against Minli</p>
<p>After the men's game was over, the women's group started the game. Su Shilian of the Minli team scored two points first, opening the record, but after that, she fell sharply. The players made great efforts to attack and made great achievements. The score rose sharply and they scored 21 points in a row, winning the first game with a score of 21-2. In the second game, the battle was even more intense. The front and middle rows of the players' team were able to jump up and spike the ball, which was quite skillful, and Minli was able to save dangerous balls, which was greatly praised by the audience. Miss Yin Linzheng's serve in the back row was extremely powerful. Minli finally found it difficult to win due to her isolated position and weak strength. As a result, the players' team won the second game with a score of 21. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Players' Team (First Row): Chen Peiyue, Lu Huiqin, Wang Chunruo, Liao Siyi (Second Row): Chen Peiyue, Lu Huiqin, Wang Chunruo, Xian (Third Row): Xu Guixin, Lu Tuo Naiying, Li Zhimei, Deng Zhihao</p>
<p>Minli Team (First Row): Dai Zuling, Zhu Yaoying, Yong Lijun, Peng Shufang (Second Row): Guo Wanru, Li Jinkuan, Huang Jifen, Dai Zhengrui (Third Row): Cheng Hongsheng, Su Zushi, Yin Linzheng, Huang Ping</p>

<h3>Memorial Days in America in May by Yan Ye</h3>
<p>In our country, May is considered a poisonous month, as the anniversaries of May Third, May Ninth, and May Thirtieth are all days of national humiliation. On the east coast of the Pacific, in America, there are also many memorial days in May, but they are mostly joyful and celebratory festivals. Therefore, America is known as "Five Beauties" in May. How different are the experiences of people on the west coast of the Pacific! The American memorials are described as follows: May 1st, International Labor Day, is known to all. Although this festival is universally recognized, it was created by the American workers who bled in Chicago forty years ago. On this day, in America, it is also called May Day, or "May Beauty" Festival. Therefore, American girls like to use the words "May Beauty" as names. Girls' schools and primary schools in various places hold dances, games, and various grand gatherings on May Day. People from all walks of life also come and go in droves to enjoy the whole day. This year, the American president has ordered this day to be Children's Day. The White House is open, and children are allowed to visit the palace and play various games. The president and his wife even personally come out to receive them as honored guests. Before the European War, the United States also opened the White House every year on Easter for children to enter and play games such as egg-rolling. This practice stopped when the European War started, but now it is available again, which is truly the happiness of American children. May 12th is American Mother's Day. The "compassion" refers to the compassion of mothers. On this day, American women must give gifts to their mothers, and the gifts must be things that their mothers usually like - clothes, food, utensils, etc., depending on what their mothers like. This is because the growth, upbringing, and hard work of children are all done by the hands of mothers. Therefore, fathers do not feel offended when their daughters give gifts to their mothers but not to themselves.</p>
<p>May 30th is American Memorial Day. Since the beginning of the four-year civil war in America in 1861, a memorial tower has been specially built in New York for the soldiers and sailors who died for their country to honor their merits. A national cemetery was also built not far from the capital, with the tomb of General Grant, who performed extraordinary feats in the war, being the most magnificent. Every year on May 30th, people from all over the country come here to pay their respects and condolences. Sometimes the president even comes to give a speech, and the scene is very grand.</p>
<h3>Musk: Clear and Elegant by Qing Qu</h3>
<p>Musk is an important and precious commodity in our country's medicine. However, musk is produced in the snowy mountains of the Himalayas and the Altai Mountains, and is also found in Tibet and Sichuan.</p>
<p>Two Strange Diseases Recorded by Bo Ming</p>
<p>The Bo Xi Hospital is the leading Western-style hospital in Suzhou. Patients from neighboring counties come to seek treatment. Here are two cases to inform readers:</p>
<p>(1) A 64.5-pound Giant Tumor: A young woman from Baoying had a large tumor in her abdomen, looking like a pregnant woman. After arriving at the hospital, surgery was performed, and a large basin of tumorous flesh was removed, weighing 64.5 pounds. This can be said to be an unprecedentedly large tumor. (2) A Child with Facial Features Growing Below the Abdomen: The son of a certain person in this city, two years old this year, has eyes, ears, nose, and mouth growing below his abdomen, covered with a thin, transparent skin. They specially sought treatment at the hospital for its removal. This child having double facial features is also rare. Physiology researchers should know about it.</p>
<p>Musk is also one of the medicinal materials used for childbirth and is quite profitable. The "Musk" explanation in the "Shuowen Jiezi" states, "Like a small deer, the navel has a fragrance, also named Shefu." The "Erya Shi Beast" says, "Shefu...foot." The "Zilin" says, "A small deer with fragrance, its foot resembles..., hence called...foot." The "Zihui Note" says, "The beast is like a small deer with tiger and leopard patterns on its body. The navel has a fragrance. When forced by people, it throws itself from high cliffs, raises its claws, and extracts the fragrance, then binds itself and dies, still providing its four feet to protect its navel. Therefore, it is like elephants retreating their teeth, rhinos retreating their horns, and musk deer retreating their fragrance, all covering it up, knowing its preciousness." Now, I heard from someone from Yunnan that the musk deer resembles a deer, but is small in stature, with ash-brown fur on its ears, a long neck, a small head, a bluish-white abdomen and feet, an extremely short tail, and sharp hooves, which is no different from what is written in the books. It is a pity that the predecessors did not mention its origin.</p>
<p>It is said that only the male musk deer has fragrance. Below the navel of the male musk deer grows a gland sac that secretes all the time, and its fragrance can be smelled throughout the fields. Therefore, hunters often follow its tracks by smell. However, musk deer always live in dense forests and jungles, living in caves and holes, and are only active at night, so it is not easy to obtain them. In recent years, more and more people are capturing them, and they are becoming increasingly rare. The high price is due to the small output, and one of the reasons is that they are exported to foreigners. Every year, those transported to Guangdong and Shanghai are stored in wooden boxes, and some counterfeit products are mixed in. Without the ability to distinguish, one will inevitably fall into its trap without knowing it. Each box contains about ten or up to twenty musk deer. If they are not counterfeit, then those produced in Yunnan are the best, which are not as good as those from Tokyo, Japan.</p>
<p>The musk is round in shape and like a sac, weighing about thirty tiles. The outside has fine, slightly black and short hairs with a slightly white surround. The middle contains musk, which is like particles and has an extremely fragrant and strong nature, stimulating the nose. However, when smelled suddenly, it seems to have a strange smell like ammonia. This is why it is different. Its particles are said to be "dang men zi." Those that are dry and in the form of lumps can be ground into powder, releasing a special fragrance. However, it is taboo to dryness or contact with camphor and sulfur, which will lose its inherent nature. If it encounters humid air, it will return to its original state. Therefore, those who are good at preserving it can keep its fragrance from dissipating even after decades, and it will become more concentrated.</p>
<h3>A Wedding of a Movie Star</h3>
<p>By Chen Yuanliang</p>
<p>Those who pay attention to domestic films in our country mostly know Xu Weihan. Mr. Xu is romantic, refined, and artistically superb. He became famous for co-starring with Yin Mingzhu in "Returning to the Hometown." The film "The Dangerous Marriage" directed by him and Xiao Lingbo in Tianjin was also screened in Shanghai. Later, in films such as Youlian Company's "The Heroic Sons and Daughters" and Shenzhou Company's "A Pitiful Heart of Parents," he played important roles. His screen work always leaves a deep impression. He is currently translating English descriptions and subtitles for various companies, and his writing is concise and readable. However, although Mr. Xu is nearing the age of thirty, his marriage has not been settled. Some speculate that he once had a soulmate in the vast sea. A month ago, news came that he was engaged to Ms. Lian Shanshan, a fellow villager. It is said that the steps were completely taken in the eighteenth-century style, which is truly unexpected for the general public. The wedding ceremony was held on the 3rd of this month at the Fuxing Garden. On that day, there were many congratulatory guests. In addition to the movie stars, there were Zhang Qiuchong, Xu Bibo, Zhang Biwu, and others from the literary and art circles. When the bell rang four times, the congratulatory guests were eagerly waiting for the arrival of the newlyweds. Suddenly, the sound of music was heard, and Mr. Wei Hui, the groom's brother, led the way, continuously chanting hymns. Only after getting out of the car did we realize it was another bride. According to...</p>
<h3>Three Days in Yizheng (4) - Notes from Xie, Leader of the National Walking Group</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 18th, everyone got up at 7:00 AM, washed up, and went to the county party headquarters. County Magistrate Tian arrived soon after. The meeting began with a report from the chairman, followed by a short speech from me. However, being unfamiliar with the local dialect, I could not fully express myself. Then, armed comrades and County Magistrate Tian gave passionate speeches, all based on academic theories. After the meeting, we marched. I and Director Li of the Education Bureau visited the county's experimental primary school, where Principal Wang Xinmu warmly received us and led us on a tour. Inside the school, we met Xiong Bijiun, a farmer investigator from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture and Mines. Mr. Xiong was a young, experienced, and insightful man who understood the hardships of the people. Talking with him and receiving his guidance was very rewarding. We then went to the Anji Class, a branch of the school, where we attended a music class. Teacher Zhao was able to understand the children and was very patient and persuasive. (It is said that Teacher Zhao's nickname is "Great Monkey King.") After saying goodbye, we visited the county prison, where Warden Zhang Xiaoyu led us inside. The newly built prison consisted of eight rooms with a capacity of 140 prisoners, mostly for theft. The lighting in the rooms was good, but the air was insufficient and smelled unpleasant. After a brief inspection, we left. It was already past noon. We bid farewell and had lunch at Juxing Garden. After eating, we returned to the residence to rest. Xiong Bijun came to visit, and we went to the Farmers' Education Center in Xupu Bridge with Director Li and Captain Wei. The site of the center used to be the Chuantian Nunnery. The internal facilities were complete, but it was still in the preparatory stage and had not yet officially opened. Later, Dean Sun Shaowen called the farmers to sing farmers' songs. The lyrics were both emotional and literate, and the pronunciation was clear and crisp. These were the so-called Xupu farmers' songs of the county. As dusk approached, we returned. I first passed by a certain place and saw a stone tablet personally inscribed by Zhao Mengfu, more than sixteen feet high, with elegant and unrestrained calligraphy. It was extremely valuable. Entering the city, we went to the relief center again to attend a welcome meeting for people from all walks of life. After drinking several rounds, at the suggestion of a certain gentleman, Dean Sun sang farmers' songs, and I sang Cantonese songs. Dean Sun's farmers' songs were as clear and crisp as those of a good singer, but the gentlemen present listened to my Cantonese songs and thought they sounded like killing chickens and ducks, eliciting laughter. Then, Gong sang a Kunqu opera excerpt. In the evening, the impressions were still in my mind. It was already 10:20 PM. We said goodbye and went to work, and only then did we go to bed and fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 19th, I got up at 6:00 AM. It rained heavily that morning, and it stopped at 8:00 AM. It happened to be the day of the sports meeting at the experimental primary school. Zhuang Xueben, Xu Yintang, and Liang Daxin went to the meeting to observe. I and Xiong Bijun visited Mr. Yi Shaozong, a famous elder in the county. We met him halfway and went to his residence. The study was elegant, and the flower garden was beautiful, worthy of being a scholar's residence. He showed us Han jade (Mr. Liu likes Han jade) and taught us how to distinguish between genuine and fake and the age of the jade, explaining everything in detail. I was especially grateful. It was already noon, and we said goodbye. He also gave me six copies of his own book, "Mao Shi Yi Xu," and invited me to chat in the park after lunch. I and Mr. Xiong went our separate ways and then invited comrades to have lunch in the park. After enjoying the delicious food of Zhenzhou, we waited for Mr. Liu to arrive and engaged in conversation. As dusk approached, we said goodbye and returned to the residence to organize our work and prepare to advance to Yangzhou tomorrow. During this trip to more than ten counties, I made a simple comparison. I recommend Jiading for education promotion, the public library, and Taicang, Suzhou, and Wuxi for ordinary cities, which should be discussed separately. For the number of newspapers, I recommend Changshu. For relief agencies, I recommend Yizheng. For young and erudite county magistrates, I recommend Mr. Tian.</p>
<p>It is said that Shanghai dialect calls it a good day for marriage. There were as many as three weddings held at the Fuxing Garden. When the newlyweds arrived, everyone wanted to be the first to see them. The groom wore a black dress suit, held a black velvet top hat in his hand, and held the bride's arm, supporting her hand. His attitude was very natural. He was used to playing on the screen, so he was very skilled in this ceremony and had no hint of reluctance. The bride wore a scarlet embroidered cheongsam, light gauze, and high-heeled shoes, looking extremely beautiful and radiant. No wonder the groom often gazed at her when the old pastor Yu Zongzhou was praying. When entering the banquet, we suddenly saw Zhou Wenzhu and Wenli accompanying Wang Cilong, and the atmosphere suddenly became tense. The eyes of the congratulatory guests all focused on them. Ms. Wenzhu wore a black shirt edged with ginger-yellow, and her movements were graceful, implying a light in elegance. In the middle of the wine, colleagues wanted to tease the newlyweds and asked Mr. Xu to offer wine and dishes to Ms. Lian. Mr. Xu asked in a low voice every time, requesting gently before doing so. Their intimate situation was truly enviable. Later, Mr. Ge Chen, the younger brother of Dr. Wang Chonghui, initiated a kissing ceremony for the newlyweds. Although the groom looked embarrassed, he could not refuse the great enthusiasm, so he kissed her once, and the bride could not help but blush.</p>
<p>Brief News: Yu Shengming, also known as Mianqin Guanzhu, is skilled in epigraphy and painting, especially calligraphy. He is a member of the Guanhai Tanyi Society in Shanghai (Note: This society is organized by famous calligraphers and painters in Shanghai). He is also friends with Cao Jingtao, Kuang Youhan, Kuang Xiaosong, Zhao Du, and Yong. This time, Mr. Yu came from Shanghai to Pingyao to visit friends. He originally planned to stay for a short time and then return to Shanghai. However, people in the town asked him for calligraphy, painting, and seal carving, so much so that he could not handle it all at once, so he could not return immediately. It is said that Mr. Yu's art is all superb, and his stone drum script is simple and ancient, which is especially praised by contemporary connoisseurs. (Chang)</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (1) (9) (1) by Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 11: Emerald Nets and Pearl Hairpins, a Beautiful Woman Returns; a Fine Scholar's Green Chamber and Red Tent, a Famous Courtesan Marries into a Famous Family</p>
<p>Let me now say that the people at Zuo Shichen's table were all acquaintances: Shi Guanting, Han Jingqi, Long Ziyun, Lin Fanzi, Yi Yunshang, Ling Zhixiang, and also Liu Yinbo's brother, Liu Xingshu. Although he was very busy today, running around and not staying for a moment, he often sat at this table. Among all the people at the table, except for Han Jingqi, who was not from the circle, everyone else was. Han Jingqi was an editor at the Ping Bao newspaper. He always wore a Western suit, but he said that today he was here to attend a wedding, so according to the rules, he should wear a dress suit, but he did not have a Western dress suit, so he wore Chinese clothes. People persuaded him to also call for a song, but he said, "What's the point? You call, and I'll watch. Isn't it the same?" Long Ziyun was very happy to call for songs, but he did not advocate promiscuity and did not want to be a garbage truck. There was a slogan in the Qunyuan, which was that people who called for too many songs were called garbage trucks, meaning that they did not discriminate between good and bad. Long Ziyun said that calling for a song was like reading a book, and you should choose what you like to read. He did not like doing the work of a sea otter sacrificing to the sea. Therefore, he only called for a few brothels from the Bao family in Puqingli. Yi Yunshang was even more strict than Long Ziyun. They gave him a nickname called "From Beginning to End." He only called for Zhu Feng from Qinghefang and never called for a second person. Some people said that it was not that he did not think of a second person, but that he was probably strictly controlled by Zhu Feng and was not allowed to have any non-essential demands. In fact, this sentence "From Beginning to End" was very effective. Yi Yunshang got married not long after, and Zhu Feng, whom he had been pursuing, also got married. From then on, he no longer frequented the pleasure quarters. He said that he had returned from studying in the United States and had to try what he had not tried. Now that he had tried it, the taste was nothing more than that, and there was no need to indulge in it anymore. Lin Fanzi took a promiscuous approach to calling for songs at that time. He was willing to call for anyone who was good to see. He said that calling for a song was like looking at famous paintings. For example, there were several famous paintings here, unless they were the secret treasures of someone's family and they were unwilling to take them out for others to see. That was just like a beauty being hidden in a golden house. If there was an opportunity to display famous paintings, who wouldn't want to see them? He enjoyed the pleasure of feasting his eyes in the presence of antique devils. Therefore, Lin Fanzi's account for calling songs was quite large. However, it was not as large as Ling Zhixiang's. Ling Zhixiang told Lin Fanzi that you take the promiscuous approach, and I take the philanthropic approach. There was also a reason for this, because Ling Zhixiang was a giant in the business world. In the business world, he had to socialize. His deals were big, and he often discussed business matters in that kind of social interaction, which he found to be smoother. Shanghai was a commercial port, and middlemen relied on that for their political power.</p>

<h3>Financial Interbank Lending Steadily Rising</h3>
<p>Market Overview: In Shanghai, in recent days, the import business has been thriving after the Spring Racing Season, and domestic goods have also gradually entered the market and developed. Therefore, the current smooth flow of goods is vastly different from the past, and the adjustment and demand in finance are of course self-evident.

<h3>Silver Dollar Uses: Random Notes</h3>
<p>The enthusiasm of Chinese and foreign businesses for purchasing and shipping goods has long been known to the business community. The details of the remittance of the price and the transportation situation, however, are still unclear. Here are a few important points: (1) Foreign Merchants: (A) Imported Piece Goods: Now, various summer orders are being shipped to Shanghai one after another, and the demand for funds from general ordering firms is extremely urgent. It is estimated that the silver amount of the price is no less than 5-6 million. (B) Large and Small Metals: Because there are many new houses being built this year in the construction industry, steel and other raw materials for building houses are usually supplied by foreign shipments. Therefore, the silver amount of this item, according to the investigation during the past week, is no less than 5 million. (C) Japanese goods are flooding the market, and sales are also gradually expanding. According to estimates from Japanese banks, the silver amount of the price is estimated to be more than 10 million. (2) Chinese Merchants: (A) Silk Cocoon Use of Foreign Funds: This year, the danger of robbery along the way has caused a decrease compared to last year, but there are still people shipping. In the past two weeks, the total amount of foreign exchange (notes and cash combined) was more than 5 million yuan. (B) Upper Yangtze Gang's Need for Miscellaneous Grains and Wheat: Since the past half month, sales have reached more than 3 million yuan, and there are still continuous allocations. (C) The purchase and preparation of rice by the Grain Association requires no less than 3-4 million yuan.</p>
<h3>The Gold Market in a Furious Storm</h3>
<p>In the morning, the price fluctuated wildly near the 20 tael mark, with swings as large as 3 taels. It was confusing and unclear, and the supply exceeded demand. Later, the price hovered slightly above 6 taels.</p>
<p>Yesterday, new records appeared with sudden highs and lows in rapid succession in the price of gold. The situation was unpredictable, with sudden increases and decreases. The underlying trend had discrepancies of several taels. Some dealers felt uneasy. Foreign exchange rates seemed tight, whether officially or unofficially, and banks were selling gold. Inside the market, supply exceeded demand, with companies like Zhifeng Yong, Hengxing, Yu Da, and others selling aggressively, while Da Decheng, Shunli, Yuancheng Yong, and others were buying. In the morning, the market opened higher because the London silver bar report from the day before yesterday (Sunday) showed a reduction. However, selling pressure was strong, leading to a fluctuation of two taels. Later, due to buying enthusiasm, the price briefly jumped to 519 taels. However, because the Guangdong firms and others persistently wanted to sell, it was difficult for the price to hold, and it suddenly dropped sharply by 3 taels, breaking below 516 taels. Around noon, the price recovered slightly by a tael or so. Then, the selling pressure eased. Afterwards, various firms sought to supply, but the quantity was not large, and the market was not as volatile as in the morning, with only a fluctuation of one tael or so. Eventually, it reached a little over 516 taels.</p>
<p>After opening higher, the price suddenly fell again. The day before yesterday (Sunday), London silver bars dropped another 1/16, and the price of silver fell by 3/8. The June gold price was 517 taels and 4 mace, an increase of 1 tael and 2 mace. The gross spread fluctuated wildly, reaching 18 taels and a half at one point, but Hengxing, Zhifeng Yong, and others were inclined to sell, so it fell by 2 taels. Foreign exchange rates were flat. August English gold was quoted at 10 pence 7, and June English gold was quoted at 10 pence 6.25. Near-term Japanese gold settled at 1 tael 8 fen 5 to 25.

As for the gold price, it was a little over 16 taels.</p>

In addition, June English gold could be transacted with an input/output of 10 pence 6.25. The gold price suddenly jumped up by 3 taels, with the momentum of a leap of a thousand feet. Around 10:30, it reached 19 taels and 1 mace. In an instant, Hengxing and speculators sold a considerable amount, causing the market to fall into a state of fatigue, dropping by more than 1-3 taels. Until 11:30, it fell to 15 taels 5-6 mace. Then, someone raised the price by more than 1 tael, and the market closed at 17 taels.</p>
<p>The afternoon market turned flat, and the closing price was only 1 mace better. The afternoon market opened at 17 taels 1 mace. Then, it fell from 17 taels 2 mace to 16 taels 2 mace. As there seemed to be more sellers and the bank bought near-term English gold at 10 pence 5.625, and Zhifeng Yong bought, the price rose by 1 tael. At 3 o'clock, it was 17 taels 3 mace. Afterwards, the selling pressure did not abate, and the exchange rate seemed weak. Near-term English gold could be settled at 10 pence 5.625, and Japanese gold was purchased at 1 tael 8 fen 375, causing the gold price to reverse slightly, losing over 1 tael. Around 4 o'clock, it was 15 taels 7-8 mace. When the market closed at 4:30, it was 16 taels 3 mace, only 1 mace higher than the previous Saturday.</p>

<h3>Yarn, Cotton, and Silk Markets Remain Calm</h3>
<p>The yarn market is stable, with a slightly firmer trend. This is because buyers are holding on tightly, so the market momentum in recent months has been stable and the rising trend is gradual. In reality, the overall situation is softening, and both imported cotton yarn and American cotton are weak, so the yarn market still has no major changes. The current demand for yarn is also not long-lasting, as the period is in the off-season. However, the market can still hold steady in the current month due to short covering.</p>
<p>Near-term futures yarn are slightly firmer. The sentiment in the market was good before the public auction. Retail investors bought to cover positions, and near-term contracts rose slightly by 1 mace. Far-term contracts remained flat due to a lack of business. The atmosphere in the afternoon market loosened. Trading in the current month was still active, and No. 66 yarn rose slightly due to some short covering, up another 1 mace. Far-term contracts were up 1 mace, and the overall situation remained calm. The total transaction volume for the day was 7,500 bales. The closing prices from the public auction are recorded below:</p>
<p>Public Auction Closing Prices, Change, Open Interest, Month</p>
<p>153.3 ... 219,500</p>
<p>May 152.9 Up 2 355,009 September 154.1 Up 2 11,750</p>
<p>June 152.8 13,155 October 54.7 25,200</p>

<h3>No Major Fluctuations in the Cotton Market</h3>
<p>American cotton prices saw mixed ups and downs. Market sentiment in this city was flat, and the situation was mediocre. The Shanghai firms had good intentions and were quite active, selling when prices rose and buying when they fell, so the situation was stable with no major ups and downs. There were more buyers of near-term contracts, and the market trended firm. One manufacturer predicted a price of 33 taels and 5 mace for October new cotton, so there was selling whenever prices rose.</p>
<p>Futures cotton covered shorts and rebounded slightly. The opening price for the Shanghai market was flat. Retail investors covered shorts, and the market was slightly firmer. Middle-term contracts were up 5 points. The market tightened in the afternoon due to rising gold prices, and the market sentiment became even stronger. All months were up 5 points to 1 mace and 5 points. The total transaction volume for the day was 17,000 dan. The closing prices for the Shanghai market are recorded below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Market Closing Prices, Change, Open Interest</p>

<p>May 35.15 Up 1 584,700 August 35.45 105,490</p>
<p>June 35.30 157,470 September 34.55 102,040</p>
<p>The spot cotton market turned quiet again. All factories had no appetite, and transactions were lacking.</p>
<p>Sources: Tong cotton 350 bales, Yao cotton 250 bales.</p>
<p>Sales Records:</p>
<p>Shaanxi cotton 35.35, fellow merchants bought 100 pieces for warehouse delivery.</p>
<p>Also 35.625, again 200 pieces for warehouse delivery.</p>
<h3>Overseas Yarn and Cotton Market Conditions Vary</h3>
<p>Too much rain in American cotton. Yesterday, American cotton was initially weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, but later it strengthened due to excessive rain and short covering. Futures prices rose and fell by 2-4 points. Spot prices were unchanged. English cotton futures and spot prices both fell by 4 points. Egyptian spot cotton prices fell by 5 points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original cable is recorded below (dated the 10th):</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea, Overseas Silk Cables Remain Unchanged Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign firm silk market in this city continued to be quiet and weak. This was due to the fluctuating European and American exchange rates. Overseas futures silk cables remained unchanged yesterday. New Zhejiang cocoons were on the market, but cocoon prices were not low, and silk costs were not loose. It was difficult to sell at a low price, and the attitude was passive. Yesterday, only Qianli Jinhu Factory entered the market for 20 bales, and prices remained weak.</p>
<h3>New Wenzhou Black Tea Arrives, Not Yet Opened for Trading</h3>
<p>Over 100 boxes of new Wenzhou black tea have been shipped to the Xinhechang Tea Firm in this city. However, British firms showed unusually little interest in buying, as British and Indian tea stocks were abundant and difficult to sell. As for the domestic Zhenmei green tea, there were also several hundred boxes of new samples on the market yesterday. Only Jinlong Foreign Firm and China Tea Company bought 113 boxes, and the prices were all low. Such a quiet new tea market has been rare in recent years.</p>
<h3>Abundant New Cocoon Harvest in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>In Hangzhou, Linping, and other places, farmers mostly raised improved silkworm varieties this year. Although the weather changed repeatedly during the process, making raising difficult for silkworm farmers, the resulting harvest was more abundant than in Haining, Yuhang, and other places, generally reaching 70-80% of a normal year. The cocoon quality was also good. Various cocoon firms have successively opened for purchases. The initial cocoon price was 50 yuan. On the second day, after viewing the goods, it opened at 55-58 yuan. On the third day, it returned to 54-55 yuan. Various firms are still actively buying.</p>
<h3>Food, Marked Increase in New and Old Flour Prices</h3>
<p>Most Active Buying in June</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market rose steadily, with each transaction at a higher price. This was because both near-term and far-term players seemed to have their own definite views. For the current month, manufacturers discarded futures contracts, leaving no room for maneuver for short sellers. Their intention was to prop up the market price. For the far-term months, the only basis for most people's decisions was half the support from rice prices and half the reliance on the weather. As the new wheat harvest was approaching, sunny skies were needed to ease people's concerns. Yesterday, however, the rain returned and the weather was unfavorable, so far-term prices also rose. In addition, June was the time when new and old crops were being discarded, and the standard market value was different from the future spot price, so buying was more active. As a result, the current month was 7.5 li better than the previous week's closing price, June was 1.2 li better, July and August were 5 li better, September was 7.5 li better, and October was 2.5 li better.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Ease Wheat Prices Due to Rain</h3>
<p>9,000 Bags of Spot Goods Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market turned positive, with foreign wheat prices rising by 2-3-5 jiao. Market sentiment was that the cold weather and continued rain strengthened the resolve of interior firms. Although the new wheat harvest could not yet be predicted, it seemed impossible for the interior to expect excessive bargains given the remarkably high rice prices. Therefore, there would have to be a significant change after rice prices eased or the new wheat harvest came in. As a result, June and July were 2 fen better than the previous weekend, August was 4 fen better, September was 1 fen better, and October was 3 fen better. For spot goods, large factories such as Fuxin and others were still keen on buying, so trucked goods were also quoted 2-3 fen higher. Medium-grade and lower-grade goods were also seen to be rising. Qingjiangpu, Suzhou, and Bengbu wheat were opened at 5 taels 7 fen, Hankou wheat at 4 taels 6 mace, 4 taels 5 mace 6 fen, and 4 taels 5 mace, Jiangxi wheat at 4 taels 9 mace 2 fen and 4 taels 7 mace, Hunan wheat at 4 taels 1 mace 7 fen, totaling 9,000 bags, which were purchased by Fuxin Factory.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>Medium-grade and Lower-grade Still Need to be Reduced... Nanshi Market Settles Universally</p>
<p>Yesterday, very few boats arrived in Zhabei from the interior, and the market was extremely sluggish. Top-grade Northern rice was gradually turning to mediocrity, as people's sentiments were not as strong as in the past, so ordinary types of rice showed clear price reductions. In fact, various parties were observing the situation with a wait-and-see attitude. Only fresh goods were traded slightly. As for old and lower-grade rice, the situation was even weaker, and prices continued to fall. The rice market sentiment had been sluggish for a long time, making it difficult to turn around. No one was interested in thin rice, and sales became even more sluggish. The overall market was weak, and the trend of Yang rice was softening. In addition, with scarce arrivals and depleted stocks, trade was even more bleak. Buying interest in Duzi sharp rice was slightly better, and prices were flat. The morning was slightly refreshing, but soon it subsided, and the Yin Yuan brand also felt lifeless.</p>
<p>The sources of rice down the river in South Shanghai were few. High-grade goods were the main sellers on this street. Changshu-Wuxi Northern rice was still acceptable to shops, and prices were stable. Suzhou-Tongji rice was also inquired about by rural villages, so the market was still strong. Overall, the rice market in this area was difficult to change. The sources of thin early rice in Xiaonan Bang were clear, and sales were also smooth. The market was neither up nor down. Customers were interested in the Yang and Duzi sharp rice, and foreign rice was still arriving, so prices were more stable than in the North market. Unprocessed fabric was not selling well, only rice sales were slightly active, and prices were flat due to scarce goods. The overall rice situation in the South market seemed extremely stable throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Yuan and Foreign Yarn Alone Are Selling Well in Piece Goods and Dong Goods</h3>
<p>Prices are Very High... Few Arrivals</p>
<p>The cotton cloth market in this factory has been falling recently. This is because it is the off-season, and holders are selling. Yesterday, fine cloth and coarse cloth of various brands all fell by about 5 fen. Fine twill and small twill were down by 2.5 fen. Inquiries for coarse twill were very quiet. Yihua striped bleached cloth had also fallen to 7 taels 2 mace, down 3 mace from the previous highest price. This was because the selling price of Dong Goods' striped Ting cloth was very cheap, and sales were being encroached upon. Dyed cloth, which had once been popular, was now also quiet, so fine cloth and fine twill were also difficult to excite.</p>
<p>There have been no major changes in the piece goods market for East and West Goods in recent days. However, the spot goods of Yuan and Foreign Yarn, which are Dong Goods, are still scarce. This is because the prices set this year are unprecedentedly high. It is feared that prices will fall after arrivals, so merchants are only slightly stocking up. Yesterday, Dian Qiuxiang rose again by 5 fen and sold for 8 taels and a half. First-grade Fugui was 8 taels 2 mace and a half. Other goods were all soft. Changbanqiao Zhigongni has fallen by 2.5 li since arriving. Printed crepe cloth has all fallen to 2 taels 3 mace and a half. White crepe cloth has also become slightly weaker, and sales are still intermittent on this street. Customers have uniformly stopped. Western Goods, blue-striped hemp yarn, has had some transactions with interior firms. Good Hua Deer brand was 2 mace 1 fen. Xinyi Goods was 2 mace. Woven foreign yarn fell by 5 li yesterday.</p>
<h3>Base Metals, Military-Use Base Metals Being Exported Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were large transactions in military-use base metals such as No. 12 and No. 14 new lead wire, three-sheet black iron sheet, red copper, green lead, and garden lead wire. Prices were 2 mace to 1 liang higher than the previous day. It was found that this batch of goods was mostly released by base metal firms in the French Concession and would be packed for export tomorrow.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange rate has been continuously compressing in recent days, and the cost of base metals has been invisibly increased. Therefore, the domestic trend is very strong, and the surface asking price at tea parties has also been raised by several mace. Although actual business has not opened much for a while, the atmosphere in the market is much better than before.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee</h3>
<p>Telegram of Condolences to Frontline Soldiers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee issued a telegram yesterday to console the frontline soldiers who were suppressing the rebellion, saying: To the Commander-in-Chief of the National Revolutionary Army of Nanjing and the soldiers at the front, it is known that Feng and Yan are remnants of warlords, a collection of reactionaries, with long-held schemes and no integrity. They are opportunists mixed into our party, making false statements to confuse public opinion. They only know how to expand their own territory, disregarding the interests of the party, the country, and the people, and arbitrarily extorting, causing popular resentment to boil over. Sending generals and mobilizing troops is an open act of betrayal. If Qingfu is not removed, the troubles of Lu will not end. If the chief culprit is brought to justice, the country will be at peace. This is what the people of the whole country hate and what the revolutionary soldiers deeply resent. Now, our central government is launching a large-scale campaign to quell the chaos and pacify the people. Millions of soldiers are marching forward with weapons. At this time, when the reactionaries are arrogant and the party and the country are in crisis, all our revolutionary soldiers should uphold the glorious history of the past to build the final great achievements. Be firm, persevering, and courageous, with a determination to live and die together. Fight with the spirit of destroying the enemy in the morning and take righteousness and sacrifice as your purpose. Let the foxes and rabbits in the four suburbs of Yan, Qi, Qin, and Jin be captured, and the waves on the Yangtze and Huai Rivers be calmed. The party, representing the people, is willing to see your great achievements. When you return victoriously, we will hold a celebration meeting. We hereby send a telegram of condolences and look forward to good news. Shanghai Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang</p>

<h3>Mongolian Leagues and Banners</h3>
<p>Delegation Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Fifty-one Representatives from Five Leagues to Proceed to Beijing Today</p>
<p>The central government will convene a Mongolian and Tibetan conference and has already telegraphed the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to urge the leagues and banners of Inner Mongolia and Tibet to promptly send representatives to Beijing for the timely holding of the conference. Various tribes such as the Ikhe League, An Banner, and Zhaoud League of Mongolia have all elected representatives who will travel from the Liaoning area, passing through South Manchuria, taking a sea route to Shanghai, and then proceeding to Beijing. Yesterday, a delegation of representatives from five leagues and banners, totaling fifty-one people, arrived in Shanghai on the Japanese ship "Dalian Maru" at 4:30 PM. When the delegation passed through Dong Province, the Liaoning authorities provided hospitality. Commander Zhang Hanqing also specially appointed Li Chunfang, the provincial committee member of Jilin Province, and Secretary Qian Junren, along with representatives of various clans, to accompany them to Shanghai and proceed to the central government. Yesterday afternoon, when the ship arrived in Shanghai, all the representatives disembarked at the Huishan Wharf.

<h3>Public Concession Tramways</h3>
<p>Resumption of Work Suspended Yesterday</p>
<p>News from the Workers' Side: Continued Strike Today</p>
<p>Public Concession tram workers initially resumed work yesterday morning due to the police and the company agreeing to acknowledge minimum demands such as wage increases. This indicated the workers' sincerity in negotiations. However, the majority of workers gathered at 8:00 AM yesterday (the 12th) at the intersection of Dalian Bay Road and Yulin Road for a mass meeting, awaiting the company's written acceptance of their conditions. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 AM, representatives and over six hundred coppersmiths marched from the New Station's mechanical department, lining up and reporting to the nine hundred plus tram drivers, ticket sellers, track maintenance workers, lamplighters, and gatekeepers gathered at the wasteland on Yulin Road that after the workers arrived at the company, the manager not only refused to accept the minimum five demands but also rescinded the previously announced wage increase of three yuan. The more than sixteen hundred workers present were extremely indignant and unanimously resolved: (1) To insist on the minimum five demands: 1. Wage increase of three yuan per person per month; 2. Wages to be paid as usual during the strike period; 3. Wages to be paid as usual for weekly rest; those who work on rest days to receive double wages; 4. Release of arrested workers; 5. Rice subsidy of three yuan per person per month. No resumption of work until the conditions are met; (2) To stage a parade and demonstration, intercepting trams that have already departed; (3) To severely beat scabs and lackeys. Thereupon, the crowd marched, passing through Tilanqiao, Baidu Bridge, and the Bund to Hongkou, chanting various slogans along the way, intercepting trams on routes 6, 7, 8, and 9 that had already departed, bringing them to a standstill on the tracks for several miles. All workers at the New Station unanimously declared a continuation of the strike to fight for their demands. Upon receiving the news, some of the workers at the Old Station who had resumed work immediately sent people to report to the strike committee and voluntarily returned the trams early. They will continue the strike today. Yesterday, the strike committee issued a letter to all workers and a letter to compatriots from all walks of life, stating that the continued strike was a last resort.</p>
<p>News from the Company Side</p>
<p>Dawanbao reports: After the Public Concession tram workers' strike was resolved yesterday afternoon (the 11th), all trams and trolleybuses resumed operation this morning (the 12th). By approximately 10:00 AM, four hundred and eight drivers, seven hundred and seventy ticket sellers, and one hundred and sixty-two gatekeepers had resumed work. However, after 10:00 AM, because the mechanics at the Baker Road factory were still dissatisfied, tram services in the Yangshupu and Tilanqiao areas were suspended again. Company officials hope to resolve this matter before tomorrow morning so that tram services in that area can also resume. The resolution reached yesterday afternoon was achieved after a lengthy negotiation between eight worker representatives and the factory management at the Hardoon Road factory. The company agreed to: (1) Increase the monthly salary of all drivers, ticket sellers, and other workers by three yuan, and provide an additional rice subsidy of three yuan; (2) Pay half wages during the strike period; (3) Increase the monthly salary of mechanics by 90 cents. The company argued that the mechanics had already received an increase of two yuan and ten cents in January of this year, so it only agreed to an increase of 90 cents. The workers insisted that everyone should receive an increase of three yuan, and the mechanics felt even more dissatisfied. This is currently the only point of contention among the workers, which is why there were further disruptions this morning. Other minor conditions were sometimes acknowledged and sometimes rejected. As for the public buses, the drivers are determined not to resume work unless a further wage increase is granted, and the company is equally determined to refuse a wage increase. Therefore, both sides remain deadlocked. Currently, fourteen buses are running on the Jing'an Temple to Baida Bridge route, and it is hoped that two more routes can be added tomorrow.</p>
<p>Wenhuibao reports: This morning (the 12th) at 10:00 AM, the Public Concession trams resumed operation, but soon after, mechanics from the company created trouble for drivers and others on various routes in the Tilanqiao and Yangshupu districts, causing the tram services in that area to be suspended again between 11:00 AM and noon. Two mechanics were arrested.</p>

According to Mr. Ren, the office is still operating as usual and there are no plans to downsize or close it down, nor are there any plans to reorganize it and change its name. On the afternoon of the 10th, the office held a meeting to find ways to reduce public expenditure, salaries, and military pay to avoid deficits and arrears. As for the method of reduction, it was decided not to pay salaries to those who do not regularly come to the office to work, and the office has never paid salaries to personnel who have not yet taken office. How much will be saved after the cuts in the future is currently being calculated and is not yet known. When asked when Naval Minister Yang Shuzhuang would leave Shanghai, the answer was that it had not yet been determined, and the rumor that he would go to Fujian tomorrow was not true.</p>

<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, in addition to instructing various rice depots in the city to fill out report forms, also sends personnel to investigate daily in order to verify the stored rice situation. According to the results of the investigation and reports, from April 1st to May 10th, various rice depots have a total of 614,816 bags of rice stored, of which 614,113 bags are foreign rice. The foreign rice is mostly controlled by foreigners, such as Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, Société Franco-Chinoise of France, Jardine Matheson of England, etc. There are also three or four Chinese rice merchants who, although they appear to be independent, are actually secretly colluding and inevitably engage in roundabout buying and selling. The following table is provided for the reference of those who are concerned about the people's livelihood:</p>

After leading the ceremony, staff member Zhang Qingyu spoke about nationalism, followed by a speech by the Deputy Commander, who stated: "The purpose of our revolution is to overthrow imperialism and warlords in order to achieve freedom and equality for China. After a long struggle by our party, we have just achieved some progress. However, remnant warlords such as Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang are again resorting to arms, undermining unification, obstructing construction, directly increasing the suffering of the people, and indirectly creating opportunities for imperialists. Their intentions are particularly hateful. In addition, communist bandits in various places are specializing in causing trouble in the rear, disrupting social order, and are also enemies of the people and obstacles to the revolution. At this critical time of suppressing the remnant warlords, we must especially eliminate the communist bandits by any means necessary. Therefore, the National Government has ordered me to concurrently serve as the Commander-in-Chief of the Communist Suppression in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. When the General Headquarters is established in the future, we will carefully plan to clear the communist bandits in the three provinces within a limited time, so that the people in the rear can live and work in peace, and the soldiers at the front can fight with peace of mind. This will be considered fulfilling our responsibility. In the future, most of the work will still be handled by the personnel of this headquarters. I hope that everyone will work hard."</p>

<h3>Difficulty for Transportation Industry to Transport Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway transportation companies, due to the famine in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces last year, have seen a sharp rise in rice prices, which are related to the people's livelihood. The gentry and merchants of the two provinces have pooled funds to order a large batch of foreign rice from Siam and other places, totaling more than one million dan. The foreign rice has been successively transported to Shanghai by sea and reported by various transportation companies to be loaded and transported along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway lines for sale at low prices to aid the people's livelihood. More than 100,000 dan of foreign rice have now arrived and are stored in various warehouses at Maigen Road, Rihui Port South Station, and other freight yards along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou Railway. There is an urgent need for carriages to load and transport the rice. However, the railway bureau lacks carriages to dispatch, some of which have been borrowed for military purposes and not yet returned. Various transportation companies convened a meeting of their colleagues at the Transportation and Transit Association to discuss solutions to the shortage of carriages. They telegraphed the Ministry of Railways and forwarded a request to the Ministry of Military Affairs to order the commercial allocation of carriages and locomotives to be returned to the railway bureau as soon as possible to facilitate rapid transportation and aid the people's livelihood. In recent days, although the two railways have tried to allocate carriages, each day Xie Daxing, Tongdachang, Tongligong, Qianda, Yongxing Maoxing, and other transportation companies have loaded eight or nine thousand shi or ten thousand shi, which is still not enough for transportation. As a result, the warehouses at Maigen Road and Rihui Port stations are piled up like mountains. Therefore, the rice merchants responsible for the transportation telegraphed overseas to temporarily suspend shipments to Shanghai because there is no place to store the rice in Shanghai. They will telegraph overseas again after the accumulated goods have been transported and circulation has resumed.</p>
<h3>Public Omnibus Company of the Public Concession Declaration</h3>
<p>Attached: Seven Articles of Resumption of Work Conditions</p>
<p>The Public Omnibus Company of the Public Concession issues a declaration regarding the strike, stating: "Since the bus drivers' strike began, no fewer than six or seven million Chinese passengers have been inconvenienced every day. Therefore, the public also wants to know the company's policy in dealing with the strike. We hereby state the facts and hope for your consideration. The company has always strived to meet the needs of its employees to the best of its ability within a possible scope. Recently, in view of the increase in rice prices and the general cost of living, the company took the initiative to increase the salaries of all employees, which was met with satisfaction by most of them. However, the drivers continued to demand further salary increases, and the company informed them that it was difficult to agree. Therefore, on April 19, they went on strike as a whole. In addition to salary increases, the drivers also demanded two other things: 1. The engine does not need to be stopped when the bus reaches the end of the line; 2. The bus schedule does not need to be fixed according to the schedule.</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>May 13th, Nineteenth Year of the Republic of China</p>
<p>It can be said with certainty that if these two requirements are approved, it will be difficult to plan the effectiveness of the bus operation. As for the driver's salary, since joining the company and obtaining a driver's license, the monthly salary is 27 yuan. Thereafter, for every year of service, the monthly salary increases by two yuan. Three days of rest are given each month with full pay. If one pays attention to the job, there are opportunities to increase income, such as drivers who are careful and pay attention to the engine so that fuel is saved can get a bonus of up to two jiao of silver per day. Also, for drivers who strictly adhere to the schedule, they can get a bonus of two to ten yuan per month. Also, for drivers who are careful and do not cause accidents, they will be rewarded in three levels. Those who do not cause accidents within one month will receive a special reward of one yuan. Those who do not cause accidents within one quarter will receive an additional reward of five yuan. Those who do not cause accidents within one year will receive an additional six yuan. Therefore, if the driver is careful, he can get a total bonus of 38 yuan per year. The company has now indicated that it can appropriately increase this special reward so that those who do not cause accidents throughout the year can get a bonus of 48 yuan. This bonus is not difficult to get. Currently, about 50% of the drivers can get a monthly reward, and many can get an annual reward. Therefore, if you can drive carefully, it is not difficult for everyone to get it. Currently, some drivers with excellent skills can earn up to 50 or 60 yuan per month, and even the least skilled drivers can work hard and diligently to seek progress and increase their income. Recently, there have been rumors that the company has hired Russians to replace the striking Chinese drivers, which is not entirely true. Since it is one of the public utility services, it should maintain its services in every possible way. The Chinese drivers, disregarding the inconvenience to the public, took this extremely serious step and went on strike together, hoping to completely obstruct the company's services. Therefore, the company should take the opportunity to recruit Russians. However, in the future, Russian drivers and Chinese drivers will be used together because the new cars ordered by the company have already been delivered and additional drivers need to be hired. As for the conditions for the workers to resume work that have now been notified: (1) The accident-free bonus will be appropriately increased so that a total of 48 yuan can be obtained throughout the year; (2) Original salary will be paid from the date of resumption of work; (3) No wages will be paid during the strike period; (4) The salary increase method will be as promised: those with a monthly salary between 20 yuan and 30 yuan will be increased by two yuan, and those with a monthly salary between 30 yuan and 50 yuan will be increased by three yuan; (5) Drivers must strictly adhere to the schedule; (6) The engine must be stopped when the bus reaches the end of the line; (7) The subsidy money stored under the names of the strikers will be confiscated. This subsidy money is set aside by the company for the benefit of employees, and the company will set aside another 5% of their salary each month for storage. However, according to Article 5 of the savings regulations, anyone who joins the strike movement will be confiscated. Therefore, this time, the regulations must be followed. However, the above-mentioned conditions cannot be unlimited, so if the strikers do not resume work within a reasonable period, the company will have to recruit new people to carry out training, and thereafter, they will lose the opportunity to resume work. In short, the company's treatment of drivers is already very good in view of the various points mentioned above, and there is really no reason to complain. Therefore, their strike is due to believing in bad advice and acting recklessly. If they persist, they will only suffer greater disadvantages."</p>
<h3>Two Postal Workers' Unions Submit a Document to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Regarding the Appointment of Personnel by the Directorate General of Posts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Workers' Union and the Postal Workers' Union jointly submitted a document to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Examination Yuan, and the Ministry of Communications, stating: "The Directorate General of Posts has, without examination, arbitrarily appointed many assistants and clerks, violating the party's program and undermining the foundation of the postal service. We earnestly request that you issue a clear order to instruct the Directorate General of Posts to rescind the appointments and investigate the responsible authorities in order to maintain party policy and clean up official affairs. According to reports, the Directorate General of Posts has implemented two new policies: one is to hire Wang et al. as assistants with salaries ranging from 500 yuan to 300 yuan, with four to ten positions; the other is to hire a large number of clerks with monthly salaries of 160 yuan, increasing to 280 yuan per year. All of the above-mentioned personnel have not been examined. After detailed investigation, the above-mentioned facts have been confirmed. The unions were shocked and alarmed upon hearing the news, and all agreed that this initiative of the Directorate General of Posts not only undermines the foundation of the postal service but also violates the Three Principles of the People. Its impact on the foundation of the country and party discipline is indeed not insignificant. The unions, representing all postal workers, have been urged by the members not to remain silent and will present these points of objection to the Directorate General of Posts' appointment of personnel one by one. First, Dr. Sun Yat-sen created the Five-Power Constitution and listed examination as one of the powers in order to select true talents and cleanse officialdom. Article 5 of the Internal Affairs Declaration of the National Congress has also been stipulated separately. Now that the period of political tutelage has begun and the five yuans have been established, the Examination Yuan has established a test</p>
<p>trial committee. Examinations for county magistrates and assistants in various provinces have also been implemented one after another. The political future is indeed gratifying, and the postal service, which has been vigorously implementing the examination system for more than 30 years, has instead undermined it at this time. This is truly intolerable in terms of the principles and disciplines. This is the first objection to the Directorate General of Posts' appointment of personnel. Second, Article 3 of the Regulations of the Directorate General of Posts states that item 6 for staff positions is assistant and item 9 states that the staff under the General Director of Posts shall be filled by postal service staff. So it is clear that assistants must be postal personnel. Also, Article 10 states that the General Director of Posts may set up two to four secretaries and may employ several clerks to handle clerical affairs. According to legal practice, those listed can be hired, and those not listed should not exist. The Directorate General of Posts has already had four or five secretaries and several clerks, but it has appointed many assistants and clerks outside of the statutory regulations, which is a violation of the law and an exercise of authority. This is the second objection to the Directorate General of Posts' appointment of personnel. Third, in terms of the current political trend and the internal situation of the post office, the Executive Yuan of the National Government recently issued a notice to all agencies across the country to dismiss redundant personnel and reduce expenses. The Directorate General of Posts is also a national agency and should comply with it. The postal service of China has been established for more than 30 years, and the postal rights have been recovered for more than two years. The public documents (Chinese and foreign documents) and internal and external communications have all been handled by the bureau staff, and they are all more than capable. The post office has recruited talents from each branch of the bureau staff, including Chinese and English, with degrees that have the potential for innovation. Therefore, they are all quite rich in academic theory and experience, and can perform official duties capably. There are also document talents like Han Wu among them, and there are also those who have served as consuls and postal assistants. They are all rich in specialized postal knowledge. The Directorate General of Posts wants clerical and assistant personnel, but it can select personnel from the service staff to any extent that is not enough to draw on. It must search far and wide to spend a huge amount of money to arbitrarily add unnecessary and useless railway engineers and redundant personnel who have no postal service experience and occupy positions without doing anything. This is a violation of orders and a disregard for laws and disciplines. This is the third objection to the Directorate General of Posts' appointment of personnel. Fourth, the post office staff have always been promoted through accumulating experience. Therefore, the salary when first entering the bureau is very small. The fastest way to enjoy the treatment of a deputy director of postal affairs and receive a thick salary of 300 or 400 yuan or more is to serve in the post office for 20 or 30 years. According to the current year's employee promotion, those with a grade of over 100 yuan will be eligible from a year and a half to two or three years. Now, the newly appointed personnel will receive huge salaries of 160 yuan, 350 yuan, or 500 yuan upon entering the bureau, and there is also a special permit to advance each year. In two years, they will be officially appointed as deputy director of postal affairs. It is predetermined that those who accumulate merit and are capable will receive a late and thin reward, and those who rush around and gain favor will receive an extraordinary promotion. It is not only that the employee debt cannot be flattened, but it also opens a path for flattery. What can the future look like? The post office's operations are strange, and its upper and lower levels are breaking down. This is the fourth objection to the Directorate General of Posts' appointment of personnel. In summary, the four objections are sufficient to show that the Directorate General of Posts' arbitrary appointment of clerical assistants and other personnel is not only contrary to party policy but also violates postal regulations. There is a suspicion of wantonly increasing redundant personnel and facilitating private plans. The unions cannot bear to sit idly by and see the postal service, which has just been recovered, and fear that even a slight difference will lead to a great loss. It is a small matter that damages the dignity of the country and a major matter that affects social communication. The unions are deeply worried and are making a loud appeal, hoping to turn the tide before it's too late. In addition to presenting this document separately, we hereby submit another request to your department (government)(yuan) to consider the difficulty of construction and the spirit of the five powers, and to issue a clear order to investigate and instruct the Directorate General of Posts to rescind the arbitrary appointment of assistants and clerks within a certain date in order to maintain the postal system and promote party rule. We present this document with the utmost urgency, etc."</p>
<h3>Public Concession Council Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Five Chinese Directors to Attend Unanimously</p>
<p>The Public Concession Council will hold its first meeting tomorrow (Wednesday) at 4:30 PM. Director-General Edward has issued a formal notice. Since the issue of the number of Chinese directors on the Public Concession Council arose, a gathering was held</p>
<p>meeting. At that time, the five Chinese directors unanimously did not attend because the issue had not been resolved.

<h3>The Municipal Government's</h3>
<p>Reply Regarding the Handling of Immigrants from Zhejiang Province</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Government yesterday provided a written reply to the Zhejiang Provincial Government regarding the handling of immigrants from Zhejiang Province, stating: "Regarding your request, as per your Civil Affairs document No. 93, to send immigrants from the Northeast to Shanghai for transportation to the Northeast for land reclamation, and to appoint Commissioner Zhou Baidong to be responsible for liaison, etc., we have ordered the Public Security Bureau to comply and have replied in writing. Now, according to the bureau's report, upon receiving the order and after Commissioner Zhou Baidong of the Zhejiang Provincial Government came to the bureau and stated that the immigrants were scheduled to arrive in Shanghai, they had independently secured the Chaozhou Guildhall for temporary accommodation. Regarding the exemption of transportation fees for the voyages from Shanghai to the north, they had also independently negotiated a compromise. However, for the voyages from Zhejiang to Shanghai on the Yili, Dahua, Chuanshan, Zhoushan, Taizhou, and Daxing shipping companies' vessels, please have the bureau dispatch personnel to jointly negotiate a solution," etc. We ordered Gong Yushuo, the director of the Relief Section of the bureau's Second Department, to jointly meet with Commissioner Zhou and, together with the captain of the Water Patrol Team, to carry a letter to the Shanghai Shipping Association to discuss the matter. Subsequently, the Shanghai Shipping Association replied that this matter had been presented to the various members and jointly consulted with the Navigation Affairs Bureau. The result was that for voyages from Zhejiang Province, Haimen, Shipu, Dinghai, and Chuanshan to Shanghai, the Zhoushan, Dahua, Chuanshan, Daxing, and Taizhou shipping lines would be responsible for transportation. For voyages from Wenzhou Kanmen, the Yili shipping line would be responsible. All fares would be reduced by half, with children under seven years old being free, and those seven years and older paying full fare. The number of immigrants would be tallied according to the immigrant roster when they boarded the ships, and the cash would be paid by the county governments at that time. Please forward this information to the Zhejiang Provincial Government for notification to the Yongjia, Linhai, Dinghai, Xiangshan, and Zhenhai county governments to ensure uniformity." In addition to instructing the Water Patrol Team to provide proper accommodation, we are submitting a written report on the handling of the matter for your review and transmission to the public for their information.</p>

<h3>Silkworm Cocoons Will Soon Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Producers are unwilling to sell cheap, making it difficult for cocoon merchants to purchase them.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway is transporting this year's spring cocoons from various areas of Zhejiang Province, which have now entered the market. The first batch of sample cocoons was transferred by the Huitong Transport Company from Gongchen Bridge a few days ago, intending to be shipped to Shanghai. It is learned that yesterday, the company continued to load two packages of sample cocoons from Chang'an Station, which were purchased by the Xieda and Housheng cocoon firms and transported to the Shanghai Xiechang Silk Factory. It is reported that the earliest weighing and purchasing of the first cocoons in Chang'an, Gongchen, Yuhang, Linping, and other places began on the 11th of this month, with the price of the first-grade cocoons being 60 yuan per dan and the second-grade cocoons being over 50 yuan per dan (according to the negotiated price of the Silk Cocoon Association, the first grade is 50 yuan and the second grade is 40 yuan). However, when the cocoon merchants set up shops in the interior to purchase the cocoons, the local producers and landowners are generally unwilling to sell them at a low price. Therefore, it is quite difficult for the cocoon merchants to purchase goods, and the market price has risen. It is expected that whole batches of cocoon packages will only be loaded and transported to Shanghai around tomorrow or the day after.</p>

<h3>Freight Cars Collide Outside Kuatang Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Switchman Drowses and is Negligent, Driver Speeds Excessively; Stationmaster's Warning is Too Late; Fortunately, Damage is Minor</p>
<p>At 4:26 AM yesterday morning, the 39th northbound and 34th southbound freight trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway collided outside Kuatang Station. Fortunately, there was no major damage, and traffic was not disrupted. The details of the collision are described below:</p>
<p>Switchman Drowses: At 4:30 AM yesterday (12th), after the 39th northbound freight train arrived at Kuatang Station, it was scheduled to stop at the station to exchange with the 32nd freight train from Nanjing to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the 39th northbound freight train entered Kuatang Station as usual and stopped on the siding. Shortly after, the 32nd southbound train departed from Suzhou and passed through the station on the main line around 4:10 AM. However, the 34th southbound freight train was not delayed yesterday, so after the 32nd train passed through Kuatang, the Suzhou Stationmaster telegraphed the Kuatang Station to request a track warrant to release the train to Kuatang Station to exchange with the 39th northbound freight train. After issuing the track warrant to Suzhou Station, the Kuatang Stationmaster used light signals to notify the east and west switchmen to switch the tracks to the main line, as usual. Unexpectedly, the switchman at the west end mistakenly thought that after the 32nd freight train passed, the 39th freight train should be released to the Suzhou track, so he switched the track to the siding and dozed off in the switchman's shed. He did not see any warning lights or signals.</p>
<p>Stationmaster's Belated Remedy: When the stationmaster saw that the west switchman did not respond, he immediately sent a station worker to check, and at the same time placed the danger signal flags inside and outside the west end of the station so that the driver of the oncoming train could see it and stop. However, the speed of the 34th freight train yesterday morning seemed to be faster than usual. When the station worker was halfway there, the train was unable to stop and crashed into the siding with the 39th train. The driver on the train quickly closed the throttle, so the impact was light. The time was 4:26 AM.</p>
<p>Railway Personnel Survey the Scene: After the stationmaster saw the accident, he immediately telegraphed Shanghai North Station to report the accident and requested a rescue train to be sent. After receiving the telegram, the Shanghai station immediately notified the leaders to investigate and arrange for rescue. Zheng Baozhao, the deputy chief of the railway's transportation department, Li Songbai, the night shift transportation inspector of the eastern section, Yang Xiaozeng, the transportation inspector of the Kuang section, and Mu Erhui, the director of the Wusong Factory, and other leaders of the Shanghai section of the transportation department, rushed to the station after hearing the news and took the rescue train to Kuatang Station, departing from North Station at 7:32 AM.</p>
<p>Damage is Minor: After the leaders arrived at Kuatang Station, they immediately investigated the cause of the accident and the damage, and arranged for clearing the tracks. They saw that the front car of the 39th train, a 40-ton covered wagon No. 595, had its front and rear couplers broken and the car body slightly damaged. The front two cars of the 34th freight train, 30-ton covered wagons No. 64 and 238, also had their front and rear couplers broken. The two locomotives were also slightly damaged, but the rest were not affected, and the roadbed and other things were intact.</p>
<p>Night Train Delayed: The night passenger train from Beijing had already arrived at Suzhou Station. After learning that the accident had occurred at the station ahead, the train had to be temporarily detained in Suzhou. One of the locomotives on the passenger train was detached and sent to Kuatang Station to tow the rear cars of the 34th freight train to Suzhou Station. Then the locomotive was reattached to the night train and passed through Kuatang Station on the main line to Shanghai. Therefore, the train arrived in Shanghai two hours late yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Rescue Train's Work: All the cars with broken couplers were first uncoupled by the rescue train, and then the two locomotives were connected and towed to the Wusong Factory for repair. The siding at the station was completely cleared by 3 PM and traffic was restored. All passenger trains were running smoothly as usual without any obstruction or delay. The rescue train and the leaders of the railway returned to Shanghai by train in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Responsibility of Those Involved: Zheng Baozhao, Deputy Chief of the Railway's Transportation Department, immediately summoned all those involved at Kuatang Station for questioning after the incident. It is said that the switchman at the station and the driver of the 39th freight train should share the blame for this incident. Although the switchman was lazy and fell asleep while on duty, causing the mistake, the driver of the 34th freight train should not have disobeyed the signals and rushed into the station. Moreover, according to the schedule, the freight train from Suzhou to Kuatang Station should take 26 minutes, but yesterday morning the train only took 17 minutes from Suzhou to Kuatang Station, so its speeding may also have been one of the causes of the accident.</p>
<h3>Son Accused of Being Unfilial</h3>
<p>Mother's Deep Love for Her Son, Wants to Drop the Case; Father Asks for the Trial to Continue to Maintain Ethical Norms</p>
<p>Huang Jiaji from Ningbo was accused of being unfilial to his parents and was sued in the Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ge Zhitan opened the court. The defendant was absent. According to the plaintiffs Huang Weiwei and Xiong, residents of No. 72, Minhou North Lane, An'nan Road, they accused their son of disobeying their instructions and verbally abusing them, and they even wanted to commit murder, leaving them with no other option but to sue. According to the defendant's mother, Huang Dong, "My son has a mental illness. He is indeed disrespectful to his elders, but my husband did not consult me before filing this lawsuit, and I only learned about it after receiving the summons." Judge Ge persuaded the plaintiff not to sue, saying that if he insisted on punishing his son, he would inevitably regret it in the future. Upon hearing this, she was moved by her deep love for her son and requested that the defendant no longer be summoned. However, Huang Weiwei insisted on continuing the trial to maintain ethical norms. The court then ordered an adjournment to wait for the defendant to be summoned for questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Severed Child's Body is Not a Murder Victim</h3>
<p>Abandoned in the Wilderness After Illness, Body Eaten by Dogs; Canine Tooth Marks Found on the Neck; Unknown Whose Child Was Abandoned</p>
<p>The discovery of a dismembered child's body on a wasteland on Moganshan Road in western Shanghai was reported yesterday. It is now known that the first discovery at 6:30 AM the day before yesterday was only the head of a child. Upon receiving the report, the Pudu Road Police Station dispatched Detective Ma Zonglai to investigate with a Western detective. At first, only a head was found. By 11:30 AM, Detective Ma found a section of the body about 400 yards from Tokyo Road. The abdomen was empty, and the intestines were missing. Canine tooth marks were also found on the neck. The hands and feet were then gathered one by one and put together with the head to form a complete child's body. According to the results of the police investigation, it was determined that the child had been abandoned in the wilderness after dying of illness and was eaten by dogs, resulting in the dismembered body. However, it was impossible to determine whose child had been abandoned. The police then carried the child's body to the autopsy room on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, the Special District Court was requested to appoint Prosecutor Xu to conduct an autopsy. After a clear examination, he instructed the Pushan Villa to collect and bury the body.</p>
<h3>A Police Officer is Accused of Bribery in a Case of Forcing a Woman into Prostitution</h3>
<p>The trial is postponed for questioning by the original judge; a Western detective testifies that the officer was falsely accused</p>
<p>A woman, Liu Yu, was previously accused by the Laozha Police Station of forcing a woman into prostitution. When Judge Xu Jiashi of the Special District Court heard the case, the woman accused Zhao Rongsheng, a Chinese detective at the Laozha Police Station, of soliciting a bribe of 100 yuan from her. Therefore, the case was suspended due to the bribery issue, pending resolution of the incident before further inquiry. Yesterday morning, Detective Zhao was prosecuted by the police station. Judge Zhou opened the trial. The defendant hired lawyer Jiang Baoli to defend him. First, the police station lawyer, Gan Jingxian, stated that Yuan Wu had fled to Shanghai due to a disagreement with her husband and became a prostitute in Liu Yu's brothel at No. 266, Guangxi Road. Later, Yuan Wu's husband filed a lawsuit with the local government in Changzhou, requesting the court's assistance in transferring the case. The court issued a warrant to arrest Yuan Wu, and the police station filed a public prosecution against Liu Yu. When the court opened the case, Liu Yu confessed that Zhao Rongsheng, the detective in charge of the case, had accepted a bribe of 100 yuan from her. Therefore, Zhao was also formally prosecuted. However, since the previous case was heard by Judge Xu, in order to facilitate clarity, it was requested that this case also be heard by Judge Xu. Lawyer Jiang immediately stated that since the case must be postponed, it was requested that the defendant be allowed to be released on bail because the defendant was actually falsely accused. According to the plaintiff's statement, the alleged bribery occurred on the morning of the fourth day, but the defendant was actually working at the police station that day. A Western detective, Hills, could prove this, which alone was enough to show that the bribery never occurred. Judge Zhou approved the defendant's lawyer's request and ordered Zhao Rongsheng to post a cash bail of 500 yuan and be released pending further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Russian is a Habitual Offender</h3>
<p>Has Been Punished 36 Times; Municipal Council Has Also Provided Him with Work</p>
<p>Russian Hai Shengsi, 35 years old, was arrested yesterday for begging from pedestrians on Broadway Road and detained in the Hongkou Police Station. Under investigation, it was learned that Hai has been punished a total of 36 times from August 13, 1925, to the present day, including two attempts at suicide, 21 cases of begging, 10 cases of drunkenness, and three cases of trespassing into occupied residences. Moreover, the Municipal Council had introduced Hai to work at the electricity department, but he continued to drink and make trouble, failing to work, which led to his dismissal. In this situation, Hai is indeed a habitual offender. The police chief then ordered him to be detained pending transfer to the Special District Court for severe punishment.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Aphrodisiacs</h3>
<p>Harmful to People, Corrupting Morals; Police Raid and Confiscate All</p>
<p>The Special Municipal Public Security and Education Bureaus believe that the medicines sold by the Ellis Pharmacy on Nanjing Road in the Public Concession are mostly aphrodisiacs, which have a significant impact on society, directly harming young people and indirectly corrupting morals. If they are not strictly prohibited, the harm will be immeasurable. Therefore, Bureau Chiefs Yuan and Chen jointly requested the Special District Court to cooperate in suppressing them. President Yang issued a search warrant the day before yesterday, ordering the police station to dispatch Chinese and Western detectives to raid the pharmacy. A large number of aphrodisiacs were found, including 26 packages of glans enlargement devices, 7 packages of self-healing reproductive devices, 267 packages of anti-poisoning pleasure devices, 19 pessaries, 210 "Beauty Fun" devices, 482 "Protecting Lin" devices, 56 "Charm Ancestor" devices, 323 invigorating pills, 230 "Diamond Powder" devices, 100 packets of contraceptives, and 100 packages of seed medicine. All the responsible personnel of the pharmacy were out, and none were arrested. Yesterday morning, the police sent the large quantity of aphrodisiacs to the Special District Court. The pharmacy hired two lawyers, Fan Gang and others, to defend them. After Judge Shen questioned them about the search, he ordered that all the seized prohibited items be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities Reorganizes Bus Stops in Southern Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in view of the fact that the locations of bus stops on various routes in southern Shanghai are not very suitable given the current traffic situation, and that the distances between them and tram stops are often too close, obstructing traffic, deems it necessary to thoroughly reorganize them. It dispatched personnel to survey and determine the locations for relocation, and on May 2, consulted with the Public Works Bureau and reached a consensus. It then drew up a list and ordered the companies to relocate the stops within a specified period. A total of 16 stops on Routes 1 and 2 need to be relocated. For Route 13 and Route 19, in the section of the double-track tramway of the China Merchants Electricity Company at the intersection of Xuejiabang Wai Ma Road, the bureau believes that changing trolleybuses there is inconvenient for traffic and ordered the China Merchants Electricity Company to remove it and move it 15 meters away from the intersection, and to interchange the tram stop locations with the bus stops in order to facilitate traffic flow.</p>
<h3>The Junhe Warship Cruises Outside the Port</h3>
<p>To Protect Fishing Boats</p>
<p>Pirates have become more rampant recently in the waters outside Wusong Port, near Rugao and Haimen. Most of the fishing boats of various gangs from Wusong that go to the Shandong waters to fish and return fully loaded are looted. Zhu Junfu, the district chief of the Fourth District of the Wusong Water Police, reported that the jurisdiction was vast and the police force was weak, and requested the provincial government to send a warship to suppress them. The Department of Civil Affairs has sent the Junhe warship to cruise in the waters there.</p>
<h3>Negotiations Regarding the Injury of a Chinese Woman by a French National</h3>
<p>A French national, Meishan Liya (transliteration, residing in Room 224 of the Youli Hotel, Tiantang Street), was hunting birds behind the Fahua Temple in western Shanghai with a German national, Duai (transliteration, residing at No. 121, Yaozhujiao Road, French Concession), at around 5:30 PM the day before yesterday. Wang Zhou, a woman living in a nearby shack, was working in the field when she was hit in the head and chest by stray bullets and fell to the ground in extreme pain. Shi Hegen, the patrol chief of the local police station, rushed to the scene after hearing the news, but the French national who caused the accident, Meishan Liya, had already escaped. The German national, Duai, along with a shotgun and 21 bullets, were detained and taken to the Second Branch of the Sixth District. Wang Zhou, the injured woman, was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. Although her injuries were not serious, dark spots were faintly visible. Xu, the police chief, considered that the case involved a foreigner injuring a Chinese woman and fleeing in fear of punishment, and immediately prepared a document to report to Director Yuan to make a serious representation to the consul of the country and to bear the medical expenses.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau Refutes the Declaration of the Pudong Butchers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau issued a refutation of the declaration of the butchers in the three areas of Lan Ni Du, Yangjia Du, and Lao Bai Du, stating that the declaration of these merchants in the Shenbao Times News on May 12 contains many inaccuracies. The refutation is as follows: (1) The bureau is gradually implementing the slaughter inspection rules of the city for the purchase of meat by citizens to prevent the harm of meat products with infectious diseases. The bureau has always been mindful of the business situation of the butchers, but it cannot but consider the health of the majority of citizens. For example, the prohibition of meat products with infectious diseases may cause losses to the costs of a small number of butchers, but it must be done for the sake of the majority of citizens. Similarly, centralized slaughter inspection may cause inconvenience to a small number of butchers, but it is done to facilitate inspection and avoid deception of the majority of citizens. Therefore, it has been reported to the municipal government for approval that before the establishment of the municipal slaughterhouse, the bureau will inspect suitable locations in each district for the butchers to jointly establish a public slaughterhouse for centralized slaughter inspection. (2) The location for the establishment of a public slaughterhouse in the Yangjing District has been designated by the bureau at Xiaozhao Family Residence. This location is the most suitable location in the Yangjing District, and it takes only one or two hours for the most distant butcher shops in the district to reach the centralized slaughter inspection. This should be followed. If all the butchers demand the establishment of separate slaughterhouses for their own convenience, the veterinary personnel will not be sufficient to allocate and the inspection will not be thorough. Unscrupulous butchers will easily get the opportunity to slaughter diseased pigs privately. Moreover, most of the districts have already centralized slaughter inspection, so why should the butchers in these three areas hold different opinions? (3) According to local practice, pigs are slaughtered before sunrise, and then transported from Xiaozhao Family Residence back to Lan Ni Du and other places, at most within an hour. How can they be rotten? There has never been anyone who buys meat in butcher shops before sunrise, so why worry about not being able to meet the market? (4) The bureau has approved the butchers in these areas to choose their own convenience, either to merge the pigs into the public slaughterhouse in Tangqiao District for slaughter or to cross the river to merge into the Xuejiabang slaughterhouse for slaughter, but they still demand to set up their own slaughterhouses, which is improper. (5) In order to prevent the citizens of Pudong from mistakenly eating meat with infectious diseases that is sold privately, the bureau has consistently implemented the policy of slaughter inspection and has adopted a fair treatment in each district. In view of the butchers who are slaughtered together, in addition to submitting a report to the municipal government on the situation, we hereby refute it to avoid confusion. We hope that the butchers in these three areas will understand the overall situation and not try to disrupt the policy of maintaining the health of the majority of citizens because of a little trouble. They should quickly determine where they are willing to merge for centralized slaughter inspection. The responsibility of the bureau is to focus on the public health of the majority of citizens and will never deviate for the convenience of a small number of individuals. Moreover, we have already accommodated and considered their situation, but they are stubbornly unclear and should reflect on themselves. The declaration of a strike is actually useless.</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting of Neighborhood Associations in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The French Concession Tenants' Federation's dispute over new houses in Xing'an Lane, Ximen Road, has become a lawsuit in the French Court, which was opened once on April 30 but has not yet been decided. It is now learned that the tenants are accusing the landlord of unreasonably renovating the houses and cutting off the water supply. The trial is scheduled to open on the 14th of this month. The federation, having received requests for assistance from the Zhen'an Lane Neighborhood Association, convened a joint meeting of representatives of various neighborhood associations yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Representatives from Renji South Lane, Yongxing Lane, Luban Road, Wender Lane, Houfu Lane, Tingyun Lane, Jingyi Lane, Fuxing Lane, Yufu Lane, Jinyu Lane, Sanyi Lane, Yongyu Lane, Sanyu Lane, Sanrang Lane, and others, more than 50 people in total, attended the meeting to discuss and vote on the following: A. At 10:30 AM on the morning of the 14th, when the French Court opens the trial of the tenants' lawsuit against the landlord, representatives from all neighborhood associations will attend to observe the trial. B. In the future, if similar cases of unreasonable oppression occur in the properties of various neighborhood associations, they must support each other and unite to strengthen the power of the tenants. C. The neighborhood associations that have not yet joined the French Federation must join together to consolidate the organization and show unity. If there are any issues to be negotiated, they must first report to the Federation for record so that it can provide guidance. D. According to Shanghai custom, the landlord must have three reasons to order the tenant to leave the house: (1) The landlord is indeed wanting to take back the house for his own use; (2) The tenant has owed rent for more than three months and has not paid the arrears for three months after the court's judgment; (3) The house has been old and dilapidated for a long time and the local competent authority has ordered it to be renovated. If the landlord does not have the above three reasons, the landlord has no right to order the tenant to leave the house. That is, the points stated on the house ticket are unilateral laws and not fixed regulations and cannot be used as a basis for saying that there is a reason. The Federation will notify all tenants of this matter to pay attention to it. E. When necessary, petition the French Consul General to stop the profit-making of subletting and the illegal demand for rent increases for new house renovations, and ask the French Court to handle cases fairly based on the three customary facts. Also, ask the French Public Works Bureau to issue renovation and demolition permits carefully and ask the Director General of the French Concession Police to order all police stations not to support the landlord and carry out demolition. The above methods were all approved and passed. (5) The chairman reported that there was hope of a peaceful solution to the housing dispute in Zhen'an Lane, and negotiations are currently underway, but it could not be announced for the time being. However, all the points discussed in today's meeting are peaceful methods based on the customs, facts, and laws for the tenants. The Federation, being entrusted by all the tenants, will naturally choose the best one to implement. The whole audience applauded and welcomed the decision. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Delegation to Japan Scheduled to Depart</h3>

<h3>Northern Sea Herring Arrived in Wusong Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Northern Sea herring boat named Wang Changxing of the Chaohu gang arrived in Wusong yesterday morning, sold by the Cuisheng Fish Company and others. The boat was loaded with more than 3,000 herring with scales. On-site trading opened at 20 yuan per dan. Because this herring is the best of the Northern Sea herring and tastes quite rich, it sells the most. Hangzhou and Jiaxing in Zhejiang Province have all sent representatives to Wusong to purchase them. Therefore, once the fish was unloaded and weighed for sale, it was sold out in an instant. All 18 salted fish shops in Wusong 本鎭 were only assigned four baskets of herring, with each of the 18 shops equally divided into two catties. Therefore, the entire town sold out in less than 10 hours. Those who received the news later were already out of luck.</p>
<h3>Minor Monetary Quarrel Resulting in Injury</h3>
<p>A case involving a single copper coin. Wang Jinxiang, a 27-year-old resident of Taixing, living at No. 54, Huangdang Alley, Xiaoputuo Bridge, outside Xiaonanmen in the Nantao area, makes a living selling sweets. The other day, Wang and some locals, including Ling Heshang and Mei Chengxiang, who lived nearby at No. 30, Lushixi Street, were playing a game with coins in an alley on that street. A dispute arose over the loss of a single copper coin, leading to a fight between Wang and Ling. They wrestled and exchanged blows. Wang, being weaker, was injured, with blood flowing from his head and around his eyes. Wang immediately took Ling to the local precinct, District One, Section One, to report the incident. After preliminary interrogation, the precinct chief deemed it highly inappropriate to resort to violence over such a trivial matter as a copper coin. Given the nature of the injury, he ordered the suspect and the victim to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for further investigation.</p>
<p>A case involving 4,200 [copper coins]. Wang Hongjun, a 31-year-old from Yixing, worked as a partner in the Fuxiangcun sugar and confectionery shop in Zhuhang Alley, South Shanghai. Previously, Wang had an urgent need and borrowed 5,000 [copper coins] from Xu Aren, a man from Wenzhou whom he knew. He had already repaid some of the money, but still owed 800 [copper coins]. Yesterday, Xu again pressed him for repayment. Wang claimed that he had already returned the money and only owed 800 coins, so he did not understand why Xu was pursuing him so insistently. Xu argued that he had never received any repayment. An argument ensued, which escalated into a physical altercation. Wang was unable to defend himself and suffered a head injury with profuse bleeding. Peng Lide, the guard on duty at Post Thirteen, heard the commotion and arrived to take both men to the local precinct, District One, Section One. After preliminary interrogation, the precinct chief, considering the nature of the injury, ordered both parties to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case Cracked on the Lushan Maru</h3>
<p>Two Boys Rescued</p>
<p>Kidnappers Tang Zhengjin, in collusion with female trafficker Wu Xu, lured two boys from Shandong and Anhui inland and brought them to Shanghai. Yesterday, at approximately 9:00 AM, they arrived at the Nisshin Shipping Company wharf at Laobaidu in Pudong to board the Japanese ship Lushan Maru, intending to export them to Xiamen for sale. Shortly thereafter, Chen Shaoting and Lin Yongfang, two investigators from the Women and Children Relief Association, boarded the ship. Finding their behavior suspicious, they questioned the group, who gave contradictory answers. The investigators immediately arrested them and brought them to the Water Police Station for interrogation. The confessed criminals, Wu Xu, a 39-year-old woman from Anhui, and Tang Zhengjin, a 34-year-old from Huaiyin, admitted to kidnapping the two children for profit. According to the kidnapped boys, one named Chen Xiaobang (also known as Xiaozhu), six years old, from Huaiyang County, Anhui, lived in Yangjiaji, Yanghuizi, in that county. Both his parents were alive, his father, Chen Hairen, was a small vendor, and he had an older sister and a younger sister. He had been kidnapped and brought to Shanghai nearly a month ago. The other boy, Chen Xiaolong, was eight years old from Shandong, and his family circumstances were unknown. Based on the confessions, the police chief ordered the male and female criminals to be sent to the District Court for trial, and the two children were sent to the court to be helped to return to their hometowns and reunite with their families.</p>
<h3>Invited Out, then Pulled Into a Small Inn</h3>
<p>Man Already Waiting, Lin Bao Escapes Upon Realizing</p>
<p>Wang Linbao, a sixteen-year-old local girl from Lujiadu in Pudong, is unmarried and works at the Yingchang Match Factory there. Zhang Xiaomei, a twenty-four-year-old local female co-worker who is quite beautiful, lives not far from Linbao, and the two are quite close. Recently, Xiaomei had been inviting Linbao to various entertainment venues in Shanghai. Linbao, unable to refuse, agreed to meet Xiaomei at the end of the workday the other day to go to the Great World. The two hired a boat to cross the river to Puxi. Unexpectedly, Xiaomei suddenly pulled Linbao into an inn in the French Concession. Linbao saw a man waiting and, realizing something was amiss, immediately fled back home to tell her mother, Wang Huang. That evening, she took Xiaomei to the 3rd District Public Security Bureau to report the incident, stating the situation and claiming that her daughter was fortunate to have escaped and preserved her innocence, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable. She requested that Zhang Xiaomei be severely punished for enticing a virgin into such a scheme. Zhang Xiaomei, when questioned, denied having done any of those things. The district chief reviewed the statements and ordered an investigation to clarify the facts.</p>

<h3>The Cruelty of Abusing an Adopted Daughter</h3>
<p>Body Covered in Wounds, Skin Broken and Bleeding</p>
<p>Chen Sun, a forty-seven-year-old from Yancheng, lives in a bungalow in Hefengli, Robison Road, in West Shanghai. She has a daughter named Xiaosanzi, who is twelve years old, and whom she cherishes very much. As living costs have risen in recent years, and life is difficult, Chen, through a matchmaker last year, betrothed Xiaosanzi to Yao Qifu, a fellow townsman living at No. 24, Gongyili, Yangshupu, to be his adopted daughter-in-law. After both parties agreed, Yao immediately took the girl into his home. However, Yao is inherently violent and beats the girl severely for the slightest offense. Neighbors have complained about Yao's abuse of his adopted daughter. Because she could not bear the suffering, the girl tried to run back home. The last time she returned home after being beaten. Although her mother felt pity for her, she had already promised her to another, so she could only temporarily endure it and planned to send her back to Yao after a few days and negotiate with him. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Yao rushed to Chen's house in a rage and forcibly dragged his adopted daughter away. Because the girl did not want to go with him, Yao became angry and beat her to the ground with a cane. Although her mother tried her best to stop him, she was unable to do so, and the girl was left with wounds all over her body, her skin broken and bleeding. Chen then called the police, who arrested both Yao and the girl and took them to the 6th District Police Station for questioning.</p>
<h3>An Unscrupulous Woman</h3>
<p>Flees While Husband is Seriously Ill, Landlord Shows Great Integrity</p>
<p>No. 9, Alley 3, Guangyili, Baoshan Road, Zhabei, is a building rented by Jiang Azeng. It has been divided into more than ten rooms, resembling pigeon coops, inhabited by poor people. Zhu Atong, a Ningbo native, lives in the fifth-floor loft. Recently, he was hospitalized with a leg ulcer. His wife, Zhu Yu, is a woman of marrying age who refuses to live a life of poverty. Xu Xu, from Changshu, who lives in the kitchen annex in the back, is a procuress. She incited Zhu Yu to run away, promising to take her to a better place. Zhu Yu agreed, and after her husband was hospitalized, she planned her escape. Xu Xu also consulted with Zhang Genming and Zhang Jin, a nearby couple, to earn some money from the situation. The Zhangs readily agreed to go to Changshu and make arrangements. Thus, Xu Xu gave notice to Jiang Azeng to vacate the premises, and at the same time, the Zhangs also terminated their lease with their landlord. On the day the two families moved out, Zhu Yu also disappeared. Jiang, feeling a sense of responsibility as Zhu Atong's long-term tenant, knowing that the sick man in the hospital would not know that his family was ruined, suspected Xu Xu's involvement. Knowing that they would not be able to escape that day, he waited in the North Railway Station yesterday morning. As expected, he saw Xu Xu, Zhang Genming, Zhang Jin, and Zhu Yu arriving at the station. He immediately seized them and called the road police, who took them to the Railway Police Station. Zhu Yu claimed that she was voluntarily going to Changshu with Xu Xu and that Jiang had no right to interfere with her freedom. However, the authorities, seeing that she had left her husband, who was seriously ill, to travel far away, deemed her to be an unscrupulous woman and transferred the group to the District Court for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Cantonese Grain Merchants Refuse to Load British Ships</h3>
<p>Due to Shortages, Outrage Erupts, Alliance Resolves to Stop Loading Jardine Ships</p>
<p>The British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. had a case involving the heavy fine on the Hakka for water theft in the North last year, which aroused opposition from the Tianjin gangs. They formed an alliance that refused to load the company's ships for more than half a year, until the matter was resolved recently. Unexpectedly, just as one issue subsided, another arose. Recently, a large quantity of miscellaneous grains such as flour, beans, and raw kernels were shipped to Guangdong by Jardine's ships. However, shortages have occurred every time the cargo was unloaded. According to the rules, the shipping company is fully responsible and compensates for the loss. However, Jardine Matheson refused to pay the Hakka's shortage compensation. The Shanghai Cantonese Grain Merchant Guild held several general meetings to address the matter. They believed that the company disregarded the interests of Chinese merchants and violated shipping regulations. Therefore, they decided that all Cantonese grain merchants would refuse to load Jardine's ships from yesterday onward, and all merchants signed a document to sever shipping relations with the company immediately.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Diplomatic Files to be Shipped to Beijing</h3>
<p>Including Gao Ying's Belongings</p>
<p>Chen Shiguang, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, previously received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the various completed, pending, and new files transferred from the former Jiangsu and Zhejiang Special Commissioners for Foreign Affairs offices, which were under the office's custody after the offices were abolished, were to be processed and checked by the Ministry and needed to be shipped to Beijing in boxes. Director Chen instructed the file manager, Cheng Dahuan, to create a registration and prepare fourteen wooden boxes. The packing was completed, and the railway bureau has been contacted to prepare cars to be transported on the 14th of this month. Cheng Dahuan will accompany the cars to the Ministry. It has been said that the files contain items related to Gao Ying, the former vice consul in San Francisco, and his wife, which were transferred from the Jiangsu Special Commissioner for Foreign Affairs office. Gao and his wife were handed over from America when their opium smuggling crimes were exposed. In Gao's luggage there were two pistols and two hundred fifty bullets. The Ministry's order to hand those items over to Gao's family was not followed when Gao's relation Gao Changzhen requested that it be held for Gao himself to come pick them up upon his release. So the items are still there. Now Director Chen wishes to ship the file along with the guns to the Ministry and has also provided a separate letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the acceptance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fast Ship Chichibu Maru Arrives in China</h3>

<h3>Gandhi Case Affects Shipping</h3>
<p>India's silk trade greatly reduced. After Gandhi's arrest, disturbances have occurred in various parts of India, and Shanghai's commercial prospects have been greatly affected. Exports to India have already decreased within the past week, and Chinese silk exports have been particularly hard hit. Today, the ship Nagapona, bound for Mumbai, carried only twelve pieces of Chinese silk from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Indian Sailors Say:</p>
<p>Most of the sailors on the British companies' European, Central Asian, and Indian liners in Shanghai are Indians. Lately, after hearing about the Gandhi case, the Indian sailors on ships such as the Maitou and Nagapona have been holding prayer ceremonies on board and expressing other sentiments. The shipping companies have ordered the captains to closely monitor and prevent any strikes from happening, which could obstruct the voyages.</p>
<h3>The Bank of China's Eighteenth Annual Report</h3>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>(5) The Bank of China's business in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China (1929): The business comparison between the sixth and seventeenth years of the Republic of China has been described above. Now, the business of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China is described in order to compare it with the seventeenth year to see the general situation of business progress. The fixed deposits in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China increased by more than 2,870,000 yuan, and the current deposits increased by more than 47,520,000 yuan. Currently, the total of fixed deposits and current deposits is 438,090,000 yuan, which is three times more than the sixth year of the Republic of China. The total amount of banknotes issued was more than 197,700,000 yuan, an increase of more than 25,400,000 yuan. Fixed-term loans increased by more than 2,690,000 yuan, and current loans increased by more than 48,230,000 yuan. The increase in marketable securities was not significant, only more than 600,000 yuan. Operating real estate and other expenses increased by more than 1,400,000 yuan for the construction of warehouses and houses in various branches. The amortization of banknote manufacturing costs was more than 660,000 yuan, leaving more than 1,635,000 yuan. This amount is listed under the asset item, which is not appropriate and is planned to be fully amortized within one or two years. A portion of the fixed-term loans and current loans are owed by the central and local government agencies. The current government has established a National Domestic and Foreign Debt Consolidation Committee to study and consolidate the method. It is hoped that this method will be implemented as soon as possible. Not only can the bank's assets be more certain, but the government's credit can also be maintained. Of the 197,728,286 yuan and 98 cents of banknotes, the Shanghai branch, as of December of the eighteenth year, according to the report of the inspection committee, had a total issue amount of 131,348,281 yuan and 40 cents, of which 60% was cash reserve, 40% was guarantee reserve, and other branches, although the same mechanism had not been established for inspection, maintained a reserve rate of 60%. Therefore, the debt category of banknotes issued at 197,720,000 yuan, and the cash item under the asset category of reserve, actually accounted for more than 118,600,000 yuan in cash. As for the net profit of the eighteenth year, it was 1,962,414 yuan, 21 cents, of which 10% was set aside as public reserve of 196,241 yuan and 42 cents. The remaining net profit of 1,766,172 yuan and 79 cents was used to distribute a 7% interest to official shares and commercial shares, totaling 1,729,714 yuan. The remaining 36,458 yuan and 77 cents was added to the accumulated item. From this point of view, the business performance of the eighteenth year was able to improve slightly compared to the seventeenth year due to the relatively stable situation and the gradual consolidation of the bank's foundation to achieve considerable progress. Since the National Government promulgated the new regulations of the Bank of China on October 26 of the seventeenth year, it gave the Bank of China a certain status while maintaining the spirit of the old regulations for the bank's independent operation. In addition, if the government entrusts the bank with the management of the 1895 Russian-French foreign debt, the 1896 British-German foreign loan, the 1898 British-German Jiji loan, and one-quarter of the Russian portion and all of the German portion of the 1913 Reconstruction Loan, all of this is enough to show the spirit of public-private cooperation and implement the powers and responsibilities entrusted to it. Not only does it allow the bank to increase its overseas credit and gradually develop overseas to support China's overseas trade, but it also allows the bank to focus on assisting industrial and commercial sectors to build the foundation for foreign trade. This is worth reporting to the shareholders. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Chen Zhaorong, a Family Member of the May 30th Incident Victims,</h3>
<p>Requests to Move Chen Zhaochang's Remains to the Public Cemetery</p>
<p>Chen Zhaorong, the brother of Chen Zhaochang, a martyr of the May 30th Massacre from Xinhui, Guangdong, saw an advertisement in the newspaper last year about the May 30th Massacre Victims' Families Association gathering for registration. He went to the association to register on April 12th and then returned to his hometown. On March 12th of this year, he received 2,000 yuan in compensation from the association. As Chen's coffin is still kept in the Guangdong Guild Hall, he wrote to the Victims' Families Association requesting them to forward a letter to the board of directors of the public cemetery to allow Chen's remains to be moved to the public cemetery. The original letter reads: "Respectfully, my late brother Chen Zhaochang died on Nanjing Road on May 30th of the 14th year of the Republic of China. It has been five years since his death. The compensation has been allocated by your association, and I have received the full amount of 2,000 yuan in silver notes from the Holland Bank. However, my late brother's coffin is still kept in the Guangdong Guild Hall and has not been buried. How can his spirit be comforted in the underworld? I plan to bury him in the May 30th Public Cemetery. Therefore, I am writing to request your association to forward a letter to the board of directors of the May 30th Public Cemetery so that my late brother's remains can be moved to the public cemetery to comfort his loyal spirit and keep his eternal rest. I respectfully request your approval and implementation. Both the living and the dead will be grateful. Sincerely, Chen Zhaorong, Family Member of the May 30th Massacre Victims, Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Sudden Death of an Old Man Approved for Exemption from Autopsy</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, a gray-haired old man suddenly collapsed and died on Wuzhen Road, Xinmin Road, Zhabei. A police officer from the Wuzhen Road police station of the Fourth District saw this and reported it to the headquarters. The headquarters ordered the local security officer to report for verification. However, at 2:00 PM, a young man named Gu A'gen came to the station and claimed that the deceased was his father, Gu Caichang, 51 years old, from Suzhou, who lived on Rue du Pere Froc in the French Concession. He had been suffering from an old illness and had been staying at the Mingli Hotel. Because his illness had worsened, he was evicted and suddenly died on the road. He requested an exemption from autopsy. After sending the police to investigate, the facts were confirmed and the family members were allowed to prepare the coffin for burial.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Screening of a Dutch Rayon Film</h3>
<p>Last night, the Dutch Algemeene Kunstzijde Unie N.V. (comprising the Enka plant in Arnhem, Holland, and the Glanzstoff plant in Eberfeld, Germany) held a screening at the Chinese YMCA on Szechuan Road of a film produced by their factory demonstrating the manufacturing process of rayon. Mr. S.W.A. Swarz, a special representative from the factory, lectured on the contents of the film. He stated that this film is unique in the world, as other factories do not have such films, fearing that their contents would be seen and copied by others. However, the Algemeene Kunstzijde Unie N.V. has broken away from this entrenched idea. The excellent manufacturing of Enka Glanzstoff rayon is entirely due to the perfection of the manufacturing process, and the advantages of this process cannot be fully revealed in a film. The film begins with scenes of the raw materials for rayon production being sourced from Norway, consisting of paper made from wood. This paper is transported to the Enka factory, where it undergoes chemical processing, spinning, bleaching, drying, and other procedures to become rayon. After production, female workers carefully select and classify the rayon before it is transported for export. The film's depiction of the factory's machinery is very clear. Most remarkably, the Dutch factory can produce rayon that, if stretched out, would reach from the Earth to the Moon in just three hours. According to Mr. Swarz's report, the production of rayon in 1930 is expected to exceed 300 million pounds, and China's demand is also steadily increasing. This film is one of the most valuable new industrial films recently shown in Shanghai, and the audience was invariably satisfied. It is said that another screening will be held within the month, inviting people from all walks of life to attend.</p>

<h3>A Bloody Heart as a Gift to a Dancer</h3>
<p>Agence Telegraphique, Angora, 10th: A famous Italian dancer, Miss Landa, received a heart, still dripping with blood, in a beautiful box decorated with flowers. The gift was signed only as "A young man whom nobody knows, dying for his love for you." A small golden hairpin inlaid with diamonds was stuck on the heart. Miss Landa received the gift on stage at the Angora Theater as she was finishing her performance. Initially, she thought it was candy, then a toy. When she opened it and saw it was a heart, she and the other dancers fled backstage. The commotion in the theater was even greater than during the performance. After searching everywhere, the giver could not be found. The police sent the heart to a hospital for identification and discovered that it was a horse's heart. This can truly be called a prank.</p>
<h3>The Era of Talking Cars</h3>
<p>Paris dispatch: The sound of car horns is unpleasant, and it only serves as a warning without any other function. In this fast-paced era, this is not sufficient. Recently, an amplifier for car horns has appeared in Paris. It is similar to a wireless telephone and is installed next to the driver's steering wheel. The driver can speak softly into the amplifier, saying things like "Please step back," "Turn left or right," or "Please pull over and wait." The amplifier can amplify the voice dozens of times, reaching people on the street. This is not just for warnings, but also for attracting customers, such as saying "Cheap fare, please come in." Recently, the amplified voices of these drivers have been frequently heard on the streets of Paris.</p>
<h3>Temple Festival of the Balinese by Mao Yuewen</h3>
<p>Bali is the closest small island of the Lesser Sunda Islands to Java. The most distinct difference between the people of this island and the natives of other islands in Southeast Asia is their tolerant attitude towards religion. When Brahmanism spread to Java, temples were also established on this island. When Islam replaced Brahmanism, the Balinese welcomed it as well. Finally, Christianity, accompanied by the power of the white people, invaded the island and existed without obstacles. Does this mean that the Balinese believe in any religion? Not at all. The Balinese have their own inherent customs and beliefs, and no religion can shake their faith. What is commendable is that they absolutely do not have the same hostility towards other religions as other ethnic groups. They often place various religions next to their own altars and worship them. Such great tolerance is unparalleled by any other ethnic group.</p>
<p>The Balinese believe that everything in Bali is ruled by gods. The gods are the source of all human affairs and happiness, the masters of all blessings, and the source of all power. Under the power of the gods, every place is dedicated to them, and all work is done for them. Therefore, every mountain and hill, every beach and tide, every forest, even every tree, village, palace, house, garden, and cemetery has a temple. The temples are open to everyone. The roof of the temple is the vast, bright sky. Beneath the sky, the trees bloom with flowers year-round, and the breeze sighs gently. This beautiful and peaceful tropical land softly shrouds the culturally backward Balinese people in a mysterious and harmonious net.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about the Balinese temple festivals. This is a magnificent divine gathering. Its kindness, solemnity, and beauty often surprise and amaze outsiders because no outsider expects to encounter such a magnificent and loving divine gathering here.</p>
<p>When the Balinese hold temple festivals, all the temples are, without saying, decorated very luxuriously. The unique sounds of bronze drums here are struck together vigorously. At this time, on the roads under the green shade, one can see women wearing silk outer garments and gold jewelry, walking barefoot in groups to the temples. Each of them carries a tray on her head, filled with flowers and fruits, elaborately arranged. From a distance, this group of people looks like the celestial maidens described in Arabian stories, more beautiful than one can imagine. These offerings, when piled up, are often seven feet high and so heavy that it takes three people to lift them. However, when they are carried on the bronze heads of the women, they seem weightless as they walk with kindness and solemnity. All the offerings are piled on a bamboo frame, with the most numerous being the various kinds of gorgeous rice cakes, adorned with various fragrant flowers. The rich atmosphere reveals the joy and reverence that wells up from the bottom of the Balinese people's hearts.</p>
<p>Balinese temples usually have only three courtyards. The first courtyard is open and contains the temple gate. The second courtyard is filled with long benches for gatherings. The third courtyard is the place for prayer, and the altar is built there. As soon as the women enter the first gate, they take down the offerings and place them on the bamboo frame. After the offerings are arranged, they walk into the altar. At that time, the pillars in the altar are decorated with fresh flowers and leaves, creating a magnificent and fragrant atmosphere. The white-robed priests take the special offerings for the altar from their hands and place them around the altar. The sound of the bronze drums stops, and they all kneel down to pray. At this time, the sky is turning dark, and their brown backs are reflected in the faint twilight, truly a matchless and beautiful scene.</p>
<p>As they pray, they softly sing hymns of praise. A white-robed monk holds a long-necked golden bottle and kindly walks in front of them to distribute holy water. They receive a small drop and use it to wash their foreheads, lips, and hands. Then, they bow their heads and extend their hands to take a holy flower. The good children beside them watch attentively and imitate them. Everyone imitates them quietly and reverently. This lovely and agile scene is so moving that it brings tears of gratitude. After them come the men, who all have bare heads and perform the same rituals. Next are the aristocratic women, with flowers in their hair and carrying offerings in their hands, holding them at shoulder height. Finally, there is the village chief and his subordinates, receiving holy water from the monks. This concludes the first part of the temple festival.</p>
<p>The monks return to the temple, arrange the many offerings on the altar, and pray, asking the gods to descend and enjoy the people's respect. After the offerings have been presented, the women take them back home to eat. When all the offerings in the village have been eaten, the bronze drums sound again, and everyone gathers in the temple in response. At this time, the first and second courtyards of the temple are lit with bright lights and torches. If the village has suffered misfortune, such as a plague that has killed many people, the villagers must decide on this night to beg the gods for help. That is when the kind and peaceful scene will transform into another frightening scene. In the temple courtyard, they place a hateful and terrifying statue of the god of death, with a large body, wearing white clothes, a large head covered with thick, long hair, deep and dark eye sockets, and gleaming fangs protruding from its mouth, with a long tongue drooping to the ground, as if licking blood. They slowly move this god of death, making it look at the sick people around it to appease its insatiable appetite. Naked children, with their hair disheveled, drink strong liquor and dance wildly around it. Each child holds a snake-shaped dagger in his right hand. One of them suddenly stabs the dagger into his chest. Under the firelight, blood flows like a river. The other children wrap his wound, sing heroic songs, and help the little hero, who sacrificed himself for the masses, away.</p>
<p>Then, a second child approaches the god of death, offering himself as a sacrifice, performing the same ritual. At this time, the entire temple is filled with intense, urgent, and foolish hope. Finally, enough blood has been shed, and the dark god of death no longer moves. Its hands hang down weakly. The blind enthusiasm of the villagers has been appeased. Then, it slowly subsides. The sound of the bronze drums rings softly, playing a mournful and sad tune. In the dim light, an old woman walks out, wearing simple clothing, slowly dancing with solemn steps. The music stops, and in the silence, the old woman begins to sing. Her voice is gentle, and her tune is full of sorrow and misery. Everyone is slightly affected, and some are already crying. The monks kneel in front of the altar and recite prayers loudly. Only then do the villagers quietly disperse from the dark night into the various roads.</p>

<p>The Spring Scenery Is Not As Good As Last Year, Written in Wubu:</p>
<p>A gentle and warm breeze blows, telling me that spring has returned to the world. I vaguely recall this day last year, when I was stranded in Yancheng, living in a county middle school. I had nothing to do during the day, and by evening, I was bored and restless. I would always leave the school alone and run westward, along the desolate riverbank, gazing at the sunset and chasing the fishing boats. The sunset glow shone on the fishing boats, and the afterglow reflected in the heart of the river. I stared intently, often losing my footing and falling into the water. I walked like this, aimlessly, until I could no longer distinguish my fingers, then I would follow the same path back. Graves were scattered across the fields, but I didn't feel any fear. Sometimes, I would run wildly in and out of the city. I especially liked to walk back and forth on Dengying Bridge, which I heard was built by Mr. Shen Dengying at the end of the Ming Dynasty and had some history. The particularly high bridge and its strange style were rare even in the interior. I walked up step by step, my long clothes fluttering in the wind, feeling like I was walking in a fairyland. Running to the highest point of the bridge, I would stand there for a long time, lost in reverie, gazing at the white clouds in the sky, not illuminated by the moon, contemplating my life and shedding tears.</p>
<p>I often went to visit a Mr. Zhou. His lively and amiable wife always played chess and sang with us. Every time I wanted to leave, she would always say, "It's still early, it's still early," and insist on my staying. Sometimes I would sneak out the door, and she would quickly pull me back. We would chat and laugh until late at night, when she would send a maid with a lantern to see me back. I watched the light under her feet, walking silently step by step. All around, there was nothing to be seen except for the noisy croaking of frogs and the sparse barking of dogs. Sometimes, when I returned earlier, I could hear the night singers from afar, across the river, singing sadly to the accompaniment of a huqin. She always saw me to the door before taking the lamp back. I pushed open the school gate and ran to the last courtyard. I heard that this used to be a guild hall and that ghosts often appeared. I myself had encountered one once. I didn't care. I walked into my room, lit the oil lamp, and went to sleep in a daze, sleeping until dawn...</p>
<p>A gentle and warm breeze blows, telling me that spring has returned to the world, and my body feels lively and light. I am fortunate to be able to study here in peace this year. But those past events, those events that are only a year away, how can they not make me remember? Alas, how many precious springs does life have? We are getting older day by day. Our precious youth, our youth that is gone forever, how should we strive? Strive, strive, strive! How can we linger any longer?</p>

<p>Women's Life</p>
<h3>Floating Memories, Peng Lupi</h3>
<p>This happened a year ago, when my younger sister and I were staying with our classmate Sister Huilan in California.</p>
<p>It was a summer evening. The goddess of night had just unfurled her quiet curtain, and a round, silvery jade plate rose above the eastern clouds. The dark blue, serene sky canopy was dyed around her, making her appear even more crystal clear, luminous, and quietly graceful. Sparkling stars followed her edge, seemingly further highlighting her beautiful, unparalleled, and ostentatious demeanor. A gust of sea breeze blew from the west, giving people a special sense of coolness and pleasure.</p>
<p>After dinner, my younger sister, Sister Huilan, and I took a small boat on the nearby NC Lake in this beautiful moonlit night. The clear moonlight shone on the gently rippling lake water, shimmering like countless scattered silver scales. The soft sound of the oars echoed, like the low cries of geese in the deep midnight.</p>
<p>Sister Hui slowly raised her mandolin and played Ramona, which was popular at the time. My younger sister opened her clear throat and harmonized with her melodious and moving sound waves. In that quiet and silent air, it was truly serene and otherworldly.</p>
<p>When the boat reached the center of the lake, I stopped rowing and allowed the boat to float on its own. At this time, the surface of the water, with its slightly rippling and sparkling scales, gradually calmed down, and the starlight and moonlight repeatedly appeared on the mirror-like surface of the water.</p>
<p>Sister Huilan and my younger sister also put down their instruments and songs. We arbitrarily talked about interesting stories and strange myths in the extremely quiet and serene air, but sometimes we would all stare blankly at the serene sky, looking at the hazy Milky Way, the sparkling stars, and the charming moon. Sometimes we would all bend down and look at our blurry reflections, scooping up the crystal clear lake water. At that time, our hearts were truly like the clear sky after rain, unblemished by any dust.</p>
<p>After a moment, we resumed rowing, gently paddling back and forth. Unknowingly, we had reached the depths of the reeds. Suddenly, a pair of young American women also passed us in a small boat. They also sang clear songs in loud and harmonious voices, the lingering sound lingering among the reeds. Suddenly, one or two night birds fluttered up from among them, causing my younger sister to lie frightened in my arms, and the boat swayed as a result. But afterwards, we only felt the night was quiet, the sky was clear, and all sounds were silent. At that time, our situation was truly like leaving the turbid and chaotic society and entering another clear, quiet world.</p>
<p>Rowing again, chatting again, singing again, until the night was late and the church bells rang out in intermittent fragments. Then, we abandoned our pleasure and returned.</p>
<p>Since that night trip, I returned home with my younger sister within a few days. Afterwards, I always wanted to go back to that place to play, but due to various reasons, I was unable to fulfill my wish. Now, there is even less of a chance. I have already come to the motherland across the vast ocean. Alas, when will I have the opportunity to relive the old days with that beautiful, quiet NC Lake that I cannot forget?</p>
<h3>The Li Women of Qiongzhou, Chen Xianrong</h3>
<p>Qiongzhou, commonly called Hainan Island, has thirteen counties under its jurisdiction and an area of ​​approximately over a thousand miles. Surrounded by the sea on all sides, the entire land is an island, which seems very small. However, since the Qing government ceded Taiwan to Japan after the Sino-Japanese War, it is considered the largest and only island in southern China. Because it is far away from the eighteen provinces connected in blocks and isolated in the South China Sea, transportation is not very convenient. Therefore, when people talk about Qiongzhou, they often associate it with inconvenient transportation. This biased concept was not only the case in ancient times but is still firmly rooted today. Li Deyu of the Tang Dynasty had a poem that said, "Once you go, you are ten thousand miles away, and it is difficult to return. Where is Yazhou? You have to pass through the gate of hell." It can be seen that people at that time all regarded Qiongzhou as a daunting place. Now, its transportation is more convenient than before, but there are still very few people who have been to Qiongzhou. Therefore, everything about Qiongzhou is little known to outsiders, especially the life of its Li women. Speaking of the life of Li women in Qiongzhou, it is really pitiful. They live in dilapidated and tattered small sheds made of scorched leaves and straw. Inside the sheds, big-headed flies make unbearable noises. Their lovely children are mostly naked, without a thread of clothing, with bloated bellies, crawling around in the sunlight as if looking for insects or green grass. What they eat is mountain sticky rice, which is both poor in quality and unknown in spring. It is extremely coarse except for a small amount of rice supplemented with red or white sweet potatoes cooked into porridge. They also don't eat much beef or wild game. In addition, they have a habit of chewing betel nuts. They can be seen chewing these things at any time and anywhere, with saliva drooling down their chests. Because they are used to eating betel nuts, their teeth are as black as ink. It is said that they regard black teeth as beautiful. If there is someone among them with white teeth, everyone will abandon her and say that she is a bad person and even think she is a prostitute. It was previously heard that a Li woman was expelled by her husband because she was not used to eating betel nuts. The severity of their customs is such. As for what they wear, most of them are old blue linen clothes bought from the Han people. They make their own clothes from kapok cloth and coarse linen short trousers. It is said that according to their custom, the upper garment can be bought from the Han people, but the lower garment must be made from their own planted cotton and woven. Otherwise, they will definitely be scolded by everyone.</p>
<h3>All-Japan Women's Organizations Hold a General Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing Three Proposals and Resolving Five Items Regarding the Demand for the Right to Participate in Politics, etc.</p>
<p>Tokyo News: The All-Japan Women's Suffrage League, seizing the opportunity of the constitutional government and political friendship parties competing to propose and include on the agenda the Women's Civil Rights Bill, which is a prerequisite for women's suffrage, held its first All-Japan Women's Convention. Approximately 600 women from various women's organizations across the country, including the Japan Women's Suffrage Association, the Proletarian Women's League, the National Federation of Elementary School Female Teachers, the Buddhist Women's Youth Association, the Christian Women's Youth Association, and the National Western Women's Federation, participated. The meeting was held at the Japan Youth Hall at the end of last month. Ms. Kubushirotomi was elected as chairman, and Ms. Ichikawa Fusako as vice-chairman. Three proposals were discussed: (1) Methods to promote women's suffrage; (2) Methods to popularize political education; (3) Actions after obtaining suffrage. The following five items were resolved to be divided by the implementing committee and submitted to the parliament and other ministries. (1) The All-Japan Women's Convention demands that all Japanese women be granted women's civil rights, women's suffrage, and women's right of association in one fell swoop (for the parliament).</p>
<p>(2) This convention regrets the insufficient political education of the people, especially women, and therefore resolves to thoroughly decide on the following matters: (A) The upper grades of elementary schools must explain current political affairs and strive to cultivate proper political thought guidance when explaining political thought; (B) Request that women's secondary schools make civics a required subject from the freshman year; (C) Hope that the Ministry of Education generalizes adult education lectures, especially establishing women's suffrage lectures at this time (for the Ministry of Education).</p>
<p>(3) Hold the All-Japan Women's Suffrage Conference once a year (for this conference).</p>
<h3>International Women's Conference to Be Held</h3>
<p>Vienna News: The International Women's Conference is held every five years. This year is the conference period, scheduled to be convened in Vienna from the 27th of this month to the 9th of June. Prior to this, a youth conference will be held at Hofburg on the 20th of this month.

The proposed training guidelines are: Traveling to study foreign affairs, international athletic competitions, communicating and exchanging letters, drawings, and handicrafts between primary schools in various countries, and striving to achieve the closest possible contact between young people in various countries. One of the procedures of the International Women's Conference itself is to travel, which is divided into eight types: (1) Research travel for improving varieties; (2) Study tours; (3) Film research travel; (4) Rural women's research travel; (5) Research travel on the causes and symptoms of national characteristics; (6) Public health research travel; (7) Travel for leading the great transformation; (8) Club women's travel. The women's conferences of each country listed in each trip act as hosts to treat the members of the travel group.</p>

<h3>Stories of World Literature (1) (5) (1) Written by American John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</h3>
<p>Chapter 38: French Poetry of the Nineteenth Century</p>
<p>No poet had the vigorousness of Hugo like Alfred de Musset. He had a deep, sorrowful tone, which, if not for his wit, that seasoning salt, might have become sickly and delicate. His strength lay in his critical acumen, which not only governed his willful nature but also enabled him to see the futility of the conflict between classical and Romantic drama. He combined these two types of drama in his theatrical works, especially "Marianne's Caprices." In French theater, "Marianne's Caprices" still lives, and "What Do Young Girls Dream Of," "One Doesn't Trifle with Love," and "Proverb Plays" are part of the established repertoire. Musset admired Byron but imitated the rude, willful, and spontaneous nature of his creation, also with some of his emotional lyric poetry, which was formed with the artistic skill of classical French poetry. In the beautiful "Letter to Lamartine," he summarized his own and the spirit of the age, its sorrow and hope. The following poem, "Sorrow," allows one to glimpse Musset's sorrowful tone.</p>
<p>Power and life have vanished.</p>
<p>Friends, there is no joy.</p>
<p>The faith that once nourished the fragile star that revered me</p>
<p>This pride is now gone.</p>
<p>Formerly I greeted Truth as a friend</p>
<p>At that time I did not yet know her fickle demeanor</p>
<p>When the misty haze falls from our eyes</p>
<p>Ah, the bitter Truth!</p>
<p>The power of Truth is everlasting.</p>
<p>People pass by unheeding,</p>
<p>Spending their short time in emptiness.</p>
<p>Those who hear God speak</p>
<p>Must answer with life given to me</p>
<p>The good thing is</p>
<p>Tears that lighten my heart</p>
<p>At this time, three poets should be even more famous if they were not surrounded by great figures: Brizeux, Barbier, and Gérard de Nerval. Brizeux, being Breton, used his hometown as his material. Thus, his poetry is the poetry of the honest human soil. He also translated Dante's "Divine Comedy" entirely into terza rima. Barbier, a disciple within the society, attacked the evils of the time with vigorous satirical poetry. Nerval was a delicate lyric poet. He maintained the elegance of the previous century but also opposed Romantic coloration. His translation of "Faust" introduced Goethe to France. His prose stories, especially Les Filles du Feu, which contains his masterpiece Sylvie, are excellent works.</p>
<p>On the troubled sea of Romanticism, Théophile Gautier sailed skillfully in a small boat, its white sails shining among the large ships, proceeding along a clear course. His poetry, "Enamels and Cameos," has a completeness that is astonishing even in French poetry. Gautier's stone has a French-style facet, just as a jewel should be, suggesting something that cannot be transported beyond the realm of language. His theory and practice of poetry are "Art," which, in the original, is a pleasure for the French ear, a gospel for French poets. The following are several sections translated by Saint-Beuve:</p>
<p>All things return to dust,</p>
<p>Except for things of beauty skillfully constructed.</p>
<p>The life of a bust</p>
<p>Is longer than a fortress.</p>
<p>The heel of the plowman often</p>
<p>Breaks through the ancient earth,</p>
<p>Revealing</p>
<p>Caesar or some god.</p>
<p>The gods are also unable to escape death, alas!</p>
<p>However, what is immortal and stronger than bronze</p>
<p>Is only the supreme song.</p>
<p>Sculpt, engrave, polish,</p>
<p>Until your illusion</p>
<p>Engraves its smile</p>
<p>Upon the stubborn stone.</p>
<p>Gautier's prose is as refined as his poetry. His famous "Mademoiselle de Maupin" and the less famous but equally admirable "Grotesques" romance, "Young France," are flawless in style. Gautier was not a profound thinker, nor probably a great poet, but he was precisely the typical expression of elegance and taste, liberated from the vulgar. In "Art," and probably in the phrase he invented, "Art for art's sake," his ideal was precisely the thought of the Parnassian group, of which he considered himself the highest-ranking member.</p>
<p>The deepest poet in this group was Leconte de Lisle. He despised Romanticism and all the pleasures of life except for devotion to art and objective truth. Like Schopenhauer, he saw the only refuge in a world of unrealizable contemplation, a brave pessimist. He did not love easy death; in fact, he loved death more than life. He wanted to annihilate the entire world, including even God. This Schopenhauerian melancholy soul had a consciousness of beauty that was so beautiful that it troubled him.</p>
