<h3 id="c10">龍井村事件 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>日本今日之外交。已一變其從前武力侵略政策。吾国僧之。日本當局之對華外交。已一變其從前詭譎手段。而欲進於親善。吾亦信之。然而在東三省延邊之日軍警。常有越軌行動。其當局未聞加以制止者何也。</p>
<p>蓋日本雖已改變其武力侵略政策。而對於東省傳統一貫之主張。則至今未變。日本雖欲實行對華親善。而對於東省特殊關係之一念。則至今未能放棄。因是之故。在東省沿路之日駐軍警察。遂亦不變其從前蔑視華人之觀念。而一仍其向來暴横無理之慣例。此延邊日軍警圍署擄警之案之所以屢起也。此次龍井村之交涉。日警旣無端闖入我步哨綫内開槍以挑釁。後又藉題開到大批武裝日警遊行以示威。致使我地方商民。皇駭萬狀。紛電請援。此種舉動。殊足傷中日之感情者也。延吉在東省。關於中韓日之糾紛最多。最足爲引起衝突之導火線。日當局倘仍偏護日警。信日報之反宣傳。而不予以公正適當之處置。則此後交涉正多。兩國關係。將從何改善。吾故謂日政府之有無親善誠意。祗視其應付此問題之熊度可已。</p>

<p>▲葉楚傖報告蘇省政治中三大問題</p>
<p>蘇省黨整會、於十三日上午九時、在該會大禮堂舉行總理紀念週、出席者有蘇省府主席葉楚傖、該會整委祁錫曾黃宇人馬飲冰等曁來賓及全體工作人員百餘人、祁錫曾主席、行禮後、由主席介紹葉楚傖報告蘇省政治中三大問題、繼由祁錫曾報告四全大會及國民會議之重要畢、禮成而退、茲錄葉楚傖報告如下、在前週的報上、看見蔣主席發表告全國同胞書、略謂月前爲我同胞所最感切要而亦國家實際所需求者有五點、（一）爲肅清匪共（二）爲整理財政（三）爲澄清吏治、（四）爲發展經濟、（五）爲厲行地方自治、這一篇文字、雖是蔣同志用個人所發表、但是將來中央所要發表决定和努力的、亦不外乎前述各點、所以這幾點亦可說是本黨的天經地義的主張、而且這幾點並不是要從今後才開始去做、亦不是在今日始有如此主張、實在是已經做了而未曾做好、或者做到了一部分今日蔣主席之所以要重言以申明之、就是因爲過去對此没有完全做好的緣故、亦就是提醒大家要覺悟、因爲以前没有完全做好、而今後仍須繼續努力做去的意思、上述的五點就是本黨今後施政的綱領、我們一方面要求這五點作標準、來檢查過去的弱點、一方面更須根據這五點而爲今後努力刷新政治的指標、現在我想就這五點的範圍來把本省的政治、作一具體的報告、</p>
<p>（一）關於本省匪共之肅清、本省匪共、迭經痛剿、匪勢稍殺、共禍漸滅、今後肅清尙有希望、惟過去對於剿滅匪共、却難免有幾許錯誤、就是没有用人民的力量、去做肅清匪共的工作、降至最近大江南北、始有人民自衛的組織、因爲本省的實力、僅練有保安隊四團、約計六千餘人、（現在可用者祗有兩團、以此六千餘人的兵力、來分配於六十一縣、在實力上旣是力量單薄、在數目上亦是渺乎其小、於是不得不賴國軍以爲助、最近我在中央謁見蔣主席時、蒙已面允將來可以抽調若干師軍隊、來江浙助剿匪共、所以關於將來匪共之肅清、已有辦法和把握、但是要知國軍雖可暫調剿共、而不能視爲永久的實力、因爲國家的軍隊、自有其特殊的使命、地方祗可調用於一時、祗可用以救濟一時之急迫、在國軍協助痛剿以後、猶須本省自己有相當之實力、而本省因財政困難、一時又難於擴充、於是就不得不注意於人民自衛能力的充實、過去政府、往往不能盡力協助人民自衛組織的發展、確是一種很大的錯誤、不過在人民自衛團組織以後、又生出一個問題、就是這種人民自衛的實力、是否能永久成爲人民的實力、是否會不致變成土匪的或爲其他人所利用的實力、這是很要注意的問題、過去本省有許多區的區政、毫無成績、區公所不過一虚設的塲所、區長的能力、旣不足以爲善、又不足以爲惡、今後如以自衛團歸區長管轄、那麽素無能力的區長、一旦與以實力、其結果又將是如何、或許能變成爲歹人作惡的工具、果爾、這種人民自衛的組織、又將變作非人民的力量、固然、這是一種病理的病象、我們不可因爲某種制度會發生某種的病象、就捨棄不行、而成爲因噎廢食的弊病、所以我們更須設法補救這種的缺憾、務期要養成一種人民眞正的實力、以備能澈底消滅共產黨在民間的毒禍、這是本省猶待繼續努力的肅清匪共問題、</p>
<p>（二）關於本省財政之整理、現在江蘇的財政、是比較以前爲好、雖然、仍是感到窘迫、但不致十分的紊亂、因爲本年已有相當的預算、此種預算、雖未必盡善盡合、終比較過去爲有條理、不過省方的情形、雖然如此、而各縣仍是不能依照辦理、今試舉田賦而論、江蘇之田賦收入、年約一千餘萬元、以全省之田畝實數計、每畝只須年納銀一角、今在事實上人民所納十倍於此、相差十分之九、此種相差之數、就是田賦流弊所致、固然我們已知有弊、自當整理、但其中又生出不易解决的問題、今舉一事爲例、最近在某縣已查出一田賦的流弊、此次流弊、還不過是就某一案中而查見的一端、今省府已把該縣一年中的田賦清册、暫加封存、然後進行清查、此案將來固可查明、然因田賦清册封存、而忙漕即無從徵收、忙漕不能徵收、政府的收入、就暫時停止、因此就覺得要澈底整理田賦、必須二個條件、第一非是要有整理財政的廉潔人才、第二就是必須準備的欵以濟整理時期之窮、然後進行整理、方有成效、如果不能具有這兩個條件、那麽整理就無從說起、又况現在政府、天天要以田賦收入爲維持呢、所以我們整理財政、一方要有犧牲的决心、一方又須籌有的欵、否則終不能有辦法、現在省府同人、就感着這種痛苦、這是本省應待繼續努力的整理財政問題、</p>
<p>（三）關於本省吏治之澄清、今日的吏治、確已到了有治法無治人的時候、試以組織人民自衛團爲例、人民因匪共横行、如呈請政府組織自衛團、政府鑒於此事爲然、乃命令准之、後人民因組織自衛團無經費、乃集議呈請舉辦保衛捐、政府鑒於此舉爲必要、乃又明令准之、不意此法一行於是主辦者即假公濟私、趁機漁利、强捐勒索、敲詐苛派、以至流弊百出、民怨沸騰、政府知此法不妥、設法補救、乃明令凡舉辦自衛捐、非經省府核准不可、更須由省派監理員監督之、此種辦法、似已妥善、但監理員若竟朋比爲奸、通同舞弊、那麽豈非爲敲詐者多加一保障之人、所以我覺得雖有澄清吏治之法、若無澄清吏治之人、亦爲徒然、又如各縣局長考成條例、確爲一澄清吏治之最好方法、但在事實上、則又不盡然、如記過罰俸撤職等處分、在比較要好的人、尙可有用、但用之一般狡黠的人、猶難收效、譬如縣長規定記九個小過、即須撤職、狡黠的人、以爲可以記到八個小過、尙不妨事、只須不做到記第九過小過爲止、還有一種更歹的人、以爲九個小個、旣須要撤職、那麽在做到第九次的時候、索性做樁歹事記一大過、預備撤職、如果是這樣、那麽吏法就不可救藥了、所以我覺得歸結的根本辦法、終要能多多養成有氣節的人才方可、我在中央曾對一般同志說、今後的黨、要負起敎育的責任、若黨與敎育分開、那麽、社會的風氣、民族的道德、就無從振作起來、現在的敎育、雖說是黨化敎育、實際還是粉飾、不能稱之謂化、徒有其黨的表面而已、所謂眞正的黨化敎育、必須以黨爲中心、主義爲中心、來充實敎育的内容、所以我主張敎育的組織、可與黨的組織融爲一體、一切敎育的實施、要能以黨和主義爲中心、必須造成黨的敎育、而黨務工作、亦必須負有敎育的使命、然後舊有惡劣的環境、可以改造、新的健全人才、可以造就、</p>

<p>曁南大學體育部主任（一）陳掌諤</p>
<p>作者久居南洋、對於國内體育情形、尙未熟悉、兼以學淺、對於體育實不敢討論、茲應申報編者之請、就簡單提出一個問題、此個問題、就是「中國女子體育」、此個中國女子體育問題、當去年夏令到廣州各處演講的時候、亦有多次提倡、但是未有完善的發表、現在就可和盤說出來罷、大家都知道女子體育、是重要的問題、從前我們對於體育完全不懂完全不講、所以致中國弄到這樣的衰弱、現在好了、你看近年來無論是學校、或是團體、或是家庭、都能注重體育了、但是女界方面、還没有人出來提倡、眞是一種的遺憾、我們知道中國有四萬萬人、男女各半、其中二萬萬是男子、還有二萬萬是女子、男子應該注重體育、女子更要注重、應比男子更格外的注意、因爲今天的女子、就是將來的國母、今天的女子身體不好、將來長成以後、他的身體、必不會强壯的、那麽以後他們所傳下的小國民、亦就跟着衰弱、可見今日的女子、對於我們民族的强弱、是有很大的關係、現在和閱者諸位先討論一個小小的問題、這個是人生必需的東西、諸位想這是什麽東西呢、這是我們一時一刻不能離開的東西、就是空氣、我們在幾分鐘内、若果没有空氣、就不能生活、假使没有水或是没有米糧在七八天或幾十天内、也會死的、若是没有太陽日光或日終日操作、没有片刻的休息、也是不能長久的生存、但是以上各種需要、假使都已有了、那就可以生活了嗎、恐怕還是不能夠啊、譬如現在有一個人、我們天天給他清鮮的空氣和充足的太陽光、又給他充足飲食、并且天天都呌他休息、不要他跑、亦不要他走、整日靜坐不動、試想這人到底會怎麽樣呢、我們敢斷定他不上三四個月、一定會死掉的、大家都能明白這一點、我們就可知道運動是人生很重要的一件事、你看人們初生的時候、呱呱墜地、手舞足蹋、這就是人生第一次的運動、運動這個名辭、亦可稱做體育、現在就是要說體育運動的重要和他的意義、現代敎育家、都承認他（體育）是敎育中重要的科學、是造成完全人格的基礎、閱者諸位應知道體育是各育中的最重要的、體育是造成人格的基礎、什麽呌做人格的基礎呢、譬如我們要建造一座樓屋、這個樓屋的建築、應該有五大要素、第一的要點是壯麗、要能夠使大家贊譽他、一定要壯麗宏敝、所以我們的樓屋、若是壯麗、人家就不約而同的齊聲贊美、第二就是佈置、我們樓屋所以能夠達到壯麗的目的、就是因主持者有美術的學識和細心的研究、第三就是計劃、計劃一節、極爲重要、我們未建樓屋以前、一定要先由工程師討論具體的計劃、才合建築原理、第四就原料、假使我們的樓屋、旣有具體的計劃、佈置整齊、外觀壯麗、但是原料不好、木料是陳舊的、鐵料是生銹的、磚石沙土石都不結實、這樣造成的房子、一定不能持久的、所以原料一項、亦是建築的要素、第五就是基礎、這個問題、是狠重要的、假使這個樓屋的原素是好的、計劃佈置壯麗、都可稱人的意、但基礎不好或是建設在散沙的上面、或在沙坡的上、一旦風起海潮至、豈不是狠危險麽、所以基本堅固、是建築樓屋第一重要問題、我們要培養兒童使他成做一個健全的人、亦和這建築的法子差不多、（未完）</p>

<p>從以上幾點看來、的確、國貨運動的癥結、還是在於生產不發達、而醫治這生產不發達的症候、非得各方共同努力、開誠布公、協謀解决不可、所謂需要各方共同努力的事情、是那幾種呢、我且仿醫生開藥方式的、冩在下面、國貨起死回生方、（一）勞資合作、這是第一味藥、用以驅除兇惡的外邪、病到如此、似已不能不用猛劑　這固然要勞資雙方本身、各自洗心革面、開誠布公的携手起來、纔可製煉成功、但在兩三年積重難返的環境之中、尤其要希望各級黨部和政府多負些責任、從重配置、從濃熬煎、不要目光短淺的只顧勞工一方面　也不要扶得東來西又倒的只顧資主一方面、却要指導雙方明白國貨工廠和工人處境的困難、大家在法律範圍以内辦事、絶不爾虞我詐、纔有回生之望、尤其要緊的　那些爲合作之梗、專惠靠工人運動不勞而獲、自肥囊槖的工賊、應該毫不客氣的加以懲處　（二）減輕捐稅、這味藥是用以培養元氣的、其重要不亞於第一味、其責任全在政府、尤其在執掌賦稅權的財政當局、有句古訓、呌做「竭澤而漁」、照現在這種繁重稅捐、如果不設法切實改革、簡直是要到無魚可漁的地步、這殺鵝取金蛋的辦法、那裡是理財、稅源没有培養、祗知道加稅　民生痛苦　自然日甚、我們尤其要請政府當局注意、稅率方面　萬萬不可再偏願洋商　而應該保護華商　一面減輕國貨稅率、一面增加洋商的捐稅、關稅保護政策、縱不能一旦實施　多少總要向這條路走纔對、如果我們的稅則實際上成了保護洋商、使華洋待遇受到大門反裝的不平等、那還成什麽話、如果政府不實行減輕捐稅　祇空口白紙、命令人家提倡國貨、工商界就該起來督促牠實行（三）集中資本、這一味藥、也是滋養的要藥　本國工廠資本的薄弱、不足以敵國内外資各廠、更足以敵大外國廠、前已說明、現在如國貨火柴一業　在瑞典商加重壓迫之下、已經感覺得非聯　經營不可、其實國貨事業、都應該趕快從集中資本入手、從事於較大量的生產、不過先要請主持公司的人、都尊重法律、尊重道德　尊重股東的權利　而股東一方面、也要不忘記自已的權利和責任　不要讓主持者作弊營私、然後中國公司的組織　可以立起相當的信用、然後可以用大公司的名義、吸收大量的資本　集中經營、如果還是各自小規模的幹、一輩子不能立足的　（四）科學管理、這好像是來路貨的外國新藥、時髦醫生要採用一下、其實並不爲牠是時髦而採用、爲牠是可以改進現在本國工廠的管理方法而採用　其目的　固然要設法增進工作的效率　節省無謂的消耗、似乎爲資方打算、但同時管理得法布置適宜以後、在工人方面、體力可以不致疲勞勤惰可以酬報如分、也未始不是爲勞方打算、何况大量生產　成本減輕、售價便宜、社會享福、其有裨益於一般的國民、更屬鉅大不過這味藥要如何用、如何服、須得各廠先有勞資合作的精神做基礎、再把搜羅人材、這件事情認眞做起來、方可對症發藥、一顯其科學的效用、否則一知半解的廠主或經理、假借良好名辭、過度壓迫、榨取工人的汗血　而美其名曰科學管理、那就非徒無益而又害之、好似某報記載鄉下有個醫生、拿了「阿司匹靈」、當作醫治腦膜炎的特效藥、騙鄉下人吞服、延誤送命一樣、又是一樁罪過、（五）休養生息、這也是很重要的一件事情　譬如大病臨頭、需要調養、服藥而外、看護尤須得宜　必有適於養病的環境、使病人幽居清靜、方可期其復元　否則於塵市煩囂之中、勞精疲神　病勢必致更深　現在國内工商業凋敝如此、半受戰事及匪禍影響、工商界應該知道　没有一個統一的政府、不會有和平的局面　没有和平的社會、决非發展實業之可能　故爲今之計　祗有用我們的力量、促成統一、要求政所實行編遣、嚴剿土匪、肅清共黨、安定閭閻、使得農產振興、交通靈便、則經過幾年休養生息的結果、國貨的工商業、自然會逐漸繁榮　總之、上面所說的五味藥、都是挽救國貨命運所必不可少的條件、我們如果眞心誠意的希望國貨發達　取洋貨而代之、那麽黨部政府以及工商界、都應該共同努力分負責任、庶幾國貨生產事業　逐漸發皇、可以供給國人的需要、做到自給自足的一步　則一般人的消費、自然都樂於採用國貨了、我們在這一届國貨運動大會裡、除了喚起一般人儘量購用國貨以外、所持以答謝熱心贊助諸君的、只有這麽一句誠懇的話、「大家共同努力、來解除國貨前途的困難、」十九·九·廿五·於上海　（完）</p>

<p>— 龍</p>
<p>▲舌以柔存。齒以副折。故吾人立言行事。不可太露鋒鋩。</p>
<p>▲返老還童術。如果成功。辟穀方必不可少。否則粥少僧多。人類爭殺。勢必愈烈。</p>
<p>▲從前的媒介婚姻。好像捉迷藏式。現在的自由戀愛。有些投機性質。</p>
<p>▲人心險詐。防不勝防。惟有不　名利者。才能免除一切煩惱。</p>
<p>▲結婚的一天。爲戀愛成功之日。也是愛情破裂之日。</p>
<p>▲世間自殺的人。一半果然因環境惡劣所致。一半還是能力薄弱的緣故。</p>
<p>▲男女間在互相愛慕之初。心中皆有說不出的樂趣。一旦結了婚。就覺得不過爾爾。</p>
<p>▲小孩子爲兩性間的結晶品。也是煩惱的根苗。因爲他不但要加重你的擔負。且有分你心上人的愛的魔力。</p>
<p>▲汽車本爲忙碌的人代步之用。可是坐者。無不欲其風馳電掣。瞬息即達。更多以兜風爲時髦之輩。無怪汽車傷人的新聞。要常常映入吾人眼簾了。</p>
<p>▲馬路上偶然發現一二個外國水手戴中國瓜皮帽。華人見之。莫不駭怪。回顧國人之洋裝革履。呢帽司的克。神氣活現者。比比皆是。恐怕碧眼兒也正在竊笑哩。</p>

<p>— 琅玕</p>
<p>今歲遼西水災奇重。東北長官張漢卿氏惄焉憂之。迭經設法籌振。上海方面。先之以聞人杜月笙君等所發起之名流義務戲。成績異常驚人。繼起者爲鄭毓秀博士主辦之空前化裝游藝大會。於雙十節後二日。假座戈登路大華飯店舉行。原定九時開會。詎至八時塲中已水洩不通。而後至者猶絡繹不絶。博士因腸病新愈。不耐煩勞。臨時由乃妹鄭慧琛女士等代爲照料。而兪子英楊肇熉許運宣諸君提調一切。非常忙碌。其熱心殊不可及也。</p>
<p>▲金光燦爛　開幕之先。由市政府公安局軍樂隊奏樂。繼之以兩江女子體育學校之舞蹈。與舞者五人。咸穿金縷之衣。映以電光。燦爛奪目。飄飄欲仙。宜乎掌聲之起於四座也。</p>
<p>▲光怪陸離　繼之爲光怪陸離之化裝跳舞。以張嘯林王曉籟兩君之興緻最濃。張御西服。兩目戴面具。口綴白鬚。儼然一外國土地。王以黑花紙遮目。面部微露笑容。而步伐整齊。儼然斵輪老手也。馮登那夫人穿春香鬧學中之戲裝。居然畢肖。鄭慧琛女士飾一黃天覇。聞其戲裝爲鄭博士所備。亦臨改由慧琛女士代飾者也。其餘五光十色。不及縷述。</p>
<p>▲國樂悠揚　其次由大同樂會之國樂。前曾在外交部園會中一聆雅奏。嘗擬以月白天高清風徐來兩語况之。實和平盛世之音也。聞該會之成立。得王曉籟之贊助不少。是夕王親爲和拍。亦可見其贊賞之誠矣。</p>
<p>▲葡萄大仙　明星公司之大葡萄仙子。乃此會精采節目之一。此歌劇原爲兒童游戲。今以大人飾之。無形中蓋已將仙子升級而爲大仙矣。胡蝶飾仙子。儀態萬方。歌喉尤嘹喨。將來拍製有聲影戲。大可有恃無恐矣。其餘諸人女角表情細膩。男角加以滑稽。均非兒童扮演之所能有也。正秋劍雲洪深步高諸君多在塲照料。儼然導演本領。</p>
<p>▲名伶歌舞　最後爲名伶程艶秋君之紅拂傳舞劍。程對於此次遼西水災。因北平振災會之請。早經匯捐洋二千元。此次慨允加入。完全義務。熱心可敬。舞劍之時。掌聲雷動。有多數西人均重道以觀。咸嘆賞不置。末因觀者要求高歌一曲。程因事關善舉。特别賣力。唱其得意之作柳迎春南綁子一段。以享觀衆。幾於一字一好。是日適值星期。大舞臺有日戲。程日夜登臺。雖極辛勞。而對於會中仍如此熱心。誠難能矣。</p>

<p>— 鄧春澍</p>
<p>余家於毘陵白雲溪上。蘇東坡之紫籐老屋。惲南田之甌香舊館。均隔溪相望。嘯歌書畫。寵辱都蠲。今夏旣遭元相之悲。益縱游山之興。日昨虞麓泛琴川。蘇門吊鶴逸。甫歸。而中秋前一日。鳴社同人。招游鴛湖。觴詠烟雨樓。更作泛月之舉。余乃轉滬而往。蘇浙詩人之來會者。少長又二十二人。孝廉如青浦徐公脩。吳興姚滌源。海寗陳亦陶。而周辨西大令自杭。顧燮光主事自越。戴伯行父子自　朱大可挈其十一齡之小可。先自滬來。提措一切。社題爲鴛湖棹歌。及泛月。於是開竹葉之舊醅。飫檇李之名饌。一舸容與。佳作紛陳。詩詠百篇。菱歌四起。座中畫家。惟吳江琴木及余兩人。乃分任繪朱庵探桂。鴛湖泛月二圖。即席親筆題名弁卷首。齒分長幼。小可亦能詠。酬對侃侃。咸以神童目之。三時舟達朱庵。庵傳自明代。庭有臺桂二樹。虬枝蟠曲。六七層如擎蓋。高逾丈六。洵三百年物。大可出示金畇老朱古微。諸名流題圖長卷。可寳也。三時回舟。同登烟雨樓。宛在水中。如西湖之小瀛洲。而廊榭參差。木石聳茂。湖天四望。菱塘蟹舍。盡入畫圖。旣而斜陽水面。奇幻畢呈。素月東升。烟景遞變。幽賞逾時。放乎中流。飽啖湖菱。各吟佳句。如姚丈有上下平七絶三十首。質庵賦水調歌頭。尤雅切也。余僅雜詠八章而已。旣而莊敬亭等六人返滬。姚徐陳吳。去海寗觀夜潮。余與寄凡燮光辨西赴杭。再泛月湖焉。余前年十月有太湖秋泛之圖。二月有五湖春泛之圖。上已有蘭亭脩禊之圖。皆與江浙藝林聞達。或十八人。或廿餘人。各有題記。登諸本談之中。而合之今游。圖適成其四矣。先時余游泰岱廬嶽。天台雁蕩歸。成勝游圖詠百六十幀。曾賦五山詩韻七律一首。茲於車中。又賦五湖詩一律云。浮過鄱湖泛太湖。尙湖游罷又鴛湖。嘯歌桂苑來琴水。觴詠蘭亭記鏡湖。坐擁圖書銷歲月。行看踪跡寄江湖。明朝又向西湖去。共賞中秋醉月湖。詩成。燮光曰。是誠七律之創格。亦可謂湖山之新詠矣。車抵杭。即草斯記以餉閱者。（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 周世勳</p>
<p>人生的過去。到了「回想」「辨别」的時候。一切的快樂。似乎都充滿了悲哀。我每感到如此。並且希望現在的我。少過些快樂的生活。免得悲哀的石城阻礙着我的前途。</p>
<p>國慶似乎值得我狂歡吧。但是坐在大華飯店的華光同樂會中。見到了舞。聞到了樂。好像都擁着利劍似的向我的耳目刺來。這大約是一種特殊的感想吧。我想坐在同一塲地的人羣之中。不至於再有第二個發現啊。</p>
<p>可是我並不麻木。我也同樣的拍手稱贊王慶勳的口琴。梁賽珍的粤曲。祇是從梁女士的歌喉之中。我又感到伊青春的喪失。而連帶替一般的青春少女提心吊膽。</p>
<p>李迪雲君是聯青社的健將。這次的游藝經他的調排。居然井井有條。他遇見了我。對我說。你久離上海嗎。呀、其實我何嘗離開過一天煩惱的上海。祇是熱鬧的集會之中。不能使我感着興趣而已。唉、繁華的上海。祇是我眼前的一條「煩惱之河」啊。</p>
<p>林澤蒼是我的老友。他的辦事精神却值得我欽佩。不過我每見到他受局外人的指斥。就使我發生一個奇想。普天下愛辦公共事業的人。總免不了貼本賠錢聽閒話。到底那一種事業能使每一個人覺得滿意。大約一等的聰明人。也找不出這個答案哩。</p>
<p>唉、人生、唉、快樂。經不住回想。經不得辨别。少嘗一分眼前的快樂。免除一分未來的悲哀。這就是我坐在大華同樂會中。由清歌妙舞之中得來的一個特殊的感想。不希望人們表同情。祇希望人們與我作同樣的辨别。</p>
<h3 id="c162">意大利美術考察記（一） <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 汪亞塵</p>
<p>▲文藝復興前後佛羅稜司的美術</p>
<p>意大利在十五世紀文藝復興前期的繪畫。以佛羅稜司爲中心。當時四方美術家接踵而至。著名的作家。那時候也都在佛羅稜司發揮各個人的技術。正像現在的畫家。都要走走巴黎相彷。所以那時的佛羅稜司畫風。吹遍了意大利全國。有這樣光輝的歷史。一到其地。對於從前留下美術上的遺蹟。使吾人參考不盡。街頭巷角。無一處不是藝術的痕蹟。一個旅行的人。踏到了佛羅稜司的土地。再没有使你不舒服的地方。尤其是研究美術的人們。</p>
<p>藝術的發源地　雖遠在希臘和埃及。可是藝壇上開得最爛熳的藝術之花。就不得不從佛羅稜司說起。該處建築·繪畫·雕刻·到現在還是集中的場所。歐洲習藝術的人。都要去瞻仰。我來歐考察藝術。想要跑的地方太多。今年四月下旬纔到了佛羅稜司。</p>
<p>現在那班野獸羣畫家說過。近代藝術家。不必拿古人的遺物來做幌子。只要向自然界和自己的内心去追求。但藝術總不能離了傳統。有前人的引誘。纔有多人的啟發。假使各國的藝術陳列館。都用火燒去。我想現在歐洲那班自命創造的藝術家。就要徬徨哩。我考察佛羅稜司文藝復興前後的藝術以後。有不能已於言者。特泚筆記之。以告國人。</p>
<p>（一）奥飛次Uffizi美術館。此館是從前意大利公爵奥飛次之私邸。自一五六零年。改爲美術館。至今仍沿用公爵之名。館在佛埠市内。前面即Vecchio古宫。後臨唯美Fiume河。館内陳列繪畫及雕刻四十餘點。其作品最先是梅狄西Medici所搜集。近數十年來又將各地精品彚併於内。現在已成爲世界著名美術館之一。自文藝復興盛期至十六世紀末葉。凡佛羅稜司派的藝術品。館内尤其豐富。意大利中部與南部的名家作品亦都齊集於内。尙有和蘭。西班牙。法國十六世紀至十九世紀的名作。分陳數室。</p>
<p>入館由右首登樓。二樓有一大間。陳列木版畫數百點。且有近代各國著名之木版畫家的作品甚多。現在歐洲各國對於木版畫。非常流行。各美術館。都有點綴。惟以奥飛次館所陳列者。爲最完備。</p>

<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　翠竹淚斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>蓮香是個好性子的人。伊想命裏注就是做姨太太的。即使他們的太太厲害。低頭服小一點。也就過去了。凡事總看老爺面上。現在我們所嫁的是老爺。並不是太太。只要老爺好說話。一切都由老爺擔任得去。况且在没有討蓮香的時候。看他常是深更半夜的回去。並没有懼怕家裏人的表示。因此蓮香也不放在心上。并且並不是住在一宅。原是在外面另借小公館的。剛過門的時候。大家說現象很好。雖然瞞過了雌老虎。却也一點没有破綻。但是過了幾個月。家裏人漸漸有些知道了。不過還没有知道他們的小公館在那裏。只知道老爺外面討了個人。怎樣的走漏風聲的呢。據說還是在下人們傳出來的。原來殷老爺出來。常常是坐一輛馬車。這馬車夫喚做根生。當然是殷老爺的心腹。凡是殷老爺每天所到的地方。别人不知道。那個馬車夫根生。没有不知道的。靠着老爺有這個秘密機關。他所賺的外快也不少。老爺時常吩咐他。家裏不要亂說。空口關照他。却有些兒不放心。没有法子。只有把金錢去關住他的口了。工錢是不用說。常常支空了幾個月。他到賬房裏去支工錢。賬房先生不肯付。他倒還要和賬房先生爭論。賬房先生只好請命於東家。東家却說這一回。讓他支一月吧。以後不許他再支。實在是東家有點怕他。後來只得關照他。你的工錢。不要到賬房裏去支。你要用錢。向我說好了。所以常常的說道。根生。你的棉袍子不好穿了。去買一件新的。又說你的帽子鞋子破了。去買頂新帽子。買雙新鞋子。給他十塊八塊錢是常常有的。但是那個根生。後來給太太的一個梳頭娘姨阿金姘上了。根生對於别人。自然一句話也不肯洩漏。對於阿金。再也守不住那個秘密的了。有一天。阿金說起老爺怕太太。根生鼻子裏哼了一聲道。女人終是不中用的。那裏可以一天到晚跟了男人走。女人隨便你怎樣怎樣兇。男人一轉背。就掉伊的槍花。他們那裏知道。阿金道。難道老爺也會掉槍花嗎。根生道。怎麽不會。他在家裏是不聲不響的。到了外面去。却是有說有笑。你們看他在家裏是規矩的。到了堂子裏。娘姨大姐。都要打打棚。要是你倘然到了堂子裏去。老爺也要給你打棚咧。</p>

<h3 id="c202">世界道路恊會解决汽車肇禍問題 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 志</p>
<p>▲頒定辦法五項　▲各國一致接受</p>
<p>車輛擁擠。汽車肇禍。都是目前形勢最嚴重的問題。可是各國都感覺到嚴重。而事實上仍是難於補救。現在這個困難問題。已有了相當的解决了。解决這個困難問題的。須是今年五月在華盛頓舉行的世界道路協會。</p>
<p>世界道路協會。是專論事實。不尙空談的。它在第一第二次大會裏。已將汽車限制律草成。當即送到各國去備用。結果自一九二六年起。二十三個國家。已實施採用。其餘大城市。更難僕數。所以在開宗明義第一章裏。對於世界道路協會。不得不致相當的敬意。</p>
<p>今年的大會。更有進步了。它最大的成績。是草成和修正了三種條例。一是劃一汽車律。（備政府用的）一是模範市政行車律（備各城市用的。第三是信號燈號以及</p>
<p>其他記號統一書。這三種書。自然又是世界的偉大供獻。在開會的那天。美國商務部長。也就是大會主席雷蒙氏。致詞。他說「關於汽車運輸問題。每天寄到商務部的。幾如雪片飛來。而且如戰訊一般的嚴重。汽車肇禍統計。單就美國論。一九二○年一二五○○件。至一九二五年增至二二○○○件。一九二八年二八○○○件。一九二九年竟加至三一○○○件。我們再來細細分析。一九二○年一○○○·輛汽車中有一三六輛是撞死人的。一九二五年僅有一一○輛。一九二六年一○七輛。可見得肇禍總數雖加。而比率反而縮小。可是至了一九二六年以後。情形又不同了。去年（一九二九）比率又高到一一七輛。</p>
<p>「比率誠然是高了。然而增加程度。並不見猛烈。這一點我們是採用相當的方法的。方法是什麽。第一。最重大的鐵路交叉處撞車。我們用種種方法。例如提高民衆敎育。加意宣傳之類。第二。小孩子是最容易被撞的、因爲他們天眞爛漫。不知利害。可是我們在學校裏提倡安全敎育。出了學校的門。我們又規定必須由大人接送。如此七年以來。小孩被撞率。增加了不到百分之二十五。第三。我們設立了一個統計委員會。由各省將肇禍統一。彚交前來。分類來研究。以設法補救。第四。最重要的。便是各城市。都能明瞭車輛情勢的嚴重。我是支加哥人。就拿支加哥來說。對於救濟車輛肇禍。解决車輛擁擠。都有顯明的成效。一九二九年汽車肇禍。比一九二八年减少了百分之二。其餘十四城。包括三藩市。聖絡易密爾瓦基等在内。情形都較前爲好。</p>
<p>以上是主席報告美國情形。再看世界道路協會的議决案吧。共分五大類。第一、施行車務法及規章辦法。第二、使用道路人的敎育法。第三、車輛肇禍統計。第四、建設及維護汽車法。第五、道路設備法等。關於第一項議决案。本文可以討論。其餘四項。將來再述吧。</p>
<p>論到施行車務法及規章辦法。大會認爲大多數的肇禍問題。起因都有相當的綫索。拿交叉路肇禍來講。大部分是因爲交叉處没信號設備的緣故。所以在劃一汽車法理這一點已有相當注意。再看汽車主人肇禍。不外幾項原因。最重要的。是違犯行車法。此須以違警律來嚴屬處置。其次不顧「左行律」的規定。明明應當靠左邊行的。而在無人地方。更不顧一切的亂行。所以也在法律中規定嚴禁。</p>
<p>最最重要的。是大會的結論。它說「要補救車輛肇禍問題。不但靠車務法而已。必須要得警務人員的協助。遇有發覺不合法度時。即行毫不徇情的加以制裁。其次要得法庭的同情。現在一件肇禍案。法庭看得很輕。幾元罰金。幾天監禁須完了。這種輕描淡寫。如何能免除汽車主人的粗心呢。所以這一點要請法庭來協助。第三。要有人民自身的覺悟。何以說呢。倒如人民自己出來組織一個委員會。專門監督市政府法庭的處斷問題。遇有不合。即代表民意正式的請求和建議。這樣大家合作起來。方纔能夠有希望。」</p>
<p>聽說。關於以上的建議。各國代表都欣然同意的贊同了。</p>
<h3 id="c203">福特廠之副產 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>▲廠中無一廢物</p>
<p>福特爲美國有數之汽車廠也。近年以來。營業日廣。獲利日多。大有一日千里之槪。然福特廠之有若是其發展。惟一原因。即在管理得宜。經營得法。蓋在福特廠中。不拘總廠分廠。一無棄去之廢物。其經營之法。實盡善而盡美也。即副產之收入。尤爲驚人也。</p>
<p>據福特廠之統計。則單就副產而言。設以一九二九年與一九二八年作一比較。則一九二九年增加二·五七○·一○○元之收入。蓋一九二八年全副業收入爲一六·七七四·六七二元。而一九二九年則有一九·三四四·三七三元也。此種報告。由廠方傳出。故頗爲可靠。當此商戰日烈之時。營業之成敗。惟賴管理之得宜與否。如福特廠近年副產收入之增加。旣足減少一切費用。又可使出品價值低減。使廠中無一廢物。棄而勿用。廢物利用。乃一舉而兩得之事也。</p>
<p>福特廠中。無一廢物。上文已言之矣。各種原料。唯一用途、在製造汽車。此固人盡皆知者也。然除製造汽車而外。尙可產生無數副物。或則在市塲出售。或則運往各地分廠應用。去年之副產。單就出售者言。則收入之數。竟在一九·○○○·○○○元以上。然此外各種副產。由福特廠自用者。其數當亦在數百萬元之譜。去年出售之副產。盈餘最多者。莫如各種碎片。總價爲五·六七二·○○○元。較之前年增加有二·○五三·○○○元之多云。</p>
<p>去年福特廠所出各種副產之中。煤炭一項。出售之價值。亦在二·七五八·○○○元以上。蓋福特廠在肯得基及西佛及尼亞。均有開採煤礦之廠。以供自用。除自用外。售諸他人。所出之煤。一方由鐵路運往各地煤商。銷售於中美各地。一方由德路支福特船塢運出。以供西北各地分廠之用。在煤礦之中。福特廠又可得副產</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>骸炭。去年全年之價值。亦在四·三一三·○○○元之上。而且骸炭之中。又鍊出安母紐謨鹽酸八二五·○○○元。由各地福特廠經售處。設法推銷。此種鹽酸。近來用途頗廣。鍊取骸炭之時。所用輕油亦可在油中得炭化水素。以供地屈勞苦各油站之用。去年所售之價。亦有二·三五七·○○○元。</p>
<p>福特在米西根北部。所設鋸木廠中。所有木片木屑。設法蒸溜後。亦可得有副產。如木炭及其化學用品。去年木炭一物。所得售價。爲五○九·○○○元。較前年出超一四七·○○○元。他若橡皮軟木。人工皮革等。去年亦增加二三七·○○○元之收入。而全年之銷數。則爲五六一·○○○元。</p>
<p>鐵渣鐵屑。由煤爐中噴出者。可鍊成波得蘭水門泥。去年售出之價值。爲一·○三二·○○○元。其他鐵屑。購買之人。用以築路者。計一六九·○○○元。餘剩之煤氣。在地屈勞售於一家煤氣公司。去年共得三七三·○○○元。玻璃片由廠方自行製造者。用餘之後。售出者五七九·○○○元。而米西根鋸木廠所售出之木片。則爲三六·○○○。喬遜規尺。出產頗多。去年售得一○二·○○○元。此種規尺。由金屬製成。世界各國。最爲通用。且經美國度量委員認爲標準尺度者。福本特製造之初。本擬自用。近因自用而外。尙有餘多。故設法出售。觀乎上文之種種。可知福特車廠。每年副產之收入。亦屬不少也。</p>
<h3 id="c204">蘇俄發展汽車及道路事業 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 沛甘</p>
<p>▲每年造汽車十萬輛</p>
<p>蘇俄全國現在所有之道路計長三百萬基羅密達。但其中適合於駛行汽車者爲數甚少。統計之不過五萬基羅密達而已。是以目下蘇俄國内各區域。各城市。各郊外。各鄉村之道路情形。可以上述之槪况推測之而得其大勢也。</p>
<p>照此種情况而言。蘇俄國内之道路。不久必須改革。可以斷言。蘇俄國人。現有一種極普遍之感想。即實業中心區域及人口繁密之地。必須有適宜之汽車道路是也。現在蘇俄國内因缺乏良好道路。故所有汽車連公共汽車及運貨車等統計之。爲數不過二萬一千餘輛而已。因無良好之道路。故汽車事業無從得其發展之機會。因汽車之出產稀少而道路問題亦弗爲人所重視。斯二者互爲因故焉。不過最近蘇俄國内有一種新組織。名曰汽車道路會。其宗旨在實現汽車及道路兩項之急速進展。</p>
<p>此汽車道路會運用其全力。以喚起蘇俄全國民衆。注意於道路之建設及汽車之使用。總部設於莫司科。分會則到處皆有。辦事上總部與分會互相聯絡。該會第一目標。係求於十年之内。完成一百萬基羅密達之平舖大道。及四百五十萬基羅密達之舖礫道路。此項道路將在人口繁衆之區建造。自在意中。而其成效亦自可觀也。</p>
<p>一九二九年時。莫司科省指定以五、四一一、○○○元。建築莫司科城之各大道路。另撥一○、二四○、○○○元作全省新路之建造費。一千九百二十五年莫司科城始有公共汽車之組織。及至今日乃成爲公衆交通及運輸上不可或缺之利器。一九二八年之末莫司科全城有公共汽車一百六十輛。然此數尙屬求過於供。更因街道狹隘。行人擁擠。故公共汽車之駛行大感不易。及照一九二九年之新計劃。新添車輛不少。而道路亦多擴展。目下蘇俄全境内。百分之一之半之道路係舖沙礫者。少數爲舖石大道。不過其餘則係泥路建築甚爲簡陋也。</p>
<p>蘇俄現在擬製造大宗之汽車以應亟需。照汽車道路會之計劃。每年之汽車產量須達十萬輛之多。苟道路之需要不能與汽車之需要相互並進。斯亦有反乎常情者也。因之目下之蘇俄人民除需良好之道路外。又逐漸廣用汽車運貨車及公共汽車以利運輸。在此種情况之下。今後五年之中。蘇俄之注意造路事業。將較世界各國爲尤甚。政府人員深知良好汽車路之建造較之築造鐵道。其費節省甚多。而利益亦較鐵路爲大。造路之工程師大都返自外國。深明種種利益。且又經騐充足。蘇俄政府極願外國旅客往其各地游覽。而知良好之道路及汽車旅行爲此項企圖之最大臂助焉。</p>
<p>今後數年在道路發展中將佔一席重地位者。厥爲合組農田事業之發達是也。鐵道路線不能直達五十萬或一百萬畝之大農田。事甚彰明。於是農用之運貨汽車必將大用。汽車運輸之經濟實用。及國家農塲之鼓吹。良好之道路必能解决一切農事運輸上之需要。至於汽車道路會各領袖之進取精神。其能完成全國道路計劃。尤必意中事耳。</p>
<h3 id="c205">服務爲商業之要道 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 吉人</p>
<p>▲推銷貨物之先鋒　▲汽車業應注重之</p>
<p>商務貿易。雙方賣買。咸以貨交事畢。不負責任。此數千年來之商情也。近年工商發達。競爭日烈。欲謀擴充營業。招徠生意。必須迎合主顧之心理。得到顧客之滿意。此無他。惟服務耳。</p>
<p>即數年前。汽車之交易尙然、廠方將車輛售於買主。若機身無弊與駕駛如意者。即爲責任完畢。而車主旣得其車。自覺稱心者。亦無他求。</p>
<p>近年商情大變。營業日艱。車主購置一車。非但求其當時車機動作之優美。而且要求將來長期服務之保障。庶使所化之本。得有十足利益。然於廠家方面。不得不順車主之心理。在世界各地設立分行。服務站。修理站與零件棧等等。從事服務。以擴營業。因此又加添一種開支。爲數亦甚鉅大。</p>
<p>今世汽車服務最完美者推爲全球最大之美國通用汽車製造總廠。規模之大。世無其匹。該廠現在大小一百十四國設立分廠。各地均有服務處。今通用汽車。日行於道者。已逾七百萬輛。可見其盛行之一般。據該廠駐華上海分行之服務主任麥克唐納氏云。服務非但爲車行之責任。尤爲推銷車輛之要素。蓋車主得有完美之服務。心滿意足。口頭宣傳。效力比諸廣告尤大。推銷比較談說尤騐。</p>
<p>今日通用車主。不論往來何處。自携汽車。無容憂慮。蓋各地就近必有通用經理之服務站。請有專門人才爲之修理服務。美國通用汽車製造總廠深知服務與營業之密切關係。不借鉅金。從事設立各車之服務處。並有零件主任與服務主任及代表等常與經理聯絡商議。互相合作。同時創辦通用服務學校。敎練專門人物。以備將來服務國人。其設計之遠。服務之周。可爲汽車界之模範矣。</p>

<p>The Russian Side Still Lacks Sincerity in Resolving Issues</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Sino-Russian Conference already opened in Moscow on the 11th. According to Karakhan's opening speech, the Russian side still lacks sincerity in resolving the issues related to the Boli (Khabarovsk) Record. Many telegrams sent by our country's representatives have been detained. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Office of the Director-General of the Chinese Eastern Railway received a telegram from Moscow on the 12th, stating that after Karakhan's speech at the Sino-Soviet Conference on the 11th, both sides were exchanging credentials. The Russian plenipotentiary suddenly requested that the Chinese plenipotentiary formally declare recognition of the Boli Record, which led to a dispute. Because it was late, the meeting adjourned without results. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Office of the Director-General of the Chinese Eastern Railway received a telegram from Moscow on the 11th, stating that the formal Sino-Russian Conference opened at noon on the 11th. The location was the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee. Karakhan delivered the opening speech, and Mo Dehui responded. The discussion of various issues began on the 12th, with commercial issues being discussed first. (13th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Sino-Russian negotiations, which reopened on the 11th, have once again come to a standstill due to the Boli Protocol issue. This is because the Soviet Russian side is demanding that China recognize and confirm the Boli Protocol, which concerns the restoration of the Chinese Eastern Railway to its original state and the effective suppression of the White Russian army. Mo Dehui sternly rejected this, stating that China could not formally and unconditionally recognize the said Protocol. It is anticipated that there may be further disturbances in the future.

<p>Chiang Agrees to Restore the 13th Route Army Title; Shi Yousan No Longer Has Good Feelings Towards Feng</p>
<p>(Jinan) Shi Yousan sent Qin Jianbin to Jinan to meet with Han Fuqu and Chiang Bo Cheng, requesting that they contact the Central Government on his behalf to discuss his pledge of allegiance, requesting four conditions: (1) Title, (2) Military Pay, (3) Place of Residence, (4) Willingness to attack Jin. Chiang Bo Cheng immediately telegraphed Chiang for instructions. Chiang replied, agreeing to restore Shi's 13th Route Army title and ordering him to obey the command of Zhang Xueliang in Liaoning. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Qin Jianbin stated that Shi's main forces are stationed in Zhangde, Weihui, and Xinxiang. In Zhangde, Shi confiscated several thousand rifles from the Jin army. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shi Yousan's troops have completely changed to yellow armbands and are advancing towards Shijiazhuang. Feng did not go to Shi. On the 8th, he retreated to Zhongyidian on the north bank of the Yellow River. After meeting with Lu Zhonglin and Sun Liangcheng, he detoured to Matun Town on the Daoqing Railway. The town is twelve li from Jiaozuo and is a rich source of sesame oil. Feng never passed through Xinxiang. Sun Dianying arrived in Matun on the 10th to see Feng. Feng held Sun's hand and cried bitterly. Five or six thousand of Sun's troops arrived in Yanjin. Central government aircraft flew to Xinxiang to distribute leaflets urging the Northwest Army to surrender, but did not drop bombs. The plan of Feng's army to cut off the Yellow River Bridge was due to the large number of retreating people, making it impossible to provide for them. Shi Yousan has posted slogans in Zhangde Station supporting the Northeast’s clever telegram. Feng sent Zhang Yunrong and Liu Ji with personal letters to see Shi, requesting him to obey to the end. Shi replied that Feng had not treated allied troops well in the past. As a result, Feng did not dare to go to Xinxiang to see Shi. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Feng also sent a personal letter to Yan and Wang, saying that if a road is impassable, one should turn back and find a new path. After Yan and Wang received Feng's letter, they held meetings on the 11th and 12th. On the morning of the 13th, Wang left Shijiazhuang for Taiyuan, preparing to go abroad. Yan returned to Yangquan. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Also wired, Some important members of the Jin faction here advocate that the responsibility for this failure should be entirely attributed to Wang, with some measures taken against Wang to reduce Yan's responsibility. However, the majority believe that Wang's reputation has already been severely affected after coming to the north empty-handed, and of course, he should not be held responsible for this military action. (14th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Qingdao Mayor Hu Ruoyu arrived in Tianjin from Shenyang on the 13th. According to reliable sources, Mr. Hu, along with Mr. Wei Daofeng, Zhang Xueliang's representative who has been stationed in Beiping for the past year, will serve as Zhang's special envoys and go to Shijiazhuang in the next day or two to meet with Yan Xishan and Feng Yuxiang, advising them to step down. (14th Day Diantong News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person here returned to Beiping from Shijiazhuang today. According to him, at the meeting on the 11th, Wang Jingwei, along with several comrades, came to Shijiazhuang from Taiyuan. Feng Yuxiang, who was in Jiaozuo, sent Liu Ji and Zhang Yinrong to attend the meeting. As a result, Yan, Feng, Wang, and others decided to step down. (14th Day United Press)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Longjing Village Incident <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Japan's diplomacy today has changed from its previous policy of military aggression. The Japanese authorities' diplomacy towards China has changed from its previous cunning tactics and seeks to advance friendship. I also believe this. However, the Japanese military police in the Yanbian area of ​​Eastern Three Provinces often engage in transgressive actions. Why has the authorities not been heard to stop them?</p>
<p>Although Japan has changed its policy of military aggression, it has not changed its consistent and traditional claim over the Eastern Provinces. Although Japan wants to implement friendship with China, it has not abandoned the idea of ​​a special relationship with the Eastern Provinces. As a result, the Japanese garrison troops and police along the road in the Eastern Provinces have not changed their previous contempt for the Chinese people, and still follow their usual rude and unreasonable practices. This is the reason why cases of Japanese military police surrounding agencies and kidnapping police officers have repeatedly occurred in Yanbian. In the recent Longjing Village negotiation, the Japanese police fired shots to provoke within our sentry line for no reason. Afterwards, they used the pretext to open up a large number of armed Japanese police to parade in a show of force, causing local merchants and residents to panic and send telegrams for assistance. This kind of behavior is very harmful to Sino-Japanese relations. Yanji is in the Eastern Provinces, and has the most disputes involving China, Korea, and Japan. It is the most likely fuse to ignite conflict. If the Japanese authorities still favor the Japanese police, believe the propaganda of the Japanese newspapers, and fail to take fair and appropriate action, there will be many negotiations in the future. How will the relations between the two countries improve? Therefore, I say that whether the Japanese government has sincere friendship can only be judged by its attitude towards this issue.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Yunnan Provincial Government recently consulted the Ministry of Interior, stating that the powers of the provincial daoyin have been abolished in accordance with the Ming order. However, in order to consolidate border defense, it seems appropriate to specially establish border colonization agencies to handle this matter exclusively. The First and Second Border Colonization Commissioner's Offices have now been established along the southwestern border, specializing in border defense, and the regulations have been reviewed and promulgated. After the consultation, the Ministry of Interior believes that Yunnan is located in a remote southern border, and judging from its political geography, it seems that these agencies can be specially established. However, the duties of these offices, such as border demarcation, reclamation, and defense, all involve national administration and should not be handled entirely by local governments. The title of Commissioner is also inappropriate. It has been submitted to the government for verification. If it is recognized that there is a need to establish special administrative agencies in the border areas of Yunnan, the original plan should be sent to the Legislative Yuan to formulate organizational charters that comply with laws and regulations.

<p>Brown-Shirt Comrades Demonstrate</p>
<p>Countless Shop Windows Smashed</p>
<p>Political and Economic Difficulties Abound</p>
<p>International Loan Ready to be Accepted</p>
<p>▲ National Society, Berlin, 13th dispatch: The new German Parliament convened this afternoon for its inaugural meeting. Although the agenda only included a formal roll call, when Herold, the oldest member of the Center Clerical Party, declared the meeting open, the audience was already full. One hundred and seven members of the Nazi Party, all wearing the party's brown uniforms and badges, were booed. Although this violated the Prussian order, since members of parliament are immune from sanctions, fortunately, no accident occurred in the parliament today, except for the usual jeers from the left and right wings. However, the atmosphere remained tense until the adjournment was announced. The next meeting will be on Thursday, when the speaker will be elected, which is expected to be a fierce competition. According to custom, the speaker's seat should belong to the Social Democratic Party, which has the most seats. However, most members of parliament seem eager to compete with the party for the speakership. As for outside the parliament, countless spectators gathered since early morning. At first, they were directed by the police, but later, members of the National Socialist Party arrived in droves and became uncontrollable. Some even threw stones at the police, forcing them to use batons to maintain order. In the afternoon, a large contingent of mounted police and reserve police were called in to block traffic around the parliament. The spectators grabbed paving stones and threw them at the police. In the Tiergarten Park nearby, hired vagrants clashed with the police until the police fired warning shots into the air, causing them to scatter into the crowd. After the parliament adjourned, members of the National Socialist Party marched in formation, with the police following to maintain order. Upon reaching the Postdamer Square, the crowd stood shoulder to shoulder like a wall, shouting the slogan "Germany Awake." Then, they led the crowd to smash the glass windows of Jewish department stores. It is estimated that 55 stores near the square and nearly 200 store windows of other Jewish stores and banks were destroyed. The police used batons to disperse them, but to no avail. All reserve police were mobilized to patrol and protect the commercial areas until order was restored in the evening. Political figures generally believe that this kind of riot is a sign of the urgency of the situation and that strict measures should be taken to respond. However, the cabinet cannot gather a majority of seats in parliament, and internal rifts are emerging. The Economic Party suddenly decided to withdraw its Minister of Justice, Dr. Braed, from the party. Fortunately, President Hindenburg reportedly urgently summoned Dr. Braed and persuaded him not to resign, thus averting the danger. Although the reason for the Economic Party's move has not been announced, it is widely believed to be due to Prime Minister Bruning's proposal to cooperate with the Social Democratic Party. However, if the current government does not cooperate with the Social Democratic Party, it will not be able to overcome the difficulties in parliament. In addition to political difficulties, Germany is also facing economic turmoil. Berlin metalworkers have overwhelmingly rejected an 8% wage cut, and arbitration is expected to be announced by noon tomorrow. In addition, the General Federation of Trade Unions has also resolved to demand a general reduction in working hours to 40 hours per week in order to absorb the unemployed, and to demand amendments to the reparations agreement, because the amount of reparations paid by Germany has exceeded the cost of repairing the war damage. The current reparations burden on the German people has affected the living conditions of workers to an intolerable extent. With so many difficulties coming at once, although the Ministry of Finance has reached an agreement with the American Reeve Corporation for a $122.5 million loan at 6%, with a term of two years, which can be established once approved by parliament, the announcement of this news still cannot reduce the pessimism of all parties.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 13th dispatch: At today's meeting of the new parliament, all ink bottles and other items that could be used as weapons were removed in advance to prevent the National Socialists and Communists from staging a full-scale martial arts performance at the opening meeting. When members of the National Socialist Party entered the venue, wearing brown shirts and trousers and decorated in a special way, the audience burst into laughter. The Communists wore regular clothes. Before long, Goebbels, the leader of the Social Democratic parliamentary group, entered from outside. The Brown-Shirt comrades cheered, while others responded with sarcastic laughter. There was a threat of disturbances in the parliamentary chamber during the opening procedures, but nothing happened in the end. The meeting was adjourned until the 15th. Many demonstrators gathered outside the parliament, some shouting booing slogans, others chanting communism, each according to their party affiliation. Foot and mounted police were engaged in expulsions, arresting 80 people. Unexpectedly, the Nazi Party attacked the lively streets unprotected by the military police, smashing the glass windows of shops, cafes, and hotels owned by Jews, leaving nothing intact. The chaos subsided quickly, but not a single pane of glass was left unbroken in the area occupied by the Wei Xie Mu Department Store on Leipzig Street.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 14th dispatch: The Police Chief issued a statement stating that there was no looting during yesterday's unrest in Berlin, because the police rushed to the scene of the incident quickly upon hearing the alarm and arrested 50 perpetrators. All those arrested were members of the National Socialist Party. They did not want Berlin's reputation to be tarnished by such absurd behavior, so they will adopt their strict aspect in dealing with those who disrupt the peace in the future.</p>
<p>▲ National Society, Berlin, 14th dispatch: German President Hindenburg met with Prussian Prime Minister Braun this afternoon to discuss the political situation. Because Braun is an important leader of the Social Democratic Party, it is widely believed that this move will have a significant impact on the fate of the federal government and the resolution of other important issues. As for the current situation in Berlin, although it appears to be stable on the surface, the political and business circles are in a state of panic, as if an incident is imminent. Yesterday's riot by members of the National Socialist Party subsided slightly in the evening, but re-ignited late at night and continued to disturb the streets near Poottersmoer until dawn today. Many shop windows were destroyed, and the police arrested 108 people, 32 of whom will be charged with resisting arrest. The Berlin Police Commissioner announced today that if there are any further attempts to disrupt order, the police will do their utmost to stop them. The order in the city has been fully restored this afternoon, but a large number of police are patrolling and security is tight in the area where the incident occurred yesterday. Newspapers have condemned this act of disrupting public order. Leaders of the National Socialist Party are also concerned about losing popular support and have issued declarations attempting to shift the responsibility for the incident to communist elements, but according to the police department, all those arrested are members of the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 13th dispatch: The $122.5 million loan to the German government, proposed by the American, German, Swedish, and Dutch banking groups, with an annual interest rate of 4.75% and an annual commission of 1.25%, is subject to the condition that the State Council and the National Assembly must approve the debt repayment plan. If this plan is approved, Germany must establish a reserve fund to repay all of Germany's outstanding debts of 125 million marks in stages within three years, as well as the currently proposed loan of $122.5 million. The State Council has now approved the government to accept the above-mentioned loan of $122.5 million.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Truth About the Incident Caused by Japanese Police in Longjing Village <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>▲ Japanese Increase Police Force Under Pretext After Ignoring Restraints</p>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch reports, according to reliable sources, the true story of the clash between Japanese police and Chinese army in Longjing Village, Yanji. It is said that on the evening of the 6th of this month, at 9 p.m., more than ten armed men were discovered in front of the army哨所 (sentry post) on Xin’an Street, Longjing Village, Yanji City. While being questioned, the other party suddenly opened fire. The sentries returned fire in self-defense, and later it was found that two people were killed and one injured. They were Japanese police. Consequently, Director Zhang of the city questioned the Japanese Consul-General. The next day, more than a hundred armed Japanese police attempted to travel from the Korean border to Longpu by the Tiantu train. Director Zhang again negotiated with Japanese Consul Okada to prevent this. However, the Japanese police ignored the restraints and marched to Longpu on foot, arriving on the 8th. On the same day, when the station opened, more than a hundred Japanese police came from Shangsanfeng, intending to enter the country via the river. At present, the area is strictly guarding against 共匪 (communist bandits) and is under martial law. The Japanese</p>

<p>still increase the police force under pretext. It is reported that Commander Zhang has already telegraphed strict orders to his troops to deal with the situation carefully. The following are two telegrams from Longjing Village: (1) Longjing Village is an important town on the Yanbian border, and has been under martial law for several months due to 防共 (anti-communism). However, on the night of the 6th of this month, at 10 p.m., more than ten armed men suddenly advanced in two groups towards the front of our 延平路 (Yanping Road)哨區防所 (sentry zone defense post). When our sentries tried to stop them, they opened fire. Our sentries returned fire in self-defense, killing two and injuring one. An investigation revealed that the two killed were wearing Japanese police uniforms, one holding an 八昔 (eight-year style) pistol and the other holding a 三八式 (Type 38) rifle. According to Matsuo, the patrol chief of the Japanese Consulate, the injured person was a clerk named Takahashi, and the killed were Japanese police officers Yoshioka and Fujita. No terms of negotiation have yet been put forward, but more than a hundred armed Japanese police arrived from Hayata, Korea, on the 9th and immediately held a parade, causing panic among merchants and civilians. It is reported that they intend to increase the police force continuously. Considering that this is a period of martial law, the fact that more than ten armed Japanese police are parading at night proves their intention to provoke trouble. Furthermore, they are using this as an excuse to increase the police force and freely enter our mainland, plotting to cause chaos. The facts are obvious. Japanese newspapers are altering the facts to spread counter-propaganda, and we request that this be corrected immediately. For the sake of national salvation, the merchants and civilians of Yanbian are indignant and would rather die. We hope that everyone will uphold justice and resist 強權 (the powerful). Sincerely, Yanbian Agricultural, Commercial, and Scholastic United Association of Longjing Village. (2) On the afternoon of the 6th of this month, at 9 p.m., a Chinese pear seller named Yang in Funing Hutong, Longjing Village, Yanji, had a quarrel and fight with a Korean named Ji Jizhun for stealing pears. The Chinese was seriously injured. At that time, both the Chinese and Korean sides were preparing to go to the 商埠局 (treaty port bureau) to argue their case. It happened that the treaty port police came to mediate. Suddenly, many Japanese police arrived and tried to arrest our police and the Chinese together. The Chinese people were outraged and protested to the Japanese police. The Japanese police were furious and fired a shot to intimidate the crowd. At that time, hearing the gunshot, the Japanese police station on Datong Road sent out four or five more Japanese police, who forcibly took our police away. When the treaty port bureau heard about this, it immediately sent a translator and two policemen to negotiate with the Japanese police station. The Japanese police station admitted that it was a misunderstanding and handed our police back to the translator of the treaty port bureau. This matter was concluded. Afterwards, the Japanese police provoked trouble for no reason, leading to another misunderstanding. This is a separate matter, and we are afraid that distant reports may be inaccurate. We hereby declare this by telegram. Sincerely, Yanbian Agricultural, Commercial, and Scholastic United Association of Longjing Village.</p>

<p>▲ Direct Trip from Beiping to Jilin Takes Only 37 Hours</p>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang reports that to facilitate national transportation, the Beining Railway convened a joint transportation conference in Tianjin in April of this year, gathering the Shenhai, Jihai, and Jidun Railways to establish direct transportation between Beiping and Jilin and to set a date for its realization. It was decided that joint transportation would begin on July 1st, and various transportation methods were discussed and agreed upon. Subsequently, due to special circumstances, the Shenhai Railway requested a postponement, which was extended repeatedly. Eventually, both the Beining and Shenhai Railways were affected by flooding, with numerous交通 (transportation) obstructions and damages, leading to the indefinite delay of the joint transportation plan. As the floods gradually receded and transportation on all routes was restored, the Beining Bureau and the Shenhai Bureau negotiated several times by letter and telegram, deciding to hold another conference, changing the location to Shenyang Shenhai Railway. The Tianjin General Bureau of the Beining Railway then sent Section Chief Zhou Songxian and others to Shenyang. At the same time, the Jihai and Jidun Railways also sent representatives to Shenyang to attend the meeting. On September 10th, the Northeast Four Railways Joint Transportation Conference was held, and all proposals were mostly passed. The only dispute was over the connection time, with a difference of only five minutes. Later, the Beining Railway showed concession, agreeing to the Shenhai Railway's request, and set the opening date for October 1st. This was later changed to October 10th, and finally, at a joint meeting on September 27th, it was set for October 16th. The travel time between Beiping and Jilin will only be 37 hours. It will depart from Beiping at 8:30 a.m., arrive in Shenyang at 6:50 a.m. the next day, arrive in Chaoyangzhen at 3 p.m., and arrive in Jilin at 8:40 p.m. It will depart from Jilin at 6:45 a.m., arrive in Chaoyangzhen at 11:45 a.m., arrive in Shenyang at 4:50 p.m., and arrive in Beiping at 4:45 p.m. the next day.

<p>A dispatch from Harbin reports that the joint venture of Northeast shipping merchants to revitalize the shipping industry has been decided during Shen Honglie's recent visit to Harbin. Shen returned to Liaoning on the evening of the 7th. Previously, shipping merchants convened a meeting on the 5th, inviting Shen to attend and agreeing on a 26-article outline of the joint venture charter. Shen delivered a speech, hoping that after the establishment of the joint shipping affairs, three points should be noted internally: (1) Every owner should have the right to participate in meetings and express opinions to avoid being manipulated and dominated by a few people. (2) Finances must be transparent to avoid abuses in spending. (3) Personnel and administration must follow the will of the majority to avoid isolation, disorganization, and mutual suspicion. Three points should also be noted externally: (1) Sincerely treat customers and maintain the usual spirit. (2) From now on, business should be conducted according to a business system, without official overtones. (3) If customers entrust matters for handling, they should be handled immediately, without delaying for excuses. Maintaining the friendship of each individual is equivalent to attracting a portion of business for the public. At 4 p.m. on the afternoon of the 8th, all shipping merchants gathered again at the shipping industry association to discuss the charter, revising the organizational outline passed on the 5th, and decided to elect appraisers on the 14th of this month, with a quota of 21 people. The Northeast Joint Shipping Bureau will nominate five people, Guangxin Shipping Office will nominate two people, and the remaining 14 will be mutually elected by the merchant groups, but with preference given to those with experience. Once nominated, preparations will begin for organizing the Northeast Shipping Joint Business Office. (8th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">National Match Merchants Oppose Swedish Merchants' Monopoly Rights in China <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Petition the Government for a Clear Reply</p>
<p>Since the invasion of the Chinese match industry by Swedish matches, it has suffered losses year after year and is on the verge of collapse. Appeals have been made repeatedly, causing a stir throughout the country. Recently, there has been news that Swedish merchants are seizing the exclusive right to sell matches in China. Chinese merchants, upon hearing this, are extremely alarmed. Therefore, the Guangdong Match Trade Business Association and the National Match Industry Federation have petitioned the government, demanding that the Swedish merchants' conspiracy be made public and that all members across the country be notified of the progress. The original text is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Petition from the Guangdong Match Trade Business Association: The rumor of Swedish match loans has spread at home and abroad. We appeal for a clear instruction to dispel public doubts and avoid industrial and commercial panic. Our country's match manufacturing industry has suffered miserably in recent years from the oppression and economic invasion by the Swedish merchant Rui Zhong, the match king, using the 托辣斯 (trust). We have repeatedly petitioned the Ministry to maintain order. Furthermore, in November of last year, the National Match Industry Association went to Nanjing to petition. Chairman Jiang and your Minister graciously agreed to find ways to maintain order. We admire the government's sincerity in promoting domestic goods and safeguarding industry and commerce. However, our country has been plagued by years of war and commerce has declined to its limit. Moreover, the government is facing a severe shortage of funds, and the raw materials for match imports are subject to taxes on top of taxes, and levies on top of levies. The burden of public debt and treasury bonds is heavy, leading to irreversible ruin. The Swedish Match Trust believes that the time to overwhelm our country's match manufacturing has arrived, and it is taking advantage of the low import taxes on foreign matches to continuously devalue and import them, making it impossible to sell our country's more expensive domestic matches. As a result, goods are piling up like mountains, and we have to sell them cheaply at a loss, enduring the pain to maintain turnover. However, our country's match manufacturers have meager capital and cannot compete with the wealthy and powerful Swedish Match Trust, which dominates the world. As a result, nearly half of our country's match industries have gone bankrupt one after another. Those that remain still hope that the time for national reconstruction has arrived and that they can somehow turn around. Therefore, they are barely surviving, waiting for recovery. Unexpectedly, the shocking news of Swedish match loans has spread at home and abroad. Newspapers in Guangzhou and Hong Kong have published that the Swedish Match Trust has recently made a loan to our country, with the condition that Swedish matches have a patent in China for several years. Alas, we believe that the day the Swedish match loan is established will be the day that hundreds of our country's match manufacturers declare their doom. The public is panicked and the whole country is in uproar. However, we merchants believe that the newspaper reports may be just rumors and are not credible. Just as we were bewildered, the Swedish Match Trust spread rumors everywhere, saying that the Swedish match loan has been finalized and that a small amount has already been delivered to our country. In Hong Kong, the Swedish manager sent people to buy up the 土造 (domestic) match factories in Guangdong in order to monopolize them. We merchants carefully considered the various conspiracies of the Swedish Match Trust over the years to destroy our country's domestic match industry, aiming to achieve a dominant position as a tool for monopoly. If this match loan becomes a reality and they are allowed to have a patent in our country, will our country's domestic match industry still have any hope? Moreover, we have repeatedly presented to your Ministry the situation of our country's match industry suffering from foreign merchant invasion and monopoly, appealing for ways to rescue us and maintain our country's dying match enterprises. Fortunately, we were allowed to maintain order and orders were distributed to various provinces to encourage the purchase and use of domestic matches in order to slightly reduce the trend of foreign merchant invasion. Before long, the shocking news of Swedish match loans has arrived again. The bad news has spread and the public is panicked. However, the truth of this rumor is unknown, or it may be spread by newspapers. Newspapers in Guangzhou and Hong Kong have published this, and it is presumed that newspapers in various provinces have also spread it. Therefore, we do not dare to be presumptuous and rashly present this to your Ministry for review and humbly request a clear instruction to dispel public doubts and avoid industrial and commercial panic. We also humbly request whether the Ministry can issue a notice to stop the conspiracy of the Swedish match merchants. We humbly beg for a decisive decision and implementation. Respectfully presented to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the National Government. Sincerely, Guangdong Match Trade Business Association.</p>
<p>▲ Petition from the National Match Industry Federation: We are submitting a report based on the facts, requesting verification and reply so that we can inform and dispel public doubts. We, the Federation, have received a letter from the Guangdong 土造 (domestic) Match Trade Business Association stating that they have recently heard rumors that the government has signed a loan agreement with Swedish match merchants, allowing the merchants a 50-year patent in China, with an initial loan of 5 million, and subsequent additional loans, to be handled by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. If this matter is realized, our country's match industry will surely be overthrown. We have learned that when our colleagues went to Beijing last year to petition, Minister Kong personally gave instructions to strongly maintain order. Now that the rumors are as such, although we dare not easily believe them, we are still afraid that they are not without cause. Please quickly submit a report for inquiry and reply to dispel public doubts. Based on this, although this rumor is a fabrication, external rumors are rife, and match manufacturers cannot avoid harboring worries because of this. Seeking clarification is also in line with common sense. Therefore, we dare to submit a report based on the facts, humbly requesting that your Ministry condescend to verify and reply so that we can inform and dispel public doubts, and we will be eternally grateful. Respectfully presented to Liu Hongsheng, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Match Industry Federation of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>▲ Notice from the Match Industry Federation to All Members: To our members, This Federation has repeatedly received letters from the Guangdong 土造 (domestic) Match Trade Business Association stating that, according to reports in the province and Hong Kong, the Swedish merchant Rui Zhong Match Company has made a loan to our country with the condition that Swedish matches have a patent in China for several years, etc. Match merchants are extremely fearful and request an investigation and reply to dispel public doubts, etc., and have attached a draft to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Furthermore, we have received a letter from the Three Eastern Provinces Match Industry Federation stating that, according to Japanese match merchants, they have heard that</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>the Consul stationed in Shanghai of that country claimed that the Ministry of Finance of our government has a loan agreement with the Swedish Match Company, tacitly agreeing to various rights. Please investigate whether this is true and inform us, etc. Based on this, this Federation has been paying attention to rumors of negotiations between Swedish merchants and the government regarding loans since June of this year. After repeated investigations, we have learned that this rumor has not become a reality. However, rumors are rife, and if there is no definite statement from the government, it is feared that all members will inevitably have doubts. Therefore, this Federation has submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce based on the facts, requesting a clear reply. Once instructions are received, we will notify you again. We have separately copied and attached the drafts of this Federation and the Guangdong 土造 (domestic) Match Trade Business Association, and we hope that you will take note.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Memorial Week of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Rectification Committee <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ Ye Chucang Reports on Three Major Problems in Jiangsu Province's Politics</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Party Rectification Committee held a memorial week for the Premier at 9 a.m. on the 13th in the committee's auditorium. Those present included Ye Chucang, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, rectification committee members Qi Xizeng, Huang Yuren, Ma Yinbing, as well as guests and more than a hundred staff members. After Chairman Qi Xizeng performed the ceremony, the Chairman introduced Ye Chucang to report on three major problems in Jiangsu Province's politics, followed by Qi Xizeng's report on the importance of the Fourth Plenary Session and the National Assembly. The ceremony concluded and those present departed. The following is Ye Chucang's report: In last week's newspaper, I saw Chairman Jiang's letter to the compatriots of the country, which briefly stated that the five points that our compatriots feel are most urgent and that the country actually needs are: (1) to eliminate 共匪 (communist bandits), (2) to reorganize finances, (3) to purify officialdom, (4) to develop the economy, and (5) to implement local autonomy. Although this text was published by Comrade Jiang personally, it is nothing more than the aforementioned points that the Central Government will express, decide, and strive for in the future. Therefore, these points can also be said to be the natural and righteous propositions of our party. Moreover, these points are not to be started from now on, nor are they the propositions of today. In fact, they have already been done but not done well, or only part of them has been done. The reason why Chairman Jiang wants to reiterate them today is because they were not completely done in the past, and it is to remind everyone to be aware that they were not completely done before and must continue to work hard in the future. The above five points are the guidelines for our party's governance in the future. On the one hand, we ask for these five points as a standard to examine the weaknesses of the past, and on the other hand, we must base on these five points to strive for a refreshed political indicator for the future. Now I would like to give a concrete report on the politics of this province within the scope of these five points:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the elimination of 共匪 (communist bandits) in this province, the 共匪 (communist bandits) in this province have been severely suppressed, the bandit forces have been slightly weakened, and the 共祸 (communist scourge) has gradually disappeared. There is still hope for future elimination. However, in the past, in the suppression of 共匪 (communist bandits), there were inevitably some mistakes, that is, the power of the people was not used to eliminate 共匪 (communist bandits). Only recently in the north and south of the Yangtze River have there been organizations for people's self-defense. Because the strength of this province is only four regiments of security teams, totaling about 6,000 people (only two regiments are currently available, with this force of more than 6,000 people being distributed among 61 counties, both in terms of strength and number being thin and small), it is necessary to rely on the national army for assistance. Recently, when I met Chairman Jiang in the Central Government, I was graciously promised that several divisions of troops could be transferred to Jiangsu and Zhejiang to assist in suppressing 共匪 (communist bandits). Therefore, there are methods and assurances regarding the future elimination of 共匪 (communist bandits). However, it should be known that although the national army can be temporarily transferred to suppress 共匪 (communist bandits), it cannot be regarded as a permanent force, because the national army has its own special mission. Local forces can only be transferred for a short time and only used to alleviate temporary emergencies. After the national army assists in the severe suppression, this province must still have considerable strength of its own. However, due to financial difficulties in this province, it is difficult to expand it for a while. Therefore, we have to pay attention to enhancing the people's self-defense capabilities. In the past, the government often failed to fully assist in the development of people's self-defense organizations, which was indeed a very big mistake. However, after the establishment of people's self-defense团 (corps) organizations, another problem arises, that is, whether this kind of people's self-defense strength can permanently become the strength of the people, and whether it will not become the strength of bandits or be used by others. This is a very important issue. In the past, the district administrations in many districts of this province had no achievements, and the district offices were just a nominal place. The ability of the district chiefs was not enough to do good, nor was it enough to do evil. If the 自卫团 (self-defense corps) are placed under the jurisdiction of the district chiefs in the future, then what will be the result of giving power to district chiefs who have no ability? Perhaps it will become a tool for bad people to do evil. If so, this kind of people's self-defense organization will once again become a non-people's force. Of course, this is a pathological symptom. We should not abandon a certain system because it may cause a certain pathological symptom and become a disadvantage of giving up eating because of choking. Therefore, we must find ways to remedy this shortcoming and strive to cultivate a genuine strength of the people in order to completely eliminate the poisonous scourge of the Communist Party among the people. This is the problem of eliminating 共匪 (communist bandits) in this province that still needs to be worked on.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the reorganization of the finances of this province, the finances of Jiangsu are now better than before. However, it is still felt to be tight, but it is not very chaotic, because there is a considerable budget this year. Although this budget may not be perfect, it is still more organized than in the past. However, although the situation in the province is like this, the counties are still unable to follow suit. Let us take the 田賦 (land tax) as an example. The annual income from 田賦 (land tax) in Jiangsu is about more than 10 million yuan. According to the actual number of 田畝 (fields) in the province, each 畝 (mu) only needs to pay 1 jiao (dime) of silver per year. In fact, the people pay ten times this amount, with a difference of 90%. This difference is caused by the abuses of 田賦 (land tax). Of course, we know that there are abuses and we should reorganize them, but among them there are also problems that are not easy to solve. Let's take one thing as an example. Recently, a 田賦 (land tax) abuse has been found in a certain county. This abuse is only one end of an affair that has been found in a certain case. The provincial government has temporarily sealed up the list of 田賦 (land tax) in that county for one year, and then proceeded to investigate. This case will certainly be clarified in the future, but because the 田賦 (land tax) list has been sealed up, it will be impossible to collect the 忙漕 (busy season tax), and the government's income will be temporarily suspended. Therefore, it is felt that in order to thoroughly reorganize the 田賦 (land tax), two conditions must be met: first, there must be honest talents who can reorganize the finances; second, there must be money prepared to alleviate the poverty during the reorganization period, and then the reorganization can be carried out effectively. If these two conditions cannot be met, then there is no point in talking about reorganization. Moreover, the government now has to rely on 田賦 (land tax) income every day to maintain itself. Therefore, we must have the determination to sacrifice on the one hand, and on the other hand, we must raise money, otherwise there will be no way. Now the colleagues in the provincial government feel this kind of pain. This is the problem of reorganizing the finances of this province that should be continued.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding the purification of officialdom in this province, today's officialdom has indeed reached a point where there are methods of governance but no people to govern. Take the organization of the People's Self-Defense團 (corps) as an example. Because 共匪 (communist bandits) are rampant, the people petition the government to organize the 自卫团 (self-defense corps). The government, in view of this matter, ordered to allow it. Later, because the people had no funds to organize the 自卫团 (self-defense corps), they collectively petitioned to hold a保卫捐 (defense donation). The government, in view of this move as necessary, then clearly ordered to allow it. Unexpectedly, as soon as this method was implemented, the organizers immediately abused their power for personal gain, took the opportunity to fish for profit, forcibly donated, extorted, and imposed harsh levies, resulting in all kinds of abuses and public complaints. The government knew that this method was inappropriate and tried to remedy it, and then clearly ordered that any held 保卫捐 (defense donation) must not be approved by the provincial government, and a supervisor must be sent by the province to supervise it. This method seems to have been properly implemented, but if the supervisors are in collusion and collude to commit fraud, then wouldn't it be like adding a guarantee to the extortionists? Therefore, I feel that even if there is a method to purify officialdom, it is futile if there is no one to purify officialdom. For example, the regulations for the assessment of county and bureau chiefs are indeed the best method for purifying officialdom, but in fact, it is not entirely so. Such punishments as demerits, salary deductions, and dismissals may be useful for relatively good people, but it is difficult to be effective for ordinary cunning people. For example, the county chief stipulates that nine minor demerits must be dismissed. Cunning people think that it is okay to record up to eight minor demerits. As long as they don't reach the ninth minor demerit. There is an even worse kind of people who think that if nine minor demerits must be dismissed, then when they reach the ninth time, they might as well do something bad and record a major demerit, preparing to be dismissed. If this is the case, then the law of officialdom is incurable. Therefore, I feel that the fundamental way to sum up is to cultivate more people with integrity. I once said to my comrades in the Central Government that the party in the future should take on the responsibility of education. If the party and education are separated, then the social atmosphere and the morality of the nation will have no way to revive. Although today's education is said to be 党化 (party-ized) education, it is actually just a facade and cannot be called "化" (transformation). It only has the surface of the party. The so-called true 党化 (party-ized) education must use the party as the center and the doctrine as the center to enrich the content of education. Therefore, I advocate that the organization of education can be integrated with the organization of the party. The implementation of all education must be centered on the party and the doctrine. A party education must be created, and party work must also have the mission of education. Then the old and bad environment can be transformed, and new and sound talents can be created.</p>

<p>North Wangting Bandits Seek Revenge: North Wangting Town, located at the junction of Suzhou and Wuxi, was suddenly attacked by sixty to seventy salt smugglers armed with rifles, box cannons, and other weapons at around 9 p.m. the night before last. Upon arriving at the town, they immediately opened fire as a show of force, surrounding the anti-smuggling team stationed inside the Yichang Cocoon Company from all sides and unleashing a barrage of gunfire. They looted extensively, stealing all the boxes, quilts, and other belongings of the anti-smuggling team members. They also burned a patrol boat and wounded a team member named Feng Youming. Upon hearing the alarm, Tan Shuren, the No. 2 patrol officer of the No. 6 team of the Second District of the water police stationed in the town, and Yang Songting, the No. 6 patrol officer, immediately led the police officers to suppress the bandits. After a fierce battle lasting half an hour, the bandits, unable to withstand the pressure, fled into Taihu Lake. It is said that the salt smugglers raided the town to avenge the deceased bandit leader Zhang Xiaoxiansheng. When the two sides exchanged fire, the smugglers shouted to the water police officers, "We are here specifically to make trouble for the anti-smuggling team and vent our past humiliation. This has nothing to do with you water police." The wounded team member Feng Youming was sent to the hospital for treatment yesterday.</p>
<p>The Tricycle Bureau Accused of Illegal Driving: The four steamship companies in this county, including Zhaoshang, Zhonghua, Xinshang, and Yonggu, recently accused the Yangxian Steamship Company of illegally operating steamships on the Zhangzhu line using a license belonging to the Jiangyin Yuxin Company, owned by Zhu Qian Shou. Yesterday, they specifically filed a petition with the county government, requesting a swift ban and requesting the ministry to revoke the license in order to uphold the law. Furthermore, the Xinan Public Steamship Bureau, which operates between Wuxi and Nanfangquan, accused the two steamship companies, Nandatongda, operating on the same route, of deliberately disobeying regulations. First, they disobeyed orders by adding late-night shifts, and then they arbitrarily lowered prices and solicited passengers everywhere, disrupting operations. Yesterday, the steamship bureau's representatives, Lu Shiquan and Wang Mingqing, jointly filed a petition with the county, requesting that the managers of the Nandatongda companies, Xiao Zhongquan and Yin Jianqing, be summoned and severely punished.</p>
<p>Theft Alarm at Dongba Bridge: In recent times, bandits have become so prevalent in the rural areas of Wuxi that they are almost everywhere. The family of Pu Ronglin, a resident of Dongba Bridge in the eastern part of Bashi Bridge in the Sixth District (Tianxia City), was suddenly attacked by five or six bandits at 3 a.m. the night before last. They broke into the house, first tying up and beating the entire Pu family, and then arbitrarily looting. They stole 100 yuan in banknotes and 50 silver dollars. After obtaining their loot, the bandits left with a shout. Yesterday morning, Jiang Jinhe, a farmhand of the Jiang family, spotted a bandit eating breakfast in a dim sum shop in Bashi Bridge Town. He immediately reported it to Gu, a special agent of the No. 1 team of the Second Squad of the town's police brigade, who led the police to capture him. Upon interrogation, the bandit confessed that his name was Wu Shigen, from Wu Lane in the Seventh District, and that he was 35 years old. He confessed to committing the crime at Ba Bridge last night and receiving seven silver dollars from the loot. According to the confession, Gu immediately escorted him to the county government for interrogation and handling.</p>

<p>The Business Community Does Not Agree to Increase Telephone Fees: The Ministry of Communications previously ordered the Zhenjiang Telephone Bureau to increase prices by one yuan starting in September. The business community unanimously rejected this and repeatedly telegraphed the ministry, requesting that the original prices be maintained and the increase be postponed until the Zhenjiang telephone system was reformed. Recently, the Ministry of Communications ordered the Zhenjiang Bureau to insist on collecting the new increased price starting in September. The Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting of its executive committee to report the full text of the ministry's order. After discussion, it was decided to telegraph the ministry again, requesting consideration of the difficulties faced by businesses, and to send a circular to all trade associations and shops, instructing them to pay according to the original prices in accordance with the resolution. If anyone paid the new increased price before being notified to do so, they would be held responsible for the losses suffered by all the merchants in the town.</p>

<p>Cui Shouzhi Buried in a Bandit's Den: The Deer River Town, located at the junction of Changshu and Taicang, was robbed by bandits last month, and Cui Shouzhi and eight others from the Yiheng Rice Shop were kidnapped, with a ransom of 180,000 silver dollars demanded. It is learned that the families were unable to pay the exorbitant ransom, so negotiations have been delayed for more than a month without reaching an agreement. It is now reported that Cui Shouzhi, who was kidnapped, was over 70 years old. On the night of the kidnapping, Cui was lying in bed wearing only a thin shirt and pants. The bandits seized him and dragged him away without allowing him to put on any clothes. He was dragged and pulled for several miles. Cui, being frail and old, was subjected to this cold and shock, and after arriving at the bandit's den, he fell ill and was unable to receive medical treatment, dying within a few days. The family was unaware of this. The other day, a private salt merchant arrived in town and reported to his family that Cui Shouzhi had died of illness. The Cui family was extremely alarmed and immediately sent someone to inquire. They met with the bandit leader and requested that the body be returned. However, the bandit leader said that there were many corpses here. If they wanted to see the body, they had to pay a viewing fee of ten silver dollars first. After identification, they would have to pay another 190 silver dollars (totaling 200 yuan) before they could take the body away. If they could not identify it, the viewing fee of ten yuan would be returned. The negotiator agreed and paid ten silver dollars. Then, he was led by several bandits to view the body. The body did not smell of decay, but the flesh was slightly withered. It was said that after each hostage died, they would be salted to preserve it for the family to claim. Now that it had been identified, the money could be paid to claim it. The negotiator returned to town and described what happened. Then, he took 190 silver dollars and went to claim the body, which was finally placed in a coffin and buried the day before yesterday. The remaining hostages have not yet been redeemed because the ransom has not been agreed upon, and they are still in danger.</p>
<p>Exposure of Fund-Raising Under False Pretenses: In the upper ten days of this month, someone calling himself Hu Guojun came to Changshu, acting quite extravagantly. After arriving in Changshu, he went to the county government to meet with County Magistrate Tan, carrying a letter from the Ministry of Interior, which stated that they were raising funds in various places for a blind, deaf, paralyzed, and disabled persons' home being established in the capital, due to a lack of funds. He requested protection from military and police along the way. At the time, County Magistrate Tan did not pay much attention and introduced him to the First District Office for assistance. He then raised 38 silver dollars. Hu then went to the Chamber of Commerce to meet with Chairman Xu Jingxi, intending to solicit donations from various businesses. Xu, suspicious of this sudden arrival and lack of official announcement, went to consult with the county magistrate, which aroused suspicion. That winter, he telegraphed the Ministry of Interior to inquire whether they had sent anyone to Changshu to raise funds. On the 13th, he received a reply stating that they had not sent anyone to Changshu and that there was no organization for a disabled persons' home in Beijing, indicating that it was a clear case of impersonation. The reply stated that they could be arrested and prosecuted. After receiving this letter, they searched everywhere for Hu Guojun, but he had disappeared without a trace.</p>

<p>Incidents of Robbery Recorded Together: Shagou Town, under the jurisdiction of Yancheng County, was previously burned and looted by bandits, resulting in losses of more than 200,000 yuan. Less than two months later, on the early morning of the day before yesterday, more than 300 bandit ships carrying more than 2,000 bandits, each armed with guns, arrived again. After mooring, they went ashore one after another, searching and looting every household. They also burned down more than ten shops and more than twenty civilian houses. They abducted more than 100 men and women as hostages and shot several townspeople. They did not leave Shagou until the next morning, entrenching themselves in Wangjia Village nearby. After receiving the news, County Magistrate Wang of this county ordered Police Brigade Commander Mu Shi Du to lead a team to join forces with the military and police of Yantai and Baoying counties to encircle and suppress the bandits. Furthermore, in Xinsha, the Sixth District of the county, more than ten bandits suddenly arrived at around 8 p.m. the night before last, each armed with guns, and searched and looted every household, with no one spared. It is said that the losses were enormous. Furthermore, Quan Yuliang, a wealthy resident of Shaguan Village in the county, was kidnapped by bandits previously. Due to the exorbitant ransom demanded, he has not yet been redeemed. The night before last, more than ten bandits arrived again, each armed with guns, and broke open the main gate of the Quan family. They entered and looted everything, and they also captured Quan Yuliang's cousin, Quan Yu Bao, instructing him to quickly prepare 50,000 yuan to redeem Quan Yuliang. After Yu Bao's repeated negotiations, it was agreed that they would pay 2,700 yuan before the bandits left with a shout.</p>

<p>Local Groups Oppose the New County Magistrate: The Dingyuan County Chamber of Commerce, Finance Management Office, Education Bureau, and district chiefs of all twenty districts in the county, Zhou Huantong, and others, telegraphed the chairman and civil affairs director of the Anqing Provincial Government, stating that since County Magistrate Xu took office in Dingyuan, he had worked diligently to govern the county, eliminated violence, and brought peace to the people, who relied on him for tranquility. They later heard that the provincial government had issued an order to appoint Li Wanshi as acting county magistrate of Dingyuan. They were just about to telegraph to request that the order be withdrawn when rumors spread that there was news of Fang Shaozhou being appointed instead. Upon hearing this, they were deeply fearful. It was discovered that in the autumn of 1927, Fang Shaozhou, using the name of the 33rd Army's Special Operations Team, entrenched himself within the county seat and surrounding areas, kidnapping people from every household, extorting police firearms, seizing educational land and public funds, and extorting more than 100,000 yuan. His actions were similar to those of bandits. They implored the provincial government to consider the people's concerns and immediately withdraw the order, preventing Fang from coming to Dingyuan, and also to telegraph County Magistrate Xu, instructing him to remain in his post with peace of mind in order to maintain local stability.</p>

<p>Banditry Rampant in Wuyuan's Border Areas: Wuyuan County is located near the Jiangxi border, and banditry has been rampant recently. Unemployed coal miners from Hubei and Jiangxi, as well as local bandits from Lede, are also constantly stirring up trouble. The other day, bandits from Leping invaded Kengtou, a village in the northern part of the county, and looted extensively. All 300 households in the village were affected, with losses estimated at more than 30,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, more than twenty kiln workers from nearby Yaopeng, armed with knives and guns, went to Shuanglukou, a village in the northern part of the county, to rob. Fortunately, the area was close to the two large villages of Fengshan and Hongguan, and the bandits, being few in number, did not dare to invade other villages. They only went to Defeng Fabric Shop and looted more than 1,000 yuan. At the time, Fengshan heard the alarm and quickly summoned hunters to track and pursue the bandits. Four bandit leaders were captured and have been sent to the county government today for investigation.</p>

<p>▲President Zheng is willing to overcome difficulties during the celebration</p>
<p>▲To create the highest overseas Chinese institution of the Three People's Principles</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese students from various provinces and cities at the National Jinan University held a meeting at Zhiyuan Hall at the school yesterday afternoon at 1:30 p.m. to celebrate Zheng Hongnian's appointment as the full-time president of the school. More than 1,000 people attended. The Jinan University Alumni Association in the capital and Shanghai sent representatives to congratulate him. The venue was decorated with a large banner celebrating Zheng's appointment, making it a grand occasion. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, Chairman Fu Ruiwu delivered the opening speech, stating that President Zheng bears the responsibility of creating and completing the school. This time, he resigned from industrial and political affairs, purely based on his original aspiration 23 years ago and his enthusiasm for caring for overseas Chinese children. Today, students from various provinces and cities are holding this grand meeting. In addition to their inner gratitude, they hope that President Zheng will continue to develop the school with his spirit of enduring hardship. Kang Laiwen and Wang Weiyin, representatives of the Jinan University Alumni Association in the capital and Shanghai, successively delivered congratulatory speeches. Mr. Zheng stood up and said that he was very gratified that everyone had come to celebrate his appointment as president. Since leaving the school, he had been in politics for many years and believed that all social undertakings must start with education. He felt that he had made no contribution to transportation in the past. All contributions were in education. In the ninth year of the Republic, he started vocational education on the railway, planting the seeds of labor education. He only sought to be beneficial to society and the country and to have a clear conscience, without liking publicity or seeking recognition. He maintained a skeptical attitude everywhere and studied with an open mind. "Overseas Chinese education" was created by him, and at first, it was not noticed by others. Because education should be done for education's sake, it should not be used for political activities, and young people should not be used as tools. This is the purpose of his education. He has said this repeatedly since he became the principal of this school. He is willing to be an educator for life. He is grateful for everyone's celebration and hopes that he can fully develop as the president. No matter how difficult it is in the future, he will continue to enrich the content and actively expand. He only hopes that the students will understand the purpose of his overseas Chinese education, which is to restore the national spirit, to repay the overseas Chinese for their contribution to the revolution, and to educate their children for the prime minister to thank the overseas Chinese elders. Therefore, he hopes that everyone will implement the Prime Minister's instructions, believe in the Three People's Principles. He personally does not need to be supported, what he wants to support is the Prime Minister's instructions, the Three People's Principles. Therefore, he hopes that everyone will work together to complete the highest overseas Chinese institution of the Three People's Principles. Then, Vice President Hong Qiling said that President Zheng is like a loving mother, and everyone is a good child. He is one of the nannies and hopes to keep today's deep impression forever. His words were very humorous and sincere. Then, Xu Kecheng talked about the indelible glorious history of overseas Chinese supporting the revolution. Then, the Western orchestra played several songs and served refreshments, ending with joy. Furthermore, the school held a school affairs meeting at Huaan Building at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, passing many important cases for improvement, which did not end until late at night.</p>

<p>Japanese residents in Shanghai discussed establishing a secondary school for boys in Shanghai in May. On the 13th of this month, the residents' meeting proposed the establishment of a commercial school. After discussion by the Japanese residents present, it was unanimously approved.

The school will be located in the Japanese Higher Elementary School on North Sichuan Road. It is reported that the school will have a five-year course, and the curriculum will take into account both employment in business and further education after graduation. The budget is estimated at 17,640 yuan for the first year, 25,150 yuan for the second year, 33,890 yuan for the third year, 43,680 yuan for the fourth year, and 53,580 yuan for the fifth year.

<p>▲ Result: 29 to 14</p>
<p>The Chi Chih and Tongji University basketball teams played a friendly match at the China Basketball Hall at 7:15 PM last night. Chi Chih won with a score of 29 to 14. The referee was Qu Hongren. The performance of both teams was not very impressive, probably due to their unfamiliarity with the techniques and disorganized formations. The score in the first half was quite close. Tongji scored first with one point. Then, Chi Chih had four or five free throw opportunities, but none of them were successful. After a long period of competition, Tongji added two more points, winning with a score of 3 to 0. From then on, Chi Chih's spirit suddenly rose, and their score increased steadily, while Tongji fell behind. At the end of the first half, Chi Chih had ten points and Tongji had eight points.</p>
<p>Starting in the second half, Tongji's fighting spirit slightly declined, while Chi Chih continued to fight hard. Yang Yulin and Wei Haiqing scored repeatedly, and the score jumped to 25 to 20. Tongji was difficult to move under Chi Chih's close supervision. As a result of the match, Chi Chih won with a score of 29 to 14.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Protest Against the Xingguang vs. Baota Match <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the Xingguang Sports Association, the Xingguang football team played against Baota in the first division championship at the China Baseball Field last week. The match was originally scheduled to start at 3:00 PM, but the referee had not arrived by 3:15 PM. The captain of the Xingguang team inquired with Zhou Jiaqi of the Progressive Association, who said that he had not received any notice from the Westerners. Therefore, the Progressive Association appointed Shen Huichun as the referee, and the match started at 3:20 PM. In the first half, both sides played tight offense and defense, and neither scored. After the break, the match continued. After about 38 minutes of play, the referee blew his whistle and said that a Xingguang player had committed a foul and awarded a penalty kick. Fortunately, the goalkeeper caught the ball and kicked it out. Not a minute later, a Baota player committed the same foul, and the referee also awarded a penalty kick. Unexpectedly, the Baota linesman made rude remarks, entered the field to interfere, and resisted the referee, not allowing the penalty kick to be taken. After the referee warned him, he finally retreated, but he was still not convinced. In the last five minutes, the linesman took the opportunity to wave the flag arbitrarily. The referee immediately asked him why, and the linesman said that the Xingguang goalkeeper had taken seven steps, forcing the referee to award a free kick, resulting in a score of 1 to 1. However, Xingguang's morale was greatly affected by the unwarranted accusation, and the players were unwilling to attack or defend. In the last two minutes, they lost the game. The Xingguang Sports Association believes that the Baota linesman arbitrarily disrupted the game and caused the referee to be unable to perform his duties, so the result should not be considered valid. It is said that they have filed a protest with the Westerners Association yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Chinese Women's Sports <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>By Chen Zhang'e, Director of the Physical Education Department of Jinan University (1)</p>
<p>The author has lived in Southeast Asia for a long time and is not familiar with the sports situation in China. In addition, my knowledge is limited, so I dare not discuss sports. Now, in response to the invitation of the Shenbao editor, I will simply raise a question, and this question is "Chinese Women's Sports." This issue of Chinese women's sports was also promoted many times during my lectures in Guangzhou last summer, but there was no complete publication. Now I can tell you everything. Everyone knows that women's sports is an important issue. In the past, we didn't understand or talk about sports at all, which led to China's decline. Now it's better. You see, in recent years, whether it is schools, groups, or families, they all pay attention to sports. However, no one in the women's sector has come out to promote it, which is a kind of regret. We know that there are 400 million people in China, half men and half women. Among them, 200 million are men, and 200 million are women. Men should pay attention to sports, and women should pay even more attention. They should pay more attention than men, because today's women are the mothers of the country in the future. If today's women are not healthy, their bodies will not be strong when they grow up in the future. Then the little citizens they pass down in the future will also become weak. It can be seen that today's women have a great relationship with the strength of our nation. Now, let's first discuss a small question with all the readers. This is something that is necessary for life. What do you think this is? This is something that we cannot leave for a moment, and that is air. If we don't have air in a few minutes, we cannot live. If we don't have water or rice, we will die in seven or eight days or dozens of days. If we don't have sunlight or if we work all day long without a moment's rest, we will not be able to survive for a long time. However, if we have all of the above needs, can we live? I'm afraid we still can't. For example, if there is a person now, we give him fresh air and plenty of sunlight every day, and we also give him plenty of food and drink, and we also tell him to rest every day, don't let him run, and don't let him walk. Just sit still all day long. What do you think will happen to this person? We can be sure that he will die in three or four months. Everyone can understand this point, so we can know that exercise is a very important thing in life. You see, when people are first born, they fall to the ground with a "gua gua" sound, waving their hands and kicking their feet. This is the first exercise in life. The term exercise can also be called physical education. Now I want to talk about the importance of physical education and its meaning. Modern educators all acknowledge that it (physical education) is an important science in education and the foundation for creating a complete personality. All readers should know that physical education is the most important of all educations. Physical education is the foundation for creating a personality. What does it mean to be the foundation of a personality? For example, if we want to build a building, the construction of this building should have five major elements. The first point is magnificence. It must be able to make everyone praise it. It must be magnificent and grand, so if our building is magnificent, people will unanimously praise it. The second is layout. Our building is able to achieve the purpose of magnificence because the host has artistic knowledge and careful research. The third is planning. Planning is extremely important. Before we build a building, we must first have engineers discuss the specific plan before it meets the principles of architecture. The fourth is raw materials. If our building has a specific plan, the layout is neat, and the appearance is magnificent, but the raw materials are not good, the wood is old, the iron is rusty, and the bricks, stones, sand, and soil are not strong, the house built in this way will not last long. Therefore, raw materials are also an element of construction. The fifth is the foundation. This issue is very important. If the elements of this building are good, the planning, layout, and magnificence are all pleasing, but the foundation is not good or it is built on loose sand or on a sandy slope, wouldn't it be very dangerous once the wind rises and the tide comes? Therefore, a solid foundation is the most important issue in building a building. We want to cultivate children so that they become healthy people, and it is almost the same as this construction method. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e102">Zhang Qun and Fang Benren Arrived in Shanghai Together Yesterday <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>▲ Scheduled to go to Nanjing today to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and report</p>
<p>▲ Should strive to develop construction projects hereafter</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Zhang Qun, who was previously ordered by the Central Government to go to Liaoning for negotiations, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM after being away for three months. Mr. Zhang, accompanied by Fang Benren, the Central Government representative stationed in Liaoning, arrived by the Dalian Maru and disembarked at the Huangpu Wharf. Prior to this, the Garrison Headquarters and the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team had provided strict security around the wharf. Those who went to welcome him were very enthusiastic, including Yu Hongjun, Yin Rugeng, Liu Jiwen, and Xiong Shihui's representative Chen Yuxiang, Yuan Ludeng, Yan Shenyu, the Municipal Party Headquarters' Zhu Yingpeng, Fan Zhengbo, the Public Security Bureau Chief Yuan Liang, as well as the chiefs of various bureaus, counselors, section chiefs, and captains of the water patrol teams, totaling no less than a hundred people. At that time, it was raining heavily, and all the welcomers stood in the rain, complaining incessantly. Fortunately, after the Dalian Maru docked at the wharf, the rain eased slightly. Mr. Zhang disembarked first and greeted everyone individually. Fang Benren then also disembarked, and they all returned to their residences by car to rest.</p>
<p>▲ Planned Steps After disembarking, Mr. Zhang was approached by our newspaper reporter for an interview. Mr. Zhang first stated, "My trip to Liaoning was originally scheduled for three weeks, but unexpectedly, I stayed in Liaoning for as long as three months. The security of Shanghai City relies on the maintenance of Commander Xiong and the comrades of the Party Headquarters, as well as all sectors of society. It remains peaceful as always. This should be specially stated and thanked first. Furthermore, this time, Deputy Commander Zhang's telegram to send troops to take office, the manifestation of past facts, and the future measures have all been closely negotiated with the Central Government in advance. This is a kind of planned step. The rumors outside are absolutely unbelievable. It is even said that Deputy Commander Zhang has other views on the party and government, which is not worth a smile from those in the know. Deputy Commander Zhang extremely agrees with what Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said in his telegram: all subsequent dispositions will be completely in accordance with the Central Government. This should be stated second."</p>
<p>▲ Source of Rumors Mr. Zhang also said, "The source of rumors is Dalian and Tianjin in the north, and Shanghai and Hong Kong in the south. Shanghai is especially a concentrated area for various rumors. The public should pay special attention to it and not believe it lightly. After the national general mobilization, Yan and Feng have been defeated. The second step is the national general mobilization to work hard on construction projects. The responsibility for construction should be jointly borne by the government and the people. If we only blame the government, it is like planting trees: the government cultivates them, and the people discard them, then planting is the same as not planting. For example, the floods in western Liaoning were due to the efforts of all sectors of society in Shanghai to raise relief funds. The Northeast authorities are extremely grateful, and they attribute the cause of the floods in western Liaoning to the public's inability to properly manage the rivers, often padding the banks with soil to reduce the riverbed and increase planting, so that the rivers gradually narrowed. Once the water rises, it is inevitable that it will flood. Therefore, although the government dredges the rivers and diverts water, the public must also protect them well."</p>
<p>▲ Firmly Declines Concurrent Position Mr. Zhang expressed his firm refusal to take the position of Chairman of the China Merchants Bureau Reorganization Committee. He said, "With my personal talents, I already feel overwhelmed to take charge of Shanghai's municipal administration. Moreover, I have been running around for national affairs and have no time to spare. In this year alone, I have gone to Fujian and Liaoning in ten months, which has taken up half of my time. After this, I should urgently work hard to make up for the previous losses. How can I have the spare time to take care of other things? I hope my humble sincerity can be understood."</p>
<p>▲ Chiang-Zhang Meeting When asked if Deputy Commander Zhang plans to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently, he replied, "It has not been decided recently, but Zhang said before I left that he should come to Nanjing often in the future. Wu Tiecheng has gone to Tianjin to preside over the oath-taking ceremony for Wang Shuchang and Yu Xuezhong. Wang Jinyu will stay in Liaoning to negotiate. When Wu returns to his domain, Wang will go south. Deputy Commander Zhang recently expressed his opinion that the most important thing at present is to quell the chaos. After the chaos is quelled, he will devote all his efforts to construction. His true intentions can be seen in this." It is said that Mr. Zhang and Mr. Fang are scheduled to go to Nanjing today to meet with Chiang Kai-shek and report everything.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Large Batch of Japanese Sample Rice <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>▲ Arrived yesterday on a Japanese ship</p>
<p>▲ Rice industry announces boycott</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the Japanese government has commissioned Mitsui &amp; Co. to ship a large batch of Japanese rice to Shanghai for sale, which has become a fact. According to reliable information yesterday, the first batch of sample rice has already been shipped by Mitsui's Wakayama Maru and arrived in Japan yesterday morning. After import, it was berthed at Mitsui Wharf in Pudong. The total number of imports is estimated to be 18,300 stones. Although the Municipal Government's Social Bureau and other departments have paid attention to this matter, the central government has not yet issued an order to investigate and prohibit it, so it is too late to prohibit its import. The ship originally planned to import it in Hong Kong, but after learning that the customs had not yet taken action, it was shipped directly to Shanghai. The second batch is even larger and is planned to be shipped to Shanghai as quickly as possible before the prohibition order is issued. The planned number of 100,000 stones will be shipped in four batches. In addition, more than 100,000 stones have been shipped to Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Sun Zhentong respectfully informs rice merchants to boycott the shipment of Japanese rice to Shanghai for sale, saying, "The source of the revolution is due to the economic aggression of the great powers, which is becoming increasingly serious. The ancestral country is seeing its demise. The late Prime Minister said in his lectures on the Principle of People's Livelihood that China is a country established on agriculture, and food is the most important thing for the people. The entire life of farmers and citizens is the center of society, which has the ability to support the prosperity of urban economy and politics. The Prime Minister's last words still say that the evil forces have not been exhausted, and the aggression has not stopped. He exhorted future generations to continue to work hard to resist aggression in order to save the country from danger. Unexpectedly, in the eight years since then, only Saigon and Min Dang foreign rice were imported into China at first. In the most recent four years, there have been large and small shipments of wrapped rice. This year, there has been an increase in Burmese Kegan rice coming to China. How can our country bear the loss of foreign rice? I remember that a few years ago, more than a hundred rice merchants went bankrupt because of this, and their vitality was greatly lost. Japan, a country established on industry, can fill China with millions of agricultural products, silk cotton clothing materials, etc. In the past, Zhentong also found it difficult to describe them in detail. Now I see Japan shipping a large number of agricultural products, silk cotton, and cloth, which is fatal to our country's silk cotton and cloth merchants. In Shanghai and Wuxi alone, hundreds of silk factories and thousands of cloth factories have been closed, and hundreds of thousands of unemployed men and women workers are waiting to die with no way to maintain themselves. It is really heartbreaking to talk about this. I am saddened by the fact that unscrupulous merchants are greedy for huge profits, acting as accomplices and harming the country and the people. The dangerous situation is so great that it could erupt at any moment. Are my rice merchants aware of this? On October 10th, various newspapers reported that Japan was shipping millions of stones of toxic rice from stockpiles to China for trade, and the first batch will arrive in Shanghai. They are heavily bribing unscrupulous merchants and entrusting them with sales. Compatriots, this is not just the outflow of rights, but it is actually handing over a knife to kill people. The previous aggression was only against silk cotton cloth merchants and coolie workers, but now it is not only frustrating rice merchants, but also affecting tens of millions of farmers. Foreign insults are coming one after another, so that food and clothing are also controlled by others. After a few years, destruction can be expected. Those who have a little conscience are all terrified. Alas, my people, if we continue to endure without resisting, what consequences can we imagine? I hope that the wise men in charge will plan for mediation, strictly prohibit imports, and save a glimmer of hope. Zhentong cries out to my beloved rice merchant giants and patriotic gentlemen: Even if the Japanese in China do not eat Chinese rice, they must not be blinded by greed and lose all conscience, willingly acting as killing machines. I hope that the people of the country would rather starve to death than eat Japanese rice. I also hope that other foreign rice will be completely eliminated from our country as soon as possible. It is a matter of life and death, and you must not underestimate it. Industry and agricultural products are all under control. The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of everyone. Step by step, the danger is coming closer and closer. What I mean is dangerous, so I am giving you my sincere advice. I hope you will consider it carefully."</p>

<p>Mr. Nagai Ryutaro, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Japanese Hamaguchi Cabinet, came to our country under the order of his government to investigate politics.

In order to understand our party's policies and general attitude toward Japan, he specially requested Mr. Peng Chunshi to invite Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Wu Kaixian, Tong Hangbai, Fan Zhengbo, and other gentlemen from the Municipal Party Headquarters to have a conversation with each other in a private capacity. Mr. Nagai recounted the various policies of the Japanese Minseito toward our country, striving for friendship, and striving to correct the mistakes of the previous Seiyukai's aggression. His words were very long. Mr. Pan Gongzhan of the Municipal Party Headquarters replied on behalf of the party, which was particularly meticulous and brilliant. During the meeting, Mr. Peng also invited Tang Feiyu, Li Dezhao, Ding Mocun, and Japanese people such as Yamamoto Eiji and Hata Hiroshi, who all gave speeches.

He went to the garden to take dozens of feet of various Chinese buildings and asked the owner of the garden, Mr. Chen Xuejia, to take him in for commemoration. During the meeting, Mr. Fu Xiteng, who speaks Siamese at Jinan University, was invited to serve as a translator. Mr. Bai was also able to speak fluent English and simple Cantonese, so he was able to deal with everyone one by one, and his interest was very high.

<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, who went to Nanjing the day before yesterday to discuss the issue of shipping industry public bonds, returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Mr. Yu's words to a New Sound News Agency reporter, he paid a visit to Chairman Chiang at the National Government at 10:00 AM on the 13th after arriving in Nanjing. They talked for an hour. Afterwards, he dined with Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, and Cai Yuanpei at Chiang's residence, chatting for about two more hours. Mr. Yu said that after the military operations concluded, there must be a period of recuperation and rehabilitation.

As for the shipping industry public bonds, negotiations are already underway.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Nature of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Will Be Determined at the Fourth Plenary Session <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>▲ Song Shuqiao Reported at the Memorial Week Ceremony</p>
<p>Since the National Government announced the appointment of Li Zhonggong as the Chairman and General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the various initiatives have been full of vitality and have been highly valued by all parties. Recently, during the autumn festival according to the lunar calendar, many considered it a difficult time. Mr. Li has calmly dealt with it. The remaining scattered debts are also being repaid gradually. In terms of personnel, he focuses on employing people based on their talents. In terms of finance, he strives to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The issue of the nature of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has always been a central point of contention. On National Day, Mr. Li drafted an article entitled "Fundamental Issues in Reorganizing the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company," which also expressed a very clear position. Mr. Li went to Nanjing the day before yesterday. It is said that he will present to the National Government and Chairman Chiang on the recent situation and fundamental issues of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and also intends to propose a fundamental reform plan. Also, at the Memorial Week ceremony the day before yesterday, the Secretary-General of the Bureau, Song Shuqiao, reported on behalf of the chairman, also explaining the nature of the Bureau. The general idea was that with the Fourth Plenary Session about to convene, the National Government's political construction would better satisfy the demands of the general public. Regarding the Bureau, in my opinion, the main reason for the decline of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company lies in "illness" rather than "poverty." The reason why the Bureau is poor is due to many malpractices. Saving the poor without eliminating the malpractices will not change its poverty. If the accumulated malpractices can be eliminated, it is not difficult to reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which has assets worth 40 million and debts of only 13 million. However, since the fundamental nature has not yet been determined, there are bound to be some difficulties. This time, General Manager Li went to Nanjing to report on the work progress and will also present to the National Government and Chairman Chiang on the nature of the Bureau, and intends to request the Fourth Central Plenary Session to discuss and resolve the matter decisively. As for the Bureau's appointment, dismissal, and treatment of staff, and its security system, it has never been perfect. In the future reorganization, we should follow the established rules of the Post Office, and adopt examination methods or other screening methods for employing people, and select true talents with a fixed legal system. For positions, we should find ways to ensure their stability, so that they can stay in their positions for a long time and perform their duties and abide by the law. Regarding remuneration, the principle of "generous salary to foster integrity" should be applied so that they can maintain their livelihood and not have the bad habit of taking improper gains. However, what needs to be noted is that the method must be strict; otherwise, if the salary is already generous but integrity is not fostered, then the Bureau staff will serve the public, not individuals, and will not panic because of changes in the head of the department. Further, the heads of such transportation agencies have administrative nature and are not purely political in nature, and their term of office should also be longer. The term of office of the President of Nippon Yusen Kaisha was also declared to be 15 years at the beginning of the government's trusteeship. In the future, if the nature of the Bureau can be decisively determined as state-owned, this system of protecting service personnel can be adopted, and the future will not be difficult to usher in a new era.</p>

<p>▲ Ministry of Communications Informs the Municipal Government to Order a Cease</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, based on Article 4 of the contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the China Foreign Company in the 14th year of the Republic of China, limited the water line to Pudong to a maximum of 75 pairs of core wires. Now, the company has arbitrarily laid new water lines, increasing to 150 pairs of core wires. It is difficult to guarantee that there are no other purposes. In addition to ordering the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to first prohibit the use of the extra 75 pairs of core wires in the laid water lines, it is also responsible for ordering the company to repair the old water lines or add a new water line with 75 pairs of core wires, and dismantle the currently laid 150 pairs of core wires to comply with the original plan. It also sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government, instructing the water and land public security agencies that if foreigners lay water and land electric lines in the Chinese concession in the future without the approval of the Ministry and notification on record, they should be strictly prohibited to prevent encroachment.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Special Circumstances in the Bean and Rice Industry <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>▲ Request to Modify the Year-End Account Settlement Date According to the National Calendar</p>
<p>Ye Huijun, a standing committee member of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, stating that it was a request to temporarily modify the account settlement with merchants according to the national calendar. He respectfully presented his views and requested instructions. Since the Republic of China, the solar calendar has been adopted, and merchants' accounts are settled at the end of May, the end of September, and the end of December, in three phases. The end of May is 26 days later than the 5th day of the 5th lunar month, and the end of September is one and a half months later than the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. Therefore, comparing the new and old calendars, there is no difference between the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival of the abolished lunar calendar. However, judging from the past experiences, various difficulties have already been felt. If the end of December is used, this year it will be the 12th day of the 11th lunar month, which cannot be postponed. It is about 50 days earlier than the abolished lunar calendar. During this transition period, it is extremely difficult, especially for our rice industry. Now, I will explain the commercial habits of our bean and rice industries to you, Sir. The transactions of the bean and rice industries, apart from cash transactions, have two types of account settlement: large and small month-end settlements and three-festival settlements. In this street, the scattered households and rural customers mostly settle their accounts at the three festivals. They cannot pay off the debts at the end of May and the end of September, and the year-end is often the time for total settlement. This has been a long-standing practice and has become an unchangeable fact. There are no less than 110 bean and rice companies in Shanghai, with monthly transactions of no less than seven or eight million yuan. Usually, funds are used for circulation, and they are collectively closed at the end of the period. Since the promulgation of the clear order to change to settling accounts according to the solar calendar, banks and money shops will inevitably urge for payment when the deadline arrives. However, our country is an agricultural country, and the harvest of agricultural products must be until mid to late November. Taking rice as an example, from doing rice (commonly known as "throwing rice") to drying rice, to grinding rice, to transporting and selling it in rural and urban areas, to reselling it in commercial ports, all kinds of procedures cannot be completed in one or two months. Our industry can start accumulating stocks between December and January of the solar calendar. If we settle accounts at the end of the solar calendar, when we need funds to purchase goods, we have to settle accounts with financial institutions. Funds are stagnant and cannot circulate, and commerce will stagnate. Our industry's annual plan lies in the winter. If we do not accumulate stocks at this time, we will have no goods to supply the market in the coming year. This is the first reason why it is not possible. Farmers rely on selling goods to get money, and they get money to repay debts. Rural stores also rely on the return of debts to settle their accounts. Our industry receives this account and then settles it with the silver and money industry. This has been a practice for thousands of years and cannot be changed due to seasonal restrictions. If we settle accounts at the end of the year, our industry will not be able to accumulate rice stocks. Rice merchants and farmers will not be able to obtain funds. Finance is like a tide, flowing from the sea to the river to the port and the ditch. If one way is blocked, hundreds of streams will not flow. Low grain prices are already hurting farmers, and grain stagnation will make farmers unable to survive. This is the second reason why it is not possible. Based on these two reasons, settling accounts at the end of the year actually has many difficulties. Therefore, the money industry associations of Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Wujin, and Danyang counties recently proposed to set the end of January each year as the closing date, which suggests a fiscal year. At the beginning of this year's preparations, the lower half of the month should be temporarily moved, that is, February 15 of the 20th year as the final closing date. The association believes that the situation of our rice industry is more special than other industries. As mentioned above, it is practically difficult to settle accounts at the end of the year. It is inevitable to request another method and make a special modification. Some may say that correcting the calendar is an important task for establishing a country, as recorded in historical records. Why should we be perfunctory? Moreover, is our country the only country in the world that is based on agriculture? They follow the solar calendar, and we have not heard of any difficulties. Why should we be so argumentative? The answer is that correcting the calendar is one thing, and settling accounts for merchants is another. The fiscal year may adopt March, July, or other months, depending on whether it is suitable for the country's conditions and whether it is in line with customs. Our country has been settling accounts according to the three festivals of the lunar calendar for thousands of years. It should be changed gradually. It seems that during the period of political tutelage, we should temporarily set the end of January of the following year as the closing date for the previous year. This year, we should especially extend it by 15 days. During these four or five years, we should try our best to implement it and gradually change the example of settling accounts by festivals to settling accounts annually, and then to settling accounts monthly. Perhaps the time is sufficient, and reform is not difficult. At that time, we will reconsider the situation and discuss it at length. If changing to settling accounts at the end of the year is not difficult, then we will follow the end of the year uniformly. Otherwise, we will set a separate fiscal year for commercial affairs to ensure that politics and commerce do not interfere with each other and instead help each other appropriately. Although the association is not involved in politics, it should be discussed from a practical point of view. In addition to sending separate letters to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Money Industry Association, I respectfully propose the following. I respectfully request your approval for implementation and instruct compliance for the benefit of the public. Respectfully submitted to Pan, Director of the Shanghai Social Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Export Freight for European Lake Silk Soars <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>▲ Unprecedented Export Silk Costs</p>
<p>The slump in the Chinese silk industry this year is unprecedented. The number of silk mills in Shanghai that have suspended operations has reached 106. The export volume of Chinese silk has also been affected. Recently, the number of silk shipments exported by British and French postal ships has sharply decreased. It is reported that there are only about 2,000 silk pieces stored in Shanghai. This situation is rare in recent years. However, British and French postal shipping companies have suddenly increased the export freight for Lake silk during this period of slump in the silk industry. The freight per piece has increased by a huge amount of several taels of silver per 112 pounds. The freight for transporting silk has always fluctuated by only two or three cents of silver per piece and has never increased so dramatically as it does now. It truly breaks the historical record for export silk freight. The freight for transporting silk from Shanghai to Europe was 14 taels, 9 mace, and 5 fen per piece in October of the year before last. It had risen to 17 taels by October of last year. Now, it has suddenly increased to 26 taels and 6 mace. The freight for yellow silk was only 11 taels and 6 mace on this day the year before last. Last year, it increased to 13 taels and 1 mace. This year, it has exceeded 20 taels, which is a huge price never seen before. The new prices are listed below, which are also closely related to the shipping industry.</p>

<h3 id="e121">Li Kebin Privately Detained His Wife <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>▲ She Was Rescued in a Near-Death State</p>
<p>▲ The Accumulation of Feces and Foul Odor</p>
<p>Is Li Tan's Mentally Ill?</p>
<p>Li Kebin, a native of Guangxi, resides at No. 826 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu. Between the 9th and 13th of this month, he inexplicably and secretly detained his wife, Li Tan, in the attic of the house, locking the door and depriving her of food and drink, intending to starve her to death. The second landlord, Zhang Jiaping, a native of Ningbo, advised Li in vain. He also did not understand the truth of what they did due to the language barrier. Fearing that she would starve to death inside without reporting it to the police, he could not shirk his responsibility as the landlord. However, Li insisted that it was okay, saying that his wife would definitely not die. Therefore, Zhang would hit her window with a wooden pole from the sun deck every morning and evening. When she heard the sound, she approached the window and asked Zhang to buy bread and boiled water to satisfy her hunger. At 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, a neighbor, Chinese Constable No. 2160 from Sandaotou, Yangshupu Police Station, met Zhang and learned of the matter. He reported it to the police station. The police chief sent Western Detective Mek accompanied to the address, opened the attic, and saw her lying in bed, in a near-death state and about to die. The room was full of feces and foul odor, which was unbearable. They immediately found a way to hire a car to take her to the hospital for treatment and detained Li Kebin in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. According to the police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, he stated the case and said that the police station accused the defendant of attempted murder under Article 282, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The victim, Li Tan, is a native of Guangxi and there is no one to translate today. Please postpone the case. Then, the Chinese Constable from Sandaotou and the Western Detective successively reported the situation at the time. Zhang Jiaping, the second landlord, also provided a testimony. Li Tan was able to say that she was 40 years old and made gestures with her hands. The rest of her words were unclear. When questioned, the defendant Li Kebin, speaking Cantonese, confessed that she had recently suffered a major episode of mental illness and insulted and beat people she met. Therefore, the nanny who had already returned to her hometown locked her in the room. He ordered people to give her food and drink through the side windows and did not intend to starve her to death. His concubine, Li Zhou, also stated that Tan had indeed suffered from her old illness, so the nanny locked her in the room and she sent her food and drink every day. Judge Ge Zhitan reviewed the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed for seven days. Li Tan should be sent to the hospital by the police station for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Yesterday's Continued Hearing of Zhang Nai's Bigamy Case <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yang Xuejiu Was Watched by the Crowd</p>
<p>▲ Zhang Nai's Whereabouts Are Also Unknown</p>
<p>▲ The Court Ordered Another Hearing Next Wednesday</p>
<p>The bigamy case of You Yaohao against Zhang Nai, etc., was continued yesterday at the Special District Court. The presiding judge was Cheng Shangfeng. After 1:00 PM, Criminal Court No. 2 was already full, with more men than women. Yang Xuejiu is the second defendant in the case and is also the main figure in the case. After several hearings, she has been called for many times. Apart from attending the second instance, she has not been present. Yesterday, she had to attend because the attorney, Jiang Yiping, had repeatedly asked her to do so. Yang's appearance is not bad, with willow eyebrows, almond eyes, snow-white skin, and a bridge on her nose, probably due to myopia. Her shiny hair was styled in a childish manner. She wore a coat and silk stockings with a cheongsam. After entering the court, attorney Jiang asked her to sit in the translator's seat. Later, because the seats were quite crowded, she got up and went to the reporter's seat and whispered to her younger sister. Her voice was very low, and no one could hear it. At this time, many of the onlookers knew that she was Yang Xuejiu, who had not attended several court sessions. Thus, she attracted much attention. After 2:00 PM, Judge Cheng took the stand, and You Yaohao walked to the plaintiff's column. Her mother sat next to her. The court also summoned Yang Xuejiu and Gong Yu to come forward. Yang Xuejiu's mother hired a lawyer to represent her, saying that Yang's mother had recently developed a tumor and could not attend the court. Judge Cheng also asked Yang Xuejiu where Zhang Nai was and asked if she had seen a quick letter that You Yaohao wrote to her mother on December 2nd of last year. After Yang read the letter, she said that she had not received it. On December 1st, she went to Beijing for business and returned after a week. Zhang Nai's whereabouts are also unknown. He also asked if she and Zhang Nai had a marriage certificate. She replied that because they were married in a church, they did not have a certificate. Judge Cheng then asked You Yaohao why the items in Gong Yu's possession had not been retrieved because there was no place to put them. The court pondered for a long time and then asked why the letter you posted at the Xujiahui branch on December 2nd of last year was stated to be sent on the 4th. You replied that he might have misremembered the date. At this point, the court ordered the case to be rescheduled for next Wednesday, ordering Zhang Nai to be arrested and summoning Pastor Yu to attend the court. Yang Xuejiu must pay additional bail. Yang looked displeased upon hearing the order. Attorney Jiang requested that the bail be waived, saying that his representative could be responsible for ensuring that Yang would be present at the next hearing. Judge Cheng then ordered that Yang pay a "ready to appear" bond.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Clear Cloud Lane Litigation Awaits Sentencing <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The landlord of houses near Clear Cloud Lane on North Szechuan Road, Chongming Road, the New Sassoon Company, previously instructed its Chinese manager, Xing Dingcheng, to force evictions, which were unsuccessful. On the tenth of last month, Xing led a group to forcibly demolish houses, damaging roofs, injuring people, and looting. Recently, the victims, the grocery store "Sen Tai Sheng" and another business, hired lawyers to sue Xing for destruction and assault in the Special District Local Court. Yesterday afternoon, the Second Criminal Court heard the case. The plaintiffs, Ye Chenglin and Miao Sheilai, appeared in court and recounted the events. Judge Cheng verified Xing Dingcheng's statement and ordered that the sentence be announced next Wednesday.</p>
<h3 id="e124">A Brief Biography of the Tragically Deceased Industrialist Xu Wenhuan <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The tragic death of Mr. Xu Wenhuan was reported yesterday. It is now known that Mr. Xu was the grandson of Mr. Xu Xuecun of Wuxi. During the Tongzhi and Guangxu eras of the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Xuecun translated books on chemistry and physics with Westerners, enlightening future generations and gaining renown at the time. His sons, Zhonghu and Zhusan, both carried on his work. The Xu family, father and sons, along with Mr. Hua Ruoting of the same county, were listed in the National History Museum's biographies, and the villagers respected them as the Four Sages of Wuxi. Wenhuan was born to Zhusan and received a strict education from his family, excelling in learning, especially in technology. For the past twenty years, he established the Gaoyi Company on Gaochang Temple Longhua Road, manufacturing electrical appliances and artificial ice, among other things. Merchants competed to buy them. He was diligent and thrifty, liked to supervise construction, and personally took charge of the work. On the thirteenth, while inspecting a motor, he accidentally severed his left arm and died before he could be saved. It is truly lamentable. It is recalled that Mr. Xu Zhonghu served as the superintendent of the Hanyang Arsenal during the late Qing Dynasty, manufacturing cotton gunpowder, and died in an explosion. Both a son and a grandson of Mr. Xuecun died because of learning, which can be said to be a great misfortune for Chinese entrepreneurs.</p>

They managed painstakingly and spared no effort. They issued 30,000 Good Fortune Tickets to solicit calligraphy and paintings as gifts. Among the gifts, the most notable was the six thousand bottles of 38-year-old Chen Jin Xing Brandy donated by the China Changyu Winery Company. The association members are willing to promote the company to make large sales as compensation. The association's relief work is now coming to an end, and the brandy is planned to be issued with gift certificates to be widely promoted. There will be four types of certificates, priced at 2 yuan, 4 yuan, 6 yuan and 8 yuan. A 2-yuan certificate can be redeemed for one bottle of brandy.

<h3 id="e127">Detailed Record of the Shareholders' Meeting of Dasheng Factories One, Two, and Three <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>▲ Factory One: The shareholders' meeting of Dasheng Factory One was held on the eleventh of this month at the Bank Association. Shareholders representing a total of 8,686 shares attended, and Mr. Li Qiqing was elected chairman. The formalities were performed as usual. Then, Chairman Zhang Xiaoshi reported on the progress of the factory. Supervisors Yun Jishen and Chen Zixiang reported on the accounts. Committee member Zhou Meiquan reported on the beginning and end of the committee's task. Next, several proposals were made. Shareholder Yang raised three questions: (1) Why has the shareholders' meeting been held only now after four years? (2) The formation of the maintenance association and its contract should be announced. (3) Although the business has made a profit, why is it not as good as other factories? The manager should be responsible for answering this question. The chairman said that the three matters that Shareholder Yang requested to be answered were all past events. Of course, there are facts. It is best to ask shareholders to save this precious time and pay more attention to future matters to seek benefits for the company. Wu Jiyun said, "I am responsible for the Shanghai office. I remember the past events in more detail. Today, I cannot help but answer a few words briefly to dispel the shareholders' doubts." (1) The board of directors has repeatedly proposed the shareholders' meeting, but there were unavoidable considerations. It was still for the sake of maintaining the company. Then, it was delayed due to handling registration procedures. As for the maintenance association contract and the new and old accounts of the syndicate, Director Zhang of the former Finance Department sent a supervisor to reside in the factory. Director Wang of the Construction Department also sent a section chief to the company for an investigation. Both departments have copies, and there are no secrets. As for the thin profits, Manager Li has already reported on it, but he is now recuperating at Mogan Mountain. I cannot give a detailed answer on the matters in the factory. Official shareholder representative Jin Baoguang said, "This time, the provincial government has appointed me and Cheng Baitang, Guan Ji'an, Shen Yanmou, and Chen Guangfu to be candidates for directors and supervisors on behalf of the official shares of the company. I am able to participate in today's shareholders' meeting and meet with all the shareholders. All the official documents of the provincial government have just been announced by the chairman. Since Dasheng was founded in the eleventh year of the Republic of China, there have been many problems that cannot be solved immediately. We can only hope that the reorganized board of directors, directors and supervisors, can all be the right people and work together to improve the company. The purpose of the provincial government's appointment of us and our future tasks for the company are all in this. There are many proposals listed on today's agenda, and some of them can be discussed by the new board of directors in the future in order to solve them. Those that must be discussed by the shareholders' meeting at present should be put forward for discussion immediately. After the discussion is completed, the weight should be measured extremely heavily, and the directors and supervisors should be elected first to facilitate the process." Then, Zhou Meiquan, Wu Yunshang, and other gentlemen seconded the motion and expressed their opinions. As a result, the motion was passed to add shares from previous profits, and the case of Zhuang Xi's case was transferred to the eight-factory share capital and issued long-term deposit slips. Then, nine directors and three supervisors were re-elected. Jin Baoguang, Cheng Baitang, Zhang Xiaoruo, Wu Jichen, Gao Hefu, Li Qiqing, Xu Taoan, Zhao Shuyong, and Zhou Meiquan were elected as directors. Chen Guangfu, Fang Juchuan, and Yun Jishen were elected as supervisors.</p>
<p>▲ Factory Two: The shareholders' meeting of Factory Two was held at the Bank Association on the afternoon of the twelfth, attended by shareholders representing a total of 4,450 shares. Mr. Hu Kezhi was elected chairman, and the formalities were performed as usual. First, Chairman Zhang Xiaoruo reported on the company's situation and the company's revised mortgage contract, which had been agreed to by the creditors, and a discretionary payment was made to reorganize the machinery. Then, supervisors Li Bake and Zhang Dongfu reported on the accounts. Committee representative Zhou Meiquan reported on the beginning and end of the committee's assistance to the factory affairs. Later, Shareholder Wu distributed printed materials, questioning the borrowing and mortgaging of Factory Two by Factory One. Therefore, shareholders Yang Guanchang, Gu Shaoyi, etc. requested the chairman to explain the truth of the matter. Wu Jichen detailed the process of the matter and the reason why Dasheng factories have always been consistent in their dealings with the outside world, and that they should help each other in times of difficulty. Zhou Meiquan, Shen Yanmou, Shen Zhihan, and others further explained, and all the shareholders suddenly realized. Then, directors and supervisors were elected. A total of seven directors were elected: Shen Yanmou, Wang Dankui, Xu Jingren, Zhang Xiaoruo, Zhang Dongfu, Xu Jiyu, and Zhou Zishan were elected. Two supervisors, Li Bake and Shen Kunsan, were elected.</p>
<p>▲ Factory Three: The shareholders' meeting of Factory Three was held at the same place on the thirteenth. Shareholders representing a total of 10,529 shares attended, and Mr. Hu Kezhi was elected chairman. The formalities were performed as usual. Board of directors representative Zhang Xiaoruo reported on the progress of the factory. Committee representative Zhou Meiquan reported on the beginning and end of the committee's task. Next, regarding the proposed matters, Shareholder Li inquired about the current profit situation. Director Wu Jichen explained on the spot that although the current profit is 200,000 taels, it is difficult to distribute it to shareholders because there is a contract with the syndicate to repay the debt first. In the future, the new board of directors can discuss with the syndicate to extract a portion of the profit and distribute dividends. After a long discussion by shareholders such as Zhang Chuba, Zhou Meiquan, and Zhao Hansheng, the consensus was that the bank must be required to retain a portion of the surplus, or add shares to pay off a small amount of debt, so that dividends can be issued as soon as possible. It was resolved: (1) To instruct the new board of directors to do its best to consult with the creditors and revise the mortgage contract, so that a portion of the surplus will be used to repay the debt, and a portion will be used to distribute dividends. (2) To add 220,000 taels of shares to make up the share capital to 2.5 million taels. Then, directors and supervisors were elected. Wu Tingfan, Zhang Xiaoruo, Guan Ji'an, Shen Yanmou, Wu Jichen, Yang Dunfu, and Zhou Weibin were elected as directors. Chen Zixun and Li Yunhou were elected as supervisors.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Cai Linzhen Sues for Divorce <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Cai Gensheng, a local resident, lives at No. 161, Zhilu, South Railway Station, and makes a living by farming. He has only one daughter, named Linzhen, who is currently nineteen years old. On December 12th of last year, she was married to Zhu Qiuyan, the son of Zhu Wu, residing at No. 28, Tianzhutang Street, Maluqiao, through a matchmaker. Not long after she entered the family, the couple developed disagreements due to money issues, leading to frequent conflicts. The mother-in-law and daughter-in-law also fell out of favor because of this. Now, Cai Linzhen has hired lawyer Liu Xiang to file a divorce lawsuit in the local court. The reason is that she was abused and driven out by the defendant Zhu Qiuyan and his mother, Zhu Wu, and that the plaintiff's dowry was moved and hidden elsewhere. She requests permission to divorce and return all the dowry and compensation of 700 yuan. Because the plaintiff is only nineteen years old, her father, Cai Gensheng, is also listed as her legal representative. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Jinjian specially opened the Ninth Tribunal to hear the case. The defendant Zhu Qiuyan was absent, and only Zhu Wu appeared in court. After the judge took the seat, he first took the plaintiff Cai Linzhen's statement of the events. (Question) What are you requesting? (</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Answer) Because I have been repeatedly oppressed by the defendants, I request permission to divorce and request the return of the dowry worth 1,277 yuan. (Question) How many requests do you have? (Answer) There are four points in total. (1) Request for divorce. (2) Return of the dowry. (3) Compensation, that is, alimony of 700 yuan. (4) The costs of this case should be borne by the defendant. (Question) Why are you suing Zhu Wu? (Answer) Because all the property is managed by Zhu Wu, and she said that since I entered the family last December until January this year, the defendant Zhu Qiuyan asked me for gold jewelry and ordered me to borrow 3,000 yuan from my mother's relatives. I went home to discuss with my parents, who thought the amount was too large and could not be borrowed at once. Before long, Qiuyan ordered me to return to my mother's house and borrowed 200 yuan. In June, Qiuyan wanted to ask me to borrow money from my mother's house but could not, so he beat me and moved the dowry to Zhang Tinggui's house. After I returned to my mother's house, he did not come to pick me up. (Question) What is the relationship between this Zhang Tinggui? (Answer) It is said that he is an adoptive grandfather. I don't know how. My husband and mother-in-law both listen to him. I don't know why. Next, the defendant Zhu Wu stated that she is 46 years old, from Shanghai, and that Zhu Qiuyan is my son. He is currently in Hangzhou collecting debts, so he is not here. The young couple usually get along very well and have never fought, but there have been quarrels. (Question) Was there any borrowing? (Answer) No. After my daughter-in-law returned to Ning in June this year, she left and never returned. (Question) Is the plaintiff's dowry still there? (Answer) It is still there. All the items sent to other places are my daughter's dowry and my belongings, not my daughter-in-law's dowry. (Question) Your daughter-in-law is requesting a divorce. What is your opinion? (Answer) I don't want to. I am a poor person. It is not easy to marry a daughter-in-law. I taught my son that he must first greet his daughter-in-law and not be too suspicious. I treat my daughter-in-law the same as I treat my daughter, etc. Then, Cai Gensheng stated that he is 41 years old. (Question) Why don't you persuade your daughter not to divorce? (Answer) I have persuaded my daughter, but it is really because she has been repeatedly abused. My daughter's divorce from her son-in-law is also embarrassing for me. The judge ordered Zhu Qiuyan to be summoned to court for trial and adjourned the court.</p>

<p>The Lung Disease Sanatorium at No. 2 and No. 4, Great West Road, Shanghai, in view of the recent global methods of treating lung diseases, has moved away from the inherent internal medicine scope, and uses surgical methods of treatment to directly compress lung cavities and achieve complete cure. The hospital, in view of the increasing number of people using surgery to treat lung diseases, and the large number of Chinese people suffering from surgical tuberculosis, has built a bone tuberculosis hospital, because the original second and third hospitals are insufficient to accommodate them. Dr. Engel, a German surgeon and orthopedic expert, and Dr. Huang Dinghu, are the chief directors. Construction has been underway for nearly a year. All</p>
<p>The construction and internal equipment were completed yesterday. There are lung surgery rooms and electrical lung treatment rooms. The interior of the new hospital is completely a very pleasing light yellow color. The ward equipment is also different in each room. The windows have been specially enlarged, and the light and air are extremely sufficient. Each room has a water temperature regulator. The flying springs, sunken fish, flowers and trees in the garden are quiet and beautiful. It can be called a good place for recuperation in Shanghai. The image on the left is the front of the new hospital. It is heard that the hospital's medical affairs are becoming more and more busy, and from today, German lung disease expert Dr. Feinerhi will be hired to visit the hospital for consultation.</p>

<p>▲ Extremely Immoral and Wicked</p>
<p>▲ To Be Treated as Rape</p>
<p>Lu Xiaomei, a 17-year-old girl from Liuhe, has lived in the village since childhood. With the consent of her parents, she was betrothed to the son of a certain family in the village. At that time, she entered the family as a child bride. Unexpectedly, her fiancé suddenly died last year. Xiaomei was unwilling to stay in her mother-in-law's house, so in April this year, she came to Shanghai alone. Through the introduction of her acquaintance sister-in-law, she worked as a female worker in a yarn factory in Caojiadu, north of Shanghai, to make a living. Now, Zhou A Xiao, a native of Nanxiang, 30 years old, accidentally met Xiaomei on the</p>

<p>▲ Due to Rapid Tide and Swift Current, He Has Likely Drowned</p>
<p>▲ Yang Xueheng's Body Has Not Yet Been Recovered</p>
<p>Recently, the northeast wind has been strong, and the tide has been high. Yesterday was supposed to be a minor flood tide, but the tide was no different from a major flood tide. The water flow was very swift, and the water color was muddy red. At half past one yesterday afternoon, the Ningbo salted crab boat "Xi He Xing" was docked at the Pujiang Riverbank of Wusong East Wharf. The helmsman, Yang Xueheng, 32 years old, from Ningbo, bought an iron anchor ashore and hired a sampan to row to the side of the crab boat. While Yang was carrying the iron anchor onto the boat, he lost his footing due to the surge of the tide, and he and the anchor fell into the center of the river together. Although the sampan crew tried to rescue him, the tide was too swift and the current too rapid. In a short time, he disappeared completely, presumably having drowned. The boat crew reported the incident to Shunfa Tax Reporting Agency, and they are currently trying to recover the body.</p>

<p>▲ Li Declares He Will Appeal</p>
<p>Li Linfa (also known as Yu San), a local resident, was previously arrested by Chief Detective Mao Yiwen of the Hongkou Police Station and others for repeatedly committing major crimes. Later, when the detectives led Li to a pawnshop to recover stolen goods, Li escaped from his handcuffs.

<p>▲ Office Located in Minhang, Shanghai</p>
<p>The joint defense of Shanghai, Nanhui, Songjiang, and Fengxian counties has held two meetings to resolve all matters and has passed the joint defense regulations, which have been submitted to the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department for review. Subsequently, it was determined that the general headquarters of the four-county joint defense must be located in a central location accessible to all four counties for convenient communication. It has been decided that Minhang Town in Shanghai County is the most suitable location. The office will be established and begin operations on the 10th of this month. It was previously decided at the joint defense meeting to hold a grand joint patrol on the 15th, with each county notifying each other of the names of the stationed police units and the names of the officers in charge at the border areas, and preparing arrangements separately.

<h3 id="e137">Proclamation on the Cessation of Collecting Defense Corps Donations <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps Reorganization Committee issued a proclamation yesterday, stating: "Regarding the matter of this proclamation, all teams under the former Shanghai Songhu Defense Corps have been taken over and reorganized by this committee as ordered. The voluntary donations previously contributed by local merchants and residents in the Hunan and Zhabei districts to the defense corps have also been ordered by this committee to cease collection. No fundraising is allowed under any pretext. However, we have heard that some unscrupulous individuals are daring to impersonate the defense corps and continue to collect donations as before. Merchants and residents, unaware of this, have fallen victim to their fraud and regard it as a regular contribution, which is deeply regrettable. It should be known that the regular expenses of all teams under this committee are approved by the Shanghai Municipal Government and disbursed monthly by the Municipal Finance Bureau to each district team. If expenses are economized, there is no need to worry about shortages and no need to solicit donations, which would cause disturbance and burden. Therefore, we solemnly declare that if anyone is found falsely claiming to be the Hunan or Hubei teams of the defense corps, or any team under them, and soliciting voluntary donations from local merchants and residents, they should be reported by name or detained. This committee will investigate and punish them severely according to the law, without leniency. For fear of insufficient information, this proclamation is hereby issued."</p>
<h3 id="e138">Chinese Vessels Gather in Xunbu Along the Yangtze River <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>▲ Decline in Trade Between Jiangxi and Shanghai</p>
<p>▲ Sluggish Passenger and Freight Traffic to Xunbu</p>
<p>Navigation on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, in the Jiujiang area, has recently been subject to stricter precautions. Moreover, the import and export of goods in Jiangxi Province have declined sharply. The recent situation is described below:</p>
<p>▲ Jiangxi Rice Stopped Coming: In the past ten days, the export of rice from Jiangxi has been stopped. Therefore, the arrival of Jiangxi rice to Shanghai has been nonexistent in recent days. The reason for the suspension is due to local unrest, causing a temporary halt to shipments. Therefore, the Guang Gang (Guangdong Merchants) has turned to Wuhu, buying 180,000 bags of rice to be shipped to Guangdong, having chartered the Longshan ship, which is scheduled to depart today. All Jiangxi rice is temporarily not loaded.</p>
<p>▲ Departure Goods Greatly Reduced: After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Jiangxi Gang (Jiangxi Merchants) sent telegrams to Shanghai, ordering a temporary halt to the loading of large quantities of goods for export to Jiangxi. As a result, in recent days, the outbound trips of British and Japanese Yangtze River vessels have seen a sharp decline in cargo bound for Jiujiang. Yesterday, the outbound cargo carried by Jardine Matheson and Nisshin Kisen's Yangtze River vessels and unloaded in Jiujiang for overland transport amounted to only 176 pieces. It seems that the goods that have been prepared are too afraid to be loaded.</p>
<p>▲ Vessel Precautions: British and Japanese Yangtze River vessels, averaging five or six daily navigating the Yangtze River, face frequent dangers in the Xunhan section. Therefore, the naval escorts for each vessel have been increased by two additional soldiers, totaling more per ship. Approaching Jiujiang, the soldiers prepare their guns. In the Xunhan section, in addition to British and Japanese warships patrolling to protect vessel traffic, China's Yangtze River Fleet has been requested to dispatch three additional warships to assist.</p>
<p>▲ Merchant Vessels Gather in Xunbu: The Chinese merchant vessels suspending operations initially numbered ten, distributed across Hankou and Nanjing. Beginning last week, all have been dispatched to Jiujiang. Vessels such as "Gongping," "Taishun," "Jiangtian," "Jiahe," "Yongxing," "Fulong," "Dexing," etc., all arrived in Jiujiang from Pukou within the past week. Just after these vessels arrived in Xunbu, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanpei Steam Navigation Company, and others dispatched an additional eight Jianghai vessels, including "Jiangxin" and "Huayang," all sailing to Jiujiang. Consequently, there are now seventeen or eighteen merchant vessels suspending operations in Jiujiang, gathered at that port.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Those Who Arrange Passports for Peddlers to Go Abroad <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>▲ Municipal Public Security Bureau Conducting Strict Investigations</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly received telegrams from Minister Jiang in Germany and Minister Gao in France, stating that there are many Chinese peddlers abroad, hawking on the streets and resembling beggars, which is detrimental to the national image. In addition to taking steps to compel them to return home, they requested that the provincial and municipal governments be consulted to strictly crack down on the issuance of passports to these peddlers and impose restrictions. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government, instructing the passport-issuing agencies to comply. Since the strict crackdown, peddlers seeking to go abroad to do business have been scheming everywhere. Some have even traveled to the Guangdong Municipal Government to apply for passports. Some, such as so-and-so, who specialize in arranging passports for these peddlers, have devised a plan to smuggle them abroad, halving the cost of the boat fare per person and bribing the ship's crew to hide the peddlers in the engine room or dress them as sailors to impersonate crew members. These peddlers and merchants are willing to hide anywhere, as long as they can reach their destination. Although they are sometimes discovered by the shipping company and ordered ashore, they continue to try. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau has learned that these "dai ke" (agents), who only care about their own profits, are extremely despicable. It is sending personnel to secretly investigate and punish them according to the law.</p>

<p>The coal carriers of the Zhanghuabang Grain and Rice Wharf and various coal companies in Songnan have been working together with various foremen. However, on August 1st of this year, when the Shanghai-Ningbo Railway Company held a bidding, Mr. Chen Shaofu, a prominent merchant in Shanghai, won the bid. He then subcontracted it to Liu Yinzhang for 41 cents per ton. Liu and another foreman, Wu Shouyin, had a conflict due to a misunderstanding. After repeated mediation by friends, a major disaster was averted. However, work was suspended for a long time. It was not until yesterday that Wu Zhengyou and Hou Shaoqing, who advanced the money for the silver, worked hard to resolve the issue, explaining the circumstances of the misunderstanding. Liu and Wu then realized that the conflict had nothing to do with Chen Shaofu, so they expressed their deep apologies to Chen. It has been agreed that Sun Lishan and Wu Shouyin will continue to subcontract the work together for 33 cents per ton. Both parties have signed a contract, which will be implemented on the 15th (today).</p>

<p>▲ Ant-Matchmaker Mo Fusheng Caught</p>
<p>Mo Fusheng, a famous ant-matchmaker residing near Yu Botitian Bridge in Pudong, was arrested by the Fourth Branch of the Sanlintang County Public Security Bureau in January of this year for a case involving the enticement of women. Two police officers were assigned to escort Mo and others involved in the case to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau for interrogation. However, when the prisoner Mo Fusheng got off the tram at the Ximen tram station, he took advantage of the escorting police officers' momentary lapse in attention and escaped with his handcuffs. At that time, the Public Security Bureau dismissed the two police officers and investigated the matter. Now, Mo, believing that several months had passed and the matter had subsided, secretly returned home. This was discovered by the Fourth Branch, which dispatched police to arrest him and send him to the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, he was brought in for interrogation. Mo admitted to the escape but claimed that the handcuffs had been destroyed and discarded on the way, making it impossible to hand them over. The judge ordered him to be detained pending investigation and punishment by the court.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>We recently saw in your newspaper's local news section a report stating that a shed belonging to the Futai Lumber Company on Caishi Road collapsed yesterday afternoon, severing electric wires and causing all the nearby lights to go out due to the power outage. Fortunately, no one was injured, etc. We were surprised and alarmed to read this. Upon investigation, the shed was actually hooked by a tram's iron pole and pulled down. Your newspaper's report that it "suddenly collapsed" completely obscures the fact that it was struck. Therefore, we hereby clarify this matter and request that it be published in the "Letters to the Editor" section for correction. This is our earnest request. Respectfully submitted to the Chief Editor of Shen Bao. Sincerely, Futai Lumber Company. October 14th.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Thank You to Supporters of the National Products Movement (Continuation 4) by Pan Gongzhan <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>From the above points, it is clear that the crux of the national products movement lies in the underdevelopment of production. To cure this underdevelopment, it is essential that all parties work together, openly and honestly, to find a solution. What are these areas that require the joint efforts of all parties? I will list them below, imitating the way a doctor prescribes medicine, in the form of a prescription for the revival of national products: (1) Labor-management cooperation: This is the first ingredient, used to dispel the vicious external evils. The illness has reached a point where strong medicine seems necessary. This requires both labor and management to cleanse their minds and openly cooperate to succeed. However, in the environment of the past two or three years, where problems have accumulated and become deeply ingrained, it is especially important for party branches and the government at all levels to take more responsibility, provide strong support, and carefully manage the situation. They should not be short-sighted and only consider the labor side, nor should they favor the capitalists in a way that leads to imbalances. Instead, they should guide both parties to understand the difficulties faced by national product factories and workers, ensuring that everyone operates within the bounds of the law and avoids deception. Only then can there be hope for recovery. It is especially important to severely punish those who obstruct cooperation, those "labor thieves" who exploit the labor movement for personal gain. (2) Reduce taxes and levies: This ingredient is used to nourish vital energy, and its importance is no less than the first. The responsibility for this lies entirely with the government, especially the financial authorities who control the power of taxation. There is an ancient saying, "draining the pond to catch all the fish." If the current heavy taxes and levies are not effectively reformed, we will reach a point where there are no fish left to catch. This method of killing the goose to get the golden eggs is not financial management. Without nurturing the source of tax revenue, only knowing how to increase taxes, the people's livelihood will naturally suffer more and more. We especially urge the government authorities to pay attention to the fact that tax rates should not favor foreign merchants at the expense of protecting Chinese merchants. They should reduce tax rates on national products while increasing taxes on foreign merchants. Even if a tariff protection policy cannot be implemented immediately, they should at least move in that direction. If our tax laws effectively protect foreign merchants, creating unequal treatment between Chinese and foreign businesses, it would be absurd. If the government does not substantially reduce taxes and levies, but merely issues empty promises to promote national products, the industrial and commercial sectors should rise up and urge them to take action. (3) Pool capital: This ingredient is also an essential tonic. The weak capital of domestic factories is insufficient to compete with domestic and foreign factories, let alone large foreign factories. As previously stated, industries like national product matches already feel the need to merge operations due to the heavy pressure from Swedish merchants. In fact, all national product businesses should quickly start by pooling capital to engage in larger-scale production. However, it is necessary for those in charge of companies to respect the law, ethics, and the rights of shareholders. Shareholders, on the other hand, should also not forget their own rights and responsibilities and should not allow managers to engage in fraud and self-enrichment. Only then can Chinese companies establish substantial credibility and use the name of a large company to attract large amounts of capital for centralized operation. If they continue to operate on a small scale individually, they will never be able to gain a foothold. (4) Scientific management: This seems like a foreign new medicine, something trendy doctors want to adopt. However, it is not adopted because it is trendy, but because it can improve the current management methods of domestic factories. Its purpose is to improve work efficiency and reduce unnecessary waste, which seems to be for the benefit of the capitalists. But at the same time, if management is effective and arrangements are appropriate, workers will not be overworked, and diligence will be rewarded accordingly. This is also for the benefit of the workers. Moreover, large-scale production, reduced costs, and lower prices benefit society as a whole, which is of great benefit to the general public. However, to use and administer this medicine, each factory must first have a foundation of labor-management cooperation and earnestly recruit talent. Only then can the medicine be administered correctly and its scientific effectiveness be demonstrated. Otherwise, if ignorant factory owners or managers use good names to excessively oppress and exploit workers' sweat and blood, calling it "scientific management," it will not only be useless but also harmful. This is similar to the story in a certain newspaper about a doctor in the countryside who used "aspirin" as a specific medicine for treating meningitis, deceiving villagers into swallowing it and delaying their treatment, resulting in death. This is another crime. (5) Rest and Recuperation: This is also a very important matter. For example, when facing a serious illness, rest and recuperation are needed. In addition to taking medicine, nursing care must also be appropriate. There must be an environment suitable for recuperation, allowing the patient to live in quiet isolation to recover. Otherwise, in the noisy city, mental and physical exhaustion will deepen the illness. The domestic industry and commerce are so depressed, partly due to the impact of war and banditry. The industrial and commercial sectors should know that without a unified government, there will be no peaceful situation, and without a peaceful society, it is impossible to develop industry. Therefore, for the present plan, we can only use our strength to promote unification, urge the government to implement reorganization and disarmament, strictly suppress bandits, eliminate the Communist Party, stabilize the local population, so that agricultural production can be revitalized, and transportation can be convenient. Then, after several years of rest and recuperation, the industry and commerce of national products will naturally gradually prosper. In short, the five ingredients mentioned above are all essential conditions for saving the fate of national products. If we sincerely hope for the development of national products and replace foreign goods, then the party branch, the government, and the industrial and commercial sectors should work together and share the responsibility, so that the national product production industry can gradually flourish, meet the needs of the Chinese people, and achieve self-sufficiency. Then, the general public's consumption will naturally be happy to adopt national products. In this National Products Movement Conference, in addition to encouraging the general public to purchase national products as much as possible, what we can offer in return to the enthusiastic supporters is only this sincere word: "Let us all work together to solve the difficulties facing the future of national products." September 25, 1930, in Shanghai. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e154">A Word of Wisdom <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Long</p>
<p>▲ The tongue survives through softness, the teeth are broken through opposition. Therefore, in our words and deeds, we should not be too sharp.</p>
<p>▲ If the art of returning to youth succeeds, the method of abstaining from grains will be essential. Otherwise, with limited resources and a growing population, the struggle among humans will inevitably intensify.</p>
<p>▲ Marriages arranged by matchmakers in the past were like playing hide-and-seek. Present-day free love has a speculative nature.</p>
<p>▲ The human heart is treacherous, and it is impossible to guard against everything. Only those who are indifferent to fame and gain can avoid all troubles.</p>
<p>▲ The day of marriage is the day love succeeds and also the day love breaks down.</p>
<p>▲ Half of the suicides in the world are indeed caused by harsh environments, and the other half are due to weak abilities.</p>
<p>▲ In the beginning of mutual admiration between men and women, there is an unspeakable joy in their hearts. Once married, they find it is nothing more than that.</p>
<p>▲ Children are the crystallization of the two sexes and the seeds of trouble. Because they not only add to your burden but also have the power to divide the love of the person in your heart.</p>
<p>▲ Cars are originally for busy people to travel, but the riders invariably want them to be fast and reach their destination in an instant. Even more people use them for joyrides as a fashion. No wonder news of car accidents often appears before our eyes.</p>
<p>▲ Occasionally, one or two foreign sailors are found on the road wearing Chinese melon-shaped hats. When Chinese people see them, they are all surprised. Looking back at the Chinese who wear Western suits and leather shoes, and felt hats and sticks, with a lively expression, I am afraid that the blue-eyed people are also secretly laughing.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Watching Autumn Dance Late at Night in Dahua <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Langgan</p>
<p>This year, the Liaoxi area suffered an extraordinarily severe flood. Zhang Hanqing, the chief administrator of the Northeast, was deeply concerned about it and repeatedly tried to find ways to provide relief. In Shanghai, the lead was taken by prominent figures such as Mr. Du Yuesheng, who initiated a charity performance by celebrities, which achieved remarkably impressive results. Following this was the unprecedented costume carnival organized by Dr. Zheng Yuxiu, which was held at the Dahua Hotel on Gordon Road two days after Double Ten Day. The meeting was originally scheduled to begin at nine o'clock, but by eight o'clock the venue was already packed. Those who arrived later continued to come in an endless stream. Dr. Zheng, having just recovered from enteritis, could not bear the fatigue, so her sister, Ms. Zheng Huichen, and others temporarily took over the arrangements. Mr. Yu Ziying, Yang Zhaoyun, Xu Yunxuan, and others coordinated everything, working very busily. Their enthusiasm was truly admirable.</p>
<p>▲ Golden Splendor: Before the opening ceremony, the municipal government's public security bureau military band played music, followed by a dance performance by the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School. The five dancers were all dressed in gold-threaded garments, illuminated by electric lights, creating a dazzling and dreamlike effect. It was no wonder that applause arose from all around the venue.</p>
<p>▲ Bizarre and Colorful: Following this was a bizarre and colorful costume dance. Mr. Zhang Xiaolin and Mr. Wang Xiaolai were the most enthusiastic. Mr. Zhang wore a Western suit, a mask over his eyes, and a white beard attached to his mouth, looking exactly like a foreign deity of the land. Mr. Wang covered his eyes with black floral paper, revealing a slight smile on his face, and his steps were orderly, like those of a seasoned craftsman. Mrs. Feng Dengna wore a costume from the opera "Chun Xiang's Mischievous Schooling," looking remarkably like the character. Ms. Zheng Huichen dressed as Huang Tianba. It was said that her costume was prepared by Dr. Zheng, who originally intended to play the role herself but later had Ms. Huichen take over. As for the rest, the costumes were of all colors and varieties, too numerous to describe in detail.</p>
<p>▲ Melodious National Music: Next was the national music performed by the Datong Music Society. Previously, I had the opportunity to hear their elegant music at a garden party held by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and I described it with the words "bright moon and clear sky, gentle breeze." It was truly the sound of a peaceful and prosperous age. It was said that the establishment of the society received considerable support from Wang Xiaolai. That evening, Wang personally conducted, which shows his sincere appreciation.</p>
<p>▲ Grape Fairy: The Grape Fairy of the Star Film Company was one of the highlights of the event. This opera was originally a children's game, but now it was performed by adults. It seemed that the fairy had been upgraded to a great fairy. Hu Die played the fairy, her demeanor graceful and her voice particularly clear and bright. In the future, when it is made into a sound film, there will be much to rely on. Other female actors had delicate expressions, and the male actors added humor, both of which were beyond the capabilities of child actors. Zheng Qiu, Jian Yun, Hong Shen, Bu Gao, and others were on site to take care of things, acting as if they were directors.</p>
<p>▲ Famous Actors Singing and Dancing: Finally, famous actor Cheng Yanqiu performed the sword dance from "The Legend of Hong Fu." Cheng had already donated 2,000 yuan to the Liaoxi flood disaster at the request of the Beiping Relief Association. This time, he generously agreed to participate, completely voluntarily, which was admirable. During the sword dance, applause thundered. Many Westerners also valued it as worth watching, all marveling at it. At the end, due to audience demand, Cheng put in extra effort as it was a charity event, singing his masterpiece "Willow Welcoming Spring Nan Bangzi" to entertain the audience, almost every word was worth applause. That day happened to be Sunday, and the Grand Theatre had a daytime performance. Cheng performed both day and night. Although he was extremely tired, he was still so enthusiastic about the event. It was truly commendable.</p>
<h3 id="e156">A Record of Floating on Yuan Lake Under the Moonlight <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Chunshu</p>
<p>My home is on the Baiyun Stream in Biling. Su Dongpo's old Purple Vine House and Yun Nantian's Ouxiang Old Hall are across the stream from each other. Singing and painting, all glory and shame are discarded. Having experienced the tragedy of Yuan Xiang this summer, I indulged even more in the pleasure of traveling the mountains. Yesterday, I traveled with Yu Lu on Qin Chuan, and hung Crane Yi from Su Men. As soon as I returned, the Ming Society comrades invited me to swim in Yuan Lake on the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, to drink wine at the Yanyu Tower, and to hold a moonlit floating ceremony. So I transferred to Shanghai to go there. The poets of Jiangsu and Zhejiang who came to the meeting, young and old, were another twenty-two people. Such as Qingpu Xu Gongxiu, Wuxing Yao Diyuan, Hai Ning Chen Yitao, and Zhou Bianxi Daling from Hangzhou, Gu Xieguang’s chief secretary from Yue, Dai Boxin's father and son from, Zhu Dake took his eleven-year-old Xiao Ke. First came from Shanghai to take care of everything. The club title is Yuanhu Rafting Song, and Moonlit Night. So he opened the old brewing bamboo leaves, ate the famous dishes of Huili. One ship leisurely, good works one after another. Poetry chanted a hundred chapters. Lingge rose up. In the seat were only Wujiang Qinmu and I as painters. They were assigned to paint Zhu An’s Tansui and Yuanhu Fanyue. Title name Ben Juan first on the spot. Divided by seniority. Xiao Ke can also sing. Compensation and response are eloquent. They are all regarded as prodigies. At three o'clock, the boat reached Zhu An. An Zhuan originated from the Ming Dynasty. The courtyard has two trees of Taiwan Gui. Qiu Zhi is curved and has six or seven layers like a cover. More than sixteen feet high. Xin is a thing of three hundred years. Dake showed Jin Yong Lao Zhu Gu Wei. Titles long scrolls by famous people. It is also valuable. At three o'clock, I returned to the boat. I boarded Yanyu Tower together. It is in the water. It is like Xiaoyingzhou in West Lake. But the corridor and pavilion are uneven. The trees and rocks are towering. Looking at the lake and sky. Lingtang crab house. All into the painting. Then the setting sun on the water. The magical performance is over. Sumeru rises in the east. The smoke scene changed. The secluded reward is over time. Put in the middle stream. Eat plenty of Huling. Each chants good sentences. For example, Yao Zhang has 30 seven-character quatrains with upper and lower levels. Zhian's Fu Shui Tiao Ge Tou is also Yache. I only composed eight chapters. Then Zhuang Jingting and other six people returned to Shanghai. Yao Xuchen Wu. Go to Haining to watch the night tide. I and Ji Fan Xieguang Bianxi went to Hangzhou. Re-float on the moon lake. I had a picture of Autumn Rafting in Taihu Lake in October two years ago. There is a picture of spring rafting in Wuhu Lake in February. There are already pictures of Lantingshu on it. All are well-known in Jiang Zhe Yilin. Or eighteen people. Or more than twenty people. There are registration marks. Deng Zhuben talks about it. And combine it with today's tour. The picture will be completed. Early in the morning, I traveled to Tai Dai Lu Yue. Tiantai Yandang returned. I have completed one hundred and sixty paintings and poems of winning travels. I once composed a seven-character poem in the rhyme of Wushan. Now in the car. He also composed a poem about the Five Lakes. I floated over Poyang Lake and rafted in Taihu Lake. I had finished swimming in Shang Lake and Yuan Lake again. I came to Qinshui to sing in the Guiyuan Garden. I sang and wrote in Lanting for a mirror lake. Sitting with books to pass the years. Travel to see traces in Jianghu. Tomorrow I will go to West Lake again. Enjoy the Mid-Autumn Festival and drunk Moon Lake together. Poem completed. Xie Guang said. It is truly an innovation in seven-character poems. It can also be said to be a new chant of lakes and mountains. The car arrived in Hangzhou. Write this note to feed the readers. (No compensation)</p>
<h3 id="e157">Sitting in the Huaguang Tongle Meeting <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Shixun</p>
<p>When the past of life comes to the time of "recollection" and "discrimination", all the joy seems to be full of sorrow. I feel this every time. And I hope that I will have less happy life now. Lest the stone city of sorrow hinder my future.</p>
<p>The National Day seems to be worth my revelry. But sitting in the Huaguang Tongle Club in Dahua Hotel. Seeing the dance and hearing the music. As if they were hugging sharp swords and stabbing them into my ears. This is probably a special feeling. I think there will be no second discovery among the crowd sitting in the same field.</p>
<p>But I am not numb. I also applauded and praised Wang Qingxun's harmonica. Liang Saizhen's Cantonese opera. It's just from Ms. Liang's singing. I felt the loss of her youth again. And I worry about the general young girls.</p>
<p>Mr. Li Diyun is a strong general of the Lianqing Society. Thanks to his arrangement, this amusement is well-organized. He met me. He said to me. Have you been away from Shanghai for a long time? Yes. In fact, I have never left Shanghai, which is full of troubles. It's just that I can't feel interested in the lively gatherings. Alas, prosperous Shanghai. It's just a "river of troubles" in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Lin Zecang is my old friend. His spirit of doing things is worth my admiration. But every time I see him being criticized by outsiders. It gave me a strange idea. People all over the world who love to do public affairs will inevitably have to pay for their own money to listen to gossip. After all, which career can make everyone feel satisfied? Probably first-class smart people can't find this answer either.</p>
<p>Alas, life, alas, happiness. Can't stand reminiscing. Can't stand discriminating. Try a little bit of the pleasure in front of you. Avoid a share of future sorrow. This is what I got from the clear songs and beautiful dances in the Dahua Tongle Meeting. I don't hope that people will express sympathy. I just hope that people will make the same distinction as me.</p>

<p>— Wang Yachen</p>
<p>▲ Fine Arts in Florence Before and After the Renaissance</p>
<p>In the early Renaissance in Italy in the fifteenth century, painting was centered in Florence. At that time, artists from all directions came one after another. Famous writers. At that time, they also used their personal skills in Florence. Just like the current painters. I have to go to Paris. So the Florentine style at that time. Blow all over Italy. With such a glorious history. Once in that place. For the artistic relics left behind in the past. It makes us have endless reference. Every street corner. There is no place without traces of art. A traveler. Stepped on the land of Florence. There is no place that makes you feel uncomfortable. Especially for people who study fine arts.</p>
<p>Although the birthplace of art is far away in Greece and Egypt. But the most brilliant art flower that blooms in the art world. You have to start with Florence. The building there, painting, sculpture, is still a concentrated place. People in Europe who practice art. I have to go to pay my respects. I came to Europe to study art. There are too many places I want to run. It wasn't until late April this year that I arrived in Florence.</p>
<p>The group of beast painters said. Modern artists. There is no need to take the relics of the ancients as a guise. Just pursue nature and your own heart. But art cannot be separated from tradition. There is temptation from predecessors. There is more enlightenment from many people. Suppose the art galleries of various countries. All burned with fire. I think the artists in Europe who claim to be creative now. Will be wandering. After I studied the art of Florence before and after the Renaissance. Can't help but say something. Special notes to tell the people of the country.</p>
<p>(1) Uffizi Museum. This museum was formerly the private residence of the Italian Duke Offizi. Since 1560. Changed to Art Museum. The Duke's name is still in use today. The museum is located in the city of Fobu. In front is the Vecchio Ancient Palace. Later, it faces the beautiful Fiume River. The museum displays more than 40 paintings and sculptures. His works were first collected by Medici. In recent decades, fine products from all over the world have been collected within. Now it has become one of the world's famous art museums. From the height of the Renaissance to the end of the sixteenth century. All Florentine art. The museum is especially rich. The works of famous artists in central and southern Italy are also gathered in the museum. There are also Holland. Spain. Famous French works from the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries. Divided into several rooms.</p>
<p>Enter the museum and go up the stairs on the right. There is a large room on the second floor. Hundreds of woodcut prints are on display. And there are many works by famous woodcut printmakers from modern countries. Woodcut printing is very popular in European countries now. Each art museum. There are decorations. Only the one displayed in the Offizi Museum. For the most complete.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Emerald Bamboo Tears Stain the Woman's Broken Heart, the Fragrance of Red Lotus Fades and the Soul of a Girl Departs</p>
<p>Lianxiang was a good-natured person. She thought her destiny was to be a concubine. Even if the main wife was fierce, she would just lower her head and be a little obedient, and it would pass. She always looked at the master's face in everything. Now, the one we marry is the master, not the main wife. As long as the master is easy to talk to, he can take care of everything. Besides, before marrying Lianxiang, she saw him often returning late at night, without showing any fear of the people at home. Therefore, Lianxiang didn't take it to heart. Moreover, they didn't live in the same house. They were renting a small mansion outside. When she first entered the household, everyone said the situation was very good. Although they had deceived the female tiger, there were no flaws. However, after a few months, the people at home gradually found out. But they still didn't know where their small mansion was. They only knew that the master had taken a woman outside. How did the news leak out? It was said that it was spread by the servants. It turned out that Master Yin often went out in a carriage. The coachman was called Gensheng. Of course, he was Master Yin's confidant. No one else knew where Master Yin went every day, but the coachman Gensheng knew everything. Relying on the master having this secret agency, he also earned a lot of extra money. The master often told him not to talk nonsense at home. He casually told him, but he was a little uneasy. There was no way but to use money to shut his mouth. His wages were a given. He often overspent several months' wages. When he went to the accounting room to get his wages, the accountant refused to pay. He even argued with the accountant. The accountant had no choice but to ask the master for instructions. The master said, "Let him get a month's wages this time. He's not allowed to overspend again." In fact, the master was a little afraid of him. Later, he had to tell him, "Don't go to the accounting room to get your wages. Tell me when you need money." So he often said, "Gensheng, your cotton robe is not good to wear anymore. Go buy a new one." He also said, "Your hat and shoes are broken. Go buy a new hat and a new pair of shoes." Giving him ten or eight dollars was common. However, that Gensheng later hooked up with Aunt Jin, the main wife's hairstylist. Gensheng would naturally not reveal a word to others. But to Aunt Jin, he could no longer keep that secret. One day, Aunt Jin mentioned that the master was afraid of the main wife. Gensheng snorted in his nose and said, "Women are useless. How can they follow men all day long? No matter how fierce a woman is, the man will turn his back and trick her. They don't know that." Aunt Jin said, "Does the master also trick her?" Gensheng said, "Why not? He doesn't make a sound at home. When he goes outside, he laughs and talks. You see him being so proper at home. When he goes to the brothel, the girls and older sisters all want to welcome him. If you happen to go to the brothel, the master will also welcome you."</p>

<p>▲ Swap Nearing Expiry</p>
<p>▲ General Attitude: Watching and Waiting</p>
<p>▲ Fluctuations Limited to Two Taels: Yesterday, the 14th, the gold market was in a state of hovering. There were fluctuations of about two taels before and after the market opening, but no particular gains or losses. This was mainly because the swap period was approaching, and the exchange rate was calculated at under 50 taels per day. Both buyers and sellers were adopting a neutral attitude. Foreign exchange seemed to be tight, with many transactions among banks. The listed price continued to rise by half a point. There was some divergence in interbank trading, and sentiment was uncertain. In the morning session, Tai Hing, Tai Kang, Run Heng, and Xing Sheng, among others, were buying, while Zhi Feng, Yong Da, De Cheng, Yong Feng, and Fu Chang were mostly selling. The early market declined slightly, likely due to the increase in silver bar prices. Afterwards, there were sudden ups and downs, with the price once falling to around 561 taels. This was mainly due to active selling. At noon, major players made large purchases, causing the price to rise by two or three taels. In the afternoon, Yong Feng, Shun Li, and others were selling, while there were few buyers. The situation was relatively stable, with only one tael of fluctuation, hovering around 64 taels. The final price was 64 taels. The overall market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲ Slight Changes in the Morning Session: The November opening price was 562 taels and 5 mace, immediately falling by 1 tael and 4 mace. However, the gross trading reached about 3 taels before and after, and large bars had already risen by one-eighth. The silver price was stagnant due to the holiday shutdown. Afterwards, there were fluctuations of about one tael, from 63 taels 2 or 3 mace to 1 tael 6 or 7 mace. Then, Heng Xing and Sheng Da bought in, raising the price by 2 taels, to 63 taels 8 mace. The exchange rate for British gold this month among banks was 7 pence 5625, probably because the telegraphic transfer rate announced at 9:30 rose by 125, the US dollar increased by 2.5 jiao, and the Japanese gold price decreased by a small fraction, at 3 taels and 2 mace. However, the internal market was still stable. Zheng Jin bought this month's British telegraphic transfer at 7 pence 5625, so it immediately rose back to 5 or 6 mace, then to 3 taels and 8 mace. Later, the November British gold could be settled at 625. Yong Feng, Yuan Xing, Yong Zhi Feng, Yong Da, De Cheng, and others tended to sell, so the price fell by 3 taels, to 60 taels and 9 qian at 10:30. But in an instant, it immediately rose upwards, because Zhi Feng, Yong Tai, and others started to buy. HSBC also took long-term British gold at 6875, and Zheng Jin also bought January at the same price, so the price was pulled up by more than 1 tael. After 11 o'clock, Heng Xing, Tai Kang, Run Yong Kang, and others suddenly chased after, continuing to rise by more than 1 tael, reaching 63 taels and 8 mace, with only slight fluctuations of 2 or 3 qian. The noon closing price was 63 taels and 7 qian, then it rose again to 4 taels, mainly due to arbitrageurs constantly buying. The telegraphic transfer rate was changed to 610 taels and 2 qian because the Japanese gold price was listed at a small fraction, at 46 or 47 taels to 49 taels, and at 47 taels within the noon hour.</p>
<p>▲ The Afternoon Market Was Neither Good Nor Bad: The afternoon market opened at 63 taels 9 qian, then to 4 taels. Yong Feng, Yuan Mao Yong, and others came to sell, so it fell back to 63 taels 2 qian. Afterwards, Sumitomo and HSBC mutually traded December British gold at 7 pence 625. MacKay also bought in, and there seemed to be more buyers in the market, so it increased by 1 tael. Around 3 o'clock, it was 64 taels and 4 qian, then it decreased by a small 7 or 8 qian. At 4 o'clock, arbitrage houses made some purchases, so it rose to 64 taels 5 qian, and then there were slight advances and retreats of a few qian. The exchange rate was flat, and sentiment was not bad. The closing price at 4:30 was 64 taels, only increasing by 1 qian compared to the day before. However, the falling trend of many days has begun to subside. The highest price of the day was 64 and a half taels, and the lowest price was 60 taels and 9 qian, with a difference of 3 taels and 6 qian. The telegraphic transfer rate was still quoted at 45 or 46 taels. The logged prices were 68 taels to 64 taels, and the margin call was 68 taels. The goods opened at 2 and a half taels in the morning, closed at 4 taels at noon, 3 taels and 9 qian in the afternoon, and closed at 4 taels and 2 qian.</p>
<p>▲ Seemingly Inconsistent Inflows and Outflows: There were many transactions among the various firms. Tai Xing, Sheng Da, Tai Kang Run, Yong Kang, Yuan Tai, Yuan Mao, Jin An, and Yu Xing Yong all bought in. Zhi Feng Yong, Yuan Cheng Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Shun Li, Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, Yong Feng, Yuan Mao Yong, and Shun Li all sold. Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, and retail investors all bought in. However, the transactions of the various firms were not as strong as in the morning session. The Ningbo (Dalian) group still sold, totaling one thousand several hundred bars, with inflows of five or six hundred bars. The Guangdong group bought a total of one thousand four or five hundred bars, and speculators covered their short positions. According to people in the industry, the long side will still be paying four or five taels for this swap.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the overseas silver market saw further easing. However, due to the US holiday, the market was mediocre. There was no market for exchange rates between the British, American, and Japanese currencies. The Yokohama market rose slightly. The HSBC listed prices for all currencies had eased by half a point. The British gold price increased by 125, now at 1 shilling 7 pence 375; the US dollar increased by 25, at 39 yuan 25; the Indian rupee increased by 1 yuan 25, at 108 rupees and a half; the French franc increased by 7 yuan, at 1000 yuan; the Austro-Hungarian krone increased by half a yuan, at 97 kronen; the German mark increased by 1 yuan, at 165 marks; the Hong Kong dollar decreased by 25, at 82 taels; the Straits dollar decreased by 75, at 144 taels 25; and the Japanese yen decreased by a small fraction, at 1 tael 2 qian 6 and a half fen. As for the interbank market, the rates were weak in the morning, then flat, and seemed to ease in the afternoon, likely because the gold price fell and stabilized in the morning session, and the afternoon market was able to stand firm. The review of the day only amounted to a few taels and qian. Sentiment was still hovering. The result was only an increase of one qian. However, the exchange rate also eased slightly. The closing price increased by 0625 for British gold, 1875 for the US dollar, and fell by 375 for the Japanese yen compared to the day before, and the near and far terms have approached. Among Chinese gold firms, Fu Chang and others had mutual inflows and outflows, with several tens of thousands of pounds of British gold changing hands in the morning. Banks such as Zheng Jin and HSBC absorbed some, while Sumitomo sold. In the afternoon, HSBC and MacKay were still keen to buy, and Fu Chang and others sold tens of thousands of pounds, while Banque Belge sold slightly. As for interbank transactions, the total amounted to more than 100,000 pounds for the day. Japanese banks and Banque Belge sold positions, while HSBC and MacKay bought them. Furthermore, more than 100,000 yuan of US dollars were settled by the Dalian group and others, while there were still few transactions in Japanese gold.</p>
<h3 id="e162">British and Indian Silver Markets Recovered <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to London dispatches, large silver bars were still hovering, fluctuating suddenly and difficult to predict. The trend recovered upward. India bought, supply was scarce, and the market was calm. After the closing, there were no new developments due to the Citibank holiday. The near and far terms both recovered by 125, both at 16 pence 75 (equivalent to 1 shilling 7 pence 8125 for British gold). Also, the US silver price and the US-to-British/Japanese rates had no market due to the US holiday. The British-to-US rate fell by 0625, to 4 dollars 8 jiao 5 fen 78125 (the British-to-Japanese rate was still 2 shillings 6 pence 53125, and the London-Shanghai shilling was still 1 shilling 7 pence 75. The Bombay spot price increased by 2 annas, to 47 rupees 11 annas.

<h3 id="e163">Silver Dollar Market with Heavy Demand <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>▲ Market Overview: In addition to the summer season, the Shanghai silver dollar market usually has a certain amount of strong demand. Especially during the mid-autumn season, it is even more vibrant. The past issues of rice consumption have faded, and new flowers have reappeared. Its consumption is even better than the rice market. However, the new crops of this autumn harvest are not very ripe. Although it will not lead to famine, it is not as abundant as last year. Therefore, it is difficult to predict whether the demand for silver dollars will be sustainable. Looking at the current market situation, there are indeed excellent results.</p>
<p>▲ Interest Rates: The interest rate on silver dollars was 7 qian 2 fen 7 li and a half in the morning session, slightly better than the previous noon by 2 hao and a half. The noon session weakened by 3 hao and 7 hu and a half, to 7 qian 2 fen 7 li 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. The result was a decrease of 1 hao and 2 hu and a half compared to the previous day's noon session. However, the sources and destinations were approximately equal, with little difference, and the situation is expected to improve. The silver interest rate was 1 qian and 2 fen in the morning session, and 9 fen in the noon session. Adding water was 5 or 6 fen, and the bank listed price was 5 fen. The silver supply trend is still good. However, the banks have many empty accounts, so the interest rate cannot be very good.</p>
<p>▲ Subsidiary Currency Market Conditions: There were few transactions in the Jiangsu small silver dollars, and the market price was also weak. The morning price was 6 qian 4 fen and 4 li, and the noon price was 6 qian 4 fen and 6 li, decreasing by 1 li compared to the previous day's noon session. The transaction volume was 2,500 jiao in the morning session and 6,000 jiao in the noon session. The Guangdong small silver dollar price was 6 qian 3 fen 6 li and 7 hao and a half in the morning session, and 6 qian 3 fen 7 li and 2 hao and a half in the noon session, slightly better than the previous noon by 2 hao and a half. The transaction volume was 85,000 jiao in the morning session and 90,000 jiao in the noon session. The copper coin shrank by 1,000 wen, to 389,000 wen, with transactions of more than 33,000 strings.</p>
<p>▲ Silver Dollar Inflows and Outflows: The news of bank inflows yesterday was still not very strong, but it was better than usual. Chinese banks collected more than 2.6 million in notes, foreign banks collected more than 1.7 million or 1.8 million in notes, special funds collected more than 2 million, silk funds came out more than 200,000, various cargo, tax, and miscellaneous funds collected more than 8 million, collateral transactions were 4 or 500,000, 500,000 went into storage, and 600,000 came out of storage. Japanese banks collected more than 3.8 million in various funds, and 200,000 came out of storage. Money shops and silver public offices collected more than 35.5 million, head-shaving funds collected more than 3.7 million, and various remittance funds collected more than 900,000, with several tens of thousands in cash inflows. The telegraphic transfer transactions were 1.32 million in the morning session and 1.07 million in the noon session. There were no transactions in banknotes in the morning session, and 57,000 were transacted in the noon session. Outside the exchange, the morning session was 153,000 and the noon session was 112,000. New currencies were 8 or 90,000 in both sessions. In bank trading, interbank trading was 600,000 in the morning session and 700,000 in the noon session. The incoming and outgoing foreign currency accounts of various banks collected more than 1.5 million, banknote inflows and outflows were more than 2.2 million, money shops and foreign public offices collected more than 4.2 million, foreign head-shaving funds collected more than 1.7 million, foreign currency borrowing was more than 1.9 million, and small counterparts transacted 6 or 700,000 in banknotes, telegraphic transfers, and new currencies. As for customer sources, 240,000 arrived from Hangzhou, and more than 400,000 were collected from various ports, with over 500,000 outflowing. Also, 5 or 600,000 in rice funds were loaded.</p>

<p>Yesterday, among the various government bonds, only the Consolidations and Financial bonds had some transactions, while the others had no market. The futures market was as flat as before. However, the 1920s Tariff bonds had more inflows and outflows. The Disbandment bonds were still good, followed by the Tariff Consolidations, and the 96 bonds were far inferior to before. The others were still clear. As for the changes in the various bonds, the trend was still firm in the early morning, with very slight fluctuations compared to the day before. Then, there were continued large sales of 1920s Tariff bonds on the market. Although various parties also actively bought them, the supply still exceeded demand, and the bonds continued to weaken further compared to the day before. Other bonds also declined slightly as a result. In the afternoon, they were all hovering, with the October 7th Year Tariff Bonds, October 1920s Tariff Bonds, and November 1920s Tariff Bonds all falling by about 1 yuan compared to the day before. October 1920s Tariff bonds also fell by a small 7 jiao, while the others only rose or fell by several jiao. The total transaction volume for spot goods was only 6,000 yuan for the day, and the futures volume was 8.7 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Yarn and Cotton Markets Enter Soft Territory Again <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is weak again, mainly due to the dull demand for spot yarn. All the groups are lifeless, and some groups are selling 20-count Japanese yarn at reduced prices, which has greatly affected the market. Sentiment is becoming more and more vacant, and the Dongyang Sanpin yarn has fallen by 2 or 3 yuan. Retail investors mostly sell out, so the situation is depressed. However, a certain factory is still buying more. In short, the lack of current sales is a major blow to the yarn market.</p>
<p>▲ Decreased Yarn Prices: The market atmosphere was looser at the opening of the spot market, because Indian cotton was trending down and there was a lack of buyers in the market. The prices for each month fell by 8.9 cents to 1 tael and 1 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Sanpin yarn was trending down and spot yarn sales were not strong. The situation was still weak, but there was not much change, with the prices only rising or falling by 1 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 14,150 bales. Rong Xing sold 1,100 bales, Gong Tai 800 bales, Li Chang 900 bales, Shen Yu 1,300 bales, and others 3 or 400 bales. Xin Cheng bought 1,050 bales, Yu Da 1,250 bales, and others 3 or 400 bales. The closing price of the spot market is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Month | Spot Price | Change | Inventory | Month | Spot Price | Change | Inventory</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>October | 1515 | Down 10 | 26,250 | January | 1506 | Down 9 | 34,550</p>
<p>November | 1509 | Down 8 | 58,100 | February | 1507 | Down 10 | 26,250</p>
<p>December | 1505 | Down 11 | 38,650 | March | 1510 | Down 10 | 6,250</p>
<p>▲ Current Sales Turn Clear: Current yarn sales were clearer. It was found that the various groups bought a total of 820 bales for the day. Counterparts bought 100 bales. The market price of Japanese yarn fell by 5 qian. Customer groups bought 230 bales from Sichuan, 60 bales from inland, 70 bales from Shantou, 75 bales from Ningbo, 35 bales from Hankou, 110 bales from Xiamen, 100 bales from Changsha, 25 bales from Niuzhuang, and 115 bales from miscellaneous groups.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Cotton Market Regains Decline <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market rose and fell unevenly, actually because of the weakening global trend and the surplus of raw materials in various countries. In particular, the accumulation of Indian cotton is getting thicker. Now that the exchange rate has eased and the combined price of foreign cotton is especially cheap, foreign firms are urgently seeking outlets and making special price concessions. Therefore, Chinese and foreign factories are ordering unusually large quantities. This situation is rare in previous years. The local cotton trade is completely occupied by Indian and American cotton. Raw cotton transactions are very few. The future of the cotton market still has great changes. Although the bulls of the inland group have not yet moved, the Japanese merchants who bought in yesterday are now throwing out in large quantities.</p>
<p>▲ Cotton Futures Down 30-40 Cents: The opening of the Hankou spot market saw that although American cotton was closed, Indian cotton fell by another 2 rupees. In addition, the exchange rate was eased, and Japanese merchants sold unlimitedly. Each month fell by 2 qian, and 2 or 3 plates fell again. As a result, each fell by 30-40 cents. The market atmosphere was still weak in the afternoon, and there were no major ups and downs in each month. The total transaction volume for the day was 49,000 dan. Gong Tai sold 7,900 dan, Li Chang 1,900 dan, Chang Feng 2,600 dan, and others 1,800 or 1,900 dan. Yong Feng bought 3,500 dan, Jin Feng 2,800 dan, Yu Da 3,700 dan, and the others 1 or 2,000 dan. The closing price of the Hankou spot market is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>▲ Actual Sales Show No Improvement: Raw cotton transactions are still clear, and there are large-scale Indian cotton trading activities. The sources include 2,300 bales of Yao flowers and 210 bales of Tong flowers. The sales panels are listed on the left.</p>

<p>▲ American Cotton Closed, British and Indian Continue Downward: Yesterday, American cotton was closed for the holiday, British cotton futures fell 3 or 4 points, spot fell 3 points, Egyptian cotton spot fell 5 points, Indian cotton initially rose with American cotton, but later softened due to long positions taking profits, with Ping Gear and Bai Luo Xi falling 2 rupees, and Aomura falling 1 rupee.

<h3 id="e168">Grain and Rice Markets: Firm and Weak Vary <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲ Zhabei: Yesterday, over fifty companies arrived on Luli Road. Sales were a mix of smooth and stagnant, resulting in different prices. New japonica rice was still weak due to the surge of goods, but the cloudy and rainy weather made the purchase appetite acceptable, with the price increasing slightly. Central Customs and other goods had slight discounts. The supply of thin rice was scarce, and sales were active. In addition, the continued decline in prices has triggered some digestion, so the overall market turned firm by one or two jiao. High-quality goods were around 15 yuan. The port tip reported good news, and the number of arrivals decreased sharply. Retail sales on this street were very strong, and the price therefore increased by about two jiao, with top-quality goods around 12 yuan. The inflow and sales of mutton glutinous rice were approximately equal, and the market was generally stable. Currently, it may turn into a hovering trend. New customer tip goods continue to arrive, and sales are weak. The market is difficult to improve, and the price is still slightly outside the corner. The overall price is around 10 yuan.</p>
<p>▲ Shanghai South: Yesterday, about forty companies arrived by river. Sales on this street continued to be sluggish. High-quality new japonica rice in the West Road declined slightly by nearly a jiao, and ordinary short-grain rice by two or three jiao. The overall trend was softer than in the North City. All the Jiangsu and Tongxiang new japonica rice were only quoted at 14 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao. The situation of the corner paddy and other kiln varieties of white rice from the South Gang was quite depressed. The actual inflow and sales were sluggish, the inventory was gradually increasing, and selling pressure was strong, so the price was difficult to maintain, at two or three jiao for short-grain rice. Mutton rice owners observed the market due to the over-decline in price, and were unwilling to sell cheaply, so there were fewer transactions, and the market was relatively stable. Dujian rice remained consistently flat. There were quite a few retail sales in the four villages, and the price was similar to the previous day. Although the inflow of Bian Yuan was not prosperous, the digestion was extremely stagnant, so the situation continued to soften, down a small two jiao yesterday, with high-quality goods opening at the 16 yuan mark. The Bian Yuan situation was stable. The goods arriving were all sporadic, and were mostly sold immediately. The market saw little gain or loss.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Guest Rice Inflow and Sales Both Active <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>▲ Yangmi: Tianjin Gang Handles Loading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the guest rice continued to arrive at the port. Nanjing rice was continuously transported by train. After this, there is still a hope for a large number of continued arrivals, so the market is more sluggish and soft. Fortunately, the Beiyang Gang purchased Hunan rice, the Ningbo Gang and Xiamen continued to purchase Jiangxi rice, and the townships in this street also inquired. The market was able to turn from fatigue to stability. After this, if the guest and local rice are continuously digested, then even if there are arrivals, the market can temporarily turn stable. The total market transaction was 300 bags of early Jiangxi machine rice, priced at 10 yuan 3 jiao to 9 yuan 5 jiao and a half. Also, more than 100 bags of late machine rice, priced at 11 yuan 8 jiao and a half. 400 bags of Nanjing machine rice, priced at 9 yuan 3 jiao. Also, 350 bags of brown rice, priced at 7 yuan 4 jiao 3 fen. 200 bags of Hunan machine rice, priced at 14 yuan 6 jiao. Also, 100 bags of Jinggang machine rice, priced at 10 yuan 0 jiao 7 fen. At present, Hunan rice has been sold out. After this, goods are not cost-effective, and there will be no temporary source, only car roads and Jiangxi goods may continue to arrive. Since a batch of Yang rice arrived from Saigon, there has been no transaction due to improper prices. Yesterday, the Tianjin Gang picked out 200 bags of No. 1, priced at 12 yuan and a half, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Wheat Market Nearly Flat, Far Term Falls <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, the current month followed the spot wheat turning machine, and the market appeared to be quite stable. However, the far-term months saw foreign wheat report a sharp decline again, and the sentiment was weak. In addition, manufacturers and customers sold as much as possible, so the opening immediately saw a sharp decline. In the afternoon, it was even weaker. Before the close, the far-term months all fell to 4 taels and 4 qian and a half. Compared to the previous day's closing price, the January to March months each fell by 6 fen, and the December month also fell by 5 fen. The current month was better by 1 fen. The next month fell by 2 fen following the far-term month. The spot wheat was originally expected to decline due to large inventories. Yesterday, Fufeng Factory picked out high-quality products, and high-quality Shandong white wheat recovered by 5 fen. The remaining wheat was flat. It is estimated that a total of 4,000 bags of Shandong Yaowan, Jiangbei Mingguang, and other wheat were delivered. Qifen was closed for one day because the vice chairman of the flour office, Xu Wenbin, passed away, and the members of the office commemorated Mr. Xu as the founder of the office, it is said.</p>

<p>▲ Large Transactions in Bowl Green</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's origin telegrams: Cuban spot sugar and New York sugar futures had no market news. Java spot sugar also saw no rise or fall. The public association's raw sand white buying sentiment was still quiet. The new cargo price was still 7 taels 9 qian and a half. Ma fine sand white was 8 taels. No. 20 medium sand white was 7 taels 1 qian. Inquiries were few, and the market was bleak and lacking energy. No. 9 Dutch red was 6 taels 4 qian, and the market was also stable. Japanese sugar transactions were sporadic, and the price saw a gradual decline. N Mark was 7 taels 9 qian. J Mark was 8 taels 1 qian 2 fen and a half. YP Mark was 8 taels 0 fen 5 qian. YT Mark was 7 taels 7 qian 7 fen and a half. YRO Mark was 7 taels 5 qian. The market was declining and depressed. The Hao Pan had Hua Xin Hao sell several hundred bags of Bowl Qing sugar, priced at 6 taels and 2 qian. Bing Chang Hao sold 1,000 bags of new goods, priced at 6 taels and 4 qian. The market was stable and elegant.</p>

<p>Xiang Lotus Root has been arriving successively in recent days, in small numbers. According to local sources, Changde lotus needs 40 yuan. The market is tired because of Hong Kong and Guangdong both buying is not active. Only a few transactions happened from Ningbo and the local inland areas, with very few bulk purchases. Yesterday, the Xiangtan lotus root was sold for 41 taels, Raozhou, Hengzhou, Jiuxi, and other goods were 38 or 9 taels, Changde lotus was 35 taels, and White Lotus was 36 taels.</p>

<p>European and American markets cannot afford the sales of Chinese silk factories. Yesterday morning, the Shanghai White Silk Factory still rarely transferred goods to Shanghai via telegram. Speculators found it difficult to transfer goods smoothly due to the low price. Yesterday, only Jardine Matheson and others imported 40 bales of Shanghai White Silk Factory silk. Birckhing imported 15 bales of yellow silk. Prices are said to remain firm.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Zhejiang Province Autumn Cocoons Inventory Will Be Cleared <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>This year's autumn cocoon harvest in various prefectures of Zhejiang Province was poor. The autumn cocoons collected by silk cocoon merchants in Shanghai were dried and transported to the railway station, ready to be shipped to Shanghai. However, due to the railway bureau's lack of vehicles, they had to switch to waterways, hiring barges and small steamers to transport them in batches. Most of the bulk has already been shipped to Shanghai. There are still a small number of dried cocoons stored in various railway station warehouses, waiting for the railway bureau to allocate vehicles for loading and transportation. In recent days, more than 700 bales have been transported to Chang'an and other stations. It is now found that the autumn dried cocoons stored in Gengshanmen, Chang'an, Xiashi, Jiaxing and other stations in Zhejiang Province are less than 2,000 bales, which should be cleared within a few days.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Qining Silk and Tea Had Impetus Yesterday <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of black tea from the Qining and other routes showed some impetus. Baochang, Tongfu and other firms, as well as the China Tea Company, have also begun to place orders due to the opening of Russian firms. However, the market has been stagnant for a long time, with a remaining inventory of 40,000 to 50,000 boxes. Chinese tea merchants are eager to sell, and are willing to lower prices repeatedly to seek sales, offering prices that are twenty to thirty taels lower than before. As for the green tea market, there has been no significant progress. For the Chun Mee variety, except for the high-grade goods with carefully selected buds that have seen some sales, the rest are sluggish. There have been no large transactions for Gongxi and inclined eyebrow teas.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Miscellaneous Items: Pepper and Tapioca Starch Show Different Trends <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>▲Pepper: In recent days, the business from customer routes has gradually started. Groups such as Sichuan and Hankou have all made purchases. The previously arrived inventory has gradually thinned out. Moreover, overseas telegrams indicate that the producing market is also firmer than before. Therefore, the firms are tightening their holdings and selling at higher prices, so the market quotations have suddenly become more positive. Yesterday's market quotations offered white silver pepper at 67-68 taels, black big pepper at 46.5 taels, and No. 1 pepper at 46 taels.</p>
<p>▲Tapioca Starch: Arrivals are strong, and market prices are trending downward. Yesterday's quotations offered No. 1 Flying Unicorn at 11 taels and 2 mace, No. 2 Green Pagoda, Three Fish, National Flag, etc. at 8 taels 6 candareens to 8 taels 3 or 4 candareens, and No. 3 Black Three Shrimp at 5 taels 1 candareen, each falling by 3 to 5 candareens compared to the previous quotations. However, the firms' appetite for purchases is still good.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Metals: Black Iron Sheets from Tianjin and Qingdao Are Selling Well <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Black iron sheets have recently been in demand, and various groups are actively purchasing them. As a result, the market's supply is scarce, and standards are rising steadily. Currently, 3'x6' sheets can be estimated at 9 taels 2 mace 5 candareens, and 2'x6' sheets (18 sheets) can be estimated at 10 taels 0 mace 7 candareens 5 candareens. However, as the local market prices in Tianjin, Qingdao and other places differ significantly, there are fewer purchases from those locations. In the past few days, due to the shortage of goods in the local market, and the resurgence of sales in those groups' locations, they have restarted searching for supplies. Therefore, even though it was raining continuously yesterday, the transaction volume still reached over 1,000 piculs. Prices for 3'x6' sheets opened at 9 taels, and 2'x6' sheets (18 sheets) at 10 taels 0 mace 5 to 8 candareens.</p>

<h3 id="e198">World Road Association Solves the Problem of Automobile Accidents <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>▲Promulgated Five Measures ▲Unanimously Accepted by All Countries</p>
<p>Vehicle congestion and automobile accidents are the most serious problems at present. All countries feel the seriousness, but in fact, it is still difficult to remedy. Now, this difficult problem has been substantially resolved. The organization that solved this difficult problem is the World Road Association, which held its meeting in Washington this May.</p>
<p>The World Road Association is dedicated to discussing facts and does not indulge in empty talk. At its first and second congresses, it drafted the automobile restriction law and immediately sent it to various countries for use. As a result, since 1926, twenty-three countries have implemented and adopted it. The number of other large cities that have done so is even more difficult to count. Therefore, in the first chapter of the opening statement, considerable respect must be paid to the World Road Association.</p>
<p>This year's congress has made even more progress. Its greatest achievement is the drafting and revision of three types of regulations. The first is a uniform automobile law (for government use), the second is a model municipal traffic law (for use by various cities), and the third is a unified book of traffic signals and other signs. These three books are naturally another great contribution to the world. On the opening day of the meeting, the U.S. Secretary of Commerce, who was also the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Raymond, delivered a speech. He said, "Regarding the problem of automobile transportation, the number of messages sent to the Department of Commerce every day is like snowflakes, and as serious as war bulletins. In terms of automobile accident statistics, in the United States alone, there were 12,500 cases in 1920, which increased to 22,000 cases in 1925, 28,000 cases in 1928, and as many as 31,000 cases in 1929. Let us analyze it further. In 1920, there were 136 fatalities per 1,000 vehicles. In 1925, there were only 110 vehicles, and in 1926, there were 107 vehicles. It can be seen that although the total number of accidents increased, the ratio decreased. However, after 1926, the situation changed again. Last year (1929), the ratio increased to 117 vehicles.</p>
<p>"The ratio is indeed high. However, the degree of increase is not drastic. We have adopted considerable methods. What are the methods? First. The most serious train accidents at railroad crossings. We use various methods, such as improving public education and strengthening publicity. Second. Children are the most easily hit because they are innocent and do not know the dangers. However, we promote safety education in schools. Outside the school gate, we stipulate that they must be picked up and dropped off by adults. In this way, in the past seven years, the rate of children being hit has increased by less than 25%. Third. We have established a statistical committee. Each province will unify the accidents. Submit them for classification and research to find ways to remedy them. Fourth. Most importantly, all cities can understand the seriousness of the vehicle situation. I am from Chicago. Take Chicago as an example. There have been significant results in rescuing vehicle accidents and solving vehicle congestion. In 1929, automobile accidents decreased by 2% compared to 1928. The situation in the other fourteen cities, including San Francisco, St. Louis, Milwaukee, etc., is better than before.</p>
<p>The above is the chairman's report on the situation in the United States. Let's look at the resolutions of the World Road Association. There are five main categories. First, the implementation of vehicle affairs laws and regulations. Second, the education law for road users. Third, vehicle accident statistics. Fourth, the construction and maintenance of vehicle laws. Fifth, road equipment laws, etc. Regarding the first resolution, this article can discuss. The remaining four items will be discussed later.</p>
<p>When it comes to implementing vehicle affairs laws and regulations, the conference believes that most accident problems have a considerable amount of clues. Take the crossing road accidents as an example. Most of them are caused by the lack of signal equipment at the crossings. Therefore, considerable attention has been paid to this point in unifying the automobile law. Looking at the automobile owner's accident, there are only a few reasons. The most important is violating the traffic law. This must be strictly dealt with by the police law. Secondly, ignoring the "left-hand driving law". It is clear that one should drive on the left, but in places where there is no one, they drive around without any consideration. Therefore, the law also stipulates that it is strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>The most important thing is the conclusion of the conference. It said, "To remedy the problem of vehicle accidents, it is not only necessary to rely on the vehicle affairs law. It is necessary to have the assistance of police officers. If it is found that it is not legal, it will be sanctioned without any favoritism. Secondly, it is necessary to get the sympathy of the court. Now a accident case. The court takes it very lightly. A few dollars fine and a few days in prison must be completed. How can this kind of understatement eliminate the carelessness of the car owner? Therefore, this point should be asked for the court's assistance. Third. There must be self-awareness of the people. Why do you say that? For example, the people themselves come out to organize a committee. It specializes in supervising the court's adjudication of the municipal government. If there is any discrepancy, it represents the public opinion and makes a formal request and suggestion. Only in this way can we cooperate and have hope."</p>
<p>It is said that the representatives of all countries gladly agreed to the above suggestions.</p>
<h3 id="e199">By-products of the Ford Factory <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>▲ No Waste in the Factory</p>
<p>Ford is a leading American automobile manufacturer. In recent years, its business has expanded daily, and its profits have increased significantly, showing great promise. However, the reason for Ford's development lies solely in its proper management and effective operation. In the Ford factory, whether it be the main factory or branch factories, there is no waste. Its management method is truly excellent. The income from by-products alone is particularly astonishing.</p>
<p>According to Ford factory statistics, comparing 1929 with 1928 in terms of by-products alone, 1929 saw an increase of $2,570,100 in revenue. The total by-product income for 1928 was $16,774,672, while for 1929 it was $19,344,373. This report was issued by the factory, so it is quite reliable. In these times of fierce commercial warfare, the success or failure of a business depends solely on proper management. The increase in by-product revenue at the Ford factory in recent years not only reduces all expenses but also lowers the value of its products. There is no waste in the factory that is discarded and not used. Utilizing waste is a win-win situation.</p>
<p>There is no waste in the Ford factory, as mentioned above. The sole purpose of various raw materials is to manufacture automobiles, which is known to all. However, in addition to manufacturing automobiles, countless by-products can be generated, either to be sold in the market or transported to branch factories for use. Last year, the revenue from the sale of by-products alone exceeded $19,000,000. In addition, the value of various by-products used by the Ford factory itself should also be in the millions of dollars. Last year, the most profitable by-product for sale was various scrap materials, with a total value of $5,672,000, an increase of $2,053,000 compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Among the various by-products produced by the Ford factory last year, coal sales were valued at over $2,758,000. Ford has coal mining factories in Kentucky and West Virginia for its own use. In addition to its own use, coal is sold to others. Some is transported by rail to coal merchants across the central United States for sale, while some is shipped from the DeRouge Ford docks for use in branch factories in the Northwest. Within the coal mines, the Ford factory can also obtain by-products</p>
<h2>Page 29</h2>
<p>Coal tar. Last year, the total value was over $4,313,000. From the coal tar, 825,000 dollars' worth of ammonium chloride was extracted, which was actively promoted by Ford factory dealerships in various locations. This type of hydrochloric acid has become widely used recently. The light oil used when extracting coal tar can also yield hydrocarbons, which are used in the Detroit oil stations. Last year, sales of this product amounted to $2,357,000.</p>
<p>In the lumber mills that Ford established in northern Michigan, all wood chips and sawdust are distilled to obtain by-products such as charcoal and chemical products. Last year, the sales of charcoal alone amounted to $509,000, an increase of $147,000 compared to the previous year. Other materials such as rubber, cork, and artificial leather also saw an increase in revenue of $237,000 last year, with total sales of $561,000.</p>
<p>Iron slag and iron filings from the coal furnaces can be refined into Portland cement. Last year, sales of this amounted to $1,032,000. Other iron filings were purchased for road construction, totaling $169,000. The remaining gas was sold to a gas company in Detroit, generating $373,000 last year. Scraps of glass manufactured by the factory itself were sold for $579,000. The wood chips sold by the Michigan lumber mill amounted to $36,000. Johnson rules are produced in large quantities, with sales of $102,000 last year. These rules are made of metal and are widely used in countries around the world and are recognized by the U.S. Bureau of Standards as a standard measure. Ford initially intended to use them internally, but recently, they have been produced in excess, so they have been put up for sale. From the above, it can be seen that the annual by-product income of the Ford Motor Company is considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e200">The Development of Automobile and Road Industries in Soviet Russia <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Gan</p>
<p>▲ 100,000 Automobiles Manufactured Annually</p>
<p>The total length of roads in Soviet Russia is currently three million kilometers, but only a small number of them are suitable for driving automobiles. According to statistics, it is no more than 50,000 kilometers. Therefore, the road conditions in various regions, cities, suburbs, and villages in Soviet Russia can be inferred from the above overview to get a general idea.</p>
<p>Given this situation, the roads in Soviet Russia must be reformed soon. It can be asserted that people in Soviet Russia now have a very common feeling that industrial center areas and densely populated areas must have suitable automobile roads. Currently, due to the lack of good roads in Soviet Russia, the total number of automobiles, including buses and trucks, is only over 21,000. Due to the lack of good roads, the automobile industry cannot develop. The scarcity of automobile production and the lack of emphasis on road issues are mutually causal. However, recently, there is a new organization in Soviet Russia called the Automobile Road Association, whose purpose is to realize the rapid advancement of both automobiles and roads.</p>
<p>This Automobile Road Association is exerting all its strength to awaken the people of Soviet Russia to pay attention to the construction of roads and the use of automobiles. The headquarters is located in Moscow, and there are branches everywhere. In terms of office work, the headquarters and branches are in contact with each other. The first goal of the association is to complete one million kilometers of paved roads and four and a half million kilometers of gravel roads within ten years. It is natural that this road construction will take place in densely populated areas, and its effectiveness can be anticipated.</p>
<p>In 1929, the Moscow Province designated 5,411,000 rubles to build major roads in the city of Moscow, and another 10,240,000 rubles were allocated for the construction of new roads throughout the province. Moscow began to have a public bus system in 1925, and today it has become an indispensable tool for public transportation and transport. At the end of 1928, there were 160 buses in Moscow, but this number was still in short supply. Moreover, due to narrow streets and crowded pedestrians, the buses found it very difficult to operate. According to the new plan for 1929, many new vehicles were added, and many roads were expanded. Currently, one and a half percent of the roads in Soviet Russia are gravel roads, a small number are paved stone roads, but the rest are mud roads with very simple construction.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia now plans to manufacture large numbers of automobiles to meet urgent needs. According to the plan of the Automobile Road Association, the annual automobile production must reach as many as 100,000 vehicles. If the needs of roads cannot advance in parallel with the needs of automobiles, then that is contrary to common sense. Therefore, in addition to good roads, the people of Soviet Russia are also gradually expanding the use of trucks and buses to facilitate transportation. Under these circumstances, in the next five years, Soviet Russia's attention to road construction will be even greater than in other countries around the world. Government officials know that the construction of good automobile roads is much cheaper than the construction of railways, and the benefits are also greater than those of railways. The road construction engineers have mostly returned from abroad, understand all kinds of benefits, and have sufficient experience. The Soviet government is very willing for foreign tourists to travel to its various regions and knows that good roads and automobile travel are the greatest assistance for this endeavor.</p>
<p>In the next few years, one thing that will occupy an important position in road development is the development of combined agricultural land. It is obvious that railway lines cannot reach large farms of 500,000 or 1,000,000 mu. Therefore, trucks for agricultural use will be used extensively. The economic and practical nature of automobile transportation and the promotion of state farms mean that good roads will solve all agricultural transportation needs. As for the progressive spirit of the leaders of the Automobile Road Association, their completion of the national road plan is even more certain.</p>
<h3 id="e201">Service as the Key to Commerce <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ren</p>
<p>▲ The Vanguard of Promoting Goods ▲ What the Automobile Industry Should Focus On</p>
<p>Business and trade, both buyers and sellers, all consider the deal done once the goods are exchanged, with no further responsibility. This has been the state of business for thousands of years. In recent years, with the development of industry and commerce and the intensification of competition, in order to expand business and attract customers, it is necessary to cater to the psychology of customers and obtain customer satisfaction. This is nothing other than service.</p>
<p>Even a few years ago, automobile transactions were the same. The manufacturer sold the vehicle to the buyer, and if the engine was free from defects and the driving was smooth, the responsibility was complete. The car owner, having obtained the car and feeling satisfied, had no other requests.</p>
<p>In recent years, the business situation has changed greatly, and business is becoming increasingly difficult. Car owners who purchase a car not only seek excellent engine performance at the time of purchase but also require a guarantee of long-term service in the future, so that the capital invested will yield full benefits. Therefore, manufacturers have no choice but to follow the psychology of car owners and establish branches, service stations, repair stations, and parts warehouses around the world to engage in service and expand business. Therefore, an additional expense is added, which is also very large.</p>
<p>The most perfect automobile service in the world today is the General Motors Corporation, the largest in the world. The scale is unparalleled. The factory now has branches in 114 countries, and there are service stations in various locations. Today, there are more than seven million General Motors cars on the road, which shows how prevalent they are. According to Mr. McDonald, the service director of the Shanghai branch of the factory in China, service is not only the responsibility of the car dealership but also an essential element in promoting vehicles. Car owners who receive perfect service are satisfied and spread the word, which is more effective than advertising. Promotion is more effective than talking.</p>
<p>Today, General Motors car owners, wherever they go, can carry their cars without worry. There is always a General Motors manager's service station nearby to provide repairs and service by specialists. The General Motors Corporation is deeply aware of the close relationship between service and business. It spares no expense to establish service stations for each car and has parts directors, service directors, and representatives who constantly communicate and discuss with managers and cooperate with each other. At the same time, it founded the General Motors Service School to train specialists to serve the Chinese people in the future. Its forward-thinking design and thorough service can be a model for the automobile industry.</p>

<p>▲ Mr. Odlum is Very Satisfied with its Use as a Means of Transportation</p>
<p>Mr. Robert Odlum, owner of the Dollar Steamship Company, arrived in Shanghai on the President Grant. On the same ship was the first batch of 1931 Chrysler eight-cylinder cars, which are currently on display in the showroom of the Mackie Motors Company at the corner of Szechuan Road and Edward Road.</p>
<p>After the car arrived in Shanghai, Mr. Mackie personally drove and invited Mr. Odlum to take a test drive. Mr. Odlum praised the new car highly, saying, "I have never seen a more beautiful car than this. I have never ridden in a more comfortable car than this."</p>
<p>This new Chrysler eight-cylinder car is one of the two major exports of the Chrysler factory this year, including features such as elegance, beauty, richness, engineering improvements, and increased speed.</p>
<p>In addition, there are various features not commonly seen on automobiles, which are all the crystallization of the time and skills of Chrysler's exclusive engineers. The Chrysler sedan currently on display in the showroom has a dark blue body, with unique fenders, a radiator that can be opened and closed, and all-metal spare tire racks.</p>
<p>A new Chrysler Royal eight-cylinder car will also arrive in Shanghai soon. The above two cars have reached the peak of engineering. All of Chrysler's famous acceleration, power, economy, driving convenience, comfort, and durability are further enhanced.</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, at Mr. Odlum's request, Mackie Motors has specially allocated a new car for Mr. Odlum's use as a means of transportation during his stay in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e203">Talking About the Current Situation of Long-Distance Buses in Guangzhou <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Ren</p>
<p>Since the active development of Guangzhou, transportation has become more convenient, and long-distance buses travel back and forth. However, the exact number of vehicles and their current situation are rarely known. Because the matter concerns the city's transportation, the author conducted a detailed investigation and recorded it in this column to inform readers.</p>
<p>Among the long-distance buses in Guangzhou that have been put into operation, in addition to city-operated vehicles and reserve vehicles from various companies, there are the Guomin, Limin, Fuli, Lihang, Tongxing, Mofan, Guangdong, Guangzhou, Baida, and Jiaotong companies, totaling 67 vehicles. Companies in the planning stage include the Zhonghua, Yangcheng, and Anmin companies, each with 10 vehicles, scheduled to run on the lines from Zhongshan Park to Lizhiwan, Sun Yat-sen University to Longjin Bridge, and Zhongshan Park to Daiheji. It is found that except for the Guangzhou, Mofan, and Tongxing companies, which can barely support themselves, the rest are in an unstable state. The reasons for the losses are roughly twofold. The gasoline and parts for the automobiles are all dependent on foreigners. Recently, the price of gold has skyrocketed, and the impact has been that the prices of all goods have risen. The price of gasoline has more than doubled compared to before. Moreover, the number of free-riding passengers is unparalleled elsewhere. Therefore, seats are often full, but there are few ticket sellers. Ticket revenue has also been greatly affected.</p>

<p>Chevrolet has manufactured its seven millionth vehicle this year. The six millionth milestone was reached in June last year, just ten months and twenty-five days ago. The number of vehicles has rapidly increased by one million. It is estimated that the Chevrolet factory can produce an average of 300 vehicles per day. It has always ranked first in the automobile manufacturing industry. The seven millionth Chevrolet sedan was driven out of the factory by the factory owner, Knutsen, himself.</p>

<h3 id="e206">London to Hold Automobile Exhibition <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Ping Baoshan</p>
<p>London, England, will hold the world's largest automobile exhibition in the middle of next month. Products from seven other countries will be displayed inside to compete. British manufacturers are taking this action in the hope of expanding their overseas market and seeking smooth sales.</p>
<p>About 74 automobile manufacturing companies are participating in this unprecedented event, but the United Kingdom accounts for the largest number.</p>
<p>The United States has the second largest number of exhibits. France, Italy, Germany, Belgium, and Austria are next, and they will all inevitably lower their prices.</p>
<p>The cheapest car will be British, valued at 125 pounds, while the most expensive will be a German sample, reaching 3,000 pounds per vehicle.</p>
<p>The rest of the British products are priced lower than the same American vehicles. This is nothing more than advertising.</p>
<h3 id="e207">New Invention in Automobile Engineering <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The diagram shows a new safety device called Sure Gard and how it communicates with the insurance stem, but as soon as the insurance stem is subjected to pressure, it can cut off the current. Two copper springs make contact, and the car stops abruptly. When the insurance stem touches an external object and the current stops, a spark in the electric ring causes this device to operate and automatically stall the engine.</p>
<p>This device can also be operated by installing an insurance button on the dashboard inside the car. If the driver anticipates danger ahead, pressing this button will stop the car much faster than using the foot brake or hand brake. At the same time, it does not conflict with the original brake. In crowded areas, where there is fear of accidentally colliding with the car in front and stopping, this device can be temporarily turned off. When parking, the current in the insurance stem can be connected to the horn to warn other drivers when needed.</p>

<h3 id="e208">Bad Driving Habits <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Luo</p>
<p>When doing anything, it is important to lay a good foundation and develop good habits from the beginning, so that you can be spared a lot of trouble in the future.</p>
<p>Driving is related to the lives of oneself and others. Extra care should be taken. Driving a car seems very simple, but it is not easy to drive properly and legally. Constant practice is required. Developing good driving habits will prevent any danger and reduce many costs. There are many bad driving habits. Here are a few of the most common ones:</p>
<p>(2) Driving too fast. The engine operates too violently.</p>
<p>(1) Uneven acceleration. Randomly using the accelerator.</p>
<p>(3) If the star plug is clogged with dust, gasoline consumption increases by about 20%.</p>
<p>(4) Starting too abruptly. Rushing into intersections.</p>
<p>(5) Instant braking. Damages the brake system and is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>(6) Using first or second gear for too long. The speed and action are weakened as a result.</p>
<p>Drivers often do not pay attention to things like this, which can damage the engine, hinder movement, cause danger, increase costs, and cause endless troubles. According to the advice of Mr. McDonald (service director of General Motors Corporation), any slight damage to the engine should be repaired immediately. This can save a lot of trouble. In addition, the engine should be inspected frequently to maintain the normal state of the parts and prevent accidents.</p>
