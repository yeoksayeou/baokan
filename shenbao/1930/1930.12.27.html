<h3 id="c6">耶誕節之商市談 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>美國紐約之耶誕節。因銀行突起停閉風潮。大爲減色。一反從前歡欣鼓舞之象。德國柏林之耶誕節。商業遠遜於往年。遊人亦减少。英倫之耶誕節、極爲寂寥、爲從來所未有、澳洲之耶誕節、貿易甚爲清淡、較諸一九二九年僅及其半。零售店多銷廉價物品。價稍貴者幾無人過問。即此耶誕節一事。而各國商業之凋零。人民購買力之竭蹶。與夫世界人心之不安定。皆可於此見之矣。此可深爲世界悲觀者也。</p>
<p>世界社之倫敦訊。史學大家魏爾斯氏。近在英國弭兵討論會演說。謂上次大戰後世人預料當有二十五年之小休。然以現在之國際狀况言之。恐無如是之長期休息。二次大戰或即於一二年内爆發。根本消弭戰爭之方法。惟有兵不願戰而已。然而今日之人心。已非如大戰甫畢時之人心。當大戰甫畢之時、人人鑒於大戰之犧牲鉅大。驚心動魄於兵禍之慘痛。無一不思休養生息於太平無事之下。故和平空氣油然以生於此而再授以兵。驅之作戰吾知其决乎不願也。今則爲此經濟潮流所壓迫。非特失業者無以圖存。即小有職業。亦幾難以維持其生活。向所希望之休養生息。今旣成爲泡影而不可得於是不得不轉其希望於無生路中求生路。故在今日而再授以兵。驅之作戰。則不敢斷言其不願矣。於此而欲消弭戰爭亦實無法。蓋此非人心好戰。亦非思亂。而實有一種不可思議之惡運以迫之於後。誰有大力以挽救之耶。吾因今次耶誕節之冷淡而不禁深有所感焉。</p>

<p>敎育消息特載</p>
<h3 id="c149">江蘇省立實小聯合會兒童生活指導組研究報告（二） <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>B、以自治爲課外活動在許多人以爲兒童的活動、可分爲課内和課外兩種活動、課内的活動、拿敎材做中心、課外的活動拿事業做中心總之兒童自治認爲課外的活動、</p>
<p>其實兒童的活動、是整個的、旣没有課外、又没有課内、導師何必要憑着論理的頭腦成人的眼光去强分兒童的整個活動爲課内與課外呢　如兒童秋季遠足的活動他搜集的禁本、畫的寫生盡、記的日記、寫的游記、這許多活動有的在外做的、有的在校内做的、這種一直線下來的活動怎樣去分他做課内課外呢、</p>
<p>C、兒童自治是預備將來的吾们不能預先憑着成人的頭腦、論理的眼光以社會目標爲根據、規定了許多模型在工廠化的學校裡、照樣製造可憐在這種模型式的訓練之下不知犧牲了多少活潑潑的兒童、也不知戕賊了多少富有個性的小友、</p>
<p>（二）、組織上的病態</p>
<p>A實際方面太重表面、當兒童爲一種學校的裝飾品你無論何時　進無論那一隻學校、一定可以看見些兒童自治的佈置和兒童自治的氣味、名稱上有什麽會、什麽村、可以聽見、佈置上一定有幾張關於兒童自治的表格和標說可以看見、活動上一定有似上崗而非上崗的巡察員、在崗位那裡胡閙的活劇可以碰到</p>
<p>倘使有興味而多站一刻兒、一定還有許多的矯揉造作的自治活動、表現在你的眼簾、</p>
<p>假使再有興味向當局去詢問詢問關於兒童自治的問題一定有意想不到的、崇高偉大的計劃和方針、振動你的耳膜</p>
<p>B排列方面、各學校組織、大家要周到而完密、整齊而　一、但是自治組織愈完密、愈犯着論理化的毛病愈整齊、愈犯着機械化的弊病、所以現在般的組織、排列方面犯着兩種大毛病、就是排列機械化和論理化、</p>
<p>（三）實施上的病態</p>
<p>A忘却自治係兒童爲本位、認自治的對象爲訓育、忘却了兒童、所以舉凡自治的設施組織和指導都不能以兒童爲本位、置兒童於被動的地位所以有許多活動多係機械化了、活動自活活、兒童自兒童雖然活動而兒童本身、也是莫明其妙</p>
<p>D不根據（兒童需要丨兒童自治的各項活動、一定要根據兒童的需要、那末、那種活動、方才有價值、可是各學校大多爲自治組織完密和周詳起見、不顧兒童的需要、規定了各種活動、訂立了詳細的章程計劃了各種的辦法、然後呌兒童去活動、請問這種活動、在敎育上有多大的價值呢、</p>
<p>（三）兒童生活指導理論的基礎</p>
<p>敎育即生活、生活即敎育吾們對於這種病態百出的兒童自治、應當宣告他的死刑、最低限度、也希望他上一點（壽終正寢）、</p>
<p>吾們主張要使兒童跟着他們的生活、逹到各人的成就、吾們不主張用手段去敎兒童、也不願意用方術去驅兒童、</p>
<p>吾們要在兒童整個的活動裡、發現些　會目標不願意預備了　會目標拿兒童去製造一個人或幾個人的理想型</p>
<p>吾們祗知道敎育即是生活、生活即是敎育、爲達到這裡目的起見盡力地深入兒童活動的中心、力謀兒童生活的發展、</p>
<p>現在把生活化的意味和領域、下個深刻的檢討、再把人類的生活下個精確的分析在這檢討和分析之下、就可以看到兒童生活指導産生的發源</p>
<p>然而再將生活指導的方法、加以詳細的說明、生活指導的目標也加以審愼的訂立在這方法和目標的說明和訂立之下、就可以看到生活指導活動的指南</p>
<p>（一）生活指導的意味丨丨現在的敎育園地裡、生活與敎育、處於分離的非常然態之下、覺得敎育的全部失其活氣、故敎育與生活理當結合敎育旣佔着生活的全部所以全部的敎育具有生活化的意味、</p>
<p>敎育以生活爲其對象、生活指導、就是使兒童現在的生活無限量的向上發展、所以生活、不應離敎育而敎育也不能離生活、</p>
<p>現在病態的兒童自治活動遠離生活、生活不能做活動的中心、無怪兒童自治充滿着機械化的意味、</p>
<p>（二）生活指導的領域丨丨生活的領域、其對象可　於生活的全部、其内容也包括人生生活的全部在時間方面、有過去、現在和將來三位一體的生活用空間來講、有家庭學校社會、三位一體的關係兒童過去的生活就是家庭、現在的生活、就是學校將來的生活、就是社會、所以兒童整個生活活動中、生活指導的領域、要聯絡道去的家庭生活、充實現在的學校生活發展將來的社會生活但現在的學校、與家庭離異、和　會　絶這種無根據、不切實的敎育、怎　呌他有活氣呢、</p>
<p>（三）生活指導的人生活動分析丨丨吾們把人類生活根據現代各敎育家的歸納人生活動的方法、先行研究一下做個參考、當代研究課程的專家、以巴必得、孫恃惠、班羅蘭爲馬首、他們歸納人生活　的方法如下、</p>
<p>（甲）巴必得把人生活動歸納成爲五方面、</p>
<p>（一）語言活動</p>
<p>（二）職業活動</p>
<p>（三）健康活動</p>
<p>（四）公民活動</p>
<p>（五）休間活動</p>
<p>巴氏的意思、以語言是佔着生活全部中很重要的地位、所以歸納爲人生一大活動</p>
<p>其實在學校的全部生活中、言語的活動、機會很多、並且隨時在各種活動中、可以學到語言的、</p>

<p>戰爭之經過　法國將與波蘭。比國。捷克。巨哥斯拉夫。羅馬尼亞等國連合人數約一千二百萬義國戕與德·匃·奥英等國連合。惟人數約僅十八萬戰爭約六星期。法·波等國大勝。當大戰之第一夜。法波·捷克等國之炸彈飛機。將德國最重要之大城悉數毁滅。而匃奥等國。亦復遭法波等國之蹂躪。且佔領鐵落耳地方并設軍政府焉法義兩國。將會師於德國南部之平原德國最重要之魯ＲＵＢＲ區域於開戰後。八日悉被法軍佔據。德政府將遷基耳ＫＩＥＬ。是處將有英兵登陸。以指揮德國北部軍事。或可免法軍鐵蹄之蹂躪也。開戰後第五星期。法義兩軍將决戰勝負乃定。</p>
<p>戰後之大戰　法·波等雖屬戰勝國家。然未能享勝利之福也。因蘇俄埋伏於後。將起大兵。人數約在六七億之間復有土耳其軍一億爲之助。波蘭與羅馬尼亞首當其衝。從波羅的海至亞德禮海之間。法俄將開始交綏當此之時人民備受戰爭痛苦。必羣起革命。美國亦受歐洲戰禍影響。戰事迭起全世界遂淪爲野蠻之域云</p>

<p>商權操諸女子。女子皆能識能算。勤潔愛美。故須知者。緬俗重女輕男。蓋倫理上女中心主義。女對家族父母。有盡孝義務。男子多人贅其家。故與緬女婚。須負其全家義務。不可不知。至其對男子輕視者。因男子長大。或當和尙而出家。或入贅而遠離。不能奉養父母。支持門户。故　視之也。其俗與中國恰相反。此雖非我所主張之坤化大同世。然雄性降伏。在緬甸雄性之暴力。可謂甚小也。而男旣入女家。則享受分産之權利。女家有財産。男子亦得享受之。恰似中人之娶婦然。已。愛好乃自殺根苗。</p>

<p>巡禮意大利日記</p>
<p>（三）羅馬十日（十）（五）</p>
<p>六月四歐游日大伽藍聖彼得丨梵諦剛敎皇宫丨西施庭敎堂丨</p>
<p>在這大伽藍的神殿裏低徊驚嘆了許久。我們才走過圓柱　廊。到後苑去訪問梵諦剛博物院我們未到博物院以前。又將敎王宫全部的規模看了一個大概。聳立在周圍的宫殿和崇樓。被羅馬的烈日所薰炙在乾透的青空之下。輝出稀有的金黃色而每一處閃耀裏。顯出了宗敎神聖的威嚴。在宫門左右分列了數重武裝的門衛。這門衛也太奇怪而俏皮了。個個都像上海戲台上所表演的（金錢豹）。穿着（紅）（黃）（綠）各色錯綜而不同的制服。又將青·赤·紅的布裏着腿項間帶着朝珠一般的金練。手裏拿着長予幹上施以朱紅尖端是雪亮的白銀。看上去煞是豪壯威武。這就是告訴我們敎王是凛然不可犯的。</p>
<p>沿敎王宫再走十多丈到了盡頭。就踏進這梵諦剛博物院了。立刻提起我研究的深味。這個博物院和羅馬其他的各博物院不同。進門是每人要五個利耳的門費。據說這是敎皇的收入。至羅馬凡是敎皇管轄的塲所。都要收費的。</p>
<p>進了門穿進長方形的走廊。參觀者　集塞道。此時我們的心中。只有焦急的期待。尤其是我眞似身入寳藏那樣的高興。這種興緻是生平所少有的。由石階上升爲廣廊。左右的壁上天頂上都描着色彩鮮明的聖母及基督的故事是一種膠畫的壁畫。兩旁的櫉内陳列着歷代敎皇御用的珍品。外國的贈品。埃及工藝品許多木彫的小像還有很多裝飾美術。浮雕。象牙彫嵌等。這大半是埃及希臘的數千年遺下的東西。我這時不暇一一詳考。只覺得在這開展的新的局面裏。没每一樣不令人驚奇還有内面的一室。也充滿着金銀寳玉的貴重品。還有許多宗敎上的文卷。四圍也是華麗不過的裝飾。壁上所描冩的旣不是天國。也不是地獄是極有生氣的動物（鴨）（鳩鴿）（孔雀）。或鮮美的葡萄。從這裏可知那美妙之源已經轉從到田野去級取。而注重觀察自然了。尤共可驚的凡些壁畫。的確很像中國古廟宇的壁畫。就是顔色用筆也有同樣的風味。惟其一些也不勉强。而是很自然的事。才令人可驚可異丁。</p>

<p>卓君庸的用筆九法</p>
<p>在現代文化發展情形之下、書法之欣賞也不得不換一種眼光、從大體上說來、現代所寫的字應以簡單以平正爲美、以容易寫以人人皆能寫爲合法、以能容納各種字體之優點爲盡其能事、換一句話說、就從前的人要有閒暇有力量的人才能寫好字、而現在可以呌人人都能寫好字、</p>
<p>所謂漢字决不是一定指近古通行的正楷而言、從現在的趨勢看、必然有一種新興的字體來應這種的要求、這種字體必然是很簡單很平正很容易認又容易寫的、留心文化事業的、必然已經聽見這種要求的呼聲了、</p>
<p>但是在這種新字體未通用以前、還需要一種改良書法的方法、供給目前的應用、爲什麽呢、現在通用的正楷、並不是不能寫好字來、却是被那班寫（烏光方）的字的人們寫壞了、書法之不講究在這幾十年中爲最甚、小學生從寫仿本時起、便寫的是當代館閣諸公的字還被刻字店刻成一個個極呆板極庸俗的樣子、一見没有不令人作已日嘔的、試想初學執筆的人、便從此等字入手、以後縱然想取法乎上、而習憤已成、還能再有多大的進步麽、所以寫字入手不得法、可以比方女人的自幼纏足、纏過足的人、就是再放足、走起路來還是不自然、寫過壞字的人、想掃盡以前的壞習慣、也就難了、這還是爲有志向上的說的、若是不研究書法的人、那就一輩子不會知道自已的壞處、近來國人寫字的退化從各種公衆地方都可以看出、試到大街上一看、兩旁的市招廣告等等金碧輝煌的大字、無論多麽華麗、而他的字體總是惡劣不堪入目的、惡劣的結果、便是不能引起人的注意、不能喚起人的美感、而且不容易使人辨識、這於商業上有多麽重大的損失呀、</p>
<p>日本與我國同文、可是大多數日本人的字都比我們寫的好、這没有别的原因、就是他們没纏過足、没寫過壞的仿本、他們從草書入手、用筆於唐帖爲近、並不是最好的方法、然而他的結果已比我們好的多了、書法之不講求、不但在社會應用上吃虧、就在兒童敎育上也成一個大問題呀、試想兒童的頭腦是何等寳貴的、别的學科都有了科學的敎授方法、可以用最簡便的方法得到最複雜的知識、惟有寫中國字還是用舊日不規則的方法施行强迫的注入、這對於兒童是何等的不幸啊、</p>
<p>無論什麽事情、没有不可以用科學方法來歸納的、所以改良書法的敎授以促成書法之進步、决不是不可能的、新近卓君庸先生作了一部用筆九法、便是應這種要求而産生的、他的基本方法是將各種繁複的用筆法歸成以下的九種（一）點、（二）横、（三）直、（四）左斜、（五）右斜、（六）左轉、（七）右轉、（八）左旋、（九）右旋、這九種筆法都是幾何的形體、如果再歸納起來、實在便只有四種、就是（一）點形、（二）線形、（三）角、（四）園、初學的人只要能用筆描寫這</p>
<p>四種形體、純熟得法、自然可以寫得好字了、</p>
<p>他這議論、初年看似乎太離奇、然而實有確不可移的道理、要知道中國字所以寫得好、並不在一個一個的字形結體、而在乎筆法、用筆合法則結體可以舉一反三、反之、若結體雖好而和筆不合法、仍</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>然不能成爲好字、所以根本在乎筆法、從前相傳的永字八法、頗有道理、然而太複雜了、不是初學可以入手的、而且專爲楷體而設、不適現代解放字體之用、據卓氏自已說、這九法可以包括龜甲籕篆隸章草楷行各項字體之筆法、熟習此九法以後、無論上列何種字體皆可書寫、這的確是本書的特殊精神所在、</p>
<p>小學生用此作仿本、至少可收下列的效果、（一）下筆一空倚傍、不爲俗體所拘束、最合兒童心理、横平豎直養成手眼相應之良習慣、（三）可以由此漸入高深、從事於篆隸草書、</p>
<p>不但兒童、即常人有志研究書法的亦可由此得簡捷之門徑、入門得法、只須臨墓一兩種碑帖、不患不能寫好字、不然縱使天天練習、如古人（池水盡黑）還是枉然、這種痛苦、想來嘗過的人也少少了、所以今日提倡書法、所最需要的不一定好的碑帖、而是好的簡便的入門方法、卓氏的書、確能適應這種需要、他的成功是可預卜的了、</p>

<p>爲了這事、我好幾次都想到自殺上面去了的、我想、這件戀愛無論如何、是不會成功的、我也不必胡思亂想了、還是自己勇敢一點、用手槍來將自己打死、就這樣算了吧、就這樣算了吧、</p>
<p>但是呀、包君、這話說起來是很容易的、可是實行起來那就困難了呀、我是否怕死、現在姑且不要去吧、但是、包君、你還是知道的、用手槍來打死自己、然而、手槍呢、我又從何處去弄得到手呢、没有、那又如何中夠打死自己呢、或者說說别的死法也可以、但是、包君、我旣然不能愛我所欲愛的人、則我的死也應當求一個偉大痛快的死、至於自縊、投水、那些原不過婦人小子行爲的、我是不屑而且不願做的呀、</p>

<p>鄒枋作草野花印行</p>
<p>在極形沉寂的中國詩壇上、我們能夠讀到香吻這樣長的抒情詩、確實使我們感到意外的欣喜、因爲最近的坊間、簡直没有關於詩歌一類的單集發行、即使像鳳毛麟角般的在沉寂的詩壇上顯露出一兩本所謂詩的單集、但是、可以使讀者感到分外滿意的、確是極少、甚其可以說是没有、這一點、實是中國詩壇没落的没有生氣的一種表徴、在愛了詩的人、當然是充滿了無限的悲慮、雖然、在不久之前、各種刋物上曾經注意於詩的選載、但是大都屬於口號標語的一類、使我們誦讀之下、祇有感覺到它底粗暴、恐佈、充滿了血腥的殺氣、旣没有藝術的表現、又没有技巧的專點可言、這些呐喊下來的詩篇、簡直忘記了所謂詩的本質與原素、這是誰也承認的事實、這集（香吻）裏的詩、却大大的不同、詩歌中應具有的熱烈的情感、豐富的想像、質樸的美的原素、它是所表現無遺的了、同時、作者技術也達到成熟的一點、這更其是在現今一般的詩歌裏所不能做到的、關於此、傅東華先生在這集子的序文裏得很詳細、是這樣的寫着、</p>
<p>若果像診脈一般把香吻裏的幾首詩　　靜氣凝神的按下去、便覺得其中是　　蓄火似的含着濃烈感情的、這樣的　　蓄火正是詩人的質素、别的人勉强　　不來、等到表現的技術再成熟些、這　　樣的質素便可發爲絢熟的藝術的印　　、所以我對於作者之爲詩人極有希　　望、</p>
<p>在這節簡短的序文裏、對於這首香吻的詩篇所具有的特長都分析得異樣的詳盡、如果我們再把原詩（靜氣凝神）的讀下去、更其覺得傳先生這話是極對的、不過作者之爲詩人、已經具有必備的條件、我們却不能加以否認、</p>
<p>而且、作者的思想很高超、這或許就</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>是詩人的思想、所以在他每一節詩的表現裏、都盡力的運用他那藝術的手腕、無論怎樣、是不使它落於平凡、這在普通的一般詩人所表現的、却没有這樣的新穎可喜、讀了這（香吻）的人總能得信無遺的、作者所寫、是有嚴整的秩序、全詩計分爲六個吻、在每個吻裏、又分下若干小節、但是一點也不嫌繁雜、祗使我們歌吟了之後、感到他所寫的秩序井然、這是極顯明的、作者所表現的、雖然是爲了愛的那物的、但是在另一方面、却充滿着向上的意識、這就是作者的偉大、是那些頽廢詩人所不能表現的、現在我們先看他所寫的吧、</p>
<p>你的雙頰不曾哦、染上嫣紅與白鉛、　　我愛這笑　、像百合花剛展了瓣、　　不關所盪漾的、是閒澹、還是欣喜、　　啊、許罷、容我再輕狂一番、</p>
<p>丨或者、欣喜、或者、閒澹、（第二個　　吻）</p>
<p>小姑娘、我愛你天眞、　　孩子和成人誰說兩樣、　　（兒童能進天國）、</p>
<p>你有否曾聆聞有人這樣講、究竟是　　上帝喜歡疾妒、</p>
<p>愛旣降生了、又陷了悲悵、</p>
<p>我簡直要毁滅自己、</p>
<p>不且待我三重新地思量、（第一個　　吻）、</p>
<p>像上例所徴引的兩節詩禮、我們可以看出作者是把着樂觀的、旣然是充滿了（欣喜）、當然前途是隱含着無限的希望、這實是作者具有活潑天眞的氣息、他愛自然、他又愛天眞燦爛的小姑娘、這無非是他愛護可貴的童年、希望努力向上之意、這即是一種象徴的筆緻、他雖然有時蜚悲悵、但是他總要對於這些加以一種新的估量、回到童年的新的境地、他在以下的幾節詩裏、所寫的（小孩子）的愛眞、尤爲淋漓盡緻、靈活可喜、但大都充滿着懽躍的、</p>
<p>斟一杯葡萄酒丨儘量醉飲儘量喝、　　樑、半載未逢今朝多麽難得、　　祝你有福、願我也有福、　　東西南北、齊充滿了忭躍、</p>

<p>我賀我自己、你慶我復活、</p>
<p>忭躍、忭躍、忭躍、（第四個吻）</p>
<p>像這兩節詩、所表現的是怎樣的有力、緊凑、新穎、使我們讀了、在靈活的内心引起無限的忭躍、這一點、是很值得注意的、概括的說、這集（香吻）是國内詩壇上新發現的一首不易多得的抒情詩、關於此趙景深先生在他序文裏說得很明澈不必要我再來詳加解說了、在我覺得、這（香吻）詩集推薦於讀者之前、是具有充分意義的呢、</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chairman Chiang's Telegram to All Provinces and Cities to Implement Abolition of Likin on Schedule <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Only Key to Completing the Revolution</p>
<p>Should Use the Spirit of Sacrifice to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>No Leniency for Evasive Language or Delays</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang telegraphed to the provincial governments and mayors on the afternoon of the 26th, saying: To all provincial government chairmen and mayors: Likin is the only corrupt policy that has harmed merchants and the people for decades in our country. Since the establishment of the National Government, it has long been considered for abolition, but it has been delayed until now due to various obstacles. It not only increases the burden on the people, hinders the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, but is also a major enemy of clean governance and the source of corruption for officials. Those who handle likin all regard embezzlement as commonplace and exploitation as their ability. Countless personnel, the beauty of palaces, and the service of wives and concubines all come from eroding national revenue and sucking the marrow of the people. Even comrades who hold political power, with the thought of helping the poor and destitute, do not hesitate to let beasts eat people and personally become the instruments of all evils. Therefore, if likin is not abolished, there is no way to purify the government, no way to rectify the people's hearts, no way to realize the Principle of People's Livelihood, and no way to complete the National Revolution. This time, after the plenary session of the Central Executive Committee, the National Government issued an order to abolish likin and all taxes and levies similar to likin on January 1, the 20th year of the Republic of China. No province may request an extension for any reason. This is the only key to whether the National Revolution can be completed. All provincial and municipal governments with a revolutionary spirit will certainly support the central government and do their best to eradicate this greatest corrupt policy that hinders the revolution. Recently, provincial and municipal governments have worried that revenue will sharply decrease and it will be difficult to compensate, especially since military reorganization is underway and the source of military pay should not be affected. It must be known that hardship and difficulty are the heavenly duty that the revolution must go through. If abolishing likin causes a shortfall in local government expenses, provincial and municipal governments should use the spirit of sacrifice to overcome the difficulties and jointly accomplish great things. Even if abolishing likin leads to insufficient military pay, it is firmly believed that all officers and soldiers of the true revolutionary army will be able to endure temporary pain for the greatest cause of saving the country and the people and completing the revolution, and will not have any objections. Since the late Qing Dynasty, there have been repeated attempts to abolish likin, but they failed because corrupt officials obstructed them with false words, and the government at that time had no real intention of relieving the suffering of the people. Now the central government is determined to remove this long-standing corrupt policy. No matter what difficulties, we dare not avoid them, and no matter what obstructions, we are not afraid. I, Chiang Kai-shek, must be determined to carry it out. I believe that everything can be sacrificed today, but the policy of abolishing likin must be implemented thoroughly and on schedule. Comrades in provincial and municipal governments should have the same determination as I do. In the event that there is anyone who obeys in appearance but defies in reality, uses evasive language and delays, to undermine the party and the country's great plan and hinder the completion of the revolution, the national law is in place and will not allow any leniency. Whether the abolition of likin can be earnestly implemented this time is the touchstone of revolution versus counter-revolution, warlords versus non-warlords. All my revolutionary comrades, please respectfully abide by this. Chiang Kai-shek. (Special telegram on the 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">A Discussion of the Christmas Market <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Christmas in New York, USA, was greatly diminished due to the sudden wave of bank closures. It was the opposite of the joyous atmosphere of the past. Christmas in Berlin, Germany, was far less commercial than in previous years, and the number of tourists also decreased. Christmas in England was extremely lonely, unprecedented. Christmas in Australia saw very sluggish trade, only half of what it was in 1929. Retail stores mostly sold cheap goods, and few people cared about items with slightly higher prices. From this Christmas event alone, we can see the decline of commerce in various countries, the exhaustion of people's purchasing power, and the instability of the world's people's hearts. This is deeply pessimistic for the world.</p>
<p>According to a report from the London office of the World Society, the great historian H.G. Wells recently gave a speech at a disarmament conference in England, saying that after the last world war, people expected a 25-year respite. However, given the current international situation, there may not be such a long rest period. A second world war may break out within one or two years. The fundamental way to eliminate war is for soldiers to be unwilling to fight. However, today's people's hearts are no longer like they were immediately after the war. When the war had just ended, everyone was shocked by the great sacrifices of the war and horrified by the pain of the war. Everyone wanted to recuperate in peace. Therefore, an atmosphere of peace was born, and if they were given weapons again and driven to fight, I know they would definitely be unwilling. Today, however, they are oppressed by this economic trend. Not only are the unemployed unable to survive, but even those with small jobs find it difficult to maintain their lives. The hoped-for recuperation has now become a bubble and is unattainable. Therefore, they have to turn their hopes to finding a way to survive in a hopeless situation. Therefore, if they are given weapons again today and driven to fight, it cannot be said that they will be unwilling. In this situation, there is really no way to eliminate war. This is not because people's hearts are warlike or because they want chaos, but because there is an inconceivable misfortune forcing them from behind. Who has the great power to save them? I cannot help but feel deeply moved by the coldness of this Christmas.</p>

It was agreed to discuss it again on the morning of the 27th. Regarding the water line negotiations with the Great Eastern and Great Northern companies, a meeting continued at 3:00 p.m. on the 26th.

Zhang instructed Yu to talk to him in person, but Yu is extremely willing to retire, but in fact, it is not allowed, so he hopes to lead his troops to reclaim wasteland in the Northwest and does not want the people to suffer in the Central Plains again.

<p>Imperial Rescript Personally Bestowed by the Emperor</p>
<p>National Women Demand Suffrage</p>
<p>The Advancement and Retreat of Shidehara Again Becomes a Problem</p>
<p>Civil Administration Party Members in Bright Formal Wear</p>
<p>The Opposition Party Inevitably Appears Inferior</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Japanese United Press): The opening ceremony of the 59th session of the Japanese Parliament was held this morning at 11:00 AM in the House of Peers. The Emperor bestowed the following Rescript: "We hereby hold the opening ceremony of the Imperial Parliament and announce to the members of the House of Peers and the House of Representatives that the friendly relations between the Empire and the contracting nations are becoming increasingly cordial, which We are deeply pleased with. We hereby order the Ministers of State to submit the budget for the 6th year of the Showa era and various ship laws to the Imperial Parliament, hoping that you will embody Our will, deliberate harmoniously, and fulfill your responsibilities in assisting."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Den Tsushin Sha): Fourteen representatives from the Women's Suffrage League, the Women's Suffrage League within the Kyofu-kai, and the Women's Suffrage Acquisition League visited Interior Minister Adachi at his private residence yesterday afternoon, demanding the granting of suffrage, stating that women's civil rights are limited to cities and villages, which is insufficiently thorough, and must be extended to prefectures, and further requesting recognition of suffrage. The Interior Minister replied that he intends to seek expansion and also intends to amend the Public Security Police Law to allow women to join political associations. Subsequently, the representatives requested the Interior Minister to consider the granting of suffrage and departed at 3:00 PM.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Den Tsushin Sha): It is reported that Wakatsuki, Yamamoto, and Konoe separately visited the Prime Minister, partly to inquire about his health and partly to express their opinions on the issue of Shidehara acting as Prime Minister. However, the young members of the party are extremely eager to convey their intentions to the Prime Minister by some means, and the situation has become unstable again. While the party executives are suppressing the radicalism of the young members, they also want the elders to soften the unique advocacy of Shidehara to a considerable extent in order to maintain peace within the party. The party executives will soon request a meeting with the Prime Minister to report the entire situation and gain his understanding.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Den Tsushin Sha): At today's opening ceremony of the Parliament, the members of the Civil Administration Party, due to their control of the government, from the Prime Minister Shidehara to the participating officials, were all dressed in glittering formal wear, strolling slowly in the halls of the Parliament. The opposition party, Seiyukai, except for President Inukai, who wore full ceremonial dress with a sash, sat in the executives' room. As usual, they used their mockery and foul language, showering spittle, while all others wore tailcoats, inevitably appearing inferior and shabby. The proletarian party members, Oyama, Nishio, and Katayama, etc., did not attend the opening ceremony due to lack of tailcoats and remained in the waiting room.</p>

<p>To Erupt in the Near East Within a Few Years</p>
<p>Best Way to Prevent War is for Soldiers Not to Want to Fight</p>
<p>London dispatch: The great historian H.G. Wells recently spoke at the invitation of the British National Disarmament Discussion Society on peace strategies. In his speech, Wells expressed that peace is not easy to achieve, and the next war will likely occur within a few years. After the last World War, people expected a small break of twenty-five years. Wells said that he fears there will not be such a long break. He also said, "(If you look at the current situation between Italy, Germany, and France, you can see that there is a possibility of war breaking out in the Near East within the next few years. Next year or the year after, there may be some unexpected incidents, and all old hatreds will be revived as a result. Once a cannonball is fired, how will we respond? I feel that Britain is completely unprepared. In my opinion, Britain should prepare an obstacle to prevent the Second World War. This is our responsibility, because all European military departments are clear about what to do after the war starts, but all peace organizations have never planned ahead. However, there is a greater problem than this, which is how to fundamentally eliminate war. Can war be completely abolished? I believe it is possible under certain conditions. The concern is that the new economic state and the old nationalistic ideas are incompatible, leading to increased pressure and eruption. Recently, there has been an international competition to collect gold coins, with the financial authorities of country A fighting with the financial authorities of country B. These people are all surrounded by nationalistic ideas. To get to the root of the problem,</p>

<h3 id="e63">London Christmas Season <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Unprecedentedly Desolate Scene</p>
<p>Commercial Depression Has Led to This</p>
<p>London, 25th (Reuters): Newspapers generally say this year's Christmas is extremely desolate, unprecedented in its desolation. The stagnation of commerce, the large number of unemployed, the heavy taxes, and the anxiety about the future have affected the entire country. It is expected that trade this season will be lower than average.</p>
<p>Sydney, 25th (Reuters): Christmas trade in Australia this year is very slow, only half of what it was in 1929. Retail stores all say that buyers mostly want cheap goods, and almost no one asks about expensive ones.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (National News Agency): There was no snow in Berlin on Christmas Eve, and the temperature was only slightly below zero. However, in the mountains and famous resorts for winter recreation, the weather and accumulated snow were very suitable for winter sports. Therefore, those who took advantage of the holiday to leave the capital for mountain trips or to return to their hometowns were numerous, but only half as many as in previous years, as the downturn in the economy has inevitably reduced the number of tourists. Although business in the capital during Christmas was slightly better than expected, it was still far less than in previous years. Although the municipal government and railway company tried their best to save money, they still set up huge Christmas trees in the city's squares and in front of railway stations to decorate the festival and encourage people to be charitable.</p>
<p>the root cause is narrow-mindedness. To fundamentally remedy the situation, education must be improved. At present, as a temporary measure, there should be an organization to prevent the general tendency towards arbitrary war." Wells concluded by saying that the fundamental solution to preventing war is for soldiers not to want to fight and for the general public to refuse to serve as soldiers and refuse to pay war taxes.

<p>The Washington of Latin America</p>
<p>Colombia (South America) dispatch: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, five South American republics, held a centennial commemorative meeting for the death of Simon Bolivar, the liberator of South America, on the 17th of this month in Santa Marta, Colombia. Bolivar was born in Venezuela and had great ambitions. He was angered by Spain's oppression of the South American countries and vowed to liberate them as his mission. He began his revolutionary career at the age of 22 and completed his goal after 19 years of struggle. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia successively broke free from Spain's shackles as a result of the victory. Bolivar was elected as the first president of Colombia, but he resigned due to attacks from the opposition party in January 1830. He died of lung disease in Santa Marta, Colombia, on December 17 of the same year at the age of 47. At this centennial commemoration, Romeo, the chairman of the League of Nations Conference, represented Tittoni and gave a passionate speech praising Bolivar's personality and achievements on behalf of the League of Nations.

<h3 id="e65">European Unemployment Problem <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Has Two Major Root Causes</p>
<p>Decrease in Emigration and Birth Control Movement</p>
<p>Berlin dispatch: According to German statistics expert Hardingeski, the European unemployment problem has two major causes: one is the restriction of emigration, and the other is the decrease in birth rates. Hardingeski said that between 1800 and 1900, the European population increased by approximately 187 million. At the end of the 19th century, the total population of Europe was 406 million. During this century, approximately 60 million people emigrated overseas. At the end of the 19th century, the number of Europeans living outside of Europe reached 200 million. In the second half of this period, approximately 2 million people emigrated from Europe each year, but currently, the number of people emigrating each year does not exceed 500,000, which is one-fourth of the former number. This is the main reason for the influx of unemployed people in European countries. As for the decrease in emigration, it is due to the war and the economic impact after the war, and the gradual development of the colonies no longer relies on European goods and trade, which also increases the number of unemployed people in Europe. Secondly, there is the decline in birth rates. This phenomenon became apparent in the second half of the 19th century. The average birth rate in Northern Europe and Western Europe decreased by one-third compared to the middle of the same period. 40 or 50 years ago, families in Western and Northern Europe typically had four or five children, but now they average only two or three. The sharp decrease in birth rates after the war, if it were not for the progress of hygiene, which increased life expectancy, the phenomenon of births slightly exceeding deaths would not be preserved. With more adults than children, the labor market has been severely pressured. The number of workers in Germany is currently 7 million more than before the war, and the number in Britain is also several million more. The number of potential workers is expected to gradually increase until 1939. (World)</p>
<h3 id="e66">US Bank Discount Rate Reduced <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 24th (National News Agency): The German business community is quite surprised by the U.S. bank interest rate being reduced from 2.5% to 2%, but it is expected that the European market will be immediately affected, especially the British exchange market. However, the German gold market feels slightly beneficial, as the lower interest rate in the United States will prompt its investors to turn their attention to Germany.</p>

<p>Berlin, 24th (National News Agency): Dr. David, an important member of the Social Democratic Party, passed away today at the age of 67. Dr. David had been a member of Parliament since 1903. In 1918, he served as Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, and in February 1919, he served as the first chairman of the Weimar National Assembly. Later, he served as Minister of the Interior several times.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Commander-in-Chief Chiang Departs Hankou for Nanjing <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang arrived in Hankou on the 21st, he has been meeting with various army division, brigade, and regimental commanders for days, appointing a director for bandit suppression and rural pacification in the border areas of Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei, as well as commanders of various sub-districts. He also telegraphed the chairmen of the six provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, etc., to be cautious in selecting county magistrates. With the bandit suppression matters in Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces largely planned, he took the "Yong Sui" warship at twelve noon today (the 25th) to return to Nanjing. The details of the past two days are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inspecting Qian Dajun's Troops: At 9:00 AM yesterday (the 24th), Commander-in-Chief Chiang, accompanied by the chief of staff of the headquarters, He Chengjun, the general commander of the 16th Route Army, Xu Yuanquan, the Wuhan Garrison Commander, Xia Douyin, the commander of the 14th Division, Qian Dajun, and many adjutants and soldiers, crossed the river by special boat to Nanhu, Wuchang, to inspect the 14th Division under Qian Dajun. After the inspection, he summoned all officers and soldiers for a speech, the gist of which can be divided into two points: (1) Officers teaching soldiers should lead by example and possess complete physical and mental strength. Although there is a lack of material resources now, it can be supplemented with spirit. (2) The basic principles of training an army must start with diet, daily life, sweeping, and social etiquette. Officers and soldiers should be like family members, fathers and sons, loving each other and being sincere with each other. Only then can this army be invincible. After the speech, he accompanied He Chengjun, Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Qian Dajun, and others to the Zuoqi to visit the military academy.</p>
<p>Visiting the Wuhan Military Academy: Commander-in-Chief Chiang's party arrived at the Wuhan Military Academy at 10:00 AM. He summoned all the officers and students of the school for a speech, stating briefly that in the current Chinese revolution, the warlords have already been eliminated, but the imperialists have not yet been defeated. Young students are the basic force of the revolution, and their future responsibilities are still significant. The Premier once said, "When will China be considered a successful revolution and the National Revolution come to an end? It is when all unequal treaties are abolished so that China can truly achieve independence and freedom, and the Chinese nation can truly be equal in the international community. Only then can the National Revolution come to an end." This responsibility can only be undertaken by young students. Now, efforts should be made in two areas: First, to restore the academic atmosphere, rectify discipline, and be a complete model of a citizen. Second, to pay attention to educational policies, to be independent, self-governing, self-reliant, and autonomous, to cultivate the noble personality of a soldier. It is hoped that all students will know the responsibility of the revolution, continue the Premier's legacy, learn the Premier's character, learn the Premier's spirit, learn the Premier's thoughts, and learn the Premier's aspirations to complete the great cause of the revolution led by the Premier.</p>
<p>Attending a Banquet at the Provincial Government: The Hubei Provincial Government hosted a banquet for Commander-in-Chief Chiang and Wu Zhihui at the auditorium of the Provincial Government at twelve noon yesterday. In addition to the Chairman of the Provincial Government, He Chengjun, all members of the committee, and important officials of various departments, all members of the provincial party headquarters, and Xu Yuanquan, Xia Douyin, Qian Dajun, Chen Cheng, Yin Zusheng, and others were also present. Chiang arrived at the Provincial Government immediately after his speech at the military academy. Central Committee member Wu Zhihui also rushed there after visiting the Wuhan University Education Department. Chiang gave a speech to all members of the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Headquarters, saying that the Communist Party in Hubei is rampant, and heavy troops have been dispatched to suppress them. There are no major military issues now, but the elimination of the Communist Party and the aftermath problems require the government and the party headquarters to cooperate effectively. The committee members of the party headquarters in various counties and the county magistrates of various counties must be carefully selected. In the future, the activities of the party headquarters in various places must be guided by the committee members themselves to completely eliminate the Communist Party and enable the people to live and work in peace. If there are still disturbances or invasions by the Communist Party within the area seen by the party headquarters, it would be a great disgrace to our party members and the party headquarters. On the government side, the selection of county magistrates must be cautious. They must be experienced, knowledgeable, diligent, honest, and incorruptible to be qualified. Gradually, the household registration should be checked and the Baojia system implemented so that the bandits and communists have no chance of resurgence. It is hoped that the party and government authorities will pay special attention to this.</p>
<p>Announcing the Border Region Commanders: Commander-in-Chief Chiang, considering that this is a period of bandit suppression and to prevent the bandits from fleeing far away, each province cannot forcibly divide its territory. He has appointed Xu Yuanquan as the Director of Bandit Suppression and Rural Pacification in the border areas of Sichuan, Hunan, and Hubei, and Wang Jinyu as the Director of Bandit Suppression and Rural Pacification in the border areas of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, each responsible for their respective areas. He also ordered them to take office immediately and organize the directorate offices. (It is reported that Wang Jinyu took a train south from Zhengzhou on the evening of the 23rd and arrived in Hankou in the early morning of the 25th to ask for instructions from Chiang. It is said that the directorate office for the Sichuan-Hunan-Hubei border will be located in Yichang, and the directorate office for the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border will be located in Pingxiang. Xu and Wang will go to their designated locations after Chiang leaves Hankou to begin organizing.) Subsequently, in order to strive for thoroughness, he divided the Sichuan-Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi border area into eight districts today (the 25th) and appointed commanders for each district. The first district commander is Li Jue, under whom the 19th Division is assigned. The second and third district commander is Wang Jinyu, under whom the 47th and 43rd Divisions are assigned. The fourth district commander is Liu Jianxu, under whom the 15th, 11th, and New 32nd Divisions are assigned. The fifth district commander is Hao Mengling, under whom the 54th Division is assigned. The sixth district commander is Liu Yi, under whom the Independent 14th Brigade is assigned. The seventh district commander is Xiao Zhichu, under whom the 44th Division, New 34th Division, Independent 10th Brigade, New 2nd Brigade, and Garrison Brigade are assigned. The eighth district commander is Xu Yuanquan, under whom the 48th Division and Guo Xun's Brigade, New 3rd Brigade, and Temporary 19th Brigade are assigned. All are required to assemble at the designated locations before January 15th.</p>
<p>Meeting with Military and Political Dignitaries: Wuhan military and political dignitaries, such as He Chengjun, Liu Wendao, Xia Douyin, etc., considering that Chiang and Liu are about to return to Nanjing and there are still many issues to be instructed, went to the headquarters at 10:00 AM on the 25th to pay their respects and have a face-to-face meeting with Chiang for about an hour. Chiang instructed that after he returns to Nanjing, He will still be responsible for the military affairs of bandit suppression in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. The 11th Division Commander Chen Cheng, 9th Division Commander Chiang Dingwen, 14th Division Commander Qian Dajun, 9th Army Commander Wang Jinyu, 44th Division Commander Xiao Zhichu, and 43rd Division Commander Guo Huazong also came one after another to ask Chiang for instructions. However, the 7th Route Army Commander Liu Xiang originally planned to come to Hankou to pay his respects to Chiang, personally report on the military and political situation in Sichuan, and ask for instructions on the aftermath policy. Chiang had dispatched a plane to Yichang to bring him. However, due to Liu's illness, he could not fly, so it was cancelled. The "Yongke" plane sent to pick him up has returned to Hankou from Yichang. Therefore, Chiang did not wait and decided to return to Nanjing on the 25th.</p>
<p>Changing to a Train and Ship to Go East: Commander-in-Chief Chiang, considering that the affairs in Hankou are over, instructed the "Yong Sui" warship to raise steam on the evening of the 24th. At the same time, he sent an adjutant to purchase a ticket for a China Aviation Company plane, scheduled to depart from Hankou at 9:30 AM on the 25th. However, the company stated that they had not received formal notification, and the "Wuchang" plane still flew away on schedule at 8:00 AM. When Chiang arrived at the airport, the plane had already departed, so he returned to the headquarters and changed to the "Yong Sui" warship at twelve noon to go east. He also ordered Wuhan Garrison Commander Xia Douyin not to be on alert, only the chief of the police tenth district, Wang Shoushan, temporarily brought many policemen to be on inconspicuous guard at the Sanbei Wharf, so very few outsiders knew. Chiang then boarded the "Yong Sui" warship directly with Central Committee members Wu Zhihui and Shao Lizi. Military and political dignitaries such as He Chengjun, Wu Xingya, Liu Wendao, Xia Douyin, Xu Yuanquan, Xiao Zhichu, Wang Jinyu, Guo Huazhong, Fan Shisheng, Guo Rulian, Chen Cheng, Qian Dajun, Yin Zusheng, etc., boarded the "Yong Sui" warship to see him off. At twelve thirty, the anchor was raised and the ship sailed. It is said that it will not be delayed along the way and will return directly to the capital. The "Minquan" and "Chuyou" ships anchored in the Han River also followed the "Yong Sui" warship east to escort it, commanded by Navy Torpedo Commander Zeng Yiding, stationed on the "Minquan" ship. But it is heard that they will escort it to Jiujiang or Huangzhou and then return to Hankou. The Director of the General Political Training Department, Zhou Fo Hai, and staff members of various departments of the headquarters took other merchant ships such as the "Ningshao" and "Jiangtian" and sailed late at night, deciding to disembark at Anqing.</p>
<p>Sending a Telegram to Six Provinces Before Departure: Before leaving, Commander-in-Chief Chiang personally drafted a hand-written order on the evening of the 24th, sending it to the chairmen of the six provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Fujian, Anhui, and Henan, urging them to be cautious in selecting county magistrates, raising their status, and guaranteeing their employment. It was sent out by urgent telegram that night. The original telegram is as follows: (Urgent, to Chairman He of the Hunan Provincial Government, Chairman Liu of the Henan Provincial Government, Chairman He of the Hubei Provincial Government, Chairman Lu of the Jiangxi Provincial Government, Chairman Chen of the Anhui Provincial Government, Chairman Yang of the Fujian Provincial Government, and forwarded to all county magistrates: Recently, it has been found that many county magistrates in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Henan, Fujian, and Anhui are complacent and neglect their duties. They have no precautions in peacetime and do not pay attention to visits and investigations. They do not check household registration, implement the Baojia system, supervise the training of local militias, or carry out important local autonomy policies. Therefore, upon hearing of small bandits, they report bandit alerts. If bandits are far away, they do not investigate their whereabouts, and they flee upon hearing the news. The reason why the bandits and communists in various provinces are so rampant today is largely due to the county magistrates not fulfilling their responsibilities and not being the right people. Therefore, to clear the bandits and communists, it is necessary to strictly select county magistrates and severely punish county magistrates who are negligent. However, the county is a unit of autonomy and is the foundation of internal affairs. Therefore, the importance of the county magistrate's position is self-evident, and its status should be actively raised. Therefore, I clearly inform the party, government, and military personnel of all provinces that in the future, when troops arrive in the county, regardless of officers or soldiers, they should respect the county magistrate and not treat them as military service, let alone insult the county magistrate. Otherwise, the responsible officer will be questioned, and the crime will be punished in the same way as insulting a direct superior. Moreover, our party members should respect the county magistrate's position even more, so that their credibility with the people will increase, and their governance will be easier. Investigating household registration and organizing the Baojia system are the sole responsibilities of local party members. Therefore, in addition to helping the county magistrate investigate and organize, they must also personally take action and serve as members of the Bao Wei Tuan (self-defense corps), etc., working conscientiously. They must not compete for the title of Jia Zhang (Bao leader) or Tuan Zhang (corps leader), lest people see our party members as those who seek power and profit. As for the county magistrate, they should be self-reliant and self-respecting. Whether it is to party members or soldiers, they should cooperate effectively and stand in a leading position. They should lead by example in everything, be loyal to their duties, and strive to protect the people. In this time of chaos, it must be understood that only by clarifying household registration, organizing the Baojia system, and strictly implementing the autonomy regulations promulgated by the provincial government can bandits be cleared and governance be spoken of. Not only must it be implemented conscientiously, but it must also be visited and urged morning and night, striving to ensure it is done. Then the people will all be governed, and the bandits will all be cleared. Do not abandon your duties or flee upon hearing the news. If a large number of bandits come to surround the city, then strengthen the walls and clear the fields, close the city and defend it firmly. You must have the determination to survive with the city or perish with the city to be called a virtuous official and to be called diligent in your duty. In the future, if there are county magistrates who abandon the county seat, regardless of the circumstances, they will be dealt with according to military law. If there are no crimes of misconduct or loss of land, the provincial governments should firmly guarantee that their three-year term is completed and recommend them for promotion. Peng Xueyou, the former county magistrate of Ji'an, abandoned the city and lost the land, and usually feared bandits like tigers, even colluding with them for self-preservation. Why wait to punish him? Therefore, he was specially arrested for strict interrogation and punished according to military law. I hope all county magistrates will be wary and not neglect this. This order is issued by Chiang Kai-shek, December 24th, at the Hankou Headquarters.) (December 25th)</p>

We are telegramming you again, requesting that you order the armies to return all detained vehicles to the various lines to uphold the decrees and maintain transportation. This is a public matter. Respectfully submitted by Sun Ke, Minister of Railways.)</p>
<h3 id="e70">Post-Abolition of Likin Revenue in Hunan Province <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Consumption Tax Temporarily Managed by the Province</p>
<p>New Tax Bureau Directors Announced</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province, in accordance with the central government's clear order to abolish Likin, has decided to abolish all Likin bureaus in the province from New Year's Day next year and replace them with business tax and special consumption tax to compensate for the loss. However, it is urgently necessary to resolve whether the special consumption tax should be managed by the local government or by the central government. This is because, according to the central government's regulations, after the abolition of Likin, business tax belongs to the province, and special consumption tax belongs to the central government. If the provincial treasury's business tax revenue is insufficient to compensate for the loss due to the abolition of Likin, the central government will allocate funds to compensate. The local government expenses of Hunan Province amount to about 1.5 million yuan per month, relying on Likin revenue as the largest source, averaging 500,000 to 600,000 yuan per month. After the abolition of Likin, business tax and consumption tax will be levied. It is estimated that business tax will yield more than 100,000 yuan per month, and special consumption tax will yield more than 200,000 yuan per month. The two items combined amount to only more than 300,000 yuan per month, which is 200,000 to 300,000 yuan less than the original Likin revenue. If the special consumption tax is allocated to the central government, the provincial treasury will feel even more difficult, and all government affairs will be in danger of stagnation. He Jian met with Chairman Chiang and Minister Song in Lushan a few days ago and personally requested that the special consumption tax be temporarily assigned to the local government of Hunan Province until the central government's compensation for Hunan Province is determined. Minister Song did not allow it at the time. After He Jian returned to the province on the 22nd, he convened a meeting of all members of the provincial government at 2:00 PM on the 23rd to discuss in detail. Since the budget for the 19th year would allocate the consumption tax to the local government, and the difference between income and expenditure was still a huge 7 million yuan, and once the compensation from the central government was determined, it would still be handed over to the central government, which would not hinder the unified national fiscal plan. Therefore, it was decided that, on the one hand, to respect the central government's order, and on the other hand, to maintain the local government expenses of Hunan Province, the business tax and consumption tax would be levied by Hunan Province simultaneously from New Year's Day. Before the central government's compensation is determined, the consumption tax will not be transferred to the central government. On the one hand, the Director of the Department of Finance, Zhang Kailian, will be sent to Beijing at the end of the year to present to the Ministry of Finance the financial difficulties of Hunan Province and the necessity of temporarily assigning the consumption tax to Hunan Province, requesting understanding. On the one hand, He Jian will send a telegram to Minister Song to present everything, saying, (I received your instructions in Guling. I have personally reported the exhaustion of financial resources in Hunan Province and the situation of no funds after the abolition of Likin. I returned to Hunan from Han on a day of rest, just a few days before the scheduled abolition of Likin. Merchants are hesitant, and tax revenue is sharply reduced. However, the provincial expenses, party and government expenses, still rely entirely on the distribution of Likin revenue. Each week, only 2% of the due notice can be distributed, and the accumulation of arrears is increasing. Moreover, the end of the year is approaching, and the facts are obvious and cannot be concealed. The central government has abolished Likin and issued a clear order that we dare not exceed. However, considering the provincial governance, it is difficult to do without resources. The business tax allocated to the local government according to the original plan is not only not sufficient, but it is estimated that the revenue is not enough to compensate for Likin by 1/10,000. I have previously requested in a telegram to temporarily assign the consumption tax to the Hunan Provincial Finance Department for collection, waiting for the central government's compensation to be determined, and then return it to the central government. This is to rescue the interruption of provincial funds, maintain autonomy, and not be contrary to the central government's unified national tax system. Now that the tax law is being reformed, the central government and the local government must support each other, and the provincial governance can be developed from stability. The financial resources of Hunan Province have long been exhausted, and the government expenses have been reduced repeatedly. There is no magic to turn things into gold, and all resources have been exhausted. Now, due to the urgency of the situation, we have followed your request to send personnel to start levying consumption tax, and ordered all Likin bureaus to be abolished on schedule. Business tax is also levied simultaneously. I am sending this telegram to file it, and I hope to receive your reply. Your respectful younger brother, He Jian, respectfully submits.) As for the establishment locations of the two tax bureaus, the selection of bureau directors, and the implementation methods, they have also been decided as follows: (A) Business Tax. The tax rate is divided into three items: (1) Luxury businesses and other businesses that should be banned or that hinder the development of domestic goods, 3/1000. (2) Businesses taxed according to capital, 1.5/1000. (3) All other businesses, 2/1000. All agencies collecting business tax, except for the ten important and prosperous counties, where a collection bureau is established in each county, are handled by the finance bureau in the remaining counties, and by the county government in counties where there is no finance bureau. It is uniformly scheduled to start on New Year's Day in the 20th year. The establishment locations and directors were also announced yesterday. The Director of the Changsha Business Tax Collection Bureau is Gan Rong, the Director of the Xiangtan Bureau is Xie Yiru, the Director of the Changde Bureau is Li Xiangjun, the Director of the Yiyang Bureau is Zhang Shucheng, the Director of the Hengyang Bureau is Li Tun, the Director of the Lixian Bureau is Ouyang, the Director of the Huitong Bureau is Yang Xuran, the Director of the Nanxian Bureau is Luo Yousong, and the Director of the Baoqing Bureau is Peng Zhize. (B) Special Consumption Tax. Hunan Province will temporarily levy on sixteen categories, namely, oil, tea, paper, tin foil, seafood, wood, porcelain, raw bamboo, medicinal materials, lacquer, fur, large-scale mineral sand, salt, silk, soybeans, and cotton. The tax rate follows the central government's regulations. There are a total of ten bureaus in the province. The establishment locations and bureau directors are: Director of the Provincial Special Consumption Collection Bureau Zhou Jiezhi, Director of the Yueyang Bureau Zeng Xian, Director of the Yiyang Bureau Chen Junnan, Director of the Changde Bureau Chen Libin, Director of the Jinshi Bureau Shi Yongnian, Director of the Xiangtan Bureau Lin Yongyan, Director of the Hengyang Bureau Tian Ling, Director of the Yuanling Bureau Dai Qingmen, Director of the Nanhua An Bureau He Yindong, and Director of the Shatou Timber Tax Inspection Bureau Lv Qipeng.

<p>Jiang Pingfan and Lin Enpu Collude in Corruption</p>
<p>District Prosecutors Seize More Than One Hundred Pieces of Evidence</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Merchants and residents are actively opposing the reconstruction of the Wanshou and Jiangnan bridges in Fujian. On the 20th of this month, the Minhou District Prosecutor's Office, in order to investigate the truth of this case, specially dispatched Prosecutor Yang Chongshi to lead bailiffs and police officers from the Fifth Precinct to search the residence of Chen Yanming (also known as Chen Shiquan, also known as Hai Guan Jiu Zhai) in Tating, Nantai. More than one hundred pieces of evidence suspected of collusion in corruption by Jiang Pingfan, Director of the Construction Department, and Lin Enpu, Director of the Public Works Bureau, were seized. Thirty-nine of them are important. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Jiang Pingfan, Provincial Government Committee Member and Director of the Construction Department, suddenly signed a contract with the Japanese to build the two bridges without first reporting to the provincial government for the record before Xu Xianshi resumed his position. Although the provincial government added amendments to the articles that would harm national sovereignty, the points regarding the loss of money and the disadvantages to merchants and residents have not yet been assessed. However, the project started on the 15th. Merchants and residents have repeatedly requested a postponement of the bridge filling, but it has been ineffective. The District Prosecutor's Office received repeated reports and learned that Jiang and Lin had close contact with Chen Yanming and there were major suspicions. Therefore, on the 17th, it was approved by the court. On the 20th, Prosecutor Yang led clerks Feng Jiasheng, Chen Binyao, Zhang Yuanzhen, and bailiffs and patrol officers in three cars to the Fifth Police Precinct, where they met with patrol officers, patrol leaders, and many police officers. They went to Chen's residence, saying they wanted to see Chen Yanming. Chen's family replied that he was out. His wife, a certain Ms. So-and-so, upon being warned by the bailiff, returned to the room. At the same time, the sound of unlocking the door was heard from the room. The bailiffs, Chen's nephew Yousheng, and his relatives entered the bedroom to search. At first, nothing was found. Finally, a large package of documents was found near where the bedpan was placed. Among them were thirty-nine secret letters regarding the Anping Real Estate Company and consultations with various parties on building the bridge, all numbered. Chen's wife turned pale and wept on the iron bed. Subsequently, seventy or eighty letters related to the case were found in the living room. From 11:00 AM to 6:00 PM, Prosecutor Yang hired a boat back to the office, where he consulted with Chief Prosecutor Chen Shirong. That night, he issued a warrant for Chen Yanming's arrest, but he was not found. Therefore, he sent a letter to the military and police agencies to assist in the arrest. He also subpoenaed Jiang Pingfan and Lin Enpu to appear in court this Thursday for investigation. The Institute of Commercial Affairs and various chambers of commerce held meetings and sent telegrams to Yang Shuzhuang in Shanghai and the fellow villagers' associations in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as to Lin Sen, Chen Shaokuan, Ding Yuewu, Chen Jiliang, and Xu Xianshi in Zhangzhou, reporting the facts of Jiang, Lin, and Chen's corruption. The provincial party headquarters also stated that if the evidence is conclusive, it would be a disgrace to official conduct. In addition to sending Gan and Kang Shaozhou to inquire with Prosecutor Yang about the situation, they also convened an emergency meeting this morning (the 23rd). According to inside information, (A) The dyke construction project is undertaken by Anping Company. The required project cost is about 197,000 yuan, which is also advanced by the company. After the dyke is completed in the future, the proceeds from the sale of land will be given back to the company first. If there is a surplus, 70% goes to the public and 30% is a reward. This dyke can be built and sold at the same time, and the land price will be given back to the company to advance the funds. Therefore, the company does not actually have to advance 190,000 yuan. After the company recovers the full amount of the advance funds, if there is still unsold land on the dyke, the Construction Department should reduce the original reserve price by 20% before voting again. If no one still buys it, the company will accept it at the reduced reserve price, but the reward fee will still be paid. In this contract, Anping Company only advances part of the project cost and receives the entire reward, and can manipulate the dyke real estate at any time. The public suffers a great loss, and the major shareholders of Anping Company are Jiang, Lin, and Chen, but they use the name of Ye Guoqi to sign the contract with Jiang. (B) The bridge construction project is contracted by the Japanese Daiwa Industrial Joint-Stock Company, which is said to have been introduced by Lin Enpu and Chen Yanming. In fact, only Daiwa's technicians are hired as guides. All projects are contracted by Lin and Chen themselves. The project costs are inevitably inflated. Otherwise, according to the public construction project regulations, drawings are made, materials are listed, a reserve price is set, and domestic and foreign engineering groups are openly invited to bid and lead the project. This time, the contract was recommended by the Japan Taiwan Civil Engineering and Construction Association for Daiwa Industrial Company to undertake. This has raised questions. Yesterday, High Prosecutor Ke Linghan and Chief Prosecutor Chen Shirong went to the provincial government to meet with Chen Peikun, reporting the reasons for summoning Jiang, Lin, etc., for investigation. It is also heard that he has telegraphed the central government, requesting that Jiang and Lin be suspended from their positions and brought to justice for investigation and prosecution. However, it is heard that Jiang and Lin also telegraphed Yang Shu and Jiang for assistance and hired many lawyers for defense. The bridge construction project has been suspended as a result.

<h3 id="e82">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Thorough Abolition of Likin <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Prohibiting Provinces and Regions from Delaying Under Various Pretexts</p>
<p>Strictly Forbidding the Establishment of Various Items Under Likin</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating, "We have received Your Ministry's general telegram that all likin and similar transit taxes should be permanently abolished by December 31st of this year. Decades of sick merchants and corrupt policies have been removed in one day. The chronic disease has recovered, and there is hope. It fully demonstrates the government's adherence to the legacy of the late Premier, which is clear and decisive. We are deeply impressed. We are concerned that provinces may use the excuse of financial difficulties to delay the matter or create various items to continue their demands. This would undermine the success of the project. We have read the general telegram, which also earnestly warns us about this. The association believes that likin has long been included in national taxes, and land taxes are entirely local. Therefore, this abolition of likin, even if there is a loss, falls within the scope of national taxes. Provinces and regions must not use the excuse of no compensation. Moreover, there is a business tax that can be used to supplement it. They must not be allowed to undermine the overall plan and burden the government's new policy. We should resolutely uphold: (1) Do not allow provinces and regions to delay under various pretexts. (2) Strictly prohibit the establishment of various items other than likin. The two items of special consumption tax and business tax that are currently under discussion have outlines for tax items and tax rates that were formulated during the likin abolition meeting. They must be strictly implemented to avoid abuses. Recently, the proposed tax rate for the business tax in Jiangsu Province has been increased tenfold compared to the original outline. The unified tax on yarn factories has been increased to two or four or five times the current rate. This means that one abuse has not been removed, and another abuse has arisen. Merchants who are eagerly awaiting governance will be disappointed. We hope that you will pay close attention to this matter. The third item of the general outline of special consumption tax, which states that the authorities must consult the opinions of commercial organizations, and the fifth item of the business tax outline, which states that a business tax review committee should be jointly established by officials and merchants, must be implemented one by one to ensure that merchants have the opportunity to express their opinions and avoid major mistakes. Even if there are no means of remedy after exhausting appeals, we offer our humble opinions and hope that you will consider them. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

Therefore, the shortage is very small.</p>
<p>Screening Films - The preparatory committee's entertainment department initially proposed to issue half-price tickets to various circles.

<h3 id="e85">Prosperous Yangtze River Shipping of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>It Has Leapt to the Top of the Six Companies</p>
<p>After the military Yangtze River ships were returned, Li Zhonggong, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, discussed with Shen Zhongyi, head of the business department, and others, and first actively reorganized the Yangtze River route. They dispatched regular ships, added tugs and barges, opened new lines, and handled joint transportation. They also took over the Wuxue lighter and recovered the lost shipping rights. In the past two months, they have been vigorously advancing separately, and the Yangtze River route has achieved results. The Jianglun business of the company, which used to be below Taigu, Yihuo, and Riqing, has now suddenly leapt to the first place among the six companies. The general information heard is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Pinghan Joint Transportation - Pinghan Road freight transportation has been suspended for more than three years. It was not until November that the entire line was opened due to the end of the military affairs. The goods transported from the Pinghan line to Hankou and then transferred to Shanghai and other places are 1,500 to 2,000 tons per day. Among them, those transported to Shanghai, except for those going to the East Yang transported by Riqing, and those loaded to Shanghai's local street, have been agreed upon by Li Yunliang, Director of the Han Branch of the company, and the Pinghan Railway Bureau. The contract for the joint transportation of vehicles has been signed. All goods transferred from Pinghan Road to Shanghai will be given priority transportation rights by China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. It has already been implemented. Therefore, the company's downstream cargo has greatly increased compared to before.</p>
<p>Adding Ships to Changsha - The Hunan route has been expanded to six times a month since China Merchants Steam Navigation Company resumed operations this year. Recently, due to the export of Xiang rice, it has been agreed that the Xiang province will reduce the export rice donation by 1.5 yuan, and the Wuhan transit fee of 1 yuan will also be exempted. As a result, Hunan rice has begun to be loaded for export. The company has contacted Xiang rice merchants to carry the goods. In order to make up for the insufficient two shipments, it was decided to add another ship. Li Yunliang came to Shanghai this time to discuss the addition of ships and expansion matters with General Manager Li, which has been approved and will be implemented next month.</p>
<p>Prosperous Business - According to the company's survey, there are more than 500,000 tons of miscellaneous grains, cotton, and tobacco stored in Zhengzhou and Xinyang, and most of them need to be transferred to Shanghai for export to various ports. In these two months, the Jianglun business of the company has greatly improved both upstream and downstream. On average, each ship carries about 8,000 pieces of upstream cargo and about 6,000 pieces of downstream cargo. Riqing averages about 6,000 pieces upstream and downstream, Yihuo about 5,000, and Taigu the least, only about 4,000 pieces. Among the six companies, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has leapt to the first place. Riqing transports slightly more yarn and cloth upstream, and miscellaneous grains are transported downstream to the East Ocean. It occupies the second place.</p>
<p>Navigation Interrupted in Western Hunan - Hunan is an important port for Jianglun business. Although ships can travel on various roads in central Hunan, western Hunan has not been able to open to navigation due to the unrest of the bandits. Tung oil, which is a major item among the downstream goods, is sold especially to the United States. The situation this year is very different. The waterway is blocked, and the United States is already planting tung trees. Therefore, the transportation of Hunan tung oil to the United States has plummeted.</p>
<p>Request to Reduce Water Fees - After the six companies in this port increased the Yangtze River shallow water fee, the Nanzun Railway Transportation Office sent a telegram to the Chinese shipping companies in this port, requesting that the increased water fees of 10% to 50% for upstream and downstream cargo be canceled immediately and the original price be restored. It generally said that the Nanzun transportation has just opened, and there are many goods waiting to be loaded. Foreign shipping companies are increasing the water fees by high-pressure means, and our Chinese shipping companies should not also follow suit and increase the fees to benefit commercial transportation. Sanbei China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, etc., believe that this matter concerns the unified management of the six companies and cannot be uniquely different. Therefore, they did not agree to stop the increase and replied to the Nanzun Railway Transportation Office.</p>
<h3 id="e86">New Locomotives for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Inviting the Press for a Test Ride</p>
<p>Departed Suzhou at 5:25 AM Yesterday</p>
<p>Journey Time: 2 Hours and 3 Minutes</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau recently ordered eight Pacific-type locomotives from the British North British Locomotive Company. Upon arrival in Shanghai, the Wusong Machine Factory expedited their assembly. Four locomotives, numbered C53, 54, 55, and 56, have been completed, with the remaining four still being assembled. Yesterday morning at 5:25 AM, the Bureau specifically conducted a test run of the new locomotive (53) between Shanghai and Suzhou, inviting members of the press to ride along. The scheduled arrival time in Suzhou was one hour and fifteen minutes. However, due to the cautious operation of the new locomotive, the journey ultimately took two hours and three minutes. Although there was a sixteen-minute stopover en route, the actual speed only exceeded the express train speed by about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Besides eighteen reporters from various newspapers, the passengers included Mr. White from the Sino-British Company, Chief Engineer Dasifu, Deputy Director Zheng Baozhao of the Traffic Department, Director Fen Ci of the Locomotive Department, Deputy Director Wang Chengzhu, Chief Section Leader Chen Xinghan of the two-route station, Chief Section Leader Fang Bolin of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, Electrical Inspector Ma Zhishan, and Clerk Lu Dingbei. The test train consisted of one fourth-class carriage, two third-class carriages, one baggage car, and two parlor cars, PC No. 13 and No. 14. The press corps rode in parlor car No. 13, with Deputy Director Zheng Baozhao and Mr. Ma Zhishan accompanying them, providing meticulous reports on everything.</p>
<p>The train departed from the North Station at 5:25 AM yesterday. The sky was still dark. At 5:55 AM, it arrived at Nanxiang Station and departed again at 6:00 AM. The sky gradually brightened, and the speed increased. The Railway Bureau specially prepared breakfast for the guests. At 6:13 AM, the train passed Anting Station. At 6:30 AM, it passed Lujiabang Station. At 6:40 AM, it passed Kunshan Station. At 7:05 AM, it passed Yiting Station. At 7:20 AM, it passed Waikuatang Station. At 7:28 AM, it arrived at Suzhou Main Station. After the passengers disembarked, Mr. Lu Dingbei took a group photo of everyone in front of the new locomotive to commemorate the occasion. The original train remained in Suzhou for several hours, finally departing for Shanghai at 11:10 AM.</p>
<p>Vice-Director of Transportation Zheng Baozhao and Newspaper Reporters take a photo next to the new locomotive when it arrived at Suzhou station (Photographed by Ye Changlie)</p>
<p>According to Deputy Director Zheng Baozhao, the departure time was 5:25 AM, and the arrival time at Suzhou Station was 7:28 AM. Since it was a test run, the train had to be inspected at each station, and oil was added to prevent overheating. The total stopover time at various stations was sixteen minutes, so the actual speed was one hour and forty-seven minutes. The usual speed of the express train is two hours and ten minutes, while that of the slow regional train is two hours and thirty minutes. If the train runs for a slightly longer period of time, the components will become smoother, and the time spent adding oil will be reduced, resulting in a significant increase in speed.</p>
<p>According to Deputy Director Wang Chengzhu of the Locomotive Department, the new locomotive generates steam easily and has a strong pulling force. While the old locomotive could only pull a load of 17,000 pounds, the new one can pull 28,000 pounds. It is equipped with a device that adds water to the hot steam, eliminating the need to directly add cold water to the boiler. It can also use the exhaust steam from the chimney to boil water, which is then fed into the steam boiler, further saving coal. It is said that the railways in Korea and South Manchuria are also using this Pacific-type locomotive. The entire new locomotive is one-third longer than the old locomotive, and the boiler and steam shaft are larger than those of the old locomotive, while the driving wheels are slightly smaller. The locomotive, including the coal car and water car, weighs a total of 156 tons, and it can pull 28,000 pounds. It is worth 8,400 gold pounds, and with the addition of shipping costs and tariffs, it costs a total of 9,000 pounds, which is approximately 200,000 Chinese dollars.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau has scheduled the official inauguration ceremony for the new locomotive to be held on the 30th of this month. The train will depart from Shanghai North Station at 10:30 AM on that day, heading directly to Kunshan. At that time, representatives from various agencies and organizations will be invited to ride along. Free test ride tickets will be distributed to various sectors today and tomorrow.</p>

<p>More Than 200 People Attended</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, the representative to the Centennial Independence Exposition in Belgium, returned to China on the 13th of this month. Fellow townsmen from Huzhou initiated a meeting to welcome him. Shao Ruxin, Dong Tianya, and others actively prepared in advance. Yesterday afternoon, a public banquet was held at the Atlantic Restaurant. More than 200 people attended, including representatives from various banquet delegations, committee members from the Collection of Goods Committee, representatives from various organizations, fellow townsmen from Huzhou such as Wang Yiting, Ling Mingzhi, and Shao Ruxin, as well as guests. Ye Gengsheng, Chen Gonglu, and others were invited. At 6:00 PM, the welcome meeting was opened with a bell.</p>
<p>Liu Daofang served as master of ceremonies and publicly elected Shao Ruxin, Chen Yiyuan, and Lin Jun as members of the presidium. After the formal salutations, all the guests first expressed their welcome with applause. Then, Representative Chu was invited to report on his experiences in Belgium. His original speech was quite lengthy. He briefly stated that he was fortunate not to have failed in his mission at the exposition and that he could find comfort in that. He also hoped that China's agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors would work harder to improve in the future, and that the government should pay attention to international trade, establish ocean-going shipping companies, international exchange banks, and pay attention to the promotion of goods. Then, Presidium member Lin Jun gave a welcome speech. After that, Shao Ruxin, director of the preparatory office, reported on the preparatory work for the welcome meeting, saying that the welcome to Mr. Chu was not based on private feelings among fellow townsmen, but rather on welcoming Mr. Chu's spirit of enthusiasm, industriousness, and thrift in industry and commerce. Next, Lin Kanghou and Wang Xiaolai, members of the Collection of Goods Committee, as well as Ye Liang, the representative of the National Martial Arts Hall, and guests gave speeches one after another. Then, a dinner was held, and the Divine and Strange Eight Immortals Troupe voluntarily participated in performing plays. The meeting ended at 10:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Compensation Funds for the New Da Ming Incident Are Postponed <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Ambassador Replied with the Reasons</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of compensation for the bereaved families of passengers who died in the New Da Ming ship sinking, which was caused by the Japanese ship Atsuta Maru, the Social Affairs Bureau, in conjunction with the Shipping Association, the Seamen's Industrial Union, and the Datong Company, negotiated with the Japanese side. The Japanese trading company Sato &amp; Co. initially only agreed to pay 25,000 yen in compensation. The Social Affairs Bureau and other organizations signed a settlement agreement with the trading company regarding the compensation.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese side has delayed the payment for more than two years, and it has not yet been paid. The families of the victims in Shanghai have spent a considerable amount on waiting for the compensation and on food and lodging expenses. Recently, with the arrival of winter, their living conditions have become even more difficult. They have repeatedly requested the Social Affairs Bureau, the Shipping Association, and other agencies to negotiate for the early receipt of the funds to maintain their livelihoods. Last month, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again urged the Japanese Legation in China to expedite the payment. Yesterday, a reply was finally received from the Japanese Legation, stating that the compensation could not be paid immediately and would still have to be delayed. The original letter is as follows: "Regarding the collision between the ship No. 2 Atsuta Maru, owned by Japanese trading company Sato &amp; Co., and the ship New Da Ming, owned by your country's Datong Shipping Company, your Ministry's letter of November 4 stated that Sato &amp; Co. had admitted to paying 25,000 yen to the crew and passengers who died in the New Da Ming incident, but the funds had not yet been paid. Please urge the Japanese Consul in Shanghai to order the trading company to pay the funds immediately. This has been forwarded to the Consul General, who has been instructed to take measures to expedite the payment. The settlement agreement regarding this case, which was signed between your country's Datong Shipping Company and Sato &amp; Co., was mediated by the Japanese Consul General to ensure its fulfillment. Furthermore, Sato &amp; Co. is also sincerely raising funds. However, due to the impact of unfavorable market conditions, it has been unable to raise sufficient funds as scheduled. Therefore, the fulfillment of the agreement has been inevitably delayed. Please understand the above-mentioned circumstances and convey them to the Shanghai Municipal Government. The Municipal Government has already notified the Shipping Association and the Seamen's Union to convey the information to the families of the victims."</p>
<h3 id="e94">Letter from the Taxpayers' Association to the Municipal Council <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Serious Kidnapping Cases Occur Frequently</p>
<p>Loss of Confidence in Guaranteeing Security</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association sent a letter to the Municipal Council, stating: "Since serious kidnapping cases have been occurring frequently in recent years, this Association believes that it is necessary to suppress them vigorously. We have repeatedly written to your Council urging strict prevention and also submitted six suggestions for preventing kidnapping in our letter of June 9 this year. Your Council only sent a letter inviting us to recommend representatives to discuss the matter. This has been delayed until now, with no results. Although your Council's letter No. 42689 of October 29 last year indicated methods for preventing bandits, it seems that your Council is not paying attention to suppression work. Speaking of actively proceeding, in reality, there is no credibility. In the past week, there have been as many as four kidnapping cases reported in the newspapers alone, and it is difficult to say that there are none that have not been discovered. There have even been many deaths and injuries. With a huge defense expenditure of more than 4.7 million, the result is like this, which proves that the Municipal Council's ability to maintain security has a significant question and the safety of taxpayers' lives and property has been lost. It is a fact that cannot be concealed. We do not know whether your Council has the ability to maintain security. Taxpayers will never want millions of residents' taxes to be used in places that cannot guarantee safety. We hope you will investigate and reply to this letter."</p>
<h3 id="e95">Executive Yuan Order on Compliance with Trade Regulations <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Trade Regulations Set by All Trades in the City</p>
<p>Must Be Submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for Review</p>
<p>Regarding the case where various trades requested the Social Affairs Bureau to require all trades not affiliated with associations to comply with trade regulations, the Bureau repeatedly submitted a request to the Municipal Government, which was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan for approval. Director Pan also raised the issue at the National Industrial and Commercial Conference. It was resolved that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce should adopt and implement the measure. It was previously reported that the Municipal Government has received Executive Yuan Order No. 4476, and this case has been reported back to the Ministry. According to the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, (1) the industry regulations drafted by various trades must be submitted to the local administrative authorities in charge of industry and commerce for approval and record-keeping; (2) once approved and recorded, they will be regarded as the same regulations and must be jointly observed. Anyone who violates them, whether a member or not, may be reported to the authorities for investigation; (3) when industry regulations encounter practical difficulties, the authorities may add or delete them. These three measures, based on the principle of the minority obeying the majority and reviewed by the authorities to prevent abuses, seem feasible. However, since there are no legal provisions requiring mandatory compliance, to ensure that they are universally implemented, the trade regulations set by the trades must be impartial and seek to be permissible by law. The authorities' review standards should be based on whether or not they harm the livelihood of society and the people. If there are situations such as raising prices, restricting production, arbitrarily setting penalties, or involving labor issues, these must be strictly reviewed.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Furthermore, if penalties are set, each case must still be submitted for review and decision, and they must not be implemented without authorization, so as to take into account both legal regulations and commercial realities. After reviewing the Ministry's review points, it seems feasible to take into account both commercial realities and legal regulations. It is hereby ordered that the Municipal Government immediately comply with and implement the measures. The Social Affairs Bureau, after receiving the official document, immediately ordered the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to inform the various trade associations and to quickly submit all trade regulations, whether or not they have been submitted to the authorities for record-keeping, to the Bureau for review.</p>
<h3 id="e96">All Employees of Wine Shops Resumed Work Yesterday <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Losses of Shop Owners Have Been Appropriately Compensated</p>
<p>Compensation for Union Losses Still Under Negotiation</p>
<p>The strike by wine shop employees in this city, which lasted for nine days, ended yesterday with all employees returning to work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The union held a standing committee meeting yesterday to discuss the settlement. Chairman Hu Guzhen presided over the meeting. The results of the discussion are as follows: (1) How to handle the union's losses? It was decided to request the industry association again. (2) Since the strike conditions have been resolved, all shops should be notified to resume work immediately and comply with all trade regulations. The decision was passed. (3) This strike was a joint effort of the executive committee. Now that it has been resolved, a meeting of the executive committee should be convened to conclude the strike. The decision was made that it would be determined after the industry association accepted the union's losses. Emergency Notice: The union issued an emergency notice yesterday, stating that the strike was to protect the negotiations with capital and to fight externally. Now, the Second District Affairs Bureau has ordered compliance. The losses of all shops during the strike have also been compensated. A meeting was held the day before yesterday afternoon, and everyone unanimously agreed that they were satisfied and would resume work the next day. This strike has been a victory for the labor side. Therefore, after resuming work, it is necessary to comply with trade regulations and not cause trouble for no reason. One must abide by one's responsibilities to avoid causing disputes again. This notice is issued in an emergency.</p>

(3) Discussed the case of industries that must join the association and associations that must join the Chamber of Commerce. It was decided to send letters to various industry associations to encourage industries to join the association. (4) Discussed the case of the Community Celebration New Year Preparatory Committee requesting payment of expenses. It was decided to pay 200 yuan. (5) Discussed the case of the National Federation of Commerce requesting a temporary suspension of the establishment of seven rural branch offices. It was decided that the establishment of branch offices in seven rural areas was decided by the members' representatives conference earlier and approved by the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping later.

<p>The Citizens' Association, in order to celebrate the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, scheduled a celebration for New Year's Day of the 20th year. It held a discussion yesterday, chaired by Hu Fengxiang. Zhang Xianfang first reported on the progress of attending the various sectors of the city in preparing for the New Year's Day celebration and discussed how the association should celebrate New Year's Day. It was decided that Zhang Xianfang would still be recommended to attend and participate in the New Year's Day celebration for all sectors. The New Year's Day slogans distributed by the conference would be forwarded to the various district branches to be posted in their respective locations. As for whether the preparatory committee should convene next Thursday, it was decided to suspend the meeting once. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>A public letter from the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau stated: "As this Bureau will be closed for five days from the 30th of this month to January 4 next year, all postal money orders that should be directly paid by this Bureau should be submitted on the 29th and 30th of this month, and they can be registered on the same day. Otherwise, the money orders must be registered starting on January 5. If depositors need to use the funds, they can go directly to the post office specified on the money order to withdraw the funds themselves. Please be informed that the money orders that should be directly paid by this Bureau are listed below: Money orders from Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai, Shandong, Xinjiang, Gansu, Xichuan, and Dongchuan postal districts to Shanghai, money orders with only the words "Shanghai" written on the face, and other Shanghai money orders from postal districts specifying payment at No. 5 Fuzhou Road, this Bureau."</p>

<p>Bonds Will Be Issued to Households Starting in January Next Year</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She stated that the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau previously borrowed property rent for the levy of treasury bonds and Shanghai municipal public bonds, which was carried out separately by the four tax collection offices of the bureau. The number of households has now been determined, and the amount of money</p>
<p>has been collected in full. It has now been decided to end this practice at the end of the year. Therefore, the Finance Bureau has recently ordered the four tax collection offices to rush to collect from all households that have been missed during the daily collection, and report the amount collected to the Finance Bureau by the end of the year for forwarding to the Municipal Government to complete the procedures. If households delay payment by the end of the year, the collectors will collect the money again from January 2 to 5 of the 20th year. However, the end will be at the end of this year no matter what. The bonds that should be issued are now stored in the bank and are planned to be issued to households starting in January of the 20th year. However, the minimum denomination of these treasury bonds is 10 yuan, and the minimum denomination of the municipal public bonds is 5 yuan. The property rent collected from each household may vary, making it difficult to handle the odd amounts. The method of handling this is still under discussion.</p>

<p>Documents, etc., Were Transported to Nanjing Yesterday by the Yi Sheng Warship</p>
<p>After the Naval Organization and Disposal Office was ordered to be abolished, all completed documents were handed over by yesterday, along with dozens of boxes of naval files from the Northern Government era, for transportation to Nanjing by the Yi Sheng warship. The former personnel of the office will be transferred to Nanjing for placement after the National New Year holiday. It is said that Ren Guangyu, director of the Bureau of Military Affairs, has been internally appointed as a naval counselor and will take up his post in Nanjing at the beginning of the year. As for the future establishment of institutions, there are three opinions: (1) The establishment of a main port command; (2) The establishment of a Shanghai naval office; (3) The establishment of no institutions at all. As Chen Shaokuan also holds the post of director of the shipyard, the Second Fleet Command may move into the shipyard to manage naval affairs in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The above three opinions will probably be decided after the State Council meeting next Monday.</p>

<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations stated that freight transportation is very smooth because the current situation is stable and it is the end of the year, and inland stores need a large amount of goods. Locomotives and freight cars are sometimes insufficient. At the request of various freight forwarding companies, freight special trains have been added starting last week. The amount of goods transported to other places every day has almost doubled compared to the past. Therefore, the goods piled up like mountains in the freight yards such as McGinness Road Station and South Station have been greatly reduced recently.</p>

<p>Jiang Han Customs River Patrol Director Bai Announced: According to the documents, the markings in the North Channel of Zhangjia Island will be changed. Therefore, in addition to submitting the matter to the Jiujiang Customs Superintendent for approval, the changes will be implemented on approximately the 22nd of this month. The details are listed on the left for the information of all ship owners: (1) The Ba Li Jiang Kou lighthouse will be discontinued; (2) The Ba Li Jiang Lower Section lightship will be installed. The lightship will have two red, constantly lit lights hanging directly above it. The lightship is located at South 42.5 degrees West from the Ba Li Jiang Kou lighthouse, with a distance of 23% of a nautical mile; (3) The Ba Li Jiang lighthouse will be lit. The lighthouse will have two constantly lit lights, one red above and one white below, hanging directly above it. Navigation Guide: Upstream vessels should be approximately 15% of a nautical mile away from the right bank of the river and proceed along the bank until the Ba Li Jiang Lower Section lightship is visible at North 48 degrees West, and then turn to pass the lightship with the starboard side of the vessel approximately 5% of a nautical mile away from the lightship. Then, take the road to pass the Ba Li Jiang lighthouse at a distance of approximately 5% of a nautical mile from the shore, and proceed at this distance until the Wang Jia Ba lighthouse is directly next to the vessel, and then turn outward to take the road to pass the Zhangjia Island North Port lightship, with the port side of the vessel approximately 5% of a nautical mile away from the lightship, and then take the road towards the pagoda on the Jiujiang riverbank. Follow this navigation guide. The shallowest draft in the route was 33 feet on the 15th of this month, while the number recorded on the Jiujiang water gauge was 14 feet and 3/10 of a foot.

<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau, after receiving a copy of the "Regulations on the Inspection of Passports of Foreign Nationals Entering China" issued by the Executive Yuan after forwarding it to the Municipal Government, was also limited to establishing an inspection office within four months from the date of issuance of the order to implement the inspection of passports of foreign nationals entering the country by Chinese police officers before they are allowed to land. The order was issued on August 22, and the implementation period was December 22. Director Yuan has repeatedly convened department meetings to make meticulous plans. However, the matter is of great importance. Shanghai is a major commercial port, and the inspection of passports of foreigners entering the country will be more complicated than in other ports. The allocation and qualifications of personnel must have considerable knowledge and international etiquette to be competent. The number of personnel required is also not something that can be handled by just a few people. It is difficult to get them into compliance without considerable training. Other matters related to funding and organization also require budgeting. The original deadline has passed, and the office cannot be established immediately. It is currently being requested that the opening be postponed.</p>

The resolution was to forward the case. (3) Chen Jiamo, a supervisory committee member of the Fifth District Party Headquarters, submitted a case concerning Xu Yanfu, who was leading the sale of opium and poisoning society, requesting that the government be consulted to punish him according to the law. The case had already been forwarded, and the resolution was to retroactively approve the forwarding. (4) The County Agricultural Consolidation Committee submitted a request for financial assistance, seeking discussion. The resolution was that since the committee already had a monthly budget of one hundred yuan, they should practice frugality. The requested assistance could not be approved. (5) The Training Department proposed drafting a concise regulation for the County Party's Patriotic Speech Competition, seeking revisions. The resolution was to approve the revisions and pass the regulation.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal New-Style Laundry Industry Guild previously had a dispute because it sent personnel to collect fees from its member, Huishe Company, causing a misunderstanding. The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce specially convened both parties yesterday for mediation. Representatives from the New-Style Laundry Industry Guild, including Luo Zheng Lin Zhi Kun Huishe, and from Huishe Laundry Company, including Hong Yao Ze, were present. Sun Qi Jun attended the mediation on behalf of the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce. According to the reports from both sides, the incident was caused by the guild's dismissal of a worker, Li Bingyan, and led to a misunderstanding. Both sides presented the situation of that day. The Municipal General Chamber of Commerce representatives provided various explanations, and the following results were decided upon by both sides: (1) Regarding the dismissal of Li Bingyan, it would be best if Huishe Company could accept the guild's mediation. Otherwise, each party could handle the matter on its own. (2) Regarding the membership fee, Huishe Company should pay it in full before January 10th.

<p>Listed in Five Points</p>
<p>Liu Maochu, Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Court, submitted his opinions on prison improvement yesterday, stating that the quality of prisons is related not only to the lives of prisoners but also to the observation of both domestic and foreign parties. Therefore, although prisons in the East and West are extremely strict, treatment and management strive for appropriateness and are worthy of emulation. In recent years, our country has been keenly focused on rectifying prison administration, but progress has been difficult due to financial constraints. He has been ordered to inspect the Jiangsu Second Prison on a monthly basis, and the equipment situation has been reported and reviewed repeatedly. He has long been aware of the situation. He now respectfully presents the improvements that should be made in the prison, along with additional opinions, as follows: (1) The prison was originally planned to hold 800 inmates, but the number of inmates has now increased to double that. The original two workshops have been converted into communal living rooms, each accommodating hundreds of people, all of whom are serving short-term sentences or are military detainees awaiting trial. The overcrowding is not only a risk for the spread of malicious diseases but also defeats the purpose of imprisonment as a punishment. The solution is to quickly expand the prison facilities or, first, transfer military detainees to other locations. Inmates who meet the conditions for parole should be granted parole to encourage them to reform and change their ways, in line with the original intent of reformation and to avoid overcrowding. (2) The prison originally had seven or eight types of workshops, but they have now been converted into prison rooms. Except for the women's prison, the others have been shut down, and instructors are unable to teach due to the excessive number of inmates, leading to perfunctory efforts. Without work, inmates sit idle all day, and their spirits are dull. Without instruction, they are influenced by what they see and hear, and their will deteriorates day by day. Thus, it is difficult for them to become good citizens after their release. Therefore, it is necessary to find ways to restore the original workshops, assign work, and have instructors rotate daily to provide training. In addition to work and training, they should be allowed to freely read beneficial books. This will not only relieve the inmates' boredom but also allow them to improve themselves and become healthier. (3) The prison holds over 1,500 inmates, and the number of deaths this year has reached 150. Although this may be due to the inmates' weak physical condition, hygiene and medicine must also be improved. The prison used to have two Chinese and Western doctors, but the Western doctor has been dismissed, leaving only one Chinese doctor. It is inevitable that one person will be perfunctory in treating the entire prison. In the future, more doctors should be hired to cope with the situation. In addition, the inmates' diet, bathing, and the ventilation and cleaning of the prison rooms must be carefully attended to so that the inmate mortality rate can be reduced. (4) Many of the prison walls are cracked, and the window panes are broken. It will be difficult to block the wind and snow as the weather gets colder, which will not only affect hygiene but also increase the risk of prison breaks. If repairs are not made quickly, the harm will be significant. (5) Among the prisoners, there are quite a few who are detained for opium addiction. This practice should be improved because the purpose of detention is to restrict freedom and reform. If non-violent opium addicts are housed with ordinary criminals, they may not benefit from reformation but may instead be infected with bad habits. They should be detained separately so that they can quit as soon as possible. The above five points are all significant. Are they feasible? It is appropriate to prepare a document and submit it for review. It is said that Shanghai is observed by both domestic and foreign parties. Mr. Liu is further planning to expand the prison facilities. Before a large amount of funds is available, he still advocates first opening a section that is better than foreign facilities to detain foreign prisoners and those banned from leaving the country.</p>

<p>Raffia Bag Cloth Industry: The Raffia Bag Cloth Industry Guild held its first inaugural meeting yesterday at the original address of the Shantang Guild Hall at No. 3 Xiaolujia Lane, Dadongmen. Seventy-seven representatives from the industry attended. The meeting began at 2:00 PM with due ceremony. The temporary chairman, Cai Zhi, reported on the reorganization process, followed by a discussion of the articles of association, which were unanimously approved. Next was the election. Because many members are illiterate and find it difficult, according to past practice, the election was conducted by prior written ballot at home, which was sealed and submitted to the meeting for voting. Mr. Hu Yu, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, believed that this was illegal and that other guilds might follow suit and cause problems. Therefore, the election was reconducted. However, to avoid the above-mentioned difficulties, members registered, and others wrote on their behalf, which took a long time. As a result of the election, Gu Youjun, Pan Zigong, Fang Jisheng, Cai Zhijiong, Sheng Yunzhao, Pan Shizhi, Ding Rongzhang, Zhang Baofa, Sun Dafu, Wang Yongsheng, and Sheng Shaoshan were elected as the eleven executive committee members. They then discussed the previous guild's practice of dividing members into four classes—Fu, Lu, Shou, and Xi—based on the size of their capital and the amount of membership fees they paid, and decided to change them to the four characters Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. Vegetable Industry: The Vegetable Industry Guild convened its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. Xia Jiaojiong was elected as the temporary chairman, and Wu Fu presided on his behalf. After the chairman's report, election ballots and a list of member names were distributed. Li Xiuling and Xiong Zhensheng were designated as ballot readers, and Zhou Zi and Hu Jizhou were designated as ballot counters. Under the guidance and supervision of Zhang Yu and Er, the first executive committee was elected. As a result, Chen Shudi, Zhang Heling, Cai Jinsheng, Cai Fusheng, Zhou Zuoyan, Huang Guankun, Zhang Shaoting, Zhao Shunqing, Zhao Cisun, Xia Wenlan, Chen Liansheng, and others were elected as the eleven executive committee members, and Zhang Degui, Cai Lilou, and Li Xinggen were elected as alternates.

(2) Regarding the hiring of Changye as a legal consultant, it was resolved to retain the matter. (3) Regarding the preparation of the guild's fund, it was resolved that Hua Yang and Hua Mei companies would advance 130 yuan per month from December to May of the 20th year (1931), to be returned upon expiration, with monthly fees deducted as usual. (4) Regarding the designation of committee members to draft industry regulations, it was resolved to designate Chen Shouzhu, Zhou Jingchu, Sun Jiangzuo, Wu Jinzhang, Wang Yongkang, Luo Zheng, and Song Jiazhou as the seven members of the drafting committee. (5) Regarding the guild's five-day holiday for the Gregorian New Year, it was resolved to approve. (6) Regarding the distribution of work from the industry, it was resolved to retain the matter. (7) (Confidential) The rest is omitted. Bean and Rice Industry: The Bean and Rice Guild convened a meeting of all committee members and industry representatives the day before yesterday, and the proposed events are as follows: (1) It was proposed that among the guild members in the northern part of the city, those far away in Zhabei find it inconvenient to travel back and forth, and a northern office should be set up to handle trivial matters nearby. The members in the southern part of the city are nearby, and there is no need to set up an office. However, since the construction of the rice market wharf in the southern part of the city, the affairs have doubled, so a southern office should also be set up to assist everything. The northern and southern offices are limited to handling trivial matters and will report the handling situation to the guild at any time. The larger matters will be decided by the guild, and the guild will issue office regulations for compliance. (2) Regarding the stamp tax, there have been arbitrary penalties for industry members recently, and how to deal with this was discussed. It was agreed that the difficulties of the industry and the reasons why they cannot afford to affix stamps to the grain bills should be stated in writing to the Stamp Tax Bureau, and representatives should be sent for oral explanation and negotiation. (3) Regarding the Industry Guild's Committee for Maintaining Industry Regulations requesting to send representatives to jointly petition the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Mu Ouchu, Cai Yukun was publicly recommended as a representative.</p>

<p>Rushing to Produce Firecrackers for the New Year</p>
<p>Sudden Explosion While Packing into Wooden Boxes</p>
<p>Collapses Five Houses</p>
<p>Two Dead, Nine Injured</p>
<p>Around 11:00 PM the night before last, an explosion occurred at the Datong Firecracker Workshop at No. 4 Yufuli, Shijian Tou, south of the Scissors Bridge behind the Nanshi Station Road District Court. Due to improper packing, there was a sudden explosion, destroying a total of five houses and killing or injuring more than ten male and female workers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rushing to produce firecrackers day and night: Chen Yishun, nearly forty years old and a native of Yancheng, runs the Datong Firecracker Workshop at No. 4 Yufuli, Shijian Tou, south of the Scissors Bridge behind the Nanshi Station Road District Court. Business is booming. As the Gregorian New Year is approaching, Chen is seizing the opportunity to hire female workers to produce the most popular firecrackers for the New Year, such as "shuaipao" (whip firecrackers) and "qianpao" (coin firecrackers), in preparation for sale during the New Year to earn a profit.</p>
<p>An unexpected disaster in the middle of the night: Around 11:00 PM the night before last, as the workers were working hard, a group of them were preparing to pack the finished goods into wooden boxes for sale. Due to improper sealing of the wooden boxes, all the firecrackers suddenly exploded. With a loud bang, the explosion shook the surrounding area and completely collapsed two houses in the workshop and three neighboring houses, trapping all the workers inside.</p>
<p>Fire trucks to the rescue: After the incident, people nearby heard the alarm. Fortunately, the Station Road Police Station of the Second District Police Department was nearby. Patrol Officer Ma Deshan led many police officers to the scene. They urgently used the telephone to report to the Second District Police Department and the South District Fire Department. Soon, fire trucks from various routes arrived one after another, and they actively dug and rescued the trapped workers.</p>
<p>Investigation of the number of dead and injured: After about an hour of rescue efforts, a total of eleven injured men and women were pulled out. Two of them died due to their severe injuries. The lightly injured included Hu Liansheng (male, 11 years old, Yancheng native), Hu Genxiao (female, 14 years old, Yancheng native), Ji Dashunzi (male, 12 years old, Yancheng native), Ji Xiaoshunzi (male, 10 years old, Yancheng native), Zhang Shoukang (male, 37 years old, Yancheng native), Zhang Tan's wife (60 years old, Huai'an native), and Zhang Xiaobao (female, 17 years old, Huai'an native). The seriously injured included Liu Gao's wife (30 years old, Huai'an native), Chen Xiaosanzi (28 years old, Huai'an native), Hu Xueyu (17 years old, Yancheng native), Gen Rong (12 years old, Yancheng native), Zhang Yeqi (17 years old, Yancheng native), Hu Wang's wife (37 years old, Yancheng native), Zhang Jiang's wife (27 years old, Huai'an native), and Zhang Yuehong (24 years old, Huai'an native). One of the deceased was Dai, the wife of Xu Jiancheng from Yancheng (20 years old, Yancheng native, died at 2:00 AM yesterday morning from severe facial burns). The other was Zhao Song, the four-year-old daughter of neighbor Liu Yongkang (died on the spot from burns to the chest and abdomen).</p>
<p>Court examination of the body yesterday: At the time, the police officers of the Second District Police Department sent the injured to Shanghai Hospital and Xin Puyu Hall for treatment. They also ordered Gu Tiyun, the local bailiff of the Twelfth Ward, to report to the District Court for an examination. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Lei and others arrived at the scene for an examination and ordered the families to collect the bodies. Chen Yishun, the owner of the workshop that caused the accident, has been arrested and handed over to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Suspicious Youth Arrested and Shot <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Carrying Two Paper Packages</p>
<p>Full of Reactionary Leaflets</p>
<p>At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, Chinese Constable No. 354 of the French Concession's Dazimingzhong Police Station, while on duty in front of Cheng Yuan Tobacco Shop at No. 94 Zhubaoshan Road, suddenly noticed a youth looking flustered, seemingly darting out of the shop. Upon seeing the constable, the youth appeared alarmed and ran away. The constable immediately gave chase, eventually catching up with the youth in a small alley on Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession. The youth turned around and started fighting the constable, attempting to escape. In desperation, the constable drew his pistol and fired a shot at the youth's lower body, hitting his leg. The youth fell to the ground and was immediately taken to the Public Concession police station. After a brief interrogation by the chief of police, the constable was instructed to take the youth to the Dazimingzhong Police Station, and then transferred to the Lujiawan General Police Station. The two paper packages left behind by the youth were examined and found to contain reactionary leaflets. The youth only confessed to being a thief. Further investigation will be conducted after he recovers from his injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e115">American Silver Ingots Arrive in China <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Contributing to the Decline in Silver Prices</p>
<p>According to the World News Agency, starting in early December, Japanese mail ships and others began shipping large quantities of silver ingots from the United States to China. Japanese mail ships alone have shipped four or five times, each time carrying about 300,000 ounces of silver ingots (approximately 100,000 yuan). In addition, ships such as the Da Lai also carry considerable silver ingots each time. This export of American silver is the result of the disposal of silver ingots from the American private silver agreement. The decline in silver prices is also one of the reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e116">"Rented Wife" Abandoned Midway <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Sues for Alimony</p>
<p>Resulting in a Rescheduled Hearing</p>
<p>Zhang Yucheng, a Ningbo native, rented Xie Sanzi, a widow, as a wife, according to Ningbo customs, because his wife was infertile and extremely jealous, making it impossible to take a concubine. He hoped to have a son. However, as soon as Xie became pregnant, Zhang's wife learned of it and led a group of women to beat Xie severely, causing a miscarriage. Xie then sued Zhang and his wife in the Special District Court for assault and battery. The defendant, Zhang Yucheng, hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend him. As a result, the case was dismissed on the grounds that the plaintiff's evidence was insufficient. Xie has now filed a civil lawsuit, claiming that according to the "rented wife" contract, the rental period was three years, and the monthly rent was 15 yuan. Because Zhang abandoned her midway, she is destitute and asks the court to order the defendant to pay alimony. Zhang again hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to defend him. The case was scheduled for trial yesterday afternoon. Both parties arrived in court as summoned. Lawyer Zhan then requested a rescheduling, and although the opposing party objected, Judge He granted the defendant's request and ordered a postponement for a later hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Unsuccessful Divorce Agreement, Filing for Divorce <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Shen Cuijuan Not Tolerated by Husband's Family</p>
<p>Has Received No Money for Two and a Half Years</p>
<p>Divorce Agreement at Hotel Fails</p>
<p>Shen Files a Lawsuit Hoping for Divorce</p>
<p>Cai Zilin, a native of Ningbo residing at No. 519 Fuqing Lane, East-West Huade Road, works on a ship. His father used to be a compradore on a Taikoo Company ship. He hired Shen Cuijuan, a woman from Zhenjiang, as his wife. People from Ningbo are deeply superstitious, especially women. After the betrothal gifts were exchanged, Cai's father suddenly went blind. Cai's stepmother, Qiu, blamed the daughter-in-law for having a bad fate. Not long after the marriage, Cai's father lost his job as a compradore, further increasing the stepmother's hatred of the daughter-in-law, calling her a "white tiger star." Later, Zilin had a falling out with his stepmother and moved out with his wife, and their relationship gradually improved. However, it did not last long, and they had disagreements. The summer before last, Zilin left his wife and went to Hanzhong alone, not giving her any money for two and a half years. Shen lived on borrowed money. Around the tenth month of the lunar calendar, Cai's cousin, Hu Zifu, suddenly visited Shen, saying that he had been entrusted by Cai's mother to advise her to divorce. Shen believed that her husband had not supported her for a long time, and having a husband was the same as not having one, so she agreed. They chose a lucky day and went to Room 28 of the Huishan Hotel in Ti Lan Bridge to hold a divorce. They decided to have someone write two copies of a divorce agreement, but Zilin suddenly regretted it and refused to sign, so the divorce agreement could not be realized. However, Shen believed that this matter was not a child's play, and Zilin had venereal disease, so if they lived together again, she would be infected. Therefore, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special District Court, requesting a divorce and ordering the defendant to return the 120 yuan she had borrowed and to pay 600 yuan for 30 months of living expenses that he had abandoned. The court hearing was held yesterday morning. After the plaintiff Shen Cuijuan made her statement, witness Hu Zifu described in detail the process of negotiating the divorce with both parties, saying that the reason for the sudden change of heart was that Shen did not hand over the items that Cai wanted back, so Zilin was unwilling to sign. When questioned, the defendant Cai Zilin denied entrusting Hu to propose a divorce to the plaintiff. Cai's stepmother, Qiu, also appeared in court and stated that she did not ask Hu to mediate, and that this matter was purely caused by Hu's meddling between the two parties. She hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend her. Judge Xu Wenrong instructed both parties to go outside and try to reconcile. The case was adjourned for a later hearing.</p>

<p>Could Be Received in the United States</p>
<p>According to the American Radio Corporation, from 11:15 PM to midnight the night before last, music broadcast by radio stations in Shanghai, Tokyo, Manila, and Honolulu could be received by American radio stations. The American Broadcasting Company broadcast to various locations. On the Shanghai side, Mr. Zhu of the Datong Music Society played an elegant performance, which was automatically transmitted from the Sassoon Building to the 40-kilowatt generator in Zhenru, and then broadcast to the United States. In addition, Japan, Manila, and Honolulu each played their own national music. However, according to a Washington dispatch from the Associated Press of America, they were unable to hear the music broadcast from China, which is somewhat disappointing.</p>

<p>Finance Bureau Requests Investigation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Finance Bureau previously reported that a rogue named Ma Linbao dared to impersonate government officials in the Tanzigang area of West Shanghai, swindling and extorting money from boat owners. After sending personnel to investigate, it was confirmed to be true. However, the rogue had already fled upon hearing the news. It is now reported that in addition to sending a letter to the Public Security Bureau, ordering them to strictly arrest the criminal and bring him to justice to deter troublemakers, the Finance Bureau has also issued a notice to all boat owners, informing them that they must recognize the official certificate with a photograph issued by the bureau's boat donation office when dealing with government officials. When paying donations, they should be sure to receive a boat donation license and a stamped or bureau-sealed receipt to avoid being deceived and suffering losses.</p>

Yesterday, the Japanese trading company Mitsui Bussan in Shanghai received another batch of Korean ginseng, a huge amount, valued at five to six million yuan. When the ginseng was imported, Mitsui's agents paid taxes and completed customs clearance procedures. The tax alone paid by Mitsui yesterday was over 380,000 taels of silver, which shows how much the goods were. It is understood that the goods arrived in Shanghai to avoid the new tax on New Year's Day and were rushed to be loaded and shipped. If they had arrived a week later, they would have had to pay more than 100,000 yuan in taxes.</p>

<p>Ms. Xiao Xin'an sent a letter yesterday to the Overseas Chinese United Association and the Shanghai Women's Association, saying: "I respectfully acknowledge receipt of your telegram. Xin'an is unfortunate, having met with disaster midway. I am deeply grateful for your righteous support. I recently heard that many of my compatriots in Singapore have been driven out because they tried to assist Xin'an in avenging her humiliation. Fellow passengers on the ship dared not help me, which is why this happened. Relying on strength to bully the weak—where is the justice? Not only has my disgrace not been redressed, but it has also burdened other overseas Chinese. Moved by your kindness and righteousness, I must obey your instructions and come forward. However, I cannot yet determine the date of my departure. Xin'an's elderly mother regards Xin's humiliation as the greatest misfortune for our family and has already fallen ill. If those thugs continue to escalate, Xin will certainly not allow the matter to end there. The reason I have been clinging to life for a few days is for my elderly mother. Soon, I will share my experiences from this trip south, as well as the knowledge that my female compatriots should have for prevention and the responsibilities we should embrace in our careers, with all circles, so that we may avoid repeating my mistakes. I do this to repay the enthusiasm of your support. Then I will end Xin's life with death. Writing this, I am overwhelmed with grief and cannot express all that is in my heart. Because of financial constraints, I was unable to reply by telegram. I hope you will forgive me. Xiao Xin'an bows."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Indian Girl Killed by Car <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Gao A'wu Fined Two Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The seven-year-old daughter of Indian Ah Mai Xing was fatally injured on Yangshupu Road by car number 2092 driven by driver Gao A'wu on the evening of the fifteenth of last month. The police have detained Gao and turned him over to the Special District Court. The court ordered him to be detained while the circumstances of the accident were investigated before further questioning. The Indian, grieving deeply for his daughter, has hired lawyer Fan Gang to file a lawsuit demanding legal punishment and to bring a private suit seeking damages of 10,000 taels of silver. Judge Xiao opened the trial yesterday. According to police lawyer Zhang Tianyin, at the time of the accident, someone witnessed the Indian attempting to cross the road to take a tram. In the middle of the road, one of her leather shoes fell off because it was too big. The Indian girl turned back to pick up the shoe, just as the car was speeding by and could not stop. As a result, the girl was hit by the car. However, this witness is unwilling to testify in court, so this report cannot be trusted. However, according to the vehicle regulations, cars should drive slowly wherever trams pass, but the defendant was still driving fast, which constitutes negligence. He also submitted a map of the accident scene as evidence. The defendant firmly stated that he did not intentionally cause the accident. Judge Xiao reviewed the evidence and ruled that Gao A'wu should be fined 200 yuan. The number of days in custody can be used to offset the fine at a rate of two yuan per day. If imprisonment is substituted, it will be calculated at a rate of two yuan per day. The attached civil suit was transferred to the civil court for trial.</p>

<p>Yesterday at around 11:30 AM, the Ruiji Flour Company on Arab Street ordered driver Ren Dezhou to drive truck number 3220, registered with the municipal government, to transport rice to the French Concession. Unexpectedly, while driving on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, an old man and a young man were walking slowly ahead. Ren attempted to turn and pass them, but the car was too large and could not avoid them. The young man was knocked down, and the rear wheels ran over his waist. He fainted on the spot. The old man fell to the ground and cried bitterly. The police on duty arrived and took the injured man to the Pushan Hospital for treatment, but the injuries were too severe, and he died without receiving treatment. The police then detained the driver Ren Dezhou and the old man and took them to the Fourth District Headquarters. According to the old man's statement, his name was Wang Fengtai from Yancheng, and the deceased was named Shi Qiaoxing, who was my nephew-in-law. He had just gotten married recently. Today, we went to visit relatives. Who would have thought that disaster would strike so close at hand and he would be killed by a car? However, the driver did not honk the horn. A strict investigation should be requested. The chief then ordered that they be handed over to the bureau for interrogation and ordered the local leader to report to the court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Commissioner Lei arrived to conduct an autopsy and confirmed that he had been run over and killed by a car. He ordered the family to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>

<p>The sea bandits outside the Wusongkou digging area, near the towns of Zhen and Tao and Ping, have been causing disturbances again. The night before last, they fired rapid cannons at the seaside as a warning to see if there were any precautions taken on the shore, plunging the villagers, who had just calmed down, into panic again. Yesterday morning at around 4 AM, a large number of bandit boats suddenly arrived at Nankan Port. Without asking any questions, they surrounded more than ten fishing boats, including those of Zhang Shunlai, Ge Yuting, and Xu Qianfa, and set them on fire. Fortunately, the fishermen all lived on the shore and were not harmed. However, fearing the bandits' violence, they all dared not go there and could only sigh in despair at the sea. Therefore, the various ports there have invisibly entered a state of closure.</p>

<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The Fourth District of the Jiangsu River Police Bureau, acting on a tip that a gang of river bandits from the Jiangbei area, led by Gu Ziheng, was hiding in the Gaochang Temple area of Shanghai, purchased information from the district and dispatched special agent Zhang Zhaoxiang, leading a number of detectives, along with the informant, on a small steamer to Gaochang Temple. There, they joined forces with Gao Hongbao, a police officer from the Gaochang Temple Police Station of the Second District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and patrol chief Zou Tieshan.

<h3 id="e128">Lottery Den Busted in Lan Ni Du <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday at 11 AM, a dockworker named Li Xiaoxizi went to the Third District of the Pudong Municipal Police Bureau to report that a secret lottery den with a listening device had been set up in house number 15, Taiping Lane, Houshi Qigan Lane, Lan Ni Du, luring people to gamble, causing great harm to the local people. He requested that they be arrested. District Chief Zhang Mingqin, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered patrol chief Wu Ruixiang to lead police to the address for arrest. They apprehended Chen Yuanmo and Wang Shanqing, seized 58 lottery tickets, gambling funds of three yuan and forty cents in silver, four cents in small silver coins, and eighty copper coins. The witnesses were also taken to the district for interrogation. According to Chen Yuanmo, he was 35 years old, from Yangzhou, and lived at house number 2, Lujia Du. He stated that he worked for Song Deming as a boatman and that he was not the one who did the lottery. Wang Shanqing stated that he was 38 years old, formerly a policeman in the third precinct of the first district, and currently lived in Song Deming's house. He said that Song Deming was writing the lottery tickets, etc. While the district chief was preparing to hand them over, Chen Yuanmo's wife, Li, claimed that Li Xiaoxizi's father, Li Guangtao, was eating red pills, which was also illegal. Harboring a fixed idea to avenge her husband, she brought Guangtao and his smoking paraphernalia to the police station. The district chief considered that Li's accusation against Li's father for eating red pills was made with malice and had solid evidence, so he decided not to send him over. As for Li Xiaoxizi, who did not shy away from resentment and reported the lottery listening device, ridding society of a scourge, his actions were proper and he was commended in person. Chen Yuanmo, Wang Shanqing, Li Guangtao, and others were all sent to the General Bureau for interrogation and investigation.</p>

<p>Shen Changke, a 20-year-old from Hai'an, who lives outside the Xiaonanmen Qinglong Bridge in the Nanshi area and makes a living pulling rickshaws, urgently needed to return to his hometown due to important matters at home. Yesterday afternoon at around 3 PM, he arrived at the 16th Pier to board a ship. He suddenly met a fellow villager he did not know, named Huo Chengzhang, who was serving as a soldier under the First Division of the National Revolutionary Army. Huo approached him and said, "I am a soldier and can buy you a half-price ticket." Shen, hearing that he could get a bargain, was very pleased. He immediately gave Huo one yuan in silver to buy the ticket. Unexpectedly, Huo left and never returned. Shen waited for a long time without seeing him and realized he had been cheated. He was very upset and immediately rushed ashore, searching everywhere. He found him in a small alley, grabbed him, and reported him to Kong Yubin, the guard officer of the Fourth Station there. He was taken to the First District Headquarters, where he was ordered to be temporarily detained pending investigation and review.</p>

<p>Unwilling to Return to Her Husband</p>
<p>Zhang Jinchao, a 32-year-old from Gaoyou, makes a living farming in his hometown. He hired a Zhou woman from the same village as his wife seven years ago through a matchmaker. The Zhou woman, now 27 years old, gradually saw that her husband's family was in dire straits and had no production. She was very frustrated. Zhou's uncle, Liu Wenzhong, a 40-year-old carpenter whose wife had died early, was also looking to remarry. He saw that Zhou was still quite attractive and took the opportunity to seduce her. Zhou was also very pleased, and soon they fell in love. In September two years ago, they fled together to Shanghai under the pretext of working as hired laborers. They lived together on a boat in Dongjiadu, living like husband and wife. Before long, she was secretly pregnant, and her belly gradually grew. In August this year, she gave birth to a daughter. Unexpectedly, good things rarely last. Their secret union was discovered by her husband, Zhang Jinchao, who immediately came to Shanghai a few days ago, staying with relatives in Hongqiao in the western suburbs. After investigating the address in detail, he went to Dongjiadu at around 5 PM yesterday and found Zhou. He forced her to go home, but she refused to comply at all costs, resulting in a major conflict. Lu Rongchang, the guard officer of the 16th Station, saw the commotion and arrived. After learning the details, he took them to the first sub-station of the first district for the director to review and handle.</p>

<p>The Seventh Factory of Fuxin Flour hired Cao A'tang's dock boat the day before yesterday to load 1,200 bags of flour. It was berthed outside the Hubei steamboat at the Taikoo Company's Pier Number Three in the French Concession. During the night, the Hubei steamboat began to weigh anchor and sail, and Cao's boat was immediately moved to the outside of the Taiyuan steamboat at Pier Number Four to berth. Not long after, the Tongzhou steamboat docked at Pier Number Three. Suddenly, the back propeller opened. The current was very strong, causing Cao's boat to capsize and lose more than 300 bags of flour.

<p>Since our country has been strictly enforcing opium prohibition, there has been a provision in various places to reward senior police officers with a percentage of the fines imposed by the courts in opium cases. This has been implemented for many years and has been very effective. The Shanghai District Court has clearly calculated the fines imposed by the court on the various district police stations of the Municipal Police Bureau from January to October. According to regulations, 50% of the funds will be set aside as rewards, with the court deducting 30% and the remaining 20%, approximately more than 3,000 yuan in silver. The Bureau Chief of the Municipal Police Bureau, Yuan, has sent a member to the court to collect these funds and distribute them to the senior police officers of various districts who have solved opium cases, as ordered. Yesterday, an order was issued to all subordinates to bring the instructions for handing over opium cases to the accounting office for collection and distribution as a reward.</p>

Ding was hit in the head, injured, and fell to the ground. The assassin immediately fled. The patrol police arrived and took Ding to the police station and then to Renji Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died on the previous day. The hospital notified the police station, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue for an autopsy. Yesterday, the Criminal Division of the French Police Station ordered detectives to inform the deceased's mother, Ding Wang, to come to the case. Judge Zhu, an adjudicating official from the French Concession, arrived at the morgue at 2:30 PM to examine the body, sat in the official position, and questioned the victim's family. He ruled that the deceased Ding Zhixian was indeed assassinated before his death. The family was allowed to prepare a coffin for burial themselves. The police were ordered to take photos for records.

<p>Chen Jisheng, a local who worked in a foreign firm, committed suicide by taking poison in the Hongfa Store at house number 111, Mintiniyin Road, in the French Concession. His body was taken to the morgue for an autopsy. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that Chen opened room number 14 at the store on the 20th and stayed for three nights. Chen paid six jiao and six fen for the room and gave one yuan per day, including tea and wine tips, so the waiter treated him like an honored guest, serving tea and water with extra care. When Chen got up to leave the store on the 23rd, he told the waiter that if he did not come by 10 PM, the room could be sold. However, after 10 PM that night, the waiter did not see Chen arrive and gave room number 14 to another guest. At 11 PM, Chen returned to the store and was given room number 28 on the third floor to sleep in. Unexpectedly, Chen suddenly had a suicidal thought that night and swallowed poison. The next morning, the maid entered the room to empty the chamber pot and saw Chen smoking a cigarette, acting normally. But at noon, the waiter called Chen to get up and knocked on the door, but there was no response. He forced the door open and found that Chen had died. The store owner, Yang Guoliang, reported to the police, who took the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue for an autopsy. No family members were found.

<p>Letter</p>
<p>To the esteemed Chief Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you because I recently read a news item in your newspaper's local news column titled "Guangdong Woman Run Over and Killed by Car" that slightly deviates from the facts. I am writing to request a correction to conform to the truth. My mother, Du You (not You Du, presumably a mistake when reporting from the Zhabei Fifth District Public Security Bureau), was widowed at a young age and only had one daughter. Her livelihood was precarious, and she made a living by making and selling shoe uppers. On the morning of November 29th of this year, she returned the shoes to Yiyuan Company. After finishing her business, she took a rickshaw home. When she was approaching Baoshan Road, she was pushed over by someone pushing a cart, causing the rickshaw my mother was riding in, along with the rickshaw puller, to overturn. Not only did the cart not stop immediately, it continued to advance aggressively, intending to escape, crushing my mother's left tibia. Fortunately, a passerby surnamed Lu saw what happened and chased back the cart. He immediately called the police, and the cart puller, Wang Er, was taken to the Fifth District, then transferred to the General Bureau, and finally to the Local Court. My mother was first admitted to Zhabei Jisheng Hospital, then to the Blue Cross Qianyi Hospital, and finally to Renji Hospital. The Local Court has summoned people several times, but I am a weak woman, and my mother is in great pain in the hospital and cannot be left for a moment. Therefore, I asked my Liang Kui to represent me at the court hearing and request the cart puller and the cart owner to jointly be responsible for compensating all losses. Unfortunately, my mother passed away in the hospital at 7:00 PM on the 23rd of this month due to her injuries. The Local Court has sent personnel to verify the facts and is waiting to summon for handling. The cart puller is still in custody, and the compensation for losses has not yet been resolved. I am afraid that the rumors are untrue. I have always admired your newspaper for upholding justice. Please publish this letter in the correction column to clarify the truth. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully awaiting your continued success,</p>
<p>Du Hengying and Liang Kui, 615 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Research Report on Children's Life Guidance Group of Jiangsu Provincial Experimental Primary School Joint Association (II) <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>B. Taking Autonomy as an Extracurricular Activity Many people believe that children's activities can be divided into two types: in-class and extracurricular. In-class activities take teaching materials as the center, and extracurricular activities take undertakings as the center. In short, children's autonomy regards activities outside the classroom.</p>
<p>In fact, children's activities are whole, without in-class or extracurricular. Why do teachers have to forcibly divide children's whole activities into in-class and extracurricular with logical minds and adult eyes? For example, the activity of children's autumn outing, the collection of prohibited books, the sketches drawn, the diaries recorded, the travel notes written, many of these activities are done outside, some are done in school. How can this straight-line activity be divided into in-class and extracurricular?</p>
<p>C. Children's Autonomy is Preparing for the Future We cannot pre-determine many models based on social goals with adult minds and logical eyes, and produce them in the same way in factory-style schools. It is a pity that under this model-style training, I don't know how many lively children have been sacrificed, and I don't know how many small friends with rich personalities have been maimed.</p>
<p>(2) Organizational Morbidity</p>
<p>A. The Actual Aspect is Too Heavy and Superficial. When Children are a Kind of School Decoration No matter when you enter, no matter which school, you can definitely see some arrangements and the smell of children's autonomy. There are meetings and villages in the name, and you can hear them. In terms of arrangement, there must be several forms and signs about children's autonomy to see. In terms of activities, there must be patrolmen who seem to be on duty but are not, and farces of chaos can be encountered at their posts.</p>
<p>If you are interested and stand for a moment longer, you will definitely see many contrived autonomous activities appearing in your eyes.</p>
<p>If you are interested in asking the authorities about children's autonomy, you will definitely hear unexpected, lofty and great plans and policies vibrating in your eardrums.</p>
<p>B. In terms of Arrangement, Each School Organization, Everyone Should be Thorough and Complete, Neat and Consistent. However, the more complete the autonomous organization, the more it commits the problem of logicalization, and the more neat it is, the more it commits the drawback of mechanization. Therefore, the current general organization has two major problems in terms of arrangement: mechanization and logicalization.</p>
<p>(3) Morbidity in Implementation</p>
<p>A. Forgetting That Autonomy is Based on Children, Recognizing That the Object of Autonomy is Moral Education, Forgetting Children, So All Autonomous Facilities, Organizations, and Guidance Cannot Be Based on Children, Placing Children in a Passive Position, So Many Activities are Mechanized. Activities are Lively, Children are Children Themselves Although there are activities, the children themselves are also at a loss.</p>
<p>D. Not Based on [Children's Needs | Children's Autonomy Each activity must be based on children's needs, then that kind of activity is valuable. However, most schools, in order to make the autonomous organization complete and thorough, disregard children's needs, stipulate various activities, formulate detailed regulations, plan various methods, and then ask children to participate in the activities. May I ask how much educational value this kind of activity has?</p>
<p>(3) Theoretical Basis of Children's Life Guidance</p>
<p>Education is Life, Life is Education We should declare the death penalty for this kind of children's autonomy that is full of morbidity. At the very least, we also hope that he will have a little (die a natural death).</p>
<p>We advocate making children follow their lives and achieve their own achievements. We do not advocate using means to teach children, nor do we want to use magic to drive children.</p>
<p>We want to discover some meeting goals in children's whole activities and are unwilling to prepare meeting goals and take children to create an ideal type for one person or several people.</p>
<p>We only know that education is life and life is education. In order to achieve this goal, we try our best to delve into the center of children's activities and strive for the development of children's lives.</p>
<p>Now, we will make a profound review of the meaning and scope of life and make an accurate analysis of human life. Under this review and analysis, we can see the source of children's life guidance.</p>
<p>However, we will further explain in detail the methods of life guidance, and carefully establish the goals of life guidance. Under the explanation and establishment of these methods and goals, we can see the guide for life guidance activities.</p>
<p>(1) The Meaning of Life Guidance || In the current educational field, life and education are in a state of separation, and the entire education feels that it has lost its vitality. Therefore, education and life should be combined. Education occupies the entire life, so the entire education has the meaning of life.</p>
<p>Education takes life as its object. Life guidance is to make children's current life develop upwards infinitely. Therefore, life should not be separated from education, and education cannot be separated from life.</p>
<p>The current morbid children's autonomous activities are far from life, and life cannot be the center of activities. No wonder children's autonomy is full of mechanical meaning.</p>
<p>(2) The Scope of Life Guidance || The object of the scope of life can be in the entire life, and its content also includes the entire life of human life. In terms of time, there is a trinity of past, present, and future life. In terms of space, there is a trinity relationship of family, school, and society. Children's past life is the family, the present life is the school, and the future life is the society. Therefore, in children's entire life activities, the scope of life guidance should be linked to the past family life, enrich the current school life, and develop the future social life. But the current school is separated from the family and separated from society. How can this kind of unfounded and unrealistic education be called vitality?</p>
<p>(3) Analysis of Human Life Activities in Life Guidance || We will first study the human life based on the modern educationists' method of summarizing human life activities for reference. The contemporary experts who study courses take Babbitt, Sun Shihui, and Ban Lolan as the leaders. They summarize the methods of human life as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Babbitt Summarizes Human Life Activities into Five Aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Language Activities</p>
<p>(2) Occupational Activities</p>
<p>(3) Health Activities</p>
<p>(4) Civic Activities</p>
<p>(5) Leisure Activities</p>
<p>Babbitt's meaning is that language occupies a very important position in the entire life, so it is summarized as a major human activity.</p>
<p>In fact, in the entire life of the school, there are many opportunities for language activities, and language can be learned at any time in various activities.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Fully Develop Beiping Culture in the Most Economical Way <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Guidance Committee Hopes to be Established in January or February</p>
<p>Li Shizeng's Speech in Beiping</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence Central Committee Member Li Shizeng went to live in Xishan after arriving in Beiping. He returned to Beiping at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 22nd). At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, he invited the education and news circles to a tea party at the Beiping Research Conference Room, with more than 20 people attending. Mr. Quan gave a speech as follows:</p>
<p>I am very happy that everyone has come to gather and talk today, and I am also very sorry. After arriving in Beiping, my brother stayed in Xishan for a few days due to fatigue along the way. Some of you have come to visit once or twice. I wanted to visit each of you, but I did not have enough time. Because someone wrote a letter wanting to have a meeting in a short period of time, I invited friends from the news and education circles to talk at the same time today. It is not a tea party to entertain the news media or various circles in general. Friends came to visit, more or less, with a visiting nature, asking about my mission and opinions this time. Many people in Tianjin have asked about this. My brother has no special mission to Beiping this time. I am deeply grateful and uneasy for your welcome. My brother has lived in Beiping for a long time, and Beiping is my second hometown. I often travel back and forth between Beijing and Beiping. I have no special mission, so I should not be welcomed. My brother travels between Beijing and other places. Except for the obstruction of traffic due to the war, I always travel back and forth once every one or two months. Although I have not seen you for eight months this time, it is no different from usual. There is really no problem. However, I am of course happy to meet with friends I have not seen for a long time. It is also because of this separation of eight or nine months that friends have come to inquire. Based on experience, the questions are all about a few things. First, I will give a general answer to the few things I have thought of. If there are any questions later, I will answer them separately.</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of the Guidance Committee for Reorganizing Beiping Culture, I have already answered in Tianjin. Today, I will restate or supplement one point. Beiping is important in culture, which is universally recognized. Everyone has already paid attention to this. In recent times, it can be divided into two items: one is a purely cultural issue, and the other is an issue related to the current situation. There are also issues related to the economy, so it can also be divided into three points. Beiping culture has long been noticed by the general public. For example, paying attention to the preservation of the Forbidden City and other general antiques is one example. About a year ago, Mr. Zhang Puquan, a member of the Preservation Committee of the Palace Museum, suggested to the Central Government to set up a general agency for the preservation of antiques in Beiping. At that time, the Central Government handed it over to Mr. Ye Chucong and my brother for review. Later, because he left Beijing, he did not have time to review it. Half a year ago, Mr. Wu Zhihui proposed to change Beiping into a cultural district because Beiping was the old imperial capital and was easy to seize the opportunity with the reorganization faction as the political center to make it a cultural center reform. At that time, it was fighting, and the Central Government expressed sympathy for this proposal. Because it was about the north, it specifically sought the opinion of Deputy Commander Zhang, who also extremely agreed. At the Fourth Plenary Session, Mr. He Xuechu had a proposal to prosper Beiping. Because the resolution was to review the case together, this case was established. Because Mr. Wu Zhihui, He Xuechu, Ye Chucong, Zhang Puquan, and my brother et al. had a review relationship, it was proposed to set up a guidance committee for reorganizing Beijing culture. Therefore, the former was purely related to culture, and the latter was also related to the current situation. However, since the reorganization faction government collapsed, Beiping has naturally lost its qualifications as a political center and has become a cultural center. However, after the capital moved south, the economy has declined day by day. Now that the provincial government has moved to Tianjin, it is even worse. If we want to preserve the culture, we must also seek economic development. In other words, we will use economic methods to maintain and develop it to become a cultural center. The culture mentioned here is a broad sense of culture, not only referring to education and academics, but also including industry and crafts. Whether Beiping can become a large industrial area in the future, I dare not say at this time. However, the original handicrafts really need to be preserved and promoted. Mr. Wu Zhihui once proposed to actively develop wool fabrics in Beiping, which is one aspect. Therefore, in summary, the guidance committee for reorganizing Beiping culture really has the above-mentioned three relationships: culture, economy, and current situation. This is the entire initiation and process. I hope that the meeting will be established within one or two months, led by the Central Government, to provide a strong and powerful assistance to prosper Beiping. The local government will work together to make progress and make Beiping change into a new atmosphere. And I firmly believe that this hope will be fully achieved. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e152">Education Bureau Severely Punishes Tonghui School, etc. <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>According to the Education Society, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, for the reason that Zhang Xiuxiong, a teacher at the private Tonghui Primary School, accommodated the request of Zhoupu Primary School to borrow the school's athletes, resulting in the death of student Yu Zhenye due to injury, has issued a notice to punish the school board of directors. According to the report, Yu Jingxi, the family member of the school's student, Yu Zhenye, accused Fan Zhixuan, the school's director of physical education, of disregarding the children's physical condition and aggressively training intense sports such as running, resulting in the weakening of his son, Zhenhua's body. Now, due to the school teacher Zhang Xiuxiong accommodating the request of Zhoupu Primary School to borrow many of the school's athletes to impersonate Zhoupu Primary School students to attend the Nanhui County-run school's sports meeting and win the championship, his son was injured and caused the school principal, Tang Guoxun, not to care about it beforehand. The accusation requested separate investigation and handling. After repeated thorough investigations by the bureau, it was found to be true and should be punished separately as a warning to the future. It was found that the school principal Tang Guoxun did not investigate in depth after the teacher Zhang Xiuxiong took students Tang Jingen, etc. to Zhoupu to compete in basketball on October 4th of this year, which led to the occurrence of the conspiracy and fraud on October 18th. Although the school principal was on sick leave at the time, he could not avoid the blame for negligence. He should be ordered to have the school board of directors discuss and report for verification. Fan Zhixuan, the school's director of physical education, did not pay attention to the children's physical condition during normal training. Regarding the competition items, he allowed people to dominate without supervision, which was very wrong. He should be ordered to have the school board of directors transfer the order to the school for discussion and report for verification. Zhang Xiuxiong, a teacher at the school, accommodated the request of Zhoupu Primary School to take students without permission to participate in the Nanhui County sports meeting under false names, conspired to commit fraud, and caused a fatal case, losing his qualifications as a teacher. He should be ordered by the school board of directors to transfer the order to the school to immediately dismiss him. On the one hand, the bureau will separately issue a letter to revoke the teacher's qualification certificate and permanently revoke his teacher qualification. The Zhoupu Primary School principal and the person related to this case will be severely punished by the bureau after consulting with the Nanhui County government. In addition to the separate report letters and instructions, the meeting minutes are now attached and returned with the order, and the school board of directors should immediately comply with the order and submit it for verification. This order also sends letters to the education departments of various provinces and the education bureaus of various cities to permanently revoke Zhang Xiuxiong's teacher qualifications, and consults with the Nanhui County government to request severe punishment of the Zhoupu Primary School principal.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Lu Yiyan Creates Three Kinds of Character Search Methods <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>When Lu Yiyan was editing the dictionary at the Zhonghua Book Company in the Republic of China's 10s, he began to study character search methods. As a result of the research, there are five types. The first achievement is the (Head and Tail Number Character Search Method). This method divides the strokes into ten categories and represents them with numbers. The first two strokes and the last two strokes of each character are compiled into numbers, which is extremely convenient for checking. The New National Pronunciation Student Dictionary compiled with the head and tail numbers has been published by the Zhonghua Book Company and has been popular throughout the country. The third type (Head Character Search Method) This method follows the structure of the characters, counts the head characters and side characters, and divides them into 132 parts. The character positions in each part also use the most popular and simple methods to fix and improve the standard of the radicals. A small dictionary of national pronunciation has been printed by the Zhonghua Book Company and will be published next spring. The third type is (Up and Down Number Character Search Method) This method divides the strokes into nine categories and represents them with numbers. The top two strokes and the bottom two strokes of each character are compiled into numbers. The method is novel and the check is convenient. Now, a book of character strokes has been compiled and has been typeset and will be published next year.</p>

<p>丨A group of sixteen people...led by Mr. Ma Yuehan丨</p>
<p>丨Will compete with Jinan University on the 30th of this month丨</p>
<p>The Tsinghua University Football Team, which dominates North China, arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou yesterday and is staying at the Jiande Storage Society on Fusheng Road. They will meet the Jiangnan football champion Jinan University Football Team at the Chinese Baseball Field on the 30th. They will return to Beiping on January 5th. Those who came to visit include Shi Changli, a veteran tennis player from North China, and Fei Lu, a teacher from the school, among others.</p>
<p>Athletes with Many Talents</p>
<p>The Tsinghua Football Team consists of sixteen people, led by Ma Yuehan, who is both the team leader and coach, and captain Huang Zhongfu and left inside defender Xiao Difei. They represented the North China team last year. In September of this year, when the Liaoning charity football competition was held, all the so-called famous generals and athletes of Hebei were recruited, and this team had the most selected players, including Huang Zhongfu, Zhang Guowei, Xiao Difei, Xian Zhongfen, Huang Gongyang, Tan Bao, and Huang Yujia. The team players are tall, strong, and fast. The speed of the forward running, the accuracy of the shooting, and the comprehensiveness of the internal defense are all outstanding. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>(Goalkeeper) (Inside Defender) (Center Defender) (Forward)</p>
<p>(Xiao Difei) (Huang Kailu) Zhang Tianzhu</p>
<p>(Jiang Qingen) Zhang Guowei Chen Yi He Ruyi</p>
<p>Zhao Yansheng Xian Zhongfen Huang Zhongfu (Shi Duan) Shen Chonghui Huang Gongyang Tan Bao Lu Huang Yujia</p>
<p>Team Leader and Coach: Ma Yuehan, Secretary: Liu Desheng, Captain: Huang Zhongfu</p>
<p>Great Reputation in Hebei</p>
<p>The Tsinghua Football Team has superb skills and a great reputation in the Hebei area. This year, Tsinghua, Yanjing, Shida, Fu Jen, and Peking University organized the Five University Sports Federation. Among them, the football event adopted a two-week competition system. The result of the first week was that Tsinghua ranked first. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name　Matches Played　Wins　Losses　Ties　Score</p>
<p>Tsinghua　Five　Four　Zero　One　Nine</p>
<p>Yanjing　Five　Three　Zero　Two　Eight Fu Jen　Five　Two　Two　One　Five Shida　Five　One　Four　Zero　Two Peking University　Five　Zero　Five　Zero　Zero</p>
<p>This time going south, they played against a combined team of Jinling University in Kyoto and took a clear advantage. Within the enemy's half of the country, they attacked at will. It was fortunate for the enemy that they were unable to break through and score. Yesterday, they played against the Soochow University mixed team in Suzhou. They took the lead with one to zero in the first half and won three to one in the end. The team's performance at that time was well received by the audience. They will face off against Jinan soon, and Shanghai fans will flock to see the skills of the northern athletes.</p>

<p>Aftermath of the Yuehua Amateur Issue</p>
<p>The Xie Jin Association Must Have a Firm Position</p>
<p>Cao Guicheng, the leading right winger in the national football world, was suddenly disqualified from the Hong Kong Westerners Football Club for participating in the China Long Distance Team organized by the Yuehua Sports Association. Cao, with his superb skills, was unable to achieve his ambitions in Hong Kong, so he came to Shanghai alone, hoping to contribute to the Shanghai football world. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Westerners Football Club also showed signs of rejection. Facing this desperate situation, Cao had no choice but to return to his hometown and decide his next move. He is scheduled to return to Hong Kong this morning on the Russian Imperial Liner. Cao's position is the same as that of other Yuehua players, and the amateur issue of Yuehua players has been reviewed by the review committee of the China National Sports Association, which found that there was no violation. However, it still awaits the final decision of the association's board of directors. If the resolution is the same as that of the review committee, it is hoped that the association will make a serious statement and implement its decision, so that they will not be treated differently under the same flag. In other words, the innocent heroes will not have their talents buried.</p>

<p>3:00 PM at Shen Park</p>
<p>The Zhenru Football Team played a Senior Cup game with the British Navy yesterday. The two teams will meet again today for a Grade A game, starting at 3:00 PM at Shen Park on Jiaozhou Road. With the skills gap, Zhenru can surely win. However, if the Navy fights hard as it did in the second half yesterday, it will be a different story. The referee is Warden. The lineups of both sides are roughly the same as yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Zhenru Eliminates the Navy <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Three to Zero, Zhenru Wins</p>
<p>Senior Cup Two-Week Tournament</p>
<p>The Zhenru Football Team played a Senior Cup two-week tournament with the British Navy yesterday afternoon at the Chinese Baseball Field. As a result, Zhenru won three to zero, and the British Navy was eliminated. Three to four thousand spectators watched the game, which was a great event.</p>
<p>(1) A Glimpse of the Two Teams' Formations</p>
<p>Zhenru's lineup yesterday was the best for the team. The British Navy was almost the same as the one against Lehua the day before, so the outcome was expected. It was just a matter of the score. In the first half, Zhenru was triumphant and controlled everything. The Navy was seen scurrying around. In the second half, the formation changed, and the Navy also frequently invaded. The enemy's traces almost shook the goal, but the clowns jumping around did not achieve anything. Zhenru also did not achieve much. Therefore, the score in the first half determined the outcome. The Zhenru team performed well overall, but not as well in the second half as in the first half. The lineups of the two teams are listed below:</p>
<p>Zhenru Team</p>
<p>Liang Guanlian Feng Yunyou Jiang Shanjing Lin Songfa Chen Zhenhe Zhuang Shihong</p>
<p>Chen Bingxiang Luo Guanghai Dai Linjing Chen Jiaqiu Mei Hongbao</p>
<p>British Navy</p>
<p>Haimen Smith Cox Ashmon Robertson Hinston</p>
<p>Gore Crawford Huiai Tuole Xu Nadingge</p>
<p>(2) Zhenru Scores Three Goals in a Row</p>
<p>After fifteen minutes of melee, the referee Maxwell blew the whistle. The British Navy kicked off. After one or two circles, Luo Haiguang took the ball away but was intercepted. Suddenly, the forward lost his footing, and the Navy attacked twice, but both times it was calm. Zhenru also attacked repeatedly but failed. Mei Hongbao shot but missed. Chen Bingxiang failed to catch the ball. After fifteen minutes of melee, the situation suddenly changed. When everyone was bored, Chen Zhongjian came from afar and kicked the ball. Center forward Dai bumped forward and picked it up. The Navy goalkeeper Haimen pushed it up, and Luo Haiguang headed it in. The ball was in the net. With one goal scored, everyone cheered and their spirits were lifted.</p>
<p>With the way open, the momentum surged. The Zhenru players attacked the enemy and scored another goal, but it was disallowed due to offside. After waiting five more minutes, the ball came from Luo to Mei Hongbao, who passed it forward. Chen Jiaqiu, with his swift feet, went straight in and Haimen had to wait for his death, resulting in a score of two to zero. In less than two minutes, Chen Zhenhe passed to center forward Dai, who sent it to the right wing. Mei Hongbao accurately made it three to zero. The first half ended like this.</p>
<p>(3) The Navy Sighs at the Goal</p>
<p>Suddenly, at the start of the second half, the situation changed, Zhenru failed to attack, and instead frequently received empty scares from the Navy. Dangerous situations were often seen. It was almost the Navy's last stand. The Navy had no less than ten chances to attack the goal. However, they lightly sent the opportunities away and the shot was either inaccurate or flew over the goal. If the shot had been accurate, the situation would have changed dramatically. After forty-five minutes of melee, nothing was gained and the game ended.</p>
<p>The offside restricts the five forwards, and some may wonder about the different situations of Zhenru in the upper and lower halves. First, they charged in one breath and then weakened slightly. Second, they had already won three goals and were sure of the victory, so their fighting spirit was relaxed. The most important thing was that the referee's offside whistle blew continuously, startling the Zhenru five forwards so that they dared not enter the line, and they were too cautious, so they did not achieve anything in the second half. This was the main reason.</p>

In the second half, French Electric tried their best to resist, and the situation improved. However, in the last five minutes, they lost another goal due to a penalty kick, resulting in a score of four to zero. Xinxin won. The referee was Zhang Longhai.</p>

<h3 id="e166">The Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Is Becoming More Beautiful <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the actual sales of cotton yarn have been exceptionally brisk, and all sectors have shown signs of excitement. One reason is that the factory exit tax will be implemented on January 1, and the goods currently arriving at the destination can be exempt from the tax of five or six yuan, so customers are vigorously searching for spot goods to ship. Second, the bottom goods are too scarce, and once there is good news, the rising trend becomes more intense, and people's hearts are stirred up. Retail investors show signs of panic, so the market is in chaos. However, Japanese and Chao businesses have not changed their minds about short selling, but outsiders are competing to buy, making the market relatively dry, and the rising trend is becoming more intense. In the afternoon, there were rumors that the British factory Yihua had opened up more than 10,000 packages of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd, and the market suddenly fell by one or two yuan at the close.</p>
<p>The Marked Yarn Rises Sharply, the Market is Quite Firm Before the Bid, the Situation is Tense. The actual sales of this month are smooth, and there are more buyers.

In the afternoon, due to the brisk actual sales, the enthusiasm was even tighter, and each rose by one or two yuan. At the close, there were rumors that Yihua had opened up more than 10,000 packages of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd, and the market suddenly fell by one or two yuan. As a result, the near month rose by two or three cents, and the far month fell by two, three, and five cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 53,800 bales.

<p>The cotton market is firm due to the remaining energy of the short squeeze the day before. Buyers are increasing their purchases, and most retail investors are wary of short selling due to the short squeeze last month. As a result, the market is tense, and the yarn market is lively. The market sentiment is also extremely boiling, but spot cotton transactions are quiet.</p>
<p>The Han Standard Continues to Rise, the market atmosphere was flat when the Han Standard opened in the morning. Due to the lack of sellers on the two or three plates, each rose by one or two cents.

<p>Yesterday, more than 30 river boats arrived at Zhabei, and sales from all sides were still acceptable. The inventory of northern japonica rice was quite large. Although the buying was similar to the previous day, the price had already stabilized, so there were no ups and downs in the high secondary market, and the transaction was also very smooth. The market for thin indica rice tended to be weak, and the source was continuous. The market for sheep indica rice was stagnant in the high-selling market, and the price fluctuated by half a cent. The market for Dubu indica rice was very stable, and the main sales channel was local retail sales. The top boat opened at about 12 yuan. The customer market for the yuan suspension was enthusiastic, and the boats arrived very close, so the market was flat. The yin trend was stagnant, and the general market lacked rise and fall.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than a dozen boats arrived at the inner roads of South Shanghai, and the street shop's appetite for sales was uneven. Due to the lack of high-quality goods, the ordinary changxi northern japonica rice was more active, while the middle and secondary japonica rice from the Suzhou gang was not selling well. The prices of each grade were fixed. The special high chang rice opened at 13 yuan 23 jiao. The arrival and sales of the early indica rice from the south gang were both flat. The current market price of this product is not expected to change much within the year. Not many sheep and dubu indica rice boats arrived, and the river inventory was also flat. The shop sales picked up high-grade goods, and the market price was stable. The customer market for the yin yuan had no resistance, while the arrival and sales of the west road and the south road were slightly weak, and the middle and secondary grades were slightly cut back.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month was sluggish. The quotation for foreign wheat the day before only showed a slight improvement, but the overall environment and the amount of foreign wheat fixed by the manufacturers actually exceeded the standard thrown. At first, some manufacturers thought of holding on, but as the situation became worse, they painfully sold it to protect the future import of foreign wheat. The year 19 is coming to an end, and at the beginning of the year 20, there is a fear that there will still be a period of decline. As a result, January was lower than the previous day by 7.5 li, February was lower by 1.25 fen, March was lower by 7.5 li, April was lower by 1.5 fen, and May was lower by 1.5 fen. Although the auction for this month has been stopped, there is no news about the delivery warehouse receipts.</p>

Dutch No. 8 red sugar was transacted sporadically at 7 taels and 7 or 8 qian. Daily sugar is still in high demand, and the market inventory is low, so the price is gradually rising.

<p>Since the economic turmoil in the New York market, silk factories have been reducing machinery and suspending operations, and the sales of raw silk have been greatly reduced.

Foreign red cloth such as Five Pound Tian Ji brand rose by 3 qian and 5 fen, bleached fine cloth rose by 6 qian, and bleached cloth rose by 1 or 2 qian to 5 or 6 qian. The items sold include: (Taixi satin) 16 boxes and 470 pieces, (Yuan velvet) 17 boxes and 340 pieces, (Yuan straight tribute flannel) 2 boxes and 50 pieces, (Yuan Fu silk) 8 boxes and 240 pieces, (Pure wool straight tribute) 1 box and 4 pieces, (Feather silk) 146 boxes and 5,220 pieces, (Yuan color cloth) 2 pieces and 80 pieces, (Blue cloth) 9 pieces and 320 pieces, (Bleached fine cloth) 15 pieces and 750 pieces, (Foreign red cloth) 2 pieces and 120 pieces, (White foreign yarn) 3 pieces and 150 pieces, (Bleached fine cloth) 5 boxes and 250 pieces, (Bleached cloth) 67 boxes and 3,350 pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Oil Market: The Rising Trend of White Tung Oil Has Been Suppressed <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market condition of white tung oil was that foreign firms were closed, and there was no news from the Han market. According to the detailed information in the Han letter, the goods on the road continued to arrive in Han, so customers' thoughts gradually softened, and the rising trend has been suppressed. Xiangtung customer plate is still 17 taels and 2 qian to 4 qian, and Sichuan tung is still brisk, but it is rarely sold. The white tung oil produced in Zhejiang has always been transferred to the Han market, so the market sentiment has turned flat. However, the current year-end is approaching, and traveling merchants are in urgent need of funds, and they are competing to sell, and the sales plate is accommodating, resulting in varying sales prices. Judging from the general trend, there will be no major changes in the oil market within the year, and the outer plate will generally close at 18 taels.</p>

<p>English galvanized iron of sizes 24 to 31 has been out of stock for a long time, and the market inventory is weak. As reported in this newspaper earlier, 2,285 bundles of spot goods of sizes 24 to 31 have arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf, which are said to be orders from hardware stores in the North Suzhou Road area. Therefore, the market prospects will definitely be lively in the future.</p>

<p>The transaction of English tinplate has been suddenly smooth recently. Customer gangs such as Sichuan, Hankou, Henan, and Tianjin have successively purchased goods, and canneries in this street have also added a lot of embellishments. Therefore, 1,700 to 1,800 boxes have been opened in the market in the past two or three days, but there are few goods left in the market after the purchase. Therefore, the market is flourishing. It is estimated that each box (90 pounds) is 14 taels and 2 qian and a half, which is about 2 taels higher than before, and 100 pounds can be estimated to 15 taels and 2 qian and a half.</p>

<p>General Erich Ludendorff of Germany, in his new book, says that based on the current military situation of European countries and scientific calculations, World War II will definitely begin on May 1, 1932. It will start with a conflict between Italy and France and spread throughout Europe. Germany will be the battlefield. After the book was published, some people scoffed at it as nonsense, but many believed that Ludendorff was a key figure in the European War and must have research value. The following is a translation of the main points:</p>
<p>The Course of the War France will unite with Poland, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Romania, and other countries, with a total of about 12 million people. Italy will unite with Germany, Austria, and England, but the number of people will only be about 18 million. The war will last about six weeks. France and Poland will win a great victory. On the first night of the war, the bombers of France, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other countries will destroy all the most important cities in Germany. Austria and other countries will also be ravaged by France and Poland, and the Tyrol area will be occupied and a military government will be established. France and Italy will join forces on the plains of southern Germany. The most important Ruhr area in Germany will be occupied by the French army eight days after the start of the war. The German government will move to Kiel, where British troops will land to command the military affairs of northern Germany, which may avoid the trampling of the French army. In the fifth week after the start of the war, the French and Italian armies will determine the outcome.</p>
<p>The War After the War Although France and Poland are victorious countries, they will not be able to enjoy the blessings of victory. Because the Soviet Russia is lurking behind, it will raise a large army. The number of people will be between 600 and 700 million, and there will be 100 million Turkish troops to help. Poland and Romania will bear the brunt. From the Baltic Sea to the Adriatic Sea, France and Russia will begin to fight. At this time, the people will suffer greatly from the war and will definitely rise up in revolution. The United States will also be affected by the European war, and wars will occur repeatedly. The whole world will be reduced to a barbaric area.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Suzhou Park Goldfish Exhibition · Zhi Wei <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The goldfish exhibition is a creation that has never been seen in thousands of years. It is said that the motive for launching this exhibition was that Suzhou Park added 30 to 40 display tanks this year. The park staff member Wu Ziji personally supervised the fish farmers to take good care of the fish. The fish have become fat and have unique characteristics. So Mr. Fan Yunshu, the director of the park, discussed with Mr. Wu Guanghan, the director of the Education Bureau, and went out to solicit famous species and prepare for half a month, borrowing glass tanks and arranging the locations, which took a lot of effort. Unfortunately, it rained all day on the originally scheduled 20th and 21st, and tourists were reluctant to come. Fortunately, the third day was sunny. From morning to night, tourists gathered, reaching thousands of people. For a time, shoulders rubbed against each other, and there was almost no place to set foot in the East Studio and West Pavilion. It can be said to be extremely grand. Now, I will write about what I have seen and heard to tell the fish farmers.</p>
<p>The fish positions in this exhibition are divided into two places: the fish garden and private homes. The fish garden is in the East Studio. All the goldfish gardens in Wu joined the exhibition. There are not a few famous species, but it is a pity that there are few items that are more than three years old. The West Pavilion is a private product, including Jin Zhizhi of Dongshan, Bao of Shizi Street, Sun of Sijing Lane, Xu of Daru Lane, Ding of Gongyuan Road, Zhao of Hulong Street, Xia of Yan Yamen, Bao of Xiahou Bridge, Zhou of Furenfang Lane, Zhang of Goose Neck Bay, Zhang of Guandi Temple, Wang of Caojia Lane, Yang of Dawei Lane, Xia of Daxin Lane, and the park itself, etc., no less than dozens of families. There are no less than 20 or 30 kinds of names. Now, I will record what I can remember as follows. (1) Silver egg upturned gills, white, flower. (2) Silver egg water bubble eyes, white, flower. (3) Dragon species pompon, red, white, flower. (4) Egg species pompon, flower. (5) Dragon species upturned gills, red, white. (6) Foreign egg species, flower. (7) Foreign dragon species, flower, white, yellow, blue. (8) Heap meat fish, red, white, flower. (9) Pearl fish, red, white. (10) Swallowtail fish, red, flower, white. (11) Lion head egg species, red. (12) Upturned gills water bubble eyes, red, flower. (13) Dragon species pompon upturned gills, red. (14) Celestial dragon, red, yellow. (15) Celestial dragon pompon, red. (16) Heap meat pompon, red. (17) Foreign egg pompon, blue flower. (18) Purple dragon species. (19) Blue dragon species (20) Swallowtail heap meat pompon, red (21) Dragon species white, red, flower. (22) Egg species white, red, flower. (23) Black dragon (24) Egg species foreign dragon, flower.</p>
<p>On this day, the best items in the exhibition were the (swallowtail) (foreign egg) (foreign dragon) (water bubble eyes) (black dragon) produced by Mr. Xia Luping of Yan Yamen, and the three eight-year-old old fish. According to one of these three fish, it is a tiger head species, which is rare in recent years. Because this fish has been around for a long time, it is impossible to match it. Even if you want to match it, this species has disappeared. Its preciousness can be imagined. The other two fish, one is an egg species and the other is a water bubble eye, are both eight years old, with fat bodies and bright red color, making them the chief of the entire exhibition. The items collected by Mr. Xia are all three to five years old, and Suzhou is not comparable to Beijing. The (water bubble eye egg species) of Jin Zhizhi has a graceful posture like a painting. The two bubbles are like beans, and the color is also good, making it the runner-up of the entire exhibition. The Wang family in Caojia Lane has a very long history of fish farming. Everyone who plays with fish knows it. What is displayed today is (flower dragon species), and the physique, eye corners, and color are all top-notch. It is a pity that other small species are not listed in the exhibition, which is regrettable. The (heap meat) (dragon species, upturned gills) (flower pompon) of Mr. Bao Jiemi of Shizi Street are perfect, but they are all young plants of the year, which is a pity. The (celestial dragon) of the Bao family of Xiahou Bridge is unsurpassed and can be called top-notch. The (upturned gills silver egg) (red and white dragon species pompon) of the Sun family of Sijing Lane are indeed extraordinary. Unfortunately, they belong to young fish like Bao Jiemi. Other details are not described. Please forgive me. I think the second goldfish exhibition will have more to watch. Please wait and see.</p>

<p>Burmese customs have a water-splashing ceremony when the rainy season is about to arrive (around March 15 of the lunar calendar). Water is splashed for three days. When the rainy season is about to end (around September 15 of the lunar calendar), a fire-lighting ceremony is held. Each household hangs candles for three days to mark it. These are the two major ceremonies of the year. After the rainy season ends, it never rains again until the following year. The climate is dry and warm, which is considered winter. However, after the dry and warm season, around February and March of the lunar calendar, it is summer. The heat is abnormal, which people find to be bitter. After summer comes the rainy season.</p>
<p>The terrain in northern Burma is mountainous. The mountains bordering Yunnan are the source of the rivers. Therefore, minerals are produced. The rivers are turbulent and not conducive to navigation. The central part has many fields. To the southern downstream, there are very few mountains, and it is entirely a swamp. Water transportation is very good. The water is deep and the waves are calm. Even small rivers are very deep, which is beneficial to wheel boats. However, the water level rises and falls regularly, unlike China's abnormal heights and lows. Therefore, the residents' thatched houses are mostly located near the waterfront, built on the water, to enjoy the convenience of bathing without the danger of being washed away. Men, women, and children are all good at swimming. When the sun sets in the west, the river is full of pairs of swimming fish, and men and women come to bathe. This is the most enjoyable time for the Burmese.</p>
<p>Commercial power is controlled by women. Women are all able to read and calculate. They are diligent, clean, and love beauty. Therefore, it must be known that Burmese customs value women and despise men. This is because women are the center of ethics. Women have an obligation to be filial to their families and parents. Many men marry into their families. Therefore, marrying a Burmese woman requires assuming the obligations of her entire family. This must be known. The reason why they despise men is that men grow up and either become monks and leave home, or marry into other families and leave. They cannot support their parents or support the family. Therefore, they are despised. This custom is exactly the opposite of China's. Although this is not the world I advocate, where women transform and become equal, the submission of the male can be said to be very small in Burma. And after a man enters the woman's family, he enjoys the right to divide the property. If the woman's family has property, the man can also enjoy it. It's like a middleman marrying a woman. Alas. Love is the root of suicide.</p>
<p>A thousand sails pass by the side of the sunken ship. Why criticize the plane for aviation carelessness? Ten thousand trees bloom in front of the dead tree. Just shade for future generations, and plant good trees by hand.</p>

<p>There is a way to please everyone. There is no policy that pleases everyone. There is a war that wins every battle, but there is no army that never loses.</p>

<p>Pilgrimage to Italy Diary</p>
<p>(3) Ten Days in Rome (10) (5)</p>
<p>June 4, Day in Europe: Great Cathedral of St. Peter｜Vatican Palace｜Sistine Chapel｜</p>
<p>After lingering and sighing in this great cathedral for a long time, we walked through the colonnade to visit the Vatican Museum in the backyard. Before we arrived at the museum, we had a general look at the entire scale of the Royal Palace. The surrounding palaces and towering buildings were scorched by the Roman sun under the dry blue sky, shining with a rare golden yellow, and in every glittering place, the sacred majesty of religion was revealed. On the left and right of the palace gate, there were several layers of armed guards. These guards were too strange and cute. Everyone looked like the "Golden Leopard" performed on the Shanghai stage, wearing (red) (yellow) (green) various colors of mixed and different uniforms, and wearing a gold chain like a rosary between the legs wrapped in blue, red, and red cloth. Holding a long spear in his hand, the stem was painted in vermilion and the tip was bright silver. It looked very heroic and mighty. This is to tell us that the Pope is inviolable.</p>
<p>Walking along the Royal Palace for more than ten feet to the end, we stepped into the Vatican Museum. Immediately, I raised the deep taste of my research. This museum is different from other museums in Rome. The entrance fee is five lire per person. It is said that this is the Pope's income. In Rome, all places under the jurisdiction of the Pope require a fee.</p>
<p>After entering the door, we walked into the rectangular corridor. The visitors gathered and blocked the road. At this time, our hearts were only anxiously waiting. Especially me, I was really as happy as entering a treasure trove. This kind of interest is rarely seen in my life. Ascending the stone steps to become a broad corridor, the walls on the left and right and the ceiling are painted with brightly colored stories of the Virgin and Christ. It is a kind of glue painting fresco. The cabinets on both sides display the treasures used by the popes of the past. Foreign gifts, Egyptian handicrafts, many small wooden statues, and many decorative arts. Relief. Ivory carvings, etc. Most of these are things left by Egypt and Greece for thousands of years. I didn't have time to examine them one by one at this time. I only felt that in this unfolding new situation, every item was not surprising. There was also a room inside, which was also full of valuable items such as gold, silver, and jade. There were also many religious documents. The surrounding decorations were also extremely gorgeous. What was painted on the walls was neither heaven nor hell, but very lively animals (ducks) (doves) (peacocks). Or delicious grapes. From this, it can be known that the source of beauty has already turned from taking the grade to the fields and paying attention to observing nature. Especially surprising is that some frescoes are indeed very similar to the frescoes in ancient Chinese temples. The colors and brushstrokes also have the same flavor. However, it is not forced at all, but a very natural thing. This is surprising and strange.</p>

<h3 id="e187">A New Method of Teaching Children to Write, Sweeping the Land <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The Nine Brush Methods of Zhuo Junyong</p>
<p>In the context of modern cultural development, the appreciation of calligraphy must also adopt a new perspective. Generally speaking, the writing of modern characters should prioritize simplicity and evenness as beauty, ease of writing as legitimacy, and the ability to incorporate the advantages of various styles as its utmost achievement. In other words, while in the past, only those with leisure and strength could write well, now everyone can be taught to write well.</p>
<p>The term "Chinese characters" does not necessarily refer to the commonly used regular script of recent times. Judging from current trends, a new type of script is bound to emerge to meet this demand. This script will inevitably be very simple, very even, easy to recognize, and easy to write. Those who are mindful of cultural undertakings must have already heard the call for this.</p>
<p>However, before this new script becomes widespread, there is still a need for an improved method of calligraphy to meet current needs. Why? It's not that the currently used regular script cannot produce good writing, but rather that it has been ruined by those who write in the (wuguangfang) style. The lack of attention to calligraphy has been most severe in recent decades. From the very beginning, when primary school students start copying models, they are copying the characters of contemporary officials, which are then carved by printing shops into extremely rigid and mediocre forms. No one can look at them without feeling nauseated. Imagine that those who are just learning to hold a brush start with such characters. Even if they later want to emulate the best, their habits have already formed, and how much further progress can they make? Therefore, starting off with an improper method of writing can be likened to a woman binding her feet from childhood. Once the feet have been bound, even if they are later unbound, walking will still be unnatural. Those who have written bad characters will find it difficult to get rid of their old bad habits. This is speaking for those who have aspirations to improve. If someone doesn't study calligraphy, they will never know their own shortcomings. The decline in Chinese people's handwriting can be seen in various public places. Just look at the street, and the large, resplendent characters of the shop signs and advertisements on both sides, no matter how ornate, are always in a poor and unappealing style. The result of this poor quality is that it fails to attract people's attention, fails to evoke a sense of beauty, and makes it difficult for people to recognize the characters. What a significant loss this is for business!</p>
<p>Japan shares the same writing system as China, but most Japanese people write better than we do. There is no other reason for this than that they have not had their feet bound and have not copied bad models. They start with cursive script, using brushwork close to the Tang dynasty models. This is not the best method, but the result is already much better than ours. The lack of attention to calligraphy not only results in losses in social applications but also poses a major problem in children's education. Think of how precious children's minds are. Other subjects have scientific teaching methods, allowing them to acquire the most complex knowledge in the simplest way. Only in writing Chinese characters do we still use the old, irregular methods, forcing rote learning. How unfortunate this is for children!</p>
<p>There is nothing that cannot be summarized using scientific methods. Therefore, it is not impossible to improve the teaching of calligraphy to promote its advancement. Recently, Mr. Zhuo Junyong created a "Nine Brush Methods," which arose in response to this demand. His basic method is to reduce the various complex brush techniques to the following nine: (1) Dot, (2) Horizontal, (3) Vertical, (4) Left Oblique, (5) Right Oblique, (6) Left Turn, (7) Right Turn, (8) Left Spiral, (9) Right Spiral. These nine brush strokes are all geometric shapes. If further reduced, there are actually only four types: (1) Dot Shape, (2) Line Shape, (3) Angle, (4) Circle. Beginners only need to use the brush to trace these four shapes, mastering them skillfully, and they will naturally be able to write well.</p>
<p>At first glance, his theory may seem too outlandish, but it is based on sound and irrefutable reasoning. You must understand that the reason why Chinese characters can be written well does not lie in the shape and structure of each individual character, but in the brushwork. If the brushwork is proper, the structure can be inferred and applied to other characters. Conversely, if the structure is good but the brushwork is improper, it still cannot produce good writing. Therefore, the foundation lies in brushwork. The traditionally transmitted "Eight Principles of Yong" have some merit, but they are too complex for beginners to grasp and are designed specifically for regular script, not suitable for modern, liberated styles. According to Zhuo himself, these nine methods can encompass the brushwork of various scripts, including oracle bone, seal script, clerical script, cursive script, regular script, and running script. After mastering these nine methods, one can write any of the above-mentioned scripts. This is indeed the special essence of this book.</p>
<p>If primary school students use this as a model, they can achieve at least the following results: (1) They will not rely on established styles and will not be bound by vulgar forms, which is most suitable for children's psychology; (2) The horizontal strokes will be flat and the vertical strokes straight, fostering good habits of hand-eye coordination; (3) They can gradually advance to higher levels and engage in seal script, clerical script, and cursive script.</p>
<p>Not only children but also ordinary people who aspire to study calligraphy can find a simple and easy path to entry. If they enter the door with the right method, they only need to copy one or two steles and rubbings, and they will not have to worry about being unable to write well. Otherwise, even if they practice every day, like the ancients who (darkened the pool with ink), it will still be in vain. I think few people have experienced this kind of suffering. Therefore, what is most needed today in promoting calligraphy is not necessarily good steles and rubbings, but rather a good and simple method of entry. Zhuo's book can indeed meet this need, and its success can be predicted.</p>

<p>But, Bao Jun, it's easy to say, but difficult to do. I don't know if I'm afraid of death, let's not talk about it for now. But, Bao Jun, you know that to shoot myself with a gun, where can I get a gun? I don't have one, so how can I shoot myself? Or I can talk about other ways to die, but, Bao Jun, since I can't love the person I want to love, then my death should be a grand and joyful one. As for hanging and drowning, those are just the actions of women and children. I am not worthy and unwilling to do them.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have another reason that I want to explain to you, which is that I really don't want to die, because I can't bear to give up loving her. Alas, Bao Jun, if she wants me to die, I am willing. If she wants me to be her faithful slave, I am willing. But now, she doesn't even give me a chance to talk to her. Without her attitude being clearly expressed, I can't commit suicide no matter what. I really can't bear to abandon her and commit suicide.</p>
<p>○○○○</p>
<p>I have a fellow villager, Wang Jun, who also knows about this. What he said to me is this: he thinks that I only have two options to take towards that LSUM, and there is no third way to go. One is to actively start an offensive against her, and the other is to absolutely give up this attempt. But, Bao Jun, I feel that both of these methods are impossible now. Giving up my love is better than shooting myself with a gun. Am I that kind of person? Can I give it up? If so, then my writing this letter to you is completely meaningless. That being said, then I should start an active offensive against her, but Bao Jun, I have already told you this before. If I were a courageous person, I'm afraid I would have already thrown myself into her arms. But me, me, Bao Jun, I am originally a coward. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e189">Fragrant Kiss by Xiaotian <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>Written by Zou Fang, published by Caoyehua</p>
<p>In the extremely silent Chinese poetry scene, we are able to read such a long lyric poem as "Fragrant Kiss," which truly makes us feel unexpectedly delighted. This is because recently, there have been hardly any individual collections of poetry published in bookstores. Even if one or two so-called collections of poetry emerge on the silent poetry scene like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, there are very few that can make readers feel particularly satisfied. In fact, it can be said that there are none. This is truly a sign of the decline and lifelessness of the Chinese poetry scene. Those who love poetry are of course filled with endless sorrow. Although, not long ago, various publications paid attention to the selection of poems, most of them belonged to the category of slogans and labels, making us feel only their crudeness, horror, and bloody murderousness when we recited them. They had neither artistic expression nor technical expertise to speak of. These shouted-out poems simply forgot the essence and elements of poetry. This is a fact that everyone admits. The poems in this collection ("Fragrant Kiss") are greatly different. They express without reservation the passionate emotions, rich imagination, and the elements of simple beauty that a poem should have. At the same time, the author's technique has also reached a mature point, which is even more unattainable in the current general poetry. Regarding this, Mr. Fu Donghua writes in great detail in the preface to this collection, writing like this:</p>
<p>"If one were to take the pulse, as it were, and calmly and attentively press down on several poems in "Fragrant Kiss," one would feel that they contain intense emotions like smoldering fire. Such smoldering fire is precisely the quality of a poet, which others cannot force. When the technique of expression becomes more mature, this quality can be developed into the brilliant mark of art. Therefore, I have great hope for the author as a poet."</p>
<p>In this short preface, the special qualities of the poems in "Fragrant Kiss" are analyzed in an exceptionally detailed manner. If we then read the original poem (calmly and attentively), we will feel even more that Mr. Fu's words are extremely correct. However, we cannot deny that the author, as a poet, already possesses the necessary conditions.</p>
<p>Moreover, the author's thoughts are very lofty, which may be the thoughts of a poet. Therefore, in the expression of each verse, he makes every effort to use his artistic skill, not allowing it to fall into mediocrity, no matter what. This is not so novel and pleasing in the expressions of ordinary poets in general. Those who have read this ("Fragrant Kiss") will surely believe it. What the author writes has a strict order. The entire poem is divided into six kisses, and each kiss is further divided into several small sections, but it does not feel complicated at all. After we sing and recite it, we feel that what he writes is well-organized, which is extremely evident. What the author expresses is for the sake of love, but on the other hand, it is filled with an upward consciousness. This is the greatness of the author, which those decadent poets cannot express. Now let's first look at what he writes:</p>
<p>Your cheeks have never been, stained with rouge and white lead,</p>
<p>I love this smile, like a lily just unfolding its petals,</p>
<p>Regardless of what is rippling, whether it is tranquility or joy,</p>
<p>Ah, please, allow me to be frivolous again,</p>
<p>| Or, joy, or, tranquility, (Second Kiss)</p>
<p>Little girl, I love your innocence,</p>
<p>Who says children and adults are different?</p>
<p>(Children can enter the Kingdom of Heaven),</p>
<p>Have you ever heard someone say this? After all, God likes jealousy,</p>
<p>Love has been born, and fallen into sorrow,</p>
<p>I almost want to destroy myself,</p>
<p>Why not wait for me to think about it anew, (First Kiss),</p>
<p>From the two verses cited above, we can see that the author is optimistic. Since he is filled with (joy), the future of course contains unlimited hope. This is truly because the author has a lively and innocent air. He loves nature, and he loves innocent and bright little girls. This is none other than his love and protection of precious childhood, and his hope to strive upwards. This is a kind of symbolic brushstroke. Although he sometimes feels sorrow, he always wants to add a new assessment to these, returning to the new realm of childhood. In the following verses, what he writes about the love of (children) is even more vivid and delightful, but it is mostly filled with joy.</p>
<p>Pour a glass of wine | Drink as much as you can,</p>
<p>Liang, we haven't met for half a year, how rare is today,</p>
<p>I wish you happiness, I wish myself happiness,</p>
<p>East, west, north, south, all are filled with joy,</p>
<p>Joy, joy, joy</p>
<p>I congratulate myself, you celebrate my resurrection,</p>
<p>Joy, joy, joy (Fourth Kiss)</p>
<p>Like these two verses, what is expressed is how powerful, compact, and novel, making us feel endless joy in our lively hearts. This point is very worthy of attention. In general, this collection ("Fragrant Kiss") is a newly discovered lyric poem in the domestic poetry scene that is not easy to obtain. Regarding this, Mr. Zhao Jingshen has said it very clearly in his preface, so there is no need for me to explain it in detail. In my opinion, it is fully meaningful to recommend this ("Fragrant Kiss") poetry collection to readers.</p>
