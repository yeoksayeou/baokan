<p>意奧交歡</p>
<p>前數日報載奧總理史科白赴意。與意相墨索里尼簽定公斷條約。該約即爲訂立重要商約之初步。近又載意相宣佈凡泰羅爾市民前因反對意國同化政策而被拘之政治犯。一律大赦。意奧交歡。此其噧矢。亦即中歐局勢將起變動之徵兆也。</p>
<p>歐戰後奧匈旣分析爲兩獨立國。境地又被削奪。北境斯拉夫族处冭爲捷克斯拉夫國。東境割讓於羅馬尼亞。東南境併與南斯拉夫。南境泰羅爾割與意大利。故奧地利雖於一九一八年。宣布爲新共和國。而其處境。實甚困難。。環繞其國境者。皆爲虎視耽耽之强鄰。財政經濟又感困乏。食糧燃料。多半仰給於他國。幾無法以圖自存。於是從外交方面着手。先倡多腦大聨邦之議。不成則又倡德奧合併之議。然亦爲强國所阻。迄未實現。而其國内之政黨。向以社會黨爲最佔重要地位。近則摹倣意大利之準棒喝黨一派。亦甚得勢。現時準奉喝黨之首領史科白。旣握政權。乃倡議與意國棄嫌修好。以聨意爲暫時圖存之一法。對内可殺社會黨之勢力。對外藉紓小協約國之脅迫。此史氏赴意聨好之原因也。</p>
<p>至於意大利。前旣不惜捨棄三國同盟之關係。毅然加入協約。以抗德奧。今何以又欲與奧國聨好。亦自有故。意國抱侵略野心。數年如一日。地中海爲意大利命運所繫。權利在所必爭。而法意之間。在地中海方面。在在有利益衝突。故今日意大利急急欲與法國爭地中海之覇權也。意國一方面。又向有支配巴爾幹及東歐之野心。與南斯拉夫。時相齮齕。而法國則早已拉攏捷克斯拉夫羅馬尼亞南斯拉夫。訂結爲小協約國以牽制德奧故非特德奧懼爲法國勢力所包圍。而意亦慮東歐方面之進展。爲法所阻。圖謀抵制已久。今日有此機會。可以增厚自己之勢力。故亦幡然變計。以與奧國聨好也</p>
<p>意奧交歐之目的旣如此。固可視爲歐戰後十年來中歐形勢移動之起點。然今日世界潮流。實不宜於棒喝黨專横之所爲。今意奧之結合。以兩棒喝黨勢力爲基礎。希圖逆流向外。其結果亦豈難測哉。</p>

<p>— 憶儂</p>
<p>余影曩客永嘉久。永嘉山水清幽。竹木茂美。每歲至冬月。必偕友人至茶山五美院觀梅。歲月不居。忽忽十餘稔矣。客臘。滬濱大雨雪。扃户高臥。適得甌中友人書。謂永嘉今歲大雪。茶山寒梅。不日着花。約余往賞梅。余閱之心動。意興勃發。次日即乘輪赴甌。時甌中雨雪初霽。纔放朝嶬。簷際餘溜。尚冰掛未消。徑至友家。主人聞余至。喜甚。以爲遠方佳客。來此賞梅。雖雪夜訪戴。亦不是過也。余在友家。暢談一日夜。甚懽。約詰朝人山。晨興。主人已預備花舫。邀舊雨數人偕行。自甌城乘舟。一路湖光山色。快雪時晴。領略風景不少。舟中瀹茗啖果圍爐爲歡。及抵茶山。舍舟登陸。不數百武。即到谷家塘。塘之前後左右。皆植梅花。屋舍參差。溪流環繞。居其中者。大有神仙眷屬之致。是時梅經雪後。花開愈盛。余與友人等且行且住。遠而望之。如姑射山前之積雪。近而望之。如梨花千樹萬樹開。芬芳撲鼻。如入香雪海。或宿幹茁秀。</p>
<p>或新本抽枝。或横斜如臥。或半倚若傾。</p>
<p>綽約多姿。臨風索笑。　枒根錯。尚有殘</p>
<p>雪未消也。主人乃於梅花下。設鐺烹茗。</p>
<p>聨句吟詩。以誌賞梅之勝。賞梅未竟。五</p>
<p>美院僧來。邀入寺中一游。院寺近傍山</p>
<p>麓。水木明瑟。禪房靜寂。是晚又大雪。余</p>
<p>與主人即在寺就晚餐。山肴野　。清馨沁</p>
<p>脾。次晨寺門甫啓。而滿山已成銀世界</p>
<p>矣。余等乃更鼓其觀梅之游興。踏雪尋</p>
<p>梅。仿孟襄陽故事。一至谷宅塘。雪裏梅</p>
<p>花。更形淡艶。新茁梅枝。爲雪所壓。尤顯</p>
<p>旖旎之態。謂之爲香雪海。誰曰不宜。余</p>
<p>等乃各以香雪海命題。分韻賦詩在梅花</p>
<p>林下。賞玩兩日。主人猶依不舍。余等</p>
<p>乃促主人歸。沿途雪花。尚飛入船牕中。</p>
<p>惟見岸旁白鷺。拳立雪汀。遥望古木枯</p>
<p>林。爲雪所罨。似乎樹樹皆梅花。舟中友人。乃以絲竹自娛。余素喜弄詞曲。遂高唱南天門中數闋。友人聞之。咸爲擊節。然余亦自寫其潦倒無聊之概。亦不計佳惡也。舟抵甌城。已萬家燈火。余在甌僅勾留二三日。訪故舊。談素心。有邀余到南雁游者。余以歲莫。急欲返滬辭。友人皆悵悵不置。茲附錄在甌賞梅三絶云。梨雲一抹隱樓臺。恍似羅浮入夢來。頃刻因風飛欲舞。是花是雪費疑猜。漫山香雪眞如海。不待騎驢踏雪尋。處處暗香通鼻觀。幾生修到伴花今。風送花香入酒巵。美人索笑慰相思。那堪紙帳多情月。又爲扁舟照别離。</p>

<p>當　赤色恐怖瀰漫俄羅斯帝國時。舉國騒然。以歷代的奴隸生活。以及非人道的壓迫。養成半獸性的危險的和瘋狂的性格。一旦解放。一方面受赤色思想所薰陶。内心燃燒着復仇的觀念。極易成爲危險人物。一方面世受傳統思想的洗禮。復具原始時代的率樸性質。易爲捨身成仁的偉舉。（鐵蹄紅舞）（	ＨｅＲｅｄＤａｎｃｅ）一片。即描寫我國革命時代之一農家女報復父仇拯救情人的驚天動地之壯劇。同時又把革命時代之性况。赤裸裸地暴露出來。可憐芸芸衆生。犯白刃。流赤血。徒爲少數人造功利。可悲可嘆。赤黨之流毒與貴族之奢暴。一併呈入我觀衆眼簾而無餘。女主角係桃樂絲德里奥。男主角係却利法爾。皆爲鼎鼎大名的明星。聞該片於本月二十六日在巴黎大戲院開映。吾友楊敏時君並爲之出特刊。銅圖文字。琳琅滿目。極爲可觀。</p>

<p>買水購線　自本月二十日夜晚、陳君在浦江被綁消息傳出後、全滬震驚、詳情已迭誌本報、當時曾由公安局長袁良出懸重賞、並訓令所屬、限十日内務期破獲、偵緝隊長喬崧生奉令後、立即密飭所屬各員、一體嚴密跴緝、一面購水買線、不遣餘力、詎前晚喬隊長忽據眼線密報、謂現有是案要犯、匿居公共租界福州路金臺旅館一零五號房間内、請速派員往拿等語、喬隊長據報後、時已深夜、當即輕車簡從、僅帶侍從一人、先投該管捕房、隨即逕往該旅館一零五號房内守候　　過浦救票　隨由喬隊長急電盧英副隊長、統率偵緝員張廣森·符正才·齊海田·單斌·王耀·顧連城·竇玉琳·韓瑞生·朱寳生·韓景祥·劉思玉·吳作榮·侯升漢·王恒山等大批探員、各御鐵馬甲、暗藏武器、並帶同眼線、於深夜十二時十分、由隊出發、乘渡至浦東、時正大雨如注、所經之地、滑濕異常、衆探員均冒雨前進、二時抵浦東三林塘、雨勢更甚、而天又暗黑莫辨東西、衆探員乃蹲伏田内、專待天明、直至五時半、天方破曉、復行前進、未幾即逹藏匿肉票處者、先由眼線指認無訛、報告盧副隊長、</p>
<p>險遭撕票　衆探員逹到目的地、先命眼線辨認清晣、盧隊長遂察看四週、見有新建平房五六間、位於一孤寂院落内、外繞竹籬、四週掘成二三尺許之溝渠、盧隊長即下令分哨扼守各要口、隨即督隊奮勇衝入、按照眼綫所說藏票所在、一直擁入灶披間後房間内、詎匪等已聞警準備、待衆探員抵房間時、内有一匪、即突出手槍、返身先向肉票轟擊一槍、幸未命中、彈由肉票左臂掠過、距離僅三四寸許、亦云險矣、</p>
<p>捨命擒匪　際此千鈞一髮之秋、幸單斌韓景祥兩探員捨命向前、將該匪抱住、將槍奪下、（槍爲六寸新式勃郎林二三二八一三號）餘匪均倉皇竄避床底、時盧隊長在側、亟令先將肉票陳天錫拖救出、時門外探員、均聞槍聲、一齊擁入、衆匪乃一一就擒、計獲男女綁匪七名口、盧隊長命逐一上銬、詎開槍之匪一手上銬時、一手忽然下垂、幸偵緝員韓瑞生在側、見狀生疑、忽將一手執起、再搜檢週身、竟在袴袋内又抄獲六寸實彈勃郎林手槍一支、彈已登膛、一觸即發、其最堪發噱者、即開槍之匪被捕時、尚大呼（我係肉票、請忽誤會）云云、</p>

<p>談判贖價　同行者匪九人、但我入室時、一匪將我眼鏡取下、仍用白布包閉、入室後、第一日匪方並無舉動、看票計六人、第二日日看票中有着藍布長衫者、令我寫信至家屬、信底由匪人起稿、囑我照信謄錄、並問我願出贖價若干、我當即對以我家實無錢、祗可貼補損失費、匪云我等已用去三萬元、我答三萬元、則萬難、若三四千元則可、伊等索價五萬元、着藍布長衫之匪云、匿無此欵、我等即欲殺你、其中有一匪即佯爲解勸云、我們減少一點、你須增加一點、</p>
<p>否則撕票至二十二日隔壁之房间内、匪等所稱之老大、上午四時外出、至下午五時回藏票處所、隨由藍袍之匪與老大接洽後、復進房問我、究竟出價多少、否則即請示於總司令、不要你的錢、即時撕票、我即答增一二千元、至二十三日上午四時、匪之老大又外出、至下午四時許又回、再由藍袍之匪代與該老大接洽、又到我房内云、對你自已說不妥洽、我等到上海去辦、隨取出信稿一件、又命我照鈔</p>
<p>鈔　鈔到滬接洽　我即選得數人名字、匪等均不承認、云他等號主權的、祇要你如寫給何應梅到、可函中所載、大致謂我在匪窟内、有生命危險、請速出外接洽、並不</p>
<p>要與工部局得知、伊說價錢不要講、又隔一二時之久、匪等計議良久、云上海風聲甚緊、倘外邊有别項舉動、先行將票打死、昨晚防範非常嚴密、至今日（二十四日）上午四時、匪方老大又來上海、約六時許、由公安局來員、將我救護出險、此即被綁一切經過情形也、</p>
<p>續獲一匪　當喬隊長在金臺旅館時、亟電知閘北領班王世福蘇升、高萬生、偵緝員高巨川、王佩文、丁順寳等至該旅館守候、直守至薄暮五時許、忽有一頭戴小帽、矮小身材、短鬚、身着元色直貢呢馬褂、嗶嘰長駱駝絨袍、年約四十餘歲之男子、至該旅館詢問賬房、謂一零五號内有人否、問畢、即倉皇出門、時偵緝員適在側、隨即跟踪尾追、直追至雲南路一二九號門口、始被追獲、暫押該管捕房、經捕頭略問一過、據供名葉阿安、（即葉佩文）楊思鄕人、餘供支吾、偵緝員亟用電話報告隊長、候前往迎提、歸案訊辦、</p>

<p>三保太監在南洋ＹＳ</p>
<p>（五）禁食節</p>
<p>每年一到陽曆二三月間、在黄昏六時半的時候、我們便會聽到敎堂裏擊鼓的聲響、這鼓聲是告訴馬來人的飲食的時候到了的在深夜裏的四點鐘、敎堂裏的鼓聲又在警告馬來人斷食的時候到了、假如你不明瞭其中的眞象、那末你會覺得是一椿奇異的事吧、但這却是馬來人的一種風俗、這風俗是呌做禁食節（Ｐｏｅａｓａ）禁食節的開始是在回歷的十二月起到新年日止的、</p>
<p>禁食節原是這麽的一回事、從早上到晚上、飲食是一槪被禁止的、到黄昏六時半、敎堂的鼓聲響過了之後、一君饖餓的馬來人、才得開始飲食、但是飯却仍不能够吃、在晚間十二點鐘才可以吃飯、迨到晚間三四點鐘的時候、又再吃一頓飯、於是便要挨飢到第二天的黄昏了、假如有人不遵守這規例、或受不住餓火燃燎、而致私自偷吃、這個人據說是便要受敎主謨罕默德的懲罰、這種奇異的風俗、我想讀者諸君看到這裏、或許會急於要我講述牠的來源、好吧、靜靜地聽着吧、我開始這樣說了、</p>
<p>在一四○五年的時候、在南洋地方的一羣懶情的野蠻的馬來民族、開台見到大明委來的三保太監的踪跡了、因爲馬來民族本身的弱小、便視大明委來的三保太監若天使一般了、而且三保太監自到南洋後、他們例得到了他的惠賜不少、所以他們是很歡迎三保太監的、馬來人時時稱呼三保太監爲三保爺、三保大人以及三保公、會長是時時欵待他的、但是、存着要把馬來民族一稱打盡的念頭的三保太監、却時時常想出些殺人不見血的方法來、想誅滅一羣愚蠢的他們、於是、他想出了一個方法來了、這個方法是要把馬來民族統統餓死了的、</p>
<p>一天正是回歷的十二月初、三保太監開始利用他的誅滅方法了、</p>
<p>（昨晚我夢見天帝、它對我囑咐你以及你的人民說、在要過新年的前一個月、大家都要絕食、如果有任何人吃了些微的東西、那末、到二年這家人、便要受到全家餓死的災禍、這災禍、便是它的懲罰、因爲天帝的懲罰、是敎人要相信的證據、否則、你們便以爲我撒謊呢、）</p>
<p>三保太監自從對酋長說了這話之後、馬來民族便一個也不敢違背地尊寸而行了、然而三保太監也是跟着他們一樣地要忍受飢餓、</p>
<p>幾天之後、三保太監自已也覺得有些忍受不住了、於是在一天的晚上、他開始私自偷吃東了、有一次、他不知怎的不小心、竟被一個馬來人瞥見他私自在偷吃了、</p>
<p>（三保爺、你不是說過天帝已囑咐了我們在十二月這個月裏要絕食嗎、怎麽你自已却吃起東西來了呢、）那個馬來人這樣地問地、</p>
<p>這時、他實在有些着急、但是聰明的他、便馬上想到了似的說、</p>
<p>（是的、我曾這樣地對你們說過、但是、我也不是爲了受不往餓而吃的、在十二月裏的每天晚上、在繁星出來的時候、我們還可以吃些東西的、）</p>
<p>那個馬來人聽了之後、便開始吃起東西來了、不久個個人都跟着學起樣來了、可是、三保太監的方法又失敗了、自從那時候起、在回歷上、便多了一個禁食節了、</p>

<p>（二）茶館和飯店</p>
<p>走過南京路外灕的人、在匯中飯店沿馬路一帶的玻璃窗中、至少可以望見一對或者幾對的白面挺　的西洋人、在那裏啜咖啡、倒牛乳、尤其在下半天的時候、你可以望見（僕歐）們、穿着　徵無　潔白無垢的製服、雙物捧了銀盤、穿來穿去的侍候着客人、其實進過咖啡館、吃過西餐的人、對於這種形景、原没有可奇的地方、所不同的、就是同一樣的喝茶、在西洋人做起來、必定要滲牛乳、加糖、用小茶匙調攪、用糖夾茶托、種種手續、眞是煩瑣極了、好像嫌壼裏的茶太少、不夠暢喝、非要用各種的方法、來延長他（午茶）的時間不可、</p>
<p>到了同羽春或者日昇樓、茶還是一樣的茶、可是喝的方法大不相同了、㑽官没有一定的制服、好像茶客一個人可以佔幾個人的座位、大家隨意、茶室裏雖没有音樂、客人們合奏的（交響樂）、比了市政廳的音樂、複雜萬倍、茶壼和茶杯碰起來、有（淵淵的金石聲）、吐痰的聲音裏還夾了嗆咳的妙奏、茶博士來冲開水、銅水壼的長頸嘴、離開茶壼口、至少在一尺以上、開水從壼嘴到壼口、中間亮晶晶的、似銀練、似瀑布、至於吃茶總離不了一個（講）字、除了茶水潤喉的時候之外、簡實没有停口的時候、你坐在茶館裏、就　如將你的頭塞在無線電播音機裏一樣、吃茶與人生、大有研究的價值、吃飯與人生、當然更不用說了、大槪每一條大街上總有一所茶館、而每兩條街的轉灣角裏、也總有一處飯店、（飯店）、一個多麽華貴的名字、大華飯店·華懋飯店·利查飯店　　　　飯店多着哩、不、這里所說的飯店、是和上面的茶館相仿的、並不是可以住宿的飯店、有人說、尋飯店不用睜開眼睛、因爲飯店裏總有一股特殊的油味、向鼻孔直衝、開胃提神、兼而有之、飯店裏有油味做引導、確然不錯、那曉得飯店的（自然照牌）、比了任何店家有趣味、有研究、</p>
<p>一家小小的飯店、爐灶的地位每每和他的門口、大小比列不能相稱、規模略大的更不用說了、而且爐灶的地位、决没有藏在裏面的、客人們一進飯店、就看見最關重要的（飯）、所以一到正午十二點鐘、鍋子裏的飯堆得好像一座小山、（開門見山）很可移赠飯店、至於菜肴方面、那就格外的引人注目了、許多飯店裏的菜、總是沿玻璃窗堆放着、人在外面走過、就像一幅巨大的油繪壁晝、張在眼前、油光照眼、色彩濃厚、胃力薄弱的人、對之就不免走避、還有整塊的肉、原隻的雞、堆在别的小菜上面、大有壓倒餘衆的氣槪、餓肚的人走過窗外、那一隻雞霎那間就鑽到他肚裏、喉嚨裏一不自然、脚尖就歪進去了、（自然的照牌）功用就是這樣的、</p>
<p>上海究竟有多少茶館和飯店、從一個小小的統計上看起來、其數之多、一定可以驚人、這一個統計、是閘此一個公安局調查編製的、很有趣味、很有價值、大綱是這樣的、在五十二條馬路上、共有茶館二百十九家、平均每一條街、就有四家茶館、在十五條馬路上、有八十三家飯店、其中包括牛羊肉麵館等所以、平均每一條街上、就有五家可吃的飯店之類了、從這兩點看起來、差不多茶館和飯店、在每一條街上、其數相等、換一句話說、就是居民對於茶館的需要、和飯店站在一樣的地位、再翻過來說、就是有一處飯店、同時也就有一處茶館、或者一條街上、先有了一家茶館、附帶的必須有一家飯店、茶飯、茶飯、眞是拆不開的名詞、</p>
<p>在上面所說的五十二條馬路中間、有一條街比較的最長、所以單統說飯店、就有三十二家、茶館亦有二十六家、茶館和飯店兩相加起來、不是就有六十八家之多麽、居民對於他們的殷渴、很可想見、在二百十九家茶館中間、資本最大的八千　錢、最小的祇有十元、飯店的資本最大五千元、最小二十六元、這大槪是一種約數、因爲無論如何簡陋、十塊錢資本開一家老虎灶式的小茶館、恐怕很不容易、其中開設最久的十七年、最暫的祇有一年、比較完備的茶館裏、有賬房、有跑堂、有爐手等等、最簡陋的祇有老閭一個人、折衝其間、奔走應命、所謂十元資本的、大槪是這樣的光景了、</p>
<p>若然進一步的統計起來、趣味當然也進一步的濃厚、譬如說每一個茶館裏、每天有多少茶客、這許多客人中間、有幾個是常到的、他們各人的生活又是怎樣、飯店裏最需要的有幾種菜、每日的人數、菜米等一定都有連帶的關係、此外各飯店裏飯桶的統計、飯桶年齡的大小等、倒也很有意思的、照普遍的說起來、飯店的地位、較了茶館總要佔些優勢、而茶館的需要、却比了飯训還要緊、前者所以吃飽肚子、後者所以調濟乾枯的生活、還有許多人用以消磨（有涯之生）、上面所說的二百十九家茶館中間、有一家呌做（混一）天一這眞是說盡茶客們的心理了、</p>

<p>美國婦女的都市生活</p>
<p>深花枝淺花枝深淺花枝相並時花枝難似伊</p>
<p>玉如肌柳如眉愛著鵝黄金縷衣啼粧更爲誰</p>
<p>丨丨長相思丨丨</p>
<p>北平新聞記者密雪司他昭實的丈夫</p>
<p>王一之在它的游美隨感裏說、美國是婦女的樂士、　此可以窺見美國婦生的生活、是非常籌適的、不僅是我們中國的婦女過的生活、和她們比較起来有天壤之隔、就是英法德意的婦女、如果和她們的生活比較起來、似乎也不免有上下床之别、所以有些人作滑稽的口脗說道、美國的婦女、尤其是都市間的婦女、是頂在男子的額角上過生活的、這句話雖然不免於容過甚、却不得不認爲是一種淋漓盡致的描寫吧、</p>
<p>美國婦女、尤其是都市間的婦女、差不多都是拜金主義的忠實信徒、所以她們有時是明而明之、兼着拜金主義的使命去幹她們的勾當、誠然、說什麽社交、簡直就是拜金主義化的社交、說什麽戀愛、簡直就是拜金主義化的戀愛、據美國賈爾思說、（美國在最近的二十年來、離婚案綜共要不下四百萬件之多了、這其間的離婚原因、却百分之九十多是起於婦人們的（這山又見那山高的心理、人盡可夫、可以說已是今日美國婦女們的一般風尙了一在紐約地方有一句很流行的諺語、即ｙｏｕｒＭｏｎｅｙｔｈａｔｗｉｌｌｏｐｅｎａｌｌｄｏｏｒｓｔｏｙｏｕ這句謬語的意思、就是說只要你有金錢任何事都辦得到、美國的婦女們、似乎看它是一句金科玉律的格言、一個妖媚綺麗的少艾、密願做兩　皤皤者的終身伴侣、這不知是什麽理由、但可以說只是拜金主義的驅使哩、</p>
<p>美國都市間的婦女、無論是已有丈夫的或是没有和男子結婚的、她們唯一的工作、就是在社交上努力、如果給我們貴國腦筋陳舊一點或富於保守的人眼光中者起來、一定要冷潮熱諷的批評她們是淫妓蕩娃、然而在美國人看起來、並不感覺着有怎麽的難過、不過、美國都市間的婦女們底社交的技能、實在是我們貴國婦女們所不及她們的、第一椿、就是跳無的技能、她們的每天生活的途程中、好像必須把跳舞加入並且當做極不可缺的功課、尤其好像一天不去跳舞、就感覺着一天中緊要的業務没有完了、就現在的美國婦女們的心理上看起來、已視跳舞爲最甜密不過的一種生活了、在通常的時候、或者還等着她的丈夫公餘一同到跳舞塲裏去、可是有些時候、却和别個男子一同跳舞、甚而拒絕她的丈夫的加入、第二椿、就是會吃糖菓、在我們中國佈道很久的馬丁博士、有一次曾經告訴我一件美國婦女好吃糖菓的故事、他說、離希治不到三十里的一個小鎭上、有一家人家、丈夫在希治的車廠裏做修理匠、他的家主婦向喬治多拿錢塊錢去、原想替他兒子繳學費、她却在喬治買了許多糖菓、一路向吃回去、等到她的丈夫回家時、問起繳學費那一回事、她瞠目矯舌莫能對、結果、就演出離婚的不幸、這種事在美國、我們可以敢說是有的、更據從美國游歷回來的人說、美國人婦女們、無論是在看戲玩要的時候或在郊外散步和閒居的時候、糖菓是常不離口的、尤其在社交的機會中、不肯離此君、表示她們是喜歡過</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<p>甜密的生活、並表示她們有甜密的愛情美國都市間的婦女們好時髦、並不在巴黎婦女們之下嗎、從前巴黎有一種笑談、說一個女子要她的丈夫買一頂最時髦的帽子、她的丈夫到市塲上揀來揀去、揀了一頂、就三步當做兩步的連忙去獻殷懃、以求美人的歡心、詎知等他買到、她反說這種帽子已經不時髦了、因爲在那短短的時間中、她已看見比較這個還要時髦的帽子了、其實、現在美國都市間的婦女要時髦的心理、抑又甚之了、做丈夫的人、只得拜倒石榴裙下、不敢道一個不字、她要什麽便什麽、所以美國的優越階級底婦女們、單獨帽子一項總要準備着幾十項、甚至於一百多頂、關於這一點、徐正鏗君在它的留美採風錄裏說的可以證明</p>
<p>還有、美國都市間的婦女們、大槪都有一個金鋼鑽迷、她們視金鋼鑽爲無王光榮的妝飾品、美國婦女以金鋼鑽爲不可少之物、和英國婦女之嗜茶然、美婦女本來是崇尙金錢的、所以有些人說拿金鋼鑽可換得婦女的愛情、如同磁石之於鐵的功用是一樣的、美國都市間最時髦的女子、不但帽子上要鐵金鋼鑽、手飾上嵌金鋼鑽、連衣裙上甚而至於鞋子上、也要嵌上金鋼鑽、無怪美國自一九二○年以後、單獨金鋼鑽一次進口值、每年要有九千萬元左右之鉅、紐約高歲司以及芝加哥聖路易波斯頓那些繁華的都市上、俱有很多的專門發售金鋼鑽的店舖美國都市間的婦女競尙妖媚（Ｃｈａ）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Three Presidents Telegraph Yan Xishan Again <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Refuting Yan's Telegraph on Two Points</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, and Wang Chonghui telegraphed Yan Xishan again on the 24th, saying: "To Vice Commander Yan Baichuan of Taiyuan, greetings. We have read your telegraph. You interpret our earnest advice as agreement with your intentions, obscuring and concealing the truth to deceive the people. We now realize that the greatest affliction of the human heart lies in the absence of shame and the confusion of right and wrong. Reading the full text, we understand that you no longer intend to resign, but instead wish to bring rebellious individuals expelled from the party into the Senate, using those who cause chaos to quell it, granting voting rights to all reactionary elements such as the Communist Party and the Reorganization Faction, and allowing those who betray the party to build the party. Fearing that we might be too ignorant to understand, you repeatedly enlighten us with thousands of words. Such astonishing and outrageous proposals are absolutely not something we are willing to comment on. Moreover, you have already directly communicated the two telegrams to the Central Government, and the Central Government, upholding the late Premier's teachings and based on the party constitution, will naturally make its own judgment, without the need for private discussion. We have nothing more to say on this matter. However, we are mindful that your actions today, in terms of the party and the nation, are still a mixture of merit and demerit. If we were to listen to your words and lose the country, causing suffering to all, we would still feel uneasy. Therefore, we earnestly implore you to reconsider. Since the beginning of the Republic, your party membership has been interrupted. For fifteen or sixteen years, you have not heeded the Premier's instructions nor associated with comrades. If you can work hard for the party from now on and remain steadfast, you will surely be respected by the entire nation. Why should you be criticized by comrades? Since the publication of your telegram, comrades at home and abroad have been extremely indignant. Telegrams of inquiry have been pouring in like snowflakes. Except for those around you, no one does not support unification and serve the Central Government. Yet, you are deluded by those closest to you, limited by your own knowledge, unaware of the vastness of the world, considering yourself a hero of the age. As soon as your words are uttered, thousands point fingers. If you still do not reflect, your friendship will be exhausted. Even if we love you, how can we distance ourselves from the party and the country? Comprehensively reading your telegraph, one point is to have the commanders-in-chief of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Group Armies enter the Senate or the Executive Yuan to safeguard the party and the country. If you mean that they possess military force, and that their military force can surpass everything else, then such an organization of military governors is something that we fear will be difficult to agree with, except in a world of Zhang Xun and Ni Sichong. You once spoke of returning power to the people, but now you want to place the military above the government. You once spoke of the people solving national issues, but now you want to solve national issues with the military. You also once spoke of democratic centralization, but now you want to replace it with military authoritarianism. How can this be allowed? If you mean that the Senate and Executive Yuan are respected but without power, then it would be like the General's Mansion and nursing home, spending daily stipends to support useless officials. How can they safeguard the party and the country? In this contradiction, we vaguely understand your intention. Your words are not from the heart. Your purpose is to represent all traitors, overthrowing the trustworthy Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, whom the Central Government and the late Premier relied on. With Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek gone, the traitors will be happy, regardless of China's chaos and destruction, the disruption of unification, and the suffering of the people. Assuming that you can truly represent all traitors, creating a situation where everyone from the Communist Party to the Anfu Clique and the Chuoan Society can coexist peacefully, then our party, in addition to struggling and failing, and becoming exiles again, will deeply regret the frustration of the Three Principles of the People, and you will still be considered successful in feudal thought. However, these people have not forgotten their grudges, and their interests are different. The people they support, such as Puyi, Duan Qirui, Cao Kun, Chen Duxiu, and Chen Gongbo, are rising like a storm, each wanting to drive you out of the country and interrogate you. You will not even be able to seek a peaceful end like Li Yuanhong in Tianjin. What Senate or Executive Yuan can be left? This is one point that we cannot agree with. The party and the country are voted on and decided by all party members. This proves that although you are a member of the party, you have never read the Three Principles of the People orally taught by the Premier, the Outline of National Reconstruction written by him, and the party constitution formulated by the National Congress. There is a certain method, a certain procedure, and a certain period for training the party and realizing constitutional government. You want to violate the Outline of National Reconstruction at this time and confuse it into one. As for resolving party affairs, the current Central Government is elected by the National Congress in accordance with the party constitution. The Central Government, in accordance with the party constitution, handles party affairs in an orderly manner, without allowing chaos. What is the basis for the so-called general vote? What is your intention? We believe that you think that the Third Central Executive Committee has expelled reactionary elements from the party according to law, and you want to speak up for them. If so, you will have to invite Mao Zedong and Tan Pingshan from the bandit dens, and recruit Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi from Annam. Such actions will gather people who are mutually hostile to the Central Government, and dividing the local areas is not enough, you want to further divide the Central Government. This alone is already frightening. Moreover, the Central Government's term of office is clearly stipulated. There is only one Premier, and there are no lifelong committee members. If you want to melt the Communist Party and the Reorganization Faction into one furnace, and give the Central Government's powers as a gift, destroying the party constitution and privately granting them, then the future troubles are immeasurable. You can speak of courtesy and concession, but you despise discipline and regulations. You have enjoyed the benefits of intellectual arts, but you lack the basic qualities of a revolution, so you pretend to quell chaos but actually propose methods to prolong chaos. This is the second point that we cannot agree with. The above two points are our loyal advice based on your suggestions. In short, your fundamental error lies in speaking of the party without the Central Government, in speaking of the party without knowing the party, in considering all rebellious elements as the entire party, in immersing yourself in your own environment, forgetting the needs of national survival, and in rejecting the trends of the world with your limited knowledge. What is even worse is that you are happy to benefit by sacrificing others, driving others into fire and water while you do not take the lead. This is evidenced by the recent armed takeover of all Central Government agencies and the heavily armed security at the Dagukou port. Now, you are even ordering Feng Pengzhu's army to invade western Shandong, not hesitating to be the culprit of national chaos. For your sake, the only way is to quickly withdraw the Jin army from western Shandong, stop all ominous actions, to save the critical situation and maintain peace. Otherwise, merely showing off superficial arguments and covering the eyes and ears of the people, even if we earnestly advise you with blood and tears, what good will it do? The fate of the world depends on your decision. We hope you will deeply consider and thoroughly investigate this matter. Hu Hanmin, Tan Yankai, and Wang Chonghui respectfully bow."

<p>.</p>
<p>Italy and Austria Show Affection</p>
<p>A few days ago, it was reported that Austrian Chancellor Schober visited Italy and signed an arbitration treaty with Italian Premier Mussolini. This treaty is the first step in establishing an important commercial treaty. Recently, it was also reported that the Italian Premier announced a general amnesty for political prisoners in Tyrol who were previously detained for opposing Italy's assimilation policy. Italy and Austria are showing affection. This is their clear expression and a sign of changing circumstances in Central Europe.</p>
<p>After the European War, Austria-Hungary was divided into two independent countries. Its territory was also seized. The Slavic people in the north were placed into Czechoslovakia. The eastern territory was ceded to Romania. The southeastern territory was merged with Yugoslavia. The southern territory of Tyrol was ceded to Italy. Therefore, although Austria declared a new republic in 1918, its situation was actually very difficult. All the surrounding countries were powerful neighbors looking at it with covetous eyes. Its finances and economy were also poor. Most of its food and fuel relied on other countries. It was almost impossible to survive on its own. Therefore, it started from the diplomatic front. First, it proposed the Danube Federation, but it failed. Then, it proposed the merger of Germany and Austria, but it was also blocked by powerful countries and never realized. The Social Democratic Party has always occupied the most important position in the country's domestic political parties. Recently, a faction imitating Italy's Fascist Party has also gained momentum. The current leader of the Fascist Party, Schober, has seized power and is advocating abandoning grievances and repairing relations with Italy as a temporary method of survival. Internally, it can suppress the power of the Social Democratic Party. Externally, it can alleviate the coercion of the Little Entente. This is the reason why Schober went to Italy to build a relationship.</p>
<p>As for Italy, it did not hesitate to abandon its relationship with the Triple Alliance and resolutely joined the Entente to resist Germany and Austria. Why does it now want to form an alliance with Austria? There is also a reason for this. Italy has harbored aggressive ambitions for many years. The Mediterranean is the lifeline of Italy, and its rights must be fought for. However, there are conflicts of interest between France and Italy in the Mediterranean. Therefore, today, Italy is eagerly trying to compete with France for hegemony in the Mediterranean. On the one hand, Italy has always had the ambition to dominate the Balkans and Eastern Europe and has been at odds with Yugoslavia. France has long courted Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia, concluding treaties to form the Little Entente to contain Germany and Austria. Therefore, not only do Germany and Austria fear being surrounded by French power, but Italy also fears that its progress in Eastern Europe will be blocked by France. It has been plotting to resist this for a long time. Today, there is an opportunity to increase its own power. Therefore, it has suddenly changed its plans to form an alliance with Austria.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Italian-Austrian alliance is such that it can be regarded as the starting point for the shift in the situation in Central Europe in the ten years after the European War. However, today's world trend is not suitable for the tyranny of Fascist Parties. The combination of Italy and Austria is based on the power of two Fascist Parties, hoping to go against the trend. The result is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Second Domestic Important Telegrams</p>
<h3 id="e5">Commemorative Week at Training Headquarters <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>He Yingqin's Report</p>
<p>Nanjing, He Yingqin reported at the Commemorative Week of the Training Headquarters on the 24th, saying that since Yan issued the telegram, party comrades and compatriots across the country have unanimously questioned and criticized him, hoping that he would stop at the edge of the cliff and wake up, not be blinded by personal rights and selfish desires, and that Yan would openly oppose the people's hope for peace and unification, publicly opposing them, and creating his own grave. The Central Government, in addition to Chiang and the five presidents sending telegrams to persuade him, still maintained the principle of being kind to others, expressing tolerance and maintaining composure. The revolutionary Central Government has always possessed a great spirit of fearlessness and non-compromise, and continues to work hard to realize the policy of peaceful unification. If peaceful unification cannot be achieved, then the revolution has not yet succeeded. This is the responsibility of our party comrades and the revolutionary people of the country. Therefore, we are not afraid of all difficulties and sacrifices, and we must fight to the end against all reactionary feudal warlords who are obstacles to peaceful unification. Yan has always been known for his steadiness. This sudden urgency is probably due to being surrounded by politicians. It is truly regrettable. At a time when the whole country is looking forward to unification, if Yan does not wake up again, he will surely be hated by the people of the whole country and hasten his own demise. As for the remarks he has made, regarding the use of troops by our party to quell the chaos as military unification, this kind of remark is extremely wrong, because it fails to recognize that our party's military force is the military force of the people of the whole country, not the military force of one person, one faction, or one clique. Our party, in accordance with the Premier's last wishes, serves as a public servant and teacher for the 400 million people of the country who have rights but no ability. When faced with the rebellion of feudal warlords, in order to protect the interests of the people and implement our party's principles, we cannot but fulfill our responsibility to quell the chaos. Although quelling the chaos also requires military force, the scope of the use of military force can be said to be only in the implementation of legitimate self-defense, which is different from expansionism and warmongering."

<p>London Conference Likely to Fail</p>
<p>Due to Insufficient Preparation Tokyo Daily Express Article US Naval Advisor Returns Home Due to Illness French Naval Policy Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th, Dentsu Dispatch A special correspondent for the Daily Express wrote an article today titled "The London Disarmament Conference Effectively Breaks Down," stating that the London Disarmament Conference has effectively broken down and is scheduled to recess until 1935. British official representatives may deny this, but the fact remains. The reason for the failure is insufficient preparation. Representatives from Japan, the United States, France, and Italy were surprised to find no agenda when they arrived in London. The Italian representatives will not return, France is experiencing continued cabinet crises, and Japan is also growing weary. The five countries will subsequently blame each other for the reasons for the breakdown and seek to avoid responsibility.</p>

<p>Japanese Political Situation Trending Towards Stability Ten Major Policies to Be Implemented Smoothly</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th, Dentsu Dispatch The people have made their final and fair judgment. The Minseito Party has achieved a major victory with 273 seats, surpassing the Seiyukai Party's 174 seats by more than half, with 40 seats to spare. Therefore, the opposition party will likely file a motion of no confidence against the government at the next special session of parliament, citing interference in the election. However, the trend of public opinion is already irreversible, and the overall situation is unfavorable to the opposition party, so it is not an issue. From now on, the power will be in the hands of the Minseito Party, and the government can smoothly implement the ten major policies without hindrance. With regard to diplomatic relations with China, the Kijura diplomacy will be continued in the hope of improvement. In terms of finance, the £230 million British currency public bond conversion scheduled for June is destined to succeed under more favorable conditions than expected. Although the outflow of cash due to the lifting of the gold embargo is unavoidable, the domestic price decline can promote export trade, and the real economic recovery will not be far off. According to the observations of some politicians, the current cabinet's position in parliament seems to be as stable as Mount Tai due to the party's overwhelming victory, but how to manipulate the Privy Council and the military is worthy of attention. Seiyukai Executives Adopt Passive Attitude The Seiyukai Party is greatly disappointed by the disastrous defeat in this election. However, its young executives advocate for exposing the government's blatant interference to boost morale and actively attack the government authorities. In contrast, the top executives hold a passive view, saying that there are various reasons for this defeat, but attacking the government today may not resonate with the people. It is more important to study ways to revive the Seiyukai Party. First of all, they demand specific revisions to the government's election law, and at the same time, they resolutely reorganize the Seiyukai Party's executives to gain the people's understanding.

<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi Struts with Pride Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who obtained an absolute majority and is in high spirits, made a statement regarding the process and results of the general election, and the future direction: The general election has come to a successful conclusion, and the reason for requesting the dissolution of parliament has been completely resolved. It can be said that a heavy responsibility has been lifted. During the general election, the two major parties in the ruling and opposition parties presented their political views to the world to seek the judgment of the people. Looking at the results this time, I feel the power of public opinion and it is gratifying that the people's faith is gathered in our party. Although we have obtained an absolute majority, the current cabinet will never be arrogant because of this. We must always maintain a sincere attitude and a firm will to promote the development of constitutional government and national fortune. More specifically, the mission of the current cabinet is to implement the ten major policies announced after the formation of the cabinet. Regarding this matter, we plan to issue another statement in early next month. This election shows that the people recognize the opposition between the two major parties and are unwilling to elect neutral members who have an unclear attitude. This is a very gratifying phenomenon. In short, the reason why we can obtain an absolute majority is that the people's expectations are gathered in one party. Therefore, our party's responsibility is very heavy. In this sense, we should unite as a party, be more nervous, and strive to handle national affairs, so as not to fail the expectations of the people, so that we can be acquitted, and we also hope that the people will understand the government's firm intention and encourage the government.

It is also planned to hold another general meeting of members before the special session of parliament in mid-April, and at the same time hold a general meeting to decide on parliamentary strategies. Because there were some former members who had bad feelings with the party headquarters or local branches during this general election, the party executives decided on a policy to devote all their efforts to try to eliminate bad feelings, so as to unite each other and increase the party's strength.

<h3 id="e66">World Demand for Cash Exceeds Supply <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Elk Grove, California, United Press, 23rd The world's demand for cash is growing day by day, resulting in a situation where demand exceeds supply. Gold miners here plan to ask the government to buy all gold produced at a price of US$20 per ounce. They say that the government can cast raw silver worth 50 cents into a silver dollar worth one dollar, so the government will definitely have the ability to pay this high price of $20. Currently, although economists in New York and elsewhere cannot agree on the future trend of the world's gold and silver markets, miners at various mines are saying in unison that if the world's cash is allowed to gradually decrease, then the prices of all goods will inevitably plummet. This can be seen from the exhaustion of supply in South Africa and other states with gold mines.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Commemorative Week for the Central Committee and National Government <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: At 9 AM on the 24th, the Central Party Headquarters held the 48th Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week in the auditorium. Approximately 500-600 people attended, including members of the Central Committee, officials from various departments and commissions, and guests. Chairman Hu Hanmin gave a report after the ceremony, stating that during the last memorial week, Committee Member Wu Zhihui reported that Yan Xishan's recent proposals were meaningless and would not gain the sympathy of the people. He expected the situation to calm down within a week. However, based on his observation, whether this would happen depended on Yan's ability to come to his senses. Yan's actions were a double-edged sword, due to his weak understanding of the party's and government's systems and responsibilities. He was easily tempted by external forces and acted inconsistently. Despite repeated corrections from the Central Committee and rebukes from the public, he continued to defend himself with fragmented and incomprehensible reasons, revealing his premeditation. As a member of the Central Committee and the National Government, Yan should bear significant responsibility for the party and the country. However, shortly after arriving in Nanjing, he returned to his old feudal base, fortified his forces, and violated the demobilization plan approved at the conference. What was his intention? He smugly believed that his violation of party rule was a clever move, but public opinion largely saw it as a path to self-destruction. Yan was usually adept at reading the political climate and exploiting situations. He was like a revolving lantern warlord who could maintain his power through cunning regardless of the circumstances, ultimately using and deceiving others to his advantage. However, his current situation had become a narrow pass. He had gained the support of the Northwest Army, the Anfu clique, the Reconstructionists, the Nationalists, and the imperialists who had always hoped for a divided China. He was no longer in control and was now bound by the conditions set by these factions, unable to hide his intentions. Any attempt to escape would lead to his downfall. Having always exploited others, he would likely be exploited this time. The Central Committee had only resorted to force against past rebels as a last resort. Whether peace could be achieved this time depended on Yan's ability to break free from his environment and abandon his feudal ideology. If he remained obstinate and destructive to the party and the country, the Central Committee would be unable to maintain peace, and he would likely disintegrate before the arrival of the punitive forces. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 AM after the report.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10 AM on the same day, the National Government held Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week. Attendees included Chiang Kai-shek, Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, He Yingqin, Zhu Peide, Chen Yi, Yi Peiji, Niu Yongjian, He Yaotsu, Chen Shaokuan, Wang Jun, Xia Douyin, Zhang Jingjiang, Shao Yuanchong, Yang Jie, Zhang Zhijiang, Zhang Nanxian, Wu Xingya, Wang Zhengting, Liu Jiwen, and officials above the level of section chiefs from various departments and commissions, as well as staff from the civil service and military affairs departments of the National Government, totaling over 300 people. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek presided. Secretary Qian Changzhao delivered the following political report: "The recent unrest in the country is due to Yan Xishan's absurd remarks. I have said before that the people are easily agitated, and those in positions of power should be especially cautious. Yan has always been known for his prudence, as proven by history. Since the founding of the Republic, there have been many political upheavals, such as Yuan Shikai's attempt to become emperor, Puyi's restoration, and the dictatorships of Feng Guozhang, Duan Qirui, and Cao Kun. Yan has always been steady and able to cope with various situations, maintaining his position and ensuring the safety of Shanxi. He deserves to be called a man who understands the times. Now that our military operations have ended and the Central Committee is focusing on improving governance, Yan has suddenly issued a series of telegrams, advocating for courtesy in running the country, convening the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, and establishing a Privy Council and Marshal's Office. These ideas are bewildering. Yet, he believes that his proposals are a practical way to save the party and the country. Yan's telegrams mention 'abandoning food' and 'losing sleep at night.' It is unimaginable that the practical solutions he has come up with after abandoning food and losing sleep are so irrational. There is no need to elaborate on their irrationality, as there have been many criticisms from various quarters. However, Yan's remarks have caused unrest and social turmoil, and his attempt to stop the chaos has only created more chaos. We find it strange that Yan, who was cautious when dealing with local affairs in Shanxi, is now so careless about the overall situation of the country. He was able to handle difficult circumstances well in the past, but now he cannot set aside his prejudices towards the Central Committee, which is determined to improve governance. Is it because Yan's position has risen recently, so his courage has grown? Or is it because Yan is too loyal and enthusiastic towards the Central Committee, so he expresses himself arbitrarily without distinguishing right from wrong? Only Yan himself knows the answer. The Central Committee has always pursued a policy of peaceful unification. When rebellions occurred last year, from the Guangxi clique to Tang Shengzhi, we always tried to stop the unrest and adopt a lenient approach. Only when it became impossible to stop did we resort to suppression. In short, we only use force as a last resort, and we use it for the safety of the party and the country, not for personal gain. However, Yan's telegrams mention 'holding the flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun together, being party soldiers together, and fighting each other, with the casualties being our armed comrades.' How can he not distinguish between obedience and rebellion? And the claim that force is used for personal gain is a deliberate slander. Even though he has made repeated mistakes, the Central Committee will sincerely correct him. Although we have received reports that Yan is preparing for war, the Central Committee will still appeal to him with righteousness, hoping that he will pull back from the brink. In reality, Yan has two smooth paths to take: first, withdraw his resignation and serve the party and the country wholeheartedly, implementing demobilization; second, sincerely retire and go abroad to clarify his intentions. A true man should act with integrity. If he is anxious about gains and losses and uses retreat as a way to advance, he will lose his revolutionary character. If Yan can thoroughly realize this, it is not too late. But if he chooses to take risks, it will be detrimental to the party and the country, as well as to himself. The above is regarding Yan. As for the future of the revolution, I also have some suggestions. We are not afraid of the invasion of imperialists, the existence of feudal ideology, or the machinations of frustrated politicians and warlords. The most dangerous and painful thing is the disintegration of the revolutionary forces themselves. Since the Northern Expedition, some revolutionaries have deteriorated, some have become corrupt, and some have lost sight of the big picture and engaged in destructive work in opposition simply because they disagree with the authorities. The revolution cannot succeed because of this, and the reactionaries are able to become rampant because of this. In short, the more the revolutionary forces disintegrate, the more the reactionaries dance with joy and have opportunities to sow discord. The reason why the revolution has not completely failed today is that there is still a group of forces fighting tirelessly, regardless of sacrifice. This fighting force is where the lifeline of the party and the country lies and should be cherished. At the same time, we hope that those who have a considerable history with the revolution should immediately turn back and work for the party and the country, even if they have taken the wrong path. Then, the bad environment will be easily broken, and the revolution will be easily successful."</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Ministry of Interior Plans a Draft Marriage Law <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the Executive Yuan and forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review</p>
<p>Yang Zhaotai, the Minister of the Interior, previously ordered the Committee on Rituals, Systems, and Attire to expedite the finalization of the four rites (marriage, mourning, sacrifice, and audience) plan so that it could be submitted to the Central Government for promulgation and implementation. Upon receiving the order, the committee immediately proceeded and first drafted the marriage and mourning rites. After review and approval by Minister Yang, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan yesterday to be forwarded to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval. The draft consists of twelve sections for marriage rites and eighteen sections for mourning rites. It is said that it was mainly drafted by Committee Member Yin Guangxun. The full text is quite lengthy because each section is accompanied by explanations. Given the great importance of this matter to public customs and culture, the original text of each section of the marriage rites is listed below, with the explanations omitted to save space.</p>
<p>Section 1: Engagement. Marriage should only be considered when the man and woman reach adulthood. First, an intermediary should inquire about the consent of both the man and woman. The parents or a relative within the fourth degree of kinship should be in charge.</p>

The woman's representative should welcome them in, and the guest should present the written document and gifts. The representative bows, and the representative accepts the document with a bow. The guest asks to await their response, and the representative takes the document inside and prepares a reply in the style of the original. The reply is presented with a bow, and the guest receives the document with two bows. The guest is then treated with regular courtesy. The guest departs, and the representative sees them off at the gate with a bow. The guest returns to report to the man's representative. If this is done in a public place, the exchange of documents and gifts is the same, and the guest is treated with courtesy.</p>
<p>Section 3: Setting the Date. When a date for the marriage is set, the man's representative should send a letter to the woman's representative stating: "So-and-so respectfully accepts your gracious favor and has chosen a propitious day in the coming month to hold the wedding ceremony. We respectfully request your consent." The woman's representative should reply: "We acknowledge the auspicious date and respectfully agree."

<h3 id="e71">Jiangsu Province Implements the Abolition of the Baojia System <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs issues an order to all counties to comply</p>
<p>Miao Bin, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs of Jiangsu Province, believing that the Baojia system harassed the people and hindered political training, specially requested the provincial government to abolish it and transfer the duties of the Baojia to the township and town offices. This was approved by the provincial government. The text of the Department's report to the provincial government and the order to the county magistrates are recorded below.</p>
<p>Report to the Provincial Government: This office investigated and found that on October 5 of last year, Decree No. 6084 from the Provincial Government stated that the County Magistrate of Rugao reported that the Baojia system harassed the people and hindered political training, listing the harms and proposing to abolish it by issuing a general order. The Government ordered that the matter be verified and a response be awaited. Upon receiving this order, it was determined that the local conditions in each county might differ, and it was necessary to determine whether there would be any practical obstacles to issuing a general order to abolish the Baojia system at this time. A report was first submitted to the Provincial Government, and orders were issued to the county magistrates to investigate and report. Now, the counties have successively submitted their reports to the Department, and their reports can be divided into six categories: (1) Those that have already abolished the system, including Jiangyin, Fengxian, Lianshui, and Jiading; (2) Those that advocate for abolition and believe there are no obstacles, such as Rugao, Nantong, Pixian, and Suqian; (3) Those that advocate for abolition after local self-government work has been completed, which can be further divided into two subcategories: (a) Abolition after township and town organizations are established and the duties of the Baojia are assigned to someone, such as Chuansha, Jinshan, Qidong, Yangzhou, Jiangdu, Changshu, Yizheng, Songjiang, Donghai, Baoshan, Nanhui, and Jurong, totaling thirteen counties; (b) Abolition after the Lilin organizations are established, such as Taixing and Xinghua, totaling two counties; (4) Those that advocate for gradual abolition, such as Wuxian, Danyang, and Siyang, totaling three counties; (5) Those that advocate for transforming the Baojia into clerks of the township and town offices or township police, district detectives, or Lilin chiefs, such as Gaoyou, Yancheng, Chongming, Haimen, Funing, and Gan'yu, totaling six counties; (6) Those that advocate for postponing the abolition, such as Zhenjiang, Shanghai, Jintan, Taicang, and Wujiang, totaling five counties. To summarize the opinions of the counties, it can be considered that a majority favor the abolition of the Baojia system. Although Zhenjiang and the other four counties advocate for postponing the abolition, their reason is that they are concerned that the original duties of the Baojia will not be assumed by anyone if the Baojia are suddenly abolished. However, since counties such as Jiangyin have already abolished the system without any obstacles, and the townships and towns in each county have now been organized, the original duties of the Baojia will not be a problem after the abolition. This Department proposes to transfer the duties of the Baojia to the township and town offices and issue a general order to abolish this harmful system as soon as possible to avoid harassing the people and hindering political training. Are the reasons for the prompt abolition of the Baojia system and the transfer of the original duties of the Baojia to the township and town offices appropriate? A clear report is being prepared, excerpting the views of each county and compiling them into a folded report, which is being submitted to you for your examination.</p>
<p>Order to the County Magistrates: Order No. 740 of the Provincial Government stated that, regarding the Department's report on whether to abolish the Baojia system, a folded report containing the opinions of each county was prepared, proposing to transfer the original duties of the Baojia to the township and town offices and issue a general order to abolish this harmful system as soon as possible to avoid harassing the people and hindering political training. The 263rd meeting of the committee resolved to handle it as proposed, and the Department of Civil Affairs was ordered to comply. In addition to issuing separate orders, the original report is hereby copied and issued to you, the County Magistrate, for your compliance and reporting without delay.</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Reorganization Plan of the Northeast Fleet <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Shen Honglie, the Commander of the Northeast Navy, has recently proposed the following reorganization plan due to the loss of three ships (Jiangzhen, Jiangli, etc.) in the Second Fleet during the war against Russia last year, as well as significant losses in the Marine Corps: (1) Repair damaged and old ships. The Jiangzhen and Jiangli, etc., have sunk and not yet been salvaged. Shen plans to salvage and repair them after the river thaws. All the unrepaired ships in the First and Second Fleets will also be repaired. It is reported that Shen has requested 400,000 yuan from the Commander of the Northeast Border Defense for these expenses. (2) Reorganize the Marine Corps. Shen believes that the Marine Corps needs to be reorganized urgently. He has decided to reorganize the existing teams into five independent battalions to achieve uniformity. (3) Train officers and sailors of each team. The officers and sailors of each warship and the Marine Corps have been patrolling and defending for many years and have not been trained for a long time. Shen plans to transfer the soldiers of each fleet to Qingdao and Liaoning in batches for training. It is reported that Shen will come to Qingdao at the end of February to reorganize the First Fleet after making some arrangements in Liaoning. (February 22)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese Establish Police Stations in Qingdao Without Authorization <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Qingdao City Party Committee requests the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest</p>
<p>When Qingdao was recovered in 1922, the Japanese established a police station inside their consulate and set up posts at various locations for patrols. At that time, Xiong Bingqi, the Director-General of Jiaozhou, negotiated with the Japanese consul many times, ordering them to stop, but to no effect. For the past seven years, the Japanese police have been arresting people without authorization and acting recklessly. The authorities have turned a blind eye. Earlier this month, a Chinese man named Liu Jiwen, who worked as a servant in a Japanese household, was arrested by the Japanese police on suspicion of theft and subjected to torture. The Second District Party Committee has requested the City Party Committee to send a letter to the Municipal Government to protest to the Japanese consul and forward it to the Central Government, instructing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate seriously with the Japanese ambassador to cancel the unauthorized establishment of police stations by the Japanese. The City Party Committee has already done so. The text of its report to the Central Government is as follows: (According to the report from the Executive Committee of the Second District Association, the case of the Japanese police arbitrarily arresting our citizen Liu Jiwen is a violation of our national rights and an insult to our national dignity. At a time when the Central Government is implementing the abolition of consular jurisdiction, this abnormal event has occurred in this city, which is especially hateful. Please forward a letter to the Municipal Government, strongly protesting to the Japanese consul, stating that Liu Jiwen should be handled by our courts and that the Japanese consul should be notified that they are not allowed to establish illegal Japanese police stations in this city. Please expedite the forwarding of a letter to the Municipal Government, making a reasoned case to the Japanese consul to uphold the Central Government's authority and protect the safety of the citizens. Based on this, it has been found that since the withdrawal of the Japanese army from Qingdao, Japanese police have been patrolling with weapons in the main streets of the city and in the Cangku and Sifang areas. A letter has been sent to the Municipal Government to protest to the Japanese consul. At a time when the abolition of consular jurisdiction is being vigorously promoted, the Japanese police are still recklessly arresting Chinese citizens. This is intolerable. Where is national sovereignty? Based on the aforementioned situation, in addition to sending a letter to the Municipal Government to promptly investigate and negotiate the Liu Jiwen case, the unauthorized establishment of police stations by the Japanese in Qingdao and the encroachment on national rights are reported to you for your review and forwarding to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for a serious protest in order to maintain national rights. This is for the convenience of the Party. (February 20)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Japanese Police Arrest People in Xiamen Again <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Siming Steering Committee requests serious negotiations</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Japan, based on the Twenty-One Demands, established a police station in Wutongcheng, Xiamen, in 1916. After repeated negotiations by the government, it was nominally abolished, but in fact, only the police station sign was removed. The plainclothes police remained as before. In 1928, the arrest of a Korean youth, Li Guihuan, caused fierce resistance from the people of Xiamen and became an international negotiation. As a result, the Japanese consul agreed to abolish the Wutongcheng police station. It was not until the winter of last year that it was moved to the Taiwan Public Association in Wuzhiding. In reality, it was not abolished. On the 14th of this month, Nakajima, the chief of the Japanese police station, led five or six Japanese policemen to search the Southeast Restaurant, which is owned by Taiwanese people of Japanese nationality, on Siming North Road. The First District Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, upon hearing the report, sent officer Wu Youkang with the police to investigate. When they arrived, the Japanese police had already left. Unexpectedly, Nakajima returned to search the residence of Li Longxi, a shareholder of the restaurant, and arrested Li, taking him to the Taiwan Public Association police station. At 4 PM, Li was sent to the Japanese Consulate on Gulangyu. After this incident occurred, the Siming County Steering Committee immediately sent letters to the Zhangzhou-Xiamen Naval Police Headquarters and the County Government, requesting serious negotiations. The original letter is as follows: (Regarding the report that the Japanese police in Xiamen arbitrarily sent several detectives to the Southeast Restaurant on Siming North Road at 2 PM on the 14th of this month to arrest Taiwanese Li Longxi, who was taken to the police station for interrogation and sent to the Japanese Consulate on Gulangyu at 4 PM for punishment, Xiamen is entirely our country's territory. On March 2, 1927, the police arbitrarily arrested Korean Li Guihuan, which became the March 2nd case negotiation. The pain of that incident remains. At that time, the Japanese consul declared that the police had voluntarily disbanded and that the same behavior would not occur again. Now, without notifying our government officials, they deliberately arrest people in our territory in broad daylight and send them to Gulangyu. Their contempt for our sovereignty and insult to our national dignity are even more obvious than in the March 2nd case and are utterly infuriating. In addition to sending separate letters, we are sending this letter to your Commander and County Magistrate, requesting that you investigate and negotiate seriously to protect our sovereignty and maintain our national dignity. We also hope to receive a reply, for the sake of party friendship.</p>

<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Fu Zaihui bandits, who have the nature of the Boxers, have fled into the Shanchong area of Tong'an County after being pursued and suppressed by Zhang Zhen's First Division. They gathered four or five hundred people, led by the bandit leader Wu Ci, and occupied the important town of Guankou, which lies between Tong'an and Zhangzhou, on the morning of the 17th, raising the banner of [General Wu of Jiangnan of the Great Ming]. The town only had some local militia and a dozen policemen from the county's Public Security Bureau branch. Although they resisted slightly, they were no match for the enemy due to their small numbers. Four members of the militia and three policemen from the Public Security Bureau were killed on the spot. After entering the town, the bandits extorted 20,000 yuan from the merchants and demanded that it be paid by the evening of the 18th, or the entire town would be burned down. On the evening of the 17th, they collected over 1,000 yuan. On the 18th, Wu led more than 80 of his followers to Jiaowei to surround and confiscate the militia's firearms. On the way back, they were ambushed at the Hongdai Bridge by Yan's regiment of the 167th Brigade of the 56th Division, which was heading to Quanzhou from Zhangzhou. Five or six bandits were killed. After Wu Ci's defeat, he returned to Guankou and feared that the 56th Division would pursue them, so they abandoned Guankou that night and retreated to the Daling Mountains. On the 19th, Yan's regiment entered Guankou, and Wu fled to Lindun. When the Fu bandits occupied Guankou, the residents fled to Xiamen. According to the refugees, in addition to the [General Wu of Jiangnan of the Great Ming] banner, the bandits also had banners such as [Nine Heavens Profound Lady] and [Xuantian Emperor]. Their internal organization is similar to that of the Sanhehui bandits. Most of them are from Longyan and Zhangzhou. They wear blue or black clothing and carry a bamboo amulet around their waists. The core bandits are mostly key figures in the Sanhehui. The group that occupied Guankou this time is the same group that recently fled to Changtai after being severely suppressed by the First Division in Zhangzhou. During their two-day occupation of Guankou, the bandits looted and extorted, causing losses of over 20,000 yuan. (February 21)</p>

<p>The Fugitive Bandit Leader is Escorted Back to Songjiang: The bandit Ji Lao Si and others, who were involved in the abduction of the young daughter of Jiao Shi Ru from Xinqiao Town in this county, escaped from prison in broad daylight last autumn during the handover of new and old prison staff. Subsequently, the county government offered a reward and ordered their arrest. Except for the bandit leader Ji Lao Si, the remaining criminals were apprehended successively and executed after approval. However, after Ji escaped, his bandit nature did not change, and he committed crimes in Nanhui, Shanghai, Pudong, and other places, hiding in the French Concession. The Detective Team of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau investigated and, in cooperation with the French Concession police, arrested the bandit and escorted him back to the city Public Security Bureau to await review. After hearing the news, the county government immediately prepared a document and dispatched Political Police Chief Dong Futang to Shanghai to transfer him. At 4 PM on the 24th, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau also sent detectives to assist in escorting him back to Songjiang.</p>
<p>The New Prison Warden Takes Office: The newly appointed Prison Warden Zhang Zonglie was transferred from the Changshu County Prison.

Now, Mr. Zhang has come to Songjiang with his family yesterday and, after meeting with County Magistrate Jin, went to the prison to take office.</p>
<p>Provincial Order to Prepare for the Construction of Additional Prison Buildings: The number of prisoners in the county prison is increasing daily, gradually leading to insufficient capacity. The Higher Court sent personnel to Songjiang last year to investigate. After reporting back to the province, they issued a provincial order to construct an additional 20 prison buildings, instructing the county to discuss and implement the project. However, the expenses are enormous, and the local public funds have already been budgeted, making it impossible to allocate funds. This matter was raised at the 46th county government meeting. The meeting decided to convene various organizations on March 1st to discuss fundraising methods in order to comply with the order.</p>

<p>The Zhang Brothers are Falsely Accused of Theft: The brothers Zhang Er and Zhang San, farmers from Fang 20, Daijiaqiao, Eighth District, had a verbal dispute with the thief Qi Amao last year, which led to a long-standing feud. Unexpectedly, Qi held a grudge and, after being arrested as a suspect in his uncle's robbery case, fabricated accusations at the Tinglin Public Security Bureau, implicating the Zhang brothers. The bureau, together with the water police, came to Fengxian last month and arrested the Zhang brothers, escorting them to the Songjiang County Government for investigation. After interrogation, it was found that the accusations were false. At the same time, the neighbors also appealed and strongly vouched for them. Therefore, Songjiang County has sent personnel to investigate, and they should be released soon.</p>

<p>Meeting to Widen Guanqian Street Main Road: Mayor Lu and Director Liu of the Public Works Bureau, in order to start widening Guanqian Street Road, specially convened commercial leaders and landlords of Guanqian at 2 PM yesterday in the abbot's room of the Xuanmiao Temple to discuss the widening of Guanqian Street main road.

The reconstruction of the stone road requires an expenditure of 24,527 yuan, while the budget for the 18th year is only 15,000 yuan. Therefore, opinions were specially sought. It was the consensus that the difference in funding was too great, and that construction would take two or three months, making it impossible for landlords to move temporarily, resulting in great losses. It was decided to appoint Shi Junqing, Wang Jiacang, and nine others to convene a road construction committee on March 1 to discuss long-term solutions. The Higher Court is actively progressing with the establishment of county courts in various counties. The Higher Court is establishing county courts in various locations.

The original house purchased for the court was borrowed by the county Public Security Bureau and they refused to move. Initially, it was planned to relocate the court to the City God Temple, but the repair procedures were not easy. Therefore, a letter has been sent to the provincial government to negotiate, requesting that the Wuxi Public Security Bureau be ordered to move so that the site can be determined and construction can begin. In addition, the Higher Court is scheduled to recruit guard police officers today (25th), with a quota of 30, for the temporary detention center for prisoners in Shizikou.

His father owns a foreign goods store in Shanghai and is quite wealthy. However, Jiang likes gambling and does not work. In the spring of last year, his father, because of his incorrigible behavior, once declared in the newspaper that he was disowning him as his son.

Later, he met a girl named Aizhu, who was at the prime of her youth and quite beautiful. At first sight, they hated that they had not met sooner. Whenever they had free time, the two of them went to the park and were extraordinarily intimate, wishing to make a lifelong commitment to each other. This matter was heard by the girl's family. After investigating, they found out that Jiang's behavior was improper and were unwilling to agree to the marriage. Therefore, they imprisoned their daughter and cut off their contact.

<p>Since Dean Cheng Zhenqi of the National Central University School of Commerce resigned, it was the beginning of the semester, and the affairs of the school and the curriculum could not be lacking for a day. Although President Zhang Junmou verbally agreed to Cheng's resignation, his reliance on Cheng was never diminished. Subsequently, the school affairs meeting of the School of Commerce decided to send a letter to President Zhang, requesting that Dean Cheng be given a few months' leave to allow him to fully consider the matter, and to hire someone to serve as acting dean, in order to express the method of retaining and fulfilling all matters. President Zhang considered the presentation to be extremely complete and has now approved the request, sending a letter to Cheng to inform him of this intention. However, due to the multitude of school affairs awaiting to be handled, Yang Yinpu, the former director of academic affairs and associate professor of the school, has been appointed as acting dean, and Yong Jiayuan, the director of the accounting department, has been appointed as director of academic affairs. Everything is proceeding as usual. Classes officially began on the 18th, and all new and old students have arrived. The number of courses offered this semester is much greater than in the past, and the spirit is even more fulfilling. From the 24th, the weekly memorial service and military training will be held, as well as how to plan the publication of the School of Commerce newspaper. The collection of manuscripts is nearing completion and will be published in the near future.</p>

<p>Philippine Athletes to Reside Next to the Venue at the Japan Youth Hall</p>
<p>(1) Preliminary Round of Track and Field Athletes</p>
<p>Regarding the selection of track and field representatives to attend the Far Eastern Games, the Japan Sports Association has scheduled the first preliminary round to be held around mid-April in various regions of the country (the Kanto region has already scheduled it for April 19th and 20th in Tokyo). Then, on May 17th and 18th, the National Track and Field Championships Preliminary Round will be held. Those with excellent competition results will represent Japan at the Games. After the decision, they will gather in Tokyo for training.</p>
<p>(2) National Swimming Competition to be Held</p>
<p>Regarding the swimming athletes attending the Games, in addition to designating a number of athletes with excellent past results, the Sports Association will hold a national competition at the Tokyo Shiba Park Swimming Pool on May 10th and 11th. From May 12th, the selected athletes will be summoned to live and train together in Tokyo. The association has also issued a notice prohibiting swimmers from various places who hope to be selected to attend the Games from going abroad to compete between February and June.</p>
<p>(3) Preparing for Women's Team Ball Open Tournament</p>
<p>Japan is paying great attention to the women's open team ball competition this time, dividing the country into four regions. Each region will first hold separate competitions to select a team, and then hold a joint competition before the Games begin. The winner will represent Japan to compete against China and the Philippines. According to Japan, women are well-trained in team ball, and it is a performance item in the National Games. In the future, the national representatives will definitely be a strong team. It is hoped that female students in our country will pay more attention.</p>
<p>(4) Accommodation for Philippine Athletes Determined</p>
<p>According to a report from the Japan Sports Association, the association has received a letter from the Philippine Sports Association, notifying them that the Philippines will send a total of 140 athletes to attend the Games, and entrusted the association to find accommodation in Tokyo. Considering the large number of representatives at this Games and the difficulty of accommodation, the Japan Association has organized an accommodation preparation committee. According to a report by Committee Chairman Dr. Nozu at the last executive meeting of the Sports Association, the association has not yet found a suitable place to accommodate representatives from various countries. The most difficult problem in accommodation is the supply of beds, because Japan, except for the largest hotels, hardly knows what a bed is. The association is currently working to rent the entire Japan Youth Hall near the Jingu Athletic Meet (the Games will be held there) for the Philippine athletes. The hall is well-equipped and close to the competition venue, making it ideal for athletes to stay. Unfortunately, it has already been obtained by the Philippines.</p>
<p>(5) Philippine High Jump Highest Record</p>
<p>Tokyo, 24th, Japanese News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to a telegram from Luzon, the Philippine Sports Association held a preliminary for the Far Eastern Games. Philippine athlete Toribio broke the highest record of six feet seven inches in the high jump.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Table Tennis Federation's 7th Bank of Communications Cup League Competition began on the evening of the 19th at the Jiande Hall. The contestants were the Commercial Press and Qinglian teams. At the beginning of the competition, there was an unusually crowded number of men and women spectators.

<p>Qinglian Wins Commercial Press 6 to 5</p>
<p>Yisi Wins Lingnan Sports Association 6 to 5</p>

<p>Overall, except for Jin Xing and Yisi, all the above teams are joining the league for the first time, but their skills are quite good and evenly matched. However, they are slightly less experienced, and their fighting spirit remains the same, so the results are very close. The schedule for each team this week is recorded below:</p>
<p>Location Referee</p>
<p>26th Jiande Fudan University Jiande Hall Ruan Yaohui</p>
<p>27th Lianglu Yisi Lianglu Tongrenhui Lu Xiulu</p>

<p>Hankou Special City Prepares to Participate</p>
<p>City Government Approves 1,000 Yuan in Funding</p>
<p>Sports Circles Will Request an Increase</p>
<p>The current Central China Games are scheduled to be held in Anqing on March 18th. Mayor Liu of Hankou Special City believes that Hankou is located in Central China, with a status equal to other provinces, and should send athletes to participate at that time to promote sports and promote the martial spirit of the citizens. At the 44th regular meeting of the Municipal Government, he proposed a motion to send personnel to attend the 4th Central China Games for public deliberation. It was decided to send athletes to participate independently, and stipulated that the expenses would be 1,000 yuan, which would be controlled by the Education Bureau. It is heard from people in sports circles that the city will adopt strict principles in sending athletes to participate. Before March 18th, a preliminary round will be held to produce participating athletes. However, the city government only allocated 1,000 yuan in funding, which seems insufficient. Fellow sports enthusiasts plan to prepare a detailed budget and submit it to the Education Bureau to be forwarded to the city government to slightly increase the funding. This matter has been discussed with the financial authorities privately. It is said that if the amount is not large, the request can be approved.</p>

Fortunately, Mr. Li embraced the spirit of perseverance and re-collected and rushed to produce it, which was finally completed this month. Our bookstore is deeply sorry for the burden on the expectations of all circles.

<h3 id="e120">A Record of Plum Blossom Appreciation at the Five Beauty Academy in Chashan <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Nong</p>
<p>I used to live in Yongjia for a long time. The mountains and rivers of Yongjia are beautiful and secluded, with lush bamboo and trees. Every year in winter, I would go to the Five Beauty Academy in Chashan with friends to see the plum blossoms. Years pass quickly, and it has been more than ten years in a flash. Last winter, there was heavy rain and snow in Shanghai. I stayed in bed with the door closed. I happened to receive a letter from a friend in Ouzhong, saying that there was heavy snow in Yongjia this year, and the cold plum blossoms in Chashan would bloom in a few days. He invited me to appreciate the plum blossoms. My heart stirred when I read it, and my interest was aroused. The next day, I took a steamer to Ou. At that time, the rain and snow in Ouzhong had just cleared, and the morning sun had just broken through. The remaining water on the eaves was still frozen. I went straight to my friend's house. The host was very happy when he heard that I had arrived, thinking that a distinguished guest from afar had come to appreciate the plum blossoms. Even visiting Dai An Dao on a snowy night was not an exaggeration. I chatted with my friend at his house for a day and a night. We were very happy. We agreed to go to the mountain the next morning. In the morning, the host had already prepared a flower boat and invited several old friends to accompany us. We took a boat from Oucheng, and the scenery along the way was beautiful. The weather was fine after the snow, and we enjoyed a lot of scenery. We made tea, ate fruit, and enjoyed ourselves around the stove in the boat. When we arrived at Chashan, we left the boat and went ashore. After not many steps, we arrived at Gushangtang. Plum blossoms were planted all around the pond. The houses were staggered, and the stream surrounded them. Living in it gave one the feeling of being a divine couple. At this time, the plum blossoms were even more beautiful after the snow. My friends and I walked and stopped, looking at them from afar, like snow piled up in front of Mount Guye. Looking at them up close, like thousands and thousands of pear trees blooming. The fragrance was so strong that it felt like entering a sea of fragrant snow. Some were strong trunks with beautiful sprouts, some were new roots sprouting branches, some were lying horizontally, some were leaning halfway.</p>
<p>They were charming and graceful, smiling in the wind. The roots were intertwined, and there was still some residual snow that had not melted. The host then set up a stove under the plum blossoms to cook tea and compose poems together to record the beauty of plum blossom appreciation. Before the plum blossom appreciation was over, a monk from the Five Beauty Academy came and invited us to visit the temple. The temple was close to the mountain</p>
<p>foot. The water and trees were clear and quiet. The meditation room was quiet. That night, there was another heavy snow. I</p>
<p>and the host had dinner at the temple. The mountain delicacies and wild vegetables were fresh and refreshing. The next morning, the temple gate had just opened, and the entire mountain had become a silver world.</p>
<p>We then rekindled our interest in visiting the plum blossoms, treading in the snow to find the plum blossoms, imitating the story of Meng Xiangyang. As soon as we arrived at Gu Zhai Tang, the plum blossoms in the snow were even more delicate and beautiful. The newly sprouted plum branches were bent by the snow, making them even more</p>
<p>charming. Calling it a sea of fragrant snow, who would say it was not appropriate?</p>
<p>We then each composed poems on the theme of the sea of fragrant snow and rhymed them in the plum blossom</p>
<p>forest. After enjoying it for two days, the host still couldn't bear to let us go. We urged the host to return. Along the way, snowflakes were still flying into the boat windows.</p>
<p>We only saw white herons standing on the snowy beach. Looking into the distance, the ancient trees were bare</p>
<p>forest, covered with snow. It seemed that every tree was a plum blossom. The friends in the boat entertained themselves with stringed instruments. I have always liked to play with lyrics and tunes, so I sang several tunes in Nantianmen loudly. My friends clapped their hands when they heard it. However, I also wrote about my own frustrated and bored feelings, without caring about whether it was good or bad. When the boat arrived at Oucheng, there were already lights in every house. I only stayed in Ou for two or three days to visit old friends and talk about my true feelings. Some invited me to visit Nan Yan. I wanted to return to Shanghai urgently because it was the end of the year. My friends were all disappointed. Now, I append three quatrains on plum blossom appreciation in Ou: A touch of pear cloud hides the buildings, as if entering a dream in Luofu. In an instant, it flies and dances with the wind, making it difficult to guess whether it is flowers or snow. The sea of fragrant snow on the mountain is like the real thing, no need to ride a donkey and step on the snow to find it. The secret fragrance passes through the nose everywhere, how many lifetimes of cultivation have it taken to accompany the flowers now? The wind sends the fragrance of flowers into the wine cup, and the beauty's smile comforts the longing. How can one bear the affectionate moon in the paper tent, and illuminate the farewell in the small boat?</p>
<h3 id="e121">Dreadful Meningitis <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>Since the opening of Shanghai to foreign trade, the world has become one family. The infusion of culture is rapid, and the discovery of new diseases is also numerous. Diseases such as neurasthenia and venereal diseases are called cultural diseases. The harm to patients is already great. Last spring's outbreak of meningitis, which killed people from dawn to dusk, was even more severe than the eight major statutory infectious diseases such as cholera and scarlet fever. Meningitis is also known as spasms. Its symptoms are headache, stiff neck, vomiting, limb spasms, and delirium. Most people die within three or four days. A recent newspaper reported that a man named Jia in Xinzhuang contracted the disease and died in the middle of the night after his wedding. The bride cried in despair. Cases have also been discovered in Baoshan, Zhenjiang, Songjiang, and other places. People are afraid of it. Prevention is urgently needed. In the past, plagues always occurred in the late autumn and summer. Therefore, there is a folk saying that one should escape in June. Now, epidemics occur in all four seasons. Shouldn't we pay attention to hygiene? In my humble opinion, this disease often occurs when the spring atmosphere is at its peak, which has some research value. The disease may not be entirely in the brain and spinal cord. Western medicine's water extraction surgery does not seem to be effective. When this disease was rampant last year, there were many Chinese and Western doctors who worked hard to study it. At that time, my cousin Li Jieqing returned to Ningbo from Shanghai and suddenly developed this disease. She died in less than three days. The tragic situation at that time is heartbreaking to think about. At that time, my cousin Cao Jun, who served in the capital's general headquarters, heard the news and returned home. He mourned loudly over the coffin. He had only been married for less than a year and had suddenly suffered the pain of losing his wife. It is truly a great tragedy in the world. Ningbo is a remote place, so there were no injections. Water extraction was only painful for the patients and had no effect. Jie Lu dares to shout loudly to the world: Hospitals in various places should know the plan to prepare in advance and quickly prepare meningitis injections. Don't dig a well when you are thirsty and repeat the mistakes of last spring. Individuals should take urgent preventive measures, isolate patients, and not go to crowded places. Inject immune serum, pay attention to food, water, and drinks. Close your mouth and breathe when going out. Use a mouth cover when the 丨丨 is at its peak丨丨Various disinfection methods should be implemented. The excrement, clothing, and utensils of patients should never be used. It is best to burn them. It is especially important to know that this disease can be treated with rhinoceros horn or antelope horn, which is often effective. (Because it is a heat syndrome, most patients are young people in their twenties.) Do not mix drugs indiscriminately. Western doctors still do not know of any absolute cure. My friend Yao Jun was saved after taking antelope horn. A famous doctor also advocated using this substance to treat it. Alas, the Buddha said that life is suffering, empty, impermanent, and selfless. He also said that birth, old age, sickness, and death are the four sufferings. Jie Lu is saddened by the fact that people in the world are not enlightened and saddened by the fact that the plague has not ended. I not only hope that all beings will attack the ultimate learning as soon as possible, but also hope to contribute a little insight to show to the people of the country.</p>

<p>— He Tianjian</p>
<p>Southern Winds inside the Palace. Long regrets continue. Where did the golden hairpin and jeweled box leave their pain? This is an eternal tragic story. Unexpectedly, after thousands of years, I was able to stroke the utensils used to wash off the rouge and powder. This cannot be said to be not my good fortune. Yesterday, I passed by Shou Tie's house. I wandered around the courtyard. I happened to see an object shaped like a stone drum, octagonal in shape, about seven inches high and six feet in circumference. The material was like blue stone, and it seemed to have carved patterns. When I approached to look at it, I found that the faces of the octagon were engraved with female images playing music. There was one image on each face, and there were a total of eight images when viewed in a cycle. The female images were all in palace attire. Two were blowing reed pipes. One was blowing a flute. One was blowing a horn. One was playing a zither. One was playing a lute. One was striking a clapper. One was holding a dance belt and squatting to dance. It resembled today's tango dance. Her breasts were half-exposed, and her attitude was charming. The shapes of the other images were sitting or standing, facing forward or sideways, all surrounded by pearls and jade, with graceful demeanor. The carving was a relief carved by the Japanese. The body was deep and the shape was cluttered. It could be grasped halfway. Shou Tie said that the material of this instrument was like blue stone, but it was not stone. It was actually aquamarine jade. It was obtained from a Chang'an person for 500 gold. Many archaeologists have proven that it was an instrument used by palace women during the Tianbao period. In the past, Yun Nantian obtained a fragrant cup, and the wind blowing through the curtains carried a faint fragrance from the cup. Therefore, he named his house after it. This instrument used to be washed and powdered by palace women, and there should be residual fragrance left. I don't know if Shou Tie has ever smelled it in his dreams on a clear night. However, the thorns and cold smoke have been buried for a long time, and it has been transferred to the world, and it has been many years. Even if there is any legacy, how can it be obtained now? After watching, I urged Shou Tie to move it indoors to avoid erosion. Although it does not have the fragrance of Yun Ou's cup, if it is connected to our country, will it be like the ancient people saw the dancing girl descending from the screen? We smiled at each other, and Shou Tie nodded. Looking at the knife marks, they were very clumsy, like the clay walls of the Baosheng Temple in Jiaozhi Town. There were good points in between, or even better. In my humble opinion, this instrument may not only be from the Tang Dynasty. Even the name of the instrument is not very suitable. Only the hole carved in the middle is very large. I thought of other things, but I couldn't figure it out for a while. I am an outsider to the study of bronzes and stones. I will record its shape for now. The work of textual research will be left to the learned gentlemen.</p>

<h3 id="e123">A Short Record of Iron Heel Red Dance <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Xiaoshan</p>
<p>When red terror permeated the Russian Empire, the whole country was in turmoil. The slave life of past dynasties and the inhumane oppression cultivated a semi-animalistic, dangerous, and crazy character. Once liberated, on the one hand, they were influenced by red thought, and their hearts were burning with the idea of revenge, making them easily become dangerous people. On the other hand, they were baptized by traditional ideas and possessed the simple nature of primitive times, making it easy for them to make great sacrifices. (The Red Dance of Iron Heel) (HE Red Dance) is a magnificent drama depicting a farm girl in our country's revolutionary era avenging her father and saving her lover. At the same time, it nakedly exposes the situation of the revolutionary era. It is pitiful that the common people brandish white blades and shed red blood, only to create merit for a few people. It is sad and lamentable. The poison of the Red Party and the extravagance of the aristocracy are presented to our audience without reservation. The heroine is Dorothy Del Rio, and the hero is Charles Farrell, both of whom are famous stars. It is heard that the film will be released at the Paris Grand Theater on the 26th of this month. My friend Yang Minshi has also published a special issue for it. The copper pictures and texts are dazzling and extremely impressive.</p>

<p>A correspondent in London reported in January that Dr. Ivan Loring, Professor of Electrical Engineering at the Royal College of Engineering in England, recently displayed all his newly invented electrical appliances in the college's testing laboratory for public viewing. Among them, the most amazing thing is a camera that uses brain thought as its action. The doctor's intention in inventing this machine is to facilitate future courts in studying criminals, saving the trouble of general evidence. All that is needed is to use this machine to photograph their past thoughts on the screen one by one, so that the perpetrators have no way to argue. The method uses a kind of current that passes through the palms of the perpetrator's hands. Both ends are inserted into the machine box. Opposite the machine box is a cloth curtain. Whenever the perpetrator has a thought, it can be collected by the machine box and mapped onto the cloth curtain, as clear as the palm of one's hand. According to the doctor, although this machine box has been completed, it is not yet perfect. After one or two years of intensive research, it can be put on the market. People say that after this machine is completed, it will be no less than an electric Holmes.</p>

<p>Chapter 9: Scholars Riot in a Game of Hide-and-Seek, a Charming Woman Bestows Her Affection Freely</p>
<p>Yi Qingxian Pavilion said, "My small portrait being published in the newspaper... this is the masters praising me... but I see some newspapers... publish the photos... looking like living ghosts... some are a blurry mess... you can't even clearly see the nose and eyes... originally that photo... was taken quite well... but they publish it like this... It's asking for bad luck... so I later didn't want them to publish it in the newspaper... I often told them... take the small portrait... don't publish it... " Shi Guanping said, "Don't worry... the reason they become a blurry mess... is because the copperplate isn't made well... the printing isn't refined... and the paper is bad... Our printing house here... the plate-making and printing are done by famous craftsmen... the paper uses 100-pound art paper... and the printed result will be as clear as a photograph... I guarantee you'll be satisfied..." Yi Qing said, "That would be great... I'll come to take the photo in a few days..." At that time, everyone praised the Eight Treasures Diagram... passing around and viewing her photograph... Everyone was talking about the two Si Baos... so that's how it became the Eight Treasures... Suddenly, Yan Yichen said, "Haven't you noticed... right now, the two people with the same name are here..." Everyone was brought up short by his mentioning it... so they looked around at everyone present... Yan Yichen pointed to a round-faced girl sitting across from him, with hair as lush as clouds... and a girl sitting beside him, as beautiful as peach blossoms... as cold as frost. Si said, "Aren't these two people also with the same name?" Everyone thought about it and it was true... originally the one sitting across from Yan Yichen was called Shi Yunlai... the one sitting beside him, although her name now is Chen Jiangyun... her former name was Jin Yunlai... this is just like Hu Si Bao and Hong Si Bao... two Si Baos with the same name... these, however, are two Yunlais with the same name... however, both Yunlais... are temporarily beauties... their appearance and temperament... are greatly different... That Shi Yunlai... is a very lively</p>
<p>young woman... She always smiles when she sees people... two shallow dimples appear on her cheeks... even when she's not speaking... she has to think of something to say... to appease you... so when she arrives at the stage... she feels like she's talking and laughing... whether she calls for one or two acts to be sung... she feels a sweet taste... in short, she belongs to the active type of woman... whenever there's something... she's always very happy to participate... And the young girl who is now renamed Chen Jiangyun, formerly called Jin Yunlai... is only fifteen years old this year... but she is tall and graceful... the same age as Hua Ruiyun... but half a head taller than Hua Ruiyun... When she gets on stage... she's not very willing to speak... when people ask her two questions... she only answers one question... she doesn't easily smile either... because people think she's like a modest and reserved young lady... they deliberately try to make her laugh... she sometimes can't help but smile slightly... because someone who doesn't smile much... when they do laugh, they have a special charm... and they also show two dimples... but overall it feels like she's sitting silently most of the time... in short, she is a woman who belongs to the quiet type.</p>

<p>More Goods, Stagnant Sales, Increased Short Selling, Softened Market Sentiment</p>
<p>The yarn market is still sluggish, the situation is quite weak, there are many rumors about the current situation, the current sales are not smooth, and the industry unanimously bearish. As soon as the market rises, there are many sellers, which is really because the bottom goods are too thick, and the pressure from the short side is increasing. However, the season is in the spring sales period, and general stable people are all standing by, but the attitude is still calm. It is heard that there are already five or six thousand bales of goods that have been delivered this month. The yarn market is in a situation of more goods and stagnant sales, and it is difficult to turn around without special needs.</p>
<p>Active Selling Sentiment in the Market, Market Continues to Fall: The front market of term yarn opened, the situation was very weak, and there were even more new sellers. The market atmosphere was soft, and each month fell by three, four, five, six, or seven qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual sales were active, and there was a part of hedging, slightly rebounding. There were also many vacant lots in this month, with near months rising by two or three qian and far months falling by four qian. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 14,600 bales. The closing price of the bidding is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Current Sales are Still Active, Selling Prices are Flat: The current yarn route is slightly active. Yesterday, each gang bought a total of 1,390 bales. 300 bales were entered among peers. The market was flat. The guest gang and the mainland gang had the best intake. It is estimated that 375 bales. In addition, Shantou Gang entered 350 bales.

<p>The cotton market is stable, but the foreign cotton situation is very soft. The local cotton business is very clear. Because the selling price of Indian cotton is cheaper, each factory has changed to buying Indian cotton, and the situation has a tendency to fall. The domestic source is rare. The Han gang is closing the spot goods and not letting them go, and is doing more in the standard market, buying in large quantities, but the standard goods of the same kind are indeed very lacking, so the market is tight. At present, the near month can still maintain for a while, and the far month may be hit after the foreign cotton flourishes.</p>
<p>The Recent Cotton Subsidy Only Rose by 2 Qian: The Han standard front market opened, and because Indian cotton fell again, people's hearts were plain, and the market was very tired. Each month fell by 2 Qian. Later, the Han gang bought in sharply, and each month rebounded by 5 Fen to 1 Qian and a half. In the afternoon, this month was the last day of delivery, and those who lacked the vacant lot were particularly prosperous, and the market was quite high, rising by 2 Qian. The far month was softer, falling another 5 Fen. The total transaction statistics for the whole day were 55,300 dan. The closing price of the Han standard is recorded on the left.</p>

<p>Mumbai: Last week, because US cotton fell slightly, the rising trend also lost momentum. Although there were transactions in Europe, China, and Japan, it was still not enough to maintain the market price. The cumulative collection count increased by 500,000 bales compared to the same period last year. Exporters and local manufacturers have purchased a large amount every day, but the supply is very thick. An appendix to the weekly statistics is as follows (unit: thousand bales)</p>

<p>Liverpool: Last week, the current demand was very smooth, and futures were depressed due to short-selling pressure. The industry is still firm, and the market price has a downward trend, but the public believes that it has reached a low peak and a large transaction will occur soon. The Egyptian cotton market situation is the same as Liverpool.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Grain River Below Rice Prices Decline Slightly <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei Yesterday, about twenty barges arrived, but sales were slow. Changbang japonica rice prices fell by two jiao again. Currently, high-quality goods on the market are only around nineteen yuan, with a continuing downward trend. No one is interested in the Bo Dao rice, and only a few barges have arrived, with prices falling by a jiao and a half. Buyers of Yang Du indica rice are focused on Saigon small rice, which is greatly affected, with prices down by one jiao. Although there is some retail demand for port indica rice, sales are also slowing down, with prices falling by nearly one chi, resulting in sluggish transactions. Various dealers are taking a wait-and-see approach, and overall trading volume is sluggish, with only about 2,500 shi transacted throughout the day.</p>
<p>South Shanghai Over twenty barges arrived from downriver, but sales were not good. Changxi japonica rice prices fell by a jiao and a half due to sluggish retail demand. Both high and secondary grades of Su Tong japonica rice need to be discounted by one or two jiao respectively, with few transactions. Dealers, seeing no profit in reselling, have to sell at the market price, so the market atmosphere has become weak. Sales of South Bang Bo Dao rice are slow, and retail sales in various stores are sluggish. Overall trading volume barely declined by one jiao, while Yang Du’s sharp interior benefited from brisk sales in the producing area but few arrivals. Due to the pressure from foreign rice, sales are sluggish, resulting in both arrivals and departures being slow, and prices declining by nearly one jiao. There are a few scattered transactions of Bai Yuan rice.</p>
<p>Price of Standard Flour Weak in the Morning, Stable in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was weak in the morning due to the decline in the quoted price of Canadian foreign wheat on Sunday by eight or nine jiao respectively. Therefore, the opening prices for each month were lower than the previous week’s closing prices. Later, the prices of each market continued to open and soften, with the lowest price for this month falling by one and a half fen. The remaining months mostly fell by about one fen. By the afternoon, the price of this month stabilized due to the nearing of delivery, while the prices of March, April, and May rose due to purchases by Tianjin and other dealers, rebounding by one fen from the lowest price in the morning. Observing the current situation, since the beginning of trading, the difference between the prices of February, March, and April, which are in the era of wheat depression, is very large. Since current sales are not very active, the backwardation should not continue to exist. Observing the recent trend, it is feared that it will show a near-flat and stable appearance in the future. As a result, the closing price of this month was down seven and a half li compared to the previous week, while the prices of March, April, and May were up two and a half li, and the price of June remained unchanged, while the price of July was down by one fen.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Reasons for the Decline in Wheat Prices <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Foreign wheat prices decline Unstable times</p>
<p>Sluggish flour sales Mills not operating</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of wheat prices was also unstable. Due to the delivery of this month, the mills had no intention of buying, and the dealers did not dare to buy back, so the overall conclusion of the day felt quite smooth. In March, due to the rising but declining price of foreign wheat, people's hearts were greatly softened, and the unstable situation made it impossible for flour sales to be shipped north, and the wheat market could not be shaken, which was expected. Therefore, the downward trend was even stronger. In June and July, the forces of both sides were balanced due to mutual needs, with little ups and downs. As a result, the closing price of this month fell by two fen compared with the previous week, three months fell by five fen, four months fell by one fen, six months were a small one fen, and July was a good one fen. Although the spot market for wheat reached more than 3,000 bags yesterday, the mills did not intend to buy due to the low price of flour sales, so they were all in the hands of the dealers, which was actually equivalent to not opening. High-grade goods have been shouted down to the spectrum of two fen, and the middle and second grades have not been opened. It is estimated that Gaoyou wheat is five taels, one qian and seven fen, Mingguang wheat is five taels, one qian and eight fen, Suqian wheat is five taels, one qian and eight fen, Qingjiangpu is five taels, one qian and eight fen, and Taizhou wheat is five taels, one qian and six fen.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Spot Small Rice Falls One Jiao <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was still no improvement in the price of foreign rice, and the sales in Zhejiang were sluggish. Only the local village was dealing, and there were still arrivals today and tomorrow, and people's hearts were soft. Small rice futures continued to fall by three or four fen, and the spot price of small rice fell by one jiao. The market in Saigon was scarce. Recently, traders who changed goods today and tomorrow opened 1,000 packages, priced at 14 yuan, seven jiao and three fen, and the market will be more stable than that of small rice. The spot price of small rice was 100,000 bags, and the price was only 13 yuan, three jiao and four jiao. 1,200 tons in March and April, priced at five taels, eight qian, eight jiao and nine fen. It is difficult to expect the foreign rice market to be good for the time being, because there are many orders for this year, and there are more than 100,000 arrivals in the past week, and two or three ships will arrive in port today and tomorrow, resulting in an oversupply.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Piece Goods Prices Fall More Than They Rise <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>

Yesterday, the trumpet boy had sold 6 taels and 7 qian and a half, the hunter 6 taels and 6 qian. More than 200 pieces were traded in this street, and the customer gangs added more from Haizhou and Bengbu. Since the Guangshan and other places have been searched once, the inventory is too weak, so the opening price is firm and high. The Yanghe next month's goods opened 6 taels and 7 qian, and the blue double fish 6 taels and 4 qian and a half. Coarse cloth continued to tend downstream, and the sales of nine-pound and eleven-pound cloth were very quiet, and the situation continued to decline. However, more than 50 pieces of thirteen-pound double horse Jiangxi Anqing were traded yesterday, and the price opened 5 taels, 9 qian and 7 fen and a half. The news of coarse twill was very silent, and the customer was completely immobile.</p>
<p>East and West Piece Goods Yesterday, the bleached cloth of the eastern goods fell by another two and a half fen, and the double president sold nine taels, one qian and seven fen and a half, and the magpie bridge meeting nine taels and two qian. Straight tribute flannel and straight tribute satin were even more unbearable to ask about. Only the Changban Bridge still sold two qian and seven fen, and the rest were loose. Because the flower cloth was filled with the goods of this factory, it fell by a small two and a half fen yesterday. Medium and dark colors have fallen to four taels, one qian and a half, and white land has four taels, one qian into the customs. However, the blue striped Seatin customer's sales are smooth every day, and it is a little bit hard and lovely. The American woman's various colors are opened at one qian and seven fen, and the Zijin Mountain is one qian, six qian and seven li and a half. More than 100 pieces were traded. Although the sales of Western goods such as plate silk and government silk were still active, the price opened by the red market has been falling step by step. Yesterday, the first-class government silk opened at four qian and seven fen and a half, and the fair eight formations at four qian. The striped plate silk still fell to about two qian, but the bald color was still lacking.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Director of the Two Railway Administrations <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Liu Weichi Takes Office Yesterday</p>
<p>Publishes Opinions on Reorganizing the Two Railways</p>
<p>Since the former Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administrations, Hu Jixian, was transferred to the ministry, the Ministry of Railways immediately appointed the Director of Business Affairs, Liu Weichi (Zi Weisheng), to succeed him in managing the affairs of the two railway administrations. Mr. Liu came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago, and took the oath of office at the railway administration at 10 am yesterday. The Ministry of Railways specially sent Vice Minister Li Zhaohuan to Shanghai to supervise the oath, and delivered a training speech. Director Liu has specific measures for reorganizing the two railways. He will also pay attention to internal management, rectify long-standing malpractices, save money in economic terms, and strive for progress in business terms, so as to achieve the fundamental purpose of increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. As for the two items of passenger and freight transportation, which are most related to the revenue of the railway administration, they will be gradually improved, so that passengers can get peace of mind on their travels, and the railway administration can get economic relief. The following is a verbatim record of Director Liu's reply when he took office, (Today, I was ordered by Minister Sun of the Ministry of Railways to concurrently manage the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways. I am very grateful to Vice Minister Li for supervising the oath and giving guidance, and to all the guests, comrades and colleagues for their presence. I can only adhere to the policy set by the ministry, and use people and administration, all based on business principles as the standard. All colleagues can rest assured to work, and I will never misuse a single person. I will now contribute one or two points that should be paid attention to as follows, (1) Improve the spirit of management. The Shanghai Railway was purely built with debt from the Sino-British Company and British engineers, while the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was built by Chinese capital and Chinese engineers. Later, due to the relationship of borrowing, it was also managed by the Sino-British Company. The two railways were completed in 1908. Its construction engineering and equipment are better than other railways, and the military impact is also lighter than other railways. Since the establishment of the Ministry of Railways, the restrictions imposed by creditors have been gradually lifted. Hu Sizhang and others have also reorganized it, and there has been progress. However, because the power of management was in the hands of foreigners before, the personnel in the bureau were limited by the environment, and developed a kind of withered and slack atmosphere. Everything followed the old ways and shirked responsibility, Mr. Liu Weichi's small shadow</p>
<p>unwilling to make any claims, lacking a spirit of courage, we must know that the revolutionary government is progressive, and since we are party members, under the leadership of the revolutionary government, this kind of bad psychology should not exist, and I hope that all colleagues will reflect on themselves, (2) Try to save expenses and increase business, the business of the two railways was very small at the beginning, and the losses were quite large. Up to now, the two railways still owe more than 61.4 million yuan. Although there has been a gradual improvement in recent years, the expenses have also increased accordingly. Last year, the proportion of train expenses Qfte Ratidg Ratio reached 62%. According to the report of foreign consultants, although the income is better than before after the capital moved south, it is not that the business has increased, but only the freight has increased. Therefore, in the future, we should save all kinds of expenditures according to economic methods, such as machine coal wages. Now the purchase of materials for the two railways has been completely handed over to the purchasing committee directly under the Ministry of Railways. The railway administration can be exempted from the responsibility of purchasing materials. What should be paid attention to now is the issue of increasing business. Passenger transportation accounts for 83% of the income of the two railways, and freight transportation is very small. In the past, due to the lack of vehicles and old locomotives, passengers were crowded and the train was delayed. Now, passenger cars and locomotives have been successively ordered. Once the new cars arrive, it is planned to change the first-class cars to second-class, the second-class cars to third-class cars, and the third-class cars to fourth-class cars. All of them are equipped with new locomotives, and passenger transportation can be solved. As for the reason for the shortage of freight transportation, it seems to be due to the lack of freight cars and the high freight rate. All goods are transported by waterway. In fact, the two railways usually do not pay much attention to freight transportation and do not try to attract it. This is a big mistake. Now the railway administration plans to set up a business section, specializing in promoting freight transportation along the road. At the same time, it will rush to build the floating bridge between Beijing and Pukou to facilitate the freight transportation between the north and the south, so as to develop. (3) Welcome the proper criticism from the public opinion circles. Our country lacks capital, and the railway industry is still in its infancy. The national railway is only more than 7,000 miles. It is very difficult to compare with the European and American railways. However, the railway is a social undertaking, and the quality of its management is closely related to the people. Moreover, the two railways are close to Beijing and Shanghai, and they are visible to all. The people's criticism is more demanding than other railways. I hope that all colleagues will work hard to live up to the expectations of the people. If the public opinion circles give proper guidance and help the railway administration in what it cannot reach, it is even more welcome. There are many other things that should be done, which cannot be detailed due to time constraints. I am willing to encourage my colleagues to work together.</p>

<p>National New Tax Rate Also to Be Announced</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese tariff issue has been discussed several times by the Japanese Acting Minister Chongguang Kui and Foreign Minister Wang, and the two sides have discussed all the issues and drafted a draft. On one side, the Japanese Acting Minister sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to ask for instructions, and on the other side, Foreign Minister Wang submitted it to the National Government for approval.

<p>Xie Shou Kang</p>
<p>Xie Shou Kang, the Dean of the Faculty of Liberal Arts of the Central University, has news of going to Europe. Yesterday evening, Mr. Xie came to Shanghai on official business. The reporter specially visited Shao's residence on Jing'an Temple Road. The following is a brief record of the conversation between Dean Xie and the reporter: (Question) Is it true that you will be appointed as the Minister to Belgium? (Answer) The government has appointed Mr. Fu Bingchang, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan, as the Minister to Belgium. However, because Mr. Fu has important tasks in the Legislative Yuan and cannot leave the country for a while, this year happens to be the year when Belgium holds the World Expo, so I was sent to act as the chargé d'affaires. If I go to Belgium, it is in the name of Chargé d'affaires. The statement in the newspaper that I will be appointed as the Minister to Belgium is not true. (Question) What is the nature of the Belgian World Expo? (Answer) Belgium succeeded in its independence revolution in 1830. This year is the 100th anniversary. In order to celebrate, the Belgian government held a great exhibition and invited all countries to participate. Its nature is universal. (Universal) The National Government specially appointed Mr. Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, as the general representative to participate in the conference. Mr. Chu has stayed in Europe for many years and knows the situation there very well. This time, he spared no effort to collect exhibits. The government sent him to the conference, which is a real pleasure. (Question) Which exhibits have been collected the most in China? (Answer) A large number of industrial and commercial products have been collected and shipped to Europe a month ago. Educational products are also very rich, which is the characteristic of the Chinese delegation. (Question) Has the date of your trip to Belgium been set?

<p>Electrically Requests Amendment of Stamp Tax Law</p>
<p>And Schedule a Meeting to Draft a Draft</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, Nanjing Ministry of Finance Jianjian, I have now approved the letter from the Jiangsu Zhou General Chamber of Commerce to investigate the case that our association had previously requested a reduction in the stamp tax penalties on November 26 last year, and I have also sent a letter to your association to continue to submit a speedy amendment on record. It has been a long time since I heard that the government has revised it, so that the stamp tax sub-bureaus have taken this opportunity to illegally inspect and pick bones in the eggs, as if they are afraid that the people will not violate the criminal law. It is found that Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax stipulates that fines should be handled in accordance with the circumstances. The sub-bureaus are greedy for more bonuses, and they turn to hate the penalties that are too light, and the merchants are already unbearable to be cut off. Our association has repeatedly requested that it is not to open the door for merchants to evade taxes. It is only that the various tax regulations enacted in our country and the stamp tax laws in all countries do not have such severe penalties. There is indeed a need for revision. The approval from the Ministry of Finance last year also allowed the discussion of the compilation of cases when the revision was made, which proves that the original penalties were indeed unsuitable. Therefore, I would like to send a letter to check and hope that you will continue to submit a proposal for revision, which is deeply grateful. The case was previously submitted to the Department of the Ministry of Finance, and the approval No. 9478 of November 8, 18 was received, and the case will be discussed when the stamp tax law is revised. However, it has been a long time since today, and the revision has not been issued, and the contractors have taken advantage of the heavy penalties to make profits and thoroughly searched, only for fear that the merchants will not be heavily fined, and the disturbance of the market to this point is really an unsystematic system. The association believes that the provisional regulations on stamp tax are mostly unsuitable, and since they are difficult to implement, the stamp tax law should be immediately formulated and promulgated and implemented in order to enrich the country and facilitate the merchants. I should earnestly request the Ministry to quickly schedule a meeting to convene the stamp tax officers and representatives of the associations to discuss and draft the stamp tax law and submit it to the hospital for transmission to the government and order it to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation and promulgation. I still hope to reply by telegram.

<h3 id="e149">Commercial Rectification Conference <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Please Protect Domestically Produced Wheat Flour</p>
<p>Abolish Tax Exemption for Imported Foreign Flour</p>
<p>In Order to Save Sovereignty and Maintain the Flour Industry</p>
<p>The Commercial Rectification Conference sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan of the National Government yesterday for the matter of protecting domestically produced wheat flour, Nanjing National Government Bank's Executive Yuan Jianjian, according to the letter from the Shanghai Machinery Flour Company this month, I have learned that the Qing Dynasty had previously signed a treaty with various countries, and imported foreign flour was for the purpose of providing food for overseas Chinese. Because the domestically produced wheat flour in our country at that time was not hygienic, it was allowed to be tax-free to help the overseas Chinese. It has been a long time since then. Taking the supply of food as an excuse, foreign flour has been imported in its original form, and it has become a major part of trade. The stockpiles in Tianjin alone are often as many as four or five million bags. Most of the imports from Dalian in the north are in fact from the vast majority. Even the special tax on wheat flour is not easy to collect. The sales of Chinese flour have almost been taken away by it, which is a loss of the original intention of the treaty at that time. Now that our country's machine-made wheat flour is of excellent quality, overseas Chinese food does not need foreign flour supply. When the customs are completely independent and the new tariff is promulgated, it is planned to ask the government to preside over the cancellation of the previous treaty. From the date of promulgation of the new tariff, all imported foreign flour will be taxed heavily with reference to the import tax rate of foreign flour in the United States and Japan, so that the import of foreign flour can be reduced and Chinese flour can be promoted as much as possible. The matter is related to national sovereignty and the rise and fall of the flour industry. In addition to submitting it separately to the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance and Industry, the Customs Department, the Central Political Conference, the People's Food Committee, and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, the relevant letter is hereby sent to your association for verification, and I implore you to submit it to the Executive Yuan and submit it to the Executive Conference for review and implementation. The association learned that the Qing Dynasty listed the daily necessities of foreigners as tax-free, which was ignorant of the situation and made a big mistake. Later, due to the Boxer Indemnity relationship, most of the tax-free items for foreigners were deleted, while foreign rice and wheat flour remained an exception. Although it was for the purpose of helping people's food, the pros and cons were still enough to weigh. However, at present, flour mills are standing in our country, and the output is abundant. The situation is different from that of the Qing Dynasty. Foreign wheat flour is already in a confrontational position with us. If we allow it to be imported tax-free and at a low price, it will indeed make Chinese flour unable to compete. Last year, the new system of seven-level tariffs was promulgated, and these tax-free items were still retained according to the old system and were not corrected. Judging from the national protection policy, it is a shortcoming. Moreover, in the past, Chinese and foreign wheat flour were exempt from customs duties uniformly. Although foreign merchants enjoyed preferential treatment, Chinese factories could still enjoy a uniform example and could barely compete. Now, Chinese factories have to pay a special tax on wheat flour, and foreign flour imported in large quantities from the north and the south has not been able to set up a place to collect additional taxes uniformly during the transit. Therefore, Chinese and foreign wheat flour already have an unbalanced situation. If there is no place to remedy the situation by uniformly collecting customs duties, it is difficult for Chinese factories to support themselves and it is difficult to survive. According to the letter, the letter should be sent to the bank to check and approve the request of the association to cancel the tax-free system for imported foreign wheat flour and determine the import tax rate with reference to the current tax system of various countries in order to save sovereignty and maintain the flour industry. Customs autonomy and most countries have already concluded an agreement, then the listing of tax-free items into taxable items is naturally the effect of the national autonomous power, and there seems to be no need to go through negotiation procedures. I implore you to approve the implementation, which is for public convenience. The Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce Group Consolidation Committee Kouchang.</p>

<p>But Entertainment Luxury Goods Are Excluded</p>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Goods Factory Federation had previously requested the authorities to exempt it from the tax on domestic goods advertisements, which hindered the promotion of domestic goods. Yesterday, the Executive Yuan replied, The presentation is hereby approved. I have learned that the National People's Association for the Abolition of Unequal Treaties had previously instructed the Ministry to exempt the tax on domestic goods advertisements. The Central Government has approved and transferred it to the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Finance for review and reply. It is planned to levy an advertising donation on entertainment and luxury goods, but silk is not regarded as a luxury good. The remaining legitimate domestic goods advertising tax will be exempted. It has been decided by the Central Political Conference to follow the order of the National Government to order the provincial and municipal governments to comply. Later, the Zhejiang Provincial Government submitted a request to reduce the advertising donation of domestic goods by half, and attached the rules for the collection of advertising donations in various counties for review and record. The hospital has also instructed to follow the decision of the Central Political Conference to handle each case. You should know this notice, President Tan Yantuan,</p>

<p>The silk factory industry in this port was suspended one after another last year because the silk market in foreign villages was sluggish, the dry cocoon raw materials were scarce, and the adjustment was insufficient. Now that the sales of silk in European and American factories have turned smooth, and the price of silk has risen by more than 100 taels, the silk factories have been searching for dry cocoons and have started work one after another. Among the 104 silk factories in Shanghai, 70 have started working as of yesterday, accounting for 70% of the total number.</p>

<p>The Flourishing of Foreign Steamship Business: In the past ten days, the Yangtze River foreign steamships of the three companies, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Nissin Kisen, have seen an extraordinary flourishing of their import and export business. Butterfield &amp; Swire's Yangtze River ships, including the upper Yangtze River steamers, have increased to eight or nine sailings per week. Nissin Kisen has also increased to nine sailings. Jardine Matheson can operate six sailings. In addition, ships like the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company’s "Xiangtai" and "Jiejiang" are also fiercely competing to transport passengers and cargo upstream. Since the 21st of this month, the outbound cargo of various foreign steamships on the Yangtze River has become even more congested. Almost every ship leaving is fully loaded. Cargo arriving later has to be refused clearance. Each sailing's freight revenue exceeds one thousand taels of silver, and each company is overjoyed.</p>
<p>Upstream Navigation Blocked Again: This year, navigation on the upper Yangtze River began about a month earlier than in previous years. A decade ago, the water level in areas like Yichang, Shashi, and Changsha had already risen above nine feet. But within the past week, drafts of thirteen feet were recorded. Therefore, the Sichuan and Hunan merchants wired Shanghai in succession to request goods. British and Japanese shipping merchants have also dispatched ships such as "Wanliu," "Wantong," "Pinghe," "Jiahe," and "Wuling" to transport goods. Yesterday, the companies received telegrams from Hankou stating that the upper Yangtze River water level had suddenly dropped sharply starting from the 20th. Ships sailing from Shanghai to Yichang, Shashi, and the Xiang River were all blocked in Hankou and unable to proceed. Yesterday, the various shipping companies in Shanghai wired their Hankou branches to quickly dispatch small steamers to transship the blocked cargo, to avoid hindering commercial transport.</p>
<p>Record of Yangtze Steamer Collision and Sinking: The Sanbei Company received a telegram from Nanjing stating that the Yangtze River ship "Changan," traveling from Hankou to Nanjing, damaged the naval pier and pontoon boats when docking in Nanjing. The company has already acknowledged the responsibility for repairs. Yesterday, several artisans were hired from Shanghai, bringing materials, to travel by train to Nanjing to carry out the repairs. In addition, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Jiangda" steamer suffered damage to a large quantity of goods. The captain, Feng Jun, submitted a damage list requesting the company to forward it to headquarters. Chairman Chiang has already approved and instructed Chen Ruihe to conduct a thorough investigation and report back for verification.</p>
<p>China Merchants to Lease Steamships: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is currently seeing a lack of ships in Shanghai despite ample cargo. Foreign merchants are seizing this great business opportunity. Therefore, the company is considering purchasing more ocean-going vessels. Previously, they had contacted Butterfield &amp; Swire regarding the purchase of three ships: "Shanxi," "Yunnan," and "Zhenjiang." However, a deal could not be reached due to price disagreements. The company's Shipping Department then changed its plan, opting to lease the "Fukang" steamer from the Da'an Company for transportation. Yesterday, Long Xiaju, the head of the Shipping Department, signed a ship leasing contract with Da'an. It is known that the "Fukang" steamer has a deadweight of 1,440 tons and can navigate both the Yangtze River and coastal waters. Once the ship is delivered, it will be immediately scheduled for service.</p>

<p>Commander Xiong's Speech at the Memorial Week</p>
<p>After the Wang Leping assassination case occurred, Chairman Chiang immediately wired the Shanghai Garrison Command, ordering a strict pursuit of the culprits for investigation and punishment. Commander Xiong, upon receiving the telegram, immediately ordered the investigation team to handle the case. Furthermore, at yesterday's memorial week, he gave a rather lengthy speech on the case. The record of the speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners reside together, with a mix of good and bad. In addition, due to the relationship with the concessions, the governing power cannot be unified. Therefore, murder, robbery, and other cruel and dark deeds occur daily. The recent Wang Leping assassination case is not considered particularly unusual in Shanghai. However, reactionary newspapers have spoken without restraint, claiming that it was done by the government. This kind of material usage, intentional fabrication of propaganda, has no particular value for attention. However, we who bear the local garrison responsibility should strictly pursue the culprits and investigate for punishment, regardless of who the victim is. As for the reactionary faction spewing blood and slandering the government, we certainly know where their intentions lie: one is to elevate Wang Leping's status, and the other is to put a bad name on the government. However, we can analyze it from a rational perspective. First, the current revolutionary government is not the revolutionary party during the period of secret work. It has the power to deal with any reactionary forces with open punishment and does not need to resort to such ambiguous and secretive means. Second, the current Chairman of the National Government, Mr. Chiang, is kind by nature and known for not being fond of killing. His colleagues all know this. For the captured reactionary elements, such as Li Zhilong, Liang Hongkai, and recently Li Jishen and Fang Zhenwu, all of whom are important reactionary elements, their reactionary deeds are also very obvious. However, Chairman Chiang has never imposed severe punishment on them. Third, anyone assassinated due to being reactionary must have special power or skills that must be removed and for which there is no other way to remove them. Thus, assassination is the last resort. Wang Leping is just a</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>common person. Although he is one of the leaders of the Reorganization clique, his reputation is not prominent, and his ability to cause trouble is not great. There are countless people of this kind. Where would you find so many to kill? Therefore, even if we retreat ten thousand steps, if the government has the need to assassinate reactionaries, it will definitely not start with an irrelevant Wang Leping. From the above three points of view, Wang Leping's death is completely irrelevant to the government. This is extremely clear. However, it is the duty of the Reorganization clique to use this topic to create a few reactionary slogans and write two propaganda articles, and it is not surprising at all. Although Wang Leping is someone the government has issued an arrest warrant for, no one may inflict punishment on him except through legal judgment. Therefore, the killer of Wang Leping is still committing a crime. Government agencies must punish the offender. Therefore, this command is currently conducting a strict investigation to catch the culprit. After the case is solved and the truth is revealed, the reactionary faction will have nothing to exploit.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Military Affairs Requests Inspection of Cotton and Military Blankets</p>
<p>The Quartermaster Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs previously needed a large amount of cotton for making military uniforms, cotton quilts, and mattresses. Unable to determine whether it was pure and of good quality, they sent personnel to the bureau twice with sample cotton to request chemical inspection on their behalf. The bureau's Cotton Inspection Office conducted a precise inspection and drafted a report as proof. The Ministry of Military Affairs was extremely satisfied. Later, they purchased a large batch of military blankets and still requested chemical inspection. After the bureau's Raw Silk Inspection Office completed the inspection and submitted a report, the Ministry of Military Affairs sent a letter of thanks, saying: "Our department purchases materials, and it is essential to ensure the quality is excellent. Without a detailed and accurate inspection, it is impossible to determine the quality of the whole. Your bureau does not avoid trouble and provides much assistance, benefiting us greatly. We are immensely grateful."</p>
<h3 id="e158">Grain Commission Resolves to Promote Sanitary Rice <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>And Discusses Handling Rice to Provide for the People's Food</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Grain Commission previously held its 12th regular meeting, discussing several important cases. Among them, the high price of rice has made the people's lives even more difficult. The Municipal Government had initially planned to order 100,000 piculs of foreign rice. However, the monetary industry was unwilling to undertake the temporary advance payment problem, which delayed the process. A solution should be discussed urgently to maintain the people's food supply. Also, according to Commissioner Ye Zhuanjun's report, the city has ordered 3,000,000 piculs of foreign rice, due by June. In addition to the 1,000,000 piculs that have already arrived, there are still 2,000,000 piculs. After discussion among the commissioners present, the large batch of rice arriving at the port is still not helping the people's food supply. A long-term plan should be carefully considered. The municipal government's handling of rice involves advance payments, and a guarantee should be provided assuming a certain degree of loss. Since the advance payments are short-term in nature, and there is a guarantee for the losses, the monetary industry should also fulfill its due obligations for the sake of the people's food security and public order. It was resolved to submit this to the authorities for approval. Commissioner Feng Liutang then proposed that improper consumption of rice be strictly prohibited, and sanitary rice should be promoted. It was resolved on the spot: (A) On the demand side, the results of the rice inspection and the current food situation should be announced to the public in detail by the Social Affairs Bureau to correct habits. (B) On the supply side, (1) the rice mills in the city should determine the standards for milled white rice and submit them to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and promulgation; (2) each rice store should display standard rice in a prominent place, labeled as "sanitary rice," and explain its functions to promote awareness. The signage will be jointly determined by the rice store industry association and this commission; (3) the price of sanitary rice in each rice store and mill should be lower than the so-called "ordinary special japonica rice" and should not be raised in the name; (4) each rice mill should send samples of sanitary rice to this commission, which will forward them to party and government agencies for promotion; (5) the business names and addresses of businesses and stores handling sanitary rice will be submitted by each trade association to this commission, which will forward them to the Social Affairs Bureau for public announcement. It was also resolved that the Xinchang Rice Mill and other factories would be responsible for the supply, and Commissioner Lu Wenshao would contact colleagues to designate several companies in each district to be responsible for promotion. Regarding the transfer and registration of transit and export rice, the committee also had opinions, which were discussed and passed.</p>

<p>List of New Board Candidates</p>
<p>Ms. Smith Must Await a Reply from the U.S. Government for Resolution</p>
<p>The Wenhui Bao reports that the election for the new board of the Shanghai Municipal Council is scheduled to take place on March 3rd and 4th. The deadline for submitting the list of candidates was 4:00 PM today (the 24th). There are twelve seats on the board, but there are fourteen candidates this year, so there is bound to be competition. The complete list of candidates is as follows: Three Americans, including Pastor Borden, Mr. Carney, and Ms. Smith, all newcomers; six British citizens, including Mr. Arnold, Major General MacNaghten, Mr. Massy, Mr. Scharbau, Mr. Peale, and Mr. Hughes; with the exception of Mr. Hughes, all are former board members; three Chinese citizens, namely Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and Xu Xinliu, all former board members; and two Japanese citizens, Fukushima and Saito, with Fukushima being a former board member and Saito a newcomer.</p>
<p>The Da Wan Bao reports that among the American candidates, Ms. Smith is the first woman to run for the board. However, as Ms. Smith is currently a commercial attache with the U.S. Department of Commerce, those who oppose women candidates have been arguing that Ms. Smith, as a public official, is ineligible to run. However, Ms. Smith remains calm. When a reporter visited her this morning, Ms. Smith said that she was not yet in a position to comment. However, this matter was discussed before she was nominated, and she was aware that the opposition would raise legal issues. The election is next Tuesday and Wednesday. It is heard that a telegram has already been sent to the State Department in Washington to inquire whether Ms. Smith's position allows her to be a candidate. It is expected that this matter will be resolved after a reply is received from the U.S. government.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Yichang First Spinning Mill <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Office Hosts Dinner for the Press Yesterday</p>
<p>Recently, Yichang City gentry and merchants Li Kunyuan, Li Chuncheng, Li Qingquan, Juxingcheng, Cai Yuncheng, Wang Yinchuan, Zhang Jianqiu, Wu Xiqing, and Liu Zhongchi, feeling that the city's commerce is in decline and the people's livelihood is almost exhausted, have jointly initiated the establishment of the Yichang First Spinning Mill to try to save the city. However, due to difficulties in raising capital, they have decided to set up a prize lottery fundraising method in addition to the Yichang gentry and merchants jointly contributing 300,000 yuan. They plan to raise funds from various ports upstream and downstream to gather strength and jointly develop inland resources. They have also sent Mr. Li Qingquan as a representative to visit the Hubei Provincial Government and the two ministries of Industry and Commerce and Finance to submit a petition for instructions. Mr. Li recently arrived in Shanghai and contacted the local industrial community, who unanimously supported the initiative as it relates to promoting industry. Yesterday afternoon, they held a banquet for reporters from various newspapers at the Tao Le Chun Restaurant on Sanma Road, reporting in detail on the reasons for the establishment of the factory and the preparations. Mr. Li said briefly: Yichang is the gateway to western Hubei and the throat of western Sichuan. In the past, transportation between Sichuan and Hubei relied entirely on wooden boats to transport goods back and forth and exchange goods for life. It is estimated that there are no less than several thousand ships. Each large ship requires hundreds of laborers, and smaller ones require dozens. More than 100,000 laborers rely on this to support their families, not including porters. Since the development of steamship transport, wooden boats have been decreasing year by year. Millions of laborers have switched to transporting opium for a living. Now, the national government is strictly enforcing the opium ban, and the number of unemployed vagrants is increasing. The immediate need is to set up factories to take in the poor, which is also the first purpose of establishing the factory. Yichang is located in the area where Sichuan and Hubei intersect. Ships traveling back and forth must be inspected here before they can be loaded and transported. In the past, the shipping rates of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Butterfield &amp; Swire, and Jardine Matheson were the same from Shanghai to Hankou, from Hankou to Yichang, and from Yichang to Sichuan, and were not allowed to be increased or decreased. Recently, foreign merchants, understanding that domestic shipping companies do not have the capacity to add ships, have steeply increased the number of ships sailing between Sichuan, Yichang, Shanghai, and Hankou while our shipping rights have not yet been recovered. The goods carried are directly transferred to steamships in the river for transportation. Since May of last year, the freight rates for goods transported to Sichuan have been suddenly reduced. The goods are inspected at customs in Shanghai once and go directly to Sichuan, without the need for inspection and transshipment in Yichang. This kind of economic invasion has already been implemented. Not only is the Yichang Customs equal to a fictitious organization, but also warehouses have been abandoned and useless. The laborers who relied on transshipment for a living, and the local market, are completely in a desperate situation. Although the labor community has automatically negotiated, it is not a fundamental solution. The immediate need is to set up factories to take in the poor, which is also another purpose of establishing the factory. The establishment of factories is indeed an urgent plan for the present. Judging from the situation in Yichang, the establishment of a spinning mill is the most appropriate. The Yichang area and nearby Jiangkou and Dongshi have always produced large quantities of cotton, which are transported to Shanghai and Hankou to supply raw materials to foreign spinning mills. However, Jiangkou and Dongshi can also produce no less than 2 million bolts of native cloth each year, and the raw materials needed for cotton yarn are still transported back from Shanghai and Hankou for supply. If a spinning mill is established locally, local materials can be supplied for local use, and the benefits are obvious. However, the establishment of a spinning mill cannot be operated with a small amount of capital. There are not many wealthy people in Yichang, and there is little production. Since the reform, it has been devastated by warlords several times. The most tragic thing is that the town was robbed twice during the years 1920 and 1921, and few were spared. The local vitality has been greatly damaged and has not yet recovered. In addition, the public's thinking is backward, so it is difficult to concentrate finances. Furthermore, the spinning mill industry has never existed in Yichang, so people are suspicious and hesitant to invest. All these are the reasons why Yichang should have established a spinning mill long ago but has not been able to do so. If we want to reverse this dangerous situation at present and seek industrial development, it is difficult to raise this kind of huge sum without special methods. After repeated discussions, it was decided that the share capital would be 1.3 million yuan. The initiators would recognize a total of 300,000 yuan in Yichang as preferred shares, and the remaining 1 million yuan would be ordinary shares. The method of integrating rewards into fundraising would be adopted to stimulate the interest of investors. Whether the issued shares win a prize or not, they will all be used as share capital to exchange for the factory's shares. Once it is finished and the amount is full. The money lost due to winning prizes will be gradually compensated for in the surplus in the future. Once the funds are collected, the first spinning mill will be opened first, and expansion will be planned. This is the most important measure to rescue Yichang. The reason why this fundraising for the spinning mill is not for personal gain, but because it is seen that Yichang is located in the important town of Sichuan and Hubei, with convenient transportation. If we take advantage of this transitional period and speed up construction and seek industrial development, it is a promising commercial market for the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in the future. Otherwise, sitting idly by and watching the local resources not developed will not only cause the economy to wither, life will be difficult, people's wisdom will be clumsy, and customs will be bad. The hidden worries of the future are truly unbearable. At present, the spinning mill company's articles of association, business budget, financial overview, and fundraising prize certificates, prize numbers, etc. have all been prepared. They will be submitted to the provincial government and the two ministries of industry and commerce and finance within the next few days for approval. In order to implement it, we hope that the public will provide practical guidance, so that we can see its success as soon as possible. The future of industry will be very fortunate.</p>

<p>The Bandit Force Expanded at the Intersection of Three Counties</p>
<p>Recently, a large gang of bandits has suddenly appeared in the Pinghu, Zhengyi, Yiyu, and Caopeng towns at the intersection of Nantong, Rugao, and Haimen counties outside Wusongkou. The situation is rampant and abnormal, occupying the area for more than ten days. The scope has expanded more than before. Several places in the territory of Jingjiang, Taixian, and Taixing counties have also been ravaged by bandits. After hearing the news, the Jiangsu Provincial Government immediately dispatched the Provincial Public Security Team to encircle and suppress them, and appointed Li Changjiang, the captain of the Provincial Public Security Team, as the commander-in-chief of the bandits. However, the bandits are quite cunning. When the Provincial Public Security Team pursues and suppresses them, they flee here and there, making it difficult to achieve success for a while. Commander Li, feeling that the strength of the bandits is weak, has transferred more than 600 county police officers from the respective counties the day before yesterday to form a bandit suppression team at any time. It is scheduled to join the Provincial Public Security Team and the water police to encircle and suppress them immediately, in the hope of wiping out the bandits in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3 id="e166">After the Dissolution of the Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>New Unity of Small Merchants</p>
<p>More Than Thirty Associations Including Stall Vendors</p>
<p>Decide to Organize a Joint Office</p>
<p>Various vendor, merchant, and boatman associations in this city have been exceedingly alarmed recently due to the dissolution of the chamber of commerce branch and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's proposal, passed by the Legislative Yuan, stating that vendors and merchants with mobile businesses are not allowed to form associations. Yesterday, various vendor associations held an extraordinary delegate conference. Representatives from the vegetable vendor branch, fresh medicine association, Jiangbei Shanghai-bound fresh pork transport merchant association, glutinous rice vendor branch, merchant boat association, book vendor branch, sand boat association, chicken vendor branch, vegetable commodity association, duck vendor branch, Yimiao Yu Garden branch, Huangyan fruit association, book vendor association, French Concession vendor association, cloth vendor association, hat cleaning vendor branch, and more than thirty other associations, totaling over one hundred representatives, unanimously elected Zheng Tingkang, Wang Lixian, Qin Boxiao, and Yan [missing character] as the presidium. After the meeting commenced with due ceremony, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting. Representatives then successively voiced their opinions, generally stating that Shanghai stall vendors lease stall spaces at small vegetable markets and obtain licenses from the Public Security Bureau or the Municipal Council to operate at a fixed address without moving. Brokers and boatmen have fixed markets and communication addresses, but their capital is small and there is no mobility. However, Article 1 of the same law states that legitimate businesses can organize trade associations. Each trade fulfills its tax obligations and cannot be considered an informal merchant. Small-capital merchants are the most suffering and oppressed class, and under the clear light of day, they cannot be without organizational structures. Thereupon, the following resolutions were passed: (1) issue a declaration, (2) petition the central government, the municipal party headquarters, and the municipal social bureau for relief, (3) organize a joint office named the Shanghai Special Municipality Thirty-odd Trade Association Joint Office, with a temporary communication address at No. 1, Tongchun Lane, Qing Street, Nine Acres, (4) each association shall appoint one representative as an officer of the joint office, (5) the first representative meeting will be held at 2 PM on the 26th at the temporary communication address to discuss progress.</p>

<p>Warehouse Guarantee Payment Measures</p>
<p>Shipping Companies' Request Not Approved by the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Special Municipal Government previously ordered the Finance, Port Affairs, and Land Bureaus to temporarily implement measures for increasing and modifying the payment of guarantee deposits for the use of docks and warehouses. After the Finance and Port Affairs Bureaus convened a meeting of various shipping companies, they submitted a request to the Municipal Government for verification. The request concerned the joint submission of a case. The Municipal Government's Instruction No. 1527 stated that the proposed "Provisional Regulations for the Payment of Guarantee Deposits for the Use of Docks and Warehouses in the Shanghai Special Municipality" had been resolved by the 130th Municipal Conference. Article 6 of the original proposal, regarding whether to stipulate the total amount of the guarantee and Article 7 regarding whether the guarantee deposit should bear interest or whether the interest rate should be appropriately reduced, should be handled through joint consultation between the Director of the Port Affairs Bureau and the Director of the Finance Bureau, with full authority, and reported to the Mayor for approval at any time. Therefore, the instruction was recorded and issued to the bureau. In addition to issuing separate instructions, the bureaus were ordered to comply. The original proposal was copied and issued. In compliance with this, the Port Affairs Bureau and the Finance Bureau convened a meeting with representatives of major shipping companies at the Public Service Club to discuss the total amount of the guarantee and the interest rate. After repeated research, it was agreed that the total amount of the guarantee would be 70,000 silver dollars, with an annual interest rate of 5%. In addition, regarding the term of use, it was slightly modified based on the period stipulated by the Land Bureau for leasing public land, stipulating that it should not exceed fifteen years, but could be applied for to continue for fifteen years after the expiration to facilitate and demonstrate restrictions. The Provisional Regulations were implemented in accordance with the above-mentioned agreed-upon measures, which were amended separately. Subsequently, because the allocation and acknowledgement of the guarantee amount by the shipping companies was not easily determined at one time, and the docks and warehouses were related to the public land along the riverbanks, on the 15th of this month, the Finance Bureau, Land Bureau, and Port Affairs Bureau convened a meeting with shipping company representatives at the Port Affairs Bureau to discuss the distribution of dock and warehouse land and allocate the amount of the guarantee deposit. Shipping companies such as Sanbei Company, etc., acknowledged the amount of the guarantee deposit according to the above-mentioned agreement and paid it in three installments, and a draft contract was signed. As for the Provisional Regulations for Guarantee Deposits, the above-mentioned amended measures remained unchanged. However, the shipping companies argued that the burden of the guarantee amount was too high, and the original regulations stipulated that 50% would be returned in five years. They requested that it be changed to 70% returned in seven years. The bureaus considered that since the regulations had already been stipulated, they dared not make a decision on their own, and humbly requested that the government consider the difficulties of the merchants and approve the request. After the Mayor received the report and reviewed it, he found that the amended measures were sound, but did not approve the shipping companies' request to change the guarantee deposit from 50% returned in five years to 70% returned in seven years, and ordered the bureau to comply.</p>

<p>Chen Tianxi Released from Captivity</p>
<p>Hostage Hidden in Sanlintang Town</p>
<p>Search for Kidnappers at Jintai Hotel</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Recounts Negotiating Price with Kidnappers</p>
<p>Detectives Bravely Capture Kidnappers in the Rain</p>
<p>The case of Chen Tianxi, Municipal Commissioner of the Shanghai Special Municipality and native place fellowman, who was kidnapped in the Huangpu River, was solved by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Squad yesterday morning in Sanlintang, Pudong. The hostage was rescued on the spot, and six male and female kidnappers were captured. When the arrest was made, the hostage was in danger of being killed. The details of the investigation are reported below:</p>
<p>Buying Supplies: Since the news of Mr. Chen's kidnapping in the Huangpu River on the night of the 20th of this month, all of Shanghai has been shocked. Details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. At that time, Police Chief Yuan Liang issued a large reward and instructed his subordinates to solve the case within ten days. Detective Squad Chief Qiao Songsheng immediately secretly instructed his subordinates to conduct a strict investigation. At the same time, he purchased supplies and spared no effort. Unexpectedly, the night before last, Chief Qiao received a secret report from an informant that a major suspect in the case was hiding in Room 105 of the Jintai Hotel on Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, and requested that officers be sent to arrest him immediately. After receiving the report, Chief Qiao, although it was already late at night, immediately traveled light with only one attendant. First, he contacted the relevant police station, and then went directly to Room 105 of the hotel to wait.</p>
<p>Rescuing the Hostage Across the River: Chief Qiao urgently telegraphed Deputy Squad Leader Lu Ying to lead a large number of detectives, including Zhang Guangsen, Fu Zhengcai, Qi Haitan, Shan Bin, Wang Yao, Gu Liancheng, Dou Yulin, Han Ruisheng, Zhu Baosheng, Han Jingxiang, Liu Siyu, Wu Zuorong, Hou Shenghan, Wang Hengshan, each riding motorcycles, hiding weapons, and accompanied by informants, departed from the team at 12:10 AM, crossed the river to Pudong. It was raining heavily at the time, and the ground was extremely slippery. All the detectives advanced in the rain. At 2:00 AM, they arrived at Sanlintang in Pudong. The rain was even heavier, and it was too dark to distinguish east from west. The detectives squatted in the fields, waiting for dawn. It was not until 5:30 AM that the sky began to dawn, and they proceeded again. Before long, they reached the place where the hostage was hidden. First, the informant confirmed that it was correct and reported to Deputy Squad Leader Lu.</p>
<p>Close Call: The detectives reached their destination and ordered the informant to identify it clearly first. Squad Leader Lu then surveyed the surroundings and saw five or six newly built bungalows in a lonely courtyard, surrounded by bamboo fences, with ditches dug around them two to three feet deep. Squad Leader Lu immediately ordered a separate哨to guard each important entrance. Immediately, he led the team and bravely charged in, directly into the room behind the灶披间 (kitchen shed) according to what the informant said. Unexpectedly, the kidnappers had heard the alarm and were prepared. When the detectives reached the room, one of the kidnappers immediately pulled out a pistol and turned around to fire a shot at the hostage. Fortunately, it missed and the bullet grazed the hostage's left arm, only three or four inches away. It was indeed a close call.</p>
<p>Risky Capture: At this critical moment, detectives Shan Bin and Han Jingxiang bravely stepped forward, hugged the kidnapper, and seized the gun (a new-style six-inch Browning No. 232813). The remaining kidnappers scrambled to hide under the bed. Squad Leader Lu was at the side and quickly ordered that the hostage Chen Tianxi be dragged out to safety first. At this time, the detectives outside the door heard the gunshot and rushed in. The kidnappers were then captured one by one. A total of seven male and female kidnappers were captured. Squad Leader Lu ordered them to be handcuffed one by one. Unexpectedly, when the kidnapper who fired the shot was being handcuffed on one hand, the other hand suddenly drooped down. Fortunately, detective Han Ruisheng was on the side, became suspicious when he saw this, and suddenly picked up his hand. After searching his body again, another six-inch loaded Browning pistol was found in his trouser pocket. The bullet was loaded and ready to fire at any moment. What was most laughable was that when the kidnapper who fired the shot was being arrested, he shouted loudly (I am the hostage, please do not misunderstand), etc.</p>
<p>Interrogation One by One: The group of criminals and the hostage Chen Tianxi were escorted across the river together and taken directly to the team. After Chief Qiao interrogated them one by one, the kidnapper who fired the shot confessed his name as Chen Shaorong, 21 years old, from Wuchang, Hubei; one named Yang Zhongwen, from Zigui, Hubei, 24 years old; one named Gong Deyi, from Yichang, Hubei, 28 years old; one named Chen Maotou, 23 years old, from Tongzhou; one named Zhou Lianbao (nickname Erbaiwu), from Tongzhou, 27 years old (Zhou was the one who cut the mooring rope with a knife at the time); the kidnapper's wife, Tang Li, 42 years old, from Yangsiqiao Township; and Li's daughter, Tang Yunzhen, 20 years old, all directly confessed to conspiring to kidnap Chen and rob the boat. Furthermore, the kidnapper's wife, Tang Li, confessed that her elder brother, a bandit leader, was hiding in Room 303 of the Dongya Hotel in the concession. Chief Qiao, based on the confession, immediately dispatched the original detectives to the concession to go to the address with the police to arrest him. Unexpectedly, the bandit had already fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Acted as a Blind Man: After the reporter of this newspaper heard the news of Mr. Chen's escape from danger, he immediately went to visit him. He was kind enough to tell me everything that happened in detail (the following are all Mr. Chen's words). At 5:25 PM on the 20th of this month, I boarded the South Automobile Company's ferry to the north of Bailianjing. The bandits drove all the passengers on the ferry to the back tugboat, leaving me alone on the ferry. At that time, I was imprisoned in the stern of the boat. When the boat sailed to the north of Wangjiadu, all the windows of the boat were completely closed. Then I was blindfolded with a white cloth at any time. Not long after, someone carried me onto a barge. After about five minutes, the boat docked. A bandit carried me to a field on the shore. After another ten minutes, the white cloth was removed from my eyes and replaced with a pair of black glasses. I walked along the bank. After about another ten minutes, I suddenly heard gunshots from behind. The bandits immediately stopped and dragged me to the field and lay down next to the grave together. After the gunshots were a little further away, we started walking again. Whenever we crossed a bridge, the bandits carried me on their backs. After walking for about three hours, we reached the place where I was being held.</p>
<p>Negotiating the Ransom: There were nine bandits traveling with me, but when I entered the room, a bandit took off my glasses and blindfolded me with a white cloth again. After entering the room, the bandit did not take any action on the first day. There were six guards. On the second day, one of the guards wearing a long blue cloth shirt told me to write a letter to my family. The bandits drafted the letter and instructed me to copy it. They asked me how much ransom I was willing to pay. I immediately replied that my family really had no money and could only cover the losses. The bandits said that they had already spent 30,000 yuan. I replied that 30,000 yuan was impossible, but 3,000 to 4,000 yuan would be acceptable. They demanded 50,000 yuan. The bandit in the blue cloth shirt said, [unreadable word] there is no such amount, and we will kill you. One of the bandits pretended to persuade, saying, we will reduce it a little, and you must increase it a little.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Kill the Hostage: On the 22nd, the boss, as the bandits called him, in the next room went out at 4:00 AM and returned to the hideout at 5:00 PM. Then the bandit in the blue robe contacted the boss and then came into the room to ask me how much I was willing to pay, or they would ask the commander-in-chief to not take your money and kill you immediately. I replied that I would increase it by one or two thousand yuan. On the morning of the 23rd, at 4:00 AM, the bandit boss went out again and returned at about 4:00 PM. The bandit in the blue robe negotiated with the boss again and then came to my room again, saying that it was not proper to talk to you myself, and that I would go to Shanghai to handle it. He then took out a letter draft and ordered me to copy it again.</p>
<p>Copy it in Shanghai to Negotiate: I chose a few names, but the bandits did not recognize them, saying that they were the masters with rights, they only wanted you to write to He Yingmei, the letter said roughly that I was in the bandit's lair and my life was in danger. Please come out quickly to negotiate and do not let the Municipal Council know. They said not to talk about the price. After another hour or two, the bandits deliberated for a long time and said that the situation in Shanghai was very tense. If there was any other action outside, they would kill the hostage first. Last night, the prevention was very strict. Today (the 24th), at 4:00 AM, the bandit boss came to Shanghai again. At about 6:00 AM, officers from the Public Security Bureau came and rescued me. This is the whole story of the kidnapping.</p>
<p>Continued Capture of a Bandit: When Chief Qiao was at the Jintai Hotel, he urgently telegraphed Zhabei Foreman Wang Shifu, Su Sheng, Gao Wansheng, and detectives Gao Juchuan, Wang Peiwen, and Ding Shunbao to the hotel to wait. They waited until dusk at about 5:00 PM. Suddenly, a man wearing a small hat, short stature, short beard, wearing a dark-colored straight贡呢 (tribute cloth) mandarin jacket, woolen camel hair robe, about 40 years old, went to the hotel to ask the accountant if anyone was in Room 105. After asking, he hurriedly went out. At that time, the detectives were on the side and immediately tracked him, chasing him all the way to No. 129 Yunnan Road, where he was finally caught. He was temporarily detained at the police station. After the police chief asked him briefly, he confessed his name as Ye A'an (i.e., Ye Peiwen), a native of Yangsi Township. The rest of his confession was vague. The detectives urgently reported to the team leader by telephone to come and pick him up and bring him back to be interrogated.</p>
<p>Order of Commendation: After Chief Qiao interrogated the criminals, he reported to the chief, Yuan, who commended the two team leaders for successfully solving major cases one after another and for their effective leadership. Before the end of February this year, they had solved three kidnapping cases, which was commendable. The Chen case occurred this time, and it was solved in only three days, which was even more commendable. All the officers who contributed will be rewarded separately in the future.</p>

<p>Shops Sued for Not Affixing Stamps</p>
<p>No Need to Invite团to Observe According to Regulations</p>
<p>American Consul Meng Haite Wants to Appear in Court</p>
<p>Judge Zhou Xianjue's Strong Argument</p>
<p>Shops in the concession have been issued notices by the competent authorities and the court regarding the affixing of stamps. It is required to purchase and affix stamps in accordance with the regulations. Those who violate the regulations will be fined. However, there are still many who comply in appearance but disobey in reality. For example, Taifeng Company on Nanjing Road, Weixin Shoe Store, Shanghai Company, Yuanfengrun Candle Shop on Dongxinqiao Street, Hongshun Shop on Qipan Street, Southeast Hosiery Factory in Zhoujin Lane, Hankou Road, Tongxing Coal Shop on Haining Road, Duyuanji Coal Shop, Baoxing Shop on North Sichuan Road, and Lao Hujiangchun Restaurant did not affix stamps on the invoices they issued. The Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau's investigators found this to be true and reported it to the director, stating that these shops intentionally violated the Stamp Tax Regulations. The business locations of these shops are all under the Public Concession. Therefore, lawyer Chen Zemin was instructed to file a complaint with the Provisional Court, requesting that the shops be summoned to court and punished according to law. The trial was originally scheduled for noon yesterday by Judge Zhou Xianjue. Judge Zhou believed that the case did not [missing characters] Committee to attend the trial, and was about to hold a separate hearing when Mr. Meng Haite, the American Vice Consul, a member of the [团], suddenly came to the judge's chambers and demanded to appear in court together. Judge Zhou argued with him according to the law, but could not make a decision for a long time. Therefore, the case could not be tried and must be reported to President Xu for approval.</p>

<p>Scamming Extortionist Xia Tingsheng, Kidnappers Ding Sanlin and Hu Shangzhou</p>
<p>Scamming extortionist Xia Tingsheng, using the name of the Fifth Army Headquarters of the Chinese Communist Army stationed in Shanghai, wrote threatening letters to 42 families including Yao Ziliang, Yang Wenqing, Zhu Shenqing, Li Yangsheng, and Bao Xiangtao.

The Old Zha Police arrested Ding and Hu successively, recovered the hostage, sent them to the Provisional Court, and sentenced them to death. The sentence was submitted to the Provincial Government for approval, and the execution by firing squad was carried out.

They were then escorted to the Caohejing Second Prison execution ground to await execution. A letter was sent to the District Court requesting execution. District Commissioner Li Gongchen, as the supervising officer, ordered police officer Yang Deshan and police inspector Chen Xihui to lead ten police officers in cars to the execution ground.

<p>Banning the "Die Hard" Movie</p>
<p>Film Review Committee Held a Meeting Yesterday The Shanghai Municipal Film Censorship Committee held a special meeting yesterday (the 24th) at 1:00 PM. Attendees included Chen Duanzhi, Zhang Meisun, Sun Yongyi, Yao Gengkui, Mi Jifang, Dong Zhihe, Ge Jiadong, and Chen Dezheng. Chen Dezheng was the chairman, and Lu Haiyuan was the recorder. Matters reported: The chairman reported that the Grand Theater and the Guanglu Theater in the Special Area of the city have recently been showing the sound film "Die Hard" starring the American actress Locke. The film is set in Chinatown in the United States and depicts the Chinese people as thieves, kidnappers, opium dealers, and other kinds of base, savage, and terrible behavior, insulting the Chinese people in every possible way, and having a significant impact on our national honor and international status. Citizens and party departments have criticized the committee a lot. The committee's responsibility is undeniable. However, the committee also has its own difficulties. This city has extensive concessions and special treaties that serve as a shield for unscrupulous merchants, so that the domestic administrative organs cannot interfere with anything administrative within the concessions. At the beginning of the committee's establishment, it immediately paid attention to this, and therefore stipulated that (regardless of Chinese or foreign films, any films that have not been inspected and approved by the committee are not allowed to be exported or imported, and films that have not been inspected and approved by the committee are not allowed to be extracted from the customs or railway bureau) in order to remedy the situation. Since the implementation of this plan, all movie theaters and film companies in the concessions have rushed to submit Chinese and foreign films for inspection, and the process has been exceptionally smooth. However, this plan suddenly received instructions from the Executive Yuan on January 8 of this year to postpone implementation, and the theaters and film companies within the concessions have become reckless again, watching and waiting as before. The committee's exercise of its powers has also suffered various difficulties as a result. The reason why the Grand Theater and the Guanglu Theater dared to show films that insult our nation without any scruples this time is also undoubtedly due to this influence. Although the committee has now sent letters to various newspapers to cancel all advertisements published by the Grand Theater and the Guanglu Theater, and to notify all citizens not to watch them, and has also submitted a request to the municipal government for strict negotiations, these are temporary remedies and not a fundamental solution. Therefore, this special meeting was convened to discuss concrete measures to deal with the situation. Matters discussed: (1) How should we deal with the Grand Theater and the Guanglu Theater's showing of the film "Die Hard," which insults the Chinese people? Please discuss the case together. Decisions: (1) Please ask the municipal government to consult the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education to order film inspection agencies in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country to ban it. (2) Please ask the municipal government to submit a request to the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the US government to prohibit the film from being shown in any country. (3) Please ask the municipal government to send a letter to the Provisional Court to severely punish the persons in charge of the Grand Theater and the Guanglu Theater who showed the humiliating film, and immediately prohibit the film from being shown. (4) Together with the Municipal Propaganda Department, send a letter to various newspapers, stating that no advertisements for the two theaters will be allowed to be published until this case is resolved. (5) Order all theaters to ban the showing of all films starring Locke (except those that have been approved after review), and send a letter to the Municipal Propaganda Department. (6) Submit a report to the municipal government, which will then be submitted to the Executive Yuan, recounting the process and remedial measures. (7) Send a letter to the Jianghai Customs and the Railway Bureau to prohibit the export of the film "Die Hard." (8) Warn Locke. (9) Inquire about Guan Huizhi in the name of the committee. (10) Express condolences to Mr. Hong Shen.</p>
<p>Letter from the Taxpayers' Association to the Public Works Bureau The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers' Chinese Association sent a letter to the Public Concession Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Sirs, it is reported that the Grand Theater and the Guanglu Theater are showing the film "Die Hard," the content of which insults our nation. After investigation, the showing of this film is likely to cause outrage among the people of our country, directly affecting public order, and indirectly affecting diplomatic relations. Your bureau's failure to conduct a strict review in advance has already caused a major dispute. We are writing to request your bureau to quickly stop the film from being shown and order it to be burned, in order to appease public anger, and to ensure that no theater will be allowed to show any film that is likely to cause resentment among the people of our country and cause major disputes in the future."</p>
<p>The Anti-Opium Society's Opinion on the Ban The National Anti-Opium Society issued a statement yesterday expressing its opinion on the ban of the "Die Hard" movie, stating: "International forces have repeatedly used counter-propaganda to slander our country on the opium issue, such as (1) overseas newspapers and magazines often publish texts slandering our country on the opium issue, (2) the former Beijing International Anti-Opium Society privately investigated the opium situation in our country and arbitrarily fabricated information for the world, (3) the Far East Opium Investigation Group will come to China soon, their intention is nothing more than to use this to embellish the facts and implement their opium policy, (4) on the League of Nations, representatives of various countries often criticize our country's efforts to ban opium, while concealing the fact that they are poisoning and harming our overseas Chinese in their various territories in Nanyang, (5) the United States has always been very supportive of our country's anti-opium movement, and the extreme insults in the "Die Hard" movie are also a kind of counter-propaganda on China's opium issue. Not only should our people rise up to resist, but also for the sake of the US authorities, they should take the initiative to ban it as soon as possible, so as to avoid a major misunderstanding between China and the United States. Our society will ask the Film Censorship Committee to make a serious representation, and because Mr. Hong Shen is the director of our society's Art Committee, he has deeply assisted our society's anti-opium film education. He was outraged by the matter and generously exposed it. Our society believes that the film industry has reduced an anti-anti-opium film. We deeply sympathize with the five measures proposed by Mr. Hong."</p>

<h3 id="e178">The Dalun Real Estate Lease Termination Case <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Appeal Verdict Postponed</p>
<p>Oral Agreement Between Landlord and Tenant</p>
<p>The Court Believes an Investigation is Necessary</p>
<p>Because Dalun Real Estate Company wanted to demolish the city buildings it owned at the corner of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road to build a nine-story mansion, and lease it to the Great China Department Store, it notified the existing tenants, including Laoda Fang, etc., a total of seventeen households, to move out by a certain date. However, the tenants claimed that they had an oral agreement with Dalun when they leased the property, stating that renovations could only be done after twenty years. Now, the longest-term tenant has only been there for seven or eight years, so they all decided not to move, and a lawsuit was filed. The initial trial in the Provisional Court ruled against the tenants. Fifteen shops filed an appeal. The details of the trial have already been reported in the previous newspaper. The case was originally scheduled to be announced by the Court of Appeal yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM. The tenants gathered at the Second Tribunal of the court in the afternoon, and the number of people was quite large. The lawyers for both sides also appeared in court one after another. When the time came, Hu Yigu, the presiding judge of the Civil Division of the Court of Appeal, and two judges took their seats. Judge Hu immediately declared, "This case was originally scheduled to be announced today. However, the appellants claimed that they had an oral agreement with the landlord when they leased the property. The court believes that an investigation of this point is necessary. What is the custom in Shanghai? Is an oral agreement valid? We will investigate the matter and then reschedule the debate before making a fair judgment in order to convince everyone." The lawyers and parties involved in the case each dispersed and returned home.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Ship Damage in Heavy Fog <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>In the past two days, there has been heavy fog, and ships in the Huangpu River have been unable to distinguish routes. Therefore, the incidents of cargo ships being in danger, colliding, and sinking are described as follows: The Runda Xiang ship, carrying foreign goods and factory cloth worth 13,000 to 14,000 taels, hired the Wang Maomao ship to go to the Jiahu area of Zhejiang Province. On the morning of the day before yesterday, it sailed to the vicinity of the South Huangpu River and the Mao River. The heavy fog was dense, and it was impossible to distinguish the road. It was about to sail to the beach to dock when it collided with the Chen Changsheng oil tanker that was sheltering from the fog there. The bow of the Wang ship was broken and the tide poured in, gradually sinking. Wang and five of his crew members fell into the water. Fortunately, they all knew how to swim and floated to the beach and landed. However, the shipowner Wang Maomao has disappeared. The middle cabin of the Chen ship was damaged by the collision, and the oil baskets were broken, and the oil flowed out. A sailor named Qiaosheng was knocked into the river when the collision occurred, and Chen used a pole to fish for him without success. Half of the 200 baskets of oil were broken, resulting in a great loss. The Wang ship sank, fortunately in a shallow place. The foreign goods boxes loaded on the deck were exposed a few inches above the water. Runda Xiang hired a ship to salvage them, but due to the high tide, the salvage was difficult. Fortunately, the goods were insured for water damage, and the company is now consulting on salvage methods. In addition, the Xiangji oil mill in Huzhou had 300 bags of soybeans loaded onto the Wu Gengsheng ship to be transported from Shanghai. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, in the Chenjiahangpu River area, the fog was even heavier, and it mistakenly swept onto the stone embankment, and suddenly overturned. The hull of the ship was smashed, and the hull was horizontally moored there, with the mast sticking out of the water. However, because the soybeans swelled after being exposed to water, the hull of the ship burst. Even if it is salvaged, it cannot carry goods. In addition, the Nanqiao flower factory loaded 240 bales of Huayi Sheng ship flowers to Shanghai. In Dujiahang, a Ningbo ship suddenly collided violently, and the bows of both ships were broken. Two of You's crew were knocked down, and one of the Ningbo ship was also hit. At that time, salvage was difficult. Although the two ships did not sink, they suffered considerable losses. In addition, there were many cargo ships that were damaged by fog on the way.</p>

<p>Number of Pedestrians and Vehicles on Each Road</p>
<p>Preparing for Improved Traffic Management</p>
<p>In view of the increasing population and vehicles in the city, and the increasingly complex traffic situation, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, in order to improve traffic management on each road as a whole, must first conduct a thorough investigation of the traffic conditions on each busy road as a basis for design. Therefore, since a week ago, staff have been dispatched from 6:00 AM to 8:00 PM every day to record the actual number of pedestrians and various vehicles in the Laoximen area, separately, for statistics. After a week, the matter was completed. The work was carried out in the Xiaodongmen area in the same way last week. Starting this week, the work will continue on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. It is reported that after the bureau completes the statistics in the future, it will plan to install red and green traffic lights on each road to improve the efficiency of traffic management. It is also understood that if the traffic lights are installed at intersections with many pedestrians and few vehicles, it will have an adverse impact on traffic, so this investigation is really necessary.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government approved the joint letter from the Shanghai Special Municipal Social and Finance Bureaus yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, after investigation, open-air merchants in this city must obtain a license from this bureau, etc., before they can operate in the designated area. This license was previously levied annually or quarterly in different grades. Now, after considering the situation, the bureau, etc., has changed it to monthly licenses, and the tax rate has been appropriately increased. It has been submitted to the municipal government for instructions and approval, and will be implemented from January of this year. However, after investigation, the fruit merchants in the 16th Pier area have obtained business licenses from the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and their business scope is limited to the fruit industry only. How can they also deal in vegetables, which hinders the business of open-air merchants? In addition to ordering the industry to prohibit concurrent operations, we are sending a letter to your government for review."</p>

<p>Deceased's Family Requests Exhumation for Inspection</p>
<p>Wu Shunren, of 697 Yuanhe Lane, East Yalu Road, hanged himself on the 27th of last month. His cousin Wu Dazhi and nephew Wu Jianyin suspected that Wu Shunren had been strangled to death, and that Guan Tiren, the second landlord of the deceased, was also not without suspicion. They hired a lawyer to petition the Provisional Court for an exhumation to clarify the truth. According to the news from the deceased's family, the case will be heard in the Provisional Court on Wednesday. The plaintiffs Wu Dazhi and Wu Jianyin will be accompanied by their representative lawyer to the court. Wu Riren, the brother of the deceased, also rushed to Shanghai from Yancheng last Saturday, so that he could go to court together tomorrow. According to Wu Dazhi, his cousin hanged himself on the 27th of last month. The deceased's wife, Wu Xu, and her father did not notify his family of Wu Shunren's death, nor did they handle the funeral for the deceased. Instead, the second landlord of the deceased, Guan Tiren, reported it to the police. When the case was heard on Friday last week, Judge Gao said that Wu Riren, the deceased's brother, must come to Shanghai to sign and seal the petition, and be responsible for the request before the exhumation and inspection could be approved. Now that Wu Riren has arrived in Shanghai and is allowed to go to court tomorrow, the truth of the case will be revealed.</p>

<p>Cao Linmei's Mother Died, Pitiful</p>
<p>Cao Wenrong Favors Concubine, Incompatible</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the Gaoqiao Banggaoxing ferry had just left Shanghai when it arrived at the Huangpu River near Lujiazui. Suddenly, a young woman jumped into the river, intending to commit suicide. Fortunately, the old dock master stopped the machine and rescued her, saving her life. She was sent to the nearby water police station. According to the girl's confession, her name is Cao Linmei, she is 24 years old and from Pudong. Her father's name is Wenrong, and he runs Shunxing Hardware Store at the southern end of Baxianqiao in the French Concession. Her stepmother, Zhao, treats her badly because she is not her own daughter. If she is slightly dissatisfied, she will roar loudly. Her father loves his stepmother and does not regret the pain his daughter suffers every day. The attitude is very different from when her mother was alive. She does not want to die easily, but it is difficult to live in this kind of family. Today, she slightly disobeyed her stepmother's wishes and was blamed again. She was extremely angry and complained to her father, but was not understood. So she pretended to go out to buy vegetables, went to Nanjing Road alone, took a boat to the Huangpu River, and ended her life. According to the confession, the police chief ordered Detective Ge Changsheng to go to the address and bring her father to the police station, warning him and ordering him to take his daughter Linmei back home and treat her kindly, so as to avoid repeating the same mistake.</p>

<p>Zhou Yu, a woman from Shaoxing, lived in a house at 1 Taopeng Road, Yangshupu. At 3:00 PM on the 22nd, she took her three-year-old child out to buy sesame cakes. When she returned, she saw that the house was on fire and it was beyond repair. Her newborn child of 21 days was lying in the room. She braved the fire to enter the room, but she could not retrieve it. Her head, face, and hands were burned. She shouted for help. Firefighters arrived at the scene and put out the fire with water. Four or five bungalows were burned down, and the newborn child was buried in the fire pit. The police then took the child's body out and sent it to the autopsy site on Philen Road, and reported it to the Provisional Court. Judge Sun Yuan went to the site yesterday morning to verify that the child had indeed been burned to death. He took his seat and questioned Zhou Yu about the situation. Because she did not want to claim the body, Sun ordered that the child's body be handed over to Pushan Villa for a coffin and burial.</p>

<p>Ding Huibiao Will Be Subject to Appropriate Punishment</p>
<p>A female body was found on the beach behind the Ruiyong Shipyard in Yangshupu. The Provisional Court has conducted an autopsy, and the police have found the woman's father, Ding Huibiao, and brought him to the court. According to Ding's confession, his daughter, Ding Xiaoliuzi, actually died of illness. Because he had no money to buy a coffin, he abandoned the body in the Huangpu River. The police requested that Ding Huibiao be detained for autopsy and re-verification because there were no external injuries on Ding's daughter's body, but there might be other internal reasons. It is now known that Ding's body has been clearly identified by a Western doctor as having died of illness. The police were notified. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the police escorted Ding Huibiao to the autopsy site. Judge Sun Yuan took his seat. The Western deputy police chief of Yangshupu Police Station complained about the situation and submitted the Western doctor's autopsy report. After Judge Sun looked at it, he said that although Ding's daughter had been verified to have died of illness, her father had abandoned the body in the Huangpu River and should be given appropriate punishment. He ordered Ding Huibiao to be taken back to the police station to await trial by the court.</p>

<p>Eleven People Resembling Bandits</p>
<p>Villagers Sounded the Alarm, Company Commander Led Them Away</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM the night before last, eleven people resembling bandits, without weapons, suddenly came to the tea garden opened by Shen Zhusheng in the Niqiangquan area of Pudong. Under the pretext of searching for arms, they stole 5 yuan in silver dollars from the tea customer Li Maomao, a silver watch and 1 yuan in silver dollars and 10 jiao in small silver dollars from Wang Qiansheng, a steel watch and 6 jiao in small silver dollars from Zhang Ahu, 1 yuan in silver dollars from Yang Heshang, and 6 copper coins from Pan Ahu. Because Pan was very poor and did not accept it, he tried to resist, and was beaten by these people with wooden sticks and broke his right leg. The villagers nearby sounded the alarm, and the police from the Third Division of the Third District were dispatched to the scene and arrested three people. They were taken back to the station and sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Notorious Bandit Ordered to Be Brought Back for Trial</p>
<p>Zhuang Dianchen, a native of Tongzhou, gathered a group of armed people in his hometown on January 17 this year to rob the property of the Li family, and committed murder and arson. After the case was exposed, he fled to Shanghai and hid in the Fuxing Noodle Restaurant at 1242 Huade Road. He was arrested by Detective Wang Changgen of the Huishan Police and handed over to the Provisional Court. An order was given to detain him pending the official document from the local authorities to transfer him for further investigation. Now, Lang Shiying, the leader of the detective team of the Tongzhou Public Security Bureau, has arrived in Shanghai with the document. Yesterday morning, he petitioned the court to transfer him. Judge Xu reviewed the case of the bandit Zhuang, interrogated him briefly, and handed him over to the team leader to be taken back for trial.</p>

<p>Zhang Ganquan, a detective from the Suzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and reported to the French Police that the bandit Ge Yintian instigated his accomplice Wei Zihe to rob a large sum of money from a wood shop in Suzhou on the 19th of this month. Wei Zihe was arrested on the spot and confessed that Ge Yintian was hiding in Tianxiang Lane, Beile Road, under the jurisdiction. Therefore, he came to Shanghai to report and request assistance in the arrest and investigation. The police chief approved the request and immediately ordered the detectives to go to the address to arrest Ge. He was taken to the police station and sent to the French Court for trial yesterday. First, the visiting detective stated the case and requested permission to transfer him back to the district for trial. Ge Yintian replied, "I came to Shanghai last year and lived in Tianxiang Lane. I have never left Shanghai. How can I commit a crime? Please investigate." The Chinese and Western officials ordered him to be detained pending investigation before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e190">Unnamed Soldier's Corpse Outside the Jiangwan Station <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Abdomen Broken, Intestines Visible</p>
<p>Fresh Blood Everywhere</p>
<p>Horrible to Behold</p>
<p>At about 6:00 AM yesterday morning, a soldier was found murdered in a small ditch next to the track near the Yangqi Terrace west of the Jiangwan Station on the Songhu Railway. The military cap fell about three feet away from the body. The body was facing up, with its back to the ground. The buttons of the military uniform were completely loose. There was a wound about a foot long between the chest and abdomen, as if it had been cut open with a knife, so the internal organs in the abdomen were visible. There was fresh blood on the military uniform and trousers, which was horrible to behold. Considering the time of the incident, it must have been late at night the night before last. What is strange is that there was no insignia hanging on the soldier's military uniform, and no objects were left behind. Generally, they have all been destroyed by the murderer, so it is impossible to know his unit and name for a while. After the discovery, it was reported to the camp of the 29th Regiment stationed at the Relief Home for Women and Children and the nearby police station. Now, both the military and police have sent detectives to hunt down the murderer. It is still difficult to understand the truth.</p>

<p>Election of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The Dahua Leather Factory, with a capital of 300,000 yuan, has been established for two years and is quite substantial. The leather produced is of excellent quality. The Ministry of Finance, in order to encourage the factory's operations and promote Chinese industry, has approved tax exemption for its products. Therefore, the price of its leather is lower than that of other companies, and its business is thriving. The founders are Zheng Hongnian, Ye Wangsheng, Mao Heyuan, Shen Shouyun, Zhu Jiliang, and other prominent Shanghai businessmen. The factory held its second shareholders' meeting at the Ningbo Fellow Provincial Association the other day to elect directors and supervisors. The election results were as follows: Zheng Hongnian, Zhu Jiliang, Shen Shouyun, Mao Heyuan, Ye Wangsheng, Lin Xisheng, and Yu Jingshan were elected as directors. Gao Shizhi and Yuan Yunbiao were elected as alternate directors. Li Zunan and Wu Zemin were elected as supervisors, and Ye Hongying and Lin Xingshu were elected as alternate supervisors. Furthermore, the original manager of the factory, Zeng Guangzhi, resigned and left. The board of directors then elected Director Mao Heyuan to concurrently serve as manager, managing all internal and external affairs of the factory. Mr. Mao has extensive qualifications and rich experience, and it is expected that the factory's business will definitely improve in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Streetlights on Jiaotong Road near the Sun Temple <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities is Planning</p>
<p>The area west of the Sun Temple on Jiaotong Road in this city has not been equipped with streetlights, and it is extremely dark at night. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities had previously instructed the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to lay electric poles and lines for installation. However, telegraph poles and telephone poles had already been planted on both sides of that section of the road. Therefore, when the company began planting poles, the First District Engineering Branch of the Shanghai-Hankou Telegraph Pole Line of the Ministry of Communications, fearing that the induced current would be too strong and would hinder telegraph communication in the future, requested a change of route. Upon receiving the report, the bureau immediately sent personnel to conduct a site survey and found that the south side of the road was owned by the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. If the telegraph poles and lines were transplanted within the railway boundary, freeing up the original location for planting electric poles and lines, there would be no hindrance to either party. The cost of moving the poles could be borne by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. The Engineering Branch agreed immediately. Subsequently, when the bureau negotiated with the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Administration to borrow land for planting poles, it did not get approval. Considering that the electricity supply and streetlight equipment in the area were urgently needed, the bureau specifically petitioned the municipal government to consult the Ministry of Communications, instructing the telegraph engineering authorities to transplant the telegraph poles on that section of the road to the north side, parallel to the telephone poles, or instructing the telephone authorities to transplant the telephone poles to the south side, parallel to the telegraph poles, in order to free up any side of the road for laying electric poles and lines and installing streetlights.</p>

<p>Near Tanzi Port</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Coal Industry Association stating that a section of the harbor near the Yanshengtang in Tanzi Port was being blocked by small Jiangbei boats and other miscellaneous empty boats, completely obstructing the waterway. All incoming and outgoing boats were unable to pass, and heavily loaded coal boats had been blocked for four days and nights, unable to leave. The letter requested that the Chamber of Commerce quickly find a way to resolve this issue. After investigation, the Chamber found that the obstruction of waterways by small boats and empty boats in Tanzi Port was indeed preventing coal barges from passing, which hindered the use of fuel by factories and the business of coal shops. The Chamber of Commerce, therefore, wrote to the Zhabei Water Patrol Team, requesting that they instruct police officers to clear and dredge the waterways near the Yanshengtang in Tanzi Port at any time, in order to facilitate the transport of coal.</p>

<p>Ms. Yan Vows to Die Rather Than Marry Li Xiangsheng</p>
<p>Li Xiangsheng, a native of Funing working as a dispatcher in the Second Brigade of the Anti-Smuggling Camp, lacked a wife. Through the matchmaking of friends Chen Fengxiang and Zuo Tuhong, he married Ms. Yan (also known as Ah Si), a widow from Yancheng. A marriage contract was signed on the spot, and betrothal gifts were handed over. However, shortly after Ms. Yan entered his house, she fled with some belongings. Li Xiangsheng urgently searched for her and eventually received a tip that she had been found at the home of a Taizhou woman, Shen Shi, at No. 954 North Chengdu Road in the Public Concession. He arrested her and Shen Shi and took them to the Southern District, filing a complaint with the First District First Precinct. They were ordered to be temporarily detained separately. Yesterday, during the preliminary hearing by the precinct chief, the plaintiff, Li Xiangsheng, recounted the events and requested punishment. Ms. Yan testified that her husband's name was Shen Xiechun, and he had been falsely accused in a theft case in the previous year, leading to his arrest and a five-year prison sentence. After the incident, she moved to No. 8, Lane 4, Xinkangli, Datong Road, Xinzha. In December of last year, a neighboring woman, Ms. Shi, brought her to Li's house. It was already late, and she stayed at Li's house. The next day, Zuo Shihong and others, who knew Ms. Shi, took her to a tea house, where they forcibly pressed her finger onto the marriage contract. Afterwards, she was forced to return to Li's house with him. All of the 100 yuan in betrothal money was taken away by the matchmakers, Zuo Shihong and others. After arriving at Li's house, she found that Li was violent and often mistreated her. Unable to endure the suffering, she took advantage of an opportunity to fetch water on the second day of this month and sneaked out to stay at Shen Shi's house. Even though she has been found by Li, she vows to die rather than return to Li's house. The precinct chief, noting that the testimonies of the two parties differed and that the case involved criminal accusations, ordered the case to be transferred to the Shanghai District Court for further investigation.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the Editor: According to a letter from Huang Bingnan, owner of the Nanchang Umbrella Factory and a member of our association, upon reading the 工会消息 column in yesterday's *Shen Bao*, the resolutions of the Shanghai Umbrella Industry Workers' Conference included that the Nanchang factory does not pay wages to workers and that worker Hu Zixiang was beaten and executive committee member Wu Hanfang was stabbed. Our factory's work is contracted by foreman Sun Shoushen, and the workers used are also hired by the foreman. All wages are paid to the foreman on a monthly basis without any deduction. As for the beating of worker Hu Zixiang and the stabbing of executive committee member Wu Hanfang, it is even more absurd. Not only is there no such fact, but it is unheard of. We, therefore, specially request your association to forward a letter to the *Shen Bao* to make a correction. The association immediately sent personnel to the factory to investigate and confirmed the facts. We hereby request your newspaper to include this letter in the Letter to the Editor column for correction. Sincerely, the Umbrella Industry Branch of the Chamber of Commerce, February 24.</p>

<p>Eunuch Sanbao in Nanyang YS</p>
<p>(V) Fasting Festival</p>
<p>Every year around February or March in the Western calendar, at around 6:30 PM, we hear the sound of drums from the mosque. This drum sound tells the Malays that it is time to eat. At four o'clock in the deep night, the drum sound from the mosque warns the Malays that it is time to fast. If you do not understand the truth, you might find it strange. But this is a custom of the Malays, called the Fasting Festival (Poesa). The Fasting Festival begins in the twelfth month of the Islamic calendar and lasts until New Year's Day.</p>
<p>The Fasting Festival is like this: from morning to evening, eating and drinking are strictly forbidden. At 6:30 PM in the evening, after the mosque's drum sounds, a starving Malay can start eating, but rice cannot be eaten yet. Rice can only be eaten at midnight. Then, at three or four in the morning, another meal is eaten, and then they must endure hunger until the evening of the next day. If someone does not follow this rule or cannot bear the burning hunger and secretly eats, it is said that this person will be punished by the prophet Muhammad. Seeing this strange custom, readers may be eager for me to tell its origin. Okay, listen quietly. I begin like this:</p>
<p>In 1405, a group of lazy and barbaric Malay people in the Nanyang region first saw the traces of the Eunuch Sanbao sent by the Great Ming Dynasty. Because of the Malays' own weakness, they regarded the Eunuch Sanbao sent by the Great Ming Dynasty as an angel. Moreover, since Sanbao arrived in Nanyang, they received many favors from him, so they welcomed him very much. The Malays often called Eunuch Sanbao "Grandpa Sanbao," "Lord Sanbao," and "Duke Sanbao." The chief often treated him with hospitality. However, Sanbao, harboring the idea of ​​wiping out the Malay people, often thought of bloodless ways to kill them and eliminate a group of foolish people. So, he came up with a method. This method was to starve all the Malays to death.</p>
<p>One day, at the beginning of December in the Islamic calendar, Sanbao began to use his extermination method.</p>
<p>(Last night, I dreamed of the Heavenly Emperor. He instructed me and your people to fast for a month before the New Year. If anyone eats even a little, then this family will suffer the disaster of starving to death in two years. This disaster is its punishment, because the punishment of the Heavenly Emperor is evidence that people should believe, otherwise, you will think I am lying.)</p>
<p>After Sanbao told the chieftain these words, the Malay people dared not disobey and followed them respectfully. However, Sanbao also had to endure hunger like them.</p>
<p>After a few days, Sanbao himself felt that he could not bear it anymore. So, one night, he began to secretly eat things. Once, he was inadvertently glimpsed by a Malay while secretly eating.</p>
<p>(Grandpa Sanbao, didn't you say that the Heavenly Emperor had instructed us to fast during the month of December? Why are you eating things yourself?) The Malay asked.</p>
<p>At this time, he was really a little anxious, but the clever him immediately thought of something and said,</p>
<p>(Yes, I did say that to you. However, I did not eat because I could not bear the hunger. Every night in December, when the stars come out, we can still eat something.)</p>
<p>After hearing this, the Malay began to eat. Soon, everyone followed suit. However, Sanbao's method failed again. Since then, there has been an additional Fasting Festival in the Islamic calendar.</p>

<p>(II) Teahouses and Restaurants</p>
<p>People passing by Nanjing Road outside the concession can see at least one or a few pairs of fair-skinned, upright Westerners sipping coffee and pouring milk in the glass windows along the road of the Huizhong Hotel. Especially in the afternoon, you can see (waiters) wearing spotless uniforms, holding silver trays, serving the guests back and forth. In fact, people who have been to coffee shops and eaten Western food are not surprised by this scene. The only difference is that the same tea, when made by Westerners, must be mixed with milk, sugar, stirred with a teaspoon, and placed on a sugar-clamped saucer. The various procedures are really tedious, as if嫌 the tea in the teapot is too little, not enough to drink freely, and they must use various methods to prolong their (afternoon tea) time.</p>
<p>Arriving at Tongyuchun or Rishenglou, the tea is still the same tea, but the way of drinking is very different. There is no fixed uniform for the waiters. It seems that one tea guest can occupy several seats. Everyone is casual. Although there is no music in the teahouse, the (symphony) played jointly by the guests is ten thousand times more complex than the music in the City Hall. The sound of teapots and teacups colliding has a (deep metallic sound), and the sound of spitting phlegm is mixed with the wonderful harmony of coughing. When the tea master comes to add boiling water, the long-necked spout of the copper kettle is at least a foot above the mouth of the teapot. The boiling water from the spout to the mouth of the pot is bright and crystal clear, like a silver chain, like a waterfall. As for drinking tea, it always involves a (talking) element. Except when the tea is moistening the throat, there is simply no time to stop talking. Sitting in the teahouse is like putting your head in a radio broadcasting machine. There is great value in studying tea drinking and life. Eating and life, of course, need no further explanation. Generally, there is always a teahouse on every major street, and there is always a restaurant at the corner of every two streets. (Restaurant), what a magnificent name! Dahua Restaurant, Cathay Hotel, Astor House Hotel… there are many hotels. No, the restaurant mentioned here is similar to the teahouse above, and is not a hotel where you can stay. Some people say that you don't need to open your eyes to find a restaurant, because there is always a special oily smell in the restaurant that rushes straight to the nostrils, appetizing and refreshing. It is true that the oily smell in the restaurant serves as a guide. Who knows that the (natural signboard) of the restaurant is more interesting and worthy of study than any other store.</p>
<p>The position of the stove in a small restaurant is often disproportionate to its entrance, and the size ratio is not appropriate. Not to mention the larger ones. Moreover, the position of the stove is never hidden inside. As soon as the guests enter the restaurant, they see the most important thing (rice). So, at twelve o'clock noon, the rice in the pot is piled up like a small mountain. (Seeing the mountain upon opening the door) can be given as a gift to the restaurant. As for the dishes, they are particularly eye-catching. The dishes in many restaurants are always stacked along the glass windows. People walking outside see a huge oil painting mural displayed in front of them, with bright oil and rich colors. People with weak stomachs cannot help but avoid it. There are also whole pieces of meat and whole chickens stacked on top of other small dishes, with a great air of overwhelming the rest. Hungry people walking past the window, that chicken instantly gets into their stomach, their throat feels unnatural, and their toes are crooked inward. The function of (natural signboard) is like this.</p>
<p>How many teahouses and restaurants are there in Shanghai? Judging from a small statistic, the number must be astonishing. This statistic was compiled by the Zhabei Public Security Bureau. It is very interesting and valuable. The outline is like this: on fifty-two roads, there are a total of two hundred and nineteen teahouses, averaging four teahouses on each street. On fifteen roads, there are eighty-three restaurants, including beef and mutton noodle restaurants, etc. Therefore, on average, there are five restaurants or similar places to eat on each street. From these two points, the number of teahouses and restaurants is almost equal on each street. In other words, the residents' need for teahouses and restaurants is in the same position. To put it the other way around, there is a restaurant wherever there is a teahouse, or there must be a restaurant attached to a teahouse. Tea and meals, tea and meals, are truly inseparable terms.</p>
<p>Among the fifty-two roads mentioned above, one street is relatively the longest, so speaking of restaurants alone, there are thirty-two, and there are twenty-six teahouses. Adding the two together, aren't there as many as sixty-eight? The residents' eagerness for them can be imagined. Among the two hundred and nineteen teahouses, the largest capital is eight thousand coins, and the smallest is only ten yuan. The largest capital of the restaurant is five thousand yuan, and the smallest is twenty-six yuan. This is probably an approximate number, because no matter how simple it is, it is probably not easy to open a small tiger stove-style teahouse with a capital of ten yuan. Among them, the longest-running has been open for seventeen years, and the shortest has only been open for one year. A relatively complete teahouse has an accounting room, a waiter, a stove operator, etc. The simplest only has one boss, who mediates between the two and runs errands. The so-called ten yuan capital is probably like this.</p>
<p>If we further compile statistics, the interest will naturally be further enriched. For example, how many tea guests are there in each teahouse every day? How many of these guests are regulars? What are their lives like? What are the most needed dishes in the restaurant? The number of people, the rice and vegetables, etc., must all be related. In addition, the statistics of rice buckets in each restaurant, the age of the rice buckets, etc., are also very interesting. Generally speaking, the position of the restaurant is always a little more advantageous than the teahouse, but the need for the teahouse is more important than the restaurant. The former is to fill the stomach, the latter is to adjust the dry life, and there are many people who use it to kill (limited life). Among the two hundred and nineteen teahouses mentioned above, one is called (Mixed One) Heaven One. This really speaks out the psychology of the tea guests.</p>

<p>Urban Life of American Women</p>
<p>Deep branches, shallow branches, deep and shallow branches side by side, the branches are hard to compare to her.</p>
<p>Jade-like skin, willow-like eyebrows, loving the golden-threaded goose yellow clothes. For whom is the tearful makeup?</p>
<p>| | Longing | |</p>
<p>Mr. Mishue Shi, a reporter for the Peiping News, and her husband,</p>
<p>Wang Yizhi, said in his travel memoirs, "America is a paradise for women." This allows us to glimpse that the lives of American women are very comfortable. Not only is there a world of difference between their lives and those of Chinese women, but even the lives of women in England, France, Germany, and Italy seem to be on different levels compared to them. Therefore, some people jokingly say that American women, especially those in cities, live on the foreheads of men. Although this statement is somewhat excessive, it must be recognized as a vivid portrayal.</p>
<p>American women, especially those in cities, are almost all loyal followers of Mammonism. Therefore, they sometimes openly and explicitly carry out their activities with the mission of Mammonism. Indeed, what is called social interaction is simply Mammonistic social interaction, and what is called love is simply Mammonistic love. According to American Jars, (In the United States in the last twenty years, there have been no fewer than four million divorce cases in total. More than 90% of the reasons for divorce are due to the mentality of women (seeing one mountain higher than another, anyone can be a husband, which can be said to be the general fashion of American women today.) There is a very popular saying in New York, namely "your money that will open all doors to you." The meaning of this fallacy is that as long as you have money, you can do anything. American women seem to regard it as a golden rule. A charming and beautiful young woman is willing to be the lifelong companion of two old men. It is not known what the reason is, but it can be said that it is simply driven by Mammonism.</p>
<p>American women in cities, whether married or not, have only one job: to work hard in social interactions. If people with old-fashioned minds or conservative viewpoints in our country were to see them, they would definitely criticize them sarcastically as prostitutes and harlots. However, Americans do not feel that there is anything wrong with it. However, the social skills of American women in cities are indeed beyond the reach of women in our country. The first thing is dancing skills. In their daily lives, it seems that dancing must be included and regarded as an indispensable lesson. It seems that if they don't dance for a day, they feel that an important task of the day has not been completed. From the perspective of the current American women's psychology, dancing is seen as the sweetest form of life. Usually, they may wait for their husbands to go to the dance hall together after work, but sometimes they dance with other men, and even refuse their husbands to join. The second thing is eating candy. Dr. Martin, who has been preaching in China for a long time, once told me a story about American women liking to eat candy. He said that in a small town less than thirty miles from Hitch, there was a family whose husband worked as a repairman in a car factory in Hitch. His wife asked George for money to pay for his son's tuition, but she bought a lot of candy from George and ate it all the way back. When her husband came home and asked about paying the tuition, she was speechless and could not answer. As a result, an unfortunate divorce occurred. We can dare to say that this kind of thing exists in the United States. Furthermore, according to people who have traveled back from the United States, American women always have candy in their mouths, whether they are watching a play, having fun, taking a walk in the countryside, or staying at home. Especially in social occasions, they refuse to leave this "gentleman," showing that they like to live</p>

<p>a sweet life and express their sweet love. American women in cities like fashion no less than Parisian women. In the past, there was a joke in Paris that a woman wanted her husband to buy her the most fashionable hat. Her husband went to the market to pick one, and rushed to offer it to her, hoping to please the beauty. Who knew that by the time he bought it, she said that the hat was no longer fashionable, because in that short period of time, she had already seen a hat that was even more fashionable than this one. In fact, the psychology of American women in cities wanting to be fashionable is even more intense now. Husbands have no choice but to surrender to the pomegranate skirt, not daring to say no. They want whatever they want. Therefore, women in the upper class of America always have dozens, or even more than a hundred, hats prepared. Regarding this point, Mr. Xu Zhengkeng's "Records of American Customs" can prove it.</p>
<p>Also, American women in cities generally have a diamond obsession. They regard diamonds as ornaments of unparalleled glory. American women consider diamonds to be indispensable, just like British women's love of tea. American women originally worship money, so some people say that diamonds can be exchanged for women's love, just like the effect of a magnet on iron. The most fashionable women in American cities not only have diamonds on their hats, diamonds inlaid on their jewelry, but even diamonds inlaid on their dresses and even their shoes. No wonder that since 1920, the value of diamond imports alone in the United States has been about 90 million yuan each year. There are many specialized diamond shops in the prosperous cities of New York, Chicago, St. Louis, and Boston. American women in cities compete for charm (Charming)</p>
<p>and beauty (Smart). Their clothes are constantly changing all the time, and the colors of their clothes are also constantly changing. Many women, in order to be fashionable, use the same color of clothing from head to toe, even down to a shoe buckle, a ring, and a handkerchief, which must also be the same color. In this way, they finally feel charming and beautiful. Because they demand charm and beauty everywhere, the consumption of ornaments is very large. According to recent customs statistics in the United States, the item of powder used by women is no less than 50 to 60 million yuan, and the same goes for perfume. This is only in terms of imports from foreign countries. If we add up what they manufacture in their own country, it would be even more amazing. Finally, let me say a few words. The lives of American women in cities are probably more comfortable than in any other country. But what is the reason for creating this situation of women standing on men's heads? That still needs to be asked of the general men of America. However, although American women are so respected, privileged, and extravagant, most of them have occupations and are educated, which is much better than in our country. Then, taking the good and discarding the bad is what we hope for the women's world.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Mrs. Whitney Art Museum in Changxi <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of art museums in the United States recently has been remarkably active. In addition to city and national ones, those established by private donations or in memory of a certain person are even more enthusiastic than in other countries. People with even a slight appreciation for art are happy to sacrifice money to make this kind of permanent memorial. Therefore, there was the Rodin Art Museum of the great French sculptor Rodin, and this year there will soon be the Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney Art Museum. Originally, there were very few art museums in New York. In addition to the Museum of Modern Art, which opened last winter, the Mrs. Whitney Art Museum, which will open this winter, can be regarded as a sister flower. In the past twenty years, Mrs. Whitney has enthusiastically supported and excited the art movement within the scope of possibility. This art museum was donated by Mrs. Whitney personally and it was decided to convert Mrs. Whitney's original studio exhibition into a large-scale art museum, in which it was decided to focus specifically on the collection and display of modern American art, with other countries taking a secondary position.</p>
<p>Her enthusiastic support for art has attracted national attention, because most women engaged in art do not have a large organization, but are merely a kind of private and weak research. Therefore, after the people of the whole country were disappointed with the Joint Exhibition of American Female Artists, Mrs. Whitney's grand event was even more regarded as the first time that women in China had shown their talents in the art world.</p>
