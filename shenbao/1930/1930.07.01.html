<h3 id="c114">遠征歐美之動機 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>該隊領隊余衡之嘗謂華人遠征歐美之動機遠在四年之前當時本人已抱此理想逐年培養樂華人才提高程度至今時機成熟成爲實事私心竊爲安慰然而遠東會中日打成平數之恥羞亦使余不得不下一决心以爲他年發揚國威之準備也</p>

<p>此次華人遠征足球隊係樂華體育會所組織關於挑選球員極爲審愼須先經該會董事之挑擇後方由該會分别接洽其目標在抱負優越之球藝之外尙須有善良之品性蓋此次遠征目的固在增進球藝提高程度實則不啻爲中國新青年之代表在在須表演大國民之精神也</p>

<p>遠征軍經費已得熱心體育者之贊助似不成問題萬一不足將於爪哇比賽時設法籌劃之至贊助之數因捐助者不欲宣揚故領隊余衡之亦不便爲之宣佈至前次南征多餘之六千餘元去年已用去五千餘元所存不多又上届足球季內該隊僅得恊進會四百元車費其餘均由該隊補添故費用甚巨云</p>

<p>季平　　從心理學上我們可以看到青年期是人生一個最激越的時代因爲不但在生理的結構上有着顯著的長育而且心理的　　畫家龎薰琴之作品（徐蔚南攝）　　特性更有飛躍的發展這時的感情已不若以前的偏於感覺易於消滅和限於眼前的範圍瑣細的事情而已因着接觸的世界的擴大和知識的開展感情易於持久並要求有具體的表現這種要求反映在實際上便是愛情的抬頭和社會事業的注意同時文藝的愛好尤爲這時期一個普遍而有力的傾向因爲文藝原來只是感情的組織化富於感情的青年自然只有這個途徑是最適合了我們看各國的文學史多少的文學家差不多没有一個不是從青年時代努力起的並且有的就在青年時代成了名這一個事實說明了什麽呢那就是青年與文藝的結合决不是偶然而有着强烈的心理的基礎　　同時在另一方面還具有社會的意義我們知道文藝是文化的一部分而文化是民族的産物青年是具有創造能力的羣是時代的先驅是民族的主力因此在普及和提高文化換句話說在發揚民族的光輝這一意義上青年是必然地賦有了這個使命而文藝工作的從事也就是這個使命的實踐總之青年與文藝是應該成爲一種目的性的結合即是一面根據着內在的藝術的要求同時不站在個人的立場而以民族文化爲前提的意識的行動　　中國青年在着過去的年間是與其他的人一様的呻吟在專制之下幾失了其青年應有的特性文藝是被人遺忘了的一般的所謂士子只在盤旋着升官的幻想這是客觀的歷史條件决定了他我們是不用責的但是辛亥革命以後繼着産生了轟烈烈的「五四」運動這一個運動由着以政治爲對象演進到以文化爲對象而文化運動主要尤傾注在文學革命本來這一個運動是由青年學生所造成至此一般的青年也就與文藝深切地結合起來了我們從那時的作品上和其他的一切上都可以見到青年對於文藝有着瘋狂般的熱情這熱情是打下了新文藝的一般的基礎此後「五四」運動隨着社會的演進起了水少的分化青年在文藝上的努力也成了幾個力向各以其本身所隸的文藝集團互爲標榜及至國民革命軍出師北伐軍事勢力到逹長江的時候浸潤在文藝領域的青年有不少跑入了軍隊文藝走入了沉寂的時期這個時期没有多久接着政治上的變動文藝又起了急劇的分野十七年春的文壇論戰便是具體的表現而以後青年的對於文藝也便在理論上起了苦悶迄於今日有不少的青年是走入了迷津這在民族文化上呈了一個不良的症候過去青年在着文藝上有相當的努力這是不可否認的但是他的錯誤也確實不少第一我們從文藝本身上看一般的青年對於文藝的要求是唯美享樂因此感情的個人的氣分十分濃厚而忘却上時代性社會化等要素他們認文藝是一種天才的火花所以只在抓掇片段的印象搜求所謂「靈感」從不肯有深湛的修養及至最近雖然「藝術之宫」是撤守了但換來的是硬生生的社會科學的理論作成了被動的傳聲的喇叭對於文藝的錯誤見解實際還和以前一様第二我們徑從事文藝的熊度上看有不少的青年從事文藝工作不是無所容心目的在消遣便是甘心爲特殊的工具同時更有不少的青年把從事文藝作爲一種「敲門磚」當其未得其門而入對於文藝是很努力的然而一旦偶像造成有了其他重要位置之後便把文藝棄如敝屣或竟還未成名見異思遷捨之他去　　仰窺（張亦庵攝）　　歸結是總不能把文藝當做終身的事業這些都是過去明顯的現象然而是不好的錯誤的現象是有害於民族文化的現象　　我們考察上述的錯誤可以得到一個共通的地方便是没有把文藝看成關於民族文化的東西惟其如此所以在第一只把文藝看成兩個絕端不是個人的便是階級的因此也不肯意識地去修養在第二也是無關宏旨地只在狹隘處着想而不認做神聖的精神事業這兩個錯誤如不校正過來非但是文壇没落的二豎而且是民族文化的要害但是怎様校正過來呢這一個題從上述中已可見到一些便是應該首先確定對於文藝的中心意識而這一個中心意識無疑地是民族意識換句話說就是以民族文化爲立塲我們知道在那遙遠的歷史的開頭藝術不是從個人的意識裏産生而是從民族的立塲所形成的生活意識裏産生的文藝的重大使命是在發揮他所屬的民族精神和意識同時只有民族文化的最高表現的文藝的發展才能使民族的生活向上精神提高和社社進步中國民族現在是受了種種壓迫而國內的文壇則正在向那畸形發展危機四伏的道上走所以在今日文藝上民族意識的確立是絕對地必要愛好文藝的青年們從你們對於文藝理論的苦悶中解放出來罷認清你們當前的任務這當前的任務是民族意識的肯定來積極地發揮民族的力量創造民族的新的生命</p>

<p>提出這個問題來討論也許有人要笑我無聊可是本問題與青年本身和民族前途都有密切關係我們能加以討論實在比任可問題來得有意義　　有的人說青年求學爲的是自已青年要在社會得一立足地要找得一條自已的出路要解决本身的一切問題都非求學不可於是做着甜蜜的戀愛之夢的朋友們也得求學以謀解决他的戀愛問題不滿意於現狀的朋友們也得求學以企求他未來的黄金時代社會上没有地位仰人鼻息的朋友們也得入學以圖得到特殊地位滿足他的支配慾窮無出路的朋友們不待說也得入學未來的升官發財出路正多着呢老實說那一個青年他的求學不是爲着一已之私呢可是這様極端的個人主義的求學自私自利的結果於民族前途的發展大有阻害同時青年本身也屬利益少損多　　有的人說青年求學爲的是社會社會上留待青年來解决的問題實在太多了青年的求學爲欲以學問爲解决社會問題的工具誰能說他不是呢於是信仰社會主義的青年都得入學他們儘可穿着西裝吃着大菜坐自動車逛跳舞塲而談他的階級鬥爭上咖啡館開大旅館坐電風扇下而做普羅文學這様極端的社會主義的求學結果是爲社會宣告死刑爲本人拕掘墳墓罷了　　末了我們應主張青年求學爲的是民族我們是一個被壓迫的民族要從被壓迫的地位得到自由平等的地位這重大的使命已落在我們的肩上我們是爲着挽救中華民族之危亡才求學的我們是爲着圖謀中華民族之發展才求學的我們學自然科學的青年應努力於物質文明之發展以解决民族之衣食住行四大問題學社社科學的青年應努力於政法實用的學問以謀民族團體組織的健全和共同生活的改進學文藝的青年應努力於民族主義的文藝運動積極的以喚起民族意識發揚民族精神總括說句話我們求學决不爲一已之私决不爲社會的某一階級也决不爲狹義的國家觀念我們求學爲的是要替整個民族謀利益找出路以求逹到自由平等之目的親愛</p>

<h3 id="e6">Relief Financial Policy <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>In the past, so-called strong and powerful governments were not afraid of the constraints of parliament and made arbitrary decisions whenever faced with difficult problems. Today, however, no country dares to make arbitrary decisions regarding relief financial policies. Why? Because the advantages and disadvantages of the matter are very complex, and the situation is extremely difficult. They are勉籌, making efforts to come up with countermeasures in a situation where there is absolutely no solution, and they dare not be confident about the impact on the facts in the future. In addition to dissolving parliament, the German constitution also has Article 48, which stipulates that when public safety and order are obviously hindered and in danger, full power may be exercised. In other words, it can be implemented in the form of emergency orders without the consent of parliament. The previous cabinet Muller had this extraordinary power but dared not use it, rather he was opposed by parliament for its financial policy and collapsed. The current Brüning cabinet, although mentioning Article 48 of the constitution and the threat of dissolving parliament every time it spoke about the new financial policy, did not dare to try it lightly. This is because the financial problem is a factual problem. There is no way to develop financial resources, and it is impossible to delay relief to unemployed industry and commerce. The positive policy is strongly opposed, and the austerity policy is criticized, and it is not certain what kind of policy is beneficial at present. Now, if one comes out with arbitrary decisions, even the slightest impropriety will greatly harm the country, so this financial problem is not a problem of power.  However, if this financial policy cannot be resolved by power, then it can only be held between the two sides of support and opposition and fall into a stalemate. If you accommodate Party A, then Party B attacks; if you accommodate Party B, then Party C and Party D attack. If the financial policy of the 甲阁 cannot be passed in the parliament, then the 甲 government collapses. If the financial policy of the 乙阁 cannot be passed in the parliament, then the 乙 government collapses. Although the government has fallen one after another, the financial relief is still not possible. Is this a good phenomenon in the world? Domestic Important Telegrams Two</p>

<h3 id="e7">He Chengjun's Proposal <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Hankou: He Chengjun telegraphed the provincial government from Zhumadian on the 29th with the following proposals: (1) In view of the military emergency and financial difficulties, all agencies within the scope of the provincial government can only reduce their budgets during this period and cannot add to them. Party fees must not exceed the scope set by the central government. (2) All new agencies that have been planned but not yet established will be postponed until after the end of military operations. (3) The保安團 will temporarily train only the number of people who have been recruited. Those who are insufficient will be recruited after the end of military operations. (4) The heads of each district must focus on maintaining local security and must not recruit士匪 or use the name to appropriate civilian团枪, thereby reducing the local self-defense capacity. Violators will be severely punished. (5) The Water Public Security Bureau case may be established, but it must wait until after the end of military operations. (6) In the future, the appointment of局长, 路局长, 校长, county magistrates, and section chiefs of the provincial government will require the submission of their resumes to the committee for approval before they can be appointed. Otherwise, the provincial government will cancel the order. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e67">Opposition to Naval Treaty <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Johnson and Three Others Sign Name, Criticizing British Prime Minister's Remarks to America.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, June 30th: Senator Johnson today released a long, 10,000-word statement opposing the London Naval Treaty. The statement, signed by Johnson and three others, criticizes British Prime Minister MacDonald for telling President Hoover that he would allow the United States to build a new super battleship. It also stated that even if Britain had to dismantle five warships, with the US and Japan each dismantling one, the US naval power would still be inferior to Britain because Britain has two large battleships built after the Battle of Jutland. Although the numerical inequality is about to be eliminated, calculating Britain's tonnage is approximately 25,000 tons more than the United States, equivalent to one more battleship. The statement also lists various points of opposition, such as: the treaty requires the abandonment of the United States' old naval policy; the treaty cannot protect American commerce; the treaty invalidates the 5:5:3 ratio; the treaty fails to put the US and Britain on equal footing; the treaty unnecessarily increases Japan's ratio and endangers the United States' position in the Pacific.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, June 29th: Based on current indications, the London Naval Treaty may not be ratified during the special session of the Senate in July. Therefore, it is expected that President Hoover will urge the people of the country to put pressure on their representatives to pass it. Today, people close to the government know that President Hoover views the early passage of this treaty as crucial in both diplomatic and domestic standpoints. If it is delayed, there will be more complications, and the number of opponents will definitely increase. When the Naval Affairs Committee solicited the opinions of naval officers on this treaty, there were more than ten opponents. The three points they opposed the most were: (1) This treaty cannot make the United States and Britain equal. (2) This treaty forces the United States to use cruisers equipped with 6-inch caliber guns, a type of cruiser that the United States does not particularly need. (3) This treaty increases the ratio of Japanese battleships and auxiliary ships, which violates the principles established by the Washington Treaty and is detrimental to the United States.</p>

The country today anticipates the need to convene an international conference to stabilize silver prices in the future. Various mines are still suspending operations due to excessive stockpiles and have already dismissed 4,000 miners.

<p>National News Agency, Chicago, June 29th: The Merlin brothers, co-piloting the aircraft "Chicago," remained airborne for 421 hours, 21 minutes, and 30 seconds as of 6:01 AM this morning, setting a new record for endurance flight. While the aircraft was in the air, another aircraft regularly supplied gasoline using a rubber hose, and Merlin's sister provided meals. The aircraft suddenly developed a leak in the oil pipe a few days ago, requiring frequent refueling, but the Merlin brothers still hope to hold out until July 4th. The Merlin brothers will receive a reward of $200,000 from gasoline, radio, and aircraft companies for this success, which the companies are using for advertising.

<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, June 30th: The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has received a detailed report on the incident of the "Harumi Maru" arresting Soviet Russian observers. A meeting was held to decide to instruct [the captain] to obtain a confession from the captured Soviet Russian prisoners, and at the same time, the Ministry of the Navy instructed the destroyer "Kihagi" to draw up a confession and then release them. If this is done, the solution to the incident will not add to the confusion and can maintain the peace of Japanese-Russian relations. However, the fishermen were very angry with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' weak attitude and expressed dissatisfaction with this treatment, sending many telegrams to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting that strong measures be taken. According to the survey report received yesterday, the captives stated that the obstruction of the Japanese fishing boat's fishing operations was under the official order of the KGB secret police department.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Japan's Labor Union Law Bill <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Cabinet Members Hold Divided Opinions.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Communication Society, Tokyo, June 30th: The Labor Union Bill of the Bureau of Social Affairs comes at a time when the pros and cons of labor and management are becoming increasingly fierce, and the cabinet is also divided into two factions discussing each other. Minister of Finance Inoue is the main opponent, stating that the bill recognizes labor groups and their group actions as being too beneficial to labor, which may provoke labor-management struggles and disrupt industrial peace. However, Minister of Postal Affairs Koizumi, etc., said that although the case is the original case of the Bureau of Social Affairs of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is based on the deliberation of the Industrial Council, which was established in accordance with the cabinet's policy. Since it has passed the Bureau of Legislation, it is already essentially a government proposal. If it is changed now, it will be cowardly and absolutely support the original proposal. Minister of Internal Affairs Adachi also has the same opinion, and Prime Minister Hamaguchi's opinion on the bill was originally publicly stated as approval, but when he spoke about the current situation at his villa in Kamakura the other day, he said that the Social Affairs Bureau's case has not been determined as a government case and that he must listen to all opinions before deciding on the government case. It has revealed a soft tone that made supporters of the original plan angry. However, judging from the opposition theory of pure capitalists like Minister of Finance Inoue and the contents of the bill, there are many who advocate partial amendments, so the trend of the bill will inevitably have considerable waves. Furthermore, judging from the opinions of the members of the House of Peers on the bill, members who have business relations and high-paying taxpayers are strongly opposed, and others mostly adopt a self-respecting attitude, saying that if it is submitted as a government proposal, it should not be opposed or stopped.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Memorial Week for the Central Government and the National Government <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Central Party Headquarters: The Central Party Headquarters held the 66th Memorial Week for the Premier in the auditorium at 9:00 a.m. on the 30th. Central Committee members Dai Chuanxian, Liu Jiwen, Chen Bulei, Chen Guofu, Enkebatu, Yu Jingtang, Miao Peicheng, and other officials from various departments and guests, totaling about five or six hundred people, attended. After Chairman Dai Chuanxian performed the ceremony, the chairman reported that the most important and urgent issues to be resolved now are military affairs and economic construction. Since the Party seized power, there have been two main tasks: (1) developing education and improving academics to create a new cultural foundation; and (2) developing the national economy so that the four major needs of the people for food, clothing, housing, and transportation can be well resolved. However, for the past two years, warlords and all reactionaries have wantonly caused trouble and refused to abandon their improper personal power to help with construction and destroy it instead. Therefore, the Central Government has been forced to use force, because if the reactionary forces are not eliminated one day, all construction goals will not be achieved, and there is no way to save the country or the people. In the past year, it can be seen that any reactionary force, whether the time is long or short, the scope is large or small, the result will eventually lead to extinction. Recently, Zhang Fakui in Hunan and the remnants of the Gui faction are about to end, and the main force of Yan Feng in the north has also been completely defeated. It is believed that the Central Army will soon win the final victory. During this period, the government and the people should unanimously focus on national construction, and as soon as the military affairs are over, they will show good results in construction so that the national economy can be consolidated. China's economic circles are now affected by the rise in gold exchange rates, and import and export trade has been sharply reduced. The market is extremely dangerous and panicky. Merchants in Shanghai feel that their position is low and their strength is weak, and they cannot escape the difficulties. Recently, they have become more aware of the need to cooperate with the Kuomintang and the National Government. Recalling that the Shanghai business community was enthusiastic about the revolution and sacrificed huge amounts of property for the sake of the Party's success, there are many who are still worthy of worship today. The merchant originally occupied an important position in society and must help the country create a sound government, and use the power of the country to protect merchants so that trade will not be controlled by others and will gradually develop. Old Chinese merchants have two habits: (1) taking business life as the purpose, knowing only business and not having a national concept; (2) inheriting the vanity of the former Qing dynasty's officials, wanting to use money and power to raise their status, but not distinguishing between public and private, knowing only how to be an official but not knowing that there is a government and not knowing how to love the country. Therefore, the failure of the national and social economy is the biggest reason. In the future, the Party should use propaganda to awaken ordinary merchants so that each can understand that the country and the nation are one life, and the government is to take charge of the lives of the people and relieve difficulties. It is necessary to look up to the purpose of the world as public, use strength to help the government, trust the government with sincerity, and recognize that helping the government is an obligation rather than friendship. China's business community has been subjected to economic aggression by imperialists for many years, and their policies have been constantly attacking us. Almost all of them are on the verge of bankruptcy and are in a precarious situation. All countries use the power of banks to assist the development of industry and commerce. In China's banking industry, the position of the industrial and commercial sectors is equal to that of accountants, and they have not been able to assist their business operations with their strength, resulting in little rapid progress in industry and commerce. It should be known that if industry and commerce have no way out, the status of the bank cannot be consolidated. It is hoped that the whole country will be of one mind and one virtue to seek practical cooperation in economic construction and achieve substantial progress. The meeting ended at 10:30.</p>
<p>National Government: At 10 a.m. on the same morning, the National Government held Memorial Week for the Premier. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Ma Fuxiang, Jiang Menglin, Yi Peiji, Liu Ruiheng, Zhang Nanxian, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Yi, Wei Daoming, Zhou Yawei, Li Mianlun, Zhang Wohua, and more than two hundred officials and military personnel from the two offices attended. After Chairman Tan performed the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao made a political report as follows: "The military situation on the front line is going smoothly, and Kaifeng can be taken down soon. Zhang Gui's remnants are at the end of their rope and will soon be destroyed. Now that the weather is getting hotter, the generals and soldiers on the front line are working very hard, and we in the rear should make double the effort. Recently, there have been many rumors from outside, especially from imperialists and reactionaries, who either create news of the enemy's victory or deliberately provoke us from within, doing everything they can. The first thing we must do is to remain calm and never be misled by those unknowledgeable and immature rumors. The Land Law was passed and promulgated at the State Council meeting last Friday. The law is divided into five chapters: general principles, land registration, land use, land tax, and land expropriation. Now, I will briefly explain the most important and noteworthy points of each chapter. (1) The most important thing in the general principles chapter is the provisions and restrictions on land ownership, etc. President Hu of the Legislative Yuan spoke about this at the Legislative Yuan Memorial Week, so I don't need to say more. (2) The thing to note in the land registration chapter is that Article 14 of the domestic policy states: "The state shall stipulate the Land Law, the Land Use Law, the Land Expropriation Law, and the Land Price Tax Law." Land registration was not specifically mentioned, but this time, a special chapter was established in the Land Law and listed after the general principles and before the other chapters. This is because land registration is a basic and necessary work for the implementation of land policy. (3) The most important thing in the land use chapter is to use labor and capital to improve the land, and the meaning of land use is active rather than passive, and productive rather than sitting back and enjoying. Therefore, the chapter emphasizes the following five points: A. The use of all land, whether in cities or villages, must be based on national economic policies and local needs. B. The use of urban housing should focus on protecting tenants in appropriate ways. C. The reclamation of wasteland should be based on supporting farmers and agricultural cooperatives. D. If the owners of privately owned wasteland cannot use it according to law or in a timely manner, there are tax laws to increase their burden or expropriation to allow others to use or cultivate it. Cultivating farmers or agricultural cooperatives can obtain land cultivation rights without compensation (this is not found in the land use rights of most modern countries). (4) The thing to note in the land tax chapter is that Article 14 of the domestic policy states: "The state shall stipulate the Land Law, the Land Use Law, the Land Expropriation Law, and the Land Price Tax Law." This time, the Land Law changed the land price tax to land tax because the former is only a part of the latter. Land tax includes land price tax and land appreciation tax. The so-called land appreciation tax is a progressive tax on unearned land appreciation, which is very important. As for all the provisions of the land tax, we only need to look at the difference in taxation of the land price tax for three types of land: wasteland is the heaviest, land that is not improved according to law is the second heaviest, and land that is improved according to law is the lightest. The principle of returning the wealth of the people to the people is based on the amount of appreciation, and the collection rate is progressive. The heavy tax on absentee landlords shows that the land tax is entirely for the purpose of developing production and promoting social interests. (5) The most important thing in the land expropriation chapter is to show that individual interests are subordinate to social interests. Therefore, the state can expropriate private land in accordance with the law due to the needs of public undertakings. At the same time, it is feared that there may be abuses. Therefore, the land owner is guaranteed when expropriating land, such as the need for careful preparation and procedures before expropriation, and it is stipulated that the expropriation is not completed until compensation for the expropriated land is completed, etc. In terms of the content of the above five chapters, it is very detailed. Now that it has been promulgated, the people of the country should have a considerable understanding of it, so that the implementation can be smooth in the future. I hope everyone will spend some time and effort to study it." Northeast</p>
<h3 id="e78">Navy Maintains Security in Qingdao <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>No Military Personnel Without Passports Allowed to Enter.</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since Han Fuqu's troops moved east along the Jiaoji Railway, there have recently been idle soldiers mixing into the Qingdao city jurisdiction. Foreign navies stationed in Qingdao fear that this will affect ground security and harm overseas Chinese. Yesterday, special envoys went to the Northeast Navy Headquarters, stating that if various troops enter Qingdao, and the Chinese Navy fails to maintain ground security, their respective countries will send troops to land and protect overseas Chinese. The Navy Headquarters informed them that the Navy is fully capable of maintaining security in the city and that there are no other concerns. Furthermore, the Navy stationed in Qingdao has no rights or relations, and all armies from the north and south are very understanding. They will resolve the issue and not come to Qingdao. Each country must not send troops to land and infringe upon our national rights without authorization to avoid accidents. At the same time, the Marine Corps stationed in Chengyang, Jimo, and Qingdao were ordered to strictly inspect and dissuade all military personnel coming and going. All idle military personnel are to be refused entry. Fearing that the navy's strength was weak, it was specially requested that the municipal government transfer the first and second squadrons of the security team from the Public Security Bureau, led by Squadron Leader Li Yuepu and Inspector Zhou Tianxi, to Chengyang by car on the 29th to cooperate with the road police and the Marine Corps stationed in Chengyang, and the treatment methods were stipulated as follows: A. For soldiers or a small number of soldiers with weapons, 1. Those who hold a passport from the head officer of their department and verify their task in Qingdao will be allowed to pass and their team number, name, and car number will be reported for verification. 2. Those who do not have a passport will be advised to return to their original defense area. Those who do not comply will be forced to return. However, those who state that they are going to Qingdao on official business and the investigation proves to be true can temporarily keep the weapons they carry, noting the number, and issuing it after the head officer of their department has proved it. B. The troops with weapons are advised to return to their original defense area. If they do not obey the restraint, avoid conflict and check their purpose, number of tasks, and car number and report by long-distance telephone for processing. C. For soldiers or a small number of soldiers without weapons, 1. Those who are there for no reason or not on official business are advised to return to their original defense area. Those who do not comply will be forced to return. 2. Those who come to Qingdao on official business should ascertain the situation and allow them to pass at the same time. The team number, name, and car number will be reported. In addition, if the long-distance telephone is not available due to urgent matters, the telephone number of the Road Bureau may be borrowed to report the Road Bureau for convenience. (June 28)</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: Chen Shaokuan, the acting Minister of the Navy and Commander of the Second Fleet, personally led the fleet to recover Yuezhou and Changsha in this aid to Hunan campaign, and then ordered the dispatch of warships to Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, and other places to pursue the remnants of the enemy. The river defenses were also arranged separately. In the Xiangjiang River, there are ships such as "Chu Tai Xian Ning", "Yi Sheng Cheng", etc. In the Yisha River, there are two ships, "De Sheng" and "Gong Sheng". In the Wuhan area, there is the torpedo squadron guerrilla commander Zeng Yiding, who leads four ships, "Chu Qian Jiang Yuan Jiang Zhenyong Sheng", to suppress Wuxue, Hukou, Jiujiang, etc. The three ships "Wei Sheng Minkun Jiang Kun" are responsible for defense. Chen himself recently took advantage of the fact that the enemy troops in Xiang Province have collapsed to Chenyong, and all the armies have been responsible for the siege. He does not need to stay in Xiang. Furthermore, the naval warfare must be reported to Commander-in-Chief Chiang in person, and he should ask for instructions on the opportunity. So on the 27th, he took the Chu You ship from Xiang to Hankou and arrived at 11:00 a.m. on the 28th, anchoring on the Hanyang River surface. The torpedo squadron guerrilla commander Zeng Yiding stationed in Hankou, Jiang Yuan captain Yang Shuhan, Jiang Zhen captain Liu Zexun, Yong Sheng captain Dai Xijing, and Wang Director and Lin Director of the Naval Office in Hankou all rushed to the ship to visit him. Chen stated the situation of pursuing the enemy in Xiang and ordered them to strengthen the defense of the upstream. At 6:00 p.m., the Chu You ship set sail and returned to Beijing.

<h3 id="e80">Zhang Zongchang's Recruitment Agency <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Using the name of the bogus Universal Morality Society; Appointing pseudo-officers of the Volunteer Army; A Shenyang dispatch reports that the Liaoning Provincial Police Department previously received a report from Guan Quanbin, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau of Liuhe County, stating that Zhang Yunpu and his brother from Fushun County are currently in Hongshizhen, in the jurisdiction of the Third District, using the name of the Universal Morality Society to preach doctrines with the intention of causing trouble in the Eastern Provinces and disrupting order. Director Sun Xuchang immediately issued an order to all counties to conduct strict investigations and arrests. Previously, the Fushun County Public Security Bureau arrested Liu Minfeng, Yang Zhaofu, and two others at the Yongtai Inn on Japanese coal mining land. At the same time, Ma Shaoxian and Guo Jingyang came to visit Liu Minfeng at the inn. Suspecting them of being accomplices, they were also arrested and interrogated. Liu Minfeng confessed that Zhang Yunpu and his elder brother Zhang Chengpu were both residing at the Haiquan Inn. The police were immediately ordered to arrest them, but Zhang Chengpu (i.e., Zhang Xiuting) had already fled. Only Zhang Yunpu (i.e., Zhang Yinpu, styled Xiufeng), Zhang Chengpu's wife, Zhang Liu, his daughter-in-law, Zhang He, Yang Zhaofu's younger brother, Yang Zhaofa, and four others were arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. Zhang Yinpu confessed that he and his elder brother Zhang Xiuting were both recruiters for the Universal Morality Society. This spring, Mingguo, a monk from Dabei Temple on Qiantai Mountain (secular name Zhang Shaochun), and Wu Ensheng, a resident of Huangdigou, said that they were ordered by Zhang Zongchang of Dalian to organize a volunteer army in the name of the Morality Society and appointed me as Chief of Staff. I, along with Zhang Xiuting, recruited Liu Minfeng and others into the society in the Hongshizhen area of ​​Liuhe County, and appointed Liu Minfeng and Yang Zhaofu as regimental commanders. Mingguo and Wu Ensheng were appointed as brigade commanders. The original leader, surnamed Du, and Zhang Zongchang of Dalian, were the army commanders. The leader surnamed Du has gone to Japan to meet with Zhang Zongchang. Mingguo and Wu Ensheng went to the Liaoning Morality Society to collect commissions and instructed Liu Minfeng and Yang Zhaofu to wait for commissions in Fushun. Ma Shaoxian and Guo Jingyang were new members of the society. When questioned, Liu Minfeng and Yang Zhaofu confessed to the previous situation without denying anything. When questioned, Guo Jingyang, Ma Shaoxian, and others only claimed to have visited Liu Minfeng at the inn and denied joining the society. Yang Zhaofa, Zhang Liu, and Zhang He all claimed that they had not joined the society. However, Zhang He testified that Zhang Yinpu and others believed in evil religions and recruited followers, which was true. Director Yao Shaoxiang of the First District Branch was ordered to search and arrest the monk Mingguo and Wu Ensheng, and to search for evidence at Zhang Yinpu's house. Later, it was reported that Mingguo and Wu Ensheng had already left and were not at home.</p>

<p>Only some evil religious items were found in Zhang Yinpu's home and sent to the bureau. The three people who were originally detained, Liu Minfeng, Yang Guangfu, and Zhang Yinpu, were handed over to Wang Baogui, the captain of the Public Security Brigade sent by Liuhe County to handle the case. The remaining five people, including Ma Shaoxian, were involved in a religious bandit case and could not be easily released, so they have been sent to the county government for interrogation (26th).</p>
<h3 id="e82">Recent Rice Shortage in Hunan Province <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Rice prices have also risen to 19 yuan per stone; A Changsha dispatch reports that Hunan Province is a rice-producing region with a large amount of rice exports annually. The budgeted rice donation income is 2 million yuan, but in reality, it always exceeds that amount by more than double. The average rice price per stone (148 catties) is below 12 yuan, which is cheaper than any port along the Yangtze River. However, recently, it has developed into an extremely serious shortage, with prices reaching 19 yuan per stone, and even with money, there is no rice to buy. There are two main reasons for this rice shortage: first, the government excessively issued rice permits last year, only seeking income from the permit fees, resulting in the transportation of grain from the interior and making it difficult to regulate the soaring rice prices; second, unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to hoard and speculate, hindering purchases and seeking profits. Government officials failed to maintain order properly, giving unscrupulous merchants the opportunity to control the market and causing today's shortage. More than a month ago, the rice price in Changsha City rose to over 10 yuan per stone, causing panic among the poor, who lamented the high price of rice. Government officials, gentry, and business circles, also recognizing the impact on people's livelihoods, immediately initiated the organization of a People's Food Maintenance Association, electing eleven members to be responsible for regulating the people's food supply. At that time, an investigation revealed that there were a total of over 300,000 stones of stored grain in the provincial capital, which was only enough to meet the needs until the new harvest. Therefore, a clear order was issued: (1) to prohibit the shipping of grain by river, train, or transport of grain out of the provincial capital; (2) starting from June 1st, to prohibit milling of cooked rice and only allow pushing and producing Qi rice (i.e., only removing the husk), with the intention of avoiding waste of grain and increasing the production of Qi rice to reduce rice prices; (3) to investigate poor households and prepare for subsidized sales; (4) to purchase Saigon rice to provide relief. Unexpectedly, the clear order had the opposite effect. Within one or two days, Qi rice suddenly rose to 12-13 yuan. Poor people carrying baskets on their shoulders often walked all day without being able to buy rice, while cooked rice rose to 18-19 yuan. The wealthy, accustomed to luxury, were unwilling to eat coarse food. Upon hearing the news of the prohibition on milling cooked rice, they disregarded the high prices and purchased and stored several months' worth of grain in advance. Suddenly, the market demand exceeded the supply. Although each rice factory and stackyard was producing rice day and night and raising market prices, it was still insufficient to meet the purchases of the wealthy. As a result, the price of cooked rice was high, and there was no time to produce Qi rice. Even the small amount of Qi rice that was produced and sold on the market was mixed with sand, stones, chaff, and bran, making it inedible, and the price was also raised along with the price of cooked rice. In addition, rice merchants took the opportunity to secretly produce cooked rice and store it in high-rise buildings, selling it at high prices, and only displaying a small amount of Qi rice to meet market demand, resulting in even higher black market prices for rice (Qi rice at 15 yuan per stone, cooked rice at 20 yuan). In the meantime, due to Zhang Gui's invasion of Hunan, military affairs were urgent, and there was no time to take care of the people's food crisis. Until recently, the poor had nothing to eat, and an investigation revealed that there were still over 200,000 stones of grain stored in the provincial capital, clearly indicating that unscrupulous merchants were hoarding and speculating, controlling the market for profit. Therefore, there were numerous petitions to the government to maintain the people's food supply, investigate unscrupulous merchants, and investigate the persons in charge of the People's Food Maintenance Association. As a result, Wei Suzhong, the commander of the Changsha Garrison, sent a letter to the Maintenance Association, saying, "Our army has restored order in Changsha and quelled the situation. We have long been preparing to maintain the people's food supply, but day by day, it continues to increase. The reason for this is that unscrupulous merchants are manipulating the market, hoarding goods, and even openly selling Qi rice while secretly selling cooked rice at higher prices. The situation is ambiguous. Although it is said to be maintenance, it is actually an opportunity for merchants to profit. If strict rectification is not carried out, the poor will not be able to live, and a terrible situation will inevitably be created, endangering public security. It is appropriate to send a letter to your association, requesting that you quickly find a way to stabilize prices to maintain the people's food supply. If any unscrupulous merchants still dare to profit from it and deliberately control the market, once our department discovers it, they will be punished as disturbers of public order and will not be tolerated." At the same time, the provincial government also sent personnel to secretly investigate the rice market, strictly prohibiting price increases, and allocated 12,000 stones of stored grain from the provincial warehouse to the People's Food Maintenance Association to expedite subsidized sales. They also telegraphed Shanghai merchants to rush the shipment of Saigon rice to Hunan to provide relief. The Maintenance Association then convened an emergency meeting at 4:00 p.m. on the 26th, attended by ten people, including Xiao Laisheng, and elected Pi Zongrang as chairman. It was resolved that subsidized sales would be launched in advance on July 1st. Zhang Dacong and Luo Qingyun were appointed as directors of the Eastern District, Hu Junfu and Xie Jusheng were appointed as directors of the Southern District, Zhang Shurong and Cheng Qianhe were appointed as directors of the Western District, and Chen Liaosheng and Huang Peishi were appointed as directors of the Northern District, dividing the city into four districts for subsidized sales. Li Xi Zhuan and Yang Hengzhai were appointed as standing committee members for subsidized sales, Li Jingtao and Liu Boheng were appointed as finance committee members, Huang Zhizhou was appointed as a member of the purchasing committee for beans and grains, Wang Boqing, Xie Zixian, and Zhang Xiangquan were appointed as food distribution committee members and were responsible for milling grain, and Feng Gengtao, Ding Ziqin, and Xiong Fanzhou were appointed as investigation committee members. It was also stipulated that the subsidized sales would be carried out with a combination of rice and beans, with each adult receiving five he of rice and three he of beans per day, and each child receiving three he of rice and one he of beans per day, according to the registered list of poor households. Rice purchase certificates would be distributed directly to each district for daily purchases. It was estimated that there were over 93,000 poor households in the entire city. As for the Saigon rice to be purchased, it was limited to arriving in Hunan on July 1st and would be distributed at the purchase market price and shipping costs. Government agencies, organizations, or wealthy households would also be charged within 18 yuan. With these regulations, it may be possible to prevent an unexpected situation from developing (27th).</p>
<h3 id="e83">Jiangsu Entomological Bureau Tests Poison Bait for Locust Control <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The use of poison bait to kill locusts is a common method in all locust-producing countries in the world. Since its establishment, the Jiangsu Entomological Bureau has conducted many tests, but the results have not been significant, so it has not been widely adopted. This is because the conditions in each locust-producing region are different, and the types of locusts are also different. What is suitable for one place may not be suitable for another. Since Chen Jiaxiang, the director of the Locust Research Institute of the Bureau, obtained considerable results in a test in Liuhe last year, he planned to conduct a large-scale test this year, designating Chongming as the test area. However, since the area of Chongming County was too large, it was changed to Bagua Island as the test area. Unexpectedly, this year there was a lot of rain, and the locust eggs on Bagua Island rotted and did not hatch. It was then heard that locusts were occurring in Chongming, so the Bureau immediately ordered Director Chen to lead researcher Huang Zhongqiang to Chongming with a large amount of white arsenic. However, the few locust nymphs in Chongming had already been eaten by ducks. Therefore, they conducted a test in Wangyang Village, Haimen on June 22. However, the ground was mostly water in the areas where there were locust nymphs, so poison bait could not be applied. They had no choice but to choose more than ten mu of land without water for the test. After 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd, three pounds of poison bait were applied per mu. The ratio of the mixture was one part white arsenic, one part brown sugar, thirty parts wheat bran, and twenty-five parts water (by weight). On the 24th, there were a few dead locust nymphs on the ground. On the 25th, there were more. On the morning of the 26th, an inspection revealed even more. The most numerous area had fifteen locust nymphs per square foot, with an average of about four locust nymphs per square foot. It was estimated that there were 24,000 dead locust nymphs per mu. Even the winged locusts that had emerged a few days ago had died. The effectiveness of the poison bait had not yet expired, but after a heavy thunderstorm in the middle of the night on the 25th, the poison bait was completely washed away, which was very regrettable. In addition, locust nymphs like to migrate, and many locust nymphs from watery areas migrated to the areas where poison bait had been applied. Also, locust nymphs need one or two days to die after eating poison bait. Before the toxicity takes effect, they often migrate to other places, making it difficult to calculate the percentage of locusts killed. Therefore, testing in that area was very unsuitable. It is now heard that Mr. Chen and others are about to leave Wangyang Village and go to other places to look for suitable locust-infested locations for testing, according to a local dispatch.</p>

<p>Police squad goes to Xin to drive out refugees. Yesterday, over three hundred refugees arrived in Xinzhuang Town. Men, women, old, and young were there. For a time, the people were nervous. Inspector Zhou of the Public Security Branch immediately led police officers to suppress the situation. However, the refugees were very strong. The local police force was weak. They specially sent someone to Songjiang to report to the county. Magistrate Jin has now transferred two squads of the county police's first squad to drive to Xin by car to drive out the refugees and avoid causing any trouble. The Fengjing robbery and murder case has been reported. The farmer of the Mou surname in the 26th Tu, Fenwutou, Fengjing, suddenly had more than ten bandits break into the house and carry out a robbery the night before. It is heard that the victim had previously been threatened by bandits who demanded a large sum of money. It is not known why he was again robbed and murdered by bandits this time. His death was very pitiful. It is heard that the bandits who came were the same bandits who had previously extorted money, and they were seeking revenge for grudges. The case has been reported to the county for investigation. The county government immediately appointed Secretary Zhang to go to the countryside for inspection yesterday. Punan Zhalin hailstorm causes disaster. On a certain day last month, the weather changed suddenly and a hailstorm fell. Farmers in Punan and other townships who planted cotton suffered a great blow. Farmers in Fengxian and Minhang were all sad. Although this county is a rice-producing area, Zhalin, which is part of the county, is located on the coast and has always been engaged in cotton planting. Since the hailstorm, the cotton plants have withered. This year's harvest is completely hopeless. The old farmers all said that fortunately, the hailstorm came early. If they could find cotton seeds to replant, they could still sprout. However, even if they are successful, the harvest will be greatly affected. However, it is heard that cotton seeds are in short supply and difficult to purchase. Therefore, the disaster in the third ward, which was the most severely affected, has been reported to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>Bandit traces are found in all townships. Since last year, bandits have been rampant in this county, and robberies have been frequent. Local residents cannot bear it. Previously, Chen Zekuan, the director of the first district of the Provincial Water Police Corps, sent a team to Zhu to join the county police team to search for bandits in Qianjiawei and Kongjiaque. Several bandits were immediately arrested. Unexpectedly, there were more than ten bandits hiding in the home of Ling A-gui, the head of the Bochi Nunnery. When they saw the police team arriving, they first fired shots. A police officer from the county police team was shot and killed, and the bandits took the opportunity to escape. Afterwards, a lot of stolen goods were found in Ling A-gui's house, which was confirmed to be a bandit den, and it was burned down. Since then, the bandits' traces have been slightly restrained. However, before long, they saw that the police team had left and knew that there was nothing to fear, so they relapsed. As for Dianxiaqiao, Liujiawan, Bazhiqiao, Qianjiawei, Kongjiaque, Wanchunqiao, Xiaoshantang, Mingzhuan and other townships, bandit traces have been found in all of them recently. Their lairs are located near the townships, such as Nanjiao, Louqian, Caoan, Baimike, Sanqinggang, Lijiagangxia, etc. In addition to occupying temples and tombs, they have recently been forcibly occupying people's houses, moving and fleeing day and night. When the military police arrive, they have already heard the news and hid. Therefore, if you want to find the root cause, you must conduct strict investigation. It is also heard that a gang of bandits, Jin Fei, has more than one hundred members. They were originally active in other places, but now they have also joined the Taibao A-shu gang, so their power is becoming more and more rampant. The gang of bandits even paraded with full arms and fluttering red flags the day before. Then they went to Langxia Town and intimidated the merchants to extort 1,200 yuan. In addition, dozens of threatening letters have been received in various places, all of which were sent by Taibao A-shu and Xu A-jin through their subordinates Gu A-long, Xi Daoming, Dai Kechang, Zhang A-mu, and Wang A-jiu to extort thousands of yuan or hundreds of yuan, depending on the case.</p>

<p>Heavy Thunderstorm in Suzhou City</p>
<p>On the evening of the previous day (29th) around 6:00 or 7:00 p.m., there was a heavy thunderstorm in Suzhou City. The electric lights outside Lumu Gate went out at 7:18 p.m. and the streets were plunged into darkness for 27 minutes. They finally came back on at 7:45 p.m. Afterwards, it was discovered that the telephone lines were down in Jiejia Bridge, the eastern and western parts of the central market, and the areas outside the city, affecting as many as 150 or 160 households. Also, at 6:30 p.m., two particularly large claps of thunder struck. One of the wooden flagpoles in front of the old provincial government (i.e., the current Customs Superintendent's Office) on the left side was destroyed. The area about seven or eight feet below the dougong (bracket set) of the flagpole was struck, and the dougong fell to the ground in pieces. The broken wood that fell to the ground was about twenty or thirty feet long. At the same time, at the house of Hou Zhuang-sheng at No. 39 Songxianzhou Alley, a ball of fire the size of a washbasin appeared, emitting red light with purple and green hues. It came straight down through a crack in the bricks in the middle of the first rafter on the south side of the first bay of the house. It was only a few feet away from the bed and where people were standing. Afterwards, this ball of fire charged up towards the tip of the mountain wall next to the second bay of the house. Because the bricks were strong and thick, it could not break through immediately. It then moved horizontally along the roof, passing over the bottom of the bricks on the second bay of the house and striking the second beam of the third bay, breaking the house and flying away. Also, the house of Zhang Min-nong at No. 14 Niuyachang, behind Tongren Street, under Lumu Gate, collapsed, crushing the bed. Fortunately, the family was having dinner in the outer room and was not injured. In addition, there were many other incidents of collapsing houses and destruction.</p>

<p>Solving a Robbery and Murder Case</p>
<p>On the evening of the 22nd of this month, Jiangbei bandits robbed the home of Dai Yongxing, a carpenter in Wangjiabang Village, Lingjinglang Township, Taipingqiao Township, which is part of the county. The robbers stole 120-130 yuan in foreign currency, three shi of wheat, and two shi of rice. At the time, Dai's wife resisted the robbers with an axe, but was instead slashed in the head. Dai Yongxing was slashed to death by the robbers on the spot. The local bailiff reported the case to the court and went to the village for an examination. Neighbors reported that Chen Xi from Yancheng was related to the case. At that time, Chen had fled. Chen's wife, Guo, was taken to the court for investigation and is on file. Yesterday (30th), Xu Fengshan, the detective of the Third District of the Water Police, led detectives Shao Yuanlong, Yang Baokang, Kong Qingchang, and Qian Jin to investigate. They learned that Chen Xi was hiding in the area outside Qimu Gate. At about 11:00 a.m., they secretly inquired at the Qiyilou Teahouse outside Qimu Gate. Chen Xi also arrived at the teahouse at 2:00 p.m. and was captured by Detective Xu and others. He was escorted back to the district headquarters, where District Chief Gong interrogated him on the spot. According to Chen Xi's confession, he is 50 years old, also known as Lao Chen. He has been buying and dismantling old houses in Taipingqiao Lingjinglang for his livelihood, and lives on a small boat. He has a total of three wives. The robbery of Dai Yongxing's house was committed by the Pan Changshan and Pan Guanghong brothers. They are also from Yancheng. He heard that they stole three shi of wheat, two shi of rice, and about 120-130 yuan in foreign currency. At that time, I was in Suzhou. After they robbed the loot, they went to Pan Guanghong's boat. Now they have escaped to the area of ​​Luxiang Hengjing. Now my wife has been arrested by the local court. This is really a injustice. Please have mercy, sir.

<p>Cai Yizhi's Incest Case</p>
<p>Bribery Leads to Detention. Cai Yizhi of Baoben Street in the city was sentenced to death by the county government for the matricide case in the winter of the year before last. Cai then filed an appeal. The Suzhou Higher Court, in order to clarify the truth, divided and summoned seven people, including Yue Guniang, Zhang Xiqing, and Lu Jusheng and Xu Zhensheng, police officers of the county government, to be tried on July 2. Jiang Kuiyuan, a Shanghai silk merchant (i.e., Wang Ziping), came to Chang from Shanghai on the 26th to Beishixin Street and contacted Xu Zhensheng, a police officer. He claimed that he was entrusted by Zhang Zhixuan, a lawyer from Ximenwai, Shanghai, to Chang specially to find a way to overthrow Cai Yizhi's previous confession. He asked Xu to greet the summoned police officers to testify in court and prove that Cai's previous confession was indeed a confession. If the previous confession was overturned, I would pay you 1,000 yuan on behalf of Cai. At that time, Xu falsely agreed. Wang then took out 60 yuan in banknotes and gave it to Xu as travel expenses to Suzhou. Xu then returned to the county to report. Stone trial judge issued a warrant and sent police to the Dafang Hotel where Jiang Kuiyuan was staying to arrest Jiang. After questioning, he confessed that he was introduced by a relative surnamed Shen who had a slight relationship with Cai Yizhi to the lawyer Zhang Zhirang and asked me to handle this matter and presented a letter from lawyer Zhang to Jiang and a list of the police officers who were contacted. During the court hearing, police officer Xu Zhensheng testified about Jiang Kuiyuan's bribery. Stone trial judge ordered Jiang to be detained. The next day (28th), he was brought back to court for questioning. He claimed that Cai Yizhi's third concubine, Cai Lishi (i.e., Yue Guniang), was my aunt. I have no relationship with the surnamed Shen. I came to Chang to clear the way for the police. Stone trial judge questioned and asked what was the method you thought of? Jiang replied that Lawyer Zhang came up with the idea and asked me to do the police bribery. The 60 yuan was given to me by Cai Lishi. After questioning, he was still detained.</p>

<p>Investigation into the Case of the Company Commander Being Robbed of Military Pay: Wang Longdao, the company commander of the 8th Company, 2nd Battalion, 1st Regiment of the Chengcheng (Jiangyin) Garrison, was robbed of over 1,250 silver dollars of his April military pay on the evening of the 26th. Upon receiving the report, the regimental headquarters immediately dispatched Adjutant Zhu Youyun to Chengcheng to conduct an on-the-ground investigation. At the time, Guo Hongjin, a committee member assigned by the Ministry of Military Affairs, and Pan Yuan, the Director of the Military Supplies Department of the Capital Garrison Headquarters, were distributing pay for the garrison regiment along the Changzhou-Shanghai railway line. According to Mr. Jin from the regimental headquarters in Wuxi, who spoke to the two committee members about the circumstances of the 8th Company's pay being robbed, the two committee members immediately came to Chengcheng and sent a letter to the county government inquiring about the case's progress and handling. County Magistrate Li then ordered the Public Security Bureau to submit a report. The Public Security Bureau's report briefly stated that after receiving a phone call from the paymaster, who stated that Company Commander Wang had hired his rickshaw outside the South Gate and ordered him to pull to the North Gate, the rickshaw puller suddenly pulled to the East Gate, and the rickshaw puller's appearance and number were not remembered. Later, the bureau chief and the detective team, together with the garrison troops, surveyed the area outside the East Gate and encountered the paymaster, who stated that the company commander had originally gone to the North Gate and had arranged to send troops to the North Gate to wait, but unexpectedly he suddenly went to the East Gate. Someone on the boat inquired about the names of the company headquarters' buglers, etc. When being robbed, he saw a person in yellow clothes walk by for a few seconds, and then three or four people pushed the company commander into the field. The secret arrest of the robbers is currently underway, etc. Yesterday (the 29th), Committee Members Pan and Guo had already left Chengcheng. On the same day, after searching, suspects Zhou Fengyi, Zhu Lao San, Xu Shoulin, Zhou Juru, etc., were arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau to be transferred to the county government for interrogation.</p>
<p>Investigation into Shi Chunsheng, who was Found to Be Suspicious: Wu Shanbao, a detective of the Public Security Bureau, and others, were recently ordered to investigate the case of Wang Tongfu and Bao Hansheng in Changjing Town, the 12th District. On the 28th, after Zhou Xiban's small steamer arrived at the port, Shi Chunsheng, who was found to be suspicious, was arrested. Two other people resembling soldiers or policemen took the opportunity to escape. He was sent to the district office. He claimed to have been sent by the Nanjing Special Municipal Party Department to investigate the case and showed a letter of commission issued by the Central Party Headquarters' Secretariat, following the Chairman's handwritten instructions. According to a secret report from Jiangyin citizens Cao Guocheng and Li Chuqing, Miao Chaoqun, who teaches at Changjing Junior High School in Qiaoqi Township, Cheng County, is a Communist Party member. Please arrest and investigate him. The letter of commission was issued by the Special Municipal Party Department using letterhead with an oval seal on June 18th and included two free train and boat travel permits, two business cards, and a book: "Military Magazine of the Central Military Academy, Lieutenant Secretary Shi Chunsheng, also known as Shufu, from Shaowu County, Fujian," and a book titled "Former Third Section Chief of Jiangyin County," etc. After arriving at the district office, Shi wrote three urgent letters in double-lined envelopes to the Special Municipal Party Department, Guo Jun and Huang Zhichen, etc., asking for help, and attached a letter to the Supreme Court, Ding Gongmao and Xiong Zheshen, asking Chen Qiuqi, the head of the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce, and County Magistrate Li Leng to certify that it was not a fake municipal party committee member. It had already been sent to the post office, but the district office intercepted it, along with a letter to County Magistrate Li and a No. 26 badge from the Municipal Party Department. On the afternoon of the 29th, he was escorted to the Public Security Bureau by the Qincheng small steamer. At about 9:00 p.m., Bureau Chief Li interrogated him. According to Shi, he followed the Revolutionary Army in the Northern Expedition in the winter of the 15th year of the Republic (Headquarters of the 2nd Regiment, 1st Division, 14th Army) and arrived in Jiangsu. In February of the 16th year of the Republic, he arrived in Jiangyin. Because he had been wounded by bullets while attacking Jiangxi and had not yet recovered, he could no longer follow the army on its long journey. Therefore, he requested his regimental commander, Liao, to introduce him to the Jiangyin County Government and was reassigned to the Third Section as a section member. Later, County Magistrate Wang Guozuo appointed him as the director to temporarily take charge of the section's affairs. Later, he received a letter from home urging him to return home, so he returned to Fujian in May of the 16th year of the Republic. In the summer of the 18th year of the Republic, he was introduced by his teacher, Ding Boheng, who is now the Director of the Translation Section of the Military Magazine, to work as a secretary in the magazine. This June, he received a telegram from his elderly father at home (a native of Shaoxing, Zhejiang, who was appointed as the magistrate of Shaowu during the Qing Dynasty and stayed in Shaowu for twenty years) saying that the situation in Fujian was critical and urging him to return to Fujian as soon as possible to take care of family affairs. Therefore, he asked his superiors for leave to return home on June 18th and was approved and issued a travel permit. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Shanghai, he heard that transportation in Fujian was blocked and that personnel from the Revolutionary Army entering Fujian were being subjected to increased scrutiny. Therefore, he did not dare to return home. Because the cost of living in Shanghai was too high and everything was expensive, it was not easy to live there. He then turned back. However, since he had already asked for leave, it was not convenient to return to the magazine immediately. A man from Changzhou named Li Zutai, with the courtesy name of Shuhua, had served as the director of the 8th District Tobacco and Alcohol Affairs Bureau in Shaowu ten years ago. His father had an eight-bow friendship with Li Zutai's father, and Li Zutai had taught him to write essays. Because of this relationship, he planned to temporarily rely on him. He would wait until Fujian was peaceful before returning home or transferring to the magazine to take up his duties. Unexpectedly, Li's address could not be found. He heard from the tea houses in the Changzhou hostel that Li seemed to be working in Changshu, but it was not confirmed. Helpless, he planned to come to Jiangyin to find his fellow villager Wu Chu because Wu had been stationed in Changshu and was familiar with the situation. Unfortunately, when he arrived in Jiangyin, Wu was not there. He had no choice but to stop here for a few days and did not visit any friends. He took a boat to Changshu on the 29th of the lunar calendar, but unexpectedly, Mr. Li was not there, so he made a wasted trip. Yesterday, he planned to return to Jiangyin and transfer to another place. However, on the way to Changjing, he suddenly suffered from an old illness and heart pain, so he temporarily wanted to rest in Changjing for a day before continuing his journey. When he arrived in Changjing, he stayed at a small inn. While wandering around on the way, he accidentally encountered Miao Chaoqun, a prostitute in Jiangyin who had a grudge against him. Miao Chaoqun greeted him. He secretly thought that the past feud had been forgotten after many years, so he had no choice but to exchange pleasantries with him. Miao insisted on providing him with food and lodging. Because he could not refuse, he went with Miao to his place. Unexpectedly, Miao harbored resentment and asked him, "You are a member of the military. You have come here alone after many years. Are you not a Communist Party detective?" He immediately stated that he was working at the Military Magazine of the National Revolutionary Army and had a passport as proof. He also said that he had often met with comrades from the Special Municipal Party Department in Nanjing. How could he be a Communist Party member? Moreover, Guo Jun, Huang Zhichen, and Zhang Shaoxian, three fellow villagers from the Special Municipal Party Department, had given him a badge from the Party Department so that he would not be mistaken for someone else on the road and could prove that he was a member of the Kuomintang. All of the above can be investigated. Unexpectedly, Miao, unable to harm him by calling him a Communist, used kind words to cover up his actions and insisted on keeping him in the school overnight. Because he wanted to explain his actions in Changjing, he was willing to stay there to show that he had not violated any laws. After dinner, he went out for a walk and returned to the school at 7:00 p.m. He did not see Miao return. After some time, the local defense corps and the detective team came to arrest him, etc. After the interrogation, he was detained and will be sent to the county government on the 30th for interrogation.</p>

<p>Bandits Set Fire to Zhu Chen Village: On the night of the 25th, a group of bandits suddenly came to the home of Guo Anchen in Zhu Chen Village, south of Rugao City, armed with guns and breaking down the door. They first looted all the clothes, food, and other belongings, and then set fire to the entire house with kerosene and piled-up straw. Three main rooms were burned down, and all the furnishings were destroyed. Fortunately, the security corps stationed in Guo's mansion heard the alarm and led the team to the rescue, opening fire on the bandits, who then fled into the distance. Only the board walls and central pillars of the factory, hall, and side rooms were burned down, causing losses of no less than ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Bandits Rob Wealth and Extort Money: The family of Wu Zhengqing in Songjia Village, Dongchen District, is of modest means.

The incident caused a great uproar in the city for a time. Yesterday, the county government convened an emergency meeting of various agencies and organizations. The issue of disarming the defense corps was resolved through peaceful means. Ding was arrested, and Xu was temporarily released on bail, to be summoned at any time. All matters will be investigated for verification. It is said that they were falsely accused by bandits, but the truth is not yet known.</p>

<p>Bandits Captured in Quan Gong Pavilion: Since the local bandits in the east were severely suppressed by the military, their power has been collapsing. Recently, they gathered again in the area of Quan Gong Pavilion and Zhujia Dun, thinking of making trouble again. The Pinghu Camp headquarters learned of this and secretly ordered the 4th Company of the Provincial Security Team stationed in Xincang to encircle and suppress them. The company immediately surrounded and advanced from Sanyou River, Zhang Shu Tree, Zhujia Bridge, and other places. When they arrived at Quan Gong Pavilion, they saw five people dressed in a uniform manner resembling bandits in a certain tea house. When they saw the troops, they tried to escape. One person jumped into the river in an attempt to flee but was shot dead by the troops. Two others were shot on the spot and captured. It is reported that the names of the five people are Wu Zhenshi, Chen Jinlong Jiaozixiong, Tang Zhaohe, and Cai Arong.</p>
<p>Case of Forged Ginseng to be Interrogated Today: Tao Qinqiu, the owner of Jingyi Tang Pharmacy in this county, used fake ginseng worth 18 yuan to defraud Yan Acupuncture of Songfengtai of 240 yuan and forged the seals and invoices of a certain ginseng company in Shanghai.

<p>The Chunhui Middle School Bandit Case: It has been half a month since the Chunhui Middle School bandit case occurred. The three kidnapped people are still in danger. Principal Fan Shoukang and teacher Wu Minxing recently sent letters to their families from the bandit's den, detailing their various difficulties. Fan Shoukang's father, Fan Gaoping, came south from Yingkou after hearing the news to try to rescue his son. The bandits believe that Fan Gaoping has been doing business in the north for many years and must have a lot of wealth. Therefore, they have very high expectations. In fact, Fan has suffered repeated business failures in recent years due to the current situation, and he is naturally generous and enthusiastic about public welfare and has no savings. Even if he wants to prepare money for redemption, it will be difficult. Therefore, it is still unknown whether his beloved son can be rescued. The reporter visited Fan yesterday to inquire about the recent situation. Fan replied that he had incurred a great deal of debt before the 15th year of the Republic, which his relatives and friends knew. He only made a small profit after operating a refined salt company starting in the 16th year of the Republic and gradually paid off his old debts. Although he has gained some reputation in recent years, the only things that can be called assets are various stocks such as Jiudali Yuan, with a face value of only 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Last year, due to business failure, he mortgaged a portion of the stocks to the Coal Industry Zhengli and Liang Banks for 20,000 yuan. Moreover, he has always advocated the abolition of inheritance and responded to the request of the local education community years ago to designate 20,000 yuan as an education fund. The remainder is for his own retirement needs, which is still not enough. Now that his beloved son has suffered this unexpected disaster, he will of course do his best to rescue him, but if the rescue costs are beyond his ability, he can only listen to fate.

<p>Joint Graduation Ceremony</p>
<p>Continuing to Hold Primary School Concert</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Primary School Joint Graduation Ceremony, hosted by the Municipal Education Bureau, was held at the Zhabei Renewal Stage at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. More than 2,500 graduates from various schools attended. Director Chen, the chairman, performed the ceremony as usual.</p>
<p>Director's Speech: Today is the first joint graduation ceremony of Shanghai Municipal Primary Schools. There have been two joint ceremonies in the past, but only municipal schools were included. Private schools that were registered were not included. This year, registered private schools that participated in the joint examination have joined, so this can be said to be the joint graduation ceremony of all primary schools in Shanghai. The graduates this time faced more difficulties than before because they had to pass the joint examination to graduate. In the past, the power to decide whether or not to graduate rested with the head of the school, and often due to the considerable feelings between teachers and students, students with relatively poor grades were also allowed to graduate. I believe that primary school students are the foundation of all schools. Whether or not they can achieve great things and become good citizens in the future depends on their primary school years. Therefore, primary schools should be taken seriously. If grades are not good, but graduation is allowed due to personal feelings, it will have a great impact on the country and the nation in the future. Therefore, the joint examination is used to determine whether or not to graduate. Many of those who participated in the examination but failed to graduate are not necessarily worse than those who graduated, but those who graduated have paid considerable attention to their studies and are able to enjoy today's honor. After graduation, they will either work or continue their studies. You should all know that your knowledge is too little and your existing knowledge is not enough to apply. Whether you continue your studies or not, you must continue to work hard after graduation. Everything in the world is learning, and everyone in the world except me is my teacher. Therefore, you must study everywhere in society and pay attention at all times, and you will surely achieve considerable success in the future. I am very happy today that everyone has a good attitude and can maintain order. I hope that everyone will always maintain this good attitude and the good habit of maintaining order. You will naturally be a good citizen in society in the future. At the same time, let others see you and want to learn to be a good citizen. After the ceremony, there will be a concert. On the one hand, it will make us happy, and on the other hand, it will cultivate our character. Don't forget this memorable June 30th, my words, and your good attitude and order today.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech: Secretary Cen Dezhang delivered the speech on behalf of the Mayor. This graduation ceremony used the method of joint examination. Before the examination, the municipal government and the education bureau felt that the level of Shanghai's municipal and private primary schools was uneven, and the quality of education varied. Therefore, the idea of a joint examination was proposed. After the examination, according to Director Chen's report, the level was indeed uneven. The uneven level has an impact on teaching materials and teachers. In particular, it has suppressed many talented and good students. The classmates who participated in this graduation ceremony are naturally very honored. I hope you will tell the classmates who failed the examination that failure is the mother of success, and that if you work hard again, you will surely graduate next year. In particular, I hope that those who graduated will not be arrogant and think that passing the joint examination is just the best stage of your life. There will be many difficult examinations to enter middle school and university in the future. Finally, I offer three key points for everyone, whether you continue your studies or work in the future: (1) what, (2) how to seek, and (3) why to seek. Maintaining this attitude at all times will bring great progress.</p>
<p>Speech by the Representative of the Party Department: Huang Zaoxiong delivered a speech and briefly reported on a point of view. China has two difficult problems to solve: (1) There are too many Chinese people with shallow knowledge. In other words, there are still many people who have not received primary school education. Today, all of you have received this primary school education and graduated. From today onwards, China will have another group of knowledgeable citizens. I hope that everyone will become a good, knowledgeable citizen who has received primary school education. (2) There is a lack of talented people with advanced knowledge in Chinese society. To have advanced knowledge, you must obtain advanced education. Therefore, I hope that everyone will continue to seek advanced knowledge, from primary school to middle school to university to graduate school, so that China can add many more talented people with advanced knowledge who are needed by society.</p>
<p>Speech by the Representative of the Principals: Wu Bokang, the principal of Wanzhu School, delivered a speech. This joint graduation ceremony is more grand than the previous two because this time it comes from a joint examination, so this graduation is also more accurate. Many of you children will no longer pursue further studies from now on, and many will continue their studies. Bokang, on behalf of the principals, has a few words to tell you. To the children who do not enter school, you must still be careful and learn knowledge and skills everywhere. The school only leads you to the door. From now on, it will be the opening of your career. There are many things in society that you can research and discuss, as long as you are willing to be careful. Among the children who continue their studies in middle school, there is a bad habit. Now, there are many reactionary elements who use a theory to lure young people. The teachers in primary school manage strictly, but middle school is different. You must always pay attention and not be tempted by others. Many good young people are very good in primary school, but later they are led astray by others. I hope everyone will pay attention.</p>

<p>National Jinan University has always been famous at home and abroad for its expertise in sports. Recently, a well-known middle school in Jiangsu Province has extended an invitation to a sports teacher from the school to serve as a track and field coach and ball sports instructor, and to teach general gymnastics for about 16 hours per week. The treatment is generous (more than 100 yuan per month). Among the school's graduates in the past, there is no shortage of talents to choose from, but they all want to show their skills again in the next Far East Games and win glory for the country. If they accept this appointment, they will inevitably lose their amateur qualifications. The school's sports major is still in preparation, so for the time being, it has to find sports teachers from other schools to find a qualified person with a degree in sports from a national or registered private university, or a graduate of a sports major with high skills and rich teaching experience, or a graduate of a university with special research in sports who has a considerable position in previous sports meets. If you wish to apply, you can send a detailed resume and a letter of introduction from your alma mater directly to "Mr. Li Bangdong, Jinan University, Zhenru." After strict review and evaluation, if you are deemed qualified, you will be notified of the appointment.</p>

<p>Anniversary of the Establishment of the National Government The City Party Headquarters Convened a Representative Meeting of All Sectors Held at 9:00 AM in the Headquarters Auditorium</p>
<p>Today is the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the National Government. The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters specifically convened representatives from all levels of party and government agencies and mass organizations in the city at 9:00 AM today in the auditorium of the headquarters to hold a commemorative meeting. A notice has been issued and a message to the public has been published on the left. Revolutionary people of Shanghai City, the National Government has been established for five years since today. In the experience of these five years, we really have to recall with grief. When the National Government was established, not only was the traitorous Duan government in the north rampant, wantonly slaughtering the people and humiliating the country and flattering foreign countries, but also in our revolutionary base, Chen Jiongming, a traitor in the east and south,肆意咆哮毁黨禍國之毒心亦不讓於今日閻馮之徒然 本黨以當時革命民衆期望本黨出師之殷 不得不排除萬難成立國民政府開始北伐大業 計自民國十五年七月十五日誓師以後 首先肅清陳逆炯明餘孽以免後顧之憂 不數月間剷除吳佩孚孫傳芳兩大軍閥 中原及長江下流各省次第克復 是時義師所至 萬民歡騰 本黨方期一鼓盪平餘寇 完成北伐大業 不期共産黨徒受赤色帝國主義者慫恿 從中阻梗 本黨不得不先清心腹之患 致北地同胞遭受軍閥統治之厄運者遷延幾及兩載 至十七年 本黨仍繼續北伐 卒賴民衆與本黨一致之努力 收復北平 開民國以來未有之奇績 本黨於統一中國以後 乃努力實施編遣 從事建設 又不期新興軍閥屢起屢仆 屢仆屢起 國民政府從事於戡暴定亂 未能依預定步驟而順利進行 誠不能無憾 然觀於國民政府在此五年內困苦經營 卒能逢凶化吉 當可確信國民政府基礎之鞏固 殊非一二跳梁小醜所能撼動者也 復次國民政府對於外交上之努力 亦經獲得相當之成績 有爲吾人所樂道者 吾人鑒於過去軍閥政府無論此興彼仆 其於媚外政策一若衣鉢相傳 獨我國民政府成立以還 即以廢除不平等條約爲對外確定之政策 數年間 如各國新約之改訂 關稅權之牧回 雖其內容不能謂完全勝利 然我國國際地位之日有增進 乃爲不可否認之事實 吾人於此可確信國民政府依此步驟而行 中國民族之解除帝國主義者之壓迫 實非短時間內不可能之事 今日紀念國民政府成立 吾人當擁護國民政府 對內掃除軍閥餘孽 肅清反動份子 實施訓政建設 對外繼續國民外交 廢除不平等條約 求中國之自由平等 願我革命民衆深所注意焉肆意咆哮毁黨禍國之毒心亦不讓於今日閻馮之徒然 The Party, in view of the revolutionary masses' expectations of the Party's expedition, had to overcome all difficulties to establish the National Government and start the Northern Expedition. Since the oath was taken on July 15th of the 15th year of the Republic of China, the remnants of Chen Jiongming, a traitor, were first wiped out to avoid future troubles. Within a few months, the two major warlords Wu Peifu and Sun Chuanfang were eliminated. The provinces in the Central Plains and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were successively recovered. At that time, the righteous army arrived, and the people rejoiced. The Party was planning to sweep away the remaining bandits in one fell swoop and complete the Northern Expedition. Unexpectedly, the Communists were instigated by red imperialists and obstructed it from the middle. The Party had to clear its confidants first, causing the compatriots in the north to suffer the misfortune of warlord rule for nearly two years. In the 17th year, the Party continued the Northern Expedition and finally relied on the united efforts of the people and the Party to recover Beiping, creating a miracle unprecedented since the Republic of China. After the Party unified China, it worked hard to implement reorganization and engaged in construction. Unexpectedly, the emerging warlords rose and fell repeatedly. The National Government was engaged in suppressing violence and restoring order and failed to proceed smoothly according to the planned steps. It is indeed impossible not to regret it. However, observing the National Government's difficult operation in these five years, it can finally turn misfortune into good fortune. It can be firmly believed that the foundation of the National Government is so solid that it cannot be shaken by one or two clowns. Furthermore, the National Government's efforts in diplomacy have also achieved considerable results, which are gratifying to us. We have learned from the past that no matter how the warlord governments rise and fall, they have passed on the policy of flattery to foreign countries as if they were inherited. Since the establishment of our National Government, the abolition of unequal treaties has been the established policy for foreign countries. In the past few years, such as the revision of new treaties in various countries and the grazing of tariff rights, although the content cannot be said to be a complete victory, the increasing international status of our country is an undeniable fact. We can firmly believe here that the National Government is following this step, and it is not impossible for the Chinese nation to get rid of the oppression of imperialists in a short time. Today, commemorating the establishment of the National Government, we should support the National Government in eliminating the remnants of warlords internally, eliminating reactionary elements, implementing political tutelage and construction, continuing national diplomacy externally, abolishing unequal treaties, and seeking freedom and equality for China. May our revolutionary people pay close attention to it.</p>
<h3 id="e130">North Szechuan Road, Yu Qing Fang <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Negotiations Regarding Water Supply – Residents Suffer from Water Shortage During the Scorching Summer – Three Bureaus Dispatch Personnel to Provide Relief – Yu Qing Fang on North Szechuan Road consists of 186 buildings. Facing North Szechuan Road, there is only one alley entrance; facing Changchun Road, there are five alley entrances. The property belongs to Li Jigao, and it has been using the concession's water and electricity. During the arrival of the Revolutionary Army in Shanghai in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the owner actually bricked up the five alley entrances leading to Changchun Road and requested the Public Concession’s Public Works Department (工部局) police to guard the North Szechuan Road alley entrance. Unexpectedly, the Public Works Department used this as an excuse to forcibly collect police fees from the tenants. Those tenants who resisted had their electricity cut off by the Public Works Department. The tenants were greatly angered and appealed to the former Jiangsu Bureau of Foreign Affairs (江蘇交涉公署), which questioned the Public Works Department. The Public Works Department replied that anyone using the concession's water and electricity should pay the concession police fees. If the Chinese area could supply water and electricity, the fees would not be collected, etc. Upon hearing this, the tenants first broke open two of the bricked-up rear doors and requested the municipal government to station police in the neighborhood for protection, and also requested that the connection to Chinese area water and electricity be expedited. The Public Utilities Bureau (公用局) complied with the unanimous request of the residents and immediately arranged for the installation of water pipes and electric wires. On September 19th of the 17th year of the Republic of China, they, together with the Public Works and Public Safety Bureaus, sent a letter to the property owner requesting them to voluntarily switch over to Chinese area water and electricity. The letter was delivered by the district police to the rental accounting firm. Unexpectedly, both the rental foreign firm and the property owner's residence claimed that the property owner was not in Shanghai and refused to accept it. Subsequently, on October 11th of the 18th year of the Republic of China, the Public Utilities Bureau issued a notice prohibiting residents in the Chinese-concession boundary area from arbitrarily using the concession's water and electricity. Those who had already connected to the concession's water and electricity should immediately switch to Chinese area water and electricity. However, the property owner of the Yu Qing Fang still ignored it. On March 10th of the 19th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Waterworks Company (上海自來水公司) planned to move the water meter originally located at the Changchun Road entrance to the North Szechuan Road entrance, and submitted a road excavation permit request to the Public Utilities Bureau. The bureau deemed this action to be completely unreasonable and denied the request. However, several days later, the company arbitrarily started excavating the road on the North Szechuan Road sidewalk, cut off the pipes, and installed the meter. The residents of Yu Qing Fang, due to the sudden interruption of water supply, requested relief from the Fifth Branch, First Precinct of the Public Safety Bureau (公安局五區一所). The branch dispatched police to persuade them to stop work and restore the water supply. Last Saturday (June 28th), at 2:00 PM, the Public Utilities Bureau suddenly received a letter from the Public Concession’s Public Works Department, stating that they would start work on installing water pipes in front of Yu Qing Fang starting at 8:00 AM this Monday (yesterday), and claiming that the North Szechuan Road sidewalk belonged to the Public Works Department, requesting that the district police be notified not to interfere, etc. At the same time, the Public Works and Public Safety Bureaus also received the same notice. After consultation among the three bureaus, it was believed that although the water meter was located on the sidewalk, the water pipes entered Yu Qing Fang, which was located in the Chinese area. The Public Works Department's approval of the Shanghai Waterworks Company to cut and install the water meter without the consent of the municipal government was simply allowing the water company to defy the municipal laws. The only way to resist was to cut off the water pipes inside the alley. However, by then it was past the Public Works Department's office hours and there was no way to contact them. They immediately sent a letter via express mail, declaring that they did not recognize this illegal action and hoped that they would cease the operation. At the same time, the Public Safety Bureau notified the Dixwell Road Police Station (狄思威路捕房) by telephone to relay this matter to the directors of the Public Works Department. However, according to the police chief, this matter was entirely the initiative of Mr. Haas, the director of the Public Works Department, who was currently out and could not be contacted. The Public Utilities Bureau, not receiving a satisfactory response, and to prepare for any eventuality, dispatched personnel on Sunday to inform the district precinct and the residents' association of Yu Qing Fang, requesting them to inform the residents to store more water in the evening so that if the Shanghai Waterworks Company shut off the water supply during the installation of the meter the next day, they would have a reserve in case of the heavy water usage during the hot summer. Yesterday, the bureau, together with the Public Works and Public Safety Bureaus, dispatched personnel to Yu Qing Fang at 7:00 AM to observe any actions. At 9:00 AM, the police chief of the Dixwell Road Police Station arrived with seven or eight armed police officers and many workers from the Shanghai Waterworks Company. They first closed the water valve to prepare to cut the pipes and install the meter. Personnel dispatched by the Public Utilities Bureau immediately went forward and politely advised them, saying that the municipal government had a solution and had notified the Public Works Department, and that it would not be too late to take action after receiving a reply from the Public Works Department. However, because the police chief and others were adamant in their views, they could only listen. However, in order to implement the planned measures, they hired workers from the Cleanliness Company (潔麗公司). After they cut off the water pipe under the sidewalk, they also cut off the water pipes inside the alley. At that time, it was exactly 11:00 AM, and the residents were using a lot of water. The public bathhouses (老虎灶) in the area could not meet the demand, and eventually there was not a drop of water left. Preparing to seek help, the personnel dispatched by the Public Utilities Bureau believed that this kind of water shortage in the summer would be detrimental to public safety and sanitation. They immediately notified the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company (閘北水電公司) to send workers to open all of the Taiping Faucets (太平龍頭) along Changchun Road for the residents to use for emergency needs, and also connected the water pipes inside Yu Qing Fang to the Chinese area water pipes on Changchun Road. The installation was completed at 5:00 PM, and water supply was continued. If the property owner could negotiate with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company and switch to their water and electricity, then this case could be resolved from then on.</p>

<p>Labor Strike at Water and Electricity Company – Company Issues Notice – The French Concession Water and Electricity Company posted its fourth notice yesterday, stating that since the labor strike occurred on the 18th, there have been many inconveniences for customers, and they deeply apologize. They have decided to recruit new workers and resume work starting on July 1st, which is hereby announced.</p>
<p>Trade Union Meeting – The trade union reopened a members' meeting at the public sports field outside Ximen at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 400 workers attended, all wearing union badges. Xu Yefu from the Municipal Civil Education Committee attended to provide guidance. Chief Inspector Gao from the Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau led many police officers to patrol the field. The meeting was held under the scorching sun for two hours. After the meeting, the attendees lined up and dispersed at the trade union. The approved motions and the remarks of the representative of the Municipal Civil Education Committee are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>Approved Motions – First, Chairman Xu Amei reported on the company's recent notice and the arrest of two workers by the French police and one worker by the Second Precinct of the Public Safety Bureau the day before yesterday, and asked all workers to discuss the countermeasures. It was unanimously resolved that regarding the arrested workers, a petition should be submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Social Affairs Bureau, and a letter should be sent to Du Yuesheng, a Chinese director in the French Concession, to forward to the French police, requesting their release within two days. Regarding the company's notice of recruiting new workers, all workers should investigate at any time whether any new workers have entered the factory and report to the trade union. It was decided that another members' meeting would be held the day after tomorrow (Wednesday) to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Remarks – Xu Yefu from the Municipal Civil Education Committee made remarks stating that he has represented the Municipal Party Headquarters at your meetings more than once, but today he does not feel very happy because some of the workers in your union cannot absolutely obey the discipline of the strike committee, resulting in conflicts with the workers in the vehicle department in the past two days. It must be known that the reason why the vehicle workers cannot fight on the same front is because of the timing and circumstances, and we must not obstruct traffic because of momentary impatience. Therefore, he hopes that all workers will unite and fight together under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang, and especially pay attention to strike discipline and not take any actions that go beyond the bounds, so that they will surely win the final victory.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Dispute – Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, all the workers were marching in an orderly fashion from the trade union on Luban Road to the public sports field in the east to hold a meeting. When passing the intersection of Xieqiao Linin Road, a French Concession Route 6 streetcar, No. 18, was coming from the north and drove into the Chinese area. Because the driver sped up the car in an attempt to scatter the workers, the crowd on the road and some of the workers were extremely indignant and went forward to argue with the driver, but it was ineffective, which led to a conflict. Several pieces of glass on the car were broken. The police on duty rushed to suppress the situation, and the ticket seller Liu Bingting and the cart pusher Wang Xinbao were injured by stones and sent to Guangci Hospital on Jinshenfu Road by Chief Inspector Gao of the Second Precinct of the Municipal Public Safety Bureau. It was heard that one of the workers, Zhu Guangde, had his leg hit by the car at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Foreign Silver Imports Disappear <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The main reason for the drastic fall in silver prices is the excessive import of foreign silver, which has led to supply exceeding demand, resulting in a daily increase in silver reserves and a drastic fall in prices. Since the customs authorities ordered the prohibition of foreign silver imports, Hong Kong still allows imports, so the source of foreign silver has not been completely eliminated. Last week, Hong Kong also banned the import of silver dollars, and this port has also intensified the crackdown, so those engaged in this business have no way to smuggle them in, and as a result, they have disappeared. According to a survey yesterday, not a trace of foreign silver or silver dollars were imported in the past week. The total number of silver ingots transported from this port to other ports such as Hangzhou, Hong Kong, and Mumbai is estimated to be more than 2,070, so the amount of silver reserves in this port is decreasing day by day.</p>

<p>Gold Bar Shipments to the United States Statistics – Total for May – According to the United States Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday, the total value of gold bars and cash exported from China (including Hong Kong) to the United States in May totaled US$434,351. The total from January to May of this year is US$9,833,105.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Low-Priced Rice <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Sold at a Low Price of Three Yuan per Shi – Actively Continuing to Raise Funds – Preparing for Losses in Low-Priced Rice – The Municipal Rice Price Stabilization Committee, due to the recent tension in the rice market, held its sixth meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau at 2:00 PM on June 26th. The attending committee members included Yao Zirang, Zhu Zixiang, Yan Xiaoquan, Cai Yukun, Wang Boxun, Xu Fu (represented by Xu Fengzao), Tang Naikang (represented by Zhang Yinhuai), Mo Zijing, Gu Xinyi, Lu Wenshao, Fan Hesheng, Huang Hanzhi, Pan Gongzhan, and more than ten other people. Committee Chairman Pan presided over the meeting. The following are the important resolutions of the meeting: (1) As rice prices rise and sales of low-priced rice increase sharply, the committee's rice reserves are running low. How should we find ways to maintain the supply? It was resolved to adopt two measures: 1. The purchasing committee members should first contact rice merchants. If the current rice stock is sold out and new rice cannot be supplied, the rice should be borrowed from the merchants and returned as soon as the goods arrive. 2. As fundraising is difficult, the low-priced rice is priced too far below market prices, which will be difficult to sustain. It was resolved that the selling price will be set at 450 copper coins per sheng starting on July 1st, which is still more than three yuan per shi lower than the market price. The Social Affairs Bureau will issue a public notice. (2) Donations have not been enthusiastic, which has made the advance payments difficult. How should we quickly raise funds? It was resolved that the committee should send a letter to the Miscellaneous Grain Association to be responsible for raising donations for low-priced rice, with a minimum of 10,000 yuan. Committee members Ye Huijun and Cai Yukun will be responsible for raising 5,000 yuan to cover the shortfall in the Jiagutang. Committee member Lu Wenshao will allocate 5,000 yuan from the Money Trade Association within this week. Committee member Wang Boxun will ask Mr. Qin Runqing to help raise 20,000 yuan from the Banking Association. The committee will send personnel to collect the funds and the committee members will conduct fundraising from all sectors.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Tianjin Allows Flexible Pickup of Goods <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Pickup Based on Tax Receipts – Yesterday, the shipping companies in this port formally received a telegram from Tianjin stating that the Tianjin Customs will no longer insist on the payment of supplementary taxes for goods shipped from Shanghai for which the import half-tax has already been paid in Shanghai. The flexible measure has also been announced. It is only necessary to send the red receipt for the shipped goods with the vessel and submit the Tianjin Customs half-tax receipt that has been paid to the Jianghai Customs for verification. If it is deemed to be correct, the customers will be allowed to pick up the goods.</p>
<p>Chinese Vessels Temporarily Maintain Transportation – The Chinese vessels in this port originally planned to suspend sailings to Tianjin starting on July 1st to avoid losses from empty voyages. Yesterday, a telegram was received from Tianjin stating that goods from Shanghai will be allowed to be picked up with flexibility, and the Beiyang Gang requested that sailings be maintained as usual to maintain freight transport. Therefore, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinfeng vessel and others will still sail on the Shanghai-Tianjin route today.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Sino-Japanese Nanjing Incident Loss Negotiations <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Cannot Provide Evidence? – The Office of the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai has repeatedly received reports from Japanese residents' associations in Nanjing and Shanghai inquiring about the progress of the negotiations of the Nanjing Incident Loss Investigation Committee and the date of its resolution. Commissioner Shimizu and lawyer Murakami, who are handling this case, are both in Shanghai. Yesterday, Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu convened the commissioners to inquire about everything. Currently, because the commissioners from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs are insisting on justice, the amount of losses claimed by the Japanese side is too large and lacks standards, and they must provide solid evidence. However, the Japanese commissioners claim that the Japanese residents were caught off guard at the time of the incident, and there was no way to collect evidence of losses afterwards. The only way to resolve the issue is for the Japanese commissioners to voluntarily reduce the amount of compensation for the Nanjing Incident losses, which may lead to an earlier resolution. Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu has already telegraphed the Japanese government for instructions.</p>

<p>Practical Measures for Using Domestic Goods – To Be Implemented After Consultation with the Municipal Government – The 22nd meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters discussed the proposal to strictly prohibit party and government personnel from wearing Western-style clothing and should switch to wearing domestic goods to promote them. It was resolved that Committee Member Wang Yansong would be publicly recommended to consult with the Municipal Government on handling the matter. It is heard that Mr. Wang has formulated several practical measures and sent them to the Municipal Government for consideration in order to negotiate and implement them. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Since promoting domestic goods is an urgent task, it must first start with party and government personnel in order to achieve the effect of setting an example and imitating from above. According to the original intention of the proposal from the Second Direct Branch, the following measures are drafted: (1) The Party Headquarters and the government shall each strictly order staff members to use domestic goods and set up a registration office to register foreign clothes made in the past within a time limit, and then affix certificates. However, these foreign clothes with certificates attached may still not be worn at formal gatherings to avoid misunderstanding among the public. (2) Party and government personnel who violate the above order shall be severely punished, and the standard of punishment shall be based on dereliction of duty. (3) The Party and government should jointly announce to all the people's organizations in the city that all staff members should use domestic goods, and the Party Headquarters should send people to inspect them at any time. Those who cannot comply will be given a warning, or their positions will be suspended in severe cases. (4) When the Party and government and various agencies and organizations hold Dr. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week every week, the person in charge must check whether the people in the meeting are actually using domestic goods and constantly admonish them. (5) The best way to punish party and government officials for wearing foreign goods is to set up a drafting committee to draft special rules for approval and implementation. (6) The above measures must be strictly implemented. The above are only some temporary opinions, and I still ask your government to consider them in order to negotiate and implement them. Please accept my sentiments. Shanghaimunicipal government</p>
<h3 id="e150">Domestic Department Store Postpones Opening <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The opening of the China National Products Department Store was originally scheduled for July 1st. Now, due to repeated requests from participating manufacturers who feel that the time is insufficient for the arrangement of various factories, the staff of the preparatory office of the site have also decided to repaint the buildings inside and outside the venue. Therefore, the planned opening date feels really hasty. It has now been decided to postpone the opening to seek perfection. According to a person in the preparatory office, although the opening date has not been set, the various internal procedures are being actively carried out. It is expected that it can be opened in early July to comfort the people of the country.</p>

<p>Telegrams Fight for Concession Telephone Rights – The colleagues of the Capital Telephone Bureau sent a telegram to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, saying: "Dear comrades of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, the auction of the telephone by the Shanghai China and Foreign Telephone Company this time is an attempt to achieve economic aggression by imperialist means, which is extremely harmful to sovereignty and hinders traffic. Since the Ministry of Communications has already negotiated for the recovery, and our colleagues have also telegraphed to the Ministry to vow to fight for it, your bureau is close to the concession and should prepare in advance so that it can eliminate malpractices and improve traffic after receiving it. This matter is of great importance, and we urge you to work hard for it. Capital Telephone Bureau Colleagues bow."</p>
<h3 id="e152">Beginning Today <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Also Bans Silver Imports - Why the Rush of Huge Amounts of Shanghai Silver? - Two Million in Silver Transported to India - After the promulgation of the Shanghai silver ban, foreign silver imported into Shanghai could no longer be unloaded in Shanghai and was mostly transferred to Hong Kong. Recently, the Hong Kong authorities issued an order banning the import of Mexican silver dollars. However, Yuan head coins could still be transported there. Yesterday, banks and shipping companies in Shanghai received another telegram from Hong Kong stating that from July 1st, both silver bars and coins would be completely banned from being landed. The various reports heard are recorded below:</p>
<p>Rushing to Transport National Currency - Since the Hong Kong government announced the ban on Mexican silver dollars and limited each person to bringing no more than fifty dollars into the country, exchange houses in Shanghai changed to purchasing Yuan silver coins for transport to Hong Kong. Since last week, news came that Hong Kong merchants telegraphed saying that from the 7th, the Hong Kong authorities would also ban Yuan coins from entering. A group of Hakka people purchasing foreign rice began buying large quantities of Yuan coins in Shanghai from June 23rd, entrusting European and American postal ships to transport them to Hong Kong. Each ship was loaded with up to one million dollars to Hong Kong. The most transported was last week, stopping only on the day the report was filed. Even if Shanghai allows exports from today, unloading will not be allowed upon arrival in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Refusal to Unload Large Bars - Large bars of American silver transported to Shanghai were rerouted to Hong Kong for temporary storage after being banned from being unloaded in Shanghai last month, in order to find ways to transport them into the interior. Yesterday, reliable information was received that the Hong Kong government no longer allows the unloading of American silver in Hong Kong. The banks decided to reroute the unloading to Singapore for storage. For example, the 789 American silver bars transported to Shanghai by a certain American ship the day before yesterday were rejected by the Jianghai Customs and have now been reloaded on the original ship and sent to Singapore.</p>
<p>Huge Amounts of Silver Rushed Out - Yesterday, a major British bank in Shanghai, in response to the implementation of the Hong Kong ban order on July 1st, rushed to declare a large quantity of silver bars, totaling 2,039 bars, for export yesterday so that they could be transported on the closing ship of June 30th and unloaded upon arrival in Hong Kong. The bank completed the formalities at 2 PM and transferred the silver to a connecting ship on the Bund of Hankou Road. This is the last batch of large silver bars from Shanghai to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Shipping Silver to India - Shanghai has an excess of silver reserves. In order to adjust the financial situation, the banks previously shipped 4,000 large silver bars to India. Today, a second batch of silver is being exported, also to Calcutta, India, totaling a huge amount of 1.94 million taels. Another 20 boxes are being shipped to Singapore. The silver was loaded onto the ship at the Customs Wharf yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Refusing to Sign the Pledge</p>
<p>The Pudong Yanpu meat industry previously stopped operating due to the inconvenience of slaughtering. Fortunately, the municipal government allowed the establishment of a temporary slaughtering operation at Yangjiadu. Complying with the order to open and operate could have been the end of the matter. Now the Health Bureau has issued an order requiring all meat operators to sign a pledge within seven days. This has caused widespread surprise, as everyone thought that the municipal government's permission was convenient. If they sign the pledge, it would be restrictive, so they unanimously refused. Without a reason to sign the pledge, they gathered at the representative's house yesterday to blame each other, suspecting that the three representatives, Hu, Ye, and Tang, were secretly manipulating things. It is heard that the representative has requested instructions from the authorities.</p>

<p>Xu Xiuting and Lin Zhengtang of the Nanyang Bridge business community in the French Concession, in view of the summer epidemic and the need to benefit the poor and sick, specially established a free clinic at the original site of the former Nanyang Bridge Business Community Association, divided into Chinese and Western medicine departments, and hired famous doctors such as Chinese medicine practitioners Zhang Zhiming, Chen Shimei, Chen Queqing, and Western medicine practitioners Ouyang Jixuan and Zhu Jusheng to diagnose and treat patients daily without charging a fee.

<h3 id="e162">Business Prohibition Bureau Seriously Handles Trademark Exclusive Rights <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Trademark Bureau approved the presentation of Xi Yuchang, the lawyer representing Delong Cigarette Factory, stating: "It is known that the trademark of the business, the Flag Beauty brand, has a picture of a half-length woman facing to the left, with a flower in her black hair, wearing a deep blue dress and a light blue vest. The background is a golden convex shape with red and blue dotted lace on both sides. Outside the lace is a golden flower pattern in the shape of a peacock tail, surrounded by a swastika frame, in which a line of red Western characters is written. There are other characters at the top and bottom (the pattern on the back is very complicated, so I won't list them here). The steel seal pattern printed on the cigarette sticks is a full-length light blue half-length woman without flowers in her left hair, surrounded by a golden flower pattern of similar shape in an oval circle, with blue and golden Western characters written in a line below. Compared with the original picture of the registered trademark of the Flag Beauty brand of the business, they are very different. However, at first glance, it is almost the same as the Beautiful brand joint trademark registered by Huacheng Tobacco Company. Therefore, when Huacheng Tobacco Company applied for banning, the bureau immediately ordered the business to quickly delete it. However, the business made a big announcement, claiming that the steel seal pattern on the cigarette sticks was made according to the registered trademark. Now, we are about to issue a strict order to inquire. According to the presentation and defense, in addition to sophistry and strong arguments that the steel seal pattern is not similar to the Beautiful brand of Huacheng Tobacco Company, it also said that there is no difference between the woman in the steel seal pattern and the registered trademark of the Flag Beauty brand. The business stated on one hand that the steel seal pattern was made according to the registered trademark of the Flag Beauty brand, and on the other hand, said that there was no difference from the registered trademark of the Flag Beauty brand. The business has already changed the pattern of its registered trademark to imitate and use it. According to Article 19, Paragraph 1 of the Trademark Law, it should be revoked immediately. Now, in accordance with the provisions of Paragraph 3 of the same article, the Trademark Bureau's punishment of revocation specified in Paragraph 1 should be notified to the trademark exclusive right holder or its agent sixty days in advance.

<h3 id="e166">Huang and Lu are in Love <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Lu Genrong Declared Not Guilty</p>
<p>Lu Genrong Temporarily Still Detained</p>
<p>Release Must Wait for Confirmation</p>
<p>The case of Huang and Lu's love affair has been widely publicized in society. The issue of Lu Genrong's two criminal charges of seduction and theft has been appealed to the Supreme Court twice, and the re-trial procedures have been quite complicated. It was not until yesterday (30th) that he was declared not guilty. Lu has been detained since June 23rd of the lunar calendar in the summer of 1928. Later, the Wuxian Local Court sentenced him to two years for seduction. His lover, Huang Huiru, stated that the love between the two was with her consent. According to the new law, Lu had no reason to be convicted. She stayed in Wuxia and hired lawyer Song Mingxun to appeal to the High Court. Unexpectedly, the High Court changed the sentence to four years for the crime of intending to commit adultery and abduction. Later, he again ran around trying to appeal to the Supreme Court. As a result, Lu was changed to the crime of aiding and abetting theft, with a sentence of two years. At that time, Huang suddenly died of postpartum depression, extinguishing her beauty. If Huiru is dead, Genrong finally achieved the goal of being declared not guilty. Huiru, if she knew in the afterlife, would be able to rest in peace. However, even if Lu's freedom is restored, he should have a feeling that a beauty will not return. Yesterday (30th) at 2 PM, Zhao Zhengdang, the acting presiding judge of the Criminal Third Court of the High Court, accompanied by judges Fang Wen and Zheng Zhiguo, prosecutor Jin Henian, and secretary Yi Xuheng, ascended the seat in the first courtroom. As usual, they asked for names and ages and then announced the main text of the judgment: "In the case of Lu Genrong of Wuxian appealing against the theft, the part of the judgment concerning Lu Genrong's crime of theft is revoked. Lu Genrong is not guilty of the part of the theft charged." He also instructed that after his release from prison this time, he must be law-abiding and not do evil. Lu Genrong requested to be released on bail in court. Judge Zhao replied that he would wait until the case file was sent to the Prosecutor's Office. If the prosecutor does not appeal, he can be released, it is said. After the ruling, Lu was returned to custody. At that time, Lu's father, Huiqing, and Lu's cousin, Tang Yixian, went to the former Wuxian Third Prison Branch to visit Lu Genrong. He has been in custody for two years and has been in contact with other criminals, and he is full of new terms, it is said. Yesterday's debate concluded.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Liu Siqiao's Tragic Death Case <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Complete Despair of Reconciliation Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>Pan Shiju Denies Negligence</p>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the Morning of the 5th</p>
<p>Pan Shiju, the son of Pan, the compradore of the Bureau of Works, drove his newly purchased car at high speed on the Great West Road on April 7th and crashed into Dr. Liu Siqiao, killing him. Liu's wife, Li, hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to first sue him for murder in the Special District Local Court, and then withdrew the lawsuit and filed a civil lawsuit requesting Pan Shiju to compensate for the loss of 60,000 yuan. The summons and order to go out for reconciliation have been recorded in this newspaper. However, although Pan Shiju killed Liu in the crash, he denied that it was his fault, resulting in complete despair of reconciliation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong continued the trial. The defendant presented two witnesses, one was Pan's chauffeur, Wang A'bao, and the other was Zhu Hesheng, the rickshaw puller of the rickshaw Liu was riding at the time. The testimony was unfavorable to the plaintiff, saying that if Liu Siqiao had jumped off the north side of the rickshaw he was riding in, he would not have been hit by the car. However, he jumped off from the south side, resulting in the disaster, and so on. Then the debate began. According to the plaintiff's lawyer, Jiang Yiping, if the defendant's car had not hit the rickshaw Liu was riding in and shaken Liu out of the car, Liu would never have jumped out of the rickshaw by himself. Even if Liu jumped out by himself, if the defendant's car had not been speeding and chasing the car in front, causing him to take the wrong route and hit Liu's car, Liu would not have jumped out. Therefore, the defendant's responsibility for negligence is difficult to shirk. Today's two witnesses, one is the defendant's own chauffeur, who will naturally protect his master, and the other is the rickshaw puller of the deceased, but his rickshaw was damaged in the crash and repaired by the defendant. Therefore, this person's testimony is not directly bought with money, but indirectly has a financial relationship, so it is not worth trusting. The defendant's car is insured and his family is rich. The amount of compensation requested by the plaintiff is well within his ability to bear. The deceased's average monthly income was 800 yuan, and he was only over 30 years old. Calculating with a lifespan of 60 years, the loss is not extravagant. The defendant Pan Shiju's two lawyers replied that the negligence was on Liu Siqiao's part and said that if the defendant must be found to have negligence and the amount of compensation, it cannot be as the plaintiff requested. They also cited the recent case of Shen Pengnian, the former Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, being killed by a car as a ratio, saying that the driver in that case should bear more responsibility for negligence than in this case, and the result was only an order to compensate about 6,000 yuan. The judge then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of July 5th.</p>
<h3 id="e168">Wu Jian Guang and Others Accused <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Plaintiff Yu Qingyu presented substantial evidence, accusing Wu and others of using deceptive words to confuse the public and obtain money through fraud. In Shanghai, those who engage in divination and astrology are as numerous as the stars in the Ganges River, but the most renowned are Wu Jianguang, Chai Wenzhong, Wang Yonghai, and Wang Zhenhai. Among them, Wu is particularly known for his extensive supernatural powers, rarely matched. However, there has never been any instance of requesting their prohibition. Now, like a thunderclap, these four individuals are jointly accused of using deceptive words to confuse the public and obtain money through fraud. The plaintiff requests the Special District Local Court to shut them down, summon them for questioning, and impose penalties. The plaintiff is Yu Qingyu, a standing committee member of the Second District Tenth Branch. His complaint is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Complaint Content: It has long been prohibited to use superstition to harm people, but unexpectedly, under this clear and bright sky, there are blind people assuming the role of fortune-telling houses, defrauding women of large sums of money. The facts are recorded below: (1) Blind people establish fortune-telling houses using their status as disabled individuals, and their fortune-telling and divination are not too excessive, so although it is known that they use superstition to confuse people, strict prohibitions have not been imposed. Initially, it was not expected that there would be such a significant hidden agenda. (2) The hidden agenda of the blind people: Whenever women come to them for fortune-telling, they inquire about their addresses and family situations. If men or women are having affairs, they say they are afflicted by the "Peach Blossom Star"; if they have no children, they say they are afflicted by the "Heavenly Dog Star"; if they are losing property, they say they are afflicted by the "White Tiger Star"; if they are sick, they say they are afflicted by the "Mourning Gate Star," "Hanging Guest Star," or "Hemp-Wearing Star." Women who fall for their tricks are then ordered to hire a number of Taoist priests to perform rituals using various fake talismans, stepping on the Big Dipper formation, and striking gongs and cymbals. The cost for one day is as high as hundreds of gold pieces, or at least dozens of yuan. Wu Jianguang on Nanjing Road, Chai Wenzhong on North Nicheng Bridge (after Wenzhong's death, his two sons Chai Caifa and Chai Caigao took over), Wang Yonghai, and Wang Zhenhai on South Chengda Lane each earn hundreds or thousands of yuan daily, which outsiders are unaware of. (3) Initially, party members thought that as disabled individuals, they should be given some leeway until the government can help them solve their food, clothing, and housing problems. However, they have become increasingly brazen, so it was necessary to go undercover and obtain evidence of Chai Wenzhong and others defrauding with the blind people using明眼人 (people who can see) for sixteen yuan and six jiao, and evidence of employing blind people to set up scams for one hundred and seventy-six yuan. In addition to the resolution by the Ninth Executive Committee of the Second District Tenth Branch to submit a request to the higher authorities to consult with the Chinese and foreign concessions to strictly prohibit them, a lawsuit is also filed with your court to recover the losses from the fraud and punish them according to the law. (Reason) Using deceptive words to confuse the public and obtain money through fraud is a violation of specific laws. It is the duty of this party to eliminate superstition and absolutely not allow these people to engage in deception and fraud again, bringing shame to the party's rule and the community. (Objective) Please arrest the defendants and reserve the right for the victims to file private lawsuits. Please also announce within the territory that if the above circumstances are encountered, the public may report, arrest, and send them to court at any time to eliminate superstition and prevent them from falling into their tricks again.</p>
<p>Court's Interrogation: Upon receiving the complaint, the court immediately issued summonses to the defendants Wu Jianguang and others, ordering them to appear in court for questioning in the past few days. After receiving the summonses, only Wang Yonghai hired a lawyer to argue that he was forced to make a living in this way, and that there are hundreds of people in Shanghai who do this, and even foreigners in Shanghai who engage in mentalism and palmistry. Why not prosecute them one by one? Furthermore, bookstores sell books on astrology, feng shui, and talismans, all of which are forms of superstition. Incense offerings and prayers are not prohibited in temples and Taoist monasteries. Why is there preferential treatment? The plaintiff filed a public lawsuit because Taoist He Yaokun reported them out of personal grudges, which is discriminatory. Furthermore, the plaintiff is a loyal party member and could have openly prohibited them. Why did they have to go undercover and lie, using deceptive means to make people fall into error? This is akin to punishing without prior instruction. He requests that the case be dismissed and reserves the right to file a private lawsuit for the defendants' losses. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the court. Wu Jianguang claimed illness and did not attend, sending lawyer Ye Fikang as his representative. Only the two Wangs appeared in court, and the Chai brothers did not attend. Judge Feng first interrogated Yu Qingyu, who stated that Wang Wenhai was a fortune-teller hired by Chai Caifa and Caigao. Then, lawyer Ye stated that the part of the complaint against Wu Jianguang did not specify the legal articles or how the fraud was committed. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that the prosecution was based on Article 363 of the Criminal Law. Yu then stated that on June 13, he went to Chai Wenzhong's fortune-telling house, pretending that a Mr. Chen was ill and had come for divination. Wang Yonghai performed the divination, and the result was very ominous. When asked if there was a way to perform a ritual to ward off the evil, Wang said that it would require two days of prayer and a cost of one hundred and sixty yuan. He was asked to open an account, and he immediately demanded sixteen yuan, which was given to him. Wang Zhenhai specializes in selling fake scriptures. His wife once bought the "Five Thunder Gods Mantra" and other scriptures from him, costing five yuan. Last year, his wife went to Wu Jianguang for divination because she had no children. Wu said that he was afflicted by the "Heavenly Dog Star" and that the child had been eaten. He said that a ritual must be performed to have a chance of having children. The method of performing the ritual was to conduct a Taoist ceremony for one day, and he told his wife not to let him know. His wife was fooled and spent one hundred and thirty-four yuan to conduct a Taoist ceremony for one day and obtained a paper talisman to ward off evil in the house. He only found out about this now. Wang Yonghai denied receiving sixteen yuan from the plaintiff. Wang Zhen also stated that he did not sell scriptures. Judge Feng then adjourned the hearing to a later date at Rue Massenet.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Terrifying Male Corpse <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>A letter to the police was found near the corpse, stating that the deceased was Zhang Mingguen. It appears to be a case of murder due to uneven distribution of spoils.</p>
<p>At around 2:30 AM yesterday morning, a patrol officer of the French Concession Police Department discovered an unidentified male corpse lying in a pool of blood on the roadside in front of a foreign house at No. 41 Rue Massenet. The officer immediately reported to the Chief of the French Concession Police Department in Lujiawan, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. The deceased was found to be approximately thirty years old, with a long face, a monk's bald head, no hat, wearing a white cotton short shirt and trousers with a white dirty shirt underneath, a white silk waistband, light gray silk socks, and black leather shoes. He had three gold teeth inlaid in his mouth. He had been shot twice, one bullet entering from the outer end of the left eyebrow and penetrating the back of the head, and the other entering from below the right rib under the nipple and lodging in the back without penetrating. A letter was found in his chest pocket with "To the Police Department" written on the envelope, specifying the deceased's name as Zhang Mingguen. It was from this that the deceased's name was known (this letter appeared to have been inserted by the murderer after Zhang was killed). According to the investigation by the detectives, residents nearby reported that a car was seen passing by around 1:30 AM, followed by several gunshots. However, they did not know any details. The detectives took the letter back to the police station to report to the chief, who then notified Tongren Fuyuantang to send undertakers to carry the body to the coroner's office. No belongings of the deceased were found. Yesterday morning, the police department sent someone to the coroner's office to photograph the body, and a lead bullet was found protruding from the back of the body, with the bullet head flattened. The detective took it to the police department for storage. Subsequently, the Criminal Division reported to the French Court, and Judge Zhu Cheng arrived at the coroner's office at 11:30 AM at noon to conduct the examination. He sat in the official position, and the detectives reported the previous situation and presented the letter and lead bullet. After reviewing the evidence, Judge Zhu determined that the deceased had indeed been shot to death. Since no belongings of the deceased were found, Tongren Fuyuantang was ordered to prepare a coffin for burial and placement in the altar, awaiting family members to claim the body and awaiting the police department to arrest the murderer for interrogation. According to general speculation at the time, it was said that it was probably a case of internal conflict and killing among comrades due to uneven distribution of spoils, resulting in extreme poverty.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Jing Fengxiang Attempts Suicide in Pudong <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Money is exhausted, resources are depleted. Unable to make a living, it's too tragic.</p>
<p>At around 7 PM the night before last, the No. 4 ferry at Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong loaded over twenty passengers at the New Customs Wharf on the opposite bank and sailed back to Pudong. Unexpectedly, when the boat reached the center of the river, a middle-aged man took advantage of others' inattention and suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, he was rescued by the crew and did not drown. The captain, Qian Zhisheng, immediately sent him to the Water Police Station. According to his statement, his name is Jing Fengxiang, thirty years old, from Shaoxing, currently residing at No. 147, Lane 6, Zhen'anli, Gonghe Road, Zhabei. He has joined the Chinese Nationalist Party as a member, and his party certificate number is Zhe No. 5323. In 1925, he worked as a messenger in the Shaoxing Police Bureau in Zhejiang for quite some time. In February 1927, when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Zhejiang, he worked as an assistant in the dispatch office of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters. In June 1929, he lost his job and brought his wife to Shanghai with the intention of seeking other employment. Later, he met a friend surnamed Xu, who was a bodyguard for someone in the French Concession. He asked Xu to find him any job to make a living temporarily. Unfortunately, his luck was not good, and Xu's older sister suddenly passed away in his hometown. Xu immediately returned home to attend the funeral and did not return to Shanghai until October of that year. Because it had been too long, he was fired by his employer and could no longer take care of his employment problem, causing the couple to wander around until now. All his savings have been completely exhausted. Even the several sets of Western-style clothes that he brought to Shanghai have been pawned. He has exhausted all means and has no way to think. On June 26th of this month, his friend Cao Jingui mentioned that the Public Security Bureau was recruiting police officers for the Fifth Squadron. He went to apply for the examination, and his eyesight, hearing, strength, and physical examination were all rated as A. Later, for the written test, he still remembered one question: "Why are you taking this exam?" He answered, "We are taking the exam to seek the happiness of the Party and the country for the country, to protect the security of the local people and business community for the people, and to seek a place to live for ourselves." Many of the examinees did not know how to read, so he helped them answer. The results of the examination showed that he could not find a guarantor to provide a guarantee, so he could not find a job. Seeing others being selected one after another, he did not get his wish. The most painful thing was that when he went to take the exam, he still borrowed one yuan from a friend, saying that it would be used as capital for doing a small business. Now the money has been used up, and he really has no face to see his friend. He is currently facing the end of his resources and has no choice but to commit suicide by jumping into the river. His words were so tragic that one could not bear to hear them. The police chief comforted him with a few words and ordered the detectives to bring his wife, Ms. Chen, to take him home that night.</p>

This case has been repeatedly investigated by the local court and has reached its final debate. Yesterday, Judge Deng pronounced Hou Genbao guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced him to death. Hou Genbao declared in court that he did not accept the verdict. The judge ordered him to appeal to the High Court within ten days and ordered him to be returned to custody.</p>

<p>Parisian Dancer Huang Baiying</p>
<h3 id="e172">The Truth About Suicide <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Paris dance hall on Jing'an Temple Road moved its business to West Shanghai due to the summer heat. A dancer named Huang Baiying suddenly committed suicide by swallowing sleeping pills the other day. The situation was briefly reported previously, but the truth was not clear. Now, after a detailed investigation by reporters, the truth has been revealed as follows:</p>
<p>Dancer's Family Background: Huang Baiying is from Guangdong, and is currently nineteen years old. Huang was originally from a wealthy family and studied at a university in Guangdong, excelling in calligraphy and literature. However, her father was not good at managing the business, and the family's fortunes declined. When she was sixteen years old, her parents passed away one after another. Baiying was lonely and helpless, and had few siblings, resulting in the bankruptcy of the entire family. Because it was difficult for a lone girl to maintain a living in her hometown, a relative took her to Shanghai, seeing her beauty, and she lived with a friend. She then learned to dance and entered the Great Eastern as a low-ranking dancer. Because of her gentle nature, she got along well with her colleagues.</p>
<p>A Flower Fallen into the Mire: After Huang Baiying became a dancer at the Great Eastern, she devoted herself to studying dance. However, modern dance halls are opportunities for good girls to fall. Baiying, influenced by what she saw and heard, had to transform from a dignified woman into a charming and seductive figure. At this time, a dance patron named Tong Sanmao, nicknamed "Long-legged Tong," saw Baiying's beauty and wanted to take a bite of forbidden fruit. He planned to seduce her. Huang, as a dancer, had no status to speak of and willingly complied.</p>
<p>Love in the Battlefield: Tong Sanmao was the young owner of a candy company in Tilanqiao, Hongkou. However, he liked to indulge in pleasure and willingly associated with degenerate people. As a result, his father and brother did not pay attention to him and allowed him to mess around outside. Baiying was favored by Tong Sanmao, but women are mostly fickle. Over time, she became tired of him. In addition, Tong often acted like he was her husband, and there were often arguments. The manager of the Great Eastern saw that Baiying had this affair and that it was not good for the overall situation, so he wanted to suspend her dance business. This was learned by the Paris dance hall, which recruited her as their own.</p>
<p>Turmoil in the Sea of Jealousy: After the dancer Huang Baiying joined Paris, her love with Tong slightly diminished. A college student named Zhang often came to Paris to dance. Seeing that Baiying was skilled in dancing and knowing that she understood English and spoke it fluently while embracing her, he considered her to be his soulmate in the dance hall. This news reached Tong's ears, inevitably arousing his jealousy, regarding Zhang as his rival. He then spread defamatory words in front of the crowd, insisting that Baiying must marry him.</p>
<p>Rivals Meet: Zhang, since falling in love with the dancer Baiying, frequented Paris every night, greatly enjoying himself. Tong knew about their secret actions, so on the evening of the 28th, he also went to the Paris dance hall. Baiying greeted him. Zhang, seeing Tong, feared that he would be unfavorable to him, so he slipped away after a while. Zhang's friend Fang knew the inside story and wanted to mediate between the two, asking Baiying to dance with Tong several times. The three sat at the same table, talking about other things. When the dance was over and the hall was dismissed, Fang invited Tong and Baiying to go out together.</p>
<p>Forced Killing in a Hotel: Baiying knew that Tong had bad intentions, but her claims were of no avail. She told Ge Songxian, the assistant manager of Paris, that Tong and Fang had invited her to go out, and she didn't know if she could go. Ge, not knowing the details, replied that there was no danger and she could go. Baiying then boarded a car with them, heading straight to Wusong for a ride. When they reached Wusong, Tong took out a metal rod from the car, intending to hit Fang. Fang also argued strongly. Tong then drove the car back to Shanghai, dropping Fang off in the middle of Baek Road. He then went straight to the Cangzhou Hotel in West Shanghai, opening another room. After closing the door, he took out a package of sleeping pills, ordering Baiying to swallow them, saying that if Baiying wanted to love Zhang, he would deal with her in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p>Poisoning En Route: Baiying, at this critical moment, was like Wang Lianying, and Tong insisted that she write a letter to Zhang to cut off their relationship. Baiying had no choice but to swallow twelve sleeping pills. Tong, knowing that she had taken poison, feared that it would implicate him, and that his name would be written on the record of the incident. At this time, he immediately took Baiying out, intending to go to Baiying's residence at No. 65 Wanli Lane, Lafayette Road, in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, the poison had already taken effect en route. Tong then sent Baiying to the Baolong Hospital by rickshaw. After several diagnoses by the doctor, she is now able to speak a little. There are fears that Huang and Fang will propose serious charges. Baek Road</p>

The gambling equipment and all the assets in the gambling den were confiscated.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Female Student Attempts Suicide at Sea <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Firmly refuses to reveal her real name.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock, a female student, speaking with a local accent, approximately sixteen years old, with a pretty appearance, fashionable clothing, and a sorrowful expression, walked to the shore in front of the flagpole of the Baotai Customs House, holding a bundle of newspapers. She first threw the newspapers into the sea. At that time, customs flagmen and others along the coast noticed her suspicious behavior and paid attention to her. They then saw the female student trying to jump into the sea, and they immediately rushed forward to stop her, preventing the female student from fulfilling her wish. When the crowd went forward to inquire, the female student denied everything and questioned the crowd for falsely accusing her. She was eloquent and composed, unlike a young and weak woman. At that time, a patrolling police officer from the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau saw this and questioned her about her name and origin, but she firmly refused to reveal anything. Because he observed that she had infinite worries between her eyebrows, he immediately brought her to the district, where the patrol chief and others repeatedly questioned her, but she still refused to reveal her name and origin. Therefore, he reported to District Chief Yang, who personally inquired, but she refused to explain. Therefore, District Chief Yang, unable to take action, could only persuade her with kind words and carefully counsel her before ordering her to go home on her own, lest her family be worried. The female student immediately agreed and left. Xu Funian</p>

<p>Han Fuguo shouldn't enter other people's homes.</p>
<p>The verdict is that he will be detained in the West Prison for one month.</p>
<p>Han Fuguo, from Jiangbei, came to Shanghai from his hometown with his wife Wu in the year before last to make a living. They lived together in the Zhabei area. Han worked outside, and Wu did sewing outside. The poor couple depended on each other, lived a hard life, and their relationship was still relatively harmonious. Initially, they lived in peace with no differences. Unexpectedly, starting last year, Han became lazy and unemployed, relying on his wife's needlework to make a living, and often asked Wu for money to use. If he was not satisfied, he would beat and scold her. As a result, the two developed animosity, and Wu regretted marrying him. She became familiar with Xu Funian (who works as a ticket collector at the Albert Road Powerball Stadium) from Yangzhou and eloped with him in September of last year, living with Xu in a pavilion-style building at No. 3 Shenshengli, Qianjiatang, in the French Concession, living like husband and wife. However, the secret was discovered by Han Fuguo, who, on the morning of the 24th of last month, brought a crowd to the place to catch them in the act. Wu heard the sound and woke Xu up, and she fled to the home of a Zhang family next door to take refuge. Xu hid in the room of Yan in the front building. Han used a bamboo ladder to climb to the upper floor to search, and then tore open the wall of the front building, intending to enter and catch them in the act before stopping. Xu Funian, with no escape, in a moment of desperation, jumped out of the window, attempting to escape. Unexpectedly, he injured his vital parts and fell to the ground unconscious. The patrolling police officer from 426 arrived and arrested Han, along with Wu, and brought them to the police station. At the same time, the injured person was sent to the hospital. He died due to his serious injuries. The details have been previously recorded. Yesterday, the police station sent all the people involved to the French Court for questioning. First, the police chief reported the previous situation. Han Fuguo confessed that his wife took their one-year-old child out to work as a helper on September 16th of last year and never returned until he saw a civilian in the vegetable market a few days ago. He followed her and learned that she was living with the deceased in Shenshengli. Therefore, he went to call his wife home in the morning. He didn't know how Xu Funian, feeling guilty, jumped out of the window, and it wasn't because he was forced by the civilian to seek forgiveness. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced the defendant Han Fuguo for improperly entering other people's residences and ordered him to be detained in the West Prison for one month as a warning to Wu and released Xu.</p>

After the witness was summoned to testify, the judge determined that the debate was over and scheduled the verdict for the 20th and 30th. Li Zhonghua had strong suspicions regarding the threatening letter and was sentenced to the prosecutor's office for preliminary review and custody. Jin Shunchang and Gu Guoan were ordered to leave the court to await the verdict. The details have been previously recorded. Now it is learned that the case reached the date of the verdict yesterday.

<p>Restaurant owner beaten by mob</p>
<p>The Xieyuguan Restaurant, recently opened on Oujia Road, Shanghai East, had its opening day (the 27th) the day before yesterday and was doing quite well. The next day at noon, a customer who looked like a ruffian entered the restaurant and took a seat. Cai Changfu, a waiter, thirty-four years old from Pudong, went forward to greet the customer attentively. The customer said to Cai that he needed two pieces of "miao rou" (a type of meat). After a short time, the meat was cooked and placed on the table. After inspecting it carefully, the customer complained that the meat was too fatty and needed to be replaced. Cai replied that there was no lean meat. The customer's face showed displeasure, and he threw the bowl on the table and left in a hurry. Cai, because the new store had just opened, wanted to settle the matter to avoid trouble and did not argue with him. Unexpectedly, at 8:30 PM last night, the customer led seven or eight tough-looking people, armed with axes, into the Xieyuguan without asking any questions. One person raised an axe and struck Cai Changfu on the head. Fortunately, Cai was very strong and used his right hand to block the axe, injuring his left wrist and causing blood to flow like a river. The others swarmed forward and started fighting. Cai also resisted despite his injuries, and his head was injured by a stool. A brawl ensued, with cups and plates scattered everywhere. Then, colleagues went out to call the police on duty, and the thugs scattered like birds and beasts. The main offender was arrested by the police and taken to the Third Sub-District of the Fifth District for investigation. The injured person was sent to Tongren Hospital by car for treatment.</p>

<p>Lin Bing, fifteen years old from Taizhou, was an apprentice at a cake shop at the intersection of Zhongzhou Road and Qiujiang Road in Zhabei. Yesterday afternoon around 3 or 4 PM, he and another apprentice named Wu Xiaosi took a basket to the market to sell. Soon after, they passed near the Second White Ferry Bridge on North Suzhou Road.

Lin ran to the dock to relieve himself, and accidentally lost his footing and fell into the river. In an instant, he tragically drowned. Wu, seeing him fall into the river, was frightened and shouted for help. A patrol officer heard the news and arrived to try to salvage him, but was unsuccessful. More than an hour later, the body floated to the surface of the water.

<p>Cao Zhaosun, twenty-four years old from the local area, residing in the Xizhuhuzhai area of Caojiadu, West Shanghai, worked as a tailor. He lost his parents at a young age and was an orphan with no support. He studied hard and grew up, being diligent and thrifty, and was highly respected by the villagers. In the previous year, he was engaged to a woman surnamed Mou through a matchmaker. Because of financial difficulties, they have not yet completed the marriage. He has been working diligently for two years, and has accumulated some savings. He has now chosen the sixth day of the tenth month of this year to get married. All the betrothal gifts and clothes have been prepared. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning at around 10 AM, Zhaosun, due to the hot weather, went to the nearby Zhuanbang with three or four neighbors to bathe and swim. After half an hour, the three or four neighbors got out of the water and went ashore, returning home in a hurry. They did not pay attention to Cao. After the neighbors arrived home and changed clothes, they realized that Cao had not returned. They immediately returned to the side of the creek and saw that Cao was already floating on the water. They tried their best to salvage him, but he had already drowned and died. His nephew Cao Fugen carried the body back to establish an heir to inherit and prepare a coffin for burial. The villagers nearby all lamented and were saddened by this.</p>

<p>Shu Yongquan, a 46-year-old man from Yin County, has been working as a partner at the Tai Run Bean and Wheat Shop on Doushi Street in the southern part of the city. He lives with his wife, Zhang, at No. 180, Shijia Alley. Shu has a son named Ren Shan, who is 21 years old and not yet married. Shu once asked someone to act as a matchmaker to find him a good partner, but was rejected. As a result, Ren Shan spends his days wandering about, not engaging in proper work. Although his father has repeatedly warned him, he does not listen and dares to disobey and insult him. Shu is extremely angry, but there is nothing he can do with his unruly wife and bad son. Unexpectedly, Ren Shan again asked his mother, Zhang, for money the other day. When his desire was not fulfilled, he immediately started assaulting her, causing Zhang to suffer internal injuries and develop hemoptysis. She was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. When Shu found out, he was filled with anger and went to the first precinct of the first district to report the rebellious son's illegal actions, requesting his arrest. The chief immediately dispatched police to bring Shu Ren Shan to the station for preliminary interrogation. As the matter concerned assaulting a parent, he was ordered to prepare a document for submission to the Third Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Zhou Ziyong Has a Fleeting Affair</p>
<p>Signs a Guarantee to Claim the Body and Provide a Coffin</p>
<p>Zhou Ziyong, the owner of the Qingjie Tang barbershop at No. 334 Guangdong Road, is fond of indulging in pleasure and often associates with lower-class prostitutes. On February 8th of this year, he met a prostitute named Zhou Yinzhu, and their relationship was extremely passionate. Zhou Yinzhu was nineteen years old and had many clients, so she had contracted a severe case of syphilis. After she became involved with Ziyong, she often went to the barbershop to ask for money for medical treatment. Over time, Ziyong became increasingly disgusted with her but could not get rid of her. On the afternoon of the 28th of last month, Yinzhu went to the shop. As soon as she entered, she suddenly collapsed from the poison and died instantly. Ziyong immediately reported it to the Old Gate Police Station, who sent detectives to the scene and took the body to the forensic examination office on Fei Lun Road. Yesterday morning, they reported it to the Shanghai Special District Local Court, which dispatched Prosecutor Xu to the office for an autopsy. It was determined that the prostitute's father was still registered in her hometown but had not arrived.

<p>Liang Shanmei's Courage is Commendable. Liang Shanmei, an assistant proofreader at the Mainland Newspaper and a native of Guangdong, was on his way home from the newspaper office at around 4:00 AM the other morning. As he was walking along Huolun Mill Street in the French Concession, he saw a fellow villager, nicknamed "Old Guangdong," being robbed by a thief. Liang, seeing this injustice, bravely stepped forward to help. The thief immediately fled north to the intersection of Hubei Road and Guangdong Road, where he hid behind the door of a cigarette paper shop. Liang stopped and did not chase, but he had an idea. He took out a lighter box from his pocket, held it in his hand as if it were a gun, and pointed it at the thief, saying, "Come out and surrender, or I will shoot you!" The thief did not answer. Liang then pretended to fire the gun to scare him. The thief raised his hands to show that he dared not resist and surrendered. He did not realize that Liang was tricking him. The thief was later taken to the Songshan Road Police Station by the French police for interrogation. Mr. Fei Woli, the chief inspector of the French Concession Police Department, praised Liang Shanmei for his courage and intelligence in a special letter yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e192">A Record of the Interesting United Graduation Ceremony of Municipal Middle Schools, By Yan Ye <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public and Private Middle Schools held a unified graduation examination starting from the 16th of this month. On the 25th, they held a joint graduation ceremony at the Penglai Grand Theatre in the North City and the Central Auditorium in the South City in the morning and afternoon. The grand occasion has already been reported in the newspapers. I will now record some interesting facts from the Penglai venue for the attention of Juan Weng.</p>
<p>Choosing the Far Over the Near: The venues for the united graduation ceremony were divided into two locations, north and south. The intention must have been for the schools in the South City to go to Penglai, and those in the North City to go to the Central Auditorium. Who knew it would not be so? The distribution method was to have students whose examination paper numbers were within 1200 go to Penglai to participate, and those above 1200 go to the Central Auditorium. The convenience of the students going back and forth, regardless of whether the school was in the north or south, was not considered at all. Therefore, on this day, the front seats were already occupied by students from the South City schools, who were more conveniently located. The students from the North City could only sigh and retreat to the back rows. It is said that the North City students suffered from choosing the far over the near. It was even more painful to arrive and not get a good seat.</p>
<p>Speeches with Different Styles: There were four speakers. Director Chen of the Education Bureau spoke eloquently for almost an hour, giving separate instructions on further education and employment, gesticulating and acting with extreme enthusiasm. The mayor's representative gave a gentle and calm speech, like a teacher lecturing in the classroom, gesticulating naturally. The two representatives of the school principals who delivered speeches, one was Mr. Pang of Junyi, and the other was Ms. Wang Xiaoying of Wuben. Mr. Pang started calmly and then became enthusiastic, like a clear breeze and beautiful sunshine gradually turning into a heavy rain and storm. Ms. Wang was good at Mandarin and long speeches. When she stepped onto the stage, the audience became quieter. She stood tall and upright, with her hands always behind her back. Her voice was clear, and her attitude was calm, giving people the feeling of taking a refreshing medicine after hearing Mr. Pang's enthusiastic and passionate speech.</p>
<p>The Most Enthusiastic Applause for Minli: The number of graduates from Minli was the largest among the schools. When the mayor's representative distributed graduation certificates, representatives from each school went forward to receive them. The applause was weak or even silent for schools with fewer students. When the master of ceremonies called out Minli, there was a burst of applause like thunder, deafening the ears. It was the same for Minli Girls' Middle School. The two schools are actually one and the same, and the brothers and sisters are congratulating each other.</p>
<p>The Honor of Young Fudan: Director Chen gave separate certificates to those who were ranked A in all subjects of the unified examination to encourage them. On this day, the most awardees were students from Youth and Fudan schools. Therefore, the sound of Youth and Fudan students was constantly heard, and the applause was more enthusiastic than when the certificates were given. When a student from Youth received the award, the master of ceremonies shouted that this was the first place in the junior high school unified examination. Everyone paid attention and applauded him. Later, Director Chen suddenly said that the report of the first place was wrong, and that only grades were assessed, not rankings, so there was no such thing as first, second, or third place. Thus, the student's first place was gained and then lost.</p>
<p>The Well-Behaved Bows of Female Students: All those who received certificates and awards had to bow twice to the person giving the award. Many male students bowed properly, but in the end, they were not as good as the female students, who were all respectful, standing straight and bending their bodies at a 90-degree angle. Also, because the female students had short hair, their hair would fall and cover their eyes when they bowed, and they would shake their heads when they stood up, which was also very interesting.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Trivial Records of the Xinghua Temple Fair, By Xu Xiaoting <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Xinghua is a remote area in Jiangbei, and the people's superstitious customs are very strong. Although the national system has been reformed, the custom of welcoming gods and holding temple fairs in the middle of the fifth month of the lunar calendar still persists. The fair lasts for more than ten days, and the people waste time and money more than anything else. Now that the temple fair is approaching again, I will record some trivial news from the fair.</p>
<p>Precious Carvings: There are many rare items in the grand meeting. The most eye-catching is the hollow bamboo umbrella of the Jiangfu Society. The umbrella is hexagonal and completely made of hollow bamboo pieces inlaid together. It is said to have come from a famous craftsman in Jiading. The carvings are exquisite and the patterns are beautiful. At first glance, it looks like fine silk with paintings on it. The umbrella was originally made in ten pieces, but now it has been damaged and lost, leaving only six pieces.</p>
<p>Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth: The gods welcomed at the temple fair are the City God, the Dutian, and the Dragon King. The fair dates are the 12th, 16th, and 20th days of the fifth month of the lunar calendar. The statue of the City God is white-faced, the Dutian is blue-faced, and the Dragon King is red-faced. This year, someone suggested that the City God's procession should be changed from the 12th to the 16th, and the Dutian should be brought forward to the 12th. This way, the three gods' processions would be in accordance with the saying "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth". However, local people followed the old custom, and the City God's date was ultimately not changed.</p>
<p>Competing for Novelty and Winning: The most eye-catching thing at the temple fair is the open-air sacrificial offering set up in various places. The sacrificial tables are set up on the streets and are very lavishly decorated, either with antiques and playthings or with exotic flowers and rare plants. In various colors, they all compete for novelty and winning. There are a total of one hundred and thirty or forty open-air sacrifices in the entire county.</p>
<p>The Judge Who is Used to Fighting: In addition to the open-air sacrifices, the most interesting thing at the temple fair is the judge. The judge was also at its peak with more than a hundred teams. The costumes are strange and different from the Zhong Jinshi in the paintings. The strongest of their solidarity is the ancient judge. The judge is completely gathered by brick and tile burners. Because of the large number of people, they often quarrel with other judges over the upper and lower positions when dancing on the road. Watching the judges fight in the large school field is also a novel highlight of the temple fair.</p>
<p>Taoist Priests and Nuns are Often Drowsy: Every time there is a meeting, Taoist priests and nuns all go to the temple to guard the night. The incense is curling and the Buddhist chants are noisy. Such a large temple is actually crowded with people, with no space to sit. General thieves often take advantage of their unpreparedness late at night to steal things. Because they stay up for three nights in a row, they are exhausted and mentally exhausted. They often suffer unexpected losses when they are drowsy, begging the gods for mercy, but the gods make them steal. The foolishness of the Taoist priests and nuns is pitiful and ridiculous.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Travel Notes of Hong Kong and Macau (Part 1), By Yin Zibai <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Throughout my life, I have had a strong love for mountains and rivers. I have almost traveled all over the northeastern provinces, but I regret that I have not yet set foot in the southern border. A month ago, I was invited by my friend Zheng Wenbo to travel to Hong Kong and Macau for two weeks. So I bought a ticket on the Asia Queen, a ship owned by the Changxing Company with a tonnage of 16,400 tons, sailing at 20 nautical miles per hour. The distance from Hong Kong to Shanghai is 840 nautical miles, and it takes less than two days to reach Hong Kong. The journey was smooth and peaceful, and the ship was very comfortable. Upon landing, I temporarily stayed at the Dongshan Restaurant.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is located in the middle of the Asian coast, the largest commercial port in the Southeast Peninsula. The shipping routes are diverse and well-connected. The buildings are stacked on top of each other and the population is dense. Because it is a tax-free port, imported goods are re-exported from here. The British government has a Governor of Hong Kong to manage Chinese affairs.</p>

<p>After taking their seats, the president first gave the opening speech. After playing music and exchanging greetings, Dr. Luther Freeman, representing the entire faculty, gave a speech. He first spoke about the obligations and responsibilities of young people, and then said that now a young man has come from China. We can take this young man as an example. Who is this young man? It is Mr. Mei Lanfang. The first time I saw Mr. Mei's performance was "Chun Xiang Nao Xue." I found his comedic state so funny that I couldn't help but laugh. But when I met him backstage, I saw his calm and respectful air. I knew that he was a very great artist. Mr. Mei is famous all over the world, but he still treats older people with the respect of a disciple. This is the morality that our American youth lack the most, so we should take him as an example. The etiquette in China is originally like this, with fathers and brothers being called together and children and younger brothers being listed together. From this, we can know how young people should treat older people. Therefore, Chinese people always ask about age. If someone is older than oneself, then one should treat them with the respect of a disciple. It is said that if someone is ten years older, then treat them like an older brother. If someone is five years older, then follow them closely. This is also what we should take as an example. After the speech, Dr. Deng Qin left his seat and stood diagonally facing the president. The president also stood up. Dr. Deng Qin said, "Here is the great Chinese artist Mr. Mei Lanfang, whose artistic achievements are recognized worldwide and need no further elaboration. People only know that he is a great artist, but they do not know that he is also a great literary figure. In addition to acting, Mr. Mei has also devoted himself to the study of drama. He has been researching drama for more than twenty years and has created many works, contributing greatly to society. He has a library at home with many books, especially books on drama. Recently, he founded the Opera Academy in Nanjing and serves as its president. Mr. Mei has not only contributed to art but also to society and the world. I would like to introduce him to the president and ask the president to award Mr. Mei a doctorate of literature, because Mr. Mei's contributions to society are very much in line with the school's regulations for awarding degrees." After speaking, he asked Mr. Mei to stand up and introduced him to the president. The president said, "I have long heard of Mr. Mei's achievements in contributing to society, as mentioned by Dr. Deng Qin. On behalf of the faculty, I would like to award you a doctorate of literature." After speaking, he personally awarded the doctorate diploma. Then, two other doctors put the doctorate sash on Mr. Mei's shoulder. The audience applauded to congratulate him. Dr. Mei went on stage to give a speech, saying, "President, members of the board of directors, members of the faculty, students, and guests, I am very grateful to receive this honorary degree. This action shows the most profound international friendship towards us Chinese people. I am only a small representative traveling to your country to absorb new cultures and bring my own art to seek criticism from your scholars."</p>
<p>Wu, who is in charge of civilian administration, said that all government expenses are compensated by the opium monopoly and tobacco and alcohol taxes. It is said that the annual income is as high as 40 million. The weather is hot, and there is no frost or snow in winter. The wind is strong and the soil is floating, and it is often sunny and rainy. Locals say that all four seasons are like summer. A rain will turn into autumn. The customs are superstitious, and regardless of wealth or poverty, they all wear short jackets. However, there are also very novel ideas. For example, the recent promotion of the abolition of socks claims that arms can be exposed, and there is no need to wear socks on the feet. It is also economical and beautiful. I am afraid that people in Shanghai will also follow suit.</p>
<p>Zheng Junye said that the table salt in Hong Kong and Macau all comes from Annam. The annual sales are hundreds of thousands of dan, and the price is five cents per dan. Some come from Jinzhou and Taiwan, but the quality is rough and the taste is inferior. Chinese people are willing to eat domestic products. In the past, green salt was transported, but it was stopped halfway due to complicated procedures and high tax rates. After several years, not a single dan was imported. It is found that the domestic supply of table salt exceeds demand, and salt farmers in various provinces are struggling to survive due to unsalable products. The cost of green salt is less than thirty cents. If the government charges three cents per dan, as it does for salt exported to Japan, the cost will be only five cents to reach Hong Kong. Although the government only increases the salt tax by tens of thousands of gold, the salt farmers will export hundreds of thousands of dan, which is like being reborn from despair. Not only can domestic products be sold, but also people's livelihoods can be benefited. I hope that the salt administration will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Looking at Hong Kong Island at night is like a lighthouse. There are cars up and down a mountain top, and there is a cable car shaped like a train. Its route is divided into four stations: Po Tak Road, Mei Road, Po Wan Road, and Gan Ni Di Road. Men's tickets are three cents each, and women's tickets are one cent each. Trams also have floors and are divided into four stations: 1. Causeway Bay to Kennedy Town, 2. Yue Garden to Kennedy Town, 3. Yue Garden to Sheung Wan Street, 4. Sheung Wan Street to Shau Kei Wan. The fare for each trip is one cent for first class and five cents for third class. Monthly tickets are ten yuan each for third class, half price. There are also public buses running on the Royal Pier, Repulse Bay, University Hall, Des Voeux Road, Garden Road, Kennedy Road, Bonham Road, Wan Chai, Stubbs Road, Wong Nai Chung Gap, and Auhua Bay.</p>

<p>Chapter 12: A Farewell Banquet, Holding Flowers to Leave a Pretty Shadow; A Grand Garden Party, Comparing Tea to See Beautiful Postures</p>
<p>Yiyuan's silence and reticence always made Zuo Shichen think of Ruiyun's liveliness and innocence. Therefore, he really wanted to know some news about Ruiyun. It suddenly occurred to him that wasn't his great aunt asking him to call her successor, Hanyun? To know about Ruiyun, naturally, he had to call Hanyun. Hanyun was also a young teacher, and her personality was not unpleasant. She was a small bird dependent on others. When teased, her face would turn red. That kind of shy appearance was lovely. Zuo Shichen then went to call Hanyun to ask her about Ruiyun. She told Zuo Shichen everything she knew. She said that her older sister left on the twentieth day. They used a carriage to pick her up at the great aunt's house, not to pick her up for business. She said that the Zhang family hired a large official boat that was docked at the Guanyin Pavilion pier. They used a carriage to pick her up and take her to the boat, and they set sail that day. She said that A Jin accompanied her older sister. She said that she would be back in a week, and after returning, she would rest for a while and not sing in the hall. The great aunt said that A Jin had made enough money and would not sing in the hall anymore. She said that when her older sister left, she wore a newly made pink jacket and pink skirt, styled her hair, and wore flowers. She looked completely like a new bride. Our sisters also called a carriage to send her to the boat. She said that these few days, the great aunt was afraid that people would come to pester her, so she hid her older sister at the great aunt's mansion until the day before she left. Zuo Shichen knew about the great aunt that Hanyun mentioned. This was the little aunt's first founding minister, whose name was Yuan Manyun. Later, she redeemed herself, restored her freedom, and married someone, but she did not sever relations. She was like a kinsman. The reason why Ruiyun hid there was to avoid A Gui, Zhao Dakuaotou, and other people who wanted to bewitch her. Finally, Hanyun said, "If you see Second Young Master Zuo, ask him if he has picked up the photos from Baoji. It's best to ask you to print a few more. She also wants to give them to her little sisters." Zuo Shichen said, "The photos have already been picked up. As usual, there are only three. If you want to print more, I'll ask them to print more tomorrow. I don't know how many more you want to print." Hanyun said, "My older sister said she wanted to print half a dozen more." Zuo Shichen said, "Okay, I'll go print them tomorrow. Who should I give them to? Should I give them to you?" Hanyun said, "No, A Jin is coming soon. She has already told A Jin. She remembers clearly who each one is for among her sisters." Hanyun also pulled on Zuo Shichen's sleeve and said, "Second Young Master, you don't need all three. Give me one." Zuo Shichen said, "You can ask A Jin for one." Hanyun said, "She has six, and she has already given one to six people. Someone has already taken over a monk's share." Zuo Shichen said, "Okay, I'll give you one tomorrow."</p>

<p>Gold Price Resumes High Peak: Fluctuations Exceeding Twenty Taels. Yesterday, at the end of June, the gold market experienced another extraordinary upheaval. Suddenly, the price fluctuated by four or five taels, or even ten taels. The market was extremely chaotic and divergent, and the intense volatility could not be contained. The final price swings reached beyond twenty taels, causing panic among industry players. The market price, after declining, rebounded to a high peak. The trend of foreign exchange was firm and strong, and banks had a good appetite for it, but the quoted price had already increased by one and a half grades. There were obvious and hidden differences, and trading was active in the market. Different firms had different policies. Yongchengchang, Yuancheng, Yongwanxing, Shunli, Jinan, and others generally sold short positions, while Chengfengyong, Fuchang, Yongfeng, and Yu Da sought to buy. Since the early market saw a large increase, sellers were still reluctant to open at a lower price. Later, the price fluctuated up and down by several taels. Subsequently, the price fell sharply, dropping by more than ten taels, eventually reaching a peak of 571 taels. Then, buyers aggressively entered the market, and the foreign exchange rate turned from weak to strong. Banks had a strong desire to buy, and the price suddenly soared, jumping up by more than ten taels. Later, the market felt even more agitated, and the demand from various firms exceeded the supply. Exchange rates were particularly tight, suddenly exceeding the 90-tael mark. Generally, short sellers were stimulated and had to cover their positions because banks would be closed for two days starting today. Finally, the price settled between 91 taels. The market opened lower in the early morning because it was Monday, and there were no telegrams. However, according to the telegram from the previous day, the near-term price had already increased by one-sixteenth, the forward price by one-eighth, and the silver price by one-quarter. The exchange rate remained the same. The opening price in August fell slightly by 3.5 qian, to 581 taels. Then, it increased from 80 taels to 87.45 taels, but the buying and selling were different, with fluctuations of three or four taels up and down. However, the market sentiment was weak, and Yongchengchang and others sold, causing a huge drop of more than ten taels. The near-term price of Japanese gold was bought by the Japanese bank at 1.3005 taels. The price of September British gold was 6 pence 6875. With the announcement that British gold had increased by 375, US dollars by 875, and Japanese gold decreased slightly by 2.75, the price was only 73 taels, suddenly rising beyond 76 taels. However, the sentiment was not good, and there were still many sellers. The internal exchange rate also loosened, and the price fell to 71.9 taels. At 9:45, the price started to rise because Dalian companies and others bought, so at 10:00, it was 80.5 taels. After five or six minutes, it suddenly dropped by six taels to 74.5 taels, and then immediately soared to 82 taels. This was because the exchange market suddenly changed. Mitsui bought spot Dalian gold at 1.31 qian. An Da bought September British gold at 6 pence 875. At 10:02, the price retreated to 77.5 qian. After that, the trend was upward. September British gold was bought by Zhengjin and Mitsui, from 6 pence 8125 to 625. Maihang and others also absorbed some. The situation was volatile, and the price had already broken through 80 taels. Chengfengyong and others bought a large amount. By noon, the price had jumped up by eight taels. The momentum was good. At noon, the price reached 86 taels. The noon closing price was 84.5 qian. The quoted price was changed to 646.2 qian. The quoted price of Japanese gold was slightly reduced by 2.75, resulting in a deduction of more than 70 taels, to 60 taels. In the end, the price rebounded by 6.7 taels. The afternoon market opened at 86.3 qian, which was the remaining momentum from the noon closing. Then, it was 88.3 qian. Sellers saw a lot of profit-taking and came to sell, causing the price to drop to 83.5 qian. Afterward, the foreign exchange rate suddenly showed a strong trend. Banks mutually traded near-term British gold at 6 pence 375. Datong absorbed forward gold at 5625. After 3:00, September gold was only 6 pence 375, so the sentiment was greatly boosted. The market situation suddenly jumped thousands of feet, soaring by more than eight taels. It had already exceeded 90 taels. Various firms bought extensively, reaching 92 taels at 3:30. In an instant, it returned to 87-88 taels. The price rose again at 4:00, so there was a double closing price. Shortly after, the price increased by three or four taels. The closing price at 4:30 was 91.2 qian. The near-term British gold only closed at 6 pence 25, and the Japanese gold was 1.34 qian. The gold price increased by 6.7 taels compared to the previous weekend. This was actually a rebound after three consecutive days of decline. The highest price during the day was 92 taels, and the lowest price was 71 taels, with a difference of more than 21 taels, which was quite significant. The early morning opening price for goods was 82 taels, the noon closing price was 84.5 taels, and the afternoon closing price was 91 taels. The quoted price was 60 taels to 54-55 taels. The registered price in the morning was 83 taels to 85 taels, and in the afternoon, it was 88 taels to 90 taels. The water replenishment was 83 taels in the morning and 88 taels in the afternoon, with a difference of five taels.</p>
<p>The market transactions varied, and the transactions of each firm were as follows: Zhifengyong, Yuanmaoyong, Dadecheng, Fuchang, Yuanyu Yong, Yuantai, Futaiheng, and others had inconsistent supply and demand. Chengfengyong, Yongfeng, Yu Da, Xiangyu, Bingxing, and Taixing all bought. Wanxing, Yongchengchang, Yuancheng Yong, Yuancheng, Jinan, Yuanheng, and others mostly sold. In the afternoon, Yuanmaoyong, Chunyuan Yong, and various short sellers all bought. Yuancheng Yong, Fuyu, Yu Da, Shunli, and retail investors all sold. There were also firms that sometimes bought and sometimes sold, similar to scalping. Dalian companies bought more than 1,300 contracts in the morning and sold 2,000 contracts. In the afternoon market, they only bought more than 200 contracts and sold more than 300 contracts. Guang companies had a small number of transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the end of the first half of the year, and the banking sector was very busy with the settlement of accounts for the first half of the year. All kinds of silver receipts, remittance transactions, and silver and foreign public bills of exchange were too large in amount and involved too many procedures to be investigated for a while. Only various market prices in the market were available. Ocean cents were very weak in the early market, at 7 qian 2 fen 3 li 1 hao 2 hu ban. The market surged by more than 1 li at noon, to 7 qian 2 fen 4 li 2 hao ban. The recent ups and downs were unexpected. Silver dismantling was also expensive. The early market was 1 qian 6 fen, and the noon market was 1 qian 2 fen. The bank's listed price was 6 fen, with water added at the top. The noon market traded at 8-9 fen. Ocean remittance transactions were 1,612,000 in the early market and 1,175,000 at noon. There was no market for banknotes in the early market, but 56,000 at noon.

<p>Tariff and Demobilization Bonds Fall Sharply. Yesterday was the last day of the first half of the year, and the trading of public debt futures in the market was very active. The total trading volume in the forward and post markets reached more than 12.4 million, but the spot market only had transactions of 7,000 yuan in National Land bonds and Demobilization bonds. Market sentiment was weak, and selling pressure continued to dominate. The prices of various bonds continued to fall, following the trend of the previous day. Tariff, Demobilization, and Disarmament bonds all had large amounts of supply, and the decline was the most severe. Compared to the previous weekend, the spot price of Demobilization bonds fell by 3 yuan, and the futures prices of Demobilization bonds and Tariff bonds also fell by about 2 yuan. Although Disarmament bonds slightly increased at the close, they still fell by 1 yuan. Although the decline in bond prices was due to the poor situation, the weak momentum of new buyers at the end of the accounting period was also a factor.</p>

<h3 id="e202">A Glimpse of the Cotton Yarn Delivery Last Month <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>Delivery Price: 154 Taels... Volume: 4,900. The market situation for cotton yarn in June was initially due to the raging gold market and the sharp contraction of foreign exchange. Generally, those who were overly sensitive anticipated that the price of foreign goods would rise and that domestic yarn would be cheaper. Therefore, they adopted a precautionary approach and bought heavily, going long. Furthermore, Lichang, Tianchang, Yicheng, Tianlong, and several other firms believed that the gold price would soar to over 600 taels, and their desire to go long became stronger. Therefore, they bought heavily in the space of a few days, turning from short to long, for approximately 30,000 to 40,000 bales. The market was quickly searched by several firms and felt dry, and the situation became tense. At the beginning of the month, Zhang Guijun had just withdrawn, and the Guang gang searched for 10,000 to 20,000 bales of spot yarn, and most of them were 10-count coarse yarn. Market sentiment was even stronger, and retail investors, seeing the unfavorable situation, had to cover their short positions. Therefore, the highest price reached 159 taels 9 qian. Shortly after, actual sales were sluggish. Although the Guang gang bought a large batch, return transactions were still lacking. Although the military had withdrawn, internal vitality was damaged, and the money market had not yet recovered. The market situation was also weak. At the end of the month, cracks appeared in the Dongyang three-brand yarn. Due to the political turmoil in India, the sales channels for three-brand yarn were cut off, and the inventory increased daily. It was difficult for the bulls to support the price, and the market price suddenly collapsed. Although manufacturers in this port tightened up the market for yarn, the general trend was difficult to reverse. Those who had turned long in the past turned short again, and the lowest price returned to 153. The next-to-last day saw a slight lack of several hundred bales on the seller's side, and the price rebounded by two taels. The resulting delivery price was 154 taels, with a total of 4,900 bales delivered. The delivered yarn included 2,515 bales of 10-count Double Happiness, 600 bales of He Feng, 200 bales of Bao, 420 bales of Three Sheep, 216 bales of Shepherd, and 50 bales of Earth, for a total of 4,000 bales. The remaining 900 bales were self-delivered. Hengda received 4,000 bales, which was the largest. No. 18 Gongtai and No. 15 Yu Da each delivered 2,800 bales, which was the most. The names and volumes of the receiving and delivering brokers are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e203">Summary of Han Biao Delivery in June <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>A Narrative of Short-Term Changes. The market for Han Biao in June coincided with the raging gold market and the sharp contraction of foreign exchange. The market was filled with speculation that the price of 40 taels was possible, as the combined price of foreign cotton could not be higher than domestic cotton. Therefore, the highest price reached 37 taels 4 qian. Later, the Han gang took the opportunity to sell heavily, suppressing market sentiment. After a slight period of consolidation, Indian and American cotton prices fell, and the gold market softened. The price of Indian cotton fell by 32 rupees in a single day, an unprecedented decline. People became greatly alarmed. At the same time, Indian cotton was sold cheaply, and Shenxin bought several thousand pieces. Buyers panicked. The downward trend intensified at the end of the month, as Ruida speculators sold heavily, putting even more pressure on the market. The lowest price was 35 taels 2 qian, a difference of 2 taels 2 qian. The resulting delivery price was 36 taels, with a total of 14,900 dan. The goods consisted mostly of Huoji cotton, with Hengda receiving 6,000 dan, Hengde receiving 2,300 dan, and Xinhua receiving 1,200 dan. The largest sellers were Shenchang, with 5,000 dan, Xinheng, with 1,400 dan, and Tianlong, with 1,000 dan. The names of the receiving and delivering brokers are listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e204">Current Yarn and Cotton Transactions Amidst Handover Frenzy <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>The general trend remains stagnant. Japanese yarn edges up slightly at month's end, while the cotton yarn market remains lackluster. Spot yarn sales remain sluggish, and all sectors lack vitality. The primary reason is weak purchasing power. Overseas cotton yarn prices are mediocre, showing no signs of recovery, leading to wavering confidence. Futures yarn is undergoing handover procedures at the end of the month, making the market atmosphere increasingly dull and uninspired. The prospects for the yarn market remain uncertain. Spot yarn transactions are still sparse. Japanese yarn prices have risen slightly due to the end of the month. A survey of purchases by various sectors reveals a total of only 440 bales bought, with local merchants taking 50 bales. Out-of-town buyers, including the Niuzhuang sector, purchased 125 bales, inland 45 bales, Yantai Shih-pao, Shantou 90 bales, Haizhou 70 bales, Guangdong sector 80 bales, Fujian 5 bales, and Ningbo 5 bales. Market sentiment suggests that Japanese yarn has edged up slightly. The raw cotton market is in a state of equilibrium. Imported cotton is relatively stable, while domestic cotton is slightly quieter. However, actual demand is weak. Indian cotton prices are softening, and exchange rates are increasingly stable. The overall trend remains bearish. One hundred and fifty bales of Yao cotton and over two hundred bales of Tong cotton arrived at the docks, with sales figures lagging behind. One hundred pieces of Shaanxi cotton 37.35 were purchased by the Hongzhang Factory, with spot goods delivered to the factory.</p>

<p>After opening on Wednesday last week, the market situation in Mumbai remained severe due to a lack of buyers and profit-taking by long positions. White Broach cotton for July-August delivery fell from 208 rupees to 196 rupees. However, large purchases by exporters brought the price back to 201 rupees, with the weekend reaching 215 rupees, showing a positive trend. European mainland merchants are showing considerable interest in Bengal cotton due to its particularly excellent quality this season. The following is a summary of the statistics for the past week (in thousands of bales):</p>
<p>Previous Week    Last Week</p>
<p>Cumulative receipts since September 1st: 3158 3343</p>
<p>Weekend inventory: 1153 1215</p>
<p>Cumulative exports since September 1st: 236 12171</p>
<p>Exports to Europe: 774 751</p>
<p>Exports to China: 316 351</p>
<p>Exports to Japan: 1218 1012</p>
<p>Exports to other regions: 535 7</p>
<p>The demand for spot goods in Liverpool last week was quite good. In the futures market, prices were relatively soft due to favorable news about the cotton harvest in the US cotton belt. However, mainland merchants took advantage of this low point to make large purchases. Between Wednesday and Thursday, Indian merchants engaged in heavy short selling, and long positions were also closed out. Subsequently, mainland and Indian merchants resumed purchasing. Egyptian cotton prices were firm.</p>

<p>The supply of japonica rice is about to be exhausted. Yesterday, japonica rice in Zhabei was still publicly assessed by the appraisal bureau, with the highest price at 21 yuan. Registered rice boats have already sold two-thirds of their volume within two days, totaling around 3,000 shi. The majority of transactions were at 21 yuan. Very little cargo entered the customs. Thin rice was also appraised by the bureau and then distributed to rice shops for sale. There are very few boats remaining in the lower reaches of the river, and the supply may be exhausted today. As no new boats have arrived from various sectors, the source of supply after the exhaustion of the current stock is a major concern. Although parboiled rice has arrived, supplies are scarce. Due to the restraining effect of the shortage of japonica rice, coupled with dull demand, buyers are not very enthusiastic, and prices continue to weaken. Special-grade parboiled rice is priced between 19 yuan 3 and 4 jiao. The market price is only 19 yuan, and the market situation is particularly sluggish. Goods arriving in South Shanghai are still lacking. The market trade is still dominated by foreign rice, but it is reported that several boats may arrive from the south within days. According to news from rice merchants in the interior, the new rice harvests in Jiangxi, Anhui, and Hubei are generally good this year, except for war zones. This new indica rice may be available for shipment downstream in late this month or at the latest in early August. This type of rice is commonly known as early new indica rice. In bumper years, the volume is very large, no less than the japonica rice from Changzhou and Wuxi. Its sales areas are Wuhu, Nanjing, and Wuxi. The goods shipped to Shanghai have already been milled white, so the top-quality rice in this city is this type of rice.</p>
<h3 id="e208">June Flour Delivery Situation <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Only 16,000 bags of Red &amp; Blue Car flour were delivered. Yesterday was the delivery day for June flour futures. Only 16,000 bags of Fufeng's Red &amp; Blue Car flour were officially delivered to the exchange. The remaining factories had settled their positions in advance, so there were no deliveries. On the receiving side, it is reported that local brokers took 10,000 bags and the northern sector took 6,000 bags. Observing the June market conditions, it is feared that the trend will weaken due to sluggish sales. With the opening of new stalls, sales have been smoother than usual. The Tianjin sector has been watching and has not yet reached the purchasing stage. According to industry insiders, the Tianjin sector may be interested when the standard reaches around 2 liang and 4 qian and a half. The total trading volume of futures for the entire month has increased almost doubled compared to last month. A list is as follows:</p>
<p>June: 22,308    August: 32,330</p>
<p>October: 13,027    July: 34,029</p>
<p>September: 22,161    November: 712</p>

<p>Due to continuous arrivals. Yesterday, foreign rice weakened because three new boats arrived the day before yesterday, and one or two boats are still arriving daily. This has led to a cautious outlook. Small importers have stopped purchasing after fulfilling their orders and are mostly waiting to see what happens. However, some inland sectors and Yangtze River customers are still actively purchasing in the market due to strong demand, so the market has not experienced a sharp decline. However, it is still a few points softer than the previous day. The volume of small short-grain rice traded was 5,000 bags at 17 yuan and 1 jiao, large short-grain rice 4,000 bags at 16 yuan 5 and 6 jiao, small short-grain brown rice 2,000 bags at 15 yuan 5 jiao and a half. Also, 3,000 bags of road cargo rice at 15 yuan 3 jiao, No. 2 Saigon 500-color rice at 16 yuan 9 jiao. The price of the same grade of Min Dang Ke Gai Pi Long Rong brown rice is similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e210">New Summer Cocoons from Silk and Tea Producing Jiangning Enter the Market <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Production volume is limited... High-quality cocoon prices are expected to reach 60 yuan. Although farmers in the four villages of Jiangning raised summer silkworms this year, the cold weather, continuous moldy rain, and subsequent heat caused silkworms to get sick and die during the major molt, resulting in a loss of 70-80%. New summer cocoons have entered the market near the city, and it is estimated that cocoon production will be at most about 30%. The Minfeng Cocoon Company outside Yaohuamen opened yesterday. The initial price of cocoons was 50 yuan. Due to the limited arrival of cocoons, the price rose to 55 yuan. High-quality cocoons are expected to reach 60 yuan.</p>

<p>The overall trend in the tea market yesterday was still not considered positive. Zhen Mei green tea from both the roadside and local Zhuang sectors remained sluggish, except for some sales of Wuyuan North Township goods. Sales of Needle-brow and Xiu-brow teas have been slightly more active recently, but selling prices remain low. The market for Qimen black tea is becoming increasingly depressed. It is heard that the head of the Russian Aid Society arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but it is still difficult to predict when operations will begin.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Piece Goods: White Crepe Fabric Prices Soar <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The local cotton fabric market is trending downward. Customer sales are gradually slowing down. The primary reason is the unstable situation, with most people adopting a wait-and-see approach. Moreover, as it is the hot season, this is typically a slow period. Yesterday, only fine cloth was able to hold its ground because dyed cloth had smooth sales channels. The rest were trending downward, especially coarse cloth, which fell another 2.5 fen yesterday. There is still strong demand from the northern sector for Hubei goods' Wannianqing and Lu-character brands. Over one hundred pieces were traded yesterday. Wannianqing opened at 8 liang 8 qian and a half, and Lu-character opened at 7 liang 7 qian and a half. Coarse twill is increasingly sluggish, and both local and out-of-town customers are rarely replenishing their stocks. Fine twill remains largely unchanged. East-West piece goods have been trending erratically recently. The Yuehua brand of eastern goods fell slightly yesterday. Fine broadcloth Hukinting fell slightly. Baoqiu still requires 2 qian 9 fen and 2 li of tax. White crepe fabric suddenly saw a major surge in demand yesterday, with prices soaring by about 2 qian. Jiao Ye title slips opened at 3 liang 7 qian, and Yin Pan opened at 3 liang 9 qian and a half, an increase of 7-8 qian compared to when it first hit the market, and an increase of 1 liang compared to last year. This is unprecedented. The supply of Yuan foreign yarn has been cut off. Dian Qiu Xiang is already priced at 9 liang 5 qian. Shuang Niao, Zijinshan, Xiao Meiren, and Li Taibai are all out of stock. Printed straight tribute woolens have arrived in Shanghai in various colors, opening at 3 qian 1 fen for mixed colors and 3 qian 1 fen and a half for solid colors. There were some transactions in the Han sector. Fine twill western goods are quite active in this market. Fair Squirrel sold out at 7 liang 6 qian and a half. Hao Hua Sanlu Tou opened at 10 liang. There were some transactions in Zhenjiang.</p>

<p>Flower Garden Lead Wire is generally a niche item in the hardware market, so the industry has not paid much attention to it. However, as an important item in military supplies, the asking price also has a certain standard. Recently, it has increased by another 6-7 qian, reaching 11 liang per lot. Those who need it are still queuing up to purchase it. The market at the end of the street has been purchased to the point of exhaustion, and the market situation is very impressive. Currently, the market price is being shouted up to 11 liang 5 qian per bundle. It is heard that a large overseas order broke out yesterday, with over five thousand bundles ordered. The deal was placed by a hardware store on Broadway Road, with a transaction price of 9 liang 8 qian and a half.</p>

<p>Although only five years old, Patricia Anne Sampson of Cedar Falls, Iowa, USA, has attracted the attention of the entire city because she is already able to compose piano music. Patricia is the daughter of a piano professor at the Provincial Normal College. Like the famous Mozart, she was able to play the piano when most children were too young to show any musical talent. She has never received any formal instruction from her father, G.W. Sampson, Jr. She has already composed half a dozen pieces without any intention of guiding her, but her abilities have fully developed. A waltz called "Peter Pan" is her favorite, and everyone who has heard the piece also loves it. Randolph Ganz, the president of the Chicago Conservatory of Music, after hearing her work, advised, "It is best to let her develop her talent freely." When she was only two years old, she would climb onto the piano keys whenever she had the chance. After that, she began to amaze her parents because she was able to play the pieces that she usually heard her father teach his students. Among these pieces are Bohm's "The Fountain," Heller's "Curious Story," Von's "The Infant Jesus," and Paderewski's "Melody in B." A visitor who came to their home sang her a song called "Bye Baby Byelo," and she immediately sang along. She could sing and play everything that her parents sang and played for her when she was asleep. Abo Freeman, another piano professor at the Normal College, said, "What people have to learn has already been born with her. She will become a special composer and pianist." In addition to the piano, she still likes to play with dolls and dogs (Kewpies) like other children.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Dedicated to Young People Who Love Literature and Art <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Ji Ping</p>
<p>From a psychological perspective, we can see that youth is the most intense period of life. Not only are there significant physical developments, but also a leap in psychological characteristics. Emotions at this stage are no longer as easily extinguished or limited to the present scope and trivial matters. With the expansion of the world and the development of knowledge, emotions are more persistent and demand concrete expression. This demand is reflected in the emergence of love and attention to social causes. At the same time, a love of literature and art is a common and powerful tendency during this period. Because literature and art are originally the organization of emotions, it is only natural that this path is most suitable for young people with rich emotions. Looking at the literary history of various countries, almost every writer started working hard in their youth, and some even became famous in their youth. What does this fact illustrate? It is that the combination of youth and literature and art is by no means accidental but has a strong psychological foundation.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Picture of a Painter Pon Hsün Ch’ing (Shot by Hsü Wei Nan) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, it also has social significance. We know that literature and art are part of culture, and culture is a product of the nation. Youth is a group with creative abilities, the vanguard of the era, and the main force of the nation. Therefore, in the sense of popularizing and improving culture, in other words, in promoting the glory of the nation, youth is inevitably endowed with this mission, and the pursuit of literary and artistic work is the practice of this mission. In short, youth and literature and art should become a purposeful combination, that is, on the one hand, based on the inherent artistic requirements, and at the same time, not standing on a personal standpoint but taking national culture as a prerequisite for conscious action.</p>
<p>Chinese youth, in the past years, groaned under autocracy like other people, and almost lost the characteristics that youth should have. Literature and art were forgotten. The so-called scholars only revolved around the fantasy of promotion. This was determined by objective historical conditions, and we don't need to blame them. However, after the Xinhai Revolution, the tumultuous May Fourth Movement followed. This movement evolved from politics to culture, and the cultural movement was mainly focused on literary revolution. Originally, this movement was created by young students. By this time, young people in general were deeply connected with literature and art. We can see from the works of that time and everything else that young people had a crazy enthusiasm for literature and art. This enthusiasm laid the foundation for the new literature in general. After that, with the evolution of society, the May Fourth Movement was divided into water and less youth. The efforts of young people in literature and art have also become several forces, each boasting of its own literary and artistic group. When the National Revolutionary Army marched north and the military power reached the Yangtze River, many young people immersed in the field of literature and art ran into the army, and literature and art entered a period of silence. This period did not last long, and then political changes caused a sharp division in literature and art. The literary debate in the spring of the seventeenth year was a concrete manifestation, and since then, the youth's view of literature and art has been distressed in theory. To this day, many young people have gone into confusion. This presents a bad symptom in national culture. In the past, young people made considerable efforts in literature and art. This is undeniable, but their mistakes are indeed numerous. First, from the perspective of literature and art itself, the general youth's demand for literature and art is aesthetic enjoyment. Therefore, the atmosphere of emotion and personality is very strong, and they forget the elements of the era and socialization. They believe that literature and art are a spark of genius, so they only grasp fragmentary impressions and seek so-called "inspiration." They are never willing to have deep cultivation. Even though the "Palace of Art" has been evacuated recently, what has been exchanged is a rigid theory of social science, which has become a passive megaphone. The erroneous views on literature and art are still the same as before. Second, from the attitude of engaging in literature and art, many young people engage in literary and artistic work, not because they have nothing to do, but because they want to spend their time or are willing to be special tools. At the same time, there are many young people who regard engaging in literature and art as a "knocking brick." When they have not found the door to enter, they work very hard in literature and art. However, once an idol is created and there is another important position, they abandon literature and art like discarded shoes or even change their minds before they become famous and abandon it to go elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Looking Up (Photographed by Chang I An) <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>In conclusion, it is always impossible to regard literature and art as a lifelong career. These are obvious phenomena in the past, but they are bad and wrong phenomena, which are harmful to national culture.</p>
<p>We examine the above errors and can get a common place, that is, we have not regarded literature and art as something about national culture. Only in this way, in the first place, do we only regard literature and art as two extremes, either personal or class. Therefore, we are not willing to consciously cultivate ourselves. In the second place, we are also irrelevant and only think in a narrow place, and do not recognize it as a sacred spiritual undertaking. If these two mistakes are not corrected, it will not only be a chronic illness of the literary world, but also a crucial part of national culture. But how to correct it? This question can already be seen from the above, that is, we should first determine the central consciousness of literature and art, and this central consciousness is undoubtedly the national consciousness, in other words, taking national culture as the standpoint. We know that in the distant beginning of history, art did not originate from personal consciousness but from the consciousness of life formed from the standpoint of the nation. The important mission of literature and art is to develop the national spirit and consciousness to which it belongs. At the same time, only the development of literature and art, which is the highest expression of national culture, can make the life of the nation upward, the spirit improved, and the society progressive. The Chinese nation is now suffering from all kinds of oppression, and the domestic literary world is taking the path of that abnormal development, with crises lurking everywhere. Therefore, the establishment of national consciousness in literature and art today is absolutely necessary. Young people who love literature and art, free yourselves from the distress of your literary theories, recognize your current task. This current task is the affirmation of national consciousness to actively develop the national strength and create a new life for the nation.</p>
<h3 id="e219">What is the Purpose of Young People Studying? <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Bringing up this question for discussion, some people may laugh at me for being bored. However, this question is closely related to the youth themselves and the future of the nation. It is more meaningful for us to discuss it than to discuss any other question.</p>
<p>Some people say that young people study for their own sake. Young people must have a foothold in society, find their own way out, and solve all their own problems. All of this requires studying. Therefore, friends who are doing sweet love dreams must also study to solve their love problems. Friends who are dissatisfied with the status quo must also study in order to seek their future golden age. Friends who have no status in society and rely on others' breath must also enroll in order to obtain special status and satisfy their desire for control. Needless to say, friends who are at the end of their rope must also enroll. There are many future paths to promotion and wealth. Honestly speaking, which young person's study is not for his own selfishness? However, this kind of extremely individualistic study, the result of selfishness and self-interest, is greatly detrimental to the development of the nation's future. At the same time, the young people themselves have less benefits and more losses.</p>
<p>Some people say that young people study for the sake of society. There are too many problems in society waiting for young people to solve. Young people study in order to use knowledge as a tool to solve social problems. Who can say that he is not? Therefore, young people who believe in socialism must enroll. They can wear suits, eat big meals, sit in automobiles, and stroll around dance halls while talking about their class struggle, go to coffee shops, open big hotels, sit under electric fans, and do proletarian literature. The result of this kind of extremely socialist study is to announce the death penalty for society and dig graves for oneself.</p>
<p>Finally, we should advocate that young people study for the sake of the nation. We are an oppressed nation. To obtain a free and equal position from an oppressed position, this important mission has fallen on our shoulders. We are studying in order to save the Chinese nation from danger. We are studying in order to seek the development of the Chinese nation. Young people who study natural science should strive for the development of material civilization to solve the four major problems of the nation's clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Young people who study social science should strive for practical knowledge of politics and law in order to improve the health of the nation's group organization and the improvement of common life. Young people who study literature and art should strive for the nationalistic literary movement to actively awaken national consciousness and promote national spirit. To sum up, we study neither for our own selfishness nor for a certain class in society nor for a narrow national concept. We study in order to seek the interests of the entire nation and find a way out in order to achieve the goal of freedom and equality. Dear</p>

<p>Mr. F, who teaches us history, is a graduate of a church university. He is probably forty years old. He is very short and his shoulders are a little bent. His eyes are very deep and his cheeks are suddenly sunken. This makes his body seem very thin and pitiful. He lacks the ability to intimidate students. Secondly, he mechanically reads a sentence of the original text and translates a sentence of Chinese, as if he were teaching an English textbook in junior high school, without adding any material outside the book, so he cannot arouse the interest of the students. Thirdly, history is fundamentally about settling old accounts, especially Western history is very complicated, and most students get a headache when they listen to it. So, except for a few people who are particularly interested in history, the rest of the students do not listen to the class. As soon as the bell rings for class, Mr. F immediately runs into the classroom. At this time, the classroom is so quiet that there is not even a single person. He puts the book on the desk, opens the roll book, pulls out the pen tube of the fountain pen, puts it on the roll book, and waits quietly. After two minutes, the student masters slowly come with their books.</p>
<p>Strangely, although there are very few people who listen to his class attentively, everyone is present when he calls the roll. Very few people are absent. This has to be thanked to a motto, "Go to class for roll call."</p>
<p>After the roll call, the teacher turns the book over and teaches sentence by sentence. At this time, some people are looking down intently at novels, some are flipping through newspapers at will, and some are talking in low voices. Only a few people are raising their heads and opening their mouths, listening attentively. "The price of gold is rising sharply, almost breaking through the 600 tael mark." One student, whose father is from the Gold Exchange, said to another student.</p>
<p>"That's right. As soon as the price of gold rises, everything becomes expensive. The books of the Commercial Press will also be sold at the real price, and we will have an extra expense in vain." Another student seems to be full of emotion.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, can I borrow your newspaper?"</p>
<p>He took the newspaper and flipped through it at will, and then looked for it in detail in the local news, saying in a surprised and distrustful tone, "Hey, there are no rape cases today."</p>
<p>At the same time, several other students are discussing movie stars.</p>
<p>"Clara Bow is really good. Her performance of innocent and lively energy is the most natural."</p>
<p>"What's so good about Clara Bow? I don't like her kind of frivolous energy the most. Jenny Gaynor's performance is really delicate and profound."</p>
<p>"I think Bibi Daniel is good."</p>
<p>It's really inexplicable. It has nothing to do with them, but they all like to support their favorite stars and oppose the stars that others are satisfied with. Several parties do not give in to each other, and then start a fierce debate. The voice gets louder and louder, almost forgetting that they are in the classroom.</p>
<p>Mr. F is a good man. As long as they talk quietly or write, he will not interfere. Now that it is too outrageous, he has to manage it, saying angrily, "If you don't want to listen, you can go out. Don't make noise in the classroom and disturb others."</p>
<p>In order to save Mr. F's face, everyone was silent for a while. In less than five minutes, everything was the same as before.</p>
<p>"Lao Wang, what are you eating?"</p>
<p>"Because I didn't eat, I bought a few pieces of cake."</p>
<p>"Give me a piece."</p>
<p>"Sorry, I just finished eating it."</p>
<p>"Don't be so stingy. It doesn't matter if you take a piece to eat."</p>
<p>"I really finished eating it. If you want to eat it, I will buy it for you after class."</p>
<p>"·············"</p>
<p>"·············"</p>
<p>Suddenly all the sounds stopped automatically. Everyone looked up at Mr. F because at this time he was reading a sentence: "Mary Stuart is a woman of remarkable beauty." Then he translated, "Mary Stuart is an unusually beautiful woman." A woman, and an unusually beautiful woman, what an attractive noun, so everyone's voices stopped.</p>
<p>A student who is known for being naughty stood up and said, "Mr. F, what is Mary Stuart's Faoe like?"</p>
<p>Mr. F is about to get angry, but he immediately feels that it is not worth it, frowning and saying, "Isn't there a picture of her here?"</p>
<p>This naughty student is very ignorant and still wants to ask, "Mr. F, have you seen it before?"</p>
<p>Mary Stuart was a woman of the sixteenth century, and Mr. F is a modern person. Never mind the difference in countries, how can anyone live so long to see a character from two centuries ago? This is obviously a thoughtless, deliberately joking, stupid question. Mr. F got angry.</p>
<p>"You don't ask about other important questions, but you only ask about these boring questions. Do you really have the sincerity to listen to history?"</p>
<p>··········</p>
<p>The first time the bell rang to end the class, Mr. F's words were only half said, and the students had already rushed out.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Female Poet to Enter Fudan <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Miss Yu Xiuyun, the female poet and author of the poetry collection "Lake Breeze," has been receiving attention since we saw her name on the list of high school graduates from the Education Bureau. Because she has always been admired, we were eager to learn about her news after "Patriotism." Graduates of Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, Zhang Huazhen and Wu Zhihong (photo by Chang Lie). The sole reason for her attention is that she is a high-achieving female poet, as well as a female athlete, possessing both poetic beauty and physical health. Recently, she created a sensation by playing a female lawyer on stage several times, inadvertently earning the informal title of "Queen," a term still carrying some feudal connotations. Given her background, pursuing higher education was never a problem. However, the question was which university she would attend. As you can see from the title, she will be entering Fudan University. Shouldn't we celebrate the arrival of another beautiful "princess" in the Eastern Palace? No, what we should celebrate is the prospect of a few short poems in publications, a healthy and unrestrained figure on the basketball court, and a moving female lead on stage. This will happen soon, as she plans to enter Fudan's summer school during the summer vacation. However, she said something along the lines of "closing the door to study and ceasing activities," which is disappointing. There may be a reason for her words. People have given her the beautiful title of "Queen," enjoying watching her and even subjecting her to some slander while wearing the crown. However, according to social psychologists, this is a normal state of society and is not surprising. Thinking about this may make one less concerned. We hope so. (Zhu Yan)</p>

<h3 id="e223">Foreign Life Amidst Rising Material Prices <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>Huo Lin Where did the six hundred taels of silver go? The price of gold is rising, the value of silver is falling, and the prices of various goods are soaring along with gold. When talking about the word "life," everyone secretly complains. Recently, a Western newspaper published an article titled "Rising Cost of Living," revealing the impact of rising prices on foreigners in Shanghai. It's easy to imagine a sense of embarrassment. It says that even if a small family of two has a monthly salary of six hundred taels of silver, their life is still difficult to maintain. Here is a detailed account of how a monthly salary of six hundred silver dollars is spent on food, clothing, and housing: The first thing is to find a place to live. A very small house or a lodge room, with no furnishings, will cost at least sixty-five or seventy-five taels in rent. Finding a place where the rent is as low as fifty taels is considered very lucky. However, how many people can find a house in the first month of the year with a rent of only forty taels of silver, including water? However, in the current situation, it is only a recollection. If we flip through the newspapers from the beginning of the year, we see a rental advertisement for a house located on Route Sayzoong, recently wallpapered, with a monthly rent of only thirty-five taels. Once you have a place to live, you need to hire servants. A cook now costs thirty to forty yuan in wages. Last year, they could be hired for twenty-five yuan. Fortunately, the price of a "boy" is as high as twenty yuan, whereas it used to be only fifteen yuan. An amah's wage must be twenty yuan. Your handkerchiefs and socks are still being pilfered, plus twenty-five yuan worth of food stolen from the kitchen. The expenses of the servants supporting their brothers, grandmothers, and friends cost eighty-five to ninety yuan. A very simple life for two people, rarely entertaining guests, still requires a monthly food bill of one hundred and twenty-five yuan. This figure does not include delicacies like olives and caviar. This figure only includes taking some vegetables and leftover roasted meat to make a mixed dish for today's lunch, and drinking a little cocktail whiskey soda and sherry, wine, and white wine when guests are present before two meals a day, then another seventy-five yuan is needed each month. It is questionable whether this amount is enough. One family of two spent seventy-two yuan last month, but they only entertained people for two meals. Electricity costs ten taels of silver per month, compared to eight taels last year. Gas is twenty-three taels, compared to fifteen taels last year. A telephone costs fifty-two taels per year, and it is said to be increasing. Tap water costs five taels of silver, with further increases expected. Using an electric refrigerator in the summer costs six hundred taels of silver. Fuel for heating in the winter costs thirty-eight yuan per month. Laundry costs twelve yuan per month for two people, compared to ten yuan in the past. Dry cleaning used to cost eight yuan, but now it costs ten yuan. If you have a car, you will need at least forty gallons of gasoline per month, which is only enough for two trips from home to the office each day, with very few pleasure drives. Six weeks ago, gasoline cost fifty-five cents per gallon, but now it costs eighty cents. Rumor has it that it will soon sell for one dollar and ten cents per gallon (currently, it has reached this amount). In this situation, it is best to leave the car in the garage and take the bus instead. Now let's talk about daily household expenses. Medicines and cosmetics, toothpaste that used to sell for seventy-five cents now cost over one yuan. Light gas for lighting used to cost one yuan per bottle a year ago, but now costs one dollar and twenty-five cents. Palm soap used to cost one dollar for five bars, but now there are only four. Aspirin costs one dollar per bottle, whereas it cost seventy-five cents six months ago. Horlick's Malted Milk costs three dollars and twenty-five cents per can, compared to two dollars and fifty cents in January. Hall's Hair Renewer costs five dollars, whereas it used to cost three dollars and fifty cents. Pond's Cold Cream costs two dollars and fifty cents per jar, compared to two dollars in the past. Hand lotion costs one dollar and seventy-five cents, which is essential in Shanghai, compared to one dollar and twenty-five cents in January. Colgate shaving soap costs one dollar per tube, compared to seventy-five cents in the past. Gillette razor blades now cost two dollars and fifty cents, compared to two dollars in the past. Listerine mouthwash has increased significantly from two dollars to two dollars and ninety cents. Face powder now costs five dollars and fifty cents per box, compared to four dollars in the past. Lipstick costs one dollar and seventy-five cents, compared to one dollar and thirty cents in the past. Rouge costs the same. In this year, using a small jar of perfume is a real luxury. Clothes are essential, although in this weather, it is best not to wear clothes. In foreign-run stores, women's shoes cost from thirty-one dollars and fifty cents to thirty-seven dollars and fifty cents. Men's boots cost from eighteen dollars and fifty cents to thirty-eight dollars and fifty cents. Footwear has increased by 25% in the past six months. Silk stockings cost seven dollars and fifty cents per pair but are not durable. More durable stockings cost five dollars and thirty cents. Ordinary stockings usually cost three dollars and fifty cents to five dollars. A stylish tie now costs eight yuan. In the past, this amount could buy three pairs of socks costing one dollar and seventy-five cents to three dollars and seventy-five cents, which is lucky, but is already a 25% increase from the past. A set of high-quality clothes made of Scottish wool costs an average of one hundred and thirty-five yuan. Last year, the same quality would have cost one hundred and ten yuan. High-quality hats cost twenty-eight dollars and fifty cents, compared to twenty-one to twenty-two yuan last year. Palm Beach suits cost forty-two yuan, compared to thirty-seven yuan in the past. White flannel costs sixty-five yuan, compared to fifty-five yuan in the past. A person should have at least six sets of clothes in the summer, and preferably twelve. Shirts have increased by two yuan since last year, and better quality shirts cost fourteen dollars and fifty cents. BVDs cost four dollars and ninety cents, compared to three dollars and fifty cents last year. The material used for a set of thin pajamas is about the same as a set of clothes, so each set costs eighteen dollars and fifty cents, compared to sixteen dollars and fifty cents last year. A person often hears that "summer dresses" are cheap. Organdy is a great material for making evening outerwear in this summer. Each yard costs two dollars and fifty cents. Of course, a person can buy six yards of it, take it to a tailor, and have them make a tight-fitting, connected skirt that looks very elegant on the body, as if waiting for her lover at the park entrance. This would cost thirty yuan. If you want something dazzling and unique, then a French-style blouse will cost eighty-five to one hundred yuan. Silk clothes cost at least one hundred yuan in high-end stores. It costs six to twelve yuan per yard. High-quality Chiva Ghee costs seven yuan and forty cents per yard. A person can make a dress with two and a half yards of material, but the style and workmanship will be lacking. If summer clothes are cheap, of course, many women will have to prepare to change clothes every three days. In this way, a person must have twelve washed long clothes, as well as clothes for banquets and dances. Hats are very expensive. Something that catches the eye always costs thirty yuan. The cheapest hat costs at least twenty yuan. A woman must have several hats in order to cope.</p>

<p>Xi Shen Film Company claims that its new film "Lipstick Hero" has been completely filmed and is of excellent quality. It is the company's most exciting product and the masterpiece of director Hu Zongli. Martial arts actress Wang Feijuan plays the daughter of a martial artist in the film, experiencing various difficulties and single-handedly saving her father. The plot is very tortuous. Shanghai Film Company claims that the film "Tofu Xishi," produced by the company and directed by Du Yu, starring Yin Mingzhu and Yuan Nongmei, will be released at the Central Grand Theater starting tomorrow (2nd). The plot of this film is extremely popular and the description is extremely clear. It initially depicts the vanity of a poor girl, then describes her indulging in singing and dancing and forgetting to return. Finally, it describes her regaining her original self after being subjected to various stimuli. The writing is both painful and profound, with a warning and inspiration. The Shanghai Girls' Glamorous Dance Troupe will be performing day and night, with nearly twenty actors. The play is titled "Magu Offering Longevity," an old play done in a new way, with excellent singing and dancing, as well as luxurious scenery, which is particularly outstanding.</p>
