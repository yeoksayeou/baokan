<p>移民問題爲日美間重大糾紛之一在日本方面以爲日本人口日益增加糧食之生產有限又加以震災之後農業狀况未即恢復故不得不急謀向外移民欲向外移民除滿蒙外只有向太平洋沿岸之美洲發展然而美國之取締移民甚爲嚴厲自一九二四年頒布新移民法律案限制日民入境於是日本之移民政策大受打擊在太平洋會議中一再表示反對必欲逹到取消該案目的而後已在美國方面則視黄色種人之侵入美洲爲莫大之危險故美洲西部各邦之法律對於外人取得土地權向即限制甚嚴因日本及中國之移民多趨集於美洲之西部而以日人爲尤多據美國統計日民在西部及太平洋沿岸一帶竟佔地方全人口百分七十以至百分八十之多美國懼日人勢力之膨漲故復急急焉頒此新移民之法律案雖經日本屢次交涉始終未有結果此問題之足以引起日美間之惡感已顯然可見者也</p>
<p>此次倫敦會議中之海軍問題日美已有妥協之表示則今之對於移民問題美國　竟照外人入境事務委員長之提議將前頒之法律案稍稍加以修正俾日僑入境之額數得以稍增亦未可知但仍恐未能滿足日本之意耳日本移民旣不得逞志於美洲惟有求容納於滿蒙之一途我國人對此亦不容不稍加注意矣</p>

<p>自從我們的（少奶奶的扇子）在校内和在上海演過之後我便深深地認識了這位良導師應雲衛先生設若我們的表演是成功了那我們只能說完全是應先生的成功因爲這全是應先生二月中辛辛苦苦督促引導的結果</p>
<p>我不知他有什麽樣的力量使得我們十幾個演員都服從敬仰他雖然他也只是位很年青的青年第一天我們遇見他便和他成了知己的朋友他雖是我們最有權勢的導演者但他對我們却很和靄即使有時他在發怒但是我們在他的怒容裏可以看出他火熱的心腸他把我們的事直看作是自己的事把公司的例假犧牲了把一個整個的年假和聖誕假也都犧牲了辛辛苦苦地在校裏作他導演的工作結果爲了連日價奔走在冰天雪地裏竟染了很重的傷風症病倒了我們去看望他他還在說（你們劇本要讀得很熟我病一好還要去替你們排演公演的時候一切後台前台的佈置都要我去照料）他這樣熱誠眞摯的對我們眞使我們感激得幾乎落涙了幸而不幾天就病愈了病愈之後他並不修養反而更努力的工作結果使得我們在校内公演得了不少的好趣在中央大會堂公演也得到了相當的估價他爲我們演這次劇不知損失了多少精神時間然而他並不懊悔惋惜而且在每次公演後他總和我們一樣的高興歡呼啊他眞是藝術的愛好者戲劇的擁護者</p>
<p>最近他更努力於提倡用國語在中國表演莎翁的劇本他選定莎翁傑作lhe　Merchant　of　Venice並請顧仲彝先生繙譯我對於這劇本和譯本不要說什麽只要說一說應先對於這劇導演的努力他對於劇裏的服裝丨歡洲十六世紀的服裝丨和當時威尼斯城的風俗習慣個而至於一雙手套一個燭奏都詳加研究他不願像現在的中國舞臺劇只憑着空想和揣測便估定了數百年前人民的服裝和一切的風俗習慣他是要認眞的幹他的志願是要把莎翁的劇本介紹給我們</p>

<h3 id="e6">The US Will Amend the Immigration Act <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>The immigration issue is one of the major disputes between Japan and the United States. Japan believes that its population is increasing day by day, the production of food is limited, and the agricultural situation has not yet recovered after the earthquake, so it has no choice but to seek overseas immigration urgently. Other than Manchuria and Mongolia, the only option for overseas immigration is to develop towards the Americas along the Pacific coast. However, the United States has very strict restrictions on immigration. Since the promulgation of the new Immigration Law in 1924, restricting the entry of Japanese citizens, Japan's immigration policy has been greatly affected. In the Pacific Conference, Japan repeatedly expressed its opposition and was determined to achieve the goal of abolishing the act before stopping. On the American side, the invasion of the yellow race into the Americas is regarded as a great danger. Therefore, the laws of the western states of the United States have always been very strict in restricting the right of foreigners to acquire land. Because immigrants from Japan and China mostly tend to gather in the west of the Americas, especially the Japanese. According to US statistics, Japanese citizens account for as much as 70% to 80% of the total local population in the west and along the Pacific coast. The United States is afraid of the expansion of Japanese power, so it hurriedly promulgated this new immigration law. Although Japan has repeatedly negotiated, there has been no result. The fact that this issue is enough to cause ill feelings between Japan and the United States is already obvious.</p>
<p>During the London Conference, Japan and the United States have reached a compromise on the naval issue. Now, regarding the immigration issue, the United States may actually amend the previously promulgated law slightly according to the proposal of the Chairman of the Foreign Entry Affairs Committee, so that the number of Japanese immigrants entering the country can be slightly increased. However, it is still feared that it will not be able to satisfy Japan's intentions. Since Japanese immigrants cannot achieve their ambitions in the Americas, they have no choice but to seek accommodation in Manchuria and Mongolia. Our countrymen should also pay a little attention to this.</p>

<h3 id="e7">Jin Army Opening to Zhengzhou is Blocked <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>A military agency in Nanjing received a telegram from Xuzhou today stating that, according to reconnaissance reports, Yan Xishan of Jin was quite panicked after hearing the news of the defeat. He urgently ordered Zhang Yinwu and Wang Jingguo, stationed in Beiping, to prepare their troops to fly south by train to provide support. The advance troops were heading to Zhengzhou and Zhongmu when they were suddenly blocked by Feng's troops and could not move forward. A portion of the troops were disarmed. Yan was extremely angry upon hearing the news and telegraphed Feng from Shijiazhuang, accusing him of not keeping his promise and disregarding the failure of the Jin army. He ordered the troops opening later to advance slowly. Another telegram said that the Jin army on the front line east of Zhongmu, hearing that Feng had intercepted reinforcements, was in a dilemma and abandoned their weapons to flee north across the river.

It is said that Chiang expressed that Zhang Gui and the two rebels were relying on the terrain of Guangxi Province, and it was not easy to completely eliminate them.

<p>The Authorities Are Greedy for Profit, Despise Righteousness, and Bomb the Innocent</p>
<p>Vietnamese Representatives Oppose Casting Confidence Vote</p>
<p>The Paris Republican Newspaper Advocates Justice</p>
<p>Paris News After the outbreak of the anti-French movement by the Vietnamese Party, the French newspapers held justice and did not regard the oppressive methods of the French authorities as correct. For example, the Paris (Republican) Republipue newspaper editorialized and criticized the Governor of Indochina, Bascou, and his first adjutant, Robin, for treating the Vietnamese with barbarous means. According to the newspaper, about 50 party members took refuge in Guamu Town, which had thousands of residents. Robin ordered the aircraft to throw bombs, killing many women, children, and old people who had nothing to do with the riot. The bombing was recognized by the Ministry of Colonies, but said that only ten people had died. The Republican also stated that Bascou and Robin convened the Election Council (jointly organized by French and Vietnamese representatives) in Hanoi in order to obtain a kind of vote of confidence, but when the motion to vote confidence in Barro was put forward, all the Vietnamese representatives withdrew from the parliament. When the meeting was reopened in the afternoon, only French representatives were present, but as a result, the vote of confidence was not passed. The newspaper concluded that Barro and his party were surrendered to the interests of big business, and the poor people were coerced and used their power to bully the weak for profit, which was despicable.

Italy's economic status is not inferior to that of other countries. Some may consider his political system to be different, but it should be known that his government is not a system of state officials, but a system that comes from the genuine efforts of the Blackshirt comrades. He is the creator of this system and should therefore be the guarantor of its revolution, people say.</p>

<p>Number of Opponents Insufficient to Veto Approval</p>
<p>Fears of Creating Excessive Sentiment for Peace</p>
<p>(Washington dispatch) Senator Borah, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, plans to conclude the committee's review of the London Naval Treaty this week and submit the treaty to the Senate for discussion and approval. The proposal may include some reservations, but it is unlikely to be adopted. According to informal investigations, there are a total of twenty-two senators opposing the naval treaty. However, the government believes this number is doubtful. Even if this number is accurate, twenty-three opposing votes are needed to veto the naval treaty. Currently, the argument against vetoing the naval treaty seems to be gaining momentum. One of the most powerful arguments is that if the United States rejects the naval treaty, naval construction competition will immediately resume throughout the world. However, both the high-seas navy faction and the White House have a concern: the vigorous attacks on the London Naval Treaty by Admirals Jones and Bristle and their demands for increased warship construction may create excessive sentiment for peace within Congress, making it difficult to pass even a budgetary proposal for a "treaty navy." (World)</p>
<p>(Associated Press, Washington, 24th) According to today's news, the London Naval Treaty will certainly be approved by the current session of Congress. President Hoover told leaders yesterday that if the current session of Congress does not approve it, he will convene a special session. According to leaders today, they expressed great sympathy for expediting the treaty. It would be difficult to obtain a quorum if a special session of Congress were convened in the summer. Although members of Congress are still far from unanimous on the London Naval Treaty, leaders deeply believe that since the president has resolutely decided not to shelve the treaty for discussion at the short session of Congress in December of this year, deliberately delaying the treaty by Congress would be of little use.</p>

<p>(National News Agency, Geneva, 24th) The next plenary session of the International League of Nations Assembly is scheduled to convene on September 10th. This meeting is extremely important. Its agenda includes the Security Committee's recommendations on providing financial assistance to attacked countries to reduce armaments and making the League of Nations Covenant suitable for the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Although disarmament issues are not included on the agenda, it is widely believed that the issue and Briand's memorandum on a European Union will be discussed.

<p>(National News Agency, Berlin, 24th) The Foreign Affairs Association held its annual meeting, attended by members of the diplomatic corps and several German cabinet members. German Chancellor Brüning was also present. Brüning gave an important speech, stating that after the cabinet was formed, the budget was passed by Congress, and then work began on laying the foundation for reforming German finances. The government's second most important plan will be to develop agriculture. Brüning then mentioned social legislation and finally commented on French Prime Minister Briand's European Union plan, saying that this grand doctrine must be created from the economic and political sovereignty concepts of each country. The German government will carefully study this plan of Europe's most famous politician with its own thoughts. Germany's revival can only be achieved through peaceful cooperation with other countries. Germany's goal lies in maintaining peace. Germany's policy originates from the treaty on maintaining peace through disarmament. For this reason, Germany will continue to show the world the reasons for Germany's self-disarmament, etc. The Papal Ambassador also delivered a speech, asking the participants to pay attention to Briand's remarks, acknowledging the moderation of the German people.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Paris, 24th) The Petit Parisien newspaper's Kida correspondent reports that when the French ship Asia, carrying pilgrims returning from Mecca, caught fire on Wednesday night in Kida, British sailors from the Arabistan ship climbed the iron cables and rescued five victims from the flames five times. It is estimated that about two hundred people died in the disaster. According to the survivors, the heat on the burning ship was extremely high, and many passengers who fell on the deck had their brains burst out like gun beads. Fifty passengers tried to escape along the iron ladder, but were forced back by the heat and then committed suicide by slitting their throats. Two lifeboats were submerged and many people drowned because passengers rushed to jump down. Many people did not want to escape, but still prayed to Mecca on the ship. Although the fire started on Wednesday night, it had not been extinguished by yesterday morning. There were about one thousand five hundred people on board, all of whom were pilgrims from the Red Sea ports. Unexpectedly, just as they were about to return home, they encountered this disaster.</p>

<p>(Xuzhou communication) According to front-line military news, the main force of the Central Army has already advanced to the old levee of the Yellow River in Lanfeng and is dividing forces to encircle it. The terrain of Lanfeng is very high, with the Central Henan Plateau to the west and the Eastern Henan Plain to the east, placing it in a commanding position. Therefore, the Jin Army and Sun Liangcheng's troops are relying on the dangerous terrain in the hopes of holding it. At the same time, the right wing of the Central Army, after defeating Liu Chunrong's and Guan Fuan's troops in Kaocheng, is advancing rapidly to the northwest and sending a detachment out of Lanfeng. The Central Army advancing from northern Hubei has also arrived in Qixian and joined forces with Liu Maoen's troops in Suixian south of the Longhai Railway, advancing towards Kaifeng. According to Xu Tingyao's report, the Jin Army's Sun Chu's troops abandoned up to eight hundred wounded soldiers on the battlefield during the Battle of Liuhe Longmen. All of them were rescued and treated by the Central Army's medical teams. When the Central Army pursued them to Yejigang, they captured more than 2,600 rifles. Gu Zhutong reported that after Liu Chunrong's troops were defeated, their remnants requested to be reorganized and were completely disarmed. Jiang Dingwen reported that they intercepted Zhao Chengshou's and Zheng Dazhang's troops and seized more than 3,000 rifles and cavalry rifles and more than 2,000 horses.

<p>(Jinan communication) Han Fuju, Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Corps, and He Yaozu, Military Counselor to the National Government, traveled by car from Jinan to Yuncheng on the 14th of this month to supervise the army. Recently, because the enemy troops in western Shandong have all retreated westward, and the issues of defense in northern Shandong and Shi Yousan's surrender need to be discussed by Han Fuju and Jiang Bocheng, Han Fuju telegraphed Jinan's First Army Corps Headquarters on the 19th to dispatch a special train to Jining to greet him. The chief of staff, Zhang Yue, escorted a special train to go. Today at 12:00 noon, Han Fuju's special train departed from Jining, passed Yanzhou at 1:00, passed Taian at 4:00, and arrived in Jinan at 6:30. Han and He Yaozu got off the train and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. They briefly talked about the victory of the Western Shandong battle on the platform and ordered the special train to be driven back to Jining quickly. Then, He Yaozu took a car to Jinan Hotel first. Han and Li Jinglin rested in the first-class lounge for a while. When I asked about the situation at the front, Han said that the original plan for the Western Shandong battle was to lure the enemy troops to the vicinity of Heze, Dingtao, and Cao County, and then gather and annihilate them. However, because Commander-in-Chief Jiang issued a general offensive order ahead of time, the enemy troops were met head-on by our army before they had penetrated deeply. Now they are retreating to the vicinity of Kaifeng and Zhengzhou. The Central Army's momentum is like a broken bamboo, and it will be able to join forces in Zhengzhou in three to five days. I went to Western Shandong this time to persuade Shi Hanzhang (Yousan) to obey the central government. Due to time constraints, I was unable to conduct detailed consultations. Shi's troops have also retreated to the vicinity of Zhengzhou, etc. At this point, Han and Li Jinglin returned to headquarters to rest. (23rd)</p>

<p>(Changsha communication) Zhang Gui's army has recently abandoned Guangxi and is planning to flee to Hunan and Jiangxi. Since the 13th of this month, the Gui army and Tang Shengming's troops have invaded Hunan through Gongcheng Longhuguan. However, Zhang Fakui's troops took a separate route through Quanzhou, attempting to spy on Yongzhou. He Jian received the report early and telegraphed Liu Jianxu, who had entered Guangxi, to prepare to intercept. On the 15th, Liu's division had deployed to meet the attack. He also telegraphed the central government to send additional aircraft to Hunan for support and urged the Eighth Route Army to pursue them fiercely in order to achieve a complete annihilation. The date of contact is expected to be in four or five days. Commander-in-Chief Jiang regarded Hunan Province as an important rear area and specially dispatched Liu Wendao, the mayor of Hankou, and senior staff officer Wen Susong to Changsha by Taikoo Company's Xiushan ship at 7:00 p.m. on the 22nd. They went to He Jian's private residence on Shahe Street to convey strategies for defending against Gui and inquire about the enemy's situation at the front. They convened senior cadres in the province overnight to determine the entire plan of operations and set a deadline for the various units at the front to assemble their forces within three days according to the plan. At the same time, they telegraphed the Sixth Route Army to enter Hunan for reinforcements and telegraphed Guangdong's Chen to send an air squadron to Hunan for assistance. At the same time, they telegraphed Chen Shaokuan to send four warships to Hunan to consolidate river defenses. As soon as the Sixth Route Army arrives in Hunan, He Jian will personally go to the front to command the attack. Liu Wendao is temporarily staying in Changsha at the Baonan Hotel. Wen Susong will go to Hengzhou in a day or two to meet Liu Jianxu and convey the important information.</p>

After reporting to the Central Government for approval, it issued a general order to the counties to prepare. Those that were delayed or had not yet expired due to the solicitation of probationary party members were held in advance to hold county representative congresses to elect representatives to attend the provincial representative congress. Now, the county representative congresses have been held one after another and have been reported to the province. The Provincial Executive Committee held its 109th committee meeting yesterday and publicly elected Supervisory Committee member Chen Guofu and Executive Committee member Xu Shaodi as chairmen of the presidium of the provincial representative congress.

<h3 id="e48">Seriousness of Grain Shortage in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Nanchang communication) Jiangxi was originally a rice-producing area, but the grain shortage this year is unprecedented. The reasons for the disaster are: (1) Since the spring of last year, there was no rain, and the planting period was delayed, and the rice seedlings did not develop well. (2) In the summer and autumn, drought demons raged, leaving the land barren for thousands of miles. Because of the long drought, insects were born, and locusts covered the sky after autumn, resulting in many drought-resistant late rice plants becoming withered and fruitless. (3) More than forty of the province's eighty-one counties have fallen to communist bandits. The fields are barren, and the houses are in ruins. Ordinary farmers not only have fields that are not cultivated, but also have no homes to return to. With these three major reasons, more than seventy counties in the province have reported disasters. It was still possible to barely get through last winter, but this spring, the image of famine has become apparent, and the sight of wandering and starving people is everywhere. Although the provincial government banned the export of rice and declined all parties' requests to purchase military rice from Jiangxi, the counties, anxious to protect themselves, all banned the export of rice by agreement. Place A cannot transport it to Place B, and Village B cannot move it to Villgage A. In addition to issuing a general order to the counties to ban the hoarding of grain and requiring the province to circulate it, the Department of Civil Affairs is also investigating the existing rice and grain in the counties in order to appropriately adjust surpluses and deficits. The results of the investigation show that the province's food supply is short by about 20 million dan. All sectors are at a loss for what to do. Then, a group of unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to hoard and manipulate, causing rice prices to skyrocket. In Nanchang, the price of rice in these two months has risen from 9 yuan and 6 jiao per dan to over 19 yuan. A group of poor people work all day long and cannot get enough to eat. Panic has suddenly appeared in society, and beggars are almost everywhere in the streets. The social order has also been greatly affected. The prisoners in the First Prison and the beggars in the beggar shelter almost rioted because of lack of food. As for the outer counties, in Linchuan, because hungry people could not find food, they looted more than 100 rice stores in the entire city. In Jingdezhen, hundreds of thousands of porcelain workers, seeing that the rice source was cut off, also rioted a few days ago and robbed food. At first, they robbed rice stores, and then they robbed food stores. All edible items in the town, regardless of whether they were raw or cooked, were robbed. In Poyang County, because of the scarce source of rice, County Magistrate Jiang Bozhang persuaded the people of the county to eat only two meals a day. Former Yihuang County Magistrate Zhou was paraded through the streets bound and tied by local people because he brought a boatload of rice and grain to the province. In Jing'an County, a farmer was killed by his clan in the ancestral hall because he had more than a dozen dan of grain and refused to lend it to the villagers. In a village near Nanchang, two liters of rice caused a tragedy of five lives. The seriousness of the situation can be seen. A group of current officials and civilians are working hard to find relief measures: (1) The Department of Civil Affairs has formulated regulations on the circulation of grain within the province for the counties to follow. (2) The provincial government telegraphed the central government to allocate funds for disaster relief. (3) The counties set up civil food holding societies to handle all matters related to civil food and price stabilization. (4) The provincial capital is holding food registration and raising funds to go to Shanghai to purchase foreign rice (estimated at more than 500,000 dan) and distributing it in nine districts at stable prices. The provincial party headquarters and the provincial government convened a joint party and government meeting to discuss the overall relief plan to avoid an accident caused by the rice shortage.

<h3 id="e49">Opposition to Japanese Mine Blocking Traffic <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>(Shenyang communication) In order to avoid economic disadvantages in collecting Fushun County Street, the Japanese are implementing blockade work, seizing and blocking two official roads and one river in the Qiujialouzi important pass that connect the county street to Fengcheng and Benxi counties. At the same time, they are posting announcements in our territory prohibiting passage. This road is the lifeline of Fushun County. Since the Japanese side's extra-legal actions, the county magistrate of the county and leaders of various agencies and legal groups have repeatedly gone to the coal mine to protest to the Japanese side. The Japanese Vice-Minister of the mine, Kubo, met with them in his capacity as the person in charge. After serious questioning, he did not give a formal reply, but only promised to remove the announcement. The work of digging ditches and blocking roads has not stopped. The people of the county are extremely angry. Recently, they convened a citizen's road-struggle meeting. Leaders of various legal groups, local gentry, and representatives of all 113 villages in the county attended. As a result, they went to the county government together and asked County Magistrate Zhang Kexiang to seriously negotiate with the Japanese mine to stop the road blockade work and restore the original traffic. Subsequently, the Fushun National Diplomacy Association organized a road-struggle office at the Youth Association in County Street and divided it into five departments: general affairs, documents, accounting, investigation, and auditing. It issued a declaration to the party headquarters of various provinces and cities, military and civilian officials, and various French countries, calling for unified assistance. The following is an excerpt from the declaration:</p>
<p>In recent years, the Japanese have used their imperialism to oppress our nation, seize our land, and trample on our sovereignty more and more severely. The people of our Northeast have suffered doubly and are in unspeakable pain and unable to cope. The exploitation and suffering that are most deeply concerned are none other than the people of Fushun. If Fushun is a mining area, the contact is more frequent and the conspiracy is more serious. Here, we painfully appeal to our government and people. After the Japanese defeated Russia and occupied the coal mine, it has been recognized by the world. However, according to the treaties concluded between the two countries, it is only limited to mining as a principle and may not infringe on the land rights and property rights of our nationals. Furthermore, according to the agreement negotiated by the two governments, our country extracts 5% of the wellhead tax for every 100 tons. According to this agreement, the land rights are based on the original territory and have not been lost. The mine is commercial in nature and must not be forcibly taken. However, the mine considers its business nature to be a lease nature. Therefore, it has set up police, handled postal affairs, and stationed garrison troops, all kinds of illegal acts. Its ambition and aggression and its destruction of public justice are all listed one by one. Since the coal mine is commercial in nature, Japan has no reason to forcibly demand it from the residents of the area. However, the coal mine authorities are reckless and disregard this. They forcibly buy the land in the mining area. If the purchase is unsuccessful, they will then collapse it. Resident Chen Xiufeng refused to buy it, resulting in the entire family being trapped. The case is stored in the office. This is their destruction of public justice. Zhaizhai Street is located in the center of the mining area. The county government and other agencies and businesses in our country gather here, making it difficult to give up. The coal mine authorities are trying to implement a plan to seize Zhaizhai Street, so they moved the Fushun branch railway station to a new location and opened Shanzuizi as a commercial port, doing their best to operate it. Our country's officials and businessmen are trying to build it to resist in order to protect the national territory. Therefore, the Japanese coal mine authorities have come up with hundreds of schemes to steal underground rights and excavate privately in order to collapse our county street and destroy our construction. Last summer, they made the county street in poor condition, which is obvious to all. This is their destruction of public justice. The coal mine authorities have been implementing a plan to block our county street for several years. Residents near the important traffic road on the west road who mistakenly pass through have been brutally killed. At that time, our people were under pressure and took into account the national friendship and had other ways to go, so they tolerated and understood. Unexpectedly, the Japanese were ruthless and took an inch. Suddenly, after April 10 of this year, they blocked the main road to the south of our county street, which is the throat for traffic, at the Chengjiakan key pass. It is found that there are two official streets in the southeast direction from County Street. One of them was previously blocked. In addition, a river is an important thoroughfare for pedestrians, vehicles, and horses in the southeast village, and it is also the gate for citizens to enter and exit. The prosperity of the county street market depends on it. The coal mine authorities are eliminating the prosperity of the county street, so they are cutting off our arms and choking our throats, wanting to put our people to death and then be happy. This is their destruction of public justice. At the same time, they erected signs in our territory, openly notifying all our country's merchants and people to be uniformly prohibited from passing through, treating our nation as a conquered nation and treating our country as a conquered country. Their barbarism and rudeness have reached this extreme, which is their destruction of public justice. The road to Zhaizhai Street was originally our country's old road and was not transferred. The coal mine authorities did not obtain the consent of our country's officials and people in advance, but actually seized and implemented the blockade work. Afterwards, it was discovered that our country's agencies and legal groups had repeatedly protested, but they were met with verbal perfunctory work as usual. This is their destruction of public justice.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Case of Eight Murders Cracked in Shenyang <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The net of heaven has large meshes, but it lets nothing through.</p>
<p>The souls of the wronged possess the murderer to confess.</p>
<p>The case of the cruel murder of eight people at the residence of Li Jingzhou, former Daoyin (Circuit Intendant) of Heilongjiang, in Haoran Lane, a commercial area in Shenyang, shocked the entire city more than ten days ago. The police authorities racked their brains and exhausted all means of investigation, but to no avail. Later, based on the report of Shang, the father-in-law of the deceased Li Peiqin (eldest son of Li Jingzhou), it was said that two people named You Qisan and Pi Guochen had been living in the Li household before the incident, and after the incident, the two disappeared. They were highly suspected, so detectives were dispatched separately. You Qisan was captured first, but his confession was ambiguous and no definite evidence was obtained. Subsequently, Pi Guochen was captured in Changtu, and he was immediately escorted to the provincial capital for interrogation. He confessed to the murder without denial, saying that he committed the crime together with You Qisan and another person named Deng Haiquan, and the reason was purely for revenge. After being detained, at about 11 o'clock in the evening, Bai Zijing, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, fearing that there might be injustice even though the murderer had been arrested, personally interrogated Pi Guochen. Pi seemed to be half-asleep and his mind was wandering. Then he burst into tears, jumping and roaring wildly. The court police stopped him but he would not listen (the prisoner Pi was wearing heavy shackles on his feet, making it difficult to move, but he had such strength now, which was considered strange). He insisted on saying, "Let me kowtow to the Chief of the Department to seek justice and avenge my family! My whole family died so tragically!" Seeing this, Chief Bai ordered cold water to be splashed on his face to sober him up. After a while, prisoner Pi repeated his request, crying out more loudly, "Who are you?" he was asked. He replied, "I am Li Peiqin. I died so tragically! Please avenge me!" He also said, "All eight of us are here, kowtowing and begging!" After hearing this, Chief Bai and others were terrified and immediately ordered him to be taken back to prison and strictly ordered the arrest of Deng Haiquan for interrogation. At this time, prisoner Pi still seemed to be half-awake and his face was extremely ferocious. It is said that science is flourishing today and the talk of ghosts and gods is illusory and unfounded. But now, seeing this event, it proves that the saying "the wronged have a head and debts have an owner" is not false. The above was told to the reporter by a friend in the Public Security Bureau who witnessed the incident, and it was told with certainty, so it is specially recorded. It is also heard that when prisoner Pi was sober, he confessed that at about 11 o'clock that night, he and You and Deng committed the murder, one person handling the people in one room. Pi was the one who murdered Li Peiqin and his wife. After the incident, prisoner Pi returned to Changtu to live, but he always slept uneasily at night and his traces were occasionally revealed. If ghosts and gods are truly real, then the capture of Deng Haiquan is just around the corner.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Overseas Chinese in Russia Still Suffer Abuse <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>Recent Talks by Those Returning from Russia</p>
<p>Russia's New Communist System Implemented This Year</p>
<p>Russian Government Restricts Overseas Chinese from Returning Home</p>
<p>A Harbin dispatch on the 20th: Since the beginning of March, there have been four groups of overseas Chinese returning from Russia. The first group was 150 people, the second group was 86 people, the third group was 107 people, and the fourth group, which arrived in Harbin today, was 99 people. Regarding the abuse of overseas Chinese by the Russian side, from the Khabarovsk Agreement to the current Sino-Russian conference, our overseas Chinese are still living an inhuman life in foreign lands. According to the overseas Chinese who returned home today, they were all engaged in small businesses in the areas of Zeya and Chita in Russia. Before the Sino-Russian problem occurred, they had suffered all kinds of abuse from the Russian side. For example, when opening a store and obtaining a permit, they would be subjected to various difficulties by the officials. Unless a large amount of money was spent, the permit would never be obtained. After the business was established, there were various exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, totaling at least three-fifths of the business income each month. Therefore, overseas Chinese, although nominally doing business, were actually like managers hired by others, suffering from the monthly oppression of shareholders. However, at that time, when returning home, they could still bring out (Chernetz)</p>
<p>200 Russian rubles. Since the incident on the Middle East Road, merchants have been arrested and imprisoned, and their property and goods have been confiscated. Since August 31, overseas Chinese in various places have been arrested and imprisoned one after another. The abuse in prison was even worse. As for food, 16 people were given one heavy loaf of black bread weighing three and a half jin per day, causing the strong, the young, and the old to suffer from hunger and emaciation. After being imprisoned for four months, they were released after the Khabarovsk agreement was reached. At that time, they had no home to return to and no place to live. Those who requested the Russian authorities to return the confiscated property were arrested and imprisoned again. Therefore, the overseas Chinese were afraid of the cruel prison life and would rather starve to death on the road than make any demands on the Russians. Recently, Russia has implemented a new communist system for a period of five years, confiscating privately owned property and returning it to the government. The government then provides food on a per capita basis, but those who do not work are still not allowed to eat. Workers are allowed to receive nine taels of black bread a day with a certificate and a monthly salary of more than ten yuan. This is only enough for a single person to support themselves. Families with several members often experience tragic events such as hanging and suicide. Public grievances are increasing day by day. Under such circumstances, overseas Chinese are discriminated against by the Russians regardless of whether they join the labor union or not. This is because after the war last year, the Russians felt that the Chinese communist elements were unreliable. At the same time, they are not as active as they were in the past in enticing Chinese to join the party. Since overseas Chinese in Russia are not allowed to do business or work, they have been thinking about returning home. However, fearing that the Chinese would expose the truth after returning home, the Russian side strictly restricts passports. Those who receive a passport to return home must pay taxes, ranging from hundreds of yuan, with no fixed amount and determined by the person. Therefore, some people have been applying for several months without success. There are more than 30,000 overseas Chinese in the areas of Chita and Verkhneudinsk. Because of the difficulty in obtaining passports and the lack of travel expenses, they cannot return home. Those who receive passports to return home are subjected to extremely strict inspections by the Red Russian military and police checkpoints along the way. At the 18-li Xiaozhan station on the border of Manchuria, they are subjected to strip searches, and their clothes and shoes are searched. If they carry even one Russian ruble, they will be sent back for detention. Therefore, overseas Chinese returning from Russia are penniless. When they arrive at Manzhouli in Chinese territory, fortunately, local organizations provide relief, giving each person one yuan for pocket money, one jin of white flour, and one sheng of millet.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Jiaojiao Railway Committee</p>
<h3 id="e52">Sa Fujun Arrives at the Bureau to Take Office <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Qingdao dispatch: Sa Fujun, the newly appointed chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, arrived in Qingdao at 2:00 p.m. on the 21st aboard the Shenwan ship. Senior officials in the bureau welcomed him at the pier. After exchanging greetings with the welcoming personnel, Mr. Sa went to the Qianhaiya Hotel to rest. Then, committee members Zhou Zhongqi, Cui Shijie, and Lu Mengxiong, accompanied him to the bureau and met with all the staff in the auditorium. Lu Mengxiong first gave a welcome speech on behalf of the committee. After the speech, Sa gave a speech, saying that since he was transferred to the ministry last year and separated from his colleagues, it has been nine months. While in the ministry, he often heard that the reorganization of the railway was progressing well, such as the repayment of Japanese debts, which had been determined with a plan, and the operating income had also increased compared to the past. The reconstruction of bridges and construction projects were being completed one after another. All of this was due to the efforts and diligence of his colleagues, which was greatly appreciated by the ministry. This time, Chairman Yan resigned from his post and went to Beijing. The ministry repeatedly tried to retain him, but Yan's intention to resign was firm and he was granted his request and continued to serve as a technical supervisor. He was ordered to come here. He considered himself to be incapable, but the committee members were mostly old friends. In the future, all matters should still be handled by the committee responsibly, and work together to plan for progress. He said that there are about two matters that should be paid attention to in the future regarding railway administration: 1. Employment. All colleagues serving here are serving the Jiaoji Railway, not serving private individuals. Even if the leader changes, the colleagues in office will not be transferred. The ministry adopts a talent-based approach to employing people on all roads, and specialized talents must be strongly protected. The law on the protection of technical personnel has already been promulgated. In addition, laws on the protection of vehicle affairs, accounting, and other personnel are also being drafted. It is hoped that all employees will work with peace of mind and not fail the ministry's good intentions to maintain them. 2. Finance. Although the operating income of the road has increased, the sharp increase in gold prices and the repayment of foreign debts have resulted in a budget deficit of more than 2 million yuan for the 19th year. In the future, financial resources must be conserved. However, saving is not just about reducing government administration and laying off employees. It is necessary to invest funds in profitable areas and not spend too much in the profit-sharing area. He hoped that his colleagues would pay close attention to this. It is heard that Mr. Sa will first come to the bureau to inspect matters starting today because the bureau is busy. The date of the formal swearing-in ceremony has not yet been determined (May 22).</p>

<p>Xiaodanyang Town in Dangtu is adjacent to Jiangning County. A few days ago, dozens of bandits suddenly came to the town. They started robbing at 9:00 a.m. and took the loot away at 3:00 p.m. Almost no businessman or resident in the town was spared from the huge losses. By the time the county government sent troops to suppress the bandits, they had gone far away. Two companies of the Wuhu Garrison Regiment were transferred from Digang yesterday to pursue the bandits.</p>
<p>There were many bandits hiding in Yuncao Town in Hanshan. They claimed to be the "Number One Army in the World." The Wuhu Garrison Regiment cracked their secret organization in the Dongji Hotel in Wubu, Wuhu. In addition to sending the arrested Chen Yufu and others to the capital for legal proceedings, they also sent troops to Yuncao to search for the bandits, but they had all fled upon hearing the news. Last night, the Military and Police Inspection Office and the Public Security Bureau successively arrested more than ten people, including Ding Changqing, in Henan and Liuchunyuan and other places. They were immediately sent to the regimental headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<p>Recently, bandits have also been found entrenched in the local area of Chaoxian, harassing the residents. According to reports, Battalion Commander Luo Yousheng of the Second Battalion of the Wuhu Garrison Regiment, led by Regiment Commander Lu, took soldiers on a small steamer yesterday to suppress the bandits.</p>
<p>Zhang Siwei, the magistrate of Wuwei County, previously initiated a joint defense of Wuhu with Wuwei, Fanchang, Luhe, Chaoxian, Hexian, and Hanshan Counties because bandits in southern Anhui were moving from one place to another to evade suppression. Now, Xuanzhou, Nanling, and Dangtu Counties, which are mostly adjacent to the counties, have also joined the joint defense, forming a ten-county joint defense. A joint bandit suppression meeting is planned to be held in Wuhu soon to eliminate the bandits. (24th)</p>

<p>Record of Hearing of a Family Lawsuit: The divorce case between Yang Shijie and Yang Chen Yunyu outside the East Gate has been appealed by Shijie to the Jiangsu High Court after the initial judgment was rejected. The court ordered a reconciliation, and both parties agreed and signed. They also stayed in the same room in a Suzhou hotel that night to reunite their dream of marriage. However, Yunyu's divorce decree was made clear. However, Yunyu was not satisfied with her husband's sister, Yang Cuilan, leaving home alone to stay at the Chengnian Women's School in the home of the clan chief, Yang Shen. The clothes, porcelain, bamboo, and wooden utensils that she had given were all in her husband's house. According to Gu A'mei, who was hired by Yang Cuilan, all the items were annihilated and destroyed by the eldest lady in order to accuse Yunyu of escaping with her luggage and instigate her younger brother Shijie to file for divorce. Yunyu, having learned of Cuilan's plot, went to the Women's Association to seek assistance. The association sent someone with the witness, Gu Xiaomei, to Yang's house for inspection. Cuilan was visiting Ning, and only her husband's younger brother, Bangjie, was left at home. According to the witness, Gu Xiaomei, the porcelain and copper utensils were pulled out of the well, which were Yunyu's belongings. Clothes and miscellaneous items were found in the house. Bangjie was supervised to take notes and everyone on the scene signed and handed them over to Bangjie for management. Yunyu, having obtained proof of Cuilan's concealment and slander, filed a criminal lawsuit with the county government, accusing Yang Cuilan of annihilating and damaging stolen goods. The case was previously summoned to collect original interrogations, ordered Yang Cuilan to post bail, and supplement witnesses. Yesterday (24th) was the first hearing, and the whole city was shocked. Five to six hundred people from far and near came to listen to the hearing. At 9:30 p.m., the court could not open the trial, so it was temporarily changed to a flower hall to set up seats for questioning. Du Cheng, the trial officer, summoned Yang Shen, the female clan chief, who said that Yunyu was her nephew's wife and had been oppressed by her husband's sister, Cuilan, even to the point of not giving her food. She had no choice but to stay temporarily in her house. She also stated that after the divorce reconciliation in the Suzhou High Court, the couple slept in the same bed in the hotel that night, which shows that there was no rift in the husband and wife's relationship. Unexpectedly, Shijie had another objection after returning home. Gu Xiaomei, the witness, testified that she worked in the eldest lady's (Cuilan) place, so she personally witnessed the concealment and damage of the plaintiff's dowry and clothing, but her conscience was disturbed, so she dared to testify about the damage to bamboo and wooden utensils and the location of concealment. After questioning, the defendant, Yang Cuilan, testified that she was 33 years old and still unmarried. She did not admit to any of the points accused by the plaintiff and pointed out that Yunyu did not have many dowry items, all of which had been taken away. When Yang Shijie was questioned, he also insisted that his wife had strange and inferior character and that all the points accused were false and fabricated. The sister and brother began to bow their heads and say nothing after being refuted one by one by the witnesses. The plaintiff firmly requested that the defendant be handed over to the questioning palace, advising Shijie that if the family was so discordant, he should not listen to one side of the story and oppress his wife. He also advised Yang Cuilan that because of her bad intentions and methods, she should be taken into custody, but she was leniently given five days to hand over the original items, otherwise she would be judged according to law. After the announcement, she was handed over to the original guarantor to leave the court, which was already late at twelve o'clock. However, Yang Cuilan's original guarantor was unwilling to take responsibility and changed to the local guarantor to watch over her before regaining her freedom this morning. The enthusiasm of the Song people for this case is unprecedented in recent years.</p>

On the previous day, Wang used a hemp rope to tie his wife's throat, causing her to be strangled to death. The township chief reported the case to Pan, the director of the Huangdu Public Security Bureau. After receiving the report, he immediately sent police to arrest Wang and reported it to the county government for inspection. The inspection confirmed that she had been beaten and strangled to death before her death.

<p>Gunshots and Shadows of Blood Before Miao Bin's Residence: Inside the South Gate of this County, under the Bianmin Bridge, the front and rear gates of the mansion of Miao Bin, former Director of the Civil Affairs Department of Jiangsu Province, are guarded. The police officers on duty last night from 9:00 PM to 12:00 AM were Song Shaolun, a first-class policeman from the First Public Security Bureau (at the front gate of the Miao residence), and Meng Jie, a police trainee (at the rear gate of the Miao residence). About half an hour after they took over, two thugs dressed in short clothes came to the front gate of the Miao mansion and talked with the guard Song Shaolun for a while. Suddenly, the two thugs took out pistols and opened fire on Song Shaolun, hitting him in the right chest, penetrating the lung, and exiting from the back. After being injured, Song pulled out his Mauser pistol to fight back, but the two thugs fired another shot, hitting the left (south) side of the glass window of the nearby Puren Hospital's clinic. Song also returned fire, firing two shots in succession, but both missed. Song then rushed to the Liedi Temple to report to the police station. Because of excessive bleeding and severe pain from his injuries, he collapsed. Guo Xikun, a policeman on duty under the Nanshi Bridge, sent him to Puren Hospital for treatment and rushed to the police station to report. Patrol Chief Xu Yunsheng led police officers to pursue the attackers. At the same time, Magistrate Sun received the report and immediately ordered the closure of all city gates and implemented martial law. He personally led the police force to search for the thugs. Huang Zhenquan, Director of the Public Security Bureau, Mao Mujun, Director of the Water Police District, and others also led detectives to investigate everywhere, but the two thugs had already fled far away, and nothing was gained. Police officer Song Shaolun's injuries are quite serious. According to general speculation, the thugs did not seem to be robbers intending to steal property, but rather came specifically to seek revenge on Song Shaolun.</p>
<p>Tragic News of a Cargo Ship Robbed in Taihu Lake: Xu Jianshan (63 years old), a resident of Xu Lane, Ninety-ninth Tu, Fourteenth District (Kaihua Township) of this county, has been operating a general merchandise and meat store called Xu Xichang in Suzhou Dongting Xishan Luzhu, transporting goods back and forth on the lake for more than ten years. On the 15th of this month, Xu Jianshan took the Xihu steamer back to Wuxi to purchase goods. On the 19th, he hired Shao Qiaosheng (53 years old), a lake boatman, from Wanbu Port in this township to sail to Xishan Luzhu. Shao, along with his eldest son Guoqing (23 years old), second son Qiqing (7 years old), and Xu Jianshan, a total of four people, loaded 14.5 shi of white rice, 2 dan of soybeans, 2 dan of soybean oil, 2 dan of soy sauce, 4 jars of shochu, and 8 large pigs onto the boat. At 10:00 AM, they set sail from Zigang and exited the port. Unexpectedly, while traveling on the lake near Raozhu, they were suddenly robbed by lake bandits, suffering heavy losses. Xu Jianshan and the boatmen Shao Qiaosheng, Guoqing, and Qiqing were all killed. The Xu family was alarmed upon hearing the news. Until the day before yesterday, the Xu family received a special report from the Wuxikou Lifesaving Bureau stating that an ownerless sunken boat was found there. Bloodstains were found all over the boat, and there were also four pairs of shoes of various sizes. Yesterday, Xu Jianshan's son, Quanfu, filed a complaint with the Public Security Bureau, requesting the pursuit and arrest of the murderers, and also placed an advertisement to search for the bodies.</p>
<p>Verdict in the Case of Forcible Rape of a Virgin: Xi Aqin (16 years old), daughter of Xi Ronglin, a villager from the Qiantoutou Township of Yanqiao Town in this county, worked at the Minfeng Silk Factory outside the South Gate. On April 1st, she was tricked by Fan Qinsheng (nickname "Big Hand Aqi"), a fellow villager, to the Luhai Inn on the road, where he raped her. After her father, Xi Ronglin, learned of this, he twisted Fan and took him to the Fifth District Office, who transferred him to the county government for detention. Yesterday afternoon, Examining Officer Zhou Cheng summoned Xi Aqin and her father, Xi Ronglin, to court for interrogation. Xi Aqin testified, "I was indeed raped by him." Fan Qinsheng testified, "It was not rape, Aqin willingly had an affair with me," etc. Mr. Zhou reviewed the testimonies and reasoned that raping a 16-year-old girl, even consensual intercourse, is considered rape. Therefore, he sentenced Fan Qinsheng to seven years of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Silkworm Cocoon Markets in Various Townships Open One After Another: The silkworm cocoon markets in various townships of Wuyi opened one after another on the 23rd and 24th. An investigation of cocoon prices in various places showed that they ranged from 45 to 50 yuan. According to the usual practice in previous years, the price of cocoons of inferior quality was also collected at the beginning of the market, and the price of small, better quality cocoons also increased gradually. This year, the color of the silk is not good, so the goods will not be piled up. It is expected that the price will rise in the future. The most lively cocoon market in this county is the Northeast Township. The three companies of Qishuyan Taijiang Fuchang and Li Tongyi in that area opened on the 24th, and the cocoon price was collected up to 50 yuan, but the goods were not yet crowded. The cocoon prices and collection situation of the cocoon markets near Hengshan Bridge are the same as those in Qishuyan. The Zhengda Cocoon Market in Hetou Bridge borrowed 50,000 yuan from the Wuxi Zhenyi Silk Factory to rent and collect cocoons. It opened on the 24th and collected more than 50 dan of fresh cocoons, at a general price of 51 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Further Appointment of the Post Office Director: Zhang Yunwen, the second-class post office director of Wuyi County, recently received an order from the Jiangsu Postal Administration to transfer him and further appoint Cheng Taoshi as his replacement.

<p>Yongzhen Township to Form a Defense Corps: The county government, based on a petition from Wu Da, a representative of the people of Yongzhen Township, requested the restoration of the Anfen Police Station in the town, because it is located at a vital transportation hub between north and south, and robberies and burglaries are frequently heard. Without a police station, it is insufficient to maintain local security. Yesterday (the 22nd), it was specifically approved that, since a fixed case is difficult, the organization of a defense corps should be organized according to regulations to supplement the insufficient police force.</p>

<p>Continuing Interrogation of the Gang-Related Kidnapping Organization Smashed in Puyuan: The Hangzhou Provincial Public Security Bureau's detective team uncovered a kidnapping organization in a thatched shed near Yangjia Bang in the western part of Puyuan Town, Jiaxing, and rescued one hostage. Two bandits were arrested on the spot, and wooden-cased guns and pistols were seized. Later, two female bandits were arrested at the home of a Guixing in the West Market of Puyuan Town. All the witnesses who were arrested were taken to Hangzhou to be interrogated. According to an investigation, the hostage was indeed a person from Dayun, Jiashan, who was kidnapped at the end of last year. A letter was sent to his family, and after several negotiations, a ransom of 10,000 yuan was required. It is said that 7,000 yuan had already been paid somewhere, and the remaining 3,000 yuan was scheduled to be paid at a hotel in Hangzhou this month. Initially, the hostage was hidden in another place, but at the beginning of March, he was moved to a hole in the thatched shed. Wax candle oil was poured into both ears to prevent him from hearing sounds. The detective team obtained a clue from a certain source and arrested the bandits in Puyuan. The kidnappers fired guns in the thatched shed to resist arrest. The detectives also fired back. Eventually, the kidnappers were defeated and arrested. The hostage was found in the hole. The hostage had suffered greatly in the hole, so he was like a wooden chicken and his nerves had become abnormal. The thatched shed at that location has already been burned down.</p>

<p>The Establishment of the Zhangzhen Embankment Affairs Bureau is Unlikely: The embankments in Zhangzhen, including Basha, Qishan, and Jiulian Wantou, protect thousands of acres of farmland. Their situations are actually interconnected. However, the division of responsibilities and the lack of mutual assistance spirit among the directors, the temporary donations, the absence of savings in the hands of the embankment owner, and the lack of disaster prevention preparations mean that the entire town is located in a low-lying area. Once flooded, it becomes a major disaster. County Magistrate Zhang Jingxu had previously inspected the town and believed that it was of great importance to the people's livelihood. He advocated setting up an embankment affairs bureau to take on its responsibility, so that it could gather the strength of the masses to easily accomplish the task. He presented a request to the provincial authorities and approved 3,000 yuan to subsidize the embankment expenses. He also extended an invitation to many embankment directors in the town to attend a meeting to discuss future strategies. However, no embankment director attended the second scheduled meeting. Zhang was quite indignant that the establishment of the embankment affairs bureau was unlikely.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 24th (Our Report) It was long expected that the track and field championship of this games would go to Japan, but their excellent results are truly astonishing. All eleven new records of the games were created by Japanese athletes (in which Japan and the Philippines shared a new record for high jump). Japanese athletes monopolized almost all the places in the field events. The Philippines also sighed in inferiority.

<p>Soccer: Hope to Beat Japan</p>
<p>Tennis: Relying Entirely on the Efforts of Qiu and Lin</p>
<p>Basketball Team: Hopeless After Two Losses</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Our Report) In the track and field competition in the past two days, Japan scored high and won the championship. In tomorrow's China-Japan baseball game, Japan is confident. The Japanese athletes are all national elites, and it is not easy for China to deal with them. As for soccer, Japan has failed in previous games, but they have been practicing hard in recent years and have made great progress, so today they actually defeated the Philippines 7 to 2. Chinese soccer players are superior in terms of individual skills, and it is hopeless to aim to win a medal. If they lose again, their ranking will fall to third. Although the Japanese team is very strong in volleyball this year, China, although defeated by the Philippines, still has hope of winning. In tennis, Japan has already shown its skills and returned victorious from the Manila Carnival before, so it is confident that it can defeat China. If Mr. Qiu and Mr. Lin cannot fight hard, it may be difficult to maintain their championship.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 25th (Our Report) The Chinese basketball team was defeated by Japan for the first time. Last night at 8:00 PM, it was poisoned by the Philippines again. The championship of this game has been declared hopeless. In last night's China-Philippines game, the Philippines won 39 to 34. In the first half, the score was tied at 19. In the second half, the Philippines scored five more points to win the final victory. Thousands of spectators were extremely excited. China and the Philippines each had cheerleading squads to cheer each other and boost morale. The Philippines' victory depended on the accuracy of its long throws. China's Lu Zhong'en missed opportunities under the enemy's basket time and time again. The whole game was clean and agile. As soon as the whistle sounded, both sides hunted each other. Two minutes later, the Philippines' McLina scored the first point. Liu Jianchang returned a point. Yao Enhan made a free throw. Since then, the Philippines' momentum suddenly increased. McLina was the giant of their team. Tang Yao found it difficult to monitor his activities. Liu Jianchang tried to throw from a distance many times, and all of them were successful, resulting in twelve equal scores. Cheers from the audience shook the whole venue, rising and falling. Each side scored 19 points in the first half.</p>

Unfortunately, Li Guoshen and Lu Zhong'en made consecutive mistakes, immediately giving the Philippines hope. Li Guoshen scored two goals and made three free throws. Before long, Li Guoshen fouled out and was replaced by Liu Guanjun. The situation was not good and it was difficult to reverse the victory. They finally failed with a score of 34 to 29.</p>

<p>This newspaper, Tokyo, 25th: The track and field competition concluded today. The complete competition situation is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Triple Jump</p>
<p>The Chinese athletes participating in various events fell behind, and it seemed likely that they would repeat the previous session's failure. Unexpectedly, in the triple jump, where Japan and the Philippines competed fiercely, the Chinese Situ Guang emerged as a dark horse. On his fifth jump, he achieved 13.70 meters, surprisingly ranking fourth and earning one point for China. As a result, China's track and field team was spared the shame of a complete defeat. When the announcer reported the results, the entire audience stood up and cheered loudly. The first place was the Japanese Tetsuda.</p>
<h3 id="e96">(2) 100 Meters <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Each of Japan and the Philippines had three participants in the final. China's Liu Changchun was injured and did not participate. Zhou Zhaoyuan and Hao Chunde were penalized during the preliminary rounds and lost their qualification. Japan's Yoshioka had a very fast start and led until the end. The Filipino Chen Jagga won third place. The Japanese Nambu Laiyu finished fourth with a final thrust of his chest. The Filipino Nipoonsina was fifth. Cun Xu can be said to have won narrowly. Yoshioka's score was 10.8 seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Shot Put <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese won completely, with four athletes ranking and all breaking the previous Filipino Rapia's record of 14.23 meters. This was truly a triumphant achievement for the Japanese. (1) Takada 15.80 meters (2) Aono 15.01 meters (3) Yoshikawa 14.42 meters (4) Nishida 14.29 meters. The Chinese Lu Ming 13.03 meters and Pan Nanshun 11.92 meters were still far behind the Japanese.</p>

<p>In the preliminary rounds the day before, China's Liu Changchun initially stole twice and was warned by the starter. On the third start, he was too slow to start and fell far behind. He was unable to catch up and got fourth place, thus being eliminated. In yesterday's final, there were four Japanese and two Filipino athletes.</p>
<p>Pole vaulting, first place, Japanese Nishida Shuhei's posture</p>
<p>The first place was the Japanese Nakajima, who achieved an excellent score of 49.2 seconds, a new record. The second place was the Japanese Nishi Shinichi, and the third place was the Filipino He Yi. The fourth place was Nishihara Takashi.</p>

<p>The competition between the Japanese and Filipino athletes was very fierce, with each having three participants. The Japanese Miki was exceptionally fast, leading the second place Filipino Casias by one and a half meters. Third and fourth place were both Filipinos. The Japanese Miki's time of 15.4 seconds was a new Far Eastern record.</p>

<p>The competition among China, Japan, and the Philippines was quite interesting. There were nine participants. China's Li Zhongsan jumped over 1.80 meters, but was eliminated at 1.84 meters. The Filipino Deli Biwa and the Japanese Kimura competed for the final victory. After Kimura cleared 1.96 meters, the Philippines tried to advance further. They surprisingly cleared [a number was missing] meters, which was not far from the world record of 2.03 meters. The first and second place scores were both new meet records.</p>

<p>As soon as the gun fired, the Chinese and Filipino athletes took the lead in the first 800 meters. The Japanese athletes were calm and gradually increased their pace. As a result, the first four places were all Japanese. The first place Tsuda created a new record of four minutes and six seconds.</p>
<h3 id="e105">(11) 10,000 Meters <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The first place Ueto's time of 32 minutes and 42.6 seconds was a new meet record. Between 1,600 meters, Kudo was still in second or third position. The Chinese Sun Anting and Long Zexian were in fifth or sixth position. Later, they gradually distanced themselves and were still in excellent spirits when they ran to the finish line five laps away. The audience applauded to welcome them.</p>

<p>The first, second, third, and fourth places were all Japanese. The first three places, Sumiyoshi (62.19 meters), Ito (60.09 meters), and Kanno (58.40 meters), were new records. The sharp advance of Japan in this sport is astonishing. Our athletes were eliminated at 45 meters.</p>

<p>The scores of Japan and the Philippines were equal, and the situation of mutual pursuit was tense. Yoshioka won, touching the line first with one shoulder. Japan's long-cherished wish was finally realized. Second place went to the Filipino Chen Jagga. Yoshioka's time of 21 seconds created a new meet record.</p>

<p>The Philippines was most confident in this event. Initially, the Japanese Asakawa held the lead, but halfway through, the Filipinos stood out and occupied the top three positions. This was a triumphant achievement for the Filipinos, with a time of 25.6 seconds, which was not as good as the previous session.</p>

<p>The Japanese Hisatomi's time of one minute and 58.8 seconds also created one of the new records of this session. The Filipino Adeal had agile steps but insufficient endurance, ranking third. The Chinese athletes found it difficult to compete with them.</p>

<p>The 9th Far Eastern Games were held in Tokyo, Japan. The Japanese side not only made special efforts in various competitions, selecting strong teams in order to defeat China and the Philippines and dominate the Far East, but also strived for excellence in all aspects of layout, equipment, hospitality, and publicity. The construction of the venue was particularly costly, magnificent, and truly spectacular. It cannot be compared to the sports fields on Shanghai's Avenue Dubail and Hangzhou's Mei Dong Gaoqiao.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Track and Field Venue <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Far Eastern Games venue is located in Meiji Jingu Gaien, about ten miles from the center of Tokyo. It can be reached by car from Tokyo Station in about 20 minutes. The air near the venue is excellent, with wide roads and trees planted on both sides, lush green grass like a lawn, quiet and pleasant, quite similar to the area of Shanghai French Concession's Avenue Baille. The width of the road is almost double. Cars drive without dust and there is no worry of congestion. In addition, Japanese women in elegant clothes walk in groups, adding to the scenery and making it more interesting. At the end of the wide road is the Painting Hall, a magnificent building. Shortly after heading west, you can see the track and field venue in the shade of the trees. The scale of the venue is entirely based on the construction of the International Sports Stadium. The rostrum and spectator stands on one side are all made of cement. The national flags of the four countries are hung high on the rostrum and in the center of the venue. The press seats are on both sides of the board of directors' seats. The other half of the circle opposite the rostrum is a natural grandstand made of earth. It is extremely clear to see the actions of people in the field. The entire venue can accommodate about 50,000 people. The soccer field is located inside the track and field, and the track and field events do not conflict in time.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Basketball and Volleyball Venue <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>About a dozen steps south of the track and field venue is the basketball and volleyball venue. It was originally a Japanese open wrestling venue, which has been processed and transformed. The surrounding is a natural green grass grandstand. From a distance, it looks very much like a bowl-shaped stadium. The ball court is 80 feet long and 40 feet wide. The wooden boards are made of American pine. The basketball hoop legs have small wheels and can be moved freely. Open boxing matches are also held here. There are several vertical and horizontal wires and dozens of electric lights above it, illuminating the night like daytime. The entire venue can accommodate 15,000 people.</p>

<p>Adjacent to the basketball and volleyball venue is the baseball field. The Japanese are almost household names for baseball. The Japanese Six University Baseball Championship is held here. The venue is extremely wide and the grandstand can accommodate 70,000 to 80,000 people. It is conceivable how large the venue is.</p>
<h3 id="e114">New Swimming Pool <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>This time, the Japanese Swimming Competition Committee, in view of Japan's failure at the 8th Far Eastern Games, has made special efforts in the training of athletes. It is very confident in winning the championship. In order to promote swimming, it allocated US$250,000 to build a large swimming pool and a diving pool in the open space slightly north and behind the track and field venue. From April 20th, work was carried out day and night to rush construction. As of the time the reporter filed this report, it has not yet been completed. The construction of the large grandstand has only been completed by 60-70%. According to the people of the Japan Sports Association, the swimming competition should be completed before any event. In addition, the tennis court is not in one place, which is a pity. (Qian Hua, May 19)</p>
<h3 id="e115">Japanese Newspapers Boast About Basketball Victory <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Not a Word About Unfair Judging</p>
<p>Chinese Team Has a Spirit of Benevolence and Chivalry</p>
<p>This newspaper, Tokyo, 25th: This morning, Japanese newspapers, without exception, used eye-catching headlines to greatly boast about the Japanese basketball team's first victory over China last night. All credited the victory to the team members' careful and courageous fighting and outstanding offense and defense. Not a single word was mentioned about the unfairness of the referees. In fact, only four of the twelve fouls charged against our country could be justified. Our team members were in such a disadvantageous position that they almost lost the possibility of activity. The Japanese team's ball skills have indeed improved compared to previous years, but the referees' slightest partiality immediately changed the overall situation. Moreover, in the situation like yesterday, even if our country's coaches and players were determined to save the situation, it may not have been possible. However, yesterday, although our country lost, all the team members were able to maintain the spirit of sportsmen. When the Japanese were overjoyed with their first victory over us and sang the national anthem loudly, our team members still forgot the previous disappointment and stood up in unison to show respect to Japan. This kind of spirit left a deep impression on the audience at the time.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Sidelines of the Games (Qian Hua) <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Reporters rushed around. Japanese newspapers paid extraordinary attention to sports news and covered sports news in great detail. The Japanese Youth Hall became the target of everyone. Almost every moment, reporters from various newspapers could be seen doing their interviews separately, either interviewing the Philippine soccer team or talking to our baseball team. The first difficulty was the language barrier. Every word and every sentence required the assistance of a translator. The Japanese translator of the Youth Hall is now an ordinary shop assistant. His knowledge is extremely limited, and he often does not know what he is talking about at all. A reporter from a Kyushu newspaper went to the second floor to find our country's staff. Rong Qizhao received him. The reporter said that he wanted to talk to the baseball team representative about the situation of your country's baseball team. Rong said that if there were any questions, he could answer them on their behalf. Because the team came from the United States, they only spoke English and Cantonese. The translator only knew Shanghainese, which was quite difficult. (The reporter still insisted on seeing them, and after a long time, he could not get his way. Finally, he asked about the strength of the Chinese and Philippine baseball teams. Rong said that you can't know until you play. He also asked what the Chinese baseball team members thought of the Japanese baseball team's criticism of Miyata's skills. Rong replied that he had already learned about it in the university battle a few days ago. It was very good, very good. The interview ended.) Another day, a reporter from a newspaper asked about the brief history of our country's head representative, Zhang Boling. He was told that he was currently the president of Nankai University in Tianjin and was quite prestigious in the education field. The next morning, the newspaper prominently published that Zhang Boling had served as Minister of Education. There were all kinds of absurdities, all caused by the language barrier.</p>

<p>Ms. Sun Guiyun, the well-known track and field athlete, was also very popular in Japan. Various newspapers praised her extremely favorably, praising her as second only to Kinu. It can be seen that the Japanese admire heroes. Ms. Sun would return to her room on the second floor of the Youth Hall to rest after practicing in the field every morning. Someone brought a large, solitary Asahi Shimbun sports special issue, which contained detailed records of Japanese women's track and field achievements. This aroused the female earth's great attention and frequently asked about Kinu's 100 meters. She asked what her results were. She replied that among the ten best Japanese women runners, Kinu ranked first with a score of 12 seconds. The tenth place had a score of 13.4 seconds. Ms. Sun said after hearing this, "I know they run very fast." It contains quite a bit of sour grapes.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Iron Bed Load <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling, the head representative of our country, is of a towering and unusually tall stature, worthy of the northern athletes. Initially, he had intended to live in the Japanese Youth Hall, but later he felt that it was too noisy, so he moved to the Marunouchi Hotel. At that time, the hotel was already full, and only a small room in a corner on the fifth floor was left. The Secretary Zhang of the Youth Association accompanied him to the room. The furnishings in the room consisted only of a medium-sized iron bed and a table and two chairs. Secretary Zhang saw that the iron bed was not large and that Dr. Zhang's weight was also unusually heavy, so he was worried that it would not be able to bear the load. He quickly said, "This bed is too small, right?" Dr. Zhang said, "Although my body is big, it's not to that extent."</p>

<p>After the Chinese athletes arrived in Tokyo, they did not exchange Japanese currency in a hurry, and no shop in Tokyo accepted Chinese currency. As a result, the athletes all cried out in suffering, opening their eyes to the money but having nowhere to use it. It was truly a situation of "heroes having no place to display their talents." They jointly requested the representative to find a solution. Finally, a certain gentleman from the Yokohama Consulate personally went to Yokohama to change it. In total, he exchanged more than 4,000 Japanese yen.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Breaking the Budget <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The cost of living in Japan has soared in recent years, almost on par with Europe and the United States. Normally, it costs four Japanese angles to wash a suit shirt and one angle for socks. Each pair of cotton trousers costs one yuan. The Chinese athletes run around and practice every day, sweating like a slurry, and almost have to change their clothes every day. Basketball coach Dong Shouyi quickly calculated that it was not economically feasible. He hurriedly said to the basketball team members, "It's best if you can wash your small items yourselves, otherwise change them less often. If everyone goes to wash them at will, the laundry fee will cost 5,000 Japanese yen, which would break the budget." It can also be seen the cost of living in Japan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, in addition to the elementary school volleyball championship, there were also four elementary soccer and basketball games at the City One Public Sports Field. The results are recorded below. (1) Elementary Soccer Game. At 9:00 AM, the Young Children team vs. the Jiande team. The Young Children team used its ever-victorious capital to display its miraculous skills, defeating the enemy like crushing dry weeds. The score was ten to one. At 2:00 PM, the Kindergarten team vs. the Yongjian team. The children aged 11 to 12 did their best to kick and head the ball. It was indeed very difficult. After a bloody battle, the Kindergarten team won by a score of four to one. At 3:00 PM, the City B team vs. the Xianglin team. Both teams charged into battle with great courage. However, in terms of teamwork, Xianglin was ultimately lacking, so they lost by a score of three to one. (2) Basketball Game. The All Black team vs. the Nanguang team. The match started at 4:00 PM. The All Black team was stronger. Left forward Chen Weide shot accurately and scored twelve points, thus defeating Nanguang by a score of forty-five to twenty-two. The referee was Zhang Longhai.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the National Games, Chairman Dai Jitao, considering that the construction costs of the venue and dormitory were huge, and that it would be inappropriate to preserve them as a waste of money, proposed three measures for disposal. The proposal was approved by the government and sent to the Executive Yuan, which ordered the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Zhejiang Provincial Government to comply. The three measures are as follows: (1) The Zhejiang Provincial Government will bear half of the costs. (2) A barracks and playground of equal size to the current playground will be constructed. The expenses will be borne equally by the National Government and the Zhejiang Provincial Government. (2) The current sports field will be designated as the National Hangzhou Sports Field and handed over to the Education Department of the Zhejiang Provincial Government for management. (3) Before the establishment of the aforementioned construction, the current sports field will be temporarily allocated for military use. The sports construction on the ground will be the responsibility of the Zhejiang Provincial Education Department.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Jiangsu Education Department Orders to Organize <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Preliminary Education and Expenditure Distribution Standards in Various Counties</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Education Department instructed the directors of education bureaus in various counties, saying that in order to comply with the matter, the development of local education depends entirely on whether the educational funds and the facilities are balanced. To spend wastefully with funds and to be extravagant without funds, both are enough to lead to the bankruptcy of local education. Whenever the semester ends in each county, elementary school principals or city medical personnel often disregard whether the educational funds are sufficient, requesting to add levels and establish schools, or asking people to intercede, or gathering crowds to surround, or arbitrarily adding levels and establishing schools. In the middle of the semester, they forcibly request the Education Bureau to bear the expenses or arbitrarily increase the salaries of teachers and school expenses. There are even other public officials who force the establishment of schools in order to introduce private individuals. There are also those who falsely claim that the expenses can be raised by themselves in order to seek private gain under the guise of public interest. If the responsible bureau delays slightly, they will say that it is destroying education, and if they are not recognized, they will recklessly attack. Counting the matters of each county where the increase in education expenditure has led to bankruptcy, and the director has suffered hardship because he has performed his duties and abided by the law, the ultimate cause is that this kind of out-of-track action is the root of the problem. Now the eighteenth year is coming to an end, and the nineteenth year is about to begin. All the counties should follow the outline of the educational budget that has been ordered to follow and formulate the education budget for the nineteenth year. All counties where the existing educational undertakings exceed the annual budget income should follow the outline and earnestly reduce or merge them. From now on, the addition of levels and the establishment of schools in each county should be supervised by the county magistrate and the director of the education bureau according to the results of the administrative meters and the consideration of the balance of funds and undertakings. They should properly formulate plans and submit them to the Education Department for review and decision. As for the distribution of school funds, compulsory education should be the main body. Before the junior high schools and the higher grades of elementary schools have made other special funds, no expansion is allowed. The annual fee for each grade in the higher grades of elementary schools should be between 500 yuan and 700 yuan, and the number of teachers should be one and a half. The annual fee for each grade in the junior grades and the junior elementary schools should be between 200 yuan and 350 yuan, and the number of teachers should be one. Each county should formulate distribution standards in detail according to the above-mentioned limits, but still according to the original standards and economic capacity of the county, and submit them together with the budget book for examination. Those whose original standards are less than the above-mentioned minimum limits shall not be allowed to increase without authorization before special funds are approved. The tuition fees collected by all schools should be handed over to the bureau for official use and included in the budget income. The number of students should be 50. For those who exceed or fall short, the regular expenses should be increased or decreased. If the classrooms are small, a two-part teaching system should be implemented. If there are not enough 30 people, classes are not allowed to be opened. Of the fees added for each grade in the junior section due to the number of people exceeding the quota, 80% shall be the labor performance salary of the head teacher of each grade, and 20% shall be miscellaneous expenses. The principal shall not use the excuse of the contract to move it privately. If assistant teachers need to be hired in each grade, the recommendation of the head teacher of each grade must be obtained, and the permission of the principal or the person in charge and the education committee or the principal of the central elementary school must be obtained, and the principal shall appoint him. The salary shall be paid from the labor performance salary that the head teacher should receive, and no other public funds shall be paid. The decision on the number of people in each grade each semester shall be based on the average number of attendances during the inspection by administrative personnel more than once. However, if there are indeed children with grades in the school that can prove that there are actually people there, they can also be recognized. Before the number of grades in each school is decided at the beginning of the school year, the public expenses paid by each school each month shall be provisionally supported and then settled clearly after the decision is made. Official expenses must be used to the fullest extent possible, and people must be used to the fullest extent possible, so that the effect of the school can be maximized. At the same time, the individual's gains shall be slightly surplus, and the total amount of public expenditure shall not be drastically increased, so that administrative progress can be gradually expected. All the above-mentioned items shall be strictly enforced by the county magistrate together with the director of the education bureau, and there shall be no favoritism. The education expenditure budget for the nineteenth year of each county shall be prepared and submitted for review before the end of June of this year. In particular, the expenditure of universal education funds must be carried out in strict compliance with the law. If there is any violation of the above instructions, only the director of the education bureau of each county shall be questioned. In addition to the order, you should immediately follow and announce it to the public. This order is of utmost importance.</p>

<p>The Training Department of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters considers the promotion of Party Doctrine education during the Tutelage Period to be of utmost importance. Therefore, it is customary to conduct a Party Education inspection once every semester to assess achievements and make improvements accordingly. The department's Party Doctrine Education Section has decided during its Third Section Affairs Meeting that the third inspection will commence from June 1st for middle schools and from June 5th for primary schools, concluding approximately one month later. This inspection of middle schools will be handled by the Party Doctrine Education Section of the department. All other more than five hundred public and private primary schools will be assigned to districts for inspection based on location. The fourth grade of primary schools must undergo testing to observe their actual level of understanding. It is reported that all inspection forms and documents have been distributed to the respective districts. The district training committees will organize Party Education inspection committees to prepare everything. All schools within the city should also prepare early. Schools that received supervision, urging, or warnings during the second inspection last year should pay particular attention in advance, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Foreign Minister Wang Temporarily Will Not Return to Beijing <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Fan Guangzhi's Statement</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that Fan Guangzhi, a counselor of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who brought a letter from President Tan and others urging Foreign Minister Wang to return to Beijing, was previously reported. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guomin News Agency interviewed Mr. Fan and inquired about when Foreign Minister Wang would return to Beijing to cancel his leave. He replied as follows: Minister Wang has felt quite fatigued after working hard to recover Vladivostok and sign the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement and other important cases, so he wanted to take some time to rest. He previously requested a two-week leave from President Tan for recuperation. However, President Tan and other central figures believed that foreign affairs were important and could not be without someone in charge for a day, so they all advised him to return to Beijing to handle matters as soon as possible. Chairman Chiang also telegraphed Minister Wang, urging him to return to Beijing. Minister Wang originally intended to return to Beijing with the spirit of dedicating himself to the country, but according to doctors, Minister Wang's intestinal illness is quite severe, and his stomach often feels acidic and vomits due to parasites in his intestines. He must receive ten days of treatment before he can recover. Therefore, Minister Wang has no choice but to continue his leave and cannot return to Beijing temporarily. The reporter further inquired about the recent progress of foreign affairs. According to the reply, since American Minister Johnson came to Shanghai, there has been progress in discussing the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction. The embassies of Norway, Cuba, Finland, Czechoslovakia, and Turkey in Peiping have all moved south. The Japanese embassy has also moved its seals and important documents. The German embassy will also move after finding suitable housing in Beijing and Shanghai. The reactionary warlords in the north wanted to bewilder the foreign envoys in order to achieve their conspiracy to restrain the central government, but now they have nothing to rely on. The reporter asked Mr. Fan when he would return to Beijing. Fan said that he must return to Beijing tonight to report to President Tan, President Hu, and others.</p>

<p>The Banking Community Has Agreed to Underwrite</p>
<p>Nanjing Special City Mayor Wei Daoming issued 3 million yuan of municipal public bonds for the sake of municipal construction. Since the issuance of these bonds, only 500,000 to 600,000 yuan have been sold, with a large surplus. Recently, the city's construction of a water supply project requires a large amount of funds, so Mr. Wei came to Shanghai a few days ago to negotiate with the local banking community for underwriting. It is reported that as a result of Mayor Wei's negotiations in Shanghai, the banking community, although feeling that the capital city's finances are difficult, can still deposit public bond funds on schedule, which is trustworthy, and has agreed to sell the bonds.</p>

<p>For Reference by the Mawei Naval Academy</p>
<p>According to sources from the local navy, the naval students from various provinces who were recruited in Beijing by the Ministry of the Navy have already started classes at the Mawei Naval Academy in Fujian Province. The ministry believes that the students should have a considerable understanding of the structure of warships. In naval academies of various countries, there is a model of a warship in the school to serve as a reference and facilitate teaching. Vice Minister Chen Shaokuan is striving to improve the facilities of the naval academy, so he pays great attention to the arrangement of models. He specially allocated a silver warship model and a hawksbill turtle torpedo model, which were kept by the Naval Survey Bureau, to the school for display. The model is very well equipped and exquisitely carved, which can be used for educational research. Yesterday, he ordered the Naval Survey Bureau to allocate the model to the school for application.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Municipal Party Headquarters to Establish a Trade Union Secretary Training Institute <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Mass Training Committee of the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters, in view of the importance of trade union secretary training, plans to open a trade union secretary training institute next month. The plan and its budget have been approved by the Municipal Executive Committee and Comrade Pan Gongzhan has been appointed as the director of the training institute. The original text of the plan is copied below: (1) Origin: The labor movement in this city has always been developed. The number of trade unions registered with Party and government agencies has reached more than 300. However, their quality still cannot fully meet our ideals. The majority of trade union members still need the Party's expedited training. The Civic Training Association believes that although there are many ways to train, the trade union secretary who guides and delves into the grassroots level to share the responsibility of leading the masses will surely achieve great results. However, at present, there are still few trade union secretaries with excellent talents and hardworking work. Most of the secretaries, those above can only draft documents and manage records; those in the middle waste association funds sitting idly; those below either flatter the capitalists and contribute to the workers, or collude with bandits and instigate unrest. The harm is incalculable. The Civic Training Association is angry and worried about it, so the Trade Union Secretary Training Institute was established, and the Trade Union Secretary Training Committee is in charge of its affairs. Within a year and a half, several sound secretaries will be created and sent to various trade unions to take office. (2) Training Objectives: This institute focuses on political education, health education, livelihood education, leisure education, language and writing education, and social interaction education for trade union secretaries. The graduates should possess the following conditions in the future: (1) Understand and believe in the Three Principles of the People; (2) Understand ordinary social sciences; (3) Understand the international situation and the oppression imposed on us by the great powers; (4) Understand the various laws and regulations related to the labor movement and have a rudimentary knowledge of law; (5) Develop the ability to use the four powers; (6) Be able to serve as a coach for the Boy Scouts; (7) Have knowledge and skills in common first aid; (8) Be able to organize various cooperatives; (9) Be able to play games such as football, basketball, and tennis; (10) Be able to speak in public and preside over meetings; (11) Be able to write articles and draw pictures; (12) Have the spirit of serving the community; (13) Have the willingness and habit of approaching workers; (14) Have the ability to educate workers. (3) Organization: The organization of this institute is as follows: (A) Director: Manages school affairs; (B) Director of Academic Affairs: 1. Formulate curriculum; 2. Adjust academic status; 3. Find teachers; 4. Internship guidance; 5. Examine students' grades; (C) Director of Training: 1. Manage students' daily life; 2. Guide students' extracurricular assignments; 3. Cultivate students' spirit and personality; 4. Handle students' attendance and absence; 5. Manage students' rewards and punishments; (D) Director of General Affairs: 1. Manage finances; 2. Handle food and lodging; 3. Draft documents; 4. Keep books; 5. Daily general affairs. (4) Funding: This institute plans to recruit 50 students and provide them with six months of training. The institute will provide food, lodging, books, and clothing, which will cost approximately 1,200 yuan per month, totaling 7,200 yuan in six months. The budget is attached separately. (5) Curriculum: The institute will have eight hours of classes every day. From 8:00 to 9:00 AM is morning exercise, and from 4:00 to 5:00 PM is recreational exercise.

<h3 id="e141">Overseas Chinese Merchants Hope for Domestic Manufacturers <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Names, Addresses, and Product Samples</p>
<p>Registered Trademarks Assembled into a Booklet</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation yesterday received a letter from the Commercial Integration Association stating that it had received a letter from the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce stating that it had previously received a letter from the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation stating that the federation had recently greatly organized and cooperated to seek high-quality goods to resist foreign goods and planned to come to Nanyang to find a site to open a national products mobile exhibition, so that overseas Chinese compatriots could recognize national products and directly purchase them. Our association, in order to plan properly, has replied to the federation that it needs to send competent personnel to Nanyang in advance to assess the situation and contact everything in order to ensure that the handling is as good as possible in the future. It is now found that the news is published in Shen Bao, and it is learned that the Shanghai National Products Factory Federation has resolved to send personnel to Singapore to discuss seeking a grand scale and planning to be foolproof. The letter informs each factory to actively proceed. Our association believes that my country's recent gold price has soared. If national products are not vigorously promoted overseas to recover rights and interests, then the panic in the economic community will have no other good way to provide relief. Our association believes that at this time, when merchants and groups at home and abroad are working together to plan the development of national products, the factories in Shanghai should prepare their names, addresses, and product samples as soon as possible, and register trademarks to be assembled into a booklet. When the national products mobile exhibition comes to Nanyang to persuade merchants to eliminate them, Chinese merchants can easily have a chapter in hand to understand as if they know the back of their hand, which will greatly benefit the future of national products sales. I hope to get one idea. Accordingly, I am writing to your association to quickly inform the factories of your association to speed up the above-mentioned matters to promote national products.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Dredging the Songjiang River, Donating and Reducing Rice Taxes <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Municipal and County Rice Association Meeting Proposals</p>
<p>The Jiangsu, Nanjing, Shanghai, Municipal and County Rice Industry Federation held its eighth joint meeting of directors and supervisors at Cuixiu Hall yesterday afternoon. The members present were Zhu Zixiang, Chen Junyu, and others, totaling seventeen people. Chen Junyu was elected chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported that the Social Affairs Bureau had instructed the Shanghai North Rice Federation to levy donations for dredging the Songjiang River. The resolution was that the donations levied by the Shanghai North Rice Federation were not used for dredging the Songjiang River and should be refused. As for the Social Affairs Bureau's order to levy dredging donations, a request should be submitted again to announce the amount of funding needed for dredging the Songjiang River, convene meetings of various industries to discuss how much the rice industry should contribute, and how much each industry should be responsible for before a formal commitment can be made. Then, it was proposed that the provincial government plans to reduce or exempt rice taxes in Jiangsu Province for three months to maintain the people's food supply. The Ministry of Finance has allowed it, but the tax offices still levy donations and have not implemented it. The resolution was that the association should submit a request to the provincial government again to request the Ministry of Finance to order its implementation. Zhao Zixin proposed a proposal to reduce or exempt rice and grain taxes. The resolution was that the content of the proposal was roughly the same as the chairman's proposal and should be handled together. Then, the association discussed the implementation plan, and the meeting was adjourned when the clock struck five.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Petition from the Municipal Training Committee Requesting the Central Government to Promptly Order the Resumption of Operations by Nanyang Tobacco Factory <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Public Training Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department, considering that the abrupt closure of the Nanyang Tobacco Company in this city last year and its failure to resume operations in accordance with the handling methods of Party and government organs, resulting in the sudden unemployment and hardship of thousands of workers at the factory, yesterday specially submitted a petition to the Central Training Department, stating that (the above is omitted) the case was approved by the Secretariat of our Party Department and forwarded to your department's letter No. 8758, hoping that the shutdown dispute of the Nanyang Tobacco Factory would be investigated and a solution would be jointly drafted by the municipal government and submitted to the department for approval. It is hereby ordered to handle it. It has been secretly investigated that the association has previously received a report from Liang Kunli and others, representatives of the unemployed workers of the Nanyang Tobacco Factory, stating that the factory suddenly closed down the Shanghai factory, and all the workers were suddenly unemployed and had difficulty making a living, requesting a quick order to open the factory. It should be a labor-capital dispute, and the Bureau of Social Affairs has been requested to find a way to mediate it quickly. It was then replied that the representatives had come to the meeting one after another to request relief, and then proposed the ninth meeting of the previous association. Since the reorganization of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company in the eighth year of the Republic of China, it has earned 3 to 4 million yuan in the five years from the eighth to the twelfth year of the Republic of China, and 2 to 3 million yuan in the four years from the 13th to the 16th year of the Republic of China. Although it lost a total of 4 million yuan in the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, it is no less than a drop in the bucket for the company, and there are more than 3,000 employees in the factory. Once unemployed, they will feel difficult to make a living, which will hinder social public security. According to the investigation report, the company did not report to the Party and government organs before closing the Shanghai factory, which is a clear violation of Articles 6 and 7 of the Interim Measures for Retirement Benefits of Employees in this city. The resolutions were: (1) The association believes that the Nanyang Tobacco incident is a problem of suspension of business rather than cessation of business. (2) The Bureau of Social Affairs determines the period of suspension of business based on the actual situation. (3) During the suspension period, the factory should pay workers' living expenses. (4) The money that the factory has paid should be regarded as workers' living expenses and should not be regarded as retirement money. (5) Please order the factory to issue the unpaid maintenance</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>Fee to all workers in accordance with the rules. (6) The above methods should be notified to the workers' delegation. The six handling methods were immediately sent to the Bureau of Social Affairs for quick handling in order to eliminate disputes and prevent future troubles. Later, the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Association repeatedly mediated, but the factory had no sincerity in mediation, so the mediation was terminated. Later, the Bureau of Social Affairs forwarded an order from the Municipal Government to inquire whether the previous resolutions of the Association were based on the workers' requests. The handling methods were based on the workers' requests and the results of the Association's investigation, and should be resolved by the government organs as soon as possible. As for the factory's claim that the case has come to an end and the dispute has subsided, there is no need for the Association to set another handling method, etc., which is not true. Before it is decided whether the business is allowed to cease or suspend, the dispute has not subsided. Moreover, the Interim Measures for Retirement Benefits of Employees in this city have clear regulations on the methods for employers to dismiss employees due to cessation or suspension of business. In order to maintain the authority of the law, the case cannot be said to have subsided because most of the workers have voluntarily received subsidies. It has been repeatedly sent to the Bureau to investigate the previous cause and handle it quickly in order to reach a conclusion as soon as possible. On April 4, Liang Kunli and others, representatives of the factory workers, reported that the factory owner had entrusted other tobacco factories to roll cigarettes as usual, requesting that the factory be ordered to quickly open the factory and resume work in order to maintain their livelihood. A special staff was sent to consult with the Bureau of Social Affairs to determine the methods as follows: (1) Order the factory to submit the factory rules, employment contract, and resumption plan to the Bureau for approval before the end of April. (2) Limit the factory to open the factory and resume work before May 16. (3) If long-term workers who are laid off by the factory after resumption of work have served for two years, they must be paid retirement money of two months per person. (4) If the factory does not resume work by May 16, the factory should pay one-twelfth of the monthly salary as maintenance fee during the extended period. The disputes have been delayed and unresolved after the factory closed down, which is not the right way. The factory owner believes that the business is bleak and it is difficult to fulfill the previously agreed contract. It is true that the workers have been unemployed for three months and their lives are difficult. Therefore, the methods are determined as above and have been ordered by the Bureau to be followed by both parties on record. This is the situation of the association and the Bureau of Social Affairs handling the case. The intention of the association was originally to hope that the factory would follow the rules so that the workers' lives could be maintained, the factory's business could be restored, and the disputes could be resolved from then on. However, the company did not appreciate the hard work of the local authorities in maintaining the industry and protecting the workers, and delayed in complying with it and used excuses to seek to withdraw the order. It is planned to send another letter to the Bureau of Social Affairs to discuss the handling methods. However, after reading the report on the 12th of this month, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's letter No. 1007 to the Municipal Government contained mostly biased words on the side of the company, and said that third parties could not interfere, etc. It is not known that the local authorities in this city repeatedly ordered the factory to plan to resume work because they did not want the declining industry to be further hit and affect the national economy and people's livelihood. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce does not know the facts of the case and ignores the interim regulations of this city, and makes an affirmative statement based on what the company said. It is considered that it should be corrected. In short, the company's suspension of the Shanghai factory is not reasonable in terms of sentiment and reason. If the resumption of work is feasible, it is only because a few principals are ignorant of the facts and unwilling to open the factory. Therefore, in order to plan the industry of our country and protect the welfare of workers, please ask your department to forward the National Government to order the company to follow the methods determined by the Bureau of Social Affairs of this city to resume work as soon as possible, so as to maintain the political order and eliminate disputes. In order to facilitate the Party, it is hereby presented to the Training Department of the Central Executive Committee.</p>
<h3 id="e144">The Shanghai General Labor Union Opposes the Establishment of a Labor-Capital Mediation Department in the Concession <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Special Municipal General Labor Union yesterday issued a declaration opposing the proposal of the concession authorities to establish a labor-capital mediation department. (The above is omitted) The concession authorities had a motion to establish a labor-capital mediation department last year, which was not realized after the strong opposition of the Chinese people. Now it is heard that there is a resurgence of the past, in order to fulfill their idealistic ambitions. The National Government has long had laws and regulations on labor-capital disputes, stipulating that they should be handled by our local administrative offices in accordance with the law, but the imperialists have come up with a whimsical idea to set up a labor-capital mediation department in the concession area of our country. It can be seen that their intention is nothing more than to use this as an excuse to oppress our workers and profit from it. All kinds of incredible absurdities are plundering the right to govern and satisfying their ambitions and aggressive desires. If this kind of treacherous conspiracy to humiliate the country and overstep the authority is not exposed early, the suffering of the labor movement in our country from imperialism will be even more unbearable in the future. I hope that our compatriots from all walks of life will rise up to make a strong opposition to protect national rights and maintain the labor movement. This is the declaration.</p>

<p>The end of May this year has long been announced by the Chamber of Commerce as the date for the first account settlement season. It was heard yesterday that the silk and satin industry groups have all implemented this and started sending out lists yesterday. Details were previously recorded in this newspaper. It was heard yesterday that the coal industry and charcoal shops in Shanghai have also issued notices to all customers who settle accounts three times a year, requiring them to settle accounts by the end of May. They have started sending out account statements yesterday and notified all colleagues to follow suit. The notice said: Regarding the notice, the end of May this year is the first account settlement season for the business community. We hereby specially notify all factories, firms, users, and colleagues in this city and other places to settle accounts on schedule to be consistent. This is of utmost importance. This is to inform the Shanghai Special Municipal Coal Industry Association. The Charcoal Industry Association also has the same notice, with similar wording, which is omitted. It was also heard that rice shops, medicinal material shops, foreign general merchandise shops, and paper shops, and all shops selling daily consumer goods have been sending out accounts one after another since yesterday. However, it is seen that a small number of account statements still have the words (Dragon Boat Festival) printed on them, which is very inappropriate.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Declaration of the Pharmacist Support Association <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Expressing Dissatisfaction with the Capitalists</p>
<p>The Pharmacist Support Association issued a declaration yesterday, saying: Compatriots from all walks of life, workers across the country, the pharmaceutical industry in Shanghai has unfortunately caused a huge storm for the problem of placing unemployed workers. The news disclosed in the newspapers for several months, I think everyone has seen it clearly. However, the self-respecting and arrogant capitalists, his cunning means can be said to have unexpected magic. After the pharmaceutical industry workers requested the placement of unemployed workers, the superior authorities in this city used extremely fair methods to solve the problem, according to the number of surplus of each store last year to place the number of unemployed workers. This method can be said to be the most fair and just. However, the capitalists refused to accept it, and even exaggerated their words and went to the Central Government to petition. Later, the Central Government still ordered the capitalists to place more than 64 workers. The workers obeyed the orders of the Party and the country and all resumed work. How could they have expected that the capitalists would still regard the orders of the Central Government as worthless and still refuse to accept them? Now they have further sent representatives to the Central Government to petition again through the Chamber of Commerce. How grand is the momentum? In short, the pharmaceutical industry capitalists have money and power. What is called the superior and what is called the Central Government? They can refuse everything that cannot fulfill their desires. The ultimate goal is to make the superior authorities and the Central Government of this city to comply with their requests, then they will be happy. Compatriots, workers, this phenomenon may only exist in Shanghai. We, the 800,000 workers who share the same boat, must know that the pharmaceutical industry capitalists are the envoys who destroy the labor movement and are the enemies of the workers in the whole city. Now we should take out the final strength to deal with this demon, then it is the original appearance of the revolutionary people. This is the declaration, and I hope you will appreciate it.</p>

It was recommended that Tan Yigong and Yu Zhongluo first order more beautiful style uniforms from clothing stores, and then notify the members to make uniforms in the same style.

<p>The matter of changing the Shanghai County Public Security Bureau from a bureau to a section was discussed by the former County Chief Leng and submitted to the Jiangsu Department of Civil Affairs for approval.

<h3 id="e151">Collective Discussion of Vegetable Open-Air Weighing Industry <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Rongsheng, Qu Jiasheng, Zhu Daozhong, and more than 20 other members of the open-air weighing industry in Shanghai City recently believed that since the opening of trade between China and foreign countries in Shanghai, the concession has gradually expanded and the population has become more and more dense. Therefore, it is almost impossible to find a planting place in the vicinity. It depends on the vendors of vegetables from the nearby villages to meet the market. As a result, the market prices are not consistent and the weights are not the same. Therefore, there are often disputes and disputes that have become a habit. We, the open-air weighing industry, have repeatedly discussed the convenience of landowners and vendors. The only way is to organize a joint office of the same industry so that the buying and selling of vegetables in the market has a certain market price and a certain weight, so that the fraudulent and deceptive people can know themselves and restrain themselves from doing wrong. If there is heavy rain or drought and the source is scarce, the same industry will raise funds to purchase from the producing area at a parity price so that there is no shortage in the market, which is truly a win-win situation. It is heard that it has been decided to set up a joint office of the vegetable industry at No. 29 Ruifu Lane, French Concession, in a suitable location, and to carefully draft the regulations for temporary trial operation. Once it is successfully operated, it will be submitted to the official for filing.</p>

<p>Pirate Ship Failed to Catch Up</p>
<p>One Passenger Injured</p>
<p>The Shanghai Zhengchang Inland River Steamer Bureau, located on the south bank of Bentang Lane Bridge on the North Suzhou River in this city, has a total of three small steamers operating on the Shenhu route: River Ching, River Xing, and Juxing. On the afternoon of the 24th of this month, at 2:00 PM, the River Ching steamer towed four company ships and passenger and cargo ships from the lake to Shanghai. When it reached the Luoxu Tangkou, it was about 9:00 PM on the same evening. Suddenly, it encountered more than 40 pirate ships. The pirates on sentry duty mistakenly thought that the steamer was towing stone ships. When they saw that the towed ships were full of passengers, they realized that it was the Shenhu route steamer. They immediately ordered the steamer to stop, but the River Ching steamer had already sailed dozens of feet away from the pirate ship. The captain of the steamer knew that it was a pirate ship and ignored it. The pirates immediately opened fire with volley guns. The steamer sped forward to escape. The pirate ship followed and opened fire with volley guns. Fortunately, the steamer sped like lightning and the pirates failed to catch up, so they turned back. In this battle, the bandits fired about 50 shots, causing more than 10 gun holes in the last two boards of the Shen Yunquan passenger and cargo ship. A passenger selling mustard greens, Xiao Asan, was shot in the left leg, but the bullet did not penetrate. The steamer sailed to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to the information reported by the company manager, Xiao Asan, who was injured at the time, was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.</p>

<p>Tang felt very strange that these people took care of the poor scholars and could have ignored them, but he was afraid that something unexpected would happen, so he presented the letters to the Harbin Police Station for investigation. The temporary head of the team sent Detective Zhu Hanbo, detectives Sun Shaokun, Wu Deyu, Zhao Lianbi, etc. to the agreed location to</p>

<p>Dao Xian pedestrians on the horizon, the starlight is difficult to illuminate the shadow of the person in the dark, so this person reached into the container and groped for a moment, got a paper package, thought the purpose had been reached, put it in his arms and strode away. The detective hiding in the bushes and so on saw this action in his eyes. A shout came from all sides</p>

<p>There is also Zhou Dingwen from Ningbo who opened the Zhou Dingji Paint Shop at No. 419 Gansu Road. His craft is his livelihood. He originally had no strong financial resources, but the scaremongers only care about scaring and cheating, regardless of whether the person being cheated has the qualifications to be cheated.

<p>As a negotiation location, Zhou immediately reported to the Hui Company Police Station and sent Detective Wang Debiao and Detective Wu Shoushan to the address, but they did not encounter anything. The last letter agreed to a teahouse at Fangban Bridge in Ximen. When the detectives rushed to wait for a long time, there was no impact until the 23rd of this month. The detectives learned that the scaremongers were hiding in Xujiahui</p>

<p>They immediately joined forces with the detectives from the French Concession Police Station to arrest Wang Mingfu, a fellow villager of Zhou, and according to Wang's confession, Wang Desheng, who was hiding at No. 16 Xinmin Road, Zhabei, was an accomplice. The detectives all voted to the Zhabei Public Security Bureau and applied for additional detectives to secretly arrest him. Wang Desheng happened to be out, so he was not caught. The detectives returned to the city and met</p>

<p>Passengers and driver, a total of four people</p>
<p>Twenty packages of smoking paraphernalia in a suitcase</p>
<p>Each offender is separately detained and fined</p>
<p>The blue car is sentenced to be confiscated</p>
<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, around 10:00 AM, patrol officers from the Dachang Branch of the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau were patrolling on the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance highway when they noticed a blue car carrying four people, including passengers and a driver, speeding north. Finding their behavior suspicious, the officers immediately ordered the car to stop and conducted a search. They discovered twenty packages of opium of varying sizes in a suitcase inside the car. The police then impounded the car, along with the people and the evidence, and took them to the bureau. After questioning by the bureau chief, the suspects identified themselves as: Ma Yiru, 34 years old, from Shandong, residing on a boat in Liuhe, formerly a navigator in the anti-smuggling camp, currently unemployed; Li Jiren, 38 years old, from Shandong, residing in Shanghai's Xiaodongmen, running a cigarette paper shop; Zhang Tielin, 30 years old, from Shanghai, working as an accountant at the Futai Automobile Company on Minquan Road; and Zan Peigen, 31 years old, from Changzhou, working as a driver at the Fuda Automobile Company. The bureau, considering the case related to the transportation and sale of opium, immediately prepared a document and sent it to the County Public Security Bureau for transfer to the Baoshan County Government. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, County Magistrate Wu dispatched Judge Zhang Wei to hold a hearing. Ma Yiru testified that at 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, he and Li Jiren went to the Futai Automobile Company at No. 21 Minquan Road, which was owned by their friend Wu Quangui, and borrowed a car for their own use to drive back to Liuhe. He was carrying a handbag entrusted to him by his friend Lin He, and he did not know that the suitcase contained opium until the police inspection at Dachang revealed the two large and small packages of opium. He did not know the weight. After being taken to the bureau, the Li went with him to Liuhe. The Zhang and Cao were the car company's accountant and driver, respectively, and their remaining statements were evasive. Li Jiren testified that he and Ma were friends. At 9:00 AM this morning, he went to the Futai Automobile Company and called for a car at a price of eleven yuan. He followed Ma to Liuhe to burn incense. A friend named Lin Ming asked them to take a box to Liuhe, and he did not know what was in it. Lin Ming told him to go burn incense. This was his first time, and he had not been there before, and so on. Zhang Shulin testified that he worked as a night accountant at the Futai Automobile Company. He and the driver Cao Peigen went to play. He knew Ma and Li. The car belonged to the owner of the company, Wu Quangui, and was Wu's private car. Cao Peigen testified that they called for a car at 9:00 AM today. He was sleeping upstairs and was not the one who negotiated the price, but rather the accountant Xu. He did not know about the opium, and the box did not smell of opium. He could not ask the guests to open the box for inspection, and so on. After reviewing the statements, Judge Zhang sentenced Ma Yiru to one year and six months in prison with a two-year reprieve and a fine of 1,500 yuan for the crime of intending to sell and transport opium. Li Jiren was sentenced to the same crime with one year and six months in prison with a two-year reprieve and a fine of 1,000 yuan. Zhang Shulin was sentenced to the same crime with one year and six months in prison with a two-year reprieve and a fine of 150 yuan. Cao Peigen was sentenced to the same crime with one year and six months in prison and a fine of 80 yuan. The car was confiscated.</p>

<p>The bridal sedan overturns, the bride is injured</p>
<p>Carriers exhaust themselves propping up the sedan with wood</p>
<p>Rickshaw pullers gather to watch the spectacle</p>
<p>Forgetting themselves, they knock over the sedan</p>
<p>The other day, the Zhang family held a wedding celebration at the Hongqing Restaurant, specializing in Anhui cuisine, in the Wangjia Wharf area of the South City. They had a grand banquet, and the restaurant was filled with guests, creating quite a lively scene. Around 3:00 PM, the groom's family sent a bridal sedan to the bride's home to pick her up. Around 5:00 PM, after the bride entered the sedan, the procession began. As they passed the Dongjiadu area, the sedan carriers, their legs tired, used wooden supports to temporarily prop up the bridal sedan in front and back to rest. While the crowd on the side of the road was jostling to see the bride, two men from Dongtai, Tao Hongfeng and Xie Pidang, both pulling rickshaws, passed by. Looking up to watch, they forgot about the rickshaws they were pulling and accidentally caused the wheels of their rickshaws to hit the wooden supports of the bridal sedan. As a result, the wooden supports were knocked away, and the bridal sedan overturned on the ground. The bride fell out of the sedan, injuring her head, arms, and other areas, bleeding profusely. The bride was in so much pain that she lay on the ground, crying out in distress. People helped her up, and she was taken to the hospital by car for treatment. A police officer on duty at the Tenth Post there, Liu Yongsheng, arrested the two rickshaw pullers, Tao and Xie, and took them to the First Sub-station of the First District. After a preliminary hearing by the director of the station, they were ordered to be temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>

<p>County Public Education Center Organizes Fly-Swatting Competition</p>
<p>Public viewing scheduled for June 15th</p>
<p>In view of the increasingly hot weather and the fact that flies are a medium for spreading infectious diseases, the Shanghai County Public Education Center, recognizing that they must be eliminated as soon as possible to prevent harm, has established regulations and organized a fly-swatting competition. Starting today, notices have been sent to district offices and rural schools, and promotional advertisements have been posted to encourage people in each district to work hard to swat flies. The collection and public viewing will be held on June 15th, and a silver shield will be awarded to the person who swats the most flies. The second and third place winners will also receive considerable prizes. It is hoped that this initiative will eliminate fly infestations to a considerable extent. The guidelines for participating in the competition are as follows: (1) The center will hold a summer hygiene lecture on June 15th and will hold the fly-swatting competition on the same day. (2) Eliminating flies is an important task for summer epidemic prevention. To promote this effort, the center is launching a fly-swatting competition, inviting enthusiastic people from all walks of life to actively catch flies and bring them to the center for public viewing on June 15th. A silver shield will be awarded to the group or individual who catches the most flies, and the second and third place winners will also receive considerable prizes. (3) Public and private groups, agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors, and private individuals in the six districts of the county are eligible to participate. All captured flies must be sealed in tin cans, wrapped in thick paper, and sealed with adhesive, with the name of the fly catcher or group written on the outside. If not personally delivered, the mailing address must be noted. (4) The results of the fly-swatting competition will be judged by weight, with the highest weight being the first choice. (5) When catching flies, pay attention to the cleanliness of the fly swatter. Use pliers to remove dead flies attached to the swatter and place them in a fixed container. Do not catch flies by hand, and wash your hands each time to avoid infection. The fly swatter should also be rinsed with boiling water from time to time.</p>

<p>The old kidnapper's eyes fill with tears during the retrial of a major kidnapping suspect</p>
<p>Lu Peizhou was not involved in the plot</p>
<p>Zhang Hongxiang had a revelation of conscience</p>
<p>Lu Peizhou, a major suspect in the kidnapping case of wealthy merchants Yan Ruling, Lu Chengyan, and Qian Changgan, was previously arrested by the French police, interrogated by the French court, sentenced to five years in prison in the Western Prison, and deported to the inland court for trial. Because Lu was dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment, he hired a lawyer, Pu Laimei, to file an appeal, stating the reasons and requesting a retrial. With the approval of the Chinese and Western officials, the case was submitted for retrial the day before yesterday. The lawyer representing the appellant stated that the appellant's confession in the police station was untrue. The so-called Zhang A Si and the client colluded to kidnap his brother Lu Chengxiao and divide the money. There was no such person as Zhang A Si from beginning to end, and his brother Lu Chengxiao did not file a lawsuit with your court. This is the first untruth. Also, in the kidnapping case of Yan Ruling, although the principal offender Lu Hongxiang was acquainted with him, he was not present at the time of the kidnapping. This is the second untruth. As for the confession form of the police station, it was actually written by the people in the police station and then the defendant was ordered to sign it, and it was not the defendant's own handwriting. There is no evidence to support the allegations, and the defendant should be released. At this point, the official ordered the principal offender Lu Hongxiang to be brought to the court for interrogation. Zhang confessed that the kidnapping of Yan Ruling was actually initiated by Zhang Zhuying, who was at large, who told the people that the Yan family was quite wealthy. If a ransom of 100,000 yuan could be obtained, each would get 50,000 yuan. Therefore, the people invited others to kidnap him. As for Lu Peizhou, the people had met him once at his brother Lu Chongpeng's place and thus became acquainted. He did not know about the kidnapping, but the people had committed kidnapping cases repeatedly and knew that their crimes were heinous. He asked the court to sentence him to death quickly. After saying this, his eyes filled with tears. The Chinese and Western officials ordered him to be taken back into custody to await consultation and the pronouncement of the court's judgment.</p>

<p>A garbage truck of the French Municipal Council hits and kills Dong Weichun on a bicycle</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 7:40 AM, at the intersection of Zhaozhou Road and Jiangbei Great World Jingjiang Public Office, on the border between the Chinese and French territories, a young man riding his own bicycle from north to south was suddenly struck by garbage truck No. 35 of the Engineering Department of the French Concession Municipal Council, driven by Tang Si (39 years old, from Shandong), driving from south to north. The collision caused the young man and the bicycle to fall to the ground, injuring his chest and abdomen. He died instantly before he could be treated. The deceased's name and other details are as follows: The deceased was Dong Weichun, 24 years old, from Ningbo, who owned the Tonghetai Candy and Fried Goods Store at No. 335 Fangxie Road. In the spring of the 14th year of the Republic of China (1925), he married Ms. Chen, 21 years old, from Ningbo, who was the niece of Chen Peiyuan, manager of the Antai Transportation Company at the South Railway Station. They had a son and a daughter. The eldest daughter was named Gui Di, 6 years old, and the second son was named Xin Di, also known as Yongchun, 2 years old. The deceased's father was Dong Xingren, 51 years old, and his mother was Ms. Yu, 55 years old. They had only one son, Weichun. They now own the Tongqianhe Candy and Fried Goods Store at No. 17 Daxing Street outside the Xiaoximen. They moved here from Xinxin Bridge in the French Concession thirty years ago. They also own another store, the Shentaichang Candy and Fried Goods Store on Kandi Road in the French Concession. They have a total of three stores, old and new, with retail and wholesale operations. Dong Weichun was honest and diligent, and he also managed and ran errands for the Tonghetai New Store, soliciting goods and collecting accounts. Therefore, yesterday morning at 6:30 AM, he left the store and rode his newly purchased bicycle to the Beishi to solicit goods at the shops of the same trade. He was returning to the store when the accident occurred. When the garbage truck and the bicycle collided, a patrol officer from the Second District saw it and immediately stepped forward to detain the garbage truck and the driver Tang Si. They were taken to the district for interrogation, and police were dispatched to take care of and examine the deceased's body. It was learned that he was Dong Weichun, the owner of the Tonghetai Candy Store. Since he could not be sent to the hospital for treatment in time, his family was notified to come and claim the body for burial. The police district then notified the French Municipal Council to negotiate the matter. Around 9:00 AM, the deceased's wife, Ms. Chen, heard the news from the police and immediately asked someone to report to her father, Dong Xingren, and mother, Ms. Yu, and other relatives at the Tongqianhe Candy Store outside Xiaoximen. They went to the scene one after another and embraced the body and cried bitterly. It was unbearable to witness. Later, at 1:30 PM, the body was transported to the Ningbo Guild Hall for burial. His father, Dong Xingren, submitted a request to the local court to waive the autopsy and requested that the driver of the offending vehicle, Tang Si, be brought to justice.</p>

<p>The Wusong Eighth District Party Department believes that the Shanghai Special Municipality Land Bureau, Baoshan County Government Finance Bureau jointly issued a notice urging the collection of old grain from 1927, which has been exempted, violates the orders of the National Government. It has submitted a report to the Municipal Party Department to forward it to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering the revocation of the order and punishing the chief officials of the three agencies. The Baoshan County Government and others have presented a report to the Jiangsu Provincial Government stating that the Eighth District Party Department misunderstood the exemption and affected the collection process, and that the provincial government has instructed that the busy grain from 1927 is not in the scope of exemption, and that there has long been a clear order announced that it should be strictly pursued. In addition to notifying the Provincial Party Department, it should also be issued jointly for public knowledge, etc. Therefore, the Baoshan County Government and others have jointly issued a notice with the Land Bureau to dispel public doubts.</p>

<p>Four people arrested for collecting money under false pretenses at the new vegetable market</p>
<p>To be sent to court for interrogation this morning</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Police Department recently learned that unscrupulous elements at the new vegetable market at the intersection of Simalu and Zhejiang Road were collecting activity fees of ten yuan per stall from the stallholders. There are 500 stall spaces in the market. If calculated at ten yuan per stall, the amount would be considerable. Recently, some stallholders have paid ten yuan but have not yet obtained a stall space, so they reported it to the Municipal Council Police Department. Yesterday afternoon, the Laozha Patrol Room received a report from an informant that unscrupulous elements who were collecting fees under false pretenses were currently collecting fees at the market. The detectives rushed to the market and arrested four major suspects on the spot. They are scheduled to be sent to the court this morning for trial.</p>

<p>Son dies suddenly</p>
<p>Kicked in the chest</p>
<p>Awaiting doctor's examination</p>
<p>Old mother cries</p>
<p>A widow named Liu Mei, of Wenzhou, who lives above the Baoda firewood and charcoal shop at the corner of Tianji Lane, West Sichuan Road, lost her husband last year. Her only son, Liu Ridong, 13, was an apprentice at the Wanhua Cheng Laundry owned by Zhang Binghao, No. 2, Jiuxing Lane, Juplais Road in the French Concession, who was also from her hometown. He was intelligent and deeply valued by his master. One day two months ago, the apprentice, Liu, was squatting on the floor inside his shop, not knowing what work he was doing, when a guest, Hu Arong (age 28, from Shaoxing), called to Liu and kicked him hard in the chest when he failed to respond. Liu fell back to the ground and spat out blood three times. His master learned of this and sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he returned to work in the shop. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, Liu suddenly died at 2 p.m. The boss reported the death to the French police, who ordered a detective to arrest Hu Arong, the perpetrator. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for a post-mortem examination. Liu's mother and witness Zhang Binghao were notified. Yesterday, the police reported to the French Court and Judge Zhu oversaw the post-mortem examination. Given the unclear circumstances of the death, he ordered that photographs be taken and that a Western doctor be sent to report the details of the examination to the court before further verification of the body was carried out. After the examination, the body could be buried by the family. Before the examination, the old mother suddenly saw her only son die an unnatural death and wept loudly. Her companions tried to dissuade her and only stopped after the examination was complete. She left despondently.</p>

<p>Defendant's Store Transfer Content is Complex</p>
<p>Plaintiff Provides 30% Guarantee</p>
<p>The owner of Yi Sheng Chang wool store on Rue de Montauban in the French Concession, represented by a lawyer, filed a lawsuit in the French court, stating that Tong Tai Xing wool store at No. 74 on the same street owed the plaintiff a total of 13,287 taels of silver. Unexpectedly, on the 5th of this month, the store owner's wife, Ms. Ye Sun, privately transferred the store to Heng Ji, operated by lawyers Zhang Ai Kui and Yang Keng, who published a statement in the newspaper and secretly changed the store's name at night, disregarding the debt to the plaintiff. Therefore, the plaintiff urgently filed a lawsuit requesting an emergency measure to temporarily seize the store. They argued that this type of store transfer was completely fraudulent, and in reality, it was still the same business attempting to evade debt, which is legally invalid. They requested a strict investigation of Tong Tai Xing, Heng Ji, and Shao Zhong Ying. Lawyers representing the defendants stated that their clients had a formal contract for the transfer of the store, with lawyers providing proof, with a total price of 11,200 yuan, and four checks from Jun Chang Zhuang could prove the payment. They pointed out that Tong Tai Xing only transferred part of the store to Heng Ji, and Tong Tai Xing still operated part of the business themselves. They questioned why the plaintiff did not investigate clearly before rashly filing a case and requesting a seizure, which was unreasonable, and requested the case be dismissed. Ms. Ye Sun was also represented by a lawyer who argued that the defendant, Ms. Sun, currently resided in the Chinese territory, and the plaintiff's claim was under the wrong jurisdiction, and requested the case be rejected. Judge Gong ordered the plaintiff to provide a 30% guarantee and postponed the case for further review.</p>

He often came to ask for money, and when she refused, he lured her nephew out, got him drunk, and harmed him. When questioned, Geng and others did not admit to the accusation. All the witnesses were sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Thank you for introducing "The Essentials of Humanitarianism" in your newspaper. In recent days, requests for copies have exceeded ten thousand. The initial and second printings of 20,000 copies have been gradually exhausted, but requests continue to pour in. Our factory owner is sparing no expense to continue printing a third edition of ten thousand copies to meet the demand. The printing is currently in full swing, so requests from various places cannot be sent out immediately and must wait for several days. They will be sent out one by one without any omission. However, future requests must include a postal fee of two and a half cents (please note "Request for Book" on the envelope). We hope your newspaper will announce this on our behalf so that those requesting books will not have to wait anxiously. With best wishes for your well-being.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The General Affairs Department of the Wuxi Shen Xin Third Textile Company</p>

The Tongshan Normal School Experimental Elementary School was holding its spring sports meet on the playground near the Longhai North Station. The lively young students were eagerly rubbing their fists and preparing to take the field and show off their skills. Chiang stopped to watch and said to the school's teachers and staff: "I will give a considerable prize to the first place in each group to encourage the children." It turned out that the morning's sports program was track and field, and the students had been divided into four groups, A, B, C, and D, who would compete in turn. Some of the students recognized Chiang and told each other, and the whole venue cheered to welcome Chairman Chiang. Chiang nodded in response. After the final races, Chiang distributed awards, including a certificate for Guo Dian Cheng, first place in Group A, with the words "Victory" written on it; a certificate for Li Yun Cheng, first place in Group B, with the words "Progress" written on it; a certificate for Ding Zhen Dong, first place in Group C, with the words "Success" written on it; and a certificate for Liu Cheng Xin, first place in Group D, with the words "Swiftness" written on it. The certificates were all made of brocade and the words were written by Chairman Chiang himself. He then ordered his attendants to return to the camp train and bring a large number of biscuit cans and canned goods to donate to the children of the whole school. He also gave a speech, saying: "The physique of the Chinese people has never been strong and is often ridiculed by foreigners. I hope that you young students will exercise every day to make your bodies strong, so that not only will you not be looked down upon by foreigners, but our strength against foreign powers will also be increased invisibly. What worries should the country have? What worries should there be about not being able to defeat imperialism? The National Games will be held in Beijing next April. You young students should practice hard and go there to participate. I will be waiting for you in Beijing. We are currently in the period of suppressing the rebellion, and military affairs are very busy. As soon as the military affairs on the front lines are over, I will go to your school again for a deep talk." His attitude was gentle and his smile was kind. He also strolled along the grass path, admiring the willow branches and mountain scenery for an hour before returning to the camp.</p>
<h3 id="e213">The Stone-Throwing Festival - Gu Shi De <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>In our county, every year during the abolished lunar calendar Arbor Day, there is a custom of throwing stones with the neighboring village of Liu She. According to the elders, this tradition has been passed down for more than sixty years. It must be held once a year, otherwise, it will not be auspicious. Liu She is close to Taihu Lake, while our county is slightly southwest, but they are very close to each other. The peach and willow trees at the end of the villages are connected, and the bank of Taihu Lake is used as the war zone. On that day, tourists are like clouds, and red-clad men and green-clad women are like butterflies flitting back and forth. The barren hills are full of spectators. At noon, the banks begin to be bombarded with stones. At first, stone fragments are thrown remotely to correspond to the traditional custom of warding off disasters. By the time of the late afternoon, there are many spectators on both sides, and the number of stone-throwers who automatically join in increases greatly. Each person throws sharp stones bravely at each other. Those who are unfortunately hit by stones are wounded and bleed. The winners are elated, and the spectators of both villages shout according to the victory or defeat of their own side. The foolish state is very interesting. They must fight fiercely until dusk before each side returns home. The annual stone-throwing festival is thus announced to be over.</p>
<p>Those who heard of it praised Chairman Chiang's composure.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Snippets from the Four Universities English Speech Contest - Hua Hua <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Jiaotong, Fudan, Jinan, and Guanghua Universities held the English speech contest on the 21st at Fudan University. As a result, Jiaotong University won the team first place, and Ms. Wang Heng Ling, a female student from Jiaotong University, won the individual first place. Now, I will extract and record the snippets from the competition.</p>
<p>Dr. Hu's witty remarks provoked laughter: On that day, Dr. Hu Shi served as the chairman. Each actor who stepped onto the stage had to say "Chairman" and bow to him. Dr. Hu responded with a smile. After the performance, the chairman usually had a few closing remarks. Dr. Hu took the opportunity to make witty remarks, saying that today, he had nothing to do but take up the seat of the chairman, which could only be described as "Chairman" in English and not in Chinese, because he was only sitting on a chair and doing nothing, just as the English "Chairman" can be translated literally as "chair-sitting person." The audience burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The joy and suffering of the judges varied: The judges on that day were Chen Ting Rui, Ou Yuan Huai, and Bauer (editor-in-chief of the "Millard's Review"). To prevent the judges from consulting with each other, the judges' seats were spaced far apart. However, the venue was quite large, and the judges sitting in the back had to concentrate their thoughts and listen carefully to be able to hear clearly. One of the judges told others afterward that he had used up a lot of his ear power today, and he was quite indignant about the joy and suffering varying among the other judges.</p>
<p>Sharing honors equally: This competition only took four places. As a result, Wang Heng Ling (Jiaotong) was first, Liu Sheng Qi (Guanghua) was second, Zhu Zi Fen (Fudan) was third, and Lin Qing Chi (Jinan) was fourth. Each of the four universities that participated won a place, and no one was left out. Some said that this could be described as sharing honors equally. The beauty scheme can only be used once: In last year's Mandarin competition, a female student from Jinan won first place. This year, that student did not win an award. The audience all said that the beauty scheme had failed. This time, Jiaotong again added a female student and won the award. Therefore, when some bored members of the audience were leaving, they shouted loudly (warning Jiaotong that the beauty scheme can only be used once, take the previous incident in Jinan as a warning), and so on. In fact, Ms. Wang's participation in the speech was not from this session, but had been for the first and second time. Only this session did she win the award.</p>

<p>The two Zhangs from Sichuan are called Shan Zi and Da Qian, who are famous painters of this era. They are capable of everything in painting. Shan Zi is especially good at tigers and horses, and Da Qian is good at landscapes. Although many painters are known in this era, there may be no one who can compare with them. Now, Da Qian has exhibited his works at the Ningbo Fellow Association, including one hundred paintings, as well as dozens of fan paintings with the combined calligraphy and painting of the two Zhangs. Da Qian's flowers are modeled after Bai Yang and Ba Da, his figures are modeled after Liu Ru and Xin Luo, and his landscapes are modeled after Shi Tao. This is known to everyone. What he has learned not only obtains the appearance but also the spirit, and his exquisite works even surpass the ancients. He is truly worthy of praise for surpassing his predecessors. For example, the peonies, peonies, lotuses, chrysanthemums, pomegranates, and crabapples he made this time are simple, elegant, and full of unconstrained interest, which is already enough to make people marvel. His imitation of Zhao Zi Gu's daffodils is graceful and even more lovely. The figures, such as Mei Du, Lao Zi, Lu Shang, Guan Ling Yin Xi, Ji Kang, Dong Po, and Zhong Kui, are dignified and leisurely, allowing viewers to leisurely recall the past and feel awe and respect. They are not only remarkable in terms of brush and ink. He has the most landscapes, and they are also the most exquisite. He has imitated Shi Tao in more than twenty paintings, each of which is exquisite. Even those who</p>

<p>On April 17th, departed from Chicago by train, traveling to the highest point of the Rocky Mountains. The weather was extremely warm, and the flowers and trees were in full bloom, creating a beautiful and unparalleled landscape.</p>
<p>On the 24th, arrived in San Francisco at 5 PM. Upon disembarking, several thousand people were at the station to greet him. The number of people watching the spectacle was about thirty to forty thousand, a truly unprecedented scene. The Mayor of San Francisco, the President of the Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Consul-General in San Francisco, and the President of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce all personally came to the station to welcome him. A great many people presented flowers. The Mayor gave a speech on the spot, delivering a welcoming address. After the speech, Wanhua and the Mayor rode together in a large open-top car, led by the city's band. The car we were in, as well as the cars of those welcoming us, followed in a continuous line for about a mile. Each car was fully adorned with the flags of both China and America. A banner of welcome was prominently displayed in front of Wanhua's car. It happened to be Sunday, and many of the stores in the southern district were closed, so the spectators filled the roads, causing traffic to be blocked, and all removed their hats as a sign of respect. The band played music as we slowly proceeded through the bustling streets to Chinatown, causing traffic to be completely stopped. More than a dozen police officers on motorcycles directed everything back and forth. After arriving at the welcome venue, it was already a sea of people. The Mayor's speech briefly stated: "I originally had other important matters today, but I deliberately put them aside and rushed to the station to welcome him, because Mr. Mei's visit to America has indeed greatly increased the friendship between China and America. Moreover, the Chinese community in San Francisco accounts for half of the city's construction efforts. Mr. Mei's art is profound. I welcome him from head to toe with sincere enthusiasm and dare to represent the entire city, the entire state, and the entire nation in welcoming him," and so on. Wanhua's reply contained the most persuasive words, saying, "The feeling I have upon arriving in San Francisco this time is that everyone always thinks of the Pacific Ocean as separating China and America. However, I believe that the Pacific Ocean was naturally created to connect China and America." At this point, there was thunderous applause from the audience.</p>
<p>On the 21st, Wanhua visited the Mayor at the City Hall. When the Municipal Council learned of the visit, they immediately suspended the Municipal Council meeting and changed it into a welcoming reception, inviting Wanhua to sit in the chairman's seat. A council member gave a long welcoming speech. After the speech, Wanhua gave a reply speech lasting several tens of minutes. The speech was translated, recorded by a stenographer, and preserved forever. Before departing, he took a group photo with the council members as a memento.</p>
<p>On the 23rd, the women's association with voting rights held a tea party. Upon his arrival, everyone stood up and welcomed him with utmost sincerity. More than two hundred people attended the meeting that day.</p>
<p>On the 24th, it was the state-wide women's association tea party, with three hundred people in attendance. Only one seat was provided for Wanhua, while everyone else stood. There were also speeches given.</p>
<p>It is now planned to perform for seven days at the foreign theater here and five days at the Chinese theater. After the performances, they will go to Los Angeles to perform for ten days and study movies in Hollywood along the way.</p>
<p>Da Dizi Fusheng must also completely prostrate himself. What's even more wonderful is that he did fifteen sketches of the Diamond Mountains. Daqian enjoys travel. Having already left Mount Emei, descended the Wu Gorge, stayed at Lingyin Temple, ascended Mount Tai, traveled north to the borderlands, and toured Wu and Yue in the south, last year he also traveled throughout Shilla and Baekje, exhausting the beauty of the Diamond Mountains. Therefore, his brushwork has become more divine. The Diamond Mountains are so prominent, strange, and steep, beyond the imagination. The help of the landscape is why painters must travel thousands of miles. Daqian had never painted Shi Xi before, but after casually creating two paintings, he rendered the bald remnants colorless. We mediocre people can only burn the inkstones in the burial mound to avoid being ashamed to die. Daqian's nature is scattered. Sometimes he doesn't write a single stroke for dozens of days, but when the mood strikes, he paints freely and vividly, like a fierce wind and torrential rain, making a rattling sound. He can produce dozens of paintings in a day. Truly, he is unfathomable. He can be called a prodigy of the painting world.</p>
<h3 id="e217">A Record of Visiting the Chinese Literary and Artistic School by Qingping <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>I have been a guest in Peiping for a long time. Yesterday, I returned to Shanghai to visit my old friend Manqing at Weixue Cottage. It has been five years since our last meeting. After exchanging greetings and reminiscing about the past, we each shared our feelings about life. Manqing led me to visit the Chinese Literary and Artistic School. The school building is secluded and elegant, with bright windows and clean tables, long grass and fragrant flowers, which is quite in line with the artistic concept. Ancient and modern paintings are hung in the room, all of which are the calligraphy and paintings of famous artists. In the Chenxi Pavilion, ancient books fill the shelves, all of which are exquisitely engraved editions. The "Cefu Yuangui", "Yuhai", "Taiping Yulan", and other books each have more than a thousand volumes, which is especially rare in other schools. Manqing then took out the works of his disciples and invited me to evaluate them. I believe that the students at this school have made such rapid progress in just one semester, thanks to the teaching of their teacher. Now, after briefly observing the achievements of each student, I know that the relationship between teacher and student is deep. Our country's literature and art originated thousands of years ago. Since the import of European culture, the national arts have been relegated to the status of vassals. Recently, society has begun to pay more attention to the national arts, but they are still as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. My friend Manqing braved the thorns and established an art school. His painstaking efforts are truly commendable and valuable. Moreover, he has also received the assistance of Ye Yufu, Yu Youren, Chu Minyi, and other gentlemen to maintain and support the school, so that the foundation of the school can be consolidated. Is this not the good fortune of the students of this school? It is heard that a teacher-student exhibition will be held at the Ningbo Fellow Association on that day. It is estimated that there will be four or five hundred works. The spring breeze and peach and plum blossoms will gather in one hall, with colorful lights and a dazzling scene, which will surely delight and dazzle the viewers. To promote our country's inherent culture lies in this, lies in this!</p>

<p>Zuo Shichen asked, "So, have you already bought them?" Liu Xingxu said, "Almost. I said I would buy them, and I paid him two hundred yuan as a deposit, because I haven't received the translation fee of one thousand yuan yet. After I receive it, I can hand over the money, and then I can take the things." Zuo Shichen said, "This is a happy thing. Do you want to send these two things to the woman's house first, to your fiancée?" Liu Xingxu said, "Our Suzhou custom is to send a large platter once a month before the wedding, and all six rituals are sent on that day. I also want to attach these two things to the day I send the large platter." Zuo Shichen said, "So, everything is according to Suzhou wedding customs?" Liu Xingxu said, "Not necessarily. We are following our Suzhou customs. If they are not satisfied and want to follow Huzhou customs, we will listen to them. Fortunately, I am completely in charge of this wedding. My father is not in charge of my affairs, so I will do my best." Time passed like flowing water. In the blink of an eye, it was time for Liu Xingxu's wedding. As a result of Xingxu's efforts in recent years, he handled it very perfectly. He originally had a wide range of acquaintances. Just counting his classmates, there were dozens in Shanghai. In addition, there were quite a few scattered in various places. All Chinese celebrations and condolences are often regarded as major events. Among relatives and friends, even people who don't usually interact will always come to the celebrations and condolences. There is also a reason: it depends on your own social life. If you yourself don't socialize much, people will be lazy. If you are a person who enjoys socializing, people can't help but come. This is called reciprocity. Liu Xingxu is a person who likes to socialize. He goes to every celebration and condolence, no matter how busy he is. Therefore, now that he has encountered his own happy event, people also need to come and respond. On that day, he borrowed the large hotel of Yipinxian and invited Tang Zhaoyi as the wedding officiant. The guests filled the door and it was very lively. When it came to the wedding, everyone crowded to see the newlyweds. That Miss Fang was truly graceful and elegant, and she and Liu Xingxu could be called a perfect match, a talented man and a beautiful woman, a good match made in heaven. It's a pity that Liu Xingxu has been tired recently. The root of his illness has not been removed. During this honeymoon, he took a month's leave from the bookstore because they didn't go on a honeymoon trip. Therefore, he still went to the newspaper office in the evening once in a while. He still had to come out once a day and couldn't hide at home all day long. However, he came home much earlier than usual. There was also one more thing. Before he got married, he also liked to eat and drink and call for courtesans. Since he got married, he has also stopped doing this. His friends asked him if he wasn't keeping his new wife's rules after marrying her?</p>

<h3 id="e220">Major Turmoil in the Gold Market Last Week <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Silver tax issues cause disturbances.</p>
<p>Speculative trading is aimless.</p>
<p>High and low: 15 taels and 5 qian.</p>
<p>Result: Increase of 2 taels.</p>
<p>The gold market was unusually chaotic last week, with significant fluctuations, often rising or falling by five or six taels. The proposal by the national government to collect import taxes on silver in cash caused rumors and disputes, creating panic among the industry. The atmosphere in the market was confused, and speculative trading was aimless. Overall, the market was disturbed by the air, creating turmoil. On Monday, it reached an unprecedented peak of 528 taels and 5 qian. On Wednesday, it plummeted, nearly collapsing to 513 taels (although the black market only reached 502 taels). The market stabilized by the weekend. Although the British and American silver markets and exchange rates had set new records, they were not correlated with the gold price and were almost inversely proportional. However, the result was slightly higher than the previous Saturday. The details of the past six days are summarized below:</p>
<p>Early in the week (19th), large bars of silver trended lower, and the exchange market contracted by half a notch. The internal market was strong, but the gold price was extremely chaotic. The market fluctuated by more than 9 taels. Buyers were excited, and the early market jumped to a new peak of 528 taels and 5 qian. However, after rumors spread that passports were required for cash imports, it fell sharply. The market closed more than 20 taels lower. The next day, the market was even more chaotic. Due to the rumor that the silver tax would be implemented on a trial basis for six months, panic arose. The market opened with a drop of six or seven taels, and then suddenly fell to 513 taels (although the black market outside the arena only reached 12 taels). At noon, it was learned that a Reuters report stated that the tax could be avoided, and it immediately rebounded, soaring by ten taels. The market closed soft, as large holders sold. The difference between the high and low was eleven taels and a half that day. On Wednesday, the low price of large bars of silver did not move. The rumor that the silver tax was about to be implemented again opened at a lower price. After hearing that the black market had reached 502 taels, the market jumped five or six taels due to buyer activity. The market closed at around 18 taels. The next day, although the large bars and exchange rates contracted, the internal prices were initially strong and then softened. Therefore, the gold market went from firm to weak. In the early morning, it was 24 taels and 5 qian, but then it plummeted by eight or nine taels. Throughout the day, there was a fluctuation of 9 taels. On Friday, the market was calm, but there was still a fluctuation of 5 taels and a half. The government denied the tax, and the people's hearts were firm. On Saturday, the market fluctuated by 4 taels and 2 qian in half a day. However, the large bars returned to their length, and the exchange rate was clearly loose but secretly tight. Therefore, the gold price was 519 taels, which was 2 taels higher than the previous Saturday. The high and low prices for this week were 15 taels and 5 qian. Looking back, the high and low prices for the British and American silver prices and exchange rates are listed below:</p>
<p>Type Highest Lowest Compared to Last Saturday</p>
<p>Large bar near 19 pence 18 pence 625 Reduced by half a penny</p>

The near term was reduced by 125 to 18 pence 625 (equivalent to 1 shilling 10 pence in English gold), and the long term was also reduced by 125 to 18 pence 562.

<h3 id="e222">Bond Market: Large Rise in Disbandment Bonds Last Week <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>The market was extremely prosperous, with transactions totaling over 64 million yuan.</p>
<p>The current market conditions for various bonds in Shanghai last week remained clear. The total turnover for the whole week was only 114,700 yuan, of which Disbandment Bonds accounted for 86,000 yuan and Disaster Relief Bonds accounted for 17,000 yuan. The others only had a few thousand yuan each. Futures were still lively, with Disbandment Bonds being the most active. All parties had huge transactions. Although Customs Bonds were good, there was no significant progress. The total turnover for the whole week reached 64.71 million yuan, an increase of more than 17.3 million yuan compared to the previous week. Disbandment Bonds for May reached 7.90 million yuan, and for June reached 16.97 million yuan. Customs Bonds for May reached 5.57 million yuan, and for June reached 8.225 million yuan. Demobilization Bonds also far exceeded the previous figures, with May reaching 1.14 million yuan and June reaching 7.145 million yuan. Post-Reorganization Public Bonds for May reached 3.3005 million yuan, and for June reached 2.66 million yuan. Reorganization 6% Bonds for May reached 1.895 million yuan, and for June reached 2.93 million yuan. Other series were calm, with Series 5 for May reaching 1.34 million yuan and for June reaching 1.465 million yuan. Series 25 accounted for 965,000 yuan in May and 760,000 yuan in June. 96 Public Bonds were 875,000 yuan in May and 1.065 million yuan in June. 7-year financial figures were sparse, with 7-year figures accounting for 300,000 yuan in May and 40,000 yuan in June. Financial Bonds only reached 160,000 yuan in May. During the week, the price changes of each bond were as follows: The two types of Disbandment Bonds and Demobilization Bonds increased more strongly. The bond market environment was good, and investment purchases increased. Disbandment Bonds and Demobilization Bonds were lower than other bonds, and local revenue was also the most active. Therefore, the demand for supply in the market was also far less than before. Bond prices rose sharply due to the relationship between the promised supply and the supply. The Disbandment Bonds stabilized at the beginning of the week, but rose by one yuan, several jiao, and even more than two yuan on the remaining days. Compared to the previous week, spot prices rose by about five yuan and futures reached six yuan, several jiao. In addition, the prices of Demobilization Bonds and Customs Bonds also increased, with Demobilization Bonds rising by 3 yuan and 78 jiao and Customs Bonds rising by more than 2 yuan. Other bonds, except for Disaster Relief Bonds, which rose by 1 yuan and 1 jiao, all remained at a high price. The market supply and demand were balanced, and the price remained stable, fluctuating by only a few jiao each day. The stability was far better than the previous week. Compared to the previous weekend, there were mutual increases and decreases. Except for 7-year spot goods, which were 3 yuan and 8 jiao higher than the beginning of the previous week, and Post-Reorganization futures, which fell by 78 jiao, the other bonds only had a few jiao of changes. The high and low price statistics of each bond during the last week are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton declined due to favorable forecasts in the west and good cotton harvest conditions. Futures fell by 10 to 16 points, and spot prices fell by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 3 to 4 points, and spot prices fell by 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. Indian cotton declined due to political instability and clearing by both parties. Pingguoer, Aomula, and Bailuoxi all fell by 5 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left.

<p>Near-term East Cotton sold short, the trend is towards a decline.</p>
<p>Far-term Han Gang is making more, slightly raised.</p>
<p>The cotton market situation is inherently flat and tired, while the Han Biao trend is quite firm, which is good because the Han Gang is tightening and not letting go, and must enter whenever there is a fall. The intention is to make more because the Han market is high and the spot goods are thin, and the source is affected by the harassment of the Communist bandits, and it is quite lacking. However, various factories are quiet because they have fully absorbed the need for Indian cotton, and a certain manufacturer is selling off in large quantities in the distant months. However, the source of foreign cotton is difficult to match due to the strange shrinkage of the exchange rate. Therefore, the new flowers in October are strange. Traders and Han Gang are very enthusiastic about doing more. This month's standard cotton was dumped by Dong cotton and fell. The monthly Han Gang purchased and rose 34 yuan. The total weekly turnover of American cotton was 137,100 Dan. 1,450 bales of Yaohua and 750 bales of Tonghua are calculated from the source. Manufacturers entered 12,212 Dan and the shop entered 2,225 Dan. The amount purchased by manufacturers and shops is recorded separately below.</p>

<p>More than 30,000 packages of spot goods opened.</p>
<p>The selling price of the current period rose by 12 taels.</p>
<p>The yarn market was extremely tired at the beginning of the week, with a weak situation, because the general situation in the world was not good. Although the three-grade yarn was related to the exchange rate, the falling wind was too strong and the combined price was low. The price of American cotton also fluctuated, and the war was looming in the current situation. It is said that the buyers are powerful because the factory is tightening up and will not let go of the opportunity. Therefore, they have the ability to hold on for a long time. Later, at the weekend, Guangbang suddenly purchased spot yarn, and most of the purchases were 10-count coarse yarn. The goods purchased were shipped to Guangxi for sale. Before long, the Sichuan and Yunnan gangs also followed suit, purchasing about 20,000 packs of coarse and fine yarn in two days, most of which were local yarn. With this large batch of sales, the factories felt relieved of their stockpiles, and the people in the field were greatly shocked. The standard yarn buying was also fierce. Scattered households saw that the environment had improved and had to get on with it. The buyers were assisted by this and their attitude became stronger. The large long-term holders saw that the opportunity had come and cut 1,500 bales of the unsalable goods of the 20-count Wufu Shouyang product and sold them to Guangbang at a low price. On the one hand, they increased their purchases this month. Therefore, the closing price of the standard yarn on Saturday was still very high. However, the current inventory has not been sold out, and there is no power to rise sharply for the time being. If the purchases from all parties continue to come, the future will continue to rise. In short, after this batch of business started to improve, the burden on each factory was reduced. For a while, it was not easy to tend towards a small surface. As a result, the price of the standard yarn rose by 1 tael and 2 qian to 2 taels and 2 qian in the near month, and by 2 taels in the distant month. The total weekly turnover was 73,100 bales. Various gangs purchased a total of 29,355 bales of spot yarn, and 2,500 bales entered the peers. The market increased by 12 taels. The number of packages purchased by various gangs is recorded separately below.</p>

<p>The cocoon dealers in the concession are releasing prices and competing to collect foreign cocoons. The price of foreign cocoons opened at 90 yuan. In the cities and towns of Suzhou and Wu County, this year's new cocoon harvest is not abundant. The number of cocoon dealers has increased sharply, and there are more dealers than goods. The price of cocoons is expected to be high. In addition, Japanese cocoon dealers in the concession are releasing prices and competing to collect foreign cocoons. The price of high-quality foreign cocoons opened at 90 yuan, and the price of high-quality local cocoons opened at 68 yuan. The price of foreign cocoons in the four villages also opened at 80 yuan, and the price of local cocoons opened at 667 yuan. The quality of the cocoons is still good, it is said.</p>

<p>Each dealer collected 23,000 Dan, and the price was 65 yuan. This year, about 20 cocoon dealers opened in the Gongchen Bridge area of Hangzhou. They were all leased by silk manufacturers in this city. They opened the scales to collect cocoons for about 145 days. Each dealer collected more than 23,000 Dan. The cocoon market is over, and the average price of cocoons has to be 65 yuan.</p>

<p>The silk market in Shanghai turned from tired to rise in the middle of last week. The reason was that the foreign exchange rate changed drastically at the beginning of the week, and the foreign silk sales did not move. European dealers watched and waited, and there was no possibility of progress in the market. By the second half of the week, the exchange rate had turned firm and US sales were launched. The price of silk in New York was reported to be rising, and the silk electricity gradually turned to Shanghai. US, French, and other dealers successively sold and purchased Shanghai white factory goods. Each manufacturer said that the new cocoon harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year was poor and the price of cocoons was not cheap. The silk cost was still expensive, and they had to sell the time silk. They insisted that they would not sell at a loss. As a result, 300 packs of new and old Tongjie Shanghai factory goods were traded in June, and the price of silk rose sharply by 230 taels. The price of overseas Chinese silk rose by a different amount. 700 packs of old silk were shipped out last week. The market price of Chinese silk in the European and American markets at the end of last week is listed below (New York price per pound, unit: gold dollar; Lyon price per kilogram, unit: francs):</p>

<p>Yesterday, deliveries to Zhabei from the river amounted to only about ten shipments, and sales in various stores were sluggish. Sales of northern rice were especially slow, because the end of the month and the Dragon Boat Festival were approaching, and stores were inevitably taking a wait-and-see approach due to various procedural issues. Therefore, only a small amount of retail sales and some local street trading took place. High-quality rice was still priced steadily, but special grades were only between $20.05 and $20.06. Medium-grade and sub-grade fresh northern rice varied in price and quality, with some being processed and others remaining in their original state, with a price fluctuation of about half a cent. Medium-grade and sub-grade aged rice was not only priced lower but also no one was buying it. However, the river had the largest stock of this type of rice, so trading was sparse throughout the day. High-quality Bo Rice remained stable, while other grades showed signs of fatigue. Although deliveries were scarce, sales were not high. Because medium-grade and sub-grade rice were mostly removed, high prices remained at $20. The Yangdu short-grain rice market continued to be quiet, with sales mainly consisting of foreign rice. Market trading was unusually quiet and fluid. As the Dragon Boat Festival approached, deliveries slightly increased, but buyers were unusually cautious. Although trading volume was not weak, prices often varied according to batches. Therefore, ordinary rice remained around $18.50.</p>
<p>Sources to the Shanghai South districts were scarce, with only a few shipments, and the trend remained normal. Both Xibei northern rice and Su Tongji rice were in short supply, and sales were brisk. All day, only local street sales made slight progress, and there was no significant decline in large orders. High-quality Chang rice was $20, and Su rice was $19. Thin early rice from Songjiang, Sijing, Xitang, Qingjiao, and other areas in the South continued to decline, and sales showed no development. Only high-quality early rice was slightly active, so prices were somewhat adjusted. The market situation was very weak, and Yangdu short-grain rice showed a slight decline, with sales slightly improving and prices remaining stable. The flow of both Tumen rice and Yin rice was rare, and the situation was mediocre. High-quality Yin rice was priced at $17.12.</p>

<p>After the price of white tung oil from foreign firms in Hankou fell to 22.8 taels, Sichuan tung oil opened at 21.3 taels, and Tung tung oil opened at 20.06 taels, all from customer orders. However, repeated price drops caused significant losses for customers, so customers with strong capital generally adopted a strategy of waiting and seeing. Various foreign firms, seeing that further price drops were unlikely in the short term, completed transactions for more than 1,000 tons over the past week, with prices remaining at 22.8 and 22.85 taels. Merchants' inventories were not high, and the sudden fire at Demao Warehouse resulted in losses of over 10,000 dan. Spot oil in the market was in short supply. According to yesterday's Hankou telegram, Wuxiang tung oil had increased to 20.08 taels, and the market seemed to be slightly turning around, with a bit more activity than before. However, foreign firms remained between 22.8 and 22.9 taels, lacking sufficient momentum and not allowing for a rapid rise. There would only be a large drop followed by a small rebound.</p>

<p>Recent trading in eastern galvanized iron has been very active, with strong demand from various ports along the Yangtze River and provinces like Fujian and Zhejiang. Local street trade has also been widespread, so daily transactions total 6,000 to 7,000 sheets. However, after the continuous rise of the Eastern Exchange Rate, there have been very few new orders. Because supplies are scarce, the market is very strong, and prices are continuously rising. Currently, 3'x7' sheets are estimated at 98 cents per sheet, and 3'x6' sheets are 77.5 cents, an increase of 0.5 cents compared to before. As the Eastern Exchange Rate is unlikely to ease, and there may be few future deliveries, it is unlikely that prices will soften.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Mr. Ying Yunwei, the Director I Know by Wu Zhen <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>Since our (Lady Windermere's Fan) was performed at school and in Shanghai, I have deeply come to know this good teacher, Mr. Ying Yunwei. If our performance was a success, then we can only say that it was entirely Mr. Ying's success, because this was entirely the result of Mr. Ying's hard work and guidance in February.</p>
<p>I don't know what kind of power he has that made more than a dozen of us actors obey and admire him. Although he is just a very young youth, we became friends with him as soon as we met him on the first day. Although he is our most powerful director, he is very kind to us. Even if he is angry sometimes, we can see his fiery heart in his angry face. He treats our affairs as his own, sacrificing the company's holidays, and sacrificing a whole year's holiday and Christmas holiday. He worked hard at school to direct our work. As a result, he caught a bad cold from running around in the ice and snow for days and fell ill. When we went to see him, he was still saying (You have to read the script very well. As soon as I get better, I will rehearse for you and take care of all the backstage and front-of-house arrangements for the performance). He is so enthusiastic and sincere to us that we are almost moved to tears. Fortunately, he recovered in a few days. After recovering, he did not recuperate but worked even harder, so that we got a lot of fun from the school performance, and we also got a considerable estimate from the performance in the Central Auditorium. He did not know how much energy and time he lost for our performance this time, but he did not regret it. Moreover, after each performance, he was as happy and cheering as we were. Ah, he is truly a lover of art and a supporter of drama.</p>
<p>Recently, he has been working even harder to promote the performance of Shakespeare's plays in Chinese Mandarin. He has selected Shakespeare's masterpiece, The Merchant of Venice, and asked Mr. Gu Zhongyi to translate it. I don't want to say anything about this script and translation, I just want to talk about Ying Xian's efforts in directing this play. He has studied the costumes in the play - the costumes of the 16th century - and the customs of Venice at that time, even down to a pair of gloves and a candlestick. He does not want to be like the current Chinese stage plays, which rely only on fantasy and speculation to estimate the costumes and customs of people hundreds of years ago. He wants to do his volunteer work seriously and introduce Shakespeare's plays to us.</p>

<p>At the same time, he also wants to accurately introduce the customs and culture of Europe in the 16th century to us. This is truly something worthy of our attention, admiration, gratitude and praise. As for his directing methods, the strict selection of actors, and the precision of the scenery, it goes without saying. I boldly and arbitrarily say (This time he is bound to have a great success (May 1, at Shanghai University)</p>

<p>The Story of World Literature (161 by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi)</p>
<h3 id="e237">Chapter 41 German Literature After Goethe <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Now, let us look at the works of German poets and prose writers who have been recognized as having ability, with what deep consideration and what enthusiasm they are laboriously following the shining certainty - Goethe</p>
<p>Many literary, intellectual, and political motives in German literature urged the rise of the Romantic school and determined its nature. Germany, fragmented and powerless, lay at the feet of France. It was only natural that poets and idealists tended in their dreams to the medieval empire bearing the name of Germany. And this led them to Gothic and Catholic churches, to the architectural departments of Nuremberg, the cathedrals of Cologne and Strasbourg, to the love poets of the Old High German era, the monster-infested forests, and the folk songs and legends of rivers and valleys. Mixed with this motive was a philosophical motive. Thinkers born after Kant gradually purified the difficult world of reality, until Fichte declared that it was only a projection of the creative spirit of mankind. In this way, poets have the right to dream, only dream, depict that dream, and that is enough.</p>
<p>The Romantic school did not produce any solid artistic works. Thanks to Schlegel, Tieck, and others' translations of Shakespeare, and thanks to the linguistic labor of the Grimm brothers, it permanently enriched the world of knowledge. The articles are all fragments, mainly because the influence on European literature directly or indirectly is important. Only in terms of lyrical poetry did the Romanticists do first-class work. Novalis' (Fragments) become profound books, but these are only fragments. Hoffmann's stories are not listed as first-class literature. Novalis, Brentano, Eichendorff, Hölderlin, Uhland, and Rückert's lyrical poems are beautiful, and these poems, like Heine's lyrical poems, were composed by Schubert, Schumann, Franz, Brahms, etc. and were then known to the world.</p>
<p>Romantic lyric poetry has a long life, which is maintained in the sad tones of Nikolaus Lenau, and later in the lyric works of Eichendorff, which were made more famous by the composition of Hugo Wolf. This reached its highest point in the two or three flawless poems of Theodor Storm.</p>
<p>Three important figures emerged more or less directly from the Romantic school: Schopenhauer and two playwrights, both Prussians and Austrians, Heinrich von Kleist and Franz Grillparzer. Schopenhauer is famous as the classical interpreter of pessimism. He believes that the sum of the pain of life completely exceeds everything that is expected, equates the biological and spiritual will to live with evil, and declares asceticism and infatuation with art as the only ways of wisdom. The reason for adding him to this literary story is because not only his main work (The World as Will and Representation), but also all his small works, especially the two volumes of essays, are beautiful prose. He provided rich hints for literary linguistics and art music.</p>
<p>In his youth, the self-taught Kleist left behind a few plays and short stories, which gradually increased in value. He is modern. He abandoned the hackneyed tragic psychology and led us into the obscure inner struggles that take place in people's hearts. His (Prince of Homburg) is a beautiful comedy (The Broken Jug), and a few stories like (Michael Kohlhaas) belong to the earliest records in any literature. That is, the Austrian playwright Franz Grillparzer, the most famous, who, although often sickly, convincingly and exhaustively describes an unusually high degree of psychological situation, is far more of a poet and far less of a psychologist than Kleist. More precisely, he is also a Romanticist. His psychology is often close to modern people, but his plays, no matter where he chooses the background of the action, are always essentially human fairylands of plays. His political theory, like his motives, is poetry. Romantic asceticism struggles with high emotion in him, and the traces of that struggle appear in the treatment of all the allegories he constructs. He is not modern. He has no intelligence, but these beautiful, legendary, and brilliant plays - (Sappho) (Golden Fleece) (Dream is Also Life) (Libussa) (Love and the Waves of the Sea) - are bewitching things.</p>
<p>It has been pointed out that Romanticists are dreamers, conservatives, and often Catholics. Not long after the July Revolution broke out, freedom, which had been temporarily hidden since the Battle of Waterloo, redeveloped. A group of writers known as (Young Germany) appeared, who had a more realistic temperament and more liberal ideas. Few of them left immortal works. It is enough to mention the name of Ludwig Börne, the author of a magnificent pamphlet. We can immediately go on to talk about the Romanticists, and the sons of the revolution, the dreamers, and the realists, filled with hopes and enthusiasm for the freedom of mankind, singing the glory of the fairyland, and the misfortunes of the Silesian weavers who, like Hauptmann, made him immortal, the Jew and the German Heine. To talk about Heine, a figure who, until today, has been at the center of the storm of controversy in Germany, like a pendulum, with European influence, significance and fame.</p>
