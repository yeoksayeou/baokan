<h3>日政局新波瀾</h3>
<p>民政黨推定···</p>
<p>安達内相攝行總裁</p>
<p>首相仍由幣原代理</p>
<p>安達系少壯派表示反對</p>
<p>電通社九日東京電環繞浜口首相病狀之總理代理問題在與黨内惹起種種議論及策動甚至本届議會或招失敗亦未可知山本仙石若槻等長老對此問題曾經恊議一致主張超越一切形勢在浜口總理未全愈以前决以幣原代理總理收拾時局爲有利山本男六日赴興澤訪西園寺亦係對此事要求西園諒解但幣原本人有於議會開會前辭任之意故一面須勸幣原留任一面須由山本若槻兩氏向與黨要求諒解此自然以浜口首相不日全愈能出席議會爲前提若不出席届時再採適宜之處置總之此問題不日有具體的進展</p>
<p>電通社允日東京電本日定例閣議畢後安達内相與江木鐵相招致富田幹事長對於代理總理問題對付議會策共相恊議决定推安達内相代攝總理事務即請正在午餐之本黨出身閣員再齊集閣議室富田幹事長亦參加由安達内相江木鐵相起稱濱口總理爾後經過頗爲順調無煩杞憂惟全體復元尙須相當時日議會開會期日即在目前政府與與黨關係旣觸及政策問題自不能煩及幣原首相代理在濱口總理復元之前希望决定一中心人物以與與黨連絡並處理本黨政策惟選出二人以上恐致黨制紊亂而招誤會故擬選定一人不用副總裁及其他連絡部名稱實際執行總裁事務請發表意見次由安達江木富田三人合議决定安達内相掌管總裁事務各閣員亦無異議即予承認安達内相亦允就任明日將於帝國旅社開與黨及政府懇談會將於席上正式决定發表</p>
<p>電通社九日東京電山本達雄男若槻前總裁等民政黨長老欲以幣原代理臨時首相應付議會已見前電惟黨内安達系少壯派其他一部以幣原臨時代理總理係首相遭難後因純粹的事務的理由一種權宜處置若幣原於議會前辭職無留任之必要若浜口總理不能出席議會更無慰留之必要且以黨外大臣代理首相而應付議會實違反政黨政治之根本原則若浜口首相不能出席議會之事成爲確定的則徵詢黨内之意見决定由幣原代理首相到底亦無不可今長老等不問首相病勢如何徒欲以少事主義糊塗一時則爲不可故對此多持反對熊度恐有相當之波瀾云</p>
<p>電通社九日東京電安達内相茲已决定代掌管總裁事務故仍由幣原外相代理首相惟濱口首相若停會滿期後可能出席議院者幣原首相代理地位恐將發生變動故首相病狀經過爲各方面所注意</p>

<p>— 海客</p>
<p>少年（在一個大旅館的宴會中宴罷將出見侍者們雁行而立分拿着他的衣帽等候着）—看他們如此殷勤如伺候上客一様看來我這幾角錢的小帳是省不下的了</p>
<p>一侍者—先生這裏是你的外衣（助少年穿上少年結了他雙角票一張）</p>
<p>又一侍者—先生這裏是你的帽子（雙手遞與少年少年又給了他雙角票一張）又一侍者—先生這裏是你的手套（雙手遞與少年）</p>
<p>少年躊躇了半晌向他那雙敝舊的手套看了一眼）—這…這手套不是我的看來連兩角錢也不値還是你收下了吧</p>
<p>餐客（問侍者）—你們這様大的餐館甚麽菜都預備着的麽</p>

<h3>萬國競走之花花絮絮</h3>
<p>— 沈鎭潮</p>
<p>上海萬國競走爲程五十餘里循例每年一度今第十六次矣本届於七日之晨舉行之參加者計六國爲英愛法俄葡及我中華競賽者五十餘人結果我國周余愚諸君奮勇努力得個人及團體雙料錦標觀者色舞眉飛莫不欣欣得意也</p>
<p>大看台初次人滿　跑馬廳大看台觀大賽馬時人山人海此無足奇也而觀萬國競走如此濟濟實爲新紀錄蓋遙遙五十里之行程終點在大看台前衆均以一觀誰得錦標爲快</p>
<p>看競走犧牲熱被　競走於晨間八時起程至大看台爲終點最速者約在十時半以平日論此時正滬人好夢方回之際而七日恰又値星期欲一觀健兒身手於是不得不犧牲睡眠而早起矣淑女名媛亦復不少大半不及施脂粉留得美人眞面目在焉於此亦可見滬人士對於運動之熱忱矣</p>
<p>紅白旗臨風招展　看台前之草地爲競走之終點二旁鐵欄各挿以旗左則爲紅右則爲白直至馬霍路大門臨風招展紅白相映襯以未枯之綠草殊覺美麗也</p>
<p>名次牌預告行程　塲中樹黑牌賽員之行止隨時以汽車報告而於牌上揚之方將十時牌上書中國周余愚最先已及虹橋路衆爲大慰</p>
<p>脚踏車參加競賽　每一賽員均有一引進員或駕汽車或騎脚踏車此五十餘賽員乃隨有肢踏車無數蓋有知勝員心切者均以肢踏車追隨之此數十架脚踏車不啻亦加入競賽也</p>
<p>衆狂歡人影初見　馬霍路口接大看台有一洋台登之望威海衛路殊清晰衆乃據之威海衛路二旁人頭亦攢動甚擠將及十時半汽車接連而來衆知將至矣亦有先來報信者謂周余愚最先汽車去而大批脚踏車來矣於是益信無疑果然周君振其二手二足有如音樂節拍洋洋而來其後隨者約數百人洋台上迎者乃大聲歡呼周高舉雙手以答若云余必有以慰國人也</p>
<p>人上人爭看英雄　隨後吾國侯根仁君亦至個人而外吾國團體錦標十居六矣諸君努力果然揚眉吐氣榮膺冠軍觀衆歡呼有如雷動已而周君入給奬台受奬台被團團圍住水洩不通有上他人背者以覩周君究爲如何人而諸女士則擠於人叢中恐未得一見也及出復追隨之周君笑容滿面捧其纍纍奬品以歸</p>
<p>慶成功中西合奏　塲中特請有英軍葛林霍華斯隊之樂班軍樂助興給奬時軍樂悠揚慶我成功同時國人亦引吭狂歌中西合奏競賽中之美事也</p>
<p>祝努力老少英雄　全體五十餘賽員中有老有糼英人羅斯（個人參加）白髮蒼蒼恐年事甚高矣及至終點與另一少年仍努力爭競竟爲佔先深可欽佩而吾國龔錦濤君則僅十七齡此一對老少英雄吾人對之益將如何自勵哉</p>
<h3>汪榮二氏旅歐畫展何以空前？</h3>
<p>— 新擒</p>
<p>因其能竭盡藝術及一切附屬之巧思</p>
<p>昨爲汪亞塵榮君立二氏旅歐畫展之第二日記者專誠前往觀摩歷二小時因對於繪畫認識素淺不敢有所品評茲僅以個人管見所及略述一二藉以證明此會之何以空前想爲讀者所樂聞也</p>
<p>會場特别　會塲在中社俱樂部爲新建西式房屋中之表表者室内室外之佈置裝飾均極富麗堂皇三樓均滿佈名貴之繪畫集古今藝術之大成實爲勝任愉快此會塲不負此會此會亦不負此會塲也</p>
<p>佳作如林　汪氏素來繪畫均重切實非率爾操觚者可同日語而榮夫人適與汪爲同志以天成之佳耦聯袂旅歐北游合力同心搜羅歐西古今藝苑之珍奇歸以饗於國人琳琅滿目美不勝收謂之佳作誰曰不宜</p>
<p>鏡框出色　繪畫家有二事最費躊躇一爲畫框一爲製版而展覽會尤以畫框爲最要汪氏似有鑒於此故所用畫框一半似均由歐西携回聞一半則特托本市宏遠美術鑄金公司代製該公司爲名雕刻家張辰伯氏所創辦此次鏡框之出色張氏亦與有力焉</p>

<h3>將告結束中之釐拆寂象</h3>

<h3>别開生面的汽車夫宣誓</h3>
<p>— 志政</p>
<p>克來夫蘭組安全設計委員會　製定十項信條須駕車人宣誓　别出心裁汽車肇禍果然减少</p>
<p>在目前許多汽車問題之中没有再比汽車肇禍再嚴重了各國工程專家從機械方面去研究怎様能减少危險市政專家從市政方面去設法限制車輛行駛過速這些以及其他報章所刋載的論文眞是不知凡幾洋洋大觀即如本刋前次所載「全球道路恊會解决汽車肇禍問題而論也可稱得費盡心機處處顧到然而事實上雖法令森嚴而肇禍問題反與日俱增上海一埠十一個月達一萬餘起是何等的駭人聽聞汽車肇禍旣是這般嚴重而各人想出來的方法更是奇妙百出最近美國克來夫蘭市政府爲了要解决汽車肇禍問題特地組織了一個安全設計委員會委員會所設的什麽計劃呢說來眞也有趣便是擬定了信條十項要各汽車夫一一簽字服從宣誓遵守這十條信條都是防禦汽車肇禍的重要條件由各汽車夫宣誓以後存入委員會保管據說這様一來汽車肇禍果然减少多多了這十項宣誓信條分列如後</p>
<p>（一）當我駕車的時候我祇作爲世界上一半的人是聾子瞎子他們的安全都要我來維護的—這條信條是什麽意見呢就是矯正目前汽車駕駛人的燥急在行車的時候他們目定一切的開足馬力或者明明看見前面有許多人然而心裏總以爲他們必定要讓的所以還不肯减低速率從容前去現在呌他們以爲世界上的人一半是聾子瞎子駕車人自然要格外當心了</p>
<p>（二）我在駕駛的時候必特别注意如遇危險立即停車—這條看來很簡單然而也有深意因爲現在一般車夫多不能聚精會神來當心他們暗車輛等到危險碰到了自然來不及煞車而肇禍也因此發生無從補救了倘使個個汽車夫能專心一致來開車遇有危險就立即停車肇禍問題自可隨之解决</p>
<p>（三）我誓願尊崇其他駕駛人及行人之權利並服從道路法—汽車夫的最大弊病在乎目空一切以爲惟有他是最尊榮的於是對於行路的人就不放心裏對於其他駕駛人也毫無禮貎肇禍也因之而起所以美國現在提倡「道路謙讓」（RoadCourtesy）正是此意能謙讓一切問題都可以解决</p>
<p>（四）在交乂路口學校及其他須特别留心區域我必將速率减低以便隨時停車—交乂路口是最容易肇禍的所在尤其在繁盛地方汽車互撞的事更是層出不窮原因無非是不肯將速率降减任情駛去結果等到遇到了一時却避讓不及所以在這種地方更十二分的小心</p>
<p>（五）我誓不視汽車爲游戲品—汽車肇禍的主因在乎汽車夫的不願愼重將事他們多目汽車爲游戲品兜圈子呀登山呀以爲是一種玩意兒如此又那得不肇禍呢所以要補救這一層要駕駛人自已宣誓不再拿汽車當做兒戲</p>
<p>（六）我在停車或轉彎時必先打燈—汽車信號本來是極簡單的他祇有後面的紅燈最關重要然而僅僅一個紅燈偏偏許多駕駛人把它大意過去停車和轉彎最關重要如果不打紅燈即不能知照後面的車輛相撞便在所難免了</p>
<p>（七）我行車必靠路右服從警察指揮—歐美各國·行車都是靠右邊的中國却是靠左邊的右邊左邊都不是問題惟有服從纔是最切要的在大都市裏右手律還可以行得通一到鄉村汽車便完全自由行動不再顧到什麽左右了所以肇禍最利害的不是大街市而是冷僻公路理由便是如此服從警中察指揮更屬重要否則便完全陷於無秩序了</p>
<p>（八）在天氣不良時我必特别愼重駕駛—不必說其他吧單是霧天便夠受了一切東西都變成糢糊兩面汽車對駛一個不小心立刻相撞其餘如下雪天氣也是如此</p>
<p>（九）我誓遵行車法令—行車法令雖不能說完全免去肇禍然而如果認眞服從他終也可以得到相當效力我們考察汽車肇禍的原因違背行車法令也是一個重要成分所以汽車如果能恪遵行車法令可說是對症發的良藥</p>
<p>（十）在退車時我必先看清後方—因倒車而肇禍的也不在少數大部分是在退車以前没有看清後面有無行人和車輛結果人家但注意前面來的車輛却不疑心後面又在退車所以這件事看看狠小影響却是狽大</p>
<p>從上面看來克來夫蘭安全設計委員會所擬定的十條信條雖也異常簡單然而從前的法令規章在汽車夫是看來不生興趣的現在由汽車夫自已宣誓遵照却由被動一變而爲自動其效用當然與視爲漠不相關者不同了</p>
<h3>世界汽車與人口比率</h3>
<p>— 霖</p>
<p>現有汽車三千五萬輛　每五十五人合得一車</p>
<p>據美國商務部之調查一千九百二十九年中全世界所有之汽車其數已超過三五·○○○·○○○輛調查中所包括者有一百五十七國之多屬地及領士亦概括在内全世界所註册之客車運貨車及公共汽車其數共計三五·一二七·三八九輛較之一九二九年開始時增加三·零九二·八二六輛或百分之九是也全球各國道路上之汽車日有增加一九二二年時统計爲一二·五三零·四一六輛至一九二九年即增加至百分之一百五十五焉</p>
<p>一千九百三十年開始時以全世界人口一·九四九·零零零·零零零算則每五十五人合得汽車一輛一九二九年時其數爲六十一人合得汽車一輛若在美國據最近之統計每四個半人可得汽車一輛一年之前則每四·八七人合得一輛汽車除美國外其他各國每二百十六人得一輛汽車若在一九二九年之開始則須二百四十七人合得汽車一輛焉</p>
<p>加拿大與紐絲倫汽車與人口之比率較美國略遜一籌而屈居第二位即每八個人可得汽車一輛是也澳大利亞居第三位每十人合得汽車一輛摩納哥第四每十六人得汽車一輛若阿拉伯西南部之也門其地須十萬零四千一百六十六人始得汽車一輛愛亞屋皮亞每一萬七千七百八十一人得汽車一輛阿富汗每一萬七千七百七十八人得汽車一輛上述最近之統計凡東西南阿菲利加洲中國波斯叙利亞日暹羅等均見增加其他較小各國近之汽車銷售機會亦視前略多矣</p>
<p>以最近之汽車統計而言各種式様之汽車在大陸合衆國登計者數達二六·六五三·四五○輛亦即較外國多增三位是也單以美國而論其客車登計數佔全世界總數百分之七十八商業用車佔全數百分之六十二法國居總數最多之第二位再次爲英吉利與加拿大世界有汽車各國中阿拉伯西南部土屬奥曼及不列顚領島百慕大兩地其汽車登計數祇有十起因而殿軍焉</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>全世界之商業用汽車其登計之數目較之客車爲多一九二九年中全世界之客車註册增加二·五四○五一一輛或百分之九·四運貨車及公共汽車增加五五二·三一五輛或百分之十·九故客車之數較之一九二八年增加數之百分之七·三爲又增運貨車及公共汽車則减去百分之○·一也</p>
<p>客車之數在大多數國家内較運貨汽車爲多然有數國家則商業上用之汽車其數實超過坐用者且此種商用汽車又能開闢荒僻之區向爲客車運用之先導也一千九百二十九年時美國之汽車註册數增加二·○二六五二七輛或百分之八·二强其前一年之增加數爲一·三六七·七三八輛或百分之五·九美合衆國外一九二九年之汽車增加數爲一·○六九·二九七輛或百分之十四四○一九二八年則爲九七三三四七輛或百分之一五·一是也</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Political Instability in Countries Worldwide</h3>
<p>The underlying cause of political instability in countries worldwide stems from economic instability. While unique circumstances in each country contribute, if economic conditions were thriving as in the past, these unique relationships would not be as disruptive.</p>
<p>Revolutions in South American nations arise entirely from economic factors, as is widely recognized. Unemployment poses the most daunting challenge for political figures in powerful nations, a problem seemingly insurmountable. Opposition parties exploit this issue to attack and even overthrow governments, driven by economic hardship. Even within governing parties, dissent often arises due to rising unemployment and economic stagnation. Viewed collectively, worldwide unrest, political instability in nations, and internal turmoil within political parties are all rooted in global economic instability. Economic instability leads to difficulties for industries, individuals, and businesses, making populations susceptible to demagoguery. Economic instability, therefore, is the root cause of widespread unrest.</p>
<p>However, given the present global conditions, escalating industrial competition, and the irreversible depreciation of silver, achieving economic stability in the short term is no easy task.</p>

<p>British Foreign Secretary Reads Russian Reply</p>
<p>Chamberlain Believes it Conflicts with Dignity</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Moscow, 8th – Following the Supreme Court's verdict on the eight defendants in the industrial sabotage case, a petition for amnesty was submitted to the government. This afternoon, the Central Executive Committee resolved, out of consideration for the defendants' repentance and honest confession, to commute the original death sentences of Lai Muxun and four others to ten years of imprisonment with forced labor, followed by deprivation of civil rights for five years and confiscation of property. The sentences of Wu Qijin and two others, originally sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, were reduced to eight years of imprisonment with forced labor, followed by deprivation of civil rights for five years and confiscation of property. Reuters, Moscow, 8th – The Russian Central Executive Committee has pardoned Lai Muxun and the other five defendants in the treason case, commuting their death sentences to ten years of imprisonment. The sentences of others, originally sentenced to ten years of imprisonment, have been reduced to eight years.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th – British Foreign Secretary Henderson, during questioning in the House of Commons today, read Russia's reply regarding Britain's inquiry into anti-British rhetoric during the trial of the Moscow treason case. The reply stated that the investigators or the court could not strip the defendants of the right to confess everything. The prosecutor naturally presents a public case based on the confession. However, the court and prosecutor simply did not pay attention to aspects involving Britain, and the prosecutor did not elaborate on this point in his final remarks. Furthermore, the Russian government has never, in any place, expressed its opinion on this matter. Conservative Party member Chamberlain stated that if this matter were to proceed in this manner, it would conflict with British interests and dignity. Henderson replied that he had just received this reply and had not yet had the chance to consider it.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 8th – British Foreign Secretary Henderson today read in the House of Commons Russia's reply regarding Britain's inquiry into the Moscow broadcast of a radio message propagating subversion in Britain. It was claimed that this message was broadcast by a trade union radio station, and the Soviet Russian government had no censorship personnel stationed at this radio station. Therefore, it cannot be viewed as Russia violating its obligations. Furthermore, this message merely stated the Soviet Russian viewpoint. However, regarding the British Foreign Secretary's statement that such messages were highly inappropriate, the trade union administrative council will certainly pay attention to this in the future.</p>
<h3>New Waves in Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>The Minseito Party Estimates...</p>
<p>Interior Minister Adachi Acting as President</p>
<p>The Prime Minister Still Represented by Shidehara</p>
<p>Young Turks of the Adachi Faction Express Opposition</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Discussions and maneuvers surrounding the Prime Minister's representative problem, due to Prime Minister Hamaguchi's illness, have stirred up various debates within the party, and it is even possible that the current Diet session may face failure. Elders such as Yamamoto, Sengoku, and Wakatsuki have consulted on this issue and unanimously advocate that, transcending all circumstances, it would be advantageous for Shidehara to act as Prime Minister and manage the current situation until Prime Minister Hamaguchi fully recovers. Yamamoto visited Saionji in Okitsui on the 6th, also seeking Saionji's understanding on this matter. However, Shidehara himself intends to resign before the Diet session opens. Therefore, on one hand, it is necessary to persuade Shidehara to stay, and on the other hand, Yamamoto and Wakatsuki must seek understanding from the party. Naturally, this is based on the premise that Prime Minister Hamaguchi will fully recover and be able to attend the Diet session soon. If he does not attend, appropriate measures will be taken at that time. In summary, there will be concrete progress on this issue soon.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Following today's routine cabinet meeting, Interior Minister Adachi and Minister of Railways Eki summoned Secretary-General Tomita to discuss countermeasures for the Diet regarding the acting prime minister problem. It was decided that Interior Minister Adachi would act as prime minister. Immediately, cabinet members from the party who were having lunch were summoned back to the cabinet meeting room, and Secretary-General Tomita also participated. Interior Minister Adachi and Minister of Railways Eki stated that Prime Minister Hamaguchi's recovery was progressing smoothly and there was no need to worry. However, full recovery still requires a considerable amount of time. The Diet session is imminent, and the relationship between the government and the party has touched on policy issues. Therefore, it is not possible to trouble Prime Minister Shidehara to act. Before Prime Minister Hamaguchi recovers, it is hoped that a central figure will be determined to liaise with the party and handle party policies. However, selecting more than two people would cause disorder in the party system and lead to misunderstandings. Therefore, it is proposed to select one person without using the titles of Deputy President or other liaison departments to actually execute the duties of president. Please express your opinions. Next, Interior Minister Adachi, Minister of Railways Eki, and Secretary-General Tomita jointly decided that Interior Minister Adachi would manage the affairs of the president. All cabinet members had no objections and approved it. Interior Minister Adachi also agreed to take office. Tomorrow, a meeting between the party and the government will be held at the Imperial Hotel, where it will be formally decided and announced.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Elders of the Minseito Party, such as Tatsuo Yamamoto and former President Wakatsuki, want Shidehara to act as temporary prime minister to deal with the Diet. However, young Turks of the Adachi faction and others believe that Shidehara acting as temporary prime minister is a purely expedient measure due to the Prime Minister's distress. If Shidehara resigns before the Diet session, there is no need for him to stay. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi cannot attend the Diet session, there is even less reason to retain him. Furthermore, having a minister from outside the party act as prime minister to deal with the Diet violates the fundamental principles of party politics. If it becomes certain that Prime Minister Hamaguchi cannot attend the Diet session, then the opinions of the party should be sought to decide whether Shidehara should act as prime minister until the end. However, the elders are only trying to muddle through the situation temporarily with a policy of minimizing trouble, regardless of the Prime Minister's illness, which is unacceptable. Therefore, they hold a strongly opposing attitude, and there are fears of considerable turbulence.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th – Interior Minister Adachi has now decided to manage the affairs of the president, so Foreign Minister Shidehara will continue to act as prime minister. However, if Prime Minister Hamaguchi can attend the Diet after the recess, Foreign Minister Shidehara's position as acting prime minister may change. Therefore, the Prime Minister's illness is being closely watched by all sides.</p>

<h3>Poisonous Fog Spreads</h3>
<p>Reaches Liège Area in Meuse Valley</p>
<p>Hospitalized Patients Reach Four Hundred</p>
<p>England and France Also Have Similar Patients</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Brussels, 8th – The poisonous fog in the Meuse Valley has spread to the Liège area. Currently, the number of patients suffering from this disease in hospitals has reached four hundred, and people are still being sent in daily. Patients from villages such as Einci and Flémalle are the most numerous. The authorities have ordered that corpses do not need to be examined and should be buried quickly. Radical newspapers mostly claim that the poisonous fog is certainly due to the accidental leakage of military poison gas, which was obstructed by the fog, causing it to condense and not dissipate. The authorities are well aware of the cause and are secretly investigating. The party will propose a motion in Parliament asking the government to thoroughly investigate.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 8th – Two workers in the suburbs of Puteaux have also suddenly died, and their symptoms are quite similar to those of people who died from the poisonous fog in the Meuse Valley in Belgium.

<p>Radical Socialist Party Unwilling to Cooperate</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 8th – Barthou declared that he has stopped forming a cabinet because the Radical Socialist Party is unwilling to cooperate. Political circles regret Barthou's failure, saying that the Radical Socialist Party's unwillingness to join is likely because they do not want to be in the cabinet with Thieudeau and someone from the Maraud group. Currently, the prominent figures in the French political scene who have the qualifications to form a cabinet are not more than four: Sarraut, Le Fevre, Briand, and Steeg of the Radical Party. Steeg, former Governor-General of Algeria, has served as a cabinet member eight times since 1915.</p>

<h3>Careless Ship Bombing Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>Reuters, Lorient, 7th – The former British India Steam Navigation Company ship "Egypt," carrying hundreds of gold and silver bars, sank off the coast of France on May 20, 1922, after colliding with another ship. This year, the famous Italian salvage ship "Artiglio" was in charge of the salvage operation to retrieve the gold and silver from the ship. After working for a long time, it was found that two ships sunk during the war were blocking the Quiberon Bay Strait. The salvage team wanted to bomb them away. At 4:00 PM today, the ship bombing operation was carried out, but one of the ships, named "Florence," was carrying hundreds of tons of explosives. The swimmers were unaware of this and dropped explosives to bomb it. As a result, all the original explosives on the ship detonated, and the salvage ship "Artiglio," which was anchored two hundred yards away, was bombed and sank. All the crew members were Italian. About fourteen people are dead. Seven survivors have been rescued and are now in the Belle-Île hospital.</p>

They rushed to the riverfront pier of the San Bei Company at dawn on the 7th to welcome Chairman Chiang. The warship approached the pontoon at 9:45 AM. All Chinese and foreign warships stationed in Xunyang raised flags and fired twenty-one-gun salutes to pay respects. Representatives from all sectors of Jiujiang party, government, military, and civilian, numbering about a thousand, stood on the riverbank to welcome him. When the warship docked, the welcomers removed their hats and saluted. Military music played in unison. Along the river, guards and police stood in solemn salute. Chairman Chiang dispatched Secretary-General Shao Lizi and Director of the Political Training Department Zhou Fohai to go to the deck to thank the welcomers. He then summoned Chairman Lu, party and government committee members, and the High Court President. The security in Xunyang that day was extremely tight. Military police and sentries were densely deployed along the route from the riverfront pier to the train station. The Fifth Division, the Second Anti-Smuggling Regiment, and the Jiujiang Public Security Bureau's police team were responsible for different sections. In addition to sending the Chu You warship stationed in Hukou to escort the convoy, the Navy Department also dispatched the Minquan warship from Hankou on the evening of the 6th, led by Zeng Yiding, commander of the naval torpedo squadron, to Xunyang to assist the original Chu Qian warship in guarding the river.

<h3>News Highlights</h3>
<p>The following is a record of Chairman Chiang's meeting with party and government members. (1) Regarding party affairs: (1) Chairman Chiang asked if the organization of the lower-level party branches in Jiangxi was sound. Answer (Representative of the Provincial Party Branch Member Liu Zuozhou): Previously, the organization of party branches in more than ten counties in Jiangxi was quite unsound. After a period of reorganization, it is now sound. (2) Asked how the mass organizations in each county were. Answer: The Provincial Party Branch has formulated a plan for the mass organizations in each county, and three commissioners will be dispatched by the Provincial Party Branch to tour the counties and guide the party branches in each county to carry out the organization. (3) Asked how the Provincial Party Branch is currently working. Answer: Because three of the executive committee members have gone on tour, only three commissioners remain in the province, so the standing committee meeting has not been held. (4) Asked if party affairs in Ji'an have now been restored and how the mass movement is progressing. Answer: The county party branch commissioners in Ji'an were killed by bandits during the previous fall, and many staff members have fled Ji'an to avoid the bandits. Recently, after Ji'an was recovered, the Provincial Party Branch dispatched Commissioner Yin Jingrang to lead the county party affairs staff back to Ji'an to restore work. Because the degree of banditization of the Ji'an masses is relatively deep, the current party affairs work focuses on awakening the banditized masses, leading the masses to assist the army in clearing bandits, and organizing anti-communist groups and watch teams, etc. (2) Regarding political affairs: (1) Education Director Jiang Ji reported on the educational situation in the province, briefly stating that the education funds in the province have been affected by banditry, and the monthly funds are only set at 80,000 yuan, which is not enough to cover expenses, and education is on the verge of stagnation. He requested Chairman Chiang to maintain the original independence of the education fund, etc. Chairman Chiang nodded in agreement. (2) Finance Director Huang Bozhong reported on the financial situation in the province, briefly stating that the current financial difficulties in the province are beyond description. All expenditures are made by borrowing debts. In addition, at the present time, a large-scale bandit suppression is underway, and the funds for bandit suppression are still unsettled. He requested that Chairman Chiang not only allocate funds from the central government for subsidies, but also approve the central government to return to the province 3 million yuan of temporary exchange coupons exchanged in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, and 3 million yuan for bandit suppression expenses and military rations that were advanced. Chiang replied, "Okay." (3) Liang Renjie, President of the High Court, reported on the judicial situation in the province. (4) Hu Jue, Chief Prosecutor of the High Court, reported on the disaster situation in Ji'an caused by bandits and requested the following three points: (A) Set a deadline for the army to thoroughly eliminate the bandits and communists in the province. (B) Clarify officialdom and punish corrupt officials. (C) Please allocate funds from the central government to relieve the victims of the disaster. (3)</p>
<p>Regarding military affairs: (1) Chairman Lu, who is also the commander-in-chief of the Ninth Route Army, reported on the progress of bandit suppression and the changes in the bandit situation. (2) Deputy Division Commander Yue of the 50th Division reported on the bandit suppression progress of the division and the current stationed location. Finally, Chairman Chiang met with the British and Japanese consuls stationed in Xunyang.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang rested on the warship for a while. At 10:45 AM, he landed with He Chengjun, Shao Lizi, Zhou Fo Hai, and others. Amidst the military music and cheers of welcoming personnel, he rode in three cars with Chairman Lu and others directly to the station. All circles in Jiujiang originally planned to hold a welcoming meeting at Tongwen School and invite Chairman Chiang to attend and give a speech. Later, upon hearing that Chairman Chiang would not stay in Xunyang for a moment, they transferred from the riverfront to the station to see Chairman Chiang off. At 10:50 AM, he arrived at the station and boarded the special train, which was attached with thirteen first- and second-class carriages for the staff and welcoming personnel from the province to Xunyang to ride. The special train departed at 11:00 AM. The road-roller car departed at 10:00 AM, and the railway bureau telegraphed the troops along the road to pay attention to vigilance.</p>
<p>Situation upon arrival in Nanchang. Nanchang correspondent: Chairman Chiang's special train arrived at Niuhang Station at 3:15 PM on the afternoon of the 7th. At 3:30 PM, he crossed the river to the Provincial Library to stay. On that day, leaders and representatives of various institutions and organizations in Nanchang went to Zhangwai River in the morning starting at 6:00 AM to welcome him. They arrived one after another at noon. Zhu Shaoliang, commander-in-chief of the Sixth Route Army, Xiong Yanglin of the provincial government, the three provincial committees, and Mayor Gong and Zhang, the director of the Public Security Bureau, crossed the river to Niuhang Station to greet him. As for security matters, the 5th Division and the Independent 14th Brigade were stationed along the Nanxun Road. From Niuhang Station to the pontoon bridge across the Zhang River to the crossing point, the National Government Guard Regiment and a part of the 14th Brigade were on guard. From Yanjiang Road through Zhongshan Road to reach Baihuazhou, the 1st and 2nd Regiments of the Security Forces and the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Squads of the Provincial Public Security Bureau Security Team were on guard. The road was cleared at around 10:00 AM, and those without welcome passes and symbols were not allowed to pass. When Chiang's special car started from Xunyang, the 9th Route Army also sent two Ke Sai planes to fly along the Nanxun Road and circle in the air to escort it. The strictness can be imagined.</p>
<p>When Chairman Chiang arrived at Niuhang Station, the military band played loudly. Zhu Shaoliang and others boarded the train to welcome him. Chiang got off the train and shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Together they boarded the American wheel to cross the river. When the wheel from the Road Bureau stopped at the landing point, a 21-gun salute was fired, the military music was melodious, the military police raised their guns, and the welcomers took off their hats to salute. After Chiang landed, he took off his hat to salute the welcoming crowds along the river. Then Chiang and his entourage took more than ten cars directly to the Provincial Library in Baihuazhou to stay. Lu Dipin and Zhu Shaoliang followed to pay their respects. It was heard that Chiang immediately convened a military conference at the province with He Chengjun and the two commanders-in-chief Lu and Zhu to discuss the specific plans for suppressing bandits in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Fujian. It was also heard that Chiang, deeply moved by the devastation of western Jiangxi by the communists, decided to go to Ji'an with Commander Lu in the next few days to inspect and convene the division commanders Zhang, Tan, Xu, Deng, Gong, Luo, Chiang, and Cai to hold a military conference to discuss detailed methods of suppressing bandits in order to eliminate the bandits and communists within a time limit.

<h3>Preparations for Welcoming Chiang in Wuhan</h3>
<p>Chiang scheduled to come to Wuhan on the 11th</p>
<p>Hankou correspondent: Commander-in-Chief Chiang took the Yong Sui warship west from Beijing on the 5th of this month and arrived in Xunyang on the 6th. After receiving the telegram, He Chengjun, head of the local headquarters, took the Chu Tai warship to Xunyang on the 6th to greet him. When he met with Commander-in-Chief Chiang on the 7th, Commander-in-Chief Chiang, along with his staff, He Chengjun, Lu Dipin, and others, departed from Xunyang. At noon, they arrived in Nanchang. Chiang, feeling that the bandit disaster in Jiangxi Province was more severe, specifically decided to convene a military conference in Nanchang on the 9th to discuss ways to eliminate the bandits in Jiangxi. He would return to Xunyang on the 11th and then transfer to Wuhan. He Chengjun planned to fly to Wuhan by plane on the 10th to make all the arrangements. All circles here have decided to hold a grand welcome when Chiang comes to suppress the bandits. The welcoming preparatory committee had previously issued many welcome badges. Recently, in order to be particularly cautious, it has published a notice in the newspaper to cancel the previously issued welcome badges and issue new ones by the Garrison Command. The Garrison Command has also re-specified the security and welcome methods, including: (1) Land security is the responsibility of the Wuhan Garrison Command's various martial law units, but the security area is divided into special security and general security. One, special security is from the landing dock of the Commander-in-Chief directly to the headquarters. Two, each branch road directly to the headquarters is a general security area. (2) The symbols for welcoming personnel are divided into special and general. One, special symbols are issued to military officers above the rank of major general and civil officials above the rank of senior official to pass through the special security line. Two, general symbols are issued to representatives of various agencies and organizations to pass outside the special security line. (3) The Wuhan Garrison Command will send personnel to strictly investigate and verify the symbols. One, investigate the security forces inside and outside the security area. Two, personnel or representatives wearing welcome symbols must clearly indicate their rank and name on the registration book before they can pass. Three, welcoming personnel or representatives wearing general symbols must not enter or leave the security line without authorization. Four, the registration book is set up at the main intersection of the general security line, and the symbol will be issued after registration. As for the fact that the road from the riverbank to the headquarters passes through the Japanese and French concessions, the municipal government has also contacted them and reached an agreement. On the one hand, our country's armed soldiers will enter the border to guard, and on the other hand, the concession authorities will still add posts to protect. It can also be seen that it is very strict.</p>
<p>As for the bandit suppression in Hubei Province, it has become more tense because Chiang came to Wuhan. The bandit communists in Huanggangkou, eastern Hubei, have been ordered by the headquarters to be eliminated by Guo Rudong and other troops within three days. Because the bandits have occupied the area for several months, all passing ships have been vigilant. If the bandit communists in this area are eliminated, the bandit nests in eastern Hubei will be breached. Secondly, Huang'an has been personally attacked by Xu Yuanquan and Xiao Zhichu, who have repeatedly defeated the bandit army. Xiao sent two telegrams to the headquarters on the 8th to report the victory. The text of the telegrams is as follows: (Telegram 1) (1) This division entered the Baliwan, 60 miles south of Huang'an today. (2) Wang Brigade advanced from Zhonghekou to the Daxiaojinshan area today and fought fiercely with more than a thousand communist bandits for a day, annihilating many bandits. (3) Xin Brigade is advancing from Changxianling to Shizidian Yaojiaji. (4) After Chen Brigade is transferred from Xin'an Baliwan, our division will use all its strength to attack Huang'an. Special report. (Telegram 2) 1. Zhang Shi's regiment of our Wang Brigade has driven away the Red Guards in Bancangdian Lijiawan Donglinpu and other places and is now occupying Kougongdian and other places, attacking Shen Changqian's bandits, who number about a thousand. Two. Chen Brigade Yu regiment has captured Dujialiangting and continued to search and suppress Gaopogang. Three. Xin Brigade Yang Xin regiment has retreated the Red Guards of Tal Mountain and continued to attack Shizidian. Li Yinshen regiment is advancing from Changxianling to Yaojiaji. Special report. (December 8th)</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Revolutionary Donation Investigation and Award Bureau</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese have donated a large amount of money to support the revolution of the motherland in the past. It is urgent to investigate and reward them to show their recognition. The central government previously accepted the suggestion of He Zhongying, the representative of the Singapore Tongde Newspaper, and handed over the investigation and awarding of this donation to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Later, it formulated four types of regulations, including the Regulations on the Investigation and Award of Overseas Chinese Revolutionary Donations, the Award Regulations, the Registration Rules, and the Bureau Regulations, and handed them over to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for investigation and implementation. The association believed that the procedures for investigating and awarding this donation were very complicated, and that it would not be thorough unless a bureau was specifically set up to handle it. Therefore, according to Article 8 of the Regulations on the Investigation and Award of Overseas Chinese Revolutionary Donations, it established an Overseas Chinese Revolutionary Donation Investigation and Award Bureau under the association to be solely responsible for its affairs. The staff members were also transferred from the association's original staff to be responsible for the handling. It was officially established on the 1st of this month. The registration forms for the donation will be sent to the party branches, newspapers, and other overseas Chinese organizations that have historical relations with the Kuomintang in various places overseas to start the investigation for review and award separately.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Provincial Government Decides to Set Up Police in Japanese Permanent Lease Land</h3>
<p>Shenyang correspondent: The Liaoning Ning Provincial Government previously received a report from the Commercial Port Public Security Bureau stating that there were several permanent lease lands in the boundary, including Inoue Nobuo, Hirano Masaaki, Kamata Yasuke, and the 12 Biaochun sections, covering a large area. In the past, due to special circumstances or unresolved negotiations, police stations had not been added to all these lands. According to the port regulations, although the land is permanently leased by the Japanese, sovereignty belongs to our country, and police posts should be established as soon as possible to maintain law and order and prevent guests from taking over the host. It requested the Provincial Public Security Bureau to make proper arrangements to maintain sovereignty. The provincial government ordered the special commissioner for foreign affairs to review it. Then, according to the reply, the commercial port area of the provincial capital is a self-opened commercial port. Although foreigners are allowed to lease it permanently, sovereignty is entirely ours. The original report listed the large sections of permanent lease land of Japanese Inoue Nobuo, Hirano Masaaki, Kamata Yasuke, and 12 Biaochun. Except for the 12 Biaochun, which has been negotiated and our country has set up posts, the relevant bureaus and volumes have been consulted in other places, and the clauses signed with the Japanese Hirano and Kamata, etc., stipulate that public land, police stations, etc. are all reserved for use by the bureau, so there is no problem. The Inoue Nobuo item is for Sun Huichuan to change his name to receive the tenant. Although no other clauses have been signed, it must comply with the port regulations and should be handled in the same way. Although most of the land is currently undeveloped and relatively empty, it is beneficial to prevent thieves and is of great benefit to the ground. After receiving the report, the provincial government has now ordered Bai Mingzhen, director of the Provincial Public Security Bureau, to set up police stations in each of these places as soon as possible.

<p>Local Correspondences</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>After interrogating the Tinglin communist prisoners, it was found that Pu'nan Hougang Mapengdianshan and other places were all places where the Songjin connection was active as communists. They often gathered openly for meetings at night as a common practice. Although the local people heard about it, they did not dare to report it. Yesterday, when the county police team was stationed in Hougang, they captured an important element sent from another place to work there. The county government dispatched Political Police Chief Dong Futang to Tinglin to bring him back. The county government committee member Du interrogated the prisoner, who confessed that his name was Gu Zhigao from Chongming Yilongzhen. He used to be a partner in the Shenshengnan Goods Store in Shanghai Baxianqiao. He was laid off in May. This time, he went to Lvgang to visit a friend. On the train, he met another friend who sent him a rattan basket. He didn't meet his friend and was arrested on the way back. The confession was cunning. The interrogating officer ordered him to be detained. It was heard that the list of party members stored in the rattan basket included several people living in Tinglin Town, such as Yang. By the time they went to search, they had all fled upon hearing the news. Speakers said that the bandit was not without status in the party there.</p>
<p>The Education Bureau added a People's Education Center. The Education Bureau believes that popular education is a priority during the period of political tutelage. A popular education center has been established in Tinglin and has been quite successful. Fengjing is also an important town in the county and it is necessary to establish a People's Education Center. The Bureau Affairs Meeting has decided to add one in Fengjing and has ordered Shen Fuyun, the principal of the Third Elementary School, to prepare.</p>
<p>Inspector Zheng handed over his duties and left office. Zheng Han, the inspector of the Sixth Sub-Station in Sijing, is a native of Fengjing. He has served in the area for seven years and has a very good relationship with the local people. This time, after receiving the news that he was transferred back for use, they unanimously submitted a request to retain him. However, Inspector Zheng was determined to break away because of his lack of energy and decided to transfer the official seals, public property, and documents to the successor before waiting for approval, and scheduled to hire a boat to return to Feng on the 9th of this month.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Continued interrogation of the Sun Jingqing conflict with the saltworks. Sun Jingqing, the education committee member of the Second District of this county, had a conflict with the Xiassha Saltworks Office for taking Tandan on behalf of others. It is now known that Sun did not appear in court on the 20th of last month because the case was due to be heard, because he hoped that someone would mediate or settle the matter, so he filed a request for an extension. A certain important person at sea did write to the saltworks at that time, requesting a peaceful resolution, but the saltworks did not show any willingness to accommodate, so the matter has been delayed until now. Yesterday was the date for the continued summons for interrogation. Sun arrived in court and Lu, the trial officer, briefly interrogated him for a few words, and also instructed Sun to quickly ask someone to mediate and settle the matter, otherwise he would only have to deal with it according to law. The Provincial Education Department also insisted on handling the case according to law. The county government received this order yesterday, ordering them to comply immediately.</p>
<p>The president of the public hospital was replaced. Zhang Jianqian, the president of the First Public Hospital of this county, recently repeatedly submitted a request to the county government to resign because he was not familiar with medical skills and was deeply afraid of delaying hospital affairs. The board of directors of the hospital held a meeting yesterday and decided to hire Western doctor Lin Yuqing as the president. They have submitted a request to the county government for approval.</p>

<p>The two branches of the Jianyuan temple, one for renovation and one for construction. After the Fenggao Court sent personnel to order the renovation of the Jianyuan temple in this county, the county union organized the Jianyuan Temple Fundraising Committee to handle the matter in Fengcheng. The people from all circles in the west of the township believed that the old prison in Fengcheng was dilapidated and unsuitable, and that the Yue sacrifices had been dangerous many times. Therefore, they advocated building a new prison in Nanhqiao, where the county seat is located, in order to make it complete. Jiang Rongchu, the chief of the First, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth districts, was appointed to prepare reasons to telegraph the High Court, ordering the county to stop the renovation and allow the people to automatically raise 12,000 yuan to start construction as soon as possible. Subsequently, they were approved to submit a report stating that building a new prison in the county seat was a good idea, but whether the funds had been settled and how the project would be carried out should be reported in detail before approval could be given. The people in the east of the township heard this news and rose up in opposition, and Chen Daiji, a member of the renovation fundraising committee, sent a letter to the High Court asking Shi Zechen, the original investigator, for instructions. Their reason was that Feng county was narrow and long, and the distance between east and west was extremely far. The east of the township relied on this judicial organ to suppress it. Once it moved to the west, the security would be worrying. In addition, the people's livelihood was declining, and considering the situation and reason, renovation was the most economical. It is now known that the committee has submitted the case to the High Court, which ordered the county to check the county on the 4th. The fundraising renovation of the prisons in the county was based on the expansion of the existing old prisons in the city and there was no order to build a new prison in the county seat. It was a misunderstanding that they should immediately order the county chief to work with the fundraising committee to report the fundraising results in detail along with the engineering estimate of the construction factory, and start work on the appointed day so that the success could be observed as soon as possible. The districts should not use excuses to delay prison administration. Therefore, the committee officially recruited workers to undertake the construction yesterday, and the money for the insufficient donations was discussed to dismantle the city bricks of the east and west Yongmen and supplement the sages in Pat. The deadline was set to complete the repairs within two months. However, the construction of the new prisons in the west of the township is still actively underway, and the initiators have recognized and paid for the exploration of the Yizhong site behind the county government to prepare for construction. The two sides are at a stalemate and it is feared that it will not be easy to resolve it for a while.</p>

When they saw a suspicious person loitering, they immediately went forward, apprehended him, and brought him to the bureau. After preliminary interrogation by Chief Lei, he confessed his name as Li Guanlin, 30 years old, living in Changxiang of this county and working as a cook. He also confessed that he and Yin Shungen, Zhang A'zuo, and others, eight people in total, robbed Shen Kunquan's house, sharing the loot of one silver dollar, etc. Chief Lei recorded his confession and immediately prepared a document yesterday to escort him to the County Public Security Bureau to await transfer to the County for strict handling.</p>
<p>Construction of the Xiyi Road Commences: The Xiyi Provincial Road, constructed by the Construction Bureau, held a groundbreaking ceremony on the 1st of this month.

On the first day of construction, the requisitioned villagers were quite enthusiastic, with more than a thousand people participating and the work progressing smoothly. Therefore, it is expected that the earthworks of the road can be completed within the year to facilitate transportation. Wang Wei, Captain of the Traffic Police Brigade, also selected eight police officers the day before yesterday, equipped with firearms, led by Patrol Chief Qin Shuwang, to protect the road construction workers.</p>
<p>Armed Robbery and Injury Case in Dongdupu Town: The Changdang Lake area in Jintan County is vast and the defenses are weak. Previously, approval was obtained from the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs and Security Office to order the Second Water Police District to dispatch shallow-water gunboats to patrol the area. A few days ago, more than twenty bandits suddenly arrived in Dongdupu Town, armed with broadswords, box cannons, and other weapons. They first confiscated the firearms of the defense corps, then looted the entire town, killing two people and wounding two others with gunfire. Before leaving, they kidnapped seven people and fled by boat towards the Da'ang Mountain area. Yesterday, County Magistrate Zhu Ting of the county sent a letter to Mao Mujun, District Chief of the Second Water Police District, requesting the swift dispatch of three patrol boats to garrison the lake entrance to provide security.</p>
<p>Surtax Remittance to the Province Affects Bureau Funding: The County Government previously received an order from the province that all surtax penalties for late grain tax payments from this year's spring harvest must be remitted to the province in full. County Magistrate Pan repeatedly submitted the difficult situation to the provincial government, requesting that half be remitted to the province and half remain for county use. However, the provincial government has not approved this request because it concerns a general case. Recently, the Construction Bureau stated that the bureau's fixed monthly operating expenses are 260 yuan. In addition to the allocation from the six-fen land tax, the remainder is paid from the industrial expenses, with the allocation from surtax penalties for late grain tax payments accounting for about half. For example, the late fee surtax for the spring grain of 143,942 taels is calculated as 50% over the limit, with an additional levy of 2 jiao and 5 li per tael, totaling silver 14,754 yuan. The late fee for the winter grain of 75,466 shi is calculated as 50% over the limit, with an additional levy of 5 jiao per shi, totaling silver 18,867 yuan. The late fee surtax for reed tax of 349 taels is calculated as 50% over the limit, with an additional levy of 2 jiao and 5 li, totaling silver 357 yuan. If half of the above three items are remitted to the province and half are retained, the Construction Bureau should account for 26%, of which two-thirds totals silver 2,917 yuan. If all of it is remitted to the province, the Construction Bureau's operating expenses will inevitably be affected. Yesterday, a request was specially submitted to the County Government to offset it from the Construction Special Tax to be forwarded for approval to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>A Proclamation for Rectifying the Long-Standing Malpractices of the Judiciary: County Magistrate Tan, considering the prevalence of lawsuits in the local area and the litigious nature of the people compared to other counties, issued a proclamation with the following text: "Since taking office, this magistrate has heard that the long-standing malpractices of the judiciary in Changshu have not been thoroughly rectified. Therefore, judicial personnel have been repeatedly warned to maintain integrity and uphold the dignity of the judiciary to avoid criticism. All judicial police and clerical staff are also paid salaries and must not make demands outside. This magistrate, in order to strengthen rectification, constantly supervises the adjudicators and others to handle litigation matters impartially and without prejudice. All litigants must be straightforward and present the facts truthfully in court, and the matter will be impartially adjudicated based on the law. If anyone dares to attempt bribery to confuse right and wrong, they will be severely punished without leniency once verified. If there are any lawless persons who dare to use this as an excuse to solicit fees, the victim should immediately report to the nearest public security sub-bureau or stationed office to arrest and bring them to the government for strict investigation. However, no one should make false accusations out of spite, causing inconvenience."</p>
<p>Disturbances Occur Again in Xiyang Town: Due to the repeated kidnappings and robberies in Xiyang Town in the Fushan District of this county, the residents in nearby areas such as Jincun are all in constant anxiety. Whenever a warning is received, they panic. At about 9:00 PM the night before last, five pirate ships appeared off the coast of Xiyang. The police stationed there immediately reported by telephone to Miaoqiao and Jincun that five pirate ships had arrived off the coast, but it was unknown where they were heading. Upon hearing the news, the residents of the town fled in droves. Within minutes, Jincun received another phone call stating that the bandits had landed with weapons and were advancing towards the area, urging them to be on alert. Upon receiving this information, the Jincun Business Corps immediately armed themselves with live ammunition and maintained strict vigilance. The merchants and residents of Jincun were also at a loss, and women even went down to the boats to flee. Then, after discussions among the people, stationed police, and the business corps, they decided to take precautions. Around 3:00 AM, they received a call from Miaoqiao stating that a public security team had gone to Xiyang Town, inflicting heavy casualties on the bandits, who had retreated. Only then did the people calm down a bit, but they had already been greatly alarmed.</p>

<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Suspects in Zhou Case Still Need to Be Arrested: In the Zhou Shuiping case, related suspects Zhang Wen, Yang Shao Cheng, Zhang Wufeng, Zhang Bu Lan, Zhu Zhenyang and others had been declared innocent by the court this spring, and all of them had returned to their villages. Zhou Zhongfu, Zhou Shuiping's father, recently submitted another petition to the provincial government regarding the death of his son Zhou Shuiping, urging that the 32nd resolution be consulted and that the Jiangyin county magistrate be ordered to implement it according to law. In addition, the fake attachment should be revoked to conclude the case. The province approved that since the case had been repeatedly submitted by the people, a letter had been sent to the provincial party rectification committee to convene a review as soon as possible, and the investigation results would be discussed to conclude the case. Also, a letter was sent to the National Government's Civil Service Department, urging the investigation and asking them to wait for the handling. The Jiangyin County Party Rectification Committee also held its 47th committee meeting the day before yesterday. Because the Zhou case was in the final stage of resolution by both the provincial party and government agencies, and the wanted criminals had returned to their hometowns, they should be arrested and brought to justice before a resolution is reached to show justice. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the county for handling. After approving the letter, County Magistrate Li ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly implement it.</p>
<p>Ji and Cai are Remitted to the Province but Not Yet Interrogated: Zhu Xingnan (alias Wang Chuntao) from Xiagang was arrested in Suzhou and remitted to the province but has not yet been tried.

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Zheng Chengyuan Confirmed to Have Accepted Bribes in the Liyang Corruption Case: The Zhenjiang Court has repeatedly studied the Liyang land tax corruption case. The day before yesterday, in addition to the first court session to investigate the original plaintiffs Di Shao Chen, Di Fu and Song Mo, the second investigation involved Lu Zhenglin, Zhao Dianhua and Lu Ziven, three old bookkeepers newly summoned from Liyang. After questioning, they were sent to detention. The third time, the five detainees Shi Taorong, Shi Qingyun, Hu Jinghua, Di Hongxun and Ren Shusen were brought to court for investigation until 7 o'clock before being ordered to return to detention. After dinner, another investigation court was opened, and Prosecutor Yan signed an order to bring the six detainees Zheng Chengyuan, Pan Bin, Huang Xingan, Shen Zhiqing, Zhou Shi and Cao Qingan to court for interrogation. After questioning each of them for a long time, although Zheng relied on his eloquence and hoped to escape the law, Mr. Yan had secretly investigated in Liyang and obtained ironclad evidence of bribery, as well as strong witnesses to prove the circumstances. In previous court sessions, Zheng had been high-spirited and seemed to be full of grievances, but after yesterday's court session, his attitude suddenly changed and he seemed ashamed. The interrogation ended late at night and he was ordered to return to detention. It is said that the case will be conducted in two parts: one is the case of Zheng receiving a bribe of 6,000 yuan, and the other is the land tax corruption case. The general situation of the bribery case has been investigated clearly and will be submitted for trial first. The land tax situation is complicated, and the main person in charge, former county magistrate Zhang Quan, is still at large, so it is feared that the case will be difficult to conclude in the shortest possible time.</p>

<p>Construction Bonds Are Not Allowed to Be Reduced or Exempted: The Jiangsu Provincial Government issued 7 million yuan in construction bonds, and the regulations for distributing and using the funds have been drafted and submitted to the National Government for approval. Recently, a small number of counties have had citizens who have misunderstood the situation and directly petitioned the provincial government to request exemption or reduction of the allocated bonds. They have been approved separately. Now, Commissioners Chen, Hu, and Sun have proposed that citizens from four counties, including Wuxian, etc., petition for exemption from the construction bonds and request that the county magistrates of the four counties be strictly ordered to be responsible for persuading and guiding them to facilitate the progress.

<p>Recent News on the Construction Corruption Case at the Business School: The case of construction corruption at the Jiaxing Business School has been repeatedly reported by local people, but the authorities have not taken effective measures, resulting in the embezzlement of more than 10,000 yuan of public funds. The year before last, Zhou Guoxun and other local citizens filed a complaint with the court, and the relevant persons were summoned for questioning. Because a certain person, the most important person involved, had left, the evidence was insufficient and the court ruled that no prosecution would be pursued. Zhou Guoxun, believing that the matter concerned public funds and should not be allowed to be embezzled, recently sent repeated telegrams to the county government to demand compensation.

<p>Educational News Highlights</p>
<h3>Before the Minister of Education Also Acting as Minister Arrives, Department Affairs Will Be Signed by Liu Dabai</h3>
<p>The resignation of Jiang Menglin, Minister of Education, has been approved and he left Beijing the day before yesterday. At the same time, he submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to have Liu Dabai, Political Vice Minister, temporarily act as the minister of education. When Gao Lu, the new minister, arrives at the department, Liu will be responsible for handling the handover. On the 6th, the National Government announced that Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan will concurrently act as the Minister of Education before Gao's arrival. On the same day, the National Government issued a general order to the country to rectify the academic atmosphere. The above sections have all been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper, but Premier Jiang of the Executive Yuan is currently touring Jiangxi and Hubei and will not be able to go to the department to inspect things in a short time. Therefore, the question of who should be responsible for signing the Ministry of Education's external documents is an issue that can be researched in terms of administrative procedures, and departmental affairs cannot be stopped. On the 8th, Liu Dabai, the Political Vice Minister of Education, went to the Executive Yuan to ask for instructions. As a result of the consultation, it was decided that before the acting minister takes over, the name of Minister Jiang Menglin, with Political Vice Minister Liu Dabai signing on his behalf, will still be used to issue documents.</p>

<h3>The Course of the Qingdao University Incident</h3>
<p>Due to the dismissal of new students who used fake certificates to apply</p>
<p>Expelled 17 people who incited the disturbance, classes have now resumed</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: After the Ministry of Education ordered the abolition of the university preparatory system this year, the qualification restrictions for undergraduate applicants to various universities have become extremely strict. After receiving this order from the ministry, the National Qingdao University had to seriously handle the review of the credentials of the new students admitted this year. As a result, it was discovered that more than 20 people used fake certificates to apply to the school. The school authorities immediately ordered their dismissal without further investigation. These dismissed students went to the school's student union on the evening of the 4th to request assistance. The union convened a temporary general meeting to discuss countermeasures and the attitude to be taken. It was decided to implement a strike starting from the 4th to show resolute support. At the same time, the school authorities also convened a school affairs meeting and resolved the following important matters: 1. Students must go through proper procedures for any request to the school and must not resort to strikes to coerce. An announcement should be made to all students to attend classes immediately. No requests will be considered until classes are resumed. 2. The school's student union was organized without legal procedures, which violates the central regulations and interferes with the school's administration. An announcement should be made to all students to inform them that the current illegal student union and its resolutions are invalid. Before a legal student union is established, any matters related to the school will only be accepted if signed by individuals responsible for them. The school authorities issued an announcement based on the previous resolution, advising all students to attend classes as usual and not to take any excessive actions. The majority of the students were willing to obey the school's orders and attend classes as usual. However, the students who used fake certificates joined forces with a few troublemakers to form a disciplinary team, armed with wooden sticks, to prevent classes from starting. The situation was turbulent and almost led to a disaster. The school authorities, fearing that the situation would escalate, convened a school affairs meeting again at 10:00 AM on the 5th. After a long discussion, the following resolutions were reached: 1. Students who used fake certificates, except for those who have voluntarily withdrawn, should have their student status revoked in accordance with the Ministry's regulations and be required to leave the school by 5:00 PM today. The list is attached below. Those who voluntarily withdrew (8 people): Shi Weifan, Li Qianpeng, Tan Mei, Tan Yulan, Huang Yubin, Tang Yuexuan, Liu Jie. Those who were expelled (13 people): Li Jiafan, Wang Jingxi, Cao Shaoming, Wang Boying, Xie Gancai, Fan Ren, Liu Peizhi, Chai Keqing, Yi Eryan, Chen Lezhen, Chen Chaojie, Zhang Guosheng, Zhu Weizhi. 2. The main instigators of this strike incident have been identified as Wang Jingxi, Li Jiafan, Liu Peizhi, Chai Keqing, Ni Eryan, Lu Shiliang, Tang Guanyun, Liu Haigao, Wu Shixun, Sun Tingzhang, Yue Yuan, Hao Lucheng, Cao Wujing, Zhu Baoguang, Shi Xiaoshun, Zheng Shouchong, Yu Hang, and 17 others. In addition to the above two cases being announced separately, an announcement was also made to all students to reassure them to study and not to panic themselves. The incident has subsided and classes have resumed as usual. Yesterday, all faculty members convened a general meeting of all students in the auditorium to give instructions and encourage them to focus on their studies. The situation was excellent.

<h3>Shanghai-Hankou Airline Plane Crashes Yesterday Morning, Commander Xiong Shihui Severely Injured</h3>
<p>Shanghai Second Plane Plunges After Takeoff, Striking Mast</p>
<p>Pilot, Two Passengers Die of Injuries After Rescue Attempts</p>
<p>Yang Yongtai Injured in the Waist, Life Expected to Be Saved</p>
<p>Xiong Shihui, Songhu Garrison Commander, was summoned by Chairman Chiang to go to Jiangxi and then to Hunan, Hubei, and other provinces to inspect and assist in suppressing the communist bandits. Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, Xiong, along with General Headquarters advisor Yang Yongtai and bodyguard Zeng Chunfan, boarded China Aviation Corporation's Shanghai Second plane to go to Xunyang. They departed from Longhua Airport. The pilot was American pilot Bell, and the mechanical assistant was Bian Fugen. Passengers included Xiong and the other two men, as well as Russian woman Mrs. An Qulifu, and Yin Wenlong, manager of the Hankou Anli Foreign Firm's automobile department. The plane carried a total of seven people, but shortly after taking off, about fifty feet off the ground, the plane's right wing collided with the large mast of a sand barge. The wing broke, the mast broke, and the plane suddenly plunged to the beach on the riverbank at exactly eight minutes past eight. As a result, American pilot Bell, Chinese mechanical assistant Bian Fugen, the Russian woman, and Yin Wenlong died of severe injuries. Xiong Shihui, Yang Yongtai, and Zeng Chunfan were seriously injured. This is a unprecedented tragedy in the history of Chinese aviation. The details of the accident are described as follows:</p>
<p>Send-off Spectacle: Yesterday morning at 7:50, Xiong Shihui, accompanied by Yang Yongtai and others, arrived at Longhua Airport by car. Chiefs and secretaries of various departments of the Garrison Headquarters went to see them off. The area around the airport was heavily guarded by troops from the Fifth Division. The Headquarters military band was also present. Xiong and others slowly boarded the plane amidst the lively music, smiling and shaking hands with those who came to see them off.</p>
<p>Course of the Accident: Yesterday morning at eight o'clock, Shanghai Second plane took off from the ground. The southwest wind was strong, so the plane rose along the riverbank to the opposite bank of the Lan Nidu in Pudong, near the Rihui Bridge on the riverbank. The plane was already fifty feet off the ground when it suddenly collided with the large mast of a sand barge of about 2,000 tons moored there. With a loud crash, the right wing of the plane broke immediately, and the large mast, as wide as a hug, also broke at the same time. The plane lost its balance, and the front of the plane immediately tilted, falling from the air onto the mudflat outside Rihui Bridge, only about ten minutes after takeoff.</p>
<p>Rushing to the Rescue: When the plane crashed, the people seeing them off and the airline staff had not yet dispersed. Seeing this, they rushed along the riverbank to rescue. The distance from Rihui Bridge to the airport was about a mile, but the water was deep and muddy, and their clothes were soaked. Half of the plane was submerged in the mudflat. Passengers and the pilot were moaning inside, bloodstains were everywhere, and the scene was too horrible to bear. They quickly opened the plane door, called for several sampans, and carried the injured out one by one, transporting them to the airport by boat.</p>
<p>Pilot Dies: American pilot Bell and mechanical assistant Bian Fugen were seated in the front of the plane, so their injuries were the most severe. Bian Fugen had a large hole in his forehead, and blood flowed non-stop. Russian woman An Qulifu also suffered severe brain trauma, and her hands and feet were broken. The three were carried ashore, but were already unable to speak. Mechanical assistant Bian Fugen (above), American pilot Bell (below)</p>
<p>They were rushed to the Red Cross General Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. When they arrived at the hospital, Bell was already beyond medical help and died immediately. After thirty minutes, Bian Fugen and the Russian woman also died one after another. Yin Wenlong, manager of the Hankou Anli Foreign Firm's automobile department, had fractures in his right hand and right foot, and his chest and waist were also severely injured. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for emergency surgery. At twelve o'clock, at the insistence of Yin's family and friends, he was transferred to the Public Concession Hospital for X-ray examination. Due to excessive bleeding and severe brain trauma, he died at four o'clock yesterday afternoon. The body was then moved to the International Funeral Parlor. The bodies of the American pilot and Bian Fugen were moved to the Forensic Examination Office in Feilun, scheduled for court examination this morning.</p>
<p>Xiong's Treatment: Xiong Shihui's seat in the plane was number one, in the first row, so his injuries were less severe than those of the pilot. Situation of Shanghai Second plane after the crash (Photo by this newspaper)</p>
<p>After the accident, headquarters staff took him to the Longhua Headquarters by car and called the director of Baolong Hospital and a German doctor to give him emergency treatment. At the same time, they telegraphed Niu Huisheng, director of the Shanghai Private Orthopedic Hospital, to come to treat him. Niu had gone to Wusong for a morning consultation at six o'clock and did not return home until nine o'clock, then rushed to Longhua to treat him. At 9:30, Xiong and his bodyguard Zeng Sand barge broken mast and plane fallen into the river (Photo by this newspaper)</p>

<p>Chunfan were taken to the Private Shanghai Orthopedic Hospital at 852 Xujiahui Road. Xiong was taken to room number one. Immediately after arriving at the hospital, Dr. Niu Huisheng performed emergency surgery, bandaging the broken left hand and right foot and injecting a cardiac stimulant. Xiong was quite lucid at the time. He fell asleep at about 11:00. X-rays were taken at 12:00 and a bone-setting operation was performed at 2:30 in the afternoon. The situation in the afternoon was better than in the morning.</p>
<p>Injury Report: Dr. Niu Huisheng released a report on the injuries of Xiong Shihui and Zeng Chunfan at 5:00 yesterday afternoon. The report was signed by Dr. Niu Huisheng and Niu Huilin. It is transcribed as follows: Commander Xiong Shihui has six injuries: (1) The upper segment of the left humerus is broken into three pieces. (2) The femur and tibia of the right leg are fractured. (3) Head injury with significant bleeding. (4) Right hand abrasion. (5) Rib pain in the chest. (6) Brain concussion, but still conscious. Xiong's temperature was 99.4 degrees yesterday afternoon, pulse 118, respiration 25. Aide Zeng Chunfan has four injuries: (1) Fracture of the left humerus. (2) Fracture of the right femur. (3) Rib pain. (4) Lacerations of the mouth and nose with bleeding. His temperature was 98 degrees, pulse 128, respiration 32. According to Dr. Niu, if Xiong's condition does not change within 48 hours, he should gradually recover his health, but he will need to stay in the hospital for at least two months.</p>
<p>Condolences Pour In: Yesterday, after hearing the news, people from all walks of life went to the orthopedic hospital to offer condolences. When Xiong was injured and taken to the Headquarters, Mayor Zhang and Public Security Bureau Chief Yuan Liang rushed to offer condolences and accompanied him to the orthopedic hospital. Shortly after, Madam Chiang Song Meiling, wife of Chiang Kai-shek, Madam Sun Ke, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Yang Hu, Chen Shiguang, Liu Yunfang, and others arrived one after another. They were all received by Jiang Yi, the deputy chief of staff of the Headquarters. China Aviation Corporation also sent Wang Xichang to inquire about the injuries.</p>
<p>Yang's Condition: Yang Yongtai's injuries were the lightest. His family took him to Baolong Hospital on Baker Road for treatment. After examination by Dr. Ruan Shangcheng, he formally announced to reporters yesterday that Yang was only injured in the waist and could not lie flat. He coughed up a mouthful of blood after arriving at the hospital, indicating that his lungs were traumatized. Currently, because he cannot stand up, X-rays cannot be taken. It is expected that the injuries will not be life-threatening. Former Shanghai Mayor Huang Fu went to Baolong Hospital to offer condolences.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies of the Deceased: American pilot Bell was 36 years old. He served in the aviation field during the European War and then worked as a pilot for the American Commercial Aviation Company. He came to Shanghai on October 20 to accept a position with China Aviation Corporation. Mechanical assistant Bian Fugen was a native of Wuxi, 25 years old. His father and wife were in Wuxi. He had a younger brother, Rengen, studying printing in Shanghai. Bian had been working for the airline for almost a year. He was usually diligent and hardworking and was highly valued by the authorities. He started as a trainee and was recently promoted to his current position. Yesterday, his younger brother had already telegraphed Wuxi to ask his parents to come to Shanghai to handle the funeral arrangements. Yin Wenlong was 27 years old, a native of Suzhou. He was the Chinese manager of the automobile department of the Anli Foreign Firm in Hankou. His family lived in Hankou. He came to Shanghai to negotiate business and stayed for less than a week. His sudden death is truly tragic. The Russian woman, Mrs. Zhi Qulifu, ran a tailor shop in Hankou and usually traveled between Shanghai and Hankou by plane. Yesterday morning, her friends came to the airport to see her off. Unexpectedly, she met with such a tragic fate.</p>
<p>Company's Aftermath: After the accident, the company sent two doctors, an American doctor and Chinese doctor Chen Jiyao, to various hospitals to treat the injured personnel. According to Nie Kaiyi, who spoke to our newspaper reporter yesterday, he was also present at the scene of the accident and witnessed that it was a great misfortune for both the company and the passengers. In addition to reporting the actual situation to the Ministry of Communications, the company is also handling the aftermath. The Shanghai-Hankou air route will continue to operate as usual. All pilots have been ordered to drive with utmost caution.</p>
<p>Plane Continues: Yesterday morning at 8:00, China Aviation Corporation originally planned to have two planes depart. One was the Shanghai Second plane that crashed, bound for Jiujiang and Hankou. The other was the Chongqing plane, test-flying to Yichang. The Shanghai plane was originally scheduled to have assistant pilot Chen Huazhen assist in the driving, but Bian Fugen was suddenly replaced. After the accident, the Chongqing plane was temporarily delayed. After the rescue was completed, company staff took out the mail from Shanghai Second plane and transferred it to the Chongqing plane for transport to various ports. The Chongqing plane, driven by American Hanton, departed at 10:20 yesterday morning for Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places.</p>
<p>Worth 100,000: The Shanghai Second plane was purchased when Sino-American Aviation Corporation was established. It can accommodate six passengers and two pilots and is an amphibious plane. Each plane is worth about 100,000 national currency. This time, the right wing was broken and the internal machinery was completely damaged and beyond repair. Yesterday afternoon, the wrecked plane was still in the mudflat on the riverbank. It was heard that it could not be towed ashore until today. Furthermore, according to company staff who witnessed the scene, it was fortunate that the accident occurred on a mudflat with soft soil. If it had fallen on land, none of the crew and passengers would have survived.</p>
<p>Lack of Technical Expertise: According to another source, American pilot Bell arrived in Shanghai on October 20 and has only been in China for a little over a month. He is not familiar with the local situation and has only driven a few times. The most skilled Chinese pilot in the airline is Lin Anjun. Last Thursday, after Lin and Bell flew the same plane back to Shanghai, Lin formally reported to the director of the airline department, American Smis, that Bell's skills were somewhat lacking and asked that he not be given the responsibility of flying. However, Smis ignored him and allowed him to fly as usual, which led to the disaster.</p>
<p>News This Morning: At 9:00 last night, Dr. Niu Huisheng returned to the orthopedic hospital to examine Xiong. At that time, his temperature was slightly lower, at 96 degrees. There was no change in pulse or respiration. His condition was quite good. At about 1:00 this morning, Dr. Niu went to examine Xiong again. Xiong's temperature had increased to 100.4 degrees. He was in better spirits and could drink some orange juice. Xiong's bodyguard, Zeng Chunfan, had shortness of breath in the evening, but it subsided again later in the evening. Furthermore, according to those who personally sent Xiong to board the plane yesterday, Xiong's seat in the plane was number one. His back was directly facing the back of the crew, but separated by a thick glass. Next to Xiong was Yang Yongtai. Opposite Xiong was his bodyguard Zeng Chunfan. Behind Zeng's seat was the Russian woman. Sitting with the Russian woman was Yin Wenlong. The front and rear parts of the plane were the most severely injured, while the middle part was less injured. Xiong, Yang, and Zeng happened to be in the middle part. It was also said that Yin's female relatives were also at the scene to see him off. Seeing the plane crash, they disregarded everything and waded into the water to rescue him. The situation was extremely tragic. The efforts of the Garrison Headquarters Detective Team to bravely protect and rescue Xiong were also commendable.</p>
<h3>Mayor Zhang Hopes for Sino-British Cooperation</h3>
<p>Speech at Yesterday's Banquet for the British Economic Mission</p>
<p>Mayor Zhang hosted a banquet for the entire British Economic Mission at Chen's residence at 6 Seymour Road at 7:00 last night. Those in attendance included local business leaders Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Xinliu, the British Consul-General, the Commercial Counselor, Zhao Jinqing, Chen Shiguang, Wu Tiecheng, the Municipal Government Secretary-General, and the heads of various bureaus. That evening, Mayor Zhang gave a very long speech, full of sincerity. It is transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Gentlemen of the British Commercial Delegation, you have come to China on a tour for the purpose of developing trade between our two countries and promoting friendship between our two nations. I would like to take this opportunity to offer you a humble feast and sincerely welcome you to do my part as a host. It is an honor to have you here. I recall that three weeks ago, my colleagues in the Municipal Government hosted a banquet to welcome the British Canadian Commercial Delegation. I was unable to attend in person due to official business in Beijing. I am even more pleased to be able to personally welcome you this time. Since the European War, the world economic situation has undergone drastic changes. Whether a country is small and densely populated or large and rich in resources, they have all been opening up new markets abroad to exchange what they have for what they lack, so that the problems of overproduction and unemployment can be solved to some extent. This time, the United Kingdom has specially sent Sir Ernest Thompson to lead the British Far East Economic Mission to tour East Asia. Its purpose is to investigate the current state of trade in the Far East, the future development trends, and the perceptions of the Chinese government and people towards the United Kingdom, and then plan how to cooperate with China for mutual benefit to develop future trade and how to compare with other countries to restore its inherent trading position. Its impact on political, economic, industrial, and commercial circles between China and Britain is extremely important and significant. As a host, we should sincerely express our welcome and, for the sake of the future development of Sino-British trade, we should discuss with sincerity and vision, so that in addition to the reception and banquet, we will have infinite expectations. Now, I would like to briefly express my views on Sino-British trade relations. According to this year's customs records, the trade situation between the United Kingdom and its British territories, excluding Hong Kong, still maintains its inherent position. For example, in 1929, imports accounted for 21.67% of China's total imports, while in 1928, they only accounted for 19.6%. Both imports and exports show an increasing trend. For example, in 1922, the value of goods transported from China to Britain was only 38,507,874 taels of customs silver. In 1929, it jumped to 74,334,237 taels. In 1929, the value of goods transported from Britain to China was 119,148,969 taels. Although it was slightly lower than in 1922, 1923 and 1924, it was 44,076,575 taels higher than in 1927. The speed of its progress can be seen generally. Currently, the goods transported from Britain to China are mainly steel, textiles, machinery, piece goods, and tinplate. This is because cities in China have been actively innovating and striving for construction in recent years. Most of the houses built are made of steel bars and concrete, so the sales of building steel and plain iron bars are extremely wide. These goods are mostly ordered from British and Belgian companies. Furthermore, the import of steel wire rope is mostly used for mines, especially salt mines in Sichuan, which are also supplied in large quantities by British and American manufacturers. As for British tinplate, it will continue to be imported to supply canned food manufacturers. This industry is becoming increasingly developed in China, so the future sales of tinplate can be predicted. In addition, high-quality artificial silk operated by British merchants will still maintain its original status. In recent years, the production of artificial silk has been abundant, the price is low, and the quality is good. Its promotion in China may not always be smooth. This is the general situation of goods transported from Britain to China. Now, let us discuss the goods exported from China to Britain, which should be mainly soybeans, soybean products, eggs, egg products, and other agricultural products. For example, in recent years, the soybean market in Manchuria has been improving, and the harvest is quite abundant. Every season, more and more goods are transported to Japan and Europe. Furthermore, the sales of soybean oil exported to various parts of Europe have also improved significantly. In the past, households in the country used soybean oil as fuel, but now they have switched to foreign oil, so soybean oil is mostly sold abroad, and exports are booming. This is also a major reason. As for eggs and egg products, they are also a major export from China. For example, every winter, the climate in Europe is extremely cold, and egg prices skyrocket, which is a good opportunity for China to engage in this trade. Furthermore, canned frozen eggs are now widely sold in various parts of Europe, and exports are booming, and they are being sold at good prices. Moreover, the methods of breeding and manufacturing are being improved practically, and the future development is immeasurable. Other products such as pig bristles, oils, coarse cloth, hardware, minerals, monosodium glutamate powder, etc. produced in China have all increased in value in recent years, and it may not be difficult to develop them further in the British market in the future. This is the general situation of goods transported from China to Britain. To sum up, it is sufficient to prove that Sino-British trade has been booming in recent years. This is because my country is vast and rich in resources, with a large population, rich agricultural products, and strong purchasing power. At this time, the country is unified, the politics are reformed, and all construction is in full swing. The need for raw materials and industrial products is greater than in any other country. After local stability, the increase in exports of agricultural products can also be asserted. In terms of material matters, I deeply hope that friendly countries will provide kind assistance and cooperate sincerely, so that the spirit of human mutual assistance can achieve international mutual benefit. There is no prejudice in accepting or rejecting, and there must be a connection between what is and what is not. No matter which country in the world, if it can open up its vision, abide by fair trade, treat each other equally, and interact with us Chinese with the purpose of mutual assistance, a friendly attitude, sincere feelings, then our government and people will unite as one, based on the spirit of a civilized country with 5,000 years of history, the belief in reciprocity, and express our sincere sympathy and recognize it as a country of mutual benefit and assistance, so that we can work together to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity. If we violate this principle of fairness and friendship and hold on to our narrow minds, wrong ideas, and short-sightedness, and focus on developing our one-sided interests and satisfying our unilateral desires, and do not pay attention to our country's national conditions, public opinion, productivity, and purchasing power, the result will be a pity for trade between the two countries. Such regrets will be an obstacle to the development of trade between both parties. If we do not foresee and understand this, and transform it into nothingness, then even the shortest period of prosperity in international commercial history will inevitably decline and be eliminated by natural selection. I and all of you present here have the responsibility to eliminate this kind of regret and eliminate this kind of obstacle. I deeply hope that your government will be able to exert all efforts to eliminate all policies that hinder the commercial development of our two countries and all kinds of unequal facts, so as to enhance the goodwill of the people of our two countries, so that we can mutually assist and support each other to achieve the benefits of trade. The benefits of trade lie in mutual benefit, and the foundation of mutual benefit is built on equality, mutual assistance, friendship, and sincere feelings. I also hope that you will understand this meaning and be able to earnestly suggest to your government after your tour to the East to promote its realization and open up a bright and brilliant new record in the history of Sino-British trade, so that you will not have made this trip in vain, which is also my earnest hope.</p>
<h3>Telegraphic Request to Stipulate the Number of Overseas Chinese Representatives in the National Assembly</h3>
<p>Excellent Telegram from the Overseas Chinese Federation</p>
<p>The Overseas Chinese Federation, in view of the decision of the Fourth Plenary Session to convene the National Assembly on May 1st next year, telegraphed the central party and government organs yesterday, requesting that the number of overseas Chinese representatives be stipulated. The telegram is transcribed as follows: "Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Executive Yuan, Legislative Yuan, Examination Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Control Yuan, Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Industry, all are aware that the Premier said, 'Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution.' The contributions of overseas Chinese to the country have been universally recognized. During the Wuchang Uprising, when the Premier returned to the East, overseas Chinese sages followed him to Shanghai to plan the revolution. The contributions of overseas Chinese were the reason for the proposal of overseas Chinese participation in politics. Finally, with the Premier's leadership, the upper levels belonged to the association and various overseas Chinese groups jointly requested at the lower levels and won six seats for overseas Chinese senators. Thus, even Yuan Shikai, who harbored hostility towards the political status of overseas Chinese, had to reluctantly acknowledge it. Since then, no warlord or bureaucrat dared to oppose overseas Chinese participation in politics. In 1925, the Northern Government nominally responded to the Premier's advocacy and convened the so-called National Representative Assembly, which also stipulated the number of overseas Chinese representatives as 16, divided into three representatives each from the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia, and one representative each from Siam, Annam, Burma, Taiwan, the Philippines, and Russia, and a total of four representatives from Europe, America, Africa, Australia, Japan, and Korea. The National Assembly advocated by our Premier intends to have nine kinds of organizations, including modern industrial groups, chambers of commerce, educational associations, universities, provincial student federations, labor unions, agricultural associations, and joint opposition to Cao Kun and Wu Peifu's armies and political parties, each elect representatives to participate in the organization. Except for the eighth item, which has already passed, there is no need to discuss it. The industrial groups, chambers of commerce, labor unions, agricultural associations, educational associations, and universities referred to do not limit them to the domestic side. All overseas Chinese chambers of commerce, agricultural associations, labor unions, educational associations, universities, and other industrial groups that have been registered with the competent authorities before today should also be included in the participation. Based on the close relationship between the Premier and the overseas Chinese during his 40 years of revolutionary efforts, it can be asserted that the various organizations designated by the Premier must include overseas Chinese. Your Ministry is following the will and scheduling the National Assembly and is drafting the organizational law. We urgently telegraph this humble opinion, requesting that Your Ministry grant us the Overseas Chinese Federation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Does Not Change Police Authority on Extra-Settlement Roads</h3>
<p>Instructions from Bureau Chief Yuan</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau instructed the district chiefs: "In order to enforce the order, it has been found that various Chinese and foreign newspapers today have a news item on the 'Police Authority Issue on Roads Built in the Extra-Settlement Area.' The article stated that starting from Monday, the Public Concession Police Station will be adding automobile patrol teams to patrol the roads built by the bureau outside the Concession. The head of the police station, Gan Laide, stated that the previous practice of Chinese police guarding the roads and stopping cars has also been stopped. Foreigners have not said anything about this, and he also stated that the issue of police authority on the roads of the bureau is being negotiated between the Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities. Although no date has been set for the discussion, it is expected to be soon. This bureau is responsible for protecting all Chinese and foreign people in the city. As winter prevention is approaching, it is especially our duty to conduct checks on pedestrians and vehicles in order to prevent all kinds of harmful events. The police authority on the roads built by the Public Concession Police Station outside the Concession was never entitled to be exercised by the Public Concession Police Station. The original police posts and inspection stations for checking pedestrians and vehicles set up by this bureau on each of these roads have not been stopped or changed. The aforementioned situation is extremely shocking. In addition to issuing orders and questioning the Superintendent of the Public Concession Police, please respond. The chiefs are hereby ordered to comply and continue to handle matters seriously as before. Please thoroughly investigate and report on whether the Public Concession Police has increased the number of automobile patrol teams on the roads in question and report back to us for verification. This order is hereby issued on December 9, 1920 of the Republic of China. Director Yuan Liang."</p>

<h3>Dr. Wu Liande's Banquet for the Shipping Industry Last Night</h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Liande, Director of the National Maritime Quarantine Service, hosted a banquet last night at 8 PM at the Old Carlton Hotel on Ningbo Road to foster camaraderie with leaders of the local shipping industry. Attendees included representatives from the Jianghai Customs, China Merchants, Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Changxing, Lick茂, Ting Bao, Dalae, Pacific, French, 賚賜, 保和, Prince, Meishun, Tianxiang, Fulai, Nippon Yusen, Nissin, Osaka Shosen, and Java, among other Chinese and foreign shipping companies. In his address, Dr. Wu stated that since his appointment as Director of the Quarantine Service by the central government in July, he had intended to meet with leaders of the Shanghai shipping industry. Unfortunately, the sudden outbreak of the plague in the autumn kept him extremely busy until now. Maritime quarantine affairs had previously been managed concurrently by the Customs. After the Ministry of Health organized the National Quarantine Service, he took over the responsibility. He expressed his gratitude to the Customs authorities for their support whenever necessary. He acknowledged that all those present were giants in the shipping industry, deeply aware of the close relationship between maritime health and commerce, and therefore, there was no need for him to elaborate. The staff of his service were carefully selected for their knowledge and extensive experience, ensuring minimal conflict with the shipping industry during the execution of their duties. While there might occasionally be slight differences of opinion, once understanding was reached, disputes would immediately dissipate. The Health Service had promulgated the Maritime Quarantine Regulations in July, which were drafted with the assistance of Dr. Barker, Director of Quarantine for Australia and Director of the Plague Section of the Health Organization of the League of Nations. The regulations were carefully reviewed to ensure they were suitable for China, especially the port of Shanghai. Many experts considered them to be the most innovative quarantine regulations in the world. China had already ratified the 1926 Paris Health Convention, and his service would certainly comply with all the provisions of the convention and provide all necessary emergency quarantine measures. He hoped that all parties would cooperate sincerely to prevent the import and export of infectious diseases, benefiting everyone. He emphasized that the matter was difficult and requested everyone's friendly understanding and cooperation, so that they could mutually benefit from it. His service would treat ships and personnel from all countries equally, without any bias. Mr. Fan Den, representing Taikoo Shipping Company, then delivered a speech on behalf of the attendees from the shipping industry, after which the gathering dispersed.</p>
<h3>Fu A-quan, Principal Offender in the Four Banks Robbery Case, Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>Composed a Poem Before Execution to Express his Aspirations</p>
<p>Also Claimed to be a Catholic</p>
<p>Seeking Confession to Ascend to Heaven</p>
<p>Smiled While Smoking a Cigarette Before Execution</p>
<p>Fu A-quan was among the criminals arrested by the police for intercepting and robbing funds prepared for delivery from the Four Banks warehouse. He was tried and convicted by the Special District Court. He was sentenced to death and his sentence was submitted to the higher authorities for approval. Upon receiving the order from above, the court notified the police to escort Fu A-quan from the Western Prison to the court yesterday afternoon. Judge Cheng Shangfeng opened the court to announce the verdict. The convict then expressed his grievances and said that since he was going to die, he had to compose a poem to express his aspirations. He also requested wine and food. Judge Cheng then provided him with paper and a pen. Fu wrote several lines that were neither a seven-character quatrain nor a five-character ancient poem, nor did they resemble modern poetry. The characters were also illegible and smudged. He was still trying to find joy in the face of death, and he was very pleased with himself. After reciting it, Judge Cheng ordered his handwriting to be attached to the file. Then, the bailiffs purchased food for Fu, who ate his fill. He then ordered the detectives to escort him to the Second Prison execution ground in Puhejing by car. The Special District Court Procuratorate dispatched Prosecutor Li, along with Police Chief Yang Deshan, Police Inspector Chen Xihui, Execution Officers Xue Bingzhang, Gu Hanqing, Zhu Wanyuan, and Zhang Chunsen, among others, to the execution ground by car. After the judge and Warden Dong took their seats, the convict was brought to the case. He stated that he was 22 years old, from Wuxian, and had worked as a calligrapher at the Hainal Bank on the Six Horse Road. He lived at the Yao Shuntai Rental Shop on Dagu Road and had a mother and a sister. His mother's surname was Zheng. He then requested a pen to write a will. At that time, Lu Bohong also performed a confession for him. The convict knelt on the ground and said, "I am a Catholic, please perform a confession for me so that I can ascend to heaven." Lu then sprinkled him with holy water. The convict then requested a cigarette, smoked it, and went to his execution smiling. The prosecutor then ordered the execution to be carried out. Police Chief Yang directed the execution officers to take him down and execute him by firing squad. The body was collected by the court for burial.</p>
<h3>Issue of Releasing a Criminal for Attempted Murder</h3>
<p>Two Judgments from the Former Mixed Court</p>
<p>Having Served Five and a Half Years</p>
<p>His Wife Applies for Release on his Behalf</p>
<p>Police Lawyer Raises an Objection</p>
<p>On June 14th of the fourteenth year of the Republic, the former Mixed Court sentenced Fang Ren to five years' imprisonment for attempted murder. When the case was reviewed with the assessor at the end of the term, the assessor consul sentenced him to ten years' imprisonment. He has now served five and a half years. A woman named Zheng Cai, claiming to be Fang Ren's wife, hired a lawyer to submit a petition to the Special District Court, stating that her husband had been sentenced to five years by Chinese officials and that his term had now expired, requesting that he be released on bail. After receiving the petition, the Special District Court notified the police. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi also submitted a petition, stating that the Municipal Council absolutely recognized the validity of the Mixed Court assessor consul's judgment and that there was no need to change it according to the recovery agreement, requesting that the woman's request be rejected. The petition consisted of thousands of words, which are not detailed here. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu opened the court. Lawyer Ru raised two preliminary questions: (1) Does this case fall under the jurisdiction of the Special District Court? (2) The surname of the convict and the surname of the petitioner do not have a single character in common. Is the petitioner actually his wife? Please make a ruling. Judge Wu then questioned Fang Ren about the reasons for requesting release. According to his statement, he was weak and suffering from tuberculosis, and the ten-year sentence had already been served for more than half the time. The court ordered Fang Ren to be taken back into custody for further review.</p>
<h3>Russian Woman Creates Waves of Jealousy</h3>
<p>Shoots and Wounds her Lover with a Gun</p>
<p>Sentenced to Two Years' Imprisonment with Probation</p>
<p>An Italian man, Bai Danla (transliteration), previously developed a relationship with a young Russian woman, Wufunuo, 26 years old, in Harbin, in northern China. Their friendship progressed into love, and they lived together like a married couple. Last year, they fled to Shanghai and resided at 228 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. Bai Danla worked at the Keda Photo Studio. Unexpectedly, Bai recently became involved with another Russian woman. One day, when Bai returned to his residence and took off his clothes, Wufunuo found a photo of Bai Danla and the Russian woman together in Bai's pocket. Jealousy flared up, and she started arguing with Bai. Bai took this opportunity to separate from Wufunuo and live elsewhere. Seven months have passed since then. Although Bai often visited Wufunuo, he only chatted and showed no affection. On the 28th of last month, Wufunuo called Bai Danla to her residence to talk. Wufunuo asked Bai if his relationship with the newly acquainted Russian woman was permanent. Bai replied that he had the freedom to marry her and that she should not interfere. Hearing this, Wufunuo was filled with anger and immediately returned to the bedroom. She took out a pistol and fired two shots at Bai, hitting his left arm. She was about to fire a third shot when the bullet jammed. At that time, Bai stepped forward and snatched the pistol. The police arrived and arrested Wufunuo. Bai went to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, after his injuries healed, the police brought both parties to the French Concession Court for questioning. First, the police chief explained the situation. Then, Zhe Danla, a businessman, claimed that he had been living with the defendant, Wufunuo, for six years and that they had always been on good terms. However, the defendant was prone to nervous breakdowns. That day, her old illness recurred, and she attacked him with a gun. He requested a severe punishment. Wufunuo confessed that she had been living with the plaintiff for many years and that they had always been on good terms. Recently, he had found a new love and abandoned her like a worn-out shoe. That day, she was so angry that she intended to kill him and then commit suicide. Unexpectedly, the bullet jammed, and no one died. After confessing, she cried loudly. The Chinese and Western judges ruled that Wufunuo should not have attacked him with a gun. She was sentenced to two years' imprisonment with a five-year probation. The pistol was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Deng Zhonghe's Experience with Extortion by Bandits</h3>
<p>First Newspaper Advertisement, Then Sticky Notes</p>
<p>Finally, a Meeting Scheduled at Zhenhua Hotel for Payment</p>
<p>Detectives Ambushed in the Adjacent Room</p>
<p>The Bandits were Captured in One Fell Swoop Upon Entering the Room</p>
<p>Deng Zhonghe, the owner of the Daqing Cotton Cloth Store at 378 Ningbo Road, had previously been kidnapped. The police arrested several kidnappers, who were sentenced accordingly. Not long after the case was closed, Deng received another threatening letter from bandits stating that many of their comrades had lost their lives because of him, causing them great losses. They demanded a loan of 2,000 yuan to compensate the dead. If he was sincere, he could notify them by placing an advertisement in the newspaper. Deng followed the instructions in the letter and placed an advertisement in the newspaper. The next day, he received another letter from the bandits with a sticky note saying that they had seen the advertisement. Please stick this sticky note on the door and there would be movement. Deng did as he was told. On the 7th of this month, the bandits sent a letter scheduling Deng to go to the Zhenhua Hotel on Fuzhou Road at 4 pm on the 8th to discuss matters in a private room. They also instructed him to write "Sun Fengji" on the guest list and put the money, which must be in 100 yuan notes, in an envelope wrapped in newspaper, and place the package in the drawer of the table in the room he had booked. Someone would come to take it. On the morning of the 8th, Deng reported to the Old Zha police station, which sent detectives Liang Chengyu and Bao Tan Li Hanzhang to the Zhenhua Hotel to book two rooms, one being room 102. They put the package in this room and wrote "Sun Fengji, resident of room 102" on the guest card. The other room, room 105, was for the detectives to lie in ambush. At 11:30 pm, Zhang A-san from Zhenjiang entered room 102, claiming to be visiting Sun. He opened the drawer, took the package, and was about to leave when the detectives in the next room rushed out and arrested him on the spot. Yesterday, he was sent to the Special District Court. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the details and requested a postponement to investigate accomplices. Judge Xu ordered the defendant to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Young Mrs. Gu Sues her Husband for Separation</h3>
<p>Another Woman on the Bed</p>
<p>The Father-in-Law is Deaf and Does Not Restrain Them</p>
<p>Enraged, She Sues for Separation</p>
<p>The Judge Tries to Mediate, but Fails</p>
<p>Gu Shoubai from Nanxun, residing at 40 Fanshi Lane, Mu'er Ming Road, has a son named Songgang, who is 25 years old. In the eleventh year of the Republic, his father arranged for him to marry Zhu Lianyun from Suzhou. Zhu is three years older than Songgang. They have been married for nine years and have four children, all lively and adorable, except for one who died young. Recently, Zhu has complained that her husband's behavior is improper and that he is extravagant. The millions of valuables she brought as a dowry have been almost entirely spent, and he still shows no remorse. At 11:30 am on the 30th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, Zhu returned home from outside and entered the bedroom. She suddenly saw a young woman on the bed, kissing Songgang. She was extremely angry but remained silent. Her husband, on the other hand, rebuked Zhu for disturbing their good dream. The father-in-law, Shoubai, pretended to be deaf and allowed his son to behave improperly without any family discipline. Zhu then took her eight-year-old eldest daughter, Wenwei, and moved to her mother's house at 41 Qingyuli, Xin Chongqing Road. She hired a lawyer to sue Gu Songgang in the Special District Court, requesting a decree of separation from Gu Songgang and that his father, Gu Shoubai, jointly bear the responsibility for alimony, paying 200 yuan per month for living expenses, depositing 30,000 yuan in cash in the bank as collateral, and compensating for the cost of pearls, gold, diamonds, and jewelry, amounting to 30,000 yuan, and that she be allowed to raise her eldest daughter, Wenwei. The Gu father and son were sued and hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to argue that the plaintiff had left on the 24th day of the sixth month of the lunar calendar under the pretext of returning to her home province to visit her sick mother and had not returned since. As the head of the family, Shoubai should provide for food and clothing. The plaintiff was instigated by others and demanded a separation for no reason. Shoubai had no legal obligation to support her, so there was no abandonment, etc. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Wenrong summoned the Songgang couple to court to confront each other. After hearing their respective statements, the court tried to mediate a reconciliation, but it was ineffective. The lawyers of both parties then began to debate. Finally, Judge Xu ordered that the judgment be postponed until the 13th.</p>

<h3>Recent News on the Demolition of Houses in Qingyun Lane</h3>
<p>External Municipal Government's Approval</p>
<p>Since the incident of White Russians demolishing houses and injuring people in Qingyun Lane on September 10th, Xu Xinliu and other five Chinese directors of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Concession took on the role of mediators. However, due to the ineffectiveness of the mediation, both parties resorted to litigation in court to seek a legal resolution. Therefore, the five Chinese directors stated that they would decline the responsibility of mediation because the case was under litigation. Since this dispute has been brought to the law, in principle, neither party should take any action until the legal process is over. It is heard that last month, the landlord, New Sassoon, sent a letter to mediator Xu Xinliu, stating that in order to implement the Municipal Council's plan to widen Tiantong Road and with the consideration of the Public Works Department, the land close to the road must be ceded to the Municipal Council in the near future. Therefore, in these few days, the company would definitely take "any necessary steps to prepare for the proceedings." Mr. Xu forwarded the letter to the Qingyun Lane Housing Association. Upon hearing the news, all the tenants of Qingyun Lane were alarmed, fearing that the foreign company would once again use the pretext of the Municipal Council's widening of the Tiantong Road surface to carry out a second violent demolition (because the south side of Qingyun Lane is directly on Tiantong Road). Therefore, they submitted a petition to the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang, and the Shanghai Municipal Government's Mayor Zhang, and sent a letter to the Municipal Council's Director General Edward, requesting protection and a firm stop to the landlord's repeated illegal oppression, awaiting the court's resolution. Now, the replies from Foreign Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Mayor Zhang of the Shanghai Municipal Government to the Qingyun Lane tenants have been obtained. Excerpts from the approval orders are as follows: Ministry of Foreign Affairs Storage Letter No. 22 Approval (All submitted documents have been examined. This case has previously been approved by the Ministry, which has sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government stating that it has successively sent letters to the Public Concession Municipal Council and the Special District Court to handle the matter according to the law, etc. You should be informed accordingly.) Shanghai Municipal Government No. 1075 Approval (The submission has been examined. Since this case has been accepted by the court, all parties must be bound by it. The tenants of the lane should wait for the court's resolution. This approval).</p>
<h3>French Concession Prohibits Reactionary Small Newspapers</h3>
<p>The French police authorities have recently discovered that small newspapers such as "Kuaidao Daily", "Hard News", "Asahi News", "Warrior Daily", "Daily News", "Xuguang Daily", "Spring and Autumn Warrior", "Qianxie", and "Gangtie" often contain reactionary articles, which are deemed to be detrimental to public security. They have been banned from being sold in the concession. Yesterday, the political department and all plainclothes detectives were instructed to pay attention.</p>

<h3>Regulations Affect Debt Raising</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce's Letter to the Ministry of Finance's Debt Raising Committee</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Bond Solicitation Committee of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "We acknowledge receipt of your letter instructing us to promote the sale of the 19th year Short-Term Post-War Treasury Bonds. We have recorded the letter and notified all affiliated trade associations to comply. We have now received a letter from the Intestine Industry Association stating that they received your letter from the Bond Solicitation Committee of the Ministry of Finance urging them to solicit 2,000 yuan of bonds and instructing them to pay the amount as scheduled. Upon receiving this, we dispatched personnel to solicit donations from various trades, but despite our efforts, the results were nil, and we are deeply ashamed. When we approached trades that were not members of the association to solicit donations, we were met with stern refusals, claiming that since they were not members, they would not bother to solicit. The solicitors had no choice but to turn away. If we earnestly persuaded trades that were members of the association to donate, the members would argue that the association's regulations, submitted to the supervising authorities for approval, require that all trades, whether members or not, must comply with the regulations. Since the Ministry of Industry and Commerce rejected the case, newspapers have spread rumors that such bad practices have no legal or mandatory force, and that they violate good customs. The long-standing customs of the trade have been completely negated by the Ministry's rejection, destroying the historical and time-honored principles. This has caused many unscrupulous merchants to take the opportunity to disrupt market prices and monopolize the market, leading to repeated disputes. The association has no way to resolve these issues, and the members suffer losses and cannot maintain their business or secure their livelihoods. How can they have the surplus to subscribe to bonds? The trade association only places excessive obligations on its members. What is the value of this association? They claimed that they had reported the facts to the affiliated associations for review and that the members' claims were true. However, the bonds are also used for post-war reconstruction, which is very important. Therefore, under the circumstances, it is difficult to proceed. We have no choice but to express our difficulties and ask you to look into the matter and forward the letter to the Bond Solicitation Committee of the Ministry of Finance so that they may understand the situation. We beg you to consider and implement this matter."</p>
<h3>Treatment of Female Silk Factory Workers</h3>
<p>Social Affairs Bureau Summons Both Parties and Mediation is Successful</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of salary increases for female workers in this city, the Social Affairs Bureau summoned representatives from both labor and management the other day and scheduled a formal mediation for yesterday afternoon. The management representatives present were Shen Huachen, Xu Yunjian, and Zhang Peishen (represented by Ling Xiao), and the labor representatives were Song Xiaorong, Lu Cuizhen, Wu Suzhen, and nine others. Regarding the issue of salary increases, it was originally decided during the questioning the other day that the female workers would cancel the holiday bonus and the application for salary increases would remain the same as before, with four increments. However, the other day (the 7th), the silk factory association convened a meeting, and the representatives of the factories collectively stated that the silk market was depressed and that those who were still operating were already struggling. They could not meet the demands of the female workers. Therefore, the three representatives who attended yesterday stated that they could not comply. However, the female workers argued that during the previous talks, they had already decided to make concessions and cancel the holiday bonus. The monthly salary increase application would remain the same as before, with four increments. The management suddenly refused to comply, and the representatives could not return to the union to report. Therefore, they persisted for a long time. In the end, Wang Bingcai of the Social Affairs Bureau adopted a compromise solution and decided to change the application for salary increases from four increments to two increments. The female workers, realizing the factory's difficulties, had no choice but to agree. The management representatives also respected the mediator's wishes and complied. A formal agreement was then signed and drafted as follows: (1) The wages of female workers in all silk factories in the city shall be temporarily calculated at 85% of the original amount. (2) The holiday bonus shall be temporarily canceled. (3) The salary increase (i.e., monthly bonus) to which female workers are entitled each month shall be temporarily given two increments (one increment for ten days, two increments for sixteen days. However, the labor party shall not cite this point as a precedent when wages are restored to their original state in the future). (4) When the factory's business improves, the labor party may request the restoration of the original wages, but the period for which wages are reduced shall be delayed until the end of May of the twentieth year. (5) The treatment of workers in double-shift factories is different from that of workers in single-shift factories. If there are any increases or decreases, they must be submitted to the government for approval separately. (6) This agreement shall take effect from November (New Sound News Agency).</p>
<h3>Change to National Calendar for Termination Dates</h3>
<p>Labor Contracts Stipulating Lunar Calendar Dates Should be Changed to National Calendar Dates</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Pen and Ink Trade Association yesterday, stating: "We acknowledge receipt of your letter stating that you have reviewed the case of Ermiaotang Yiji's termination of Hu Hansheng and others and requesting a change in interpretation to use the national calendar for handling. We have reported the matter to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. We have now received approval No. 442, which states that we have examined the approval statement. The bureau's instruction No. 2962 is in accordance with the Municipal Government's Bulletin No. 107, which states that after the expiration date of previous lunar calendar contracts, the date shall be calculated according to the national calendar, which is deferred by one month, which is a simple and easy method. This interpretation covers all civil contracts and is not limited to debt payments. If the labor and management conditions in this case are indeed difficult to implement in practice, both parties may amend them according to the national calendar. We hereby reply to your letter for your information and notification."</p>

<h3>Rescuing Minister Kong and Congratulatory Telegrams</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Industrial Association and the Chinese General Federation of Industry and Commerce telegraphed the National Government, saying to Chairman Chiang of the National Government: We humbly observe that since the completion of the unification of our National Government, political construction has been carried out in an orderly manner, and the main points of various policies have also been formulated. All of this relies on our Chairman's insight into politics and the appointment of virtuous and capable individuals. We humbly note that the current Minister of Industry, Kong Xiangxi, was initially promoted to the position of Minister of Industry in Guangdong due to his revolutionary achievements. Later, after the capital was moved south, he followed the Chairman in presiding over industry and commerce, dedicating his efforts to construction and safeguarding industrial administration. Hong Sheng and others have personally witnessed this and there is no need for further elaboration. Recalling when Minister Kong initially assumed the position of Minister of Industry, it was during the 17th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the overall situation in the Southeast was just stabilizing and the Northern Expedition had not yet succeeded. The Hubei rebellion was unprecedented in decades. Minister Kong shouldered heavy responsibilities and was able to handle them with ease. In less than three years in office, important industrial and commercial facilities such as commodity inspection have been established in order. Labor-capital cooperation has been established as a plan. National measurement has been planned for unification. Scientific school management has been engaged in promotion. Industrial and commercial visits have been set up as a bureau to handle them specially. All other development affairs related to industry can be practically implemented in an orderly manner. The interests of the party and the country are known to be done without fail, and the benefits of industrial administration are seen without fail to be raised. His transcendent thinking and sincere handling of affairs are truly outstanding talents of today. Yesterday, we received news from the capital that Minister Kong has submitted his resignation, deeply alarming us. We humbly believe that Minister Kong's integrity is incorruptible and his reasoning is detailed and clear. Therefore, although his tenure as minister has not been long, his achievements have been remarkable. At this time of national and social turmoil, when the suffering of the national industry has not yet been resolved, even if Minister Kong himself seeks to retire, the various industries in the national industrial sector cannot sit idly by and watch him retreat into seclusion, causing the progress of the entire plan to stagnate. We humbly request that our Chairman, bearing in mind the hardships, graciously comply with public opinion and promptly instruct the Executive Yuan to earnestly retain him to comfort the earnest expectations of the national industrial sector and urge Minister Kong to complete his unfinished work. It would be fortunate for the party and the country, and fortunate for the industry. Respectfully submitted by Chairman and Committee Members of the Chinese General Federation of Industry and Commerce: Liu Hongsheng, Zhu Jing'an, Lu Feibo Hong, Wang Boqi, Dai Gengxin, Wang Yaochen, Cai Shengbai, Nie Lusheng, Li Yanshi, Fan Xudong, Cai Jiansan, Qian Chengxu, Wu Yun Chu, Wang Yunwu, Shen Huachen, Qian Xuanqing, Shi Liangcai, etc.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the various industry regulation protection associations and various industry trade associations and the Committee for the Protection of Trade Regulations specially sent a telegram to the National Government regarding the news of the resignation of the newly appointed Minister of Industry. "To the Nanjing National Government: Recently, we read in the newspaper that the newly appointed Minister of Industry, Kong, has been suffering from a long illness and has requested resignation from your government. Since Minister Kong took office as Minister of Industry and Commerce, he has made many plans for industrial and commercial administration and reform. This year, he convened the Industrial and Commercial Conference, especially to adopt public opinion and eliminate the accumulated malpractices of the court and the public, opening up a path for cooperation between officials and the people. We hoped that after Minister Kong was transferred to the Ministry of Industry, he would implement the resolutions of the National Industrial and Commercial Conference one by one so that the industrial and commercial industry could gradually advance. However, his sudden announcement of retirement is extremely alarming. Therefore, we specially send a telegram to request your government to grant him leave so as to comfort the expectations of the industry and commerce and to value the sincerity of the love and support of the merchants and people. This telegram is respectfully submitted for your consideration." Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Municipal Industry Trade Association Committee for the Protection of Trade Regulations.</p>
<p>Regarding the transfer of Kong Xiangxi to the Ministry of Industry, Yu Jie and others from the Chinese cigarette factory industry sent a telegram to Kong on the 6th saying: "To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry: Benevolent administration is widespread, and industry and commerce are blessed. The new administration has been launched, and the industry is reviving. The industry is rejoicing. We deeply congratulate you." Jian Yu Jie, Jian Yingfu, and Lao Jingxiu of the Nanyang Tobacco Company. Ma Zi has heard that Minister Kong has expressed his resignation. Yesterday, he specially sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan to persuade him to stay and also sent a telegram to Kong to encourage him to do his best. Now, the text of the telegram is being sought out and recorded below. The telegram to the Executive Yuan said: "To the Executive Yuan of the Nanjing National Government: Recently, we read in the gazette that the newly appointed Minister of Industry, Kong, has resigned. Minister Kong, who previously served as Minister of Industry and Commerce, has protected the industry and commerce and cared for the hardships of the merchants. His virtuous administration is well-known and public opinion is in agreement. At this time when the world is at peace and the period of tutelage has begun, it is especially necessary to revitalize the industry in order to cultivate the national strength and recover the rights and interests. The plans of the old and mature cannot be hastily unloaded. We beg you to grant retention. The future of the industry will be deeply grateful." Respectfully submitted by the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association. The telegram to Minister Kong said: "To Minister Kong, the newly appointed Minister of Industry in Nanjing: Previously, we read in the gazette that you were pleased to be appointed to the Ministry of Industry and celebrated the fact that you had found the right person. Now we hear of your resignation and are deeply attached. Previously, your Excellency served as Minister of Industry and Commerce, and your virtuous administration was well-known and praised by the world. Our country has been unsettled in many places for many years, and the market has been declining. Now, fortunately, the overall situation is unified and the world is at peace. The revitalization of the industry is especially urgent. We beg you to comply with public opinion and do your best so that the industry can be revitalized and the country can be enriched and strengthened. We cannot help but express our urgent anticipation."

All the factories of the Association are waiting for your care and maintenance. There is no one but you. We respectfully send a telegram of congratulations. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Yarn Factory Association.</p>
<p>The Exchange Federation: To Minister Kong of the Ministry of Industry: We respectfully heard that you were appointed to the Ministry of Industry, enriching the country and benefiting the people. We respectfully admire your grand plans and pay homage from afar. We only send a telegram of congratulations and hope for your kind consideration. Respectfully submitted by the Shanghai Exchange Federation.</p>
<h3>Abolition of Exorbitant Taxes on Sichuan Silk to be Implemented</h3>
<p>Reply from the Ministry of Finance to the National Federation of Commerce</p>
<p>Yesterday, the National Federation of Commerce received a reply from the Ministry of Finance, No. 11491, stating: "We have received your submission. Upon investigation, the various military forces in Sichuan Province collect miscellaneous taxes on silk cocoons in their respective defense zones. The cost of each box of silk is only about 600 yuan, but the tax is as high as 120-130 yuan, resulting in excessive costs and complete losses. If no measures are taken to seek relief urgently, Sichuan silk will decline day by day, which is crucial to the livelihood and security of the people of Sichuan Province. Before the implementation of the abolition of levies in the province, all exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes in the defense zones of the province should be appropriately reduced or exempted in order to save it. This Ministry has telegraphed the Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy to promptly instruct the commanders of the 21st, 28th, and 29th Armies of Sichuan Province to comply and implement, and to abolish the newly established Jiangfang Import Tax in Chongqing first, in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants. You are hereby informed. This is the order."</p>
<h3>Special Commissioners for Special Tax Inspection Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Inspect Six Provinces</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the preparation for the collection of special taxes, the Special Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance of Nanjing specially transferred eight members, including Pan Xueyu, from the General Tax Office to Beijing. A few days ago, Zhang Fuyun, the director of the Special Tax Office, convened a meeting at the Customs Office, and everyone agreed that in order to facilitate the progress of tax collection, it is necessary to start with on-site investigation. Therefore, the eight members, including Pan, and several section chiefs and staff members of the Special Tax Office were all ordered to go to the six provinces of Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to personally and accurately investigate the situation of local product tax collection, with silk, tea, paper, wood, porcelain, and oil as the main items. The assigned commissioners have already departed for their respective inspection areas. The dispatched commissioners are: Pan Xueyu for Jiangxi, Li Pengshou and Jiang Chengsheng for Jiangsu, and Gu Weijing, section chief of the Special Tax Office. Zhang Yongnian for Hunan, Qiu Daoqi for Hubei, Ma Qishan and Wang Huamin for Zhejiang, and Zuo Zhangjin for Anhui. Mr. Pan took the Jianghua wheel to Jiujiang from Shanghai last night. The reporter met him on the wheel and inquired about his itinerary. It is expected that he will return to Beijing to report at the end of this month. Director Zhang intends to officially establish the Special Tax Office on January 1 next year. However, there is no regulation on the inspection date for one week or two weeks. The focus is always on being detailed and accurate. The inspection work is heavy and it is difficult to hide things in ten days or so.</p>
<h3>News of the International Road Construction Conference</h3>
<p>The International Road Construction Association held its sixth annual meeting in Washington, D.C. on October 6 this year.

The Chinese representatives Zhao Linghua participated in the first group, while the two representatives Chen and Sun set off with the second group. The representative sent by the Liaoning Provincial Government to the meeting to receive the letter of appointment was delayed and did not participate in the meeting. Daily reports were published and the results were very satisfactory. The International Road Construction Association has held six annual joint conferences before and after. Our country has never officially sent representatives to participate. This year, the conference was held in Washington, D.C. Our country, which was in the midst of a civil war, was still able to send a large number of representatives to the meeting. All countries believed that this was a good sign and showed that China had made progress in road construction recently. It is heard that the American Commercial Counselor to China, An Lide, and the Deputy Counselor, Gao Erde, invited our country's representatives to participate in this conference, and the Commercial Commissioner, Shi Nanfang, was the most active. He has received a telegram from the government praising him.</p>

<h3>Yu Shun and Jiang Xin Vessels Run Aground</h3>
<p>It is common for ships to have accidents due to shallow water on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The Yu Shun vessel of the China Merchants Bureau was transporting goods to Wuhan this time. When it arrived at Hankou, the river water was receding greatly. The vessel was anchored in the heart of the river, but the passengers demanded that the vessel move to the dock for the sake of picking up goods. The shipowner initially refused, but the passengers said that the riverbank had 25 feet of draft and could be moved. Unexpectedly, the Yu Shun vessel ran aground during the process of moving. At that time, there was no towing vessel in Hankou, so the Yu Shun was stranded for a day and night until yesterday when the Lijian vessel from Changsha arrived in Hankou and sent it to rescue. The goods in the vessel are being unloaded. It is expected that the vessel can be rescued today. Also, the Jiang Xin vessel transported soldiers from Beijing to Yangluo this time to suppress bandits. After the soldiers landed in Yangluo, the Jiang Xin set off for Hankou. When it entered the Yangtze River in Hankou, it was also at low tide. The vessel ran aground on the shoal because the vessel was still loaded with a lot of cargo and had not been unloaded, so it was difficult to tow. Yesterday, it was reported that the cargo was being lightered first to reduce the load, and then towed today. The hulls of the two vessels are generally not badly damaged, and the passengers are getting on and off safely.</p>
<h3>Special News from the Yangtze River Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>Hunan rice can be transported. This year, Hunan rice has a bumper harvest and the provincial government has lifted the ban on transporting it to other provinces. Afterwards, because the passport fee for Hunan rice leaving the province was 5 yuan per stone, the previous procurement was temporarily stopped for a long time. Now the Hunan authorities have agreed to relax the restrictions. Yesterday, the various wheel companies in this port received a telegram from Changsha saying that Hunan rice can be loaded and transported in large quantities to Shantou and Guangdong, and then transferred to Shanghai by boat. However, because the river water in Hunan is shallow and cannot be transported directly, shallow-water barges have been dispatched to load and transport Hunan rice leaving the province.</p>
<p>Cargo Accumulated in Nanxun due to Water Transport: Due to the Communist Party's disturbances in Jiangxi, cargo along the Nanxun Road has been suspended for a long time, and the accumulated cargo has been increasing day by day. This time, the Central Government sent troops to Jiangxi to suppress the Communists, and the area between Nanchang and Jiujiang has been cleared. Merchants are eager to transport the accumulated cargo to Shanghai. However, the Nanxun Road lacks vehicles and needs to be transported urgently. Therefore, Jiangxi merchants negotiated with Shanghai Sanbei China Merchants and other wheel companies and decided that from the 10th of this month, cargo from Nanchang and other areas will be transported by waterway to Nanxun. Special barge shifts will be added at Hukou to transport cargo to Shanghai. The Sanbei Company has complied with the requirements of the Jiangxi merchants and has telegraphed Xuan'an Yang'an and other vessels to start the Hukou Nanxun shift from today. China Merchants has also dispatched shifts to start sailing to Shanghai to transport Nanchang cargo, which has been restored today.</p>
<p>Henan Tobacco Leaves Arrived in Shanghai: 30,000 pieces of Henan Xuchang tobacco leaves transported to Shanghai, which were detained in Hankou, have been released after Yu Qiaqing and others telegraphed Hubei for consultation. The first batch of 5,000 pieces has been transported to Shanghai by the Sanbei China Merchants Bureau and unloaded in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>Compensation for the Feihu Vessel Has Been Allocated</h3>
<p>180,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Feihu vessel of the Sanbei Company was rammed by a naval vessel in front of the China Merchants Bureau Wharf in Hankou on February 23 this year and sunk in the Yangtze River. Afterwards, the Sanbei Company sent technicians and workers to Hankou to salvage it for three months, but it could not be salvaged. The insurance company said that the accident of the vessel was outside the scope of ordinary beaches and claimed that it was not insured for military risks and refused to pay compensation after several negotiations. Until last month, because there was no hope of salvage, the rescue was abandoned. Yu Qiaqing, the owner of Sanbei, immediately submitted a request to the headquarters and the Navy Department to compensate for the loss of the vessel in order to maintain the capital. Yu entered Beijing several times to contact Chairman Chiang and the naval authorities, and now it has been completely resolved. The headquarters has recognized the loss of the Feihu vessel at 180,000 yuan, which has been received by Yu. It has been decided to build a new vessel to replace it.</p>
<h3>Topics for Discussion at the Pacific International Relations Conference</h3>

<h3>Measures for Sunday Holidays with Pay for Daily Workers in Japanese Factories</h3>
<p>Amendment by the Central Executive Committee</p>
<p>Notification by the Civil Training Committee</p>
<p>The Mass Training Committee of the Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has issued a notice to the labor and capital representatives of various factories in the city regarding the announcement of matters and cases. The notice of the Central Executive Committee No. 17080 states that regarding the factory's annual shutdown dates and the measures for Sunday holidays with pay for daily workers, the 70th Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee previously resolved that the factory's annual shutdown dates should be based on the revolutionary memorial days and memorial ceremonies, which are January 1, March 12, March 29, July 9, October 10, and November 12, and one more day for May 1 Labor Day, for a total of seven days. The measures for Sunday holidays with pay for daily workers (workers whose wages are calculated on a daily basis) "should be handled in accordance with the legally effective group agreements or work contracts. If there is no agreement, it should be determined according to whether the work is long-term or short-term." After the announcement of the above measures, various factories in various places have different situations in employing workers and the method of paying wages on weekdays, and there is no definite standard for long-term and short-term employment in fact, so it is difficult to handle. After inquiring about the opinions of the three departments of Industry, Commerce, Transportation, and Railway from the Central Training Department, the amendment was submitted to the Central Executive Committee for discussion at the 115th Standing Committee. It was agreed that since there is no definite standard for long-term and short-term employment in fact, it should not be used as the basis for whether to pay wages. Even if there is no formal contract between the factory and the workers, there should be some agreement on such issues at the time of employment. The original resolution on those without an agreement is not necessary, so it was resolved to amend the section on the measures for Sunday holidays with pay for daily workers in the original resolution of the 70th Standing Committee as follows: "...As for the measures for Sunday holidays with pay for daily workers (workers whose wages are calculated on a daily basis), it should be handled in accordance with the legally effective group agreements or work agreements." The amendment of the resolution should be notified to all party departments for their information and to be forwarded to their respective subordinates for their information. In addition to informing the Social Affairs Bureau by letter, all labor and capital parties in the city's factories must be informed.</p>
<h3>The Final Expression of the Pawnshop Industry Workers</h3>
<p>Resubmit to the Municipal Government for Mediation of Disputes</p>
<p>Send Representatives to the Party Department to Petition</p>
<p>Because the requirements of all members of the pawnshop industry workers' union for the modification of treatment conditions by the capitalists have not been resolved for a long time, a members' congress was held on the evening of the 5th of this month. The atmosphere at the congress was mainly to go on strike. After the representative of the Municipal Party Department, Zhang Yaoming, tried his best to dissuade them, it was decided to implement a go-slow protest this Friday. Yesterday, the workers' union resubmitted to the municipal government for a final mediation and sent three representatives, Wang Ganchen, Cheng Zijun, and Deng Dunli, to the Municipal Party Department to petition at 11:00 a.m. the day before yesterday. Wang Lide of the Civil Training Committee met them, and the result was that the various sections of the petition would be handled after the Party Department meeting made a decision.</p>
<h3>The Procuratorate Scheduled to Burn Items</h3>
<p>Recently, the amount of opium being transported into Shanghai has been increasing day by day. Some unscrupulous merchants disregard local security and often smuggle and leak opium, morphine, and red pills and other drugs in order to profit from them. They gather people to smoke or sell them, causing harm. The Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate has been vigorously enforcing the ban on opium and has been doing its best to handle it. Opium, morphine, and other drugs have been seized and routinely burned. It has now been decided to burn all the smoking paraphernalia seized from January to June of the 19th year at 2:00 p.m. on the 13th of this month in the open space next to the west side of the court. It is estimated that in the six months from January to June of the 19th year, there will be 5,301 taels and 5 qian of opium soil, 49 jin and 4 taels of opium dross, 112 jin of red pills, 31 taels and 6 qian of morphine, 8 jin and 6 taels of heroin, and 2,925 pieces of other smoking paraphernalia. It is also heard that letters were sent to various agencies yesterday inviting them to send representatives to the site to supervise the destruction of the tickets in order to show prudence.</p>

<h3>Yang Guanshang Disappeared in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Demanding 10,000 Yuan for Ransom</p>
<p>Yang Guanshang, a native of Wuxi, 49 years old, was formerly the manager of the Yikang Yarn Factory in the port. He has a wife, children, and meager assets. He is quite weak and enjoys socializing. Yang came to Shanghai at the end of last month to pay his respects at the funeral of the Xue family. He took a car and stayed at the Zhenhua Hotel on Fourth Ma Road in the Public Concession. Then, on the 3rd of this month, he went to congratulate his close friend surnamed Sun, and then suddenly disappeared. Because Yang did not return for many days and there was no news, his family immediately sent someone to Shanghai to look for him without success, so they were even more panic-stricken. Unexpectedly, at about 9:00 p.m. the night before last, when the person was searching around, he suddenly received a quick letter from Yang's home, stating that the family had received a letter requiring them to prepare 10,000 yuan to go to a certain port to negotiate. After receiving the letter, the person returned to Wuxi early yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>The Huishi Police Station Continues to Capture Bandits</h3>
<p>The Huishi Police Station previously arrested a bandit named Bi Yongcheng. Under interrogation, he confessed that his accomplices were hiding in the countryside west of Shanghai. Therefore, the detective Shang Wu led detectives to the village late at night on a certain day to arrest them. There were many dogs in the village, and they barked when they heard footsteps in the middle of the night. The bandits who were hiding heard the dogs barking and knew that strangers had arrived or that it was bad for them, so they fled in the dark. Although the detectives saw dark shadows, they were not familiar with the village roads and could not pursue them, so they were allowed to escape. The night before last, they went to arrest them again and successively captured Song Wenyi, Xue Luyu, Zai Wenfang, and Sun Xiaolun, all of whom were Jianghuai migrants. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Special District Local Court for interrogation by Judge Sun. They were ordered to be detained and tried together with Bi Yongcheng.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor of the News Department of the Shen Bao Newspaper,</p>
<p>I was surprised to read the news item in your newspaper's "News" column on December 9, which reported on the rickshaw pullers in the Public Concession protesting the fare increase. The article stated that Xia Renqi, a representative of the district party headquarters, also attended to provide guidance. I was very surprised because I, Renqi, did not attend as a representative of the district party headquarters. I was only there as an individual to listen and took the opportunity to give a speech on the Three Principles of the People to promote it more widely. I did not participate in any opinions on the anti-increase matters of the rickshaw pullers. I think there must be a misunderstanding in the interview. I am writing to request a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Xia Renqi</p>
<p>December 9</p>

<h3>A Laughing Matter</h3>
<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Young Man (at a banquet in a large hotel, after the banquet is over, sees the waiters standing in a row, each holding his coat and hat, waiting) — Seeing them so attentive, like serving upper-class guests, it seems that I can't save a few pennies on this small bill.</p>
<p>A Waiter — Sir, here is your overcoat (helps the young man put it on, and the young man gives him a two-cent ticket).</p>
<p>Another Waiter — Sir, here is your hat (hands it to the young man with both hands, and the young man gives him another two-cent ticket).</p>
<p>Another Waiter — Sir, here are your gloves (hands them to the young man with both hands).</p>
<p>The young man hesitated for a long time and looked at his worn-out gloves) — These... these gloves are not mine. It seems they are not worth even two cents, so you can keep them.</p>
<p>Diner (asking the waiter) — Do you have all kinds of dishes prepared in such a large restaurant?</p>
<p>Waiter — Everything is available, sir, you can order anything you like.</p>
<p>Diner — Then how many varieties are there?</p>
<p>Waiter — There are many varieties. We have four or five different names for each dish.</p>
<p>Father (to his son) — I am a person who has been able to strive since I was a child. By the time I was twenty-five, I was able to stand on my own and be my own master.</p>
<p>Son — But in that year, you married mother and cancelled your master qualifications, didn't you?</p>
<h3>Snippets on the International Race Walk</h3>
<p>— Shen Zhenchao</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Race Walk covers more than fifty li and is held annually. This is the sixteenth time. This year's event was held on the morning of the 7th. The participants were from six countries: England, Ireland, France, Russia, Portugal, and our China. More than fifty contestants participated. As a result, our country's Zhou Yu Yu and other gentlemen worked hard and bravely won the individual and team championships. Spectators were delighted and overjoyed. Everyone was happy and proud.</p>
<p>The Grandstand Was Full for the First Time The grandstand of the racetrack is crowded with people when watching the grand horse race. This is not surprising. However, it is really a new record to see the International Race Walk so crowded, because the destination of the remote fifty-li journey is in front of the grandstand. Everyone wants to see who will win the championship.</p>
<p>Sacrificing the Warm Quilt to Watch the Race Walk The race walk starts at 8:00 in the morning and ends at the grandstand. The fastest is about 10:30. On weekdays, this time is when Shanghai people are having sweet dreams, but the 7th happened to be a Sunday. To see the athletes' skills, they had to sacrifice their sleep and get up early. There were also many ladies, most of whom did not apply makeup, leaving the true face of beauty. From this, we can also see the enthusiasm of Shanghai people for sports.</p>
<p>Red and White Flags Waving in the Wind The grass in front of the grandstand is the finish line of the race walk. On both sides of the iron fence are flags. The left side is red and the right side is white. All the way to Ma Huo Road Gate, the red and white reflect each other with the green grass that has not withered, which is especially beautiful.</p>
<p>The Ranking Board Announces the Itinerary The race members' itinerary in the field is reported by car at any time and posted on the board. When it was almost 10 o'clock, the board said that China's Zhou Yuyu was the first to reach Hongqiao Road, which was a great comfort to everyone.</p>
<p>Bicycles Participate in the Race Every contestant has a leading staff member who drives a car or rides a bicycle. These fifty contestants are followed by countless bicycle riders. It can be seen that those who are anxious to win are following with bicycles. These dozens of bicycles are no different from joining the competition.</p>
<p>Crowd Celebrates Early Glimpses of People At the intersection of Ma Huo Road and the grandstand, there is a foreign platform. From there, it is very clear to see Weihaiwei Road. The crowds are on this foreign platform. The crowds on both sides of Weihaiwei Road are also crowded and crowded. When it was almost 10:30, cars came one after another. Everyone knew it was coming. There were also those who came to report in advance, saying that Zhou Yuyu was the first. The car left and a large number of bicycles came. So everyone believed it even more. Sure enough, Mr. Zhou shook his hands and feet like a musical beat, and came gracefully. There were about hundreds of people following him. The welcomers on the foreign platform shouted loudly. Mr. Zhou raised his hands to answer, as if saying that I must use it to comfort the people of the country.</p>
<p>People on People Compete to See Heroes After that, Mr. Hou Genren from our country also arrived, in addition to the individual, our country's team championship was six out of ten. Everyone's efforts were indeed raising their eyebrows and cheering for the championship. The audience cheered like thunder. Zhou was surrounded by people on the award platform, so that no water could leak through. There were those who went up on other people's backs to see what Mr. Zhou was like. And the ladies crowded in the crowd, fearing that they would not get a glimpse. When he came out, he followed him again. Mr. Zhou smiled and returned with his many prizes.</p>
<p>Celebrating Success, Sino-Western Duet A military band from the British Army Green Howards was specially invited to the field to add to the fun. When the awards were presented, the military music was melodious to celebrate our success. At the same time, the Chinese also sang loudly. The Sino-Western duet was a beautiful event in the competition.</p>
<p>Wishing Effort to the Old and Young Heroes Among the more than fifty contestants, there were old and young. The Englishman Ross (individual participation) had white hair and must be very old. When he reached the end point, he still worked hard to compete with another teenager, and he took the lead, which is deeply admirable. And Mr. Gong Jintao from our country is only seventeen years old. How should we encourage ourselves in the face of this pair of old and young heroes?</p>
<h3>Why Is the Wang Rong Joint European Painting Exhibition Unprecedented?</h3>
<p>— Xin Qin</p>
<p>Because they can exhaust the art and all the attached ingenuity.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Wang Yachen Rong Joint European Painting Exhibition. The reporter made a special trip to observe it for two hours. Because of his superficial understanding of painting, he dared not comment. Now, he only briefly describes one or two points based on his personal views in order to prove why this meeting is unprecedented. I think it will be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>Special Venue The venue is the Club of China, a model of newly built Western-style houses. The interior and exterior layout and decoration are extremely rich and magnificent. The three floors are full of precious paintings, which are the culmination of ancient and modern art. It is competent and pleasant. This venue does not fail this meeting, and this meeting does not fail this venue.</p>
<p>Numerous Masterpieces Mr. Wang has always emphasized practicality in his paintings, which cannot be compared with those who wield their pens casually. Mrs. Rong happens to be like-minded with Mr. Wang. The heavenly couple traveled to Europe and traveled north together. They worked together to collect the treasures of ancient and modern art in Europe and the West to share with the Chinese people. There are many dazzling and beautiful things. Who would say it is not appropriate to call them masterpieces?</p>
<p>Outstanding Frames Painters have two things that are most hesitant about: one is the frame, and the other is the printing plate. The frame is especially important for exhibitions. Mr. Wang seems to be aware of this, so half of the frames he uses seem to be brought back from Europe and the West. It is said that half of them are specially entrusted to Hongyuan Art Casting Company in this city to produce. The company was founded by the famous sculptor Zhang Chenbo. Zhang also made a great contribution to the excellence of this frame.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang's Stage Debut</h3>
<p>— Lao Zhuo</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang returned to China with honors from the United States this autumn. When he passed through Shanghai, the grand theater owner planned to keep him for a performance for a certain period of time, but it was stopped because of the hot weather. Then, it was agreed to wait until winter. Now that the time is approaching Xiaochun, the sound of watching Mei in Shanghai is again full of ears. The evening of the 4th was the date for Mr. Mei's entourage to appear on stage. Therefore, the various dramas I watched are briefly recorded as follows: Wang Huifang, such as Rouge Tiger, Huifang's transformation of Xiaosheng has begun, and it seems that she has lost her original ability. Recalling more than ten years ago, Huifang's post-Dan sound vibrated for a while. Although she is getting older, her charm still exists. If she still performs her old masterpieces, it is still worth watching. Jiang Miaoxiang's Yue Family Village, Jiang's Xiaosheng has been transformed for many years and deeply rooted in the shell. In this drama, being beaten by his mother is like a little boy and girl's squealing, which is very good. Zhu Guifang's Taking Jinling, Guifang is famous for her expertise in playing with her hands. I haven't seen her for two years. I feel that her skills are more convenient and clean than before. Tan Fuying's Beating Drums and Cursing Cao, Fuying has also not been seen for two years. Her voice is louder than before, and her spirit is more invigorated. Mian Zhi is striving to rope his ancestors. Wang Fengqing's Wenzhaoguan's entrance shake plate, the three words (tiger's den) in the second sentence are extraordinarily upright, and the Xipi Yuan plate (hating King Ping's immorality), a section of the cry of the head (father and mother are frightened) and the Erhuang Yuan plate (there are things in my heart that are hard to close my eyes) are like knocking gold and jade. The singing method of the whole play is pure Wang school, but it is a pity that he is getting old and has the pain of being unable to do what he wants. The big axis Mei Lanfang's Su San Qi Jie's sound (bitter) in the curtain has already resounded throughout the hall. Every section of the song is excellent, and it is like good words like pearls strung together. Each tune is also gradually turned to a high pitch, and the clear tune is far and wide, permeating the whole hall. It is not that he has returned from the United States and absorbed the overseas air to have such a state. As for his generous behavior and delicate workmanship, it is only the rest. Xiao Changhua's comedic performance of the escorts is also greatly helpful to the performance of the play. The audience is amazed.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Seeing Bi Xiufang's Paintings and Calligraphy</h3>

<p>Chinese art, only calligraphy and painting are worshiped by foreigners. Therefore, countries have exhibitions. Since the Tang and Song dynasties, famous painters have emerged in large numbers. The plum blossoms, orchids, bamboos, and chrysanthemums they painted each have their own specialty. Those who do not have superb calligraphy and outstanding character are not easy to write. Such as Zhu Yuanzhang of Song Dynasty painted plum blossoms, Zheng Suonan painted orchids, Su Dongpo painted bamboo, and Xu Zhongsi painted chrysanthemums. These are all obvious to the eyes. Although there are many later starters, they do not break away from the stereotypes of these four masters. There are occasional casual wielders of the pen, which are even more inferior and not worth mentioning. Today, after seeing Bi Xiufang's calligraphy, true grass, official script, and seal script are combined. His unique running script is based on Zhu Cai Su Huang's above the two old men, which is lovable. Those who know him think that it will be passed on in the future, so the hall pictures, couplets, and fan faces are sold out. The plum blossoms, orchids, bamboos, and chrysanthemums he paints also come from the wonderful place in calligraphy. The strokes use the ancient method, and the supplements of the stones are also positioned properly. The ink is divided into five colors, and the inscription is also fresh and beautiful. As a result, the painters are also too busy to order paintings. I feel relaxed and happy here, and I deeply admire Mr. Bi's decades of hard work and solitary work. This achievement is admired by people from all walks of life, and I cannot help but feel it and say it.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes in Southeast Asia (95)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On the tenth day, Zhong Yu Gong led Yu to travel. He rested at the station without a seat. Zhong then called two Burmese people to make them get up and let us two sit. Also, a person was lying on a long bench in his park. He sat on it and gently hit it to wake him up and let me sit. Yu did not agree with this, thinking that it was not a forgiving way. If this happened in China, it would be inevitable to fight for a seat. He replied that this place emphasizes class. As long as we dress in Western clothes and speak English, we can ask Burmese people to give up their seats anywhere. If we meet officials or detectives in the countryside, we must speak English, and everything will be easy. Yu thought that the Burmese people did not dare to compete with others because of the fall of their country. It is also the habit of dyeing India and other places. India originally had four classes, so Buddha transformed it with equal law, but it has not been removed and still exists today. This law cannot be implemented in China in one step, which shows that Chinese people have a true spirit of equality.</p>
<p>The British have the military and political power in Burma, followed by the Indians who have the economic power. India is a large country in Central Asia with many intelligent people and superior business skills, followed by Westerners, and then by Chinese who also have economic power. The next are Burmese officials and merchants, and those who work as coolies belong to the 吉能 people of India. Those who pull rickshaws are all 吉能 people who are black, but the Burmese people in the countryside live in thatched huts and are very poor. According to people, sometimes they don’t have food and only eat porridge to get by.</p>
<p>In the past, geography books said that people in high places are lazy and love to gossip. Burmese people are especially so. They like to give alms and are poor. Most of Siam is also the same. Because of their belief in Buddhism, believing in Buddhism easily makes people lazy, so lazy people mostly believe in Buddhism and like to give alms. The method of giving alms is also worthless. Burmese rich people often give dozens or hundreds of dollars in food items to the Buddha at a time, but they discard them after giving them and do not eat them, thinking that those who offer to the Buddha should not eat them again. This kind of waste of material resources is one of the ten major causes of poverty for Burmese people, which is strange. Also, they do not know how to be frugal and save money. They love to be happy. When they have money, everyone gathers to eat, and the rich give alms without hesitation. Wan Hui Shi said that the Burmese people are Buddhist communists who value wealth and respect. If they know their customs and can speak Burmese, they can easily be welcomed wherever they go. Everyone loves to give alms, so there is communication between the rich and the poor. Their outlook on life is very casual. Because everyone has been a monk, they feel that the family is also an ephemeral thing, unlike Westerners and Chinese who are stingy and contemptuous.</p>
<h3>Warmth in My Heart (332)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Diligently Asks for Words from the Teacher; Heroic Women Talk About War at a Brothel Banquet</p>
<p>The old year has passed, and spring has returned. It is again a new year, a new scene. At that time, the government was promoting the use of the National Calendar. By the end of the old calendar and the beginning of the new year, it was still the same as before. The rich people in Beijing hid in their villas in Tianjin, because they could gamble heavily in the New Year. Those who stayed in Beijing also enjoyed their Lunar New Year entertainment. As for Shanghai, every household set off firecrackers and every place had peach talismans. A whole month was spent in entertainment. The National Calendar's New Year's Day was just a few red newspapers with stories published by the newspapers, and a few red paper lanterns hanging on the government offices and temples, blowing in the wind and rain, just to show the scene. Time flies quickly. In a blink of an eye, the gongs and drums of the New Year have stopped, and the lanterns of the Lantern Festival are also fading. Those brothels have also reached the point of turning around. Green Ripple was scheduled to enter the venue on the eighteenth day of the first month, and her name was changed to Green Ripple. On that day, Zuo Shichen was going to fulfill his obligation to eat all the opening banquets. Not only that, but he also dragged two friends, Long Ziyun and Lin Fanzi. After Zuo Shichen told them about it, they were both willing to help. Long Ziyun originally appreciated Yi's gentle and quietness, saying that this child is promising. Lin Fanzi was originally indifferent. Everyone was happy for a while, and he was also willing to join in the fun. He was a good socializer by nature, and that kind of invitation only had obligations and no rights, and had a bit of a supportive nature. Everyone seemed to have a meaning of "Who is not as good as me in doing good?" He only fulfilled his obligations this time, and there was no precedent for the next time. Therefore, everyone was very happy. They arranged the days. The first day was Zuo Shichen, the second day was Long Ziyun, and the third day was Lin Fanzi. Naturally, Long and Lin were present on the day Zuo Shichen invited guests, and Zuo Shichen was also present on the day Long and Lin invited guests. However, in addition, they invited many slightly polite people. If someone in the audience that day praised this little master, they would say that turning a hall and singing well is like the co-examiners of the rural examination in the past getting a good scroll and rushing to recommend it. Sure enough, there were also those who did not enter the eyes of the chief examiner, but most of them could be admitted. After three days of inviting guests, Green Ripple gained seven or eight households. The place in the small garden used to be inhabited by a Western merchant, and there were some flowers and trees, but it was not easy to find tranquility in the noise in Shanghai. The natural trend of Fuzhou Road and Hankou Road gradually moved to the west. The small garden had long been surrounded by restaurants and singing halls, and it was no longer quiet in the noise. They simply sold the small garden to another Western merchant to build their brothel houses. So that small garden has become a swallow's nest and oriole's nest, and the furnishings in the halls of Shanghai are the most annoying, all the same decoration. From that one to this one, they are all the same type.</p>

<h3>Will the Financial Gold Rush Continue Unabated?</h3>
<p>Truly frightening… another jump of thirteen taels</p>
<p>Miserable… for the general bears</p>
<p>Breaking the thirty-tael barrier! On December 9th, the gold price once again saw a shockingly high price, presenting a new record unprecedented in history. It surged past the 630-tael mark, a fierce rise of over ten taels. Like ten thousand horses galloping, the momentum was overwhelming. The opening market had a difference of eight taels. However, the pace was swift, with only slight retreats of one or two taels. The overseas silver market's decline slightly eased, showing a slight rebound. Yet, the gold price managed to hold its ground. It was rumored that a certain bank had purchased a substantial amount of spot goods the day before. Upon hearing this, fellow traders were in high spirits. Consequently, major players like Fuchang, Xinxing, Yongheng, Taikang, and Run enthusiastically bought in. However, Shunli, Tongtai, Changyong, and Yongfeng, among others, were selling off, causing the price to soar, rising eight taels. The foreign exchange also narrowed by half a point, and the domestic market was also quite strong. However, there seemed to be more sellers at noon, leading to a slight decrease of one or two taels. In the afternoon, the Dalian gang and Yongheng Yuancheng Yong, among others, aggressively bought in, mainly because the demand for drafts was even more strained, and the market's edge was truly astonishing. However, the storm was turbulent, with rapid advances and retreats, resulting in a fluctuation of four taels. By the close, the total increase was seven taels. Looking back, the number of transactions was still not large, and the amount per transaction was small. Fellow traders generally maintained a cautious approach, engaging carefully for fear of danger. Ultimately, the peak was reached at 633 taels and five qian. Observing the situation, it is feared that a new era may reappear in the future. However, the bears are greatly discouraged, bearing tremendous pressure, and it is said that large transactions this morning will still decline.</p>
<p>Frenzied jumps and plunges, alarming and soul-stirring. The initial opening price for January gold futures rose slightly by one tael and one qian, calculated at 621 taels and six qian (gross trading rose from about 20 taels to 21 or 22 taels, with Fuchang, Zhifeng Yong, and hedgers being the first to take action and chase the price). Although the large transactions were long, up sixteen points of a cent daily, the US price rose sixteen points of a cent, and the silver price rose by a quarter, and private telegrams also added a quarter. It was learned that a certain firm and a certain bank had transacted cash the day before, but this was kept secret. It was not until yesterday morning that it was discovered, so the market sentiment suddenly peaked. Subsequently, some retail investors sold, and the price fell back to 20 taels and zero qian. However, the buying interest from Fuchang, Dadecheng, and Zhifeng Yong was strong, so the price rose to 23 taels. As for foreign exchange, it was also firm.

It was estimated that Tongtaichang, Shunli, and Yongfeng all sold, while Bingxing, Xieyu, and Yuancheng Yong had varying entries and exits. Wanxing, Taikangrun, Fuchang, Yuanheng, Dadecheng, Yu Da, Xinxing, and Yongheng all entered. In the afternoon, Yongheng, Yuancheng Yong, Xieyu, Dadecheng, and Yuanmaoyong all entered. Shunli, Wanxing, and Taihengyuan also bought. Bingxing, Taikangrun, Yongfeng, and Yu Da exited. Items entered and exited rapidly, but each company's entries and exits were unusually complex.

In the afternoon, a total of 1,000 transactions were sold, while 1,600 to 1,700 transactions were bought. The Guangdong gang still had few transactions.</p>
<h3>The Foreign Exchange Market Exhibits Exceptional Superiority</h3>

HSBC's listed foreign exchange rates initially remained unchanged, with only the Japanese exchange rate increasing by 1.25, calculated at 1 tael, 3 qian, and 7.5 fen. Around 10:50, all exchange rates suddenly narrowed by half a point, with British gold narrowing by 1.25, currently at 1 shilling, 5 pence, and 75.

The general bears were thoroughly defeated, with the market advancing rapidly. Therefore, the exchange rates were sharp from the start, and even more so later. Near and distant British gold futures suddenly broke through and entered 1 shilling and 6 pence. Compared to the previous day, British gold narrowed by 2.5, US dollars narrowed by half a yuan, and Japanese gold increased by 1 fen and 625. The supply and demand from Chinese merchants differed. The bulls slightly pushed in, and the bears were forced to replenish their positions, but there were no large-scale inflows or outflows. Approximately 300,000 pounds of British gold were traded, with over 100,000 pounds being pushed in. Banks such as Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Sumitomo, Huabi, and Shanghai all sold, while HSBC, Taiwan, Huayi, and Mitsui also absorbed approximately 60,000 to 70,000 pounds.

<h3>Overseas Silver Market Telegram Reports Rebound</h3>

The near-term increased by 0625 to 15 pence and 6875 (equivalent to British gold at 1 shilling, 6 pence, and 5625). The distant term also rebounded by 0625, calculated at 15 pence and 625.

Subsequent telegrams showed no changes.</p>
<h3>Lingering Signs of Year-End Settlement Approaching</h3>
<p>The Shanghai silver and money industry traditionally conducts a general year-end settlement, and this year, adhering to the national calendar, they are engaging in settlement earlier at this time. However, due to various reasons, general commercial firms have been unable to achieve this as desired, with some adopting a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, extending loans for this settlement is quite difficult. At the time, there will be no huge uncollectible accounts, but a small number of outstanding debts cannot be avoided. Therefore, everyone is currently shrinking their scope in order to safely pass the year-end, leading to sparse transactions in the market, and the market price is thereby sluggish.</p>
<p>Silver capital is becoming increasingly loose (foreign interest). The morning price was 7 qian, 2 fen, 4 li, and 2 hao and a half, a drop of 7 hao and a half compared to the morning price of the previous day. The afternoon market weakened by another 2 hao and a half to 7 qian, 2 fen, and 4 li, resulting in a total drop of 1 li. The situation is particularly weak, with signs of continued decline (silver dismantling). The morning price was 1 qian, a slight drop of 5 fen compared to the previous morning. The afternoon market only opened at 6 fen, with the spread initially at 2 or 3 fen and soon becoming a white spread. The bank's listed price was 4 fen. The situation of silver capital is currently very loose, and the spread is also very abundant.</p>
<p>Copper coins continue to decline. Jiangnan small foreign coins are recently due to fine and rare routes for transport. The market price is difficult to look forward and uphold the morning afternoon in both markets was six qian six fen two li compared to the previous day market but also dropped one li market transactions only two thousand Guangdong small foreign market have also gradually eased yesterday morning afternoon market also both six qian six fen li also slightly less than half a share of the previous day morning transactions to eight hundred and fifty thousand afternoon market six hundred and fifty thousand The coin also fell by three thousand five hundred at the beginning. There was relatively little movement in and out of silver coins (silver loans). Yesterday, the bank's collections were particularly quiet. Chinese merchants collected a little over 2 million in notes, foreign merchants collected 1.3 to 1.4 million, and various commodity exchange taxes and miscellaneous collections amounted to 789,000 yuan. Settlements amounted to over 100,000, with 300,000 leaving the warehouse and 500,000 entering the warehouse. The Japanese commercial bank collected over 3.3 million in various items, with 890,000 in settlements, 500,000 leaving the warehouse, and a single collection of over 39 million by money houses and silver public offices. Spreads amounted to 340,000, with various remittance collections totaling over 1.3 million, and tens of thousands in cash collections (foreign loans). The morning market saw 1,015,000 in foreign exchange and draft loans, and 945,000 in the afternoon market. The morning market saw 10,000 in banknotes, and 35,000 in the afternoon market. Outside the market, the morning market saw 172,000 in banknotes, and 92,000 in the afternoon market. Banks mutually traded 500,000 in the morning and afternoon markets. Various banks collected and disbursed over 1.7 million in foreign accounts, with over 200,000 in banknote entries and exits. Money houses collected over 4.7 million in foreign public notes, with 150,000 in foreign spreads. Foreign loans for demolition and lending amounted to over 90,000. It was heard yesterday that the Yangtze River gang and the Zhenjiang area had collected 780,000, but there was no expenditure at all, so the foreign interest market price fell.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Remain Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai stock market and various bond markets remained quiet, with few transactions in both the opening and closing markets. The opening market saw approximately 2.3 million in transactions, and the closing market saw approximately 2.6 million yuan. Bond prices remained very sluggish due to the market's inactivity. There was almost no change in the closing market. As a result, with the exception of the whole six for the next month's term, which continued to fall by one yuan compared to the previous day, the post-settlement for the 19th year for this month's term rebounded by six jiao and a half, while others had varying increases and decreases, with the amount only around two jiao. The stagnant situation was even worse than before.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Markets Rebound and Tend Towards Stability</h3>
<p>The yarn market was slightly firm, as continuous declines led to profit-taking and short covering. At the same time, spot yarn sales were more active. However, Japanese merchants and the Chao gang maintained a calm attitude, with no intention of covering positions. In short, there was too much inventory, and with the year-end approaching, there were no major price increases. After a large decline, there should be a rebound.</p>
<p>The spot market saw a rebound after the decline in human contracts. The human market saw a opening market with a faint heart due to the decline in American cotton. With the market still weak, the market fell by five or seven yuan. Merchants taking profits covered their positions, and the market rose again, resulting in an increase of 1.2 yuan and a long-term decrease of 2 yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were more active, with each month increasing by 7, 9, and points of a yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was 21,650 bales. It was found that Minghua sold 1,400 bales, Yiyu sold 1,800 bales, Daji sold 1,000 bales, and the remaining 3, 4, 5, and 600 bales. Tianlong bought 1,400 bales, Hanfeng bought 900 bales, Lichang bought 800 bales, and the remaining 3, 5, and 600 bales. The closing prices are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>The spot prices are more streamlined, and spot yarn sales are more active. It was found that various gangs bought 2,465 bales of spot goods, with 55 bales entering the same industry, 75 bales entering Qingdao, 170 bales entering Siyong, 380 bales entering Tianjin, 170 bales entering Luzhou, and 140 bales entering miscellaneous gangs.</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market is Driven Higher by the Gold Rush</h3>
<p>The cotton market in the morning saw a decline in American cotton, with the latest estimate of the bale amount reduced by 195,000 bales, but the price decline led to a weak market sentiment. The selling pressure was slightly stronger, with each decline of 12 points of a yuan. In the afternoon, it was heard that the gold price had soared, and the Han gang's purchases were tightened, but spot cotton transactions had completely stopped. Therefore, some of the bearish Chao gang had stabilized their minds and had no intention of covering their positions. It was heard that British and Japanese manufacturers had fixed the raw materials of Indian cotton and could supply them until March and April next year. After that, the Chinese cotton consumption was greatly disappointed.</p>
<p>The human market has seen a high rise. The human market saw the decline in American cotton due to a faint heart so it declined of one to two yuan. Retailers covering their positions as a result the short term rose two pennies. After the gold price soared it bought air suddenly to a high degree. The daily transaction total amounts to fifty-three thousand seven hundred and fifty two.</p>

<h3>Declining Grain River Rice Market</h3>
<p>Zhabei Road saw 30 to 40 merchants selling. Due to the clear weather, the northbound market was weak, and high-quality goods were extremely scarce, initially opening at 13.5 yuan, but the overall market dropped by about 20%. The buying interest for Bo Dao rice was weak, and the inventory was still sufficient, so the price softened by 10%. Special high-quality rice opened at 12 yuan. The supply of Guankou Yangxian rice was not high, and the market was stable. The sales of Duxian rice were limited, and the price softened slightly. The sales of Bu Xian rice were still acceptable, and the market was extremely flat. The sales of Bianyuan Yin rice were poor, and there were mostly ordinary varieties arriving, which were not very popular among importers, and the market price fell slightly by 10% to 20%. The market price for high-quality Bianyuan rice was around 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 20 boats arrived in the Henan district of Shanghai. The inbound sales in this area became stagnant. The sales of Changxi and Beigeng rice were not strong, and the price of high-quality rice fell. The market price for ordinary-quality rice was initially high, opening at 13 yuan. The overall prices of mid-quality rice also fell by 20%. The sales of Su Tong Baigeng rice also declined, with a weak and stagnant trend. The initial price of Nanbang Bo Dao rice was still stable, but due to weak buying interest, the price fell slightly by 10%. High-quality Meng Eleven opened at 50% or 60%. The supply of Yang Dujian's high-quality goods was also scarce in this area, and the price was maintained at the original level. Bianyuan rice sales were sluggish, and the market was stagnant. The sales of rice in the hanging workshop were slightly increased, and there were also inquiries from the stores, but the inventory was still high and the arrivals continued, so the market price continued to decline.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Re-enters Good Territory</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market both in the morning and afternoon, the market for all months showed a firm and strong trend again. This was because the quoted price of foreign wheat showed a slight improvement, and the current situation has changed compared to the previous week. The spot prices of "Green Soldiers," "Green Double Horse," and other brands from various factories were all quoted at two taels, two mace, and two and a half candareens, with the "Red and Blue Car" brand also available for purchase, but requiring an additional three candareens based on the standard market value. Moreover, since the exchange rate has contracted again, those peddling foreign wheat have disappeared. Therefore, there seems to be hope for the revival of what seemed like a dead market. The return to favorable conditions for both near-term and long-term contracts is not without reason. As a result, this month's closing price rose by one and a half candareens compared to the previous day, January rose by one candareen and seven li, February rose by one and a half candareens, March rose by two candareens, April rose by one and a half candareens, and May rose by one and a half candareens.</p>
<h3>Wheat Market Ascends to Great Heights Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the futures wheat market in both the morning and afternoon, all months showed an upward trend again. With a slight improvement in the quoted price of foreign wheat, the buying force for this month is currently quite strong. It is said that mainland factories, in view of the high price of local wheat and the relatively cheap standard market value, have been gradually buying in the market in preparation for future deliveries. Therefore, the standard, which was previously ignored by buyers, has regained its favorable position, something that short sellers cannot achieve. The far-term contracts are also eagerly being covered, and the market sentiment is also good. As a result, this month rose by three candareens compared to the previous day, January rose by four candareens, February rose by five candareens, March rose by four candareens, April rose by two candareens, and May rose by one candareen. The spot wheat market is very quiet due to the factories' lack of appetite. Furthermore, recently, major factories have imported foreign wheat, totaling five ships, but it is not yet clear which companies they belong to.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw Sugar Falls Five Candareens</h3>
<p>Japanese Sugar Rises Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market received telegrams from producing regions stating that the spot price of Cuban raw sugar remained at 1.375, and the December price of New York futures sugar was 1.28, a decrease of five candareens compared to the previous telegram. The March price for the next year was 1.40, and the May price was 1.48, each down one candareen. The September price remained at 1.62. There were no changes in the prices of Java spot and futures sugar. In the guild market, the initial market sentiment for raw sugar was quite strong, with prices quoted at eight taels and one mace, but buyers were cautious and did not move forward, so the trend was slightly flat. Subsequently, Maocheng offered 1,000 bags of spot goods at a price of eight taels, and other dealers also offered similar prices. The sellers were still holding on, but the price had fallen by five candareens compared to the previous day. Middle-grade white sugar of the 20th grade was sparsely traded at seven taels and two and a half mace. Eighth-grade Dutch red sugar was traded at six taels, six mace, and seven and a half candareens, and tenth-grade sugar was traded at six taels and eight mace. The market sentiment in Yong City was quite strong, with Japanese sugar rising by five candareens to one mace. YRO mark was seven taels and seven mace, YT mark was eight taels, two mace, and two and a half candareens. High-grade goods with SH mark at eight taels were even more scarce. YP mark was eight taels and seven mace, and Meiji goods were eight taels and seven and a half mace. The market was quite firm. There was a demand for various grades of Tai Koo sugar at the original prices, but the telegram indicated that there were no goods available for this month, and the shipping price for January was an additional five candareens. The dealers' interest was very low, and there were few transactions for the time being. Yuxiang offered more than two hundred bags of first-grade crystal sugar at a price of seven taels and four mace. Guo Huo offered hundreds of boxes of Five Blessings crystal sugar at a price of six taels and seven mace, an increase of one mace compared to the original price. The market sentiment was stable.</p>
<h3>Dried Fruits: New Xiamen Tangerine Cakes Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>The tangerine cakes produced in Xiamen have always been very famous. However, in recent years, due to the competition from local factory products, production has been greatly reduced. This year's production is especially scarce, so they have been out of stock for a long time. Yesterday, it was heard that the Guangli and Taiyuan ships arrived one after another, both carrying some. However, the quantity was only about twenty-odd pieces. Samples can be seen today. If the cakes are soft and the color is moist, they should sell well.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, and Foreign Firms: Silk Sales Remain Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market of foreign firms in this port became even more deserted. There was no movement in overseas silk sales. Chinese silk merchants were eager to sell their stocks due to the need for funds as the end of the year approached, but there were no buyers, and the market sentiment was sluggish. Yesterday, only Samsung showed interest in the top-grade Crane brand seven-li white silk, with five packages priced at six hundred and sixty taels.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Piece Goods Amidst the Soaring Gold Prices</h3>
<p>Prices of Goods Inevitably Rise Slightly</p>
<p>The local fabric market has shown a slight turnaround in recent days. Fine cloth and fine twill, which had been falling frequently, have now risen in unison. There is considerable demand from local customers, and the sale of dyed坯 is particularly active, so the price has already risen by about one mace yesterday. Yang Crane fine cloth opened at six taels, four mace, and two and a half candareens, Rainbow Ball at six taels and four and a half mace, Blue Flying Fish at six taels and nine mace, and Blue Chicken at six taels and four mace. Fine twill is also firm: Yang Crane at six taels, seven mace, and two and a half candareens, and Blue Double Fish at six taels, five mace, and seven and a half candareens. The Flying Bear and Dafugui brands of Changzhou goods are very popular with the Guangbang tailors, and two or three hundred pieces have been shipped out daily. However, coarse twill is still weak: Three Rabbits sells for five taels and one and a half mace, and Three Fish for five taels and two mace. Coarse cloth, after a period of strong sales, has shown a slight stagnation, and the price has not changed much.</p>
<p>Eastern and Western Piece Goods have Slightly Improved Due to the Recent Surge in Gold Prices. Eastern Goods, such as Yuanzhi Genuine呢, and Lotus, have been Rising Rapidly Every Day. Si Ye Coarse Goods Opened at Three Mace and Six and a Half Candareens, Three Pools at Three Mace and Five and a Half Candareens, Mogan Mountain is Out of Stock, Hunting Goose at Three Mace, Three Candareens and Seven Li. Straight Satin Spot Goods are Out of Stock: First Merit, Four Scholars, Flying Horse Boy, Magpie Bridge Meeting, and Seven Treasure Beads are Not Available on the Market. Only Three Friends Picture is Available at Two Mace, Nine Candareens and Seven Li. Fine Serge is Difficult to Rise Due to the Abundance of Inventory, but the Three Friends Picture and Lake Pavilion in Green T扎and Green are Quite Popular. Colored Velvet is Being Searched for by Japanese Streets: Bald Concubine is Seven Taels and One Mace, Hanshan Temple and Yang Guifei Assorted Colors are Six Taels and Seven Mace. White Western Yarn of Western Goods Arrives Daily but has Not Yet Been Sold.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Association Iron Fixed Price Rises</h3>
<p>Due to the Small Arrival of 200-pound Association Iron and the Strong Demand, the Standard Flying Yellow Tengda Brand can be Estimated at 24 Taels and Two Mace per Box, which is More than 1 Tael Higher than Before. However, the Frequent Contraction of Foreign Exchange Rates has had Some Impact on People's Confidence. However, According to Foreign Firm News, the Fixed Price of this Product is Currently Estimated at 7 Gold Yuan, 1 Mace, and 5 Candareens per Box, which is 2 Mace and 5 Candareens Higher than Before. Therefore, it is Expected that the Shanghai Market Price May Not Fall Back for the Time Being.</p>

<h3>A Unique Automobile Driver Oath</h3>
<p>— Zhizheng</p>
<p>Cleveland Safety Design Committee Creates Ten Commandments for Drivers to Swear to, an Ingenious Way to Reduce Car Accidents</p>
<p>Among the many automobile problems at present, none is more serious than car accidents. Engineering experts in various countries are studying from a mechanical perspective how to reduce dangers. Municipal experts are trying to limit speeding from a municipal perspective. These and other articles published in newspapers are truly countless and magnificent. As the previous issue of this publication contained, "On the Global Road Association Solving the Problem of Car Accidents," it can be said that no effort was spared and everything was taken into consideration. However, in fact, although the laws are strict, the problem of accidents is increasing daily. In Shanghai alone, there were more than 10,000 cases in eleven months, which is extremely shocking. Car accidents are so serious, and the methods everyone comes up with are even more ingenious. Recently, in order to solve the problem of car accidents, the Cleveland City Government in the United States specially organized a Safety Design Committee. What is the committee's plan? It's actually quite interesting: it has formulated ten articles of faith, requiring each car driver to sign, obey, and swear to abide by them. These ten articles of faith are important conditions for preventing car accidents. After each car driver swears, it is stored in the committee for safekeeping. It is said that in this way, car accidents have indeed been reduced greatly. These ten sworn articles of faith are listed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) When I am driving, I will only act as half of the people in the world, who are deaf and blind, and their safety must be maintained by me. What is the idea of this article of faith? It is to correct the current car drivers' impatience. When driving, they stare at everything and drive at full speed, or they clearly see that there are many people in front of them, but they always think that they must give way, so they are not willing to reduce their speed and proceed calmly. Now, they are told to think that half of the people in the world are deaf and blind, and drivers will naturally be extra careful.</p>
<p>(2) When I am driving, I must pay special attention and stop immediately in case of danger. This article seems very simple, but it also has deep meaning. Because most drivers now cannot concentrate on being careful, they secretly drive their vehicles. When danger occurs, it is naturally too late to brake, and accidents therefore occur and cannot be remedied. If every driver can concentrate on driving and stop immediately in case of danger, the problem of accidents can be solved.</p>
<p>(3) I swear to respect the rights of other drivers and pedestrians and obey the road laws. The biggest drawback of drivers is that they are arrogant and think that only they are the most honorable. Therefore, they do not care about pedestrians and have no courtesy towards other drivers. Accidents therefore arise. Therefore, the United States is now promoting "Road Courtesy," which is exactly this meaning. If everyone is courteous, all problems can be solved.</p>
<p>(4) At intersections, schools, and other areas that require special attention, I must reduce my speed so that I can stop at any time. Intersections are the most accident-prone places, especially in prosperous areas, where car collisions occur frequently. The reason is nothing more than the unwillingness to reduce speed and driving recklessly. As a result, when an accident occurs, it is too late to avoid it, so extra care is needed in these places.</p>
<p>(5) I swear not to regard cars as toys. The main cause of car accidents is that drivers are unwilling to be cautious. They mostly regard cars as toys, circling around and climbing mountains, thinking that it is a kind of game. How can they not have accidents? Therefore, to remedy this, drivers must swear that they will no longer take cars as toys.</p>
<p>(6) When I am parking or turning, I must first turn on the lights. Car signals are originally very simple. They only have the red light on the back, which is the most important. However, many drivers inadvertently ignore even just one red light. Parking and turning are the most important. If the red light is not turned on, the vehicles behind cannot be notified, and collisions are inevitable.</p>
<p>(7) I must drive on the right side of the road and obey the police's instructions. In Europe and the United States, driving is on the right side of the road. In China, it is on the left side of the road. The right side and the left side are not the problem. Only obedience is the most important. In big cities, the right-hand rule can still work. Once in the countryside, cars act completely freely and no longer care about what is left and right. Therefore, the most serious accidents do not occur in major cities but on remote highways. The reason is the same: obeying the police's instructions is even more important; otherwise, it will completely fall into disorder.</p>
<p>(8) When the weather is bad, I must drive with special caution. Not to mention anything else, just foggy weather is enough. Everything becomes blurred. When two cars drive towards each other, a collision will occur immediately with one careless move. The same is true for snowy weather.</p>
<p>(9) I swear to abide by the traffic laws. Although traffic laws cannot be said to completely eliminate accidents, if they are conscientiously obeyed, they can ultimately achieve considerable effectiveness. We examine the causes of car accidents. Violating traffic laws is also an important component. Therefore, if cars can strictly abide by traffic laws, it can be said to be a good medicine that treats the symptoms.</p>
<p>(10) When reversing, I must first see clearly behind me. Accidents caused by reversing are also not uncommon. Most of them occur because they did not see clearly whether there were pedestrians and vehicles behind them before reversing. As a result, people only pay attention to the vehicles coming from the front but do not suspect that the vehicle behind them is reversing. Therefore, this matter seems very small, but the impact is quite large.</p>
<p>From the above, the ten articles of faith formulated by the Cleveland Safety Design Committee, although unusually simple, used to be seen by car drivers as uninteresting in the past. Now, car drivers swear to abide by them, changing from passive to active, and its effect is naturally different from those who are regarded as irrelevant.</p>
<h3>Ratio of Cars to People in the World</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>There are 35 million cars in the world, with one car for every 55 people.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the United States Department of Commerce, in 1929, the number of cars in the world exceeded 35,000,000. The survey included 157 countries, territories, and regions. The total number of registered passenger cars, freight cars, and buses in the world was 35,127,389, an increase of 3,092,826 or 9 percent compared to the beginning of 1929. The number of cars on the roads in various countries around the world is increasing daily. In 1922, the total was 12,530,416, which increased to 155 percent by 1929.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 1930, with a world population of 1,949,000,000, there was one car for every 55 people. In 1929, the number was one car for every 61 people. In the United States, according to the latest statistics, there is one car for every 4.5 people. A year ago, there was one car for every 4.87 people. Outside the United States, there is one car for every 216 people. At the beginning of 1929, there was one car for every 247 people.</p>
<p>Canada and New Zealand's car-to-population ratio is slightly lower than that of the United States, ranking second, with one car for every eight people. Australia ranks third, with one car for every ten people. Monaco is fourth, with one car for every sixteen people. In Yemen, in southwestern Arabia, there is only one car for every 104,166 people. In Ethiopia, there is one car for every 17,781 people. In Afghanistan, there is one car for every 17,778 people. The above-mentioned latest statistics show increases in East, West, South Africa, China, Persia, Syria, and Siam. Other smaller countries have seen slightly more car sales opportunities recently.</p>
<p>According to the latest car statistics, the number of registered cars of various styles in the continental United States reached 26,653,450, which is three times more than in foreign countries. In the United States alone, the number of registered passenger cars accounted for 78 percent of the world's total, and commercial vehicles accounted for 62 percent of the total. France ranks second in the total number, followed by England and Canada. Among the countries with cars in the world, Oman, a southwestern Arab territory, and Bermuda, a British territory, have only ten registered cars, ranking last.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The number of commercial vehicles registered worldwide is greater than that of passenger cars. In 1929, the number of passenger cars registered worldwide increased by 2,540,511 or 9.4 percent, while the number of freight cars and buses increased by 552,315 or 10.9 percent. Therefore, the number of passenger cars increased by 7.3 percent compared to the increase in 1928, while freight cars and buses decreased by 0.1 percent.</p>
<p>The number of passenger cars in most countries is greater than that of freight cars. However, in some countries, the number of commercial vehicles exceeds that of passenger cars, and these commercial vehicles can open up remote areas, leading the way for the use of passenger cars. In 1929, the number of car registrations in the United States increased by 2,026,527 or 8.2 percent, compared to an increase of 1,367,738 or 5.9 percent in the previous year. Outside the United States, the increase in cars in 1929 was 1,069,297 or 14.40 percent, compared to 973,347 or 15.1 percent in 1928.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>The Honor of the Morris Cowley</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>It is difficult to travel the 8,000 miles from Cape Town to Cairo, the capital of Egypt, due to road repairs and obstacles. Now, a 1924 Morris Cowley convertible has uniquely completed this long-distance journey and is the first standard British vehicle to create this record. It is commendable and worthy of praise that the drivers, Miss Bairche and Miss White Gil, are the first successful women to achieve this.</p>
<p>Miss Bairche and Miss White set off from Cape Town on April 1, taking the route through Johannesburg, Nairobi, Juba, and Aswan towards Cairo. On the way, the Rhodesian mountains were flooded, and the car could not move forward, delaying them for seven weeks. When they arrived at Carl Ferry, they were delayed again for more than ten days. They finally arrived safely in Cairo on September 15, taking a total of five and a half months. They then went from Alexandria to Marseille, through Calais, to England on September 29. Sir William hosted a banquet at the Morris factory to welcome them wholeheartedly. Sir William was the first to sign the ladies' diaries when they set off from Cape Town. He was also one of the last to sign, as he signed the book again upon completion of the journey to congratulate them on their success. It is said that this car never needed to be repaired throughout the journey, and the reputation of the Morris car was greatly enhanced. In October, the number of daily visitors to the Morris car's London sales office was overwhelming, like the scenery on the Shanyin Road.</p>

<h3>Market News</h3>

<p>Gong Lechun Sichuan Restaurant across from the Sanma Grand Stage declares that the restaurant's prosperity is the best among Shanghai's restaurants because its dishes are inexpensive and delicious, and cooked by famous chefs. Now, to treat customers, a special discount coupon is being issued. Holders of this coupon will receive an additional 10% discount. The restaurant has been crowded every day, and customers have praised it, they say.</p>
<p>Dacheng Fengji Ginseng and Bird's Nest Shop at the intersection of Xian Gua Street and Dongmen Road declares that the shop has been selling tonics such as ginseng and bird's nest for many years.

<p>Weiyi Company at 366 Bai'er Road declares that the Guowei spicy soy sauce produced by the company is made with extremely exquisite raw materials and methods, and contains monosodium glutamate and vitamin nutrients. The taste is both good and completely vegetarian, surpassing imported products. Therefore, it has been very popular in society since its release. Various Chinese and Western restaurants in the city and Nanyang and other places have purchased it in large quantities. For a time, sales were brisk and supply could not meet demand. The company has recently stepped up its supervision of manufacturing and strived for perfection. To promote national goods, each bottle is sold for only 20 cents, a cheap and good value. It is truly a star of national seasoning products, they say.</p>
<p>Zhonghua Industrial Chemical Research Institute at 366 Bai'er Road declares that the "Tuise Ling" developed by the institute has set a new record for national bleaching solution. The quality of the bleaching solution is extremely excellent.

<h3>Market News</h3>

This is an unprecedented initiative. Therefore, business is booming, they say.</p>
<p>Yanhua Restaurant, located west of the Shenshi Xianjie on Sima Road, declares that business at the restaurant has been even more crowded recently. From 6:00 PM every day, diners are fully seated and it is very lively. The hot pot dishes are the most popular. More than one hundred yuan worth of takeaways are delivered every day, indicating that the restaurant's hot pot dishes are trusted by people in society. With the increase in business, several top-class chefs have been hired to specialize in hot pot dishes, striving for perfection, so diners are all satisfied, they say.</p>
<p>Tongbaokang Chinese Pharmacy on Yangshupu Yangzhou Road declares that the shop has been established since 1927, and for four years has been praised by the local people for its careful selection of authentic top-quality herbs for decoctions, and the precise blending of pills and powders.

The shop is building a two-story shikumen-style building with stone walls and a larger overall scale at the intersection of Pingliang Road and Taopeng Road, across from the small vegetable market, and is equipped with the most complete facilities. It will be the largest Chinese pharmacy in the Pudong area. The building will be completed within days, and the opening date is expected to be in the Chinese New Year, they say.</p>

<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>Shanghai Film Company declares that at a time when the national chaos has subsided, the North and South are unified, and Europe and the United States have signed non-war agreements, the company is producing a wartime epic that does not forget danger in peace, named "Enemy Blood, Passion Flower." The film is a masterpiece by Lu Hanping of the Third Group and will soon meet with the people of Shanghai. There will also be a natural drama performance by the company, they say.</p>
<p>Mingxing Film Company declares that it has recently assembled all the talents of the company and divided them into groups to produce new films. Zhang Shichuan is not only devoting his energy to the full dialogue and singing of the national sound epic film "Singer Red Tandan", but also producing the sixteen-episode "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple", which is expected to be completed within the year. The martial arts epic "Robber Filial Son", which began filming a month ago, is also more than halfway completed and can be released in the New Year. The film "Brave Rescuers" directed by Tang Jie and Wang Jiting will also be completed. The comedy "Three Fathers", co-directed by Tan Zhiyuan and Gao Lihen, has now started filming. Cheng Bugao is preparing to produce "Flower of the Silver Screen", starring Wang Yuanlong and Xuan Jinglin, and Xu Xinfu is also preparing the martial arts film "Love of Three Arrows", they say.</p>
<h2>Page 30</h2>
<p>Dazhonghua Film declares that the company's modern martial arts adventure love epic film "King of Magic," which will be completed soon, began filming the "Shoutang" scene yesterday, which was quite exciting and glamorous, especially the scene where the magician Shi Buping (played by Chen Junqiufeng) and Mrs. Yang (played by Ms. Lin Ruxin) fell in love at first sight. When Mrs. Yang first saw Shi Sheng, she saw Shi Sheng as elegant as a prince and as unrestrained as Junrui, and she couldn't help but feel a longing in her heart, and a love thread reached out between her eyebrows. However, Shi Sheng felt that Mrs. Yang also had a myriad of charms, so they were affectionate and whispered sweet words, as sticky as glue. The two really had the regret of not meeting when they were not married. To sum up the above delicate performances, other actors were not capable of them, but Lin and Chen's performances were all able to be considerate and subtle, just fitting the identity of the characters in the play, worthy of the title of experienced, well-experienced, and truly skilled stars, they say.</p>
<p>Jiuxing Grand Theater declares that the Paramount film "Monkey Business," starring the Marx Brothers, was screened at the theater yesterday and the day before. All three showings have been sold out for days. Although it rained yesterday, those who braved the rain to watch were still full. This is because the theater's pronunciation is clear and accurate, and the lighting is sufficient, which is superior to major theaters, and the low price has set a new record for sound films, so it is welcomed by the audience. Unfortunately, there are not many seats in the theater, and the iron gates have been closed before the screening, causing those who came later to feel regret. To avoid crowding, the theater has advanced the ticket sales time and is accepting reservations for the "Monkey Business" film the day before. There are still two days left, and "The Singing Fool," starring Al Jolson, is scheduled to be released in the next period, they say.</p>
<p>Baixing Grand Theater at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Fusheng Road declares that it will release the unprecedented full-color chivalrous film "The Female Pirate" today, which is the only masterpiece of the sensual female star Pauline Starke. It describes the rampage of pirates and the true feelings of love, which other films do not have. The supporting roles in the film are all the leading roles in "Black Pirate Charles," "Bandit Suppressor," and "Flower of the Battlefield," they say.</p>
<p>Yile Bookstore declares that it has specially hired Xia Hesheng, a famous performer from Guangyu Society, to perform and sing "Miao Jin Feng," and Yao Yinmei to perform and sing "Ba Sou Zou Yinglong" starting today. The first half of "Miao Jin Feng" was narrated by Xia Hesheng in the first half of the year. Due to the request of most old listeners, they have tried to retain Xia Hesheng from all sides, and finally obtained Xia Hesheng's approval to continue narrating, so that old listeners have the opportunity to continue listening to the end of the book. However, no one in Shanghai's new storytelling scene can tell the book "Ba Sou Zou Yinglong", which can be said to be Yao Jun's unique talent. The plot is also bizarre and strange, with many highlights. The original "Yue Chuan" by Li Hanchen and "Seven Heroes and Five Righteousnesses" by Han Shiliang are also at a critical juncture, they say.</p>
<h3>Calligraphy and Painting News</h3>
<p>Painter Yi Lu Chen Yichan declares that his name is Zepei, his style name is Rongsheng, he is a lover of epigraphy, and also a painter and zen practitioner. He is from eastern Sichuan. In his youth, he abandoned his pen to study, rich in strategy. He has experienced hardships during the revolutionary service for twenty years. Many generals in Sichuan and Yunnan came from his school. He has the style of a Confucian general. In the middle, he has traveled to famous mountains and rivers at home and abroad, paying attention everywhere. He has specialized in studying the six methods for ten years. His pen is a teacher of nature, and the strange energy in his chest is expressed in calligraphy and painting. Those who get it treasure it. In recent years, he has returned to studying Buddhist teachings and paintings to participate in Zen. He has cultivated his mind in the quiet Kuanglu for two winters and summers, sketching the scenery and creating a grand view. The help of Jiangshan has its own origin. Female Guan Hua is also skilled in landscape painting. The family's calligraphy and painting have recently moved to Shanghai. Her works of Lushan scenery have collected dozens of pieces and will be screened soon. The painter uses the brush of seal script to write the spirit of nature, which is enough to open a new era for Chinese painting. Yu Youren, Wang Yiting, Jiang Boqi, Huang Shihong, Li Liejun, Fang Shengtao, Jia Yao, Zhang Shanzi, Zhang Daqian, Wang Dungen and other gentlemen have made reservations and introduced the remuneration to the world, they say.</p>
