<h3 id="c7">法國北境之罷工潮 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>歐戰一役。各國在經濟上皆受極大打擊。而法國爲戰爭所在地。其産業尤爲不振。各國於戰後因盡力發展工業。故能迅速恢復原狀。而法之所盡力者則不專在工業。故獲效亦較他國爲緩。然至今日。盡力發展之各國。皆受工業激進之害。而法所受影響獨微。此次法國北境之罷工潮。形勢雖甚險惡。然其起原。僅由於雇主與工人意見之不洽。激烈派從而煽動之耳。苟善於調處。自易平息。非若他國工廠之根本上難以維持爲可危也。泰狄歐總理演說。謂法國在世界工商衰落之際。所處經濟地位。比較有利。人民可大受其閱。祇須勞資能雙方合作。公家能撙節開支。輕歛薄賦即可自固。誠非虚語矣。</p>
<p>雖然。此僅就工業國比較而覺其罷工潮之較易處理耳至以實際狀况論。生活程度。同様增高。貿易停頓之潮流。同様感受。法國雖曰重農。然已漸趨向於工業。近其發展。亦有相當成績。惟未若美日等國之猛進。故其所受影響。未至如他國之巨。社會上失業現象。亦未如他國之甚耳。但考其公私財政之困難。情形亦與他國略同。故此後必如泰狄歐之言。能謹愼將事。勿使内部再有枝節發生。方能渡此難關。譬如人之身體。雖有强弱之分。而其病症則同。固無他法可以醫治者也。</p>

<p>兩隊員稍事休息後更易位置然後繼續比賽中華隊先發球挑戰而星聯隊前鋒禦敵後舉行進攻不料射球被阻中鋒再用前法攻擊但亦被阻此後兩隊之前鋒遂作盤旋塲中逐擊斯時該隊之右鋒乘機破敵傳球前鋒而李惠堂雖有良好之機會射球但總不能撥球入圈不過在塲之觀衆大爲星聯隊飽吃一驚發角逐後李惠堂君頗有出力但對方軍勢全强不能容易過關而星聯隊反攻後文勳君衝前射球一分是時觀衆均鼓掌歡呼星聯隊勝利至五時五十五分許星隊再得一球隨後兩隊無甚進展故未有再增加分數至六時許一塲大戰宣告終結星聯隊遂以三比零獲全勝云</p>

<p>吾國創新敎育。垂卅二年。各種展覽會。聞之諗。然未聞有校具之展覽良以校具範圍過廣。舉凡孩提之衣食住行。學校之生活環境。無往而非校具。羅致旣難。展覽更難。今滬市敎局。不憚煩厭。際此蒸熱盛暑之時。空前之校具展覽會已在西成梅溪兩校開幕。是安可不記。爰將槪况錄下。</p>
<p>▲幾疑置身於虹廟弄敎局自春二月十九日開第一次校具展覽籌備會後。迄今且百廿餘日。現分五部陳列。到會出品者及其數量。計有普通用具廿八校二百十八件。敎室用具卅校一百八十七件。各科敎具四十三校一千零五件。娱樂用具廿四校二百七十九件。參攷物品九校七十六件。各部胥有獨出心裁之作品。惟普通用具最易引人入勝。睡床便桶。檯桌椅凳。色色俱全。宛若出賣全套嫁妝。觀者者幾疑身入嫁妝店世界之虹廟弄矣。</p>
<p>▲炳松感恩小姐太太該會開幕禮請商務總編輯兼大夏敎授何炳松講演。何爲史學家。所談不脫老本行。何謂吾國校具。歷史上素不重視。即以敎師坐冷板凳一語。已可想見。敎師用具如此窳敗。學童更無論矣。新敎育初行時。徒設黑板而乏粉筆。斯時惟有乞借小姐太太塗面之鉛粉書寫。師生雖覺不便。然已感恩於小姐太太無狀。蓋若小姐太太不用鉛粉。若此簡陋敎具。尙難出現也。</p>
<p>▲衆老師權作小學生會開第一日。敎局暑校三百五十六位小學敎師。全體由小東門前往參觀。到會時須一律簽名。以别勤惰。衆閱覽一遍。不覺「炎赫衣流汗低埀氣不蘇」乃羣聚西成禮堂休息。堂備長凳低且小。原爲小學生而設。至此衆老師權作小學生。排排坐其上。揮汗拂扇。笑語盈室。中有二三胖體者。蹲踞屋中心狀若彌陀。意甚自得來賓見之。解頣</p>

<p>杭垣前日（二十六）上午十一時四十分鐘。由東面飛來形似黑色之大隊蜻蜓。飛繞空中。觀者於街頭巷尾。紛立翹首而望。據年老者談論。謂蜻蜓多。係年歲大豐之預兆。蓋蜻蜓不傷人間一物。善捕食空中飛行之蝗蟲。故害稻之蟲亦可減少。查今歲浙之米産。確係大佳。廣大之諸曁田畝。較往年收成高數倍。聞新米出盤。已定價每石爲十一元。吾浙民衆。將有賤米可食矣。</p>

<p>日前晉都省親。京滬車中。頗饒聞見。長日無俚。濡筆誌之。▲老父尋子一老叟相貌清癯。負隅不語。頻作嘆息聲。觀其態。似有重大心事者。衆咸異之。抵蘇州。同座某君前叩之。曰余餘姚人也。入都尋子。三年前。余子從戎。隸胡大人麾下。近聞胡大人失利。受傷官兵均運回。佘故晋都而尋之。某君曰。受傷者多。尋可得耶。老叟曰。余甚念之。不知其得不得也。余六十。惟此一子。言時老涙縱横。不勝凄楚。傍坐者無不爲之掩涕云。</p>
<p>▲這是甚麽有着中山裝者二人。談吐甚豪。傍若無人。一見而知爲宦海中人。查票員至。衆以車票騐。二人獨不予。查票員以補票請。厲聲曰。「這是甚麽」。手將徽章出。查票員謝之。</p>
<p>▲香汗涔涔離余座一丈許。有弱女四。髮作波紋。臉泛桃色。旗衫蠻鞾。備極時髦。方車抵無錫。凉風不至。熱氣蒸騰。探首窗外。猶感悶塞。四女不敢稍動。汗如雨下。有某校學生笑曰。今日看見廬山眞面目矣。四女以白眼饗之。</p>
<p>▲大觸霉頭余喜食餅乾。雖至熱亦能進。是日所携者。提籃外。餅乾而已。方佘進餅乾時。一孩在旁饒涎欲滴。繼而哭。向其母索。余以一握予之。其母大怒。奪而棄之地。余莫明其妙。旁坐者亦爲訝異。夫小孩見物。孰不欲食。奪棄於地。是何用意。以其少耶。免嫌疑耶。不可解也</p>

<p>（十）（三）田徑賽塲佈置</p>
<p>年來我國對於各項運動。以田徑賽成績最爲减色。自第五届遠東運動會以後。我國每况愈下。得分之機會亦愈少。第八屆在滬舉行時竟得零分。本届雖僥倖獲得一分。但事實上確係日本南部忠平未參加三練跳遠之故。查南部成績在織田之上。苟入比賽者。則司徒光君將退居第五位。故究非眞實本領取得。日本體恊會某君嘗語記者。田徑賽成績中國可謂進步極少。菲進二步。日本進四步。將來無論如何。中菲均非日本敵手云。查我國田徑賽之不振。觀衆之無興味。亦爲重大原因之一。各地運動會中。球類賽場每較田徑賽塲爲擁擠。即其明證。故如何引。起觀衆興味問題。確應特别研究。從事補救。本篇所載。大可爲國人取法。而體育恊進會中人尤應三注意也。記者五月十七十七兩日在東京參觀日本全國田徑賽選手預選大會。其田徑賽場之佈置。與遠東運動會曾無少異。各項比賽結果。務使觀衆十分明瞭。遠東大會中報告員職務最爲重要。時時報告比賽結果。新聞記者無奔走採訪之苦。而會塲秩序因之非常整肅。例如百米第一組預賽。事前報告員即就無線電報告與賽人名。跑位。跑畢後未數分鐘。即報告結果。及第一名與第二名相距若干。報告員兩旁即爲記者席。所聞更爲清晣。遂互以案頭電語向報館報告此項消息。無電話者用小紙片略書結果。以傳信鴿傳遞。會塲中印有秩序册。觀衆均手持一本。靜聆報告員之語。就本中一一紀錄。目觀手揮。爲狀至樂。滿塲數萬人。實際上均執行記者之職務。故興趣覺倍濃郁田賽之設備。更爲週到。如跳高跳遠等。事前由報告員報告與賽人名。其後每跳一次。均有成績報告。至初賽選中之六人時。復報告姓名一次。比賽終了後。第一名至第四名之成績。重行詳細報告。塲中備有高約數尺之木牌數塊。牌爲黑色。書有白色大阿拉伯字。例如跳高跳至高度一米九五時。木牌即拚出I95三字。遠望異常清晰。至鐵餅鐵球等項。至某種遠度時畫一白粉線。如鐵餅三十米三十五米四十米四十五米五十米等均有白線。並備有小國旗數面。中國選手擲至何處。即以中國旗插於該處。迎風招展。其所擲之遠度。與夫他國比較之遠近。一目了然。日本全國預選會時。無國别之分。此項小旗棄而未用。僅以紅色小旗一面插在世界紀錄處。以示競爭惕勉之意。故田賽場秩序井然。除評判員選手外無一人入場。即攝影記者亦限制極嚴。日本報紙對運動消息。紀載最爲迅速。凡下午三時半以前之比賽結果。當日晚報均可刋載。下午七時以前消息。八時通信社即有詳細稿件。此亦應歸功於田徑賽塲完善之佈置也。我國田徑賽塲秩序最爲混亂。歷次運動會均然。而前次杭州全國運動會爲尤甚。主辦人員濫發評判員徽章。混入田賽塲内參觀。新聞記者因大會無正式關於比賽結果之報告。故不得不奔波塲内。四往採訪。而報告員杜庭修旣不執行報告之職務。又在無線電中再三聲言驅逐記者出塲。公然侮辱記者。逾越報告員職權之外。記者固不應入塲採訪。但大會應時時令報告員報告結果。簡接維持全塲秩序。故其責任完全在大會主事人員之不當。而杜庭修之缺乏常識。尤爲可笑也。</p>

<p>第十三回是誰種福無意得鑽環惟此因緣有心歌金縷</p>
<p>原來這萬國園游會延長的那一天。就是種福券當衆開奬的那一天。。有許多人買了幾張券。好似把錢已經捐助給人家了。。中奬不中奬。。他已不復注意。。也有許多太太們。。小姐們。。他們買了一張券。。很有極大的希望。。這好似跑馬汛中所買的香賓票。。在没有開彩的當兒。。好似頭彩都在自己腰包裏一般。。而且頭二三彩。。又都是貴重珍品。。因此渴望得奬者很多。。再加着辦萬國園游會的幾位幹事們。。因爲這個會成績良好。。他們也興高彩烈。。在最後一天。。又加進了許多餘興。。除了中西燄火之外。。還有什麽西洋音樂。。以及中國的崑曲清唱之類。。因此車水馬龍。。比較前三天更爲熱鬧。。那天時觀平尤爲興致勃勃。。在下午三點鐘的時候。。他跑到平報館的主筆房裏來。。說你們到張園去吧。。今天是最後一天。。加多了許多游戲節目。。而且又是種福券今天在那裏開奬。。你們倘然去的。。我有馬車在這裏。。大家說。。去過一回就好了。。第二回就覺得没有什麽意思。。祇不過是這點頑意兒。。而且到一處地方。。總得花幾個錢。。會塲中的吃喝。。也比外面貴得多。。說不定還遇到了熟識的太太小姐們。。被伊們敲了竹槓去。。時觀平道。。我倒要去看看。。他們派了我二百張券。。我起初以爲消不掉的了。。後來你分五張。。我分十張。。居然被我銷去了不少。。現在自己不到二十張了。。我想這二百張劵内。。總有幾個彩。。開在裏面。。大彩没有。。小彩總也有幾個。。開過彩後。。那個種福劵的機關。。也就結束了。。我經手得奬幾張劵。。分派與他們後。。也就没有我的事了。。這時左詩晨剛纔到館。。時觀平向着他道。。怎麽様。。今天張園的種福劵。。當衆開奬了。。你不是也有十張票子嗎。。何妨一同去看看。。說不定頭彩就在你手裏咧。。左詩晨道。。好好。。倘然我的劵中了頭奬。。請你打一個電話通知我就是了。。我就來領奬。。或是請你把所領之奬。。帶給我便了。。這不過兩人的一句戲言。。以爲要在這許多的劵中。。獲得大彩。。宛同大海撈針。。誰知不到四點半鐘的時候。。果然時觀平從味蒓園來一個電話。。向茶房說。。請左先生來聽電話。。左詩晨跑去聽時。。時觀平道。。你的種福劵。。在你身邊嗎。。左詩晨把自己身上的許多口袋一搜索。。却是没有。。</p>

<p>收回電話權交涉</p>
<p>中美航空權問題</p>
<p>平津間郵務工潮</p>
<p>中日電信交涉正在進行昨日外王已與重光作初步之接治將來由交部負責與日方接洽交涉收回查中日電信水綫有三一由上海至長崎二由青島至佐世保三爲東北南滿鐵路之電信權均在二月份次第期滿本報記者昨晤交長王伯羣氏時曾詢及此事及其他問題兹將王氏所談分述如次</p>
<p>▲收回電信權王氏謂關於收回電信權交涉如大東大北及中日水綫等均在範圍以内按日本對於電信權絶對屬於國有不許其他任何機關獲有營業權但法國則反是可以自由經營交部方針擬用日本政策最低限度對於其營業權亦須加以相當限制庶政府可以操持監督</p>
<p>▲三月後進行現時因眞茹大電臺尙未建築工竣加以金潮高漲遽言收回我國吃虧過大太不合算且市上公債種類已多再有發行定感困難故交部現時對日丹各方頗願加以研究討論詳爲接洽至備價收回俟二月後大電臺告成再開始積極進行屆時金價亦可望稍跌</p>
<p>▲新公司成立王氏又謂關於中美航空問題現合同已簽字資本我百分五十五美飛運公司百分四十五董事我三美二各種用人行政均按資本分配曾開過董事會二次新公司已完全成立但仍沿用中國航空公司名義</p>
<p>▲我國資本金我國資本金由滬蓉航空處及前中國航空公司資産撥入計共作價爲四百萬元尙短少百五十萬元美方資本已足我國所短少之資金仍由交行擔保美方亦已承認至前滬蓉之技術人員已盡量介紹至新公司服務</p>
<p>▲平津郵工潮記者詢以處理平津郵務工潮辦法王氏謂當由北平郵務局負責辦理交部以不累及民衆爲主旨近日北來郵件多不貼郵票照章應由受主倍罰但爲體恤計曾令郵局不必施罚僅補足原價爲止云云又王氏近稍感不適暫時養疴滬上並不返京</p>

<p>孫老五死狀極可慘</p>
<p>在逃姪有弑叔嫌疑</p>
<p>接近江灣之侯家宅昨晨發生命案一起死者孫鈞寳通州人年五十歳死狀甚慘係被人用鋤式利刃剪刀强行斫剌而死兇手於事後遠逸祇獲嫌疑帮兇一名據死者之姪所控則其叔之死其堂弟有重大嫌疑果爾亦一逆倫鉅案也</p>
<p>▲草屋之中血腥觸鼻死者孫鈞寳行五人都以老五呼之住於侯家宅後浜草屋一椽一人居之因年力就衰無工可作於屋後種植菜蔬藉以爲生昨晨五時許有蔣木匠者前去敲門久之無應者乃至推門而入突有血腥氣一股直種鼻官不覺大異及至定神一看則見孫老五已僵臥地上血肉狼藉駭極返奔立即報告崗警該管五區公安局屈家橋派出所巡長前往草屋勘察見死者四週血流如渠盡作殷紅之色頭部已被斫去一小半面頰削平牙齒纍粒可見左肋胸部及背背脊均有巨大創洞左手之指被刀斫去身體腃側地上作臨死爭扎之狀慘不忍覩其兇器似爲鋤剪之屬</p>
<p>▲膝下無兒領姪作子孫老五被殺之由頗爲曲折據其姪孫福生所言則其堂弟孫連生有弑叔之重大嫌疑死者行年半百於十年前喪偶膝下猶虚三年前向其三兄孫學文過繼第四子孫佐利作爲嗣子佐利年幼不慣與孫老五同居未幾即返通州而斷去寄父寄子之情孫老五乃又向其弟學文過繼佐利之兄連生爲子連生現年二十六歲已娶妻生子過繼於孫老五時其妻亦與焉</p>
<p>▲嗣子無行遣送回籍孫連生素無行年前絜妻來滬與孫老五同居於侯家宅因無業可謀孫乃購黄包車一輛而令之拉車生利孫連生性懶好賭所得之錢輒如數化去且與惡友相交置妻子於不問孫老五更不能得其贍心中殊覺氣憤一月前乃决計遣孫連生夫婦返籍斷絶嗣子關係孰知孫連生返通未久又潛來滬上其時約在半月之前</p>
<p>▲偷錢賣車老人氣憤孫連生返滬後又往依其叔孫老五初不假以詞色因被擾不清始容居之孰知本性難改馴至與匪人爲友將孫老五之私蓄竊去不饜所慾又將黄包車偷出私售於人事洩由孫老五出錢贖回對連生大不謂然申斥有加而連生之匪友六七人對孫老五乃不懷好意有恫嚇之言詞</p>
<p>▲向姪訴苦隔日即斃孫老五之長姪孫福生在南市十六舖外馬路老太平弄口一百卅六號匯豐汽車充當車夫兩日前孫老五前去探視見面後謂孫曰連生日趨下流其友六七人對吾均不懷好意恐有性命之憂奈何孫福生即向伊叔好言慰藉不謂事隔一日孫老五竟遭謀殺愈信其姪　孫連生或即此案首兇謀財起意也</p>
<p>▲求助隣人拘獲帮兇據死者之隣人言孫於未死前數日神情頗爲惶張常向隣人求助謂「余年老恐遭不測乞旦夕臨視感且不朽」隣人異其言多私議其變更態度者事出後孫連生即不知去向由警將嫌疑帮兇之拉車人季雙全拘獲候訊</p>

<p>第二章「民間文學與文學」是將民問文學與普通所指的文學的價值與及它們的闢係和區别都有系統的叙述使我們對於民間文學更有進一層的認識以作者的觀察所得民間文學與與普通所指的文學的價值實無軒輊之分即是說它倆是一而二二而一的同時它倆發生了密切的關係因爲文學有許多地方正是靠着民間文學的這實是民間文學應有高貴的地位了</p>
<p>文學是演進的文學所以首先發生的是詩也是爲了由原始民族的歌謡而演進的關於此在本章裏叙述得很明白透澈並且引徵希臘的古代文學頌歌史詩的形成大都是與他們當時民間的神話與傳說有密切的關係甚至於取材於它的由此使本書所論更形明確在讀者當然可以深信無疑了</p>
<p>在性質和形式上民間文學與文人文學的不同之點據作者研究結果共有其四一是口述的寫述的二是羣衆的與個人的三是平民的貴族的四是自然的雕飾的所論大都是根據着客觀的事實在我却不須再加解釋因爲看他這四個小標題使能明白其中的一斑了從這幾點看來民間文學實有勝過文人文學的地方</p>
<p>第三章「民間文學的由來」是述民間文學是怎様的發生爲什麽發生所謂民間文學發生了民間文學以後是怎様的演進爲甚麽民間文學永久是在民間像這種種問題作者都有所發揮</p>
<p>實在是「文學未興」之時便已有「口耳之傳」的民間文學了文學的發生不外乎「情動於中而形於言」民間文學的形成當然也脫不掉此例文學之起源於詩詩起源於歌謡這歌謡大抵是最早的民間文學它底題材多關於神的方面於是「神話」便由此産生了其它如「傳說」「寓言」「彈詞」「謎語」「時調」等等的演成這大半是受了外來「佛曲」的影響與及文人文學的推進此章都有詳細的探討文學與人生的關係亦有所論及</p>
<p>第四章「民間文學的價值」這裏所述的價值是從另一方面探討得來的因爲前已說過它和文人文學在文學上的地位是相等的甚至於趨過一是可以作「致有上的補助」二是「學術上的參考」三是「行政上的憑藉」四是「生活的調劑」所論均有見地使我們明白民間文學不但本身已有相當的價值就是别一方面它也佔了不少重要的地位</p>
<p>民間文學的範圍我們當然應該要弄清楚作者將第五章「民間文學的分類」用精銳的眼光正確的目標而來辨别眞正屬於民間文學的類别例如</p>
<p>第一類「故事」可分爲四種一神話「含有宗敎性的故事」二傳說「含有歷史性的故事」三趣話「含有滑稽性的故事」四寓言「含有諷剌性的故事」</p>
<p>第二類「歌謡」也分爲四種一童謡「兒童徒有聲歌的歌謡」二山歌「成人徒有聲歌的歌謡」三時調「一般有章曲的歌謡」四謎語「一般有隱示的歌謡」第三類「唱本一僅分爲兩種一唱詞「有唱白無演的唱本」二唱曲「有唱白有演的唱本」</p>
<p>作者這様的分類是否確當我們可不要加以强判但至少可以給讀者一個系統的槪念同時第六章「民間文學的作品」便是根據着上面的分類而引徵出來的作品如果我們把它參照起來讀更其容易明白每篇引文裏作者都加以詳細的客觀的叙述及解釋所以這章竟佔全書四分之三的篇幅在數量的分配上未免不十分均匀這似乎是本書上僅有的缺點</p>
<p>本書雖然名爲「槪說」但中國文人向來對於民間文學忽視的面現在竟能發現研究此項文學的這様稍有系統的書委實是值得我們的注意這好似黄泥混合的金已有人不惜寳貴的時間與精力在那裏發掘所獲得的多寡與及是否可以掬得到「金」當然是别一個問題不過作者現在所實行的這步工作我們是值得讚美的應當加以注意因爲它對於研究或是好愛民間文學的人多少有相當的指示也可以作一種參考</p>
<p>中國所有的祇不過一些民間文學的搜集而已關於這種研究的書册怕恐要算楊君的創始僅在這一點上也足夠我在此介紹的了</p>

<h3 id="e6">Tianjin Post Office Labor Strike <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Situation Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>Tianjin, 28th Morning: Postmaster A Liangxi met with the striking representatives Zhou Bingwen and Han Weixian and declared that if they could resume work, they would be given a temporary subsidy of three or two yuan in accordance with the Beijing method. Zhou et al. stated that the Tianjin post office workers' demands were different from those in Beijing, and their positions were also different. The Tianjin post office strike could not be resolved by the Beijing method, resulting in no results. At noon, the strike committee issued a written warning to A Liangxi, stating that since the General Post Office had given him full authority to resolve the matter, if he did not give a satisfactory response quickly, he would be undermining the overall situation, which would lead to other actions by the trade union. The Postmaster should be responsible. At the same time, a telephone call was received from the Beijing Postal Workers' Union, stating that although the military and police authorities had mediated and work had resumed, the conditions for resolution had not yet been agreed upon. The Tianjin postal workers immediately sent representatives Li Zaiyi, Zhou Jichang, and Han Weixian to Beijing to coordinate everything. In the evening, A Liangxi sent an official letter asking whether the Tianjin postal workers' strike could be resolved in accordance with the Beijing method. He was immediately rejected and warned that if he remained stubborn and unrepentant, the union would take action to put the Postmaster in an embarrassing situation. All responsibility thereafter rested with the Postmaster. At the same time, a resolution was passed: (1) A telegram was sent to the Post Office Superintendent denying the Beijing Bureau's resolution conditions and declaring that A Liangxi's delay in the strike was intentionally undermining the labor movement. (2) It was decided that Gao Yibang and Yang Guangquan would visit the military and political authorities on the 29th to complain that A Liangxi's delay in the strike was motivated by ulterior motives and to request a fair sanction to avoid provoking other incidents that would hinder social order and security. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin, 28th: The strike situation has become increasingly serious. The Tianjin Postal Workers' Union, which was originally fighting separately from the Postal Workers' Union, has now received a telegram from the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union requesting sympathy and assistance.

<h3 id="e7">The Strike Wave in Northern France <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>The European War dealt a major blow to the economies of all countries. France, as the site of the war, suffered particularly from industrial stagnation. After the war, countries made every effort to develop industry, and were thus able to quickly return to their original state. France, however, did not focus solely on industry, so its results were slower than those of other countries. Today, however, countries that have made great efforts to develop are suffering from the harm of radical industrialization, while France has been less affected. Although the current strike wave in northern France is very dangerous, its origins lie only in disagreements between employers and workers. Radical factions are inciting it. If it is properly mediated, it can be easily resolved. It is not like the fundamental inability of factories in other countries to maintain themselves, which is dangerous. Prime Minister Tardieu said in a speech that France is in a relatively advantageous economic position at a time when world industry and commerce are declining. The people can benefit greatly. It is only necessary for labor and management to cooperate, and for the government to economize on expenditures and impose light taxes to maintain its own security. These are not empty words.</p>
<p>However, this is only to say that its strike wave is easier to handle compared to other industrialized countries. As far as the actual situation is concerned, the cost of living is also increasing, and the trend of trade stagnation is also being felt. Although France is said to be agricultural, it has gradually become industrialized. Its development has also made considerable achievements recently, but it is not as rapid as that of the United States and Japan. Therefore, its impact is not as great as that of other countries, and the phenomenon of unemployment in society is not as severe as that of other countries. However, when considering its public and private financial difficulties, the situation is similar to that of other countries. Therefore, in the future, it must act cautiously, as Tardieu said, and prevent any further internal incidents from occurring in order to overcome this difficulty. For example, although the human body has differences in strength and weakness, its symptoms are the same, and there is no other way to treat it.</p>

<p>Executive Yuan Orders Him to Stay</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zhijiang again submitted his resignation to the Executive Yuan, stating that he was accustomed to military affairs and unfamiliar with political affairs. He was ordered to preside over the opium prohibition and has been working since then. He questioned himself that his work was merely empty words and did not help the actual situation. Even under the rule of the National Government, there were those who disregarded the opium prohibition laws, which damaged national credibility and tarnished the image abroad. He felt extremely ashamed at night and was afraid to continue to muddle along. He requested that the National Government be asked to approve his resignation. Recently, he received an order from the Executive Yuan stating that the Chairman of the Committee was presiding over the affairs with a pragmatic approach, urging progress, and relying on him to do so. He hoped that he would save his energy and continue to be responsible for completing the work. The request should not be discussed. (28th Dispatch)</p>

Therefore, the powers of the organs of public opinion and the Party should be clearly divided. (28th Dispatch) (Beiping) At today's preparatory meeting of the Expansion Committee, with the participation of ten Expansion Committee members and three representatives of the Expansion Committee, it was decided that the seven basic conditions previously announced would be sent by official telegram.

<p>▲ (National Society, Cairo, 27th) Former Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas, leader of the Nationalist Party, issued a declaration today, accusing the current government of being formed illegally and urging the people not to pay taxes or obey orders from civil and military officials. Whether the Egyptian government dares to take decisive action against him by ordering Nahas' arrest is still difficult to predict, according to political circles here, because such a move could trigger an open revolution among the people, and the current government's and the King's situation is not looking good.</p>
<p>▲ (Reuters, Cairo, 28th) The declaration issued by the Nationalist Party yesterday was signed by former Prime Minister Nahas. Its preface stated that the current government has betrayed the constitution, evaded parliament, and implemented autocracy.

The current government has no right to tax the people; only when the people control their own government can they pay taxes, etc. The Prime Minister has banned newspapers from publishing this declaration.

<h3 id="e61">Candidates for Chairman of the US Republican Party <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>▲ (National Society, Washington, 27th) Since Huston resigned as Chairman of the National Republican Party, his successor has not yet been determined. However, President Hoover's faction has internally decided that Fess will temporarily step forward to preside over party affairs. However, if Fess cannot meet the expectations of the public, then this position will be temporarily left vacant. The chairman of the executive committee has been determined to be Ingalls. Fess's selection has several reasons, the most important of which is that Fess has considerable connections with farmers in the Midwest. The recent debate over the new tariff bill and the Central Farmers' Bureau's methods of helping farmers have also become the focus of recent disputes. This is why the government has no choice but to seek a mediator to take responsibility for smoothing things out, and Fess is the only one who can do this. Judging from the current public sentiment, Hoover's decision this time is recognized by the party members. The concern is that there are many people who want to obtain this position, and it is not known whether there will be any changes when they compete for it in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Difficulties in Compiling Japan's New Budget <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>▲ (Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 28th) The policy for compiling the budget for the sixth year of Showa was decided at the cabinet meeting on the 18th. All rebellious forces will eventually be eliminated, and their future difficulties can be foreseen. Based on my observation of the status of overseas Chinese and confirmed by previous revolutionary history, I can conclude that their failure is inevitable. Overseas Chinese, whether as laborers or businessmen, have suffered unspeakable oppression from imperialism and capitalism. In various ports in the Americas and Southeast Asia, Chinese laborers were initially used for their diligence and hard work, but once their businesses were successful, they were rejected or expelled. Under these cruel circumstances, overseas Chinese unanimously hoped that the motherland would have a strong government that could be relied upon for protection and to eliminate all harsh treatment. Fortunately, the Premier advocated revolution, upheld the Three Principles of the People, and aimed to achieve freedom and equality in the international community, abolish unequal treaties, and rescue oppressed compatriots. All overseas Chinese unanimously supported him, either destroying their homes to alleviate difficulties or sacrificing themselves to save the country, devoting all their efforts to assisting the Premier in seeking the revitalization and political unification of the motherland. Therefore, the success of the revolution was due to the greatness of the Premier's ideology, but the sincere support of overseas Chinese was also a powerful factor. Now, Wang Jingwei's collaboration with warlords to undermine the party and the central government in order to seek personal rights and territory is tantamount to sacrificing the Chinese Kuomintang, created through the Premier's painstaking efforts, and the small amount of benefits gained through the sacrifices of countless overseas Chinese, in one fell swoop. His insane and reckless actions have greatly disappointed the people of the country and all overseas Chinese, and he has lost popular support. There is no reason for him to succeed. From this, the party and government's future can be viewed with optimism, and I hope that all comrades will make extra efforts. The meeting adjourned after the report.</p>
<p>▲ At 10:00 AM on the same day, the National Government held a Premier Sun Yat-sen Memorial Week ceremony. Tan Yankai, Gu Yingfen, Zhu Peide, Enhe Batu, Zhang Nanxian, Chen Yi, Chen Shaokuan, Li Jinlun, Zhu Jingnong, Chen Yu, Zhang Wohua, Wu Siyu, and officials from the civil and military affairs departments, totaling more than 200 people, attended. After Chairman Tan Yankai led the ceremony, Secretary Qian Changzhao gave a political report, as follows: "The military victories at the front lines include the successive recapture of Haozhou, Luyi, and Zhecheng. The government has separately commended the officers and soldiers who contributed to this. They have been working day and night at the front lines, exposed to gunfire and bullets. The recent weather has been extremely hot, making it even harder. Compared to them, we in the rear are too comfortable and relaxed. I hope that everyone will make special efforts. As for the rebellious troops of Yan and Feng, they have repeatedly launched unsuccessful counterattacks, and their strength is waning, and a complete collapse is imminent. The enlarged meeting in Beiping and all other absurd measures are truly digging their own graves. In short, the elimination of the reactionary forces is imminent. What should be given special attention now is the suffering of the people and how to restore their vitality. This is the most important and urgent problem to solve at present. Preparations must be made before the military is settled, so that they can be effectively implemented after the military is over. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce has proposed a plan to facilitate transportation, which is divided into eight points: (1) reorganization of water transport; (2) reorganization of land transport; (3) improvement of domestic and foreign intermodal transport; (4) strict prohibition of excessive charges for transportation fees; (5) preferential treatment for the transportation of special products; (6) crackdown on pilferage and leakage during loading and unloading; (7) defense against bandits along the way; (8) improvement of transshipment and storage. The above eight points are deeply and significantly related to the future of industry, and after being submitted by the Executive Yuan to the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications for review, they were sent to the National Government together with the review opinions of the two ministries. The State Council decided last Friday to transfer them to the Executive Yuan to instruct the relevant departments to take responsibility for implementation. Now that the military situation is gradually being settled, if this plan can be actively planned and implemented in order, it will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. Ms. Liu Manqing, an official of this government, set out from Beijing last year, passed through Xikang, and entered Tibet. She fell ill on the way and encountered many difficulties. After arriving in Tibet, she met with the Dalai Lama and other important figures in Tibet, and the Dalai Lama and others became more clear about the situation in the central government. This time, Ms. Liu took the route through India and returned to Beijing last week. The journey was very difficult, but she was very courageous and consistent, and the result was successful. This spirit is worthy of admiration and respect. We believe that Ms. Liu's courage will certainly be increased after this success, and that she will be able to work for the party and the country in the future based on this spirit and courage."</p>
<h3 id="e66">Sino-Russian Conference Faces Many Obstacles <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Harbin Correspondence on the 22nd. Since the expansion of the scope of the Sino-Russian Conference was proposed, the Central Government has instructed Mo Dehui to limit the scope of the expansion. However, recent contacts with the Russian side have still been insincere. In addition to demanding that consular and commercial treaties be resolved simultaneously, they are also considering an agreement on issues such as consular protection rights and the exchange of navigation rights on the Songhua, Heilongjiang, and Ussuri rivers, which is close to insatiable extortion. Their intention seems to be to indefinitely delay the conference, observe the situation in China, and then take advantage of the opportunity to negotiate with us. Therefore, Mo Dehui and Karakhan have met many times in the past half-month, and each time there have been heated debates. The negotiations on the 20th of this month were particularly intense, and no results were achieved after a long time. Also, regarding the purpose of the conference, Mo solemnly stated to Karakhan that all disputes between China and Russia arose because of the Eastern Railway problem, and in order to dispel misunderstandings among the people of the two countries, it was necessary to first resolve the Eastern Railway problem. Other issues could be resolved as ancillary matters after the Eastern Railway problem. Karakhan insisted that the conference must be based on the Boli record and select the more important issues related to international relations for negotiation, and he was unwilling to make any concessions on the rest. Therefore, the preparatory meeting for the expanded negotiations has been shelved again. Also, members of our delegation in Russia are being secretly monitored by Russian spies and their actions are extremely restricted. Mo is waiting for instructions from the Central Government and plans to temporarily not leave Russia in order to seek a turnaround in the stalemate at the appropriate time.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Qingdao Rickshaw Puller Labor Unrest Expands <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>▲ Armed Police Surround the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>▲ All Petitioning Rickshaw Pullers Arrested</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence. The Qingdao rickshaw pullers' strike was triggered by the rickshaw companies' rent increase. On the 24th, the city government issued a special notice ordering the rickshaw pullers to pay rent according to the rate of three jiao and eight fen, and setting a deadline for resuming work immediately, otherwise they would be punished for disrupting the security of the rear. The rickshaw pullers ignored this. The next day, the Public Security Bureau dispatched hundreds of armed police officers to enforce the order. Those who did not comply were immediately arrested. Therefore, since the 25th, a small number of rickshaw pullers have resumed work, but the majority have remained at home, still refusing to yield. On the morning of the 26th, at 8:00 AM, about 130 to 140 rickshaw puller representatives successively arrived at the Municipal Party Headquarters to petition for two things: (1) that the rent remain at three jiao, and (2) that the arrested rickshaw puller union committee members and rickshaw pullers be released. Zhou Shenfu, secretary of the Training Department, came out to persuade them, saying that this matter should wait for the city government to resolve it. The rickshaw pullers were preparing to go home when, unexpectedly, as soon as they left the party headquarters gate, more than 20 people were arrested by armed police officers and sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention. The remaining rickshaw pullers did not dare to go out. At this time, the party headquarters was surrounded by armed police officers with guns and ammunition. Those leaving the party headquarters had to be interrogated before being released. At 2:05 PM, Zhu Xia, the second captain of the security team, and Ren Dongying, the chief inspector, suddenly led hundreds of security team members, fully armed, and dozens of plainclothes police officers with ropes in hand, rushing in and surrounding the party headquarters first. Zhu and Ren then led more than a dozen armed police officers inside to search. When Li Yizhong and Wu Rencang, two members of the Municipal Guidance Committee, saw the serious situation and feared that it would trigger an accident, they rushed to the auditorium to contact Zhu Xia, saying that they would deal with it after discussing it with Mayor Ge. Zhu Xia refused, saying that he was obeying the mayor's orders. After arguing for a long time with no result, Wu and Li said, "Do whatever you want." Zhu then ordered the police officers guarding the front and back doors to load their weapons and arrest all the rickshaw pullers, tying them up with ropes and sending them to the Public Security Bureau. It is said that the Municipal Party Headquarters is deeply dissatisfied with this and fears that the unrest will inevitably expand as a result. (27th)</p>

<p>Important News Two</p>
<h3 id="e68">Communist Bandits Flee From Ganzhou, Xingan, and Fengcheng <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Lu Dipin Deploys Troops to Encircle and Suppress on Three Sides</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence. The Communist bandits led by Huang Gonglue, Luo Binghui, and others, after capturing Yongfeng, went down the Gan River from western Jiangxi and captured Xingan on the 22nd. On the 23rd, they occupied Qingjiang and Zhangshu, which are located at the intersection of the Yuan River and the Gan River, and are connected to Nanchang by the Nanzhang Road automobile and the Gan River steamer. It is an important town in western Jiangxi, only more than 20 li away from Qingjiang County. Therefore, on the morning of the 24th, it was also captured by the Communist bandits. According to a person from the highway bureau who came from Zhangshu, at about 7:00 AM on the 24th, more than 2,000 Communist bandits with more than 1,000 guns, and the rest being spearmen, attacked Zhangzhen. The official army retreated to Fengcheng (120 li from the city) for strategic reasons. All the staff of the Zhang Station of the highway bureau also retreated to that place. Later, a phone call was received from Fengcheng stating that the Communist bandits continued to advance to the Tuochuanpu area, more than 20 li from Fengcheng, on the morning of that day. Zhu Yaohua, the brigade commander of the 54th Brigade, was commanding the battle fiercely with the bandits in Fengcheng. Commander-in-Chief Lu, after receiving the report, ordered Brigade Commander Zhu to advance bravely and telegraphed the two regiments of Yu Yi in Fuzhou, the 52nd Brigade in Xiajiang, and the new 13th Division in Jishui to quickly go down the Gan River to the east to cut off the bandits' rear. The Wang Brigade stationed in Jiujiang and on the Nanxun Road was also ordered to dispatch a part to the province to set off at double speed. From the night before last to last night, machine guns and artillery were constantly passing by. The small wheel on the Gan River was traveling on the water, and the car on the Nanzhang Road was setting off on the land. The transportation of bullets and weapons was also very busy. Nanchang is the capital of the province and its relationship is very important. In addition to having sentries in various places, the Garrison Headquarters, the Security Office, and the Public Security Bureau have also dispatched troops to patrol day and night, so the area is very peaceful. Also, in order to stabilize the people's hearts, the Garrison Headquarters specially executed by firing squad seven male and female robbers and a number of Communists who were captured in the city's Xiaotaohua Alley this morning in the Daxiao Factory in order to quiet the area. (25th)</p>
<p>In another report, after the bandits Huang and Luo invaded Fengcheng, Commander-in-Chief Lu telegraphed to dispatch troops to encircle and suppress them. Commander Lu recently received a telegram from Dai Yue reporting, "Chairman Lu Junjian mi, the staff led Xiao's camp to the vicinity of Xingan at midnight last night, and completely recovered Xingan County at 2:00 AM this morning, capturing countless prisoners. A detailed report will be sent later. I, Dai Yue, report this good news first, with sincerity." At the same time, a long-distance telephone call was received from Fengcheng reporting that the small group of bandits who had fled from Xingan to Zhangshu yesterday (25th) had now been recovered by the 52nd Brigade of the 18th Division. The 54th Brigade had advanced from Chongren and Fengcheng. The bandits south of Tuochuanpu were defeated by the 53rd Brigade and retreated into Zhangshu. They were currently kidnapping and extorting ransom, preparing to escape, but the three brigades of Dai, Wang, and Zhu had all arrived at their destinations and were encircling the bandits on three sides, and they would definitely be eliminated in Zhangshu and Qingjiang. After this news spread, the people's hearts were greatly stabilized. It was heard that in order to thoroughly eliminate the Communist bandits, Commander-in-Chief Lu also telegraphed He Jian, requesting that he send Liu Jianxu's division to be stationed in western Jiangxi. Liu's division and Li Bingguo's regiment advanced from Pingxiang to Yuanzhou, Zhang Gouzhong's regiment took over the defense of Pingxiang, and Deng Ying's division specialized in suppressing the Communist bandits on the Gan River. A few days ago, Zhu De and Huang Gonglue led the false 4th Army and Duan Qifeng's false 20th Army to besiege the Jishui Taihe area, but they were all defeated by Deng's division. The bandits were killed by Deng's division, ensuring the safety of Jishui. As for the northern Jiangxi area, after the 105th and 106th regiments of the 5th Brigade were transferred to Zhangshu, Director He dispatched another large army to be stationed in the Jiujiang area for coordination.

<h3 id="e69">Recently Reorganized Troops in Hunan Province <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha states that the campaign against the Guangxi faction in Hunan Province has concluded. Currently, all efforts are focused on suppressing bandits and communists, as well as rounding up scattered deserters in various counties. He Jian has established a reorganization committee, dispatching personnel to various locations to oversee the process. Each rifle will be compensated with thirty yuan to prevent the deserters from becoming bandits and harming the local populace. Furthermore, a significant number of troops that did not flee to Guangxi with the Guangxi forces include those under Li Xuan, Li Zemin, Tang Zheming, Yan Renyi, and Li Guojun. These remnant troops are mostly from Hunan and have lingered along the Hunan border, unwilling to flee far with the Guangxi forces. He Jian has decided to adopt a combined approach of suppression and appeasement based on the severity of their situation for these desperate and homeless remnants, reorganizing them accordingly. The recent reorganizations of various units are detailed below:</p>
<p>▲ Li Xuan's Unit: Li Xuan was originally a regimental commander under Luo Fanying of the Sixteenth Division, stationed in Baoqing. When the Guangxi forces entered Hunan and seized Hengzhou, Li unexpectedly rebelled in Baoqing. After the Guangxi forces retreated, Li concentrated his forces in Chayou, Xiangdong, to impede the Fourth Route Army's pursuit, resulting in considerable casualties. Eventually, Li Xuan planned to lead his troops to Yongzhou, but the officers and soldiers were mostly unwilling, advocating for surrender to He Jian and gathering in Chaling, refusing to move. Realizing that the situation was hopeless, Li fled alone. The troops, led by Regimental Commander Li Bingguo, formally issued a telegram of repentance and surrender. After inspection and verification by Liu Jianxu, Commander of the Nineteenth Division, it was found that there were still over 1,100 rifles and over 1,500 personnel. He Jian approved the reorganization of the unit into the Training Regiment of the Nineteenth Division, stationed in Cha for training, with Li Bingguo as the regimental commander.</p>
<p>▲ Tang Zheming's Unit: Tang Zheming was the main culprit in enticing the Guangxi forces to enter Hunan. His original force consisted of over 5,000 men. In the Battle of Changsha, over 1,000 were captured by the Fourth Route Army. In the Battle of Liyou, over 2,000 more were lost. In the end, only over 1,000 remnant troops fled to Dong'an. Tang Zheming and Tang Shengming also deserted, and the troops were led by Regimental Commanders Li Guoqiang and Wang Kuntao, retreating to Huabiao in Wugang to surrender to Luo Fanying, Commander of the Sixteenth Division. Luo returned to Changsha, and after ascertaining the officers and soldiers' sincerity, he reported to He Jian for approval. The unit was reorganized into the Ninety-first Regiment of the Forty-sixth Brigade of the Sixteenth Division, with Li Guoqiang as the regimental commander and Wang Kuntao as the deputy regimental commander, and moved to Wugang for reorganization and training.</p>
<p>▲ Li Guojun's Unit: Li was originally under Chen Hanzhang. He rebelled this spring, killing Chen. He then fled. His troops were led by Xiong Pinjun. After the Guangxi forces entered Hunan, Li rose again, killing Chen Fangjia (Chen Hanzhang's younger brother). He led his troops to occupy Hongjiang, Zhijiang, Jingxian, and Xupu, and was appointed a brigade commander by Li Zongren. Because He Jian regarded him as repeatedly rebellious and unruly, he dispatched Luo Fanying, Commander of the Sixteenth Division, to suppress him. Luo's division had already advanced from Wugang and Chengbu towards Hongjiang. Knowing he could not win, Li Guojun then surrendered to He Jian, and claimed that Li Zemin and Yan Renyi, each leading over a thousand men, had fled into Xiangxi, Huaning and Jingxian. Li Guojun offered to lead his troops to assist the provincial army in eliminating Li Zemin and Yan Renyi to atone for their crimes. He Jian initially refused, but after Dai Douyuan, Commander of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression, explained the advantages and disadvantages—that Yuanjing's terrain was treacherous and a breeding ground for bandits, and that failing to accept their surrender would risk Li and Li Zemin and Yan Renyi joining forces, making it even more difficult to suppress them—He Jian agreed to reorganize the unit into the First Column of the Xiangxi Bandit Suppression Command, with Li Guojun as the column commander, concentrating in Hongjiang to assist in suppressing the remnants of Li and Yan. Li took office in Hongjiang on the 21st. (Dated the 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e70">○ Graduation Ceremony of the Seventh Class of the Wuhan Military Academy <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>▲ Liu Wendao's Address on Behalf of the Central Government</p>
<p>▲ Ying Qin Personally Awards Graduation Certificates</p>
<p>The Wuhan Branch of the Central Army Military Academy held the graduation ceremony for the seventh class of students on July 26th at the school's parade ground. Liu Wendao, representing the Central Government, delivered an address, and He Yingqin, representing the National Government, personally awarded graduation diplomas. The ceremony was quite grand. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Arrangement of the Venue: A large, colorful archway was erected in front of the school gate, inscribed with the words "Graduation Ceremony." The school was decorated with national flags and slogans. The rostrum was set up on the north side of the venue, surrounded by cloth banners with slogans such as "Promote the Revolutionary Spirit of Whampoa" and "Graduating Students are the Basic Cadres of the Revolutionary Army." A large dining table was placed on the stage, displaying graduation diplomas wrapped in red paper, totaling fifteen bundles for the first to thirteenth infantry teams, the artillery and engineering teams, and the engineering team.</p>
<p>▲ Proceedings of the Ceremony: At 7:00 AM, all the seventh-class students of the school arrived at the venue. Liu Wendao, representing the Central Government, He Yingqin, representing the National Government, and Qian Dajun, the school's Education Director, arrived one after another. At 7:15 AM, a military parade was held. The parade concluded at 7:20 AM, followed by a march-past. The graduation ceremony officially began at 7:40 AM, presided over by He Yingqin and emceed by Gu Yuqi. He Yingqin distributed the graduation diplomas to each student, which took twenty minutes to complete. ▲ Liu Wendao's Speech (Abridged): The center of the revolution is in the Party Army, and the center of the Party Army is in the military academy. Since you are undertaking the task of being at the center of the revolution, you should be models for revolutionary soldiers, so that the armies of the entire country are united under your command. Historically, all countries have only one military academy, so the command of the entire country's military orders is unified, and the training of military strength is centralized. Our country's Central Military Academy also adopts this method, but our country's army is a revolutionary army, and its responsibilities are heavier than those of any other country's army. I hope that after you graduate, you will make special efforts and show particular affection and unity towards your comrades, and eliminate all counter-revolutionaries.</p>
<p>▲ He Yingqin's Speech (Abridged): Gentlemen, upon graduating from the military academy, you will be assigned to various armies for practical training. Based on my recent observations at the front lines, soldiers should pay attention to "night combat," "fortifications," "hygiene," and "discipline" in order to cope with the current military campaign against the rebels. From now on, I hope you will exert the spirit of sacrifice and strive for the Party and the country, be faithful followers of the late President, and live up to the painstaking efforts of President Jiang in founding this school, and to the earnest intentions of Director Qian in training you.</p>
<p>▲ Qian Dajun's Speech (Abridged): You have been at the school for a year, and now that you are about to be assigned to different locations for practical training, I feel a sense of reluctance to part. In the future, you will all strive for the country in different directions. I would like to offer the four phrases "aspire to diligence in learning, observe discipline, be diligent in duties, and implement the Three Principles of the People" as parting words, and wish you all progress in your future endeavors.</p>
<p>▲ Students Read Oath: After Qian Dajun's speech, Huang Changgu, a member of the provincial government, delivered a speech. After the speech, student representatives respectfully read the oath, which read: "The Divine Land is vast, and the Jianghan region is grand and abundant, strategically located upstream as the source of the revolution. Heroes gather, and the Party and the nation are the backbone. The branch school was born here one year ago. At the time of graduation, the smoke of war is everywhere, and our responsibilities are heavy. We must carry on our military virtues and bravely advance, glorifying the martyrs and marching forward fearlessly." (July 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Resolution of the Dispute Over the Head of the Fujian Finance Department <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>▲ The Anti-He Wave in the Party Subsides</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou states that after the appointment of He Gonggan as the new acting head of the Fujian Provincial Finance Department and special commissioner of finance was announced, two instructors from the provincial party headquarters, Gan Yun and Feng Ji'an, opposed the appointment on the grounds that He was an important figure in the State-Nationalist faction. Party branches at all levels echoed the opposition, and the city was plastered with slogans and leaflets calling for He's expulsion, creating a very serious situation. The provincial party headquarters and the provincial government telegraphed the Central Government and the National Government for instructions. However, He Gonggan himself insisted that he had no connection with the State-Nationalist faction and adopted a very firm attitude. On the morning of the 21st, amidst a pervading atmosphere of opposition, he resolutely took over the Finance Department and the Special Commissioner's Office, reorganizing the department and replacing various staff members. As previously reported, personnel holding nominal or concurrent positions were also dismissed, totaling over seventy people from both the department and the office, saving over 17,000 yuan in expenses each month. At the same time, he raised 100,000 yuan in cash from a certain source to cover current military and administrative expenses. Regarding the future direction of financial reorganization, He stated that all national and local taxes would be increased, and the amount compared to the assessment implemented through open bidding. Responsible personnel would not be allowed to privately transfer or take over operations, secretly form partnerships to share dividends, or collect subsidies. All such abuses should be vigorously eliminated to convert private gains into public benefits. According to this method, an additional 300,000 yuan could be increased each month. However, opponents were greatly shaken that He had taken office without waiting for a reply from the Central Government and decided to convene a joint meeting of various party district branches and mass organizations on the morning of the 22nd to discuss countermeasures. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 21st, Hu Hanmin, a member of the Central Committee, replied in a telegram, stating that when Chen Zhenru was retained as the deputy director of the Political Department of the Commander-in-Chief at the 91st Political Conference in May of the 16th year of the Republic, a resolution included that He Gonggan and others were recently striving for the Three Principles of the People, and their achievements were known to the Central Government. All those who cherish the late President's magnanimity and the necessity of concentrating talents in the Party should not seize floating rumors and facts, strip useful talents, and lightly attack the enemy. For this reason, the Central Political Conference believes that Comrade He and others should summon the courage to make a self-reflection, redouble their efforts in their original posts, etc. Upon receiving the inquiry, a portion of the original document was released and reported. The provincial government immediately turned the original telegram over to various newspapers for publication, so the atmosphere of the 22nd changed abruptly, and the anti-He movement suddenly subsided. The slogans and leaflets posted in the city were also cleaned up by the Public Security Bureau. In the afternoon, Yang Shuzhuang specially invited the committee members to the provincial government to talk with He Gonggan, dispel misunderstandings, and foster feelings. Gan Yun and Feng Ji'an are scheduled to take the Jiahe steamer to Shanghai on the 23rd and then to Beijing to report on the reorganization of the provincial party headquarters to the Central Government. The dispute over the head of the Fujian Finance Department, which lasted for a week, has thus come to an end. (July 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Rampant Banditry in Su County, Northern Anhui <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu states that Su County in northern Anhui, located at a key point along the Jinpu Railway, is adjacent to Xiaoxian County in Jiangsu and Yongcheng County in Henan, both notoriously infested with bandits. Over the years, accumulated bandits have wreaked havoc, causing great suffering to the local population. Although repeated suppression efforts have been conducted by the military, police, and local militias, bandits return as soon as the forces leave, and the area has never been pacified. Recently, since the outbreak of the Henan War, bandits have taken advantage of the opportunity to rise again. In early May, bandits in the Dafang Temple area successively broke through many stockaded villages. They were scattered by the local police and militia forces, but in early July, bandits in the Linyu district of the county, incited by communists, rose up in succession in Houlou, Xulou, Qiianhouying, Taitousi and other places on the 7th, 8th, and 9th days, gathering two to three hundred people, robbing, looting, burning, and killing in an extremely rampant manner. The district sent the first and second teams of the People's Self-Defense Corps to Zoulou, Youzha and other places in the northwest to block and defend, while the head of the local militia personally led troops to Houlou to cooperate with the Baishan district self-defense corps to jointly suppress the bandits. The bandits were repelled at Xiangshuibiao and Yeliuhu, and were then pursued to Taitousi before they were scattered. Not long after, six to seven hundred fierce bandits from Yongcheng in eastern Henan infiltrated the Baishan district, occupied Cheji in the northwest of the district, and became very rampant. On the 22nd, Zhao, the head of the Baishan district militia, reported to the county, and County Magistrate Wei Zhanyuan ordered the headquarters of the County People's Self-Defense Corps to immediately summon the self-defense corps from each district to jointly suppress the bandits. The headquarters of the county militia immediately mobilized the self-defense corps from the five southern districts and the mortar team from Jishi Village to launch a vigorous suppression. The county garrison also sent Shao, the platoon leader of the second battalion, to lead the self-defense corps from Baishan, Linyu and other districts to meet and attack the bandits. The bandits engaged in a fierce battle with the militia on the 23rd in Wenzhuang and Xiaozhouzhuang of Liuguji, located on the border of Baishan and Suixi. The bandits were overwhelmed and collapsed. Platoon Leader Shao did not pursue them due to limited ammunition. Several soldiers were injured or killed in this battle. The county garrison and the self-defense corps from each district are adopting a joint encirclement strategy to annihilate the bandits as soon as possible. (July 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e73">Pre-Decision Points for the Civil Code's Sections on Inheritance and Kinship <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Review Opinions of the Central Political Council</p>
<p>Hu Hanmin, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Lin Sen, Vice President, previously submitted several points that should be decided first regarding the Civil Code's sections on Inheritance and Kinship to the Central Political Council. The Central Political Council handed them over to the Legal Affairs Group for review, and they were revised and passed in accordance with the review opinions at the 236th meeting. The review opinion document is extracted as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Points to be decided first in Inheritance Law: First point: Should the inheritance of the lineage be stipulated? The inheritance of the lineage need not be stipulated. (Explanation) The system of lineage inheritance is detailed in the Rites of Zhou and is a relic of the feudal era. There is a distinction between the major lineage and the minor lineage. The temple of the major lineage, which does not move for a hundred generations, is called the lineage. The temple of the minor lineage, which moves after five generations, is called the ancestral shrine. This is the original meaning of the two characters lineage and shrine. The major lineage presides over the ancestral temple sacrifices and cannot be without an heir. Therefore, the minor lineage can be extinguished, but the major lineage cannot be extinguished. This is where the system of establishing an heir comes from. Since the abolition of feudalism and the demise of the clan system, the organization of society is based on the family, not the clan. Each family presides over the ancestral sacrifices and is not unified. Those who have joint family sacrifices are presided over by the clan head, not necessarily the heir of the lineage. The system of lineage head presiding over sacrifices has not been abolished, but the names of major and minor lineages have no place to attach, and the saying of establishing an heir for the major lineage has long been a false term. This is the first reason why lineage inheritance has no reason to continue to exist in terms of the system. According to old regulations, both the eldest and second sons should establish heirs. What is called the eldest son today may not belong entirely to the major lineage, let alone the second son. Moreover, among close relatives of the same father, there is the practice of adopting two lineages at the same time. As a result, the son of the eldest son may also be the heir of the second son, which is contrary to the ancient meaning of the minor lineage being extinguished. It only retains the name without the substance. This is the second reason why lineage inheritance has no reason to continue to exist in name. Lineage inheritance focuses on sacrifices, so those who establish an heir are limited to men, and women have no right to establish an heir. Those who are adopted as heirs are also limited to men, and women have no right to be an heir. The emphasis on men and the contempt for women can be seen here, which is clearly incompatible with modern trends. This is the third reason why lineage inheritance has no reason to continue to exist in terms of gender equality. Based on the above reasons, it is believed that lineage inheritance need not be stipulated. As for the selection of an heir, it is originally the freedom of the parties concerned and should not be prohibited. It should be that both men and women can select and be selected as heirs. Second point: Is inheritance of property premised on inheritance of the lineage? Inheritance of property is not premised on inheritance of the lineage. (Explanation) According to the old laws of our country, the inheritance of property is limited to men in the direct line of descent, because it is based on the inheritance of the lineage. Therefore, those who have no sons must adopt an heir from the same clan of the same generation. As a result, daughters, even if they are close, and wives who remain faithful, are not allowed to inherit property. Even though a wife who remains faithful may temporarily inherit her husband's share, she still needs to rely on the clan head to establish an heir. All of these unequal systems between men and women are now known to be unworkable. As for direct ascendants, because the old laws prohibited children and grandchildren from having separate property, ascendants would not have property to inherit if their children and grandchildren were alive. But now the situation has changed, and the prohibition of private property of the young has gradually been abolished. If they die without descendants, it would be unreasonable to establish an heir to inherit the property without allowing the parents or grandparents to have this right. Therefore, in today's situation, inheritance of property should not be premised on lineage inheritance. Third point: The scope and order of heirs, and the shares to be inherited. (1) Heirs are divided into two types: legal heirs and designated heirs. (2) Legal heirs, in addition to the spouse, are determined in the following order: (1) Direct descendants; (2) Parents; (3) Siblings; (4) Grandparents. (3) Children born out of wedlock who have been raised or recognized shall have the same rights as children born in wedlock in inheriting property. (4) Among legal heirs in the first order, regardless of gender, those with closer kinship take precedence. (5) If a legal heir in the first order dies or loses the right of inheritance before the inheritance begins, their direct descendants shall inherit their share. (6) When there is more than one legal heir, they shall inherit equally regardless of gender, unless otherwise specified. (7) The order of inheritance for adopted children is the same as for natural children, but their share of inheritance is one-half that of natural children. (8) In the absence of direct descendants, a designated heir may be appointed for all or part of the property. (9) Both the designator and the designee are not restricted by gender. (Explanation) According to the old laws of our country, the inheritance of property is limited to men in the direct line of descent. This adheres to the saying of lineage inheritance and takes the inheritance of the lineage as a prerequisite for the inheritance of property. Therefore, those who have no sons must adopt someone from the same clan who is of the same generation. Upon further investigation, even parents, grandparents, and siblings, and even children who remain at birth, cannot participate in the inheritance, which goes against human nature. Apart from the right of women to inherit property, which has already been decided by the Second National Congress and should be incorporated into the principles, it is specially stipulated that other relatives in addition to direct descendants can also be heirs in order to conform to the current trend. The scope and order of other heirs (details of the spouse are different) determined by various countries outside of direct descendants are not consistent. The following is a brief description of the heirs outside of direct descendants and spouses: Germany stipulates that parents and their descendants, grandparents and their descendants, great-grandparents and their descendants, and remote ancestors and their descendants are all legal heirs, and among them, the order is that parents and their descendants take precedence, followed by grandparents and their descendants, and so on. Switzerland stipulates that parents (those who died before are represented by their direct descendants) and grandparents (those who died before are represented by their direct descendants) are all legal heirs, and among them, the order is that parents take precedence. Brazil stipulates that direct ascendants and collateral relatives within six degrees of kinship (whether those who died before can be represented by their descendants is specified in detail) are all heirs, and among them, the order is that direct ascendants take precedence. Japan stipulates that direct ascendants are heirs, and the order is that those with closer kinship take precedence. Moreover, after direct ascendants, the head of the household is also included. Soviet Russia limits the heirs to those who have been supported by the deceased for more than one year before their death and who have no ability to work and property. Examples like these are too numerous to mention. It is now planned to assess our country's national conditions and refer to foreign precedents to allow parents, siblings, and grandparents to inherit property. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Baby Oil Incidents: Jin Chengyong, director of the Yucheng Infant Hall, and others recently heard that babies in the hall were being fraudulently adopted by criminals for sale to Shanghai to be boiled into Yu Shu Shen oil and other medicines. They were greatly angered. In addition to thoroughly checking the records of the households who adopted babies, they also ordered the detective team to secretly investigate. It has now been found that a certain person in Shanghai has set up an organization in Yu Shouyi's house on West Main Street in the city, secretly ordering local women to go to the hall to adopt babies, paying 12 to 18 yuan per baby. They are secretly transported to Shanghai, and it has been found on the adoption certificates that Shi Wenxiu's printing shop has acted as a guarantor for five people in one day. The babies adopted by Pu Aixue and Gu Achun outside the South Gate are all missing. Pu and others were arrested. According to their confessions, the babies had either died or been fostered in Shanghai. Apart from sending the suspect for further investigation, they are also secretly arresting the fugitives for investigation.</p>

<p>Collapse of Buildings on Guanqian Street Injures People: Guanqian Street is now being actively widened, and shops are being demolished and rebuilt. At around 3:00 PM yesterday (the 28th), when the Qiantai Xiang Silk Store at the Zhenshanmen entrance was being demolished, it suddenly collapsed, injuring five male and female workers on the spot. The foreman hired a car to send them to Tongren Hospital on Gongyuan Road for treatment. In addition, the reconstruction of the Jinxingguan Restaurant at No. 68 Tianhougong Bridge Street inside Pingmen was sloppy last winter. At 5:00 PM yesterday (the 27th), the Jinxingguan Restaurant building suddenly collapsed, simultaneously collapsing nine neighboring shops, including Zhang Laosi's tofu shop, Yang Maotou's noodle shop, Jiang Jinfang's candy shop, a certain family's flatbread shop, He Laoqi's wonton shop, Shunhelou Restaurant, Diao Si's residence, and Zhang Laosi's tofu shop warehouse, totaling thirty rooms.</p>
<p>A Large Prison to be Built in Zhenru: Since the Shanghai Public Concession Provisional Court was reorganized into the Higher Second Branch Court by the Ministry of Justice on April 1st of this year, the West Prison, Women's Prison, Detention Center, and Civil Custody Office, where male and female criminal offenders were detained by the former Provisional Court, have been managed by two Western prison directors and deputy directors. Although the Ministry of Justice has been eager to recover the management to Chinese, the Concession authorities have refused, so it has not been recovered yet. However, the Ministry of Justice is determined to find a way to recover the Concession prisons, so it recently appointed Xie Fuzi, the prison director of the Third Jiangsu Prison, to Shanghai to prepare for the takeover. After Xie was commissioned, he first investigated the total number of prisoners and the financial situation. It was estimated that there were about 4,700 Chinese criminals and more than 700 foreigners detained in the West Prison. There were more than 170 female prisoners in the Women's Prison, and more than 50 civil custody prisoners. There were dozens of untried prisoners in the Detention Center. As for economic issues, it was estimated that the average cost for each Chinese criminal detained in the West Prison was about 150 taels of silver per year, and the average cost for each foreign criminal was about 2.5 yuan of silver per day. The above expenses were entirely paid by Chinese taxpayers. The costs for the female prisoners, untried prisoners, and civil custody prisoners were also higher than those in Jiangsu Province prisons. After Xie's investigation, he consulted with the president of the Higher Second Branch Court and the police on the takeover methods. After much discussion, it was only agreed to transfer the Detention Center, Women's Prison, and Civil Custody Office to Chinese management. Xie Prison Director then first took over the Detention Center and reported to the Ministry of Justice. After the Ministry of Justice received the report, it decided to find a solution because the West Prison could not be recovered and managed independently. It was decided to allocate more than 400,000 yuan of surplus funds that the Higher Second Branch Court received when the Provisional Court was transferred but had not yet used to purchase 150 to 160 acres of land in Zhenru, west of Shanghai, to build a large prison that could accommodate 3,000 prisoners to detain the tried and untried prisoners of the Special Zone Local Court in the future. Xie Fuzi has been commissioned to design the prison. After Xie was commissioned, he has been looking for suitable land. Once it is purchased, the perimeter wall will be built first, and the plan is to build in four phases. The first phase will be to build a place to accommodate 700 prisoners. Once it is satisfactory, construction will continue in succession.</p>

<p>The Su-Xi Water Police jointly suppressed the lake bandits who hijacked the ships at Wangyewan near Hengjing in the Su area on the 23rd. The gang of lake bandits from Henan, Pudong, and Jiangbei hijacked the "Dalu Flying Tiger" passenger ships, kidnapped Wang Wusheng, the captain of the 8th team of the 2nd Water Police District, and Inspector Huang, killed two guards, seized more than a dozen guns, and kidnapped twenty-five male and female passengers. After receiving the report, Mao Mujun, the chief of the 2nd Water Police District, immediately led the police to Hengjing. The day before yesterday, he and Gong Guoliang, the chief of the 3rd District, convened an emergency meeting of all the teams under their jurisdiction to discuss the methods of suppression. They immediately set off separately. Yesterday morning, all the police teams arrived at Dongshan, including four shallow-water warships, more than seventy patrol boats from the 2nd and 3rd Districts, and Du Hongyi, the captain of the Wuxian Police Brigade, also led two police companies together with the Water Police Guerrilla Team, and fifty patrol boats also arrived at the same time. Mao and Gong, the two district chiefs, ordered an immediate suppression to completely eliminate them. The leader of the lake bandits, Zhong Zhaokui, after hijacking at Wangyewan, fled to West Taihu with the remaining bandits and joined forces with Wang Zhongyi, Peng Qingshan, Wang Rong and other bandits to strengthen their forces. After receiving the information, the 3rd District of Zhejiang Water Police immediately sent two detectives, Wu Rongshan and Zhang Zhi, to Caogang, Su Province, on the 26th to investigate. They encountered the bandits and were killed. The Zhejiang Water Police have now sent a team to Caogang to suppress them. Salt police and smugglers fought fiercely. Recently, a gang of salt smugglers from Pudong smuggled more than ninety loads of illegal salt from overseas, loaded them on three boats, and sailed from Yangcheng Lake into Taihu Lake to sell them to villages along the lake. On the 24th, at Zhifangquan in the Xi area, Dai Shoushan, the captain of the 7th Anti-smuggling Brigade of the Su Five Districts stationed there, went to pursue them and telegraphed the 7th Brigade Headquarters in the city. Wu Hanzhuang, the brigade commander, immediately sent Huang Songyuan, the deputy captain of the 3rd Company, to lead eight patrol boats to Southern Spring to join the commercial patrol team to pursue the bandits in the lake. The two sides opened fire at Renzigang. The bandits' weapons were extremely sophisticated, all Mauser pistols. After an hour of fierce fighting, several bandits were killed. The bandits retreated to the east and west mountains. The police team was unable to pursue them due to the small boats and big waves. Yesterday, the situation was reported to the brigade headquarters for verification and decision. Chengsha merchants strived for the abolition of the public office donation. Most of the Jiangyin cotton yarn industry purchased cotton yarn from factories in Wuxi. The Wuxi Yarn Industry Guild used to collect a public office donation of one corner for each piece of yarn transported to Cheng. After Jiangyin yarn merchants strived for it, the public office donation was stopped in the 14th year of the Republic of China and changed to collecting one corner for each piece of yarn leaving the warehouse. However, the invoice still has the public office donation stamp. The yarn industry in the county sent a letter to the Jiangyin Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the Wuxi Chamber of Commerce for negotiation, and requested the Construction Department to order it to be stopped. After a year, it has not been resolved. The Wuxi County Government received an order from the Construction Department the day before yesterday to immediately convene the chambers of commerce of the two counties of Xi and Cheng to discuss it together and wait for a reply. County Magistrate Sun took the order and has forwarded it for notification and scheduled a meeting.</p>
<p>A factory apprentice was electrocuted to death. Shen Jingeng, a foundry apprentice at the Xiexin Machinery Foundry on Dongxin Road outside Guangfu Gate, Wuyi County (from Changzhou, 15 years old), was restless and unable to sleep at 4 o'clock in the morning yesterday because of bedbugs. He moved an electric lamp to catch the bedbugs. The insulation of the electric lamp wire was broken, and he was electrocuted and died immediately. The factory notified the deceased's father to come to Xi for coffining.</p>
<p>The dispute over corruption in the Silk Factory Engine Room Workers' Union in Xi County. Wang Xingbei, an employee of the Silk Factory Engine Room Workers' Union Engine Room Department (also known as Wu), and Xie Bin, a member of the executive committee of the union, have been illegally engaging in corruption since taking office, causing disputes. Recently, the Engine Room Department discovered 105 blank membership certificates and nine seals of various industry unions that they had privately made.

<p>The Construction Department urged the establishment of workers' clubs. Yesterday, the Construction Department instructed the magistrates of Nantong, Wuxian, Wuxi, Qidong, Chongming, Wujin, Changshu, Jiangyin, and Zhenjiang to strictly urge the factories, companies, and shops under their jurisdiction to quickly establish workers' clubs and follow the plan of the Workers' Clubs of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to be established before the end of August this year.</p>
<p>The Public Security Bureau arrested a suspect. Zheng, a member of the 7th Public Security Bureau of Zhenjiang Province, led the police to inspect the hotels last night. In rooms 23 and 25 of the Sanshan Hotel, they saw eight people wearing uniforms and carrying Mauser pistols. They questioned their origins and said that they were guards of Huai'an County, accompanying County Magistrate Wang of Huai'an to the province. County Magistrate Wang did not live in the hotel. They were ordered to take out their passports for review. They suspected they were selling a lot, so they were taken to the bureau together. After County Magistrate Wang proved it, they would be released.</p>
<p>The Xingchang Workers' Union expressed support for the Shanghai factory workers. The Xingchang Match Factory Workers' Union in Zhenkou heard from Lu Long, a representative sent by the Shanghai Xingchang Workers' Union, that they requested the factory to pay seniority wages. In addition, worker Tong Zhaosan was overworked due to work and the weather was too hot. He casually developed an illness and asked someone to replace him, but the factory refused and dismissed him from his job, which aroused the public anger of all the workers. The day before yesterday, they went on strike together and asked the higher authorities to mediate and ask for assistance. Therefore, a hearing was called yesterday to discuss assistance measures. It was decided that the workers in the Zhen factory should also go on strike. Although Wu, a member of the County Industrial Consolidation Association, tried his best to dissuade them, the workers were so motivated by righteous indignation that they refused to ease the situation and have started a strike from today.</p>

<p>Umbrella industry workers demand increased wages. There are a total of twelve umbrella shops in the city with only fifty workers. It is customary to earn fifteen texts for each umbrella pasted, and at most only fifteen umbrellas can be pasted each day, for a total of two hundred and twenty-five texts. As the cost of living is increasing day by day, it is almost impossible to maintain a living. This morning (27th), the workers in the city gathered at Minglichun Teahouse on Dongguan Street to discuss requesting the shopkeepers to increase wages, and the minimum limit must be changed from copper coins to foreign money. If the shopkeepers insist on refusing, they will all go on strike.</p>

<p>A kidnapping and injury case occurred in Xiba. Xiba is the place where the salt wheels of the Huai Salt Regiment are transferred. There are tens of thousands of local residents, and their strength in preventing bandits is extremely strong. Unexpectedly, on the evening of the 23rd, the bandits gathered a gang of more than 20 people and kidnapped Wu Bao's nephew. Bao's wife tried her best to protect him, resulting in her being injured by the bandits. That night, the salt defense camp and the salt transport escort camp gathered more than a hundred soldiers to track and pursue them, but to no avail.</p>

<p>Bandits robbed in broad daylight. After the bandits in the western countryside of Zhejiang Province were searched by the stationed Chang Constitution Regiment and the Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the bandits' courage has been greatly reduced, and most of them have fled into Jiangsu Taihu Lake and other places. However, bandits who look like vagrants and often rob roads are still heard from time to time. Xu A Jin, who made a living by selling silk, was passing through the Hengqiao area at the junction of Heping and Hejiabu, Zhejiang Province, at about 8 a.m. on the 26th when he suddenly encountered three bandits who stopped him and arbitrarily searched him. All the banknotes, eleven yuan in silver dollars, eight yuan in silver dollars, and more than thirty corners in small silver dollars were robbed.</p>

<p>A large-scale encirclement and suppression of the southwestern bandits. Song Shike, commander of the 3rd Detachment, said that the bandits in the Shuangjiehe Dongjiagang, Sunji, Dajiandun, and Huangnikan areas at the junction of He and Shu Counties extend for dozens of miles and the villages are in ruins. A large-scale pain of elimination is not enough to eradicate the root cause.

Also, Regiment Commander Cheng Yi was ordered to lead the first battalion, the first, second and third companies, the mortar and special service companies, etc. to concentrate on Yonganji and the area around Sanlankou.

It is heard that all of them have arrived at their designated locations on the 23rd. The general attack can be launched on the 24th and 25th. It is thought that it will not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop.</p>

<h3 id="e87">The Chinese Expedition Football Team Suffered a Crushing Defeat <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Lost to the Singapore Team by a Score of Three to Zero</p>
<p>丨More than 10,000 Spectators Cheered in Unison丨</p>
<p>(Singapore Communication, July 16)</p>
<p>The Chinese Expedition Football Team, which is famous throughout the country, has been retained by the local Football Association for a competition while en route to various countries in Europe and America. The competition schedule began the day before yesterday (the 13th) with a match against the Malayan Chinese United Team, which the team won. The score was two to one. Who knew that on the 16th, they would suffer a crushing defeat against the Singapore Football Team? This was truly beyond the expectations of more than 10,000 spectators, and even the team's athletes had never experienced it before. This kind of injury is no small matter and should never be forgotten. However, this matter is not entirely related to the team's own honor or disgrace. Since the team comes from the motherland, it also has a great relationship with the reputation of overseas Chinese. If they were to lose to the overseas Chinese United Team today, the matter would be insignificant. Since they are compatriots, it is not necessary to judge success or failure. But if they lose to the Singaporean teams of various colors, the matter cannot be regarded in the same light. It is found that five of the eleven team members of the Singapore team are natives, three are Europeans, and the Chinese account for the fewest. The minority team members have always had a very good reputation, and there is a hope of winning nine out of ten expeditions. The spectators at the scene all said that if the Malay team members played in today's game, they would definitely see a spectacle. The few Chinese team members present did not take it seriously. If the team could have worked together yesterday, put aside arrogance, considered their own reputation, and won glory for the overseas Chinese, then the Malay athletes would naturally not be able to shake the southern islands, and the Chinese spectators at the stadium would not have lost heart and left the stadium before the end of the game. Although failure is commonplace in military affairs, in my opinion, there are also different types of football matches: one is a crushing defeat, and the other is a narrow defeat. What is a crushing defeat? It means suffering a complete defeat and returning empty-handed. But a narrow defeat is different. It is just a defeat caused by a difference in the number of points. The team's defeat today is one of the crushing defeats and must be remedied. A Western proverb says, "Failure is the mother of success." The days ahead are long and the future is unlimited. May the team's athletes work hard and swear to avenge their previous shame. If you want to achieve this goal, you must start with the individual, first get rid of arrogance and don't have the idea that there is no one in your eyes, and then seek to unite the entire team and work together to succeed. If this is the case, then not only can you win if you advance, but you will not suffer a crushing defeat even if you retreat. I urge the Chinese team members to endure the pain and record the course of today's Chinese team's match against the Singaporean team as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e88">First Half丨One to Zero <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The location of today's game is at the Anson Road Stadium. At around 5:02, referee Strode blew the silver whistle and summoned the two armies to prepare for battle. The circle occupied by the Singapore team was in the south of the field, while the Chinese team occupied the north of the field. After the two teams deployed their formations, the Singapore team kicked off first. The team's forward rushed forward to meet the enemy ship, and then the team encountered a corner kick, so they planned to attack. When the ball was passed to the front of the enemy's goal, they shot, but unfortunately the shot was too high and passed over the circle gate. A few seconds later, the Singapore team was penalized a ball. The Chinese kicker shot quickly, but the team members were in a hurry and the ball went out of bounds. At this time, the Chinese team's athletes were full of energy, while the Singapore team could only adopt a conservative strategy to strengthen the city gate. Then the team took the opportunity to break through the enemy's momentum like a bamboo, and was blocked three times in the enemy's goal. Although Mr. Li Huitang used his famous strange foot to shoot, he failed to enter the goal because his shot was too slow and lacked courage. His ball skills were quite different from before. If Mr. Li could be as strong as before, I believe he could have won two goals in a few minutes. But unfortunately, the ball was not shot accurately, and the Singapore team launched a counterattack. The center forward shot the ball, but it was hateful that he was in a foreign land and could not stand firm. The shot was either too high over the door or crossed the side of the door. After the two teams competed with each other, they both tended to defend first and attack later. When the team attacked, they were blocked by the Malay of the Singapore team, and the forward did not get his wish. However, the Singapore team saw that the situation was not good and planned to counterattack, but unfortunately it was blocked and a corner kick was taken again. After the ball was kicked, two athletes of the Singapore team, Mr. Yahui, tried their best to attack. Although they suffered all kinds of setbacks, their ambition was still undiminished, and the opponent could not do anything about it. However, the right wing of the team was also extremely noisy and could not come forward to show their skills against the enemy. At this time, the ball skills were quite impressive. Before long, the team's athletes rushed forward one after another to attack. Several shots were unfortunately too high and all crossed the enemy's goal. At 5:20, the Singapore team counterattacked and the center forward, a Malay athlete, shot one point and first opened the game record, and then the ceasefire was announced.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Second Half丨Two to Zero <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>After the two team members rested briefly, they changed positions and then continued the game. The Chinese team kicked off first to challenge, and after the Singapore team's forward defended, they launched an attack. Unexpectedly, the shot was blocked and the center forward used the same method to attack, but it was also blocked. After that, the forwards of the two teams began to circle and fight in the stadium. At this time, the right forward of the team took the opportunity to break through the enemy and pass the ball to the forward, but although Li Huitang had a good opportunity to shoot the ball, he still could not push the ball into the circle. However, the spectators in the stadium were greatly surprised by the Singapore team. After the corner kick, Mr. Li Huitang worked hard, but the opponent's military strength was strong and he could not easily pass the barrier. After the Singapore team counterattacked, Mr. Wenxun rushed forward and shot one point. At that time, the audience cheered and cheered for the victory of the Singapore team. At about 5:55, the Singapore team scored another goal. After that, the two teams did not make much progress, so there were no more points added. At about 6 o'clock, a big battle was declared over, and the Singapore team won the whole victory with a score of three to zero.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Overview of ball skills <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Looking at today's battle, Cao Guicheng was hasty in his actions in the first half and his shots were inaccurate. In the second half, Li Huitang was slow in his movements and his shots were weak. This was the main reason for the defeat. The Singapore team knew that Zhou Xianyan was good at saving low balls, but he often lost his position due to panic when he encountered the team ball, so the shot often took advantage of the opportunity to enter. This was also a great factor in gaining victory in strategy. Although this disastrous defeat cannot be used to judge people, the laxity of the ball technique performance did disappoint the spectators. Failure is the mother of success. I hope the Lehua athletes will not be arrogant or discouraged, and they will train hard. On the one hand, they will recruit talents and cooperate sincerely. If Yao and Ya Jiu, who played in today's game, are also good players in the expedition to Europe and America, and they can be persuaded to travel with them, the strength of the expeditionary force will increase a lot. This expedition is related to the national honor and is not just a matter of Lehua team.</p>

<p>Four to One ... Defeats the United States</p>
<p>丨Result of the Third Day's Competition: France Wins Two More Singles丨</p>
<p>(Paris Telegraph, 27) France, with a score of four to one, defeated its strong rival, the United States, in the 1930 Davis Cup Championship and continued to hold the championship for another year. The good news spread everywhere and the whole country was ecstatic. French President Domergue, who personally led the expedition, also stood up and cheered with the audience, happy and excited, which cannot be described in words. Even the defeated American players approached and congratulated them with their chivalrous spirit. At this moment, as the setting sun sets and the twilight is vast, the three musketeers of the Davis Cup, which shook the world and won glory for the country, declared success and slowly closed the curtain.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Success of the Three Musketeers of France <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>France relied on the four horsemen who dominated the world of tennis for several years. This year, La Assid left the game and lived in seclusion, so the four horsemen became the three musketeers. The so-called three musketeers are Kochland, Bo Rope Latot, and White Ronny. The three musketeers in the final scene of this session have made the most of their skills, and Kochland's three-day winning record is particularly outstanding, and he deserves to be the world's number one. The ambitious American players received the heavy task of unanimous expectation from their motherland. At that time, they were exhausted and could not show anything, so they had to bow down to the rackets of the three musketeers. They only hoped to see you again next year to relieve the pain and shame of four consecutive failures.</p>
<h3 id="e94">The Course of the French and American Championships <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>On the first day of the American and French championships, both sides won a group each, which was originally expected by the audience. The doubles competition was held the next day. According to the recent strength of both sides, the United States was more confident, but in fact France was superior everywhere and finally won, leading with two to one. People already knew that this championship must be saved by France, because the last two singles groups were not illegal opponents for the United States. Sure enough, in the first game today, French Bolo Tala defeated American George Lord with a score of five to seven, six to three, two to six, six to two, and eight to six. Therefore, France's victory was set, and Kochland's victory over American Tierden with a score of three to one can also be regarded as a performance competition and has nothing to do with the overall situation. As a result, France won the championship with a score of four to one and continued to hold it for another year.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Lord Suffers Hard Loss <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The defeat of French Bolo Tala by American Lord was hopeless, but his record that day was exceptionally good, more stable and more skillful than when he competed with Kochland. The performance of French Bolo Tala can be called a model. The best points are splitting and intercepting, which almost made the Americans exhausted. In the fifth set, the French took the lead with a score of six to five, but suddenly there was an error in the subjective opinion and it became six to six. But in the end, the French still won with a score of eight to six. As a result, Bolo Tala won three to two.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Kochland Wins the Old General <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>France has already won the fate of the singles championship after Du Lorat won. The nature of the competition between French Kochland and the old general Tielden is no different from a performance. Kochland was not without fatigue after two days of fierce battles, but his hitting skills were ingenious and he had complete control over others. From the completion of the second set, he showed his skills. The sudden killing was quick and timely, and Tielden became his victim. The American Tielden won the first set with the power of his shooting, but gradually became overwhelmed and it was difficult to preserve his innate skills. As a result, Kochland defeated the old general with a score of four to six, six to three, six to one, and seven to five.</p>

<p>Fang 6:00 AM Zhu Qiqing vs. Xiao Mingzu West Court</p>
<p>▲Ma Jiangong and He Erkun's balls flew all over the court, with both soft and hard shots, capable of both attacking and defending. Gong Zhenyi's shots were unremarkable, but his ability to tirelessly chase down fierce shots was his specialty, making it difficult to defeat him with aggressive tactics. Hence, he has the nickname "Full Court Flyer." Yesterday, when these two met, attack and defense were evenly matched, and in the end, He Erkun could not endure the constant back-and-forth and repeatedly hit the net, resulting in a miserable defeat with a score of 6-4, 8-6. ▲Wang Wuchen of the Fang group, who is known for his ruthlessness on the court, is very close to Hou Shangxiong in private. Yesterday, before going on the court, they wished each other victory with modesty. However, once the match began, they both showed fierce and aggressive faces, using ruthless means of smashing and blocking without holding back. After the match, they laughed and shook hands in consolation with each other. The score was 6-3, 6-3. ▲Fu Shengxin is also formidable. Guo Qida's skills are like a crane among chickens in the Fa group, but the newcomer Fu Shengxin showed no fear and smashed wildly, leaving Guo Qida unable to defend and losing the first game. The spectators were all shocked. However, Guo quickly figured out a strategy, attacking his opponent's weaknesses and maintaining his reputation by winning the subsequent games. Nevertheless, Fu is also a promising talent. The score was 6-2, 6-0.</p>
<p>▲The country bumpkin battles the martial artist Li Yue's precise martial arts skills and the power of his shots were fully displayed yesterday against Liu Junheng, nicknamed "Country Bumpkin." Amidst the fading twilight, Li relentlessly attacked, bewildering the "Country Bumpkin" who could not defend and suffered defeat. The score was 7-5, 6-0.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau previously received a request from the Qinghua District Municipal Committee to add elementary schools in the district. However, due to the lack of school buildings, the municipal committee donated and raised funds, and the municipal treasury allocated funds to build two new school buildings. They have now been completed, one named Yangcun Elementary School and the other named Anbang Elementary School. Principals have been appointed separately to begin enrollment. Additionally, Gaoqiao Zhicheng Substitute Elementary School, due to financial difficulties and inability to maintain operations, requested that the Education Bureau change it to a municipal school. After repeated investigations, the Education Bureau approved that it will be changed to Municipal Zhicheng Elementary School from the 19th year.</p>

They then boarded the original ship to Kobe, where the entire Chinese Boy Scout troop warmly welcomed and cared for them upon arrival. After disembarking, the Japanese Boy Scout Group arranged the order of travel to various places and provided warm hospitality. Therefore, although they have only been in Tokyo for a few days, they have toured and visited famous sites and schools in Kobe, Osaka, Nara, Kyoto, and Yokohama. The overseas Chinese in Japan have provided utmost hospitality to the troop in terms of accommodation and meals. It is now heard that after visiting Tokyo, the entire troop plans to stay temporarily in Nikko before returning to Shanghai. All Boy Scouts are in good health.</p>

<p>▲Housewife (asking a newly hired cook): What are your cooking skills like? Cook: I can cook anything. I used to work for three years at the home of the famous wealthy Mr. Ri. Housewife: Then why did you leave them? Cook: I didn't leave them. They left me. Because the master and mistress both passed away. Housewife: Gah! They both died? What disease did they suffer from? Cook: Extremely severe indigestion. ▲Husband: Dear, didn't you promise me last time you made new clothes that you wouldn't make any more for at least half a year? Wife: That's right. I did say that. But this morning, I found a very cute set of buttons in the drawer. I bought them last year but never used them. They don't match any of my clothes, so I have to make a new outfit. ▲A: Miss Wang is getting married soon. You're very close to her. What gift are you preparing to give her?

<h3 id="e112">Record of the Unprecedented School Equipment Exhibition, Ms. Ye Hua <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Our country's innovative education has been around for 32 years. Various exhibitions have been heard of. However, there has never been a school equipment exhibition because the scope of school equipment is too broad. Everything from children's clothing, food, shelter, and transportation to the school's living environment is school equipment. It is difficult to collect and even more difficult to exhibit. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau, not fearing the trouble and annoyance, has opened an unprecedented school equipment exhibition at Xicheng and Meixi schools during this steaming hot summer season. How can this not be recorded? Therefore, a brief overview is recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Almost thought I was in the Rainbow Temple Lane. The Education Bureau held its first school equipment exhibition preparation meeting on February 19th. It has been more than 120 days since then. Now it is divided into five parts for display. The attendees and their quantities are: 28 schools with 218 pieces of ordinary equipment, 30 schools with 187 pieces of classroom equipment, 43 schools with 1,005 pieces of subject equipment, 24 schools with 279 pieces of entertainment equipment, and 9 schools with 76 pieces of reference items. Each department has unique and ingenious works. However, ordinary equipment is the most fascinating. Beds, chamber pots, tables, chairs, and stools are all available. It is as if selling a complete set of dowry. The spectators almost thought they were in the Rainbow Temple Lane in the world of dowry shops.</p>
<p>▲Bing Song Appreciates the Young Ladies and Wives. The opening ceremony of the exhibition invited He Bingsong, the chief editor of the Commercial Press and professor at Great China University, to give a lecture. He is a historian, and his talk did not deviate from his old profession. What are our country's school equipment? Historically, it has not been valued. Even the saying that teachers sit on cold benches is enough to imagine. Teachers' equipment is so bad, let alone students. When new education first started, only blackboards were set up but there was a lack of chalk. At that time, there was only borrowing from the face powder of young ladies and wives to write. Although teachers and students felt uncomfortable, they were grateful to the young ladies and wives for their unintentional help. Because if the young ladies and wives did not use face powder, such simple teaching equipment would still be difficult to appear.</p>
<p>▲The Teachers Act as Elementary School Students. On the first day, 356 elementary school teachers from the Education Bureau's summer school went to visit together from Xiaodongmen. Upon arrival, they must all sign in to distinguish diligence from laziness. After reading through it once, they unconsciously "felt the heat of the sun, sweat flowing, and their breath drooping and not recovering." So they gathered in the Xicheng auditorium to rest. The benches in the hall were low and small, originally intended for elementary school students. At this point, the teachers acted as elementary school students, sitting in rows, fanning and wiping sweat, laughing and talking. Among them, two or three fat people squatted in the center of the room, resembling Maitreya, feeling very contented. Visitors who saw it were amused.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Dragonflies Fill Hangzhou City, Heaven, Banana <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>In Hangzhou, at 11:40 AM on the 26th, a large group of black-looking dragonflies flew in from the east, circling in the air. Spectators stood on the streets and alleys, looking up with their heads raised. According to the elders, the abundance of dragonflies is a sign of a great harvest year. Because dragonflies do not harm anything to humans, and are good at capturing locusts flying in the air. Therefore, pests that harm rice can also be reduced. It is found that this year's rice production in Zhejiang is indeed excellent. The vast fields of Zhuji have yielded several times higher than in previous years. It is heard that the price of new rice has been fixed at 11 yuan per picul. The people of Zhejiang will have cheap rice to eat.</p>
<p>Not few.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Sea Goose in the Train <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>A few days ago, I went to Jin to visit my relatives. In the train from Beijing to Shanghai, I heard and saw a lot. Bored during the long day, I dipped my brush and recorded it. ▲Old Father Seeking Son An old man with a clear appearance sat in the corner, silent and sighing frequently. Looking at his attitude, he seemed to have something important on his mind. Everyone was surprised. Upon arriving in Suzhou, a gentleman in the same seat went forward and asked him. He said, "I am from Yuyao. I came to Jin to find my son. Three years ago, my son joined the army and was under Lord Hu's command. Recently, I heard that Lord Hu was defeated, and the wounded soldiers were transported back. Therefore, I went to Jin to find him." The gentleman said, "There are many wounded people. Can you find him?" The old man said, "I miss him very much. I don't know if he is safe or not. I am sixty years old and only have this one son." At that time, the old man's tears flowed uncontrollably, and he was extremely sad. Those sitting nearby could not help but wipe away their tears.</p>
<p>▲What is This? Two people wearing Zhongshan suits were talking loudly, as if there was no one else around. At first glance, they were officials. When the ticket inspector arrived, everyone presented their tickets for inspection. Only the two of them did not give their tickets. The ticket inspector asked them to buy tickets. They said sternly, "What is this?" and took out their badges. The ticket inspector thanked them.</p>
<p>▲Sweating Profusely About ten feet away from my seat were four weak women with wavy hair and rosy cheeks. They wore qipao and high-heeled shoes, extremely fashionable. When the train arrived in Wuxi, there was no cool breeze, and the heat was rising. They stuck their heads out of the window but still felt stuffy. The four women did not dare to move slightly, and the sweat poured down like rain. A student from a certain school laughed and said, "Today, I saw the true face of Mount Lu!" The four women glared at him.</p>
<p>▲Great Bad Luck. I like to eat biscuits. Even when it is hot, I can still eat them. What I brought with me that day was a basket of biscuits. When I was eating the biscuits, a child next to me was drooling and then started crying, asking his mother for them. I gave him a handful. His mother was furious and snatched it away, throwing it on the ground. I didn't understand why. The person sitting next to me was also surprised. All children want to eat when they see something. What was the purpose of snatching it away and throwing it on the ground? Was it because it was too little? To avoid suspicion? It's incomprehensible.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Zen Hall Summer Cooling Record, Deng Chunshu <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>I look up and down on the White Cloud Creek, entertaining myself with calligraphy and painting. How could I have just fulfilled Xiang Ping's wish and suddenly encountered Yuan Xiang's sadness? The 20th of the month was the occasion of the sixth elegant gathering of the Mingshe Society. I rushed to Shanghai, borrowing it to dispel my melancholy. However, living away from home is lonely, and the heat seems to scorch. On the evening of the 25th, I invited friends and celebrities to a vegetarian dinner at the Chongfa Zen Hall on Guling Road to relieve the summer heat. Abbot Ju Feng has been the abbot of the local Wujin Temple in our county for many years. Last spring, he came to Shanghai, spreading his Dharma power. The temple rents the residence of the Ye family. The hall and courtyard are grand and deep. There were no Buddhist events that day. Zhuang Jingtian and Yao Jingqiu arrived at six o'clock. Wang Yiting also arrived gracefully. I hadn't seen him for several years, and his appearance was still the same as before. I asked him if he was the same age as Jingqiu. Not only were they from the same hometown, but they were also the same age. I immediately showed the horizontal scroll of the Orchid Pavilion Gathering, which I had painted. The eighteen people in the picture all went to the Purification Ceremony last spring, and each had a seven-character poem inscribed on the right. Yiting sighed and said that it was skillfully drawn. He said that in recent years, there have been few such refined people and refined events in this era. He gladly picked up his brush and inscribed a few words. Sun Yusheng, Yan Ganyuan, Dai Boxing, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Lu Danlin, and Zheng Zhian, Yimei and Xiumei successively arrived. They all deeply praised the temple's secluded, cool, and spacious atmosphere, which is rare in Shanghai. Ganyuan is a major collector of epigraphy in Guanzhong and is also skilled in calligraphy and painting. Yusheng, although nearly seventy years old, is still like the prime of life. Zhuzhuang is deeply involved in Zen principles and likes to travel to mountains and rivers. He has already climbed four of the five sacred mountains. He asked me</p>

<p>(10) (3) Track and Field Stadium Layout</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's performance in various sports, especially track and field, has been the most disappointing. Since the Fifth Far Eastern Games, our country's situation has been deteriorating, and the opportunities to score points have been decreasing. At the Eighth Games held in Shanghai, we scored zero points. In this Games, we were fortunate to get one point, but in fact, it was because Japan's Nambu Chuhei did not participate in the triple jump. Nambu's performance is above Oda's. If he had entered the competition, Situ Guang would have been relegated to fifth place. Therefore, it was not really achieved through genuine ability. A certain person from the Japan Sports Association once told reporters that China's track and field performance can be said to have made very little progress. The Philippines progressed two steps, and Japan progressed four steps. In the future, no matter what, China and the Philippines will not be enemies of Japan. It is found that our country's track and field's lack of vitality and the audience's lack of interest are also major reasons. In sports meets in various places, ball games are always more crowded than track and field events. This is clear evidence. Therefore, how to attract the audience's interest is an issue that should be specially studied and remedied. What is recorded in this article can be used as a model for our countrymen, and people in the Sports Promotion Association should pay special attention to it. The reporter visited the Japanese National Track and Field Athletes Preliminary Selection Conference in Tokyo on May 16th and 17th. The layout of the track and field stadium was no different from the Far Eastern Games. The results of each competition were made very clear to the audience. In the Far Eastern Games, the reporter's job was very important, reporting the competition results at all times. News reporters did not have the trouble of running around for interviews, and the order of the meeting was very orderly. For example, in the 100-meter first group preliminary, the reporter reported the names of the participants and their running positions via radio before the event. A few minutes after the run, the results were reported, as well as the distance between the first and second place. The reporter seats were next to the reporter, so the information was clearer. They reported the news to the newspaper through desk telegraphs. Those without telephones wrote the results on small pieces of paper and sent them by carrier pigeons. In the meeting, printed order books were available, and the audience held a copy in their hands, listening quietly to the reporter's words and recording them one by one in the book. It was a scene of great joy. Tens of thousands of people in the field were actually performing the duties of reporters, so the interest was felt to be doubled. The equipment for the field events was even more thorough. For example, in the high jump and long jump, the reporter reported the names of the participants before the event. After each jump, the results were reported. When the six people selected in the preliminary were chosen, the names were reported again. After the competition, the results of the first to fourth place were reported in detail. Several wooden boards about several feet high were prepared in the field. The boards were black and had large white Arabic numerals written on them. For example, when the high jump reached a height of 1.95 meters, the wooden boards spelled out the numbers 195. It was very clear from a distance. For the discus and shot put, a white powder line was drawn to indicate a certain distance. For example, white lines were drawn for 30 meters, 35 meters, 40 meters, 45 meters, and 50 meters for the discus. Several small national flags were also prepared. When a Chinese athlete threw to a certain point, the Chinese flag was inserted there, fluttering in the wind. The distance of the throw and the distance compared to other countries were clear at a glance. At the Japanese National Preliminary Meeting, there was no distinction between countries, so these small flags were discarded and not used. Only a red small flag was inserted at the world record position to show the meaning of competition and encouragement. Therefore, the order of the field events was orderly. No one except the judges and athletes entered the field. Even photography reporters were severely restricted. Japanese newspapers are very quick to report sports news. The results of competitions before 3:30 PM can be published in the evening paper on the same day. Detailed manuscripts are available from the news agencies by 8:00 PM for news before 7:00 PM. This should also be attributed to the perfect layout of the track and field stadium. The order of our country's track and field stadium is the most chaotic. This has been the case in previous sports meets, and the last National Games in Hangzhou was even worse. The organizers issued judge badges indiscriminately, allowing people to enter the track and field to watch. Because the conference did not have an official report on the competition results, news reporters had no choice but to run around the field to interview. The reporter, Du Tingxiu, did not perform the duties of reporting and repeatedly declared on the radio that he was driving reporters out of the field, publicly insulting reporters, and exceeding the authority of the reporter. Reporters should not enter the field to interview, but the conference should order the reporter to report the results from time to time and maintain the order of the entire field indirectly. Therefore, the responsibility lies entirely with the improper conduct of the conference organizers. The lack of common sense of Du Tingxiu is especially laughable.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been interested in traveling and writing travel poems. I wonder if the two or three volumes of Sheng You Tu Yong have been published. I deeply yearn for them. Yimei and Xiumei are as gentle as good women, and their writing is brilliant. They are promising newcomers to the literary world. Zhian's poems are beautiful and elegant, and his opening lines startled the elders. However, Zhou Mengpo went to Mogan Mountain, and Zhao Banpo and Yan Zairu were ill. Sun Xueni and Tian Jihen said they would come but were hindered by affairs. They all replied in letters expressing their regret. Then, when the lights were brightly lit and the electric fans were blowing, just after entering the seat, the Western God arrived late and asked about Shou Juan. Hu Yishan also came late. The Yibu dishes were mostly named after delicacies, and everyone said they were delicious. The owner of the Reading Painting Building was a connoisseur, and Danlin liked to play with paintings by famous people. Since we had not seen each other for a long time, we talked at length during the banquet, planning to finely print the beauty and wealth of the art world that we had collected. Huahua heard this and rushed over, saying that amidst the ten-zhang red dust, during the hundred-degree photography season, a hall of elegant gatherings was full of celebrities. It was truly a way to spend the summer. Mr. Hu Jifan said that tonight's banquet was no different from the West Garden. Why not try to paint a picture? So I retreated and first drafted this record as the basis for making the picture. (No remuneration)</p>

<p>Chapter 13: Who Plants Good Fortune Unintentionally Gains a Diamond Ring; Only This Fate Inspires a Song of Golden Threads</p>
<p>It turned out that the day the International Garden Fair was extended was also the day the Kindling Fortune lottery tickets were drawn in public. Many people bought a few tickets, as if they had already donated the money to others. Whether they won or not, they no longer paid attention. But there were also many ladies and young women who bought a ticket, harboring great hope. This was like the champagne tickets bought during the horse racing season, and before the drawing, it was as if the first prize was already in their pocket. Moreover, the first, second, and third prizes were all valuable treasures, so many people longed to win. In addition, the officers running the International Garden Fair were elated because the fair had been so successful. On the last day, they added many more amusements. In addition to Chinese and Western fireworks, there was also Western music and Chinese Kunqu opera singing, etc. As a result, the traffic was even busier than the previous three days. On that day, Shi Guanping was particularly excited. At three o'clock in the afternoon, he ran to the editorial office of the Ping Bao newspaper and said, "You should go to Zhang Garden. Today is the last day, and there are many more games and programs. And it is also the day when the Kindling Fortune tickets are drawn there. If you go, I have a carriage here." Everyone said, "It's enough to go once. The second time, it doesn't feel like anything special, just these little games. And going to a place like that always costs money. The food and drink in the fair are much more expensive than outside. You might even run into some familiar ladies and young women who will take advantage of you." Shi Guanping said, "I want to go and see. They gave me two hundred tickets. At first, I thought I wouldn't be able to get rid of them all. Later, you took five and I took ten, and I actually sold quite a few. Now I have less than twenty left. I think there must be some prizes among these two hundred tickets. Maybe not big prizes, but there must be a few small ones. After the lottery is drawn, the Kindling Fortune ticket organization will be finished. After I handle the winning tickets and distribute them, it will be none of my business." At this time, Zuo Shichen had just arrived at the newspaper office. Shi Guanping said to him, "How about it? Today is the public drawing for the Kindling Fortune tickets at Zhang Garden. Don't you have ten tickets too? Why not go and take a look together? Maybe the first prize is in your hands." Zuo Shichen said, "Okay, okay. If my ticket wins the first prize, please give me a call and let me know. I will come to collect the prize. Or please bring me the prize you collected." This was just a joke between the two, thinking that winning a big prize among so many tickets was like finding a needle in a haystack. Who knew that before four-thirty, Shi Guanping actually called from Wei Chun Garden and said to the tea boy, "Please ask Mr. Zuo to come and answer the phone." Zuo Shichen ran to answer it. Shi Guanping said, "Do you have your Kindling Fortune tickets with you?" Zuo Shichen searched all his pockets, but he didn't have them.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Financial and Gold Market Fury and Storm <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>▲The air dominated by extreme disorder, yesterday, the 28th, the gold price reversed the downward trend of the previous weeks. However, the disorder in the market reached its extreme, with sudden and unpredictable changes, and the storm was unusually dangerous. There were sudden advances and retreats. In the morning, there was an accumulation of almost ten taels, and in the afternoon, it actually reached twenty taels. Looking back, it is difficult to speculate, and colleagues have no clue, but follow the control of the air. The foreign exchange rate increased by half a point, but the internal situation was still peaceful. The trading in the market was also diverse, as if in a five-mile fog. Companies such as Yongkang, Yongfeng, Yuancheng, and Yongheng all bought in, while Fuchang, Yuanmao, Yongzhifengyong, etc., had unsettled deliveries. Yongcheng, Changda, Decheng, Jinan, Yuanxing, and Yongyufa Yong, etc., all sold their positions. From the early market, although the large bar was long, the exchange rate did not move people's hearts, so it was good to go high. Afterward, the fluctuations and advances and retreats were about sixty taels. In the afternoon, Xiangyu, Xiezhi, Fengyong, etc., came out and re-entered, while Yuanmao, Yongshen, Changyong, and Yiyu, etc., bought. Yuancheng, Yongyuanxing, Yongyuansheng, Taikangrun, Jinan, etc., tended to sell. At first, it was still flat, but soon after, large households frantically sold, and the price plummeted by more than ten taels, suddenly breaking through 550 taels. The Indian exchange rate was also low, and the market situation turned soft, so large bars or the telegraph did not lead to further upward movements. This aroused people's minds, and the general reason suddenly turned firm, presumably due to the short side's replenishment. For a time, the wind and clouds rose sharply, straight to the high peak, and suddenly broke through sixty taels, with a surge of about twenty taels. The great change in the market is what caused the danger. As of yesterday, due to the large bar on Monday having no telegrams, but the Sunday telegrams were all up by one-quarter, and the silver price increased by three-eighths.</p>
<p>▲The initial opening increased by three taels. The September gold price initially opened at 560 taels, an increase of three taels. The market fluctuated greatly, falling from 63 taels and 5 qian to 56 taels and 2 or 3 qian. The foreign exchange rate changed from tight to short, and Mitsui of Dalian absorbed 1 tael, 2 qian, and 9 fen to 8 fen. First, the October gold rate was reduced to 7 pence ○625, and then it was pulled up by 4 taels to the price when the shilling was announced, which was around 59 taels. At this time, Yuanxingyong, etc., sold, and the British gold rate increased by 1.25, the American gold rate by 25, and the Japanese gold rate was suppressed by 1 point. Later, it suddenly dropped to 54 taels and a half. Afterward, the exchange rates seemed to stabilize, and the gold price soared, actually rising by 8 taels. However, there were four taels of fluctuations from time to time. At 10:45, the increase was counted as 63 taels. A quarter of an hour later, it dropped by 8 taels to 11 o'clock, which was 55 taels. After the addition of various numbers, it suddenly rose by more than 7 taels, and at 11:20, it was 62 taels and a half. After entering, the sellers were still active, and then it was suppressed by 3 or 4 taels. There was a change of 1 or 2 taels, and the market closed at noon at 58 taels and 8 qian. ▲The afternoon market first fell and closed with a big rise. The afternoon market opened at 57 taels and a half, and then rose from 55 taels and 8 qian to 8 taels, 6 qian, and 7 qian. Then retail investors and others bought in. Suddenly, all parties tended to sell, presumably because the exchange rate had a bearish trend. Yuanxingyong, Jinan, Xiangyu, and Yuancheng, etc., competed to sell. After 3 o'clock, it had broken through 50 taels, and the drafts had also increased. Mitsui and others initially entered October, reducing the shilling to 7 pence ○625 to 125, and then sold September, with the Japanese dollar exchange rate at 4.925. Therefore, people's minds were extremely panicked, and those with too many floating positions were killed and lost everything. At 3:20, the exchange rate suddenly turned low, and the industry's thinking turned firm. Xiangyu, Hengxing, and Xieyu, etc., heavily chased in again. The market was in good spirits, and the price suddenly turned upward, soaring by 20 taels, which was a truly shocking and huge wave. However, the drafts were slightly stable. At 4:15, it suddenly jumped to 64 taels and a half. At 4:30, the market closed at 63 taels, which was actually 6 taels higher than the closing price on Saturday. After the market closed, it continued to rise by 4 or 5 taels. However, all the companies were at a loss for words yesterday.</p>
<p>▲The fluctuations were too large, and the accounting was held twice.

<p>The cotton market is tired near and firm far, because the weather in the local port has a tidal phenomenon, and a part of the psychology is optimistic about the rise of American cotton. Therefore, the market atmosphere is more tense, but because the August term has the sound of short squeezes, in order to avoid danger, the income and expenses are increased, especially the certificate money is two taels, and there is a lack of retail buyers, and the bulls have slightly settled, and the market is trending down. The far month is firm due to weather conditions.▲Hanbiao Dafeng sold 3,200 dan. The Hanbiao previous market opened flat in the near month, and the buying sentiment was strong in the far month.

<p>▲Mumbai: Although last week's market price fluctuated with US cotton, it did not rise or fall compared with the previous week. The price of Omar flower is cheap, and the demand is strong. Some fixed-pack Pingger flowers have a high market price, and there is not much business. The local factory demand is temporarily blocked. China and Japan are very quiet, but Japan has slightly traded Omar flowers. The weather in the United Provinces and Bengal is very good. There is too much rain in Omar and the Central Provinces, Khakand, Sind, and Bairo Creek. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: thousand packages)</p>

<p>▲Zhabei: Yesterday, the sources from each road were about 10. The market sales tended to be active. The store's purchase intent was good. The price of North rice fell, and the prices of medium, secondary, and high-quality goods were the same as in the previous market. The thin rice had a firm trend, and the situation was excellent. The new indica rice in the interior had arrived in Shanghai at a price of 15 yuan and 67 jiao, and there were not many transactions, but the market was quite firm. Dongxin rice continued to open at 19 yuan, and the incoming source situation was stable. The price of Bianyuan continued to trend downstream, and the large plate opened high at 18 yuan, which was short by two jiao because the sales were sluggish and the surface was not prosperous.</p>
<p>▲Hunan: The river arrival was less than 10. The departure of each stall was not very smooth and did not have the expansion of the previous day. Changxi and other machine rice were all fixed. The Su Tong white rice and Dongxin rice also did not have much rise and fall. Only the secondary white rice was slightly shortened. The thin rice was still stable. The goods such as Jiaoli opened at 19 yuan and 56 jiao. The arriving source was very rare, so the market was very beautiful. The buying sentiment of Yangjian was flat. The ocean rice was also transferred to sluggishness due to the crazy fall in the bid price. Therefore, the local indica rice turned soft, and the average opening was 16 yuan and 12 jiao. The Tongbian arrival and sales were balanced, and the situation was still stable. The top opening was 18 yuan and 3 jiao. The trends in the north and south markets throughout the day were flat, but the subsequent situation was inevitable. It seems to be soft.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the ocean rice market was sluggish, and the market was sluggish and sluggish. The many households were still continuing to seek relief, but because there were inland purchases, the size of the Jiaohua and the Han gang purchased the Mindang and No. 1 Saigon. Although the number was not large, the sluggish market atmosphere was pulled. In the afternoon, the customer turned pale, which made it impossible to follow the customer gang slightly and turn the aircraft. It is estimated that 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon were sold at a price of 16 yuan and 5 jiao, 200 bags of No. 2 at a price of 13 yuan and 4 jiao, 1,500 bags of large grinding at a high price of 13 yuan and 4 jiao and a half, 12 yuan and 5 jiao and a half, 500 bags of small grinding at a price of 14 yuan and 6 jiao, 800 bags of Mindang at a price of 14 yuan and 6 jiao, 300 bags of small grinding rough at a price of 11 yuan and 4 jiao.

<p>The inverted hanging is too big...Yingkou gangs purchased one after another</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the current month's factory still had fresh ideas, so the market stood again, but the short side was also mostly thrown by the factory, and was unwilling to compensate at a high price, so it showed a mutual ban. The distant period was still flat because the ocean wheat quotation was only one or two horns. Until the afternoon opening, the current month's market was stable due to the settlement between the two sides. However, the distant months showed a steep beauty because the Yingkou and other gangs saw the huge inverted hanging, and continued to purchase for the distant period. Also, the agitation of the terminal wheat in the morning also brought up a lot of views on the ban of large manufacturers. The subsequent situation may not be small for their ban. As a result, the current month was better by 7 cents and a half than the previous week, August was better by 2 cents and 2 cents and a half, September was better by 1 point and a half, October was better by 7 cents and a half, November was better by 1 point, and December was better by 1 point and a half.</p>

<p>Wheat Futures Suddenly Rise Four to Five Points</p>
<p>中關麥廠胃漸活</p>
<p>The Central China Wheat Mills Gradually Become Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market suddenly showed signs of tension after the opening bell, especially for July delivery. Although only three cars were involved, wheat from all over this year generally suffered from a common problem: the delivery coincided with the rainy season. The wheat harvested in various producing areas was generally considered to be of insufficient quality, and due to moisture and lack of proper sun drying, most of it was prone to heat damage, failing to meet the exchange's delivery standards. Therefore, people associated the scarcity of this month's delivery with future contracts, leading to a leap in prices for all months after the opening, rising by six to seven points compared to the previous week's closing price. In the afternoon, the market eased slightly as some long positions were unwound. As a result, August and September futures rose by five points each compared to the previous week, while October to December futures rose by four points each. The current wheat market condition is such that the mills are still active, and the high-quality wheat inventory is not large. Therefore, there is a gradual increase in activity in the Central China region, with prices in various grades increasing by two to three points. Over 8,000 bags of newly harvested and stored Shandong Yao Wan wheat and Nanjing wheat were purchased by Fuxin and Fufeng, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the silk trade in foreign firms in this port remained stable and firm. Yokohama Japanese silk had already shown a price increase. European firms had a strong interest in silk futures, but the silk price was not high. Chinese silk was already in short supply, and yesterday's unsuccessful telegraphic transfers from overseas made transactions difficult. Yesterday, only Xinfu and others brought 30 bales of white filature silk to Shanghai, and Kaili brought 20 bales of yellow filature silk. Prices remained firm, it is said.</p>

<p>Recently, the spot market for British tinplate has been very sluggish. Various out-of-town merchants are actively purchasing, leading to a situation where supply cannot meet demand. The demand from standard brands such as Flying Yellow and Tengda, especially from egg factories and canning factories, is even more enthusiastic, further pushing up prices. The current price for 90-pound boxes is 14 taels, 2 mace, 5 fen per box, and 15 taels, 4 mace, 5 fen for 100-pound boxes. It is said that a total of 800 to 900 boxes have been sold in the market in recent days. It is also said that later batches of purchasers are still very enthusiastic, and there are fears that the market may run out of stock to supply buyers.</p>

<p>Previously, due to repeated telegraphic reports of falling production prices for black pepper, people became greatly alarmed and panicked. Various firms tried to sell their goods as quickly as possible, leading to a massive sell-off in the market. In just three days, the selling price plummeted from 73 taels to 48.5 taels. Such a rapid decline has never been seen before. However, the cost basis for various firms is all above 60 taels. Therefore, the trade association was specially convened to sell through a public offering, with prices set at 59 taels for grade one pepper, 58 taels for the black Dazheng brand, and 57 taels for the secondary brand. Anyone found to be purchasing or selling at a reduced price will be punished, with a term of two months, etc.</p>

<p>Hurricane Hits Shanghai Yesterday</p>

<p>颶風吹入内海傾向我國江浙海面情形曾載昨報兹悉其中心點昨已進抵温州海面本埠大風亦已到臨行將出口之各海輪因得海關警告一律臨時受阻兹將詳情分紀如下</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported on the situation of a hurricane entering the inland sea and heading towards the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in our country. We now know that its center had reached the Wenzhou sea yesterday. A strong wind has also arrived in this port. All ships about to leave the port were temporarily blocked due to customs warnings. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲本埠昨日大風本埠自前日起已有猛烈之東南風天空白雲趨向西北甚速似成風潮氣象入晚又有陣雨風亦轉大昨晨起其勢益烈因之日來酷熱暑氣爲之一消行路頗覺凉爽午後更猛浦中潮水因被風助暴漲數尺惟行駛船隻尙無危險</p>
<p>The Strong Wind in This Port Yesterday: Since the day before yesterday, this port has experienced a strong southeasterly wind. The white clouds in the sky moved towards the northwest very quickly, creating the appearance of a windstorm. There were also showers in the evening, and the wind also increased. From yesterday morning, its intensity increased. As a result, the recent intense heat and summer heat dissipated, and walking felt quite cool. In the afternoon, it became even stronger. The tide in the Huangpu River swelled rapidly by several feet due to the wind, but there was no danger to the ships sailing.</p>
<p>▲颶風進抵海岸前在太平洋上向西北方猛進之新颶颼自吹入内海後繼續向西北迅速進發昨日午後四時據洋涇浜天文台報告颶風之中心區域已過大海吹抵福州與温州間之海岸正在登陸云云惟昨日本埠所到之大風尙在颶風中心點之外者則中心風力之鉅可知且天文台報告力量較上次確爲猛烈大致浙海省海岸已將成災云</p>
<p>Before the Hurricane Reached the Coast: The new hurricane, which was advancing vigorously in a northwest direction in the Pacific Ocean, continued to advance rapidly in a northwest direction after blowing into the inland sea. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the Yangjingbang Observatory reported that the central area of the hurricane had crossed the sea and reached the coast between Fuzhou and Wenzhou, where it was making landfall, etc. However, the strong wind that reached this port yesterday was still outside the center of the hurricane, so the magnitude of the central wind force can be known. Moreover, the observatory reported that the force was indeed more violent than the last time. It is likely that the coast of Zhejiang Province will be devastated.</p>

<p>Customs Fired Warning Cannon: The Customs flag station at Lujiazui in Pudong, based on the observatory's report that the hurricane had reached the coast of Wenzhou, specially hoisted a black warning ball at 4:30 PM yesterday and fired a warning cannon to warn all ships that they must not leave the port to avoid danger.</p>

<p>The Observatory Warned Last Night: The Xujiahui Observatory issued a special warning at 9:00 PM last night, saying that the hurricane had blown to the coast near Wenzhou and was very strong. The direction was northeast-north. Because it wanted to turn and blow here via land, its progress was slow. The sea outside the Wusongkou was turbulent.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo Liners Suspended Service: Taikoo's Xin Beijing and Ningshao's Xin Ningshao were scheduled to depart for Ningbo yesterday. Before 4:00 PM, they were still loading passengers and cargo, selling tickets, and preparing to leave the port. When they heard the customs cannon, they stopped receiving cargo and refunded the tickets that had been sold. They notified the passengers, stating that the voyage was suspended to avoid the storm. About a thousand passengers disembarked and went ashore. The two ships did not depart yesterday.</p>

<p>Ships Avoiding the Storm En Route: The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyan, which was en route to Wenzhou, sent a telegram to Shanghai stating that it was avoiding the storm in Taizhou due to a hurricane on the sea, extending the import period by one day. Jardine Matheson's Guangsheng also anchored to avoid the storm en route outside Wusong yesterday and was unable to reach Shanghai. In addition, the Zhoushan Company's Zhoushan, which was en route from Taizhou to Shanghai, also stopped and anchored en route to avoid the hurricane. Therefore, very few ships arrived yesterday.</p>

<p>Export Ships Postponed: Among the coastal ships that postponed their departure, there are still Sanbei's Wanxiang and China Merchants' Jiahe, both heading to Fuzhou, which were delayed by one day due to the strong wind. Donggang Company's Shengli also did not depart last night and must go to Xiangshan today. Other ships that had already left Shanghai mostly anchored outside the Wusongkou, waiting for the wind to subside before continuing.</p>

<p>The Dahua Steamer Suffered Slight Damage: The Ping An Company's Dahua, which was en route from Taizhou to Shanghai, was damaged yesterday when it was entering the port due to the strong wind and tidal surge. When its hull was anchored in the Huangpu River, it was impacted by the wind and waves, causing damage. At that time, it could not sail, so the goods were unloaded and slightly repaired, and the departure was postponed to today.</p>
<h3 id="e137">王伯羣之談話 <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>

<p>The Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiations are in progress. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Wang had a preliminary meeting with Shigemitsu. In the future, the Ministry of Communications will be responsible for contacting the Japanese side to negotiate the recovery. It is found that there are three Sino-Japanese telecommunications submarine cables: one from Shanghai to Nagasaki, one from Qingdao to Sasebo, and the third is the telecommunications rights of the Northeast South Manchuria Railway, all of which will expire in February. When our newspaper reporter met with Minister of Communications Wang Boqun yesterday, he inquired about this matter and other issues. Minister Wang's statements are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>▲收回電信權王氏謂關於收回電信權交涉如大東大北及中日水綫等均在範圍以内按日本對於電信權絶對屬於國有不許其他任何機關獲有營業權但法國則反是可以自由經營交部方針擬用日本政策最低限度對於其營業權亦須加以相當限制庶政府可以操持監督</p>
<p>Reclaiming Telecommunications Rights: Minister Wang said that negotiations on reclaiming telecommunications rights, such as the Great Eastern, Great Northern, and Sino-Japanese submarine cables, are all within the scope. According to Japan, telecommunications rights are absolutely owned by the state, and no other organization is allowed to obtain operating rights. However, France, on the contrary, can freely operate. The Ministry of Communications plans to use the Japanese policy, and at a minimum, impose considerable restrictions on their operating rights so that the government can maintain control and supervision.</p>
<p>▲三月後進行現時因眞茹大電臺尙未建築工竣加以金潮高漲遽言收回我國吃虧過大太不合算且市上公債種類已多再有發行定感困難故交部現時對日丹各方頗願加以研究討論詳爲接洽至備價收回俟二月後大電臺告成再開始積極進行屆時金價亦可望稍跌</p>
<p>Proceeding After March: Currently, because the construction of the Zhenru Grand Radio Station has not been completed, coupled with the rising gold tide, it would be too disadvantageous and not cost-effective to hastily say that we will reclaim it. Moreover, there are already many types of government bonds on the market, and it will definitely be difficult to issue more. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications is currently very willing to conduct research and discussion with Japan and Denmark to negotiate in detail. As for the preparation for repurchase, we will start actively after the Grand Radio Station is completed after February. At that time, the gold price is also expected to fall slightly.</p>
<p>▲新公司成立王氏又謂關於中美航空問題現合同已簽字資本我百分五十五美飛運公司百分四十五董事我三美二各種用人行政均按資本分配曾開過董事會二次新公司已完全成立但仍沿用中國航空公司名義</p>
<p>Establishment of a New Company: Minister Wang also said that regarding the Sino-American aviation issue, the contract has been signed. Our capital is 55%, and the American Flying Transport Company's is 45%. The board of directors consists of three Chinese and two Americans. All personnel and administration are allocated according to capital. The board of directors has been convened twice, and the new company has been fully established, but it will still use the name of China National Aviation Corporation.</p>
<p>▲我國資本金我國資本金由滬蓉航空處及前中國航空公司資産撥入計共作價爲四百萬元尙短少百五十萬元美方資本已足我國所短少之資金仍由交行擔保美方亦已承認至前滬蓉之技術人員已盡量介紹至新公司服務</p>
<p>Our Capital: Our capital is allocated from the assets of the Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Office and the former China National Aviation Corporation, totaling 4 million yuan. There is still a shortage of 1.5 million yuan. The American capital is sufficient. The funds that our country is short of are still guaranteed by the Bank of Communications, which has also been recognized by the American side. As for the technical personnel of the former Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Office, they have been introduced to the new company as much as possible.</p>
<p>▲平津郵工潮記者詢以處理平津郵務工潮辦法王氏謂當由北平郵務局負責辦理交部以不累及民衆爲主旨近日北來郵件多不貼郵票照章應由受主倍罰但爲體恤計曾令郵局不必施罚僅補足原價爲止云云又王氏近稍感不適暫時養疴滬上並不返京</p>
<p>The Postal Workers' Strike in Peiping (Beijing) and Tientsin (Tianjin): When the reporter asked about the method of handling the postal workers' strike in Peiping (Beijing) and Tientsin (Tianjin), Minister Wang said that the Peiping (Beijing) Postal Bureau should be responsible for handling it. The Ministry of Communications aims not to burden the public. Recently, many letters from the north do not have postage stamps. According to the regulations, the recipient should be fined double the amount. However, out of consideration for the people, the post office has been ordered not to impose fines, but only to make up the original price, etc. Also, Minister Wang has recently felt slightly unwell and is temporarily recuperating in Shanghai and will not return to Beijing.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, our newspaper reporter interviewed Minister of Communications Wang Boqun to inquire about the aftermath of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. According to him, I telegraphed the Ministry of Communications last night (i.e., the 27th) to dispatch Cai Zhiping, Director of the Department of Navigation Affairs, to temporarily maintain the affairs of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. On the one hand, I submitted a request to the National Government to appoint a commissioner to be formally responsible for handling everything. As for the organizational problem of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had previously jointly submitted a proposal to the Central Standing Committee advocating joint government-private operation, with the government allocating some capital as shares, which would make it easier to reorganize. However, Central Committee member Chen Lifu advocated that the government take it back. This case is still pending. It is expected that in the future, after the Central Standing Committee decides on the policy, the fundamental problem of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company will be resolved, and all other matters can be easily solved, etc.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association sent a letter to the Municipal Government and a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, requesting the recovery of roads built beyond the boundaries in West Shanghai by foreigners, and protested to the Municipal Council, requesting immediate return. The letters and telegrams are recorded as follows: ▲Letter to the Municipal Government: Respectfully, on the 15th of this month, the Municipal Council of the Public Concession infringed on our national sovereignty and hindered the Public Security Bureau from performing its duties on the roads built beyond the boundaries in West Shanghai, which is very distressing. The roads built beyond the boundaries by the Municipal Council have no legal basis. It is already wrong to delay the return to your government for management until now. Now, it wants to take further actions in an attempt to seize police power, which is even more intolerable. Director Yuan of the Public Security Bureau maintains police power and is loyal to the country, which is greatly admired. The association believes that in order to achieve a permanent solution, the Municipal Council should be requested to recover the roads built beyond the boundaries, so that all problems can be easily solved. It is reasonable to forward this letter to you, hoping that you will review and implement it.</p>
<p>▲致外交部電南京國民政府外交部王部長鈞鑒竊查上海公共租界工部局越界所築之路全無法律上之根據理應早日交于上海市政府管理至其路上警權歷由市公安局行使乃工部局忽于本月十五日派捕前往滬西越界所築之路上妨害市公安局行使公務殊屬侵犯我國主權曷勝痛心爲特電請鈞部提出收回越界築路之交涉以達一勞永逸之目的不勝企望之至上海租界納稅華人會叩宥印</p>
<p>▲Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: To Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government in Nanjing, greetings. It is found that the roads built beyond the boundaries by the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council have no legal basis at all. They should have been handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Government for management long ago. The police power on the roads has always been exercised by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. However, the Municipal Council suddenly sent police to the roads built beyond the boundaries in West Shanghai on the 15th of this month, hindering the Municipal Public Security Bureau from performing its duties, which is a great infringement on our national sovereignty and is very distressing. Therefore, a special telegram is sent to request your ministry to raise the issue of recovering the roads built beyond the boundaries in order to achieve a permanent solution. I am extremely hopeful. Shanghai Concession Taxpayers Association bows and apologizes.</p>

<p>▲Letter to the Municipal Council: The association also sent a letter to Mr. Edwards, Director General of the Municipal Council, saying: Respectfully, the construction of roads beyond the boundaries is an action of your bureau that infringes on our national sovereignty and has no legal basis. The tragic incident of May 30, 1925, was also caused by the construction of roads beyond the boundaries. Since the construction of the roads has no legal basis, there is no room for exercising police power on the roads. According to the law, the construction of roads beyond the boundaries must be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the police power on the roads should be exercised by the Public Security Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Therefore, the police power on the roads built beyond the boundaries in West Shanghai has always been exercised by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Unexpectedly, your bureau suddenly sent police on the 15th to infringe on the police power of the Municipal Public Security Bureau on the roads in West Shanghai, which almost led to a major unfortunate event. This association is very regretful and cannot remain silent. A corresponding letter is sent to you, hoping that you will investigate and immediately correct this illegal action to avoid major disputes, and promptly return the roads built beyond the boundaries to the Shanghai Municipal Government to show respect for our national sovereignty and to demonstrate the sincerity of cooperation.</p>

According to reports, the Shanghai Chinese Telephone Company Shareholders Meeting has resolved to sell to the International Telephone and Telegraph Company. Although our embassy has not received an official notice regarding the meeting, according to newspaper reports, your association's protest should be submitted to the meeting. According to the Company Law, with the consent of the majority of the company's shareholders, it has the right to sell its property. If the majority of shareholders oppose the sale, it cannot take effect. Your association is a user of the company, and it is surprising that it cannot exercise its rights at its shareholders meeting.

<h3 id="e142">Methods for Paying Late Grain Tax Fines <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Report from the County Finance Bureau</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Finance Bureau issued a public notice yesterday stating that on January 25th of this year, it received Instruction No. 161 from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, which stated that the Department had requested to reinstate the previous practice of imposing a 10% late payment fine on overdue grain taxes after two months from the start of collection, as was the case before the fifth year of the Republic (1916). The Provincial Government Committee had approved this matter at its 215th meeting and should be followed accordingly. In addition to issuing separate orders, the original request and concise rules should be copied and the bureau ordered to comply, post a public notice, and implement the rules starting from the grain tax collection of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), and report back for verification without fail. The lower bureau has received this instruction and, considering that the opening date for collecting the grain tax of the 19th year and the amount of late payment surcharges have already been announced, it is deemed appropriate to copy the concise rules again for public knowledge. It is hoped that all citizens of the county will pay at the counter within the two-month deadline to avoid being summoned for additional fines. This is hereby announced.</p>
<p>▲Concise Rules for Late Payment Fines: (1) All counties collecting grain tax and reed tax should follow the established practice before the fifth year of the Republic (1916), with a two-month deadline from the start of collection. A 10% late payment fine will be imposed for payments exceeding this deadline. (2) The late payment surcharge will be implemented after the two-month deadline from the start of the grain tax collection of the 19th year (1930). No extensions will be granted under any pretext. (3) The late payment fine will only apply to the regular provincial and county taxes. No surcharges will be imposed on any additional taxes collected concurrently. (4) Two months after the start of collection, each county should clearly demarcate the amounts collected for grain tax and reed tax and submit a report for auditing purposes. (5) All fines collected should be remitted to the province for use, as was the case before the fifth year of the Republic (1916). No county is allowed to retain any portion of the fines. (6) The old system of charging 20% for the first two months should be immediately abolished. (7) If payment is still not made one month after the penalty period, collection will be enforced.</p>

<p>Investigating the Contents of the Municipal Council's Rice Purchase</p>
<p>And Preventing Rice Merchants from Hoarding and Profiteering</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Issue Special Committee organized by the Shanghai Citizens' United Association held its first meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock. The special committee members present were Yu Hualong, Zhang Yichen, Qiu Jialiang, Wu Liangsheng, Zhang Xianfang, Yu Yangsheng, Chen Jicheng, Chen Weiwen, Jiang Xinzhao, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Hengbai, Yu Zhongcheng, and over ten other people. Committee Member Zhang Yichen was elected as chairman. After the formalities, the chairman reported that the Association had specially organized this special committee to study the issue of rice and grain supply, paying attention to people's livelihood and remedying the food shortage. The committee members bear a heavy responsibility, and they should strive for rigorous and rapid progress in their approach to avoid disappointing the citizens. After the report, the committee discussed the following agenda items: (1) Committee Member Jiang Xinzhao submitted a draft of eight articles for the committee's organizational regulations for public decision. The resolution was to adopt the draft proposed by Committee Member Jiang Xinzhao after reading and slightly revising each article. (2) The chairman proposed the election of standing committee members and a secretary. Zhang Yichen, Yu Hualong, Hu Fengxiang, Zhang Xianfang, and Yu Yangsheng were immediately elected as standing committee members, and Committee Member Jiang Xinzhao was elected as secretary. (3) Committee Member Qiu Jia proposed that although rice prices have recently fallen, most rice shops do not publicly display detailed daily rice prices, and there are instances of mixing inferior rice to reduce the quantity of rice sold. He proposed that the authorities be requested to issue an order requiring all rice shops to strictly comply. The resolution was to request the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to issue an order requiring all rice merchants to display rice and grain prices daily and strictly prohibit the mixing of inferior rice, increasing the price through secret channels, or reducing the quantity of rice sold to uphold the law and reassure the people. (4) Committee Member Jiang Xinzhao proposed that the Municipal Council has agreed to allocate funds to purchase cheap rice to regulate rice prices. As a legal body representing the citizens in the area, should the Association send representatives to investigate the truth and assist in the process? The resolution was to appoint Committee Members Hu Fengxiang and Yu Yangsheng to first consult with Chinese Director Tan Qiqing to inquire about the truth and then verify it. (5) Jiang Xinzhao proposed that many foreign rice shipments have recently arrived, but because the Shanghai rice market has already fallen, many rice merchants are unwilling to sell and are storing the goods in warehouses and borrowing cash from banks and money houses to hoard and wait for an opportunity. This has a significant impact on rice prices and people's livelihoods. Should this be investigated and dealt with? The resolution was to assign the investigation to committee members separately and submit the evidence to the authorities for investigation and handling as soon as reliable evidence is obtained. (6) The meeting decided that the standing committee would meet every Friday at 3:00 PM, and standing committee members would be on duty at the meeting every day. (7) The committee requested that all members investigate and develop plans at any time. The meeting adjourned at 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>August 1st</p>
<p>Wen, the director of the National Anti-Smuggling Bureau, had already drafted a proposal for the National Anti-Smuggling Conference and submitted it to Finance Minister Song for approval. It is now learned that the conference is scheduled to be held on August 1st at the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of the Su-Wu Region on Anlan Road in Shanghai. The main points of the conference are to reorganize salt tax revenue and rectify the affairs of the national anti-smuggling sub-bureaus. The director of the Su-Wu Region Anti-Smuggling Bureau, Feng Wenyu, is actively preparing proposals and planning the implementation.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Record of the Joint Meeting of Surveillance Team Leaders of the Shanghai North Defense Corps <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai North District Defense Corps held a joint meeting of surveillance team leaders at 3 PM yesterday. All members were present. Corps Commander Wang presided, and Wu Fuchu served as recorder. After the usual formalities, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and declared that since the establishment of the Corps in the 13th year of the Republic (1924) until its reorganization this year, it had been divided into twelve teams with sufficient firearms. However, due to several wars and misunderstandings, the firearms had been confiscated repeatedly, and even when returned, the number was insufficient, resulting in a shortage of weapons and ammunition, which in turn reduced the number of voluntary members. This time, the Corps was ordered to reorganize according to the new regulations, with each team limited to 108 members. The corps has been reorganized into nine teams. Except for the ninth team, which is a reserve team, the other eight teams have been reorganized, and the number of members has been replenished according to the order. Currently, the Corps plans to pay attention to local defense because the war in the front is not yet over. Moreover, the defense corps is a popular self-defense organization that supplements the local police. However, according to the reports from each team, the number of firearms only accounts for half of the number of members. The strength is still insufficient, and it is still a matter of name only. The overall planning requires tens of thousands of dollars. The leaders and directors of various industries in Zhabei have made donations, but where it is insufficient, Committee Member Yu and Director Wang are requested to consult with public-spirited people in Shanghai to find ways to raise funds to achieve a large-scale arrangement to maintain local security. Therefore, today's meeting is convened to request that each surveillance team leader submit a register of directors to the Corps so that a meeting can be scheduled to raise funds. The meeting discussed several items related to the progress of team affairs and adjourned at 6 PM.</p>

<p>Sun Liangbi, the director of the Bureau for Clearing Official Property of Shangbao Sand Fields, sent a letter to the Shanghai County Government yesterday, stating that he had received an instruction from the Jiangsu Provincial Bureau of Sand Field Official Property, which stated that government agencies often requisition land without following agreed-upon procedures and requisition private land without following the Land Requisition Ordinance, leading to disputes. The National Government has now approved that government agencies should pay for official land requisitioned according to its value. The county government has received the letter and has ordered its subordinates to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Guangli Steamer Aground and Salvaged <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>▲The Guangli Steamer of China Merchants Bureau Aground at Grand Island. The Guangli steamer, originally a sea vessel, was transferred to the Yangtze River for use. It departed from Hankou on the 26th of this month and headed east towards Nanjing. Unexpectedly, it ran aground on the Yangtze River near Grand Island (approximately near Jiujiang). At that time, the tide was low, and the water depth in the river was only 11 feet. The Guangli steamer's draft was at least 14 feet, causing the hull to run aground on the Grand Island river surface, and the hull was stuck in the shallow sand and mud, making it impossible to move.</p>
<p>▲Request for Assistance by Telegram to Shanghai. The captain realized that reversing the engine could not move the hull and knew that it could not be rescued without towing. He sent a radio message to Shanghai requesting the Shanghai General Bureau to quickly send a ship with a draft of 11 feet to rescue. The message arrived in Shanghai on a Sunday. The head of the shipping department, upon receiving the report, immediately telegraphed Hankou, ordering the Jiangyu steamer, which had a shallower draft, to tow three barges to Grand Island for rescue.</p>
<p>▲Shallow Water Prevents Towing. The Jiangyu and three barges arrived at the grounding site to carry out the towing work, but the river water was too shallow, and the Guangli steamer's hull had already sunk into the shallow mud, making it impossible to tow it out for a while.</p>
<p>▲Appeal for Help from the Chief Mate. The Guangli has been aground for more than two days. The Jiangyu could not tow it out, and the Guangli steamer's chief mate has taken the dispatched rescue boat to Hankou to discuss rescue measures with the Hankou branch in order to return to tow the steamer.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Remarks by Han Yougang, Representative to the International Silk Conference, After Returning to China <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>The International Silk Conference was held in New York, USA, last autumn. China sent four representatives to attend. In addition to representatives Xue, Wang, and Li, who returned to China in succession last year, representative Han Yougang stayed in the United States for several months due to personal matters and was later dispatched by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Belgium to participate in the International Exposition. He returned to China via Siberia yesterday. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Han to discuss the conference. (Reporter) Mr. Han, could you tell us about the detailed situation of the International Silk Conference? (Han) The situation of the Silk Conference has been published in the newspapers by the representatives who returned to China last year, and my views are similar, so there is no need to repeat them. However, I hope that Chinese people will continue to improve silkworm breeding and silk reeling based on scientific methods. The future of silk is promising. (Reporter) You were dispatched by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to Belgium to participate in the Exposition. Could you tell us about the situation of the Exposition? (Han) After the Silk Conference last year, I wanted to investigate the government and industry and commerce in the United States, so I was unable to return to China with the other representatives. At the end of February of this year, I received an order from the Ministry to participate in the Exposition in Belgium. I left the United States in April and transferred from England to Belgium. First, I went to the north of Belgium. Because of domestic ethnic relations, the centennial exposition could not be held in one place. The north was in Antwerp, which is the coast of Belgium. The exposition there was dedicated to the products and navigation of the colonies of various countries.</p>
<p>The establishment had not been completed at that time, and the products and wax figures of men and women from the three northeastern provinces of China were displayed inside as colonial products and figures. The map on the wall depicted Japan and China in the same color. I witnessed this abominable situation. In addition to reporting everything to the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, I also asked the Chinese ambassador to Belgium to fight for it. After repeated negotiations, the Japanese realized that they were wrong and moved all the items away. The exposition in the south was in Liège, the most developed industrial area in Belgium. The population is about 160,000. The venue is next to the Meuse River, about 200 acres in size. The area of our exhibition hall is only 300 square feet, which is very small. Furthermore, because the domestic industry and commerce were not willing to actively participate, the results were very unsatisfactory. If the items purchased and transported by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had not been added, the situation would have been even more unbearable. (Reporter) You returned from Siberia this time, passing through Russia. Were you delayed? Could you tell us what you witnessed? (Han) When the train we were on entered Russian territory from Berlin via Poland, we had to change trains in Moscow for about eight hours. I spent five hours wandering the streets of the city. I saw hungry people everywhere, gathering in front of bakeries to receive black bread. As for the shops, nine out of ten were empty, and there was no commerce to speak of. The people walking on the road were all hungry and terrified. The train journey took eight days, and beggars were everywhere, and the people suffered unspeakably. And there are still scum among our Chinese youth who advocate communism, whose flesh is not enough to eat. (Reporter) You have temporarily left the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. Are you no longer serving in politics? (Han) I have realized deeply after returning from abroad this time. Although the trip lasted only eleven months and passed through only a dozen countries, the feelings were profound. I have decided to break away from everything and serve the country. I know that a country's standing on the earth requires a unified regime and a stable center to survive and prosper. I hope that all compatriots will rise up and work together to prevent our Chinese nation from becoming slaves in an irredeemable situation. At this point, Mr. Han sighed, and the reporter bid farewell and left.</p>

<p>Silver Braids Are Hard to Obtain</p>
<p>The Chinese Corps of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps was initiated by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, starting with the Shanghai North Chinese Merchants' Gymnastics Association. Since joining the volunteer corps of the concession, they have consistently encouraged each other to serve with dedication and have always taken the lead in times of danger, striving for excellence. Therefore, they have been able to achieve good results over the years and are admired by the teams of various countries. It is heard that the corps headquarters presents a long-service medal to first-class qualified members who have served for twelve years. As previously reported, a silver braid is added to the top of the long-service medal for those who have served for seventeen years, and two silver braids are added for those who have served for twenty-two years to mark their many years of service and increase the honor of long service. However, this silver braid is not easy to obtain. It is not only based on years of service but also requires excellence in various courses, proficiency, and self-discipline over the years to achieve this. Therefore, looking around the entire corps, only ten people have double silver braids, two of whom are Chinese. Only Xu Tonghao and Hu Yunqiu have single silver braids. There are only twelve people in the entire corps, and five of them are Chinese, namely Song Yunqi, Liu Jinghe, Chong Dihua, Sun Zigao, and Chen Wenlong.</p>

<p>A Total of Thirty-Six People</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization established the Diligent Labor Institution for Vagrants. Since it began accepting vagrants in April of last year and reported its establishment to the Bureau of Social Affairs on June 11th, it has been one year since then. The institution has accepted more than 500 vagrants in succession. According to Article 7 of the institution's charter, vagrants who have served a full year and have shown evidence of repentance may be reported for release. The director of the institution, Wu Tang, will verify the families, origins, and the amount of work bonuses due to the vagrants who have served their terms and report them to the Bureau of Social Affairs and the Public Security Bureau for approval before releasing them. The release ceremony was held yesterday to show solemnity. Representatives from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Rao Qiangsheng, and the Public Security Bureau, Section Chief Huang of the Second Section, the section chief of the Third Sub-Bureau of the Sixth District, and the chairman of the institution's board of directors, Wang Yiting, the standing director, Qin Yanqi, and Yang Fuyuan, as well as dozens of guests from all walks of life, attended the ceremony. The meeting began at 10:00 AM. Director Wu reported on the progress of the past year and the conduct and work of the vagrants who were released after serving their terms. Representatives from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Rao, the Public Security Bureau, Huang, and the chairman of the board of directors, Wang Yiting, then gave speeches, generally stating that the reason why people become vagrants is due to their excessive dependence and lack of self-reliance, and that the way to be a good person should focus on the goodness of the heart. The released vagrants then gave a speech of thanks, which was quite pertinent and moved the audience. It is heard that the first batch of released vagrants totaled thirty-six people, and the total amount of work bonuses issued was more than 440 yuan. After the meeting, they took photos and thanked everyone before leaving.</p>

<p>The Wusong Eighth District Party Department sent a letter to Yuan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, yesterday, stating that Wusong is adjacent to Shanghai and is related to the overall image of the city. The most important thing for the local area is police administration. The quality of the personnel of the police administration should be a matter of concern to the general public. Without discussing the quality of the police administration since District Chief Yang Maorong took office, his words and actions are absurd, his behavior is perverse, and he is selfish and does not conform to public opinion. In particular, a photo of him and a woman who jumped into the sea taken shoulder to shoulder has been circulating in society, causing shock and consternation. The newspapers have been reporting on it, and there is no way to hide it. If he is not punished, how can the officialdom be rectified? Moreover, the district chief is a model for the police personnel in the entire district, and he has openly taken this unexpected action. Speaking leniently, it can be said that it is not a matter of great importance, but in terms of personality, even small matters should be taken care of. If he is not investigated, I am afraid that the superiors will follow the example, and the future of the police administration will be unimaginable. Our department is in the same district and has closer ears and eyes. We have silently observed public sentiment and cannot bear to remain silent. Therefore, we have prepared a letter to inform you and dare to ask you to quickly remove him from his post and investigate him as a warning to others and to purify the officialdom.</p>
<p>More than ten public organizations, including the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, the Farmers' Association, the Seamen's Union, the Wusong Branch, the Lumber Merchants' Guild, and the Customs Brokers' Guild, sent a letter to Zhang, the Mayor of Shanghai, and Yuan, the Director of the Public Security Bureau, stating that since Yang Maorong, the district chief of the Seventh District of Public Security, took office, his handling of official affairs has been perverse. In the case of the woman who jumped into the sea, he openly took a photo with her. He did not avoid suspicion, and the district chief's personality has been lost, causing public opinion to be in an uproar. The Chamber of Commerce and other organizations are concerned about the future of the police administration and believe that the local morality is at stake and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we are informing you of the situation and requesting you to review and approve it and to quickly punish him as a warning to others and to maintain the police administration.</p>

<p>The China National Products United Department Store held its second executive committee meeting of manufacturers' representatives yesterday. Wang Hanqiang was elected chairman to report on the minutes of the previous meeting and today's meeting order. Then, Zhang Zilian, the manager of the department store, reported on the progress of handling various affairs and said that he felt that his personal strength was insufficient and hoped that the committee members would urge him from time to time. Then, Sun Jiren, the director of the department store's affairs section, Cao Zhigong, the director of the publicity section, and Cheng Xiqing, the committee member of the disciplinary section, reported on the work situation. Then, the committee discussed the following issues: (1) Committee Member Zhang Xianda sent a letter requesting his resignation. The resolution was to retain him. (2) How should the electricity fees for electric lights, advertising lights, and electric fans installed by the manufacturers be charged? The resolution was to first issue the electricity company's fee schedule. For those beyond 400 branches of light, the detailed method of installing a meter and counting will be discussed at the next meeting. (3) Please Mr. Cao Zhigong to also serve as the secretary of this committee. The resolution was approved. The meeting adjourned. In addition, since the department store purchased goods and gave away amusement tickets to the amusement park, business has become even more developed.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Old Farmer Dies Tragically in Houjiazhai <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Sun Laowu's Death Is Extremely Tragic</p>
<p>The Nephew Who Fled Is Suspected of Killing His Uncle</p>
<p>A murder case occurred in Houjiazhai, near Jiangwan, yesterday morning. The deceased, Sun Junbao, was from Tongzhou and was 50 years old. His death was extremely tragic. He was forcibly chopped and stabbed with a hoe-like sharp blade and scissors. The murderer fled after the incident. Only one suspected accomplice was arrested. According to the deceased's nephew, his cousin is strongly suspected of killing his uncle. If so, it would be another major case of patricide.</p>
<p>▲The Smell of Blood in the Thatched Hut. The deceased, Sun Junbao, also known as Lao Wu, lived in a thatched hut behind Houjiazhai. He lived alone because he was old and weak and unable to work. He planted vegetables behind the house to make a living. At around 5 AM yesterday morning, a carpenter named Jiang went to knock on the door. After a long time, there was no response. He then pushed the door open and suddenly smelled a strong smell of blood. He was shocked and, upon closer inspection, saw Sun Laowu lying stiff on the ground, covered in blood. He was extremely frightened and ran back to report to the police. The patrol leader of the Qiaojiaqiao Police Station in the Fifth District of the Public Security Bureau went to the thatched hut to investigate and saw blood flowing around the deceased like a river, all red. A small half of his head had been chopped off, his cheeks were flattened, and his teeth were visible. There were huge wounds on his left ribs, chest, and back. The fingers of his left hand had been chopped off with a knife. His body was lying on the ground, struggling before death. The murder weapon seemed to be a hoe-like tool.</p>
<p>▲No Children Under His Knee, Taking His Nephew as a Son. The reason for Sun Laowu's murder is quite complicated. According to his nephew, Sun Fusheng, his cousin Sun Liansheng is strongly suspected of killing his uncle. The deceased was half a century old and lost his wife ten years ago. He had no children under his knee. Three years ago, he adopted Sun Zulilai, the fourth son of his third brother Sun Xuewen, as his heir. Zulilai was young and not used to living with Sun Laowu. Before long, he returned to Tongzhou and severed the relationship between adoptive father and son. Sun Laowu then adopted Liansheng, Zulilai's brother, as his son. Liansheng is now 26 years old and married with children. When he was adopted by Sun Laowu, his wife also came with him.</p>
<p>▲The Adopted Son Is Unruly and Sent Back to His Hometown. Sun Liansheng has always been unruly. Last year, he came to Shanghai with his wife and lived with Sun Laowu in Houjiazhai. Because he had no job, Sun bought a rickshaw and ordered him to pull it to make a living. Sun Liansheng was lazy and fond of gambling. He spent all the money he earned and associated with bad friends, neglecting his wife and children. Sun Laowu was even more unable to get support from him and was very angry. A month ago, he decided to send Sun Liansheng and his wife back to their hometown and sever the relationship between adoptive father and son. Who knew that Sun Liansheng would secretly return to Shanghai not long after returning to Tongzhou, about half a month ago.</p>
<p>▲Stealing Money and Selling the Rickshaw Angers the Old Man. After Sun Liansheng returned to Shanghai, he went to his uncle Sun Laowu again. At first, Sun Laowu did not give him a good face. Because he was disturbed, he reluctantly allowed him to stay. Who knew that his nature was hard to change and he eventually made friends with bandits. He stole Sun Laowu's savings and, not satisfied, stole the rickshaw and sold it privately. When the matter was revealed, Sun Laowu paid money to redeem it and severely reprimanded Liansheng. Liansheng's six or seven bandit friends harbored ill intentions towards Sun Laowu and made threatening remarks.</p>
<p>▲Complaining to His Nephew, He Died the Next Day. Sun Fusheng, Sun Laowu's eldest nephew, works as a driver at Huifeng Motors at No. 136 Laotaiping Lane, Waitan, Nanshi. Two days ago, Sun Laowu went to visit him. After meeting, he said to Sun, "Liansheng is becoming increasingly degenerate. His six or seven friends all harbor ill intentions towards me. I am afraid for my life." Sun Fusheng comforted his uncle with kind words. Who knew that Sun Laowu would be murdered the next day, which made him believe that his nephew Sun Liansheng was the main culprit in this case, motivated by money.</p>
<p>▲Seeking Help from Neighbors, an Accomplice Is Arrested. According to the deceased's neighbors, Sun had been quite distraught for several days before his death and often sought help from his neighbors, saying, "I am old and afraid of being harmed. Please watch over me day and night." The neighbors were surprised by his words and often privately discussed his change in attitude. After the incident, Sun Liansheng disappeared. The police arrested Ji Shuangquan, a rickshaw puller suspected of being an accomplice, for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e156">A Large Fire in Broad Daylight at the End of Linping Road <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Houses Destroyed</p>
<p>An Eighty-Year-Old Man Burned</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:50 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the shacks and bungalows at the end of Linping Road, south of Hujia Muqiao Road, and near Taiping Bridge in northern Shanghai. Approximately thirty houses were destroyed, and an eighty-year-old man from Gaoyou named Wu Wanxing was severely burned. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ The Fire Scene: The fireground was roughly square-shaped. The shacks and bungalows that were engulfed were surrounded by tiled houses and multi-story buildings. The affected area was accessed via Xiang'an Lane, which was extremely narrow. Going north from Xiang'an Lane was Hujia Muqiao Road, beyond the bridge was Miaodong Road. Linping Road was opposite Miaodong Road, separated by a small river. Water for extinguishing the fire was drawn from this river, as the area had no running water or artesian wells, and residents relied on the river for drinking water. The number of houses damaged, from east to west, was as follows: approximately ten shacks, eleven rooms of the Sanxinli building (house numbers 7 to 17, with 16 and 17 being partially destroyed), six and a half bungalows from 6 to 12 Xiang'an Lane (except for 12, which was half-destroyed, the rest suffered significant damage), and three and a half bungalows of Yongxiang Lane near Taiping Bridge Road (house numbers 30 to 32). The fireground was surrounded by houses, resulting in few exits. The only one was Xiang'an Lane which connects to Hujia Muqiao Road shaped like a bottleneck.  Therefore, after the fire started, escaping was difficult, and the fire brigade struggled to extinguish the flames. Furthermore, due to the lack of nearby water mains, the hoses had to be extended a considerable distance into the river. Fortunately, yesterday's high tide and rapid current helped maintain water pressure, otherwise even more houses would have been destroyed.</p>
<p>▲ Cause of the Fire: After the fire started, the various fire brigades in Zhabei rushed to the scene and tried their best to extinguish the flames. However, due to the narrow space, crowds, and difficulty in drawing water, they initially struggled. It was not until the shacks were completely burned down that the fire gradually subsided. By the time the fire was extinguished, it was already late. All that was left on the fireground were piles of charred wood and broken tiles.  When the firefighters were working, police officers from the Linping Road Police Station of the Fifth District, Third Precinct were on the scene to maintain order. The suspected cause of the fire was that the couple Wu Daguozi, from Yancheng, stated under questioning that the fire was started by their five-year-old daughter, Chundi, who was cooking lilies and caused a fire. The couple was away at work and did not take care of the house. After the fire started, their daughter, Chundi, panicked and ran away and is still missing. The severely burned elderly man, Wu Wanxing from Gaoyou, lived in a shack in Sanxinli, Hujia Muqiao Road. Due to his old age and frailty, he suffered severe burns. Afterwards, he was taken by police car to Tongren Hospital for treatment, his condition is precarious.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Detective Arrests Xia Wenlin <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Three Robberies at Tongan Factory</p>
<p>Arrested After Long Surveillance on Binlang Road</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Detective Team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, together with Chinese and Western detectives from the Putuo Road Police Station, successfully cracked the case of the robbery at the Tongan Fabric Factory near the New Pier in Nanshi on the 23rd of this month, during which a firearm was seized from the patrol officer guarding the First District Headquarters. The main perpetrator, Xia Wenlin, has been apprehended. The details of the investigation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Three Robberies, Binding of Police, and Seizing of Firearms: On the 12th of the previous month at 4:00 PM, the Tongan Fabric Factory near the New Pier in Nanshi was suddenly robbed by four thieves, who made off with over three thousand dollars in cash. Incredibly, twenty-seven days later, on the 28th of the previous month, the factory was robbed again, this time of over one hundred dollars. Finally, on the 23rd of this month, the thieves came for the third time. Although the loss was only ten dollars in cash and a few dimes, the patrol officer stationed there was bound and had his pistol stolen.</p>
<p>▲ Police Bureau Orders Intensified Investigation: To avoid the thieves becoming more emboldened after the incident, the case was not reported in the newspapers. Yuan Liang, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, took the matter very seriously and immediately ordered his subordinates to solve the case within a certain timeframe. After receiving this order, Lu Ying, the Captain of the Detective Team, secretly instructed his officers to intensify the investigation.</p>
<p>▲ Main Culprit Xia Wenlin: Two days later, detective team members Qi Haitian, Shan Bin, Fu Kezhong, Xu Rong, Miao Jinhai, etc., received a tip that the mastermind behind the robberies was Xia Wenlin, a native of Anhui who had dealings with the factory. Xia now owns a small weaving factory named Xia Wenji on Binlang Road in the International Settlement. All the goods produced are sold to Tongan, so Xia is fully aware of the prices Tongan pays its customers every day. It was reported that the four thieves who went there the first time (June 12th) were sent by Xia, so they were asked to arrest him as soon as possible.</p>
<p>▲ Detectives Lay in Wait for Three Days and Two Nights: At the same time, Shen Chongli, a Chinese detective from the Gordon Road Police Station, received a tip that Xia was also behind the theft from the home of Wang Zhenshou, a former commander in Hankou, several months ago on Jing'an Temple Road, where over three thousand dollars were stolen. Therefore, detectives from both sides disguised themselves and laid in wait at the location for three days and two nights. Finally, at 7:30 AM yesterday, Xia was apprehended inside a "tiger stove" at 340 Binlang Road.</p>
<p>▲ Temporarily Detained at the Police Station, Awaiting Extradition: After being apprehended, Xia was transferred to the Xinzha Police Station for temporary detention. After a thorough questioning by the police chief, he was ordered to be returned to custody. It is reported that Captain Lu has already reported the details of the case to Director Yuan, and plans to prepare a letter within the next few days to request extradition for trial.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Municipal Public Security Bureau Inspector Ling Runxiang Assassinated <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Shot and Killed in an Alley</p>
<p>Cause Still Unknown</p>
<p>At approximately 11:15 PM last night, an assassination occurred at the entrance of Dexing Lane on North Jiangxi Road in Hongkou. The victim was Ling Runxiang, an incumbent inspector at the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Inspectorate. Ling had finished work and returned home around 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Around 11:00 PM, he left his concubine's residence in Dexing Lane and was assassinated by an enemy at the entrance of the alley, suffering a fatal gunshot wound to the head. The assailant escaped without a trace. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Former Chinese Detective at the Police Station: Ling Runxiang, a native of Panyu, Guangdong, was 36 years old. He lived in Taihua Lane on North Jiangxi Road and had a concubine residing at 634 Dexing Lane. Three years ago, Ling was a Chinese detective at the Hongkou Police Station. After the May 30th Incident, he left his position as a detective. In 1928, when Dai Shifu was the Director of the Public Security Bureau, Ling joined the Bureau as an investigator. Last year, he transferred to the Inspectorate and was promoted to inspector. He was known for his resolute manner and was highly regarded by Inspector He.</p>
<p>▲ Assailant Escaped the Scene: Last night, Ling had dinner at his concubine's residence in Dexing Lane. Around 11:00 PM, he announced that he was going out. His concubine accompanied him to the entrance of the alley, where he was suddenly attacked. According to eyewitnesses, Ling Runxiang was chatting happily with his concubine just minutes before the attack and appeared to be reluctant to leave. As Ling stepped out of the alley, a man wearing a gray long gown approached him head-on. Just as Ling turned to look, gunshots rang out. Ling was shot and fell to the ground. After killing Ling, the assailant ran back into the alley and disappeared shortly after.</p>
<p>▲ Fatal Gunshot to the Head: After being shot, Ling's body fell at the entrance of the west alley of Dexing Lane, attracting a large crowd of onlookers. He was lying on his back, with his head to the north and feet to the south, with his hands pressed against his abdomen, as if in great pain. There was a bullet hole below his left eye, the flesh was mangled, and blood flowed everywhere. Because his skull was shattered and his brain matter was spilling out, he could not be saved. After hearing the news, the Hongkou Police Station immediately dispatched detectives to the scene to apprehend the assailant and transported the body to the morgue for examination.</p>
<p>▲ Two Theories on the Reason for the Assassination: Although the reason for Ling's assassination can be speculated, there are many clues, making it difficult to pinpoint a single cause. Some say that Ling had considerable influence in the Hongkou area and was involved in matters related to gambling clubs, which may have caused him to make enemies. Others say that after Ling joined the Public Security Bureau, his work may have offended factions within the opposition, leading to him being targeted unknowingly by his enemies. Both theories are presented as possible explanations for Ling's death.</p>
<p>▲ Stray Bullet Injures Elderly Woman: It was said that Ling Runxiang was also carrying a handgun for self-defense, but it was of no use to him. A stray bullet struck Wu Shenshi, the owner of the Wu Yuanchang tobacco and paper shop, injuring her head. The bullet entered below her eye, causing severe injuries. She was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment by police car.</p>

<p>Bodies Discovered in Wusong</p>
<p>Hao, a 36-year-old man from Huai'an, worked as a teacher in Shanghai. He was reserved and rarely smiled. In January of this year, Hao met a woman named Fu Yushi in the French Park. Ms. Fu, 38 years old and from Nanxiang, was beautiful and well-educated. Her husband, Mr. Fu, had been sent on a military expedition years ago and is now stationed in Guangzhou. Ms. Fu's husband was far away and unable to return, she felt restless and unable to control herself. Hao and Fu Yushi met unexpectedly and immediately connected with each other. Over time, they became intimate and engaged in illicit behavior. They rented a house together at the bottom of Dapu Bridge in the French Concession and opened a small restaurant, with Fu Yushi in charge of everything. However, after the restaurant opened, business was slow, and they suffered significant losses, accumulating debt. By the end of last month, the restaurant could no longer be sustained and had to be closed. Creditors, seeing the closure of the restaurant, repeatedly pressed the couple for payment. Hao and Fu Yushi were unable to cope and arranged to settle all debts by the end of the month. On the 25th of this month, Fu Yushi went around borrowing over 250 dollars from friends and relatives. However, that night, while Hao and Fu Yushi were chatting, they inadvertently mentioned that Hao had once won over a thousand dollars in a single night at a roulette table. The two became greedy and immediately hired a rickshaw to take the 250 dollars they had borrowed during the day to a gambling den near Dongxin Bridge to make a final gamble. Unexpectedly, within an hour, all 250 dollars were lost. After returning home, they blamed each other. Realizing that the end of the month was approaching and they were unable to pay their debts, they became deeply saddened and decided to commit suicide. The previous morning, they wrote several suicide notes and mailed them to friends and relatives, expressing their feelings and announcing their intention to drown themselves in the sea at Wusong. In the afternoon, the two took a train to the seaside of Paotaiwan in Wusong. While no one was around, they held hands and drowned themselves in the sea. Around 7:00 PM that afternoon, a patrol boat from the Wusong Port Life Saving Bureau recovered a male corpse wearing a snow-flake woolen Zhongshan suit and yellow leather shoes in the middle of the breakwater at Paotaiwan. As the body was unidentified, the Bureau filled out a corpse tag and sent it to the morgue for encoffining. Around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, Hao and Ms. Yu's friends and relatives received the suicide notes and immediately went to the Wusong Life Saving Bureau to inquire. They confirmed that the two had indeed committed suicide. Later, Ms. Fu Yushi's body was also discovered on the bank of Yinhangpu at 11:00 AM yesterday morning. Her friends and relatives purchased a coffin and took her to the Siming Public Association for temporary storage, and reported to the Hao family in Huai'an to quickly come to Shanghai to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Negotiations Regarding the Shanghai Theater's Performance of "The Resurrection of a Dancing Girl" <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>After the Special District Court sentenced Tong Sanmao to two years in prison, the Shanghai Theater adapted his story into a play called "Tong Sanmao and a Certain Dancing Girl." However, on the eve of its premiere, Tong Sanmao's representatives, lawyers Liu Shifang and Zou Yuzhi, warned the theater to cease the performance and requested the Special District Court to issue an injunction against the theater. The following night, the theater changed its performance to a new play called "The Resurrection of a Dancing Girl," which was completely different from "Tong Sanmao and a Certain Dancing Girl." However, the advertisements published in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao on the day of the premiere were sent in before 6:00 PM the previous day. After receiving the warning from lawyers Liu and Zou, the theater requested the newspapers to remove the advertisements, but it was too late. Therefore, they were deeply understood by Tong's representatives. However, yesterday, lawyers Liu and Zou, fearing that the theater's performance of "The Resurrection of a Dancing Girl" was simply a renaming of "Tong Sanmao," requested the Special District Court to issue an injunction to order the Shanghai Theater to stop the performance. The court reasoned that the Shanghai Theater was performing "The Resurrection of a Dancing Girl" and could not prohibit it, and therefore could not grant the request of Tong's lawyers.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Xi Ehan's Land Rent Brokerage Lawsuit <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Closing Arguments</p>
<p>Xi Ehan leased over seven mu of land located in the middle section of Zhejiang Road to Huang Chujiu for the construction of buildings. Since the lease agreement was established on August 1st of last year, a series of lawsuits have arisen. Initially, the tenants there filed a lawsuit against Xi, then Xi and Huang sued each other. Now, Chen Guifu, the broker who acted as the middleman for the land lease, is suing Xi for embezzling his due share.</p>
<p>Initially, Chen Guifu and Kong Jingqing introduced Huang Chujiu to Xi Ehan. After several negotiations, an annual rent of 72,500 taels and a lease term of 20 years were agreed upon, totaling 1.45 million taels in rent. The agreed-upon brokerage fee was 2%, amounting to 29,000 taels. Kong Jingqing, as the middleman for Huang Chujiu, was to receive half of the amount, totaling 14,500 taels. Chen Guifu, as the middleman for Xi Ehan, was to receive the other half, but he did not receive a single penny. He later learned that Xi had taken it all, so Chen sued Xi for embezzlement. Xi firmly denied this, stating that the agreed-upon brokerage fee was calculated at 2.5% of the total rent for 20 years, with 1% going to the brokers on both sides, 1% to the landlord's accounting department, and the remaining 0.5% to the tenant's accounting department. Chen's share was not embezzled by him. Therefore, he also retained lawyers Jiang Yiping and Qin Liankui for his defense. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhou continued the hearing, summoning land broker Liu Hongsheng, who had been involved in the matter, to testify. Liu testified that Chen Guifu received over 8,000 taels of the brokerage fee from the landlord's side, while he received nothing. He had sued Chen in the local court in the city and received 600 dollars to settle the matter. Zhou, the accountant for Xi Ehan, also testified that his accounting department received 14,500 taels for the brokerage fee, and Kong also received 14,500 taels. The remaining 0.5% was received by Huang Chujiu's accounting department. Kong Jingqing testified that as Huang's middleman, he should have received 14,500 taels, while Chen, as Xi's middleman, did not actually receive any money. Chen was later sued by Liu, and he gave him 400 dollars to settle the case. Although the initial receipt stated that the brokerage fee was 2.5%, Huang only agreed to pay 2%, so the receipt was not valid. Huang Chujiu arrived at the court after 11:00 AM. He testified that the brokerage fee was indeed only 2%, with half going to the middleman on the landlord's side and half to the middleman on the tenant's side. His accounting department did not receive anything. Before the brokerage fee for Xi Ehan's side was paid, Xi's second concubine called his family and told them not to pay it to his accounting department. Therefore, he prepared a check for 14,500 taels on the day of the signing. When it came time to sign, Xi demanded that the brokerage fee for his side be paid to him, otherwise he would not sign. He then handed the check to Xi. The plaintiff, Chen Guifu, was indeed the initial introducer of this matter and had come to his house once. At the end, the lawyers on both sides made their closing arguments, and the court announced that a verdict would be delivered at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Shenghuasheng Rice Boat Capsizes <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Crew Member A Mao Falls into the River and is Missing</p>
<p>The Shenghuasheng rice boat from Wujiang recently loaded 180 dan of white rice in Wujiang to be delivered to the Renji Rice Shop in the north of Shanghai. The day before yesterday afternoon, while sailing on the southern Huangpu River near the Du Jia Hang, it grew dark. The boat anchored there overnight. Unexpectedly, a strong wind arose in the evening, and the wind grew more intense after midnight, accompanied by heavy rain. The wind and waves caused the Shenghuasheng and its crew to secure the mooring ropes, but the crew member A Mao fell into the river. The boat also capsized in the wind, but fortunately, it did not sink because it was near the shore. All the rice was soaked. Yesterday, a boat was hired to raise the boat. Many tools were lost. The Renji shop hired a boat to unload the rice from the Shenghua, and sell it to sugar factories for use in boiling sugar. Each load was sold for only six dollars. The losses are estimated to be considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Gun and Ammunition Hidden in Ceramic Basin <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>▲Selling Old Goods Turns Out to be Selling Guns and Ammunition</p>
<p>▲Chasing Robbers Turns Out to be Chasing Gun Traffickers</p>
<p>Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, Yan Huating, a police officer from the Second Watch Post of the First Precinct of the Second District of Shenxiang Pavilion in Nanshi, was on duty in Zhangchuan Old Lane when he noticed a crowd gathered in front of the Changtai Brick and Tile Shop at number 40. They were focused on a man buying old goods. Before long, someone suddenly shouted "Thief!" The old goods buyer and another person abandoned their load of old goods and fled, pursued by several people. After turning south onto Houjia Road, they fled to the front of the police station. Chief Qian, who was in the office, heard the commotion and immediately ordered Patrol Leader Wang Zhongqing to cooperate with Jiang Xiling, a police officer from the First Watch Post in front of the station, to intercept the suspects. After pursuing them to Hengde Lane, they apprehended the two men and brought them and the pursuers to the station. After questioning, Chief Qian learned from the pursuers that they saw the two men whispering to each other by the side of the road. Then, they saw that one of the men was carrying a stack of ceramic basins containing guns and ammunition, so they shouted "Thief!" Chief Qian then ordered Patrol Leader Wang to immediately go to the Changtai Brick and Tile Shop at number 40 of Zhangchuan Old Lane and bring back the abandoned load of old goods and stack of ceramic basins. After carefully examining them, they indeed found two Browning pistols, numbers 131004 and 231010, and 189 rounds of ammunition hidden in the ceramic basins. The method of concealment was quite clever. There were a total of twenty ceramic basins, but only the top and bottom ones were intact. The centers of the other eighteen basins were removed, and the guns and ammunition were hidden in the empty space. The stack was then tied with hemp rope in a cross pattern to make it look inconspicuous. It is unknown how a passerby discovered this and led to their arrest. Upon questioning, one of the defendants identified himself as Zhao Rugen, 45 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at 104 Yanhai Lane, and a buyer of old goods. He stated that one of the men approached him and offered to sell a stack of ceramic basins for 1.40 dollars. He was about to pay when someone suddenly shouted "Thief!" He claimed to have no knowledge of the guns. The other defendant identified himself as Zhang Xilang, 40 years old, from Chongming, residing in the Wengjia Lane in Nanshi. He stated that he bought a stack of twenty ceramic basins in a porridge shop this morning for 2.40 dollars, and was intending to sell them when he was arrested, but he had no knowledge of the hidden weapons. Chief Qian, based on the fact that Zhang Xilang bought the basins for 2.40 dollars but was willing to sell them for only 1.40 dollars, suspected that there was something else going on. Due to the case involving hidden weapons, he prepared a document to transfer the suspects and the seized items to the Judicial Section for further investigation.</p>

<p>Contraband Hidden in Zhengda Steamer's Wooden Planks</p>
<p>Wu Minzhen and others, patrol leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team, were patrolling the river by sampan around 10:00 PM the night before last when they saw the Zhengda Steamer docked at the Dada Wharf. The ship had not yet weighed anchor, so they boarded the ship to conduct an inspection. They found three bundles of wooden planks next to the cabin with no one guarding them. They asked around for the owner of the items, but no one responded, and grew suspicious. The officers proceeded to inspect each bundle of planks. They discovered that the top and bottom planks were solid, but the other planks had been hollowed out. Inside, they discovered nine boxes of red pills, approximately eighty thousand in total. They immediately confiscated everything and returned to the team. Captain Xu believed the matter was of illegal contraband.  He ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the Third Section of the Municipal Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>

<p>False Alarm on Shanghai-Hangzhou Train</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the fourth special express train from the North Station to Hangzhou on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was approaching Fanwangdu Station. Xia Jingyu, a sergeant and inspector on the train, and three other military police officers, saw Bu Yunzhou, a platoon leader from the First Regiment of the Guard Brigade, sitting in second class with a pistol at his waist. Two soldiers followed, each carrying a bomb. Sergeant Xia Jingyu asked Bu Yunzhou about this. Bu Platoon Leader said that he was going to the Longhua Headquarters on official business. Xia asked him to change to third class, but Bu refused, leading to a confrontation. One of the soldiers carrying a bomb then threw the bomb. Fortunately, it did not explode. When the ticket inspector on the train saw this dangerous situation, he stepped forward and tried to persuade both sides, preventing a worse incident. However, the passengers had already been frightened.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Seeking Divorce Due to a Hidden Ailment <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Wang Shiqing's Weak Body and Seminal Emission</p>
<p>Wu Muying's Mental Anguish</p>
<p>Local young woman Wu Muying (also known as Wang Wu's wife), is currently twenty years old. In the autumn of last year, she married Wang Shiqing. However, Wang suffers from a hidden ailment, leading to a marriage in name only, with no conjugal relations. For the sake of her lifelong happiness, Wu Muying has hired lawyer Wang Yanlun to file for divorce in the local court and request alimony. Her statement roughly states: The plaintiff, in September of last year, married the defendant Wang Shiqing under the arrangement of her parents, mediated by He Fufu, Zhang Songquan, Zhang Sihai, and others. Only after the marriage did she discover that the defendant suffered from a disability. The plaintiff did not wish to be his spouse, but the defendant concealed it deeply, forbidding any disclosure. The plaintiff was also ashamed to speak of it. It was not until she returned to Ningbo in March of this year that she confided in her parents. When questioned, they claimed they were unaware at the time and would never have acted as matchmakers if they had known beforehand. The plaintiff's parents, unclear about the truth, agreed with the defendant on a date to visit a doctor for examination. The defendant, however, preemptively consulted a doctor who stated that his vital energy was weak, he was incapable of sexual intercourse, he could not achieve an erection, he experienced seminal emission at the sight of a woman, his penis was small, there was no hope for offspring, this condition was incurable, and he had been suffering from chronic deficiency and depletion for a long time. This proves that the defendant has a long-standing incurable disability. According to current laws, if either party has a disability or illness at the beginning of an engagement, both families must be clearly notified and each should act according to their wishes. Otherwise, the marriage is unlikely to be fully valid, whether or not they are already married. The other party is entitled to request annulment or divorce. This has already been established as a precedent by the Supreme Court (see Case No. 23, Shang Zi, Year 17). Now, the defendant has a long-standing disability and did not provide clear notification at the time of the engagement or obtain the consent of the other party. Although they are already married, divorce should be granted according to precedent. Furthermore, the defendant does not fulfill his conjugal duties to the plaintiff, providing only the bare minimum of food. If unexpected guests arrive, he would give the food meant for the plaintiff to them, ignoring her hunger. Since the plaintiff returned to Ningbo, she has been refused entry back home, which is equivalent to abandonment, disregarding her livelihood. In terms of daily treatment, there is no affection and it is difficult to grow old together, so divorce should be granted. The reason for this divorce request originates with the defendant, and the plaintiff feels deeply mentally distressed. Moreover, she has no means of support after the divorce. At the very least, she should be paid a one-time alimony of 280 yuan to maintain her livelihood. Yesterday at 9 a.m., Judge Du specially opened the Second Court to hear the case. Both parties complied with the summons and appeared in court. The plaintiff, Wu Muying, wore a printed white Indian silk qipao, had short hair, and wore white silk shoes with red flowers and white socks. She was of medium height and had a pleasing appearance. The defendant, Wang Shiqing, wore a short shirt and trousers made of dark glossy silk, iron-machine satin shoes, had short hair in a flat-top style, and was short and stout with a purplish complexion, not appearing to suffer from a debilitating disease. After the judge took his seat, Wu Muying testified first, stating that she was 20 years old, from Shanghai, and currently residing at her mother's home at No. 830 Hengtai Lane, Zhoujiazui Road, Hongkou. (Question) When did you get married? (Answer) September 21st of last year. (Question) When did you return to Ningbo? (Answer) March 25th of this year. (Question) Why are you suing your husband? (Answer) I am requesting a divorce. (Question) Is it because of illness that you are seeking divorce? (Answer) Yes. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer, Mr. Wang, presented the doctor's examination report and the defendant's handwritten letter to the court for inspection. After reviewing them, the judge ordered the defendant, Wang Shiqing, to testify. He stated that he was 28 years old, from Shangyu, Shaoxing, residing at No. 8, workshop of the Huafeng Yarn Factory in Wusong, and currently working as an electrician. (Question) What illness do you suffer from? (Answer) Since I was 24 years old, I have suffered from seminal emission. It continues to this day, and I have two or three wet dreams every month. (Question) How much do you earn each month? (Answer) At most, 33</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>dollars, at least 22 or 23 dollars. (Question) Can your illness be cured? (Answer) I have seen a doctor, and they said it could be cured, but I don't have the money for treatment. (Question) How did your illness start? (Answer) According to the doctor, it's because my body is weak, so after working hard during the day, I often have wet dreams and seminal emission. (Question) Who did you consult? (Answer) Dr. Ma Xiangsi at Daqing Lane in the New World. (Question) She wants a divorce, what are your thoughts? (Answer) I don't want it. When I married her, we spent 916 yuan together. It's not easy for a craftsman like me to marry a wife. (Question) Your illness won't get better if you don't treat it. (Answer) I need to treat it. After obtaining the testimony, the judge told the plaintiff's lawyer, "It would be best to settle this case out of court." Lawyer Wang said, "My lawyer previously notified the defendant, asking him to come for a settlement, but he never came, so we filed the lawsuit." The judge then instructed them to attempt an out-of-court settlement within ten days. If no settlement is reached, another hearing will be scheduled and a judgment will be made according to the law. The court was then adjourned.</p>

<p>Greedy Xu Yinru</p>
<p>Furious Zhu Musheng</p>
<p>Zhu Musheng, a farmer from the 90th District of Nanhui, Pudong, is over fifty years old. He owns several acres of land, enough to live comfortably. He is a small, well-to-do farmer. However, he has no sons, causing him anxiety like Bo Dao [a figure in Chinese history known for having no heir]. He only has three daughters. The two eldest daughters are already married. The third daughter, named A Wugu, is twenty-nine years old and has a beautiful appearance, a demure young lady. Her parents cherish her as the apple of their eye, intending to choose a good husband to marry into the family, inherit the family property, and continue the family line. Therefore, they are very strict in choosing a husband, and no one has been selected yet. Xu Yinru from Fengxian, who works as a tailor, is currently in his twenties. He is a licentious man. He learned that the Zhu family was well-off and that A Wugu was young and beautiful, so he used tailoring as an excuse to secretly seduce her. Wugu had no men around and little knowledge of the world, so she was eventually tempted by him and fell in love. This summer, Xu even incited Wugu to abscond to Shanghai with clothing and cash, staying in a hotel for over a month. Although Zhu discovered that his beloved daughter had been abducted by Xu, he dared not pursue the matter in Shanghai because Xu was associated with a "leader" and associated with ruffians. Unexpectedly, Xu, not content with what he had, sent a letter to the girl's parents, Zhu Musheng, the other day, forcing them to acknowledge him as their official son-in-law and inherit their property. Zhu was furious after reading the letter. He has already found out where Xu is hiding and hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the local court, requesting that the case be thoroughly investigated immediately to deter abduction and seduction.</p>

<p>Ding Xianchun from Shandong came to Shanghai last month to seek employment and stayed at the home of his fellow villager, Li Jizhong, at No. 256 Huade Road. Li runs a pancake stall. Ding, having stayed for a long time, occasionally helped with the work. Last Saturday at 8 a.m., Ding and Li went out together. When they reached the Linqing Road Bridge, an argument suddenly broke out. Li accused Ding of stealing four yuan in cash from him. Ding angrily slapped Li in the face, and they started fighting each other. Ding's scrotum was kicked by Li, causing injury that could not be cured, and he died shortly after. The police station in charge arrested Li. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special District Local Court, where he was interrogated by Judge Feng Shide. The police station presented four yuan and twenty cents in cash found on the deceased's body as evidence. According to Li's confession, it was just a joke at the time. Who knew that the deceased would become angry out of shame? He also denied kicking. However, the police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, claimed that according to the doctor's examination, the deceased's genitals were severely injured, indicating that he was indeed kicked. Judge Feng ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody, awaiting sentencing at a later date.</p>

<p>Ruffians Dare to Fleece a Hotel Guest</p>
<p>Wang Yonggen originally ran a teahouse in a town in western Shanghai. Recently, due to his wife Wang Lanying's illness, he brought her to Shanghai on the 15th of this month to seek medical treatment, staying in Room 1 of the Huaiyang Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. Unexpectedly, at 10 p.m. on the 25th, Zhu Guishou, a ruffian nicknamed "Little Suzhou," accused Wang of being a kidnapper and gathered eight accomplices. Zhu, wielding an axe, rushed into Wang's bedroom and demanded fifty yuan. Wang was penniless but afraid of his power, so he agreed to give him fifteen yuan. He borrowed the money from Chen Ziming, a tea servant at the hotel, but only got ten yuan. He gave the money to Zhu in full, and the remaining five yuan would be paid the next day. Zhu then took the money and left with his accomplices. The next day, Zhu went again to demand the remaining five yuan. At this time, Wang realized that he was being fleeced, so he immediately reported it to the police and was arrested by the Huishi Police Station. Yesterday, he was brought to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi proposed the case. Wang and his wife appeared in court and explained that they brought his wife to Shanghai for medical treatment and were temporarily staying at the hotel when Zhu falsely accused him of being a kidnapper and gathered accomplices to fleece him. When questioned, the ruffian falsely claimed that he was having an affair with Wang Lanying, so he borrowed ten yuan from her, etc. Judge Wu Tingqi, finding that Zhu Guishou was guilty of extortion, sentenced him to one year and six months in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>Gu Changsheng, a local resident of No. 25, Luban Road in the French Concession, is 26 years old and makes a living by growing vegetables. Every morning, his mother and sister take the produce to sell in the Ximen area. His sister, named Linmei, is 28 years old and has a beautiful appearance, a pretty young lady. She and her mother sell vegetables, going out in the morning and returning at noon, which is their daily routine. However, the other day, her mother fell ill and was bedridden, so Linmei went to sell vegetables alone. For several days in a row, business was quite good. Unexpectedly, a neighboring vegetable stall owner, Hong Chen, an old woman from Shaoxing, is 66 years old. She lives on the Xieqiao Jumen Road. Seeing that Linmei was extremely beautiful and that she was not yet married, she knew that there was a lot of profit to be made, so she enticed her with sweet words every day. Linmei was young and ignorant and was eventually bewitched. On the 8th day of the fifth lunar month, the old woman saw that the time was ripe and took Linmei to live with Chen Tang, a local resident at No. 105 Yangjiazhai, Pudong, to plot to sell her for a good price. Her brother Changsheng saw that his sister had not returned that day and knew that something was wrong, so he inquired around, but found no news. It was not until the other day that he learned from a friend that she had been abducted to Pudong. In the evening, he crossed the river and went to Yangjiazhai according to the address, and found her. Linmei had already been betrothed by Hong Chen to a certain person as his wife, with an agreed bride price of 160 yuan. The deal was about to be completed when Changsheng suddenly broke in, ensuring that his sister's chastity was preserved. The person who wanted to buy her saw that things were not going well and immediately slipped away. Changsheng then called the police, who took Hong Chen and the landlord Chen Tang to the Fourth Team of the Police. That night, they were taken to the First District. After questioning, District Chief Ren confessed to conspiring to sell Linmei and ordered that the defendant and all witnesses be brought to the Local Court for questioning yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Wang Yiren is Arrested for Extortion <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Wang Yiren's home in Yifeng Lane, Jisi Street, Caojiadu, western Shanghai, received threatening letters from bandits in April of this year, demanding money. Later, he sent his coachman Yan Chaolong to hand over ten dollars to the designated location on Yidingpan Road. On the 24th of this month, he suddenly received another threatening letter, demanding a large sum of money and designating the Andong Hotel in the Public Concession as the contact point. Wang was required to send someone to the hotel first to book a room and write Wang Yiren's name on the water sign. Someone would contact him. After receiving the letter, Wang immediately reported it to the Sixth District Police Station in charge. After receiving the report, District Chief Ren ordered detectives Liu Shaoqing, Tang Bingxiang, and Gan Youxin to disguise themselves and go to the Andong Hotel at 6 p.m. on the 26th, book Room 313, and write Wang Yiren's name on the water sign. At about 8 p.m., a call came to contact them. The bandit claimed that 5,000 yuan was indispensable, and the detectives pretended to be Mr. Zhang, representing Wang, and replied that the amount was too large, and Mr. Wang only had three to four hundred yuan. The bandit then agreed to meet at Room 412 on the fourth floor of the Oriental Hotel. The detectives went as agreed. Unexpectedly, there was no one in that room. They waited for a long time but no one came. The detectives also opened a room to investigate at any time. It was not until after 12 o'clock that they saw a bandit enter the room and sleep peacefully. Detective Liu and others immediately reported to the Old Gate Police Station and sent detectives to join them. At about 6 a.m. the other day, they went to that room and arrested the bandit Huang Yijun. After interrogation by the Special District Court, they were allowed to be transferred. The detectives took the bandit back to the Sixth District Police Station. After interrogation by District Chief Ren, the bandit confessed that his name was Huang Yijun, also known as Ahe, 26 years old, from Songjiang, living at Yongze Third Lane, West Gate, Chenqian Street, jobless. On the afternoon of June 21st, he was smoking in Yanzhiwo, Baoyu Lane, French Concession, when he talked to Chen and Xie Baogen. Xie said that there was a business opportunity, that Wang Yiren, a doctor at Caojiabo Yifeng Lane, could be threatened by letter and extorted a large sum of money. Later, the three of them went to Wuzhen Road, Zhabei, and asked Zhu Jingru to write a letter, which Xie personally sent. It stated that Wang Yiren must book a room at the Andong Hotel and send someone to contact him. On the afternoon of the 26th, I went to Andong to take a look and saw that Wang Yiren had booked Room 313. I was afraid that it was not appropriate, so I went to Taihechun to make a phone call and learned that the representative, Mr. Zhang, had been sent. I said that it must be 5,000 yuan. Mr. Zhang agreed to three or four hundred yuan. I then agreed with Zhang to meet at Room 412 of the Oriental Hotel. Later, I waited outside and saw three or four people coming, whose shape was suspicious, so I went elsewhere. Because the room had already paid the room fee of three yuan, I went to sleep alone at twelve o'clock and was arrested at dawn. District Chief Ren then ordered the coachman Yan Chaolong to identify the bandit, who was indeed the person who had received ten dollars in April. He also ordered the bandit to write numbers, which were the same as the handwriting in the threatening letter. The bandit's threat and extortion were proven to be conclusive, so he prepared a document yesterday and sent the bandit, along with the letter, to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>An Overview of Chinese Folk Literature (Continued) Written by Yang Yin Shen</p>
<p>Chapter Two, "Folk Literature and Literature," systematically describes the value of folk literature and what is commonly referred to as literature, as well as their relationship and differences, so that we have a deeper understanding of folk literature. According to the author's observations, there is no significant difference between the value of folk literature and what is commonly referred to as literature. That is to say, they are one and two, two and one. At the same time, they have a close relationship because many aspects of literature rely on folk literature. This is the inherent noble position of folk literature.</p>
<p>Literature is evolving. Therefore, the first thing that emerged was poetry, which also evolved from the songs of primitive peoples. This is described very clearly and thoroughly in this chapter, and it cites the formation of ancient Greek literary odes and epics, which are closely related to the myths and legends of their time and even draw material from them. This makes the argument of this book more explicit, and readers can certainly believe it without a doubt.</p>
<p>According to the author's research, there are four differences between folk literature and literary literature in terms of nature and form. First, oral vs. written. Second, mass vs. individual. Third, common vs. aristocratic. Fourth, natural vs. embellished. The arguments are mostly based on objective facts, and I don't need to explain them further, because looking at these four subheadings can reveal something of them. From these points of view, folk literature actually surpasses literary literature in some respects.</p>
<p>Chapter Three, "The Origin of Folk Literature," describes how folk literature came into being and why it came into being. The so-called folk literature came into being, and how did folk literature evolve and why did folk literature permanently exist among the people? The author has expounded on all these kinds of questions.</p>
<p>In fact, before "literature flourished," there was already folk literature "passed down by word of mouth." The emergence of literature is nothing more than "emotion moving within and taking shape in words." The formation of folk literature certainly cannot escape this example. Literature originates from poetry, and poetry originates from songs. These songs are generally the earliest form of folk literature. Their themes are mostly related to gods, and thus "mythology" was produced. Other forms such as "legends," "fables," "ballads," "riddles," "current tunes," etc., were mostly influenced by foreign "Buddhist music" and the promotion of literary literature. This chapter explores the relationship between literature and life in detail.</p>
<p>Chapter Four, "The Value of Folk Literature." The value described here is explored from another perspective, because it has already been said that its position in literature is equal to that of literary literature, and it even tends to surpass it. First, it can serve as "supplement to high education." Second, it can serve as "academic reference." Third, it can serve as "administrative basis." Fourth, it can serve as "life adjustment." The arguments are insightful and make us understand that folk literature not only has considerable value in itself, but also occupies many important positions in other aspects.</p>
<p>Of course, we should clarify the scope of folk literature. In Chapter Five, "Classification of Folk Literature," the author uses keen eyes and correct goals to identify the categories that truly belong to folk literature, for example:</p>
<p>The first category, "stories," can be divided into four types: 1. Myths ("stories containing religious elements"); 2. Legends ("stories containing historical elements"); 3. Anecdotes ("stories containing humorous elements"); 4. Fables ("stories containing satirical elements").</p>
<p>The second category, "songs," is also divided into four types: 1. Nursery rhymes ("songs sung by children"); 2. Mountain songs ("songs sung by adults"); 3. Current tunes ("general songs with chapters and melodies"); 4. Riddles ("general songs with hidden meanings"). The third category, "scripts," is only divided into two types: 1. Lyrics ("scripts with singing but no acting"); 2. Opera ("scripts with singing and acting").</p>
<p>Whether the author's classification is appropriate is not something we should judge strongly, but at least it can give readers a systematic concept. At the same time, Chapter Six, "Works of Folk Literature," is based on the above classification and cites relevant works. If we read it in reference to the above, it will be easier to understand. In each excerpt, the author provides detailed, objective descriptions and explanations. Therefore, this chapter occupies three-quarters of the entire book. The distribution of quantity is inevitably uneven. This seems to be the only drawback of this book.</p>
<p>Although this book is named "An Overview," the Chinese literati have always neglected folk literature. Now, it is possible to discover such a systematic book that studies this type of literature, which is really worthy of our attention. This is like gold mixed with yellow mud, and someone has spared valuable time and energy to excavate it. How much is obtained and whether "gold" can be scooped up is, of course, another question. However, the work that the author is currently implementing is worthy of our praise and should be paid attention to, because it provides a considerable indication for those who study or love folk literature and can also serve as a reference.</p>
<p>What China has is nothing more than a collection of some folk literature. As for books on this kind of research, I am afraid that Mr. Yang's book is the first of its kind. This point alone is enough for me to introduce it here.</p>

<p>The Sincere Company on Nanjing Road and Tianjin Road and the Yude Pool declare that since the pool was taken over by the giant merchant Yang Shunquan last year, its business has been booming. The internal manager, Fang Daoquan, has considerable social skills. To celebrate its anniversary, from August 2, gifts will be given and a type of 20% discount neighborhood coupon will be sold, which can be used all year round. This preferential treatment for customers is a unique approach in the bathroom industry. A grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>
<p>The Miaoji Department Store on North Sichuan Road declares that its ninth anniversary grand sale and prize giveaway will expire at 10 pm on the 31st of this month. After the expiry date, it will definitely not be extended. Counting from today, there are only three days left. The lottery will be held at the company at 9 am on August 1. In addition to reporters being present to monitor the event, all sectors are welcome to visit.</p>
<p>The Huiluo Company on Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road declares that it is the oldest and most reputable department store in Shanghai. It has a cheap one-yuan sale every month and a large winter and summer sale every year. The cheap one-yuan sale only includes parts, old stock, and paintings at one yuan. Other famous and valuable items are not discounted. However, all goods in all departments, whether in stock or new, must be sold at a discount during the winter and summer sales. This summer sale is scheduled to begin next week. All goods have been marked with low prices, especially the women's clothing department, where prices are the most suitable. New fabrics are piled up like mountains, which is breathtaking. At a time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap and prices are soaring, this large-scale sale at such a cheap price is bound to cause a sensation throughout Shanghai. In addition, this large sale will last for one month.</p>
<p>Hanli Company declares that printing equipment in our country has always been old-fashioned, either bulky and difficult to move or complicated to operate. Stencil duplicators come from our eastern neighbors, and the fonts they print are not beautiful. The other various printing tools and paper are few and can only print various floating forms. They cannot print documents that can be permanently retained. The Zhongling pneumatic press has the advantages of clear printing and various printing equipment. It is simple and quick enough to defeat stencil duplicators. At a time when the wave of advocating domestic goods is sweeping the country, our company has emerged with the latest inventions to meet the needs. All sectors are happy to use and promote it without reservation. Government dignitaries have especially praised it. Recently, Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance of the National Government, inscribed a praise: "Inscribed for the Zhongling Printing Machine, the ingenious machine is ingeniously developed and the patterns are new. It has made great contributions to culture and has also recovered rights and interests. How can it be compared to the ingenuity of ordinary machinery?" The inscription ends with Song Ziwen.</p>
<p>The Xu Chongdao Pharmacy declares that it is a giant in the national pharmaceutical industry in Shanghai and has a very long history since its establishment. Due to the development of its business, there are now eight branches and two affiliated branches. The eighth branch has recently opened and is located at the eastern end of Meibaige Road, Jing'an Temple Road. The transportation is convenient, and the location is ideal. Customers are showing great interest. The goods are especially conscientious. The head office and branches specialize in ginseng, bird's nest, and other precious tonics and beverage medicinal materials. At this time of hot summer, summer medicines are on the market, such as Bixun Dan, Xingjun San, and Shiqi Pills, which are all available. Recently, a new all-purpose Shiyao Water has been invented, which is refined with steam using scientific methods. Various floral dew are cooling, appetizing, epidemic prevention, and heatstroke prevention. Sales are very strong, so the staff of the head office and branches have been extremely busy in recent days.</p>
<p>The Hezong Oil Company declares that the American California Union Oil Company has sent a delegation to China to allocate 20 million gold yuan to establish a branch in China to promote the company's products. The delegation has already taken a chartered plane from Shanghai yesterday (the 22nd) to Nanjing, Jiujiang, Yichang, Hankou, and other ports to conduct on-site surveys of all business conditions. The company will use a letter to introduce the delegation to visit various agencies and authorities in various places.</p>
<p>The Guanmei Hat Factory on North Sichuan Road declares that the Taintan brand straw hats and felt hats produced by the factory since its opening have been popular throughout the country and as far as the South Seas Islands. The quality is excellent and the styles are new and unique, and it has long been widely praised. At this time when gold is expensive and silver is cheap, it is a good opportunity to promote domestic goods. In view of this, the factory has specially prepared a large number of felt hats to put on the market. The quality and style are far better than imported ones, and the prices are exceptionally low. This is a good message for promoting domestic goods.</p>

<p>The Haixing Film Company declares that "Tears of the Cold Palace" produced by the company, screenwriter Li Boming, director Dong Tianwei, photographer Dong Tianduo, starring the well-known strongman Cha Ruilong and Ms. Dong Yingying, etc., originally wanted to go to Hangzhou to shoot location scenes, but because the Cold Palace in the film did not have a suitable location in Hangzhou, they wanted to change to Shantou to shoot. It is now determined that Dong Tianwei and Li Boming will go to Shantou first to find scenery, and plan to go to Shantou on July 30.</p>
<p>The Huichong Film Company declares that the film martial arts star Zhang Huichong, who has long been known as the Oriental Fairbanks, has been well received and praised by the audience since he performed novel magic tricks at the Central Grand Theater in this city twice. Zhang, in view of the warm welcome from the public, is devoted to research and continues to invent many great magic tricks. Recently, at the request of all sectors, he is scheduled to perform continuously for three days at the Central Grand Theater from Friday, August 1, to quench the thirst of all sectors. The programs are all rare and unheard of by people at sea, such as the destruction of beautiful women in the middle of the body, the Hong Kong illusion, and the magic box, which are now performed by Nicola in the summer. Zhang also has all of the divine skills that were thought to be unique to Nicola. As for other large programs, all of them are the crystallization of Zhang's personal thoughts, which are far beyond what ordinary magicians can achieve, and all of them will be performed at the same time.</p>
