<h3 id="c10">日本復興成功之感想 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>日本全國努力於復興事業。至今日而完全告成使六年前大地震慘酷荒凉之痕跡。盡數消滅而不稍存留。誠不能不佩日人之能堅毅忍耐。勤勞刻苦。而又有勇敢之氣也。</p>
<p>今日所不能不視爲猶有遺憾者。即此財政棘手緊縮政策之困難耳。因大地震之故。感於緊缩政策之需要。於是事事實行緊缩。今者爲環境所迫。工業金融日見衰敗。乃又感覺緊缩政策之不相宜。於是有主用緩用方針者。有主採積極政策者財政當局之言動。遂亦因此而發現矛盾之象。其予盾之最爲顯著者。即欲勵行產業合理化之政策是也。今日方欲提倡改善中小商工業。以挽救衰頽現狀。而產業合理化之政策。則適驅中小工商業於滅絶之地。今日方欲用保護獎勵方法。以救濟失業工人。而產業合理化之政策。則適以促成失業工人之增加。此非虚擬懸揣之言也。德國勵行產業合理化之成績。已彰彰如是而今乃復欲襲用此政策。以爲緊縮政策之助。政友會乘此矛盾之隙。遂益大肆其攻擊。將來影響所至。吾人誠不易料之。惟今日之所謂緊缩政策與產業合理化。皆因受大地震之影響而產生。而此二者又爲將來政局糾紛之資料。則確爲事實。今日人於此復興成功全國慶幸之際。對此震災所留之徵痕。得母有美中不足之感歟。</p>

<p>妻據隔壁的王家嫂子說。他丈夫往往從睡夢中起來。往來走動。其實他自已並不知道。</p>
<p>夫可憐的人。這是他一天到晚最自由的時候了。我那得也是如此。</p>
<p>老紳士太太。你有兒子麽。婦人有的。只有一個兒子。老绅士　他吸烟麽。</p>
<p>婦人從没有吸過一枝烟。</p>
<p>老紳士這再好没有。烟中有毒。自是不吸爲妙。他也時常上賭塲。上窰子麽。</p>
<p>婦人他足不出户。到晚就睡。</p>
<p>老紳士太太。恭喜恭喜。你的兒子眞是一個模範青年。他今年幾歲了。</p>

<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>春風煦拂。柳綠花紅。以美名冠全國之西子湖。得此天然點綴。將益增其嫵媚。日來裙屐翩翩。摩肩接踵。徜徉於六橋三竺間者。悉皆遠來之游春客也。予客於是。爰摘述春消息以告讀者。</p>
<p>轟動一時之全國運動大會。行將於四月一日開幕矣。連日正在舉行全省運動大會。一時各校健兒。咸精神煥發。爭馳於梅東高橋。而尤以諸女校學生。最爲興高彩烈。一入會塲。則灰其衫而玄其裙者。幾占半數。吾人但聞其拉拉隊呼聲之高。已可想見塲中爭逐之烈矣。</p>
<p>湖上菊部本極蕭條。今歲共舞臺重整旗鼓。聘請小三麻子。李東來。及坤伶何玉蓉。周文艶。醉月娟等。排演飛龍傳。及諸紅生戲。號召力尙不弱。每日上座。恒在五六成以上。西湖娛園則聘有坤伶綠金粉三牡丹。排演新劇天雨花。高廷贊等。觀者滿坑滿谷。極爲擁擠。</p>
<p>湖上旅館。彚設於新市塲。游湖者舟車往返。殊感不便。最近有人擬在孤山邊開設西泠飯店。已在積極籌備中。大約春深時節。即可開幕。屆時游春士女。可免却許多跋涉之勞矣。</p>
<p>博覽會閉幕後。當局爲欲留一永久紀念。特在湖心建築一博覽紀念塔。塔凡三層。盤梯而上。登臨塔巓。全湖在望。美景如畫。亦足快胸襟也。</p>
<h3 id="c108">記西班牙之駢指村 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>吾人操勞卒歳。以十指易衣食者。嘗發奇想。恨不能添一手。增數指。以輔助日常工作。雖曰笑談。或亦人情之常也。邇聞西班牙有駢指集面成村。是不可以不記。</p>
<p>西班牙有一小村。厥名蒲德拉戈。地轄馬德里省境。重巒疊嶂。景色荒凉。其幽靜偏僻。有如晋之桃源洞。與外界接觸殊尠。康莊大道固不能見。即羊腸小徑亦不得通。宅居是村者。凡五十户。一百五十餘人。以耕供食。以農作業。工商士無與焉。村中產石極豐。多劣品。無所用。尤爲農事之障碍。故非窮年栗碌。不堪獲麤食布衣之温飽也。村人唯一特點。手盡六指。居民以指多爲貴。蓋可贊助操作耳。</p>
<p>村有農民某。曾投身軍旅。檢其體格。乃因多指被　棄。不允其入伍。某不服。轉以請檢騐醫士。緣某生長駢指村。耳濡目染。盡屬多指。偶置身村外。則詫五指爲可怪。村中老農。曾語人以駢指之故。謂數百年前。駢指猶不多覯。嗣有一男一女。皆駢指結爲伉儷。後生子孫。即均爲駢指。相傳若干世。降至今日。必六指七指。未嘗或異也。</p>
<p>國人多指者。輒錫嘉名曰六指翁。唯軟弱短小如孩提。不堪持物挈器。等於贅疣。駢指村生長之指則反是。與固有五指。功力相埓。作事可以並駕齊驅。是亦異聞。村多石。稼穡恃勞力。多賴指以輔之。迨有天數存於其間歟。</p>

<p>余於去秋。移居白雲溪上。溪爲吾邑最勝。而余居爲汪氏别墅。又占雲溪之最勝也。左右多名流臺榭。隔岸即蘇東坡紫籘館。及惲南田甌香館。遺址猶存。湯潤之之春雨畫樓。史幹甫之意園。花木亭榭。均在望。溪東折唐家灣。流水一溪。垂楊兩岸。傍即夫子廟。右俯白雲古渡。兩舟銜接。以涉行人。是樓舊名浣雲。下即樂魚水榭。余更顏其堂曰四韻草堂。後即景米軒。藏書雖不滿萬卷。亦足供瀏覽矣。居停汪公瑞麟。今年屆七旬。居樓東偏。門啓則時相過從。腹滿詩書。安閒淵雅。善度曲。年少豪華。誠風流人士也。百花生朝。相邀同好。飲於溪樓。並爲之祝釐。是日微雨如膏。淡雲若絮。趙公明軒。周君企言。余兄春先。先來。明軒善詩古文。春先亦工曲而吹笛。湯澹然丁琴葆劉蘧然繼至。後來者。唐君企林。錢君名山。汪君伯陶也。企林長淮南緝私局已二年。以兵匪固辭不獲。昨自揚州來。贈余有擘窠大書聯曰。硯田無惡歲。酒國有長春。懸之四韻堂中。却稱也。名山往東郊白家橋。距城五里。先生平時黄冠野服。束髮踽踽行。望而知爲隠君子。今夕更披一紫羽</p>
<p>敞衣。亦翩然蒞止。於是華燈旣張。分考詩文。參觀書畫。酒數行後。絃歌互作。蘧然精易學。工詩畫。亦能唱曲。清臞若不食人間烟火者。始唱拾金一曲。琴葆瑞麟繼之、春先吹笛。復弄胡琴。瑞麟輕敲檀板。相繼各度掃花·三醉·說親·會話數曲。余愛聆歌。而雖習小宴中數齣。尙未入門也。企言謂盛世元音。久不聞矣。名山問宮商工尺與蘧然辯論久之。即亦有悟。余謂詩經本古歌謠。今則失傳已久。問昔時旗亭畫壁之黄河遠上一詩。爲宮爲商。無有能應者。企言云泮奂三章。頗似今之小曲。遂試歌之。春先即爲按琴。雖初按此調。居然合拍。餐罷餘興未闌。春先唱劈破玉。瑞麟唱滿江紅。琴葆唱小曲數齣。琴葆年七十三。而音如好女子。誠亦奇趣。時鐘已十二時。寒雨瀟瀟。客始興辭。余以此會頗樂。爰於雨聲淅瀝。夢影模糊中濡筆而爲之記。覺餘音猶在耳也。（不受酬）</p>

<p>— 嵇覲</p>
<p>頃據友人云。虞山某甲。少營商業。薄有資產。其婦才而妬。一無所出。凡家中侍媪。亦必擇奇醜而老秃者任之。時甲年近半百。旣懷季常之懼。復興伯道之嗟。不得已允繼其弟之子爲嗣。旋以平昔所創之店業。分畁掌管。金錢出入。槪不顧問。然乙婦險狠。竟將析產視爲已有。反視兄嫂輩如贅瘤矣。一日。甲奉友召。怱促赴都。即向店中取二十金。以備購送禮物之用。詎爲乙婦所知。大肆咆哮。且怒而駡乙曰。此錢吾兒所有。與此老絶户何爲。其時甲婦偶過窗外。一聆斯語。氣厥倒地。迨甦。爲之哭泣不食者三日。</p>
<p>越半月。得都中函報。知甲已就某機關差。婦心略寛。因即遍託媒婆。物色貧家女子。年可十七八。豐美而宜男者二人。　以重金購之。携而入都。時甲方公暇。與客圍棋。門者白夫人至。大驚。棄子滿地。亟肅之入。詢以來意。謂其專爲送妾來也。終不聽信。未幾。見二姬亦至。綺年玉貎。楚楚可人。因之喜出望外。立就客第居之。婦命輪値待寢。不當夕者留以伴已。如是數月。皆懷姙。踰年。舉二子。婦大喜。乃即治裝返里。云與乙夫婦索賬去。所有財物。悉數收還。並聲言前之所以爲夫覓妾者。爲此（老絶户）三字也。乙婦追悔莫及。卒憂憤而死。</p>

<p>— 震遐</p>
<p>歐洲）基督之邦）Ｃｈｒｉｓｔｅｎｄｏｍ）的道德、雖然是中庸而簡單、充滿了老希伯來的超人生主義、但對於南歐那些熱烈如火·酒與歌·絲與鋼·愛與仇的拉丁民族、他們肉體上的享樂、不顧不切的蠻勇、以及那種寧可先甜後苦、預備滾進地獄去的精神、却總是無法將其軟化、使得他們的靈魂有上天堂的希望、</p>
<p>靠近地中海一带的南歐、本是使徒們傳佈福音最早之處、照理希伯來思想的發達自然須較他處爲濃厚、但同時我們也要曉得、這地中海一带的國土也是希臘文化的根據和發祥地、當基督徒們得勢時、雖然曾仗着羅馬帝國的勢力、將許多希臘文化的表面完全毁去、但希臘思想却早已深入人心、那裏能夠毁得掉、所以即使敎皇高高地坐在羅馬宮中、市民們踐踏着古代英雄的枯骸而高唱讚美詩、但希臘文化的深入人心却仍是如故、北歐諸其督邦、像德荷等國、對於宗敎的典禮、能夠比較地求實際、固然是有新舊兩派的關係、但希臘文化根基的堅固與否、也是一個重要的原因、南歐民衆不但没有被基督敎所冷化、並且還將天主敎的外表、成爲美的藝術、法意西各國遺傳下來的（節日）、大遊行、舉市的狂歡、在古希伯來士師們的眼光裏看來、眞是比西乃山麓的金牛崇拜還要罪過、</p>
<p>羅馬帝國末年的頽廢荒唐、自然使得民衆對於現實的人生發生厭倦、所以彼德保羅們的新氣象便得乘隙而入、將羅馬帝國亡掉·然而這却祇是人類一時的好奇而已、一個眞正有文化的國家、又那裏那夠容納許多對着蒼天祈禱的民衆呢、所以到了結果、偉大的廟宇仍是不得不造、藝術的裝璜仍是不得不絶端講究、</p>
<p>總之、希伯來精神雖然亡掉羅馬、而結果羅馬的希臘精神仍是將希伯來精神消滅、</p>
<p>希滅與希伯來兩種思想互相爭鬭的歷史、當然不是這般簡單、不過世界到了結果、人類在生命裏的功業、却總是不可撲滅的壁壘、不然、藝術遇到宗敎、就無從施其所長了、</p>

<p>— 美國約翰瑪西着胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第三十八章十九世紀的法蘭西散文</p>
<p>那時代的大批評家、這些羅曼斯作家及詩人們的友或敵、但就大體看來、則曾經算是·及依然算是法蘭西文學中的俊傑的友、是聖柏甫、他的重要大抵限於法蘭西、批評是並非直赴離文學底人們的興味很遠的境域的文章的形式、國際上算是重要的批評家的稀少的、委實可以說、批評家在本國以外的什麽國家都没有什麽名譽、聖柏甫有影響於馬太亞諾爾特及其他英吉利的批評家、而歐羅巴的一切文學底批評家恐怕都是從他獲得敎訓的、他的偉大的功績是給法蘭西人、又給世界、他那對於法蘭西文學的明澈的解釋、然而世界却不讀批評之類、聖柏甫的論文有些已經翻譯爲英語了、然而他對於未讀法語者依在是掩閉的書、對於讀法語者、他不但是揭開着的書、且是别人的、他以前的一切法蘭西文學的、又往往經他錯誤判斷的他的同代者例如巴爾札克）的書的揭開者、然而以大體而言、他是以批評底這睿智的直截的判别底光觀察的、聖柏甫以後、任何識字的法蘭西人都没有不理解本國的文學的口實了、而摸索法蘭西文學中最優的東西的任何外國人、也除遵從聖柏甫的指導以外、不會有更好的辦法了、</p>
<p>法蘭西精神的合理底及批評底方面恐怕其最有力的方面罷、雖然法蘭西有着一切形式的文學底藝術上的巨匠、顯現於厄湼斯忒·苪農及ＨＡ　、苪農憑了他的（耶穌的生涯）最爲知名、這是懷疑的兼且敬虔的作品、這同關於宗敎問題的一切書所必有的運命一樣、成爲論爭的材料了、基督敎徒不喜歡這書、異敎徒則爲苪農所意想不到似的利用這書、而苪農自身因爲否認對於文學的一切興味便使問題愈益糾紛了、在他自已想來、他是於文體没有什麽關心的眞理的探求者、是歷史家、然而文學是以赦敵爲報復、而在（耶穌的生涯）之中、見到無論是否分析優美的或（科學底）歷史、却無可否認地算得藝術的作品的書的、這是以豐富的色彩實地描寫的新約全書的闡明底改作、實地描寫云者、因爲這書的大部分、苪農是在叙利亞、在那塲景的中間寫的、他志在作歷史家·批評家·哲學者·東洋學者、他是歷史底藝術家、人們欺騙自已而寫比自已所知更好的東西、而文學、那玄妙的不可解的女神是採納他們的、</p>
<p>像苪農一樣、ＨＡ滕將自已較之文學者倒是看作科學底歷史家及論理學者的、至十九世紀的後半、科學底精神領有一切的思想部門、（科學底）這一詞、連同這一詞所代表思想或方法有些用的太過分、一切人間活動的、甚至色情勾當的科學都有了、這運動是對於羅曼底時代的散漫的思惟的反動、而滕便是在法蘭西的這項運動的指導者、他以爲對於不問政洽家或詩人、凡有天才的人、倘我們確知他的種族·他的時代·他的社會底事情·及他的支配底能力、便能夠將他說明的、在這公式之下、批評大抵是成爲傳記及歷史的問題的、到後來、感到這並没有完全說明人間的天才的批評家提出了對於滕的方法的反對、其實滕自身是超於他所知的詩人、在他的論文中、他的美底熱誠往往將他運出於那聲明的原則之外、在英吉利的讀者看來、他的價値是難量的、因爲他的大著（英吉利文學史）决不能全然爲後代的研究所替代、而從徫大的法蘭西人的視點來看英吉利文學、是極其顯耀的、那英譯極爲出色、</p>
<p>悲哀這東西通常是被當作羅曼底氣質所特有的東西的、然而在法蘭西、稱揚生活的歡悅的是囂俄、喬治桑·仲馬等等羅曼主義者、而算是悲哀而厭世底者則是合理主義底寫實主義者、滕以幾乎陰鬱的斷念觀看人類、而追從巴爾札克的小說家福羅貝爾·莫泊桑·左拉則分得了滕的陰暗的心氣、這並不由於他的影響、却因爲當時的空氣、一部分爲了一八七○年的戰爭是暗黑的這缘故、</p>
<p>考斯道夫福羅貝爾以冷淡的輕蔑、同時又以鋒銳的千里眼底睿智光眺望人間未經使我們發笑的諧謔弄得圓熟的諷刺底的他的人生觀使他的書即在他本國也難以廣泛地普及了、然而於文章之術有興味的讀者看來、福羅貝爾却是完成的極峯、他因爲努力尋求恰當的言辭在僅僅一頁上工作了達一星期之久、而那結果並非修飾底·誇張底·或人工底·却是精確、遵勁·而言辭自然到似乎自已發見似的、他那最有名的小說是（波華荔夫人）、這是哀憐模樣荏弱的女子以及她和單調的鄉鎭裏平凡的人們的放逸的戀事的描寫、這樣的記述、似乎不動人、然而這不但爲了其完全的文體、還因了對於人物的忠實、却是極偉大的小說、那故事用非英雄底的、甚至毫不有趣的材料製成、然而平凡成了非凡、而故事的進行難避得像潮流一樣、雖然重現福羅貝爾的（恰當的言辭）是困難的、那進步和眞實之感在翻譯中（完全的英譯是有的）却也没有失掉、</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person in Beijing received a telegram from Shi Yousan stating: "When our troops arrived in Zhengzhou, the Jin army retreated north, fearing they would return, making it difficult to control them. Currently, we plan to deal with them superficially, luring them south to thoroughly eliminate them in one fell swoop, leaving no future trouble. We also plan to issue a public telegram within days, dealing with Feng and Yan to strengthen their resolve. Feng has long desired me ever since my surrender to the Central Government, and Yan is treacherous and cannot be trusted. I support the Central Government and am unwavering. Please do not worry," etc. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to returning travelers from Beiping and Tianjin, since Yan suddenly changed his attitude, countries such as Italy, the United States, Britain, and Japan have taken this opportunity to increase troops into the country under the pretext of protecting their nationals in North China. Recently, the Jin army dug trenches in Tanggu. The Japanese side, claiming it violated their security zone, dispatched Ueda, the commander of the Japanese military police stationed in North China, to intervene and argued that it violated the agreement made by both sides years ago and will lodge a protest with China.

Chen and others organized a party branch. Yan dealt with them superficially. After Chen withdrew, he said that Yan had not shed the ideas of feudal warlords and bureaucrats and did not know what the party was, making cooperation difficult. (2) Yan appointed Wu Zhankui as the White River Garrison Commander to guard Dagu and increased troops led by Li Shengda to be stationed in the area of Kaitanggu and Lutai, seemingly to prevent Northeast troops from entering the pass. (3) Yan and Feng concluded a mutual aid treaty, agreeing to support each other and not encroach on each other's territory within twenty years. Both parties have already signed it. (4) Feng's war plans depend on Yan's provision of military expenses. (5) Since Shang Zhen was stripped of his military power by Yan and reassigned as the nominal Chairman of Shanxi Province, he has been privately depressed and has long been planning to seize an opportunity to rise again.

<h3 id="e10">Thoughts on the Success of Japan's Reconstruction <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>The entire nation of Japan has dedicated its efforts to the reconstruction effort. Today, it has been fully completed, erasing all traces of the cruel and desolate Great Earthquake of six years ago without leaving the slightest remnant. One cannot help but admire the Japanese people's ability to be steadfast, patient, hardworking, and brave.</p>
<p>What cannot be overlooked today as remaining regrettable is the thorny financial situation and the difficulties of the austerity policy. Because of the Great Earthquake, there was a need for an austerity policy. Now, compelled by the environment, industry and finance are declining day by day, and the inappropriateness of the austerity policy is felt again. Thus, there are those who advocate a gradual approach and those who advocate adopting an active policy. The words and actions of the financial authorities have thus revealed contradictory appearances. The most obvious contradiction is the policy of promoting industrial rationalization. Today, there is a desire to promote the improvement of small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises to save the declining situation, but the policy of industrial rationalization is precisely driving small and medium-sized commercial and industrial enterprises to the point of extinction. Today, there is a desire to use protective and incentivizing methods to relieve unemployed workers, but the policy of industrial rationalization is precisely contributing to the increase in unemployed workers. These are not hypothetical or speculative words. The results of Germany's implementation of industrial rationalization are already obvious, and now it is proposed to adopt this policy as an aid to the austerity policy. The Seiyukai party seized the opportunity of this contradiction and greatly intensified its attacks. The future impact is truly difficult to predict. However, today's so-called austerity policy and industrial rationalization both arose as a result of the impact of the Great Earthquake. These two factors are also material for future political disputes, which is certainly a fact. As people celebrate the success of the reconstruction today, can there not be a sense of regret about the traces left by this earthquake?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Beiping Special City Party Department issued a circular telegram on the 23rd, stating:</p>
<p>The rebel Yan Xishan is a remnant of warlords and a former official of Hongxian. Taking advantage of the times, he seized and occupied Shanxi. When the Northern Expeditionary Army rose up, he opportunistically surrendered. He should have cleansed his heart and started a revolution to cover up his past transgressions. Instead, he schemed and colluded with the socially despised Zhang Zongchang, Wu Peifu, Duan Qirui, and Wang Jingwei, uniting the Anfu clique, the Reorganization clique, the Western Hills clique, and the Northern Warlord clique, all of whom have been abandoned by the people, gathering the remnants of feudal forces to plot the overthrow of the Party and the nation. He even joined Zhang Gui to attack Zhang Gui and joined Feng Tang to attack Feng Tang. The ink of his telegrams declaring his retirement was not yet dry, and his plans to raise troops and rebel were already decided. He is fickle and devoid of faith and righteousness. As for the rebel Feng Yuxiang, he was imprisoned in Jian'an, and his remorse must not yet be felt. Shamelessly serving his enemies, he cunningly seeks to achieve his goals. No one is more shameless than this. Considering the past history of Yan and Feng, they are criminals against morality, righteousness, and shame. If these are not eliminated, how can there be a nation? We hope that comrades and compatriots will rise up and denounce them, jointly advocate for justice, and preserve personality. The Party and the nation will be fortunate. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e36">Naval Conference Hangs by a Thread <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>British Newspapers Mostly Blame Italy and France</p>
<p>Japan's Attitude Deserves Great Attention</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, London, 22nd: French Premier Tardieu told British Prime Minister MacDonald that unless Italy is prepared to abandon its demands for equality with France and concrete guarantees can be negotiated at the conference as a supplement or interpretation of the Pact of Paris, he believes that the participation of French cabinet members in the naval conference would be useless. The British Prime Minister is now seeking to conclude a tripartite agreement with the United States and Japan to avoid the complete failure of the conference. However, many British newspapers have already acknowledged the failure of the conference, stating that the blame lies with France and Italy's unwillingness to compromise. However, opinions vary among the newspapers regarding which country is more at fault. In addition, there are also various comments on Italy's proposal to postpone the conference for six months and reconvene.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 22nd: French Foreign Minister Briand will return to London in the middle of next week as soon as his parliamentary duties permit him to leave France.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd: The Times discusses the naval conference deadlock, stating that a clear determination of whether a five-power agreement can succeed will be made soon. In this situation, the revival of the three-power agreement theory is not surprising. If a five-power agreement is truly impossible, the United States, Britain, and Japan would probably be willing to consider the possibility of a three-power agreement. This matter will naturally depend on the Japanese government's attitude towards the American proposal. If circumstances necessitate discussions between the United States, Britain, and Japan on a three-power agreement, it is almost certain that a safeguard must be included in this agreement. Assuming that the tonnage already discussed by US President Hoover and British Prime Minister MacDonald serves as the basis for the three-power agreement, it would be necessary to stipulate that any decision must be subject to the shipbuilding programs of other naval powers. A three-power agreement could be based on the shipbuilding programs already announced by major naval powers, with the addition of a clause stating that if other countries continue to build ships, any one of the three signatory countries may, after notifying the other two signatory countries, re-examine its position. With this provision, a three-power agreement could be concluded. However, before considering a three-power agreement, all efforts must be made to secure a five-power agreement. Yesterday, the British Prime Minister first met with Stimson for a long time and then had a long talk with the Japanese chief delegate Wakatsuki, discussing the three-power agreement. This morning, the British Prime Minister met with the King of England and presented a detailed account of recent developments.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, London, 22nd: The Minister of Finance's Plenipotentiary stated that the military reduction conference was originally scheduled to end in two months, but that deadline has long passed, and the end date is still nowhere in sight. Considering that domestic affairs in the Ministry of the Navy are being hindered, he plans to leave the conference to Wakatsuki and other plenipotentiaries and return home as soon as he obtains permission from his government. He is currently preparing to depart, approximately two weeks later. It is said that the Minister of Finance's return home has no direct relationship with the current stalemate in the conference, but is merely to handle domestic naval affairs.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd: Colonel Sawamoto of the Naval Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of the Navy met with Director Horita of the European and American Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 2:30 PM yesterday and presented a draft telegram based on the policy of the Naval General Staff. It is reported that the content is to maintain an absolute 70% for 8-inch cruisers, maintain the existing strength of submarines, and maintain a total of 70%. There is no change in the fundamental policy. The method of utilizing and accommodating ship types offers some relaxation in form. If the United States builds more than fifteen 8-inch cruisers, Japan must also build two 8,800-ton 8-inch cruisers as countermeasures.</p>

<h3 id="e42">British Minister of Commerce Clarifies the Significance of the Tariff Truce <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 22nd. British Minister of Commerce, Sir Philip Cunliffe-Lister, in a speech today in Edinburgh, stated that the Geneva tariff truce conference was extremely difficult. Broadly speaking, this conference was aimed at the United States, and was also unrelated to cooperation with various parts of the British Empire. Since the war, tariff barriers have been established everywhere in Europe, and this trend is extremely unfavorable to the United Kingdom. Therefore, any movement that helps to reduce such tariffs is beneficial to the United Kingdom. Today's conference in Geneva has the hope of concluding an agreement guaranteeing existing commercial taxes for at least one year. The situation at the conference is extremely encouraging, and a large part of Europe has now recognized that tariff increases have gone too far, he said.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd. Minister of Commerce and Industry Tawarada presented a proposal at today's cabinet meeting to encourage and widely promote the use of domestic goods to the entire nation. According to his explanation, with the current decline of various industries, it is necessary to encourage the use of domestic goods. The government's overseas payments in the last fiscal year (Showa 4) were 110 million yen. If this could be reduced by half, it would cut the outflow of cash by half and encourage domestic industries, which would help alleviate unemployment, etc. After exchanging opinions, the cabinet members decided to not only address overseas payments but also to encourage and promote the use of domestic goods to the entire nation.</p>

<p>Another Proposal by a U.S. Congressman</p>
<p>Associated Press, Washington, 21st. Congressman Schaemus today introduced a bill in the House of Representatives proposing to allocate special funds to purchase grain in the United States and transport it to China for disaster relief. The limit of the special funds is stipulated not to exceed US$75 million. This bill is generally the same as the suggestion made by Congressman McMaster a few days ago, but McMaster only proposed US$25 million. According to the terms of Schaemus's proposal, China must repay 25% of the total amount in the first year, and the remainder will also be repaid over a period of ten years. McMaster also spoke today, emphasizing the plight of the Chinese disaster victims, and said that during the Great War, the U.S. Grain Corporation had exploited all the wheat farmers in the United States, who had obtained huge profits without any return. Moreover, this move is a pioneering humanitarian effort, so why not do it, etc.</p>

<p>Associated Press, San Francisco, 20th. When the merchant ship President Cleveland was sailing into port today, a ferry approached it.

Unexpectedly, the ferry, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fired a warning shot first. The two sides engaged in a prolonged battle, and the ferry finally escaped in the smoke. Customs officers then searched the President Cleveland and found a package of opium on its deck, worth US$10,000. They are now secretly searching all parts of the ship, hoping to find more.</p>

<p>Ningbo Correspondence. Ningbo Customs Superintendent Chiang Chieh-shih received a telegram from Chairman Chiang yesterday (21st) afternoon, which briefly stated that in addition to inspecting the Yangtze River fortresses, he also needed to inspect the Yin-Feng Automobile Road and return to his hometown to sweep the tombs. He would arrive in Ningbo that day and hoped that cars would be prepared to transfer to Xikou. He asked that no publicity be made to avoid excessive socializing, etc. After receiving the telegram, Superintendent Chiang immediately telegraphed the Yin-Feng Road Bureau to immediately send two cars to the Ningshao Wharf on the north bank of the Jiangbei to wait. Commander Wang Wen-han of the Bandit Suppression Command also rushed to Zhenhai on the Xinjiangtian at 4:00 PM yesterday to greet him. This morning (22nd) at 8:00 AM, Chairman Chiang arrived at Zhenhai on the Chutai warship, landed to inspect the Zhenhai fort, and reviewed the troops. Soon after, he boarded the original ship and, escorted by the Chuyou warship, arrived in Ningbo at 10:00 AM. When the ship reached Baisha, the Chuyou warship first fired 21 salutes, and then the Chutai ship sailed in and docked at the Ninghai Steamer Wharf.

<h3 id="e52">Military Political Training Merged into Special Party Department <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>National Government Instructs Training Supervisory Department to Comply</p>
<p>The National Government yesterday instructed the Training Supervisory Department, stating: "Regarding the letter from the Central Executive Committee stating that the third plenary session of the Third Central Executive Committee discussed and resolved that the affairs of military political training, proposed by the Standing Committee, should be handled by the military special party department, the original proposal, as amended and passed, is enclosed for your reference and instruction to the relevant authorities to comply, etc." Attached is a proposal on how military political training should be merged into the military special party department. Upon receipt of this, we should comply and, in addition to replying by letter, copy and issue the original proposal for compliance and separate notification. The implementation of military political training is the main body of the work of the special party department. However, the old system re-established a political training office to manage it. Based on experience, it is difficult to divide the powers of various parties, and the work is also repetitive. For the sake of today's plan, we should urgently seek merger to unify power and assign responsibility. The following measures are proposed: (1) Except for the Political Training Office of the Training Supervisory Department, all levels of political training offices should be abolished, and matters related to the political training of soldiers should be handled by the military special party department at each level. (2) The military special party department should appoint specially qualified personnel who have passed training and examinations as special commissioners to provide on-site guidance and supervise the implementation of the political training work of each army. (3) For armies that have not established a special party department, the central government will send additional special commissioners to prepare for the organization of the special party department and undertake political training work. (4) The special commissioners in the preceding paragraph will be trained in a special political training class established by the Political Training Office of the Training Supervisory Department. The Director of Training will serve as the head of the training class, and the training program will be approved by the Central Standing Committee. (5) If junior and middle-ranking officers in the army have not received political training, the Political Training Office of the Training Supervisory Department should transfer them to the Central Government in rotation for training in stages.</p>

<h3 id="e53">The Past Diplomatic History of Mongolia and Tibet <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Lobsang Tenzin Reports at the Central Radio Station</p>
<p>Lobsang Tenzin, Director of the Tibetan Affairs Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, recently reported on the diplomatic history of Mongolia and Tibet over the years and the Central Government's intention to treat Mongolia and Tibet at the Central Broadcasting Radio Station. The following is an excerpt from the speech: (Imperialist powers used different means and different utilizations to invade the lands of Mongolia and Tibet. Soviet Russia's invasion of Outer Mongolia was mostly done by inciting the Outer Mongolian people with various propaganda materials. The content of their propaganda said all the bad things about China, and they encouraged the Outer Mongolian Youth League to become independent and autonomous. Because the youth of Outer Mongolia had simple knowledge, they were easily seduced, and there were also traitors among them who echoed and blindly followed. Once they understood that Soviet Russia's policy was to destroy the race of the people of Outer Mongolia, they began to regret it. I am afraid that at that time they wanted to break away, but their hands and feet were tightly bound and they could not get rid of it. Repentance was too late. The success of Soviet Russia's invasion of Outer Mongolia completely relied on the power of propaganda materials. They did not hesitate to spend huge amounts of money on propaganda, and they still thought it was not enough. Last year, they secretly sent detectives to Inner Mongolia with many propaganda materials to collude with local bandits and organize secret agencies, claiming to be Xinjiang merchants but secretly spreading communist fallacies to confuse the public. Fortunately, Inner Mongolia is not far from the northern provinces of China, and the transportation is much more convenient than before. Many ambitious young people from Inner Mongolia have come to the mainland to study. There are also many middle school graduates who have returned to their banners. When they returned to their hometowns, they established private elementary schools and taught the local students. The schools were well-equipped, and there were also many people who had received basic education and had knowledge. Therefore, no matter how Soviet Russia promoted communism, they all knew that communism was harmful to the country and the people, and everyone was afraid and not easily seduced. Regarding Tibet, the United Kingdom secretly harbored the heart of invasion, which actually began in the early years of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty. Because the Qing government did not pay attention to the national defense of the border areas of Mongolia and Tibet, they only sought peace and did mostly perfunctory things when things happened. That year, the Governor-General of India, Warren Hastings, had the ambition to invade Tibet. His first plan was to send Burke as a special envoy to Tibet in 1774, falsely claiming to be traveling but secretly investigating local minerals and customs. Because the monks, laity, and the people of the large and small dependencies of Bhutan and Sikkim strongly opposed it, and the resident minister in Tibet strongly disagreed, Governor Warren saw the fierce opposition of the Tibetans and his plan could not succeed, so he came up with a second plan. On the one hand, he secretly sent British officials with armed soldiers to sneak into the border areas of Bhutan and Sikkim, on the pretext of traveling. On the other hand, he secretly sent idle Indians dressed as British officials to enter the country without authorization. In the past, the border people of Bhutan and Sikkim hated the British people. The Bhutanese people were accustomed to barbarism and liked to be brave and aggressive. They did not know that diplomacy and politics were treasures. Therefore, when the people saw the British special envoy and his entourage, they hated them extremely. They killed the fake special envoy and several of his entourage. Later, Governor Warren discovered it and, according to the original plan, immediately dispatched armed troops, on the pretext of killing British people, and forcibly occupied the border areas of Bhutan. The Bhutanese people refused to submit to the British people's tyrannical behavior and fought fiercely with the British army several times. However, the weak could not defeat the strong. Although the Bhutanese soldiers fought bravely, they ultimately could not support it due to the superiority of the weapons. After the failure, the King of Bhutan, Zhongsa Benlo, requested assistance from the resident minister in Tibet, Selengge. At that time, the Qing government mostly did not know diplomacy and was accustomed to being perfunctory. When forced to, they negotiated with the British several times, but the result was still a failure. From then on, the people of Bhutan lost faith in the Qing government. The British government forced the King of Bhutan to establish a treaty privately. However, the British ambition still thought it was not enough. They wanted to apply the tricks of invading Bhutan to Sikkim. In the second year of Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, the King of Sikkim established a treaty privately with the British. The Tibetans hated the King of Sikkim and regarded him as a traitor. In that year, the Qing government was threatened by the British and forced to sign the Yantai Treaty, allowing British special envoys to enter Tibet. Most of the treaties signed were humiliating to the country and led to a major diplomatic failure. From then on, the powerful British people watched Tibet covetously and hated that they could not swallow it in one bite. They invaded in many ways, but had no opportunity. It was not until the first year of the Republic of China that the Dalai Lama was seduced by the British and declared independence. However, most Tibetans did not agree with this move. However, the former Beiyang government never negotiated with the United Kingdom once on the Tibet issue, which has been delayed until now and has become a long-standing case. Fortunately, in April and May of this year, a Mongolian and Tibetan conference was held, and all Tibetan representatives participated in the conference to jointly discuss ways to resist. Mongolian and Tibetan compatriots must be thoroughly aware, obey the orders of the Central Government, truly understand the Three Principles of the People, build a new Mongolia and a new Tibet under the leadership of the Party, so that the people of Mongolia and Tibet can complete the full success of self-determination and autonomy, and so that the people of Mongolia and Tibet can be a part of the entire Chinese nation. In short, the only way to save Tibet is to promote education first, cultivate talents, so that everyone has knowledge and understands the meaning of the Party, so that they will never be invaded and oppressed by imperialist powers. Recently, our association has received a new message that Nepal is actively preparing for war and wants to fight with Tibet. All military uniforms and bullets have been purchased from India and transported with the help of the British side, who have allowed to give them 2,000 mules to transport them. Tibet is also actively carrying out defense work. Looking at the situation, war between the two sides is inevitable. If it is realized, we in China will face a major problem. This news is not fabricated. Please pay more attention to this news.)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Northern Military Advances by Retreating <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Yan Xishan Suspends Going Abroad Due to Persuasion</p>
<p>But Still Worried About the Northeast</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence. After Yan Xishan telegraphed his resignation from all his current positions, he sent Yue Kaishen and Song Cheming to prepare for going abroad. The 33rd Division of Sun Chu, the 41st Division of Zhang Huizhao, and the 42nd Division of Feng Pengzhu on the Pinghan Railway were all retreating backward. The headquarters of the 43rd Division of Fu Zuoyi also returned to Tianjin from Cangzhou, and there was great hope for peace. Later, the generals of the Second and Third Group Armies telegraphed to retain Yan, and Yan convened a meeting of the generals of the Third Group Army in Bingyuan on the 10th, with representatives from all parties attending. It was decided to postpone going abroad, and the situation changed. Fu Zuoyi went to Bingyuan on the 9th to attend the meeting and returned to Tianjin on the 12th. He announced to the press that the 43rd Division had retreated to Tianjin. In fact, not only did it not retreat, but the 36th Division of Li Shengda also fully opened to Machang to concentrate. The 37th Division of Wang Jingguo also advanced from Fengtai Yangcun to Tianjin. Due to the lack of vehicles, large carts, mules, horses, and laborers were urgently requisitioned day and night. According to those familiar with the situation of the Jin army, what Yan Xishan has always been worried about is Zhang Xueliang in the Northeast. In the past month, no less than a dozen envoys have been sent out to the pass to contact him. Zhang's words are ambiguous and there is no clear expression. Recently, Wen Shouquan was sent to Shenyang again. Wen is very senior in the Jin army and is good at speaking, but it may not be effective. The Huangheyai Railway Bridge on the Jinpu Railway was bombed and destroyed. The Pukou Bureau has sent workers to support it with 2,000 sleepers, which can barely run. The bridge was set on fire again at night the day before yesterday, and the telephone and telegraph south of Dezhou were completely out of service. The passenger train going south from Tianjin originally sold tickets to Dezhou. Since yesterday, it has only been opened to Lianzhen. The 4th Corps of the Jin Army purchased 100,000 bags of rice and flour and 100,000 catties of pickles in Tianjin and distributed them to the various armies for use. According to a certain military strategist, the situation on the Jinpu Railway was very tense in early May. Now the military center of gravity in the north has shifted to the Pinghan Railway. The first contact will probably be on the Longhai Line. It is true that Feng Yuxiang took a light car and followed the Yuncheng Fenglingdu on the 9th before dawn and arrived at Tongguan on the night of the 10th. Military contact may be unavoidable.

<p>[P Lu Army Will Attack Zhucheng Again</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence. Gao Guizi has been trapped in Zhucheng for more than a month. The provincial army stopped the attack a few days ago out of consideration for the people in the city and waited for him to realize his mistake. However, Gao has always been stubborn and has not expressed his intention to surrender. The provincial army will attack again in the next few days. Xu Huating's Independent Regiment of the Qufu Garrison Department took two trains through Jidong today and got off at Caijiazhuang Station to Zhucheng. At 9:45 this morning, a car of explosives was transported with the Jiaoji Railway freight car to Gaomi and then to Zhucheng. It is said that the city walls will be blown open to solve the Gao Department and unify the No. 1 armored car. Yesterday, it also went to Jiaozhou Gaomi area to patrol. It is said that the aircraft of the 2nd Aviation Team will also go to throw bombs at that time. (21st)</p>
<h3 id="e55">Qingdao Trade Increased Suddenly Last Year <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>An Unprecedented Phenomenon Since the Opening of the Port</p>
<p>Since last year, Qingdao has been prosperous in trade, which is unprecedented since the opening of the port. The total import and export trade volume in the 18th year was 166,801,000 customs taels, an increase of more than 24 million taels compared with the 17th year. The reason why the trade increased so rapidly is that the civil unrest stopped last year, the Jiaoji Railway transportation was convenient, the purchasing power of the inland counties increased, and the agricultural output was abundant, so it can have this achievement. The following is a breakdown of the import and export amount: (1) Import amount: A. Foreign goods 58,220,000 taels; B. Domestic goods 28,246,000 taels; Total 86,466,000 taels. (2) Export amount: A. Domestic goods exported to foreign countries 37,266,000 taels; B. Domestic goods exported to domestic ports 43,068,000 taels; Total 80,334,000 taels. Judging from the above numbers, the import of foreign goods has actually increased by more than 13,720,000 taels compared with the 44,497,000 taels in the 17th year, while the import of domestic goods has decreased by 4,836,000 taels. On the export side, compared with the 64,690,000 taels in the 17th year, it has increased by 15,640,000 taels, which is enough to prove that the imported goods are gradually encroaching on the market of domestic goods. As for the situation of merchant ships entering and leaving the port, the total number is 3,865, and the registered tonnage is 6,673,600 tons, an increase of 283 and 858,874 tons compared with the 17th year. Among them, Japanese ships account for 2,230, a total of 3,321,860 tons, and British ships account for 628, a total of 1,498,366 tons. Chinese ships only account for 564, a total of 552,250 tons. The rest are Germany, France, Russia, Italy, the Netherlands, etc. From this, it can be seen that the shipping industry in our country is not prosperous, and the shipping industry in Qingdao is almost monopolized by the United Kingdom and Japan.</p>

It is said that Wu originally planned to go to Harbin and Jilin Heilongjiang and other places to promote, but the National Lawyers Association will hold this year's plenary executive committee in Hankou at the beginning of next month, and the meeting is coming soon, so he had to rush to leave. He has decided to go to Ping by Beining Road tomorrow morning (20th) and then go south. (19th)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Gaoming Ferry in Guangzhou Bombed by Bandits <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. At 12:40 this morning, a loud noise suddenly rang out near Renji Street on the West Bund, startling everyone. At that time, pedestrians in the Bund area suspected that a bomb had exploded and ran away in a panic, which was very embarrassing. The order was restored after a while. After investigation, it was found that the Lianxing Ferry, which shuttled between the provincial capital and Gaoming, was bombed by bandits with a water mine. Recently, the bandits of Luo Ji Hong in Sanshan Shibi and Wei Yong Panpu have gathered in this area, specializing in collecting waterway tolls from the ferries to the West River. If they refuse to pay, they will be subjected to various kinds of sabotage. The ferry has repeatedly received letters from the Luo Ji Hong bandits demanding 5,000 yuan for each trip to Xizhihang and 20 yuan for each trip. The ferry refused to pay and, for self-defense, built gun emplacements with eight-tenths of an inch thick steel plates in the Gaoming small wheel and the ferry and installed eight earth cannons and various sharp guns and hired 24 gunners to prepare to resist the bandits. They were also afraid that the bandits would bomb them with water mines, so they used a grab-type Woji wire mesh to arrange them at both ends of the towline to prevent water mines. The bandits saw that the ferry had set up such strict defenses, so they put up white flags all over the riverbank along Sanshan with the words "Special to Fight the Tiger Boat, Gaoming Lianxing Ferry" written on them, and they fluttered in the wind. They also sent a letter to the ferry on the 14th as a final warning, limiting them to prepare 5,000 yuan within three days, otherwise they would treat them with water mines. The ferry laughed it off after receiving the letter. The bandits hated them even more. At 3:00 PM yesterday, the ferry arrived in the provincial capital from the countryside and berthed at the Hadan Pier, preparing to leave the province at 1:00 AM that night to return to the countryside. At about 7:00 PM, a woman in rural clothes carried a rattan bag to take the ferry. When she got off the ferry, she deliberately threw the rattan bag into the river and shouted that she had lost her luggage and fell into the water. At that time, a man who looked like a coolie stood on the dock and, seeing this situation, jumped into the river, saying that he would find the rattan bag for the woman. It took about 20 minutes before he went ashore and said that he could not find it. It was later speculated that the woman and the man were probably sent by the bandits, and the rattan bag contained a water mine. The man who swam into the river to find the rattan bag was the one who went into the water to set up the water mine. When the water mine exploded, it was on the left side of the pier (that is, the left side of the ferry's kitchen), piercing a huge hole, about four feet wide. Behind the ferry's kitchen was the women's cabin. Fortunately, the ferry had not yet departed at this time, so there were only a few people in the kitchen, such as boat companion Wang Sandi. Wang and others only suffered minor injuries to their hands and legs. At that time, the entire ship entered the water, and about 300 male and female passengers scrambled to get ashore, trampling on each other, and many were squeezed into the water. The Jinghai and Taiping sub-bureaus reported this and immediately led the bureau members and armed police to rush to the scene. They first closed the iron gate of the dock. The Tianji Public Security Bureau fire engine rushed to the scene and immediately ordered the firefighters and police to first rescue the male and female passengers and put them on the dock to wait, and sent police to monitor them in order to search them separately. The search was completed until about 4:00 AM, and no suspects were found. Then the iron gate was opened. As for the ferry, after being bombed, it gradually sank. Fortunately, the water there was shallow, and it only sank to the helm house on the deck, with the bow facing south and the stern facing north. The ferry has now hired several boats to start winding the ferry to facilitate the hospital also sent a corpse collection team, and took several small boats, drove to the bay stop point where the ferry was parked to collect corpses, but by 12 o'clock before, still have not found the bodies, according to the ferry inside the people, said, was injured about 10 people, but not very important, was squeezed into the water and drowned male and female passengers, at most but five people cloud (17th).</p>
<h3 id="e58">Restoration of Telecommunications Rights for the Eastern Railway to Original State <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The Communications Committee Presents Six Proposals</p>
<p>The Board of Supervisors Meeting on the 18th Yields No Results</p>
<p>An Associated Press dispatch from Harbin on the 18th reports that the Northeast Communications Committee entrusted Mo Teh-hui to present an opinion to the board of directors of the Eastern Railway regarding the restoration of telecommunications rights. Apart from the Communications Committee's concession to allow the handover for the restoration of the telecommunications rights to their original state, the opinion includes six items: 1) A contract for paid interconnection between the railway's telegraph and local telegraph services should be established, with the Chinese telegraph bureau paying the railway bureau for interconnection fees, thereby canceling the previous contract where China entrusted the Eastern Railway with the rights to issue telegrams. 2) China is permitted to establish its own telegraph bureau between the A and B telegraph offices of the railway to send and receive commercial telegrams. Even if China cannot implement this immediately, the right is reserved for the future and remains permanently valid. 3) China can set up telegraph bureaus on both sides of the border at Manchuria and Suifenhe. Outgoing telegrams from the Eastern Railway must take the most economical route and be released after inspection. Even if China cannot implement this immediately, the right is reserved for the future and remains permanently valid. 4) All telegraph account balances during the Eastern Railway's period of occupation must be thoroughly investigated by officials dispatched by the Chinese telecommunications authorities, and any surplus must be returned to China. 5) The number of Chinese and Russian personnel in the telecommunications department and telegraph offices must be equal. The telegraph trainees currently recruited by the Chinese telegraph bureau must be given priority in filling vacancies. 6) The telecommunications rights conference must be convened no later than one month after the return of assets.</p>
<p>At 1 a.m. on the 18th, a joint meeting of the directors and supervisors of the Eastern Railway was held to discuss this issue. Chinese and Russian directors and supervisors attended in full. Previously, at the directors' regular meeting on the 17th, both sides had exchanged views on this matter and had some discussions on the method for restoring the telecommunications rights to their original state, but no decision was made. At the meeting on the 18th, the primary issue of handover was first decided to be implemented on the 20th to restore the original state. Subsequently, Mo Teh-hui presented the Communications Committee's opinions and requested discussion. The Russian supervisors and directors did not fully agree with the three items: setting up telegraph bureaus in Manchuria and Suifenhe, China establishing telegraph bureaus between the A and B telegraph offices, and investigating the telegraph fee accounts. As these were not proposals at the time, both sides avoided debate. Finally, the matter was reserved for discussion at the regular meeting on the 21st. On the Communications Committee's side, instructions were recently received from the central government that no concessions would be made on matters of sovereignty under any circumstances. However, whether or not the telecommunications rights conference would be convened would depend on the Russian side's attitude towards the Communications Committee's six proposals. Li Deyan, Deputy Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department, is still waiting for news in Harbin regarding this matter. However, now that the restoration to the original state has been achieved, the Russian side seems to have no intention of convening the conference.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Work of the Yangtze River Management Committee <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Yangtze River originates from the Min Mountains, spanning over 9,000 li. All areas along its basin are important towns. However, in recent years, turbulent floods and slow sediment accumulation have obstructed navigation channels and inundated farmland, causing losses for farmers, merchants, and the people, the magnitude of which is difficult to calculate. Li Zhonggong of the Ministry of Communications' Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee, recognizing this issue, had already planned and completed the surveying of the entire river to prepare for active dredging. Now, in the spirit of the era of material construction, every effort should be made to progress rapidly to achieve the goals. Therefore, he ordered Kong Xiangrong, the Chief of the General Affairs Department, and Song Xishang, the Chief of the Engineering Department, to draft various plans to complete surveying, prepare for construction, and concentrate efforts to improve internal affairs, so that rectification can proceed smoothly and the results can be remarkable in the future, setting a precedent for water conservancy throughout the country.</p>
<p>Complete the Measurement of the First Major Section of Silt Within a Deadline: The Yangtze River from Wusong to Hankou is divided into the first major section. During the winter and spring when the water level drops and the river dries up, the eleven most silted and navigation-obstructing locations are Chongwen Island, Taizi Islet, Yaojia Island, Zhangjia Island, Jiangjia Island, Liang Island, Huguang Sandbar, Daijia Island, Luo Island, Yadan Island, and Desheng Island. Other locations such as Heisha Island, Xinzhou, Dongliu Waterway, Yejia Island, and Madang are also showing a trend of increasing siltation. Since expanding the surveying team last year, the Yangtze River Management Committee has been focusing on surveying. Now, a deadline has been set for completing all surveys by the summer of this year to proceed with dredging projects. Survey team members are also restricted from taking leave arbitrarily and are required to work actively to avoid wasting time and to complete the surveying plan as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Preparing the Jing River Project in Hubei: The Jing River basin in Hubei Province has suffered from river water backflow disasters for many years. The disaster-stricken area in counties such as Jiayu covers 61 square kilometers, or approximately 91,500 acres. Farmers fear the unpredictability of floods and the uncertainty of harvests, often abandoning their land and not daring to plant crops. Weeds and desolate smoke fill the landscape. Every year when floods approach, people leave their homes together, and the magnitude of the losses is truly unbearable. Song Xishang, Chief of the Engineering Department of the Yangtze River Management Committee, drafted a plan for the Jing River Management Project in Hubei, which was submitted by the Ministry of Communications to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. After the implementation of this plan, not only can the harm of river water backflow be eliminated, but the swampy land can also be transformed into fertile soil. It is estimated that the annual benefits will include a land value of over 39 million yuan and an agricultural output income of over 3.9 million yuan per year. The convenience of transportation will also bring significant benefits. Li Zhonggong, the Chairman of the Committee, is currently contacting the central government and the Hubei Provincial Government separately to proceed with implementation and has ordered the General Engineering and Engineering Departments of the Committee to convene meetings to discuss fundraising methods and construction steps. Song Xishang, the Chief of the Engineering Department of the Committee, is currently planning all projects and is extremely busy.</p>
<p>Expanding the Committee's Headquarters and Centralizing Operations: The Committee originally had an office in Shanghai, where all operations were overseen by the Chief Surveying Engineer, an American named Stowe. However, the mailing of drawings and the receipt of instructions for engineering plans were inconvenient. Therefore, for the sake of centralizing operations, Li Zhonggong, the Chairman of the Yangtze River Management Committee, ordered the General Engineering and Engineering Departments to move the Shanghai office to the Beijing headquarters at the beginning of this month, renting additional rooms to expand office space. He also transferred capable personnel stationed in Shanghai, such as Jia Xiangtuo, Zhao Duanyuan, Liu Dazheng, and Zhang Jingyi, to the General Engineering and Engineering Departments to serve and work. It is reported that additional technical specialists will be recruited to prepare for surveying and construction arrangements.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Reorganization of the Mongolian Banner Military System in Suiyuan Province <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Suiyuan reports that the thirteen banners of the Ulanqab and Ih Ju leagues each have Mongolian guerrilla units, all of which are cavalry, brave and skilled in battle, and still retain the spirit of nomadic peoples. They are quite effective in protecting the local area and suppressing bandits and rebels. However, their organization is too unsystematic, and their firearms are mostly outdated and lacking. The provincial government and the garrison headquarters both believe that there is a need for reorganization. With prior approval, these units have been reorganized into Mongolian Banner Security Forces, with the garrison commander responsible for handling the matter. The league heads of both leagues have been appointed as commanders of their respective league's security forces, both under the command and supervision of the garrison commander, to achieve unification. The battalion commanders of each banner are concurrently filled by the Jasags of each banner to facilitate deployment. Recent surveys indicate that the Jungar Banner of the Ih Ju League can field 600 cavalrymen, while the Darat Banner, Etok Banner, and Ushing Banner can each field 300 men. The County Prince Banner and Hanggin Banner can each field 200 men, and the Jasag Banner can field 100 men. The Darkhan Banner of the Ulanqab League can field 400 cavalrymen, the Siziwang Banner can field 300 men, the Urad Front Banner can field 300 men, the Central Banner can field 500 men, the Rear Banner can field 200 men, and the Maoming'an Banner can field 100 men. In total, the thirteen banners can field 3,800 men, a force that cannot be considered insignificant. If these forces can be effectively reorganized, they will not only provide local security but also contribute to national defense. It is reported that the garrison headquarters has drafted a general plan for reorganization, which will likely be implemented soon. The content of the plan is quite detailed regarding organization, uniforms, firearms, salaries, and training, and it is mostly tailored to the circumstances of the Mongolian banners. The league heads of both leagues have already received their appointment certificates, and the banners are clamoring for the replenishment of firearms and ammunition. Future results can be confidently predicted. The outline of the plan is recorded below.</p>
<p>General Plan for Reorganizing Mongolian Troops: 1) Purpose: An investigation reveals that the Mongolian troops are scattered across various banners and lack education. In peacetime, they each seek their own livelihood, and in times of trouble, they fight individually. They lack a unified spirit and a command system. It is estimated that the two leagues and thirteen banners have no fewer than 3,000 to 4,000 fully equipped men. If they can be reorganized and trained, they can easily be transformed into elite troops. Moreover, the Suiyuan region is a mixed area of Han and Mongol peoples, and bandits emerge endlessly. To fundamentally eradicate them, it is essential for Han and Mongol peoples to unite to achieve effective results. For the sake of improvement and reorganization, it is proposed to revise the organizational regulations, organize into teams according to the banners, and add training to unite the spirit and unify actions, so that they can be transformed into disciplined and systematic troops, in order to suppress banditry and consolidate border defense. 2) Name: All Mongolian troops reorganized from the banners of the Ulanqab and Ih Ju leagues will be named Mongolian Banner Security Forces. 3) Organization: An investigation reveals that the current number of Mongolian troops in each banner of the Ulanqab and Ih Ju leagues varies from just over one hundred to one thousand. In order to implement a policy of elite troops, a moderate organization is adopted, so that each banner can be organized according to its actual situation, without exceeding the original quota of soldiers, and it is easy to implement. Each banner sets up one or several companies according to the situation, with the princes of each banner concurrently serving as company commanders, referred to as the Nth Company of the Security Force of a certain banner. Each company is composed of four platoons, with numbers attached such as the First Platoon and the Second Platoon. The number of platoons within each company can also be reduced according to the circumstances of each banner, but the number must not be reduced to less than two platoons. Each platoon is composed of three squads, each with one squad leader and seven Mongolian soldiers, numbered in order from the First Squad to the Twelfth Squad for the entire company. If a banner has more than two companies, they will be organized into a battalion, with a battalion commander in charge, referred to as the Nth Battalion of the Security Force of a certain banner, with the dukes of each banner concurrently serving as battalion commanders. The position of company commander in the battalion will be filled by military officers, but each battalion must not exceed three companies. The battalions and companies within each league will each be attached with numbers in order, such as the First Battalion, the Second Battalion, the First Company, and the Second Company. Each league will set up a commander above the battalions and companies, referred to as the Commander of the Mongolian Banner Security Force of the Ulanqab League and the Commander of the Mongolian Banner Security Force of the Ih Ju League, with the league heads concurrently serving as commanders. 4) System: The battalion commanders of each banner or the company commanders concurrently held by the princes are directly subordinate to the commander of the security force of their respective league. The company commanders within each battalion are directly subordinate to their battalion commander, and the platoon leaders within each company are directly subordinate to their company commander, following a layer-by-layer control. The commanders of the security forces of each league are directly subordinate to the Suiyuan Region Garrison Commander. Their subordinate units, regarding organization, education, and the deployment of troops, are under the command and control of the garrison commander. However, regarding their internal affairs, such as financial management, sanitation, personnel transfers, supplements, and the temporary deployment of troops for bandit suppression within each banner, they can handle them on one hand and report to the garrison commander on the other. 5) Uniforms: Uniforms are uniformly gray, prepared by the garrison headquarters, deducted from salaries, or made by themselves according to the style. 6) Firearms and Ammunition: First, each banner will be ordered to report the number and type of firearms and ammunition. Those with damaged firearms will be requested by the garrison headquarters to the commander-in-chief for replenishment. Ammunition will also be requested by the garrison headquarters for replenishment when necessary. 7) Salaries: Salaries will be handled according to the regulations in the salary table. However, the circumstances of each banner are different and can be increased or decreased appropriately according to the conditions of their respective banners, but they must be reported to the garrison headquarters at any time. 8) Training: In addition to each team making every effort to find military personnel who are proficient in both Han and Mongolian languages to serve as officers for training, each banner will select one official to study in the troops and agencies designated by the garrison headquarters. Upon completion, they will return to their banner to reorganize and train. 9) Flags and Armbands: The flags will be red and white side by side, with the Blue Sky with a White Sun emblem attached to the top. The size will imitate the flags used by the army, with the team number written on it, such as the Nth Battalion or Nth Company of the Mongolian Banner Security Force of a certain league. The armbands will be white with a red border, with the Blue Sky with a White Sun attached to the center, with the soldier's name and the number of the platoon in his company, and the number of the banner and team, all indicated in both Han and Mongolian languages. 10) Communication: Communication between Han and Mongolian troops is extremely important when cooperating in bandit suppression. In addition to temporarily stipulating identification flags and identification badges for communication, each Mongolian Banner Security Force must send buglers to designated agencies to learn the communication code. In addition to officers, each team must have at least two or three Mongolian soldiers who can speak Chinese for communication. 11) If there are any omissions or amendments to this outline, they may be amended at any time and reported to the Commander-in-Chief for record. 12) This outline will be implemented from the date it is submitted for approval (March 10).</p>

<p>A dispatch from Shantou reports that the King of Siam, Rama VII, held his coronation ceremony on the 25th of last month. From the 24th onwards, the entire city had a three-day holiday. Chinese stores and schools were also ordered to close. A friend returned from Siam and described the recent grand occasion in Bangkok. According to him, the King of Siam went to Ratchasima on March 1st to inspect the field exercises of the Second Division. On that day, at dawn, he departed via the northern route by car. In the afternoon, he arrived at Ratchasima. On the 2nd, he inspected various barracks and reviewed the night exercises of the Third Division in the evening. On the 3rd, he reviewed the combined exercises of the Fourth Division on horseback. In the afternoon, he inspected the administrative agencies in various locations in Korat and participated in the opening ceremony of the Lam Takhong River. On the 4th, he departed by car in the morning and transferred to a carriage to review the combat exercises of the Third Division. The grand occasion was unprecedented in the country. News reporters and film experts from various countries all followed to take photos. Unfortunately, the Chinese news media did not pay much attention. Since King Rama VII is working hard to strengthen the country, his military preparations are worthy of attention. His scheduled itinerary included: inspecting the combat exercises of the Fourth Division on the morning of the 5th; visiting Wat Pa Nom Wan Temple on the 6th; reviewing the field exercises of the Second Division on the 7th, 8th, and 9th; returning south to Kong to inspect the installation of train tracks on the 10th; visiting the airfield on the 11th to review air force flights and test the new tactics of aerial bombing; reviewing all army drills in the afternoon and holding a banquet in the evening; and returning to Bangkok from Ratchasima Province on the 12th.

<h3 id="e64">Establishment of Petition Boxes in Various Counties of Liaoning Province <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Shenyang reports that Chen Wenxue, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, proposed at an administrative conference held with the county magistrates at the end of last year that petition boxes be set up in the street markets of each county to allow people to freely report issues and promote freedom of speech. Tian Qinglan, the magistrate of Zhangwu County, also proposed a plan to install petition boxes for the public. A resolution was passed, and the Department of Civil Affairs drafted the scope and rules for submission, which were then circulated for compliance. Now, the Department of Civil Affairs, considering that both the petition boxes proposed by the department and the petition boxes for the public proposed by the magistrate of Zhangwu County are intended to allow people to express their opinions and broaden avenues for speech, has decided to cancel the name "petition boxes" and uniformly name them "petition boxes" to match the reality. It has also drafted twelve rules for the petition boxes, which have been submitted to the provincial government for approval and circulated to the counties for compliance, to seek understanding of public grievances. The rules are as follows: 1) The public is allowed to submit written petitions at any time to report local tyrants, evil gentry, bandits, corrupt officials who harm the local community, for investigation and handling. 2) The public is allowed to submit written petitions at any time to suggest matters that should be developed or reformed in county administration, for adoption. 3) The submitted petitions must include the real name and address of the submitter and be accompanied by a guarantee to be valid. 4) The petitions do not have to follow a specific format, but the words must be clear and easy to understand. 5) The county magistrate must carefully investigate and handle the defendants and the matters stated in the petitions. The defendants must not be arrested or imprisoned without solid evidence. 6) The county magistrate must strictly keep the name of the submitter confidential, but if the reported matters are found to be maliciously false accusations, the case may be summoned for verification and punishment. 7) The petition box is located outside the county government gate, in a place convenient for the public to access. 8) The box is made of wood, and the size is determined by each county itself, but it must have a flat hole on top and a door on the side for opening and submission. 9) The box door is locked, and the key is kept by the county magistrate. 10) The county magistrate must personally open the box once a day and immediately investigate and handle any submitted petitions. 11) These rules must be written on a wooden sign and hung on the side of the box for public awareness. 12) These rules will be implemented from the date of promulgation.

<h3 id="e65">Special Salt Fields Discovered in Lushun <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Most Suitable for Industrial Soda</p>
<p>World News Agency reports that Professor Fanze Tsuneya of the Lushun Japanese Institute of Technology is currently engaged in research on industrial soda. He says that a few years ago, he accidentally discovered that a part of the salt fields in Lushun-Dalian is different from ordinary salt fields, with a reddish color. After research, it was determined that its concentration is quite high. The salt content of ordinary salt fields is on average 78%, while this salt field exceeds 95%. It is most excellent for industrial soda, which is a raw material for glass manufacturing. He has been researching for two years as to why this special salt field was formed and has recently discovered the reason: it is due to the burial of shellfish and algae in the ground, which decomposes and promotes the crystallization of this higher concentration. This special salt field is indeed very complete for industrial soda and is more economical than conventional soda. Various glass companies have placed orders. However, the production area is limited to a part of the Lushun salt fields, and the annual production is only 4,000 to 5,000 tons, which will be exhausted in a few years. With the help of the Kwantung Government, test salt fields have been set up in both the Goto and Lushun areas, with the aim of producing the same salt as the special salt fields. After repeated research, it is known that although the special salt fields in Lushun are a natural process, the same salt can be expected to be produced artificially. The results of the tests at the end of August last year will soon be revealed, and success is expected. Local news.</p>

<p>Reorganization of the Municipal Office: The Wuxi Municipal Preparatory Office of the Municipal Commission has been established for eight months since its establishment last autumn. The preparatory period has long expired. Now, an electric order was received from the Department of Civil Affairs stating that since the Municipal Organization Law has not yet been promulgated, the originally established Municipal Preparatory Office should be concluded and stopped. On the other hand, seven to nine people with rich experience and good reputation in the local area should be selected to organize a municipal committee to be responsible for handling municipal affairs. Director Sun believes that the organization of the municipal committee is extremely important and specially proposed the 33rd office meeting. It was decided that the Municipal Preparatory Office would be uniformly concluded by the end of March. The Municipal Office is now preparing for the handover. Yesterday afternoon, the Municipal Committee held its fourth meeting at the Municipal Office to discuss how to organize the municipal committee in accordance with the order of the department. After discussion, it was decided to submit a report to the provincial department for review.</p>

<p>North Township Bandits Shoot Two People: The remaining associates of Wan Gou Da Bao and Lao Hu, bandit leaders already executed in the north township of Wu Yi, have been secretly active recently, plotting revenge. They intended to kill workers at the Fourth District Public Office. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Lu Kuang, an assistant at the office, accompanied by five members of the Longhutang police squad, armed and in tow, planned to go to his home in Xiaoxinqiao. On the way, while passing through the Chashiqiao area, they suddenly discovered five bandits. They first shined a flashlight at them, and then opened fire. The police squad returned fire. Fortunately, Lu Kuang hid behind them. Bandit bullets hit passersby Fan Guiqing in his left and dark big toes. Fan was hit by four bullets in his right leg and three in his left. The left one then attempted to escape by wading across the river. He was further injured in the water and may be in mortal danger.</p>
<p>Committee Members from the Ministry of Judicial Administration Leave Changzhou: The Ministry of Judicial Administration ordered Section Chief Zhang Yuhai and staff member Wang Qufei to come to Changzhou to investigate the situation after the establishment of the county court.

<p>Bandits Rampant in the Eastern Township: Bandits have recently been openly active in the Yu Dong, Yu Xi, and San Yi districts of the eastern township, burning, looting, and killing with great ferocity. On the night of the 21st, a group of bandits suddenly attacked the Gongsi, Zhongba, and Siyangba areas, seizing all the firearms, over two hundred pieces, from the third squad of the county police team and the militia of the industrial team. They also kidnapped many people from Nanfu. Squad leader Xu Guanxiong fled back to Tongcheng on the 22nd. The situation is serious due to this incident. The provincial police squad's machine gun team rushed back to suppress them. The special police team stationed at the gate and the merchant corps in the city are blocking the routes. The naval fleet stationed at the Lujing Port took the defense of Tongcheng seriously. Under the command of the Yingrui warship captain Lin Yuanquan, a landing party of naval infantry was stationed in vacant rooms of the General Chamber of Commerce to take charge of security. A temporary curfew has been declared throughout the county. The County Court Thoroughly Investigates the Opium Trafficking Case: The Nantong County Court has recently discovered that opium dens are numerous within its jurisdiction, with private sales and trafficking rampant. A large amount of opium is imported and sold daily to Taixing, Rugao and other counties. There are also cases of bribery of government officials to allow passage. President Dong and Prosecutor Zhu are thoroughly investigating the matter and have issued a notice allowing people to report such cases.</p>

<p>Commercial Reorganization Association Submits Petition to the Province for Explanation: The county government, acting on orders to abolish local commercial and civil coordination associations, immediately instructed the association to comply and ordered the county chamber of commerce to take over. It is learned that the Commercial Reorganization Association believes that the county chamber of commerce has not legally organized according to the Law on Industrial and Commercial Guilds, and has specially submitted petitions to the Provincial Commercial Reorganization Association and the county party headquarters, respectively, to request instructions.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Grain Donation and Release: Rice merchant Chen Jingui, entrusted by Nantong Dada Company and others, purchased 1,000 shi of white rice from Wuxi in the name of providing relief to the people. 500 shi passed through Jiangyin, and had already passed Huangtiangang Port. Due to the bill of lading, it was detained by the county, and the Public Security Bureau and the Chamber of Commerce were ordered to investigate. Regarding the donation issue, the county government also ordered the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate. Chen Jingui's passport was issued by Nantong County on February 16th, stating 500 shi. The freight note was issued by Wuxi Chang Yutai on March 10th, totaling 200 shi of white yuan rice at 14 yuan, 1 jiao and 4 fen per shi, and 80 shi of white geng rice at 14 yuan, 7 jiao and 6 fen per shi, totaling 4,687 yuan. There was also a tax ticket from the Wuxi Huangbudun Tax Office, totaling 180 shi of white geng rice, with a total tax of 9 yuan. The General Bureau ordered the North Outer Branch Bureau to investigate and handle the matter yesterday. The Pingbao reported on the 22nd that the matter of detaining grain and releasing it after donation was ordered to be thoroughly investigated by the Public Security Bureau to see if there was any extortion. It should not be difficult to get to the bottom of this. According to insiders, this rice was indeed trafficked by Pan Jintai, and Chen Jingui is Pan's brother-in-law. Pan is the leader of the net boat gang and has repeatedly used passports to traffic rice overseas, often exporting from Changshu or Xutang. Now, due to other obstacles, he is taking the route through Huangtiangang Port to Nantong, and then transferring it to Ningbo fishing boats for overseas export. The matter of paying donations when passing through Huang Nan Port this time is unknown, but the black money used has indeed reached several hundred yuan. The tax is handled by rice brokers Wu A Quan, Sheng Xiaofeng, and Wang Shirong. However, since it is claimed to be providing relief to the people, why is it necessary to privately pay black money? This is also a question worth studying. According to the above records, the rice merchants paid dock donations, which is not without reason.</p>

<p>Procuring Saigon Rice for Famine Relief: The harvest in our county last winter was very poor, and the spring famine this year is even more severe, causing the risk of starvation in various villages. It is heard that a large amount of Saigon rice has arrived in Shanghai. The county government and the Chamber of Commerce have already taken measures to purchase some through the Jianghai Customs to set up a bureau for price controls. It is heard that the Daqiaoshi Chamber of Commerce is also purchasing 3,000 shi in the same way, transporting it to the city six times from the Yangtze River to provide relief.</p>
<p>Zhenqing Salt Shao Boat Robbery Case: The Zai Shengchang boat, which travels between Zhenjiang and Qingjiang, left Zhenjiang with the Run Tong and Gui boats on the evening of the 21st. After boarding passengers, it arrived in Yangzhou at around 1 a.m. on the 22nd. It sailed to Wutaishan and suddenly encountered a bandit boat carrying more than ten bandits. They opened fire and ordered the boat to stop, boarded the boat, and searched and robbed passengers of their clothing, foreign jewelry, and belongings. They then returned to their small boat and left. The robbed Run Tong and Gui boats are still parked at the scene of the incident, and the county government has been notified to investigate. It is also learned that the Dada Yanshao class Yang boat, towing the Flying Eagle boat, was traveling from Yan to Shao the day before when it reached the Qiushuge area in Lvze Lake, 30 li from Shao. Dozens of bandits, riding in small boats, swarmed aboard, robbing over a thousand yuan in cash. Male and female passengers were all searched, and foreign jewelry was looted. Even the crotches of the female passengers were searched. Residents on both banks heard the alarm and beat gongs, but the bandits had already looted to their hearts' content and left.</p>
<p>Shaobozhen Rice Shop Robbed: At 1 a.m. on the 21st, eight bandits, holding sunflower wooden sticks, dug a hole and crowded into the Yang Guangtai rice shop on Shaobozhen Street. Speaking with a Yanfu accent, they demanded 400 yuan in cash from the owner. There were no men in the shop, so the women knelt down and begged. The bandits searched and looted all the clothing and jewelry, opened the main door, and left.</p>

<p>A family of eight relied solely on the meager income from over ten mu of ancestral land for their livelihood. Due to the famine last year, they harvested nothing. In addition, rice and firewood have become increasingly expensive recently, making their daily diet even more difficult. The other day, they pawned their worn-out cotton robe for over two thousand wen to buy several sheng of rice in Jieshou. Because they were short two copper coins, the rice shop refused to give them the rice. Zhang returned home in anger, bought several jin of flour and a package of arsenic, mixed it into the flour, and told his family to make cakes to fill their hunger. After the whole family ate, they died one after another. It is truly tragic.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Rising Daily: Rice prices in the county are rising daily because the rice mills have little inventory and lack sources. Top-quality rice is 21 yuan per dan, medium-quality rice is 20 yuan and 4 jiao, and low-quality rice is 20 yuan. It is said that there is still a tendency to see higher prices.</p>

<p>Recent Disturbances at Two Provincial Schools: It is heard that Wang Zhongqi, the principal of Huai'an Middle School, has resigned and been approved. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education appointed Chen Shishen to take over, but the teachers and students of the entire school were dissatisfied and went on strike on the 15th. It is learned that Chen formally took over on the 18th, and former principal Wang also plans to leave. However, the school has not yet resumed classes, although the director of studies, Xia Yi, is doing his best to maintain order and prepare to resume classes today (20th), but to no avail. In addition, seven of the school's former teachers, Wu Fuzhi (drawing), Su Youzhang (English), Zeng Pinren, Tang Weizhou (both Chinese), Hang Haichuan (history and geography), Hua Rucheng (biology), and Xu Gongwei (mathematics and physics), have also expressed their intention to leave with former principal Wang. It is difficult to predict how this will be resolved in the future. In addition, at Huaiyin Agricultural School, students previously opposed the make-up examinations for the winter vacation. Provincial supervisor Cao Shutian telegraphed the department for instructions and received a reply ordering the expulsion of the striking students. If all the students strike, they will all be expelled. If there is any resistance, the local authorities will be asked to assist. Upon receiving this news, the students of the school obeyed the department's orders and took the examinations as scheduled. The disturbance was safely resolved.</p>
<p>New Names Selected for Siyang City Gates: Siyang County Magistrate Ha Fusheng previously announced a solicitation for names for the four city gates. The solicitation period ended on the 15th. The county government convened various agencies to publicly select names, with the name with the most identical entries being considered suitable. It is calculated that on that day, more than ten people who submitted entries were inspected, and more than forty votes were cast. As a result, Gu Daoxuan's proposed name (Pointing to the Sun) for the east gate was considered suitable, Chen Shengru's proposed name (Mirror Lake) for the south gate was considered suitable, and Ni Yangke's proposed names (Peach Garden) and (Approaching the Canal) for the west gate and north gate were considered suitable.</p>

<p>The Remaining Bandits of the Pan Gang are Rampant: Fisherman Li of the Piancha Dongyang Port fled back from the bandit den yesterday. According to him, after the bandits of the Pan Gang were suppressed, the remaining members of the Xue Shen Guan Xi joined forces with Yuan Zhaorui, gathering more than 500 people with more than 40 boats, over 200 rifles, many box cannons, six handheld machine guns, and six or seven steel and bronze cannons. They rob cargo ships at sea, and buy local thugs to act as spies, land to kidnap people, and if the ransom is not paid for a long time, the men are forced into labor, the women are raped, or they are shot. Their daily necessities are purchased by local thugs, and bullets and other items are delivered by Ningbo sand boats.</p>

<p>The Origin of the Rumor of Another Robbery in Luxu: At 3 p.m. on the 22nd, it was rumored in Luxu Town, Wu that it had been robbed again by lake bandits. A detailed investigation revealed that it was the steamer from Luli to Jiashan that saw the security corps at Lu Nan Gate that day sounding the whistle to gather, armed with real bullets, and leaving South Gate. After the boat traveled a mile, the sound of gunfire was very intense, closely resembling both sides opening fire. The sound lasted longer and further north, so it was speculated that the bandits were robbing Luxu. However, after inquiring to Xiazhen Temple, there was no definite news. In addition, Luxu has no telephone communication. Therefore, the steamer from Jiashan to Luxu only went as far as Xiazhen Temple. News was silent and could not be explored.</p>

They then retreated to the Henggang East area to rest and celebrate, claiming that the quick-firing rifles robbed in Yangjiabin were of great profit. They ordered that all fourteen hostages be redeemed and sent back. However, four hostages were taken by a smaller gang and are near Fengjing, so they have not yet returned. The ten hostages were each treated to wine and food and were safely released. The above news was told by the returned hostages. Qidun Kidnapping Case: Chen Muguan of Xitang Qidun was kidnapped by bandits last night, tortured with a cangue, and agreed to pay 250 yuan for his life.

<p>The opening of the Huázhōng Games on the morning of the 19th, as well as the results of various track and field events, were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The following is a record of the afternoon events of the conference on the 19th. The afternoon of the 19th was entirely devoted to ball games. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Tennis: Hàn vs. Wǎn: Hàn Wins</p>
<p>In the morning, only two singles matches were played between Hàn and Wǎn. Wǎn and Hàn each won one match, so the finals were held in the afternoon. As a result, Hàn won. Only one doubles match was played between Hàn and Wǎn in tennis. The result of the afternoon game was also a win for Hàn.</p>
<p>Basketball: Hàn vs. Xiāng (Men): Hàn Wins; Gàn vs. Wǎn (Women): Wǎn Wins</p>
<p>As a result of the men's and women's basketball games between Hàn and Xiāng, Hàn won. In the women's basketball game between Gàn and Wǎn, Wǎn was already at a disadvantage in the first half. The representatives of Wǎn province were Wǎn No. 2 Girls' Middle School, which is the most capable team among the women's basketball teams in Wǎn province. In the second half, the Wǎn team tried its best to compete and managed to turn defeat into victory. The result was a score of 20 to 14, and Wǎn won. The Wǎn team's passing was quick, scoring two consecutive goals in one minute. No wonder the applause was thunderous. The finals will be held with Xiāng in the next few days. The victory in the future is still unknown, but the Wǎn team is indeed confident.</p>
<p>Volleyball: Xiāng vs. È (Women): Xiāng Wins; Gàn vs. È (Men): Gàn Wins</p>
<p>In the women's volleyball game between Xiāng and È, the result was 2-0, and Xiāng won. In the women's volleyball game between Gàn and È, Gàn won.</p>
<p>Football: Xiāng vs. È (Men): È Wins</p>
<p>In the soccer match between Xiāng and È, È won with a score of 4-0.</p>
<p>Swimming Postponed</p>
<p>The swimming preliminaries were originally scheduled to be held at 3:00 p.m. on the 19th, but due to insufficient water in the swimming pool, it will not be available until the afternoon of the 20th. Therefore, there was no swimming competition on the afternoon of the 19th.</p>
<p>Total Scores for Two Days</p>
<p>The total scores for the track and field competitions on the 18th and 19th are calculated as follows: Xiāng men: 63.2 points; women: 12 points. Gàn men: 38.3 points; women: 0 points. È men: 25 points; women: 10 points. Wǎn men: 16.2 points; women: 11 points. Hàn men: 0.2 points; women: did not participate.</p>
<p>Supplementary Record of Results</p>
<p>The women's eight-pound shot put, held on the morning of the 18th, did not have its results available at the time. The following is the supplement. The names have already been detailed in yesterday's draft and will not be recorded again. Women's 8-pound shot put final: 7.27 meters.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Detailed Report of the Third Day <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The 20th was the third day of the Huázhōng Games. On this day, the weather was clear and refreshing, and the spring breeze was warm. There were more spectators than yesterday, about 20,000 or more. The morning was for track and field events and the men's and women's tennis matches between Xiāng and Gàn. The afternoon was entirely for ball games. The following is a record of the situation:</p>
<p>Swimming Rescheduled Again</p>
<p>The swimming event was originally scheduled to be held on the afternoon of the 19th, but was changed to this afternoon due to the swimming pool not being filled with water. However, the water was still not full today and has been changed to the morning of the 21st. Because the pool is newly built, it has a very strong water absorption capacity. It takes a long time and consumes a lot of energy to pump water with a hand-cranked water pump. It is expected that it will be available tomorrow.</p>
<p>Track and Field Results</p>
<p>The results of the track and field finals on the morning of the 20th are recorded below: Javelin Final: Hé Yìnhuán (Xiāng), Yáng Fāng (Xiāng), Zhào Rùnjí (Xiāng), Huáng Wényì (È), 41.8 meters.</p>

The finals were held again in the afternoon. In the women's group, Xiāng won both times. As a result, victory went to Xiāng. They will play against other provinces in the final in the next few days. The situation of the ball games in the afternoon:</p>
<p>The First Prize (Silver Pagoda) for the Overall Score was Made. The Preparatory Office spent 180 taels of silver to customize a large pagoda, the shape of which imitated the Zhènfēng Pagoda outside the East Gate of Ānqìng. It has been completed today and displayed on the prize platform, which is very beautiful.</p>

<p>Today (21st) is the fourth day after the opening of the Huázhōng Games. It was drizzling last night, and those who like to watch sports events were quite worried that it would rain today. Fortunately, the weather was beautiful, and the sun shone brightly this morning. The event was not diminished because of this, and the weather was warmer than yesterday, which made it more suitable for swimming. First, I will record the opening situation this morning:</p>
<p>Track and Field Completed</p>
<p>The track and field competition was completed yesterday afternoon (20th). At this time, the conference separated the all-around sports from track and field as two championships. Therefore, the scores for the all-around sports should not be included in the track and field competition.

<p>The women's tennis team consisted of Xiāng versus Wǎn for the final. As a result, Xiāng won 3-0. The Xiāng team had defeated the Gàn team, and they were even more energized by the victory in the war against Wǎn. The Wǎn team was no match for them.</p>
<p>Volleyball</p>
<p>The women's volleyball final was held on the afternoon of the 20th. As a result, Xiāng won. The men's volleyball team was a final between Hàn and Xiāng.

<p>The Inter-Class Track and Field Competition of Jiaotong University in Xújiāhuì was held in the school's new sports field the day before yesterday. The various classes participated enthusiastically. As a result, the Class of 1931 (Junior) scored 60 points and won the championship. It is also heard that the school will hold the All-School Sports Meet on the 28th, and representatives from the schools can also join.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Record of the First Day Shanxi Sports Meet <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>Tàiyuán, 10th: The Shanxi Provincial Games, which had been in preparation for a long time, officially opened at 9:00 a.m. on the 11th at the Little Five Platforms, where the North China ball game competition was held last year. More than 40 schools participated. The first day was basketball and tennis, which were held in five locations: Little Five Platforms, YMCA, and Fàzhuān, Shāngzhuān, and No. 1 Middle School. The 11th was the track and field preliminaries, and the 12th morning was suspended for half a day due to the death anniversary of the Prime Minister. In the afternoon, the finals were still held at the original site. The venue layout was extremely magnificent, surrounded by railings, and a lecture platform was built in the west. On both sides of the platform, the left was the dressing room for male team members, and the right was the dressing room for female team members. Above the venue, small flags of the Party and the country were hung, and a line was drawn long, fluttering and flying without restriction, looking like a long rainbow in the sky. From 8:00 a.m., the athletes and visitors arrived one after another. By 9:00 a.m., it was already crowded. Shāng Qǐyǔ, chairman of the provincial government, presided over the opening ceremony. After the rituals were completed, the chairman delivered a speech, which roughly stated: "Comrades, students, today the Shanxi Provincial Games are held to serve as a preliminary for participating in the Hángzhōu National Games. You will go to Hángzhōu to compete. The quality of your sports depends on your skills. The most important thing is to abide by the rules. People in other provinces used to say that Shanxi's sports were childish, but that's not necessarily true. From the current point of view, there has been considerable progress in sports and education. As for the relationship between sports and life and the nation, you have done a lot of research on sports, so I won’t go into details. Now I will briefly describe the two points that should be paid attention to: (1) Sports and the country. To know whether a country is strong or not, first look at the health and weakness of its national physique. Those with a strong national physique will be able to do good things. On the contrary, no matter how profound their scientific knowledge or how vast their literary research, there are not many who can succeed. It can be seen that the relationship between sports and the country is not superficial. (2) Sports and hobbies. Various sports should be used to reform the bad habits of the nation, such as the British promotion of tennis and the American popularity of baseball. I hope you will do your best to promote various sports to eliminate all kinds of bad habits of the people of Jìn. The effects of this are even better than the law. It is comparable and even surpasses it," and so on. Then, referee Zhāng Wǔchéng reported the order of the sports events, followed by a parade of all the staff and athletes in the venue for one week, and the ceremony was completed. The competition began, and three planes flew from the northwest and hovered over the venue's airspace, making extremely low flights, tilting and tumbling, fluttering and agile. The sound of the plane engine and the sound of military music echoed each other, which was quite a spectacle. The number of male and female athletes participating was about 500 or more, and the number of students and visitors from various schools reached more than 10,000. The perimeter outside the venue was crowded, and the roots of the southeast and two cities were almost filled. The women's visitors mostly occupied the north of the venue, and there were many of them. Many military, government, and civilian officials also came to the meeting to guide. The results of the competitions in various schools were often quite remarkable. However, in the morning, there was a dispute between Yīshī and Chéngchéng over the issue of scoring, which caused the order to be disrupted and the spirit to be dissipated. This was indeed a fly in the ointment. The results of the preliminary rounds on the 10th are listed separately below:</p>

<p>My wife says the Wang family's sister-in-law from next door says her husband often gets up and walks around in his sleep. In reality, he doesn't even know it himself.</p>
<p>Husband: The poor man. That's the freest he gets all day. I wish I could be like that too.</p>
<p>Old Gentleman: Madam, do you have a son?</p>
<p>Woman: Yes, I have only one son.</p>
<p>Old Gentleman: Does he smoke?</p>
<p>Woman: He has never smoked a single cigarette.</p>
<p>Old Gentleman: That's excellent. There's poison in tobacco; it's best not to smoke. Does he often go to gambling dens or brothels?</p>
<p>Woman: He never leaves the house and goes to sleep early every night.</p>
<p>Old Gentleman: Madam, congratulations! Your son is truly a model youth. How old is he?</p>
<p>Woman: Only one year old.</p>
<p>Housewife (addressing the maid sternly): If you don't do your job properly, I'll hire someone else.</p>
<p>Maid: That would be wonderful. The workload here is too heavy; it should be divided between two people.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Spring News from the Lakeside <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>

<p>The spring breeze is warm, willows are green, and flowers are red. West Lake, known nationwide for its beauty, is graced by this natural embellishment, further enhancing its charm. In recent days, people in fine attire throng here, shoulder to shoulder, strolling among the Six Bridges and the Three Temples. They are all tourists from afar who have come to enjoy the spring. As a visitor myself, I will select and report the spring news to the readers.</p>
<p>The National Games, which caused a sensation, are about to open on April 1st. The Provincial Games have been underway for days. The athletes from various schools are full of energy, competing on the Meidong High Bridge. In particular, the female students are most excited and colorful. Entering the venue, those in gray shirts and black skirts account for nearly half the number. One only needs to hear the loudness of their cheering to imagine the intensity of the competition in the arena.</p>
<p>The local opera scene on the lake has been very quiet. This year, the Common Dance Stage has reorganized and strengthened its forces, hiring Xiao San Mazi, Li Donglai, and female performers such as He Yurong, Zhou Wenyan, and Zui Yuejuan. They are staging "The Legend of Flying Dragon" and various "Red Scholar" plays. Their appeal is still quite strong. Every day, the audience attendance is more than fifty or sixty percent. The West Lake Amusement Garden has hired female performers Lü Jinfen and the Three Peonies, staging the new play "Heavenly Rain of Flowers" with Gao Tingzan and others. The audience fills the venue to capacity, extremely crowded.</p>
<p>The lakeside hotels are all located in the New Market, making it inconvenient for tourists traveling to and from the lake by boat and carriage. Recently, someone has proposed opening the Xiling Hotel on the edge of Gushan Island, and preparations are actively underway. It is expected to open sometime in the height of spring. At that time, men and women who come to enjoy the spring can avoid a lot of travel fatigue.</p>
<p>After the closing of the Exposition, the local authorities, wishing to leave a permanent memento, specially built an Exposition Memorial Tower in the heart of the lake. The tower has three stories. Climbing the winding staircase, one can ascend to the top of the tower and see the entire lake. The beautiful scenery is like a painting, sufficient to refresh one's spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Record of the Web-Fingered Village in Spain <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Those of us who toil year after year, using our ten fingers to earn our living, often have a strange idea, regretting that we cannot add another hand, increase the number of fingers, to assist in our daily work. Although it may be a joke, it is also a common human sentiment. Recently, I heard that there is a village in Spain where people with webbed fingers gather, and this must be recorded.</p>
<p>In Spain, there is a small village called Podragón, located in the province of Madrid. It is surrounded by towering mountains and barren scenery. Its seclusion and remoteness are like the Peach Blossom Spring of Jin, with little contact with the outside world. A wide road cannot be found, and even a narrow path is not passable. Those who reside in this village, about fifty households, or more than 150 people, sustain themselves by farming. There is no involvement in industry, commerce, or scholarship. The village produces abundant stone, mostly of inferior quality, which is useless and hinders agricultural work. Therefore, without endless hard work, it is impossible to obtain coarse food and warm clothing. The only unique feature of the villagers is that they all have six fingers on each hand. The residents consider having more fingers to be a virtue, as they can assist in operations.</p>
<p>There was a farmer in the village who once joined the army, but after examining his physical condition, he was rejected because of his extra fingers. He was not satisfied and instead asked for an examination by a medical officer. Because he grew up in a village of web-fingered people, he was accustomed to seeing many fingers. If he happened to be outside the village, he would be surprised by the strangeness of having only five fingers. An old farmer in the village once told people the reason for the webbed fingers, saying that hundreds of years ago, webbed fingers were not common. Later, a man and a woman, both with webbed fingers, married. Their descendants all had webbed fingers. Passed down through generations, to this day, they all have six or seven fingers, without exception.</p>
<p>When Chinese people have extra fingers, they often give them the auspicious name of "Six-Fingered Elder." However, if they are weak, short, and small like a baby's, unable to hold things, they are like useless growths. The fingers of those who grow up in the web-fingered village are the opposite. Their strength is equal to the inherent five fingers. They can work side by side, which is also a rare story. The village has many stones, and farming relies on labor. Much depends on the fingers to assist. Is there a divine number existing among them?</p>
<h3 id="e110">A Record of the Night Banquet and Song at the Huanyun Tower <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Chunshu</p>
<p>Last autumn, I moved to Baiyun Stream. The stream is the most scenic in our county, and my residence is the Wang family's villa, also occupying the most scenic spot on Yun Stream. Famous scholars' pavilions surround it, and across the stream are Su Dongpo's Purple Vine Pavilion and Yun Nantian's Ouxiang Pavilion. The ruins still exist. Tang Runzhi's Spring Rain Painting Tower and Shi Ganfu's Yi Garden, with their flowers, trees, pavilions, and terraces, are all within sight. The stream turns east to Tangjiawan, a stream flowing between willow trees lining both banks. Next to it is the Confucius Temple. To the right overlooks the ancient Baiyun Ferry, where two boats are connected to carry pedestrians. This tower was formerly named Huanyun. Below it is the Leyu Water Pavilion. I renamed my hall Siyun Thatched Cottage. Behind it is the Jingmi Xuan. Although the book collection does not reach ten thousand volumes, it is enough for browsing. The resident, Wang Ruilin, is now seventy years old. He lives in the eastern part of the tower. His door is always open, and we often visit each other. He is filled with poetry and books, tranquil and elegant. He is skilled in composing music. He had a splendid youth and is truly a romantic figure. On the day of the Hundred Flowers Festival, he invited friends to drink at the Stream Tower and celebrate his birthday. That day, the drizzle was like cream, and the light clouds were like catkins. Zhao Gongmingxuan, Zhou Junqiyan, and my elder brother Chunxian arrived first. Mingxuan is good at poetry and prose. Chunxian is also skilled in composing and playing the flute. Tang Danran, Ding Qinbao, and Liu Quran arrived next. The later arrivals were Tang Junqilin, Qian Junmingshan, and Wang Junbotao. Qilin has been the director of the Huainan Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau for two years. He resigned due to bandits and soldiers but was not allowed. He came from Yangzhou yesterday. He presented me with a large-character couplet that reads: "The inkstone field has no bad years; the wine country has a long spring." Hanging it in the Siyun Hall is quite fitting. Mingshan went to the Baijia Bridge in the eastern suburbs, five miles from the city. The gentleman usually wears a yellow Taoist robe and hat, walking alone. One can tell at a glance that he is a recluse. Tonight, he is wearing a purple feather</p>
<p>cloak. He also arrived elegantly. So, the lanterns were lit, and we each examined poems and prose, and viewed paintings and calligraphy. After a few rounds of drinks, we took turns playing music and singing. Quran is proficient in the I Ching and is skilled in poetry and painting. He can also sing songs. He is pure and thin, as if he does not eat human food. He started by singing the song "Picking Up Gold." Qinbao and Ruilin followed. Chunxian played the flute again and then the erhu. Ruilin lightly tapped the sandalwood clappers. We then took turns performing several songs, including "Sweeping Flowers," "Three Drunkards," "Matchmaking," and "Conversation." I love listening to singing, but although I have practiced a few excerpts in small banquets, I am not yet proficient. Qiyan said that the Yuan music of the prosperous age has not been heard for a long time. Mingshan asked about the Gongshang Gongche scales, debating with Quran for a long time, and then he also had some understanding. I said that the Book of Songs was originally ancient ballads, but now they have been lost for a long time. I asked if anyone knew what the Gongshang scale was for the poem "The Yellow River Far Above" on the old flag pavilion painting. No one could answer. Qiyan said that the three chapters of "Pan Huan" were quite similar to the current small songs, so he tried to sing it. Chunxian immediately played the zither to accompany him. Although it was the first time he had played this tune, it was surprisingly in sync. After the meal, the lingering emotions had not subsided. Chunxian sang "Splitting Jade." Ruilin sang "Man Jiang Hong." Qinbao sang several small tunes. Qinbao is seventy-three years old, but his voice is like a beautiful woman's. It is truly a rare and interesting thing. The clock struck twelve. The cold rain was pattering. The guests began to bid farewell. I enjoyed this gathering very much, so I took up my pen and wrote a record of it in the rustling sound of the rain and the blurred shadows of my dreams. I feel that the lingering sound is still in my ears. (No payment accepted)</p>

<p>— Ji Qin</p>
<p>Recently, a friend told me about a certain person in Yushan, who started a business at a young age and had some assets. His wife was talented but jealous, and she could not bear anything. All the maids in the house had to be chosen for their odd ugliness and baldness. At that time, the man was nearing fifty. He was both afraid of Ji Chang and lamented like Bo Dao. He reluctantly agreed to adopt his younger brother's son as his heir. Then, he divided the shops he had created in the past for him to manage, and he did not bother with the income and expenditure of money. However, the adopted son's wife was treacherous and vicious. She actually regarded the divided property as her own and viewed her brother and sister-in-law as superfluous burdens. One day, the man was summoned by a friend and hurriedly went to the capital. He immediately took twenty gold coins from the shop to buy gifts. Unfortunately, the adopted son's wife found out and began to roar and rage. She angrily scolded her husband, saying, "This money belongs to my son. Why give it to this old, childless man?" At that time, the man's wife happened to pass by the window. When she heard these words, she fainted from anger. When she woke up, she cried and refused to eat for three days.</p>
<p>Half a month later, a letter arrived from the capital, informing them that the man had found a job in a certain agency. The wife's heart relaxed slightly. Then, she entrusted matchmakers everywhere to find two girls from poor families, about seventeen or eighteen years old, beautiful and likely to bear sons, and bought them with heavy gold. She took them to the capital. At that time, the man was free from work and was playing chess with a guest. The doorman announced that his wife had arrived, and he was greatly shocked. He abandoned the chess pieces all over the ground and quickly greeted her respectfully. He asked about her intentions. She said that she had come specifically to send him concubines. He did not believe her at all. Before long, he saw the two concubines arrive as well. They were beautiful and charming, making people love them. As a result, he was overjoyed and immediately lived with them in the guest house. The wife ordered them to take turns serving him in bed. Those who were not on duty would stay to accompany her. After several months, they were both pregnant. A year later, they gave birth to two sons. The wife was overjoyed. She then packed her bags and returned home, saying that she was going to collect debts from the adopted son and his wife. She took back all the property and declared that the reason she had found concubines for her husband was for these three words: "(Old, childless man)." The adopted son's wife regretted it too late and eventually died of grief and anger.</p>

<p>When you meet a friend on the street and ask each other for your addresses, do not speak loudly. Be careful that bad people might hear it and use the address to commit fraud. You must be cautious.</p>
<p>When writing letters to others, except for express mail and registered mail, do not write your address on the envelope. Be careful that others might throw away the envelope, and someone might pick it up, which could easily lead to complications. Also, both parties are easily confused.</p>
<p>When you see an advertisement and want to buy something, it is best to see it first and then buy it. If you live in another city, you can ask a nearby relative or friend to handle it for you, so you won't suffer a loss.</p>
<p>When a person goes to take the train with luggage, it is very inconvenient to buy a ticket. You may as well go to the China Travel Service the day before you travel to buy a ticket in advance. It is much more convenient.</p>

<p>Ling Gongweijun's grandson had his one-month celebration. He held a banquet for guests at Yipinxian Restaurant and invited famous male and female amateur opera singers to perform Peking Opera. Among them were several female amateur singers, all of whom were rarely seen. For example, Miss Ruying's "Ti Ying Saves Her Father." This play is still an innovation in the Shanghai amateur opera scene. During the Xipi Manban section, applause rose from all sides. Miss Yanfen's "Qijie" had a beautiful appearance. Her intonation and rhythm were quite similar to Yu Shuang's. She is a rare talent among female amateur singers. The owner of the Aizhen Hall and the owner of the Eyun Hall performed "Sitting in the Palace." Aizhen's Si Lang had the style and singing skills of Tan. Eyun's Princess was both beautiful and talented. Her singing and acting were excellent. Miss Yunying's "Madian" had a round and smooth voice. It was rare to have such an achievement for the first time. Miss Yanfen and Miss Ruying's "Royal Stele Pavilion." Ruying's Wang Youdao had a loud voice. His singing skills were quite similar to Xiao Yu's. Yanfen's Meng Yuehua each had their own strengths. The gliding steps during the rain shelter were especially beautiful.</p>

<p>— Diru</p>
<p>Orchids and irises are elegant flowers.) One stem and one flower is an orchid. One stem and several flowers is an iris.) And those with plain hearts are especially rare and valuable. Now the spring breeze is warm, and the people of Shaoxing who sell flowers gather in our Wu. Knowing that those who buy orchids and irises want to get a plain heart, they often make fake ones to deceive people. The orchid flowers that have already bloomed and have plain hearts are treated with sulfur. They light a fire to fumigate them. The gas adheres to the heart of the flower, and the heart turns plain. When they bloom again next year, there will be no plain hearts at all. Buyers try it repeatedly and know that it is fake. Iris flower stamens often have extremely green and plump ones. They tell people that this is a good species and must be a plain heart. This is also a fake to deceive people. According to those who have been doing this for a long time, it is the jade bamboo in the medicine. They pick it and insert it into the iris flower root, exposing an inch or so, to dazzle people. By the time they are bought home and bloom, the flowers are like shepherd's purse flowers. (That is, vegetable flowers.) Buyers are also often deceived. A friend mentioned wanting to buy orchids and irises, so I told him about this and told the readers of the newspaper who have a fondness for orchids and irises.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Red Flames Soar, Rails Admire the Filial Daughter; Red Carpet Lies Flat, Meeting Famous Actors Instantly. It should be explained that the Mirror Club is directly opposite the racecourse. Its location is very good. It is quite suitable for watching horse racing. So I invited many sisters of the flower world to look at the distance from the railing. In the past, many people were wholeheartedly watching horse racing. Not like now, horse racing has become a specialized gambling machine. The girl named Bi Xiguan is an unrestrained character. She treats Zheng Yanxiu like a little brother. What does it matter if he can't squeeze down and hugs her? Moreover, people who are girls, especially those who are unimportant, insist that there is a kind of rare and strange person in Shanghai, thinking that something strange has happened. They are all looking at the building over there. There is also a group of people who have nothing to do on weekdays wandering around the streets, and they are crowding there to start a riot, clapping and applauding. After this riot, Zheng Yanxiu dared not stand on the balcony again. Bi Xiguan said indifferently, "What are you afraid of them? They eat their fill of white rice and clear water, and they specialize in other people's business. Don't pay attention to them." However, the setting sun is slanting west, and the shadows are scattered. After the skipping, the people watching the horse racing gradually dispersed. There are also many tourists who go to Zhang Yuan. This Zhang Yuan is also known as Wei Chun Yuan. It is pitiful that Shanghai, such a large and prosperous city in China, does not have a public garden for Chinese people to open and walk around. Because in the past, Chinese people lived in the concessions and forgot their origin. It seems that foreigners are the masters in the concessions, and they are guests. Therefore, it has become a situation of reversing the guest and host, and taking over the position of the host, which means the racecourse on the side of Nicheng Bridge. Foreigners can casually run in, but when Chinese people go to the door, they are turned away. In addition, there are several parks in the concession that Chinese people are not allowed to enter. Even the park entrance is hung with a sign that dogs and Chinese people are not allowed to enter, putting Chinese people and dogs in the same category. The dogs they are referring to are naturally not Chinese people's dogs, but Westerners' dogs. Chinese people are not allowed to enter either, not to mention dogs. The prohibition of dogs from entering is because dogs will trample on flowers and trees, or scare children, etc. Why are Chinese people not allowed to enter? This is clearly insulting Chinese people. But at that time, the Chinese people's view was that this place can only be enjoyed by foreigners. Since it is written that Chinese people are not allowed to enter, they had to look and leave. But they don't think that this is a park built by the public, and of course it is for the public to play. Chinese people in the concession pay taxes, and they pay a lot of taxes. As a result, they are regarded as equal to the dogs carried by foreigners. At that time, there were also a few people who understood a little bit, and they argued with the concession authorities, why did Chinese people not enjoy the benefits of the concession park? Later, they delineated a piece of land near the Suzhou River, which was regarded as a park for Chinese people to stroll. But it was a grassy field with a few clumps of trees. There was no equipment at all, and Chinese people did not run to that place.</p>

<p>Readjustment bonds show fatigue . . . Trading volume still reaches over 40 million</p>
<p>Over the past week, the situation in the local bond market has been such that spot transactions are still slow. The total trading volume for the entire week was 134,000 yuan, with readjustment bonds accounting for 68,000 yuan, financial bonds for 35,000 yuan, 6% Consol bonds for 21,000 yuan, 2.5% Continuance bonds for only 8,000 yuan, and only 4,000 to 5,000 yuan for other bonds. There were no transactions for 7-year bonds or 96 bonds. Although the futures market was quieter compared to the previous week, market sentiment was still considered good, and there was still a substantial amount of trading each day. The first two days of the week were relatively strong, with over 8.7 million yuan on Monday and over 7.7 million yuan on Tuesday. The following days were calmer, with daily trading volume generally around 6 million yuan. The total trading volume for the entire week was 40,670,000 yuan, a decrease of over 11,700,000 yuan compared to the previous week. Tax bureau bonds continued to have the largest volume, accounting for 15,050,000 yuan, divided into 3,625,000 yuan for the March contract and 11,580,000 yuan for the April contract. Rehabilitation bonds also performed well, with 2,370,000 yuan for the March contract and 5,250,000 yuan for the April contract. Continuance bonds had 2,030,000 yuan for the March contract and 5,015,000 yuan for the April contract. 6% Consol bonds had 1,970,000 yuan for the March contract and 2,320,000 yuan for the April contract. 2.5% Continuance bonds only had 2,875,000 yuan, divided into 985,000 yuan for the March contract and 1,890,000 yuan for the April contract. Readjustment bonds had 480,000 yuan for the March contract and 1,760,000 yuan for the April contract. 96 bonds had 415,000 yuan for the March contract and 770,000 yuan for the April contract. The 7-year financial bonds of both types remained very slow, with the 7-year bonds having 135,000 yuan for the March contract and 335,000 yuan for the April contract. The Continuance financial bonds only had 465,000 yuan for the March contract, and there was still no market for the April contract. As for the bond price fluctuations over the past week, on the first day of the week, the market sentiment suddenly became tense due to the tense political situation, and people were weak and unanimously fell. The near-term readjustment bonds decreased by as much as 3.60 yuan, the next month's contract decreased by more than 3 yuan, and the tax bureau futures also fell back by 2.78 yuan. Other bonds fell by 7, 8, or 9 jiao or so. Only financial 96 bonds had minimal fluctuations. On the second day of the week, market sentiment was slightly calmer, and the market took advantage of the low prices to buy, so the prices rose again. The tax bureau and readjustment bond futures both rose by about 1 yuan, and other bonds also improved by 5 or 6 jiao. From then until Friday, the bond market was calm and very stable. Most days there were only fluctuations of a few jiao, which was slightly more advantageous for gains than for losses, and the number was very small. On the last day of the weekend, however, buying interest suddenly increased, and prices rose significantly. The next month's futures for the tax bureau and readjustment bonds each rose by more than 2 yuan, and the rehabilitation futures also improved by 1 yuan and a few jiao. In addition to 96 financial bonds, the others generally increased by about 5 or 6 jiao. As a result, compared to the previous week, except for the near-term futures for readjustment spot and tax bureau spot bonds still falling slightly, the others generally increased slightly. The future of the bond market is still quite gloomy. The statistics on bond price fluctuations over the past week are listed below (unit: yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e120">Yarn Market: Softening Conditions in the Yarn Market Last Week <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Political situation affects consumption decline</p>
<p>Sellers heavily pressuring, difficult to rebound temporarily</p>
<p>The yarn market was still stable at the beginning of last week, but the trend was weak, which was probably due to the tense political situation. There was a large amount of inventory at the bottom, and there was a risk of decline. Fortunately, the overseas cotton yarn market situation was unanimously trending upward, and people's hearts were strengthened by it. However, the yarn produced in this local market every day is difficult to completely sell off, and there is still a surplus. Moreover, the war has signs of prolongation, so although foreign cotton has risen, local yarn is still difficult to raise. And a portion of large sellers are exerting great pressure, searching the market for 7,000 to 8,000 bales of spot goods in preparation for delivery. With the standard in this situation, it is difficult for the buyers to support, so near-month standard yarn has a crack at the weekend, and the downward trend is more intense. As a result, near-month standard yarn fell by one liang, eight or nine qian to two liang compared to last week, and distant prices fell by four or five qian. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 83,900 bales. Currently, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Sichuan traders are still buying, and others are secondary. Japanese yarn is still hard due to the shortage of goods and sales prices, and local yarn is also flat. It has been found that various traders bought a total of 9,140 bales for the week, and factories opened 2,000+ bales. The following is a record of the purchase volume by various traders:</p>
<p>Trader | Bales | Trader | Bales | Trader | Bales</p>
<p>-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------</p>
<p>Tianjin | 2,200 | Qingdao | 1,950 | Sichuan | 1,220</p>

<p>Foreign Cotton Prices Soar… Exciting People</p>
<p>The cotton market is quite firm, with a sudden increase of over 100 points in American cotton prices, which has excited people. This is due to the shortage of goods. Merchants from Hubei are holding on tightly to their stocks. Furthermore, the rise in foreign cotton prices has strengthened buyers' attitudes, making the rising trend even sharper. Currently, the demand from various cotton mills is still sluggish, so the situation remains stable. However, there is unusually enthusiastic activity in the Hubei cotton futures market, with prices for all months up 8-9 cents compared to last week. Some Hubei merchants have sold off slightly to settle their positions due to the price increase, so the market on the weekend is a bit more relaxed. Total transactions for the week are estimated at 173,100 piculs. Sources at the docks include 1,600 bales of Yao cotton and 2,500 bales of Tong cotton. Manufacturers imported 15,800 piculs, and trading firms imported 4,480 piculs. American cotton is up over 100 points compared to last week. The amounts of spot cotton purchased by various manufacturers and trading firms are listed below:</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Imports  Highest Price Lowest Price Volume of Transactions  Delivery Terms</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton  38.00  34.50  3,200 pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market conditions were mixed. It was firm initially due to short covering, but weakened later due to profit-taking sales. Futures prices fluctuated between a rise and fall of 1 to 10 points. Spot prices rose 10 points. English cotton rose 1 to 4 points, with spot prices up 16 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 15 points. The Indian cotton market was firm and rising. Pingguoer rose 9 rupees, forward contracts rose 8 rupees. Aomula rose 9 rupees, forward contracts rose 9 to 10 rupees. Bairuoxi rose 10 rupees, forward contracts rose 11 rupees. (Originally telegraphed on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Yesterday, over ten rice boats arrived at the docks in Zhabei. Sales were stable. Early in the morning, the price of Beijing rice was slightly weaker, but because sellers were not eager to sell quickly and avoided being undercut by buyers, they uniformly maintained high asking prices. Therefore, trading volume was low, but the overall market remained firm. The supply of Bo rice was scarce, and sales were steady, with no price increases or decreases. Buying interest in Yangxian rice was quiet. Although some out-of-town merchants inquired about it, they seemed to think the price was too high and were watching the market. Demand for local Xian rice in places like Duzi and Kebu was weak. The market seemed a bit listless, with prices barely holding steady at the original levels. The turnover of Yuan Yin Hua rice was also slow. Fortunately, supply was not heavy, so market prices remained stable.</p>
<p>In South Shanghai, boats arriving at the riverfront were still docking. Sales were not as brisk as the previous day because various rice merchants had already stocked up on Jing rice from Changshu and other places in previous market sessions, so demand was slightly weaker, and prices were stable. Sales of early Bo rice and early rice from places like Qingdao and Sijing along the South Road were not dull, but the goods were moving at steady pace, so the prices also stabilized accordingly. Among them, buyers were very welcome to special high-quality goods. Prices may moderately rise soon. Because of foreign rice, the market conditions for Yang Du Jian rice did not improve, and only ordinary goods were a bit tight. Sales are very active, and inventories will soon be depleted. The future market is difficult to predict. The arrival and sales of Bai Yuan rice are evenly matched, and the situation is quite stable.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Progress in the Silk Market Last Week <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Silk More Expensive, European Merchants Abandon Japanese Silk and Seek Chinese Silk</p>
<p>Demand Exceeds Supply, Factories Experience an Increase of Over Ten Taels</p>
<p>Last week, the Shanghai foreign firm silk market turned from firm to rising because Japanese silk prices turned upward after the Japanese government secured a large amount of funds to support silk prices and compensate for losses. Furthermore, gold prices also rose. Since Japan abandoned the gold ban, it has switched to the gold standard, so Japanese silk prices have risen even more, and sales have been stagnant. Silver prices are surprisingly cheap. Chinese silk is still priced in silver taels, so European and American silk merchants are abandoning Japanese silk for Chinese silk. Silk telegrams are successively transferred to Shanghai, and silk sales are smooth. The dry cocoon inventory in Shanghai is low, and it is more than three months before the new cocoons enter the market. There is not much silk, and the supply is about to fall short of demand. In addition, cocoon prices are not loose, and silk costs are still high. Each manufacturer's attitude is firm. The Shanghai factory experienced a sharp increase of more than ten taels. Last week, the foreign firm silk market turned from firm to rising, which is why. A total of more than 500 packages of spot and forward silk were transacted throughout the week, and more than 800 packages were exported. The foreign firms have a total inventory of about 700 packages of silk. Overseas Chinese silk prices are not rising much because Japanese silk prices are turning weak. The following is a list of Chinese silk market prices in European and American markets at the end of last week (New York price per pound, unit is gold dollar; Lyon price per kilogram, unit is French franc):</p>
<p>Silk Type New York Lyon Silk Type New York Lyon</p>

<h3 id="e125">Ministry Order to Expand the Jianghai Customs Area <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Superintendent has ordered the Customs Commissioner to comply with the expansion of the Shanghai Jianghai Northern Area. The approval of the Ministry of Finance has been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has recently ordered the Jianghai Customs Superintendent, stating that the Shanghai Special Municipality Government had previously consulted that, as proposed by the Shanghai Special Municipality Government Construction Discussion Committee, the committee members Qian Xinzhi and others suggested expanding the Shanghai Customs area. The proposal was submitted to the first meeting of the fourth standing committee, and it was resolved to hand it over to a special task force to review it together with the original proposer. According to the review report, the committee approved the issue of expanding the customs area according to the original proposal. The scope of the expansion should be determined by the municipal government. The proposal was resubmitted to the first meeting of the fifth standing committee, and it was resolved to pass it according to the review report. The original proposal is enclosed. Please determine how to handle it and reply. The original proposal is attached. This is approved. It is noted that Shanghai is the premier commercial port in East Asia, with ships converging and merchants gathering. The proposal to expand the Shanghai Customs area is indeed an urgent plan to revitalize the city and develop industry and commerce. The scope of the expansion, which has now been determined by the Municipal Government based on current needs, extends upstream to Zhangjiatang Port and downstream to Wusong. The corresponding proposal is enclosed and submitted to the Ministry for review. Please quickly instruct the Jianghai Customs Superintendent and the Jianghai Customs Commissioner to comply with and reply. The original proposal is attached. This is approved. It should be noted that, as mentioned in the original proposal, there is indeed a need to expand the Jianghai Customs area. However, whether it is appropriate to extend the expansion scope upstream to Zhangjiatang Port and downstream to Wusong should be clearly investigated and determined. The Customs Administration ordered the Inspectorate General of Customs to survey and map the area and submit it for review. According to the Inspectorate General of Customs' reply, the Customs Administration instructed the Customs Commissioner of Jianghai to comply, conduct a detailed review, and provide detailed maps for review and transfer. The Customs Commissioner of Jianghai, Mei Weiliang, reported that expanding the customs area of the port is indeed an important plan to adapt to the development of the port, and all the sections mentioned in the original consultation of the Shanghai Special Municipality Government are feasible. Based on previous orders, he has drawn detailed maps of the existing area of the port and the areas to be expanded for review. It is noted that the boundaries of the expanded Shanghai Customs area set in the map are appropriate. Based on the previous report, he is enclosing the original map for review.

<h3 id="e127">Record of the Silk Industry Discussion Conference in Jiangsu and Zhejiang <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Reporting on Negotiations with the Export Silk Association</p>
<p>Discussing the Settlement of Silk Valuation and Public Weight Inspection</p>
<p>The General Association of Silk Cocoons in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui convened a discussion conference yesterday (the 22nd) at 3 p.m., gathering silk factory colleagues from various provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang to improve the procedures for unwinding silk in foreign firms. Huang Jinchen, Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, Zhu Zhuxian, Sun Rongchang, and others, eighty or ninety people in total, attended. Huang Jinchen and Shen Huachen were elected as the presidium. First, Chairman Huang announced the purpose of the meeting. Then, Chairman Shen stood up to report on the progress of the negotiations on the case, briefly requesting the improvement of silk unwinding procedures, changes in silver collection dates, and the adoption of sample strips. After repeated efforts by myself and Chairman Huang to reason with Mr. Shagu, the chairman of the Export Silk Association, and put forward requirements, we have now received a formal letter in reply from the association, acknowledging the following three points: (1) For consignment silk shipped for export on Saturdays, the silk funds will be paid on Saturday morning; (2) For the adoption of sample strips, only two sample strips are allowed to be drawn for every five pieces of silk; (3) Return of reeling strips. The reeling strips drawn by each foreign firm should be issued with a receipt by the foreign merchant, indicating the number of strips and the quantity. In the future, the manufacturers will use this receipt to recover the reeling strips from the foreign firm and re-weigh the quantity to see if it is compliant. The association has fully accepted the above three points, which has won back a lot of benefits for the industry. The association agreed to immediately instruct all foreign firms to comply. All of our Chinese silk merchants should also strictly implement it and not give up again. Next, the letter from the Export Silk Association requesting two issues was discussed. Because the matter was important, the discussion lasted for a long time. As a result, (1) The foreign merchants requested that the silk should be delivered six days earlier than the agreed month period for unwinding silk in the future. Each manufacturer stated that this matter</p>
<p>Can be said. The public decided to refute the matter with reason. However, when necessary, it can be stated when the transaction is concluded that, with the approval of the factory, the date of delivery should be indicated in the order; otherwise, it will be handled in accordance with the regulations. (2) The foreign merchants requested that the public weight be used to bake 1/1800 pound of silk strips, which is not suitable for exporting in bulk. The case of calculating the value by combining the number of strips and quantities will be resolved by investigating the methods of the Japanese raw silk inspection office as the standard. Finally, Chairman Shen stated that the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau has approved the extension of the implementation of the public weight inspection of exported factory silk for one month. The deadline for implementation on April 1 is approaching soon. Each colleague should actively prepare. The meeting adjourned after discussion. It was already six o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e128">The Department Orders No Arbitrary Fines in Encountered Cases <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government received a letter from the Jiangsu Civil Affairs Department stating that the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of each county are important local officials, and the county magistrate is especially an official who is close to the people. During this period of political tutelage, how should officials use both authority and virtue to influence and guide the people so that the people can be inspired to participate in revolutionary construction? It is inappropriate to abuse political power and increase the suffering of the people. However, it has been found that in recent years, in cases involving accusations, large fines have been imposed arbitrarily in various counties. Such a situation, even if there is nothing else in the locality, can easily give others grounds for criticism. Therefore, I am issuing a strict warning that you must not arbitrarily impose excessive fines again in the future, or use local public welfare as an excuse to coerce large amounts of donations. You must strictly abide by this. Yesterday, County Magistrate Leng ordered the Public Security Bureau to comply accordingly.</p>

One clinic would be in Minhang on the first day of the month, and the other in Wuhui on the sixth day of the month. (4) Merger of Xia Ershijiu Tu (a local administrative unit). It was decided that it would be merged into Sanyang Township. (5) Omitted. The meeting adjourned after discussion.</p>

<p>Reply to the Representatives of Navigation Households</p>
<p>The representatives of navigation households, Xing Zhigang and others, stated that the Nanshi Nanhui Hall Wharf, where navigation ships originally berthed, has recently been occupied by kiln cargo ships, and the wood shops along the river have stacked wood on the river surface. When navigation ships arrive at the port, passengers have to walk on uneven woodpiles, and there are boat women who form gangs and demand arbitrary demands from passengers. Therefore, they petitioned the Municipal Public Security Bureau to eliminate all navigation obstacles mentioned above so that travelers from the four townships could get on and off safely without danger. The original petition has been published in previous reports. It is now known that the representatives received a reply yesterday stating that the petition has been noted, and the Water Patrol Team has been ordered to investigate and handle it separately. Please be informed. This is the reply.</p>

<p>The Temporary National Goods Commercial Center of the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association in Shanghai wrote to the Shanghai Special Municipality Public Works Bureau, stating that this time, for the purpose of raising goods and promoting national goods, a temporary commercial center was jointly established by five national goods groups. Advertisements were printed and ordered to be posted. The two advertisement management offices of the bureau, one in South Shanghai and one in Zhabei, stated that the advertisements were not stamped and a handling fee of one yuan per thousand pieces was required to be paid for stamping. There are also many difficulties. It has been found that the Central Political Conference has resolved that national goods advertisements should be exempt from taxes and has consulted with the National Government to order the provincial and municipal governments to comply. There is no provision for collecting handling fees separately. Moreover, the concession did not object when the advertisements were posted. Please quickly order the department to waive the fees and stamp the advertisements as soon as possible to facilitate publicity.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Eleventh District Municipal Committee Petitions for Free Dog Registration <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Extensive writing emphasizing the necessity of keeping dogs in rural areas</p>
<p>Sincere petition hoping for fundamental solutions to hygiene issues</p>
<p>The municipal committee members of various districts in this city, to petition for the exemption of registration fees for household dogs in order to alleviate the people's hardship, submitted a document to the Health Bureau stating: "Submitting this petition, as per your bureau's Order No. 374, which stated, 'To be obeyed,' upon investigation of the regulations for registering restaurants and household dogs, which have already been promulgated, each rural district should also organize separately to comply with the regulations. However, considering the lower living standards in rural districts, this bureau, in consideration of the residents of rural districts, has already submitted to the municipal government for approval a reduction of half the registration fee (i.e., fifty cents each time). It is now decided that from January 1st to March 1st of the nineteenth year, a two-month registration period will be held. Except for the Wusong and Gaoqiao districts, which should directly submit their applications to the health model district offices in those areas, all restaurants and household dogs in the Yin'hang, Zhenru, Pusong, Fahua, Caojing, Tangqiao, Luhang, Pengpu, Yangsi, and Jiangwan districts must uniformly report to the municipal committee members of their respective districts and pay the fees, which should be compiled and submitted to this bureau once every ten days for review before permits are issued. Besides issuing separate orders and proclamations, the municipal committee members of each district are hereby ordered to comply and implement this order." Upon receiving this order, except for the restaurant registration, which has already been handled separately and reported to your bureau, the committee members believe that the collection of fees for household dog registration is absolutely unacceptable. We respectfully submit this to the director. Upon investigation, most of the households in each district are farmers. Taking Zhenru district as an example, out of a total of 5,410 households in the entire district, 4,524 are farming households, accounting for more than 83% of the total. And seven or eight out of ten farming households keep dogs. The usefulness of dogs is to supplement the inadequacy of police force. Dogs are loyal to their duty and are exceptionally alert. Upon hearing any sound, they bark incessantly, and the owner, upon hearing the sound, prepares for it. Therefore, thieves often hesitate to target homes that keep dogs. Moreover, in the event of bandits committing robbery, a dog barks wildly, and other dogs echo, and nearby villagers, upon hearing the alarm, inform each other, rise up to resist, and the bandits retreat. This is the usefulness of dogs. Therefore, rural people love dogs as much as Arabs love horses, treating them as family members. Even extremely poor households, struggling to make ends meet, often enjoy keeping dogs. Now, the number of households that keep dogs is not small, and the usefulness of dogs is so great. However, your bureau has a decree for registering household dogs and a collection fee of fifty cents per head and a one-cent stamp tax. For the entire city, the amount must be considerable. However, in handling government affairs, it is important to have a purpose. What is the purpose of holding household dog registration? If it is to prevent rabid and ferocious dogs from biting people, then it is enough to order dog owners to keep their dogs tied up in one place during the day, preventing them from roaming freely, or to add muzzles to prevent them from biting. This can achieve the purpose, and there is no need to register them door-to-door.</p>
<p>With extreme freedom, rabid and ferocious dogs still bite people as before. What benefit is there to public health? If it is for collecting people's wealth, then in this time of consecutive years of famine, most farmers in the suburbs cannot make ends meet even from one morning to the next. This six-cent registration fee is the equivalent of five days' worth of grain for the poor. Now, to collect it because of keeping dogs, is it not inevitable that the farmers will react and feel resentment? It is still remembered that when the rebel Sun Chuanfang stole power and Ding Wenjiang was appointed as the Shanghai-Songhu Superintendent, under the guise of implementing new policies, a household tax of twenty cents for doorplates was collected in the Tangqiao district, which caused the villagers to beat gongs and gather crowds, destroying the homes of those in charge. The situation was turbulent and unapproachable, and those who talked about it still changed color. Is the amount now several times that amount? Reading Tang Zhen's "Enriching the People" chapter, it says, "Wealth is the treasure of the country and the life of the people. Treasure cannot be stolen, and life cannot be robbed. Sages treat the people as their children and grandchildren and the four seas as their treasury. They do not steal their treasure or rob their life, so every family is prosperous, and wives and children are peaceful." It also says, "Those who take by abuse will lose a hundred gold for taking one gold, and lose a hundred rooms for taking one room." Therefore, Confucius had the saying that "oppressive government is fiercer than a tiger," which clearly shows the future. How can we not fear it? How can we not be careful? The way to hygiene is multifaceted. Not observing the pits and toilets in each district, which are located on thoroughfares, with foul odors steaming, and maggots gathering. The tributaries and interrupted harbors, with water as black as ink, and foul odors unbearable. Between summer and autumn, epidemics spread. Because there are no hospitals, there is no way to treat them. People infect each other, and the dead are piled on top of each other. Those with a little heart cannot bear it. For the sake of the people's health, it seems that these matters should be addressed first, seeking fundamental solutions. These matters are ten or a hundred times more important than dog registration. The committee members have studied the municipal administrations of various countries, but they can still distinguish whether the application is suitable for the environment or not. Now, the concession has dog registration and dog permit procedures because densely populated areas are not suitable for raising dogs. Therefore, there are measures to limit it. Now, to apply it to remote rural areas is obviously unsuitable for the current environment. Reading Qu You's line, "The master only needs to guard the door, avoiding the labor of chasing Korean dogs for hunting," it is clear that rural people cannot live without dogs for a day. We dare to humbly submit to Director Hu, requesting to change the method of dog registration, allowing it to be free to alleviate the people's hardship, which would truly be for the public's convenience. Respectfully submitted to Hu, Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Health Bureau, by Yang Xinzheng, Municipal Committee Member of Caojing District, Hong Lanxiang of Zhenru, Wang Shouyu, Zhang Qiwen of Luhang, Yang Hongjun of Fahua, Zhong Renjie of Gaoqiao, Chen Yafu of Pusong, Wu Xuen of Jiangwan, Yan Enzuo, Liu Ziwen of Wusong, Pan Wuding of Gaohang, Zhou Nianzu of Pengpu, Ling Zhibin, Zhu Zonglu of Yinhang, Zhu Jiajun, Wang Hui of Tangqiao, and Chen Tianxi of Yangsi.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Jisheng Society's Disaster Relief Report in Beiping Nankou <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>This port's Chinese Jisheng Society recently received a report from She Jungsheng, director of the disaster relief office stationed in Tianjin, stating that the 24 villages in the eighth district of Beiping Nankou reported that the villages along the mountain range in Nankou Fuxingzhuang suffered a rare disaster last year. Regardless of wealth or poverty, all suffered from famine. Families had no stone's worth of grain, and their homes were empty. Brothers, wives, and children were scattered, and the old and weak were dying in ditches. Fortunately, the Shanghai Chinese Jisheng Society showed great compassion and provided disaster relief. Over the past few months, time and again, the famine victims have received great kindness. However, as winter ends and spring arrives, all the grain seeds have been exhausted, and only one or two out of a hundred plowing oxen and horses are still alive. There is no way to sow seeds. Now, at this time of year when the old grain is depleted and the new grain has not yet arrived, the famine victims have no way to make plans. They earnestly request extra kindness and continued spring relief to help them through this difficult time. Once the autumn harvest is promising, they can celebrate their survival, which is all due to the great virtue of your society, etc. Since last winter, the society has provided disaster relief in Nankou three times, spending a considerable amount of money. Now, they are requesting a fourth spring relief. If the society agrees, its resources will be stretched thin. If it refuses, its previous efforts will be in vain. A detailed letter has been sent to Director She Guisheng, stating that after the 600 big stones of grain and corn from the three Nankou relief efforts have been transported and distributed, a thorough investigation should be conducted to determine how many people are still unable to survive without relief and how much grain is actually lacking, and then a decision should be made to maintain the current situation and alleviate the suffering.</p>

Henan Provincial Relief Committee kowtows." It is reported that after receiving the telegram, Representative Zhou immediately telegraphed the Nanjing Relief Committee, requesting to attend the committee meeting in Nanjing on Monday (the 24th) to personally present the disaster situation.</p>

<p>Plot to Embezzle 5,000 Gold Failed</p>
<p>Detained on Suspicion of Arson</p>
<p>Xing Ximing, a native of Jiangyin, who is not yet twenty years old, was recommended by relatives to work at Tongli Gold Shop, No. 4 Museum Road, last year. He was quite intelligent and was liked by his superiors. A few days ago, the shop accountant ordered him to call Chunyuan Money Shop to get 5,000 taels of silver. Xing took this opportunity to order 10,000 taels in the call. When the money was delivered, Xing gave 5,000 taels to the accountant. Xing embezzled the remaining 5,000 taels, which was a term draft, and took it as his own. He then took the draft to Chunyuan Shop, hoping to cash it. Because he was not familiar with the cashing procedure, he inevitably revealed flaws. The shop clerk immediately called Tongli to inquire, and Xing's scheme was foiled. He returned to the shop in frustration. The shop owner, Sun Dongchuan, thought that he was young and ignorant and gave him a slight reprimand as a warning. However, on the night before last, a fire suddenly broke out in Tongli's office. Fortunately, it was discovered immediately, and water was used to extinguish it, avoiding a major conflagration. Sun Dongchuan investigated the matter in detail afterward and felt that Xing was very suspicious of the fire or that he had deliberately set the fire. He reported to the General Inspector's Office and sent detectives to arrest Xing. The next day, he was sent to the Provisional Court for investigation. According to Xing's confession, he woke up late at night, defecated, sat by the table, and took a cigarette to smoke. Then Mr. Fang came in. Fearing being blamed, he secretly threw the remaining cigarette under the table. Unexpectedly, a fire suddenly broke out afterward. He immediately took water to extinguish it and did not intentionally set the fire, etc. He hired lawyer Jiang Rong to defend him and requested bail. Judge Gao ordered the defendant to pay a bail of 300 yuan and rescheduled the hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Foreign Press Discusses Japanese and the Municipal Council <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Citizens Must Maintain Strict Surveillance</p>
<p>The *Millard's Review*, translated by the World News Agency, states: According to reports, the Japanese Road Business Association of Shanghai has sent a letter to the Public Concession's Municipal Council, requesting three things: (1) Increase the number of police officers within the Concession to 500; (2) Increase the use of senior Japanese police officers in the Police Department; (3) The authority and treatment of Japanese officers in the Police Department should be equal to those of other foreign officers. This report seems to be in line with the words of former Municipal Council Chairman Arnold in his letter published in the previous issue of this newspaper. According to Arnold, the reason for his failure in the last Municipal Council election was that he had rejected the Japanese's demands (disproportionate increase in Japanese police and other matters), so the Japanese cast opposing votes against him, preventing him from being re-elected. Arnold also said that if the British in the Concession do not come out to vote in large numbers, the municipal administration will be controlled by the Japanese election machine). After Arnold's letter was published, an unnamed Japanese national (spokesperson) denied his statement, saying that the Japanese did not oppose the increase in the number of Chinese members of the Municipal Council (but of course, the Chinese directors should not be in the majority), etc. Observing these words of the Japanese, their intentions are clearly revealed, that is, the Japanese currently have greater representation and police power, and they do not want any increase in Chinese power. This kind of request from the Japanese can be ignored, but there are many foreigners (Europeans and Americans) in the Public Concession who would rather agree to the Japanese's requests than the Chinese's requests. In other words, these foreigners would rather trade with the Japanese, increasing the Japanese's power in the Municipal Council and the Police Department, than see the Chinese gain a controlling voice in the Concession. This is the key to the overall situation, and the Chinese should pay close attention to it. Although the election in the Municipal Council appeared to be open, it was actually conducted in secret. The oppressive situation imposed by the Japanese as stated in Arnold's letter has obviously been the case for a long time, but Arnold is only speaking about it now, and the public in Shanghai is only learning about it now. In that case, among the directors elected this time, there may be those who have significant obligations to the Japanese. The three Japanese requests mentioned above may have originated from this. We must strictly monitor this scene of Municipal Council politics, otherwise, one day the Municipal Council will transfer the Concession not back to the Chinese, but to the Japanese. Only when it has become a fact will we wake up as if from a dream.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Robbery Using Anesthetic Powder <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Able to Make the Victim Unconscious</p>
<p>Thief Shen A'jin Arrested</p>
<p>Shen A'jin, a habitual thief from Shaoxing, was carrying a package when he passed through Rue Amiral Bayle in the French Concession a few days ago. He was spotted by detectives Lu Zhulin and Mao Jingen from the special division of the French Concession Police, who arrested Shen and seized the stolen goods.  Upon opening the package, the chief detective found a white lambskin robe, gold bracelets, gold chains, and banknotes, worth over 700 yuan. A small packet of anesthetic powder was also found on Shen's person. Under interrogation, Shen confessed that he had stolen the items from the Senchang pawnshop at 90 Avenue de l'Observatoire. He also revealed that twenty-seven pieces of foreign cloth had been taken to the Chinese area and pawned by his accomplice, Shen Changlin. When asked about the purpose of the powder, Shen replied that he used it during robberies by lighting the powder, causing the victims to become unconscious.  The chief detective, having obtained the confession, ordered Shen to be detained. He also instructed detectives to arrest Shen Changlin in the Chinese area, recover the stolen goods, and bring him back to the police station. It was further discovered that the thieves had stolen three leather coats from Pan Youliang's house at 1 Rue Pingji Li last month, which were pawned for spending money. Therefore, the victims were summoned to the French Concession Court the day before yesterday to prosecute Shen and his gang.  The plaintiffs, Min Ruizhi and Pan Youliang, testified about the theft, stating that the defendants had broken into their houses. Although they were initially aware of the intrusion, their bodies became paralyzed, and they soon fell unconscious, fearing that the thieves had used anesthetic drugs. They requested severe punishment. When questioned, Shen A'jin claimed that the stolen goods were actually stolen by Wang A'rong, who was still at large, while offering evasive answers. Shen Changlin claimed that he only helped with pawning and did not participate in the theft. The judge, Mr. Zhu, ordered the defendants to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Conflict Between Workers and Militia Members in Xijialong <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Caused by Stealing Vegetables</p>
<p>Militia Member Zhang Injured</p>
<p>Yesterday at approximately 1:00 PM, a conflict occurred in Xijialong, located one and a half li north of Zhenru in the western suburbs of Shanghai near Caojiadu. Over one hundred Jiangbei workers clashed with militia members due to the theft of vegetables by the workers. One militia member was injured and a rifle and a row of bullets were seized. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Cause of the Incident: Recently, vegetables and bamboo shoots grown by villagers near Zhenru have been frequently stolen by groups of Jiangbei workers, causing significant losses to the villagers. As a result, the Zhenru district militia often sends out patrols to protect the crops. Yesterday at approximately 1:00 PM, Lin Xiao'erzi, a Jiangbei worker employed at a certain oil factory, was caught stealing vegetables from a field in Xijialong. He was spotted by a militia member who tried to stop him and question him. However, the worker not only refused to comply but immediately gathered four or five workers to cause trouble.</p>
<p>Workers Gather: The district militia headquarters, fearing that the workers' ignorance would lead to trouble, dispatched over ten militia members to mediate. However, workers already rushed back to the oil factory (which was closed for Sunday) and immediately gathered over one hundred workers, some carrying shoulder poles, some with pistols, some with iron bars, and some with bayonets, creating a menacing atmosphere.</p>
<p>A Fierce Fight: Once the workers arrived at the location, they swarmed upon the militia members, attacking them and firing several pistol shots. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the militia members also fired two shots while retreating. The militia headquarters then dispatched over ten more militia members to provide reinforcements. The workers bravely kidnapped a militia member named Zhang Jingshan and dispersed. The militia members immediately pursued and captured six leading workers, who were brought back to the militia headquarters. It was not yet clear whether they had fired the shots that injured people.</p>
<p>Severe Beating of Militia Member: Militia member Zhang Jingshan was kidnapped by the workers, who dragged him away while beating him. They took him behind the oil factory and seized his rifle, a row of bullets, an armed belt, and his badge number. His uniform was torn to shreds. The militia member was then tied to a telephone pole and subjected to relentless kicking and punching. As the crowd of onlookers grew, the workers scattered and fled. The militia member suffered head injuries that caused profuse bleeding, and sustained multiple injuries on his body, leading to unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Police Dispatched for Rescue: Tai Zurong, the platoon leader of the second platoon of the first company of the militia, immediately reported the incident to the Sixth District Police Station. Section Chief Duan dispatched Head Constable Hu from the Second Precinct along with police officers, but the workers had already fled. They rescued militia member Zhang Jingshan and brought him back to the station. Section Chief Duan questioned the militia member, who stated that he was thirty years old, lived in Xijialong, made a living by farming, and was a member of the 61st militia. Section Chief Duan, noting that the militia member was severely injured, granted Platoon Leader Qin permission to take him back for medical treatment. It was reported that three or four other militia members were also injured.</p>

<p>Four Thieves Arrested, Admitting Their Crimes Without Reservation</p>
<p>Pistol Retrieved From Under Roof Tiles in Yunzhou Inn</p>
<p>Xu, the captain of the Shanghai Special City Public Security Bureau's water patrol team, discovered that the thieves involved in the robbery of 5,000 yuan in foreign currency from the Longtoufang at the Shanghai North Railway Station were frequently seen at the Zhongxin Teahouse on North Sixth Road in the city. He dispatched detectives Ma Ruyun, Zhang Yuting, Yang Chunting, and Liu Changrui to secretly monitor the teahouse on the morning of the day before yesterday. At approximately 10:00 AM, one of the thieves appeared. The detectives, taking advantage of his unsuspecting state, arrested him with the help of local police and brought him back to the patrol team. During the preliminary interrogation by the captain, the thief identified himself as Bi Xiangsheng and confessed to the robbery without reservation. He also implicated several accomplices, who were hiding in Room 26 of the Yunzhou Inn on North Sixth Road. The detectives were dispatched to arrest the accomplices, Xue Yuqing, Wu Ziyu, and Wang Shisan. After being brought to the patrol team, the three thieves confessed to the crime without hesitation. They also revealed that a pistol was hidden under the roof tiles on the third floor of the Yunzhou Inn. The detectives went to the inn and recovered the pistol. As the case involved robbery, the captain ordered a written report to be submitted to the Third Section of the City Public Security Bureau for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Lecture at the YMCA Yesterday <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Sex Problems and Youth</p>
<p>Yesterday marked the third lecture of the academic lecture series held by the Sichuan Road YMCA, titled "Sex Problems and Youth." Both men and women attended enthusiastically. The speaker was Dr. Eddy from the United States, and the translation was provided by Mr. Wu Zengyu, with shorthand recording by Bingxun National Phonetic Speedometer Society. The gist of the lecture is recorded below. Before us lies a very important and difficult problem, namely the issue of sex, which is most closely related to us. In the past, however, we have suffered greatly because we have neglected this important issue and have not paid attention to it. There are two driving forces in life: hunger and love. One is the struggle for survival, and the other is the war of love. These two forces can make people succeed or fail. Sex can lead to bad things, but with proper guidance and rules, it can become a very good thing. It all depends on whether we are the masters of sex or are controlled by it. What is sex? It is the mutual love between men and women who are physiologically different, forming families and filling them with joy. We should regard sex as the most beautiful, the most sacred, and the noblest thing in life. There are two extremes in the issue of sex: excessive indulgence and excessive restraint. Both can lead to unhappiness. Because sex is the greatest driving force in life, gradually growing and expanding in scope, education should start from the family. Otherwise, bad children will also corrupt others. A person who receives good sex education can have a strong body and achieve success in their career. Washington was able to succeed because he paid attention to sex education. At the time, there was a very intelligent person of similar status who turned into a traitor because he did not pay attention to sex issues. Mazzini said that no unchaste person can be a true patriot. Often, a person who contracts a venereal disease harms their wife, a truly great sin. Therefore, young people must maintain their purity. Sex can elevate or lower one's character, build up or destroy. Young people, do not lose your wisdom, and let wisdom guide you throughout your life. Maintain your purity. This afternoon at 5:30 PM, Dr. Eddy will continue his lecture at the YMCA, titled "The Choice Between the Sexes."</p>

<p>Zhang Zhongyi Eager to Marry</p>
<p>Zhu Dasheng Finds It Difficult to Act as Matchmaker</p>
<p>Zhang Zhongyi, a villager from Xinjing Jiangqiao in the northwest suburbs of Shanghai, is approaching thirty and still unmarried. Zhu Dasheng approached him recently, claiming to have a woman from Taicang named Wang Suyun, who is twenty-two years old and whose mother wished to arrange her marriage. The dowry was very low, which suited Zhang's wishes. However, he needed to see her in person. Zhu brought Suyun to Zhang's house, and Zhang was delighted after seeing her. He asked Zhu to help arrange the marriage. Zhu was even more accommodating and willing to let Suyun move in first. He asked Zhang to pay 80 yuan as a deposit to inform her mother, Wang Wangshi, to come to Shanghai to discuss the marriage. This was entirely a transactional arrangement, but Zhang was so overjoyed that he forgot his concerns and acted accordingly. A few days later, Zhu Dasheng suddenly arrived at Zhang's house with Wang Wangshi, who claimed that she did not want her daughter to marry Zhang. Zhang was greatly alarmed and tried to negotiate, which was noticed by a patrolman, who questioned them and arrested them all, bringing them to the First Precinct of the Sixth District. After interrogation, as they were about to be handed over, Zhang and Wang Wangshi agreed to get married after discussing it in the detention center. The police, seeing that the case had an unclear background and that marriage should not be treated as a commercial transaction, ordered that the police station could not resolve the matter and handed them over to the local court for investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>Wang Lisheng and Two Others Granted Release</p>
<p>Ma Haichao was robbed of 75 yuan on Dith Avenue on December 28th last year.

The robbers even fired shots when they robbed Wu's house, intending to kill the owner. Yesterday, the victims and witnesses were summoned, and the robbers were handed over to the provisional court. Judge Ge interrogated them. The police lawyer requested the withdrawal of charges against Wang Lisheng and two others. The court granted the request, ordering Wang Lisheng, Chen Jinmei, and Shen Liansheng to be released. The others were remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<p>When Feng Yuxiang betrayed the Central Government last summer, the Provisional Court, upon orders, sealed up the Northwest Bank's Shanghai financial institution, ordering the police to temporarily oversee all of its assets, pending instructions from Commander-in-Chief Jiang. Over half a year has passed, and the Supreme Command has not issued any instructions regarding the disposition of assets, so they remain under police custody. The police lawyer filed a petition in court the day before yesterday, seeking instructions on how to dispose of the bank's assets. Judge Gao instructed the lawyer that the court intended to submit another request to the Supreme Command regarding the disposition of assets and would notify the police upon receiving orders from the Command.

<p>Bu A'er and Two Chinese Constables Ignore Propriety</p>
<p>Around 8 PM last night, Bu A'er, a Shandong man who sells flatbread, went to Ai Hua Inn, located at 346 North Zhejiang Road in Chinese territory. The counter clerk, Mr. Huang, instructed the bellboy to take him upstairs, stating that the room rate was 1 jiao 5 fen. Bu insisted on staying downstairs and only wanted to pay 1 jiao. The landlady, seeing the anger on Bu's face, agreed. However, Bu then complained about the crowd downstairs and demanded the return of his room fee before leaving. Two patrol constables from the Huisi police station happened to pass by, and Bu falsely reported that the inn had beaten and evicted him. The two constables believed Bu's story and went to the inn to question them. Bu then punched and attacked the counter clerk, Mr. Huang, intending to drag him outside. The bellboy tried to dissuade him, but the constables aided Bu in his assault and even brandished their guns. Seeing this, the lodgers realized that this was Chinese territory and the concession police had no right to interfere. They locked the iron bars on the glass windows, intending to report the incident to nearby Chinese police via the back door. At this moment, Bu and the two constables forcefully pushed the windows, causing them to collapse, shattering the glass. The broken glass fell on Bu's head and face, causing him to bleed profusely. The two constables, seeing an opportunity, arrested Huang, the two bellboys, and Bu A'er, bringing them to the Huisi police station. The police chief, after learning that the incident occurred in Chinese territory, rebuked them all and instructed the two constables that the concession should not interfere in disputes that occur in Chinese territory to avoid misunderstandings and damaging relations. They were then released and left. By the time the Chinese police arrived, Bu A'er had already fled. The inn immediately reported the details of the incident to the Chinese police to be forwarded to the relevant Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

The clothes and other items in the chest were untouched, and none of his roommates had lost anything. Greatly alarmed, Xu immediately reported the incident to the dormitory director for investigation. However, no trace of the money could be found. You Shizhi, the principal of the school, believing the matter concerned the reputation of the entire school, sent a letter to the Seventh District Public Security Bureau the day before yesterday. District Chief Chen Youxin immediately dispatched detectives Yu Peifa and Tang Bingxiang to investigate Room 8 in the dormitory. They found no signs of forced entry on the doors, windows, or walls, and the clothing chest was intact, determining that the theft was not committed by an outsider but by an insider. They prepared a report and then summoned the victim and school officials Zhu Mingda and Lu Weishan to the station. District Officer Li questioned them. Xu testified that he was 22 years old and from Ningbo. He brought a total of 850 yuan when he came to Shanghai from his hometown. He deposited 250 yuan with his relative, Hong Xingji (living at 79 Huaxing Lane, Hongxingfang, Baoshan Road), lent 150 yuan to a friend from Hangzhou, Xu Xiaogong, spent 35 yuan on books, 110 yuan on clothing and miscellaneous expenses, and 105 yuan on tuition fees, leaving him with 220 yuan. He wrapped the money in paper and hid it in his chest. He checked the chest on the 12th and saw that the money was still there. However, when he checked again on the 14th, only the wrapping paper remained, and the money was gone. He then reported the incident to the dormitory director. There were four people in the room: Deng Zhongbang, Huang Kaihua, and Zhang Guohui, all from Guangdong. Zhang was arrested in Shanghai on the 8th for distributing reactionary leaflets and has been sent to the Suzhou High Court. Deng visited Zhang on the 13th. After discovering the theft on the 14th, Xu went to investigate but found that Zhang had been sent to Suzhou that day. Therefore, he does not know whether Deng went with him. The dormitory attendant in charge of the room is Zhu Mingda. Although Xu cannot say that he stole the money, he should be held responsible and requested an investigation. Zhu Mingda testified that he was 27 years old and from Xuzhou. He was in charge of eleven rooms, including the room where Mr. Xu and the others lived. There were many people coming and going, so he did not lock the doors, making it difficult to manage. Lu Weishan was called in to help, and Zhu always accompanied him when he went to the students' rooms, never letting him go alone. He did not know about the theft of Mr. Xu's money and asked for forgiveness. Lu Weishan testified that he was 29 years old and from Yangzhou. Zhu Mingda called him to help, and Zhu accompanied him when he went to the students' rooms. He did not know about the theft of Mr. Xu's money and asked for forgiveness. After reviewing the testimonies, District Officer Li believed that it was necessary to investigate whether Xu, a student who brought over 800 yuan, deposited and borrowed a large portion of it, was telling the truth. Furthermore, Zhang Guohui, a roommate, was arrested in Shanghai for distributing reactionary leaflets, and Deng Zhongbang did not avoid suspicion and visited him. Therefore, it was necessary to investigate whether Deng and Huang were involved. He reported the information to District Chief Chen, planning to go to Zhonggong School that night with District Officer Li and the original detectives, with the consent of the school's dormitory director, to search Room 8. Two letters from Xu Xiaogong of Hangzhou were found in the victim's chest, confirming that Xu had brought a large sum of money to prepare for mining and that the money borrowed from his friend was factual. Detectives were dispatched to investigate Hong Xingji's residence on Baoshan Road, and it was reported that 250 yuan had indeed been deposited there, confirming Xu's loss. In Deng Zhongbang's suitcase under his bed, a newly carved square seal was found, reading "Chapter of the Summer School of Fudan University" and a personal seal of "Li Denghui," as well as four wooden seals with the inscriptions "Mingsue," "Socialism," "ABB," and "Economic Problems in China." Deng claimed that the suitcase and its contents were left by his classmate, Liu Yaoxian, who lived in the Shanghai branch of the school. Huang Kaihua was found to be beyond suspicion. District Officer Li believed that the large number of seals found were reactionary and that the case was serious. He immediately took Deng and the seals back to the Seventh District Office for further investigation. Deng testified that he was 24 years old and from Guangdong. He did not know that Liu had left such seals in the suitcase and asked for investigation. After reviewing the testimony, District Officer Li immediately reported to the District Chief of the adjacent district, ordered the arrest of Zhu Mingda, who was related to the theft case, and released Lu Weishan. At the same time, he ordered the detectives to investigate and arrest the thieves and bring them to justice. The reactionary suspicion case was also assigned to detectives yesterday to arrest Liu Huixian for strict investigation, and a written report was submitted to the Public Security Bureau for review.</p>

<p>500 Yuan to Terminate the Marriage</p>
<p>Two-Way Payment for the Three-Year-Old Child</p>
<p>Through the introduction of a matchmaker, Chen Huifang was promised to He Longgen. They had not yet married but had already cohabited and had a son, who is now three years old. Chen Huifang repeatedly urged her husband to hold a formal wedding, but He not only refused but also abandoned her. Chen Huifang then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in court, requesting a divorce and compensation for maintenance expenses. After repeated summonses, the defendant claimed that he could not afford the marriage due to poverty. The court ruled that the marriage contract be terminated, that the child be returned to the defendant, and that the defendant pay the plaintiff 500 yuan in maintenance fees, with the plaintiff bearing the legal costs. As the enforcement date was approaching the day before yesterday, both parties were summoned to the court. The defendant paid the money, but the plaintiff did not send the child. The court ordered both parties to complete the payment.</p>

<p>Trying to Take Away Paramour with Handcuffs</p>
<p>Exposed and Sent to Court Together</p>
<p>Huang Kejia, a farmer from Yuepu in the northeast of Wusong, reported to the local Security Corps on the morning of the day before yesterday that his nephew's wife, Huang Gu'shi, had eloped on September 26th of last year and had been missing ever since. He had recently learned that Gu'shi had secretly returned to Yuepu and was hiding in her mother's house. He requested her arrest. After receiving the report, the Security Corps immediately sent personnel to arrest Huang Gu'shi. She testified that she was 22 years old and that her husband, Huang A'fo, worked in a cigarette factory in Shanghai. She had married A'fo three years ago through a matchmaker. However, due to discord between the couple, they often quarreled. She ran away to Wusong in a fit of anger and worked in a textile factory. She then went to Shanghai and was introduced to work as a domestic helper. In Shanghai, she met Chen Xuedi from a certain advertising company, who seduced her into an affair that had occurred more than once. Recently, she fell in love with Chen and wanted to be with him permanently, so she returned to Yuepu to discuss a solution with her mother to sever her relationship with her husband. However, in the midst of the questioning, two young men in Western-style suits, carrying a pair of handcuffs, arrived at the Security Corps, claiming to be detectives from the Shanghai police and requesting to take Gu'shi back. The Security Corps suspected that they were suspicious and detained them, finding a badge. One of them confessed to being Gu'shi's lover, Chen Xuedi, and the other, Qiu Ding, was a patrolman in the Second District of Shanghai Special City. After reviewing the testimony, the Security Corps believed that Chen Xuedi, having taken another man's wife, dared to impersonate a detective to take her away, which was extremely illegal. They sent them all to the Public Security Bureau, sending a written report to the Baoshan County Public Security Bureau for strict investigation. They also ordered Huang A'fo, Gu'shi's husband, to come to the station for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Wang Lanying Meets an Unscrupulous Man <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Huang Amao Utterly Destitute</p>
<p>Wang Lanying, a woman residing in the Laosanjing workshop in Pudong (and a party member), filed a lawsuit with the local court the other day, stating: "In the past, my parents arranged for me to marry Huang Amao, a Siyang native who worked as a matchmaker in Laosanjing, Pudong. It has been six or seven years now. However, Amao is addicted to opium and gambling, causing him to squander all the dowry I brought when I married. We have reached a point where we can't even afford to cook. My husband not only doesn't repent but also blames me for having bad luck and mistreats me. I had no choice but to work to support myself, which I have been doing for the past four years. The defendant not only doesn't show any compassion but constantly demands money from me. I am well aware of the principle of gender equality and therefore do not resent earning my own living. Recently, due to factory shutdowns, I have found it difficult to make a living, so I thought that my husband has a duty to support his wife. I returned home to seek a living, but to my surprise, there wasn't a grain of rice left in the house, and the defendant had pawned all my clothes. When I questioned him about it, I was severely beaten. I avoided him and returned after three days. Upon seeing me, the defendant still didn't let me go. Using rice as an excuse, he went out to a restaurant to fill his stomach. When I followed him, he dragged me back into the house and beat me again, causing further injuries. This is truly inhumane. I request an examination of my injuries and prosecution," etc. The prosecutor examined and confirmed that the injuries were real, ordered her to leave, and then immediately ordered the defendant to be summoned for investigation.</p>
<p>[P Reconciliation of Tang and Liu</p>
<p>Tang Senhe, a native of Taixian, Jiangbei, who lives on the Shanghai-Nanjing train line to make a living, resides in Datong Road, Zhabei. His wife, Ms. Liu, works in a silk factory and is quite beautiful. At the end of last year, she suddenly went missing. Shortly after, a man named Wang Zhaofu approached Tang to negotiate, saying that a certain Mr. Qin was willing to pay 120 yuan to take her abroad as her price, and begged Tang to give her up. Tang refused, leading to no results. Tang immediately filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Mr. Qin and Wang Zhaofu of colluding to hide his wife, etc. He was instructed to summon and detain Qin and others, and to await the arrest of Tang and Ms. Liu for questioning and verification. However, Tang and Ms. Liu stepped forward and hired a lawyer to file a personal lawsuit in the local court, requesting a divorce. On the tenth of this month, Judge Zhao Zhenhai held a hearing and repeatedly advised the plaintiff, Tang and Ms. Liu, to go out and reconcile. Meanwhile, Tang's father, Tang Shoushan, and mother, Tang Ying, dragged their daughter-in-law, Tang Liu, into the criminal division of the court. Prosecutor Liu Pingfan held a hearing and ordered the detained Wang Zhaofu and others to be interrogated. Tang Liu was handed back to her husband for custody, and Wang and others were released. It is reported that Tang has withdrawn the lawsuit from the criminal division, but the personal lawsuit has not been concluded. The other day, Judge Zhao held another hearing and ordered Tang Liu and Tang Senhe to appear in court. He asked, "Have you reconciled outside?" Tang Liu replied, "I have already returned home and am no longer pursuing the lawsuit. I was previously fooled by others and involved in a lawsuit with my husband. Now, I am grateful for my husband's understanding, and we have reconciled. At the last hearing, I was also given earnest advice by the presiding judge. I am not made of wood or stone, and I deeply regret my previous foolish actions. I am now willing to correct my past mistakes," etc. Tang Senhe stated, "My wife has now realized her mistake, and I will not pursue the past. I am still willing to reunite," etc. The judge then gave both parties some guidance and prepared a reconciliation record, ordering both parties to sign it. The court was then adjourned. Before the hearing, the two parties were whispering to each other in the waiting room, showing smiles from time to time, and were unusually intimate. When they left the court, they smiled at each other again. It can be seen that husband and wife are still husband and wife.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Du Jing Attempts Suicide by Jumping into the River but Fails <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>A Disappointed Boy Scout Instructor</p>
<p>Who is the "Old Gentleman" Mentioned in His Suicide Note?</p>
<p>Yesterday evening at 5:00 PM, the No. 5 ferry at the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, was carrying passengers across the river. A passenger wearing a tattered Boy Scout uniform suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide just a few feet away from the wharf. Fortunately, the water was shallow, and he was immediately rescued by the boatman and sent to the Water Police Station. He confessed that his name was Du Jing, 23 years old, from Guangdong. He used to be a Boy Scout instructor but is now unemployed. He felt that the environment was bad, so he attempted to commit suicide by jumping into the river. A copper badge was found on him, engraved with the words "Chinese Nationalist Party Boy Scout," and a suicide note. The envelope was addressed to Luo Jingshen Tang, side room of Mingfa Coal Store, Gonghe Lane, Dong Wuchang Road, Hongkou. The recipient was only addressed as "Old Gentleman" without specifying a name. The content roughly stated: "I cannot carry on the ancestral line and am deeply guilty. Even for one day, I cannot be allowed to remain in this world. I am oppressed by various environments and have no joy in life, so I have taken this drastic measure. However, who is without fault? To err is human, to forgive divine. I have realized this and am determined to correct my past mistakes and break the bad environment. But I am too guilty and cannot escape, leading to today's action." After reading it, the police chief asked who the "Old Gentleman" was. He replied that he was a relative but did not want to reveal his name, fearing that it would be published in the newspaper and affect his reputation. Since he had relatives in Shanghai, the police chief ordered detectives to investigate the address. However, there was no such person as "Old Gentleman" there, nor did anyone admit that Du Jing (the one who jumped into the river) was a relative. The detective returned to report. The police chief ordered the detective to send Du to Puxi and let him go home on his own.</p>

<p>Song Luquan Detained for Three Days for Using Violence</p>
<p>Song Jinhui, from Yancheng, accompanied by his mother, Song Wang, twisted his uncle, Song Luquan, and his wife, Song Wang, to the Fourth District General Office to file a complaint. Chief Jin inquired and Song Jinhui stated that he was 24 years old. He lives on Jiaotong Road. His father recently returned to his hometown because of business. I make a living by pushing a cart, but business is not good. The income is not enough to maintain expenses, so I borrowed a few dollars from my uncle to avoid starvation. Unexpectedly, my uncle was not sympathetic and refused to give me a penny, pushing my mother and me out the door. My mother is already in her sixties. After being insulted, she became extremely angry and argued with him. Unexpectedly, my uncle bullied me because I was poor and slapped my mother several times, and instigated his wife to beat my mother and me. My mother was injured in the waist and could not walk, so I twisted to the office to request an investigation. According to Song Wang's statement, it was roughly the same. According to Song Luquan's statement, the plaintiff's statement was completely untrue. My brother returned to his hometown a few days ago. I feel sorry for his poverty and provide him with food. Unexpectedly, my nephew is not satisfied. He insists that I make clothes for him. I think that my own economic situation is not very prosperous. I said that I would find a way after my brother came to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, he was dissatisfied and cursed at me. Because he was a junior, how could he be so rude, so I gave him a little education. However, his mother helped him and twisted me around. I used a little force, and his mother fell to the ground, pretending to be dead. After reviewing the statements, the director believed that both parties were relatives and there was no need for dispute, and Song Wang had no injuries. However, Song Luquan used violence and was detained for three days as a warning.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday. The hospital followed the proposal and routinely sent people to collect vagrants. They were still worried that people from all walks of life would not understand the truth and easily cause misunderstandings. Therefore, they sent a special letter to District Chief Jin of the Fourth District, asking him to notify all sub-offices that they should cooperate when they encounter admissions personnel entering the territory to avoid misunderstandings. Later, 63 people were admitted at Tanzhiwan, Dayangqiao, Jiaotong Road, etc., and 126 people were admitted at Longhua Gaochang Temple, etc. in Nanshi. They were all transported back to the hospital by car, and it was already after 5 o'clock. When they were collecting people along the way, the crowd blocked the road.

<p>The Nanjing Grand Theater on Avenue Edward VII in this city has now been completed and is scheduled to open tomorrow (Tuesday) at 9:00 PM. Its scale and facilities are the best in Shanghai in recent times. The theater can accommodate 1,600 spectators. It has cold air pipes in summer and hot air pipes in winter. The seats are spacious and the temperature is moderate, striving to ensure the comfort of the audience. It cost more than 300,000 yuan. It is conceivable how beautiful the architecture is. It is said that it was carefully planned by architect Fan Wenzhao.</p>
<p>Two boats came and asked Tang what goods he was carrying and where he was going. Tang saw that the two boats were also cargo ships and did not suspect anything, so he told them directly. Then the pirates from the two boats rushed out of the cabins, carrying guns and standing at the bow of the boats, ordering them to stop. Sheng Wenzhi knew and told Tang to retreat quickly to avoid danger. Unexpectedly, the pirate ship fired four or five shots, wounding two crew members, and the boat was also hit with holes. The crew of fourteen or fifteen people were panicked and had to stop the boat. About fifty or sixty pirates boarded the boat with guns and asked who the owner of the boat was. Sheng Wenzhi told them that the owner was not there. The pirates opened the cargo hold and saw that it was full of cargo. They searched the cabin and, seeing that there was no large sum of money, they forced them to drive to the Taihu Lake. They drove Sheng and the crew ashore, only leaving Tang Gengen to be held on the boat and taken away with the boat to Suzhou. After Sheng and others were driven ashore, the place was all mountains and forests, and it was dark. Fortunately, they had seventy or eighty dollars on them that were not searched. They hired a small boat to Xiangshan Wharf and stayed at a hotel. Yesterday, Sheng and six crew members came to Shanghai. There are still crew members left there to find out the whereabouts. Sheng reported all the cargo numbers and requested that the goods be valued at over 20,000 taels. He is now petitioning the government to strictly suppress the bandits.</p>

<p>Sheng Kunsheng, from Pudong, started by rowing a boat. In the past two years, he has purchased and built five or six new boats, specializing in carrying passengers and goods to various ports in Jiangsu and Zhejiang inland. All the boats are managed by others. Now he has purchased a large boat that can carry more than 2,000 dan of goods. The boat cost 18,000 yuan and was repaired in a new dock.

Sheng had not been on the boat once. Recently, because there was something going on in Baoying, Sheng took the boat to Baoying, so he went on the boat for convenience. The boat sailed to the border of Jiangsu and Anhui near Taihu Suzhou on the 17th of this month. A sailor from the sailing staff in front of the river was responsible for preparing the plan.

Unexpectedly, on December 14, Qian suddenly embezzled the huge sum of 1,967 yuan left over from the salaries paid to the workers in the yarn room of the factory and fled. After the board of directors of the factory learned about it, they reported it to the police station and requested an investigation. The other day, it was discovered that Qian was hiding in the Xinjilu Road in the city. Chinese and Western detectives rushed there and, together with the local Public Security Bureau, arrested Qian and took him to the Putuo Road Police Station for detention. His family was greatly panicked and immediately tried to raise about 1,300 yuan and return it to the factory. The remaining amount was to request the original recommender to take responsibility in order to reduce the crime. The next morning, the police station escorted Qian to the Provisional Court. The lawyer representing the factory appeared in court and explained the previous situation, requesting leniency. After Judge Luo interrogated the defendant, he was sentenced to three months in prison with leniency for being young and a first-time offender, and the embezzled money had already been returned, and he was given a two-year probation sentence in court.</p>

<p>[P Stealing Car Cushions, Each Detained for Five Days</p>
<p>Hu Yigui and Wang Dawangzi, both from Jiangbei, stole the seat cushions from the rickshaw pulled by Ma Arong in the French Concession the other day. Ma noticed it and the police arrested Hu and Wang and detained them in the police station. According to Hu's confession, he was instructed by Shen Xiaojiuzi to have people steal the cushions. The police chief ordered detectives to arrest Shen and bring him to justice. The plaintiff, Ma Arong, complained about the theft. When asked about Shen Xiaojiuzi's confession, he said that people have always pulled rickshaws to make a living. Because he was robbed of a seat cushion when he was pulling a rickshaw outside the other day, he could not afford to pay for it, so he asked his friends Hu Yigui and others to steal the cushions from Ma and return them to the rickshaw owner to avoid compensation. The judge sentenced the defendants to five days of detention each as a warning.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Artification of Southern European Christianity <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenxia</p>
<p>The morality of Christendom in Europe, though moderate and simple, is full of the superhuman doctrines of old Hebrew. However, when it comes to the Latin people of Southern Europe, who are as passionate as fire, with their wine and song, silk and steel, love and hate, their physical enjoyment, reckless and unyielding bravery, and the spirit of preferring sweetness first and bitterness later, preparing to roll into hell, are always impossible to soften, making it difficult for their souls to hope for heaven.</p>
<p>Southern Europe, near the Mediterranean, was the earliest place where the apostles preached the gospel. Logically, the development of Hebrew thought should naturally be more intense than in other places. But at the same time, we must also understand that the Mediterranean region is also the base and birthplace of Greek culture. When Christians gained power, although they relied on the power of the Roman Empire to completely destroy the surface of many Greek cultures, Greek thought had already penetrated deeply into people's hearts and could not be destroyed. Therefore, even if the Pope sits high in the Roman palace, and the citizens trample on the withered bones of ancient heroes and sing hymns of praise, the deep-rooted nature of Greek culture remains the same. Northern European Christian countries, such as Germany and the Netherlands, can be more practical in religious ceremonies. While there are old and new factions, the solidity of the foundation of Greek culture is also an important reason. Not only have the people of Southern Europe not been cooled down by Christianity, but they have also transformed the appearance of Catholicism into beautiful art. The (festivals) inherited by France, Italy, and Spain, the grand parades, and the city-wide carnivals, in the eyes of the ancient Hebrew judges, are truly more sinful than the golden calf worship at the foot of Mount Sinai.</p>
<p>The decadence and absurdity of the late Roman Empire naturally made the people tired of the reality of life, so the new atmosphere of Peter and Paul took the opportunity to enter and destroy the Roman Empire. However, this was only a temporary curiosity of mankind. How could a truly cultured country accommodate many people praying to the sky? So, in the end, magnificent temples had to be built, and artistic decorations had to be extremely elaborate.</p>
<p>In short, although the Hebrew spirit destroyed Rome, in the end, the Greek spirit of Rome still annihilated the Hebrew spirit.</p>
<p>The history of the struggle between the Greek and Hebrew ideas is certainly not so simple. However, in the end, the accomplishments of mankind in life are always indestructible barriers. Otherwise, art would have no way to exert its strengths when encountering religion.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Four Kinds of Tibetan Essentials, Volume One, Have Been Published <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>The China Inner Academy at No. 5 Park Road, Nanjing, has published the first volume of Tibetan Essentials. This publication takes essential Buddhist scriptures, collates them with Sanskrit and Tibetan versions, arranges the differences, and meticulously examines and determines the definitive edition. Furthermore, it provides summaries and subtle explanations, revealing reading methods, with a preface for each type, greatly opening the door of convenience, and is truly a valuable book for researchers. The volume contains twenty-five types, of which four have already been published, with the remainder to be published monthly. (1) *Upaya-prajna*, Tibetan Essentials Edition, printed in three volumes in imitation of the Song Dynasty edition. This book is the second section of the *Great Prajna Sutra*, the last twenty chapters, detailing the meaning of *upaya* as ultimate. Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka school is entirely based on this. Now it is published separately, with a summary and notes for easy reading.</p>
<p>(2) The Fifth Section of the *Great Prajna Sutra*, Tibetan Essentials Edition, printed in two volumes in imitation of the Song Dynasty edition. The *Great Prajna Sutra* has six hundred volumes, with the main meaning in the first five sections in five parts. This fifth section is a selection of the first three parts. Now it is specially published separately, with a summary and notes for easy reading. (3) *Sandhinirmochana Sutra*, Tibetan Essentials Edition, printed in one volume in imitation of the Song Dynasty edition. The correct path of Buddhism lies in the environment, practice, and result. This sutra discusses all three doors, with unparalleled simplicity. Now it is published, exploring the meaning of the sutra, with a summary at the beginning, and collating various Chinese and Tibetan translations, clarifying the difficult passages, making it feel more clear and easy to read. (4) *Mulamadhyamakakarika*, Tibetan Essentials Edition, printed in one volume in imitation of the Song Dynasty edition. This book was formerly the theory followed by the Madhyamaka school. Now it is published, adopting various Sanskrit and Tibetan commentaries, collating and revising over one hundred erroneous omissions, and summarizing the meanings of both Nagarjuna's and Asanga's Madhyamaka schools, with a special summary indicating the reading method. The writing is both coherent and organized, and the meaning is refined and insightful.</p>
<p>An appendix is provided below, outlining the editorial and collation methods of the Tibetan Essentials. The Great Canon of all dynasties has ten defects: 1. Lack of systematic organization, 2. Unsimplified apocryphal books, 3. Multiple translations of one book, 4. Difficult and obscure translations, 5. Translations distorting the original meaning, 6. Alteration and falsification of the original text, 7. Errors in the order of chapters, omissions, and misspellings, 8. Groundless speculation in writings, 9. Empty and sparse meaning in commentaries, 10. Tedious elaboration to fill in gaps. These are known as one disordered, two spurious, three repetitive, four obscure, five distorting, six falsifying, seven erroneous, eight speculative, nine empty, and ten verbose. With such a desolate path, how can one travel far? To show the thoroughfare to benefit scholars, this is why the Tibetan Essentials are being produced. An outline of the methods is as follows: 1. Based on the normative learning of the five Indias, creating a systematic compilation and arrangement, extracting the essence of the canon, classifying it according to type, first presenting the outline, then elaborating on the details, dividing it into six volumes, with the example of each volume being the same, from simple to complex, leading people to enlightenment, faith, understanding, practice, and upholding, so that they will not deviate, perhaps. 2. Different editions, different translations, and different texts, using one as the main, and selecting the best of the others, correcting errors and resolving doubts (examples are given below), striving to make the meaning clear and the writing smooth, so that the true face leaps out. 3. For different editions of texts, the Southern and Northern Song editions are the main ones. Errors and omissions in the Yuan and Ming dynasties and unauthorized revisions in the Korean canon are known by comparing Sanskrit and Tibetan texts. This edition does not lightly change anything without conclusive evidence, eliminating the careless and destructive errors of various editions. 4. Differing translations and texts are compared with old interpretations, selecting the best and combining commentaries. If they are the same, the more fluent text is taken. If they are different, the learning of both schools is preserved. As for those that are doubtful or erroneous, they are all deleted, not insisting on a fixed and complete text, as preserving antiquity. Four examples are briefly given to show its scope. Even the so-called finely engraved canon of today, such as the Japanese Taisho Canon, has hundreds of errors when its content is examined (examples are given below). This is because the learning is both high and profound, and the writing is also deep and refined. Westerners are not always able to interpret the meaning, and it is difficult for the Japanese to perform the writing. It is necessary to use the meticulous methods of Han and Qing scholars of classical studies in our country, and the refined and subtle thoughts of Song and Ming scholars exploring the truth, moistening it with eloquence, and regulating it with chapters and sentences, so that even though the mandarin orange tree is transplanted, its fruit does not change and the ultimate principle is clearly expressed. Today is not as good as the past, and versatile talents are rare and difficult to find. We are striving to meet the challenge, and with the support of many, the four kindnesses and three sufferings are forgotten, and we are resolutely doing it, regardless of our own crudeness.</p>
<h3 id="e184">The Story of World Literature (145) <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Written by John Macy, translated by Hu Zhongchi, USA</p>
<p>Chapter 38: French Prose in the 19th Century</p>
<p>The great critics of that era, friends or enemies of these Romantic writers and poets, but generally considered, and still considered, friends of the best in French literature, were Sainte-Beuve. His importance is largely limited to France. Criticism is a form of writing that does not directly address areas far from people's interests in literature. There are few critics who are internationally important. In fact, it can be said that critics have little reputation outside their own country. Sainte-Beuve influenced Matthew Arnold and other English critics, and probably all literary critics in Europe learned from him. His great achievement was to give the French, and the world, a clear interpretation of French literature. However, the world does not read criticism. Some of Sainte-Beuve's essays have been translated into English, but he remains a closed book to those who do not read French. For those who read French, he is not only an open book, but also the opener of the books of all French literature before him, and often of his contemporaries who were misjudged by him (such as Balzac). However, in general, he observed with the wise and direct light of criticism. After Sainte-Beuve, no literate Frenchman had an excuse for not understanding his country's literature, and any foreigner who groped for the best things in French literature would not have a better way than to follow Sainte-Beuve's guidance.</p>
<p>The rational and critical aspect of the French spirit is probably its most powerful aspect. Although France has literary and artistic giants in all forms, it is manifested in Ernest Renan and H.A. Taine. Renan is best known for his *Life of Jesus*, a skeptical and pious work. Like all books on religious issues, it became material for controversy. Christians did not like the book, and pagans used it in a way that Renan did not expect. Renan himself made the problem even more complicated by denying any interest in literature. In his own view, he was a seeker of truth who had no concern for style, a historian. However, literature retaliates with forgiveness, and in *Life of Jesus*, one sees a book that, whether or not it is analytically beautiful or (scientifically) historical, is undeniably a work of art. It is an explanation and adaptation of the New Testament, realistically depicted in rich colors. Realistic depiction, because most of the book was written by Renan in Syria, in the middle of that scene. He aspired to be a historian, critic, philosopher, and orientalist. He was a historical artist. People deceive themselves and write things that are better than they know, and literature, that mysterious and incomprehensible goddess, adopts them.</p>
<p>Like Renan, H.A. Taine regarded himself more as a scientific historian and logician than as a literary scholar. In the second half of the 19th century, the scientific spirit dominated all fields of thought. The word "(scientific)" and the ideas or methods it represented were somewhat overused. There was a science of all human activities, even erotic affairs. This movement was a reaction to the loose thinking of the Romantic era, and Taine was the leader of this movement in France. He believed that for any person of genius, whether a politician or a poet, if we know for sure his race, his era, his social affairs, and his dominating ability, we can explain him. Under this formula, criticism largely becomes a matter of biography and history. Later, critics who felt that this did not fully explain human genius raised objections to Taine's method. In fact, Taine himself was a poet beyond what he knew. In his essays, his aesthetic enthusiasm often transported him out of that declared principle. For English readers, his value is immeasurable, because his great work *History of English Literature* can never be completely replaced by subsequent research. And it is extremely illuminating to look at English literature from the perspective of a great Frenchman. The English translation is excellent.</p>
<p>Sadness is usually regarded as something unique to the Romantic temperament. However, in France, those who praised the joy of life were the Romanticists such as Hugo, George Sand, and Dumas, while those who were considered sad and world-weary were the rationalist realists. Taine viewed humanity with almost gloomy resignation, and the novelists Flaubert, Maupassant, and Zola, who followed Balzac, shared Taine's dark mood. This was not due to his influence, but because of the atmosphere of the time, partly because the war of 1870 was dark.</p>
<p>Gustave Flaubert, with cold contempt, and at the same time with the sharp clairvoyant wisdom that peered into human life, and with a view of life made mature by satire that did not make us laugh, made his books difficult to popularize widely even in his own country. However, for readers interested in the art of writing, Flaubert is the pinnacle of perfection. He worked for as long as a week on just one page, striving to find the right words. And the result was not decorative, exaggerated, or artificial, but precise, compliant, and the words were so natural that they seemed to have discovered themselves. His most famous novel is *Madame Bovary*, a description of a frail woman and her licentious love affair with ordinary people in a monotonous town. Such a description seems unmoved, but it is a very great novel, not only for its complete style, but also for its faithfulness to the characters. The story is made of non-heroic, even uninteresting material, but the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and the progress of the story is as inevitable as the tide. Although it is difficult to reproduce Flaubert's (appropriate words), the sense of progress and truth is not lost in translation (there is a complete English translation).</p>

Compared with the popular clear and secret code telegraph books, it has been improved a lot. In addition to single characters, there are single codes for numbers up to 2,000. In addition, there are about 1,500 phrases, and one code can represent two or more characters. Ordinary and specialized terms are collected in detail. In addition, there is a difficult character search table containing about 1,000 characters, arranged according to the number of strokes, to avoid difficulty in selecting telegraphs. There is also a list of registered telegraph addresses of Shanghai commercial firms, totaling 1,500 companies, for the convenience of out-of-town reporting and inspection. The address and name of the recipient are only charged as one character, saving a lot of money. There are also more than 300 major domestic place names and 100 foreign place names, all replaced with single codes. Chemical element names and newly created characters are added to the supplement, and a Chinese-English comparison table is attached. The rhyme code for the date and the abbreviation table for province names are placed under the telegraph translation characters to save time. At the end are attached multiple code tables and index tables. Looking at the whole book, the system is rigorous, and the application is extremely convenient. In addition, the organizational law and compilation examples are published at the beginning of the book, so that people can become familiar with it in a short time and avoid mistakes. It is a practical book for the business community. The book is fourteen inches high and eight and a half inches wide, and is finely printed on a thick volume of Daolin paper. The price is one yuan per book, including domestic and foreign postage. Registration costs an additional six cents. The publisher is the New Zhong Engineering Company at No. 7 Ningbo Road, Jiangxi Road Intersection, Shanghai.</p>
