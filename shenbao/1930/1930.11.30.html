<h3>江大足球賽</h3>
<p>曁南一對零勝光華交大復旦一對一成和局　　（一）曁南光華之役</p>
<p>曁南大學足球隊昨日下午三時在光華大學作江大錦標賽雙方拉拉隊歡呼若狂開球三十分鐘後曁南童榮文得戴麟經之球踢入一球上半時告終一時零曁南勝下半時互無勝負但球常在光華方面而曁南技術實較光華多多惜曁南前鋒脚頭不準且習慣在草地作戰而今光華球塲係硬地且不平坦致英雄無用武</p>
<p>之地耳</p>
<h3>球賽趣聞</h3>
<p>（中外通訊社）往年光華到曁南比球雖兩軍相角而謙遜有加曁南校前必大書（歡迎光華大學球員）字樣以敦睦友誼也昨日曁南來襲光華光華居於地主以逸代勞助威團訓練嫻熟五光十色亦太不客氣居然在大廳前書一聯（打倒南蠻不費吹灰之力）（克服眞茹全憑脚上功夫）曁南大隊人馬莫不氣憤塡膺但忍氣呑聲抱爲政不在多言主義交綏後曁南造紀錄即有一員高呼曰（未倒南强已盡吃乳之力）（克服眞茹豈是吹牛功夫）可謂謔甚迨散場後曁南果以一比零獲勝於是拉拉隊及校工會鑼鼓班吹吹打打耀武揚威走出光華校門又見光華對面球塲懸有一聯（隊如火如荼燒到黑炭團欒灰爐二軍無神無氣拉住黄包車回眞茹）蓋以光華自大狂譏曁南必敗回也於是又有一惡作劇者就其聯改易而呼曰（隊如火如荼不敵曁南利害敎小子輩凄凄慘慘敗大西）（指敗在大西路也）（軍有神有氣拉住光華汽車送太爺們愜愜意意回眞茹）只見光華有一千金小姐從後奔來慰其呢友云還好只輸一只没啥大難爲情呢</p>
<h3>（二）交大復旦之戰</h3>
<p>交通大學與復旦大學昨日下午二時半在交大球塲作江大足球賽結果一對一和局裁判員何春輝</p>
<p>平分秋色　復旦迎日開球向左進探不利交大回攻亦未得手如是者往返十餘次都半途中止太致交大前鋒活潑善攻但苦於射門欠準徒然浪費機遇復旦打擊有力惟不能得中衛線之恊助卒至孤軍被困以雙方内衛論交大王恭琛脚頭堅硬位置適當有大將軍八面威風之氣慨鳴鐘三下交大楊惺華傳交門前左内鋒萬冕面對空門射之過野交臂失機幸於四分鐘後交大再度進攻前鋒得勢一擁入中鋒劉希孟碰然一脚首開紀錄六分鐘後復旦振臂一呼大舉反攻迫得角球繼由左前衛張維新傳交左翼李彬李挑送合度球向牌前落下其時交大内衛注神於嚴監敵方不料球正墮於内衛之背而落其旁復旦姚永炳順水推船完成大功雙方各得一球後未幾上半局即行告終</p>
<p>相持不下下半局之初二軍戰略散漫均有疲乏狀態殆至十分鐘後復旦前鋒頗有合作工夫數度進攻頗含有危險成份又十分鐘後交大得勢内衛二人駐立中區線上遙加應援未幾李北良替沈觀瀾作戰極盡厥職最後十五分鐘内復旦交大先後遇險初交大前鋒徘徊於復旦門前久而久之终入歧路復旦則於憂患交迫之中作驚人之舉一瀉千里立成角球球落門前雙軍死爭之際突見守門一拳擊出脫離危險不久銀笛聲起宣告終了結果各得一球成和局</p>

<h3>西青籃球昨賽結果</h3>

<p>海賊勝紅隊　開賽時紅隊曾以四比二占優惟以後則成一面倒之形勢上半時爲二十一比十結果爲四十三比十七海賊勝史密斯得分最多海賊之表演未見出色故形勢未見吃緊有趣裁判員邵驥與萬福</p>

<p>青光勝海盜　青光昨晚戰來頗有得心應手之妙頑强之海盜祇有甘拜下風且爲一面倒之形勢上半時青光以十七比三佔先下半時起海盜力圖反攻形勢頓轉平均然海盜始終無超勝之勢結果青光以三十八比二十一大勝裁判員徐振東青光談達鏵陳華駱二人共得三十分</p>

<p>華東勝也是最後一幕華東對也是頗引起觀者之興趣蓋名震一時之華東操得勝券是在意中然結果華東僅勝三分比數爲三十二比二十九殊出人意料也上半時爲一面倒之局面華東以二十比八居前下半時中也是努力奮鬥頗見得心應手華東竟以十二比二十一敗但總結果華東仍勝三分昨晚華東陣線頗含有嘗試意味蓋以梁國權任中鋒而以陸鍾恩任前鋒以凌傳二將輪流作輔如此支配尙屬初次亦有可取之處裁判員貝利司</p>

<h3>兩江中國之團體表演</h3>
<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>中國體育學校與兩江女子體育學校一以二十四週年紀念一以十週年紀念開聯合運動會於中華足球塲昨爲開幕之第一日舉行團體表演節目凡十有八起本報敎育新聞攔已疊誌之茲取消息所未詳者及所感瑣屑有趣之事記以實本談俾未得觀光者亦能于此得其大槪若并敎育消息讀之或將感到有如身歷其境之興味歟</p>
<p>兩江同學戴白帽穿白衣黑袴足登白鞋著白襪襪長統及股之半故全身白多於黑胸前斜綴兩江兩字色鮮紅周身色采調和合以各同學固有之健康美蓋益顯美觀開幕時兩校同學環行全塲一周導以兩校合编之樂隊觀衆見女同學撃鼓吹笛有謂未曾前見者而尤以司大鼓者體特肥碩爲觀衆所注意環行時兩江在光中國在後因有觀衆曰此與陸禮華女士爲是會之長同爲女權伸張之朕兆歟亦一時佳話也</p>
<p>唱黨歌運動會歌時以中國人數少於兩江故祗聞兩江歌聲勁銳因是有竊謂男學生不會唱歌者迨表演觀迎操中國同學忽放聲呼唱厥聲粗豪似有意欲與勁銳之一二三四二二三四爭雄一塲者</p>
<p>中國同學大都體段偉岸故於其表演舞蹈時頗博得觀衆歡笑且臨時贈以大小囡之雅號於此我又見一部分人土對於體育一事至今尙不過以爲（小囡白相）而已則體育之積極的提倡洵爲今是不容或緩之務矣</p>
<p>本埠各報館之記者在塲攝影甚勤如中國之雙人多人之機巧運動皆爲攝入鏡箱預料最近一二期書報上當添不少新頴名貴之作品</p>
<p>是日觀衆滿坐四周看臺因大多御深色衣服故遠望但見黑色頗與兩江之白相映成趣</p>
<h3>書小圓桌會議之趣聞</h3>
<p>— 冰心</p>
<p>印度有大圓桌會議吾友彭城君乃有小圓桌會議而此小圓桌之會議且有不少之趣聞至今猶未能正式開議此事彭城君秘而不宣而爲其介弟所洩余以其趣不傷雅已取得同意許爲披露但戒我不得以眞姓名揭　之耳爰書其經過以資談動</p>
<p>動議之緣起彭城以慘綠少年處境繁　春花秋月到處留情惟向不涉跡勾欄所交皆色藝可觀之小家碧玉介弟年亦十七阿兄敎戒頗嚴雖不敢違意不能無怏怏一日弟語嫂曰阿兄女友極多聚之可滿一圓桌妬爲人類之特性女子尤甚夫人因再三致詰必欲彭城君說明人數及姓名且曰男子拈花惹草勢雖杜絶然亦不可太濫請假一餐館聚羣芳於一桌我爲選尤美者二人置之貳室餘當謝絶彭城笑置之不肯就範知結果之未必良好也</p>
<p>召集之困難　旬日以來彭城經夫人之軟語嗔顏督促糾纏於枕席間不得已允召所交者六人約期會於某西餐室然此六人者平日亦各避面皆不知我之外尙有人在也彭城皆紿以親串相會邀之作陪但座有夫人則不敢隠六人者　即以此點爲拒絶參加之根據夫人又怪其不應明言有我於是召集益感困難</p>
<p>最近之變化　最近夫人使彭城分告六人謂不使夫人在座又約臨時指夫人爲中表又以西餐長桌諦視不眞改就某川菜館作小圓桌之聚彭城不能崛强一一就範六人中之五人皆許之矣其一人獨曰會親串何必須我參加又謂餐室無端易地旣有夫人在座何以忽然能使避席遂疑此會非澠池必鴻門堅决不久彭城遂大窘於此小圓桌之會議云</p>

<h3>王爾德未著的傑作</h3>
<p>— 汪倜然</p>
<p>台文屈列先生及夫人</p>
<p>本月三十日是王爾德底三十週年忌辰我們這篇文章算是一個小小的紀念</p>
<p>讀過王爾德劇本的人大槪是很容易上癮覺得像他那樣的妙語和機伶眞很難在别處找到但是王爾德底劇本雖然不算少也只有七部這七部似乎不夠過癮本來他的劇本應該是一共有八部但是最後的那一部王爾德雖然已經在不同的時候把版權賣給一個出版家和一個戲子他都始終没有寫了出來所以這部至多只好算是半部</p>
<p>這半部劇本王爾德早已胸有成竹只不過遲末寫所以他的朋友們都曉得他有這麽樣的一個劇本王爾德到了没錢的時候也就拿這未產生的孩子押給别人弄點錢用用到了他去世前三四個月的時候這個劇三底名氣已經很大巴黎和倫敦的文藝界有不少人知道這件事但是王爾德却是又窮又懶總是不肯把這劇本寫了出來那時他是住在巴黎潦到不堪湊巧他的老朋友弗蘭克哈列司（Frank　Harris）也到了巴黎經營着商業上的事情是一個闊綽朋友王爾德就去拜望他同時不必說是想設法找點錢用用可是不幸得很哈列司恰巧投資失敗經濟非常困窘自已的錢自已都不夠用所以對於王爾德底要求實在是無力應命但王爾德還是逼着他要錢因之他就勸王爾德把他那個劇本寫出來劇本一公演他不是就有錢用了麽但那時候的王爾德要的是錢不是勸告所以他就回答一不弗蘭克那個劇本我是再也不寫的了你拿了去你自已去寫吧我把這劇本給你）這話說得自然很慷慨其實目的還是希望對方也慷慨一下但是哈列司那時候却並不慷慨他却照做生意的辦法（哈列司是一個什麽事業都做的文藝家）來了個回答他提議和王爾德（合著）這個劇本辦法是利益均沾王爾德寫第一幕哈列司寫第二幕第三兩幕最後的第四幕是兩人合作王爾德是答應了但這答應當然不是願意和别人全着他那最後的傑作不過是想藉此和哈列司混混樂得讓哈列司作東道自已好來過上闊綽安閒的生活可是他算計錯了哈列司事情很多不能長久躭擱在巴黎他是就要回到美國去這個情形當然使王爾德很失望不過後來終於說妥了哈列司回到英國寫好了二三兩幕送給王爾德看王爾德修改之後寫第一幕然後兩人來合寫第四幕哈列司是熱心得很大槪他認定這是一件名利雙收的事情他不久就寫好了第二幕第三兩幕寫到巴黎去給王爾德過目但王爾德却一點也不熱心他氣狠狠地回了一封信說不行第二幕寫得太長了在（頂點）之後不應再來一個（頂點一第三幕也不行主人公底獨白太長了用獨白已經是一種陳腐的編劇技術他的批評是對的但是他的態度太冷淡了他連一個字也不寫他那應該寫好的第一幕當然是没有着手於是弗蘭克哈列司氣起來了心裏是覺得（難道你王爾德不肯寫我就不寫了麽）他就寫完了這個劇本這時候這兩位朋友已經差不了翻了臉王爾德駡哈列司愉竊他的作品哈列司當然不承認不過中心而論哈列司編成的（治文屈列先生及夫人）Mr.　and　Mrs.　Day　entry雖然第二幕第四幕和王爾德底本意不同但全劇底結構情節到底是根據的王爾底腹稿所以我們至多祇能當它是哈列司所寫的王爾德底劇本這和王爾德底親筆作品自然不同况且這個劇本到了哈列事手裏就夑成凡俗的東西和王爾德本來所要寫的相差很遠據哈列司底書記貝爾（T.　H.　Bell）在美國（讀書人）雜誌上所說的看來王爾德底本來結構不但遠勝於哈列司底改作並且假如寫出來的話簡直可以算是王爾德生平最好的劇本所以他至死没有把這劇本寫出來實在是可惜</p>
<p>現在撇過哈列司底改作不談我們來說一說王爾德底這部嘴裏常常談到却是始終未寫的（台文屈列先生及夫人）不過我們在這兒所說的當然只是據王爾德所談起的全劇底梗槪並不是節述原文所以不免缺少精采</p>
<p>第一幕是一塲社交情景在台文屈列先生及夫人底家裏婦女們閒談着不絶的妙語雋句這一幕雖是作爲介紹劇中人物之用但在王爾德寫起來必然是閃耀着他那獨具的說話的天才創造出許多絶妙的雋句來的台文屈列夫人是年輕·聰慧受過良好敎育而富於理想台文屈列年紀比她大些體格强壯是一個體育家頭腦是清楚的不過带點玩世的態度他很能亨受生活自已有這樣一個嬌妻覺得很得意可是却也很留心到别的什麽漂亮女人此外是藍斯菲先生一個較年青的人瘦削高大沉靜謙恭性格並不堅决是台文屈列夫人底一位老朋友這一幕底末尾是台文屈列和藍斯菲兩人底談話台文屈列提到他缺少現錢可週轉不靈藍斯菲就自動地借了一筆錢給他台文屈列說多謝老弟）</p>
<p>第二幕時間比第一幕稍遲是傍晚時候在台文屈列家裏的書齋裏台文屈列夫人走入書齋身體倦乏精神沮喪她先坐了下來後來躺在一個榻上旋暗了燈光蘇末司夫人進來這位蘇夫人就是台文屈列在第一幕裏所着眼的（漂亮女人）台文屈列跟着走了進來因爲台文屈列夫人是在燈光暗處而且一半被一個屏風遮住所以他們没有看見她蘇夫人正在經濟困窘之中可是不敢給她的丈夫喬治爵士知道台文屈列就告訴她說他有錢可以借給她蘇夫人於是放心了讓他做了點戀愛的把戲很迫切的接受了他的錢但她立刻就焦灼起來急於想走出去以免被别人看見可是台文屈列却正在得意的時候繼續着他那表示愛情的工作正在這當兒門上有了打門的聲音台文屈列爲小心起見是預先將門鎖上了的蘇夫人就急壤了說道（這是我男人我男人要進來了怎樣好呢）她想找出逃走的路可是無路可逃打門聲又起這次是更響而且带着命令的口氣出路是没有的他們是被捉住的了外面喬治爵士底聲音又嚴厲又堅决地說（開開門來我知道我女人是在裏面假如不開門我就打破門進來）</p>
<p>正在這（危急之秋）呌這一對男女大吃一驚的是台文屈列夫人急然站起身來走到門邊開開了門說道（啊自然哪喬治爵士你要進來就請進來吧）喬治爵士見了她當然大爲驚詫他幾乎不相信他的眼睛和耳朶他懷着肚皮氣狠定了心而來以爲總捉住了他的女人了誰知半路裏跑出來一個程咬金他只好很難爲情地道個歉臂挽着他妻子去了）這是第二幕</p>
<p>在第三幕底開塲我們看見藍斯菲在他的房間一個人獨白着他一向是愛着台文屈列夫人的但是他比她年輕他我台文屈列比較起來只好算是個小孩不比台文屈列性格剛强要什麽就做什麽所以台夫人終於被他得去但現在她離開了台文屈列了不願和他再做夫妻因此這懦弱的藍斯菲女痛苦又慌張了最後他還是决定立刻動身到外国去置身局外</p>
<p>台文屈列進來他們向來是好朋友所以這次見面並不翻臉不過藍斯菲覺得有點窘台文屈列承認自已的行爲不對他不能怪他的夫人要離開他他不知道他夫人在那兒但是他想和她通消息要勸她回家去並且答應他自此以後一定安分守已藍斯菲聽了這話不大相信他躊躇起來於是台文屈列和他辯論他說一她假如回來你知道她並不受任何拘束她只是给我一個洗心從善的機會罷了藍斯菲顯然是不很相信他的話但最後到底是台文屈列勝利了藍斯菲答應替他傳這個信於是他們握手而别</p>
<p>他剛走出台文屈列夫人就進來了和藍斯菲談着天藍斯菲就很窘拙却很忠實地說到了台文屈列底提議台文屈列夫人就很生氣了不她一定不回去她是經過鄭重的考慮才如此的她决不繼續着她的一生無謂地毁壞了這次的事情不是頭一次了　　開這件事吧約翰不要再談到了你自已怎樣呢你計劃着什麽呢這詐多衣箱是做什麽的你带了這些箱子要到什麽地方去）約翰就很呑吐地回答說他要到非洲去（到菲洲去爲什麽是菲洲呢一約翰就又很慌張很呑吐地勉强解釋着但他的解釋她都拒絶了（約翰你告訴我老實話你是否要到菲洲去來避開我）於是約翰只好屈服了第三幕充</p>
<p>第四幕　這對人是到了歐洲大陸底某冷僻地方避入耳目地圃居着以前台文屈列是不知道他們的行踪但藍斯菲聽說他現在已經發覺了他們的地址正在追尋他們而且據說他罰誓要置藍斯菲於死地他說他們的事情是在他和藍斯菲會晤的時候就安排好了的所以藍斯菲是一個欺友賣友的人…這是很壞的消息但是台文屈列夫人提議他們再雙雙逃赴别處的時候藍斯菲却斷然拒絶了他以爲這是懦怯的表示所以非等着不可同時還有一個原因就是他們的孩子將要產生了她是不能再受旅行之苦的這樣的勸說過她之後他就一個人出去散步了</p>
<p>果然台文屈列出現了她是吃驚但她大胆地對付着他他終於改換了凶暴的態度用温和的情狀言語勸她再給他一個自新的機會勸她和他回去但她斷然拒絶了她决不回去她要求遠和她所愛的人在一起了台文屈列到了這裏耐不住了又發起脾氣來說是假如遇見了藍斯菲他一定要用槍打死他像打死一條狗一樣說時就氣狠狠地出去了這邊他一走了台文屈列夫人就披上外套想找到她的愛人呌他趕快逃避但是她不知道他是劉哪兒去的她自已又不能多走路她無法可想只好倒身在榻上在驚恐之中戰慄者</p>
<p>忽然一聲槍響</p>
<p>她驚呼一聲跳了起來發狂地埋怨自已不該不出去警告自已的愛人以致他慘遭毒手正在這時候一個女待從走廊上跑過來驚呼着台文屈到夫人連忙抓住了她問她道一這是什麽你看見了什麽是誰告訴我告訴我告訴我你見了什麽女待告訴她說是（八號裏新來的那位英國先生打死了别一位先生）她聽見這話是急昏了但是這時候藍斯菲刦很鎭靜地走了進來抱住了她（啊·約翰·約翰·眞的是你麽我聽見一聲槍響哩眞有一聲槍響是不是呢可是約翰打死的是誰呢難道是）</p>
<p>（是的正是台文屈列）</p>
<p>（怎麽他自殺了麽）</p>
<p>（不）</p>
<p>（啊約翰約翰難道是你打死了他麽）</p>
<p>（不）</p>
<p>（那末是誰放的那一槍呢）</p>

<p>Shang Zhen Strongly Opposes Sun's Troops Returning to Gansu</p>

Last year, when Liu was in Nanjing, the Central Government provided the Northwest Army with a large amount of financial aid, hoping that the Northwest would cooperate thoroughly with the Central Government to engage in construction. However, the result was the opposite. Now that Liu sincerely leans towards the Central Government, he may contribute to solving the problem of the remaining Northwest troops. The Central Government still maintains leniency and accommodates him. Before Chiang and Zhang leave Nanjing, a solution may be found. (29th Dispatch)</p>

Shang also opposes this. The current exit route of the cabinet depends entirely on whether the route taken by Feng through Mongolia is safe. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Breaking the Economic Impasse (3)</h3>
<p>To break the economic impasse, the first requirement is a solution. However, given the current situation, even considering the unemployment problem, the desire to sell off unemployment to the colonies cannot succeed as the colonies themselves are seeking self-government and independence, and all are preoccupied with seeking a livelihood for themselves. How can they accommodate this large number of unemployed people? To seek relief in various localities, the economies of these localities are already so stretched, and the central government's financial resources are exhausted. The question is, how far will this trend of economic decline go, and to what extent will the trend of unemployment reach? It is impossible to predict in the short term, and the unemployment situation in various places is different and changes with the times. Given this situation, it is truly difficult to find a suitable solution. Britain has devoted the most effort to relief methods, and all aspects have been deeply researched, but the results have been largely failures. Japan, in the absence of a solution, has recently decided to issue public bonds to maintain various industries or provide subsidies to avoid temporary hardship. This may not be without some effect, but the supplement is very small in this turbulent and rapid trend, and its impact on the finances after the gold embargo is very large. Opponents attack the government with this, which is in fact a part of the reason. However, if they insist on a no-debt raising policy and seek other sources of relief funding, then I ask, can taxes not be reduced but increased? Can military spending be reduced rather than expanded? Can all austerity policies be shrunk further? Therefore, apart from raising debt, there is indeed no solution. The situation in Japan is like this, and other countries each have other difficulties. Although the financial resources of the United States are not exhausted, they are just as helpless with this unemployment problem. This is truly a difficult situation unprecedented in the world for thousands of years. Can those who merely seek the benefit of one country and are complacent about one issue of commerce break through it?</p>

Except for Liu Diankan and Chen Nengfen, who support Deng, the classmates faction did not want to support Deng and advocated returning to the command of Li Qixiang. The overall maintenance of the North Route is still maintained. As for Li's attitude, it is consistent with Yang Zihui. Three measures were decided on for Luo's troops: 1. Do everything possible to prevent division and maintain the overall strength. 2. Since Luo's generals have requested their return, Li will temporarily compile them and unite with Yang and Li's troops to consolidate the North Route. 3. Guarantee the safety of Luo Zezhou. (29th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Frequent Natural Disasters in Japan</h3>
<p>Ground Cracks in Toyama Prefecture</p>
<p>Dikes in Shimoda at Risk of Collapse</p>
<p>Tanna Basin Proven to Be a Fault Line</p>
<p>The 29th, Electric News, Toyama Electric - Centered in Himi County, Toyama Prefecture, a rare major ground crack occurred on the morning of the 28th in areas including Funo County and Shimo-Niikawa County. Ground cracks of two to three feet and faults of about eight feet were observed. The most severely affected were areas such as Nyora Village in Himi Town. Residents in the vicinity are successively preparing to evacuate. There is a risk of collapse of the Shimoda River dikes, and vigilance is currently underway. However, as of now, there have been no reported injuries to people or livestock.</p>
<p>The 29th, Electric News, Toyama Electric - Ground subsidence has occurred in the three counties of Himi, Funo, and Shimo-Niikawa, as previously reported. The most severely affected area is Nyora Village in Himi County. In this village, large cedar trees have been broken from their roots, and a section of the prefectural road has collapsed, with a width of more than two jo (approximately 6 meters) and a depth of one jo and two chi (approximately 3.6 meters), completely disrupting traffic. Houses have tilted and collapsed on the ground, with cracks of more than twenty feet appearing in the ground. Numerous large cracks run both vertically and horizontally, some with a depth of one chi (approximately 0.3 meters), as well as large fault lines of eight feet, resembling a giant maw of the earth goddess, ready to swallow humans and animals, a truly bizarre and tragic sight. Residents, having recently experienced earthquakes, are now facing this new disaster and are in extreme fear, successively evacuating to other places. The tragic ground subsidence has spread from the twenty-four cho (approximately 24 hectares) and two tan (approximately 0.2 hectares) of Nyora Village in Himi County, affecting a wide area. The cause is attributed to the continuous rainfall, unique to the Hokuriku region, affecting the weakest terrain of the Tertiary layer.</p>
<p>The 29th, Electric News, Tokyo Electric - Mr. Kokutomi, a technician from the Central Meteorological Observatory, and his team, discovered a large fault line stretching ten thousand chi (approximately 3 kilometers) from the west entrance of the Tanna Tunnel when they investigated the epicenter yesterday. As a result of this discovery, the conventional geological theories of the Tanna Basin, such as the submerged layer theory and the volcanic crater theory, have been disproven by this earthquake and it is now definitively proven to be a fault line. However, the nature of this fault line and when it began to be active are unknown. Whether the Tanna Tunnel construction can continue is highly questionable. In yesterday's cabinet meeting, there were those who advocated for the termination of the Tanna Tunnel construction, stating that there is absolutely no need to place Japan's most important transportation artery on a tunnel with minimal safety merely to shorten the distance by a small amount. As a result, it was decided to conduct further careful academic research.</p>
<p>The 29th, Electric News, Tokyo Electric - According to investigations by the Shizuoka Prefectural Office, the confirmed earthquake damage throughout Shizuoka Prefecture amounts to 17 million yen. Including all damages, it is estimated to be over 20 million yen.</p>
<h3>U.S. Short Session of Congress</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Convene Tomorrow</p>
<p>The 28th, Associated Press, Washington - The short session of Congress is about to open on December 1st. The volume of proposals is expected to be unprecedented in recent years. The Seventy-First Congress's previous session saw a total of 14,047 proposals. The committees considered 2,066 cases, and only 540 public laws and 281 private laws were passed and promulgated. Those unfamiliar with the inner workings of Congress might be dissatisfied, but they are unaware of the difficult procedures involved in passing a single bill.</p>
<p>The 28th, Associated Press, Washington - The cases to be included on the agenda of the upcoming Seventy-First Congress's short session have close ties with various countries across the Pacific. China, Japan, the Philippines, and Samoa will all be affected to varying degrees. The first is the Pittman report on the investigation of trade with China and the silver tide. As for Japan, they hope for a more lenient approach to Japanese immigration in the 1924 immigration restriction laws, as the chairman of the House Immigration Committee expressed such a view during the last session. The Philippines is paying close attention to the Hawes bill for the gradual autonomy of the Philippines and the selection of a new Deputy Governor-General of the Philippines.</p>
<p>The 28th, Associated Press, Washington - President Hoover has submitted the Root proposal to join the World Court to the Senate for discussion during the short session next week. However, in addition to submitting the proposal, Hoover did not add any comments urging its swift passage. It is said that the government's intention is that submitting the proposal to the Senate is sufficient, and whether it can be discussed during this short session is not a major concern.</p>

<h3>French Chamber of Deputies: Cabinet Narrowly Avoids Defeat</h3>
<p>Resignations of Two Undersecretaries Lead to No-Confidence Vote</p>
<p>The 28th, Reuters, Paris - The French government narrowly avoided defeat in the Chamber of Deputies tonight, as the resignation of two undersecretaries yesterday raised concerns in the Chamber that the government was involved in financial fraud. Prime Minister Tardieu used sincere words to dispel these suspicions, but the atmosphere in the Chamber remained unchanged. A no-confidence motion was put to a vote, with 293 votes in favor of the government and 279 against, a difference of only fourteen votes.</p>
<p>The 28th, Reuters, Paris - Undersecretary of Public Works Folquet and Undersecretary of Fine Arts Lautier have both resigned to allow the investigative committee to freely act and state everything during the investigation of the Oustric Bank collapse. Both undersecretaries stated today that they are customers of the bank and have legitimate dealings with it. The Oustric Bank has a capital of one million francs and is closely related to the Adam Bank. The day after the Adam Bank collapsed on November 6, the Oustric Bank suspended payments.</p>
<h3>Stalin's Interview with Japanese Reporter</h3>
<p>Denies Being a Dictator</p>
<p>Claims Capitalism and Communism Can Coexist</p>
<p>Moscow News - Reports from Riga claiming that Soviet leader Stalin has been assassinated are completely false. Stalin met with a Japanese reporter on the 23rd for over an hour, with Minister of the Army and Navy Voroshilov also present. Both Stalin and Voroshilov denied the rumors of a counter-revolutionary rebellion and the arrest of General Belu-Chem (Galen). Voroshilov smiled and said, "Is there a need to deny such nonsense?" Stalin laughed loudly and denied being a dictator, stating that anyone who uses this title is either completely ignorant of the organization of the Soviet government and the Communist Party or is intentionally fabricating rumors. The Japanese reporter asked, "Can the capitalist system and the communist system coexist?" Stalin replied, "It is possible. The best evidence is that they have peacefully coexisted since the end of the Russian Revolution and foreign intervention." Stalin expressed no hope for the Geneva Disarmament Preparatory Conference but said that the Soviet Union could not avoid any efforts toward peace, no matter how weak. Regarding the issue of dumping, Stalin said that although the Soviet Union might be able to produce cheaper goods as a result of eliminating speculators and middlemen, it was laughable to say that it could export goods at a loss. The true meaning of dumping is exporting at a loss. (World)</p>
<h3>Sabotage of Russian Industry Case</h3>
<p>Trial of Eight Defendants Completed</p>
<p>The 28th, National News Agency, Moscow - During the trial of the eight technical experts, Fedotov confessed that, in addition to receiving money from abroad through the Industrial and Commercial Committee, foreign capitalists also provided significant financial support. Because the Five-Year Industrial Plan progressed rapidly, the command center shifted from the committee to the French General Staff. Uzhukin provided detailed information about the group's attempts to obstruct Russian transportation by reducing fuel supplies and using various destructive methods, as well as his secret contacts with French organizations stationed in Moscow. After each of the eight defendants was questioned, the prosecutor stated that although the defendants claimed to have confessed everything, based on the information obtained during the investigation and trial, many key points had not been fully clarified. Therefore, he requested that nine witnesses, who were closely associated with the eight defendants, be summoned. The judge approved the request. The truth about the French organizations (K) and (R) mentioned will be secretly investigated.</p>

<h3>Japan's Ministry of Home Affairs Plans to Issue Unemployment Bonds</h3>
<p>Opinions Not Yet Aligned with the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>The 29th, Electric News, Tokyo - Mr. Yoshida, Director of the Social Bureau of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and Mr. Sannobe, Director of the Civil Engineering Bureau, visited Mr. Fujii, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, yesterday morning regarding the unemployment bond plan, presenting the Ministry of Home Affairs' proposal for road improvement projects and subsidies for local unemployment relief projects, totaling 30 million yen. The Ministry of Finance argued that it could not afford the interest and proposed 20 million yen. The two sides failed to reach an agreement and decided to negotiate further.</p>
<p>The 29th, Japan United Press, Tokyo - A meeting of the Ministry of Finance was held this morning, resolving that the maximum limit for unemployment bonds would be 20 million yen, with no further increases. Director of the Budget Bureau Fujii will soon request that representatives from the Ministry of Home Affairs attend to request a reduction of 7.8 million yen from the original proposal.</p>
<h3>British Coal Mining Working Hours Issue</h3>
<p>The 28th, Reuters, London - The Coal Mines Act, established by Parliament, stipulates that from December 1st, miners will work seven and a half hours per day instead of eight hours. Mine owners believe that implementing the seven-and-a-half-hour system is uneconomical and will inevitably lead to wage reduction issues. Therefore, they proposed changing to 45 hours per week or 90 hours per half-month. Today, the Miners' Federation held a miners' representative conference to discuss five hours, deciding to reject the mine owners' proposal to calculate working hours on a weekly basis. From this point, a serious situation will arise in the British mining industry. If there is no temporary solution, there will be a partial shutdown on December 1st. The Miners' Federation advocates that if there is a shutdown in one area, there should be a nationwide shutdown. The Coal Industry Division of the Ministry of Electricity stated that Minister of Electricity Graham and Parliamentary Secretary Wingfield, upon hearing the resolution of the Miners' Conference, had summoned representatives from both sides and telegraphed the mine owners and miners in each coal region, intending to avert the industrial dispute. The government telegraphed the mine owners to negotiate temporary solutions with the miners and continue working while awaiting next week's Miners' Federation meeting. The government also urged the miners not to strike temporarily. The Miners' Federation has now telegraphed each region, urging them to immediately negotiate a daily working hour arrangement of seven and a half hours before the general meeting on December 4th.</p>

<h3>Zhang Jingjiang Resigns as Zhejiang Chairman</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhenjun and Liu Shixin Submit Resignations Together</p>
<p>It is heard that Mr. Zhang Jingjiang, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has firmly decided to relinquish his local responsibilities and focus on assisting the central government. Speculation about his successor has been rife and inconclusive in recent days. As his departure nears, Mr. Zhang hosted a farewell banquet at 6 PM on the 28th in the assembly hall of the Provincial Government, with his wife, Ms. Zhu, for over 130 attendees including members of the Provincial Government, directors of various departments, secretaries, section chiefs, and others such as Cheng Zhenjun and Liu Shixin. The event was lively with toasts and farewells. Mr. Zhang's resignation telegram was sent on the 26th. Concurrently, Cheng Zhenjun, Director of the Civil Affairs Department, and Liu Shixin, Secretary-General, also telegraphed their resignations to the central government. The telegrams are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Zhang Jingjiang's Resignation Telegram: Urgent, to Nanjing, for the consideration of the Chairman of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan. Since winter of the 17th year, I, Renjie, was ordered to preside over the administration of Zhejiang. I originally dared not accept such an important regional responsibility with my declining health. However, considering that the primary task of nation-building lies in the people's livelihood and the goal of the revolution lies in construction, and with a hundred tasks awaiting to be undertaken after the reform, Zhejiang Province possesses a favorable environment and relatively abundant resources. It is appropriate to strive for construction, set an example, and gradually realize the late Premier's grand plan for nation-building. Therefore, I have forgotten my limitations and diligently worked since taking office. For the past two years, I have been striving day and night, fearing that I would fail the central government's entrustment and disappoint the expectations of the twenty million compatriots in Zhejiang. Fortunately, my colleagues in the Provincial Government have united in one heart, and the elders of the province have gladly assisted, with the central government showing exceptional consideration. Therefore, in addition to streamlining administrative affairs, there has been a preliminary plan for the material construction of this province, laying the initial foundation for creation. However, I am constantly apprehensive about initiating new projects, beset by numerous doubts and difficulties, and fearing that my plans may be inadequate. Moreover, I am constantly struggling to cope with the pressures from all sides, resulting in limited achievements and mental exhaustion. Since the beginning of summer this year, I have been afflicted with ailments, with hardly a peaceful day. My appetite and sleep have gradually decreased, and my mental acuity has deteriorated. I am aware that my declining health is no longer suitable for handling such demanding responsibilities. Considering that the remnants of the rebellion were still active in Henan and Longxi, and that petty thieves were eyeing the borders of Zhejiang, the safety of the local areas was linked to the fate of the Party and the nation. Renjie, having dedicated himself to the revolution, dared not prioritize his own well-being. Therefore, I have been enduring and refraining from complaining. Now, fortunately, the country is pacified, and unity is firmly re-established. The central government has taken the lead and is revitalizing the new order. Renjie, considering his weakness, should only serve the central government and focus on planning to assist in the important task of construction. I am unfit to concurrently bear the heavy responsibility of local administration, which would lead to numerous delays in both public and private affairs. Therefore, I sincerely request permission to resign from the position of member and chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and that a virtuous and capable person be promptly appointed to take over, in order to prioritize provincial administration and assign responsibility to the right person. As for the major initiatives planned during my tenure, such as transportation, water conservancy, electricity, agriculture, and mining, whether the facilities are just starting to be implemented or are awaiting completion, although the deliberations may be crude, they are all related to the well-being of the people and are the foundation for all construction. The central government, mindful of the people's hardships, will surely provide consistent support in promoting economic and cultural construction throughout the country, so that Renjie can avoid the criticism of starting without finishing, and the people of Zhejiang can benefit from a lasting solution. Although Renjie is leaving office, my heart is set on seeing these initiatives come to fruition. My earnest and foolish desire is difficult to restrain. I hereby appeal for your consideration. I await your orders with utmost anxiety. Zhang Renjie, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, respectfully submits. Stamped.</p>
<p>Cheng Zhenjun's Resignation Telegram: To Nanjing, for the consideration of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan. Since receiving the appointment, Zhenjun, has served for over three years. Not only have I failed to achieve much, but I also feel mentally and physically exhausted. Recently, with my concurrent position in civil affairs, I feel even more overwhelmed and unable to cope. I ought to sincerely present my situation and request permission to resign from all my concurrent positions, so that I can retire to recuperate and plan for future contributions. I await your orders with utmost anxiety. Cheng Zhenjun, Member of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Director of the Construction Department, and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, respectfully submits. Stamped.</p>
<p>Liu Shixin's Resignation Telegram: To Nanjing, for the consideration of the National Government and the President of the Executive Yuan. I, Shixin, with my limited talent, was erroneously entrusted with the appointment. For half a year, I have been constantly concerned about failing to meet expectations, and have merely striven to follow Chairman Zhang. Now that he has resigned, I have lost my guidance and should resign from my position accordingly to avoid further shortcomings. I earnestly request your approval. I await your orders with utmost anxiety. Liu Shixin, Secretary-General of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Stamped.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Guangxi Amidst Talk of Peace and War</h3>
<p>Bombing of Nanning by Aircraft and Troop Movements on Both Sides</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The situation in Guangxi remains largely unchanged. Since Miao Peinan pacified Zhang's army and Ma Xiaojun reorganized Gui's army, proceeding separately, reports have emerged daily that Zhang and Gui armies are demanding extravagant terms. Zhang Fakui, citing that most of his troops are reorganized Gui forces, fears that the transfer of military power may not be easily implemented. The alleged demands of Gui's army include: (1) Li Zongren, Zhang Fakui, and Bai Chongxi must resign and each receive 100,000 yuan from the central government for overseas travel expenses; (2) Zhang and Gui armies will be reorganized by Huang Shaoxiong and stationed in their original locations; (3) Huang Shaoxiong will be given the title of Chairman of the Guangxi Provincial Government to be responsible for reorganizing the Guangxi situation. The above are said to be the demands of Zhang and Gui sides, but this information has not been formally telegraphed by the peace representatives Miao and Ma. Therefore, whether the peace talks can be realized remains unknown. However, amidst this silence of peace talks, military actions have become tense again. Recently, large portions of Zhang and Gui armies have been appearing in Liuzhou, Nanning, Wuming, and Guixian. On the 21st of this month, Liang Hansong's unit of Gui's army, consisting of approximately 2,000 men, suddenly moved towards Yantang, with a small number remaining to guard Dachun Market in Guixian. On the 22nd, the Guard Regiment of the Eighth Route Army, led by Chen Hanguang, launched an attack on the enemy with the Second Battalion and two companies of the Supplementary Battalion, successfully recapturing Dachun Market and seizing hundreds of enemy weapons and a large amount of supplies and horses. According to a telegram from Commander Chen, "Yesterday, it was confirmed that the rebel Liang Hansong led most of the training corps to Yantang, with their rear undefended at Dachun Market. I seized the opportunity to send the Second Battalion and a unit of the Supplementary Battalion to attack Dachun at dawn. The rebels were unable to resist and fled in disarray, capturing countless supplies and horses. Currently searching for remaining enemies. Chen Hanguang respectfully reports." According to the above telegram, the reason for the movement of Zhang and Gui armies is to defend against the bombing by the Eighth Route Army's air squadron. In recent days, aircraft have been dropping leaflets inside Nanning, stating that Yan and Feng have stepped down and the country is at peace. However, Li, Bai, Zhang, and Huang rely on the dangers of Nanning and Liuzhou as obstacles to unification. In order to promote national unity, the army has decided to deploy dozens of aircraft returning from the Northern Expedition and those remaining in Guangdong to bomb the two cities. All beloved civilians residing in the cities are requested to relocate entirely within three days to avoid being destroyed together. A special announcement is made to comply with this order. Chen Jitang, Commander-in-Chief of the Eighth Route Army, November 21st." At the same time, the Education Brigade of the 59th Division of the Eighth Route Army, led by Yu Hanmou, and the unit led by Huang Renhuan also departed from Binchen on the 21st and headed towards Sitang and Santang. The 63rd Division, led by Li Yangjing, the 16th Division led by Yang Dingzhong, and the Guard Regiment led by Chen Hanguang advanced towards Yongchun in Guixian. To support the air force with military supplies, 500 boxes of aviation fuel and 500 bombs were transported from Guangzhou on the 24th aboard two civilian ships to Wuzhou for the air force's use. It is reported that the enemy army, hearing of the Eighth Route Army's preparations for a large-scale offensive, has been moving towards the left and right rivers. Zhang Fakui's troops have already set out, with Li Mingrui as the vanguard, advancing towards Baise. It is rumored that Zhang's army fears that it will be unable to gain a foothold in Guangxi and intends to lead its troops into Yunnan to seek provisions. Another account claims that Zhang's army is moving to the Pingma area to first deal with Lu Han's Yunnan army entering Guangxi, opening the Longzhou route to facilitate supply. (November 25th)</p>
<h3>Fujian Merchants Request Troops to Protect Cargo Transport</h3>
<p>Establishment of Escort Offices Along the Min River</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Cargo transport between northern Fujian and Fuzhou could have resumed immediately after the end of the punitive Lu military campaign. However, due to rampant banditry along the upper reaches of the Min River, cargo and merchants have frequently been robbed, preventing transport from flowing smoothly until now. With the end of the year approaching, a crucial time for commercial transport, delays cannot be tolerated. The Fuzhou and Yanping Chambers of Commerce have convened local merchant groups to discuss and resolve to organize an armed escort office. They have requested the troops stationed along the route to send soldiers to protect the ships to avoid dangerous journeys. The required expenses will be borne by the merchants. They have liaised with the military authorities and the escort office is scheduled to open on November 26th. The main office will be located in Fuzhou, with branch offices in Hongshan, Shuikou, and Yanping. The troops stationed along the route will be designated to be at Jixi, Xiexia, Dapai Village, Yuexi, Tantou, Jiaokeng, Youxikou, Zhanghuban (the above are Lu's defense areas), Chenggoutan, Gukou, Jinchang, Chichi, Anrenxi, Minqingkou, Yuankou, Xiaqi, Jinzhongge, Baishitou, and Huaianjiao (the above are Liu's defense areas), totaling 21 locations, so that merchant ships can request troops for escort at any time. With the protection issue resolved, merchant groups are preparing to start transporting goods. On the financial front, since the suspension of cargo transport during the Sixth and Seventh Wars, merchant groups have not needed to borrow from money houses to purchase goods, resulting in surplus funds for the money houses. Savings accounts, except for fixed-term deposits, are being returned to avoid unnecessary interest costs. Promissory notes with good credit are being issued at low interest rates, only taking 8 or 9 percent. Fuzhou, one of the poorest areas, is almost becoming prosperous overnight. Recently, with the resumption of river transport, merchants are preparing to purchase goods and need to borrow from money houses again, so the financial sector is also becoming active along with the merchants.

<h3>Rumors of Establishment of Pacification Commissioner in Fujian Province</h3>
<p>Reports that Zhu Shaoliang Will Serve as Pacification Commissioner</p>
<p>Lu's Army Requests Departure Fees and Defense Assignments for Jianning and Shaowu</p>
<p>Zhou's Unit Requests Reorganization into National Army Independent Brigade</p>
<p>Chen Jiliang Telegrams Lin Shouguo to Discuss Military Affairs</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: It is heard that after Mao Bingwen's division arrives in western Fujian, Zhu Shaoliang, Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression, will come to the province by sea with Mao and Li Zhengzhong. The National Government plans to establish a Pacification Commissioner's Office in Fuzhou as the highest military authority in the province, with Zhu concurrently serving as the Commissioner, to achieve greater results with less effort. The Fujian Provincial Committee has also telegraphed Zhu to come.</p>
<p>Chairman Jiang instructed Yang Shuzhuang to order Lu's troops to withdraw from Youxi and Yanping before December 1st and go to western Fujian to participate in bandit suppression. Yang has telegraphed the Provincial Government to order Lu to comply. After receiving the previous telegram, Lu Xingbang, in addition to telegraphing Lin Shaoqi, his representative stationed in the province, to return to Yanping to discuss defense arrangements, telegraphed the Provincial Government yesterday, stating that his troops are concentrating and preparing to depart, but the required departure fees are substantial. He requested the Finance Department to allocate funds to avoid delaying the deadline. The Provincial Government is currently reviewing the matter. It is also heard that Lu Xingbang, believing that the garrison troops in Shaowu, Guangze, Jiantai, Ninghua, Qingliu, and Guihua counties are weak, plans to send troops to garrison there. As the Provincial Government's troops have not yet been relieved of their war preparations, it is feared that misunderstandings may occur. He has telegraphed Lin Shaoqi, Director of the Provincial Office in Fujian, to request the Provincial Government to promptly order its troops to relieve Lu's forces of their war preparations to facilitate the dispatch of troops to block key points in the counties. It is unknown how the Provincial Government will decide. After Lu Xingming's death, Lu Xingbang telegraphed to request to concurrently serve as the commander of the First Brigade. The Provincial Government, considering that the unit is being transferred and temporarily cannot be without command, has approved his request.</p>
<p>Zhou Ziqun expressed his willingness to surrender and was appointed by the Provincial Government as the commander of the Second Brigade of the Western Fujian Bandit Suppression Front, but the reorganization has not yet been implemented. Recently, Zhou telegraphed the Provincial Government, requesting that it consider reorganizing his unit into an independent brigade of the National Army. The telegram stated that the bandits in central Fujian are rampant and that his unit, since being incorporated, has been tasked with bandit suppression. During last year's campaign in western Fujian, he deeply felt that it was difficult to coordinate because the division headquarters were in Shangyou. Now, being directly under the Provincial Government, the affairs below the division level, especially for the infantry brigade, are particularly cumbersome during both peacetime and wartime. He requested permission to refer to the organization of the National Army's independent brigade and propose a new format to facilitate early reorganization. It is yet to be determined whether the Provincial Government will approve his request.</p>
<p>Lin Shouguo, commander of the Second Division of the Army, recently submitted his resignation, requesting that one of Lin Xudong or Lin Bingzhou be chosen as his successor. Chairman Yang comforted and retained him, but Lin insisted on resigning. His resignation has been approved for temporary recuperation. The position of brigade commander will be temporarily taken over by the commander of the First Regiment of the brigade. However, after Lu's troops withdrew from Youxi and Yanping, there are questions about whether to send the brigade to garrison and resettle the area, awaiting further discussion. Lin Bingzhou is still declining the position. Therefore, Chen Jiliang telegraphed Lin Shouguo yesterday (the 24th) to invite him to the province to discuss the matter at length (November 26th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Resident in Jinan Shoots Policeman</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Recently, the authorities have been strictly investigating drugs such as white pills and heroin. Chinese people no longer dare to buy or sell them. Japanese merchants who make a living from this are panicking. They are using cars to transport drugs to various places to avoid inspection. At 8:20 PM on the 26th, two Japanese men carrying a large amount of drugs were spotted by a police officer on Weijiu Road, Second Great Road, in the commercial port area. The police officer questioned them. The two Japanese men gave ambiguous answers. As the police officer was about to step forward to inspect them, the Japanese man suddenly drew a pistol and fired a shot at the police officer's chest. The police officer fell to the ground, and the two men took the opportunity to escape. When officers from neighboring posts arrived after hearing the gunshot, they were already gone. The officer, named Ren Zhongyuan, a third-class police officer, was rushed to Jinan Hospital for treatment. He was shot in the chest and his life may be in danger. Chen Weixin, the mayor of Jinan, is paying close attention to this matter. On one hand, he has ordered the strict arrest of the perpetrator. On the other hand, it is heard that he will severely crack down on Japanese drug trafficking. (November 27th)</p>
<h3>Relaxation of Grain Transport Ban to Russia in Suifenhe</h3>
<p>Prohibition Remains in Place for Manchuria-Russia border area. Jilin Dispatch: During the anti-Russian campaign last fall, the northeastern provinces banned the export of miscellaneous grains to prevent private transportation of supplies to the enemy. During this time, the local grain trade was stagnant, and supply exceeded demand. The grain had a slow sales, and the economy suffered. Moreover, this year's autumn harvest in the eastern provinces is particularly abundant. If no measures are taken to alleviate the situation, the harm will be even greater. Previously, the Jilin Provincial Government submitted a request to relax the ban, and the Northeast Political Affairs Committee distributed orders to comply. After receiving the order, the Supervisor of the Binjiang Customs, regarding whether the export of grain to Russia from the Suifenhe customs, which is connected to the Russian border, should also be relaxed, inquired to the Political Affairs Committee about opening international trade. The Committee instructed the Heilongjiang Provincial Government and the Special Administrative Region Governor to review the matter. Subsequently, the Jiangxi Province replied that, since diplomatic relations between China and Russia have not been fully restored, the two locations of Manzhouli and Heihe should continue to prohibit the export of grain. The Committee approved the reply and instructed that the old ban should be maintained. As for the export of grain from Suifenhe to Vladivostok, the Special Administrative Region Governor replied that he planned to follow the pre-anti-Russian campaign method of requiring merchants to provide evidence proving that the grain will not be unloaded in Vladivostok, in order to prevent it from being transferred to supply the enemy. The Committee believed that the situation now is different from the past, and that the previous method may not be applicable, so it ordered a further review. According to a telegram from Xiao Dai, "Regarding the case of relaxing the grain ban, the office originally intended to restore the pre-anti-Russian campaign method to show restrictions. Upon reviewing the previous method, for those exporting to Europe and Japan via Vladivostok, it is necessary to obtain proof that the goods will not be unloaded in Vladivostok for transfer to Soviet Russia. However, the Chinese consul in Vladivostok does not have the authority to inspect, and Chinese and foreign merchants will resort to all kinds of fraud for profit, making it impossible to prevent. While this type of restriction is not without benefit, it is difficult to consider it completely thorough. If we fear that this may provide the Russian side with an excuse, it may be better to completely relax the ban. Fortunately, this relaxation is voluntary. If the situation changes in the future and a ban must be reinstated, the authority remains in our hands, so there should be no problem." The Political Affairs Committee considered the submission feasible and instructed that the request be approved and distributed to the Jilin and Jiangxi provinces for their respective jurisdictions to comply.

<h3>Brief News from Wuhu</h3>
<p>The Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau and the County Government jointly convened a meeting with the General Chamber of Commerce and other organizations. Regarding the Provincial Government's quota of 60,000 yuan for the subscription of customs tax treasury bonds, it was decided that slightly over 30,000 yuan would be subscribed, and a request would be made for a reduction. The subscribed 30,000 yuan will be collected from the tenants through a deduction from rents, with landlords and tenants each bearing half, starting from the first of next month. However, citizens are deeply concerned about the heavy burden of being assigned treasury bonds so soon after the end of the firearm donation collection through rent deductions.</p>
<p>After the revision of the tax rates for exported rice and grain in Anhui, the Wuhu General Chamber of Commerce and various merchant groups, citing that various local surcharges have not been canceled and that the procedures for collecting both silver taels and silver dollars are cumbersome, sent Chairman Wu Xingzhou of the General Chamber of Commerce and committee member She Ceqin, along with more than ten others, to the Provincial Government to petition. The Director of the Finance Department, Yuan Jiashan, received them and agreed to submit the matter to the Provincial Government for discussion. The representatives have returned to Wuhu yesterday.</p>
<p>Bao Geng, the outgoing Special Finance Commissioner, was ordered by the Provincial Government to be arrested and detained by the Wuhu Municipal Public Security Bureau, but he has not been released to this day.

The investigation has been completed, and he took the riverboat to return to Beijing today to report.</p>

As the trial period is about to expire, the new director, Shen, requested at the 85th county council meeting that the previous plan be continued for several months.

<p>Appeal from the Oppressed Construction Industry: The Zhenjiang Construction Industry Association, feeling oppressed by the various harsh demands of the Engineering Office, such as forcing the drawing of plans, prohibiting the use of random bricks in wall construction, stopping the repair of houses within the demolition route, and delaying the issuance of construction permits, could no longer tolerate it. They convened a meeting of all members to discuss solutions, resolving to: (1) submit another petition to the Construction Department requesting assistance; (2) send a letter to the Chamber of Commerce requesting assistance; and (3) petition the County Party Headquarters to forward a petition to the Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting the Provincial Government to order the Construction Department to severely punish the responsible personnel. Those present at the meeting were very indignant and determined not to stop until their goals were achieved.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Continued Search for Deputy Guerrilla Brigade Commander: A group of armed police officers from the county police team arrived at Xiannyu Temple in the county the day before yesterday to search for Zhang Zhang, the deputy brigade commander of the Fifth Brigade of the Xu-Huai-Hai Guerrilla Force, at the Zhangtai Hotel in the town. They did not find him. It was heard that Zhang and his subordinate officers had been recruiting in the town before Brigade Commander Yan was arrested, with over twenty officers and men. When the police arrived, they had all fled upon hearing the news. It was also learned that the town's Public Security Bureau and Merchant Corps checked two male and female travelers at the Sanyuan Hotel last night (the 27th). The woman claimed to be a family member of the commander of the First Brigade of the Xu-Huai-Hai Guerrilla Force, and the man was a bodyguard, carrying a passport from the brigade. After some persuasion, they were ordered to leave the area this morning. The Details of Chen, the Warden's Long-Distance Escape: Chen Quan, the former warden of the Jiangdu County detention center, was reported by the County Court to the High Court for allowing a prisoner to escape. After President Lin of the court ordered the county to supervise Chen and transfer him to the Zhenjiang Court for investigation, the County Court obeyed the order and supervised Chen. Chen became ill during his detention, and a certain pharmacy guaranteed his release for medical treatment. A few days ago, the Zhenjiang District Court Prosecutor's Office sent a letter to the County Court here, requesting Chen be escorted to Zhenjiang for investigation. Unexpectedly, Chen Quan, the former warden, escaped halfway during the escort. It is now heard that the court here is ordering the guarantor to pursue him and submitting a request to the High Court to issue a warrant for his arrest.</p>
<p>Robbery and Injury Case Outside the South Gate: At about 1:00 AM on the 28th, four robbers broke into the back door of Ding Chunchang's grocery store outside the South Gate, at the south end of the Big Alley, and searched and looted the premises. They used knives to resist and injured the owner, who sustained three wounds. The case was immediately reported to the Fourth Public Security Precinct for investigation.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Murder Case in the Western Countryside: Wang Jiafu, a resident of Dongwang Village in the western Xiaoshan countryside, was stabbed in the throat with a sharp knife by Wang Shangfa, a member of the same clan, on the night of the 25th, and died instantly. Neighbors noticed the incident, but the assailant, Wang Shangfa, had already disappeared. His brother, Wang Axing, came to rescue him upon hearing the alarm, but Jiafu was covered in blood, his throat was cut, and he could not be saved and died soon after. The corpse's brother has submitted a report to the County Court requesting an inquest and asking for the arrest and punishment of the murderer. The reason for the feud between Shangfa and Jiafu is unknown.</p>
<p>Survey of Grain Harvest in the County This Year: The early and late rice harvests in the four rural areas of Xiaoshan have been completely harvested. According to the Agricultural Association's survey, the total yield is 340,000 dan. In addition, there are approximately 52,000 dan of glutinous rice and Guangxian rice. The yield is five times higher than last year. The highest yield is from high fields, yielding two dan per mu. Low fields yield 1.5 dan per mu. The average yield per mu is 1.8 dan. Farmers say that this year's harvest is considered an excellent bumper crop.</p>
<p>Further Inquiry into the Kidnapping and Robbery Case in Houfang Village: Fang Jiaxian's house in Houfang Village was broken into by over ten bandits armed with weapons on the night of the 23rd, who robbed him of 400 yuan in cash and clothing worth about 600 yuan. They also kidnapped Fang and demanded a ransom of 50,000 yuan. The Fang family reported the case to the Public Security Bureau, which forwarded it for investigation. It is heard that the bandits came across the Yangtze River from the Jianghai Ning ferry and often disguise themselves as cloth peddlers and oil-fried rice vendors in the Xiaosibu and Zheshan areas, scouting out households in advance and then robbing them at night.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Liu Fu Village Kidnapping Case: Pan Dingguo, a farmer in Niduntan Yuan, Liu Fu Village, Yuyao, who is relatively well-off, was attacked by more than twenty bandits at about 2:00 AM the day before yesterday. Two bandits stood guard outside the door with wooden-cased guns and flashlights. The other bandits ransacked the house, stealing more than 130 yuan in cash, jewelry, and many clothes. They kidnapped his son, Kaiyong. After the bandits left, Pan rang the gong and gathered more than two hundred people to track them down, but they were not found.</p>
<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Three More Arrested in Farmers' Riot Case: Over two hundred farmers in Xiejiatang, harboring resentment against Xie Bingchu, a wealthy household in the area, for taking advantage of his position to collect excessive rent without following public assessment regulations, and incited by others, suddenly rioted on the afternoon of the 8th of this month. They surrounded Xie's residence and confiscated two firearms from his security corps' sentry post. Fortunately, members of the corps armed and dispersed the farmers, preventing a major disaster. Xie reported the incident to the County Government, which, on the following day, together with Xia Chunhua, the platoon leader of the Eleventh Company of the Security Corps stationed in the city, led a team to the countryside and arrested Yu Jinfu, who was sent to the city for interrogation and detention. The confiscated firearms were also recovered. The county reported the incident to the province and purchased a wire to track down the principal offenders. It was extended until yesterday, when three people involved in the case, Ni Youfu, Ni Qichang, and Zhang Ayiao, were arrested in the Huilong Temple area of the western countryside of Yuyao and transferred to the county. It is learned that the county government has received an order from the province to arrest and escort the prisoners to the province for trial.</p>

<h3>Wang Yunwu to Head China Public School College of Social Sciences</h3>
<p>Ma Junwu, the principal of China Public School, is still working hard to carry out school affairs. Because Gao Yihan, the president of the College of Social Sciences, has firmly resigned and it is difficult to get him to return to the school, it is heard that Principal Ma plans to invite Wang Yunwu to take over. The students also strongly support this. Wang is one of the school's directors, and he made no small contribution to the settlement of this student unrest.</p>
<h3>Record of the Shanghai Art College Achievement Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts held its 36th semester achievement exhibition from the 28th to the 30th for three days. Several Boy Scouts stood guard at the gate of the school. In the exhibition hall, the works of the professors are the most eye-catching. The most prominent is the lion of President Liu Haisu, the founder of the school. This painting was made by Liu in Belgium. The brushwork is bold, and the intention is profound. Wang Yuanbo's "God of Spring" is drawn on thin wood, which not only feels profound but also has an oriental style, opening up a path for Western painting. Other works by Jiang Zhaohe, Pan Tianshou, Zhu Wenyun, Pan Sijian, Liu Hairuo, Huang Xiaochi, Jiang Danshu, Xie Gongzhan, etc., are also hung on the walls. The achievements of the students are numerous, filling more than 20 classrooms. Western paintings, Chinese paintings, and patterns are all available.

<h3>Jiangda Football Match</h3>
<p>Jinan Won 1-0 Over Guanghua, Jiaotong and Fudan Tie 1-1 (1)</p>
<p>Jinan and Guanghua</p>
<p>The Jinan University football team played against Guanghua University yesterday afternoon at 3 o'clock in the Jiangda Championship game. The cheerleaders from both sides cheered wildly. Thirty minutes after the start of the game, Tong Rongwen of Jinan scored a goal from Dai Linjing's ball. The first half ended with Jinan winning by one point. There were no wins or losses in the second half, but the ball was often on Guanghua's side. However, Jinan's skills were actually much better than Guanghua's. Unfortunately, Jinan's forwards were not accurate and were accustomed to fighting on the grass, but today's Guanghua stadium is hard and uneven, causing the heroes to have no use for their martial arts.</p>
<h3>Ball Game Anecdotes</h3>
<p>(China and Foreign News Agency) In previous years, when Guanghua came to Jinan to compete, although the two armies were fighting each other, they were modest and added. Before the Jinan campus, it was necessary to write the words (Welcome Guanghua University players) to promote friendship. Yesterday, Jinan attacked Guanghua. Guanghua was the host and waited with ease. The cheering group was well-trained and colorful, which was too impolite. Unexpectedly, a couplet was written in front of the hall (It doesn't take much effort to defeat the Southern Barbarians) (Overcoming Zhenru relies entirely on footwork). The Jinan team was filled with anger, but they swallowed their anger and adhered to the principle that politics is not about talking too much. After the battle, a member of Jinan's scoring team shouted (It takes all your breastfeeding to not defeat the southern strong) (Overcoming Zhenru is not just bragging). It can be said that it is very teasing. After the game, Jinan won 1-0, so the cheerleaders and the school workers' association blew and beat the gongs and drums, flaunting their power, and walked out of the Guanghua campus. They saw a couplet hanging in the stadium opposite Guanghua (The team is like a raging fire, burning into a black charcoal ball. The two armies in the ash stove are soulless and pull Huang Bao to return to Zhenru). Gai Guanghua ridiculed the arrogance of Jinan's defeat and return. So another prankster changed the couplet and shouted (The team is like a raging fire, unable to defeat the great benefit of Jinan. The younger generations are so sad and fail to the west) (referring to the defeat on Daxi Road) (The army has a god and a spirit, pulls Guanghua's car, and sends the masters back to Zhenru with pleasure). I saw a thousand gold lady from Guanghua running from behind to comfort her friend and saying that it was good to only lose one, there was nothing embarrassing.</p>
<h3>(2) Jiaotong and Fudan Battle</h3>
<p>Jiaotong University and Fudan University played the Jiangda football match at the Jiaotong University stadium at 2:30 yesterday afternoon, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Referee: He Chunhui.</p>
<p>Evenly Divided, Fudan Kicks off the Day Attacking to the Left but is Unsuccessful. Jiaotong Counters but also Does Not Succeed. This Went Back and Forth More Than Ten Times, but all Halted Halfway. In general, Jiaotong's Forwards are Lively and Good at Attacking, but Suffered from a Lack of Accurate Shooting, Simply Wasting Opportunities. Fudan's Strikes Were Powerful, but Unable to Obtain the Cooperation of the Center Line, Resulting in Isolated Troops Being Trapped. In Terms of Inner Guards, Jiaotong's Wang Gongchen Has a Firm Kick and a Suitable Position, with the Air of a Great General with Power in All Directions. A Mournful Bell Rang Three Times. Jiaotong's Yang Xinghua Passed to Wan Mian in Front of the Goal on the Left Inner Forward, Facing an Empty Goal He Shot Wildly, Losing the Opportunity in Arm's Reach. Fortunately, After Four Minutes, Jiaotong Attacked Again, the Forwards Gained Momentum and Crowded in, and Center Forward Liu Ximeng Scored the First Goal. Six Minutes Later, Fudan Shook their Arms and Counterattacked on a Large Scale, Forcing a Corner Kick, Which Was Then Passed by Left Winger Zhang Weixin to the Left Wing Li Bin. Li Picked a Suitable Delivery, and the Ball Fell in Front of the Card. At That Time, Jiaotong's Inner Guard Was Focused on Closely Monitoring the Enemy, Unexpectedly the Ball Fell on the Back of the Inner Guard and Landed Next to Him. Fudan's Yao Yongbing Took Advantage of the Situation and Completed the Great Feat. Both Sides Scored a Goal Each, and the First Half Soon Came to a Close.</p>
<p>Deadlocked, in the Beginning of the Second Half the Two Armies Had Scattered Strategies and Were in a Tired State. Almost Ten Minutes Later, Fudan's Forwards Had a Cooperative Effort and Attacked Several Times, Containing Dangerous Elements. Ten Minutes Later, Jiaotong Gained Momentum, Two Inner Guards Were Stationed on the Middle Area Line to Provide Remote Support. Before Long, Li Beiliang Replaced Shen Guanlan in Battle, Doing His Best. In the Last Fifteen Minutes, Fudan and Jiaotong Encountered Danger Successively. At First, Jiaotong's Forwards Wandered in Front of Fudan's Goal for a Long Time, Eventually Going Astray. Fudan Then Made a Surprising Move Amidst Worries and Pressures, Rushing Forward at a Thousand Miles to Form a Corner Kick. When the Ball Landed in Front of the Goal, the Two Armies Fought to the Death, Suddenly Seeing the Goalkeeper Punch Out of Danger. Soon After the Silver Whistle Sounded, Announcing the End. The Result Was That Each Scored One Goal, Resulting in a Draw.</p>

In the second half, the Pirates tried hard to counterattack, and the situation became more balanced. However, the Pirates never surpassed Qingguang. In the end, Qingguang won by a large margin with a score of 38-21. The referee was Xu Zhendong. Tan Dahua and Chen Hualuo of Qingguang scored a total of 30 points.</p>

<p>Huadong Defeated Yeshi: The last match between Huadong and Yeshi aroused great interest among the spectators. It was expected that Huadong, which was famous for a time, would win. However, the result was that Huadong only won by three points, with a score of 32-29, which was quite unexpected. In the first half, the situation was one-sided, and Huadong led with 20-8. In the second half, Yeshi worked hard and played very well. Huadong lost 12-21, but in the overall result, Huadong still won by three points. Last night, Huadong's lineup had a trial flavor. Liang Guoquan was appointed as the center, and Lu Zhongen was appointed as the forward, with Ling Chuan and Erjiang taking turns as assistants. This arrangement was still in its initial stages and had its merits. The referee was Berris.</p>

<p>The Zhao Shiming Memorial Chinese-Western Charity Basketball Game is scheduled to be held on December 2nd at 8:00 PM at the Chinese Basketball Hall, as previously reported. The players for the Chinese and Western teams participating in the game have also been confirmed, and their strength is truly astonishing. The Chinese mixed team consists of Lu Zhongen, Tan Dahua, Wei Haiqing, Xia Zeren, Kong Guangyi, Wang Jinpeng, Li Chengyuan, He Tong, Li Baojun, and others, all of whom are outstanding talents, either representatives of the Far East or top players in Eastern China. They usually go their separate ways and pursue their own careers. Now, to commemorate their late friend Zhao Shiming, these strong players have cooperated, which is truly a legendary story in the Chinese basketball world. The Western representatives are the Youth Association Pirate Team players who dominate Shanghai today: Shi Guiya, Smith, Hannes, Polas, Oer, Sullivan, and Pilay. All of them are giants in this field, capable of both offense and defense, and good at making changes. There will definitely be a fierce battle when they meet in the future.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive This Morning</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang and his wife, Madame Song Meiling, left Beijing last night on an overnight express train and are expected to arrive in Shanghai at 6:30 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>Information on the Division and Numbering of Districts in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Total of Forty Districts Planned</p>
<p>3,342,280 Households</p>
<p>The work of dividing Shanghai into autonomous districts is being actively carried out by the Shanghai Municipal Government's District Division Committee. Based on the existing household registration, ten households are grouped into a "lin" (neighborhood) in bustling areas, and five households are grouped into a "lin" in rural areas. According to this division, a total of forty districts have been divided. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a meeting was held again at the Municipal Government, where Acting Chairman Huang Daolin reported that mapping and registration are currently underway and are expected to be completed by the end of December this year. Since the current work is all administrative, it was decided to temporarily suspend the regular meeting every Saturday. In case of any matter, the chairman and committee members will convene a meeting. The method of dividing and numbering neighborhoods and "lin" has also been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation. The entire city is currently divided into forty districts, and the numbering method was discussed and decided to start from the central Yinhang District, then proceed to the nearby Wusong and Jiangwan districts in order, and then south to all districts in Puxi, and then to Yangsi in Pudong and north to Gaoqiao. The order of numbering, the original district names, the number of households, and the number of households per "lin" are listed below.</p>

<h3>The Upcoming Establishment of the Domestic Debt Creditors' Group</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Tianjin Banking Association Have Reported</p>
<p>One Hundred Million in Japanese Debt Awaiting Consolidation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association initiated the invitation of representatives from the banking associations of Tianjin and Pingjin to organize a domestic debt creditors' group, and nominated representatives to plan the consolidation of domestic debt with the Ministry of Finance. Both Shanghai and Pingjin have nominated representatives who have reported, waiting for Sun Zhongshan, Ding Wenzha, and Zhu Yusheng from Tianjin to arrive in Shanghai to form the organization. It is learned that Ding Wenzha (manager of Huiye Bank) and Zhu Yusheng (manager of Yanye Bank), both representatives from Tianjin, reported to the Banking Association yesterday afternoon. However, Sun Zhongshan (manager of Dazhong Bank) was delayed due to business. Lin Kanghou, a standing committee member of the Banking Association, specially gathered several representatives from various places at the association at 4:00 PM yesterday for an informal discussion on the organization of the domestic debt creditors. It is heard that a full meeting is expected to be convened next Monday or Tuesday to formally establish the organization. As for the domestic and foreign debts awaiting consolidation, there are no exact statistics based on the investigation. However, it is known that the six-percent consolidation public debt issued in May of the tenth year of the Republic of China was 54,392,318 yuan, of which the principal has been repaid six times, and the current debt is 32,635,339 yuan. And the seven-percent consolidation public debt issued in June of the same year was 13.6 million, of which the principal has been repaid six times, and the current debt is 8.16 million. These two types of debts were originally guaranteed by customs surplus, but due to the rising price of gold, the repayment of foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties by converting foreign exchange has caused China to suffer significant losses. Therefore, the decrease in customs surplus and the insufficient guarantee are also within the scope of consolidation. In addition, there is also the ninety-six public debt of 96 million, of which the current debt in silver dollars is 56,391,300 yuan, and the Japanese gold portion has been repaid three times, and the current debt is 32,479,1100 yuan. Because the guarantee is insufficient, it also needs to be consolidated. In addition, it is only known that the Japanese side has the following foreign debts: telecommunications loan of 20 million Japanese yen, gold mine and forest loan of 30 million Japanese yen, Manchuria and Mongolia four-road loan of 20 million Japanese yen, Ji Hui loan of 10 million Japanese yen, and Ji Shun Gao Xu loan of 20 million Japanese yen, totaling a huge amount of 100 million. Although the above are nominally loans from various parties for the construction of enterprises, they are actually used for political and military expenses and the repayment of principal and interest on foreign debts. This is also included in the consolidation.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Expelled Before the Arrival of the British Delegation in China, Please Do Not Entertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday to the Municipal Government to Petition</p>
<p>Yesterday Telegraphed the Central Government Requesting</p>
<p>Today at Noon to Entertain the Press</p>
<p>The British Economic Delegation has scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning. Comrades from the Capital Nanyang British-Dutch Territories Expelled Overseas Chinese Promoting National Diplomacy Support Association have come to Shanghai specifically because of this matter to appeal to various organs in the city to not entertain them. A reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency interviewed the comrades of the association and was told that the British Economic Delegation's visit to China for investigation is completely a preliminary means of implementing economic aggression. It can be seen from the fact that the most important investigation target is the cotton textile industry. It is sufficient for the various organs in China to restrain themselves from international arrogance and entertain them, which is sufficient for the people of the country to ridicule. Moreover, the British who come to China are all ordinary merchants, and the political and commercial circles of China have unanimously welcomed them. On the contrary, the Chinese who go to England are not only subjected to their rude oppression, but even the diplomatic officials appointed by the National Government have not heard of them being warmly welcomed by them. Recently, Zheng Luosheng, the executive committee member of the Kuomintang General Branch in the British Malaya, was ordered by the National Government to raise funds for the rear wounded soldiers' hospital, but was ordered to be expelled by Governor Jin Wen of Singapore, which is even more indignant. Moreover, it has never been heard that the Chinese diplomatic authorities have intervened. Therefore, at this time, we should take the opportunity of the delegation's visit to China to warn them so that the British will no longer bully the Chinese in the future, and so on.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: Zheng Luosheng and Zeng Ziying, comrades of the association who were expelled, came to Shanghai from the capital yesterday morning and went to the Municipal Government with Liao Peizhi and Luo Ciqi to petition Mayor Zhang. Mayor Zhang received them and the representatives explained the various fallacies of the British's insults to China and asked Mayor Zhang not to entertain them. Mayor Zhang immediately agreed to telegraph the Central Government to request instructions and said that he expressed great sympathy for your requests.</p>
<p>Telegraph to the Central Government: After Zheng and others petitioned the Municipal Government, they were quite satisfied with Mayor Zhang's expression. On the other hand, they also telegraphed various departments of the Central Government, appealing to them not to entertain the delegation when it arrives in the capital. The text of the telegram is as follows: (Central Party Headquarters, National Government, Chairman Chiang, Foreign Minister Wang, Minister Sun, Minister Kong, Mayor Wei, Jian Jin Wen, oppress overseas Chinese, strictly prohibit the promotion of national goods, and damage the national relationship, which is infuriating. The British Economic Delegation goes to Beijing, please do not entertain them, urging the British to realize their awakening and declare that the postal submission is specially telegraphed to cry out and beg for your approval to comfort the overseas Chinese, the Foreign Aid Support Association of the Dutch-British Territories)</p>
<p>Invite the press to dinner: At noon today, the colleagues of the association specially invited the local press to Xinghua Lou to report on the various harsh precedents of the Dutch and British imperialism oppressing the Chinese people in order to unite the media and help the imperialists in the UK and the Netherlands to awaken and save tens of millions of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>The British Delegation Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>Entering Beijing on the 3rd, Going to Beiping on the 20th, the British Far East Economic Delegation will come to China to investigate the general commercial situation and the special cotton industry situation, as well as the schedule of investigations in Beijing and Shanghai, which has been repeatedly reported. It is now known that the delegation will arrive in Shanghai at about 10:00 AM today and will land at the New Customs Wharf and stay at the Huamao Hotel. It is scheduled to enter Beijing on December 3 to meet with government officials and return to Shanghai on the 7th and go to Beiping on the 20th.</p>
<h3>The Representatives of the Anti-Dutch Congress Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Report on the Details of the Petition to Beijing, the Shanghai Anti-Dutch Congress of all circles publicly elected representatives Xu Jigong, Wu Mai, Zheng Luosheng, Fang Zhizhen, Xiao Kai, etc. to go to Beijing on the evening of the 26th to petition and negotiate various issues with the Netherlands, which has been reported. The representatives arrived in Beijing early on the 27th and gathered at the Overseas Chinese Reception Center and immediately drove to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where Foreign Minister Wang Yan met with them, and the Director of the European Department, Xu Mo, was also present. Minister Wang spoke first, saying that he knew from the telegram from the General Assembly last night that you were coming to Beijing, so he had already arranged for Director Xu to come here to hold an emergency official-civilian meeting to implement what I said in the Greater China Record Company's recording. A word now officialdom diplomacy has gone to people's diplomacy. After that, the representatives handed over each telegram passed by the General Assembly to Wang Wang Xu for discussion and the result was decided as follows: (1) The Chinese-Dutch Consular Treaty will be abolished by Foreign Minister Wang orally notifying the Dutch Minister Oudenk in Beijing today, and then Director Xu will draft an official document for delivery. (2) The unequal provisions of Article 109 of the Dutch Regulations (Chinese assimilated to indigenous people) should be continued after the notice of abolition of the Chinese-Dutch Consular Treaty is submitted. (3) The resolution to increase the entry tax in the Dutch territories to 150 shields per person and to levy a continued residence wharf tax of 75 shields per person for Chinese workers should be continued by the Ministry of Electronics to the competent envoys to reach the purpose of revocation. (4) According to the Dutch notification, the case of Xiao Xin'an being defiled is being tried, and our country should send personnel to supervise the trial. If it is unfair, we will negotiate again. (5) The two cases of the Provisional Law for the Revocation of Passports have been received by the Overseas Chinese Federation and have already been instructed by the Counselor's Office to re-draft them to reduce the cost of the visa and eliminate the obstruction to help the wishes of the overseas Chinese. (6) The Immigration Office of the Dutch Territories should negotiate with the Dutch side to abuse the overseas Chinese who enter the port. (7) Kim Wen, the Governor of the British Straits Settlements, should do his best to negotiate the unwarranted exclusion of Chinese people. If the other party does not cancel the expulsion order of Mr. Zheng Luosheng, etc., when the representatives met with Foreign Minister Wang, Foreign Minister Wang said: "All circles in Shanghai are warmly involved in diplomacy. Support is most welcome to the government because with public support the government has a good say." The representatives then questioned Wang and said, "Since your department wants public assistance, why did you order Xiamen to ban the boycott of Java ships?" Wang repeatedly denied that there was no such thing. It is now reported that the representatives have returned to Shanghai and said that the results of the petition were not bad verbally, but the words of the officialdom have always been discounted. It remains to be seen whether the words and deeds of the external sector can be in harmony with each other and the facts prove it. Therefore, all sectors should continue to struggle so as not to leave a reputation for being enthusiastic for five minutes.</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu and Chen Ce Returned to Guangdong Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Zhu Jiahua Accompanied to End the Guangdong School Affairs Guangdong Provincial Government Chairman Chen Mingshu and Guangdong Provincial Fleet Commander Chen Ce left for Guangdong yesterday morning at 10:00 AM on the Japanese liner Chichibu Maru. Zhu Jiahua, the former president of Guangdong Zhongshan University and the newly appointed president of the Central University of the Capital, also took the same boat to Hong Kong. Yesterday morning, Liu Weichi, director of the Beijing-Shanghai, Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau, and Sun Xiwu, secretary-general of Chen Mingshu, and dozens of relatives and friends went to the port to see Chen and others off. Sun will stay in Shanghai for another ten days before returning to Beijing. Zhu Jiahua's trip to Guangdong is to handle the handover of Zhongshan University's school affairs. He will be delayed for two or three weeks before returning north to Beijing to take office as president of Zhongda.</p>
<h3>The China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company's Chinese Wharf Has Not Been Leased to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Support for Xiao, Anti-Dutch Association sent a letter of advice regarding the rumor that the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company was leasing its Chinese wharf to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. When the Support for Xiao, Anti-Dutch Association held its meeting, the labor union of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company's Pier No. 5 had raised this for discussion. Yesterday, a reporter from the Hua Dong News Agency specifically went to the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company to inquire about whether this was true. According to them, this information was completely inaccurate. The China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company absolutely had no intention of leasing the Chinese wharf. However, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. had previously negotiated several times, intending to lease it. During the time of the former Director Zhao last year, the company had already entrusted someone to make connections, but it was unsuccessful. Later, during the time of the acting Director Cai, they repeatedly contacted each other, but all were unsuccessful and stopped. After Director Li took office, the company also raised the issue once. Director Li completely refused. Moreover, at this time of intense anti-Dutch sentiment, the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company had already refused them before, so how could they agree to them later and be spurned by the people of the whole country? The Support for Xiao, Anti-Dutch Association also sent a letter to the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company yesterday regarding this matter, advising as follows: To the esteemed officials of the China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company, the news that Xiao Xin'an, a Chinese female teacher, was brutally raped by the first and second officers of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s steamship "Chefoo," has aroused universal indignation. In addition, the Dutch government has, over the years, massacred tens of thousands of our overseas compatriots, imprisoned and expelled countless party committee members, reporters, principals, and teachers, and extorted tens of millions of yuan in entry dock taxes and wartime income taxes. In its governing regulations for the Dutch colonies, it openly stipulates that Chinese people are an inferior race on par with the natives, which is even more unbearable. Therefore, the whole country has risen up to unanimously boycott Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s ships as a diplomatic backing. The gentlemen of your bureau love their country and their people, and will certainly sympathize with this righteous cause. However, yesterday we received Public Letter No. 39 from the labor union of your bureau's Pier No. 5, which reported that Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. was about to lease your bureau's Chinese wharf. If this is indeed the case, it is truly shocking. We hereby urgently request your bureau to immediately cancel this proposal and sever all ties with Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. in order to express public outrage, and we hope to receive a prompt reply to dispel public doubts.</p>

<h3>The Naval Reorganization Office Will Be Changed to the Shanghai Fortress Command</h3>
<p>After the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee resolved to abolish the various reorganization agencies previously established by the National Army, it is reported that the Naval Reorganization Office in this city will be closed. After the closure, it will be changed to the Shanghai Fortress Command. The old title of Naval Headquarters will also be abolished, standing on equal footing with the Mawei and Xiamen Fortress Commands in Fujian Province. It is rumored that the candidate for Commander has been internally decided to be concurrently held by the current Commander of the Training Fleet, Chen Xunyong.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Advances the Start of Winter Defense</h3>
<p>Starts Tomorrow</p>
<p>Recently, Yuan, the Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, believing that the winter season is approaching and the bandit atmosphere is uneasy, urgently ordered the early start of winter defense. Previously, he had issued an order to his subordinates to make preparations, investigate and list in detail the prosperous and remote roads and alleys in their respective jurisdictions, allocate the number of police officers, and organize several patrol teams to patrol back and forth throughout the night. Now that preparations have been completed, it is scheduled to be implemented on December 1st (i.e., tomorrow). In addition to issuing an order to all districts, stations, and teams to comply, letters have also been sent to the police departments of the British and French Concessions, as well as the defense groups of various districts and the troops stationed in various places, to implement joint defense measures, cooperating and assisting each other regardless of boundaries to protect the residents and suppress banditry. During the winter defense period, the district, station, and team leaders and police officers will be dispatched day and night, which is quite arduous. All daytime operations will be temporarily suspended to show consideration.</p>
<h3>The US Asiatic Fleet Changes Flagship</h3>
<p>Houston Replaces Pittsburgh</p>
<p>The U.S. Asiatic Fleet flagship Pittsburgh, known as the "war horse" in the U.S. Navy, is being decommissioned due to its age. It will be disarmed and auctioned off, and replaced by the new cruiser Houston as the flagship. The ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow and anchor in Manila for several months. After the new cruiser Houston takes over, it will withdraw from the Asiatic Fleet and return to the United States to be dismantled and auctioned off to the market, or used as a target for artillery and sunk in the ocean.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Refuses Donation Tax, Cargo Transportation Resumes Temporarily</h3>
<p>Yongjia County Party Headquarters Mediation</p>
<p>Tax Regulations Awaiting Ministry Order for Resolution</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ou Accumulated Goods Load First</p>
<p>The change from tariffs on foreign and Guangdong goods to unified donations in Wenzhou has aroused opposition from the merchant guilds and suspended cargo transportation. After agreeing to resume transportation on the 25th, the case suddenly reversed on the 26th, and Shanghai-Wenzhou cargo was again blocked. Yesterday, it was heard that the matter had been mediated by the Party Headquarters and cargo could be temporarily loaded. The reporter went to various parties to report the details after investigation as follows:</p>
<p>New Regulations Promulgated by the Tax Bureau Director Min of the Yongjia Unified Tax Bureau insisted that foreign and Guangdong goods be changed to unified donations, and the original tax rates would be increased by one to two times. For example, indigo, a large commodity transported from Shanghai to Wenzhou, originally paid a tax of 31.5 cents per piece, but now it has increased to 3.95 yuan, an increase of almost twelve times. Oranges, a large export commodity from Wenzhou, have also increased from 10 cents per dan to 50 cents. Other foreign and Guangdong goods have increased by six or seven times, which cannot be enumerated. Director Min notified all merchants that from now on: (1) All taxes must be paid in cash, abolishing the previous monthly settlement system. (2) The declared weight of goods must conform to the customs regulations, and excessive amounts will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Merchants Submit Request to the Ministry Wenzhou merchants, believing that the tax rates were excessive and the new regulations were too harsh, jointly requested the Chamber of Commerce to send representatives to negotiate with Min. Min expressed disbelief in the Chamber of Commerce and refused the merchants' request, insisting that the regulations must be implemented as scheduled. This aroused the second major opposition from the Wenzhou business community. On the 26th, they agreed on countermeasures: (1) The merchants will jointly telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the change from tariffs on foreign and Guangdong goods to unified donations be suspended. (2) Prepare a final measure for merchants to strike in order to express their determination. After the agreement, there was a second strike in transportation.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Acts as Mediator After the second wave of unrest occurred, the Yongjia County Party Headquarters, seeing that both the merchants and the tax authorities were going to extremes and a market strike was about to occur, sent the standing committee members of the Party Headquarters to act as mediators. They first consulted with the merchant guilds, stating that the accumulation of goods in Shanghai and Wenzhou was heavy, the end of the year was approaching, and the market would be affected. They requested that the overall situation be considered and transportation be temporarily resumed. Regarding the tax regulations, they would await orders from the Provincial Government and the Ministry of Finance. Currently, the import and export goods being loaded would have their taxes registered first, and the taxes could be kept in custody by the designated Qianzhuang or the Party Headquarters until the Ministry's orders arrived and the settlement was made. On the other hand, Director Min was also persuaded to allow merchants to load and pick up goods before the donation issue was resolved, and the number of items was registered by the bureau. After several days of negotiation, both parties finally agreed yesterday.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Cargo Transportation Begins Yesterday, the accumulated foreign and Guangdong goods in the warehouse of the Ou Yun goods have begun to be loaded. It is also reported that a large batch of kumquats that were blocked in Wenzhou can be loaded today. The strike has temporarily come to an end, but the number of Wenzhou merchants coming to Shanghai to purchase goods has been greatly reduced.</p>
<h3>Summary of Merchant Ship Incidents</h3>
<p>Jiang Da Collides in Xun, China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company Ship China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company Ship Jiang Da was heading upstream from Shanghai to Hankou. As usual, it berthed at the dock in Jiujiang to load and unload cargo. Unexpectedly, while the ship was berthed, the ship's body was impacted by the Yangtze current, and could not be stopped, causing the front of the ship to collide with the dock. Because the collision was too violent, the steering gear and other parts were damaged, and the bow cabin was also damaged. According to a telegram yesterday, the Yangtze River has entered the cabin. Now the cargo has been transferred and the damaged steering gear is being repaired there. The crew and passengers are all safe.</p>
<p>Asia Queen Delayed Due to Fog The Changxing Company's Asia Queen was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning. Unexpectedly, it encountered heavy fog after departing from Japan into the Yellow Sea. For the sake of safe navigation, the captain anchored and temporarily avoided the fog at sea, which was delayed for ten hours. It did not enter the port until 6:00 PM yesterday. It was too late to leave that day, so the company notified passengers to depart for Hong Kong this morning. The soccer player Li Huitang took this ship to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Emei Delayed in Yichang Due to Smuggling The China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company's Upper Yangtze River ship Emei was searched by inspectors from the Special Tax Office in Yichang for smuggled soil hidden in bricks on the ship. A teahouse worker named Aqing was caught on the spot and immediately arrested and sent to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. This has nothing to do with the ship, so the ship was delayed in Yichang for half a day.</p>
<h3>The Lai-Tsze Ship Wrecked in Vladivostok</h3>
<p>Crew Safe</p>
<p>The British merchant Lai-Tsze's Nanshan Mallar en route to Russia, reportedly hit a reef and sank near Vladivostok. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shipping Goods from Haizhou to Vladivostok Lai-Tsze's Nanshan Mallar has been sailing in Shanghai. This year, it was leased by the Soviet Russian Commercial Fleet and sent to Haizhou in northern Russia to load goods to Vladivostok for transshipment to China. Recently, the weather in the area has become colder, and it will soon freeze. The Soviet Russian team has released the Norwegian and French ships that were leased back to Shanghai one after another. The Nanshan Mallar was left in northern Russia because the ship was sturdy. This time, it carried a large batch of timber and marine products from Haizhou to Vladivostok and when it was sailing north of Vladivostok, near a place called Peacock Harbor, the ship encountered wind and snow and hit a hidden reef. The ship was damaged, and because there were few merchant ships traveling to and from the area, it was not possible to rescue the ship, so it sank.</p>
<p>Accident Due to Wind en Route The British merchant Lai-Tsze received a telegram from Vladivostok stating that the company's cargo ship Nanshan Mallar was carrying a large batch of timber and marine products from Haizhou in northern Russia and sailing south. When it reached 62 degrees north latitude, near Peacock Harbor, it suddenly encountered a strong wind, and the situation was very dangerous. The captain of the ship knew that disaster was imminent, so he immediately stopped the engine and dropped anchor, hoping to avoid it temporarily. Unexpectedly, the wind came after the ship anchored, and the waves were surging like mountains and seas. One wave broke the iron chains, and the ship was hit by the waves for several miles and hit the nearby beach. The ship ran aground on a hidden rocky mouth. It is currently winter, and the area is already frozen. The sea level receded, causing the Nanshan Mallar to lose its ability to move after hitting the beach.</p>
<p>The Ship Sinks into the Sand and Mud The ship first ran aground on a reef, then dislodged from the reef and entered the sandy beach. After the tide receded, the ship gradually sank into the sea sand and mud due to being fully loaded. The machinery was damaged and could not be moved. The cargo holds were also flooded. According to a telegram received by the company, Peacock Harbor will be frozen thereafter, and there is no hope of escape for the Nanshan Mallar. The crew has all left the ship, and the company's ship in Vladivostok has been dispatched to rescue them. The cargo on the deck that can be unloaded will be removed first.</p>
<p>The Crew Will Be Sent to Shanghai The captain and all the crew members abandoned ship and returned to Vladivostok because the food had run out. The sailors were all Chinese hired in Shanghai, so the company telegraphed the Soviet Russian Fleet in Vladivostok, saying that after the sailors were rescued in Vladivostok, they would be sent back to Shanghai. It is expected to arrive in mid-December, but there were no casualties, and all luggage and belongings were lost. The ship has a load capacity of 5,000 tons. It is said that the company plans to wait until the ice melts and the water rises next spring before attempting to salvage the ship.</p>
<h3>The Crew Dispute on the Japanese Merchant Ship Changfeng Resolved</h3>
<p>Seamen's Union Mediates</p>
<p>Agreement Reached, Back Pay Paid</p>
<p>The Japanese merchant Chuandong Shipping Company's Changfeng ship operates between Shanghai and Yichang, transporting passengers and cargo with great success. There are a total of more than sixty crew members in the fireman, sailor, and steward departments. Two months ago, the old manager resigned and returned to Japan, and was replaced by a Japanese named Tan Xizhi. The crew members had been owed wages for several months, but Tan Xizhi did not acknowledge them and refused to pay them. Even the wages that the crew members should have received after he took office were delayed for a long time. The crew members reported to the Seamen's General Union and requested a strike. After the union approved, it ordered all the crew members of the Changfeng ship to strike at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. At about 8:00 PM that night, the manager of the Chuandong Company (Wu Tianquezhong) was extremely panicked when he heard the news. He immediately gathered Tan Xizhi, the general manager of the Changfeng ship, Yang Junsheng, the director of the Great China Shipyard, and others to go to the Seamen's General Union on Qiujiang Road to request mediation. As a result, the Chuandong Shipping Company, the general manager of the Changfeng ship, and the Seamen's Union signed an agreement. The union then ordered all the crew members to resume work. The agreement signed by the China Seamen's Industrial Federation, the Chuandong Shipping Company, and the general manager of the Changfeng ship to resolve the payment of wages to the seamen Zhu Tingpan and others is as follows: Article 1: All wages owed to the seamen in the fireman, sailor, and steward departments of the ship up to the end of November of the 19th year of the Republic of China must be paid in full by November 27th of the same year, four-eighths of the total amount. Another one-eighth of the total amount will be paid when the ship arrives in Yichang on December 6th. The remaining three-eighths will be paid in three installments at the end of December of the same year, the end of January of the 20th year of the Republic of China, and the end of February. Article 2: The union will immediately instruct the relevant seamen on the ship to work as usual. Article 3: From December of the same year onwards, the wages of the relevant seamen in each department of the ship will be paid monthly. Article 4: The company and the general manager of the ship shall not dismiss or abuse the seamen in each department without cause in the future.

Witness: Yang Junsheng, Director of the Great China Shipbuilding Machinery Factory. Signed on November 27th of the 19th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>The Songhu Branch Line Will Be Moved to the East End of Baoshan Road</h3>
<p>Baoshan Road Has Much Convenient Transportation Baoshan Road in this city is an important transportation route in northern Shanghai. However, the Songhu Railway runs across it, and the opening and closing of the gates causes inconvenience to vehicles, horses, and pedestrians. The Municipal Government has consulted the Ministry of Railways, ordering the Railway Bureau to move the line to the east end of Baoshan Road. It is now known that the Municipal Government has approved the reply from the Ministry of Railways to move the line. It is expected that it will be implemented soon.</p>

<h3>Strange Prescription: Treating Illness with Live Snake Gallbladder</h3>
<p>Beggar Finds a Black Snake Large Snake Gives Birth to Four Small Snakes</p>
<p>Chen Guoguang, an apprentice from Chaozhou at the He Cheng Tobacco Company founded by Guangdong merchant Zheng Ziliang in the Taipingli of the French Concession's West Water and Electricity Street, has recently been suffering from eye diseases. According to doctors, he needs to take several live snake gallbladders to fully recover. The apprentice searched everywhere for snake charmer beggars and finally found a snake charmer about 40 years old yesterday morning and bought a black snake from him. They agreed that the bitter gallbladder would be taken from the live snake's abdomen, and it was stated that the live snake must not be killed with a knife, but its abdomen must be cut open with broken shards of porcelain to take the gallbladder. However, the snake was very large, about five feet long. The beggar took a shard of porcelain and cut open the snake's abdomen. Just as he was about to take the gallbladder, four small snakes about a foot long suddenly emerged from the snake's abdomen. Everyone watching was surprised. It was found that snakes are oviparous and not viviparous. It is not known how the snake suddenly produced four small snakes. As a result, the beggar took the four small snakes away. Everyone watching dispersed, saying that it was strange.</p>
<h3>The Duck Nest Sand Kidnapping Case, Captives Successfully Escape</h3>
<p>Three Generations Kidnapped, a Total of Five People</p>
<p>Three Return Home, Mother and Daughter Missing</p>
<p>Ma Xingfan (whose original surname was Lu, and who married into the Ma family), the owner of the Maxingfan Fresh Fish Shop in the Duck Nest Sand East Town of the Sanjia Water Mouth of Wusong, and his wife, daughter-in-law, grandson, and granddaughter, a total of five people, were kidnapped by Pan Guohai bandits the other day. The details were reported in this newspaper on the 22nd. It is now heard that Mrs. Ma, her seven-year-old grandson, and her five-year-old granddaughter have escaped and returned home. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mrs. Ma Plans in the Bandit Den After Mrs. Ma, her daughter-in-law, and three generations of grandchildren were kidnapped by bandits, they were sent to a thatched cottage in a village near the Hongzhen of North Beach River and hidden there. Three male bandits and an old woman over sixty years old were in charge of guarding them. Mrs. Ma saw that the four walls of the den were all made of reed mats, and planned to escape. Because she was barefoot and wearing shoes when she was kidnapped, she specially asked the bandit woman for a pair of scissors and needle and thread, claiming to make socks, but in reality, she was waiting for an opportunity to move.</p>
<p>Beating the Woman, They Escape One evening, the three male bandits guarding them heard that the anti-bandit troops were approaching and the situation was tense, so they did not dare to stay in the den and fled one after another. Only the old woman was left to guard them. Mrs. Ma saw that the opportunity had come, and instructed her daughter-in-law (Bao Shan's wife): "If you don't leave now, what are you waiting for? The children can only rely on fate." Her daughter-in-law heard this and used scissors to dig a hole. One person walked away first and went east in the dark. Mrs. Ma also escaped alone and went north. After walking less than two li, the bandit woman had already chased after her. Mrs. Ma thought to herself that she was already over sixty years old, and she was only fifty years old. She could only fight her to the death. Unexpectedly, the woman was also unwilling to show weakness. The two fought in the dark in the field for about an hour. The woman fell three times but still refused to give up. However, Mrs. Ma's chest was severely injured. Because she was anxious and afraid that male bandits would chase her, she could only push the woman down with all her strength and flee for her life. After crossing three or four li, she saw a thatched cottage and knocked on the door. There was only a poor old woman inside. Mrs. Ma explained the situation and begged for help. According to the woman, there were bandits everywhere this time, but she was very poor and could live there. If she was found out, she would definitely come looking for her. She told her to hide in the sorghum garden behind. Mrs. Ma lay in the garden and waited until dawn. The woman sent her to Chuan Hongzhen and took a boat home.</p>
<p>Two Boys and Girls Return Together After Mrs. Ma and her daughter-in-law escaped from the bandit den, the three male bandits returned after dawn. After the woman explained the situation, one of the bandits saw that one of the three children, the youngest girl (four years old), had a beautiful, exquisite, lively, and lovely appearance, so he took her away. There was also a boy (seven years old) and a girl (five years old), Guifa's children, who were hidden by the other two bandits in baskets, covered with sheets, and carried to the vicinity of Da'an Port, intending to abandon them. However, because they were hungry, they stopped in the field, and the two bandits went to the town to buy food. The boy heard that the bandits had left, so he carried his sister on his back and fled about two li to a farmer's house. He explained his address and name. The farmer reported the news. Ma Xingfan went to Da'an Port in person yesterday and took them home.</p>
<p>Bao Shan's Wife and Daughter Missing After Bao Shan's wife escaped from the bandit den, she has not returned home yet, and there is no news. Some say that she still encountered bandits on the way and was taken away, which is difficult to speculate. As for the four-year-old girl who was taken away by the bandits, there is probably no hope of getting her back. It is said to be bitter.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Between Teachers and Students of Nanyang Medical College</h3>
<p>Li Ding is the Target of the Dispute</p>
<p>Prosecutor Ge Mediates Between the Two Parties</p>
<p>The private Nanyang Medical College on Xiaoshadu Road and Wuding Road in western Shanghai was founded in the third year of the Republic of China by Dr. Miyadun Kuan, the director of the Fumin Hospital. It was not until the sixteenth year that it was completely taken over by the Chinese. The current president of the college is Wu Zongqing from Jiangxi. There are more than 400 male students and 60 to 70 female students in the college, divided into five classes. The student body is organized with Lu Yiqiu as the president of the student union, and Liu Zefu, Gao Changguo, Wang Zuo Cai, Wu Jijie, Zhang Jialong, Lin Yungui, and Zhang Shangyu as the executive committee members. Recently, the students have been dissatisfied with the president Wu Jiaqing and the dean of studies Li Ding, because they have repeatedly increased tuition fees, failed to do their job well, and failed to make the accounts public. On the 3rd of this month, the student union held a meeting and decided on several conditions to submit to President Wu. President Wu also held a meeting of faculty and staff to discuss how to deal with the situation. Everyone believed that the students should not take such actions. The next day, a notice was issued prohibiting students from engaging in such behavior in the future, otherwise the leaders would be severely punished. As soon as the notice was posted, it was torn down by the students. The faculty and staff meeting then expelled eight male and female students, including Lu and others, and wrote a notice to be posted on the 5th. At 9:00 AM that morning, all the students suddenly poured into the dean of studies' office and sealed off various parts of the school, driving away all the office staff. Two staff members, Shu Zhiquan and Zhong Zhixian, saw this situation and immediately reported to the Gordon Road Patrol Room. The head of the patrol room dispatched detectives to the school to suppress the situation. However, they only arrested Liu Zefu and questioned him before releasing him. At this time, the announcement of the expulsion of Lu and the other eight people had been posted in the school, and President Wu Jiaqing submitted a report to the Special District Local Court on the 6th, stating that the Communist Party would be holding a meeting in the school on the 10th in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Education, and should be prohibited. Therefore, he specifically requested that the court issue an order to prohibit it. As a result, the meeting on the 10th was not held. Now, Liu and the other eight people have hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to sue Wu Jiaqing in the Special Court for fabricating false reports and inciting unrest, causing Liu Fuzhe to be arrested and detained, and requested that he be punished for false accusation. Wu Jiaqing also hired two lawyers, Luo Jiaheng and Tang Mingshi, to argue that Liu was falsely accused and requested that he also be punished for false accusation. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Ge Zhitan opened the third criminal court to summon the school's male and female students to court, and hundreds of people attended the hearing. Prosecutor Ge ordered a representative to be elected because there were eight plaintiffs. Gao Changguo was elected. Gao said that because he was from Guizhou, President Wu had not done a good job, so the student union held a meeting and made demands of President Wu. Unexpectedly, he refused and expelled the eight of them. He also reported to the patrol room that they had improper actions, causing Liu Zefu to be detained for an hour. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit. The sealing of the dean of studies' office was to prevent important documents from being lost, so he was taking care of them on their behalf. The principal is currently maintaining school affairs, and the students are still attending classes as usual. The court then gave the students Wu Jiaqing's counterclaim to read. Afterwards, Wu Jiaqing was summoned. According to his供, the students had this unrest because they opposed the dean of studies Li Ding. At that time, the five conditions proposed by the student union were accepted except for the one to dismiss Li Ding. He always disclosed the school's finances to the public (the students in the audience laughed loudly when they heard Wu say this). The reason why he did not agree to dismiss Li was because the end of the semester was approaching and it was not necessary to do so. At that time, the faculty and staff meeting decided that the school's finances were audited by the board of directors and had nothing to do with the students. Considering the students' repeated unrest, it was proposed to punish them, so a notice was issued. However, the students destroyed the notice and were expelled. However, those who were expelled still occupied the school and incited unrest. He should pay attention to this. The report to the patrol room was made by Shu and Zhong. After he learned about it, he went there and Liu Zefu had already been released. Now the plaintiff said that he had fabricated false reports, which was not true. Prosecutor Ge said that it was not easy for the students to come to Shanghai to study. China has always valued the friendship between teachers and students. Now, they are fighting in court, which is not the way of teachers and students. He advised the two parties to reconcile. Gao Changguo then asked President Wu to apologize in the newspaper. Prosecutor Ge said that the plaintiffs should not have sealed off the dean of studies' office. If the defendant wanted to apologize in the newspaper, the plaintiff should do the same. At that time, Wu expressed that he could not accept apologizing in the newspaper. Prosecutor Ge then set the terms for reconciliation. The student union should apologize to Wu, and Wu should cancel the expulsion. However, because it was late, it was not possible to discuss it. The hearing was postponed.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Customs Burned a Large Amount of Opium</h3>
<p>Three Months from September 21st</p>
<p>Worth More Than 880,000</p>
<p>The Shanghai Customs held a burning of a large batch of drugs at the Lujiazui Customs Warehouse Pier in Pudong yesterday. At 9:00 AM, Commissioner Tang Naigen of the Supervisory Office, together with Tax Commissioner Ge Yixin representing the Customs Commissioner, Extra Tax Commissioner Li Du, Chief Inspector Shi Kes, Director of the Transportation Department Mo Kefu, and more than a dozen Chinese and foreign customs officers, packed morphine into 26 sacks and six wooden boxes, numbered them, and escorted them across the river. Yuan Liang, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, specially appointed Zhang Mingqin, the head of the Third District, to personally lead a platoon of armed police to the scene to protect and take care of the matter. Inspectors from various agencies arrived. Zhang Yinhuai of the Municipal Government, Ju Zhijing of the Special District Local Court, and Huang Jiamo of the Anti-Drug Association, and others, at 11:00 AM, the special commissioner for burning soil ordered the workers to dissect the drugs and verify them. After confirming that there were no errors, they began to burn them in one or two gas kilns. The smoke filled the air. By half past noon, the matter was completed. A total of 11 dan, 7 jin, 4 liang, and 5 qian of morphine, heroin, and other types, and 10 dan, 51 jin, and 14 liang of foreign soil medicine were burned, with a total estimated value of more than 883,990 yuan. The above-mentioned drugs were seized on various ships during the three months from September 21st to November 20th of this year. The large number is unprecedented.</p>
<h3>Postal Items Sent to Siberia</h3>
<p>Change in Delivery Method</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Postal Authority, the last time postal items from Shanghai to Siberia were transferred via Dalian was when they left port on the morning of the 29th of this month. After this, the Shanghai Postal Administration will send the postal items to Nanjing and the Jinpu Railway for transfer every day (the sealing time for registered mail is 19:30, and the sealing time for ordinary mail is 20:00). Incoming postal items via Siberia will also be transported by railway (i.e., from Panyang, Tianjin, Nanjing, to Shanghai).</p>
<h3>Suffering the Burden of the Three Characters "Communist Party"</h3>
<p>A Detective's Misunderstanding</p>
<p>Harasses a Printing Shop Owner</p>
<p>Recently, Jinan University experienced a student strike. The university authorities, genuinely fearing that young students would be tempted by outside influences and sacrifice their studies, printed an announcement to persuade students not to be led astray by the Communist Party, wasting their precious time on futile pursuits. The language was extremely tactful. Unexpectedly, a copy of this printed matter fell into the hands of a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Upon seeing the words "Communist Party" in the text, without taking the time to examine it closely, he assumed it was a reactionary propaganda piece and began investigating. He quickly learned that it was printed by the Dahua Printing Shop on the Beishan West Road concession boundary. Yesterday, he reported this to the Political Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police of the Public Concession and requested a search warrant. After the Director of the Political Department obtained a search warrant from the Special District Local Court, he rushed to the printing shop to conduct a search. No reactionary items were found. However, the owner of the printing shop, suddenly seeing the detectives arriving, did not know what he had done wrong and hastily fled out the back door, resulting in his wife being arrested. She was immediately taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. After Director Yuan interrogated her and clarified that the incident was a misunderstanding, he released the woman.</p>
<h3>Strange Youth Wounds People with a Blade</h3>
<p>Police Should Pay Attention to Cyclists Recently, in the Nanshi and other areas, there has been a young man, dressed in a long black robe, about twenty years old, riding a bicycle back and forth on various roads. Whenever he encounters young, beautiful, and fashionable women or female students, he rides up to them and, taking advantage of their unpreparedness, suddenly pulls out a sharp blade and forcefully slashes at their faces. The women, having been injured for no reason, suffer extreme pain, bleed profusely, and cry out loudly. The youth then speeds away, making it impossible to apprehend him. Several such incidents have been discovered in recent days, causing everyone who hears about it to be amazed. Yesterday afternoon, around six o'clock, a beautiful young girl, about ten years old, was walking near Qiao Jia Zha in Xiaonanmen when she suddenly encountered this strange youth, whom she did not know. He unexpectedly pulled out a sharp blade from his clothing and slashed it across her face before fleeing. The girl cried out in pain, and nearby residents, hearing the sound, rushed out to give chase, but the strange youth and his bicycle had long since disappeared without a trace. People say that the strange youth uses these cruel and ruthless methods to target fashionable women and female students, but no one knows what his motivation is, which is truly perplexing.</p>
<h3>Twenty-Seven Labor Unions Declare on the Xin Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday, twenty-seven labor unions, including the Shanghai Tea Industry Labor Union, issued a declaration regarding the tragic death of Xin Dingxiang, stating: (Xin Dingxiang was a member of our Chinese nation. Now, he has unfortunately died tragically under the iron hooves of French imperialist sailors. All Chinese people share a common feeling of grief and indignation. However, it is unexpected that since the occurrence of this tragic case, a long period of time has passed. The family's sorrowful cries have not been heeded. The citizens of the laboring class have not received the attention of humanity worldwide. The deceased harbors resentment in the afterlife, and the living swallow their voices on the road. Meanwhile, the French imperialists maintain their aggressive ambitions and use their strong-arm tactics to disregard this tragic case, treating our Chinese people almost like dogs. This is intolerable! Our labor unions, connected by the ties of compatriots and sharing the principle that all within the four seas are brothers, are willing to lead all workers to prepare to deal with the French imperialists before this tragic case is properly resolved, upholding the determination of justice prevailing over might and striving for equality for the nation. If we do not avenge this vendetta, we will not hesitate to make even greater sacrifices. Therefore, we swear in the end: Endure hardship and determination to open a bloody path, united in hatred, preferring glorious death to humiliating life. This declaration is submitted for your public consideration. Shanghai Tea Industry Labor Union, Postal Workers Union, Inland Steamboat Workers Union, Newspaper Delivery Workers Union, Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Workers Union, Steamboat Wood Industry Workers Union, Book and Cheap Fan Workers Union, Pharmacy Workers Union, Commercial Press Distribution Office Workers Union, China Merchant Electric Workers Union, Pharmaceutical Industry Workers Union, British American Tobacco Workers Union, Huacheng Tobacco Workers Union, French Water and Electricity Workers Union, China Seamen's Union, China Merchants Bureau No. 5 Wharf Workers Union, Sanyou Industrial Society Workers Union, etc., twenty-seven labor unions.</p>
<h3>Han and Ye's Dissolution of Marriage Will Depend on Syphilis</h3>
<p>Han Zhiqing, from Cixi, Ningbo, currently works as a surveyor at the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau. He is twenty-three years old this year. In March of the seventeenth year of the Republic (1928), he was betrothed through a matchmaker to Li Juan, the granddaughter of Ye Maozhen (also known as Fengming), an employee of the Qingjie Hall on Penglai Road, Nanhui. The matchmaker from the groom's side notified the bride's side to select a date for the wedding. Unexpectedly, the bride's side sternly refused, showing signs of breaking off the engagement. Therefore, Han Zhiqing hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the local court to enforce the marriage contract, demanding confirmation of the validity of the marriage contract and immediate wedding arrangements. The defendant, Ye Maozhen, also hired a lawyer to file a defense. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Guo Shouyi specially opened the seventh courtroom to hear the case. The plaintiff, Han Zhiqing, testified that he was twenty-three years old, currently residing at No. 1, opposite Yuanshang Lane, Ningbo Road, in the French Concession. On April 3, 1928, according to the solar calendar, his father, Han Shiwang, arranged the engagement with the defendant's granddaughter through a matchmaker. His father is currently working in Shandong and has come to Shanghai to prepare for the wedding. He had asked the matchmaker from his side to inform the defendant, but the defendant firmly insisted on breaking off the engagement. However, when the engagement was made in the past, four pieces of gold jewelry were sent, including two gold rings, a gold ear pick, a gold bracelet, and four gold hairpins, as well as 48 yuan in ritual money. He requested that the marriage contract be upheld. Next, the defendant, Ye Maozhen, testified that he was sixty-seven years old, a native of Nanhui, residing in the Dujiahang township in Pudong, and had been serving at the Qingjie Hall. His granddaughter, Li Juan, is twenty-three years old this year and was born to his second son. It is true that the engagement was made in the past.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>However, the plaintiff was very undisciplined. Our family recommended him to work at the Land Bureau. Unexpectedly, the plaintiff's character was very bad and he liked to frequent prostitutes. The four pieces of gold jewelry at the time of the engagement were indeed correct. However, the 48 yuan was not ritual money but money for festive snacks. There is evidence presented in the case (a private letter in which the plaintiff wrote to Shen Fengmei, stating that they agreed to meet at a certain date at your entertainment venue after their separation this morning, with some inappropriate content). The judge read it and asked the defendant where this letter came from. He replied that my grandson also works at the Land Bureau. In December of the year before last, someone (said to be the girl's parent) brought the letter to the Land Bureau to negotiate with Han Zhiqing. At that time, my grandson and others mediated to resolve the matter, so this letter ended up in my hands. I really hoped that he would change, so I tolerated it until now. Now my granddaughter, Li Juan, opposes this marriage because she had never agreed to it at the time. The judge then questioned the plaintiff, asking with whom this letter was exchanged. He replied that it was a classmate from Tianjin when I was studying there, and we agreed to meet at Wing On Company after meeting at the train station. The judge said, "You are very undisciplined, otherwise, why would the bride's side break off the engagement? Now that she doesn't want to marry you, there is nothing you can do." He replied, "My relatives and friends all know that reputation is important." The judge said, "She herself is unwilling, so she cannot be forced." He replied, "I must be compensated for my reputational damage." The judge said, "This letter clearly states that you parted in the morning and will meet in the evening. What kind of reputational damage can be compensated?" He replied, "This letter was in my desk and was taken by the defendant's grandson." The judge said, "Then he leaked your secret. You can sue him." The judge then asked the defendant when his granddaughter could come to court. He replied, "Please allow one week for her to appear in court. Please, Your Honor, pay attention that the plaintiff suffers from syphilis. I request an examination." The judge said, "If you request an examination, you should pay the examination fee." He replied, "I am willing to pay." The judge said to the plaintiff, "Do you live at No. 1 Ningbo Road?" He replied, "Yes." The judge said, "Await notification from this court for the examination." He then advised the lawyers of both parties that it would be best to settle out of court within three days. If they could not settle, then he would allow an examination to determine whether the plaintiff had syphilis, based on which a decision would be made. The court was then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Zhai Xiuying and Shen Rongzong Case</h3>
<p>The Plaintiff's Claim is Rejected</p>
<p>Zhai Shufan, style name Han Chen, a broker at the Silk Cocoon Association, has an adopted daughter named Xiuying, currently residing at No. 199 Changkang Lane, Alabaster Road. On February 27th of this year, according to the lunar calendar, she married Shen Rongzong of Fudan University. Recently, she hired lawyer Lu Qi to file a lawsuit in the Special District Local Court seeking to dissolve the marriage. The defendant appeared in court yesterday, accompanied by his lawyer Xu Bingcheng, and presented arguments and rebuttals. The plaintiff's lawyer requested a judgment of divorce according to the law, while the defendant's lawyer argued that the plaintiff's claims of abuse must be based on evidence and that serious insults cannot be made without substantiation. He requested that the court order the two parties to live together again and restore their affection, and he presented various pieces of evidence. Judge Yang, after hearing the case, used a love letter from Zhai Xiuying to the defendant as evidence. He then questioned the defendant about whether he wanted the person or the property. The defendant replied that the whole matter was due to the plaintiff being young, naive, and weak-willed, and that her father was not her biological father and was harming his daughter. The court announced that a verdict would be issued on the morning of the 29th of this month. Today, the court ruled that the plaintiff's claim was rejected and that the plaintiff was responsible for the litigation costs.</p>
<h3>A Cigarette Cask Breaks a Pelvis</h3>
<p>A Grievous Injustice for Su Lugui</p>
<p>Su Lugui, a native of Jiangbei, resided at No. 77, North Baoding Lane, Des Voeux Road, Hongkou. Su Lugui, forty-one years old, had been working as a foreman at the Huacheng Tobacco Company. Yesterday morning, around eleven o'clock, the company ordered him to transport cigarette paper to the Medici Trading Company on Huacheng Road. There were over a hundred cigarette casks stored in the warehouse, each weighing over a thousand catties and stacked about ten feet high. While Su was moving them, one of the casks on top fell, striking Su directly and breaking his pelvis, causing his large intestine to protrude. His colleagues quickly moved the cask aside and urgently hired a vehicle to take Su Lugui to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Due to ineffective rescue efforts, he died around two o'clock in the afternoon. The hospital sent his body to the coroner's office to await an examination.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Russian Contractor Incident</h3>
<p>A Russian, Guo Tesi Ding, subcontracted the construction project of the new building at No. 421 Yu Garden Road, which he had contracted, to Zhang Zhongwei's Chinese construction company. On the 12th of the month, plasterers and carpenters clashed with Guo over the calculation of wages. Guo fired a gun, injuring a worker in the head. He was arrested by the police and transferred to the Shanghai Local Court, which fined him thirty yuan the day before. After the conflict, the police also arrested Cao Deyuan, the driver of the Wanguo Automobile Company's car that took Guo to the police station, and transferred him to the Special District Local Court, accusing him of obstructing Guo's freedom. He was ordered to post a bond of two thousand yuan pending trial. Details have been reported previously. Yesterday morning, Judge Sun Yuan continued the hearing. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the Yu Garden Road project was originally contracted by the British engineer Tie Lan. Later, after several transfers, it was finally contracted by Zhang Zhongwei. Therefore, Zhang should be responsible for paying the wages. Unexpectedly, on the 12th of this month, when Guo and Tie were surrounded by five or six workers, the defendant's car was parked by the roadside and tried to pull Guo into the car. Guo resisted and saw that the crowd had grown to thirty or forty people. He defended himself by striking the head of one person with the handle of his handgun. However, more people gathered, and one person with an iron rod struck Guo's arm, causing the gun to fall to the ground. Guo was then dragged into the car. The defendant was at the scene and witnessed it, so he should not have driven the car. If he had driven the car to the Jing'an Temple police station, the subsequent events would not have occurred. When Guo arrived at the Sixth District Public Security Bureau, Zhang Zhongwei and his lawyer were already there, as if they had foreseen this scene. At that time, the police had received a report and sent officers to the Sixth District, requesting that a thousand people be brought back for trial by your court. However, Zhang Zhongwei's lawyer objected. Later, they were transferred to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Guo requested to be released on bail, but it was rejected. After being detained for two hours, he was transferred to the city court. It was not until the 12th that a verdict was reached. The police had previously requested your court to transfer three people from the interior, Zhang Guifang, Hua Guanhua, and Hua Asi, but all three have not been brought in. This is truly regrettable. He also presented the invoice for the car rental from Wanguo Automobile Company to prove that the car was hired by Zhang Zhongwei because the invoice was written with Zhang Zhongwei's name. Then, the Russian, Guo Ersiding, translated and stated that he was fifty-four years old and lived at No. 121 Huanlong Road. Judge Sun first instructed him that the current trial was for obstructing freedom and whether the defendant had committed the crime of obstructing freedom. Your dissatisfaction with the prisons in the interior and all other issues were irrelevant to this case and did not need to be mentioned. Guo then explained the subcontracting process, saying that Zhang Zhongwei should be paid 35,000 taels for the construction, of which 27,000 had already been paid, leaving 8,000 unpaid because the contract stipulated that 4,000 would be paid after the entire project was completed and another 4,000 would be paid six months after completion. However, Zhang insisted on getting the money before completion and demanded 5,000 taels. I refused, which led to a dispute. Tie Lan and others then arrived to testify. Cao testified that the car was rented by the accountant in the factory and that he did not see the fight. The court ordered Cao to remain on his original bail and adjourned the hearing until next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Lu Renjia, Unemployed, Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>The Poison is Deep, and There is Probably No Hope of Survival</p>
<p>Lu Renjia, a native of Kunshan, twenty-six years old, used to work in the foreign goods industry. Due to prolonged unemployment and increasing financial pressure, he suddenly had the idea of ending his life. He went to the Dong'an Hotel in Jiuan Lane, Wuma Road, the night before last and opened Room 22, secretly swallowing a large amount of opium in an attempt to end his life. Until 12:50 yesterday afternoon, when the tea attendant knocked on the door to wake him up, Lu was already completely unconscious, lying stiffly on the bed. A suicide note was left on the table, stating that he was suffering from the pain of unemployment and economic pressure, and that life was worse than death. The hotel accountant reported this to the Central Police Station, and the detective immediately ordered a detective to investigate. The guest was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor's diagnosis, the poisoning was too deep, and there was probably no hope of survival.</p>
<h3>Why Did Wang E'e Throw Herself into the River?</h3>
<p>She Does Not Answer When Asked</p>
<p>Around four o'clock yesterday morning, as the dawn was breaking, Bu Xianshun, a petitioning police officer from the Gaochang Temple Waterworks in Nanshi, was on duty in front of the gate when he suddenly heard a loud splash near the riverbank. Knowing that something was amiss, he immediately called Li Shilin, the night watchman of the factory, to investigate. They saw a person had fallen into the river and immediately tried to rescue them. They saw that the person was wearing a dark blue serge camel-hair robe, barefoot, with a crew cut. When asked why she had thrown herself into the river, she remained silent. She was immediately sent to the Gaochang Temple substation and then to the 22nd District Headquarters. After a brief interrogation by District Chief Wang, she stated her name was Wang E'e, twenty years old, from Ningbo, but answered nothing else. District Chief Wang had no choice but to prepare a document and send her to the headquarters for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Hanlun's Reputation Loss Due to Cigarette Brand</h3>
<p>Worth 30,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Movie star Wang Hanlun previously hired a lawyer to represent her in the Civil Court of the French Concession, suing Zhang Xinliang, manager of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company, for manufacturing and selling Wang Hanlun-branded cigarettes without the plaintiff's consent, seeking compensation for reputational damage of 30,000 yuan. Yesterday, another hearing was held. First, the defendant's lawyer stated that these cigarettes were actually manufactured by Chen Luhao, manager of the Jianhua Company, and ordered from the Fuxin Tobacco Company to be used as gifts and not sold in the market. Moreover, the Court has clearly verified that the Jianhua Company did not cause any damage to the plaintiff's reputation. He requested that the case be dismissed. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that a person's reputation is priceless. Why didn't the defendant use his own wife and daughters as trademarks instead of using someone else's name as a trademark? Isn't this a reputational damage? Furthermore, my lawyer sent a letter to the Cigarette Unified Tax Bureau, which proved that the defendant's company paid the tax. The defendant should be fully responsible. My lawyer also found that a few years ago, a certain tobacco company used the name of Lu Meiyu as a cigarette brand, and Lu Meiyu filed a lawsuit and received compensation for damages. This case is the same as the Lu Meiyu case and should be granted compensation for damages. Presiding Judge Gong ordered them to withdraw and await the verdict.</p>
<h3>The Lawsuit for One Yuan in Damages is Dismissed</h3>
<p>Gu Qinghuang of the Wanguo Sports Association Sues Tan Yasheng Gu Qinghuang, son of Gu Didi, a comprador for the Korean Bank and a member of the Wanguo Sports Association, was expelled from the association by the general secretary of the association, Tan Yasheng, on the grounds of unpaid membership fees. Gu, dissatisfied, hired a lawyer to sue Tan in the Special District Local Court, seeking to recover one yuan in damages and requesting a public apology in the newspaper. The defendant hired a lawyer to defend himself. The trial has already concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Yang Yi took the stand in the Tenth Civil Court and announced the verdict, stating that the plaintiff's claim was dismissed and that the plaintiff was responsible for the litigation costs.</p>
<h3>Brothers Arguing Over Property</h3>
<p>For One Mu, Six Li, and Nine Hao of Land Chen Jiayou hired a lawyer to represent him in the Civil Court of the Public Concession yesterday, claiming that the plaintiff's deceased father, Shenghua, had three sons. The eldest son is the plaintiff, Jiayou, the second son is Jiade, and the third son is Jiamou. During the second year of Xuantong (1910), the property was divided. At that time, because the plaintiff's mother loved the third son, Jiamou, the division agreement was only signed by my client. Therefore, the contents were not detailed. It was not until now that it was discovered that there was a piece of land within the Shangyi Twenty-Fifth Bao Fourth Tu, registered in the British Land Registry, measuring one mu, six li, and nine hao. This property was not divided at that time and should be divided now, according to law. The defendant, Chen Jiamou, was also represented by a lawyer, who argued that this property was actually owned by my client and should be his. It was originally Old Land Deed No. 2034. Now, because the house has been rebuilt, it has been transferred to New Land Deed No. 186, so a declaration was published in the newspaper. The plaintiff's claim is completely unreasonable and should be dismissed. Presiding Judge Gong ordered them to wait for further verification.</p>
<h3>The Wusong Fortress Seizes Thieves</h3>
<p>A Large Number of Stolen Goods The Kangtai steamboat, which sank in the waters of the Three Gorges outside Wusongkou, was salvaged by the Japanese Tokyo Salvage Company under the commission of the Jianghai Customs. The project has now been completed. All the salvaged timber, iron, and other materials, worth tens of thousands of gold, are piled up in the open space of the Wusong Battery Taipoo Bureau, waiting for merchants to bid on them. Unexpectedly, half of the salvaged goods were stolen by nearby thieves a few days ago, causing a loss of about ten thousand taels of gold. The matter was learned by Supervisor Liu of the Jianghai Customs. Considering that the thieves dared to steal from the national treasury, if they were not strictly arrested and investigated, they would surely sell everything off. Therefore, he sent a letter to Commander Deng of the Wusong Fortress a few days ago, requesting a strict crackdown and pursuit. After receiving the letter, Commander Deng immediately sent detectives to investigate secretly in the vicinity. Yesterday morning, they arrested the thieves Xu Afa and Lu Laifa in Jiangdong and seized a large amount of the stolen goods. They were immediately taken back to the headquarters for interrogation. The two criminals confessed to stealing the goods from the sunken Kangtai steamboat and revealed the names of several accomplices. After verifying the confession, the department immediately notified Supervisor Liu of the Jianghai Customs to send personnel to Song to receive and count the seized stolen goods for verification.</p>
<h3>Municipal Finance Bureau Revises the Rating of Freight Vehicle Tax Donations</h3>
<p>The Municipal Finance Bureau recently, in order to equalize the tax burden of various car merchants in the city, specially consulted with the Public Works Bureau to revise the tax donation rating, which was submitted to the municipal government for approval and issued a bulletin yesterday, stating: "For the purpose of issuing a bulletin, it has been found that the tax donations for freight vehicles in this city have always been divided into two types, large and small, which is not fair. The revised method is to divide them into grades for tax collection: (1) Tiger cars are in the first grade, with a monthly donation of one yuan of silver. (2) Box cars, flour cars, soy sauce cars, and firewood cars are in the second grade, with a monthly donation of three yuan of silver. (3) Collapsible cars are in the third grade, with a monthly donation of five yuan of silver. Regardless of whether the freight vehicle or small car fails to report the donation after three months, the car number will be canceled. This will be implemented uniformly from January of the 20th year of the Republic. In addition to ordering the various tax collection offices of this bureau to comply, this bulletin is issued for public knowledge."</p>
<h3>Three German Boy Scouts Arrive in Shanghai After Walking Around the World</h3>
<p>Three German Boy Scouts, Kaichi, Siles, and Garbai, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday after walking around the world for six years. The three of them set off from Frankfurt, Germany, in 1924, passing through Europe, North Africa, and Asia Minor. Then, they entered South America via the West Indies, traveling south to Argentina, crossing the Andes, reaching Chile, and then traveling north along the coast, riding horses through the Central American republics and reaching Mexico. They then crossed the ocean from the United States to Honolulu, Japan. Suddenly, they were afflicted by the pain demon and had no choice but to pack their bags and return home for treatment. After recovering, they set off again in October of this year, taking the route through Siberia, visiting famous cities in North China and Korea, and arriving in Shanghai. Along the way, they relied on income from lectures to cover travel expenses. They now plan to give a speech at the German General Association in this port, recounting their experiences along the way.</p>

<h3>Chinese Music Created by Westerners Will Be Performed Tonight</h3>
<p>Municipal Hall Orchestra</p>
<p>At the Grand Guangming Theater</p>
<p>Last Sunday night, the Municipal Hall Orchestra's performance of Mr. Huang Jinwu's "Nostalgic Tune" caused a sensation in the Chinese and Western music circles. Tonight (the 30th), the orchestra will perform the Russian Ya Xia Luomov's "The Spirit of Jin Sai." Ya was born in Siberia and graduated from the University of Switzerland. Later, he traveled to the United States and lived in the city of Boutran. He lived in Beiping, China, for nine years, carefully studying Chinese music. After returning to the United States, he created this song. The song has been performed repeatedly in the United States. The song quotes many Chinese folk songs and contains a strong oriental flavor. Tonight's performance should attract the attention of Chinese musicians.</p>
<h3>Two Railway Administrations Convene a Business Conference</h3>
<p>December 5th The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations sent letters to various commercial and transportation organizations regarding the convening of a business conference, stating: "We are writing to inform you that the freight transportation on our two railways has not been able to develop fully due to various obstacles over the years. Merchants and railways have both suffered. Now that the military is settled, the freight transportation on the two railways urgently needs to be rectified. In addition to the necessary affairs within the scope of our railway, which have long been planned and improved and are underway, any difficulties that merchants have in transportation that need to be discussed and assisted should be jointly discussed and thoroughly improved in order to achieve cooperative benefits. It is planned to invite responsible representatives from relevant agencies and merchants, banks, and transshipment companies along our railway line to come to our bureau to hold a business conference to discuss and study. In addition to sending separate letters, we hereby write to inform your bureau, respectfully requesting you to investigate and select a responsible representative to come to our bureau before January 5th to participate in the discussion. If you have any written opinions, please send them to the Traffic Department of our railway one week before the meeting for discussion and collection of opinions. We will be grateful for your efforts."</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Requests Exchange of Central Temporary Exchange Vouchers</h3>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing yesterday, stating: "Respectfully addressed to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing. On the 27th of this month, we received a letter from the Joint Association of Holders of Temporary Exchange Vouchers of the Central Bank, stating (the original letter has been recorded in a previous newspaper): 'We have long admired your association as a leader in the business community and a hub of the financial industry. Therefore, we dare to send a special letter, respectfully requesting your sympathetic assistance,' etc. It has been found that these temporary exchange vouchers were brought here when the National Army settled in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and were used to pay the soldiers' salaries. At that time, orders were repeatedly issued that they should be used on the market and treated as cash, and discounts were not allowed. A large number of them were distributed among the people. Later, Wuhan issued an order to concentrate cash and stop the exchange, which led to Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces also being affected and stopping the use. At that time, these exchange vouchers were all intercepted and sealed by the chambers of commerce in various places in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to await the government to prepare a solution. Unexpectedly, after that, the long-term financial public bonds of the 17th year were issued, and the exchange vouchers of the Hankou Central Bank and the Xiang-E ocean vouchers and silver dollar vouchers were all approved for exchange into bonds for repayment in installments. Only these temporary exchange vouchers have not been discussed. Inquiries were repeatedly sent by the former General Chamber of Commerce to your department, but no substantive instructions were received. Compared to the two, it is really regrettable. According to the previous situation in the letter, the 22nd regular meeting of the association was resolved on the 27th of this month to submit a case to your department for the record. It is reasonable to record the case and request your department to consider arranging a fixed exchange method, which will be approved and implemented immediately, so as to avoid the national currency, which was regarded as cash on the day, becoming waste paper. This would be a great favor. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows in gratitude."</p>
<h3>立法院派員來滬調查商工業</h3>
<p>The Legislative Yuan has dispatched personnel to Shanghai to investigate commerce and industry.</p>
<p>A letter was sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce introducing Zhang Zongbi and Liang Yincho, specially appointed by the Statistics Department of the Legislative Yuan, to come to Shanghai to investigate the current state of Shanghai's commerce and industry. The letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reads: "Esteemed Sirs, The prosperity or decline of a country's commerce and industry is vitally related to the livelihood of its people. In recent years, China's industry has been sluggish, and the impact of the gold rush has caused deep damage. Public and private sectors are preoccupied with seeking ways to maintain themselves. However, due to the lack of statistical data, it is difficult to assess the cause of the problem. It is difficult to improve or rescue the situation. The Statistics Department, recognizing this, intends to conduct a detailed investigation of domestic industry, commerce, finance, and other economic situations, and study the phenomenon of business cycles, to prepare for the compilation of statistical data from the past few decades, so as to provide reference for the public and private sectors and to thoroughly resolve the problem. Therefore, we are sending staff members Zhang Zongbi, Chen Zhongle, and Weng Changxi, and investigators Liang Yincho, Peng Yi, and Liu Houyuan, etc. to investigate the current state of Shanghai's commerce and industry. We are writing to your esteemed Chamber to request your support and to forward letters to various trade associations for introductions, so as to facilitate the work. We would be most grateful. Respectfully, To the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>市商會集議赴印調查商業</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened a meeting to discuss sending a delegation to India to investigate commerce.</p>
<p>明日重行開會</p>
<p>Another meeting will be held tomorrow.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce convened a general meeting of trade associations and factory representatives on the 19th of this month to discuss the investigation of commerce in India. However, due to the small number of attendees, it was unanimously decided to hold a discussion meeting instead. The principles were completely approved, and the results of the discussion were decided by the 21st Standing Committee meeting to convene a meeting of various trade associations and manufacturers related to trade with India to discuss the implementation methods. It is reported that the Chamber has set a meeting for 2:00 PM on December 1st (next Monday) in the Standing Committee Room on the third floor of the Chamber. As it is related to the promotion of overseas trade, the Chamber has specially dispatched staff member Zhu Dechao to various trade associations and manufacturers to personally discuss the matter and request that responsible representatives be sent to attend on time.</p>
<h3>全國商聯會請開大會</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce requests to convene a general meeting.</p>
<p>舉陳理由四端 The reasons are presented in four points.</p>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China submitted a document to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday, stating: "Submitted for listing four points, requesting permission to convene the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China as soon as possible. It is humbly submitted that the Federation had previously decided to convene the first session of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China on October 1st of this year. It has been reported separately to the Central Party Department and the Ministry for record. Subsequently, after receiving approvals and rejections, the Federation has again submitted the handling process for permission, and received a reply from the Ministry that it has been forwarded to the Central Government for review and compliance. As the days have passed and no approval has been received, the Federation is at a loss. It is humbly submitted that now that unification has been completed and national affairs have been settled, the Federation must convene a general meeting of members. The four points are hereby presented to the Ministry: Firstly, the warlords partitioned the country, causing commerce and industry to be displaced, leading to the decline of markets and the stagnation of commerce and industry in various regions. Now that the military affairs have been quelled, a national merchants' meeting should be convened to gather ideas and seek ways to promote progress. This is the first reason why a general meeting of members should be convened. Secondly, with the internal strife gone and national difficulties alleviated, our government is striving for construction after destruction. Our merchants should concentrate their efforts to be the government's support. The Federation, as the central hub for merchants nationwide, has the responsibility to assist the government in jointly planning construction and to lead merchants in jointly seeking revitalization. Without a sound organization, it is difficult to fulfill this responsibility. This is the second reason why a general meeting of members should be convened. Thirdly, China's commerce and industry are stagnant, and domestic goods are declining. Foreign economic aggression is intensifying. How can we plan for development internally? How can we plan for resistance externally? We should gather merchants nationwide to jointly strategize. This is the third reason why a general meeting of members should be convened. Fourthly, the Third Session of the Fourth Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang decided to convene a National Assembly on May 1st of next year. Our merchants have the responsibility to participate. How can we support the Party's rule from above? How can we alleviate commercial difficulties from below and contribute to the National Assembly? If we do not first convene a national merchants' meeting, there is no way to gather support. This is the fourth reason why a general meeting of members should be convened. In summary, convening the first session of the general meeting of members is urgent. The reasons for convening the general meeting of members are hereby presented to the Ministry for review and approval. We earnestly request that it be forwarded to the Central Party Department for review and swift approval, which would be in the public interest."</p>
<h3>房產公會明日開會</h3>
<p>The Real Estate Association will hold a meeting tomorrow.</p>
<p>决定應否承認自來水加價 To decide whether to acknowledge the increase in water prices.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Real Estate Association received a letter from the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association of the Foreign Concession, stating: "In response to your letter, the accounts of the Shanghai Waterworks Company have been examined by Mr. He DeKui, Mr. Pan Xulun, and Mr. Yu Xiji. The report has been prepared and sent to the Association. As the case was previously entrusted to the three gentlemen by your Association, we will not send another representative to examine the accounts. We should now send the report to your Association for review and guidance." After receiving the letter, the Real Estate Association immediately sent letters to its members, stating: "We have scheduled a members' meeting at our Association on December 1st (Monday) at 4:00 PM to discuss the review report of the Shanghai Waterworks Company's accounts and to decide whether to acknowledge the price increase. This matter concerns the drinking water of all residents. We hereby request that you attend the meeting at that time to discuss the matter. Please send a fully authorized representative."</p>
<h3>房捐特證登記處成立</h3>
<p>A special registration office for house tax certificates has been established.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Finance Bureau was ordered to collect two months' worth of house rent in Zhabei and Nanshi to supplement the national government's economic difficulties. The order has now expired. The Bureau found that many landlords in the northern and southern parts of the city have special house tax certificates but have not officially registered them. A special registration office for house tax certificates has now been established near Panfang on Penglai Road. The office officially opened for business yesterday morning and posted a sign to facilitate registration for those with special certificates.</p>
<h3>濬浦局籌浚神灘</h3>
<p>The Dredging Bureau plans to dredge the Shen Tan shoal.</p>
<p>先從籌欵入手 Start by raising funds.</p>
<p>When Mr. Heide Hansen was the chief engineer of the Dredging Bureau, he invited river engineering experts and technicians from various countries to China in 1921 to investigate the harbor channels and improve the design of the Shanghai port. He organized a technical committee and presented a detailed report to Chinese and foreign officials. Point 2 of Article 10 of the report stated: "A channel should be dredged and maintained at the Shen Tan shoal, gradually developed to meet the required and achievable depth and width, and a channel with a bottom width of 600 feet should be constructed in the shortest possible time, so that ships with a draft of 33 feet can sail safely during small spring tides." The report is now over nine years old. The tonnage and draft of ships have greatly increased, but the dredging of the Shen Tan shoal has not yet been started, which has greatly delayed larger ships due to the limited water depth. Therefore, Mr. Weijinson, chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Conference, Mr. Fangdun, chairman of the New York Shipping Bureau, and Mr. Dunken, chairman of the Pacific Shipping Bureau, submitted their opinions to the British and American Chamber of Commerce, and the former Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce also sent a letter to the Dredging Bureau, advocating the swift opening of the Shen Tan shoal to facilitate navigation for a permanent solution. This time, Mr. Ge Lin, the secretary of the Dredging Bureau, based on a letter from the British and American Chamber of Commerce forwarded by the Inspector General of Customs, specially convened key figures from the Chinese and foreign shipping industries to a meeting at the Bureau. Those present that day included foreign officials Weijinson, Bureau Chief Engineer Charlie, Secretary Ge Lin, Chinese officials Bureau Director Song Ziliang, Secretary Guo Dehua, and shipping merchants Yu Qiaqing, Zhao Jinqing, and Wang Yansong. It was reported that the main content of the meeting was that Shanghai is one of the largest ports in the world, and the tonnage and draft of merchant ships from various countries have doubled in recent years. If the Shen Tan shoal is not dredged as soon as possible, the delay will not only affect shipping merchants, but the interests of the port will also be greatly harmed. However, the Bureau has long had a detailed plan for dredging the Shen Tan shoal. This project is large and the cost is huge, which cannot be completed in a short period of time. The hidden sand of the Shen Tan shoal is completely different from other sandbars. Although the surface may be hidden or visible, the riverbed has roots. The Bureau's existing machinery, such as dredgers, are not suitable. It is necessary to refer to Dutch river dredging equipment, specially make large mud scrapers and dredgers, and build several large tows. Large-scale dredging will take several years to complete. This matter is of great importance and the Bureau's funds are insufficient. It is estimated that the cost of dredging the Shen Tan shoal will be millions of dollars. If funding is available, the project can be carried out. After the dredging, ships with a draft of more than 33 feet can travel smoothly. There is a great relationship in terms of time and economy. The meeting also vaguely revealed that the first step would be to raise funds.</p>
<h3>本月份警餉已發放</h3>
<p>The police salaries for this month have been issued.</p>

This Chamber will report to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record. In the future, if any violations of this resolution are discovered, such as impersonation, the offender will be considered a public enemy and all fellow merchants will not trade with them, and the case will be reported to the Bureau for punishment. Those who have already made transactions should register with the Chamber immediately. We will immediately report to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for record and issue a notice. It is of utmost importance that all fellow merchants be informed and strictly abide by it."</p>
<h3>粤同鄉間之强姦訴訟</h3>
<p>A rape lawsuit between fellow Cantonese.</p>
<p>一面說誘至大世界灌酒 One side claims seduction and drugging at the Great World.</p>
<p>一面說極純潔友誼交往 The other side claims purely innocent friendship.</p>
<p>Li Baoshu, a 25-year-old Cantonese bookkeeper at the Meiyuan Restaurant on Fuzhou Road, was recently accused of rape and abduction by Wu Xuehua, a fellow Cantonese woman, and her mother, Zhong, in the Special District Local Court. Li's younger sister, Rong Nun, 19 years old, is also implicated. The case was heard yesterday in the third court of the Special Court, presided over by Judge Wu Tingqi. According to the plaintiff Wu Xuehua's complaint, she met Li Baoshu through a woman named Lu at the Dachina Sock Factory last year. On September 18 of that year, Li and his sister Rong Nun went to the Great World with Wu. Li then drugged Wu with alcohol, causing her to become unconscious. When she woke up, she was lying in bed with her lower body soiled. Li then comforted her and told her not to make a sound, hence the accusation. The defendant Li Baoshu stated that his friendship with Wu was purely innocent and that there was absolutely no drugging and raping Wu at the Great World. Judge Wu then retrieved and reviewed the correspondence between Li and Wu submitted as evidence. He asked Wu, "The words in your letters to Li are quite affectionate. Why didn't you mention the rape?" Wu Xuehua replied, "Because Li coaxed me not to reveal it." Judge Wu asked if Li Baoshu could manipulate her. Wu Xuehua could not answer. She then said that on June 23, Li Baoshu told her uncle that he would apologize and admit his mistake to her uncle. Her words were overheard by others in the dock. Li's rape was undisputable. Li Baoshu then said that he went to Wu's uncle's place only to acknowledge their good friendship, and that he had said he and Wu Xuehua agreed that they could cooperate and get engaged in the future. Wu Hanzhi, 40 years old, Cantonese, Wu Zhong's brother, testified that Wu Xuehua was his niece and that last month he and his sister-in-law Wu Zhong went to the lawyer's office and he heard his sister-in-law and niece talk about Li Baoshu raping his niece and that they would negotiate with Li. Women Zhang Miao and Li Jishen also testified to what they saw. The plaintiff's lawyer Pan Zhenya and the defendant's lawyer Lin Yingqing then began their arguments. The court then asked the defendant if he had any comments. Li still absolutely denied any improper behavior. Li Rong Nun also said that Li Baoshu did not rape the plaintiff and that she was a young woman who was studying and knew about propriety and was an intellectual person and would not do such a thing. She asked for a clear investigation. Judge Wu announced the end of the arguments and scheduled the verdict for the afternoon of December 6.</p>

<h3>兩江中國之團體表演</h3>
<p>Two Jiangs and China's Group Performance</p>
<p>— 妍千</p>
<p>— Yan Qian</p>
<p>The China Sports School and the Two Jiangs Women's Sports School held a joint sports meet at the China Football Field yesterday to commemorate their 24th anniversary and 10th anniversary, respectively. There were eighteen group performance programs. The education news column of this newspaper has already published it. Now, I will record the details that are not detailed in the news and some trivial and interesting things to make this talk true, so that those who have not been able to visit can also get a general idea here. If you read it together with the education news, you may feel as if you are there.</p>
<p>The students of the Two Jiangs wore white hats, white clothes, black pants, and white shoes and socks. The socks were long and reached halfway up the thighs, so white was more than black on the whole body. The words "Two Jiangs" were obliquely attached to the chest in bright red. The colors of the whole body were harmonious, combined with the inherent health and beauty of each student, which made them look even more beautiful. At the opening ceremony, the students of the two schools walked around the entire venue, led by the band jointly compiled by the two schools. Some viewers said that they had never seen female students drumming and flute playing before, and the particularly fat drum player was especially noticeable to the audience. During the parade, the Two Jiangs were in front and China was behind. Therefore, some viewers said that this and Ms. Lu Lihua being the president of the association were both signs of the promotion of women's rights. It was also a good story at the time.</p>
<p>When singing the Party song and the sports meet song, the number of students from China was smaller than that of the Two Jiangs, so only the sharp singing of the Two Jiangs was heard. Therefore, it was rumored that the male students could not sing. When performing the welcome exercises, the Chinese students suddenly sang loudly. The voices were rough and loud, as if they deliberately wanted to compete with the sharpness of "one two three four, two two three four."</p>
<p>The Chinese students are mostly tall and strong, so their performances and dances have won the audience's laughter, and they have been given the nicknames "Big Boy" and "Little Girl." Here, I also see that some people still think that sports is just "children's play." Therefore, the active promotion of sports is truly an urgent task.</p>
<p>The reporters from various newspapers in this city were very diligent in taking photos at the venue. The skillful movements of the Chinese's double and multiple people were all captured in the camera. It is expected that many new and valuable works will be added to the recent one or two issues of books and newspapers.</p>
<p>The audience was full of seats all around that day. Because most of them were wearing dark clothes, they could only see black from a distance, which contrasted with the white of the Two Jiangs and made it interesting.</p>
<h3>Interesting Anecdotes from the Small Round Table Conference</h3>
<p>— Bing Xin</p>
<p>Just as India has its large round table conferences, my friend Pengcheng-jun holds small round table conferences, and these small round table conferences have many interesting anecdotes. Until now, they have not officially begun. Pengcheng-jun has kept this matter secret, but his younger brother revealed it. Because its amusement does not harm elegance, I have obtained his consent to disclose it, but I am forbidden to reveal his real name. I will write down the process to provide material for conversation.</p>
<p>The Origin of the Motion: Pengcheng, a verdant youth, found himself in a complex situation. He left traces of his affection everywhere, amidst spring flowers and autumn moons, yet he never frequented the brothels. The women he associated with were all from respectable families with appreciable charm and talent. His younger brother, also seventeen, was strictly disciplined by his elder brother. Though not daring to disobey, he could not help but feel resentful. One day, the younger brother said to his sister-in-law, "Elder brother has so many girlfriends that gathering them could fill a round table." Jealousy is a characteristic of humans, especially women. Therefore, the wife repeatedly questioned and insisted that Pengcheng explain the number and names of these women. She also said, "Although you have forbidden him from philandering, he cannot be too excessive. Please rent a restaurant to gather these beauties at one table. I will choose the two most beautiful to place in a separate room, and I will refuse the rest." Pengcheng smiled and dismissed it, unwilling to comply, knowing that the outcome would not be good.</p>
<p>The Difficulty of Summoning: For ten days, Pengcheng was urged, scolded, and entangled by his wife with soft words and angry expressions between the sheets. Unable to resist, he agreed to summon six of his acquaintances to meet at a certain Western restaurant. However, these six people usually avoided each other and did not know that there were others besides themselves. Pengcheng deceived them, claiming that they were attending a gathering of relatives and invited them to accompany him, but he dared not hide the presence of his wife. All six used this point as a reason to refuse to participate. The wife also complained that he should have stated clearly that she would be there, which made summoning them even more difficult.</p>
<p>Recent Changes: Recently, the wife made Pengcheng tell the six that she would not be present. Then, she suggested that he temporarily introduce her as a distant relative. Furthermore, because the long Western dining table made it difficult to see clearly, she changed the venue to a Sichuan restaurant with a small round table. Pengcheng could not resist and complied with each request. Five of the six agreed. However, one of them said, "Why must I participate in a gathering of relatives?" and added that the sudden change of venue and the fact that his wife, who was supposed to be present, was suddenly absent made him suspect that this was not a friendly gathering but a trap. He resolutely refused to attend. Pengcheng was greatly embarrassed by this small round table conference.</p>
<h3>A Record of Taking the Postal Worker Examination</h3>
<p>— Dai</p>
<p>The postal bureau's recruitment of postal workers attracted over a thousand applicants this time, making the difficulty of being accepted imaginable. I also took the exam, so I recorded the process and circumstances of the oral and written tests to share my experiences. I believe this will also be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>The 7th was the date for the oral exam. The method for the oral exam was to gather fifty to sixty people each day and divide them into three groups, testing their ability to read aloud and explain one Chinese and one English passage in order. The Chinese passage was selected from ancient books and was quite profound, with the difficulty of being obscure and hard to pronounce. The English passage was also similar; without at least five or six years of English study, it would be truly difficult to read and explain. Therefore, the oral exam eliminated quite a few, accepting only three or four out of ten. I was fortunate enough to pass the oral exam. I then went to take the written exam on the 23rd. I needed to arrive by 6:30 a.m., so I got up the night before and set off at 6:00 a.m. The east was just beginning to show a fish-belly color, and sitting in the car, I felt especially cold. The exam location was in the parcel room of the Postal General Bureau on North Sichuan Road. Tables and chairs were arranged haphazardly, filling the room. There were 523 applicants in total. After entering, each examinee found their number and sat in the corresponding seat. Women were placed in a separate room. This was the first time the postal bureau had recruited female postal workers, and there were also fifty or sixty applicants. After I took my seat and waited for a moment, the exam began at 7:00 a.m. The first test was on Chinese language. The essay topic was "What should be the foundation upon which to begin the period of political tutelage?" or "The prediction for Chinese commerce after the abolition of the likin tax." Examinees could choose one topic. In addition, they also had to draft an official document. The total time limit was two and a half hours. At 9:30 a.m., the test on the Three Principles of the People was held, with five questions that were also quite profound, such as the errors of the Tongmenghui and methods to achieve true equality, which were difficult to answer. The time limit was one and a half hours. From 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m., the arithmetic test was held, with eight questions that were not very difficult, but the large number of digits made the calculations time-consuming. The questions focused on fractions and interest, all in English. After the test, I left and went home for lunch. At 3:00 p.m., I went back for the English test, writing an essay. The topic was relatively simple, and examinees could choose one from three topics. The time limit was one and a half hours. At 4:00 p.m., the general knowledge test began, covering a wide range of topics, including recent events and contemporary celebrities such as Mussolini, Ford (the American automobile magnate), and Gandhi. Those who did not read newspapers regularly would be at a loss. The time limit was two and a half hours. From 7:00 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., the geography test was held, with six questions that were beyond what we usually expected, such as how long it would take to fly from Shanghai to Chengdu in Sichuan, how many miles there were in a journey around the equator, and what countries would be passed through. These questions were the most difficult to answer, and there would likely be many who submitted blank papers. I finished the test at 8:00 p.m. and hired a car to return home. The city lights were all lit up, and it was already dusk. After returning home, I had a light dinner and went to bed. In total, I took the exam for ten and a half hours in one day. Back in the days of the imperial examination, I imagine taking the exams to become a Xiucai or Juren was no different. One can imagine the mental exhaustion.</p>
<p>Short News: Lu Zongding, the ten-year-old from five years ago, has come to Shanghai again. He was praised by the French Consul-General, Bodisch, and Fukushima, the Taipan of Mitsui &amp; Co., at sea. Now, he is appreciated by Mr. Zhang Taiyan, Mr. Ma Xiangbo, and Mr. Huang Jinrong. He currently resides at No. 1 Xinsha Street, Zilai Street, French Concession, next to No. 4 Tongde Lane. (Yi)</p>
<h3>Lamenting Jie Zidi</h3>
<p>— Xie Gongzhan</p>
<p>Who killed you? Who suppressed you? Who caused you to lose your life? The creditor values wealth and abandons talent. Do not say that Bo Ren is difficult to avenge.</p>
<p>I taught you, I helped you achieve fame, I misled you and wasted your time. Thinking only of the present and forgetting the future, my tears and intestines are broken. What is the use of grieving for Changji again?</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Xie Jiezi</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>We made friends for over a decade, choosing the same profession and living next door to each other. We also roamed scenic spots together, composing poems side by side by the East Great Lake, as if it were yesterday.</p>
<p>Having been ill for less than three years, you suffered destruction, torment, and the coldness of the world. In the Baolong Hospital, one needle was all it took for you to leave and for us to compose a requiem.</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Xie Jiezi</h3>
<p>— Zhao Weifo</p>
<p>Medicine is meant to save people, but it can also kill. Alas, Xie Lingyun, why did you have to die?</p>
<p>Although you have passed away, your legacy will endure. Alas, Li Changji, I hold such views.</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Jiezi</h3>
<p>— Xu Jianping</p>
<p>The flute and panpipes play in harmony now as in ancient times. I expect that the spring grass and pond you sang of are still what Hui Lian dreams of.</p>
<p>Thinness was not a chronic illness, yet you were wrongly treated with foreign medicine. How could it be that Changji's fate was not prosperous?</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Jiezi</h3>
<p>— Wu Erfu</p>
<p>Regretting having stubbornly used Western medicine and mistakenly adopting its reputation, ice and snow entered your bosom and all became poisonous.</p>
<p>Xie Kang Le grieved and mourned his beloved younger brother, making a grave mistake. Tears mixed with blood wet the Dove Plain.</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Jiezi</h3>
<p>— Tao Renqian</p>
<p>Without a beloved younger brother, there is still a grieving elder brother. At the end of the year, the Cangjiang River echoes with new poems, but few respond in harmony.</p>
<p>You were richly talented but prematurely deceased. The world is full of demons and ghosts. The illness was not terminal; do not extend medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Eulogy for Jiezi</h3>
<p>— Li Haoran</p>
<p>You had the clear talent of Kang Le's Hui Lian, your words and poems inscribed alongside famous names. How can we bear to hear the sound of the crane and dove cease?</p>
<p>A good match was like a white lotus, as Luo Pin's paintings together identify your styles. How can we bear to see the lotus and buds separated?</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (325)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Cui Xiu Humbly Seeks Guidance from the Teacher; Heroic Women Feast with a Passionate Soldier in a Brothel</p>
<p>That morning, the sunlight was somewhat pale yellow, obscured by the mist of clouds. In the afternoon, the north wind grew stronger, and frozen clouds gathered on all sides, flickering like sparks of electricity. People gradually felt their feet grow cold and stomped them restlessly on the ground, as if musicians keeping time. Zuo Shichen hummed lines of Tang dynasty poetry, "The evening comes, the sky threatens snow, could you share a cup with me?" Tonight, we must have a small drink to ward off the cold. Ye Haoran said, "Let's go eat Cantonese hot pot. Now that we have the lines, 'The evening comes, the sky threatens snow, could you share a cup with me?' we can't help but complete the poem." Ling Zhixiang asked, "What are the first two lines?" Zuo Shichen replied, "Green ant new brew, red clay small stove." Long Ziyun clapped her hands and said, "That is extremely fitting! It's as if Cantonese hot pot existed in the Tang dynasty. Look, those Cantonese small stoves are all made of red clay, perfectly fitting the line 'red clay small stove.' As for the green ant brew, they have several kinds of green-colored wine, which should at least fit the scene." Zuo Shichen smiled, "It seems to me that there were many Cantonese people in the Tang dynasty. Since there were Cantonese people, naturally there were Cantonese stoves." Long Ziyun asked, "What's the evidence for that?" Zuo Shichen said, "Haven't you seen that in various European and American countries, the places where overseas Chinese live are all called 'Tang People Streets'? Of those so-called 'Tang People,' nine out of ten are Cantonese. Given this, Cantonese people can represent the Tang people. If the Tang dynasty didn't have Cantonese people, how could they represent it?" Ling Zhixiang said, "That's a far-fetched argument. We are planning to eat at a Cantonese restaurant, but where should we go?" Ye Haoran said, "Let's go to Xinghua Lou on Sima Road. It's close to where we are, and the place is big. I'm most afraid of those Cantonese restaurants that divide a large room into countless small compartments, and then decorate them with scenery like pavilions, rockeries, and trees. Those so-called 'elegant seats' are so cramped that people can't turn around and have no room to maneuver. Moreover, each compartment has a special name, either named after ancient beauties or famous Chinese scenic spots. Xinghua Lou is bigger and doesn't have those quirks. Let's go there." Everyone agreed, because Xinghua Lou was not far away, so everyone did not take a car. Long Ziyun even said, "People who live in Shanghai rarely have the opportunity to walk. They take a car as soon as they step out the door. In fact, walking is an excellent exercise. We just suffer from a lack of exercise. Look, Brother Ling isn't getting gradually fatter lately? It is said that people who lack exercise are prone to gain weight, and the most natural exercise is to walk more." Zuo Shichen said, "That's not necessarily true. Since I came to Shanghai, I haven't walked much, but I'm still skinny and haven't gained weight. It seems this statement isn't entirely true. There must be other reasons why a person gains weight."</p>

<h3>Fearsome Upsurge in Finance and Gold Markets</h3>
<p>New High of 98.6 Taels: Yesterday's gold market experienced an even more intense surge. Prices surged beyond 590 taels, but the situation was chaotic. There were fluctuations of more than seven taels throughout the half-day. The efforts to push higher were thwarted. Ultimately, prices remained high, causing considerable unease. Meanwhile, both official and unofficial foreign exchange rates were tight, with successive reductions in quotations. Fellow traders were eagerly covering their positions. Banks continued to supply funds, but market trading was erratic. Companies like Yuancheng Yong and Fuchang initially entered the market but later exited. Hengxing, Dadecheng, Yu Da, and others aggressively purchased gold and goods. Yuanmaoyong, Tongtaichang, Shunli, and Wanxing all sold their holdings. Major players continued to sell at lower prices, and American investors were still selling. As a result, gold prices soared. Buying interest was particularly strong, and short sellers were eager to cover their positions. The currency market was particularly vibrant, with an almost euphoric atmosphere. Prices rapidly surged to a new high of 98.6 taels. Subsequently, the market abruptly turned downwards, as investors used currency contracts to hedge their positions. Yuanxingyong and the Dalian gang continued to sell heavily, but prices fluctuated by more than one tael, making it difficult to predict the direction. The market ultimately weakened due to excessive supply from various firms, leading to a sudden drop of four taels to around 95 taels. However, volatility remained high, making it difficult to grasp the situation. Trading was suspended in the afternoon due to the Saturday market holiday.</p>
<p>Opening Prices Jumped: From the morning's opening at 91.7 taels for the current month, prices immediately jumped by 4.2 taels. Gross prices rose from around 90 taels to above 91 taels. Companies dealing in goods were the first to enter the market, while major players and silver prices were down by one-eighth. Hengxing, Fuchang, Yuancheng Yong, and others significantly increased their positions, leading to further price increases of more than four taels. Various firms covered their positions in British gold. When Shanghai HSBC and others quoted 1.69375 shillings for March deliveries, the published price was 96 taels, a reduction of 0.125. The 25th-day gold premium was increased by 0.75, then to 6.4 taels. At that time, Tongtaichang and others sold their holdings, immediately causing a reduction of 1.2 taels to 95.2 taels. After HSBC absorbed 1.68125 in British gold for March deliveries, market sentiment improved, and Hengxing and Fuyu and others aggressively bought gold. Around 10:00 AM, the price increased by 7.3 taels. Maoyong, retail investors, and others sold their holdings. Anda and Zhengjin sold 1.675 for January deliveries, causing a retreat of only 1.2 taels in just two or three minutes to 6.4 taels. Yuancheng, Xinheng, Zhifengyong, and Taikangrun all continued to increase their positions. News then emerged that the shilling rate had been reduced by 0.125 and the 25th-day gold premium increased by 0.01, further boosting the market. Fellow traders were frantically covering their positions. Mitsui and Mitsubishi offered 1.675 for March deliveries, and Korea bought 1.3 taels and 0.0375 for December deliveries. As a result, gold prices appeared poised to reach new heights, surging by 2.0 taels to reach 98.6 taels at 10:15 AM.</p>
<p>Major Players Selling Led to Downturn: After 10:30 AM, the market abruptly turned downwards as Huabi and Mitsubishi offered 1.675 for January deliveries. Zhengjin offered 8125 for April deliveries. Yuancheng Yong, Tongtaichang, Shunli, and Wanxing all started to sell their holdings, causing the market to suddenly weaken. The price retreated by 3.0 taels to 5.45 taels at 10:30 AM. Subsequently, there were fluctuations of a few cents around 6 taels. After 11:00 AM, Jinan Zhi bought gold, while Yuancheng, the Dalian gang, and Yuancheng Yong sold their holdings. However, prices also advanced and retreated by 800 to 900 cents. At 11:00 AM, the price was 6.8 taels, followed by 6 taels and then 6.9 taels. At 11:30 AM, the price was 5.5 taels. Mitsui absorbed current deliveries from Ta Lian, totaling 1.3 taels and 0.0375, then added 1 tael. By 11:45 AM, trading activity was very brisk, especially with HSBC offering US dollars for December at 37.9375 yuan, causing a shock and a drop of more than 2 taels to 4.2 taels.</p>
<p>Noon Closing Remained High: By the noon closing, the price was 95 taels, continuing the increase of 7.5 taels from the previous day. British gold for March deliveries could be settled at 1.68125. After the closing, the price retreated by around 2 taels as Yuancheng Yong, Xie Yu, Yuancheng, and Yufeng Yong began selling, leading to a decrease to between 2 and 3 taels. The premium on goods was reduced by 1.5 taels. The maximum price for the half-day was 98.6 taels, while the minimum price was 91.3 taels, a difference of 7.3 taels. The initial posted premium was 630.06 taels, due to a large premium on Japanese gold of 0.75, a reduction of 34 taels. Subsequently, the premium was increased by 0.01 to 635.4 taels, a reduction of about 44 taels. The price was recorded at 98 to 95 taels, with a premium of 602 taels for water. The goods premium was 1.6 taels in the morning and 3.5 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Speculative Activity Was Heavy: Traders bought and sold frequently, with transactions varying widely. Fuchang and Yuancheng Yong bought and sold repeatedly. Dadecheng, Hengxing, and Yu Da all made purchases, totaling about 6,000 to 7,000 taels. Firms dealing in goods also made purchases. Xinheng, Jinan, and Fuyu all made purchases. Taikangrun, Zhifengyong, and Xie Yu had varying buying and selling activity. Shunli, Tongtaichang, Wanxing, Taihengyuan, and Yuanchengchang all sold their holdings. Retail investors made occasional purchases and sales. The Dalian gang sold a total of 3,000 to 4,000 taels and bought 56 taels. Guangdong firms covered their short positions with over 1,000 taels.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Reduced Twice</h3>
<p>Internal Market Tightly Controlled...Gold Industry Aggressively Pursues Shillings: Yesterday, overseas silver markets fell again. American investors sold off long positions, and market conditions were flat. Exchange rates trended downward, while the Yokohama and Kobe markets remained stable. HSBC reduced foreign exchange rates twice, totaling one increment. It was reported that certain settlements required British gold. In the morning, rates were reduced by 0.125 for US dollars, 0.25 for Indian rupees, 7 yuan for French francs, 0.75 for Dutch guilders, 1 yuan for German marks, and 0.75 was added for Singapore dollars, and 0.05 was added for Hong Kong dollars, resulting in an increase of 0.75 for Japanese gold. At 10:00 AM, rates were reduced again by 0.125, with the current quotation at 1 shilling and 6.0625 pence, 0.25 for US dollars at 37.625 yuan, 0.75 for Indian rupees at 104.5 rupees, 6 yuan for French francs at 959 yuan, 0.5 yuan for Dutch guilders at 93.5 guilders, 1 tael was added for Singapore dollars at 149 taels, 1 yuan was reduced for German marks at 158 marks, and Japanese gold was increased by 0.01 to 1.3175 taels. The Hong Kong dollar rate remained unchanged at 81 taels. The internal market also trended higher, starting firm in the morning and strengthening further at noon, as gold prices declined due to pressure. As a result, the rates also leveled off, with British gold reduced by 0.25, US dollars reduced by 0.375, and Japanese gold increased by 0.0175 compared to the previous morning's closing. The gold market continued its aggressive trend, with frequent price increases. A new market price for the current month was reached, totaling 598.6 taels. However, major players sold to offset their short positions. In the end, the price was only reduced to 93.0 taels, making it difficult to predict the outcome, but ultimately the price still increased by 5.0 to 6.0 taels. Chinese gold firms aggressively pursued British gold to cover return notes, with about 400,000 pounds being traded. Banks continued to sell actively, including those from Taiwan, Shanghai, MacKay, Zhengjin, Anda, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Dongya, and Huabi. HSBC initially sold slightly but then increased its buying interest significantly. About 200,000 US dollars were traded. HSBC sold some holdings, while those settling Eastern currencies remained on the sidelines. Only the Dalian gang sold some holdings to Mitsui and Korea. The Dalian note market was exceptionally strong. Trading was suspended in the afternoon due to the Saturday market holiday.</p>

<p>According to yesterday's London cable, current silver deliveries were again reduced by 0.125 to 16.4375 pence (equivalent to 1 shilling and 7.4375 pence for British gold), and forward deliveries were also reduced by 0.125 to 16.3125 pence.

<h3>Call Loan Market Remains Slack and Weak</h3>

<h3>Securities and Bond Markets Are Robust with Continued Price Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bond market was very active, with significant trading in futures such as the 19th customs revenue and troop reduction bond at 96.6%, but spot transactions were still sporadic. The trend of bond prices was positive due to improved circumstances following the government's debt restructuring, so prices rose sharply in both morning sessions. Subsequently, the market saw some profit-taking, with slight declines in bonds such as the 19th troop reduction and troop reorganization, but the demand for the fully reorganized sixth bond remained strong, and the upward trend continued. As a result, futures for the fully reorganized sixth bond rose by more than 2 yuan compared to the settlement price, the troop reduction first-month futures rose by 1.1 yuan, and the troop reorganization futures rose by 700 to 800 cents. Spot prices for the 19th customs revenue and troop reorganization bonds also rose significantly. However, the futures prices for the 19th customs revenue and 19-year bonds declined slightly. The total value of futures transactions for the day was over 1.56 million yuan, and the total value of spot transactions was 13,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Markets Plunge</h3>
<p>The future situation is not optimistic. The cotton market has already been precarious, and now the overall situation has worsened. Both domestic and foreign raw cotton prices are declining, and sellers are pressing sales, leading to a sharp decline in prices. Recently, the yarn market has been declining with each fluctuation, presenting a new situation. Some say that the December delivery price will reach 140 taels, which may be a bold statement, but the state of panic among investors is evident. The cause of this phenomenon is partly due to overconsumption, but also due to the low prices of domestic and foreign agricultural products and the presence of many old contracts, which is a major cause of the market decline. Therefore, the trend in the future seems to be easier to decline than to rise.</p>
<p>Manchurian Cotton Prices Plunged: The Manchurian cotton prices were expected to stabilize slightly compared to the previous day, but the opening price declined immediately due to poor American cotton prices and investors' tendency to liquidate long positions. Subsequently, the price gradually declined due to a lack of new buyers, and it never recovered until the closing. The overall market decline was more than one tael, with a total of 22,850 bales traded. The closing prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Manchurian Cotton Closing Prices:</p>
<p>Balance on Account February 14,555 declined 1,432.950</p>
<p>December 14,29 declined 1,728.650</p>
<p>March 14,661 declined 1,422.950</p>
<p>January 14,411 declined 1,640.400</p>
<p>April 14,781 declined 1,129.950</p>
<p>Spot Opening Flat</p>
<p>Trading Volume Low</p>
<p>Unfavorable Market Conditions</p>
<p>The total purchases by various groups were estimated at 1,020 bales. The market declined by 250 to 500 cents. Among the guest groups, Sichuan purchased 530 bales, Yunnan purchased 108 bales, and miscellaneous groups purchased a total of 382 bales.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Actively Declining</h3>
<p>The cotton market is almost like the setting sun; the overseas situation has given the bulls a deeply unfavorable feeling, and the factories in the country all have huge amounts of imported cotton, so the demand for Chinese cotton will only increase if the price falls. Yesterday, the manufacturers of Machine Flower for settlement even indicated that they would not take delivery, which made people even more uneasy. Therefore, the bulls reluctantly cut their losses, and the bears took advantage of the situation, causing the market to plummet.</p>
<p>Han Standard Plummets: Han Standard opened lower due to the downward trend of American cotton, and the market sentiment was active with sellers. The decline continued due to disappointing actual sales and the bulls actively liquidating their positions, resulting in greater weakness. The front and back markets fell by 340 cash. The total volume traded was 64,300 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>
<p>Han Standard Closing Price Fluctuation: Account Balance, February 3150, down 45; 139000, December 3175, down 30; 99500, March 3160, down 45; 137500, January 3150, down 35; 138700, April 3185, down 45; 506000. Current demand is scarce. Demand from cotton mills and trading among peers remains sluggish. Although the supply is small, the situation is unusually stagnant. 450 bales of Yao flower and 270 bales of Tong flower arrived at the dock. Transactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Sanyou Hangzhou Factory purchased 100 pieces of Shaanxi flower at a price of 35.00, delivered to the railway station. A peer purchased 200 bales of Xiasha flower at a price of 32.00, delivered ex-warehouse.</p>
<h3>Foreign Telegrams on Falling Flower and Rebounding Yarn</h3>
<p>American Cotton Weak: Yesterday, American cotton was weak due to the decline of Wall Street and other factors, and the number of sellers hedging in the South decreased. The market was weak. Futures fell by 14 to 18 points, and spot fell by 15 points. British cotton futures fell by 6 points, and spot rose by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 5 points. Indian cotton was weak due to unfavorable opening prices in Liverpool. The near and far term of Pingguole fell by 3 rupees, Aomula fell by 1 rupee, and the far term fell by 2 rupees. Bairoxi fell by 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 28th):</p>

<h3>American Cotton Yielding to Adverse Conditions</h3>
<p>New York, 28th, report on raw cotton for the week: The focus of the cotton market last week seemed to be concentrated on the December position and its delivery situation. Delivery has only reached 16,000 bales so far. There were some bulls rolling over their positions, but it is definitely known that this cotton industry has been manipulated by two major and powerful firms, one of which is operated by a cooperative. A small number of bulls liquidating and hedging were absorbed by the buying of these firms, but the demand is still limited. More banks in the South are running aground, but some have also resumed operations. This kind of dispute has created local problems, but its impact on the current futures market is minimal, as the public recognizes that the position of ordinary banks is very stable. Attached is the weekend statistics as follows (unit: thousand bales):</p>
<p>1929 1930 Cumulative Market Count This Season 9658 8705 Cumulative Mill Consumption from August 1 3326 1887 Cumulative Exports 3201 2113 To Japan 449 348 To China 71 151 To England 623 556 To Germany 912 917</p>

<h3>Food and Rice Market's Downward Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>Zhabei: Yesterday, the source of goods from various groups was about 450, and sales were even more sluggish. The buying interest in the special grade of northern japonica rice opened at 14.5 yuan, but the buying interest was very weak, and the price was short by 2 jiao. The price of medium grade japonica rice had to be reduced by as much as 3 or 4 jiao. The price of thin indica rice fell by about 3 jiao. Sales of Yangxian rice were relatively active on this street, but the general trend was to follow the price cut by 1 jiao and a half. Sales of Dujian rice were evenly matched, but the stocks were thick and fell by about 1 jiao. It opened at 12.8 yuan, and the out-of-town Dujian rice remained flat. Retail sales were still considered good, and the market was generally stable. The market was sluggish and the situation was not good. The price of Liupan continued to be slightly lower, and the prices of the Yin yuan from Xu Ding also turned sluggish and the prices fell by nearly 1 jiao. The rice market on the whole day was uniformly soft. The official announcement is requested and if the evening group ships out for a few days, the price of rice may have to be sold off.</p>
<p>South Shanghai: Yesterday, about 30 ships were seen arriving from the river. Sales on this street were in a slump. The market for northern japonica rice turned sharply downward, and the prices of high-quality rice fell by 1 jiao, while the price of Sutong white japonica rice had to be reduced by a small amount. The situation for japonica rice here was really due to a lack of inquiries. Most of the small number of customers arbitrarily discounted the prices, and the market fell as a result. The market for thin early indica rice from the southern group rebounded sharply, so transactions of medium-quality rice were sparse. Although some out-of-town groups took delivery of the top-quality high-priced goods, the price had to be reduced by 1 or 2 jiao. The general trend was still softening. This market was the worst. Not many Dujian rice arrived, sales were acceptable, and the price remained at the original level. The price of Tongbian Yin was fluctuating. The goods coming from the inner roads were slightly scarce, and the owners showed signs of hoarding.</p>
<h3>Outlook for Out-of-Town Indica Rice is Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of out-of-town indica rice were still good on this street. Although the arrival of goods was endless and the sales of out-of-town goods were stagnant, the market was stable with local sales. Furthermore, the arrival and sales of foreign rice were both lacking, and the donations and transportation of out-of-town indica rice were also blocked by taxes, so if there were no unexpected changes in the market within the year, it should be stable. Yesterday, the total market transaction was 350 bags of early season Jiangxi machine rice at a price of 10 yuan and 0.25 jiao to 0.2 jiao, and 300 bags of late season machine rice at a price of 11 yuan and 4 jiao to 1.5 jiao. 300 bags of Nanjing machine rice were priced at 10 yuan, 0.17 to 0.09 jiao. The source of Hunan rice is gradually becoming active. Although there are no large shipments arriving, small shipments are arriving daily. If the tax is reduced again in the future, more goods can be expected to arrive. Yesterday, 100 bags of Hunan machine oil were offered at a price of 10 yuan and 0.097 jiao, and more than 100 bags of machine Jinggang were offered at a price of 11 yuan and 3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Only 3,000 Bags of Flour Delivered This Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for November flour futures. The total delivery volume for the day was only 3,000 bags, including 2,000 bags of Fufeng's Red and Blue Car and 1,000 bags of China's Green Three Stars. Although the environment was not good, the factories' stocks were generally empty, so the delivery date was as sparse as the morning stars. It is heard that starting from December, Fufeng's Red and Blue Car will be sold at any time due to the small size of the standard. It is heard that it will not be sold to out-of-town groups.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Wheat Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of wheat futures in the morning and afternoon, the market for each month fell sharply again. Because the price of foreign wheat was still 123 jiao lower, the market sentiment was naturally depressed. In addition, local merchants in this port felt that the standard of foreign wheat spot was still low and cheap, so many speculators placed orders for foreign wheat and hedged on the exchange. This kind of cyclical ordering of foreign wheat is in fact not for the purpose of supplementing the deficiency of local wheat, but is clearly a hedging operation, merely providing speculative products for the market. Therefore, the position of the bulls was under great pressure and they had to sell at any time to liquidate. However, the future is so weak that it seems even worse. As a result, the current month and January both fell by as much as 7 fen, February and March fell by 5 fen, and April fell by 4 fen.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Japanese Sugar and Hedged Market Both Called Higher</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Trading Turns Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the telegram from the sugar market production area stated that the current price of Cuban sugar was still 1.40625. The price of New York sugar futures for September was 1.35, which was 6 fen higher than the previous telegram. The price for March next year was 1.475, May was 1.55, and September was 1.68, each up 5 fen. The rise and fall of Javanese sugar futures and spot was still lacking. The association's market marked the price of 24 coarse sand white at 7 taels and 4 qian and a half, as the Dutch sugar continued to shrink and the market stabilized. Buyers were slightly active, and the transaction price was still 7 taels and 4 qian and a half. The entry and exit were still active, but there were not many sellers, and the market was quite strong. Finely ground sand white was 7 taels and 5 qian and a half, and 18 medium sand white was 6 taels and 6 qian and a half. The market was also free. The Japanese sugar market also called for higher prices. Minghua YRO mark was 7 taels, YT mark was 7 taels and 5 qian and 2.5 fen, and YP mark was 7 taels and 8 qian and a half. There were slight transactions, and the market was quite popular. N mark was called for 7 taels and 7 qian, and the mark was 8 taels and 5 fen. Although there was no hand received, the market seemed to have turned beautiful.</p>
<h3>Silk, Tea, Yellow Silk Reeling, Printing and Sales Also Clear</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of foreign silk in this port were still sluggish. The American and French markets for Japanese and Italian raw silk still had a market but no sales, and the factories' sales were stagnant. The yellow silk reeling, English and Indian sales were also clear. Yesterday, only Xiangji and other companies purchased 12 bales of yellow reeled silk and 15 bales of high-quality yellow coarse silk. The prices were generally weak.</p>
<h3>Silk Cocoons and Silkworm Excrement Continue to Flow</h3>
<p>Although the sales of silk cocoons and silkworm excrement to France and Japan this year are difficult to be smooth, the purchase interest of domestic silk factories is not weak. The stock in Shanghai port is scarce. The 560 dan of silk cocoons, etc., shipped from various ports at the end of last month have already been sold out, and the source has not weakened. Recently, 380 dan of silk cocoons and silkworm excrement have been shipped from Guangdong, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Wuxi, and other places. Various brokers are preparing to deliver them by the end of this month, and the futures market is becoming more and more firm.</p>
<h3>Over 40,000 Boxes of Zhenmei Tea in Shanghai Stock</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market was extremely quiet. Only the Russian firm in the city purchased hundreds of boxes of Gongxi green tea at a price of 37 to 54 taels. In addition, Tongfu and Jinjiang and other companies slightly increased their purchase of Zhenmei Pearl Tea, but they were all for the purpose of replenishing vacancies. It is found that there are still more than 40,000 boxes of Zhenmei in stock, and it is feared that it will be difficult to sell them all this year.</p>

<h3>Oscar Wilde's Unwritten Masterpiece</h3>
<p>— Wang Tiran</p>
<p>To Mr. and Mrs. Tawney Wroote</p>
<p>The 30th of this month marks the 30th anniversary of Oscar Wilde's death. This article is intended as a small commemoration.</p>
<p>Those who have read Oscar Wilde's plays are likely to become addicted, finding it difficult to find such wit and cleverness elsewhere. However, although Oscar Wilde's plays are not few in number, there are only seven. These seven seem insufficient to satisfy. Originally, he should have had a total of eight plays, but the last one, although Oscar Wilde had sold the copyright to a publisher and an actor at different times, he never wrote it. Therefore, this work can at best be considered half a play.</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde had already conceived this half-play, but he was simply slow to write it. Therefore, his friends knew that he had such a play. When Oscar Wilde was short of money, he would pawn this unborn child to others to get some money to use. Three or four months before his death, the name of this play had already become very well-known. Many people in the literary circles of Paris and London knew about it, but Oscar Wilde was poor and lazy, and refused to write the play. At that time, he was living in Paris in dire straits. Coincidentally, his old friend Frank Harris also arrived in Paris, engaged in commercial affairs and was a wealthy friend. Oscar Wilde went to visit him, needless to say, to try to find some money to use. Unfortunately, Harris had just invested unsuccessfully and was in very difficult financial straits, not having enough money even for himself. Therefore, he was unable to meet Oscar Wilde's demands. But Oscar Wilde kept pressing him for money, so he advised Oscar Wilde to write the play. Wouldn't he have money once the play was performed? But what Oscar Wilde wanted at that time was money, not advice. So he replied, "No, Frank, I will never write that play again. You take it and write it yourself. I give you the play." These words were naturally very generous, but the purpose was still to hope that the other party would also be generous. But Harris was not generous at that time. He answered in a businesslike manner (Harris was a literary figure who did everything). He proposed to co-write this play with Oscar Wilde. The method was to share the profits equally. Oscar Wilde would write the first act, Harris would write the second act, the third and the last, fourth act would be a collaboration between the two. Oscar Wilde agreed, but this agreement was of course not willing to share his final masterpiece with others, but to use this to get along with Harris and let Harris be the host, so that he could live a wealthy and leisurely life. But he miscalculated. Harris had a lot of things to do and could not stay in Paris for a long time. He was about to return to the United States. This situation naturally disappointed Oscar Wilde very much, but later they finally agreed that Harris would return to England, write the second and third acts, and send them to Oscar Wilde to read. Oscar Wilde would revise them and then write the first act, and then the two would collaborate on the fourth act. Harris was very enthusiastic, probably believing that this was a matter of fame and fortune. He soon wrote the second and third acts and sent them to Paris for Oscar Wilde to review. But Oscar Wilde was not enthusiastic at all. He angrily sent back a letter saying that the second act was too long and that there should not be another climax after the climax. The third act was also no good, the protagonist's monologue was too long, and using monologues was an outdated playwriting technique. His criticism was correct, but his attitude was too cold. He didn't write a single word. The first act that he should have written was of course not started. So Frank Harris got angry and thought, "Does Oscar Wilde not want to write, so I won't write?" He finished the play. At this time, the two friends had almost fallen out. Oscar Wilde scolded Harris for stealing his work. Harris of course did not admit it. But at the heart of the matter, the (治文屈列先生及夫人) Mr. and Mrs. Day Entry compiled by Harris, although the second and fourth acts were different from Oscar Wilde's original intention, the structure and plot of the entire play were based on Oscar Wilde's outline. Therefore, we can at most regard it as Oscar Wilde's play written by Harris. This is naturally different from Oscar Wilde's own work. Moreover, this play became a vulgar thing in Harris's hands and was very different from what Oscar Wilde originally wanted to write. According to Harris's secretary, T. H. Bell, in the American (讀書人) magazine, Oscar Wilde's original structure was not only far superior to Harris's adaptation, but if it were written, it could simply be regarded as Oscar Wilde's best play of his life. Therefore, it is a pity that he did not write this play until his death.</p>
<p>Now, leaving aside Harris's adaptation, let's talk about Oscar Wilde's (台文屈列先生及夫人) Mr. and Mrs. Tawney Wroote, which he often talked about but never wrote. However, what we are talking about here is of course only the outline of the entire play as talked about by Oscar Wilde, and not a summary of the original text. Therefore, it is inevitable that it lacks brilliance.</p>
<p>The first act is a social scene in the home of Mr. and Mrs. Tawney Wroote. The women are chatting with endless wit and clever remarks. Although this act is used to introduce the characters in the play, it is inevitable that Oscar Wilde's writing will shine with his unique talent for speaking and create many wonderful witty remarks. Mrs. Tawney Wroote is young, intelligent, well-educated, and full of ideals. Mr. Tawney Wroote is older than her, physically strong, and an athlete. He has a clear mind, but with a bit of a cynical attitude. He enjoys life very much and is very proud of having such a beautiful wife, but he also pays attention to other beautiful women. In addition, there is Mr. Lansfield, a younger man, thin, tall, quiet, humble, and not strong in character. He is an old friend of Mrs. Tawney Wroote. At the end of this act is a conversation between Mr. Tawney Wroote and Lansfield. Mr. Tawney Wroote mentions that he lacks cash to turn around, and Lansfield automatically lends him a sum of money. Mr. Tawney Wroote says, "Thank you, old brother."</p>
<p>The second act takes place a little later than the first act, in the evening, in the study of Mr. Tawney Wroote's house. Mrs. Tawney Wroote walks into the study, physically tired and mentally depressed. She first sits down and then lies on a couch, dimming the lights. Mrs. Summers comes in. This Mrs. Summers is the (beautiful woman) that Mr. Tawney Wroote focused on in the first act. Mr. Tawney Wroote follows in. Because Mrs. Tawney Wroote is in a dimly lit place and is partially covered by a screen, they do not see her. Mrs. Summers is in financial difficulties, but does not dare to let her husband, Sir George, know. Mr. Tawney Wroote tells her that he has money to lend her. Mrs. Summers is relieved and lets him do some lovemaking, eagerly accepting his money. But she immediately becomes anxious and eager to get out to avoid being seen by others. But Mr. Tawney Wroote is just proud and continues his work of expressing love. Just then, there is a knock on the door. Mr. Tawney Wroote had locked the door in advance as a precaution. Mrs. Summers became anxious and said, "This is my husband, my husband wants to come in, what should I do?" She wants to find a way to escape, but there is no way to escape. The knock on the door rings again, this time louder and with a commanding tone. There is no way out. They are caught. Sir George's voice outside is stern and firm, saying, "Open the door! I know my woman is inside. If you don't open the door, I will break the door and come in!"</p>
<p>At this (critical moment), the pair are shocked when Mrs. Tawney Wroote suddenly stands up, walks to the door, opens the door, and says, "Oh, of course, Sir George, if you want to come in, please come in." Sir George is naturally very surprised to see her. He almost doesn't believe his eyes and ears. He came with a bellyful of anger, determined to catch his woman, but who knew that a Cheng Yaojin suddenly jumped out halfway. He had no choice but to apologize embarrassedly and leave with his wife. This is the second act.</p>
<p>In the opening of the third act, we see Lansfield alone in his room, monologuing. He has always loved Mrs. Tawney Wroote, but he is younger than her. Compared to Mr. Tawney Wroote, he can only be considered a child, not as strong as Mr. Tawney Wroote, who does whatever he wants. Therefore, Mrs. Tawney was finally taken by him, but now she has left Mr. Tawney Wroote and is unwilling to be his wife again. Therefore, the cowardly Lansfield is in pain and panic. Finally, he decides to leave for a foreign country immediately to stay out of the situation.</p>
<p>Mr. Tawney Wroote comes in. They have always been good friends, so this meeting does not turn ugly. However, Lansfield feels a little embarrassed. Mr. Tawney Wroote admits that his behavior was wrong. He cannot blame his wife for leaving him. He does not know where his wife is, but he wants to communicate with her to persuade her to go home and promises that he will be well-behaved from now on. Lansfield does not quite believe him when he hears this. He hesitates. So Mr. Tawney Wroote argues with him, saying, "If she comes back, you know she is not subject to any restrictions. She is just giving me a chance to reform myself." Lansfield is obviously not very convinced by his words, but in the end, Mr. Tawney Wroote is victorious. Lansfield agrees to pass on this message for him. So they shake hands and part.</p>
<p>As soon as he leaves, Mrs. Tawney Wroote comes in and talks to Lansfield. Lansfield says awkwardly but truthfully about Mr. Tawney Wroote's proposal. Mrs. Tawney Wroote is very angry. No, she will definitely not go back. She has made this decision after careful consideration. She will never continue to ruin her life meaninglessly. This is not the first time this has happened. Stop talking about this, John. What about yourself? What are you planning? What are these many suitcases for? Where are you taking these suitcases?" John replies hesitantly that he is going to Africa. "Going to Africa? Why Africa?" John then becomes very flustered and hesitantly tries to explain, but she rejects his explanation. "John, tell me the truth, are you going to Africa to avoid me?" So John has no choice but to submit. The third act ends.</p>
<p>Fourth Act: The couple lives in seclusion in a remote part of the European continent to avoid attention. Previously, Mr. Tawney Wroote did not know their whereabouts, but Lansfield heard that he has now discovered their address and is pursuing them, and it is said that he has sworn to put Lansfield to death. He said that their affair was arranged when he met Lansfield, so Lansfield is a person who deceives and betrays friends... This is very bad news, but when Mrs. Tawney Wroote proposes that they flee elsewhere together, Lansfield resolutely refuses. He believes that this is a sign of cowardice, so he must wait. At the same time, there is another reason, which is that their child is about to be born and she cannot endure the hardship of traveling. After such persuasion, he goes out for a walk alone.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Mr. Tawney Wroote appears. She is surprised, but she boldly confronts him. He finally changes his violent attitude and uses gentle words to persuade her to give him another chance to rehabilitate himself, to persuade her to go back with him. But she resolutely refuses. She will never go back. She demands to be with the person she loves forever. At this point, Mr. Tawney Wroote cannot bear it and loses his temper again, saying that if he meets Lansfield, he will shoot him to death like a dog. As he speaks, he angrily leaves. As soon as he leaves, Mrs. Tawney Wroote puts on her coat and wants to find her lover to tell him to escape quickly. But she doesn't know where he is. She can't walk much herself. She has no way to think and has no choice but to fall on the couch, trembling in fear.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gunshot rings out.</p>
<p>She exclaims and jumps up, madly complaining that she shouldn't have gone out to warn her lover, causing him to suffer a terrible death. At this moment, a female servant runs across the corridor, exclaiming. Mrs. Tawney Wroote grabs her and asks her, "What is this? What did you see? Who? Tell me, tell me, tell me what you saw?" The female servant tells her that "the new English gentleman in room eight shot another gentleman to death." She is dizzy when she hears these words, but at this moment, Lansfield walks in very calmly and hugs her. "Ah, John, John, is it really you? I heard a gunshot. There really was a gunshot, wasn't there? But John, who did you shoot to death? Could it be..."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was Mr. Tawney Wroote."</p>
<p>"What? Did he commit suicide?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Ah, John, John, did you shoot him to death?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Then who fired that shot?"</p>
<p>"Sir George."</p>
