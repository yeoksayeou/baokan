<p>今年因世界年歲大熟之故又有金貴銀賤劇烈變動之故各國商業致生變化他國且勿論祇以中日兩國而言日本之米與絲竟有運來上海以求銷者日本又由上海與滿州輸入棉紗者此皆從來所未有之事今乃有此反常之舉甚可異也</p>
<p>雖然是雖可異而實不足異者何也世界之物價即有貴賤亦必由漸而來故無一時劇烈之變化惟用金用銀之國旣不一致則物價由金銀而異者金銀之漲落劇變則物價亦因之而劇變物價劇變則反常之商業即因之而生故金貴銀賤之趨勢苟日進無已者不特中日間米絲與棉紗之商業反常其他商業亦未必不反常不特中日之商業反常其他用金用銀不同之國亦未必不反常世事之變化誠非智識淺薄之人類所能逆料然其間因種種事物之凑合自由一定不易之途徑初非若干人之力量於一時之間所能挽回也</p>

<h3>付之一笑</h3>
<p>— 海客</p>
<p>甲童—你的父親爲了身體發胖不是在天天運動麽</p>
<p>乙童—是的他每天一起身就要運動一番</p>
<p>甲童—那麽他的身體减瘦了些没有</p>
<p>乙童—瘦得多了你記得他的胸口不是剌著一艘藍色的大輪船的麽現在變成一艘小舢板了</p>
<p>老紳士（上書店買一本小説向店夥説）—我知道這小説銷塲好大受讀者的歡迎但是書中的描寫和情節可有甚麽齷齪之處</p>
<p>店夥—一些没有</p>
<p>老紳士—我有些不放心你可能擔保它是乾乾净净的麽</p>
<p>店夥（帶笑作答）—再乾净没有了那書中的主人翁是開浴堂的他的父親是染坊中的漂白司務他的母親是專給人家洗衣服的像這樣一門乾净再嫌不夠麽</p>
<p>甲（遠游回來將他游歷的經過很誇在的對朋友們説）—我這一回的游歷比了西方的大探險家眞不相上下我曾登過極商極危險的山嶺我曾涉過極深極端急的河流我曾到過極大極荒凉的森林中去有許多奇怪的大鳥飛下來啄我也不知是甚麽鳥—</p>
<p>乙—我知道這是啄木鳥</p>
<h3>萬頭攅動看梅花</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>平角來滬奏藝於登臺之先必有宴客之舉此風創自梅畹華流傳至今已成龍一尋常慣例畹華此來當然未能免俗於三日之晚四馬路全家福設宴欵待報票兩界歡叙余以俗塵所累七時一刻始去至則客已滿堂座無隙地矣茲將筵前花絮摘記於下</p>
<p>請柬由梅王（鳳卿）譚（富英）姜（妙香）四人聯具而所到主人則有五其一即名丑蕭長華係畹華臨時請其加入蓋取梅花五瓣之意也</p>
<p>姚玉芙不加入主人團專任招待之職站立路口含笑相迎如遇熱友必上前握手爲禮遞烟敬茶狀至殷勤畹華之能享此大名玉芙相助之力爲多也</p>
<p>是日所到之客先後不下四五百人票界佔多數報界僅十分之二三久不赴宴之林屋山人與客居首都之海上漱石生都相繼蒞止足龍梅筵生色不少惟快活之鹤與自由之鵑始終未見光臨未免爲主人及一般來賓所惦念蓋二君已成爲宴會場中之中心人物可以無他客不可無此二君也</p>
<p>畹華致詞向由劉豁公君代表是日豁公未至致畹華之致詞問題發生一絶大之恐慌空我恥痕半狂逸芬轉陶諸君推愚代畹華出馬愚曰胸中一無成竹客又如此衆多不但吃螺絲簡直非栽筋斗不可再三哀求始獲倖免然而已揑一把冷汗矣</p>
<p>席將散畹華乃不得不自行發方畹華之辭可分四層第一層謂自美回來後以母喪亟亟返平致未能與諸君相把晤第二層謂赴美獻藝尚得該邦人士之歡迎惟於藝術上並無絲毫之增進有其名而無其實至深慚愧第三層謂此來將多演舊劇供獻於好曲諸君改良戲劇之責應由新劇界諸前輩共同擔負末層始轉到請客本題層次井然言語流利演説之能手也</p>
<p>席散後余與富英鳳卿長華同下樓見門外路人　集如山如海詢之茶役謂彼輩俱爲看梅老板而來俟畹華去後始各欣然而散</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Abnormal Commerce Between China and Japan</h3>
<p>This year, due to the global bumper harvest and the drastic changes in the price of gold and silver, changes have occurred in the commerce of various countries. Let us only talk about China and Japan. Rice and silk from Japan are being shipped to Shanghai for sale, and Japan is importing cotton yarn from Shanghai and Manchuria. These are all unprecedented events, and this abnormal behavior is quite strange.</p>
<p>Although it is strange, it is not actually that strange. The prices of goods in the world, even if they are high or low, must come gradually, so there is no drastic change in a moment. However, since the countries using gold and silver are inconsistent, the prices of goods differ due to gold and silver. When the rise and fall of gold and silver change drastically, the prices of goods also change drastically accordingly. When the prices of goods change drastically, abnormal commerce arises accordingly. Therefore, if the trend of gold being expensive and silver being cheap continues to increase daily, not only will the commerce of rice, silk, and cotton yarn between China and Japan be abnormal, but other commerce may also become abnormal. Not only will the commerce between China and Japan be abnormal, but other countries that use gold and silver differently may also become abnormal. Changes in world affairs cannot be predicted by people with shallow knowledge. However, the combination of various things has its own inevitable path and cannot be reversed by the power of a few people in a short period of time.</p>

<h3>German Parliament Discusses Fiscal Policy</h3>
<p>Brüning Cabinet Repeatedly Wins</p>
<p>National News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The German Parliament has been discussing the government's fiscal policy for four days now. The meeting opened very early this morning. As a result of the debate, the Brüning cabinet repeatedly won victories because the Social Democratic Party, taking the overall situation into account, almost unanimously attended and supported the government. The motion to revoke the emergency decree was defeated by 293 votes to 253. The National Socialist Party's motion to vote on a vote of confidence in the government was also decided to be unnecessary to discuss by 298 votes to 233. The motion of no confidence in the government proposed by the National Socialist Party, the Communist Party, the National People's Party, and the Economic Party for no less than ten times was also rejected by a combined vote of 291 votes to 256. Finally, the Communist Party's motion to revoke the July emergency decree was also dismissed by 307 votes to 225. When discussing the motion of no confidence, the atmosphere in the parliament was very chaotic. When a National People's Party member rose to discuss the political situation and denounced the Social Democratic Party, there was thunderous applause from the right-wing and Communist seats. There was also an occasion when members of the National Sovereignty Party, the National Socialist Party, and the Party rushed to the Social Democratic Party seats, threatening violence. Fortunately, the Speaker took effective measures to restore order and was able to close the meeting. Reuters, Berlin, 6th: The motion proposed by the National Sovereignty Party and the Communist Party to dismiss the implementation of the government's fiscal plan was rejected in the parliament today by 293 votes to 253. The National Socialist Party proposed a vote of confidence in the government. The parliament decided by 298 votes to 233 that this case was inappropriate. A Central Party member said that this case was purely comical because the National Socialist Party, although proposing an anti-government case, actually wanted to cast a vote of no confidence in the government. The German National People's Party and the Communist Party then proposed a motion of no confidence in the government, which the parliament rejected by 291 votes to 256. Only then could the Brüning cabinet implement its important bills and fiscal reform plan. It is rumored that the opposition party feels relieved about today's vote because, except for the National Socialist Party, they are unwilling to take on the heavy responsibility of the government at this time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Closely Contacts with the Party</h3>
<p>The Method of Contact Adopts a Collegial System</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: A meeting of the government and party executives is scheduled to be held at the Imperial Hotel at 5 p.m. on the 10th. That night, the meeting will (1) decide on government and party liaison, (2) select new personnel for the Constitutional Party, and (3) decide on countermeasures for the parliament depending on the condition of Prime Minister Hamaguchi's injuries. For government and party liaison, the party's control is most important at this moment, so no one else will be appointed, and it is planned to adopt a collegial system with several people. Approximately, the government will appoint Interior Minister Adachi and Railway Minister Ekida, and the party will appoint Secretary-General Hara and Chief Secretary Tomita. Dentsu News Agency, Osaka, 7th: Railway Minister Ekida, who will attend the general meeting of the Hyogo branch of the Constitutional Party, arrived in Osaka at 5:20 p.m. yesterday. In the car, he said that liaison between the party and the government seems to be a problem. The most suitable person for this position is Interior Minister Adachi, who is most familiar with the party's internal situation and has in fact become the party's vice-president. Although there are rumors in the world that the Adachi faction and the Ekida faction are engaged in internal strife, there is absolutely no such stupid thing. If Prime Minister Hamaguchi can attend the parliament after the adjournment expires, it would be better for the cabinet members to share the burden rather than for one person to bear it alone. I think it will naturally be like this. Foreign Minister Shidehara will not resign as acting prime minister before the parliament. He already has a secret plan to overcome the difficulties. If Mr. Adachi is in charge of the liaison between the party and the government, then the party affairs and government affairs will naturally proceed smoothly, and there is no need to worry about it.</p>
<h3>Barthou Agrees to Form New French Cabinet</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 6th: After Paul-Boncour declined to form a cabinet today for health reasons, Barthou has agreed to form a new cabinet. Tardieu is willing to assist, provided that the power of the majority party in the Chamber of Deputies after the 1928 election remains undamaged and that the Republican Party must have greater concentration in the cabinet and parliament. Reuters also reports that after Barthou met with Briand, he claimed that former Foreign Minister Briand had fully agreed to form a cabinet together. Currently, there is no one who is hostile to Barthou, but difficulties may arise regarding his political program and cabinet members. If former Prime Minister Tardieu joins the new cabinet, then the difficulties will be even more unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Japanese Unemployment Numbers</h3>
<p>A Total of Over 104,000 in Three Cities</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 7th - According to the latest figures, the number of unemployed in Tokyo Prefecture, Tokyo City, Yokohama City, and Kawasaki City totals over 104,000.

<h3>US House of Representatives Considers Unemployment Relief</h3>
<p>$150 Million US Dollars for Relief Funds</p>
<p>Will Be Proposed to Congress by the Appropriations Committee</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch from the Kokumin News Agency, 6th - Today, the House Appropriations Committee will consider a plan to allocate US$150 million in relief funds for unemployment in the United States. The committee will report this case to the House on Tuesday, and it is expected to receive a majority of support. Supporters of the plan anticipate that the bill will be passed by the House within a week after being submitted, and then submitted to the Senate. The processing of this case is exceptionally rapid, indicating that all members of Congress are aware that the unemployment problem is a crucial issue requiring immediate resolution nationwide. It is estimated that there are already five million people in the United States unable to find employment. According to the American Federation of Labor, if the current rate of increase continues, it will exceed seven million by February of next year.</p>
<h3>Declaration by British Labour Party Members</h3>
<p>London Dispatch from Reuters, 6th - A declaration issued and signed by seventeen Labour Party members is said to have been drafted by former cabinet member Mosley. The son of Conservative Party leader Baldwin and the secretary of the Miners' Federation, Cook, have also signed the document. The main proposals are as follows: (1) To organize a five-member cabinet to cope with current events and implement national plans, and to establish an agency to develop new industries and revitalize existing industries. (2) To establish a Food Import Administration and a Goods Import Administration. (3) To conclude trade agreements with overseas autonomous territories. (4) To establish public agencies to build houses, emulating the wartime method of building houses for munitions workers. This declaration criticizes the Conservative Party's tariff plan, pointing out that it is a protection for those with low efficiency, but it recognizes that tariffs are more convenient than issuing licenses for the work of the Goods Import Administration. Today, Transport Minister Morrison ridiculed this declaration in a speech in Wellingborough.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs Requests Issuance of Public Bonds</h3>

<h3>Trial of the Soviet Russian Industrial Sabotage Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Moscow Dispatch from the Kokumin News Agency, 6th - During today's trial of the industrial sabotage case, the public prosecutor continued to present his views. He first detailed the actions of two French military officers in the intervention plan and their organization of espionage agencies in Russia with the defendants, attempting to lure Red Army officers into traps. He then analyzed the evidence regarding the participation of former French Premier Poincaré and Sir Henry of England in the armed intervention, stating that the industrial sabotage party deliberately obstructed Soviet mobilization plans while simultaneously formulating concrete plans to create a basis for foreign invasion on the western border of Russia. After the public prosecutor's presentation, the defendants' lawyers rose to defend, requesting leniency and offering opportunities for repentance and atonement. However, only two of the eight defendants retained lawyers. Afterward, the declaration of closing arguments was concluded, and the verdict is expected to be announced on the evening of the 7th.</p>

<h3>Cause of Mysterious Poisonous Fog in Belgium Still Difficult to Determine</h3>
<p>Brussels Dispatch from the Kokumin News Agency, 6th - Despite meticulous research by experts, the cause of the poisonous air in the Meuse River valley in Belgium, which has resulted in multiple deaths, has not yet been resolved. Currently, the number of deaths reported by newspapers, which has not been verified by the authorities, has reached 106, and many others are still suffering from shortness of breath. The fog has not yet dissipated, and residents are panicking and evacuating the city.</p>
<p>Liège Dispatch from Reuters, 6th - Doctors say the fog is the sole cause of the strange disease and is unrelated to poisonous gas. Deaths are due to heart pain or chest pain.</p>
<p>Beijing Dispatch from Reuters, 6th - The deadly fog is now gradually dissipating, but the people in the Meuse River valley are terrified, like in wartime. As soon as residents realized the fog could be deadly, they closed their doors and avoided contact with the fog outside. Patients suddenly felt throat pain and chest pain. Hundreds of people have contracted this strange disease, and sixty-six have died. There is no definitive explanation for how the fog can cause death, and residents are increasingly panicked, with each person offering their own explanation. Some say that a certain type of chemical dust in the air mixes with the temperature to form a poisonous gas. As the fog dissipated slightly, the corpses of livestock were scattered in the fields. The Health Committee met in Engis today to discuss the matter. One doctor emphatically stated that the deaths in the Seraing industrial area were due to this dense fog and not gas emitted from factories. Autopsies have not yet been performed, but the Health Committee investigating the matter stated that the deaths from the fog are limited to the Meuse River valley.</p>
<h3>New Phenomenon in the Japanese Judicial World</h3>
<p>Cases of Not Guilty Verdicts Are Increasing Daily</p>
<p>Tokyo Dispatch from the Dentsu News Agency, 7th - Recently, the number of not guilty verdicts in Japanese courts nationwide has been increasing daily. Some are complaining about the prosecution authorities. The Japanese Ministry of Justice is currently collecting records of not guilty verdicts from various foreign countries. The increase in not guilty verdicts is not solely due to the prosecutor but also because the defendants themselves are good at exonerating themselves and because the defense of lawyers has also made scientific progress. Also, judges are reluctant to convict based on intuition without solid evidence. Furthermore, under the old criminal law, sufficient evidence was required for a public trial, while under the new criminal law, sufficient suspicion is enough as a reason. Since prosecutors are also human beings, they sometimes inevitably over-excite and go beyond the scope of prosecution. Such cases have been quite numerous recently. The authorities are very concerned about damaging the authority of the judiciary and have begun to study and investigate this trend.</p>

In addition to separate telegrams, this telegram is sent to the Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, Yang Hucheng, bowing.</p>
<h3>Important News: Zhu Shaoliang Arrives in Jiangxi from Nanjing</h3>
<p>To Immediately Lead the Headquarters of the Sixth Route Army into Fujian</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - Zhu Shaoliang, Commander of the Sixth Route Army, arrived in the province on the morning of the 5th from Jiujiang on a Nanchang-Xunyang Railway special train. He was welcomed at the station by Commander Lu, Division Commander Mao, and representatives from various circles, numbering several hundred. At 1:00 PM, the train arrived at Niuxing Station. After Zhu alighted, he greeted Lu, Mao, and the welcoming party. He then crossed the river with Lu to Lu's private residence for a brief discussion on the bandit suppression plan. In the afternoon, the provincial government hosted a dinner for Zhu at the West Flower Hall. Lu, Mao, and Chief of Staff Xiao were also present. There was further discussion on the bandit suppression plan and the defense affairs of the Jiangxi-Fujian border. The dinner ended at 8:00 PM in high spirits. It is reported that Zhu's visit to Fujian from Jiangxi is to serve as the Pacification Commissioner or Bandit Suppression Commander of the Jiangxi-Fujian border. Accompanying Zhu are the staff, managers, and adjutants of the Sixth Route Army Headquarters. Those who will be under Zhu's command in the future include Zhang Zhen, Commander of the New First Division; Mao Bingwen of the Eighth Division; and Xu Kexiang of the Twenty-Fourth Division. The vanguard brigade of Mao Bingwen's Eighth Division has already moved from Chongren and Yihuang in Fuzhou towards the Fujian border. Tao Zhiyue's brigade has also advanced from the province towards Fuzhou. Zhang Zhen's division is reportedly moving from Pingzhang towards Tinghang in western Fujian to prevent Zhu and Mao from entering Fujian. However, Xu's division is currently still in Jishui, and the timing of their entry into Fujian depends on the situation of the Communist bandits. According to military sources, Zhu's stay in the province will be brief, and he will immediately lead the headquarters of the Sixth Route Army into Fujian. Division Commander Mao will also accompany him. Due to the fierce attacks by the main forces, the Communist bandits under Zhu and Mao are confirmed to have entered Fujian from southeastern Jiangxi. Therefore, Zhu's trip is crucial to the bandit suppression effort. (December 6th)</p>

<p>Communist Bandits from the Jiangxi Border Invade Fujian Province</p>

(4) The defense of Yong'an and Shaxian will be temporarily garrisoned by the vanguard of the Second Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, Zhang Ziming's troops, awaiting further orders. (December 3rd)</p>
<p>Another report states that Lin Shaoqi, a representative of Lu Xingbang's troops, came to the province from Youxi the day before yesterday and met with Chen Peikun and others, reporting that Lu Xingbang sincerely accepted the transfer order. However, due to the concentration of troops, some time was needed, and he was unable to depart as scheduled, requesting understanding. Chen replied that the brigades of Qian Yuguang, Lin Bingzhou, and Liu Shangzhi were all stationed around Minqing, Gutian, and Yongtai, waiting to take over. Therefore, he urged Lu's troops to depart immediately and not to hesitate any longer. Lin is currently in the province awaiting the receipt of the departure expenses before returning to Yanping to report back. Regarding the departure expenses, the central government remitted 150,000 yuan in military and administrative expenses for November the day before yesterday, and a portion was immediately allocated to Lu. In addition, Lu Xingbang entrusted Lin Shaoqi to make two requests to the provincial government on his behalf: (1) He should be appointed as the commander of bandit suppression in western Fujian, and Lu Xingrong should temporarily serve as the brigade commander of the Provisional Third Brigade of the Provincial Defense Army, allowing him to atone for his crimes. (2) The provincial government has set the organization of the brigade at three companies per battalion, which is insufficient. Please allow it to be changed to four companies per battalion. Chen Peikun has telegraphed Yang Shuzhuang to inquire about these requests.</p>
<p>Regarding northern Fujian, it has recently been reported that Communist bandits from the Jiangxi border have invaded the borders of Chong'an, Guangze, Ninghua, and Changting. It is also reported that the Communist bandits are divided into two groups. Zhu De's group is fleeing from Yihuang, Nanfeng, and Lichuan in Jiangxi to northern Fujian. Peng Dehuai's group is fleeing from Ningcheng, Shicheng, and Ruijin in Jiangxi to western Fujian. The provincial government has repeatedly received urgent telegrams from various counties. In addition to requesting Zhang Zhen's newly reorganized 49th Division to quickly depart from Zhangzhou and head to Longyan to block the western Fujian front, the northern Fujian front will be defended by a portion of Liu Heding's division in coordination with the brigades of Zhou Zhishen and Lu Xingbang, taking a defensive stance first. After the arrival of the divisions of Xu Kexiang and Mao Bingwen, sent by the General Headquarters, they will begin the advance and suppression. (December 4th)</p>
<h3>Chen Mingshu Returns to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - Provincial Government Chairman Chen Mingshu, Rear Admiral Chen Ce, and Principal Zhu Jiahua of the Fourth Naval Fleet returned south on the Chichibu Maru from Shanghai on the 29th of last month. They arrived in Hong Kong at noon on the 1st and stayed at the Peninsula Hotel. After visiting the Governor of Hong Kong and attending a banquet hosted by the Overseas Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Zhongshan, Chen and those who welcomed him boarded the Taishan ship at 10:00 PM to return to the province. After receiving news of Chen's return to the province by ship on the 1st, key figures from various agencies flocked to the Taishan pier this morning (2nd) to await him. These included Xu Chongqing, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs; Deng Yanhua, Director of the Department of Construction; Huang Jilu, Director of the Provincial Propaganda Department; Lin Shiqing, Commander of the Military Police; Ouyang Ju, Director of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau; Luo Wenzhuang, President of the High Court; Wang Renrong, Advisor to the Eighth Route Army Headquarters; Li Limin, Secretary-General of the Provincial Government; Liang Zhihuai, Section Chief of the Municipal Government; Zhang Huichang, Director of the Aviation Administration; and Ms. Zhu Guangzhen, Chen's wife. The Eighth Route Army Headquarters also sent a military band to the port to play music to welcome him. At 6:10 AM, the ship slowly sailed into the White Swan Pool. At 6:20 AM, Chen, wearing a Western suit and a gray velvet coat, stood on the deck with Jin Zengcheng, Director of the Department of Education, and Huang Jusu, Magistrate of Zhongshan County. The key figures welcoming him waved their hats and scarves to express their welcome. Chen nodded in response. At 6:25 AM, the ship docked. The key figures welcoming him boarded the ship together and went to the Western restaurant to shake hands with Chen one by one. After a short rest, they disembarked together. At that time, the soldiers and police stood at attention to pay their respects. The military band played loudly. Chen then boarded the car in the music and headed towards Dongshan. The key figures followed closely behind, creating a scene with many cars. It was learned that after Chen and others arrived in Hong Kong, they originally wanted to return to the province on the Zhongshan ship, which had been sent to Hong Kong by the Fourth Fleet in advance to welcome them. However, because it was not as comfortable as a merchant ship, they temporarily changed to the Taishan ship. However, due to the lateness of buying tickets, only Cai Changrang got three seats in the Western restaurant. Therefore, only Director Jin Zengcheng, Commissioner Huang Jusu, Supervisor Weng Guiqing, and Secretary Deng Sixiao accompanied Chen back to the province. Zhu Jiahua, Chen Ce, and others returned to the province separately on the Dong'an and Jinshan Japanese ships. At 6:40 AM, Chen arrived at Tuisi Garden in Dongshan and had breakfast in the garden. Those who attended included Xu Chongqing, Deng Yanhua, Jin Zengcheng, Li Limin, Luo Wenzhuang, Du Yiqian, Lin Shiqing, Ouyang Ju, Weng Guiqing, Huang Jusu, Zhang Huichang, and Ms. Zhu Guangzhen, Chen's wife. They chatted happily until 8:30 AM. Chen had been away from Guangdong for more than a month, and there were many important provincial affairs awaiting decision. Moreover, today was Tuesday, which happened to be the date of the Provincial Government Standing Committee meeting. Therefore, after having breakfast at Tuisi Garden, he went to the Provincial Government meeting with the key figures. Chen Jitang also visited Chen in the Chairman's office of the Provincial Government at 10:30 AM and had a long conversation. It was learned that they discussed the resolution of the Guilin situation and the winter defense of the province. They parted after 12:00 PM. (December 2nd)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Sends Troops to Suppress Communist Bandits on the Border</h3>
<p>Wang Dinghua's and Tan Langxing's Regiments Depart for Northern Guangdong</p>
<p>Xiang's Division of the Eastern Guangdong Army Advances to Suppress the Bandit Strongholds of Fengshun and Haifeng</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence - Recently, the remnants of the Communist bandits, who were unable to gain a foothold in Hunan and Jiangxi due to the large-scale suppression in those two provinces, have mostly fled south. It has recently been reported that a portion of the Communist bandits has fled to Shangyou in southwestern Jiangxi. Shangyou is only slightly more than 120 miles from Nan'an. Nan'an borders Guangdong at Duxiong. Lu Dipin, Chairman of Jiangxi Province, recently telegraphed the military and political authorities here, requesting the quick dispatch of large forces to northern Guangdong to suppress them from the south, according to circumstances. After receiving the telegram, the Eighth Route Army Headquarters immediately intensified the deployment of defenses in northern Guangdong. In addition to ordering the Third Independent Regiment stationed in northern Guangdong to deploy defenses strictly, it also ordered the regiment commander, Deng Hui, to come to the province to inquire about the border defense situation and receive personal instructions on the plan to defend against the Communists. Deng returned to his post after completing his mission yesterday and received a large batch of bullets and grenades a day earlier, which were transported to the front line for preparation. The headquarters was still worried that Deng's regiment would not have enough troops to divide and defend. Therefore, it specially transferred the remaining troops of the Third Training Regiment, Wang Dinghua, stationed in southern Guangdong, back to the province, along with the first battalion and machine gun company that departed for northern Guangdong the day before. It was learned that the third battalion, mortar company, and special task force of the regiment arrived in the province on the 28th and received six mortars and 300 shells from the headquarters. They are scheduled to go to Shaozhou during the day. The headquarters also transferred the 220th Regiment of the 63rd Division, Tan Langxing's troops, from the Jiangfang area of Guangxi back to Guangdong. The regiment was ordered to depart from Mengjiang on the 26th on more than 20 civilian ships and arrived at Sanshui River mouth on the morning of the 28th. They immediately transferred from River mouth to the Guangzhou-Sanshui railway to return to the province. After concentrating in Huangsha to replenish their military supplies, they departed today on the Guangdong-Shaozhou railway in three batches to Shaoquan. Currently, northern Guangdong is equipped with the troops of Deng, Wang, and Tan. As soon as the bandits' tracks are confirmed, they will launch separate attacks. As for eastern Guangdong, Zhang Da's brigade of the 62nd Division, Xiang Hanping's troops, has deployed defenses along the Guangdong border that borders southeastern Jiangxi. At the same time, they are also suppressing the Communist bandits in the interior in separate zones. According to a report from the 245th Regiment of the division, when the regiment advanced to suppress the remnants of the Communist bandits in Yangxikeng, Fengshun County, last month, they discovered dozens of wounded and sick soldiers of the bandit army when they arrived at Gedutou Market. More than ten were killed on the spot, and 22 were captured alive. Another eight or nine bandits were killed in Yangxikeng. On the same day, four local guns were seized in the Jinjing forest. In addition, the training regiment of the division advanced to suppress the Communist bandits in Baihanghu, Punin County. On the 29th, they encountered more than 100 bandits at Dayuanxia, ​​and immediately launched a head-on attack, killing more than 60 bandits, seizing ten local guns, more than 100 rounds of ammunition, and a red flag. Furthermore, more than 200 Communist bandits were discovered in Baishui, Haifeng, and other places. Fortunately, they were discovered by the defense army, which immediately sent a team to surround and suppress them, wounding and killing dozens of Communist bandits, beheading three, and seizing a large number of propaganda materials. The fake General Headquarters was completely destroyed by burning. (November 30th)</p>
<h3>Chai Chunlin Talks About Shandong Government Property</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence - Chai Chunlin, Director of the Shandong Government Property Clearing Office, has been in office for more than twenty days. Today, Chai made the following statement to the press: The Shandong Government Property Clearing Office was established during the tenure of Chairman Chen (Diaoyuan). At that time, the income was far less than the expenditure, and the total expenditure was 40,000 or 50,000 yuan, while the income was only more than 2,000 yuan. Therefore, it was once suspended when the Jin army came to Shandong. After the Central Army recovered Jinan, Chairman Han returned to the province to preside over Shandong's administration and appointed Chunlin as the director of the Government Property Clearing Office to continue clearing Shandong's government property. The expenses were reduced compared to before, and the current monthly expenditure is only more than 2,000 yuan. Shandong's government property is roughly divided into two categories: Jinan and other counties. In Jinan, the government property has been cleared many times by the government in the past, and most of the major properties have been sold. Now, it is only collecting the remaining money. Currently, the government property in Jinan consists of government land and houses, that is, government-owned land leased to merchants at a price for them to build houses. It has now been decided to sell them all, ordering the merchants who lease the government land to buy the land at a price to confirm their ownership, and the government will issue formal land deeds. In other counties, there is more government property. In areas such as Huimin, Caozhou, Shanxian, and Yidu, clearing committees have been assigned to investigate. Most of the land in Huimin, Caozhou, and Shanxian is wasteland caused by river silt. In the past, people often had major disputes over the wasteland. It has been reported that in the Jiyang area, hundreds of people were beaten to death due to disputes over land. It has now been decided to order people to buy all the silted land and issue formal land deeds to eliminate future disputes. In Yidu, there is a lot of land and houses belonging to the Manchus. It has now been decided to confiscate their public property. All privately owned houses and land of the Manchus will not be confiscated. This matter was discussed and resolved during Chairman Chen's tenure, and it is only being implemented now. Moreover, most of the property of the Manchus is controlled by a few people, and many tenants resist paying grain taxes to the landlords. The Manchus only have the name of having property, but do not get the actual benefits. Now, after the sale, their ownership is confirmed, and 30% is allocated for local industry and education, which is a win-win situation. As for the total amount of Shandong's government property, since Chunlin has only been in office for more than 20 days, he is still in the investigation period and cannot yet make statistics. Although the Ministry of Finance and the Shandong Department of Finance have conducted investigations in the past, they were not very accurate. The Government Property Clearing Office is scheduled to be cleared within six months. In addition to the government property that can be sold to the people at a price, the remaining property will be handed over to the responsible agencies for continued management after clearing. The Government Property Office will be closed and will not be extended. (December 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ship "Dairimaru" Violently Assaults Chinese</h3>
<p>Peddler Chen Wenfa Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Perpetrator Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence - Some time ago, the Japanese merchant ship "Xiangyangmaru," which passed through Wuhu, violently assaulted passenger Ding Changming, resulting in his death. Various circles in Wuhu were aroused by righteous indignation and formed the Ding Case Support Association as a backing for negotiations. This case has not yet been resolved. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the Japanese ship "Dairimaru" instructed its servants to beat a peddler, causing serious injury. A peddler named Chen Wenfa lives in Wuhu and sells sundries on various ships on the Yangtze River for a meager profit. On the afternoon of the 4th, he took the "Dairimaru" from Anqing to Wuhu. It happened to be extremely cold after the snow. Chen went to the side of the furnace cabin to get warm. At that time, the ship had traveled to Digang, dozens of miles away from Wuhu. The furnace servants came out to drive him away, which led to an argument. Unexpectedly, the Japanese on the ship ordered several servants to beat Chen arbitrarily on the deck, causing Chen to suffer bone fractures, muscle injuries, and heart shock, and he immediately lost consciousness. Then, they hung him up with a rope and beat him severely. At that time, Chen's companions and all the passengers on the ship were extremely angry. They gathered together and negotiated with the shipowner. The Japanese, unable to resist the public anger, finally agreed to hand over the perpetrators Yu Azhang, He Ayao, and Shi Amao to the Chinese authorities for legal proceedings after arriving in Wuhu. The ship arrived in Wuhu this morning. The Water Patrol Police Station received a report and, in addition to taking the perpetrators Yu Azhang, He Ayao, and Shi Amao to the station and carrying the injured Chen Wenfa ashore, reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to send Inspector Wang and others to board the ship and negotiate with the shipowner, Japanese man Wenbaojin Guotaro, and Chinese buyer Chen Wenxin. The Japanese initially made excuses, but after a long period of theoretical discussion, they admitted to being responsible for Chen Wenfa's medical expenses and a daily allowance of 2 yuan for family support during the injury recovery period. If Chen died as a result of his injuries, the negotiations would be reserved for later. The perpetrators Yu Azhang and others were detained in Wuhu and handed over to the local court for trial. The ship did not leave Wuhu until the afternoon and then sailed to Shanghai. It is reported that Chen Wenfa's injuries are very serious, and it is not yet known whether he is in danger of dying. The Wuhu Local Court has dispatched a prosecutor to examine the matter after receiving the report and has brought Yu Azhang and others back to the court for trial. (5th)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government to Hand Over Affairs on the 15th</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government has already been ordered by the National Government to reorganize. Various departments are rushing to complete the handover. The finance and civil affairs departments have already finished their preparations. However, the new commissioners have not yet arrived in Hangzhou, and there is no news as to when they will take office. Each department has no choice but to prepare for departmental affairs as soon as possible. It has now been decided that December 15th will be the date for the complete handover of the provincial government. If the new commissioners can arrive in Hangzhou within the next few days, the handover will be carried out on the 15th so that the old staff can be relieved of their responsibilities as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding the funding of the provincial government's various agencies, only the education expenses will be paid in advance before the New Year holiday, following the precedent of the previous year. The arrears for November will be cleared, and the funds for December and other agencies will only be planned and issued after the reorganization of the provincial government is completed. As for the Hangzhou Municipal Government, it has already completed its handover. Mayor Cai Zengji has already submitted his resignation. It is said that the provincial government will not appoint anyone to the position of mayor for the time being, but will wait for the new commissioners to take office before making an announcement.</p>
<h3>Liaoning Provincial Government Maintains Food Supply for the People</h3>
<p>A communication from Fanyang states that the Liaoning Provincial Grain Industry Association believes that the new grain entering the market has slightly eased the food situation. However, the population of the provincial capital is large, and the demand is huge, exceeding 3,000 piculs per day. This year should be fine, but it is difficult to predict what the autumn harvest next year will be like and whether the grain market will soar. In order to plan ahead, it is worthwhile for grain merchants to purchase and stockpile grain now that the new grain prices are low, and then sell it at a small profit next year to maintain the people's food supply. However, due to the current tight financial situation, grain merchants are unable to purchase grain. Furthermore, unscrupulous merchants are colluding with foreigners to speculate and make profits, which is a cause for concern.</p>
<p>Recently, the General Chamber of Commerce has specially submitted a request to the provincial government to grant a loan of 5 million yuan in silver, referring to the previous commercial loan case, to be used for purchasing and stockpiling grain. The General Chamber of Commerce is currently forwarding the request with detailed information. Lu Muting, the General Manager of the Sino-Eastern Three Provinces Official Bank, has also submitted a request to the provincial government to allow the bank's branches in 19 locations, including Kaiyuan, Gongzhuling, Sipingjie, Taonan, Liaoyuan, Tongliao, Faku, Shanchengzi, Xi'an, Changtu, Dongfeng, Xifeng, Xinmin, Liaoyang, Tieling, Bamiancheng, Xinlitun, Hailong, and Benxi, to offer loans against stockpiled grain in order to assist grain merchants and stimulate the market. At the same time, the provincial government has formulated measures to maintain the people's food supply and issued a notice to all counties to comply with the following: 1. Strictly investigate those who smuggle red grain out of the country. If anyone is found to be disobeying the order, the red grain will be confiscated and punished. 2. All distilleries in the counties are prohibited from purchasing red grain, as they have accumulated large quantities of it over the years. At this time of food shortage, anyone who accumulates it without authorization will be assessed and forced to sell it. 3. The counties in western Liaoning that have been affected by disasters are particularly short of food. The counties should transport grain for sale to avoid starvation among the people. 4. Soup kitchens should be set up in the counties. If the relief distribution is insufficient, the counties may increase it at their discretion.</p>
<h3>Northeast Match Monopoly Implemented</h3>
<p>A communication from Jiyang states that there are only a few domestic match merchants in the Northeast, including Huilin, Sheng Sheng, Sanming, Guandong, Danhua, Zhongzhi, and Jinhua. Over the years, they have been oppressed by foreign merchants and their businesses have been unable to develop, often facing danger. In order to promote domestic goods and protect the development of the Northeast match industry, the Northeast authorities have long planned to implement a Northeast match monopoly system. The Finance Department of Liaoning Province has previously reviewed the local situation and drafted monopoly regulations, which were submitted to the provincial government and then to the Northeast Political Affairs Committee for review and approval for trial implementation. The regulations have also been distributed to the provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe for unified implementation. Active preparations are currently underway. However, due to the initial establishment, there are many aspects to consider and everything must be carefully planned. The various requirements that match merchants must comply with are particularly urgent and should be prepared in advance to avoid temporary complications. The match merchants have been ordered to make preparations together so that they can be implemented on a regular basis. The monopoly regulations are excerpted below:</p>

<p>38. If there are any matters not covered by these regulations after their implementation, they may be amended by order at any time. (December 3)</p>
<h3>Analogy of Factional Strife in Soviet Russia</h3>
<p>Trotskyist Faction is Energetic</p>
<p>Special Martial Law Declared in Eastern and Western Borders</p>
<p>A communication from Harbin states that the Soviet Union recently cracked down on the case of Professor Ramzin, the leader of the anti-Stalin faction, and General Blyukher (aka Galen), and more than ten others. The investigation has been completed. In order to warn against the activities of the opposition, the Stalin faction converted the venue of the Trade Union Congress into a courtroom to accommodate thousands of spectators and conducted a public trial. According to the prosecutor, Ramzin and others were charged with five counts: 1. Attempting to rebel by systematically disrupting various Soviet industries, causing great damage to Soviet construction and destabilizing the regime in order to revive the Trotskyist regime; 2. Believing that in order to establish Trotsky's power and consolidate the foundation of socialism, it was necessary to overthrow the Soviet regime by force, and therefore claiming to be the Industrial Party to contact other counter-revolutionary groups; 3. Fearing that domestic forces alone could not defeat the Soviet regime, they contacted overseas counter-revolutionary groups, received national funding, and provided opportunities for armed intervention; 4. Simultaneously plotting to invade the Soviet Union under the instigation of France; 5. Establishing a planned scheme to investigate and carry out the above conspiracies. The counter-revolutionary economic plan proposed by Professor Ramzin, the leader of the conspiracy, was as follows: Transforming the Soviet Union into a government that is subordinate to the Western political system, which involves various discussions of imperial politics, aiming for a conference system, which is to say, constitutional politics. However, after the establishment of this new regime, it is believed that military dictatorship must be carried out first. Regarding foreign trade, it is suspected of rejecting state monopolies and restoring the previous capitalism. However, since it is very difficult to fundamentally reform the previous enterprises, it is planned to transform them into joint-stock organizations with the help of the leaders of Yugometall and others. In the agricultural sector, it is planned to return the land to the previous owners before the revolution and fully implement individualism. To implement the above plan, foreign armed intervention is first used to defeat the Soviet regime. As for the propaganda method of the revolution, it is planned to set up a network in the central parts of various industries so that any flaws that occur will affect the whole. This network has about forty or fifty people directly related to the central government, and the local organizations related to the central government number about four or five hundred people. The laborers involved in this conspiracy are said to number more than two thousand. It is also reported that although Ramzin and Blyukher have been arrested, their followers are still active outside, so special emergency martial law has been declared on the eastern and western borders of Soviet Russia.

<h3>Summary of Important News</h3>
<h3>Local Communication: Songjiang</h3>
<p>The county government dispatched police to escort the communist suspect. Pan Yongqiang, director of the Tinglin First Public Security Bureau, dispatched patrol officer Yang and several water police officers to Mapengtou on the 4th to investigate a robbery case involving a certain surname. They encountered a person in Western clothes with a rattan basket, who looked flustered and uneasy. Upon seeing the police, he threw his bag into the river. Patrol Officer Yang, realizing that something was amiss, attempted to search him, but the suspect turned around and tried to escape. He was apprehended after a struggle, as he was very strong. Just then, the police team dispatched by the county government to Hougang passed by and, hearing the commotion, went ashore and captured the suspect. The rattan basket in the river was retrieved by a team member and found to contain communist propaganda. The suspect was not a local and was probably dispatched from another area. It is said that several accomplices staying in the town heard the news and escaped. The rattan basket contained a folder with recorded place names and party members' names, a bottle of opium paste, and many propaganda items. However, he has not yet been handed over to the county. It is said that the First Branch Bureau and the police team are competing to hand him over to Songjiang to show their merit, resulting in a deadlock. The county government believes that since the arrest of the suspect was due to the cooperation of both parties, neither party's contribution should be diminished, and that the matter should not be allowed to escalate into a dispute that could affect future cooperation. Therefore, it has telegraphed both parties to await the dispatch of police officers from the county government to Tinglin to escort the suspect back for interrogation. The police have already taken the order to Tinglin and should be able to return to Songjiang tomorrow. On the same day, Patrol Officer Ni was also investigating a case when he spotted a suspicious person at a certain location. A water police officer recognized him as Gong, a member of Taibao Ashu's gang and a former vanguard from Qianxu. He was apprehended. After interrogation, a Mauser pistol was found in the home of a villager nearby, and he was escorted back to Tinglin. Two accomplices were also arrested on the way. The investigation is currently underway.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Silk Factories Resuming Work Intermittently: Since the general strike that broke out on the 2nd at all 45 silk factories in the city, all parties of the party, government, and police have been working hard to handle the situation, and it has gradually calmed down. In addition to the ten silk factories in the Zhoushanbang area, including Qianfeng, which resumed work the day before yesterday, nine factories, including Zhengyi, Yongtai, Yuankang, Yisheng 1, Yisheng 2, Zhenfeng, Yufeng, and Xiesheng, resumed work intermittently yesterday morning. The county party rectification committee held its 75th committee meeting and decided that Wang Pin, a party member, was involved in initiating the labor unrest, which was a violation of party discipline. They collected evidence and submitted it to the provincial party rectification committee, which then submitted it to the central government for permanent expulsion of Wang Pin from the party. At the same time, the county labor rectification committee also held its 5th meeting and decided to submit a request to the county government to issue a clear order to arrest the main culprits of the labor unrest, Ye Gongyun and Tao Shensheng, and the perpetrators of the riots, Chuan Bingmo, and bring them to justice. Furthermore, the various industry trade unions in the county believe that the labor unrest incited by a small number of troublemakers in the silk factories has not only affected the future of the silk industry but also hindered the labor movement in the entire county. Therefore, they held a joint meeting at the labor rectification committee yesterday to discuss the attitude that the various industry trade unions should take towards the silk factory labor unrest. Representatives from trade unions in industries such as Shenxin, Chuzhan, flour, and construction attended the meeting. First, the representatives expressed their opinions, and then the following matters were decided: 1. The trade unions will jointly issue a declaration to all workers in the silk industry, urging them not to be exploited by others to harm the overall situation and bring ruin upon themselves. 2. The silk industry employers are urged to abide by the arbitration decision and not to engage in further triangulation. 3. A report will be submitted to the party, government, and labor rectification committee to state their position of persuasion. 4. The responsible personnel of each industry trade union should strictly prevent reactionary elements from taking advantage of the situation. 5. In response to the reports of suspects being arrested by the county government in the silk factory disputes, in addition to those who are demonstrably disturbing the peace and will be interrogated and punished according to the law, the county should be requested to conduct a thorough investigation to avoid innocent people being implicated. Furthermore, Wang Xiubao, the female standing committee member of the Ruichang Silk Factory Trade Union in Zhoushanbang, and Chuan Apin, the female standing committee member of the Qianfeng Silk Factory Trade Union, were arrested and detained by the county government for allegedly participating in directing the strike. It has been three days. The labor rectification committee, at the request of all the female workers in Zhoushanbang, pleaded for leniency due to their ignorance and specially submitted a request to the county government for temporary bail. County Magistrate Pan has approved the temporary bail of Wang Xiubao and Chuan Apin.</p>
<p>Zhou Yangzhao Repeatedly Accused: Zhou Yangzhao, the chief of the Fifth Public Security Branch Bureau in Jiangyin Lane, outside the North Gate of the county, has been accused of neglecting police duties, corruption, and violating the law since taking office.

Recently, Party member Tingbiao of the Sixth Branch Department of the First District listed three points of evidence: 1. Li Jie, a resident of Houqili, outside the North Gate, was arrested by the chief of the branch bureau, Zhou Yangzhao, in collusion with detective Ruan Renqing, leading police officers and hooligans such as Feng Licheng to Li's house under the pretext of searching for prohibited items. However, no evidence was found at the time, and Li Jie was injured and filed a report with the county government, which confirmed the injuries. 2. On June 1 this year, at 11:00 p.m., four gamblers, Hui Ronggen, Wang Maolin, Wang Shougen, and Xie Amao, were caught at No. 29 Jiyu Street and taken to the branch bureau, where they were each fined six yuan without a receipt, which was pocketed privately. 3. Guo Huanzhang and Ren Yunhe, who sell small books opposite the Bank of Communications outside the North Gate, were arrested by the chief of the branch bureau for allegedly obstructing traffic and were fined 20.08 yuan without a receipt. Therefore, yesterday, a request was submitted to the First District Party Department, which forwarded it to the County Party Rectification Committee, to send a letter to the county government to promptly dismiss Zhou Yangzhao, the chief of the branch bureau, from his post for investigation and prosecution.</p>

On the night of the incident, at around 10 p.m., seven or eight robbers suddenly came to his door and called for Wenping to open the door.

<p>Rice Boats Robbed in the Lake and Marsh Area: Dai Bingfu, a resident of Donggang Jing Township in this county, specializes in the rice business. Several days ago, he loaded a boat with about one hundred and some odd shih of unhusked rice. Together with two partners, he went to Wuxi to sell it. Within a few days, the rice was sold out. Prior to this, a relative had asked Dai to purchase some clothing materials in Wuxi. After making the purchase, he set off from there on the day before yesterday (the 4th).</p>
<p>He was not far from home when suddenly two boats came straight at them. They approached Dai's boat, and more than ten bandits jumped onto it, shouting for them to stop. The bandits, each wielding sharp knives and iron rulers, etc., were led by a figure holding a handgun who seemed to be the head of the gang. He directed everything on the boat. The bandits swarmed aboard and first tied up Dai and his two companions with ropes. Then they searched the boat. Fortunately, Dai was usually quite cautious, and after receiving over 690 yuan for the rice, he had hidden it in four different places. The bandits only found one stash and robbed them of about 140 yuan in silver dollars and around 200 yuan worth of clothing materials entrusted to him for tailoring. After the robbery, the bandits returned to their boats and fled.</p>

Around fifty yards, China's Shi Jinsheng and Wang Mingzhi bravely moved forward. At that time, the Chinese team's situation was the best.</p>
<h3>Major Changes on Robison Road</h3>
<p>The order on Brenan Road was similar to before. There were major changes on Robison Road. Individual Faras gained the lead as a result of his efforts. Second place went to Russia's Chima Ming, third place to Portugal's Lamidi, China's Zhou Yuyu, Britain's King, Davis, and Shipham, all following behind.</p>
<h3>Zhou Yuyu Takes the Lead Again</h3>
<p>On Hungjao Road, Zhou Yuyu surpassed Faras and took the lead again. Britain already had three people within the top nine. Russia and Ireland each had one person. China only had Zhou Yuyu in first place and Hou Genren in seventh. Shi Jinsheng and Zhou Ruquan were far behind. Passing the 11-mile station, the order of the top ten was: Britain had four people in second, third, seventh, and eighth place. Portugal had one person in third place (passing the station shoulder to shoulder with a Briton). Russia had one person in sixth place. China had Zhou Yuyu in first place, Hou Genren in first, Zhou Ruquan in tenth, and Shi Jinsheng was still lagging behind by two hundred yards.</p>
<h3>The Competition Between China and Britain Intensifies</h3>
<p>Between Haig Road, Avenue Joffre, and Avenue Foch, the athletes from China and Britain were engaged in a fierce battle, and the situation became intense. At that time, it seemed that Britain would not be able to maintain its superior trend. Although four team members were in the top ten, first and second place already belonged to China's Zhou Yuyu and Hou Genren. Shi Jinsheng was in seventh place. Zhou Ruquan had already stirred up his spirits and was striving to improve, gradually moving forward from the twentieth position.</p>
<h3>Cheering Music Plays as Zhou Enters the Field</h3>
<p>At around 2:31, the military band at the racecourse started playing loudly. Ten thousand heads in the grandstand moved simultaneously, vying to see Zhou Yuyu of China enter the field with strong strides, a graceful posture, and a natural expression. He reached the finish line in 2 hours, 32 minutes, and 25 seconds, winning the overall championship. As Ji Genren entered, music and applause rose at the same time. Within the next three minutes, Britain's King, individual Newgebert, and China's Shi Jinsheng reported one after another. Soon after, Britain's Shipham and Moisan also arrived. All four British athletes had arrived, scoring a total of 20 points. China had three athletes, scoring a total of 8 points, giving them the advantage. If Zhou Ruquan had been late, then the honor of the entire Chinese team would have been lost. Fortunately, Zhou also knew the importance of his responsibility. At this critical moment, success could not be achieved without redoubled effort. His courage suddenly increased, and he walked quickly, following behind Portugal's Lamidi to reach the finish line. In total score, China ranked first with 17 points, and Britain ranked second with 20 points. The remaining four teams had two or three athletes. Some had one or two athletes. Therefore, they did not get the score.</p>

<h3>Chairman MacKinnon's Speech</h3>
<p>The designated competition time (3 hours and 15 minutes) has expired. The prize-giving ceremony was held inside the grandstand. Chairman MacKinnon said in his speech that today is truly one of the most memorable days in the history of sports in Shanghai. People from all countries cheered and laughed to celebrate the great success of this year's International Walking Competition. The participation of six countries, including Britain, Ireland, Russia, Portugal, and France, and fifty-one athletes, was the largest number in previous years. The enthusiastic participation of Chinese people has increased interest immeasurably, and it is particularly sufficient to show the increase in international friendship. We should now congratulate the Chinese team, which has won the championship for two consecutive years and has now won the championship again, on their success. Also, those who have completed the entire course within the specified competition time have great perseverance and are very admirable. In addition, this competition is fortunate to have the enthusiastic preparation of the various committee members such as Burgess, Lyon, and Pisslai, and the strong support of the British and French concession authorities, resulting in this excellent outcome. In addition, Mr. Ashton and Mr. Cheng Yize also provided a lot of assistance, and the Continental Daily News also specially published extra editions, which are particularly appreciated. Finally, I hope that tomorrow there will be more teams and athletes and create a more interesting international competition.</p>
<h3>Mrs. MacKinnon Presents Awards</h3>
<p>Next, Vice President Mrs. MacKinnon presented the awards. The first to step onto the stage amidst thunderous applause were the four heroes of China: Zhou Yuyu, Hou Genren, Shi Jinsheng, and Zhou Ruquan. Next were the British King, Davis, Shipham, and Moisan. The award for the oldest competitor went to the 53-year-old Neiert, and the award for the youngest competitor went to Gong Jintao of China, who is 17 years old. Before the closing of the conference, there were mutual cheers that shook the fields.</p>

<h3>Zhenru's Triumphant Work</h3>
<p>5 to 2 Victory Over Shanghai Team</p>
<p>|Spectators beamed with joy|</p>
<p>The weather was warm and pleasant with a gentle breeze, making it a perfect day for a good soccer game. Yesterday afternoon, in this pleasant atmosphere, the Zhenru soccer team defeated the Shanghai team by a score of 5 to 2 at the Chinese baseball field. The spectators were overjoyed and cheered. This was a scene from a Group A match, and it is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Avenging Former Losses, Athletes Like Dragons and Tigers</h3>
<p>Zhenru's performance in the Group A matches has been mixed, with one win and one loss, which is rather disappointing. First, they defeated the Western Police, then lost to the Western Police. Then, they lost to the Shanghai team. Yesterday, they took revenge. Since Zhenru lost to the Shanghai team, they were determined to avenge their loss yesterday. Their performance was exceptional. Each player showed great energy and spirit, and their coordination was excellent. It must be said that their great victory over their enemies was a triumphant achievement.</p>
<h3>5 to 2, Crushing the Shanghai Army</h3>
<p>In terms of the situation of the two armies, Zhenru was superior to Shanghai. The first half was very even. Zhenru scored first, but the Shanghai team equalized, making it a tie. In the second half, Zhenru's momentum was too strong. Dai Linjing and Chen Zhenhe each scored one goal, and then Dai scored two more goals. The Shanghai team then scored a goal through Huang Maobao Deheng. The result was 5 to 2, a great victory for Zhenru.</p>
<h3>Zhenru Team Lineup</h3>
<p>Liang Guanlian Feng Yunyou Jiang Shanjing Liang Shutang Chen Zhenhe Zhuang Shihong Chen Bingxiang</p>
<p>Fu Hexuan Dai Linxing Chen Jiaqiu Mei Hongbao</p>
<h3>Shanghai Team Lineup</h3>
<p>Cainier Stokes Faping Sun Mao Menlo Xue Wu Heng Tou Ke Erque Sinclair Bao Deheng Baekers</p>
<h3>Good Luck, Lightly Putting the Ball into the Net</h3>
<p>Referee Li Enlian blew the whistle to start the game. Zhenru attacked first. Dai Linjing passed the ball back to Chen Zhenhe for a long shot. Chen Bingxiang's corner kick was also ineffective. The enemy center forward Sinclair advanced alone, but Liang Guanlian rushed out and saved it. Left winger Hengtou came to attack, but fortunately, the ball went wide. In such a mixed battle, sometimes north and sometimes south, Dai Linjing got the ball and quickly passed it to the right. Mei Hongbao grabbed it and rushed straight towards the goal. Although the enemy goalkeeper Cainier missed, Chen Bingxiang rushed up and gently pushed the ball into the net. This was 15 minutes after the start of the game.</p>
<h3>One Slip, the Country Divided in Half</h3>
<p>After Zhenru won a goal, cheers suddenly rose. Not long after, the enemy right winger Baekers invaded from the edge. Feng Yunyou went to block him, but slipped and touched the ball about twenty yards from the goal. The enemy got a very good free kick. Baekers kicked it diagonally, and just as the ball was about to fall in front of the goal, Ke Erque hit it right in the middle, and it became a tie. After that, the ball's momentum suddenly slowed down, with alternating long shots between the two sides. The first half ended in a 1 to 1 draw.</p>
<h3>Center Forward Dai Overcomes the Enemy in Three Minutes</h3>
<p>Changing sides, Chen Bingxiang slanted to the right. The ball happened to enter the goal with his hand. It was a pity. Who knew that what was lost in the east would be gained in the west? Within two or three minutes, the ball went from Mei Hongbao to Fu Hexuan to Chen Bingxiang who hook passed to Dai Linjing in the middle. The speed of the divine soldiers was amazing. The spectators marveled.</p>
<h3>Little Black Carbon Makes a Miraculous Feat with One Kick</h3>
<p>With the score now 2 to 1, Zhenru's momentum was greatly increased. The ball was often in Shanghai's territory. Mei Hongbao did not release or give up, but circled left and right. Seeing the enemy Sun Mao coming to chase, he passed it to Zhuang Shihong. Mei recovered the ball with a single turn and passed it to Dai. It was neither too high nor too low. Who knew that the goalkeeper happened to deflect it? Chen Zhenhe rushed up and added a kick, making it 3 to 1.</p>
<h3>Yellow Hair Achieves Success, Tormenting the Enemy Like Fighting</h3>
<p>With Zhenru scoring again and again, the enemy was like a frightened bird, distracted, and running was not as fast as Zhenru's. As a result, they reached the end of their strength. The ball went from Chen Zhenhe to Mei Hongbao to Dai Linjing, who drove straight in and built a new miracle and made it 4 to 1. After suffering heavy losses, Hengtou, Xue Wu, and Stokes were slightly injured, so they struggled. Hengtou secretly passed the ball to Bao Deheng, and Huang Mao broke through the iron gate with one kick.</p>
<h3>Great Success, the Goal Hit Twice</h3>
<p>At this time, there were still ten minutes left to the end of the game. In terms of the momentum of the ball, Zhenru could have no worries. Dai Linjing scored another goal, but it was not counted because of offside. He scored another goal. Bao Chi was at the gate, and the goalkeeper bent over and wanted to hold it. But it rolled into the small goal. After standing up, he could not help but laugh at himself for losing the ball. With the ball scored, Zhenru's victory was set.</p>

<h3>Tianma Wins the Ping Pong Champagne Cup</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Final｜Jiande Forfeits</p>
<p>The Ping Pong Championship Champagne Cup, which has been much talked about, has been underway since mid-September.</p>
<h3>Yu Yu (No. 5) of the First Week of China, Walking Posture Mid-Journey (Photographed by Xue Hong)</h3>
<p>It has been three months, and yesterday was the date for the final between the Tianma team and the Jiande team, both determined to win. At the appointed time of 8 o'clock, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association was already packed, creating a new era of enthusiasm never seen before in the ping pong world. Unexpectedly, it was already 8:20, but the Jiande team had not arrived. Therefore, the referees Jiro Ikeda and Mr. Wang Xinkang announced that the Jiande team had forfeited, and Tianma won the third Ping Pong Champagne Cup Championship with a score of seven to zero. Mr. Xu Duo recorded the event. Mr. Wang Naizhi, representative of the organizing committee of the cup competition, gave a speech, and Ms. You Hong Muchen gave the awards. In addition to the champion and runner-up (the runner-up prize was collected by the organizing committee on their behalf), the third-place Guangdong team and the fourth-place Youjia team were each presented with a commemorative flag.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Yu Binqi summoned ping pong masters from various teams on the spot to form a mixed team to play an exhibition match against the Tianma team. Japanese ping pong masters Osada, Ikeda, Yamaki, etc., also joined in the performance, which was extremely exciting. The guests also nodded in satisfaction. However, the organizing committee of the cup competition, on the one hand, felt disappointed that the guests had come from afar and had not been adequately attended to. In addition to returning the ticket money, they expressed their deep apologies. On the other hand, they sighed about the lack of sportsmanship shown by the Jiande team in forfeiting, and were also very grateful for the warm feelings and elegance of the masters from various teams. When the refreshments were finished and the meeting adjourned, it was already late at night.</p>

<h3>Jiangnan University Football Dispute: Fudan's Statement Regarding Guanghua</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Chen Bingde, sports instructor of Fudan University, sent a letter saying: To the editor, I am writing to you regarding the minor dispute in the recent Fudan vs. Guanghua football match. I originally wanted to avoid further trouble, but I noticed that the letter from the Guanghua Sports Department published in your newspaper the day before yesterday contained some discrepancies in the facts. Therefore, I must report the situation at that time. On the day of the match, in order to maintain order, I instructed the school workers to fence off both sides of the field with long benches, with Guanghua students seated on the east side and our school's students on the west side, clearly demarcated. Subsequently, nine carloads of Guanghua students arrived one after another and took their seats. Later, the Guanghua cheerleading squad paraded around the field, and when they passed in front of our school's students' seats, our school's cheerleading squad stood up to show their goodwill. The cheering was intense on both sides at the beginning of the match, and there were no unexpected incidents in the first half. However, in the second half, Guanghua player Xi Qiaosheng dribbled the ball forward, and our school's player Xie Guozhu followed behind. Due to excessive speed, Xie Guozhu touched Xi Qiaosheng's heel, and Xi Qiaosheng twisted and punched Xie Guozhu. At the same time, some students from the Guanghua students' seats, wearing cheerleading paper hats, entered the field to help beat Xie Guozhu with fists and feet. Seeing this situation, our school's cheerleading squad, in order to protect Xie Guozhu's life, ran over from the opposite side to mediate. At the same time, several gunshots rang out from the Guanghua students' seats, which further disrupted the order of the field. After much mediation, the match continued safely. Although there were occasional conflicts between the players, this was common and fortunately there was no second instance of spectators entering the field to help fight, so the match was able to be completed. I am writing this to report the situation, and the reporters who were present to watch the match should also be clear about it. I earnestly request that this letter be published in your newspaper so that those who are concerned about this dispute can understand the truth. I respectfully await your response. Chen Bingde, Sports Instructor of Fudan University, December 7th.</p>

<h3>The Xin Dingxiang Case Resolved</h3>
<p>Fundamental Solution:: Withdrawal of French Sailors, No More Landings</p>
<p>Immediate Solution:: Compensation of $4,000 to the Xin Family</p>
<p>Mediated by Yu Qiaqing and Du Yuesheng</p>
<p>The sampan operator Xin Dingxiang was shot into the Huangpu River by French sailors and tragically drowned. Various fellow villagers associations and labor unions organized the Xin Case Support Association to actively provide assistance. The French consul, in order to maintain friendly relations between China and France, entrusted Mr. Du Yuesheng, a Chinese director of the French Concession, to mediate. Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a local businessman, and Mr. Chen Yi, a Standing Committee member of the Municipal Party Department's Civil Training Committee, also assisted in the mediation. At 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, Yu Qiaqing led Xin Dingxiang's father, Xin Hesheng, wife, Xin Shishi, Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association representative Dong Xinqin, and Support Association representatives Cheng Zhiliang, Wang Changyuan, Li Guangxian, and Ni Yaoxian to Du's residence to discuss a solution. The results were: ㈠ Regarding the fundamental solution, the French authorities ordered the French sailors stationed on Tiantang Street to completely withdraw and no longer land. ㈡ Regarding the immediate solution, the French authorities compensated the Xin Dingxiang family with $4,000. Everyone considered this satisfactory. Xin Hesheng signed and received the money. It was also jointly decided that of the $4,000 compensation, $2,000 would be given to Xin Shishi and $2,000 to Xin Hesheng. The tragic case was thus concluded. The Support Association also issued a declaration stating that the sampan operator Xin Dingxiang was killed by French sailors from the French imperialist warship Waldeck-Rousseau for demanding ferry fare. Since the incident occurred a month ago, the association has been committed to upholding justice and fairness, leading the masses to run and shout, and has sent telegrams to the government with eight proposed fundamental and immediate solutions, demanding a serious protest. At the same time, the association has expanded publicity, holding a revolutionary spirit to achieve the final goal, with the same hatred and unwavering resolve. Now, the French imperialists, seeing the tense atmosphere among the Chinese people, have realized the failure of the gunboat policy and have completely accepted the four terms of the proposed immediate solution, such as punishing the murderers, compensation, apology, and guarantee. The association believes that since the French imperialists have regretted their mistakes and the demands for an immediate solution have been met, it can only reluctantly accept the results. It hopes that compatriots across the country will unite in the spirit of revolution to urge the government to use revolutionary diplomatic means to comprehensively resolve all the tragic cases that have occurred in our country throughout history, and to completely abolish all unequal treaties that endanger our country's public rights and slaughter our compatriots. This is the declaration. (Riri News)</p>
<h3>The Anti-Dutch Diplomatic Support Association Held Its First General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Support Xiao Anti-Dutch Conference decided to jointly organize the Republic of China Anti-Dutch Diplomatic Support Association. The first general meeting was convened by the Overseas Chinese Federation at its headquarters. After the ceremony, Chairman Xu Jigong announced the purpose of the meeting, followed by a report from the preparatory member Lin Youren on the results of the anti-Dutch conference representative Wu Mai and others' second petition to Beijing: ㈠ The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to reduce the passport fee to 50 cents per passport, and the validity period has been extended to four years. ㈡ The Sino-Dutch consular treaty is in the process of being abolished. According to letters from overseas Chinese in the Dutch Indies, the Dutch government, after receiving news of the fierce anti-Dutch sentiment in China, knows that the Chinese people are no longer what they used to be and has decided to cancel Article 109 of the Dutch Indies regulations on January 1 next year to treat overseas Chinese equally. Whether this rumor can be realized depends entirely on whether our country's anti-Dutch movement can continue to move forward with national unity. We must not regard the Dutch as deceiving and mistakenly believe that it is a real pie, thus limiting our resistance, so that the real pie will never be obtained. The constitution was then revised and it was publicly resolved to temporarily borrow the Overseas Chinese Federation at 12 Parker Road as the association's headquarters. The Overseas Chinese Federation, Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association, National Federation of Commerce, British and Dutch Overseas Chinese Expulsion Support Association, Academia Sinica, Seamen's General Union, Vocational Education Society, Great China Record Company Workers' Union, Labor University, Jiaotong University, Jinan University Cultural Department, and other organizations were elected as standing committee members. Lin Youren was then elected as Director-General, Xu Jigong as Finance Director, Ge Tianhao as Propaganda Director, Hu Qichang as Discipline Director, and Zhang Shousong as Liaison Director. The following proposals were also passed: ㈠ Request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seriously negotiate the Xiao case. ㈡ Hire lawyers Wu Mai and Wang Zhonglin as legal advisors. ㈢㈣㈤ (omitted).</p>
<h3>The Case of Dutch Ship Owners Mistreating Chinese Laborers</h3>
<p>Victims Suffer From Venereal Disease</p>
<p>Old-Age Pensions Poisoned</p>
<p>Now Certified by Doctors</p>
<p>The Dutch Rotterdam Lloyd Shipping Company's Abbekerk had a Chinese laborer named Tao Agui, 42 years old, from Linhai County, Zhejiang Province. His elderly mother, wife, and children depended on his wages to support the family. On April 17th of last year, at 3:30 AM, the ship was near Hull, England. Agui was refueling on a ladder, but the ladder was slippery due to oil. He fell from the top of the ladder, breaking his right knee. He was treated at a local hospital in Hull. Initially, medical expenses were provided by the ship owner and insurance company, as it was the practice that seafarers who were injured in the line of duty were to have their expenses covered by the ship owner and insurance company. If the injury resulted in disability, they were to be supported until death or until their son was over 16 years old. If they returned to their place of origin, they were to be given a pension of four Dutch guilders per day (currently equivalent to about five Chinese yuan). However, after a doctor diagnosed that Agui's kneecap was broken and he would become disabled, the Abbekerk ship owner and insurance company, fearing that they would have to bear his long-term support, hatched a poisonous plan to bribe the doctor to say that Agui's injury from the fall was healed but that he now had venereal disease, making recovery difficult. The ship owner and insurance company used the doctor's words as evidence to stop Agui's wages and medical expenses. Agui refused to accept this and requested the Chinese consul in Amsterdam to negotiate, but to no avail. Later, the doctor gave him a liquid medicine to drink. Agui was very suspicious that he would be poisoned, so he kept the medicine and did not drink it. Since then, he became disabled and stranded overseas. His fellow Chinese laborers collected some money and he returned to Shanghai in late last month, appealing to the Seamen's Union for help. The Seamen's Union presented the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the consul in Amsterdam to seriously negotiate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that since Tao Agui had returned to China, he could find a doctor in Shanghai to re-examine his injuries to determine whether he had venereal disease or whether the injury was work-related, and then negotiate further. Therefore, the Seamen's Union sent Secretary Li Zuyou and Tao Agui to Dr. Angland at 23 Beijing Road on the morning of the day before yesterday to examine the injured knee bone with X-rays. They obtained a diagnosis and photos of the injury, stating that there was no venereal disease and that the injury was indeed a fracture. Therefore, the Seamen's Union has decided to present the case to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs again, requesting a serious negotiation. The doctor's diagnosis is recorded below. The signer of the certificate is Dr. Angland, a medical doctor from the University of Budapest and a registered doctor in Shanghai. The certificate is as follows: ㈠ I examined Mr. Tao Agui with electric light today and took his photo and X-ray. ㈡ His kneecap is broken into two pieces. One large piece has become small pieces and both pieces have lost contact with the other bones. ㈢ Two copper wires were used to connect these broken bones, but this new connection was unsuccessful. One of the two copper wires has broken into two lines, and the other line is also very weak. The conservative copper wire will likely be connected by other means in the near future. ㈣ Currently, the injured limb has completely lost its function. As for the two copper wires that are connecting the limb, it is not a regular connection, but rather a connection of broken bones. This is a natural physiological phenomenon and has nothing to do with restoring the original state. ㈤ The patient does not have venereal disease under these circumstances. ㈥ A new surgery should be performed immediately. Angland signed.</p>
<h3>Important Information for Overseas Chinese Going to the Dutch Indies</h3>
<p>A Letter From a Dutch Indies Cultural Leader</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Jingwan, a teacher and journalist from Southeast Asia, recently received a letter from a cultural leader in the Dutch Indies stating that since the Dutch government implemented a policy to improve the lives of scholars and maintain unemployed workers, it has become extremely difficult for Chinese citizens to enter the country. Moreover, the situation has recently deteriorated, and the commercial sector has become depressed, with more and more Chinese going to the Dutch Indies. Therefore, the colonial government has imposed restrictions on the entry of Chinese. Intellectuals are seen as tigers and wolves, and it is not easy to suppress overseas Chinese with a high level of education. In order to distinguish between the good and the bad and maintain security, the procedures for Chinese to disembark are becoming increasingly strict (Japanese can enter freely). Even those arrested as criminals are often deported (men and women alike). Therefore, I would like to ask you to inform patriotic overseas Chinese of the following points for reference if they wish to make a living in the Dutch Indies: ㈠ Anyone coming from within the country or from other places in England to the Dutch Indies must present a passport issued by their own government and the consulate of the country where they reside, and must also comply with the new population regulations to avoid difficulties upon arrival. ㈡ Anyone in the education field who carries a diploma must report it under the original name of the diploma to match the facts, otherwise they will not be allowed to disembark. ㈢ Anyone who wants to teach must truthfully report their occupation and must not use the name of high wages to enter the country by deception. If discovered, they will be deported and not allowed to be guaranteed or leave freely. ㈣ If people in the industrial, commercial, and academic fields ask friends or relatives to guarantee their entry, they must report the guarantor's store number, address, and name, and know that they must pay the government's head tax of at least 18 guilders to be approved. Any discrepancies will be rejected. ㈤ Anyone who pays a head tax of more than 18 guilders to the government in the place of residence has the right to have only one person disembark within this year. If they want to guarantee a second person, they must wait until the following year and see if the tax rate has increased before they can guarantee again. The person being guaranteed must work for the guarantor, otherwise it will violate the entry regulations. (6) When traveling to the Dutch Indies by ship, you must have 100 Dutch guilders with you (from January 1, 1931, it will be increased to 150 guilders to pay when registering on the ship. These are the things you need to know when going to the Dutch Indies.</p>
<h3>The Taiwan Chinese General Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed to Urge the Appointment of a Consul in Taiwan</h3>
<p>The Taiwan Chinese General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the National Government and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, saying: (Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang, Mr. Lin Shaonan, I respectfully salute you. Commissioner Yuan was ordered to come to Taiwan to inspect the overseas Chinese on the entire island, and all of them are grateful for the great virtue of our government. However, the appointment of the consul in Taiwan has not been realized after being announced for half a year. Not only are the overseas Chinese eagerly awaiting it, but it is also of great importance to the national system. The commissioner has inspected the entire island, and the people are united and unanimous in their desire to retain him in Taiwan to take office first, and also request that Consul-General Lin come to Taiwan as soon as possible to comfort the wishes of tens of thousands of overseas Chinese. I beg your approval and request a telegram in reply. The Taiwan Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the local chambers of commerce throughout Taiwan respectfully salute you.</p>

<h3>The Shanxi Fellow Villagers Sent a Telegram to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Requesting the Appointment of Kong Xiangxi as Chairman of the Provincial Government</p>
<p>Cheng Jiasen, Sang Yuye, and other Shanxi fellow villagers in Shanghai sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang yesterday, requesting the appointment of Minister Kong Xiangxi as the Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government to handle the aftermath. The original telegram reads: To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government, I respectfully salute you. The disaster in Shanxi Province happened suddenly and the people were in dire straits. We are grateful that you made a decisive decision and wiped out the disaster in one fell swoop. The people deeply appreciate it. Now that the military has been settled, the aftermath needs to be dealt with. The key to comforting and stabilizing the people lies in having the right person in charge. Minister Kong Xiangxi is from Shanxi and has made contributions to the country. His compatibility with his hometown is commendable. At this time when the chaos has just subsided and the people are in dire straits, the elders in the hometown are eagerly awaiting. Jialin and others, who are stranded in Shanghai, are planning for the hometown administration and believe that at this time of transition between military and political affairs, it is crucial to have someone who can govern well. Minister Kong is the most suitable candidate for the position of Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government. After repeated discussions, we respectfully express our wishes and urge you to listen to public opinion and issue a clear order. From now on, the people of Shanxi will govern Shanxi, and the people will be rescued from water and fire by this person. Not only will the living Buddhas praise him, but the armed comrades will also be excited and willing to serve. Jialin and others believe that the matter is urgent for the long-term stability of Shanxi and cannot remain silent. We respectfully send this telegram and ask for your consideration. Respectfully, Cheng Jialin, Sang Yuye, Zhang Shoumei, Gao Tingzhen, Fan Zijue, Yang Juren, Zhang Shen, Peng Guangxi, Qiao Yikao, Jin Gong, Wang Lu, Wang Zizan, and 269 other Shanxi fellow villagers in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Various Circles Telegraphed Congratulations to Minister Kong</h3>
<p>To Lin Kanghou Nanjing Ministry of Industry Kong Minister Jun Jian, I have learned that your Gong Chang Industry is celebrating the good news that you have obtained the news, and I am happy to hear that it has been 300. This telegram is sent to express my congratulations to the Chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Lin Kanghou</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu Nanjing Ministry of Industry Kong Minister Jun Jian, I have just received a call from Shanghai to learn that Rong Ren is the Minister of Industry and his protection of overseas Chinese depends on his new business. Overseas Chinese share in his joy and send a telegram to Hu Wenhu,</p>
<p>Wang Jian and others from the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association telegraphed Kong Kong, Minister of Industry, to inform him that he was reading the order of the national government and learned that the two ministries of industry and agriculture were merged into the Ministry of Industry. He has been elected to the post. The vast number of people in the country are very happy to hear that the Ministry of Industry is under the umbrella. His plans have been carried out to the salvation of the people, and the real plans of the chief have been put into practice. It is the Chinese national goods industry that has no borders, and it is also the light of the future of our party and country. The members of the Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, including Wang Jian, Wang Xingyi, Wang Hanqiang and others, jointly sign the telegraph for not covering all the details.</p>
<h3>Wu Song Gentry Please Do Not Change Wu Song Area</h3>
<p>Wu Song Gentry Yin Xiangsun, Dong Mengyi, Zhang Yuchi, Gu Danchao, Zhang Pan Shi, Zheng Dong, Yin Shu Lin and others proposed to the Shanghai Municipality Committee for the division of urban areas on the area where Wu Song is located.</p>
<p>The division of urban areas is now about to be completed, and Wu Song is planning to draw four maps from Gang 25, 35 to 22, 35 and incorporate them into the Yinhang market. It is found that Wu Song is an open commercial port, and its position should be the same as that of Hu Nan Zhabei and others under special circumstances. Wu Song residents are mostly from other villages, and the traffic is constantly changing. The number of households living in the same room is small, with only five or six households, or three or four households. For example, if five households are used as neighbors, one room and one neighbor will already feel more than enough, and most of them are illiterate workers. In the future, the division of squares and neighborhoods will inevitably feel greatly difficult. This is the first. The four drawings that have been drawn are far away from the Yang Xing, which is connected to Baoshan, such as being incorporated into Yinhang. It is necessary to detour Wu Song and travel more than 30 miles back and forth.</p>
<p>Even the nearest one is almost twenty miles away. The villagers are bound to be very inconvenient in their affairs and will inevitably cause disputes and unnecessary entanglements. This is the second duty. For these two reasons, we jointly submit a statement, hoping that the original area will remain unchanged and not be changed slightly. In the future, the management of local autonomy will not be inconvenient in the local situation and can be used freely.</p>
<h3>Petition from Jiangxi Compatriots Asking Chiang to Go to Jiangxi to Suppress the Communists</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Native Association in Shanghai held its fifth regular meeting a few days ago. The standing committee members Liu Jiu-chuang, Huang Guowen, Huang Bao-xiang, Zeng Shimei, and Liu Zi-zhen, among others, were present. Liu Yu-shu presided over the meeting and reported on the agenda. The meeting immediately resolved: 1) To send a telegram urging Commander-in-Chief Chiang to immediately go to Jiangxi to supervise the suppression of the Communist bandits; 2) To compile and print the second issue of "A True Record of the Communist Bandits' Disaster in Jiangxi" and request Mr. Shen Jiali to contact Mr. Tu Zhongxuan and Mr. Dai Yuheng to collect the materials immediately and submit them for publication. The original text of the telegram urging Commander-in-Chief Chiang is as follows: "To Commander-in-Chief Chiang, Nanjing: Our association previously petitioned for the suppression of the Communist bandits in Jiangxi Province, and we were fortunate to receive your approval. Upon hearing the news, we felt as if we had been reborn. The Communist bandits, upon hearing the news, were frightened and retreated from Ji'an, allowing the troops to recover the lost territory without firing a single shot. However, while the bandits abandoned the broken shoe of Ji'an, they expanded their red flames in various counties. Those suffering from the disaster are as eagerly awaiting rescue as those hanging upside down. The troops suppressing the bandits are only following their tracks and not pursuing them. It is clear that the reason the Communist bandits retreated was due to the prestige of your coming to Jiangxi. The reason why the troops are now watching and waiting is also because they are waiting for your leadership in Jiangxi. As for the people of Nanchang, they hung flags and tied colored silk to welcome the arrival of the imperial envoy after the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, and it has been more than ten days. Our association deeply understands the dangerous situation and dares to implore you again to have compassion and quickly fulfill your previous promise. The sooner you set out, the sooner the people of Jiangsu can be saved. The life and death of tens of millions of people depend entirely on your every move. In haste, we await your orders. Jiangxi Native Association in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>The British Economic Delegation's Statement</h3>
<p>Praising the Generous Hospitality of the National Government</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that the British Economic Delegation, after visiting Beijing for inspection, returned to Shanghai by train with Sir Alan and ten others, arriving in Shanghai on the 6th. The remaining members will arrive in Shanghai by ship on the 7th. A reporter visited [them] yesterday and</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>all the delegation members praised the warm hospitality of Chairman Chiang and the various ministers, and were deeply impressed by the National Government's desire to promote Sino-British trade. However, their trip to Beijing was only to inquire about the opinions of the various ministers. From now on, they will focus on studying trade issues, but based on their observations in Japan and Shanghai, they feel that this issue is very difficult to resolve.</p>
<h3>Silk Factories Unable to Bear Labor Demands</h3>
<p>Report Committee Resolves</p>
<p>To Await Official Decision</p>
<p>The silk factories in this city previously declared a complete shutdown due to sluggish sales, losses, and depletion of funds. In order to maintain the livelihood of the workers, they were urged to resume work, with a total of thirty-two factories resuming operations in the city. However, the Eastern District Workers' Union opposed the reduction of wages, leading to disputes. The Social Affairs Bureau intervened to mediate, and the workers' monthly salary was calculated at 85% of the original price, with silkworm moths and other items remaining the same. Unexpectedly, the female workers raised new demands, requesting that the previously cancelled wage increases and Sunday bonuses be restored, arguing that the matter was unfair and requesting assistance from the Social Affairs Bureau. Director Pan sent staff member Wang Bing to convene a meeting of representatives from both labor and management to mediate. The labor representatives insisted on restoring the wage increases, and the matter was not resolved. Yesterday (the 7th), the Shanghai Silk Manufacturers Association held an executive committee meeting at 4:00 PM, attended by Shen Huachen, Zhu Jing'an, Zhang Peishen, Huang Jinfan, Wu Shenbo, Xu Yunjiang, Sun Rongchang, and other factory representatives, a total of over thirty people. Shen Huachen presided over the meeting as usual. First, the chairman reported on the proceedings of the mediation meeting attended by the three representatives at the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the Social Affairs Bureau had scheduled another mediation meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow (the 9th) and that a decision should be made on how to respond. After discussion, the general opinion was that it was absolutely impossible to start production in the current silk market, and each bale of silk would result in a loss of over three hundred taels. Therefore, even if wages were slightly reduced, it would still be impossible to maintain operations. It was hoped that the factory owners could make some efforts to revitalize the silk market, so that the workers could barely maintain their livelihoods, demonstrating the spirit of mutual assistance between labor and management. Therefore, the factory owners reluctantly made efforts to raise funds and transport raw materials with high costs and heavy deposits to the factory in order to continue production. The workers, knowing the trend of the environment and their own living conditions, were also at peace with their work. Now, a small number of people, based on their representative positions, aimed to seek benefits for the workers, and their advocacy of the entire problem was, in fact, legitimate. However, everything should be based on the trend of the environment in order to avoid being divorced from reality. If the union can indeed protect the interests of the workers, the most important thing at the moment is not this, but to first focus on securing the workers' livelihoods. Because eight or nine out of ten workers in all factories in Shanghai are unemployed, it is more important to secure the workers' livelihoods in this trend than to seek the workers' interests. If the factory owners are required to increase their burdens based on the agreement at the moment, it is inherently impossible in principle. In fact, the result is the opposite. Factories that are already closed will have no hope of starting production in the short term, and factories that are already open will inevitably gradually close down. The result is not only that the workers will not be able to obtain benefits, but it will also cause the workers to lose their jobs and affect their livelihoods. The fact is that it is impossible to conceal or decorate it. The unanimous vote was that the factory's request was difficult to bear due to its strength, and it should be left to the civil affairs office to weigh the pros and cons and make a ruling. It was decided that Shen Huachen, Zhang Peishen, and Xu Yunjiang would be sent as representatives to attend the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation meeting on the 9th. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>

Resolution: The deadline is extended to January 1931. The completion and reporting must be handled.</p>
<h3>Shangrao Academic Association Presents a Telegram Requesting Communist Suppression</h3>
<p>To Chairman Chiang of the Nanjing National Government: Our Jiangxi is unfortunately frequently subjected to Communist bandit disasters, and the people are suffering deeply. The counties are located in remote border areas and are considered bases by the Communist bandits. There are not many stationed troops, and the damage is particularly severe. The counties have been lost twice, and the vitality has been completely destroyed. White bones are piled up like mountains, and the survivors are displaced and in distress. The scale of the catastrophe is unprecedented. Subsequently, the Central Government calculated and attacked the Yan-Feng rebellion, and the main forces were transferred to the front line. The Communist bandits took advantage of the situation and directly advanced towards Poyang, with a small number of bandits stubbornly defending their nests. However, they were unable to attempt to seize the county seat again, and the people were able to steal a moment of peace. Now, Ruan Zhaochang returned from Anhui to Jiangxi and directly attacked Jingdezhen and Leping. Hu Zuyu's brigade also approached from Xun towards the east. The Communist bandits were unable to resist and led their troops back, while the county area alone had no military protection. It will directly become a bandit den. Alas, how can the survivors of this catastrophe bear to be trampled on again? Therefore, we send this telegram to your office for review, requesting that you urgently dispatch elite troops to enter Jiangxi from Zhejiang to provide assistance and achieve the effect of encirclement. We await your orders with utmost urgency. Xie Yongling, standing committee member of the Executive Committee of the Shangrao Academic Association in Shanghai, weeps and bows.</p>
<h3>Construction Bureau Measures Tangbei Road in the County</h3>
<p>Starts Today</p>
<p>The Tangbei Road on the Song-Shanghai Line has long been planned by the Construction Bureau and will be built this year. However, since Yu Tang was also planned to be dredged this year, the county government was concerned that the people's strength would be insufficient, so it ordered the bureau to postpone the project temporarily. Now, since there is not enough time for Yu Tang, it has been postponed to next year. Therefore, the bureau was ordered to actively carry out the expropriation of land for the Tangbei Road project and has scheduled to start work on the 16th of this month. It is learned that Director Wu believes that the start of the Tangbei Road project is approaching, so he has specially dispatched Huang Runshao, director of the highway department, and Gong Yu, chief of the technology section, to lead surveyors to survey the route in the countryside, which will take about three or four days to complete. It is also heard that the county government has appointed Peng Zhaotang, district chief of the second district, and Yang Fulin, district chief of the third district, as section chiefs for the Tangbei Road land expropriation and has requested them to quickly report the small section chiefs in each section for appointment.</p>
<h3>The County Government Appoints Committee Members for Assessing Loaned Property</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County and City Accumulated Grain Problem has been repeatedly ordered by the Provincial Government to set up warehouses. It has been decided to first set up an assessment committee to pre-divide the accumulated grain and loan assets of the county and city, and then set up warehouses separately in preparation for famine. The number of committee members has been determined to be eleven, with the county and city each sending five members and each side recommending one person. Now, the list of committee members for this county has been discussed and decided at the 49th county government meeting. The government, the Finance Bureau, the Education Bureau, and the Loaned Property Office will each send one person, and one person will be hired from among the local gentry. Once the committee members from both sides are produced, a formal assessment committee will be established to engage in assessing and dividing the accumulated grain and loan assets. At the moment, the list of county assessment committee members has been determined to include Yu Yanfen from the county government, Lu Dingxin from the Finance Bureau, Shi She from the Education Bureau, Shen Zhou from the Public Loan and Public Property Management Office, and Wang Chengsheng from the local gentry. A consultation has been sent to the City Finance Bureau for verification.</p>

<h3>The Joint Association of Two Coupon Holders Again Requests Redemption</h3>
<p>Again Presented to Chairman Chiang and Minister Song</p>
<p>The Joint Association of Central Bank Temporary Exchange Coupon Holders and National Government Ministry of Finance Treasury Bond Holders previously presented separate requests to Chairman Chiang of the National Government, President Zhuang (Yiyuan) of the Executive Yuan, and Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, requesting consideration of the people's livelihood and the redemption of the coupons. Many days have passed without receiving a reply. Yesterday, a second presentation was made, reiterating the previous request. The original presentation stated, "Presented for the purpose of requesting the recovery of Central Bank Temporary Exchange Coupons and National Government Ministry of Finance Treasury Bonds to comfort the people and maintain their livelihoods. Your associations previously presented separate requests on November 21 and 23 of this year, earnestly requesting approval to recover the Central Bank Temporary Exchange Coupons issued by the General Headquarters of the 15th Year of the Republic of China and the National Government Ministry of Finance Treasury Bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance in the 16th Year of the Republic of China. We believe our situation has been understood, but we have not received a reply, and we are terrified. All the reasons for requesting full recovery and priority redemption have been presented in the previous presentation for your review. We will not repeat them here. However, merchants and people are all operating on a small scale, barely making a living, and cannot be compared to wealthy merchants and big businessmen. Since the suspension of redemption of coupons, the impact has been severe, and the pain is indescribable. Many are on the verge of bankruptcy and are helpless day and night, sighing at the coupons and crying in vain. For three or four years, they have been making a living in the bitter wind and rain. Now, fortunately, the country is unified, the four seas are pacified, and the sun shines again, there is hope for revival. We dare to repeat our previous request without fear of offense. We earnestly request that you consider our situation. If you grant our request, the fortunate stars will shine all the way, and the Buddha will save ten thousand families. We are infinitely grateful. In haste, we present this petition, weeping and not knowing what to say. Presented to Chiang, Chairman of the National Government, Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, and Song, Minister of Finance of the National Government."</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Explaining Business Registration</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Customs Brokers Association Stating: We are writing to inform you that we previously received a letter stating that if there is a "ghost" business using registration as a means of opposition, what methods can be used to remedy the situation, and requesting clarification. We have submitted a report to the Social Affairs Bureau for review, which has been approved and forwarded for investigation. We have now received Instruction No. 4335, which states: "It is hereby ordered that the previous report from the association stating that some counterparts are using registration as opposition and requesting guidance, which has been forwarded for investigation and approval, is hereby informed. Now, we have received Instruction No. 13861 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, which states that the purpose of the professional association is to promote the common interests of the professional and correct the abuses of the business, and that its nature is not to protect the interests of the individual. If "ghost" situations occur, it has no specific provision of relief. Send the order of notification, etc. to the association."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends a Telegram Requesting the Release of Western Cigarettes Already Taxed</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: On the 28th of this month, the Qingyan (Green Cigarette) Association sent a letter stating that the Western cigarette firms, including Fengshengxing, Fengshengyuan, Xiangshengyuan, Yongfu, and Taichang, stated that the green cigarettes were shipped from Lanzhou and paid the state monopoly tax in Gansu Province. The goods passed through Shaanxi Province and paid the required provincial monopoly tax in Henan Province. In the past, the Zhengzhou Tax Office only verified the manifest and allowed passage. Unexpectedly, this time, the Western cigarettes arrived in Zhengzhou, and the transportation was obstructed due to the war against Feng. The merchants' goods could not be transported, resulting in months of delay in Zhengzhou. The merchants' losses are already unbearable. They reported that as the source of chaos has been pacified, transportation is restored, and the goods are about to be shipped, they suddenly received an order from the Zhengzhou State Monopoly Tax Office to levy the previously paid tax receipts because it was the time of Feng Ge's rebellion. Why should merchants be punished? An additional burden is imposed after the fact without prior announcement. This is unjust. The regulations for cigarette classification do not seem to be inconsistent. The authorities have not previously announced that the tax receipts would be invalid and should not suddenly abolish them, causing suffering to merchants. We should be sympathetic to the merchants' suffering and transfer the telegram to the Ministry of Finance, asking the relevant authorities in the province to instruct the Tax Office to quickly release the taxed Western cigarettes. It is convenient for the public. The association has investigated that Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other provinces have long been occupied by Feng's military forces before the end of the war against Feng. All taxes paid by the people in the past, such as land taxes and commodity taxes, have never been announced as invalid by the state after recovery. The rebellious army harassed the people deeply, and the officials of each province did not do similar things for the newly recovered areas after the suppression. The Zhengzhou Cigarette and Alcohol State Monopoly Tax Office has abolished all the previously given tax receipts and ordered the repayment. If this method is adopted, the amount of various taxes paid by the people of Henan and Shaanxi provinces after the war against Feng must be in the tens of millions. The rest of the people can’t stand to be alive for all the various taxes. The ministry should consider it carefully and approve the province. The officials of each province must instruct the Tax Office to quickly release the already taxed Western cigarettes. It would be better to stop this branch and only worry about the gains of the merchants. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is paying attention.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway's 1930 Budget</h3>
<p>Reducing Expenditures</p>
<p>Liu Weizhi, the director of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, issued instructions to the chiefs of various departments yesterday, stating: "Regarding the 1930 budget for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which was previously revised and submitted in accordance with the ministry's order to change the capital expenditure from the table. The Ministry of Railways has now issued an instruction stating that the 1930 budget of the road shows a net profit of 960,000 yuan under the operating section, which is insufficient due to the excessive interest on long-term loans and government funds under the annual section, and that the capital section has been carefully considered and the unnecessary projects have been eliminated. It is temporarily approved for record. However, in the future, for all expenditure items that can be reduced, efforts should be made to economize within the scope of the regulations to make up for the deficiencies. In particular, engineering vehicles and parts should be submitted to the ministry for approval with drawings, samples, and required values for each item before implementation and purchase. In addition to the separate orders, the chiefs of each department should immediately comply with the order and implement it."</p>

<h3>Songkou Outside Blockades Coastal Ports</h3>
<p>After the Haifeng Factional Fighting, It is Now Re-Connecting.</p>
<p>Lu Si and Jue Gang have both reported alarms.</p>
<p>The Coastal Marine and Land Police Team stationed outside Wusongkou recently received intelligence that the two major factions of sea bandits, Pan and Shen, have lost more than half of their strength due to factional fighting. Their remnants still number over a thousand people, with 140-150 bandit ships. Due to the loss of their base, the bandits' food and supplies are about to be cut off. In this situation, the two bandit leaders, Pan and Shen, realized the folly of factional fighting and, through the mediation of a third party, resumed their alliance. They plan to join forces to plunder coastal ports, hoping to reoccupy Lu Si, Da'an Port, etc. After receiving the report, the authorities have ordered the coastal marine and land police team stationed along the coast to work with local defense corps to blockade the coastal ports. All ships entering and leaving the ports must undergo strict inspection, and navigation is prohibited at night to prevent sea bandits from using them to resupply military supplies and food. A few days ago, the Pan bandit faction returned to the coast of Lu Si and landed, occupying Da Honggang, located six or seven miles from Sanjia Town. Fortunately, the marine and land police team and the defense corps joined forces to suppress them, killing over twenty bandits and capturing three plundered fishing boats, driving the bandits back into the sea. At the same time, the Shen bandit faction landed towards Juegang, looting rampantly. The marine and land police corps are currently suppressing them. After these alarms, coastal ports are more heavily guarded than before.</p>

<h3>A Record of Two Women Taking Poison</h3>
<p>Women's Minds Were Narrow</p>
<p>They Attempted Suicide Out of Anger</p>
<p>Yao Defu, a native of Ningbo, who is over forty years old, runs a Huatong Electrical Machinery Factory at 713 Diswei Road, serving as manager and engineer. He has a solid capital base and a large business. He owns a car for transportation. He lives in the Fengshengli, Huishan Road, Shanghai. In addition to his wife, he took Zhu, a resident of Jiashan, as a concubine a few years ago. She is now twenty-four years old and looks beautiful. Therefore, she is deeply favored by Defu. Mrs. Zhu is not happy that her husband always returns late at night. She is afraid that he will go out to seek pleasure and abandon the old for the new. She has repeatedly tried to dissuade him, but to no avail. Yesterday morning at about 3:00 AM, Yao drove back. Mrs. Zhu looked unwell and had a quarrel with him. Afterwards, she felt depressed and took opium in front of her husband in an attempt to commit suicide. Yao Defu tried to snatch it away, but the poison had already entered her stomach. He washed it down with soapy water, but it was ineffective. It was not until after 3:00 PM yesterday that he drove her to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>A Wuxi woman, Ding Tian, who is now twenty-eight years old, lives at No. 136, a certain lane in Yalu Road, Hongkou. Her husband, Ding Xibao, is thirty years old and works as a tutor in the Tangjinji Iron Factory in Tilanqiao. They have a daughter, Haokou Changain, who is eight years old, and a second daughter who is only three years old. Last month, Ding arranged with the neighbor to order milk, and it has been a month. The two sides argued over the price of two and a half yuan and three yuan. Upon hearing of the relationship, Ding was willing to pay half a yuan to settle the matter. Yesterday morning, his wife found out and roared loudly. Eventually, she started a fight. After the neighbors persuaded her to stop, she swallowed opium after her husband went out. She was quickly discovered, and she called Ding Xibao to come and hire a car to send her to Tongren Hospital. She was transferred to Guangren Hospital for treatment. According to the doctor, she may lose her life.</p>
<h3>Communist Leader from Rugao Arrested in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Ding Xifu was arrested for murdering three sons of the village leader, pointing to it as a demonstration leader.</p>
<p>Din completely denied everything.</p>
<p>At about 1 o'clock yesterday morning, Cheng Yaolin, the patrol chief in charge of the second district of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, was patrolling with several policemen near the Tangjiawan vegetable market when he caught sight of two men resembling villagers mutually twisting each other. They immediately stepped forward to inquire about the situation. One of them replied that the case was serious and had to be taken to the bureau for explanation, requesting assistance. Patrol Chief Cheng took the two men to the Second District General Office. After a detailed interrogation by District Chief Wang, the plaintiff, Ding Zhongshu, confessed that he was 36 years old, a farmer from Rugao. He said that the defendant, his cousin, Ding Xifu, was a Communist leader in the county. In July of this year, the Communist Party of the county demonstrated and killed Yan Zhengci's third son, Erchong, at Xiajiawan in the southwest township. The county government found out that the case was initiated by Xifu, but he immediately fled to Shanghai. The county government issued a wanted notice. The Rugao Wangjiashi Defense Corps detained his elder brother, Ding Zhongyi, and his younger brother, Zhongchao, and ordered them to hand over Xifu, so they had no choice but to come to Shanghai to look for him. Unexpectedly, they met him on the way in Tangjiawan, so they arrested him. Ding Xifu, 20 years old, who now lives at No. 3 Berlinli, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, and was once the adjutant of the Second Battalion of the Second Brigade of the 27th Division of the National Revolutionary Army, completely denied the case of instigating the killing of Yan Erchong in the July riot in Rugao.

<h3>Russian Boy Sent Back to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Recently, a fourteen-year-old Russian boy in Shanghai, without obtaining a passport, secretly boarded a ship to Hong Kong, intending to travel to America from there, displaying remarkable courage and ambition to cross the ocean and travel thousands of miles.

Upon arriving in Hong Kong, the boy was apprehended by the local port police and immediately detained. The police telegraphed the French Concession police in Shanghai to inform them and arranged for the boy to be transported back to Shanghai on the Taikoo Shipping Company's Shandong ship.

<p>Zhou A'ju Says He Repeatedly Abused Her</p>
<p>Ding Keqin, a native of Changzhou, is eighteen years old and a merchant. Last year in Shanghai, he became acquainted with Zhou A'ju, a nineteen-year-old woman from Ningbo.

Recently, the woman's attitude suddenly changed, and disagreements arose frequently. A few days ago, A'ju suddenly left without saying goodbye. The next day, Ding searched everywhere for her and discovered that his wife had been seduced by Song A'mao, which caused this change. He hired lawyer Jin Yu to draft a complaint accusing his wife of running away with belongings and suing Song A'mao for seducing a married woman. After going out, A'ju also hired two lawyers, Yu Zufeng and Bian Jialu, to send a letter to her husband, stating that A'ju was young and foolish, resulting in Ding using up all her savings of over 1,600 yuan and being repeatedly abused, making it unbearable to live together.

He was ordered to post bail pending a hearing. At the hearing, Judge Zhu ruled that the evidence presented by the plaintiff in the criminal part of the case was insufficient and dismissed the case. However, considering that the two parties had lived together for a long time, the defendant was ordered to pay the plaintiff 500 yuan in alimony.</p>

<h3>Hongri Police Station Arrests Master Thief</h3>
<p>Robbery, Kidnapping, and All Kinds of Evil Deeds</p>
<p>The thieves Li Wenyuan, Zhuang Shunqi, Gao Yongsheng, Li Peng, Xu Wenqing, Wang Yongqing, and the women Li Gu, Xi Yang, and Li Fengmei, totaling nine people, were recently apprehended by the Hongkou Police Station. They seized items such as guns and pawn tickets. An investigation was launched and it was discovered that Gu Yuanruo, a shareholder of the Yongshengchang Gold Shop on Beijing Road, was ambushed by Li and his gang on the evening of November 9, 1927, while riding in a car to dinner at Yipinxian, intending to kidnap him. Gu, carrying a self-defense pistol, immediately fired a shot, causing the thieves to flee unharmed. Soon after, Gu received threatening letters and was defrauded of 800 yuan by Li Wenyuan and Li Pengfei. On the evening of the 23rd of last month, the home of Dr. Wang Jicheng in Gujia Lane was robbed of 489 yuan. On the night of October 18th, the home of Jiang Jinwu, a storyteller at 359 Jiaxing Lane, Tianjin Road, was robbed of 142 yuan. On the morning of October 17th, the home of Shen Wu at 359 Dongtangjia Lane was broken into, but the thieves fled without stealing anything after she managed to sneak out and report to the police. These three robberies were committed by this group. Zhang Chongxin, the owner of the Zhang Chongxin Sauce Shop on Fujian Road, was also kidnapped. After the police cracked the case and the kidnappers were convicted, Li Pengfei sent a letter to Zhang saying that he had repeatedly provided opium to Zhang while he was held captive and that many of his comrades were now in jail with their families struggling to survive, demanding 5,000 yuan. Li confessed to writing the letter while in police custody. The 93 pawn tickets that were seized have been traced to various pawnshops, and many of the stolen goods have been recovered. The police summoned witnesses and sent the thieves to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Ge conducted a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the investigation. Gu Yuanruo, represented by his driver Yu Zhenwu, testified about the kidnapping attempt, but could not identify the thieves due to the passage of time. Wang Jicheng testified that he was not at home when his house was robbed, so he could not identify the thieves. The other victims also could not identify the thieves. The defendants Li Wenyuan, Zhuang Shunqi, Gao Chengsheng, and Li Pengfei confessed to the kidnapping and robbery. The police lawyer requested that the charges against Wang Yongqing be dropped due to lack of evidence and requested a postponement for further investigation. Judge Ge ordered Wang Yongqing to be released on bail and the other defendants were remanded in custody for further questioning.</p>

<p>Chen Youzhong, a native of Yancheng who pulled a rickshaw and lived in Rihui Port, was pulling a passenger from Longhua to Xietu Road at around 12:00 PM yesterday.

<p>The police arrived at the scene and transported Xu to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Requests Reinstatement of Permit Deadlines</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office stating: On the 22nd of this month, the Shanghai Seafood and Grocery Association reported that recently, the Customs has classified dried goods such as dried mussels, dried shrimp, dried squid, dried kelp, and dried bamboo shoots as fresh goods and shortened the permit deadlines. The original three-year permits for foreign goods have been shortened to six months, and the one-year permits for domestic goods have been shortened to four months. This makes it difficult for merchants to pre-load goods for export within the deadline, otherwise the permits will expire, and the goods will be subject to double taxation. How can they bear the heavy burden at a time of economic downturn? Also, pre-loading goods for export is practically impossible. Merchants must have goods to await customers, and cannot expect customers to wait for goods. For example, when new dried goods are produced, merchants must store them to await customers. If the goods sell well, they can be sold out in a few days. If sales are slow, such as with dried mussels and squid, it may take a year to sell them, or they may be stored for two or three years. If the permit deadlines are shortened, the goods that expire will inevitably be taxed twice, and the selling price cannot be increased due to the heavy tax. This is one reason why the permit deadlines cannot be shortened. If customers are expected to wait for goods and buy as they sell, merchants will have no inventory when customers from various ports arrive to order goods. Therefore, they will have to purchase goods from outside or from the interior. However, the delays involved will not allow them to arrive in Shanghai in a short time, let alone reach various ports. Then, those waiting to buy will not have goods, and those needing to sell will not have goods. The impact on business will not be limited to the merchants. This is another reason why the permit deadlines cannot be shortened. The matter concerns the survival of the industry. Therefore, nine samples of Chinese and foreign dried goods are attached, urging the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward the matter to the Jianghai Customs to promptly reinstate the original permit deadlines to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Nine samples of dried vegetables are also attached. Based on this, it is found that the dried mussels and other goods are completely dry goods and cannot be equated with fresh goods. It is appropriate to send a letter to request that your Chamber forward the matter to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office and the Customs Service to reinstate the previous permit deadlines of three years for foreign goods and one year for domestic goods to protect goods and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. It would be a great act of kindness. Nine samples of dried goods are attached for your inspection. This is addressed to the Jianghai Customs Superintendent's Office.</p>

<h3>Both Railroads Improve Conductors' Treatment</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railroad Traffic Departments are hereby making improvements regarding the treatment of employees and rewarding diligent work. It has been found that the conductors assigned to the passenger and freight trains on both railroads (i.e., the trainmasters) often experience crowded cargo, loading and unloading at each stop, or engine damage and insufficient power along the way, resulting in delays and extended working hours. The Railroad Traffic Department heads have decided to improve the treatment of diligent workers and have set forth the following incentive measures: Any employee working on a train that is delayed for three hours or more will be given full pay for the day and allowed to rest for one day as a reward. Any employee working two hours or more will be given half a day's pay, but will not be allowed to rest the next day and will continue to work as usual. If they do rest, the extra pay will be cancelled. A notice has already been sent to each section to verify the timetable and submit it for review, so that it can be included in the monthly payroll, effective immediately. You are hereby ordered to comply.</p>

<p>The China National Anti-Narcotics Association believes that to adequately prepare for the upcoming International Opium Suppression Conference to be held next year, our delegation must expedite preparations.

It is heard that the counties have begun to handle the matter after receiving the association's official letter. The association has already received reports from Changhua, Huaiyuan, Mengcheng, Quanjiao, Yangyou, Gaochun, Huaiyin, Fenghua, Shengxian, Dongyang, Jiangning, Jintan, Xiuning, Zhangqiu, and Songjiang counties, providing detailed reports on the results of implementing opium suppression in each county and the public's opinions on opium suppression.

<h3>General Record of the Jisheng Society's Disaster Relief Efforts in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Adding a Congee Kitchen in Wugong: : : Allocating 10,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society has repeatedly received urgent letters and telegrams from Director Lu and Director Dai of the Shaanxi Branch, detailing the disaster situation in Shaanxi Province. Due to the recent drought after the autumn harvest, the people are suffering even more. Of the province's 92 counties, the Society is only providing disaster relief in Wugong County, where it has already established two disaster relief orphanages and two congee kitchens. However, the benefits are far from sufficient for the large number of disaster victims, so two or three more congee kitchens must be added. Even if the economic situation is difficult, at least one more should be added to do our best to relieve the disaster. After receiving the telegram, the Society felt that the disaster was so severe and the funds were so limited, they had no choice but to try their best. Fortunately, an old lady and a lay Buddhist, among others, generously donated money to the Society, so it was decided to add another congee kitchen with 10,000 yuan. The news has already been telegraphed to Director Lu and Director Dai to start operations immediately. At this time of freezing weather, with biting north winds, the disaster situation nationwide is most severe in Shaanxi Province. There is no shortage of enthusiastic and kind-hearted people in Shanghai, and there will surely be those who follow the example of the old lady and the lay Buddhist, donating a drop of their surplus and reducing their entertainment expenses so that the mournful cries of those on the verge of death can be given a glimmer of hope. This is what the Society hopes and prays for.</p>
<h3>Statement on the Donated Sale of Japanese Rice in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Willing to Donate Two to Five Jiao Per Stone</p>
<p>To be Used as Basic Funds for Grain Storage</p>
<p>Riri Tso reported that a total of 38,000 stones of old Japanese rice were shipped to Shanghai last month. After the Shanghai rice merchants stopped buying it according to the order of the Social Bureau, the Japanese merchants sold the rice stored in the warehouse at a low price through Japanese rice stores in Shanghai. As of now, only more than 2,800 stones have been sold, and more than 35,100 stones are still piled up in the warehouse without anyone paying attention. Seeing this situation, the Japanese rice merchants were afraid that the delay would cause them to lose both principal and interest. Recently, they sent people to contact Chinese rice merchants, willing to donate two to five jiao per stone of Japanese rice shipped to Shanghai to fund the establishment of a grain storage fund and promising that Japanese rice would automatically stop coming to Shanghai in the future. Although the Shanghai rice merchants did not object to the method of donating for sale, they must obtain the consent of the Chinese government before they can start buying.</p>
<h3>The Henan Provincial Relief Association's Telegram Begging for Relief</h3>
<p>Please Consistently and Urgently Allocate Huge Sums of Money</p>
<p>The Henan Provincial Relief Association's telegram stated (abbreviated title): "We are all aware that the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, Chairman Chiang, the presidents of the various yuan, the ministers of the various departments, and Chairman Xu of the National Disaster Relief Association have sent a telegram stating: 'Henan Province has suffered from wind, locusts, floods, and droughts for years, and the bandits and communists have repeatedly taken advantage of the disasters. The entire territory is devastated. Who knew that Heaven would not be fair, and rebellion would suddenly arise? Millions of troops are fighting in the Central Plains, causing the people of Henan to fall into a state of utter ruin. What crime have the people of Henan committed to suffer this torment? Should not our government deeply sympathize and urgently provide relief? Unexpectedly, after two months of appeals, it is still just empty talk. Recently, we read Finance Minister Hao's telegram, which stated that the post-disaster treasury bonds are only for military use and cannot be allocated. The provinces affected by the war should first raise funds locally and then ask the other provinces to raise and transfer funds to make up for the deficit. Then, they should coordinate with the Central Government to make up for the shortfall, etc.' Upon hearing this order, we felt extremely pained. Henan is in a state of exhaustion after being ravaged and plundered. The entire province is bankrupt. The method of raising funds by ourselves is still to relieve the disaster with disaster, cutting flesh to mend sores. How can we expect to survive? We must wait for the other provinces to raise and transfer funds. No matter how difficult it is, we are willing to help with disaster relief and neighborly assistance. However, the round trip will take at least two months. I am afraid that the actual benefits will not arrive before the remaining people have already perished like dried fish. I believe that the Central Government's financial difficulties are undeniable. However, when Changsha fell, it was only a few days before the government immediately allocated 500,000 yuan for relief. The drought in Qin was pitiful, and the two members, Yu and He, requested that the Fourth Plenary Session decide to issue 8 million in disaster relief bonds specifically. This is because the people are the foundation of the country. Even if we are exhausted, we should not allow them to sink without rescue. Why is there no solution for the Henan disaster, causing such disappointment? The losses suffered by Henan Province in recent years due to the bandits and communists have exceeded millions in each county, and the continuous great disasters have made the situation even worse. The severity of the disaster is ten times greater than that of Shaanxi and a hundred times greater than that of Hunan. Even if it is difficult to allocate huge sums of money at the same time for relief, we should also consider the Prime Minister's intention to support the weak and small, and pay in installments, giving priority to the most urgent cases. This is enough to show that the Central Government's distribution of virtue and grace is based on impartiality and has no regional bias or discrimination. Now, seeing the people of Henan on the verge of death, without thinking of helping them urgently, leaving this piece of scorched earth desolate and barren, what will we use in the future? It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. We hope that you will consider that the survival of the people of Henan is related to the lifeline of the country. Following the example of assisting Shaanxi, quickly continue to issue 20 million in disaster relief public bonds to be cashed for the relief of Henan so that the survivors can be rescued. The telegram is urgent. Please consider it.' It is found that the disaster in Henan is the most serious in the country. If we do not provide urgent relief, there will be no survivors left. We still ask you to have compassion and consistently send a telegram asking the Central Government to quickly raise funds for relief. The Henan Provincial Relief Association, Zhang Fang, kowtows."</p>

<h3>Qitian Stage Compiles Western Language Instructions</h3>

The scenes include the Hall of Yama, Fengdu City, Qitian Palace, and the Five Elements Mountain, all with very novel scenery. In addition, a white horse purchased from Paris will appear on stage. The horse is quite proficient in French and used to be in a circus troupe, so it does not need to be trained to perform. In order to facilitate Western guests, the stage has specially invited someone to compile Western language instructions in English, French, and other languages, which is unprecedented for other stages.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Kerosene Prices</h3>
<p>The prices of kerosene of various brands in Shanghai have always been uniform, and the retail prices in various places are also the same. However, since the two price increases this year, the market prices have suddenly become chaotic. The retail prices in various stores differ by as much as one yuan or several jiao per box. It is said that the reason for this is that the merchants selling kerosene in the interior have experienced sluggish sales due to the high prices and have secretly transported their inventory to Shanghai to sell at low prices, resulting in chaotic market prices. The other day, a large batch of Mobil old brand kerosene was found being transported from Chuansha to Nanshi and sold at reduced prices through brokers. After being discovered by Mobil's managers, they are now carefully investigating the Chuansha manager in order to take measures to eliminate the chaotic prices.</p>

<h3>Review of the National Industry and Commerce Conference and Its Hopes by Mu Xiangyue</h3>
<p>The recent National Industry and Commerce Conference was held in the capital at a time when the National Government's unification was complete. Two hundred and twenty members attended, mostly industry and commerce leaders and academic experts, overseas Chinese, representatives from various ministries and commissions of the central government, representatives from provincial and municipal governments, and responsible personnel from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. A total of 404 proposals and 8 temporary motions were submitted, totaling 412 items. All of them were reviewed separately and submitted for discussion at the conference. Some were passed, some were passed in principle with revised methods, and the fewest were rejected. The members who attended the conference were outstanding individuals from all aspects of the country. The discussion of each case concerned important issues of economic construction. The attitude during the discussion was always based on the overall national interest. The spirit of the conference, which lasted from November 1st to the 8th, was consistent from beginning to end. The spirit of this industry and commerce conference is enough to represent the spirit of our entire nation. It is not only admirable but also can make the general public have unlimited optimism about the future of economic construction.</p>
<p>Although there were as many as 411 proposals in this conference, they can be roughly classified into ten categories. Among them, five should be implemented by the government: 1. Implement protective tariffs. 2. Implement the abolition of likin and the abolition of excessive taxes and miscellaneous fees. 3. Implement a unified currency system and abolish the use of taels and dollars. 4. Implement the construction of basic industries. 5. Implement relief for the unemployed. The above five items are the necessary foundations for economic construction. The fifth item, which focuses on protecting the interests of Chinese and foreign investment as a method of relieving unemployment, is the fairest and most important point. Because in recent years, during the time of revolutionary destruction, many young people did not know that construction was the purpose of the revolution, but only knew how to exert the destructive aspect as much as possible. All kinds of methods were used to the extreme, resulting in panic and stagnation in industry and commerce. Everyone only considered surviving as the goal, and the general production industry declined day by day. Emerging industries had no hope. Although the central authorities repeatedly talked about increasing production, they did not have effective measures to protect the production industry before the military situation was settled. This industry and commerce conference made many contributions to the government and is worthy of adoption. The most important point is to protect the interests of Chinese and foreign investment as a necessary method to relieve unemployment, thereby stabilizing people's hearts and promoting production to open a path for economic construction. I know that the central authorities will have something to comfort the hopes of the business community across the country. Among the resolutions passed by the conference, there are also five that should be worked on by the business community: 1. Concentrate capital and operate jointly. 2. Implement scientific management methods. 3. Improve technology, increase harmony, and production. 4. Pay attention to labor welfare and promote labor-capital cooperation. 5. Promote foreign trade. The above five items are also necessary conditions for economic construction. If capital is not concentrated and operated jointly, even if the government implements protective tariffs, abolishes likin, and unifies the currency system, it will still be insufficient to develop the production industry and resist the oppression of imperial capitalism. Because the common goal of the government and the people in the future is production, which is large-scale production, the position of the government can only eliminate obstacles and ensure safety. The implementation and development of various production industries still depends on the automatic efforts of the people. Or, some people think that concentrating capital and operating jointly has the danger of making the current society more and more capitalist. In fact, this is not the case. It is important to know that the difference between the Principle of People's Livelihood and capitalism is not in the difference in the development of production procedures, but in the fact that the central authorities have considerable control over capital, so that the development of the production industry is not for the benefit of a few people, but so that the general society has a common enjoyment. Therefore, paying attention to labor welfare and promoting labor-capital cooperation are important conditions that must be paid attention to at the same time. If capitalists neglect this responsibility, the government can use legitimate methods to make legal sanctions. In short, China's biggest pain today is insufficient production. We must concentrate our efforts on increasing production. At the same time, we must apply the principle of the People's Livelihood to have considerable control over capital, so that the development of the production industry is suitable for the public interest. This is a common concern of the resolutions of this conference and is of great importance to the future of economic construction. As for implementing scientific management, improving technology, and promoting foreign trade, they are all self-evident in the topic and are all necessary for economic construction, so there is no need to waste time on them.

<h3>Laughing It Off</h3>
<p>— Sea Traveler</p>
<p>Child A: Isn't your father exercising every day to get rid of his weight?</p>
<p>Child B: Yes, he exercises a lot every morning when he gets up.</p>
<p>Child A: Has he lost any weight then?</p>
<p>Child B: A lot. You remember the big blue ship tattooed on his chest? Now it's turned into a little sampan.</p>
<p>Old Gentleman (buying a novel at a bookstore and saying to the shop assistant): I know this novel sells very well and is popular with readers, but are there any vulgar descriptions or plots in the book?</p>
<p>Shop Assistant: None at all.</p>
<p>Old Gentleman: I'm a little worried. Can you guarantee it's completely clean?</p>
<p>Shop Assistant (answering with a smile): It couldn't be cleaner. The protagonist in the book runs a bathhouse, his father is a bleaching clerk in a dye shop, and his mother specializes in washing clothes for people. Isn't that clean enough?</p>
<p>A (returning from a long trip, bragging to his friends about his travels): This time my travels were no different from those of the great Western explorers. I climbed extremely high and dangerous mountains, I crossed extremely deep and rapid rivers, I went to extremely large and desolate forests, and many strange big birds flew down to peck me. I don't know what kind of birds they were—</p>
<p>B: I know, they were woodpeckers.</p>
<h3>The Crowds Throng to See the Plum Blossoms</h3>
<p>— Master of the Plum Blossom Pavilion</p>
<p>When a Peking Opera star comes to Shanghai to perform, it is customary to hold a banquet before the performance. This custom originated with Mei Lanfang and has become a common practice. Mei Lanfang’s arrival was no exception. On the evening of the third day, a banquet was held at Quan Jia Fu restaurant on the Fourth Avenue to entertain people from both the newspaper and opera circles. I was delayed by worldly affairs and arrived at 7:15 PM, only to find the hall packed with no empty seats. Here is a brief account of the happenings before the banquet:</p>
<p>The invitation was jointly issued by Mei Lanfang, Wang Fengqing, Tan Fuying, and Jiang Miaoxiang. However, there were five hosts in attendance. One of them was the famous clown Xiao Changhua, who was invited by Mei Lanfang at the last minute to represent the five petals of the plum blossom.</p>
<p>Yao Yufu did not join the host group but instead served as a greeter. She stood at the entrance, smiling and welcoming guests. Whenever she saw an enthusiastic friend, she would shake hands, offer cigarettes, and pour tea with great enthusiasm. Yufu's assistance played a significant role in Mei Lanfang's fame.</p>
<p>On that day, no fewer than four or five hundred guests arrived, with the majority coming from the opera circle. Only about 20-30% came from the newspaper circle. Lin Wu Shan Ren, who had not attended a banquet in a long time, and Hai Shang Shu Shi Sheng, who was residing in the capital, both attended, adding much luster to the Mei banquet. However, the “Happy Crane” and the “Free Cuckoo” were nowhere to be seen, which caused some concern for the host and the guests. These two gentlemen had become the central figures in banquet gatherings; one can do without other guests, but not without these two.</p>
<p>Liu Huogong usually delivered Mei Lanfang's speech. However, Huogong did not arrive that day, causing great panic about who would deliver Mei Lanfang's speech. I, feeling ashamed and half-mad, and Yi Fen and Zhuan Tao all suggested that I stand in for Mei Lanfang. I replied that I had nothing prepared and that there were so many guests. I would not only stammer but would likely fall flat on my face. After repeated pleas, I was finally spared, but I had already broken out in a cold sweat.</p>
<p>As the banquet was drawing to a close, Mei Lanfang had no choice but to speak himself. Mei Lanfang's speech can be divided into four parts. The first part was that after returning from America, he rushed back to Beijing because of his mother's death, which prevented him from meeting with everyone. The second part was that although he was welcomed by the people of the United States during his performance tour, he did not make any progress in his art and was deeply ashamed of having the name without the substance. The third part was that he would perform old plays for the fans and that the responsibility of improving the drama should be shared by the seniors in the new drama circle. The last part was finally about the purpose of the banquet. The structure was clear, the language was fluent, and he was a skilled speaker.</p>
<p>After the banquet, I went downstairs with Fuying, Fengqing, and Changhua and saw a crowd of people gathered outside the door like a mountain or a sea. When I asked the tea server, he said that they were all there to see Boss Mei and dispersed happily after Mei Lanfang left.</p>
<h3>A Record of Hu Ruosi's Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Qie An</p>
<p>Gong Seren’s poem says, "He has unconventional words and never takes Shi Wang as his master, only opening up a new style." The words are indeed good, but when a style is widely adopted, it effectively makes the originator a master. So why be ashamed of the title? This is also not dissimilar to Confucius's saying that he has never refrained from teaching anyone. Among the painters in Shanghai, Zhang Shanzi and Zhang Daqian of the Dafengtang (Great Wind Hall) are known for their style. Shanzi is capable in painting landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, and animals. He once raised tigers in Sichuan, observing their leaping and rising movements day and night. Therefore, his tiger paintings are extremely vivid and lifelike, as if he is obsessed with tigers. Daqian came from under the tutelage of Nong Ran and Mei Qing, two great masters. He paints with the brushstrokes of bronze inscriptions and stone tablets. His landscape paintings are inspired by Shi Tao and Shi Xi, his figure paintings by Wen Zhengming and Tang Yin, and his flower paintings by Bada Shanren. He is skillful and ancient. In the past, he traveled to the Yellow Sea and Goryeo (Korea). His landscape paintings are also good at realism, and have become even more strange and unrestrained. Since the emergence of Shanzi and Daqian's paintings in Shanghai, the style has greatly changed. The value of Bada Shanren and Shi Tao's paintings in antique shops has greatly increased. Thus, the landscape painting school began to have a detached and ancient style, without the diseases of frivolousness and flattery. Thus, his contribution is great, but because of this, many young students knock on the doors of Shanzi and Daqian, seeking to become disciples. They enter their halls and rooms, and Shanzi and Daqian cannot reject them, like Gong Seren, bound by Confucius's words. Hu Ruosi started in the Dafengtang at a young age, responsible for the duties of serving wine, sweeping, and taking care of brushes and ink. Now, at fifteen years old, his painting laws are like Meng Jin, and he wants to test Hua Tuo. His copying of the two masters is so complete that he cannot work without being like each other. How can the tiger warriors of Zhonglang surpass the disciples of Confucius and Zixia? Therefore, Shanzi and Daqian are good at teaching, and Ruosi is good at learning. We can know two things from one. On the 5th of this month, Ruosi displayed his works. The works on display can be hundreds of points, all of which are the essence of the Dafengtang. All who see Ruosi can imagine the school of Shanzi and Daqian. I, as such a person, want the world to know that the teacher-student relationship cannot be abolished and that being a teacher is not something to be ashamed of. Gong Seren's poem was probably inspired by this. We also ask Shanzi and Daqian to raise their beards and smile.</p>
<h3>A Record of Longevity Stars Singing Songs</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from my cousin Yu Lujun from He, describing his participation in the Shengze Hongli Opera Society's amateur singing performance. Among the opera friends, there were four elderly people over the age of sixty who collaborated on a play, which was very popular among the local people. I have extracted the general outline to put into this story.</p>
<p>Shengze is a large town bordering the two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, with thriving commerce, especially silk merchants. The Hongli Opera Society was organized by silk merchants Zhou Chengfeng, Chen Zixin, and others. The address is in Zhongjia Lane in the town. The Society initiated an invitation to opera friends from Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Lili to come to sing amateur opera to celebrate the birthday of their fellow member, Ye Guiyun. The first day, they sang twenty-four excerpts from narrative ballad singing at wine houses, small banquets, and the Qiaocu Hall meeting house. The singers at the hall were four elderly members of the Society. Ye Guiyun, who is eighty-one years old, played the young female role. Qian Yongqing, who is seventy-one years old, played the main female role. Zhang Zixiang, who is sixty-seven years old, played the official role. Wang Jingzhai, who is sixty-six years old, played the male role. Although they are all over sixty years old, they are all energetic, with clear voices, accurate pronunciation, and skillful dialogue. From beginning to end, they do not slack off and show no signs of fatigue. According to Ye Guiyun, he has been singing this opera since he was twenty-one years old, and now it has been a full cycle of sixty years. It is rare in the world for elderly people with wrinkled skin and gray hair to play the roles of young men and women and be welcomed. It is generally believed that this quartet of longevity stars singing opera can be compared with the old family friend of the Peking Opera world, Sun Juxian, and is also a good phenomenon in the Kunqu opera world.</p>
<h3>A Word to Xue Die</h3>
<p>— Shou Ou</p>
<p>The dissolution of the engagement between Hu Die and Lin Xuehuai has now become a matter of great public attention. The letters exchanged between the two sides have been nothing but attacks. I have known the two gentlemen for almost three years, and although we are not close friends, we are still acquaintances. Moreover, I do not show any favoritism in matters of feelings. After the incident, I tried my best to mediate, hoping that it would not lead to a break-up, but unfortunately, things did not go as planned. Both sides have gone to extremes, and I have withdrawn and become an observer.</p>
<p>Reading the recent newspapers, I learned that the two gentlemen have reached a state of great tension, and a court battle seems inevitable. Moreover, I noticed that what they are arguing about has gone beyond the original issue of dissolving the engagement. Although it is said that there are no good words in quarrels, I am afraid that the reputations of the two gentlemen will be greatly diminished from now on. What a pity!</p>
<p>Moreover, the two gentlemen have been in love for four or five years. Now that they are forced to dissolve the engagement, how can they forget their past feelings? If Xue Die can think of this, it will not be difficult for her to realize that this matter can be easily resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>I must state that Lin Xuehuai's engagement of lawyer E Sen was entirely of his own accord. Lawyer E's nickname is Lü Gong, and he knew Lin Jun earlier than I did. Xue Die's engagement at the Moon Palace was one of his congratulatory events. This is an undeniable fact. Outsiders, not knowing the basis of any rumor, have insisted that Lin's engagement of E was arranged by me. This is a strange story of mistaking a winter melon for an eggplant.</p>

<h3>Travel Notes from Nanyang (93)</h3>
<p>— Linghua</p>
<p>On May 26th, 27th, 28th, and 3rd of this year, Burmese monks and Indian workers (referred to as "black Gini people") engaged in a large-scale clash. More than a thousand Gini people were killed. Burmese young monks led the rioters, followed by the masses. The Indians worshipped the monks, but the monks still killed them. Some fell into the water and died, and some idle black people were also hunted down and killed. At that time, onlookers felt injustice, but they only watched and declared. The origin of this incident is worth pondering. Why couldn't the British government protect the lives of Indian workers under British rule? This was because the British did not want India and Burma to be united, so they did not intervene, and the police were lax.</p>
<p>Breaking the relationship between India and Burma was a success of British diplomacy. Master Daojie commented on this matter as being similar to the Hometown Association Parade of Taiwanese people. The Taiwanese people's Hometown Association Parade was because the Taiwanese people did not forget their motherland. Because of this, they were uneasy in Taiwan and thought about the movement. The Japanese detected this and encouraged them, saying, "You love your ancestral home, why not form a team to visit your country?" The young people were delighted and formed a team of several people to visit Fujian. When they arrived, the Chinese thought they were Japanese. They came in large numbers and did not know why. They asked the Japanese consul. The Japanese consul ignored them and told the young people, "You can move freely in your ancestral country." The young people were delighted, but there were many people and no order. The Taiwanese caused the Chinese to be uneasy, thinking that Japanese people were coming to disturb them. Thus, there were conflicts and killings. The Japanese also ignored it. Then, the Japanese consul told the young people, "Now that you have returned to your ancestral country, the people treat you like this. You don't have to think about your hometown next time." From this time on, Taiwanese Chinese people did not dare to think about their hometown. The British caused Burmese people and Indian people to conflict, as a wonderful usage.</p>
<p>On the 9th, while traveling in the city, I saw a large umbrella with a diameter of four or five feet under a tree at a crossroads on the side of the road. Next to it was a mat shed, and in front of it was firewood with a raging fire. A gray-haired meditator was sitting naked in front of the fire with only a few inches of short pants on his crotch. His whole body was covered with firewood ashes, and he was sitting upright. At first, I suspected it was a dead corpse. When asked, it was a living person. His eyes were half-closed and he did not speak. When I asked his neighbor, he said that he had been here for more than a year. He sits two or three times a day, each time for two or three hours. He only drinks milk, about one catty per day, and does not eat. He showers twice a day and has never been sick. He stays under this shed all night. People give him money, but he does not accept it. If they give him cakes, he distributes them to his neighbors. My fellow traveler, Zhong Yugong, said that he often saw him when he was a student. According to this, he is the so-called fire-worshipping Brahmin heretic.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (331)</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 16: Cui Xiu Diligently Asks the Teacher for Words, and the Heroines Hold a Generous Banquet in the Brothel</p>
<p>A Su has sincere intentions towards Luyi and will not compete with her for business. She feels that their Puqing Lane is a decades-old brothel, and it is enough to rely on a few old customers. She does not want to make money from the newly arrived spendthrift nouveaux riches. Secondly, she cannot rely on the superficial, slick, and fraudulent people. She knows that Luyi is a teacher, and does not have many customers, except for Zuo Shichen. She strongly suggests that they should not make a fuss with He Ershao anymore. After the new year, wait for their sister to furnish the room and help her a lot. She also pre-ordered Luyi's opening wine after entering the arena next year, and also taught Long Ziyun and Lin Fanzi to come and support the show. Luyi said to Zuo Shichen that her mother advocated furnishing the room by herself. She said that it is not free to work for others. A Su treats me very well, like my own sister. However, A Su's mother is a very formidable person. People say that she is a smiling tiger, but she treats me well. I don't think she's so terrible. According to my suggestion, I will give it to others for one or two more sections, and then furnish the room myself. Now, apart from you, there are no customers, and the room is upstairs, which makes people very anxious. Zuo Shichen said that your mother has this adventurous spirit, so she must have a certain grasp. Customers also slowly increase. Who is born with customers? If you say that no one is making a fuss during the opening, I can get a customer for two consecutive days. If you teach me to invite customers for three days, I can also do it. However, if I invite customers for two days, my friends may not run into each other. If I invite customers for three days, I can only use that group of customers again. Luyi said, you only ask me to invite customers once, and I will consider it a three-day fuss. You're the package, or the band singing? There isn't even a single band singing. You can't eat more than a dozen dinners a night and invite me more than a dozen band singing. Zuo Shichen said, then I will invite customers for two days. Luyi firmly stated that she didn't want to ask the reason. She said one thing is to ask you for the second thing, and she blushed and didn't say anything. Then slowly, she said what kind of thing do people look like? Zuo Shichen said, OK, then I will follow your words and only ask once. If you really don't have it for two days, I will teach Long Ziyun and Lin Fanzi to invite, OK? Luyi said that although Long Sishao has asked me for a few innings, he originally worked for the Bao family. Teaching him to invite customers is only afraid that the Bao family will not be impressed. Lin Dashao is even more polite. Although he has also turned over two innings, they were all hard-written by you with bureau tickets. Zuo Shichen laughed and said, people who eat the hall business, you are so humble that you don't need to come out as an official, but you are still in the high-rise building doing a quiet and virtuous lady.</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Prices Soar Last Week</h3>
<p>Repeatedly Seen New Records: 616.3 Taels</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Also Contracted Repeatedly: Shorts Endured the Pain of Covering</p>
<p>The strength of the rise was comparable to that of summer. The surge in gold prices last week was extremely fierce, comparable to that of June this summer. However, the changes were also dramatic, with the waves surging and the situation being extremely difficult to handle. Each day saw fluctuations of four to five taels. From the beginning of the week, it trended upwards, with the lowest price reaching 595.9 taels. After that, it frequently broke through the 600-tael mark. This was because overseas silver prices and local exchange rates contracted repeatedly. In general, shorts endured the pain of covering due to the pressure, so new records were repeatedly seen in the gold market, and it almost reached its peak. By Friday, a new high of 616.3 taels had appeared. During this week, it rose by 20.04 taels. The final result was a sharp increase of 20.06 taels compared to the previous Saturday. Most of the major players were optimistic. However, the Yong Sheng Chang Gold Company of the Gold Exchange had to suspend operations due to an embezzlement by a colleague who privately made short positions, even losing as much as 400,000 taels. As for British silver bars, they fell by 5.625 (with differences of 4.375), and the New York silver market contracted by 1.25 cents (with a fluctuation of one cent). The first decree contracted by two and a half notches, and the Japanese exchange rate rose by 3.625, reaching over 40 taels, and still remained within 40 taels. The spot silver market still showed no signs of recovery, and the price was increased by 11 taels, but by the weekend it was only more than 9 taels. Tracing back to June 25th of this year (Wednesday), the gold price once reached a high of 620.2 taels, but there were more than 40 taels of twists and turns in a week, but after that there was a sudden rebound. Observing the market conditions, it is feared that the future may still be optimistic. Here is a detailed record of the general situation during the week:</p>
<p>The changes are also dramatic, with two thoughts zero in retrospect. Since the beginning of the week, the big article and silver prices have continued to fall, and the first decree has also contracted by half a notch, causing the gold market to open up by 3.8 taels, counting 598.8 taels. Subsequently, it once crossed the 600-tael mark. At noon, the big players quickly sold, and suddenly fell to 595.9 taels. The afternoon was slightly better, but there were only two taels of ups and downs, closing at 97.4 taels, an increase of 2.4 taels compared to the previous Saturday (it has risen for three consecutive days, a total of 13.5 taels). On this day, the total was five taels of fluctuation, and the cash began to be settled, but those who had not yet rolled over in November should be settled by the shorts, totaling five tens of public orders (each with seven bars, a total of about 3,800 bars, distributed by the exchange to various long gold companies). The next day, the big article contracted again, the silver price fell slightly, and there was also a telegram from the United States to maintain it. The people's hearts were tired and they trended in the opposite direction. It fell by 3.7 taels when it opened. Subsequently, the first decree turned loose internally, so it had retreated to 600 taels, with a fluctuation of 4.6 taels. The result fell back by 5.5 taels. The next day, the big article suddenly returned to length, the silver price did not change, and the exchange rate was firm, so the gold market returned to its high point. The buying was even stronger in the afternoon, especially when Zhenxiang's closing order reached 606.5 taels, a rebound of 7.5 taels. The total difference for the day was six taels. On Friday, the big article and silver saw another low point, and the first decree contracted twice, a total of one notch. The transaction price of the bank was especially high. The short side urgently covered the foreign merchants. Qiao Ribu vigorously resisted the short, so the gold market suddenly broke through the 610-tael mark. The steps were very good, with a great momentum of soaring into the clouds. At noon, it reached a high of 616.3 taels. In the afternoon, it eased again, falling back by 4 taels, closing at 12 taels, an increase of 5.5 taels compared to the previous day, and a difference of 5.6 taels for the day. On Saturday, the big article and silver contracted again, but the US silver price did not change. The first decree suddenly lengthened by half a notch, but the internal market was weak at first and then strong, with different trends. As for the gold market, the early decline was still strong, and because the silver market had poor footing and there were not many sellers in the United States, people's hearts were frustrated, once reaching 607.5 taels, and there were rumors that Japan had an earthquake, but in fact, it was the news that the first decree had lengthened. However, Yuan Heng, Fuchang, and other major players competed to buy, and then broke through 610 taels. What could be done? The wind and waves were tense, and there were often ups and downs of two or three taels. At noon, the buying was drumming, and the exchange rate was loose. There was a difference of eight taels in half a day. The closing price rose again by 3.6 taels compared to the previous day, a total increase of 16.6 taels in three consecutive days. Here, the high and low prices of the British, American, and Indian silver markets, as well as exchange rate gold prices, are listed separately below:</p>

The December issue of the Reorganization 6% bond saw 1.95 million yuan, the December issue of customs duty bonds saw 1.025 million yuan, and the January issue saw 550,000 yuan. The December issue of the 1928 Rolled Bonds saw 550,000 yuan, and the January issue saw 130,000 yuan. Only the December issue of the reconstruction bond saw 420,000 yuan in trading, while the 7th year issue saw 160,000 yuan, and financial bonds saw 100,000 yuan. There were no transactions for the January issues of any of these. Neither the 2nd series nor the rolled series had a market. Although price fluctuations were inconsistent throughout the week, the changes were not significant. The bond market did not show any major changes throughout the week. Although the reorganization of public bonds is still in progress, there has been no major development, and the prices of various bonds have risen significantly in recent weeks. It seems that major buyers have temporarily stopped, and the market is waiting to see, resulting in declines in the futures prices of Reorganization 6%, Disbandment, Conscription, and Customs Duty bonds, ranging from a few dimes to 1.89 yuan. 96, Reconstruction, 1928 and 7th Year also fell slightly by six or seven dimes, while only financial bonds rose slightly. The bond market situation appears to be quite optimistic. A summary of the high, low, and fluctuations of various bond prices last week is listed below (unit: yuan).</p>

<h3>The Tragic State of the Yarn Market in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Complete Despair: Forecast of 135 Taels</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market was very weak in the past week, showing a significant downward trend. This was mainly due to the global economic downturn and widespread banditry within the country, which weakened the purchasing power of merchants. As a result, inventory continued to accumulate, reaching an estimated 150,000 to 160,000 bales according to Japanese traders. This caused considerable panic among investors. Some manufacturers adopted a negative attitude, cutting their long positions by approximately 20,000 bales due to the unfavorable environment. This further loosened the market. Moreover, the sales of over 10,000 bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn were particularly sluggish, putting heavy pressure on the market. Spot yarn trading almost came to a standstill. By the weekend, Japanese yarn had accumulated over 20,000 bales, and Japanese traders were lowering prices in an attempt to sell, causing prices to fall frequently. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn dropped by two to three taels in two days. This situation further dampened market sentiment. A certain factory with relatively high aspirations was holding onto a price of 40 taels for this month. However, due to the overall trend, it was difficult for one tree to support a collapsing building. Later, as Japanese yarn continued to decline, the 40-tael mark was broken for this month, and new low prices were discovered. The prices for various months were four taels and three or four mace lower than the previous week. The prevailing market sentiment anticipates a price of 135 taels.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Progress Lacking Last Week</h3>
<p>The cotton market was extremely flat at the beginning of the week due to the decline in both American and Indian cotton prices. Spot cotton sales stagnated, and factories made no new purchases. Indian cotton merchants were actively seeking outlets, and prices were very willing to compromise. However, Chinese and foreign manufacturers viewed the global cotton industry as extremely weak and were unwilling to take action. Therefore, there was practically no hope for development. Only merchants from Ningbo and Shanghai, due to bandit disturbances in Hankou and obstructed transportation, were still reluctant to loosen their purchases due to the disruption in supply. The market fluctuated up and down, making it difficult to predict. However, recent imports of Indian cotton have become increasingly lively. By the weekend, there were more buyers due to the surge in gold prices, leading to a slight increase. However, the market fell slightly as some long positions were closed out. Prices for various months were one mace lower than the previous week, and American cotton was five pounds sterling lower.</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Lacking Vitality</h3>
<p>The American cotton market was bleak yesterday, with traders adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Futures prices fluctuated between a gain and loss of one to three thirty-seconds of a pound sterling. Spot prices rose by five pounds sterling. British cotton futures rose by three points, while spot prices fell by two points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by ten points. The Indian cotton market was closed. Original telegraph records are as follows (telegram dated the 6th):</p>
<p>American Cotton Compared to Previous Day Shanghai Standard British Cotton Compared to Previous Day Shanghai Standard</p>
<p>December 10.39 Up 2 27.80 35.65 Up 3 41.60</p>
<p>January 10.42 Down 3 37.90 35.76 342.40</p>
<p>March 10.75 1 39.00 35.98 344.00</p>
<p>May 10.97 1 39.90 Spot 35.66 Down 2 41.80</p>
<p>July 11.16 Flat 40.60 Egyptian 85.51 62.90</p>
<p>November 11.33 Up 1 41.20</p>
<p>Spot 10.50 5 38.20</p>
<h3>Private Estimates of American Cotton</h3>
<p>New York, 5th. The Cotton Receipt Bureau estimates the new cotton production for this season to be 14,392,000 bales, with 12,890,000 bales ginned. Furthermore, the average estimate from brokers at the New York Cotton Exchange is 14,405,000 bales.</p>
<h3>Food Rice Market Downriver Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, approximately 40 boats from various groups arrived in Zhabei, and over 2,000 bags of packaged rice also arrived by ship. Downriver inventories are abundant, and sales are acceptable. The price of white japonica rice was briefly pushed higher, but most importers were neutral. As a result, the price of extra-quality rice was slightly firm, while the price of medium-grade and lower rice had to be discounted. Overall, the market can be described as steady. The price of thin japonica rice has stabilized, and there was initial interest in high-quality rice, but the price was then lowered again due to sluggish sales, settling at 11.80 yuan. The buying interest in extra-quality indica rice was excellent, and demand was strong from all sides, causing prices to rise by half a dime. Special-grade rice may reach the 12.5 yuan mark. Dushan indica rice ultimately proved to be abundant, and the trend remained steady. The retail sales of local indica rice were strong, and customer sales were brisk, keeping the situation stable. The price of top-quality yuan-denominated rice remained depressed, and the market for extra-quality rice could open at 13.5 yuan, but most of the market was only around 13 yuan. Sales of yin yuan rice were sluggish, and the situation was unfavorable, requiring a price reduction of a few dimes. The market opened high at 12 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, over 20 ships arrived downriver in Shanghai South, with varying sales in urban and rural areas. The sales of Changzhou and Wuxi japonica rice were mostly met with a wait-and-see attitude, except for a few stores. The price fell by nearly a dime, and top-grade rice remained scarce in the market, with high-quality rice only opening at 13 yuan. Retail sales of Suzhou and Tongzhou white japonica rice were relatively good, but supply was unusually tight, keeping the market stable. The current situation makes it difficult for the japonica rice market to develop. The supply of early and thin japonica rice from the Southern gangs was quite diverse, but even with inquiries from the Ningbo gang, transactions were only sporadic, and the market turned weak. Top-quality green-top thin japonica rice only opened at 11.3 to 11.4 yuan. The price of yangdu and other indica rice was relatively stable, with sales varying by grade, keeping the market stable. Sales of yuan-denominated rice were slow, and the situation went from stagnant to soft, with top-grade yuan-denominated rice barely opening at 11.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Customer Indica Rice Temporarily Stabilized</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were inquiries about high-grade customer indica rice from various sources in this area. The market price may fluctuate from now on, but customer gangs from various regions have no appetite, and with the end of the year approaching, it is feared that they will only become active after the new year unless there are special circumstances. However, the supply has been limited recently, and the transportation of goods is also facing various difficulties, so there will be no large-scale imports. Yesterday, the overall market price for Jiangxi machine-processed late indica rice was 11.40 to 11.07 yuan for 750 bags, Hunan machine-processed oil indica rice was 11 yuan for 90 bags, and Nanjing machine rice was 10.012 yuan for 150 bags.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw and White Sugar Rose to Eight Taels</h3>
<p>5,000 Bags of Kobe Sugar Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was strong despite the fact that Monday was a holiday in the international settlement and there was little trading in the guild market. No. 24 Dutch raw white sugar was traded at 7 taels 9 mace 5 candareens. Higher grades reached 8 taels ex-warehouse and were in short supply. Fine white granulated sugar was 8 taels 5 candareens, No. 20 medium white granulated sugar was 7 taels 1 mace, No. 18 grade sugar was 7 taels 5 candareens, No. 9 Dutch red sugar was 6 taels 6 mace 5 candareens, and No. 10 was 6 taels 7 mace 2.5 candareens. The Japanese sugar market was even stronger, with Meiji YRO mark at 7 taels 4 mace 7.5 candareens, YP mark at 8 taels 5 mace to 8 taels 6 mace, Minhua YP mark at 7 taels 5 mace, and TK mark at 8 taels 1 mace. Trading was light but the market was very strong. The factory price for Kobe sugar was 5,000 bags, priced at 4 yuan 7 jiao in Japanese gold, plus tax. The market situation was also very favorable. Raw white sugar from Huaxin was being sold at 5 yuan 8 jiao 2.5 candareens, with limited demand but a stable market.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Last Week's Silk Market a Scene of Desolation</h3>
<p>The silk market in Shanghai's foreign firms was almost at a standstill in the past week. This was because silk weaving factories in New York and Lyon were generally unable to sustain themselves due to sluggish silk sales and economic decline, and many had declared bankruptcy. The consumption of raw silk has decreased significantly, and the raw silk market is unattended. Chinese, Japanese, and Italian raw silk are completely without a market. The telegrams from Shanghai Chinese silk merchants to overseas locations have not reported a resumption of work in Shanghai. The 32 silk factories that resumed work earlier are now accumulating silk due to the stagnation of European sales, and no one is inquiring about them. The clamor for the Lunar New Year settlement is growing louder, and they will not be able to maintain their position due to a lack of working capital. Eight more factories have announced a temporary shutdown. White, yellow, and gray silk of all types are lifeless. Aside from the continuous demand for yellow and white factory warp from inland silk factories, and some replenishment of English and Indian warp and weft, the rest are becoming increasingly lifeless. As overseas silk factories close down, the sales of Chinese silk to Europe are stagnant, and prices are high but volume is low. Chinese silk merchants are generally adopting a negative attitude, and there is nothing noteworthy to report besides a chorus of losses. (Telegrams from the American and French silk markets have not arrived by the weekend.)</p>

<h3>Business News</h3>
<p>The Tongchang Automobile Company on Nanjing Road announced that its new Guan Chu Deposit for Automobile Purchases and Credit Deposits officially opened yesterday. Deposits were very enthusiastic, and the Goodyear rubber hot water bottle and Three Guns Factory leather wallet among the various gifts offered were particularly popular with depositors. Two hundred hot water bottles and leather wallets were given away that day, and many other gifts, such as steel coins, calendars, and beauty calendars, were also given away.</p>
<p>The Hu Yiji Advertising Agency announced that the agency was founded by Mr. Hu Yiyi, a native of Guangdong, in Fengcheng, Guangdong during the second year of the Republic (1913). It handles planned advertising, trust services, wall painting advertisements in various ports, as well as parade advertisements, poster pasting, leaflet distribution, window displays, animated advertisements, exquisite fine art drawings, large-character printing, small, medium, large, Chinese and Western documents, the sale and wholesale of goods on behalf of customers, planned construction projects, the sale and rental of real estate, and other matters. The agency is fully equipped to meet the needs of society. Before long, the business advanced rapidly, with the momentum of a thousand miles a day. In the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), branch offices were established in Shanghai, in Baoli Lane, Haining Road. Over the years, the agency's reputation has grown, and the business has expanded. The original premises were no longer sufficient. Now, the new building at the corner of Dong Wuchang Road and Zhabu Road in Hongkou, numbers 250-252 and 151, has been renovated and expanded for business. The grand opening is scheduled for December 11. The future outlook is very promising, as the function of advertising has been recognized worldwide. The industrial development of European and American countries is largely due to the power of advertising, which shows that advertising is a powerful weapon for commerce and an important part of industry. However, the Chinese people have not paid much attention to it in the past. Although it now seems to be progressing daily, it is still lagging behind foreign countries. Mr. Hu of this agency is not only engaged in advertising but also in trust services, with extensive experience, and is a pioneer in the advertising industry in China. On the occasion of the completion of the interior decoration of the new building and the grand opening, those who care about industry and promote domestic goods should know where to inquire.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>The Baixing Grand Theater at the intersection of Laobazi Road and Lisheng Road announced that since Mr. Tan Yongye, the general manager of the Lintai Insurance Company, took over the theater, he has strived to rectify the internal affairs, renovated the interior, and given it a fresh new look. To cater to the tastes of the audience, he has specially invited European and American engineers to install sound film equipment, selected the world's most famous films, and kept prices low to show preferential treatment. This will be realized within two or three days.</p>
<p>The Qitian Stage announced that the second and third acts of "Journey to the West" will premiere on the 12th. Each ticket will come with a free Hongyun brand and Zhizun brand cigarette from the Fuchang Tobacco Company for three days. Not only will you be able to watch the play but also enjoy a good cigarette. Good luck and high official rank are auspicious omens. This is a rare opportunity, so don't miss it.</p>
